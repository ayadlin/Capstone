BACKGROUND: Recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is associated with poor survival.
Platinum-based chemotherapy is often a first-line treatment. Pemetrexed has shown single-agent activity in SCCHN and in combination with cisplatin for other tumors. This trial examined the efficacy of pemetrexed-cisplatin for SCCHN. METHODS: In a double-blind
phase 3 trial, patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN and no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease were randomized to
pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2; n ¼ 398) or placebo plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2; n ¼ 397) to assess overall survival
(OS) and secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Median OS was 7.3 months in the pemetrexed-cisplatin arm and 6.3 months in the placebocisplatin arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-1.02; P ¼ .082). Median progression-free survival (PFS,
months) was similar in both treatment arms (pemetrexed-cisplatin, 3.6; placebo-cisplatin, 2.8; HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76-1.03; P ¼ .166).
Among patients with performance status 0 or 1, pemetrexed-cisplatin (n ¼ 347) led to longer OS and PFS than placebo-cisplatin (n ¼
343; 8.4 vs 6.7 months; HR, 0.83; P ¼ .026; 4.0 vs 3.0 months; HR, 0.84; P ¼ .044, respectively). Among patients with oropharyngeal
cancers, pemetrexed-cisplatin (n ¼ 86) resulted in longer OS and PFS than placebo-cisplatin (n ¼ 106; 9.9 vs 6.1 months; HR, 0.59;
P ¼ .002; 4.0 vs 3.4 months; HR, 0.73; P ¼ .047, respectively). Pemetrexed-cisplatin toxicity was consistent with studies in other
tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Pemetrexed-cisplatin compared with placebo-cisplatin did not significantly improve survival for the intentto-treat population. However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis, pemetrexed-cisplatin showed OS and PFS advantage for patients

INTRODUCTION
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide, with an
estimated 650,000 new cases and 350,000 deaths reported every year.1,2 Inoperable recurrent and metastatic SCCHNs
are generally incurable, thus treatment focuses on prolonging overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS), palliating existing symptoms, and preventing new cancer-related symptoms.3,4 Multiple chemotherapeutic agents have been
shown to induce tumor responses; among these, cisplatin chemotherapy is frequently used for inoperable recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, either as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutics.4,5 The historical median

survival with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy
ranges from 6 to 8 months, with a corresponding 1-year
survival rate of 20% to 40%.6,7
Pemetrexed, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase
and other folate-dependent enzymes,8-10 has been investigated in a phase 2 study of patients with SCCHN as a single agent.11 In this study, 9 of the 34 evaluable patients
(26.5%) achieved a partial response (median time to treatment failure, 3.9 months; median OS, 7.3 months).
These results, together with data from pilot studies investigating pemetrexed with cisplatin for SCCHN (data on
file) and data from trials in other solid tumors,12,13 suggest that pemetrexed may have activity in patients with
recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. To explore this hypothesis, a phase 3 trial was undertaken to compare the OS of
patients treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin with that
of patients treated with single-agent cisplatin. Cisplatin
was chosen as the control arm because at the time of trial
initiation (2006), it was considered a standard well-tolerated treatment, and had been used as the comparator arm
in the 2005 phase 3 trial examining the combination of
cisplatin and the biological agent cetuximab.6 In addition,
single-agent cisplatin was chosen so as not to unnecessarily
increase the toxicity of the comparator arm, because at the
time, no platinum-based chemotherapy doublet had
improved survival time compared with single-agent therapy in this population; rather they had resulted in the
expected increased toxicity.5,6,14-16
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Patient eligibility criteria included histological or cytological diagnosis of recurrent SCCHN or newly diagnosed
distant metastatic SCCHN, 6 months since completion
of chemotherapy or biological anticancer therapy, and no
prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Other inclusion criteria were 18 years of age; life expectancy 3
months; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 217; measurable or
nonmeasurable disease status as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)18; and
adequate bone marrow reserve and organ function.
Protocol amendments approved after study initiation included changing the requirement that prior surgery
and radiation be completed 6 months before study
enrollment to 4 weeks before enrollment; this was more
in keeping with standard clinical practice. Another protocol change lowered the minimum required creatinine
clearance value19 from 60 to 45 mL/min based on clinical
evidence of the tolerability of the pemetrexed-cisplatin
Cancer

regimen used in this study. In addition, a protocol change
provided for the collection of tumor tissue samples as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue to study genes
involved in SCCHN biology and drug activity by microarray gene expression analysis. No results are available to
be reported because poor microarray performance yielded
no results.
Exclusion criteria included nasopharyngeal, paranasal sinus, lip, or salivary gland cancer; clinically significant third-space fluid that could not be drained; and
central nervous system metastases. Patients were also
excluded if they were unable to interrupt therapy with aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or if
they were unable or unwilling to take folic acid, vitamin
B12, or corticosteroids.
The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines
and was approved by each participating institutional/
ethics review board. All patients provided written
informed consent before treatment.
Study Design and Treatment Plan

This was a global, double-blind, randomized, placebo
controlled phase 3 study. On day 1 every 21 days, patients
received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 (10-minute infusion)
plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or placebo (100 mL saline) plus
cisplatin 75 mg/m2. The cisplatin dose was chosen to yield
a dose intensity of 25 mg/m2/wk, a dose intensity supported by previous randomized trials5,6,14 and shown to
be within the 20 to 40 mg/m2/wk range found to yield
equivalent efficacy in a randomized study comparing a
high and standard doses of cisplatin in the treatment of
advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer.20 Randomization
(1:1) by the technique of Pocock and Simon21 was used to
minimize imbalances among prognostic factors: baseline
ECOG PS (0 or 1 vs 2), prior treatment for SCCHN, distant metastases, prior platinum-based therapy, and
country.
Chemotherapy was administered for 6 cycles;
patients could be discontinued from the study before the
completion of the 6 cycles for disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient/physician decision. Additional cycles were permitted for patients receiving benefit
from study treatment. All patients were followed until
death or study closure. Patients on both arms received
prophylactic dexamethasone, oral folic acid, and vitamin
B12 injection as per the pemetrexed label. Because pemetrexed, cisplatin, placebo, and vitamin B12 were administered at the investigational sites by authorized study
personnel, patient compliance was ensured.

The following were allowed per protocol: dose
adjustments (as per the pemetrexed label), cycle delays
42 days (to allow resolution of toxicities), and concomitant supportive therapies (granulocyte colony-stimulating
factors or erythropoietin) according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines.22
Baseline and Treatment Assessments

The primary efficacy measure was OS. Secondary endpoints included PFS, tumor response rate, safety, time to
worsening, and change from baseline in dimensions of
health-related quality of life (HRQL) using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck
scale (FACT-H&N).23,24
Baseline tumor measurements were performed within
4 weeks before first treatment dose. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was preferred, but chest
x-ray was acceptable for clearly defined lesions. Any palpable tumors were measured within 2 weeks of first treatment.
The baseline assessment method was repeated every other
cycle, and every 6 weeks after treatment discontinuation
until disease progression. Patients who had baseline imaging and at least 1 scan after starting chemotherapy were
considered assessable for tumor response using RECIST
1.0.18 OS and PFS analyses incorporated all randomized
patients on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis.
Patients were assessed for toxicity before each cycle
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events, version 3.0.25 All patients who received at
least 1 dose of pemetrexed or cisplatin were considered
assessable for safety.
The FACT-H&N scale (version 4) was administered at baseline and on day 1 of all cycles to assess and
compare changes in HRQL between treatment arms. This
reliable and valid instrument24 consists of a 39-item scale
organized into 5 subscales: physical, social/family, functional, and emotional well-being, and additional concerns-head and neck, with higher scores representing
better quality of life. The FACT-H&N scores were calculated based on scoring criteria proposed by the developer.23 Results of the FACT-H&N are reported as
follows: the scores for the 5 individual subscales; a FACTGeneral total score (sum of all subscales excluding the
H&N subscale); a Trial Outcome Index-H&N (the sum
of the scores of the physical well-being, functional wellbeing, and H&N cancer subscales); and Total FACTH&N score (the sum of the scores of all 5 subscales). Prospectively defined minimally important differences were
used to calculate time to worsening and to interpret
change from baseline results.26

Statistical Analyses

The study was designed to enroll approximately 790
patients, with 1:1 randomization between the 2 arms. The
median OS with single-agent cisplatin was estimated to be
8 months6; the study was powered to detect a 25%
improvement in OS by showing a median OS of 10
months with pemetrexed-cisplatin. Assuming the true survival hazard ratio (HR) of pemetrexed-cisplatin to cisplatin alone was 0.80, the study had 80% power to achieve
significance at a 2-sided level of .05. An interim analysis
based on PFS was planned after approximately 300
patients had died or experienced disease progression to
assess safety and futility. An independent statistical analysis group performed the analysis for the Data Monitoring
Committee. As reported herein, the final analysis comparing OS between the arms was to be performed after 632
deaths had occurred (20% censoring rate). To compare
the time-to-event endpoints (including the primary endpoint, OS), a stratified log-rank test at a 2-sided a ¼ .05
was used, with the following prognostic factors as stratification variables: PS (0 or 1 vs 2), previously treated for
SCCHN (no vs yes), distant metastasis (no vs yes), and
prior platinum-based therapy (no vs yes). The survival distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method.27 The Kaplan-Meier estimations included
Kaplan-Meier curve, quartiles, and interval estimation
using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Supportive analyses
were done to obtain treatment effect after adjusting for
the prognostic variables using the Cox regression model.28
Prespecified subgroup analyses for OS and PFS were
conducted on important subgroups of patients: ECOG
PS (0 or 1 vs 2), previously treated SCCHN (no vs yes),
prior platinum-based therapy (no vs yes), distant metastasis (no vs yes), age (<50 vs 50 years), sex (male vs
female), race (Caucasian vs non-Caucasian), primary site
of disease (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx,
and other), and prior surgery or radiotherapy within 6
months of randomization (no vs yes). An unstratified logrank test was used to assess the treatment difference within
subgroups, and the Cox regression model was used to test
the treatment-by-subgroup interaction. Tumor responses
were compared between treatments using unadjusted normal approximation for differences in rates. The changes
from baseline in the FACT-H&N subscale scores were analyzed using mixed-model repeated-measures analysis
with treatment, baseline score, visit, and treatment-byvisit interaction as fixed effects, and with patient nested in
treatment as a random effect in the model; missing data
were assumed to be missing at random. The incidences of
toxicities, hospitalizations, and concomitant medication
use were analyzed using the Fisher exact test.

RESULTS

Treatment

Patients

Seven hundred seventy-seven patients (97.7%) received
study treatment consisting of at least 1 dose of pemetrexed
or cisplatin (pemetrexed-cisplatin: n ¼ 392; placebo-cisplatin: n ¼ 385). A median of 4 cycles was administered on
the pemetrexed-cisplatin arm and 3 cycles on the placebocisplatin arm. More pemetrexed-cisplatin patients completed 6 cycles than did placebo-cisplatin patients (126 vs
103, respectively), whereas more patients discontinued
from the placebo-cisplatin arm because of lack of efficacy or
progressive disease (217 vs 180, respectively; Fig. 1). The
dose intensity was similar for both arms; for pemetrexedcisplatin, it was 94% for pemetrexed and 91% for cisplatin;
for placebo-cisplatin, it was 96.0% each. Within the PS 0
or 1 subgroup, similar treatment trends were observed.
Dose adjustments (delays or reductions) were less
frequent in patients treated with placebo-cisplatin compared with pemetrexed-cisplatin patients. On the pemetrexed-cisplatin arm, there were 33 pemetrexed and 74

Between December 2006 and March 2010, 114 investigators at 110 study sites in 20 countries (in Asia, Europe,
and North America) screened 952 patients. Among these,
795 were randomized (pemetrexed-cisplatin, n ¼ 398;
placebo-cisplatin, n ¼ 397; Fig. 1). The baseline patient
and disease characteristics were well balanced between the
treatment arms, and generally reflected the overall population of patients with SCCHN (Table 1). The distribution
of disease sites reflects the global nature of the trial.
Within the PS subgroups (0 or 1 and 2), the treatment
arms were also balanced. The planned interim analysis
was performed in November 2008 after 301 events and
resulted in the decision to continue the study as planned.
Post-trial analysis showed the number of patients with
prior surgery or radiotherapy within 6 months of randomization was balanced between treatment arms (pemetrexed-cisplatin, 20.2%; placebo-cisplatin, 19.8%).

cisplatin dose reductions; on the placebo-cisplatin arm,
there were 7 placebo and 55 cisplatin dose reductions.
The most common reasons for pemetrexed dose reductions were febrile neutropenia and neutropenia; for cisplatin (on both treatment arms), it was decreased creatinine
clearance.
Efficacy and HRQL

OS for ITT patients on the pemetrexed-cisplatin arm was
not superior to that for patients on the placebo-cisplatin
4698

arm (Fig. 2A), with both arms having 20% censoring and
similar use of postdiscontinuation systemic therapy (Table
2). The median OS times were 7.3 and 6.3 months for the
pemetrexed-cisplatin and placebo-cisplatin arms, respectively (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75-1.02; P ¼ .082). The 1and 2-year survival probability rates were as follows: pemetrexed-cisplatin arm, 30.0% and 9.0%; placebo-cisplatin
arm, 25.0% and 10.0%. The treatment effect on OS after
adjusting for baseline prognostic factors was similar to that
observed in the unadjusted analysis (HR, 0.89; 95% CI,
0.76-1.03; P ¼ .125).

Systemic therapies used in >5% of a treatment arm are listed, along with pemetrexed.

A similar analysis was undertaken among the ITT
population for the secondary endpoint PFS. The median
PFS was 3.6 months for the pemetrexed-cisplatin arm and
2.8 months for the placebo-cisplatin arm (HR, 0.88; 95%
CI, 0.76-1.03; P ¼ .166; Fig. 2D), with 15% censoring
on both arms. After adjusting for baseline prognostic factors, the treatment effect on PFS was similar to that
observed in the unadjusted analysis (HR, 0.92; 95% CI,
0.79-1.07; P ¼ .290). Prospectively planned subgroup
analyses identified PFS advantage for the pemetrexed-cisplatin arm compared with the placebo-cisplatin arm in
both the ECOG PS 0 or 1 subgroup (Fig. 2E; HR, 0.84;
95% CI, 0.72-1.00; P ¼ .044; interaction P ¼ .017) and
the oropharynx subgroup (Fig. 2F; HR, 0.73; 95% CI,
0.53-1.00; P ¼ .047; interaction P ¼ .205).
Figure 3 presents the OS and PFS results within the
PS 0 or 1 subgroup. OS and PFS both favored pemetrexed-cisplatin over placebo-cisplatin across most of the
subgroups (HRs <1).
Tumor response rate (complete plus partial
response) was not significantly different between arms in
the total population, but was significantly higher for the
pemetrexed-cisplatin arm within the PS 0 or 1 subgroup
(Table 3).
Patient compliance with the FACT-H&N instrument was similar between treatment groups (range, 60%89% over 6 cycles). No significant differences in time to
worsening were noted for any FACT-H&N subscale or
total score (Table 4). Likewise, no significant differences
were noted in any change-from-baseline analyses or
FACT-H&N parameters analyzed by PS subgroups (data
not shown).

Safety

Compared with placebo-cisplatin, patients receiving
pemetrexed-cisplatin exhibited significantly greater incidence of drug-related grade 3 or 4 laboratory toxicities
(neutropenia, anemia, and leukopenia), drug-related
grade 3 or 4 nonlaboratory toxicities (febrile neutropenia
and fatigue; Table 5), and need for supportive care (Table
6). Analysis of safety data for various subgroups including
PS (Tables 5 and 6), age, and sex (data not shown) found
subgroups to be consistent with the safety profile observed
in the entire population, with the exception of patients in
the PS 2 subgroup. Patients with PS 2 experienced more
possibly drug-related serious adverse events, more deaths
because of study drug toxicity, and more deaths because
of study disease compared with PS 0 or 1 patients.
Ninety-two patients (23.5%) on the pemetrexedcisplatin arm and 96 patients (24.9%) on the placebo-cisplatin arm died during therapy or within 30 days of treatment discontinuation. The most common cause of death
was disease progression (pemetrexed-cisplatin, 46
[11.7%]; placebo-cisplatin, 75 [19.5%]). Adverse events
accounted for 33 (8.4%) deaths on the pemetrexed-cisplatin arm and 19 (4.9%) deaths on the placebo-cisplatin
arm. On study or within 30 days of discontinuation, 1
patient (0.3%) on the placebo-cisplatin arm died because
of possible study drug-related toxicity (cardiorespiratory
arrest), compared with 13 (3.3%) deaths on the pemetrexed-cisplatin arm (2 deaths each from agranulocytosis,
renal failure, sepsis/septic shock; 1 death each from febrile
neutropenia, bone marrow toxicity, gastrointestinal necrosis, diarrhea, respiratory tract hemorrhage, cardiac failure, and multiorgan failure). Further review of patient

files revealed 3 of these deaths were unlikely to be related
to study drug toxicity. In addition, 4 of the deaths were in
patients with poor PS (PS 2) at study entry, and 2 deaths
were in patients who did not receive proper dose reductions and died from agranulocytosis.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest phase 3, randomized,
double-blind study to date in patients with inoperable
recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. The primary objective
was not achieved, as the ITT analysis of patients on the
pemetrexed-cisplatin arm did not show a significant
improvement in OS over patients on cisplatin monother4702

apy. However, in the subgroup of PS 0 or 1 patients,
which comprised 87.2% of the 795 study participants, a
preplanned analysis showed that pemetrexed-cisplatin
treatment led to longer OS and PFS compared with
cisplatin monotherapy, whereas no significant efficacy
differences were noted for PS 2 patients.
Multivariate analyses from palliative chemotherapy
clinical trials have shown that time to progression and OS
are influenced by factors other than the specific chemotherapy administered. Poor PS, prior treatment, lack of or
minimal response to treatment, and advanced stage or
metastatic disease are among those factors associated with
worse outcomes in patients with SCCHN treated with

systemic chemotherapy.4 These findings suggest that
patient selection can be at least as important as the type of
therapy administered.
PS is a valid and reliable parameter that may be used
as an inclusion criterion in clinical trials because it not
only defines the physical medical condition of the patient,
but is also a prognostic factor.29,30 The same observation
was made in patients with SCCHN in the Vermorken et
al phase 3 study, in which PS had the greatest prognostic
relevance for OS time.31 In that study, a Karnofsky PS
score 80 was associated with a reduced risk of death by
49% as compared with a Karnofsky score <80 (HR, 0.51;
95% CI, 0.37-0.69; P < .001). Thus, PS 2 patients would
be anticipated to have a worse clinical outcome as a group,
as was confirmed in this study.
Cancer

The median OS observed in PS 0 or 1 patients
treated with pemetrexed-cisplatin (8.4 months) versus
that for patients treated with placebo-cisplatin (6.7
months) contrasts with the median OS of 3.5 months versus 3.3 months observed in PS 2 patients receiving the
same treatments. A prespecified interaction test showed a
significant treatment-by-PS (0 or 1 vs 2) interaction, suggesting that pemetrexed-cisplatin effect is significantly
greater in the PS 0 or 1 population compared with that in
PS 2 patients (OS, P ¼ .034; PFS, P ¼ .017). This is a
clinically meaningful difference in this subgroup.
Beyond PS subgroups, other preplanned analyses
looked for evidence of differential treatment benefits in
other subgroups, including primary site of disease.
Patients with oropharyngeal cancer who were treated with
4703

Original Article

pemetrexed-cisplatin showed improvement in both OS
and PFS compared with patients treated with cisplatin
monotherapy. We are not aware of preclinical evidence
that would have predicted this result, nor are there data to
suggest that oropharyngeal tumors express lower levels of
thymidylate synthase, an enzyme in the folate pathway
associated with sensitivity to pemetrexed. However,
human papillomavirus (HPV) has recently been established as a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer, with
emerging data suggesting that HPV-positive tumors are
more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy than
HPV-negative tumors.32 Whereas the greater responsiveness to pemetrexed-cisplatin of the oropharyngeal subgroup within this study may well be because of the HPVpositive status of the patients, data on the HPV status of
patients were not collected because this study was initiated
before the full current understanding of this association.
Tumor tissue collection began midtrial to address this
association and others, but no results were obtained
because of difficulties in the RNA analysis. Future studies
will undoubtedly continue to explore the association
between HPV infection and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy of oropharyngeal tumors. For now, the responsiveness of this tumor type to pemetrexed-cisplatin should
be considered only as hypothesis generating, given the relatively small number of patients in this subgroup.
The toxicity profile of pemetrexed-cisplatin in this
study was consistent with what is already known for this
combination in other tumor types. Pemetrexed-cisplatin
was associated with a higher rate of drug toxicity than placebo-cisplatin, as expected with combination chemotherapy. There were more study drug-related deaths, as well as
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, and fatigue, and thus a greater need for supportive care (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,
hospitalization, and transfusion). However, as detailed in
Table 5, with the exception of neutropenia (11.5%) and
anemia (10.2%), <10% of patients (total safety population) experienced these grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Whereas
the FACT-H&N results did not identify any measurable
difference in HRQL parameters, they also did not identify
any negative HRQL results stemming from the addition
of a second chemotherapeutic agent in the pemetrexedcisplatin arm.
Because SCCHN treatment has evolved since this
study was initiated in 2006, cisplatin monotherapy is not
used frequently for treatment, and when administered as
part of a chemotherapy regimen for SCCHN, is often
used at a somewhat higher dose of 100 mg/m2/3 wk, as
in the Vermorken et al study that compared platinum/
4704

fluorouracil/cetuximab with platinum/fluorouracil.31 Although it is difficult to compare these studies because of
the difference in treatment arms, the OS of the chemotherapy arm of the Vermorken et al trial (7.4 months) is
similar to that of the pemetrexed-cisplatin arm in our
study (7.3 months). In addition, within the chemotherapy
arm of both studies, the subset of patients with oropharynx cancer had a longer median OS than the median OS
of the total population: Vermorken et al trial, 7.9 versus
7.4 months; our trial, 9.9 versus 7.3 months. Because the
Vermorken et al study showed that the addition of cetuximab, an antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor
receptor, improved OS to 10.1 months, a phase 2 study
is underway to examine the PFS after treatment with
the combination of cetuximab/pemetrexed/carboplatin
or cetuximab/pemetrexed/cisplatin (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT01087970). Another study is investigating the impact of bevacizumab, an antibody to vascular endothelial cell growth factor, on pemetrexedcetuximab chemoradiotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00703976).
In conclusion, the results of this study in patients
with inoperable recurrent or metastatic SCCHN demonstrate that pemetrexed-cisplatin combination was not
more efficacious than cisplatin monotherapy for the
whole ITT population. However, it was more efficacious
than platinum monotherapy in patients with PS 0 or 1
and patients with oropharyngeal cancers. In light of the efficacy of pemetrexed-cisplatin in this trial and the known
mild safety profile of pemetrexed monotherapy, a phase
2 study is investigating the benefits of pemetrexed for
treating higher-risk patients who are less likely to
tolerate triplet therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT00293579).
