Route of Intracerebrospinal Fluid
Chemotherapy Administration and Efficacy of
Therapy in Neoplastic Meningitis
Michael J. Glantz, MD1,2; Alixis Van Horn, RN3; Rebecca Fisher, MD4; and Marc C. Chamberlain, MD5,6

BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to determine whether route (intraventricular vs intralumbar) of intracerebrospinal fluid (intra-CSF) drug administration influences progression-free survival in the treatment of patients with neoplastic meningitis, which occurs in 1% to 5% of patients with known cancer. Currently available treatment options
result in modest responses, which is in part a reflection of obstacles to drug delivery into the leptomeningeal space.
METHODS: One hundred patients with clinically and cytologically or radiographically documented neoplastic meningitis because of solid cancers received intra-CSF liposomal cytarabine or methotrexate as specified in a randomized
phase 4 trial. The 2 treatment arms were well balanced for demographic and tumor-related characteristics of known
prognostic importance, including age, performance status, tumor type, extent of systemic and other central nervous
system (CNS) disease, prior CNS therapy, and concurrent systemic chemotherapy. RESULTS: One hundred patients
were randomized and treated (52 with sustained-release cytarabine, and 48 with methotrexate). Progression-free survival (the primary study endpoint) was identical between the sustained-release cytarabine and methotrexate treatment arms for all 100 patients (35 vs 37.5 days, P ¼ .79). When progression-free survival was examined as a function
of route of chemotherapy administration (lumbar vs ventricular), there was no difference for patients treated with
sustained-release cytarabine (29 vs 43 days, P ¼ .35). For patients treated with methotrexate, however, there was a
statistically significant difference favoring patients receiving intraventricular therapy (19 vs 43 days, P ¼ .048).
CONCLUSIONS: Site of intra-CSF chemotherapy drug administration is clinically relevant with short half-life drugs

Neoplastic meningitis is an increasingly frequent and underdiagnosed neuro-oncological complication of primary

central nervous system (CNS) cancers, extraneural solid tumors, lymphomas, and leukemia.1 Despite aggressive treatment
including intracerebrospinal fluid (intra-CSF) chemotherapy, focal radiation to bulky or symptomatic disease sites, and
systemic chemotherapy appropriate to the underlying cancer; despite 7 randomized controlled trials; and despite dozens
of phase 1 and 2 studies of novel drug and antibody-mediated therapies, the prognosis for patients with neoplastic meningitis remains poor.2-15 Mortality in this patient population is partially attributable to progression of extra-CSF disease.1-8
However, neoplastic meningitis itself has proven very resistant to therapy and is typically associated with profound morbidity and death.
This poor response to treatment may in part be related to the short CSF half-life and cell cycle specificity of most currently available intrathecal chemotherapeutic agents.16 As suggested by the first randomized control trial in patients with
neoplastic meningitis, another factor that might contribute to the poor efficacy of intra-CSF therapy is the administration

of chemotherapeutic agents by lumbar puncture.2 Subsequent radiographic and CSF pharmacokinetic studies
support the hypothesis that intraventricular administration produces more reliable drug delivery and more effective distribution throughout the subarachnoid space.17-24
Intraventricular administration requires placement of a
ventricular reservoir, and exposes patients to a 5% to 10%
risk of complications, including hemorrhage, infection,
and device malfunction.25-28 Some patients are unwilling
or medically ineligible to undergo this neurosurgical procedure. In addition, patients who receive prophylactic
intra-CSF chemotherapy (for example, those patients
with acute leukemia or high-risk non-Hodgkin lymphoma) rarely undergo ventricular reservoir placement.
To date, there has been no convincing prospective,
randomized trial demonstrating the superiority of intraventricular over intralumbar chemotherapy administration. As a result, this remains a crucial and controversial
clinical question.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between July 2001 and November 2004, a multicenter,
randomized controlled trial comparing intra-CSF sustained-release cytarabine (DepoCyt, ENZON Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) with intra-CSF methotrexate
in patients with neoplastic meningitis from solid tumors
was conducted at 12 sites in the United States and Canada, and 13 sites in Europe.7 One hundred patients were
randomized to receive either sustained-release cytarabine
(n ¼ 52) or methotrexate (n ¼ 48), using previously pub-

1948

lished drug doses and treatment schedules.4,5,7 The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival
(PFS), defined as time from randomization to neurologic
progression or death. Secondary endpoints included time
to neurologic progression, meningeal disease-specific survival, all-cause survival, cytological response, Karnofsky
performance score (KPS), and quality of life as measured
by the Q-TWiST technique. Q-TWiST is a tool used to
measure how much time a patient spends without symptoms related to cancer and without side effects of cancerdirected therapy.29 The frequency and nature of all
adverse events in each treatment group was recorded.
Study eligibility required a histological diagnosis of
cancer; age 18 years; KPS 60; neoplastic meningitis
evidenced by a positive ventricular or lumbar CSF cytology obtained within 21 days before randomization, or
characteristic signs and symptoms of neoplastic meningitis plus an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography scan indicating the presence of
leptomeningeal tumor; acceptable hematologic, renal,
and hepatic function; absence of uncontrolled infection;
no toxicity attributable to prior treatment; and no concurrent intra-CSF or high-dose systemic chemotherapy. CSF
flow abnormalities were excluded by either MRI scan or
radioisotope CSF flow study.18,19 All patients of childbearing potential had a negative urine or serum pregnancy
test and were required to use an effective method of contraception throughout the study. All patients were
required to provide written informed consent before the
start of any study procedures.

The study protocol and consent forms were
approved by the institutional review board of each of the
participating institutions. Informed consent was obtained
from each study subject.
Statistical Methods
The study was designed to detect a doubling of PFS with a
power of 90% and an alpha of 0.05. Kaplan-Meier plots
of PFS, time to neurologic progression, meningeal disease-specific survival, and all-cause survival were analyzed
using the log-rank test, stratified by region. A Cox regression analysis of PFS was planned to account for the impact
of variables of potential prognostic importance (age, sex,
region, race, tumor type, baseline KPS, duration of meningeal disease, parenchymal involvement, prior intrathecal or systemic high-dose chemotherapy, and prior
radiation therapy to the CNS). The incidence of adverse
events was compared between treatment groups using
Fisher exact test. All statistical tests were performed
against a 2-sided alternative hypothesis. A P value of .05

RESULTS
One hundred patients were randomized and treated (52
with sustained-release cytarabine and 48 with methotrexate). The 2 treatment arms were well balanced for demographic and tumor-related characteristics of known
prognostic importance, including age, performance status, tumor type, extent of systemic and other CNS disease,
prior CNS therapy, and concurrent systemic chemotherapy (Tables 1 and 2). PFS (the primary study endpoint)
was identical between the sustained-release cytarabine and
methotrexate treatment arms for all 100 patients (35 vs
37.5 days, P ¼ .79) (Figs. 1 and 2). There were also no significant differences in PFS between the sustained-release
cytarabine and methotrexate arms for the 49 patients
treated in Europe (35 vs 23 days, P ¼ .061) and the
51 patients treated in North America (36 vs 57 days,
P ¼ .43).
When PFS was examined as a function of route of
chemotherapy administration (lumbar vs ventricular),
there was no difference for patients treated with sustainedrelease cytarabine (29 vs 43 days, P ¼ .35) (Fig. 1). For
patients treated with methotrexate, however, there was a
statistically significant difference favoring patients receiving intraventricular therapy (19 vs 43 days, P ¼ .048)
(Fig. 2). In patients receiving methotrexate and in those
receiving sustained-release cytarabine, there were no

CNS disease, prior CNS therapy, or concurrent systemic
chemotherapy based on site of drug administration.

DISCUSSION
Despite considerable research and numerous clinical trials, the diagnosis of neoplastic meningitis remains a morbid disease with <15% 1-year survival.1-7 This poor
prognosis is explained in part by the development of leptomeningeal metastasis late in the course of cancer, in part
by the acquired resistance of recurrent cancers to therapy,
and in part by technical limitations affecting drug selection and delivery to the leptomeningeal space. Craniospinal irradiation is poorly tolerated in this group of (often
heavily pretreated) patients, and only a few chemotherapeutic and biologic agents can be administered safely into
the CSF. In addition, the efficacy of most of these agents
is compromised by a short half-life within the CSF and a
cell cycle phase-specific mechanism of action.16 Even an
ideal chemotherapeutic agent, with a prolonged half-life
and a non-cell cycle-specific mechanism of action, must
overcome the substantial challenge of inadequate drug
distribution within the leptomeningeal space. Even when
CSF flow is unimpeded, the normal CSF circulation carries fluid preferentially to the ventricles.17-19 As a result,
the delivery of drug administered into the lumbar intrathecal space is unlikely to achieve clinically relevant drug

1950

concentrations within the cerebral ventricles, where malignant cells are known to reside.20-22,24,30-34 This may
explain the observation made in the first randomized controlled trial in this disease that survival may be better in
patients who receive intraventricular, in contrast to intralumbar, chemotherapy.2 Although this observation is
intuitively obvious, no randomized controlled trial has
allowed a more rigorous assessment of this hypothesis.
In the current study, 2 types of intra-CSF chemotherapy were compared: a sustained-release formulation
of cytarabine and a conventional (relatively short CSF
half-life) formulation of methotrexate.7 Overall, patients
treated with sustained-release cytarabine showed no difference in PFS compared with those treated with methotrexate. Similarly, there was no difference in PFS among
patients receiving sustained-release cytarabine, whether
that drug was administered into the ventricle (through a
ventricular access device) or into the lumbar space (by
lumbar puncture). In contrast, those patients who
received methotrexate into the ventricle demonstrated a
statistically significant PFS advantage over those patients
who received methotrexate into the lumbar space (43 vs
19 days, P ¼ .048). One explanation for this finding is
that the transit of short half-life chemotherapeutic agents
within the CSF is too brief to allow for adequate back diffusion into the ventricles. In contrast, long half-life medications have the potential to remain within the CSF
sufficiently long to allow for cytotoxic concentrations of
drug to develop within the ventricle by diffusion, despite

the bulk flow of CSF out of the ventricle. Because malignant cells often accumulate in the ventricles, short half-life
agents administered by the lumbar route do not
adequately treat malignant cells residing in the ventricle.30-34 Pharmacokinetic studies appear to support this
hypothesis. Methotrexate administered by lumbar puncture does, in fact, fail to produce sustained cytotoxic drug
concentrations in ventricular CSF in nearly 1=3 of patients,
whereas methotrexate administered into the ventricle
achieves cytotoxic drug concentrations at both rostral and
caudal ends of the neuraxis.20-22,24 In contrast, pharmacokinetic studies using sustained-release cytarabine have
shown that cytotoxic concentrations are achieved in both
the ventricles and the lumbar sac regardless of the site of
administration.23
Our analysis has several limitations, including the
retrospective study design, subgroup analysis, and comparatively small sample size. In addition, CSF flow before
treatment was not ascertained in all patients by radioisotope CSF flow studies, and consequently patency of CSF
corridors was not known.18,19 The majority of patients
had CSF flow assessed by MRI that can only assess
whether hydrocephalus is present or absent. Patients were
eligible for entry into trial with either positive CSF cytology or with neuraxis MRI-consistent neoplastic meningitis. In the subgroup retrospective analysis, imbalance may
have occurred with respect to presence or absence of bulky
neuroradiographic disease that has clear prognostic implications. Lastly, randomization was performed with respect
to treatment allocation, not site of intra-CSF chemotherapy administration. Consequently, the decision as to site
of intra-CSF chemotherapy administration was determined by the treating physician’s preference, leading
potentially to imbalance in relevant prognostic variables.
One implication of this analysis is that optimal therapy of patients with solid tumor neoplastic meningitis
requires intraventricular administration of all chemotherapeutic agents with a short half-life. This restriction on
the site of administration does not appear to apply when a
sustained-release (ie, long half-life) chemotherapeutic
agent is used. A less obvious and potentially more farreaching implication pertains to the use of intra-CSF
chemotherapy in the setting of CNS prophylaxis (for
example, in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and highrisk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Currently these
patients are treated almost exclusively through the lumbar
route. This study suggests that these patients should either
be treated intraventricularly, or if treated by the lumbar

Cancer

route, should receive a sustained-release medication.
These conclusions are based on an unplanned, retrospective analysis of the current study and therefore require
prospective confirmation. Nevertheless, we believe these
findings are compelling enough to suggest a reconsideration of the current treatment practices with respect to
intra-CSF drug therapy. In the future, this same rationale
might be extended to patients with solid tumors in which
CSF metastases are common and intra-CSF chemotherapy may be an up-front adjunct therapy (medulloblastoma and primary CNS lymphoma, for example). Future
research should be directed at developing additional and
more effective sustained-release chemotherapeutic agents
suitable for intra-CSF administration.
