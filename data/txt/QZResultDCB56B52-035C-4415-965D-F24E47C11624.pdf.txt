The purpose of this review was to determine whether imatinib mesylate (STI571,
Gleevec) has a role in the treatment of osteosarcoma. The expression of plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and its ligand was examined in a panel of
surgical specimens obtained from 54 osteosarcoma patients, and then the expression was compared with prognosis. The effects of imatinib mesylate on growth
and molecular events in 10 patient-derived osteosarcoma cell cultures were
investigated. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated frequent expression of
PDGF-AA (80.4%) and PDGF-a receptor (79.6%) and their correlation with inferior event-free survival (P < .05). PDGF-B–B and PDGF-b–receptor expressions
were also frequent (75.4% and 86%, respectively); however, statistically significant
inferior event-free survival was not demonstrated (P 5 .15). In vitro studies
demonstrated that imatinib mesylate had a variable cytotoxic effect on various
osteosarcoma primary cultures, with an IC50 of 5.6 lM to 9.5 lM, and blocked

steosarcoma accounts for only 1% or so of cancers in the
United States,1 yet it is the most common primary malignant
bone tumor diagnosed annually in children and young adults. The
current treatment regimen, originally developed in the mid-1980s,
significantly increases 5-year disease-free survival of nonmetastatic
osteosarcoma patients to approximately 70%. Efforts during the past
decade to increase survival by intensifying the treatment regimen
with standard chemotherapeutic agents have been unsuccessful.
Furthermore, patients with unresectable primary tumors or those
with clinically evident metastases continue to have poor prognoses
despite aggressive surgery and chemotherapy.2–4 Thus, more effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these poor-prognosis tumors are needed.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and its receptor are known to have a role in pathogenesis,
invasion, and distant metastasis of many human
solid tumors. The expression of PDGF/PDGF receptor in a variety of human solid tumors, including
Ewing sarcoma, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and
chondrosarcoma, is correlated with poor prognosis
and metastasis.5–8 Recent studies have suggested
PDGF involvement in an autocrine or paracrine loop
that causes tumor growth and progression in osteosarcoma.9 Although PDGF is known to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and
osteoclasts,10 its role in osteosarcoma, specifically
PDGF ligands and their receptors, is poorly understood.
Imatinib mesylate (STI-571, Gleevec), a tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, was developed to inhibit the Abl
protein kinase. Initially approved for treating patients
with chronic myelogenous leukemia,11 where the Abl
protein kinase is activated by a 9:22 chromosomal
translocation (Bcr/Abl),12,13 imatinib mesylate has
subsequently been shown to be effective in treating
metastatic or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal
tumor. Studies are underway for its use in treating
prostate cancer and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.14,15 These studies are being conducted because,
in addition to inhibiting Abl protein kinase, imatinib
mesylate has been shown to inhibit the PDGF receptor and c-Kit tyrosine kinases but not to affect other
closely related protein kinases.11,16 These findings led
to this study of the potential relevance of imatinib
mesylate in the treatment of osteosarcoma.
By exploring the effects of imatinib mesylate on
growth and downstream signaling pathways in
patient-derived osteosarcoma cultures, the current
study aimed to identify the expression and apparent
involvement of PDGF receptor in the prognosis of osteosarcoma and to determine whether patients with
osteosarcoma may be potential candidates for imatinib mesylate therapy.

prised of these agents and ifosfamide and/or muramyl tripeptide.17 Written informed consent was
obtained for participation in this study from all
patients or their guardians according to a biology
study approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Hospital. All samples were reviewed to confirm a diagnosis
of high-grade osteosarcoma, and histologic necrosis
after induction chemotherapy was determined
according to the Huvos grading system described
previously.18 Each case was defined as a good responder (grades 3 and 4) or standard responder
(grades 1 and 2) by using previous definitions.17
Event-free survival was defined as the interval from
diagnosis to relapse, death, or last follow-up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Tissue Microarray Construction and
Immunohistochemistry
From defined morphologic areas in formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tumor samples, core biopsies
were taken with a precision instrument (Beecher
Instruments, Silver Spring, Md). Tissue cores with a
dimension of 1 mm were punched and arrayed on a
recipient paraffin block and then 5 lm sections of
the tissue-array block were cut and placed on
charged polylysine-coated slides. The sections were
deparaffinized, dehydrated in graded alcohols, and
immunostained by using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method as previously described.19 Anti–
PDGF-A and B antibodies and anti–PDGF-a and b
receptor antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, Calif) were used at a dilution of 1:500 and
1:300, respectively. Nonspecific reactivity was
assessed by omission of the primary antibody, and
the specificity was confirmed in tumor section as
well as in control tissue by preabsorption of the antisera with blocking peptide supplied by the manufacturer. Endogenous mast cells were used as internal
positive controls. Each sample was evaluated by a
pathologist blinded to patient identity. The samples
were classified as negative (no staining), weakly positive (1% to 25% cells positive), and strongly positive
(26% to 100% cells positive).

Patients
Osteosarcoma patients whose surgical specimens
were obtained at the time of biopsy, definitive surgery, or both at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center between 1992 and 2000 were entered into this
study. All patients received neoadjuvant and adjuvant
chemotherapy on or in accordance with the Children’s Cancer Group CCG-7921/Pediatric Oncology
Group POG-9351 protocol. This protocol included
regimen A comprised of high-dose methotrexate,
doxorubicin, and cisplatin. Regimen B was com-

Cell Culture and Reagents
Ten surgical specimens were obtained from 10 different osteosarcoma patients treated at multiple sites,
and primary cell cultures (OS252, C223, C202, C229,
OS145, OS160, OS187, OS272, OS273, and OS284)
were generated by standard collagenase disaggregation of tissues. All isolated cells were cultured in
Eagle minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 378C. All

in vitro studies were completed within 20 passages.
NIH/3T3 cells and 143B cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va)
and were maintained in the suggested media and
additives. Imatinib mesylate was purchased from
Novartis Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland) and
stored in a 10 mM stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 2808C.

Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting
Primary cultures were lysed in cold-modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM
Tris; pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.1% SDS;
1% NP-40; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 lg/mL aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin; 1 mM Na3VO4; and 1 mM NaF).
Proteins were quantified by using a protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif). 25 lg of proteins were
separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
under reducing conditions and electrophoretically
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. After
blocking in Tris-buffered saline, containing 0.1%
Tween-20 and 5% nonfat dry milk, at room temperature for 1 hour, membranes were immunoblotted with
anti-PDGF receptor a and receptor b antibodies
(1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass)
overnight on the shaker at 48C. Then blots were
washed in tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween20 at room temperature to remove the primary antibody and incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Bound
antibodies were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).
Cells were grown to 70% confluence in MEM-a
media with 20% FCS. After washing twice with PBS,
media were replaced with Delbecco Modification of
Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 0.1% (W/V) bovine serum albumin (BSA). After 24 hours, cells were
pretreated for 90 minutes with the indicated concentrations of imatinib mesylate, followed by stimulation
with 100 ng/mL PDGF- AA (Chemicon/Millipore,
Temecula, Calif) or PDGF-BB (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif ) for 10 minutes. For detection of phosphorylated PDGF-a receptor, proteins
were, then, extracted and quantified as described
above and analyzed by Western blotting by using
antiphospho–PDGF-a receptor antibody (1:500; Cell
Signaling Technology). For detection of phosphorylated PDGF-b receptor, whole-cell lysates containing
500 lg of protein were immunoprecipitated with 4
lg of anti–PDGF-b receptor antibodies overnight at
48C. The immunocomplexes were harvested with the
addition of Pansorbin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif)
and subjected to Western blotting with antiphospho-

2121

tyrosine antibodies (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology).
Cell lysates were also analyzed by Western blotting
with antiphospho-Akt antibody, or antiphospho–
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) antibody
(1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology). For loading control, membranes were incubated in stripping buffer
(62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mM bmecaptoethanol) with constant shaking at 508C for
45 minutes and reprobed with anti–PDGF-a, anti–
PDGF-b receptor, anti-Akt or anti-MAPK antibodies
(1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology).

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted by using Rneasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, Calif ) from a panel of patientderived primary osteosarcoma cell cultures, standard
osteosarcoma cell lines, and osteosarcoma xenografts, and subsequently reverse transcribed into
cDNA by using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis
System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. Gene expression quantitation, in RNA samples converted to cDNA for both
PDGF-a and b receptors, was carried out by using a
7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System and Taqman Gene
Expression assay mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, Calif; Assay ID: Hs00183486_m1 for PDGFR-a
and Hs00182163_m1 for PDGFR-b). Briefly, 5 lL of
diluted cDNA was added to 10 lL Master Mix (1
3 Taqman Buffer A, 3.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 200 umol/L
dNTPs, 0.025 unit/uL Taq polymerase; Applied Biosystems), 900 nM each forward and reverse primers,
and 250 nM probe. Thermal cycling was performed
in a reaction volume of 20 lL with a denaturation
step of 958C for 10 minites, followed by 40 cycles of
958C at 15seconds, and 1minute at annealing temperature, 608C. The housekeeping gene GAPDH was
used as an endogenous control to normalize each
sample for its mRNA content, and multiple wells of
nontemplate control were included on each PCR 96well plate as negative controls. Reactions for each
sample were performed in triplicate for the target
genes and GAPDH, respectively. Sample mRNA levels
were relatively quantified by using the D DCT method
as described in the 7500 Sequence Detection System
manual (Applied Biosystems).
Cytotoxicity Assay
Cells were grown in their respective media in 96-well
culture plates (4000 cells/well) and allowed to adhere
overnight. Cells were washed twice with PBS and serum starved for 24 hours. Cells were, then, incubated
for 30 minutes with imatinib mesylate in the indicated concentrations before stimulation with 10 ng/

mL PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB for 48 hours. Viable cell
amount was quantified by the colorimetric XTT
reduction assay. Briefly, 1 mg/mL XTT (Polysciences,
Warrington, Pa) with 25 lM phenazine methosulfate
were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for another 4 hours. The absorbance was
measured at 450 nm (reference wavelength 690 nm)
by using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments,
Winooski, Vt).

Statistical Analysis
Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier
analysis, and statistical significance was evaluated by
the log-rank test. A Fisher exact test was used
to determine the correlation with histologic necrosis
after induction chemotherapy between patients with
and without PDGF and PDGF-receptor expression.

RESULTS
Coexpression of PDGF-A and PDGF-a Receptor, but Not
PDGF-B and PDGF-b Receptor, Correlates With a Worse
Prognosis in Osteosarcoma
Fifty-four patient samples were analyzed for PDGF-A
and PDGF-a receptor expression. Initial biopsy material was analyzed from 19 patients, tissue from definitive surgery was analyzed from 29 patients, and
both were analyzed from 6 patients. Table 1 lists the
clinicopathologic characteristics for these patients.
The 5-year event-free survival was 66.8% (Fig. 2A).
Forty-one of 51 (80.4%) patients expressed PDGF-A
with 18 patients (35.3%) strongly expressing the protein, whereas 39 of 49 (79.6%) patients expressed
PDGF-a receptor with 15 (30.6%) patients strongly
expressing the protein. Coexpression of PDGF-A and
PDGF-a receptors occurred in 37 of 49 (75.5%)
patients. A representative tissue microarray construct
and a representative immunostain of PDGF-A are
shown in Figure 1. Expression of PDGF-A, PDGF-a
receptor, and their coexpression correlated significantly with a shorter event-free survival (P  .05, .01,
and .01, respectively) (Fig. 2B). There was no significant correlation between PDGF-AA expression or
PDGF-a receptor expression and histologic necrosis
after induction chemotherapy. This can be explained
because the majority of enrolled patients had a good
histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy,
thus limiting the statistical power (Table 1).
Unlike with PDGF-A and PDGF-a receptor, no
significant event-free survival correlation was found
with PDGF-B and PDGF-b receptor expression,
expressed alone or coexpressed (P  .30, .41, .15,
respectively; data not shown).

Molecular Effects on the PDGF Signaling Cascade
of Imatinib Mesylate
Of 10 primary cell cultures tested, OS160, OS284,
C202, C223, and C229 expressed detectable levels of
both isoforms of PDGF receptors; OS272 and OS273
expressed only PDGF-b receptor; OS252 expressed
only a receptor; and OS145 and OS187 (M187) did
not express either receptor by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 3). 143B, a standard osteosarcoma cell line,
expressed both isoforms of receptors but at very low
levels (Fig. 3). These results also confirmed results
obtained from quantitative RT-PCR, in which gene
expression was quantitated at the mRNA level (data
not shown). To determine whether imatinib mesylate
can block PDGF signaling cascades and which downstream pathways are affected in osteosarcoma, the
inhibitory effects of imatinib mesylate on PDGFmediated phosphorylation of PDGF receptor as well
as Akt and MAPK were studied in primary osteosarcoma cultures. PDGF-a and b receptors were phosphorylated in response to PDGF-BB stimulation, and
phosphorylation was inhibited by 0.1 lM to 1 lM
imatinib mesylate in all 4 PDGF receptor-expressing
osteosarcoma lines (OS160, OS284, OS272, OS273;
Fig. 4A). Similarly, PDGF-a receptor was phosphorylated in response to PDGF-AA stimulation, and phosphorylation was inhibited by 1 lM to 10 lM imatinib

mesylate in all 3 PDGF-a receptor-expressing osteosarcoma cell lines (C223, C202, C229), but at 0.1 lM
to 1 lM in OS252, which expressed only a receptor
(Fig. 4B). There is no phosphorylation of PDGF-b
receptor upon PDGF-AA stimulation of these cell
lines (data not shown). However, Akt was phosphorylated by both PDGF-AA and BB, and 1 lM to
10 lM imatinib mesylate inhibited this phosphorylation in all of the PDGF receptor-expressing cell lines
(Fig. 5) for both isoforms. In contrast, MAPK
was constitutively activated despite PDGF stimulation even in the presence of 10 lM imatinib mesylate
treatment in 7 osteosarcoma primary cultures,

OS145, OS272, OS273, OS284, C223, C202, and C229.
In only 2 osteosarcoma cultures, OS160, which expressed both isoforms of PDGF receptor, and OS252,
which expressed only a receptor, MAPK was phosphorylated in response to PDGF and suppressed by
10 lM imatinib mesylate to some extent (Fig. 6).

worse survival is observed in patients coexpressing PDGF-AA and PDGF-a

50 lM, cytotoxic effects of imatinib mesylate
occurred in all osteosarcoma lines (Fig. 7). IC50
values for PDGF receptor-expressing osteosarcoma
lines were 5.6 lM to 9.5 lM, which were significantly
lower than those (25.4 lM to 30.1 lM) for PDGF receptor-negative osteosarcoma lines (P < .01). There
was no significant difference in IC50 values between
osteosarcoma lines expressing both isoforms and
PDGF-b receptor only.

DISCUSSION
Very few studies have been published on the involvement of PDGF receptor, particularly on PDGF-a re-

ceptor, in osteosarcoma. One of the prior
immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that of
37 cases of osteosarcoma, 38% showed PDGF and
PDGFR expression, with 11 (30%) cases having
expression of both, and correlation of PDGF-positive
tumors with higher proliferation (MIB-1 index) compared with PDGF-negative tumors.20 Another previous immunohistochemical study also demonstrated
that 23 osteosarcoma specimens all expressed both
PDGF-A and PDGF-a receptor with 52% and 43%
staining strongly positive (>25% of the cells stained),
respectively.9 Neither of the above studies related
these findings to clinical characteristics. However, a
recent study by Sulzbacher et al.21 correlated the immunohistochemical findings with clinical characteristics and outcomes. Analyzing 57 patient samples,
they found that high levels of PDGF-AA expression
were associated with a significantly lower 5-year disease-free survival compared with low-level expression of PDGF-AA (21.22% vs 42.72%). PDGF-a
receptor expression, although exhibiting a similar
trend, failed to achieve significance. In this current
study, the frequent expression of PDGF-a receptor
(79.6%) and ligand (80.4%), or both (75%), in osteosarcoma and their correlation with inferior event-free
survival (P < .05, 0.01, and 0.01, respectively) were
demonstrated, which confirmed the study by Sulzbacher et al. who found correlation of PDGF-AA expression and inferior disease-free survival. Whereas that
study only found a significant difference in eventfree survival with PDGF-AA and a trend toward significance with PDGF-a–receptor expression, this current study has demonstrated statistically significant
differences in event-free survival with both markers
expressed individually as well as together. Based on
these findings, we suggest that PDGF-AA and PDGFa–receptor expression may be prognostic in osteosarcoma and worthy of further prospective study.
Although expression correlated with event-free
survival, it did not correlate with chemotherapy
response as assessed by degree of necrosis after
induction chemotherapy. This may suggest that the
association with outcome is related to tumor properties other than chemotherapy response, with metastatic behavior being an example. These properties
were not investigated in vitro in this current particular study. It must also be acknowledged that the high
proportion of good responders included in our sample set provided limited statistical power to identify
an association, and, therefore, a relation between
PDGF expression and chemotherapy response cannot
be definitively excluded. It should also be highlighted
that other studies have failed to demonstrate a relation with histologic response while predicting sur-

FIGURE 3. Western blot analysis of PDGF-a and PDGF-b receptor expression in primary osteosarcoma cultures are compared. C229, OS160, and OS284
expressed detectable levels of both isoforms of PDGF receptors; C223 and C202 expressed more PDGF-b receptor than PDGF-a receptor, OS252 expressed
only PDGF-a receptor, OS272 and OS273 expressed only PDGF-b receptor, and 143B, OS145, and OS187 (M187) did not express either PDGF receptor. A positive control with NIH/3T3 cells is shown.

vival even in the context of chemotherapy resistance
determinants such as p-glycoprotein.22 Some have
attributed this to a relation of the gene being studied
with only a subset of the drugs used in the multiagent chemotherapy treatment of osteosarcoma.
Although neither PDGF-BB nor PDGF-b–receptor
expression correlated with statistically significant inferior event-free survival, both trended toward significance. This trend was further enhanced when
coexpression of both markers was examined, but
this, too, failed to achieve significance. As PDGF-BB
is a ligand for the a receptor in addition to the b receptor, it may also serve as a significant prognostic
marker in conjunction with PDGF-a receptor. Moreover, upon PDGF-BB stimulation, 2 osteosarcoma
cell lines (OS160 and OS284) showed phosphorylation of PDGF-a receptor in addition to PDGF-b re-

ceptor, and dephosphorylation by 0.1 lM to 1 lM
imatinib mesylate, which, in turn, led to downstream
deactivation of Akt. In addition, the antiproliferative
activity of imatinib mesylate on osteosarcoma primary cultures was shown to be the same after
PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB stimulations. These findings
further support the role of PDGF-BB as a significant
prognostic marker in conjunction with PDGF-a
receptor.
In imatinib mesylate-responsive chronic myelogenous leukemia cells or other tumor cells, imatinib
mesylate inhibited both Akt and MAPK phosphorylation.23–25 McGary et al.26 reported that in standard
osteosarcoma cell lines, 1 lM imatinib mesylate
inhibited phosphorylation of both PDGF-mediated
MAPK and Akt, and PDGF-mediated cell growth with
an IC50 of approximately 1 lM. Concordant with

PDGF-b receptor (p-bR) and p-aR were inhibited by 1 lM imatinib mesylate in both receptor-positive and only b receptor-positive cell lines. 143B and M187,
both isoform-negative cell lines, showed no phosphorylation. Anti–PDGF-a receptor antibodies (aR), anti–PDGF-b receptor antibodies (bR) were used to verify
the equal amount of protein loaded. Each experiment was performed in duplicate with equivalent results.

their findings, in our study by using low-passage
patient-derived primary osteosarcoma cell cultures,
we showed that imatinib mesylate influenced the
PDGF-BB mediated intracellular signal transduction
in osteosarcoma cells as evidenced by its inhibition
through Akt phosphorylation. In contrast to prior
results, 8 of 10 primary osteosarcoma cultures had
constitutive activation of MAPK, and this was not
affected by imatinib mesylate. Only in 2 osteosarcoma cell lines (OS160 and OS252) partial, not complete, MAPK phosphorylation inhibition was
observed with 10 lM imatinib mesylate. Constitutive
MAPK activation of primary osteosarcoma cultures
may, in part, explain our result that imatinib mesylate required a high concentration to have marked
effects on cell viability, particularly when compared
with studies in other histotypes. Constitutive activation of MAPK has been reported in a variety of other
human tumor cell lines.27 Taken together, the con-

centration of imatinib required for cytotoxicity and
pathway inhibition suggests imatinib will not be
active in the treatment of osteosarcoma at conventional doses. Moreover, a recent phase II study of
imatinib mesylate, by the Children’s Oncology Group,
demonstrated little or no activity of imatinib mesylate as a single agent in children with relapsed or
refractory solid tumors, including osteosarcoma.28
Potentially, this approach may be of value in predicting a clinical response from osteosarcoma patients.
Imatinib mesylate inhibited PDGF-mediated cell
growth in all PDGF receptor-expressing osteosarcoma
lines with an IC50 of 5.6 lM to 9.5 lM. However,
these IC50 values are much higher than those for
chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines with Bcr/
Abl fusion, which are at the submicromolar level.1,29
These IC50 values for the growth inhibition of osteosarcoma cells are higher than the potentially achievable serum concentration (4.6 lM) by once-daily

FIGURE 5. The effects of imatinib mesylate on PDGF signaling molecules were analyzed by immunoblotting by using a (A) PDGF-BB ligand, and (B) PDGF-AA
ligand. Phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) were inhibited by 1–10 lM imatinib mesylate. Anti-Akt antibodies (Akt) were used to verify the equal amount of protein
loaded. Each experiment was performed in duplicate with equivalent results.

administration of 400 mg of imatinib mesylate, based
on the pharmacokinetics obtained from the clinical
trial for chronic myelogenous leukemia patients.30
Other studies to examine the in vitro antiproliferative
function of imatinib mesylate have shown that the
IC50 for small-cell lung-carcinoma cell lines with cKit expression and glioblastoma cell lines expressing
both PDGF and PDGF receptor were 1 lM to 5 lM
and 3 lM, respectively.25,31,32 PDGF receptor does
not appear to be as central to proliferation for osteosarcoma cultures as Bcr/Abl is for chronic myelogenous leukemia. More recent studies have indicated
that doses of imatinib mesylate can be doubled to
increase the efficacy of treatment without significantly increasing toxic effects.33,34 Greater efficacy
may be expected when imatinib mesylate is used at
higher doses than currently used or in combination
with other chemotherapeutic agents or other tyrosine
kinase inhibitors. It is possible that at these concentrations, imatinib may not be achieving cytotoxicity
through inhibition of PDGF activation.
Although PDGF expression is not central to osteosarcoma pathogenesis, hence its lack of utility as
a therapeutic target, it may be prognostic. Something
that is essential for pathogenesis is unlikely to be
prognostic, as it will be uniformly present and, there-

fore, cannot discriminate among prognostic subgroups. The molecular basis through which PDGF
has a prognostic association remains elusive. It
remains unknown what function is served by the
expression of PDGF in the context of osteosarcoma,
particularly given the multitude of redundant signaling pathways in osteosarcoma. Essential will be replication of these results in a prospective study that
demonstrates PDGF expression’s prognostic value in
osteosarcoma.
In summary, PDGF was prognostic and did
express, but these findings did not relate to imatinib
response, which was an unexpected finding. The lack
of response to imatinib mesylate may, in part, be
related to its inability to inactivate signaling pathways such as MAPK, which may be supporting tumor
proliferation. These model systems accurately predict
the clinical response of osteosarcoma patients when
they are treated with imatinib mesylate. Prospective
validation of the prognostic value of PDGF expression is warranted. Future studies will comprehensively assess receptors and their intracellular
signaling pathways in osteosarcoma tumor specimens to better understand their respective roles.
This may begin to decipher the roles of the many
redundant autostimulatory pathways in osteosar-

FIGURE 7. Imatinib mesylate reduced the PDGF-mediated cell growth rate
in PDGF receptor-expressing osteosarcoma cultures (OS160, OS272, OS273,
and OS284) in comparison to PDGF receptor-negative osteosarcoma cultures
(OS145 and OS187). At a concentration of 50 lM, cytotoxic effects of imatinib mesylate occurred in all osteosarcoma cultures in the colorimetric XTT
