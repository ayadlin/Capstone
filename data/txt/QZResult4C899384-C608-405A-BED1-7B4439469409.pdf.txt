ABSTRACT
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of death from cancer
worldwide. Melatonin, an indoleamine discovered in the pineal gland, exerts pleiotropic
anticancer effects against a variety of cancer types. In particular, melatonin may
be an important anticancer drug in the treatment of NSCLC. Herein, we review the
correlation between the disruption of the melatonin rhythm and NSCLC incidence;
we also evaluate the evidence related to the effects of melatonin in inhibiting lung
carcinogenesis. Special focus is placed on the oncostatic effects of melatonin, including
anti-proliferation, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of invasion and metastasis, and
enhancement of immunomodulation. We suggest the drug synergy of melatonin
with radio- or chemotherapy for NSCLC could prove to be useful. Taken together,
the information complied herein may serve as a comprehensive reference for the
anticancer mechanisms of melatonin against NSCLC, and may be helpful for the design
of future experimental research and for advancing melatonin as a therapeutic agent
for NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

treatments to prolong the survival of NSCLC patients,
but improvements are marginally effective [4]. Moreover,
radio- or chemotherapies often lead to undesirable side
effects on normal cells or tissues, which limits their use
as a treatment for cancer [5]. Thus, a number of studies
were devoted to overcoming the deleterious effects and
enhancing the efficacy of these treatments when given
in combination with the appropriate supplement such
as melatonin, which is well known lack of toxic and

Lung cancer, which accounts for about 13% of
total cancer diagnoses, is the most frequently diagnosed
cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males
and females [1]. More than 85% of lung cancer cases are
classified as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [2], of
which the predicted 5-year survival rate is only 15.9%
[3]. Surgery and chemoradiotherapy are the two major

undesirable side effects [5-8].
Melatonin
(N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine)
is an indoleamine produced by the pineal gland that
modulates the human circadian rhythms and acts as a
neuromodulator, cytokine, biological response modifier
and antioxidant [9, 10]. As a potent free radical scavenger
and antioxidant, melatonin has the capacity to scavenge
up to 10 reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the cascade
reaction means, which distinguishes melatonin from
the classic antioxidants that scavenge only one or less
ROS [11-13]. Additionally, numerous publications
have reported that melatonin inhibits the growth of
a variety of cancers: lung [5, 14, 15], breast [16-20],
prostate [21-24], liver [25, 26], colon [27, 28], etc. The
oncostatic mechanisms of melatonin are related to several
hallmarks of cancer, including anti-proliferation [14],
induction of apoptosis [5, 14, 15], inhibition of invasion
and metastasis [29, 30], anti-angiogenesis [16, 31], and
enhancement of immunomodulation [32] among others.
Furthermore, clinical studies have demonstrated that
melatonin treatment enhances the efficacy and reduces
the side-effects of chemotherapy, prolongs survival time,
and improves quality of life for NSCLC patients [8, 33].
Accordingly, these findings attest to melatonin being a
potential anticancer drug in the treatment of NSCLC and
provide an inducement for further work in this area.
In this review, we focus on the therapeutic actions

of melatonin as a treatment for NSCLC. First, consider the
correlation between melatonin disruption and its impact
on NSCLC incidence, and the anticarcinogenic effects of
melatonin against lung cancer. We then describe in-depth
the oncostatic effects of melatonin and the drug synergy
of melatonin for NSCLC treatments. Finally, we discuss
several novel potential directions for future research in
this area. The information complied herein may serve as
a comprehensive reference for the anticancer mechanisms
of melatonin against NSCLC, and may be helpful for the
design of future experimental research and for advancing
melatonin as a therapeutic agent for NSCLC.

MELATONIN DISRUPTION AND NSCLC
Melatonin, the “chemical expression of darkness”
[34], is an important component of the body’s internal
time-keeping system [35]. However, light exposure by
artificial illumination at night suppresses human melatonin
levels and disrupts circadian rhythmicity (mechanisms
are illustrated in Figure 1) [36, 37]. Under controlled
laboratory conditions, retinal exposure to illuminances as
low as 1 lux or less of monochromatic light at wavelengths
of 440 to 460 (blue-appearing light) signiﬁcantly lowers
nocturnal melatonin levels [38-40], as does < 100 lux of
broad spectrum ﬂuorescent light [41-44]. Disturbances

in melatonin circadian rhythm result in chronodisruption
which is associated with many health disorders including
heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer
[11, 45]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that
melatonin disruption would increase the risk of cancers,
including breast cancer [46-48], prostate cancer [49, 50],
and colon cancer [50, 51], etc. Additionally, melatonin
disruption also can increase the risk of NSCLC (Table
1). Parent et al. [50] reported that men who ever worked
at night anytime as an adult have higher risk for lung
cancer, with excesses apparent across all main histologic
subtypes. Advanced NSCLC patients suffered from poor
sleep quality and disrupted circadian function [52]. Data
have revealed that melatonin levels are lower in NSCLC
patients regardless of TNM stages [53]. Moreover, Hu et
al. [54] demonstrated that melatonin and its metabolite,
6-sulfatoxymelatonin, are significantly lower in NSCLC
patients with standard chemotherapy.
Collectively, the published literature suggested
that melatonin disruption increases the risk of NSCLC.
The mechanism involved, however, warrant further
investigation. It is possible that melatonin anticarcinogenic
actions may account for the increased incidence of
NSCLC. This will be discussed later in this review.

the lung carcinogenesis induced by urethane in A/J and
SHR/u mice. When compared with the urethane-treated
animals, melatonin treatment also significantly lowered
concentration of serum malondialdehyde (MDA), an index
of the lipid peroxidation (LPO), this indicated a potential
role of melatonin as an antioxidant in relation to its cancer
inhibiting actions [55, 63].
Cigarette smoke exposure, both active and passive,
is a major epidemiologically proven cause of lung cancer;
this accounts for about 90% of lung cancer incidence [64].
In the gaseous and particulate phases, cigarette smoke
contains more than 4,500 components, including direct
carcinogens (e.g., methylcholanthrene, benzo-α-pyrenes
and acrolein), toxins (e.g., carbon monoxide and nicotine),
reactive solids with chemically catalytic surfaces, and
oxidants (e.g., superoxide and nitrogen oxides) [65, 66].
Additionally, cigarette smoke is also considered as a
critically-important risk factor in the development of
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), which
is another key risk factor for lung cancer [64, 66]. Active
smoking decreases human blood melatonin levels [67],
while melatonin treatment attenuates cigarette smokeinduced pulmonary diseases and lung cancer mainly by
three potential mechanisms (see Figure 2). First, melatonin
may be useful in reducing lung tissue injury caused by
smoke-related toxins (e.g., nicotine) [68, 69]. Furthermore,
melatonin may decrease pulmonary inflammation induced
as a consequence of smoking [70]. In cigarette smoke
exposed mice, Shin et al. [71] reported that melatonin
significantly reduced neutrophils counts, suppressed
proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6),
and decreased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and
myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression in lung tissue. As an
effective antioxidant, melatonin inhibition of oxidative

Melatonin is an experimentally documented
anticarcinogen against a number of cancers [55]. Previous
animal studies have demonstrated that melatonin inhibits
different chemical mutagen-induced carcinogenesis

cervix and vagina [62]. Moreover, melatonin limits

gland from producing melatonin and; conversely, melatonin production and secretion is increased during the dark period.

stress induced by smoke is a potentially important
protective means by which it reduces lung damage. In
the lung tissue of smoke-treated animals, melatonin
significantly reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
LPO production, and upregulated glutathione (GSH) and
superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity [68, 71]. Thus, the
likelihood is high that melatonin reduces respiratory DNA
damage caused by ROS, thereby inhibiting carcinogenesis
[72]. The collective evidence suggests that melatonin
should be considered a worthy agent for inhibition of lung
cancer.

cancer [73]. Apoptosis is a well-known mechanism
of programmed cell death that does not injure normal
neighboring cells and reduces local inflammation [74].
Since programmed cell death by apoptosis serves as a
natural barrier to cancer development [73], apoptotic
induction is an important mechanism initiated by
chemotherapeutic agents [5]. Melatonin exerts antiapoptotic effects in normal cells exposed to toxic agents
or metabolic injury. However, melatonin usually has the
opposite effect on cancer cells and induces apoptosis in
a wide range of different tumors (e.g., breast, prostate,
cervix, liver, colon, pancreas, kidney, neuro) [18, 20, 24,
25, 28, 75-78]; thus, the induction of apoptosis of cancer
cells (but not of normal cells) is one of the mechanisms
by which melatonin limits tumor growth [61, 79-88]. This
specifically relates to lung cancer given that melatonin

treatment dose- and time- dependent decreased the
viability of human A549 and PC9 lung adenocarcinoma
cells, and increased their apoptotic index. Furthermore,
melatonin treatment significantly upregulated the
expression of Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), p53
upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and ROS,
enhanced the caspase 3 activity, and downregulated
the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and GSH levels via the
inhibition of histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1) signaling
pathway in adenocarcinoma cells [14] (Figure 3A).
Moreover, Plaimee et al. [15, 30] have demonstrated that
melatonin induces apoptosis in SK-LU-1 human lung
adenocarcinoma cells. In combination with cisplatin,
melatonin can potentiates cisplatin-induced apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest in the S phase [5]. Thus, it is evident that
melatonin can induce NSCLC cell apoptosis, making it
potentially useful as an NSCLC treatment especially in
combination with chemotherapeutic agents [74, 75].

the new site [93, 96]. Several reports have suggested
that melatonin inhibits NSCLC metastasis. In the
pinealectomized mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma,
melatonin treatment leads to significant decrement of in
metastatic volume [32]. Furthermore, Zhou et al. [29]
reported that Melatonin significantly inhibits the migration
of A549 cells; this may be associated with the downregulation of the expression of osteopontin (OPN), myosin
light chain kinase (MLCK), phosphorylation of myosin
light chain (MLC), and up-regulation of the expression
of occludin via the inhibition of c-jun-N-terminal kinases
(JNK) signaling pathway (Figure 3C). Accordingly,
melatonin has the potential to reduce the malignancy of
NSCLC through the inhibition of cancer cells metastasis
and progression. This would be consistent with a large
number of reports showing that melatonin inhibits the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastases of a
variety of cancer cell types [17, 97, 98]. Rho-associated
kinase and its isoforms (ROCK-1 and ROCK-2) promote
cancer invasion and migration by regulating actin
rearrangements in the cytoskeleton [99]. A recent study
by Borin et al. [17] reported that melatonin was effective
in controlling metastatic breast cancer in vitro and in vivo,
not only via suppression of the proliferation of cancer
cells but also through suppression of cancer metastasis by
ROCK-1 inhibition. Whether melatonin treatment inhibits
NSCLC metastasis through antagonism of the ROCK
pathway warrants further investigation.

EFFECT OF MELATONIN ON NSCLC
CELL PROLIFERATION
Arguably the most fundamental trait of cancer cells
involves their ability to sustain chronic proliferation [73].
Previous studies have reported that melatonin suppresses
the proliferation of several cancer cells and can be viewed
as an anti-mitogen [14, 89, 90]. Proliferating-cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) is a molecular marker for proliferation
because of its role in cell division; the inhibition of PCNA
is considered to be a viable anticancer strategy [91]. Our
recent study demonstrated that melatonin supplementation
downregulated PCNA expression and reduced the viability
in both lung cancer A549 and PC9 cells [14]. In SKLU-1 cells, melatonin treatment reduced the intensity
of nucleic acid/DNA [15]. When SK-LU-1 cells were
co-cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC), it induced the cell cycle arrest in the G0/
G1 phase; this may be also related to the enhancement
of immunomodulatory effect of melatonin [30] (Figure
3B). Considering the data discussed, it is likely that the
anti-proliferative actions of melatonin may be related to
its anticancer activity.

EFFECT
OF
MELATONIN
ON
IMMUNOMODULATION OF NSCLC
Correlation of immune system with cancer is a
dynamic and complex process, which involves their
reciprocally modulation of each other [61, 100]. The
major component of anticancer immunity involves of
both adaptive and innate immune responses, including
the involvement of tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T
(CTL) and T effector (Teff) cells, B cells, macrophages,
natural killer (NK) cells, and NK-T cells, etc. [100,
101]. Accordingly, strengthening anticancer immunity
is considered an effective means of promoting cancer
regression [102, 103].
Melatonin plays an important role in the immune
system [104, 105]. Circulating melatonin decreases with
age coinciding with the age-related decline of immune
system, which is referred to as immunosenescence,
contributing to an increased susceptibility to infectious
diseases, autoimmunity and cancer [106, 107].
Supplementation with melatonin prevents or delays the
functional deterioration of immune system during aging
[107]. Melatonin treatment prevents glucocorticoidinduced [108, 109] or age-related thymocytes apoptosis
[110, 111]; also, melatonin restores the degenerated
thymus by increasing thymus weight and the total number
of thymocytes [110, 112]. Moreover, melatonin treatment

CELL METASTASIS
Greater than 90% of cancer-related mortalities
result from metastases [92, 93]. Lung cancer cells
metastasize to brain, bone, contra-lateral lung, liver
and kidney, and metastatic growths are major cause of
cancer-related mortality in men and women worldwide
[94, 95]. Metastatic lesions are manifested in multiple
steps, including localized invasion and intravasation at
the primary tumor site, sustained survival in circulation,
extravasation at distant organ site and colonization at

also stimulates the production of natural killer (NK)
cells and macrophage/monocyte lineage cells in both
the marrow and the spleen [107, 113-115]. The elevated
NK cell number and function induced by melatonin are
attributed partly to the cytokines produced by melatoninstimulated T-helper cells, including IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, and
IFN-γ [105, 115].

Mounting evidence indicates that melatonin
modulates cancer immunity to inhibit the development
of NSCLC. Melatonin induced cytokine production has
been shown in human PBMC for IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL12 and IFN-γ [116-119]. When SK-LU-1 cells were
co-cultured with PBMC, Plaimee and colleagues [30]
reported that an indirect effect is exhibited at lower doses

of melatonin, enhancing human PBMC to counteract
proliferation, increase apoptosis and oxidative stress in
cancer cells. Moreover, Mocchegiani et al. [32] observed
that melatonin due to its immunoenhancing properties
decreased Lewis lung carcinoma metastasis in mice, with
consequent restoration of thymic efficiency and increment
of IL-2 production. Furthermore, in Lewis lung carcinoma
bearing mice, melatonin rescued myeloid progenitor cells
from chemotherapy induced apoptosis via a mechanism
involving the endogenous production of granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which
is produced by melatonin-stimulated bone marrow T
cells [114] (Figure 3D). Collectively, these results imply
that melatonin may have an indirect anticancer effect on
NSCLC cells by enhancing of immunomodulation.

in patients suffering with NSCLC [130], and reduced
chemotherapy related toxicity, including neurotoxicity,
thrombocytopenia,
myelosuppression,
asthenia,
cardiotoxicity, stomatitis, and weight loss by greater than
10%; however, melatonin did not limit alopecia or anemia
[8, 33, 128, 129, 131] (Figure 4). However, Egidio et al.
[132] suggested that 20 mg melatonin given orally at
night did not improve appetite, weight, or QOL compared
with placebo after studying 48 patients with advanced
lung or gastrointestinal cancer. Although the outcome of
current studies are inconsistent relative to the efficacy of
melatonin treatment for advanced NSCLC, a large scale
NSCLC patient sample given melatonin could yield
important findings.
Although the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, to treat advanced
NSCLC patients has become a standard of care, the use
of TKIs in NSCLC patients with T790M EGFR mutations
causes drug resistance [133, 134]. The most common
mechanism to explain the resistance seen in EGFR
mutation patients is the development of a secondary point
mutation in the EGFR active domain, substituting a bulky
methionine amino acid for threonine (T790M) [135].
Currently, the T790M mutation is estimated to represent
50-60% of resistance to the ﬁrst and second generation
EGFR mutation TKIs [136]. Recent work by Yun et al.
[133] reported that co-treatment of gefitinib with melatonin
effectively decreased the viability, downregulated EGFR
phosphorylation, and induced apoptosis in H1975 cells
with T790M somatic mutation. These findings indicate
that melatonin plus gefitinib may be an effective treatment
for NSCLC with EGFR mutations resistant to TKImonotherapy; clinical trials should be carried out to test
these combination therapy. Moreover, whether melatonin
enhances the efficacy of targeted therapy in NSCLC also
warrants further investigation.

DRUG SYNERGY OF MELATONIN WITH
CHEMOTHERAPY
Melatonin is an endogenous substance with low
toxicity and favorable compatibility [61]. In human
volunteers, oral administration of melatonin in doses
of 1-300 mg or 1 gram of melatonin daily for 30 days
resulted in no observable negative side effects [120, 121].
Combination studies of melatonin and chemotherapy
have been reported to enhance the efficacy of drug against
NSCLC cells and reduce the adverse therapeutic side
effects [5, 30, 122, 123] (see Table. 2). In experimental
studies, Kontek et al. [122] observed that the combination
of melatonin and irinotecan increases the amount of
DNA damage in A549 cells, but was not effective in
inducing DNA damage in healthy human lymphocytes.
Furthermore, melatonin supplementation rescued myeloid
progenitor cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis
[114]. Moreover, melatonin plus cisplatin or doxorubicin
enhanced the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy against
lung adenocarcinoma cells [5, 124]. Berberine, a plantderived agent, also exhibits anticancer effects. Lu et al.
[125] reported that treatment with melatonin effectively
increased berberine-induced apoptosis, and enhanced the
berberine-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, colony
formation and cell migration in H1299 and A549 cells.
The existence of cancer-related immunosuppression
has been demonstrated in several experimental and
clinical observation [126, 127]. Melatonin stimulated
IL-2 production via activating specific melatonin receptors
expressed by TH1-lymphocytes [106]. In small clinical
trials, Lissoni et al. [127] reported that the combination
treatment of melatonin with IL-2 further promotes tumor
regressions and improve 3-year survival in advanced
NSCLC patients. Moreover, melatonin significantly
enhanced the efficacy of the standard anticancer
chemotherapies (cisplatin and etoposide), and improved
the 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival in untreated metastatic
NSCLC patients [8, 33, 128, 129]. Additionally, melatonin
supplementation also improved quality of life (QOL)

MELATONIN AND RADIOTHERAPY
Conventionally, fractionated radiotherapy for
NSCLC consists of 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions given once daily
for 5 days each week for a total dose of 60 Gy or more
[137]. This treatment strategy is associated with improved
locoregional control and survival. This treatment,
however, also causes radiation-induced lung toxicity,
including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis [138]. It
has long been recognized that the damaging effects of
ionizing radiation are brought about by both direct (DNA
damage) and indirect (production of highly reactive free
radicals) mechanisms [120]. In 1993, the initial evidence
was provided related to the protective effects of melatonin
against electromagnetic radiation by ultraviolet light
[139]; thereafter, numerous papers have documented that
melatonin is an effective agent against radiation-induced
tissue damages [120, 140-142].
Several animal studies suggested that melatonin

treatment can reduce ionizing radiation-induced lung
injuries [7, 143, 144]. When the thoracic regions of
rats were irradiated (18 Gy), melatonin administration
inhibited lipid peroxidation and radiation-induced lung
injury [144]. Furthermore, Jang et al. [143] reported that
melatonin reduced radiation (12 Gy)-induced lung injury
in mice a shown by significant reduction in oxidative stress
and of the production of cytokines, including TGF-β1
and TNF-α. Moreover, Sener and colleagues [7] reported
that melatonin reduced damage to the lung, liver, colon
and ileum, after whole body irradiation (800 cGy) to rats
(Figure 4) and Vijuyalaxmi and co-workers [145] found
that melatonin preserved the survival of mice exposed to a
lethal dose of ionizing radiation (815 cGy). In sum, results
suggest that supplementing cancer patients with adjuvant
therapy of melatonin may alleviate the symptoms due to
radiation-induced organ injury. Additionally, the efficacy
of melatonin in combination with radiotherapy should be
tested in NSCLC patients.

results imply an correlation between melatonin and HPFs,
but whether melatonin reduces the secretion of potent
oncogenic molecules by CAFs, such as TGF-β [161] and
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [162], or inhibits other
tumor microenvironment members, such as immune
inﬂammatory cells and endothelial cells [163], should be
investigated.
In breast or colon cancer, evident experimental
studies have confirmed a correlation between the
disruption of the melatonin rhythm and cancer [164,
165]. Although the epidemiologic surveys suggest that
men who worked at night at anytime have a higher risk
for lung cancer, with excesses apparent across all main
histologic subtypes [50], additional evidence for this
from experimental studies is urgently needed. While the
anticancer mechanisms of melatonin in breast cancer
has been extensively explored [87, 97, 166], the antilung cancer actions of melatonin have been generally
overlooked.

POTENTIAL DIRECTIONS

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Research related to the anticancer actions of
melatonin on NSCLC cells has made only minor progress.
One aspect that should be further examined is the antiangiogenic actions of melatonin in NSCLC [27, 146].
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a highly
active angiogenic factor, and the evidence of abnormally
high blood VEGF levels has been proven to be associated
with poor prognosis in cancer patients [147]. Lissoni et
al. [31] reported that melatonin treatment reduces serum
VEGF levels in advanced cancer patients (containing 8
NSCLC patients). Moreover, Dai et al. [148] suggested
that melatonin suppresses endogenous VEGF expression
in A549 cells. However, the mechanisms of melatonin’s
antiangiogenic in any tumor including NSCLC are
still unclear. Numerous studies have documented that
melatonin exhibits antiangiogenic actions, in part, by
downregulating VEGF and HIF-1α in several cancers via
different mechanisms; the cancer types included breast
[16, 149], prostate [150-152], colon [153, 154], liver
[155], and pancreatic cancer [156, 157]. These studies
may provide reference for the future work in the NSCLC
research field.
Fibroblasts are a component of the tumor
microenvironment. Activated fibroblasts release mediators
such as growth factors, cytokines and immune modulators
[158]. Fibroblasts with this altered phenotype are termed
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) which largely
contribute to the establishment of a reactive tumor
stoma that is permissive of even conductive to cancer
cell survival [158, 159]. Kim et al. [160] suggested that
melatonin suppresses acrolein-induced IL-8 production
via extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2)
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signal
inhibition in human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPFs). These

Melatonin may be a potential anticancer drug in
the treatment of NSCLC as well as other cancer types.
Since melatonin treatment enhances the efficacy and
reduces the side-effects of radio- or chemotherapies, and
its exogenous supplementation may allow for the use
of larger amounts of conventional treatments thereby
exaggerating their effectiveness as anticancer treatments.
Furthermore, melatonin, via its anti-proliferative, proapoptotic, anti-metastatic, and immunostimulatory
actions, should be given more consideration as an effective
oncostatic agent. Inasmuch as melatonin has low toxicity
and highly favorable compatibility, further clinical trials
which include melatonin and the clarification of additional
molecular processes of melatonin’s oncostatic effects will
help to facilitate better applications of melatonin in the
area of NSCLC treatment.
