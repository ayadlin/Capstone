ABSTRACT
Tumor metastasis and invasion are both hallmarks of cancer malignancy and the
leading cause of cancer death. Here we show that the adaptor protein SORBS1 (Sorbin
and SH3 domain-containing protein 1, also known as CAP/ponsin) is expressed at
low levels in clinical cancer samples. In addition, low-level expression of SORBS1
was significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes and the increased tumor
cell invasive capacity in breast cancer patients. We demonstrate that depletion of
SORBS1 increases protrusions and filopodium-like protrusions (FLPs) formation, as
well as the migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells, via activation of JNK/cJun.
Furthermore, silencing of SORBS1 promotes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) process and attenuates chemical drug sensitivity especially that to cisplatin, by
inhibition of p53 in breast cancer cells. Thus, we illustrate that SORBS1 is a potential
inhibitor of metastasis in cancer and may be a promising target in chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

paxillin [14], Grb2 [15], and ArgBP2 [16]) have effects on
invasion and metastasis via changes in actin cytoskeleton,
cell-cell/ECM adhesions, or EMT. Although the basic
knowledge related to this process has been explored
for long time, the underlying key elements are largely
unknown and the functions of many suspected regulators
remain to be verified.
SORBS1 (Sorbin and SH3 domain-containing
protein 1, also known as CAP/ponsin) is an adaptor
protein that belongs to SOHO family [17, 18]. It has
been reported that SORBS1 localizes at both cell-ECM
and cell-cell adhesion sites. Additional studies reveal that
SORBS1 can bind to signaling molecules (e.g., c-Cbl [19],
c-Abl [20, 21], and insulin reporter (IR) [20]) to regulate
glucose transport [22, 23], transcription activity [18], and
insulin signaling [20, 21]. Moreover, SORBS1 can interact
with cytoskeleton regulators (e.g., vinculin [24], paxillin
[25], nectin, afadin [26]) to modulate cell adhesion [27],
cytoskeleton organization [18, 28], cell spreading, and
cell motility [27]. In addition, SORBS1 attenuates cell
motility via inhibition of PAK/MEK/ERK activity in

Metastasis is responsible for as much as 90%
of cancer-associated mortality; this process remains
the most poorly understood component of cancer
pathogenesis. Previous studies have shown that the
typical characteristics of malignancy involve enhanced
migratory and invasive abilities and morphological
changes of cells via reorganization of cytoskeleton and
the disordering of cell-cell/extracellular matrix (ECM)
adhesions [1–4]. Additionally, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) is a potential mechanism by which tumor
cells gain metastatic features [2, 4–6]. Recently, several
reports revealed that filopodium-like protrusions (FLPs)
can facilitate the proliferation of cancer cells that infiltrate
into the parenchyma of foreign tissues following egress
from the primary site [4, 7]. Furthermore, research on
the underlying molecular mechanisms demonstrate that
both adhesion molecules (for example, E-cadherin [8, 9],
N-cadherin [9], vimentin [10] and integrins [11]) and
adaptor proteins (for example, vinculin [12], afadin [13],

REF52 fibroblasts [27]. Furthermore, SORBS1 has been
described as a new target of p53 in a colon cancer cell line
model [29].
In the present study, we explored whether SORBS1
plays a critical role in tumor migration, invasion,
and tumorigenesis. We employed data obtained from
the Oncomine and Kaplan Meier-plotter websites
to investigate the effects of SORBS1 loss on cancer
metastasis and chemical drug sensitivity. Our data
proved that the low-level SORBS1 has clinically positive
correlation with the progression of breast and lung cancers.
Additionally, we demonstrated, using three-dimensional
(3D) cell culture and in vivo models, that the depletion
of SORBS1 enhances the migratory and invasive abilities
and increases FLPs formation via activation of JNK/cJun signaling in cancer cells. We then demonstrated that
SORBS1 is positively correlated with the drug sensitivity
of breast cancer cells via increased accumulation of p53
protein after chemical drug treatment. In conclusion, our
work illustrates that SORBS1 impedes cancer-metastasis
and sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy. We expect
that SORBS1 may be a useful marker and/or target for
designing new therapeutic strategies and for evaluating
the prognostic outcome in patients with breast cancer or
lung cancer.

with higher SORBS1 expression levels (Figure 1D–1E).
All of these analyses indicated that decreased levels of
SORBS1 have significantly positive correlation with poor
clinical outcomes and more malignant phenotype in breast
cancer patients.
We extended these observations in breast cancer
by examining the levels of SORBS1 in lung cancer cell
lines, analyzing the Oncomine gene expression datasets for lung carcinoma and OS of lung cancer patients
(based on analyses obtained from the Kaplan Meier-plotter
website [31]). Consistent with the results in breast cancer,
lower SORBS1 mRNA levels also were detected in lung
cancer cell lines and lung cancer samples (Supplementary
Figure S1A–S1B, Supplementary Table S3). In addition,
patients harboring tumors with lower SORBS1 expression
levels (N = 966) showed decreased OS probabilities
compared to those in patients harboring tumors with higher
SORBS1 expression levels (N = 960) (Supplementary
Figure S1C).

Loss of SORBS1 increases breast cancer cells
migration and invasion properties both in vivo
and in vitro
To define the effects of SORBS1 deficiency on
breast cancer progression, we used virus-mediated
RNA interference to “knock down” the expression of
SORBS1 in MCF10A, HBL100, and MDA-MB-231 cell
lines. Western blot analysis confirmed that SORBS1
were decreased in each of these cell lines (Figure 2A).
Subsequent analysis indicated that loss of SORBS1 had
no significant impact on cell proliferation (Supplementary
Figure S2A–S2C). The result from an in vitro woundhealing assay using MCF10A showed that MCF10A
shSORBS1 cell lines (designated MCF10A shSORBS1-1
and MCF10A shSORBS1-2) displayed higher motility
than the parent control cell line, MCF10A (Supplementary
Figure S2D). Transwell assays in MCF10A, MDAMB-231, and HBL100 cell lines with knockdown of
SORBS1 demonstrated that loss of SORBS1 resulted
in increased migration (Figure 2B–2G) and invasion
(Figure  2H–2M). To verify the suppressive role of
SORBS1 in tumor migration and invasion, we also tested
the effect of overexpressing SORBS1 in another human
breast cancer cell line, SUM159. Notably, elevation of
SORBS1 expression inhibited the migratory and invasive
abilities of SUM159 cells (Figure 2N-2P). In extension
of our work with breast cancer cell lines, we also found
that knockdown of SORBS1 in a lung cancer cell line
(CRL-1848TM) also enhanced migratory and invasive
abilities (Supplementary Figure S3).
Next, we explored the impact of SORBS1 on breast
cancer malignancy and metastasis in vivo using a mouse
model in which MDA-MB-231 Control and MDAMB-231 shSORBS1 (shSORBS1-1 and shSORBS1-2) cell
lines were implanted by intravenous via the tail. Consistent

RESULTS
SORBS1 is present at a lower level in human
breast cancer
To explore the function of SORBS1 in breast
tumorigenesis, we investigated the protein levels of
SORBS1 in breast cancer cells. We found that levels of
SORBS1 were lower in the majority of breast cancer cells
compared to the level in the normal mammary epithelial
cell line MCF10A (Figure 1A). Consistent with those
results, analyses of two independent Oncomine datasets, Richardson Breast 2 and Curtis Breast, revealed
that SORBS1 mRNA levels were lower in breast
carcinoma patient samples (Richardson Breast 2,N = 40;
Curtis Breast, N = 14) compared with those in normal
breast samples (Richardson Breast 2, N = 7; Curtis
Breast, N = 144) (Figure 1B, Supplementary Table S1).
Furthermore, analyses of the Curtis Breast and Nikolsky
Breast data-sets in Oncomine also suggested that the
lower levels of SORBS1 were significantly correlated
with the higher invasive ability in ductal and lobular
breast carcinoma (Figure 1C, Supplementary Table S2).
To further investigate whether SORBS1 correlated
with prognosis of patients with breast cancer, an online
Kaplan Meier-plotter website [30] was used for analyses.
Among patients with or without systemic treatment, the
probability of overall survival (OS) and distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS) was dramatically worse in patients
with lower SORBS1 expression levels than that in patients

with the in vitro results, MDA-MB-231 shSORBS1injected animals exhibited (at Day 21 post-injection) a
significantly elevated number of micro-metastases in the
lung compared to animals injected with the MDA-MB-231
Control cell line (Figure 2Q–2R). Collectively, our data
demonstrated SORBS1 impedes migration and invasion
in vitro and suppresses metastasis in vivo.

Therefore, we used 3D culture to extend our analyses from
2D (plate) growth. When assessed in a 3D culture system,
SORBS1-silenced MCF10A, HBL100 and MDA-MB-231
cells exhibited more malignant phenotypes compared
with controls including increases in both the numbers
of protrusions and the lengths of those protrusions
(Figure 3A–3F). Furthermore, we observed the formation
of filopodium-like protrusions (FLPs) and the data showed
that the cells lack of SORBS1 developed more abundant
FLPs than the control cells (Figure 3G–3I). In contrast,
forced expression of SORBS1 in SUM159 led to decreased
numbers of FLPs (Figure 3J). Thus, under 3D culture
conditions, the level of SORBS1 expression is inversely
correlated with the development of a more malignant
phenotype in breast cancer cell lines.

Loss of SORBS1 expression triggers increased
protrusion formation and abundant FLPs in 3D
culture
3D culture recreates the architecture of epithelial
tissue growth in vitro, and so is a powerful tool for
investigating the molecular mechanisms of tumor growth.

Knockdown of SORBS1 induces epithelial-tomesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells

depletion of SORBS1 led to dramatic increases in EMT
in breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and HBL100
(Figure 4D–4E). Conversely, we observed attenuation of the
EMT phenotype in 4T1 (a highly metastatic mouse breast
cancer cell line) and in SUM159 with forced expression of
SORBS1 (Figure 4F–4G). Furthermore, our results indicated
that there was a negative correlation between SORBS1
expression level and EMT pattern in MCF7 (Supplementary
Figure S4A). Altogether, these results demonstrate that
SORBS1 suppresses EMT in breast cancer cells.
We hypothesized that SORBS1 plays the similar
role in lung cancer cells. Indeed, we obtained the expected
results in non-small-cell lung cancer cells CRL-1848TM
(Supplementary Figure S4B–S4C). Considered together,
these data conclusively demonstrate that depletion of
SORBS1 promotes EMT in cancer cell lines.

To explore the biologic basis for metastasis in
SORBS1-depleted cells, we monitored whether SORBS1
depletion induced the propensity to undergo the process of
EMT. Whether assessed by mRNA level or protein level,
depletion of SORBS1 led to decreased expression of an
epithelial marker (E-cadherin) and increased expression
of mesenchymal markers (including N-cadherin, vimentin,
and Slug) in MCF 10A shSORBS1 cells compared
with expression in control cells (Figure 4A–4B).
Immunofluorescent (IF) staining for EMT markers
E-cadherin, vimentin, and Slug in MCF10A cell lines
with and without SORBS1 knockdown confirmed these
effects on EMT (Figure 4C). In further confirmation,

SORBS1 inhibits JNK signaling pathway

Inhibition of JNK activity decreases migration,
invasion, and FLPs formation in SORBS1
knockdown cells

Previous work has shown that SORBS1 has a
negative impact on cell motility via inhibiting the ERK
pathway [27]. However, in our own research, we have not
detected significant changed in ERK activation in SORBS1silenced cell lines (data not shown). Unexpectedly,
we did observe that JNK/c-Jun, a component of the
MAPK pathway, was dramatically activated not only
in MCF10A shSORBS1 cells (Figure  5A) but also in
HBL100 shSORBS1 cells (Figure 5C) and MDA-MB-231
shSORBS1 cells (Figure 5D) when compared with
respective control cells. In addition, we observed (by IF
staining) increased phosphorylation of c-Jun in MCF10A
shSORBS1 cells (Figure 5B). In contrast, overexpression
of SORBS1 resulted in decreased activation of JNK
and c-Jun in 4T1 and SUM159 (Figure 5E and 5F).
Furthermore, we demonstrated that overexpression of
SORBS1 yielded decreased phosphorylation of JNK and
c-Jun in MCF7 cells, an effect that exhibited apparent dose
dependence (Supplementary Figure S5). Taken together,
these results demonstrated that SORBS1 inhibits the
activation of JNK and c-Jun in breast cancer cells.

It has been reported that JNK/c-Jun signaling
promotes migration and invasion in multiple cancers
[32, 33]. Therefore, we next investigated whether SORBS1
inhibits cell migration and invasion via suppression of
JNK/c-Jun activation. For this purpose, we employed
SP600125, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of JNK
kinase activation. Using an in vitro wound healing assay,
we confirmed that increased cell motility of MCF10A upon
knockdown of SORBS1 was attenuated by treatment with
SP600125 (Supplementary Figure S6). Notably, the data
from transwell assay showed that the enhanced migration
and invasion patterns induced by depletion of SORBS1
were rescued in MCF10A shSORBS1 cells treated with
SP600125 (Figure 6A–6C). Furthermore, treatment with
SP600125 also blocked the migration and invasion in
MDA-MB-231 shSORBS1 cell lines (Figure 6D–6F) and
HBL100 shSORBS1 cell lines (Figure 6G–6I) compared
with the respective untreated shSORBS1 cell lines. These

SORBS1 promotes cisplatin-related drug
sensitivity in breast cancer cells

results indicated that SORBS1 suppresses cell migration and
invasion via JNK/c-Jun signaling in breast cancer cells. We
further investigated that whether SORBS1 regulated FLPs
formation by inhibition of JNK activation. Our data showed
that SP600125 dramatically abolished the enhanced FLPs
formation previously observed upon SORBS1 depletion
in MCF 10A and breast cancer cells (Figure 6L–6N).
Consistent with those data, SP600125 treatment also
suppressed FLPs formation, migration and invasion in the
SUM159 (Figure 6J–6K, 6O). Considered together, these
results illustrated that SORBS1 antagonizes migration,
invasion and FLPs formation through JNK/c-Jun pathway.

Growing evidence suggests that EMT contributes
the resistance of cancer cells to cancer drugs [34–37].
We used flow cytometry to measure the potential effects
of SORBS1 on the induction of apoptosis by cisplatin,
which is clinically one of the most frequently used anticancer drugs. Loss of SORBS1 expression significantly
decreased cisplatin-induced cellular apoptosis in MCF10A
and in breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and
HBL100 (Figure 7A-7C). In contrast, forced expression

of SORBS1 in SUM159 and MCF7 remarkably increased
the frequency of cellular apoptosis induced by cisplatin
(Figure 7D, Supplementary Figure S7). To define the
molecular mechanism of these effects, we determined the
levels of apoptosis-related molecules (e.g., p53, cleavedcaspase3) in breast cancer cells that had been treated
with cisplatin. We observed that the levels of p53 and
cleaved-caspase3 activity were dramatically suppressed
in cisplatin-treated, SORBS1-depleted cell lines (MCF10
shSORBS1 and MDA-MB-231 shSORBS1) compared to
cisplatin-treated control cell lines unaltered in SORBS1
expression (Figure 7E–7F). In confirmation of these
data, we further demonstrated that the levels of p53 and
cleaved-caspase3 were downregulated in cisplatin-treated
HBL100 shSORBS1 cells compared to cisplatin-treated
HBL100 control cells (Figure 7G–7H). Conversely, levels
of p53 and cleaved-caspase3 were significantly increased
in cisplatin-treated SUM159 cells with forced expression
SORBS1 compared to cisplatin-treated SUM159 control
cells (Figure 7I). Considered together, these data
demonstrated that SORBS1 has positive correlation with
cisplatin sensitivity via increasing p53 protein levels in
breast cancer cells.
To determine whether loss of SORBS1 causes
increased resistance to other chemotherapeutic drugs,

we assessed the mRNA and protein level of SORBS1
in several commercially obtained cell lines (MCF7-Adr,
SGC7901-DDP, and SKBR3-DDP) reported to possess
chemical drug resistance. As a first step, we confirmed that
each of these strains exhibited elevated (4.5- to 350-fold)
IC50s compared to the respective parent lines (Figure 7J).
As expected, each of these drug-resistant strains also
exhibited lower levels of SORBS1 protein than the
respective parent lines (Figure 7K). Furthermore, we used
Kaplan Meier-plotter website [31] to define the potential
correlation between SORBS1 level and overall survival
of patients treated with chemotherapy (based on clinical
data from 69 breast cancer patients treated with systemic
cisplatin chemotherapy and 176 chemotherapy treated lung
cancer patients). The analyses indicated that patients with
low-level SORBS1 expression (Breast cancer, N = 27;
Lung cancer, N = 125) exhibited decreased OS probability
compared to patients with high-level SORBS1 expression
(Breast cancer, N = 42; Lung cancer, N = 51) (Figure 7L).
Therefore, loss of SORBS1 could reduce the sensitivity
to cisplatin as well as establish chemotherapeutic drugs
resistance in multiple types of cancer cells. Thus, our
analyses indicated that SORBS1 deficiency is positively
correlated with a poorer response to cancer chemotherapy
in multiple cancer types.

with poorer clinical outcomes. Second, we used in vitro
(2D & 3D culture systems) and in vivo (animal model)
systems to assess malignancy of cell lines engineered
to express SORBS1 at decreased or increased levels.
These experiments demonstrated that SORBS1 levels
are inversely correlated with migration, invasion, FLPs
formation, and EMT activity in both breast and lung
cancer cell lines, as well as resistance to chemical drugs
such as cisplatin. These experiments also revealed that

This study provides novel insights into the function
of SORBS1 in breast and lung cancers. SORBS1 is
known to be major negative player in the control of
cellular migration of fibroblast cell by down-regulation
of PAK/MEK/ERK signaling [27, 28]. However, the role
of SORBS1 in tumorigenesis remained largely unknown
prior to the work described here. First, we demonstrated
that decreased SORBS1 levels are positively correlated

transformation is mediated by repressed JNK/c-Jun
activation, and that the suppression of SORBS1 in drug
resistance is mediated by increased p53 level.
To overcome obstacles to invasion, tumor cells
may co-opt the EMT process, which may govern
morphogenesis in multi-cellular organisms and promote
tumorigenesis and metastasis [5, 34]. We observed that
depletion of SORBS1 is sufficient for facilitating EMT
process. Additionally, prior studies suggest that EMT can
encourage the formation of FLPs in 3D culture [7, 38].
Therefore, we hypothesized that SORBS1 might inhibit
the formation of FLPs. As we postulated, the formation of
FLPs was markedly increased in SORBS1-depleted breast
cancer cells. We further confirmed the repressive effects
of SORBS1 on cancer metastasis in vivo using a mouse
model of pulmonary metastasis by a breast cancer cell line.
These results demonstrated that the SORBS1 gene not only
inhibits EMT activation but also potentially suppresses the
process whereby extravasated cancer cells colonize distal
sites and develop into metastatic carcinoma.
The MAPK pathway is central mediator of eukaryotic
cellular signaling, playing important roles in cancer
proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis [39–41].
Recent data suggest that SORBS1 may repress cell
spreading and migration by inhibiting the activation of RAF/
MEK/ERK signaling in fibroblast cells [27]. Therefore, we
sought to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism
whereby depletion of SORBS1 resulted in the elevated
migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells. In the work
reported here, we found that overexpression of SORBS1
inhibited the activation of JNK and the downstream
molecule c-Jun, but had no effect on ERK or p38 signaling
in breast cancer or lung cancer cells. Previous studies
have shown that JNK signaling can stimulate EMT via
cooperation with other EMT-related signaling pathways
(such as Wnt/TGF-beta) in cancer cells [41–43]. Thus, our
data indicated that SORBS1 might impede the EMT process
via activation of JNK/c-Jun signaling. Specifically, we
demonstrated that SORBS1 knockdown induced EMT, FLPs
formation, migration, and invasion, and that these effects
were abrogated by treatment of the same cancer cells with a
small-molecule JNK inhibitor.
Drug resistance has been regarded as a major
obstacle in cancer treatment, with resistance typically
leading to the failure of chemotherapy. Several previous
reports have shown that the progression of EMT attenuates
cancer cell sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs [34, 35, 37]. As
reported here, our studies indicated that SORBS1 inhibits
EMT, suggesting that SORBS1 also might impact drug
sensitivity. Consistent with that hypothesis, we observed
that SORBS1 protein accumulates to significantly lower
levels in drug-resistant cancer cell lines compared to
the respective parental lines. Moreover, the level of
SORBS1 expression was positively correlated with
cisplatin sensitivity in breast cancer cells. Additionally,
an analysis performed using the Kaplan Meier-plotter
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

website revealed that low-level SORBS1 expression
(in specimens obtained from patients who were treated
with chemotherapy) positively correlated with lower OS
among breast cancer or lung cancer patients. Considered
together, these results suggest a negative role for SORBS1
in responsivity to cancer chemotherapy.
Previous work has shown that (in some cases)
JNK is a major regulator of cisplatin-induced apoptosis
in cancer cells [44–46]. However, the work described
here suggests that the role of SORBS1 in drug resistance
might be independent of JNK activation. Notably, we
demonstrated that SORBS1 may stimulate cisplatin
sensitivity via increase of p53 protein levels in various
cancer cell lines. However, the exact mechanism(s)
whereby SORBS1 upregulates p53 level during
chemotherapy remains unclear and will be the subject of
further research in our laboratory. Given the promotion of
SORBS1 in anti-cancer-drug sensitivity, we are planning
to initiate a computational analysis and screening program
to identify compounds that bind SORBS1. The resulting
compound would then be used for the design of structural
analogues that could serve as agonists of SORBS1 that
permit the reactivation of the p53 pathway to counter
chemo-resistance. In the short term, SORBS1 is expected
to serve as a valuable marker for screening clinical
specimens for metastatic and drug-resistance potential.
In conclusion, our data illustrate for the first time that
SORBS1 serves as a potential suppressor of tumorigenesis
and metastasis by impeding JNK activation in both
breast and lung cancers. Notably, our results provide
a novel perspective on the role of the SORBS1 protein
in attenuating the efficacy of cisplatin chemotherapy by
increasing the accumulation of p53 protein during the
treatment of breast and lung cancers. Thus, our studies
may serve to explain some of the failures of cisplatinclass drugs in clinical settings; these challenges may, at
least in part, reflect deficiencies in SORBS1 (and thus of
p53) following chemotherapy treatment. Thus, our results
define SORBS1 as a promising therapeutic target for
multiple types of cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
SUM159, HBL100, MCF7, MDA-MB-468, MDAMB-435, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, BT549, and 293T cells
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC; Manassas, VA). All of the above cells grown in
DMEM medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone Logan, UT, USA)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). A549,
CRL-1848TM, CRL-5803, CRL-5866, CRL-5833, 827,
PC-9, 95D, HTB-182, and HTB-177 cells were obtained
from the ATCC and maintained in RPMI-1640 (Hyclone)
medium. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10A
9117

Oncotarget

was purchased from ATCC and cultured in DMEM/F12
medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% horse
serum (Life Technologies), 10 µg/mL insulin (Sigma),
100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma), 20 ng/mL epidermal
growth factor (EGF, R&D), 0.5 µg/mL hydrocortisone
(Sigma), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The normal lung
epithelial cell line BEAS-2B was obtained from ATCC and
maintained in LHC-8 (Gibco, USA). All cell lines were
grown by incubation at 37ºC in a humidified 5% CO2
atmosphere.

Lentivirus preparation, infection, and selection
were performed as described previously [47]. Lentivirus
production and transduction were performed according to
the vector’s technical manual.

MTT assay
Cells were seeded at suitable densities (depending
on the specific experimental procedure) in 96-well
plates. After the addition of 20 μL/well of MTT solution
(Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide, Sigma, St. Louis,
USA), plates were incubated for an additional 6 hr, at
which time culture medium was removed from the wells.
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma, St. Louis, USA)
was added at 100 μL/well and plates were incubated for
20 min in a 37ºC incubator. Absorbance at a wavelength
of 570 nm was measured with a microplate reader (BioRad, CA, USA). For the cell proliferation assay, cell were
plated at 5000 cells/well in multiple 96-well plates, and
MTT then was added to separate plates after 12, 24, 48, or
72 hr of growth. For the measurement of IC50, cells were
seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well. On the following day, medium
containing various concentrations of SP600125 (Sigma,
St. Louis, USA) or no inhibitor was added to the wells
and the plates were incubated for a further 24 hr. Each
treatment was performed in four replicate wells. Each
experiment was repeated three separate times.

Plasmids and transfection
The cDNA ORF encoding human SORBS1
was amplified from human genomic DNA by PCR
and subcoloned between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of
pCMV-C-Myc (Beyotime). Mouse Sorbs1 was a gift
from Dr. Alan Saltiel (Michigan University, USA). Cells
were transiently transfected by using Lipofectamine
2000 reagent (Life Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The transfected cells were
incubated for 48 hours at 37ºC followed by biochemical
and biological assays.

Western blots
Total cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (Cell
Signaling) with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche),
phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT,
Sigma) and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma) for 30 min on ice, and
then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4ºC. The
supernatant was recovered and protein concentration was
determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Hercules, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Western blot
assays were performed as previously described [13]. The
primary antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-SORBS1,
anti-GAPDH, and anti-β-actin antibody from Abmart;
anti-Hsp90, anti-Snail, anti-Slug, anti-vimentin, anti-JNK,
anti-p-JNK, anti-c-Jun, anti-p-c-Jun, anti-p53, anti-caspase3,
and anti-cleaved-caspase3 antibodies and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated secondary antibodies from
Cell Signaling Technology; and anti-E-cadherin and antiN-cadherin antibodies from BD Transduction Laboratories.

RNA Isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen). Aliquots (1 μg each) of RNA were reverse
transcribed using a Takara PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit
(Takara) to generate cDNA; reverse transcription was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The resulting cDNA was used for real-time PCR with
a SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ Kit (Takara) in a StepOne
Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Values
were normalized against those of a housekeeping gene
(GAPDH). The primers used for real-time PCR are shown

4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton
X-100, blocked with PBS containing 10% goat serum,
and incubated overnight with antibodies at 4ºC. Fixed
and stained coverslips or slides were washed 3 times with
PBS, and primary antibodies were labeled by incubation
with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Invitrogen). The coverslips or slides then were mounted
with mounting medium containing DAPI (Prolong Gold
Antifade Reagent, Life Technologies), and cells were
visualized with confocal laser microscopy (Carl Zeiss).

Wound-healing assays
Cells were seeded in a 6-well flat-bottomed
plate at a density of 4sit5/well per the manufacturer’s
recommendation. Cells were allowed to grow to 90%
confluence and then serum starved for 24 hr in medium
lacking FBS. After aspiration of the medium, a 200-μL
pipette tip was used to scratch each monolayer of cells.
Wells were flooded with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and emptied to remove detached cells; complete medium
then was added and plates were incubated for the indicated
time intervals. The scratched cells were photographed at
different times as indicated using microscopy. ImageJ
software was used to measure cell migration ability by
calculating open wound area as a percentages of the initial
blank area (containing no cells). Data are presented as the
means of three independent experiments.

Xenograft tumor model and histological analysis
All animal experimental procedures and protocols
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the Institute for Nutritional
Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences,
Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). These
experiments used either or two stably transfected cell
lines (MDA-MB-231 shSORBS1-1 and MDA-MB-231
shSORBS1-2) or a control cell line (MDA-MB-231
Control). Actively growing cells (4 × 105 cells in 100 uL
PBS per mouse) were implanted into 6-week-old male
nude mice (10 mice/group) by intravenous injection via
the tail vein. On Day 21 post-injection, the mice were
sacrificed and tissues were harvested for examination by
histological analysis.
Specifically, the lungs were fixed with formalin,
dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned using
standard methodologies. Lungs were examined using 6-μm
thick, 200-μm step sections stained with haematoxylin
and eosin (HE) and evaluated by light microscopy for
the presence of micro-metastases. The numbers of micrometastases were counted in five randomly selected fields
under light microscopy in each of five randomly selected
tissue sections from each lung. The “average lung
metastases” was defined as the calculated mean number
of micro-metastases counted by randomly selected four
fields under light microscope.

Transwell migration and invasion assays
Migration assay was performed in 24-well inserts
with 8-μm pores (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA), and
the cell invasion assay was performed in 24-well inserts
with 8-μm pores coated with Matrigel (Corning Inc.,
Corning, NY, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocols.
Cells (4 × 104 cells in 200 uL of blank (no FBS) medium
containing 0.2% BSA per insert) were seeded in the upper
side of each insert and complete medium was added to
the bottom side of each insert. After incubation for 24 hr.
(for migration assay) or 48 hr (for invasion assay), nonmigrated cells were removed from the upper side of the
insert with a cotton swab; this process left the migrated
cells on the bottom side of the insert. Inserts from both
the migration assay and invasion assay were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, stained with a 0.1%
crystal violet solution for 30 min, and photographed using
an Olympus IX51 microscope. The numbers of cells were
counted using ImageJ software. Data are presented as the
means from at least three randomly selected fields.

Cell apoptosis
After growing to 80–90% confluence in 6-well
plates, cells were treated with cisplatin as indicated for
24 hr. Apoptotic cells were labeled using the Annexin V
apoptosis detection kit (Bio-Vision, SF, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, and cells were analyzed
using a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
USA) and Flowjo software.

3D cell culture and FLP formation
MCF10A, HBL100, and MDA-MB-231 cells
were cultured on Matrigel as described previously [47].
As indicated, cells were propagated for 24 hr (for FLP
formation) or 5–12 days (for normal culture). Phase
images were captured using an Olympus IX51 microscope.

Oncomine data analysis
Datasets from the Oncomine database were analyzed
as previously described [48]. Briefly, the gene SORBS1
was searched using the threshold values as follows: foldchange of 2, P value of 0.05, and gene rank in the top
10% among all differentially expressed genes. All the

Immunofluorescence and confocal imaging

published dataset, the values were linked to the graphical
representations of the original microarray dataset. An
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to calculate
P-value.

To analyze the prognostic value of SORBS1 in
breast cancer or lung cancer, data were analyzed with
the KM plotter (http://kmplot.com/analysis/). In brief,
for the analyses of the correlaton between SORBS1 level
and clinical outcome in breast cancer and lung cancer,
the patients who were with or without treatment were
selected; and for the analyses of the correlation between
SORBS1 level and chemotherapy drug sensitivity, the
treated chemotherapy patients were selected. Survival
curves were generated by using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter
online tool based on data stratified based on the best cutoff. Hazard ratios (HR) and p values (log rank p) are
shown at the top of the panel.
