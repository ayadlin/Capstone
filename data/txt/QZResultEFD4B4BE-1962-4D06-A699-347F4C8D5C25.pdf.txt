Abstract

Author Manuscript

We identified a discrete number of microRNAs differentially expressed in benign or malignant
mesothelial tissues. We focused on mir-145 whose levels were significantly downregulated in
malignant mesothelial tissues and Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cell lines as compared
to benign tissues (pleura, peritoneum or cysts). We show that promoter hyper-methylation caused
very low levels in MPM cell lines. Treatment of MPM cell lines with mir-145 agonists negatively
modulated some protumorigenic properties of MPM cells, such as clonogenicity, cell migration
and resistance to pemetrexed treatment. The main effector mechanism of the clonogenic death
induced by mir-145 was that of accelerated senescence. We found that mir-145 targeted OCT4 via
specific binding to its 3’-UTR. Increased intracellular levels of mir-145 decreased the levels of
OCT4 and its target gene ZEB1 thereby counteracting the increase of OCT4 induced by
pemetrexed treatment which is known to favor the development of chemoresistant cells. In line
with this, reintroduction of OCT4 into mimic-145 treated cells counteracted the effects on
clonogenicity and replicative senescence. This further supports the relevance of the mir-145OCT4 interaction for the survival of MPM cells. The potential use of mir-145 expression levels to
classify benign vs malignant mesothelial tissues and the differences between pemetrexed-induced
senescence and that induced by the re-expression of mir-145 are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a tumor originating from the mesothelial surfaces
of the lung and characterized by an overall bad prognosis(1). Chronic inflammation
(consequent to asbestos exposure) and genetic predisposition are major players in MPM
pathogenesis (2). Additionally, because of the use of asbestos in the ‘70s, the incidence of
MPM is expected to peak in the next few years (2). Two main features influence the
prognosis of MPM: first, its silent clinical progression, which leads to very late diagnosis
and thus strongly limits therapeutic intervention (i.e surgical resection). Second, its extreme
resistance to current chemotherapeutic agents which dramatically hampers the disease-freesurvival of the treated patients (3, 4). Therefore, identification of diagnostic biomarkers for
MPM would be relevant for early diagnosis and patient stratification, in addition to
contributing to our understanding of the basic mechanisms of MPM progression.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are short (17–22 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs that regulate gene
expression by inhibiting protein translation, through base-pairing mediated interaction with
the 3’UTR of target mRNAs(5, 6). Given their ability to simultaneously target multiple
genes/pathways, transient or stable modulation of intracellular microRNA levels is a
powerful way to transduce adaptive stimuli leading to broad changes in pathway activation.
Growing evidence suggest that microRNAs play a major role in oncogenesis, with either
tumor suppressor or tumor-promoting modalities(7–9). MicroRNAs are much more stable
than mRNAs and this phenomenon allows an assessment of their expression levels
retrospectively from frozen or fixed tissues. This feature, together with their rather tissuespecific expression, has prompted the study of microRNAs expression levels as an important
diagnostic and prognostic tool for a number of solid and non-solid malignancies (9).
Additionally, the study of cancer-associated microRNAs may prove useful in order to
elucidate the mechanism(s) behind cell transformation. For example, the identification of
low levels of mir-29c* in MPM has provided both a prognostic tool for epithelial MPM and
has pointed to aberrant chromatin methylation for the progression of MPM(10). Here we
investigated whether specific microRNAs could distinguish malignant mesotheliomas from
benign mesothelial lesions (mesothelial cysts, normal pleura and peritoneum). This allowed
us to identify a discrete group of microRNAs possibly endowed with diagnostic potential.
Among the identified candidates, we further characterized the microRNA-145 (mir-145),
whose expression was very low in MPM tissues and cell lines, as compared to benign
mesothelial tissues or untransformed mesothelial cells. Mir-145 may represent a potential
tumor suppressor, since its expression has been found downregulated in a number of solid
tumors, including prostate and bladder tumors, endometrial adenocarcinomas and gliomas
(11–14). The homeodomain-containing transcription factor OCT4 is among the multiple
targets of mir-145 (13, 15). The OCT4 gene (also named POU5F1) plays an important role
in activating self-renewal gene programs in embryonic tissues and stem cells(16). OCT4 is
found overexpressed in poorly differentiated and high-grade tumors, with potential to

support aberrant proliferation, tumor initiation and chemoresistance (17–21). These
properties have been shown to reside in its ability to control Epithelial to Mesenchymal
transition (EMT)(22) as shown in mouse models of metastatic colon cancer (23). In fact,
RNAi-based downregulation of OCT4 in vitro affects growth and tumorigenicity of ovarian
cancer cell lines (24). We found here that mir-145 has the potential to modulate many in
vitro pro-tumorigenic features of MPM cells, including growth, clonogenicity and resistance
to pemetrexed treatment. Additionally, transfection of mimic-145 into MSTO-211H cells
strongly reduced tumor engraftment in vivo. Induction of replicative senescence accounted
for the clonogenic death induced by the treatment of MPM cells with mir-145 agonists.
Mir-145 directly targeted OCT4 and, indirectly, its EMT-promoting target ZEB1 in MPM
cells and the levels of mir-145 and OCT4 inversely correlated in vivo. OCT4 targeting is
crucial to the anticancer properties of mir-145. In fact, mimic-145 expression counteracted
the increase of OCT4 in pemetrexed resistant MPM cells. Additionally, overexpression of
OCT4 at least partially rescued the effects of mimic-145 on the clonogenicity and replicative
senescence of the targeted MPM cells. Promoter hyper-methylation may contribute the low
levels of mir-145 in MPM cells and malignant MPM tissues. In summary, in this work, we
have identified mir-145 downregulation as a characteristic trait of malignant vs benign
mesothelial tissues. Additionally, we provide insights into the possible contribution of
mir-145-OCT4 interaction to the transformed phenotype of MPM cells.

RESULTS

Identification of microRNAs differentially expressed among malignant and benign
mesothelial tissues (Fig.1)

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We performed an unbiased microRNA screening of MPM specimens (n= 29) and
mesothelial benign tissues (mesothelial cysts, n=12). In Table I the main histoclinical
features of cysts and MPMs are reported. As expected by the reported incidence distribution
of mesothelioma subtypes in Western populations (25) more than 80% of cases were
represented by the epithelioid mesothelioma (Table 1). All the analyzed specimens derived
from surgically resected, naïve –treated patients. Our analysis revealed striking differences
in the microRNA expression profile of benign vs malignant mesothelial tissues and allowed
us to identify a discrete number of microRNAs (n=19) which showed statistically significant
opposite modulation in benign vs malignant tissues (Fig. 1A, heat map). PCA analysis
confirmed the ability of the 19 selected microRNAs to discriminate between the benign and
malignant tissues. This was particularly evident on the first component, accounting for
42.24% of the total variance (Fig. 1B). Among the differentially expressed microRNAs, a
larger fraction showed higher levels in benign lesions (n= 13) while a restricted number
showed strong downregulation in the malignant tissues (n=6)(Fig. 1A). We focused on
microRNA-145 (mir-145), because it showed the highest intensity values in its subgroup and
because its modulation in our samples suggested the potential to act as a tumor suppressor.
Additionally, mir-145 has been recently shown to modulate EMT, a key feature of MPM(26,
27).

We validated the previous results in two ways. Firstly, we assessed the levels of mir-145 by
quantitative PCR on unmatched MPM and pleural biopsies obtained from patients (n=20, of
which 6 MPM and 14 benign tissue) not belonging to the first set analyzed (Fig. 1C). As
shown by the box plot (Fig 1C), we found that mir-145 expression was significantly
downregulated in this validation group, thus confirming our initial findings. Secondly, we
assessed the mir-145 levels in snap-frozen matched pair samples (n=36) of peritoneal
mesothelium vs MPM (Fig. 1D). This, again, revealed that mir-145 levels were significantly
lower in the matched tissues (p<0.001)(Fig. 1D). In summary, our analysis revealed a
statistically significant downregulation of mir-145 levels in MPM as opposed to the benign
tissues, irrespectively whether the latter was derived from cysts, normal mesothelium or
peritoneal mesothelium from the same patient (Fig. 1). Mir-145 downregulation was
observed in both paraffin-embedded MPM material and from snap-frozen sections.
Additionally, the analyzed specimens were derived from three independent institutions (see
discussion), thus strengthening further our results. To facilitate a functional characterization
of mir-145 in MPM, we tested whether mir-145 downregulation was conserved in
representative MPM cell lines as well (Fig. 1E). Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis showed
that mir-145 expression was deeply downregulated in three MPM cell lines (MSTO-211H,
NCI-H2052 and NCI-H28) when compared to untransformed mesothelial cells (HMC) (Fig.
1E). Of note, the MPM cell lines were different both in histologic type (epithelioid,
sarcomatoid, byphasic) and growth properties (ATCC.org). This suggests that mir-145
downregulation is independent of MPM type and that our in vitro system could recapitulate
what observed in the initial microRNA screening of the patient samples (Fig. 1 and table 1).
Therefore, we decided to use the mentioned MPM cell lines to characterize the effect of
mir-145 downregulation on MPM cells.
Re-expression of mir-145 affects viability and clonogenicity and migration of the MPM cell
lines (Fig.2)

The broad downregulation of mir-145 in the malignant mesothelial tissues (as compared to
the benign ones) suggested that mir-145 might act as a tumor suppressor. Therefore, we
hypothesized that increased levels of mir-145 could counteract some of the malignant
features of the MPM cell lines. To this aim, we transfected control- or mir-145 molecules in
MSTO-211H, NCI-H2052 and NCI-H28 MPM cell lines (Fig.2). Transfection of the
mir-145 agonist significantly affected the time dependent growth of all three tested MPM
cell lines (p<0.05)(Fig. 2A left panel). To detail the observed effect on cell growth, we
performed clonogenic assays from the same MPM cell lines (Fig. 2A middle and right
panels). The clonogenic assay is useful to assess the long-term in vitro tumorigenic capacity
of transformed cells in a way independent of acute toxic effects due to liposome
transfection. This revealed a strong inhibition of colony forming ability in the cell lines
transfected with mir-145, as compared to control-transfected cells (Fig. 2A middle and right
panels, p<0.05).
Finally, we evaluated the effect of mir-145 transfection on the migratory properties of MPM
cells. Transwell cell migration assays revealed that the migration of NCI-H2052 and

MSTO-211H transfected with mir-145 was strongly reduced, as compared to controltransfected counterparts (Fig 2B, left and right panels, p<0.05). Inhibition of cell migration
was also observed by scratch assays as well at early time points (Suppl. Fig. 1, left and right
panel). We could not test the NCI-H28 cell line in this experimental context, since the latter
cells did not show significant migratory properties at steady state (unpublished
observations). Altogether, these observations revealed that forced expression of mir-145 in
transformed mesothelial cells affects three protumorigenic features, namely cell growth,
clonogenicity and cell migration. Further, to evaluate if the observed effects of mir-145 reexpression would translate in anticancer effects in vivo, we performed xenograft
experiments. SCID mice were subcutaneously transplanted with MSTO-211H cells
transfected with either ctrl- or mimic-145 16hrs before injection (fig. 2C). No differences in
cell viability were observed in the two groups of injected cells at time of injection. We
observed a significant inhibition of tumor growth in the mice engrafted with mimic-145
transfected cells. In fact, we observed tumor formation (cut off: volume >150mm3) in 8/8
mice injected with ctrl- transfected cells and in 2/8 mice injected with mimic-45 transfected
cells (p<0.05) (fig. 2C). Additionally, the tumors grown from mimic-145 transfected
MSTO-211H were significantly smaller than those grown from their control-transfected
counterparts (p<0.05) (Fig.2C).

A closer look at the colonies formed by control- and mimic-145 transfected cells as from
Fig. 2A, revealed that the in the mimic-145 expressing cells the colonies were composed of
bigger, flat cells and showed reduced cell density, reminiscent of a senescent cell phenotype.
Therefore, we investigated whether re-expression of the mir-145 in transformed MPM cell
lines could trigger senescence. SA-β–galactosidase staining (at pH 6) of both MSTO-211H
and NCI-H2052 cells transfected with ctrl or mimic-145 revealed strong staining in most of
the cells expressing mimic-145, with no or little staining observed in the control cells at 5
days after transfection (Fig. 3A upper and lower panel p<0.05). To provide further evidence
for the induction of replicative senescence by mir-145 overexpression, we evaluated by
Western Blotting the levels of lamin B1, acetylated Histone H3 (AcH3K9) and p21 protein
in ctrl- and mimic-145 treated MSTO-211H and NCI-H2052 cells. This revealed a
significant reduction of both lamin B1 and AcH3K9 and induction of the p21 proteins in
both mesothelioma cell lines transfected with mimic-145 (as compared to ctrl-transfected
cells)(Fig. 3B). Lastly, we observed increased formation of senescence-associated
heterochromatin foci (SAHF) in the mimic-145 transfected cells (Fig. 3C). SAHF are
specialized domains of facultative heterochromatin, known contribute to senescenceassociated cell growth arrest by sequestering and silencing proliferation-promoting genes.
All the observed changes are strongly suggestive of replicative senescence (28–33).
Altogether, these observations support the idea that mir-145 expression induces senescence
in MPM cells and that induction of replicative senescence may mediate the anti-clonogenic
effects of mimic-145 transfection.
Mir-145 targets OCT4 in MPM cells (Fig. 4)

investigate which gene products could mediate its effects. Literature mining and in silico

analysis with multiple target finding algorithms revealed several targets of mir-145 with
relevance for cancer development (unpublished observations). We focused on OCT4
because of its involvement in modulating aggressive features of solid tumors (19, 20, 23).
We and others have previously shown that increased OCT4 levels correlate with the
resistance of mesothelioma cells to pemetrexed in vitro (34, 35). In addition, the acquisition
of an hypermigratory phenotype is a main feature of transformed cells and requires the
reactivation of pathways governing the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)(36).
Initially, we confirmed targeting of the OCT4 3’UTR region by mir-145 by assessing the
luciferase activity of HEK293 cells co-transfected with a double luciferase reporter (whose
activity was driven by the OCT4 3’ UTR) and a mir-145 expression vector (Fig. 3A). This
revealed that transfection of the mir-145 significantly affected the translation of the
luciferase mRNA in the targeted cells, as shown by a drop of the enzyme activity (Fig 3A).
Additionally, such effect was specific for mir-145, since it was abolished in cells transfected
with a mutant 3’UTR construct unable to bind to mir-145 (Fig 3A). Next, we analyzed by
western blotting the protein levels of OCT4 in control-vs mimic-145 transfected
MST0-211H and NCI-H2052 cells. Our analysis revealed that mir-145 overexpression
affected the protein levels of OCT4 (Fig. 3B upper panels). We also tested the effect of
mimic-145 on exogenously expressed OCT4 in both MPM cell lines, by transfecting an
OCT4 expression vector harboring a wt 3’UTR (37) in mimic-145 treated cells. This
confirmed a specific decrease of the exogenously expressed OCT4 protein in the mimic-145
transfected cells (Fig.3B lower panels). Further, we confirmed the downregulation of OCT4
by staining MSTO-211H (and NCI-H2052) cells co-transfected with GFP and mimic-145
with anti-OCT4 antibodies (Fig.3 C). This in fact showed a significant drop of OCT4
staining in the (GFP-positive) mimic-145 transfected cells (Fig. 3C, p<0.05).
Downregulation of OCT4 per se is compatible with the biological effects of mimic-145 we
observed in vitro, with regard to the inhibition of cell growth, migration and clonogenicity
(Fig. 2) In fact OCT4 has been recently shown to control the expression of pivotal EMT
promoting genes, including ZEB1, whose expression is relevant for MPM progression (26).
Western blotting analysis of lysates derived from control- and mimic-145 transfected cells
revealed in fact significantly lower levels of ZEB1 protein in both mimic-145 treated
MSTO-211H and NCI-H2052 cells (Suppl. Fig. 2). Lastly, we performed FACS staining of
ctrl- and mimic-145 transfected MSTO-211H and NCI-H2052 cells (Fig. 4D). This revealed
that mimic-145 transfection strongly reduced the number of OCT4-positive cells (8.94% ±
2.2 vs 1.94 ± 0.8% for ctrl- and mimic-145 transfected cells, respectively) (Fig. 4D, upper
and lower panel), therefore mirroring the previous results. In summary, mimic-145 treatment
of MPM cell lines affected the levels of endogenous OCT4 as well as the levels of the
exogenously expressed protein.

Mir-145 and OCT4 expression levels inversely correlate in vivo (Fig. 4E)
Since the forced expression of mir-145 triggers OCT4 downregulation, we predict that lower
mir-145 levels may correlate with increased expression of OCT4 in vivo. To verify this, we
performed immunohistochemistry staining for OCT4 of paraffin embedded sections derived
from the same samples used for our initial microRNA screening (Fig. 1A), for which the
levels for mir-145 were previously determined (Fig 1A). This showed that, as compared to
the reference benign tissues (cysts), the levels of OCT4 were higher in all the MPM samples

ranging from 21–89% positive cells vs 18% in the cyst (Fig. 4-E.). Additionally we found a
significant correlation between the extent of mir-145 downregulation and the number of
OCT4 positive cells (Fig. 4E-linear regression analysis: r: 0.77; r2: 0.59; p value <0.01),
thus enforcing the relevance of mir-145 targeting of OCT4.
OCT4 antagonizes the miR-145 -mediated suppression of MPM protumorigenic features
(Fig.5)

Author Manuscript

To correlate the anti-cancer effects of mimic-145 with its activity toward the OCT4 gene
product, we hypothesized that mimic-145 may antagonize the increase of OCT4 induced by
pemetrexed treatment. In fact, we and others have shown that emergence of chemoresistant
clones within pemetrexed and cisplatin-treated MPM cell lines is linked to the upregulation
of EMT and stemness-related genes, including OCT4 (34, 35). Therefore, we evaluated the
ability of mimic-145 to affect the levels of OCT4 in pemetrexed treated cells. FACS staining
of ctrl- and mimic-145 transfected MSTO-211H cells treated with pemetrexed revealed in
fact a significant increase of the number of OCT4 positive cells in the ctrl-transfected ones
(Fig. 5A, left panel) (as compared to vehicle treated cells-fig. 4B). This effect was strongly
reduced in their mimic-145 transfected counterparts (Fig. 5A, right panel) (24.94 ± 2.3 vs
6.22 ±1.1%, respectively).Similar results were obtained when using NCI-H2052 cells (data
not shown). Additionally, we performed western blotting analysis with anti-OCT4
antibodies of lysates derived from the same cells as in fig. 5A: this revealed a significant
decrease of OCT4 induction in MSTO-211H cells transfected with mimic-145 and treated
with pemetrexed as compared to the similarly treated, ctrl-transfected cells(Fig. 5B). Based
on these results, we predicted that overexpression of OCT4 could counteract the tumorsuppressive properties of the mimic-145. To this aim, we transfected control – or mimic-145
treated MSTO-211H and NCI-H2052 cells with an OCT4 expressing vector (or with an
empty vector) and we evaluated the properties of the transfected cells (Fig.5B–C). We found
that exogenous expression of OCT4 (and not that of the empty vector-EV) significantly
attenuated the effect of mimic-145 on the clonogenicity of the transfected cells. In fact,
mimic-145 +OCT4 transfected cells formed significantly more colonies than their control
counterparts (Fig. 5C, p<0.05). Further, we evaluated the effect of OCT4 overexpression on
the extent of cell senescence induced by the expression of mimic-145 (Fig. 5D). This
revealed a significant reduction of the number of SA-β-Galactosidase positive cells in the
OCT4 + mir-145 expressing cells as opposed to the EV+mir-145 transfected cells (Fig. 5D,
p<0.05). In summary, these observations further strengthen the physical and functional
relevance of the mir-145-OCT4 interaction. Our observations are also reminiscent of
previous work showing the potential for OCT4 overexpression to bypass the senescence of
human primary breast cells (38).

Promoter methylation may contribute to mir-145 silencing in MPM cell lines (Fig. 6)
We have found the levels of mir-145 downregulated in neoplastic mesothelial tissues and
MPM cell lines, as opposed to benign tissues and untransformed mesothelial cells,
respectively. We next investigated how the levels of mir-145 could be downregulated in
tumor samples. Therefore we investigated the methylation status of all the DNA CpG
islands represented within the regulatory regions of the mir-145 promoter (Fig. 6A). We
performed pyrosequencing assays on normal and malignant mesothelial tissues, respectively

(Fig. 6B, upper and lower panels). This showed a general decrease of DNA methylation in
all CpG islands analyzed (within the mir-145 promoter), in the mesothelia as compared to
the mesothelioma tissues (average methylation: 46% ± 7% vs 83% ± 3%, for mesothelium
vs mesothelioma, respectively, p<0.01) (Fig. 6C). The difference in methylation was even
more evident for the CpG islands located closer to the transcription start site (Fig. 6B upper
and lower panels). Further, we analyzed the methylation of the same CpG islands in
MSTO-211H and NCI-H2052 cells treated with either vehicle or 5-Azacytidine (5AZA-10uM, 96hrs), a DNA demethylating agent currently tested in clinical trials for
myelodisplastic syndromes (MDS)25. 5’AZA treatment is expected to counteract the
transcriptional repression due to promoter DNA hyper-methylation. This revealed a dramatic
change in the methylation status of the CpG islands in the cells treated with 5’AZA (Suppl.
Fig.3A and 3B) which readily matched the increase of mir-145 levels as assessed by
semiquantitative PCR (Suppl. Fig. 3C). These observations support the idea that increased
DNA methylation may be responsible for the low levels of mir-145 in both mesotheliomas
and mesothelioma cell lines.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We investigated whether specific microRNAs could distinguish a large group of
mesotheliomas from benign mesothelial lesions cysts, pleura or peritoneum. To reduce a
possible “single-institution bias” in the sample collection, the specimens used for both the
screening and the validation have been independently derived from different institutions, all
reference centers for mesothelioma therapy, and analyzed with two different platforms. The
use of mesothelial cysts as normal control tissues is unprecedented. Mesothelial cysts are
relatively rare structures composed of normal pleural or peritoneal mesothelium which
develop as liquid-filled translucent fibrous walls lined by a single layer of mesothelial
cells(39). Therefore, mesothelial cysts may represent a valuable alternative to the use of
immortalized cell lines or non-mesothelial tissues as a control. In the experimental system
here used, we found that, with regard to mir-145 expression, all the sources of benign
mesothelial tissue (cysts, pleural mesothelium, peritoneum) behaved similarly. Our initial
screening has identified a number of microRNAs (n=19) whose levels of expression may
segregate benign from malignant mesothelial tissues. Notably, some of the microRNAs
identified in this study have been found by others and already shown to possess the power to
discriminate between lung adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma tissues (mir-141, mir-200c,
mir-193)(40). This represents an indirect biological validation of our findings. On the other
hand, some other microRNAs (mir-145, mir-204, mir-486-5p, mir-1287) have not been
described yet for mesothelioma, to the best of our knowledge. We have focused on mir-145
for its potential to act pleiotropically as a tumor suppressor via targeting multiple relevant
cancer genes (12, 41–48). We provide evidence here that hypermethylation of mir-145
regulatory region is responsible for the low levels of this microRNA in both malignant
mesothelial tissues and mesothelioma cell lines. We found that overexpression of mir-145
by mimic compounds affected the levels of OCT4 and, indirectly, of its EMT-associated
gene target, such as ZEB1. Both OCT4 and ZEB1 are intimately connected to the
maintenance of stemness, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and cancer chemoresistance
(18–20, 24). Mir-145 downregulation conveys clear protumorigenic advantages to

mesothelioma cells. Indeed, proliferation, clonal growth and migration of MPM cells are
readily reduced by the transfection of “mimic” compounds and in vivo tumorigenicity is
reduced as well. All this is unprecedented for MPM and shows how microRNA modulation
is complex and how a change in the levels of a single microRNA may affect multiple
pathways, impinging on key tumor features. EMT and chemoresistance are in fact major
determinants of mesothelioma development and progression (26, 35). Mir-145 has multiple
targets which are relevant to cancer progression. Although it is likely that multiple
mechanisms underlie the anticancer effects of mir-145 re-expression in MPM cell lines, our
observations suggest that OCT4 downregulation can be a main one. In fact, add-back of
OCT4 into mimic-145 treated MPM cells at least partially restores the clonogenicity of the
cells, while reducing significantly the number of senescent cells. These observations agree
with the data from Beltran et al., showing that lentiviral expression of OCT4 in human
mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) can “bypass” the spontaneous senescence occurring in
those primary cultures after few passages(38). Conversely, the pro-senescence effects of
mir-145 re-expression in MPM cells are reminiscent of the data from Bonifacio et al., (49)
showing mir-145 upregulation in senescent human fibroblasts. Induction of chemoresistant
cell populations is a side effect of pemetrexed and cisplatin treatment which limits their
efficacy in vivo. This is fuelled by cytokines and growth factors secreted by senescent MPM
cells in response to chemotherapy treatment, according to a Senescence Associated
Secretory Phenotype (SASP) model(35, 50–52). The resulting chemoresistant cells are
endowed with very high levels of EMT and stemness genes, including OCT4 and ZEB1(35).
Indeed, we show here that pemetrexed treatment induces OCT4 and increases the number of
OCT4 positive cells and the emergence of the latter cells may represent a mechanism of
tumor progression(35). Mimic-145 treatment may, at least partially, counteract this
phenomenon given its ability to downregulate OCT4 expression in pemetrexed treated
samples.

One unanswered question of this study is whether mir-145 may act as a part of a larger
group of microRNAs. In fact, we found that the distribution of the expression of mir-145 in
our collected samples was strikingly similar to that of other 5 microRNAs (Fig.1A).
Therefore, it is possible that all or some of the mentioned microRNAs may act as a
functional cluster by targeting converging pathways. This is supported by the fact that at
least some of the microRNAs identified in this study are known to target common EMTpromoting factors (for example, mir-141 and 200c target ZEB1/2)(53–55). In this regard, it
would be interesting in future work to investigate the relationship between mir-145 and the
other microRNAs sharing a similar distribution, to unravel possible functional interactions.
With regard to this, it is interesting that targeting of the ZEB1-EMT axis is a frequent
predicted function of the mentioned microRNAs (56). This reflects the prominent role of
these EMT players in MPM development(26, 27).

Materials and Methods
Sample collection
41 unmatched specimens (29 MPM and 12 mesothelial cysts) were collected from two
different institutions in Italy (Regina Elena Cancer Institute, Rome and General Hospital S.

Vincenzo, Taormina). All the specimens were from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded
tissues (FFPE) and initial diagnosis confirmed by expert histopatologists. 20 fresh biopsies
(14 normal pleura vs 6 MPM) were obtained from Regina Elena Cancer Institute. An
additional 36 snap-frozen samples (matched peritonea vs MPM) were used as a validation
set of the results obtained with the initial screening and derived from the New York
University Medical Center, New York, United States. The patients were not treated with any
previous radio or radio-chemotherapy, before to undergoing surgery. Independent Ethical
Committees from all the Institutions have approved the use of the samples.
RNA extraction, labeling and microarray hybridization

Author Manuscript

RNA from FFPE samples and cell lines was extracted using the miRneasy® FFPE kit
(QIAGEN) and TRIZOL, respectively, following the manufacturer’s instructions. TRIZOL
was used for the extraction of snap-frozen tissue specimens as well. Total RNA (200 ng)
coming from tissues was labeled and hybridized to Human miRNA Microarray V2 Rel.16
(Agilent). Scanning and image analysis were performed using the Agilent DNA Microarray
Scanner (P/N G2565BA) equipped with extended dynamic range (XDR) software, according
to the Agilent miRNA Microarray System with miRNA Complete Labeling and Hyb Kit
Protocol manual. Feature Extraction Software (Version 10.5) was used for data extraction
from raw microarray image files using the miRNA_105_Dec08 FE protocol. For the
matched peritonea vs MPM samples, samples were extracted with TRIZOL and 5ug of Total
RNA was processed as described elsewhere (57).
microRNA expression profiling and data analysis

Author Manuscript

Analysis of expression of 887 human microRNAs were performed using in house built
routine by Matlab (The Mathworks Inc.). Signals were pre-processed with quantile
normalization and log2 transformed. Samples with duplicates available were tested for
quality control. Unpaired T-test and Wilcoxon test were used to identify differentially
expressed features between mesothelioma samples and cysts. Deregulated miRNAs with
pvalue less than 0,001 and FDR (False Discovery Rate) less than 0,05 were selected.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and Principal Component Analysis were used to
separate different subgroups of samples basing on the identified signature. Validation of the
signature was obtained by RT-PCR.
Target Prediction
Diana mirPath (http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/pathways) using Targetscan 5 and Pictar was
used for the in silico putative target prediction of the selected microRNAs.
