Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) is a well-studied oncogene for its role in tumorigenesis
and serves as a marker of malignancy in several cancer types including lung. In the present study,
we defined the role of PTTG in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell migration and induction of
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the regulation of integrin αVβ3-FAK signaling
pathway. Overexpression of PTTG through an adenovirus vector resulted in a significant increase
in the expression of integrins αV and β3, a process that was reversed with the down-regulation of
PTTG expression through the use of an adenovirus expressing PTTG-specific siRNA. Western
blot analysis of cells infected with adenovirus PTTG cDNA resulted in increased FAK and
enhanced expression of adhesion complex molecules paxillin, metavincullin, and talin.
Furthermore, downstream signaling genes Rac1, RhoA, Cdc42, and DOCK180 showed upregulation upon PTTG overexpression. This process was dependent on integrin αV as blockage by
antagonist echistatin (RGD peptide) or αV-specific siRNA resulted in a decrease in FAK and
subsequent adhesion molecules. Actin cytoskeleton disruption was detected as a result of integrinFAK signaling by PTTG as well as enhanced cell motility. Taken together our results suggest for
the first time an important role of PTTG in regulation of integrins αV and β3 and adhesion
complex proteins leading to induction of EMT.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Integrins are a super family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors responsible for
cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. A total of 18 α and 8 β subunits of
integrins have been identified, which non-covalently bind to form 24 distinct transmembrane
heterodimers, each with a specific, non-redundant function (Hynes, 2002). Specificity of an
integrin in interacting with an extracellular ligand is determined by heterodimer composition
of α and β subunits. The integrin αVβ3 binds to arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)
containing compounds of the ECM such as vitronectin and fibronectin (Orlando and
Cheresh, 1991), as well as blood and cell surface proteins (Ruoslahti, 1996). Integrins not
only can trigger cytoskeletal rearrangements within the ECM but also connects to the
cellular cytoskeleton through the actin-based microfilament system to mediate signals for
the control of diverse cellular functions including survival, proliferation, differentiation,
adhesion, and migration leading to changes in gene expression through outside-in signal

transduction (Giancotti and Tarone, 2003; Hynes, 2002). This is accomplished with the aid
of scaffolding proteins such as talin, vinculin, paxillin, and α-actinin as well as kinases
(Berrier and Yamada, 2007). At least three kinases are activated through integrin-mediated
cell attachment: focal adhesion kinase (FAK), protein kinase C (PKC), and Src (Berrier and
Yamada, 2007; Ruoslahti, 1994), which modifies downstream signaling. FAK is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase (Parsons, 2003) that binds to the cytoplasmic tail of the
integrin β-subunit via its SH3 domain located on the N-terminal tail (Huveneers et al., 2008;
Schaller et al., 1995). The C-terminal tail of FAK contains protein-protein interaction sites
that span ~100 amino acids (Martin et al., 2002). NMR and x-ray crystallography analysis
show that this region contains a four-helix bundle that can be found on other adhesion
proteins (Arold et al., 2002; Hayashi et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2002). Paxillin is activated by
tyrosine phosphorylation and has been shown to be associated with the regulation of
cytoskeletal organization, focal adhesion formation, cell migration, and cell motility (Petit et
al., 2000; Turner, 2000). In addition to binding to integrins, vinculin also binds to the Nterminus of paxillin as well as actin. Binding of vinculin to actin is believed to contribute to
the formation of structural links between integrin proteins and the actin cytoskeleton (Ezzell
et al., 1997).

Metastasis is a physiological process in which tumor cells detach from the primary tumor,
travel via the bloodstream to distance sites, invade, and form secondary tumors. This is
accomplished through changes in cell polarity, which causes the tumor cells to lose cell-tocell contact and exchange their epithelial markers for mesenchymal (Thiery, 2003), a
process known as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT),which is a key program
during the embryonic development but has more recently been implicated in cancer invasion
and metastasis (Firrincieli et al., 2010; Thiery, 2003). Changes in cell polarity is
accomplished through the loss of E-cadherin expression (Christiansen and Rajasekaran,
2006; Schmalhofer et al., 2009) and cell junction proteins, and coupled to the gain of
mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and N-cadherin (Agiostratidou et al., 2007; Blanco
et al., 2004). Changes in the expression and function of certain integrins, such as β1, has
been implicated in cancer (Zuk and Hay, 1994). These polarity changes and resulting
cellular focal adhesion changes enhance the ability of cells to migrate and invade the ECM,
which is considered a functional hallmark of the EMT process (Christiansen and
Rajasekaran, 2006; Danen et al., 2002).

Pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) also known as securin regulates chromosomal
segregation under normal physiological conditions (Kumada et al., 1998; Zou et al., 1999).
PTTG was initially cloned from rat pituitary tumor cells as a 974 bp mRNA that encodes a
199 amino acid protein, which is not expressed in the normal pituitary (Pei and Melmed,
1997). Subsequently, PTTG was cloned from the adult testes and embryonic liver (Kakar
and Jennes, 1999; Lee et al., 1999). PTTG is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors
including lung, ovary, uterine, pituitary, thyroid, liver, brain, and renal clear cell carcinoma
(Chamaon et al., 2005; Cho-Rok et al., 2006; El-Naggar et al., 2007; Heaney and Melmed,
1999; Honda et al., 2003; Tang et al.; Tsai et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 1999). Furthermore,
cloning and sequencing of PTTG isolated from tumors shares sequence homology with that
isolated from human testes cDNA, suggesting that it is overexpression and not mutation that
contributes to its oncogenic properties (Zou et al., 1999). Overexpression of PTTG is
capable of stimulating cell proliferation in HEK293 and inducing cellular transformation in
vitro using NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells as well as promotes tumor development in nude mice
showing its tumorigenic potential without necessitating a partner oncogene (Hamid et al.,
2005; Kakar and Jennes, 1999; Pei and Melmed, 1997). A 60% reduction of PTTG protein
using siRNA in the lung cancer cell line H1299 showed inhibited colony formation using a
soft agar assay and reduced xenograft tumor formation in nude mice (Kakar and Malik,
2006), furthermore demonstrating the role of PTTG in tumor growth and progression. In

addition, a relationship between PTTG levels and cancer metastasis have been reported in
several cancer types (Liang et al.; Shibata et al., 2002; Solbach et al., 2004; Yan et al.,
2009). PTTG overexpression has also been shown to increase matrix-metalloproteinase 2
(MMP-2) expression and secretion resulting in increased cell migration and invasion to
promote metastasis (Malik and Kakar, 2006). However, the relationship between PTTG and
integrins αV and β3 in the promotion of actin cytoskeleton alternations through focal
adhesion complex formation has not been explored. In the present study, we investigated the
role of PTTG in regulation of integrins αV and β3 expression and the adhesion complex
assembly to trigger alteration of the actin cytoskeleton and promote EMT in lung cancer
cells.

Results
Overexpression of PTTG results in increased expression of integrins αVβ3, FAK, p-FAK
and associated adhesion complex proteins paxillin, metavincullin, talin, Rac1, RhoA,
Cdc42, and DOCK180

Adhesion complex formation is essential for rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton for
enhanced cell motility. In the present study, we used in vitro experiments to understand the
molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of the focal adhesion complex by PTTG
through the activation of integrins αVβ3 and subsequent activation of the FAK signaling
pathway. For this purpose we generated an adenovirus expression system to over express
PTTG cDNA (Ad-PTTG cDNA) and an adenovirus expressing PTTG siRNA (Ad-PTTG
siRNA) to down-regulate the expression of PTTG. Human non-small cell lung carcinoma
cell line H1299 and adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cancer cell line A549
were selected to determine if these changes in expression were localized to a particular cell
type or represented lung cancer in a broader sense. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
analysis of PTTG mRNA showed a significant increase in expression upon infection of both
A549 (Fig. 1A) and H1299 (Fig. 1C) cell lines with Ad-PTTG cDNA as compared to
uninfected cells or cells infected with control Ad-GFP. Overexpression of PTTG was further
confirmed by performing immunofluorescence analysis of both A549 and H1299 cells,
which showed a significant increase in immunoreactive protein in Ad-PTTG cDNA infected
cells compared to uninfected or cells infected with the control vector Ad-GFP (Fig. 1B, D).

Integrins are the family of heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors shown to be
overexpressed in different tumors and tumor cell lines including lung cancer (Chen et al.,
2005). To determine if PTTG regulates the expression of commonly expressed integrins αV
and β3 in cancer, we overexpressed PTTG in A549 and H1299 cells by infecting the cells
with Ad-PTTG cDNA and analyzed the expression of αV and β3 integrins using qPCR,
which showed a significant increase in mRNA expression of both integrins αV and β3 (Fig.
2A, B). In addition, FACS analysis using the specific antibody for αVβ3 showed a
significant increase in αVβ3 in cells infected with Ad-PTTG cDNA compared to uninfected
cells or cells infected with Ad-GFP (Fig. 2C, D). In contrast, down regulation of PTTG by
using Ad-PTTG siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of expression of
integrins αV and β3 (Fig. 2A, B), suggesting regulation of expression of αV and β3 integrins
by PTTG. Consistent with these findings, immunofluorescence analysis of A549 and H1299
cells for integrin αVβ3 revealed a significantly higher level of protein expression for αVβ3
in both cell lines infected with Ad-PTTG cDNA compared to uninfected cells or cells
infected with Ad-GFP (Fig. 2E, F).
Tumor cell adhesion and migration, mediated by members of the integrin family, are linked
to tumor cell growth and malignancy. Once ligated, integrins have several adhesion complex
associated signaling molecules that mediate their biological function, such as FAK, leading
to anchorage-independent survival and proliferation (Reddig and Juliano, 2005; Westhoff et
Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 December 28.

al., 2004). As PTTG influences expression of integrins αVβ3, we investigated the effect of
overexpression of PTTG on the phosphorylation and activation of FAK. Interestingly, we
found that overexpression of PTTG in both A549 and H1299 cells resulted in an increase in
the mRNA expression of total FAK compared to uninfected cells or cells infected with AdGFP (Fig. 3A, B). Increased expression of FAK was again confirmed by Western blotting.
Both A549 (Fig. 3C,) and H1299 cells (Fig. 3D) showed a significantly higher level of FAK
protein expression when infected with Ad-PTTG cDNA compared to uninfected cells and
cells infected with Ad-GFP. As FAK is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that becomes
tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently activated when integrins adhere to various matrix
proteins, leading to increased cell migration (Zheng et al., 1999),we therefore investigated if
PTTG-induced αVβ3 resulted in increased phosphorylation of FAK in lung cancer. Western
blot analysis of phosphorylated FAK (p-FAK) showed an increase in level of p-FAK in
response to increased total FAK in both A549 and H1299 cell lines upon Ad-PTTG cDNA
infection compared to uninfected cells or cells infected with Ad-GFP (Fig. 3C, D). In
response to phosphorylation, immunofluorescence of p-FAK showed localization to the
cellular membrane upon treatment with Ad-PTTG cDNA (Fig. 3Eii), indicative of increased
focal adhesion complex assembly.

Additional adhesion complex molecules include talin, paxillin, and metavincullin (Ross,
2004). These signaling molecules interact with each other to produce adhesion dependent
responses (Nishiya et al., 2001). In the case of lung cancer using A549 cells, PTTG
overexpression resulted in a significantly higher level of expression of paxillin,
metavincullin, and talin (Fig. 4A). Paxillin itself has several downstream signal transduction
molecules including Rac1, RhoA, Cdc42, and DOCK180 (Valles et al., 2004). These
molecules play important roles in migration and cell matrix adhesion (Danen et al., 2002).
To fully understand their roles in mediating the function of integrins αVβ3 in response to
overexpression by PTTG, we studied the expression of these molecules by qPCR. A549
cells infected with Ad-PTTG cDNA showed a higher level of mRNA expression for each
Rac1, RhoA, Cdc42, and DOCK180, compared to uninfected cells or cells infected with
control Ad-GFP (Fig. 4B).
Knockdown of integrin αV by αV siRNA results in decreased mRNA expression of its
adhesion associated complex molecules paxillin, metavincullin, talin, Rac1, DOCK180,
RhoA, and Cdc42

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To confirm the role of PTTG in the induction of EMT through the activation of integrin αV,
we knocked-out integrin αV mRNA by using siRNA (αV siRNA). Down regulation of
integrin αV was confirmed by using immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 5A). Infection of
A549 cells with Ad-PTTG cDNA along with co-transfection using αV siRNA showed a
significant decrease in mRNA expression of paxillin and metavincullin (Fig. 4A).
Additionally, the downstream targets of paxillin, Rac1, RhoA, Cdc42, and DOCK180 were
also down regulated (Fig. 4B), verifying the role of integrin αV in the assembly of the
adhesion complex. Furthermore, down regulation of DOCK180 upon treatment with αV
siRNA was confirmed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 5B).
Effect of knockdown of integrins αVβ3 by RGD peptides on expression of p-FAK
Activation and phosphorylation of FAK by ECM-integrins is an important phenomena for
the cells to achieve migratory phenotype (McLean et al., 2005). In the present study, to
investigate the potential role of PTTG in the induction of EMT through the activation of
integrins and FAK pathway, we infected A549 and H1299 cells with Ad-PTTG cDNA or
Ad-GFP and treated with echistatin, a specific RGD peptide, to block the activation of
integrins. After 48 hr of total treatment, cells were harvested and protein extracts were
analyzed for p-FAK and total FAK by western blot analysis. Both A549 and H1299 cell

lines when infected with Ad-PTTG cDNA and RGD peptide showed a similar level of pFAK to untreated cells (Fig.3C, D), indicating that RDG was able to block the effect of
PTTG-induced FAK expression.
Effect of knockdown of integrin αV by siRNA on cell migration
A549 cells were infected with Ad-PTTG cDNA or Ad-GFP control vector and cotransfected with αV siRNA or control siRNA. A wound was formed by scrapping away the
cells and the cells were examined after 24 hr of wound formation. Overexpression of PTTG
with and without control siRNA showed nearly complete healing of the wound after 24 hr
compared to uninfected and Ad-GFP infected cells, which had fewer cells migrated into the
gap (Fig. 6A). However, addition of αV siRNA significantly impaired the cells ability to
migrate (Fig. 6A), suggesting that integrin αV is crucial to mediate the function of PTTG in
tumor cell migration.
Actin cytoskeletal organization

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In A549 cells, it has been shown that EMT leads to increased migratory and invasive
abilities, which are characterized by re-organization of actin cytoskeleton through
destruction and cellular protrusion formation (Keshamouni et al., 2006). To determine the
role of PTTG in actin cytoskeletal reorganization, we infected A549 cells with Ad-PTTG
cDNA and after 48 hr, cells were stained for F-actin and vinculin. Cells infected with AdPTTG cDNA showed morphological changes including formation of protrusions and
destruction of actin filaments compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 6B), indicating a potential
role of PTTG in the induction of EMT.
Expression of EMT markers E-cadherin and vimentin
To verify the induction of EMT, we tested the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin
and mesenchymal marker vimentin in A549 and H1299 cells on infection of cells with AdPTTG cDNA for 48 hr. In both cell lines, overexpression of PTTG resulted in a significant
decrease in E-cadherin and increase in vimentin compared to Ad-GFP or untreated cells
(Fig. 7), demonstrating the role of PTTG in the induction of EMT.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a physiologic process that allows
morphological and genetic changes of carcinoma cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal
phenotype. During EMT process, epithelial cell surface proteins that mediate cell-to cell
contact, such as E-cadherin, are replaced by mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and
vimentin, which provides more transient adhesive properties (Micalizzi et al., 2010).
Numerous inducers of EMT in cancer cells have been identified including transforming
growth factor-β (TGF-β), Wnt/β-catenin, Snail/Slug, Twist, and talin (Becam et al., 2005;
Huber et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2002; Savagner et al., 1997; Yang et al., 2004; Zavadil and
Bottinger, 2005). These factors have been reported to be critical as repressor of E-cadherin
resulting in induction of EMT during developmental (Mercado-Pimentel and Runyan, 2007;
Taneyhill et al., 2007). PTTG itself has been shown to increase cell proliferation and
tumorigenesis in HEK293 cells, while mutation of PTTG decreased tumorigenesis (Hamid
et al., 2005). In addition, down regulation of PTTG in lung cancer cells resulted in reduced
colony formation and tumor formation in nude mice (Kakar and Malik, 2006). While PTTG
can alter expression of MMP-2 (Malik and Kakar, 2006), co-expression of integrin αVβ3
with MMP-2 resulted in MMP-2 activation and correlated with progession of melanoma
(Hofmann et al., 2000). Our results show that PTTG can act as an inducer of EMT by
altering expression of E-cadherin and vimentin as well as integrin-mediated focal adhesion
complex formation to alter the actin cytoskeleton. Adherin junctions incorporate the actin

cytoskeleton allows the cells to “hold hands” and link cell to cell across the entire tissue,
enabling a sheet of epithelial cells to move and function as a single cell (Vaezi et al., 2002).
Therefore, changes in the actin cytoskeleton are a prerequisite for cell migration and
invasion (Yilmaz and Christofori, 2009), and thus transition between an early stage
neoplasm that is localized to the primary site to a late stage where metastasis has occurred.
In addition to E-cadherin expression, alterations in the expression of integrins has been
implicated in malignant transformation, tumor progression, and metastasis (Mizejewski,
1999). Integrins αVβ3 has been shown to be frequently overexpressed in tumor cells,
including lung cancer, melanoma, glioblastoma, and breast cancer (Chen et al., 2005;
Gladson and Cheresh, 1991; Rolli et al., 2003; Seftor et al., 1992). High level of expression
of many integrins has been correlated with tumor progression and metastasis including
α5β1, α6, and αVβ3 (Gong et al., 1997; Hofmann et al., 2000). In addition, mice treated with
intetumumab, a monoclonal antibody to integrin αV, significantly reduced lung metastasis in
A549 non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model (Ning et al., 2010). In the present study
we demonstrated the potential role of PTTG in induction of EMT through the promotion of
integrins αVβ3. Overexpression of PTTG resulted in a significant increase in level of
integrins αV and β3 mRNA and protein (Fig. 2A–B, 3). In contrast down regulation of
PTTG resulted in a reversal of the effects at both the mRNA and protein level (Fig. 2A–B),
clearly demonstrating the involvement of PTTG in the induction of EMT through increased
expression of integrin αVβ3. Thus this regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. No
significant change in expression of other integrins such as α5, α6 or β1 was observed
(Supplement Figure 1), indicating that αV and β3 probably are the main integrins in
mediating the function of PTTG.

Integrin signaling is depending on the formation of adhesion complexes that includes both
adaptor/scaffolding proteins as well as kinases that provide enzymatic activity (Berrier and
Yamada, 2007). Proteins involved in adhesion complex formation include talin, paxillin,
vinculin, α-actinin, FAK, and Src that interact either directly or indirectly to affect adhesion
dependent responses (Playford and Schaller, 2004). Src interacts via its SH3 domain with
integrin β3 to activate FAK signaling to promote tumor growth leading to cytoskeleton
driven morphological changes (Huveneers et al., 2008). In addition to integrins, soluble
growth factors also promote FAK activation, and thereby, FAK integrates growth factor
receptor- and matrix-derived signals to elicit biological responses, including the induction of
a migratory phenotype (McLean et al., 2005). FAK–Src complex has been shown to
promote the phosphorylation of many FAK-associated Src substrates including CAS,
paxillin, and p190RhoGAP, which have a central role in the reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton and migration (Playford and Schaller, 2004). So far several studies have
reported the role of FAK signaling in the induction of EMT (Deng et al., 2010; Ponnusamy
et al., 2010; Wendt et al., 2010). In our present study, we observed that overexpression of
PTTG resulted in a significant increase in the total level of FAK and p-FAK (Fig. 3).
Interestingly, knockout of integrins αVβ3 by using RGD peptide resulted in a significant
decrease in the total level of FAK protein (Fig. 3) As a result of increased integrin and FAK
expression by PTTG, we found a significant increase in the expression of adhesion complex
proteins paxillin, metavincullin, and talin (Fig. 4A). Subsequent downstream molecules
Rac1, RhoA, Cdc42, and DOCK180 were also overexpressed an effect which was reversed
with the down regulation of integrin αV (Fig. 4B). The small GTPases Rac1, RhoA, and
Cdc42 have been implicated in regulating the assembly and disassembly of the actin
cytoskeleton (Altun-Gultekin et al., 1998; Berrier and Yamada, 2007; Klemke et al., 1998;
Nakashima et al., 1999) while Cdc42-induced filopodia act as precursors for Rac-induced
lamellipodia, establishing an integrin-dependent Rho GTPase activation in the regulation of
cell spreading and migration (Guillou et al., 2008). DOCK180 has been shown to function as
a guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) factor for Rac to increase cell motility and enhance
invasion (Jarzynka et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2010), a crucial step in the EMT process.

Studies have shown that integrins αVβ3 and α5β1 differentially regulate RhoA activity in
response to fibronectin binding (Danen et al., 2002). Consistent with our results,
overexpression of integrins αVβ3 and subsequent overexpression of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42
as a result of PTTG overexpression leading to enhanced cell migration (Fig. 6A) and actin
cytoskeleton destruction (Fig. 6B) as a step in induction of EMT.

Conclusion
In the present study we have demonstrated for the first time the potential role of PTTG in the
induction of EMT through the activation of integrin αVβ3 and its associated focal adhesion
kinase pathway (Fig. 8).

Materials and methods
Generation of plasmid and adenovirus constructs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The full length PTTG cDNA, PTTG siRNA, and control siRNA were sub-cloned into
adenovirus shuttle vector (pShuttle). Positive clones were sequenced to confirm the
orientation and authenticity of sequence as described previously (Panguluri and Kakar,
2009). The adenovirus expression systems were generated and purified in association with
the Virus Vector Core Facility, Gene Therapy Center, University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
Cell culture and infection of cells with adenovirus expressing PTTG cDNA, GFP or PTTGsiRNA
Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line H1299 and adenocarcinomic human alveolar
basal epithelial cancer cell line A549 were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA). The cell lines were routinely sub cultured every 3–4 days.
For infection of cells with adenovirus, cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 hr, cells
were infected with adenovirus expressing PTTG cDNA (Ad-PTTG cDNA), adenovirus
expressing GFP (Ad-GFP), control siRNA (Ad-control siRNA) or PTTG-specific siRNA
(AdPTTG siRNA) as described previously (Panguluri and Kakar, 2009).
Western blot analysis

Cells were plated in 6-well plates and infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-PTTG cDNA and treated
with 100 nm echistatin (RGD peptide) after 24 hr of infection to block integrin αVβ3. After
48 hr of infection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in chilled lysis buffer [50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 1 mM NaF]
supplemented with Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular
Biochemical, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Protein was quantitated using BSA as a standard.
Equal amount of protein (40 µg) from each sample was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel
and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ,
USA). Blots were probed with anti-FAK or anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr397) from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) at a dilution of 1:1,000 in Tris-buffered saline
(pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized
using the Enhanced Chemiluminescent Detection system (ECL) kit from GE Health System
(Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to instructions provided by the supplier. The membrane
was stripped by using western blot stripping reagent (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and
reprobed with GAPDH antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) to
normalize the variation in loading of samples.

fixation for 1 hr. Cells were resuspended for analysis on a FACS Caliber cytometer and
analyzed with FlowJo software.
Preparation of total RNA, synthesis of first strand cDNA, and quantitative real-time PCR
After 48 hr of infection with appropriate adenovirus, cells were harvested and total RNA
was purified using trizol reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and as
described previously (El-Naggar et al., 2007). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the
iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) using 1 µg total RNA according to manufacturer’s
protocol.

The real-time PCR reaction mixture was prepared in a Light Cycler® 480 (Roche
Diagnostics) Multiwell 96 wells plate containing 1 µM of each primer, 10 µl of 2X master
mix and 1µl of cDNA template, in a final reaction volume of 20 µl. The real-time PCR
amplification was performed using the specific primers for PTTG, integrin αV, integrin β3,
FAK, paxillin, metavincullin, talin, RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, and DOCK180 (Table 1) using the
following cycle parameters: enzyme activation at 95°C for 10 min; 45 cycles of 95°C for 10
s, 63°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 10 s. Following the amplification phase, a cooling step was
performed at 40°C for 10 s (ramp rate of 1.5°C/s). Acquisition of the fluorescence signal
was performed using the Mono Hydrolysis Probe setting (483–523 nm) following the 72°C
extension phase of each cycle. GAPDH primers were included to normalize variation from
sample to sample. All experiments were repeated three times using three independent
preparations of cDNA.
Wound migration assay
Cells were treated with Ad-GFP or Ad-PTTG cDNA for 48 hr prior to wound formation.
Wounds were formed by scraping away the cells and replacing the media. Cells were
examined after 24 hr of wound formation.
Cytoskeleton organization analysis
Actin cytoskeleton staining was carried out by using Actin Cytoskeleton and Focal
Adhesion staining kit purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA, USA). Briefly, cells were
cultured in chamber slides and infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-PTTG cDNA. After 48 hr of

infection, cells were fixed with 4.0% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and then
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. After washing twice
(5–10 min each) with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20), followed by
incubation with blocking solution (PBS containing 1% BSA) for 30 min. Cells were then
incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with anti-vinculin at a dilution of 1:300. After two
successive washes, cells were then exposed to corresponding FITC-conjugated secondary
antibody at a dilution of 1:500 for 60 min at room temperature. For double labeling, cells
were simultaneously incubated with TRITC-conjugated Phalloidin at the dilution of 1:1 000
to map the local orientation of actin filaments. After washing of cells with washing buffer,
nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (diluted 1:500) for 20 min at room temperature
followed by three washes (5–10 min each) with washing buffer. The cells were then
mounted with aquapolymount antifade solution (Sigma) and observed under an Olympus
IX50 fluorescence microscope or using a MRC 600 laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad).
Statistical analysis
Data comparing differences between two groups were statistically analyzed using unpaired
Student’s t-test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.
