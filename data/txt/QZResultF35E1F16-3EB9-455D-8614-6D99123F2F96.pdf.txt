ABSTRACT
The guanine-rich sequences are able to fold into G-quadruplexes in living cells,
making these structures promising anti-cancer drug targets. In the current study, we
identified a small molecule, Ber8, from a series of 9-substituted berberine derivatives
and found that it could induce acute cell growth arrest and senescence in cancer cells,
but not in normal fibroblasts. Further analysis revealed that the cell growth arrest was
directly associated with apparent cell cycle arrest, cell senescence, and profound DNA
damage at the telomere region. Significantly, our studies also provided evidence that
Ber8 could stabilize endogenous telomeric G-quadruplexes structures in cells. Ber8
could then induce the delocalization of TRF1 and POT1 from the telomere accompanied
by a rapid telomere uncapping. These results provide compelling insights into direct
binding of telomeric G-quadruplexes and might contribute to the development of more
selective, effective anticancer drugs.

recombination by a T-loop, which forms through strand
invasion of the 3′-overhang into the duplex part of the
telomere [7]. The T-loop is stabilized by a six-subunit
protein complex called shelterin, containing TRF1,
TRF2, POT1, TIN2, TPP1, and Rap1. Among them,
TRF1, TRF2, and POT1, directly recognize TTAGGG
repeats [8]. G-quadruplex small molecular ligands have
the ability to interfere with telomere function in multiple
ways: the ligands can inhibit telomerase activity by
blocking the binding of telomerase with G-overhang [9];
the ligands can dissociate the shelterin protein complex
from the telomere and lead to telomere uncapping and
degradation [10–12]; and the ligands can interfere
with telomere replication by impairing replication fork
progression [13, 14]. Several types of G-quadruplex
ligands can counteract the extension of telomere in
anticancer therapy [15–17]. However, challenges still
exist in developing G-quadruplex ligands because of the
non-validated target location and insufficient drug-like
properties.

INTRODUCTION
Guanine-rich nucleic acids have the ability to fold
into a four-stranded secondary structure known as a
G-quadruplex, and novel anti-cancer therapy strategies
binding and stabilizing these structures have attracted
significant attention in recent years. The availability of
a new G-quadruplex antibody, BG4, for quantitatively
visualizing G-quadruplexes in both cancer cells and
tissues has enhanced the attractiveness of this strategy
[1, 2]. Some studies on G-quadruplex’s ligands in living
cells also highlight the potential for binding and stabilizing
G-quadruplexes in cells [3, 4].
The human telomeric DNA contains repetitive
TTAGGG sequences in the overhang; these repeats can
form G-quadruplex structures [5]. This G-overhang acts
as a substrate for the catalytic subunit of telomerase,
which is a reverse transcriptase with an RNA component
required for telomere extension [6]. The telomere
terminus is protected from degradation or illegitimate

Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated
from Chinese herbs, has shown anticancer potential
against a wide range of human cancer cells and minimal
cytotoxicity in normal cells [18–21]. Berberine and its
derivatives could bind directly with the G-quadruplex
by external stacking to G-tetrad [22–24] and have poor
selectivity for duplex DNA [25]. 9-substituted berberines
with longer side chains and terminal amino groups were
previously synthesized by our group and were found to
have significant telomeric G-quadruplex-binding ability
and improved selectivity compared to berberine [26–29].
In the present study, we firstly applied several screening
methods to evaluate the interaction of our in-house library
of berberine derivatives (Supplementary Figure S1) with
telomeric G-quadruplexes and to identify a promising
ligand. We found that Ber8, a newly synthesized berberine
derivative with a side chain of chlorohexyl group at
the 9-position, had strong interaction with telomeric
G-quadruplexes and could effectively induce acute cell
growth arrest in cancer cells. Moreover, the inhibition of
cancer cell growth by Ber8 was associated with apparent
cell cycle arrest, cell senescence, and profound DNA
damage at telomere regions. Further mechanic studies
revealed that Ber8 could not only increase endogenous
telomeric G-quadruplexes in cancer cells but also
delocalize TRF1 and POT1 from the telomere and induce
telomere uncapping.

ability and selectivity of berberine derivatives with
telomeric G-quadruplex DNA (HTG22) and hairpin DNA
by using SPR. After fitting the original data from SPR,
the binding constants (KD) could be calculated. As shown
in Supplementary Figure S2B and Supplementary Table
S1, most of the compounds demonstrated strong binding
abilities with the HTG22, with the exception of BBR, ber1
to ber7, and ber9. The KD values of the effective ligands
were at a level of 10–5 to 10–6 mol/L. More importantly,
the effective compounds possessed good selectivity for the
HTG22 against the hairpin DNA. Due to their effective
stabilization and selective binding ability, compounds Ber8
and ber10 - ber22 were chosen for further investigation.
To identify effective G-quadruplex ligands with
anti-tumor activity, MTT assays that assess cytotoxicity
were applied. Human cervical tumor cells Siha,
human non-small cell lung cancer cells A549, human
promyelocytic leukemia cells HL60, and normal human
cells BJ were tested. We found that Ber8 exhibited the
strongest inhibitory effects on the tumor cells and a weak
inhibitory effect on normal cells (Figure 1A). Therefore,
the compound Ber8 may be a good candidate for further
cellular studies, and BBR was used as a compound
control. The structure of Ber8 and BBR were shown in
Figure 1B.

G-quadruplex DNA by Ber8 in vitro

RESULTS

The interaction between Ber8 and the telomeric
G-quadruplex was further examined by using CD
spectroscopy and FRET assays. In the absence of
potassium, sodium, or any other cations, the CD spectrum
of randomized HTG21 oligonucleotide had a negative
peak at 238 nm, a major positive peak at 257 nm, a minor
negative peak at 280 nm, and a positive peak at near 295
nm (Figure 2A, black line). Titration of Ber8 into HTG21
induced the formation of an antiparallel G-quadruplex
in a dose-dependent manner, exhibiting minor positive
peak at 240 nm, a negative peak at 265 nm, and a major
positive peak at 295 nm (Figure 2A). In addition, as shown
in Figure 2B, Ber8 could enhance the melting temperature
(Tm) of HTG21 in dose-dependent manner but did not
increase the Tm value of the hairpin duplex DNA (F10T).
Combining with the previous data, Ber8 could selectively
bind and stabilize the telomeric G-quadruplex vs. duplex
DNA. As a control, BBR could only induce a weak
increase on Tm of either the HTG21 DNA or the F10T
DNA (data not shown).

Screening of effective berberine derivatives as
G-quadruplex ligands for cancer cell treatment
To evaluate the interaction between berberine
derivatives and G-quadruplexes, FRET assays were
firstly applied. FRET can evaluate the thermo-stability of
telomeric G-quadruplex DNA (HTG21). The structures
of the berberine derivatives were listed in Supplementary
Figure S1. The changes in melting temperatures (ΔTm)
of the G-quadruplex DNA were calculated from the
original FRET data and shown in a column graph
(Supplementary Figure S2A). All the derivatives
exhibited stabilizing effects on the HTG21 oligomer
(the ΔTm values ranged from 5°C ~ 22°C). This finding
was agreed with our previous reports that introduction
of a side chain (especially with a positively charged
aza-aromatic terminal group) on the 9-position of the
berberine can lead to significant increased stabilization of
G-quadruplex DNA [26–28]. In addition, if 10°C of ΔTm
was set as a threshold to determine effective G-quadruplex
stabilization, the derivatives ber7 to ber22 could be
selected as G-quadruplex stabilizers.
In addition to the effect on the thermo-stability
of DNA, the binding of compounds to DNA is also
an important parameter for identifying an effective
G-quadruplex ligand. We further evaluated the binding

The effects of Ber8 on cell proliferation in 48 h were

of cells with increasing concentrations of Ber8 led to a

remarkable arrest of cell growth in a dose-dependent manner
in Siha and HL60 cells, but not in A549 and BJ cells (Figure
3A). The half-concentrations of inhibition (IC50) of Ber8 on
these cells were 28.8 ± 1.0 μM (BJ), 6.0 ± 0.9 μM (Siha), 1.7
± 0.5 μM (HL60), and 18.6 ± 1.3 μM (A549), respectively.
The cellular uptake amounts of Ber8 were shown in
Supplementary Table S2. Ber8 could be taken up by these
cells, the uptake amounts varied from different cells. In brief,
the uptake amounts was highest in HL-60 cells, the uptake
amounts in Siha was higher than those in A549 cells. Thus,
the different inhibitory effects of Ber8 on different cells might
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

come from different uptake efficiency. In addition, the growth
inhibitory effects of Ber8 were largely improved compared
with BBR (Supplementary Table S3).
To evaluate the effects of Ber8 on the proliferation of
cancer cells and normal somatic cells over a relatively longterm period, subcytotoxic concentrations (0.15, 0.3, and
0.6 μM) of Ber8 were used to treat Siha cells, HL-60 cells, and
BJ fibroblasts, respectively. After 16 days of treatment, growth
arrest could be observed in both Siha cells and HL-60 cells at
0.6 μM (Figure 3B and 3C). In contrast, BJ cells treated with
Ber8 at the same concentration demonstrated little change

in cell growth (Figure 3D). BBR exhibited a much weaker
inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cancer cells (Figure
3B and 3C). These results showed that Ber8 could effectively
and selectively inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.
To further examine the effects of Ber8 on cellular
events, we applied a panel of cellular assays on Siha and
HL60 cells. Firstly, a flow cytometry assay determining
the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was
conducted. As shown in Figure 4A, after treatment with
Ber8, Siha cells in the sub-G1 phase showed an observable
increase from 4.4% to 15.6%, and cells in the G2/M
phase increased from 19.1% to 37.5%. Simultaneously,
an obvious decrease of cells in the G0/G1 phase from
64.6% to 33.5% was also observed. On the other hand,
Ber8 tended to accumulate the sub-G1 and S phase of HL60 cells (Figure 4B). As a control, BBR did not show a
significant effect on the cell cycle. These results suggested
that Ber8 induced a cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M phase
along with the inducement of a sub-G1 peak.
The accumulation of cells in the S-G2/M phase is
usually due to the induction of a DNA damage and repair
pathway [30]. For this reason, we examined the related

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathway induced by Ber8 by using Western blot. As shown
in Figure 4C and 4D, Siha and HL60 cells treated with Ber8
for 48 h induced a dose-dependent increase of phosphorylated
ATM (p-ATM), phosphorylated p53 (p-p53) and
phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX). These findings indicated
the happening of DNA damage and repair with the upregulation of p-ATM and p-p53. Moreover, Ber8 decreased
the primary transcription factor C-MYC in a dose-dependent
manner. C-MYC can influence on the process of multistage
cancer development, and its down-regulation can promote
apoptosis and senescence [31]. Additionally, P21 and P27,
the key downstream regulators of cell cycle arrest and cellular
senescence [32, 33], were also increased by Ber8.
In addition, long-term treatments of Siha and HL-60
cells with Ber8 led to apparent senescence, with larger cell
size, vacuolated cytoplasm, and β-galactosidase activity
(Figure 4E). The percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells
reached the significant values of 71.9% and 91.4% in Siha
cells and HL-60 cells, respectively (Figure 4F). However,
BJ fibroblasts displayed a healthy, normal morphology after
treatment with Ber8 and did not present any β-galactosidase
activity. Together, these results demonstrated that the

double immunofluorescence experiments to investigate
whether the DNA damage induced by Ber8 was at
telomere region. A significant increase in γH2AX foci
(with a mean of 62 foci per nucleus) was observed
after treatment with Ber8 for 24 h (Figure 5A and
5B), indicating that Ber8 induced DNA double-strand
breaks. To verify whether γH2AX was activated at the
telomeres, we quantitatively analyzed the co-localization
of γH2AX with TRF2, which formed the so-called
telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) [35]. We
found that treatment with Ber8 significantly increased
the TIFs, with a mean of 41 TIFs per nucleus (Figure 5A

and 5C). More importantly, about 66% of γH2AX foci
were co-localized to TRF2. The TRF2 foci maintained
in 24-h treatment (Supplementary Figure S3). These
results suggested that the DNA damage stimulated by
Ber8 occurred largely at the telomeric region.
Whether Ber8 could stabilize or change the
number of endogenous telomeric G-quadruplexes
was further investigated using the BG4 antibody,
which was used for quantitative visualization of DNA
G-quadruplexes in human cells [1]. Strikingly, 24-h
treatment with Ber8 induced a significant increase of
BG4 foci in the nucleus, with a mean of 65 BG4 foci
per nucleus (Figure 5D and  5E), indicating that Ber8
could increase the amount of G-quadruplexes in vivo.
Moreover, to track whether the compound stabilized
telomeric G-quadruplexes, double immunofluorescence
experiments were also performed to stain both BG4 and
TRF2. As shown in Figure 5D and 5F, the co-localization
of BG4 and TRF2 protein was considerably increased
by Ber8 (with a mean of 37 foci per nucleus) compared
with that of the control cells (with a mean of 19 foci
per nucleus). Approximately 58% of BG4 foci were
co-localized to TRF2, suggesting the inducement of
endogenous telomeric G-quadruplex structures in living
cells by Ber8.

Considering that stabilization of the G-quadruplex
in the telomeric region may result in the dissociation of
telomere binding protein and telomere uncapping [36], we
next investigated the effects of Ber8 on the dissociation
of telomere-binding proteins, including POT1, TRF1 and
TRF2, which directly recognized telomere TTAGGG
repeats. Double immunofluorescence experiments
demonstrated that TRF1 and POT1 expression highly
overlapped with that of TRF2 in Siha control cells
(Figure 6A and 6B). 48-h treatment with Ber8 specifically
delocalized TRF1 and POT1 (but not TRF2) from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm (Figure 6A and 6B). Quantitative
analysis the percentage of nuclei with more than 4
TRF1/TRF2 and POT1/TRF1 co-localizations revealed
a significant reduction to 25.4% ± 3.4% and 25.9% ±
3.1%, respectively, after Ber8 treatment (Figure 6C). The
dissociation of hTERT was not observed in Ber8-treated
cells (data not shown). These results demonstrated that
Ber8 strongly dissociated POT1 and TRF1 proteins from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
One current model proposes that telomeres form ‘a
cap’ at the end of chromosomes [7] and that alterations in

telomere protein binding may lead to telomere uncapping,
with the formation of anaphase bridges and polynucleated
nuclei [37–39]. After staining nuclei with DAPI, typical
images of multiple or polynucleated nuclei were observed
in Siha cells treated with 0.62 μM Ber8 for 16 days
(Figure 6D). Specifically, 24.0% of the nuclei examined
(n = 200) was observed in Ber8-treated cells, compared
with 1% for the controls. Moreover, typical images
of anaphase bridges were found in Ber8-treated cells
(Figure 6D) at a proportion of 29.5% compared with
0% for the controls. All the above data supported our
hypothesis that Ber8 could stabilize endogenous telomeric
G-quadruplexes and lead to telomere DNA damage and
telomere end uncapping.

developed a series of 9-substituted berberine derivatives
to stabilize G-quadruplexes [26–29]. Here we took
some further screening and mechanic studies basing
on our in-house berberine derivatives library. Ber8 was
found with a significant selective anti-tumor activity on
several cancer cells. Since mechanic studies indicated
the effects of Ber8 on cancer cells mainly through its
binding with G-quadruplex at telomere region, one of
the reasons for cellular selectivity might come from
the different basal level of DNA damage in telomere
region of cancerous cells and normal cells [44], or the
basal level of G-quadruplex varies in tumorous cells and
normal cells [2]. However, this hypothesis still needs
further exploration.
We also found Ber8-induced dissociation of
telomere-binding proteins from the telomeres and
translocation of these proteins from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm. These binding proteins include single-stranded
binding protein (POT1) and double-stranded binding
protein (TRF1). We were curious about whether Ber8
could affect conformational switch of double-stranded
TTAGGG repeats. The result of S1 nuclease digestion
assay was shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Doublestranded DNA (dsHTG21) could not be digested by S1
nuclease while G-quadruplex DNA (HTG21) could
be digested. After incubation with Ber8, the dsHTG21

DISCUSSION
G-quadruplex-stabilizing small molecules derived
from polycyclic alkaloid structures are potent telomerestabilizing agents in vitro and induce senescence or
apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines [40–42].
Compounds that contain polycyclic alkaloids often
exhibit improved solubility and can facilitate salt
formation, which are important for oral absorption and
bioavailability [43]. Using the favorable polycyclic
skeleton of berberine to our advantage, our group has

exhibited significant digested bands in a dose-dependent
manner. The results indicated that G-quadruplex structure
might be induced by Ber8 in the double-stranded region.
This finding was consistent with one current model
that stabilization of telomere G-quadruplex may lead
to alterations of telomere protein binding and telomere
uncapping and, thus, cause DNA damage at the telomere
[12, 36]. However, shortening of telomere length was not
observed (Supplementary Figure S5), which was similar
to other G-quadruplex ligands, such as telomestatin
[36], NiP [37] and RHPS4 [38]. Possible reasons for this
may include the survival advantage of cells with drugundamaged telomeres during culture passages or that
telomere uncapping induced two important DNA repair
pathways that mend broken chromosomes: homologydirected repair (HDR) and nonhomologous endjoining
(NHEJ) [7, 45].
In summary, we found an effective anti-tumor
berberine derivative Ber8 that demonstrated an effect on
several cellular events, including cell cycle arrest, DNA
damage and repair, and cell senescence. Furthermore, in
vitro and in vivo studies indicated that this compound
could bind with the G-quadruplex structure in telomere
ends and, thus, cause the dissociation of shelterin proteins,
which might be the main mechanism in the anti-tumor
action of the compound.

SPR measurements were performed on a ProteOn®
XPR36 Protein Interaction Array System (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using a Neutr Avidin-coated
NLC sensor chip. In a typical experiment, biotinylated
HTG22 (5′-d(AGGG[TTAGGG]3)−3′) and duplex DNA
(5′-T9CGAATTCGT5CGAATTCG-3′) were folded in a
filtered and degassed running buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.4, 100 mM KCl). The DNA samples were then captured
(∼1,000 RU) in flow cells, and a blank cell was set as a
control. Ligand solutions (at 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and
20 μM) were prepared within the running buffer by serial
dilutions from stock solutions. Six concentrations were
injected simultaneously at a flow rate of 25 μL/min for
5 min for associating, followed by 5 min of disassociation
at 25°C. The NLC sensor chip was regenerated with a short
injection of 1 M KCl between consecutive measurements.
The final graphs were obtained by subtracting blank
sensorgrams from the duplex or quadruplex sensorgrams.
The data were analyzed with ProteOn® manager software,
using the Langmuir model to fit the kinetic data.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
A final concentration of 5 μM HTG21
(5′-d(GGG[TTAGGG]3)−3′) oligomers was re-suspended
in a CD buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) with varying
amounts of compounds and incubated for 5 min.
The CD spectra were recorded on a Chirascan® CD
spectrophotometer (Applied Photo-physics, UK) at 25°C.
A quartz cuvette with a 4-mm path length was used for the
spectra recorded over a wavelength range of 230–400 nm
at a 1-nm bandwidth, 1-nm step size, and 0.5-s per point.
A buffer baseline was collected in the same cuvette and
subtracted from the sample spectra. Final analysis of the
data was conducted using Origin 8.0 (OriginLab Corp.).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis and characterization
All chemicals were obtained from commercial
sources unless otherwise specified. All HPLC purified
oligomers were purchased from Invitrogen (China), and
the concentration was determined from its absorbance at
260 nm based on its molar extinction coefficients (ε260).
The structure, synthesis route and characterization of
the compounds were listed in the supplementary data
(Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Scheme S1).

Cell culture
The human cervical cancer cell Siha, human lung
cancer cell A549, human promyelocytic leukemia cell HL60, and BJ fibroblasts were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and
preserved at our lab. HL-60 cells were cultured in a RPMI1640 medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA), and other
cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (D-MEM, Gibco Carlsbad, CA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were cultured with
5% CO2 at 37°C.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
FRET assays were performed following previously
described methods. 5′-FAM and 3′-TAMRA dual labeled
F21T (5′-d(GGG[TTAGGG]3)-3′) at a final concentration
of 0.2 μM were incubated with diverse concentrations of
compounds in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) containing
60 mM KCl at 37°C for 1 h. The fluorescence melting
curves were determined within a Roche LightCycler2®
real-time PCR machine. Fluorescence readings with
excitation at 470 nm and detection at 530 nm were taken
at intervals of 1°C from 37 to 99°C, with a constant
temperature maintained for 30 s prior to each reading
to ensure a stable value. Final analysis of the data was
conducted using Origin 8.0 (OriginLab Corp.).

of compounds. After 48-h or 96-h treatment, 20 μL of
2.5 mg/mL methylthiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) solution
was added to each well, and the cells were further
incubated for 4 h. The cells in each well were then treated
with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (100 μL per well), and
the optical density (OD) was recorded at 570 nm. All
experiments were parallel performed in triplicate, and the
IC50 values were derived from the mean OD values of the
triplicate tests versus the drug concentration curves.

(PVDF) membranes. The blots were blocked with 3% BSA
for 2 h at 25°C and then probed with primary antibodies
(1:1,000) at 4°C for 16 h. After three washes, the blots
were subsequently incubated with the corresponding
secondary antibodies (1:3,000) for 2 h at 25°C. The
protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence
substrate, and images were acquired using a Tanon4200SF gel imaging system (Shanghai, China). Antibodies
to β-actin (#4970, Cell Signaling Technology, MA,
USA), Phospho-ATM (Ser1981) (#5883, Cell Signaling
Technology), Phospho-p53 (Ser15) (#9286, Cell Signaling
Technology), γH2AX (#9718, Cell Signaling Technology),
C-MYC (#9402, Cell Signaling Technology), P21(#2947,
Cell Signaling Technology), P27(#3686, Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (#7074, Cell Signaling
Technology), and anti-mouse IgG-HRP (#7076, Cell
Signaling Technology) were used.

Long-term cell culture
Long-term proliferation experiments were con­
ducted using Siha, HL60, and BJ cells. The cells were
grown in culture dishes at 5.0 × 105 per dish and were
exposed to compounds at subcytotoxic concentrations or
an equivalent volume of 0.1% DMSO every four days.
The cells in the control and drug-exposed dishes were
counted, and the flasks were reseeded with 5.0 × 105
cells. The process was repeated until a growth platform
appeared.

Immunofluorescence
Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min, then permeabilized
with 0.1% triton-X100/PBS at 37°C for 30 min, and
finally blocked with 5% goat serum/PBS at 37°C for 3 h.
Immunofluorescence was performed using standard
methods, and the slides were incubated alternately
with BG4 (80 ng/μL), anti-FLAG antibody (#2368,
Cell Signaling Technology), γH2AX antibody (#9718,
Cell Signaling Technology), TRF2 antibody (ab13579,
Abcam), or POT1 antibody (ab21382, Abcam) at 37°C
for 3 h. The glass coverslips were washed six times
with blocking buffer and were then incubated with
anti-rabbit Alexa 488-conjugated antibody (A21206,
Life Technology), anti-mouse Alexa 555-conjugated
antibody (A21427, Life Technology), and 2 μg/mL of
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen) at
37°C for 3 h. The glass coverslips were again washed six
times with blocking buffer, and then, digital images were
recorded using an LSM710 microscope (Zeiss, GER) and
analyzed with ZEN software. Fifty nuclei were counted
in each group, and the s.e.m. was calculated from three
replicates. Frequency distribution graphs were plotted
using GraphPad Prism (GraphPadSoftware Inc.).

Senescence analysis
After completion of the long-term cell culture, the
growth medium was aspirated, and the cells were fixed
by 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at
room temperature. The fixing solution was then removed,
and the cells were gently washed with PBS twice.
The cells were then stained using β-Gal stain solution
containing 1 mg/mL of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-Dgalactoside and were incubated at 37°C overnight. The
staining solution was then removed, and the cells were
washed three times with PBS. The cells were viewed and
photographed under an optical microscope.

Flow cytometric analysis
The cells treated with compounds or control
medium were washed in PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol,
then centrifuged and re-suspended in a staining solution
(50 μg/mL PI, 75 KU/mL RNase A in PBS) for 30 min at
room temperature in dark. Cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry using an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, USA). For each analysis, 13,000 events were
collected. The cell cycle distribution was analyzed by
EXPO32 ADC software.

Anaphase bridge analysis
After the long-term cell culture, the growth
medium was aspirated, and the cells were fixed in 2%
formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room
temperature. The fixing solution was removed, and the
cells were gently washed twice with PBS and then stained
with 2 μg/mL of DAPI at 37°C for 3 h. The cells were
washed with PBS twice, and digital images were recorded
using LSM710 microscope (Zeiss, GER) and analyzed
with ZEN software. The frequency of anaphase bridges
was calculated as the ratio between cells exhibiting

Western blotting
The cells treated with compounds or control medium
were collected and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Bioteke,
China), and the protein concentrations were determined
using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, U.S.A.). In total, 60
μg of protein was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE and was
transferred to 0.22-μm immobilon polyvinyl difluoride
