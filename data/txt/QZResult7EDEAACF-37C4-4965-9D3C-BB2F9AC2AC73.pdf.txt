Abstract
NF-E2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major cytoprotective gene and is a key chemopreventive target against
cancer and other diseases. Here we show that Nrf2 faces a dilemma in defense against 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP), a
major human bladder carcinogen from tobacco smoke and other environmental sources. Although Nrf2
protected mouse liver against ABP (which is metabolically activated in liver), the bladder level of N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl (dG-C8-ABP), the predominant ABP–DNA adduct formed in bladder cells and
tissues, was markedly higher in Nrf2þ/þ mice than in Nrf2/ mice after ABP exposure. Notably, Nrf2 protected
bladder cells against ABP in vitro. Mechanistic investigations showed that the dichotomous effects of Nrf2 could
be explained at least partly by upregulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Nrf2 promoted conjugation
of ABP with glucuronic acid in the liver, increasing urinary excretion of the conjugate. Although glucuronidation
of ABP and its metabolites is a detoxification process, these conjugates, which are excreted in urine, are known to
be unstable in acidic urine, leading to delivery of the parent compounds to bladder. Hence, although higher liver
UGT activity may protect the liver against ABP, it increases bladder exposure to ABP. These findings raise
concerns of potential bladder toxicity when Nrf2-activating chemopreventive agents are used in humans
exposed to ABP, especially in smokers. We further show that 5,6-dihydrocyclopenta[c][1,2]-dithiole-3(4H)-thione
(CPDT) significantly inhibits dG-C8-ABP formation in bladder cells and tissues but does not seem to significantly
modulate ABP-catalyzing UGT in liver. Thus, CPDT exemplifies a counteracting solution to the dilemma posed
by Nrf2. Cancer Res; 71(11); 3904–11. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
NF-E2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a ubiquitous transcription
factor that stimulates the expression of genes involved in
many aspects of cytoprotection, most notably those for phase
2 enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Phase 2 enzymes catalyze detoxification
reactions of carcinogens and oxidants and thereby play
important roles in prevention of cancer and other diseases.

Indeed, Nrf2 knockout mice showed significantly increased
susceptibility to cancer (1), neurodegeneration (2), and inflammation (3). Nrf2 works by binding as a heterodimer with Maf
or other partners to a cis-acting DNA regulatory element,
namely the antioxidant response element, which is located in
the 50 -untranslated region of its target genes, and stimulating
gene transcription. Nrf2 is activated itself in response to
various stimuli, and chemopreventive and pharmacologic
agents activate Nrf2 through inhibition of Keap1-mediated
Nrf2 ubiquitination, which has been widely advocated as a
major strategy for prevention of cancer and other diseases.
4-Aminobiphenyl (ABP) from tobacco smoking and nonsmoking–related environmental and occupational exposure is
a well-known cause of human bladder cancer (4, 5). Tobacco
smoke is both the main cause of human bladder cancer and
the main source of human exposure to ABP (6, 7). In animal
studies, ABP causes both bladder and liver cancers (8).
Although ABP itself is not carcinogenic, it undergoes phase 1
metabolic activation in the liver to form N-hydroxy-ABP (NOH-ABP) which is eventually converted to the highly electrophilic arylnitrenium ion that causes DNA damage (9). DNA
damage has been shown to be fundamental to ABP-induced
bladder tumorigenesis. For example, ABP–DNA adducts were

Nrf2 Sensitizes Bladder to a Key Tobacco Carcinogen

detected in a high percentage of human bladder cancer
biopsies (10, 11); higher levels of ABP–DNA adducts in human
bladder tumors were associated with more aggressive behavior of the tumors (10); and treatment of animals with ABP
caused formation of DNA adducts before tumor formation (8,
12). Hepatic cytochrome P4501A2 was widely suggested to be
key to N-OH-ABP formation, but a subsequent study showed
that knockout of this gene in mice had no effect on ABP–DNA
adduct formation in the bladder (9). However, it is well known
that several phase 2 enzymes, including N-acetyltransferases
(NAT1 and NAT2) and UGT (comprising multiple isoforms),
attenuate the genotoxicity of ABP by catalyzing the conjugation of ABP or its metabolites with endogenous ligands acetylCoA and glucuronic acid, respectively. The conjugates are
generally more water soluble and hence more readily excreted.
Although there is no evidence that either NAT1 or NAT2 is
subjected to Nrf2 regulation, a number of UGT isoforms in
both humans and animals have been shown to be upregulated
by Nrf2 (13–15).
We recently found that sulforaphane, a naturally occurring
Nrf2 activator, inhibited ABP-induced DNA damage in bladder
cells and tissues, and that Nrf2 was essential for sulforaphane
to inhibit ABP–DNA adduct formation (16). Surprisingly, in
the absence of sulforaphane, Nrf2 promoted ABP–DNA adduct
formation in the bladder in vivo (16). In this study, we have
further examined the potentiating effect of Nrf2 on ABPinduced DNA damage and investigated the underlying molecular basis of this phenomenon. The data provided in this
report have a significant implication for cancer chemoprevention, as they reveal that bladder toxicity may occur if Nrf2activating chemopreventive agents are used in humans
exposed to ABP, such as smokers. Meanwhile, we also show
how the adverse effect of Nrf2 may be mitigated.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
5,6-Dihydrocyclopenta[c][1,2]-dithiole-3(4H)-thione (CPDT)
was synthesized as described previously (17). ABP, Nhydroxy-N-acetyl-4-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-AABP), and rat
liver S9 were purchased from Sigma, Midwest Research
Institute, and Moltox, respectively. An ABP-N-glucuronide
(ABP-G) standard was purchased from Toronto Research
Chemicals.
Cells
RT4 cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), stored in liquid nitrogen, and passaged
in our laboratory for fewer than 6 months. The cell line was
characterized by ATCC by antigen expression, DNA profile,
cytogenetic profile, and isoenzymes. RT4 cells were cultured
and treated with CPDT, ABP (plus 6% rat liver S9) or N-OHAABP as previously reported (16, 18). To silence Nrf2, cells were
treated with an Nrf2 siRNA or a control siRNA for 48 hours (18).
Mice
Male wild-type C57BL/6 mice (National Cancer Institute,
Frederick, MD) and their Nrf2-deficient counterparts (ref. 19;

www.aacrjournals.org

bred at our animal facility), 6 to 8 weeks of age, were injected
intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single dose of ABP or vehicle
(dimethyl sulfoxide) and sacrificed 24 hours later for quantification of N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl (dGC8-ABP) in the liver and bladder tissues (16). For CPDT
intervention, the mice were treated with CPDT (in soy oil)
or the vehicle by gavage once daily for 5 days; ABP was injected
3 hours after the last CPDT dose. To determine the effect of
CPDT on phase 2 enzymes by Western blotting, mice were
treated with CPDT by gavage once daily for 5 days and
sacrificed 24 hours later. Liver and bladder tissues were
removed immediately and stored at 80 C before use. To
measure urinary levels of ABP-G, mice were given a single dose
of ABP i.p. and immediately moved to metabolism cages (2
mice per cage) for 24-hour urine collection. The specimens
were stored at 80 C before analysis. All animal protocols and
procedures were approved by the Roswell Park Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee.
Measurement of dG-C8-ABP
dG-C8-ABP was quantified by capillary liquid chromatography and nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) as previously described (16, 20).
Western blot analysis
Cellular and tissue levels of Nrf2 and/or Nrf2 target genes
were measured by Western blotting as previously described
(18). All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, except for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) which was purchased from Millipore.
Measurement of liver UGT activity and urinary levels of
ABP-G and creatinine
The assay protocols for measuring liver UGT activity and
urinary ABP-G were based on those by Al-Zoughool and
Talaska (21), with some modifications. Briefly, livers were
homogenized in ice-cold 50 mmol/L potassium phosphate
buffer (pH ¼ 7.4) in a glass homogenizer. The homogenates
were cleared by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 9,100 g at 4 C.
UGT activity toward ABP was measured by a biochemical
assay coupled with reverse-phase high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). Each liver sample (0.35 mg protein)
was first incubated with 17.5 mg alamethicin in 0.171 mL of 50
mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH ¼ 7.4) containing
8.75 mL methanol on ice for approximately 20 minutes. The
entire mixture was then transferred to a final 0.2 mL reaction
solution, containing 50 mmol/L potassium phosphate (pH ¼
7.4), 10 mmol/L magnesium chloride, 5 mmol/L saccharalactone, and 0.5 mmol/L ABP (ABP was added in 4 mL methanol).
The reaction was initiated by adding 5 mmol/L UDP-glucuronic acid and continued for 30 minutes in a 37 C water bath.
The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 mL ice-cold methanol
to each reaction solution. A preliminary experiment showed
that the formation of ABP-G in the reaction was linear for at
least 45 minutes (data not shown). The solutions were then
centrifuged at 16,000  g for 3 minutes at 4 C, and the supernatants were analyzed by HPLC. HPLC analysis of urinary ABPG was carried out by using an Agilent system with a diode-array

Nrf2 potentiates ABP-induced DNA damage in bladder
tissues in vivo, but protects bladder cells against ABP in
vitro
Male C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks of age, both wild-type
and Nrf2 knockout) were given a single i.p. dose of ABP at
10 and 50 mg/kg; 24 hours later, ABP–DNA adduct levels in
bladder tissues were measured. dG-C8-ABP, which accounts
for 80% of all ABP–DNA adducts formed in human bladder
tissues in vivo (22, 23), was quantified by capillary liquid
chromatography and nanoelectrospray ionization–MS-MS.
ABP caused a marked and dose-dependent increase in dGC8-ABP formation in the bladder tissues of both wild-type
mice and Nrf2-deficient mice. However, bladder levels of dGC8-ABP were 2.4- and 2.7-fold higher in the wild-type mice
than in their Nrf2-deficient counterparts (Fig. 1A). Thus, Nrf2
significantly potentiated bladder DNA damage caused by ABP
in vivo. We wondered whether Nrf2 had a similar effect on ABP
in bladder cells in vitro. We previously showed that ABP and its
metabolite N-OH-AABP caused significant dG-C8-ABP formation in human bladder RT4 cells and other cells in vitro (16). NOH-AABP directly caused DNA damage, but ABP required rat
liver S9 for metabolic activation, because RT4 cells and other
bladder cells are apparently deficient in certain ABP-activating enzymes (16). N-OH-AABP rather than N-OH-ABP was
used because the latter was known to be highly unstable (24).
Nrf2 in RT4 cells was silenced by treatment with a Nrf2specific siRNA for 48 hours (Fig. 1B); these cells and the cells
similarly treated with a control siRNA were then exposed to
ABP at 0.5 mmol/L (plus 6% rat liver S9) or N-OH-AABP at 0.1
mmol/L for 3 hours. Treatment with these carcinogens for 3
hours was previously shown to lead to high levels of DNA
adduct formation (16). dG-C8-ABP levels in Nrf2-silenced cells
were 1.9-fold higher in the case of ABP and 1.8-fold higher in
the case of N-OH-AABP than in control cells (Fig. 1C). Thus,

phosphate (pH ¼ 6.8) and methanol. The system was operated
at a flow rate of 1.75 mL/min, using a Partisil 10 octadecyl
silane-2 reverse-phase column (4.6 mm  250 mm; Whatman).
A linear gradient gradually increased the methanol concentration: 35% to 55% from 0 to 7 minutes, and 55% to 80% from 7 to
14 minutes. The ABP-G was monitored at 280 nm and eluted at
5.1 minutes; the peak area was integrated by using ChemStation software from Agilent. A calibration curve of ABP-G
was established by using a pure standard (Y ¼ 0.421X þ
12.266, r2 ¼ 1.0, where Y is the peak area and X is pmol of
ABP-G injected to HPLC). The identity of urinary ABP-G was
confirmed by liquid chromatography/MS-MS (LC/MS-MS;
data not shown). Urinary creatinine was measured by using
a creatinine kit purchased from Caymen, according to the
manufacturer's instruction.

Figure 1. Nrf2 enhances ABP-induced DNA damage in bladder tissues
in vivo but inhibits such damage in bladder cells in vitro. A, Nrf2þ/þ mice and
Nrf2/ mice were treated with a single i.p. injection of ABP or vehicle; the
bladders were harvested 24 hours later for determination of dG-C8-ABP
levels by LC/MS-MS. B, RT4 cells were treated with control siRNA and
Nrf2 siRNA for 48 hours, followed by Western blotting of Nrf2 in whole cell
lysates. GAPDH was a loading control. C, after 48 hours of treatment with
control siRNA and Nrf2 siRNA, RT4 cells were exposed to ABP (plus S9)
or N-OH-AABP for 3 hours before dG-C8-ABP measurement.

Nrf2 provides protection against ABP and N-OH-AABP in
bladder cells. However, this finding is in stark contrast to
the in vivo effect of Nrf2 described above.
Nrf2 protects liver against ABP-induced DNA damage
and promotes UGT-mediated phase 2 metabolism and
urinary excretion of ABP
Although Nrf2 sensitizes bladder to ABP in vivo, hepatic dGC8-ABP levels were 2.6-fold higher in Nrf2-deficient mice than
in wild-type mice after treatment with ABP at 50 mg/kg for 24
hours (Fig. 2A). Hence, Nrf2 protects the liver against ABP.
In an attempt to further understand the dichotomy of Nrf2, we
examined enzymes that are known to be involved in ABP
metabolism. Aromatic amine acetyltransferases, NAT1 and
NAT2, participate in ABP metabolism. Liver NAT1 and NAT2
are thought to contribute to ABP detoxification by catalyzing
acetylation reactions of ABP or its N-hydroxylated metabolite, NOH-ABP. However, Western blot analysis of liver tissues of wildtype mice and Nrf2-deficient mice showed that Nrf2 had no
effect on either NAT1 or NAT2 (Fig. 2B). UGT is also known to
detoxify ABP by catalyzing the conjugation of ABP and N-OHABP with glucuronic acid in liver. The glucuronides, which are
excreted in urine, however, are known to dissociate in acidic
urine and thereby deliver the carcinogenic parent compounds to

bladder tissue (25–27). UGT represents a supergene family,
which is divided mainly into 2 subfamilies: UGT1A and UGT2B,
each of which is further divided into multiple isoforms (28).
Several Western blot bands (isoforms) of both UGT1A and
UGT2B were detected in the livers of Nrf2þ/þ mice and
Nrf2/ mice, but at least one isoform in each family showed
a profound decrease in the latter (Fig. 2B). Experiments to
identify the isoforms were not pursued for reasons provided
in the Discussion section. In accordance with the Western blot
results, liver enzymatic activity in catalyzing the conjugation of
ABP with glucuronic acid was 1.94-fold higher in the wild-type
mice than in the Nrf2-deficient mice (Fig. 2C). Likewise, the
24-hour urinary level of ABP-G (adjusted by urinary creatinine)
was 34% higher in the wild-type mice than in the Nrf2-deficient
mice, after treatment with ABP at 50 mg/kg (Fig. 2D). Urinary
levels of the glucuronic acid conjugate of N-OH-ABP could not
be measured due to high instability (26).
Taken together, our study has shown that Nrf2 protects the
liver against DNA damage caused by ABP but renders bladder

CPDT inhibits ABP-induced DNA damage and activates
the Nrf2 cytoprotective signaling system in cultured
bladder cells
We have recently shown that CPDT is a highly effective Nrf2
activator and phase 2 enzyme inducer in cultured bladder
cells, and that its induction of phase 2 enzymes depends on
Nrf2 (18). In a rat study in vivo, CPDT was particularly effective
in the bladder and, more significantly, Nrf2 activation and
induction of phase 2 enzymes in the bladder by CPDT
occurred exclusively in the epithelium, which is the principal
site of bladder cancer development (18). To find out whether
CPDT is capable of inhibiting ABP-induced DNA damage in
bladder cells, RT4 cells were first treated with CPDT at 12.5
and 25 mmol/L for 48 hours; cells were then incubated in fresh
medium containing 0.5 mmol/L ABP (plus 6% rat liver S9) or
0.1 mmol/L N-OH-AABP for 3 hours. dG-C8-ABP levels in these
cells were then measured. The CPDT concentrations and the
treatment conditions for ABP and N-OH-AABP were based on
previous findings (16, 18). CPDT treatment led to significant
and dose-dependent inhibition of dG-C8-ABP formation, up to
59% inhibition in the case of ABP and up to 84% inhibition in
the case of N-OH-AABP (Fig. 3A). Because CPDT was not
present in the culture medium during carcinogen exposure, a
direct antagonistic effect of CPDT on ABP or N-OH-ABP was
unlikely.
As expected, the protective effects of CPDT against ABP and
N-OH-AABP in RT4 cells were associated with significant
stimulation of the Nrf2 signaling system. RT4 cells after
treatment with CPDT at 12.5 and 25 mmol/L for 48 hours
showed marked increases in protein levels of Nrf2 and several
well-known Nrf2 target genes, including phase 2 gene NQO1
and both the catalytic and the regulatory subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCSc and GCSm; Fig. 3B). These genes
were assessed as biomarkers of Nrf2 transactivation activity
and may not necessarily mediate the inhibitory effect of CPDT.
Two UGT1A bands and 4 UGT2B bands were detected in RT4
cells, but CPDT had no effect on UGT1A and slightly elevated 2
UGT2B isoforms (Fig. 3B, indicated with the arrows). The
identities of these isoforms have not been determined.
In vivo, CPDT inhibits ABP-induced DNA damage in the
bladder but not in the liver
This study reveals that liver UGT assumes dual roles in
response to ABP—protecting the liver against ABP, but
increasing bladder exposure to ABP through increased synthesis and urinary excretion of glucuronides of ABP and its
metabolites. Because in RT4 cells CPDT strongly inhibited
DNA damage caused by ABP and N-OH-AABP and also
activated Nrf2 cytoprotective signaling, and a previous study
showed that CPDT activated Nrf2 signaling in the rat bladder
in vivo (18), we predicted that CPDT would inhibit ABPinduced DNA damage in the mouse bladder in vivo. However,
it was difficult to tell whether CPDT would protect liver

address these questions were carried out in both wild-type
mice and Nrf2-deficient mice, so that the potential involvement of Nrf2 could also be assessed. The mice were treated
with CPDT at 0, 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg by gavage once daily for 5
days; 3 hours after the last CPDT dose, each mouse was given
ABP at 50 mg/kg i.p.; the mice were killed 24 hours after the
ABP injection, and the bladders and livers were harvested for
measurement of tissue dG-C8-ABP levels. In a parallel experiment, mice were treated with only CPDT and were killed 24
hours after the last CPDT dose for measurement of induction
of UGT and other Nrf2 target genes.

ABP level was reduced by up to 68% (Fig. 4A). However, CPDT
was much less effective in the Nrf2-deficient mice, as bladder
dG-C8-ABP levels in mice treated with CPDT were reduced by
only 9% to 33% (Fig. 4A). Hence, Nrf2 plays an important role
in the ability of CPDT to protect bladder against ABP-induced
DNA damage in vivo. In contrast, CPDT treatment had virtually no effect on ABP-induced dG-C8-ABP formation in the
livers of the wild-type mice and was ineffective in the livers of
Nrf2-deficient mice, except at the lowest CPDT dose where
hepatic dG-C8-ABP levels in Nrf2-deficient mice were 30%
lower than in the control (P < 0.05; Fig. 4B). The reason for this
outlier, which is reproducible, is unknown.
The potential impact of CPDT on UGT and other Nrf2 target
genes in the bladder and liver tissues was examined by
Western blotting. Besides UGT1A and UGT2B, other genes,
including GCSc, GCSm, and NQO1, were assessed as indicators
of Nrf2 activation by CPDT. In agreement with our previous
data in rat (18), CPDT was more effective in the bladder than
in the liver in activating Nrf2 signaling, as GCSc, GCSm, and
NQO1 were all significantly elevated by CPDT in the bladders
of Nrf2þ/þ mice (Fig. 4C), but only NQO1 was elevated in the
livers of these animals (Fig. 4D). CPDT was unable to significantly induce these enzymes in the bladders and livers of
Nrf2/ mice. Interestingly, although both GCSc and GCSm
were largely undetectable in the bladders of Nrf2/ mice,
significant levels of these enzymes were detected in their liver
tissues, implying that these genes are subjected to regulation
by Nrf2-independent mechanisms in the liver. Multiple bands
of both UGT1A and UGT2B were detected in the bladder and
liver tissues (Fig. 4C and D), reflecting their multi-isomeric
nature. Three UGT1A bands were detected in both bladder
and liver, 2 of which were apparently not regulated by Nrf2,
whereas the third band (indicated by an arrow) was slightly
upregulated by Nrf2 and CPDT. Many more UGT2B isoforms
seem to exist in the liver than in the bladder, some of which
were expressed in an Nrf2-independent manner, but one
isoform in both bladder and liver was clearly upregulated
by Nrf2 and stimulated by CPDT (indicated by an arrow).
However, because CPDT showed no protective effect on ABPinduced DNA damage in the liver as described above, it is
unlikely that the limited induction of UGT by CPDT in the liver
is functionally important with regard to ABP detoxification
(glucuronidation). It is also possible that ABP is not the
substrate of the isoforms that were slightly induced by CPDT.
Indeed, liver activities of ABP glucuronidation were similar
between the control Nrf2þ/þ mice and Nrf2þ/þ mice treated
with the highest dose of CPDT (0.20  0.05 nmol/min/mg vs.
0.18  0.03 nmol/min/mg).

Discussion
ABP is a major human bladder carcinogen from tobacco
smoke and other environmental sources and is known to be
metabolically activated in liver. dG-C8-ABP is the predominant DNA adduct formed in human bladder cells and tissues
exposed to ABP and is closely associated with human bladder
cancer development and prognosis. Although numerous studies have shown that Nrf2 plays a critical role in cellular

defense against chemical carcinogens and oxidants, this study
has revealed a serious dilemma that Nrf2 faces in defense
against ABP. On one hand, Nrf2 protects liver against ABPinduced DNA damage, as Nrf2 knockout increased liver dGC8-ABP level by 2.7-fold in mice exposed to ABP (Fig. 2A). On
the other hand, Nrf2 renders bladder significantly more susceptible to the genotoxicity of ABP, as Nrf2 knockout
decreased bladder dG-C8-ABP level by 2.7-fold in mice
exposed to the same dose of ABP (Fig. 1A). However, in vitro,
Nrf2 protects bladder cells against ABP and its metabolite
(N-OH-AABP), as dG-C8-ABP levels in Nrf2-silenced cells
increased 1.8- to 1.9-fold (Fig. 1C). This suggested that Nrf2
acted at a site remote from the bladder in potentiating ABPinduced DNA damage in this organ in vivo. Indeed, further

studies in wild-type mice and Nrf2-deficient mice showed that
(i) levels of certain UGT1A and UGT2B isoforms were significantly higher in Nrf2þ/þ liver than in Nrf2/ liver (Fig. 2B);
(ii) Nrf2 knockout eliminated 49% of liver UGT activity in
catalyzing ABP glucuronidation (Fig. 2C); and (iii) Nrf2 knockout also led to a 34% decrease in the urinary level of ABP-G in
mice dosed with ABP (Fig. 2D). Given that it has been well
documented that the glucuronide conjugates of ABP and its
N-hydroxylated metabolites, which are produced in the liver
and disposed via urinary excretion, are unstable in acidic urine
and deliver the parent carcinogenic compounds to the bladder, our results strongly suggest that liver UGT is responsible,
at least in part, for the dichotomous effects of Nrf2 on ABP in
bladder and liver. NAT1 and NAT2 are also involved in ABP

metabolism, but Nrf2 had no effect on these enzymes in the
liver (Fig. 2B).
UGT is a supergene family, consisting of UGT1A and UGT2B
subfamilies, each of which is further divided into multiple
isoforms (29). A recent study showed that multiple UGT isoforms might be upregulated by Nrf2 in mouse liver, including
UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT2B1, UGT2B35, and UGT2B36 (1, 13). It
is not known at the present time which of these UGT isoform(s)
may catalyze the glucuronidation of ABP and its metabolites.
In our experiments, only one band of UGT1A and UGT2B
was clearly upregulated by Nrf2 and CPDT, but this may be
because of antibody specificity and sensitivity. We did not
attempt to measure the catalytic activity of specific mouse UGT
isoforms toward ABP or to determine the identities of Nrf2regulated UGT isoforms, because many UGT isoforms that are
expressed in mice are pseudogenes in humans, or vice versa
(30, 31), and a different set of UGT isoforms seem to be
upregulated by Nrf2 in humans, including UGT1A1, UGT1A8,
and UGT1A10 (15, 32). In view of the potentially important role
of UGT in bladder cancer, however, it is important in future
studies to identify the human UGT isoform(s) that is both
regulated by Nrf2 and catalyzes ABP glucuronidation.
Nrf2 plays an important role in bladder cell defense
against ABP locally (Fig. 1C). However, given that certain
UGT isoforms that metabolize ABP are upregulated by Nrf2,
that increased liver UGT activity likely increases bladder
exposure to ABP, and that ABP is a major human bladder
carcinogen, it seems important to identify Nrf2-activating
cancer chemopreventive agents that do not significantly
induce liver UGT, which promotes glucuronidation of ABP
and its metabolites, if such agents are to be developed for
use in humans exposed to ABP, particularly in smokers. A
previous study showed that sulforaphane, a naturally occurring chemopreventive agent, activated Nrf2 and protected
against ABP-induced DNA damage in the bladder in mice,
but sulforaphane also activated Nrf2 in the liver (16);
however, it has not been determined to what extent sulforaphane induces liver UGT. In this study, in cultured bladder
cells, CPDT strongly activated Nrf2 and Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective genes and inhibited DNA damage caused by ABP
and N-OH-AABP (Fig. 3). In the wild-type mice in vivo, it also
strongly inhibited bladder DNA damage in mice exposed to
ABP and activated Nrf2 signaling in that tissue (Fig. 4). In the
liver, however, CPDT had little effect on ABP-induced DNA
damage and did not induce 2 of the 3 Nrf2 genes examined.
Its inducing effect on UGT in the liver was also limited and
did not modulate liver activity of ABP glucuronidation. Thus,

the chemopreventive activity of CPDT is relatively bladder
specific. Our data also show that the chemopreventive
activity of CPDT was significantly attenuated but not completely eliminated in Nrf2-deficient mice (Fig. 4), indicating
that its activity is mediated through both Nrf2-dependent
and Nrf2-independent pathways.
In summary, although Nrf2 protects bladder tissues
against ABP locally, it counters such protective effect by
stimulating UGT and promoting UGT-catalyzed glucuronidation of ABP and its metabolites in liver and increasing
urinary excretion of such conjugates, which causes increased
exposure of bladder tissue to ABP. It is possible that Nrf2
may act in a similar manner toward other arylamine bladder
carcinogens. Indeed, Maeura and colleagues previously
showed that feeding rats with butylated hydroxytoluene, a
Nrf2 activator, reduced the formation of liver tumors following treatment with N-2-fluorenylacetamide (FAA), but led to
an increase in bladder tumors—tumors not seen in rats
treated with FAA alone (33). However, such a dichotomous
effect of Nrf2 was not detected in bladder carcinogenesis
induced by the nitrosamine carcinogen N-nitrosobutyl(4hydrobutyl) amine in mice (1). CPDT is a promising bladder
cancer chemopreventive agent, as it strongly protects bladder tissues and cells against ABP, and activates Nrf2 in the
bladder, but does not stimulate ABP glucuronidation in the
liver. Neither Nrf2 nor CPDT have been assessed for their
effects on ABP-induced bladder and liver cancer formation.
These experiments remain difficult, as the only available
animal protocol shows low tumor incidence, high mortality,
and long (2-year) tumor induction time by ABP (34).
