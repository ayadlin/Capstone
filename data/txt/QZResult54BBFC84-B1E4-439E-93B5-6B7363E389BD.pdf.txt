Abstract

Introduction

( )-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major biologically
active constituent of green tea, inhibits activation of the
epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and downstream signaling pathways in several types of human cancer
cells, but the precise mechanism is not known. Because several
plasma membrane-associated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
including EGFR are localized in detergent-insoluble ordered
membrane domains, so-called ‘‘lipid rafts,’’ we examined
whether the inhibitory effect of EGCG on activation of the
EGFR is associated with changes in membrane lipid order in
HT29 colon cancer cells. First, we did cold Triton X-100
solubility assays. Phosphorylated (activated) EGFR was found
only in the Triton X-100–insoluble (lipid raft) fraction,
whereas total cellular EGFR was present in the Triton X100–soluble fraction. Pretreatment with EGCG inhibited the
binding of Alexa Fluor 488–labeled EGF to the cells and also
inhibited EGF-induced dimerization of the EGFR. To examine
possible effects of EGCG on membrane lipid organization,
we labeled the cells with the fluorescent lipid analogue 1,
1¶-dihexadecyl-3,3,3¶,3¶-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate, which preferentially incorporates into ordered membrane domains in cells and found that subsequent treatment
with EGCG caused a marked reduction in the Triton X-100–
resistant membrane fraction. Polyphenon E, a mixture of
green tea catechins, had a similar effect but ( )-epicatechin
(EC), the biologically inactive compound, did not significantly
alter the Triton X-100 solubility properties of the membrane.
Furthermore, we found that EGCG but not EC caused dramatic
changes in the function of bilayer-incorporated gramicidin
channels. Taken together, these findings suggest that EGCG
inhibits the binding of EGF to the EGFR and the subsequent
dimerization and activation of the EGFR by altering membrane organization. These effects may also explain the ability
of EGCG to inhibit activation of other membrane-associated
RTKs, and they may play a critical role in the anticancer
effects of this and related compounds. [Cancer Res 2007;
67(13):6493–501]

Members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR)
family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) have been implicated in
the abnormal growth of several types of human cancers, including
cancers of the lung (1), head and neck (2), colon (3), prostate (4),
and breast (5). Other RTKs, including platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR; ref. 6) and insulin-like growth factor-I
receptor (IGF-IR; refs. 7, 8), are also implicated in various types of
human cancer. There is evidence that the EGFR (9–13), the HER2
(14), and the IGF-IR (15) are associated with specific organized
domains in the plasma membrane, sometimes called ‘‘lipid rafts,’’
although the precise organization of these RTKs in the plasma
membrane is not known. These ordered domains contain relatively
high levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids (16, 17), but the actual
size, precise composition, and dynamics of these domains are not
known (18). One method for analysis of incorporation in ordered
membrane domains involves extraction of cells with cold Triton
X-100 followed by isolation of a low buoyant density fraction by
density gradient centrifugation (9). The detergent-resistant fraction
is enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. These and other
studies suggest that the plasma membrane contains coexisting
cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich domains with a higher degree of
lipid order, as well as more disordered domains enriched in
phospholipids with unsaturated hydrocarbon chains (19). Lipids
with long and saturated acyl chains, such as the synthetic
fluorescent lipid analogue 1,1¶-dihexadecyl-3,3,3¶,3¶-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiIC16), preferentially partition into
the ordered domains (20). In many studies, these and other lipid
analogues have been used to observe the formation and dynamics
of membrane domains in living cells (21, 22).
There is evidence that the amount of cholesterol, the status of
lipid unsaturation, and the charge on lipid head groups are
important determinants of the structure of membrane domains
(23). Furthermore, cholesterol may play a crucial role in modulating signaling from plasma membrane-associated receptors.
Thus, the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl h-cyclodextrin
(MhCD) can cause ligand-independent activation of the EGFR,
apparently by altering membrane lipid organization (11–13, 24). By
contrast, depletion of cholesterol from vascular smooth muscle
cells by treatment with MhCD led to inhibition of angiotensin II–
stimulated phosphorylation of the EGFR (25), and treatment of
prostate cancer cells with MhCD to reduce cellular cholesterol
levels inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and the downstream
protein AKT (10). Thus, depending on the cell system and pathway,
cholesterol depletion seems to have both positive and negative
effects on RTK-mediated signaling.

Cancer Research

Green tea contains several polyphenolic compounds, including
the catechins ( )-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), ( )-epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), and ( )-epicatechin
(EC). Among the green tea constituents, EGCG is the major
biologically active polyphenol in green tea; it has been shown to
inhibit the growth of several types of cancer cell lines (2, 3, 5, 26).
This is associated with inhibition of phosphorylation (i.e.,
activation) of the EGFR and inhibition of several downstream
signaling pathways (2, 3, 27). EGCG can also inhibit activation of
other RTKs, including HER2, HER3, HER4, IGFI-R, PDGFR, and
fibroblast growth factor (2, 3, 6, 8, 28). Although there is evidence
that EGCG may directly interfere with EGF binding to the EGFR
(28), the ubiquitous effect of EGCG on several RTKs suggests that it
might act on these plasma membrane-associated proteins by a
more general mechanism. Indeed, it was reported recently that in
the human basophilic cell line KU812, EGCG binds to the cell
surface and preferentially associates with lipid rafts in these cells
(29). Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed whether
inhibition of activation of the EGFR in HT29 human colon cancer
cells is associated with changes in plasma membrane lipid order in
these cells. In the absence of EGCG, the activated form of EGFR
[phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR)] was present in the Triton X-100–
insoluble fraction of HT29 cells. Treatment with EGCG inhibited
EGF binding as well as EGFR dimerization and activation. These
effects were associated with depletion of the Triton X-100–resistant
fraction of the plasma membrane. Similar inhibitory effects on
activation of the EGFR and changes in plasma membrane lipid
order were seen with the catechin mixture Polyphenon E (PolyE),
but not with the biologically inactive compound EC. To explore
whether EGCG could act through a general, bilayer-mediated
mechanism, we also tested its effect on bilayer-incorporated
gramicidin channels, where EGCG alters channel function at
submicromolar concentrations, whereas EC is inactive. These
findings suggest a novel mechanism by which EGCG, and perhaps
other specific polyphenolic compounds, can inhibit the activity of
specific RTKs and thereby exert anticancer effects.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. EGCG, EC, ECG, EGC, PolyE, and theaflavin-3 were kindly
provided by Dr. Yukihiko Hara (Mitsui Norin Co., Shizuoka, Japan).
Curcumin and resveratrol were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
Cyanidin and delphinidin were provided by Dr. Edward J. Kennelly (The City
University of New York, Bronx, NY). All compounds were diluted in DMSO.
DiIC16 was purchased from Invitrogen.
Cell culture conditions. The human colon cancer cell line HT29 was
maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen), containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For
the microscopy experiments, 5  104 cells were plated 72 h before the
experiments in 35-mm plastic tissue culture dishes with a 7-mm hole in the
bottom covered by poly-D-lysine–coated coverslips (30). For Western blot
analysis, the cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h before they
were pretreated with the indicated compound for the indicated time. As
indicated in the figure legends, 15 min before harvesting, 100 ng/mL EGF
(Sigma) was added to activate the EGFR.
Triton X-100 solubility assay. Extraction of Triton X-100–soluble and
Triton X-100–insoluble membrane constituents was done as described
previously (10, 31). In brief, cells were resuspended in buffer A [25 mmol/L
2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid, 150 mmol/L NaCl (pH 6.5)]. To this,
an equal volume of the same buffer with 2% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L
Na3VO4, and 2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added,
and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with no agitation. Insoluble
fractions were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4jC. The
supernatant fraction was removed [‘‘S’’ (soluble) fraction], and the insoluble

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

pellet was resuspended in buffer B [1% Triton X-100, 10 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.6), 500 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L Na3VO4, 60 mmol/L h-octylglucoside
(Sigma), 1 mmol/L PMSF] for 30 min on ice. Debris was pelleted in a
microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4jC, and the supernatant fraction was
collected. This fraction is referred to as ‘‘I’’ (insoluble) and represents the
lipid raft fraction. The primary antibodies used in this study were antip-EGFR (Tyr1068; Cell Signaling), anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and
anti-actin antibody (Sigma), respectively.
Cross-linking of EGFR. Cross-linking experiments were done as
described (32) with minor modifications. Cells were washed with ice-cold
PBS before incubation on ice for 30 min with the nonpermeable crosslinking reagent bis (sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3; 3 mmol/L in PBS;
Pierce). In all experiments, a freshly prepared solution of BS3 was used. The
reaction was quenched for 5 min by the addition of 1 mol/L glycine (pH 8.0;
final concentration of 250 mmol/L). The cells were then washed with cold
PBS and lysed in buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton
X-100, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 Ag/mL
aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 2 mmol/L PMSF] and suspended with by
aspiration through 23-gauge needle. The lysates were clarified at 14,000 rpm
in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min at 4jC. The supernatant fraction was
collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 5% polyacrylamide gel followed by
immunoblotting with anti-EGFR antibody.
EGF binding assay. Twenty-four hours before the experiment, the
medium was changed to serum-free DMEM. After pretreatment with the
indicated compound in serum-free DMEM, the cells were treated with
100 ng/mL Alexa Fluor 488 EGF complex (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 1 h at
4jC (on ice) to prevent EGF-induced internalization of the EGFR and then
fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then examined using
fluorescent confocal microscopy. To quantify, the cells were exposed to
Alexa-EGF (100 ng/mL) for 1 h at 4jC after the indicated treatment at 37jC.
They were then washed with cold PBS and harvested by the addition
of trypsin and gentle scraping at 4jC followed by fixation with 2%
paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were then analyzed for cell surface–
bound Alexa-EGF by flow cytometry using a FACS Calibur instrument with
CellQuest computer program (Becton Dickinson).
Cold Triton X-100 extractability of DiIC16. Cold Triton X-100
extractability of DiIC16 was done as described previously (18). To prepare
the labeling solution, 750 nmol DiIC16 was dissolved in 1 mL methanol.
The cells were grown previously on coverslip-bottomed dishes and then
taken out of the CO2 incubator, rinsed several times with isotonic medium
1 [150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, and
20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4); supplemented with 2 g/L glucose], and then
labeled with a 1:1,000 dilution of the DiI labeling solution for 3 min at 37jC.
The cells were then washed with ice-cold cytoskeleton stabilization buffer
[CSB; 138 mmol/L KCl, 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 0.32 mol/L
sucrose, 10 mmol/L MES (pH 6.1); ref. 33], extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100
on ice for 30 min, and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde.
Confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy was done using an Axiovert
100M inverted microscope equipped with an LSM 510 laser scanning unit
and a 63 1.4 NA plan Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Cells labeled
with DiIC16 were excited with a helium/neon laser emitting at 543 nm, and
a 560-nm long-pass filter was used for collecting emissions. Alexa Fluor
488–conjugated EGF was excited with an argon ion laser emitting at
488 nm, and a 505-nm long pass filter was used for emissions.
Image analysis. All image analyses were done using MetaMorph
(Molecular Devices). Fixed threshold intensity was applied to F-actin
fluorescence images, and the number of pixels above the threshold was
defined as cell area. A threshold was then applied to the DiIC16 fluorescence
image such that only DiIC16-positive pixels were used in calculating the
percentage of the DiIC16-positive staining per cell area, using the following
formula: DiIC16-positive area = (the number of DiIC16-positive pixels) / (cell
area). At least, 30 cells were measured at each sample.
Studies with synthetic lipid bilayers. The bilayer-forming lipid was 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids), which was used
without further purification and dissolved (2% w/v) in n-decane (99.9% pure
from ChemSampCo). The gramicidin analogues [Ala1] gA (AgA) and [D-Ala1]
gA (AgA ) were synthesized and purified as described previously (34).

EGCG Alters Membrane Organization
Planar lipid bilayers were formed across a 1.6-mm diameter hole in a Teflon
partition separating two electrolyte solutions (1 mol/L CsCl, buffered to pH
7.0 using 10 mmol/L HEPES from Sigma). Gramicidin single-channel
experiments were done using the bilayer punch method (35) at 25 F 1jC.
All measurements where done using a Dagan 3900A Integrating patch
clamp, with a 200 mV applied potential. The current signal was filtered with
a low-pass Bessel filter at 1,000 Hz and digitized at 20 kHz.

Results
p-EGFR is localized in the Triton X-100–insoluble fraction,
and total EGFR is localized in the Triton X-100–soluble
fraction of HT29 cells. In previous studies, we found that EGCG
and PolyE suppressed phosphorylation of the EGFR in HT29 cells,
but the precise mechanism was not apparent (3). There is evidence
that activation of EGFR occurs within ordered domains (lipid rafts)
in the plasma membrane (10). Therefore, we examined by Western
blot analysis with the appropriate antibodies the effects of EGCG
and PolyE on the distribution of total EGFR and p-EGFR, the
activated form of EGFR, in the cold Triton X-100–insoluble (lipid
raft) fraction, designated ‘‘I,’’ and in the cold Triton X-100–soluble
(non–lipid raft) fraction, designated ‘‘S,’’ of lipid extracts of HT29
cells (see Materials and Methods). To validate the extraction
method, we first studied the extraction of caveolin-1 in untreated
HT29 cells. Western blot analysis indicated that caveolin-1
partitioned, almost completely, into the I fraction (Fig. 1A, lanes 1
and 2), which is consistent with previous studies (10, 13).
Pretreatment of HT29 cells with 20 Ag/mL EGCG for 1 h caused a
partial shift of caveolin from the I to the S fraction (Fig. 1A, lanes 3
and 4). These results suggest that EGCG might directly influence
plasma membrane organization.
We next examined by cold Triton X-100 extraction and Western
blot analysis, whether the EGFR and p-EGFR were present in the I
or S lipid fractions of HT29 cells (Fig. 1B). When serum-starved
HT29 cells were not treated with EGF, most of the total cellular
EGFR was found in the S fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 1). We also detected
a small amount of p-EGFR, and this was present only in the I
fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Presumably, this reflects partial activation
of the EGFR by the autocrine production of transforming growth
factor a (TGFa) in these cells (3). Treatment of the cells with
100 ng/mL EGF for 15 min resulted in an increase in the amount of
p-EGFR, which was again confined to the I fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 4).
Pretreatment of the cells with 20 Ag/mL EGCG or PolyE for 1 h
(Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 10, respectively) caused a marked decrease in
the amount of p-EGFR in the I fraction, whereas treatment with EC,
a biologically inactive catechin present in green tea (3), had no
effect (Fig. 1B, lane 8). These results provide evidence that the bulk
of the EGFR protein is present in the disordered lipid domains of
these cells. With activation by EGF, a portion of these molecules is
associated with detergent-resistant membranes, and both EGCG
and PolyE inhibit this activation process. We also found that when
the cells were treated with EGCG in the absence of added EGF, the
small amount of p-EGFR found in Fig. 1B (lane 2) could not be
detected in the Triton X-100–soluble fraction (data not shown),
presumably because EGCG also inhibits activation of the EGFR by
endogenous TGFa.
EGCG and PolyE, but not EC, inhibit EGFR dimer formation.
Structural studies of the EGFR led to the proposal of a novel
mechanism for ligand-induced receptor dimerization (36). In this
model, the binding of EGF to the extracellular domain of the EGFR
induces a dramatic conformational change in the EGFR protein,
exposing a dimerization site in the cytoplasmic domain that is

the DMSO solvent and 20 Ag/mL EGCG, EC, or PolyE for 1 h at 37jC. Before
harvesting, the cells were stimulated at 37jC with EGF (100 ng/mL) for 15 min.
The cells were then harvested and extracted with cold Triton X-100 into a soluble
(S ) and an insoluble (I ) fraction, as described in Materials and Methods. The

normally occluded in the inactivated conformation, thus promoting dimer formation. The above studies and our previous studies in
HT29 cells (3) indicated that EGCG and PolyE inhibit activation of
the EGFR. We therefore investigated whether EGCG also affect
EGFR dimerization. Serum-starved HT29 cells were stimulated
with EGF (100 ng/mL) for 15 min after pretreatment with the
solvent (0.1% DMSO), EGCG, EC, or PolyE, and then the intact cells
were exposed to the membrane-impermeable cross-linker BS3 (32).
Cell extracts were then prepared and examined by Western blot
analysis with an anti-EGFR antibody (Fig. 1C). As expected,
treatment with EGF enhanced EGFR dimer formation (Fig. 1C,
compare lanes 1 and 2). In addition, the EGFR dimer was found in
the Triton X-100–insoluble fraction (data not shown), which is
consistent with the results obtained in Fig. 1B. On the other hand,
EGCG and PolyE (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 5), but not EC (Fig. 1C, lane 4),
inhibited dimerization of the EGFR. These results provide further
evidence that EGCG and PolyE suppress ligand-dependent activation of EGFR.
EGCG and PolyE, but not EC, inhibit EGF binding. It was
previously reported that EGCG inhibited the binding of 125I-EGF
to intact A431 cells (28). To further investigate how EGCG inhibits
activation of EGFR, we examined effects of EGCG, EC, and PolyE on
EGF binding to intact HT29 cells using Alexa Fluor 488–labeled
EGF and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). First, we confirmed that
Alexa-EGF stimulated phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 2A). When
HT29 cells were exposed to Alexa-EGF for 1 h at 4jC, the cell
membranes displayed strong fluorescence (Fig. 2B, 2). This binding
of Alexa-EGF to the cells was completely blocked by an excess of
unlabeled EGF (data not shown). Pretreatment of the cells with
20 Ag/mL EGCG at 37jC for 10 min before the addition of AlexaEGF (Fig. 2B, 3) markedly inhibited, whereas pretreatment with
20 Ag/mL EGCG or PolyE for 30 min almost completely inhibited,
the binding of Alexa-EGF to these cells (Fig. 2B, 4, 7, and 9). When
EGCG and Alexa-EGF were added simultaneously to the cells at
4jC, EGCG did not reduce the binding of Alexa-EGF to the cells
(data not shown), which suggests that the inhibition of Alexa-EGF
binding to the cells is not simply due to physical competition for
binding sites. It is of interest that previous studies showing that
EGCG inhibits 125I-EGF binding to A431 cells were also done at
37jC (28). Pretreatment of the cells with 20 Ag/mL EC had no
detectable effect on Alexa-EGF binding to the cells (Fig. 2B, 8).
These data provide evidence that the ability of EGCG and PolyE to
inhibit phosphorylation (Fig. 1B) and dimerization of the EGFR
(Fig. 1C) are a consequence of the ability of EGCG to inhibit
binding of EGF to the EGFR. We also found that when the cells
were treated with EGCG for 30 min at 37jC and then washed and
incubated at 37jC with fresh medium lacking EGCG, Alexa-EGF
binding was restored to control levels within 4 h. Therefore, this
effect of EGCG is reversible (data not shown).
Treatment of HT29 cells with EGCG causes a reduction in
Triton X-100 resistance of the plasma membrane. As mentioned
in Introduction, there is evidence that lipid organization can affect
the activation and functions of EGFR (10–13, 24, 25) and other
membrane-associated receptors (14, 15). Indeed, we found that the
activated form of the EGFR is specifically associated with the
Triton X-100–insoluble fraction of HT29 cells (see Fig. 1), which is
enriched in ordered lipids. Therefore, we carried out a series of
studies to determine possible effects of EGCG on lipid order in cell
membranes. We used an assay in which the cells are first
fluorescently stained with the compound DiIC16, a lipid-mimetic
dialkylindocarbocyanine that preferentially incorporates into

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

detergent-resistant plasma membrane lipid domains (20). The
cells were then exposed to cold Triton X-100, which preferentially
extracts the disordered domains. Thus, after this extraction, DiIC16
labels the detergent-resistant cell membranes, and the extent of
these detergent-resistant membranes can be quantified by
fluorescent confocal microscopy (18).
Figure 3A (1) shows HT29 cells that were labeled with DiIC16 for
3 min and then exposed to the DMSO-containing solvent (control)
for 30 min at 37jC before extraction with cold Triton X-100. As has
been reported for other cells (18), a large fraction of the plasma
membrane lipids remain unextracted by cold Triton X-100, and the
remaining plasma membrane forms a large sheet with many small

stimulates p-EGFR. B and C, the cells were treated at 37jC with the indicated
compound (20 Ag/mL) for the indicated time. After this pretreatment, the cells
were exposed to Alexa-EGF (100 ng/mL) for 1 h at 4jC and then washed with
cold CSB (see Materials and Methods). The cells were then fixed with 2%

surface–bound Alexa-EGF. Aliquots of the same cells shown in panels 5 to 9 in (B)

found that only 5-min exposure of the cells to EGCG was sufficient
to cause a detectable decrease in the ordered domains (data not
shown). This effect of EGCG is not confined to this cell type
because we have seen similar effects with the SW480 colon cancer
cell line (data not shown). In the studies shown in Fig. 3, the cells
were treated with EGCG in serum-free medium. However, loss of
detergent-resistant membrane was also seen when the cells were
treated with EGCG in the presence of 10% serum, although the
effect was diminished by f30% (data not shown). We also found
that when the cells were treated with EGCG for 30 min at 37jC and
then washed and incubated at 37jC with fresh medium lacking
EGCG, DiIC16 staining of plasma membranes was restored to
control levels within 4 h. Therefore, this effect of EGCG on
disruption of lipid order is also reversible (data not shown).
In view of these results, it was of interest to also examine in the
above assay system other catechins and the plant-derived
polyphenolic compounds curcumin, resveratrol, cyanidin, and
delphinidin because they have also been reported to have
anticancer activity in various experimental systems (37). The
results are summarized in Table 1. The green tea–derived catechin
ECG was active with a potency similar to that of EGCG, whereas
the catechin EGC, like EC, was inactive. Theaflavin-3, which
is present in black tea, had an activity similar to that of EGCG
(Table 1). Curcumin displayed weak activity at 50 Amol/L, but
resveratrol, cyanidin, and delphinidin were inactive even when

holes (Fig. 3A, 1 and C, 5). Similar results were obtained when the
DiIC16-stained cells were treated with 20 Ag/mL EC for 30 min at
37jC (Fig. 3A, 3). Treatment with 20 Ag/mL EGCG or PolyE led to
extensive loss of DiIC16-labeled membrane after cold Triton X-100

area is quantified in Fig. 3B. As shown in Fig. 3C, when the cells
were treated with 5, 10, or 20 Ag/mL EGCG, there was a dosedependent decrease in the amount of unextracted DiIC16-labeled
membrane. These results are quantified in Fig. 3D. As little as
5 Ag/mL EGCG and a 30-min exposure was sufficient to reduce the
content of detergent-resistant membrane in HT29 cells. Indeed, we

tested at 50 Amol/L. The relative activities of the green tea
catechins EGCG, ECG, EGC, and EC in this assay reflected their
relative potencies for growth inhibition of HT29 cells because in
the latter assays, their IC50 values in HT29 cells were 50, 80, 180,
and >200 Amol/L, respectively (data not shown). In addition,
theaflavin-3 is relatively potent in inhibiting the growth of some
cancer cells (38, 39).
EGCG also exerts effects on gramicidin channels imbedded
in synthetic lipid bilayers. To explore whether the EGCG-induced
alteration of membrane domain organization could be due to
EGCG-bilayer interactions, we examined whether EGCG altered the
function of bilayer-spanning gramicidin channels. Gramicidin
channels are single-molecule probes of lipid bilayer properties
(40) and thus can be used to monitor how small molecules alter
bilayer-protein interactions. Gramicidin channels are formed by
the transmembrane dimerization of two nonconducting subunits
residing in each bilayer leaflet. Because the hydrophobic length of
the channels is less than the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer,
channel formation is associated with a local bilayer thinning
meaning that the bilayer exerts a disjoining force on the channels.
Therefore, drug-induced changes in bilayer properties would be
expected to alter the function of gramicidin channels. In the
simplest case, this would occur by altering the energetic of the
bilayer deformation associated with changes in the gramicidin
monomer X dimer equilibrium. This feature makes gramicidin an
excellent probe for measuring changes in lipid bilayer mechanical
properties (40).
Figure 4A shows that EGCG is a potent modifier of AgA channel
function in synthetic lipid bilayers. In the absence of EGCG, the
AgA channels appear as stepwise transitions between three welldefined current levels corresponding to the presence of 0, 1, and 2
channels in the membrane. In the presence of only 250 nmol/L
EGCG, the channel appearances changed qualitatively, with
numerous downward transitions ( flickers) from the conducting
state, indicating that EGCG causes brief interruptions in the flow of
ions through the channels. In some cases, the flickers were to the
nonconducting current level; in other cases, the flickers were to
some intermediate current level. Similar results were observed with
the enantiomeric AgA channels (data not shown), indicating that
the flickery channel activity is unlikely to result from direct
interaction between EGCG and the AgA channels because this
would be expected to vary with the channel chirality (right-handed
versus left-handed helix sense). In contrast to the results with
EGCG, EC had no detectable effect on AgA channel function up to
10 Amol/L (Fig. 4B). EC did not cause the appearance of flickers in
the conducting state; furthermore, it did not alter the channel
appearance rate and lifetime.

Discussion
The present study provides the first evidence that EGCG, a
catechin present in green tea that has anticancer activity in several
experimental systems, directly alters the organization of the plasma
membrane in cancer cells. We found that treatment of HT29 colon
cancer cells with EGCG at concentrations as low as 5 Ag/mL (10.9
Amol/L) caused within 30 min a reduction in ordered lipid domains
in the plasma membrane of these cells (Fig. 3). Similar effects on
disruption of detergent-resistant membranes were seen with ECG,
PolyE (a mixture of green tea catechins), and theaflavin-3, whereas
EC had no detectable effect on detergent resistance of plasma
membrane lipids (Table 1). This correlates well with evidence that

the first three compounds inhibit the in vitro growth of cancer cells
(3, 39, 41). Previous studies indicate that auto-oxidation may play a
role in some of the cell culture effects of EGCG (42). However, we
found that when our assays were done in the presence of
superoxide dismutase (SOD), the ability of EGCG to induce a loss
of detergent-resistant lipids in HT29 cells was actually enhanced
(data not shown), thus providing evidence that the change in
membrane organization induced by EGCG is exerted by the parent
compound itself. Because EGCG caused marked inhibition of
cellular levels of p-EGFR even in the presence of 15 units/mL SOD
(data not shown), it is unlikely that in our cell system, the
inhibitory effect of EGCG on activation of the EGFR is due to autooxidation of EGCG.

EGCG Alters Membrane Organization

Detergent-resistant membranes are enriched in cholesterol and
sphingomyelin (16, 17, 43), and previous studies indicated that
EGCG can deplete cholesterol from synthetic lipid micelles (44).
However, using filipin staining to quantify membrane cholesterol
content, we did not observe an appreciable loss of cholesterol in
EGCG-treated HT29 cells. In addition, cholesterol repletion studies
indicated that although this restored detergent resistance to the
lipids in cells previously treated with the cholesterol-depleting
agent, MhCD, cholesterol repletion did not restore detergent
resistance in EGCG treated cells.5 Furthermore, EGCG altered the
function of gramicidin channels in a synthetic lipid bilayer system
that lacks cholesterol (Fig. 4). Therefore, cholesterol does not seem
to be the critical target for EGCG in the plasma membrane of cells.
Further studies are required to determine at the molecular level
how EGCG inserts into membrane structures and thereby disrupts
lipid organization.
In previous studies, we and other investigators found that EGCG
inhibits activation of the EGFR, and downstream signaling
pathways, in several types of cancer cells (2, 3, 5, 26), but the
precise mechanism has not been elucidated. Furthermore, there is
evidence that the EGFR is associated with detergent-resistant
domains in the plasma membrane of cells (10–13, 24, 25).
Therefore, our finding that EGCG decreases the amount of the
plasma membrane that is detergent-resistant domains may explain,
at least in part, the inhibitory effects of EGCG on EGFR function.
Indeed, we found that under the same conditions in which EGCG
alters lipid organization in HT29 cells, it also inhibited binding of
Alexa-labeled EGF to the surface of these cells and inhibited
dimerization and autophosphorylation of the EGFR (Figs. 1B and C
and 2). Furthermore, we found that when HT29 cells were treated
with EGF to activate the EGFR and the cells were then extracted
with cold Triton X-100, most of the total cellular EGFR protein was
present in the cold Triton X-100–soluble fraction, but the
phosphorylated and activated form of EGFR was present in the
Triton X-100–insoluble fraction. In addition, pretreatment with
EGCG or PolyE, but not EC, markedly decreased the level of
phosphorylation of EGFR in the Triton X-100–insoluble fraction
(Fig. 1B). Although the Triton X-100 fractionation procedure may
not be precise, these results provide evidence that most of the total
cellular EGFR resides mainly in disordered domains, whereas the
activated form of EGFR resides mainly in ordered domains in the
plasma membrane of these cells.
Figure 5 presents a hypothetical model that may explain these
results. We postulate that in HT29 cells grown in the absence of
EGF, most of the total cellular EGFR resides in the disordered
domains (non–lipid raft fraction) of the plasma membrane and that
during activation by EGF or TGFa EGFR is translocated to ordered
domains or that ordered domains are formed in association with
the process of EGFR activation. This would explain why we found
most of the total cellular EGFR in the Triton X-100–soluble fraction
and p-EGFR in the Triton X-100–insoluble fraction (Fig. 1B). Thus,
the ability of EGCG to disrupt ordered domains in these cells (Fig. 3;
Table 1) might explain the ability of EGCG to inhibit activation of
the EGFR. Consistent with this model, EGCG, ECG, PolyE, and
theaflavin-3 disrupt lipid ordered domains in HT29 cells and also
inhibit activation of the EGFR, whereas EC and EGC exert neither
of these functions (Fig. 1B and C; Table 1).5 We should, however,

emphasize that our findings do not exclude the possibility that the
inhibition of activation of the EGFR by EGCG occurs independent
of the effects of EGCG on ordered lipid domains, and further
studies are required to clarify this association. Nevertheless, the
model presented in Fig. 5 is consistent with recent studies on the
IgE receptor FcqRI in human basophilic cells (45). The latter study
provided evidence that before activation uncross-linked FcqRI
receptors reside largely outside lipid rafts and that the cross-linking
of these receptors induced by specific antigen enhances their
association with lipid rafts and the activation of these receptors by
the Lyn kinase. Furthermore, other investigators found that in this
cell system, EGCG is associated with lipid rafts and can suppress
expression of FcqRI-activated receptors (46). Further studies are
also required to determine how EGCG disrupts lipid organization in
the plasma membrane and whether this also perturbs the
subsequent internalization and recycling of the EGFR.
Our finding that relatively low concentrations of EGCG (0.25–3
Amol/L), but not EC, alter gramicidin channel function in synthetic
lipid bilayers (Fig. 4) provides evidence that EGCG can directly
modify the structure of lipid bilayers. It is unlikely that this is due
to direct interaction between EGCG and the gramicidin channel
because EGCG had similar effects on channels formed by the
enantiomeric pair of gramicidin analogues AgA and AgA
channels. At higher concentrations (>3 Amol/L), EGCG also
increased the average channel lifetime (data not shown), indicating
that EGCG reduces the bilayer stiffness (the disjoining force the
bilayer imposes on the bilayer-spanning gramicidin channels).
Taken together with previous studies on the effects of genistein (47)
and curcumin (48) on gramicidin channel function in synthetic
lipid bilayers, these results suggest that the disruption of ordered

Figure 5. A hypothetical model of how EGCG inhibits activation of the EGFR in
HT29 cells. According to this model, most of the total cellular EGFR resides
mainly in disordered domains (non–lipid rafts) in the plasma membrane. Binding
of the ligand, EGF, or TGFa to EGFRs and the subsequent activation
(autophosphorylation) and dimerization of these molecules occurs mainly in lipid
rafts. Therefore, the disruption of lipid rafts by EGCG inhibits ligand binding to the
EGFR, autophosphorylation, and dimerization of EGFRs.

lipid domains in the plasma membrane of cells by EGCG may not
involve direct binding of EGCG to cholesterol, sphingomyelin, or
specific membrane-associated proteins.
On the other hand, EGCG can bind with high affinity to the
67-kDa laminin receptor protein, which, curiously, is associated
with lipid rafts, and there is evidence that this binding plays an
important role in mediating the FcqRI-suppressive action of EGCG
in basophilic KU812 cells (29, 49). In addition, there is evidence that
EGCG can directly inhibit activation of the EGFR (28) and that it
binds directly to vimentin (50). Thus, EGCG might exert biological
effects in cancer cells by targeting multiple components in cell
membranes, thereby disrupting several aspects of membrane
organization and function.
In summary, the present study provides evidence that the ability
of EGCG and related naturally occurring compounds to inhibit
activation of the EGFR and related downstream signaling pathways
in cancer cells is due, at least in part, to disruption of ordered
domains in the plasma membrane of these cells. These effects on
membrane domain organization may also explain the ability of
EGCG to inhibit activation of other membrane-associated RTKs,

such as IGF-IR and ErbB2, because these receptors also seem to be
associated with lipid rafts (14, 15). Our studies suggest a novel
mechanism by which EGCG, and perhaps several other naturally
occurring polyphenolic compounds, exert anticancer effects in
various experimental systems. Further studies are required to
determine whether these effects of EGCG are preferential for
cancer cells, perhaps because of alterations in the structure of their
plasma membrane, and whether they also occur in vivo.
