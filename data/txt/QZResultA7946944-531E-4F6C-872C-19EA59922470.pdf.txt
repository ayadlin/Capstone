Abstract
BALB-neuT mice expressing an activated rat c-erbB-2/neu
transgene under the mouse mammary tumor virus long
terminal repeat show enhanced hematopoiesis with hyperproduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC)
because of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted
by the tumor. Here, we show that both tumor and stromal cells
express matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), thereby increasing the levels of pro–MMP-9 in the sera of tumor-bearing
mice. Treatment with amino-biphosphonates impaired tumor
growth, significantly decreased MMP-9 expression and the
number of macrophages in tumor stroma, and reduced MDSC
expansion both in bone marrow and peripheral blood by
dropping serum pro–MMP-9 and VEGF. We dissected the role
of tumor-derived MMP-9 from that secreted by stromal
leukocytes by transplanting bone marrow from MMP-9
knockout mice into BALB-neuT mice. Although bone marrow
progenitor–derived MMP-9 had a major role in driving MDSC
expansion, amino-biphosphonate treatment of bone marrow
chimeras further reduced both myelopoiesis and the supportive tumor stroma, thus enhancing tumor necrosis. Moreover,
by reducing MDSC, amino-biphosphonates overcome the
tumor-induced immune suppression and improved the generation and maintenance of antitumor immune response
induced by immunization against the p185/HER-2. Our data
reveal that suppression of MMP-9 activity breaks the vicious
loop linking tumor growth and myeloid cell expansion, thus
reducing immunosuppression. Amino-biphosphonates disclose a specific MMP-9 inhibitory activity that may broaden
their application above their current usage. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Alteration in bone marrow hematopoiesis and immune response
almost invariably accompanies tumor growth. Myeloid cell
expansion often occurs in response to tumor-secreted cytokines
and growth factors that foster bone marrow activity (1, 2). Such

expanded myeloid cells contribute to tumor progression, providing
both supporting stroma and immune evasion (3–8). In the tumor
stroma, they provide growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins,
and matrix-degrading enzymes that create new space for growing
tumors by remodeling nearby tissue and by contributing to
metastatic processes and angiogenesis. Moreover, they promote
immune escape by inhibiting lymphocyte activation (7, 9–11) and
antigen recognition (12).
Transgenic female mice expressing the transforming rat
oncogene c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu) under the mouse mammary tumor
virus promoter (BALB-neuT) spontaneously develop mammary
carcinomas with a progression resembling that of human breast
cancer. In BALB-neuT mice, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) released by the tumor is the main factor that conditions
hematopoiesis toward the massive expansion of a Gr1/CD11b
double-positive, immature myeloid cell population (2). These cells
inhibit T-lymphocyte proliferation in response to allogeneic and
T-cell antigen receptor–mediated stimulation and, because of their
immunosuppressive activity, they have been named myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSC; ref. 13). In tumor-bearing animals,
MDSC expansion is a reversible phenomenon, as tumor removal or
transplantation of hyperplastic bone marrow into tumor-free mice
results in normal hematopoiesis and rescue of the immune
response (2).
MDSCs require matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) for their
function (5). Moreover, MMP-9 is a stromal factor that regulates the
mobilization of hemopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow
niche by solubilizing the membrane-bound form of c-KitL (14, 15).
Because it remodels the extracellular matrix and promotes
sprouting and growth of new blood vessels by making VEGF
available to the VEGFR-2/flk receptor on endothelial cells, MMP-9
is also a linchpin in tumor progression (15–18).
A logical therapeutic approach to cancer would therefore include
inhibiting MMP-9. However, MMP inhibitors have failed or shown
toxicity in several clinical trials (19, 20). Amino-biphosphonates
offers an interesting alternative. Their current application in cancer
therapy for treatment of bone metastases and associated pain owes
to their well-known toxic effect on osteoclasts and inhibition of
tumor adhesion to mineralized matrices (21, 22). In addition to
these activities, amino-biphosphonates inhibit MMP-9 expressed
by the cells in the tumor stroma and thereby, impair VEGF
availability, thus reducing tumor angiogenesis (23). These observations suggest that amino-biphosphonates potentially could be used
to inhibit some MMP-9 effects perhaps without the toxicity of less
selective inhibitors. In this study, we investigated whether aminobiphosphonates can antagonize tumor-induced MDSC expansion

Zoledronate Breaks MMP-9/VEGF Loop in Breast Tumor

by inhibiting the MMP-9–VEGF loop that forces hyperactive
hematopoiesis. To determine the relative roles of tumor and
inflammatory cell–produced MMP-9 and the relative effect of
amino-biphosphonate treatment, we used bone marrow chimeras
to knock down MMP-9 gene expression in cells of hemopoietic
origin that become part of tumor stromal microenvironment. We
tested the effects on MDSC immunosuppression by combining
amino-biphosphonates with vaccination in function of tumor onset
and growth, as well as induction and maintenance of anti–r-p185/
HER-2 antibody response.

Materials and Methods
Mice and treatments. BALB-neuT mice were bred and maintained in
the animal facility at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori, according to the
national and institutional guidelines. Normal 8 to 10-week-old BALB/c,
C57BL/6, and FVB mice were purchased from Charles River. F1 hybrids
were obtained by mating BALB-neuT males with C57BL/6 or FVB females.
The hemizygous transgenic females were identified by PCR performed at
age 3 weeks (24).
MMP-9+/ mice on C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by Dr. Leif
Lund (Panum Institute, Department of Experimental Medicine, University
of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark) as N17 generation. They were
backcrossed to BALB/c and the N6 generation, intercrossed to obtain either
homozygous MMP-9 / and heterozygous MMP-9+/ offspring to be used
as bone marrow donors.
Zoledronate (Zometa; Novartis Europharm, Ltd.) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg
or pamidronate (Faulding Pharmaceuticals) at a dose of 2 mg/kg were
diluted in saline and administered daily s.c. 5 days a week. Mice were
weighed weekly, and the drug concentration was adjusted to their effective
weight. Control mice received 0.2 mL of saline daily s.c. To control
treatment nephrotoxicity, mice creatinine serum level was monitored after
12, 17, and 23 weeks of treatment by the colorimetric Jaffè method (25).
Immunotherapy was administered to (FVBBALB neuT)F1 females
starting at 7 weeks and repeated at ages 9, 11, and 13 weeks. Plasmid DNA
encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domain (ECD-TM) of the rat
p185-HER-2 (26) was prepared using the EndoFree Plasmid Giga kit (Qiagen
SpA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Mice under ketamine/
xylazine anesthesia were injected into the dorsal side of both ears with
0.05 mg of DNA in 0.05 mL of saline. A group of mice that received DNA
vaccination were already treated with Zoledronate 0.1 mg/d s.c. starting at
age 4 weeks.
All treated and control transgenic females were monitored weekly for
mammary tumor development and progression and for myeloid cell
expansion in the peripheral blood (PB). Mammary tumors were measured
by calipers and tumor volume expressed as (l 2  L), where l represents the
shorter diameter and L the longer one. The sum of the single tumor
volumes represented the overall tumor volume, whereas tumor multiplicity
was the number of mammary glands with a measurable tumor.
Immunohistochemistry and cytofluorimetric analysis. For immunohistochemistry, mammary tumors were included in optimum cutting
temperature compound and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Acetone-fixed
5-Am cryostat sections were placed in 3% H2O2/methanol solution for 5 min
to block endogenous peroxidase activity, rinsed in PBS, blocked in 5% FCS
for 20 min, and immunostained with Abs anti-CD11b/CD18 (clone M1/70.5;
BD Bioscience), anti–Gr-1 (clone RB6-8C5; BD Bioscience), anti-F4/80
(clone CI, A3-1; Caltag/Invitrogen), anti–MMP-9 (MAB 13415; Chemicon
International), anti-CD31 (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; BD
Bioscience).
After washing, sections were overlaid with biotinylated antimouse or
antirat Ab (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. Unbound immunoglobulin was
removed by washing, and slides were incubated with avidin-peroxidase
complex (DAKO) and revealed with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (Sigma Aldrich).
Sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin, dehydrated in
graded alcohol (70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol), and mounted in BDH
mounting medium (Merck). All immunostainings were repeated five times

with multiple sections, including negative controls for determination of
background staining. All images were digitally captured on a microscope
(Eclipse E-1000; Nikon) equipped with a digital camera (DXM1200; Nikon)
and analyzed using ACT-1 software.
Analysis of circulating MDSC was done as described (2): 0.2 mL of PB was
collected from retroorbital sinus and mixed with equal volume of 5 mmol/L
EDTA, erythrocytes were lysed by hypotonic shock in NH4Cl lysis buffer, and
leukocytes were counted. Cells were blocked with 10 Ag/mL of rat
antimouse CD16/CD32 Ab (clone 2.4G2; BD PharMingen) before staining
with the combination of rat antimouse FITC-Gr-1 and PE-CD11b Abs
(Caltag/Invitrogen) at 5 Ag/mL (5 Ag/106 cells) in 2% bovine serum albumin
(BSA), 0.05% azide in PBS for 40 min in ice. Cells were washed thrice in PBS2% BSA and analyzed by FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson) for doublepositive cells.
To analyze the tumor stroma, spontaneous mammary tumors were
removed, minced in 2 mL Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) buffer
containing collagenase D (1 mg/mL), and incubated 40 min at 37jC. The
enzymatic digestion was stopped with 2 mL of HBBS/5 mol/L EDTA, and
the tumor was reduced to a single-cell suspension by gently pipetting with
syringe and then filtering through a 70-Am cell strainer (Falcon; Becton
Dickinson Labware Europe). Cells were processed and immunostained as
described above with combinations of PE-CD11b with FITC-Gr-1, FITC-F4/
80 (all from Caltag) or FITC-CD11c (clone HL-3; BD PharMingen), or
combination of FITC- and PE-conjugated isotypic controls (BD PharMingen). Analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur E2551 cytometer (Becton
Dickinson). Data were collected on 104 viable cells and analyzed using
CellQuest software.
VEGF and pro–MMP-9 detection. Blood from treated and untreated
mice was collected from the retroorbital sinus and allowed to clot at room
temperature for 2 h. After centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min, serum was
transferred, aliquoted, and stored frozen until assayed. Serum VEGF and
pro–MMP-9 were measured by sandwich ELISA using the Murine VEGF
Development kit (Peprotech, Inc.) and the Quantikine pro–MMP-9 ELISA
kit (R&D System), respectively, according to manufacturer’s instruction.
Bone marrow colony forming units assay. Bone marrow cells were
obtained by flushing femurs and tibiae with 1 mL of Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Life Technologies Invitrogen Corp.) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FCS (Bio Whittaker Europe), using a 22-g
needle attached to a 1-mL syringe. Bone marrow cells were gently aspirated
several times using the same syringe to obtain a single-cell suspension, and
erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis with NH4Cl buffer.
Bone marrow cell suspensions were diluted to 2  105 cells/mL in IMDM
2% FCS medium, and 0.3 mL of cells were mixed with 3 mL of MethoCult
GF M3434 complete methylcellulose medium (StemCell Technologies, Inc.).
Cells were plated in duplicate in 35-mm dishes, at 2 to 2.5  104 cells/dish,
and incubated for 13 days at 37jC and a 5% CO2-humidified incubator.
Colonies were scored for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit
(CFU-GM), colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) morphology at days 7, 10, and 13, and the sum of all three types was recorded
as bone marrow–colony-forming unit (CFU).
Bone marrow transplantation. Groups of 7- to 8-week-old (C57Bl6xBALBneuT)F1 females were lethally irradiated with a total dose of 950 cGy given
in two doses with a 3-h interval. Mice were injected i.v. with bone marrow
cells (107 cells/mouse) obtained from MMP-9–/– or MMP-9+/ mice.
Bone marrow engraftment was monitored by immunofluorescence for
disappearance of MHC H-2Kb and expression of H-2Kd on PB lymphocytes.
Nontransplanted irradiated control mice died within 2 weeks.
Half of the transplanted mice were treated daily with Zoledronate
starting at age 7 weeks, whereas the others were injected daily with saline.
Cytofluorimetric evaluation of anti–r-p185/HER-2 response. Sera
were collected from treated and control (FVBBALB-neuT)F1 mice
beginning 4 weeks after the last DNA vaccination and every 15 days
thereafter. The presence of anti–r-p185/HER-2 antibodies was analyzed by
flow cytometry, using the N202-1A and N202-1E cell lines, respectively,
positive and negative for r-p185/HER-2 (27). Cells (5  105) were incubated
for 30 min in ice with 0.1 mL of test sera or control normal serum diluted in

PBS-2% BSA-0.05% azide. After washing in the same buffer, cells were
incubated for 30 min with 1:60 dilution of biotinylated goat antimouse IgG
(Amersham) followed by 1:150 dilution of streptavidin-PE (BD PharMingen).
Cells were washed, resuspended in PBS-2% BSA, and analyzed by a
FACSCalibur E2551 cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Data were collected on
104 viable cells and analyzed using CellQuest software. Sera recognizing only
N202-1A and not N202-1E were considered positive for anti–r-p185/HER-2
antibody response.
The specific serum-binding potential, calculated according to Quaglino
et al. (28), is as follows: (% of positive cells with test serum  fluorescence
mean) (% of positive cells with control serum  fluorescence mean) 
serum dilution.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad
Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Data comparing differences
between two groups were assessed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s
t test with 95% confidence interval and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney
test. Differences were considered significant when the P value is <0.05.

with zoledronate and tested its effect on MMP-9, trying to
distinguish tumor- and stroma-derived MMP-9.
To test whether the expression of MMP-9 in tumors from BALBneuT mice was responsible for the increased VEGF detectable in
serum and for myeloid cell expansion during tumor progression,
we examined the amino-biphosphonate–treated mice in greater
detail. Regardless of the starting age, zoledronate treatment
significantly decreased both pro–MMP-9 (P = 0.0009) and VEGF
(P = 0.001) in the serum of tumor-bearing BALB-neuT mice
(Fig. 3A) along with decreased tumor size, suggesting that impaired
MMP-9 production within the tumor environment results in a
reduction of VEGF detectable systemically. This confirms the key
role of MMP-9 in the regulation of VEGF availability for the cognate
receptors (17) and of VEGF-mediated recruitment of myeloid cells
to sites of inflammation (31, 32).
In fact, amino-biphosphonate treatment also significantly
reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells that stained
positively for CD11b, Gr-1, and F4/80 within the tumor stroma,

MMP-9 expression in BALB-neuT mice and its downmodulation by amino-biphosphonates in mammary tumors.
BALB-neuT mice develop multiple, multifocal mammary carcinomas whose progression is associated with expansion of MDSC and
increased serum level of VEGF (2). Because VEGF availability to its
receptor VEGFR-2/Flk is regulated by MMP-9 (17), we investigated
MMP-9 expression during mammary tumor progression. We
detected increased levels of pro–MMP-9 in sera of tumor-bearing,
but not tumor-free, BALB-neuT females by ELISA (Fig. 1A), and
immunohistochemistry revealed high levels of MMP-9 expression
in leukocytes scattered within the stroma, as well as a lower
expression in tumor cells of untreated mice (Fig. 1B). MMP-9
expression by mammary tumor cells was confirmed by Western
blot analysis of tumor cell lines derived from primary tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S1). To test whether MMP-9 expression, VEGF
secretion, and MDSC expansion are related, we treated BALBneuT mice with amino-biphosphonates that have been reported
to reduce MMP-9 production by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in normal- and tumor-infiltrating macrophages (23, 29).
According to their relative efficacy (30), pamidronate and zoledronate were given at 2 and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively, starting at ages
4, 7, or 12 weeks and continued daily to the age of 28 weeks.
Although prolonged amino-biphosphonate administration can
induce nephrotoxicity, creatinine serum levels monitored after 12,
17, and 23 weeks of treatment and weekly body weight did not
show difference between treated and control mice (data not
shown), indicating that repeated administration of zoledronate
or pamidronate at the indicated doses has apparently no toxicity
in mice.
Mice treated before (4 wk) or at the time of hyperplasia (7 wk)
with either pamidronate or zoledronate showed delayed tumor
onset, reduced number of transformed mammary glands, as well as
decreased volume of outgrowing tumors. Also at 12 weeks, when
mice have already numerous in situ carcinomas detectable by
whole-mount analysis, the treatment was still effective in reducing
the overall tumor volume (Fig. 2A). The group of mice treated
from the age of 4 weeks showed a statistically significant reduction
in the overall tumor volume at any time point compared with the
other groups of treatment, suggesting that amino-biphosphonates
act early during mammary cells transformation or that the more
prolonged is the treatment, the stronger is the tumor growth
inhibition (Fig. 2B). In absence of any significant differences
between pamidronate and zoledronate, we continued our study

as shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig. 3B).
Immunostaining confirmed that amino-biphosphonates reduced
tumor infiltrating and stromal leukocytes and inhibited MMP-9
expression in both stroma and tumor cells (Fig. 3C).
However, despite VEGF reduction, CD31 immunostaining of
mammary tumors of equal size from either treated or untreated
mice did not show difference in blood vessel number, distribution,
and organization (data not shown). This suggests that decreased
levels of VEGF, per se, did not impair tumor angiogenesis,
likely because of redundant proangiogenic circuits existing in
tumors (33).
Effects of zoledronate on hematopoiesis driven by tumorsecreted VEGF. Based on the above results, we next investigated
whether amino-biphosphonates have any activity on tumorinduced hyperactive bone marrow hematopoiesis. Zoledronate
treatment started at age 4 weeks significantly reduced myeloid cell
expansion in the peripheral blood (Fig. 4A). However, Gr-1/CD11b–
positive cells remaining in treated mice were as immunosuppressive as those from control mice, when added to CD3-stimulated
BALB/c splenocytes at the same ratio, confirming their MDSC
nature (data not shown).
Although smaller tumors should release lower amount of factors
conditioning the bone marrow, the observed decrease was even
higher than that expected from the decreased tumor size; it is of
note that to obtain a similar number of circulating Gr-1/CD11b–
positive cells, zoledronate-treated tumors would have to be six to
eight times larger than untreated tumors (Fig. 4B). These data
indicate that zoledronate impairs the bone marrow conditioning in
addition to its effects on tumor size.
To determine the nature of this inhibitory effect, we asked
whether amino-bisphosphonate affects the number of clonogenic

www.aacrjournals.org

colony-forming progenitor cells present in bone marrow. The
clonogenic assay in methylcellulose medium showed a significant
reduction (P = 0.0005) in the total number of colonies from bone
marrow of treated than untreated mice (Fig. 4C). Particularly the
number of CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM was significantly decreased
in bone marrow from treated mice (P = 0.0056 and P < 0.0001,
respectively; data not shown). These results confirm that aminobiphosphonates impair both expansion of bone marrow progenitor cells and tumor growth. To rule out any toxic effect of
amino-biphosphonates on normal hemopoietic precursors, we
treated BALB/c mice with zoledronate for 16 weeks before
testing their bone marrow cells for colony formation. Virtually
identical number of colonies were obtained from bone marrow of
treated and untreated mice, indicating that the action of
zoledronate is confined to tumor-enhanced but not normal
hematopoiesis (Fig. 4D).
Genetic ablation of MMP-9 in bone marrow–derived
stromal cells dissects the effects of zoledronate on tumor
growth and bone marrow hematopoiesis. To investigate the
distinct roles of MMP-9 produced by the tumor cells (low level
expressed by almost every cell) and by the stromal leukocytes (high
level in just a few cells scattered throughout the tumor; Fig. 1B),
during tumor development and hemopoietic conditioning, we
produced bone marrow chimeras. Bone marrow cells from MMP-9
knockout (MMP-9 / ) or competent (MMP-9+/ ) mice were
transplanted into transgenic mice, and tumor onset and progression as well as bone marrow conditioning were monitored. In both
types of chimera, the tumor-derived MMP-9 would be present.
Spontaneous mammary tumors developed in bone marrow
chimeras transplanted with either MMP-9 / or MMP-9+/ bone
marrow, with similar kinetics and progression (Fig. 5A; open

symbols). Immunohistochemistry revealed a comparable number
and distribution of CD11b and F4/80 positive cells in tumors from
both types of chimeras (Supplementary Fig. S2A–B). In parallel with
tumor development, MMP-9+/ >neuT chimeric mice underwent
hematopoietic expansion showing increased number of bone
marrow colonies, whereas in the MMP-9 / >neuT chimeras, the
colony number was not significantly different from bone marrow of
normal BALB/c mice (Fig. 5B; open symbols). These data suggest
that leukocyte-produced MMP-9 is dispensable for infiltration,
stroma organization, and outgrowth (Fig. 5A) but is necessary to
trigger bone marrow hyperplastic hematopoiesis through VEGF
availability (Fig. 5B).
Indeed, pro–MMP-9 and VEGF serum levels were increased in tumor-bearing MMP-9+/ >neuT chimeras but not in

MMP-9 / >neuT chimeras (Fig. 5C–D; open symbols). In the
MMP-9 / >neuT chimeras, the low amount of MMP-9 produced
by tumor cells is insufficient to increase VEGF availability to
the threshold necessary to activate the tumor-enhanced bone
marrow hematopoiesis. In these mice, the radio-resistant stroma
within bone marrow produces enough MMP-9 to support normal
proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells
(Fig. 5B; refs. 15, 34).
Treatment with zoledronate inhibited tumor growth in both
MMP-9+/ >neuT and MMP-9 / >neuT bone marrow chimeras
(Fig. 5A; filled symbols), and dramatically decreased the number
of CD11b- and F4/80-positive cells within tumor stroma (Supplementary Fig. S2C–D). Treated tumors were necrotic regardless of
the MMP-9 genotype of stroma cell. In MMP-9+/ >neuT mice,

zoledronate significantly decreased serum pro–MMP-9 (P = 0.011)
and VEGF (P = 0.018; Fig. 5C–D, respectively) and reduced the
number of bone marrow methylcellulose colonies (P = 0.002;
Fig. 5B).
In the MMP-9 / >neuT chimeras treated with zoledronate,
the normal levels of pro–MMP-9 and VEGF did not decrease
(Fig. 5C–D) but the number of bone marrow CFU were significantly
decreased (P = 0.003; Fig. 5B), suggesting that zoledronate have
some effects on the MMP-9 produced by the radio-resistant bone
marrow stroma (34).
Because MMP-9 is required for bone marrow recovery after bone
marrow ablation, we tested whether amino-biphosphonates have
any suppressive effects on normal hematopoiesis. We treated
BALB-neuT and BALB/c mice with zoledronate and then ablated
the bone marrow using 5-fluorouracil (5FU). 5FU treatment
severely decreased cell number in peripheral blood, spleen, and
bone marrow within 6 days, as well as bone marrow and spleen
colonies in methylcellulose. Fourteen days later, the recovery of
bone marrow colonies (CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM, and BFU-E) was
normal in BALB/c mice regardless zoledronate treatment, whereas
such recovery was impaired in treated BALB-neuT mice (Supplementary Fig. S3). These data confirm that zoledronate has no
suppressive effect on normal hematopoiesis, although it reduces
the effect of excessive MMP-9 produced at tumor site.
Zoledronate treatment improves immunotherapy outcome
by reducing MDSC. The MMP-9/VEGF loop induces MDSC, which
are reduced by zoledronate treatment. We therefore asked whether
such MDSC reduction might improve the response to immunotherapy. To assess whether there was synergy between zoledronate
and immunotherapy, we used conditions in which immunotherapy
alone is insufficient to prevent tumor onset. BALB-neuT mice were
crossed to FVB because this F1 hybrid develops accelerated

tumorigenesis. Groups of (FVBBALB-neuT)F1 females were
either treated or not with zoledronate starting at age 4 weeks
and vaccinated with a plasmid DNA encoding the rat p185/Her-2
ECD-TM four times at ages 7, 9, 11, and 13 weeks.
Zoledronate alone reduced tumor outgrowth, confirming the
results of Fig. 2 in a different genetic background. Also, immunotherapy as single treatment delayed tumor onset, although it
was unable to protect mice from tumor outgrowth (data not
shown).
Combining zoledronate with immunotherapy further delayed
tumor onset and significantly inhibited tumor growth at any time
point, compared with untreated controls (P = 0.002–0.004; data not
shown). Although zoledronate did not improve the outcome of
vaccination using this schedule, a higher number of mice receiving
the combination therapy had smaller tumor mass along the
observation time (Fig. 6A). Evaluation of groups of mice bearing
the same number of transformed mammary glands, regardless of
mouse age, showed a cumulative tumor volume significantly
smaller in mice receiving zoledronate in addition to DNA
vaccination than in mice receiving DNA vaccination alone (Fig. 6B).
The number of MDSC in the peripheral blood was significantly
reduced in all treated mice compared with untreated controls
(P = 0.01–0.0004). When the percentage of circulating MDSC is
correlated with the tumor volume, mice vaccinated and treated
with zoledronate had a disproportionately decreased level of MDSC
and, thus, needed a significant larger tumor size to induce the same
percentage of circulating MDSC than untreated (P = 0.008) or
vaccinated mice (P = 0.006; Fig. 6C).
Because in this immunotherapy model, DNA vaccination induces
an antibody response against the rat p185/HER-2, mice were tested
for the presence of antibody recognizing the HER-2 antigen. As
expected, immunotherapy alone induced a humoral anti–rat p185/

HER-2 response within 3 weeks after the last immunization.
Addition of zoledronate to DNA vaccination significantly increased
the titer of anti–r-p185/HER-2 Ab titer (Fig. 6D). This result
suggests that zoledronate-induced MMP-9 down-regulation inhibits MDSC generation, thus improving the antitumor immune
response triggered by DNA vaccination.

Discussion
In this study, we provide evidence for a vicious cycle that
connects tumor and bone marrow through MMP-9, produced in
the tumor microenvironment mainly by stromal cells of bone
marrow origin. The MMP-9 makes VEGF available to bone marrow
for mobilizing hemopoietic stem cells toward enhanced myelopoiesis. Our data show that MMP-9 increases with tumor progression,
and in parallel, the level of VEGF in serum increases. Inhibiting
MMP-9 expression at tumor site breaks this loop and normalizes
hematopoiesis, thus reducing myeloid support to tumor stroma
and MDSC generation. As MMP-9 inhibitor, we used aminobiphosphonates, namely pamidronate and zoledronate. This class
of biphosphonates interferes with the proteins prenylation and
with the conversion of mevalonate to geranylgeranylpyrophosphate
necessary for cholesterol synthesis (29). Therefore, they act on
multiple metabolic pathways and, depending on cell type, have
different effects: induce apoptosis and impair cell migration and
adhesion to mineralized supports in vitro (22, 35), inhibit
metastasis spread especially to bone (36, 37), and inhibit tumor
neoangiogenesis by impairing VEGF signaling and MMP-9
expression by stromal macrophages (23) in vivo.
Treatment with amino-biphosphonates induced growth inhibition in BALB-neuT mice model of aggressive autologous

tumorigenesis. Besides inhibiting MMP-9 expression, aminobiphosphonates reduced the number of CD11b- and F4/80-positive
leukocytes in tumor stroma, thus depriving the tumor from the
trophic effect provided by macrophages. The invasion of premalignant mammary lesions by macrophages precedes the angiogenic
switch and is necessary for the progression to carcinoma in the
PyMT model (38). This fits with the idea that tumor-educated
macrophages promote tumor progression by secreting growth
factors, cytokines, MMPs, and nitric oxide for proliferation
and angiogenesis (39–41). Even macrophages recruited within
tumors by adenovirus-mediated chemokine gene expression
acquire the same M2 phenotype of preexisting macrophages,
and tumor-associated macrophages are viewed as target for cancer
therapy (42).
Our study shows that decreasing pro–MMP-9 serum levels
reduces VEGF availability for angiogenesis and myelopoiesis. Of
interest, the effect on bone marrow hematopoiesis seems to
precede any effect on tumor growth. Indeed, to obtain a similar
number of circulating MDSC, mice treated with zoledronate
should have a tumor mass six to eight times larger than that of
untreated mice. The decrease of MDSC was due to the
normalization of hematopoiesis, as shown by counting methylcellulose colonies from bone marrow of treated tumor-bearing mice:
particularly CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM precursors of circulating
MDSC were significantly decreased (P = 0.005 and P < 0.0001,
respectively).
Interestingly, zoledronate had no effect on normal hematopoiesis because chronically treated BALB/c mice had normal
bone marrow CFU number and type, and displayed a normal
recovery from temporary aplasia induced by the cytotoxic drug
5-FU. Unexpectedly and in contrast to the results in a cervical

carcinoma model (23), the decreased MMP-9 and VEGF at tumor
site did not impair angiogenesis. It is possible that the
redundancy of proangiogenic circuits can bypass the block of
VEGF perhaps through up-regulation of fibroblast growth factor,
ephrin, and angiopoietin-1 produced by tumor and endothelial
cells (33).
To dissect the role of MMP-9 produced by either tumor or
stroma cells of hemopoietic origin and their relative sensitivity to
zoledronate, we used bone marrow chimeras to knock down MMP9 in bone marrow–derived cells. Regardless of the donor genotype,
BALB-neuT chimeras developed tumors with similar onset and
progression. Tumors also showed similar stroma composition in
terms of infiltrating F4/80-CD11b cells. Thus, it might be possible
that the MMP-9 produced by tumor cells is sufficient for the local
tissue remodeling and angiogenesis. In contrast, the higher amount
of MMP-9 produced by the cells of myeloid origin that infiltrate the
tumor had distant effects on bone marrow; its knock down in
MMP-9 / >neuT chimeras reduced VEGF serum level and
normalized hematopoiesis.
Zoledronate inhibited tumor growth in both MMP-9 / and
MMP-9+/ >BALB-neuT chimeras, decreasing the number of
macrophages within the tumor and breaking the vicious circle
between tumor stroma and bone marrow. In MMP-9 /
chimeras, zoledronate further decreased the number of CFU
obtained from bone marrow without being toxic on normal
hematopoiesis, neither was zoledronate toxic on hematopoiesis
that rescued temporary aplasia induced by 5FU. Because tumors
are responsible for enhanced hematopoiesis in tumor-bearing
mice, normalization of bone marrow CFU suggests that

www.aacrjournals.org

zoledronate acts preferentially on tumor, while sparing bone
marrow hemopoietic stem cells.
Finally, MDSC reduction in peripheral blood and secondary
lymphoid organs contributes to the induction of immune response
after vaccination immunotherapy.
Clinical trials with various MMP inhibitors (MMPI) were
mostly unsuccessful (16, 19). Because several MMPs contribute
differently to the various stages of tumor progression, the effect
of MMPI may be quite different in early and late tumor stages.
For this particular reason, MMP-9 has been reconsidered as a
more specific target for pharmacological inhibitors (16, 20).
Amino-biphosphonates represent a class of MMPI with excellent
safety and tolerance (43), and display therapeutic effects beyond
MMP-9 inhibition. In cancer patients, a single dose of
pamidronate and zoledronate decreases serum levels of VEGF,
platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor h, and
MMP-2 (44–46); thus supporting the idea of their multifactorial
effects from blocking osteoclast bone resorption and CXCR-4–
guided metastases to inhibition of MMP-9 and activation of g-y
T lymphocytes (47–49). The tumor growth inhibition described
here may have contributions from several of these mechanisms
of action of amino-biphosphonates. Our study was focused on
the effect of amino-biphosphonates on MMP-9 responsible for
the tumor–bone marrow loop in BALB-neuT model. Mice have
shown no toxicity to prolonged treatment and to a cumulative
dose that might be toxic in humans (50). Future experiments
will dose zoledronate to clinical-safe regimen to test the effective
preclinical value of our findings. Nevertheless, in the BALB-neuT
model of spontaneous mammary carcinoma, we can conclude

that MMP-9 inhibition breaks the vicious loop linking tumor and
bone marrow in a reciprocal provision of growth factor (VEGF)
and cells fostering tumor growth (macrophage) and immune
suppression (MDSC), and that amino-biphosphonates can be
used as MMPI. Our results suggest the possibility to use the
amino-biphosphonates MMPI activity as adjuvant to contrast
tumor-induced hematopoietic and immunological disorders.
