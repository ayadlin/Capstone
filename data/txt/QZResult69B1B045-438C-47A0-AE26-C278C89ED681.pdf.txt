Abstract
As tumor development relies on a coordination of angiogenesis and tumor growth, an efficient antitumor strategy should
target both the tumor and its associated vessels. Tumor
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
induces apoptosis in a tumor-selective manner. Additionally,
thrombospondin-1, a naturally occurring inhibitor of angiogenesis, and a recombinant protein containing functional
domains of thrombospondin-1, 3TSR, have been shown to be
necessary and sufficient to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Here,
we show that a combination of a TRAIL receptor 2 agonist
antibody, Lexatumumab, and 3TSR results in a significantly
enhanced and durable tumor inhibition. We further observed
that 3TSR induces apoptosis in primary endothelial cells by
up-regulating the expression of TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 in a
CD36 and Jun NH2-terminal kinase-dependent manner leading
to the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
machineries. The modulation of these pathways is critical for
3TSR-induced apoptosis as disrupting either via specific
inhibitors reduced apoptosis. Moreover, 3TSR attenuates
the Akt survival pathway. These studies indicate that 3TSR
plays a critical role in regulating the proapoptotic signaling
pathways that control growth and death in endothelial cells
and that a combination of TRAIL and 3TSR acts as a double
hit against tumor and tumor-associated vessels. [Cancer Res
2009;69(9):3856–65]

Introduction
Apoptosis of endothelial cells is a prominent feature of blood
vessel remodeling (1–3) and may limit the undesired neovascularization of tumors (4). In mammalian systems, there are two
major apoptotic pathways. One is the intrinsic pathway, which is
triggered by many stress stimuli including chemotherapeutic
agents, UV irradiation, and p53 and leads to the release of
cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors from mitochondria
causing the activation of caspase-9 and downstream executioner
caspases (5). By contrast, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is
activated on binding of members of the tumor necrosis factor
family of ligands [e.g., tumor necrosis factor, Fas, and tumor

necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)] to their
cognate receptors (6–8). This interaction results in the recruitment
of apical procaspase-8, causing the formation of the death-inducing
signaling complex (5, 6, 9). Once formed, the death-inducing
signaling complex promotes the release of active caspase-8 to
directly activate caspase-3 and to trigger apoptosis. However, in
most cells (including cancer cells), caspase-8 inefficiently processes
caspase-3 (6). In these cells, death signaling bifurcates into two
arms, one of which engages mitochondria in a manner equivalent
to the intrinsic pathway (6, 10). The death receptor-induced
apoptotic pathway can also result in the activation of the stressactivated protein kinases including Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)
and p38 (4, 11). JNK and p38 have also been shown to be involved
in mediating apoptosis in some cell systems (12) through
transcriptional regulation of proapoptotic factors including some
death ligands and death receptors (11, 13, 14).
Currently, therapeutic strategies for the selective activation of
the intrinsic and/or extrinsic pathways in tumor cells are heavily
sought after (6, 9, 15–17). Because one of the physiologic roles of
TRAIL is in the immune response against transformed cells (18, 19),
and because exogenous TRAIL induces tumor-selective apoptosis,
TRAIL has great potential in cancer therapy (18). TRAIL and TRAIL
receptor agonist antibodies (Lexatumumab) are currently at
various stages of clinical trials (20, 21). These therapeutic agents
do not cause complete tumor regression when used as single
agents (22).
TSP-1 is one of several naturally occurring inhibitors of
angiogenesis (23) and a member of a family of high molecular
weight matricellular glycoproteins (24, 25). TSP-1 has been
reported to induce apoptosis of endothelial cells through activation
of CD36, p59fyn, caspase-3–like activity, and p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (2, 4, 26, 27). CD36 is the receptor for a functional
domain of TSP-1, known as the type 1 repeats (TSR). TSRs, or their
synthetic peptides, are the best mimetics of TSP-1, and one
peptide, designated ABT-510, is in clinical trials for cancer therapy
(26, 28–30). 3TSR is thought to inhibit tumor growth in vivo either
by directly targeting endothelial cells, leading to apoptosis of the
cells through mechanisms such as inhibition of Bcl-2 and
activation of caspase-3, or indirectly via inhibition of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release from the extracellular
matrix. These effects of 3TSR could result in the induction of
apoptosis in the tumor-associated endothelial cells, promoting
hypoxia and leading to tumor regression. However, in the tumor
models that have been studied, 3TSR alone is not sufficient to
cause complete inhibition of tumor growth. Additionally, the
molecular mechanisms through which TSP-1 and TSRs induce
activation of caspase-3 and promote CD36-mediated apoptosis
remain to be elucidated.

A Double Hit to Kill Tumor and Endothelial Cells

In this study, we have investigated the effectiveness of inhibiting
tumors and tumor-associated vessels by combining 3TSR and
Lexatumumab in a tumor model in vivo. We have further analyzed
the molecular mechanism by which 3TSR induces CD36-mediated
apoptosis of cultured primary human dermal microvascular
endothelial cells (HDMEC).

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Lexatumumab, a fully human agonist monoclonal antibody to
TRAIL receptor DR5, was a gift from Human Genome Sciences. Matrigel
(Matrigel basement membrane matrix) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Each of the following reagents was dissolved in DMSO for use: caspase8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK, and caspase-3
inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK were purchased from R&D Systems; the PI3K
inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin were purchased from Calbiochem and
Alexis Biochemicals, respectively; and SP600125 was purchased from
Biomol International. Protease inhibitor cocktail tablets were purchased
from Roche. Purified VEGF165, expressed in Sf21, was obtained from the
National Cancer Institute Preclinical Repository, Biological Resources
Branch. The following antibodies were used in our studies: monoclonal
antibody to CD36 (clone FA6-152; Immunotech, Coulter); mouse anticytochrome c monoclonal antibody (clone 7H8.2C12; BD Biosciences
Pharmingen); mouse IgG, GRB2 (C-23) polyclonal antibody, caspase-8 p20
(H134) polyclonal antibody, human caspase-9 p10 (H-83) polyclonal
antibody, Akt1/2 (H136), and anti-DR5/TRAIL receptor 2 (all from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); caspase-3 polyclonal antibody, human-specific caspase-9 polyclonal antibody, phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-SAPK/JNK
(Thr183/Tyr185), and SAPK/JNK (SC-827) antibodies (all from Cell Signaling
Technology); monoclonal anti-h-actin clone AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich); and
anti-DR4/TRAIL receptor 1 (Axxora).
3TSR production. A recombinant 3TSR was prepared using the
Drosophila expression vector system, pMT/BiP/V5-HisA (Invitrogen), as
described previously (31).
Cell culture. Four colon cancer cell lines, HT29, HCT116, SW480, and
COLO205, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HT29
and HCT116 cells are maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium with 1.5 mmol/L
L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). SW480 and COLO205 cells
are maintained in RPMI 1640 with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, 4.5 g/L glucose, and 10% FBS. HDMEC were isolated by the
procedure of Richard and colleagues (32). The cells were cultured in
Vitrogen-precoated dishes and/or 24-well plates, maintained in EBM-2
(Clonetics) containing 20% FBS, 1 mg/mL hydrocortisone acetate,
5  105 Amol/L dibutyryl-cAMP, 200 units/mL penicillin, 100 units/mL
streptomycin, and 250 mg/mL amphotericin, and grown to f80%
confluency. The cells were then cultured in EBM-2 containing 2% FBS
overnight and then switched into EBM-2 containing 0.5% FBS for the
experiment. HDMEC of passage 6 or 7 were used in the study. Jurkat cells
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 mg/mL
penicillin, 50 units/mL streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine. The cells
were switched into RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% FBS for the apoptosis
and kinase assays.
Xenograft tumor model and treatment. The human colon cancer
HCT116 or SW480 cells were mixed with Matrigel at 1:1 (v/v), and 100 AL of
the mixture (1  106 HCT116 cells or 8  106 SW480 cells) was injected
subcutaneously into the right flank of nu/nu mice (8 weeks old, female;
Charles River Laboratories). After f1 week when tumor volumes reached
100 to 150 mm3, mice were randomized among and regrouped such that
tumor volumes of all groups of mice were in the same range. After the
randomization, mice began to receive treatment. Lexatumumab was
delivered by tail vein (intravenous) injection at 3 mg/kg and given twice
weekly. 3TSR was injected intraperitoneally at 1 mg/kg/d. In vehicle control
group of mice, 0.9% saline (intravenous) and TSR buffer (intraperitoneal)
were used for injection on the same schedule as Lexatumumab and 3TSR
treatment groups. Tumor volume was measured using calipers in two

www.aacrjournals.org

dimensions. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: (width2 
length) / 2. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated using the
formula: TGI = (100 - treatment /control)  100. Some of the mice were
sacrificed at the indicated time points and the tumors were frozen
immediately or fixed in 10% formalin for further pathologic analysis. The
rest of the mice continued on the treatment.
Pathologic analysis. Major organs and tumor tissues were preserved in
10% formalin immediately after collection and processed into paraffin
embedding samples. Histology examination on major organ tissues was
carried out by H&E staining and microscopy. Detection of DR4 and DR5
expression in tumor samples was carried out by immunohistochemistry,
and evaluation of apoptosis was done by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as well as by
cleaved caspase-3 staining on slides at the Rodent Histopathology Core
Laboratory of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Frozen tumor
sections were used for double staining of CD31 and TUNEL as described
previously (33).
Apoptosis assay. Primary HDMEC were treated with 3TSR, TSP-1, and
camptothecin for 24 h. The cells were then trypsinized, collected, and
washed once with PBS. Colon carcinoma cells were treated with TRAIL as
indicated in the figure legend. The cells were then resuspended in
DNA staining buffer containing propidium iodide (Roche) and incubated
for 1 h at 4jC. The cell population was assayed by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System)
and CellQuest software was used for measuring the sub-G1 apoptotic cell
population, and 10,000 cells were analyzed for each condition. In addition,
the morphology of the endothelial cells was observed under a phasecontrast microscope and photos were taken with a CCD digital camera.
In parallel studies, the cells were grown on Lab-Tek chamber slides
coated with Vitrogen, and apoptosis was evaluated using a TUNEL assay
(Promega). After the cells were treated with 3TSR (2 Amol/L) or 3TSR buffer
for 24 h, the slides were washed twice with PBS. The cells were then fixed by
immersing the slides in freshly prepared 4% methanol-free formaldehyde
solution in PBS (pH7.4) for 25 min at 4jC and processed directly with the
apoptosis detection assay as described in the protocol by the manufacturer.
Vectashield and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) were
applied to stain nuclei and internal negative and positive controls were set
up for quality control.
Endothelial cell apoptosis was measured using tumor tissues 4 weeks
post-tumor inoculation. Frozen tissue sections (5 Am thick) were incubated
with rat monoclonal anti-CD31 antibody (BD Pharmingen) in a humidified
chamber for 15 to 18 h at 4jC, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with goat
anti-rat IgG conjugated to Texas red (Vector Laboratories) for 60 min at
ambient temperature in the dark. After sections were washed with PBS
containing 0.1% Brij 99 (v/v), TUNEL labeling was done using a commercial
kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Background
reactivity was determined by processing slides in the absence of terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (negative control); maximum reactivity was
observed by preincubating the tissue sections with DNase I to confirm the
quality of the specimen. Representative sections from two tumors per group
were analyzed with a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope. Endothelial cells
were identified by red fluorescence, and DNA fragmentation was detected
by localized green and yellow fluorescence within the nuclei of apoptotic
cells. Apoptotic endothelial cells were quantified and expressed as an
average of the ratio of apoptotic endothelial cells to the total number of
endothelial cells.
Assay of caspase activity. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities
were assayed in lysates from HDMEC treated with 2 Amol/L 3TSR for
24 h following the procedure described by the manufacturer (BD ApoAlert
Caspase Fluorescent Assay kits; BD Biosciences Pharmingen). In parallel
experiments, the caspase activities were also measured in the presence
of Z-IETD-fmk (20 Amol/L) or Z-LEHD-fmk (2 Amol/L) to determine the
specificity of caspase-8 or caspase-9 activities. Caspase-3 activity in
3TSR-treated cells (24 h) was also assayed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (BD ApoAlert Caspase Colorimetric Assay kit; BD Biosciences
Pharmingen). Caspase-3 activity was also measured in the presence of
Z-DEVD-fmk (40 Amol/L).

Figure 1. 3TSR and TRAIL cooperate in inhibiting colon cancer. A, human colon cancer SW480 cells were implanted into the right flank of nu/nu mice. Seven days
post-implantation, mice were injected daily with Lexatumumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) and 3TSR (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or 0.9% saline and TSR buffer. Mean
from 10 mice in each group (n = 10). By treatment day 31, ANOVA indicates P < 0.01 for Lexatumumab versus vehicle, P < 0.001 for 3TSR versus vehicle, P < 0.001 for
Lexatumumab + 3TSR versus vehicle, and P < 0.05 for Lexatumumab + 3TSR versus Lexatumumab. By day 31, TGI = 60% for Lexatumumab, TGI = 69% for
3TSR, and TGI = 93% for Lexatumumab + 3TSR. B, immunohistochemical staining on SW480 tumor sections for TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3. SW480 xenograft
tumors were collected from three mice from each treatment group on day 28 after tumor cell inoculation. Similar results were observed from tumor samples of
three mice from each treatment group. Original photos were taken at 200 magnification. C, analysis of tumor vasculature endothelial cell apoptosis. The apoptosis
of tumor-associated vascular endothelial cells was evaluated via double labeling of CD31 and TUNEL. 3TSR significantly induced apoptosis of tumor vascular
endothelial cells (P = 0.001 versus vehicle control), whereas Lexatumumab (Lexa ) treatment showed little effect on tumor vascular endothelial cell apoptosis. The
combination of Lexatumumab and 3TSR resulted in a similar level of endothelial cell apoptosis as with 3TSR alone (*, P < 0.001 versus control). D, growth of HCT116
colon cancer xenograft in nude mice. Tumor implantation and treatments were same as A , except 1  106 cells were used for implantation. Points, mean from 12 mice
in each group (n = 12). By treatment day 41, statistical analysis by ANOVA indicates P < 0.01 for Lexatumumab versus vehicle, P < 0.05 for 3TSR versus vehicle,
P < 0.001 for Lexatumumab + 3TSR versus vehicle, and P < 0.05 for Lexatumumab + 3TSR versus 3TSR. By treatment day 41, TGI = 46% for Lexatumumab,
TGI = 36% for 3TSR, and TGI = 68% for Lexatumumab + 3TSR.

Detection of cytochrome c release into cytosol. Cell fractionation on
HDMEC and Jurkat cells was done as described in the MBL cytochrome c
assay protocol (MBL). The supernatant was collected as a cytosolic fraction
for Western blot analysis.
Western blot analysis. The cells were washed once with ice-cold
PBS, rapidly lysed in lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol,
1% Triton X-100, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 25 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, 2 mmol/L p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.5 mmol/L
Pefabloc (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; Roche
Applied Science), 10 mg/mL aprotinin, 1 mmol/L sodium pervanadate, and

protease inhibitor cocktail (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin,
Pefabloc SC, leupeptin, a2-macroglobulin, EDTA, bestatin, pepstatin, and
E64)], and incubated for 10 min on ice. Total cell lysates were then
centrifuged at 13,000  g for 15 min at 4jC. Protein concentration was
assayed with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The cytosolic and
mitochondrial fractions were prepared as described above. Western blot
analyses were done as follows: SDS sample buffer was added to cell lysates
(total, cytosol, and mitochondria fractions), samples were boiled, and
proteins were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by transferring the
separated proteins to Immobilon transfer membranes (Millipore) and

immunoreaction with specific antibodies. The immunoreactive protein was
then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Gene expression
in the primary microvascular endothelial cells treated with 3TSR (1 Amol/L)
or buffer control was assessed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR
following the protocol of Ghaffari and colleagues (34). The primers for
DR4 and DR5 as well as GAPDH are as follows: human DR4 forward
5¶-CAATGCTGATGAAATGGGTCA-3¶ and reverse 5¶-GCATCCAGCAGGGTGTGG-3¶, human DR5 forward 5¶-CTCCTGAGATGTGCCGGAA-3¶ and
reverse 5¶-ATCACCGACCTTGACCATCC-3¶, and human GAPDH forward
5¶-GGTTTCGGTCGTATCGGACG-3 and reverse 5¶-TTGGTCACCAGTGTAAGC-3¶. GAPDH transcripts were amplified in a separate tube to
normalize variances in input RNA. The relative Ct value was used to
compare the fold change of mRNA expression.
Akt activation assay. To determine the effects of 3TSR on Akt
phosphorylation, the primary HDMEC were cultured in 2% FBS/EBM-2
overnight. 3TSR buffer control, 3TSR, and LY294002 were added for 9 h to
the cells in 0.5% FBS/EBM-2. VEGF was added at the same time or at the
last 15, 30, and 60 min of the 9 h incubation. Akt activation was assayed by
Western blot with phosphospecific Akt antibody phospho-Akt (Ser473; Cell
Signaling Technology). Akt1/2 (H136:sc-8312) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
and monoclonal anti-h-actin clone AC-15 (Sigma) were used to detect total
Akt and h-actin on the same or duplicate membranes, respectively.
JNK activation assay. To determine the effects of 3TSR on JNK
phosphorylation, the primary HDMEC were cultured in 2% FBS/EBM-2
overnight. After the cells were pretreated with JNK-specific inhibitor
SP600125 (10 Amol/L) and FA6-152 (20 Ag/mL) for 30 min, 3TSR buffer
control or 3TSR was added for 30 and 60 min. Western blotting was used to
detect phosphorylation levels of SAPK/JNK.

Nucleofection. The primary dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(5  105, passage 6) were grown in freshly prepared 20% FBS/EBM-2 and
nucleofected with the pcDNA3.1 plasmid and the plasmid encoding myr-Akt
with a protocol optimized for human microvascular endothelial cells by
using the HMVEC-L nucleofector kit and Amaxa nucleofector (Amaxa
Biosystems). After nucleofection for 36 h, the cells were switched to 2% FBS/
EBM-2 overnight and treated with 3TSR or 3TSR buffer for 24 h for an
apoptosis assay; parallel cell lysate was obtained for detection of total Akt
and phospho-Akt expression.
Xenograft tumor model, treatment, and pathologic analysis. The
human colon cancer HCT116 or SW480 cells were used for generation of
xenograft tumor model as described previously (35, 36).

Results
Combination treatment with 3TSR and TRAIL leads to
cooperative tumor inhibition in vivo. A successful strategy for
cancer therapy may involve selective inhibition of tumors in
conjunction with inhibition of tumor-associated endothelial cells.
To investigate the in vivo effectiveness of Lexatumumab and
3TSR combination, we chose several human colon cancer cell
lines, HT29, HCT116, SW480, and COLO205. We first tested
these cell lines in growth medium containing vehicle (control)
or Lexatumumab (2 Ag/mL) for 24 h, and apoptosis was quantified
by measuring sub-G1 apoptotic cell population. All four cell
lines treated with Lexatumumab showed an increase of 30% to
76% in the level of apoptosis compared with the control cells

Figure 2. 3TSR induces apoptosis of HDMEC. A, primary HDMEC were treated with 3TSR, TSP-1, and camptothecin at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. The
apoptotic cell population was assayed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and indicated that 3TSR-mediated apoptosis increased in a dose-dependent
manner. B, phase-contrast microscopy showed that 3TSR-treated cells have a rounded/apoptotic morphology and are positive for TUNEL staining. C, HDMEC
were preincubated with anti-CD36 antibody FA6-152 for 1 h before adding 3TSR. Apoptotic cell population was measured as in A and showed that 3TSR-mediated
apoptosis is dependent on the activity of the CD36 receptor.

Figure 3. 3TSR stimulates caspase-8,
caspase-3, and cytochrome c release from
mitochondria and promotes activation of
caspase-9 in HDMEC. A, HDMEC cells
were treated with buffer (CTL), 3TSR,
hTSP-1, and caspase-8 (z-IEDT-fmk),
caspase-3 (z-DEVD-fmk), or caspase-9
(z-LEHD-fmk) inhibitor. Caspase cleavage
was detected by Western blotting with
specific caspase-8. Caspase-3 or
caspase-9 antibodies. Jurkat cells treated
with TRAIL in the presence or absence of
z-IETD-fmk were used as controls.
B, cytochrome c (Cyt C ) levels in
mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were
determined by Western blotting after
treatment of cells with 2 or 5 Amol/L 3TSR
or buffer. Jurkat cells treated with or
without Fas ligand for 6 h were used as
controls. Western blot analysis indicated
that the mitochondrial preparations were
free of GRB2, a protein that is normally
excluded from mitochondria. C, HDMEC
were treated with 3TSR in the absence or
presence of the caspase-8 inhibitor
z-IETD-fmk, the caspase-9 inhibitor
z-LRHD-fmk, either alone or in
combination, and the caspase-3 inhibitor
z-DEVD-fmk. Camptothecin was used as a
positive control for induction of apoptosis in
endothelial cells. Mean F SD of three
separate experiments.

(Supplementary Fig. S1A) but were not responsive to 3TSR
(Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Based on these findings, we chose two cell lines, HCT116 and
SW480, which had partial but significant response to Lexatumumab. These cells were subcutaneously injected in nude mice
to generate tumor xenografts. One week after tumor injections,
the mice with HCT116 or SW480 were divided into four groups
receiving vehicle control, Lexatumumab at 3 mg/kg twice a
week, 3TSR at 1 mg/kg/d, and a combination of Lexatumumab
at 3 mg/kg twice a week and 3TSR at 1 mg/kg/d.
In the SW480 xenograft tumor model, treatment with Lexatumumab alone or 3TSR alone started to show tumor inhibition as
early as 1 week after treatment. Increased tumor inhibition in the
combination group, compared with the Lexatumumab or 3TSR
group, was evident as early as day 10 after treatment. As the
treatment continued, tumor growth in the combination treatment
group was almost completely inhibited: 93% by day 31 after
treatment compared with 60% for the Lexatumumab group and
69% for the 3TSR group. The result of inhibition on tumor growth
in the combination group can clearly be visualized from the mice
bearing SW480 tumors on day 31 after treatment compared with
other groups (Fig. 1A).
To investigate whether a combination of Lexatumumab and
3TSR can result in a durable tumor inhibition, we stopped
treatment of 6 mice after 31 days. Whereas tumor growth resumed

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

in Lexatumumab- or 3TSR-treated mice, leading to their sacrifice
by day 100 due to tumor burden, combined treatment with
Lexatumumab and 3TSR led to delayed tumor regrowth in most of
the mice and no tumor growth in two mice (n = 6). The latter two
mice remained tumor-free for 5 months after treatment was
terminated (data not shown).
Pathologic analysis of the SW480 xenograft tumor specimens
revealed that there were apoptotic tumor areas in Lexatumumabtreated as well as 3TSR-treated mice as evidenced by positive
staining of TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 1B). However,
TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity was much more prominent
in the tumor tissue from the combination Lexatumumab- and
3TSR-treated mice (Fig. 1B). More importantly, H&E staining of
lung, kidney, liver, and heart showed normal cellular architecture in
normal tissues, indicating that 3TSR does not cause a generalized
toxicity to other tissues and organs (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Finally, a costaining of tumors 4 weeks post-tumor inoculation with
CD31, which stains endothelial cells, and TUNEL showed that 3TSR
but not Lexatumumab induces endothelial cell apoptosis (Fig. 1C).
Combination treatment in HCT116 xenograft mice also showed
an enhanced tumor inhibition (Fig. 1D). In these mice, treatment
with Lexatumumab alone or 3TSR alone and the combination
started to show evidence of tumor inhibition 2 weeks after
treatment (Fig. 1D). After the fourth week of treatment, the
Lexatumumab or 3TSR group showed significant tumor inhibition

compared with the control group, and the combination group
showed increased tumor inhibition compared with the Lexatumumab or 3TSR group. When treatment continued, the increased
tumor inhibition became significantly stronger in the combination
group, and by day 41, the tumor inhibition in the combination
group reached 68%, whereas Lexatumumab and 3TSR groups
displayed 46% and 36% inhibition, respectively. Statistical analysis
showed that combination treatment had significantly enhanced
tumor inhibition compared with the 3TSR or Lexatumumab group
(P < 0.05).
The notable cooperativity of Lexatumumab and 3TSR in tumor
inhibition suggests that this combination therapy could be
efficacious in a clinical setting.
3TSR induces apoptosis in microvascular endothelial cells
in a CD36-dependent manner. We next determined whether
3TSR could induce apoptosis in HDMEC by exposing these cells to
increasing concentrations of 3TSR. HDMEC were treated with
various concentrations of 3TSR for 24 h. Flow cytometry of the
sub-G1 apoptotic population of 3TSR-treated cells showed that
3TSR could induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A).
After 24 h of treatment with 0.2 Amol/L 3TSR, f23% of cells were
apoptotic, whereas 5 Amol/L 3TSR induced up to 42% apoptosis.
Under the same conditions, control cells treated with 3TSR buffer
and cells that were grown with 20% serum under normal growth
conditions showed 10% basal apoptosis, whereas TSP-1 (30 nmol/L)
and camptothecin (0.5 mg/mL) treatment caused 30% and 40%
apoptosis, respectively (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the HDMEC that were
treated with 3TSR (2 Amol/L) for 24 h showed a more detached and
rounded morphology (Fig. 2B) when compared with the untreated
controls and were positive for TUNEL staining (Fig. 2B).
It is known that 3TSR interacts with multiple membrane
receptors at the cell surface including CD36 to mediate the

apoptotic response of TSP-1 (4, 37, 38). We sought to determine
whether the 3TSR-induced apoptosis in HDMEC was also mediated
through CD36. HDMEC were preincubated with 30 mg/mL CD36blocking (FA6-152) antibody followed by treatment with 3TSR
(2 Amol/L) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2C, monoclonal antibody FA6152 attenuated 3TSR-induced apoptosis in HDMEC to close to the
basal level, indicating that CD36 is required for the apoptotic
activity of 3TSR in these cells.
3TSR induces apoptosis of HDMEC through activation of
caspase-8 and caspase-3. TSP-1–induced apoptosis of endothelial
cells has been shown to involve the activation of the apical
caspase-8/extrinsic pathway (27). To determine whether 3TSR
could also induce apoptosis through the activation of the caspase
cascade, we treated HDMEC with recombinant 3TSR (2 Amol/L) for
24 h and harvested cell lysates for Western blot analysis and
caspase activity assays. Figure 3A shows that cleaved caspase-8 can
be detected following treatment with 3TSR. In addition, we
observed that 3TSR induces a 3-fold increase in the activity of
caspase-8 compared with the control cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Furthermore, 3TSR-induced caspase-8 activity was inhibited by
IETD inhibitor (Fig. 3A).
To determine if the principal downstream executioner caspase-3
is also activated, HDMEC cultures were treated with 3TSR (2 Amol/
L) for 24 h. Cell lysates were then prepared and the processed
caspase-3 signature fragment was detected by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 3A). Additionally, in caspase-3 activity assays, we
observed a 5- to 6-fold increase in the activity of caspase-3
compared with control cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). This activity
was inhibited by caspase-3–specific inhibitor DEVD (Fig. 3A).
3TSR activates the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic
pathways in HDMEC. To determine the involvement of the
mitochondrial pathway in mediating 3TSR-induced apoptosis, we

the proapoptotic death receptors DR4
and DR5. A, 3TSR treatment of HDMEC
for 1 to 12 h significantly increased
expression of DR4 and DR5 at the
transcriptional level. B and C, 3TSR
treatment of HDMEC for 1 to 12 h
increased both DR4 and DR5 protein
expression, whereas 3TSR treatment of
HDMEC for 8 h increased both
DR4 and DR5 expression in a
concentration-dependent manner.
D, pretreatment of HDMEC cells with
DR4- and/or DR5-blocking antibody for
30 min inhibited 3TSR-mediated
apoptosis.

evaluated the release of cytochrome c and the activation of
caspase-9. HDMEC were treated with buffer control or 3TSR
(2 Amol/L) for 24 h. Cell lysates were then prepared and
fractionated into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Western
blot analysis was done for cytochrome c, HSP-60 (mitochondrial
protein), h-actin, and GRB2 (39), a protein that is normally
excluded from mitochondria. Figure 3B shows that whereas the
majority of cytochrome c is in the mitochondrial fraction in control
cells, treatment of HDMEC with 3TSR resulted in the release of
cytochrome c into the cytosol. Moreover, the 3TSR-induced release
of cytochrome c from the mitochondria also corresponded with
the appearance of processed fragments of caspase-9 and a 7-fold
increase in the activity of caspase-9 (Fig. 3A; Supplementary
Fig. S2). Additionally, stimulation of HDMEC with hTSP-1 resulted

in the activation of caspase-9. Finally, the caspase-9-specific
inhibitor LEHD prevented the 3TSR-induced activation of caspase-9 (Fig. 3A).
To further show that 3TSR-induced apoptosis is dependent on
the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, we used
specific inhibitors of each of these caspases. The caspase-8-specific
inhibitor z-IETD-fmk and the caspase-9-specific inhibitor z-LEHDfmk both partially inhibited the apoptosis induced by 3TSR
(2 Amol/L). Interestingly, a combination of these inhibitors resulted
in a complete attenuation of 3TSR-mediated apoptosis in HDMEC
(Fig. 3C). Similarly, the inhibition of the executioner caspase-3
by z-DEVD resulted in a complete inhibition of 3TSR-mediated
apoptosis (Fig. 3C). These observations suggest that the activities
of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 are required for mediating

Figure 5. 3TSR-induced DR4 and DR5 expression is mediated by JNK activation. A, 3TSR and IgG treatment of HDMEC for 4 h up-regulated DR4 and DR5
expression and this increase was suppressed with the CD36-blocking antibody FA6-152. B, both 3TSR-stimulated phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK and JNK activity in
HDMEC were inhibited by treatment with SP600125, a selective inhibitor of JNK and FA6-152. C, 3TSR treatment of HDMEC for 4 h up-regulated DR4 and DR5
expression. Treatment of these cells with SP600125, however, similarly decreased DR4 and DR5 levels. D, 3TSR sensitizes HDMEC to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
HDMEC were treated with control buffer, 3TSR, and TRAIL alone or in combination. 3TSR and TRAIL combination enhances apoptosis induced in HDMEC. Inhibition of
caspase activity by z-VAD suppresses this cooperation. Additionally, combination of 3TSR and TRAIL enhances caspase-8 activity in HDMEC. Processing of
caspase-8 was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Arrow, processed p43/p41 signature fragments of caspase-8 processing. Jurkat cells are used as a control to show
the activity of TRAIL.

A Double Hit to Kill Tumor and Endothelial Cells

Figure 6. VEGF induces Akt activation in HDMEC and 3TSR inhibits basal
and VEGF-induced Akt activation of HDMEC. A, HDMEC were treated with
control buffer, 3TSR (2 Amol/L), VEGF (100 ng/mL), or a combination of
3TSR and VEGF for the indicated times. B, exogenous expression of Myr-Akt
inhibits 3TSR-induced apoptosis in HDMEC. Fluorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis indicated that exogenous expression of myr-Akt inhibited
3TSR-mediated apoptosis in microvascular endothelial cells. C, 3TSR acts as a
double-edged sword promoting apoptosis via up-regulation of DR4 and DR5
and inhibiting cell survival via attenuation of the Akt pathway.

3TSR-induced apoptosis and their independent activation results
in a cooperative effect to promote the induction of apoptosis.
3TSR-induced apoptosis is mediated by JNK activation and
induction of DR4 and DR5 expression. Whereas 3TSR-induced
activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways is
involved in mediating the subsequent apoptosis, the molecular
mechanism for interaction and/or cross-talk between 3TSR and
death receptor pathways is not well characterized. Low levels of
VEGF have been shown previously to induce Fas ligand expression,
targeting endothelial cells for TSP-1-induced apoptosis (27). Here,
we investigated whether 3TSR can modulate the expression of
Fas, TRAIL, and/or TRAIL receptors. Treatment of HDMEC with

www.aacrjournals.org

1 Amol/L 3TSR does not significantly alter Fas or Fas ligand mRNA
expression as measured by real-time PCR analysis (data not
shown). However, 1 Amol/L 3TSR resulted in a transient increase in
DR4 and DR5 mRNA expression (2-fold increase in DR4 mRNA
after 4 h, f2-fold increase in DR5 after 1 h, and f3-fold increase
after 4 h 3TSR treatment, respectively; Fig. 4A). Additionally,
Western blot analysis showed a time- and dose-dependent increase
in DR4 and DR5 protein levels (Fig. 4B and C). Notably, 3TSRinduced apoptosis in HDMEC was dependent on the activity of
DR4 and DR5 receptors, as DR4- and DR5-blocking antibodies
attenuated it (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 5A, a 3TSR-induced
increase in DR4 and DR5 is attenuated by CD36-blocking antibody
(FA6-152), indicating the involvement of CD36 in this pathway.
TSP-1 has been shown to regulate the activity of JNK (4), which
modulates the expressions of several death receptors including
DR5 (13). Therefore, we investigated whether the 3TSR-induced
increases in DR4 and DR5 expression are mediated by the JNK
pathway. As a basis for these studies, we first confirmed that
treatment of HDMEC with 3TSR does result in a transient
activation of JNK (Fig. 5B). Following 30 min treatment with
1 Amol/L 3TSR, we observed a 1.75-fold increase in the level of
JNK phosphorylation in HDMEC. Additionally, cotreatment of
HDMEC with 1 Amol/L 3TSR and 10 Amol/L JNK inhibitor
(SP600125) or 10 Amol/L CD36-blocking antibody (FA6-152)
inhibited 3TSR-induced JNK phosphorylation, indicating that
3TSR-induced JNK activation is dependent on the interaction
between 3TSR and CD36 (Fig. 5B). Finally, to investigate the effect
of JNK activation on 3TSR-induced DR4 and DR5 expression,
HDMEC were treated with 3TSR (1 Amol/L) alone or in
combination with SP600125 (10 Amol/L) for 4 h. As shown in
Fig. 5C, inhibition of JNK activity resulted in a significant reduction
in the level of 3TSR-induced DR4 and DR5 protein expression.
Similarly, 3TSR results in activation of p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, inhibition of
p38 with SB203580 does not ablate the 3TSR-induced expression of
DR5 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
HDMEC are generally highly resistant to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 5D). The 3TSR-induced increase in the levels of
the TRAIL receptors, DR4 and DR5, in HDMEC suggests that
these cells may become sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. As
shown in Fig. 5D, treatment of HDMEC with TRAIL (10 ng/mL) for
18 h does not result in any significant increase in the rate of
apoptosis. However, pretreatment of HDMEC with 3TSR (1 Amol/L)
for 6 h followed by 18 h treatment with TRAIL (10 ng/mL) resulted
in close to 30% apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 5D). In support of
this cooperation between 3TSR and TRAIL, we also observed a
synergistic effect in the activation of caspase-8 by 3TSR and TRAIL.
Whereas treatment of HDMEC with TRAIL (10 ng/mL) for 18 h or
with 3TSR (1 Amol/L) for 6 h did not result in any significant
processing of caspase-8 (Fig. 5D), pretreatment of HDMEC with
3TSR for 6 h followed by treatment with TRAIL (10 ng/mL) for
18 h did result in processing of caspase-8 as is evident from the
appearance of the signature p43/p41 fragments (Fig. 5D).
3TSR inhibits VEGF-stimulated survival and promotes
down-regulation of c-Akt activity. A delicate balance of negative
and positive signals regulates angiogenesis in normal and
pathologic conditions. VEGF is a positive regulator of angiogenesis
and protects them from apoptosis (40–42). The survival activity of
VEGF and other growth factors is thought to promote resistance of
endothelial cells to apoptosis (43–45). Recently, it has been shown
that the protein kinase c-Akt functions as a critical part of the

survival signaling pathway downstream of VEGF (44, 46). Therefore,
we investigated whether 3TSR could suppress survival of
endothelial cells through suppression of the VEGF-induced
activation of c-Akt. To test this hypothesis, HDMEC were
preincubated with 3TSR (2 Amol/L for 8 h) followed by 15 or
30 min treatment with 100 ng/mL VEGF (Fig. 6A). We observed
that 3TSR reduced the basal level of c-Akt phosphorylation and
also significantly inhibited the VEGF-induced phosphorylation
of c-Akt.
To further corroborate these observations, HDMEC were
transfected with a constitutively active mutant of Akt (Myr-Akt).
Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were either treated
with 1 Amol/L 3TSR for 24 h to analyze the level of apoptosis in
these cells (Fig. 6B) or lysed to verify the expression of myr-Akt
(data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6B, Myr-Akt protects HDMEC
from 3TSR-induced apoptosis.

Discussion
Here, we report that Lexatumumab and 3TSR cooperate in
inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. This cooperative action highlights
the importance of targeting tumors and their microenvironment
for an efficacious therapeutic strategy. Additionally, we report that
the mechanism by which 3TSR promotes apoptosis of endothelial
cells is through the JNK-dependent induction of DR4 and DR5
expression. This up-regulation of DR4 and DR5 subsequently leads
to the activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways,
culminating in the activation of a cascade of executioner caspases
including caspase-3. These studies establish that the death
receptors are integrally involved in the mechanism by which
3TSR promotes apoptosis. As TRAIL and TRAIL receptors have
been shown previously to play a key physiologic role in the immune
response against tumor cells, here we show that TRAIL receptors
can also be involved in regulating the angiogenic response in
endothelial cells. More importantly, we show that whereas HDMEC
are highly resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, 3TSR and TRAIL
synergistically cooperate to induce apoptosis of these cells. Thus,
the 3TSR-induced increase in DR4 and DR5 sensitizes these cells to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
The induction of DR4 and DR5 receptors by 3TSR on endothelial
cells suggests that the cooperative action of 3TSR and Lexatumumab could be due to Lexatumumab-induced apoptosis of both the
tumor and tumor-associated endothelial cells. It is likely that future
clinical trials may reveal that Lexatumumab combined with 3TSR
can indeed be more beneficial in humans, as it may be able to

induce apoptosis of 3TSR-primed endothelial cells. However,
reagents for investigating the direct effect of TRAIL (TRAIL or
TRAIL receptor agonist antibodies directed against mouse cells) on
tumor-associated endothelial cells are not currently available. We
are currently investigating the molecular mechanism for cooperative action of Lexatumumab and 3TSR. One possible mechanism
for this cooperative action is that 3TSR, through its apoptotic and
antiangiogenic effects, can induce hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment, which could sensitize these tumors to the action of
Lexatumumab (47).
The intrinsic apoptotic pathway can be triggered by death
receptors as well as by a variety of stress conditions including
chemotherapeutic agents, leading to the induction of mitochondrial perturbation and the release of cytochrome c. Our results
indicate that the mitochondrial pathway activation is necessary for
3TSR-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells. As mitochondria are
potent integrators/coordinators of apoptotic signaling pathways
(5, 48), the induction of the intrinsic pathway by TSP-1 and 3TSR
may play a critical role in determining the fate of endothelial cells
as well as determining their response to death receptor antibody
therapy and chemotherapy.
In summary, we show that 3TSR sensitizes endothelial cells by
up-regulating death receptor expression and down-regulating
survival signaling, leading to an enhanced antiangiogenic effect
(Fig. 6C). Furthermore, these studies suggest that therapeutic
approaches that use a combination of 3TSR and TRAIL may prove
to be more efficacious in cancer therapy than 3TSR or TRAIL alone
by providing a double hit, targeting both tumor and tumorassociated endothelial compartments.
