ABSTRACT
Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is an integral component of the cell cycle as well
as the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway. Previous work has demonstrated the
effectiveness of inhibiting CHK1 with small-molecule inhibitors, but the role of CHK1
mediated DDR in medulloblastoma is unknown. CHK1, both at the mRNA and protein
level, is highly expressed in medulloblastoma and elevated CHK1 expression in Group3
medulloblastoma is an adverse prognostic marker. CHK1 inhibition with the smallmolecule drug AZD7762, results in decreased cell growth, increased DNA damage and
cell apoptosis. Furthermore, AZD7762 acts in synergy with cisplatin in reducing cell
proliferation in medulloblastoma. Similar phenotypic changes were observed with
another CHK1 inhibitor, PF477736, as well as genetic knockdown using siRNA against
CHK1. Treatments with small-molecule inhibitors of CHK1 profoundly modulated
the expression of both upstream and downstream target proteins within the CHK1
signaling pathways. This suggests the presence of a feedback loop in activating CHK1.
Overall, our results demonstrate that small-molecule inhibition of CHK1 in combination
with, cisplatin, is more advantageous than either treatment alone, especially for Group
3 medulloblastoma, and therefore this combined therapeutic approach serves as an
avenue for further investigation.

have been associated with medulloblastoma cell biology,
novel therapeutic interventions based on this knowledge
have seen limited development [5, 6]. Current mainstay
medulloblastoma therapies (surgical resection, craniospinal
irradiation, and chemotherapy) have yielded reduced
mortality in average-risk patients, however in high-risk
patient outcomes remain suboptimal [7, 8]. As chemotherapy
and craniospinal radiation both have significant long-term
irreversible side effects, there is clear indication for the
development of a novel medulloblastoma treatment [9–13].

INTRODUCTION
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant
brain tumor of childhood [1]. Recent genomic investigation
has identified four subgroups of medulloblastoma with
variable clinical outcomes, illustrating genetic heterogeneity
of medulloblastoma and emphasizing the need for
new therapeutic interventions based on the molecular
signatures of these subgroups [2–4]. Although various
signaling pathways (such as Sonic Hedgehog and Wnt)

RESULTS

Protein kinases play a key role in cell cycle
regulation and proliferation making them an ideal
target for cancer therapy. In order to explore new
kinase targets, we utilized transcriptional profiling for
medulloblastoma samples, as well as a kinome-wide
siRNA screen, identifying eight kinases that play central
roles in tumor cell viability [14]. Three of these kinases
(Aurora Kinase A, Polo-Like Kinase A, and WEE1) have
been demonstrated to exhibit therapeutic value in data
presented previously by ourselves and others [14–18].
Additional analysis of our previous data, along with the
aforementioned microarray and siRNA screen results,
indicate Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHK1) as a differentiallyexpressed potential therapeutic target in medulloblastoma.
To ensure cellular survival, it is paramount that
cells have the ability to regulate homeostasis and
prevent neoplastic conversion. In order to maintain
cellular viability, there exists a complex series of critical
surveillance and repair mechanisms. One such mechanism
is known as the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway
which, in response to DNA damage, rapidly induces
cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair mechanisms, and
– if necessary – apoptosis, via recruitment of the ATM/
ATR kinase pathway. Upon activation of ATM/ATR the
downstream target CHK1 (a serine-threonine kinase
responsible for the regulation of the G2/M cell cycle
checkpoint) becomes phosphorylated and transiently
halts the cell cycle progression to allow for DNA damage
repair [19–24]. Although cell cycle arrest and DNA repair
mechanisms protect integrity of normal cells, it may also
diminish the effectiveness of cancer therapy by facilitating
resistance in tumor cells. Furthermore, a majority of the
tumors are deficient in the G1 DNA damage checkpoint
pathway and other components of checkpoint signaling,
making them solely reliant on the G2/M checkpoint for
DNA repair [19, 21]. Thus, abrogation of G2/M checkpoint
via the inhibition of CHK1 activity could provide an
optimal therapeutic route to selectively sensitize tumor
cells to chemotherapy and remove subsequent resistance
mechanisms. Recently, studies combining CHK1
inhibitors with a cytotoxic agent have shown promising
results in adult and pediatric solid tumors, however, the
role of inhibiting CHK1 in the context of medulloblastoma
is not well characterized [22, 25].
Reported herein, we sought to evaluate the role of
CHK1 as a potential therapeutic target in medulloblastoma.
We first confirmed differential expression of CHK1 in
samples from two independent medulloblastoma patient
cohorts. Next, we examined the effects of inhibiting
CHK1 activity in terms of tumor cell viability, cell colony
formation, and relative apoptosis. Finally, we examined
the impact of inhibiting CHK1 in combination with
the standard-of-care therapeutic compound cisplatin in
medulloblastoma cells in vitro using the small molecule
inhibitor AZD7762.

CHK1 is overexpressed in medulloblastoma
Through genomic analysis, we recently
demonstrated that multiple kinases regulating the G2/M cell
cycle check point are key mediators of medulloblastoma
cell viability. Among the kinases we identified was
CHK1. We hypothesized that a kinase regulator of DNA
damage during the cell cycle would be an ideal candidate
as a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma. To test our
hypothesis, we analyzed CHK1 mRNA expression in
a cohort of 16 medulloblastoma patient samples. We
found the expression of CHK1 mRNA was high in all
patient samples when compared to normal cerebellum
(Figure 1A). Analyses have defined four major subgroups
of medulloblastoma which are Sonic Hedgehog Signaling
(SHH), Wnt signaling (WNT), Group 3 (MYC-amplified),
and Group 4 [2]. To further elucidate whether there was a
correlation within the subgroups of medulloblastoma, we
examined expression of CHK1 mRNA in second cohort
(n=120) of medulloblastoma patient samples. When
examined at the genomic subgroup level, there was no
difference in CHK1 mRNA expression among genomic
subgroups but all four groups showed increased levels of
CHK1 compared to normal cerebellum. (Figure 1B). It
is possible that CHK1 expression is decreased in normal
cerebellum due to decreased numbers of proliferating
cells. To address this we compared CHK1 levels in murine
P5 cerebella to group 3 medulloblastoma cell lines. We
found that CHK 1 expression is significantly higher in
proliferating tumor cell lines compared to proliferating
normal cerebellum (Supplementary Figure S1) These
data indicate that CHK1 mRNA up-regulation may not
be specific to a molecular subgroup of medulloblastoma.
We further evaluated the expression of CHK1 mRNA in
a panel of well-characterized medulloblastoma cell lines.
All medulloblastoma cell lines expressed significantly
higher levels of CHK1 when compared to pediatric normal
cerebellum, which was consistent with our patient tissue
sample data (Figure 1C). We next examined CHK1 protein
expression in normal pediatric cerebellum as well as a
panel of medulloblastoma cell lines. Compared to normal
pediatric cerebellum, CHK1 protein expression was
increased in all medulloblastoma cell lines (Figure 1D).
We next decided to examine the impact of CHK1
expression on patient survival. Gene expression and
survival data from 204 patients (Pomeroy data set) was
evaluated using R2 microarray analysis and visualization
platform (http://r2.amc.nl). High CHK1 expression is
associated with adverse outcomes in medulloblastoma
over all (Figure 2A). Subgroup analysis shows that CHK1
expression is particularly predictive of poor outcome in
Group 3 tumors (Figure 2B, p < 0.01) but not SHH or
Group 4 tumors (Supplementary Figure S2).

potently suppresses medulloblastoma cell growth
in vitro

assay. AZD7762 was a potent inhibitor of Daoy cell
growth with IC50 of 20 nM (Figure 3A).
To further characterize chemical inhibition of CHK1
we examined the impact on viability of 2 well characterized
medulloblastoma cell lines that carry Myc translocations and
are part of the Group 3 genomic sub-group. Cell viability
was assessed following AZD7762 drug treatment using
Guava EasyCyte Plus flow cytometer. D283 and D425
cells were treated with 40nM AZD7762 for 72 hours. After
treatment, cell viability decreased with 40 nM AZD7762 in
both D283 and D425 cell lines (Figure 3B).

Several CHK1 inhibitors have been recently
described as potentially possessing therapeutic utility [24].
AZD7762, a thiophene carboxamide urea, is one of these
inhibitors [26]. We examined the effect of CHK1 inhibition
using AZD7762 on proliferation of medulloblastoma cells.
Daoy cells were treated with varyious concentrations of
AZD7762 and cell proliferation was measured by MTS

To evaluate the impact of AZD7762 on longterm proliferation, we performed colony formation and
methylcellulose assays on Daoy and D283 cell lines,
respectively. In Daoy tumor cells, 72-hour exposure
to 20 nM and 40 nM AZD7762 significantly decreased
colony number (Figure 3C, p < 0.0005). Similarly,
AZD7762 treatment significantly suppressed the ability
to form colonies in D283 cells (Figure 3D, p < 0.05) in
methylcellulose. These data reflect the impact of CHK1
inhibition on cell viability of medulloblastoma cells.
In order to assess whether AZD7762 was inhibiting
CHK1 activity, we measured the protein expression levels
of phosphorylated CHK1 by immunoblotting. A decrease
in levels of phosphorylated-CHK1 was seen in a dosedependent manner with a range of AZD7762 treatment in
Daoy and D283 cell lines (Figure 3E). The levels of CHK1
showed no significant change with varying concentration
of AZD7762 treatment as anticipated.

Daoy and D283 cell lines when treated for 72 hours with
40 nM and 20 nM of AZD7762, respectively (Figure 4A).
Quantitative analysis of the data showed DNA damage
was significant when compared to DMSO control for both
Daoy (p < 0.01) and D283 (p < 0.05) cell lines (Figure 4B).
To examine more closely the impact of CHK1
inhibition on DDR proteins we evaluated levels of
phosphorylated ATR and ATM and phosphorylated CHK1
in medulloblastoma cells. When medulloblastoma cells,
Daoy treated with varying concentrations of AZD7762,
there is a decrease in pCHK1, pATM and no significant
changes in pATR (Figure 4E). Similarly when these cells
were treated with another CHK1 inhibitor, PF477736,
there is a drastic decrease in pATR, pATM and pCHK1
(Figure 4F). Like wise there is a significant induction of
phosphorylation of pH2AX and pRPA32 suggestive of
induction of DNA damage (Figure 4F). We also evaluated
phosphorylation of associated proteins CHK2 and
p53. AZD7762 did not alter phosphorylation of CHK2
but PF477736 did decrease CHK2 phosphorylation
indicating a less specific mechanism for this drug. Both
compounds induced phosphorylation of p53 as expected
(Supplementary Figure S3).

Treatment with AZD7762 induces DNA damage
DNA damage repair pathways play a critical role
in survival of tumor cells, especially following treatment
with DNA damaging agents. γH2AX is recruited to sites
of DNA damage and is removed after DNA repair. To
assess the impact of AZD7762 on medulloblastoma cells,
we analyzed DNA damage following treatment with
AZD7762 by staining with an anti-γH2AX flourophore
antibody and subsequently measured via flow cytometry.
Results analyzed using flow cytometric software reflected
increased DNA damage as measured by γH2AX foci in

AZD7762 acts in synergy with cisplatin

calculated by the AUC of confluence over the 72-hour
period. In comparison to DMSO, a significant increase
in apoptosis was observed in Daoy cells treated with
16 nM and 250 nM AZD7762 drug for 72 hours which
was visualized (Figure 5A) and quantified (Figure 5B).
Furthermore, increase in cellular apoptosis correlated
directly with increasing concentration of AZD7762
(Supplementary Figure S4).

Most chemotherapy protocols for medulloblastoma
involve cisplatin. Cisplatin use has significant adverse
effects including ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and
severe bone marrow suppression. Thus, drugs that
work synergistically will allow reduction in the dose of
standard chemotherapeutic agents. We examined the

ability of AZD7762 to act in synergy with cisplatin using
an MTS assay. Based on the optical densities measured,
combination-index values were calculated in Daoy cell
lines using the CIE method as described in the methods
section. Combination index values showed synergy in
reducing cellular proliferation of Daoy cells between
AZD7762 and cisplatin at varying concentrations below
the IC50 value of AZD7762 (Figure 6A).

To further assess the long-term impact of combination
therapy on medulloblastoma cells, we used the colony
formation assay. Daoy cells were exposed to AZD7762,
cisplatin, or combination of both for 72 hours and colony
formation was assessed as described in methods section.
Compared to AZD7762 or cisplatin alone, Daoy cell line had
significantly lower number (p < 0.01) of colonies formed in
combination treatment group. (Figure 6B). Representative
colony wells with and without treatment were shown.

To confirm whether genetic knockdown of CHK1
leads to similar phenotypic changes observed with smallmolecule drugs, AZD7762 and PF477736, we performed
an siCHK1 transfection in Daoy cells.

We sought to investigate if the results presented
above were a product of AZD7762 treatment specifically
or a result of CHK1 inhibition. To do this we first treated
Daoy, D283, and D458 medulloblastoma cells with an
alternative small-molecule CHK1 inhibitor, PF477736
[27]. Similar to AZD7762, we found a decrease in cellular

CHK1 knockdown was confirmed via qRTPCR (Figure 7D) and was shown to decrease cellular
proliferation (Figure 7E) and clonogenic assay in Daoy
cells (Figure 7F). Taken together, these results suggest that
our findings are not an anomaly of AZD7762 treatment
and are in fact a product of CHK1 inhibition; thus further
validating the use of CHK1 as a therapeutic target for
medulloblastoma patients.

[34]. Most importantly, our analysis revealed that
elevated expression of CHK1 correlated with poor
long-term survival in patients with Group 3 subgroup
medulloblastoma. Group 3 tend to be more aggressive
in comparison to other subgroups [2, 4]. These results
in combination with the lack of differences in CHK1
expression amongst medulloblastoma subgroups suggests
that CHK1 upregulation may play a direct role in overall
survival of patients with medulloblastoma and thus makes
it a critical target for clinical trials.
Liu Q et al., showed that CHK1 is regulated by
two upstream PIK family kinases ATM and ATR and
that plays an important role in the G2/M DNA damage
checkpoints and tumor suppression [35]. ATR and ATM
are activated within minutes of DNA damage and increase
the phosphorylation of CHK1. This in turn can work
in a feedback loop mechanism and save the cells from
cell death. Our data in medulloblastoma confirm these
previous studies and further suggest that these drugs can
be a promising therapeutic addition in medulloblastoma.
For example it has been shown that CHK1 is crucial for
the proliferation of T-ALL cells by preventing ATM/
Caspase-3 dependent cell death [36]. Sarmento et al,
reported that in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
ATM/ATR activation dependent CHK1 phosphorylation is
involved in activating the replication stress response [36].
In agreement with these findings, we found by protein
analysis that inhibition of CHK1 by PF477736, increased
the levels of the replication stress mark pRPA32 and the
DNA damage marker γH2AX. This suggests replication
stress induced DNA damage leads to cell apoptosis when
CHK1 activity is inhibited. We then tested whether CHK1
inhibition can sensitize cells to other chemotherapeutic
agents when those agents induce DNA damage and can
lead to positive feedback in ATM/ATR pathway that
rescue cells from cell killing.
Chemotherapy forms a vital backbone of
medulloblastoma therapy. However, it results in
significant therapy related morbidity. CHK1 is activated
in response to DNA-damaging agents like chemotherapy
or radiation. Following DNA damage, activated CHK1
phosphorylates cdc25c which prevents downstream
activation of CDK1 resulting in cell cycle arrest at G2/M
checkpoint [21]. The G2/M cell cycle checkpoint is
critical to ensure genomic repair prior to mitosis. Thus,
abrogation of this checkpoint can lead to premature
mitotic entry and subsequent cell death [37, 38]. In this
study, we showed that low nanomolar concentrations of
AZD7762 sensitized medulloblastoma cells to cisplatin.
Combination index values further reflected synergy
between AZD7762 and cisplatin. Thus, our results suggest
that AZD7762 effectively enhanced chemo-sensitivity in
medulloblastoma cells in vitro.
In summary, our data reveals that CHK1 inhibition
has a critical role in medulloblastoma therapy in addition
to other cancers [39]. The next step will be to perform

DISCUSSION
Genomic heterogeneity of medulloblastoma has
created challenges in improving outcomes using traditional
approaches. In addition, significant therapy related
morbidity in patients with medulloblastoma has resulted
in an urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. Although
recent genomic studies have begun to characterize the
molecular signature of medulloblastoma subgroups
[2–4], the clinical progress in terms of designing novel
agents based on this knowledge has been limited. Recent
analysis of protein kinase gene expression has revealed
that multiple protein kinases including those involved
in cell cycle checkpoint regulation, such as CHK1, were
differentially expressed in medulloblastoma [14, 15, 17].
CHK1 is a serine-threonine kinase which plays a
critical role in DNA repair, mitotic spindle checkpoint,
and regulation of apoptosis [28–30]. Specifically, it is a
critical component of DNA damage response pathway
which ensures genomic stability. CHK1 expression is
elevated in many adult and pediatric cancers, including
triple-negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer,
and neuroblastoma [31]. While CHK1 mRNA expression
is elevated in medulloblastoma, its role in pathogenesis is
not completely understood.
In this study, we demonstrate that CHK1 mRNA
is overexpressed in two independent cohorts of
medulloblastoma patient samples in comparison to normal
cerebellum. We also showed that CHK1 upregulation
was not specific to any subgroups of medulloblastoma.
However CHK1 upregulation in Group 3 medulloblastoma
demonstrated a particularly poor prognosis, perhaps due
to its role in mitigating Myc driven replication stress.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of CHK1 by
small molecule inhibitors AZD7762 and PF477736 as well
as genetic knockdown of CHK1 in medulloblastoma cell
lines results in decreased proliferation both in short and
long-term assays. Treatment with 20nM AZD7762 also
induced DNA damage and apoptosis in medulloblastoma
cell lines. These results are similar to the effect of
AZD7762 in other cancers [32, 33].
There are several CHK1 inhibitors currently
undergoing clinical trials including SCH900776 and
LY2606368 in other types of cancer. However, there
are currently no clinical studies of CHK1 inhibitors
in medulloblastoma. Our data and those presented in
literature provide strong indication for such studies

Gene expression microarray analysis
Sixteen tumor samples from the first cohort were
collected at the time of surgery and snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Tumors were homogenized and RNeasy kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to extract ribonucleic
acid from tumor samples which was hybridized to HGU133 Plus 2.0 Gene-Chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)
to evaluate for gene expression. Microarray data from the
samples was background-corrected and normalized using
gcRMA algorithm. In subsequent analysis, one probe set
per gene was used which was based on highest overall
expression level across samples. Student’s t-test was used
to determine differential expression of genes [40].
Second cohort of 120 tumor specimens was
obtained in accordance with the Research Ethics Board

(EPR17343, Cat. No. 179477) was purchased through
Abcam, plc. (Cambridge, MA), and Actin (MAB1501)
was purchased from Millipore. All primaries diluted to a
1:1,000 concentration, with the exception of actin which
was diluted to 1:10,000, in 5% (w/v) milk in TBST,
phosphorylated-CHK2 which was diluted to 1:250, in 5%
BSA in TBST, phosphorylated-p53 which was diluted to
1:500, in 5% BSA in TBST, and p53 which was diluted
to 1:2,000, in 5% milk in TBST. Secondary antibodies
conjugated to horseradish-peroxidase were used in
conjunction with chemiluminescent reagent to visualize
protein bands.

used. Synergy between AZD7762 and cisplatin was
determined with MTS absorbance data using Chou-Talalay
Combination Index Theorem (CIE) [41].
Additionally, real-time measurement of cell
proliferation was performed using an xCelligence RTCA
SP instrument (Acea Biosciences, San Diego, CA)
housed in an incubator maintained at normal cell culture
parameters. A background sweep was initially acquired
before seeding cells and monitoring for 24 hours. At
24 hours, AZD7762 or PF477736 were overlayed onto
Daoy cells. Cellular proliferation was monitored for up
to 100-hours total run time. Daoy cells transfected with
siCHK1 or siNegative control were seeded onto 96-well
xCelligence plate, and real-time cell proliferation was
measured.
To determine cell viability, cells were seeded
for 24 hours prior to treatment with a range of CHK1
inhibitors, AZD7762 and PF477736, with concentrations
encompassing the IC50 for 72-hours. The viable cell
concentration was determined following staining with
Guava ViaCount reagent (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
Samples were run on a Guava EasyCyte Plus flow
cytometer (Millipore).

Colony formation and methylcellulose assay
In a 6-well plate, 500 cells were seeded in triplicate
for 24 hours. Following seeding, cells were treated with 20
nM AZD7762, 175 nM cisplatin, or combination of both
for 72 hours. At the end of treatment period, drug was
removed and cells were allowed to grow in normal culture
media. After seven days following seeding, culture media
was aspirated. Cells were washed with PBS and colonies
were stained with 0.5% crystal violet/25% methanol
solution. Colonies were imaged using a GelCount™
(Abingdon, United Kingdom) imager, and colonies
composed of ≥50 cells were counted.
For methylcellulose assay, D283 cell line
(medulloblastoma suspension cell line) was seeded at a
density of 1,000 cells per well in a 1.3 % methylcellulose
solution containing AZD7762 at variable concentration.
Following seeding, cells were allowed to form colonies
for a period of 10 days. At the end of incubation period,
colonies were counted using nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT)
(1mg/mL in 1X PBS) and counted using GelCount™
(Abingdon, United Kingdom). Relative colony numbers
were subsequently determined by normalizing colony counts
against the average vehicle treated control colony count.

Immunofluorescence by flow cytometry
Cells were seeded in triplicates in a 6-well plate
for 24 hours and treated with AZD7762 for a period of
72 hours. Following treatment, cells were washed with
PBS and incubated in BD Cytofix™ fixation buffer
(#554655) for 10 minutes. Samples were subsequently
re-washed with PBS before incubation with 1:10
dilution of anti-γH2AX (Ser139) conjugated antibody
in the dark for 1 hour. Cells were washed again with
PBS and incubated for 5 minutes using 0.1% Triton™
X-100 to permeabilize them. Antibodies were removed,
samples were washed in PBS and counter-stained using
1:1000 dilution of 7-AAD in PBS for 15 minutes prior
to acquisition on Guava EasyCyte Plus flow cytometer
(Millipore). Acquired data was analyzed using FlowJo
software (Ashland, Oregon).

Cell proliferation and viability assays
Cell proliferation was determined, in one
method, by MTS [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium]
assay using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution (Promega,
Madison, WI). Cells were seeded for 24 hours before
drug treatment. AZD7762 was added following seeding
for a 72 hours at which point 30 µL of MTS reagent was
added to the wells to make a final volume of 180 µL. The
optical densities of wells were recorded using BioTek
Synergy 2 plate reader (Winooski, VT) every hour for 3
hours after addition of the reagent. Background absorbance
was subtracted from all well before analysis and IC50
values for the drug were calculated from the corrected
absorbance values using GraphPad Prism. For combination
drug treatment, different concentrations of cisplatin were

Caspase 3/7 assay using IncuCyteZOOM
Cells were seeded at 1,500 cells per well in a 96well plate (Costar, Corning, NY). Cells were cultured at 37
°C and 5% CO2 and monitored using an IncuCyteZOOM
(Essen BioScience, Ann Arbor, MI). Images were
captured at 4-hour intervals from four separate regions
per well using a 10X objective. Apoptosis was detected
using CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent
(#C10423) purchased from Life Technologies (Grand
Island, New York). Each experiment was done in triplicate
and relative apoptosis were plotted by nuclear cell count
measurements.
