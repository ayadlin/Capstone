Abstract
Nicotine and its derivatives, by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) on bronchial epithelial cells, can
regulate cellular proliferation and apoptosis via activating the
Akt pathway. Delineation of nAChR subtypes in non–small-cell
lung cancers (NSCLC) may provide information for prevention
or therapeutic targeting. Expression of nAChR subunit genes
in 66 resected primary NSCLCs, 7 histologically non-involved
lung tissues, 13 NSCLC cell lines, and 6 human bronchial
epithelial cell lines (HBEC) was analyzed with quantitative
PCR and microarray analysis. Five nonmalignant HBECs were
exposed to nicotine in vitro to study the variation of nAChR
subunit gene expression with nicotine exposure and removal.
NSCLCs from nonsmokers showed higher expression of nAChR
A6 (P < 0.001) and B3 (P = 0.007) subunit genes than those
from smokers, adjusted for gender. In addition, nAChR A4
(P < 0.001) and B4 (P = 0.029) subunit gene expression showed
significant difference between NSCLCs and normal lung. Using
Affymetrix GeneChip U133 Sets, 65 differentially expressed
genes associated with NSCLC nonsmoking nAChR A6B3
phenotype were identified, which gave high sensitivity and
specificity of prediction. nAChR A1, A5, and A7 showed
significant reversible changes in expression levels in HBECs
upon nicotine exposure. We conclude that between NSCLCs
from smokers and nonsmokers, different nAChR subunit gene
expression patterns were found, and a 65-gene expression
signature was associated with nonsmoking nAChR A6B3
expression. Finally, nicotine exposure in HBECs resulted in
reversible differences in nAChR subunit gene expression.
These results further implicate nicotine in bronchial carcinogenesis and suggest targeting nAChRs for prevention and
therapy in lung cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4638–47]

Introduction
Tobacco smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, and nicotine
in tobacco smoke leads to both addiction and further metabolism
into potent carcinogen(s). In addition, recent discoveries of
functional acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on lung epithelial cells
and lung tumors raise the question of whether exposure to nicotine

could also participate in lung cancer pathogenesis by activating
signal transduction pathways such as the Akt pathway (1). One
model could be that nicotine by stimulating nicotinic AChRs
(nAChR) would activate Akt in lung epithelial cells and perhaps
stimulate cell proliferation and/or overcome apoptotic responses
engendered by carcinogen exposure (1). If this model is true, then
one may ask whether lung tumors have different nAChR expression
patterns compared with normal lung tissues and whether lung
cancers arising in smokers have different patterns compared with
never smokers. Such differences would provide additional information that nicotine is playing a role via the nAChRs in lung cancer
pathogenesis. In recent decades, there have been an increasing
proportion of female nonsmokers compared with male smokers in
patients with lung cancer (2). It is possible that both gender and
smoking, or an interaction of both factors, are playing roles in lung
carcinogenesis. Differences between men and women may also
make them respond to tobacco smoke in different ways, and lung
tumors derived from male smokers and female nonsmokers may
have adopted different carcinogenic pathways. Thus, it would be
important to analyze the role of nAChR expression in the context of
gender as well.
AChRs are divided into nicotinic (nAChR) and muscarinic
(mAChR) subtypes. nAChRs are further subdivided into neuronal or
muscle subtypes, which could also be present in nonneuronal or
non-muscle tissues. Neuronal nAChRs are composed of different
subunits including a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a9, a10, h1, h2, h3, or
h4. In addition to these different a and h subunits, the muscle type
nAChR may also contain y, q, and g subunits. Genes encoding for
individual nAChR subunit are named CHRNA1, CHRNA2, CHRNA3,
CHRNA4, CHRNA5, CHRNA6, CHRNA7, CHRNA9, and CHRNA10 for
the a subunits and CHRNB1, CHRNB2, CHRNB3, and CHRNB4 for
the h subunits. nAChRs are found to be present throughout the
central nervous system (CNS) and in nonneuronal tissues, such as
a3, a5, and a7 in bronchial epithelium (3, 4); a4 in alveolar
epithelial cells (4); and a3, a5, a7, h2, and h4 in pulmonary
neuroendocrine cells and human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell
lines (5–8), skin keratinocytes (9), vascular tissues (10), and human
lymphocytes (11). nAChR holoreceptor is a pentamer consisting of
five homologous or different nAChR subunits surrounding a ligandgated channel (12) that responds to binding by ligands such as
acetylcholine, nicotine, or its highly carcinogenic derivative
4(methylnitrosamine)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK; ref. 13). Neuronal nAChR consists of only two types of subunits: either a
combination of a and h subunits or five copies of the same a
subunits (14). Both the a and h subunits are thought to contribute
to the physiologic properties of nAChR, where a subunit contains

the principal sites for agonist binding, such as acetylcholine, and h
subunits are believed to regulate the rate of binding and
dissociation by agonists (15). Functional receptors in the brain
are composed mainly of a4h2, a4a5h2, a6h2h3, a6h3, a4a6h2h3,
and a7 (16, 17). In fact, a4h2 in the brain is thought to be
responsible for nicotine addiction (18, 19). a6 associated with h2
and h3, a3 or a4 is present in dopaminergic and adrenergic
neurons in the brain (20); and a6h3, in particular, is a functional
nAChR (21). Receptor affinity for nicotine varies with different
composition of nAChR subunits (20). Transfection studies have
shown that the ratio of a/h subunits in nAChRs depends on the
ratio of expression of the encoding nAChR subunit genes (22).
nAChRs were first implicated in the growth regulation of lung
cancer when nicotine was found to stimulate DNA synthesis in
human SCLC cell lines (23), and this was supported by subsequent
identification that the receptor involved was nAChR a7 (7, 24). We
have previously shown that lung cancer cells expressed nAChR , and
that nicotine, at concentrations found in smokers, blocked the
induction of apoptosis in lung cancer cells (25); whereas West et al.
showed that activation of nAChR resulted in downstream
activation of the Akt pathway (1), protein kinase C pathway, and
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, leading to
inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of growth and proliferation
in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC; refs. 1, 25).
In the brain, nAChR a7 showed paradoxical up-regulation in
response to chronic exposure to nicotine, whereas other nAChR
subunits were down-regulated. It has also been shown that the
nAChR a7 in the lungs of monkeys is up-regulated by exposure to
nicotine (26). Up-regulation of functional nAChR a7 subunits has
been shown in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE)
upon exposure to nicotine (10). In SCLC cell lines, up-regulation of
nAChR a7 has been shown in response to NNK stimulation, with
overexpression and phosphorylation of serine-threonine protein
kinase Raf-1 and extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 and
activation of c-myc (27), leading to increased proliferation (1, 28).
There is also speculation that chronic tobacco smoking may induce
a positive feedback loop that amplifies nicotine response in NHBE
cells (10, 29). On the other hand, tolerance to the adverse effects of
nicotine could reflect desensitization of nAChR. Thus, it would be
important to know if other nAChR subunit genes respond to
nicotine exposure in a similar way, and these nicotine stimulation
responses may give insight into their potential roles in nicotine
addiction or bronchial carcinogenesis.
Recent reports of clinical trials of the nAChR a4h2 antagonist,
which target a4h2 receptors in the brain, have shown its clinical
efficacy in smoking cessation (30). It is possible that similar
nAChR antagonists could block the effect on lung epithelial cells
or tumor cells.
All of these observations led to our current study of the
quantitative mRNA expression analysis of various nAChR subunit
genes in lung cancers, normal lung, and lung epithelial cells and
their variation with the smoking history of the patients. In fact, we
found significant differences in nAChR receptor subunit expression
patterns in comparisons of tumor and normal tissue and also
differences between lung adenocarcinomas, depending on smoking
(nicotine) exposure.

Materials and Methods
Clinical characteristics of tumor and cell line samples. Total RNA
was extracted from frozen tissue of 66 surgically resected non-SCLC

(NSCLC) specimens and 14 normal lungs tissues. NSCLC tumor specimens
were collected from Hong Kong Chinese patients undergoing surgical
resection. Normal lung tissues used in this study were collected from
patients with lung cancer undergoing surgical resection, and specimens
were reviewed to show no tumor involvement. Written informed consent
for tumor and normal lung tissues collection were obtained from patients
recruited before surgery, and ethics approval for study protocol was
obtained from the local Institutional Review Board of the University of
Hong Kong (HKU)/Hong Kong Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster.
The demographic characteristics of these lung cancer patients, including
their age, gender, smoking habits, and tumor-node-metastasis pathologic
staging information, are summarized in Table 1. Nonsmokers were patients
who have never smoked for their lifetime. Smokers included patients who
have been current active chronic smokers before surgery and patients who
have been daily smoking for more than 6 months in the past but have quit
smoking at the time of surgery. All 66 NSCLC tumors collected were
included in quantitative PCR, and 49 (all primary lung adenocarcinomas) of
these 66 specimens were used for microarray studies; in addition, of the 14
normal lung tissue specimens, 9 were used for microarray analysis, whereas
7 of them were included in quantitative PCR analysis (two normal lung
tissue specimens were used in both microarray analysis and quantitative
PCR analysis).
A panel of 13 NSCLC cell lines (9 NCI-H lung cancer cell lines and 4
HKULC lung cancer cell lines) were used in this study, and total RNA was
extracted for quantitative PCR (Table 1). The NCI-H lung cancer cell lines
(all were NSCLC lines: H1437, H1648, H1770, H1819, H1993, H2009, H2087,
H2122, and H2347) were maintained at the Hamon Center for Therapeutic
Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at
Dallas (31) and have been deposited in the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) repository (32). The HKULC cell lines (HKULC1–4) were
newly established lung adenocarcinomas from Hong Kong Chinese
patients (33) being maintained and stored at the University of Hong
Kong, HKSAR, China. The demographic characteristics of patients from
whom the cell lines were established, including their gender, smoking
habits, and tumor cell types, were known. The normal bronchial epithelial
cell lines included in this study were one cell line derived from peripheral
alveolar space, the small airway epithelial cell (Clonetics), and other
bronchial epithelial cell lines, including NHBE (Clonetics), BEAS-2B (ATCC
CRL-9609), and five NHBE cell lines of the HBEC-KT series (Dr. John
Minna’s Laboratory; ref. 34).
Complementary DNA synthesis. Total RNA was extracted from tissue
specimens and cell lines. RNA samples (1 Ag) were reverse transcribed in
20 AL reaction mix [5 First-Strand Buffer (Invitrogen), 100 mmol/L DTT
(Promega), 1 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphate (Amersham Biosciences), oligo-dT12-18 primers (Invitrogen) and random hexamer (Promega),
RNaseOUT Recombinant RNase Inhibitor (Invitrogen), and Superscript II
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen)] with 1-h reaction at 42jC.
Quantitative PCR reactions. Twelve pairs of primers spanning across
intron-exon junctions were designed for quantitative PCR targeting nAChR
subunit genes a1, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a9, a10, h2, h3, and h4 (Table 2), with
18S as the reference gene. Reaction conditions were validated separately for
each pair of primers, with single peak of dissociation curves produced in
each run of reaction.
Quantitative PCR reactions were carried out in triplicates. SYBR Green I
(SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix, Sigma) was used as the detection
dye, and ribosomal 18S was used as the reference gene. Final reaction
volume was 10 AL, with 1.25 AL of one-tenth TE-diluted cDNA from reverse
transcription reaction, 0.1 Amol/L of each specific primer, and 5 AL SYBR
Green Jumpstart Taq ReadyMix. Quantitative PCR cycles were set at 10-min
denaturation followed by 40 cycles of 95jC for 15 s, 60jC for 5 s, and 72jC
for 20 s and 72jC for 10 min as the final extension step. Dissociation curves
were inspected for each pair of primers, and only one dissociation peak
must be present for each run of reaction before the results were considered
to be valid. A 5-fold serial dilution of a reference sample was used for
construction of standard curves with respect to each pair of primers.
Quantitative PCR was run for each tumor or cell line cDNA sample, and the
C t for a particular sample was obtained from the standard curves for a

the C t of reference samples to obtain the normalized relative amount for
unknown samples. The normalized relative amount was then log 2
transformed, and approximation to normal distribution was estimated.
Excel RGB (red-green-blue color coding macro) coding was done with a
black-blue-white scale representing highest to lowest level of nAChR gene
expression detected in this study for expression pattern inspection. For
quantitative PCR data, the normalized relative amount for all samples was
multiplied by a common factor of 1,024 and then log 2 transformed to give

RNA was checked with denaturing formamide gel electrophoresis, which
showed two sharp and distinct bands of 18S and 28S. Quality check was also
done by the Agilent Bioanalyzer with graphical analysis showing two
distinct peaks of 18S and 28S without additional peaks of degradation. The
total RNA was then hybridized onto Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133 A and B
sets according to standard protocols (35).
Absolute signals from an individual chip were captured and processed
with the MicroArray Suite 5.0 software (Affymetrix). Captured signals were
further scaled and normalized to median expression level with an in-house
Visual Basic software ‘‘MATRIX’’ (Microarray Transformation in Excel)
version 1.31 written by Luc Girard at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center at Dallas. The MATRIX program allowed input of multiple
CHP files from MicroArray Suite 5.0 into an Excel spreadsheet where
normalization, t tests, and color display were done and further statistical
analysis could be done with raw, normalized, and transformed probeset
signal intensities for each sample in Excel spreadsheet format.
The BRB ArrayTool 3.4.0 program (developed by Amy Peng Lam and
Richard Simon at the Biometric Research Branch, National Cancer Institute)
was used for significance analysis of microarray (SAM) to analyze for
differentially expressed genes between different group phenotypes and for
class prediction to identify signature genes that predict group phenotypes
by computer algorithm such as support vector machine (SVM). All lung
cancer samples were designated as either having a higher than the mean
level of expression or a lower than the mean level of expression for
individual subunit gene. Comparisons using SAM were made between
samples above and below their respective mean levels of expression for
individual nAChR subunit genes a1, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a9, a10, h2, h3, and
h4 or different combinations of the expression levels of these nAChR
subunit genes.
Response to nicotine exposure in NHBE cell lines. Five NHBE cell
lines (HBEC-KT 1–5; ref. 34) were cultured, and an equal number of
passages for each cell line were randomized into a nicotine group and
control group. The HBECs were seeded and incubated for 24 h before
addition of nicotine. At time 0 h, nicotine (100 nmol/L) was added to the
nicotine group, and the same volume of culture medium without nicotine
was added to the control group. Both groups were incubated for 72 h, after
which medium from both groups was removed and replaced with the same
volume of fresh medium without nicotine. Both groups were further
incubated for 72 h until time 144 h was reached. Cells were harvested at
time 0, 72, and 144 h. Total RNA was extracted for reverse transcription and
quantitative PCR as described above.
Statistical analysis. Microarray analysis was done by the in-house
program MATRIX 1.31, an Excel-based visual basic program written for
analysis of microarray data. Student’s t tests, with assumptions of two tails
and unequal variance, were used for comparison of expression level of
different subunit genes between groups of samples with different gender
and smoking history. m2 tests were used for comparing the distribution of
smokers and nonsmokers with high or low mean expression of individual or
combinations of nAChR subunit genes. SAM and class prediction with SVM

expression when NSCLC tumors, normal lung tissues, NSCLC cell
lines, and NHBE cell lines were compared (Fig. 1C). When resected
NSCLC were compared with normal lung tissues, there were
statistically significant differences in the expression levels of
CHRNA4 (mean NSCLC/mean normal lung = 3.10/6.32, P < 0.001)
and B4 (mean NSCLC/mean normal lung = 7.56/5.96, P = 0.029).
A subgroup analysis with separate comparisons between the
squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma against normal lung
tissue was done. For the comparison between squamous
cell carcinoma (n = 6) and normal lung tissues (n = 7), no
statistically significant difference in the expression levels of any
nAChR subunit gene was observed. When adenocarcinomas
(n = 54) were compared with normal lung tissues (n = 7), significant
differences were found in the expression of nAChR a4 (mean
adenocarcinoma/mean normal lung = 1.92/6.32, P < 0.001) and b4
(mean adenocarcinoma/mean normal lung = 7.56/5.96, P = 0.029).
However, CHRNA4 and CHRNB4 did not show statistically
significant difference when NSCLC cell lines were compared with
HBEC lines. Instead, the expression levels of CHRNA5 (mean NSCLC
cell lines/mean HBECs = 6.83/5.00, P = 0.022), CHRNA7 (mean
NSCLC cell lines/mean HBECs = 6.20/ 0.05, P = 0.023), CHRNA9
(mean NSCLC cell lines/mean HBECs = 2.33/ 1.46, P = 0.001),
and CHRNB2 (mean NSCLC cell lines/mean HBECs = 1.84/ 1.78,
P = 0.037) were found to be significantly higher in NSCLC cell lines
compared with NHBE cell lines.
Significant differences for the expression levels of the CHRNA6
(mean smokers/mean nonsmokers = 4.41/6.81, P < 0.001) and
CHRNB3 (mean smokers/mean nonsmokers = 6.51/7.16, P = 0.007)
subunit genes (Fig. 2A and B) were found when primary lung
adenocarcinomas arising in smokers versus nonsmokers were

compared. This difference remained after adjusting for gender ( for
men: CHRNA6, P = 0.003; CHRNB3, P = 0.031 and for women:
CHRNA6, P = 0.001; CHRNB3, P = 0.027; Fig. 2C and D). Among the
samples with low nAChR a6h3 expression level, 8 of 34 (23.5%)
were smokers, and 3 of 24 (8.8%) were nonsmokers; and among the
samples with high nAChR a6h3 expression levels, 3 of 24 (8.8%)
were smokers, and 20 of 34 (58.8%) were nonsmokers. The
proportion of smokers and nonsmokers among samples with low
or high nAChR a6h3 gene expression was significantly different
(m2 distribution, P < 0.001).
Expression analysis with Affymetrix GeneChips. No significant differential gene expression from the Affymetrix arrays was
found that identified tumor groups with high or low expression by
quantitative PCR for individual nAChR subunit genes a1, a3, a4,
a5, a6, a7, a9, a10, h2, h3, and h4 as well as for combinations of
low a4 and high h4, or with low a4 and low h2. However, with
combined nAChR a6h3 expression levels, 173 genes were found to
be differentially expressed between 34 samples with nAChR a6h3
low (n = 11) compared with samples with nAChR a6h3 high
(n = 23), when the false discovery rate was controlled at 0.05 (i.e.,
allowed 5% chance of false discovery among the list of significant
differentially expressed genes identified). Class prediction with
leave-one-out analysis and SVM was done using these 173 genes.
Repetitive training and testing with division of samples into
training set (random two third) and test set (random one third)
resulted in 65 signature genes (Table 3) predictive of the ‘‘nAChR
a6h3 phenotype’’ with 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity. When
these 65 genes were used for prediction of all the 49 samples, the
prediction sensitivity and specificity were 87% and 61%, respectively, for smoking habits.

Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in Lung Cancer

Exposure of NHBE cell lines to nicotine. We wished to know if
brief exposure to nicotine would alter the expression level of any of
the nAChR subunit genes in bronchial epithelial tissue. We took
advantage of our new immortalized HBEC to study this. When
HBEC lines were exposed to 100 nmol/L nicotine and then RNA
was harvested at 72 and 144 h, a significant increase in the
expression levels of CHRNA1, CHRNA5, and CHRNA7 were found at
72 h, with return to baseline levels of expression upon nicotine
removal (Fig. 3). No significant increase or decrease was found in
the levels of expression of other nAChR subunit genes analyzed.

Discussion
The distribution, function, and ligand-binding affinity of nAChR
depends on the composition of nAChR subunits, although the exact
function and physiologic roles of individual nAChR subtypes and
its subunits are not completely understood. To our knowledge, the
pattern of expression of these nAChR subunits has not been
reported in NSCLC. The quantitative PCR analysis of nAChR

nAChR subunit genes in NHBE cell lines. HBEC(1-5)-KT, human bronchial

subunit gene expression levels allowed for quantitative comparison
between groups of samples with respect to gender and smoking
habits. We have shown overall statistically significant differences in
the expression levels of CHRNA4 and CHRNB4 between NSCLC
tumor and normal lung tissues as well as CHRNA6 and CHRNB3
between NSCLC tumors from smokers and nonsmokers (Fig. 2) and
CHRNA1 and CHRNA7 with respect to gender. The expression
levels of CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 were statistically different even
after adjusting for the effect of gender.
CHRNA4 is the major nAChR subtype found throughout the CNS
and was thought to be responsible for nicotine addiction (19). The
expression level of CHRNA4 was found to be significantly lower in
NSCLC tumor compared with normal lung tissues. A modest
elevation of CHRNB4 subunit gene expression in NSCLC compared
with normal lung tissues was detected in this study. Such
differences in the levels of expression of CHRNA4 and CHRNB4
were not found when comparing NSCLC cell lines or NHBE cells.
There have been previous reports of functional polymorphism of
nAChR a4h4 leading to variable nicotine-induced transmembrane
conductance in vitro (36). The relatively lower level of CHRNA4
expression in NSCLC tumor might imply that CHRNA4 expression
was down-regulated in the process of lung carcinogenesis. One
possible mechanism for this to happen could be desensitization of
nAChR subunit gene expression on chronic exposure to stimulation
by its agonists such as nicotine. The differences in the levels of
expression of CHRNA4 and CHRNB4 subunit genes might imply
that they were involved in the process of lung carcinogenesis, but
the potential mechanism deserve further evaluation.
The NSCLC cell lines showed other nAChR subunit gene
expression differences when compared with NHBE cell lines (i.e.,
CHRNA5, CHRNA7, CHRNA9, and CHRNB2). The nAChR a5 subunit
has been reported to be present in the brain and usually coassembled with a3, a4, h2, or h4 to form various nAChR subtypes
such as a4a5h2 and a3a5h4 (16). The presence of a5 subunit in
nAChR has been shown to alter the calcium permeability and
nicotine sensitivity in vitro (37). The nAChR a7 subunit was found
to be important in the control of nicotine-induced calcium influx in
SCLC (38) and was thus thought to be important in growth signal
transduction induced by nicotine binding to nAChR. nAChR a9 was
present mainly in inner ear hair cells and has been found to form
nAChR with a10 subunits (39), but its function has not been fully
characterized. nAChR h2 formed the nAChR a4h2 subtype that was
thought to mediate nicotine addiction in the brain (20, 22). The fact
that CHRNA5, CHRNA7, CHRNA9, and CHRNB2 subunit genes
showed elevated levels of expression in NSCLC cell lines could
indicate their involvement in constitutive cellular processes in
cancer cell lines.
CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 showed differences in expression level
between NSCLCs from smokers (relatively lower expression levels)
and nonsmokers (relatively higher expression levels), even after
adjustment for the effect of gender. The pattern of CHRNA6 and
CHRNB3 gene expression in our study of NSCLCs is similar to the
observations that CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 are coexpressed in the
CNS (16), and they form functional nAChR in the brain (21). In fact,
CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 were located closely on chromosome
8 (8p11.21 and 8p11.2, respectively), and it was possible that they
share a common regulatory mechanism. The fact that both
CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 subunit genes showed lower expression in
NSCLCs from smokers when compared with nonsmokers could
imply desensitization with chronic exposure to tobacco smoke. In
NSCLC cell lines, no significant difference in the expression of

nAChR subunit genes was found between cell lines derived from
smokers and cell lines derived from nonsmokers. This could be
attributed to the small number of NSCLC cell lines (n = 13) being
studied, or that the effects of tobacco smoking on nAChR gene
expression had ceased with in vitro culture.
A list of 65 differentially expressed genes was found to be
predictors of nAChR a6h3 phenotypes, whereas no significant
differentially expressed genes were found between samples with
different levels of expression of individual nAChR subunit genes or
combinations, including a4h4, a4h2, a6h2, etc. Some of these genes
are involved in the regulation of apoptosis (p8; ref. 40), potential
tumor suppressor genes in lung cancer [CEBPA (41) and NME1
(42)], or in other cancers [NDRG2 (43) and MXI1 (44)] and genes
involved in tumor progression and metastasis [DPP4 (45), PLUNC
(46), and SFRP4 (47)]. Both EGFR and MYC were found to be on the
list of differentially expressed genes with respect to the a6h3
phenotypes. Binding of nAChR by nicotine was thought to activate
downstream signaling pathway via Akt phosphorylation (1). It has
been reported that nAChR may trigger the MAPK pathway with
which EGFR and MYC were involved (reference: KEGG pathway
hsa04010: classic MAPK pathway), eventually leading to promotion
of cell growth and proliferation. EGFR expression was higher in the
high a6h3 tumors. Inhibitors of EGFR prevented nicotine-induced
Akt phosphorylation in mouse pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12;
ref. 48). Thus, cross-talk between signaling downstream of EGFR
and nAChR activation via the AKT and MAPK pathways may
together promote carcinogenesis in this group of tumors (48). On
the other hand, the low a6h3 tumors showed high MYC and low
CEBPA expression. MYC overexpression had been found to lead to
reduction in CEPBA-mediated cytochrome activation in the
presence of EGF stimulation in proliferating cells (49). Together,
the data suggest involvement of distinctive pathways mediated by
EGFR or MYC in tumors that express different combination
patterns of A6 and B3 nAChR subunits. Further investigation into
their relation with nicotine exposure and verification with
functional studies would be warranted.
There were gender differences detected in the expression level of
CHRNA7 in lung cancer cell lines. CHRNA7 had been most well
studied in patients with schizophrenia (50). There were suggestions
of CHRNA7 correlating with gender and nicotine dependence in
patients with schizophrenia (51). CHRNA7 has been reported to be
expressed in SCLC cell lines (5, 6). There was previous reports of
sensitization of the nAChR a7 subunit in human SCLC cell lines by
elevated carbon dioxide level at the expense of oxygen level (52). It
was thus proposed that chronic pulmonary condition such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may promote the
growth of SCLC. This was further supported by demonstration of
up-regulation of the nAChR a7 subunit of endothelial cells by
second-hand smoke and hypoxia (53). In addition, the growth of
pulmonary neuroendocrine cells was shown to be under the
control of the nAChR a7 subunit (27), with formation of multiple

hyperplastic foci indicative of increased proliferative activity in the
lungs of smokers with COPD and other chronic pulmonary diseases
(54). It was possible that, in addition to smoking status or nicotine
exposure, the presence of nonneoplastic pulmonary disease that
impairs lung oxygenation may influence the expression of CHRNA7.
CHRNA1, CHRNA5, and CHRNA7 showed significant reversible
induction of expression on in vitro exposure to nicotine, providing
direct evidence that these subunit genes respond to acute nicotine
exposure and could mediate the immediate or short term effects of
nicotine. Little is known about the functional significance of the
expression these specific CHRNA1, CHRNA5, and CHRNA7 in the
CNS or in lung cancer, although CHRNA7 had been reported to be
expressed in SCLC cell lines (5) and was thought to be related to
smoking in schizophrenic patients (50), as discussed above. Upregulation of functional CHRNA7 has also been shown in NHBE cells
on exposure to nicotine (10). The return of the expression levels of
those three subunits to baseline upon cessation of nicotine exposure
may reflect that continued or chronic exposure to nicotine (usually
taken to be more than 10 days of continuous exposure to nicotine;
ref. 55) was required for nicotine addiction or other cellular effects of
nicotine mediated by specific nAChR subunits. The effects of chronic
exposure to nicotine on nAChR subunit gene expression in these
NHBE cells and whether the same response is maintained, or other
nAChR subunit genes would be involved, in chronic nicotine
exposure warrant further evaluation. As the baseline expression
level of CHRNA6 and CHRNB3 are low, we cannot determine whether
they are down-regulated on nicotine stimulation.
In summary, we have determined the pattern of expression of
CHRN subunit genes in NSCLCs, normal lung, normal bronchial
epithelial cells, and tumor cell lines. The combination of CHRNA6
and CHRNB3 high expression correlated with NSCLCs in nonsmokers, whereas the combination of low expression correlated
with NSCLCs from smokers. This leads to the identification of
differential gene expression with class predictive significance. With
short-term exposure to nicotine, there were elevated level of
expression for CHRNA1, CHRNA5, and CHRNA7 subunit genes.
These nAChR subunit genes could be playing a role in the
pathogenesis of bronchogenic carcinoma and may mediate the
effects of nicotine addiction in lung cancer patients of different
sexes. Further evaluation of the functions and roles played by these
nAChR subunit genes in nicotine addiction and lung carcinogenesis
are warranted to allow for opportunities in development of
chemoprevention strategy.
