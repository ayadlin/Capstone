Abstract
Beyond cancer-cell intrinsic factors, the immune status of the host has a prognostic impact on patients with
cancer and inﬂuences the effects of conventional chemotherapies. Metastatic melanoma is intrinsically
immunogenic, thereby facilitating the search for immune biomarkers of clinical responses to cytotoxic agents.
Here, we show that a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, upregulates interleukin (IL)-15Ra in vitro and in
vivo in patients with melanoma, and in conjunction with natural killer (NK) group 2D (NKG2D) ligands,
contributes to the Th1 polarization and accumulation of peripheral CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells. Hence, the increase of
blood CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells after two cycles of sorafenib (combined with temozolomide) was associated with
prolonged survival in a prospective phase I/II trial enrolling 63 patients with metastatic melanoma who did not
receive vemurafenib nor immune checkpoint–blocking antibodies. In contrast, in metastatic melanoma patients
treated with classical treatment modalities, this CD4þNKG2Dþ subset failed to correlate with prognosis. These
ﬁndings indicate that sorafenib may be used as an "adjuvant" molecule capable of inducing or restoring IL-15Ra/
IL-15 in tumors expressing MHC class I–related chain A/B (MICA/B) and on circulating monocytes of responding
patients, hereby contributing to the bioactivity of NKG2Dþ Th1 cells. Cancer Res; 74(1); 68–80. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Therapy for metastatic melanoma remained unsatisfactory
for many decades. A range of various treatment modalities
based on chemotherapy has had little impact on survival (1). As
a single agent, dacarbazine (DTIC) has been commonly used
(2). Some investigators substitute DTIC with temozolomide

(related oral alkylating agent) for its convenience of administration and its central nervous system penetration. A phase III
trial comparing an extended schedule of temozolomide with a
standard dose of single-agent DTIC failed, however, to show
any statistical differences in terms of response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS; refs. 3, 4). Temozolomide produces response rates of 4.13% and a median
progression-free survival of 1.9 months in patients without
brain metastases. More recently, advances in understanding
the genetic changes associated with melanoma development
identiﬁed activating mutations in the serine/threonine kinases
BRAF (5), establishing mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways as new drug targets in melanoma. Sorafenib, a
multikinase inhibitor of VEGF receptor (VEGFR), KIT, platelet—derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and RAF proteins as well as several proangiogenic tyrosine kinases, was
tested in phase II trials alone or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel and seemed to be promising on response
rates and median progression-free survival, but was associated
with toxicity (6). Unfortunately, subsequent phase III trials of
the combination of sorafenib and paclitaxel/carboplatin only
demonstrated beneﬁt in patients with metastatic melanoma in
ﬁrst and second line of therapy (7, 8). Next, even before the era
of more speciﬁc BRAF inhibitors, Amaravadi and colleagues
conducted a phase II trial combining temozolomide with
sorafenib in advanced melanoma, showing relative safety and
activity in patients without prior history of temozolomide (9).

Sorafenib Regulates IL-15Ra and NKG2D Ligands

In parallel, attempts to harness antitumor immunity have
progressively led to therapeutic success in melanoma (10).
Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies alone or together with peptide-based
vaccination or with DTIC signiﬁcantly prolonged survival of
stage III/IV melanoma in two phase III trials (10, 11). One
surmises that in patients responding to immunotherapy,
tumor- and/or vaccine-speciﬁc T cells reset local tumor microenvironment and convert immune tolerance into immunerelated tumor destruction (12).
Because vaccines showed some unexpected efﬁcacy after
tumor progression with cytotoxic compounds (13, 14), a new
concept emerged whereby the host immune system could
contribute to the beneﬁcial effects of cytotoxic compounds
(15). Indeed, the outcome of chemotherapy can be inﬂuenced
by the host immune system at multiple levels. Chemotherapy
can kill cancer cells in a way that they elicit an immune
response (16) or, alternatively, increase their susceptibility to
immune attack (17). In addition, chemotherapy can stimulate
anticancer immune effectors either directly (by activating
effector or dendritic cells) or indirectly by subverting immunosuppressive mechanisms (18, 19). Hence, a recent report
pointed out that patients with metastatic melanoma responding to DTIC exhibit a stromal and immune signature, deﬁned by
hallmarks of T-cell inﬁltration and MHC class II expression (20).
A number of immune effectors, including dendritic cells, T
cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, have been involved in natural
or therapy-induced tumor immunosurveillance in mice (21,
22). The NK group 2D (NKG2D), a lectin-like activating receptor, markedly inﬂuences IFN-g release and cytotoxic responses
upon tumor recognition, exerting selective pressure on transformed cells (23). A large body of preclinical work highlighted
the beneﬁcial role of the activating receptor NKG2D in immunosurveillance against cancer (24, 25). In most instances,
NKG2D-induced effects are mediated through NK or CD8þ
effector T cells. Here, we unveil the immunomodulatory role of
a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, on a rare subset of
circulating (and intratumoral) CD4þCD8dimNKG2Dþ T cells
prone to secrete Th1 cytokines upon cotriggering of CD122 (IL2/IL-15Rb chain) and NKG2D receptors. Indeed, sorafenib
induced the upregulation of interleukin (IL)-15Ra expression
on tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, and/or on circulating
monocytes in metastatic melanoma (cotreated with temozolomide) in a phase I/II prospective trial. In all patients with
metastatic melanoma, melanoma expressed high intrinsic
levels of MHC class I–related chain A/B (MICA/B) molecules.
Patients developing enhanced frequencies of CD4þNKG2Dþ T
cells after two cycles of sorafenib exhibited prolonged survival.
Of note, such CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells failed to dictate the
prognosis in another cohort of metastatic melanoma enrolled
in a MAGE3 protein (26) underscoring the immunoregulatory
role of sorafenib.

was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Kremlin Bic^etre (Paris, France) and Institut Gustave
Roussy (Villejuif, France). All patients provided informed consent before enrollment. The treatment plan is outlined in
Supplementary Fig. S1. Stage III and IV melanoma-bearing
patients were enrolled from 2006 to 2009 in a dose-escalating
phase I followed by a phase II extension cohort at the maximum-tolerated dose trial testing the efﬁcacy of the combinatorial regimen of temozolomide (Schering Plough; 100–150
mg/m2 daily for 7 days every 2 weeks) and sorafenib (Bayer;
400–800 mg twice daily without interruption). Therapy was
continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
Response assessments consisted of physical examination every
4 weeks together with computed tomography scans of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 8 weeks. Patients were
assessed by an investigator using the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines 1.1. Responses
were conﬁrmed by follow-up radiographic evaluation 4 weeks
after the initial response criteria were met. BRAF mutations
were determined according to technical methods previously
described (9). The primary endpoint of the trial was the efﬁcacy
of the treatment at 3 months. Patients were classiﬁed as
objective response or stabilization (called "responders" henceforth) versus progressive disease or death (PD; called "nonresponders" henceforth).
MAGE3 protein–based vaccines. The details about
patient characteristics, protocol description, and survival have
been previously reported by Kruit and colleagues (26). CD4þ
NKG2Dþ T cells were analyzed at in the beginning before
vaccine inoculation (1 month after relapse with conventional
therapies) and correlated with OS.
NY-ESO-1 vaccine trial. Prevaccine peripheral blood samples were collected from patients with malignant melanoma,
sarcoma, breast, and ovarian cancer enrolled in a clinical trial
of vaccination with recombinant NY-ESO-1, Montanide ISA 51,
and CpG 7909 (27) upon informed consent and approval by the
Institutional Review Board of Columbia University Medical
Center (New York, NY).
Immunohistochemistry studies
Parafﬁn-embedded tumor tissues were ﬁrst rehydrated and
then treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; DAKO) for neutralizing endogenous peroxidase and Serum Free Protein Block
(DAKO) to prevent nonspeciﬁc binding. After blocking, primary antibody, anti-MICA/B (SR99; a kind gift from Sophie
Caillat-Zucman, INSERM, U1016, Saint Vincent de Paul Hospital, Paris, France) was applied. Binding speciﬁcity was controlled by immunoglobulin G (IgG)1-isotype controls (RnD).
For visualization, EnVision anti-mouse (DAKO) horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated streptavidin was applied, followed by
the chromogen 3,30 -diaminobenzidine/H2O2 (DAB; DAKO).
Immunostained sections were counterstained very brieﬂy with
Mayer's Hemalaun, dehydrated, and cleared with xylene, before
covered with mounting medium (toluene-based) and coverslips (DAKO). For staining of anti-CD3 (polyclonal rabbit, 1:150;
DAKO), anti-CD4 (1:20; Novocastra), and anti-CD8 (1:25; Novocastra), the Benchmark system was used. For detection of IL15Ra, primary antibody (AF247; R&D Systems) was applied at

70

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

10 mg/mL after blocking, and anti-goat IgG Alexa Fluor 568 was
used at 5 mg/mL as secondary antibody. Isotype-matched
antibody was used as negative controls. Samples were
mounted in ProLong Gold antifade with 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) reagent (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent
images were analyzed with an epiﬂuorescent microscope
(Zeiss Apotome Microscope).
PBMC preparations
Blood samples were drawn from 63 patients before and after
each treatment cycle and from 12 healthy volunteers. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were resuspended in culture
medium, i.e., RPMI-1640 (GIBCO Invitrogen), 10% human ABþ
serum (Jacques Boy), 1% penicillin/streptavidin (PEST; GIBCO
Invitrogen), and 1% 2 mmol/L glutamine (GIBCO Invitrogen).
Some cells were then stained for ﬂow-cytometric analyses and
the rest were resuspended in CryoMaxx medium (PAA Laboratories) for storage in liquid nitrogen.
Tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes preparations
Resected lymph node specimens and/or metastatic tissue
from 16 patients with metastatic melanoma were analyzed for
inﬁltrating lymphocytes. Tissue samples were placed in dissociation medium, i.e., RPMI-1640, 1% PEST, collagenase IV
(8,000 UI/mL), hyaluronidase (112,000 IU/mL), and DNAse
(12,700 IU/mL), and run on a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). The cell samples were then diluted in RPMI1640 þ 10% human ABþ serum, passed through a cell strainer,
and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 300  g. Next, the cells were
resuspended in PBS and stained for ﬂow-cytometric analyses.
Tumor-coupled specimens of noninvaded lymph node or
blood samples were obtained from 10 patients and were
analyzed as above.
Flow cytometry
Cells were stained with ﬂuorochrome-coupled monoclonal
antibodies (mAb), incubated for 20 minutes at 4 C, and
washed. Adherent cells were treated with trypsine (Gibco)
before the staining step. Cell samples were analyzed using a
CyAn ADP 9-Color ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) or an
LSRII ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For proper compensation, single-stained antibody-capturing beads were used
(CompBeads; BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using
FlowJo (TreeStar, Inc.) or FACSDiva (BD Biosciences). For
accurate determination of nondiscrete populations, ﬂuorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls were used. For dead-cell
discrimination, DAPI (Invitrogen) or the ﬁxable amine-reactive
LIVE/DEAD Cell-Stain Kit (Invitrogen) was used. For phenotypic analysis of CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells, PBMC samples from 11
patients were thawed and resuspended in PBS for 9-color ﬂowcytometry staining. T cells of interest were identiﬁed by CD3,
CD4, CD56, CD8, CD14, and NKG2D mAbs and costained with
CD28 and CD45RA, or 2B4 and CD161, or IL-15Ra and CX3CR1,
or CD25 and CD158 antibodies. The following ﬂuorochromecoupled anti-human mAbs were used: anti-CD3 (Miltenyi
Biotec, BD, Beckman Coulter), anti-CD4 (BD), anti-CD8 (BD,
eBioscience), anti-CD14 (BD, eBioscience), anti-CD56 (Beckman Coulter), anti-NKG2D (Miltenyi Biotec), anti-Foxp3

Sorafenib Regulates IL-15Ra and NKG2D Ligands

(eBioscience), anti-CD25 (BD), anti-CD28 (BD), anti-CD45RA
(BD, eBioscience), anti-2B4 (BD), anti-CD161 (Beckman Coulter), CD158a (BD), anti-CX3CR1 (MBL), and anti-Ki67 (BD).
Rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-15Ra IgG antibody was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Puriﬁed anti-CD3 (OKT3), antiNKG2D (AF750), and goat anti-rabbit IgG-allophycocyanin
(APC) were purchased from BioLegend.
T-cell puriﬁcation and functional assays
Frozen PBMC samples were quickly thawed, washed, and
resuspended in recommended medium (RoboSep Buffer; STEMCELL Technologies) for magnetic bead separation with the
EasySep Human CD4-Positive Selection kit (STEMCELL Technologies). Positive-selection kit was chosen to avoid depleting
CD8þ CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells. For isolation of CD4þNKG2Dþ T
cells and NKG2Dþ NK cells, previously frozen PBMCs were
stained with mAbs to CD3, CD4, CD56, CD14, and NKG2D and
sorted by ﬂow cytometry on a three-laser MoFlo XDP cell sorter
(Beckman Coulter), or a three-laser ARIA III cell sorter (BD).
More than 98% pure populations of CD3þ/CD4þ/NKG2Dþ/
CD56/CD14 and CD56þ/NKG2Dþ/CD3/CD4/CD14 cells
were obtained.
Cytokine production. PBMCs from patients with metastatic melanoma were thawed and resuspended in culture
medium, and kept at 37 C, overnight. The next day, cells were
enriched for CD4þ T cells and seeded at 106 cells/mL on a ﬂatbottomed Nunc MaxiSorp 96-well plate, precoated with or
without anti-CD3 antibody (0.5 mg/mL), anti-CD122 antibody
(1, 10 mg/mL), and anti-NKG2D antibody (4 mg/mL) alone or in
combination. After 20 hours of cell culture, the supernatant
was collected, cleared by centrifugation, and analyzed by ELISA
for quantiﬁcation of IFN-g (BD), IL-2 (BD), TNF-a (BD), IL-17
(R&D Systems), and IL-10 (BD) according to the instruction
manuals. For cytokine-release from puriﬁed cells, ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted CD4þNKG2Dþ T
cells and NK cells were cultured overnight in the presence or
absence of soluble MIC (sMICA; 5 ng/mL; a kind gift from
Sophie Caillat-Zucman) and recombinant IL-15 (rhIL-15;
5 ng/mL; R&D Systems) alone or in combination. Release of
IFN-g into the supernatant was then measured by ELISA
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Proliferation. After precoating UV-sterilized MaxiSorp
Nunc plates with or without anti-CD3 antibody (1 mg/mL),
we plated CD4þ T cells in the presence or absence of sMICA
(5 ng/mL) and IL-15 (5 ng/mL) alone or in combination. Cells
were then cultured for 5 days, and then harvested for staining
with the phycoerythrin (PE)-coupled Ki67, as well as other
surface mAbs.
Cytotoxicity. PBMCs were cultured in RPMI/10%SAB with
or without 20 ng/mL IL-15 for 4 days. One day before coculture,
MEL10 target cells were stained with CMTMR (Invitrogen),
seeded on a round-bottomed plate (10,000 cells/well), and
treated with or without sorafenib (10 mmol/L). The next day,
PBMCs were collected and enriched for CD4 cells before
FACSAria III-sorting of NKG2D-positive/negative cells. Target
cells were washed with PBS before adding 40,000 sorted T cells
to each well and cultured for 20 hours. Floating cells were then
transferred to FACS tubes and adherent cells were trypsinized

www.aacrjournals.org

and collected into the same tubes. After centrifugation, the
cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed on a FACSCanto
II (BD). For cell death determination, To-Pro-3 (Invitrogen)
was added to the tube just before running.
Exposure of melanoma cells to cytotoxic compounds
Eight human melanoma cell lines, M14, M96, MELP, MEL8,
MEL397, MEL888, MT10, and MZ2 were plated and grown
conﬂuent in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM)
medium (GIBCO Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS
(PAA Laboratories), and 1% PEST. Cells were then cultured
in the presence or absence of sorafenib (5 mmol/L, Nexavar;
Bayer) and temozolomide (50 mmol/L, Temodal; Schering
Plough) alone or in combination (protocol without cell death,
not shown). The next day, cells were collected and labeled with
IL-15Ra polyclonal antibody (H107) followed by an APC-coupled secondary antibody and then stained with DAPI for deadcell exclusion for ﬂow cytometry analysis. FMO tube was added
as negative control, and background staining was excluded
with a goat anti-rabbit IgG-APC.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR for IL-15Ra
isoforms
Total cellular RNA was isolated from melanoma cells with
the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized
from 1 mg of total RNA using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) and random primers according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) for IL-15Ra (Hs00542604_m1,
Hs01986843_m1, and Hs00233692_m1) isoforms and for b2microglobulin was performed by real-time ﬂuorescence measurement using StepOnePlus System (Life Technologies). The
qRT-PCR data were adjusted to b2-microglobulin measurements using the 2DCT method (28).
Microarray
Global gene expression analysis was performed on 20 cDNA
samples from biopsies of patients with melanoma prior and post
two cycles of sorafenib/temozolomide, using the Human Gene
Expression 8  60 K Agilent Human Microarray Kit. Functional
analysis was carried out through the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(Ingenuity System).
Statistical analyses
Differences between groups of quantitative data were
assessed by Mann–Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank
test for all distributions, or Student paired or unpaired t test if
the criteria for Gaussian distribution was met. All reported P
values were two-sided, and a P value of less than 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Sorafenib Regulates IL-15Ra and NKG2D Ligands

at 3 months (CRþPRþSD called hereafter "responders") and 37
progressive disease being referred to as "nonresponders"
according to the RECIST criteria (Table 1). Severe lymphopenia
was observed in both responders and nonresponders (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).
We phenotyped circulating lymphocytes in a longitudinal
study over 2 months in 63 patients included in this phase I/II
trial. All patients with metastatic melanoma showed a significant reduction of NKG2D expression in both CD8þ T and NK
cells at diagnosis compared with healthy volunteers (Fig. 1A).
Conversely, there was a higher proportion of CD4þ T cells
expressing NKG2D in all patients with metastatic melanoma
compared with healthy volunteers (Fig. 1A, right). These CD4þ
NKG2Dþ T cells differed from the CD4þNKG2D T-cell subset in
that they coexpressed low levels of CD8ab (Fig. 1B) and
exhibited an effector memory (TEM; CD45RACCR7) phenotype (Fig. 1C). Extensive phenotyping showed that about 20% of
CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells expressed the C-type lectin receptor
NKR-P1A (CD161) as described by others (29), but failed to
express other NK receptors (such as 2B4, KIR, NCR, and CD94/
NKG2A) in contrast to previously described CD4þNKG2Dþ T
cells (Fig. 1D; ref. 30). Finally, CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells did not
express the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 associated with T-cell
trafﬁcking into tumor beds (Fig. 1D).
Lymph node resection in high-grade melanoma allowed
us to examine the capacity of CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells to trafﬁc
to tumor beds. Indeed, this subset represented up to 2% to
25% of the CD4þ tumor-inﬁltrating lymph node T cells (Met
lymph node), generally not enriched compared with blood or
nonmetastatic lymph node (non-Met lymph node; when
paired specimen were available; Fig. 2A), and expressed
higher levels of PD-1 (but similar levels of TIM-3) molecules
compared with NKG2D CD4þ T cells (Fig. 2B and C). Of
note, these Met lymph node contained about 73%  20% of
CD45 cells.
Altogether, the regulation of NKG2D expression in CD4þ
versus CD8þ or NK cells is uncoupled in patients with metastatic melanoma. The accumulation of CD4þCD8dim or CD4þ
NKG2Dþ T-cell subset in blood (and tumors) is frequently
observed in melanoma but can also be found in other malignancies (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Th1 polarization of CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells upon
engagement of NKG2D and CD122
First, we analyzed the capacity of CD4þ T cells to secrete
cytokines after engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and/or
NKG2D before therapy. A strong synergistic effect on the
production of IFN-g, IL-2, and TNF-a was observed when both
receptors were triggered (Fig. 3A) in responders as well as in

nonresponders (not shown). Importantly, upon TCR and
NKG2D triggering, this subset failed to produce IL-17 or IL10 (not shown). Intracellular staining revealed that most CD4þ
NKG2Dþ T cells produce both IFN-g and TNF-a (Fig. 3B).
Because IL-15 has been shown to be a key factor in arming an
NKG2D-dependent activation of TCRab CTLs in celiac disease
(31), we addressed whether puriﬁed CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells
could be activated by coengagement of NKG2D and/or CD122
(IL-2Rb common to both IL-2/IL-15 signaling) with a suboptimal cross-linking of CD3 molecules. Although CD4þNKG2D
T cells failed to release IFN-g upon receptor engagement, cellsorted CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells produced high levels of Th1
cytokines after a combined stimulation through TCR, CD122,
and NKG2D (Fig. 3C). To further characterize the functions of
these cells, we performed three additional assays (Supplementary Fig. S4). First, we incubated the NKG2Dþ or NKG2D cell
subset with soluble MICA (sMICA; expected to trigger NKG2D)
and rhIL-15 (expected to stimulate IL-2Rbg) in vitro in the
presence or absence of a TCR engagement. Interestingly,
sMICAþIL-15 could independently of TCR engagement synergistically induce IFN-g secretion in the CD4þNKG2Dþ T-cell
subset (as in NK cells) but not in CD4þNKG2D T cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). However, proliferation of either
NKG2Dþ or NKG2D CD4þ T cells could only be induced
after CD3 cross-linking (Supplementary Fig. S4B). In contrast
to their NKG2D counterparts, the CD4þNKG2Dþ effectors
were also able to recognize and kill melanoma cells (MEL10
cell line) after IL-15 priming (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Sorafenib exposure did not enhance their cytotoxicity, which
might be explained by the reported direct inhibitory activity
of sorafenib on T-cell functions (32). Moreover, as shown
in Fig. 4, IL-15Ra expression was only weakly increased
(Fig. 4D) on the cell surface of MEL10 cells by sorafenib
treatment (Fig. 4E), which could explain why the addition of
IL-15 to engage CD122 was mandatory for the MEL10 cell line.
To follow up on this, we then switched to the melanoma cell
line MEL888, of which sorafenib had shown greater impact on
the expression of IL-15Ra both on mRNA levels and cell surface
(Fig. 4E and D), and tested the activation of CD4þNKG2Dþ T
cells without the addition of exogenous rhIL-15 in the presence
of sorafenib-treated or -untreated MEL888 cells. The result
showed that CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells could only secrete IFN-g in
the presence of sorafenib-treated MEL888 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4D).
Thus, CD4þNKG2Dþ T lymphocytes constituted an TEM
Th1-polarized T-cell subset capable of releasing cytokines
upon TCR engagement with a strong costimulatory activity
of the NKG2D receptor or upon coengagement of CD122 and
NKG2D receptors.

Regulation of IL-15Ra expression by sorafenib in tumor
beds
We analyzed how sorafenib or temozolomide could modulate the expression of the ligands for these receptors in vitro
and in vivo. Lymph node–residing melanoma was reported
to express low levels of NKGD ligands (33). We analyzed
sixteen "paired" but independent tumors (mostly from subcutaneous lesions), before and after three cycles of therapy
by immunohistochemistry of parafﬁn-embedded melanoma.
First, anti-CD3, -CD4, and -CD8 antibody stainings revealed
abundant inﬁltrates that were not signiﬁcantly altered by
therapy (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. S5). The SR99
antibody recognizing MICA/B revealed that the intensity of
the staining seemed moderate to strong on plasma membrane and in the cytosol in all specimens regardless of the
location (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table 2). Of note, no
staining was observed in the epidermal or mesenchymal
cells of normal skin adjacent to the melanoma (not shown).
The expression of MICA/B proteins was maintained by the
therapy in tissue sections (Table 2) although sorafenib could,
with increasing concentrations, downregulate MICA expression on melanoma cell lines in vitro, especially on MEL888
cells (Fig. 4A). Note that treating the MEL888 cells with 10
mmol/L sorafenib for 24 hours led to the release of sMICA/B
in the supernatant (not shown).
We also monitored the IL-15Ra expression on tumor
cells. Immunoﬂuorescence analyses of paired melanoma
pre- and posttherapy using anti-IL-15Ra–speciﬁc antibodies revealed that in most cases (7 of 8 patients), therapy
increased cell-surface expression of IL-15Ra on tumor cells
(Fig. 4B). RT-PCR analyses of 20 tumor biopsies compared
the relative expression of the IL-15Ra gene pre- versus
posttherapy and conﬁrmed, in 4 cases, the upregulation of
transcription or a strong and stable basal expression in 2
cases (Fig. 4C). Corroborating these data, sorafenib induced
cell-surface expression of IL-15Ra and enhanced transcription of IL-15Ra in melanoma lines in vitro (Fig. 4D). Note

that temozolomide was not able to induce IL-15Ra expression in vitro and did not inhibit IL-15Ra expression induced
by sorafenib (not shown). Interestingly, B-RAF or c-KIT
inhibitors (vemurafenib or imatinib) failed to modulate
IL-15Ra in melanoma cell lines in vitro (Fig. 4E). Monitoring
of IL-15Ra on peripheral blood CD14þ cells at baseline and
after two cycles of treatment revealed an upregulation
preferentially in responding patients (Fig. 4F), and in
patients with longer OS (over the median time of survival,
224 days; P ¼ 0.03 with Wilcoxon signed-rank test; data
not shown).
Microarray analysis was performed on 20 paired biopsies
before (day 0) and after treatment (day 21) from 20 patients by
establishing the log ratio (day 21/day 0) to identify genes that
could be modiﬁed by the treatment regardless of the clinical
response. This analysis revealed a cluster of genes among
which IL-15, STAT5, and STAT1 appeared ﬁrst as upregulated
after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6). Because of the limited
number of samples and the absence of a validation set, it was
impossible to perform relevant analysis to distinguish responders from nonresponding patients.
To conclude, sorafenib alone or combined with temozolomide may induce membrane expression of IL-15Ra in vitro and
in vivo in patients with melanoma.
Increase of CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells associated with OS
Given the sorafenib-induced accumulation of CD4þ
NKG2Dþ Th1 cells and IL-15Ra expression in melanoma
lesions, we hypothesized that this subset could inﬂuence
therapeutic outcome. We analyzed potential correlations
between the frequencies of CD4þNKG2Dþ T, CD8þNKG2Dþ
T cells, and CD56þNKG2Dþ NK cells at various time points
with the clinical response evaluated at 2 months and OS. None
of these parameters was associated with clinical response at
any time points (Supplementary Fig. S2C and data not shown).
However, lymphopenia at baseline inﬂuenced OS. Considering
that median survival of the whole cohort is 227 days, patients

Sorafenib Regulates IL-15Ra and NKG2D Ligands

metastatic melanoma where a subpopulation of rare
CD4þ T cells expressing NKG2D is abnormally represented
(compared with healthy volunteers). This subset can be
induced to proliferate after engaging TCR and NKG2D
receptors and to release Th1 cytokines after engaging CD122
and NKG2D receptors.
Several subsets of CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells have been
described. First, in patients with cancer, tumor expression and
shedding of sMICA/B ligand of NKG2D drove the proliferation
of a CD4þNKG2Dþ T cell population that produced IL-10, TGFb, and FasL (34, 35). The expansion of these cells inhibited
bystander CD8þ and CD4þ T-cell proliferation ex vivo. The
same autoreactive T-cell subset was inversely correlated with
disease activity in autoimmune diseases (such as juvenileonset systemic lupus erythematosus). In this report, sMIC
serum levels were also inversely correlated with disease activity
(36). Second, in contrast to this "regulatory" phenotype, a
"proinﬂammatory" and cytolytic CD4þNKG2Dþ T-cell subtype
has been described in autoinﬂammatory diseases such as
Wegener's granulomatosis (37, 38), rheumatoid arthritis (39),
and Crohn's disease (40). In most of these reports, CD4þ
NKG2Dþ T cells harbor an effector-memory phenotype and
express many other NK-cell activating receptors (such as 2B4,
DNAM-1, and CRACC) likely contributing to pathogenesis.
Indeed, coligation of 2B4 in combination with DNAM-1 or
NKG2D enhanced CD4þCD28 T-cell degranulation and IFN-g
secretion engaged through suboptimal TCR triggering (30).
Those TEM CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells were found in Wegener

with prolonged survival (>227 days) exhibited higher lymphocyte counts at baseline compared with rapidly progressive
patients (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the increase of circulating
CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells at two cycles of therapy was associated
with prolonged survival, whereas the parallel decrease of CD8þ
NKG2Dþ or CD56þNKG2Dþ NK cells was not (Fig. 5B and C
and Supplementary Fig. S2D). The elevation of CD4þNKG2Dþ
T-cell subset observed post-sorafenib (combined with temozolomide) was not apparent after miscellaneous lines of conventional therapies (including DTIC, fotemustine, isolated
limb perfusion, vaccines) where long-term or short-term survivors had no more than 2.5% to 3% of CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells
(Fig. 5D). Altogether, it is tempting to speculate that the
accumulation of CD4þNKG2Dþ Th1 cells may be regulated
by a therapy facilitating the exposure of IL-15Ra on tumor cells
and/or circulating monocytes.

Discussion
Here, we report the ﬁrst demonstration that sorafenib
(combined with temozolomide) could (i) increase the proportion of a rare subset of TEM CD4þNKG2Dþ Th1 cells, and
(ii) induce the upregulation of IL-15Ra on monocytes and/or
in tumor sections. NKG2D ligands along with the therapeutic induction of IL-15Ra expression on the plasma membrane of tumor cells (and/or monocytes) could restore/favor
the activation of tumor-inﬁltrating effector lymphocytes. We
show that these molecules are either detectable at baseline
(MICA expression) or induced by sorafenib (IL-15Ra) in

granulomata in close association with MICþ and IL-15þ cells
and CD208 dendritic cells (37). It is known that IL-15 upregulates NKG2D expression on T cells and MIC expression on
inﬂamed tissues and drives TEM differentiation and proliferation, culminating in exacerbation of autoimmune diseases
(39, 41). Meresse and colleagues elegantly demonstrated in
CD8þ T cells that dysregulated IL-15 expression promotes the
NKG2D/DAP10 signaling pathway leading to CTL cytotoxic
activity independently of the engagement of the TCR, transforming CTL into "LAK-like"LAK-like cells (31). As for CD8þ T
cells, lamina propria CD4þ T cells from Crohn's disease
expressing NKG2D, Th1 cytokines, and perforin were functionally active through MICA/NKG2D interactions (40). Third,
an increased frequency of double-positive CD4þCD8þab T
cells (DP cells) was reported in Hodgkin lymphoma, human
breast cancer pleural effusions (29), and in melanoma (42).
However, these DP cells express high levels of CD8ab, low
levels of CD4, and produce Th2 cytokines upon HLA class I–
restricted recognition of tumor cells and normal cells, suggesting that they are "regulatory" CD8þ T cells speciﬁc for selfantigens. Fourth, Maccalli and colleagues characterized CD4
and CD8 T-cell clones from melanoma lesions for their
dependency on TCR versus NKG2D in the recognition patterns of melanoma cells. Very few T-cell clones were CD4þ
NKG2Dþ and they recognized tumor cells mainly in a MHC
class II–dependent fashion. Moreover, MICA/B expression
was rather low in lymph node melanoma, whereas ULBP-2
was more prominent and functionally relevant (33). In our
report, CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells shared biologic and functional
features with proinﬂammatory CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells. Indeed,
the CD4þNKG2Dþ T-cell subset that we observed in these
patients with metastatic melanoma were enriched with TEM
cells, expressed low levels of CD8ab and high levels of CD4,
secreted Th1 cytokines, and could proliferate upon suboptimal TCR triggering along with NKG2D and/or CD122 engagement. The major difference is the lack of NK cell receptor
expression. Only NKG2D and CD161 (29, 41–44) were
expressed in this cohort CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells.
The proof-of-principle that CD4þ T cells can be therapeutically harnessed against metastatic melanoma has been
brought up by Hunder and colleagues, where they used IL-2
and IL-7 to differentiate tumor-speciﬁc CD4þ T cells (43).
Others have found that na€ve CD4þ T cells after adoptive Tcell transfer can be cytotoxic and highly contribute to tumor
rejection (45). Such efﬁcient T-cell response strongly relied
upon lymphopenia and common g chain (such as IL-15).
Furthermore, an appropriate dendritic cell or monocyte/
CD4þ T-cell cross-talk will lead to both IL-15–driven IL-12
production by dendritic cell, and enhanced proliferation and
polarization of Th1 cells (46). Cytokine/antibody immune
complexes to IL-15 or IL-2 or IL-7 may mimic the effects of
lymphopenia required for such an efﬁcient triggering of
na€ve CD4þ T cells. Therefore, it is likely that the combination of temozolomide and sorafenib, through prolonged
lymphopenia, may foster an environment for the proper
polarization and expansion of effector CD4þ T cells in a
tumor milieu providing the right costimulatory molecules
(IL-15Ra and MICA/B). Supporting this premise, our tran-

scriptional proﬁling indicates that the IL-15/IL-15Ra signaling pathway and Th1 signatures are induced in lesions
posttherapy (Supplementary Fig. S6).
In the absence of IL-15Ra induction, however, many strategies could be envisaged to compensate these patients. Cis- or
trans-stimulating IL-2Rbg through stabilized IL-15–based
approaches have been tested in preclinical models (47). Indeed,
IL-15/IL-15Ra-Fc, IL-15/IL-15Ra fusion proteins, IL-15 fused
to the human antibody fragment (scFv) speciﬁc of a tumor
antigen or the tumor stromal ﬁbroblast activation protein, IL15 gene therapy (such as the hydrodynamic injection of plasmids encoding IL-15 or IL-15 engineered oncolytic viruses)
have all been reported to be efﬁcient against mouse tumors.
Our data suggest that a subset of CD4þ T cells (expressing
NKG2D) becomes biologically signiﬁcant in that they may be
engaged by IL-15Ra and MICA/B expressed on tumor cells
and/or monocytes (either through sorafenib or spontaneously,
respectively) to secrete high levels of Th1 cytokines. We cannot
exclude that other NKG2Dþ-expressing effectors could be
implicated as we could also monitor CD8þ T cells inﬁltrating tumors. However, it seems that only CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells
could be augmented after two cycles of therapy, which turned
out to be clinically relevant and associated with longer OS.
In conclusion, our data suggest that CD4þNKG2Dþ T cells
could be tuned functionally by induction of IL-15Ra. This
observation could have some clinical impact, as compounds
inducing or mimicking IL-15 transpresentation are currently
under development for the treatment of cancer.
