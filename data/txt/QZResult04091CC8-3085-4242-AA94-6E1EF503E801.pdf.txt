Abstract:

Vosaroxin (formerly voreloxin) is a first-in-class anticancer quinolone derivative
that intercalates DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, inducing site-selective
double-strand breaks (DSB), G2 arrest and apoptosis. Objective responses and
complete remissions were observed in phase 2 studies of vosaroxin in patients
with solid and hematologic malignancies, and responses were seen in patients
whose cancers were resistant to anthracyclines. The quinolone-based scaffold
differentiates vosaroxin from the anthracyclines and anthracenediones, broadly
used DNA intercalating topoisomerase II poisons. Here we report that vosaroxin
induces a cell cycle specific pattern of DNA damage and repair that is distinct from
the anthracycline, doxorubicin. Both drugs stall replication and preferentially
induce DNA damage in replicating cells, with damage in G2 / M > S >> G1.
However, detectable replication fork collapse, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation
and long tract recombination during S phase, is induced only by doxorubicin.
Furthermore, vosaroxin induces less overall DNA fragmentation. Homologous
recombination repair (HRR) is critical for recovery from DNA damage induced
by both agents, identifying the potential to clinically exploit synthetic lethality.

INTRODUCTION

shares with the anthracyclines and anthracenediones. In
contrast the epipodophyllotoxins do not intercalate DNA
and directly interact with topoisomerase II.
Topoisomerase II exists in two isoforms, α
and β, of which topoisomerase IIα has been studied
most extensively. The enzyme is essential for the
maintenance of DNA topology, disentangling DNA
following replication, and is required to maintain
correct chromosome condensation, decondensation, and
segregation [12-14]. Expression of topoisomerase IIα
is highest in mitotic cells and peaks at G2 / M phase of
the cell cycle [12, 15, 16]. Hallmarks of topoisomerase
II poisoning are the induction of DNA double-strand
breaks (DSB) and G2 arrest [17]. However, the nature of
the drug / enzyme / DNA interaction drives the specifics

Quinolone derivatives have recently been described
as an alternative scaffold to the classic antineoplastic
topoisomerase II poisons, including the anthracyclines,
anthracenediones and epipodophyllotoxins [1-5]. These
drugs are broadly used in the treatment of both solid and
hematologic malignancies [6-8]. Objective responses and
complete remissions in phase 2 studies of acute myeloid
leukemia and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer were
observed with vosaroxin (formerly voreloxin), a firstin-class anticancer quinolone derivative [9-11]. In both
settings, responses were seen in patients whose cancers
were resistant to anthracyclines. Vosaroxin is a DNA
intercalating topoisomerase II poison [1], a feature it

anthracyclines [20, 24, 27, 28]. These anthracyclineinduced processes are not dependent upon the levels of
expression of topoisomerase II, and the relative roles of
each of them in the clinical activity and toxicity of the
compounds is not fully established [8, 20, 22]. In contrast
vosaroxin generates minimal ROS and the generation of
ROS or DNA alkylation are not associated with the core
quinolone structure [1].
Identification of the processes that repair vosaroxininduced DNA DSB is critical for the further development
of rational, clinically testable hypotheses that direct the
selection of target indications and subpopulations. Two
major pathways are active in the repair of DNA DSB;
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous
recombination repair (HRR). The complexities of these
pathways are reviewed by Wyman and Kanaar [29]. The
phase of the cell cycle in which DNA damage is induced
is critical in determining which of the response processes
predominate. Because HRR requires a donor, homologous

of DNA damage including sequence selectivity, location
and extent of the induced DSBs, and the phase of the cell
cycle in which they arise. Consequently the molecular
characteristics of the drug-induced DNA damage and
DNA damage response cannot be extrapolated directly
from one molecular scaffold to another, based simply
upon a common enzyme target. Thus the non-intercalating
topoisomerase II poison etoposide causes extensive
DNA laddering, while vosaroxin intercalates DNA and
induces site-selective DNA DSB at G/C rich sequences
[1], a characteristic of the quinolone core structure [18].
Further, although the anthracyclines are also DNAintercalating topoisomerase II poisons, they drive
additional DNA damage through non-topoisomerase II
mediated mechanisms, including the induction of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [19, 20]. The generation of ROS
results in the formation of base mutations, anthracyclineDNA adducts and cross-links [21-26], and is linked to
the scaffold-based cardiomyopathy associated with the

Figure 1: Vosaroxin- and doxorubicin -induced DNA DSB are increased in replicating cells. The cell cycle dependence of
vosaroxin-induced DNA damage was investigated using MO59K glioma cells which are large and highly adherent, and thus amenable to
centrosome staining and analysis via immunofluorescence. Cells were treated for 6 hours with 1 or 9 µM vosaroxin (A) or 1 µM vosaroxin or
0.1 µM doxorubicin (B). Average γH2AX fluorescence intensity is displayed, with each symbol representing one cell. Cell cycle phases were
established by analysis of centrosome size and number, and representative images are shown in Figure S1. The number of cells counted per
phase is shown (n). Mean intensity is represented by horizontal line on the graph and listed below with standard error of the mean (SEM). Data
are representative of three (vosaroxin) and two (doxorubicin) independent experiments.

RESULTS

DNA sequence to replace the damaged region, this process
is prevalent in mitotic cells when a copy of the target DNA
is available for exchange [30]. The characteristics of the
DNA damage further subdivide the molecular nature of
the HRR response [31, 32].
The focus of the current investigation was the analysis
of the cell cycle phase specific toxicity of vosaroxin, and
the identification of the DNA damage response processes
that are critical to recovery from the associated toxic
lesions. As a component of anthracycline toxicity is
mediated through DNA intercalation and topoisomerase
II poisoning, vosaroxin and doxorubicin were compared
and contrasted in experiments that analyzed the extent and
timing of DNA damage and cytotoxicity, and the DNA
damage response mechanisms involved in repair of the
damage. Understanding the processes that are essential for
recovery from vosaroxin exposure will facilitate clinical
exploitation of synthetic lethality.

The cell-cycle dependence of vosaroxin-induced
DNA damage was investigated using MO59K glioma
cells. Cell cycle phases were defined by centrosome
size and number into G1 (single small centrosome),
late S / G2 (larger centrosome) and late G2 / M (2
centrosomes) phases. Representative images are shown in
Supplementary Figure 1. DNA damage was evaluated by
staining for γH2AX and quantifying the stain intensity per
nucleus, which is more diagnostic of DSB than overall
γH2AX staining [33]. As shown in Figure 1, vosaroxin

in late S / G2 / M. In comparison with an equitoxic dose
of doxorubicin (0.1 µM), vosaroxin induced less overall
DNA damage.

a higher number of DNA fragments in the 1.6 – 0.2 Mbp
range that were reduced in the presence of S phase block
(Figure 2). A similar effect was previously reported for
etoposide-induced DSBs [34].These data, combined with
the DNA damage data shown in Figure 1, suggest that the
vosaroxin-induced DNA fragmentation is distinct from
that induced by doxorubicin and occurs during the G2 / M
phases, while being undetectable during S phase.

The vosaroxin-induced DNA fragmentation
pattern differs from that of doxorubicin
We have previously reported that vosaroxin induces
dose-dependent and site-selective DNA fragmentation [1].
In the present study, the dependence of fragmentation upon
active DNA synthesis was investigated and compared with
doxorubicin. To ensure detectable DNA fragmentation,
relatively high doses of vosaroxin (20 µM) and doxorubicin
(3 µM) were used, with or without aphidicolin to induce
an S phase block. SPD8 cells were exposed to drug or
vehicle control for 4 hrs, prior to fragmentation analysis
by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Vosaroxininduced DNA fragmentation appeared unaffected by
aphidicolin (Figure 2). In contrast, doxorubicin induced

with or without aphidicolin, followed by 7 day colony
growth in drug-free media. Although S phase independent

is the dose-dependent S phase prolongation induced
by vosaroxin (Supplementary Figure 2). In contrast,
vosaroxin-induced long tract recombination, as detected
by hprt reversion, was not detectably reduced by S
phase block (Figure 4B), suggesting that HR-mediated
reversion events occur principally if not exclusively at
G2 / M. Contrasting with vosaroxin, doxorubicin-induced
recombination events were modestly but significantly
reduced by S phase block (p = 0.04), indicating that
long tract recombination contributes to the repair of
doxorubicin-induced DNA damage both during and
independent of DNA synthesis. The moderate level of
reversion events that were induced by both drugs is
representative of topoisomerase II targeting agents [34].

Vosaroxin-induced DNA damage is repaired by
HRR processes that are cell cycle phase specific
and are differentiated from doxorubicin
HRR has been shown previously to be involved in
the repair of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage [23] and
plays a major role in DNA DSB repair during S and G2 / M
phases of the cell cycle (reviewed by Helleday et al [30]).
To further elucidate vosaroxin’s molecular mechanism of
action, and to identify cellular backgrounds which may
be particularly sensitive to the drug, the contribution of
HRR to the repair of vosaroxin-induced DNA damage
was investigated and compared with doxorubicin. Both
the activation of HRR and the implementation of long
tract recombination were assessed. HRR activation was
detected by analysis of RAD51 focus formation, which
serves as an early HRR signal with broad substrate
specificity [34]. As shown in Figure 4A, exposure for 4
hr to either doxorubicin or vosaroxin triggered RAD51
foci formation. The blockade of DNA synthesis reduced
the number of foci to levels comparable with (vosaroxin)
or below (doxorubicin) the level of aphidicolin control,
indicating that the detected foci represent HRR triggered
during active DNA synthesis. Consistent with these data

HRR compromised cells are sensitized to
vosaroxin and doxorubicin
The CHO AA8 RAD51D mutant cell line (clone
51D1) harbors a genetic knockout of RAD51D and shows
increased sensitivity to DNA DSB-inducing agents, while
the matched line (clone 51D1.3) is reconstituted for
RAD51D expression [35]. These cell lines were used to
examine the role of HRR in recovery from vosaroxin and
doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure

3 independent experiments, error bars represent SEM. B) S phase block reduces doxorubicin-induced but not vosaroxin-induced long tract

vosaroxin or doxorubicin plus aphidicolin (+Aph) to arrest cells in S phase. Controls were treated with DMSO only (C). The same population
of treated cells were plated for cloning efficiency (Figure 3). Revertants / recombinants were selected by growth for 7 days in the presence of
HAsT. The horizontal dashed line denotes reversion / recombination in the presence of aphicicolin control. To determine S phase dependent
recombination events that are induced by each drug, the number of recombination events in the presence of drug + Aph are subtracted from
the number of events with drug alone (ie; revertants with vosaroxin alone minus vosaroxin + Aph). No significant difference was detected for
vosaroxin. A modest but significant difference was detected for doxorubicin (p=0.04). Data are plotted as revertants / 105 cells, and represent
the mean of 3 independent experiments. Error bars represent SEM.

fold more sensitive to vosaroxin-induced inhibition of
proliferation, and 12.5-fold more sensitive to doxorubicin.
Further, as shown in Supplementary Figure 3, increased
sensitivity to vosaroxin-induced G2 arrest was observed
in the HRR compromised mutant background. Onset of
arrest was observed at 0.004 µM as compared to 0.037
µM (approximately 10-fold shift) in the HRR competent
cell line.
To confirm that the enhanced sensitivity of HRR
compromised cells is a function of reduced ability to repair
vosaroxin- or doxorubicin- induced DNA damage, DNA
repair was evaluated over time following 6 hr exposure to
the compounds. Cells were treated with equitoxic doses of
vosaroxin, doxorubicin or with DMSO control, followed

by washout and quantification of RAD51 foci over
time. As shown in Figure 5B, within 16 hr the number
of detectable foci in vosaroxin- or doxorubicin-treated
HRR competent cells was reduced to levels comparable
with DMSO-treated controls, whereas HRR compromised
cells sustained levels of foci that were significantly above
background levels for the duration of the assay (40 hr).
Thus the enhanced sensitivity to both vosaroxin or
doxorubicin of HRR compromised cells correlates with
an impaired ability to repair drug-induced DNA DSB.

BRCA2 deficiency sensitizes cells to vosaroxin
and doxorubicin

recombination events during DNA synthesis.

DISCUSSION

The role of BRCA2 in HRR, and the established
synthetic lethality of molecules targeting DNA damage
and repair in the BRCA2 mutant background [36-38],
prompted the analysis of vosaroxin sensitivity in CHO cell
lines mutant (V-C8) and competent for BRCA2 (V-C8B2,
BRCA2 reconsitituted) [39]. BRCA2 mutation sensitized
cells to inhibition of proliferation by both vosaroxin (5.1fold) and, in keeping with data reported by Spencer et al
[23], doxorubicin (3.8 fold) (Figure 6A). Further, in the
U20S human sarcoma cell line, siRNA knockdown of
BRCA2 induced a 4.6-fold sensitization to colony growth
inhibition by both vosaroxin and doxorubicin (Figure
6B). Thus the cytotoxicity of both agents is influenced
to a comparable extent by the functionality of the HRR
pathway, despite differential induction of HRR-mediated

The studies reported here provide molecular detail
of the mechanism of action of vosaroxin, the first of a new
class of antineoplastic agents, the anticancer quinolone
derivatives. These data establish that vosaroxin-induced
DNA DSB are preferential for replicating cells. Consistent
with the interdependence of DNA repair mechanisms,
DNA replication and cell cycle checkpoints [40, 41], the
mechanisms invoked to repair these DSB differ with cell
cycle phase. Further, several points of differentiation from
the classic topoisomerase II poison, doxorubicin, were
identified, largely occurring during the S phase of the cell
cycle.

vosaroxin, doxorubicin, or with DMSO control. Inhibition of proliferation was evaluated following 5 days incubation and is represented as
percent of DMSO control. Graphs represent the mean of 2 independent experiments and error bars represent SEM. The shift in IC50 between
cell lines is shown for each compound. B) BRCA2 knockdown sensitizes cells equally to vosaroxin and doxorubicin. siRNA knockdown of
BRCA2 was performed in U20S human sarcoma cells, followed by treatment with a dose-titration of vosaroxin or doxorubicin, or with DMSO
control. Colony growth inhibition was evaluated following 14 days incubation and is graphed relative to DMSO control. Error bars represent
SEM. The efficiency of knockdown at 24 and 48 hr post transfection, with BRCA2 siRNA or transfection agent alone (-) is shown. The shift in
IC50 between conditions is shown for each compound.

analyze the cell cycle phase of DNA DSB induction by
topoisomerase II targeting agents [42], and with the peak
in expression of topoisomerase IIα at the G2 phase of the
cell cycle [7, 12, 13, 15]. Both vosaroxin and doxorubicin
induced DSB during G2 / M, as established by detectable
DNA fragmentation and consequent HRR-mediated long
tract recombination. Consistent with these observations,
the majority of vosaroxin and doxorubicin-induced

cytotoxicity occurred independent of S phase, indicating
that the DSB induced during G2 / M are the principal
cause of cytotoxicity.
Points of contrast between vosaroxin and doxorubicin
were identified in their S phase-induced DNA damage
and associated DNA damage responses. Allthough
vosaroxin’s S phase-induced DNA damage triggered the
HRR response, as detected by RAD51 focus formation,

Figure 7: Model for induction of differential, cell cycle phase specific DNA damage and HRR processes following exposure
to vosaroxin or doxorubicin. DNA in G2 / M phase is shown on the left, with the replication fork advancing during S phase to the right.

Points of homologous recombination are depicted by X, with the region exchanged depicted by the horizontal arrow. These regions also
represent potential DNA fragments in the absence of DNA repair. A) Vosaroxin-induced DNA damage is depicted in the upper model, where the
replication fork is stalled due to topologic stress in DNA, resulting in a prolonged S phase and the induction of RAD51 foci. Replication fork
collapse is either below detectable levels or is absent, evidenced by undetectable DNA fragmentation or HRR-mediated long tract recombination
during S phase. The toxicity of S phase induced lesions is low. In G2 / M phase, DNA DSB induction is maximal, inducing detectable DNA
fragmentation, HRR-mediated long tract recombination and maximal toxicity. B) Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage is depicted in the lower
model, where in addition to cleavable complexes base mutations, DNA cross-linking and DNA adducts are also generated. The advancing
replication fork encounters torsional stress in the DNA and RAD51 foci are induced. A proportion of active replication forks collide with DNA
lesions (shown here as a DNA adduct), inducing DNA fragmentation (represented by the horizontal arrows) and long tract recombination,
indicating replication fork collapse. Sites for additional potential fork collapse are shown by the X, in regions of doxorubicin-DNA cross links
and adducts. Fewer DNA DSB are formed in S phase than in G2 / M and cytotoxicity of the lesions is lower. In G2 / M phase, DNA DSB
induction is maximal, resulting in increased DNA fragmentation, HRR-mediated long tract recombination and maximal toxicity. Because of
the increased number and / or diversity of DNA interactions, DNA DSB induction and fragmentation is greater than that induced by vosaroxin,
so generating an increased number of smaller (1.6 – 0.2 Mbp) fragments. This is represented by the increased number of, and smaller size of,
the horizontal arrows.

this DNA damage was not associated with detectable
DSBs or recombination. This indicates that replication
fork collapse is absent in vosaroxin-treated cells, or
occurs below the level of detection. Vosaroxin did induce
a dose-dependent S phase delay, suggesting that cleavable
complexes form a replication fork barrier, consistent with
previously reported data [43]. Contrasting with vosaroxin,
a greater number of DNA fragments (0.2 – 1.6 Mbp) were
induced by doxorubicin, which also caused replication
fork collapse as evidenced by detectable levels of DNA
fragmentation and long tract recombination during S
phase.
These data are summarized in a model in which
vosaroxin induces two major forms of toxic DNA lesion
that are repaired by HRR, and are generated during
different phases of the cell cycle (Figure 7A). During
DNA synthesis in vosaroxin treated cells, the replication
fork may encounter torsional stress due to cleavage
complexes in proximity to the sites of DNA replication.
The HRR response is activated and localized to the
region of the replication fork which stalls, slowing DNA
synthesis. The advancing fork does not collide with the
lesion or collapse, thus DNA fragmentation and long
tract recombination are undetectable and the toxicity of
these lesions is low. During G2 / M, where the cell is
actively dividing and when topoisomerase IIα expression
is elevated, vosaroxin induces an increased number of
topoisomerase II-mediated DSB and detectable DNA
fragmentation, maximizing cytotoxicity during this phase.
Long tract repair via HR contributes to cellular recovery
from the damage.
Replication forks collapse when they collide with
regions of damaged DNA, and when DNA repair processes
are unable to stabilize or re-start stalled or blocked forks
[40, 44]. The combined effects of disparity in both number
and mode of molecular interactions with DNA, as a
consequence of their contrasting chemical structures [1],
is a plausible explanation for the differences in the DNA
damage and HRR induced by vosaroxin and doxorubicin,
and is represented as a model in Figure 7B. Although both
drugs intercalate DNA and poison topoisomerase II, the
anthracyclines induce DNA damage through additional,
non topoisomerase II-mediated mechanisms [20, 22],
including the induction of ROS. Anthracycline-induced
ROS generate mutagenic base modifications [19, 45]
and drive the formation of additional bulky lesions in
the form of DNA adducts and crosslinks [21-26], lesions
which cause replication fork stall [40, 46] and collapse
[47]. HR plays a role in the repair of these forms of
damage [23, 47, 48], and the DSB caused by interstrand
crosslinks are in particular associated with the S phase of
the cell cycle [49]. Following doxorubicin treatment these
diverse drug / DNA interactions may induce enough S
phase DNA damage and / or generate a particularly toxic
form of lesion(s), to drive the observed replication fork
collapse. The contributions of the different anthracyclinewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DNA interactions to cytotoxicity of the drugs are as
yet unresolved [20, 22]. In contrast vosaroxin produces
minimal ROS [1] and the generation of ROS or DNA
alkylation are not characteristics of the quinolone core.
Thus vosaroxin may produce fewer bulky lesions in S
phase, predominantly in the form of topoisomerase II
cleavage complexes, a consequence of which is minimal
or absent replication fork collapse. The overall reduction
in DNA fragmentation, relative to doxorubicin, may also
be attributable to these contrasts in molecular reactivity.
Despite these molecular mechanistic differences,
vosaroxin induced S phase dependent toxicity that was
comparable with doxorubicin. This may be due to a
requirement for cells to pass through S phase and reach
G2 / M phases where vosaroxin activity is maximal.
The increased vosaroxin sensitivity of HRR mutant
cells forms the basis of a clinically testable hypothesis,
exploiting synthetic lethality to target identifiable
subpopulations which may be particularly sensitive to
the drug. These include tumors harboring mutations in
BRCA1 and 2, which impair HRR and increase sensitivity
to drugs that target DNA repair pathways [36-38, 50].
Indications harboring such mutations include breast
(particularly triple negative breast cancer), prostate and
ovarian cancers [50-53].
Collectively, the data reported here establish a
cell cycle phase specific pattern of vosaroxin-induced
DNA damage and fragmentation, and the reflection of
these in the induction of critical, phase-specific HRR
response processes. Points of contrast between vosaroxin
and doxorubicin in the extent and timing of DNA
fragmentation, and the phase-specific HRR processes that
are induced, highlight molecular mechanistic divergence
between these structurally unrelated topoisomaerase II
poisons. These mechanistic observations are critical to
the generation of clinically testable hypotheses that drive
rational drug development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture
MO59K, A549 and U20S cell lines were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection. RAD51D1 and
RAD51D1.3 Chinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO) matched
clones were the kind gift of Dr Lawrence Thompson,
Lawrence Livermore Research Laboratories, CA. The
CHO cell lines SPD8, VC8 and VC8B2 have been
previously described [38, 54].
A549, MO59K and RAD51D matched clones were
cultured and maintained at 37ºC and 5% CO2 atmosphere
in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Cellgro). U20S and VC8 cell lines were cultured
and maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium

(see below). Cells were washed with PBS and incubated
in the dark for 1 hr at room temperature in secondary
antibodies (see below). Cells were then washed in PBS
and nuclei stained by adding 1 ug/ml Hoechst 33342 in
PBS to each of the wells. The cells were analyzed using
an ArrayScan high content screening device. Nuclei were
identified as objects based on the Hoechst 33342 stain.
γH2AX staining: γH2AX was detected using mouse
anti- γH2AX (Upstate 05-636) diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA
in PBS. Secondary antibody, AlexaFluor 594-conjugated
goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen A31623), was diluted 1:300
in 1% BSA in PBS. For MO59K cells, the mean γH2AX
intensity was measured for each nucleus. For RAD51D1
and D1.3 cells γH2AX foci were counted within each
nucleus, and a cell was considered to be positive for
γH2AX if the nucleus contained >5 foci.
Pericentrin staining: Pericentrin was detected using
rabbit anti-pericentrin (Abcam; ab4448) diluted to 1:1000
in 1% BSA in PBS. Secondary antibody, AlexaFluor
488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody
(Invitrogen, A11008), was diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA in
PBS. Cells were assigned to cell cycle phases as follows:
small single nucleus, G1; larger, more diffuse nucleus, late
S / G2; two nuclei, M.

(DMEM), with the addition of 9% fetal calf serum and
penicillin-streptomycin (90 U/mL) at 37ºC and 5% CO2
atmosphere. VC8-B2 cells were cultured in DMEM as
above, with the addition of G418 (Sigma Aldrich) to 100
µg/mL. SPD8 cells were cultured in DMEM containing
9% fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin and
6-Thioguanine (6TG, 5 µg/mL; Sigma Aldrich) in order
to kill cells that undergo spontaneous reversion.
The SPD8 cell line contains an inactivating partial
duplication of the hprt gene that serves as an endogenous
readout for HRR; a functional gene is regenerated through
reversion mediated by long tract HRR [54]. These cells
were therefore used to evaluate the induction of HRmediated reversion following treatment with compound.
The same cells were used for compound-induced
DNA fragmentation, cytotoxicity and HRR activation
experiments, allowing for the evaluation of the HRR
response in a consistent cellular background.
The CHO AA8 RAD51D mutant cell line (clone
51D1) harbors a genetic knockout of RAD51D and shows
increased sensitivity to DNA DSB-inducing agents,
while the matched line (clone 51D1.3) is reconstituted
for RAD51D expression [35]. These cells were used to
examine the drug sensitivity of HRR compromised cells.
The VC8 cell line has a truncating mutation in the
brca2 gene and VC8-B2 is this cell line complemented
with the human chromosome 13 (containing the brca2
gene) [39]. These cells were used to evaluate the role
of BRCA2 in recovery from compound-induced DNA
damage.

Detection of γH2AX foci inRAD51D CHO cells:
RAD51D1 and RAD51D1.3 cells were seeded
overnight at 10,000 / well in 96-well plates, followed by 6
hr treatment with compound or DMSO control diluted in
growth media. Each treatment was performed in duplicate.
Cells were then washed with fresh media and grown in
the absence of compound. At washout and 16, 24, and 40
hr post washout the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and
stained for nuclei and γH2AX as described above.

Reagents
Aphidicolin (Sigma Aldrich), doxorubicin (Sigma
Aldrich) and vosaroxin (Sunesis Pharmaceuticals) were
dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to a maximal
final DMSO concentration of 0.2%.

Detection of RAD51 foci in SPD8 cells:
Cells were seeded overnight at 8,000 / well in 96well plates, followed by 4 hr treatment with vosaroxin
or doxorubicin +/- aphidicolin, aphidicolin alone or with
DMSO control diluted in growth media. Cells were fixed
for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS-T (PBS + 0.1%
Triton X-100), washed in PBS, permeabilized with PBS +
0.3% Triton X-100 and blocked for 40 mins with 3% BSA
in PBS. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 oC with rabbit
anti-RAD51 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-92) diluted
1:1000 in 3% BSA in PBS. Following PBS wash cells
were labeled for 1 hr, at room temperature in the dark,
with alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen,
A31629) diluted 1:500 in 3% BSA. After PBS wash, cells
were stained for 5 mins at room temperature with 50 µL
DAPI (1 µg/mL), washed and analyzed using an INCell
Analyzer 1000 (GE Healthcare). Images were analysed
using the INCell Analyzer 1000 Workstation software (GE
Healthcare), counting at least 300 nuclei per treatment
condition. Each treatment was performed in sextuplicte or
septuplicate. A cell was considered as positive for RAD51

and stained for γH2AX and pericentrin as follows.
Cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 10 mins with
0.2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Paraformaldehyde was
removed and the cells permeabilized for 5 mins with 0.5%
TritonX-100, then washed with PBS and fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 mins. Following a PBS
wash, cells were blocked for 1 hr with 5% BSA in PBS
and incubated overnight at 4oC with primary antibodies

treated (in duplicates) with a dose-titration of vosaroxin,
or with DMSO control, for 72 hr. After treatment, MTT
reagent (5 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) was added directly to
the media and incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 2 h. MTT
lysis buffer was added and cells were incubated at 37°C/5%
CO2 overnight. Samples were analyzed by measuring the
light absorbance at 595 nm using a SpectraMax plate
reader (Molecular Devices). Values obtained for treatment
samples were normalized to control samples.

Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE)
SPD8 cells were seeded overnight at 2x106 /75
cm flasks, followed by 4 hr treatment with vosaroxin or
doxorubicin +/- aphidicolin. Cells were washed with PBS
before being melted into agarose inserts (1x106 cells/70
µL 1% InCert Agarose, BMA), cooled at 4 oC and placed
in sarcosyl solution (1% N-laurylsarcosyl, 1 mg/mL
proteinase K, 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0) at 50°C for 48 hours.
Control inserts were irradiated with 50 Gy γ-irradiation
in a Cs137 chamber (1.9 Gy/min) prior to incubation in
sarcosyl solution. Inserts were rinsed 4 times for 2 hrs
in TE and loaded into the wells of a 1% Chromosomal
grade agarose gel (BioRad). Separation was performed
on a CHEF DR III (BioRad; 120°, field switch 60-240
sec, 4 V/cm) for 24 hr at 14 oC. The gel was stained with
ethidium bromide for 5 hours and subsequently analyzed
by scanning fluorescence reader (Molecular Imager FX,
Biorad) using Quantative One software.

Measurement of VC8 and VC8-B2 proliferation
by resazurin
VC8 and VC8-B2 cells were plated and grown
overnight in 96-well plates at 4000 cells/well and treated
for 4 hr (in duplicate) with serial dilution of drug or with
vehicle control. Following PBS rinse cells were incubated
for 5 days before staining with resazurin (10µg/mL
DMEM). Fluorescence was measured using the Envision
plate reader (Ex530nm/Em590nm, Perkin Elmer) and
growth inhibition plotted as percentage fluorescence
compared to untreated cells.

Colony growth inhibition

siRNA knockdown and U20S Colony growth
inhibition

SPD8 cells were seeded at 1.5 x 106/75 cm2 flask and
incubated 24 hr prior to 4 hr treatment with vosaroxin,
doxorubicin or DMSO control +/- aphidicolin. Compound
was washed out and cells incubated for 48 hrs, then plated
in duplicate in 10 cm dishes at 500 cells / dish (or seeded
for reversion assay analysis as described below). After 7
day incubation the plates were harvested and the colonies
fixed and stained using methylene blue in methanol (4
g/L). Colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted.

U20S human sarcoma cells were seeded in 6 well
plates, 2 x 105 / well, and incubated overnight. Cells
were transfected with 100 pmol siBRCA2 (siGenome
SMARTpool, 5’-GAAACGGACUUGCUAUUUA-3’,
5’-GUAAAGAAAUGCAGAAUUC-3’,
5’-GGUAUCAGAUGCUUCAUUA-3’,
5’-GAAGAAUGCAGGUUUAAUA-3’
Dharmacon)
mixed with 2 µL DharmaFect 1 (Dharmacon), or with
transfection reagent alone, in a total volume of 2 mL
antibiotic free media. Following 24 hr incubation cells
were trypsinized, counted and seeded into 10 cm plates at
500 or 1000 cells / plate. After 4 hr incubation cells were
treated with a dose-titration of vosaroxin or doxorubicin
and incubated for 14 days. Colonies were fixed and stained
using methylene blue as described above.

Reversion assay
SPD8 cells were seeded and treated as described
above for analysis of colony growth inhibition, thus
cytotoxicity and reversion are established from the
same population of treated cells. For reversion analysis,
following drug exposure, washout and recovery, cells were
seeded in triplicates at 3 x 105 cells / dish in the presence
of HAsT (50 µM hypoxanthine,10 µM L-azaserine, 5
µM thymidine) to select for revertants to wild type hprt,
and incubated for 10 days. Plates were harvested and
the colonies fixed and stained using methylene blue in
methanol (4 g/L). Colonies containing more than 50 cells
were counted.

Western blot
Cell lysates were separated on a 3-8% Tris-Acetate
gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane
cut to allow dual analysis of target and control antigen
and incubated overnight at 4oC in either mouse anti-PARP
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, clone PARP-1 (F-2) or mouse
anti-BRCA2 (Calbiochem, OP95) antibody, diluted
1:500 in 5% milk-TBST. Membranes were washed in
TBST, incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with HRPconjugated anti-mouse antibody (Millipore, AP501P),
washed and developed using chemiluminescence (Roche).
