Abstract
Thymoma is the most commonly identified cancer in the anterior mediastinum.
To date, the causal mechanism that drives thymoma progression is not clear. Here,
we generated K5-∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 transgenic mice, which express an N-terminal
deletion mutant of β-catenin fused to a mutated ligand-binding domain of estrogen
receptor (ERT2) under the control of the bovine cytokeratin 5 (K5) promoter. The
transgenic mouse lines named Tg1 and Tg4 were characterized. Forced expression
of ∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 in the Tg1 and Tg4 mice developed small thymoma lesions in
response to tamoxifen treatment. In the absence of tamoxifen, the Tg1 mice exhibited
leaky activation of β-catenin, which activated the TOP-Gal transgene and Wnt/βcatenin-targeted genes. As the Tg1 mice aged in the absence of tamoxifen, manifest
thymomas were found at 10-12 months. Interestingly, we detected loss of AIRE and
increase of p63 in the thymomas of Tg1 mice, similar to that observed in human
thymomas. Moreover, the β5t protease subunit, which was reported as a differential
marker for human type B3 thymoma, was expressed in the Tg1 thymomas. Thus,
the Tg1 mice generated in this study accurately mimic the characteristics of human
thymomas and may serve as a model for understanding thymoma pathogenesis.

Introduction

AIRE [6, 8-12] and UEA-1 [5, 13-15], whereas cTECs
express β5t [12, 16, 17] and Ly51 [6, 12]; these additional
markers can be used to further sub-classify EpCAM+ TEC
populations in the physiological or pathological thymus.
Tumors arising from TECs are called thymomas
or thymic carcinomas and account for 0.2%-1.5% of all
cancers types [18, 19]. Classification of thymic epithelial
tumors is mainly based on the histological features of the
tumor, including epithelial cell morphology, rich or scant
thymocytes, cellular atypia, and invasiveness. Due to the
rarity of thymic epithelial tumors, the etiological factors
that contribute to the development of thymomas remain
unclear.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
the histological classification of thymic epithelial tumors is
subdivided into type A thymomas, type B thymomas, type
AB mixed, and type C (or thymic carcinoma) [20]. The

The thymus is an organ that provides a specialized
microenvironment for the thymocyte development. The
thymic microenvironment consists of a variety of cell
types, including the thymic epithelial cells (TECs). TECs
can be further anatomically sub-categorized as cortical
TECs (cTECs) and medullary TECs (mTECs). cTECs
are essential for the positive selection of developing
thymocytes, while mTECs establish self-tolerance of
selected thymocytes [1]. cTECs and mTECs can be
distinguished by differentially expressed cytokeratin
profiles in the adult human thymus [2]. In mice,
cytokeratin 8 (K8) and cytokeratin 5 (K5) are also
commonly used for histological examination of TEC
populations in the cortex and medulla of the postnatal
thymus [3-6]. In addition, mTECs express p63 [6, 7],

homeostasis, we generated an inducible transgenic
mouse named K5-∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2, which expresses
the C-terminal portion of β-catenin fused to a mutated
ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ERT2)
to control activation of β-catenin in K5-expressing cells
using tamoxifen (Tam). Our results with this transgenic
line show that ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2 can be induced by
Tam treatment in both TECs and hair follicles. Very
importantly, we observed that nuclear localization of
β-catenin in TECs promoted thymoma progression. These
results indicate that β-catenin is critical for maintaining
thymic epithelial homeostasis and driving thymoma
progression.

type A thymoma is comprised of spindle or oval neoplastic
cells with few or no lymphocytes. Type B thymoma has
predominantly large polygonal or round epithelial cells.
Type B thymomas can be further subdivided into types
B1, B2, or B3 based on the morphology of neoplastic
epithelial cells and the extent of lymphocytic infiltration.
The type B1 thymoma is a lymphocyte-rich tumor, and
the type B2 thymoma exhibits an increased number of
clustered or scattered neoplastic epithelial cells among
a large population of infiltrated lymphocytes. The type
B3 thymoma is composed of predominantly epithelial
cells with few or no lymphocytes. In addition, an unique
perivascular space pattern is commonly present in the
types B2 and B3 thymomas. Type AB mixed thymoma is
similar to type A thymoma with lymphocyte-rich areas.
Type C thymoma (or thymic carcinoma) is a rare tumor
type that displays higher invasiveness and metastatic
potential [18]. The WHO classification system appears to
reflect the oncogenic potential of thymomas and correlates
with the clinical stages of patients with thymoma [21,
22]; however, the small number of cases has impeded
the ability to establish statistical significance between the
WHO histological typing system and clinical outcomes
[23]. Therefore, further studies on the biological behavior,
histopathological features, prognosis, therapeutic
strategies, and follow-up information of thymomas are
highly warranted.
Previous molecular genetic studies have identified
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC) locus was associated with the type B thymomas
[24, 25]. The critical role of APC-mediated signaling in
thymic epithelial differentiation and carcinogenesis was
further explored in mice by conditional ablation of the
Apc gene using K14-Cre [26]. Interestingly, loss of Apc
in K14-expressing TECs caused thymic atrophy and
squamous metaplasia, suggesting that Apc is required for
thymic epithelial differentiation and development [26].
APC is known to play a key role in regulating stability
and nuclear entry of β-catenin, which is a crucial mediator
of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway involved in cellfate determination, proliferation, embryonic development,
and cancer progression [27]. Forced expression of
stabilized β-catenin in embryonic Foxn1-expressing
thymic epithelial primordium leads to the loss of thymic
epithelial identities and transdifferentiates into epidermal
cell-fate [28]. However, the thymoma phenotype was not
described in either study [26, 28]. Defects in early thymic
organogenesis likely preclude the long-term monitoring of
thymoma development.
In our previous study, we demonstrated that loss
of β-catenin in a K5-expressing TEC lineage resulted in
thymic atrophy [6]. Loss of β-catenin leads to aberrant
differentiation of TECs and subsequent thymocyte
development defects [6]. Thus, β-catenin levels may
be critical for the physiological and pathological states
of TECs. To examine the role of β-catenin in thymic

Characterization of transgenic mice expressing
∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 driven by bovine K5 promoter
in the thymus and skin
To address the function of stabilized β-catenin in
the thymic epithelium of adult mice, K5-∆N64Ctnnb1/
ERT2 mice were generated. These mice harbor an
N-terminal, 64-amino-acid truncation of β-catenin
fused to the tamoxifen (Tam)-inducible ligand-binding
domain of estrogen receptor (ERT2) driven by a bovine K5
promoter (Figure 1A). The expression of ∆N64Ctnnb1/
ERT2 in various organs of transgenic mouse lines 1, 4,
and 10 (hereafter referred to Tg1, Tg4, and Tg10) were
detected using an anti-β-Catenin antibody for western
blot analysis. We found that Tg1 and Tg4 exhibited
comparable amounts of the ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2 fusion
protein in the skin, whereas skin from Tg10 expressed
lower levels of ∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 fusion protein (Figure
1B). In the thymus and the esophagus, we observed
higher ∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 protein levels in the Tg1
mice than in Tg4 or Tg10 mice (Figure 1B). In general,
∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 expression of Tg10 was lowest
among three transgenic lines (Figure 1B). We further
examined transgene copy numbers of Tg1 and Tg4 mice
using southern blot analysis. We found that Tg1 and Tg4
carried about 8 and 4 copies of the transgene, respectively
(Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, Tg1 and Tg4, which
had higher transgene expression, were selected for more
detailed characterization.
Furthermore, we characterized ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2
expression and activation in the TECs of the Tg1 mice
at 8 weeks of age. After 3 days of Tam administration,
thymi were collected and TECs were sorted. Within
CD45-EpCAM+ gated TECs, mTECs and cTECs were
analyzed and sorted using cell surface markers UEA1
and Ly51, respectively (Supplementary Figure 2A).
We found that the percentages of mTECs (UEA1+) and
cTECs (Ly51+) in CD45-EpCAM+ gated cells were

comparable between non-transgenic control (non-Tg) and
Tg1 thymi (Supplementary Figure 2B). Using RT-qPCR,
we found that ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2 expression detected by
the transgene-specific primers (Myc-NLS or ERT2) was
significantly enriched in CD45-EpCAM+UEA1+ mTECs
(Figure 1C). As expected, the mTEC-specific genes, K5
and Aire, and cTEC-specific β5t were enriched in the
CD45-EpCAM+UEA1+ mTECs and CD45-EpCAM+Ly51+
cTECs, respectively (Figure 1C). In consistent with the
transgene expression, we also found that Wnt/β-catenintargeted genes, such as Axin2, cyclin D1, and c-Myc,
were significantly upregulated in the mTECs, but not in
the cTECs, of Tam-treated Tg1 mice (Figure 1D). These
data suggest that the ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2 transgene, driven
by K5 promoter, is restricted and can be induced by Tam
to activate its target genes in mTECs.
Next, we examined several potential phenotypes of
TECs using histology and K5/K8 co-immunofluorescence
analyses in the presence or absence of Tam administration
to 8-week-old Tg1 and Tg4 mice. Microscopically, we
found a few small lesions with squamoid appearance
and rare lymphocytes in the thymic cortical-medullary
junction (CMJ) of vehicle-treated Tg1 mice. These lesions
were expanded in the Tam-treated Tg1 thymic CMJ and
medulla (Figure 1E, middle). However, we found no overt
phenotype in the histological views of thymic medullae
from vehicle only (oil-treated) or Tam-treated Tg4 or nonTg control mice (Figure 1E). We performed K5/K8 coimmunostaining on the thymic sections of non-Tg control,
Tg1, and Tg4 mice after vehicle or Tam treatment for 3 or
28 days. In the non-Tg control, we observed K5- and K8expressing cells predominately in the medulla and cortex,
respectively (Figure 1E). In the vehicle-treated Tg1 mice,
aberrant K5-expressing cell clusters residing in the CMJ of
the thymi were observed (Figure 1F), indicating possible
leaky expression of -catenin, leading to sufficient activity
to drive thymoma initiation. However, in the vehicletreated Tg4 mice, the aberrant K5-expressing cell clusters
were not detected (Figure 1F). After Tam treatment for
3 days or 28 days in Tg1 and Tg4 mice, expanded K5expressing squamoid cells were observed, although the
aberrantly expanded K5-expressing lesions were smaller
in the thymi of Tg4 (Figure 1F). This observation may be
due to lower ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2 transgene expression in
the thymus as seen by western blot (Figure 1B).
Next, we examined ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2 expression
in hair cycle re-entry because previous studies have
demonstrated that transient β-catenin activation in the skin
results in stimulation of resting (telogen) hair follicles to
the growing state (anagen phase) [29, 30]. Therefore, we
applied Tam topically on the back skin of Tg1 and Tg4
mice and examined hair cycle re-entry. In agreement with
these reports [29, 30], we observed that hair follicles
had grown into deeper layers of the dermis, with marked
expansion of outer root sheet (ORS) cells, in Tg1 and Tg4
mice that received Tam compared to those that received

vehicle (EtOH) only (Supplementary Figure 3A). We also
examined potential leakage activation of ΔN64Ctnnb1/
ERT2 fusion protein in the absence of Tam. We observed
darker skin, indicating hair follicles in growing state, on
the back skin of shaved Tg1 and Tg4 mice compared to
non-Tg controls without Tam treatment for 16-20 days
(Supplemental Figure 3B), suggesting possible leaky
expression and activity of β-catenin. Taken together, our
data suggest that ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2 can be induced by
Tam treatment in both TECs and hair follicles in Tg mice,
although leaky expression of active ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2
may be present.

Monitoring thymomas in leakage activation of
β-catenin in K5-expressing TECs in the aged
transgenic mice
Because leaky expression of active ΔN64Ctnnb1/
ERT2 occurred in our established Tg mice, we monitored
spontaneous tumor progression, which might be caused
by the activation of β-catenin in the absence of Tam. We
found manifest thymic tumors specifically in Tg1 and Tg4
mice but not in the non-Tg littermates (Figure 2A and 2B).
The tumor incidence in Tg1 mice increased from 23.6%
(2 of 7 mice) at 10 months old to 63.7% (12 of 18 mice)
at 12 months old (Figure 2A). Also, one of five Tg4 mice
developed manifest thymomas at late onset (18 months)
(Figure 2B). The low incidence of thymoma development
in Tg4 mice might reflect the lower expression of
∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 in the Tg4 thymus overall (Figure 1B).
These data suggest that a leaky expression of activated
β-catenin cause thymoma development in the Tg1 and Tg4
mice without Tam treatment.
We analyzed the thymoma phenotype in Tg1 mice
and their non-Tg littermates at 2 months and 6 months
of age. Although we could not observed manifest tumors
in Tg1 thymi at 2 or 6 months, we observed microscopic
thymoma lesions embedded in the CMJ of all Tg1 thymi
(n = 4) at 2 months or formed an epithelial sheet in the
medullary area of all Tg1 thymi (n = 7) at 6 months (2 and
6 months; Figure 2C). At 10 or 12 months, we found that
the manifest thymic tumors of Tg1 mice were composed
of polygonal epithelial cells with a squamoid appearance
and scant lymphocytes (Figure 2C). Notably, perivascular
spaces with loose connective tissues appeared between
vessels and neoplastic epithelial sheets (10 and 12 months;
Figure 2C), resembling the histology characteristics
of type B3 thymoma, or atypical thymoma, in humans.
Using immunofluorescence staining for K5 and K8, we
showed that the early thymoma lesions expressed K5,
but not K8 (2 months; Figure 2D). The K5-expressing
lesions accumulated and formed a sheet-like pattern at 6
months that seemed to correspond to the pre-lesions of
Tg1 thymomas at 10 and 12 months (Figure 2D). These
K5-expressing lesions in Tg1 thymi at 6 months of age

were comparable to the features of short-term (3 days
and 28 days) Tam-induced early lesions in the thymi of
Tam-treated Tg1 mice (Figure 2D versus Figure 1F).
Moreover, Tg4 tumors identified at 18 months exhibited
similar histological features and K5 expression as those
seen in Tg1 tumors at 10-12 months, indicating that lower
transgenic β-catenin activation correlates with slower
thymoma progression (Figure 2C and 2D).
In addition, we performed flow cytometry to detect
CD45-EpCAM+ gated UEA1+Ly51- mTECs and UEA1Ly51+ cTECs in non-Tg thymi and Tg1 thymomas. In
the non-Tg thymi, UEA1+Ly51- subset was reduced
(approximately 2.5-fold) and UEA1+Ly51+ population
was increased (approximately 3.5-fold) in 12-monthold mice compared to those subsets from 6-month-old
mice (Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B), suggesting the
changes of TEC subsets are associated with age. In the
Tg1 thymi at 6 months old, all TEC subsets in CD45EpCAM+ cells were comparable to those in non-Tg thymi
(Supplementary Figure 4A & 4B). In the thymomas from
12-month-old Tg1 mice, we found that the collagenase
could not completely dissociate the tumor fragments,
resulting in a collagenase resistant portion (C-res) that
could be subsequently dissociated by trypsin. Interestingly,
the collagenase-dissociated and C-res subsets in the
Tg1 thymomas were composed of higher percentage of
UEA1+Ly51- subset and lower percentage of UEA1+Ly51+
population compared to the TEC subsets of thymi from
12-month-old non-Tg mice (Supplementary Figure 4A &
4B). Percentages of UEA1-Ly51+ subsets were comparable
in non-Tg thymi and Tg1 thymoma (Supplementary
Figure 4B). Therefore, it is possible that the sustained K5+
and UEA1+Ly51- subsets in Tg1 thymomas arising from
the mTECs, where the ∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 transgene was
expressed, maintained the differentiation characteristics of
mTECs during thymoma progression.

in the manifest thymomas compared to the CD45- thymic
stromal cells isolated from non-Tg thymi (Figure 3C).
Nuclear localization of β-catenin was also observed and
significantly increased in the early lesions and manifest
thymomas of Tg1 mice at 6 and 12 months of age (Figure
3D and 3E). These data suggest that canonical Wnt/βcatenin signaling is activated in thymomas and drives their
progression.

Compensation of endogenous β-catenin loss by
∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 transgene for maintaining
thymic homeostasis
Previously, we have taken a loss-of-function
approach to conditionally ablate β-catenin and demonstrate
that β-catenin expression in TECs is intrinsically required
for TEC differentiation, thereby affecting thymocyte
development and resulting in thymic atrophy [6]. In this
study, we examined whether Tg1 mice exhibited leaky
β-catenin activity, which might be able to compensate
for the conditional ablation of β-catenin in K5-expressing
TECs and cause thymic atrophy. Thus, we bred the
Tg1 mice to the previously established Ctnnb1K5-fx/fx
background to obtain Tg1;Ctnnb1K5-fx/fx mice. After 10 days
of 4-OH-Tam (4-OHT) treatment, the size, cellularity, and
CD4/CD8 distributions of Tg1;Ctnnb1K5-fx/fx adult thymi
were similar to those of thymi from control animals
(Figure 4A-4C). These data suggest that the expression
of constitutively active β-catenin in Tg1 mice is sufficient
to rescue Ctnnb1K5-fx/fx thymic atrophy. Furthermore, the
Ctnnb1K5-fx/fx thymic phenotype, including the decreased
frequency of proliferating thymocytes (total, CD4-CD8DN and CD4+CD8+DP; Figure 4D) and the increased
percentage of annexin V-labeled apoptotic cells (total and
CD4+CD8+DP; Figure 4E), was significantly reversed by
the transgenic expression of stabilized β-catenin in K5expressing cells. Our data suggest that expression of the
∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 fusion protein in TECs can functionally
complement the effects of β-catenin loss in the K5expressing TEC lineage. This genetic complementation
experiment also suggests that the ∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2
fusion protein in TECs can compensate endogenous
β-catenin function.

Activated Wnt/β-catenin canonical pathway in the
mouse thymomas
To examine whether the Wnt/β-catenin canonical
pathway is activated in ∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 thymomas in the
absence of Tam, we introduced the TOP-Gal transgene to
allow the measurement of Wnt/β-catenin activation. Using
whole-mount X-gal staining, we found that Tg1;TOP-Gal
thymi clearly exhibited patched blue staining compared
to negatively stained non-Tg littermate (TOP-Gal)
thymi at 6 months (Figure 3A). Immunohistochemistry
also revealed that the β-galactosidase was specifically
detected in Tg1;TOP-Gal thymic medullae, but not in the
non-Tg control (Figure 3B). We next examined several
targeted genes of Wnt/β-catenin canonical pathway,
which should be activated if the ∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2
transgene is functional during thymoma progression.
Indeed, Axin2, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc were upregulated

Aberrant expression of AIRE and p63 in mouse
thymomas is similar to that in human thymomas
The loss of AIRE [31] expression and intense p63
[32-34] expression have been reported in human thymomas
and thymic carcinomas. Therefore, we determined the
expression of AIRE and p63 in Tg1 thymoma samples
and non-Tg thymi using co-immunofluorescence. We
found that AIRE was undetectable in K5-expressing
tumor cells of early thymoma lesions (2 or 6 months of
age) or manifest thymomas of mice 10-12 months of age

(Figure 5A). Comparatively, scattered AIRE expression
was detected in medullary K5-expressing cells of the nonTg thymi at the corresponding time points (Figure 5A).
In contrast, p63 showed intense homogenous expression
in the K5-expressing tumor cells of both early thymoma
lesions and manifest thymomas compared to the scattered
p63 expression in K5-expressing cells of the non-Tg
thymi (Figure 5B). Similar expression patterns of AIRE
and p63 were also observed in a Tg4 thymoma at 18
months (Figure 5A and 5B). Interestingly, loss of AIRE
and presence of p63 were observed in Tg1 thymomas

with leaky β-catenin activation without Tam treatment,
but these expression patterns were also found in a shortterm (3 days) treatment of Tam in Tg1 microscopic lesions
(Supplementary Figure 5).
Next, we examined p63 transcripts in the manifest
thymoma samples (n = 3) of Tg1 mice and purified
CD45- thymic stromal cells of non-Tg mice (n = 3)

two alternative promoters, producing TAp63 and ∆Np63

primer sets to determine which p63 isoforms were
expressed. Our results showed that ∆Np63, but not
TAp63, was increased in the manifest thymoma samples
compared to the non-Tg thymic stromal cells (Figure
5C). Furthermore, the spicing variants ∆Np63-α and -β,
but not -γ, were upregulated in the manifest thymoma
samples, suggesting that ∆Np63-α and -β were the major
p63 isoforms involved with increased expression, which
may contribute to tumorigenesis of TECs. Furthermore,
one potential target gene of p53/p63 is p21WAF1/cip1, which
can be suppressed by increasing levels of ∆Np63 isoforms
[36-39]. We found that p21 transcript was significantly
decreased in Tg1 thymomas compared to non-Tg
CD45- thymic stromal cells (Figure 5C), a finding that is
consistent with p21 downregulation in human thymomas
[40].

for K10 expression (Figure 6C) and scattered positive for
loricrin expression (Figure 6D) in manifest thymomas
from 12-month-old Tg1 mice. The heterogenously
expressed K10 and loricrin indicated aberrant squamoid
cell-fate differentiation in some neoplastic cells of Tg1
thymomas.

Discussion
In this study, the transgenic mice expressing
ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2 under the control of K5 promoter
enable us to monitor thymoma progression from early
lesions to manifest thymomas. These thymomas have
histological and molecular characteristics that resemble
those of type B3 thymomas in humans. Our findings also
suggest that induced β-catenin activation is sufficient to
drive thymoma initiation, forming microscopic lesions.
Loss of AIRE expression and gain of ∆Np63-α and -β
isoform expression in the microscopic lesions, as well as
in the manifest thymomas, appear to be common features
between this mouse model and human thymomas [31-34].
Interestingly, thymomas developed in the Tg1 mice also
express β5t, which is a differential diagnostic marker for
type B3 thymomas in humans [43, 44]. Both K10 and
loricrin were focally expressed in some neoplastic cells
in Tg1 thymomas, suggesting that over-expression of
the ∆N64Ctnnb1/ERT2 fusion protein in TECs may adopt
squamous cell-fate differentiation.
Although the molecular genetics of human
thymomas are largely unclear, the presence of APC
mutations has been linked to pathogenesis of type B3
thymomas [47]. Also, LOH at APC locus has been found
in the type B thymomas [24, 25]. These reports implicate
the possible link of APC-controlled β-catenin activation
in human thymomas. Previously, Apc conditional ablation
by K14-Cre mice showed aberrant growth of epidermalderived organs and squamous metaplasia in the thymus
[26]. However, these Apc-conditional knock-out mice
(K14-Cre;ApcCKO/CKO) die before weaning, thus precluding
follow-up studies to monitor thymic homeostasis and
thymoma development. In our study, the transgenic mice
expressing the ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2 fusion protein exhibited
leaky β-catenin activation in K5-expressing cells, but this
phenotype did not lead to early lethality, thus enabling
us to monitor thymoma development as the transgenic
animals aged. Induction with tamoxifen initiated thymoma
lesions in a temporally control manner, enabling us to
examine molecular changes in the early stages of thymoma
progression. The thymomas that developed in the Tg1 and
Tg4 mice reflect the expression levels of the ΔN64Ctnnb1/
ERT2 transgene and share histological appearance (e.g.
cellular atypia and perivascular space) and expression
patterns of cellular markers (AIRE, p63, p21 and β5t)
with those of human thymomas. Therefore, these findings
suggest that the β-catenin activation is possible to drive
thymoma pathogenesis.

Aberrant expression of β5t and squamoid
differentiation markers in the mouse thymomas
β5t is a cTEC-specific proteosomal subunit [41,
42] that has recently been used as a differential diagnosis
marker of type B3 thymomas [43, 44]. To gain insight
into the phenotypes of mouse thymomas developed in
Tg1 mice, we examined the expression of β5t in Tg1
thymomas during initiation and progression. Using
immunohistochemistry, we detected β5t in the cortical area
in control thymi of Tg1 mice aged 2 to 12 months (Figure
6A). In 2-month-old Tg1 thymi, β5t was expressed in the
cortical area similarly to non-Tg thymi and was weakly
detected in focal microscopic lesions in medullary area
(Figure 6A). As thymoma development proceeded, robust
β5t expression was detected in most neoplastic cells from
thymomas of 6- to 12-month-old Tg1 mice (Figure 6A).
These findings suggest that β5t expression increased with
age in Tg1 thymomas. This characteristic resembles that
of type B3 thymomas in humans [43, 44]. Furthermore,
we examined β5t and β-catenin expression in the early
lesions in the thymi of Tg1 mice at 6 months of age and in
manifest thymomas of Tg1 mice at 10-12 months of age.
We found that the nuclear form of β-catenin and uniform
expression of β5t were markedly increased in manifest at
12-month-old thymomas compared with that of the early
lesions at 6 months of age (Figure 6B). Thus, transgenic
mice expressing stabilized β-catenin in TECs exhibit
thymoma development and molecular characteristics, such
as β5t, that resemble that of type B3 thymomas in humans.
While previous studies showed that Apc loss
or β-catenin stabilization in TECs caused squamous
metaplasia in the developing thymus [26, 28], no thymoma
phenotype was reported. To characterize TECs-derived
thymomas in Tg1 mice, the expression of squamoid
differentiation markers K10 and loricrin [45, 46] were
used in immunohistochemistry. We found focal positive

Genetically engineered mouse models are extremely
valuable for the modeling of human diseases because
they enable us to validate causative mediators using both
loss- and gain-of-function approaches. Diseases such
as thymoma, which have various clinically unsolved
problems, are difficult to tackle because of the rarity of
clinical cases reported. Previously, SV40 T-antigen, driven
by its own viral early region elements, which include
an enhancer and a promoter, caused thymic epithelial
carcinomas in transgenic mice [48]. Additionally, forced
expression of the E6/E7 oncogene driven by the K5
promoter caused thymic epithelial tumors in the transgenic
mice [49]. These viral oncogenes are commonly used for
transgenic studies to block p53 or Rb checkpoints in the
cell cycle, leading to tumorigenesis [50]. In addition,
overexpression of E2F2, which is a E2F member and
downstream target of Rb, alters cell cycle progression
[51] in transgenic mice, causing a high incidence of
thymomas [52]. These transgenic mouse models suggest
that dysregulated cell cycle control can be the critical

determinant for thymoma development. Consistently,
the levels of cell cycle regulators p21, p27, and p53 have
been examined in encapsulated thymomas in a clinical
study [40]. Increased p53 and decreased p21 and p27
in thymoma tissue correlated with poor prognosis for
shorter disease-free survival [40], suggesting that aberrant
regulation of cell-cycle progression contributes to the
clinical outcomes of the patients with thymomas. In this
study, we also demonstrated downregulated p21, which
was coincidently associated with upregulated ∆Np63-α
and -β isoforms, which may work together to promote
TECs tumorigenesis.
In summary, our study provides data to generate
a fundamental basis for understanding the activation
of β-catenin in the progression of thymic epithelial
carcinogenesis. In the future, our mouse models may be
used as the in vivo platforms for validating the therapeutic
agents and strategies to treat the thymomas.

Materials and methods

Western blot assay
Generally, the experimental procedures of western
blot assay were completed as described previously [56].
Primary antibodies against β-catenin (mouse IgG. 1:1000;
BD Bioscience) and GAPDH (mouse IgG, 1:2000; Santa
Cruz) were used for these analyses.

Mice and genotyping
Tg(K5-ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2) transgenic mouse lines
Tg1, Tg4, and Tg10 were generated on the C57BL/6
background for this study. The K5-ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2
transgenic plasmid (Figure 1A) was composed of the
bovine keratin 5 promoter (derived from BK5-Cre
plasmid, which was kindly provided by Dr. José L.
Jorcano), a rabbit β-globulin intron sequence (IVS), a
Myc-tagged sequence, two copies of a nuclear location
signal (NLS), a portion of the Ctnnb1 encoding N-terminal
64-amino acid deletion mutant of β-catenin, the mutated
ligand-binding domain of human estrogen receptor (ERT2)
gene (derived from Cre-ERT2 plasmid, which was kindly
provided by Dr. Pierre Chambon, IGBMC, France), an
SV40 polyadenylation signal (pA), and two copies of the
HS4 insulators. The 11.4-kb NotI/SalI-digested transgene
fragment was eluted and separated from the pBluescript
vector backbone for pronuclear microinjection. TOPGal transgenic mice [53] were obtained from the
RIKEN biological resource center (Experimental Animal
Division, RIKEN BRC, Ibaraki, Japan), and then bred
with Tg1 to generate Tg1;TOP-Gal mice. Ctnnb1K5-fx/
fx
mice carrying the BK5-CreERT transgene [54] and the
Ctnnb1 conditional allele [55] were described previously
[6]. Tg1;Ctnnb1K5-fx/fx mice were generated by crossing
Ctnnb1K5-fx/+ with Tg1;Ctnnb1fx/+ mice. Allelic specific
genotyping was conducted by PCR methodology. The
Tg(K5-ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2) transgene was detected using
the Myc-tag forward primer (5’-gct cat ttc tga aga gga ctt
g-3’) and Ctnnb1 reverse primer (5’-gct cag gaa ttg cac
gtg tgg-3’), yielding a 400-bp PCR product. The TOP-Gal
transgene was detected with forward primer (5’-ttg ccg tct
gaa ttt gac ctg-3’) and reverse primer (5’-tct gct tca atc agc
gtg cc-3’), yielding a 500-bp PCR product. Genotyping
of Ctnnb1K5-fx/fx mice was described previously [6]. All
experiments with mice were performed with the approval
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) at National Yang-Ming University.

Flow cytometry and sorting of TECs
Experimental procedure was performed as described
previously [6]. Briefly, the thymic fragments dissected
from non-Tg and Tg mice were treated with collagenase (1
mg/mL collagenase D; Sigma) and DNase I (0.1 mg/mL;
Sigma) at 37oC for 15 minutes. Subsequently, collagenase
D activity was terminated by adding phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) containing 1% FBS and 0.5 mM EDTA. In
addition, the portion of Tg1 thymomas that could not be
completely dissociated by collagenase was collected and
subsequently treated with Trypsin (0.05%)-EDTA(0.02%)
(Invitrogen) for preparing the single cell suspension.
Finally, the cell suspension were washed with PBS and
then stained with APC-congujated anti-CD45 antibody
(1:200; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), PE/Cy7conjugated anti-EpCAM antibody (1:400; eBiocience, San
Diego, CA, USA), Rhodamine-conjugated UEA1 (1:50;
Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and FITCconjugated anti-Ly51 antibody (1:400; Biolegend) for the
following flow cytometry analysis by BD FACScalibur
(BD Biosciences). For cell sorting experiment, the UEA1+
and Ly51+ subsets were gated and sorted from CD45EpCAM+ TEC populations by a BD FACSAria cell sorter
(BD Biosciences).

Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)
Detailed experimental procedures were described
previously [6]. Expression of ΔN64Ctnnb1/ERT2 was
detected by the transgene-specific Myc-NLS primers (5’GAG CAA AAG CTC ATT TCT GAA-3’and 5’-TAC TTG
CTC TTG CGT GAA GG-3’) or ERT2 primers (5’-CTT
GCT CTT GGA CAG GAA CC-3’ and 5’-CGA GAT GAT
GTA GCC AGC AG-3’). Expression of K5 was detected
using primers 5’- ACA GGA AGC TGC TGG AGG GC3’ and 5’-GGT GGA GAC AAA TTT GAC ACT GG-3’.
Expression of Aire was detected using primers 5’-GGT
TCC TCC CCT TCC ATC-3’ and 5’-GGC ACA CTC
ATC CTC GTT CT-3’. Expression of β5t was detected by
primers 5’-GCT GTA TAG GGA GCT GCA GAA -3’ and
5’-TGG CAG GCT CAG GAT AGA TT-3’. Expression
of Axin2 was detected using primers 5’-ctg ctg gtc agg
cag gag-3’ and 5’-tgc cag ttt ctt tgg ctc tt-3’. Expression
of Ccnd1 was determined using the primers 5’-ctg gcc
atg aac tac ctg ga-3’ and 5’-gtc aca ctt gat cac tct gg-3’.

Tamoxifen administration
Tamoxifen (Tam) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) was dissolved in 100% ethanol (10 mg/ml) and
then mixed in sunflower seed oil (oil; Sigma-Aldrich)
before intraperitoneal injection. Mice at 8 weeks of age
were injected with Tam (0.5 mg in 100 μl oil) or vehicle
(oil) only for 5 consecutive days. 4-OH-Tam (4-OHT) was
dissolved in DMSO and then emulsified in oil as described
previously [6, 54, 56]. Mice at the 8 weeks of age were
injected intraperitoneally with three doses of 4-OHT (0.1
mg in 250 μl oil) every other day.
