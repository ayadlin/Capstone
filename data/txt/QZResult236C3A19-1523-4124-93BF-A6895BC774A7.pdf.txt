Abstract
Anticancer agents act, at least in part, by inducing reactive
oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). We examined the redox
effect on SW480 and HT-29 colon cancer cells of four
anticancer compounds, arsenic trioxide, phosphoaspirin,
phosphosulindac, and nitric oxide–donating aspirin (NOASA). All compounds inhibited the growth of both cell lines
(IC50, 10–90 Mmol/L) and induced RONS detected by a general
RONS molecular probe. NO-ASA, which induced at least four
individual RONS (NO, H2O2, superoxide anion, and peroxynitirte), induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death that was
RONS-mediated (cell death paralleled RONS levels and was
abrogated by N-acetyl cysteine but not by diphenylene
iodonium, which displayed prooxidant activity and enhanced
cell death). Nuclear factor-KB and mitogen-activated protein
kinases were modulated by RONS. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), an
oxidoreductase involved in redox regulation, was heavily
oxidized in response to RONS and mediated the growth
inhibitory effect of the anticancer agents; knocking-down
trx-1 expression by small interfering RNA abrogated cell death
induced by them. These compounds also inhibited the activity
of Trx reductase that reduces oxidized Trx-1, whereas the Trx
reductase inhibitor aurothiomalate synergized with NO-ASA
in the induction of cell death. Our findings indicate that the
Trx system mediates to a large extent redox-induced cell death
in response to anticancer agents. This mechanism of action
may be shared by more anticancer agents and deserves further
assessment as a candidate mechanism for the pharmacologic
control of cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8269–77]

Introduction
Thioredoxin (Trx) is an a oxidoreductase involved in redox
regulation and cell signaling (1–4). Trx is a member of the Trx
system that also includes Trx reductase (TrxR) and NADPH. The
ubiquitously expressed Trx system and glutathione (GSH) are the
two main antioxidant systems that reduce thiol (-SH) groups.
Three distinct forms of Trx have been identified: the 12-kDa
cytosolic Trx-1; Trx-2, the mitochondrial isoform; and SpTrx,
which is highly expressed in spermatozoa. Trx-1 acts as an
intracellular reductase using two vicinal cysteine residues (Cys32

and Cys35) at its conserved active site (-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-). The
redox-active center of reduced Trx-1 interacts with the oxidized
protein that it is about to reduce, which has a disulfide bond
(S-S; ref. 1). Trx-1 reduces the target protein by converting its
disulfide bond to two-SH groups, whereas, in the process, Trx-1
itself becomes oxidized, with its two -SH groups forming a
disulfide. TrxR and NADPH reduce Trx-1 back to its original state.
Trx-1 has three additional cysteines, Cys62, Cys69, and Cys73.
Further oxidation of Trx-1 first leads to the formation of a
disulfide bond between Cys62 and Cys69 and, next, to a disulfide
bond between Cys73 of two different Trx-1 molecules, which
ultimately leads to the formation of a dimer.
Numerous proteins are redox-regulated by the Trx system (5).
Examples of such regulation include the reduction by Trx-1 of a
cysteinyl residue of the p50 subunit of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB),
which is required for its DNA binding, and the activation through
similar reduction reactions of many transcription factors. Trxs,
implicated in a number of diseases (2, 3), seem to play a vital role in
cancer biology and in cancer response to chemotherapeutic agents.
Trx, overexpressed in pancreas, colon, lung, and other cancers,
suppresses apoptosis by activating the Akt pathway or through the
apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1; ref. 6).
In recent years, it has become clear that anticancer agents act, at
least in part, by inducing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
(RONS). At low concentrations, RONS seem to protect the cell,
whereas at higher concentrations, they can damage many
biological molecules, such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, and may
initiate cell death (7). Among the anticancer compounds that
generate RONS is nitric oxide–donating aspirin (NO-ASA), a
promising chemopreventive agent (8). NO-ASA generates a state
of oxidative stress through which it affects redox-sensitive signaling
pathways, leading ultimately to the elimination of the neoplastic
cell via apoptosis or necrosis (9).
Given the apparent importance of RONS in the mechanism of
action of these compounds, we studied this phenomenon in
human colon cancer cell lines. Whereas we have focused on
NO-ASA, we have also included in our study phosphoaspirin, a
structurally similar anticancer derivative of aspirin, which is
devoid of the NO-releasing moiety (10), phosphosulindac, a
derivative of sulindac, that is also chemopreventive against colon
cancer,1 and arsenic trioxide (As2O3), an agent that is highly
effective in acute promyelocytic leukemia (11). Here, we present
results demonstrating that these anticancer agents induce
oxidative stress leading to apoptosis and necrosis and
that the Trx system plays a key role in the induction of cell
death by them.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and Culture Media
McCoy’s 5a medium (modified), MEM (Eagle), RPMI 1640, and antibiotics
were from Fisher-Mediatech. FCS was from Hyclone. NO-ASA [2-(acetyloxy)
benzoic acid 4-(nitrooxymethyl)-phenyl ester], phosphoaspirin [2-(acetyloxy) benzoic acid 4-(diethylphospho)-phenyl ester], and phosphosulindac
were a gift from Chemi-Master International (East Setauket, NY; ref. 12).
Dihydroethidium and 2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescine diacetate (DCFDA) were
from Calbiochem. Dihydrorhodamine, MitoSOX Red, Annexin V, and
propidium iodide (PI) were from Invitrogen. Anti–mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK) antibodies were from Cell Signaling, anti-ASK1
was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibodies to Trx-1 and TrxR were
from Abcam. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), aurothiomalate (ATM), and all other
reagents were from Sigma Chemical.

Cell Culture and Cell Viability Assays
The HT-29 and SW480 human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines
were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells, grown
as recommended by ATCC, were seeded at 5  104 cells/cm2 and allowed
to attach for 24 h, followed by various treatments, as indicated. Cell
viability was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay following the protocol of the manufacturer
(Roche Diagnostics).

Cell Death Assays
PI incorporation assay. Cells were seeded in 12-well plates and treated
as indicated. After each treatment, cells were detached using a cell scraper,
fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h, stained with PI (50 Ag/mL) and RNase A
(4 units/mL) for 30 min, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis.
Lactate dehydrogenase assay. After cells were treated with the test
drug for 24 h, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration was determined
in the culture medium using the Cytotoxicity Detection kitPLUS (Roche
Diagnostics).
Annexin V and PI staining. After cells were treated with the test drugs
in 12-well plates, they were trypsinized and stained with Annexin V-FITC
(100 dilution) and PI (0.5 Ag/mL) for 15 min. Annexin V-FITC and PI
fluorescence intensities were analyzed by FACSCaliber (BD Bioscience).
Annexin V (+)/PI ( ) cells are apoptotic cells, Annexin V (+)/PI (+) cells
have undergone secondary necrosis, and Annexin V ( )/PI (+) cells are
necrotic cells.

Determination of RONS
Determination of RONS levels by confocal microscopy. To determine
mitochondrial superoxide anion production, cells were seeded in 35-mm
glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek). After each treatment, cells were
stained with 5 Amol/L MitoSOX Red for 10 min or with 5 Amol/L
dihydrorhodamine for 15 min. Live cells were kept in a 5% CO2 chamber
and examined under a Zeiss LSM510 metaconfocal microscope.
Determination of RONS levels by SpectraMax M5. Cells seeded
in 96-well plates were loaded with either 5 Amol/L DCFDA for 30 min or
5 Amol/L DAF-2 for 30 min or 5 Amol/L Amplex Red for 15 min in plain
RPMI medium and then treated with the test drug as indicated. The
emission for each dye was read by SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices).
In experiments using N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), cells were pretreated with
20 mmol/L NAC for 4 h in complete medium, followed by DCFDA for
30 min in medium without phenol red and serum, and then were treated
with the test drug as indicated.
Determination of RONS by FACSCaliber. After treatment with the test
drug in 12-well plates, cells were trypsinized and stained with 10 Amol/L
DCFDA for 30 min at 37jC and the fluorescence intensity was analyzed by
FACSCaliber (BD Bioscience).

Western Blotting
After each treatment, cells were lysed on ice with 1% Triton X-100
lysis buffer with 2.5 mmol/L 4-nitrophenylphosphate, 1% SDS, and 0.25%
sodium deoxycholate for 30 min. The cell lysate (30 Ag) was loaded onto
SDS-electrophoresis gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

The membrane was then immunoblotted with anti–phosphorylated
p38, anti–phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), or
anti–phosphorylated c-Jun-NH2 kinase (JNK) antibodies followed by
secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used to
visualize the bands on X-ray film.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
After treatment with the test drug, cells were gently scraped into the
medium and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed
on nuclear extracts, as previously described (13). To assay NF-nB binding,
we used a commercially available Gel Shift Assay System (Promega
Corporation).

NF-KB (Human p50) Transcription Factor Assay by ELISA
After treatment with the test drug, cells were gently scraped into the
medium and nuclear extracts were isolated, as previously described (13).
The NF-nB activity was analyzed using an ELISA kit from Panomics.

Assay for ASK1–Trx-1 Complex Formation
Immunoprecipitation of ASK1–Trx-1 complexes was performed using
Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose beads as per the instructions of the
manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Briefly, cells were lysed in
immunoprecipitation assay buffer, and half of each cell lysate was incubated
with 1 mmol/L DTT for 30 min. The lysates were then precleared by adding
40 AL Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose beads and incubating for 30 min at 4jC.
Cell lysates were then incubated with 6 Ag anti–Trx-1 and 40 AL Protein A/
G PLUS-Agarose beads for 4 h at 4jC. The immunoprecipitates were boiled
in 1 electrophoresis sample buffer, and samples were subjected to SDSPAGE analysis.

Trx Redox Status Assay
106cells were lysed in 6 mol/L guanidinium chloride, 50 mmol/L Tris/HCl
(pH 8.3), 3 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.5% Triton-X-100 containing 50 mmol/L
iodoacetic acid (14). After 30 min at 37jC, the excess iodoacetic acid was
removed using Microspin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Oxidized and reduced Trx-1 were separated by native PAGE. The gel was
electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a Trx-1
antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Bands
corresponding to Trx-1 were visualized by ECL.

Trx Gene Silencing by Transfecting Specific Small
Interfering RNA

0.8  105 SW480 cells seeded in 12-well plates were transfected with 100
nmol/L Trx small interfering RNA (siRNA) or nonspecific control siRNA
(Dharmacon) for 72 h using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

Trx Reductase Activity Assay
After treatment with the test drug, cells were lysed and TrxR activity was
determined in the protein lysate using a commercially available kit,
as per the instructions of the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical). In this
assay, TrxR uses NADPH to reduce 5,5¶-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to
5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB).

Results
Anticancer agents induce multiple RONS in colon cancer
cell lines. As expected, all four of the anticancer compounds
studied (structures in Supplementary Fig. S1) inhibited the
growth of SW480 and HT-29 human colon cancer cells. Under
our experimental protocol, the IC50s of growth inhibition after
24 hours of treatment were as follows: (a) NO-ASA: HT-29
cells = 25 F 2.3 Amol/L (mean F SE, for this and all subsequent
values), SW480 cells = 38 F 4.0 Amol/L; (b) phosphoaspirin: HT-29
cells = 39.3 F 2.9 Amol/L, SW480 cells = 90.3 F 2.8 Amol/L; (c)
phosphosulindac: HT-29 cells = 65 F 2.3 Amol/L, SW480 cells =
98 F 4.0 Amol/L; and (d) arsenic trioxide: SW480 cells = 10 F
1.3 Amol/L.

Thioredoxin System Mediates Redox-Induced Cell Death

Figure 1. Anticancer agents induce multiple RONS in colon cancer cell lines. A, HT-29 and SW480 cells were treated with various compounds for 3 h, as indicated,
followed by DCFDA staining for 30 min. The fluorescent intensity of each sample was read by flow cytometry. B, top, HT-29 and SW480 cells were preincubated
with the NO probe, DAF-2, for 30 min, followed by treatment with the test agent for 3 h, when intracellular NO levels were determined by flow cytometry, as in Materials
and Methods. Results are shown as fold increase compared with control cells. Bottom, HT-29 and SW480 cells were preincubated for 15 min with the H2O2 probe
Amplex Red, followed by treatment with each of the test drugs for 3 h, when intracellular H2O2 levels were determined based on their fluorescence as in Materials and
Methods. Results are expressed as fold increase compared with untreated controls. C, HT-29 cells were treated with 50 Amol/L NO-ASA (2  IC50) for 30 min,
followed by 5 Amol/L MitoSox (O.2 probe) for 10 min (top ) or 5 Amol/L dihydrorhodamine (peroxynitrite probe) for 15 min (bottom ). The production of O.2 (top ) and
peroxynitrite (bottom ) was observed using a Zeiss LSM510-meta confocal microscope. In each panel, the top row represents fluorescent images and the bottom row
represents them merged with the corresponding differential interference contrast image. Values are mean F SE.

As shown in Fig. 1, all four compounds induced RONS, as
detected by the general molecular probe DCFDA, which responds
to at least 10 individual reactive species (15, 16). Of note, at
identical multiples of their respective IC50s, sulindac produced
more RONS than phosphosulindac; ASA (5 mmol/L) failed to
induce any RONS, whereas NO-ASA and phosphoaspirin did
(Supplementary Fig. S2). We then investigated the effect of
NO-ASA on the levels of four individual RONS, NO, H2O2, ONOO ,
, and O.2 . After 3 hours of treatment, NO-ASA increased, in both
cell lines, the levels of NO and H2O2 in a concentration-dependent
manner. NO levels were increased 2-fold to 7-fold over control and
H2O2 levels 3.5-fold to 4.5-fold over control. Imaging by confocal
microscopy showed that NO-ASA promoted O 2. and
ONOO formation in mitochondria as early as 30 minutes after
they were exposed to NO-ASA.
NO-ASA induces RONS-dependent cell death. The two cell
lines, SW480 and HT-29, responded to NO-ASA in a similar manner.

www.aacrjournals.org

As shown in Fig. 2A, NO-ASA induced colon cancer cell death, both
by apoptosis and necrosis. The induction of apoptosis by NO-ASA
was greatest at the 1IC50 concentration, when 20% of SW480 cells
and 16% of HT-29 cells were apoptotic, diminishing progressively
as the concentrations of NO-ASA increased further. The induction
of necrosis showed a steady increase in response to increasing
concentrations of NO-ASA; at 4  IC50, the highest NO-ASA
concentration studied, 74% and 53% of SW480 and HT-29 cells,
respectively, were necrotic.
RONS are known to induce cell death in various cancer cell lines
(7, 17). On the other hand, RONS can be produced during cell death
(18). To distinguish whether the cell death induced by NO-ASA was
RONS-dependent or whether RONS production was the result of
cell death, we used two antioxidants, NAC and diphenylene
iodonium (DPI; refs. 19–22). However, the results obtained with
these two compounds were different. As seen in Fig. 2B, after
treatment with NO-ASA for 16 hours, 20 mmol/L NAC blocked cell

Figure 2. NO-ASA induces oxidative stress-dependent cell death. A, SW480 and HT-29 cells were treated with various concentrations of NO-ASA for 24 h, and
cells were collected for apoptotic or necrotic cell death analysis. PI incorporation, determined by flow cytometry, was used to detect apoptotic cell death (sub-G1
population in DNA histograms; left ). LDH assay from cultured supernatants was used to determine necrosis (right ). Please note the difference in scale between the two
graphs. B, SW480 cells were pretreated with either NAC for 4 h or DPI for 2 h, followed by treatment with NO-ASA for 18 h as indicated. Annexin V and PI staining
was used to detect necrosis and apoptosis (left ). The isobologram (right) is based on the results of cell death by Annexin V and PI staining and was used to analyze
potential synergy on cell death between NO-ASA and DPI. The additivity line connects the IC50 value of each compound used alone. A and B represent two
different dose pairs of each compound (their respective concentrations are shown for each point). Both A and B seem well below the additivity line signifying
synergy. C, RONS production was detected by staining with DCFDA (general RONS probe). Left, both HT-29 and SW480 cells were pretreated with NAC, followed by
NO-ASA treatment for 3 h; the DCFDA fluorescence intensity was measured by SpectraMax. The induction of RONS in treated samples is shown as fold increase
compared with control cells. Right, SW480 cells were pretreated with DPI for 2 h, followed by NO-ASA treatment for 3 h; the DCFDA fluorescent intensity was measured
by flow cytometry. Values are mean F SE.

death significantly. For example, at 2IC50, NO-ASA cell death
(Annexin V–positive cells) was reduced by 50% by NAC (30.4%
in control, 14.2% in NAC). In contrast, 25 Amol/L DPI potentiated
NO-ASA–induced cell death, increasing the Annexin V–positive
cells from 30.4% to nearly 100% at NO-ASA 2IC50. Examined by
isobolograms (23), the combined effects of DPI and NO-ASA on cell
death represent a clear-cut case of pharmacologic synergy.
We also examined RONS levels in response to NAC and DPI. As
shown in Fig. 2C, 20 mmol/L NAC prevented the induction of
RONS by NO-ASA, keeping their levels at baseline. In the DPI study,
NO-ASA at 1IC50 increased RONS levels of 83% over control. DPI,
in contrast to NAC, increased both basal RONS levels (17% over
control) and NO-ASA–induced RONS levels (204% increase over
cells treated solely with NO-ASA and nearly 3-fold over control).
In these cells, the level of RONS paralleled the degree of cell
death either by apoptosis or necrosis. As Fig. 2A and C shows, such
a correlation existed also for the extent of cell death after
treatment with NAC or DPI (Fig. 2B and C). The type of cell death
(apoptosis versus necrosis) seems to be dependent on the levels of
RONS. For example, lower NO-ASA concentrations (e.g., 1IC50)
induced lower RONS levels, which activated the apoptotic signaling
pathway. Higher NO-ASA concentrations (e.g., >2IC50) led to
higher RONS levels, in which case cell death was due predominantly to necrosis (Figs. 1A and B and 2A). In DPI-pretreated
SW480 cells, the massive RONS production by NO-ASA (3-fold over
control) caused necrosis in nearly all cells.
Anticancer drug–induced RONS modulate NF-KB and MAPK
signaling in colon cancers cells. NF-nB and MAPK are major
determinants of cell renewal and cell death. In general, NF-nB,

whose activation and binding to DNA can be modified by RONS
(24), modulates cell kinetics, but in each case, the specific response
depends upon the biological context (24). MAPKs are serine/
threonine-specific protein kinases that respond to extracellular
stimuli and regulate various cellular activities, such as gene
expression, mitosis, differentiation, cell survival, and cell death (25).
The three major MAPKs, p38, ERK, and JNK, are at least partial
mediators of RONS-induced cellular response.
In our system, we studied the effect of the altered RONS levels on
NF-nB and MAPK activation. NO-ASA inhibited NF-nB activation
after 3 h of treatment (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment with 20 mmol/L NAC
for 4 h restored NF-nB activity to control levels. Pretreatment with
25 Amol/L DPI, however, could not restore NF-nB activity; in fact, it
inhibited NF-nB activity slightly more than NO-ASA alone. Similar
results were obtained with the other three compounds that we
studied. In all cases, the activity of NF-nB (assayed either by an
ELISA method or by EMSA; Fig. 3A) was inhibited by each one of
them, and this inhibition was abrogated by pretreatment with
20 mmol/L NAC for 16 h.
As indicated by their increased phosphorylation, NO-ASA
activated p38, ERK, and JNK as early as 1 hour after initiation
of treatment in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B).
The activation of these MAPKs could be blocked by pretreatment
with 20 mmol/L NAC. DPI had no effect on the activation of
MAPKs induced by NO-ASA.
NO-ASA dissociates the ASK1–Trx-1 complex. ASK1, also
known as MAPK kinase kinase 5 (abbreviated as MAP3K5), is
part of the MAPK cascade (26). ASK1 is inactive when bound to
reduced Trx. When Trx is oxidized by RONS, Trx and ASK1

Figure 4. NO-ASA oxidizes Trx-1, which
mediates oxidative stress-induced cell
death. A, the level of Trx-1 was detected by
Western blot in whole-cell lysates from
SW480 cells treated with NO-ASA for
1 h with or without pretreatment with
NAC or DPI as indicated. B, after the
same treatment as in A , cell lysates were
processed, as in Materials and Methods,
to identify Trx-1 redox forms indicated as
follows: red, reduced form; ox, oxidized
form; the topmost ox band is the one most
oxidized. Cell lysates from HT-29 cells
produced similar results. C, SW480 cells
were transfected with trx-1 siRNA or
nonspecific siRNA for 72 h, and total cell
lysates were analyzed by Western blotting
(top small panel ). After transfection with
siRNA, SW480 cells were treated with
NO-ASA (left bottom ), phosphosulindac,
arsenic trioxide, or phosphoaspirin, as
indicated, and cell death was evaluated by

dissociate and ASK1 autophosphorylates, becoming an active
MAPKKK. Phosphorylation of ASK1 protein can lead to apoptosis
or other cellular responses, depending on cell type. We explored
the status of the ASK1–Trx-1 complex in HT-29 cells in response
to NO-ASA.
As shown in Fig. 3C, treatment of HT-29 cells for 1 hour with
NO-ASA at 2IC50 decreased dramatically the amount of ASK1
associated with Trx-1. This decrease resulted from the dissociation
of the ASK1–Trx-1 complex due to NO-ASA–induced oxidation of
Trx-1 (Fig. 4). This conclusion is supported by the finding that
incubation of the cell lysate with the reducing agent DTT restored
the integrity of the ASK1–Trx-1 complex.
Oxidized Trx participates in oxidative stress-induced cell
death. Trx-1 is one of the most important molecules linking RONS
to NF-nB and MAPK (5). Trx-1 modulates the activity of NF-nB by
interacting directly with it and of MAPK through the ASK1-Trx
signaling complex. In our system, NO-ASA dramatically influenced
RONS-dependent NF-nB and MAPK activities, as well as cell death.
Consequently, we determined whether NO-ASA together with NAC
or DPI could influence the cellular levels and the redox status of
Trx-1.
As shown in Fig. 4A, NO-ASA did not change the total protein
level of Trx-1, and pretreatment with NAC or DPI had no effect on
it. However, we found significant changes in the oxidation status of
Trx-1 in response to treatment with NO-ASA. As described in
Materials and Methods, to detect the oxidized and reduced forms
of Trx-1, protection of the oxidation status of its thiols during
protein extraction was essential. When fully reduced, the five

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

cysteines of Trx-1 generate its reduced form, whereas when
oxidized, they generate its oxidized forms (1). After 1 hour of
treatment of HT-29 cells with NO-ASA, the redox status of Trx-1
changed in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). At low
NO-ASA concentrations (1/8, 1/4, 1/2, and 1IC50), we observed
both reduced and oxidized forms of Trx-1, whereas at high
concentrations (2 and 4IC50), the reduced band was undetectable
and only two oxidized forms were present. SW480 cells gave similar
results (data not shown).
In both HT-29 and SW480 cells, the changes in the redox state of
Trx-1 in response to NO-ASA corresponded closely to the changes
in RONS levels. Furthermore, 20 mmol/L NAC, which completely
suppressed RONS, reduced the oxidized form of Trx-1 that was
generated by NO-ASA. However, 25 Amol/L DPI, which greatly
enhanced RONS levels in the presence of NO-ASA (Fig. 2C), also
enhanced further the oxidation of Trx-1. Combined with NO-ASA,
DPI generated two oxidized forms compared with one oxidized and
one reduced form in cells treated with NO-ASA alone (Fig. 4B).
These findings suggest that RONS generated by NO-ASA (and DPI
when it was used) modulated the redox status of Trx-1.
We then silenced the expression of trx-1 in SW480 cells using
siRNA and determined whether the absence of Trx-1 interfered
with the cell death effect of NO-ASA. As shown in Fig. 4C, 72 hours
after transfection, the protein level of Trx-1 decreased dramatically,
with only a faint band being detected in the Western blot.
Compared with cells treated with control siRNA, NO-ASA induced
much less death in cells transfected with trx-1 siRNA. Tested at
three different concentrations of NO-ASA, the absence of Trx-1

reduced the extent of apoptosis-related cell death by 65% to 70%.
Annexin V (A) positive cells represent either apoptosis [A(+)/PI( )]
or secondary necrosis [A(+)/PI(+)]. Trx-1 was also required for the
ability of the other three compounds to induce cell death. When
SW480 cells, with knocked down expression of Trx-1, were treated
in a similar manner with each of the other three compounds,
apoptosis-related cell death was reduced significantly in each case
(85% by phosphosulindac, 50% by arsenic trioxide, and 86% by
phosphoaspirin). The latter finding indicates a generalized property
of Trx-1 rather than one restricted to the effect of NO-ASA.
Anticancer agents inhibit Trx reductase. Of the four
compounds that we studied, only arsenic trioxide has been
previously evaluated for its effect on Trx-1 (27). This proapoptotic
agent is known to oxidize Trx-1 by inducing RONS production and
by inhibiting the activity of TrxR, the enzyme which normally
reduces oxidized Trx-1. We studied, therefore, the effect of all four
compounds on both the expression and activity of TrxR in SW480
and HT-29 cells.
After treatment with NO-ASA for 1 h, TrxR activity was
decreased concentration-dependently in SW480 and HT-29 cells
(Fig. 5A). The other three compounds also reduced the activity
of TrxR. However, the protein level of TrxR was not changed by
NO-ASA, even when the incubation period was prolonged to
6 hours or when high concentrations of NO-ASA (up to 4IC50)

were used. Thus, changes in TrxR levels are an unlikely explanation
for its reduced activity.
To further evaluate the effect of oxidized Trx-1 on oxidative
stress-induced cell death, we used the TrxR inhibitor aurothiomalate (ATM), which prevents the conversion of oxidized Trx-1 to
its reduced form (28). Cells pretreated with 50 or 100 Amol/L ATM
for 24 hours were exposed to NO-ASA at its 0.5IC50 concentration
for 16 hours. ATM increased cell death from 12% (NO-ASA alone)
to 34% or 41% at 50 or 100 Amol/L ATM, respectively. At a higher
NO-ASA concentration (1IC50), ATM increased cell death from
29% (NO-ASA alone) to 52% or 62% at 50 or 100 Amol/L ATM,
respectively. Examined by isobolograms (23), the effects of ATM
on cell death represent pharmacologic synergy (Fig. 5C).
Combined with the siRNA results, these findings strongly suggest
that the oxidized form of Trx-1 provides a critical contribution to
cell death in response to anticancer agents that share the ability to
induce RONS.

Discussion
Our data show that four anticancer agents generate in human
colon cancer cell lines a state of oxidative stress, which involves
at least four individual RONS. This effect is accompanied by
changes in two critical cell signaling cascades, NF-nB and MAPK,

Figure 6. The redox status of Trx-1 modulates cell survival. Dependence on
intracellular RONS levels. This diagram depicts the relationship between Trx-1,
TrxR, and RONS. As RONS levels increase, Trx-1 changes from its completely
reduced form (Trx-1red ) to partially oxidized (Trx-1ox-I ) to its fully oxidized form
(Trx-1ox-II ). TrxR, which reverses the oxidation of Trx-1, was also inhibited by
the compounds we studied. At low RONS concentrations, when Trx-1 is in its
reduced form, cell death is minimal. As RONS concentrations increase, cell
death is evident, becoming massive at the highest RONS concentrations. The
predominance of apoptosis at intermediate RONS levels is replaced by necrosis
at higher RONS levels.

both responsive to RONS, and culminates in apoptotic or necrotic
cell death, with the specific type of cell death depending on
RONS levels. The Trx system plays a pivotal role in the induction
of oxidative stress, as Trx-1 and TrxR are altered in a way
that prevents them from countering the prooxidant effect of
RONS.
The four anticancer agents that we used are structurally diverse.
Three of them have shown anticancer properties in preclinical
models, whereas the fourth, arsenic trioxide, is the drug of choice
for the treatment of promyelocytic leukemia. Their IC50s for cell
growth are similar, ranging between 10 and 90 Amol/L. Our data
establish that their common property is the induction of RONS in
two colon cancer cell lines, documented by the response of the
general RONS probe DCFDA. In the case of NO-ASA, which was
studied in greater detail, the induction of RONS involved at least
four individual species, NO, H2O2, ONOO , and O.2 . These
compounds encompass a wide range of reactivities and biological
behavior. The mitochondria showed the most notable production
of O.2 . The reaction of O.2 with NO may be the sole source of the
very reactive (and damaging) ONOO . The ultimate result of the
generation of RONS was cell death; the etiologic relationship
between the two was underscored by the abrogation of cell death
by NAC, which blocked the generation of RONS by NO-ASA. A
remarkable finding was the clear relationship between RONS levels
and the type of cell death: apoptosis at lower RONS concentrations
and necrosis at higher levels.
Contrary to expectations, DPI potentiated the generation of
RONS and, consequently, the degree of cell death. In fact, DPI
synergized with NO-ASA, as was formally shown by our data
analysis. DPI, considered predominantly as an antioxidant, is also
known to have prooxidant properties, and this may indeed be
the case here. It is unclear what determined the type of response
to DPI.

RONS are increasingly appreciated as significant signaling
molecules, a role distinct from their potentially catastrophic
effects, which occur at high concentrations and represent
the situation conventionally described as oxidative stress (29).
NO-ASA activated MAPKs, a signaling pathway also known to be
redox responsive (25). NAC prevented, to a large extent, the
activation of these pathways, establishing a potential causeand-effect relationship with RONS. In addition, all four compounds
inhibited NF-nB activation. In each case, RONS seem to have been
the responsible signaling molecules, as NAC abrogated their effect
on NF-nB and DPI, which unexpectedly increased RONS levels,
inhibited further the activity of NF-nB (which was already inhibited
by NO-ASA). An important proximal signaling molecule in this
cascade is ASK1, which, as mentioned, is physically associated with
reduced Trx-1. Our data confirmed this association and also
showed that NO-ASA, which oxidized Trx-1, released ASK1,
whereas reduction of Trx-1 by the reducing agent DTT favored
formation of the Trx-1–ASK1 complex.
The redox status of the cell regulates NF-nB activity, but the
specific response (NF-nB inhibition or activation) seems to be
dependent on cell type and perhaps on the individual RONS
involved (24, 30). Direct interactions of RONS with the NF-nB
subunits or with proteins in the NF-nB regulatory cascade have
been described. Cysteine residue(s) of NF-nB subunits are involved
in its recognition of and binding to DNA, such as the redoxsensitive Cys62 residue of p50, whereas the redox control
mechanism mediated by Trx may regulate NF-nB–dependent gene
expression (31, 32). The most reasonable explanation of our data is
that the four anticancer agents induced RONS, which interacted
either directly or indirectly with NF-nB, inhibiting its ability to
bind to its cognate DNA recognition sequence (inhibition of NF-nB
activation). The effects of NAC and DPI strongly support this
notion.
The Trx system, along with GSH, is currently thought to be at the
heart of the antioxidant response of a mammalian cell. In the face
of high RONS levels in response to NO-ASA, it is easy to anticipate
that Trx-1, with its wide substrate specificity, was extensively
oxidized as it engaged in the reduction of its many oxidized client
proteins. Here again, the degree of Trx-1 oxidation paralleled the
amount of RONS, and such oxidation was prevented by
pretreatment with NAC and exacerbated by DPI. At the highest
NO-ASA concentrations, the oxidation of Trx-1 seemed complete.
Trx-1 seemed to play a central role in the growth inhibitory effect
of NO-ASA. In particular, when its expression was knocked down
by siRNA, the proapoptotic effect of NO-ASA and other three
compounds was abrogated; this effect was nearly complete (except
for the 50% reduction by arsenic trioxide).
TrxR, the enzyme that reduces oxidized Trx-1, was significantly
inhibited by these compounds, and this explains, at least partially,
the persistence of the oxidized form of Trx-1. That the interaction
between Trx-1 and its reductase is important in these cells was
further substantiated by the finding that a TrxR inhibitor actually
synergized with NO-ASA to inhibit cell death. It is, therefore, likely
that the Trx system suffered a dual assault consisting of (a)
inhibition of TrxR by these agents and (b) oxidation of Trx-1, as it
had to reduce its client proteins that were extensively oxidized by
RONS. The end result was the oxidation of Trx-1, which in its
extreme form became complete and culminated in massive cell
death (Fig. 6).
The exact mechanism by which oxidized Trx-1 participates
in the induction of cell death by these compounds is not

fully delineated. It is, however, clear that NF-nB and MAPKs
are modulated in our experimental system. Both pathways (a)
have been previously documented to be critical for the growth
inhibitory effect of NO-ASA, (13, 33) and (b) depend on Trx for their
oxidation status that determines their biological activity. Based on
the known role of Trx-1 in the regulation of transcription factors, it
is likely that the oxidation of Trx-1 is proximal to NF-nB and
MAPKs. Indeed, in the case of MAPK activation, the release of
ASK1 from its complex with Trx-1 represents a convincing
mechanistic link between the two.
In conclusion, our data show the significant regulatory role of
the Trx system in the induction of cell death by four diverse
anticancer compounds. It is reasonable to consider that the
mechanism presented here may be shared by more compounds in
