Realising the Promise of Cancer Predisposition Genes
Nazneen Rahman, MD PhD

Abstract
Genes in which germline mutations confer high or moderate increased risks of cancer are called
cancer predisposition genes (CPG). Over 100 CPGs have been identified providing important
scientific insights in many areas, particularly mechanisms of cancer causation. Moreover, clinical
utilisation of CPGs has had substantial impact in diagnosis, optimised management and prevention
of cancer. The recent transformative advances in DNA sequencing bring the promise of many
more CPG discoveries and greater, broader clinical applications. However, there is also
considerable potential for incorrect inferences and inappropriate clinical applications. Realising
the promise of cancer predisposition genes for science and medicine will thus require careful
navigation.

Genetic predisposition to cancer has been recognised for centuries, initially through
observation of unusual familial clusterings of cancer. In 1866 neuroanatomist Paul Broca
published one of the earliest reports, detailing a striking history of breast cancer in fifteen
members of his wife’s family1. Broca, controversially for the time, proposed this was
evidence of hereditary predisposition to cancer. Fifty years later, Theodor Boveri published
his visionary theory that somatic acquisition of ‘particular, incorrect chromosome
combinations’ underlie cancer. His paper was equally prophetic about inherited
predisposition to cancer, predicting it could result from ‘weakened resistance against the
action of factors that stimulate cell division’2. In 1971, Knudson’s mathematical modelling
of the epidemiology of retinoblastoma suggested a ‘two-hit’ model whereby both alleles of a
specific gene were required to be inactivated for retinoblastoma to occur, thus echoing
Boveri’s predictions3. In 1987 the retinoblastoma predisposition gene, RB1, was discovered
and, as predicted, in hereditary cases one allele was mutated in the germline with the second
allele inactivated somatically4.
There is no definitive definition of a cancer predisposition gene (CPG). For the purposes of
this review I have restricted inclusion to genes in which rare mutations confer high or
moderate risks of cancer (>2 fold relative risks) and at least 5% of individuals with relevant
mutations develop cancer. For the majority of genes both the risks and penetrance are
considerably higher than these minimum criteria. Common variants conferring very small
increases in risk discovered through genome-wide association studies are not included
within this definition. Such variants are important components of the genetic architecture of
cancer and are addressed in several other reviews5–7. Through extensive literature and
database evaluations I identified 114 CPGs which form the basis of this review (Fig 1,
Supplementary Table 1).

Traditionally cancer predisposition reviews have focussed on select cancers and/or sets of
genes. In an era of whole genome sequencing, information about all known CPGs is
increasingly desirable in both research and clinical practice. Here, I have aspired to integrate
knowledge from three decades of research to provide a distillation of key CPG
characteristics. I also discuss the exciting prospects and potential pitfalls of future
discoveries and clinical applications.

Discovery of cancer predisposition genes
The 114 CPGs were discovered over the last thirty years through multiple different strategies
(Fig 2). Since 1990 at least one new CPG has been identified each year, peaking in 1996
when ten CPGs were reported8–16. Genome-wide linkage analysis, an agnostic approach
that allows tracking of disease-associated genomic markers in high-penetrance familial
clusters has been the most successful strategy, yielding 59 CPGs, mostly in the 1990s when
the methodology became routine. More recently, next-generation sequencing is leading to a
new crop of CPGs being discovered through genome-wide mutational analyses such as
exome and genome sequencing17,18.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The remaining genes were identified through various candidate-based strategies. Large
numbers of candidate CPGs have been proposed and investigated. For the majority, no
association with cancer predisposition has been found. This perceived failure led to
candidate-based approaches falling from favour. However, certain strategies have proved
very successful both as stand-alone discovery methods and in facilitating linkage studies.
Candidates pursued as surrogates of cancer predisposition for example distinctive cellular
phenotypes such as defective DNA repair, mosaic aneuploidies or telomere shortening have
contributed to the discovery of many CPGs9,10,19,20. Genetic pathway candidates, i.e.
genes selected because they function in similar pathways to known CPGs, has also yielded
new predisposition genes, particularly in colorectal, breast, ovarian and endocrine
cancers21–28. Candidate genes chosen because they are somatically mutated in cancers
have, perhaps surprisingly, led to the identification of only twelve CPGs29–40.
Overlap of somatic and germline cancer genes
It is interesting and instructive to consider the overlap between the known germline and
tumor mutated cancer genes. Currently, the COSMIC database includes 468 genes
somatically mutated in cancers41. Of these, 49 are also known to be CPGs. Conversely, 65
of the 114 CPGs are known to be somatically mutated. These data imply that 10% of
somatically mutated cancer genes also confer susceptibility to cancer when mutated in the
germline, but that 40% of germline mutated cancer predisposition genes can also contribute
to oncogenesis when mutations occur only in tumors (Fig 3). This apparent discrepancy is,
at least in part, an artefact of different research approaches; it is common for the frequency
of somatic CPG mutations to be investigated but it is unusual for somatically mutated genes
to be evaluated for their role in cancer predisposition. The latter has been exacerbated by
cancer genome sequencing studies in which a key filtering step is removal of variants
present in normal tissue to focus attention on the potential cancer-driving mutations present
only in the tumor42. It is thus highly likely that there is an underestimate of the overlap

between somatic cancer driver mutations and germline cancer predisposing mutations and
mutual interrogation of such genes could prove a useful approach for identification of new
cancer genes.
Overlap of high and low penetrance cancer associated variants

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

One notable absentee in the successful CPG discovery strategies is identification through
genome-wide association study candidature. There are 391 known common variants that
confer small increased risks of cancer43 (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/). The
underlying causal gene/mechanism has only been identified for a small minority, but none
have been shown to be sentinels of rare, higher penetrance mutations in new CPGs.
Furthermore, only 15 SNPs are within known CPGs and none are associated with cancers
that occur in carriers of rare, penetrant mutations. For example, ATM D1853N, (the only
exonic cancer GWAS variant in a CPG), confers a protective effect of melanoma but it is not
associated with the cancers that occur in biallelic or monoallelic ATM mutation
carriers44,45. Similarly, rs78378222 alters the polyadenylation signal of TP53 and is
associated with various cancers, but not those that typically occur in Li Fraumeni syndrome,
which is due to germline TP53 mutations46. Multiple variants in the vicinity of TERT have
been associated with several different cancers, but again not those that occur in dyskeratosis
congenita, a recessive condition due to germline exonic TERT mutations 47–49. These data
suggest the mechanisms underlying the association with cancer of rare, high penetrance
alleles and common, low penetrance alleles are largely distinct. This differs from several
other common, complex conditions which show considerable overlap between these
components of the genetic architecture50,51.

Characteristics of cancer predisposition genes
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The 114 genes are located throughout the genome with little evidence of chromosomal
clustering (Fig 1).
Inheritance and mechanisms of oncogenesis
The inheritance pattern of cancer predisposition is varied; autosomal dominant for 65 CPGs,
autosomal recessive for 28, X-linked for four and one is Y-linked. 16 genes cause
phenotypes in both monoallelic and biallelic mutation carriers, i.e. they cause autosomal
dominant and autosomal recessive conditions. For half of these the recessive condition is a
more severe manifestation of the dominant condition. For example, biallelic BRCA2,
PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 mutation carriers have high risks of childhood cancer
whereas monoallelic mutation carriers have increased risks of adult cancers52. For other
genes in which monoallelic and biallelic mutations cause clinical phenotypes, such as FH
and SDHA, cancer has not been reported in biallelic mutation carriers. This is likely due to
early mortality from other manifestations.
The great majority of CPGs act as tumor suppressor genes with mutations that abrogate their
function promoting oncogenesis. Only eleven genes predispose to cancer through gain-offunction mutations. Several of these, such as RET, MET, KIT and ALK, encode kinases
which are rendered constitutively active by cancer predisposing mutations53. There is much

more diversity in the types, functions and mechanisms of oncogenesis of CPGs that are
inactivated to increase the risk of cancer. Many are classic tumor suppressor genes, requiring
both alleles to be inactivated, but haploinsufficiency and dominant-negative mechanisms
also occur. For some genes different mutations operate through different mechanisms and
lead to distinct phenotypes as described below54,55. For many genes, the clinical
phenotypes and cancer risks associated with CPG mutations are also influenced by other
factors, both genetic and non-genetic.
Functions of cancer predisposition genes
CPG research has directly resulted in fundamental insights into basic biological pathways
and gene function. Indeed, some centrally important genes were first isolated because
germline mutations within them predispose to cancer, as is transparent in their names
(BRCA1, RB1, NF1 etc) which reflect the clinical phenotypes that led to their identification.
The functions of these genes were only subsequently elucidated, often directly because of
research into their role in cancer predisposition.
CPGs have a very broad range of different functions. Many are ubiquitously expressed and
participate in fundamental processes such as DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. One of
the enduring conundrums of cancer predisposition is why, and how, perturbation of universal
cellular functions can cause exquisitely specific cancer phenotypes. However, some genes
have organ-specific functions that are transparently related to the cancers with which they
are associated. For example, mutations in SLC25A13, ABCB11, FAH, HMBS and UROD
all lead to hepatic overload, liver cirrhosis and hence an increased the risk of hepatocellular
carcinoma56.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Meaningful evaluation of the 114 CPGs for functional associations is currently precluded
because so many were identified due to their functional relationships with known CPGs.
Nonetheless, some noteworthy functional networks are emerging as important in cancer
predisposition, in addition to well-recognised pathways such as DNA repair. Amongst these
are the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling pathway which has been particularly linked to
rhabdoid tumors and meningiomas, the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme complex which is
associated with phaeochromocytoma and paragangliomas and the PI3kinase/mTOR
signalling pathway which has links with several CPGs including TSC1, TSC2, PTEN,
LKB1, FLCN, HRAS, TMEM127 and hence is associated with a diverse cancers57–59.

Cancer predisposition gene phenotypes
Cancer phenotypes
It is currently estimated that ~3% of cancers are due to CPG mutations, which is >300,000
cancers per year worldwide. This is an underestimate as the contribution of known genes has
been poorly characterised and not all genes have been identified. The contribution to
individual cancers is highly variable. The highest attribution is to childhood embryonal
tumors such as retinoblastoma and pleuropulmonary blastoma which are often caused by
germline mutations in RB1 and DICER1 respectively29,60. This simplicity is not applicable
to all childhood cancers; the embryonal kidney cancer, Wilms tumor, is associated with

several CPGs and other predisposition mechanisms, which together account for <5% of
cases61,62. At the other end of the spectrum, known CPGs make a very small contribution
to some adult cancers, such as prostate and lung cancer. However, germline CPG mutations
in multiple genes predispose to other adult cancers such as breast, colorectal, melanoma and
ovarian cancer. For some the overall contribution of CPGs is sizeable with ~15% of ovarian
cancer, ~20% of medullary thyroid cancer and >30% of phaeochromocytoma due to CPG
mutations63–65.
Some CPGs preferentially predispose to specific histological subtypes of a cancer. For
example BRCA1 is particularly associated with triple-negative breast cancer and serous
ovarian cancer, whereas CDH1 is particularly associated with lobular breast cancer and
diffuse gastric cancers66,67. The genomic profiles of cancers arising in individuals with
germline CPG mutations can also be distinctive; chromothripsis, which describes localised
chromosomal shattering, is striking in medulloblastomas that occur in TP53 germline
mutation carriers and cancers in BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers have a characteristic
mutational signature that include substantial numbers of deletions with overlapping
microhomology at the breakpoint junctions68,69.
Non-cancer phenotypes

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Clinical phenotypes in addition to cancer often occur in individuals with CPG mutations
with 87 CPGs being associated with non-cancer clinical features. These are often more
discriminating and more common than cancer, and can be critical to clinical diagnosis of the
underlying cancer syndrome. The spectrum of additional clinical features is very broad. Skin
manifestations are most frequent and can be specific to the relevant CPG. They include
hypopigmented and/or hyperpigmented areas, freckling, rashes, blistering, hypertrophy, skin
tags, nodules and/or lumps. Neurological, dysmorphic and skeletal manifestations also
occur, but are usually non-specific features such as microcephaly, macrocephaly, short
stature and/or developmental delay. The proportion of CPGs associated with non-cancer
clinical phenotypes is likely an over-estimate of the true proportion, as identification of
genes that result in a readily clinically recognisable phenotype is inevitably more tractable.

Genotype-phenotype associations
One of the illuminating outcomes of CPG research has been increased knowledge about the
diversity of mutational mechanisms and their relationship with phenotype. Even
superficially straightforward associations can mask profound complexity. For example, gainof-function germline HRAS missense mutations cause enhanced MAPK and P13 kinase
signalling similar to somatic mutations70. However, the spectrum of germline and somatic
mutations differs, and germline HRAS mutations not only predispose to cancer, they cause a
multisystem disorder called Costello syndrome71. This condition includes distinctive facial
dysmorphism and a wide range of cardiac, dermatological, musculoskeletal and
developmental abnormalities. The role of HRAS in these processes and why HRAS
mutations lead to such a complex phenotype is unknown.
The genotype-phenotype relationships of some CPGs are extraordinarily intricate and hint at
deep uncharted complexities in gene function. Most WT1 mutations predispose to Wilms

tumor, genitourinary abnormalities and renal dysfunction, the severity of which is influenced
by the mutational type. However, intronic mutations that alter the relative abundance of WT1
isoforms cause a distinct condition, called Frasier syndrome, which includes
gonadoblastoma rather than Wilms tumor, a focal-segmental nephropathy and severe
gonadal dysgenesis which can manifest as complete sex reversal61.

TERT, which encodes telomerase, is another example. Recently, activating promoter
mutations that result in increased telomerase expression were shown to predispose to
melanoma72. Monoallelic and biallelic, primarily missense TERT mutations cause
dyskeratosis congenita, which is characterised by various physical abnormalities, pulmonary
fibrosis, bone marrow failure and increased incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia and
squamous carcinomas of the head and neck and anogenital region48. Furthermore, various
common SNPs in the vicinity of TERT confer small risks of several cancers, including
breast, colorectal, testicular and prostate cancer47,49. The mechanisms underlying the
diversity of TERT phenotypic associations are unknown.
TGFBR1, which encodes a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptor, is one of the
most extreme examples of genotype-phenotype diversity. Missense mutations in the kinase
domain cause marfanoid vasculopathies with no increased risk of cancer. Truncating
mutations in the same kinase domain, or missense mutations in the extracellular ligandbinding domain, cause a highly unusual condition called multiple self-healing squamous
epithelioma. Affected individuals develop squamous carcinoma-like locally invasive skin
tumors that grow rapidly for a few weeks then spontaneously regress and scar73.

Cancer predisposition gene cancer risks
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

There is also deep and widely underappreciated complexity in the risks of cancer conferred
by CPG mutations. A specific CPG mutation can confer different risks of different cancers.
Different CPG mutations can confer different risks of a particular cancer. A specific CPG
mutation can even confer different risks of a particular cancer in different contexts. The
BRCA2 gene illustrates all these scenarios. Loss-of-function BRCA2 mutations confer
substantial increased lifetime risks of breast and ovarian cancer but only small increased
lifetime risks of prostate and pancreatic cancer74. However not all mutations confer the
same risk, despite the great majority being protein truncating mutations predicted to result in
nonsense-mediated RNA decay and thus to be functionally equivalent. BRCA2 loss-offunction mutations in the central part of the gene confer significantly higher relative risks of
ovarian cancer compared to breast cancer than mutations at either end75. The mechanistic
basis for this highly unusual pattern remains unknown. The degree of family history also
impacts on the risk of cancer of BRCA2 mutations. The lifetime breast cancer risk of female
BRCA2 mutation carriers with a strong family history is ~80% but is only ~45% for
relatives of unselected breast cancer cases76,77. This reflects, at least in part, additional
modifying factors within familial clusters that increase the cancer risk. Some genetic and
non-genetic modifying factors of BRCA2 and BRCA1 cancer risks have already been
identified, though it is likely there is still much to be discovered.78–81.

TP53 is another gene that has been known to predispose to cancer for over 20 years and yet
our knowledge of the associated cancer risks is still lamentably incomplete. All germline
TP53 mutations are typically assumed to be highly penetrant, but the widely quoted cancer
lifetime risks are derived from small series of highly selected cases82. In fact there is strong
evidence of high variability in the types and risks of cancer associated with different TP53
mutations. This is exemplified by TP53 R337H which confers a modest 10% risk of
adrenocortical cancer and is not associated with increased risks of other classic Li Fraumeni
cancers such as breast cancer or sarcoma83.

Clinical utility of cancer predisposition genes
The identification of CPGs has had substantial clinical impact. Indeed cancer is one of the
foremost diseases in which such discoveries have transformed medical care in multiple
areas, including cancer prevention.
Diagnosis and patient management

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The benefits of determining if a cancer is due to a germline CPG mutation are
incontrovertible. As such, CPG testing has become standard for many genes, albeit typically
only in highly selected cases. From the patient perspective, simply having a better
understanding of why their cancer occurred is usually highly valued. It also provides
important information that can aid diagnosis and management, for instance whether to have
conservative or radical surgery. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be also altered. For
example, platinum based therapies are not standard treatment for breast cancer but can have
utility in BRCA carriers84,85. Conversely, temozolomide is unlikely to be of benefit and
may actually promote neoplastic progression in MSH6 mutation carriers86,87. Identifying
an underlying CPG mutation also provides important prognostic information; survival is
significantly better for BRCA2 mutation-positive ovarian cancer patients but significantly
worse for BRCA2 mutation-positive prostate cancer patients88,89. The likelihood of
recurrence, a new primary and/or a second malignancy can all be increased in CPG mutation
carriers who require ongoing review and consideration of tailored surveillance and/or riskreducing interventions. Management of non-cancer associated problems can also be
important, for example certain WT1 mutations result in insidious renal dysfunction which
requires monitoring and early intervention.
Targeted therapies
There is intense activity in developing tailored therapies for cancer and strategies targeting
CPGs and their constituent pathways have been amongst the most innovative and fruitful.
The rationale is to harness knowledge of the underlying cause of cancer to identify tumorspecific vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically exploited. The simplest model is in
cancers caused by gain-of-function mutations which can be directly downregulated by
inhibitors such as imatinib (KIT, PDGFRA), vandetanib (RET) and foretinib (MET)90–92.
Trying to switch on genes that have been mutationally inactivated is more challenging. A
direct approach of using compounds that ‘read-through’ stop codons is showing some
promise, as is gene therapy93,94. Inhibiting a pathway member that is upregulated as a
result of the CPG mutation has also had success. For example, everolimus, an mTOR

inhibitor, is now approved for treatment of astrocytomas in tuberous sclerosis and
vismodegib, which inhibits the hedgehog pathway, has shown responses in basal-cell nevus
syndrome patients with PTCH1 mutations95,96. Perhaps, the most innovative approach has
been through inducing synthetic lethality. PARP inhibitors, which cause lethality in BRCA
deficient tumor cells but not normal cells with monoallelic mutations exemplify this
approach, which is now being pursued for other CPGs97–99. Currently, these therapies are
still largely being evaluated in research studies and clinical trials, but there is optimism that
identification of CPG mutations will increasingly lead to personalised management for
cancer patients.
Screening and prevention

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

An important benefit of CPG testing is in providing information about cancer risks for
relatives. One of the unusual characteristics of CPGs is their capacity to serve as a biomarker
of future disease. Identifying a CPG mutation can provide a window of opportunity to
implement surveillance and/or risk-reducing measures that mitigate or prevent cancer. The
type of screening is naturally determined by the type of cancer but most often involves
imaging to detect a lesion before it presents clinically. Sometimes a biochemical marker of
risk can be measured, such as catecholamines or calcitonin in individuals at-risk of
phaeochromocytoma or thyroid cancer respectively100. The presumption is that if a cancer
is detected early, treatment and survival will be improved, though this has rarely been proven
and for some cancers the available evidence does not suggest benefit101. Prevention usually
involves surgical removal of the at-risk tissue and is necessarily reserved for non-essential
organs in individuals at very high-risk, such as the stomach in CDH1 mutation carriers, the
thyroid in RET mutation carriers and the colon in APC mutation carriers100,102,103.
Chemoprevention is an attractive strategy but to date there have been few applications. A
notable exception is mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in whom the risk of colorectal
cancer is significantly reduced by daily aspirin104. Of equal value, though commanding
much less fanfare, is the use of CPG mutation testing in identifying people without a familial
CPG mutation. Such individuals are released from anxiety for themselves and their
offspring, and do not require costly interventions.

Pitfalls in CPG research and clinical practice
The study of CPGs has led to tremendous scientific and medical advancements of broad and
lasting impact. However, the field has been hampered by incorrect interpretations of genetic
data, which can have substantial negative consequences.
The first major problem is the incorrect classification of a gene as a CPG. There are,
unfortunately, dozens of genes in widely-used databases such as OMIM and HGMD that are
designated CPGs but for which the evidence is at best uncertain. For the majority,
interpretation of available data strongly suggests the gene does not confer high or moderate
risks of cancer. There are various reasons for these misclassifications. Until recently, the
extent of human coding variation was poorly appreciated leading to over-estimation of the
likely causal link between the presence of a gene variant and cancer in an individual. This
problem is actually increasing with exome sequencing studies, with many researchers failing

to appreciate that rare coding variation, including putative deleterious mutations, are
collectively common105,106. The most widespread misconception is that absence from
controls of a specific rare mutation identified in cancer cases provides evidence of causality,
when it merely provides additional evidence that it is rare.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Over-extrapolation of concepts and data is a pervasive problem in CPG research and
manifests in many ways. Firstly, it is often presumed that if a gene mutation causes one
cancer that any other cancer that occurs in a mutation carrier is also likely attributable to that
gene, whereas frequently it will be coincidental because cancer is very common. Secondly, it
is frequently incorrectly assumed that because one mutation class (e.g. truncating mutations)
predisposes to cancer that variants in other classes (e.g. missense mutations) are also
causative, but many will be rare, innocuous variants. Thirdly, it is commonly assumed that if
some genes in a pathway are CPGs that variants in other gene members of that pathway are
de facto likely to predispose to cancer. Fifthly, it is widely believed that cancer risks of CPG
mutations are constant and can be extrapolated from one context to another, whereas many
factors can influence the clinical expression of a CPG mutation, as outlined above. Finally, it
is often incorrectly assumed that if a variant is shown to have some kind of functional
impact, this proves it is pathogenic. CPGs have multiple complex functions and the
relationship between functional aberrations and clinical phenotype is typically unclear or
unknown. There are virtually no CPG functional mutational assays that have been validated
as robust tests of clinical pathogenicity. Thus although functional data can provide
supportive evidence for pathogenicity it can very rarely serve as a substitute for robust
genetic evidence.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The extent to which these presumptions lead to incorrect scientific inferences and
inappropriate clinical management depends on the specific CPG and scenario. However,
significant and unacceptable negative impacts can result, including unwarranted surgery in
healthy individuals.

Future opportunities and challenges
The future for CPG research is very bright both in terms of scientific discovery and clinical
translation. Strong evidence from multiple sources indicates that more CPGs remain to be
discovered. Exome and genome sequencing are ideally suited to their identification, though
standards to ensure consistent, robust designation as a CPG are required. For familial and
syndromic cancer conditions, exome sequencing methods developed for Mendelian
disorders will likely be successful, and are already yielding new genes17,18. As with other
common complex conditions, identification of non-syndromic genes will remain
challenging, at least until it is possible to sequence, analyse and interpret data from many
thousands of individuals. Innovative sample and analytical prioritisation strategies, in the
spirit of those used so successfully in the past will thus likely have high utility over the next
few years106.
It is also important to recognise that in this review I have focussed on germline gene
mutations with high/intermediate risks of cancer. Other components of the genetic
architecture of cancer predisposition, such as common variants with small effects are also

important and the interplay of different genes and variants is a topical field that will likely
reveal new, clinically relevant insights78,81,107. It is also increasingly apparent that many
other mechanisms are likely to play a role. One emerging area is the role of mosaic
mutations, particularly in individuals with multiple cancers. Genetic and epigenetic cancer
predisposing post-zygotic events have been identified, for example mosaic HIF2A mutations
in individuals with paraganglioma and H19 hypermethylation in children with bilateral
Wilms tumor108,109. More recently, mosaic PPM1D mutations associated with increased
risks of ovarian and breast cancer have been reported, though the mechanism of cancer
association is currently unclear110. Thus, although a considerable proportion of genetic
predisposition to cancer likely resides in CPGs, the genetic architecture of cancer
predisposition also includes other components, many of which may be undiscovered.
Further opportunities to use CPGs to improve management of cancer patients should be
vigorously pursued. This will lead to optimised, personalised care for mutation carriers and
will likely provide insights of broader relevance to cancer, as exemplified by countless CPGbased discoveries of the past. The rarity of CPG mutations impedes research and improved
networks and registries of mutation carriers would greatly enhance the field. Routine
integration of germline CPG testing into clinical trials will be invaluable, as will better
collaborative links between somatic and germline cancer research. Probably the most
important goal, which would facilitate all the above, is to increase availability of CPG
testing to cancer patients. Next-generation sequencing makes large-scale, high-throughput
CPG testing possible and affordable, but the clinical infrastructure needed to appropriately
deliver such testing requires development. Various initiatives are seeking to achieve this,
such as the UK Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics programme (www.mcgprogramme.com).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

It is imperative that comprehensive evaluation of known CPGs in large patient and
population series is performed so their cancer risks, clinical phenotypes, genotypephenotype associations, genetic and non-genetic modifying factors and contribution to
cancer can be clarified. Large-scale, international, integrated molecular and clinical
databases and analysis will greatly facilitate these endeavours. Enthusiasm for feedback of
incidental findings is best tempered until these data are available. Recently the American
College of Medical Genetics issued a policy statement recommending incidental findings in
24 CPGs should be returned, irrespective of age or specific consent111. This has stimulated
intense debate about possible ethical and legal ramifications. However, scant attention has
been given to the arguably more pressing concern of our insufficient knowledge about the
clinical consequences of mutations identified opportunistically. As discussed above, there is
evidence to suggest the impact of incidental mutations may differ substantially from
mutations detected in individuals with a clinical phenotype and thus more curation and more
caution are required.
That being said, the impact of CPG mutations in the general population is of high interest
and has potential to provide health benefits and opportunities for cancer prevention. It is
often assumed cancer surveillance is of intrinsic value and should automatically be instituted
in CPG mutation carriers. However, for most surveillance programmes there is little or no
actual evidence of an improvement in outcome. The lack of proven efficacy and the potential
risks of screening, such as overdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, false positives and false negatives

are rarely discussed. The low frequency of CPG conditions makes randomised clinical
surveillance trials challenging. It also leads to the misguided impression that ad-hoc
screening in individual CPG families is a trivial burden. In fact, instituting decades of
surveillance to relatives in a single family can be a very considerable financial outlay. To
implement at population level, which may insidiously occur as genome sequencing becomes
routine, could spiral into sizeable strains on the capacity and purse of health services. This is
particularly likely if individuals with rare variants of unproven pathogenicity are
(inappropriately) included in enhanced surveillance programmes, as is currently often the
case. To ensure consistent, appropriate, affordable management of at-risk individuals there
needs to be a grass-roots move away from reflex interventions to application and adherence
to the accepted criteria of effective screening tests112. In parallel, we need to invest energy
in developing carefully considered and evaluated strategies that maximise the benefits of
identifying people at increased risk of cancer.
