ABSTRACT
In searching for small-molecule compounds that inhibit proliferation and survival
of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells and may, therefore, be exploited as
potential therapeutic agents for this disease, we identified the commonly used and
well-tolerated antibiotic doxycycline as a strong candidate. Here, we demonstrate
that doxycycline inhibits the growth of DLBCL cells both in vitro and in mouse
xenograft models. In addition, we show that doxycycline accumulates in DLBCL cells
to high concentrations and affects multiple signaling pathways that are crucial for
lymphomagenesis. Our data reveal the deneddylating activity of COP-9 signalosome
(CSN) as a novel target of doxycycline and suggest that doxycycline may exert its
effects in DLBCL cells in part through a CSN5-HSP90 pathway. Consistently, knockdown
of CSN5 exhibited similar effects as doxycycline treatment on DLBCL cell survival and
HSP90 chaperone function. In addition to DLBCL cells, doxycycline inhibited growth
of several other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells in vitro. Together, our results
suggest that doxycycline may represent a promising therapeutic agent for DLBCL and
other non-Hodgkin lymphomas subtypes.

(rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone) and most of them will
die of the disease within two years of diagnosis [1–4].
Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are urgently
needed to combat this malignancy. DLBCL comprises
a heterogeneous mixture of distinct lymphomas with
different clinical outcomes. Gene expression profiling
studies have classified DLBCLs into at least three
major subgroups: the germinal center B-cell (GCB), the

activated B-cell (ABC), and the mediastinal large B-cell
(PMBL) DLBCL [5–7]. Virtually all ABC DLBCL, the
least curable DLBCL subtype, and a significant fraction
of GCB DLBCL exhibit constitutive NF-κB pathway
activity [5, 8–12]. Notably, ABC DLBCL cells depend
on constitutive NF-κB signaling for proliferation and
survival [11, 13–15]. Targeting pathways required for
NF-κB activation thus has been proposed as a novel
treatment strategy for DLBCL [16, 17].
Doxycycline is an inexpensive, commonly used
and well-tolerated antimicrobial agent. In addition to
its antibiotic effect, doxycycline possesses various
non-antimicrobial activities. These include its wellstudied ability to inhibit the activities of various matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) as well as its inhibition of
MMP gene expression. Additionally, doxycycline has
been reported to have anti-inflammatory activity as well
as potential antineoplastic activity [18–26]. The molecular
mechanisms underlying the non-antibiotic activities of
doxycycline have remained poorly understood.
The Connectivity Map, which was generated from
a collection of genome-wide gene expression profiles
of cultured human cells treated with various bioactive
small molecules, including FDA-approved drugs,
allows the discovery of potential connections between
drugs and signaling pathways [27]. In order to identify
drugs that inhibit NF-κB target gene expression and may
thereby inhibit the proliferation and survival of DLBCL
cells, we carried out a Connectivity Map analysis and
identified doxycycline as a strong candidate. Here, we
demonstrate that doxycycline inhibits proliferation and
survival of DLBCL cells in vitro as well as tumor growth
of DLBCL cells xenografted in mice at concentrations
that may be achievable in human sera with a therapeutic
dose of the drug, identifying doxycycline as a potential
low-cost and safe therapeutic agent for DLBCL and
possibly other NHLs. Additionally, our work uncovers
CSN5 as a novel target of doxycycline and as a potential
target in DLBCL therapy.

Connectivity map analysis uncovers doxycycline
as an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling
To identify potential inhibitors of NF-κB signaling
that may be exploited as therapeutic agents for DLBCL
treatment, we queried the Connectivity Map with a set
of known NF-κB targets. Notably, among the top hit
compounds that potentially inhibit NF-κB signaling from
this analysis are members of the tetracycline family of
antibiotics, including doxycycline (Table 1).
To verify the observation from the Connectivity
Map analysis that doxycycline inhibits NF-κB target
gene expression, we examined the effect of doxycycline
treatment on NF-κB activation in DLBCL cell lines. While
short (less than 30 minutes) treatment with doxycycline had
no inhibitory effect on NF-κB activation in OCI-Ly10 cells
(data not shown), an ABC-DLBCL cell line that displays
constitutive NF-κB signaling [11, 13], incubation of these
cells with doxycycline for 12 hours decreased mRNA
levels of several NF-κB targets (Figure 1A), which had
been shown previously to be regulated by NF-κ B in these
cells (cyclin D2, EBI3 and IκBα) [13, 14], or exhibited
the greatest response to doxycycline treatment among the
queried NF-κB targets in the cMAP database (MCL-1).
The decreases in these mRNAs likely resulted from
an inhibition of NF-κB signaling, rather than the
consequence of cell death, as the cell viability was not
affected by doxycycline at this time point (Figure 1B).
Doxycycline treatment also reduced NF-κB reporter
activity in OCI-Ly10 cells (Figure 1C) and the levels
of several proteins, known to be regulated by NF-κB
(Figure 1D). Moreover, doxycycline treatment of
ABC-DLBCL cells resulted in a reduction in IKK
phosphorylation and nuclear levels of the NF-κB
subunits p65 and c-Rel (Figure 1E and 1F),
characteristics of inhibition of NF-κB signaling [28, 29].
In addition to inhibiting constitutive NF-κB signaling,

Doxycycline inhibits tumor growth of ABC and
GCB DLBCL cells

doxycycline inhibited signal-induced NF-κB activation
in GCB-DLBCL cell lines (Figure 1G), which exhibit
minimum constitutive NF-κB activity [11, 13].
Together, these results confirm our observation from
the Connectivity Map analysis that doxycycline inhibits
NF-κB signaling.

To investigate whether doxycycline inhibits DLBCL
tumor growth in vivo, we examined the effect of doxycycline
on the tumor growth of OCI-Ly7 and OCI-Ly10 cells
implanted into immunodeficient mice. The tumor-bearing
mice were injected intraperitoneally either with saline as a
control or with doxycycline at a dose that was suggested to
result in a serum concentration of doxycycline similar to that
found in the sera of human patients given the standard dose
of the drug [25, 39]. While the administration of doxycycline
had no effect on the body weight of the treated mice (Figure
3A and 3B), doxycycline treatment significantly inhibited
DLBCL tumor growth (Figure 3C and 3D). We measured
the concentrations of doxycycline in the mouse sera 3 hours
after the last drug administration and found that the serum
doxycycline concentrations varied from 2.3 μg/ml to 5.5
μg/ml in the drug-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 1).
These results suggest that doxycycline inhibits DLBCL
tumor growth xenografted in mice at concentrations that
may be potentially achievable in patient sera with a clinically
relevant drug dose.

Doxycycline inhibits the proliferation and
survival of DLBCL cells in vitro
Since ABC-DLBCL cells depend on constitutive
NF-κB signaling for proliferation and survival [11, 13–15],
our observation that doxycycline inhibits NF-κB signaling
predicts the drug would inhibit the growth of these cells.
Indeed, doxycycline treatment for over 24 hours inhibited
the growth of ABC-DLBCL cell lines (Figure 2A and 2C,
and data not shown). Notably, doxycycline also inhibited
the growth of multiple GCB-DLBCL cell lines (Figure 2A
and 2C), which do not rely on NF-κB signaling for growth
in vitro [11, 13–15], suggesting that doxycycline affects
other pathways in addition to NF-κB signaling.
As primary DLBCL cells may have different
requirements for growth than established cell lines,
we examined the effect of doxycycline on the survival
of primary DLBCL samples. The viability of primary
DLBCL cells was also inhibited by doxycycline, indicating
that the cytotoxic effect of doxycycline is not limited to
the established cell lines (Figure 2B and 2C).
We also examined the effects of doxycycline on the
growth of other types of B-lymphoma cells. We found
that the growth of Burkitt lymphoma (Daudi and Ramos)
and mantle cell lymphoma (Granta, JEKO-1, Mino and
Rec-1) cells were also inhibited by doxycycline at similar
concentrations observed for DLBCL cells (Figure 2D and
2E), suggesting that doxycycline inhibits the growth of a
broad range of aggressive B-lymphoma cells in culture.
The average peak concentration of doxycycline
in human serum is 3–6 μg/ml with a single dose of 200
mg/day, and the peak concentration can be higher with
multiple dosing [30–33]. As the elimination half-life of
doxycycline in human serum is about 20 hours [34, 35],
our results thus suggest that growth of the lymphoma
cells in vitro is inhibited by a level of doxycycline that
is maintained in the sera of human patients receiving a
normal dose of the drug.
To investigate the effects of doxycycline on cell
proliferation and/or survival, we examined cell cycle
distribution and apoptosis of DLBCL cells following drug
exposure. Doxycycline treatment resulted in a reduction of
DLBCL cells in S phase and an accumulation of cells in
G1 phase (Figure 2F), indicating that doxycycline inhibits
cell cycle progression of DLBCL cells. Doxycycline
also increased apoptosis of DLBCL cells, as judged by a
doxycycline-induced increase in annexin V-positive cells
and an elevated cleavage of PARP (Figure 2G and 2H),
hallmarks of apoptosis [36–38]. Therefore, doxycycline
inhibits both proliferation and survival of DLBCL cells.

Doxycycline inhibits multiple signaling events in
DLBCL cells
It is unlikely that the growth inhibitory effect of
doxycycline on DLBCL cells results merely from the
inhibition of MMPs, as Prinomastat, a highly potent MMP
inhibitor with Ki values in the pM to nM range [40], only
exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth of DLBCL cell
at concentrations about 10, 000 times above the Ki values
of the compound (Supplementary Figure 2A). Moreover,
expression of several proteins such as MCL-1 and MMP9,
shown to be inhibited by doxycycline in DLBCL cells, was
unaffected by high concentrations of Prinomastat in these
cells (Supplementary Figure 2B). Therefore, we set out to
identify the target(s) of doxycycline in DLBCL cells that
might be relevant to the observed growth-inhibitory effect
of the drug. Since the expression of several NF-κB regulated
targets such as MCL-1 and MYC is also regulated by the
signal transducer and transcription factor 3 (STAT3) [41],
and since there is potent cooperation between NF-κB and
STAT3 signaling [42, 43], we investigated the possibility
that doxycycline may inhibit STAT3 signaling. STAT3
activity is critically regulated by two phosphorylation
events. Phosphorylation of tyrosine-705 is required for
STAT3 dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation,
while phosphorylation of serine-727 positively regulates
STAT3 transcriptional activity [44, 45]. Interestingly,
phosphorylation of both tyrosine-705 and serine-727 of
STAT3 was inhibited by doxycycline in OCI-Ly10 cells
(Figure 4A). Additionally, doxycycline treatment reduced the
nuclear levels of STAT3 protein in DLBCL cells (Figure 4B).
Thus, doxycycline also inhibits STAT3 activation in DLBCL
cells, apparently through more than one mechanism.

Doxycycline appears to affect HSP90 chaperone
function in DLBCL cells via an indirect
mechanism

Phosphorylation of tyrosine-705 of STAT3 is carried
out by members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, which
includes JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 [45]. Treatment
of OCI-Ly10 cells with doxycycline for a short time
(4 hours) decreased the protein levels of JAK1, JAK2 and
TYK2 at varying degrees (Figure 4C). STAT3 serine-727
phosphorylation can be mediated by different kinases,
including RIP1K and ERK, depending on cellular context
[46, 47]. As shown in Figure 4C and 4D, doxycycline
treatment inhibited both RIP1 expression and ERK
activation in DLBCL cells. Collectively, our results
suggest that doxycycline exhibits pleotropic effects in
DLBCL cells.

The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90
(HSP90) promotes the folding and function of a large number
of substrate proteins, referred to as HSP90 clients, many of
which are crucial regulators of diverse cellular functions [48–
50]. Dysregulation of HSP90 expression and activity has been
observed in a variety of cancers including DLBCL [51, 52].
HSP90 inhibitors can induce proliferation arrest and apoptosis
in DLBCL cells [53, 54]. Inhibition of HSP90 activity in
cancer cells results in degradation of client proteins, such as

TYK2 and RIPK1, and reduction in NF-κB signaling, STAT3
phosphorylation and ERK activation [55–60], the changes seen
in DLBCL cells treated with doxycycline (Figures 1 and 4).
We therefore investigated the possibility that doxycycline
might affect HSP90 chaperone function. Similar to the effects
of HSP90 inhibitors, doxycycline treatment decreased the
levels of several known HSP90 client proteins in DLBCL
cells (Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure 3A and 4A), while
such treatment had no inhibitory effect on the mRNA levels
of these proteins (Supplementary Figure 5A). Doxycycline
treatment also resulted in reduction of HSP90 client proteins
in other types of NHL cells (Supplementary Figure 3A).

Moreover, as observed with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG,
doxycycline treatment led to a decrease of the RIPK1 protein
in OCI-Ly10 cells, but not in OCI-Ly7 cells (Figure 5A and
Supplementary Figure 4A). Thus, doxycycline treatment
exhibits similar pleotropic and cell-type specific effects as
HSP90 inhibitors [61]. Taken together, our results suggest that
doxycycline affects HSP90 function.
One class of HSP90 inhibitors, which have been
most extensively studied, interact with the nucleotide
pocket at the N-terminus of HSP90 and interfere with
the conformational changes required for normal HSP90
chaperone function [48]. To test whether doxycycline acts

on HSP90 in a similar fashion as these HSP90 inhibitors,
we examined whether doxycycline affects the nucleotide
pocket of HSP90, using HSP90 binding to GA-beads
as the readout [62]. We found that doxycycline has no
inhibitory effect on binding of HSP90 to the GA-beads
(Supplementary Figure 4C), indicating that doxycycline
may affect HSP90 function through a mechanism other than
a direct binding to the HSP90 nucleotide pocket. In contrast
to the nucleotide pocket-binding HSP90 inhibitors, which
increase expression of HSP70 ( [48, 63], and Supplementary
Figure 4B), doxycycline treatment resulted in a decrease in
the levels of HSP70 protein (Figure 5B and Supplementary
Figure 3A), further suggesting that doxycycline acts
differently than the N-terminal HSP90 inhibitors.
Notably, doxycycline treatment also caused a
reduction in the levels of HSP90 protein (Figure 5B and
Supplementary Figure 3A), indicating that doxycycline acts
differently than common HSP90 inhibitors, which in general
have no effect on the levels of HSP90 protein. Prior to the
decrease in HSP90 protein, an increase in ubiquitination
of HSP90 was observed following doxycycline treatment
(Figure 5C and 5D), suggesting that the reduction of this
protein may result from proteasome degradation. The
modification of HSP90 as well as the reduction in the
levels of HSP70 and HSP90 protein may contribute to
the decreased HSP90 function in DLBCL cells. Thus,
doxycycline appears to interfere with HSP90 function
through an indirect mechanism. Similarly, reduction in the
levels of HSP70, HSP90 and HSP90 client proteins were
also observed in the xenografted DLBCL tumors treated
with doxycycline (Supplementary Figure 3B), suggesting
that doxycycline may inhibit DLBCL cell growth through
similar mechanism(s) in vitro and in vivo.

E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) through deneddylation of
cullin proteins, a change of CSN5 activity will likely affect
protein ubiquitination in the cells [70, 71]. Therefore, we
examined the effect of doxycycline on the activity of CSN5.
We developed an in vitro assay in which deneddylation
of Cullin-1 in the SCFSkp2 complex by the purified CSN
complex is assessed. In this in vitro system, doxycycline
inhibited CSN5 catalyzed-deneddylation with an IC50 about
110 μM (Figure 6A).
To investigate the specificity of doxycycline
inhibition among the members of the JAMM family, we
examined the effects of doxycycline on the activities
of Rpn11 (Poh1) and ASMH in vitro. In contrast to the
inhibition of CSN5, doxycycline had no inhibitory effect
on the activity of Rpn11 up to 10 mM concentration
(Figure 6B), nor did it inhibit the activity of AMSH at a
concentration up to 500 μM (Figure 6C). The inhibition
of AMSH activity seen at 1mM concentration likely
resulted from precipitation caused by the high level of
doxycycline in the reaction mixture, rather than from
a specific enzymatic inhibition. Thus, doxycycline
selectively inhibits CSN5, instead of being a general
inhibitor of the JAMM family, likely through a
mechanism more than mere zinc chelation.

Doxycycline accumulates in DLBCL cells and
inhibits CSN5 function in these cells
We observed significant growth inhibition of
DLBCL cells at doxycycline concentrations below 6
μg/ml (approximately 12 μM) (Figure 2). The fact that
doxycycline inhibited CSN5 activity significantly in vitro
only at relatively high drug concentrations (IC50: ~110
μM) thus raised the question whether the concentrations of
doxycycline in the DLBCL cells under our experimental
conditions were sufficient to inhibit CSN5 activity.
To address the issue, we measured the doxycycline
concentration in DLBCL cells treated with the drug.
Notably, doxycycline was enriched in DLBCL cells up to
more than 40 fold, compared to the drug concentrations
added initially to the medium (Figure 6D). Therefore,
the cellular concentrations of doxycycline under the
experimental conditions reached a level sufficient to
inhibit CSN5 activity in the DLBCL cells.
To investigate whether doxycycline indeed inhibits
the activity of CSN5 in DLBCL cells, we examined the
effect of doxycycline treatment on cullin neddylation. We
previously showed that neddylation of cullin proteins causes
a mobility shift that can be detected on western blots and
that loss of CSN5 function leads to an increase in neddylated
cullin proteins [72, 73]. We thus used this assay to assess
the effect of doxycycline on CSN5 activity. Doxycycline
treatment resulted in an increase in the neddylated (slowermigrating) forms of Cullin-1 and Cullin-2 in the DLBCL
cells (Figure 6E and Supplementary Figure 6), indicating
that doxycycline inhibits CSN5 activity in DLBCL cells.

Doxycycline inhibits CSN5 activity in vitro
In addition to increased ubiquitination of HSP90, we
frequently detected small increases in total cellular protein
ubiquitination in DLBCL cells treated with doxycycline
(Supplementary Figure 5B). These observations led us
to consider the possibility that doxycycline may target a
molecule that regulates the levels of protein ubiquitination.
Interestingly, members of the zinc-dependent JAMM family
of metalloproteinases are deubiquitinating or deneddylating
enzymes that play important roles in various cellular
processes [64–68]. Given that doxycycline is a known
zinc chelator and inhibits MMPs through chelating the
essential zinc ions of these enzymes [23], it is possible that
doxycycline may inhibit JAMM family metalloproteinases
through a similar mechanism. Among the six characterized
members of the JAMM family, CSN5 functions as a
deneddylating enzyme in the COP-9 signalosome (CSN)
complex [69], while the other members of the family are
deubiquitinating enzymes that preferentially cleave lysine
63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Because the CSN complex
regulates the activities of a large number of cullin-RING

Figure 6: Doxycycline inhibits the deneddylase activity of CSN5 in vitro and in DLBCL cells. A. Doxycycline inhibits

CSN5 deneddylase activity in vitro. SCFSkp2 conjugated with Oregon Green-labeled Nedd8 (5 nM) was incubated with purified CSN
complex (0.14 nM) at 30°C in the presence of different concentrations of doxycycline (5000 μM, 2000 μM, 800 μM, 320 μM, 128 μM,
51.2 μM, 20.48 μM, and 8.192 μM). Deconjugation of Nedd8 was monitored by a decrease in fluorescence polarization using a Pherastar
fluorescence plate reader over 40 minutes. Initial reaction rates at different concentrations of doxycycline were estimated from the
progress curves to determine the percent of activity remaining, which is plotted against doxycycline concentration. B. Doxycycline
has no inhibitory effect on Rpn11 activity in vitro. 5 nM model substrate Ub4-pepOG was incubated with 3 nM 26S proteasome in the
presence of the indicated concentrations of doxycycline at 30°C. The polarization was monitored using a Pherastar fluorescence plate
reader for 40 minutes. The rate of deubiquitination (Rpn11 activity) is determined by linear regression of the polarization value and
normalize to the DMSO control. C. The effect of doxycycline on AMSH activity in vitro. Purified AMSH was incubated with K63-linked
tetra-ubiquitin (Ub4) in the presence of the indicated concentrations of doxycycline. The reaction products were analyzed by western
blotting using a ubiquitin-specific antibody. D. Accumulation of doxycycline in DLBCL cells. OCI-Ly7 and OCI-Ly10 cells were
cultured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of doxycycline for 4 hrs. The doxycycline amount in the cells was determined
by mass spectrometry. The intracellular doxycycline concentrations were calculated based on the cell diameters of 17.1 μm and 13.9
μm for OCI-Ly7 and OCI-Ly10 cell, respectively. E. Effect of doxycycline treatment on neddylation of cullin proteins in DLBCL cells.
OCI-Ly7 (left panels) and OCI-Ly10 (right panels) cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of doxycycline for 30 minutes.
The cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Cullin-1 and Cullin-2, respectively. Analysis of cells treated with
MLN4924, a specific inhibitor of the Nedd8-activating enzyme (NAE), was included to confirm the identities of the slow-migrating
forms of the Cullin proteins. F. Doxycycline treatment increases protein neddylation in DLBCL cells. DLBCL cells were treated as
described in (E). The cell lysates were subject to western blot analysis with an anti-NEDD8 antibody. Analysis of OCI-Ly10 cells treated
with MLN4924 was included as an antibody specificity control.

We also examined the effect of doxycycline on
neddylation using a NEDD8-specific antibody, which
recognizes neddylated proteins in the 80–95 kDa range
[74]. Doxycycline treatment increased protein neddylation
in DLBCL cells (Figure 6F and Supplementary Figure 6).
Collectively, the results support the idea that doxycycline
inhibits CSN5 function in cultured DLBCL cells.

DLBCL cells through inhibition of CSN5. This view
predicts that CSN5 is required for the survival of DLBCL
cells. To test this predication, we examined the effects of
CSN5 knockdown in DLBCL cells. Depletion of CSN5
led to marked increases in DLBCL cell death (Figure 7A),
demonstrating that CSN5 is an essential survival factor for
DLBCL cells. As observed with doxycycline treatment,
CSN5 knockdown resulted in reduction in the levels
of several HSP90 client proteins as well as HSP70 and
HSP90 proteins in both DLBCL cells (Figure 7B) and
non-lymphoma cells (Supplementary Figure 7). Thus,
CSN5 depletion exhibits the biological and biochemical
effects shown for doxycycline treatment in DLBCL cells,

Knockdown of CSN5 impairs the survival of
DLBCL cells
The observations presented above suggest that
doxycycline may exert its growth inhibitory effect on

of the antineoplastic action of doxycycline in DLBCL cells.

xenografted in mice [75]. This study employed six-fold
lower doxycycline dosage than what was used in our study.
Achieving sufficient in vivo concentrations of doxycycline will
thus be critical for effective inhibition of lymphoma growth.
Our preclinical studies presented here suggest
that doxycycline has antineoplastic activity in DLBCL,
as well as in several other types of NHL. Remarkably,
doxycycline inhibited growth of all tested DLBCL cells,
including cells that are resistant to several currently-tested
inhibitors that target HSP90 or the upstream regulators
of the BCR signaling pathway in B-cell lymphomas
[53, 76]. As doxycycline interferes with the survival
pathways in DLBCL cells, it may sensitize the cancer cells
to chemotherapy agents. Indeed, we have observed that
doxycycline exhibited cooperative cytotoxic effects on
DLBCL cells with several chemotherapeutic agents (data
not shown). These observations, together with the fact
that doxycycline is concentrated in lymphoma cells, raise
the possibility that doxycycline may represent a safe and
inexpensive drug for NHL therapy either as a single agent
or, given the minimal toxicity profile, in combination with
standard chemotherapy or rationally targeted agents.
Our results suggest that doxycycline exhibits
anti-DLBCL activities in vitro and in mouse xenograft
models at concentrations that may be achievable in the
blood of patients receiving a therapeutic dose of the
drug. It should be noted, however, that human cancer in
a clinical setting may respond differently than cultured
cancer cells or mouse models to the treatment of a drug.
Whether doxycycline has therapeutic efficacy in DLBCL
patients needs to be tested in clinical studies. Based on our
observations, a clinical trail of single agent doxycycline
for patients with relapsed or refractory NHL is now
ongoing (NCT02086591).

DISCUSSION
This work demonstrates that doxycycline accu­
mulates in DLBCL cells and exhibits potent growth
inhibitory activity towards DLBCL cells both in vitro and
in mouse xenograft models. In addition, we show that
doxycycline affects several oncogenic signaling pathways,
including the NF-κB, STAT3, ERK and AKT pathways,
critical for lymphomagenesis in DLBCL cells. Moreover,
the present study identified the deneddylating activity
of the COP-9 signalosome CSN5, which is essential for
DLBCL cell survival, as a novel target of doxycycline.
Together, our results suggest that doxycycline may
represent a potential therapeutic agent for DLBCL.
Inhibition of CSN5 deneddylating activity by
doxycycline may cause downstream effects through
several pathways. Our data suggest that HSP90 levels and
function are affected as a result of impairment of CSN5
activity, which may in turn affects downstream oncogenic
signaling pathways. As neddylation plays a key role in
the regulation of the activities of the CRL E3 ubiquitin
ligases, the effects of doxycycline in the lymphoma cells
may also result from perturbations in the functions of these
enzymes. Additionally, inhibition of CSN5 may affect
the function of signaling molecules whose activities are
regulated by direct protein neddylation.
Alternatively, given that DLBCL cells accumulates
doxycycline to such high concentrations (Figure 6D),
it may be possible that doxycycline acts in these cells
through additional targets independent of CSN5, although
our data are inconsistent with the idea that MMP inhibition
is responsible for the growth inhibition by doxycycline
in these cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Regardless of
whether doxycycline may have additional targets in
DLBCL cells, our work presented here indicates that
CSN5 is a critical target of doxycycline in DLBCL cells.
In addition, our work suggests that CSN5 may represent a
potential therapeutic target in DLBCL.
How doxycycline exerts its non-antibiotic activities
in human diseases has not been fully elucidated, although
in some cases this has been attributed to the ability of
doxycycline to inhibit the expression and activities of
MMPs and inflammation. In addition, the mechanisms
underlying the inhibition of MMP expression and
inflammation by doxycycline have not been identified.
As NF-κB and STAT3 are major transcriptional regulators
of MMPs and inflammatory cytokines, our findings that
doxycycline treatment impairs the activation of NF-κB
and STAT3 provide new insights into mechanisms of
doxycycline action in human diseases.
In a brief communication published previously, it was
reported that doxycycline injected intraperitoneally at a dosage
of 25 mg/kg/day failed to inhibit the tumor growth of DLBCL

NF-κB-luciferase reporter OCI-Ly10 cell line
The NF-κB reporter OCI-Ly10 cell line was
generously provided by Dr. John Aston (University of
Rochester). The cells carry a stably integrated firefly
luciferase reporter under the control of 5 copies of the
NF-κB response element (Invitrogen). The cells exhibit
high basal luciferase activity, responding to both NF-κB
activating (such as TNFα and PMA) and inhibiting (IKK
inhibitors) factors.

Analyses of cell viability, apoptosis and cell
proliferation

OCI-Ly10 cells, plated at 3 × 105 cell/ml, were
treated with doxycycline for the indicated times. Total
RNA from the cells was isolated and treated with DNase I
using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Standard reverse transcriptase
reactions were carried out using reagents from Invitrogen
following the manufacturer’s suggestion. Two-Step
Quantitative PCR reactions with SYBR Green were
performed in triplicate on a Bio-Rad MyIQ thermalcycler.
For quantitation, expression of each gene was normalized
to the level of RhoA. The normalized mRNA levels in
the cells not treated with doxycycline were set as 1. The
following primer sets were used for the PCR reactions:
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Primers

Cells were plated in triplicates at a concentration
of 2–3 × 105 cells/ml. Doxycycline (dissolved in sterile
water) was added into the culture medium, and the
cells were incubated at 37°C. Forty-eight hours after
incubation, an equal volume of fresh medium with the
original concentrations of doxycycline was added. Cell
viability was measured by Trypan blue exclusion assay
[77]. Apoptosis was assayed as previously described
[82]. Analysis of the cell-cycle distribution was carried
out essentially as described previously [83], except
that 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) was used in

extraction and mass spectrometry analysis were carried
out as described above for the analysis of serum samples.
For preparation of the standard curves, cell lysates (40 μl
each), prepared from the same numbers of the cells as in
the cell samples (4.6–5 × 106 cells) by hypotonic buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0 and 10 mM KCl) treatment and
homogenizing in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer,
were spiked with varying amounts of doxycycline. The
extraction and mass spectrometry analysis were then
carried out as described for cell samples. The data obtained
were used to generate the standard curves.
For calculating the intracellular doxycycline
concentrations, we determined the volume of the tested
cells. The diameters of the cells were measured using a
Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope equipped with
an eyepiece grid reticle. The cell volumes were calculated
using the formula: V = 4 π/3 × r3, where r is the radius of
the cells.

In vivo xenograft studies
All animal experiments were performed with
protocols approved by our Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Seven-week-old female NSG
mice (Stock#: 005557, The Jackson Laboratory) were
subcutaneously injected with OCI-Ly7 cells (5 × 106)
and OCI-Ly10 cells (3 × 106), respectively. When tumors
were palpable (40–85 mm3), the tumor-bearing mice
were randomized and injected intraperitoneally once
daily with either sterile saline as controls or doxycycline
prepared in saline. The animals were given a doxycycline
dose of 95 mg/kg/day for the first two days. Then a dose
of 150 mg/kg/day was administered afterwards. The
tumor size was measured with a digital caliper, and
tumor volumes were calculated according to the formula
[84]: tumor volume = π/6 × (length) × (width) × (height).
Statistic significance of the difference was analyzed by
standard student t test.

In vitro activity assays for CSN5, RPN11 and
AMSH
Purification of CSN and generation of Nedd8conjugated SCFSkp2 substrate have been previously
described [85]. CSN-mediated deneddylation was
measured by monitoring a decrease in fluorescence
polarization upon deconjugation of fluorescent Nedd8
from SCFskp2 (PubChem Bioassay AID651999). A
detailed characterization of the assay is being prepared for
publication elsewhere.
The Rpn11 assay is described in PubChem (AID
588493).
The in vitro de-ubiquitination activity of AMSH
was assayed essentially as previously described [67].
Briefly, GST-AMSH protein was purified from E. coli
BL21 cells that harbor the pGEX-AMSH plasmid [67],
kindly provided by Dr. Sylvie Urbe, using the method
previously described [86]. The purified GST-AMSH
was incubated with K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin (Boston
Biochem) in the DUB buffer with or without the
presence of doxycycline at 37°C for 4 hr. The reactions
were terminated with the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and
the products were analyzed by western blotting with an
anti-ubiquitin antibody.

Measurement of doxycycline concentrations
For measuring doxycycline concentrations in
mice sera, mice were sacrificed 3 hours after the last
administration of doxycycline. Blood was collected
by cardiac puncture and incubated at 4°C for 2 hours.
The sera were obtained by centrifugation as previously
describe [78] and stored at −80°C until analysis. The
serum samples (15 μl) were mixed with 10 volumes of
acetonitrile in the Eppendorf LoBind tubes and vortexed
for 2 minutes at room temperature. The samples were
centrifuged at 18, 000 g for 5 minutes. The supernatants
were collected and dried down under a steam of nitrogen
or in a Speed Vac. The dried samples were dissolved in
50% methanol, centrifuged (18, 000 g, 2 minutes) to
remove any debris if necessary and analyzed by liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
at the University of Rochester Proteomics Center. For
calculation of extraction efficiencies, sera from untreated
mice were spiked with appropriate amounts of doxycycline
and processed as described for the doxycycline-containing
serum samples.
For measuring intracellular concentrations of
doxycycline, cells (3–3.3 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated
with various concentrations of doxycycline for 4
hours. The cells (4.6–5 × 106 cells) were collected by
centrifugation at 320 g for 3 minutes. The cell pellets
were quickly washed once with 1.4 ml culture medium,
collected by centrifugation at 1500g for 2 minute, frozen
in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at −80°C until
analysis. The volume of each cell sample was brought to
40 μl with a solution of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 10
mM KCl, and mixed with 10 volumes of acetonitrile. The
