Abstract
Intimal sarcoma (IS) is a rare, malignant, and aggressive tumor that shows a relentless course with a concomitant low survival rate and for which no effective treatment is available. In this study, 21 cases of large
arterial blood vessel IS were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization and
selectively by karyotyping, array comparative genomic hybridization, sequencing, phospho-kinase antibody arrays, and Western immunoblotting in search for novel diagnostic markers and potential molecular therapeutic
targets. Ex vivo immunoassays were applied to test the sensitivity of IS primary tumor cells to the receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib. We showed that amplification of platelet-derived
growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) is a common finding in IS, which should be considered as a molecular
hallmark of this entity. This amplification is consistently associated with PDGFRA activation. Furthermore,
the tumors reveal persistent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), concurrent to PDGFRA
activation. Activated PDGFRA and EGFR frequently coexist with amplification and overexpression of the
MDM2 oncogene. Ex vivo immunoassays on primary IS cells from one case showed the potency of dasatinib
to inhibit PDGFRA and downstream signaling pathways. Our findings provide a rationale for investigating
therapies that target PDGFRA, EGFR, or MDM2 in IS. Given the clonal heterogeneity of this tumor type and
the potential cross-talk between the PDGFRA and EGFR signaling pathways, targeting multiple RTKs and aberrant downstream effectors might be required to improve the therapeutic outcome for patients with this
disease. Cancer Res; 70(18); 7304–14. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
It is well established that platelet-derived growth factors
(PDGF) are involved in several pathologic settings, including tumor growth (1, 2). PDGFs bind to two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), PDGF receptor-α (PDGFRA) and PDGF

receptor-β (PDGFRB), which activate the receptor kinases
and initiate a number of signaling pathways, including the
RAS/extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2),
phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT and protein kinase C pathways. The cellular responses to PDGF signaling involve proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation. In mouse
models, elevated PDGFRA activation leads to connective tissue hyperplasia, progressive chronic fibrosis in many organs,
and sarcomagenesis (3). In humans, aberrant PDGFR signaling has been associated with a number of malignancies (4).
In sarcomas, several types of genetic alterations, including
gene amplification, translocations, and activating mutations,
result in ligand and/or receptor overexpression (5). These
aberrations may lead to dysregulated activity of PDGFRA/B.
The activating mutations of PDGFRA in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST) and the overexpression of PDGFB
due to a unique COL1A1-PDGFB fusion in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans serve as examples (6, 7). Imatinib mesylate, the inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL,
which also targets PDGFRA/B, proved to be very effective for
the treatment of both conditions (8, 9). There are several reports on PDGFRA amplifications in solid tumors, such as
glioblastomas (10, 11), anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (12),
and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (13).

PDGFRA and EGFR as Targets in Intimal Sarcoma

Intimal sarcoma (IS) is a rare, lethal mesenchymal tumor
arising in the large arteries, mainly the pulmonary artery
and the aorta. Presumably, these sarcomas develop from
the subendothelial cells of the blood vessel wall located in
the intima (14). The defining feature is the predominant intraluminal growth with obstruction of the lumen of the vessel of
origin and embolic tumor dissemination (15). On histology, IS
usually displays features of a poorly differentiated sarcoma,
composed of spindle cells, with varying degrees of atypia, mitotic activity, nuclear polymorphisms, and necrosis (16). Some
tumors may show considerable heterogeneity in terms of extracellular matrix and tumor cell composition. Large myxoid
regions or an epithelioid component can be observed, as well
as areas of rhabdomyo-, angio-, or osteosarcomatous differentiation (17–21). Angiosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma are the
most important entities that have to be included in the differential diagnosis. The clinical presentation of IS is often not
specific and related to tumor emboli (15). Pulmonary IS behaves very aggressively on site, conferring lung infiltrations
in 40% of the patients (22, 23). Aortic IS mostly arises in the
abdominal aorta. Arterial embolic tumor dissemination might
result in distant metastases involving the bone, peritoneum,
liver, and mesenteric lymph nodes (15). The prognosis of IS is
poor, with a mean survival time of about 12 months (24).
To date, the understanding of the histogenesis and molecular mechanisms leading to the development of IS remains
fragmentary. In recent years, recurrent molecular genetic
events associated with IS development have been reported
based on the analysis of a few cases. By comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH), recurrent amplification of the regions
4q12 and 12q13-q15 was described in a subset of IS (25). Amplification of the chromosomal region 12q13-q15 was reported
in 75% of these tumors (14, 25). Multiple genes in this region,
such as MDM2, SAS, CDK4, and GLI1, are frequently amplified
in many types of human cancer (14, 26). Notably, amplification
of the PDGFRA gene, which maps to chromosome 4q12, was
reported in 5 of 8 (62.5%) pulmonary artery IS (25). In a more
recent report, deregulated copy numbers of PDGFRA/PDGFRB,
KIT, and EGFR were described in seven examined IS cases, and
the activation of the PDGFRs and EGFR has been disclosed by
biochemical assays in one of these IS cases (24).
Due to the rareness of IS, these lesions have been a neglected area and there is a lack of specific biomarkers. The
therapy is currently limited to surgery (23). In this study, we
aimed to identify potential novel diagnostic markers and
molecular targets for the treatment of IS. To this aim, we
have performed an integrated histopathologic, cytogenetic,
molecular, and biochemical analysis of a large cohort of 21
cases with IS. In view of the clinical availability of several
therapeutic agents against RTKs, we have focused on the relevance of activation of RTKs in the pathobiology of IS and
on the inhibitory effect of RTK inhibitors on primary IS cells.

Materials and Methods
Patients and histopathology
The present study included 21 patients (11 females and 10
males; age range, 27–74 years; median age, 52 years; Table 1).

www.aacrjournals.org

The tumors were located in the pulmonary artery trunk
(n = 12), right or left pulmonary artery (n = 3), heart (n = 4),
femoral artery (n = 1), and splenic artery (n = 1), and one presented as a femoral embolus from the aorta primary site.
Histopathologic examination was performed on formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Five-micrometer sections
were used for routine H&E and immunohistochemical stainings (avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method), using the
following monoclonal (mc) and polyclonal (pc) antibodies:
α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; mc, 1/100; DAKO), desmin
(mc, 1/20; ICN), CD31 (mc, 1/50; DAKO), CD34 (mc, 1/10;
Becton Dickinson), MDM2 (mc, 1/100; Invitrogen, Life Technologies), CD117 (pc, 1/250; DAKO), EGFR (EGFR PharmDx
Kit, DAKO), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2; HercepTest, DAKO). EGFR and HER2 protein expression was reported as membranous brown staining of neoplastic cells using a three-tier system ranging from 1+ (weak
intensity) to 3+ (strong intensity).
Cytogenetic analysis
Karyotyping was performed on primary tumor cells from
three cases after 7 days in culture.
Array-CGH analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from eight frozen tumor tissues
using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche
Diagnostics). The Agilent Human Genome Microarray Kit
244A (Agilent Technologies) was used to perform arrayCGH (aCGH) analysis. Labeling, hybridization, washing, and
scanning were carried out in accordance with the protocols
provided by the manufacturer. The Agilent Feature Extraction
software (version 10.5.1.1) was used to process the images obtained from the scanner (Agilent DNA microarray scanner,
with up to 2-μm precision) and to generate a text file (FE file).
Subsequently, the FE files were analyzed using the Agilent
Genomic Workbench Standard Edition 5.0.14 software based
on the HG18 genome build. The ADM-2 algorithm was chosen for reporting copy number aberrations (CNA). Regions
with a log 2 ratio >2 were considered as amplified, and regions with a log 2 ratio <−1 were considered as homozygously
deleted. The data were submitted to the Gene Expression
Omnibus database (accession no. 15834535).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on all 21 cases as previously described (27). Pretreatment and enzyme digestion were done using the SPoT-Light
Tissue Pretreatment Kit (Invitrogen). Chromosome 4 and
PDGFRA copy numbers were determined by cohybridization
of Spectrum Green (SG)–labeled centromer-specific probe
CEP4 (Vysis, Inc., Abbott Laboratories) and Spectrum Orange
(SO)–labeled bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA
probe RP11-231C18, which maps to PDGFRA (Research Genetics). For evaluation of the integrity of PDGFRA, BAC probes
centromeric (RP11-3H20-SO) and telomeric (RP11-24O10-SG)
to the PDGFRA locus (both from Research Genetics) were
used. The coamplification of PDGFRA and MDM2 or EGFR
on a cellular level was determined by cohybridization of

PDGFRA/RP11-24O10-SG and EGFR/RP11-231C18-SO labeled
probes. The BAC DNA was isolated and labeled with fluorochrome dyes using standard techniques. Detection was performed as previously described (27). In addition, the MDM2,
EGFR, and HER2 gene copy numbers were investigated using
the double-color locus-specific identifier (LSI) MDM2-SO/
CEP12-SG (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Life Technologies),
LSI EGFR-SO/CEP7-SG (Vysis), and LSI HER2-SO/CEP17-SG
(Vysis) probes, respectively, according to the manufacturers'
recommendations. Slides were counterstained with 0.1 μmol/L
4,6-diaminido-2-phenylindole in an antifade solution and
viewed under a fluorescence microscope equipped with an
ISIS digital image analysis system (MetaSystems). Signal copy
numbers were counted from 100 nonoverlapping nuclei from
at least three different areas and the percentage of affected
nuclei was recorded. Chromosome polysomy was defined as
>4 gene signals per nucleus paralleled by similar increases in
chromosome centromere signals in at least 10% of tumor cells.
A gene/CEP ratio of >2 in at least 10% of tumor cells was

RTK activation profiling
The expression and activation of RTKs and their downstream signaling pathways were analyzed using the Proteome
Profiler Array kits (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol and using 500 μg of protein lysate per array.
The images were captured and the level of RTK activation was
densitometrically quantified with AIDA software (TBC Software, Inc.). The intensity values of the probes and the local
background of the probes were log 2 transformed to obtain
a more symmetrical distribution, and the difference between
these two resulted in a log 2 transformed ratio (further referred to as log 2 intensity ratios). Subsequently, the mean of
the log 2 intensity ratios for each kinase within an array was
calculated. Probes with a log 2 intensity ratio higher than the
mean plus SD were considered as significantly activated.

PDGFRA and EGFR as Targets in Intimal Sarcoma

GIST882 (28) and SQD9 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines
(29) were incorporated as controls. Cell lysis, SDS-PAGE,
and immunoblotting were carried out as previously described (30). Membranes were immunoblotted sequentially
using rabbit antibodies against phospho-EGFR (Tyr845;
R&D Systems), total EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
phospho-PDGFRA (Tyr754; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), total
PDGFRA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell
Signaling), total ERK1/2 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies),
phospho-AKT (Cell Signaling), total AKT (Cell Signaling),
and total actin (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted in 5% blocking reagent. The horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antirabbit
IgGs were used for enhanced chemiluminescence visualization (Thermo Scientific).
Ex vivo assay
Primary cells from a collagenase-disaggregated tumor
specimen from case no. 1 were used for the cell cultures,
as previously described (31). In short, cells were grown for
3 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
MITO+ serum extender (used according to the manufacturer's recommendation; BD Biosciences), 30 μg/mL bovine
pituitary extract (BD Biosciences), 0.1 mmol/L nonessential
amino acids, and 1.0 mmol/L sodium pyruvate. Cells were
exposed to imatinib, dasatinib, or vehicle alone for 2 hours
at 37°C. After a wash in ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed and
used for Western immunoblotting as described above.
Compounds
The inhibitors imatinib (Glivec/Gleevec, Novartis) and
dasatinib (BMS-354825, Bristol-Myers Squibb) were provided
by MedImmune, Inc. The inhibitors were diluted in culture
medium directly before use.

Results
Histopathology
On histology, the tumors showed a variable morphology,
ranging from spindle cell proliferations with variable cellularity to islands of high anaplastic pleomorphic tumor cells
with atypical mitotic figures (Supplementary Fig. S1). Lowgrade– and high-grade–appearing areas were simultaneously
present in all tumors. The matrix was usually collagenous,
but on occasion was very myxoid; in one case, osteoid production was observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed focal
and weak expression of CD31, CD34, and desmin in 10% to
20% of cases (Table 1). About half of the tumors investigated
were α-SMA positive. EGFR was expressed in all but one
case, although the staining pattern was heterogeneous,
from strongly diffuse (3+; n = 6) to intermediate (2+; n = 7)
or low and focal (1+; n = 7). MDM2 staining was positive in
52% of examined cases. CD117 (KIT) expression was rare
and occurred in only two tumors mainly as focal and weak
staining.
Karyotype analysis
All three IS tumors featured a polyploid range of chromosome number and complex structural rearrangements, with

www.aacrjournals.org

the presence of homogeneously staining regions within unidentified markers in two cases (nos. 1 and 4) and double
minutes in the third case (no. 19; data not shown).
aCGH study
Using high-resolution oligonucleotide aCGH, we studied
CNAs in eight cases for which frozen tissue was available.
There was a median of 64 gains (range, 36–83) and 42 losses
(range, 13–63) per tumor. CNAs affecting six or more tumors
(≥75% of cases) were identified on chromosomes 3q, 4q, 7p,
8q, 9p, 10q, and 12q (Table 2; Fig. 1). Major segments of highlevel amplification were localized within chromosomes 1, 3,
4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 21, 22, and X (Supplementary Table S2). Six of
eight tumors showed chromosome 4q12 amplification, with
the common region (54.78–55.21 Mb) containing only the
PDGFRA gene (Fig. 2). The region at 12q15 (68.32–68.45
Mb) was amplified in 50% of the cases; the common region
of amplification encompassed the BEST3 gene (the encoded
protein is a Ca-activated Cl channel candidate in the development of vascular smooth muscle cells; ref. 32). Three chromosomal regions were amplified in 37.5% of cases, that is, the
chromosomal regions 12q14.1 (KUB3), 12q15 (67.43–67.79
Mb; containing MDM2, SLC35E3, and CPM genes), and
22q11.23 (GSTT1). Four additional regions, 8p11.23-p11.22,
12q13.3-q14, 12q14.2-q14.3, and Xp21.1, were amplified in
two cases each. Seventeen other amplified regions, which
harbor known cancer-related genes, were observed in single
cases.
Homozygous deletions were found on chromosomes 3, 5,
6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20, and 22 (Supplementary Table S2). The
homozygous deletions at 9p21.3-p21.2 (21.89–25.65 Mb), covering the CDKN2A/CDKN2B loci, were found in three of eight
tumors. In addition, loss of one copy of CDKN2A/CDKN2B
loci was revealed in three additional cases. This finding indicates that loss of CDKN2A/CDKN2B, although not tumor type
specific, may be important for IS development and/or progression. The three chromosomal sub-bands—3p26.2 (ITPR1),
3p14.1 (FOXP1), and 18q22.3 (FBXO15)—were homozygously
lost in two cases each. Twelve other homozygous deletions
were found in one case each, and some of these deletions
harbor known putative tumor suppressor genes.
FISH analysis
The eight tumors analyzed with 244A Agilent array and 13
additional paraffin-embedded IS were evaluated by FISH
(Table 1; Fig. 3) using specific probes for PDGFRA, EGFR,
MDM2, and HER2. The PDGFRA amplification was the most
prevalent change, found in 17 of 21 (81%) cases (Fig. 3A).
Notably, two tumors (nos. 2 and 7) that showed focal
PDGFRA amplification (from 12% to 18% affected cells) by
FISH did not reveal this amplification by the parallel aCGH
analysis (Figs. 2 and 3B). This finding indicates that the FISH
technique is more suitable than aCGH for detecting the focal
CNA in the context of cytogenetically heterogeneous and
polyploid tumors. Three other IS showed high-level polysomy
of PDGFRA, and only one case did not reveal any CNA of
PDGFRA. Importantly, none of the examined cases showed a
rearrangement of PDGFRA.

The MDM2 gene was amplified in a large subset of tumors
in our series (11 of 17 cases; 65%) and one case showed
MDM2 gene polysomy.
In total, 16 (76%) tumors showed either EGFR amplification (n = 2) or EGFR aneuploidy (n = 14). Additionally, the
status of the gene encoding HER2, a close family member

and an important dimerization partner of EGFR, was investigated. There was polysomy of HER2 in one case. By immunohistochemistry, strong EGFR-positive staining tended to
correlate with EGFR gene amplification and aneuploidy, suggesting that the amplified EGFR is transcribed and translated
to protein.

PDGFRA and EGFR as Targets in Intimal Sarcoma

Figure 2. A, representative CNA profile by 244A Agilent aCGH: case 4, case 2, and case 19. The individual array probes are arranged according to
their genomic location (X axis) and their respective tumor/reference log 2 ratios (Y axis). B, aCGH profiles by 244A Agilent of a selected region of
chromosome 4q12 (54.2–56.0 Mb). Case 4 and case 19 show a high level of amplification of this region, with the smallest common region of amplification
containing only the PDGFRA gene. The low level and focal amplification of PDGFRA in case 2, as identified by FISH (Fig. 3B), is not detected by aCGH.

In the subsequent step of FISH analysis, we have explored
the colocalization of PDGFRA, EGFR, and MDM2 amplicons
on a cellular level in three cases (nos. 1, 4, and 19). Coamplification of PDGFRA with MDM2 or EGFR was observed as
partially overlapping large-clustered amplicons and/or as
multiple, scattered signals (Fig. 3C and D). Interestingly, subpopulations of tumor cells with mutual or exclusive amplification of PDGFRA and MDM2 or EGFR coexisted in each of
the examined specimens.
Mutation analysis
No activating mutations were identified in PDGFRA/B and
EGFR in the six IS cases (nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, and 10) analyzed.
RTK phosphorylation profiling using phospho-RTK and
phospho-kinase antibody arrays
All seven analyzed tumors revealed strongly coactivated
PDGFRA and EGFR kinases (Fig. 4). Six cases concurrently
showed phosphorylation of PDGFRB. Four cases concomitantly showed low-level phosphorylation of EPHB2, and three
cases also had low-level phosphorylation of AXL. Strikingly,
there was no detectable activation of KIT or vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, nor activation of the mem-

bers of the SRC-family proteins. By analyzing the signaling
pathways (the profiles of 46 kinases and protein substrates),
CREB, eNOS, TP53, JUN, STAT5B, and AMPKα1 were found
to be the most frequently and strongest phosphorylated proteins (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 4).
The consistent protein expression and activation of
PDGFRA and EGFR were confirmed by Western immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. S2;
Table 1). By immunoblotting, both the AKT and ERK1/2
downstream signaling pathways were activated, the latter
to a much stronger level, which is in line with PDGFR/
EGFR–driven tumors (31, 33, 34).
Ex vivo biochemical assay using primary IS cells
We examined the consequences of PDGFRA inhibition
with imatinib and dasatinib in primary IS cultures from
case no. 1. Both inhibitors caused a dose-responsive decrease in PDGFRA phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Dasatinib completely blocked the phosphorylation of the target PDGFRA
at 0.1 μmol/L. In contrast, 0.5 μmol/L imatinib only slightly
affected PDGFRA activation, and 5.0 μmol/L imatinib was
needed to completely abrogate PDGFRA phosphorylation.
Hence, dasatinib inhibited PDGFRA at much lower (clinically

achievable) concentrations. Using p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 proteins as molecular surrogates of downstream RTK signaling,
we found that both the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways were activated in untreated IS primary cells. Importantly, although
PDGFRA activation was completely abolished with 5 μmol/L
imatinib, the downstream signaling pathways were still active.
In contrast, complete inactivation of PDGFRA was associated
with substantial inactivation of both ERK1/2 and AKT with
0.5 μmol/L dasatinib. This suggests that other dasatinib tar-

gets, next to PDGFRA, might be responsible for the inactivation of downstream ERK1/2 signaling by dasatinib.

Discussion
Using a variety of methodologic approaches, we aimed for
a comprehensive characterization of IS in search for relevant
diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

PDGFRA and EGFR as Targets in Intimal Sarcoma

Figure 5. Immunoblots showing the effect of the 2-h exposure of the primary IS cells to increasing doses of imatinib or dasatinib on the phosphorylation
of PDGFRA and the downstream effectors ERK1/2 and AKT. Actin served as a loading control. The lysates from the frozen tissue specimens, IS 1 (case 1)
and IS 2 (case 2), and from the GISTs carrying KITK642E (GIST_KIT mut.) or PDGFRAD561V (GIST_PDGFRA mut.) mutations were run in parallel as
control samples.

As expected, high-resolution 244A Agilent aCGH revealed
complex CNA in all examined cases across the genome,
including previously recognized oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, as well as completely novel loci. Most importantly, high-level amplifications or copy number gains
frequently involved chromosomal regions that contain the
PDGFRA, EGFR, and/or MDM2 genes.
Accordingly, PDGFRA amplification and high-level polysomy
by FISH were present in 81% and 15% of tumors, respectively. Remarkably, using high-resolution array, we were
able to delineate the common region of 4q12 amplification
to 54.78 to 55.21 Mb, containing only the PDGFRA locus.
Thus, PDGFRA is the most likely target for amplification
in IS. Our findings are comparable to the results reported
previously on smaller IS cohorts (24, 25). To the best of our
knowledge, no other sarcoma reported thus far presents
consistent PDGFRA amplification (35). Thus, given its specificity and high frequency of occurrence, the PDGFRA amplification in IS might be considered as a molecular hallmark
of the entity. Importantly, PDGFRA amplification, detected

www.aacrjournals.org

by FISH, is a valuable marker for IS diagnosis, distinguishing IS from the other undifferentiated sarcomas known to
reside in similar anatomic sites.
The amplification of the 12q15 region, harboring the
MDM2 locus, was another consistent and frequent feature revealed by aCGH. Amplification and consequent
upregulation of the MDM2 oncogene represent a recurrent molecular feature of many sarcomas, such as de-differentiated liposarcomas (36), and it was also reported in
IS (14, 24, 25). The extended FISH analysis revealed that
65% of tumors have MDM2 amplification in our cohort.
MDM2 amplification was closely correlated with the
protein expression of this oncogene, as evidenced by immunohistochemistry. Because the amplification or overexpression of MDM2 has been found in many cancers,
inhibiting MDM2 and thereby reactivating TP53 in cancer
cells is an emerging new therapeutic strategy. Nutlin-3 and
MI-219 are MDM2 inhibitors with desirable pharmacologic
properties and are in advanced preclinical development or
early-phase clinical trials (37). Interestingly, cancer cell

lines with MDM2 gene amplification were shown to be
more sensitive to Nutlin-3 than cell lines lacking this amplification (38).
The gain of chromosome 7p, encompassing the EGFR locus, was accounted for in six of eight cases analyzed by aCGH
in the present study. High-level EGFR aneuploidy (or rarely
amplification) was confirmed by FISH (76% of cases). EGFR
belongs to the ERBB family of RTKs, which recognize at least
11 known ligands (39, 40). There is ample evidence of amplified and activated forms of EGFR in many human cancers,
and drugs that specifically target EGFR show promise in
inhibiting the growth of certain tumor types (39). Sato and
colleagues showed that 168 of 281 (60%) adult soft tissue
sarcomas overexpressed EGFR (41); this overexpression significantly correlated with higher histologic grade, poorer survival, and chemoresistance. It is noteworthy that gefitinib, an
EGFR inhibitor, has shown potential antitumor effects in
several sarcoma cell lines when used in combination with
irinotecan (42).
To define the compendium of coactivated RTKs in IS,
we used an antibody array that allows simultaneous
assessment of the phosphorylation status of 42 RTKs. Of
utmost importance and coherent with the crucial biological role for the IS pathogenesis, the PDGFRA and EGFR
kinases were consistently activated in all seven investigated cases of our study. The PDGFRB kinase was activated
in a smaller subgroup of tumors. The coactivation of
multiple RTKs is not a distinctive feature of IS because
similar patterns were reported in other tumor types
(43–46). Importantly, the concomitant activation of multiple RTKs serves to reduce dependence on a single RTK
for the maintenance of critical downstream signaling
and, thus, renders such tumors refractory to single-agent
RTK inhibition.
The recurrent high-level amplification and strong activation of PDGFRA in absence of resistance mutations
prompted us to investigate the effect of the PDGFRA inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib in IS. Both inhibitors were
able to specifically inhibit PDGFRA kinase activity, but
dasatinib showed higher potency. The stronger inhibitory
capacities of dasatinib toward PDGFR in reference to imatinib were previously shown in rat A10 vascular smooth
muscle cells (47). Additionally, dasatinib showed a more
effective inhibition of downstream ERK1/2 and AKT signaling than did imatinib in primary IS tumor cells. It is
likely that IS cells under PDGFR-targeted treatment are
still able to maintain downstream signaling through the
ERK1/2 and AKT pathways due to EGFR coactivation.
By RTK array, the propagated ex vivo tumor cells lacked
activation of SRC family members. Thus, the possibility
that inhibition of SRC-family kinases could contribute significantly to the inhibitory effect of dasatinib on the
PDGFR downstream signaling pathway is remote. Yet,
the discrete SRC activation to levels not discernible by
our technique could still exist in the tested cells, rendering
them more prone to dasatinib inhibition. Interestingly, it
was recently shown in lung cancer that dasatinib may reduce EGFR activation through the inhibition of SRC,

7312

Cancer Res; 70(18) September 15, 2010

which mediates the phosphorylation of the Y845 residue
in the receptor (48–50).
It is essential to emphasize that the success of the therapy
in IS might strongly depend on the genetic context of the
tumor, which is complex, as indicated by the numerous
CNAs of cancer-related genes identified by aCGH. The
CDKN2A/CDKN2B losses were recurrent in IS in our cohort.
This is in line with previous studies that have shown a
synergistic effect on neoplasia induction when aberrant
oncogenic PDGFRA signaling is combined with loss of
the tumor suppressors CDKN2A/CDKN2B (3, 47). Moreover,
the TP53 pathway seems to be frequently affected in IS
(e.g., common MDM2/CDK4 amplifications), pointing to
confounding factors that might attenuate the response to
RTK inhibition.
Second, an important and hitherto unreported finding in
our study is the concomitant existence of cells with exclusive amplification and cells with coamplification of PDGFRA,
EGFR, or MDM2 within a single tumor, as detected by FISH.
The mechanism leading to gene coamplification remains to
be clarified. In breast cancer, the coamplification most likely
arises by the selection of clones that have both foci amplified rather than as a direct result of prior fusions (51). In our
study, the populations with coamplification and single
amplifications seem to be able to coexist independently. It
is equally important to keep in mind that selection of certain populations might happen once targeted treatment is
started. This provides a rationale for multitargeted treatment of IS.
In conclusion, PDGFRA amplifications are common and
consistently associated with the activation of this gene in
IS. Activation of EGFR is concurrent to PDGFRA activation
and may coexist with amplification and overexpression
of MDM2. Our data provide a rationale for the targeted
treatment of IS with specific PDGFRA, EGFR, and MDM2
inhibitors. Dasatinib may be more efficient than imatinib
for the inhibition of activated PDGFRs, but the effective
therapy for these tumors may require combined regimens
targeting multiple RTKs and/or downstream pathway regulatory effectors.
