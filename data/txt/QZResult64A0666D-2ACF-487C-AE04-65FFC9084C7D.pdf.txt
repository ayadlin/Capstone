Abstract
Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] is an endogenous peptide of the
renin-angiotensin system with vasodilator and antiproliferative properties. Our previous studies showed that Ang-(1-7)
reduced serum-stimulated growth of human lung cancer
cells in vitro through activation of a unique AT(1-7) receptor.
The current study investigates the effect of Ang-(1-7) on lung
tumor growth in vivo, using a human lung tumor xenograft
model. Athymic mice with tumors resulting from injection of
A549 human lung cancer cells were treated for 28 days with
either i.v. saline or Ang-(1-7), delivered by implanted osmotic
mini-pumps. Treatment with Ang-(1-7) reduced tumor volume
by 30% compared with the size before treatment; in contrast,
tumor size in the saline-treated animals increased 2.5-fold.
These results correlate with a reduction in the proliferation
marker Ki67 in the Ang-(1-7)–infused tumors when compared
with the saline-infused tumor tissues. Treatment with Ang(1-7) significantly reduced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA
and protein in tumors of Ang-(1-7)–infused mice when
compared with mice treated with saline as well as in the
parent A549 human lung cancer cells in tissue culture. These
results suggest that Ang-(1-7) may decrease COX-2 activity and
proinflammatory prostaglandins to inhibit lung tumor
growth. In contrast, the heptapeptide had no effect on COX-1
mRNA in xenograft tumors or A549 cells. Because Ang-(1-7),
a peptide with antithrombotic properties, reduces growth
through activation of a selective AT(1-7) receptor, our results
suggest that the heptapeptide represents a novel treatment for
lung cancer by reducing COX-2. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2809–15]

Introduction
Lung cancer is a leading cause of death among men and women
in developed countries, accounting for over 170,000 new cases and
160,000 deaths during 2004 in the United States (1, 2). Despite
improvements in treatment modalities, the 5-year survival rate has
improved to only 14% in the past 30 years, with over a million new
cases of lung cancer diagnosed worldwide annually. This high
mortality often is due to the presence of advanced-stage metastasis
at the initial diagnosis, with more than two thirds of patients
showing lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. This
grim prognosis indicates a continued need for novel therapeutic

approaches to reduce lung cancer mortality. In a retrospective
study of over 5,000 patients in Scotland, the relative risks of
incident and fatal cancer among patients treated with angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were significantly reduced,
with the lowest relative risk in patients with lung or sex-specific
cancers (3). ACE catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I)
to the biologically active peptide Ang II as well as the breakdown of
both bradykinin and the NH2-terminal heptapeptide fragment of
Ang II [Ang-(1-7)] into inactive fragments (4, 5). Ang-(1-7), which is
found endogenously at concentrations similar to Ang II, has both
vasodilator and antiproliferative properties (6, 7). Because treatment of patients or animals with ACE inhibitors results in a
significant elevation in the circulating and tissue levels of Ang-(1-7)
(8, 9), we propose that the reduced lung cancer incidence in ACE
inhibitor–treated patients may be due in part to the antiproliferative actions of the heptapeptide.
Ang-(1-7) attenuated vascular proliferation in vitro in cultured
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and in vivo following
vascular injury (7, 10–13). Ang-(1-7) also reduced protein synthesis
in myocytes (14) and DNA and protein production in cardiac
fibroblasts (14, 15), indicating that the heptapeptide regulates
cardiovascular cell growth. Furthermore, Loot et al. (16) showed
that an 8-week infusion of Ang-(1-7) in rats after coronary artery
ligation improved cardiac function, which was correlated with a
significant decrease in myocyte size in vivo. Thus, the reduction in
DNA synthesis in vitro in VSMCs and myocytes as well as inhibition
of neointimal growth and improvement of cardiac function
observed in rats after Ang-(1-7) infusion show the antiproliferative
effects of the heptapeptide.
Cyclooxygenases, key enzymes in the conversion of arachidonic
acid to prostaglandins and thromboxanes, are important in the
regulation of cellular growth and are altered under pathologic
conditions, such as inflammation and tumor growth. Mitogeninducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is elevated in lung cancers
when compared with nonmalignant tissue controls (17, 18). The
increase in COX-2 is associated with increased production of
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGD2, and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which
are procarcinogenic and contribute to new vessel formation,
angiogenesis, and tumor growth (19). In contrast, prostacyclin is a
potent vasodilator and inhibits cell growth. Pulmonary-specific
overexpression of prostacyclin synthase was associated with a
significant reduction in tumor multiplicity in carcinogen-induced
lung tumors in mice (20). Inhibition of COX-2 activity by treatment
with selective COX-2 inhibitors attenuates the proliferation of
malignant cells in vitro (18) and reduces tumor growth and
metastasis (21, 22). These reports suggest that COX-2 plays a role in
the pathology of lung cancer. Because the signal transduction
mechanisms for the antiproliferative effects of Ang-(1-7) include
changes in arachidonic acid metabolites and the enzymes involved
in their production (7, 12, 23–25), a reduction in COX-2 and the

associated decrease in PGE2, PGD2, and TXA2 or an increase in
prostacyclin may participate in the antigrowth effects of Ang-(1-7).
In our previous study, we found that Ang-(1-7) inhibits the
proliferation of human lung cancer cells in vitro (26). The antiproliferative effect of the heptapeptide was blocked by the selective
Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist [D-alanine7]-angiotensin-(1-7). In
the present study, we extend these studies to evaluate whether
Ang-(1-7) inhibits lung tumor growth in vivo using a human lung
tumor xenograft model and to examine the role of COX-2 in the
antitumorigenic properties of the heptapeptide.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. A549 cells (CCL-185), obtained from the American Tissue
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), are lung adenocarcinoma cells derived
from a 58-year-old male Caucasian. The cells were maintained at 37jC in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Ham’s F12 medium with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 100 Ag/mL penicillin, and 100 units/mL streptomycin. All
media and growth reagents were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand
Island, NY).
Human xenografts. Male athymic mice (15–20 g, 2–4 weeks of age;
Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) were housed in cages with
HEPA-filtered air (12-h light/dark cycle) and ad libitum access to food and
autoclaved water. All procedures complied with the policies of the Wake
Forest University Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were inoculated
s.c. in the lower left flank with f1.9  106 A549 lung cancer cells suspended
in 200 AL of cold Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). After 32 days,
the mice were randomized for treatment with either saline or Ang-(1-7). The
mice were anesthetized by inhalation with 1.5% isoflurane. An osmotic
mini-pump (Alzet model 2004, Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA) was inserted
s.c. to infuse either 24 Ag/kg/h of Ang-(1-7) (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) in
saline or saline alone (6 AL/24 h) into the jugular vein via a microrenathane
catheter (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA) for 28 days. The mini-pumps
also contained heparin (25 units/mL) to maintain patency of the catheter.
On day 28 of the infusion, the animals were anesthetized with halothane
and sacrificed by decapitation.
Immunohistochemistry. Tumors were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 24 h and incubated in 70% ethanol for 48 h before embedding in paraffin.
The embedded tumors were cut into five micron thick sections and stained
with H&E to determine morphology. Cell proliferation in the tumors was
detected by immunostaining with an antibody to Ki67 (1:25; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) using the labeled streptavidin biotin method, as described
previously (27). Stained sections were visualized and photographed with a
video image analysis system (Scion, Inc., Frederick, MD) and public domain
software (NIH Image v1.60). A computer-assisted counting technique with a
grid filter to select cells was used to quantify the immunohistochemical
staining of Ki67 (28). The positive cells were expressed as a percentage of
the total cell number examined (100 cells sampled from each tissue site
within each lung tumor section).
RNA isolation and reverse transcription/real-time PCR. RNA,
isolated from cells or tissue using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies/
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), was subjected to reverse transcription/real-time
PCR as previously described (14). All reactions were done in triplicate, and
18S rRNA, amplified using the Taqman rRNA Control kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), served as an internal control. The results
were quantified as C t values, where C t is defined as the threshold cycle of
PCR at which amplified product is first detected and defined as relative
gene expression (the ratio of target/control).
Western blot hybridization. Quiescent A549 lung cancer cells or
tumor tissue cut into f1 to 2 mm2 size pieces was homogenized in PBS
[50 mmol/L NaPO4 (pH 7.2), 100 mmol/L NaCl]. Plasma membranes were
isolated by centrifugation and solubilized by boiling in 3% SDS-10%
h-mercaptoethanol. PBS was added to the membrane fraction to solubilize
the proteins, and the protein concentration was measured by a modification
of the Lowry method (29). Solubilized protein (20 Ag per well) from salineand Ang-(1-7)–treated animals was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

to polyvinyl membranes (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% blotto (5% evaporated milk, 0.1% Triton
X-100) in TBS [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mmol/L NaCl].
The membranes were incubated with a COX-2 antibody (1:1,000; Cayman
Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) followed by a goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000;
Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Chemiluminescence reagents were added to visualize the immunoreactive bands,
which were quantified by densitometry. An antibody to actin (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) served as the loading control.
Statistics. All data were expressed as means F SE. The comparison of
tumor volume before and after treatment was made using a paired
Student’s t test. The criterion for statistical significance was P < 0.05.

Results
Inhibition of human lung cancer cell growth in vivo. The
effect of Ang-(1-7) on tumor growth was examined in nude mice
with human lung tumor xenografts. Athymic mice were injected
with actively proliferating A549 human lung cancer cells in
Matrigel. When the tumors were f100 mm3 in size, at day 32,
the animals were treated i.v. with either saline or Ang-(1-7) using
an osmotic mini-pump. The first day of infusion was designated as
day 0, and the animals were sacrificed after 28 days of treatment.
Ang-(1-7) was administered at a dose of 24 Ag/kg/h, based on our
previous studies with rats showing that this infusion rate was well
tolerated with no change in body weight, blood pressure, or heart
rate and resulted in a 2- to 3-fold elevation in circulating Ang-(1-7)
(10). During the infusion period, the animals maintained their body
weight as well as food and water consumption and showed no
evidence of reduced motor function. Additionally, no gross
pathologic abnormalities were observed in major organs following
sacrifice, indicating a lack of toxic side effects at the dose given.
No significant difference in the tumor volume of either group
was observed before pump implantation before randomization for
treatment with either saline (96.9 F 14.4 mm3) or the heptapeptide
(117.7 F 21.7 mm3). With increasing time, tumors in the salinetreated mice continued to grow (Fig. 1), whereas tumor volume was
arrested significantly in mice infused with Ang-(1-7). As shown in
Fig. 2A, Ang-(1-7) infusion resulted in a significant reduction in the

average tumor volume compared with the tumors in the salinetreated animals at the end of the 28-day infusion period [saline,
326.3 F 47.2 mm3 versus Ang-(1-7), 84.4 F 19.8 mm3; P < 0.05,
n = 5]. Moreover, a paired comparison of the tumor volume before
and after treatment showed that all the tumors in Ang-(1-7)–
medicated animals were significantly reduced in size when
compared with the pretreatment tumor volume at day 0 (Fig. 2B).
In contrast, the tumor volume of every saline-infused animal
increased over the treatment period. After 28 days, the tumor
volume was reduced 30% in Ang-(1-7)–treated mice when
compared with tumor size before heptapeptide infusion (Fig. 2C).
Conversely, the tumor size increased f2.5-fold in the salinetreated animals during the course of 28 days compared with the
initiation of saline infusion. At the end of the study, the mice were
euthanized, and the tumors were removed and weighed. As shown
in Fig. 3, the tumors from mice treated with Ang-(1-7) weighed 50%
less than the tumors of mice infused with saline (0.13 F 0.01 g
versus 0.28 F 0.03 g; P < 0.05, n = 5).
Effect of Ang-(1-7) on cell proliferation. A portion of each
tumor was fixed in formalin for histologic analysis, and 5-Am
sections from mice infused with saline or Ang-(1-7) were stained
with an antibody to Ki67. Ki67 served as a marker of proliferation,
as it is present throughout all phases of the cell cycle in actively
growing cells (in G1, S, G2, and M); in contrast, Ki67 is absent in
quiescent cells (in the G0 phase). As shown in Fig. 4, cells in tumors
from mice infused with saline showed abundant, robust staining
for Ki67, indicating active cell proliferation. In contrast, cells in
tumors from Ang-(1-7)–infused mice showed reduced immunoreactivity with the Ki67 antibody, suggesting a relative lack of cell
division in the presence of the heptapeptide. The proportions
of proliferating cells in tumors from saline-infused mice was
higher than the proportion in tumors from Ang-(1-7)–infused mice
(73 F 2.9% compared with 49.5 F 9.4%; P < 0.05, n = 5).
Effect of Ang-(1-7) on COX-2. Western blot hybridization was
used to compare the amount of COX-2 protein in tumors from Ang(1-7)–infused mice compared with saline-treated mice. Ang-(1-7)
significantly reduced COX-2 protein by 59% in the mice infused

with Ang-(1-7) when compared with the animals infused with
saline [saline, 0.99 F 0.12 compared with Ang-(1-7), 0.41 F 0.09;
P < 0.05, n = 5], as shown in Fig. 5A. Similarly, an 8-h treatment of
A549 cells with 100 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) caused a marked decrease in
COX-2 protein, as shown in Fig. 5B (P < 0.05, n = 4). These results
suggest that Ang-(1-7) may selectively decrease COX-2 activity and
the production of proinflammatory prostaglandins.
Total RNA was isolated from tumor tissue of mice infused with
saline or Ang-(1-7) and COX-2 mRNA was measured by reverse
transcription/real-time PCR to identify the mechanism for the
reduction in COX-2 protein. Treatment with Ang-(1-7) resulted
in a 57% decrease in COX-2 mRNA in the tumor xenografts compared with treatment with saline (Fig. 6A; P < 0.05, n = 5). COX-1
mRNA was not detected in the A549 lung tumors. Treatment with
100 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) also caused a significant reduction in COX-2

mRNA in A549 cells at 2, 4, and 8 h of treatment (Fig. 6B).
In contrast, there was no change in COX-1 mRNA in quiescent
A549 cells treated with 100 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) at 2, 4, or 8 h (data
not shown).

However, further study at an increased dosage and for longer times
is warranted. The negative slope in Fig. 2B, representing reduced
tumor growth in mice treated with Ang-(1-7), suggests that a longer
infusion time may result in a further decrease in tumor size.
In this report, we found decreased immunostaining of Ki67 and a
reduced proportion of proliferating cells in tumor slices from mice
treated with Ang-(1-7) compared with the saline-infused controls.
These results suggest that the heptapeptide prevents progression
through the cell cycle or the signaling pathways that regulate the
cell cycle. This is in agreement with our previous in vitro studies
showing that pretreatment of human SK-LU-1 lung cancer cells
with 10 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) reduced serum-stimulated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2
(by 61% and 68%, respectively), enzymes whose activities are
increased by mitogen treatment (26). Ang-(1-7) may either inhibit
or down-regulate (a) ERK1 and ERK2 directly, (b) the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases that phosphorylate ERK1
and ERK2, or (c) the MAPK kinase kinase that activates MAPK
kinase. Alternatively, Ang-(1-7) may stimulate or up-regulate a
MAPK phosphatase, which would result in a decrease in active
MAPK.

Discussion
The present study is the first demonstration of the in vivo
efficacy of Ang-(1-7) in human lung A549 adenocarcinoma
xenografts in athymic mice. Administration of the heptapeptide
not only arrested tumor proliferation but also caused a significant
reduction in tumor volume when compared with size before
treatment. Before the administration of either saline or Ang-(1-7),
the xenograft tumors were comparable in size. The tumors continued to grow in mice infused with saline, increasing f2.5-fold at
the end of the 28-day treatment period. In contrast, tumors from
mice infused with Ang-(1-7) for 28 days decreased in size (f30%)
compared with their size at the initiation of treatment. These
results suggest that Ang-(1-7) prevents the proliferation of lung
cancer cells in vivo and expand our previous in vitro studies
showing that Ang-(1-7) caused a marked decrease in the serumstimulated proliferation of A549 cells in tissue culture as well as
an additional human adenocarcinoma cell line (SK-LU-1) and a
squamous cell carcinoma cell line, SK-MES-1 (26).
Ang-(1-7) was administered to the mice using an osmotic minipump with an infusion rate of 24 Ag/kg/h, based upon our previous
studies showing that this rate of infusion resulted in a 2- to 3-fold
increase in plasma Ang-(1-7) (10) and resulted in plasma levels
similar to those obtained by treatment with an ACE inhibitor (8, 9).
No toxic effects were observed in rodents infused with Ang-(1-7)
at this rate, with no change in body weight, heart rate, or blood
pressure. In agreement, Loot et al. (16) and Langeveld et al. (13)
reported no side effects following infusion of the same dose of
Ang-(1-7). Similarly, we observed no adverse reactions or gross
pathologic abnormalities in the mice medicated with the heptapeptide. These data are consistent with the finding of no adverse
side effects in toxicity studies of patients administered the heptapeptide as adjuvant therapy for cytopenia during chemotherapy
(30). Taken together, these studies suggest that the heptapeptide
is well tolerated, an important characteristic of a pharmacologic
agent and a primary requirement for a chemopreventive agent.

Inhibition of Lung Tumor Growth by Ang-(1-7)

Figure 6. Effect of Ang-(1-7) on COX-2 mRNA in human lung xenografts and
A549 lung cancer cells. A, RNA was isolated from tumor tissue of mice infused
with saline or Ang-(1-7). P < 0.05 (n = 5). B, RNA was isolated from A549 human
lung cancer cells treated with 100 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) for 2, 4, or 8 h. P < 0.05

Ang-(1-7) caused a significant reduction in COX-2 protein and
mRNA in both A549 tumor xenografts and A549 cells in tissue
culture, with no change in COX-1. COX-2 is overexpressed in 70%
to 90% of adenocarcinomas (18, 31) and plays an important role
in the pathology of lung cancer. Clinical trials with nonselective
COX inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS),
such as aspirin and indomethacin, show that attenuation of
COX activity reduces the risk for lung cancer. Harris et al. (32)
showed a 68% reduction in relative risk for lung cancer in patients
administered NSAIDS. Epidemiologic studies also show an association between lung carcinoma risk and regular use of NSAIDs
(33). Regular NSAID users (thrice per week or more for 1 year
or longer) had decreased relative risks of lung carcinoma with an
odds ratio of 0.68 (95% confidence interval, 0.53–0.89; ref. 33).
Preclinical studies with selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as
celecoxib and SC-236, showed marked inhibition of tumor growth
and inhibition of angiogenesis (34). These studies indicate that
treatment with COX-2 inhibitors is associated with a reduction in
lung tumor growth. In the current study, the significant reduction
in COX-2 mRNA and protein by Ang-(1-7) in human A549 tumor
xenografts and A549 cells in tissue culture suggests that a decrease
in the production of arachidonic acid metabolites may contribute
to the observed effects of the heptapeptide.
Although the selective inhibition of COX-2 provides a promising
treatment for lung cancer (17, 35), the usefulness of COX-2
inhibitors in cancer therapeutics is questionable based on the
increased risk for cardiovascular events associated with the use of

www.aacrjournals.org

these inhibitors (36). Increased incidence of thrombotic events
(myocardial infarction, angina, and stroke) was reported in clinical
trials using the selective COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib (Vioxx) and
celecoxib (Celebrex) for the treatment of colon cancer. However,
studies show that Ang-(1-7) caused a decrease in thrombus weight
following vena cava occlusion as well as reduced collagen adhesion
to platelets in two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats (37). An
increase in plasminogen-activated inhibitor-1 and tissue plasminogen activator was also observed in cultured human umbilical
endothelial vessels treated with Ang-(1-7) (ref. 38). These results
show that Ang-(1-7) may have a significant advantage over a COX-2
inhibitor as the Ang-(1-7)–mediated reduction in COX-2 mRNA and
protein is associated with important antithrombotic and antiinflammatory activities with additional beneficial actions in terms
of cardiovascular function.
Increased COX-2 is associated with elevated levels of the
downstream enzymes required for prostaglandin synthesis, such
as PGE2 synthase, PGD2 synthase, and TXA2 synthase (19). The
products of these enzymes (PGE2, PGD2, and TXA2) are procarcinogenic and play roles in new vessel formation, angiogenesis, and
tumor growth (39, 40). Although targeted overexpression of
microsomal PGE2 synthase (41) and elevated PGE2 were not
sufficient to induce lung tumors, depletion of the PGE2 receptor
reduced tumor development (42). Similarly, down-regulation of
Bcl-2–associated induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor
invasion resulted from the overexpression of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, the enzyme that degrades PGE2 (43). In
addition, TXA2 stimulates endothelial cell migration and inhibition
of TXA2 production blocked tumor metastasis (44). In contrast,
prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and inhibits cell growth.
Specific overexpression of prostacyclin synthase in the lungs was
associated with a significant reduction in tumor multiplicity in
carcinogen-induced lung tumors in mice (20). These results
indicate the importance of the ratio of PGE2 (or TXA2) to PGI2 in
tumorigenesis. We showed that Ang-(1-7) increased prostacyclin
synthesis in rat, porcine, and rabbit VSMCs, and that inhibition of
prostaglandin production using the nonspecific COX inhibitor
indomethacin and subsequent prostacyclin-mediated activation
of the cyclic AMP–dependent protein kinase prevented the Ang(1-7)–mediated reduction in VSMC growth (7, 10–12). Infusion of
Ang-(1-7) also increased prostacyclin production in salt-induced
hypertensive rats (24). In contrast, TXA2 was suppressed by
Ang-(1-7) infusion, showing that the heptapeptide differentially
regulates PGI2 and TXA2. Thus, Ang-(1-7) may contribute to the
inhibition of the growth of lung cancer cells or lung tumors by
up-regulating or activating PGIS to increase prostacyclin or by
reducing PGE2 production or increasing breakdown, to alter the
PGE2 (or TXA2)/PGI2, or by effects on both enzymes.
The precise molecular mechanism for the transcriptional
regulation of COX-2 by Ang-(1-7) is unknown. The COX-2 promoter
region is complex, containing a large number of binding sites for
inducible transcription factors. Nuclear factor-nh (NF-nh), a
primary regulator of COX-2, is activated by Ang II (45). This
suggests that the Ang-(1-7)–mediated reduction of COX-2 may
occur through a down-regulation or inhibition of NF-nh, as the
actions of the heptapeptide often oppose the physiologic functions
of Ang II (6). Studies are ongoing to reveal the transcriptional
regulators involved in the down-regulation of COX-2 by Ang-(1-7).
The mechanism by which COX-2 increases metastatic growth
includes both the inhibition of apoptosis (46) and stimulation
of angiogenesis (47). Nimesulide, a selective COX-2 inhibitor,

significantly reduced the production of PGE2 and induced
apoptosis in 25% of tumor cells compared with controls (22).
Celecoxib and SC-236, additional selective COX-2 inhibitors, also
inhibited both tumor growth and angiogenesis (34). Previous
studies showed that Ang-(1-7) inhibited angiogenesis in a murine
sponge model, a technique representative of new blood vessel
formation from preexisting blood vessels during wound healing
(48). In the present study, the decreased volume of all Ang-(1-7)–
infused tumors compared with their size before treatment
initiation indicates that the heptapeptide either inhibits angiogenesis and a concomitant loss of nutrient supply or stimulates
apoptosis, to attenuate tumor growth.
The attenuation of lung cancer growth by Ang-(1-7) treatment
may provide the molecular mechanism for the observational
studies showing a decreased risk of lung cancers in hypertensive
patients administered ACE inhibitors (3, 49, 50). These medications are currently in widespread use for the treatment of
hypertension and cause a significant elevation in both tissue
and circulating Ang-(1-7) (8, 9). Ang-(1-7) exerts its antiproliferative effects through activation of the G protein–coupled

receptor mas (14, 26), representing a unique mechanism of
action distinct from other cell growth modulators. Taken
together, our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that Ang-(1-7)
inhibits lung cancer cell growth through activation of a unique
angiotensin peptide receptor and may represent a novel
therapeutic and/or preventive treatment for lung cancer by
reducing COX-2. Thus, Ang-(1-7) could be administered singly,
or a therapeutic modality combining the heptapeptide with
other chemopreventive agents could be used to provide synergistic protection.
