Abstract

Author Manuscript

Acyl carrier protein (ACP) transports the growing fatty acid chain between enzyme domains of
fatty acid synthase (FAS) during biosynthesis.1 Because FAS enzymes operate upon ACP-bound
acyl groups, ACP must stabilize and transport the growing lipid chain.2 The transient nature of
ACP-enzyme interactions imposes a major obstacle to gaining high-resolution structural
information about fatty acid biosynthesis, and a new strategy is required to properly study proteinprotein interactions. In this work, we describe the application of a mechanism-based probe that
allows site-selective covalent crosslinking of AcpP to FabA, the E. coli ACP and fatty acid 3hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase. We report the 1.9 Å crystal structure of the crosslinked
AcpP=FabA complex as a homo-dimer, in which AcpP exhibits two different conformations likely
representing snapshots of ACP in action: the 4′-phosphopantetheine (PPant) group of AcpP first
binds an arginine-rich groove of FabA, followed by an AcpP helical conformational change that
locks the AcpP and FabA in place. Residues at the interface of AcpP and FabA are identified and

validated by solution NMR techniques, including chemical shift perturbations and RDC
measurements. These not only support our interpretation of the crystal structures but also provide
an animated view of ACP in action during fatty acid dehydration. Combined with molecular
dynamics simulations, we show for the first time that FabA extrudes the sequestered acyl chain
from the ACP binding pocket before dehydration by repositioning helix III. Extensive sequence
conservation among carrier proteins suggests that the mechanistic insights gleaned from our
studies will prove general for fatty acid, polyketide and non-ribosomal biosyntheses. Here the
foundation is laid for defining the dynamic action of carrier protein activity in primary and
secondary metabolism, providing insight into pathways that can play major roles in the treatment
of cancer, obesity and infectious disease.

Acyl carrier protein (ACP) plays a central role in transporting starting materials and
intermediates throughout the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1A).3–5 In Escherichia
coli, AcpP interacts with at least twelve enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, plus
seven other enzymes from disparate biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1).6–10 AcpP
sequesters growing metabolites in an interior hydrophobic cavity that protects these
intermediates from non-selective reactivity,11 and selective protein-protein interactions are
believed to be a prerequisite for the delivery of ACP-bound substrate to its catalytic
partners.3 Given the importance of ACP-protein interactions in metabolism and cell
regulatory processes, understanding this “switchblade mechanism” (Fig. 1C) is crucial,12
though this has proven elusive due to the inherently transient nature of ACP-partner
complexes.13

Author Manuscript

We recently deployed synthetic probes to study ACP activity and protein-protein
interactions,14 including a sulfonyl-3-alkyne based probe (1, Fig. 1B) designed to capture
ACP in functional association with 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase with demonstrated
specificity between E. coli AcpP and FabA (Fig. 1C–D).15,16 Probe 1 applied to AcpP and
FabA creates a uniformly crosslinked species (AcpP=FabA) that forms reproducible crystals
in tag-free form (Fig. S4). No crystals form without 1, demonstrating the necessity of
applying probes such as 1 to capture ACP in action.

The AcpP=FabA crystals diffracted to 1.9 Å (Table S2), and we solved the AcpP=FabA
crystal structure by molecular replacement using apo-FabA dimer (PDB: 1MKA)17 and two
butyryl-AcpP (PDB: 2K94) as search templates (Fig. S5). Final refinement revealed the
structure of an AcpP2=FabA2 complex (Fig. 2A), consistent with protein sizing data in
solution. The dimeric FabA forms a “double hotdog” topology,18 with two anti-parallel
“hotdog” helices surrounded by a combined 14-stranded β sheet (Fig. 2A).17,19 The two
AcpP monomers adopt a four-helix bundle fold3 and dock helices II-III with the β5-6 loop of
FabA (Fig. 2D). The contact area is small (539 Å2 and 503 Å2 for the first and second
AcpP=FabA), consistent with the transient nature of AcpP-partner interactions. AcpP has a
negatively charged cleft between helices II and III, which interacts with a positively-charged
arginine-rich patch on FabA (the “Positive Patch”, Fig. 2C).3 The AcpP=FabA interfaces are
mainly electrostatic but also include conserved, hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2D, detailed in
SI). The high sequence conservation of negatively charged residues on helices II and III at
the AcpP=FabA interface (Fig. S2–3) is consistent with previous reports of ACP-partner

complex structures (Fig. 4D),7,20–23 strongly supporting the presence of the Positive Patch
in ACP partner proteins.
Only the position of R137 differs between the two FabA protomers, but in the ACP
structures many residues of helix III move extensively (Fig. 2D and SI), resulting in
different topology near the contact interface between helices II and III (Fig. 2C and SI).
Thus the first AcpP=FabA interaction likely represents a snapshot when AcpP completes its
docking with FabA, resulting in less disorder of AcpP1. Accordingly, the second
AcpP=FabA interaction would represent a snapshot of AcpP in transition, where extensive
movement of helix III is necessary in order for AcpP2 to bind or dissociate from FabA.

Author Manuscript

The natural FAS substrates contain both PPant and acyl chain moieties (Fig. 1B), and the
application of probe 1 shows how both bind to FabA (Fig. S6–7). Probe 1 covalently
connects the active site S36 of AcpP and H70 of FabA and binds in a highly conserved
tunnel of FabA (detailed in SI). Unlike acyl-AcpP structures that contain a hydrophobic
interior pocket to sequester the acyl chain,13 the AcpP in the AcpP=FabA complex structure
contains no interior pocket (Fig. 2E) and closely resembles apo-AcpP (Table S4),24 because
five conserved hydrophobic residues between helices II-III move inward and collapse the
interior pocket (Fig. 2F). This drastic change reflects a dynamic AcpP moving from the
sequestered-substrate state to the open switchblade state to position the substrate within
partner enzyme FabA (Fig. 1C–D).

Author Manuscript

Further characterization of the dynamic interactions between AcpP and FabA was achieved
through comparisons with two-dimensional 1H/15N HSQC spectra of holo-AcpP and
octanoyl-AcpP. Many resonances displayed chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) in residues
that define the hydrophobic pocket of AcpP (Fig. S11). Titrating unlabeled apo-FabA into
each sample allowed us to observe CSPs resulting from dynamic, non-covalent association
with FabA in solution (Fig. 3A–B). In the holo-AcpP-FabA titration experiment, we
observed significant CSPs in residues spanning helices II and III and the adjacent loops (Fig.
S12). In the octanoyl-AcpP-FabA titration experiment, additional CSPs were observed in
residues lining the hydrophobic pocket of AcpP (Fig. 3C), which we attribute to the
translocation of the bound acyl chain out of the AcpP pocket into the FabA active site to
complete the “switchblade” process.

Author Manuscript

We then acquired a two-dimensional HSQC spectrum of the AcpP=FabA complex in 1:2
stoichiometry, with one AcpP crosslinked to each FabA homodimer. When overlaying the
HSQC spectra of the AcpP=FabA complex with the holo- and octanoyl-AcpP titration data
(Fig. 3A–B) obtained with experiments incorporating TROSY,25 we observed a striking
correlation between the CSP shifts in the two AcpP species and the HSQC spectrum of the
complex; the chemical shift of each residue migrates toward the observed chemical shift in
the complex as the concentration of FabA increases. The similarities between CSPs of the
transient binding event and our crosslinked complex (Fig. 3C–F) indicate that the binding
conformation in the crosslinked complex is truly indicative of the natively-bound
conformation.

From the crystal structure we identified acidic residues E41, E47, E53 and E60 of AcpP that
interact with FabA (Fig. 2D and S6), and correspondingly observed large CSPs in these
residues between helices II and III (Fig. 3C–E). Additionally we found large CSPs in the
hydrophobic helix II residues observed in the binding interface of the crystal structure, such
as L37, V40, and M44 (Fig. 2D, 3, and S6). Similarly, the crystal structure observation is
consistent with CSP plots that compare octanoyl-AcpP with crosslinked AcpP=FabA (Fig.
3C–E, Table S8): the strong CSPs for A59, E60, E41 and E47 correspond with side-chain
interactions within the Positive Patch of FabA. Large CSPs in S36, L37, and D38
correspond with a change in the PPant position as it extends into the FabA. T63 undergoes
significant rotation when comparing the octanoyl and the AcpP=FabA complex. Ultimately,
these CSP observations both complement and corroborate binding observations found in the
crystal structure.

To study the detailed dynamics of AcpP and its interaction with FabA, we measured
Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs)26 from weakly aligned samples of octanoyl-AcpP and
AcpP in the AcpP=FabA complex (Fig. 4A–B). The empirical RDCs were combined with
accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD) simulations27 to provide structural-dynamic
information in the μs regime (detailed in SI).28 Within this framework, we identified the
optimal acceleration parameters, and hence optimal conformational space sampling criteria
for the correlation of experimental and theoretical RDCs (Fig. 4A), and calculated the
averaged NH order parameters at both fast (ns) and slow RDC-optimized (μs) timescales
(Fig. 4B). On fast-time scales (ns), no substantial differences in the order parameters
between octanoyl-AcpP and AcpP=FabA are observed. By contrast, in the slow (μs) time
regime, substantial differences in the structural-dynamic behavior of octanoyl-AcpP and
AcpP=FabA are identified, indicating that AcpP is dramatically stabilized in the presence of
FabA, especially in the N-terminal region of helix II and the helix II-III loop. There is a
striking correlation between the AcpP=FabA binding interface observed in the crystal
structure (Fig. 2), the NMR titration data (Fig. 3), and molecular dynamics simulations (Fig.
4B–C), all highlighting key dynamic residues.

Author Manuscript

These results provide a window into the dynamic properties of AcpP, which sequesters
elongated substrates in its interior cavity with motion at the helix II-III loop on a μs
timescale. A likely order of events is that the Positive Patch of FabA first interacts with
PPant attached to S36 of AcpP. Once in proximity, residues R132 and K161 of FabA form
salt bridges with E41 and E47 on helix II of AcpP, anchoring the complex; while R136 and
R137 serve to pry away helix III of AcpP through interactions with A59 and E60, thus
disrupting shielding of the sequestered substrate. V40 and L37 on AcpP form hydrophobic
interactions with L138 and V134 on FabA. All of these binding events serve to stabilize
AcpP in an open conformation, allowing the sequestered substrate to release from AcpP and
insert into the pocket of FabA as the AcpP hydrophobic cavity collapses. Together, these
results provide an unprecedented verification of the switchblade mechanism (Fig. 1C). We
surmise that the identity of the sequestered substrate can affect the positioning of helix II
and helix III of AcpP, thereby modulating successful binding and switchblade events for
selective catalysis.

The application of crosslinking probes to gain structural insights now lays a foundation for
defining the dynamic events associated with the mechanism of action of ACP. The approach
can be applied to other carrier protein partners from primary and secondary metabolism such
as FAS, polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase,3,29,30 as well as other
carrier protein-dependent pathways that play major roles in the treatment of cancer, obesity
and infectious disease (Table S9).

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

All proteins used were overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and purified by Niaffinity followed by FPLC chromatography. The AcpP=FabA complex was generated as
previously reported and crystallized at room temperature by sitting drop vapor diffusion at
30 mg/mL in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 350 mM sodium acetate, 1 M LiCl and 35
% PEG3350. Data were collected on beamline 12-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Lightsource (SSRL) and beamline 8.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) and processed
with HKL2000. The AcpP=FabA crystallographic phases were determined by molecular
replacement using FabA as the search template. Protein NMR data were collected at the
UCSD Biomolecular NMR facility. Details of the molecular dynamics simulations are
included in Supplementary Discussion. Detailed experimental procedures are described in
the Supplementary Methods.
