ABSTRACT
ARID1A mutations are observed in various tumors, including ovarian clear cell
(OCCC) and endometrioid carcinomas, endometrial, and breast carcinomas. They
commonly result in loss of ARID1A-protein expression and frequently co-occur with
PI3K/AKT-pathway activating mechanisms. The aim of this study was to test the
hypothesis as to whether PI3K/AKT-pathway activation is a critical mechanism in
ARID1A-mutated tumors and if consequently ARID1A-deficient tumors show increased
sensitivity to treatment with PI3K- and AKT-inhibitors. Upon ARID1A knockdown,
MCF7 breast cancer cells and primary MRC5 cells exhibited a significantly increased
sensitivity towards the AKT-inhibitors MK-2206 and perifosine, as well as the PI3Kinhibitor buparlisib. Knockdown of ARID1A in MCF7 led to an increase of pAKT-Ser473.
AKT-inhibition with MK-2206 led to increased apoptosis and to a decrease of pS6K in
ARID1A-depleted MCF7 cells but not in the controls. In five OCCC cell lines ARID1Adeficiency correlated with increased pAKT-Ser473 levels and with sensitivity towards
treatment with the AKT-inhibitor MK-2206. In conclusion, ARID1A-deficient cancer
cells demonstrate an increased sensitivity to treatment with small molecule inhibitors
of the PI3K/AKT-pathway. These findings suggest a specific requirement of the PI3K/
AKT pathway in ARID1A-deficient tumors and reveal a synthetic lethal interaction
between loss of ARID1A expression and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway.

INTRODUCTION

[14-16], as well as clear cell renal cell carcinomas [17,
18]. The majority of the mutations lead to a loss of the
ARID1A encoded protein [3], also referred to as BAF250a
or p270, which is a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin
remodeling complex [2]. Although ARID1A has recently
been identified as a bona fide tumor suppressor gene and
is currently being intensively investigated, the knowledge
about the function and the consequences of a loss of
expression of this protein is relatively limited [2].
Interestingly, ARID1A mutations frequently
coexist with activating mutations of PIK3CA [12, 19]
and/or loss of PTEN expression [20], which both lead
to a downstream activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
Furthermore, it has recently been shown in endometrial
cancer that loss of ARID1A expression leads to an
increased phosphorylation of AKT at Ser-473[21].

Mutations in the gene encoding the AT-rich
interacting domain containing protein 1A (ARID1A) are
frequently observed in a wide variety of gynecological
and non-gynecological cancers [1, 2]. These occur in
approximately 50% of endometriosis-associated ovarian
clear cell (OCCC) and 30% of endometrioid ovarian
carcinomas (EnOC) [3, 4], in endometrial carcinomas,
with a loss of expression in 20-30% depending on the
histological subtype [5, 6], as well as in breast carcinomas
(mutations in 4-35%) [7, 8]. Non-gynecological
carcinomas with frequent ARID1A mutations include
pancreatic carcinomas (mutations in 8-45%) [9, 10],
gastric adenocarcinomas (mutations in 8-29%) [1113], hepatocellular carcinomas (mutations in 10-17%)

Similarly, increased AKT phosphorylation has also been
reported in OCCC tissue samples with loss of ARID1A
expression when concomitant PIK3CA mutations and loss
of PTEN expression were excluded [22].
These
observations
strongly
suggest
interdependency between ARID1A mutations and PI3K/
AKT pathway activation, indicating that tumor cells
with loss of ARID1A expression may be dependent on
constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT-pathway and
consequently may also be more vulnerable to its inhibition
[23]. This is of considerable clinical relevance since loss
of ARID1A expression may be predictive for a favorable
treatment response to small molecule inhibitors of the
PI3K/AKT-pathway, which are currently under clinical
investigation.
In this study, we demonstrate that depletion of
ARID1A protein expression significantly increases
the sensitivity of cancer cells towards PI3K- and AKTinhibitors, which is reflected by increased rates of
apoptosis in treated ARID1A-depleted cells. Our findings
suggest a dependency of ARID1A-mutated tumors on
activating mechanisms of the PI3K/AKT-pathway, which
may be exploited therapeutically.

approximately 7-fold in ARID1A-depleted MRC5 cells
(p=0.004).
As a control, no significant difference in sensitivity
to treatment with MK-2206 or perifosine was found in
the ARID1A-deficient OCCC cell line OVSAYO after
transfection with ARID1A siRNA.

ARID1A-deficient cell lines demonstrate increased
sensitivity to treatment with the PI3K-inhibitor
buparlisib
The sensitivity to treatment with the PI3K inhibitor
buparlisib in ARID1A-depleted MCF7 and MRC5 cells
was shown to increase significantly with comparison to the
controls, but less pronounced than for inhibition of AKT
(Figure 1c). The LogIC50 values were -6.780 ±0.150 for
ARID1A-depleted MCF7 cells, as compared to -6.252
±0.184 for the controls (approximately a 3-fold increase;
p=0.025) and -6.712 ±0.154 for ARID1A-depleted MRC5
as compared to -5.950 ±0.128 for the controls (p=0.002),
representing an almost 6-fold increase in sensitivity.
The ARID1A-deficient control cell line, OVSAYO, did
not show an increased sensitivity for buparlisib upon
transfection with ARID1A siRNA.

RESULTS

Loss of ARID1A expression increases AKT
phosphorylation at Ser-473 and downstream
phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase in MCF7 and
MRC5 cells

ARID1A-deficient cell lines demonstrate increased
sensitivity to treatment with the AKT-inhibitors
MK-2206 and perifosine

First, we verified that loss of ARID1A increases
phosphorylation of AKT at Ser-473 (pAKT-Ser473) as has
been described in endometrial cancer cell lines [21]. In
both MCF7 and MRC5 cell lines, ARID1A knockdown by
siRNA led to an increased phosphorylation of pAKT-Ser473
as well as an increased downstream phosphorylation of
p70S6kinase (pS6K) as shown in Figure 2a and 2b.

ARID1A-depleted MCF7 cells were found to be
significantly more sensitive to treatment with the AKTinhibitors MK-2206 and perifosine, as demonstrated
in Figure 1a and 1b. The LogIC50 values for treatment
with MK-2206 were -7.411 ±0.211 in ARID1A-depleted
MCF7 cells, when compared to -4.841 ±0.273 in the
controls (p<0.0001). This represents a more than 370fold increased AKT inhibitor sensitivity of ARID1Adepleted MCF7 cells as compared to the wild-type control.
LogIC50 for perifosine in ARID1A-depleted MCF7 cells
was -4.984 ±0.133, compared to the LogIC50 of -3.774
±0.423 (p=0.0001) for the controls, which means an
approximately 16-fold increased sensitivity.
We performed the same experiment in the primary
fibroblast cell line MRC5 to verify our observations in a
cell line without any oncogenic mutations and, similarly,
we found an increased sensitivity of ARID1A-depleted
MRC5 cells towards treatment with MK-2206 with
LogIC50 of -6.307 ±0.173 as compared to -5.316 ±0.236
for the control (p=0.002). This meant an approximately 10fold increase in sensitivity. For treatment with perifosine
the LogIC50 values were -5.867 ±0.135 in ARID1Adepleted MRC5 cells, as compared to -5.024 ±0.199 in
the controls: equivalent to an increase in sensitivity of

AKT-inhibition leads to apoptosis in ARID1Adeficient cells
We next investigated if inhibition of AKT leads
to increased apoptosis in ARID1A-deficient cells. No
cleavage of PARP1 (a marker of apoptosis) was observed
in the MCF7 control cells (transfected with siLUC) with
or without treatment with the AKT-inhibitor, MK-2206.
In contrast, PARP1 cleavage was discretely detectable in
ARID1A-depleted MCF7 cells and substantially increased
after treatment with the AKT-inhibitor MK-2206 (Figure
2a). Similar observations were made for MRC5 (Figure
2b). Consistently, using a TUNEL-assay technique we
found that apoptosis was markedly increased in ARID1Adepleted MCF7 and MRC5 cells treated with MK-2206,
in comparison to the control cells that expressed normal

levels of ARID1A (Figure 3). Upon siARID1A transfection
and treatment with MK-2206, PARP1 cleavage was not
increased in the ARID1A-deficient control cell line,
OVSAYO, which confirmed that the increased apoptosis
rate in response to the AKT-inhibitor treatment was
specifically due to the knockdown of the ARID1A gene
and not to other unspecific factors that would be indirectly
related to the transfection method (Figure 2c).

Ser473- and AKT- levels, and led to a decreased level of
pS6K, but did not lead to a difference in the amount of
viable MCF7 cells after 5 days (Figure 2d, 2e). In contrast,
combined knockdown of ARID1A and AKT1 completely
abrogated the increased proliferation in ARID1A-depleted
MCF7 cells (Figure 2d).

Knockdown of AKT abrogates the increased
proliferation rate of ARID1A-depleted MCF7
cells

Loss of ARID1A expression correlated with
increased pAKT-Ser473 in five OCCC cell lines (Figure
4b, 4c). The cell lines, OVSAYO, OVISE, and HCH-1,
did not express detectable levels of ARID1A and showed
high sensitivity towards treatment with the AKT-inhibitor,
MK-2206, whereas the two OCCC cell lines with intact
ARID1A expression were resistant towards the same

ARID1A depletion led to an increased proliferation
of MCF7 cells in comparison to the controls (Figure 2d).
Knockdown of only AKT1 reduced measurable pAKT-

siRNAs did not show an effect on pAKT-Ser473 and PARP-1 cleavage in this cell line, confirming that the effects are specifically due to
the knockdown of the ARID1A gene. Combination of ARID1A-knockdown and treatment with MK-2206 did not cause increased PARP1 cleavage in this control cell line. (D) MCF7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and transfected with siLUC, siAKT1, siARID1A, or

cells in relation to the siLUC-transfected controls). ARID1A knockdown led to an increased proliferation of MCF7 cells in comparison
to the controls. Knockdown of only AKT1 did reduce measurable pAKT-Ser473- and AKT- levels and led to a decreased level of pS6K (as
shown in (E)), but did not lead to a difference in the amount of viable MCF7 cells. Combined knockdown with AKT1 in contrast completely
abrogated the increased proliferation in ARID1A-depleted MCF7 cells. (E) Western blot showing the decreased expression of pAKT-Ser473,

Figure 3: Treatment with the AKT-inhibitor MK-2206 causes apoptosis in ARID1A-depleted MCF7 and MRC5 cells.

Treatment with MK-2206 (10-6M) for 48h led to an increased rate of apoptotic cells in ARID1A-depleted MCF7 and MRC5 cells compared
to the controls. Note the different staining pattern of apoptotic cells compared to the positive controls, which is caused by pyknosis and/or
fragmentation of the nuclei in the apoptotic cells (indicated by red arrows). The more homogeneous staining in the positive controls is the
result of treatment of intact nuclei of fixated non-apoptotic cells with DNase immediately prior to the addition of the TUNEL incubation
mix. Negative controls were obtained by omission of the TUNEL enzyme in the incubation mix. The nuclei are represented in blue (DAPI
staining) and the fluorescein signal is labelled in red-glow.

treatment. The logIC50 values significantly differed between ARID1A-intact and ARID1A-deficient OCCC cell lines (***p<0.0001) as

treatment (Figure 4a).

This indicates that ARID1A-mutated cell clones require
a second-hit mutation in order to transform into cancer,
which may explain why loss of ARID1A expression
was observable in a subset of non-atypical benign
endometriosis in one of our previous studies [30].
Interestingly, ARID1A-mutated OCCC have been
reported to be associated with resistance to conventional
platinum-based chemotherapy regimens in a recent study
[31]. If this observation is confirmed in larger collectives,
an analysis of the ARID1A expression status, which is
easily feasible by immunohistochemistry, will possibly
become an important predictive tool to assess the
probability of resistance to conventional platinum based
chemotherapy and, as we suggest in this study, increased
sensitivity to PI3K- and/or AKT-inhibitors. PI3K/AKTinhibitors, which are a promising tool to overcome
chemotherapy resistance, may be selectively added to
the treatment strategy in patients with ARID1A-deficient
tumors.
In conclusion, ARID1A deficiency leads to a
significantly increased sensitivity towards PI3K- and
AKT-inhibition in tumor cells in vitro. The findings
suggest a specific requirement of the PI3K/AKT pathway
in ARID1A-deficient cancer cells and reveal a synthetic
lethal interaction between loss of ARID1A expression and
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway.

DISCUSSION
The results of this study demonstrate an
interdependency of ARID1A and the PI3K/AKT
pathway, which results in significantly increased
sensitivity of ARID1A-deficient cancer cells to PI3Kand AKT- inhibition. We thus demonstrate for the first
time a principle of synthetic lethality between ARID1A
deficiency and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway in
two cellular model systems. MCF7 is a well-established
breast carcinoma cell line and MRC5 a commonly used
human primary lung fibroblast cell line. Although MCF7
contains a moderately activating mutation of PIK3CA
[24, 25], depletion of ARID1A by siRNA considerably
increased phosphorylation of AKT at Ser-473 in this cell
line, as described previously in endometrial carcinoma cell
lines [21]. The normal primary fibroblast cell line, MRC5,
that does not contain any known mutations [26] confirmed
our results, thus minimizing the likelihood of secondary
effects by other mutations in the ARID1A knockdown
experiments.
Mutations in the ARID1A gene are a frequent event
occurring in a wide variety of gynecological and nongynecological cancers [23]. They usually lead to a loss
of expression of the ARID1A encoded protein [3], and
are thus not directly targetable [2]. Indirect therapeutic
approaches using the principle of synthetic lethality in
regard to members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
complexes are an appropriate alternative strategy [27,
28]. Thus, a recent study demonstrated a synthetic
lethal relationship between inactivating mutations of the
homologs ARID1A and ARID1B, both in primary and
cancer cells. ARID1B depletion in the context of loss
of ARID1A expression led to a significant decrease in
cell proliferation revealing this homologue as a relative
vulnerability in ARID1A-mutant cell lines. Despite the
substantial relevance of these observations for potential
future approaches, the immediate clinical relevance
is limited due to the fact that there are currently no
substances available that would therapeutically inhibit
ARID1B expression [28].
An interdependency between ARID1A mutations and
PIK3CA is strongly supported by the supplementary data
of the study of Helming et al., since PIK3CA (just after
ARID1B) scored as the second top candidate preferentially
necessary for the growth of ARID1A-mutated cancer cell
lines in the project, ‘Achilles’ [28]. A dependency of
ARID1A-mutated tumors on activation of the PI3K/AKT
pathway is further supported by a study in ARID1Aknockout and ARID1A/PTEN-double-knockout mice,
where it was observed that only mice with simultaneous
loss of ARID1A and PTEN expression developed poorly
differentiated ovarian tumors, in contrast to mice with loss
of only ARID1A that did not develop ovarian tumors [29].

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell culture
The breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 (E.
Felley-Bosco, Switzerland) and the human primary
lung fibroblasts MRC5 (ATCC) were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco,
LifeTechnologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Waltham, MA, USA). The OCCC cell lines ES-2, RMG-1,
OVSAYO, OVISE, HCH-1 (R. Natrajan, UK) were grown
in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco). All cell lines used in this
study were verified by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA
identity testing. All growing media were supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and AntibioticAntimycotic (containing penicillin, streptomycin and
amphotericin B) (Gibco). Cell cultures were maintained
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. Cells were
passaged at 90% confluency.

Transient siRNA transfections
Transient knockdown of ARID1A was performed
with four different ARID1A siRNAs (J-017263-05, -06,
-07, and -08, ON-TARGETplus Human ARID1A siRNA,
Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) using RNAimax (Gibco)

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The control
cells were transfected with siRNA against luciferase
(sense):
CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGATTdTd
(Microsynth AG, Baldach, Switzerland). The AKT1
knockdown control experiments were performed with
a siRNA smart-pool (L-003000-00, ON-TARGET plus
Human AKT1 (207) siRNA, Dharmacon). Cells were
transfected overnight and the medium was replaced the
following morning. The size of culture dishes and length
of transfection is indicated for the specific experiments .

S6 Kinase (pS6K) (#9204, Cell Signaling Technology,),
PARP-1 (#9542, Cell Signaling Technology), betaActin (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs SG, Switzerland).
Incubation with the primary antibody was followed by
incubation with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(anti-mouse and anti-rabbit HRP, Sigma-Aldrich) and
chemiluminescent detection of proteins (Amersham, GE
Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).

Treatment with AKT- and PI3K- inhibitors

TUNEL assay and fluorescence microscopy

The AKT-inhibitors MK-2206, perifosine, and
the pan-PI3K-inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) were all
obtained from Selleckchem.com (Selleck Chemicals,
Houston, TX, USA). The inhibitors were diluted according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (MK-2206 and buparlisib
in DMSO and perifosine in sterile ddH2O) and prepared
freshly for each treatment. Vehicle substance was used in
the highest corresponding concentration for the treatment
of the controls.

A TUNEL assay (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit,
Fluorescein, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) based on labelling
of DNA strand breaks was used to directly visualize
apoptosis in the treated cell cultures. In brief, cells were
directly plated on microscopy coverslips transfected with
siRNAs and treated for 60h with MK-2206 or vehicle
substance as described above. Positive controls were
obtained by treatment of fixated non-apoptotic cells with
30U/l recombinant DNase (in 1% (w/v) BSA / PBS) for
1h immediately prior to the addition of the incubation
mix. Negative controls were obtained by omission of the
TUNEL enzyme in the incubation mix. The coverslips
were mounted in DAPI mounting medium (Vectashield,
Reactolab SA, Servion, Switzerland). A Leica DMI6000B
microscope was used for analysis of the specimens.

Drug sensitivity assays
Drug sensitivity assays were performed according to
the drug manufacturer’s recommendations (Selleckchem.
com). In brief, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at
concentrations of 1000-2000 cells per well (MRC5 cells
were seeded at a density of 10’000 cells per well). On the
following day, cells were transiently transfected overnight
with the corresponding siRNAs and then treated with
the corresponding drugs at the indicated concentrations
or vehicle substance as described above. Treatment was
repeated after 2-3 days. After a total period of 4-5 days’
treatment, the medium was replaced by phenol-red free
medium and the quantity of viable cells was assessed using
a MTS assay (Cell Titer Aqueous, Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Plate
absorbances were obtained using a spectrophotometer
(Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer, BioTek, Winooski,
VT, USA). Each experiment was performed on at least
two separate occasions for every unique ARID1A siRNA
sequence and each of them run in triplicates.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with graph pad
prism version 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA,
USA). Results are expressed as mean ± standard error
of the mean (SEM). Significance was assumed if p<0.05
(F-test) in comparison to the respective controls.
