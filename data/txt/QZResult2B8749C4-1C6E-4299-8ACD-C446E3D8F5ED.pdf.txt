ABSTRACT
Although HER2-targeting antibody trastuzumab confers a substantial benefit for
patients with HER2-overexpressing breast and gastric cancer, overcoming trastuzumab
resistance remains a large unmet need. In this study, we revealed a STAT3-centered
positive feedback loop that mediates the resistance of trastuzumab. Mechanistically,
chronic exposure of trastuzumab causes the upregulation of fibronection (FN), EGF
and IL-6 in parental trastuzumab-sensitive breast and gastric cells and convergently
leads to STAT3 hyperactivation. Activated STAT3 enhances the expression of FN, EGF
and IL-6, thus constituting a positive feedback loop which amplifies and maintains the
STAT3 signal; furthermore, hyperactivated STAT3 signal promotes the expression of
MUC1 and MUC4, consequently mediating trastuzumab resistance via maintenance of
persistent HER2 activation and masking of trastuzumab binding to HER2 respectively.
Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 disrupted STAT3-dependent positive
feedback loop and recovered the trastuzumab sensitivity partially due to increased
apoptosis induction. Combined trastuzumab with STAT3 inhibition synergistically
suppressed the growth of the trastuzumab-resistant tumor xenografts in vivo. Taken
together, our results suggest that feedback activation of STAT3 constitutes a key
node mediating trastuzumab resistance. Combinatorial targeting on both HER2 and
STAT3 may enhance the efficacy of trastuzumab or other HER2-targeting agents in
HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION

considerable clinical efficacy and improves survival in
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer [4-6]. It has
been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for use in early-stage and metastatic HER2-positive
breast cancers as well as in metastatic, unresectable HER2positive gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers [7].
Despite the survival benefits gained from
trastuzumab therapy, many patients with metastatic HER2positive breast cancer do not respond to initial trastuzumab
treatment (de novo resistance) and the majority of

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)

growth and differentiation signaling pathways and is
greatly overexpressed in approximately 20% to 25% of
breast [1, 2] and 30% of gastric cancers [3], leading to
an aggressive tumor phenotype and dismal prognosis.

RESULTS

trastuzumab-responsive patients develop resistance within
1 year of treatment initiation [8, 9]. A number of resistance
mechanisms have been proposed: (i) aberrant activation
of the PI3K/AKT pathway due to phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN) deficiency or PIK3CA gene activating
mutations [10, 11], (ii) alternative activation of other RTK
signals [12-15], (iii) the accumulation of truncated HER2
receptors (p95HER2) that lacks the trastuzumab-binding
domain [16], (iv) downregulation of p27(kip1) level
[17], and (v) cyclin E amplification/overexpression[18].
Although these findings provide considerable insights
into the trastuzumab resistance, additional mechanisms
remain to be identified, and further studies are also needed
to explore whether similar resistance mechanisms are
operative in breast and gastric cancer.
We have previously established two trastuzumabresistant cell lines (BT474R and NCI-N87R) respectively
derived from HER2-overexpressing breast and gastric
cancer cell lines (BT474 and NCI-N87) in vitro by
continuously culturing parental cells with increasing dose
of trastuzumab for a long period of time and found that
these two resistant cells displayed a markedly enhanced
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription-3 (STAT3) compared to parental cells
(unpublished data). STAT3 is a latent cytoplasmic
transcription factor that delivers signals from the cell
surface to the nucleus in response to extracellular
signals, such as cytokines or growth factors [19]. STAT3
is constitutively activated in many types of human
cancers and plays crucial roles in regulating tumor cell
proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, and
immune evasion [20, 21]. Accumulating evidence has
demonstrated that aberrant expression and activity of
STAT3 are implicated in both cancer stem cell (CSC)
expansion and associated drug resistance in several
cancer types, including breast and gastric cancer [22-25],
suggesting that STAT3 may contribute to trastuzumab
resistance in HER2-positive solid cancer.
In this study, we show that STAT3 phosphorylation
is significantly increased in de novo and acquired
trastuzumab-resistant breast and gastric cancer cells.
The increased STAT3 signaling is mediated by elevated
expression of fibronection (FN), EGF, and IL-6 in
an autocrine manner, which convergently leads to
trastuzumab resistance via upregulating the expression
of MUC1 and MUC4, two downstream targets of
STAT3 capable of inducing trastuzumab resistance via
maintaining HER2 activation and masking of trastuzumab
binding to HER2 respectively. Notably, abrogation of
STAT3 activation by knocking down STAT3 expression
or STAT3-specific small-molecule inhibitor recovered the
trastuzumab sensitivity of resistant cells in vitro and in
vivo. The data suggest that STAT3 inhibitor in combination
with trastuzumab may overcome the trastuzumab
resistance in patients with HER2-positive solid tumors
exhibiting hyperactivated STAT3 signal.

STAT3 hyperactivation in acquired trastuzumabresistant cells
We firstly obtained trastuzumab-resistant HER2amplified BT474R breast cancer cell line and NCIN87R gastric cancer cell line by culturing parental
cells with increasing doses of trastuzumab for over 15
months in vitro. Compared with parental cells, BT474R
and NCI-N87R exhibited significantly resistance to
trastuzumab treatment in vitro (Fig. 1A). Similarly,
trastuzumab treatment had little effect on in vivo growth
of subcutaneously established xenografts from BT474R
and NCI-N87R cells although evident suppression
was seen for the xenografts from parental BT474 and
NCI-N87 cells (Fig. 1B). Correspondingly, trastuzumab
treatment markedly inhibited the AKT phosphorylation in
xenografts from parental BT474 and NCI-N87 cells but
not from their corresponding resistant cells as evidenced
by immunohistological staining of phosphorylated AKT in
excised tumor xenografts (Supplementary Fig. 1).
To probe the molecular alterations underlying
trastuzumab resistance, we screened the status of
alternative RTKs and their downstream signaling pathways
previously implicated in trastuzumab resistance.[12-15]
As shown in Fig. 1C, a significant increase in STAT3
phosphorylation (at Tyr705) was noted in both resistant
cancer cells compared to their parental cells, which was
also evident in tumor xenografts presenting an increased
staining of phosphorylated STAT3 (Supplementary
Fig. 1). The resistant cells also exhibited an increased
EGFR phosphorylation (at Tyr1068), indicating that
EGFR signaling may be involved in acquired resistance
mechanisms in our model. No changes in PTEN protein
and AKT phosphorylation were observed, suggesting
that the acquired resistance of BT474R and NCI-N87R
cells to trastuzumab was not due to PI3K/AKT pathway
enhancement. In addition, the levels of HER2, HER3
and IGF1R proteins and their phosphorylation were
unchanged in the resistant cells (Fig. 1C). Collectively,
the data suggest that hyperactivation of STAT3 pathway
may be a key signaling alteration contributing to acquired
trastuzumab resistance in our model.

STAT3 is hyperactivated in de novo trastuzumabresistant cells
PTEN deficiency confers de novo trastuzumab
resistance [11]. We applied PTEN-targeting siRNA (siPTEN) to successfully knockdown PTEN expression as
indicated by decreased PTEN expression and increased
AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). As expected, knocking
down PTEN expression induced considerable resistance

in vitro. In contrast, parental BT474 and NCI-N87 cells
expressing STAT3-CA displayed an evident increase in
STAT3 expression and its phosphorylation compared to
cells expressing control vector, which made them highly
resistant to trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition (Fig.
3D). The data indicate that STAT3 hyperactivation is
sufficient to confer trastuzumab resistance.

to trastuzumab treatment compared to control cells (Fig.
2B). Notably, although PTEN silencing had no obvious
effect on EGFR activation, it led to a prominent increase
in STAT3 phosphorylation, indicating that PTEN loss also
induced STAT3 hyperactivation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore,
silencing STAT3 in PTEN-deficient BT474 parental
cells significantly rescued the sensitivity of these cells to
trastuzumab treatment (Fig. 2C and 2D). Therefore, STAT3
hyperactivation due to PTEN deficiency contributed to the
de novo trastuzumab resistance, and such resistance could
be overcome by STAT3 inhibition in PTEN-deficient cells.

Heterogeneous mediators lead to STAT3
heperactivation contributing to trastuzumab
resistance

STAT3 regulates the sensitivity to trastuzumab
treatment

Our results demonstrate that the STAT3
hyperactivation causes trastuzumab resistance; however,
upstream mediators leading to STAT3 hyperactivation
remain unclear. We screened the expression of 91 known
genes involving STAT3 signaling pathway in parental
versus their resistant cells by custom-designed highthroughput RCR array (Supplementary Tab. 1). The
significant elevated expression of FN and its ligand β1
integrin was consistently observed in the two resistant cells
compared to parental cells with a prominent upregulation
of EGF and IL-6 in the respective BT474R and NCIN87R cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A), which was further
confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 4A), conventional

To further elucidate the role of STAT3 pathway in
trastuzumab resistance, STAT3 was silenced in the two
resistant cell lines BT474R and NCI-N87R (Fig. 3A),
and the constitutively active form of STAT3 (STAT3CA) was ectopically expressed in two parental cell lines
BT474 and NCI-N87 (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C,
transfection with STAT3-targeting siRNA, but not control
siRNA, decreased the levels of STAT3 expression and
phosphorylation in BT474R and NCI-N87R cells, leading
to restoration of their sensitivity to trastuzumab treatment

RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 2B) and western blotting
(Supplementary Fig. 2C). The results from conventional
RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 2B) and western blotting
(Supplementary Fig. 2C) also confirmed the unchanged
IL-10 and downregulated LIF expression as seen in RCR
array (Supplementary Tab. 1), further validating the
effectiveness of PCR array assay.
To validate the role of FN, EGF and IL-6 in causing
STAT3 hyperactivation and consequent trastuzumab
resistance, we stimulated parental cells with recombinant
proteins or knocked down the expression of these
molecules in resistant cells to evaluate STAT3 activation
and trastuzumab sensitivity. Either FN, EGF or IL-6
stimulation alone enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation

in parental BT474 and NCI-N87 cells with combined
stimulations (FN/EGF or FN/IL-6) further increasing
STAT3 activation, causing the resistance of these parental
cells to trastuzumab treatment (Fig. 4B and 4C, left panel).
Conversely, knockdown of FN EGF or IL-6 expression
suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation in resistant BT474R
and NCI-N87R cells, resulting in partial rescue of
sensitivity of these cells to trastuzumab treatment (Fig. 4B
and 4C, right panel). Combined silencing (FN/EGF or FN/
IL-6) further inhibited the STAT3 activation and almost
completely restored the trastuzumab sensitivity in resistant
cells. However, no significant change in the trastuzumab
sensitivity was seen when IL-10 expression was silenced
in resistant cells (Supplementary Fig. 3), pointing to the

importance of FN, EGF and IL-6 in STAT3-mediated
trastuzumab resistance.
Notably, we found that silencing STAT3 expression
also decreased the expression of FN/EGF and FN/IL-6
expression in the respective BT474R and NCI-N87R
cells (Fig. 4D), indicating that a positive feedback loop
between STAT3 and FN/EGF or FN/IL-6 is operated in
these resistant cells which amplifies and fosters the STAT3
signal and consequently mediates trastuzumab resistance.
Taken together, the data suggest that heterogeneous
mediators converge on STAT3 hyperactivation
contributing to trastuzumab resistance in our model.

PCR array (Supplementary Fig. 2A), we found that
MUC1 and MUC4, two STAT3 target genes previously
implicated as a mediator of trastuzumab resistance in
breast cancer [26-31], were most prominently upregulated
in trastuzumab-resistant cells with a more preferential
upregulation of MUC1 (2.83 fold) and MUC4 (8.49
fold) seen in BT474R and NCI-N87R cells respectively.
Western blotting and immunohistochemistry confirmed
the upregulation of MUC1 and MUC4 in resistant cells
and their corresponding tumor xenografts at the protein
levels respectively (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Furthermore, silencing STAT3 expression decreased the
expression of MUC1 and MUC4 in both BT474R and NCIN87R cells (Fig. 5B); conversely, both FN/EGF and FN/
IL-6 stimulations enhanced the STAT3 phosphorylation
and consequently increased the expression of MUC1 and
MUC4 in parental BT474 and NCI-N87 cells respectively
(Fig. 5C). The data reveal that the expression of MUC1
and MUC4 is subjected to STAT3 signal in these cells.
To further define the role of MUC1 and MUC4
in mediating trastuzumab resistance, we attenuated
their expression in resistant cells to determine whether

STAT3 upregulates the expression of MUC1 and
MUC4 that mediates trastuzumab resistance
To figure out the executioners of trastuzumab
resistance induced by STAT3 hyperactivation, we
analyzed the expression alteration of target genes
downstream of STAT3 activation in trastuzumabresistant cells relative to parental cells. From the above

trastuzumab sensitivity could be rescued. As shown in
Fig. 5D, knockdown of MUC1 and MUC4 partially
recovered the trastuzumab sensitivity in both BT474R
and NCI-N87R cells with a more pronounced effect for
MUC1 and MUC4 seen in the BT474R and NCI-N87R
cells respectively, corresponding to their preferential
upregulation in these two cell lines. Only upon MUC1 or
MUC4 silencing, trastuzumab treatment suppressed the
AKT phosphorylation and induced a prominent apoptosis
in respective BT474R or NCI-N87R cells as evidenced
by the appearance of cleaved caspase 3 and 7 and
decreased levels of their precursor proteins (Fig. 5E and
5F), indicating MUC1 or MUC4 knockdown recovers the
sensitivity of BT474R or NCI-N87R cells to trastuzumab

treatment by decreasing the prosurvival AKT signal and
increasing the apoptosis induction.
Previous studies have demonstrated that MUC1 and
MUC4 mediated trastuzumab resistance predominantly by
maintenance of persistent HER2 activation and masking
of trastuzumab binding to HER2 respectively [26, 27, 31].
Consistent with previous findings, we found that MUC1
but MUC4 silencing inhibited the HER2 phosphorylation
in BT474R cells (Fig. 5E and 5F), making them more
susceptible to trastuzumab-induced apoptosis; however,
knockdown of MUC4 expression in NCI-N87R cells
significantly increased the binding of trastuzumab to
HER2 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Collectively, STAT3
mediate the trastuzumab resistance via regulation of

STAT3 inhibition overcomes
resistance in vitro and in vivo

inhibited the STAT3 phosphorylation and prosurvival
AKT signal (Fig. 6D, upper two panels). Consistent with
their modulation by STAT3 signal, MUC1 and MUC4
expression in excised xenografts were suppressed by
either S3I-201 alone or combination treatment (Fig. 6D,
bottom two panels). Notably, we did not observed severe
side effects in combination treated mice as evidenced
by their undisturbed body weight increase during the
course of treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6) and lack of
toxic manifestation in histological staining of their major
organs at the terminus of experiments (Supplementary Fig.
7). Taken together, the data demonstrate that inhibition
of STAT3 activity resensitizes trastuzumab-resistant to
trastuzumab treatment in vitro and in vivo at least partially
due to increased apoptosis induction, and combined
treatment of trastuzumab and STAT3 inhibitor is an
effective strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance in
this scenario.

trastuzumab

Since the data underscore a central role of STAT3
hyperactivation in mediating trastuzumab resistance,
we hypothesized that targeting this pathway could be an
effective strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance.
To target STAT3, we used S3I-201, an available smallmolecule STAT3 inhibitor in preclinical studies [32]. As
expected, S3I-201 effectively inhibited STAT3 activity
and sensitized resistant BT474R and NCI-N87R cells to
trastuzumab treatment in vitro (Fig. 6A). Accordingly,
combined treatment of S3I-201 and trastuzumab
suppressed AKT phosphorylation and caused a prominent
apoptosis in resistant cells (Fig. 6B). Addition of S3I-201
also increased the suppressive efficacy of trastuzumab in
parental BT474 and NCI-N87 cells (Supplementary Fig.
5).
To validate these results in vivo, mouse xenograft
tumor models were established by subcutaneous
injection of BT474R and NCI-N87R cells. As expected,
trastuzumab treatment alone marginally suppressed the
growth of BT474R and NCI-N87R xenografts in vivo
(Fig. 6C); however, combined S3I-201 and trastuzumab
treatment significantly retarded in vivo growth of BT474R
and NCI-N87R xenografts. S3I-201 treatment alone also
had a modest growth-suppressing effect in these two
models. Immunohistochemistry of excised xenografts
demonstrated that only combined treatment concomitantly

DISCUSSION
Although trastuzumab has resulted in a clinically
and statistically significant benefit in patients with HER2overexpressing breast and gastric cancer, many patients
develop resistance after treatment, which ultimately
culminates in treatment failure [33]. Despite multiple
resistance mechanisms have been proposed in breast
cancer, it remains unclear whether the similar mechanisms
of trastuzumab resistance operate in gastric cancer. The
investigation of trastuzumab resistance mechanisms and
consequent design of relevantly therapeutic strategies is
persistently under intensive research.

Figure 7: Schematic presentation of the molecular mechanism of trastuzumab resistance mediated by STAT3-dependent
feedback loop and corresponding targeting strategy. (A) STAT3 is activated through multiple signaling pathways in our model,
including SRC-dependent EGF:EGFR:STAT3 signaling, FN:EGFR:STAT3 signaling, and IL-6:JAK2:STAT3 signaling. Activated STAT3
promotes the expression of FN, EGF and IL-6 and therefore constitutes a positive feedback loop to persistently maintain STAT3 signaling,
which leads to the upregulation of MUC1 and MUC4 mediating trastuzumab resistance via sustaining HER2 phosphorylation and/or
blocking trastuzumab binding. (B) In STAT3 hyperactivation-mediated trastuzumab-resistant cancer cells, STAT3-specific small-molecule
inhibitor S3I-201 efficiently inhibits STAT3 activation and consequent expression of MUC1 and MUC4, which recovers trastuzumab
sensitivity leading to suppression of HER2 signaling, downstream AKT activity and finally apoptosis in response to trastuzumab treatment.

STAT3 appears to be a point of convergence for
numerous oncogenic signaling pathways. Constitutive
activation of STAT3 has been detected at high frequency
in diverse human cancer cell lines and tissues, including
breast cancer and gastric cancer [34-36]. Suppression
of STAT3 activity by small-molecule inhibitors leads to
increased apoptosis, chemosensitivity, and decreased
angiogenesis in cancer cells with constitutively activated
STAT3 [32, 37]. Here, we provide strong evidence that
increased STAT3 activity confers de novo and acquired
resistance to trastuzumab in our model system. This
mechanism of trastuzumab resistance has not been
previously identified in HER2-positive gastric cancer
model, although recent studies have shown that STAT3
activation promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in breast cancer
[22-24], which may contribute to trastuzumab resistance.
We further demonstrate that inhibition of STAT3 by
siRNA-mediated knockdown or a small molecule
inhibitor S3I-201 universally sensitized trastuzumabresistant cells to trastuzumab treatment and significantly
suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. The
superior antiproliferative and antitumor effect of STAT3
inhibition in combination with trastuzumab concurred
with its ability to promote cell apoptosis and reduce AKT
phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition,
we noted that even in the trastuzumab-sensitive parental
cells, addition of STAT3 inhibitor resulted in a greater
magnitude of response compared with trastuzumab alone.
This may not be surprising, given the universe presence of
constitutive activation of STAT3 signaling in these cancer
cells and their well-characterized prosurvival effect.
This novel combination strategy warrants further clinical
investigation in patients with trastuzumab-resistant tumors
given that constitutively activated STAT3 is present in a
quite fraction of patients with HER2-positive breast and
gastric cancer [38, 39].
Many factors in tumors have been shown to
transiently or persistently activate STAT3 signaling that is
known to regulate the expression of specific target genes
and has important roles in tumorigenesis. To determine
the key upstream factors and downstream target genes
responsible for STAT3-mediated trastuzumab resistance in
current models, we compared the expression of 91 known
genes involving STAT3 signaling pathway in both resistant
cells over their parental cells by high-throughput PCR
array. Besides selective elevation of EGF and IL-6, two
well-known STAT3 trigger genes, in respective BT474R
and NCI-87R cells, FN and its ligand β1 integrin were
shown to be consistently upregulated in both resistant cell
lines, whose expression were further confirmed at mRNA
and protein levels by RT-PCR and western blotting.
Recent studies have shown that β1 integrin overexpression
or engagement by FN activates STAT3 signaling
pathway via JAK2, SRC or FAK adaptor proteins,
which participates in breast cancer progression or their
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resistance to HER2-targeting small-molecule inhibitors
[40, 41], as has found β1 integrin in mediating resistance
of lung cancer to EGFR-targeting drugs [42, 43]. FN-β1
integrin signal was also found to synergistically enhance
STAT3 activation induced by EGF and IL-6 in breast or
other cancer cells [40, 44]. In addition, we observed that
silencing STAT3 decreased the expression of FN, EGF and
IL-6 in resistant cells; thus, it is reasonable to speculate
that a positive feedback loop involving FN/EGF/STAT3
or FN/IL-6/STAT3 is operative in BT474R or NCI-87R
resistant cells respectively, which leads to the propagation
and amplification of STAT3 signaling contributing to
trastuzumab resistance (Fig. 7A).
Our data show that the expression of MUC1 and
MUC4, two STAT3 target genes [45, 46], was markedly
increased in resistant cells compared to their parental
cells, and was upregulated in parental cells in response to
stimulations from FN, EGF and IL-6 via STAT3 pathway.
MUC1 and MUC4 have been previously described
to mediate trastuzumab resistance via promotion of
HER2 activation and blockade of trastuzumab binding
respectively in breast and gastric cancer [27, 31].
Consistent with previous findings, MUC1 knockdown
inhibited HER2 activation in resistant BT474R cells,
resensitizing them to trastuzumab-induced growth
suppression and apoptosis. Likewise, MUC4 silencing
derepressed the hindrance of trastuzumab binding to
HER2 leading to the partial recovery of trastuzumab
sensitivity in resistant NCI-87R cells. Silencing both
MUC1 and MUC4 further produced a synergistic effect,
resulting in an almost recovery of trastuzumab sensitivity
in both resistant cells. These results indicate that selfmaintained persistent STAT3 signal mediates trastuzumab
resistance via upregulating the expression of MUC1 and
MUC4 in our model (Fig. 7A).
Emerging evidence suggests that STAT3 activation
can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
consequently propagate cancer stem cells (CSCs) that
have been described to be responsible for HER2-targeting
drug resistance and ultimate tumor recurrence in breast
and gastric cancers [22-25]. Thus, it will be interesting
to learn whether a similar mechanism is operative in our
model in future studies.
In conclusion, our work proposes a possible
mechanism of trastuzumab resistance fostered by a
STAT3-centered positive feedback loop comprising of FN/
EGF/IL-6 upstream mediators and MUC1/4 downstream
executioners in HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer,
providing a rationale for applying STAT3 inhibitors
to overcome trastuzumab resistance (Fig. 7B). We
acknowledge that studies need to be done to further define
the role of intratumoral STAT3 activation in mediating
trastuzumab resistance using clinical tumor samples.
It may be a good start to retrospectively explore the
correlation between STAT3 phosphorylation and therapy
response in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast and

TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were synthesized by
Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-qPCR
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. Conventional
RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of FN and
its integrin receptors. Amplification of GAPDH was
used as the control. The differences in gene expression
between parental and trastuzumab-resistant cell lines were
validated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) using
GoTaq qPCR Master Mix with SYBR green (Promega)
on Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) as recommended
by the manufacturer. The data were analyzed using the
comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method with GAPDH
as an internal control. The primer sequences are available
upon request.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, plasmids and small interfering RNA
(siRNA)
BT474 breast cancer cell line and NCI-N87 gastric
cancer cell line were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). BT474R
and NCI-N87R cells were selected for resistance to
trastuzumab by continuously culturing parental cells with
increasing doses of trastuzumab for longer than 15 months
as previously described.[47] The plasmid pcDNA3.1STAT3-CA (constitutively activated mutant of STAT3)
was obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA).
Cells were transiently transfected with siRNA using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The siRNA specific for
STAT3, PTEN, MUC1 and control siRNA (si-Co) were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Denvers, MA,
USA). FN, IL-6, IL-10, EGF and MUC1/4 targeting
siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA). For assessing the effect of FN
stimulation, cells were incubated in serum-free medium
onto culture plates pro-coated with 50 μg/ml of FN
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) or bovine serum
albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) for 12 h. For EGF and
IL-6 stimulations, cells were treated with 20 ng/ml EGF
or IL-6 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 2 h.

PCR array
96-well custom PCR array (Qiagen, Shanghai,
China) was designed to assess gene expression changes
of resistant cells relative to parental cells, in which 91
genes involved in the activation and downstream effects
of STAT3 signaling and five housekeeping genes were
included (see Supplementary Table 1). The PCR array was
performed and analyzed according to the instruction from
manufacturer.

In vivo tumor model
Female athymic nude mice (5-6 weeks old;
Weitonglihua Biotechnology, Beijing, China) were
maintained and treated under specific pathogen-free
conditions. Mice were injected in the left flank area
subcutaneously (s.c.) with 5 × 106 indicated tumor cells
in 100 μl of PBS. When xenografts reached a diameter of
4-5 mm, animals were randomized into different treatment
groups (5 mice per group) with similar mean tumor
sizes in each group. Mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.)
given trastuzumab (10 mg/kg in 100 µl PBS) or vehicle
control (PBS) once per week and/or intravenously (i.v.)
administered with S3I-201 (5 mg/kg in DMSO) thrice
weekly. Mice were monitored for tumor growth and tumor
volume was calculated according to the formula: volume
=π/6 × a2 × b, where a is the smallest superficial diameter
and b is the largest superficial diameter.

Cell growth inhibition assay
A total of 3000 cells were seeded in triplicate into
96-well plates. After 12 h, the medium in the wells was
replaced with fresh medium containing drugs as indicated.
In some experiments, the cells were transfected with
gene-specific siRNA, 24 h later, were subjected to serum
starvation overnight, and seeded in serum-free medium
onto FN-coated plates for 12 h, with culture onto BSAcoated plates as controls. After treatment for an additional
4 d, cell viability was determined using CellTiter 96
AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit
(Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) and calculated with
GraphPad Prism software (Castro Valley, CA, USA). Cell
inhibition (%) was calculated as follows: (1 - experimental
absorbance/control absorbance) × 100.

Western blotting analysis

Conventional and real-time quantitative reverse
transcriptase (RT)-PCR

The whole-cell protein lysates or animal tumor tissue
specimens were prepared as previously described [47]
and analyzed by western blot with the following primary
antibodies: phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3, Tyr705),
phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT, Ser473), phosphorylated

A total of 1 × 106 cells were collected for each
sample. The total RNA was isolated from cells using

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated
AKT, phosphorylated STAT3, MUC1 and MUC4 was
done as previously described.[47] Briefly, tumors were
harvested from mice 40 d after treatment and fixed in 10%
formalin, from which 4 μm-thick sections were made.
The slides were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide
to quench endogenous peroxidase activities. After heatinduced antigen retrieval, the specimens were blocked
with normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature, and
incubated with the antibodies against p-AKT (Ser473),
p-STAT3 (Tyr705), MUC1 and MUC4 using a predefined
optimal concentration at 4 ˚C overnight. Slides underwent
color development with 3-3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and
were counterstained with hematoxylin. Photomicrographs
were taken with an Olympus microscope BX51.
