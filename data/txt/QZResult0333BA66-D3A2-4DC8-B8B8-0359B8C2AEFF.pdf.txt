Abstract

HHMI Author Manuscript

Solid cancer cells commonly enter the blood and disseminate systemically but are highly
inefficient at forming distant metastases for poorly understood reasons. We studied human
melanomas that differed in their metastasis histories in patients and in their capacity to metastasize
in NSG mice. All melanomas had high frequencies of cells that formed subcutaneous tumours, but
much lower percentages of cells that formed tumours after intravenous or intrasplenic
transplantation, particularly among inefficient metastasizers. Melanoma cells in the blood and
visceral organs experienced oxidative stress not observed in established subcutaneous tumours.
Successfully metastasizing melanomas underwent reversible metabolic changes during metastasis
that increased their capacity to withstand oxidative stress, including increased dependence upon
NADPH-generating enzymes in the folate pathway. Anti-oxidants promoted distant metastasis in
NSG mice. Folate pathway inhibition using low-dose methotrexate, ALDH1L2 knockdown, or
MTHFD1 knockdown inhibited distant metastasis without significantly affecting the growth of
subcutaneous tumors in the same mice. Oxidative stress thus limits distant metastasis by
melanoma cells in vivo.

Circulating cancer cells are commonly observed in the blood of patients and mice with
1 4
5
various cancers – . However, metastasis is a very inefficient process in which few
6 8
disseminated cancer cells survive and even fewer proliferate – . Some patients can have
9 11
circulating cancer cells in their blood without evidence of metastasis or worse outcomes – .

HHMI Author Manuscript

Epithelial cells undergo cell death when they detach from extracellular matrix in culture as a
12 13
result of reduced glucose uptake, ATP depletion, and oxidative stress , . Oncogenic
signaling can promote their survival by increasing glucose uptake and flux through the
pentose phosphate pathway, which generates NADPH and regenerates glutathione, a buffer
14
against oxidative stress . Glutathione is necessary for the initiation of some cancers and
15 18
anti-oxidants can promote cancer initiation and progression – . Cancer cells thus undergo
genetic changes within primary tumours that increase their capacity to withstand oxidative
stress, raising the question of whether additional adaptations are required during metastasis.
Breast and lung cancer cell lines undergo metabolic changes during invasion in culture and
metastasis in vivo that would be expected to reduce the generation of reactive oxygen
18 23
species (ROS) – . Nonetheless, it is unknown whether ROS levels change in
metastasizing cells in vivo or whether this limits distant metastasis. In fact, anti-oxidants
inhibit the metastasis of some cancer cell lines, raising the possibility that ROS promotes
24 26
metastasis in certain contexts – .
We addressed these issues by studying melanomas from multiple patients that were
xenografted into NOD/SCID IL2Rγnull (NSG) mice. Melanoma metastasis in this assay is
predictive of clinical outcome in patients: stage III melanomas that metastasize efficiently in
NSG mice go on to form distant metastases in patients, despite surgical resection, whereas
27
melanomas that metastasize inefficiently in mice are usually cured by surgery in patients .

Blood and viscera are hostile to metastasis
We obtained four efficiently (UT10, M481, M405, and M514) and four inefficiently (M597,
M528, M610, and M498) metastasizing melanomas from patients. All expressed melanoma
markers (Extended data figure 1). The efficiently metastasizing melanomas formed distant
metastases in patients and in NSG mice after subcutaneous injection (Extended data figure
2a).

HHMI Author Manuscript

The inefficiently metastasizing melanomas did not form distant metastases in patients or
macrometastases in NSG mice (Extended data figure 2a). The efficient and inefficient
metastasizers did not significantly differ with regard to the frequency of cells that formed
tumours after subcutaneous injection in NSG mice (Table 1) or the rate at which these
tumours grew (Extended data figure 2b). One in 8 cells from efficient metastasizers and 1 in
11 cells from inefficient metastasizers formed tumours upon subcutaneous injection (Table
1). We often detected circulating melanoma cells (CMC) by flow cytometry in the blood of
mice with efficiently metastasizing, but not inefficiently metastasizing, melanomas
(Extended data figure 3a and b).
To test if the main difference between efficient and inefficient metastasizers is the ability to
enter circulation, we intravenously injected 10, 100, 1000, or 10,000 cells from efficiently

and inefficiently metastasizing melanomas into NSG mice. The melanoma cells were
marked by luciferase expression, allowing us to confirm micro and macrometastases by
bioluminescence imaging. Efficiently metastasizing melanomas from all four patients
formed macrometastases in multiple visceral organs (Extended data figure 3c). Limiting
dilution analysis indicated that at least 1 in 235 cells formed tumours upon intravenous
injection (Table 1). In contrast, only 1 in 2,540 cells from inefficiently metastasizing
melanomas formed tumours after intravenous injection (Table 1 and Extended data figure
3d). Therefore the ability to enter circulation is not the only factor that limits distant
metastasis.
These data also demonstrate that even efficiently metastasizing melanomas more readily
formed tumours after subcutaneous injection (1 in 8 cells) as compared to intravenous
injection (1 in 235 cells, Table 1). This was true even when efficiently metastasizing
melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously without Matrigel (1 in 60 cells formed tumors;
p<0.001). This suggests the blood was more hostile to melanoma cells than the subcutaneous
environment.

HHMI Author Manuscript

If distant metastasis is limited mainly by survival in the blood, direct injection into a visceral
organ should increase tumour formation. To test this we injected efficiently and inefficiently
metastasizing melanomas into the spleens of NSG mice. Efficiently metastasizing
melanomas from two of three patients formed macrometastases in multiple visceral organs
in most mice (Extended data figure 3e and Table 1; at least 1 in 173 cells formed tumours
upon intrasplenic injection). In contrast, only 1 in 3,677 cells from inefficiently
metastasizing melanomas formed tumours after intrasplenic injection (Extended data figure
3f and Table 1). The ability to survive in circulation is therefore not the only factor that
limits distant metastasis. The spleen is also a relatively hostile environment for melanoma
cells.

Reversible tropic changes during metastasis

HHMI Author Manuscript

To test whether melanoma cells undergo changes in properties during metastasis, we
obtained efficiently metastasizing melanoma cells from 12 donor mice that had been grafted
with melanomas from 3 patients (M481, M405 and UT10). We compared the capacity of
melanoma cells from subcutaneous tumours versus the blood versus etastatic liver nodules
(2–5 mm in diameter) in the same donor mice to form tumours upon subcutaneous,
intravenous, or intrasplenic injection in recipient mice (Table 2a; see Extended data figure 3g
for experimental design). Upon subcutaneous injection, melanoma cells from subcutaneous
tumors were significantly better at forming tumours (1 in 14 cells formed tumours) as
compared to melanoma cells from the blood (1 in 63 cells) or metastatic nodules (1 in 55
cells; Table 2a). In contrast, upon intrasplenic injection, melanoma cells from metastatic
nodules were significantly better at forming tumours (1 in 130 cells) as compared to
melanoma cells from the blood (1 in 372 cells) or subcutaneous tumours (1 in 708 cells;
Table 2a). This suggests melanoma cells adapt to sites of metastasis as they metastasize.
To test whether the changes were irreversible (i.e. genetic) or reversible (i.e. epigenetic or
metabolic), we tested whether small numbers of metastatic melanoma cells would reacquire

subcutaneous properties after being passaged subcutaneously for a short period of time. We
subcutaneously transplanted 100 cells from subcutaneous tumours, the blood, or metastatic
liver nodules of the same donor mice into primary recipient mice and allowed them to form
tumours for up to 12 weeks (Table 2b; all injections formed tumours). Then we
retransplanted melanoma cells from the subcutaneous tumours into subcutaneous,
intravenous, or intrasplenic sites in secondary recipient mice (Extended data figure 3h shows
experimental design). Melanoma cells that originated in all sites formed subcutaneous
tumours with high efficiency in secondary recipient mice after being passaged
subcutaneously (Table 2b). Melanoma cells that originated in all sites formed metastatic
tumours with low efficiency after intravenous or intrasplenic injections in secondary
recipient mice after being passaged subcutaneously (Table 2b). The changes in tumourigenic
tropism during metastasis are thus reversible. Since these reversible changes were observed
very consistently, even in small numbers of melanoma cells, these changes cannot reflect
selection for rare genetic events during metastasis followed by reversion mutations after
subcutaneous re-transplantation.

Oxidative stress limits distant metastasis
HHMI Author Manuscript

We performed LC-MS/MS metabolomics on subcutaneous tumours and visceral metastatic
nodules from the same NSG mice transplanted with efficiently metastasizing melanomas
derived from 4 patients. In two independent experiments, unsupervised clustering of
metabolomics data showed that metastatic nodules obtained from the liver, pancreas, and
kidney almost always clustered together, distinct from subcutaneous tumours, irrespective of
xenograft line (Extended data figure 4a and b; complete metabolomics data are shown in
Extended data tables 1 and 2). Among subcutaneous tumours and among metastatic nodules,
samples clustered by patient. We obtained similar results when melanoma cells were isolated
by flow cytometry, excluding mouse cells (Extended data figure 4c). The metabolic
differences between subcutaneous tumours and visceral metastases appeared to be largely
reversible as metabolomics analysis of tumours from Table 2b showed that subcutaneous
tumours clustered together irrespective of whether they arose from the transplantation of
subcutaneous, circulating, or metastatic cells (Extended data figure 4d and e).

HHMI Author Manuscript

In a total of six independent experiments that involved four different technical approaches,
the glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio was always significantly higher
in subcutaneous tumours as compared to metastatic nodules or circulating melanoma cells
(Figure 1a and 1b and Extended data figure 4f). This was true irrespective of whether
melanoma cells were isolated by dissection or by flow cytometry (to eliminate stromal
cells). The lower GSH/GSSG ratio in circulating melanoma cells and metastatic nodules
suggested that metastasizing cells experienced oxidative stress not observed in established
subcutaneous tumours, and they consumed GSH in an effort to maintain redox homeostasis.
Consistent with this, cytoplasmic ROS levels were significantly higher in circulating
melanoma cells and visceral metastatic nodules as compared to subcutaneous tumours
(Figure 1c). Mitochondrial ROS levels were significantly higher in visceral metastatic
nodules as compared to circulating melanoma cells and subcutaneous tumours (Figure 1d).

Mitochondrial respiration is one of the main sources of ROS. Mitochondrial mass declined
significantly in circulating melanoma cells and metastatic nodules as compared to
subcutaneous tumours (Figure 1e). Mitochondrial membrane potential also declined
significantly in circulating melanoma cells as compared to subcutaneous tumours but not in
metastatic nodules (Figure 1f). These data raised the possibility that mitochondrial function
is reduced in circulating melanoma cells in an effort to reduce ROS generation.
These changes in redox status between subcutaneous and metastasizing cells appeared to be
reversible. Even though the GSH/GSSG ratio was always higher in subcutaneous tumours as
compared to metastatic nodules, the GSH/GSSG ratio in subcutaneous tumours derived from
the transplantation of metastatic cells was even higher than the GSH/GSSG ratio in
subcutaneous tumours derived from the transplantation of subcutaneous cells (Extended data
figure 4g).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Changes in mitochondrial mass between subcutaneous and metastatic melanoma cells were
also reversible. Subcutaneous tumours always exhibited significantly higher mitochondrial
mass as compared to metastatic nodules, irrespective of whether the subcutaneous tumours
arose from the transplantation of subcutaneous tumour cells, circulating cells, or metastatic
cells (Figure 1g and Extended data figure 4h).
To test if oxidative stress limits melanoma metastasis we subcutaneously transplanted
efficiently metastasizing melanoma cells derived from three patients into NSG mice and
treated the mice with daily subcutaneous injections of the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine
(NAC; 200 mg/kg/day). In no case did NAC treatment significantly affect the growth of
established subcutaneous tumours (Figure 2a) but it significantly increased the frequency of
melanoma cells in the blood of mice transplanted with M405 and UT10 (Figure 2b) and
significantly increased metastatic disease burden in mice with all three melanomas (Figure
2c). Oxidative stress therefore limits the metastasis of melanoma cells in vivo.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Among efficiently metastasizing melanomas from three patients, NAC pre-treatment of cells
and administration to mice increased tumour formation after intravenous injection by 10fold (p<0.0001; Extended data table 3a). Among inefficiently metastasizing melanomas
from two patients, tumours only arose from cells treated with NAC (Extended data table 3b).
Oxidative stress thus limits tumorigenesis by circulating melanoma cells.

Metabolic adaptations during metastasis
We hypothesized that successfully metastasizing cells undergo reversible metabolic changes
that increase their capacity to withstand oxidative stress. One such adaptation that could
28 30
promote survival would be increased GSH regeneration – . NADPH is needed to convert
GSSG into GSH and increased production of NADPH promotes the regeneration of
28 30
GSH – . In fact, we observed significantly higher levels of NADPH and NADP in
metastatic cells as compared to subcutaneous tumours (Figure 2d and e). The NADPH/
NADP ratio was significantly reduced in metastases as compared to subcutaneous tumours
for one melanoma (M481) but not for a second (UT10; Extended data Figure 5e). The higher
levels of NADPH in metastases raised the possibility that metastasizing cells generate more

NADPH to increase their capacity to regenerate GSH. The oxidative stress in these cells
would be predicted to consume more NADPH, potentially explaining why the NADPH/
NADP ratio did not necessarily change despite increases in the amounts of NADPH and
NADP.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Metastatic nodules had high levels of purine intermediates relative to subcutaneous tumors
in the same mice (Extended data tables 1 and 2). This could reflect changed folate pathway
activity. Moreover, folate metabolism is a major source of NADPH for oxidative stress
29 31
management – , raising the question of whether the folate pathway promotes distant
metastasis. NADPH regeneration by the folate pathway involves the conversion of serine to
glycine and the donation of a methyl group to tetrahydrofolate (see Extended data figure 5j).
Serine can be imported into cells as well as produced de novo from glucose via the
glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG). Elevated de novo serine synthesis
32 33
promotes the growth of some melanomas and breast cancers , . To test for alterations of
these pathways during metastasis we administered uniformly 13C labeled glucose to NSG
mice bearing melanomas derived from three patients. We observed significantly
increased 13C labeling of serine and glycine in metastatic tumours as compared to
subcutaneous tumours (Figure 3f and 3g and Extended data figure 5c and 5d). However, we
observed no differences between subcutaneous tumours and metastases in terms of the
fractional enrichments of uniformly labeled lactate or 3-PG, the precursor used for de novo
serine synthesis (Extended data figure 5a and 5b). Metastatic tumours thus display enhanced
contribution of glucose carbon to tissue serine and glycine levels, suggesting increased flux
through the folate pathway.
Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis of key enzymes in the folate pathway
showed a striking increase in the expression of the NADPH-regenerating enzyme ALDH1L2
in liver, pancreas, and lung metastases compared to subcutaneous tumours, though not in
kidney metastases (Figure 3a; Extended data figure 6). Some metastases also showed
reduced expression of an NADPH-consuming folate metabolism enzyme, MTHFR (Figure
3a). The expression of other folate metabolism enzymes did not consistently change during
metastasis, nor did a variety of other enzymes in anti-oxidant pathways (Figure 3a; Extended
data table 4).

HHMI Author Manuscript

We compared ALDH1L2 levels in subcutaneous tumours versus metastatic nodules from
mice transplanted with subcutaneous, circulating, or metastatic melanoma cells. ALDH1L2
was much more highly expressed in liver nodules than subcutaneous tumours in both donor
and recipient mice, irrespective of whether the subcutaneous tumours arose from
subcutaneous, circulating, or metastatic melanoma cells (Figure 3h). The changes in
ALDH1L2 expression during metastasis were thus reversible.
To test whether metastasizing cells are more dependent than subcutaneous cells on the folate
pathway we transplanted melanoma cells from three patients subcutaneously in NSG mice
and treated with low dose of methotrexate (1.25 mg/kg/day), an inhibitor of dihydrofolate
reductase (Extended data figure 5j). We simultaneously provided thymidine (3 mg/kg/day)
and hypoxanthine (750 μg/mg/day) to the mice to ameliorate the effects of folate pathway
inhibition on nucleotide metabolism. Methotrexate treatment in these conditions had no

significant effect on the growth of subcutaneous tumours (Figure 3b); however, the
frequency of circulating melanoma cells in the blood of the same mice was significantly
reduced (Figure 3c), as was metastatic disease burden (Figure 3d), in mice bearing all three
melanomas. Metastasizing melanoma cells are therefore particularly sensitive to folate
pathway inhibition.
30

Depletion of ALDH1L2 can decrease the GSH/GSSG ratio in vitro . To test whether
ALDH1L2 is required for metastasis we identified two shRNAs that knocked down
ALDH1L2 expression in melanoma cells (Extended data figure 5f). We infected melanoma
cells derived from three patients with either of these shRNAs or a scrambled control shRNA
then injected the cells subcutaneously in NSG mice. Neither shRNA against ALDH1L2
significantly affected the growth of subcutaneous tumours (Figure 3e) but both significantly
reduced the frequency of circulating melanoma cells in the blood of mice bearing 1 of 2
melanomas (Figure 3f) and overall metastatic disease burden in both melanomas (Figure 3g).
ALDH1L2 thus promotes melanoma metastasis in vivo.

HHMI Author Manuscript

We performed a similar experiment on another NADPH-regenerating enzyme in the folate
pathway, MTHFD1 (Extended data figure 5j). We identified two shRNAs that knocked down
MTHFD1 expression in melanoma cells (Extended data figure 5g). Neither shRNA against
MTHFD1 significantly affected the growth of subcutaneous tumours (Figure 3i) but they
reduced the frequencies of circulating melanoma cells in the blood (Figure 3j) and metastatic
disease burden in mice bearing both melanomas (Figure 3k). MTHFD1 thus promotes
melanoma metastasis in vivo.
6 8

Our results suggest that few circulating cancer cells survive and proliferate – because of
oxidative stress. Our results further suggest that metabolic pathways that regenerate NAPDH
and buffer oxidative stress represent therapeutic targets to impede distant metastasis.
Metastasizing melanoma cells are more dependent on certain NADPH-regenerating folate
pathway enzymes than subcutaneous melanoma cells. However, these enzymes cannot
account for the increase in NADP in metastatic nodules as compared to subcutaneous
tumours (Figure 2d and 2e). Therefore, metastasizing cells likely also undergo additional
metabolic changes that promote the generation of NADP and NADPH.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Changes in the expression of individual folate pathway enzymes are unlikely to be sufficient
to drive metastasis. Since the key changes driving distant metastasis were reversible
adaptations rather than stochastic genetic changes, there is no reason why these changes
would need to be driven by a single sufficient driver. Adaptive changes might involve
coordinated changes in the expression of multiple enzymes to increase flux through
metabolic pathways. Other metabolic pathways also contribute to the synthesis and
12 13
34
regeneration of NADPH, including the pentose phosphate , and malate pathways. These
pathways could potentially also contribute to the ability of melanoma cells to survive during
metastasis.
Our experiments showed that oxidative stress increases in metastasizing cells as compared to
established subcutaneous tumors and limits distant metastasis. However, we did not test
whether oxidative stress also limits the initiation and early growth of primary cutaneous

melanomas. Thus, transient oxidative stress could occur during the formation of primary
15 18
tumors – in addition to limiting distant metastasis at a later stage of cancer progression.

HHMI Author Manuscript

ROS can cause oncogenic mutations and activate oncogenic pathways, raising the possibility
that treatment with anti-oxidants could suppress the initiation or progression of some
28 35
cancers , . Anti-oxidants or anti-oxidant enzymes suppress cancer initiation in some
36 38
15 17 39
contexts – while increasing cancer initiation in other contexts – , . Increasing dietary
40
antioxidants has generally not reduced cancer incidence in clinical trials . Dietary
supplementation with anti-oxidants actually increased incidence and death from lung and
41 43
prostate cancer – . Dietary supplementation with folate promotes the development and
44 45

progression, at least in melanoma, by promoting metastasis.

METHODS
Obtaining melanomas and enzymatic dissociation

HHMI Author Manuscript

Melanoma specimens were obtained with informed consent from all patients according to
protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Michigan
27
Medical School (IRBMED approvals HUM00050754 and HUM00050085; see ref ) and the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Tumours were dissociated in Sterile
Closed System Tissue Grinders (SKS Science) in enzymatic digestion medium containing
200 U/ml collagenase IV (Worthington) for 20 minutes at 37°C. DNase (50–100 U/ml) was
added to reduce clumping of cells during digestion. Cells were filtered with a 40 μm cell
strainer to obtain a single-cell suspensions.
Cell labeling and sorting

HHMI Author Manuscript

All melanomas used in this study stably expressed DsRed and luciferase so that the
melanoma cells could be unambiguously distinguished from mouse cells by flow cytometry
and by bioluminescence imaging. When isolated by flow cytometry, cells were also stained
with antibodies against mouse CD45 (30-F11-APC, eBiosciences), mouse CD31 (390-APC,
Biolegend), Ter119 (TER-119-APC, eBiosciences) and human HLA-A,B,C (G46-2.6-FITC,
BD Biosciences) in order to select live human melanoma cells and to exclude contaminating
mouse endothelial and haematopoietic cells. Live human melanoma cells were thus isolated
by flow cytometry by sorting cells that were positive for DsRed and HLA and negative for
mouse CD45, Ter119, and CD31. All antibody labeling was performed for 20 minutes on
ice, followed by washing and centrifugation. Prior to flow cytometric analysis, cells were resuspended in staining medium (L15 medium containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml),
1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4)) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; 5 μg/ml; Sigma) to eliminate dead cells from sorts and analyses. Sorts
and analyses were performed using a FACSAria flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). After
sorting, an aliquot of sorted melanoma cells was always reanalysed to check for purity,
which was usually greater than 95%. For analysis of circulating melanoma cells, blood was
collected from each mouse by cardiac puncture with a syringe pretreated with citratedextrose solution (Sigma). Red blood cells were precipitated by Ficoll sedimentation
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Ficoll Paque Plus, GE Healthcare). Remaining

cells were washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) before antibody staining
and flow cytometric analysis. For limiting dilution analysis, cells for each mouse were sorted
into individual wells of 96-well V-bottomed plates containing staining medium and loaded
into syringes directly from the well (one well into one syringe into one mouse).
Transplantation of melanoma cells

HHMI Author Manuscript

After sorting, cells were counted and resuspended in staining medium with 25% highprotein Matrigel (product 354248; BD Biosciences). Subcutaneous injections were
performed into the right flank of NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NOD/SCID
IL2Rγnull or NSG) mice (Jackson Laboratory) in a final volume of 50 μl. Each mouse was
transplanted with 100 melanoma cells unless otherwise specified. Tumour formation was
evaluated regularly by palpation of the injection site, and the subcutaneous tumours were
measured every 10 days until any tumour in the mouse cohort reached 2.5 cm in its largest
diameter. Mice were monitored daily for signs of distress and euthanized according to a
standard body condition score or when their tumours reached 2.5 cm in largest diameter,
whichever came first. We adhered to this limit in all experiments. Organs were analyzed
visually and by bioluminescence imaging (see details below) for presence of
macrometastases and micrometastases. These experiments were performed according to
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center (protocol 2011-0118). Intravenous injections were done
by injecting cells into the tail vein of NSG mice in 100 μl of staining medium. For
intrasplenic injections the mice were anesthetized with isoflourane, then the left flank was
shaved and disinfected with an ethanol wipe and iodine swab. An incision was made into the
intraperitoneal cavity. The spleen was exposed with forceps and cells were injected slowly in
a 40μl volume of staining medium. The peritoneum was then sutured and skin was closed
with clips. Mice were injected with buprenex before surgery and then again 12 hours after
surgery.
Lentiviral transduction of human melanoma cells

HHMI Author Manuscript

A bicistronic lentiviral construct carrying dsRed2 and luciferase (dsRed2-P2A-Luc) was
generated (for bioluminescence imaging) and cloned into the FUW lentivrial expression
construct. The primers that were used for generating this construct were: dsRed2 forward,
5′-CGACTCTAGAGGATCCatggatagcactgagaacgtc-3′ (capital letters indicate homology to
FUW backbone); dsRed2 reverse, 5′TCCACGTCTCCAGCCTGCTTCAGCAGGCTGAAGTTAGTAGCTCCGCTTCCctggaacag

gacgcc aaaaacataaag-3′ (capital letters indicate P2A sequences) and luciferase reverse, 5′GCTTGATATCGAATTCttacacggcgatctttccgc-3′ (capital letters indicate homology to FUW
backbone). All constructs were generated using the In-Fusion HD cloning system (Clontech)
and sequence verified.
For virus production, 0.9 μg of the appropriate plasmid and 1 μg of helper plasmids (0.4 μg
pMD2G and 0.6 μg of psPAX2) were transfected into 293T cells using polyjet (Signagen)
according to the manufacturers instructions. Replication incompetent viral supernatants were

collected 48 hours after transfection and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter. 300,000 freshly
dissociated melanoma cells were infected with viral supernatants supplemented with 10
μg/ml poybrene (Sigma) for 4 hours. Cells were then washed twice with staining medium,
and about 25,000 cells (a mixture of infected and noninfected cells) were suspended in
staining medium with 25% high-protein Matrigel (product 354248; BD Biosciences) then
injected subcutaneously into NSG mice. After growing to 1 to 2 cm in diameter, tumours
were excised and dissociated into single-cell suspensions, and luciferase-dsRed+ or GFP+
cells were collected by flow cytometry for injection into secondary recipients. Metastasis
was monitored by bioluminescence imaging in secondary recipients. All shRNAs were
expressed from a pGIPZ miRNA-based construct with TurboGFP from GE Dharmacon
(Lafayette, Colorado). For ALDH1L2, the following GE Dharmacon shRNA clones were
used: V2LHS_30207, V2LHS_30209. For MTHFD1 the following GE Dharmacon shRNA
clones were used: V2LHS_216208 and V2LHS_196832.
Bioluminescence imaging

HHMI Author Manuscript

Mice were injected with 100 luciferase-dsRed+ cells on the right flank and monitored until
tumour diameters approached 2.5 cm, at which point they were imaged along with an
uninjected control mouse using an IVIS Imaging System 200 Series (Caliper Life Sciences)
with Living Image software. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μl of PBS
containing D-luciferin monopotassium salt (40 μg/ml) (Biosynth) 5 minutes before imaging,
followed by general anesthesia 2 minutes before imaging. After imaging of the whole
mouse, the mice were euthanized and individual organs were surgically removed and
quickly imaged. The exposure time of images ranged from 10 to 60 seconds depending on
signal intensity. The bioluminescence signal was quantified with “region of interest”
measurement tools in Living Image (Perkin Elmer) software. After imaging, tumours and
organs were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for histopathology. For live imaging,
mice were imaged once a month, and whole body bioluminescence was quantified using
Living Image Software (Perkin Elmer).
LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis

HHMI Author Manuscript

Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Subcutaneous tumours and metastatic nodules
were dissected, immediately homogenized in 80% methanol chilled with dry ice
(Honeywell), vortexed vigorously, and metabolites were extracted overnight at −80°C. The
following day, samples were centrifuged at 13,000xg for 15 minutes at 4°C, the supernatant
was collected, and metabolites from the pellet were re-extracted with 80% methanol at
−80°C for 4 hours. After centrifugation, both supernatants were pooled and lyophilized
using a SpeedVac (Thermo). To inhibit spontaneous oxidation, samples were extracted with
47
80% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid in some experiments . Dried metabolites were
reconstituted in 0.03% formic acid in water, vortexed and centrifuged, then the supernatant
was analysed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A
Nexera Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (UHPLC) system (Shimadzu) was
used for LC, with a Polar-RP HPLC column (150 × 2 mm, 4 μm, 80 Å, Phenomenex) and
the following gradient: 0–3 min 100% mobile phase A; 3–15 min 100%–0% A; 15–17 min
0% A; 17–18 min 0%–100% A; 18–23 min 100% A. Mobile Phase A was 0.03% formic
acid in water. Mobile Phase B was 0.03% formic acid in acetonitrile. The flow rate was 0.5

ml/min and the column temperature 35°C. A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB Sciex
48
QTRAP 5500) was used for metabolite detection as previously described . Chromatogram
peak areas were integrated using Multiquant (AB Sciex). To measure GSH and GSSG levels,
some metabolite extractions were performed with 0.1% formic acid in 80% methanol, to
inhibit spontaneous GSH oxidation. To calculate GSH and GSSG amounts, a standard curve
was prepared by adding known quantities of GSH and GSSG to tumour metabolite extracts.
Isotope tracing with [U-13C]glucose

HHMI Author Manuscript
HHMI Author Manuscript

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2g/kg body mass of [U-13C]Glucose (Cambridge
Isotopes) and were analyzed 15, 30, and 60 minutes later. Mice were fasted for 14 hours
prior to the injection. In most experiments, subcutaneous tumours and metastatic nodules
were surgically excised and homogenized in ice cold 50% methanol for GC-MS and in 80%
dry ice cold methanol for LC-MS analysis. Metabolites were extracted with three freezethaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. Supernatant was collected after a 15 minute centrifugation at
13,000xg at 4°C and lyophilized. Metabolites were derivatized with Trimethylsilyl (TMS) at
42°C for 30 minutes for GC-MS analysis. 13C enrichment analysis was performed by GC48
MS as previously described . For LC-MS analysis, lyophilized samples were resuspended
in either 0.03% formic acid in water or in 5 mM Ammonium Acetate in water depending on
the method of analysis. For 13C enrichment analysis of lactate, serine, and glycine by LCMS/MS, we used the LC procedure described above for LC-MS/MS metabolomics analysis
with the following modifications: the LC gradient was 0–3 minute 100% mobile phase A; 3–
15 min 100%–0% A; 15–17 min 0% A; 17–17.5 min 0%–100% A; 17.5–20 min 100% A.
For analysis of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), the LC conditions were: mobile phase A, 5 mM
ammonium acetate in water and mobile phase B, 5 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile,
and a Fusion-RP HPLC column (150 × 2 mm, 4 μm, 80 Å, Phenomenex). The LC gradient
was: 0–3 min 100% mobile phase A; 3–9 minute 100%–0% A; 9–11 minute 0% A; 11–12
minute 0%–100% A; 12–15 minute 100% A. For metabolite detection a triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer (AB Sciex QTRAP 5500) was used on multiple reaction monitoring
48
(MRM) mode as previously described, with some modifications . The following transitions
were used: positive mode: serine 106.1/60 (M+1: 107.1/60 and 107.1/61, M+2: 108.1/61 and
108.1/62, M+3: 109.1/62), glycine 76/30 (M+1 77/30 and 77/31, M+2 78/31); negative
mode: lactate 89/43 (M+1 90/43 and 90/44, M+2 91/44 and 91/45, M+3 92/45), 3-PG
185/79 (M+1 186/79, M+2 187/79, M+3 188/79) and 185/97 (M+1 186/97, M+2 187/97, M
+3 188/97). Unlabeled tissue was used as a negative control to confirm isotopic labeling in
specific transitions.
Flow cytometric analysis of mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial membrane potential and
ROS
Melanomas were generally dissociated enzymatically as described above. Equal numbers of
dissociated cells (500,000–2,000,000) from subcutaneous tumours, Ficoll-depleted blood, or
metastatic nodules were loaded with dyes to assess mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial
membrane potential, and ROS levels. The dyes that were used to assess these parameters
were all obtained from Life Technologies. We stained the dissociated cells for 20–45
minutes at 37°C with 5 μM Mitotracker Green, Mitotracker DeepRed, CellROX Green, or
CellROX DeepRed in HBSS-free (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free) to assess mitochondrial mass,

mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ROS, respectively. For
each indicator, staining intensity per cell was assessed by flow cytometry in live human
melanoma cells (positive for human HLA and dsRed and negative for DAPI and mouse
CD45/CD31/Ter119).
In vivo treatment of xenografts with drugs

HHMI Author Manuscript

All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
(protocol 2011-0118). Unless otherwise stated, 100 freshly dissociated melanoma cells were
injected subcutaneously into the right flanks of NSG mice. When tumours became palpable,
in some experiments mice were injected subcutaneously with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC)
(Sigma, 200 mg/kg/day in 200 μl PBS, pH 7.4) or PBS as a control. Mice were injected with
their last NAC dose 10 minutes before being sacrificed for end point analysis. In
experiments where mice received NAC via the drinking water, NAC was dissolved in PBS at
1mg/ml and the water was changed every 2 days. In other experiments methotrexate (Tocris,
1.25 mg/kg/day in 100 μl PBS) was injected intraperitoneally 5 days per week. Mice that
received methotrexate were simultaneously administered Thymidine (Sigma, 3 mg/
mouse/day in 100 μl PBS) and Hypoxanthine (Sigma, 750 μg/mouse/day in 100 μl PBS) to
prevent suppression of nucleotide biosynthesis. Tumour growth was monitored weekly with
a caliper. Experiments were terminated when any tumour in the cohort reached 2.5 cm in
size. At the end of experiments, blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Organs were
analyzed for micrometastases and macrometastases by bioluminescence imaging and visual
inspection.
NADPH/NADP+ measurement
Subcutaneous tumours or metastatic nodules were surgically excised as quickly as possible
after euthanizing the mice then melanoma cells were mechanically dissociated and NADPH
and NADP+ were measured using NADPH/NADP Glo-Assay (Promega) following the
manufactures instructions. Luminescence was measured using a using a FLUOstar Omega
plate reader (BMG Labtech). Values were normalized to protein concentration, measured
using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo).

Western Blot Analysis
Tissue lysates were prepared in Kontes tubes with disposable pestles using RIPA Buffer
(Cell Signaling Technology) supplemented with phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (Sigma),
and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). The BCA protein assay (Thermo)
was used to quantify protein concentrations. Equal amounts of protein (15–30 μg) were
separated on 4–20% Tris Glycine SDS gels (BioRad) and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (BioRad). Membranes were blocked for 30 minutes at room
temperature with 5% milk in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween20 (TBST) then incubated
with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After incubating with horseradish peroxidase
conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), membranes were developed
using SuperSignal West Pico or Femto chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo). Blots were
stripped with 1% SDS, 25mM glycine (pH 2) before re-probing. The following primary
antibodies were used for western blot analyses:ALDH1L2 (LifeSpan Bio; LS-C178510),

Immunofluorescence staining of frozen tissue sections
Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 hours at 4°C, then transferred to 30%
sucrose for 24 hours for cryoprotection. Tissues were then frozen in OCT. 10μm sections
were permeabilized in PBS with 0.2% Triton (PBT), 3 times for 5 min each, and blocked in
5% goat serum in PBT for 30 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then stained with
primary antibodies overnight: ALDH1L2 (LS-C178510, LifeSpan Bio; 1:50) and S100
(Z0311, Dako, 1:500). The next day, sections were washed in PBS with 0.2% Triton and
stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:500 for 30 minutes in the
dark at room temperature. Sections were washed with PBT with DAPI (1:1000) and
mounted for imaging.
Statistical methods

HHMI Author Manuscript
HHMI Author Manuscript

The data in most figure panels reflect multiple independent experiments performed on
different days using melanomas derived from multiple patients. Variation is always indicated
using standard deviation. For analysis of statistical significance, we first tested whether there
was homogeneity of variation across treatments (as required for ANOVA) using Levene’s
test, or when only two conditions were compared, using the F-test. In cases where the
variation significantly differed among treatments, the data were log2-transformed. If the data
contained zero values, 1/2 of the smallest non-zero value was added to all measurements
before log2 transformation. If the data contained negative values, all measurements were logmodulus transformed (L(x) = sign(x) * log(|x| + 1)). In the rare cases when the transformed
data continued to exhibit variation that significantly differed among treatments, we used a
non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test or a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to assess the
significance of differences among populations and treatments. Usually, variation did not
significantly differ among treatments. Under those circumstances, two-tailed Student’s ttests were used to test the significance of differences between two treatments. When more
than two treatments were compared, a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple
comparisons tests were performed. A two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple
comparisons tests were used in cases where more than two groups were compared with
repeated measures. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean distance in
49
Metaboanalyst .
Mouse cages were randomized between treatments in all in vivo experiments (mice within
the same cage had to be part of the same treatment). No blinding was used in any
experiment. In all xenograft assays we injected 4–8 week old NSG mice, 5 mice per
treatment. Both male and female mice were used. For long-term assays, we injected 10 mice
per treatment to account for non-melanoma related deaths (NSG mice are susceptible to
death from opportunistic infections). When mice died before the end of experiments due to
opportunistic infections the data from those mice were excluded. There were only two
experiments in which this occurred. In Figures 1c and d, 0–4 mice per melanoma line were
found dead due to an opportunistic bacterial infection prior to termination of the experiment

found dead due to opportunistic infections, before the first imaging time point after
transplantation. These mice were excluded from the reported results.

Molecule (MCAM) and Melanoma-associated Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan (MCSP).
Both of the tumors that lacked MCSP staining (M514 and M597) were heavily pigmented
and expressed other melanoma markers (such as S100 and MCAM).

a) Summary of the clinical characteristics of the melanomas used in this study at the time of
banking, as well as patient outcome after banking, and metastasis patterns upon
transplantation of banked tumours into NSG mice. Melanomas were stratified into efficient
and inefficient metastasizers. Efficient metastasizers formed distant metastases in patients
and in NSG mice. Inefficient metastasizers did not form distant metastases in patients or
distant macrometastases in NSG mice. They did form micrometastases in the lung, but not
outside of the lung in the period of time it took for subcutaneous tumours to grow to 2 cm in
27
diameter (when the mice had to be euthanized in these experiments ). Nonetheless, most of
the inefficient metastasizers have the ability to form macrometastases if given enough time
(data not shown). b) Growth rates of subcutaneous tumours in NSG mice after subcutaneous
transplantation of 100 cells. Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed Student’s

melanoma markers (Extended data figure 1) as well as examination by a clinical
dermatopathologist.

a) Live human melanoma cells were identified by flow cytometry based on the expression of
DsRed (all melanomas in this study stably expressed DsRed) and human HLA and the lack
of expression of mouse CD45, CD31 and Ter119 (to exclude mouse hematopoietic and
endothelial cells). Human melanoma cells were observed in the blood of NSG mice bearing
efficiently metastasizing melanomas. b) Mice xenografted with efficiently metastasizing
melanomas (n=43 mice with tumours derived from 4 patients) had significantly higher
frequencies of circulating melanoma cells (CMCs) in their blood than mice xenografted with
inefficiently metastasizing melanomas (n=13 mice with tumours derived from 4 patients) or
control mice that had not been xenografted (n=18 mice). Blood was collected by cardiac

and metastatic tumours from mice with three different melanomas in each experiment
(M405, M481, and UT10). ii and iii) GSH/GSSG ratios from the experiments shown in
panels a and b, respectively. iv) GSH/GSSG ratios in melanoma cells isolated by flow
cytometry from subcutaneous tumours and the blood (CMCs) of mice bearing M405 and
M481. v) Metabolites were extracted in the presence of 0.1% formic acid in two independent
experiments in which melanoma cells were isolated by flow cytometry from subcutaneous
and metastatic tumours (M405 and M481). While the GSH/GSSG ratio was always
significantly higher in melanoma cells from subcutaneous tumours as compared to
circulating cells or metastatic nodules the ratio varied among experiments as a result of
technical differences in cell isolation and metabolite extraction as well as differences in MS
sensitivity to GSH and GSSG. g) GSH/GSSG ratios in subcutaneous tumours that arose
from the transplantation of melanoma cells obtained from subcutaneous tumours or
metastatic nodules, as well as the metastatic nodules from the same mice (M405; n=2 to 3

ratio in metastasizing melanoma cells is reversible upon subcutaneous transplantation. h)

Treatment with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine increased tumour formation by
intravenously transplanted melanoma cells.Limiting dilution analysis of tumour formation
by intravenously transplanted efficiently metastasizing (a, M405, M481, UT10) or
inefficiently metastasizing (b, M528 and M597) melanoma cells. In half the mice, the cells
were pre-treated with NAC prior to transplantation and the mice were maintained on water
supplemented with NAC after transplantation (n=5 mice/treatment/melanoma for a total of
110 mice in 5 independent experiments). Statistical significance was assessed by a chi46
square test using ELDA software
