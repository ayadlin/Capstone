Abstract
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is an effective therapeutic against acute promyelocytic leukemia and certain solid
tumors. Because As2O3 inhibits mitochondrial respiration in leukemia cells, we hypothesized that As2O3 might
enhance the radiosensitivity of solid tumors by increasing tumor oxygenation [partial pressure of oxygen (pO2)]
via a decrease in oxygen consumption. Two murine models of radioresistant hypoxic cancer were used to study
the effects of As2O3. We measured pO2 and the oxygen consumption rate in vivo by electron paramagnetic
resonance oximetry and 19ﬂuorine-MRI relaxometry. Tumor perfusion was assessed by Patent blue staining. In
both models, As2O3 inhibited mitochondrial respiration, leading to a rapid increase in pO2. The decrease in oxygen
consumption could be explained by an observed decrease in glutathione in As2O3-treated cells, as this could
increase intracellular reactive oxygen species that can disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential. When tumors
were irradiated during periods of As2O3-induced augmented oxygenation, radiosensitivity increased by 2.2-fold
compared with control mice. Notably, this effect was abolished when temporarily clamped tumors were
irradiated. Together, our ﬁndings show that As2O3 acutely increases oxygen consumption and radiosensitizes
tumors, providing a new rationale for clinical investigations of As2O3 in irradiation protocols to treat solid tumors.

Introduction
The partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) is a crucial factor in the
response of tumors to irradiation and other cytotoxic treatments. Several studies have shown superior outcomes for
cancer patients whose tumors had lower hypoxic fractions
(1). Tumor hypoxia results from an imbalance between oxygen
delivery and oxygen consumption, either of which may potentially be targeted by therapeutic interventions to transiently
alleviate tumor hypoxia and potentiate cytotoxic treatments. It
has been suggested that modifying oxygen consumption is
more efﬁcient at alleviating hypoxia than modifying oxygen
delivery (2). Several pharmacologic drugs that inhibit cellular
oxygen consumption have been characterized for their
potential to increase tumor oxygenation and thereby enhance

radiosensitivity. Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (3), insulin (4),
anti-inﬂammatory drugs (5), corticoids (6), some antagonists
of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (SU5416 and ZD6474; refs. 7,
8), and thyroid hormones (9) all play a major role in the
metabolism of tumor cells by modifying the rate of oxygen
consumption.
In the 1970s, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) was reported to induce
complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL) in China (10). Additional studies conﬁrmed
that low doses of As2O3 could induce complete remission in
90% of relapsed APL patients (10). Importantly, it has become
evident that the apoptotic effects of As2O3 are not restricted to
APL cells but have also been observed in other malignant cells
in preclinical studies, including myeloma cells, chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and various solid tumors cells, such as
prostate, esophageal, and ovarian carcinomas (11–13).
Arsenic acts on cells through a variety of mechanisms,
inﬂuencing numerous signal transduction pathways and
resulting in a vast range of cellular effects that include apoptosis induction, growth inhibition, promotion, or inhibition of
differentiation and inhibition of angiogenesis (11, 14–16).
As2O3 also seems to inhibit mitochondrial respiratory function
in human leukemia cells (17). We therefore hypothesized that
As2O3 could be an important modulator of tumor oxygenation
in solid tumors by affecting the oxygen consumption of tumor
cells. The ﬁrst step of the study was to monitor pO2 in
experimental tumors using electron paramagnetic resonance

(EPR) oximetry (18) after administration of As2O3 to determine
the window of increased tumor oxygenation. These results
were conﬁrmed by 19ﬂuorine MRI (19F-MRI) oxygen mapping, a
technique that can probe the spatial heterogeneity of response
(19, 20). Patent blue staining (blood ﬂow) and in vitro oxygen
consumption experiments were done to investigate the origin
of the observed increase in pO2. The intracellular glutathione
(GSH) content and the mitochondrial membrane potential
were also evaluated to explain a possible mechanism by which
As2O3 could decrease oxygen consumption. Finally, the window of increased oxygenation was exploited to enhance
response of tumors to radiotherapy. Our study is the ﬁrst
report of the acute effect of As2O3 on oxygen consumption in
solid tumors and provides a new rationale for combining As2O3
with radiotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Tumor model
Two tumor models were implanted by intramuscular injection in the rear leg of male mice: the transplantable mouse liver
tumor (TLT) model in NMRI mice and the Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) in C57Black6N mice. Measurements were done
when the tumor size reached 8.0  1.0 mm. All animal
experiments were conducted in accordance with national
animal care regulations.
Treatments
As2O3 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For the treated
group, As2O3 was dissolved in PBS (Invitrogen) and given by
intraperitoneal injection (5 mg/kg body weight, 100 mL
injected). Control animals were treated with PBS only. Animals
were anesthetized by inhalation of isoﬂurane mixed with air in
a continuous ﬂow (3% induction, 1.8% maintain for a minimum
of 15 minutes before any measurement).
Tumor oxygenation
Electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry. EPR oximetry, using charcoal (CX 0670-1; EM Sciences) as the oxygensensitive probe, was used to evaluate changes in tumor oxygenation after treatment with As2O3, using a protocol
described previously (21). EPR spectra were recorded using
an EPR spectrometer (Magnettech) with a low-frequency
microwave bridge operating at 1.2 GHz and an extended loop
resonator, or using a Bruker Elexsys system with an L-band
microwave bridge working at 1.1 GHz and equipped with an
E540R23 L-Band EPR coil resonator. A suspension of charcoal
was slowly injected into the center of the tumor 1 day before
measurement (100 mg/mL; 70 mL injected, particle size of 1–25
mm; needle diameter, 0.4 mm). The acute effect of As2O3 was
measured by following the tumor pO2 status before and for 2
hours after the single injection.

F-MRI measurements. MRI was done with a 4.7 T,
40-cm inner diameter bore system (Bruker Biospec) and a
tunable 1H/19F surface coil. Parametric images of the spinlattice relaxation time (T1) were estimated using a snapshot
inversion recovery (SNAP-IR) pulse sequence, using a protocol
described previously (19). Hexaﬂuorobenzene (HFB) was

www.aacrjournals.org

slowly injected into the tumor and deposited along 3 tracks
(3  30 mL) encompassing central and peripheral regions.
As2O3 was administered in 5 mice by a catheter and the tumor
pO2s were monitored for 2 hours. Two measurements were
acquired as baseline before injection. The mice used for this
study were different from those used for EPR oximetry.
Patent blue staining
Patent blue (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to obtain a rough
estimate of the TLT tumor perfusion fraction 90 minutes after
administration of As2O3 or PBS, using a protocol described
previously (7, 8). The assay was applied on a separate cohort.
Brieﬂy, this technique involved the injection of 200 mL of Patent
blue solution (1.25%) into the tail vein of the mice, which were
sacriﬁced after 1 minute, with tumors excised and cut into 2
size-matched halves. For each with tumors, the percentage of
stained area of the whole cross section was determined using
an in-house program running on MatLab, used as an indicator
of tumor perfusion fraction.
In vitro evaluation of oxygen consumption rate
TLT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's
medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 4.5 mg/L glucose, and
1% penicillin–streptomycin. Conﬂuent cells were suspended in
medium without serum 2 hours before treatment with As2O3
(25 mmol/L) or PBS. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
EMX EPR spectrometer operating at 9 GHz. Tumor cells (2 
107/mL) were suspended in 10% dextran in complete medium.
A neutral nitroxide, 15N 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidined16-15N-1-oxyl, at 0.2 mmol/L (CDN Isotopes), was added to
100-mL aliquots of tumor cells that were then drawn into glass
capillary tubes. Oxygen consumption rates were obtained by
measuring the pO2 in the closed tube over time and ﬁnding the
slope of the resulting linear plot, using a protocol described
previously (9).
Cell survival assay
Cellular viability was estimated by measuring the activity of
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), both in the culture medium and
in the cell pellet obtained after centrifugation (22). The results
were expressed as the ratio of released activity to total activity.
Tumor regrowth delay assay
The TLT tumor-bearing leg was irradiated locally with 10 Gy
of 250 kV X-rays (RT 250; Philips Medical Systems; 1.2 Gy/min).
The tumor was centered in a 3-cm circular irradiation ﬁeld. A
single-dose irradiation of 10 Gy was given 90 minutes after
injection of As2O3 or PBS. After radiotherapy, tumor growth
was determined daily using a caliper until the diameter
reached 16 mm, at which time the mice were sacriﬁced. A
linear ﬁt was carried out between 8 and 16 mm, which allowed
determination of the time to reach a particular size for each
mouse.
Measurement of intracellular GSH
The glutathione content was determined using the
Tietze enzyme recycling assay (23), with slight modiﬁcations
(24). TLT cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS,

Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential
TLT cells were treated with As2O3 (25 mmol/L) in 6-well
plates. Mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored
using a ﬂuorescent cationic dye known as JC-1 (Sigma Mitochondria Staining Kit). In healthy cells, JC-1 enters the negatively charged mitochondria, where it aggregates and ﬂuoresces red. In cells in which the mitochondrial potential has
collapsed, JC-1 exists as monomers throughout the cell. When
dispersed in this manner JC-1 ﬂuoresces green. Consequently,
mitochondrial depolarization is indicated by a decrease in the
red–green ﬂuorescence intensity ratio (26). Data acquisition
was done using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree
Star, Inc.). Valinomycin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (mCICCP) were used as positive controls (depolarizing agents).
Statistical analysis
Means  SEs were compared using the unpaired Student t
test or ANOVA (multiple comparisons post tests for 3 groups or
more). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
As2O3 rapidly increases tumor oxygenation
The administration of As2O3 at 5 mg/kg induced an acute
increase in pO2 in TLT (Fig. 1A) and LLC (Fig. 1B) tumors, an
effect that was not observed for the control group (Fig. 1A–B)
or for the group treated at 1 mg/kg of As2O3 (data not shown).
After injection of As2O3, the pO2 increased rapidly in TLT and
LLC tumors, after which pO2 decreased, enabling a window of
the increased oxygenation to be determined (Fig. 1). For TLT
tumors, the mean tumor pO2 (measured by EPR oximetry) after
90 minutes was 38.6  7.2 mm Hg for treated mice (n ¼ 6) and
4.3  0.5 mm Hg for controls (n ¼ 6; P < 0.01, t test). For LLC
tumors, the mean pO2 after 45 minutes was 10.5 1.3 mm Hg
for treated mice (n ¼ 5) and 4.3  0.3 mm Hg for control mice
(n ¼ 5; P < 0.01, t test). The effect of 5 mg/kg of As2O3 on pO2 was
further conﬁrmed by 19F-MRI relaxometry in TLT tumors,
which provides an estimation of the temporal and spatial

4.5 mg/L glucose, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Tumor cells
were treated with As2O3 (25 mmol/L) or PBS over a period of 90
minutes for TLT cells. Cells were then washed twice with icecold PBS and then lysed with a solution of 5-sulfosalicylic acid
(5%). After 2 freeze-thaw cycles, samples were centrifuged at
10,000 g for 10 minutes and the resulting supernatants were
kept at 80 C. Ten microliters of the samples was then placed
in a mixture containing 0.2 U/mL of glutathione reductase,
50 mg/mL 5,50 -dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 1 mmol/L
EDTA at pH 7. The reaction was initiated by the addition of
50 mmol/L NADPH, and changes in absorbance were recorded
at 412 nm. GSH and oxidized glutathione were distinguished by
the addition of methyl-2-vinylpyridine, and their respective
concentrations were determined from appropriate standard
curves. Results were normalized to the protein content using
the method of Lowry and colleagues (25).

2.2 mm Hg before the injection of the drug and 30.8  5.5
mm Hg 60 minutes after As2O3 injection (time of maximal pO2,
according to this oximetry technique; P < 0.05, t test, n ¼ 5). The
evolution of pO2 over time, as measured by 19F-MRI relaxometry, is shown in Fig. 2. 19F-MRI relaxometry conﬁrmed the
trend of an early increase in pO2 after As2O3 administration,
although the treated and control dynamic curves were not
signiﬁcantly different due to a large variation in the pO2
readings. Using 19F-MRI relaxometry, it is possible to probe
the spatial heterogeneity of response: color pO2 maps and their
corresponding histograms were generated, as shown in Fig. 3A.
The color maps show an increase in pO2 after treatment with
As2O3, marked by a global increase in the red color (corresponding to pO2 higher than 10 mm Hg). The histograms show
a clear shift of the pO2 values to the right after As2O3 treatment
(n ¼ 5; Fig. 3B). For all further experiments (ﬂow estimation
and therapeutic relevance), the experiments were conducted
90 minutes after injection of As2O3 in mice bearing the TLT
tumor model.

The reoxygenation induced by As2O3 is mediated by an

To explain the increase in pO2 induced by As2O3, blood
perfusion in TLT tumors was investigated using the Patent blue
staining assay 90 minutes after As2O3 injection (Fig. 4A and B).
This method has previously been validated by our group and
compared with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data (6, 7).

was decreased in treated mice. Typical images are shown in Fig.
4B.
The oxygen consumption was investigated in vitro on TLT
tumor cells exposed to As2O3 during 90 minutes. The incubation in the presence of As2O3 signiﬁcantly decreased the rate of
oxygen consumption (Fig. 5), with mean slopes of 1.68  0.07
mmol/L/min (n ¼ 6) and 3.5  0.1 mmol/L/min (n ¼ 7; P <
0.001) for treated and control cells, respectively. As2O3-treated
cells thus consumed oxygen 2 times slower than control cells.
To exclude a possible direct cytotoxic effect of As2O3, we also
measured the activity of LDH in TLT cells 90 minutes and 4
hours after incubation in the presence of As2O3. Treatment
induced LDH leakage of 23.4  2.5% (90 minutes after treatment) and 27  2.1% (4 hours after treatment) compared with
34.1  2.1% and 34.2  2.3% (similar timings) in control mice.
These results indicated that this concentration of As2O3 (25
mmol/L) did not inﬂuence the viability of TLT cells early after
the exposure (1-way ANOVA).

To determine whether the lowering of intracellular GSH
content was a possible mechanism by which As2O3 could
decrease the oxygen consumption of tumor cells, we measured the intracellular content of GSH. GSH contents were
18.3 nmol/mg protein and 42.6 nmol/mg protein for TLTtreated and control cells, respectively (Fig. 6A). Inhibiting
GSH production may lead to oxidative stress by enhancing
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and accumulation of intracellular ROS leads to disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This hypothesis is supported
by the fact that the number of TLT cells with depolarized
mitochondria was increased in the presence of As2O3 as
shown in the JC-1 assay (Fig. 6B).
As2O3 radiosensitizes tumors by an oxygen effect
To evaluate the effect of As2O3 on tumor regrowth after
irradiation, tumor-bearing mice were irradiated with a single
dose of 10 Gy of X-rays. Figure 7A shows the tumor growth of
TLT tumors treated or not with As2O3, with or without
irradiation. In the nonirradiated groups, there was no significant difference between tumors treated with PBS and those
treated with As2O3 (P > 0.05). All irradiated groups showed a
signiﬁcant regrowth delay compared with their respective
control group (P < 0.01). When irradiation was applied during
the time window of increased oxygenation produced by As2O3
administration, the regrowth delay (33.2  2 days to reach 12
mm) was signiﬁcantly increased compared with irradiation
alone (14.8  2.4 days; P < 0.001, 1-way ANOVA, Tukey
multiple comparison test, Fig. 7B), resulting in a 2.2-fold
increase in radiation response. Importantly, tumors were
individually monitored with EPR oximetry after administration
of As2O3 to make sure that the pO2 was increased at the time of
irradiation. To discriminate between an oxygen effect and a
direct radiosensitizing effect, we also irradiated a group of
As2O3-treated mice whose legs had been temporarily ligated to
induce complete hypoxia at the time of irradiation. We

checked the efﬁciency of the ligation by measuring pO2
using EPR oximetry: In these conditions, the tumors were
anoxic [pO2 ¼ 0.1  0.2 mm Hg (n ¼ 3) after leg ligation]. The
regrowth delays were similar for the control irradiated group
and the As2O3 þ hypoxia irradiated group (Fig. 7B). Finally,
in an independent set of mice that were not treated with
As2O3, we found no signiﬁcant difference in regrowth delays
between an irradiated group and a similar group that was
deprived with oxygen at the time of irradiation (by leg
ligation; 12  0.6 days vs. 11.1  0.9 days), indicating that
this tumor model presents a highly hypoxic pattern that is
relevant to study hypoxia-induced radioresistance. As2O3
therefore induces an additional regrowth delay due to an
oxygen effect. In Fig. 7C, we used Kaplan–Meier curves to
compare survival times (times at which mice were sacriﬁced,
when the tumor diameter reached 16 mm) in the different
groups. As2O3 administration combined with radiation
extended the median survival of mice by more than 20 days
compared with control.

Discussion
The major ﬁndings of this study are (i) As2O3 signiﬁcantly

after administration of a single dose; (ii) the early increased

the effectiveness of tumor radiotherapy when irradiation was
performed in the time window of increased oxygenation.
In this study, we report that As2O3 can induce an acute and
transient increase in tumor oxygenation in experimental
tumors. The basal pO2 values and the time window of the
increased oxygenation in TLT tumors measured using EPR and
19
F-MRI relaxometry techniques were not exactly the same.
The differences in observed pO2 readings coming from these
techniques can be partly explained by different factors that
have been discussed in detail in other methodologic publications, including differences in sampling volumes (18–20, 27).
The fact that we used 2 independent sets of tumor-bearing
mice may also explain some differences observed. Despite
differences in the nature of the measurements, both techniques
indicated that the increase in oxygenation was rapidly occurring after As2O3 administration, that it lasted for more than 1
hour, and that this effect was distributed in all areas of the
tumors. A previous study reported an increase in pO2,
measured with an Eppendorf pO2 histograph, after chronic
administration of As2O3 in FSa II tumors; the maximal
increased oxygenation was observed at day 3 (28). The
authors interpreted the As2O3-induced increase in tumor
oxygenation to be related to an increased supply of oxygen to
the remaining viable regions of the tumor and a decrease in
total oxygen demand of the tumor because of the signiﬁcant
amount of cell death involved in As2O3-induced necrosis
(28). As the increased tumor oxygenation may result from an
increase in oxygenation delivery and/or a decrease in oxygen
consumption, we investigated both aspects to determine the
origin of the observed effect responsible for the rapid change
in tumor oxygenation. We showed a decrease in tumor
perfusion after administration of As2O3, which excludes this
parameter as a possible cause of the early tumor reoxygenation. This is in accordance with other studies that showed
that a single dose of As2O3 induced a decrease in perfusion in
tumors (28, 29, 30). Tumor cell oxygen consumption was
reduced signiﬁcantly after exposure to As2O3. We excluded a
possible direct cytotoxic effect of As2O3 by measuring the
activity of LDH in TLT cells after As2O3 exposure. LDH assay
is a well-recognized test used to assess plasma membrane
breakdown as a sign of cytotoxicity. We excluded the MTT
assay because it is dependent on the mitochondrial function
and a clonogenic assay because the effect of As2O3 was rapid
and transient. Our results indicate that the concentration of
As2O3 used in this assay (25 mmol/L) did not inﬂuence the
viability of TLT cells early after the exposure. A mathematical model predicted that modiﬁcation of oxygen consumption would be much more efﬁcient at alleviating hypoxia
than modiﬁcation of oxygen delivery (2), a theoretical
hypothesis that has been extensively shown experimentally
by our group (4–9). Thus, it is theoretically and experimentally possible for tumor oxygenation to improve even in the
face of diminished perfusion (31). In comparison with previously described approaches to target oxygen consumption
in TLT tumors (32), As2O3 induces a higher increase in
oxygenation than all previously considered inhibitors. Also,
the resulting factor of increase in tumor regrowth delay is

above 2, which is superior to the effect observed with the
majority of consumption inhibitors.
The effects of As2O3 on oxygen consumption have already
been observed in vitro by others, and the suggested mechanism was the inhibition of respiration upstream of complex
IV in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (17). Another
mechanism could involve the redox status of the tumor.
The GSH redox system is known to modulate the effects of
As2O3. Previous ﬁndings showed that sensitivity to As2O3induced apoptosis was inversely related to the intracellular
GSH content and that pharmacologic modulation of intracellular GSH content altered sensitivity to As2O3 (33). A
study also showed that As2O3-induced adhesion molecule
expression in vitro was abolished when the antioxidant Nacetyl-cysteine (NAC) was introduced prior to exposure,
whereas the addition of NAC in vivo partially blocked
As2O3-induced vascular shutdown (30). In our study, we
observed a decrease in GSH content in As2O3-treated cells
compared with control cells. This decrease in GSH levels
could explain the inhibitory effect of As2O3 on oxygen
consumption. Indeed, the GSH redox system represents one
of the most important cellular defense systems against
oxidative stress. Inhibiting GSH production may lead to
oxidative stress by enhancing intracellular ROS, and accumulation of intracellular ROS leads to disruption of the
mitochondrial membrane potential (34). This hypothesis is
supported by the fact that the number of TLT cells with
depolarized mitochondria was increased after exposure to
As2O3. It is important to note that changes in oxygen
consumption can occur a long time before changes in
membrane potential become measurable (26). Overall, these
observations indicate that As2O3 could act on the mitochondrial respiratory chain by enhancing intracellular ROS production mediated by decreased GSH levels. Although these
experiments provide rational mechanisms that may explain
the change in oxygen consumption by the tumor cells and
increase in tumor oxygenation, it is important to note that it
is difﬁcult to extrapolate the kinetics of the effects observed
in vivo from these in vitro experiments, as the result will be
dependent on the dynamic evolution in concentration of
As2O3 (perfusion and washout) inside the solid tumor.
We conducted radiosensitizing experiments to test the
therapeutic value of the use of As2O3 in combination with
radiotherapy. There was a signiﬁcant increase in the
response of tumors to radiotherapy (by a factor of 2.2) when
X-ray irradiation was applied during the increased oxygenation window. As2O3 has previously been shown to induce
tumor growth delay and to improve fractionated radiotherapy response in other studies that considered different
mechanisms and timings of administration (28, 29, 35,
36). Lew and colleagues showed a signiﬁcant regrowth delay
after a single dose or fractionated schedule of radiation
when As2O3 was administered 60 minutes after radiation,
explained by the increased production of TNF-a, known to
enhance the antitumor effects of radiation (29). In other
tumor cell lines, it seemed that As2O3 was also able to
directly radiosensitize tumor cells, contrary to our ﬁndings
in TLT cells (36). One area related to As2O3 exposure that has

488

Cancer Res; 72(2) January 15, 2012

been widely studied is the depletion of the GSH level in cells,
which may lead to oxidative stress and has been linked to
increases in radiosensitivity (36, 37). Grifﬁn and colleagues
reported the greatest regrowth delay when combining treatment and radiation every 3 days, at the time of maximal
tumor oxygenation in their model, suggesting that the
oxygen level is an important factor in terms of radiosensitization by As2O3 (28). In these chronic experiments, the
main factor was likely the decrease in oxygen demand due to
the cell death. In this study, the acute increased oxygenation
after administration of a single dose of As2O3 was likely due
to an effect on the mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore,
tumors that were clamped during the irradiation were not
radiosensitized, which identiﬁes the "oxygen effect" as the
major factor responsible for the rapid radiosensitization of
TLT tumors by As2O3, rather than an intrinsic direct radiosensitizing effect of the drug.
It is important to mention that there are large differences
between the dose used in humans and animals. The usual
dose used to treat APL is 0.15 mg/kg/d, and larger doses (up
to 35 mg/kg/d) have been used in phase II clinical trials in
patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma
(38–40). In mice and rats, the usual doses ranged from 2 to 8
mg/kg (28, 30) and generally exceed the doses used in humans.
This is related to the difference in route of administration [i.v. vs.
intraperitoneal (i.p.)] and the good tolerance of mice to As2O3
(the LD50 in mice is 11–11.8 mg/kg i.p), which is linked to a
difference in metabolism. The metabolism of arsenic in humans
produces more toxic methylated arsenic compounds than in
other animals (41). Even at a high dose (6.5 mg/kg), the levels of
As2O3 in brain, kidney, and liver were low and the histologic
examination showed no pathologic changes (42). No obvious
sign of toxicity was observed in studies that investigated the
possible adverse effects of combined treatment with As2O3 and
radiation (43, 44). More information about arsenic toxicity and
pharmacokinetics is available in the ofﬁcial document linked to
the Initial Marketing Authorization of Trisenox (45). Finally, it
has also been shown that As2O3 selectively accumulated in
tumors (28, 29, 41). As the difference in dose is approximately
a 10-fold increased sensitivity to arsenic effects in humans and
as the extrapolation of the animal data to humans is not
straightforward, initial clinical studies that could beneﬁt from
our present observations should likely start with doses currently
used in the clinic to treat APL or solid tumors.
In conclusion, we report for the ﬁrst time that a single dose
of As2O3 can decrease oxygen consumption by tumor cells in
experimental tumors, resulting in a transient increased oxygenation of the tumors. This increased oxygenation window
could be exploited to signiﬁcantly enhance tumor radiation
response, after individual monitoring of the tumor pO2 before
radiotherapy. The oxygen effect was identiﬁed as the major
factor involved in the sensitization process induced by As2O3.
Although additional fractionated radiation studies and TCD50
experiments should be conducted for further preclinical validation in a larger panel of tumor models, our study suggests
that As2O3 could be used as a potential cotreatment for
radiation therapy when this is applied at the time of maximum
increased oxygenation induced by the drug.
