BACKGROUND: Romiplostim is a peptibody protein that augments thrombopoiesis by activating the thrombopoietin
receptor. METHODS: In this phase 2, multicenter, open-label study, 28 thrombocytopenic patients with lower risk
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were assigned to receive romiplostim 750 lg administered subcutaneously either
weekly or biweekly or administered as biweekly intravenous injections for 8 weeks. Patients also could enter a 1-year
study extension phase. RESULTS: At least 1 adverse event was observed in 93% of patients. The most common
adverse events were fatigue and headache (18% for both, and 5 events were grade 3 or 4. There was 1 serious treatment-related adverse event in the biweekly intravenous cohort (hypersensitivity). This hypersensitivity resolved without discontinuation of study treatment. No patients developed neutralizing antibodies or bone marrow fibrosis. Of
the patients who completed 8 weeks of treatment, 57% had a complete platelet response, an additional 8% had a
major platelet response, and 61% did not require a platelet transfusion during this period. Weekly subcutaneous injections achieved the highest mean trough concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The safety and efficacy profiles of romiplostim in this study suggested that weekly subcutaneous administration of 750 lg romiplostim is an appropriate starting

KEYWORDS: myelodysplastic syndromes, romiplostim, thrombocytopenia, thrombopoietin receptor activation.

Clinically important thrombocytopenia is present in 40% to 65% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS),1,2 and hemorrhage contributes to cause of death in 20%. Among patients with lower risk MDS, approximately
50% have thrombocytopenia, 10% have severe thrombocytopenia, and 35% have ever received a platelet transfusion.1,2
Thrombocytopenia also is an associated side effect of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents for
the treatment of MDS.3-7 Currently, platelet transfusions are the only reliably effective treatment option for thrombocytopenia associated with MDS.8 Romiplostim is an Fc-fusion protein that augments thrombopoiesis by binding to and activating the thrombopoietin receptor.9 It is approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic
immune thrombocytopenic purpura who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy.10 Romiplostim is under investigation for thrombocytopenia in patients with International Prognostic Scoring
System (IPSS)11 low-risk or intermediate 1-risk MDS who are not currently receiving disease-modifying treatment

Subcutaneous or IV Romiplostim in MDS/Sekeres et al

(considered ‘‘lower risk’’ MDS) and in patients who have
MDS with grade 3 or 4 treatment-related thrombocytopenia. At weekly subcutaneous doses of 300 to 1500 lg,
romiplostim produced platelet responses in 40% to 50%
of patients with lower risk MDS and severe thrombocytopenia who were not receiving other therapy in a phase 1/2
study in which response was defined using modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria.12,13
In the current study, we evaluated the safety, efficacy,
and pharmacokinetics (PK) of romiplostim (Nplate;
Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif) in thrombocytopenic
patients with lower risk MDS. The study comprised a 4week dose-finding phase (Part A), an 8-week schedulefinding phase (Part B), and a treatment extension phase.
Patients who completed Part A or Part B could continue to
receive weekly romiplostim for up to 1 year in the extension phase. Data from the patients treated in Part A
(including both the 4-week dose-finding phase and the
treatment extension phase) have been reported previously.12 This article reports for the first time on the 8-week
schedule-finding phase and the corresponding treatment
extension phase data for the Part B patients only, including
duration of platelet responses, long-term safety data, and on
the PK profiles of intravenous and subcutaneous dosing
routes. This trial is registered with the National Institutes of
Health as a National Clinical Trial (NCT00303472; http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov; accessed September 28, 2010).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This phase 2, multicenter, open-label study was conducted at 12 centers in the United States and the European Union from March 2007 to May 2008. In Part B,
romiplostim administered at a dose of 750 lg was evaluated in 3 different dosing schedule cohorts: weekly
subcutaneous, biweekly subcutaneous, and biweekly
intravenous administration. Initially, planned enrolment
numbers were 10 patients each for the weekly subcutaneous and biweekly subcutaneous cohorts and 5 patients for
the biweekly intravenous cohort. The biweekly intravenous cohort could be expanded to 10 patients after a
review of the first 3 cohorts by the Safety Review Panel.
Eligible patients were aged 18 years, had a diagnosis of MDS (World Health Organization [WHO] classification),14 had an IPSS low-risk or intermediate 1-risk
score, had thrombocytopenia (ie, mean platelet count 50
 109/L with no individual count >55  109/L), and
were receiving only supportive care. During the study,
romiplostim administration was suspended if a patient had
Cancer

March 1, 2011

a platelet count 600  109/L, and it was resumed after
the platelet count returned to <200  109/L. No randomization scheme was used in the schedule-finding phase of
this study. Patients were assigned in the order 1) weekly
subcutaneous, 2) biweekly subcutaneous, and 3) weekly
intravenous to receive a dose recommended by the Safety
Review Panel based on results from Part A of the study.12
The protocol was reviewed by an institutional ethics
committee or review board at each center and over the
course of the study by all primary investigators through
scheduled teleconferences. The study was conducted in
accordance with applicable regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical
Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent.
The primary endpoint for this 8-week, schedulefinding phase and for the corresponding treatment extension phase for the patients in Part B was cumulative
incidence of adverse events, including antibodies to romiplostim and an increase in blast percentage. Patients were
considered to have progressed to acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) if they met WHO AML criteria14 or subsequently
received treatment for AML. Transient increases in
peripheral and bone marrow blast counts 20% that
resolved within 4 weeks were not considered progression
to AML but were collected as adverse events. The efficacy
endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a complete platelet response (increased platelet count >100 
109/L) or a major platelet response (increase by >30 
109/L). Rescue medication (including platelet transfusions) was administered when patients were at immediate
bleeding risk. Any patient who received platelet transfusions was considered a nonresponder. Platelet counts
obtained within 72 hours of platelet transfusion were
excluded from the evaluation of response. Serum concentration profiles of romiplostim were measured in Part B.
Statistical Analysis
All patients who received at least 1 administration of
romiplostim were included in the safety analysis. The incidence rates for all adverse events that occurred during the
study were summarized by system class and preferred
term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities and severity for each cohort. The efficacy analysis included all enrolled patients who received romiplostim and completed 8 weeks of treatment. Patients were
analyzed according to their assigned treatment schedule.
Response rates were estimated using binomial distribution
along with 95% exact binomial confidence intervals.

Pharmacokinetics
PK parameters of romiplostim in patients with MDS were
measured in Part B of the study and included the estimated initial concentration at time zero (C0) for the intravenous groups, the maximum observed concentration
(Cmax), the time to reach Cmax (tmax), and the area under
the concentration time curve (AUC) from Time 0 to the
last time point with quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t).
Patients in each of the treatment arms were assigned to
have intensive PK measurements as follows: the biweekly
subcutaneous cohort, 5 patients in Week 1 and 7 patients
during Week 7; the weekly subcutaneous cohort, 5
patients in Week 1 and 6 patients in Week 7; and the
biweekly intravenous cohort, 5 patients in Week 1 only.
In the weekly subcutaneous cohort, serum samples for PK
analysis were taken before administration of the first study
dose and at 2 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 120
hours, and 168 hours (Week 1) postdose in Weeks 1 and
7. For the biweekly subcutaneous and biweekly intravenous cohorts, samples were taken before the first study
dose; at 15 minutes (intravenous cohort only) and 30
minutes (intravenous cohort only); and at 2 hours,
24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 120 hours, 168 hours, 192
hours, 240 hours, and 336 hours (14 days) in Week 1
(both the intravenous and subcutaneous cohorts) and in
Week 7 (subcutaneous cohorts only). Variability in PK
sampling among the different dosing cohorts was made
necessary by the different dosing routes and schedules. Intensive PK analyses were assigned for all arms at Week 1
to establish the romiplostim concentration-time profiles.
The weekly cohorts required sampling for 7 days, and the
biweekly cohorts required sampling for 14 days to capture
PK profiles. To capture the rapid decline, the intravenous
cohort needed 2 more early time points than the SC
cohorts.

RESULTS
This study included 28 patients: 11, 12, and 5 patients who
received romiplostim 750 lg weekly subcutaneously, 750
lg biweekly subcutaneously, and 750 lg biweekly intravenously, respectively. Assignment into the biweekly intravenous arm was not expanded after major hypersensitivity
was reported in 1 patient. Twenty-two patients (79%) were
men, and the mean age was 71  8 years. Nineteen patients
(68%) had received platelet transfusions in the past year
and demographic and baseline characteristics among the 3
dosing groups were similar, although slightly more patients
(36%) in the 750 lg weekly subcutaneous cohort had an

994

IPSS score 1.0 (Table 1). Ten patients had platelet counts
that were <20  109/L at baseline.
Twenty-three patients (82%) were included in the
efficacy analysis, because they had received all scheduled
doses (8 weeks) during Part B of the study. One patient
who was evaluated for efficacy completed 8 doses of romiplostim but died before the end of the study and, thus,
was not considered to have completed the study. Six
patients discontinued treatment during Part B, including
1 patient who discontinued because of an adverse event
(treatment-related papular rash), 1 patient who discontinued because of disease progression to AML, 1 patient
withdrew consent, there was 1 death, and 2 patients discontinued because of rising blast counts (Fig. 1).
Six of 11 patients who entered the treatment extension completed the year-long extension. The reasons for
study discontinuation during the treatment extension
were administrative decision (2 patients), consent withdrawn (1 patient), report of disease progression to AML
(1 patient unconfirmed increase in blasts), and other (1
patient who transferred into another romiplostim extension study).
Ninety-three percent of all patients had at least 1
adverse event (Table 2). No patient reported a grade 3 or
higher treatment-related adverse event. No neutralizing
antibodies to romiplostim or to thrombopoietin were
detected. Serious adverse events were reported in 5
patients (18%). These events were cardiac arrest, cerebral
infarction, chest pain, coronary artery dissection, febrile
neutropenia, Herpes zoster infection, hypersensitivity,
mucosal inflammation, pneumonia, rectal hemorrhage,
acute renal failure, Staphylococcal infection, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The cardiac arrest and cerebral infarction occurred in nonresponding patients. One patient
in the biweekly intravenous cohort had a treatmentrelated, serious adverse event of hypersensitivity (allergic
reaction) to 2 romiplostim infusions that resolved without
discontinuation of study treatment. That patient was
switched to subcutaneous injections and experienced no
further reactions. One patient died of subarachnoid hemorrhage (not treatment-related).
Five blood and lymphatic system adverse events
were recorded, including 3 episodes of neutropenia, 1 episode of leukocytosis, and 1 episode leukopenia; none were
treatment-related. The incidence of treatment-related
adverse events was 18%, and none occurred during the
treatment extension. There were no episodes of thromboembolic events related to romiplostim and no adverse
events of reticulin or fibrosis of the bone marrow.

Two patients (7%) experienced an increased blast
percentage on study. One patient who progressed to AML
during Part B had refractory anemia with excess blasts
(baseline IPSS score, 1.5; this score was documented as
0.5 at enrollment and revised at central review). The
patient discontinued treatment 1 week after receiving the
third weekly subcutaneous romiplostim injection, when a
bone marrow blast count of 25% was recorded. No further bone marrow evaluations were available. A second
patient who had an unconfirmed increase in blasts during
the extension had received 750 lg romiplostim biweekly
subcutaneously for 18 weeks. Two weeks after receiving
the last dose, the bone marrow blast count was 30%.
Of the 23 patients who completed 8 weeks of treatment, 15 patients (65%) experienced a complete or major

platelet response, and higher rates of response were
observed in patients who had higher baseline platelet
counts (Table 3). Only 39% received platelet transfusions.
Overall, 7 patients (30%) achieved a durable platelet
response (defined according to IWG criteria). We did not
observe any difference in response to romiplostim when
patients from different subgroups were compared on IPSS
risk scores, French-American-British classification, and
baseline platelet counts. There was no evidence that the
dose or route of administration had a clinically significant
effect on platelet counts (Fig. 2). There was an apparent
drop in the median platelet count in the weekly subcutaneous arm from Week 8 to Week 9; however, patient
numbers declined, and there was overlap between the
interquartile ranges at the 2 time points. The 3 patients

who discontinued drug during this time were all responders. These patients had platelet counts >100  109/L but
did not continue into the extension study. The platelet
counts for the remaining patients were >20  109/L.
Blood samples (n ¼ 327) were collected for PK analysis from 28 patients. Mean concentration-time profiles after
the first dose were higher than the Week 7 dose (Fig. 3).
Patients in the weekly subcutaneous cohort achieved the
highest exposure, as indicated by mean profiles (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
Thrombocytopenia affects a substantial proportion of
patients with lower risk MDS, and >33% receive a platelet transfusion at some point during their disease course.1
Unfortunately, most agents that have activity in patients
with lower risk MDS target hematologic improvements

along erythroid lines, leaving these patients without viable
options other than platelet transfusions for treating
profound or symptomatic thrombocytopenia, with the
accompanying risk of alloimmunization and ultimate lack
of response over time. Thrombopoietic growth factors,
thus, represent promising therapies for this subpopulation
of patients.
In the current study, we evaluated the safety, efficacy, and PK profile of romiplostim in thrombocytopenic
patients with lower risk MDS. The results verified a previous report on the efficacy of romiplostim in lower risk
patients and demonstrated for the first time the efficacy of
a variety of routes and schedules of administration. The
majority of patients (65%) in our study achieved a complete or major platelet response, and higher response rates
were observed in patients who had higher baseline platelet
counts, substantiating published MDS prognostic scoring

Mean (standard deviation) serum romiplostim concentration-versus-time profiles are illustrated after weekly (QW) subcutaneous (SC) (SC/QW), biweekly (Q2W) subcutaneous (SC/Q2W), and biweekly intravenous (IV/Q2W) dosing of 750 lg romiplostim (Left) during Week 1 and (Right) during Week 7. Week 7 intensive pharmacokinetics (PK) were not available for the IV/
Q2W cohort, because assignment was discontinued into that treatment arm.

systems, which indicate that the degree of thrombocytopenia may indicate a more serious MDS.2
We also report on the durability of responses, which
hint at more prolonged responses with weekly subcutaneous dosing, with a 2-fold greater duration of response

than biweekly dosing, although this finding needs to be
substantiated in larger studies. Figure 2 illustrates that
platelet counts rose to substantial (although not quite normal) levels for most patients. However, as indicated by
IWG response criteria, thrombocytopenic patients do not

need to achieve normal platelet levels to derive clinical
and quality-of-life benefit from a therapeutic intervention. They just need to achieve platelet levels that obviate
transfusions and lower risks of spontaneous or traumatic
bleeding.
In the current study, the majority of patients (61%)
did not need to receive platelet transfusions. Reduced platelet transfusions and bleeding events were observed in
patients who achieved durable platelet responses.12 These
responses were observed in patients independent of their
baseline platelet count. Patients who experienced durable
platelet responses had fewer clinically relevant bleeding
events and fewer platelet transfusions, as reported in Part
A of the study.12
Although most patients had at least 1 adverse
event; the most common and serious adverse events
were consistent with those in a similar populations of
patients with MDS who received treatment with romiplostim or other agents.6,12,15 Serious adverse events
included those that are anticipated in an MDS population and that we did not believe were related to study
drug. It is noteworthy that there were no episodes of
thromboembolic events related to romiplostim, and no
adverse events of reticulin or fibrosis of the bone marrow were reported. Two episodes of an increase in blast
percentage did occur in study patients in this single
arm, schedule-finding phase. Six patients discontinued
the study before the extension phase, some because of
disease progression. Although this may represent natural disease evolution, particularly in the subset of lower
risk patients with thrombocytopenia (who may represent a somewhat higher risk subset of the lower risk
population), the safety of long-term romiplostim treatment will be monitored in an ongoing, single-arm,
open-label extension study and in an ongoing, placebocontrolled study. The results from our ongoing, placebo-controlled clinical study will help determine the
appropriate use of romiplostim in patients with lowrisk and intermediate 1-risk MDS patients along with
predictors of response.
PK studies indicated that the mean concentrationtime profiles after the first dose were higher than the
Week 7 dose, which is consistent with target-mediated
disposition, because the platelet counts were higher in
Week 7, and thrombopoietin receptors on platelets presumably serve as a mechanism for romiplostim clearance.16 In summary, the safety, efficacy, and PK data
described here support further clinical study of romiplostim in patients with MDS. On the basis of the safety and

efficacy results reported herein, the starting dose recommendation for this patient population is subcutaneous
romiplostim once weekly at a dose of 750 lg.
