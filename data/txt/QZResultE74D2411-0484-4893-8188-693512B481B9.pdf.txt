SUMMARY

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Just as reference genome sequences revolutionized human genetics, reference maps of interactome
networks will be critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. Here, we describe
a systematic map of ~14,000 high-quality human binary protein-protein interactions. At equal
quality, this map is ~30% larger than what is available from small-scale studies published in the
literature in the last few decades. While currently available information is highly biased and only
covers a relatively small portion of the proteome, our systematic map appears strikingly more
homogeneous, revealing a “broader” human interactome network than currently appreciated. The
map also uncovers significant inter-connectivity between known and candidate cancer gene
products, providing unbiased evidence for an expanded functional cancer landscape, while
demonstrating how high quality interactome models will help “connect the dots” of the genomic
revolution.

INTRODUCTION
Since the release of a high-quality human genome sequence a decade ago (International
Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004), our ability to assign genotypes to
phenotypes has exploded. Genes have been identified for most Mendelian disorders
(Hamosh et al., 2005) and over one hundred thousand alleles have been implicated in at least
one disorder (Stenson et al., 2014). Hundreds of susceptibility loci have been uncovered for

numerous complex traits (Hindorff et al., 2009) and the genomes of a few thousand human
tumors have been nearly fully sequenced (Chin et al., 2011). This genomic revolution is
poised to generate a complete description of all relevant genotypic variations in the human
population.
Genomic sequencing will however, if performed in isolation, leave fundamental questions
pertaining to genotype-phenotype relationships unresolved (Vidal et al., 2011). The causal
changes that connect genotype to phenotype remain generally unknown, especially for
complex trait loci and cancer-associated mutations. Even when identified, it is often unclear
how a causal mutation perturbs the function of the corresponding gene or gene product. To
“connect the dots” of the genomic revolution, functions and context must be assigned to
large numbers of genotypic changes.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Complex cellular systems formed by interactions among genes and gene products, or
interactome networks, appear to underlie most cellular functions (Vidal et al., 2011). Thus, a
full understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships in human will require mechanistic
descriptions of how interactome networks are perturbed as a result of inherited and somatic
disease susceptibilities. This in turn will require high quality and extensive genome and
proteome-scale maps of macromolecular interactions such as protein-protein interactions
(PPIs), protein-nucleic acid interactions, and post-translational modifiers and their targets.
First-generation binary PPI interactome maps (Rual et al., 2005; Stelzl et al., 2005) have
already provided network-based explanations for some genotype-phenotype relationships,
but they remain incomplete and of insufficient quality to derive accurate global
interpretations (Figure S1A). There is a dire need for empirically-controlled (Venkatesan et
al., 2009) high-quality proteome-scale interactome reference maps, reminiscent of the highquality reference genome sequence that revolutionized human genetics.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The challenges are manifold. Even considering only one splice variant per gene,
approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes (Kim et al., 2014; Wilhelm et al., 2014) must be
handled and ~200 million protein pairs tested to generate a comprehensive binary reference
PPI map. Whether such a comprehensive network could ever be mapped by the collective
efforts of small-scale studies remains uncertain. Computational predictions of protein
interactions can generate information at proteome scale (Zhang et al., 2012) but are
inherently limited by biases in currently available knowledge used to infer such interactome
models. Should interactome maps be generated for all individual human tissues using
biochemical co-complex association data, or would ‘context-free’ information on direct
binary biophysical interaction for all possible PPIs be preferable? To what extent would
these approaches be complementary? Even with nearly complete, high-quality reference
interactome maps of biophysical interactions, how can the biological relevance of each
interaction be evaluated under physiological conditions? Here, we begin to address these
questions by generating a proteome-scale map of the human binary interactome and
comparing it to alternative network maps.

Vast uncharted interactome zone in literature

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate whether small-scale studies described in the literature are adequate to
qualitatively and comprehensively map the human binary PPI network, we assembled all
binary pairs identified in such studies and available as of 2013 from seven public databases
(Figure S1B, see Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 1). Out of the 33,000 literature
binary pairs extracted, two thirds were reported in only a single publication and detected by
only a single method (Lit-BS pairs), thus potentially presenting higher rates of curation
errors than binary pairs supported by multiple pieces of evidence (Lit-BM pairs; Tables
S1A, S1B and S1C) (Cusick et al., 2009). Testing representative samples from both of these
sets using the mammalian protein-protein interaction trap (MAPPIT) (Eyckerman et al.,
2001) and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) (Dreze et al., 2010) assays, we observed that Lit-BS pairs
were recovered at rates that were only slightly higher than the randomly selected protein
pairs used as negative control (random reference set; RRS) and significantly lower than LitBM pairs (Figure 1A and Table S2A; see Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 2).
Lit-BS pairs co-occurred in the literature significantly less often than Lit-BM pairs as
indicated by STRING literature mining scores (Figure 1A and Figure S1C; see Extended
Experimental Procedures, Section 2) (von Mering et al., 2003), suggesting that these pairs
were less thoroughly studied. Therefore, use of binary PPI information from public
databases should be restricted to interactions with multiple pieces of evidence in the
literature. In 2013 this corresponded to 11,045 high-quality protein pairs (Lit-BM-13), more
than an order of magnitude below current estimates of the number of PPIs in the full human
interactome (Stumpf et al., 2008; Venkatesan et al., 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The relatively low number of high-quality binary literature PPIs may reflect inspection
biases inherent to small-scale studies. Some genes such as RB1 are described in hundreds of
publications while most have been mentioned only in a few (e.g. the un-annotated C11orf21
gene). To investigate the effect of such biases on the current coverage of the human
interactome network, we organized the interactome search space by ranking proteins
according to the number of publications in which they are mentioned (Figure 1B).
Interactions between highly studied proteins formed a striking “dense zone” in contrast to a
large sparsely populated zone, or “sparse zone”, involving poorly studied proteins.
Candidate gene products identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or
associated with Mendelian disorders distribute homogeneously across the publicationranked interactome space (Figure 1B and Figure S1D), demonstrating a need for unbiased
systematic PPI mapping to cover this uncharted territory.
A proteome-wide binary interactome map
Based on literature-curated information, the human interactome appears to be restricted to a
narrow dense zone, suggesting that half of the human proteome participates only rarely in
the interactome network. Alternatively, the zone that appears sparse in the literature could
actually be homogeneously populated by PPIs that have been overlooked due to sociological
or experimental biases.

To distinguish between these possibilities and address other fundamental questions outlined
above, we generated a new proteome-scale binary interaction map. By acting on all four
parameters of our empirically-controlled framework (Venkatesan et al., 2009), we increased
the coverage of the human binary interactome with respect to our previous human
interactome dataset obtained by investigating a search space defined by ~7,000 proteincoding genes (“Space I”) and published in 2005 (HI-I-05) (Rual et al., 2005) (Figures 1C
and 1D; see Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 3). A search space consisting of all
pairwise combinations of proteins encoded by ~13,000 genes (“Space II”; Table S2B) was
systematically probed, representing a 3.1-fold increase with respect to the HI-I-05 search
space. To gain in sensitivity, we performed the Y2H assay in different strain backgrounds
that showed increased detection of pairs of a positive reference set (PRS) composed of highquality pairs from the literature without increasing the detection rate of RRS pairs. To
increase our sampling, the entire search space was screened twice independently. Pairs
identified in this first pass were subsequently tested pairwise in quadruplicate starting from
fresh yeast colonies. To ensure reproducibility, only pairs testing positive at least three times
out of the four attempts and with confirmed identity were considered interacting pairs,
resulting in ~14,000 distinct interacting protein pairs.

We validated these binary interactions using three binary protein interaction assays that rely
on different sets of conditions than the Y2H assay: i) reconstituting a membrane-bound
receptor complex in mammalian cells using MAPPIT, ii) in vitro using the well-based
nucleic acid programmable protein array (wNAPPA) assay (Braun et al., 2009;
Ramachandran et al., 2008), and iii) reconstituting a fluorescent protein in Chinese hamster
ovary cells using a protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) (Nyfeler et al., 2005)
(see Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 4). The Y2H pairs exhibited validation
rates that were statistically indistinguishable from a PRS of ~500 Lit-BM interactions while
significantly different from an RRS of ~700 pairs with all three orthogonal assays and over a
large range of score thresholds (Figure 1D, Tables S2A and S2C), demonstrating the quality
of the entire dataset. Using three-dimensional co-crystal structures available for protein
complexes in the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000) and for domain-domain
interactions (Stein et al., 2011) (Figure S2, Tables S2D, S2E and S2F; see Extended
Experimental Procedures, Sections 5 and 6), we also demonstrated that our binary
interactions reflect direct biophysical contacts, a conclusion in stark contrast to a previous
report suggesting that Y2H interactions are inconsistent with structural data (Edwards et al.,
2002). Our results also suggested that Y2H sensitivity correlates with the number of residueresidue contacts and thus presumably with interaction affinity. The corresponding human
interactome dataset covering Space II and reported in 2014 (HI-II-14; Table S2G) is the
largest experimentally-determined binary interaction map yet reported, with 13,944
interactions amongst 4,303 distinct proteins.
Overall biological significance
To assess the overall functional relevance of HI-II-14, we combined computational analyses
with a large-scale experimental approach. We first measured enrichment for shared Gene
Ontology (GO) terms and phenotypic annotations and observed that HI-II-14 shows
significant enrichments that are similar to those of Lit-BM-13 (Figures 2A and 2B; see

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 November 20.

Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 7). Second, we measured how much binary
interactions from HI-II-14 reflect membership in larger protein complexes as annotated in
CORUM (Ruepp et al., 2010) or reported in a co-complex association map (Woodsmith and
Stelzl, 2014). In both cases, we observed a significant enrichment for binary interactions
between protein pairs that belong to a common complex (P < 0.001; Figure 2B). Third, we
performed a similar analysis using tissue-specific mRNA expression data across the 16
human tissues of the Illumina Human Body Map 2.0 project as well as cellular compartment
localization annotations from the GO Slim terms. Again, HI-II-14 was enriched for
interactions mediated by protein pairs present in at least one common compartment or cell
type (Figures 2C and 2D). Finally, we measured the overlap of HI-II-14 with specific
biochemical relationships, as represented by kinase-substrate interactions. Both HI-II-14 and
Lit-BM-13 contained significantly more PPIs reflecting known kinase-substrate
relationships (Hornbeck et al., 2012) than the corresponding degree-controlled randomized
networks (Figure 2E). In addition, HI-II-14 tends to connect tyrosine and serine/threonine
kinases (Manning et al., 2002) to proteins with tyrosine or serine/threonine phospho-sites
(Hornbeck et al., 2012; Olsen et al., 2010), respectively (Figure S3A), pointing to the
corresponding interactions being genuine kinase-substrate interactions. In short, our
systematic interactome map, which was generated independently from any pre-existing
biological information, reveals functional relationships at levels comparable to those seen
for the literature-based interaction map.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further investigate the overall biological relevance of HI-II-14, we used an experimental
approach that compares the impact of mutations associated with human disorders to that of
common variants with no reported phenotypic consequences on biophysical interactions
(Figure 3). Our rationale is that a set of interactions corresponding to genuine functional
relationships should more likely be perturbed by disease-associated mutations than by
common variants. The following example will illustrate this concept. Mutations R24C and
R24H in CDK4 are clearly associated with melanoma by conferring resistance to CDKN2A
inhibition (Wölfel et al., 1995), whereas N41S and S52N mutations are of less clear clinical
significance (Zhong et al., 2009) and have remained functionally uncharacterized. HI-II-14
contains five CDK4 interactors: two inhibitors (CDKN2C and CDKN2D), two cyclins
(CCND1 and CCND3), and HOOK1, a novel interacting partner and a potential
phosphorylation target of CDK4 (Figure S3B). In agreement with previous reports the
comparative interaction profile shows that R24C and R24H, but not N41S and S52N,
specifically perturb CDK4 binding to CDKN2C (Figure 3).
In total, we identified 32 human genes for which: (i) the corresponding gene product is
reported to have binary interactors in HI-II-14, (ii) germline disease-associated mutations
have been reported, and (iii) common coding variants unlikely to be involved in any disease
have been identified in the 1,000 genomes project (1000 Genomes Project Consortium,
2012). To avoid over-representation of certain genes, we selected a total of 115 variants,
testing up to 4 disease and 4 common variants per disease gene for their impact on the
ability of the corresponding proteins to interact with known interaction partners (see
Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 8). Disease variants were 10-fold more likely to
perturb interactions than non-disease variants (Figure 3 and Table S3). Strikingly, more than

55% of the 107 HI-II-14 interactions tested were perturbed by at least one disease-associated
variant, and the same trend was observed when considering only mutants with evidence of
expression in yeast as indicated by their ability to mediate at least one interaction (Figure
S3C). Examples of novel specifically-perturbed interactions include AANAT-BHLHE40
and RAD51D-IKZF1 (Figure 3). In the first case, the A129T mutation in AANAT is known
to be associated with a delayed sleeping phase syndrome, and specifically perturbs an
interaction between AANAT and BHLHE40, the product of a gene reported to function in
circadian rhythm regulation (Nakashima et al., 2008). In the second case, the breast cancer
associated RAD51D E233G mutation perturbs interactions with a number of partners,
including the known cancer gene product IKZF1 (Futreal et al., 2004).
Altogether these computational and experimental results provide strong evidence that HIII-14 pairs correspond to biologically relevant interactions and represent a valuable resource
to further our understanding of the human interactome and its perturbations in human
disease.
A “broader” interactome

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Unlike literature-curated interactions, HI-II-14 protein pairs are distributed homogeneously
across the interactome space (Figure 4A), indicating that sociological biases, and not
fundamental biological properties, underlie the existence of a densely populated zone in the
literature. Since 1994, the number of high-quality binary literature PPIs has grown roughly
linearly to reach ~10,000 interactions in 2013 (Figure 4B), while systematic datasets are
punctuated by a few large-scale releases. Although the sparse territory of the literature map
gradually gets populated, interaction density in this zone continues to lag behind that of the
dense zone (Figure 4B). In terms of proteome coverage, the expansion rate is faster for
systematic maps than for literature maps, especially in the sparse territory (Figure 4C and
Figure S4A; see Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 9). While Lit-BM-13 provides
more information in the dense zone, HI-II-14 reveals interactions for more than 2,000
proteins absent from Lit-BM-13. These observations are likely due to a tendency of the
literature map to expand from already connected proteins (Figure 4D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To more deeply explore the heterogeneous coverage of the human interactome, we
compared HI-II-14 and Lit-BM-13 to a collection of ~25,000 predicted binary PPIs of highconfidence (PrePPI-HC) (Zhang et al., 2012) and a co-fractionation map of ~14,000
potentially binary interactions (Co-Frac) (Havugimana et al., 2012). We tested the extent to
which these two datasets contain binary interactions (see Extended Experimental
Procedures, Section 10). Representative samples from both Co-Frac and PrePPI-HC were
recovered by Y2H at a much lower rate than a sample of Lit-BM-13 and appeared
statistically indistinguishable from random pairs (Figure 5A and Table S4A). A literature
non-binary dataset (Lit-NB-13) performed similarly. However, Co-Frac and PrePPI-HC,
like Lit-NB-13, were both significantly enriched for functionally relevant relationships.
Thus, although these datasets represent potentially valuable resources, both Co-Frac and
PrePPI-HC appear to be more comparable to non-binary than to binary datasets.
Surprisingly, even though PrePPI-HC and Co-Frac systematically surveyed the full human
proteome and map different portions of the interactome (Figures S4B), both exhibit a strong

tendency to report interactions amongst well-studied proteins (Figure 5B). This bias is likely
due to the integration of functional annotations in the generation of both datasets.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because coverage might depend on gene expression levels, we also examined interactome
maps for expression-related sparse versus dense zones. Co-Frac shows a strong bias towards
interactions involving proteins encoded by genes highly expressed in the cell lines used
(Figure 5B). This expression-dependent bias is echoed in the literature map, perhaps
reflecting a general tendency to study highly expressed proteins. In contrast, both HI-II-14
and PrePPI-HC exhibit a uniform interaction density across the full spectrum of expression
levels, likely explained by the standardized expression of proteins tested in Y2H and by the
independence of homology-based predictions from expression levels.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We more broadly explored the intrinsic biases that might influence the appearance of
sparsely populated zones by examining 21 protein or gene properties, roughly classified as
expression-, sequence-, or knowledge-based (Figures 5B and 5C, Tables S4B and S4C; see
Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 9). For example, PrePPI-HC is virtually devoid
of interactions between proteins lacking Pfam domains, consistent with conserved domains
forming the basis of the prediction method. HI-II-14 appears depleted of interactions
amongst proteins containing predicted transmembrane helices, consistent with expected
limitations of the Y2H assay (Stagljar and Fields, 2002). Co-Frac is similarly depleted in
interactions involving proteins with transmembrane helices, which may result from
membrane-bound proteins being filtered out during biochemical fractionations. Compared to
HI-II-14, HI-I-05 presented a less homogenous coverage of the space with respect to
abundance and knowledge properties, likely reflecting the content of early versions of the
hORFeome (Figure S4C). Importantly, no single map appeared unbiased in all 21 examined
properties. A combined map presented a slightly increased homogeneity although intrinsic
knowledge biases of the three maps using literature-derived evidence were still predominant.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To confirm that HI-II-14 interactions found in the sparse zones of the three other maps are
of as high quality as those found in dense zones, we compared MAPPIT validation rates and
functional enrichment across these zones for all protein properties examined. MAPPIT
validation rates of dense and sparse zone pairs were consistent for nearly all properties
(Figure 5D and Figure S4D), indicating that HI-II-14 interactions are of similar biophysical
quality throughout the full interactome space. Functional enrichment within the sparse zone
was statistically indistinguishable from that of the dense zone (Figure 5D and Figure S4E),
demonstrating the functional importance of HI-II-14 biophysical interactions in zones
covered sparsely by other types of interactome maps.
Considering all current maps, more than half of the proteome is now known to participate in
the interactome network. Our systematic exploration of previously uncharted territories
dramatically expands the interactome landscape, suggesting that the human interactome
network is broader in scope than previously observed, and that the entire proteome may be
represented within a fully mapped interactome.

Interactome network and cancer landscape

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Genes associated with the same disease are believed to be preferentially inter-connected in
interactome networks (Barabási et al., 2011; Vidal et al., 2011). However, in many cases,
these observations were made with interactome maps that are composites of diverse
evidence, e.g. binary PPIs, co-complex memberships and functional associations, a situation
further complicated by the uneven quality and sociological biases described above. Using
HI-II-14, we revisited this concept for cancer gene products. Our goal was to investigate
whether the cancer genomic landscape is limited to the known cancer genes curated in the
Sanger Cancer Gene Census (Futreal et al., 2004) (“Cancer Census”), or if, alternatively, it
might extend to some of the hundreds of additional candidate genes enriched in somatic
mutations uncovered by systematic cancer genome sequencing (“SM genes”) (Chin et al.,
2011) and/or identified by functional genomic strategies such as Sleeping Beauty
transposon-based screens in mice (“SB genes”) (Copeland and Jenkins, 2010) or global
investigations on DNA tumor virus targets (“VT genes”) (Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2012).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given our homogeneous coverage of the space for known (Cancer Census genes) and
candidate (SB, SM and VT genes) cancer genes (Figure 6A), we first tested the postulated
central role of cancer gene products in biological networks (Barabási et al., 2011) and
verified that both sets tend to have more interactions and to be more central in the systematic
map than proteins not associated with cancer (Figure 6B). We then examined the interconnectivity of known cancer proteins and showed that Cancer Census gene products
interact with each other more frequently than expected by chance, a trend not apparent in
HI-I-05 (Figure 6C). We sought to use this topological property as the basis for novel cancer
gene discovery in the large lists of cancer candidates from genomic and functional genomic
screens.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We examined whether products of candidate cancer genes identified in GWAS (Table S5A)
tend to be connected to Cancer Census proteins, and observed significant connectivity in all
four maps (Figure S5A; see Extended Experimental Procedures, Section 11). When loci
containing a known cancer gene were excluded, only HI-II-14 showed such connectivity,
supporting its unique value to identify cancer candidate genes beyond those already well
demonstrated (Figure 7A and Figure S5A). In further support of their association with
cancer, genes in cancer GWAS loci prioritized by “guilt-by-association” in HI-II-14 tend to
correspond to cancer candidates from systematic cancer studies (Figures 7B and 7C). These
results suggest that cancer-associated proteins tend to form subnetworks perturbed in
tumorigenesis, and that HI-II-14 provides new context to prioritize cancer genes from
genome-wide studies.
The following example illustrates the power of our combined approach. C-terminal Binding
Protein 2 (CTBP2) is encoded at a locus associated with prostate cancer susceptibility
(Thomas et al., 2008) and belongs to both SB and VT gene lists (Mann et al., 2012;
Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2012). Two Cancer Census genes, IKZF1 and FLI1, encode
interacting partners of CTBP2 in HI-II-14. These are transcription factors with tumor
suppressor (Payne and Dovat, 2011) and proto-oncogene (Kornblau et al., 2011) roles,
respectively, in lymphoid tumors. Given its interactions with IKZF1 and FLI1, we

investigated the potential role of CTBP2 in lymphoid tumorigenesis. In the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (Barretina et al., 2012), FLI1 was significantly more often amplified in
lymphoid than in other cell lines (Figure 7D), consistent with its proposed proto-oncogenic
role in these tumors. In contrast, both CTBP2 and IKZF1, but not CTBP1, were deleted
significantly more often in lymphoid cancer cell lines. Notably, deletion of CTBP2 or IKZF1
and amplification of FLI1 were mostly non-overlapping in the different cell lines, suggesting
that either event may be sufficient to affect tumorigenesis (Figure S5B). Altogether, these
results suggest a role for CTBP2 in suppressing lymphoid tumors by direct repression of
FLI1 function, potentially involving IKZF1.

Finally, we assessed how HI-II-14 interactions can be integrated with genomic and
functional genomic datasets. Going beyond the “guilt-by-profiling” concept, we also used
these gene sets in “guilt-by-association” predictions in a combined model (Figure S6A),
which leads to substantially improved cancer gene rankings over those found using either
predictive strategy alone (Figure 7E, Figures S6B and S6C, Table S5B; see Extended
Experimental Procedures, Section 12). In contrast, a similar analysis using HI-I-05
interactions showed that its limited size prevented inclusion of any guilt-by-association
terms (Figure S6D). Genes significantly mutated in cancer patients from recent TCGA pancancer mutation screens (Table S5C) (Lawrence et al., 2014) were enriched amongst highly
ranked predictions from the combined model (P = 6 × 10−3, one-sided Wilcoxon rank test),
supporting the validity of our integrated cancer gene predictions. Our top-ranked prediction
was the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), a well-known cancer gene product. Four other
genes from the Cancer Census list appeared among the top 25 ranked genes. Strikingly,
STAT3, which ranked third, was added to the Cancer Census after our training set was
established, highlighting the ability of this approach to identify novel cancer gene products.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To characterize the biological processes in which the candidate cancer genes predicted by
the combined model are likely to be involved, we identified binary interactions linking them
to each other or to Cancer Census proteins in the twelve ‘pathways of cancer’ relevant to
cancer development and progression (Table S5D) (Vogelstein et al., 2013). Of our top 100
candidates, 60 mapped to at least one cancer pathway (Figure 7F and Figure S7), twice as
many as would be expected from predictions using either the guilt-by-profiling or guilt-byassociation approach alone. We propose that many novel cancer candidates can be annotated
to specific processes based on their interactions with Cancer Census gene products and
known participation in cellular pathways. For example, the candidate protein ID3, a DNAbinding inhibitor, interacts with the two Cancer Census transcription factors TCF12 and
TCF3, suggesting a role for ID3 in the regulation of transcription by inhibiting binding of
specific transcription factors to DNA (Loveys et al., 1996; Richter et al., 2012). CTBP2,
which we identified as a potential suppressor in lymphoid tumors, represents another
example (Figure 5E and Figure S7).
In summary, the increased and uniform coverage of HI-II-14 demonstrates that known and
candidate cancer gene products are highly connected in the interactome network, which in
turn provides unbiased evidence for an expanded functional cancer landscape.

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

By systematically screening half of the interactome space with minimal inspection bias, we
more than doubled the number of high-quality binary PPIs available from the literature.
Covering zones of the human interactome landscape that have been weakly charted by other
approaches, our systematic binary map provides deeper functional context to thousands of
proteins, as demonstrated for candidates identified in unbiased cancer genomic screens.
Systematic binary mapping therefore stands as a powerful approach to “connect the dots” of
the genomic revolution.
Combining high-quality binary pairs from the literature with systematic binary maps, 30,000
high-confidence interactions are now available. It is likely that a large proportion of the
human interactome can soon be mapped by taking advantage of the emergence of reference
proteome maps (Kim et al., 2014; Wilhelm et al., 2014), a combination of nearly complete
clone collections (Yang et al., 2011), rapid improvements in Y2H assay sensitivity and
emerging interaction-mapping technologies that drastically reduce cost (Caufield et al.,
2012; Stagljar and Fields, 2002; Yu et al., 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Reference binary interactome maps of increased coverage and quality will be required to
interpret condition-specific interactions and to characterize the effects of splicing and
genetic variation on interactions (Zhong et al., 2009). While protein-protein interactions
represent an important class of interactions between macromolecules, future efforts
integrating this information with protein-DNA, protein-RNA, RNA-RNA or proteinmetabolite interactions will provide a unified view of the molecular interactions governing
cell behaviour. Just as a reference genome enabled detailed maps of human genetic variation
(1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012), completion of a reference interactome network
map will enable deeper insight into genotype-phenotype relationships in human.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Extraction of the literature-based datasets

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Human PPIs annotated with tractable publication records were extracted from seven
databases through August 2013. Large-scale systematic datasets and pairs involving
products of UBC, SUMO1, SUMO2, SUMO3, SUMO4 or NEDD8, were excluded. The
remaining pairs were divided into those having no piece of binary evidence (Lit-NB) and
those with at least one piece of binary evidence based on PSI-MI experimental method
codes. Binary ones were divided between pairs with one and two or more pieces of evidence
(Lit-BS and Lit-BM, respectively). For benchmark experiments in Y2H and MAPPIT,
equivalent datasets were extracted similarly in December 2010.
Generation of the binary protein-protein interaction map
HI-II-14 was generated by screening all pairwise combinations of 15,517 ORFs from
hORFeome v5.1 (Space II) as described previously (Dreze et al., 2010). ORFs encoding first
pass pairs were identified either by Sanger or by Stitch-seq (Yu et al., 2011). HI-II-14 was
validated by comparing a subset of 809 interactions to a positive and a random reference set
of 460 and 698 protein pairs, respectively, using MAPPIT, PCA and wNAPPA assays.

Interaction perturbation by disease and common variants

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Disease variants were obtained from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD 2009 V2)
(Stenson et al., 2014) and common variants were derived from the 1,000 genomes project
(1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012). Only variants with a minor allele frequency
above 1% were considered common. All successfully cloned disease and common variants
were systematically tested for interaction with all interactors of their wild-type counterpart.
Interaction density imbalance
For each protein property, we ranked all proteins and, for any property threshold, partitioned
the interactome space into a first region containing pairs of proteins both above (or below)
the threshold, and a second region containing all remaining pairs. Interaction density
imbalance of a given PPI map for a given threshold was calculated as the fraction of
interactions observed in the first region minus the fraction of PPIs expected assuming a
uniform distribution in the space. Dense and sparse zones were defined by identifying the
threshold for which the deviation from expectation is maximal.
Measure of functional enrichment

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For each pairwise comparison, PPI and functional maps were trimmed to interactions where
both proteins were present in both maps and restricted to Space II to allow comparison
between PPI maps. Functional enrichment odds ratios were calculated using Fisher’s exact
tests.
GWAS analysis
307 distinct cancer-associated SNPs were identified from 75 GWAS publications covering
10 types of cancer and 142 distinct loci were identified at a linkage disequilibrium threshold
of 0.9. For each map, we calculated the number of loci encoding an interactor of a Cancer
Census protein over the number of loci encoding a protein in the PPI map. To assess
significance, we measured the corresponding fraction when randomly selecting for each
locus the same number of proteins than genes with products in the PPI map.
Cancer association scoring system

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For each gene, 7 features were measured. Three features represent membership in the SB,
SM and VT lists of candidate cancer genes (“guilt-by-profiling” features). The four other
features represent its number of interactors in HI-II-14 that are present in these three lists
and in the Cancer Census list, normalized by the expected numbers in degree-controlled
randomized networks (“guilt-by-association” features). We measured the ability of each
feature to prioritize known Cancer Census genes with separate logistic regression models.
We combined all seven features in a forward stepwise logistic regression model using the
Akaike information criterion to determine the stepwise halting. The final set of features
selected was: the SB, SM and VT guilt-by-profiling and the Cancer Census and SB guilt-byassociation features. “Receiver Operating Characteristic” curves were obtained by
measuring at decreasing score threshold the fraction of known Cancer Census genes
recovered and the corresponding fraction of proteins predicted as candidate cancer genes.
