ABSTRACT
Signaling transducer and activator 3 (STAT3) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) have
garnered huge attention as a therapeutic focus, based on evidence that they may
represent an etiologic root of tumor initiation and radio-chemoresistance. Here, we
investigated the high phosphorylation status of STAT3 (p-STAT3) and its correlation
with self-renewal markers in head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Overexpression of p-STAT3 was found to have increased in post chemotherapy HNSCC
tissue. We showed that blockade of p-STAT3 eliminated both bulk tumor and side
population (SP) cells with characteristics of CSCs in vitro. Inhibition of p-STAT3 using
small molecule S3I-201 significantly delayed tumorigenesis of spontaneous HNSCC
in mice. Combining blockade of p-STAT3 with cytotoxic drugs cisplatin, docetaxel,
5-fluorouracil (TPF) enhanced the antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo with decreased
tumor sphere formation and SP cells. Taken together, our results advocate blockade of
p-STAT3 in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs enhance efficacy
by improving CSCs eradication in HNSCC.

Accumulating evidence reveals that many types of
tumors including HNSCC are frequently composed of
heterogeneous cell types and that tumor initiation, growth,
metastasis, chemoresistance, and recurrence after therapy
are driven by a subpopulation of cells, termed cancer
stem cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells [3]. CSCs share
certain properties with normal stem and/or progenitor
cells, while it have accumulated oncogenic mutations
and lost normal constraints on growth control. Recent
studies have suggested that CSCs play a pivotal role in the
development and progression of HNSCC [4]. Accumulated
evidence indicated that CSCs, which have not been
completely destroyed in conventional chemotherapy, can
cause relapse of cancer and regrowth of the tumor [5].
Therefore, the improvement of therapies targeting CSCs
may raise hope for the treatment of HNSCC patient. All
told, it is essential to develop the corresponding treatment
targeting CSCs to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Recent study reported the

INTRODUCTION
Head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
which has more than 600,000 newly diagnosed cases per
year and a high mortality rate, is the sixth most common
cancer worldwide [1]. Despite significant advances
in therapeutic approaches including reconstructive
surgery, minimally invasive surgery, precisely targeted
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and monoclonal antibody
therapy that have been achieved in the last three decades,
little improvement has been achieved in the overall
survival rates for HNSCC patients [2]. The mortality of
HNSCC is mainly caused by the emergence of therapyresistant local recurrence and local metastasis to cervical
lymph node, and occasionally by metastasis in distant
organs [2]. Thus, an urgent better understanding of
HNSCC tumorigenesis and more efficacy therapeutic
target (oncotarget) are needed for improving clinical
outcome of this fatal disease.

existence of the side population (SP) cells, which are often
used for the identification and isolation of cancer stemlike cells [6]. In addition, previous study identified CD44+
[7] and ALDH1+ [8] cell population as possible molecular
biomarkers of cancer stemloid cells in HNSCC patient.
As a point of convergence for many oncogenic
signaling pathways, STAT3 is persistently activated in
HNSCC by abnormal signaling of various growth factor
receptors [9]. Phosphorylated STAT3 monomers dimerize
and translocate to the nucleus [10] to induce transcription
of genes involving in cell survival, proliferation,
angiogenesis and metastasis in HNSCC, and STAT3
has been proposed as a therapeutic oncotarget [11]. In
addition, STAT3 has been validated to affect cancer cell
sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic agents
such as cisplatin (CDDP), [12], paclitaxel [13], imatinib
[14], gefitinib [15] and erlotinib [16]. However, the
effect of STAT3 inhibition alone or in combination with
conventional chemotherapeutic agents on drug-resistant
CSCs has still not been well investigated in HNSCC.
In this study, correlation between p-STAT3 and selfrenewal markers was explored in human HNSCC. The
efficacies of selective STAT3 inhibitor in chemotherapyenriched HNSCC cancer stemloid cell population were
explored in vitro and in vivo.

S2B) as well as in node positive original HNSCC (N1+N2
verse N0, P < 0.05, Supplementary Figure S2C), while
there was no significant difference between Grade III and
Grade II, and no significant difference between Grade II and
Grade I. We further investigated the correlation of p-STAT3
with CSCs markers based on previous reports that STAT3
plays crucial roles in the regulation of cancer stem cells.
We examined the expression of CSCs self-renewal related
markers ALDH1, CD44, OCT4 and SOX2. Interestingly, all
these self-renewal markers showed high expression levels in
HNSCC tissue as compared with normal mucosa (Figure 1C).
The expression of p-STAT3 significantly correlated with
CSCs markers OCT4 (r = 0.4209, Supplementary Figure
S2D), SOX2 (r = 0.4310, Supplementary Figure S2E),
ALDH1 (r = 0.3396, Supplementary Figure S2F), and CD44
(r = 0.3961, Supplementary Figure S2G). Besides, to better
visualize the correlation of p-STAT3 and CSCs markers,
we conducted hierarchical cluster analysis (Figure 1D).
Together, these results suggest over-expression of p-STAT3
and the close correlation between p-STAT3 with CSCs selfrenewal markers were universal phenomenon in HNSCC,
which indicates that p-STAT3 has potential roles in CSCs
regulation.

Blockade of p-STAT3 attenuates cell viability
and CSCs phenotype of HNSCC in vitro

RESULTS

To determine whether STAT3 pathway activity is
required for the survival or self-renew of tumor cells, we
used S3I-201, a novel inhibitor of STAT3 by blocking
dimerization [10] for in vitro functional experiment.
We started to examine the expression of p-STAT3 in
HNSCC cell lines FaDu, SCC4, SCC9, UMSCC23,
CAL27, SCC15 and SCC25 as compared with normal
oral squamous epithelia keratinocyte (OKC). As shown in
Figure 2A, high level p-STAT3 expression was detected in
all HNSCC cell lines with even stronger level in CAL27
and FaDu as compared with control. We also examined
the protein level of four self-renewal transcription factors:
SOX2, CD44, ALDH1 and OCT4 (Supplementary Figure
S3H) and got similar result with p-STAT3, and there is no
change of the STAT3 protein level. Therefore, we selected
CAL27 and FaDu cell lines with high phosphorylation
of STAT3 for the following in vitro functional assay.
We analyzed the cell viability of CAL27 using CCK8
kit in indicated concentrations of S3I-201. As shown in
Figure  2B, S3I-201 inhibited CAL27 cell growth with
IC50 of 99.3 uM. We confirmed this inhibition of cell
viability by on target effect as indicated by decrease of
p-STAT3 with S3I-201 by immunofluorescence using
confocal scope (Figure 2C). To further confirm whether
the inhibition of cell growth by S3I-201 was through
apoptotic cell death, we performed flow cytometry. As
shown in Figure 2D, STAT3 blockade could significantly
increase the Annxin V+PI+ and Annxin V+PI− cell
population in a dose dependent manner after 24 h S3I-201

Activation of STAT3 in human HNSCC is
associated with cancer stem cells
Previous reports have shown that activation of
STAT3 signaling was due to gene mutation and high level
phosphorylation were widely expressed in HNSCC [17,
18], while the exact role of STAT3 in HNSCC CSCs is
unclear. To determine whether STAT3 pathway expression
was associated with human HNSCC, we interrogated the
Oncomine database [19] to explore the gene expression of
STAT3 in head neck cancer. Strikingly, the high alternation
expression STAT3 is significantly increased in 17/18 HNSCC
datasets (Supplementary Figure S1A). Meta-analysis suggest
significant increase of STAT3 using 7 dataset (P = 0.001,
Figure 1A). Data retrieved from Tissue Cancer Genome Atlas
head neck cancer dataset [20] suggest DNA copy number of
STAT3 significant increase in human HNSCC as compared
with control counterpart (P = 7.69E-4, Supplementary
Figure S1B). Dataset from another 3 independent datasets
confirms mRNA level of different location of head neck
cancer is significantly higher as compared with oral mucosa
(Supplementary Figures S1C–S1E). We started to examine
the phosphorylation Status of STAT3 in tyrosine 705 residue.
As expected, p-STAT3 was highly expressed in HNSCC
(n = 43) as compared with normal oral mucosa samples
(n = 16, P < 0.001, Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S2A)
and there was significantly increased in high grade HNSCC
(Grade III verse Grade I, P < 0.05, Supplementary Figure

treatment. This result was also confirmed in other in­
dicated time point (Supplementary Figures S3A and
S3B) and was repeatable in another HNSCC cell line
FaDu (Supplementary Figures S3C and S3D). To verify
the effect of S3I-201 on self-renewal ability, we found
that HNSCC CAL27 cells formed tumor-spheres was
directly proportional to the number of cells seeded. As
shown in Figure 2E, STAT3 blockade with S3I-201 could
significantly reduce the size and number of tumor spheres
which indicating the self-renewal or initiation ability
when compared with control (Figure 2E). To further
confirm the effect of STAT3 blockage, we examined the
self-renewal markers by Western blotting (Figure 2F).
As expected, S3I-201 could decrease the protein level
of Cyclin D1 and Bcl-2, which are known as a putative
downstream target of STAT3. Additionally, inhibition of
STAT3 may decrease self-renewal marker Nanog, OCT4,
ALDH1 and CD44. This result was also validated in
another HNSCC cell line FaDu (Supplementary Figures
S3E–S3G). The above results suggest that STAT3
blockade could not only decrease non-CSC cancer cells
but also reduce CSCs through self-renewal transcription
factors, indicating STAT3 blockade can truly inhibit CSCs
phenotype with small molecule inhibitor S3I-201.

treatment. Taken together, these observations showed STAT3
blockade decreased tumor growth may through targeting
apoptosis and CSCs phenotype in HNSCC xenograft mouse
model.

Blockade of p-STAT3 decreases CSCs phenotype
in de novo spontaneous mice HNSCC
To further determine the potential role of STAT3
pathway in tumor initiation effect, we take advantage
of spontaneous de novo HNSCC mice models for our
tumorigenesis studies. Combined epithelial knock out of
Tgfbr1 and Pten mice will full penetrated develop head
neck and oral squamous cell carcinoma in a short period
window (3–6 weeks after tamoxifen induction) [21]. Tgfbr1/
Pten 2cKO mice were baseline induced with tamoxifen 2
mg for five consequently days to delete Tgfbr1 and Pten.
5 mg/kg S3I-201 and control (100 μl PBS) were given i.p.
every other day (q.o.d.) for 15 consecutive days (Figure
4A) for a chemotherapeutic experiment. Remarkably, S3I201 treatment (n = 6) significant reduced head neck tumor
(Figure 4B) and tongue tumor (Figure 4C) formation 14
days after infusion as compared with control group (n = 6,
Figure 4D) without additional toxicity (Figure 4E). To
further confirm the reduction of tumor was correlated with
cancer stem cells, we used immunohistochemical staining to
detect the p-STAT3 as well as CSCs markers OCT4, SOX2
and ALDH1. Similar to prior experiments OCT4, SOX2 and
ALDH1 were consistently decreased after S3I-201 treatment
when compared with control group (Supplementary Figure
S5A and quantification in Supplementary Figure S5B). In
addition, to further investigate the delay of tumor volume,
we induced our mice model by tamoxifen administration
and 14 days later we initiated treated with 5 mg/kg S3I201 and control (100 μl PBS) were given i.p. every other
day (q.o.d.) for 28 consecutive days (Supplementary Figure
S6A) for chemopreventive experiment. Tumor volume
was calculated once a week. S3I-201 treatment (n = 6)
significant delayed head neck tumor (Supplementary Figure
S6B) formation 6 weeks after intraperitoneal injection as
compared with control group (n = 6, Supplementary Figure
S6C) without additional toxicity (data not shown). Overall,
these findings revealed that STAT3 blockade could delay
tumor initiation and progression in de novo spontaneous
mice model through reducing cancer stem cells.

Blockage of p-STAT3 reduces CSCs phenotype
in xenograft mouse model of HNSCC
To evaluate the activity and tolerability of S3I-201
in HNSCC in vivo, we took advantage of human HNSCC
CAL27 xenograft model. 106 cells/mouse CAL27 cells
were implanted subcutaneous into the flank of nude mice,
and treatment was initiated beginning 14 days after tumor
inoculation. As shown in schematic diagram Figure 3A,
S3I-201 (5 mg/kg) or control (100 μl PBS) was given
intraperitoneal (i.p.) every other day (q.o.d) for 14 consecutive
days. Tumor volume and body weight were calculated every
other day with electronic caliper and balance. As shown in
Figure 3B and 3C, tumor volume had a remarkable reduction
14 days after S3I-201 treatment when compared with control
group (Figure 3D and 3E). We evaluated the toxicity of this
dosage with body weight changes. The result showed there
was no significant additional toxicity of S3I-201 group as
indicated by weight reduction as compared with control
(Figure 3F, P > 0.05). To further confirm the decrease in
tumor volume was directly correlated with CSCs blockade,
tumor excised from xenograft mice were used to validated the
correlation by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.
We compared the molecular expression of p-STAT3 in S3I201 and control group. The data suggested that indeed S3I201 could decrease p-STAT3 and its target gene Cyclin D1
and Bcl2 effectively in vivo, which indicate the decrease
of tumor size of nude mice using S3I-201 is an on-target
effect. CSCs marker ALDH1 and regulator OCT4, SOX2
were found reduced by Western blotting (Figure 3G) and
by immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Figure S4A and

our proposal. We found significant increased p-STAT3
expression level in post-TPF chemotherapy HNSCC as
compared with biopsy specimen (Figures 5A and 5B). We
analyzed the cell viability of CAL27 using CCK8 kit in
indicated concentrations of TPF (Supplementary Figures
S7A, S7B and S7C). We used CCK8 assay to analyze the
cell viability after DTX treated by different concentrations
of p-STAT3 inhibitor (Supplementary Figure S7D) and
we confirmed this combination concentration of p-STAT3
inhibitor with TPF by Western blotting (Supplementary
Figures S7E). Additionally, we found that phosphorylation
of STAT3 was still high expressed in single chemoreagent especially in DTX treated CAL27 cell line
(Figure 5C), which suggest that activated STAT3 pathway
may correlate with chemoresistance. To determine
the combination effect of STAT3 inhibition with TPF
regents, we used flow cytometry to detect the apoptosis of
combined S3I-201 treatment. As expected combined S3I201 treatment increased Annexin V+PI+ and Annexin V+PI−
CAL27 cell population (Figures 5D and 5E). To further
confirm STAT3 inhibition may effect on tumor cell selfrenewal ability, in vitro tumor-sphere formation assay was
assessed for chemotherapeutical agents or in combination
with S3I-201. As expected, S3I-201 combined with
chemotherapeutical agents could decreased not only the
size of tumor spheres but also the number of tumor spheres
no matter the different size profile (Figures 5F and 5G).
Consistent with our aforementioned experiments, S3I-201
combination with chemotherapeutical agents significantly
decreased side population cells, which efflux the Hoechst
dye via the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins expressed within the cell membrane,
enriched by CDDP, DTX and 5–FU (Figures 6A and 6B).
We then used CD44+ positive cells to further analyze the
effects of STAT3 signaling in CSCs in vitro (Figures 6C
and 6D). Collectively, combination of STAT3 inhibition
may reduce classical TPF chemo-reagents enriched CSCs
population in vitro.
To further determine whether the STAT3 inhibition
reduces chemo-reagents enriched CSC in vivo, we
used a xenograft mice model. We started single reagent
chemotherapy of DTX, CDDP and 5-FU respectively with
or without S3I-201 treatment 14 days after inoculation.
A schematic in vivo drug delivery strategy was described
in Figure 7A according to literature [25] and modified from
inductive TPF chemotherapy protocol of human HNSCC
patient [26]. For chemotherapeutic reagent treatment 10
mg/kg CDDP or DTX were infused at day 14, while 15
mg/kg 5-FU was infused every day from day14 to day 19.
The S3I-201 only group tumor bearing mice receive 5 mg/
kg S3I-201 every other day and combined group receive
additional 5 mg/kg S3I-201 every other day from day 20
to day 26 (n = 5 mice respectively). As shown in Figure
7A and 7B, the S3I-201 only group are quite consistent
with previous experiment with slightly significant (P <
0.05) reduction of tumor volume as compared with control
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(PBS) group. While, combinatorial chemotherapy with
S3I-201 may act synergistically to reduce tumor growth
as compared with single reagent groups (P < 0.001 in
CDDP, DTX and 5-FU group respectively). To confirm
the reductions of tumor growth is on-target effect of CSCs,
we harvested the xenograft from mice and analyzed with
flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 7C, combined S3I201 treatment significantly reduced TPF-regents enriched
CD44+ cell population. Quantification of CD44+ was shown
in Figure  7D. Briefly, we confirm combinational STAT3
inhibition by S3I-201 may significantly reduce tumor growth
by reducing HNSCC CSCs population in vitro and in vivo.

DISCUSSION
CSCs or cancer stem-like cells has been thought to
be responsible for the relapse and metastasis of cancer [27]
and has been regarded as a novel target for cancer therapy
[8]. On the basis of the increased expression of p-STAT3
in human HNSCC, which is consistent with previously
study, we hypothesized that STAT3 may play an important
role in maintaining HNSCC cancer stem cell properties.
Indeed, we found that p-STAT3 expression is critical for
maintaining stemloid cancer cell properties [27], including
tumor initiation and resistance to chemotherapeutics in
HNSCC. Furthermore, we observed STAT3 blockade
delayed the de novo tumorigenesis of mice HNSCC by
reducing of stemloid cancer cell. The role of STAT3 in
HNSCC is also highlighted by increased tumoricidal effect
of STAT3 inhibitor and reduction of enriched CSCs in
combined with CDDP, DTX and 5-FU chemotherapy.
As a point of convergence for many oncogenic
signaling pathways, STAT3 plays an important roles
in angiogenesis, immune regulation and maintains
stemloid cancer cell by crosstalk with driver mutation
events of HNSCC e.g. Notch1, P53, NF-κB and EGFR
(see review [28]). Indeed, The identification of CSCs
and their roles has altered our understanding of cancer
biology and caused a reevaluation of current therapies
in HNSCC [3]. Although it’s rather clear that STAT3
signaling play a crucial role in tumor initiation [29, 30],
viability, angiogenesis and metastasis [28, 30–32], the
function of STAT3 signaling in HNSCC CSCs is still an
open question. Consistent with Grandis and colleagues
[31], the present study also demonstrated that blockade
of STAT3 can significantly induced cell death in HNSCC
cell lines and obviously decreased tumor volumes in
xenograft mice model. More interestingly, reduced tumor
growth by STAT3 signaling blockade was coupled with
remarkable inhibition of cancer stem cells implicated by
tumor sphere and CSCs self-renewal markers. Indeed,
the de novo spontaneous HNSCC mice chemopreventive
study showed more significant reduction of tumor growth
when compared with the late stage chemotherapeutic
experiment, which indicated early inhibition of both CSCs
and bulk tumor cells with p-STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201

may be responsible for the increased effectiveness. This
significant inhibition of tumorigenesis in early stage of
STAT3 inhibition may be due to significant activation of
mTOR in the early stage of tumorigenesis of Tgfbr1/Pten
2cKO mice [21] and positive feed forward loop of mTOR/
STAT3 [33]. Also, it indicated that the debulking effect
of STAT3 inhibition in mice HNSCC model was rather a
comprehensive effect on CSCs, proliferation, angiogenesis
[34] and tumor infiltrating immune cells [28]. Recent
reports indicated that angiogenic genes are important
characteristic molecular signature of HNSCC CSCs [35]
and immune cells [36] such as immature myeloid cells
which play an important role in maintaining cancer cell

stemness. All above, our results revealed that blockade
of STAT3 could target both non-CSCs to decrease tumor
growth and CSCs to generate powerful treatment in the
early stage of tumor.
Moreover, the existence of CSCs is the central
contributing factor to hinder successful cancer chemotherapy
[37]. We speculated that targeting STAT3 pathway may
be an effective therapeutic strategy for HNSCC with
chemotherapeutic enriched CSC properties. Recent study
report that, the proportion of the CD44+/CD24− CSCs
were significantly increased in the specimens treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with paired breast
cancer biopsy specimens without chemotherapy [38].

expression level of p-STAT3 in post-TPF chemotherapy was
significantly higher than original HNSCC. Indeed, cytotoxic
reagent CDDP not only enrich HNSCC CSCs by debulking
proliferating cancer cell but also increase the fraction of stem
cell by inducing putative self-renewal marker Bmi1 [39] and
associated with STAT3 activation [40]. The most common
sign of multidrug-resistance is the increased drug efflux from
cancer cells by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters,
which was highly expressed in CSCs and was used to identify
and isolate side population cells [41, 42]. In our study, we
found TPF chemotherapy could significantly enriched the SP
cells, which were eliminated by the combination of p-STAT3
inhibitor S3I-201 with TPF in vitro. We demonstrated that
S3I-201 could significantly enhance the conventional
chemotherapeutic agents by eradicating CSCs. Recent report
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

indicate STAT3 play a pivotal role in IL6/STAT3/Jagged-1/
Notch feedback loop in chemoresistance [43]. As mentioned
above, STAT3 signaling has been linked to chemoresistance
of CSCs, suggesting that inhibition of STAT3 signaling
may not only disrupt the maintenance of CSCs [44] but also
reduce the chemoresistance of CSCs triggered by CDDP,
DTX, and 5-FU.
Knowledge of STAT3 signaling pathway allows
numerous pharmaceutical development strategies
to suppress STAT3 activation such as (a) inhibiting
the receptor ligand complexes; (b) blocking the
kinases that phosphorylate the cytoplasmic tail of the
receptor; (c) inducing the activity of the phosphatases
that dephosphorylate STAT3; (d) inhibiting JAK
kinases thereby stopping STAT3 dimerization; (e)
preventing nuclear translocation of STAT3; (f) blocking

STAT3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity; (g)
application of STAT3 anti-sense strategies and (h) decoy
oligodeoxynucleotides [45]. Although, transcription
factors such as STAT3 have traditionally been deemed
“undruggable”, there are small molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitors that have been designed to inhibit the STAT3
pathway including AG490 and AZD1480, and several
of these agents are being studied in clinical trial setting
[46]. STAT3 decoy oligonucleotide binds specifically to
deactivate STAT3 and blocks binding of STAT3 to DNA
sequences on STAT3-responsive promoters, resulting in
inhibition of STAT3-mediated transcriptions [47], but
unlucky, this preclinical trials utilizing STAT3 inhibitors
had to date been disappointing. S3I-201 is a new discover
small molecule of inhibiting STAT3 dimerization and
thereby prevent nuclear translocation of STAT3 [10], and
so far there is no clinical trial on this molecule. In our
study, S3I-201 could significantly reduce tumor cells in
vitro and attenuate tumor burden in vivo without additional
side effect through an on target effect by decreasing
the level of p-STAT3. It is well known that p-STAT3 is
required in early development and STAT3-null mice suffer
embryonic-lethal and non-tumor cells can survive in vitro
and in vivo by specific knocking out stat3 [48]. In our in
vivo study, S3I-201 didn’t reduce tumor-bearing mice body
weight. However, as a ubiquitous transcription factor,
more relatively experiments deserved to do to verify its
potential toxicity. Recent advancements in nanomedicine
[49] might be a potential strategy in reducing possible
toxicities by allowing tumor-specific delivery of S3I-201
and even reduced the drug dose of S3I-201.
Collectively, the current study, we showed that S3I201 delayed tumorigenesis of mice HNSCC and enhanced
the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic agents by
eradicating CSCs in HNSCC. While, keep in mind that
the promising preclinical data was not guarantee to have
good efficacy in human as STAT3 decoy treatment in mice
[47] and human [17] HNSCC. Our study suggests that
treatment with STAT3 signaling antagonists alone or in
combination with the conventional chemotherapy agents
may offer improved treatment for HNSCC and warrant
future clinical trial.

according to published protocols [21, 50]. All animal
studies were carried out in compliance with the NIH
guidelines for the use of laboratory animals in specific
pathogen free (SPF) Animal Laboratory of Wuhan
University School & Hospital of Stomatology as
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
Wuhan University. The details of Tgfbr1 cKO HNSCC
mice (K14-CreERtam+/−; Tgfbr1flox/flox), Pten cKO HNSCC
mice (K14-CreERtam+/−; Ptenflox/flox) were previously
described [21, 50]. All the mice were maintained in
FVBN/CD1/129/C57 mixed background.

S3I-201 treatment
S3I-201 (NSC74859) was purchased from Selleck
Chemicals (Westlake Village, CA) and dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide for use at indicated concentrations.
For nude mice xenograft chemotherapeutic experiment, a
flask of Human HNSCC cell line CAL27 were injected
subcutaneously in nude mice. Two weeks after injection,
the tumor was visible. The mice were randomly divides
into control group (PBS, i.p. q.o.d, n = 6 mice) and 5 mg/
kg S3I-201 treated group (i.p. daily, n = 6 mice) were
performed with 14 days observation. For combined S3I201 and chemotherapy reagent experiment, 10 mg/kg
CDDP or DTX were infused at day 14, while 15 mg/kg
5-FU was infused every day from day14 to day 19. The
S3I-201 only group tumor bearing mice receive 5 mg/
kg S3I-201 every other day and combined group receive
additional 5 mg/kg S3I-201 every other day from day 20
to day 26 (n = 5 mice respectively).
For chemotherapeutic transgenic mouse HNSCC
tumorigenesis experiment, 4- weeks after the last dose
of oral gavage of tamoxifen for 5 consequent days,
the Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mice were randomly divided
into experiment group receive 5 mg/kg S3I-201
intraperitoneal injection every other day (i.p. q.o.d, n =
6 mice) or control group (PBS, i.p. q.o.d, n = 6 mice).
Mice were treated with this dosing schedule of S3I201 for 25 days, and tumor size was measured every 5
days. For chemopreventive transgenic mice HNSCC
tumorigenesis experiment, 1- week after the last dose
of gavage tamoxifen, the Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mice were
randomly divided into experiment group receive 5 mg/
kg S3I-201 intraperitoneal injection every other day (i.p.
q.o.d, n = 6 mice) or control group (PBS, i.p. q.o.d, n = 6
mice). S3I-201 and PBS treatment were performed at day
14 and maintain for 4 weeks. For all animal experiment
tumor size was measured with a micrometer caliper
and photographed every other day. The endpoint was
determined according to a systematic evaluation by the
veterinary doctor. The mice were euthanized using CO2
at the end of the studies, and the tumors were fixed in
paraffin overnight or frozen at –80°C for the following
immunohistochemical analysis.

Cell culture, cell proliferation assay and Annexin
V/PI staining

These tissue microarray slides included 43 confirmed
cases of HNSCC, 16 normal oral mucosa and 6 oral
epithelial dysplasia, 12 patients with biopsy and post-TPF
chemotherapy specimen. The 12 HNSCC patients receive
2 round combined CDDP, DTX, and 5-FU therapy with
the same protocol of Zhang’s clinical trial [26]. Patient
samples with both biopsy as well as surgical specimen
after 2 rounds were involved in these custom-made tissue
microarrays.

HNSCC cell lines CAL27, FaDu, SCC4, SCC9,
SCC15, SCC25, UM-SCC23 were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA). 2–3 passive primary cultured oral keratinocyte
cell line (OKC) was used for a normal control. Cell
proliferation was accessed by Cell Counting Kit
(CCK8, Dojindo Laboratories, Japan) assay. Annexin
V/PI (BD Pharmingen. San Diego, CA) staining was
performed according to manufacturer’s instruction and
cell counted by flow cytometry (BD Pharmingen. San
Diego, CA) [51].

Scoring system, hierarchical clustering, data
visualization and statistical analysis
As we previously described [54], the hiotoscore
of each slice was calculated as a percentage of different
positive cells using the formula (3+) × 3+(2+) × 2+(1+)
× 1, cluster program with average linkage based on
Pearson’s correlation, and data visualization were done
using the Tree View program. Statistical data analysis
was performed with GraphPad Prism 5.03 (GraphPad
Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The differences in
immunostaining and protein levels among each group
were analyzed by the One-way ANOVA followed by the
post-Tukey or Bonferroni multiple comparison tests. The
Mann–Whitney U test was used to evaluate differences in
the total tumor area of the mice treated with S3I-201 and
control group. Two-tailed Pearson Statistics were used for
correlated expression of these markers after confirmation
of the sample with Gaussian distribution. Statistical
significance was defined as the p-value was < 0.05.

Sphere formation assay and side population
assay
Tumor sphere culture assay were carried out as
previously described [51]. Side population discrimination
was based on Goodell and colleagues [52] with slight
attention according to the recommendation of Boesch
and colleagues [53]. Briefly, cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) were
resuspended in pre-warmed DMEM (Life Technologies)
with 2% FBS (Life Technologies) containing freshly added
Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/mL final concentration) for 90 minutes
at 37°C in water bath with intermittent mixing and darkness,
either alone or in the presence of 50 μmol/L verapamil
(Sigma). At the end of incubation, samples were chilled on
ice, centrifuged down at 4°C and resuspended in ice-cold
PBS with 2% FBS (Life Technologies). 7-AAD at a final
concentration of 2 μg/mL was added for 5 minutes before
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, which
allows for the discrimination of dead versus live cells. To
dissociate multicellular aggregates, the cells were filtered
with 40-μm cell strainer. The Hoechst33342 dye was
excited with the UV laser at 355 nm and its fluorescence
was dual-wavelength analyzed (blue, 450/65 nm; red,
670/30 nm) with FACSVantage SE (Becton Dickinson).
