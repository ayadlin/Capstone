Abstract
Integrin α4β1 is an attractive but poorly understood target for selective diagnosis and treatment of
T-cell and B-cell lymphomas. This report focuses on the rapid microwave preparation, structure-activity
relationships, and biological evaluation of medicinally pertinent benzimidazole heterocycles as integrin
α4β1 antagonists. We documented tumor uptake of derivatives labeled with 125I in xenograft murine models of B-cell lymphoma. Molecular homology models of integrin α4β1 predicted that docked halobenzimidazole carboxamides have the halogen atom in a suitable orientation for halogen-hydrogen bonding. The
high-affinity halogenated ligands identified offer attractive tools for medicinal and biological use,
including fluoro and iodo derivatives with potential radiodiagnostic (18F) or radiotherapeutic (131I) applications, or chloro and bromo analogues that could provide structural insights into integrin-ligand interactions
through photoaffinity, cross-linking/mass spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallographic studies. Cancer Res; 70(13);

Introduction
Current cancer chemotherapeutic agents aim to annihilate
tumors through mechanisms such as DNA alkylation, unnatural base pair recognition, inhibition of topoisomerases,
and microtubule stabilization mechanisms. However, these
agents have a narrow therapeutic index, are administered
near their maximum tolerated dose, and are largely nondiscriminatory in recognizing either normal or cancerous cells.
As a consequence, patients suffer from serious side effects
including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy,

nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, anemia, and various organ toxicities. Although significant effort has been directed
through lengthy syntheses of complex cytotoxic natural products, not until recently has attention been focused towards
target-selective chemotherapeutics that could reduce off-target binding and ensuing side effects (1).
The resting or activated conformations of α4β1 integrin
allow for the application of target-selective agents for malignant lymphoid cancers; activated α4β1 integrin is expressed
on leukemias, lymphomas, melanomas, and sarcomas (2, 3).
Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptor proteins crucial for cell-cell, cell-matrix, and cell-pathogen interactions (4). Integrin α 4β1 plays an important role in
autoimmune diseases and inflammation (5), as well as tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis (6–11). Indeed,
α4β1 integrin facilitates tumor cell extravasation (6), prevents apoptosis of malignant B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (7), is key to drug resistance in both multiple
myeloma and acute myelogenous leukemia (8), and has been
selectively targeted with peptidomimetics (3, 12–16). Nonetheless, α4β1 integrin has not garnered much attention as
either a therapeutic or a diagnostic cancer target due to
the lack of potent and specific agents.
In accord with our program to discover potent and selective ligands that target various cancers, we have developed two in vivo imaging agents that have been successful
in murine models (3, 12–17). Figure 1A and B show the
structure of these agents; the bisaryl urea 1-Cy5.5 (LLP2ACy5.5; Fig. 1A; refs. 3, 14) and the benzothiazole analogue
2-Cy5.5 (KLCA14-Cy5.5; Fig. 1B; ref. 15), both showed high
affinity and specificity for B- and T-cell lymphomas containing activated α4β1 integrin, with the latter showing improved tumor/kidney signal. This is likely due to the

improved solubility of 2-arylamino azole heterocycle (13, 15)
over the bisaryl urea as these heterocycles have a lower log
P, a higher dipole moment, and an increased acidity of the
2-arylamino N–H (pK a = 5.5–6.5; ref. 18). However, both
1-Cy5.5 and 2-Cy5.5 have approximately one third of the molecular weight committed to the α4β1 integrin-targeting motif
with the rest of the molecular weight devoted to the linker and
the dye. Furthermore, due to the limited range of tissue penetration, optical imaging is not practical for whole-body imaging in humans. There is a need to develop a condensed α4β1
integrin radiotargeting agent that could not only be used for
positron emission tomography and single-photon emission
computed tomography imaging but also for radiotherapy.
With efforts integrating heterocyclic chemistry, cell adhesion
assays, molecular modeling, and radiochemistry, we report
herein the discovery of the bromobenzimidazole carboxamide
5 (IC50 = 115 pmol/L), the structure-activity relationship between halobenzimidazole carboxamides 3 to 6, and the biological evaluation of radioiodinated derivates 7, 8, and 18
(structures shown in Fig. 1C and D).

Radioiodination of the compound bromobenzimazole
carboxamide 5 using Na125I was evaluated by a number
of methods and conditions but the following procedure
provided the most consistent and best yields. Briefly,
50 μL of a 2.5 mmol/L solution of compound 5 in 1
mol/L of sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) was added to 50
μL of a 5 mol/L solution of chloramine T in distilled water
and mixed in a vial containing 185 MBq of Na125I and 10
mol% of CuI at 50°C for 20 minutes. This mixture was
then quenched with 100 μL of 5 mmol/L sodium bisulfite
for about 15 minutes. Radiolabeled 7 was eluted through a
C18 spin column with 250 μL of 1:1 acetonitrile/water.
Radiolabeling yields were in the range of 20% to 25%, with
specific activities ranging from 25.4 to 38.0 MBq (0.8–1.2
μCi)/μmol (specific activity was calculated and corrected
after final purification). Quality assurance for compound
7 was estimated by reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) with
radioactive and UV detectors and the labeled peptide
showed a single peak of >95% purity. The final purified
products showed >95% monomeric compounds by C 18
TLC, RP-HPLC, and CAE runs of 11 and 45 minutes; the
unbound radioiodine was <5%.

A 2.5 mmol/L solution of compound 5 (200 μg, 50 μL) in
1 mol/L of sodium phosphate (adjusted to pH 7.0 with
H3PO4) was added to 50 μL of a 5 mmol/L solution of chloramine T in DMSO (200 μL) and mixed in a vial containing
Na125I (1 mCi, 10 μL), 10 mol% diethyldiamine and 10 mol
% ratio of CuI at 50°C for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes,
this mixture was quenched with 100 μL of a 5 mmol/L solution of NaHSO3 in H2O for 15 minutes. Crude radiolabeled 8 was eluted through a C-18 spin column with
250 μL of 1:1 acetonitrile/water to afford pure 8 in 90%

9 as determined by TLC, 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide
(451 μL, 2.90 mmol) was added, the tube was sealed, and
the reaction mixture was microwave-heated to 80°C for
11 minutes. After our previously described workup, this
crude ester was then dissolved in DMF (8 mL), transferred
to a sealable microwave tube, treated with Ba(OH)2 (1.65 g,
9.65 mmol), and microwave-heated to 140°C for 21 minutes.

Multiple sequence alignment and model building
The sequence alignment between α4β1 integrin and the
template (α IIb β 3 integrin; ref. 22; see Supplementary
Figs. S3–4) was performed using PSI-BLAST-ISS (23). Sequences having similarity to both α4β1 and αIIbβ3 integrins
were used as seeds to generate corresponding PSI-BLAST
profiles (24), which were extracted and compared. Protein
models were generated using MODELLER (25).
Docking simulations
Compounds were docked in the vicinity of Trp188 in (α4)
using Autodock (26). The partial atomic charges for the ligands were obtained using the AM1-BCC (27) method and
united atom charges were used for the integrin (28). An 80 ×
90 × 90 grid was used with a spacing of 0.375 Å and centered
above Trp188. A Lamarckian algorithm was used to generate
ligand conformations using previously reported parameters
whereas keeping the energy evaluations at a maximum of
150,000 (29). A total of 5,000 conformers were generated
for each ligand and clustered using a 2.0 Å root mean square
deviation.

The cell adhesion assay method is described elsewhere
(13, 15).

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
Both the azole carboxamide and bromoazole acetamide
series were previously known to be ineffective ligands for
α4β1 integrin. Indeed, previous structure-activity relationship
studies found that a methylene unit between the amide and
the phenyl ring (i.e., arylacetamide) was believed to be a critical motif for potency (3), whereas bromo substitution was
ineffective at increasing potency (13, 15). Nonetheless, molecular modeling studies revealed a channel near the ligand
binding site where a halogen atom could potentially interact
(15). Halogenated ligands are all particularly attractive for
use in medicine and biology as either a radiodiagnostic
(18F), a radiotherapeutic (131I), or a molecular structure tool
(Cl or Br). In the latter example, either chloro or bromo ligands could be used to provide valuable molecular insight
into the integrin structure in either photoaffinity crosslinking/mass spectroscopy experiments (Cl, 3:1 35 Cl:37 C;
Br, 1:1 79Br:81Br), as well as cocrystallization X-ray studies
(heavy atom effect). This provided the impetus behind the
synthesis of halobenzimidazole analogues 10 to 13
(Supplementary Scheme 1).
Although milder tandem reactions have been recently developed to afford m- and p-azole esters in good yields (30,
31), the reaction conditions shown in Supplementary
Scheme 1 quarter the amount of time to deliver halobenzimidazole acids 10 to 13 through microwave-mediated
chemistry (32). Briefly, commercially available aniline esters
were treated with thiophosgene to afford the aryl isothiocyanate ester 9 in 83% yield. Following purification by short
path column chromatography, this aryl isothiocyanate ester

was reacted with 4-halo-o-phenylenediamine to yield an intermediate bisaryl thiourea that, in the presence of 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide, was cyclized to yield crude benzimidazole
esters and 1,3-diisopropylthiourea as a by-product. These esters are rapidly saponified to afford halobenzimidazole acids
10 to 13 (64–89% yield) that are analytically pure following
acidification and filtration (33). This streamlined route, coupled with previous reports focusing on milder reagents and
conditions that minimize purification (15, 30), significantly

improves the preparation of these medicinally pertinent azole
heterocycles which are present in nearly one-quarter of the
top 100 drugs (34).
With these halobenzimidazole acids in hand, effort was
then directed towards the synthesis of target molecules
3 to 6 (Supplementary Scheme 2). The tripeptide 14, prepared previously from Rink amide resin (13), was N-acylated
with halobenzimidazole acid precursors 10 to 13, followed by
acid-mediated deprotection and resin cleavage to afford

crude 3 to 6. Purification by RP-HPLC and lyophilization delivered pure halobenzimidazole carboxamide analogues 3 to
6 in 22% to 46% overall yield from Rink amide resin.
In vitro biological evaluation
Halobenzimidazole carboxamide analogues 3 to 6 were
then subjected to cell adhesion competitive inhibition assays to determine in vitro activity and potency. The 25-mer
peptide CS-1 (DELPQLVTLPHPNLHGPEILDVPST), the
binding motif of fibronectin to α4β1 integrin, provides a
natural ligand to measure the binding affinities (IC50) of
the halobenzimidazole carboxamide analogues 3 to 6.
Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with neutravidin followed by treatment of biotinylated CS-1 to immobilize the
natural ligand to the well of the plate. The remaining non–
neutravidin-bound sites were blocked with bovine serum
albumin and the wells were incubated with Molt-4 cells
(human T-cell leukemia containing α4β1 integrin). The plates
were then washed, fixed with formalin, stained with crystal
violet, and absorbance (570 nm) was measured using a UV/
Vis spectrophotometer equipped to read 96-well plates. Inhibition was calculated as a percentage resulting from the concentration-dependent curve (see Supplementary Materials),
with the potency of 3 to 6 shown in Fig. 2A. Although all
compounds have an affinity for α4β1 integrin at <5 nmol/L,
these data suggest that the type of halogen atom plays a critical role for ultrapotency in this class of halobenzimidazole
analogues. The bromo, fluoro, and iodo derivatives are particularly promising; the bromo compound 5 is only 2-fold less
potent than previous leads (4, 19), whereas the fluoro (3) and
iodo (6) analogues could potentially be highly potent radiodiagnostic (F-18) and radiotherapeutic (I-131) agents.
Structure-activity relationship and theoretical
calculations
Interestingly, the structure-activity relationship for this
class of benzimidazole carboxamides (see Fig. 2A) revealed
that both the unsubstituted benzimidazole (15a; ref. 13) and

www.aacrjournals.org

56-methylbenzimidazole (15b; ref. 15) were 1,000-fold less
potent than fluoro, chloro, and bromo analogues 3 to 5 as
well as 100-fold less potent than iodo analogue 6. These data
suggest that hydrophobic interactions were not responsible
for ultrapotency, as both 15a and 15b were equipotent. Additionally, steric interactions were also not responsible, as
1,000-fold difference was seen between isosteres 15a and 3
as well as 15b and 4. Electrostatic interactions were also examined; however, these interactions were not important as
the electrostatic potential of 3 to 6 and 15a and 15b (see
Fig. 2B) did not correlate with the observed potency. Therefore, attention turned towards aryl halide–derived interactions which have occurred in prior systems through aryl
halide–H bonding (35) or halogen-carbonyl dipole-dipole
interactions (36, 37).
To further understand if the aryl halide–H-bond and/or dipole-dipole interactions were involved, the binding energy
(Ebind) was estimated for 3 to 6 (see Fig. 2A) using the equation Ebind = RT * ln[IC50(X = halogen)/IC50(X = H)], where R is
the gas constant and T is the temperature at 25°C. Quantum
mechanical calculations were performed where halobenzimidazoles interacted with primary amide (i.e., Asn/Gln), ammonium (Lys), or carboxylate (Asp/Glu) side chains.
Interestingly, only calculations involving the interaction
between the primary amide side chain of Asn or Gln with
halobenzimidazoles gave results consistent with the experimental observations, thereby eliminating Lys, Asp, and Glu
residues as well as charge-transfer interactions. These data
suggest that the nature of either the H-bond donor or
carbonyl source is critical for ultrapotency.
The nature of the amide-aryl halide interaction was elucidated by investigating the geometries and interaction energies of both the carbonyl oxygen and the amide N–H
interacting with the halobenzimidazole. Having the hydrogen N–H interacting with the halogen gave a stabilizing interaction for halobenzamidazoles 3 to 6. Although the
carbonyl oxygen interacting with heavier halo analogues 4
to 6 was stabilizing, it was unfavorable when interacting

with fluoro analogue 3. The gas phase–calculated interaction
energies (IE) were then determined at the MP2/6-311++G(d,
p)//B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level and ranged from 3.5 to 4.0
kcal/mol as shown in the chart of Fig. 2A. These IE values were
primarily due to the H-bond between the primary amide of
Asn161 (α4 subunit) and the halobenzimidazole moiety. The
IE values predict that fluoro analogue 3 would be the most potent; however, all IE values are very close (within 0.5 kcal/mol)
and were comparable with experimentally observed Ebind values. The variation in potency is likely explained by bromo analogue 5 having the halogen with the requisite van der Waal's
atomic radii (2.00 Å for Br; ref. 38) and positioning of the halogen atom (105.8° angle of the C(O)NRH⋯X-Ar H-bond, where
X is the central atom of the angle and a halogen, is taken from
the minimized energy structures shown generically in Fig. 2A)
allowing for this key amide-halogen H-bond (bond length between H⋯X = 2.87 Å), whereas permitting other moieties to interact with the α4 and β1 subunits (such as the butanoate-Mg2+
interaction at the MIDAS site of the β1 subunit; ref. 15). This
theory helps explain why the larger iodo analogue 6 (the poorest H-bond acceptor) is approximately 10-fold less potent than
the fluoro (3), chloro (4), and bromo (5) analogues and 100fold more potent than the unsubstituted (15a) and methyl
analogues (15b).
Radioiodination via aromatic Finkelstein and initial
biodistribution studies
The condensed radioiodide derivatives 7 and 8 were attractive targets to potentially serve as therapeutic or diagnostic
agents for T- and B-cell lymphomas. Radioiodo derivative 7
was particularly attractive, as this could be synthesized from
the bromo analogue 5 in a copper-mediated radioiodination
(39, 40). Buchwald's copper(I)-mediated aromatic Finkelstein
reaction with cold sodium iodide (i.e., ArBr → ArI) that proceeds with average yields of 97% for many aryl and heteroaryl
systems seemed a highly promising route to deliver the I-125
enriched 7 from the aryl bromide 5 (Supplementary Scheme 3;
ref. 41). In our hands, this method for radiohalogenation was
unsuccessful, presumably due to the structural sophistication

of 5 with several potential heteroatoms available for copper
chelation. However, treatment of 5 with [125I]NaI/chloramine
T successfully delivered 7 with a radiochemical yield of 20%
and a specific activity of 1.0 μCi/μg (125I T1/2 = ∼60 d).
Concurrently, Raji cells (human B-cell lymphoma), which
abundantly express α4β1 integrin (16), were cultured, centrifuged, and injected into 11 female BALB/c nude mice. These
xenograft tumors were allowed to grow to 50 to 200 mm. The I125 analogue 7 was then injected into the tail vein, with animals sacrificed and organs and tumors removed, weighed, and
counted after 24 and 48 hours. Although only one dose formulation was given and dose injections were performed at the
same time in an identical manner for all mice, the blood clearance and biodistribution data allowed us to separate the mice
into two groups: one with slow blood clearance and one with
fast blood clearance (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). Three
mice showed slow clearances (two mice at 24 h and one mouse
at 48 h). These mice had approximately 15% still circulating in
the blood thus providing high tumor uptakes of >6% ID/g. The
liver, spleen, and marrow uptakes were <8% ID/g at 48 hours.
However, five mice (three mice at 24 h and two mice at 48 h)
showed that 7 was cleared rapidly from the blood and body.
The major dose (25% ID/g) was mainly accumulated in the liver, spleen, and marrow, whereas the tumor uptake of these
mice was very low (<1.5% ID/g).
Although these preliminary data have low statistical significance, we believe these results warrant further discussion and
might be due to one or more factors. The radioiodo analogue
7, having reduced in vitro affinity for α4β1 integrin by nearly
10-fold compared with bromo analogue 5, may have decreased
in vivo affinity and selectivity. The iodobenzamidyl moiety of 7
might also be metabolically degraded, as seen with p-radioiodobenzamide derivatives (42, 43). Although we did not see
in vitro peptide aggregation of 7, it has been reported that
the fast clearance patterns might be due to in vivo aggregation
resulting in ineffective tumor targeting (44).
Radioiodination via electrophilic aromatic substitution
In addition to these mixed in vivo results (Supplementary
Figs. S1 and S2), 7 was difficult to prepare in high radiochemical yield and crude purity. This provided the impetus for the
synthesis of 3-radioiodotyrosine-derivative 8, as tyrosine
residues are rapidly radioiodinated with high regio- and
chemoselectively (21, 45). Moreover, previous optical conjugates 1-Cy5.5 and 2-Cy5.5 showed that the primary amide
was successfully modified to a secondary amide without affecting activity, potency, or selectivity (3, 12, 14–16). With this
in mind, Rink amide resin was first swollen in DMF for 3 hours,
followed by Fmoc-deprotection and N-acylation with semiorthogonally protected tyrosine to deliver the tyrosylated resin
16 (Supplementary Scheme 2). This resin was further elaborated into the bromobenzimidazole tetrapeptide 17 through
analogous chemistry (Supplementary Scheme 2) and further
elaborated elsewhere (15). This tyrosine derivative 17 was then
rapidly radioiodinated using I-125–enriched sodium iodide
with iodogen as an oxidant to afford the 3-radioiodo tyrosine
derivative 8 in 90% radiochemical yield and with a specific activity of 2 μCi/μg. Unfortunately, 8 performed poorly in in vitro

Halogenated Benzimidazole Antagonists of α4β1 Integrin

binding studies (<4%) and thus in vivo studies were not pursued. However, these in vitro results should not necessarily be
viewed detrimentally; the o-hydroxyl group has been known to
weaken the carbon-iodine bond and radioiodotyrosine derivatives have been known to undergo in vivo degradation due to
their structural similarities to thyroid hormones (46).
Radioiodination via succinimidyl ester chemistry and
biodistribution studies
Attention was then turned towards the synthesis of 4radioiodobenzamidolysine-derivative 18, as the bulkiness
of the iodotyrosine may contribute to the poor in vitro
binding. Rink amide resin was first swollen in DMF for
3 hours, followed by Fmoc-deprotection and N-acylation
with Fmoc-Lys(Dde)-OH to deliver resin 19 (Fig. 3). Resin
19 was further elaborated into resin 20 through analogous
chemistry (Supplementary Scheme 2) and described elsewhere (15). N-acylation of 20 with Fmoc-Lys(Alloc)-OH
was followed by Fmoc-deprotection, and then coupling
with bromobenzimazole acid 5. Alloc deprotection,
followed by N-acylation with trans-3-(3-pyridyl)acrylic acid,
Dde deprotection, and trifluoroacetic acid cleavage yielded
21. The lysinated bromobenzimadole 21 was radioiodinated
by coupling the free amine of the lysine with the NHS-ester
of I-125 enriched 4-iodobenzoic acid [prepared from paminobenzoic acid as outlined by Khalaj and colleagues
(47)] to afford the 4-radioiodobenzamidolysine derivative
18 in 47% radiochemical yield and with a specific activity
of 1.7 μCi/μg.
To study the preliminary biodistribution of 18, Raji cells
(human B-cell lymphoma) expressing α 4β1 integrin were
cultured, centrifuged, and injected into six nude mice. These
xenograft tumors were grown to 50 to 200 mm. The I-125
analogue 18 was then injected into the tail vein, with half of
the animals being sacrificed after 24 and 48 hours. As shown
in Fig. 4, the organs and tumors were removed and counted
with 18 having good tumor uptake (12 ± 1% ID/g at 24 h and
4.5 ± 1% ID/g at 48 h) and minimal uptake in other organs.
In particular, the low kidney uptake [tumor/kidney(t = 24 h)
∼4:1; tumor/kidney(t = 48 h) ∼2.5:1] was encouraging as this,
in this initial assessment, has shown that radiolabeledazole
analogue 18 might be a promising payload-ligand conjugate
for targeting activated α4β1 integrin–expressed tumors.

Conclusion
The results presented have shown the importance of advancing leads to target cancerous but not normal cells by exploiting the conformational differences of α4β1 integrin. The

synthesis of azole heterocycles, which previously required
harsh reaction conditions, long reaction times, and highly
toxic reagents, can now be rapidly prepared through microwave-mediated synthesis using safer reagents with minimal
purification. This report also provides an excellent example
of how molecular models could be used as a guide to predict
analogues that will have high affinity and to understand key
weak force interactions. The potency of this unique class of
compounds is likely attributed to a key aryl halide-hydrogen
bond between the halobenzimidazole moiety and the primary amide side chain of Asn161 in the α4 subunit. In preliminary studies, the condensed radioiodobenzimidazole
analogue 18 has shown that a low tumor/kidney ratio may
be achievable with a covalently attached radiolabeled modality, while minimizing the size and cost of the payload-ligand
conjugate. These halobenzimidazoles are particularly attractive as this allows for the design of highly condensed
ligand-payload conjugates for radiotherapeutic (I-131) and
radiodiagnostic (F-18) agents for selectively detecting and
treating T- and B-cell lymphomas that express α4β1 integrin.
Additionally, the bromo analogue 5 could provide valuable
molecular insights into the binding site and integrin structure through photoaffinity cross-linking/mass spectroscopy
(1:1 79Br:81Br) as well as cocrystallization X-ray studies (heavy
atom effect).
