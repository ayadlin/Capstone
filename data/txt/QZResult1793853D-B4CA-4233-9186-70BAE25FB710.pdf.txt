BACKGROUND: Recent attention has focused on the negative effects of chemotherapy on the cognitive performance
of cancer survivors. The current study examined modification of this risk by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)
genotype based on evidence in adult populations that the presence of a Val allele is associated with poorer cognitive
performance. METHODS: Breast cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy (n ¼ 58), and/or chemotherapy (n ¼ 72),
and 204 healthy controls (HCs) completed tests of cognitive performance and provided saliva for COMT genotyping.
COMT genotype was divided into Val carriers (Valþ; Val/Val, Val/Met) or COMT-Met homozygote carriers (Met; Met/
Met). RESULTS: COMT-Valþ carriers performed more poorly on tests of attention, verbal fluency, and motor speed
relative to COMT-Met homozygotes. Moreover, COMT-Valþ carriers treated with chemotherapy performed more
poorly on tests of attention relative to HC group members who were also Valþ carriers. CONCLUSIONS: The results
suggest that persons treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer who also possess the COMT-Val gene are susceptible to negative effects on their cognitive health. This research is important because it strives to understand the factors that predispose some cancer survivors to more negative quality-of-life outcomes. Cancer 2011;117:1369–76.

KEYWORDS: cancer survivor, cognitive performance, genetics, research methods.

In recent years there has been considerable interest in quality-of-life outcomes among adult cancer survivors.1 For
example, attention has been directed at the topic of ‘‘chemobrain,’’ or the presence of deficits in cognitive performance
associated with treatment for cancer.2-4 Statistically significant differences5,6 on multiple domains of cognitive performance have been observed between cancer survivors and controls with no history of cancer, as well as among cancer
survivors as a function of treatment modality. More recently, investigators have sought to elucidate factors that may
influence cognitive functioning among cancer patients including psychological, physiological, demographic, and
genetic determinants.7-9
The potential for genetic variation to affect cognitive quality-of-life outcomes among cancer survivors has been
examined only once before, by Ahles et al.10 They reported that the presence of an e4 polymorphism of apolipoprotein E
(APOE), a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD)11 and poorer cognitive performance among persons without dementia,12,13 was associated with poorer performance on tests of verbal memory and spatial ability among breast cancer and lymphoma survivors treated with chemotherapy. However, this study was characterized by small sample sizes, lack
of a control group with no history of cancer, as well as an inability to examine treatment effects because all patients were
treated with the standard dose of chemotherapy.
The current article focuses on the moderating role of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype on cognitive performance following treatment for breast cancer. The COMT genotype is associated with levels of dopamine (DA)

The impact of cancer treatment on cognitive performance is an important quality-of-life outcome for cancer survivors. In this study, the authors demonstrated
that breast cancer survivors who were treated with chemotherapy were at the greatest risk of cognitive impairment if they carried the catechol-O-methyltransferase Val gene.

in the prefrontal cortex.14 The COMT Val158Met single-nucleotide polymorphism leads to a substitution of valine (Val) with methionine (Met) at codon 158 on
chromosome 22q11. The presence of the Val allele of
COMT (Valþ, Met/Val, Val/Val) is related to 3 to 4
times higher enzymatic activity, compared with that in
COMT-Met (Met/Met) homozygote carriers.15 As a
result, COMT-Valþ carriers have greater degradation of
DA and less availability of this neurotransmitter at synaptic receptors. Several studies have reported that COMTValþ carriers perform more poorly on tests of attention
and executive function, abilities heavily influenced by the
integrity of the frontal lobes, than do COMT-Met
carriers.15,16
The potential for the COMT genotype to influence
cognitive functioning in cancer survivors is suggested by
recent work examining neuroimaging correlates of chemotherapy treatment for cancer. Two studies reported that
persons treated with chemotherapy had greater activation
in the frontal lobes, as shown with functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI)17 or positron emission tomography18 imaging, compared with persons who did not
receive this treatment. This pattern of increased activation
was interpreted as a compensatory mechanism so that persons treated with chemotherapy had to recruit additional
brain structures to perform the same cognitive task. To
the extent that the greater activation is limited by DA
losses in the frontal lobes associated with the COMT genotype, this may affect the cognitive functioning of persons treated with chemotherapy.
In the current study, we examined the influence of
the COMT genotype on cognitive performance among
women with no history of cancer, women treated for
breast cancer with chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy, and women treated for breast cancer with radiotherapy only. We predicted that 1) women treated with
chemotherapy would perform more poorly than women
treated with radiotherapy only and women without a history of cancer, 2) COMT-Valþ carriers would perform
more poorly relative to COMT-Met carriers, especially
on tests that are heavily dependent on frontal lobe integrity, and 3) women who are COMT-Valþ carriers treated
with chemotherapy would be most impaired on tests of
cognitive performance. The current study builds on our
previous work,4 which reported small but statistically significant treatment group differences in tests of attention
and complex cognition. In the current study, we examined
a subset of these participants,19 who provided a DNA
sample for COMT genotyping.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Breast cancer survivors

As part of a larger study examining quality of life
during and after breast cancer treatment, women diagnosed with stages 0 to II breast cancer were recruited at
the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (HLMCC) at the University of South Florida and the Markey Cancer Center
(MCC) at the University of Kentucky (a detailed description of inclusion and exclusion criteria was reported previously4). Groups were categorized as those who received
only chest wall radiotherapy as part of treatment (radiotherapy [RT]) and those who received chest wall radiotherapy plus a minimum of 4 cycles of standard-dose
chemotherapy or a minimum of 4 cycles of standard-dose
chemotherapy alone (CT; mean number of cycles of
chemotherapy, 5.61; standard deviation [SD], 1.84). The
chemotherapy regimens (with percentage of the sample in
parentheses) were: anthracycline and cyclophosphamide
(51.52%); anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and taxane
(31.82%); cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (9.09%); anthracycline and taxane (1.52%);
anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil
(3.03%); and anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, and taxane (3.03%).
Noncancer controls

Potential healthy control participants (HCs) were
identified using a database maintained by Marketing Systems Group, Inc. (Fort Washington, PA) that draws from
all listed telephone households in the United States and is
estimated to include demographic and contact information for approximately two-thirds of the US population.4
Measures
Demographic and clinical data

Demographic data were obtained from all participants via a self-report measure. Survivor disease and treatment information was collected via medical chart review.
Cognitive performance

Cognitive performance was assessed using a battery
of neuropsychological tests to evaluate overall intellectual
ability as well as 5 major domains of cognitive functioning, which were based on our previous research.4,20
Overall intellectual ability

The National Adult Reading Test (NART)21 was
administered to estimate overall intellectual ability, and

the results are expressed as Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale (WAIS)-R full-scale intelligence scores.
Episodic memory

The composite variable for this domain was constructed with 3 items (free recall–short delay, free recall–
long delay, and discrimination) from the California
Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)22 and 3 items (immediate
recall, delayed recall, and delayed recognition) from the
Visual Reproduction subtest of the Wechsler Memory
Scales-III (WMS-III).23
Attention

The Digit Span and the Spatial Span subtests of the
WAIS-III24 and trial 1 from the Color Trails Test25 were
administered to assess attention.
Complex cognition

The Digit Symbol subtest of the WAIS-III24 and
trial 2 of the Color Trails Test25 were administered to
assess complex cognition.
Verbal fluency

The Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA)
test26 was administered to assess verbal fluency.
Motor speed

The Finger Oscillation Test27 (dominant and nondominant hands) was used to assess motor speed.
DNA Collection and COMT Genotyping
DNA was extracted from saliva collected using DNA
Genotek Oragene saliva collection kits (Ottawa, ON,
Canada). Saliva samples were divided into 500-mL aliquots and sent to a core facility at the HLMCC for DNA
extraction using a Qiagen Universal Biorobot system
(Valencia, CA) with an RNA carrier. The COMT
(Val158Met) genotype was determined using Taqman
gene expression assays from Applied Biosystems (Foster
City, CA) for rs4680.
Procedures
All procedures were approved by the institutional review
boards at both study sites, and participants provided written informed consent. Potential participants were contacted by telephone or mail, informed of the current
study, and invited to participate. Study materials were
mailed and participants returned a signed copy of the consent form, saliva sample, and completed study questionnaires via mail. Cognitive performance was measured in

person at HLMCC or MCC for all participants as part of
the larger study on breast cancer and quality of life. For
cancer survivors, cognitive performance was assessed
approximately 6 months following the completion of
treatment (mean (M)RT, 6.16 months; SDRT, 1.24
months; MCT, 6.64 months; SDCT, 2.07 months; P >
.10).
Statistical Analyses
Consistent with the administration manuals, raw scores
from the CVLT,22 WMS-III,23 and WAIS-III24 subtests
were converted to age-corrected t scores. Raw scores from
the COWA were converted to education-corrected t
scores.26 Raw scores from the Color Trails Test25 and the
Finger Oscillation Test27 were converted to age-corrected
and education-corrected t scores. A composite overall cognition score was also created by average performance
across the 5 individual domains. In all cases, higher scores
indicate better performance.
Differences in age, education, and NART were
examined using 3 (group: HC, RT, CT)  2 (COMT:
Met, Valþ) analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Variables
that differed significantly between groups (P < .05) were
entered as covariates in later analyses. To examine meanlevel differences in cognitive functioning, a series of
3 (group: HC, RT, CT)  2 (COMT: Met, Valþ)
ANOVAs were applied to data from each cognitive outcome, as well as for the composite measure of overall
cognitive performance. COMT genotype was classified as
COMT-Valþ carriers (Valþ; Met/Val, Val/Val) or
COMT-Met homozygote carriers. The data met assumptions for distributional normality and homogeneity of variances. To examine differences in rates of cognitive
impairment, participants were categorized as impaired or
unimpaired on individual domains based on being 1.5
SD below normative values.28-31 Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine whether group, COMT
genotype, and their interaction were related to rates of
impairment. In addition, the number of impaired
domains was compared using a 3 (group)  2 (COMT)
ANOVA.

Sample Characteristics
Demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Three (group)  2 (COMT) ANOVAs on age, years of
education, and NART scores indicated that the groups
were significantly different in age, with the CT group

did not differ from one another. Consequently, age was
used as a covariate in the analyses that follow. The 3
groups were similar in years of education and NART
score. There was no main effect of COMT genotype or an
interaction between group and genotype for age, years of
education, or NART score.
There were no statistically significant differences in
the distribution of COMT genotype across the 3 groups
(v2 [2] ¼ 1.75; P > .05). COMT genotype was in HardyWeinberg equilibrium for the groups as a whole (v2 [2] ¼
0.17), as well as within the HC, RT, and CT groups (v2
[2] ¼ 0.46, 1.04, and 1.94, respectively). Clinically, persons treated with chemotherapy were more likely to have a
more advanced stage of cancer at diagnosis (v2 [2] ¼
56.47; P < .001) and were more likely to receive a mastectomy as the surgical option (v2 [1] ¼ 11.35; P < .001).
There were no treatment group differences in current hormone therapy or postmenopausal status.

Mean-Level Cognitive Performance
Means and standard deviations for the cognitive outcomes
are shown in Table 2. Only COMT genotype was significantly related to composite cognitive performance, with
COMT-Met carriers (mean, 52.01; standard error [SE],
0.65) outperforming COMT-Val carriers (mean, 49.72;
SE, 0.37; P ¼ .002; d ¼ 0.39). The main effects of group
and group  COMT genotype interaction were not statistically significant for the composite measure of cognitive
performance.
The results of the mean-level comparisons for the
individual domains of performance revealed that the effect
of group was statistically significant for motor speed. Post
hoc comparisons with Holm-Bonferroni correction32
indicated that the HC group (mean, 44.71; SE, 0.86) performed more poorly than the RT group (mean, 49.65;
SE, 1.54; P ¼ .007; d ¼ 0.41) and the CT group (mean,
49.83; SE, 1.61; P ¼ .005; d ¼ 0.41), who did not differ
from one another. For the main effect of COMT

observed for attention (MMet, 54.43, SEMet, 0.79; MValþ,
52.19, SEValþ, 0.45; P ¼ .015; d ¼ 0.31), verbal fluency
(MMet, 51.45, SEMet, 1.35; MValþ, 47.35, SEValþ, 0.77;
P ¼ .009; d ¼ 0.34), and motor speed (MMet, 49.76,
SEMet, 1.38; MValþ, 46.37, SEValþ, 0.78; P ¼ .033; d ¼
0.27), the latter effect was not statistically significant after
correcting for multiple comparisons. In all cases, the
COMT-Valþ carriers performed more poorly than did
the COMT-Met homozygote carriers.

Finally, a statistically significant group  COMT genotype interaction was seen for attention (P ¼ .019).
Comparisons between the COMT alleles within each
group revealed statistically significant genotype differences
in favor of the COMT-Met carriers within the CT group
(P < .001; d ¼ 0.96), but not in the HC or RT groups.
Among COMT-Met carriers, the CT group outperformed
the RT group (P ¼ .029; d ¼ 0.81), and among COMTVal carriers, the HC group outperformed the CT group
(P ¼ .049; d ¼ 0.27), although neither effect was significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Across the
5 cognitive domains, the mean difference between COMT
genotype groups was not statistically significant for the
HC and RT groups (d ¼ 0.14; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.01 to 0.28 [d ¼ 0.14]; 95% CI, 0.12 to
0.39, respectively). However, the mean difference between
genotypes across cognitive domains in the CT group was
almost half a standard deviation (d ¼ 0.46; 95% CI, 0.200.73), in favor of the COMT-Met carriers.

Prevalence of Cognitive Impairment
The rates of impairment in the cognitive domains are
shown in Table 3. What is clear from the table is that the
impairment rates were very low. Mean-level comparisons
of number of impaired domains did not reveal any statistically significant effects of group or COMT genotype.
Similarly, despite the finding that the COMT-Val carriers
who received chemotherapy appeared to have higher rates
of impairment, none of the group  COMT genotype

chemotherapy performed similarly on most tests of cognitive performance compared with women with no history
of cancer; 2) COMT-Val carriers performed more poorly
than COMT-Met homozygote carriers on tests of attention, verbal fluency, and motor speed; and 3) COMT-Val
carriers treated with chemotherapy performed more
poorly than women with no history of breast cancer on
tests of attention. The results of this study are innovative
in that they represent the first demonstration of a link
between a risk factor for poorer cognitive performance,
COMT genotype, and cognitive deficits associated with
chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer.
The lack of statistically significant differences
between the breast cancer survivors and healthy controls
irrespective of genotype is surprising given that previous
research28,33 has demonstrated cognitive deficits associated with breast cancer treatment. Moreover, the only
group difference that was statistically significant was in
favor of the RT and CT groups for motor speed. This
finding was unexpected and should be treated with caution because chemotherapy treatment for cancer, especially with taxane-based therapies, is often associated with
peripheral neuropathy.34 The relatively short interval in
the present study between the end of treatment and the
assessment of cognitive performance in the cancer survivors may have worked against observing substantial deficits in cognitive functioning among this group. The
majority of studies30,33,35 that have reported statistically
significant differences between cancer survivors and
healthy controls have tested cognitive performance many
years after the end of treatment.
The results indicating statistically significant differences in favor of the COMT-Met homozygote carriers in
tests of attention, verbal fluency, and motor speed are in
line with previous reports.15,16,36 Moreover, the specificity of these effects is consistent with the importance of the
frontal lobes for attentional and executive functioning
cognitive abilities,15 as well as the mechanism of action of
COMT genotype on DA in the frontal lobes. However, a
recent meta-analysis37 reported equivocal evidence for a
relationship between the COMT polymorphism and cognitive performance. Specifically, they failed to observe significant effects of COMT genotype on measures of verbal
fluency and Trailmaking, one of the components of the
attention domain score. However, the meta-analytic
results were from a variety of subject populations, including many individuals with schizophrenia.
The results of the present study also indicated that
COMT genotype modified the presence of cognitive dif-

1374

ferences as a function of cancer treatment. The poorer performance on the domain of attention among COMT-Val
carriers treated with chemotherapy, compared with
healthy controls, is consistent with predictions based on
the impact of chemotherapy on the frontal lobes of cancer
survivors,5,6 as well as the role of DA in the functioning of
these brain structures. However, this is not to say that cognitive deficits after treatment for cancer are necessarily a
frontal lobe syndrome, because the existing meta-analyses5,6 have failed to observe any dominant pattern of deficits that could be associated with a particular brain region,
and the neuroimaging evidence was based on 2 studies
with small sample sizes. The tests used to assess the domain of complex cognition in the current study also
appear to be heavily dependent on frontal lobe functioning; they did not produce a statistically significant interaction between COMT genotype and group status.
However, the main effect of COMT genotype on this
cognitive domain also was not statistically significant, and
this may have mitigated against observing statistically significant variation as a function of group status.
Finally, results indicated that COMT-Met carriers
treated with chemotherapy exhibited superior performance on tests of attention relative to COMT-Val carriers
in the CT group and to COMT-Met carriers treated with
radiation. The reason for this pattern of results is unclear.
It does not appear to simply reflect the cognitive superiority of this group. For example, episodic memory performance, a domain largely unaffected by COMT genotype,37
did not differ between COMT-Met carriers treated with
chemotherapy and the other groups. Perhaps the greater
brain activation required for breast cancer survivors
treated with chemotherapy to maintain cognitive abilities17,18 and the higher levels of DA associated with the
COMT-Met genotype are the source of this superior performance. Further research, using larger samples of
COMT-Met carriers, is necessary to replicate and extend
the results observed here.
The results of the present study can be placed in the
context of ‘‘personalized medicine,’’ whereby treatments
for various diseases are tailored to the genetic characteristics of individuals.38,39 Our results suggest that persons
who are COMT-Val carriers and have received chemotherapy as part of their treatment for breast cancer are
more likely to exhibit poorer performance on attentional
tasks relative to women not treated for cancer. Together
with evidence from Ahles et al10 on poorer cognitive performance among cancer survivors with the e4 allele of
APOE, these results suggest that the presence of poorer

Cancer

April 1, 2011

COMT Genotype and Cognitive Performance/Small et al

cognitive quality of life outcomes among cancer survivors
may be related to genetic variation among individuals.
The lack of overlap in the genotype/cognitive domain
interactions seen here (ie, attention) and the impact on
tests of memory and spatial ability reported by Ahles
et al10 are consistent with the locus of the COMT and
APOE gene effects on brain function and cognitive performance. These results suggest that multiple genetic
polymorphisms may impact different cognitive abilities
among cancer survivors.
Do the results observed here for COMT-Val carriers, as well as those reported for APOE-e4 carriers, mean
that these persons should not receive chemotherapy as
part of their treatment for breast cancer for fear of negative
repercussions on their long-term cognitive health? Among
persons treated with chemotherapy, the average difference
between the COMT-Met and Val carriers was almost half
a standard deviation. The differences as a function of
APOE genotype observed by Ahles et al10 were slightly
smaller but still greater than 0.25 SD. It is unlikely that
differences such as these will alter clinical practice for
COMT-Val or APOE-e4 carriers, but attention should be
paid to the interaction of treatment and genetic predisposition in terms of long-term quality-of-life outcomes
among cancer survivors.
Although the results of the present study are informative, a number of limitations should be acknowledged.
First, the sample was composed primarily of white
women. Thus, the extent to which the results observed
here can be generalized to more diverse populations is
unclear. Second, the sample sizes examined here, especially for some of the group by genotype pairs were small,
and this limited statistical power to detect effects; also,
several effects were no longer statistically significant after
correcting for multiple comparisons. Moreover, the small
sample sizes did not permit us to examine dose-response
relationships among persons who were COMT-Val carriers in terms of the presence of 1 or 2 copies of the Val allele. The decision to compare COMT-Val carriers with
COMT-Met homozygote carriers was made to ensure sufficiently powerful statistical comparisons. With that said,
the sample sizes examined here were substantially larger
than those reported by Ahles et al,10 the only other study
to examine the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and cognitive performance among cancer survivors. Moreover, the current study also included a control
group with no history of cancer, which represents another
methodologic advantage over previous research. Third,
there was no pretreatment assessment of cognitive per-

formance for the breast cancer survivors; therefore, we
were unable to determine whether the functioning
observed in the current study differed from that prior to
cancer treatment. Future studies that incorporate a pretreatment assessment of cognitive performance and follow
participants longitudinally are necessary in order to
understand the nature and course of cognitive deficits
among persons treated for cancer.33 Finally, there was relatively low prevalence of cognitive impairment among
individuals in the current study.
In summary, the data from the current study suggest
that the COMT-Val allele conveys an added risk of poorer
cognitive performance among women treated for breast
cancer with chemotherapy. Research to identify not just
the presence of cognitive deficits associated with treatment for cancer but also risk factors that modify the likelihood of observing these differences is necessary to be able
to target the persons at greatest risk of impaired cognitive
functioning. It is likely that genetic factors such as
COMT and APOE genotype will continue to play an important role in our understanding of risk factors for poorer
cognitive health among cancer survivors.
