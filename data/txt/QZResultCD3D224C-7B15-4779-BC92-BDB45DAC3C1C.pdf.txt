Abstract
Aberrant nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) signaling plays a role in
cancer initiation and progression; thus, it represents a potential therapeutic target. We previously identified a mechanism
of repression of NF-KB transcriptional activity and induction of
apoptosis in colon cancer cells involving nuclear/nucleolar
translocation of the RelA (p65) component of NF-KB. This
response was stimulated by cellular stress-inducing agents,
including aspirin, but not by tumor necrosis factor. Here, we
investigate the upstream molecular mechanisms responsible
for nucleolar targeting of RelA and show that aspirin activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway in colorectal cancer cells. We also show that aspirin
causes rapid, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cyclin D1,
a known p38 target. Aspirin-induced p38 activation preceded
cyclin D1 degradation, which was then followed by activation
of the NF-KB pathway, suggesting a causative link. Indeed,
chemical p38 inhibition (PD169316) and small interfering
RNA directed against p38 blocked aspirin-induced cyclin D1
degradation, nucleolar translocation of RelA, and apoptosis.
Furthermore, chemical inhibition of the cyclin D1/cyclindependent kinase 4 (CDK4) kinase complex, used as a surrogate for cyclin D1 degradation, caused nucleolar translocation
of RelA, repression of KB-driven transcription, and apoptosis,
thereby reproducing the effects of aspirin. In addition, we
found that aspirin and the CDK4 inhibitor induced nucleolar
translocation of RelA and apoptosis through a common
mechanism involving the NH2-terminal nucleolar localization
signal. Collectively, these data suggest that aspirin causes inhibition of cyclin D1/CDK4 through the p38 MAPK pathway.
This inhibition stimulates the NF-KB pathway to induce nucleolar translocation of RelA and apoptosis. These novel findings
have considerable relevance to the rational design of novel
chemotherapeutic and chemopreventative strategies. [Cancer

Introduction
Nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) is a ubiquitously expressed, inducible
transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous
genes controlling inflammation, proliferation, differentiation, and
apoptosis (1). As appropriate regulation of these functions is
critical for normal tissue homeostasis and for the suppression of

tumor formation, NF-nB activity is generally tightly controlled. In
resting cells, the NF-nB complex, most commonly a heterodimer
of the p50/RelA (p65) polypeptides, is sequestered in the cytoplasm
by the inhibitor protein InB. Upon cellular stimulation by specific
agents, the InB protein is phosphorylated and then degraded by the
proteasome, enabling NF-nB to translocate to the nucleus and
regulate the transcription of target genes (2). Because NF-nB activates transcription of the InB inhibitor, this acts as a negative
feedback mechanism, ensuring that activation of the pathway is
transient. However, in many human cancers, including colorectal
cancer, NF-nB is aberrantly activated, and compelling evidence
indicates that this constitutive NF-nB activity contributes to the
carcinogenic process (3). For instance, suppression of NF-nB in cell
lines and tumors showing aberrant activity causes decreased
proliferation and apoptosis (4, 5). Oncogenes such as BCR-ABL and
Ras require NF-nB activity for cell transformation (6), and genetic
deletion of the NF-nB activator, IKK, can inhibit inflammationassociated cancer (7, 8). Hence, approaches that suppress the
NF-nB pathway or restore the feedback mechanisms that limit its
signaling response could have a significant therapeutic effect and
are currently the focus of intense investigation.
Recent data from this laboratory (9) has revealed a novel
mechanism for down-regulating NF-nB transcriptional activity and
inducing apoptosis of transformed cancer cells. We found that
activation of the NF-nB pathway by stress-inducing stimuli, such as
serum deprivation, UV-C radiation, and aspirin, caused the RelA
component of NF-nB to translocate from the cytoplasm to the
nucleoplasm and then to the nuclear compartment, the nucleolus.
In contrast, we found that RelA translocated to the nucleoplasm
but was excluded from the nucleolus in response to the cytokines
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand. We showed that nucleolar translocation of RelA
was paralleled by a decrease in the basal levels of NF-nB transcriptional activity and apoptosis, whereas TNF-induced accumulation of RelA in the nucleoplasm was associated with activation
of NF-nB transcription and inhibition of apoptosis (9). We identified a nucleolar localization signal at the NH2 terminus of RelA.
Moreover, by using a dominant-negative mutant deleted for the
nucleolar localization signal, we showed that nucleolar translocation of RelA was absolutely required for aspirin effects on
NF-nB–driven transcription and apoptosis.
Our data showing differing NF-nB responses to aspirin/stress–
inducing agents and TNF would suggest that these extracellular
stimuli activate the NF-nB pathway through distinct upstream
mechanisms. This notion is supported by our finding that aspirin
and other agents that induce nucleolar translocation of RelA
activate the NF-nB pathway with delayed kinetics, compared with
the rapid activation observed in response to TNF (10, 11). The
mode of TNF-induced NF-nB activation is well documented (1, 12).
However, the mechanisms that trigger activation of NF-nB in

response to other agents, particularly stress inducers, are still
poorly understood. Here, we investigate the upstream signaling
pathways that stimulate cytoplasmic-nuclear/nucleolar translocation of NF-nB/RelA. Identification of these pathways may allow the
design of a novel class of therapeutic agents that have the specific
effect of targeting RelA to the nucleolus, thus down-regulating
NF-nB transcriptional activity and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells.
One potential upstream candidate is the p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), which regulates inflammation, proliferation, and cell death. Activation of the p38 pathway is generally
mediated by conditions of cell stress and culminates in phosphorylation of p38 on a conserved regulatory domain by the upstream
kinases MKK3 and MKK6 (13). Once activated, p38 regulates
multiple cellular processes, including transcription, translation, cell
cycle progression, and apoptosis. Schwenger et al. (14) previously
showed that sodium salicylate, the active component of aspirin,
activates p38 to induce apoptosis, and the other stimuli we have
shown to cause nucleolar translocation of RelA, namely UV-C
radiation (15) and serum deprivation (16), are also known to
stimulate this pathway. Furthermore, p38 is reported to lie
upstream of NF-nB in response to proapoptotic stimuli such as
UV radiation (17). Therefore, using aspirin as a model stimulus, we
investigated the role of p38 in activation of the NF-nB pathway
associated with nucleolar targeting of RelA.
Here, we show that aspirin activates the p38 MAPK pathway,
leading to degradation of cyclin D1, nucleolar translocation of
RelA, and apoptosis. We also show that chemical inhibition of the
cyclin D1/CDK4 kinase complex mimics the effects of aspirin on
NF-nB and programmed cell death. These findings contribute to
our understanding of the complex intracellular signaling cascades
that mediate activation of the NF-nB pathway and apoptosis, and
reveal a novel mechanism of action of cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDK) inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. Culture of SW480 and HT-29 cells has been
previously described (18). The cells were plated at a density of 0.2  105/cm2
and were treated in 0.5% serum when they were 60% to 80% confluent.
Aspirin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in water using 10 N NaOH
and the pH was then adjusted to 7.0. SB203580, PD169316, MG132,
roscovitine, and the CDK4 inhibitor 2-bromo-12,13-dihydro-5H-indolo[2,3a]pyrrolo[3,4-c]carbazole-5,7(6H)-dione (also known as ‘‘4d’’), developed by
Zhu et al. (19), were all obtained from Calbiochem, dissolved in DMSO, and
added to the cells in L-15 with 0.5% FCS.
Western blot analysis. Following treatment, whole-cell extracts were
prepared using a commercially available lysis buffer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Signaling Technology), and Western blots
were done as described previously (9). The membranes were probed with
the following primary antibodies: phosphorylated p38 (Thr180/Tyr182),
phosphorylated MKK3/MKK6 (Ser189/207), and MKK3 (Cell Signaling
Technology); p38 (C-20) and InBa (C-21; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); cyclin
D1 (SP4; NeoMarkers, Inc.); and actin (Ab-1; Oncogene Research Products)
as a control for protein loading. The horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology
and Amersham Biosciences) and anti-mouse IgM (Calbiochem). To examine
the levels of nonphosphorylated proteins, the membranes were stripped
by heating at 60jC for 45 min in strip buffer [60 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.7),
with 2% SDS and 0.8% h-mercaptoethanol] and then blocked before
reprobing using a native antibody.
p38 kinase assay. A nonradioactive assay to determine p38 kinase
activity was done on cells treated as outlined above using a commercially
available kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Signaling
Technology). Briefly, 450 Ag of whole-cell protein extract were immunopre-

cipitated using an immobilized phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182)
monoclonal antibody overnight at 4jC. A kinase reaction was then conducted on the immunoprecipitate at 30jC for 30 min in a reaction
containing 200 Amol/L ATP and 2 Ag of activating transcription factor-2
(ATF-2)-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The extracts were then
subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above, using a
phosphorylated ATF-2 (Thr71) antibody to detect p38 kinase activity.
NF-KB electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays (EMSA) were done on nuclear protein extracts using NF-nB
consensus or activator protein-1 (AP-1) competitor oligonucleotides (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as previously described (20). To
examine the composition of the NF-nB DNA-binding complexes, EMSAs
were done on nuclear extracts that were preincubated with antibodies
directed against either p50 (C19) or RelA (C20 and F6; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) before the addition of the NF-nB consensus oligonucleotide.
Cell cycle analysis. SW480 cells were treated as described above,
harvested, then fixed in 70% ethanol and stored at 20jC before analysis.
The cells were incubated with staining solution [PBS containing 0.1% (v/v)
Triton X-100, 200 Ag/mL RNase A, and 20 Ag/mL propidium iodide, all from
Sigma] for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. A FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) was used to calculate the DNA content
(2N or 4N) of the population, with gates to discriminate between single
cells, debris or aggregates, using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). The
percentage of cells in G0-G1, S, or G2-M was determined from histograms
using markers on a linear scale with ModFit software.
Immunocytochemical staining. Immunochemistry and subsequent
fluorescent microscopy and image capture were done as previously
described (9). The primary antibodies used at 1:100 were as follows:
NF-nB p65 (RelA; C-20) and p38 (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); fibrillarin
(AFB01; Cytoskeleton, Inc.); cyclin D1 (SP4; NeoMarkers); and FLAG
(Sigma), which was used at 1:2,000. The FITC- and Texas red–conjugated
secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used at
a dilution of 1:200, and the cells were mounted using Vectashield (Vector
Laboratories) containing 1 Ag/mL 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Apoptosis assays. Staining for cell surface phosphatidylserine residues
was conducted using an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Oncogene
Research Products) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by fluorescent microscopy as
described previously (9).
Transfection with short inhibitory RNA. SW480 cells were grown to 50%
confluence, washed with PBS, and then transferred to L-15 medium containing 10% FCS without antibiotics. The cells were then transfected with
either p38a (5¶-UGAAGACUGUGAGCUGAAG) or scrambled (5¶-CAGUCGCGUUUGCGACUGG) small interfering RNA (siRNA; MWG Biotechnology)
using Oligofectamine reagent prepared in Opti-MEM–reduced serum medium
(both from Invitrogen, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The transfection medium was removed 48 h later and the cells
were treated with aspirin in reduced serum medium as described above.
Transfections and reporter assays. Cells were transfected with the
3enhancer CONA (3 nB ConA-Luc) NF-nB reporter (a kind gift from
Professor R.T. Hay) and pCMV-h-galactosidase (Promega) plasmids as
described previously (9). The relative luciferase activity was calculated as
the units of luciferase activity per unit of h-galactosidase activity. FLAGtagged vectors (a kind gift from Professor Jiahuai Han; ref. 21) expressing
either p38a wild-type (p38a WT) protein or a mutated form of p38a (dual
TGY phosphorylation site converted to AGF-p38a AF) were transfected into
SW480 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Immunocytochemistry was done on transfected cells as described above. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged
vector expressing WT RelA was a kind gift from E. Qwarnstrom. The mutant
protein, deleted for the nucleolar localization signal (D27–30), was
generated in this laboratory and has been described previously (9). The
cells were treated for 24 h after transfection with either 5 mmol/L aspirin or
2 Amol/L of the CDK4 inhibitor in reduced serum medium. The cellular
distribution of GFP-tagged RelA (either WT or D27–30) was examined using
an Axiovert 100 inverted microscope with a 40 objective lens and a
Chroma 83000 filter set to capture fluorescent and phase-contrast images.

Each channel was recorded independently and pseudocolor images were
superimposed. Images were captured using in-house scripts written for
IPLab Spectrum 3.6. Apoptosis was detected in transfected cells using the
procedure described elsewhere (9).
Statistical analysis. All graphs represent the mean of at least three

Results
Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway by aspirin. To
determine whether p38 signaling is involved in activation of the
NF-nB pathway associated with nucleolar translocation of RelA,
we initially examined the effects of aspirin on the p38 cascade in
SW480 colon cancer cells. Using Western blot analysis with
phosphospecific antibodies, we observed a rapid, dose- and timedependent phosphorylation of p38 after aspirin treatment (Fig. 1A
and B). In addition, phosphorylation of the upstream kinases,

Figure 1. Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway by aspirin. A, SW480 colorectal
cancer cells were treated with 5 mmol/L aspirin for the times indicated in minutes
(¶) and hours (h), and the levels of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated
p38 were detected by Western blot analysis. Actin was used to control for protein
loading. B, SW480 cells were cultured in the presence of aspirin at the
concentrations indicated for 16 h and the levels of phosphorylated and native
p38 were detected. C, SW480 cells were exposed to 5 mmol/L aspirin for 2 to
30 min, and the levels of phosphorylated and native MKK3/MKK6 were detected.
In addition, p38 kinase activity was determined using immunoprecipitated
phosphorylated p38 to phosphorylate ATF-2. The levels of phosphorylated
ATF-2 were then determined by Western blot analysis using a phosphospecific
antibody. D, HT-29 colorectal cancer cells were treated with 5 mmol/L aspirin
for the times indicated in hours, and p38 kinase activity and the levels of p38
protein were measured as described above.

MKK3/MKK6, also occurred rapidly in response to this agent
(Fig. 1C). Aspirin-induced phosphorylation of p38 was accompanied by an increase in the catalytic activity of the kinase, as evidenced by kinase assays using recombinant ATF-2 as a substrate
for phosphorylated p38, which had been immunoprecipitated from
aspirin-treated SW480 cells (Fig. 1C). Aspirin also induced the
catalytic activity of p38 kinase in HT-29 colon cancer cells, showing
that this effect is not exclusive to SW480 cells (Fig. 1D). Immunocytochemical analysis showed that these aspirin effects on p38
occurred before nuclear and nucleolar translocation of RelA,
suggesting the possibility that a causative link might exist (Fig. 2A;
refs. 9, 20). These data were confirmed using EMSAs, which
revealed that aspirin stimulated the translocation of a p50/RelA
complex to the nucleus and that this occurred after activation of
p38 (Fig. 2B and C).
Aspirin induces cyclin D1 degradation and cell cycle arrest.
p38 activity was observed minutes after aspirin treatment, whereas
nuclear translocation of NF-nB did not occur for several hours
(Figs. 1 and 2). Therefore, we hypothesized that p38 does not act
directly on components of the NF-nB pathway, but that an
intermediate signaling mechanism may be involved. One recognized target of the p38 kinase is the cell cycle protein, cyclin D1.
p38 phosphorylates cyclin D1 on Thr286 in response to osmotic
stress, and this phosphorylation targets the protein for degradation
by the proteasome, thus mediating cell cycle arrest (22). This is of
particular interest because salicylate and the stress-inducing agents
we have shown to cause nucleolar translocation of RelA have all
previously been shown to reduce cellular levels of cyclin D1 and
induce cell cycle arrest (23–25). Furthermore, perturbations in the
cell cycle can activate the NF-nB pathway (26). Therefore, we next
determined whether p38-mediated modulation of cyclin D1 was an
intermediate pathway in the aspirin effects on NF-nB.
Using Western blot analysis, we found that aspirin caused a rapid
decrease in the levels of cyclin D1 protein in both SW480 and HT-29
colon cancer cells (Fig. 3A and B). This decrease was blocked by
the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the
reduction in protein levels was caused by phosphorylation and
subsequent proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1. In addition, we
found that decreased cyclin D1 levels were accompanied by cell
cycle arrest (Fig. 3D), with a substantial increase in cells in S-phase
and G2-M, shifted from G0-G1, after aspirin exposure. Kinetic studies
indicated that the proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclin D1
occurred after activation of the p38 cascade, but before nuclear/
nucleolar translocation of RelA (Figs. 1A, 2A, and 3A). This supports
the notion that cyclin D1 is acting as an intermediate signal.
Blocking p38 activity attenuates aspirin effects on the cell
cycle and NF-KB pathway. To investigate whether there is a
causal relationship among aspirin-induced p38 activation, cell cycle
arrest, and NF-nB responses, we used two specific p38 inhibitors,
SB203580 and PD169316 (27, 28). Although both of these inhibitors
have been reported to block phosphorylation of p38 in response
to a variety of agents (29, 30), we found that only PD169316 inhibited aspirin-induced phosphorylation and kinase activity of p38
(Fig. 4A and data not shown). We then examined the effects of
p38 inhibition on aspirin-induced cyclin D1 degradation. We found
that PD169316 blocked the reduction in cyclin D1 protein levels,
whereas SB203580 had no effect (Fig. 4A). This finding is in keeping
with previous studies that have shown PD169316, but not
SB203580, inhibits apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal
and similar agents (31, 32). In view of these findings, we only used
PD169316 in subsequent studies.

Figure 2. p38 activation precedes aspirin effects on the
NF-nB pathway. A, SW480 cells were treated with
5 mmol/L aspirin for the times indicated in hours, and the
cellular distribution of RelA (FITC) was assessed by
immunocytochemical staining. Independent FITC and DAPI
channels. Magnification, 63. Bar, 10 Am. B, SW480 cells
were treated with 5 mmol/L aspirin for the times indicated and
the extent of NF-nB DNA binding was determined in nuclear
protein extracts by EMSA analysis. Cells treated with TNF-a
served as a positive control (+ve ), whereas the nuclear extract
was substituted with lysis buffer for the negative control ( ve ).
The specificity of DNA binding was determined by incubating
the positive control nuclear extract with a 100-fold excess of
either nonlabeled AP-1 or NF-nB, which functioned as a
noncompetitor (NC ) and cold competitor (CC ), respectively,
before the addition of radiolabeled NF-nB. C, a supershift
analysis was conducted by preincubating nuclear extracts from
untreated cells (C ) or cells exposed to 5 mmol/L aspirin for
16 h (A ) with antibodies directed against p50 or the COOH- or
NH2-terminal of RelA before running the EMSA as described
above. Antibodies against p50 and the NH2-terminal of RelA
decreased the mobility of the NF-nB complex through the gel,
whereas an antibody against the COOH-terminal of RelA
diminished NF-nB DNA-binding.

We examined the effects of PD169316 on aspirin-induced cell
cycle arrest and discovered that chemical inhibition of p38
substantially abrogated the S-phase accumulation that occurred
after aspirin treatment (Fig. 4B). We confirmed the specificity of
PD169316 using sequence-specific siRNA directed against p38.
Using Western blot analysis, we found that siRNA-mediated
knockdown of p38 reduced aspirin-induced degradation of cyclin
D1 (Fig. 4C). Immunocytochemistry also revealed that aspirinmediated cyclin D1 degradation was inhibited in cultures transfected with p38 siRNA, compared with cultures transfected with
scrambled siRNA (data not shown). To further show a critical role
for p38 in aspirin-induced cyclin D1 degradation, we used FLAGtagged vectors expressing either p38a WT protein or a mutated
form of p38a in which the dual TGY phosphorylation site has been
converted to AGF (p38a AF; ref. 21). Using immunocytochemistry,
we found that cyclin D1 protein was highly expressed in
nontransfected and p38a WT–transfected colon cancer cells before
aspirin treatment (Fig. 4D). Following exposure to aspirin, the
levels of cyclin D1 dramatically decreased in both p38a WT and
nontransfected cells. However, cyclin D1 degradation by aspirin
was attenuated in cancer cells transfected with the p38a AF vector
(Fig. 4D, bottom). These data show a causal relationship between
activation of the p38 signaling cascade and the reduction in cyclin
D1 protein levels that occur after aspirin treatment.
Next, we investigated the role of p38 in aspirin-mediated
activation of the NF-nB pathway and apoptosis. Using immunocytochemical analysis, we found that blocking p38 signaling using
PD169316 inhibited aspirin-induced nucleolar translocation of RelA

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 5A). We also found that transfection with p38 siRNA reduced
the level of p38 protein expression in f60% of cells (Fig. 5B,
magenta arrows), which is consistent with the level of knockdown
observed using Western blot analysis on whole-cell populations
(Fig. 4C). In cells where p38 expression was knocked down, we
found that RelA remained cytoplasmic in response to aspirin. In
contrast, aspirin stimulated cytoplasmic to nuclear/nucleolar
translocation of RelA in cells expressing normal levels of p38
(Fig. 5B, yellow arrows). Analysis of transfected cell cultures indicated that p38 siRNA reduced the proportion of cells containing
nucleolar RelA after aspirin treatment from 16% to 7% (in keeping
with the level of knockdown), whereas PD169316 decreased the
number from 13% to <1% (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, RelA remained
cytoplasmic after aspirin treatment in the presence of PD169316
and p38 siRNA, showing that p38 signaling is required to activate
the NF-nB pathway, leading to cytoplasmic-nuclear/nucleolar
translocation of RelA. In parallel with the effects on stimulation
of the NF-nB pathway and nucleolar translocation of RelA, we
found that p38 siRNA inhibited the apoptotic response to aspirin
(Fig. 5D). The discrepancy between the proportion of cells with
nucleolar RelA (16%) and the proportion undergoing apoptosis
(40%) is due to differences in assay protocols because both
adherent and floating cell populations are collected for apoptosis
assays, whereas only adherent cells are analyzed by immunocytochemistry. In addition, the effects of aspirin on nucleolar RelA
sequestration and apoptosis were attenuated by expression of the
catalytically inactive p38a AF mutant (data not shown). Taken
together, these data indicate that aspirin-induced activation of the

NF-nB pathway and apoptosis of colon cancer cells are also
dependent on p38 activity.
Inhibition of CDK4 mimics the effects of aspirin. Because the
data presented here show that aspirin rapidly activates the p38
MAPK cascade and that both cyclin D1 degradation/cell cycle
arrest and activation of the NF-nB pathway are dependent on this
effect, we wished to determine whether cyclin D1 degradation is
causally associated with activation of the NF-nB pathway.
To stimulate cell cycle progression, cyclin D1 is required to
interact with CDK4 and CDK6 to form an active kinase complex
(33). To investigate the role of cyclin D1 degradation/cell cycle
arrest in activation of the NF-nB pathway, we knocked out cyclin
D1 function in colorectal cancer cells using a specific inhibitor
of CDK4 (19). This CDK4 inhibitor blocks the activity of the cyclin
D1/CDK4 kinase complex and should therefore replicate the effects
of aspirin-mediated cyclin D1 degradation. Remarkably, we found
that mimicking a reduction in cyclin D1 levels with the CDK4
inhibitor induced nucleolar translocation of RelA (Fig. 6A). This
effect seemed to be specific to inactivation of the cyclin D1/CDK4
complex, as roscovitine, which inhibits CDK1, CDK2, and CDK5,
but not the cyclin D–type kinases CDK4 or CDK6, had no effect on
the cellular distribution of RelA (Fig. 6A). In addition to its effects
on nucleolar localization of RelA, inhibition of CDK4 also induced
degradation of InB and apoptosis in colon cancer cells in a similar

manner to aspirin (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, by using NF-nB reporter
assays, we found that the CDK4 inhibitor induced a decrease in
NF-nB–driven transcription (Fig. 6B), a response that is associated
with nucleolar translocation of RelA and apoptosis (9). These data
suggest that inactivation of cyclin D1/CDK4 does indeed activate
the NF-nB signaling cascade, resulting in nucleolar sequestration of
RelA and down-regulation of nB-driven transcription, which
ultimately leads to apoptosis.
We have previously shown that amino acids 27 to 30 in the NH2
terminal of RelA are required for nucleolar targeting of this protein
in response to aspirin and UV-C (9). To further investigate the
mechanism by which inhibition of CDK4 induces nucleolar
translocation of RelA, we used a mutant RelA protein that lacks
this critical nucleolar localization sequence. In keeping with our
immunocytochemistry data, we found that both aspirin and the
CDK4 inhibitor induced nucleolar translocation of GFP-tagged
RelA WT (Fig. 6C). However, when cells expressing the GFP-tagged
RelA nucleolar localization signal deletion mutant (RelA D27–30)
were exposed to either aspirin or the CDK4 inhibitor, RelA
migrated to the nucleus but was excluded from the nucleolus
(Fig. 6C, yellow arrows). Furthermore, apoptosis induced by both
aspirin and the CDK4 inhibitor was attenuated in cells expressing
RelA D27–30 (Fig. 6D). Collectively, these data suggest that aspirin
and the CDK4 inhibitor function through a common mechanism to
stimulate the NF-nB pathway to induce nucleolar sequestration
of RelA. These findings also confirm that inactivation of cyclin
D1/CDK4 is sufficient to drive the downstream responses, which,
through nucleolar targeting of RelA, lead to apoptosis of colon
cancer cells.

Discussion

cells were treated with 5 mmol/L aspirin for the times indicated in minutes (¶) or

The NF-nB transcription factor is one of the most important
regulators of the cellular life/death balance and its aberrant
activation is associated with cancer (4). Therefore, identifying
mechanisms for switching off aberrant NF-nB activity could have
a major therapeutic benefit. Here, we reveal a novel pathway for
down-regulating NF-nB transcriptional activity and inducing
apoptosis of colon cancer cells that involves activation of the p38
pathway, inhibition of the cyclin D1/CDK4 kinase complex, and
consequent nucleolar targeting of RelA. These findings contribute
to our knowledge of the complexities of NF-nB signaling. Furthermore, these findings have considerable relevance to understanding
the mechanisms of chemoprevention and cancer therapeutics.
The data presented here provide evidence that p38-mediated
inhibition of cyclin D1/CDK4 stimulates the NF-nB pathway to
induce nucleolar sequestration of RelA. This conclusion is based
on the following findings. First, p38 was rapidly activated in response to aspirin. Second, inhibiting p38 kinase activity by any
of three approaches—chemical inhibition with PD169316, downregulation of p38 protein with siRNA, or expression of a kinasedead p38 mutant—all attenuated aspirin-induced cyclin D1
degradation and cell cycle arrest. This strongly suggests that these
effects are mediated through the p38 pathway. Third, PD169316,
siRNA, and kinase-dead p38 prevented aspirin-induced stimulation
of cytoplasmic-nuclear/nucleolar translocation of RelA. These
studies show that p38 is important for both the degradation of
cyclin D1 and the NF-nB responses to aspirin, suggesting that these
pathways may be linked. Fourth, we found that inhibiting cyclin
D1/CDK4 kinase activity stimulated InB degradation, nucleolar
accumulation of RelA, repression of nB-driven transcription, and

Figure 4. Blocking p38 activity attenuates
aspirin effects on the cell cycle. A, SW480
cells were pretreated with 5 Amol/L
PD169316 or 10 Amol/L SB203580 for
1 h and then exposed to 5 mmol/L aspirin
for a further 60 min. The levels of p38
kinase activity were then determined using
kinase assays with ATF-2 as a substrate,
as described above. The levels of cyclin D1
protein were also examined by Western
blot analysis, with actin used to control for
protein loading. B, SW480 cells were
pretreated with 5 Amol/L PD169316 for
1 h before the addition of 5 mmol/L aspirin
for 16 h. The proportion of cells in each
phase of the cycle was determined, and the
levels after aspirin treatment were
expressed as a percentage of the levels
without aspirin. Columns, mean of three
experiments; bars, SE. Aspirin caused a
significant increase in the level of cells
in S-phase compared with control
(P = 0.022), whereas there was no
difference between control and
aspirin-treated cells in the presence of
PD169316. C, SW480 cells were
transfected with p38 siRNA or a scrambled
sequence for 48 h before the addition of
5 mmol/L aspirin for 1 h. The levels
of p38 and cyclin D1 protein were then
determined by Western blot analysis.
D, SW480 cells were transfected with
vectors encoding FLAG-tagged p38a WT
protein or a catalytically inactive p38a
mutant (p38a AF). The cells were then
exposed to 5 mmol/L aspirin for 4 h, and
the cellular distribution of cyclin D1 (FITC)
and FLAG-p38 (Texas red) was assessed
by immunocytochemical staining.

apoptosis, supporting our hypothesis that p38 mediates its effects
on the NF-nB pathway through inhibition of the cyclin D1/CDK4
complex. In further support of this notion, serum deprivation
(16, 24) and UV-C (15, 25), which stimulate the NF-nB pathway,
have also previously been shown to activate p38 signaling and
induce cell cycle arrest. We have previously shown that, in addition
to aspirin, each of these cellular insults cause nucleolar targeting
of RelA (9). Finally, our studies using the RelA nucleolar localization
signal deletion mutant showed that inactivation of cyclin D1/CDK4
causes nucleolar targeting of RelA and induces apoptosis through
the same molecular mechanism as aspirin. The novel observations
presented here are the first to show the MAPK cascade is involved
in NF-nB signaling in response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs and stimulation of the NF-nB pathway by a CDK4 inhibitor.
Although several studies have shown enhanced phosphorylation
of p38 after salicylate treatment (34–36), this study is the first to
show that aspirin activates MKK3/MKK6, the kinases upstream of

p38. Our study also indicates that the aspirin-induced degradation
of cyclin D1 is p38 dependent. Because p38 has been previously
shown to directly phosphorylate cyclin D1 in response to osmotic
stress (22), targeting the protein for degradation, we propose that
p38 targets cyclin D1 directly in response to aspirin. Studies are
ongoing in our laboratory to identify the targets upstream of
MKK3/MKK6 that could be triggered by aspirin, for example, ASK1
(37), cdc42 (38), and cell surface integrins (39, 40), and to determine
whether p38 directly phosphorylates cyclin D1.
Our finding that cyclin D1 degradation was associated with arrest
in the S and G2-M phases of the cell cycle would seem to contradict the established understanding that cyclin D1 is a mediator of
G1-S phase transition and that inhibition causes arrest in G1. However, more recently, cyclin D1 has been shown to be required at
later stages of the cell cycle (41). Furthermore, other chemopreventative agents have been shown to induce S-phase arrest associated with degradation of cyclin D1 (42, 43). Interestingly, we were

unable to detect nucleolar sequestration of RelA in cells arrested
using specific inhibitors of the G2-M phase (nocodazole or colcemid)
or synchronized in S-phase after release from aphidicolin treatment
(data not shown). This would suggest that specific inhibition of
cyclin D1/CDK4 is required to induce nucleolar RelA translocation,
as opposed to cell cycle arrest per se. This finding also implies that
the cell cycle arrest we detect after aspirin treatment occurs as a consequence of down-regulation of cyclin D1/CDK4, but is not sufficient itself to drive the effects we observed on the NF-nB pathway.
Interestingly, we found that deletion of the nucleolar localization signal from RelA permitted nuclear translocation of the pro-

tein but prevented nucleolar accumulation of RelA after treatment
with either aspirin or the CDK4 inhibitor. These data confirm that
inhibition of cyclin D1/CDK4 stimulates the NF-nB pathway in
the cytoplasm to induce cytoplasmic-nuclear/nucleolar translocation of RelA, but suggest that additional events requiring the
nucleolar localization signal are needed for nucleolar targeting of
the protein. It is possible that aspirin-induced inactivation of cyclin
D1/CDK4 stimulates the NF-nB pathway in a manner that leads
to the interaction of RelA with one or more cofactors, which either
bind directly to the nucleolar localization signal or require an
intact nucleolar localization signal to stabilize the protein-protein

p38, CDK4 Inhibition, and RelA Nucleolar Translocation

Figure 6. Inhibition of CDK4 mimics the effects of aspirin. A, SW480 cells were exposed to 5 mmol/L aspirin, 2 Amol/L of a commercially available CDK4 inhibitor
(CDK4i ), or 10 Amol/L of the CDK1, CDK2, and CDK5 inhibitor, roscovitine, for 16 h. The cellular distribution of RelA (FITC) and the nucleolar marker fibrillarin
(Texas red) was assessed by immunocytochemical staining. The merged panel is a pseudocolor image generated by combining the FITC (green ), Texas red (red ),
and DAPI (blue ) channels. Bar , 10 Am. B, cells were treated with 5 mmol/L aspirin or 2 Amol/L of the CDK4 inhibitor for 16 h. The levels of InB protein were determined
by Western blot analysis; actin was used to control for protein loading. The percentage of apoptosis (Annexin V–positive cells) was determined by fluorescence
microscopy (closed columns ). Columns, mean of three experiments; bars, SE. Both aspirin and the CDK4 inhibitor significantly increased the proportion of apoptotic
cells, compared with the control (P = 0.046 and P = 0.015, respectively). Cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid containing a luciferase gene under the
control of an NF-nB–driven promoter before treatment as described above. The extent of NF-nB–driven transcription was then assessed after treatment, and the levels
of gene expression were calculated as a percentage of the control value (open columns ). Columns, mean of four experiments; bars, SE. C, SW480 cells were
transfected with a GFP-tagged construct encoding either RelA WT or a mutant RelA protein in which the nucleolar localization signal had been deleted (RelA D27–30).
The cells were then exposed to either 5 mmol/L aspirin or 2 Amol/L of the CDK4 inhibitor for 16 h. The cellular distribution of the GFP-tagged proteins was then
visualized using live cell imaging to obtain fluorescent and phase-contrast images of the cells with a 40 objective lens. Bar, 10 Am. Each channel was recorded
independently, and pseudocolor images were superimposed. Yellow arrows, where RelA is excluded from the nucleolus. D, cells were transfected and treated as

increased the proportion of apoptotic RelA WT cells compared with the control (P = 0.024 and P = 0.025, respectively), whereas there was no significant
difference between control and treated RelA D27–30 cells (P = 0.169 for aspirin and P = 0.193 for the CDK4 inhibitor).

interaction. We propose a model whereby the interaction between
RelA and this cofactor(s) diverts the NF-nB complex away from its
gene targets in the nucleoplasm and into the nucleolus, leading to
repression of transcription and apoptosis. An alternative hypothesis, however, is that the interaction of RelA with the cofactor(s)
forms a transcriptionally repressive complex, which down-regulates
gene expression and then induces nucleolar sequestration of the
proteins, possibly as a means to limit their effects. This latter
theory is supported by previous studies (11) showing that RelA can
interact with histone deacetylases after exposure to UV-C to form
a transcriptionally repressive complex. Studies to identify this
cofactor(s), which is activated/recruited after inactivation of cyclin
D1/CDK4, are ongoing within our laboratory.
Our data showing that a CDK4 inhibitor mimics the effects of
aspirin on the NF-nB pathway are particularly exciting given the
current interest in cell cycle inhibitors as anticancer agents. There
are several possible pathways by which inhibition of cyclin D1/
CDK4 could activate the NF-nB signaling cascade to bring about
nucleolar sequestration of RelA. For example, previous studies have
shown that inhibition of cyclin D1/CDK4 activity leads to hypophosphorylation of Rb protein and consequently down-regulation
of E2F activity (33). As E2F is known to stabilize the NF-nB
inhibitor InB (44), attenuation of E2F activity would lead to destabilization of InB and subsequent activation of NF-nB. Our current
findings support this suggestion because chemical inhibition of
CDK4 activity induced degradation of InB (Fig. 6B). In addition,
recent studies have shown that CDK4 can interact directly with
InB, suggesting another point of cross-talk between these path-

ways that could be involved in activation of NF-nB (45). Studies
to investigate these hypotheses are currently under way in our
laboratory.
The data presented here provide compelling evidence that
aspirin induces apoptosis via effects on the p38 MAPK, cyclin D1/
CDK4, and NF-nB pathways. Furthermore, the findings identify a
novel effect of CDK4 inhibitors that is highly relevant to the
antitumor effects of these agents. These studies contribute to
understanding of the complex intracellular signaling cascades that
control apoptosis through NF-nB and reveal novel pathways to
down-regulate NF-nB transcriptional activity. Such understanding
could be exploited to promote the development of chemotherapeutic/chemopreventative agents.
