Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We report that knocking down the expression of inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II
(INPP4B) in human epithelial cells, like knockdown of PTEN, resulted in enhanced Akt activation,
anchorage-independent growth, and enhanced over all motility. In xenograft experiments
overexpression of INPP4B resulted in reduced tumor growth. INPP4B preferentially hydrolyzes
phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) with no effect on phosphatidylinositol-3.4.5triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), suggesting that PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 may cooperate in Akt activation
and cell transformation. Dual knockdown of INPP4B and PTEN resulted in cellular senescence.
Finally, we find loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) at the INPP4B locus in a majority of basal-like breast
cancers as well as in a significant fraction of ovarian cancers, which correlated with lower over all
patient survival, suggesting that INPP4B is a tumor suppressor.

Introduction
During the generation and progression of epithelial tumors, oncogenes and tumor suppressor
genes cause multiple cell-autonomous alterations resulting in aberrant control of proliferation,
apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cellular life span (Hahn and Weinberg, 2002). The cyclic
regulation of the mammary gland confers vulnerability to these cancer-promoting processes,
and imbalances between proliferation and apoptosis sets the scene for mammary tumorigenesis
(Scheid and Woodgett, 2001). The phosphinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway is
deregulated in a wide spectrum of human cancers, and gain or loss-of-function mutations of
several components of the pathway lead to neoplastic transformation in various model systems
(Engelman et al., 2006; Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002).

In vivo activation of PI3K increases the intracellular amounts of phosphatidylinositol(3,4)
bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5) trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). A
variety of signaling proteins, including the Ser/Thr kinases Akt and PDK1 are able to bind to
one or both of these PI3K lipid products and are thereby localized to the plasma membrane to
initiate cell growth and cell survival pathways. (Plas and Thompson, 2005; Manning and
Cantley, 2007).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The termination of signaling downstream of PI3K by degradation of PI(3,4,5)P3 can be
mediated by two different types of phosphatases. PTEN dephosphorylates the 3-position of PI
(3,4,5)P3 to produce PI(4,5)P2, while SHIP family phosphatases dephosphorylate the 5position to produce PI(3,4)P2 (Figure 1). Loss of PTEN protein expression or function is
frequently observed in human cancers (Vazquez and Sellers, 2000), and deletion of PTEN in
mice results in a variety of tumors (Di Cristofano et al., 1998; Kishimoto et al., 2003), indicating
that uncontrolled signaling through PI3K contributes to cancer formation and metastasis. In
contrast, loss of genes for SHIP family members has not correlated with solid tumor formation,
thus the role of these phosphatases in regulating PI3K signaling is complex and controversial.
Some studies have indicated that SHIP family members suppress PI3K signaling (Scheid et
al., 2002;Sharrard and Maitland, 2007;Sleeman et al., 2005), while other studies suggest that
the product of SHIP family members, PI(3,4)P2, is a positive regulator of Akt (Franke et al.,
1997;Frech et al., 1997;Klippel et al., 1997;Scheid et al., 2002). The PH-domains of Akt and
PDK1 bind both PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 in vitro, suggesting these lipids may be redundant
in their ability to mediate Akt activation (Cantley, 2002). The possibility that both PI(3,4,5)
P3 and PI(3,4)P2 may be necessary for optimal growth signaling downstream of PI3K has not
been adequately addressed.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) was initially isolated from rat brain
as an enzyme that hydrolyzes the 4-position phosphate of PI(3,4)P2, and to a lesser degree
inositol(3,4)bisphosphate (Ins((3,4)P2) and Ins(3,4,5)P3, in vitro (Norris et al., 1997; Norris et
al., 1995). The ability of INPP4B to hydrolyze PI(3,4,5)P3 and its effects on phosphoinositides
in intact cells was not investigated, thus, the in vivo function of INPP4B remains elusive.
However, INPP4B expression was recently shown to be silenced in malignant proerythroblasts.
These cells displayed increased phospho-Akt levels, which could be reduced by re-expression
of INPP4B (Barnache et al., 2005). In addition, recent studies described a frequently deleted
region in breast cancer cell lines and basal-like, high grade breast tumors using high-resolution
comparative genomic hybridization analysis (chromosome location 4q31.1-31.21 and
chromosome location 4q31.3-q32.1, respectively) comprising 6 genes, including INPP4B
(Naylor et al., 2005; Bergamaschi et al., 2006; Chin et al., 2007). Johannsdottir et al. also found
LOH in this region in breast cancers (Johannsdottir et al., 2004). Further, INPP4B was
identified out of a collection of RNAis to give rise to anchorage-independent growth in human
mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) (Westbrook et al., 2005).
These observations raise the possibility that INPP4B might be affecting PI3K signaling in
vivo and that it might function as a tumor suppressor. In this study we investigate this possibility
with retroviral knockdown of INPP4B in human epithelial cell systems.

Results
Knockdown of INPP4B results in anchorage-independent growth
To investigate the role of INPP4B on cell transformation in the human mammary epithelial
cell line HMEC, retroviral hairpin constructs (shRNA) were used to knockdown its expression.
An shRNA construct directed against Renilla luciferase (shRNA-Renilla) was used as negative
control for the experiments. Two shRNA constructs (shRNA-INPP4B-1 and shRNAINPP4B-2) were found to effectively reduce expression of INPP4B in several cell lines as

judged by decreased mRNA levels (figure 2A). In MCF-7 cells, where INPP4B protein levels
were high enough to be detected by Western Blotting, these constructs were shown to reduce
INPP4B protein to the same extend (figure 2B). Infection of HMEC cells with either shRNAINPP4B-1 or shRNA-INPP4B-2 resulted in anchorage-independent growth comparable to that
observed with an shRNA directed against PTEN (figure 2C and 2D). Knocking down INPP4B
or PTEN also increased the rate of proliferation of HMEC cells and the effect of knocking
down INPP4B could be reversed by expression of a knockdown resistant INPP4B, indicating
that the shRNA was acting on target (figure 2E).
INPP4B knockdown results in increased migratory and invasive behavior of human
mammary epithelial cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Migration and invasion are hallmarks of tumor cells with the potential to metastasize to new
locations in the body. To analyze the migratory behavior of human mammary epithelial cells,
HMEC cells expressing the various shRNA constructs were grown until confluency and a
scratch wound was introduced with a pipette tip. Pictures were taken at time points t = 0 hours
and t = 8 hours as indicated (figure 3A). Cells expressing shRNA directed against PTEN and
INPP4B closed the wound more rapidly than control cells (figure 3A; quantified in figure 3B).
The increased rate of wound closure due to INPP4B knockdown was partially rescued by
expressing a wild type INPP4B construct that circumvents the knockdown (‘INPP4BR’), but
was not affected by expressing the catalytically inactive mutant of INPP4B (‘INPP4B-CD’)
(figure 3C – expression of INPP4BR and INPP4B-CD is presented in supplemental figure 1).
The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 also reduced the rate of wound closure in PTEN and INPP4B
knockdown cell pools significantly, consistent with the idea that increased cell migration was
due to elevated PI(3,4)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3 levels for INPP4B or PTEN knockdown, repectively
(figure 3D).
We also investigated the effect of knocking down INPP4B on the ability of MCF-10A cells to
intravasate through a Matrigel layer in a Boyden chamber revealing the invasive nature of
shRNA knockdown cell pools. As shown in figure 3E, knocking down INPP4B had a greater
effect on promoting migration through Matrigel than knocking down PTEN.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to the enhanced migratory behavior, INPP4B knockdown cells displayed a spindlelike and fibroblastic morphology compared to Renilla or PTEN knockdown controls
(supplemental figure 2A), suggestive of an epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT)
(Lee et al., 2006). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR of selected epithelial and mesenchymal marker
genes revealed a large increase in N-Cadherin, a decrease in gamma-Catenin, and a subtle
decrease in E-Cadherin RNA-levels in INPP4B knockdown cell pools compared to Renilla
control cell pools (supplemental figure 2B). Further, we observed a strong increase in the
fibroblast marker fibronectin compared to the Renilla knockdown control. These changes were
consistent with a more mesenchymal phenotype. In contrast, RNA levels of EMT markers in
PTEN knockdown cell pools revealed a significant decrease in N-Cadherin and a strong
increase in vimentin levels, but increased E-Cadherin levels and little fibronectin expression
(supplemental figure 2C).
INPP4B knockdown in MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells results in distorted acini
architecture in three-dimensional culture
Using the MCF-10A three-dimensional culture model of mammary epithelial cells, we
examined how knockdown of INPP4B influenced the morphogenesis of polarized epithelial
structures. Knockdown of INPP4B, or PTEN in MCF-10A cells resulted in enhanced and
dysmorphic growth of acini in three-dimensional cultures (figure 4A, left panels). In parallel,
cells were treated with the mTORC1 inhibitor Rapamycin, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or
with the MEK inhibitor UO126 starting day 1 of culture (figure 4A, middle and right panels).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Rapamycin had only a minor effect on dysmorphic growth of INPP4B knockdown acini in
three-dimensional assays, and did not have any impact on PTEN knockdown cell pools.
LY294002 and UO126 treatment caused a general growth delay of acini formation resulting
in smaller spheres compared to untreated cell pools. In INPP4B and PTEN knockdown cell
pools, UO126 treatment only delayed the onset of architecturally disturbed acini growth, but
LY294002 treatment resulted in almost normal appearance of spheres comparable to Renilla
knockdown controls. These data suggest that signals downstream of PI3K/Akt are important
for the disturbed architectural growth of INPP4B knockdown spheres.
Overexpression of INPP4B in SUM149 cells reduced tumor growth in a xenograft mouse
model
The human invasive ductal carcinoma cell line SUM149 was infected with a retroviral vector
expressing Flag-INPP4B or Flag-tag, only and the resultant cells were subcutaneously injected
into nude mice. The SUM149 cells expressing empty Flag-vector produced much larger tumors
as compared to cells expressing Flag-INPP4B (figure 4B, quantified in figure 4C). The total
level of INPP4B was approximately 2 to 3 fold higher in the SUM149 cells expressing FlagINPP4B compared to levels in control SUM149 cells (figure 4D). These data indicate that
overexpression of INPP4B in the human mammary tumor cell line SUM149 suppresses tumor
growth in a xenograft mouse model.

Effect of INPP4B on cellular phosphoinositides
Previous studies have indicated that INPP4B hydrolyzes PI(3,4)P2, however PI(3,4,5)P3
hydrolysis was not examined and the effect of INPP4B on cellular phosphoinositides was not
investigated (Norris et al., 1995). In Figure 5A we show that INPP4B prefers PI(3,4)P2 over
PI(3,4,5)P3 in in vitro assays. To verify that PI(3,4)P2 is also an in vivo substrate of INPP4B
we overexpressed the enzyme in 3T3-L6 myoblast cells, a cell line that produces easily
detectable levels of PI(3)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 (Mandl et al., 2007). The
cellular level of PI(3,4)P2 in INPP4B expressing cells was reduced significantly. In contrast,
the levels of the other lipids, including PI(3,4,5)P3, were not affected (figure 5B). Although
one might expect an increase in PI(3)P due to hydrolysis of the 4-position of PI(3,4)P2, PI(3)
P is at much higher levels than PI(3,4)P2 and most of this lipid is probably produced by class
III PI3K, rather than through hydrolysis of PI(3,4)P2. These findings indicate that the effects
of INPP4B knockdown in the mammary epithelial cell system are due to elevated PI(3,4)P2
levels alone, rather than elevated PI(3,4,5)P3 levels, as is the case for PTEN knockdown.
Knockdown of both INPP4B and PTEN leads to cellular senescence

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to address whether INPP4B and PTEN have redundant functions, HMEC cells were
subjected to dual knockdown of INPP4B and PTEN. Unexpectedly, knocking down INPP4B
and PTEN simultaneously resulted in decreased cell proliferation compared to Renilla
knockdown control (figure 6A), and resulted in fewer anchorage-independent colonies
compared to INPP4B or PTEN single knockdown cell pools (figure 6B and 6C). However, the
few colonies that formed from the double knockdown cells were larger than those formed from
cells with single knockdown of INPP4B or PTEN (figure 6B). These results indicate that loss
of both INPP4B and PTEN results in impaired cell growth but that rare events (genetic or
epigenetic) occur in the double knockdown cells that allow enhanced growth compared to
knockdown of either INPP4B or PTEN alone.
Since mutations in K-ras, B-raf, PTEN and NF-1 have been shown to trigger cellular senescence
in vivo (Chen et al., 2005; Collado et al., 2005)(Braig et al., 2005; Courtois-Cox et al., 2006;
Dankort et al., 2007), we investigated the effect of knocking down PTEN or INPP4B on
senescence of HMEC cells. In Figure 6D, we show that knocking down expression of PTEN
or INPP4B leads to increased cellular senescence, while knocking down both INPP4B and

PTEN results in a dramatic increase in cellular senescence. Ras- or PTEN-induced senescence
can be bypassed by inactivating the Rb and transformation related protein 53 (Trp53) pathways.
Cell senescence in INPP4B knockdown cell pools, as well as in INPP4B and PTEN dual
knockdown cell pools could be rescued by knocking down Trp53 using a retroviral hairpin
construct (figure 6D). The effect of the shRNAs against INPP4B, PTEN and Trp53 on protein
levels is presented in figure 6E. Representative pictures of HMEC knockdown cell pools
stained for the senescence marker SA-beta-Gal are shown in supplemental figure 3.
INPP4B knockdown affects the PI3-kinase/Akt signal transduction pathway
Time course experiments were performed to compare the effects of INPP4B knockdown versus
PTEN knockdown on Akt signaling. Knocking down INPP4B or PTEN in HMEC cells had
little effect on basal Akt activation (as judged by phosphorylation at Thr-308 or Ser-473) but
had a significant effect on the magnitude and duration of insulin-stimulated Akt activation (Fig.
7A and B). This was also reflected in an increase in phosphorylation of Tuberin and GSK3beta
at sites known to be dependent on AKT (supplemental figure S4). Expression of a form of
INPP4B that circumvents knockdown (INPP4BR) suppressed AKT activation. Dual
knockdown of INPP4B and PTEN in HMEC cells caused a more prolonged phosphorylation
of AKT at Thr308 than that caused by knocking down either protein alone (supplemental figure
5).

Loss of heterozygosity of INPP4B in BRCA1-mutant and basal-like breast tumors
To detect potential genomic alterations of INPP4B in breast cancer, we analyzed a 10K SNP
array set of 43 previously published breast cancers (Richardson et al., 2006). Comparison of
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns in the major subtypes of high grade breast cancer
revealed that allelic loss at 4q31.21 was predominantly seen in the sporadic triple-negative
(basal-like) tumors and in tumors arising in patients carrying a BRCA1 germline mutation.
Figure 8A presents frequency of allelic loss in percent at chromosome position 4q31.21 for
each tumor group. LOH in region 4q31.21 occurred in 60%, 55.6%, and 5% of BRCA1-mutant,
sporadic basal-like, and high grade non-basal-like tumors, respectively (p<0.001). INPP4B
mRNA expression level determined using two different array probes for INPP4B revealed
lower relative expression (progressively darker shades of blue color) in BRCA1-mutant (B1)
and sporadic basal-like breast tumors compared to other high-grade breast tumors (figure 8B).
The triple negative or basal-like tumor subtype in which LOH and decreased expression of
INPP4B was observed, is frequently a tumor subtype noted for increased metastatic potential
and poor patient outcome (Sorlie et al., 2001)(Kapp et al., 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Probing a different cohort of breast cancer patient tissues comprising mostly subclasses other
than BRCA1-mutant and basal-like with an antibody directed against INPP4B, we found
significant correlation between loss of INPP4B protein expression and decreased over all
patient survival (figure 8C, patient information is summarized in Table S1, examples of scoring
patient tissue for INPP4B expression levels by immunohistochemistry is shown in
supplemental figure S6). Breast cancer patient tissues were also stained for progesterone
receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), and Heregulin2 (Her2)/NEU expression levels in order
to indicate hormone dependence of breast tumor tissue (supplemental table 1). These data
suggest that loss of INPP4B expression in breast tumor tissues is associated with poor patient
outcome.
LOH of INPP4B correlates with decreased survival in ovarian cancer
LOH at 4q31.1-3, the region that includes INPP4B and other genes, has previously been
observed in esophageal cancers (Sterian et al., 2006) prompting us to investigate chromosomal
locus 4q31.1-3 in a variety of solid cancers. It was found high rates of copy number deletions
at 4q31.1-3 in ovarian cancers (39.8%) and melanomas (21.6%) (Supplemental table 2). Copy

number loss of INPP4B on chromosomal locus 4q31.1-3 was not observed as focal deletion
but involving various genes in addition to INPP4B. Based on these findings, we investigated
levels of INPP4B expression in randomly chosen ovarian cancers using IHC and found that,
as in breast cancers, low levels of INPP4B correlated with decreased patient survival (Fig. 8D).
Also, we found an inverse correlation between INPP4B expression levels and lymph node
involvement (Fig. 8E, patient information is summarized in Table S3). Further, copy number
analysis of a previously described ovarian tumor cohort revealed that out of 118 ovarian tumors
investigated, 37 showed deletion at the INPP4B locus only, 8 tumors showed deletion at the
PTEN locus only, and 10 tumors showed deletion at both the INPP4B locus and PTEN locus
(n=118, supplemental figure 7A) (Dariush Etemadmoghadam et al., 2009). Since we found
high cellular senescence upon loss of both, INPP4B and PTEN, unless Trp53 was also knocked
down, we further investigated whether tumors with deletion of either lipid phosphatase
(INPP4B or PTEN) or both showed Trp53 mutations. Re-analysis of the described ovarian
cohort showed that most tumors harbored mutations in Trp53 whether or not INPP4B or PTEN
were deleted (supplemental figure 7B), consistent with previous studies indicating high rates
of Trp53 mutations in this disease (Krypuy et al., 2007).

Discussion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here we present evidence that INPP4B functions as a tumor suppressor. Knocking down the
expression of this enzyme in HMEC cells results in anchorage-independent growth and
enhanced motility, similar to changes induced in response to knockdown of the PTEN tumor
suppressor gene. Knocking down INPP4B in the human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10A,
resulted in dysmorphic growth of acinar structures in three dimensional Matrigel cultures, and
increased intravasation of Matrigel in a Boyden chamber assay. These results were also similar
to those observed upon knocking down PTEN. Knockdown of INPP4B and knockdown of
PTEN both enhanced and prolonged AKT activation in HMEC cells in response to insulin,
indicating that these two phosphoinositide phosphatases have similar effects on signaling
downstream of PI3K and that they may play similar roles as tumor suppressors.

However, there were also some differences in cellular responses to knocking down INPP4B
versus PTEN. Knocking down INPP4B in HMEC cells resulted in a more spindle-like cell
structure compared to control cells or cells in which PTEN was knocked down. In addition,
while the HMEC cells in which INPP4B was knocked down had enhanced N-cadherin and
fibronectin expression, the HMEC cells in which PTEN was knocked down showed decreases
in N-cadherin and fibronectin but increases in vimentin and E-cadherin. The MCF-10A cells
with INPP4B knockdown also showed a greater ability to invade a Matrigel barrier compared
to cells with PTEN knockdown. The similarities and differences observed between loss of
PTEN and loss of INPP4B can probably be explained by the different substrate specificities
of these two phosphatases. PTEN preferentially dephosphorylates the D-3 position of PI(3,4,5)
P3 while here we show that INPP4B preferentially dephosphorylates the D-4 position of PI
(3,4)P2 both in vitro and in vivo. While PI(3,4,5)P3 (produced by Class IA PI3Ks) is strongly
implicated in cell transformation and in activation of AKT, the in vivo function of PI(3,4)P2 is
not yet clear (Figure 1). This lipid can be produced by both class I and II PI3Ks in vitro using
PI(4)P as a substrate. It can also be produced in vitro by SHIP family phosphatases using PI
(3,4,5)P3 as a substrate. The major pathway for producing PI(3,4)P2 in vivo is not yet clear and
may vary from tissue to tissue. But we clearly show that the main substrate of INPP4B is PI
(3,4)P2, while PI(3,4,5)P3 is not affected. Interestingly, while some pleckstrin homology (PH)
domains, such as those on BTK and Grp1, bind only to PI(3,4,5)P3, other PH domains, such
as those on AKT and PDK1, can bind to both PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2. Yet other PH domains,
such as TAPP1 bind only to PI(3,4)P2. Despite apparently redundant abilities of PI(3,4)P2 and
PI(3,4,5)P3 to bind to both AKT and PDK1 PH domains and to facilitate PDK1 phosphorylation
of AKT in vitro, most in vivo studies have suggested that PI(3,4,5)P3 is more important than

PI(3,4)P2 for Akt activation. For example, deletion of SHIP1, a phosphatase that converts PI
(3,4,5)P3 to PI(3,4)P2, generally results in enhanced signaling downstream of PI3K and SHIP1
appears to be a tumor suppressor in hematopoietic cells (Gilby et al., 2007;Ong et al., 2007).
Yet one study suggested that PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 are both needed for full activation of
AKT (Scheid et al., 2002). It is also possible that, although PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 are
redundant for activation of AKT in vivo in some tissues, INPP4B (or related family members)
prevents PI(3,4)P2 from achieving the threshold necessary to activate Akt. In any event, our
results indicate that knocking down INPP4B results in an increase in sustained AKT activation
and cell transformation, similar to that observed upon knocking down PTEN.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Knocking down both INPP4B and PTEN in mammary epithelial cells resulted in cellular
senescence. Previous studies had shown that complete loss of PTEN drives cells into
senescence in vivo (Chen et al., 2005). Our findings that knocking down both INPP4B and
PTEN causes a synergistic increase in senescence compared to knockdown of either message
alone is consistent with the idea that superactivation of the PI3K pathway can result in
senescence (Nogueira et al., 2008). Consistent with previous studies, senescence could be
circumvented by knocking down Trp53. These results suggest that while loss of function of
one allele of INPP4B or PTEN will contribute to tumor formation, loss of function of both
alleles of INPP4B or PTEN (or of both) would be selected against in epithelial tumors. This
may explain why we have not detected point mutations in INPP4B in basal-like breast cancers
(Alexander Miron, unpublished data). Recently LOH of PTEN was detected in a significant
fraction of basal-like breast cancer, while point mutations in PTEN were not found (Saal et al.,
2008). This is presumably due to defects in DNA repair causing chromosomal rearrangements
and microcopy number aberrations. The failure to see point mutations in the remaining allele
is consistent with the idea that complete loss of PTEN results in senescence unless Trp53 is
mutated.
Finally, our results indicate that decreased expression of INPP4B correlates with poor outcome
in both breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients. Our results indicate that the PI3K pathway
is likely to play a major role in driving this subset of cancers. A number of PI3K inhibitors are
now in clinical trials and loss of INPP4B expression may provide a marker for selecting patients
who will respond to these drugs.

HMECs expressing hTERT and SV40 LT (TLM-HMECs) were cultured in mammary
epithelial growth medium (MEGM, Cambrex) (Zhao et al., 2003). MCF-10A cells were
maintained as described (Debnath et al., 2003). 293T and 3T3-L6 cells were grown in DMEM
with 10% bovine serum. SUM149PT cell line was provided by S. Ethier and grown as described
(http://www.asterand.com/Asterand/human_tissues/149PT.htm). Stable cell lines were
generated by transduction with the indicated retroviral supernatants in the presence of 10 μg/
ml polybrene, transduced cells were selected for resistance with puromycin (2 μg/ml) or
neomycine (250 μg/ml). Anchorage independent proliferation assays were performed as
described (Zhao et al., 2003), except cells were suspended in a top layer of 2% low-melting
agarose (Seakem) in MEGM. For growth curves, cells were seeded at a densitiy of 1.0 × 104
per well in 6-well plates and cultured in MEGM. Cells were trypsinized and counted at day 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Insulin stimulation experiments were performed with 100nM after overnight
serum starvation. Used inhibitors concentrations: Wortmannin 50 nM, LY294002 10 μM,
Rapamycin 1 nM, UO126 10 μM.

Retroviral vectors and virus production

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The shRNA hairpin-expressing retroviral vector MSCV-U6miR30-PIGdeltaRI, MSCVU6miR30-PIGdeltaRI-FF2 (Renilla), and MSCV-U6miR30-PIGdeltaRI-PTEN were a
generous gift from Steven Elledge (Harvard University, Boston, MA). Specific shRNAhairpins directed against human INPP4B-1 (RHS1764-9399376) and INPP4B-2
(RHS1764-9207446) were obtained from OpenBiosystems. Retroviral vector pLXSN was a
kind gift from Christopher Carpenter lab (Harvard University, Boston, MA). VSVpseudotyped retroviruses were produced as previously described (Ory et al., 1996). Specific
hairpin directed against human p53 was obtained from Addgene plasmid 10672, and specific
hairpin directed against PTEN (hygromycin-resistant) was described in Mandl et al. (Mandl et
al., 2007). Human INPP4B originated from the Origin cDNA expression library and was a kind
gift of Robin Ketteler (Harvard University, Boston, MA). The rescue construct pLXSN/FlagINPP4BR harbors two silent mutations at Ser687 to render it resistant to shRNA-INPP4B-1
knockdown. The catalytic-dead pLXSN/Flag-INPP4BR (‘INPP4BR-CD’) construct harbors a
Cys842Ala mutation to abolish phosphatase activity as well as two silent mutations at Ser687
to avoid knockdown.

Morphogenesis assays
The 3D culture of MCF-10A cells was performed as previously described (Debnath et al.,
2003). Used inhibitor concentrations: Rapamycin (1mM stock), (100mg/ml), UO126 (10mM).
The assay media DMEM/F12 supplemented with 3% donor horse serum, 5ng/ml EGF 10 μg/
ml insulin, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone and 2% Matrigel) was replaced
with media starting on day 1 and re-fed every 4 days thereafter. Where indicated UO126,
Rapamycin, or LY294002 were added to cultures at the reported dose on day 1 of 3D culture
and replaced every 4 days thereafter. Acini formation was documented with phase contrast
pictures.

Matrigel Invasion Assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Invasion assays were carried out as previously described using Transwell chambers (Corning)
with 8μm pore membranes coated with Matrigel. Cells were seeded at a density of 1×104 cells/
well in triplicates and allowed to invade through the Matrigel for 24 hours. Growth medium
was applied to both sides. Cells that had invaded to the lower surface of the membrane were
fixed and stained with TolueneO blue.
SA-beta-Gal Activitiy Assay
SA-beta-Gal staining was performed as described (Dimri et al., 1995), and percentages were
assessed by counting at least 300 cells. Cell pools were infected with shRNA-Trp53 and
analyzed 3 days later. Cells were stained for 8 hours before evaluation.
In vitro phosphatase assays and in vivo analysis of phosphoinositides

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

[32P]-PI(3)P, [32P]-PI(3,4)P2 and [32P]-PI(3,4,5)P3 were synthesized by incubating PI, PI(4)
P, and PI(4,5)P2 with class Ia PI3K (immunoprecipitated from 293T cells) and γ-[32P]-ATP
(Whitman et al., 1987), Each of the radio-labeled lipids was incubated for 3 hrs at 30° with
either INPP4B (Flag-immunoprecipitate from 293T cells expressing Flag-INPP4B) or with a
control Flag-immunoprecipitate. The lipids were extracted in chloroform/HCl and separated
by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The substrates and products from each phosphatase assay
were quantified by Phosphoimager and the per cent hydrolysis was calculated. Quantitative
HPLC analysis of deacetylated phosphoinositides from [32P]-inorganic phosphate-labeled L6
cells was performed as previously described (Auger et al., 1989). Counts for each single
phosphatidylinositol lipid were normalized to combined counts of the major phosphoinositides,
PI(4)P, and PI(4,5)P2.
Immunohistochemistry
The study cohort comprised breast and ovarian tumors consecutively ascertained at the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). All biopsies were evaluated at MSKCC,
and the histologic diagnosis was based on established standard criteria. Use of tissues were
approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) waivers and the Human Biospecimen
Utilization Committee (HBUC). TMAs were stained with INPP4B (goat polyclonal, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA Cat No. sc-12318 at 1:150 dilution) and PTEN
(mouse monoclonal, clone 6H2.1, Cascade Bioscience Inc, Winchester, MA at 1:75 dilution)
were applied after pre-treatment with 10mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 and microwave. Secondary
antibody biotinylated anti-goat made in rabbit (1:500) and ABC (avidin-biotin conjugate) Elite
Vectastain (1:25) (Vector Lab, Burlingame, CA) were applied. PTEN was stained and scored
as previously published (Min Sup et al., 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Copy number deletion analysis
Copy number loss of INPP4B in tumor tissues were analyzed as described in Lin et al.,
2008). Analysis of ovarian tumor tissue for loss of INPP4B and PTEN expression was
performed as described (Dariush Etemadmoghadam et al., 2009). Study population consisted
of 118 patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
The Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS) was performed by the Westmead Hospital
(n=73, Sidney, Australia). Other samples originated from Haukeland University Hospital of
Bergen (Bergen, Norway), and Jikei University (Tokyo, Japan). This project had institutional
ethics review board approval at all participating centers. AOCS samples subset was further
analyzed for Trp53 mutation as previously described (Krypuy et al., 2007).

Xenograft experiments

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

SUM149PT cells infected with pLXSN-Flag, empty or pLXSN-Flag-INPP4B were selected
for 2 weeks. Male nude mice were injected with 1×106 cells resuspended in 100μl Matrigel at
the right flank. Tumors were grown over a time period of 4 weeks and mice subsequently
sacrificed. Tumor occurrence and size were evaluated. All animal procedures followed
protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center at Harvard Medical School.
Significance
Loss of function mutations or deletions of PTEN and activating mutations or amplifications
of PIK3CA are amongst the most common events in solid tumors. Here we show that the
phosphoinositide phosphatase INPP4B plays a similar role to PTEN in suppressing the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and thereby suppressing tumor growth. We also show that
INPP4B is frequently deleted in a variety of solid tumors, including the majority of basallike breast cancers. These results suggest that PI3K pathway inhibitors in current clinical
trials may be effective in treating cancers where INPP4B is deleted.

Figure 1. A model indicating the roles of PTEN and INPP4B in regulation of signaling downstream
of Class I PI3Ks

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Upon stimulation of Class 1 PI3Ks two major phospholipid pools are generated: PI(3,4,5)P3
and PI(3,4)P2. PTEN hydrolyzes the 3′-phosphate of PI(3,4,5)P3 to terminate PI3K signaling.
However, SHIP family members hydrolyze the 5′-phosphate of PI(3,4,5)P3 to generate PI(3,4)
P2, which, like PI(3,4,5)P3, can facilitate PDK1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of
AKT. INPP4B converts PI(3,4)P2 to PI(3)P. Loss of PTEN or loss of INPP4B results in
prolonged activation of Akt, and subsequently in increased cell proliferation, cell migration
and invasion.

(A) Semi-quantitative RNA-levels of stable HMEC shRNA-INPP4B knockdown colonies
grown in anchorage-independent growth assays determined by RT-PCR. Both shRNA
hairpins, INPP4B-1 and INPP4B-2, directed against INPP4B resulted in approximately 65%
knockdown at the RNA level (n = 3). (B) Knockdown of INPP4B and PTEN in MCF-7 cells.
The human mammary epithelial cancer cell line MCF-7 was infected with shRNA hairpins
directed against Renilla, PTEN, and INPP4B (‘INPP4B-1’ and ‘INPP4B-2’). Protein levels of
INPP4B and PTEN in cells expressing the indicated shRNA were determined by using
immunoblotting. Protein loading was shown using antibody directed against GSK3beta. (C)
Anchorage-independent growth assay of stable HMEC cell pools infected with retrovirus
expressing shRNA directed against Renilla, PTEN, and two hairpin constructs directed against
INPP4B (‘INPP4B-1’ and ‘INPP4B-2’). Results are representative of four independent
experiments with similar results. Scale bar, 1mm. (D) Quantification of anchorage-independent
growth assay of stable HMEC shRNA cell pools (***p < 0.001, n = 3). (E) Proliferation assay
of stably infected HMEC shRNA cell pools. Cells from shRNA-Renilla, shRNA-PTEN,
shRNA-INPP4B-1 and shRNA-INPP4B+INPP4BR (rescue cell pool expressing knockdown
resistant INPP4B) were counted on day 2, 3, 4 and 5 in a Coulter counter. Averages of three
independent experiments are represented. All data are shown as mean +/− SD.

(A) Knocking down INPP4B or PTEN with shRNA enhances wound closure following a
scratch of confluent HMEC cells. Cells were photographed at time points t = 0 hours and t =
8 hours after wound introduction. Samples were observed under a light microscope. Scale bars,
50μm. (B) Quantification of wound closure. Displayed are the percentages of wound closure
at 8 hours after wound introduction determined using NIH Image J (Averages from 3
experiments like those in part A are presented **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001). (C) Expression
of an INPP4B sequence (INPP4BR) that circumvents the knockdown of endogenous INPP4B
reverses enhanced wound closure induced by INPP4B-1 shRNA. Expression of a catalytically
inactive form of INPP4B (INPP4BR-CD) did not suppress wound closure induced by
INPP4B-1 shRNA. The experiment was analogous to that in part A (Averages from three
experiments are presented, ***p<0.001). (D) The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (10 μM), inhibit
accelerated wound closure induced by knocking down INPP4B or PTEN in HMEC. The
experiments were analogous to those presented in Part A. (Averages from 3 experiments are
presented: ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01). (E) Knocking down the expression of PTEN or INPP4B
enhances the ability of MCF-10A cells to cross a matrigel barrier in a Boyden chamber assay.
MCF-10A were stably infected with shRNA directed against Renilla, PTEN, and INPP4B
(INPP4B-1 and INPP4B-2). Cells were seeded in transwell chambers containing matrigel as a
barrier. No stimulus was applied to the bottom chamber, in order to examine non-directional
invasive behavior in knockdown cell pools. 24 hours after seeding, invaded cells were fixed,
stained and quantified. (Average from three experiments are presented: ***p < 0.001). All data
are shown as mean +/− SD.

Figure 4. Knocking down INPP4B or PTEN in MCF-10A cells results in dysmorphic cell clusters
upon growth in three-dimensional culture, and overexpression of INPP4B suppresses tumor
growth in the SUM149 xenograft mouse model

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Stable MCF-10A shRNA cell pools were grown on a matrigel layer under differentiating
conditions and observed at day 21 of culture. Left panels display grown, untreated spheres of
Renilla, PTEN, and INPP4B knockdown cells. The same stable shRNA cell pools were treated
starting day 1 with 1 nM Rapamycin (middle left panels), 10 μM LY294002 (middle right
panels), or 10 μM UO126, respectively (right panels). Representative pictures are shown. The
experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Scale bar, 50μm. (B) Nude mice were
injected with the human invasive ductal carcinoma cell line SUM149 expressing Flag-INPP4B
(n=4) or empty Flag control (n=4). Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks post injection and tumor
growth and size evaluated. All mice injected with SUM149 cells expressing empty Flag vector
showed tumor growth (n=4), while mice injected with SUM149 cells expressing Flag-INPP4B
showed reduced tumor growth and size (n=2). (C) Quantification of tumor diameter in
xenograft experiment. All mice in the control group (SUM149+Flag Empty) showed tumor
growth (n=4). Overexpression of Flag-INPP4B in SUM149 resulted in reduced tumor growth
(n=4, p=0.011). (D) Protein levels of INPP4B in SUM149 cells expressing empty Flag vector
or Flag-INPP4B were determined by using immunoblotting. Protein loading was shown using
antibody directed against p85.

Figure 5. Substrate specificity of INPP4B

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) FLAG-tagged INPP4B was immunoprecipitated from 293T cells and incubated with either
[32P]-PI(3)P, or [32P]-PI(3,4)P2 or [32P]-PI(3,4,5)P3. As control, the phosphoinositides were
incubated with Flag-immunoprecipitate from transfected 293T cells expressing an empty Flagexpression construct. The percent hydrolysis of each lipid was determined by chloroform/
methanol/HCL extraction, thin layer chromatography and Phosphoimager analysis. (n=3: ***p
< 0.001). (B) Overexpression of human INPP4B causes a reduction in cellular PI(3,4)P2 levels
in vivo. 3T3-L6 cells were transiently transfected with empty Flag or Flag-INPP4B constructs
and labeled with [32P]-inorganic phosphate. Lipids were extracted, deacylated and the
headgroups separated by HPLC. The radioactivity in the glyceroyl-phosphoryl-inositol
moieties of each of the D-3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides was then normalized to the total
radioactivity in the more abundant phosphoinositides, PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 (which did not
significantly vary between experiments). The bars indicate per cent changes in these ratios in
INPP4B transfected cells compared to control cells. The actual ratios of radioactivity in each
lipid to total radioactivity in PI(4)P plus PI(4,5)P2 in the control 3T3-L6 cells were: PI(3)P –
3.2%, PI(3,5)P2 – 0.035%, PI(3,4)P2 – 0.17%, PI(3,4,5)P3 – 0.69%. (Averages from three
experiments are presented: *p<0.1). Protein expression of Flag-INPP4B in 3T3-L6 cells was
demonstrated by Immunoblotting. Protein loading was shown in using antibody directed
against PTEN. (Inset). All data are shown as mean +/− SD.

Figure 7. Knocking down the expression of INPP4B increases the duration of AKT activation in
response to insulin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Stable HMEC cell pools expressing shRNA vectors directed against Renilla, PTEN,
INPP4B (‘INPP4B-1’) or HMEC cell pools expressing the knockdown resistant INPP4B
expression construct in the shRNA-INPP4B-1 cell pool (‘INPP4B-1 + INPP4BR’) were serumstarved and stimulated with 100nM insulin for the indicated time periods. Cell lysates were
separated by SDS-PAGE and phospho-Akt detected with specific antibodies in Western blot
analysis. INPP4B knockdown cell pools display increased and prolonged phospho-Thr308 and
phospho-Ser473 Akt compared to Renilla control knockdown cell pools. Expression of a Flagtagged INPP4B construct harboring two silent mutations at Ser487 to render it resistant to
shRNA knockdown in shRNA-INPP4B-1 cell pools (INPP4BR) reversed prolonged Akt
phosphorylation. The results are representative of 4 separate experiments.
(B) Quantification of phospho-Thr308 Akt normalized to total Akt levels (n = 4, *p< 0.1,
**p<0.01, ***p<0.001). Quantification of each single time point was determined using NIH
ImageJ (n = 4). Data are shown as mean +/− SEM.

Figure 8. Loss of heterozygosity at the INPP4B locus occurs frequently in BRCA1-mutant and
basal-like breast cancers and ovarian cancers and correlates with decreased overall patient survival
and lymph node involvement

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the 4q31 region of Chromosome 4 from 43
high-grade human breast tumors is shown. In the data set, five tumors were carrying germline
BRCA1 mutations, 18 additional tumors displayed basal-like features and 20 tumors were nonbasal-like. The data come from 10K SNP array and were analyzed using dChip software. LOH
of INPP4B, located at 4q31.21, occurred in 60%, 55.6%, and 5% of BRCA1-mutant, basallike, and non-basal-like tumors, respectively (p<0.001). (B) Differential expression of INPP4B
in subtypes of breast cancers analyzed by gene expression array. Sample subsets are indicated
across the top as follows: BRCA1 germline mutation-associated tumors (B1, pink), sporadic
basal-like tumors (basal-like, red), Luminal predominantly ER positive and HER2 negative
tumors (ER+/HER2-, blue), and HER2 positive tumors (HER2+, green), and normal breast
samples from mammographic reductions (Normal, yellow). Each column represents an
individual sample. Each row represents the relative expression level measured from two
different probes to INPP4B. Relative expression levels are represented as follows: mean levels
are shown in white, expression levels above mean in progressively darker shades of red, and
expression levels below mean in progressively darker shades of blue. The relative expression
color scale is shown at the bottom. (C) Percent survival graph over time (in months) for breast
cancer tissue stained for INPP4B expression (n = 112). Tissues from breast cancer patients
were stained for INPP4B and scored for expression levels (0 = no expression, 1 = low
expression, 2 = high expression). Breast cancer patients with no expression of INPP4B in tumor
tissue showed significantly shorter over all survival compared to patients with low and high
INPP4B expression in breast tumor tissue (p = 0.0018). (D) Percent survival graph over time

(in months) for ovarian cancer tissue stained for INPP4B expression (n = 50). Tissues from
ovarian cancer patients were stained for INPP4B and scored for protein expression levels (0 =
no expression, 1 = low expression, 2 = high expression). Ovarian cancer patients with no
expression of INPP4B in tumor tissue showed poor over all survival compared to patients with
low or high INPP4B expression (p<0.0001). (E) Ovarian cancer tissues were analyzed for
correlation of loss of INPP4B protein expression and lymph node involvement (LN Met).
Lymph node metastases were found significantly more frequent in ovarian cancer tissues,
which lost INPP4B protein expression (p = 0.043). The graph displays percent of patients with
positive lymph nodes over INPP4B expression levels (0 = no expression, 1 = low expression,
2 = high expression).
