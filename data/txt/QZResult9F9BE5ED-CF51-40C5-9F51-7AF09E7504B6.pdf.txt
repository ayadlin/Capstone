Oxygen-Enhanced MRI Is a Major Advance in
Tumor Hypoxia Imaging
Mark W. Dewhirst and Samuel R. Birer

Introduction and Historical Perspective
It is well established that hypoxia is prevalent in human tumors
and is associated with resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (1–3); furthermore, hypoxia contributes to immune checkpoint activation (4–7), higher likelihood for development of
metastasis, and worse overall prognosis (8). Despite this knowledge, there is no established method for measuring hypoxia in
patients, nor are there FDA-approved means for reducing its
impact in the management of patients with cancer.
Literally, dozens of methods have been tried both preclinically
and clinically to reduce tumor hypoxia, with varying degrees of
success (9). A meta-analysis of over 10,000 patients enrolled in
nearly 90 randomized trials over the past 40 years revealed an OR
of 0.77 in favor of hypoxia modiﬁcation strategies (9). Phase III
trials have been conducted utilizing radiotherapy with or without
(i) increasing oxygen delivery with hyperbaric oxygen (10, 11) or
carbogen breathing with nicotinamide (12); (ii) the hypoxic
cytotoxin, tirapazamine (13, 14). Evofosfamide, another hypoxic
cytotoxin, was found to yield improved survival in a randomized
phase II trial when combined with gemcitabine in patients with
pancreatic cancer (15). Hypoxic radiosensitizing drugs that mimic
the action of oxygen to increase radiosensitivity of hypoxic cells
have also been tested in randomized studies (16). Some trials
were positive, but not a single method to reduce the impact of
tumor hypoxia has been adopted as standard-of-care for any
cancer on a worldwide basis. One of the major limitations of all
prior trials has been that tumors were not screened for presence of
hypoxia prior to patient enrollment. In three trials, imaging or
biopsy-based assays were performed, prior to therapy, to identify
hypoxic tumors. In all three studies, much better treatment
response was observed in those tumors identiﬁed as being hypoxic at baseline (12, 16, 17). Unfortunately, however, tumor
hypoxia has not been an entry criterion in any hypoxia modiﬁcation trial reported thus far. Therefore, the prognostic value of
hypoxia as a selection marker for hypoxia modiﬁcation trials is
not truly established. Ideally, future clinical trials would incorporate a method that determines whether a tumor is hypoxic
before a patient is enrolled in a clinical trial that involves hypoxia
modiﬁcation. This would ensure that the modiﬁcation is applied
only to the cohort that can beneﬁt.
Proof that hypoxic tumor cells could contribute to reduced
effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy was enabled by

the development of a polarographic needle (Eppendorf electrode) that could be used clinically. The polarographic sensor
was embedded in a needle and movement of the electrode into
tissue after insertion under image guidance was computer controlled. Hoeckel was the ﬁrst to report that hypoxia, as measured
with the Eppendorf, was associated with worse survival in
patients with cervix cancer (18). To date, over 100 articles have
been published using the Eppendorf, involving nearly every solid
tumor type (19, 20). In patients with cancers of the head and neck
(21, 22), cervix (23, 24), and prostate (25), who received radiotherapy, the presence of hypoxia was independently associated
with worse local control. In patients with breast cancer who were
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, reduction in hypoxia
was associated with paclitaxel treatment (26). Furthermore,
hypoxia was associated with greater likelihood for metastasis in
patients with soft-tissue sarcomas and cervix cancer (24, 27, 28).
Biopsy-based approaches have also been used to identify hypoxic
tumors, using "hypoxia marker" drugs such as pimonidazole
(12). These invasive methods have been marvelous tools to
establish the clinical importance of hypoxia, but they cannot
not be incorporated into routine clinical practice because of their
invasive nature and sparse tissue sampling, which may not reﬂect
the extent of tumor heterogeneity (29).

Imaging of Hypoxia Is the Solution for
Selecting Patients for Clinical Trials
The ideal method for hypoxia detection is imaging. The rationale is 2-fold: (i) the extent of hypoxia varies spatially and (ii) the
extent of hypoxia varies temporally (cycling hypoxia). Cycling
hypoxia occurs with frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 3 cycles per
hour (30, 31). Cycling hypoxia may increase oxidative stress in
tumors and indirectly upregulate stress survival pathways, such as
HIF1 and NF-kB (32). The impact of cycling hypoxia on treatment
response or patient outcome has never been tested, although
imaging methods capable of capturing aspects of cycling hypoxia
are available.
The ideal method for measuring hypoxia would (i) be noninvasive, (ii) be amenable to repeated measures, (iii) have high
spatial resolution, (iv) be cost-effective, and (v) be directly translatable to human trials. There is a variation in the ability of
reported hypoxia imaging methods to meet these performance
criteria. See Supplementary Table S1 for a comparison of reported
methods.
In this issue of Cancer Research, a manuscript from the group of
O'Connor validates oxygen-enhanced MRI (OE-MRI) to quantify
the spatial variation of hypoxia (33). The principle is based on
measurement of R1, which is sensitive to the oxygen concentration
in interstitial ﬂuid and plasma. The approach involves examining
the change in R1 after a challenge with oxygen breathing. The
author's hypothesis was that the subvolumes refractory to change
in R1 (~R1 ¼ 0) during oxygen breathing would be hypoxic. They
tested the hypothesis by comparing the spatial distribution of
~R1 values against the distribution of the hypoxia marker drug

pimonidazole in image-registered sections of three tumor lines
that varied in extent of hypoxia. Pimonidazole binds to hypoxic
cells to form stable protein adducts when oxygen tensions are
<10 mm Hg; the adducts are detected by IHC (34, 35). Here,
O'Connor found linear correlations between pimonidazole binding and ~R1. This type of correlation has also been observed in a
brain tumor model (36). O'Connor also demonstrated that
correction for perfusion may be necessary for tumors that exhibit
extensive necrosis. This was done using dynamic contrast
enhanced (DCE)-MRI. Finally, they demonstrated that the hypoxic fraction (~R1 ¼ 0) increased when animals were treated with
hydralazine, a vasoactive drug that is well known to increase
tumor hypoxia by decreasing perfusion.
The advantage of the OE-MRI method versus other imaging
approaches to detect hypoxia is that it is amenable to repeated
measures, which enables assessment of cycling hypoxia and
response to hypoxia-modifying approaches. Second, MRI has
better spatial resolution (Fig. 1) and is less expensive than PET.
The inclusion of DCE-MRI to screen for necrosis may be
considered a disadvantage of OE-MRI, but both ~R1 and
DCE-MRI could be incorporated into one imaging session. This
method is also potentially superior to blood-oxygen-level
dependent (BOLD) MRI, which is based upon measurement
of R2 , an MR parameter that is sensitive to the oxygenation
state of hemoglobin (37). Aside from the limitations of the
BOLD method, as indicated by the authors, hyperoxic gases can
be vasoactive. The vasoactive effects can change tumor perfusion and affect hematocrit, which independently affects the
BOLD signal (38). As the ~R1 method is not dependent upon

hemoglobin saturation, it would not be inﬂuenced by hemodynamic effects of hyperoxic gas breathing.
The last point to make regarding this article is whether there
is a physiologic basis for tumor regions being refractory to
hyperoxic gas challenge. First, there are multiple studies demonstrating that subregions of tumors do not increase in pO2 in
response to hyperoxic gas breathing. Falk studied the oxygenation of human tumors with the Eppendorf electrode during air
and carbogen breathing, ﬁnding a proportion of tumors that
were refractory to this challenge (39). Similar results were
reported in a rat prostate tumor model using perﬂuorocarbon
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which can be calibrated to
directly measure pO2 (40). The underlying physiologic mechanism for this lack of response to hyperoxic gas challenge is
related to longitudinal oxygen gradients. Longitudinal gradients are deﬁned as the decline in vascular pO2 moving from
arteries to arterioles and ﬁnally to capillaries. These gradients
exist because oxygen is lost from the blood as it traverses from
the lung and into the general circulation. In the hamster
cheekpouch, for example, terminal arteriolar pO2 is near 15
to 20 mm Hg during air breathing (41). In comparison, blood
gas pO2 is near 100 mm Hg during air breathing. Consequently,
80% of oxygen is lost from the vasculature before blood enters
the terminal vascular bed. In normal tissues, there is a redundancy in arteriolar supply and microvessels to the extent that
the tissues remain sufﬁciently oxygenated even in the presence
of the longitudinal O2 gradient. Tumors, in contrast, have
relatively few arterioles, so the efﬁciency in maintaining adequate oxygen delivery is signiﬁcantly compromised. We veriﬁed

report involving PET imaging of hypoxia; details of histology methods and analysis were described in that report (35). Brieﬂy, the rat was administered
with the hypoxia marker drug, EF5, 3 hours prior to sacriﬁce; orange staining regions indicate EF5 binding in hypoxic regions. The lobes on either side of the
prominent hypoxic band represent viable tissue as demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin stain and perfusion marker (not depicted). B, each small red

box represents 1 mm spatial resolution, which is typical of that achieved with MRI (top). The bottom section discretizes intensity of EF5 staining in each
box in grayscale. The most intensely stained regions are white, nonstaining regions are in black, and intermediate regions are in gray. With this spatial resolution,

the hypoxic band is still clearly visible. C, the red box represents 1 cm spatial resolution, which is more typical of PET and optical methods (top). Bottom,

These partial volume effects obscure the presence of the hypoxic band and instead report the voxel as representing an intermediate level of hypoxia.

that tumor arterioles are subject to the same longitudinal
oxygen gradients as normal tissues (42). Using skin-fold window chambers containing a rat mammary carcinoma, we used
polarographic microelectrodes to show that the average pO2 of
tumor-feeding arterioles was 30 mm Hg. When breathing gas
was switched to 100% O2, terminal arteriolar pO2 only rose by
a factor of 2, whereas blood gas pO2 increased 5-fold (from 100
to 500 mm Hg). This steep in the oxygen gradient occurs
because hemoglobin is fully saturated in the lung with air
breathing. Therefore, excess O2 from hyperoxic gases can only
be absorbed in plasma, which cannot retain O2 to the same
extent as hemoglobin. Indeed, it was shown that tumor microvessels most distant from feeding arterioles were hypoxic and
refractory to breathing either carbogen or oxygen (43).

In summary, the rationale for being able to measure tumor
hypoxia remains exceedingly compelling. To maximize the likelihood that patients will beneﬁt from methods to selectively
eliminate hypoxic cells, methods to identify patients who have
hypoxic tumors are urgently needed. The OE-MRI method
described in the article by O'Connor and colleagues, holds promise as a relatively cost-effective method that could be adopted for
clinical trials with minimal additional validation.
