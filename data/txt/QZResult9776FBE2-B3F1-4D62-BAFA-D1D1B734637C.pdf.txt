ABSTRACT
Approximately, 25–30% of early-stage breast tumors are classified at the
molecular level as HER2-positive, which is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer.
Amplification of the HER2 gene in these tumors results in a substantial increase in
HER2 mRNA levels, and consequently, HER2 protein levels. HER2, a transmembrane
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is targeted therapeutically by a monoclonal antibody,
trastuzumab (Tz), which has dramatically improved the prognosis of HER2-driven
breast cancers. However, ~30% of patients develop resistance to trastuzumab
and recur; and nearly all patients with advanced disease develop resistance over
time and succumb to the disease. Mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance (TzR) are
not well understood, although some studies suggest that growth factor signaling
through other receptors may be responsible. However, these studies were based
on cell culture models of the disease, and thus, it is not known which pathways
are driving the resistance in vivo. Using an integrative transcriptomic approach of
RNA isolated from trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ tumors,
and isogenic cell culture models, we identified a small set of mRNAs and lincRNAs
that are associated with trastuzumab-resistance (TzR). Functional analysis of a top
candidate gene, S100P, demonstrated that inhibition of S100P results in reversing
TzR. Mechanistically, S100P activates the RAS/MEK/MAPK pathway to compensate
for HER2 inhibition by trastuzumab. Finally, we demonstrated that the upregulation of
S100P appears to be driven by epigenomic changes at the enhancer level. Our current
findings should pave the path toward new therapies for breast cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

encompassing the HER2 gene (also known as HER2/neu
and ERBB2), which is a member of the ERBB family
of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) [1].
Although no known ligands bind to the HER2 receptor
itself, a number of ligands bind to other ERBB family
members (e.g., HER3), and lead to the heterodimerization
of these members with HER2 [4]. Heterodimerization
results in autophosphorylation by the intracellular tyrosine
kinase domain of HER2, and the initiation of a signaling
cascade that results in the activation and repression of

Breast cancer is a major health problem affecting
millions of patients worldwide, and results in over
500,000 deaths annually. Previous studies have led to
the classification of breast tumors into several molecular
subtypes, with HER2-positive (HER2+) tumors
representing ~25–30% of early-stage breast cancer patients’
diagnoses [1–3]. HER2+ tumors are characterized at the
molecular level by an amplification of a genomic region

specific mRNAs and long intergenic non-coding RNAs
(lincRNAs) [5].
Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) is a monoclonal antibody
that binds to the extracellular domain of the HER2
receptor, and is thought to inhibit its heterodimerization,
and consequently, its signaling cascade [6]. Currently,
trastuzumab is the standard of care for HER2+ breast
cancer patients as 70% of early-stage patients appear to
be cured by trastuzumab and chemotherapy. However,
a significant percentage of early-stage patients (~30%)
relapse after this combination by unclear mechanisms
[7]. Furthermore, most patients who relapse will acquire
resistance to trastuzumab during therapy and succumb
to the disease [6, 8, 9]. Although several mechanisms of
TzR have been proposed, it has been difficult to show
convincingly that these occur in the clinical setting [6, 9].
For example, it was hypothesized that resistance occurs
due to shedding of the extracellular domain of HER2, and
thus, trastuzumab is no longer able to bind to HER2 [10],
however, no experimental evidence has been presented to
support this. Other models proposed that HER3 signaling
could compensate for HER2 inhibition by trastuzumab.
However, patients who received a combination of
trastuzumab and pertuzumab, which blocks HER2-HER3
interaction, have a median progression-free survival of 5.5
months [11]. Thus, it is clear that other mechanisms of
resistance are at play in tumors in vivo.
Given the immense potential clinical benefits in
identifying mechanisms of TzR, we decided to take a
comprehensive and unbiased approach to identify the
key cellular factors that drive TzR in humans in vivo.
By applying next generation RNA-sequencing to RNA
isolated from human HER2+ tumors and cell culture
models of the disease that are either trastuzumab-sensitive
(TzS) or trastuzumab-resistant (TzR), we have identified
a small set of mRNAs and lincRNAs that are strongly
associated with TzR (Figure 1A). Functional studies of a
top candidate gene, S100P, demonstrated that inhibition of
S100P results in reversal of trastuzumab-resistance (TzR).
Our study provides for the first time a clinically relevant
mechanism of TzR, and opens the door for exploring
novel therapeutic strategies.

(see methods). In this clinical trial, 50 patient tumors
were biopsied at the beginning of the trial prior to
receiving trastuzumab (pre-trastuzumab). After receiving
a combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab for
4 months, a subset of thirteen tumors, representing the
extremes of response to treatment, were selected for gene
expression analysis by RNA-seq. Eleven of those thirteen
patients were identified as responders (i.e., trastuzumabsensitive or TzS) and two patients were identified as
non-responders (i.e., trastuzumab-resistant or TzR) as
measured by pathological complete response (pCR) or
clinical non-response (SD+PD). We compared mRNA
gene expression between the responders (TzS) and nonresponders (TzR), and identified differentially expressed
genes between the two groups prior to receiving treatment
(pre-trastuzumab) (Figure 1A). Specifically, we identified
~1,542 mRNAs and 371 lincRNAs that are differentially
expressed (Figure 1B, and Supplementary Files S1
and S2). We performed pathway analysis on differentially
expressed mRNAs, and found several pathways to be
affected including those related to mammary gland cell
proliferation and development (Figure 1C). Also, RAGE
receptor binding was statistically significant and emerged
as a key player (see below). Currently, it is not possible
to perform pathway analysis on lincRNAs as only a small
percentage of all annotated lincRNAs (~10,000 in the
human genome) have been functionally characterized
(~200 lincRNAs) [12].

Characterization of TzS and TzR HER2+ cell
culture model
To further pinpoint key mRNAs and lincRNAs that
contribute to TzR, we generated TzR HER2+ BT474 cells
by chronically exposing the cell line to trastuzumab over
six weeks. To confirm that we have generated BT474 cells
that are resistant to trastuzumab (TzR), we measured cell
proliferation of the parental TzS and isogenic TzR cells
under exposure to trastuzumab over a 96 hour time period.
We found that the proliferation of parental TzS BT474
cells is significantly affected when exposed to trastuzumab
within 48 hours. By contrast, the proliferation of TzR
BT474 cells was not affected (Figure 2A–2B).
Next, we examined the effect of trastuzumab on
HER2 and phospho-HER2 (p-HER2) protein levels in TzS
and TzR cells. We found TzS cells to express comparable
levels of HER2 protein to TzR cells (Figure 2C). However,
trastuzumab strongly inhibits the phosphorylation of
HER2 (p-HER2) in TzS cells within 24 hours of exposure
(Figure 2D). Next, we examined the expression of HER2
and p-HER2 levels in both TzS and TzR cells over a
96-hour time course, and found: i. HER2 protein levels
are not significantly affected in the parental TzS line by
trastuzumab until the 96-hour time point (Figure 2E),
ii. p-HER2 levels significantly decrease in the parental
TzS line within 12 hours post-exposure to trastuzumab

RESULTS
Identification of differentially expressed mRNAs
and lincRNAs in trastuzumab-sensitive (TzS)
vs trastuzumab-resistant (TzR) human tumors
in vivo
We hypothesized that TzR tumors have a distinct
gene expression profile compared to TzS tumors, and a
subset of these differentially expressed coding and noncoding genes mediate the observed resistance. To that
end, we applied RNA-seq to RNA isolated from HER2+
tumor biopsies that were collected during a clinical trial

in a cell culture model of TzR

(Figure 2F), iii. Surprisingly, both HER2 and p-HER2
levels are significantly affected in the TzR BT474 cells at
48 hours post exposure to trastuzumab (Figure 2G–2H).
The decrease in HER2 and p-HER2 levels in the TzR line
demonstrates that trastuzumab can still bind to and inhibit
HER2 phosphorylation in TzR cells. These observations
demonstrate that the mechanism of TzR, at least in a
subset of tumors, is not due to truncation or mutations of
HER2 that precludes trastuzumab binding.

To identify genes associated with TzR in our cell
culture model described above, we quantified changes in
gene expression between parental TzS BT474 and TzR
BT474 cells by RNA-seq. We identified 233 mRNAs and
34 lincRNAs as differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 2,
p ≤ 0.05) (Figure 3A–3B, Supplementary Files S3 and S4).

To further refine our list of genes that are specifically
associated with TzR, and not due to short-term exposure
to trastuzumab, we treated the parental TzS BT474 cells
with trastuzumab, and collected RNA at 48 hours postexposure. We measured changes in gene expression
by RNA-seq and identified 242 mRNAs and 27

lincRNAs that are differentially expressed as compared
to mock treated cells (≥ 2 fold change and p  ≤  0.05)
(Supplementary Files S5 and S6). Subsequently, mRNAs
and lincRNAs that are affected by short-term exposure to
trastuzumab were subtracted from mRNAs and lincRNAs
that are differentially expressed in TzR vs TzS cells.

This enabled us to further pinpoint mRNAs and lincRNAs
that are specifically associated with long-term resistance to
trastuzumab in culture. This analysis narrowed down the
gene list to 201 mRNAs and 25 lincRNAs.
We intersected mRNAs and lincRNAs identified
in our cell culture model with differentially expressed
mRNAs and lincRNAs identified in our in vivo data set
(clinical trial). This analysis led to the identification of
18 mRNAs and 7 lincRNAs that are associated with TzR
in vivo and in cell culture, with concordant expression
patterns (p < 0.0001, two-tailed Fischer’s exact test)
(Supplementary File S7). Expression of top mRNA
genes identified in our analysis in TzS vs TzR tumors
in vivo is shown using cluster graphs, HER2 expression
is also shown to demonstrate that HER2 levels do not
change dramatically between TzS and TzR tumors
(Figure 4). Careful examination of these genes, their
known roles in breast cancer, and our bioinformatics
analysis of key pathways associated with TzR in vivo
(see Figure 1C), suggested a potential key role of

S100P. S100P is part of the S100 protein family, has
documented roles in tumorigenesis [13], and is known
to bind to the receptor RAGE (see Figure 1C), and
activates similar signaling pathways to those activated
by HER2 signaling. Furthermore, analysis of S100P in
Oncomine demonstrated that S100P is strongly associated
with breast cancer (p = 1.8E-94, average fold change
= 10.9) (Supplementary Figure S1). Lastly, examination
of RNA-seq of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) also
demonstrated that S100P is highly upregulated in HER2+
breast cancer (Figure 5A).
To further confirm the upregulation of S100P in
TzR cells, we examined S100P mRNA and protein levels
in the TzS vs TzR BT474 cell line utilized for our RNAseq studies, and two independently generated TzS vs TzR
BT474 and SKBR3 cell lines (three isogenic TzS vs TzR
cell lines total). We found S100P to be upregulated at both
the mRNA (Figure 5B) and protein levels (Figure  5C),
with potentially increased stability of the S100P mRNA
in SKBR3 cells. Importantly, we found S100P to be

compared to normal human mammary epithelial cells

that were infected with either shGFP or shS100P in mock vs
trastuzumab treatments. BT474 cells infected with shGFP
showed no response to trastuzumab (Figure 6A), by contrast,
the proliferation of TzR BT474 cells infected with shS100P
was significantly impacted when exposed to trastuzumab
(Figure 6B–6C). We also examined the rate of apoptosis
of TzR cells in response to shRNA-mediated depletion of
S100P, and found a significant increase in apoptosis in TzR
cells treated with shS100P vs shGFP (Supplementary Figure
S4). Lastly, we performed soft agar colony formation assays
under trastuzumab treatment, and found that the knock
down of S100P results in a significant decrease in number of
colonies, as compared to shGFP (Figure 7A). Collectively,
these data demonstrate that depletion of S100P partially resensitizes TzR cells to trastuzumab.

Inhibition of S100P reverses TzR in a cell culture
model
To test the potential role of S100P in TzR, we
designed and tested five distinct shRNAs against S100P,
and identified two shRNAs that are effective at knocking
down S100P (Supplementary Figure S3A). To determine
if the depletion of S100P would re-sensitize TzR cells to
trastuzumab, we tested the proliferation of TzR BT474 cells

S100P activates Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway

with trastuzumab and recombinant S100P protein, and the
levels of pMAPK, MAPK and histone H3 (control) were
measured by WB. We found that trastuzumab treatment
results in reducing p-MAPK levels, but the addition of
S100P recombinant protein is sufficient to restore p-MAPK
protein levels (Figure 7B). Next, we examined the effect
of knocking down S100P on p-MAPK in TzR cells. We
found that TzR cells harboring shGFP had minor reduction
of p-MAPK when treated with trastuzumab, however, TzR
cells harboring shS100P showed significant reduction of
p-MAPK when treated with trastuzumab (Figure 7C).
These findings demonstrate that the upregulation of S100P

S100P is known to bind to the receptor RAGE,
leading to activation of the Ras/MEK/MAPK and other
signaling pathways [14]. The Ras/MEK/MAPK is a
key pathway that is known to be activated by HER2
signaling [1]. To test the hypothesis that S100P leads to
activation of Ras/MEK/MAPK, and thus compensates
for HER2 inhibition by trastuzumab, we performed the
following experiments. First, we examined the effect of
recombinant S100P on p-MAPK in TzS cells as follows:
BT474 cells (TzS) were treated with trastuzumab alone or

identified in our RNA-seq analysis, including S100P
(Figure 8). Both H3K4me1 and H3K27ac profiles indicate
that the upregulation of S100P in TzR cells is driven
by epigenetic changes at several enhancers regulating
S100P (Figure 8, and Supplementary Figure S6). These
findings indicate that trastuzumab-resistance is wired at
the epigenetic level, at least for a subset of genes identified
in our study.

Upregulation of S100P is driven by epigenetic
changes at enhancers
To identify the potential mechanism(s) that drive
increased S100P expression in TzR tumors and cell lines,
we examined global changes in the epigenome at enhancer
regions. Specifically, we examined changes in histone H3
lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) and H3 lysine 27
acetylation (H3K27ac), two key histone modifications
associated with active enhancers [15]. First, we identified
genome-wide changes in H3K4me1 and H3K27ac
between TzS and TzR cells (Supplementary Figure S5,
Supplementary Files S8 and S9). Next, we specifically
examined enhancers surrounding top candidate genes

DISCUSSION
Trastuzumab was originally developed and utilized
as an adjuvant therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast
cancer, and currently as an adjuvant therapy in early-stage
HER2-positive patients [16–19]. The clinical utilization of
trastuzumab has revolutionized the treatment of HER2positive breast cancer patients, however, a significant

percentage of patients (~30%) do not respond to
trastuzumab or acquire resistance to it, by largely unknown
mechanisms [9, 10]. Because of the immense therapeutic
benefits of trastuzumab to HER2-positive breast cancer

patients, it is critical to identify the mechanisms of TzR.
Although a number of models of TzR have been proposed,
none has been proven to be present in clinical specimens
from patients treated with Trastuzmab. In this manuscript,

we have taken an unbiased genome-wide approach
to identify genes and pathways that may drive and/or
contribute to TzR. By utilizing next generation RNA-seq
(RNA-seq) of RNA isolated from tumors and cell lines
that are either TzS or TzR, we identified key genes and
pathways that potentially contribute to TzR. Importantly,
the utilization of tumor biopsies from patients that are
either sensitive or resistant to trastuzumab enabled us to
obtain clinically relevant data. However, it is important to
point out that the tissue culture models used in our studies
do not represent all HER2+ tumors, and thus, we may
have missed other key genes and pathways that could also
contribute to trastuzumab-resistance.
Many of the mRNAs that we identified as associated
with TzR have been previously shown to be dysregulated
in various types of cancer. MATN2 and SCGB2A2
are upregulated in ovarian cancer [20, 21]; S100P is
upregulated in prostate cancer, invasive ductal carcinomas,
and pancreatic cancer [22]; LDHB is a biomarker for triple
negative breast cancer [23]; and TNC is associated with
Tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer [24]. Although the
exact roles of these genes in TzR are yet to be elucidated,
previous studies of these genes in cancer should provide
some preliminary insights. For example, the role of S100P
in the activation of RAGE-mediated Ras/MEK/MAPK
signaling provides clues into its role in TzR [14, 25].
S100P emerged as a top candidate for functional
studies as it showed strong association with TzR both
in vivo and in vitro studies, it is highly upregulated in
many cancer types, and it belongs to the S100 family
of proteins with well-documented roles in tumorigenesis
[13]. S100 family members, including S100P, function
as homodimers with a Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif [26].
Calcium binding to S100P promotes a conformational
change exposing hydrophobic residues, which enables
the interaction with protein binding partners [27]. S100P
acts as both an intracellular and extracellular signaling
molecule, and has been observed in the nucleus,
cytoplasm, and extracellular matrix [28]. Previous
studies of S100P in breast cancer have demonstrated
that the expression of S100P correlates with breast
cancer progression and decreased patient survival
[29–32]. Also, S100P roles in tumorigenesis have been
well-documented in pancreatic cancer. These studies
have demonstrated that S100P exerts its oncogenic
activities via interaction and activation of the receptor
RAGE [14, 25]. The extracellular ligand-binding domain
of RAGE is known to bind to a number of ligands,
including S100P, to initiate downstream signaling
pathways that promote cell proliferation, survival, and
motility [33, 34]. Blocking S100P interaction with
RAGE is sufficient to significantly impact the growth
of tumors [25, 33]. These findings suggest that S100PRAGE interaction could be therapeutically blocked to
reverse TzR, at least in a subset of HER2+ patients.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To gain insights into the potential mechanisms
driving changes in gene expression of S100P and other
key genes identified in our study in TzS vs TzR cells, we
examined chromatin changes at enhancers. Enhancers
play major roles in regulating gene expression in virtually
all cell types, and are known to become altered in
cancer [15]. Two key chromatin marks, H3K4me1 and
H3K27ac, identify active enhancers across the genome,
and examining these two marks in TzS vs TzR cells
demonstrated changes in enhancer activity at many loci.
Enhancers regulating S100P showed higher levels of
both H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in TzR cells as compared
to TzS cells. These observations suggest that TzR cells
acquire epigenetic changes that impact gene expression,
and consequently, growth advantages.
Our study also led to the identification of long
intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) that are
dysregulated in TzR tumors and cell lines. We and others
previously demonstrated critical roles of lincRNAs in
regulating gene expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level in mammalian and other systems
[35–44]. Currently, the role of these lincRNAs in TzR
is yet to be elucidated, but they could potentially offer
novel mechanistic insights and therapeutic targets in
cancer biology. A major mechanism utilized by lincRNAs
to regulate gene expression is via the recruitment of
chromatin-modifying complexes and other proteins
to specific gene loci [38, 42, 43, 45–50]. Thus, such
lincRNAs, when they become dysregulated in cancer,
could have profound effect on the epigenome [42]. By
targeting such lincRNAs, we could potentially modulate
the epigenetic landscape of cancer cells to a normal
state, at least partially [51]. A key advantage of targeting
lincRNAs is their tissue-specific expression, potentially
reducing negative side effects. In future studies, we will
assess the roles of these lincRNAs in TzR, and their
potential utility as therapeutic targets.
In summary, we have utilized both clinical HER2+
tumor samples and cell culture models of trastuzumabresistance to identify key mRNAs and lincRNAs
associated with resistance to trastuzumab in tumors
in vivo. Our findings provide a small list of potential
therapeutic targets that can be experimentally tested to
develop novel therapies for this aggressive form of breast
cancer.

per kilobase of exon per million of mapped fragments).
For our analysis, transcript expression was defined as if
the FPKM value across either all non-responders (TzR) or
all responders (TzS) samples were ≥ 1.0 for mRNAs and
≥ 0.25 for lincRNAs. The mean expression was calculated
for TzR and TzS and the fold change was calculated as
TzR/TzS to identify differentially expressed transcripts.
Transcripts were defined as differentially expressed if the
fold change was ≥ 2.0 or ≤ 0.5. Heatmaps were generated
in R using heatmap.2 with Z scores scaled by row using
standard Z score calculation of log fold change.

RNA isolation from cell lines
RNA was isolated from cell lines using RNeasy®
Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol with an addition of DNase (Qiagen) treatment
step after the first wash to remove DNA contamination.

Next generation RNA-sequencing
RNA isolated from cell lines was assessed for
quality using BioRad Experion with an RNA integrity
number (RIN) ≥ 8 as threshold for high quality, suitable
for RNA-sequencing. Library preparation was performed
using Scriptseq™ Complete Gold (Human/Mouse/Rat)
(Illumina) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 with six
samples run per flow cell. The 100 bp paired-end strandspecific sequences were mapped to the human genome
release hg19 using TopHat with 2 mismatches allowed
for full-length reads. Raw reads were mapped to human
mRNAs annotated in the RefSeq database and lincRNAs
annotated in Cabili et al. [52] using Cufflinks V2.0.2.
Expression values were calculated as FPKM (fragment
per kilobase of exon per million of mapped fragments).
Transcripts were considered expressed if FPKM values
across either all TzR samples or all TzS samples were
≥ 1.0 for mRNA and ≥ 0.25 for lincRNAs. The mean
expression values were calculated for expressed transcripts
followed by fold change (TzR/TzS) with statistical
significance calculated using a paired t-test. Transcripts
were defined as differentially expressed if the fold change
was ≥ 2.0 or ≤ 0.5 and p < 0.05. Heatmaps were generated
in R using heatmap.2 with Z scores scaled by row using
standard Z score calculation of log fold change.

Cell lines
TzS cells were treated with 10 μg/ml trastuzumab
for at least six weeks to acquire TzR. Human breast cancer
cell lines used in this study were grown in Hybri-Care
Medium (ATCC_46-X™) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Bioexpress) and 100 units/ml penicillin
and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) at 37°C
with 5% CO2. TzR cell lines are maintained in 10 μg/ml
of trastuzumab.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation assays were performed using
CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
(Promega) as indicated by manufacturer’s instructions and
read as absorbance at 490 nm.

Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
RNA was converted to cDNA using RNA to cDNA
EcoDry™ Premix Random Hexamers (Clontech). Primer
pairs were designed using primer3 software (Untergrasser
et al., 2007) with most spanning exon-exon boundaries.
Maxima SyBr Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo
Scientific) was used for qRT-PCR. A comparative CT
quantitation was performed with a hold stage of 50°C for
2 min and 95°C for 10 min followed by 40× cycles of
95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min, and finally a melt
curve at 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 1 min, and a ramp to
95°C at 0.3°C increments. Analysis was done using the
2ΔΔCT method with GAPDH as the reference gene [53].

Western blot analyses
Protein lysates were prepared with Laemmli Sample
Buffer (BioRad) and separated on a 4–20% gradient
SDS-PAGE Mini-Protean TGXTM Gels (BioRad). Gels
were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo
Scientific) and probed with primary antibodies overnight
at the following dilutions: anti-actin (Ambion, AM4302,
3.1 mg/ml) 1:1000, anti-HER2/Erb2 (Cell Signaling,
2242S) 1:1000, anti-HER2-phospho (Fisher, MS-1072-P0,
200 μg/ml) 1:500, anti-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (3A7)
(Cell Signaling, 9107S) 1:1000, anti-phospho-p44/42
MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling,
4370P) 1:500, and anti-H3 (Cell Signaling, 9715S)
1:2000. Secondary antibodies anti-mouse HRP (Thermo
Scientific, 32230) and anti-rabbit HRP (Abcam, ab6721)

Apoptosis assay
Cells were plated at 5000 cells/well in a 96-well
plate. After 5 hours, the media was replaced and trastuzumab
53241

Oncotarget

(10 μg/ml) was added. After 48 hours, Caspase-Glo® 3/7
Assay (Promega, G8091) reagent was added to the wells.
The plate was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature and
the luminescence was read by spectrophotometer. The
luminescence reading was normalized to the mock treatment
of each cell line to calculate relative apoptosis.

Cells were crosslinked, sonicated, chromatin
immunoprecipitated and converted into libraries for deep
sequencing. For each ChIP, 6 μg of anti-Histone H3K4
monomethyl (Abcam ab8895) or anti-Histone H3K27
acetyl (Abcam ab4729) were bound to 100 μl of protein
G dynabeads (Life Technologies 10004D) and incubated
with sonicated lysate from 5 million crosslinked cells.
Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were end-repaired,
received an overhanging A base, and then ligated to
Illumina TruSeq indexed adapters [700 nM] that were
annealed from oligonucleotides (IDT, HPLC-purified).
Sample clean-up between steps was performed with
PCRCleanDx beads (Aline Biosciences). Adaptermodified DNA fragments were PCR-amplified and sizeselected on agarose gel for 250–350 bp. ChIP-seq libraries
were sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 platform at the Case
Western Reserve University Genomics Core Facility.
The FASTX-Toolkit 0.0.13 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/
fastx_toolkit/) was used to remove adapter sequences and
trim read ends using a quality score cutoff of 20. ChIP-seq
data were aligned to the hg19 genome assembly (retrieved
from http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html), using
Bowtie v0.12.9 [54], allowing reads with ≤ 2 mismatches
and discarding reads with > 1 reportable alignment
("-m 1" parameter). PCR duplicates were removed
using SAMtools. Peaks were detected with MACS v1.4
with a threshold for significant enrichment of P < 1E-9.
Wiggle tracks stepped at 25 bp were generated by MACS,
normalized to the mean whole-genome WIG signal and
visualized on the UCSC Genome Browser.

Soft agar assays
50,000 BT474 shS100P or BT474 shGFP cells were
suspended in 0.6% type VII agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) in
10% FBS RPMI medium and plated onto a bottom layer of
1.2% agar in 10% FBS RPMI medium. Cells were plated
onto 60mm plates in quadruplicate. 1mL of 10% FBS
RPMI with 10 µg/mL trastuzumab was added 24 hours
after plating. The medium was changed every 2 days, with
fresh trastuzumab added, until cells were analyzed after
3 weeks. To quantify colonies, each plate was scanned
using an automated multipanel scanning microscope and
the digital images were analyzed using MetaMorph image
quantification software.
