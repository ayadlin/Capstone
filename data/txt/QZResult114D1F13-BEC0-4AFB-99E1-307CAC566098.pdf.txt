Abstract
Intrinsic and acquired resistance to HER-targeting drugs occurs in a signiﬁcant proportion of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Thus, there remains a need to identify predictive biomarkers that could improve
patient selection and circumvent these types of drug resistance. Here, we report the identiﬁcation of neuromedin
U (NmU) as an extracellular biomarker in cells resistant to HER-targeted drugs. NmU overexpression occurred in
cells with acquired or innate resistance to lapatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib, and afatinib, all of which displayed a
similar trend upon short-term exposure, suggesting NmU induction may be an early response. An analysis of
3,489 cases of breast cancer showed NmU to be associated with poor patient outcome, particularly those with
HER2-overexpressing tumors independent of established prognostic indicators. Ectopic overexpression of NmU
in drug-sensitive cells conferred resistance to all HER-targeting drugs, whereas RNAi-mediated attenuation
sensitized cells exhibiting acquired or innate drug resistance. Mechanistic investigations suggested that NmU
acted through HSP27 as partner protein to stabilize HER2 protein levels. We also obtained evidence of functional
NmU receptors on HER2-overexpressing cells, with the addition of exogenous NmU eliciting an elevation in HER2
and EGFR expression along with drug resistance. Finally, we found that NmU seemed to function in cell motility,
invasion, and anoikis resistance. In vivo studies revealed that NmU attenuation impaired tumor growth and
metastasis. Taken together, our results deﬁned NmU as a candidate drug response biomarker for HER2overexpressing cancers and as a candidate therapeutic target to limit metastatic progression and improve the
efﬁcacy of HER-targeted drugs. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3821–33. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
HER2 overexpression occurs in approximately 25% of breast
cancer and is associated with poor prognosis (1, 2). Targeting
HER2 with trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech), a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of
the growth factor receptor, has shown activity as a single agent
and in combination with classical chemotherapy in HER2overexpressing breast cancer (3–5). HER2 has also been

successfully targeted with lapatinib (Tykerb; GlaxoSmithKline), a reversible dual kinase inhibitor directed at the intracellular ATP-binding domain of the receptor and its dimerisation partner, EGFR/HER1, rendering it kinase inactive (6, 7).
Unfortunately, not all HER2-positive patients respond to trastuzumab (8, 9) or lapatinib (10–12) and those that initially
respond may acquire resistance. More recently developed
neratinib (Pﬁzer/Puma Biotechnology) is an irreversible
small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of EGFR/HER1,
HER2, and HER4 (13). In advanced HER2-overexpressing
breast cancers, including trastuzumab-refractory and trastuzumab-na€ve patients, single-agent neratinib demonstrated
some clinical beneﬁts in both cohorts (14) and phase III clinical
trials are underway. Our preclinical studies show that HER2overexpressing cell lines acquire resistance to neratinib, as they
did to trastuzumab and lapatinib; although it is too early
to know whether this will occur in the clinic. Afatinib (BIBW
2992, Boehringer Ingelheim), another irreversible oral smallmolecule TKI of EGFR/HER1, HER2, and HER4 has shown
single-agent activity in a phase II trial including trastuzumabrefractory HER2-positive metastatic breast cancers (15).
Targeting HER2 and other HER family members is, undoubtedly, providing signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt in patients with
HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. However, innate/primary

and acquired resistance represents substantial clinical challenges, in addition to the lack of means to predict patients'
response. Predictive biomarkers for HER-targeting drugs (ideally extracellular, minimally invasive) are needed for improved
patient selection and thus enhanced patient outcome, as are
novel therapeutic strategies to circumvent resistance. Our
previous studies indicate that analyzing extracellular RNAs in
medium conditioned by cells can be a useful starting point to
identifying potential biomarkers, some proving to have functional relevance within the cell (16–20).
Neuromedin U (NmU) is a secreted neuropeptide and a
member of neuromedin peptide family originally isolated
from porcine spinal cord (21). NmU, originally named
because of its potent uterine contraction-inducing activity,
is synthesized as a 174 amino acid precursor and cleaved to a
25 amino acid biologically active peptide. Two G-coupled
receptors for NmU have been identiﬁed, NmU-R1 (predominantly in the periphery, especially gastrointestinal tract)
and NmU-R2 (predominantly in central nervous system).
Evidence suggests a role for NmU in pain, stress, immunemediated inﬂammatory diseases, and feeding regulation (see
reviews: refs. 22, 23). A limited number of studies to date
have associated NmU with cancer; with conﬂicting observations depending on the cancer type. Although NmU has
never previously been associated with breast cancer or,
indeed, with any HER2-overexpressing cancers, our studies
point to a role for NmU as a biomarker for HER-targeted
drugs. In addition, NmU may serve as a new therapeutic
target to help block tumor growth and metastasis, circumvent primary or acquired resistance, and to add value to
HER-targeted therapies.

Materials and Methods

exposed, for 48 hours, to lapatinib (1 mmol/L), trastuzumab
(12.5 mg/mL), neratinib (0.5 mmol/L), or afatinib (0.5 mmol/L).
NmU knockdown and overexpression
Two NmU-speciﬁc siRNAs (designated NmU-1 and NmU-2;
s225456 and s21351, Ambion), and scrambled siRNA (Scr;
negative control; AM4611, Ambion; 30 nmol/L) was used.
Transient transfections were harvested 72 hours posttransfection for RNA and protein extraction. NmU full-length cDNA
and mock controls (plasmid lacking NmU cDNA) used were
of pcDNA3.1(þ). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used
for transfection following the manufacturer's instructions.
Stable transfectants were established by selecting with zeocin (50 mg/mL and 300 mg/mL for HCC1954 and SKBR3transfected cells, respectively; Invitrogen). For in vivo studies,
HCC1954-LR-LUCþ (i.e. acquired resistance cells) cells stably
expressing the luciferase gene (HCC1954-LR-LUCþ) were
transfected with shRNAs for NmU cloned in the pLKO.1 vector
(shRNA #1–#5; Open Biosystems, Cat. no.: RHS4080_NM006681). After verifying successful NmU protein knockdown
and conferred drug sensitivity in vitro, one (shRNA #1) variant
was selected for in vivo analysis. HCC1954-LR-LUCþ cells with
no NmU knockdown were used as a control.
Proliferation assays
Cells with acquired resistance compared with aged-parent
cells and NmU cDNA- versus mock-transfected cells (HCC1954
variants, 2  103 cells/well; SKBR3 variants, 5  103 cells/well)
were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 hours before drug additions. Subsequently, a range of concentrations for lapatinib,
neratinib, trastuzumab, or afatinib was added to the cells. Five
days later, proliferation was assessed using the acid phosphatase method.

Refer to Supplementary Materials and Methods for detail.
Cell culture and treatments
SKBR3, HCC1954, MDA-MB-361, and T47D cells, obtained
from ATCC, were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) with
10% FCS (PAA) and 1% L-glutamine. Trastuzumab-conditioned
(resistant) SKBR3 (SKBR3-TR) cells, and both SKBR3 and
HCC1954, lapatinib-resistant cells (SKBR3-LR and HCC1954LR), and neratinib-resistant cells (SKBR3-NR and HCC1954NR) resulted from continuously exposing cells to the respective
drug for over 6 months. To assess whether functional NmU
receptors are expressed on cells, SKBR3 and HCC1954 (1  106
cells) were seeded in a 25-cm2 ﬂask, allowed to attach overnight
and subsequently treated with 1 mmol/L of NmU-25 (Bachem)
for 24 to 48 hours. Cell lines were authenticated by short
tandem repeat proﬁling, tested for Mycoplasma quarterly, and
were impact tested before introducing into murine models.
These were most recently tested in December 2013/January
2014. Trastuzumab was obtained from St. Vincent's Hospital
(Dublin, Ireland). Lapatinib, neratinib, and afatinib were purchased from Sequoia Chemicals Ltd.
Short-term drug exposure assays
SKBR3 and HCC1954 cells were seeded (5  105 cells, 25-cm2
ﬂasks) and allowed to grow to 80% conﬂuency before being

Assessing effects of NmU siRNAs with HER-targeted drugs
Forty-eight hours following transfection with NmU-1, NmU2 siRNA, or Scr sequences, cells were exposed to their approximate IC50 concentrations of lapatinib. A ﬁxed concentration of
trastuzumab (15 mg/mL), neratinib (1 mmol/L), and afatinib
(0.5 mmol/L) was assessed for all four cell line variants.
qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from cell lines and conditioned
medium using Tri Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), and treated with
DNase enzymes. cDNA was prepared from 500 ng cell-derived
and 4 mL conditioned medium-derived total RNA, respectively.
NmU (Hs00183624_m1, ABI) was quantiﬁed using the threshold cycle (Ct) adjusting to the levels of b-actin (4352933E, ABI)
as endogenous control.
Immunoprecipitation
Primary antibody was added (2 mg/100 mL of cell extract) to
total cell protein (1 mg/mL; total volume of 100 mL), mixed and
incubated for 120 minutes at 4 C. Of note, 20 mL of 50% protein
A agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cell extract
mix and incubated for 60 minutes at 4 C. This mixture was
centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The beads were washed
ﬁve times with the cold Lysis buffer and centrifuged at 5,000

rpm for 2 minutes. The beads were resuspended in 20 mL of
Laemmli's sample buffer, boiled for 5 minutes, and centrifuged
for 5 minutes. Subsequently, 18 mL of the samples were loaded
per lane in a SDS-PAGE.
Immunoblotting and ELISA
Total cellular proteins (30–40 mg, depending on the speciﬁc
protein's abundance; but constant for any given protein) were
resolved on 6% to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Millipore). Primary antibodies used included EGFR (Neomarker), HER2 (Calbiochem),
HSP27 (Enzo Life Sciences), NmU-R1 (Sigma-Aldrich), NmU-R2
(LifeSpan Biosciences), and b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) and proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence
(Millipore). Detection was performed with a Chemidoc exposure system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). An ELISA kit for NmU
(Peninsula Laboratories), HER2 (Calbiochem), and EGFR, pEGFR (R&D Systems) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Wound-healing assay
HCC1954-mock and NmU, HCC1954-LR associated Scr- or
siRNA-transfected cell variants (5  105 cells/well) and SKBR3mock and NmU variants (1  106 cells/well) were seeded on 6well plates and cultured for 48 hours to conﬂuency. Monolayer
was scratched with a pipette tip and the resulting wounded
areas were monitored by phase contrast microscopy and
determined using NIH ImageJ software.
Migration and invasion assay
Migration assays were performed using 8-mm pore size 24well Transwell chambers (BD Biosciences). For invasion
assessment, the inserts were precoated with ECM (SigmaAldrich). siRNA- or Scr-transfected cells, and NmU cDNAversus mock-transfected cells (HCC1954 variants, 1  105/
insert; SKBR3 variants, 1  106/insert) were seeded in the
upper compartment and allowed to migrate for 48 and 72
hours, respectively. Cells in the upper chamber were removed
and migrated/invaded cells were stained with crystal violet.
Staining was solubilized in 10% acetic acid, and read at 595 nm.
Anoikis assay
siRNA- or Scr-transfected cells, and NmU cDNA- versus
mock-transfected cells (HCC1954 variants, 1  105 cells/well;
SKBR3 variants, 1  104 cells/well) were seeded onto a 24-well
plates coated with Poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylic) acid (Sigma-Aldrich) or 95% ethanol and cultured for 24 and 48 hours,
respectively. Alamar Blue dye (100 mL; Serotec) was added/well
and absorbance read at 570 nm; reference wavelength, 600 nm.
Assessing potential clinical relevance of NmU in breast
cancer
NmU expression was evaluated in microarray datasets representing 3,489 breast tumors, including luminal A (n ¼ 1,521),
luminal B (n ¼ 676), HER2 (n ¼ 476), and basal (n ¼ 454)
molecular subtypes. Methods used for obtaining and collating

the data are detailed in Supplementary Materials and Methods
and Supplementary Table S1. All calculations were performed
in R (http://cran.r-project.org/).
In vivo analysis
All in vivo work reported was carried out at University
College Dublin (UCD, Dublin, Ireland), approved by the UCD
Animal research ethics committee and performed according to
local guidelines. BALB/c nu/nu mice (Charles River) were
implanted in the mammary fat pad with 10  106 HCC1954LR-LUC control (n ¼ 10) or HCC1954-LR-LUC-shRNA NmU
cells (n ¼ 20). Tumor growth was monitored by caliper
measurement and bioluminescence imaging (IVIS Spectrum,
PerkinElmar). Treatment was due to start once tumor volume
reached 200 mm2. When mice reached endpoint, they were
sacriﬁced and ex vivo imaging performed to detect any metastatic spread.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis on cell line– and conditioned mediumderived data was performed in Excel. P values were generated
using Student t tests, with P < 0.05 considered as statistically
signiﬁcant. GraphPad Prism 5.0 was used for graph generation
(GraphPad Software Inc).
All statistical analyses performed are detailed in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
Intracellular and extracellular NmU mRNA levels are
associated with acquired resistance to lapatinib
To identify extracellular as well as intracellular mRNAs that
may be associated with resistance to HER-targeted agents,
our initial analysis included HER2-overexpressing cell line
models, SKBR3 and HCC1954, and lapatinib-resistant (LR)
variant compared with their aged parent populations. Comparing the concentration of lapatinib that inhibits 50% of
proliferation (IC50) for SKBR3 that had acquired resistance
(SKBR3-LR; IC50 ¼ 3 mmol/L) in relation to SKBR3 aged (-Ag)
cells (IC50 ¼ 0.09 mmol/L) as controls (and so termed SKBR3Ag), a 29.8  2.2–fold resistance to lapatinib was observed.
For HCC1954 cells, a similar trend was observed with a 19.1 
2.8–fold resistance to lapatinib in HCC1954-LR (IC50 ¼ 5
mmol/L) compared with its age-matched population,
HCC1954-Ag (IC50 ¼ 0.3 mmol/L; Fig. 1A).
Evaluating mRNAs in medium conditioned by SKBR3-LR
and HCC1954-LR cells, compared with conditioned medium
from their age-matched control cell lines, indicated signiﬁcantly higher levels of extracellular NmU to be associated with
lapatinib resistance. This observation was validated by qPCR in
conditioned medium from these cells (Fig. 1B, i and ii). The
trend of increased NmU mRNA levels observed in conditioned
medium from the resistant cells compared with the sensitive
cell lines was subsequently found to reﬂect that in the corresponding cells (Fig. 1B, iii and iv).
Investigating whether the induced expression of NmU may
be an early response to drug exposure, we treated cells with
lapatinib (1 mmol/L) for 48 hours and assessed NmU levels by
qPCR. Here, we found that the levels of NmU mRNA detectable

in conditioned medium from the lapatinib-exposed SKBR3 and
HCC1954 cells (Fig. 1C, i and ii) were signiﬁcantly higher than
in the corresponding untreated control conditioned medium,
even after this relatively short-term exposure to drug. As
expected, a similar trend was found in the corresponding cells
(Fig. 1C, iii and iv). Considering a broader range of HERtargeted drugs, treating cells (HCC1954 as example) for 48
hours with trastuzumab (12.5 mg/mL) resulted in induced
NmU mRNA levels in conditioned medium (3.9  1–fold;
P ¼ 0.04) and corresponding cells (3.9  1.15–fold; P ¼ 0.06; Fig.
1D, i and ii). In relation to neratinib (0.5 mmol/L), the resulting
induced NmU mRNA was 3.6  1–fold (P ¼ 0.07) and 3.6 
0.54–fold (P ¼ 0.009) for conditioned medium and cells,
respectively (Fig. 1D, iii and iv).The levels of induced NmU
mRNA for afatinib (0.5 mmol/L) was 3.3  0.49–fold (P ¼ 0.01)

in conditioned medium and 3  0.38–fold (P ¼ 0.006) in cells
(Fig. 1D, v and vi).
Induced NmU protein expression occurs in cells with
acquired resistance to other HER-targeted agents and is
not restricted to lapatinib
We questioned whether the changes at the mRNA level in
acquired-resistant cells translated to NmU protein. In agreement with our mRNA observations, NmU protein levels were
signiﬁcantly higher in lapatinib-conditioned cells (SKBR3-LR
and HCC1954-LR) compared with their age-matched control
cells (SKBR3-Ag and HCC1954-Ag; Fig. 2A, i and ii). Interestingly, this observation was not limited to lapatinib, but was also
found in relation to other HER-targeted drugs where acquired
resistance populations were available. Speciﬁcally, a similar

Figure 2. Increased NmU protein expression in cells with acquired-resistance to lapatinib, trastuzumab, and neratinib; also in cells with innate
resistance to HER-targeting drugs. A, i, higher levels of NmU protein, analyzed by ELISA, were also found in lapatinib-resistant (SKBR3-LR),
trastuzumab-resistant (SKBR3-TR), and neratinib-resistant (SKBR3-NR) cells compared with the corresponding SKBR3-Ag cells. ii, for HCC1954,
the same trend was found with lapatinib-resistant (HCC1954-LR) and neratinib-resistant (HCC1954-NR) cells compared with their control
HCC1954-Ag cells. Data presented here are NmU protein quantity relative to the amount in the aged control (100%) population. B, increased levels
of NmU protein were also associated with innate resistance to HER-targeted drugs. Results represent biologic repeats n ¼ 3  SEM, where

trend (i.e., signiﬁcantly increased NmU protein levels) was
observed when we compared our trastuzumab-resistant
(SKBR3-TR or -TR) and neratinib-resistant (SKBR3-NR or -NR)
cells with their age-matched control cells (SKBR3-Ag; Fig. 2A, i)
and our neratinib-resistant HCC1954 (HCC1954-NR or -NR)
cells with their age-matched cells (HCC1954-Ag; Fig. 2A, ii).

Endogenous NmU protein levels may be associated with
innate sensitivity/resistance to HER-targeting drugs
SKBR3 cells are sensitive to both lapatinib and trastuzumab;
HCC1954 cells are sensitive to lapatinib but resistant to
trastuzumab; conversely, MDA-MB-361 is resistant to lapatinib, but sensitive to trastuzumab (24). Although T47D is
described as having normal HER2 expression (25), it is also
unresponsive to both drugs (26, 27), and so we elected to
include these in our analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, endogenous
levels of NmU protein appeared to correlate with the innate
sensitivity versus resistance proﬁle of these four cell lines.

NmU expression is prognostic for poor outcome in breast
cancer, particularly for HER2-positive and luminal A
subtypes
To determine whether NmU has relevance in human
breast cancer rather than being solely a cell line/conditioned
medium-related observation, we collated and mined microarray data relating to 3,489 breast tumors. Kaplan–Meier
estimates of survival (Fig. 3A) indicated high levels of NmU
expression to be associated with poor outcome for patients
with breast cancer (P < 1e-14). Considering each of the
breast cancer molecular subtypes within this general population of breast tumors, we found NmU expression to be
particularly associated with poor outcome for those patients
who had HER2-positive tumors (Fig. 3B; P < 5e-6) and
luminal A tumors (Fig. 3C; P < 8e-6). These associations
were not signiﬁcant with luminal B (Fig. 3D; P ¼ 0.081) or
basal-like (Fig. 3E; P ¼ 0.456) tumors.
Although complete clinicopathological information was
unavailable for all 3,489 patients, multivariate analysis

Figure 3. NmU expression is prognostic for poor outcome for patients with breast cancer, particularly within the HER2-positive and luminal A
molecular subtypes. A, Kaplan–Meier estimates indicate that high levels of NmU are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer (n ¼ 3,489). The
association of NmU expression with patients outcome in relation to each breast cancer molecular subtype was subsequently investigated and shown to be
signiﬁcant for HER2-positive (n ¼ 476; B) and luminal A (n ¼ 1,521; C) tumors but not luminal B (n ¼ 676; D) and basal like (n ¼ 454; E). F, multivariate
analysis reporting on NmU following adjustment for a range of established clinicopathological parameters indicated its independence as a poor
prognostic biomarker.

correcting for tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor status,
lymph node status, and age of patient, where this information was available, conﬁrmed NmU as an independent prognostic biomarker rather than it being simply a surrogate for
an already established parameter (Fig. 3F). Speciﬁcally,
considering all tumor types where information on these
ﬁve parameters was available (n ¼ 966), high levels of NmU
expression was associated with poor outcome (P ¼ 0.007;
HR ¼ 1.4). Considering the HER2-overexpressing subtype,
which is particularly relevant to this study, detailed clinical
information was available for only 95 patients. Following
correction, high levels of NmU in HER2-overexpressing
tumors tended toward statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.07;
HR ¼ 2.1). As information on tumor grade and lymph node
status was available for a substantial number of the HER2overexpressing tumors (n ¼ 360 specimens), we evaluated
NmU in this cohort and found it to be independently

NmU affects sensitivity to lapatinib, trastuzumab,
neratinib, and afatinib
To assess whether NmU might be functionally involved
in resistance to HER-targeted drugs, we stably transfected NmU cDNA into SKBR3 and HCC1954 parent cells and
established successful overexpression of NmU compared
with levels in mock-transfected cells, using both qPCR
and ELISA (Fig. 4A, i and ii). For all drugs tested, that is,
lapatinib (Fig. 4B, i), trastuzumab (Fig. 4B, ii), neratinib
(Fig. 4B, iii), and afatinib (Fig. 4B, iv), the resulting antiproliferative effects were signiﬁcantly compromised in the
NmU-transfected cells compared with the mock-transfected
cells. The exception to this being the response of HCC1954NmU to trastuzumab (Fig. 4B, ii).

and protein (ELISA) were conﬁrmed in SKBR3 (i) and HCC1954 (ii) cells compared with mock-transfected populations. B, comparative inﬂuences

To further explore a functional role for NmU in resistance to
HER-targeted drugs, NmU was subsequently knocked down in
both our acquired resistant cell lines (SKBR3-LR and HCC1954LR) and innately resistant/unresponsive cells (MDA-MB-361
and T47D). Again, qPCR and ELISAs established signiﬁcant
knockdown of NmU mRNA as shown in Fig. 5, i and protein
Fig. 5, ii, respectively, compared with levels in scrambled (Scr)
control cells. In relation to effects on response to drug, while
some variation was observed between cell lines and siRNAs,
NmU knockdown (compared with scrambled control, Scr) was
found to increase the antiproliferative effects achieved in
response to all of the four HER2 drugs tested (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S2A and S2B).
Proposed mechanism-of-action
We next investigated how NmU knockdown may be
enhancing the effects of this range of HER-targeted drugs.
As HER2 is a target for all four drugs and EGFR is also a target
of lapatinib, neratinib, and afatinib, we assessed the levels of

www.aacrjournals.org

these speciﬁc targets—their total amounts and their phosphorylated forms—using ELISAs and immunoblotting. Of
great interest, with both SKBR3-LR and HCC1954-LR cells,
NmU knockdown was associated with signiﬁcantly reduced
levels of total HER2 protein (Fig. 6A, i and ii).
By mining the literature, we found that HSP27 has previously
been reported as highly expressed in HER2-positive breast
cancer (28) and, importantly, has been recognized as reducing
cellular trastuzumab susceptibility by directly binding to HER2
and thus increasing its stability (29). We hypothesized, therefore, that HSP27 may be the linking molecule in this chain of
events facilitating the mechanism by which NmU contributes
resistance to HER-targeted drugs. To investigate this, NmU was
immunoprecipitated and assessed by immunoblotting for
HSP27 binding. NmU immunoprecipitation did, indeed, pull
HSP27 out and further increased levels of the NmU:HSP27
complex were observed in NmU over-expressing (HER drug
resistant) cell lines variants compared with their sensitive
mock-transfected parent lines (Fig. 6B, i and ii). Subsequently,

Figure 5. Conﬁrmation of NmU knockdown by siRNAs. Following transfection with two NmU-siRNA (NmU-1 or NmU-2) or scrambled sequence
(Scr), levels of NmU mRNA (qPCR; ii) and protein (ELISA; ii) showed partial knockdown of NmU expression in both the acquired lapatinib-resistant
SKBR3-LR, HCC1954-LR, innately unresponsive T47D, and MDA-MB-361 cells. Results represent n ¼ 3  SEM, where  , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;

knockdown of NmU in lapatinib-resistant SKBR3-LR and
HCC1954-LR (Fig. 6C, i and ii) demonstrated relative decreased
levels of HSP27. A proposed model of this mechanism of action
is outlined (Fig. 6D, i–ii).
Upon NmU silencing, the total amounts of EGFR present was
not signiﬁcantly affected in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
S1A, i and ii), but phosphorylation of the EGFR that was present
was signiﬁcantly reduced (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To further explore the functional role of NmU, after establishing that both NmU receptors (NmU-R1 and NmU-R2) are
expressed by SKBR3 and HCC1954 cells, we observed that
treating these cells with exogenous NmU (NmU-25) induced
expression of both HER2 and EGFR proteins (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). This suggests that either or both of NmU-R1 and
NmU-R2 are functionally active on these cells. Interestingly,
exposure to exogenous NmU also induced a low, but signiﬁcant, level of resistance to lapatinib (SKBR3, P ¼ 0.004;
HCC1954, P ¼ 0.00004), trastuzumab (SKBR3, P ¼ 0.003;
HCC1954, P ¼ 0.000002), neratinib (SKBR3, P ¼ 0.005;
HCC1954, P ¼ 0.01), and afatinib (SKBR3, P ¼ 0.002; HCC1954,
P ¼ 0.0017) in both SKBR3 and HCC1954 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
NmU expression is also associated with other phenotypic
characteristics, including cell motility, invasion, and
resistance to anoikis
To assess what other functional role(s) NmU may have,
NmU-overexpressing and NmU knockdown cells were further
evaluated. Events associated with more "aggressive" cancers
include the ability of the cells to move (migration assays),
digest, and migrate through extracellular matrix during intravasation and extravasation (invasion assays) and to survive in
suspension, as necessary to survive in the peripheral circulation en route to metastasize (anoikis assays). NmU cDNA

3828

overexpression in HCC1954 compared with HCC1954-mock
was associated with increased motility as evaluated by wound
healing (Supplementary Fig. S3A, i), increased migration
through Transwell (Supplementary Fig. S3B, i), increased invasion through extracellular matrix-coated Transwells (Supplementary Fig. S3C, i), and resistance to anoikis (Supplementary
Fig. S3D, i). Conversely, NmU knockdown in HCC1954-LR was
associated with opposite effects, that is, decreased cellular
motility (Supplementary Fig. S3A, ii), decreased migration
(Supplementary Fig. S3B, ii), decreased invasion (Supplementary Fig. S3C, ii), and increased sensitivity to cell death by
anoikis (Supplementary Fig. S3D, i; representative NmU cDNA
transfected in SKBR3 results are summarized in Supplementary Fig. S4).
In vivo, NmU knockdown reduced tumor growth and
metastasis
To establish the relevance of NmU in the orthotopic in vivo
setting, HER drug-resistant HCC1954-LR cells that expressed
luciferase underwent NmU knockdown in vitro and were subsequently injected into the mammary fat pad of immunocompromised animals. As indicated in Fig. 7A, orthotropic growth of
HCC1954-LR shRNA NmU knockdown (NmU) tumors was
signiﬁcantly impaired relative to control (P ¼ 0.0056). This is
indicated by representative bioluminescence images taken at
day 56 (Fig. 7B). Within the timeframe of the current study (65
days), tumors from 7 of 10 of the control animals had reached
endpoint (15 mm diameter), and animals sacriﬁced. Metastatic
lesions were found in the lymph nodes, liver, and lungs (Fig. 7C
and D). At this time (day 65), only 2 of 20 animals bearing
HCC1954-LR NmU reached endpoint. In these animals at time
of sacriﬁce, metastatic lesions were found in the liver and lungs,
but not in the lymph nodes. Tumors in the remaining 18 of 20
animals were signiﬁcantly below endpoint diameter with no

Discussion
NmU has previously been associated with cancer, but an
association between NmU and breast cancer or with HER2
overexpression in any cancer type has not previously been
established. Speciﬁcally, in typically small studies of acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML; ref. 30), ovarian (31), pancreatic
(32), lung (33), bladder (34), and renal cancer (35), NmU has
been associated with oncogenic characteristics. Conversely,
preliminary studies of esophageal (36) and oral (37) cancers

www.aacrjournals.org

suggest tumor suppressor activities. Here, we report that
increased NmU mRNA expression is signiﬁcantly associated
with poor outcome in breast cancer; particularly for those
patients with HER2 or luminal A tumors. Our data also suggest
that NmU expression has independence as a prognostic factor
for poor outcome and is not simply a surrogate for an already
established prognostic biomarker.
Our initial observation of NmU being associated with resistance to HER-targeting drugs was made through analysis of
medium conditioned by cells that had acquired lapatinib
resistance compared with conditioned medium from their
respective aged parent populations. This observation reﬂected

Figure 6. NmU's mechanism-of-action involves complexing with its partner protein HSP27, increasing HER2 stability thus inducing resistance. NmU
siRNA knockdown in both SKBR3-LR and HCC1954-LR cells was associated with signiﬁcantly reduced levels of HER2 protein (A), as shown by ELISA (i)
and immunoblotting (ii). Immunoprecipitation of NmU in NmU-overexpressing cells, compared with mock-transfected cells, was associated with signiﬁcantly
increased levels of HSP27 (B) as shown by immunoblotting (i) and corresponding densitometry (ii). NmU siRNA knockdown in both SKBR3-LR and HCC1954LR cells was associated with signiﬁcantly reduced levels of HSP27 protein (C), as shown by immunoblotting (i) and corresponding densitometry (ii). D, our

that of the cells themselves. This is in keeping with our previous
observations from a range of cell lines (16, 17, 19) and pilot
study analysis of serum and corresponding tumor tissue from
patients with breast cancer (18). These ﬁndings indicate that
full-length mRNAs can be selectively expelled from cells.
Similar observations, studying different mRNAs, have been
reported by others (38). To further explore whether or not the
response of increased intracellular and extracellular NmU
mRNA is an early event, sensitive cells (SKBR3 and HCC1954
parent cells) were exposed to lapatinib short term, showing
some increased NmU mRNA transcription and expulsion from
cells within this time frame. To establish whether the increase
in NmU levels (intracellular and extracellular) is speciﬁc to
lapatinib or whether NmU mRNA may have relevance as a

3830

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

biomarker of response to other HER-targeting drugs, our
analysis was expanded to also investigate the response to
trastuzumab, neratinib, and afatinib. In all cases, increased
transcription and expulsion of NmU mRNA resulted. The lower
fold changes observed in conditioned medium compared with
cells may suggest that this is not a dynamic event; that cells
limit the amount of mRNAs they select to send out into the
extracellular environment; and/or that some of extracellular
mRNA was degraded. However, the NmU mRNA levels in
conditioned medium from resistant cells were always significantly higher than that in conditioned medium from sensitive
cells and evidence suggests that this effect is partly an early
event; albeit the levels detected in short-term treated cells were
not as enhanced as that in acquired resistance cells. This

observation of NmU as a potential extracellular, as well as
intracellular, predictive biomarker (while not the main focus
on this manuscript) warrants further investigation.
For a more comprehensive understanding, we also elected to
expand these studies to evaluate NmU protein, in addition to
mRNA. Considering innately sensitive and resistant cells, here
we found NmU protein levels to correlate with innate resistance versus sensitivity to HER-targeting drugs, that is, with the
low levels in SKBR3 (sensitive to trastuzumab and lapatinib)
progressive increasing in HCC1954 and MDA-MB-361 (resistant to one or other of these drugs) and at highest levels in
T47D (unresponsive to both HER-targeted drugs considered
here) cells. Furthermore, in relation to acquired resistance,

www.aacrjournals.org

NmU proteins level were always found to be signiﬁcantly
higher in cells with acquired resistance to lapatinib, trastuzumab, and neratinib compared with their aged control populations. This suggests that NmU protein, as well as its mRNA,
potentially has broad application as a predictive biomarker for
response to HER-targeted drugs.
Investigating a functional role of NmU in relation to HER
targeting, our overexpression (in sensitive cells) and knockdown (in both acquired-resistant and innately-resistant cells)
studies showed NmU levels to inversely correlate with cellular
response to all four HER-targeting drugs tested. Speciﬁcally,
NmU overexpression generally conferred resistance to the
antiproliferative effects of all drugs tested. (The exception to

this was the HCC1954 cells, where NmU overexpression did not
affect response to trastuzumab. This is likely to be due to the
fact that HCC1954 are innately resistant to trastuzumab;
ref. 24). Our NmU immunoprecipitation and associated investigations to identify the direct mechanism by which NmU is
acting and thus conferring resistance to these drugs indicated
NmU to directly partner with HSP27. By directly binding to
HER2, HSP27 has previously been shown to increase HER2
stability and thus reduce cellular sensitivity to this drug (29).
This is also in keeping with our observation of knock-on effects
of NmU expression increasing HER2 protein levels.
Conversely, although there were some differences between
cell lines and effectiveness of the two NmU siRNAs used, NmU
knockdown added substantially to the antiproliferative effects
of lapatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib, and afatinib in both
innately- and acquired-resistant cell lines studied. Interestingly, this knockdown in NmU was directly associated with
subsequent reduced expression of its identiﬁed partner HSP27,
HER2, protein and the phosphorylated/activated form of
EGFR, the latter possibly being a consequence of a reduced
transactivation by HER2. Of note, NmU knockdown also
resulted in increased sensitivity of T47D cells to all four drugs
despite the fact that T47D cells express normal levels of HER2,
that is, T47D is not a HER2-overexpressing cell line (25). As
sensitivity to these drugs (targeting HER2 for all four drugs;
also EGFR for lapatinib, neratinib, and afatinib) was directly
affected by the relatively modest NmU knockdown (up to 40%
achieved with siRNA), this suggests that cotargeting NmU,
while targeting HER2/EGFR, may help circumvent resistance
to these drugs.
In keeping with our hypothesis that NmU is involved in
regulating response to HER-targeted drugs, treating sensitive
HER2-overexpressing cells (SKBR3 and HCC1954) with exogenous NmU was found to slightly, but signiﬁcantly, reduce the
antiproliferative effects of lapatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib,
and afatinib, in association with increased expression of HER2
and EGFR receptors.
The potential beneﬁts of targeting/cotargeting NmU in
HER2 breast cancer is further supported by our observations
that NmU knockdown signiﬁcantly decreases migration/
motility, invasion, and resistance to anoikis, whereas its overexpression has the opposite effects. Importantly, in vivo studies
implementing an orthotropic model of HER2-positive tumors
resistant to lapatinib (and to other HER-targeted drugs) further supports this, as NmU stable knockdown dramatically

impaired tumor growth and metastatic spread. These observations of NmU being associated with more "aggressive" phenotypic characteristics of cancer cells concur with the reports of
NmU being associated with oncogenic characteristics in other
cancer types, including AML, pancreatic, ovarian, lung, and
bladder cancers (30–32, 35).
In conclusion, here we provide evidence that NmU is associated with poor outcome from breast cancer, particularly
being prognostic of unfavorable outcome for patients with
HER2-overexpressing tumors; that it has potential as a predictive biomarker of response to a broad range of HER-targeting drugs; and that it is mechanistically involved in conferring
this resistance by working in concert with its partner protein
HSP27. Our results provide a strong rationale for more extensive analysis of NmU as a companion biomarker for HERtargeted drugs and as a cotarget to help circumvent resistance
and thus add value to these drugs.
