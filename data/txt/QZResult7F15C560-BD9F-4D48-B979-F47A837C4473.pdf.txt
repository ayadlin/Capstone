Pseudopodial Actin Dynamics Control EpithelialMesenchymal Transition in Metastatic Cancer Cells

Abstract
A key cellular process associated with the invasive or metastatic program in many cancers is the transformation of epithelial cells toward a mesenchymal state, a process called epithelial to mesenchymal transition
or EMT. Actin-dependent protrusion of cell pseudopodia is a critical element of mesenchymal cell migration
and therefore of cancer metastasis. However, whether EMT occurs in human cancers and, in particular,
whether it is a prerequisite for tumor cell invasion and metastasis, remains a subject of debate. Microarray
and proteomic analysis of actin-rich pseudopodia from six metastatic human tumor cell lines identified 384
mRNAs and 64 proteins common to the pseudopodia of six metastatic human tumor cell lines of various
cancer origins leading to the characterization of 19 common pseudopod-specific proteins. Four of these
(AHNAK, septin-9, eIF4E, and S100A11) are shown to be essential for pseudopod protrusion and tumor cell
migration and invasion. Knockdown of each of these proteins in metastatic cells resulted in reduced actin
cytoskeleton dynamics and induction of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) that could be prevented
by the stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton. Actin-dependent pseudopodial protrusion and tumor cell
migration are therefore determinants of EMT. Protein regulators of pseudopodial actin dynamics may
represent unique molecular targets to induce MET and thereby inhibit the metastatic potential of tumor cells.

Introduction
Tumor progression is a complex process that invokes multimodal parameters that enable tumor cells to evade host defense mechanisms and to migrate and establish new colonies
or metastases. Dynamic actin cytoskeleton remodeling and
stabilization of de novo substrate contacts drive pseudopodial protrusion and represent the basic mechanism by which
cells migrate (1). Pseudopodial protrusion, and the formation
of related invadopodia, has long been associated with tumor
cell migration and invasion (2, 3). Expression of regulators of
local actin reorganization critical for pseudopod protrusion,
such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family proteins,
the Arp2/3 complex, Eps 8, α-actinin, fascin, filamin, LIMkinase/cofilin, and cortactin, are closely associated with tumor
cell migration and invasion and overexpressed in various

cancers (4, 5). Actin cytoskeleton regulators were also recently identified as critical determinants of lymphoma progression in a loss-of-function RNA screen of mouse tumor
models (6). Increased expression of Arp2/3 and WAVE2 correlates with poor prognosis in breast and liver carcinomas
underlining the relevance of actin-dependent membrane protrusion and pseudopodia formation in cancer progression
(7, 8). Cytokine activation stimulates intracellular signaling
pathways that regulate the local reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton at the leading edge and drive pseudopodial protrusion (9–11). Proteins required for pseudopodial extension
may therefore represent potential therapeutic targets to suppress tumor cell invasion and metastasis.
A key cellular process associated with the invasive or metastatic program in many cancers is the transformation of
epithelial cells toward a mesenchymal state, a process called
epithelial to mesenchymal transition or EMT (12). EMT is
associated with altered gene expression patterns resulting
in the loss of E-cadherin and the breakdown of cell-cell junctions as well as the acquisition of a fibroblastic morphology
including polarized actin cytoskeleton assembly into protrusive and invasive pseudopodial structures. Mesenchymal
transition enables invasive cells to break away from the invasive front, switch from collective to individual migration/
invasion programmes, and navigate through the extracellular
matrix and into the vasculature (13–15). However, although
EMT is closely associated with the formation of protrusive
pseudopodial structures, the relationship between pseudopod formation and EMT has yet to be characterized.

Actin Regulates EMT in Metastatic Cancer Cells

Molecular characterization of purified pseudopodial
domains of fibroblasts, neurons, and cancer cells has led to
the characterization of various populations of pseudopodenriched RNAs and proteins (16–21). However, a comprehensive analysis of the mRNA and protein composition of
pseudopodia of metastatic human cancer cells has yet to be
undertaken. We report here the transcriptome/proteome
analysis of six metastatic human tumor cell lines and identify
four tumor cell pseudopod–specific proteins (AHNAK,
Septin-9, eIF4E, and S100A11) whose expression is critical
for pseudopod protrusion, actin cytoskeleton dynamics,
and tumor cell migration and invasion. Of particular interest, loss of each of these proteins reverses EMT in these
highly metastatic cell lines and results in cell-cell interaction, expression of E-cadherin, and reduced migration and
invasion. Molecular effectors required for actin cytoskeleton
dynamics and pseudopodial protrusions are therefore critical regulators of EMT and metastatic progression.

24 h for MDA231, HT1080, and Du145) posttransfection
and treated with different optimized jasplakinolide concentrations (U251, 50 nm; MDA231, 100 nm; HT1080/Du145,
150 nm) for 2 hours. Targeted protein knockdown was assessed by Western blot and F-actin distribution by immunofluorescence.

Results
Identification of pseudopod-localized gene products.
Plating cells on 1-μm pore filters selectively allows the passage of actin-rich protrusions but not nuclei or the cell
body through the filter pores (19, 25). Six metastatic tumor
cell lines (breast MDA-231 and MDA-435, prostate Du145,
fibrosarcoma HT1080, and glioma U251 and U87) that project
actin-rich pseudopodia through 1-μm pore diameter polycarbonate filters were selected for further study (Fig. 1A).
In all cases, nuclei were retained on the upper surface of the
filter (Fig. 1A). Lysates were prepared from the upper cell
body and lower pseudopod fractions, and as an indication
of pseudopod fraction purity, Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of actin but not the mitochondrial
Hsp70 protein in the pseudopod fraction from all six tumor
cell lines (Fig. 1A). Pseudopod and cell body mRNA fractions
were prepared from the six cell lines and analyzed by
Affymetrix microarray analysis. Of the >23,000 genes analyzed, only 384 genes presented an absolute change >1.6-fold
enrichment of mRNA expression in the pseudopod fraction
relative to the cell body in all the cell lines (Supplementary
Table S1; Fig. 1B). Proteomic analysis of the pseudopod

fraction identified <200 proteins enriched in the pseudopodia of each cell line and 64 proteins common to all the tumor cell pseudopodia (Fig. 1B). Network analysis using the
Ingenuity software showed that the cohort of pseudopodial
mRNAs and proteins in each cell line as well as the common
pseudopod-enriched cohorts were highly relevant to cancer
(Fig. 1C).
We identified 19 pseudopod genes whose RNA was upregulated by microarray analysis in the pseudopod fraction of
all six cell lines and was present by proteomic analysis in at
least three cell lines (Supplementary Table S2). Of these, we
chose desmoyokin (AHNAK nucleoprotein), prothymosin-α,
ribosomal protein L23 (RPL23), septin-9, and calgizzarin
(S100A11) for further study. We also included eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) that, although not
among the pseudopod enriched mRNAs, was identified in
the proteomic analysis of four cell lines (Supplementary
Table S2) and has a well-characterized role in tumor progression and metastasis (26). As controls, we selected two cell
body–enriched mRNAs (rhotekin G and calsequestrin S) and
RDIF-α whose mRNA was pseudopod enriched but was not
detected in the proteomic analysis.
We validated the pseudopodial distribution of mRNA and
protein for the selected proteins by qPCR and Western blot,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Septin-9 and
eIF4E mRNA were significantly enriched in the pseudopodia
of six cell lines, and prothymosin α and S100A11 mRNA were
enriched in the pseudopodia of two to three of the metastatic cell lines studied. Of the three cell body–enriched
genes selected, only rhotekin G mRNA was confirmed to be
cell body–enriched. However, at the protein level, clear enrichment of AHNAK, S100A11, septin 9, eIF4E, and prothymosin α was detected in pseudopod fractions of essentially
all the cell lines studied. Similarly, calsequestrin, rhotekin G,
and RDIF-α were all clearly enriched in the cell body fractions by Western blot (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Only
RPL23 showed no clear distribution to either the cell body
or pseudopod fractions.
The pseudopod distribution of the identified proteins was
further assessed by immunofluorescent labeling of the six
metastatic cell lines with specific antibodies and counterstaining F-actin with phalloidin. Representative labeling
of MDA-231 cells (Fig. 2) shows that AHNAK, eIF4E,
S100A11, and septin-9 were predominantly localized in the
peripheral actin-rich pseudopodial domain. Prothymosin α,

Methods and immunofluorescently labeled for AHNAK, eIF4E, S100A11, and septin 9 (green) and with rhodamine phallodin to label F-actin (red).

EMT marker expression. D, cells transfected with control or pseudopod protein–specific siRNA and treated or not with JP were immunofluorescently labeled
for Smad1/2/3 or SNAI1 and Hoechst for nuclear staining. Nuclear distribution of Smad1/2/3 and SNAI1 was scored for control and specific
siRNA-transfected cells (% positive nuclei; n = 4; columns, mean; bars, SEM). Scale bar, 10 μm.

RDIF-α, calsequestrin S, RPL23, and rhotekin G were distributed throughout the cell and exhibited reduced colocalization with F-actin (Fig. 2). As seen in Fig. 2B, AHNAK,
eIF4E, S100A11, and septin-9 showed a higher colocalization
coefficient relative to F-actin compared with the other
proteins across all the cell lines, except for S100A11 in
MDA-435 cells. In all cases, colocalization with F-actin
was significantly elevated relative to rhotekin G/F-actin colocalization. Extension of this analysis to six other pseudopod-enriched proteins (UBE2V2, TPM4, HNRPL1, YWHAE,
COTL1, and SET; Table 1) confirmed that all except
HNRPL1 were enriched in tumor cell pseudopodia by Western blot and UBE2V2, TPM4, YWHAE, and COTL1 by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). This
domain-specific gene array and proteomic strategy across
six metastatic cell lines of various tissue origins has therefore led to the identification of a cohort of pseudopodenriched proteins of potential relevance to tumor cell
migration and metastasis.
Pseudopod protein knockdown reduces cell spreading,
migration, and invasion, and reverts EMT. To study the
functional role of pseudopod-enriched proteins in tumor cell
migration, we used a siRNA knockdown approach focusing
on AHNAK, eIF4E, S100A11, and septin-9. Transient transfection of the six metastatic cell lines with target-specific
siRNA resulted in the individual knockdown of protein level
for AHNAK, eIF4E, S100A11, and septin-9 by >90% after
48 hours of transfection compared with control nontransfected and scrambled siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3A and
B). Interestingly, knockdown of each of these four proteins
did not affect the expression or distribution of the other
three pseudopod-specific proteins that remained localized
with the cortical actin cytoskeleton at the cell periphery
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Individual knockdown of each of
these four pseudopod-specific proteins resulted in dramatically reduced cell spreading and induced cell rounding relative to untransfected cells. Quantification using a Cellomics
ArrayScan reader showed a >2-fold reduction in cell size and
shape upon siRNA knockdown of all four proteins (Fig. 3A
and C). The increased cell rounding was indicative of a loss
of cellular protrusions and this was confirmed by the dramatic reduction in the number of actin-rich pseudopodia
that protruded through 1-μm pores upon individual knockdown of the four pseudopod proteins (Fig. 3C), supporting a
functional role for these proteins in pseudopod formation.
Reduced cell spreading and pseudopod formation upon
knockdown of each of the four pseudopod-specific proteins
suggested that these proteins also regulate cell migration and
invasion. Indeed, knockdown of these proteins dramatically
reduced migration in a Boyden chamber assay and invasion
in Matrigel invasion chambers compared with cells transfected with control siRNA or nontransfected wild-type cells.
However, no difference in viability of siRNA knockdown cells
was detected (Fig. 3C). This result is consistent with a specific role for these pseudopodial proteins in tumor cell migration and invasion.
Of particular interest, knockdown of the four pseudopodial
proteins was associated with de novo expression of E-cadherin

3788

that concentrated at sites of cell-cell interaction (Fig. 4) and
redistribution of nuclear β-catenin from the nuclear region
to peripheral junctional sites (Fig. 4). Knockdown was also associated with the loss of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin
and vimentin in all the cell lines except MDA-231 and DU145
cells that showed no expression of N-cadherin to begin with
(Fig. 4). These results are consistent with a required role for
each of these pseudopodial proteins in the induction of EMT.
Real-time PCR also identified the increased expression of ECadherin mRNA upon knockdown of these four proteins in
all the cell lines except for MDA-231 cells (Fig. 5A). Finally,
Smad1/2/3 and SNAI1, transcription factors whose nuclear
expression is associated with EMT (27), are nuclear localized in the metastatic cells studied but redistributed to
the cytoplasm of knockdown cells, confirming the reversion
of EMT upon knockdown of the four pseudopodial proteins
(Fig. 5B).
Regulation of EMT by pseudopodial actin dynamics.
Concentration of these proteins within actin-rich pseudopodia led us to test if knockdown of these proteins impacts on
actin cytoskeleton dynamics. We treated control or siRNAtransfected MDA-231 and HT1080 cells with latrunculin-A
(Lat-A), an inhibitor of actin polymerization, and measured
the loss of F-actin density over time by phalloidin labeling.
Knockdown cells for all four pseudopod-enriched proteins
display reduced F-actin density, both before and after LatA treatment, and a slower loss of F-actin in the presence of
Lat-A relative to nontreated or control siRNA-transfected
cells (Fig. 6A). This suggests that each of these proteins function to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics.
Treatment of cells with the actin-stabilizing drug jasplakinolide prevented cell rounding and shrinking upon
knockdown of pseudopod proteins (Fig. 6B). Importantly,
in cells treated with jasplakinolide (U251, 50 nmol/L;
MDA-231, 100 nmol/L; DU145, HT1080, 150 nmol/L) for
the final 2 hours of siRNA treatment, pseudopod protein
knockdown no longer induced the expression of E-cadherin
or loss of expression of vimentin and N-cadherin (Fig. 6C).
Jasplakinolide pretreatment further inhibited cytoplasmic
translocation of the transcription factors Smad1/2/3 and
SNAI1 (Fig. 6D). Actin cytoskeleton dynamics therefore
plays a central role in the regulation of EMT by these pseudopodial proteins.

Discussion
Based on the fundamental requirement of pseudopod protrusion for tumor cell migration and metastasis, we used a
combined transcriptomics and proteomics approach to identify 19 pseudopod-specific proteins in six metastatic cell lines
of varying tumor origin, including breast, prostate, fibrosarcoma, and glioma. Knockdown of four pseudopod-enriched
proteins, AHNAK, septin-9, eIF4E, and S100A11, resulted in
pseudopod retraction, inhibition of cell migration and invasion, reduced actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and reversion of
EMT. Our data define a direct link between pseudopodial actin dynamics and EMT, and suggest that targeting molecules
crucial for pseudopod formation, such as those identified in

Actin Regulates EMT in Metastatic Cancer Cells

this study, might represent a means to revert EMT, inducing
mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), and potentially inhibiting tumor cell metastasis.
Ingenuity pathway analysis of the cohorts of pseudopodial
mRNAs and proteins in individual cell lines as well as those
common to all six metastatic cell lines showed a high degree
of cancer relevance (Fig. 1C). Expression of many of the 19
pseudopod-enriched proteins has been linked to various cancers. eIF4E has a well-established role in the progression of
multiple cancer types and is actively being assessed as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy (26, 28). Expression of septin
9 is associated with malignant brain tumors (29). Higher levels of S100A11 expression are associated with colorectal
cancer progression and invasion and metastasis of non–small
cell lung cancer (30, 31). AHNAK was originally identified in
neuroblastoma cancer cell lines; however, detailed study of
its role in human cancers remains limited (32). Several other
pseudopod-enriched proteins have also been reported to be
associated with cancer including COTL1, YWHAE, ATP
synthase, TPM4, SET, PTMA, and CNN2 (33–38). Importantly,
many of the identified proteins (Table 1), such as COTL1,
YWHAE, TPM4, CNN2, septin 9, AHNAK, S100A11, and eIF4E,
have well-defined associations with the actin cytoskeleton
(39–45). In addition, we also identified five ribosomal proteins (RPL11, RPL23, RPL6A, RPL13, and RPL27) that, together with pseudopodial enrichment of eIF4E, elongation
factor α (46), and various other proteins associated with
RNA translocation and protein translation (19), further supports actin-rich pseudopodia as sites of active protein translation. This domain-specific transcriptome and proteome
analysis across multiple metastatic cancer cells of various tissue origins has therefore resulted in the identification of
actin-associated proteins of potential cancer relevance.
Knockdown of each of these proteins reduces cellular F-actin
content, actin turnover rate, and pseudopodial protrusion
(Fig. 6), consistent with the established role of a dynamic actin cytoskeleton in pseudopod protrusion, as well as tumor
cell migration and invasion. This suggests that they all act
to promote pseudopod protrusion through a common mechanism associated with actin turnover and actin cytoskeleton
remodeling. Although the specific relevance of each of the
identified pseudopod-enriched proteins in cancer progression
remains to be determined, this study underlies the critical
importance of pseudopodial actin dynamics in the migratory
and invasive phenotypes critical to tumor metastasis.

The fact that depletion of these proteins results in the reversion of EMT is of particular interest and links pseudopodial actin dynamics to transitions between epithelial and
mesenchymal cell phenotypes. Indeed, the ability of actin stabilization with jasplakinolide to restore the expression of
EMT markers after pseudopod protein knockdown suggests
that a stable actin cytoskeleton is critical for EMT in cancer
cells. Pseudopod protrusion is observed upon ErbB2-driven
EMT in epithelial cells and may underlie increased invasiveness observed during EMT (47). E-cadherin binding to p120catenin plays a fundamental role in the stability of epithelial
cell-cell adhesions and regulates actin assembly required for
the formation of membrane protrusions (48). However, although membrane protrusion formation is associated with
EMT-driven cell invasion, there is to date no experimental
evidence directly linking EMT to pseudopod formation (49).
How pseudopodial actin dynamics are regulating EMT is unclear. However, the ability of a relatively short (2 hours) actin
stabilization with jasplakinode to revert MET suggests that it
is related not to transcriptional activity and gene regulation
but rather to the regulation of local protein turnover that
might be involved in the EMT process. That regulation of actin dynamics by both pseudopodial proteins and pharmacologic agents controls the expression of EMT markers defines
for the first time, to our knowledge, the critical role of actin
dynamics and pseudopodial protrusion and, therefore, the
acquisition of a motile, migratory phenotype, on the induction of EMT.
