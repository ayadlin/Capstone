Resuscitating Wild-Type p53 Expression by Disrupting
Ceramide Glycosylation: A Novel Approach to Target Mutant
p53 Tumors
Yong-Yu Liu

Abstract
Mutant p53 is frequently detected in cancers in which p53 has lost its ability in tumor suppression and gained
function in promoting tumor progression. Restoration of p53 functions by replacement of wild-type p53 and
inhibition of its degradation or increment of its transcriptional activity has been applied to the prevention and
treatment of cancers. Recent evidence indicates that disrupting ceramide glycosylation can resuscitate wild-type
p53 expression and p53-dependent apoptosis in mutant p53 tumors. A posttranscriptional process that can turn
on wild-type p53 expression and abrogate mutant p53 may provide a new strategy to eradicate mutant p53
cancers. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6295–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
p53 protein, encoded by the human gene TP53, is a key
tumor suppressor in preventing tumorigenesis and cancer
progression. As an essential transcriptional factor, p53 activates the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1, Bax, Puma, FAS, and other
p53-responsive genes, and consequently promotes cell-growth
arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell differentiation. These
cell processes remove damaged or transformed cells from
normal tissues (1). The transcriptional activity of p53 on p53responsive genes is sequence specific and relies mainly on its
DNA-binding domain (DBD, residues 102–292) encoded by the
sequence from exon 4 to exon 8 (1, 2). In normal cells, p53 is
tightly controlled and kept at a low level. A wide variety of
signals involved in DNA damage, oncogenic stress, hypoxia,
and cellular distress activate p53 primarily through posttranslational modifications that result in an augmented level of
p53 protein and its transactivation activity. Ubiquitin ligase
MDM2, which interacts with and recruits p53 to the ubiquitinproteasome, regulates p53 degradation (1, 3).
p53 function is compromised in most tumors as a result of
somatic TP53 mutations, followed by loss of heterozygosity
during the course of carcinogenesis (1, 4). The frequencies
of p53 mutations vary considerably among cancer types,
ranging from 10% in hematopoietic malignancies to 50% to
70% in ovarian, colorectal, and head and neck cancers (1, 4).
The majority of p53 mutants in human cancers abrogate
sequence-specific DNA binding to the promoter element of

the p53-responsive genes. Moreover, p53 mutants confer a
dominant-negative activity over the remaining wild-type allele
by functionally inactive hetero-oligomers of the mutants with
the wild-type protein (1, 3). Increasing evidence indicates that
many p53 mutants also gain new oncogenic properties that are
independent of wild-type p53 (1, 3). p53 mutants that promote tumor progression and resistance to therapies have
become the most common prognostic indicator of both tumor
recurrence and cancer death (1, 4, 5). Restoration of p53
function has been shown to achieve regression of tumors
and thus represents a potential approach to treat cancers
(1, 6). This review highlights resuscitation of wild-type p53
expression by targeting ceramide glycosylation, a novel
approach for eradicating mutant p53 cancers.

Reactivation of the p53 Pathway in Tumor
Suppression
Most malignant tumors that disrupt p53 signaling pathways
remain addicted to p53 mutants. Various strategies have been
successfully developed to reconstitute p53 functions to abrogate tumor progression (1, 3, 6–8). On the basis of the action
sites, these strategies can be divided into 3 groups: (i) replacing wild-type p53 by gene therapy, (ii) augmenting wild-type
p53 by inhibiting MDM2-mediated degradation, and (iii)
reactivating mutant p53 by altering the protein conformation
(Fig. 1A).
It has been shown that restoring p53 function by introducing the wild-type p53 gene alone is sufficient to cause
regression of several different types of tumors in mice (1, 6).
Gene therapy for p53 replacement delivered by adenoviral
vectors to human tumors has shown very promising results
in a number of clinical trials (9, 10). p53 gene therapy
[Gendicine (Shenzhen SiBiono GeneTech) and Advexin
(Introgen)] administered locally has shown at least partial
clinical responses as monotherapy, and it has increased
the effectiveness of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

Expression of the p53 transgene occurs at high levels and is
associated with the activation of other genes in the p53
pathway after treatment (9). Although these studies provide
a proof-of-principle for p53 replacement, it is also noted that
adenoviral p53 gene therapy by intraperitoneal injection
could not significantly improve standard chemotherapy in
ovarian cancers harboring p53 mutants (10). Several factors,
including inefficient systemic delivery, nonspecific immune
responses, and p53 mutants in cancers, may limit the
efficacy and application of p53 gene therapy (refs. 1 and
10; Fig. 1A).
Investigators have applied a group of small molecules to
target the p53-MDM2 protein interaction to enhance wildtype p53 protein (7, 11–13). Wild-type p53 usually presents at a
low level because of its short half-life (15–30 min), which is
maintained primarily by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. As a
crucial negative regulator, MDM2 works together with MDMX

to ubiquitinate p53 for proteasome-mediated degradation.
Nutlin and MI-219, which accumulate wild-type p53 protein
by binding to MDM2 and blocking p53-MDM2 interaction,
have shown activity against human xenografts in preclinical
models (11, 12). RITA (reactivation of p53 and induction of
tumor apoptosis) accumulates wild-type p53 by binding to p53
protein and preventing p53 interaction with MDM2 (7, 13).
Consequently, these compounds induce the expression of p53responsive genes and trigger apoptosis in various tumor cells
expressing wild-type p53 (11–13). However, the dominantnegative effects and gain-of-function of p53 mutants that
present in almost half of all cancer cases may severely
compromise the effectiveness of compounds that target the
p53-MDM2 interaction (refs. 1, 5, and 10; Fig. 1A).

element primarily depends on its protein structure, which is
divided into a b-sandwich scaffold and a DNA-binding surface
that includes a loop-sheet-helix motif and 2 loops (L2 and L3;
ref. 3). Compound PhiLan083 binds with high affinity to a
crevice created by Cys220 of the p53 mutant and stabilizes the
b-sandwich, which serves as a basic scaffold for the DNAbinding surface (7, 8, 14). On the other hand, another compound, P53R3, restores the sequence-specific DNA binding of
both His273 and His175 of mutant p53 in the DNA-binding
surface (15). CP-31398 prevents unfolding of wild-type or
mutant p53 and stabilizes p53 through reduced ubiquitination. In these ways, CP-31398 induces the expression of p53responsive genes, such as p21, but also induces p53-independent cell death (3, 7, 16). Ellipticine enhances the sequencespecific DNA binding and transcriptional activity of mutant
p53 and consequently induces mutant p53-dependent cell
death (1, 3, 7). PRIMA-1 (p53 reactivation and induction of
massive apoptosis) restores the wild-type conformation to
mutant p53 protein by covalently binding to and modifying
the thiol groups of His175 and His273 in the core domain (8).
The PRIMA-1 analog, APR-246, which inhibits human tumor
growth and is able to synergize with chemotherapeutic drugs,
has shown great potential and is currently being tested in a
clinical trial (8, 17). Additionally, synthetic peptides C369-383
and C361-382, corresponding to the C-terminal residues of
p53, can alter p53 protein conformation by an allosteric
mechanism and restore p53 transactivation in cancer cells,
because the C-terminal negative-regulatory domain of p53
locks the unphosphorylated p53 tetramer in an inactive state
(7). The compounds in this category directly target particular
types of p53 mutants and can be developed as specific
therapeutic agents against cancers harboring these mutants.
Because p53 binds to promoters of the responsive genes in
tetramers, the heterotetramer of wild-type with mutants or
homotetramer of mutants may interfere with the effects of
these compounds on p53 transactivation. Whether these
compounds are able to mediate the formation of p53 tetramer
remains to be studied in p53 mutant cells (Fig. 1A).

Resuscitating Wild-Type p53 Expression by
Disrupting Ceramide Glycosylation
The TP53 mutation is usually heterozygous in both germline
and somatic cells (1, 4). This may provide opportunities to
modulate the transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes to restore wild-type p53 expression in mutant p53
cancer cells. Little is known about whether p53 expression
can be restored in p53 mutant tumors (1, 7, 8); however, it was
recently reported that suppression of glucosylceramide
synthase restores wild-type p53 expression and p53-dependent apoptosis in mutant cancer cells (18). This intriguing
finding provides insight into the p53 mutation in transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes, as well as the role of
sphingolipid in regulating expression, and it provides a novel
approach for targeting cancers that harbor p53 mutants.
It has been speculated that p53 mutants can be corrected in
gene expression level as well as posttranslational modification, and the latter has been broadly demonstrated (1, 3, 8).

www.aacrjournals.org

Heterozygous TP53 that is able to express either wild-type or
mutant heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) has been
detected in most (but not all) mutant p53 tumors (1, 4, 5).
More likely, mutant p53 cancer cells generate heterozygous
hnRNA from the transcription using both wild-type and
mutant DNA; however, these cells produce mutant protein
after translation. NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR-8 cancer cells are
mutant p53 cell lines that dominantly express the p53 mutants
with a deletion of 7 and 6 amino acids (encoded by exon 5),
respectively, within the DBD (18, 19). These deleted mutants
lack p53 transactivational activity and render these cells
resistant to apoptosis induced by DNA damage (18, 19).
Analyses of hnRNA and mRNA revealed that both NCI/
ADR-RES and OVCAR-8 cell lines expressed the same p53
hnRNA as in wild-type cells, even though these p53 mutant
cells could not generate wild-type p53 mRNA when they were
exposed to doxorubicin (18). Of interest, wild-type p53 mRNA
and the phosphorylated p53 protein (at Ser15) presented in the
p53 mutant cells after treatment with mixed backbone oligonucleotide against human glucosylceramide synthase (MBOasGCS) and doxorubicin exposure. Consequently, the functional p53 activated the expression of p53-responsive genes
and induced apoptosis in the p53 mutant cells (18). As a proof
of concept, this study indicates that dysfunctional regulation
in transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes is an
important cause of p53 mutants in cancer cells (Fig. 1B). This
finding raises many questions, and further investigations
should determine which types and locations of p53 mutations
result from dysfunctional regulation of the transcriptional/
posttranscriptional processes, as well as the molecular
mechanisms that underlie these processes. On the basis of
these findings, we should be able to develop therapeutic
approaches to correct or resuscitate wild-type p53 expression
in cancers harboring p53 mutants.
Suppression of GCS has resuscitated p53-dependent apoptosis in p53 mutant cells, indicating that active sphingolipids
play a role in turning the expression of mutant to wild-type
p53 (ref. 18; Fig. 1B). MBO-asGCS that silenced GCS expression
significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated p53 (at
Ser15 in DBD) and p53-responsive genes, including p21Waf1/
Cip1
, Bax, and Puma, in a dose-dependent manner in p53
mutant cells (18). Restoration of p53-dependent apoptosis
by MBO-asGCS dramatically sensitized mutant p53 cancer
to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in cell and animal studies
(18). Resuscitation of p53 expression with GCS suppression
was confirmed in NCI/ADR-RES cells treated with d-threo-1phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, a GCS
inhibitor. Cellular immunofluorescent staining revealed that
MBO-asGCS treatment dramatically decreased GCS protein in
the Golgi apparatus, where ceramide glycosylation occurred,
and consequently increased nuclear phosphorylated p53 in
NCI/ADR-RES cells exposed to doxorubicin (ref. 18; Fig. 1B).
Because GCS catalyzes ceramide glycosylation, converting
ceramide to glucosylceramide, disrupting ceramide glycosylation by silencing of GCS can increase ceramide and decrease
glucosylceramide and other glycosphingolipids (20), as shown
in Fig. 1B. Ceramide is an active sphingolipid that plays critical
roles in processing of apoptosis and other cellular functions

(21–24). It was found that in NCI/ADR-RES cells, MBO-asGCS
treatments significantly increased endogenous ceramide in a
dose-dependent fashion and were directly associated with p53
resuscitation. Phosphorylated wild-type p53 accumulated in
the nucleus, and endogenous ceramide appeared in the cytoplasm of NCI/ADR-RES cells after disruption of ceramide
glycosylation. Fumonisin B1 treatments that inhibited ceramide synthase in the de novo pathway eliminated the effects of
MBO-asGCS on restoration of p53, and exogenous C6-ceramide (but not C6-dihydroceramide) presented the resuscitation of p53 pathways as MBO-asGCS in p53 mutant cells (18).
It is not clear how ceramide modulates p53 resuscitation, but
several studies have suggested that ceramide plays a role in
mediating posttranscriptional processing because it alters
the isoform expression of caspase-9 and bcl-x in cancer cells
(25, 26).
Targeting ceramide glycosylation is an alternative approach
to restore p53 function and improve cancer treatment. Overexpression of GCS, which confers cell resistance to apoptosis,
is a potential marker for predicting tumor response to chemotherapy and clinical progression (27–29). Inhibition of GCS
by gene silencing or tamoxifen leads p53 mutant cancer cells
to apoptosis (20, 28, 30). It has been reported that p53 mutants
upregulate the expression of MDR1, hERT, bFGF, bcl-xl, HSP70,
and other genes, and downregulate the expression of FAS,
PTEN, and others, gaining the oncogenic functions to promote
tumor progression (1, 3, 7). Coincidently, glycosphingolipids
(globo- and ganglio-series) produced after ceramide glycosylation upregulate the expression of MDR1, hERT, bFGF, and
HSP70 in cancer cells, enhancing cell growth and resistance to
therapies (21, 27). On the other hand, inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis or increased endogenous ceramide
represses the expression of MDR1, hERT, bFGF, and HSP70,
and increases the expression of FAS, PTEN, p21, Bax, and
Puma, thus promoting cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and sensitization to cancer therapies (18, 21, 27). Although it is unclear
how frequently GCS is overexpressed with the p53 mutation in
cancers, disrupting ceramide glycosylation resuscitates p53
expression, which directly enhances p53-responsive genes and

simultaneously inhibits p53-repressive genes. Therefore, this
may be a very effective therapeutic approach for cancer
patients (Fig. 1B).

Future Directions
The TP53 mutation presents in loss of heterozygosity, and
90% of p53 mutants in tumors occur within DBD encoded
from exons 4 to 8. Suppression of GCS can restore p53
expression in cells with a deleted mutation of exon 5 (18),
and this approach may be able to resuscitate p53 in cells with a
point mutant (e.g., R172H exon 5; K. Bhinge and Y. Liu,
unpublished data). It has been shown that transcriptional
and posttranscriptional processes are crucial for p53 mutation, although little is known about the regulation mechanisms by which cells specifically express genes like p53 using
an identical allele and which particular posttranscriptional
process is used to determine a wild-type protein or a mutant
one in tumors. Further studies should seek to characterize
therapeutic targets that can restore the p53 signal pathway
to mutant p53-addicted tumors. High levels of GCS and
mutant p53 are coincidently detected in several drug-resistant
ovarian cancer cells lines (18). Investigating the association of
GCS and mutant p53 in drug resistance and the molecular
mechanism by which ceramide mediates p53 restoration in
mutant p53-barrier cancers may lead to the development of
effective approaches to improve cancer treatment.
