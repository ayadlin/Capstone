ABSTRACT
Tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) are believed to drive cancer initiation,
progression and recurrence. These cells are characterized by enhanced tumorigenicity
and self-renewal. The ability to identify such cells in primary human sarcomas relies
on the dye exclusion ability of tumor side population (SP) cells. Here, we performed
a high-throughput cell surface antigen screen and found that CD146 is enriched in
the SP population. In vivo serial transplantation assays showed that CD146+ cells are
highly tumorigenic, capable of self-renewal and thus enriches for the TPC population.
In addition, depletion of SP cells from the CD146+ population show that CD146+
cells and SP cells are a distinct and overlapping TPC populations. Gene expression
profiling of CD146+ and SP cells revealed multiple pathways commonly upregulated
in both of these populations. Inhibition of one of these upregulated pathways, Notch
signaling, significantly reduced tumor growth and self-renewal. Our data demonstrate
that CD146 is an effective cell surface marker for enriching TPCs in primary human
sarcomas. Targeting differentially activated pathways in TPCs may provide new
therapeutic strategies for treating sarcoma.

adult soft tissue sarcoma. Similar to many human
cancers, osteosarcoma and UPS both display substantial
intratumoral heterogeneity. Previous studies found that
sarcomas contain a small subpopulation of cells known
as tumor-propagating cells (TPCs), characterized by
enhanced tumorigenicity and self-renewal capacity [1–3].
TPCs have been hypothesized to drive tumor initiation and

INTRODUCTION
Sarcomas are a diverse group of tumors that arise
in the mesenchymal tissues. Osteosarcoma is the most
common primary bone sarcoma and undifferentiated
pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), previously known as
malignant fibrous histocytoma, is the most common

progression [4, 5]. Therefore, selective targeting of these
cells may be an effective treatment strategy.
The identification of TPCs in many tumor
types relies on flow cytometry analysis of specific
stem cell markers. For sarcomas, the lack of clearly
defined mesenchymal stem cell markers has limited the
identification of TPCs. Previous studies used markers
that were known to enrich for TPCs in other cancers,
such as CD133 and ALDH [6, 7]. However, these studies
were performed using cell lines, and did not consistently
demonstrate robust in vivo serial transplantation capacity
[3, 7, 8]. Another approach is to use functional properties
to enrich for sarcoma TPCs, such as the side population
(SP) assay [2, 9]. This assay is based on the ability of
stem-like and progenitor cells to efflux Hoechst dye. Cells
that can exclude the dye from their nucleus are termed
SP cells, and have been shown to have both increased
tumorigenicity and self-renewal ability compared to selfrenewal ability compared to non-side population (NSP)
cells that make up the bulk of the tumor. However, dye
efflux is a dynamic process, and the lack of specific
criteria and guidelines for delineating the SP fraction can
lead to large variability between studies [10]. As such,
a cell surface marker would be of important utility for
sarcoma TPC research.
Self-renewal is a defining characteristic of TPCs and
is associated with tumor recurrence [4, 11]. Expressions
of genes that regulate self-renewal of normal stem cells
are significant predictors of disease relapse [12–14].
Currently, the clinical outcome of patients with recurrent
or metastatic sarcoma remains poor [15]. The inhibition of
self-renewal in sarcoma TPCs may offer valuable targets
of therapy.
Here, we used a flow cytometry screen to identify
cell surface markers enriched on SP cells compared
to bulk tumor cells. We found CD146 (also known as
MCAM or MUC18), can reliability enrich for TPCs in
osteosarcoma and UPS. Importantly, we showed that
CD146+ and SP cells are independently tumorigenic and
represent overlapping and distinct populations of sarcoma
TPCs. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed that Notch
signaling is activated in both of these two TPC populations
in osteosarcoma. Treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor
significantly reduced the tumor growth and self-renewal
capacity of human osteosarcoma in vivo.

primary bone sarcoma were obtained from patient biopsy
and processed into single cell suspensions. The cells were
stained with Hoechst33342 dye to sort for the SP cells.
We screened 235 cell surface antibodies, and found five
markers that were enriched by greater than 4-fold in the
SP population compared to the NSP cells. Specifically,
25.13% (±13.64%SEM) of the SP population expressed
CD31, 29.51% (±15.01% SEM) expressed CD66, 11.02%
(±3.46% SEM) expressed CD104, 36.34% (±24.27%
SEM) expressed CD144 and 16.60% expressed CD146
(±8.10% SEM). In the NSP population, 1.37% (±0.52
SEM) expressed CD31, 0.75% (±0.24% SEM) expressed
CD66, 2.47% (± 1.63% SEM) expressed CD104, 0.95%
(±0.62%) expressed CD144, and 4.62% (±1.47%)
expressed CD146.

An antibody to CD146 identified a population of
sarcoma cells enriched in SP cells
We tested the ability of each of the 5 markers to
enrich for tumorigenic sarcoma cells by transplanting
the cells in vivo. The marker-positive cells were FACS
sorted from a UPS and an osteosarcoma sample, and
subcutaneously injected at dilutions ranging from
100 to 10,000 cells into NOD-scid IL2rγnull (NSG) mice.
After 20 weeks, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors
that formed were weighed and examined by histologic
examination. CD31+, CD66+, CD104+ and CD144+ cells
did not show higher tumor initiating ability compared to
their respective marker negative populations or bulk tumor
cells (data not show). In contrast, CD146+ cells enriched
for TPCs close to 50-folds higher than CD146− cells.
We then analyzed the expression of CD146 using
flow cytometry in an independent cohort of 10 human
UPS samples and 5 human osteosarcoma samples. The
mean percentage of SP and CD146 cells in UPS is 0.70%
(±0.16%SEM) and 3.63%(±0.95%SEM) respectively, per
tumor. The expression of CD146 was significantly enriched
in the SP population compared to the NSP cells (P < 0.001),
with 53.2% (±9.51% SEM) of SP cells expressing CD146,
and 2.98% (±0.90% SEM) of NSP cells expressing
CD146 (Figure 1A, 1B). We observed 1 UPS sample
(UPS106) with higher percentage of CD146+ cells in the
NSP populations than the SP population (Supplementary
Table S1). This was likely due to the heterogeneity among
different patient tumor biopsies. In osteosarcoma, the
mean percentage SP and CD146+ cells is 0.68% (± 0.28
SEM) and 4.92% (±0.90 SEM) respectively. Similar
to UPS, 49.37% (±15.48% SEM) of SP cells express
CD146, as compared to 4.73% (±0.87% SEM) of NSP
(P < 0.05, Figure 1B, Supplementary Table S2). Overall,
the enrichment of CD146+ cells in SP suggests that there
is an overlapping population of CD146+ cells and SP cells.
The location of CD146+ cells in UPS and
osteosarcoma was visualized using immunofluorescence.
Since CD146 is also a marker of pericytes [18], we stained

characteristics of the parent tumor [19]. As such, we serially
injected CD146+ and CD146− cells from primary xenografts
into fresh NSG mice. In secondary and tertiary transplants,
CD146+ cells continued to exhibit enriched tumor-forming
ability compared to CD146− cells (Tables 1 and 2).
Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin staining of tumors
xenograft derived from CD146+ cells resembled the
patient tumor in both UPS and osteosarcoma (Figure 2A).
To determine the frequency of TPC enrichment in
CD146+ fraction, we used the Extreme Limiting Dilution
Analysis (ELDA) algorithm on data from the secondary
transplants [20]. For UPS, the frequency of TPCs in the
CD146+ fraction is 1/555 cells, compared to 1/17002 cells
in CD146− fraction, indicating a 30.6-fold enrichment
(P = 3.60e-36, Figure 2B). For osteosarcoma, the TPC
frequency is 1/2830 cells and 1/68375 cells in CD146−
fraction, indicating a 24.2-fold enrichment (P = 5.13e-29,
Figure 2B).
Taken together, these data show that CD146
reliably identifies a population of cells in sarcoma that are
enriched for TPCs, which are characterized by enhanced
tumorigenicity, the ability to self-renewal, and the ability
to initiate tumors that resembles the parent tumor.

CD146+ cells show increased tumorigenicity
The ability of CD146+ cells to initiate tumors was
tested in 5 additional primary human UPS and 5 primary
osteosarcoma samples using limiting dilution xenograft
assay. As few as 10 CD146+ cells in UPS formed tumors
at high frequency. In contrast, only a few mice developed
tumors when injected with 1, 000 UPS cells from the
CD146− fraction (Table 1). Similarly, the CD146+ cells in
osteosarcoma exhibited substantially higher tumor-forming
capacity compared to the CD146− cells (Table 2).

CD146+ cells are capable of self-renewal and
generate tumors that recapitulate parent tumor

CD146+ enriches for a distinct TPC population
from SP cells

Common signaling pathways are upregulated in
CD146+ and SP populations

Since CD146 was identified based on its enrichment
in the SP population, we examined whether if the
tumorigenic and self-renewal capacity of CD146+ cells
are dependent on the SP population. We isolated the NSP
population following Hoechst dye staining, and sorted
for CD146+ and CD146- fractions. The sorted cells were
injected into NSG mice at different dilutions. We found
that the NSP CD146+ population was significantly more
tumorigenic than the NSP CD146− population over
serial transplants (Table 3, P = 9.58e-13). Therefore,
despite the overlap between SP and CD146+ population,
CD146+ cells depleted of SP remain enriched for tumor
propagating capacity, suggesting that CD146 enrich for a
subpopulation of TPCs in sarcoma that both overlap with,
but also distinct from SP cells.

To further examine similarities and differences
between the cell populations, gene expression profiling
was undertaken to compare the various cell fractions. This
data was used to identify cell-signaling pathways that are
differentially regulated in the same manner in both CD146+
and SP cells. Four separate populations of CD146+,
CD146−, SP and NSP were sorted from 3 osteosarcoma
samples, and their expression profiles were analyzed.
Using a 1.5 fold change and a P < 0.05 as thresholds, we
identified 3763 differentially expressed  genes between
CD146+ versus CD146− cells and 757 differentially
expressed genes between SP versus NSP cell. Using
Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA), we performed
pathways analysis for CD146+ versus CD146− cells and
SP versus NSP cells. This analysis identified multiple

targetable pathways that were similarly affected in the SP
and CD146+ populations (Figure S2]. In particular, TGFβ and Notch signaling pathways, both known to regulate
stem cell properties and contribute to tumorigenesis [1,
21, 22] were significantly enriched in upregulated genes
(Figure 3A and 3B). To validate this, the expression of
known TGF-β and Notch signaling target genes were
measured by qPCR in SP and CD146+ fractions relative
to their negative counterparts (Figure 3C). Comparison

between CD146+ and CD146− cells showed significant
upregulation of CTGF, c-JUN, PAI-1, HEY1, and HEY2.
With the exception of CTGF, these target genes were also
significantly upregulated in the SP population [19, 23].
This analysis also identified pathways with different
enrichment results between SP and CD146+ cells.
Specifically, FGFR, camodulin, CREB and phospholipase
C associated signaling were enriched in SP cells but
not CD146+ cells (Figure S2A). On the other hand,

treated cells in fresh NSG mice. DAPT treated cells
showed significantly reduced ability to initiate tumors
(Figure 4C). Thus, Notch signaling drives self-renewal
in osteosarcoma, and its inhibition, using agents such as
DAPT may serve as a potential therapy against sarcoma
self-renewal.

Inhibition of Notch signaling reduces tumor
growth and self-renewal

DISCUSSION

The self-renewal capacity of TPCs has been
hypothesized to contribute to tumor recurrence [4]. To
determine if pathways enriched in both SP and CD146
positive cells would drive self-renewal, we examined one
such pathway, Notch signaling using a pharmacological
inhibitor. This signaling pathway is known to regulate
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) differentiation [1,
24, 25]. NSG mice bearing primary human osteosarcoma
cells were treated with DAPT, a γ-secretase inhibitor
that targets Notch signaling. After 3 weeks of treatment,
mice that received DAPT showed significantly smaller
tumor sizes compared to the vehicle treated mice, and
the expression of Notch target genes were reduced in
the treated tumors (Figure 4A, 4B). Next, we compared
the self-renewal potential of these cells by examining
the tumor-initiating potential of DAPT and vehicle

In this study, flow cytometry screen of cell surface
markers on sarcoma SP cells and functional validation
by serial transplantations identified CD146 as a marker
enriching for tumor propagating capacity in UPS and
osteosarcoma. This is the first cell surface marker
identified in primary sarcoma samples. Previously
identified cell markers in sarcomas have not been tested
in human patient samples using the gold standard in vivo
serial transplantation assay for evaluating self-renewal.
Since CD146 can be readily detected with various
approaches using antibodies, it has significant advantages
compared to the SP analysis, which is a technically
challenging method that often produces inconsistent
results from the same sample.
CD146 is a cell-adhesion molecule that belongs
to the immunoglobulin superfamily [26]. It was first

identified as a specific antigen for human malignant
melanoma,  and its expression was subsequently shown
to associate with poor survival, tumor progression,
and metastasis in other cancers [27–29]. Certain MSC
populations, such as pericytes, also express CD146 [18].
We identified CD146 based on its expression in the SP
cells, a population that has been previously shown by
multiple studies to be highly enriched for TPCs [1, 2,
16, 17, 30]. CD146+ cells in sarcomas are relatively
more abundant representing 3.61% of UPS and 4.91% of
osteosarcoma. The ability of CD146+ to initiate tumors
over multiple transplantations suggests it indeed enriches
for TPCs with self-renewal ability. However, in many
human cancers where TPCs has been identified, the
percentage of these cells is generally less than 0.04% [31].
In theory, a single TPC is sufficient to generate tumors.
The reduced ability of CD146+ cells to form tumors at
the 10 cell dose suggest that even though this population
is enriched for TPCs, it may contain other cells such as
transit amplifying cells.
Our serial transplantation data showed that
CD146+ cells possess TPC properties in the absent of
SP cells. This indicates that the TPC population in UPS
and osteosarcoma may be heterogeneous, and the NSP
CD146+ cells are a distinct TPC population with some
overlap in the SP population. The heterogeneity of
TPCs also suggests that these populations may respond
differently to targeted therapy. Indeed, Kreso et al found
that different clonal populations with TPC properties in
colorectal cancer vary in their proliferative potential, selfrenewal ability and response to therapy [32]. As such,
identification of common pathways in the heterogeneous
TPC populations may offer one approach to identify
effective targets of therapy.
Using gene expression profiling and pathway
analysis, we showed that Notch signaling is activated in
both SP and CD146+ cells. Treatment of patient derived
xenograft in mice with DAPT, a known inhibitor of
Notch signaling, significantly reduced primary tumor
growth. More importantly, DAPT inhibited the tumors
from growing back in secondary transplants, even with
treatment withdrawal, demonstrating that this treatment
targets self-renewal. The importance of Notch signaling
in osteosarcoma initiation is further substantiated by
recent work from Tao et al, which showed that overexpression of Notch-1 Intracellular Domain in MSCs and
osteoblast progenitor cells drives osteosarcoma formation
in mice [21]. In addition, we found other self-renewal
pathways activated in SP and CD146+ cells. Hedgehog
and YAP signaling pathways may be activated in CD146+
cells. TGF-β signaling, which participates in stem-cell
maintenance is upregulated in both SP and CD146+ cells
[22]. Wnt activation is observed in SP cells, but was not
statistically significant in our data. This suggests that
self-renewal pathways may be heterogeneous in different
tumor samples. Furthermore, our pathway analysis showed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that metabolic pathways, especially, glucose metabolism
are upregulated in the SP and CD146+ cells. The increased
glucose uptake of TPCs compared to bulk tumor cells may
contribute to their survival advantage [33–35]. Future
investigations to target signaling pathways differentially
regulated in TPCs may have therapeutic value.
The tumor microenviroment plays important roles
in regulating the properties of TPCs [36]. Emerging
evidence suggest that stromal cells, non-TPC tumor cells,
and the extracellular matrix provide important signaling
molecules that supports TPCs growth, self-renewal,
and protects TPCs from immunosurveillance [5, 37].
A potential limitation of the xenograft model is that certain
aspects of the tumor microenvironment may not be fully
recapitulated in the recipient animal. This may select
for certain cells that are more suited for the transplant
environment, affecting the accurate estimation of cells
with tumor propagating capacity [38]. Developments
of more immunodeficient mice, and humanized mice
that expresses signaling molecules found in the tumor
microenvironment may allow more accurate assessment of
TPCs. Alternatively, lineage tracing of TPCs in transgenic
mouse models of sarcomas may allow us to further
characterize the role of TPCs in their native environment.
Our study identified CD146 as a cell surface marker
for cells enriched in TPC properties in primary human
sarcomas. Using in vivo model, we demonstrated that
CD146+ tumor cells show increased tumorigenicity, selfrenewal ability, and can initiate tumors that resemble
the primary patient tumor. Furthermore, the tumorigenic
potential of CD146+ cells is also independent of the SP
fraction, a known TPC enriched population, suggesting
that the sarcoma TPC population may be heterogeneous.
Our gene expression profiling and pathway analysis
of CD146+ and SP cells identified Notch signaling is a
potential target for inhibiting osteosarcoma self-renewal.
Given the potential heterogeneity of TPCs, in addition to
CD146, other novel markers of TPCs may exist. Future
identification and characterization of sarcoma TPCs may
reveal new targets of therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

at the time of initial biopsy, prior to any therapy.
A  musculoskeletal pathologist verified the diagnosis
of the tumors. To generate single-cell suspensions, the
samples were mechanically dissociated into small pieces,
and enzymatically digested with a mixture of 10mg/mL of
collagenase IV (Worthington), 2.4U/ml of Dispase (Becton
Dickinson), and 0.05% trypsin (Wisent) for 45–60minutes

flow cytometry activated cell sorting (FACS).

to FlowJo version 9.3 for analysis. Dead cells, debris,
cell doublets and CD45+ immune cells were excluded
from the analysis, after which side-population and bulk
tumor cells were analyzed for expression of each of
the 235 markers. Enrichment of a cell surface marker
was determined by comparing the percent of markerpositive cells in the SP population to the percent of
marker-positive cells in bulk tumor cells. Markers with
an enrichment of ≥ 4-fold in two of the three samples
analyzed were selected for testing in vivo.

Flow cytometry
Side population (SP) cells were collected as
previously described [2]. Briefly, single-cell suspensions
were treated with 2.5 mg/mL of Hoechst 33342 dye
(Sigma) alone, or in combination with 50 mmol/L of
verapamil (Sigma) as a negative control, for 90 minutes
at 37°C. SP, cells were identified using dual wavelength
analysis (blue, 424–444 nm; red, 675 nm) after excitation
with 350 nm UV light (MoFlowXDP). Staining with
CD45 antibody (BD Pharmingen) was used to eliminate
hematopoetic cells. To sort for CD146+ cells, processed
tumor cells were stained with anti human CD146-PE
conjugated antibody at 1:100 dilution for 30 minutes at
4°C (BD Pharmingen). Murine cells, which makes up
the tumor stroma in the xenografts were excluded from
staining with a biotin conjugated anti-mouse H-2kd
antibody (BD Pharmingen) streptavidin PE-Cy7 conjugate
(Invitrogen) at 1:1,000 for 30 minutes at 4°C. H-2kd+ cells
were removed from analysis during FACS. Since the
stromal cells are likely derived from the mouse, removing
the H-2k+ cells allow us to deplete the stromal cells from
the tumor [1, 2]. In all flow cytometry experiments, cells
were counterstained with 1 mg/mL of propidium iodide
(PI; Molecular Probes) and the dead cells were removed
from the analysis.

Limiting dilution assay
Individual cells sorted from flow cytometry
according to various markers including CD146 were
suspended in PBS. Murine cells from xenografts were
excluded during FACS by staining with a biotinconjugated anti-mouse H-2k antibody (BD Pharmingen).
The sorted cell counts from flow cytometry were manually
confirmed with a hemocytometer and then serially diluted
in PBS to achieve cell range between 10–105 cells/100 μl.
For each injection, the cells were mixed with an equal
volume of ice-cold Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) and
subcutaneously injected into 6- to 8- week-old NOD-scid
IL2rγnull (NSG) mice. After injection, the mice were
observed for 24 weeks and the tumors were dissected.
The tumors were weighed using an analytical balance
and were examined histologically. Tumor-propagating
cell frequency was calculated based on extreme limiting
dilution data from the secondary tumor transplantations
as described in [20]. The model follows standard general
linearized models to compare the frequency of TPCs
in one or more populations, and allows for one-sided
confidence intervals if 0% or 100% positive responses are
observed [20, 39]. The model can be accessed online at
http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/ from Walter and
Eliza-Hall Institute [20].

Flow-cytometry cell surface antigen screen
The SP and NSP suspensions were incubated
on ice in flow cytometry buffer (FC buffer: Hanks
balanced salt solution with 1% BSA, 2 mM EDTA). The
cells were aliquoted into round-bottom 96-well plates
containing 235 fluorochrome-conjugated cell-surface
targeted antibodies (i.e. each of 235 wells contained a
different antibody, Supplementary Table S3). Antibodies
were labeled with PE, FITC or APC. Wells containing
buffer only were included as negative controls. Cells
were suspended at a concentration to achieve a minimum
cell number of 50,000 cells per well in a final volume
of 200 ul per well. The final antibody dilution was 1:50
for all antibodies. Once cells were added to the wells,
plates were incubated on ice in the dark for 20 minutes.
Plates were centrifuged to pellet cells, buffer aspirated,
and pellets were washed twice with 200 ul of FC
buffer. Finally, pellets were suspended in 100 ul of FC
buffer containing 1 ug/ml of propidium iodide to allow
exclusion of dead cells. Cells were then analyzed on a
BD LSRII equipped with a high throughput sampler.
A minimum of 10,000 events per well were collected on
FACSDiva software, and resulting FCS 3.0 files exported

Histology and immunofloresence
Tumor biopsies from patients and mice xenografts
were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Tumor
sections were cut at 8 μm and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin following standard procedure and observed in
a blinded manner. At least 5 sections from each tumor
sample were analyzed. For immunofloresence, fresh
tumors biopsies from patients were embedded in Tissue
Tek O.C.T compound (Fisher Scientific) and snap frozen
in dry ice. Sections of 8 μm were cut and blocked with
10% donkey serum, 2%BSA, in 1X PBST for 1 hour
at room temperature. Tissue slides were incubated with
CD31 antibody (Abcam) at 1:50 dilution for 1 hour.
This was followed by secondary antibody labeling with
Alexa488 goat anti-rabbit (Life Technologies) at 1:1000
dilutions for 30 minutes. CD146 (BD Pharmagen) were
diluted at 1: 5000 and incubated on the tissue slides for
30 minutes, followed by Alexa594 donkey anti-mouse
40291

antibody at 1:1000 dilutions for 30 minutes. The slides
were mounted with mounting media containing DAPI
(Vectashield, Vector Laboratories Inc) and imaged.

Eight to 10 weeks old NSG mice were
subcutaneously injected on the left flank at 200,000 cells
dissolved in Matrigel. After 6 weeks the animals were
treated with N-[(3,5-Difluorophenyl)acetyl]-L-alanyl2-phenyl]glycine-1,1-dimethylethyl
ester
(DAPT)
dissolved in corn oil with 5% DMSO 100 mg/kg/day
(Selleck Chemicals, Texas) or vehicle via intraperitoneal
injection for 22 days. The mice were euthanized and
tumors were harvested. Each tumor was dissected free
from surrounding tissues and weighed. The tumors were
then digested into single cell suspension, and injected into
fresh NSG mice at limiting dilutions, as described above.
Secondary transplants were observed for up to 16 weeks.

Gene expression profiling analyses
Three independent human osteosarcoma xenografts
were sorted for SP, NSP, CD146+ and CD146- fractions.
The stromal cells were removed by staining with antimouse H-2k antibody (BD Pharmingen). RNA samples
were extracted and converted to cDNA using Ovation
RNA Amplification System V2 (Nugen) following
manufacture’s protocol. The cDNA was analyzed using
Illumina HT-12 v4 platform following standard protocol.
Results were analyzed using R (version 3.2.0] with the
LIMMA (linear models for microarray data) package
[40, 41]. We examined the raw data with a Normexp
by Control (neqc) algorithm pre-processing strategy
described by Shi et al using R [42]. This approach
includes background correction, quantile normalization
and log2 transformation to the raw data [42, 43].
Differentially expressed genes were identified using
LIMMA as described in [44]. Differentially expressed
genes were by fitting a linear model for each gene in
the data, and then an empirical Bayes (EB) method is
used to moderate the standard errors for each gene
expression. Genes with a fold-change > 1.5 and P < 0.05
were considered significant. The microarray data was
submitted to the NCBI GEO database with the identifier
GSE63390.

Statistical analyses
Statically analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism v6. All results are representative of at least n = 3.
The data were shown as mean ± standard error of mean
(SEM), unless otherwise stated, and was calculated
using Prism. Statistical significance was calculated using
two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test. A P value < 0.05 is
considered significant.
