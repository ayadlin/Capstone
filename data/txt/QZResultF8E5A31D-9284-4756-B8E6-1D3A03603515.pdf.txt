ABSTRACT
CD81 is a cell surface protein which belongs to the tetraspanin family. While in
multiple myeloma its expression on plasma cells is associated with worse prognosis,
this has not yet been explored in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We measured
membrane expression of CD81 on AML cells at diagnosis, evaluated its association with
AML characteristics and its influence on patient outcome after intensive chemotherapy
in a cohort of 134 patients. CD81 was detected in 92/134 (69%) patients. Patients
with AML expressing CD81 had elevated leukocyte count (P=0.02) and were more
likely classified as intermediate or adverse-risk by cytogenetics (P<0.001). CD81
expression had a negative impact on survival (event-free survival, overall survival and
relapse-free survival) in univariate (P<0.001) and in multivariate analyses (P=0.003,
0.002 and <0.001, respectively). CD81 has a negative impact on OS in patients with
NPM1 mutation (P=0.01) and in patients ELN-favorable (P=0.002). In conclusion, this
cell surface marker may be a new prognostic marker for diagnostic risk classification
and a potential therapeutic target for drug development in AML.

several stages of carcinogenesis as well as in metastasis
and angiogenesis [6]. Interestingly, Vences-Catalàn
and colleagues have demonstrated a dominant role of
CD81 affecting metastasis and immunomodulation
in cancer [7]. Targeting of CD81 may decrease fusion
of metastatic colon carcinoma cells and may improve
sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents [8]. Specifically,
CD81 may be important in hematopoiesis as it allows
hematopoietic stem cells to re-enter to quiescence [9].
In hematologic malignancies, CD81 has mostly been
studied in multiple myeloma where its expression on
plasma cells is associated with worse progression free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [10]. Yet, the
prognostic value of CD81 has not been addressed in
myeloid malignancies, such as AML.

INTRODUCTION
CD81 antigen belongs to the tetraspanin family
(33 members in mammals), which are cell surface
transmembrane proteins. This antigen was originally
discovered as a target of an antiproliferative antibody
and subsequently named TAPA-1 [1]. It associates
with other proteins in dynamic membrane entities
called tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) and
partners may vary according to cell type (e.g., CD19
in B cells) [2]. Various cellular functions are linked
to CD81 (i.e., BCR signaling in B cells [3], B-T cell
interaction [4] and cell entry receptor function for
different infectious diseases [5]). Furthermore, recent
studies showed that tetraspanins are implicated at

AML is a leading cause of leukemia-related
mortality, characterized by maturation arrest and
subsequent accumulation of blast cells at various stages
of incomplete differentiation, and by reduced production
of healthy hematopoietic elements [11]. Importantly, AML
is a heterogeneous disease at both the phenotypic and
molecular level with a variety of distinct genetic alterations
giving rise to the disease. Currently, the combination of
three days of daunorubicin and seven days of cytarabine
is still accepted as the cornerstone of induction treatment
allowing complete remission in younger patients in 7080% of the cases [12]. Nevertheless, relapse still occurs
in approximately half of the patients diagnosed with AML
and the 5-year overall survival rate is only about 40% [11].
Over the past few years, identification of new
prognostic remains important; especially those potentially
refining therapeutic options. The development of prognostic
markers is particularly important in AML with normal
cytogenetics (CN AML) and currently, three molecular
markers (NPM1- and CEBPA mutations and FLT3 internal
tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)) are used in clinical practice
[13]. Prognostic value of CD81 expression in multiple
myeloma and its use as a marker in minimal residual disease
(MRD) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are well
established [14]. In this study, we analyzed the association of
CD81 with other biological factors and its effects on patient
outcomes in AML.

range=21 to 42%; n=11; Figure 1A). In contrast,
expression of CD81 on AML blasts is more heterogeneous
(mean=range=0.1 to 100%, n=134) and significantly
higher (47%; P<0.001; Figure 1B). Interestingly, we
observed two types of AML firstly, 43% of AML with
high CD81 expression (more than 50% of blasts, Figure
2A) and secondly, 31% of AML had no CD81 expression
commonly defined as less than 20% of blasts [15]
(Figure 2B). While all physiologic myeloblasts showed
intermediate CD81 expression, only 25% of AML were
found in that range (Figure 2C).

Association of CD81 with prognostic factors in
AML
A total of 134 patients were included in our study
with ages ranging from 18 to 78 years. We compared
patient characteristics between AML blasts positive vs.
negative for CD81 expression (Table 1). Expression of
CD81 was found in the majority of AML (92 of 134,
69%), but no CD81 expression was associated with
favorable characteristics (i.e., younger age, lower WBC
and favorable cytogenetics). In contrast, positive CD81
expression was associated with FAB types M1 and M5
and unfavorable cytogenetics (Table 1). No difference
was found for sex, hemoglobin level, platelet count,
FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutational status. CD81 positive
AML tended to include more AML with FLT3-ITD
mutation (P=0.06). AML patients with CD81 positive
blast cells were of higher age, had higher white blood
cell counts (WBC) at diagnosis (P=0.02) and were more
likely to have AML with intermediate or adverse-risk
cytogenetics (P<0.001).

distribution with a mean of 47%. Thus, we determined
three groups of patients based upon CD81 expression
on blast cells: CD81- (<20%, n=42), CD81+ (20 to 50%,
n=34) and CD81++ (>50%, n=59). A worse survival was
associated with a higher expression of CD81 considering
OS, EFS and RFS (P<0.001) compared to those CD81-low
(Figure 3).
Interestingly, among the NPM1 mutated patients,

DISCUSSION
AML is a heterogeneous disease and prognostic
factors have become increasingly important in order
to propose appropriate therapy. Currently, cytogenetic
analysis is most important for AML risk classification
[11] and, according to standard recommendations
three risk groups are defined: favorable, intermediate

and adverse [16]. In CN AML, prognostic tools are
particularly relevant and subgroups have been defined,
based on the mutational status of genes such as FLT3ITD, NPM1, and CEBPA [17]. Nevertheless, new
prognostic factors are needed to better discriminate

patients with AML. In this study, we evaluated the
prognostic impact of CD81 expression in a cohort of
134 adult patients treated with intensive chemotherapy
for AML. We found expression of CD81 in 69% of
all AML cases and with a higher frequency in AML

with FLT3-ITD mutation (P=0.06). Expression of
CD81 was associated with a worse clinical outcome
as it negatively affected survival (EFS, OS and RFS)
in univariate and multivariate analyses. Furthermore,
this negative impact is even stronger with high CD81
expressing blast cells.

In multiple myeloma, detection of CD81 positive
plasma cells was an independent negative prognostic
factor for PFS and OS [10]. This study by Paiva et al
investigated CD81 expression by MFC in 230 patients
with plasma cell myeloma (PCM) and found a positive
expression in 45% of the patients. The adverse impact of

CD81 was then validated in an additional 325 transplantcandidate PCM patients. Moreover, dim or negative CD81
expression was only observed in abnormal plasma cells
[18]. In another study, circulating plasma cells showed
significant down-regulation of integrins and activating
molecules including CD81; this finding suggests a
potential role in plasma cell homing for CD81 [10].
AML with more than 20% of CD81 positive blast
cells showed a significant adverse prognosis for EFS,
OS and RFS. In our study, these patients were older, had
higher white blood count and showed an association with
intermediate and adverse-risk cytogenetics compared
to patients with less than 20% CD81 blasts. In ELNfavorable group, a percentage of CD81 over 20% had a
significant negative impact on OS (P=0.002): this data is
particularly interesting as it allows discriminating patients
in this low-risk group. Further studies are needed to
determine whether this subgroup of patients with AML
will benefit from dose-intensified chemotherapy.
CD81 definitely exerts a negative impact on
survival outcome in AML patients. Nevertheless, the
mechanisms by which CD81 induces poor prognosis in
AML are yet unknown. However, as we did not find any
difference between patients with CD81+ vs. CD81- AML
in achieving complete remission (CR) after remission
induction therapy, the mechanism may be less likely to be
chemotherapy resistance induced by CD81 expression on
leukemic blasts. Though, we did note a trend for higher
CD81 expression in AML of patients who did not achieve
CR. Furthermore, larger cohort of patients is necessary
to prove significance of CD81 expression on relapse
within subgroups of AML. Furthermore, patients with
CD81 positive expression presented with higher WBC at
diagnosis, which may be explained by a defect in blast
cell homing. Therefore, the role of CD81 in blast cell
homing needs to be determined in AML, as similar effects
have been described in multiple myeloma [10]. CD81 is
physiologically implicated in the re-entry of hematopoietic
stem cells into the quiescent state in order to control self
renewal after induced proliferation. In leukemic blasts
however, any alteration of this function may influence
tumor dormancy and treatment outcome in patients with
AML with different levels of CD81 expression.
Finally, our study provided the rational for novel
therapeutic approaches targeting CD81 to be considered.
Accordingly, anti-CD81 have demonstrated in vivo
efficacy in HCV [19] and Plasmodium falciparum [20]
infections. Future independent studies are needed to
confirm prognostic impact of CD81 in AML.

study. All patients were treated in the department of
hematology of Lille hospital. Signed informed consent
was obtained from each patient in accordance with the
declaration of Helsinki. Cytogenetic risk was determined
according to standard criteria [21].
Complete remission (CR) criteria were defined
in agreement with the European Leukemia Net
recommendation [13].

Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC)
Diagnostic blast cells were obtained from fresh or
thawed cryopreserved BM aspirates after red blood cell
lysis. Of note, MFC results were not different between
fresh and frozen BM cells done for five patients (data
not shown). Each sample was washed twice with
phosphate buffered saline and stained separately for
30 min at room temperature with two antibody panels.
The first antibody panel contained: anti-CD36-FITC
(clone FA6-152, Iotest, Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea,
CA, USA ), anti-CD81-PE (clone JS24, Beckman
Coulter), anti-CD33-PC5.5 (clone D3HL60.251, Iotest,
Beckman Coulter), anti-CD34-AA700 (clone 581,
Iotest, Beckman Coulter), and anti-CD45-KO (clone
J.33, Iotest, Beckman Coulter).
The second antibody panel included: anti-CD7FITC (clone 8H8.1, Iotest, Beckman Coulter), anti-CD13PE (clone SJ1D1, Iotest, Beckman Coulter), anti-CD19ECD (clone J3-119, Iotest, Beckman Coulter), anti-CD33
PC5.5 (clone D3HL60.251, Iotest, Beckman Coulter),
anti-CD117-APC (clone 104D2D1, Iotest, Beckman
Coulter), anti-CD34-AA700 (clone 581, Iotest, Beckman
Coulter), anti-HLA-DR-PB (clone Immu-357, Iotest,
Beckman Coulter), and anti-CD45-KO (clone J.33, Iotest,
Beckman Coulter). A minimum of 5 x 105 events were
acquired.
Blast cells were gated as CD45dim, SSClow,
CD33+ and lymphocytes (CD45bright, SSClow, CD33−),
monocytes (CD45int/bright, SSCint, CD33bright) and mature
myelomonocytic cells (CD45int, SSChigh, CD33dim/neg) were
excluded.
Isotype control (clone 7T4-IF5, Iotest, Beckman
Coulter) was used to better define the threshold of CD81
positive-stained cells. Results are reported as percent
of positive blast cells. If more than 20% of the blast
population is stained, the AML sample is considered CD81
positive [22].
Measurements were performed on a Navios
flow cytometer and analyzed with Kaluza software
(Beckman-Coulter). The cytometer settings were daily
tested for optical alignment, fluidic stability, optical
detector sensitivity and standardization using adapted
fluorospheres (Flowset targets™ and Flowcheck™,
Beckman-Coulter) [22].

and T cells. Immunol Res. 2014; 58:179-185.

The distribution of quantitative variables was
verified graphically and by a Shapiro-Wilk test and the
comparison between normal and AML BM sample on
CD81 expression was tested using the Student t-test.
Differences between patients with less than 20% of
expression of CD81 and those with more than 20% of
expression of CD81 on baseline quantitative variables
were assessed by Student t- or Mann-Whitney U-test and
qualitative variables were compared using Chi-square or
Fisher Exact test.
Quantitative variables associated with either overall
survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) or relapse-free
survival (RFS) were tested with the Cox model. For
patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation,
survival was censored at the date of transplantation, and
for patients alive, survival was censored at the date of
last known alive. The association between expression of
CD81 and OS, EFS and RFS was adjusted by cytogenetic
risk, age at diagnosis and NPM1+/FLT3-ITD- status.
OS, EFS and RFS were described by the Kaplan Meier
method stratified by expression of CD81 according to
greater than or equal to 20%, commonly defined as the
bottom detection limit [15] and greater than or equal to
50%, defined as CD81 over-expressing AML (i.e., top
quartile).
All statistical tests were two-tailed and the
significance level was set to 0.05. Statistical analysis was
performed with SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).
