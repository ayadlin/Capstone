Abstract
Loss of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) between cancer cells is a common characteristic of
malignant transformation. This communication is mediated by connexin proteins that make up the functional units
of gap junctions. Connexins are highly regulated at the protein level and phosphorylation events play a key role in
their trafficking and degradation. The metastasis suppressor breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1)
upregulates GJIC and decreases phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. On the basis of these observations, we
set out to determine whether there was a link between PI3K and GJIC in tumorigenic and metastatic cell lines.
Treatment of cells with the well-known PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and its structural analogue LY303511, which does
not inhibit PI3K, increased homotypic GJIC; however, we found the effect to be independent of PI3K/AKT inhibition.
We show in multiple cancer cell lines of varying metastatic capability that GJIC can be restored without enforced
expression of a connexin gene. In addition, while levels of connexin 43 remained unchanged, its relocalization from
the cytosol to the plasma membrane was observed. Both LY294002 and LY303511 increased the activity of protein
kinase A (PKA). Moreover, PKA blockade by the small molecule inhibitor H89 decreased the LY294002/LY303511mediated increase in GJIC. Collectively, our findings show a connection between PKA activity and GJIC mediated by
PI3K-independent mechanisms of LY294002 and LY303511. Manipulation of these signaling pathways could prove
useful for antimetastatic therapy. Cancer Res; 70(23); 10002–11. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
The deadliest attribute of cancer cells is their ability to disseminate and colonize other tissues (1). The process of metastasis
involves genetic changes that result in dysregulation of tumor cell
interactions with other tumor cells and the host (2, 3). Breast cancer
metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) blocks the ability of breast (4–7),
melanoma (8), ovarian (9), and non–small cell lung (10) cancer cells
to metastasize but does not block the formation of orthotopic
tumors following injection. BRMS1 is a component of multiple
SIN3:HDAC complexes that alter the expression of numerous genes
and proteins (11–13). Among the first identified phenotypic
changes reported for BRMS1-expressing cells was the restoration
of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC; ref. 14).

GJIC is defined as a process in which small molecules (e.g.,
inositol trisphosphate, ATP, Ca2þ) can be transferred between
adjoining cells through physical interaction of highly regulated
channels located in the plasma membrane. These functional
channels are composed of hexameric structures (connexons)
made up of individual connexin proteins that interact with
numerous other components within the plasma membrane
(15). GJIC is associated with normal cellular homeostasis, but
dysregulation is common in neoplastic progression and even
further loss of communication is often associated with acquisition of a metastatic phenotype (16–19). However, exceptions to
this trend exist, for example, Nicolson et al. showed that cells
transfected with p21ras exhibited higher metastatic potential
but did not always lose GJIC (20). Nevertheless, restoration of
GJIC by expression of connexins in some models decreases
proliferation and inhibits metastasis (21–25). Contradictory
reports show an increase in migratory and metastatic potential
when GJIC is increased [reviewed in (26, 27)], highlighting celland context-specific components of the process.
Because some connexins function in a plasma membrane–
independent manner (28) and because posttranslational modifications and assembly of connexins into connexons can be
regulated by altered signaling pathways (29, 30), we hypothesized that the selective alteration of phosphoinositide levels by
BRMS1 (31) could be, at least partially, involved in the
regulation of GJIC. Specifically, BRMS1 expression results in
a dramatic greater than 95% reduction in PtdIns (4, 5) P2 levels

(31), leading to a decrease in phosphorylation of AKT at
Ser473. Because PtdIns (4, 5) P2 is a major substrate for the
oncogenic phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and is a major
component of lipid rafts in which connexons form (32, 33), we
tested whether inhibition of PI3K by the commonly used PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 would itself mimic BRMS1 in BRMS1 null
cancer cells by restoring or enhancing GJIC. Although
LY294002 indeed enhanced GJIC in numerous cell lines of
different origin, we report that the mechanism of action is not
likely via its regulation of PI3K but rather PI3K-independent
mechanisms related to protein kinase A (PKA).

with nonlabeled "acceptor'' cells for 6 hours. Donor cells were
also labeled with 5 mmol/L of CM-DiI, a red fluorescent
lipophilic dye that does not transfer between cells and was
used to mark donor cells. Calcein spread from donor to
acceptor cells was indicative of GJIC. Acceptor cells became
calcein positive but remained CM-DiI negative. All experiments
reported herein were conducted in serum-free media, although
the addition of serum did not alter the observed trends
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Flow cytometry with a BD LSRII Cell
analytic flow cytometer using BD FAC SDiva software was used
to calculate the average number of cells that received calcein
per donor cell and represented as fold change.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468,
T-47D, and C8161.9 were grown in Dulbecco’s-modified Eagle's
medium mixed 1:1 (v:v) with Ham's F-12 medium (DMEM/F12,
#11330; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 2 mmol/
L of L-glutamine, 0.2 mmol/L of nonessential amino acids with
5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435,
MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468, and T-47D are human breast
carcinoma–derived cell lines, whereas C8161.9 is a clone
derived from the C8161 human melanoma. The origin of
MDA-MB-435 has been questioned (34); however, recent literature strongly confirms its use as a breast carcinoma cell line
(35–37). S2VP10 pancreatic cancer cell line (38) was maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (#11875; Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FBS. All cell lines were tested and found to be free of
Mycoplasma spp. contamination, using a PCR-based kit
(#302108; Aligent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
Chemicals
All chemicals were prepared as stock solutions and stored
at 20 C in aliquots; working solutions were diluted fresh at
the time of experiment. Calcein-AM (#C1430) and CM-DiI
(#C7001) were obtained from Invitrogen and dissolved in
DMSO at 1-mmol/L stock. LY294002 (#PHZ1144; Invitrogen),
LY303511 (#sc-202215; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and H-89
(#B1427; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were dissolved in DMSO at 10mmol/L stock. AKT Inhibitor VII (AKTinbVII, #124014; EMD
Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) was dissolved in purified water at
10-mmol/L stock. 8-Bromo-cAMP (8-BR-cAMP, #B5386;
Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO at 1-mol/L stock. 20 ,50 -Dideoxyadenosine (#D7408; Sigma) and SQ 22,536 (#S153; Sigma)
were dissolved in DMSO at 10-mmol/L stock. Vehicle controls
(DMSO, purified water) had no effect on assays performed in
this study. All chemicals were used at concentrations that
exhibited no toxicity or morphologic changes in the cells.
GJIC assay
Calcein-AM (acetoxymethylester) passively diffuses into
cells where the acetyl methoxy group is cleaved by internal
esterases, generating a green fluorescent dye, calcein, that does
not diffuse from the cell but remains small enough to pass
through gap junctions. "Donor'' cells were loaded with 10 mmol/
L of calcein-AM for 10 minutes at 37 C/5% CO2, washed 3 times
with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), and plated

www.aacrjournals.org

Immunofluorescence
Cells were grown on glass cover slips with indicated treatments, followed by performing the GJIC assay described earlier. Cells were fixed with 3.7% neutral buffered formalin in
DPBS and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 30 minutes at 20 C. Cover slips were blocked with 5% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in DPBS and primary antibodies overnight at
4 C. Anti-connexin 43 (Cx43; #3512; Cell Signaling) 1:100
diluted in 2% BSA in DPBS was used, washed 3 times with
DPBS, followed by the addition of secondary anti-rabbit IgG
FITC-conjugated antibody (#ab27478; Sigma) at 1:160 in 2%
BSA in DPBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Cover slips were
then washed 3 times with DPBS and mounted using VECTASHIELD with DAPI (#H-1200; Vector Labs). For phosphoCREB Ser133 analysis, Alexa Fluor 488–conjugate antibody
(#9187; Cell Signaling) was used. Rabbit polyclonal IgG
(#ab27478; AbCam) was used as an isotype control. Images
were obtained on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope using
Q Imaging QICAM software for image analysis.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed on ice in 25 mmol/L of Tris-HCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mmol/L of EDTA, 50 mmol/L of
b-glycerolphosphate supplemented with 1.0 mmol/L of NaVa,
0.5 mmol/L of phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and 1 HALT
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (#78430; Thermo Scientific). For
connexin protein analysis, lysates were sonicated on ice; all
other samples were boiled at 95 C for 5 minutes. Proteins were
resolved using 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis before transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes and blocked for 1 hour in 5% nonfat dry milk in
Tris buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST). For Cx43 immunoblots, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies were diluted at 1:1,000 in 5% BSA
in TBST.
The following primary antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology: Cx43 (#3512), phospho-AKT Ser473
(#9271), pan-AKT (#4685), a-tubulin (#2125), cAMP response
element binding (CREB; #9104), phospho-CREB Ser133 (#9198).
Secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:2,500 in 5% nonfat dry
milk in TBST. Secondary horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare: anti-rabbit
(#NA934V) and anti-mouse (#NA931V). Membranes were
developed by chemiluminescence (#32106; Thermo Scientific).

Statistical analysis
Data for GJIC are presented as mean  SEM and represented as fold change. Student's t test was used for statistical
analysis between groups.

Results
Treatment of cells with LY294002 increases calcein
dye transfer
Donor cells were labeled with calcein-AM and CM-DiI
before plating with nonlabeled acceptor cells. We observed
that treatment with 10 mmol/L of LY294002 exhibited significantly higher rates of dye transfer from donor to acceptor
cells (Fig. 1A). We extended these results to a total of 5 breast
cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436,
MDA-MB-468, and T-47D), a metastatic melanoma cell line
(C8161.9), and a metastatic pancreatic cell line (S2VP10)
(Fig. 1B). All of the cell lines exhibited varying levels of dye
spread in NT conditions, but all cells displayed a significant
and consistent increase in GJIC when incubated in LY294002.
Cell lines that exhibited the lowest baseline rates of dye spread
(MDA-MB-231 and S2VP10) experienced the greatest fold
change. Calcein could be seen spreading between cells within
an hour of addition of donor cells and increased throughout
the duration of the experiment with readily noticeable differences at 6 hours.
Treatment with wortmannin and direct inhibition of
AKT do not increase GJIC compared with LY294002
To determine whether inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by
LY294002 was mediating the effects on GJIC, MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-435, and C8161.9, cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of wortmannin (50, 100, and 500 nmol/L), another

A

PI3K inhibitor. Phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 was potently
inhibited (Fig. 2A). However, in comparison with LY294002, no
increase in GJIC was noted compared with NT cells in MDA-MB231, MDA-MB-435, and C8161.9 (Fig. 2B) whereas slight decreases
were observed, signifying that inhibition of phosphorylation of
AKT was not responsible for the LY294002-mediated increase in
GJIC. To further confirm that signaling factors downstream of
AKT do not increase GJIC in these cell lines, we used a direct
inhibitor of AKT, AKTinbVII, which binds to the pleckstrin
homology domain of AKT. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-435 with AKTinbVII reduced phosphorylation of
AKT in MDA-MB-231 cells and completely abolished phosphorylation in MDA-MB-435 (Fig. 3A). However, despite these
decreases, no significant increase was observed in GJIC
(Fig. 3B). Similar to treatment with wortmannin, the cells exhibited slight decreases in GJIC upon direct AKT inhibition. These
results demonstrate that directly decreasing AKT activity does
not cause an increase in GJIC.
LY303511 increases GJIC similar to LY294002
Because PI3K/AKT signaling was ruled out as the mechanism for the LY294002-mediated increase in GJIC, we examined
whether the stated effect was related to its chemical structure.
LY303511 is structurally identical to LY294002, except for a
substitution of –O for –NH in the morpholine ring (Supplementary Fig. S2), and does not potently inhibit PI3K. Treatment of cells with LY303511 caused an increase in calcein
spread similar to levels of LY294002 (Fig. 4A). The ability of
LY303511 to increase GJIC did not occur concomitant with
inhibition of phosphorylation of AKT as measured by immunoblotting (Fig. 4B).
Cx43 is relocalized after treatment with LY294002
and LY303511
Because connexins are the functional units of connexon
channels, we examined whether LY294002 and LY303511

altered the regulation of Cx43, a connexin frequently dysregulated in breast and other cancers (39–42). Immunoblot
analysis of Cx43 levels in C8161.9 and MDA-MB-231 showed
a consistent decrease in Cx43 levels after treatment with
LY294002; however, this effect was not observed with
LY303511 (Fig. 5A and B). This result may be due to other
nonspecific effects of LY294002 that are not shared by
LY303511 or the simultaneous inhibition of PI3K. However,
significant changes in trafficking of Cx43 from the cytosol to
the plasma membrane were observed following treatment
with the LY compounds (Fig. 5C). These results show that
both LY294002 and LY303511 are capable of causing a dramatic subcellular relocalization of Cx43 and that this effect is
likely responsible for the increases in GJIC.
PKA activity is upregulated in response to LY294002
and LY303511
PKA activity leads to phosphorylation of specific residues
of Cx43, promoting its transport from the Golgi apparatus to
the plasma membrane and increasing GJIC (43–47). Because
LY294002 and LY303511 do not dramatically alter protein
levels of Cx43 but rather change Cx43 subcellular localization, we set out to determine whether an increase in PKA
activity was responsible for the enhancement in GJIC. PKA
phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB at Ser133,
which was used as an indicator of PKA activity. Using an
Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated antibody that binds CREB when
phosphorylated at Ser133, a significant increase in fluorescence within the nucleus following a 2-hour treatment with
LY294002 or LY303511 was observed (Fig. 6A), indicative of
PKA activation. To determine how quickly PKA is activated,
nuclear extracts were isolated following treatment with
LY294002 at varying time points. Increased phosphorylation
of CREB was evident as early as 15 minutes posttreatment
(Fig. 6B). In support of PKA playing a role in increased GJIC
in these cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of 8-BR-cAMP, a cell-permeable analogue
of cAMP that upregulates PKA activity. 8-BR-cAMP
increased GJIC in a dose-dependent manner in these cells
(Fig. 6C). To determine whether PKA activity was responsible for the LY294002-mediated enhancement in GJIC, cells
were cotreated with LY294002 (10 mmol/L) and the PKA
inhibitor H89 (10 mmol/L). Addition of H89 caused a significant reduction in GJIC induced by LY294002 (Fig. 6D and
E), indicating that upregulation of PKA by LY294002 is at
least, in part, responsible for the increase in GJIC.

GJIC is a complex process capable of inhibiting or
promoting the migratory and invasive qualities of cancer
cells. Importantly, GJIC is defined in a context-dependent
manner, because tumor cells can form homotypic (tumor
cell–tumor cell) or heterotypic (tumor cell–host cell) interactions using multiple permutations of greater than 20
mammalian connexins (48). Further complexity exists
because connexin proteins are now known to mediate
multiple cellular effects independent of their involvement

in gap junctions. Because a number of studies show that
restoration of gap junctional proteins and/or GJIC can
reverse tumorigenicity or metastatic potential (18, 19, 21,
23–25), understanding how GJIC is dysregulated in cancer
cells and delineating such (dys)regulatory signaling pathways will allow insight into defining the role(s) of GJIC in
tumor progression and metastasis.
Because the metastasis suppressor BRMS1 inhibits metastasis in numerous models, and has previously been reported to
inhibit AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 while increasing GJIC,
we initially set out to determine whether a link between these
2 effects existed. We utilized 2 PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and
wortmannin, to recapitulate the effect of BRMS1 on AKT
phosphorylation in cells that do not express detectable endogenous BRMS1, followed by measuring GJIC.
Treatment of cells with the relatively more "selective''
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (49) significantly increased GJIC
in multiple cancer cell lines. No clear trends were observed
in metastatic potential and baseline GJIC between the cell
lines used. For example, MDA-MB-231 and C8161.9 are both
highly metastatic in murine models; however, MDA-MB-231
exhibited low baseline GJIC whereas C8161.9 displayed
moderate levels (Fig. 1A), which was higher in comparison
with some of the nonmetastatic cell lines (i.e., MDA-MB468). However, regardless of baseline communication rates,
all cell lines experienced a significant increase in GJIC when
treated with LY294002. Unexpectedly, treatment of the same
cell lines with wortmannin did not increase GJIC, raising
doubts regarding the connection between PI3K and GJIC.
This was further substantiated when cells treated with a
direct AKT inhibitor failed to induce GJIC as well. Interestingly, inhibition of AKT with these treatments caused
decreases in GJIC, signifying that AKT appears to be partially
involved in the regulation of GJIC; however, the magnitude
of these changes did not match the level of GJIC increase
observed with LY294002. Reasoning that the effect of
LY294002 could be due to signaling through the inositol
trisphosphate arm, cells were treated with phospholipase C

inhibitors without increasing GJIC (data not shown). Taken
together, these data required exploration of potential PI3Kindependent effects of LY294002. To facilitate dissection of
the possible nonspecific effects, a chemically related molecule, LY303511 (50), was used. We found that LY303511
enhanced GJIC similarly to LY294002.
We examined a number of published dose-dependent,
nonspecific effects reported for these compounds including
inhibition of casein kinase 2 [Ref. 51; Supplementary Fig. S3]
and increased intracellular calcium levels [Ref. 52; Supplementary Fig. S4A and B]; however, none of the effects tested
corresponded with GJIC enhancement.
Although there is a correlation between connexin levels and
GJIC in many cancer cells, functional connexons are
assembled by, among other posttranslational modifications,
phosphorylation through protein kinases (53, 54). Because we
observed relatively slight changes in Cx43 protein levels after
treatment with LY294002 and LY303511, but highly substantial
changes in Cx43 localization to the plasma membrane, we
hypothesized that Cx43 was being modified posttranslationally and that these effects were likely to be inducing the effect
on GJIC. Among the most well-defined phosphorylating molecules resulting in connexin trafficking to the plasma membrane is PKA (43–47). Although Davies et al. previously
reported that LY294002 did not directly affect PKA activity
in cell-free kinase assays (51), it is important to emphasize that
they could not preclude indirect effects of LY294002 on PKA
activation (as would occur in whole cells). We consistently
found a robust increase in CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 by
both immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses, confirming that PKA was indeed activated by both LY294002
and LY303511. These results agree with our data involving
relocalization of Cx43 to the plasma membrane and a corresponding increase in GJIC that could be expected upon
activation of PKA.
Further strengthening our hypothesis that PKA activation
by LY294002/LY303511 enhanced homotypic GJIC are observations that cells treated with 8-BR-cAMP (an agonist of PKA)

or H89 (a PKA inhibitor) increased or decreased GJIC, respectively. Because Davies et al. showed that LY294002 did not
directly affect PKA activity (51), we set out to determine
whether LY294002/LY303511 induced activation of adenylate
cyclase that would lead to increased cAMP levels and PKA
activation. Pretreatment of cells with the adenylate cyclase
inhibitors 20 ,50 -dideoxyadenosine and SQ 22,536 (Fig. 6F and
G) did not reduce the ability of LY294002 to induce GJIC in
contrast to direct PKA inhibition with H89. These data suggest
that LY294002/LY303511 are acting downstream of adenylate

cyclase, most likely through other indirect cellular interactions that have yet to be determined.
Because H89 significantly reduced LY294002/LY303511mediated increase in GJIC, it seems that activation of PKA
is, at least in part, responsible for the changes in GJIC.
Collectively, our results highlight the fact that cancer cells
may reduce GJIC not by causing a downregulation of connexin
expression but rather by altering the regulatory pathways
related to connexin function and/or localization. This can
readily be appreciated because we induced an increase in GJIC

in 7 cancer cell lines without exogenous expression of a
connexin gene. In addition, with literature building on membrane-independent roles of connexin proteins, it is possible
that cancer cells may not just cause a relocalization of
connexins away from the plasma membrane but utilize these
proteins for other membrane-independent tasks related to
cancer cell function. Although this report is limited to observations with Cx43, these results warrant further investigation
of other connexins and highlight an important principle to
consider for future studies in this area.
Although not a central tenet for the studies recorded here, our
data highlight the caution necessary when interpreting results
using any pharmaceutical reagent (in this case LY294002), no

matter how selective that agent is expected to be. More important, the findings also have important therapeutic implications
for adjuvant cancer therapies. Because GJIC restoration was
possible by exogenous drug treatment, it may be possible to
accomplish the same in vivo. Cell-permeable compounds such
as LY294002 and LY303511 that can induce GJIC in cancer cells
may be further developed for treatments aimed at increasing
the penetrance of chemotherapeutic agents throughout a
tumor via an increase in gap junction activity. Doing so would
be much easier to accomplish with a drug than by attempting to
reexpress or overexpress connexins in tumor cells. However,
whether PKA acts as a true convergence point for dysregulation
in cancer cells remains to be determined.
