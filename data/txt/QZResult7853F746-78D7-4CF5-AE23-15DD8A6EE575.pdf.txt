ABSTRACT
FBXW7 mutations occur in a variety of human cancers including colorectal cancer
(CRC). Elucidating its mechanism of action has become crucial for cancer therapy;
however, it is also complicated by the fact that FBXW7 can influence many pathways
due to its role as an E3-ubiquitin ligase in proteasome degradation. FBXW7 and TP53
are tumour suppressors intensively implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Deletion
mutations in these two genes in animal models mark the progression from adenoma
to carcinoma. Although still largely unknown, the last defense mechanism against
CRC at the molecular level could be through a synergistic effect of the two genes.
The underlying mechanism requires further investigation. In our laboratory, we have
used a phospho-kinase profiler array to illustrate a potential molecular link between
FBXW7 and p53 in CRC cells. In vitro and in vivo assessments demonstrated aberrant
induction of phosphorylated p53 at Serine 15 [phospho-p53(Ser15)] in human
FBXW7-deficient CRC cells as compared to their FBXW7-wild-type counterparts.
FBXW7 loss in HCT116 cells promoted resistance to oxaliplatin. Immunoblotting
data further confirmed that reduction of phospho-p53(Ser15) may contribute to the
decreased efficacy of therapy in FBXW7-mutated CRC cells. The findings may suggest
the applicability of phospho-p53(Ser15) as an indicative marker of FBXW7-mutations.
Phospho-p53(Ser15) regulation by FBXW7 E3-ligase activity could provide important
clues for understanding FBXW7 behavior in tumour progression and grounds for its
clinical applicability thereafter.

FBXW7 constitutes one of the four subunits of SCF (SKP1cullin-F-box)-E3 ubiquitin protein ligase complex, which
functions in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. To
date, a wide array of SCFFBXW7 E3-ligase substrates have
been identified and characterized, including cyclin E [8, 9],
c-Myc [10, 11], c-Jun [12, 13], Notch [14], Presenilin
[15], SREBP [16], Aurora-A [17], Krüppel-like factor
5 (KLF5) [18], DEK proto-oncogene [19], and peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)

INTRODUCTION
FBXW7 (F-box and WD repeat domaincontaining 7, also known as FBW7, AGO, SEL10, CDC4)
and TP53 are widely-known tumour suppressors and
their genetic alterations lead to malignant transformation,
metastatic spread and poor survival of cancer sufferers
[1–4]. They are among the most commonly mutated genes
after K-RAS and APC in colorectal cancer (CRC) [5–7].

[20]. These and several other SCFFBXW7 E3-ligase substrates
play central roles in cell division, growth, differentiation,
cell-fate determination and maintenance of the phenotype
of a variety of types of stem cells [3, 21–24]. There are
several comprehensive reviews on FBXW7 functions as
an E3-ligase in ubiquitin mediated proteasome-degradation
[1, 3, 8–14].
Recent literature has reported the synergistic
contribution of FBXW7 and TP53 to the suppression
of gastrointestinal cancer [15, 16]. FBXW7 has been
identified as a transcriptional target of TP53 and lower
expression levels of FBXW7 upon TP53-mutations have
been reported [15, 17, 18]. Parallel loss of the two tumoursuppressors was found to cooperate in tumourigenesis [16,
18, 19]. In line with such data, is the fact that most natural
FBXW7 mutations in cancers are shown to exhibit a TP53
mutation [6, 7, 18]. Despite previous reports that FBXW7
is transcriptionally controlled by p53, little is known about
their synergistic involvement in the molecular etiology of
CRC. The p53-dependent relationship, reported in current
literature, does not fully reveal the interplay between p53
and FBXW7, and p53 activity modulated by FBXW7dependent mechanism(s) is yet unidentified.
Considering the multiple challenges to treatment
response posed by a mutated tumour suppressor gene,
elucidating FBXW7’s mechanisms of action could
be a breakthrough for cancer therapy. More recently,
a number of groups demonstrated FBXW7-mediated
drug resistance in human cancer cell lines via FBXW7suppression and increased levels of pro-survival factor
MCL1 and mTOR [20–23]. Wang et al. showed that loss
of FBXW7 leads to rapamycin drug-resistant by inducing
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in CRC cells
[21]. However, it is still unclear whether this mechanism
explains FBXW7 loss-conferred resistance to other
standard chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
cisplatin and oxaliplatin.
Ultraviolet (UV) and DNA damage agents induced
protein phosphorylation is one of the earliest events
in modifying protein stability, and FBXW7 E3-ligase
mediates the degradation of proteins in a phosphorylationdependent manner [1, 3, 8, 24]. FBXW7 influences many
pathways due to its role as an E3-ligase in proteasomedegradation. Loss of FBXW7 function is likely to result
in failed regulation of its downstream targets and cellular
acquisition of the hallmarks of cancer.
This study investigated the relationship between
deregulation of FBXW7 E3-ligase activity and p53
phosphorylation. Our data show aberrant induction of
phosphorylated-p53 at Serine 15 [phospho-p53(Ser15)]
in human CRC cells that lacked FBXW7 as compared to
their FBXW7 wild-type counterparts. TP53 is a key player
in determining the response of colorectal cancer cells to
oncogenic stress and chemotherapy by oxaliplatin and
5-FU [25]. UV-radiation but not oxaliplatin drug induced
phospho-p53(Ser15) in CRC cells with FBXW7 deletion.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Despite the accumulation of phospho-p53(Ser15) in
mutant-FBXW7 CRC-tissues, FBXW7 does not directly
interact with phospho-p53(Ser15) for degradation. Posttranslational modification of p53 by its phosphorylation
on Serine 15 has been one of the most extensively studied
functional switch mechanisms in response to genotoxic
stress. Serine15 residue of p53 is phosphorylated allowing
p53 to be released from its normal physiological function
[26, 27]. Subsequently, p53 stabilizes in the nucleus to
act as a transcriptional activator for tumour suppression,
implicating phospho-p53(Ser15) as a marker of FBXW7associated carcinogenesis.

RESULTS
FBXW7 loss leads to induction of
p53-phosphorylation at Serine-15
Ablation of FBXW7 was shown to elevate the level
of phosphorylated-substrate protein and its downstream
signaling proteins. Such a phenomenon could inform
about the disease mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis
and the cellular pathways affected by homeostatic
deregulation caused by an FBXW7 mutation. Posttranslational modification of p53 by phosphorylation may
be an important mechanism underlying regulation of p53
stabilization and function. However, the molecular and
cellular mechanisms that link FBXW7 and p53 following
phosphorylation are unclear. An in vitro human phosphokinase array (HPKPA) with multiple p53-phosphoacceptor
sites (Figure 1A), was used to assess changes to the
protein phosphorylation profile. We and others have
reported that HCT116 and DLD-1 cell-lines harboring
wild-type FBXW7; FBXW7(+/+), or inactivated FBXW7;
FBXW7(−/−), have the characteristics of human CRC
cells without or with FBXW7-mutation [19, 20, 23, 28].
In particular, they provide an excellent in vitro model to
delineate the molecular mechanisms that contribute to
neoplasia. Remarkably, in the absence of FBXW7, both
HCT116 and DLD-1 showed a substantial increase in
p53 phosphorylation at Serine-15 as compared to control
cells (Figure 1F), while phosphorylation at Serine-46 and
Serine-392 remain unchanged (Figure 1, 1B vs. 1D and 1C
vs. 1E). Western blot analysis showed an increase of p53
phosphorylated at Ser-15 in FBXW7(−/−) versus wild-type
FBXW7(+/+) (Figure 1G).
The Ser15 phosphorylation site is evolutionarily
conserved and corresponds to Ser18 of murine p53,
which has not been as extensively examined as that of
human p53. Mice harbouring an fbxw7 allele in which
exon5 was flanked by two loxP sites were crossed to
villin-cre transgenic mice as previously described [28,
29] (Figure 2A). We examined p53 phosphorylation in
mouse intestinal tissues harboring fbxw7 deletion. We
detected enhanced phosphorylation of p53 at Serine-18

FBXW7-dependent induction of phosphop53(Ser15) in CRC cells treated with UV
radiation

with the phospho-specific p53 (Ser15) antibody [30].
Phosphorylation of Serine-18 regulates distinct p53
functions in mice, including p53-dependent transcripton,
apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest after DNA damage
[30]. There was accumulation of phosphorylated p53
at Serine-18 but despite the high levels of phosphop53(Ser18), there was only a very small increase in total
levels of p53 (Figure 2B).

FBXW7 is involved in the control of genetic
instability [16, 19]. A strong association has been found
between phosphorylation of p53 on Serine-15 and
exposure to UV irradiation [31, 32]. In order to evaluate

(Figure 4B). This may suggest that phospho-p53(Ser15)
could be detected in cancer and crypt-based cells which
exhibit poor differentiation in contrast to the cells of the
villi. Collectively, compared to the negligible expression
in control CRC tissues, remarkable accumulation of
phospho-p53(Ser15) protein was observed in FBXW7mutant samples.
Even though TP53 mutations have been reported in
over 50% of human tumours [33], it was not possible to
profile the TP53 status by molecular methods in the CRCtissues utilized in our previous studies (Ian Tomlinson,
personal communication) [28, 29]. However, our data
show heterogeneous pattern of p53-staining. There was
more p53 staining at the invasion front of CRCs with a
small increase (not statistically significant) in total levels
of p53 (p = 0.072) among CRC tissues with FBXW7mutation (Figure 6, 6A-6E & data not shown). Of interest
was the fact that the only controlled variable for the
wild-type CRC-tissues examined was the presence of
intact FBXW7. Similarly, the only controlled variable
for the FBXW7-mutated tissues was the presence of an
FBXW7 mutation with other cancer mutations remaining
unidentified. Regardless of the unknown nature of the
non-FBXW7 mutations, the presence of an FBXW7mutation alone was adequate to give a consistent pattern of
phospho-p53(Ser15) induction (mean-range; 1.67–2.33).
Statistical analysis confirmed that phopsho-p53(Ser15)induction in FBXW7-mutant tissues was highly significant
(p < 0.0005) (Figure 5B). Although only a limited number
of samples was available, the results pointed towards
the suitability of phospho-p53(Ser15) induction as an
independent indicative marker of CRC with FBXW7mutation.

phospho-p53(Ser15) induction’s dependence on FBXW7
in UV-treated CRC cells, we used HCT116 cells harboring
wild-type and inactivated FBXW7. Immunofluorescence
(IF) staining showed nuclear phospho-p53(Ser15) was
almost undetectable in control HCT116FBXW7(+/+) cells, but
was markedly increased in FBXW7-null HCT116FBXW7(−/−)
cells (Figure 3, 3E vs. 3B; 3F vs. 3C and 3M). This finding
was supported by Western blot (WB) analysis (Figure 3N).
In addition, we applied UV-treatment to the HCT116 cells
to provide clearly distinguishable results. Treatment with
UV-radiation enhanced phospho-p53(Ser15) induction in
both the wild-type and FBXW7-mutated cells (Figure 3,
3H & 3K; 3M, right panel). Nonetheless, phosphop53(Ser15) in HCT116FBXW7(−/−) cells was markedly higher
than that in HCT116FBXW7(+/+) cells, with both cytoplasmic
and nuclear localization (Figure 3, 3K vs. 3H; 3L vs. 3I).
The WB data were consistent with the IF results (Figure 3,
3M and 3N). Our results validated the enrichment of
phospho-p53(Ser15)-induction in FBXW7-deficient
CRC cell lines. Subsequently we further investigated
whether phospho-p53(Ser15) could provide diagnostic
and/or prognostic value for CRC-biopsies with FBXW7mutations.

Phospho-p53(Ser15) protein accumulation in
human CRC-tissues with FBXW7-mutation
We carried out in vivo investigations to validate
the phospho-p53(Ser15) induction in CRC tissues
excised from patients with FBXW7-mutated tumours.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) comparison of phosphop53(Ser15) expression in wild-type and FBXW7-mutated
human CRC-tissue was carried out. The intensity of the
IHC staining observed in the two tissue types (wildtype vs. mutants for FBXW7), was evaluated in a semiquantitative manner. In CRC tissues, the architecture
of the gut wall was chaotic as expected for both cancer
specimens: FBXW7- wild-type (control) and -mutant
(Figure 4, 4C-4F). Irregular and distorted crypts were
evident invading the submucosal area of CRC tissues
(Figure 4E, 4F). Expression of phospho-p53(Ser15)
protein was completely lost in FBXW7 wild-type tissue
(Figure 4C, 4D) [mean staining-score; 0.33 (Figure 5A)],
irrespective of the tumour-type or the presence of p53mutation. On the contrary, FBXW7-mutant CRC showed
substantial of phospho-p53(Ser15) induction in the
mucosa and early submucosal invasion (Figure 4E, 4F)
[mean staining-score; 1.87 (Figure 5A)]. Healthy human
small bowel tissue, which was available as an additional
control, exhibited a consistent distribution of phosphop53(Ser15) protein in the mucosal lining of the structured
bowel wall architecture (Figure 4A, 4B) [mean stainingscore; 1.50 (Figure 5A)]. In general, phospho-p53(Ser15)
was enriched in the intestinal crypts, but was much
less in the differentiated cell types residing in the villi

Loss of FBXW7 leads to oxaliplatin drug
resistance in CRC cells through differential
expressions of the TP53 family of transcription
factors
To evaluate the cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin in CRCcells harboring FBXW7-deletion, both HCT116FBXW7(+/+)
and HCT116FBXW7(−/−) cells were treated with increasing
concentration of oxaliplatin (0.05 to 25.6 μM), separately,
for 3 days. SRB assays were performed, dose-response
curves generated and IC50 values calculated. The assay
was carried out in triplicate and repeated at least three
times. The Student’s t-test was used to value the statisticalsignificance. The results showed that FBXW7-mutated
HCT116FBXW7(−/−) cells conferred resistance to oxaliplatin
drug (Figure 7, 7A-7C). IC50 of HCT116FBXW7(−/−) for
oxaliplatin was almost four times higher than the IC50
of the corresponding FBXW7-wild-type cell line. Indeed,
the IC50 of HCT116FBXW7(+/+) cells for oxaliplatin was
about 0.6567 μM and that of HCT116FBXW7−/− cells was
about  2.398 μM (Figure 7A). The results show that

FBXW7-deleted cells demonstrated higher tolerance to the
effects of oxaliplatin drug (Figure 7, 7B, 7C & data not
shown). IC50 values for control HCT116 cells with wildtype FBXW7 are consistent with previously reported values
for the same drugs [34]. The data suggest that FBXW7 loss
confers HCT116 cells resistance to oxaliplatin.
To address the hypothesis of an existing relationship
between mutated-FBXW7 and phopsho-p53(Ser15)
protein in response to drug treatment, the expression level
of phopsho-p53(Ser15) protein was assessed by Western
blotting (Figure 7D). In contrast to UV-irradiation,
Western blotting results showed that expression
of phospho-p53(Ser15) decreased after oxaliplatin
treatment (Figure 7D) in HCT116FBXW7−/− cells. Hence,
the decreased phospho-p53(Ser15) on its own might not
affect the cell’s ability to induce apoptosis. To assess
the impact of loss of FBXW7 and TP53-mediated gene
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression on HCT116FBXW7(−/−) cells behavior, mRNA
was isolated from equal numbers of HCT116FBXW7(+/+)
and HCT116FBXW7(−/−) cells (Figure S1). The differential
expression of members of the TP53/TP63/TP73 family of
transcription factors and apoptosis-related TP53-mediated
gene expression (TP53AIP1 and TP53BP2) was analyzed
by real-time-PCR [35] (Table S1). The analysis highlights
significant up-regulation of TP63 in HCT116FBXW7(−/−)
cells while both TP53 and TP73 expression appeared to
be down-regulated (Figure 7E). Apoptosis-stimulating
protein of TP53AIP1 and TP53BP2 expression was
simultaneously down-regulated (Figure 7E). The result
may suggest that induction of phopsho-p53(Ser15) by
loss of SCFFBXW7-E3-ligase activity could contribute to
other pathways function to block the p53 activation [27]
and consequently decreased efficacy of therapy in chemoresistant CRCs.

Phospho-p53(Ser15) may not be a direct target
of SCFFBXW7-E3 ubiquitin ligase

Immunoprecipitation (PI) of either FLAG epitope-tagged
p53 or GFP fused-FBXW7α showed no interaction
between these proteins (Figure 8C). These data suggest
that FBXW7 does not act directly, but indirectly regulates
the abundance of phospho-p53(Ser15).
Furthermore, high levels of phosphorylation of
p53 at Serine-15(Ser15), modulate cell cycle checkpoint
kinase Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and
Ataxia-Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) that
impede MDM2 binding to p53 and subsequently
promote p53 accumulation and activation in response
to DNA damage [32, 36]. Phosphorylation of Serine 15
is considered to be an initiating and nucleating event in
p53 activation, especially in combination with Ser20
and Thr18 phosphorylation. ATM and ATR kinase
however, in turn, activates the effector kinase such Chk2
and ERK to phosphorylate Ser15, along with several
other residues in p53 [37–39]. Following p53 Ser15

In the present studies, we demonstrated through
several lines of evidence that FBXW7 ablation in CRC
cells results in the accumulation of phospho-p53(Ser15).
The mechanism of this is still uncertain. We therefore
studied the FBXW7/p53-correlation further to validate
the phospho-p53(Ser15) phenomenon. Consistent with
the HPKPA results, mutations at either Ser46 (S46A) or
Ser392 (S392A) did not stabilize phospho-p53(Ser15) in
the presence of FBXW7 (Figure 8A). Western blotting
data with cells that overexpress the p53(S15A) mutant
protein also determined the anti-phospho-p53(Ser15)
antibody specificity (Figure 8A). Furthermore, coexpression of FBXW7 decreased the steady-state levels
of p53(wt) (Figure 8B). We next examined whether the
FBXW7 protein would bind to p53 protein and vice versa.

phosphorylation, protein kinase CK1 can also sequentially
phosphorylate Thr18 using the phosphorylated Ser15 as
a recognition determinant [40, 41]. Given these findings,
we examined the level of these kinases in both HCT116
and DLD-1 cells lacking and expressing FBXW7. Both
Chk2 phosphorylation at Ser516, and Thr68 protein
levels were slightly increased in HCT116(−/−) and
DLD-1(−/−) cells compared with control (+/+) cells,
whereas CK1α level remarkably increased, especially its
long isoform (Figure 8D). Total (phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated) levels of ERK 1/2 remained unchanged
(Figure 8D). CK1α has two alternatively spliced isoforms,
one short (known as CK1αS) and one long (known as
CK1αL). Both human CK1α isoforms contain a common
12-amino-acid short insert located at the carboxyl terminus,
whilst CK1αL itself includes a 28-amino-acid long insert
(i.e. encoded from exon 5 of CK1αL gene) located in the
central kinase catalytic domain [42, 43]. Therefore, human
CK1α isoforms are composed of 365 or 337 amino acids
due to presence or absence of the exon 5. Consistent with
Western blotting data, immunofluorescent staining showed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

remarkably increased expression levels of a nuclear splice
form of CK1α (Figure 8E). Further analysis, beyond the
current scope of this paper, would be required to validate
the possibility that FBXW7 could modulate phospho-p53
via targeting CK1α for degradation.

DISCUSSION
Our experiments do not point to phosphop53(Ser15) as a direct binding substrate for FBXW7 E3ubiquitin ligase degradation. Cellular stress generated by
accumulation of FBXW7-substrates (for example, Cyclin
E and c-Myc) may induce the TP53 pathway via phosphop53(Ser15) induction [44, 45]. However, in the colon/
intestine, we and others have shown that expression of
c-Myc and Cyclin E were unaffected by loss of intestinal/
colonic-fbxw7 [18, 28, 29, 46]. This could suggest a
potential route for FBXW7 regulating phosphorylated
p53 protein expression through controlling upstream
kinases. Considering the fact that CK1α is an essential

regulator of p53 phosphorylation [40, 41, 47], this study
provides the possibility that FBXW7 could modulate
phospho-p53 via targeting CK1α for degradation.
Therefore, it could be postulated that loss of FBXW7
could result in CK1α accrual in vivo, which subsequently
leads to increased p53 stabilization and activation.
Indeed, we and other recently demonstrated that neither
FBXW7 abolishment nor CK1α deletion in vivo caused
immediate intestinal tumour formation [28, 29, 48],
possibly due to compensation from the p53 pathway
[16, 48]. Furthermore, we have previously shown an
up-regulation of β-catenin in HCT116(FBXW7−/−)
cells [28]. β-catenin is phosphorylated by CK1 (EMBO
J. 2002 Apr 2;21(7):1733–42). Moreover, CK1α role
in malignancy is still ambiguous as it was previously
reported as an oncogene [49] and it may also function
as a tumour suppressor gene [50]. There are, as yet, no
in vivo or in vitro data showing a direct link between
CK1α. and p53 Ser15. On the other hand, our data
suggest that FBXW7 could be an upstream regulator of
p53 and CK1α. Considering the possibility that CK1α
might act as an important co-effector protein linking
FBXW7 and other cellular pathways, such as Wnt and
p53, in this respect, we may hypothesis a synergistic
role for FBXW7 and p53 in suppression of intestinal
tumourigenicity and metastasis. Moreover, of interest,
are the observations that suggest that wild-type TP53 in
tumours may not have the same transcriptional activity
often found in their non-transformed counterpart
tissues [51]. Hence, further studies are required to prove
a possible association between CK1α and p53(Ser15),
and provide significant evidence for CK1α-mediated upregulation phospho-p53(Ser15) in tumours with FBXW7
mutations. Furthermore, these data may also prompt
us to reconsider the status of p53 phosphorylation in
relation to expression of different isoforms of CK1α
kinase. This may be explained by its diverse roles in
different cellular processes [52, 53] and by the distinct
functions and subcellular locations of its two splicing
variants.
Taken together, the results from cytotoxicity and
viability assays suggest that loss of FBXW7 function can
confer resistance to DNA-damage agent oxaliplatin in
CRC cells. FBXW7 might act as a core factor in different
mechanisms used by cancer cells to become resistant to
chemotherapeutic drugs. Determining these mechanisms
of eluding DNA damaging agents, probably through the
modulation of SCFFBXW7 protein substrate(s), may be
crucial for understanding tumour development and its
response to current chemotherapy. It has been shown that
p53(Ser15) phosphorylation can stimulate p53 activity.
In contrast, it was also found that phosphorylation of
Serine-15 can block binding of p53 to transcription
Factor II D, and inhibit the formation of a DNA promoter
complex for transcription [27].

Widely-accepted evidence reveals that tumours
exhibit a different type and substantially a greater degree
of p53-phosphorylation than normal cells rendering
in this way the tumour suppressor nonfunctional [51].
Recently, reports showed that p53 up-regulates FBXW7
[15, 17] whereas it represses ZEB family transcriptional
regulator (ZEB1 and ZEB2), implicated in epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) [54]. Western blotting and
immunohistochemistry data did not exhibit statistically
significant differences in total p53 protein levels in
HCT116FBXW7−/− cells and FBXW7-mutated CRC tissues,
compared with parental HCT116 cells which have
functional wild-type TP53, and FBXW7-wild-type CRC
tissues (Figure 5). There is a lot of research activity as
to whether, and how, TP53 family members interact
or conflict with each other in apoptosis and tumour
suppression [55]. Induction of death of neurons and
mouse embryo fibroblasts by p53 requires coalescence
of p63 and p73 [56], while not required for the induction
of apoptosis in T cells [57]. DeltaNp63 isoform of p63
have been associated with transcriptional activation of
ATM and p53 Serine-15 phosphorylation in immortalized
human keratinocytes [58]. However, consistent with
the recent published data [59], we did not observe any
significant changes in levels of ATM kinase from protein
extracts isolated from HCT116 and DLD-1 cell lines with
FBXW7(−/−) and FBXW7(+/+) alleles in a WB analysis
(data not shown). Whether FBXW7-mutation induces EMT
via p53/p63/p73 regulation or vice versa, and provides a
possible explanation for the prominent chemoresistance
observed in CRC, remains to be elucidated.
Based on our results, further work to investigate the
cellular mechanisms implicated in the phospho-p53(Ser15)/
FBXW7 phenomenon are necessary to provide more insight
into the underlying mechanisms. Following validation
of the phospho-p53(Ser15) protein induction, an enquiry
was raised whether such stimulation serves any function
within the tumour other than its use as an indicative marker
of FBXW7-mutations. Does the phospho-p53(Ser15)
induction serve any role in the FBXW7-associated
carcinogenesis due to a likely gain/loss/change of P53/
P63/P73 function? Our current data as presented are limited
to few tumour specimens. To assess if FBXW7 mutation
confers resistance to oxaliplatin relevant to prognosis or
treatment response, further studies should be carried out
using a large number of patients treated with oxaliplatin.

laboratory, Wellcome Trust Centre, University of Oxford.
The ethical and R&D approval for use of human tissue
was obtained from the local research-ethics committee and
Trust R&D office, in Oxford and Nottingham, as described
previously [28].

Antibodies freshly prepared by diluting original primary
or secondary-antibody appropriately in 1% BSA/PBS.
Tissues then incubated with Avidin-Biotin-Complex
for 30 min as per manufacturer’s instruction, followed by
PBS wash for 3 × 3 mins. Staining visualized using DAB
(3, 3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride-dehydrate)-Kit
[BioGenex] by chromogenic-reaction with DAB-solution
for 2~10 mins according to manufacturer’s instruction.
Sections monitored microscopically until optimalstaining was achieved, and the DAB-reaction quenched
by dH2O-dilution. Slides counterstained with 60%-LightHaematoxylin (v/v). Primary-antibody concentrations
were as follows: anti-p53 (1:50; Dako, DO-7-clone)
[61] and anti-phospho-p53(Ser15) (1:100; Santa-Cruz;
sc-101762) or anti-phospho-p53(Ser15) (1:100; Cell
Signaling; D4S1H) [62, 63]. For IF, samples exposed to
goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 594
(1/500; Invitrogen) and/or rabbit anti-mouse antibodies
conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 488 (1/500; Invitrogen).

Human phospho-kinase profiler array (HPKPA)
In order to identify signaling pathways altered
by FBXW7, a human phospho-kinase array kit (R&D
Systems, UK) was used. This consists of a nitrocellulose
membrane (Figure 1A) having control antibodies
against phosphorylated proteins which are spotted in
duplicate. It allows the detection of the relative levels of
phosphorylation of protein/kinase phosphorylation sites
(antibodies for those sites were selected and spotted in
duplicate on nitrocellulose membrane).
Two CRC cell lines (HCT116 and DLD-1
cells) harboring wild-type-FBXW7; FBXW7(+/+),
or inactivated FBXW7(−/−), were rinsed with PBS,
solubilized in the Lysis Buffer supplied with kit and
with Halt Protease and EDTA-free Phosphatase Inhibitor
Cocktail (100X) was added as 1:100 concentration
(Pierce, UK). The lysates were gently rocked at 4°C for
30 min and then centrifuged at 14, 000x g. The protein
was quantified using the Bradford protein assay (BioRad) and the four different cell lysates were adjusted
to 100 μg in 1ml of array buffer supplied with the kit.
After blocking the nitrocellulose membrane by rocking
in Buffer 1 for 1 hour at room temperature, diluted lysate
contain 100 μg protein was added and incubated on a
rocking platform overnight at 4°C. Washing with wash
buffer was followed by adding the diluted detection
antibody cocktail to corresponding part of the membrane
and incubation for 2 hours at room temperature on a
rocking platform. Another wash was carried and the
membranes were incubated with diluted StreptavidinHRP for 30 min then followed by another washing. The
spots were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) using the FlourChem FC2 imaging system (Alpha
Innotech).

Ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation
Prior to UV-treatment, the cells were starved in
RPMI-medium containing 0.1%-FBS for 24 hrs. UVtreatment performed at 50 kJ/m2 using SpectrolinkerXL-1000 UV Cross-linker device (Spectromics).
Following UV-irradiation, cells incubated for 60 mins in
complete-RPMI-medium at 37.5°C, 5%-CO2.

Cell culture, transfection, and Western blot
(WB) analysis
In vitro analyses were performed by using HCT116
human colon carcinoma cell line deleted for FBXW7 in
single (HCT116FBXW7+/−) or both alleles (HCT116FBXW7−/−)
in parallel to the control HCT116FBXW7+/+ cell line, which
were extensively characterized in our laboratory and
others [19, 20, 28]. Transfection of cell lines HEK293
or HCT116 depending on the experiment with DNA
plasmids were carried out using Ployethylenimine (PEI)
transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The protein was extracted using RIPA buffer,
as described previously [28, 60]. Eluted proteins in SDSloading buffer (2×), boiled at 95°C for 4 mins, separated
on 8%-SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidenefluoride-membranes. p53 mutants were generated with
the QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
(Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Proteins immunoblotted with primary-antibodies; rabbit
phospho-p53(Ser15) (1:1000; Cell Signaling), anti-p53
(1:1000; Dako), anti-phospho-p53(Ser15) (1:1000; SantaCruz), mouse phospho-p53(Ser18) antibody (1:500;
R&D), Fbxw7 (1:500; Bethyl Laboratories), β-Actin
(1/10, 000; Abcam), and phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2),
p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2), pChk2 (T68), pChk2 (S516), (all
1:1000) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
immunofluorescence (IF)
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were dewaxed,
rehydrated as described [28, 60]. Peroxidase activity in
tissue samples quenched with 1.6%H2O2 (5.33 ml of
30%H2O2 [Fisher] added in 94.67 ml of PBS) for 10 min,
and sections washed with PBS for 5 min. The specimen
region on each section slide circled with a wax PAP-pen,
and incubated for 30 min in 100 μl Serum-blocking buffer/
slide (10%[v/v] normal-serum and 1%[w/v] BovineSerum-Albumin (BSA) in PBS. The sections incubated in
primary and biotinylated-secondary-antibody for 1 hr at
RT, respectively, followed by PBS wash for 3 × 3 mins.

and CKIα from Novus. Secondary-antibodies were HRPlinked goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies
(1/10, 000; Santa-Cruz). Blots were developed using ECL
(GE-Healthcare). Experiments repeated on at least two
occasions.

For qRT-PCR analysis [28], total RNA was
isolated from CRC cells using TRIZOL reagent (SigmaAldrich) and purified using the RNeasy mini kit including
DNase (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Figure S1). cDNA synthesis was performed
using Superscript reagents (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time
PCR was accomplished with SYBR green incorporation
(Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG w/ROX;
Invitrogen) using an ABI7900HT (Applied Biosystems),
and the data were analyzed using SDS 2.3 software
(Applied Biosystems). Results were normalized to those
obtained with GAPDH, and data are presented as fold
induction/repression over parental cells. Details of primers
used are shown in Table S1. All assays were performed in
triplicate at least three times.

Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids
encoding GFP-FBXW7-α [28] and FLAG-p53 (WT)
[64]. 30 hrs after transfection, we used 100 μl of antiFLAG-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) to
immunoprecipitate p53 or anti-GFP antibody-conjugated
agarose beads (MBL International) to immunoprecipitate
FBXW7 from whole cell extracts of the HEK293T
cells using RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl) with protease
inhibitors. After IP, the beads were washed thoroughly
with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were
eluted using 2× SDS loading buffer and then boiled at
95°C for 4 mins. Denatured proteins were subsequently
separated on 10% SDS PAGE and immunoblotted against
anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies as required after
transferring to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes as
previously described [65]. The experiments were repeated
on at least three separate occasions.

Measuring the level of fluorescence using ImageJ
For quantification of fluorescence intensity, images
of IFs were converted into binary images using the ImageJ
program (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html) for
determining/measuring the level of fluorescence in a
selected area. We selected the area of the image with Redfluorescent (stained with phospho-p53 antibody) first while
set measurements for area, integrated density and mean.
Basically with selecting “measure” it provide values. Once
measurement for red-fluorescent finished, DAPI (bluefluorescent) were selected. We have also selected area
with no fluorescent as background. We have selected 5
areas per slide. We used the following formula to calculate
the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF). CTCF =
Integrated Density – (Area of selected fluorescent ×
Mean fluorescence of background readings). Then, we
have calculated the ratio of average values obtained
between p53(Ser15)/DAPI (red/blue) for each condition.
We made a graph and showed % of their relative of
fluorescence.

Cytotoxicity/viability and colony forming
efficiency assays
Induction of cellular-proliferation through
FBXW7-depletion may provide drug-treated cells with
survival advantages; therefore prior to treatments,
CRC-cells synchronized in G0-phase by serum-free
starvation for 18 hrs, and then followed 72 hrs with
oxaliplatin treatment (Tocris). To determine the celldensity Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) (Sigma) colorimetric
assay was performed. In order to fix the cells, 50 μl
of 30%(w/v) cold Trichloroacetic-acid (TCA) added
per well and incubated with a final concentration of
10%-TCA for 60 mins at 4°C. After discarding the
solution, the plate washed with distilled water and air
dried. Then, the fixed cells dyed with 0.4%(w/v) SRB,
in 1%-acetic-acid for  20 mins at RT. Following fivewashings with 1%-acetic-acid and air-drying, the SRB
was dissolved by adding 200 μl of 10 mM-Trizmabase. Lastly, a microplate-reader (Bio-Rad) measured
the absorbance at 540 nm-wavelength [66]. Data were
elaborated using Microsoft-Office Excel and GraphPadPrism softwares (http://www.graphpad.com/scientificsoftware/prism/). Colony forming efficiency assay of
HCT116(FBXW7+/+), HCT116(FBXW7−/−) cells
treated with 2 different concentrations of oxaliplatin
for 72 hours for 200 of seeded cells. Images were taken
following colonies fixation and crystal violet staining on
day 14 of growth and colonies were counted.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was undertaken using SPSS 15.0
software. All evaluations were done using the unpaired
two-tailed Student’s t-test. For IHC analysis, the chisquare test was used and p < 0.05 was considered to
indicate a significant difference.
