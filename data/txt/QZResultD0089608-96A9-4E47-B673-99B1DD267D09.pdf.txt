Abstract
Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides expressing CpG motifs (CpG-ODN) are a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist
that can enhance the antitumor activity of DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiation therapy in preclinical
mouse models. We hypothesized that the success of these combinations is related to the ability of CpG-ODN to
modulate genes involved in DNA repair. We conducted an in silico analysis of genes implicated in DNA repair in
data sets obtained from murine colon carcinoma cells in mice injected intratumorally with CpG-ODN and from
splenocytes in mice treated intraperitoneally with CpG-ODN. CpG-ODN treatment caused downregulation of
DNA repair genes in tumors. Microarray analyses of human IGROV-1 ovarian carcinoma xenografts in mice
treated intraperitoneally with CpG-ODN confirmed in silico findings. When combined with the DNA-damaging
drug cisplatin, CpG-ODN significantly increased the life span of mice compared with individual treatments. In
contrast, CpG-ODN led to an upregulation of genes involved in DNA repair in immune cells. Cisplatin-treated
patients with ovarian carcinoma as well as anthracycline-treated patients with breast cancer who are classified
as "CpG-like" for the level of expression of CpG-ODN modulated DNA repair genes have a better outcome than
patients classified as "CpG-untreated-like," indicating the relevance of these genes in the tumor cell response to
DNA-damaging drugs. Taken together, the findings provide evidence that the tumor microenvironment can
sensitize cancer cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapy, thereby expanding the benefits of CpG-ODN therapy
beyond induction of a strong immune response. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6382–90. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The mammalian innate immune system identifies the presence of infection through recognition of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns expressed by a diverse group of infectious
microorganisms. Various pattern recognition receptors are
involved in pathogen-associated molecular pattern identification, among which the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family of at
least 10 different members in humans (1, 2) is probably the
best known. These receptors are considered sensors for
microbial infections or other danger signals and, together
with other molecular sensors, serve as a first line of defense,

inducing soluble and cellular mediators of innate immunity
and initiating key steps of the adaptive immune response (3).
Particular clinical interest now revolves around TLR9, which is
expressed not only on cells of the immune system but also on
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells (3–6) and
which recognizes bacterial and viral DNA with unmethylated
CpG motifs. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) expressing CpG motifs mimic the immunostimulatory activity of
bacterial DNA and are commonly used to activate TLR9 for
therapeutic applications (3). CpG-ODN has shown antitumor
activity in different animal models (7, 8) and in patients with
malignant melanoma, renal carcinoma, and recurrent or
refractory lymphoma (9–12); however, experimental studies
suggest that CpG-ODN may be more useful as a component of
multiagent therapy for cancer rather than as a single agent
(13). Because chemotherapy is known to be immunosuppressive, it may seem counterintuitive to combine it with TLR9
stimulation. Nevertheless, different chemotherapeutic drugs
have been reported to improve the efficacy of CpG-ODN in
mouse tumor models (14, 15). In immunocompetent mice,
paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide enhanced CpG-ODN effects
by depleting regulatory T cells, increasing the immunogenicity
of tumor cells, and changing T-cell homeostasis; moreover,
the presence of CD8þ T cells was found to be required (16).
In immunocompromised athymic mice, the mechanisms

DNA Repair Gene Modulation in Tumors by CpG-ODN

underlying the improved antitumor effect when CpG-ODN
was combined with gimatecan (17), gemcitabine (6), or topotecan (18, 19) have to be different from those in immunocompetent mice and remain unclear. It is noteworthy that,
although these 3 chemotherapeutic agents differ in mechanisms of action, their cytotoxic activity is generally the consequence of DNA damage. Even ionizing radiotherapy (RT),
generally administered locally to the tumor site or draining
lymph nodes, kills cancer by damaging DNA, and experiments
in murine models suggest that CpG-ODN can enhance the
response to RT in both immunogenic (20, 21) and nonimmunogenic tumors (22). For nonimmunogenic tumors, the mechanism remains undefined, as the rationale for even exploring
the combination of CpG-ODN with radiation, that is, that
dendritic cells acquire antigens released from tumor cells after
RT and migrate to regional lymph nodes where they encounter
and activate tumor-specific cytotoxic cells, does not apply.
Unlike observations in tumor cells where CpG-ODN seems
to increase the activity of RT, studies on the combination
of RT and CpG-ODN in mice have shown that TLR9 engagement on CD4þ T lymphocytes reduces apoptosis and enhances their capacity to repair DNA damage induced by
g-radiation (23).
On the basis of these disparate observations, we hypothesized that CpG-ODN modulates genes involved in DNA repair,
increasing their expression in TLR9-expressing immune cells
but downregulating their expression in tumor cells and thereby increasing sensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic
agents. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of CpGODN treatment on DNA repair gene expression in immune
and tumor cells in silico and in our previously described model
of IGROV-1 ovarian tumor–bearing athymic mice (24) and
assessed the antitumor effect of CpG-ODN associated with
DNA-damaging chemotherapy in this mouse model.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The IGROV-1 tumor (gift from Dr. J. Benard, Institute
Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France) and OVCAR-5 (American
Type Culture Collection) were adapted to grow intraperitoneally (i.p.) and maintained by serial intraperitoneal passage
of ascitic cells into healthy mice as previously described (25).
Every 6 months, cells were authenticated by morphologic
inspection and by the presence of specific markers with
fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. For in vitro experiments, cells were maintained in RPMI-1649 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and 2 mmol/L
glutamine (Cambrex) at 37 C in a 5% CO2 air atmosphere.
In vitro and in vivo experiments for microarray analyses
For microarray experiments, mice were injected i.p. with
2.5  106 ascitic cells in 0.2 mL of saline and treated, starting
11 to 12 days later, when mice showed evident and established
ascites, with CpG-ODN delivered i.p. at a dose of 20 mg per
mouse daily for 3 days. Control mice received saline. Ascitesbearing mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 24 hours
after the last treatment with saline or CpG-ODN. Tumors

www.aacrjournals.org

adherent to omentum were removed and immediately frozen
in liquid nitrogen until RNA or protein extraction.
For microarray experiments, to evaluate a direct action of
CpG-ODN on tumor cells, 1  106 IGROV-1 cells were seeded
in 6-well plates and treated with 10 mmol/L of CpG-ODN in
complete culture medium for 24 hours. At the end of treatment, cells were collected and RNA was extracted.
To define whether local treatment at the tumor site is
critical to downregulate DNA repair genes, mice were
injected i.p. with IGROV-1 tumor cells as described earlier
and treated i.p. or s.c. with CpG-ODN at a dose of 20 mg per
mouse daily for 3 days. Twenty-four hours after the last
treatment with saline or CpG-ODN, ascites-bearing mice
were sacrificed and tumors adherent to the peritoneal wall
were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
until RNA extraction.

Results
DNA repair gene modulation in immune and
nonimmune normal cells by CpG-ODN
To evaluate the effect of CpG-ODN on DNA repair genes in
immune cells, we conducted a comprehensive in silico expression analysis of genes implicated in DNA repair
(GSE11202) in immune spleen cells from mice treated i.p.
with CpG-ODN (26). Spleen cells were chosen for this analysis
on the basis of previous studies establishing that the spleen
accurately reflects the breadth of immunity induced by CpGODN in vivo (27–32). Expression levels of mRNA in mouse
spleen cells were monitored by microarray at different times
after in vivo CpG-ODN treatment. From a list of 209 genes
retrieved according to the "DNA repair" term from Gene
Ontology (GO:0006281 mouse), 189 were present in the
GSE11202 and 49 genes were found to be significantly modulated [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05] during the course of
CpG-ODN treatment, 43 of which were upregulated (Fig. 1).
Accordingly, analysis of a published gene expression data set
(E-TABM-823) in immune mucosal lung tissue of mice 48
hours after intranasal administration of CpG-ODN, when
CpG-ODN-induced recruitment of natural killer and dendritic
cell into the bronchoalveolar spaces peaked (33), identified 29
genes in the DNA repair pathway that were significantly
modulated by CpG-ODN treatment (FDR < 0.05), 21 of which
were upregulated (Supplementary Fig. S1). It is noteworthy
that 13 of 29 modulated genes were shared with those
modulated in immune spleen cells. Thus, the presence of
microbial DNA seems to induce upregulation of genes involved in DNA repair in immune cells.
To test whether CpG-ODN similarly affects nonimmune
TLR9-negative normal cells, we conducted expression analysis
of DNA repair genes using a whole-mouse genome microarray
data set (E-TABM-506), obtained from murine quadriceps
muscle injected with CpG-ODN in experiments to evaluate
this biodrug as a vaccine adjuvant (34); only 2 genes, NBR and
FAM175, for which the specific function of the encoded
proteins is unknown, were modulated (FDR < 0.05; data
not shown). Thus, CpG-ODN does not induce significant
modulation of DNA repair genes in nonimmune normal cells.

genes involved in the DNA repair pathway (GO:0006281 mouse), 189 were present in the GSE11202 data set and 49 of these genes showed significant

DNA repair gene modulation in tumor cells by

The potential effect of CpG-ODN in tumor cells was evaluated on the basis of the expression of the corresponding

murine colon carcinoma cells in mice injected intratumorally
with CpG-ODN (GSE18203; ref. 35). CpG-ODN treatment was
found to modulate DNA repair gene expression in tumors, and
50 genes were modulated at a threshold of P < 0.05. However,

unlike observations in immune cells, CpG-ODN treatment
induced mainly a downregulation of DNA repair genes in
tumor cells (40 of 50 modulated genes were downregulated;
Fig. 2A and B). These findings were experimentally proofed by
microarray analyses of human IGROV-1 ovarian carcinoma
xenografts in mice treated daily i.p. with CpG-ODN or saline
beginning 3 days after evidence of ascites. Twenty-four hours
after the final treatment, tumors adhering to omentum were

analyzed for gene expression profile. Among the 232 genes
belonging to GO:0006281 human, 227 genes available in our
microarray platform clustered tumors according to saline or
CpG-ODN treatment (GSE23441; Fig. 3A), and the pattern of
this gene modulation in CpG-ODN–treated mice reflected an
increased susceptibility to DNA damage (75 of 114 genes
modulated at a threshold of P < 0.05 were downregulated;
Fig. 3B). The power of CpG-ODN in modulating cancer cell
DNA repair genes was confirmed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), as IPA of 1,765 up- or downmodulated genes by
CpG-ODN compared with controls revealed that the cell
death, embryonic development, DNA replication, recombination, and repair pathway were the most influenced (Supplementary Fig. S2). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of
RAD51C, SIRT1, RAD54B, and RAD23B genes validated microarray data (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Results of microarray analyses were also validated by
examining the expression of the gene products RAD51 and
SIRT1 in tumors from CpG-ODN–treated and control mice.
Western blot analysis of tumor cell lysates indicated decreased
expression of RAD51 and SIRT1 proteins in treated mice as
compared with controls (Fig. 4A and B). Thus, microarray
analyses indicate that locally administered TLR9 agonists
regulate genes involved in DNA repair in tumor cells in the
opposite way from immune cells.
Expression of CpG-ODN–modulated DNA repair genes
and survival in ovarian and breast cancer patients
treated with DNA-damaging therapy
To evaluate whether CpG-ODN-induced DNA repair gene
modulations, observed in IGROV-1 microarray analysis, were
relevant to increase the cell sensitivity to DNA damages,
among the genes found differentially modulated between
the CpG-ODN–treated and untreated IGROV-1 tumors, a
set of 27 genes with a level of FDR less than 0.01 and a fold
difference of more than 1.5 was selected (Supplementary
Fig. S4) and the average expression of both CpG-ODN–treated
and untreated tumors was calculated for each gene; the
resulting expression pattern was used to analyze an ovarian
microarray data set containing the gene expression data of
ovarian cancer samples obtained at initial cytoreductive surgery from patients who then received platinum-based primary
chemotherapy (36). The Pearson correlation coefficient between expression values of the 27 genes and those available in

protein loading per lane.

the ovarian data set was calculated for both the CpG-ODN–
treated and untreated conditions; the difference was tested for
its association with clinical outcome in Kaplan–Meier survival
analysis, with patients grouped depending on correlation
values. Two groups were identified as CpG-ODN–treated-like
cases (named "CpG-like") and CpG-ODN–untreated-like cases
(named "CpG-untreated-like"). Analysis of the data set for
available clinical data revealed no association of CpG-like
feature with grade and debulking (Supplementary Table S1A).
As shown in Fig. 5A, patients of the CpG-like group showed
a significantly increased overall survival compared with the
CpG-untreated-like group. Cox proportional hazard analysis
confirmed above-mentioned results [HR ¼ 0.5949; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3663–0.9661; P ¼ 0.0367]. Multivariate
Cox proportional model indicated that CpG-like signature
resulted in independent association with overall survival
(HR ¼ 0.5749; 95% CI, 0.346–0.9553; P ¼ 0.0335; Supplementary
Table S1B). A cross-validation procedure removing each single
gene from the gene set and the Cox analysis on the remaining
gene set revealed that the prediction performance is not
related to a particular gene, as in all analyses a value of
P < 0.05 was observed (Supplementary Fig. S5), even though
RAD23B is the gene that mainly influences the significance of
statistical analysis.
To test the relevance of RAD23B in the sensitivity to DNAdamaging agents in IGROV-1 cell line, we downregulated
RAD23B protein levels by specific siRNA transfection (Supplementary Fig. S6A). In vitro cisplatin cytotoxicity was significantly reduced (P < 0.0001) by downregulation of RAD23B
(Supplementary Fig. S6B).
When Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was conducted on a
breast cancer data set of whole-genome expression of patients
who received adjuvant DNA–damaging chemotherapy after
surgery (37), patients classified as CpG-like showed a significantly increased relapse-free and overall survival compared
with CpG-untreated-like patients (Fig. 5B); on the contrary, no
outcome difference was observed in the cohort of patients not
treated with DNA-damaging adjuvant therapy (Fig. 5C).

6386

Cancer Res; 71(20) October 15, 2011

In chemotherapy-treated patients, CpG-like signature was
significantly associated with grade (1 þ 2; P ¼ 0.0048), whereas
no association was found with the other pathologic parameters (estrogen receptor, tumor size, and node status; Supplementary Table S2A). Multivariate analysis of all covariates
(i.e., estrogen receptor, tumor size, grade, node status, and
CpG-like signature) indicated that CpG-like signature resulted
in an independent strong prognostic factor (HR ¼ 0.3875; 95%
CI, 0.1812–0.8287; P ¼ 0,015) of relapse-free survival (Supplementary Table S2B).
Together, these findings indicate that CpG-ODN modulate
DNA repair gene expression that are relevant for cell sensitivity to DNA damages.
Antitumor effect of CpG-ODN and cisplatin in human
ovarian tumor xenografts
To test for a correlation between DNA repair gene downmodulation and sensitivity to DNA-damage–inducing drugs,
we evaluated the effect of CpG-ODN treatment on the
antitumor activity of cisplatin, a DNA cross-linking agent
(38). IGROV-1 ovarian tumor–bearing athymic mice were
used in these experiments, as IGROV-1 cells are sensitive
to cisplatin (39) and as CpG-ODN in this model has been
shown to prolong survival of mice with bulky disease inducing an activation of different effector cells and cytokines
of innate immunity at the site of tumor growth (8, 24). Mice
were treated i.p. with CpG-ODN, cisplatin, or both 8 days
after tumor cell injection, when ascites start to form. Analysis of the effect of the combined treatment revealed a
significant (P < 0.0001) increase in life span compared with
the use of either reagent alone [treated/control (T/C) values:
200% for cisplatin, 305% for CpG-ODN, and 460% for cisplatin plus CpG-ODN; Fig. 6].
The antitumor efficacy of CpG-ODN in combination with
cisplatin was also assayed in mice bearing the human ovarian
tumor cells OVCAR-5. As previously observed in IGROV-1
mouse model, mice bearing OVCAR-5 human ovarian cell line
and treated with CpG-ODN plus cisplatin survived significantly
longer than those treated with CpG-ODN or cisplatin alone
(T/C values: 118% for cisplatin, 188% for CpG-ODN, and 267%
for cisplatin plus CpG-ODN; Supplementary Fig. S7)
It should be noted that the modulation of DNA repair genes
in human ovarian IGROV-1 tumors and the increase in the
antitumor effect of cisplatin and CpG-ODN against IGROV-1
human ovarian tumor xenografts in mice were observed in
mice injected with a CpG-ODN sequence specific for murine
TLR9, making unlikely the possibility that the modulation was
related to a direct interaction of CpG-ODN with tumor cells, as
different DNA motifs are required for stimulation of mouse and
human cells by CpG-ODN (40, 41). Nevertheless, we carried out
a microarray analysis on mRNA extracted from IGROV-1 cells
stimulated in vitro with murine CpG-ODN (GSE23442); none
of 16,824 analyzed genes were found to be significantly
modulated by CpG-ODN (no genes with FDR < 0.1) compared
with IGROV-1 cells cultured in medium alone (data not shown),
excluding a direct action of CpG-ODN on tumor cells.
Our evidence of downmodulation in DNA repair genes in
tumor cells in the analyses thus far involved the administra-

tion of CpG-ODN at or near the tumor site. Indeed, microarray
analyses of mRNA from IGROV-1 tumors adhering to the
omentum in mice bearing IGROV-1 ascites and treated subcutaneously daily for 3 days with CpG-ODN revealed no
significantly modulated genes (FDR < 0.1) as compared with
tumors from saline-treated mice (data not shown); thus,
injection of CpG-ODN at the tumor site seems to be critical
for DNA repair gene modulation in tumor cells.
In that case, a relevant role for peritumoral TLR9-expressing
cells, such as innate immune cells, and/or endothelial cells,
fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, in this modulation is plausible.
These cells might induce downregulation of DNA repair genes
in tumor cells through a direct cell–cell interaction and/or by
secreting soluble factors.
To evaluate the involvement of soluble molecule(s) in DNA
repair gene modulation, cell-free ascitic fluid supernatants,

RAD23B, RAD51C, SIRT1, and RAD54B were determined by
qRT-PCR. Incubation with ascitic fluids from CpG-ODN–treated mice induced a downmodulation of RAD51C (P ¼ 0.0443),
SIRT1 (P ¼ 0.0374), and RAD54B (P ¼ 0.00851) levels, consistent
with microarray results, and a trend toward a higher median

was upmodulated in microarray experiments.
Moreover, preincubation of IGROV-1 cells with ascitic fluids
from CpG-ODN–treated mice for 48 hours enhanced cisplatin

TLR9 activation or occurs after activation with the only other
TLR agonist currently used in oncologic therapy, imiquimod—
an immunomodulator that functions as agonist of TLR7
and/or TLR8 (42)—a comprehensive in silico expression analysis of genes implicated in DNA repair (GO:0006281 mouse) on
mRNA extracted from spontaneous s.c. tumors from mice
treated topically with imiquimod (GSE20032; ref. 43) was
conducted. Imiquimod treatment was found to modulate
DNA repair gene expression in tumors, which clustered
according to treatment (treated vs. control; Supplementary
Fig. S9A), and the pattern of gene modulation in imiquimodtreated mice reflected an increased susceptibility to DNA
damage (29 of 32 genes modulated at a threshold of P <
0.05 were downregulated; Supplementary Fig. S9B).

Discussion
In the present study, we show by microarray analyses that
TLR9 ligand CpG-ODN treatment induces downmodulation of
DNA repair genes in tumor cells of both murine and human
origins. Expression-level analysis of proteins, RAD51, a key
protein in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway (44), and SIRT1, whose activity promotes homologous
recombination (45), in human tumor cells confirmed microarray results. These proteins are involved in homologous
recombination and, consequently, are relevant for the repair
of interstrand cross-links, which are the most cytotoxic lesions
induced by cisplatin. Accordingly, the combination of cisplatin
and CpG-ODN against IGROV-1 human ovarian tumor xenografts in athymic mice was found to induce a remarkable
increase in life span compared with that using either reagent
alone (P < 0.0001).

The combined data from our analysis and in silico analyses
revealed modulation of DNA repair genes in both murine
colon carcinoma MC38 cells and human ovarian carcinoma
IGROV-1 cells, suggesting that this effect is not restricted to a
specific cancer cell histotype. The observation that this modulation also occurs after treatment with an agonist of TLR7
and/or TLR8 might suggest that this event can be shared by
the functional subgroup of TLRs, consisting of TLR7, TLR8,
and TLR9, which reside intracellularly and recognize nucleic
acids derived from the genome of viruses and bacteria (42).
The findings that intratumoral delivery of CpG-ODN was
critical in inducing DNA repair protein downmodulation in
tumors and that CpG-ODN did not interact directly with the
tumor cells to induce this downmodulation in IGROV-1
ovarian cancer cells point to the importance of the activation
of the TLR9-positive cells (innate immune cells, endothelial
cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells) present in the tumor
microenvironment, in modulating DNA repair gene expression. Moreover, our data suggest that soluble molecules in
ascitic fluid, presumably released by the above-mentioned
TLR9-positive cells, are involved in the modulation of DNA
repair genes. The lower modulation of DNA repair genes
observed in ex vivo experiments compared with that in in
vivo might depend on the loss of activity of some factors or on
the need for both soluble factors and contact between CpGODN–activated cells and tumor cells.
Clinical results from association of CpG-ODN with DNAdamaging drugs in lung tumor patients have so far been
disappointing in improving clinical outcome (46).
On the basis of our findings, this absence of CpG-induced
enhanced chemosensitivity of tumor cells to DNA-damage–
inducing agents may rest in the s.c. administration of CpGODN, distant from the tumor cells.
On the contrary, we observed by in silico analyses that TLR9
ligand CpG-ODN treatment induces essentially an upmodulation of DNA repair genes in immune cells. Moreover, it is
noteworthy that 19 of 49 genes modulated in spleen cells after
CpG-ODN treatment and even did so in IGROV-1 tumor cells,
but for most of them the modulation was in an opposite way
(14 genes upregulated in spleen were downregulated in tumor,
and 3 genes downregulated in spleen were upregulated in
tumor).
Despite numerous previous microarray analyses of immune
cells after in vitro or in vivo stimulation with CpG-ODN (26, 33,
35, 43, 47), to our knowledge, an upregulation of DNA repair
genes after CpG-ODN treatment has not been reported. This
might reflect a primary focus in previous studies on signaling
pathways that induce expression of immune and proinflammatory genes (48), in light of the function of TLRs as innate
immunity sensors of microbial products.
CpG-ODN–induced downmodulation of DNA repair genes
in tumor cells and upmodulation in immune cells might
represent a physiologic phenomenon that occurs locally in
the presence of an infectious event. Thus, upon detecting the
presence of an infectious agent via endosomal TLRs, immune
cells might regulate DNA repair genes to decrease their
susceptibility to possible proapoptotic signals during infections and, at the same time, directly and/or indirectly induce

DNA Repair Gene Modulation in Tumors by CpG-ODN

modulation of DNA repair genes in infected (or transformed)
cells to facilitate their death. Insignificant modulations of
these genes observed in normal muscle cells suggest that
CpG-ODN–activated immune cells induce downmodulation
of DNA repair genes only in "altered" cells expressing apposite
receptors. Moreover, better outcome of cisplatin-treated ovarian carcinoma patients, as well as of anthracycline-treated
breast cancer patients, classified as CpG-like, compared with
patients classified as CpG-untreated-like, indicates the relevance of these genes in the tumor cell response to DNAdamaging drugs. In subjects who did not receive adjuvant
chemotherapy, expression of CpG-ODN–modulated DNA repair genes was not associated with significantly better outcome, indicating that these genes are not prognostic of
survival.
Together, our present data provide the first evidence that
TLR9-expressing cells present in the tumor microenvironment can sensitize cancer cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapy, underscoring the need for further investigation of

the synergistic effect of CpG-ODN in combination with DNAdamaging drugs in cancer treatment.
