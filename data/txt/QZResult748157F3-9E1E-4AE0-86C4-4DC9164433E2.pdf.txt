Summary
We conducted a large-scale functional genetic study to characterize mechanisms of resistance to
ALK inhibition in ALK-dependent lung cancer cells. We identify members of known resistance
pathways and additional putative resistance drivers. Among the latter were members of the P2Y
purinergic receptor family of G-protein coupled receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y6). P2Y
receptors mediated resistance in part through a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent mechanism.
Moreover, PKC activation alone was sufficient to confer resistance to ALK inhibitors whereas
combined ALK and PKC inhibition restored sensitivity. We observed enrichment of gene
signatures associated with several resistance drivers (including P2Y receptors) in crizotinib-

resistant ALK-rearranged lung tumors compared to treatment-naïve controls, supporting a role for
identified resistance mechanisms in clinical resistance.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

An understanding of the mechanisms by which tumors harbor primary drug resistance or
acquire resistance to targeted therapies is critical for precisely predicting which patients will
respond to a specific therapy and for the identification of additional targetable pathways to
maximize clinical benefit (Garraway and Janne, 2012). The EML4-ALK fusion protein is an
oncogenic driver in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Soda et al., 2007). A
chromosomal inversion gives rise to EML4-ALK, leading to ectopic expression of
constitutively-active ALK tyrosine kinase. Aberrant ALK activity in turn up-regulates
effectors of cell survival and proliferation, including the MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways
(Shaw et al., 2013).

Author Manuscript

Crizotinib is an oral MET/ALK inhibitor used as first-line therapy in the treatment of
advanced NSCLC harboring ALK rearrangements. In addition, newer second-generation
ALK inhibitors with increased potency and selectivity against ALK are under evaluation in
clinical trials. Like crizotinib, these agents are ATP-competitive inhibitors of the ALK
tyrosine kinase although they are structurally distinct from crizotinib. Ceritinib (also known
as LDK378) is a second-generation inhibitor that has shown remarkable activity in patients
with ALK-positive lung cancer, including individuals with acquired resistance to crizotinib
(Shaw et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2014; Solomon et al., 2014). Ceritinib recently received
FDA approval for use in patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC previously treated
with crizotinib. However, responses to ALK inhibitors are short-lived, with resistance
commonly occurring within a year.

Author Manuscript

Since the introduction of crizotinib in the treatment of ALK-driven NSCLC, gene
amplification or secondary mutations in EML4-ALK have been identified in approximately
one-third of tumors with acquired resistance to crizotinib (Choi et al., 2010; Doebele et al.,
2012; Katayama et al., 2012; Sasaki et al., 2011). Secondary mutations have been shown in
vitro to drive resistance to crizotinib, but not all confer resistance to the structurally-distinct
second-generation ALK inhibitors (Katayama et al., 2011; Katayama et al., 2012). In
addition, activation of EGFR, KIT, and IGF-1R have been separately identified in a subset
of tumors with resistance to crizotinib (Katayama et al., 2012; Lovly et al., 2014; Sasaki et
al., 2011). Resistance to second-generation ALK inhibitors is less characterized due to the
recent introduction of these agents to the clinic, although secondary mutations in EML4-ALK
have been identified in a subset of tumors with acquired ceritinib resistance (Friboulet et al.,
2014). Importantly, no mechanism of resistance to crizotinib or ceritinib has been identified
in up to half of all tumors reported to date (Doebele et al., 2012; Friboulet et al., 2014;
Katayama et al., 2012). This observation motivates a broad search for additional resistance
mediators that may provide opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches. We performed a
large-scale functional genetic study to identify genes whose overexpression is sufficient to
confer resistance to ALK inhibition.

Results
A large-scale functional study to identify candidate drivers of resistance to ALK inhibition

Author Manuscript

We aimed to identify gain-of-function mediators of resistance to ALK inhibition by
systematic perturbation of gene expression. The Center for Cancer Systems Biology
(CCSB)-Broad lentiviral expression library is a publicly-available large-scale open reading
frame (ORF) library consisting of 15,885 ORFs representing 12,800 human genes (Yang et
al., 2011). To identify transcripts sufficient to drive resistance to ALK inhibition, we
individually introduced each ORF into an ALK-dependent lung adenocarcinoma cell line
(H3122) with marked sensitivity to ALK inhibitors. ORF-expressing cells were assayed for
sensitivity both to crizotinib and to the second-generation ALK inhibitor, TAE684 (Figure
1A). A mutant form (L1152R) of EML4-ALK known to confer resistance to both crizotinib
and second-generation ALK inhibitors was used as a positive control (Figure 1B) (Sasaki et
al., 2011). See Experimental Procedures for a full description of the experimental design.

Author Manuscript

Statistical analysis of correlation among screening replicates and estimation of lentiviral
infection efficiency were performed as quality-control measures (Figure S1). 95% of
assayed ORFs met quality-control thresholds and were evaluated for effects on sensitivity to
ALK inhibition (see Experimental Procedures). Most ORF-expressing cells remained
sensitive to crizotinib and TAE684 (Figure 1C). For H3122 cells expressing each individual
ORF in the library, the differential proliferation in drug was expressed as the ratio of cell
viability in the presence of drug divided by cell viability in the absence of drug. Differential
proliferation for each ORF in crizotinib and TAE684 was then expressed as a z-score (%
viability z-score) to normalize across the entire dataset acquired during the screen (see
Experimental Procedures). ORFs conferring a differential proliferation in the presence of
crizotinib or TAE684 ≥3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean (% viability z-score score
≥3) were selected as candidate mediators of resistance to ALK inhibition. A total of 75
ORFs representing 67 genes met this criterion, with 43 ORFs yielding a % viability z-score
≥3 for both drugs (Figure 1D, 2A).
Validation and characterization of candidate drivers of resistance to ALK inhibition in
H3122

Author Manuscript

We next performed a validation study in which the 75 candidate ORFs were subjected to 7point growth inhibition assays in H3122 with crizotinib and TAE684. The area under the
curve (AUC) was determined for each ORF. ORFs associated with an AUC ≥2.5 SD above
the mean for either drug (determined in parallel from a cohort of control ORFs) were
considered validated resistance drivers in H3122. Overall, 61 ORFs representing 54 genes
met this criterion (81% of candidate resistance ORFs identified from the initial screening
study; Figure 2A).
Validated resistance genes reflect diverse protein classes (Figure 2B). Prominent among
these are transcription factors, serine-threonine and tyrosine kinases, growth factors, and
signal transduction adapter proteins. Resistance profiles of the 54 validated resistance genes
against crizotinib and TAE684 in H3122 are shown in Figure 2C. Of note, we confirmed

that validated genes also drive resistance to the second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib
with results comparable to TAE684 (Figure S2).

Author Manuscript

A subset of the identified ALK resistance genes overlap with resistance drivers to MAP
kinase pathway inhibition identified in BRAF-mutant melanoma (Johannessen et al., 2010;
Johannessen et al., 2013). Among these are kinases (such as AXL, MAP3K8, and RAF1),
adapter proteins (including CRKL and GAB1), and transcription factors (such as ETV1,
FOS, and YAP1). This finding is not surprising given the central role of MEK/ERK
signaling in both contexts. However there are noteworthy differences between the datasets.
For example, growth factors are more prevalent in the present study and include five EGFrelated peptides (Figure S2). This is consistent with prior reports suggesting a role for EGF
ligands and EGFR activation in resistance to ALK inhibition (Katayama et al., 2012; Sasaki
et al., 2011; Tanimoto et al., 2014; Tanizaki et al., 2012; Voena et al., 2013; Yamada et al.,
2012). More generally, these results corroborate reports implicating paracrine and autocrine
mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies (Harbinski et al., 2012; Straussman et al.,
2012; Wilson et al., 2012).
We compared resistance profiles for crizotinib and TAE684 and identified three ORFs
(AXL, MST1R, and HGF) that validated strongly as drivers of resistance to TAE684 (%
viability z-score >5.5) but not crizotinib (% viability z-score <1; Figure 2D). This
discordance likely reflects the pharmacologic activity of crizotinib against AXL, MST1R,
and MET (the kinase activated by HGF) (Peters and Adjei, 2012). Similar findings for HGFmediated resistance to ALK inhibition have been reported (Tanimoto et al., 2014; Yamada et
al., 2012).
Effects of resistance ORFs on reactivation of MEK/ERK and/or PI3K pathways in H3122

Author Manuscript

Since oncogenic ALK dysregulation activates the MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways (which
promote cell proliferation and survival), we next determined whether ectopically expressed
resistance ORFs might confer resistance by reactivation of ERK and/or AKT in H3122 in
the presence of TAE684. Approximately half of the resistance ORFs (including a subset of
growth factors, kinases, and adapter proteins) produced sustained ERK and/or AKT
activation despite ALK inhibition, underscoring the importance of these pathways in
mediating ALK-driven tumorigenesis (Figure 3). The remaining resistance ORFs had
minimal effect on these pathways, raising the possibility of resistance modules that bypass
these effectors.
Assessment of validated ORFs in resistance to targeted therapies in other NSCLC cell
systems

Author Manuscript

To identify resistance mechanisms more broadly operant in ALK-rearranged lung cancer,
we assayed the 54 validated resistance drivers in MGH006, a second ALK-rearranged
NSCLC cell line (Sequist et al., 2010). Of these, 23 conferred resistance to ALK inhibition
in MGH006, as defined by a differential proliferation in drug ≥2.5 SD above the mean
(determined from control ORFs) with a single dose of crizotinib or TAE684 (Experimental
Procedures; Figure 4). MGH006 is reported to have a secondary dependence on EGFR
activation and demonstrates reduced sensitivity to ALK inhibition compared to H3122

(Figure S3) (Katayama et al., 2012). This observation, coupled with the finding that ectopic
ORF expression was generally lower in MGH006 compared to H3122 (Figure S3), suggests
the resistance effects observed in MGH006 could be an underestimate. Alternatively, our
findings might indicate that certain molecular contexts enable some resistance mechanisms
over others.

Author Manuscript

Several ALK resistance drivers identified in H3122 (including AXL, CRKL, and HGF) have
previously been implicated in resistance to EGFR inhibitors in EGFR-mutant lung cancer
(Cheung et al., 2011; Engelman et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012). In addition, both the
MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways are up-regulated by ALK or EGFR activation in lung cancer.
We hypothesized that a subset of identified mediators of resistance to ALK inhibition in
H3122 might also drive resistance to EGFR inhibition in EGFR-mutant lung cancer. To test
this, we expressed the ALK resistance ORFs in three EGFR-mutant NSCLC lines (HCC827,
HCC4006, and PC-9) and performed inhibition studies with erlotinib (Figure 4, Figure S3).
Most ORFs mediating ALK resistance in H3122 also conferred resistance to erlotinib in
EGFR-mutant lines, with 38 of 54 (70%) validating in at least one such line (Experimental
Procedures). As the activating effects of EGF ligands are presumably blunted by EGFR
inhibition, no EGF ligands identified from the ALK inhibitor screen induced resistance to
erlotinib. Together, these results raise the possibility of shared mechanisms of resistance to
ALK and EGFR inhibition in ALK-rearranged and EGFR-mutant lung cancers, respectively.
We evaluated expression of each resistance ORF in all 5 cell lines assayed in the initial
screening and subsequent validation studies (Figure S3). The majority of assayed ORFs are
expressed in all cell systems, although a subset of ORFs demonstrate differential expression
across cell lines.

Neuregulin-1 as a resistance driver in ALK-dependent lung cancer cell systems

Author Manuscript

The ORF that most strongly induced resistance to ALK inhibition in both H3122 and
MGH006 was neuregulin-1 (NRG1), the ligand that activates HER3. Upon ligand binding,
HER3 forms heterodimers with HER2 to activate downstream signaling pathways. To
confirm the ORF screening and validation findings for NRG1, we treated ALK-dependent
cell lines with recombinant NRG1 peptide and assayed resistance to TAE684 (Figure 5A,
B). Recombinant NRG1 peptide drives resistance to TAE684 in ALK-dependent NSCLC
cell lines (H3122, H2228, and MGH006). NRG1 had no impact on sensitivity to TAE684 in
KELLY cells (an ALK-dependent neuroblastoma cell line), suggesting a context-dependent
role for NRG1 in driving resistance to ALK inhibition. The effect of NRG1 in ALKdependent NSCLC cell lines was abrogated with the combination of TAE684 and lapatinib,
which inhibits the activity of HER2 (the dimerization partner of HER3; Figure 5C, D).
Together, these findings suggest a role for HER2/HER3 activation in resistance to ALK
inhibition. Of note, NRG1 has recently been identified as a putative driver alteration in the
somatic gene fusion CD74-NRG1 in a subset of invasive mucinous lung adenocarcinoma
(Fernandez-Cuesta et al., 2014).

Purinergic P2Y receptors as resistance drivers to ALK inhibition in H3122

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We also examined less-characterized ALK resistance ORFs and associated pathways.
Among these is P2Y2 (encoded by P2RY2), a member of the P2Y subfamily of P2
purinergic receptors. P2Y receptors are membrane-bound G-protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs) activated in response to extracellular nucleotides including ATP. They are widelyexpressed in a variety of tissues including lung epithelia (Schafer et al., 2003). A role has
been postulated for P2Y receptors in mediating the activating effects of ATP in the tumor
microenvironment on tumor growth (Di Virgilio, 2012). However, a role for these proteins
in drug resistance has not previously been demonstrated. There are multiple P2Y family
members which are further subdivided based on coupling to either Gq, Gs, or Gi (BarojaMazo et al., 2013). ORFs encoding ten P2Y family members are included in the CCSBBroad lentiviral expression library. Strikingly, two additional P2Y family members (P2Y1
and P2Y6) scored highly in the initial screening study (% viability z-score 2–3) but did not
meet our threshold for initial follow-up (z-score ≥3; Figure S4).
Given this observation suggesting three P2Y family members capable of impacting
sensitivity to ALK inhibition in H3122, we examined these GPCRs in further detail. H3122
cells expressing these P2Y receptors demonstrated a modest but reproducible decrease in
sensitivity to crizotinib in short-term assays (Figure S4). P2Y-mediated resistance was more
apparent in colony-formation assays, where we observed increased survival of cells
expressing P2Y receptors in crizotinib or ceritinib compared to the Lac Z control (most
notably for P2Y1 and P2Y2; Figure 6A–B).
Resistance associated with P2Y receptors mediated through protein kinase C (PKC)

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We sought to explore the mechanism by which P2Y receptors mediate resistance to ALK
inhibition. Notably, P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y6 each couple to Gq to activate phospholipase C
(Baroja-Mazo et al., 2013). Prior studies suggest that P2Y receptors activate phospholipase
C and protein kinase C (PKC) (Falkenburger et al., 2013). More specifically, P2Y2 has been
shown to activate PKCδ in intestinal cells (Amin et al., 2013). Indeed, we found that H3122
cells overexpressing P2Y1 or P2Y2 (although not P2Y6) had increased levels of activated
PKCδ (Figure 6C). To determine whether PKC activation alone is sufficient to drive
resistance to ALK inhibition, we treated H3122 cells with ceritinib in the presence of the
PKC agonist phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). PMA increased the GI50 of ceritinib
by 10-fold (Figure 6D). PKC activation also conferred resistance to ceritinib in MGH006
(Figure 6D). PMA had no impact on basal cell proliferation in the absence of ceritinib
(Figure 6E). Using activated PKCδ as a marker for PKC activity, we also observed increased
PKCδ activation in populations of H3122 cells cultured to resistance with ceritinib (in
addition to increased EGFR activation as previously reported; Figure 6F; Figure S4;
Experimental Procedures) (Katayama et al., 2012; Sasaki et al., 2011).
Sotrastaurin (AEB071) is a pan-PKC inhibitor in clinical trials (Buder et al., 2013; Chen et
al., 2014). The resistance induced by PMA in H3122 and MGH006 was reversed by
sotrastaurin, consistent with a PKC-dependent phenotype (Figure 6D, G). Furthermore,
H3122 cells ectopically expressing P2Y receptors were sensitive to the combination of
crizotinib and sotrastaurin (Figure 6H). The effect appeared specific for P2Y receptors, as

this combination did not impact resistance conferred by RAF1 (another resistance driver
identified from the study; Figure 6H).
As PKCδ is not included in the CCSB-Broad ORF library, we tested whether overexpression
of PKCδ (encoded by PRKCD) is sufficient to confer resistance to ALK inhibition in H3122.
We observed that overexpression of PKCδ alone is not sufficient to induce resistance to
TAE684 in our assay, suggesting that other PKC isoforms activated by PMA and inhibited
by sotrastaurin may be driving the observed resistance (Figure S4). Of note, the initial
screening study also identified another PKC isoform, PKCε (encoded by PRKCE), as
sufficient to drive resistance to ALK inhibition in H3122 (Figure 2C).
Enrichment of gene signatures associated with resistance drivers in ALK inhibitorresistant tumors compared to treatment-naive controls

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We next asked whether identified resistance drivers and associated pathways might play a
role in clinical resistance to ALK inhibition. We used RNAseq to generate gene expression
profiles from a cohort of ALK-rearranged lung tumors with acquired resistance to crizotinib
and from treatment-naïve ALK-rearranged controls (Table 1). Specimen DFCI76 harbors a
secondary EML4-ALK mutation associated with crizotinib resistance (Sasaki et al., 2011);
all other tumors lacked secondary ALK mutations (and activating EGFR or KRAS
mutations), suggesting alternative resistance mechanisms. We used single-sample Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) to query gene expression signatures for enrichment in
resistant tumors compared to controls (Barbie et al., 2009; Konieczkowski et al., 2014;
Subramanian et al., 2005). A total of 286 oncogenic gene signatures were evaluated,
including 189 from the Molecular Signatures database (Liberzon et al., 2011). These include
signatures associated with activation of a subset of resistance drivers/pathways identified
from our screen, along with a P2Y signature we derived from overexpression of P2Y
receptors in H3122 (Experimental Procedures; Figure 7A).

Author Manuscript

Among the gene signatures enriched in resistant tumors compared to controls (with FDR
≤0.2) were 5 signatures associated with resistance drivers/pathways identified from our
functional study. Two of these were independent EGFR signatures (Creighton et al., 2006;
Gatza et al., 2010; Gatza et al., 2014), consistent with prior reports of an association
between EGFR activation and clinical resistance to ALK inhibition (Figure 7B). We also
observed enrichment of HER2 and RAF1 signatures in resistant tumors, consistent with our
findings of NRG1 (which activates HER2/HER3) and RAF1 as strong drivers of resistance
to ALK inhibition (Figure 4, 5) (Creighton et al., 2006; Gatza et al., 2010; Gatza et al.,
2014). Finally, the P2Y signature we identified in H3122 cells overexpressing P2Y receptors
was also enriched in crizotinib-resistant tumors (Figure 7B, C; Figure S5; Table S1, S2).
These findings suggest activation of transcriptional states associated with EGFR, HER2,
P2Y, and RAF1 in crizotinib-resistant tumors and likely reflect underlying biological
relationships between these pathways. Examination of expanded patient cohorts will be
necessary to confirm these findings. Of note, many genes and pathways identified from our
functional studies as resistance drivers are not represented among gene signatures used for
ssGSEA analysis, limiting a computational assessment of those genes/pathways in resistant
tumors compared to controls.

Given these results, we asked if transcripts encoding EGFR, HER2, RAF1, or P2Y receptors
were increased in resistant tumors. Among these, expression of both P2RY6 and P2RY2 was
significantly increased in crizotinib-resistant tumors compared to treatment-naïve controls
(p=0.021 and 0.033, respectively; Figure 7D, E). This observation provides further support
for activation of a P2Y gene signature in resistant tumors.

Author Manuscript

Expression signatures associated with PKC activation were not represented in the reference
collection of gene signatures used for the ssGSEA analyses described above. Therefore, we
queried tumor expression profiles against the compendium of expression signatures
associated with chemical perturbations in the Connectivity Map (CMap) that included PKC
agonists (Experimental Procedures; Table S3). Among the ALK-rearranged tumors were a
relapsed post-ceritinib (DFCI133) and a pre-ceritinib (DFCI107) specimen obtained from a
single patient who previously experienced disease progression on crizotinib (Table 1).
Among >3200 compounds profiled in CMap, the top 3 chemical signatures most similar to
DFCI133 (compared to DFCI107) were PKC agonists (Table S4). Although limited to a
single patient, this preliminary observation is suggestive of PKC activation in a tumor with
acquired resistance to ceritinib, consistent with our functional data. However, we did not
identify a connection between gene signatures induced by PKC agonists and the entire
cohort of unmatched resistant ALK-rearranged tumors compared to treatment-naïve
controls.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Patients with advanced ALK-rearranged lung cancers are treated with ALK inhibitors
including crizotinib and newer second-generation inhibitors such as ceritinib or alectinib
(Kwak et al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2014). As responses to these agents are generally shortlived, an understanding of the mechanisms leading to drug resistance is essential for the
design of therapeutic strategies to improve efficacy. Here we present findings from a
systematic large-scale functional study of resistance to ALK inhibition in ALK-rearranged
lung cancer. At least 10 of the 54 ORFs identified as potential drivers of resistance to ALK
inhibition represent pathways and proteins previously implicated in clinical resistance to
targeted therapies in lung cancer. These include the EGFR pathway (represented by 5 EGF
ligands identified from our study), MET activation (represented by HGF), SRC-related
kinases (represented by FGR, LCK, and LYN), and the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase
(Crystal et al., 2014; Engelman et al., 2007; Katayama et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012).
These findings underscore the capacity of a functional genomic approach using appropriate
cell line model systems to identify clinically-relevant resistance mechanisms.

Author Manuscript

Our results provide a landscape of genes capable of driving resistance to ALK inhibition and
offer multiple insights about resistance pathways. A subset of the identified resistance
drivers defines a signal transduction network from cell membrane to nucleus, including
growth factors, receptor tyrosine kinases, adapter proteins, serine-threonine kinases, and
transcription factors and DNA/RNA binding proteins. Our findings suggest that increased
expression of individual genes representing multiple nodes of this signal transduction
network is sufficient to drive resistance to ALK inhibition in an ALK-dependent lung cancer
cell system. We demonstrate a subset of these findings is also relevant in the context of

resistance to EGFR inhibitors in EGFR-mutant lung cancer. In particular, a number of
growth factors, kinases, and adapter proteins identified as ALK resistance drivers that reactivate MEK/ERK and/or PI3K signaling in H3122 also drive resistance to EGFR
inhibition in EGFR-mutant lines. This finding highlights the fundamental role of these
pathways in mediating the oncogenic effects of aberrant EGFR and ALK signaling.

Author Manuscript

In total, approximately half of the resistance drivers identified from our study reactivate
MEK/ERK and/or PI3K signaling in H3122. Not all resistance drivers impact these
pathways, however, suggesting alternative bypass mechanisms. Members of the P2Y family
of purinergic receptors and downstream PKC activation represent previously unrecognized
mediators of resistance to ALK inhibition. Overexpression of P2Y receptors did not impact
MEK/ERK or PI3K signaling in our assays (Figure 3A, B; Figure 6C). However, there are
reports suggesting a role for P2Y receptors in EGFR transactivation and MAP kinase
pathway activation in other cell systems (Buvinic et al., 2007; Kehasse et al., 2013; Peterson
et al., 2010; Ratchford et al., 2010; Sham et al., 2013; Tamaishi et al., 2011). The observed
enrichment of gene signatures associated with EGFR, HER2, RAF1, and P2Y in crizotinibresistant tumors may hint at shared resistance-associated transcriptional targets downstream
of these pathways.

Author Manuscript

P2Y receptors mediate resistance at least in part through PKC activation. We demonstrate
that PKC activation alone is sufficient to induce resistance to ALK inhibition and is
overcome with combined ALK and PKC inhibition. A recent study of resistance to the BCRABL inhibitor imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia revealed that up-regulation of PKCη
confers resistance by activation of RAF1 and MEK/ERK signaling (Ma et al., 2014). Further
work will be required to characterize the PKC isoforms driving PKC-mediated resistance in
our study. In addition, larger tumor cohorts will be necessary to determine the prevalence of
P2Y and/or PKC activation in clinical resistance to ALK inhibition.

Author Manuscript

In comparing resistance profiles between crizotinib and second-generation ALK inhibitors
in H3122 cells, we identify HGF (which activates MET), AXL, and MST1R (also known as
RON) as 3 potential mechanisms of resistance to a second-generation ALK inhibitor that do
not impact sensitivity to crizotinib. As noted above, both increased MET and AXL
expression has been implicated in clinical resistance to EGFR inhibitors in EGFR-mutant
lung cancer (Engelman et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012). As crizotinib has activity against
MET, AXL, and MST1R in addition to ALK, our findings suggest that crizotinib may
additionally target at least 3 receptor tyrosine kinases that are potential drivers of resistance
to ALK inhibition in H3122. This observation may have therapeutic implications if first-line
treatment of advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC shifts from crizotinib to more selective
second-generation inhibitors that lack activity against AXL, MST1R, and MET. Conversely,
recent work has shown that the second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib has activity
against IGF-1R (in addition to ALK), which is a potential mechanism of resistance to
crizotinib (Lovly et al., 2014). Thus both crizotinib and second-generation ALK inhibitors
may simultaneously target distinct potential resistance drivers in addition to ALK itself.
Our findings nominate several possible agents (including inhibitors of EGFR, HER2/HER3,
or PKC) that might in principle be combined with ALK inhibition to overcome or delay a

range of resistance mechanisms. However, an emerging theme from this and other
comprehensive resistance studies is that activation of multiple pathways may contribute to
the drug resistance phenotype (Huang et al., 2012; Johannessen et al., 2013). This poses a
significant therapeutic challenge, as it may not be feasible to target all possible resistance
pathways. The potential for “resistance heterogeneity” in the clinical arena may complicate
identification of an optimal treatment strategy for individuals whose tumors acquire
resistance to targeted therapies. Repeat biopsy at disease progression may provide an
opportunity for characterization of resistant tumors to prioritize combinations for individual
patients, but multiple resistance mechanisms within the same tumor could limit therapeutic
efficacy (Gerlinger et al., 2012). Detailed molecular characterization of patient-derived
tumors might determine the frequency at which specific resistance mechanisms occur in
patients, potentially enabling prioritization of high-order therapeutic combinations for
clinical trial design.

In the future, therapeutic disruption of resistance-associated transcriptional states may
provide an alternative to targeting of individual upstream signaling pathways, inasmuch as
such pathways might converge onto shared transcriptional outputs that drive tumor growth
in drug-resistant states. Theoretically, this might be achieved by incorporation of chromatinmodifying agents as part of an ALK-directed treatment strategy. Such an approach that does
not rely solely on inhibition of upstream signaling proteins susceptible to bypass might lead
to more durable responses to targeted therapies.

Experimental Procedures

minutes at 37°C. Cells were infected in 7 replicates. Virus was removed after 24 hours and
replaced with standard growth media (containing 12 ug/mL blasticidin for one replicate).
After an additional 48 hours, the remaining 6 replicates of ORF-expressing cells were
treated with 0.01% DMSO (drug vehicle), 1 µM crizotinib, or 30 nM TAE684 (2 replicates
each). Lentiviral infection, media change, and drug addition were all performed with
robotics. Following 5 days of drug exposure, cell viability was determined using the Cell
Titer-Glo luminescent assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Luminescence was measured with an EnVision Multilabel Reader (Perkin-Elmer).
Screening of the entire CCSB-Broad Lentiviral Expression library (which is arrayed in
forty-seven 384-well plates) was performed in 7 batches. Identification and validation of
candidate resistance ORFs (and associated statistical analyses) are described in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Antibodies and immunoblotting

Author Manuscript

Cells were lysed in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mM
NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 10 mM NaF with protease inhibitors (Roche) and phosphatase
inhibitors (Calbiochem). Lysates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot system (Life
Technologies). Two-color immunoblotting was performed using LI-COR reagents (Odyssey
Blocking Buffer and IRDye 800CW and IRDye 680RD secondary antibodies) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (LI-COR Biosciences). Fluorescence detection was
performed using an Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging System, and quantitation was performed
using Image Studio software (LI-COR). Antibodies against ALK (#3791), AKT (#2920),
phospho-AKT (Ser 473; #4060), EGFR (#2239), phospho-EGFR (Tyr 1068; #3777), PKCδ
(#9616), and phospho-PKCδ (Tyr 311; #2055) were obtained from Cell Signaling. ERK2
antibody (sc-154) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against
phospho-ERK1/ERK2 (Thr 185/Tyr 187; #M8159) and vinculin (#V9131) were obtained
from Sigma. V5 antibody (#R960-25) was obtained from Life Technologies. In-cell Western
blotting is described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Colony-formation assays

Author Manuscript

H3122 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 10–20,000 cells per well. The
following day, cells were spin-infected with lentivirus harboring the indicated ORFs in the
presence of 4 µg/mL polybrene. Virus was removed after 24 hours and replaced with
standard growth media. After an additional 24–48 hours, cells were treated with drug or
DMSO as indicated. Cells were exposed to drug or DMSO for 14–21 days, with media
change and fresh drug addition every 3 days. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and
stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Cells were photographed using a Leica microscope and
imaging software. Quantification of crystal violet uptake for each sample was determined by
de-staining cells with 10% acetic acid and measurement of absorbance at 595 nm using a
SpectraMax 190 instrument (Molecular Devices).
Whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq)
Patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC were identified from the Lowe Center for Thoracic
Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Tumor samples were obtained under an

institutional IRB-approved protocol, and all participating patients provided written informed
consent. Total RNA was extracted from fresh frozen tumor specimens using TRIzol (Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The presence of the EML4-ALK
fusion transcript was confirmed by RT-PCR for each tumor.
We also prepared total RNA from H3122 cells expressing P2Y receptors for RNAseq.
Parental H3122 cells or H3122 expressing ectopic Lac Z, P2Y1, or P2Y2 were exposed to
100 nM TAE684 for 12 hours. (Experimental samples were H3122 cells expressing P2Y1 or
P2Y2; control samples were parental H3122 and H3122 cells expressing Lac Z.) Total RNA
was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase treatment.

Author Manuscript

cDNA libraries were generated for tumor and cell line samples using the TruSeq Sample
Preparation kit (Illumina) with polyA selection according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Revision A 2010). Libraries were pooled using indexed adapters for multiplexing. Pooled
libraries were normalized to 2 nM and denatured using 0.2 N NaOH prior to sequencing.
Flowcell cluster amplification and sequencing were performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocols using either the HiSeq 2000 or HiSeq 2500 to a depth of 45–50
million reads per sample (paired-end with 76 base pair reads).

Author Manuscript

Data was analyzed using the Broad Picard Pipeline which includes de-multiplexing and data
aggregation. Reads were mapped to the reference human genome (hg19) using TopHat
1.4.1. Expression levels for each gene were denoted as RPKM values (reads per kilobase of
transcript per million mapped reads) determined using Cufflinks 2.0.2. Genes that were not
expressed in any patient-derived tumor samples (RPKM=0) were removed from the tumor
dataset; genes not expressed in the cell line samples were removed from the cell line dataset.
Differential transcript expression was determined with the signal-to-noise test statistic with
standard deviation at least 20% of the class mean. A description of the methods used to
analyze RNAseq gene expression data is provided in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.

Significance
ALK inhibitors including crizotinib and ceritinib have transformed the treatment of
advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Unfortunately, responses to these agents are not
durable, motivating efforts to characterize resistance mechanisms that inform future
combinatorial treatment strategies. We assayed over 12,000 genes for the capacity to
drive resistance to ALK inhibition when overexpressed in ALK-dependent lung cancer
cells. Along with known resistance pathways, we identify additional resistance drivers
including several P2Y purinergic receptors acting in part via protein kinase C (PKC).
Collectively, our findings identify a spectrum of mechanisms sufficient to confer
resistance to ALK inhibitors in NSCLC and suggest a role for P2Y receptors and PKC
signaling in resistance to these agents.

A large-scale ORF screen identifies candidate mediators of resistance to ALK inhibition. A.
Overview of the experimental approach. H3122 cells were spin-infected with the CCSBBroad lentiviral expression library. ORF-expressing cells were then treated with crizotinib,
TAE684, DMSO, or blasticidin as indicated. Cell viability was determined after 5 days of
drug exposure using Cell Titer-Glo. B. Growth curves for H3122 cells ectopically
expressing Lac Z, wild-type (WT) EML4-ALK, or L1152R EML4-ALK and exposed to
crizotinib or TAE684 at varying concentrations for 5 days. Mean and standard error of 3
replicates are shown. Results are representative of 3 independent experiments. C. Cell
viability (expressed as raw luminescence values) for all assayed ORFs in the presence or
absence of drug. D. Percent (%) viability z-scores in the presence of crizotinib or TAE684
for each experimental ORF. % viability z-scores are defined as the normalized ratio of cell
viability in drug to cell viability in drug vehicle (DMSO). % viability z-scores for replicates
of the L1152R EML4-ALK positive control are shown in red. Experimental ORFs

A subset of validated resistance ORFs reactivate MEK/ERK or PI3K signaling. Protein
lysates were prepared from ORF-expressing H3122 cells after treatment with 100 nM
TAE684 for 8 hours. Immunoblotting was performed with antibodies against ERK2,
phospho-ERK1/ERK2, AKT, and phospho-AKT. Fluorescence signal intensity for protein
bands was quantitated. A. Ratio of pAKT/AKT immunostaining was determined for each
ORF and normalized to mean pAKT/AKT determined from 13 negative controls (left). Foldincrease in pAKT/AKT relative to controls is shown, with the red horizontal line
representing mean pAKT/AKT from controls. B. As in A, except with pERK/ERK. GPCRs,

associated with a pAKT/AKT or pERK/ERK ratio ≥2.5 standard deviations above the mean
(as determined from the negative controls) were designated as ORFs reactivating AKT or
ERK in the presence of TAE684, respectively. 28 of 54 resistance ORFs (52%) met this
criteria for AKT or ERK; 14 of these 28 ORFs were associated with reactivation of both
AKT and ERK and are indicated in the shaded box.

A subset of resistance ORFs identified in H3122 also drive resistance to targeted therapies in
other lung cancer cell systems. Heat map displaying normalized area under the curve (AUC)
for validated drivers of resistance to crizotinib (CRZ) and TAE684 (TAE) in H3122
compared to negative controls (left) as in Figure 2C. Normalized percent viability for ORFexpressing cells in the indicated doses of CRZ or TAE (for MGH006) or erlotinib (ERL; for
HCC827, HCC4006, and PC-9) are shown. Relative expression of each ectopic experimental
ORF in each cell line is shown in Figure S3. Of note, we were unable to demonstrate ectopic
expression of L1152R EML4-ALK in MGH006 (data not shown), and no effect of this
positive control ORF was therefore observed on resistance to ALK inhibition in MGH006.
