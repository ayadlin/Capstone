Abstract
Cancer chemopreventive activity of sulforaphane has been
predominantly associated with its ability to induce phase II
detoxification enzymes. In the present study, novel targets of
sulforaphane were identified and characterized using a
proteomics approach. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
and mass spectrometry were used to produce protein profiles
of human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells treated with
5 Mmol/L sulforaphane for 48 h and control cells (0.05%
DMSO). Gel comparisons showed the down-regulation to
undetectable level of the serotonin receptor 5-HT3 after
sulforaphane treatment. In addition, Aldo-keto reductase
and D-dopachrome decarboxylase were also differentially
expressed in control and treated cell extracts. To elucidate
two-dimensional gel findings, the neurotransmitter receptors
5-HT3A, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, and the serotonin reuptake transporter were analyzed using Western blotting. Results showed a
decrease of neurotransmitter receptors in a dose-dependent
manner after sulforaphane treatment. Moreover, after exposure of Caco-2 cells to sulforaphane, nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor protein level was increased. These findings suggested
a potential effect of sulforaphane on serotonin release.
Activation of neurotransmitter receptors followed by initiation of cyclic AMP signaling might be crucial events in colon
carcinoma progression. Thus, the effect of sulforaphane may
help to elucidate signaling pathways serotonin-mediated in
colon cancer and lead to development of potential novel
therapeutic agents. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5487–91]

Introduction
Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables,
has been widely studied as a chemopreventive agent (1). The most
studied role of sulforaphane in chemoprevention is its ability to
induce phase II detoxification enzymes. Experimental evidence
suggests that sulforaphane is effective against many carcinogeninduced tumors through induction of phase II detoxification
enzymes. Data from in vivo and in vitro studies showed that
sulforaphane activates NF-E2 p45–related factor-2 transcription
factor in binding antioxidant response elements in the promoter
regions of target genes, thereby increasing cellular defenses against
oxidative stress (2, 3). The anticarcinogenic activities of sulforaphane also include inhibition of phase I enzymes, protection
against heterocyclic amine–induced DNA adduct formation,
induction of apoptosis, and arrest of cell cycle progression (4–6).
Recent studies suggest that sulforaphane suppresses lipopolysacRequests for reprints: Yongping Bao, School of Medicine, Health Policy and

charide-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression through the
modulation of multiple targets in COX-2 gene promoter (7). COX-2
is a key enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis
of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. Accumulating evidence
shows the overexpression of COX-2 in several epithelial carcinomas
including bladder, breast, lung, esophagus, and colon (8, 9).
Pathogenesis of colorectal cancer consists of a series of molecular
and cellular events that become visible with adenomatous polyps
formation (10). The current research is focused on assessing
whether an increase in nutritional intake of sulforaphane may
provide beneficial effects for colon cancer prevention. These levels
are achievable, as data from a human intervention study showed
that 2 hours after consumption of 100 grams standard and highglucosinolate broccoli, plasma concentrations of sulforaphane and
its metabolites reached 2.2 and 7.3 Amol/L, respectively (11). The
purpose of this investigation was to identify and characterize novel
targets of sulforaphane in human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2
cells using relatively low concentrations of sulforaphane (5 Amol/L).
In the present study, the novel effect of sulforaphane as modulator
of neurotransmitter receptors was reported.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cell line was
obtained from the European Collection of Cell Culture. Cell culture
medium and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. Sulforaphane
(4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate; purity, 97%) was purchased from LKT
laboratories (Alexis Biochemicals). Reagents for two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis were obtained from GE Healthcare, Bio-Rad, and Genomic
Solutions (Proteomic Solutions). Antibodies for Western blotting were
purchased from Abcam, Dako, and Santa Cruz. All other chemicals were
purchased from Sigma and Roche Applied Science.
Cell culture and treatments. Cells were grown in DMEM. The cell
culture medium was supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine. Cell growth for proteomics studies
was performed using 10-cm dishes under 5% CO2 in air at 37jC. Cells at
passage 40 to 55 were treated with sulforaphane (5 Amol/L) for 48 h when
they reached 50% of confluence. Sulforaphane was dissolved in DMSO.
Control cells were treated with equal volume of DMSO (0.05%). For Western
blotting studies, cells (2  104 per cm2) were seeded in 6-well plates and
treated with sulforaphane (5, 10, and 20 Amol/L) for 48 h.
Protein extraction. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then
incubated for 30 min in the NP40 buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% Glycerol, and 1% NP40] with addition of one tablet
(in 10 mL buffer) of complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) just
before use. Cells were harvested by scraping and the homogenate was
centrifuged at 13,000 g at 4jC for 15 min. The supernatants were collected
and protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assay (Sigma)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Aliquots of samples were
stored at 80jC.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Protein extracts were desalted
and concentrated to 4 mg/mL using a Biomax 5NMW Membrane Ultrafree
0.5 centrifugal filter (Millipore) at 12,000 g and 4jC before the twodimensional gel procedure. For each sample, two biological and three
technical replicate gels were run.

For Isoelectric focusing (IEF), the samples were prepared by mixing
200 Ag protein with rehydration solution containing 7 mol/L urea, 2 mol/L
thiourea, 2% (w/v) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate hydrate, 18.2 mmol/L DTT, 2% pH 3-11 NL IPG buffer (GE
Healthcare), and a trace of bromophenol blue ( final volume, 440 AL). This
was applied to a 24-cm Immobiline DryStrip pH 3-11 NL (GE Healthcare),
and the strips allowed to rehydrate overnight at 20jC. IEF was then
performed on the IPGphor unit (GE Healthcare) for a total 44,800 V hours at
20jC using the following conditions: Step and Hold at 500 V for 500 V hours,
Gradient to 1,000 V over 800 V hours, Gradient to 8,000 V over 13,500 V
hours, and Step and Hold at 8,000 V for 30,000 V hours. After IEF, the
focused strips were frozen at 70jC until required.
Before the second dimension, the focused strips were conditioned in
filtered (0.45 Am) equilibration buffer, prepared as 5% SDS and 0.01%
bromophenol blue in 0.122 mol/L Tris acetate (Tris Acetate Equilibration
Buffer; Genomic Solutions), modified with 5 mg/mL final volume SDS,
360 mg/mL urea, and 300 mg/mL 99% glycerol. To reduce and alkylate
cysteines, the strips were treated first with 8 mg/mL DTT in the equilibration
buffer (9 mL; 30 min with gentle shaking) before being transferred into
25 mg/mL iodoacetamide in the equilibration buffer (9 mL; 30 min with
gentle shaking). The equilibrated strips were layered onto home-cast 10% (v/
v) Duracryl gels (26  21 cm; 1-mm thick) in the Investigator 2nd Dimension
Running System (Genomic Solutions), and electrophoresis was carried out
using a limiting power of 20 W per gel in a discontinuous buffer system [3 L
cathode buffer (200 mmol/L Tris base, 200 mmol/L Tricine, and 14 mmol/L
SDS) and 10.5 L anode buffer (25 mmol/L Tris/acetate buffer pH 8.3)].
Gel imaging and analysis. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained
with Sypro-Ruby (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
imaged on the Pharos FX+ Imaging System (Bio-Rad) at 100-Am resolution
using a 532-nm excitation laser and a 605-nm emission filter. Images were

saved as 16 bit TIF files and analyzed by ProteomWeaver version 3.1 software
(Definiens). Automatic matching with control gels was performed with basepaired normalization to compare the spot volume data.
Protein identification. Protein spots with altered levels of expression
were excised from the gel using the ProPick excision robot (Genomic
Solution), and in-gel trypsin-digested using a ProGest Protein Digester
(Genomic Solutions). Gel plugs were first conditioned with two 20-min
incubations in 200 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) in 50% acetonitrile (50 AL) followed by 10-min incubations with acetonitrile (50 AL). The
gel plugs were then conditioned for 15 min with 25 mmol/L ABC (50 AL)
followed by 10 min in acetonitrile (50 AL). A final 5-min incubation of
acetonitrile (50 AL) preceded trypsin digestion at 37jC (3 h) using 50 ng
(5 AL each well) sequencing-grade porcine trypsin (Promega) dissolved in
25 mmol/L ABC. Digestion was stopped after 3 h, and peptides were
extracted with formic acid (10%; 5 AL each tube). Tryptic digests were
analyzed using an Ultraflex MALDI-ToF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization time-of-flight) instrument (Bruker Ltd.) at the Institute of Food
Research/John Innes Centre Joint Proteomics facility.
Proteins were identified from the peptide mass peak list by the Protein
Mass Fingerprint technique using an offline copy of Mascot search tool
(Matrix Science). SPtrEMBL was selected as sequence database; the
taxonomy group searched was Homo sapiens; trypsin was selected as the
reagent used for protein digestion with one allowed missed cleavage;
the mass tolerance was 50 ppm; peptide masses were stated to be
monoisotopic; carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine (as a fixed
modification); and methionine oxidation (as a variable modification) were
permitted. The results give a Probability Based Mowse Score, equal to
10XLog(P), where P is the probability that the observed match is a
random event. Protein scores of >61 are considered statistically significant
(P < 0.05) under the selected variables.

Western blotting. Samples (60 Ag of total cell protein extracts) were
separated under reducing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels and
transferred onto polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) with a
semidry transfer cell (Trans-Blot; Bio-Rad). Transfer was run at 15 V for
40 min. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Marvel
fat-free milk powder (5%, w/v), Tween 20 (0.05%, v/v) in PBS. Antigenic
bands were detected by exposing the membranes to primary antibodies
(Abcam) overnight at 4jC [1:500 dilution for rabbit polyclonal antibodies to
5-HT3A and 5-HT1A receptors, and mouse monoclonal (ST51-2) to serotonin
transporter (SERT); 1:1,000 dilution for rabbit polyclonal antibody to 5-HT2c
receptor; 1:5,000 for goat polyclonal antibody to aldo-keto reductase (AKR)
and rabbit polyclonal to Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor (nAChR)] followed
by incubation with secondary antibodies [1:10,000, horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat;
1:1,000, polyclonal goat anti-mouse]. Signals were detected using an
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer’s instructions and h-actin level was determined as loading control.

Results
Figure 1 shows the automatic matching between the twodimensional gel of Caco-2 cells under sulforaphane treatment and
the control. Boxes show the spots picking from the gels where
significantly different protein expression was found. To validate
protein identification analyses, two identically expressed spots
were picked from control and sulforaphane-treated gels and
successfully identified as Profilin-1 and Chaperonin 10. Characteristics of identified proteins are listed in Table 1 where protein scores

of >61 are considered statistically significant (P < 0.05). Analyses of
proteins differentially expressed showed as follows:
1. A spot was down-regulated to undetectable level after sulforaphane treatment. This spot was picked from control gels and
identified as serotonin receptor 5-HT3. To confirm the twodimensional gel findings, the effect of sulforaphane was
determined by Western blot analysis using the antibody for
5-HT3A subunit. As shown in Fig. 2, 5-HT3A (25 kDa) decreased in
a dose-dependent manner, compared with control cells, after
48 hours of exposure to sulforaphane (5 Amol/L).
2. In sulforaphane-treated gels, a higher intensity protein spot was
identified as AKR. Western blotting was used to study the effect
of sulforaphane on AKR in Caco-2 cells treated with 5, 10, and 20
Amol/L sulforaphane for 48 h. Results showed a dose-dependent
increase of AKR (35 kDa; Fig. 3), thereby confirming the twodimensional gel analyses data.
3. In sulforaphane-treated gels, another protein spot identified as
D-dopachrome decarboxylase showed a shift in isoelectric point.
Using the NetPhos 2.0 Server (Denmark) to analyze the
sequence of D-dopachrome decarboxylase, two phosphorylation
sites were predicted with high confidence scores at Ser76 (score,
0.954) and Ser78 (score, 0.993) that may account for the shift on
the two-dimensional gel.
As shown in Fig. 4, the effect of sulforaphane on neurotransmitter receptors was further investigated using Western blot
analysis. Serotonin receptors 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, and SERT were
analyzed in Caco-2 cells treated with 5, 10, and 20 Amol/L
sulforaphane for 48 h. Results showed a decrease of these proteins
in a dose-dependent manner after sulforaphane treatment. In
contrast, Western blot analyses showed a dose-dependent increase
of nAChR expression after exposure to sulforaphane (Fig. 4D).

Sulforaphane is a potent cancer preventive agent, but its
multiple mechanisms of action are not fully understood. In the
present study, we showed for the first time that sulforaphane
down-regulates the expression of three serotonin receptors in
colon cancer Caco-2 cells. In addition, a decrease of SERT protein
expression level was found in Caco-2 cells after treatment with

sulforaphane. These results suggested a potential effect on
serotonin release. Serotonin is synthesized from the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract to regulate gastrointestinal motility and epithelial function (12–14). Actions and
responses between serotonin and a wide number of 5-HT
receptors induce contraction of smooth muscle in the colon,
secretion of chloride ions and emesis (15, 16), and cellular
responses mediated by G proteins (17). Release of serotonin is
regulated by complex neuronal and humoral inputs and also by
stimulatory receptors (nicotinic acetylcholine, h-adrenergic, and
muscarine) and inhibitory receptors (a-adrenergic, g-aminobutyric acid, histamine H3-receptors, receptors for vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide, and somatostatin; ref. 18). To investigate
potential interactions of sulforaphane with these stimulatory
receptors, we found a dose-dependent up-regulation of the
nAChR in Caco-2 cells after sulforaphane treatment. Upregulation of nAChR may be due to its constant turning off by
sulforaphane, as a decrease in neurotransmitters activity is
believed to cause up-regulation of receptors (19).
The increased protein level of the stimulatory nAChR may also
explain the down-regulation of serotonin reuptake by SERT and,
finally, the down-regulation of serotonin receptors in response to
signal for serotonin release.
The majority of serotonin receptors are G-protein–coupled
receptors (GPCR; ref. 17), exception being the 5-HT3 receptor,
which is a ligand-gated ion channel playing a role in emesis, anxiety,
and intestinal smooth-muscle activation (20). GPCR is a large family
of cell surface receptors that activate signal transduction pathways
and cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation. Studies reported the sequence of
events by which a signal molecule activates cAMP signaling. It has
been shown that cAMP activates protein kinase A, which in turn
phosphorylates Src and subsequently activates the Erk1/2 cascade
(21). Activation of Erk1/2 has been associated with the upregulation of COX-2 activity (22).
Previous studies showed that activation of neurotransmitter
receptors has a role in colon cancer cells. Activation of hadrenoceptors in colon cancer HT-29 cells increased cytosolic
phospholipase A2 protein expression, COX-2 mRNA and protein
expression, as well as prostaglandin E2 receptor (PGE2) release (23).
Studies have also shown that activation of muscarinic M3 receptor
up-regulated COX-2 and resulted in PGE2 production (24). In
another study, activation of a7-nAChR (a7-nAChR) by nicotinestimulated HT-29 cell proliferation and adrenaline production (25).
In agreement with previous findings, proteomics data described
here also revealed changes in expression of AKR (26) and Ddopachrome decarboxylase. AKR is abundantly expressed in the
gastrointestinal tract and catalyzes the reduction of xenobiotics

with broad substrate specificity. Interestingly, recent studies
reported how members of AKR family efficiently reduced the
antiemetic 5-HT3 receptor antagonist dolasetron (27, 28).
D-dopachrome decarboxylase is involved in the detoxification of
the toxic quinine product of dopamine. Chung and colleagues (29)
observed a similar effect of h-phenylethyl isothiocyanate on Ddopachrome decarboxylase in a proteomic investigation using
human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Recent studies reported that
sulforaphane protects against compounds known to induce
dopamine quinone production (30). Oxidation of dopamine, which
is a precursor of adrenaline, to dopamine quinone causes oxidative
stress.
In conclusion, this research suggests that a potential cancer
preventive agent sulforaphane regulates neurotransmitter receptors in Caco-2 cells. Understanding these effects of sulforaphane
could provide new insights into development of new therapies or
therapeutic agents for colon cancer prevention.
