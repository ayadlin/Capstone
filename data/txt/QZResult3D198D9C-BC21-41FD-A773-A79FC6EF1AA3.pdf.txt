BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent, has activity in lymphoproliferative disorders. The
authors, therefore, evaluated its effects on T-cell immunophenotype and cytokine production in patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: To study the immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide in CLL, the authors
recruited 24 patients with untreated CLL enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial of lenalidomide and obtained peripheral
blood specimens for immunologic studies consisting of enumeration of T cells and assessing their ability to synthesize cytokines after activation through T-cell receptor (TCR). RESULTS: After 3 cycles of therapy, patients had a significant reduction in percentage (%) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and an increase in percentage of T cells,
percentage of activated CD8þ T cells producing IFN-c, and percentage of regulatory T (TR) cells when compared with
their respective levels before treatment. After 15 cycles of treatment, responder patients had significant reduction in
percentage of lymphocytes and ALC, percentage of activated CD4þ T cells producing IL-2, IFN-c, or TNF-a, and percentage of TR cells when compared with their perspective levels after 3 cycles of treatment. Furthermore, the numbers of activated CD4þ T cells producing IL-2, IFN-c, or TNF-a, activated CD8þ T cells producing IFN-c, and TR cells
normalized to the range of healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with lenalidomide resulted in the normalization of functional T-cell subsets in responders, suggesting that lenalidomide may modulate cell-mediated immunity in

Lenalidomide ((RS)-3-(4-amino-1-oxo-3H-isoindol-2-yl)piperidine-2,6-dione) has shown clinical activity
in several hematological disorders, including multiple myeloma (MM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).1,2 The relevant mechanisms of action of lenalidomide vary by disease setting.
In multiple myeloma, lenalidomide increases the apoptotic rate of neoplastic plasma cells, inhibits cell adhesion, and
induces changes in the bone marrow microenvironment by inhibiting adhesion of myeloma cells to the bone marrow
stromal cell3; whereas in del(5q) MDS, lenalidomide directly affects erythroid progenitors by upregulating activin
A and the tumor suppressor gene SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine).4 In CLL, lenalidomide’s
mechanisms of action are not fully understood, and several possibilities are currently being considered, including
suppression of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), inhibition of angiogenesis, and activation of
natural killer cells.5

With new agents available to patients with CLL, the
management of CLL becomes increasingly personalized.6
Lenalidomide offers a beneficial effect in patients with
refractory/relapsed CLL, yet fatigue, thrombocytopenia,
and neutropenia were frequently observed, and tumor
flare reactions, characterized by painful lymphadenopathy
with or without fever and bone pain, were reported in a
subset of patients.7,8 Nevertheless, a recent trial with the
combination of lenalidomide and rituximab demonstrated superior treatment effects to lenalidomide alone
and no increase in toxicity.9 Unfortunately, lenalidomide
in combination with fludarabine and rituximab in previously untreated CLL patients was very poorly tolerated
when administered concurrently.10
The stimulatory effects of lenalidomide on both humoral11 and cellular immunity12,13 have been attributed
to its ability to restore T-cell immune synapse formation12,13 and the CD154 expression on B-CLL cells with
subsequent activation phenotype.11 Furthermore, it has
been suggested that lenalidomide-associated immune activation is responsible for tumor flare reactions, a unique
phenomenon seen only in CLL patients. To determine
the effect of lenalidomide treatment on cell-mediated
immunity of treatment-naive CLL patients, we measured
changes in the immunophenotypes of T cells, including
regulatory T (TR) cells, and the ability of CD4þ and
CD8þ T cells to synthesize cytokines after activation
through the T-cell receptor (TCR) with immobilized
anti-CD3 antibodies. Cytoplasmic cytokine staining of
cells identified by their surface antigens provided unique
opportunities to detect cytokine expression within individual cells and to gather important information regarding the functionality of T cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment
Sixty treatment-naive CLL patients were enrolled in a
phase 2 clinical trial of lenalidomide; 24 patients agreed to
provide 15 mL of peripheral blood for optional immunologic studies before treatment after receiving 3 cycles and
15 cycles of treatment. To be eligible for this study,
patients had to be aged 65 years or older and have standard indications for treatment according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) and International Workshop on CLL
(IWCLL) guidelines.14 Treatment consisted of lenalidomide 5 mg daily continuous for each 28-day cycle. Completion of 2 28-day cycles (56 days) was required before
escalating the daily lenalidomide dose to 10 mg, and then

4000

further escalation up to 25 mg daily by increments of 5
mg per cycle was allowed. The treatment was continued
until disease progression. This study was approved by The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board and registered at clinical trial.gov as
NCT00535873– Lenalidomide as Initial Treatment of
Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Aged
65 and Older. All patients provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki before
participation in this study. Patients were evaluated for
clinical response according to the National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCI-WG) criteria15 after 3 cycles
of treatment and every 6 cycles thereafter when they
remained on treatment. In addition, we recruited 22 agematched healthy subjects to participate in the study as a
control group for data analyses.
Enumeration of T-Cell Subsets and TR Cells
We enumerated lymphocyte subsets as previously
described.16 Briefly, 100 lL aliquots of peripheral blood
were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody
reagents to detect T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4, and CD8).
Surface expressions of CD3, CD4, and CD25 were determined by using mouse antibodies conjugated with peridinin chlorophyll protein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and
phycoerythrin, respectively.
Expression of the Forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3)
is important in the differentiation of natural TR cells.17
TR cells were enumerated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by using the FoxP3 staining kit (BD
Pharmingen, San Diego, California) according to the
manufacturer’s recommended protocol. All reagents were
purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, California).
Mouse immunoglobulin isotype controls were used to
control autofluorescence.
Measurement of Cytokines Synthesis by
Activated T Cells
PBMC were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation and stored at 80 C
in fetal bovine serum (FBS) with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide.
Upon thawing, PBMC were suspended in complete medium consisting of RPMI-1640 (Whittaker Bioproduct,
Walkersville, Maryland) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin (Whittaker Bioproduct), 100 lg/mL of streptomycin (Whittaker Bioproduct), and 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO, Grand Island,
New York). PBMC (6  106) were activated through the
T-cell receptor (TCR) by anti-CD3 antibodies that were

immobilized to the surface of a 24-well plate (Costar,
Cambridge, Massachusetts). Briefly, the bottom of each
well of a 24-well plate was coated with 0.75 lg of antiCD3 (Coulter Immunology, Hialeah, Florida), and the
plate was incubated at 37 C for 6 hours. Thereafter, the
plates were air-dried with the plate lid off in a laminar
flow hood. One mL of complete medium, 1.5 lg of antiCD28 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California), and 106
PBMC were added to each well coated with anti-CD3,
and the plate was incubated at 37 C for 16 to 18 hours.
Ten lg of brefeldin A were added to each milliliter of
PBMC culture for the last 3 hours of the incubation
period. Next, a total of 6  106 activated PBMC were harvested and treated with monoclonal antibody reagents for
the detection of the intracellular cytokines produced by
activated T cells as previously described.16,18
Statistical analysis

The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used to compare the differences in levels of white blood
cell count (WBC), percentage and absolute lymphocyte
counts, T-cell subsets (including TR cells), and activated
T cells synthesizing cytokines at pretreatment versus their
respective levels after 3 cycles of treatment as well as for
comparing their levels after 3 cycles versus after 15 cycles
of treatment. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the differences in median of WBC, percentage and
absolute count of lymphocytes, T-cell subsets (including
TR cells), and TCR-activated T cells producing cytokines
IL-2, IL-10, IFN-c, or TNF-a between healthy subjects
and patients at pretreatment, after 3 cycles or after 15
cycles of treatment.

RESULTS
Patient Population
The clinical characteristics of the 24 patients studied are
listed in Table 1. Six patients did not respond to treatment
and were taken off study after 3 cycles. Eighteen patients
had partial responses (PR) after 3 or 9 cycles of treatment
including 3 nodal partial responses (nPR) after 9 cycles of
therapy. Four patients had complete responses (CR), and
2 patients had incomplete CR (CRi) after 15 or 21 cycles
of treatment.
Nine of 24 patients had Rai stages III or IV (Rai
Classification system for CLL), and the median serum
beta-2 microglobulin (b2M) was 4.2 mg/dL (range, 2.1 to
12.0 mg/dL). Immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGVH) variable gene sequencing was determined on leukemia cells of

Cancer

September 1, 2011

22 patients and 14 (64%) had unmutated (2% deviation from germline) IGVH. Expression of ZAP-70 was
measured by immunocytochemistry in 18 patients, of
whom 10 (56%) were positive. Twenty-two patients had
cytogenetic abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing, 7 had chromosome 13q deletion,
and 8 had chromosome 11q deletion. Peripheral blood
was collected from patients before initiation of therapy
(n ¼ 24), after 3 cycles (n ¼ 24), and again after 15 cycles
(n ¼ 17) of treatment.
On the basis of the 60 patients enrolled in the study,
the most common toxicity was grade 3-4 neutropenia,
which occurred in 34% of evaluable treatment cycles.
Other hematological toxicities were less common with
grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and anemia occurring in
only 12% and <1% of cycles, respectively. Grade 1 and 2
toxicities were more common and included fatigue
(75%), diarrhea (52%), constipation (48%), rash (47%),
and/or pruritus (42%). Grade 1 or 2 tumor flare reactions
occurred in 48% of patients, but these were generally mild
and treated with short administration of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, or dose adjustment of
lenalidomide. There were no grade 3 or 4 episodes of
tumor flare or tumor lysis in this study. (Xavier Badoux
et al, personal communication).
Lenalidomide Significantly Lowered the
Absolute Count of Lymphocytes and T Cells
The median WBC at start of treatment was 100.2 
103/lL. Along with significant reductions in WBC (11.9
 103/lL) after 3 cycles of treatment (P ¼ .000), there
were significant decreases in the ALC as well as absolute
count of T cells of CLL patients (P ¼ .000 and P ¼ .009,
respectively; Fig. 1). After 15 cycles of treatment, patients
had further reductions in WBC (4.8  103/lL) and ALC
(2.5  103/lL) with median values within the normal
range for healthy subjects established at the University of
Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center (Fig. 1). In addition,
the median number of T cells of CLL patients was also
within the normal range of healthy subjects.
Lenalidomide Significantly Lowered the
Percentage of Lymphocytes and Increased
the Percentages of T Cells
The median percentage of lymphocytes at the start of
treatment was 90.5%. After 3 cycles of therapy, there was
a significant decreases in the percentage of lymphocytes
(P ¼ .004), and further reduction was observed after 15
cycles (P ¼ .002; Fig. 1). However, despite significant

significantly higher median percentage of lymphocytes
than healthy subjects (55.0% vs 26.5%, P ¼ .000).
The median percentage of T cells at the start of treatment was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects

There were significant differences between CLL patients and healthy subjects with respect to cytokine synthesis by TCR-activated CD4þ or CD8þ T cells.

Cytokine Synthesis by Activated CD81 T Cells
Is Affected by Treatment With Lenalidomide
Whereas the percentages of activated CD8þ T cells synthesizing IL-2, IFN-c, or TNF-a before initiation of
treatment were similar to those of healthy subjects, interestingly the percentage of activated CD8þ T cells producing IFN-c after 3 cycles of therapy was significantly
increased (Table 2). Moreover, the median numbers of
activated CD8þ T cells producing IL-2, IFN-c, or TNF-a
were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects at
pretreatment and after 3 cycles of therapy, but they were
significantly decreased after 15 cycles of therapy and
became comparable to those of healthy subjects (Fig. 3).
The Percentage and Absolute Number of
TR Cells Normalized During Treatment
With Lenalidomide
The median percentage of TR cells was 2.2% at pretreatment and significantly increased after 3 cycles of treatment (P ¼ .015; Fig. 4). However, after 15 cycles of
treatment, the median percentage and absolute number of
TR cells decreased significantly and were equivalent to
that of healthy subjects.

DISCUSSION
Treatment of B-CLL patients with lenalidomide significantly decreased the total number of lymphocytes and T
cells to levels observed in healthy subjects. Similarly and
more importantly, after 15 cycles of treatment, the percentages of T-cell subsets that synthesized cytokines resembled
those of healthy subjects. In particular, the numbers of

4004

CD4þIL-2þ T-helper and CD8þIFN-cþ T cells were
restored to the normal range for healthy subjects.
T-cell dysfunction in patients with CLL may contribute to the progression of disease,19 and others have
reported that CLL patients have increased numbers of TR
cells20 that are responsible for suppression of cytokine
production. Multiple T-cell abnormalities including overexpression of CD3 zeta chain and ZAP-70 in CLL
patients with indolent disease indicated a state of chronic
and aberrant activation of T cells.21 Thus, it was not unexpected that T-cell responses before treatment, ie, percentage of activated CD4þ T cells producing IL-2, IFN-c, or
TNF-a, were significantly higher when compared with
those of healthy subjects, and the heightened activation
through the TCR could be related to the intrinsic activation of T cells by B-CLL cells. Despite reductions in absolute number of T cells after 3 cycles of therapy, the
residual T cells retained their ability to synthesize cytokines. This was followed by significant reductions in the
percentages of activated CD4þ and CD8þ T cells that
synthesized IL-2, IFN-c, or TNF-a after 15 cycles of therapy. In addition, the median numbers of activated CD4þ
T cells that produced IL-2, IFN-c, or TNF-a and activated CD8þ T cells that produced IFN-c were equivalent
to those of healthy subjects.
Gorgun and collaborators have suggested a role for
leukemic B cells in T-cell dependent immune deficiency.
They observed that coculturing B-CLL cells with normal
T cells resulted in the inability of CD4þ T cells to differentiate into Th1 cells and CD8þ T cells with defective cytotoxic ability.22 Interestingly, in our study, there was a

Asterisks represent significant differences between responses of healthy subjects (HS) and those of CLL patients at the designated time points during treatment.

significant transient increase in percentages of activated
CD8þ T cells producing IFN-c after 3 cycles of treatment
with lenalidomide (Fig. 3). These data suggest that cellmediated cytotoxicity may be involved in the clinical activity of lenalidomide. This mechanism is supported by
other studies reporting that the administration of lenalidomide to TCL1 mice reversed the dysfunctional immunological synapse formation between T cells and leukemic
cells.12,22
The role of IL-10 in the pathogenesis of CLL is still
controversial, as some investigators have reported IL-10 as

the median percentage of IL-10–producing CD4þ T cells
of CLL patients at pretreatment was significantly lower

than that of the healthy subjects, the median level was further decreased after 3 cycles of treatment. These data tend
to support the hypothesis that decreased IL-10 production
may relate to increased apoptosis of CLL cells as suggested
by another in vitro study.25
Natural TR cells are believed to arise as a suppressive
population within the thymus,26 but there is evidence that
they may also arise peripherally.27 In humans, TR cells
compose about 1% to 2% of circulating CD3þCD4þ T
cells that coexpress the IL-2 receptor-a (IL-2Ra or
CD25) at high density (CD25hi).28 CLL patients have
been reported to have an increase in TR cells, which were
reduced after thalidomide therapy.29 In our study, there
was a transient increase (18%) in the percentage of TR
cells in the peripheral blood after 3 cycles of treatment

(Fig. 4) that was followed by a significant decrease
(40%) in TR cells after 15 cycles of treatment (P ¼
.001). The transient increase of TR cells after 3 cycles of
therapy may be explained by the activation of CD4þ T
cells through increased circulating tumor antigens30 associated with the destruction of B-CLL cells by lenalidomide.31 We suggest that whereas the transient increase in
TR cells after 3 cycles of treatment may be beneficial by
preventing the development of the tumor flare reaction in
patients receiving lenalidomide, the subsequent reduction
in percentages of TR cells after 15 cycles of therapy is consistent with the in vitro inhibitory effect of lenalidomide
on TR cells.32 Interestingly, patients with complete
responses had significantly higher percentages of CD4þ T
cells and low percentages of TR cells when compared with
patients who experienced partial response after 15 cycles
of treatment.

Lastly, lenalidomide induced significant reductions
in the level of serum cytokines, TNF-a, and its soluble
receptor sTNF-R1, angiogenesis factor bFGF, inflammatory factors IL-1RA and IL-10, and chemokine MIP-1a
in CLL patients after 9 cycles of therapy. The results
further substantiate the immunomodulatory effects of
lenalidomide in CLL patients. To date, there have been
limited attempts to reverse immune defects in CLL
patients. A recent clinical trial among CLL patients with
high-risk cytogenetics treated with lenalidomide showed a
38% overall response rate, with 19% of patients achieving
a complete response.33 We previously reported that treatment with lenalidomide was associated with an overall
response rate of 31% in CLL patients with 11q or 17p deletion, of 24% in patients with unmutated V(H), and of
25% in patients with fludarabine-refractory disease.31
These studies suggest that the restoration of immune

function have the potential to effectively eliminate B-CLL
cells. Despite the small sample size due to the limited
number of participants for this optional immunologic
study, herein, we have provided evidence that treatment
with lenalidomide modulates T-cell immunity profiles of
CLL patients and that changes in the proportion of functional T-cell subsets may reverse CLL-related immune
defects and contribute to a favorable clinical response.
