Genetic heterogeneity and signaling alterations diminish the effectiveness of single-agent therapies in
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). HSP90 is a molecular chaperone for several signaling proteins that are
deregulated in glioma cells. Thus, HSP90 inhibition may offer an approach to coordinately correct multiple
signaling pathways as a strategy for GBM therapy. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a novel HSP90 inhibitor,
NVP-HSP990, in glioma tumor–initiating cell (GIC) populations, which are strongly implicated in the root
pathobiology of GBM. In GIC cultures, NVP-HSP990 elicited a dose-dependent growth inhibition with IC50 values
in the low nanomolar range. Two GIC subgroups with different responses were observed with an Olig2-expressing
subset relatively more sensitive to treatment. We also showed that Olig2 is a functional marker associated with cell
proliferation and response to NVP-HSP990, as NVP-HSP990 attenuated cell proliferation in Olig2-high GIC lines.
In addition, NVP-HSP990 disrupted cell-cycle control mechanism by decreasing CDK2 and CDK4 and elevating
apoptosis-related molecules. Mechanistic investigations revealed molecular interactions between CDK2/CDK4
and Olig2. Inhibition of CDK2/CDK4 activity disrupted Olig2–CDK2/CDK4 interactions and attenuated Olig2
protein stability. In vivo evaluation showed a relative prolongation of median survival in an intracranial model of
GIC growth. Our results suggest that GBM characterized by high-expressing Olig2 GIC may exhibit greater
sensitivity to NVP-HSP990 treatment, establishing a foundation for further investigation of the role of HSP90
signaling in GBM. Cancer Res; 73(10); 3062–74. 2013 AACR.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common adult
glioma, is associated with a dismal prognosis not only because
of the high degree of genetic heterogeneity among patients and
even within individual tumors but also because of its dynamic
genetic instability. The most frequently altered genes are
CDKN2A, TP53, EGFR, PTEN, and RB (1). Signal transduction
pathways are not linear; they are complex, overlapping, and
crosstalking, which may allow alternative pathways to compensate when one is disrupted, potentially leading to resistance to single agents that affect only one target (2). Simulta-

neously targeting multiple molecules that are deregulated is
critical to designing a successful therapeutic strategy for GBM.
HSPs are a highly conserved family of molecular chaperones,
which can be upregulated to protect cells from potentially
lethal stress. Upregulated HSPs may partially account for
glioma cell's ability to survive the otherwise fatal hypoxic
environment and tolerate genetic alterations (3). HSP90 is
induced in response to cellular stress and stabilizes client
proteins involved in cell-cycle control and proliferation/antiapoptotic signaling (4). By binding and chaperoning proteins,
HSP90 can buffer the genetic variation at the protein level (5).
Many of HSP900 s more than 100 client proteins, including P53,
CDK4, ErbB2, PI3K, PTEN, AKT, Raf, c-MET, and EGFR, are
reported to be involved in the major aberrant signal transduction pathways identiﬁed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA;
refs. 6–9). An advantage of HSP90 inhibitors is their ability to
affect multiple oncoproteins simultaneously, including targets
considered "undruggable," and thus they may largely avoid
generating resistant phenotypes arising from mutation, activation of alternative signaling pathways, or feedback loops seen
with therapeutics targeting a single oncogene or pathway (10).
Tumor-initiating cells are functionally deﬁned through their
capacity for sustained self-renewal and tumorigenicity. Glioma
tumor–initiating cells (GIC) retain relevant molecular features
of GBMs and enable preclinical models for evaluation of both
tumor biology and therapeutics (11). GIC maintenance is

Cell proliferation analysis
Dissociated GICs were plated at 10 cells/mL in 6-well plates
and incubated with various concentrations of NVP-HSP990 for
7 days. Formed tumorspheres were dissociated into single cells
and counted with hemocytometer using 0.2% Trypan blue

Cell lines and reagents
The GIC lines were established by isolating neurosphereforming cells from surgical specimens of human GBM using a
method described previously (14, 15) The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
These GIC lines were cultured as GBM neurospheres in
DMEM/F12 medium containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen)
and bFGF and EGF (20 ng/mL each). 17-N-allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and retinoic acid (RA) were
obtained from Sigma. The HSP90 inhibitor NVP-HSP990 was
provided by Novartis. NVP-HSP990 was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide to a concentration of 10 mmol/L. Normal human
astrocyte (NHA) was maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. Human fetal
brain neural stem cell line HFB2050 was kindly provided by Dr.
Evan Snyder (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) and cultured as
described previously (15).

Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested in a lysis solution as previously described
(17) and subjected to Western blotting. Membranes were probed
with the following primary antibodies: anti-HSP90, anti-HSP70,
anti-HSP27, anti-PDGFRa, anti-AKT, anti-CDK4, anti-CDK2,
anti-cleaved-caspase-7, anti-cleaved-caspase-8, anti-Bim, antiphosphop-Rb (Ser807/811), and anti-p27 (all from Cell Signaling), Olig2 antibody was purchased from Chemicon, and b-actin
antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich.

regulated by an interconnected regulatory circuit consisting of
many HSP90 client proteins including AKT and STAT3 (12, 13).
Because HSP90 is involved in redundant pathways for maintaining cell viability, its inhibition has the potential to block
expression of multiple client proteins involved in tumorigenesis. Therefore, there seems to be a compelling rationale to
evaluate an HSP90 inhibitor in GIC models. The aim of the
current study therefore was to evaluate the effects and mechanism of an HSP90 inhibitor in GICs both in vitro and in vivo.

Drug cytotoxicity analysis
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2  103 cells/well) and
incubated at 37 C for 24 hours before serial dilutions of
NVP-HSP990 were added. Growth inhibition was determined
using the CellTiter-Blue cell viability assay (Promega). Cell
viability in the vehicle control was considered as to be 100%.
The IC50 value was calculated by using Calcusyn version 2.0
software (Biosoft) as the mean drug concentration required
to inhibit cell proliferation by 50% compared with vehicletreated controls.

Cell-cycle analysis
GIC tumorspheres were dissociated using Accutase enzyme
cocktails (Invitrogen) and plated at a density of 2  105 cells per
well in 60 mm plates. The cells were treated with NVP-HSP990
for 24 hours, ﬁxed in 70% ethanol, and stored at 20 C. Cells
were stained with propidium iodide for cell-cycle analysis
using a BD FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).
Immunoprecipitation
The immunoprecipitation procedure was conducted as
described previously (16). Brieﬂy, after NVP-HSP990 (50
nmol/L) or 17-AAG (500 nmol/L) treatment for 2 hours, cells
were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer, and precleared
by incubation with poly(G) immunoprecipitation beads for 1
hour at 4 C. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant (200
mg of lysate protein) was subjected to immunoprecipitation.

Indirect immunoﬂuorescence staining
Immunoﬂuorescence staining was conducted as described
previously (18). Brieﬂy, GICs were grown on chamber slides
precoated with poly-lysine–coated coverslips, cells were ﬁxed
with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeated with 0.25% Triton X100, and blocked with 3% normal goat serum. Immunostaining
was conducted using the appropriate primary and secondary
antibodies, and images were acquired using a confocal laser
scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy).
Immunohistochemistry analysis
Immunohistochemistry was conducted as described previously (19). Brieﬂy, after dewaxing and antigen retrieval, tissue
sections were incubated with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Sections were stained 3,3-diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide chromogen substrate (DAKO) and
counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. Images were
acquired using a Zeiss Microsystems ﬂuorescence microscope
linked to a DFC340FX camera (Carl Zeiss Microscopy).
TUNEL assay
Apoptosis was determined using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end
labeling (TUNEL) method using in situ cell death detection
reagent (Roche Applied Science). The percentage of TUNELlabeled cells in each section was determined at a magniﬁcation
of 400 by counting 500 cells in a randomly selected ﬁeld.
Reverse-phase protein arrays
After NVP-HSP990 (50 nmol/L) treatment for 24 hours, cells
were collected and lysed in a buffer consisting of a 2.5%
solution of 2-mercaptoethanol in loading buffer/T-PER
(Pierce) plus phosphatase and protease inhibitors. All samples

unpaired t test. Results are presented as the mean  SD of at

NVP-HSP990 displays dose- and time-dependent effects
on HSP90 client proteins
Examination of some known HSP90 client proteins, including PDGFRa, CDK4, and AKT, revealed a dose- and timedependent decrease in GIC line GSC11, which is consistent
with the idea that the responsiveness of these cells to NVPHSP990 is a results of the degradation of HSP90 client proteins
(Fig. 1A and B). GIC lines such as GSC13, GSC16, and GSC23

of M.D Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) in accordance
with institutional rules. The antitumor efﬁcacy of NVP-HSP990
was examined in intracranial xenografts derived from 2 GIC
lines, GSC11 and GSC20. To create the intracranial disease
model, we engrafted GICs (5  105) into the caudate nucleus of
Nude (nu/nu) 6- to 8-week-old mice using a previously
described guide-screw system (21) and then randomly divided
the mice into 4 groups of 14 mice in each group. Starting on day
4 after the tumor cells implantation, mice were treated by oral
gavages with 10 mg/kg NVP-HSP990 in methylcellulose or with
an equal volume of methylcellulose alone (vehicle control) on a

schedule of once per week for 5 weeks. After NVP-HSP990
treatment for 2 or 4 weeks, 2 animals from each group were

NVP-HSP990 targets a subset of GICs
We tested the effects of NVP-HSP990 against a panel of 14
GIC lines. NVP-HSP990 inhibited GIC proliferation in all GIC
lines, with IC50 values ranging approximately between 10
and 500 nmol/L (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we observed a
differential response in these GIC lines and divided them

NVP-HSP990 attenuates GIC proliferation and induces
neuronal differentiation
We selected 2 GIC lines in the responder group (GSC11 and
GSC13) and 2 cell lines in the nonresponder group (GSC2
and GSC20) to study NVP-HSP990 effect on cell proliferation
and differentiation. Tumorspheres that formed from NVPHSP990–treated GICs were smaller and fewer than those
formed from control untreated GSC11 cells (Fig. 2A). Treatment with NVP-HSP990 markedly decreased the proliferation
of responder GICs (Fig. 2B). In addition, NVP-HSP990 treatment markedly impaired the proliferative potential of responder GICs, as shown by the decreased positivity of Ki-67 staining
in treated cells (Fig. 2C). Limiting dilution assay also showed
that NVP-HSP990 attenuated the self-renewal potential in
GSC11 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Thus, our data indicated
that inhibition of HSP90 by NVP-HSP990 is associated with
attenuation of GIC proliferation at the functional levels.
To further determine the effect of inhibiting HSP90 on GIC
differentiation, exposure of GICs to either differentiation condition solution (1% FBS þ 1 mmol/L retinoic acid in DMEM/
F12) or to NVP-HSP990 (50 nmol/L) for 5 days differentiated
GICs into 3 neural lineages, as GFAP, TuJ1, NeuN, and CNPasestainined cells increased following induction by 1% FBS þ 1
mmol/L retinoic acid. Surprisingly, NVP-HSP990 treatment
only considerably increased neuronal marker TuJ1 and NeuN
expression and did not alter GFAP and CNPase in responder
GICs, suggesting that NVP-HSP990 mainly triggered neuronal
lineage-restricted differentiation (Fig. 2D). Consistently, the
expression of stem cell related genes such as CD133, Nestin,
Sox2, and Olig2 decreased following NVP-HSP990 treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). However, the nonresponder cells
(GSC2 and GSC20) did not show much staining of TuJ1 and

NeuN after NVP-HSP990 treatment (Fig. 2E). Nevertheless, RAdifferentiated GICs seemed less sensitive to NVP-HSP990
treatment, as the IC50 value of the RA-differentiated GICs were
higher than GICs grown in stem cell medium (Supplementary
Fig. S2C).
NVP-HSP990 targets GICs with high Olig2 expression
To correlate the drug response with the lineage characteristics of GICs, immunostaining on 13 lineage markers showed
that all responder GIC lines exhibited high Olig2 expression,
also shown by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 3B), as compared
with nonresponder GIC lines (Fig. 3A). Gene expression analysis also conﬁrmed that Olig2 is the top marker associated with
response to NVP-HSP990 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Treatment
of responder GIC line, GSC11, with HSP990 (50 nmol/L) for
different times points showed that Olig2 protein levels markedly decreased after 24 hours of treatment and disappeared after
72 hours (Fig. 3C) accompanied with increased NeuN staining
(Fig. 3D).
Olig2 might be a functional marker associated with cell
proliferation and response to NVP-HSP990
Olig2 has a well-established function in regulating the
proliferation of neural progenitors and glioma cells. In our
study, we showed that Olig2-high glioma cells displayed high
Ki-67 labeling in GSC11 cell line (Fig. 4A). To further evaluate
the role of Olig2 on GIC proliferation, Olig2 knockdown GICs
and cell lines ectopically expressing Olig2 in GSC23 were
generated. Olig2-high GSC11 and GSC13 cells showed slower
cell proliferation rates following Olig2 knockdown (Fig. 4B and
C) and GSC23-expressing ectopic Olig2 showed increased cell
proliferation (Fig. 4D and E) indicating Olig2 might regulate the
proliferation of GICs.
The observation that NVP-HSP990 attenuates the cell proliferation of GICs with high Olig2 prompted us to hypothesize

that Olig2 might be a functional molecule associated with
response to NVP-HSP990. To conﬁrm this hypothesis, we
tested the effect of NVP-HSP990 on various cell models manipulating Olig2 expression. Our results showed that Olig2-knockdown GIC lines (GSC11/shOlig2 and GSC13/shOlig2) were less
sensitive to NVP-HSP990 treatment as compared with GSC11/
shscr and GSC13/shscr (P < 0.05; Fig. 4F). Consistent with this
ﬁnding, we showed that Ki-67 index in the Olig2 knockdown
GICs is lower than shscr, whereas it decreased slightly, as
compared with shscr control following NVP-HSP990 treatment
(Fig. 4G). In parallel, overexpression of Olig2 in GSC23-a low
Olig2-expressing cell line sensitized GSC23 to NVP-HSP990
treatment, as compared with GFP control (Fig. 4H, P < 0.05).
These results suggested that Olig2 might be a functional

signiﬁcant change in the proportion of cells in S-phase in
nonresponder GIC lines (P > 0.05). TUNEL staining conﬁrmed that the NVP-HSP990 induced apoptosis in both
GSC11 and GSC13 cell lines, whereas minimal induction of
apoptosis was observed in the nonresponder GIC lines GSC2
and GSC20 (Fig. 5D). The combined treatment of NVPHSP990 with chemotherapeutic drugs etoposide and topotecan (known apoptosis inducer) showed enhanced TUNEL

labeling, implicating a potential combinational strategy to
eliminate GICs (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results suggested that the disruption of cell-cycle regulation and the
induction of apoptosis might be crucial for NVP-HSP9900 s
effect on responder GICs.
NVP-HSP990 promotes degradation of HSP90 client
proteins CDK2 and CDK4 in GICs
Because CDK2 and CDK4 were previously reported to be the
major kinases for Rb phosphorylation at S807/S811 and to be
client proteins for HSP90 (22–24), we tested the possibility that
the alteration of cell-cycle–related molecules by NVP-HSP990
might result from the attenuation of CDK2 and CDK4 expression. Coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that HSP90 was
associated with both CDK2 and CDK4 in GSC11 and GSC13 cell
lysate (Fig. 6A) and inhibition of HSP90 by either NVP-HSP990
(50 nmol/L, 2 hours) or the reference inhibitor 17-AAG (500
nmol/L, 2 hours) disrupted the interactions between HSP90
and CDK2/4 (Fig. 6B).

To further investigate the function of CDK2 and CDK4 in the
stem cell maintenance, treatment with ﬂavopiridol (FLP: a
selective inhibitor of CDK2 and CDK4) decreased phosphorylated Rb levels and increased p27 expression (Fig. 6C). Similar
to NVP-HSP990, FLP treatment showed similar distribution of
responder and nonresponder GIC lines in cytotoxicity assay
(Fig. 6D), a marked reduction of Ki-67 index (Fig. 6E), and
induction of apoptosis in responder GIC lines GSC11 and
GSC13 (Fig. 6F). Therefore, NVP-HSP990 might promote the
protein degradation of CDK2 and CDK4 and consequently
impair GIC proliferation.
CDK2/4 interacts with Olig2 and regulates its protein
stability
We showed that NVP-HSP990 affects both Olig2 and CDK2/4
function in regulating GIC proliferation, and HSP90 does not
directly interact with Olig2 protein. Therefore, we hypothesized that HSP90 client protein CDK2/4 might interact with
Olig2 to regulate its function. Coimmunoprecipitation assays

www.aacrjournals.org

showed that endogenous Olig2 physiologically interacts with
CDK2/4 in GSC11 cells (Fig. 7A) and treatment with FLP
disrupted this interaction between CDK2/4 and Olig2 in
Olig2-transfected 293T cells suggesting that CDK2/4 activities
might be crucial to maintain this interaction between CDK2/4
and Olig2 (Fig. 7B).
To show that interaction of CDK2/4 with Olig2 might
regulate Olig2 expression and more importantly Olig2 protein stability, we measured the protein stability of Olig2
protein following CDK2/4 inhibition after protein synthesis
was blocked by cycloheximide (CHX). Results show that
Olig2 levels were decreased more rapidly in FLP-treated
GSC11 cells, as Olig2 protein almost disappeared after FLP
treatment for 2 hours (Fig. 7C). Time course treatment with
FLP in GSC11 cells showed that Olig2 protein dramatically
decreased after 12-hour treatment and completely disappeared after 24 hours. This decrease in Olig2 was also
accompanied with downregulated p-Rb and increased p27
(Fig. 7D). Therefore, NVP-HSP990 might affect Olig2 protein

NVP-HSP990 suppresses tumor growth and improves
survival in an orthotopic mouse model of GBM
Therapeutic efﬁcacy of NVP-HSP990 (10 mg/kg) was shown
by increase in median survival times to 58 days (95% conﬁdence interval: 52–64 days) in comparison with 46 (95%
conﬁdence interval: 45–47 days) days in the vehicle control
group for GSC11 (P < 0.01; Fig. 8B, Supplementary Table S1).
However, NVP-HSP990 treatment had no effect on the median
survival of GSC20 xenografted animals (P ¼ 0.4897). Histopathologic staining revealed that NVP-HSP990 considerably
reduced the tumor growth in GSC11 xenografts, as shown by
decreased tumor mass in animals treated for 4 weeks with
NVP-HSP990 in comparison with vehicle control. However, the
tumor mass in GSC20 xenograft showed mild reduction following NVP-HSP990 treatment (Fig. 8A).
NVP-HSP990 suppresses proliferation and induces
apoptosis and differentiation in GIC xenografts
The orthotopic tumors after NVP-HSP990 treatment for 4
weeks were analyzed for biologic effects. The levels of HSP90

3070

Cancer Res; 73(10) May 15, 2013

client proteins CDK2 and CDK4 were lower in NVP-HSP990–
treated GSC11 tumors than in untreated tumors, suggesting
NVP-HSP990 suppressed HSP90 activities in vivo. In addition,
the treated tumors showed decreased Ki-67 positivity and
increased cell TUNEL labeling (Fig. 9 and Supplementary Fig.
S5) indicating that NVP-HSP990 suppressed proliferation and
induced apoptosis in the responder GIC tumors. Furthermore,
reduced Olig2 expression was accompanied by increased p27
and TuJ1 positivity after NVP-HSP990 treatment.

Discussion
We have shown that NVP-HSP990, a HSP90 inhibitor, suppresses the oncogenic properties of a subgroup of high Olig2
expressing GICs with respect to cell proliferation, induces
neuronal differentiation, and affects survival in mice. Furthermore, our results indicate that NVP-HSP990 treatment in GICs
disrupts cell-cycle control via the CDK2/CDK4 pathway by
regulating the protein degradation of these cell-cycle
regulators.
NVP-HSP990 is highly potent and selective for HSP90 and
represents one of the most potent oral HSP90 inhibitors
reported. NVP-HSP990 also displayed signiﬁcant HSP90-

dependent antitumor activity in glioma cell lines by interacting with HSP90 and leading to the destabilization and
degradation of several proteins that depend on HSP90 for
their stability (25, 26). Furthermore, NVP-HSP990 exhibited
promising drug selectivity on responder GICs, as IC50 values
of responder GIC lines is much less than those of astrocytes
or neural stem cells. NVP-HSP990 signiﬁcantly impaired GIC
proliferation and triggered neuronal differentiation of the
GICs, conﬁrming that HSP90 plays a role in maintaining
GICs biologic properties.
GICs cultured under neural stem cell conditions can
display heterogeneous biologic characteristics and lineage
proﬁles that reﬂect the heterogeneous features of GBMs (27).
Olig2, a bHLH transcription factor, shows both antineural
functions and proneural functions in oligodendrocyte progenitors (28, 29, 30). The responder GIC lines highly
expressed Olig2, whereas NVP-HSP990 treatment reduced
its expression, suggesting NVP-HSP990 might preferentially
target GICs that might originate from early neural progenitors such as oligodendrocyte progenitors. More importantly,
Olig2 might play a crucial role in promoting the proliferation
of neural stem/progenitor cells and malignant glioma. Ligon
and colleaguesindicated that Olig2-regulated lineagerestricted pathway controls replication competence in neural stem cells and malignant glioma (31). Recent study also

www.aacrjournals.org

showed that acquisition of Olig2 in the Id1high GICs population is a critical factor in its tumorigenic potential (32).
Consistently, we showed that Olig2 might regulate proliferation of GICs, as Olig2-high GICs exhibit higher Ki-67 index.
Knockdown of Olig2 slowed the GIC proliferation, whereas
overexpression of Olig2 promotes cell proliferation in Olig2low GICs. Therefore, Olig2 might be a functional marker in
maintaining the proliferative/rapid cycling state of GICs,
which might render them susceptible to drugs that disrupt
the cell-cycle progression.
Cell-cycle regulators are inserted in complex networks
whose alteration might underlie tumorigenesis in the nervous system (33). Accumulating evidence indicates that the
regulatory mechanisms in the G1 phase in neural precursors
play an important role in the precursors' decision to proliferate or differentiate and that factors modulating G1 might
be used to inﬂuence this decision (34). CDK2 and CDK4 are
the master regulators controlling G1–S progression, which
they do by phosphorylating the Rb protein. CDK2 is also
critical for the proliferation and self-renewal of neural
progenitor cells in the adult subventricular zone (35, 36).
In this study, we showed that CDK2 and CDK4 are complexed with HSP90 in GICs; NVP-HSP990 attenuates CDK2
and CDK4 protein levels, consequently decrease cell populations in the S-phase, and impair cell proliferation.

Furthermore, our data indeed showed that similar to NVPHSP990, Olig2-high GIC lines are more sensitive to CDK2/4
inhibitor ﬂavopiridol. Given the potential role of Olig2 as a
functional marker in maintaining the rapid cycling state of
GICs, disrupting cell-cycle regulation by targeting CDK2 and
CDK4 (NVP-HSP990 or ﬂavopiridol) might help to kill GICs
with high Olig2 expression.
The mechanism that regulates CDK2/4 and Olig2 function
is unknown. Our ﬁndings indicate that CDK2/4 can interact
with Olig2 in GICs. Nevertheless, CDK2/4 activities are
crucial to maintain Olig2 stability, as CDK2/4 inhibition by
Flavopiridol disrupts the CDK2/4/Olig2 interaction and
destabilize Olig2 protein. The above ﬁndings might implicate a mechanism through which HSP90 regulate cell
proliferation in Olig2-high GICs. Although the detailed
mechanisms still remains to be understood regarding how
CDK2/4 interacts with Olig2.

One challenge for molecular inhibitor development is the
selection of cancer patients who would beneﬁt from this
treatment. TCGA described a robust gene expression-based
molecular classiﬁcation of GBMs, with distinct gene expression proﬁles in GBM subclasses (37). Establishing the association between drug responses and GBM molecular subclasses
may help to identify potential cohorts of patients for targeted
therapy. In this study, we identiﬁed proneural gene Olig2 as a
functional marker to predict the GICs' response to NVPHSP990. These data suggest that NVP-HSP990 would be effective in targeting as well as eventually minimizing recurrence by
inhibiting the proliferation of GICs. Results of this study are
therefore anticipated to help identify potential GBM patient
cohorts who would gain the most from HSP90 inhibition and
could also be potentially valuable in designing future combinational strategy to target the subset of GICs with high Olig2
expression.

Retraction: Novel HSP90 Inhibitor NVP-HSP990
Targets Cell-Cycle Regulators to Ablate Olig
2-Positive Glioma Tumor–Initiating Cells

The authors wish to retract the article entitled "Novel HSP90 Inhibitor
NVP-HSP990 Targets Cell-Cycle Regulators to Ablate Olig 2-Positive Glioma
Tumor–Initiating Cells," which was published in the May 15, 2013 (73:3062)
issue of Cancer Research (1).
A University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center internal investigation has
found that Dr. Jun Fu committed research misconduct as deﬁned by 42 CFR Part
93 and MD Anderson's Research Misconduct Policy. Speciﬁcally, that Dr. Jun Fu
falsiﬁed the data appearing in Figure 8B by modifying the death dates of mouse
specimens to produce a fabricated survivability curve for GSC-11. Dr. Jun Fu has
accepted full responsibility for this breach of research integrity. This constitutes
a violation of MD Anderson policy concerning the ethical conduct of research, as
well as a signiﬁcant departure from the research practices commonly accepted
by MD Anderson research community. Because of the severity of this breach of
research integrity, the authors believe that retraction of the article represents
the most appropriate course of action to ensure the accuracy of the scientiﬁc
record.
The internal panel further concluded that none of the other co-authors of this article
knew, or had reason to suspect that the data presented in the article had been
manipulated by Dr. Jun Fu.
All co-authors have agreed to this retraction.
