BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of multidrug resistance genes that are associated with clinical outcome in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who were treated with preoperative gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy at M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center. METHODS: We selected 8 SNPs of 7 drug resistance genes, including MDR1 (ABCB1), MRP1-5 (ABCC1-5), and
BCRP (ABCG2), reported to be important in mediating drug resistance. Genotype was determined by the Taqman
method. The associations of genotype with tumor response to therapy and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using
log-rank test, Cox regression, and logistic regression models. RESULTS: MRP5 A-2G AA genotype showed significant
association with OS (log-rank P ¼ .010). The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) was 1.65 (1.11-2.45) after adjusting
for clinical predictors. The MRP2 G40A GG genotype had a weak association with reduced OS (log-rank P ¼ .097). A
combined effect of the two genotypes on OS was observed. Patients with none of the adverse genotypes had a median survival time (MST) of 34.0 months, and those with 1-2 deleterious alleles had a significantly lower MST of 20.7
months (log-rank P ¼ .006). MRP2 G40A GG genotype was also significantly associated with poor histological
response to chemoradiotherapy (P ¼ .028). CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest a potential role of polymorphic variants of drug resistance genes in predicting therapeutic efficacy and survival of patients with potentially reC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive human cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%,1 and
highly resistant to most therapies. Gemcitabine is the current standard of care for chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer, but
its efficacy is limited. Demonstrating the determinant of gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer has great clinical
implications.
Drug resistance, a major cause of treatment failure in oncology,2 consists of several processes (eg, increased drug
efflux and decreased accumulation of drugs in the cell).3 Efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family—
such as ABCB1 (multidrug resistance 1, MDR1), the ABCC (multidrug resistance-associated protein, MRP) family, and
ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP)—have been identified as major determinants of chemoresistance in tumor cells.4 Because of their ability to regulate the intracellular concentration and tissue distribution of xenobiotics and
their metabolites, ABC transporters are potentially important players in drug response.5
The MDR, MRP, and BCRP family has 11, 13, and 5 (or 6) members, respectively.5 The MDR1 gene product
P-glycoprotein is a membrane protein that functions as an ATP-dependent exporter of drugs from cells. Some studies
demonstrated a high rate of MDR1 expression in pancreatic cancer tissue and cell lines,6,7 and other studies reported that
MDR1 overexpression is associated with sensitivity to gemcitabine.8,9 MRP (ABCC) subfamily members differ in substrate specificity, tissue distribution, and cellular localization.10 MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 transport lipophilic compounds conjugated with glutathione, glucuronate, or sulfate. MRP4 and MRP5 transport nucleotide analogs and cyclic
nucleotides. In addition to endogenous compounds, MRPs are involved in exporting a variety of organic anions of

xenobiotics and are important in conferring resistance to
cytotoxic and antiviral drugs.10 It has been shown that
MRP1-MRP5 mRNAs were overexpressed in several pancreatic cancer cell lines.3
Despite many reports of SNPs in the ABC transporter family,10-15 the impact of polymorphisms on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for gemcitabine
remains to be defined. We hypothesized that genetic variation in drug resistance genes is associated with the clinical
response and overall prognosis of pancreatic cancer
patients treated with gemcitabine. We tested this hypothesis in a relatively homogeneous population of 154 patients
with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer who had
undergone neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemoradiation, with or without cisplatin induction therapy. For this
study, we evaluated 8 coding region SNPs with minor allele frequencies >0.10 of the MDR1, MRP1-5, and BCRP
genes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Recruitment and Data Collection
The study involved 154 patients who, at the time of diagnosis, had potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of
the pancreas head and had not received any treatment
for pancreatic cancer. All patients were enrolled in 1 of
2 phase II clinical trials (ID98-020 or ID01-341) of
preoperative, combined, chemoradiation therapy for
pancreatic cancer at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), conducted
sequentially from February 1999 to 2006.16,17 These
154 patients represented the subset of 176 patients enrolled in these clinical trials who had DNA samples for
genotyping. The study was approved by the institutional
review board of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Patients in the ID98-020 trial (n ¼ 70) had received
gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy consisting of
weekly gemcitabine (400 mg/m2) for 4 weeks and radiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions) for 2 weeks. Patients in the
ID01-341 trial (n ¼ 84) had received induction therapy
of gemcitabine (750 mg/m2/d) and cisplatin (30 mg/
m2/d) every 2 weeks for 4 weeks, followed by weekly
gemcitabine (400 mg/m2) for 4 weeks and radiation (30
Gy in 10 fractions) for 2 weeks. After chemoradiation,
patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy using
Whipple procedure.
Clinical information was collected retrospectively
from the patients’ medical records. Dates of death were
obtained and cross-checked using at least one of the fol-

times were calculated from the date of pathologic diagnosis to the date of death or last follow-up. Data for patients
who were alive at the last follow-up evaluation were censored at that time. Serum CA19-9 levels were measured at
the time of cancer diagnosis. Tumor size was estimated
from measurements made by endoscopic ultrasonography
(EUS) or computed tomography (CT) at the time of cancer diagnosis. Tumor differentiation was evaluated in
most surgically resected tumors and a few biopsy samples.
Tumor response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy was
evaluated by CT before and after treatment, and defined
according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors as partial response, stable disease, or progressive
disease. The histological effect of preoperative chemoradiotherapy was evaluated in resected tumors according to
previously published criteria18; ie, tumors with >90%
viable cancer cells were defined as treatment effect grade I,
51%-90% viable cells as grade IIA, 10%-50% viable cells
as grade IIB, and <10% viable cells as grade III. Neither
postsurgical treatment nor treatment received after tumor
recurrence was considered in this study because of their
minimal effect on overall survival.

DNA Extraction and Genotyping
We selected 8 SNPs of the MDR1, MRP1-5, and BCRP
genes according to the following criteria: 1) minor allele
frequency of the SNP was greater than 10% among Caucasians, 2) coding SNPs including nonsynonymous or
synonymous SNPs, and 3) SNPs that have been associated
with cancer risk or clinical outcome in prior studies.
Table 1 summarizes the genes, chromosome locations,
nucleotide substitutions, amino acid changes, reference
SNP identification numbers, and minor allele frequencies
of the 8 SNPs evaluated in this study.
Whole blood was collected from patients at the time
of clinical trial enrollment, and DNA was extracted from
peripheral-blood lymphocytes of 127 patients and from
paraffin sections of normal adjacent tissues of 27 patients
with resected tumors (20 from the ID98-020 trial), using
a DNA isolation kit from Qiagen Inc., (Valencia, CA).
Polymorphisms were detected using the TaqMan genotyping assays provided by Applied Biosystems (Foster
City, CA). In duplicate analysis, discrepancies were seen
in less than 1% of total samples. Discordant results were
resolved by further genotyping analysis.

The data observed in current study.

The reported minor allele frequency (Caucasian) was from SNP500 cancer database.

Statistical Methods
The distribution of genotypes was tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using the goodness-of-fit chi-square test.
The association of clinical factors and genotypes with OS
was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method and the logrank test. The median follow-up time was computed with
censored observations only. Median survival time (MST)
was calculated using data from all patients. The heterozygous and homozygous genotypes were combined in these
analyses if the frequency of the homozygous mutant was
low or if the homozygous and heterozygous genotypes
had the same effect on survival or tumor response. Hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression models. Significant clinicopathologic factors on OS by log-rank test were included
in the multivariate model when appropriate. Chi-square
test and logistic regression were used to evaluate the association of genotypes with tumor response. All statistical
testing was conducted with SPSS software, version 17.0
(SPSS, Chicago, IL). Statistical significance was defined as
P <.05 and borderline significance as P <.10.
We estimated the false-positive report probability
(FPRP) for the observed, statistically significant associations using the methods described by Wacholder et al.19
The prior probability employed was .25 and the FPRP
value for noteworthiness was set at .2.

RESULTS
Patients’ Characteristics and Survival Analysis
The patients’ characteristics and clinical features of their
tumors are summarized in Table 2. The median age of the
154 patients in this study was 62.8 years (range, 38-80
years). There were 111 deaths (72%) among 154 cases,
and the MST was 21.7 months (95% CI, 17.5 to 25.9).

746

The median follow-up time was 63.1 months for the living patients at the end of July 2008. After preoperative
chemoradiotherapy, 116 patients underwent grossly completed surgical resection of the primary tumor. However,
7 resections among them turned out to be microscopically
margin positive (R1 resection). The remaining 38 patients
could not undergo resection because of disease progression. Diabetes, tumor size larger than 2.0 cm, a higher serum level of CA19-9 at diagnosis, progressive disease on
tumor response, no resection, poor differentiation, lymph
node metastasis, and ID01-341 trial were factors significantly associated with reduced OS (Table 2).
Genotype Frequency and Association With OS
Eight SNPs of interest were successfully amplified in
95.5%-100% of the samples. Genotype frequencies of all
8 SNPs were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(chi-square ¼ 0.0003-3.78; P >.05). No significant racial
difference in genotype frequency was observed (data not
shown).
The genotype frequencies, MSTs, and hazard ratios
(95% CI) are shown in Table 3. Two SNPs, MRP5 A-2G
and MRP2 G40A, showed a significant or borderline significant association with OS in log-rank test (P ¼ .010
and.097, respectively). The HRs (95% CI) of MRP5
A-2G and MRP2 G40A were 1.65 (1.11-2.45) and 1.55
(1.02-2.36). The MSTs of MRP5 A-2G AG/GG and AA
genotype were 28.1 and 18.4 months, respectively. In
addition, a combined genotype effect of MRP5 A-2G and
MRP2 G40A was observed. As the number of at-risk
alleles increased, the OS decreased: patients carrying 0
(n ¼ 39) or 1-2 (n ¼ 7112) at-risk alleles had median OS
times of 34.0 and 20.7 months (P ¼ .006, Table 3), as
well as 5-year survival rates of 41.3% and 20.0% in the
Kaplan-Meier plot (Fig. 1).

Genotype Effects on Response to Therapy
None of the genotypes was associated with tumor
response in radiological evaluation (data not shown). However, the MRP2 G40A GG genotype, which was associated
with a reduced survival, had a significant association with
poor response to therapy in histological evaluation of the
resected tumor (P ¼ .028, Table 5). Thirty (47.6%) of the
MRP2 40 GG carriers, compared with 13 (27.1%) of the
AG/AA carriers, had a grade I or IIA response; ie, >50% of
tumor cells were viable in the resected tumor. The odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.45 (1.09-5.48).

noma. We demonstrated that the genotypes of MRP5 A2G and MRP2 G40A had a significant association with
OS. The MRP2 G40A GG genotype carriers also had a
poorer histological response to preoperative gemcitabinebased chemoradiotherapy. These observations support a
role of drug resistance-associated genes in cellular sensitivity to gemcitabine-based therapy and, as the result, survival of pancreatic cancer patients.
It has been shown that nucleotide analogs and cyclic
nucleotides are substrates for MRP5 and MRP4,20 and,
particularly, gemcitabine was reported to be a typical substrate for the MRP5 efflux pump.21 One study showed a
significant association between expression level of MRP5
and gemcitabine sensitivity in a non-small cell lung cancer
cell line.22 Another study demonstrated that HEK293
cells overexpressing the human MRP5 protein are twice as
resistant to gemcitabine, compared with vector control
cells.21 Because this study population received preoperative chemoradiotherapy, we did not think it appropriate
to examine the gene expression profiles in resected
tumors. However, a previous study has shown that MRP5
mRNA level was significantly higher in pancreatic carcinoma tissue versus normal pancreatic tissue,3 suggesting
that overexpression of MRP5 could contribute to drug resistance in pancreatic cancer. Although many SNPs of the
MRP5 gene have been reported,23 the functional significance of the vast majority of these SNPs is still unclear.24
MRP5 A-2G (Q382Q) is a synonymous SNP that does
not produce altered coding sequences or amino acid substitution. However, a previous study has demonstrated
that a synonymous SNP in the MDR1 gene results in a
protein product with altered drug and inhibitor interactions.25 Thus, the functional consequence of this SNP
warrants investigation. It is also possible that this SNP is
in linkage disequilibrium with other functional SNPs of

chromosome location. Further investigations, including
haplotype analysis, will help to determine how this SNP is
functionally associated with gemcitabine sensitivity and
survival in pancreatic cancer patients.
MRP2 is reported to be involved in exporting not
only bilirubin and certain drug glucuronides, but also anticancer drugs.4 This includes cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, and methotrexate.26,27 We observed that MRP2
G40A genotype has a relatively weak association with survival and tumor response to gemcitabine therapy in the
entire study population. However, this association diminished when the 84 patients receiving cisplatin induction
therapy were analyzed separately (data not shown). Gemcitabine is not thought to be a typical substrate of MRP2.28
Therefore, MRP2 might play an indirect role in sensitivity
to gemcitabine and cisplatin combination therapy.
Although MDR1 T-55C and BCRP C43A were
reported to be functional SNPs that change their protein
functions,25,29 none of these SNPs—nor the MRP1, MRP3,
or MRP4 gene SNPs examined in this study—had any association with overall survival or tumor response to therapy.
This suggests that these genes are probably not the most important determinants in cellular response to gemcitabinebased chemoradiotherapy. However, it is also possible that
the limited number of SNPs selected for this study missed
the most important functional variants of these genes. Further investigation is required to illustrate how these genes
may affect the clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer.
In the same study population, we have previously
shown significant associations of SNPs of DNA homolog
recombination repair genes,30 DNA damage response
genes,31 DNA mismatch repair genes,32 and gemcitabine
metabolic genes33 with clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer. The current study has identified another important
genetic factor, one that is associated with drug sensitivity
and patient survival. Our results need to be confirmed in
other study populations. The ultimate goal of this research
is to generate a genetic profile that can be used to predict
response to preoperative gemcitabine-based therapy as well
as predict prognosis in patients with potentially resectable
pancreatic cancer. If the genetic markers are established and
validated, they may help with choice of therapy and patient
stratification in future individualized cancer treatment.
