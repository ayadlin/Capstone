ABSTRACT
Newer and more potent therapies are urgently needed to effectively treat
advanced cancers that have developed resistance and metastasized. One such strategy
is to target cancer cell iron metabolism, which is altered compared to normal cells
and may facilitate their rapid proliferation. This is supported by studies reporting the
anti-neoplastic activities of the clinically available iron chelators, desferrioxamine
and deferasirox. More recently, ligands of the di-2-pyridylketone thiosemicarbazone
(DpT) class have demonstrated potent and selective anti-proliferative activity across
multiple cancer-types in vivo, fueling studies aimed at dissecting their molecular
mechanisms of action. In the past five years alone, significant advances have been
made in understanding how chelators not only modulate cellular iron metabolism,
but also multiple signaling pathways implicated in tumor progression and metastasis.
Herein, we discuss recent research on the targeting of iron in cancer cells, with a
focus on the novel and potent DpT ligands. Several key studies have revealed that
iron chelation can target the AKT, ERK, JNK, p38, STAT3, TGF-β, Wnt and autophagic
pathways to subsequently inhibit cellular proliferation, the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and metastasis. These developments emphasize that these novel
therapies could be utilized clinically to effectively target cancer.

cells in order to identify cancer-specific molecular
targets. This need has generated the basis for the
development of the next generation of chemotherapeutics,
e.g., trastuzumab, erlotinib, etc., that have entered the
clinics in the past decade and target key cell signaling
pathways and effectors that are deregulated in cancers
[3]. However, better therapies are still urgently needed to
effectively treat more aggressive tumors, particularly those
that have developed resistance and metastasized. One such
strategy is to target cellular iron metabolism that is known
to be markedly altered in cancer cells [4–7].
Considering that most cancers are characterized
by the deregulation of multiple genes and pathways,
therapeutics that can target multiple molecular signaling
effectors present as promising strategies for the successful
treatment of cancer. Herein, we review recent research on
the targeting of iron for cancer therapy, with emphasis on

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is estimated to have claimed the lives of
more than 8 million individuals in 2012 and remains
a leading cause of death worldwide [1]. Increased
knowledge concerning the etiology, pathobiology and
treatment of cancer has meant that some patients now
have a high chance of cure. However, despite promising
advances in the treatment of some cancer-types, others
continue to retain dismal survival rates, such as pancreatic
cancer, which has usually metastasized at the time of
diagnosis and is virtually impossible to cure [2].
Although many conventional chemotherapeutics
extend lives, more potent and specific therapies are
required to combat advanced disease. Recent advances in
cancer research have been driven by a call to understand
the molecular differences between normal and neoplastic

We will discuss recent advances in understanding how
these potent compounds not only target cellular iron, but
also multiple signaling pathways that are implicated in
tumor progression and metastasis, and how they may be
integrated into the current landscape of molecular targeted
therapies for cancer treatment. These and continuing
developments will help to facilitate the translation of
these novel therapies as a potential multi-focal strategy
for cancer treatment.

to its ferrous form, at least in erythroid cells, by the
ferrireductase, six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of
the prostate 3 (STEAP3; Figure 1A) [18]. The iron can
then be released across the endosomal membrane into
the cytosol via the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1)
[19] into the labile iron pool, a poorly characterized
compartment where iron is proposed to complex with low
molecular weight ligands, e.g., citrate, ATP, sugars, etc.
[20,  21]. However, evidence for a low molecular weight
pool of cellular iron in rapidly metabolizing cells was
never substantiated [22]. In fact, more recently, cellular
iron chaperones have been well characterized, i.e., human
poly (rC)-binding proteins (i.e., PCBP1–4), which mediate
the delivery of iron to ferritin and cytosolic non-heme
iron-containing enzymes, i.e., dioxygenases [23–25].
Cellular iron is utilized in multiple homeostatic
processes. For instance, it can be: (i) incorporated into
the active sites of proteins, e.g., ribonucleotide reductase
(RR); (ii) stored in cytoplasmic ferritin; (iii) distributed
to the mitochondria for heme synthesis, iron-sulfur
cluster generation, or storage in mitochondrial ferritin;
or (iv) exported out of the cell via the iron efflux pump,
ferroportin 1 (Fpn1; Figure 1A) [5, 26]. Iron homeostasis
is achieved, at least in part, by the iron-regulatory proteins
(IRPs), which respond to intracellular iron concentrations
and control protein expression at the post-transcriptional
level, thereby regulating the uptake, usage and storage of
iron [27, 28].

IRON AND CANCER
An excess of iron in the body is toxic due to its
ability to engage in redox cycling and promote free
radical formation [4]. Iron via the Fenton reaction can
exacerbate the consequences of hydrogen peroxide
production, leading to the generation of hydroxyl radicals,
the most reactive chemical species in biological systems
(Equation 1) [8, 9]. The superoxide ion can also participate
in regenerating ferrous iron that is required for the Fenton
reaction (Equation 2) [10].
(1)
(2)
These free radicals can instigate a series of chemical
reactions, leading to DNA oxidation, mitochondrial
damage and the peroxidation of membrane lipids, thereby
initiating DNA damage, adversely affecting cell cycle
progression and promoting cell apoptosis [8]. Therefore,
it is crucial that iron levels are tightly regulated in the
body via specialized proteins and processes responsible
for transporting and storing iron in a soluble and nontoxic form [11]. Failure to maintain iron homeostasis
in the body is associated with numerous disease states,
including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus,
infections and neuro-degenerative disorders [5].

Altered iron metabolism in cancer cells
Deregulation of iron homeostasis in cancer cells
compared to normal cells has been widely reported
[5, 7]. These altered iron states in malignancies can occur
through changes in iron uptake, efflux and storage, which
may confer an increased iron acquisition phenotype by
cancer cells to mediate their rapid proliferation [5, 29].
Iron uptake

Iron metabolism

Numerous studies have demonstrated that cancer
cells have higher TfR1 levels compared to normal cells,
and that higher TfR1 expression is correlated with more
advanced cancers [5, 30–32]. This reflects the higher rate
of iron uptake from transferrin seen in cancer cells [33].
Furthermore, antibodies against TfR1 have been shown
to inhibit tumor growth [34]. The rate limiting enzyme
required for DNA synthesis requires a continual supply of
iron for its assembly and activity and is also up-regulated
in cancer [35]. Hence, the rates of proliferation and DNA
synthesis are increased in cancer cells relative to normal
cells [35].
Iron uptake is also facilitated by the endosomal
metalloreductase, STEAP3, which may reduce endosomal
ferric iron bound to transferrin to its ferrous form in
erythroid cells [18]. In fact, STEAP has been reported
to be overexpressed in prostate, colorectal, lung, and

Iron from dietary sources is absorbed within the
small intestine and is then transported from the duodenal
enterocyte into the blood, where it binds to the iron-binding
protein, transferrin [11–13]. Transferrin is present in
physiological fluids, with each transferrin molecule able to
bind two atoms of ferric iron with high affinity [14–16].
Transferrin plays a critical role in transporting bound iron
from sites of absorption and heme degradation (i.e., the
intestine and liver, respectively) to cells for critical functions
such as erythropoiesis and storage in ferritin. The transferrin
receptor 1 (TfR1) protein, which is present on the plasma
membrane, is able to bind two transferrin molecules to
facilitate iron uptake by cells [11, 14, 17].
The transferrin-TfR1 complex is then internalized
into the endosome, where the ferric iron is released from
transferrin due to the acidic environment and reduced

Figure 1: A. Cellular iron metabolism. Two atoms of ferric iron bind to transferrin (Tf) proteins present in the circulation to form
the iron-saturated form of Tf (holo-Tf). Two molecules of holo-Tf can then bind to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expressed at the cell
membrane. The Tf-TfR1 complex undergoes endocytosis and is internalized into the endosome, inducing the release of Tf-bound ferric iron
and reduction to its ferrous form by six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (STEAP3). Iron is then released into the cytosol
via the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) into the labile iron pool, where it can be: (i) incorporated into the active sites of proteins, such
as ribonucleotide reductase; (ii) stored as cytoplasmic ferritin; (iii) utilized by the mitochondria; and (iv) exported out of the cell via the
iron efflux pump, ferroportin 1 (Fpn1). The iron-deficient form of Tf (apo-Tf) and TfR1 molecules are subsequently recycled and returned

IRON CHELATORS: FROM IRON
OVERLOAD DISEASES TO CANCER
TREATMENT

pancreatic cancers, amongst others [36, 37], indicating
another aspect of altered iron metabolism that may be
linked with cancer.
Iron efflux

Clinically approved iron chelators

Studies have reported that the expression of the
iron efflux pump, Fpn1, is decreased or absent in breast
cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and
leukemia, although these changes were not seen in brain
or esophageal cancers [38–40]. Pinnix et al. [39] noted
that reduction in Fpn1 levels occurred concomitantly with
increased levels of the peptide hormone, hepcidin, which
negatively regulates Fpn1 expression by promoting its
internalization and degradation [41]. Moreover, decreased
Fpn1 expression in breast cancer patients was correlated
with poor prognosis and metastasis, independent of other
risk factors, and was proposed as a prognostic marker for
this disease [39], indicating potentially important roles for
the Fpn1-hepcidin regulatory axis in oncogenic signaling.
Iron in cells can also be released via the action
of the signaling molecule, nitric oxide (NO) [42, 43].
Interestingly, NO can directly bind iron and affect a
variety of intracellular proteins and metabolic pathways
[11, 44–47]. Furthermore, NO generated either
intracellularly (via inducible nitric oxide synthase; iNOS)
or extracellularly has been shown to result in marked
release of iron from cells [48, 49]. In fact, in contrast
to the mechanism of cellular iron release mediated by
Fpn1 described above, NO-dependent iron release has
been demonstrated to occur via the multi-drug resistance
protein 1 (MRP1) [49, 50].

Iron chelation therapy was initially designed to
prevent iron-mediated toxicity in iron overload diseases
such as β-thalassemia [57]. In β-thalassemia, ineffective
hemoglobin synthesis necessitates repeated blood
transfusions to reverse the anemic state, and together
with iron absorption from the gut, this leads to iron
overload, resulting in potentially fatal tissue damage [58].
Sequestering iron from cells relieves the iron burden,
thereby leading to the effective treatment of the iron
overload associated with β-thalassemia therapy [58, 59].
Desferrioxamine (DFO), or Desferal®, is a hexadentate
chelator isolated from the bacteria Streptomyces pilosus, and
binds iron in a 1:1 ratio [60] (Figure 1B). It is currently
the “gold standard” chelator used for the treatment of
β-thalassemia [61]. However, due to its hydrophilicity
and short plasma half-life, it requires administration by
long subcutaneous infusion for periods of 8–12 hours [62].
This cumbersome and expensive method, along with pain
and swelling at the injection site, has led to poor patient
compliance [63], and the need to develop orally-active
chelators.
The potential of iron chelators for the treatment
of cancer first came to light in studies assessing the
effect of DFO and other iron chelators on leukemia
cells in culture and also in leukemia patients [64, 65].
This was subsequently followed by studies examining
neuroblastoma tumor cells [66, 67] and then clinical
trials in neuroblastoma patients, which showed promising
results [68]. In these early studies, DFO administered in
combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, such as
cyclophosphamide, etoposide and carboplatin, resulted in
50 out of 57 patients showing partial to complete positive
responses [69]. However, the reported anti-tumor activity
of DFO has been inconsistent, with a number of studies
failing to demonstrate marked anti-tumor effects [70, 71].
This observation is likely due to the short half-life and
poor membrane permeability of this compound that
markedly limits its iron chelation efficacy and anti-tumor
activity [4, 72, 73].
Many synthetic iron chelators have since been
designed in attempts to increase efficacy, reduce toxicity
and side effects, and improve oral activity [4]. More
recently, the ligand 4-[3, 5-bis-(hydroxyphenyl)-1, 2,
4-triazol-1-yl]-benzoic acid (deferasirox) was successful
in clinical trials in iron-loaded patients and released by
Novartis as EXJADE® for the treatment of β-thalassemia
as a relatively lipophilic, orally active alternative to DFO
[74] (Figure 1B). Data from phase II and III trials showed
that the efficacy of deferasirox was comparable to that
of DFO in transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia patients

Iron storage
Studies in the literature also indicate that the
regulation of iron storage is altered in tumors [5].
Assessment of ferritin expression levels in cancer cells
and patient tissues have yielded conflicting conclusions,
with some studies reporting up-regulation of ferritin [51],
while others showing down-regulation of ferritin [5, 39].
Elevated serum ferritin levels have been observed in
primary lung cancer [52], advanced stage C colorectal
cancer [53], and neuroblastoma patients [54], which were
all correlated with poorer survival rates or prognoses.
Interestingly, ferritin expression was reportedly
decreased by the proto-oncogene, c-myc, which often has
increased expression in human malignancies, allowing
an increased availability of free iron for DNA synthesis
and cell growth [55]. In addition, Kakhlon et al. [56]
showed that HRAS-induced down-regulation of ferritin
was sufficient to increase the labile iron pool and stimulate
proliferation. Thus, aberrations in ferritin levels may
facilitate tumor progression.
These alterations of iron metabolism in cancer
demonstrate the potential for therapeutic manipulation by
iron-binding ligands. In the past few decades, this has led
to the discovery and development of iron chelators with
anti-tumor activity [5].

[75,  76]. However, deferasirox appears to be better
tolerated than DFO in both adults and children [76], and
the number of serious adverse events has been relatively
low [77].
In recent years, there has been growing interest
in the potential of deferasirox as a potential anti-tumor
agent, given that it is already clinically approved, well
tolerated, and is orally administered [74]. Deferasirox
has been reported to inhibit the growth of hepatoma,
myeloid leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma cells
[78–81]. It has also recently been demonstrated that
deferasirox significantly inhibited the growth of DMS53 lung tumor and esophageal (OE33, OE19, and OE21)
tumor xenografts grown in mice, with no marked effects
on biochemical and hematological indices [82, 83].
Interestingly, in a patient suffering chemotherapy-resistant
acute monocytic leukemia, administration of deferasirox
demonstrated a remarkable anti-leukemic effect resulting
in complete remission [84]. Collectively, these studies
suggest that deferasirox is a candidate chelator for
chemotherapy, but further extensive studies are required
to validate its clinical application.

marked anti-proliferative activity and greater iron
chelation efficacy compared to DFO [90, 91, 103].
This anti-proliferative effect was found to be due to the
ability of 311 to deplete cellular iron pools required for
RR activity and other processes, as well as to affect the
expression of molecules regulating cell cycle progression
[94, 103, 104].
Further structure-activity studies of aroylhydrazones,
such as the PKIH analogues (Figure 1B) [92], and
novel
aroylhydrazone/thiosemicarbazone
hybrid
ligands [93], led to the identification of key structural
characteristics important for iron chelating efficacy and
potent anti-proliferative activity. From this analysis
emerged the development of the di-2-pyridylketone
thiosemicarbazone (DpT) series of iron chelators,
of
which
di-2-pyridylketone-4,
4-dimethyl-3thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT; Figure 1B) showed far
more potent chelating efficacy and anti-proliferative
activity than both DFO and 311 [105]. This activity was
demonstrated in vitro in SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma,
SK-Mel-28 melanoma and MCF-7 breast cancer cells,
as well as in vivo using cytotoxic drug-resistant, M109
mouse lung carcinoma tumors [105]. In these studies, the
specifically synthesized DpT analogue, di-2-pyridylketone
2-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp2mT; Figure 1B),
which cannot bind metals, had no significant effect on
proliferation [105]. This observation demonstrated that
the potent activity of the DpT series was due to its ability
to specifically interact with metal ions. Comparison of
the activities of Dp44mT with Triapine® both in vitro and
in vivo showed that Dp44mT displayed markedly and
significantly greater anti-tumor activity across a range of
28 tumor cell lines, including etoposide- and vinblastineresistant cells, indicating it could overcome resistance to
other anti-tumor agents [106]. In mouse xenograft studies,
Dp44mT was also more potent and effective at inhibiting
tumor growth than Triapine® and was less toxic [106].
The potent anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects
of Dp44mT have also been demonstrated in other studies
in vivo using breast [107] and hepatocellular carcinoma
cells [108]. Further, Dp44mT was shown to induce
apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, where decreased
Bcl-2 and increased Bax expression was observed with
holo-cytochrome c release and caspase activation
[105, 109, 110]. This indicated important roles for the
mitochondria in mediating the molecular events that lead
to chelator-induced cell death.
Attempts to further elucidate the potent antiproliferative effects of Dp44mT revealed two important
properties, namely: (1) that it had a high lipophilicity
compared to DFO, enabling it to easily permeate cell
membranes; and (2) that the iron complex had an
appropriate redox potential to facilitate redox activity
which could lead to cytotoxicity [111]. Moreover,
Dp44mT was shown to enter the lysosome and become
trapped due to its ionization properties and the acidic pH

Thiosemicarbazone chelators
In recent years, the development of more active
chelators for cancer treatment has included a range
of ligands [4, 6, 85, 86]. These compounds include:
3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone
(3-AP; Triapine®; Figure 1B) [87], Tachypyridine
[88], O-Trensox [89] and novel chelators derived from
pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH; Figure 1B)
[90, 91], di-2-pyridylketone isonicotinoyl hydrazone
(PKIH; Figure 1B) [92] and hybrid ligands derived from
aroylhydrazones and thiosemicarbazones [93]. To date,
3-AP (Triapine®) is the only other well characterized
ligand [94] besides DFO that has reached phase I and
II clinical trials specifically for the treatment of cancer
[95, 96]. Administered to patients either alone or in
combination with other chemotherapeutics, Triapine®
could successfully reduce white blood cell counts by
more than 50% in leukemia patients [97]. However,
clinical trials using Triapine® have also reported a
number of unwanted side effects including: anemia,
thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, methemoglobinemia [98],
neutropenia, hypoxia, hypotension, fatigue, nausea and
vomiting [99]. The success of Triapine® in clinical trials
has been further limited by the general lack of efficacy
and failure of patients to respond, resulting in termination
of studies before completion [100–102]. New classes
of ligands have since been developed in attempts to
overcome these negative effects and improve the potency
of these anti-cancer agents.
Studies examining a range of PIH analogues
demonstrated
that

of this organelle [110]. Subsequently, Dp44mT binds iron
and copper to form redox-active complexes that generate
cytotoxic ROS, enabling permeabilization of the lysosomal
membrane and induction of apoptosis [110]. More
recently, it was demonstrated that Dp44mT is a substrate
of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) that is also found on lysosomal
membranes, and thus, mediating lysosomal trapping of
Dp44mT and enhancing cytotoxicity in multidrug-resistant
cells [112]. This finding revealed a novel mechanism by
which Dp44mT could overcome multidrug-resistance
involving the ‘hijacking’ of the lysosomal-Pgp transport
system that normally mediates resistance [112].
The observation that high, non-optimal intravenous
doses of Dp44mT resulted in cardiac fibrosis in nude
mice [106] led to the development of the second
generation of DpT analogues [5, 109, 113]. Of this
series, di-2-pyridylketone 4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3thiosemicarbazone (DpC; Figure 1B) is the lead compound
that is currently undergoing clinical development through
Oncochel Therapeutics LLC (San Francisco, CA).
Significantly, DpC has demonstrated marked and selective
anti-neoplastic activity when administered orally or
intravenously, without inducing the cardiotoxicity of
Dp44mT [109, 113]. Moreover, DpC was more effective
than Dp44mT at inhibiting the growth of PANC-1
pancreatic tumor xenografts in vivo [109]. Elucidation
of the molecular effects of Dp44mT and DpC is ongoing
and critical for understanding their potent mechanism
of action.
Recent advances in our knowledge of how iron
chelators can modulate key cellular signaling pathways
deregulated in cancer will be discussed in the next
sections. In general, and where suitable comparisons
can be drawn, these studies have demonstrated that
iron chelators of different classes can modulate these
signaling pathways in a similar manner, indicating that the
underlying iron-binding activities of these compounds are
important for their observed molecular effects. Differences
in the properties of chelators, such as the ability of DpT
chelators to generate cytotoxic ROS, may play additional
roles in modulating these pathways, and are discussed in
the relevant sections.

cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), retinoblastoma
protein (Rb), p53, p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1, N-myc downstream
regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), and apoptotic proteins
[104, 114].
Ribonucleotide reductase
RR is an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the
synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA
replication, the rate limiting step of DNA synthesis, cell
cycle progression and cellular repair [115]. Human RR
consists of two homodimers, namely, R1, which contains
the active site and binding site for allosteric modulators,
and R2, which contains a di-nuclear iron center and stable
tyrosyl radical per monomer crucial for enzymatic activity
[116]. Furthermore, while the R2 subunit is necessary for
normal DNA synthesis during the S/G2 phase of the cell
cycle, a variant of the R2 subunit, the p53R2 subunit is
known to supply dNTPs for DNA repair following DNA
damage in a p53-dependent manner in G0/G1 phase cells
[117]. Both the R2 and p53R2 subunits possess an ironbinding site that is critical for their enzymatic function and
iron chelation is known to inhibit the activity of RR [118].
Considering increased RR activity has been associated with
malignant transformation and cancer cell growth [119], the
ability of iron chelators to inhibit its activity is likely to be
important for their anti-cancer effects (Figure 2).
Cyclins and CDKs
Iron depletion by chelators has been shown to
affect the expression of a number of cyclins and CDKs
[104]. Iron chelation in SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells
reduced expression of cyclins D1, D2 and D3, and to a
lesser extent, cyclins A and B [104]. Inhibition of cyclin
D1 expression by DFO and DpT chelators has been
demonstrated in prostate and pancreatic cancer cells [120,
121], and by deferasirox in DMS-53 lung carcinoma cells
[82] and mantle cell lymphoma cells [80]. This latter study
also demonstrated deferasirox-mediated down-regulation
of phosphorylated Rb (pRb), resulting in increased
levels of the E2F/Rb complex and G1/S phase cell cycle
arrest (Figure 2) [80]. Studies have also shown that iron
chelators can decrease expression of CDK2 or CDK4,
although this appears to occur in a cell-type-dependent
manner and varies under different experimental conditions
[94, 104, 122] (Figure 2).

MODULATION OF CELLULAR
SIGNALING PATHWAYS BY IRON
CHELATORS

p53
Iron chelation using DFO has been reported to
­ p-regulate expression of the tumor suppressor, p53, at
u
the post-transcriptional level [123]. Importantly, p53 has
a critical role at the G1/S checkpoint and is activated in
conditions of cell stress or DNA damage to either initiate
repair mechanisms or induce apoptosis if damage is
irreparable [124]. Incubation of cells with the chelators,
DFO and 311, has also been shown to increase nuclear p53
protein and p53 DNA-binding activity (Figure 2) [125].

The cell cycle
It is now clear that the anti-proliferative effects
of the novel chelators discussed above are due not only
to their ability to bind iron, but also to their complex
effects on multiple intracellular targets. Iron chelators are
known to target multiple molecules which are critical in
regulating progression of the cell cycle, including RR,

Figure 2: Iron chelation modulates multiple regulators of the cell cycle. Regulation of cell cycle progression is mediated by the
integration of multiple cues from upstream signal transduction pathways. Iron chelation has been demonstrated to modulate the activities of
ribonucleotide reductase (RR), cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, CDK inhibitors, and other cell cycle regulators including
p53 and c-myc (see text for more detail). Molecules known to be negatively regulated by iron chelators are indicated by red boxes, while
molecules known to be positively regulated by iron chelators are indicated by green boxes.

More recent studies have suggested that iron regulates p53
activity through direct interactions between heme and the
p53 protein, which triggers nuclear export and cytosolic
degradation of p53 [126]. Clearly, this latter effect is
opposite to that observed after iron depletion and occurs
when cells are iron replete.

the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein [130]. MCF-7 cells
have abnormally high levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression,
which probably provides these cells with a survival
advantage by allowing suppression of apoptosis [131].
Therefore, post-transcriptional regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1
by DFO and 311 confers a mechanism by which these
chelators inhibit the proliferation of cells which overexpress p21WAF1/CIP1 [130]. Incubating other cell-types,
namely DMS-53 lung carcinoma and SK-N-MC cells,
with the iron chelators DFO, Dp44mT, or deferasirox,
increased p21WAF1/CIP1 expression, which would likely
contribute to the anti-tumor activities of these latter two
compounds in vitro and in vivo [82].

CDK inhibitors
The CDK inhibitor, p21WAF1/CIP1, negatively regulates
the cell cycle by binding to G1/S phase CDK-cyclin
complexes, rendering them inactive [127]. This allows Rb
to bind E2F1, thereby preventing the G1/S phase transition
and causing cell cycle arrest. However, p21WAF1/CIP1
expression is required at low levels for the formation
of cyclin D/CDK complexes [128], and it has also been
shown to inhibit doxorubicin-induced apoptosis through
repressing caspase-3 activation [129]. Iron chelation using
DFO and 311 in MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells has
been shown to up-regulate p21 mRNA, while decreasing

transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), transforming growth factor-β
(TGF-β), Wnt and signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) pathways [133, 134]. In fact,
induction of c-myc proto-oncogene expression is required
for a robust cell cycle response to mitogenic signals [135].
This likely occurs through its ability to positively regulate
cyclin D/CDK4/6 activity and repress transcription of
p21WAF1/CIP1 [136, 137]. Iron chelation using DFO has been
shown to decrease c-myc expression in leukemic blood
cells [138]. Further, the chelators, DFO, Dp44mT and
DpC, have been recently demonstrated to reduce c-myc
levels in pancreatic and prostate cancer cells (Figure 2)
[121]. The mechanism mediated by these agents could at
least partially involve inhibition of the STAT3 pathway
and subsequent expression of its downstream targets,
including cyclin D1, c-myc, and Bcl-2 (discussed in
further detail below) [121].

NDRG1 at Ser342, Ser352 and Ser362 [149]. The ligands, DFO
and Dp44mT, can increase expression of phosphorylated
NDRG1 [109, 120]. However, the functional implications
of NDRG1 phosphorylation have not been extensively
explored in the literature and remain largely unclear.
Recent studies by Murakami et al. [150] have suggested
that in the human pancreatic cancer cell line, MIAPaCa-2,
phosphorylation of NDRG1 at Ser330 and Thr346 is essential
for its tumor-suppressive action on CXC chemokine
expression and the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer
of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Further,
phosphorylated NDRG1 was found to be localized to
centromeres and the cleavage furrow in dividing cells,
implying roles for this protein in microtubule organization,
the cell cycle and mitosis [151]. Of interest, recent studies
demonstrated that NDRG1 is proteolytically cleaved at
the N-terminus in the prostate cancer cell lines DU145,
PC3 and LNCaP, but not in normal prostate epithelial
cells [152]. This observation suggests that truncation of
NDRG1 in cancer cells could abrogate its tumor growth
and metastasis suppressive function.
Significant advances have been made in recent
years in terms of dissecting the molecular mechanism by
which NDRG1 exerts its tumor growth and metastasis
suppressive activities (reviewed in [153, 154]).
Importantly, NDRG1 alters the expression of a variety
of transcription factors and genes involved in ribosome
and protein synthesis and reduces the expression of
cathepsin C, a molecule which has roles in invasion, in
pancreatic cancer [147]. Additionally, whole genome gene
array analysis revealed NDRG1 up-regulates thiamine
triphosphatase (Thtpa) expression, which decreases
levels of thiamine triphosphate that is required for cellular
energy metabolism [147].
NDRG1 also up-regulates the CDK inhibitor,
p21WAF1/CIP1, which may mediate its anti-tumor effects
[155]. Further important roles for NDRG1 in the
regulation of multiple key cell signaling pathways (e.g.,
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT, MAPK
and TGF-β pathways) which affect the epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis have also
been identified [107, 109, 120, 156, 157]. These roles have
been implicated in mediating, in part, the anti-tumor and
anti-metastatic activities of the potent thiosemicarbazones,
Dp44mT or DpC, due to the ability of these compounds to
markedly up-regulate NDRG1 [107, 109, 120, 156, 157].
These findings will be discussed in further detail in the
relevant upcoming sections.

N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1)
NDRG1 (also known as differentiation related
gene 1 or Cap-43) is a metastasis suppressor gene
that encodes a protein with a range of significant cell
functions including cell cycle regulation, differentiation,
angiogenesis, maintenance of the myelin sheath of
Schwann cells and mast cell maturation [139]. In fact,
its pleiotropic nature is known to be cell-type-dependent
[140]. While NDRG1 is widely expressed and prominent
in normal cells and tissues [141], its expression is
significantly lower in various cancers, including breast,
colon and prostate tumors, particularly in patients
with bone or lymph node metastases [142–144]. The
expression of NDRG1 has also been demonstrated to have
a significant inverse correlation with the Gleason grading
and overall survival rate of prostate cancer patients [142],
as well as the depth of tumor invasion in pancreatic
adenocarcinoma patients [145]. These findings indicate an
important role for NDRG1 in regulating tumor metastasis
and subsequently render it an attractive target for the
treatment of cancer and its spread. It is well established
that intracellular iron levels regulate the expression of
NDRG1, with iron-depletion markedly up-regulating
NDRG1 at both the mRNA and protein levels in a variety
of different cancer cell-types [146, 147]. This occurs via
both hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)-dependent
and -independent mechanisms [146]. Moreover, it was
recently shown that translation of NDRG1 is enhanced
under conditions of cellular iron depletion via eukaryotic
initiation factor 3a (eIF3a) activity [148], which may
correlate to the HIF-1α-independent mechanism
previously identified [146].
NDRG1 is phosphorylated by serum and
glucocorticoid-induced kinase-1 (SGK1) at Ser330 and
Thr346, priming it as a substrate for glycogen synthase
kinase 3 β (GSK3β), which can further phosphorylate

PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
The PI3K/AKT pathway has emerged in recent
years as a key regulator of mammalian cell proliferation,
growth and survival [158] (Figure 3). Binding of insulin
or insulin-like growth factors to a receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK), such as insulin growth factor (IGF) binding to
18755

Oncotarget

insulin growth factor receptor (IGF-R) [159], results
in direct interaction between the RTK and regulatory
subunits of class I PI3Ks (e.g., p85α, p85β, p55γ)
[160, 161]. This enables the PI3K p110α/β/d catalytic
subunits to exhibit their kinase activity and catalyze the
phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-biphosphate
(PIP2) to phosphatyidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3)
[160, 161]. The generation of PIP3 in the membrane
then acts as a second messenger to activate downstream
signaling effectors, including the serine/threonine kinase
AKT. Specifically, PIP3 provides a docking site to recruit
3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinases (PDKs), to which
AKT subsequently binds to form the phosphorylated
form of AKT (p-AKT) that is active [162]. PIP3 levels
are tightly controlled in mammalian cells by the action of
PIP3 phosphatases, the most well characterized of which
is the tumor-suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homolog
deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN; Figure 3) [163].
The activation of AKT occurs via phosphorylation
of two residues, Ser473 and Thr308 [164], and leads to
multiple signaling cascades with important consequences
for cell survival, proliferation and growth [158]. PI3K/
AKT signaling functions as an anti-apoptotic pathway
by phosphorylating a pro-apoptotic member of the B-cell
lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins, i.e., Bcl-2associated death promoter (BAD; Figure 3), which forms
a non-functional heterodimer with anti-apoptotic B-cell
lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) [165].
Activated AKT promotes cell proliferation by
inhibiting GSK3β, a protein which increases cyclin D1
degradation and suppresses its expression [166, 167]
(Figure 3). AKT can also regulate the activity of a number
of transcription factors including cyclic-AMP response
element binding protein (CREB) [168], E2F [169], NF-κB
[170] and the forkhead transcription factors [171, 172], all
of which can promote cell proliferation or survival.
Another major target of PI3K/AKT signaling is the
serine/threonine kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR). The activation of mTOR could occur through
a number of mechanisms including direct interactions
with p-AKT itself [173], or p-AKT-mediated inhibition
of tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2), which then inhibits Rheb
and leads to activation of mTOR [174–176] (Figure 3).
Activation of mTOR has central roles in protein
translation and cell growth, by activating p70S6 kinase
and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding
proteins (eIF4E-BP), which enhance mRNA recruitment
to the ribosome for translation [177]. The mTOR pathway
also regulates the Bcl-2 proteins involved in apoptosis and
c-myc, thereby promoting cell survival, proliferation and
oncogenesis [178, 179] (Figure 3).
PI3K/AKT signaling is inappropriately activated
in many cancers by various mechanisms [180]. The
first genetic mechanism identified that results in
aberrant PI3K/AKT activation was the loss of the tumor
suppressor, PTEN [180–182]. PTEN inactivation is seen
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in endometrial, central nervous system, prostate, colon,
breast and liver tumors, amongst others [161]. Indeed,
loss of PTEN expression has been associated with a
higher Gleason grading in primary prostate tumors,
with metastases displaying an accumulation of PTEN
mutations [180].
Somatic activating mutations of the PI3K catalytic
subunit, p110α, which is encoded by the PIK3CA gene,
occur frequently in human cancers, including those of the
breast, prostate, colon, and endometrium [161]. Moreover,
some tumors (e.g., glioblastomas, colon and ovarian) also
harbor activating mutations of the p85α regulatory subunit
of PI3K, which is encoded by the PIK3R1 gene, leading
to constitutive PI3K-AKT signaling [183]. Furthermore,
constitutively activated p-AKT is found in 30–40% of
solid tumors [184], and high levels of p-AKT in prostate
cancer have been associated with a poorer prognosis for
patients [185].
Hyperactivation of PI3K-AKT signaling in cancer
has formed the underlying basis for targeted therapies
against this cascade that are currently in clinical
development, including dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors,
PI3K inhibitors, AKT inhibitors, and mTOR complex
catalytic site inhibitors [186]. Preclinical data suggests
that such agents may be effectively used to overcome
acquired resistance to therapies that target RTKs, such as
trastuzumab and erlotinib, and in combination with other
targeted therapies, such as mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors [180].
Recent studies have elucidated how iron chelators
target the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway in prostate cancer
as part of their anti-tumor activity [120]. Incubation of
prostate epithelial cells and the DU145 prostate cancer cell
line with DFO or Dp44mT increased expression of tumorsuppressive PTEN and anti-metastatic NDRG1 [120].
Moreover, NDRG1 over-expression attenuated oncogenic
p-AKT activity and significantly increased PTEN levels
[120]. NDRG1-mediated inhibition of p-AKT was also
observed in PTEN-null PC3 cells [107, 120], suggesting
that this effect occurred independently of PTEN.
In MIAPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells, NDRG1
over-expression also increased PTEN levels and decreased
p-AKT and p-mTOR levels [187]. Further, expression
of the PI3K regulatory subunits phospho-p85α and
phospho-p55γ was significantly reduced with NDRG1
over-expression, which prevents complex formation of
the PI3K p110α/β/δ catalytic subunits [187]. Given that
the thiosemicarbazones, Dp44mT and DpC, markedly
up-regulate NDRG1 in MIAPaCa-2 and other pancreatic
cancer cell lines [109], this suggests that NDRG1 could
also mediate its demonstrated anti-tumor activity in
pancreatic cancer through modulation of these critical
molecules in the PI3K/AKT/PTEN cascade.
Interestingly, iron chelators have been reported
to increase p-AKT levels [120, 188–190]. However,
this may be a short-term stress-induced response that

to phosphorylation and activation of AKT (p-AKT). PIP3 levels are controlled by the phosphatase PTEN to inhibit p-AKT, which affects
multiple cascades that control cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis, including GSK3β, mTOR, cyclin D1, c-myc, BAD and Bcl-2
(see text for more detail). Molecules negatively regulated by iron chelators are indicated by red boxes, and those positively regulated are

is not characterized by its classic signaling cascade,
and may be induced by these compounds before their
demonstrated anti-proliferative effects overwhelm this
initial pro-survival response. In fact, this elevation
in p-AKT levels was not found to correlate with
downstream activation of mTOR or increased cyclin
D1 expression in prostate cells [120], and was consistent
with previous reports that DFO inhibited cyclin
D1 expression [191].
Moreover, studies in K562 human myeloid leukemia
cells have demonstrated that the orally active iron chelator,
deferasirox, actually represses mTOR signaling [78].
This was observed to occur via enhanced expression of
regulated in development and DNA damage response
protein 1 (REDD1) and its downstream target, TSC2,
which inhibits mTOR activity. Moreover, deferasirox
repressed expression of S6 ribosomal protein and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phosphorylated S6, a downstream target of mTOR [78].
Given the potential of clinically available deferasirox
to be utilized as a chemotherapeutic agent [82, 83], this
reveals an important mechanism by which deferasirox can
modulate a key downstream mediator of oncogenic PI3K/
AKT signaling, which can also integrate signals from
other pathways (e.g., MAPK and TGF-β; see relevant
sections below Figures 4A, 4B) [192, 193].

Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
Mammalian cells possess four major MAPK protein
kinase cascades [194]. These include the Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway that is typically activated by growth
factors and cytokines, and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK), p38 and ERK5 pathways that can be activated
by environmental stress [194]. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK

18757

Oncotarget

cascade regulates a range of important cellular processes
including proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration
and angiogenesis [195]. It is activated at the cell surface
upon binding of ligands to RTKs such as epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR; also known as ErbB1 or
HER1), which was the first RTK to be discovered [196]
(Figure 4A). Three additional family members have been
subsequently identified, namely ErbB2/HER2, ErbB3/
HER3 and ErbB4/HER4 [197]. The binding of a growth
factor to its receptor (e.g., epidermal growth factor (EGF)
binding to EGFR), induces an extracellular conformational
change that facilitates the dimerization of two receptor
monomers [198]. This enables the auto-phosphorylation
of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic kinase domains
of the receptors that creates a high-affinity binding site
for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of growth factor
receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), thereby recruiting it to
the membrane [197]. Subsequently, the two Src homology
3 (SH3) domains of GRB2 interact with son of sevenless
(SOS), which facilitates the activation of the intracellular
transducer, Ras, by the exchange of GDP with GTP [199]
(Figure 4A).
Ras was the first identified oncogene involved
in neoplastic transformation, and is considered a key
player in regulating cell growth, integrating growth
factor signals with crucial effectors that relay these
signals to the nucleus [200–202]. Activated RAS (RASGTP) subsequently recruits and activates one of its
main effectors, the mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase kinase (MAPKKK, or MEKK), Raf [195]. Raf
phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
(MAPKK, or MEK), which then phosphorylates the
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), otherwise
known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs;
Figure 4A) [195]. Activated MAPKs can enter the
nucleus to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of
many transcription factors, including c-myc, Elk1, the
O subclass member of the forkhead family of transcription
factors (FOXO3), and CREB, to promote cell growth and
proliferation (Figure 4A) [195]. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway can also inhibit apoptosis by phosphorylating and
inactivating pro-apoptotic Bim and BAD, thus promoting
the anti-apoptotic roles of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [203–205].
Moreover, ERK has been implicated in the induction of
cell motility and metastasis through its ability to enhance
the activities of matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 (MMP-2/9)
[206] and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) [207].
Over-expression of EGFR is observed in more than
50% of carcinomas, and ErbB2 over-expression is seen in
30% of breast cancers [208]. Mutations in Ras occur in
more than 90% of pancreatic cancers, and are frequently
found in non-small-cell lung carcinomas, liver cancers,
melanomas and thyroid malignancies [209]. Identification
of these oncogenes has led to the development of targeted
therapeutics directed against critical molecules involved
in the EGFR-Ras-MAPK pathway [194]. Indeed, most
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

successful targeted therapies in the clinic are primarily
directed against tyrosine kinases involved in this pathway,
such as EGFR, ErbB2, BCR-ABL and KIT [210, 211].
Recently, we demonstrated that DFO and Dp44mT
could regulate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade by
decreasing phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in PC-3 and DU145
prostate cancer cells [120] (Figure 4A). Dp44mT could
also inhibit ERK1/2 activity in hepatocellular carcinoma
cells [108]. Given that ERK is activated by a range of
mitogenic stimuli and represents a critical convergence
point for multiple mitogenic signaling pathways [195], the
ability of iron chelators to attenuate its activation could
be an important mechanism by which they exert their
anti-cancer effects. Subsequent inhibition of effectors
downstream of ERK by these agents have also been
demonstrated, including mTOR [78] and c-myc [121].

JNK/p38
The JNK and p38 pathways are two parallel
MAPK pathways that are activated by various stress
stimuli, including cytokines, ultraviolet radiation and
oxidative stress [212]. These pathways participate in
signaling cascades controlling cellular responses to such
stimuli, and in contrast to ERKs, may primarily mediate
anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic processes [213]
(Figure 4A). However, the complexity of stress-activated
signaling networks means that this dichotomy is likely an
oversimplification, with the effects of these MAPKs being
context and cell-type dependent [214].
The JNK and p38 cascades can be activated by at
least four MAPKKKs, including MEKK1-4, apoptosis
signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), TGF-β activated
kinase 1 (TAK1) and mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) [214].
These MAPKKKs subsequently activate two distinct
subgroups of MAPKKs, namely MKK4/7 and MKK3/6
that activate JNK and p38 MAP kinases, respectively
[215] (Figure 4A). JNK and p38 regulate the activity of
several downstream kinases and transcription factors,
including p53, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2),
CREB and ETS domain-containing protein (Elk1), to
affect cell transcription, proliferation and survival [215,
216]. While altered expression of the MAPK proteins,
JNK and p38, are often observed in human tumor cell
lines and specimens, there is little evidence that these are
causally involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression
[217]. Interestingly, homozygous deletion or reduced
expression of MKK4 was reported in 75% of ovarian
serous carcinomas, which may contribute to development
of this tumor type [218]. There is also evidence that
MKK4 is mutated in pancreatic, breast, colon, lung
and testis cancers, albeit at a low frequency of genetic
inactivation of around 5% [219].
A role for iron depletion in mediating MAPK
signaling was demonstrated in human lymphocytes, where
DFO-induced apoptosis was mediated by activation of the

and cytokines, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade regulates cell growth and proliferation through multiple downstream effectors. ERK can
also inhibit canonical TGF-β signaling by phosphorylating SMAD2 at the linker region (p-SMAD2L), preventing nuclear translocation
of the SMAD2/3/4 complex and subsequent tumor-suppressive effects. The JNK and p38 pathways are two parallel MAPK cascades that
are also classically activated by stress stimuli and may primarily mediate pro-apoptotic processes. Iron chelation is known to modulate the
activities of ASK by dissociating its complex with thioredoxin (Trx), as well as JNK, p38, ERK and p-SMAD2L (see text for more detail).
B. Modulation of STAT3 signaling by iron chelators and integrated pathway crosstalk between the MAPK and AKT pathways.
STAT3 signaling is classically activated by cytokine receptor interactions, e.g., IL6/JAK, but can also be induced by growth factor receptor
tyrosine kinases, e.g., EGFR, and non-receptor kinases, e.g., Src and c-Abl. Evidence also exists for potential STAT3 pathway crosstalk
between the ERK and AKT pathways. Iron chelation has been demonstrated to inhibit STAT3 activity, which could be mediated by chelatormediated effects on upstream regulators of STAT3 (see text for details). Molecules that are negatively regulated by iron chelators are
indicated by red boxes, and those positively regulated are indicated by green boxes. Solid boxes indicate direct evidence for modulation by
iron chelators, while dashed boxes indicate potential indirect modulation, e.g., through chelator-mediated up-regulation of NDRG1. Dashed

JNK and p38 MAPKs [220] (Figure 4A). Activation of
the p38 pathway was supported by phosphorylation of the
upstream pathway proteins, MKK3 and MKK6, as well
as the downstream targets, ATF2 and MAPK-activated
protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2) [220].
More recent studies demonstrated that incubation
of DMS-53 lung cancer cells with the chelators, DFO and
Dp44mT, also increased JNK and p38 phosphorylation,
resulting in increased phosphorylation of the downstream
targets, p53 and ATF2 [221] (Figure 4A). Iron
supplementation experiments indicated that the ability
of DFO and Dp44mT to bind iron were crucial for their
effects on JNK activation, and that the ability of Dp44mT
to promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation also
contributed to this effect [221]. DFO- and Dp44mT-induced
JNK activation was found to be mediated by Trx oxidation
following iron chelation, causing dissociation of the ASK1Trx complex that normally inhibits ASK1 kinase activity
and subsequent ASK1-dependent apoptosis [221, 222].
However, studies in other cell-types have reported
some variable effects of chelators on MAPK signaling
pathways. For instance, using immortalized human
oral keratinocytes and the head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma HN4 cell line, incubation with DFO resulted
in increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and
p38 MAPKs, but with no effect on JNK activation [223].
Moreover, it was shown that activation of ERK and p38
were key effectors mediating downstream apoptotic
signaling through the caspase cascade and mitochondrial
release of cytochrome c [223]. DFO also activated ERK,
p38, and JNK in HL-60 human myeloid leukemia cells
that was accompanied by a similar activation of the
apoptotic cascade [224].
The observation that DFO increases phosphorylation
of ERK in this latter investigation is in contrast to
our previous study using prostate cancer cells that
demonstrated suppressed phosphorylated ERK levels in
response to DFO and Dp44mT [120]. This may indicate
potential cell-type differences in the regulation of MAPK
signaling and the complexities involved in cellular pathway
regulation by iron depletion. However, the reported effects
of iron chelation on activating p38 appear to be more
consistent, and it has been suggested that p38 functions as
a tumor suppressor since inhibition of p38 function plays
an important role in Ras-induced transformation [225].
Moreover, p38 MAPK was found to be a major mediator
of DFO-induced apoptosis over other MAPKs [224],
suggesting that the ability of iron chelators to modulate
this MAPK may be critical for their cytotoxic effects.

TGF-β receptor I (TGF-βRI) subunit to the complex and
causes phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues
on TGF-βRI, which activates its kinase activity [226].
The receptor SMADs, SMAD2 and SMAD3, which are
normally anchored by the cytoskeletal protein filamin A,
are translocated to the active TGF-βRI/II complex where
they are also phosphorylated at the C-termini at Ser465/467
(p-SMAD2C) and Ser423/425 [227, 228] (Figure 4A). This
results in the formation of heteromeric complexes with
cytosolic SMAD4 [229], which then translocates to the
nucleus, binds to SMAD-binding elements (SBE) and
thereby regulates TGF-β-responsive gene expression [229]
(Figure 4A).
The canonical tumor-suppressive actions of TGF-β
are mediated by its effects on the cell cycle, through the
up-regulation of the CDK inhibitors, p15, p21WAF1/CIP1 and
p27KIP1, as well as down-regulation of c-myc [230]. TGF-β
also promotes apoptosis through up-regulation of proapoptotic Bax, increased activation of effector caspases, and
down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [231]. TGF-β has
been shown to cause significant reduction in proliferation
and induction of cell death in human prostatic epithelial
cells [232] and some prostate cancer cell lines [233].
The level of TGF-β/SMAD signaling in cells has
been reported to be negatively regulated by the Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, which is induced by EGF
receptor signaling [234]. Specifically, Ras signaling
inhibits the TGF-β-induced nuclear accumulation of
the SMAD complex by phosphorylating SMAD2 at the
linker region (p-SMAD2L), which is distinct from the
TGF-β receptor phosphorylation site [234] (Figure 4A).
In normal epithelial cells, TGF-β potently overcomes
the proliferative effects of Ras-activating factors [235],
suggesting Ras-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2
serves to adjust the level of TGF-β/SMAD signaling
according to the level of Ras activity in these cells.
However, in cancer cells where Ras is hyper-activated
by oncogenic mutations, this same mechanism may act
to silence the tumor-suppressive functions of TGF-β/
SMAD signaling and consequently promote tumor
progression [234]. This suggests that in Ras-transformed
cancer cells, inhibiting the phosphorylation of SMAD2 at
the linker region may be a worthy therapeutic strategy to
consider.
As previously mentioned, DFO and Dp44mT
can attenuate phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in PC-3 and
DU145 prostate cancer cells [120]. This study also
demonstrated that these compounds could decrease levels
of p-SMAD2L. Conversely, no changes were observed in
the phosphorylation of SMAD2 at the C-terminal region
(p-SMAD2C) that is regulated by TGF-β activation
in these cells [120]. Thus, taken together, DFO and
Dp44mT could suppress ERK1/2 to subsequently inhibit
the oncogenic effects of SMAD2 phosphorylated at the
linker region. This effect could modulate canonical

by the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), indicating
that ROS generation by these compounds is involved in
their STAT3-inhibitory properties [121]. Both Dp44mT
and DpC could also inhibit IL-6-induced phosphorylation
and nuclear translocation of STAT3, which has been
implicated in tumor progression [121, 248]. These
findings were reiterated in vivo in a PANC-1 tumor
xenograft model where Dp44mT- or DpC-treated tumors
displayed significantly lower staining for p-STAT3 and
STAT3 compared to tumors from vehicle control-treated
mice  [121]. Similar findings were also observed in
studies examining hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines,
where Dp44mT suppressed p-STAT3 levels, possibly
through up-regulation of the NDRG family member,
NDRG2 [108].
Interestingly, serine phosphorylation of STAT3
by ERK has been reported to negatively modulate
STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and activity [250, 251],
while other studies implicate the MEK/ERK cascade in
positively mediating STAT3 activity [252–254]. The AKT/
PTEN pathway has also been reported to regulate STAT3
[255, 256], and it was recently suggested that STAT3
occupies a central role in integrating pathway crosstalk
between the MAPK and AKT pathways [257]. Given these
interactions, it is possible that the effects of iron chelators
on the STAT3 pathway are, at least in part, influenced
by their modulation of the ERK and AKT pathways
(Figure 4B). Indeed, more detailed characterization of
the complex crosstalk between these and potentially other
pathways that mediate the anti-neoplastic activities of iron
chelators is required.

the effects of C-terminal-phosphorylated SMAD2
(Figure 4A).

STAT3 signaling
The STAT family consists of seven proteins that
transduce extracellular signals to regulate genes involved
in cell growth, survival and differentiation [236]. Of these,
STAT3 is the most well characterized and has been linked
to tumor progression [236]. STAT3 signaling is classically
known to be activated by upstream cytokine receptor
interactions, such as those resulting from interleukins
and interferons activating the Janus tyrosine kinases
(JAKs) [237]. However, STAT3 signaling can also be
induced by growth factor RTKs (e.g., EGFR) and nonreceptor kinases (e.g., Src, c-Abl) [238–240] (Figure 4B).
Activation of STAT3 results in its phosphorylation at
Tyr705 (p-STAT3), leading to dimer formation, nuclear
translocation, binding to STAT3-specific DNA-binding
elements and transcription of target genes [240].
The wide and varied cellular effects of STAT3
signaling include the promotion of cell cycle progression
by up-regulating cyclin D1, c-myc and pim-1, and
suppression of apoptosis through Bcl-2, myeloid leukemia
cell differentiation protein 1 (Mcl-1) and cellular inhibitor
of apoptosis 2 (c-IAP2) expression [236, 241] (Figure 4B).
STAT3 has also been shown to repress p53 expression, with
blockade of STAT3 in cancer cells leading to p53-mediated
apoptosis [242]. Several lines of evidence also implicate
STAT3 in tumor cell invasion, migration and immune
evasion as well as the EMT by promoting Rho ­GTPaseregulated cell migration and regulating the expression of
MMPs, E-cadherin, zinc-finger E-box-binding (ZEB) and
vimentin, amongst others [236, 243–245].
Cancers of the prostate, pancreas and breast, as
well as leukemias and melanomas, have all been reported
to display constitutive activation of STAT3 [246, 247].
This has directed numerous recent efforts to develop new
therapies targeting the STAT3 pathway, including direct
inhibitors of STAT3, IL-6 receptor antagonists, antisense
strategies and decoy phosphopeptides [248, 249].
Recently, we demonstrated that iron chelators
regulate the STAT3 pathway in pancreatic and prostate
cancer cells through inhibition of constitutive and
IL-6-induced STAT3 activation [121] (Figure 4B).
The chelators, DFO, Dp44mT and DpC, inhibited
constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3, dimerization,
binding of STAT3 to its target DNA sequence, and the
expression of STAT3 targets (i.e., c-myc, cyclin D1
and Bcl-2) [121]. This may be, in part, mediated by the
ability of these compounds to decrease activation of
the upstream kinases, Src and c-Abl, that are known to
promote STAT3 signaling [121] (Figure 4B). Further,
the redox-active Dp44mT- and DpC-iron complexes also
inhibited STAT3 activation and this could be prevented

The EMT
The EMT refers to the transient differentiation
process whereby epithelial cells lose their polarity and
cell-cell junctions, reorganize their cytoskeleton, and
induce signaling changes that reprogram gene expression
and cell shape [258]. While EMT plays important roles
during embryogenesis and wound healing, its underlying
processes are reactivated in the pathological processes of
fibrogenesis and tumorigenesis [258]. Repression of the
epithelial phenotype and activation of the mesenchymal
phenotype involves changes in the gene expression of
many molecules, including the master transcription
factor regulators, Snail, Slug, Twist, and ZEB [258]
(Figure 5). These proteins often regulate the expression
of each other as well as other target genes, including the
down-regulation of E-cadherin, occludin and claudins
that maintain cell tight junctions, and the up-regulation
of N-cadherin, MMPs, vimentin and fibronectin that are
essential for promoting motility and invasiveness [259].
Two major signaling pathways that induce EMT via these
effectors are the TGF-β and Wnt pathways, both of which
have been demonstrated to be regulated by iron chelation
[156, 260] (Figure 5).

Figure 5: Iron chelators regulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and molecular motors involved in
cancer cell migration and metastasis. Non-canonical activation of TGF-β signaling promotes tumor progression, EMT and metastasis

via SMAD, MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways that up-regulate mesenchymal-associated transcription factors (e.g., Snail, Slug, Twist and
ZEB) and repress E-cadherin expression. The Wnt signaling pathway also regulates EMT through its inhibition of GSK3β-mediated
degradation of β-catenin, Snail and Slug. TGF-β can also activate Rho/ROCK/MLC signaling to drive dynamic actin reorganization
required for metastasis. Iron chelators have been demonstrated to inhibit the EMT and metastasis by maintaining expression of E-cadherin
and β-catenin at cell membranes, and may also mediate these effects through regulation of other upstream cascades (see text for more
details). Molecules negatively regulated by iron chelators are indicated by red boxes, and those positively regulated are indicated by green
boxes. Solid boxes indicate direct evidence for modulation by iron chelators, while dashed boxes indicate potential indirect modulation,
e.g., through chelator-mediated up-regulation of NDRG1.

The role of TGF-β signaling in cancer is complex
and paradoxical. In contrast to canonical tumorsuppressive TGF-β signaling in normal  epithelial  cells
(described above), non-canonical TGF-β signaling is known
to play important roles in promoting tumor progression
and metastasis via induction of the EMT, stimulating
cell proliferation and evasion of the immune system
[259, 261]. This effect probably results from progressive
mutations that collectively inactivate the core elements of
the TGF-β signaling cascade and its downstream effectors,
allowing tumor cells to escape the tumor-suppressive
mechanisms of TGF-β and activate oncogenic signaling
pathways [259]. In fact, TGF-β stimulation has been
observed to induce cell proliferation via the Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway, rather than suppress it via normal SMAD
signaling, in TSU-Pr1 prostate cancer cells [262]. SMADwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dependent TGF-β signaling promotes EMT by activating
the mesenchymal-associated transcription factors, Snail,
Slug, Twist and ZEB1, amongst others [263–265]. Further,
SMADs also up-regulate cytoskeleton-associated genes
that mediate cell motility and invasion, including vimentin
and fibronectin [266].
In addition to activating the trimeric SMAD complex,
TGF-β can also activate the MAPK, Rho/Rho-associated,
coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) and
PI3K pathways, amongst others [261, 267] (Figure 5).
Each of these pathways can also contribute to the EMT.
For example, ERK MAPK signaling enhances repression
of E-cadherin and activates Twist, N-cadherin and MMP
expression [268, 269]. TGF-β-mediated activation of PI3K/
AKT signaling induces activation of mammalian target of
rapamycin complexes 1/2 (mTORC1/2) that aids the EMT,
18762

increasing expression of Snail and MMP-9, and repressing
E-cadherin expression [270, 271]. Phosphorylation
and inhibition of GSK3β that is regulated by AKT also
stabilizes Snail and Slug expression [272, 273]. Moreover,
TGF-β can also induce the activation of Rho-like GTPases,
e.g., RhoA, that then activates the ROCK1 and LIM kinase
(LIMK) pathways to drive dynamic actin reorganization,
lamellipodia and filopodia formation required for the EMT
[274, 275] (Figure 5).
Another key regulator of EMT is the Wnt signaling
pathway that has canonical roles in development,
tumorigenesis and metastatic progression [276]. It is
activated at the plasma membrane by binding of Wnt
ligands to its co-receptors, Frizzled and LDL receptorrelated protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) [277]. In the absence
of Wnt signaling, the destruction complex, which
is composed of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC),
axin and GSK3β, phosphorylates β-catenin that then
promotes its proteasomal degradation [276] (Figure 5).
However, in the presence of Wnt ligands, this complex
disintegrates, stabilizing free β-catenin in the cytosol and
allowing its nuclear translocation where it interacts with
T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor
(LEF) transcription factors to promote transcription of
pro-metastatic genes [276]. Wnt signaling also inhibits
GSK3β-mediated degradation of the mesenchymal
transcription factors, Snail and Slug [278, 279] (Figure 5).
Recent studies have identified important roles
for cellular iron in regulating the EMT that occur via
iron chelator-mediated up-regulation of the metastasis
suppressor, NDRG1 [146, 147]. In DU145 prostate
and HT29 colon cancer cells, the chelators DFO and
Dp44mT attenuated TGF-β-induced loss of E-cadherin
and β-catenin at the cell membrane (Figure 5), and also
decreased TGF-β-induced up-regulation of vimentin
[156]. This demonstrated that these iron chelators could
inhibit TGF-β-induced EMT in these cells. Moreover,
NDRG1 expression, which is markedly up-regulated
by these compounds, also inhibited the TGF-β-induced
EMT in DU145 and HT29 cells [156]. Specifically,
NDRG1 knockdown in these cells assumed a spindleshaped morphology, abolished expression of E-cadherin
and β-catenin at the membrane, and increased nuclear
expression of β-catenin [156]. NDRG1 over-expression in
DU145 and HT29 cells attenuated the ability of TGF-β
to induce changes to morphology and expression of EMT
markers that are characteristic of the EMT, as well as the
migratory and invasive potential of these cells [156]. This
effect was found to involve the transcriptional E-cadherin
repressors, Snail and Slug. Similar outcomes from
NDRG1 inhibiting the EMT were also reported in oral
squamous cell carcinoma cells through up-regulation of
E-cadherin and down-regulation of N-cadherin, vimentin,
Snail, Slug, MMP-2 and MMP-9 [280]. Further studies
revealed that NDRG1 inhibits β-catenin phosphorylation

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and nuclear translocation, specifically by up-regulating
FRAT1, which prevents GSK3β from binding the
β-catenin destruction complex [281]. NDRG1 could also
inhibit β-catenin nuclear translocation that is mediated by
Wnt signaling via reducing nuclear localization of p21
activated kinase 4 (PAK4) [281]. Together, these NDRG1mediated effects lead to increased levels of β-catenin that
is expressed at the cell membrane, where it functions to
promote cell adhesion, while inhibiting its localization in
the cell nucleus, where it is oncogenic [281, 282].
Studies performed in PC3mm metastatic prostate
and MCF7 breast cancer cells demonstrated that NDRG1
interacts with the Wnt receptor, LRP6, subsequently
blocking the Wnt cascade to suppress the EMT and
metastasis by reactivating GSK3β, promoting β-catenin
degradation, and inhibiting downstream expression
of ATF3 [107]. Moreover, these studies showed that
Dp44mT could significantly enhance NDRG1 expression
in human breast cancer cells and suppress bone metastasis
in vivo [107]. This observation indicated that Dp44mTmediated NDRG1 up-regulation could play a critical role
in negatively regulating Wnt signaling during EMT and
metastasis (Figure 5).
Multiple iron chelators, including DFO, deferasirox
and a series of acyl hydrazones have been shown to
destabilize β-catenin, subsequently inhibiting Wnt signaling
to inhibit colorectal cancer cell growth [260]. These agents
also decreased the expression of Wnt target genes, which
was shown to occur via β-catenin degradation downstream
of the destruction complex. Excess iron levels have also
been implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis through
enhancement of Wnt signaling in cells displaying APC loss
or abnormal β-catenin expression [283]. This effect increased
cellular proliferation, correlating with increased mRNA
expression of its targets, c-myc and Naked cuticle 1 (Nkd1).
Collectively, these studies identify important roles for iron
in the regulation of multiple EMT mediators that could be
exploited in cancer therapy using potent iron chelators.
Interestingly, DFO has also been reported to
promote the EMT and enhance cell migration and invasion
in HT29 cells, which was suggested to be mediated by
DFO-induced HIF-1 expression [284]. However, this is
in contrast with multiple reports previously described
indicating that DFO exhibits inhibitory effects on tumor
growth and the EMT [5, 156, 260], possibly reflecting
differences in experimental conditions utilized in the study.

Migration and metastasis
In addition to regulating the EMT, directed cell
invasion and migration of tumor cells is required for
metastasis [285]. This process involves multiple events,
including F-actin polymerization, its interaction with
myosin II filaments, and the subsequent formation
of contractile actomyosin structures such as stress

18763

Oncotarget

fibers  [286]. These are rearranged and extended within
the cell in response to various signaling cues to promote
cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility [287]. The
small Rho-GTPase family is involved in regulating
stress fiber assembly, contraction and motility through
effectors such as Rho and Rac [288]. These molecules can
subsequently regulate multiple targets to regulate the actin
cytoskeleton, including the p21 activated kinase (PAK),
ROCK1/myosin light chain (MLC) and LIMK pathways
that mediate the formation and contractility of stress fibers
[289], of which phosphorylated MLC is a key mediator of
actin filament polymerization, stress fiber assembly and
cell migration [290].
We recently demonstrated that iron chelation could
inhibit cell migration and metastasis by modulating the
ROCK1/MLC2 cascade [157] (Figure 5). Specifically,
DFO, Dp44mT and DpC decreased the expression of
ROCK1 and phosphorylated MLC2 in DU145, HT29 and
HCT116 cells [157]. Importantly, the observed effects of
these iron chelators was likely mediated via the ability of
these agents to up-regulate NDRG1, since suppression
of endogenous NDRG1 expression at least partially
attenuated the ability of the chelators to inhibit ROCK1
expression, MLC2 phosphorylation and migration [157].
These studies elucidated the inhibitory role of NDRG1
on the ROCK1/MLC2 pathway, with NDRG1 overexpression inhibiting F-actin polymerization and stress
fiber formation through regulation of this cascade [157].
To further understand the role of NDRG1 in cellular
migration, its effects on the oncogene, c-Src, were
important to investigate as the downstream effectors of
this molecule play critical roles in regulating this process
[291, 292]. Importantly, NDRG1 inhibited Src-induced
phosphorylation of p130Cas and prevented its complex
formation with CrkII [293]. In addition, NDRG1 could
decrease activation of c-Abl and subsequent CrkII
phosphorylation [293]. Collectively, this resulted in the
inhibition of Rac1 signaling and decreased levels of
downstream phosphorylated PAK1, playing critical roles
in cytoskeletal dynamics and the regulation of cell motility
[294]. Given that the iron chelators, DFO, Dp44mT and
DpC, have been demonstrated to inhibit Src and c-Abl
activity in certain cancer cell-types [121] and that they can
markedly up-regulate NDRG1, it is plausible that these
compounds could exhibit their anti-metastatic effects via
NDRG1-mediated modulation of these pathways.

microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)
is converted from its soluble form (LC3-I) to its lipidbound form (LC3-II) and is expressed on the membrane
of phagophores, subsequently leading to the formation
of double-membrane vesicles, i.e., autophagosomes,
which engulf the target cargo [296]. The autophagosome
subsequently matures by fusing with a lysosome to
form an autolysosome, exposing the cargo to lysosomal
hydrolases that promote degradation of its contents and
nutrient recycling [297] (Figure 6).
Complex signaling networks control mammalian
autophagy, with the integration of stress signals through the
PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway acting as a core negative
regulator of the autophagic machinery [297]. Activation
of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade inhibits TSC2 [174],
activating the mTORC1 complex and inhibiting formation
of a trimeric unc-51-like kinase (ULK) complex required
for autophagosome formation from the phagophore [298].
Thus, mTORC1 activity inhibits autophagic initiation
(Figure 6). Another key regulator of autophagy is
adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), which acts
as a major stimulator of autophagy through its ability to
activate TSC1/2 and suppress mTORC1 signaling [298–
300], but also potentially through direct phosphorylation
of ULK [301].
Activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress pathway and unfolded protein response can also
potently induce autophagy [299]. Specifically, the binding
of accumulated unfolded proteins to the ER chaperone
Grp78/Bip induces the release of three ER membraneassociated proteins that trigger distinct pathways, namely
protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK),
activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositolrequiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) [302]. Phosphorylation and
activation of PERK directly induces phosphorylation of
eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) that is critical for
the transcription of key autophagy-associated genes during
ER stress, mediating LC3 conversion and subsequent
autophagosome formation [303] (Figure 6).
Autophagy serves dual roles in tumorigenesis and
tumor progression [299]. Since defects in autophagy have
been linked with susceptibility to genomic damage and
tumorigenesis in mice [304], autophagy could suppress
tumorigenesis by limiting cell growth and genomic
instability [305]. However, autophagy can also maintain
the survival of tumor cells, allowing adaptation to stress
conditions induced by high metabolic demands, hypoxic
tumor microenvironments or chemotherapeutics [299]. In
human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines and tumor
specimens, high levels of basal autophagy allowed the
maintenance of cellular energy production that fuelled tumor
growth [306]. Moreover, inhibiting autophagy in these cells
by genetic means or chloroquine treatment promoted tumor
regression of xenografts in vivo and mice survival [306].
Indeed, this has formed the underlying basis for preclinical

ER stress and autophagy
Autophagy refers to a homeostatic, catabolic process
that degrades cellular proteins and organelles to sustain
cellular metabolism under conditions of stress [295]. It is
initiated by the formation of crescent-shaped structures
called phagophores that surround targeted cytoplasmic
constituents [296] (Figure 6). Concomitantly, lipid-bound

Figure 6: Iron chelation modulates ER stress and autophagy pathways. Autophagy involves the formation of double-membrane

vesicles from phagophores, i.e., autophagosomes, which engulf cytoplasmic contents and organelles. Fusion of the autophagosome with a
lysosome forms an autolysosome that results in the degradation of its contents, nutrient recycling and autophagic cell survival. However,
prolonged autophagy in certain settings can also lead to non-apoptotic autophagic cell death. Two core regulators of autophagy include the
PERK/eIF2α pathway that is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway. Iron chelators have
been demonstrated to modulate both these pathways and subsequent autophagic processes, and also enhance expression of LC3-II, which is
recruited to autophagosomal membranes during induction of autophagy (see text for more details). Molecules negatively regulated by iron
chelators are indicated by red boxes, and those positively regulated are indicated by green boxes.

and ongoing clinical studies that are administering autophagy
inhibitors, e.g., chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, in
combination with chemotherapy [299].
However, prolonged autophagy in certain cellular
settings can overwhelm the capacity of the cell, leading to
a non-apoptotic pro-death pathway known as autophagic
cell death [307]. Thus, targeting autophagy for cancer
treatment presents as a “double-edged sword”, with
its role in tumor progression and treatment response
remaining incompletely understood. Harnessing this prodeath cascade of the autophagic process could be a novel
vantage point of attack against tumor cells already existing
under conditions of high stress.
Recently, it was demonstrated that Dp44mT
modulates the autophagic process to favor cell death
in breast cancer cells by increasing autophagosome

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

synthesis, but also inhibiting subsequent autolysosome
formation by impairing lysosomal integrity [308]. This
illustrates a unique mechanism by which the double-edged
autophagic machinery can be exploited in cancer therapy.
Specifically, Dp44mT induced autophagic initiation
as demonstrated by increased LC3-II levels, and also
increased expression of another autophagy marker, namely
p62, due to suppressed autophagosome degradation
[308]. This latter effect was found to be dependent on the
ability of Dp44mT to generate ROS, which subsequently
permeate and destabilize the lysosome, preventing
autolysosome formation and autophagosome degradation
[308]. Thus, rather than enabling completion of the
autophagic process that typically promotes cancer cell
survival through nutrient recycling, the accumulation
of damaged proteins and organelles triggers cell death

18765

Oncotarget

[308] (Figure 6). These  studies also postulated that
DFO inhibited autophagosome degradation, but did not
increase autophagosome synthesis, and thus, led to LC3II accumulation in these cells [308].
The chelators, DFO and Dp44mT, also induced
autophagy in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells as
demonstrated by increased LC3-II expression [309]. This
occurred via induction of ER stress and activation of
the PERK/eIF2α signaling cascade, as demonstrated by
increased levels of p-PERK and p-eIF2α [309]. The ability
of these compounds to sequester cellular iron was critical
for its effects on autophagy induction, as incubation with
the DFO:Fe complex or Dp2mT did not exhibit the same
effects [309]. Incubation with iron- or copper-complexed
Dp44mT also elevated LC3-II expression, which was
attenuated by NAC, indicating that Dp44mT-mediated
redox activity is important for its role in regulating LC3-II
expression [309]. Interestingly, NDRG1 was found to
suppress the stress-induced autophagic response, which
could mediate the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities
of NDRG1 by enhancing apoptosis and inhibiting
metastasis [309]. This was shown to occur via inhibition
of the PERK/eIF2α pathway involved in the unfolded
protein response [309].
Given that Dp44mT markedly up-regulates NDRG1,
the seemingly opposing effects of Dp44mT and NDRG1
on autophagy appear contradictory [309]. However,
the initial Dp44mT-mediated activation of autophagic
initiation is likely to be subsequently suppressed due to
up-regulation of NDRG1 following longer periods of
exposure to Dp44mT [309]. This is consistent with the
notion that NDRG1 acts in response to cellular stress
[148, 310], which could lead to suppression of stressinduced autophagy [309]. Further, in addition to the
generation of ROS by Dp44mT that causes lysosomal
membrane permeabilization that disturbs the autophagic
process [308], it is important to note that Dp44mT affects
multiple cellular targets to induce its anti-tumor activity,
as described herein and elsewhere [5].
Autophagy has also been implicated in the antitumor mechanism of DFO and deferasirox in multiple
myeloma cell lines [311]. Specifically, exposure of
myeloma cell lines to DFO and deferasirox markedly
induced LC3-II expression concomitant with induction of
autophagy, and the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine
rescued these cells from chelator-induced cytotoxicity
[311]. This was potentially mediated by the suppressive
effect of these compounds on the mTORC1 substrate
p70S6 kinase, which negatively regulates autophagy
[312]. Moreover, DFO was shown to induce autophagy
flux and decrease caspase activation, inhibiting TRAILmediated apoptosis, in colon cancer cells [313].
Of importance, the iron storage protein, ferritin,
is reported to be degraded in the cell via autophagy
[314, 315]. Multiple iron chelators can direct the pathway
via which ferritin is degraded in cells [316]. In these
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studies, incubation of cells with poorly permeable DFO
resulted in lysosome-mediated degradation of ferritin
via autophagy [316]. The smaller, more lipophilic
and membrane-permeable ligands, deferasirox and
deferiprone, diverted ferritin degradation towards the
proteasomal pathway [316]. This contrasted with previous
findings [311], which may be explained by cell-typedependent differences in the regulation of autophagic
processing. Moreover, considering that autophagy is
a dynamic process [317], and that these latter studies
only visualized LC3-II-containing autophagosomes as
a autophagic marker [311, 316], further studies utilizing
late-stage autophagy inhibitors, such as bafilomycin A1
or choloroquine, in combination with iron chelators are
necessary to determine whether the increased number
of autophagosomes observed are due to enhanced
autophagic initiation or suppression of lysosomalmediated autophagic degradation [317]. Collectively, these
recent studies clearly identify induction of autophagy as a
potential mediator of cytotoxic iron chelators, requiring
further elucidation of the precise mechanisms responsible
to aid its clinical application (Figure 6).

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
Compelling evidence exists to support the preclinical
and clinical development of DpT thiosemicarbazones
as anti-cancer agents. Moreover, these compounds
demonstrate synergistic activities with existing
chemotherapies including gemcitabine, cisplatin,
doxorubicin and tamoxifen [113, 318]. Thus, these
compounds could be effectively utilized in combination
cancer therapies.
Major advances have been achieved in recent
years in terms of gaining mechanistic insight into how
the DpT ligands exert their multi-modal effects at
the molecular level by targeting oncogenic signaling
pathways. This is a critical step in the development of
these compounds, providing valuable information related
to their potential application as multi-targeted therapies
based on the genetic profiles and stages of individual
tumors. However, differences between cancer cell-types
as well as complexities in signaling pathway crosstalk and
feedback loops mean that the molecular mechanisms of
DpT thiosemicarbazones still require careful elucidation.
The studies described herein will no doubt provide a
solid foundation for future studies and provide necessary
justification for the planned clinical trials in humans.
