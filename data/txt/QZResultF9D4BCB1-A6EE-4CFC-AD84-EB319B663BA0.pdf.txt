ABSTRACT
Biomarkers predicting treatment response to the monoclonal antibody
cetuximab in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(LAHNSCC) are lacking. We hypothesize that tumor accessibility is an
important factor in treatment success of the EGFR targeting drug. We
quantified uptake of cetuximab labeled with Zirconium-89 (89Zr) using PET/
CT imaging.
Seventeen patients with stage III-IV LAHNSCC received a loading dose
unlabeled cetuximab, followed by 10 mg 54.5±9.6 MBq 89Zr-cetuximab. PET/
CT images were acquired either 3 and 6 or 4 and 7 days post-injection.
89
Zr-cetuximab uptake was quantified using standardized uptake value
(SUV) and tumor-to-background ratio (TBR), and correlated to EGFR
immunohistochemistry. TBR was compared between scan days to determine
optimal timing.
Uptake of 89Zr-cetuximab varied between patients (day 6-7: SUVpeak range 2.56.2). TBR increased significantly (49±28%, p < 0.01) between first (1.1±0.3) and
second scan (1.7±0.6). Between groups with a low and high EGFR expression a
significant difference in SUVmean (2.1 versus 3.0) and SUVpeak (3.2 versus 4.7) was
found, however, not in TBR. Data is available at www.cancerdata.org (DOI: 10.17195/
candat.2016.11.1).

In conclusion, 89Zr-cetuximab PET imaging shows large inter-patient
variety in LAHNSCC and provides additional information over FDG-PET and
EGFR expression. Validation of the predictive value is recommended with
scans acquired 6-7 days post-injection.

INTRODUCTION

The main aims of this study were to quantify the
uptake of 89Zr-cetuximab in the tumor and involved
lymph nodes in patients with LAHNSCC and to
determine optimal timing of imaging after 89Zr-cetuximab
administration. The secondary aim was to correlate 89Zrcetuximab uptake with EGFR expression and metabolic
activity as determined by 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
PET/CT scan.

Locally-advanced head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (LAHNSCC) are challenging to treat. The
majority of patients presents with locally advanced
cancers at the time of diagnosis [1]. Although advances in
surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy have improved
survival over the last decade, the prognosis remains poor
[2]. Patients with advanced loco-regional disease require
multimodality treatment [3]. For (functionally) irresectable
tumors, radiotherapy is combined with concurrent cisplatin
[4, 5] or with the targeted drug cetuximab [6]. Cetuximab
is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody
targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
This receptor activates several pathways that are involved
in cell proliferation and survival. The EGF receptor is
overexpressed in most LAHNSCC and is related to radioand chemotherapy resistance [7, 8]. Cetuximab binds to
the extracellular domain of EGFR, blocks ligand binding
and, as a result, prevents receptor activation [9-12].
Radiotherapy combined with either cisplatin or
cetuximab have both shown improved treatment results
over radiotherapy alone [6, 13]. However, addition
of cetuximab to chemoradiotherapy or substituting
radiotherapy combined cisplatin by cetuximab did not
show any additional benefit [14-16]. Most likely not all
patients will benefit equally from the same treatment,
for example due to inter-tumor heterogeneity and patient
related factors, making patient tailored treatment essential.
Several measures were proposed for predicting cetuximab
treatment efficacy, including drug-induced skin-rash,
EGFR protein expression and -gene mutations [17, 18].
So far, the predictive value of these markers has been
inconclusive. We hypothesize that the accessibility of the
cetuximab into the tumor is an important predictive marker
in the treatment efficacy [19]. In tumors lacking EGFR
expression, response to the targeted drug is unexpected
regardless of accessibility, while in tumors with an
EGFR overexpression, the accessibility of the tumor
is expected to be a determining factor in drug uptake.
Imaging with radioactive labeled cetuximab could be
used to non-invasively quantify the uptake of cetuximab.
Ultimately, drug uptake imaging could be applied in clinic
for pre-treatment patient selection (e.g. in combination
with decision support systems [20, 21]), and treatment
evaluation during therapy.
Since antibodies like cetuximab have a long half-life
in the blood pool (69 - 95 hours) radioactive labelling with
the long lived positron emitter Zirconium-89 (89Zr) was
chosen (half-life of 78 hours) [22, 23]. Aerts et al. [19]
proved in an animal study that in vivo imaging of 89Zrcetuximab is feasible and also showed a disparity between
89
Zr-cetuximab uptake and EGFR-expression of the tumor
cells. Moreover, it was shown in a phase I first in human
study that 89Zr-cetuximab can be safely administered to
patients [24].

RESULTS
The first 17 patients (12 males, 5 females; age
range 45-68y) enrolled in the ARTFORCE study received
89
Zr-cetuximab imaging and were analyzed. After a
minimum follow-up of 2 years, 3 patients presented
with a locoregional recurrence and 3 patients developed
metastasis. (Supplementary Table 1). Average primary
tumor volume was 41.7 ± 24.7 cm3. Sixteen of the
seventeen patients had regional lymph nodes metastasis.
Fifteen patients had 89Zr-cetuximab scans at two time
points available for analysis; for two patients only the
scan at the second time point could be used. One of
those patients refused a scan and for the other patient a
scan was excluded because the aortic arch was not in the
field of view. Those two patients were excluded for the
optimal timing and temporal stability analysis; the data
was used for the other analyses. All patients underwent
pre-treatment FDG PET/CT scan. The patient and tumor
characteristics are listed in Table 1.
Quantitative PET analysis showed a large interpatient variety of tracer uptake. For the first scan the
SUVpeak ranged between patients from 2.5 - 6.2, SUVmax
from 2.8 -7.9, SUVmean from 1.8 - 4.0 and TBR from 0.7 2.1. For the second scan the SUVpeak ranged from 2.5 - 6.2,
SUVmax from 2.9 - 7.7, SUVmean from 1.6 - 3.9 and TBR
from 1.0 - 2.6. Average SUVpeak, SUVmax, SUVmean and
TBR values for the primary tumor and the lymph nodes,
for the first and second 89Zr-cetuximab PET/CT scan are
shown in Table 2. The 89Zr-cetuximab TBR in the primary
tumor was for all patients higher on the second scan
compared to the first scan. The TBR increased on average
with 49% ± 28 % (p <0.01), indicating an improved
imaging quantification profile at the later time points. The
two 89Zr-cetuximab scans of an example patient are shown
in Figure 1. In Figure 2 the TBR is plotted as function of
the number of days after 89Zr-cetuximab administration for
the individual patients.
In patients with a high 89Zr-cetuximab uptake in
the primary tumor, in general also an elevated maximum
uptake in the lymph nodes was observed, as shown in
Supplementary Figure 1. For the second scan a strong,
significant correlation was found between the TBR in the
lymph nodes and primary tumor (r = 0.76, p < 0.01).
The voxel-based comparison between the two 89Zrcetuximab uptake patterns, showed correlation coefficients
ranging from 0.18 - 0.86, see Supplementary Table 1. The

patients with a low 89Zr-cetuximab uptake (TBR < 1.2),
and plausible less specific tracer uptake in the tumor, had
correlation coefficients of 0.18, 0.20 and 0.66. Excluding
these patients with low uptake levels, resulted for the
remaining 13 patients in an average spatial correlation of
0.68 ± 0.11 between the two scans.
In Figure 1 (C and F) the FDG PET/CT scan is
displayed for comparison with the 89Zr-cetuximab PET/
CT scan. No correlation was found between the FDG
SUVpeak and 89Zr-cetuximab SUVpeak in the primary tumor,
for the first (r = 0.11, p = 0.69) or second 89Zr-cetuximab
PET/CT scan (r = 0.46, p = 0.07). Comparison of the high
spatial uptake regions showed only minor overlap between
high 89Zr-cetuximab uptake regions (TBR > 1.2 or 1.4)
and high FDG uptake regions (> 50% of SUVmax). The
volumes of the high uptake regions and DICE scores are
given in Table 2.
The EGFR IHC scores showed seven tumors (41%)
with a low EGFR expression, IHC < 200, (IHC: 76±79)
and ten tumors (59%) with a high expression, IHC ≥ 200,
(IHC: 230±29). Based on the second 89Zr-cetuximab PET/
CT scan, the SUVmean was 2.1±0.5 and 3.0±0.6 for the
low and high EGFR expressing group respectively. The
SUVpeak was 3.2±0.6 and 4.7±1.1 respectively, the TBRmean
1.0±0.3 and 1.2±0.3, and the TBRpeak 1.6±0.6 and 1.8±0.5,
where TBRmean and TBRpeak are the SUVmean and SUVpeak
divided by the background uptake. The SUVmean (p < 0.01)
and SUVpeak (p < 0.01) were statistically significantly
different between the low and high EGFR expression
groups, however for the TBRmean (p = 0.315) and TBRpeak
(p = 0.417) no statistically significance was observed. In
the group with a low EGFR expression, 3 out of 7 (42%)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients had a high 89Zr-cetuximab TBR (TBRpeak > 1.4);
in the group with high EGFR expression 7 out of 10 (70%)
patients had high uptake (TBRpeak > 1.4). In Figure 3 the
PET parameters as a function of EGFR IHC scores are
shown.

DISCUSSION
This study analyzed 89Zr-cetuximab PET/CT
imaging at two time-points before radiotherapy treatment,
to determine the optimal timing of 89Zr-cetuximab
imaging, the spatial stability of the 89Zr-cetuximab uptake
patterns, and the uptake in the primary tumor compared to
the lymph nodes to allow future use in treatment selection.
Furthermore, 89Zr-cetuximab uptake was compared with
EGFR expression and metabolic activity as determined by
FDG PET/CT.
The later 89Zr-cetuximab imaging time points were
associated with increased tumor to background ratios in all
patients, therefore, imaging at 6 or 7 days post-injection is
recommended for future studies. This is in agreement with
the results in advanced colorectal cancer [25], where also
6 days post-injection was described as optimal imaging
time point. The imaging time point did not influence
the average peak or maximum uptake; the improvement
in TBR between the time points is due to a decrease in
background activity. The voxel-based comparison between
the two 89Zr-cetuximab scans showed that there is a
correlation for patients with sufficient uptake of the tracer.
The correlation is moderate however, indicating that there
is a minor change in spatial uptake patterns over time.
As anticipated, a large variation in 89Zr-cetuximab

uptake was found between patients. The TBR on the
second scan ranged from the background level (TBR
around 1.0) to a TBR of 2.6 times the background level.
This inter-patient variety could possibly be exploited
and used to select tumors that can be targeted by the
monoclonal antibody to ultimately predict treatment
outcome. However, more research is required to determine
which of the calculated measures (SUVmean, SUVpeak,
SUVmax, TBR) best reflects the accessibility of the drug
to the tumor. To be able to use 89Zr-cetuximab PET/CT
imaging for patient selection, the antibody uptake should
be related to treatment outcome and an appropriate
measure for differentiating the responders and nonresponders should be determined. The studied group of
patients was unfortunately too small and the received
treatments too heterogeneous to link treatment outcome
to 89Zr-cetuximab uptake. A sample of more than 17
seventeen patients is needed to define such a measure.
The exploratory analysis comparing high uptake
regions on the 89Zr-cetuximab PET/CT images with the
high uptake regions on FDG images revealed only minor
overlap (DICE<0.6 for TBR>1.2). A correlation between
the two tracers could be hypothesized given that EGFR
influences proliferation and thereby glucose metabolism.
However, many factors other than EGFR contribute to a
difference in metabolism and studies linking proliferation
to FDG uptake have shown conflicting results [26, 27].
A significant difference in 89Zr-cetuximab SUV
was found between the groups with a high and a low
EGFR expression. The tumors with a high expression
had on average a higher 89Zr-cetuximab SUVmean and
SUVpeak. However, when we compared the TBR between
the two groups, no significant difference was observed.
In tumors lacking EGFR expression, response to the
targeted drug was unexpected, while in tumors with an
EGFR overexpression, the accessibility of the tumor was
hypothesized to be a determining factor in drug uptake.
As expected, in the tumors with high EGFR expression a
mix of low and high 89Zr-cetuximab uptake was observed.
Remarkably, high 89Zr-cetuximab PET uptake was also
observed in the low EGFR expression group; the patient
with the lowest EGFR IHC score had the overall highest
89
Zr-cetuximab TBR. A limitation of this kind of analysis
and a possible explanation for this remarkable result
is that EGFR expression was only determined for one
sample which might not represent the whole tumor [28].
In contrast to a single biopsy, 89Zr-cetuximab imaging can
give a 3D uptake pattern of the entire tumor. Moreover,
the reproducibility of EGFR staining is questionable.
Interobserver variability, differences in tissue fixation
techniques and increased storage time of the samples
could negatively influence reproducibility. For example,
Chung et al. [29] found that cetuximab shows activity
in tumors that do not express EGFR and concluded that
EGFR determined by immunohistochemistry might not
reflect the tumor biology.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A high correlation was observed between the 89Zrcetuximab uptake in the primary tumor and the lymph
nodes. This might indicate that uptake of the drug is
mainly determined by intrinsic characteristics of the
tumor cells. Interestingly, the Bonner trial [6] showed in
an exploratory subgroup analysis an increased benefit for
addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy over radiotherapy
alone for patients with nodal involvement, while there
was no benefit for patients without nodal involvement.
Our data shows that a patient with uptake of cetuximab
in the primary tumor will most likely also have cetuximab
accumulating in the lymph nodes.
A limitation of this study is that different PET
scan settings, e.g. voxel size, slice thickness, scan time
and various PET reconstructions algorithms were used in
the analyzed patients, complicating quantitative analysis
and comparison between patients. After inclusion of the
first patients in this study, Makris et al. [30] published
work highlighting the importance of harmonization of
scan protocols and the suggested scan protocols were
adopted. Thereafter, their recommendations regarding
image analysis were followed to improve the conformity
between scans. For example, scans acquired on a Philips
scanner were additionally smoothed and SUVpeak was used
as measure of tracer uptake since this parameter is less
susceptible to noise.
Other factors that could have influenced the imaging
results are the cold loading dose and the extra margin for
the lymph nodes. A loading dose was used to prevent
all labelled antibody going to the liver. As a proof of
principle, it was shown before that without a loading dose
less than 10% of the injected dose 89Zr-cetuximab was
available in the blood, while after a loading dose of 500
mg/m2 80% of the injected tracer was detected in the blood
and available for tumor targeting [25]. For this study the
recommended therapeutic dose of cetuximab (400 mg/m2)
was used as a loading dose to best represent the clinical
situation and to visualize how much cetuximab would
reach the tumor during treatment. For the lymph nodes
we decided to use the CTV as region of interest. This
additional margin, that was added to compensate for small
registration uncertainties, would influence the SUVmean of
the region. Therefore, only the SUVmax and SUVpeak were
calculated for the lymph nodes. Smaller lymph nodes
might suffer from underestimation of the uptake due to
partial volume effects.
The ARTFORCE trial was designed to select
the most effective treatment, cisplatin or cetuximab,
for individual patients. The original design consisted
of four treatment arms (two with cisplatin and two
with cetuximab) all preceded by an 89Zr-cetuximab
pre-treatment imaging step which was solely used for
research purposes. The use of a long-lived positron emitter
complicated procedures for the radiotherapy departments,
patients were confronted with an extra radiation burden
(0.61 mSv/MBq [31]) and additional guidelines had to be

followed by the patient during two weeks after injection
to limit radiation exposure to others. The resulting slow
accrual in combination with discontinuation of the
funding of cetuximab resulted in an amendment of the
trial excluding 89Zr-cetuximab PET/CT imaging and the
cetuximab treatment arms. The imaging results of all
patients undergoing the 89Zr-cetuximab PET/CT imaging
were presented in this study.
In conclusion, the PET tracer 89Zr-cetuximab showed
a large variation in 89Zr-cetuximab tumor-to-background
ratio between patients. This inter-patient variety could
possibly be exploited and used to select tumors that can
be targeted by the monoclonal antibody to ultimately
predict treatment outcome. 89Zr-cetuximab imaging
provides additional information about the accessibility of
the drug into the tumor which is not provided by FDGPET or EGFR expression. Validation of the predictive
value is recommended with scans acquired 6 to 7 days
post-injection to obtain high tumor to background uptake
levels. For future studies a trial design should be chosen
that incentivizes patients to participate, e.g. by linking
research and therapeutic consequences.

Zr-cetuximab PET/CT image acquisition and
analysis
89

Labelling of cetuximab with Zirconium-89 was
performed as described by Verel et al. [34]. Data on
the quality of the labelling process can be found in the
Supplementary Data. Patients first received an intravenous
loading dose of unlabeled cetuximab of 400 mg/m2
directly followed by 10 mg 89Zirconium labeled cetuximab
of 54.5 MBq (range 29 - 62 MBq). 89Zr-cetuximab PET/
CT images were acquired at 4 and 7 days post-injection
(p.i.), corresponding to day -3 and day 1 of radiotherapy,
to enable imaging of the therapeutic dose. Alternatively,
patients could be scanned on day 3 and 6 p.i. for logistic
reasons. If 89Zr-cetuximab PET/CT imaging and the
first radiotherapy fraction were scheduled on the same
day, the PET scan was always acquired before the start
of radiotherapy. Patients were scanned in radiotherapy
treatment position wearing a personalized radiotherapy
mask on either a Philips Gemini TF 16 PET/CT scanner
(Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) or Siemens
Biograph TruePoint scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions,
Erlangen, Germany). Scans were acquired with a
minimum time per bed position of 3 minutes. The Philips
PET images were reconstructed using an ordered-subsets
time of flight reconstruction technique (BLOB-OS-TF),
with 3 iterations and 33 subsets. The Siemens images
were reconstructed with a point spread function algorithm
(PSF), with either 4 iterations and 14 subsets or 3 iterations
and 21 subsets. One scan was reconstructed using the
2D OSEM algorithm with 4 iterations and 8 subsets.
All scans were corrected for attenuation, scatter and 89Zr
decay. Images acquired with the Philips Gemini PET/CT
system were additionally smoothed with a Gaussian filter
(full width at half maximum of 7 mm) to match the noise
levels of the different scanners, as described by Makris
et al. [30]. The PET/CT images are publicly available at
www.cancerdata.org [37].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection and treatment protocol
Patients with previously untreated, histological
proven stage III-IV, T3-T4 squamous cell carcinoma of the
oropharynx, oral cavity or hypopharynx, were included in
the multi-center clinical ARTFORCE trial (ClinicalTrials.
gov: NCT01504815). The trial was approved by the
appropriate Medical Ethics Review Committee. After
giving written informed consent, patients underwent a
double randomization: 1. standard radiation dose of 70 Gy
or dose-redistribution to the primary tumor to a maximum
of 84 Gy on the FDG-avid area and a dose gradient from
70 to 64 Gy in the remainder of the primary tumor. 2.
Cisplatin or cetuximab concurrently with radiation. The
study protocol is described in detail by Heukelom et
al. [32]. For all treatment arms, pre-treatment imaging
consisted of one FDG PET/CT scan and two 89Zrcetuximab PET/CT scans. The 89Zr-cetuximab PET/CT
scans were solely used for research purposes and did not
influence any clinical decisions.

Tumor delineation
Gross tumor volumes of the primary tumor (GTVprim)
and involved lymph nodes (GTVln) were delineated by
an experienced radiation oncologist during the clinical
radiation treatment planning process and subsequently
propagated to the different scans for further analysis.
The delineations were performed either on a dedicated
planning CT scan or on the pre-treatment FDG PET/CT
scan. In case a dedicated planning CT was acquired, it was
first rigidly registered to the CT scan of the FDG PET/CT
scan and then the contours were propagated to the FDG
PET/CT scan. Thereafter, the CT images of the FDG PET/
CT scan were rigidly registered to the CT images of the

F-FDG PET/CT image acquisition

Pre-treatment FDG PET/CT scans were acquired at
least one day before 89Zr-cetuximab administration using
the standard clinical protocol following EANM guidelines
[33]. All patients were scanned in treatment position: on
a flat table top and immobilized using a personalized
radiotherapy mask with neck rest and with their arms by

Zr-cetuximab PET/CT scans. The tumor delineations
were finally copied onto the 89Zr-cetuximab scan. All
registrations and propagated delineations were visually
checked and no registration difficulties were observed.
The aortic arch was contoured for assessment of unspecific
background uptake of the tracer.

For all patients a pre-treatment biopsy of the
primary tumor was taken, as part of the regular diagnostic
examination. Part of the tumor sample was archived in
a paraffin block, stored and used for EGFR expression
analysis. The archived samples were obtained from
the Maastricht Pathology Tissue Collection (MPTC)
and NKI-AVL Core Facility Molecular Pathology &
Biobanking (CFMPB). Collection, storage and use of
tissue and patient data were performed in agreement with
the “Code for Proper Secondary Use of Human Tissue
in the Netherlands”. The EGFR expression assessment
was performed with an EGFR pharmDx qualitative
immunohistochemical kit, consisting of two antibodies
(Novocastra and Dako, Denmark). All samples were
analyzed on the same day in the same lab. EGFR staining
intensity was analyzed using a light microscope. The
percentages of cells with weak, moderate and strong
membranous EGFR staining were scored. An EGFR
immunohistochemistry (IHC) score, between 0-300, was
calculated according to the formula: EGFR IHC score
= 1 x (% cells weak staining) + 2 x (% cells moderate
staining) + 3 x (% cells strong staining) [35]. Tumors with
an IHC score < 200 were classified as having a low EGFR
expression; tumors with an IHC score ≥ 200 as high EGFR
expression. This division was based on results of the
FLEX study [36]. The EGFR expression was correlated to
the 89Zr-cetuximab imaging parameters and the EGFR low
and EGFR high expression group were compared.

Quantification of PET tracer uptake
PET/CT images were analyzed using in-house
developed Matlab-based software (The MathWorks
Inc., Natick, MA). For the FDG PET/CT scan and 89Zrcetuximab PET/CT scans, tracer uptake was quantified
using standardized uptake values (SUV) normalized to
body weight. The mean uptake (SUVmean), maximum
uptake (SUVmax), and peak uptake (SUVpeak) were assessed
inside the delineated tumor sites, where SUVpeak is defined
as the mean SUV in a 3D sphere with a diameter of 1.2 cm
centered at the tumor location with the highest activity.
For the primary tumor, the GTV was used as region of
interest. For the smaller lymph nodes, the clinical target
volume (CTVln) was used as region of interest, which
consisted of an isotropic 5 mm extension of the GTVln.
SUVmax and SUVpeak were calculated for the lymph nodes.
Furthermore, the average uptake in the aortic arch was
calculated and the tumor-to-background ratio (TBR), as
defined as SUVpeak tumor divided by SUVmean aorta, was
determined.
We evaluated which time point after 89Zr-cetuximab
administration resulted in the largest contrast between
tumor and background activity by comparing TBR values
for the GTVprim between the first and second scan, to
determine the optimal scan time point.
The stability of the 89Zr-cetuximab uptake patterns
were compared between the two scans. The second scan
was registered to the first scan using a rigid registration
and the GTV contours of the primary tumors were copied
from the planning CT to the first 89Zr-cetuximab scan. All
registrations were visually checked and no registration
problems were observed. A voxel-based correlation
between the SUV values of the two scans was calculated.
Finally, 89Zr-cetuximab images were compared to
FDG PET/CT images. The peak 89Zr-cetuximab uptake and
peak FDG uptake for the primary tumor were compared.
In addition, the location of the high uptake regions on the
89
Zr-cetuximab and FDG PET/CT scans were compared.
For both the first and second 89Zr-cetuximab scan, high
uptake regions were defined as the volume with a TBR
above 1.2 or 1.4. Two cut-off values were used because
it is still not well defined which cut-off value qualifies
as high uptake. For the FDG PET/CT scans voxels with
a SUV above 50% of the SUVmax were defined as high
uptake region. The overlap between the different volumes
was assessed using a DICE similarity score, defined as
twice the intersecting volume divided by the sum of both
volumes.

Statistics
To evaluate the optimal time point for 89Zrcetuximab imaging, the TBR of the primary tumor on
the first and second scan were compared using a paired
student t-test. Additionally, the Pearson correlation
coefficient was used to calculate the correlation between
the 89Zr-cetuximab TBR in the primary tumor and lymph
nodes, to determine the spatial stability between the two
89
Zr-cetuximab scans, and to determine the correlation
between 89Zr-cetuximab and FDG peak uptake in the
primary tumor. A Mann-Whitney U exact test was used to
assess the 89Zr-cetuximab parameters between the EGFR
high and low uptake groups. Results are presented as
mean ± one standard deviation and p-values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
