ABSTRACT
PI3Kδ is predominately expressed in leukocytes and has been found
overexpressed in B-cell related malignances such as CLL and AML. We have discovered
a highly selective ATP competitive PI3Kd inhibitor PI3KD-IN-015, which exhibits a
high selectivity among other PI3K isoforms in both biochemical assays and cellular
assay, meanwhile did not inhibit most of other protein kinases in the kinome. PI3KDIN-015 demonstrates moderately anti-proliferation efficacies against a variety of
B-cell related cancer cell lines through down-regulate the PI3K signaling significantly.
It induced both apoptosis and autophagy in B-cell malignant cell lines. In addition,
combination of autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin could potentiate the moderate antiproliferation effect of PI3KD-IN-015. PI3KD-IN-015 shows anti-proliferation efficacy
against CLL and AML patient primary cells. Collectively, these results indicate that
PI3KD-IN-015 may be useful drug candidate for further development of anti-B-cell
related malignances therapies.

all of the mammalian tissues, PI3Kδ and g are predominately
expressed in the lymphocytes, and has been proved to be
essential for B-cell survival, proliferation, and migration
[4, 5].Among these, PI3Kδ is specifically over-expressed/
aberrantly activated in a variety of B-cell malignances
such as CLL and AML [6, 7]. Therefore, PI3Kδ has been
extensively studied as a therapeutic target in hematologic
malignancies. Currently there are several PI3Kδ inhibitors in
different stages of clinical development including AMG319
(phase I), GSK2269557 (Phase II), INCB040093 (phase I),

INTRODUCTION
Mammalian PI3K lipid kinases are composed of three
classes – I, II, and III, which are involved in multiple cellular
functions, including signaling transduction, cell proliferation,
differentiation, etc. [1] Constitutive activation or overexpressions of PI3Ks have been implicated in variety of
human cancers [2]. Among these, class I PI3K lipid kinases
consist of four different catalytic isoforms including PI3Kα, β,
δ and γ [3]. While PI3Ka and b are ubiquitously expressed in

TGR-1202 (phase I), UCB-5857 (phase I) and CAL-101
(Idelalisib, approved [8]) which is the first selective PI3Kδ
inhibitor approved by US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma(FL) and relapsed
small lymphocytic lymphoma(SLL) [9–11]. Here we report
the discovery of another potent and selective PI3Kδ inhibitor,
PI3KD-IN-015, which exhibits potent and selective inhibitory
effects against the PI3Kδ-mediated signaling pathway and the
proliferation of both established cancer cell lines and primary
CLL and AML patient cells.

RESULTS

four PI3K isoforms with submicromolar IC50s though it
also exhibited the relative selectivity to PI3Kδ (EC50 of 4.3
nM over 624 nM, 176 nM and 129 nM against α, β and γ
isoform) [12]. (Figure 1C and Table 2)
To further characterize the selectivity profile of
PI3KD-IN-015 in the kinome wide range, we next performed
kinome selectivity analysis on PI3KD-IN-015 using
DiscoveRx’s KinomeScanTM technology [13]. PI3KD-IN-015
did not target any other protein kinases except for a few lipid
kinases, including isoforms and mutants of PI3K and PI4K
at a concentration of 1mM. (Figure 1D and Supplementary
Table S1) Collectively, these results indicated that PI3KDIN-015 was a potent and selective PI3Kδ inhibitor.

PI3KD-IN-015 is a potent and selective inhibitor
of PI3Kδ

Structural basis for PI3KD-IN-015’s selectivity
among PI3K isoforms

Starting from an aminothiazole scaffold, with
the structure guided drug design approach, the focused
medicinal chemistry efforts lead us to identify a PI3Kδ
inhibitor PI3KD-IN-015 (Chemical structure shown in
Figure 1A). The ADP-glo biochemical assay with purified
enzymes demonstrated that among class I PI3K kinases
PI3KD-IN-015 inhibited PI3Kδ with a IC50 of 5 nM,
meanwhile it exhibited 12 fold selectivity against PI3Kβ
PI3Kα (IC50: 60 nM), 20 fold selectivity against PI3Kβ
(IC50: 100 nM), and 25-fold selectivity against PI3Kγ
(IC50: 125 nM). It did not show apparent activity against
class II PI3Ks PIK3C2A and PIK3C2B (IC50 over 10mM)
and showed 56-fold selectivity against Class III kinase
Vps34 (IC50: 280 nM). In addition, PI3KD-IN-015 did not
inhibit PI4KA (IC50 over 10mM) and exhibited 34-fold
selectivity against PI4KB (IC50: 172 nM). (Figure 1B)
Its selectivity profile was better than pan-PI3K inhibitor
GDC-0941 but less than well-established PI3Kδ inhibitor
CAL-101 in general. (Table 1) However, it displayed better
selectivity profile than CAL-101 between PI3Kδ and PI3Kγ.
In order to further confirm the selectivity of PI3KD-IN-015
among the class I PI3Ks, we then looked at the cellular
effects of PI3K-IN-015 on PI3K signaling pathway. The
catalytic activity of PI3Kδ triggers the signal transduction
cascades mediated by Akt, and the phosphorylation of Thr308 residue on the activation loop of Akt kinase domain is
often used as a marker for Akt activation. After each PI3K
isoform is individually activated by different stimulating
reagents, addition of PI3K-IN-015 specifically inhibited
PI3Kδ-mediated Akt phosphorylation at T308 residue inRaji
cells stimulated by anti-IgM with IC50 at 13 nM, but it did
not showed apparent inhibitory effect on Akt activation
controlled by the other three class I PI3K isoforms (α, β
and γ: EC50 over 3mM). (Figure 1C and Table 1) The wellestablished PI3Kδ specific inhibitor, CAL-101, showed
similar effects as PI3KD-IN-015 with an EC50 of 2.3
nM against PI3Kδ and over 1000-fold less potent against
the other three isoforms. While the pan-PI3K inhibitor,
GDC-0941, inhibited Akt phosphorylation induced by all

In order to further understand the binding mode of
PI3KD-IN-015 with PI3Kδ, we first studied the binding
kinetics of it. The in vitro ATP-competitive assay on PI3Kδ
demonstrated that PI3KD-IN-015 was an ATP competitive
inhibitor. (Figure 2A) We then docked the inhibitor into PI3Kδ
homology-model structure (template: PDB ID: 2WXF) and
the result showed that PI3KD-IN-015 formed two hydrogen
bonds in the hinge binding area with Val828 via N- and NHon the aminothiazole scaffold. (Figure 2B) The NH2- on
Valine moiety of PI3KD-IN-015 formed a hydrogen bond
with Ser831 near the hinge binding area. In addition, the Oon the sulfonamide moiety formed a hydrogen bond with
Lys779 in the inner hydrophobic pocket. To better understand
the selectivity among the different class I PI3K isoforms, we
further docked PI3KD-IN-015 into structures of PI3Kα (PDB
ID:4JPS), β(homology-model, template: PDB ID:2Y3A)
γ(PDB ID:4WWO) and VPS34 (PDB: ID3LS8) individually
and superimposed them together. (Figure 2C) Detailed analysis
of those four isoforms’ highly similar sequences, we found that
in the hinge binding area (828-832 corresponding to PI3Kδ)
the amino acids residues exhibited difference and this may
explain the selectivity among these isoforms. (Figure 2D)

PI3KD-IN-015 blocks PI3Kδ mediated
downstream signaling pathways
We next investigated the effects of PI3KD-IN-015
on PI3K mediated downstream signaling in various B-cell
malignant cell lines. The results showed that PI3KDIN-015 potently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt at
both Thr308 and Ser473 sites, the downstream target of
PI3K, among MOLM-13 (AML), HT (B-NHL), Namalwa
(Burkitt Lymphoma), MEC-1 (CLL), MEC-2 (CLL), and
HS505T (CLL) cells, with EC50 less than 1 μM (Figure 3).
In addition, the substrates of Akt, such as PRAS40 GSK3b
and FOXO1, also exhibited decreased phosphorylation. The
AKT downstream signaling mediator mTOR’s substrates
S6K phosphorylation was also significantly decreased at
1mM in MOLM13, HT, Namalwa, MEC-1, MEC-2 cells but

PI3KD-IN-015 exhibits anti-proliferative activity
against B-cell related cancer cell lines

not in HS505T cells. Interestingly, the other well established
mTOR’s substrate 4EBP1’s phosphorylation was not changed
at all in all of the cell lines which further confirmed that
PI3KD-IN-015 has no direct inhibitory effect against mTOR
kinase though it is structurally very similar to PI3Ks. In
addition, NF-kB P65 phosphorylation was not inhibited in any
of these tested cell lines with PI3KD-IN-015 treatment. Erk
phosphorylation was reduced upon PI3KD-IN-015 treatment
in Namalwa, MEC-1, MEC-2 and HS505T cells but not
in MOLM13 and HT, as what CAL-101 did. Collectively
these data illustrated that PI3KD-IN-015 is a potent PI3Kδ
inhibitor in cellular context, as what CAL-101 did, but their
pharmacological profile may be slightly different.

We next screened PI3KD-IN-015 against a panel of
cancer cell lines derived from B-cell malignancies. The
results showed that PI3KD-IN-015 exhibited moderate antiproliferative effects against most of the cell lines including
AML, B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell lines
with GI50 between 1-10 μM but did not exhibit apparent
inhibitory activity against CLL cell lines. (Table 3) CAL101 did not exhibit apparent inhibitory activity against
most of the cell lines tested except the AML cell line OCIAML-3, MOLM14 and mantle cell lymphoma cell REC-1.

In contrast, the pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 significantly
inhibited the cell growth in most of the cell lines. However,
none of the three inhibitors, PI3KD-IN-015, CAL-101 and
GDC-0941, displayed anti-proliferative effects against
three CLL cell lines tested (HS505T, MEC-1 and MEC2), This is consistent with the previous report that PI3Kδ
inhibitors do not show strong direct inhibition on cell
growth, but rather alter microenvironment and indirectly
inhibit cell proliferation in CLL patients.[14]
To further examine the anti-growth efficacy of
PI3KD-IN-015, we then performed the clonogenic assays
using HT (B-NHL), MEC-1 (CLL) and MOLM13 (AML).
Interestingly, PI3KD-IN-015 displayed strong anti-colony
formation activity in all of the 3 cell lines (HT: EC50: 374
nM), MEC-1: EC50: 765 nM and MOLM13: EC50: 215 nM).
(Supplememtary Figure S1) This is interesting that since for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the CLL cell MEC-1, PI3KD-IN-015 has no direct effect on
its proliferation (over 10 μM, Table 2) but can strongly inhibit
the colony formation. This may further confirm the clinically
observed results from CAL-101 that PI3Kδ inhibitor has little
direct cytotoxic effect against CLL cells but may indirectly
inhibit its proliferation through the microenvironment [14].

PI3KD-IN-015 induces apoptosis and autophagy
in B-cell related cancer cell lines
PI3KD-IN-015 induced apparent PARP cleavage in
MOLM-13 cell (AML), HT cell (B-NHL), but only weakly
in MEC-1 cell (CLL) within 12 hours. (Figure 4A) Similar
trend was observed for the reported pan-PI3K inhibitor
GDC-0941.Because of the close involvement of PI3K/Atk/
mTOR pathway in autophagy, we also examined whether
32646

Oncotarget

PI3KD-IN-015 has any effect in autophagy induction.
In MOLM-13 cell, which has been observed for obvious
apoptosis, no apparent autophagy induction was observed.
(Figure 4B) While in both HT cells and MEC-1 cells,
treatment of PI3KD-IN-015 significantly increased the
production of LC3B II, indicating that PI3KD-IN-015 can
induce autophagy, probably through its activity against
PI3Kδ. As a positive control, mTOR inhibitor, AZD8055
also showed a similar autophagy inducing effect. Given
the fact that autophagy is often used by cancer cells as a
protective mechanism, we then tried to combine PI3KDIN-015 with autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin in HT cells

and MEC-1 cells. The result showed that Bafilomycin could
synergistically potentiate PI3KD-IN-015’s anti-proliferative
efficacy in HT and MEC-1 cells. (Figure 4C, 4D)

PI3KD-IN-015 inhibits the proliferation of
primary CLL and AML patient cells
We then investigated PI3KD-IN-015’s effect on
patient primary cells. The result showed that, PI3KDIN-015 effectively suppressed the growth of 2 of 3 CLL
primary cells and was effective against most of AML
patient cells with GI50 less than 10 μM (Table 4 and

this indicated that PI3KD-IN-015 might bear different
pharmacological profile with CAL-101.

not show too much efficacy against most of these cell
lines in our testing. But, the PI3KD-IN-015 has displayed
moderate anti-proliferative activities against most of the
AML, MM, and B-cell lymphoma cell lines indicating
that these two drugs may bear different pharmacological
profiles besides the PI3Kδ.
In summary, we report here the discovery of a
new highly potent and selective PI3Kδ inhibitor PI3KDIN-015 that potently inhibits PI3Kδ mediated signaling
pathway, induces apoptosis and autophagy in AML/CLL
cell lines and inhibits the proliferation of CLL and AML
patient primary cells. PI3KD-IN-015 might serve as a
supplementary to the armory to fight the PI3Kδ mediated
B-cell malignances.

DISCUSSION
The seminal discovery of the highly selective
PI3Kδ inhibitor CAL-101 (Idelalisib) has opened a new
scenario in the CLL clinical treatment. However, both
the preclinical and clinical observation have confirmed
that unlike other target therapies, which will show
direct cytotoxicity against the cancer cell itself directly,
inhibition of PI3Kδ itself only exhibits limited cytotoxicity
against the cancer cells. Rather it majorly exert its
antagonizing cell survival efficacy through interfering the
microenvironment, such as by blocking the production of
cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-6, etc, that will prevent
the leukemia cells from circulating back to the lymph
nodes and bone marrow for the further proliferation [14].
In order to improve the clinical efficacy, combination of
other chemotherapies and signaling pathway inhibitors
have been suggested and tested in the clinical trials
[15]. Here both our newly discovered selective PI3Kδ
inhibitor PI3KD-IN-015 and CAL-101 proved again that
in the CLL cell lines they did not exhibit any apparent
anti-proliferative efficacies in vitro. Interestingly, we
found that treatment of CLL cell lines induced autophagy,
which might provide a pro-survival mechanism for
overcoming the cytotoxicity effect of the compound.
The roles of autophagy in hematologic malignancies are
still controversial, as it may promote either cell survival
or cell death. The enhanced anti-proliferative efficacy
by combination of autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin has
provided an alternative approach to improve the antileukemic efficacy of PI3Kδ inhibitors.
Interestingly, despite of the overexpression of PI3Kδ
has been reported in the AML and B-NHL, CAL-101 did

a luminescence signal. Luminescence signal was measured
with an automated plate reader (Perkin-Elmer Envision) and
each measurement was performed in triplicate.

was used as the bottom agar in a 6-well plate. 1000 cells
in 1.8 mL growth media was combined with 0.2 mL of
3% agarose solution and 2 μL serially diluted PI3KDIN-015, then plated on top of the bottom layer. Cells were
maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for
15 days. On the 15th day, the numbers of colonies in each
well were counted and each measurement was performed
in triplicate.

Kinase kinetic assay
Kinetic analyses of PI3KCD were performed using
a luminometric kinase assay varying the concentration of
ATP using the ADP-Glo reagents (Promega). The serially
diluted PI3KD-IN-015 and PI3KCD (2.2 μg/mL) were
assayed in a reaction (10 μL) containing 50 mM HEPES
(pH 7.5), 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl2,
0.03% CHAPS. After 60 min incubation at RT, varied
concentrations of ATP, 0.1mM substrate PIP2:PS were
added and incubated for 60 min at 37° C. The overall rate
of reaction was determined as the slope of the decreasing
phase of the reaction. Each data point was collected in
duplicate and kinetic parameters were obtained using
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Signaling pathway effect examination
MOLM13, HT, MEC-1, MEC-2 cells were cultured
in 10% FBS-containing RPMI and HS505T cells were
cultured in 10% FBS-containing DMEM medium. The
serially diluted PI3KD-IN-015 was added to cells for 1
hour. The cells were collected and lysed, and cell lysates
were analyzed by western blotting.

Apoptosis
MOLM13, HT, MEC-1 cells were cultured in
10% FBS-containing RPMI medium. The serially
diluted PI3KD-IN-015 was added to cells for 12
hours. Then, apoptosis of MOLM13, HT, MEC-1 cells
were detected by western-blot using PARP, GAPDH
antibody (CST).

PI3Ks isoform in cell EC50 assay
Raji cell was cultured in 10% FBS-containing RPMI
and NIH-3T3, RAW264.7 macrophages cells were cultured
in 10% FBS-containing DMEM medium. For selectivity
against PI3K α, β, γ, δ isoforms, NIH-3T3, NIH-3T3,
RAW264.7 macrophages and Raji cells were seeded in a
6-well tissue culture plate and starved for 24 hours, then
incubated with compounds at the desired concentrations
for 1 hour followed by 20ng/ml PDGF-BB for 10min, 5μM
LPA for 10min, 50ng/ml c5a for 5min, 1μg/ml anti-IgM
for 10min. Cells were lysed and AKT phosphorylation was
determined by Western Blotting. Intensity of the bands
was determined using ImageJ 1.42q (NIH, USA) and
normalized to total AKT (loading control).

Autophagy
MOLM13, HT, MEC-1 cells were treated with
serially diluted PI3KD-IN-015 for 12 hours. Cells were
then washed in PBS and lysed in cell lysis buffer and
detected by western-blot using LC3B, GAPDH antibody
(Cell signaling Technology).
