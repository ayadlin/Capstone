BACKGROUND. Exercise training improves supportive care outcomes in patients
with breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant therapy, but the responses are heterogeneous. In this study, the authors examined personal and clinical factors that
may predict exercise training responses.

METHODS. Breast cancer patients who were initiating adjuvant chemotherapy
(N 5 242) were assigned randomly to receive usual care (UC) (n 5 82), resistance
exercise training (RET) (n 5 82), or aerobic exercise training (AET) (n 5 78) for
the duration of chemotherapy. Endpoints were quality of life (QoL), aerobic fitness, muscular strength, lean body mass, and body fat. Moderators were patient
preference for group assignment, marital status, age, disease stage, and chemotherapy regimen.
RESULTS. Adjusted linear mixed-model analyses demonstrated that patient preference moderated QoL response (P 5 .005). Patients who preferred RET improved

explained by differences in adherence.

moderated the effects of exercise training in breast cancer patients who were
receiving chemotherapy. If replicated, these results may inform clinical practice.

changes in quality of life (QoL),1 physical functioning,2 and body

may improve these outcomes. Similar to virtually all exercise trials,7
there was significant heterogeneity in the exercise training responses

Training (START).6 In this report, we describe the
effects of moderators on the main outcomes of the
START trial.
Clinical trial experts have recommended that
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) should conduct
and report subgroup analyses.8,9 Properly conducted
subgroup analysis can provide important information
to guide the next generation of research studies and
to inform clinical practice.9 Moderators specify for
whom or under what conditions the interventions
work. Known moderators can influence eligibility criteria and stratification decisions to maximize power
in subsequent RCTs and can suggest to clinicians
which of their patients may benefit the most from a
given intervention. Previous RCTs of exercise in cancer patients have been too small to test properly for
moderators.4,10 Some trials have presented stratified
subgroup analysis11,12 but have not conducted a formal test of the interaction as recommended by statisticians.8,9,13 Other trials have conducted formal tests
of interactions but have had limited power14–17 or
have examined only baseline functioning scores.18
In this report, we examine moderators from the
START trial to determine whether selected subgroups
of breast cancer patients responded differently to an
aerobic or resistance exercise intervention. Our primary prespecified moderator was patient preference
for group assignment. Patient preference is a potentially important but often ignored factor in unblinded
trials.19 Participants assigned to their nonpreferred
intervention may suffer ‘‘resentful demoralization,’’
resulting in lower adherence or a negative psychosocial response to the intervention.19 Participants
assigned to their preferred intervention may have
higher expectations of benefit (ie, a placebo effect),
or they may be matched better to the intervention.19
To our knowledge, few exercise RCTs have examined
patient preference effects in any population.20,21 We
hypothesized that participants who were assigned to
their preferred exercise group would report greater
improvements in QoL. Our secondary moderators
were marital status, age, disease stage, and chemotherapy regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Setting and Participants
Detailed methods of our trial have been reported
elsewhere.6 Here, we briefly summarize these methods with additional attention to our selected moderators. Participants were recruited from the Cross
Cancer Institute in Edmonton, the Ottawa Hospital
Integrated Cancer Program, and the British Columbia
Cancer Agency in Vancouver. Ethical approval was

obtained from each center, and participants provided
informed consent. Eligibility criteria included English- or French-speaking women aged 18 years with
stage I through IIIA breast cancer who were initiating
adjuvant chemotherapy. Women were excluded if
they had undergone incomplete axillary surgery or
transabdominal rectus abdominus muscle reconstructive surgery, if they had uncontrolled illnesses,
or if they were not approved by their oncologist.
Baseline physical activity or body mass index were
not eligibility criteria.

Design and Procedures
The study was a prospective, 3-armed, RCT. Eligible
participants were identified by their treating oncologist and, if they were interested, completed a questionnaire, physical fitness tests, and dual x-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) scans (which were added after
the first 23 participants were randomized).
Randomization
Participants were stratified by center and chemotherapy regimen (taxane-based vs nontaxane-based) and
were assigned randomly to aerobic exercise training
(AET), resistance exercise training (RET), or usual
care (UC) by using a computer-generated program.
Allocation sequence was generated in Edmonton and
was concealed from the project directors who
assigned participants to groups.
Exercise Training Interventions
Participants assigned to AET or RET were asked to
exercise 3 times per week for the duration of their
chemotherapy. The AET group exercised on a cycle
ergometer, treadmill, or elliptical beginning at 60% of
their peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) for 15 minutes
and progressing to 80% of their VO2peak for 45 minutes. The RET group completed 2 sets of 8–12 repetitions of 9 different exercises at 60%–70% of their
estimated 1 repetition maximum (RM) with prespecified weight progression. The UC group was asked not
to start exercise training but were offered a 1-month
supervised program after postintervention assessments.
Assessment of Endpoints Included in the
Moderator Analyses
Our primary endpoint for the trial was QoL. Secondary endpoints were aerobic fitness, muscular
strength, lean body mass, and percent body fat. All
baseline assessments were completed within 1 to 2
weeks after the first cycle of chemotherapy. QoL was
assessed again at midpoint (the middle of chemotherapy) and postintervention (3–4 weeks after chem-

otherapy), whereas physical fitness and body composition were assessed again at postintervention only.
QoL was measured by using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) scale,22
which was selected because of its focus on fatigue
and anemia symptoms. Aerobic fitness was evaluated
by using a maximal incremental exercise protocol on
a treadmill.23 Upper body muscular strength was
assessed by a predicted 1-RM equation using an 8RM horizontal bench press.24 We selected upper
body strength over lower body strength because it
provided a cleaner comparison between RET and
AET. A DXA scan assessed lean body mass and percent body fat using the Hologic QDR-4500 in Vancouver and the General Electric Lunar Expert in
Ottawa and Edmonton.

Assessment of Moderators
Demographic data were collected by self-report, and
medical data were abstracted from records. Patient
preference for group assignment was assessed in the
baseline questionnaire before randomization with
the following question: ‘‘Which exercise program
would you prefer if you had the choice?’’ Options
were aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or no preference. Marital status was divided into ‘‘married’’
(married, common law) versus ‘‘unmarried’’ (never
married, separated, widowed, divorced). Age was divided into <50 years versus 50 years based on a
roughly median split. Chemotherapy regimens were
grouped as taxane-based versus nontaxane-based
therapies on the basis of the higher toxicity rates of
taxanes.25,26 Disease stage was divided into stages I
and IIA (lymph node negative) versus stages IIB and
IIIA (primarily lymph node positive).
Statistical Analyses
We used linear mixed-model analysis to assess effect
modification of the interventions by each hypothesized moderator in the form of an interaction test.27
Each outcome measure taken at 3 time points (QoL)
or at 2 time points (objective outcomes) was modeled to compare changes over time across intervention-moderator groups. Our primary analysis was
adjusted for baseline value of the outcome, age, marital status, employment status, disease stage, type of
chemotherapy, baseline exercise, and smoking status
using baseline propensity scores.28 For all analyses,
we used the intention-to-treat principle. Available
data for participants with missing data were included
under the missing at random assumption of the
mixed-model analysis. We examined patient preference and marital status for QoL only because there
was no biologic plausibility for how these moderators

might affect objective responses to exercise training.
Age, chemotherapy regimen, and disease stage were
examined for all 5 endpoints. This strategy resulted
in 16 secondary tests of interactions. No adjustment
was made for multiple secondary comparisons,
because these analyses were considered hypothesisgenerating rather than hypothesis-testing.13

RESULTS
The flow of participants through the trial has been
reported elsewhere.6 Briefly, we recruited 242 of 736
eligible participants (33%) and obtained follow-up
data on >90% of participants for all endpoints. The
groups were balanced at baseline,6 including the
moderators tested in the current study (Table 1). The
median length of the exercise intervention was 17
weeks (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 9 to 24
weeks), and adherence was 72.0% and 68.2% in the
AET and RET groups, respectively (P 5 .411).

Moderators of QoL Response
Patient preference moderated the effects of exercise
training on QoL (P for interaction 5 .005). In stratified subgroup analyses (Table 2), breast cancer
patients who preferred RET increased QoL by 11.9
points when they were assigned to RET compared
with an increase of 0.3 points when they were
assigned to AET (adjusted mean difference 5 11
points; 95% CI, 21.1 to 23.4 points; P 5 .076) and a

decrease of 4.9 points when they were assigned to
UC (adjusted mean difference 5 16.5 points; 95% CI,
4.3–28.7 points; P 5 .008). For breast cancer patients
who had no preference, QoL increased by 19.6 points
when they were assigned to AET compared with a
decrease of 3.9 points when they were assigned to
RET (adjusted mean difference 5 23 points; 95% CI,
4.9–41 points; P 5 .014). For breast cancer patients
who preferred AET, no differences in QoL responses
to exercise training were observed. Adherence to RET
was 69.8%, 66.6%, and 69.1% among those who preferred AET, preferred RET, and had no preference,
respectively (P 5 .905). Adherence to AET was 75.8%,
74.2%, and 59.5% among those who preferred AET,
preferred RET, and had no preference, respectively
(P 5 .198).
Marital status also moderated the effects of exercise training on QoL (P for interaction 5 .026). In
stratified subgroup analyses (Table 3), unmarried
breast cancer patients decreased QoL by 10.8 points
when they were assigned to UC compared with an
increase of 2.4 points when they were assigned to
RET (adjusted mean difference 5 13.5 points; 95%
CI, 1.2–25.9 points; P 5 .032) and an increase of 5.7
points when they were assigned to AET (adjusted
mean difference 5 17.7 points; 95% CI, 4.1–31.3
points; P 5 .012). For married breast cancer patients,
no differences in QoL responses to exercise training
were observed. Adherence to RET was 68.7% and
67.8% in unmarried and married participants,
respectively (P 5 .893). Adherence to AET was 75.9%

and 70.5% in unmarried and married participants,
respectively (P 5 .482).

Moderators of Physical Fitness Response
Age moderated the effects of exercise training on aerobic fitness (P for interaction 5 .029). In stratified
subgroup analyses (Table 4), breast cancer patients
aged <50 years increased VO2peak by 1.0 mL/kg per
minute in the AET group compared with a decrease
of 2.4 mL/kg per minute in the UC group (adjusted
mean difference 5 3.4 mL/kg per minute; 95% CI,
1.5–5.4 mL/kg per minute; P < .001). For breast cancer patients aged 50 years, no differences in VO2peak
response to exercise training were observed. Adherence to AET was 71.8% in the group aged < 50 years
and 72.4% in the group aged 50 years (P 5 .725).
Chemotherapy regimen moderated the effects of
exercise training on muscular strength (P for interaction 5 .009). In stratified subgroup analyses (Table
4), breast cancer patients who were receiving nontaxane-based chemotherapies increased muscular
strength by 10.3 kg in the RET group compared with
1.0 kg in the UC group (adjusted mean
difference 5 9.4 kg; 95% CI, 6.8–12.1 kg; P < .001)
and by 2 kg in the AET group (adjusted mean
difference 5 8.7 kg; 95% CI, 6.1–11.4 kg; P < .001).
For breast cancer patients who were receiving taxane-based chemotherapies, muscular strength
increased by 5.1 kg in the RET group compared with
2.0 kg in the UC group (adjusted mean
difference 5 3.8 kg; 95% CI, 20 to 7.7 kg; P 5 .050).

Moderators of Body Composition Response
Disease stage moderated the effects of exercise training on lean body mass (P for interaction, < .001). In
stratified subgroup analyses (Table 5), breast cancer

patients with stage IIB/IIIA disease increased lean
body mass by 2.6 kg in the RET group compared
with a decrease of 0.3 kg in the UC group (adjusted
mean difference 5 3.3 kg; 95% CI, 2.1–4.5 kg;
P < .001). For breast cancer patients with stage I/IIA
disease, no differences in lean body mass responses
to exercise training were observed. Disease stage also

was a borderline moderator of the effects of exercise
training on percent body fat (P for interaction 5 .059). In stratified subgroup analyses (Table
5), breast cancer patients with stage IIB/IIIA disease
increased their percent body fat by 1% in the UC
group compared with a decrease of 1.4% in the RET
group (adjusted mean difference, 22.5%; 95% CI,
24.5% to 20.4% P 5 .019) and a decrease of 1% in
the AET group (adjusted mean difference, 22%; 95%
CI, 23.8% to 20.2% P 5 .034). For breast cancer
patients with stage I/IIA disease, no differences in
percent body fat response to training were observed.
Adherence to RET was 67% in the group with stage I/
IIA disease and 75.1% in the group with stage IIB/
IIIA disease (P 5 .290). Adherence to AET was 71% in
the stage I/IIA group and 81.5% in the stage IIB/IIIA
group (P 5 .084).

DISCUSSION
The primary finding of our study is that patient preference moderated the effects of exercise training on
QoL. In the overall trial analysis,6 both exercise training interventions resulted in nonsignificant improvements in QoL of 4 to 5 points compared with UC. In
our moderator analysis, breast cancer patients who
preferred RET improved QoL by 11 to 17 points

when they were assigned to RET compared with
assignment to UC or AET. Conversely, patients who
had no preference improved QoL by 12 to 23 points
when they were assigned to AET compared with
assignment to UC or RET. These differences in QoL
responses are meaningful and are approximately 2to 3-fold the minimally important difference on the
FACT-An scale of 7 points.22 Two previous exercise
trials have reported no effects of patient preference
on 1) neck pain when comparing usual physiotherapy with brief physiotherapy21 and 2) back pain
when comparing an exercise program with usual
care.20 Our data do not appear to support the ‘‘nonadherence’’ hypothesis, because adherence was similar across the preference groups.
It is unclear why the patient preference effect in
our trial was present for RET but not for AET. It is
possible that a preference for RET is more stable,
because it likely is based on direct experience with
both RET and AET. Preferences based on a lack of experience are more likely to change over the course of
an intervention.19 It also is possible that participants
who preferred RET had stronger preferences than
participants who preferred AET. Slight preferences
may have minimal impact on outcomes, whereas
strong preferences may have substantive effects on

Exercise Effect Moderators in Breast CA/Courneya et al.

outcomes.19 Unfortunately, we did not obtain a measure of preference strength in our study or a measure
of change in preference over time. The finding that
breast cancer patients who had no preference
reported greater improvements in QoL from AET is
interesting and requires replication.
Marital status also moderated the QoL response
to exercise training. Unmarried breast cancer
patients improved QoL with exercise training by 14
to 18 points compared with UC. Married breast cancer patients did not improve QoL with exercise training. To our knowledge, no previous exercise RCT in
cancer patients has examined marital status as a
potential moderator of the QoL response. The effect
does not appear to be explained by differences in
exercise adherence. One possible explanation is that
unmarried patients may have less social support
than married patients.29 Research on psychosocial
interventions has indicated that breast cancer
patients with the least support tend to benefit the
most from psychosocial interventions.30 Although
our exercise interventions were not group-based,
there was formal interaction with the exercise trainers and among participants. Moreover, the QoL
measure we used contained items related to emotional and social well being that could be influenced
by positive social interaction.
Age moderated the effects of exercise training on
aerobic fitness. In the overall trial,6 AET blunted a
decline in VO2peak of approximately 2 mL/mg/kg
(7%). In our moderator analysis, breast cancer
patients aged <50 years obtained a robust benefit of
3.4 mL/kg per minute (13%) compared with no benefit among older patients. To our knowledge, no previous exercise RCT in cancer patients has examined
the moderating effects of age on aerobic fitness
response during adjuvant therapy. In the postadjuvant setting, Courneya et al.15 reported no effects of
age (<60 years vs 60 years) on aerobic fitness gains
in 52 breast cancer survivors, consistent with the
general literature.7 Once again, adherence differences
do not appear to explain this effect. It is possible
that younger patients in the AET group experienced
fewer side effects from chemotherapy and/or pushed
themselves harder than older patients and progressed more rapidly with the exercise prescription.
Chemotherapy regimen moderated the effects of
exercise training on muscular strength. In the overall
trial analysis,6 RET increased muscular strength by
approximately 35%. In our moderator analysis, breast
cancer patients who were receiving nontaxane-based
chemotherapies achieved a 40% improvement compared with an approximately 15% improvement in
patients who were receiving taxane-based che-

1851

motherapies. No previous RCTs that we know of have
examined the effects of chemotherapy regimen on
patient response to exercise. Taxane-based chemotherapies have more toxicities than nontaxanes,
including higher rates of anemia, asthenia, myalgia,
arthralgia, neurosensory effects, and neuromotor
effects that could limit muscular strength and blunt
the training effect.25,26 Taxanes also may have direct
muscle effects. Paclitaxel distributes to skeletal muscle
in rodents,31,32 inhibits the interaction of tubulin with
myosin filaments,33 and reversibly inhibits myocyte
development in animal models.34 Taxane-based chemotherapies also generally require substantially higher
doses of corticosteroid therapy, which are known to
promote muscle catabolism. Once again, differences
in exercise adherence do not appear to explain the
effect. It is possible, however, that side effects from
taxane-based chemotherapies may impede a patient’s
ability to progress with the exercise prescription or
respond to resistance exercise training.
Finally, disease stage moderated the effects of
exercise training on body composition. In the overall
trial analyses,6 RET increased lean body mass by
1.0 kg compared with UC, and AET prevented a 0.9%
fat gain compared with UC. In our moderator analysis, breast cancer patients with stage IIB/IIIA disease
obtained a more robust increase in muscle mass
with RET (3.3 kg) and a greater fat loss with AET and
RET (2%–2.5%). To our knowledge, no previous exercise RCT in cancer patients has examined the moderating effects of disease stage on body composition
endpoints. It is unclear why breast cancer patients
with stage IIB/IIIA disease would obtain better
improvements in body composition; however, adherence partially may explain these findings, because
participants with stage IIB/IIIA disease had a slightly
higher adherence of 8% to 10%.
The overall strengths of our trial have been noted
elsewhere.6 Additional strengths of the current report
include our prespecified moderator analyses, our
selection of prerandomization characteristics as
moderators, the clinical utility of our selected moderators, assessment of patient preference before randomization, a large sample size, use of an intentionto-treat population, direct tests of the interactions,
and biologic or psychosocial plausibility for most of
our findings.8 The overall limitations of our trial also
have been noted elsewhere.6 Additional limitations of
the current report include our failure to obtain a
measure of the strength of patient preference or
change in patient preference over time.
In summary, our moderator analyses indicate
that the responses of breast cancer patients receiving
chemotherapy to exercise training may not be uni-

form and that readily available personal, demographic, and medical factors may help understand
these heterogeneous responses. In terms of maximizing benefits, it appears that AET may be most beneficial for patients with no preference, who are
unmarried, aged <50 years, and have more advanced
disease stage; whereas RET may be most beneficial for
patients who prefer it, are unmarried, are receiving
nontaxane-based chemotherapies, and have more
advanced disease stage. Nevertheless, other than our
primary prespecified effect of patient preference on
QoL, we view our findings as hypothesis-generating
rather than hypothesis-testing.13 Future clinical trials
should attempt to replicate these results as the best
defense against chance findings.8 Until then, exercise
and cancer care professionals may consider our
results when recommending exercise to breast cancer
patients who are receiving chemotherapy.
