Abstract
During the cooking of meat, mutagenic and carcinogenic
heterocyclic amines are formed, the most abundant of which,
2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4-5-b ]pyridine (PhIP),
induces tumors of the prostate, colon, and mammary gland
in rats. Humans consuming cooked meat are exposed to PhIP
on a daily basis, yet few studies have assessed the effects of
PhIP at dietary relevant concentrations. In addition to its
genotoxic properties, recent studies have shown that PhIP can
activate estrogen receptor–mediated signaling pathways at
doses that are similar to those that may be present in the body
following consumption of a cooked meat meal. In the present
study, we examined whether such doses of PhIP can affect
estrogen receptor–independent signal transduction via the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal–related kinase (ERK) pathway to influence proliferation
and migration in the human mammary epithelial cell line
MCF10A and the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. At doses
shown to have a proliferative effect on MCF10A cells (10 11–
10 7 mol/L), PhIP induced a rapid, transient increase in phosphorylation of both MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 and ERKs.
Inhibition of this pathway significantly reduced the PhIPinduced proliferation of MCF10A cells and the migration of
PC-3 cells. The data presented here show that levels of PhIP
that approximate to human dietary exposure stimulate cellular signaling pathways and result in increased growth and
migration, processes linked to the promotion and progression of neoplastic disease. These findings provide strong
evidence that PhIP acts as a tumor initiator and promoter
and that dietary exposure to this compound could contribute
to carcinogenesis in humans. [Cancer Res 2007;67(23):11455–62]

Introduction
Of the environmental factors linked with human carcinogenesis,
diet is regarded as a major determinant, in particular the
consumption of meat (1). During the cooking of meat and fish, a
number of mutagenic compounds known as heterocyclic amines
are formed, and these have been shown to be carcinogenic in
rodent bioassays (2, 3). The most abundant of these compounds is
2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), which
has been shown to induce tumors of the breast, prostate and
colon in animal models (4, 5). The finding that PhIP induces cancer
in three tissue sites where tumors occur with high incidence in the

Western world and the presence of PhIP in a Western-style diet rich
in cooked meat suggest that this compound may pose a significant
threat to human health. In support of this, PhIP-DNA adducts have
been detected in human breast, colon, and prostate tissue (6–9),
whereas a number of epidemiology studies have reported associations between consumption of red meat, PhIP intake, and
cancer of the breast, prostate, and colon (10–13). It is generally
acknowledged that the carcinogenic potential of PhIP is initiated
with the formation of PhIP-DNA adducts resulting in mutation.
The mechanistic basis of this involves primarily CYP1A2-mediated
oxidation to the N-hydroxy derivative (14), then esterification
resulting in an unstable product that generates a nitrenium ion
that attacks and adducts to guanine in DNA (15).
In addition to its genotoxic properties, there is a growing body of
evidence suggesting that PhIP also has effects on mammary gland
development, proliferation, and signal transduction that could contribute to carcinogenesis. In rat models, PhIP exposure is associated
with increased cell proliferation in terminal end buds of the mammary gland and inhibition of the differentiation of these terminal
end buds into alveolar buds, which are structures that are less
susceptible to carcinogenesis (16). PhIP retards the involution of the
mammary gland in lactating rats on weaning through the inhibition
of apoptosis of the secretory mammary epithelial cells (17). In addition, micromolar concentrations of PhIP have been shown to have a
direct inhibitory effect on apoptosis in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A (18), and this was associated with activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular
signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, which plays a critical role in
the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.
Recent work in our laboratory has shown that at nanomolar concentrations, which is thought to be close to circulating plasma levels
following a cooked meat meal, PhIP stimulates estrogen receptor
a–induced activation of estrogenic genes and induces a proliferative response in estrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cells (19).
In these studies, PhIP was also found to activate ERK1 and ERK2,
and this was only partially inhibited by the antiestrogen ICI 182,780,
thus suggesting that PhIP may also be able to affect cell signaling
pathways by estrogen receptor–independent mechanisms.
Estrogens play a crucial role in regulating the growth, differentiation, and function of many reproductive tissues, and the principal
physiologic estrogen 17h-estradiol is considered to be a major risk
factor in the development of breast cancer and has also been
implicated in the etiology of colorectal and prostate cancer (20–22).
A major role of the MAPK ERK pathway is to modulate gene
transcription involved in cell proliferation and migration, and ERK
activation has been reported in human mammary and prostate
cancer tissues (23, 24). Given that consumption of cooked meat can
lead to low levels of PhIP being present in body fluids such as breast
milk (25), it is possible that PhIP may exert estrogenic and mitogenic
effects in humans that could contribute to carcinogenesis.

Cancer Research

To investigate whether low doses of PhIP (nanomolar concentrations) can directly affect MAPK signaling, we have used MCF10A
cells, which are estrogen receptor negative, and a human prostate
cancer cell line, PC-3.

Materials and Methods

Immunoblotting

Materials
MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection. Human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3
cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Ham’s
F-12/DMEM (1:1) growth medium, horse serum, L-glutamine, penicillin/
streptomycin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, and trypsin-EDTA
were purchased from Invitrogen Corporation. Cholera toxin was purchased
from Merck Biosciences Ltd. PhIP (MW, 224) was purchased from Toronto
Research Chemicals, Inc. CellTiter-Blue cell viability assay was from
Promega. Inhibitors of EGF receptor (EGFR; Tyrphostin AG1478) and

solution and QCM Chemotaxis 96-well cell migration assay were from
Chemicon International. p44/42 MAPK assay kit was purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased

Cell Proliferation Assay
MCF10A cells. MCF10A cells were routinely cultured in 1:1 Ham’s
F-12/DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
100 IU/mL penicillin/100 Ag/mL streptomycin, 20 ng/mL EGF, 100 ng/mL
cholera toxin, 0.01 mg/mL insulin, and 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone. Cells
were cultured in an incubator maintained at 5% CO2 and 37jC. A serumfree medium was prepared containing all supplements except horse serum
(IHE medium). For experiments, MCF10A cells were seeded into six-well
plates (2.5  104 per well) and allowed to adhere overnight. The following
day, medium was removed and cells were washed with PBS and then treated
with PhIP in IHE medium in the presence or absence of the MEK1/2
inhibitor PD98059 (50 Amol/L). Cells were cultured under treatment for
6 days and the medium was replaced every 2 days. Dilutions of PhIP were
made up in absolute ethanol whereas inhibitors were made up in DMSO,
and all compounds were administered at a final concentration of 0.1%
vehicle in the media.
Following treatment, viability was measured using the CellTiter-Blue cell
viability assay. Six hundred microliters of CellTiter-Blue reagent were added
to each well (containing 3 mL of medium), and the cells were then
incubated at 37jC for a further 2 h. The assay is based on the reduction
of resazurin (7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one-10-oxide) to resorufin, and
preliminary experiments showed a direct correlation between fluorescence
and MCF10A cell number (data not shown). Following incubation, resorufin
fluorescence was measured with a fluorimeter (BMG PolarStar) at 560-nm
excitation and 590-nm emission. All experiments were done in triplicate
wells and repeated on three separate occasions. The percent proliferative
potency was calculated as described previously (19).
PC-3 cells. PC-3 cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 IU/mL penicillin/
100 Ag/mL streptomycin in an incubator maintained at 5% CO2, 37jC.
For proliferation experiments, cells were seeded into flat-bottomed
96-well plates at a density of 2,500 per well and allowed to adhere overnight.
The following day, medium was removed from the wells and cells were
rinsed briefly with sterile PBS before addition of serum-free medium (RPMI

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

1640 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin). After incubation in
serum-free medium for 24 h, the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640
supplemented with 0.5% FBS and antibiotics, and cells were treated with
varying concentrations of PhIP or ethanol solvent control in low-serum
(0.5%) medium. Cells were treated for 6 days in total, with chemicals and
media replaced every 2 days.
MCF10A or PC-3 cells were seeded in T150 flasks and grown to 75%
confluency. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and placed in serumfree medium devoid of all supplements and antibiotics for 24 h. Various
concentrations of PhIP or ethanol solvent control were then added to the
cells. After treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then
lysed on ice for 5 min in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 8.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, and 5 mmol/L EDTA, supplemented
with 10 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
50 Ag/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 Ag/mL aprotinin, and 10 Ag/mL
leupeptin. Cells were then scraped from the flasks and centrifuged at
14,000  g at 4jC for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and protein
content was determined with a Pierce BCA protein assay kit.
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane. Following incubation with primary and secondary
antibodies, proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence
detection system.

MAPK Assay
To investigate the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by PhIP, a kinase assay
was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Cell Signaling
Technology). The assay is based on the immunoprecipitation of active
MAPK (ERK1/ERK2) from cell lysates, followed by incubation of the
immunoprecipitate with an ELK-1 fusion protein in the presence of ATP
and kinase buffer; under these conditions, immunoprecipitated active
ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylates ELK-1.
MCF10A cells were seeded into flasks and allowed to adhere overnight.
The following day, cells were washed and placed in serum-free medium
devoid of all supplements and were treated 24 h later with PhIP in the
presence or absence of inhibitors. All inhibitors were added to cells 30 min
before PhIP treatment.
Following treatment, cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and kinase assay
were done according to the manufacturer’s instructions and phosphorylated
ELK-1 was visualized by immunoblotting.

Cell Migration/Chemotaxis Assay
A cell migration assay was carried out with PC-3 or MCF10A cells using a
chemotaxis assay (Chemicon International). Briefly, PC-3 or MCF10A cells
were incubated in their respective serum-free medium for 24 h, following
which they were detached from flasks, suspended in quenching medium
(serum-free medium containing 5% bovine serum albumin) and PhIP or
ethanol, and seeded into Boyden migration chamber inserts placed in a
96-well plate. The inserts contain a microporous membrane with an 8-Am
pore size. Inserts were placed over wells containing serum-free media plus
chemoattractant (10% FBS). After a 24-h treatment period, cells/media were
discarded from the top side of the migration chamber insert and the
chamber was placed in the wells of a new 96-well plate containing cell
detachment solution. Following incubation for 30 min at 37 C, the insert
was then discarded, and a solution of lysis buffer and CyQuant GR dye was
added to each well. CyQuant is a green fluorescent dye that exhibits strong
enhancement of fluorescence when bound to cellular nucleic acids released
by the lysis buffer, enabling assessment of the relative number of migrated
cells. Fluorescence was determined with a fluorimeter at 480/520 nm.

Results
Cell Proliferation
The ability of PhIP to influence proliferation in the estrogen
receptor–negative breast epithelial cell line MCF10A was examined
by a fluorometric assay as described in Materials and Methods.

PhIP Activates the ERK MAPK Pathway

Under serum-free conditions, MCF10A is dependent on addition of
exogenous EGF and insulin for proliferation. Insulin acts through
IGF-IR. After 6 days of treatment in medium devoid of serum but
containing EGF, insulin, and other supplements (IHE medium), low
doses of PhIP (10 9–10 7 mol/L) caused a weak increase in cell
proliferation in MCF10A cells (Fig. 1). Concurrent treatment with
the MAPK pathway inhibitor PD98059 significantly abolished the
increase in cell proliferation induced by PhIP, as did the RAF-1
kinase inhibitor I (Fig. 1).
Low concentrations of PhIP (10 12–10 8 mol/L) also stimulated
the proliferation of PC-3 cells grown under low-serum conditions
(Fig. 1). The effect of PhIP on proliferation seemed to be more
potent in the prostate cell line than in MCF10A cells, reaching an
f80% increase in proliferation versus controls in PC-3 compared
with a maximal increase in proliferation of f20% in MCF10A.

Cell Migration/Chemotaxis
Addition of PhIP to PC-3 cells in the upper compartment of the
Boyden migration chamber significantly increased the ability of the

Cells were placed in the upper compartment of the migration chamber in
serum-free medium containing PhIP or ethanol for 24 h. Cells that had migrated
to the underside of the chamber were detached from the membrane, lysed, and
quantitated by fluorescent staining with CyQuant dye. In some experiments,
the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 was added (50 mmol/L). Columns, mean of three
separate experiments each done in five replicate wells; bars, SE. **, P < 0.01,

cells to migrate through the pores to the chemotactic (FBS)
stimulus compared with the vehicle-treated control cell population
(Fig. 2). This effect was seen at similar levels with all concentrations
of PhIP examined (10 12–10 7 mol/L), with the migratory ability of
cells exposed to PhIP increasing from f2-fold over cells treated
with ethanol alone. In MCF10A cells, 10 10 mol/L PhIP seemed to
slightly elevate migration; however, the effect was not significant
and decreased with increasing PhIP concentration (Fig. 2).
PD98059 was added to PC-3 cells to examine the involvement
of the MAPK pathway in PhIP-induced chemotaxis. As shown
in Fig. 2, PD98059 (50 Amol/L) significantly inhibited the number
of cells migrating through the chamber in response to PhIP treatment, implying the involvement of the MAPK pathway in mediating PhIP-induced PC-3 cell migration.

MAPK Pathway
Phosphorylation of MAPK pathway proteins. Having observed an increase in cell proliferation and migration that was
ablated by the MAPK ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059, the effect
of PhIP on this pathway was further examined. This signaling

pathway plays a major role in the regulation of cell proliferation
and differentiation (26) and involves a protein kinase cascade
following growth factor stimulation, which leads to the successive
phosphorylation, and thus activation, of RAF-1, MEK1/2, and then
ERK1 and ERK2, which then target a number of transcription
factors involved in regulating mitogenesis, such as ELK-1. PD98059
acts by inhibiting MEK1/2.
In MCF10A, PhIP rapidly induced a small but significant increase
in the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 in the first hour following
treatment at doses (10 7–10 9 mol/L) associated with increased
proliferation (Fig. 3). Total levels of MEK1/2 were unchanged
during this period and effectively served as a loading standard.
A similar effect was observed for the phosphorylation of ERK1/2
(Fig. 4), confirming that PhIP was indeed activating MEK1/2 to
induce phosphorylation of the ERK protein. This increased
phosphorylation of both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 protein persisted
for at least 60 min (Figs. 3 and 4), but was no longer apparent
4 h after initial exposure (data not shown). Similar effects were
noted in PC-3 cells (Figs. 3 and 4) with lower concentrations of

PhIP (10 9–10 11 mol/L PhIP). In PC-3 cells, PhIP-mediated phosphorylation of MEK1/2 was shorter lived, being attenuated after
10 min. However, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 remained elevated at
60 min, particularly at the lower dose (10 11 mol/L PhIP). Thus,
PC-3 cells seemed to be more sensitive to PhIP-mediated MAPK
activation than were the MCF10A cells. This is consistent with the
proliferation and migration characteristics of the two cell lines.
MAPK assay. To further confirm the finding that PhIP
stimulates the MAPK pathway, a kinase assay was carried out
with MCF10A cells. The assay involved evaluation of the amount of
phosphate incorporated into an ELK-1 fusion protein that serves as
a substrate for immunoprecipitated active ERK1/2. This assay
confirmed that ERK1 and ERK2 are activated within 30 min of PhIP
treatment. This activation was observed at concentrations as low
as 10 12 mol/L PhIP (Fig. 5).
MCF10A cells were also treated in the presence of inhibitors of
the MAPK pathway to gain an insight into the mechanism by which
PhIP activates ERK1/2. As expected, the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059
dramatically reduced the kinase activity of ERK1/2 induced by PhIP

(Fig. 5). This is consistent with the effect of PD98059 on MCF10A
proliferation (Fig. 1). AG1478, a highly specific inhibitor of the
EGFR tyrosine kinase, also produced a marked suppression of
kinase activity (Fig. 5), as did I-OMe-AG538, an inhibitor of IGF-IR
kinase (Fig. 5). The effect of this latter inhibitor was less marked
than that of PD98059 or AG1478.
Finally, to support our finding that the MEK1/2 inhibitor
PD98059 dramatically reduced the migration of PC-3 cells in
response to PhIP treatment (Fig. 2), we examined the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the presence of PD98059. The result shown
in Fig. 6 confirmed that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by
PhIP was significantly attenuated.

Discussion
Few studies have assessed the effects of PhIP at concentrations
that are likely to be present in humans following consumption of

www.aacrjournals.org

a cooked meat meal. Human consumption of heterocyclic amines
has been estimated as ranging from as low as 1 Ag to more than
50 Ag per day (27). Given the rapid and extensive bioavailability of
PhIP, circulating plasma levels are likely to be in the nanomolar
range following consumption of cooked meat (28). At such
concentrations, the genotoxicity of PhIP is not detectable but its
ability to activate signaling pathways is (19). The data presented
here show that extraordinarily low doses of PhIP are able to
increase proliferation and stimulate the MAPK signaling pathway
in an estrogen receptor–negative human mammary epithelial cell
line, MCF10A, and the prostate cancer cell line PC-3.
Previous studies have shown that high doses of PhIP (10 4 mol/L)
could inhibit apoptosis in MCF10A cells under conditions of serum
and growth factor deprivation, an in vitro model for apoptosis of
the involuting mammary gland (18). The experimental conditions
for the proliferation studies described here involved the withdrawal
of serum but not exogenous growth factors. These growth factors

Figure 5. Effect of PhIP on the kinase activity of ERK1 and ERK2 in MCF10A
cells. ERK1/2 kinase activity was determined by the detection of ELK-1
phosphorylation by active ERK1 and ERK2 immunoprecipitated from MCF10A
cells treated with PhIP for 30 min in serum-free medium (A), in the presence
of the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (50 Amol/L; B ), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
AG1478 (AG ; 30 nmol/L; C ), or IGF-IR kinase inhibitor I-OMe-AG538
(30 Amol/L; D ) for 30 min in serum-free medium. Bands represent separate
kinase assays carried out with different cell lysates.

(EGF and IGF-I) continue to exert prosurvival effects (29), and as
such, the increased cell viability observed in these studies following
the addition of PhIP is not believed to be an effect of apoptosis
inhibition but is due to an increase in mitogenic stimulation. In
concordance with this, PhIP treatment also resulted in increased
proliferation in PC-3 cells in low-serum medium. Indeed, the effects
of PhIP seemed to be more profound in PC-3 cells. It is possible that
the effect was less marked in the MCF10A cell model because the
additional stimulation provided by PhIP was only marginal in the
presence of the added exogenous cell survival factors.
The development of migratory and invasive properties is a key
event in the oncogenic progression of cells (30), and cell motility is
one of the rate-limiting steps of invasion. Chemotactic motility,
which involves the sensing of a concentration gradient of chemoattractants such as cytokines or growth factors, reorganization of
the actin cytoskeleton, and subsequent movement toward the
chemoattractant, is therefore believed to play a major role in tumor
invasion and metastasis (31).
Using a cell migration assay, it was shown that PhIP was able to
significantly increase the number of migratory PC-3 cells. This
stimulatory effect of PhIP was even more potent than its mitogenic
effects, with cell movement more than doubling at doses as low as

10 11 mol/L. In MCF10A cells, however, PhIP had no significant
effect on cell migration, although a very slight increase was
observed with the two lowest doses used. Unlike PC-3 cells, which
are derived from a prostate carcinoma bone metastasis and already
display invasive properties, MCF10A cells are not transformed and
have the phenotypic characteristics of normal breast cells (32).
Whereas the fully transformed, malignant breast epithelial cell line
MCF-7 seems to be constantly motile on laminin-5–coated
surfaces, the majority of MCF10A cells maintain a stationary
phenotype in such a model (33). Our findings suggest that PhIP is
better able to promote motility in cells that are predisposed to an
invasive phenotype.
The ERK signal transduction cascade plays a central role in cell
proliferation and motility (34, 35). These proliferative and
migratory effects influence tumor promotion and progression,
and ERK signaling is stimulated by a number of tumor promoters
including 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (36). Elevated ERK
has been reported in human breast tumors (23, 37) whereas
changes in several key regulatory pathways that can lead to ERK
activation, such as ErbB, protein kinase C, and insulin-like growth
factor receptor, are frequently elevated in breast tumors and are
associated with resistance to hormonal therapy (38–41). Levels of
activated ERK have also been shown to be significantly increased in
human prostate tumors compared with benign samples, and activation has been correlated with increasing Gleason score (24, 42).
Given the importance of ERK1 and ERK2 signaling in cell
proliferation, motility, and carcinogenesis, we examined whether
this pathway might be associated with the mitogenic and
migratory effects of PhIP. Pretreatment of MCF10A cells with the
highly specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 led to a dramatic reduction
in the proliferation of MCF10A cells. This is to be expected because
both EGF and IGF-I activate the ERK pathway to stimulate
proliferation (43, 44). The increased proliferation over control cells
induced by PhIP was also completely abolished by PD98059,
suggesting that PhIP is stimulating proliferation in these cells by an
ERK-mediated mechanism. Activation of the ERK MAPK pathway
also seemed to be critical for the effect of PhIP on PC-3 cell
migration because addition of the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059
almost entirely ablated the increase in motility stimulated by PhIP.
This correlates with a previous work showing the critical role
played by this pathway in PC-3 cell migration and anchorageindependent growth (45).
The effect of PhIP on the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2
was examined in both MCF10A and PC-3 cells. At doses shown to
have a proliferative effect on MCF10A cells (10 11–10 7 mol/L),
PhIP induced a rapid, transient increase in phosphorylation of both
MEK1/2 and ERKs. This increase was observed at time points up to
an hour after PhIP exposure, and levels of phosphorylation had
returned to basal 4 h after treatment, a pattern of activation similar

of the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (50 Amol/L).
Phosphorylated and total forms of ERK1/2 were evaluated
by immunoblotting with protein extracts obtained from
PC-3 cells treated with PhIP and PD98059 in serum-free
medium.

PhIP Activates the ERK MAPK Pathway

to that observed following mitogenic stimulation through the addition of growth factors such as EGF (46).
Kinase assays were also carried out in MCF10A cells to confirm
that PhIP-induced phosphorylation of ERKs led to activation of
ERK1/2 by measuring the ability of immunoprecipitated activated
ERKs to phosphorylate the downstream transcription factor ELK-1.
PhIP (10 7 mol/L) was shown to increase the level of ELK-1
phosphorylation, and as expected, this was reduced by the MEK
inhibitor PD98059. Notably, PhIP was able to increase ERK activity
at concentrations as low as 10 10 and 10 12 mol/L.
The mechanism by which PhIP stimulates the ERK pathway is as
yet unclear. PhIP has previously been found to have estrogenic
properties (19); however, the cell lines used in the present
experiment are estrogen receptor negative. A number of xenoestrogens have been shown to be able to modify estrogen receptor–
independent signaling pathways. For example, p-nonylphenol can
increase ERK1 and ERK2 activation in bovine adrenal medulla cells
in an estrogen receptor–independent manner (47) whereas the
phytoestrogens genistein and quercetin have been shown to
activate ERK1 and ERK2 via transactivation of EGFR in a process
mediated by the G protein–coupled receptor homologue GPR30
(48). Inhibitors of both EGFR and IGF-IR were therefore used in an
attempt to shed light on how PhIP is able to activate the MAPK
pathway. Interestingly, the highly specific inhibitor of EGFR kinase,
AG1478, produced a marked inhibition of the kinase activity of
ERKs induced by PhIP, as measured by kinase assay, whereas
I-OMe-AG538, an inhibitor of IGF-IR kinase, also reduced PhIPinduced MAPK activity, although not by as great an extent. These
results raise the possibility that PhIP activates the ERK pathway by
modulating the activation of growth factor receptors, specifically
EGFR and IGF-IR.
The genotoxicity of PhIP has generally been assumed to be the
major mode of action by which it induces cancer; however, this
study and others suggest that alternative mechanisms may also be
important. Whereas PhIP-DNA adducts have been found in the
target organs of the compound in chronic feeding studies (5, 49),
they have also been found to be distributed in other nontarget
tissues such as the pancreas and lungs without induction of tumors
(50). It is therefore likely that PhIP possesses additional mechanisms of action that may influence its carcinogenic effects.
Previous work in our group and other laboratories has shown
that at low levels (10 6–10 10 mol/L), PhIP is able to stimulate
proliferation in estrogen receptor–positive human mammary
carcinoma MCF-7 cells in a manner that is inhibited by the
antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (19, 51, 52). More recently, Nakai et al. (53)
reported that whereas PhIP treatment of Big Blue rats resulted in

increased mutation frequencies in all lobes of the prostate, increased proliferation was only observed in the ventral lobe, the area
where PhIP specifically induces prostate cancer. The authors
concluded that in addition to acting as a tumor initiator, PhIP may
also act as an organ- or lobe-specific promoter.
PhIP-DNA adducts have been reported in the human mammary gland, colon, and prostate, supporting the concept that
PhIP has initiating potential in humans (7–9). The results reported
here that low-dose PhIP is able to stimulate mammary and prostate cell proliferation and motility of prostate cancer cells provide further evidence to suggest that PhIP also has the potential to
exert a promotional influence on cells previously initiated by PhIP
or other genotoxic agents. An increase in the rate of cell proliferation will reduce the time available for DNA repair processes
to remove DNA adducts before cell replication converts adducts
to mutations, thereby resulting in a higher probability of induction
of mutations.
One of the requirements of tumor promotion is repeated
exposure to the promoting agent. A small proportion of a dose of
PhIP remains unmetabolized and is excreted in the urine for at
least 12 h following consumption of a cooked meat meal (28). This
suggests that cells are exposed to low levels of PhIP for prolonged
periods, and regular intake of cooked meat would be expected to
provide repeated, prolonged exposure to both PhIP and PhIP
metabolites. Meat-consuming humans are likely to be exposed to
low levels of PhIP on a daily basis. Whereas CYP1A2-mediated
metabolic activation of PhIP to genotoxic species has been a major
area of study, other biological activities of PhIP have not been
examined. The genotoxic potency of PhIP is well established, but
is only detectable at comparatively high doses of the chemical
(>10 5 mol/L). We have described an important biological activity of the chemical at remarkably low doses, in some instances
f10 12 mol/L, which are well below the K m (54) of xenobiotic
metabolizing enzymes (f10 5 mol/L). It is concentrations such as
these that are likely to persist in humans consuming cooked meat.
It is therefore possible that dietary PhIP could act both as a tumor
initiator and as a promoter and that exposure to this compound
may contribute to carcinogenesis in humans.
