Abstract
Aim: Despite the impressive efficacy of crizotinib for the treatment of
ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer, patients invariably develop therapeutic
resistance. Suppression of the IGF-1R signaling pathway may abrogate this acquired
mechanism of drug resistance to crizotinib. Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic
agent, may reverse crizotinib resistance through inhibition of IGF-1R signaling.
Results: The present study revealed that metformin effectively increased the
sensitivity of both crizotinib-sensitive and -resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells
to crizotinib, as evidenced by decreased proliferation and invasion and enhanced
apoptosis. Metformin reduced IGF-1R signaling activation in crizotinib-resistant cells.
Furthermore, the addition of IGF-1 to crizotinib-sensitive H2228 cells induced crizotinib
resistance, which was overcome by metformin.
Experimental design: The effects of metformin to reverse crizotinib resistance
were examined in vitro by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
(MTT), invasion assay, ki67 incorporation assay, flow cytometry analysis, Western blot
analysis, and colony-forming assay.
Conclusions: Metformin may be used in combination with crizotinib in ALK+ NSCLC
patients to overcome crizotinib resistance and prolong survival.

Introduction

Crizotinib is a multitargeted TKI with activity
against MET, ALK, and ROS1 [4, 5]. This active
substance has been found to greatly outperform the best
chemotherapy agents in NSCLC patients with ALK
rearrangements [6, 7]. Recently, the PROFILE 1014 study
demonstrated that crizotinib significantly improved PFS
and ORR in the first-line treatment for ALK-positive
NSCLC patients, with an acceptable safety profile, thus
establishing crizotinib as a standard of care for previously
untreated ALK-positive patients [8]. However, acquired
resistance eventually develops in most patients. Two main
mechanisms of crizotinib resistance have been reported.
One of them is the alteration in the gene itself, including
second-site ALK mutations and ALK copy number gain.
The other mechanism is activation of alternative signaling
pathways, including the development of EGFR mutations
or activation of the wild-type EGFR, HER2-, or KIT-

Genomic alterations in the anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) gene are found in numerous malignancies
[1]. ALK rearrangements, first discovered by Soda
et al. in 2007 [2], are either inversions or translocations
of the ALK-tyrosine kinase (-TK) receptor gene with
other fusion partners. The expression of the echinoderm
microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion
oncogene, which is caused by a small inversion within
chromosome 2p, was found in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) [2]. The product of the ALK rearrangement
consists of a constitutively activated receptor TK with
pro-oncogenic effects [3]. Consequently, tumors with ALK
rearrangements are associated with ALK signaling, thus
being effectively inhibited by small molecules ALK-TK
inhibitors (-TKIs).

We revealed that the combination of metformin and
crizotinib caused substantial inhibition of the cell
proliferation of H2228 and H3122 cells (Figure 1C and
Supplementary Figure 1).
Then, we performed a transwell assay to determine
whether the drug combination exerted a more pronounced
inhibitory effect on tumor cell invasion. It was found
that metformin or crizotinib alone decreased the
invasion ability of H2228 and H3122 cells, whereas the
combination of metformin and crizotinib further enhanced
this effect (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 1).
We next analyzed the induction of apoptosis
in H2228 cells treated with metformin alone or in
combination with crizotinib. The flow cytometry analysis
results revealed that metformin in combination with
crizotinib significantly enhanced the apoptosis of H2228
cells (Figure 1E). The same finding was observed in
H3122 cells treated with metformin, or crizotinib, or both
(Supplementary Figure 1). Of note, metformin of 5 mM
only slightly decreased cell viability in cells used in the
current study (Supplementary Figure 2). These in vitro
data suggest that when applied in combination, metformin
increases crizotinib sensitivity in crizotinib-sensitive cells.

receptors [9–12]. Thus, innovative treatment strategies
are urgently needed to overcome therapeutic resistance to
crizotinib to improve the survival of NSCLC patients.
Molecular mechanisms underlying acquired
crizotinib resistance are still not fully elucidated, mainly
due to the small number of experimental results and
included patients. Gatekeeper mutations, such as L1196M,
L1152R, C1156Y, and F1174L hinder drug binding and are
frequently detected in crizotinib-resistant samples [13, 14].
Besides, the IGF-1R signaling pathway is involved in
crizotinib resistance. In a previous study, the addition
of IGF-1 induced resistance to the inhibitory effects
of crizotinib on growth. Chronic ALK inhibition was
associated with enhanced IGF-1R signaling. Furthermore,
the addition of an IGF-1R inhibitor sensitized the cells
resistant to the effects of ALK blockade [15]. Thus, the
IGF-1R signaling axis is a potential therapeutic target in
ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer.
Metformin is an insulin-sensitizing agent that
has been used over 40 years to treat type II diabetes.
Metformin has aroused keen interest as a potential
anticancer agent ever since the report was published of
the clinical evidence that the cancer risk and mortality
were reduced in diabetics who received metformin [16].
Previously, we reported that metformin in combination
with gefitinib or erlotinib had a synergistic inhibitory
effect on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of
cell lines resistant to EGFR-TKIs (epidermal growth
factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors) [17]. However,
it remains unknown whether metformin may overcome
crizotinib resistance. Interestingly, metformin has been
found to exert an inhibitory effect on IGF-1R signaling
[18, 19], which encouraged us to perform the present study
aimed at investigating whether metformin could restore
crizotinib sensitivity in crizotinib-resistant cells through
inhibition of the IGF-1R signaling pathway.

Metformin reversed crizotinib resistance in
crizotinib-resistant cells
We next speculated whether metformin could
overcome crizotinib resistance in crizotinib-resistant
human lung cancer cells. For this purpose, we established
two crizotinib-resistant sublines (H2228-CR and
H3122-CR cells), which were derived from the parental
H2228 and H3122 cell lines by long-term exposure
to high concentrations of crizotinib for eight months.
Typical epithelial morphology features were observed in
H2228 and H3122 cells, whereas spindle-cell shapes were
observed in H2228-CR and H3122-CR cells (Figure 2A).
Further, the MTT results indicated that H2228-CR cells
and H3122-CR cells exhibited higher resistance to
crizotinib than the parental cell lines, while the addition of
metformin significantly increased the sensitivity of both
resistant cell lines to crizotinib (Figure 2B and 2C).
By transwell assay, we investigated whether
metformin could decrease tumor invasion in crizotinib
resistant H2228-CR and H3122-CRcells. The results
showed that metformin or crizotinib alone decreased
slightly the cell invasion, whereas the drug combination
significantly enhanced this inhibitory effect (Figure 2D
and Supplementary Figure 3). Next, by using flow
cytometry analysis, we found that metformin utilized
together with crizotinib had a synergistic effect of
enhancing the apoptosis of H2228-CR cells and H3122-CR
cells (Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure 3). Taken
together, these data suggest that metformin resensitized the
cells resistant to crizotinib by inhibiting their proliferation
and invasion and promoting apoptosis.

Results
Metformin increased crizotinib sensitivity in
crizotinib-sensitive human non-small cell lung
cancer cells
We first performed MTT assays to establish
whether metformin could enhance the inhibitory action
of crizotinib on the growth of crizotinib-sensitive H2228
and H3122 cells. H2228 and H3122 cells were sensitive
to crizotinib, with IC50 values of 0.76 ± 0.02 μM and
0.36 ± 0.04 μM, respectively. The treatment with 5 mM
metformin further increased the sensitivity of those cells
to crizotinib (Figure 1A and 1B).
We next performed a Ki67 incorporation assay
to confirm the effect of metformin in combination with
crizotinib since metformin disrupts mitochondrial
respiration, which may affect the MTT assay results.

Metformin decreased IGF1-R signaling in both
crizotinib-sensitive and -resistant cell lines

decreased IGF-1R phosphorylation, whereas the separate
use of crizotinib enhanced IGF-1R phosphorylation.
Concerning the effect exerted on the downstream signaling
molecules, we discovered that metformin alone or in
combination with crizotinib reduced the phosphorylation
levels of mTOR, p70s6k, and S6, whereas it did not alter
the activation of AKT (Figure 3).
Further, we investigated the possible mechanism by
which metformin reduced IGF-1R signaling activation.
It was reported that metformin disrupted mitochondrial

To identify the molecular mechanisms of metformin
in overcoming acquired crizotinib resistance, we examined
the effect of metformin on IGF1-R signaling activation,
which was reported to be the key mechanism for crizotinib
resistance [15]. Starting with drug sensitive H2228
cells, we performed a Western Blot analysis and found
that metformin alone or in combination with crizotinib

respiration, which then increased the intracellular ratio of
AMP: ATP and induced activation of AMPK [20]. We thus
analyzed the activation of AMPK caused by the metformin
treatment. The results showed that metformin alone or in
combination significantly stimulated the activation of
AMPK (Figure 3). Taken together, these data suggest
that metformin decreases IGF-1R signaling activation in
H2228 cells.
We next attempted to elucidate whether IGF-1R
signaling manifested enhanced activation in H2228-CR

cells, and whether metformin could attenuate it. The
results from the Western Blot analysis showed that
IGF-1R phosphorylation was elevated in the ALK-TKIresistant cells, together with upregulated expression of
phosphorylated proteins, including AKT, mTOR, p70s6k,
and S6. Similarly to its effect in H2228 cells, metformin
alone or in combination with crizotinib decreased the
expression of phosphorylated IGF-1R, mTOR, p70s6k,
and S6. Also, decreased activation of AMPK was noted
in H2228-CR cells when compared to that of the parental

of its downstream molecules, including IGF-1R, AKT,
mTOR, p70s6k, and S6 and led to the decreased activation
of AMPK. Metformin reduced the phosphorylation of
IGF-1R, mTOR, p70s6k, and S6, and stimulated the
activation of AMPK (Figure 5D). In summary, our data
indicate that the IGF-1 activation of IGF-1R/mTOR/S6
pathway was sufficient to induce increased crizotinib
resistance, whereas metformin successfully restored
crizotinib sensitivity and decreased IGF-1R/mTOR/S6
signaling activation.

cells, whereas metformin promoted the phosphorylation of
AMPK in the resistant cells (Figure 4). Overall, these data
showed that metformin suppressed the IGF-1R/mTOR/
S6 signaling pathway in both crizotinib-sensitive and
-resistant H2228-CR cells.

Metformin reversed IGF-1-induced crizotinib
resistance
Given that IGF-1 addition induced resistance to
crizotinib [15], we next investigated whether metformin
could overcome IGF-1-induced crizotinib resistance
in H2228 cells. As illustrated in Figure 5A and 5B,
48-h culture in IGF-1-containing medium decreased
the sensitivity of H2228 cells to crizotinib, whereas the
metformin addition restored the sensitivity. We also
performed Ki67 incorporation assay, and the results
revealed that the addition of IGF-1 slightly enhanced
cell proliferation (not significantly different), while
the addition of metformin caused a decline in the
incorporation of Ki67 (Figure 5C).
Next, we examined IGF-1R activation in H2228
cells treated with IGF-1 or IGF-1 plus metformin. The
IGF-1 exposure resulted in significant phosphorylation

Discussion
In the present study, we report for the first time
that metformin in combination with crizotinib not only
enhances crizotinib sensitivity in crizotinib-sensitive
cell lines, but reverses crizotinib resistance in crizotinibresistant cell lines. The effect of metformin against
crizotinib resistance was attributed to its ability to
decrease IGF-1R signaling activation. We thus provide
the rationale and experimental evidence for the combined
use of metformin and crizotinib to overcome crizotinib
resistance in ALK+ NSCLC patients.

Clinical significance: Metformin overcomes
crizotinib resistance

Metformin is an oral antidiabetic drug and is of
emerging interest due to its anti-cancer capacity. In recent
years, a number of retrospective epidemiological and
pre-clinical studies have supported the use of metformin
as an adjuvant in the chemotherapy for cancer treatment
[21]. In lung cancer patients with diabetes, meta-analysis
showed that the use of metformin improved survival
[22]. A retrospective study from our group showed
that in advanced NSCLC patients with type 2 diabetes,
metformin together with EGFR-TKI resulted in longer
PFS and OS [23]. Metformin can target cancer stem
cells, which are hypothesized to be critical initiators of
cancers [24]. In HER2-positive carcinomas, metformin
in combination with the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody
trastuzumab could synergistically suppress the selfrenewal and proliferation of cancer stem/progenitor
cells [25]. Metformin is also involved in the targeted
therapy of NSCLCs. Previously, we and other researchers

Patients with ALK gene rearrangements often
manifest dramatic responses to crizotinib, while acquired
drug resistance develops eventually and inevitably. One
interesting approach to reversing crizotinib resistance
would be that of adding another drug to crizotinib. A
combination of crizotinib with pemetrexed, or a targeted
agent, such as an Hsp90 inhibitor, is currently being tested
in clinical trials in ALK-positive advanced NSCLCs [7]. In
the present study, we also adopted this approach, by using
metformin in combination with crizotinib. As expected,
the addition of metformin enhanced the sensitivity of
H2228 and H3122 cells to crizotinib. Moreover, in the
crizotinib-resistant H2228-CR and H3122-CR cells, the
combination of metformin reversed drug resistance, as
shown by both MTT and Ki67 incorporation assays.

Figure 4: Metformin decreased IGF-1R signaling in crizotinib-resistant human lung cancer cells. The expression of the
indicated markers on protein extracts obtained from H2228 cells and H2228-CR cells with different treatments was analyzed via Western
blotting, and β-actin was used as a loading control. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.

(H2228-CR and H3122-CR cells) in this study were
derived from the parental H2228 and H3122 cell lines by
long-term exposure to high concentrations of crizotinib
for eight months and can be considered as research on
acquired crizotinib resistance. Whether metformin can
reverse the primary crizotinib resistance needs to be
further confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Third, we added
IGF-1 into the culture medium and observed crizotinib
resistance. It would be better to establish cell lines with
overexpression of IGF-1 to further investigate the effect
of IGF-1-induced crizotinib resistance.
Therapeutic resistance to crizotinib is almost
inevitable in patients with ALK rearrangements. Here,
we report for the first time that metformin overcomes
crizotinib resistance in vitro by inhibiting the IGF-1R
signaling pathway. Thus, we propose that when combined
with crizotinib, metformin can have future, potentially
significant clinical utility in the therapy of ALK-positive
NSCLC patients.

reported that metformin in combination with EGFR-TKIs
erlotinib or gefitinib had a synergistic inhibitory effect
on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cell lines
resistant to TKIs [17, 26]. Taken together, data from the
current study suggest that metformin, in combination
with crizotinib, has the promising potential of turning
into a novel anti-cancer agent that enhances the effect of
crizotinib.

IGF-1R signaling: the key for metformin to
overcome crizotinib resistance
Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which
metformin overcomes crizotinib resistance is essential
to its development as a novel agent for the treatment of
NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangement. Reportedly,
IGF-1 signaling pathway is associated with crizotinib
resistance. The levels of IGF-1 appear to correlate
with cancer risk in human populations [27], and the
high contents of IGF-1 are associated with increased
mortality in the general population [28]. Elevated IGF-1
concentrations were observed in patients who had taken
crizotinib [29]. The amounts of IGF-1R were greater in
tumor biopsies taken at the time of acquired resistance
when compared to those obtained from the respective preresistant tumors. Also, the combination of crizotinib and an
IGF-1R inhibitor might be able to overcome this resistance
[15]. The downstream signaling pathway, Akt/mTOR/
S6 kinase pathway, was also associated with crizotinib
resistance [30]. The activation of the mTOR pathway
was related to increased autophagy of the ALK receptor,
leading to a weakened response to crizotinib treatment
[31]. A synergistic in vitro growth inhibitory effect was
established when an ALK inhibitor was combined with
an mTOR inhibitor [32]. Thus, we investigated whether
metformin overcomes crizotinib resistance through the
inhibition of the IGF-1R signaling pathway.
In the current study, we found that treatment with
metformin lowered the activation of IGF-1R signaling
pathway in both parental cells and H2228-CR cells.
In addition, metformin reversed the IGF-1-induced drug
resistance and decreased IGF-1R signaling activation.
Taken together, these findings suggest that metformin
reverses crizotinib resistance through the inhibition of the
IGF-1R signaling pathway.

Materials and Methods
Cell-lines and reagents
Crizotinib was a gift from Pfizer (PF-02341066)
and was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to
obtain a stock solution of 10 mM. Metformin (Sigma) was
dissolved in deionized water and stored at −20°C. The
recombinant human IGF-1 was purchased from PeproTech.
Crizotinib-sensitive H2228 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA)
and H3122 cells were obtained from Shanghai Bioleaf
Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured
in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RPMI1640, HyClone) with Earle’s salts, and supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine
solution (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin (HyClone) and
100 μg/ mL streptomycin sulfate (HyClone) at 37°C, with
5% CO2 in the air and 90% humidity.

Generation of crizotinib-resistant cell lines
Crizotinib-resistant cell lines were generated as
previously reported [33]. Generally, parental cells were
cultured with increasing concentrations of crizotinib.
The doses were augmented in a stepwise pattern when
normal cell proliferation resumed. Fresh drug was added
every 48–72 hours. Resistant cells that grew in 1 μM
crizotinib were derived after approximately eight months
of culturing in the continuous presence of the drug.

Limitations of the present study
There are several limitations in the present study.
First, this is an in vitro study, and complete differences
exist from identical in vivo trials, so more experiments
are needed in future studies to investigate the synergistic
anti-tumor effect of metformin and crizotinib in xenograft
models. Second, the possible molecular mechanisms
underlying primary and acquired crizotinib resistance may
differ. The two crizotinib-resistant sublines established

crizotinib and/or 5mM metformin were added to each
well as indicated, and the cells were further cultured for
48 h. Then, 10 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT reagent (Sigma) in
100 μL culture medium was added to each well. After
4 h, the medium was removed, and 150 μL of DMSO was
admixed to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals.
Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm by
using a ThermoFisher Spectrophotometer1510 (Molecular
Devices, Inc.). Cell viability was determined by dividing

triplicates.

temperature in the dark. Next, labeled cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry. All early apoptotic cells (i.e., Annexin
V-positive, PI-negative), necrotic/ late apoptotic cells
(i.e., double-positive), and living cells (i.e., doublenegative) were detected by using a Cytomics FC 500 flow
cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).

Colony-forming assay
The detailed procedures of colony formation assay
were described previously [34]. Briefly, 500 cells were
resuspended in culture medium and seeded in six-well
plates. After 14 days, the cells were washed and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde. Next, the cells were stained with
0.1% crystal violet. Colonies with a diameter greater than
1 mm were counted. Triplicate samples were used in the
experiment.

Ki67 incorporation assay
Cell proliferation was also assessed by the Ki67
incorporation assay using a Ki67 labeling and detection
kit (Sigma). Briefly, cells were treated with metformin
or crizotinib, or both, for 48 h, and then were incubated
for 6 h with Ki67 (1:200 dilution) and fixed. Cell nuclei
were counterstained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) and then viewed with a live cell station
(Delta Vision, API). At least 500 cells from three
independent experiments were counted. The data obtained
were expressed as the mean value of the percentage of
positive cells ± SEM.

Western blot assay
Cells grown and treated as indicated were collected,
and the total protein was extracted. The following
primary antibodies were used: rabbit monoclonal antiphosphorylated IGF-1R (Tyr1131), rabbit monoclonal
anti-IGF-1R, rabbit monoclonal anti-Akt, rabbit
monoclonal anti-phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), rabbit
monoclonal anti-phosphorylated mTOR (Ser2448),
rabbit monoclonal anti-mTOR, rabbit monoclonal antip70s6k, or rabbit monoclonal anti-phosphorylated p70s6k
(Thr389), rabbit monoclonal anti-S6, or rabbit monoclonal
anti-phosphorylated S6 (Ser240/244), rabbit monoclonal
anti-AMPK, or rabbit monoclonal anti-phosphorylated
AMPK (Thr172) (all from Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit
antibody (Thermo Scientific) was used as a secondary
antibody. The control for equal protein loading was
assessed with an anti-β-actin antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.).

Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion was measured by using 24-well
6.5-mm diameter inserts (8.0 μm pore size, Corning
Incorporated). The relative cell invasion index was
calculated as reported previously [17]. Triplicate samples
of 2 × 104 cells treated as indicated were seeded into the
upper well in serum-free medium and incubated with
10% FBS in the lower chambers. Cells were cultured for
48 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. The cells in the upper
chamber were then removed with a cotton swab, and those
that had migrated into the lower chamber were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% Crystal Violet.
The cells on the bottom side of the filters were counted in
5 random × 100 microscope objective fields.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± standard error of
the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses were carried out using
the unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test, and statistical
significance was assumed at an alpha value of p < 0.05.

Apoptosis assay
Flow cytometric analysis was employed to detect
apoptosis by examining altered plasma membrane
phospholipid packing by the lipophilic dye Annexin V.
Briefly, cells were treated with crizotinib and/or
metformin for 48 h, harvested by trypsin, washed twice
with PBS, and then resuspended at a density of 1 × 107
cells/mL. Thereafter, 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL
of propidium iodide (PI) were added to 100 μL of
the cell suspension and incubated for 30 min at room
