Abstract
Sensitivity to temozolomide is restricted to a subset of glioblastoma patients, with the major determinant of
resistance being a lack of promoter methylation of the gene encoding the repair protein DNA methyltransferase MGMT, although other mechanisms are thought to be active. There are, however, limited preclinical data in
model systems derived from pediatric glioma patients. We screened a series of cell lines for temozolomide efficacy
in vitro, and investigated the differential mechanisms of resistance involved. In the majority of cell lines, a lack of
MGMT promoter methylation and subsequent protein overexpression were linked to temozolomide resistance. An
exception was the pediatric glioblastoma line KNS42. Expression profiling data revealed a coordinated upregulation
of HOX gene expression in resistant lines, especially KNS42, which was reversed by phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway inhibition. High levels of HOXA9/HOXA10 gene expression were associated with a shorter survival in pediatric
high-grade glioma patient samples. Combination treatment in vitro of pathway inhibition and temozolomide resulted in a highly synergistic interaction in KNS42 cells. The resistance gene signature further included contiguous
genes within the 12q13-q14 amplicon, including the Akt enhancer PIKE, significantly overexpressed in the KNS42
line. These cells were also highly enriched for CD133 and other stem cell markers. We have thus shown an in vitro
link between phosphoinositide 3-kinase–mediated HOXA9/HOXA10 expression, and a drug-resistant, progenitor
cell phenotype in MGMT-independent pediatric glioblastoma. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9243–52. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma is the most common tumor of the central
nervous system, affecting patients of all ages, and being essentially refractory to treatment; the clinical outcome remains dismal regardless of age at diagnosis. The median
survival of a patient with glioblastoma is 15 months, and this
has improved little in the last four decades (1). The mainstays
of treatment during this time have been surgical resection and
radiotherapy, often with nitrosurea-based chemotherapy. The
use of adjuvant temozolomide has more recently emerged as
a new standard of care in glioblastoma, with concurrent and
sequential treatment in the initial therapy of patients resulting
in a modest improvement in median survival (2).

Temozolomide is a DNA methylating agent that is orally
bioavailable, crosses the blood:brain barrier, and exhibits
schedule-dependent antitumor activity (3). The improved
survival benefits in glioblastoma are largely restricted to
the subset of patients lacking expression of the DNA repair
enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyl-transferase (MGMT;
ref. 4). Temozolomide induces cytotoxic O6-guanine methyl
adducts that are removed directly by functional MGMT,
thereby producing drug resistance. Downregulation of
MGMT usually occurs in tumors by gene promoter hypermethylation, in which >50% methylation has been shown to
silence gene expression (5).
Deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) are also linked
to resistance to alkylating agents such as temozolomide (6), as
are elevated levels of Ape1/Ref-1, a major component of the
base excision repair (BER; ref. 7) system, with attempts to enhance temozolomide-induced cytotoxicity by disrupting BER
by means of inhibition of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase
(PARP) proving effective in vitro and in vivo (8).
The vast majority of the above work has taken place in adult
glioblastoma and preclinical models derived from adult patients.
In the pediatric setting, MGMT promoter hypermethylation
predicts for response to alkylating agents (9); however, the
survival of children treated with adjuvant temozolomide does
not seem to be improved when compared with historical
controls (10–14). The mechanisms of drug resistance in

pediatric high-grade glioma are poorly understood, in part
due to the lack of availability of suitable models of the disease.
We screened a series of pediatric and adult glioma cell lines for
temozolomide efficacy in vitro, and investigated the differential mechanisms of resistance involved, highlighting the involvement in pediatric cells of processes outside of the usual
MGMT/MMR/BER axis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Adult glioblastoma cell lines A172, LN229, SF268, U87MG,
U118MG, and U138MG, and pediatric glioma cell lines SF188,
KNS42, UW479, Res259, and Res186 were obtained and cul-

tured as previously described (15). For the spheroid formation assay, cells were grown in neurosphere medium, which
consisted of NDiff RHB-A medium (Stem Cell Sciences) supplemented with epidermal growth factor and fibroblast
growth factor 2, each at 20 ng/mL.
Growth inhibition studies
Temozolomide was obtained from Apin Chemicals, O6benzylguanine from Calbiochem, and PI-103 from Piramed
Pharma or synthesized in-house. Growth inhibition was determined using the sulforhodamine B (16) or MTS (17) assay
as previously described. To attempt reversion of resistance to
temozolomide, O6-benzylguanine was added at the highest
nontoxic concentration (10–15% of cell growth inhibition,

expression correlates with

exception of U87MG and KNS42
cells, which are hypermethylated,
do not express the protein, and are
resistant to temozolomide.

treated with MGMT substrate
analogue O6-benzylguanine,
showing the MGMT-dependent
nature of temozolomide (TMZ)
resistance in SF188, but not
KNS42 cells. Growth inhibition
was determined by the sulforhodamine
B assay. Concentration of
temozolomide is on a log10 scale.

were treated with increasing concentrations of drugs either
alone or concurrently at their equipotent molar ratio and
combination indices were calculated by the method of Chou
and Talalay (18). All values are given as mean ± SD of at least
three independent experiments.
Promoter methylation analysis
Cell line DNA was treated with sodium bisulphite using the
Epitect kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Methylation-specific (MS) PCR for the MGMT promoter
was performed as described previously (19). MS–multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was carried
out as previously reported (15) according to the manufacturer's instructions (MRC-Holland; ref. 20). HOXA9/HOXA10
methylation was assessed by comparing expression profiles
of 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine–treated cells with vehicle-treated
controls on Illumina Human-6 v2 Expression BeadChips (Illumina Inc.), ArrayExpress accession number E-TABM-858.
Western blot analysis
Immunodetection was performed as previously described
(15) using antibodies against MGMT (1:500; Zymed), MLH1

mRNA expression profiling analysis
Cell line expression profiling by Affymetrix U133 oligonucleotide arrays has been previously described (ref. 15; ArrayExpress
accession number E-TABM-579). Supervised analysis was performed using an absolute signal-to-noise metric of >1.5 in
GenePattern software (http://www.broad.mit.edu/cancer/
software/genepattern/). Coordinate gene regulation was identified using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; www.broad.
mit.edu/gsea/), with a nominal P value cutoff of 0.001. "Core
enriched" genes are defined as belonging to the leading-edge
subset within the gene set, and thus contribute the most to the
enrichment result. Assessment of HOX gene expression after
24-hour treatment with PI-103 at 5 × IC50 was carried out using
Illumina HT-12 BeadChips (ArrayExpress accession number
E-TABM-890). Affymetrix U133 expression data from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioblastoma study (21) was assessed for
cross-correlations of probesets corresponding to HOXA9 by
calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients in R. GSEA and
clinical correlations were further carried out on a published
dataset (22) of Affymetrix U133 expression array profiling of 78
pediatric high-grade gliomas (Gene Expression Omnibus accession number GSE19578; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry
CD133 protein expression was measured by both flow
cytometry using a BD fluorescence-activated cell sorting
Vantage SEDiVa system (BD Biosciences) and immunofluorescence on cytospin preparations, using anti-CD133 antibody
(AC133/1, Miltenyi Biotec) at 1:50 and 1:100 dilution, respectively. Cells were costained with nestin (196908, R & D Systems) and visualized with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Vector Laboratories Inc.). Cell cycle analysis was also
carried out by flow cytometry.

Results
Sensitivity of glioma cell lines to temozolomide
in vitro is largely but not exclusively dependent
on MGMT promoter methylation and lack
of protein expression
We first determined the response to temozolomide in vitro of
our panel of five pediatric (SF188, KNS42, UW479, Res259,
Res186) and six adult (A172, LN229, SF268, U87MG, U118MG,
U138MG) glioma cell lines. Four lines (A172, LN229, SF268,
Res259) were classed as temozolomide sensitive, with IC50 values of between 10 and 20 μmol/L (Fig. 1A). The remaining
cells were resistant to treatment with the alkylating agent,
with IC50 values of >500 μmol/L.
We assessed MGMT promoter methylation by methylationspecific PCR and MLPA, and protein expression by Western

blot (Fig. 1B). Extensive methylation resulted in an absence of
MGMT protein expression in LN229, A172, U87MG, SF268,
Res259, and KNS42 cells. There was, for the most part, a direct
correlation between MGMT methylation/lack of expression
and temozolomide sensitivity. An exception to this was the pediatric glioblastoma KNS42 cell line, which displayed insensitivity in the absence of MGMT protein, implying that alternate
mechanisms of resistance must be operative. To confirm this,
we treated pediatric glioblastoma SF188 and KNS42 cells
with temozolomide in the presence of the substrate analogue
O6-benzyl guanine (O6BeG), which depletes the enzyme and
increases cytotoxicity (ref. 23; Fig. 1C). Treatment with
20 μmol/L O6BeG increased the efficacy of temozolomide in
SF188 cells nearly 40-fold (IC50 without O6BeG = 194 μmol/L;
IC50 in the presence of O6BeG = 5 μmol/L), thus confirming the
dependence of these cells on MGMT in conferring temozolomide resistance. By contrast, no such effect was seen in
KNS42 cells, showing the MGMT-independent nature of
the insensitivity.
Dysregulation of MMR and BER proteins do not
explain resistance to temozolomide in
MGMT-deficient KNS42 cells
Enzymes involved in DNA MMR (MLH1, MLH3, MSH2,
MSH3, MSH6, PMS2) were evaluated by Western blot
(Fig. 2A). Although we identified three temozolomideresistant lines with abrogated expression of MSH3
(U138MG, UW479, and Res186), there was no deficiency
in KNS42 or U87MG cells. These data correlated well with levels
of promoter methylation assessed by MS-MLPA (15). We further
investigated components of the BER pathway, including
PARP1/2, XRCC1, and APE1. Although temozolomide-resistant
UW479 and Res186 seemed to lack PARP1/2 and XRCC1
expression, there were no apparent alterations in other glioma
lines, including KNS42 or U87MG (Fig. 2B).
Identification of a HOX/stem cell gene expression
signature associated with temozolomide resistance
in pediatric glioblastoma cells
Using expression microarrays, we identified 135 genes differentially expressed between sensitive and resistant glioma cell
lines (Fig. 3A). Included in this list were MGMT and PARP2, despite these enzymes not explaining the resistance in all cell
lines. Also included were several kinases, including MAPK9
and CDK6, which may prove suitable targets for pharmacologic
modulation; PIK3C3 (Vps34), suggesting a possible link to the
autophagic response (24); and genes encoding elements of the
immune response such as IL10 and IL16.

When we applied GSEA to our data, we observed coordinated differential expression of the HOX_GENES set
(MSigDB C2:curated gene sets) in resistant versus sensitive
cell lines (Fig. 3B), with an enrichment score of 0.54 [nominal
P = 0.01; false discovery rate (FDR) q = 0.403]. Furthermore,
the HOX_GENES list was also identified as significant using
a GSEA “Preranked” analysis based on differentially expressed
genes between KNS42 alone and temozolomide-sensitive
cell lines (Fig. 3C). In these analyses, the genes in both coreenriched lists, which contribute to the leading-edge subset
within the gene set (25), included HOXA9, HOXA10, HOXB13,
HOXC4, HOXC10, HOXC11, HOXC13, HOXD1, and GBX2.
As coordinated expression of HOX genes had recently
been noted in glioblastoma clinical samples (26), and was
reported as evidence of a “self-renewal” signature as it
included the stem cell marker PROM1 (CD133), we sought
further evidence for this in a published glioblastoma dataset
and our cell line models. When we investigated TCGA expression profiles of 163 glioblastomas for genes that correlated
with the top-ranking HOX gene in our KNS42 GSEA list,
HOXA9, we noted a remarkable parallel expression of numerous other homeobox genes (Fig. 4A). Of the top 47 genes
by this analysis, 18 were homeobox genes found at 9 distinct
genomic loci, and 7 were included in the self-renewal
signature of Murat and colleagues (26). These latter genes
included PROM1. Intriguingly, the vast majority of the
non–homeobox genes identified by this analysis are contiguous genes found commonly amplified in glioblastoma at the
genomic locus 12q13-q14.
To determine whether an enrichment of the stem cell
marker CD133 may be playing a role in the resistance of
KNS42 cells to temozolomide, we assessed the levels of mRNA
expression relative to the other cell lines (Fig. 4B), and noted
considerably higher levels of PROM1 in KNS42 cells than in any
other line in our panel. Of note, the only other two cell lines to
express PROM1 at above background levels were the similarly
temozolomide-resistant U87MG and SF188. This was visualized by immunofluorescent staining for CD133, colabeled with
nestin (Fig. 4C). We had previously reported the relatively high
levels of stem cell markers in SF188 and KNS42 by immunocytochemistry (15), and to more accurately quantify this, we
used the more sensitive flow cytometry analysis to reveal an
usually high degree of expression in KNS42, with 17.0% of cells
positive for CD133. There were also high levels of CD133-positive cells in the SF188 line (4.8%) compared with 0.0% to 0.02%
in other cell lines. KNS42 cells grown as monolayers also expressed by far the greatest levels of other stem cell markers
such as nestin, SOX2, and musashi-1 (Affymetrix U133, data

not shown). Consistent with the cancer stem/progenitor cell–
associated gene expression profile, neurosphere formation
assays showed that KNS42 cells form tight three-dimensional
spheroids, which may be serially passaged and undergo selfrenewal. In contrast, SF188 cells form smaller, more loosely
packed spheres, whereas U87MG grow as cell aggregates rather
than neurospheres per se. Neither UW479, Res259, nor Res186
formed spheres under these conditions. Taken together, KNS42
cells seem to have a significant cancer stem/progenitor cell–
associated gene expression signature and biological phenotype.
Expression of HOXA9/HOXA10 is a result of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase–mediated demethylation,
inhibition of which synergistically interacts with
temozolomide in KNS42 cells
Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine
resulted in highly differential levels of expression of HOXA9

and HOXA10 in all pediatric cell lines with the exception of
KNS42, in which no changes were observed, indicative of a
lack of methylation in the untreated cells (Fig. 5A). As a recent
study has proposed a mechanism for this observation whereby
transcriptional activation of the HOXA cluster is reversible by
a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor through an epigenetic mechanism involving histone H3K27 trimethylation
(27), we sought to investigate whether this mechanism was
active in our system. Treatment for 1, 8, and 24 hours with
the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 (28–30) at 5 × IC50
resulted in significantly reduced expression of both HOXA9
and HOXA10 in KNS42 cells in a time-dependent manner
(Fig. 5B). These effects were not due to fluctuations in HOX gene
expression with the cell cycle, as diminished HOXA9/HOXA10
was observed as early as one hour posttreatment, at which
time there was no evidence of G1 arrest (Fig. 5C), despite inhibition of PI3K as seen by reduced phospho-Akt levels (Fig. 5D).

Temozolomide Resistance in Pediatric Glioma

Figure 5. HOXA9/HOXA10 expression in KNS42 cells is driven by a lack of promoter methylation in a PI3K-dependent manner. A, relative mRNA expression
levels of HOXA9 and HOXA10 before and after treatment with 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine in pediatric glioma cell lines. An absence of expression changes after
5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment in KNS42 cells is indicative of an absence of constitutive promoter methylation. B, HOXA9/HOXA10 expression is reduced by
treatment with PI-103 in KNS42 cells in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 at 5 × IC50 for 1, 8, and 24 hours led to a
reduction in expression of both HOXA9 and HOXA10 in KNS42 cells as early as 1 hour posttreatment. C, Western blot analysis of phospho- and total Akt after
treatment of KNS42 cells with PI-103 at 5 × IC50 for 1, 8, and 24 hours. Inhibition of PI3K signaling is observed at the earliest time point. D, cell cycle analysis
of KNS42 cells after treatment with PI-103 at 5 × IC50 for 1, 8, and 24 hours. There was no G1 arrest evident at the early time points at which reduced HOXA9/
HOXA10 expression was observed. E, Western blot analysis of PI3K regulatory and catalytic subunits and enhancers in pediatric glioma cells. Expression of the
specific Akt enhancer proteins PIKE-A and PIKE-L were considerably elevated in KNS42 cells compared with other pediatric glioma cells. F, synergistic interaction
of PI-103 and temozolomide (TMZ). Cotreatment with PI-103 and temozolomide resulted in a high degree of synergy in MGMT-independent KNS42 cells
(combination index = 0.43) as calculated by the median effect analysis. By contrast, SF188 cells showed an antagonistic interaction (combination index = 1.401).

Next we sought to determine whether there was any specific dysregulation of the PI3K/PTEN system in KNS42 cells
that may be responsible for the HOX gene overexpression.
Mutation screening for PTEN, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and PIK3R3
did not identify any sequence variations (data not shown),
and Western blot analysis confirmed a lack of overexpression
of PI3K regulatory and catalytic subunits (Fig. 5E). By contrast, there were significantly elevated levels of the enhancer
proteins PIKE-A and especially PIKE-L in KNS42 cells in
comparison with the other lines. Both PIKE proteins are encoded by the CENTG1 (AGAP2) gene found within the 12q13q14 amplicon coordinately upregulated in association with
the HOX cluster, and likely represent a significant target for
this genomic event in human glioblastoma.
Finally, we investigated the efficacy of targeting PI3K as a
strategy for overcoming temozolomide resistance in our pediatric glioma cells. Combination treatment in vitro of temozolomide with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103
resulted in a highly synergistic interaction in KNS42 as measured by median effect analysis (combination index = 0.43;
Fig. 5F). By contrast, in SF188 cells an antagonistic response
was observed with the same combination (combination
index = 1.40).

HOXA9/HOXA10 expression is associated with shorter
survival in pediatric high-grade glioma patients
To assess the translational relevance of HOX gene expression in pediatric high-grade glioma patient samples, we examined published data detailing expression profiles of 78
tumors arising in childhood (22). Although the number of
long-term (>3 years) survivors is small, we identified 49 genes
that were differentially expressed between patients with long
and short (<1 year) overall survival (Fig. 6A). Included in this
list were HOXA2, HOXA5, HOX7, and HOXA9. By applying
GSEA to the dataset, we identified coordinated upregulation
in the short-term survivors of genes at the chromosome 7p15
cytoband, with an enrichment score of 0.68 (nominal P < 0.001)
albeit with a high false discovery rate value (FDR q = 0.930).
With the HOXA cluster found at this locus, running GSEA on
the HOXA gene list itself gave a highly significant enrichment
score of 0.90 (nominal P < 0.001, FDR q < 0.001; Fig. 6B). There
was considerable correlation between gene expression of all
members of the HOXA family in the pediatric samples (Pearson's
correlation coefficients 0.03–0.90). Taking the values of HOXA9
and HOXA10, and segregating samples into “high” and “low”
expressers (combined expression greater or less than the
75th percentile of all values, respectively), we showed a

Discussion
Promoter methylation of the MGMT gene is generally accepted as the major determinant of sensitivity to the alkylating agent temozolomide in glioblastoma cells, and as such
has major significance in the treatment of these patients.
We identified the pediatric glioblastoma cell line KNS42 to
be resistant to temozolomide in vitro despite an absence of
MGMT expression, a competent MMR system, and an intact
double-strand break repair pathway. Clues as to the mechanism of resistance in these cells may help in identifying factors that contribute to childhood glioblastoma patients who
remain refractory to temozolomide treatment.

Gene expression profiling of a panel of pediatric and adult
glioma cell lines highlighted coordinated expression of numerous HOX genes in the resistant cell lines, most especially
KNS42, and provided in vitro model system evidence in support of data from temozolomide-treated adult glioblastoma
patients (26). Using a similar expression profiling and GSEA
approach, Murat and coworkers identified a HOX-dominated
gene cluster as an independent predictive factor of resistance. Integrating the core gene lists of the present study
to that dataset highlights HOXA9 and HOXA10 as the key effectors in both systems. This converges with a recent study
identifying the HOXA cluster, and HOXA9 in particular, to be
independent negative prognostic markers in adult glioblastoma (27). Herein we provide evidence for an additional
prognostic role in pediatric high-grade glioma.
HOX genes are essential in axis determination during embryonic development and are known to be involved in cancer,
including glioblastomas (31, 32); it is not immediately
apparent, however, what role they may play in resistance to

Temozolomide Resistance in Pediatric Glioma

alkylating agents. Costa and colleagues propose that HOXA9
exerts antiapoptotic and proproliferative effects after upregulation via an epigenetic mechanism controlled by PI3K and
independent of mTOR (27). Our findings confirm this observation, and add to previous evidence showing the synergistic interactions of temozolomide and PI3K pathway inhibitors in
in vitro and in vivo models of adult glioblastoma (33); this
combination may therefore also be beneficial in glioblastoma
patients with a MGMT-independent HOX gene signatureassociated mechanism of resistance to temozolomide.
Murat and colleagues suggested strong HOXA10 expression
in glioblastoma-derived neurospheres to be in line with a role
of HOX genes in the glioma stem-like cell compartment, and
showed that the resistance signature as a whole is evocative of
self-renewal (26). Of note is the presence of a high proportion
(17.0%) of CD133-positive cells present in our KNS42 cell
monolayer cultures, with additional expression of other stem
cell markers in coordination with the HOX gene signature.
Such a HOX/stem cell signature was also found to be tightly
regulated in an analysis of TCGA glioblastoma expression data
(21). The pediatric glioblastoma cell line KNS42 may be an excellent experimental model for investigating such interactions
with MGMT-independent treatment failure.
We also found a remarkable link between the HOX/stem
cell signature and coordinated overexpression of genes within the CDK4 amplicon at 12q13-q14 in glioblastoma patient
samples. This association was also present, and correlated
with poor response to temozolomide chemoradiotherapy,
in the Murat and colleagues dataset (26). Here we provide
a possible mechanism for this coexpression of HOX and
12q13-q14 genes in the form of overexpression of the Akt enhancer PIKE (CENTG1, AGAP2), also present at very high levels in the unamplified KNS42 cells, which may drive the
changes in H3K27 methylation of the HOXA cluster mediated
via PI3K pathway signaling (27).

It is apparent that a variety of processes, not all involving
repair or tolerance of alkyl lesions, may promote alkylator resistance (23). Along with providing therapeutic guidance for
those patients whose tumors are intrinsically resistant to
treatment, characterization of additional determinants of resistance is necessary to develop new targets for therapy in
tumors that acquire resistance to temozolomide in vivo in
the presence of hypermethylated MGMT.
