ABSTRACT
Curcumin is a novel drug for lung cancer treatment. However, the mechanism
underlying the anti-tumor effect of curcumin remains elusive. Previous evidences
indicated that, the methylating transferase DNMT1 is downregulated by curcumin,
and the transcription factor 21 (TCF21) is suppressed by DNMT1. We hereby attempt
to elucidate the correlation between curcumin treatment and TCF21 expression.
Exosomes derived from curcumin-pretreated H1299 cells were used to treat BEAS-2B
cells, which induced proliferation, colony formation and migration of BEAS-2B cells.
An increase in TCF21 expression in response to curcumin was also seen, as revealed
by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot. Analysis using the GEO database (access
#GSE21210) indicated that a positive correlation existed between TCF21 levels and
lung cancer patient survival. TCF21 overexpression and knockdown was introduced
to H1299 cells through lentiviral system, which led to suppression and promotion
of tumor growth, respectively. We also demonstrated that DNMT1 expression was
downregulated by curcumin. Therefore, curcumin exerts its anti-cancer function by
downregulating DNMT1, thereby upregulating TCF21.

The anti-tumor role of curcumin is associated with
DNA hypomethylation, which epigenetically controls
gene transcription and genome stability [5–7]. Curcumin
abrogates the catalytic activity of a methyltransferase,
DNMT1, thereby affecting the methylation of a number
of cancer-related genes [8–11]. TCF21, which can be
inhibited by methylation, promotes mesenchymal to
epithelial transition (MET) during organogenesis [12].
The reversal of MET, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), is a primary driver for cancer progression. Thus,
the loss or reduced expression of TCF21 has been reported
as a signature for malignant cancers [13, 14]. However,
studies on TCF21 as a biomarker in lung cancer are still
rare. Considering the demethylating activity of curcumin,
there is possibility that the anti-tumor function of
curcumin resides in the upregulation of TCF21.
Herein, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory
role of curcumin in lung cancer, with particular interest

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide and constitutes a major public health
problem [1]. Effective therapy against lung cancer is
of paramount importance to improve prognosis and
survival of lung cancer patients. Resistance to existing
chemotherapy drugs poses a serious challenge to
lung cancer therapy, necessitating the development
of new drugs against lung cancer. To date, a number
of plant-derived anti-cancer compounds have been
discovered [2]. One of them is curcumin, also known
as diferuloylmethane, which is a phenolic compound
isolated from Curcuma longa [3, 4]. Curcumin is well
tolerated in high doses, and has been found to exert antiinflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. However, the
precise mechanism underlying the action of this drug in
cancer is still unclear.

RESULTS

in the link between curcumin and TCF21 expression.
Here we focused on exosomes, which serve as delivery
vehicles for miRNAs, anti-inflammatory agents, neural
transmitters, etc. Delivered and released by exosomes,
curcumin exerts an enhanced anti-cancer potency due
to increased curcumin concentrations in recipient
cells [15]. Furthermore, curcumin may also impair the
tumor-promoting function of tumor-derived exosomes.
Therefore, instead of directly using curcumin, we
isolated exosomes derived from curcumin-pretreated
lung cancer cells, to study curcumin’s anti-cancer effect.
To our knowledge, it is the first time that curcumin is
shown to exert anti-cancer effects by upregulating
TCF21. We also show that downregulation of TCF21
is associated with poor survival of lung cancer patients.
On the other hand, overexpressing TCF21 inhibits tumor
growth in a H1299 mouse tumor model. Our results
may unravel the mechanism of curcumin action in lung
cancer, and give rise to new diagnostic and therapeutic
strategies for lung cancer.

Exosomes from curcumin-treated H1299 cells
possess anti-tumor activity
To specifically study the anti-tumor activity of
curcumin-enriched exosomes in lung cancer cells, we
isolated exosomes from H1299 cells that were cultured
in medium containing 10 μM curcumin for 48 h. This
generated exosomes containing high concentrations of
curcumin. BEAS-2B cells were then incubated with
these exosomes, followed by monitoring changes in cell
proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion.
As a control, BEAS-2B cells were also incubated with
exosomes generated from DMSO-treated H1299 cells. As
shown in Figure 1, exosome-containing curcumin clearly
induced a decrease in cell viability (Figure 1A, P<0.01),
colony formation (Figure 1B, P<0.01), migration and
invasion (Figure 1C and 1D).

Figure 1: Curcumin treated exosome inhibit the exosomal development of lung cancer. H1299 cells were treated with 10

μM curcumin or DMSO and after 48h the exosomes were collected from the supernatant of the cells. BEAS-2B cells were cultured with
the exosomes respectively. A. CCK-8 assay was used to detect BEAS-2B cell viability. Data were presented as mean+SD from three

Curcumin upregulates exosomal TCF21 in lung
cancer cells

with increasing duration of Exo./curcumin incubation
(Figure 2C), as well as with the increasing concentration
of curcumin (Figure 2D). Collectively, these data indicated
that TCF21 upregulation was correlated with Exo./
curcumin incubation. The role of curcumin in upregulating
TCF21 was further validated in vivo. Tumors were
initiated by injecting H1299 cells subcutaneously into
nude mice, which then received either vehicle treatment
or 300 mg/kg curcumin daily for 24 days. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S1, TCF21 expression in curcumintreated mice was significantly higher than those treated
with vehicle, which again verified that curcumin was able
to upregulate TCF21 expression.

We next examined the correlation between exosomal
TCF21 levels and curcumin. RT-PCR analysis indicated
that downregulation of TCF21 was a characteristic of
aggressive lung cancer, and the TCF21 levels were
inversely correlated with the aggressiveness of cancer
cells (aggressiveness: BEAS-2B < A549 < PC9 < H1299)
(Figure 2A). Despite the difference in TCF21 basal
expression, curcumin-containing exosomes universally
upregulated TCF21 expression in these cells (Figure 2B).
In H1299 cells, the TCF21 expression was upregulated

TCF21 is a positive biomarker in lung cancer
prognosis

the positive correlation between TCF21 expression and
patient survival.

To confirm that TCF21 is a prognostic biomarker
in lung cancer patients, we examined the NCBI GEO
database (access #GSE31210), which contains a large
number of expression profiles of lung cancer patients, in
search for correlation between TCF21 and patient survival.
Clearly, low TCF21 expression is associated with poor
survival of lung cancer (Figure 3A). The Kaplan-Meier
plot indicated the same trend (Figure 3B), suggesting that
TCF21 is an effective biomarker of patient survival.

Downregulation of DNMT1 by curcumin is
essential for the upregulation of TCF21
We next investigated whether DNMT1 expression
was regulated by curcumin. As shown in Figure 5A,
curcumin was able to downregulate DNMT1 expression
in BEAS-2B, A549, PC9, and H1299 cells. This
downregulation was enhanced with longer duration of
curcumin treatment (Figure 5B). Western blot analysis
indicated that higher concentration of curcumin further
lowered the DNMT1 levels (Figure 5C). Thus, DNMT1
downregulation was mediated by curcumin, in time- and
dose-dependent manners. To confirm the correlation
between TCF21 and DNMT1, we performed DNMT1
knockdown, which led to downregulation of DNMT1
protein expression (Figure 5D) and an over 6-fold
upregulation of TCF21 mRNA (P<0.01; Figure 5E).
Methylation-specific PCR was also performed to examined
the methylation levels of TCF21 promoters. Transfection
of shDNMT1 induced a downregulation of methylated
TCF21 promoter, as opposed to the upregulation of
unmethylated TCF21 promoter, which is in accordance
to the methylation function of DNMT1 (Figure 5F).
Collectively, these data supported the causal relationship
between curcumin regulation and DNMT1 methylation of
TCF21.

TCF21 coordinates with curcumin to suppress
lung cancer
Provided that TCF21 downregulation is an indicator
of malignant lung cancer, we next investigated how TCF21
overexpression and knockdown would alter the growth of
cancer cells. TCF21-expressing plasmid was transfected
into H1299 cells through lentivirus to induced TCF21
overexpression, and shTCF21 was introduced using
Lipofectamine 2000. These studies were performed in
the presence and absence of Exo./curcumin, respectively.
As expected, curcumin and TCF21 individually exerted
similar inhibitory effect on these cancer cells (Figure
4). Exo./cucumin and shTCF21 synergistically exerted
inhibitory effects on cancer cells, resulting the lowest
proliferation, colony formation and migration among all
experimental groups (Figure 4). Furthermore, we tested if
TCF21 knockdown induced curcumin resistance in vivo.
As indicated in Supplementary Figure S2, a substantially
higher tumor growth rate was observed in mice that
received both shTCF21 and curcumin, compared to mice
that received only curcumin, which was consistent with

Tumor suppressing role of TCF21
To explore the inhibitory role of TCF21 in vivo,
we established TCF21 overexpressing H1299 cell lines
through lentivirus transfection of TCF21 expressing

plasmid. RT-PCR revealed that the cells transfected with
TCF21 expressing plasmid possessed approximately 30
times higher TCF21 level than those transfected with
lentivirus vector (Figure 6A). After inoculation, we
observed that cells with TCF21 overexpression showed a
much lower growth rate than those expressing lentivirus
vector (P<0.01), as evident by smaller tumor size (Figure
6B and 6C) and lower tumor weight (Figure 6D). All these
data pointed to the conclusion that TCF21 greatly reduced
tumor growth in a mouse model.

the notion that chemotherapy drugs may exert their anticancer effects via exosomes. Tumor-derived exosomes,
in most cases, take pro-tumorigenic roles in cancer by
exhibiting immunosuppressive properties and transporting
RNAs/proteins; it may also interfere with cytotoxic
effect of chemotherapy drugs through drug exportation
[16]. Nevertheless, exosomes can also act as treatment
response markers since effective cancer therapy is possibly
facilitated by reducing exosome secretion and/or inhibiting
exosome functions [17]. In fact, removal of exosomes has
been proposed as an effective therapeutic strategy for
cancers [18]. It is also worth noting that tumor-derived
exosomes encapsulate curcumin. As a result, curcumin is
transported to recipient cells at a high local concentration,
thereby enhancing its anti-cancer effects. These curcumincarrying exosomes distribute curcumin in blood

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we showed that exosomes
isolated from curcumin-pretreated H1299 cells exhibited
anti-tumor activity. These findings are consistent with

circulation, and protect curcumin from biodegradation,
improving the in vivo bioavailability. Inspired by this,
exosomes have been developed as a curcumin delivery
system to exert anti-inflammatory effects [15]. Besides,
exosomes were also used for delivering siRNA, miRNA,
DNA and drugs [19, 20]. These naturally occurring,
endogenous nanoparticles are advantageous over artificial
nanoparticles in minimized antigenicity, enhanced stability
and higher safety.
We confirmed that TCF21 is a biomarker for
lung cancer. Previously, downregulation of TCF21 was
demonstrated to be associated with poor survival in clear
cell renal cell carcinoma [13], urological cancer [21], head
and neck cancer [22], gastric cancer [23] and lung cancer
[24]. Here, we validated the diagnostic value of TCF21 in
lung cancer by showing that TCF21 downregulation is a
characteristic of lung cancer patients with poor survival.

Accordingly, TCF21 overexpression and suppression had
pro-tumorigenic and tumor-suppressive effects, respectively.
Importantly, Exo./curcumin treatment upregulated TCF21,
suggesting that the TCF21 is involved in the anti-cancer
effect of curcumin. TCF21 downregulation is associated
with EMT, a process that generates cancer stem cells
(CSC) and promotes cancer cell migration, invasion and
metastasis. By promoting TCF21 expression, curcumin
impairs tumor progression by inhibiting the emergence
of cancer stem cells, thereby containing the cancer
dissemination. Moreover, it is widely accepted that EMT is
involved in cancer resistance [25]. It is possible that TCF21
downregulation is associated with the drug resistance of
lung cancer. Thus, detection of the methylated TCF21
levels is a promising approach to determine lung cancer
risk, in order to improve the clinical management of lung
cancer. In addition, upregulating TCF21 expression is a

viable strategy for suppressing lung cancer progression. We
showed that H1299 cells overexpressing TCF21 exhibited
a slower tumor growth than normal H1299 in vivo. In line
with this result, we speculated that delivery of TCF21expressing plasmids intravenously to tumor tissue would
also exert tumor inhibitory effects. Indeed, various early
studies have reported that DNA-delivery systems have
enabled overexpression or knockdown of cancer-specific
genes to suppress tumor growth [26–28]. Since TCF21
is constitutively highly expressed in normal cells, this
strategy is superior than conventional chemotherapy, in that
it would not cause toxicity to normal tissues. Furthermore,
TCF21-based gene therapy can be combined with curcumin
treatment to synergistically maximize the therapeutic
effects.
As promoter methylation is the primary mechanism
of TCF21 regulation, and curcumin covalently binds to
DNMT1, we sought to validate the link between DNMT1
and TCF21. First, we recapitulated that DNMT1 was
downregulated by curcumin treatment; we then showed that

knockdown of DNMT1 upregulated TCF21 expression.
In this regard, silencing DNMT1 with shRNA is another
approach to inhibit tumors. This result is consistent with
previous report that aberrant methylation was associated
with enhanced lung cancer progression [29].
In summary, we hereby report that TCF21 is a
putative diagnostic and therapeutic target in lung cancer.
Furthermore, we showed that curcumin downregulated
DNMT1 to promote TCF21 expression. Our findings
could support further development of diagnostic and
therapeutic approaches for lung cancer based on curcumin.

rate of cells refilling the gap areas. For transwell matrigel
invasion assay, cells were plated in the upper chamber of
the transwell apparatus (Corning Costar, Corning, NY),
the bottom of which was coated with matrigel. Cells
that migrated at the lower chamber were fixed. MTT
containing medium was added to the cells, and incubated
for 4 hours. Subsequently, medium was removed and
DMSO was added to dissolve the formazon crystal formed
in cells. Measurement of absorbance at 570 nm was used
to calculate the number of cells.

Curcumin treatment and exosomes extraction
Curcumin powder was dissolved and added
to culture medium at the concentration of 10 μM for
different durations, ranging from 24 to 72 h. This
concentration and treatment duration was chosen based
on a previous protocol [30]. For dose-dependent study,
cells were also exposed to 5 μM study for 24 h. As a
control, cells were treated with DMSO. Cells were
grown until reaching 90% confluency, and washed
with PBS, followed by incubating with fresh complete
media free of exosomes supplemented with FBS for 2
days. Briefly, isolation of exosomes were performed
by differential centrifugation at 4°C in conditioned
medium, first at 300 g for 10 min, then at 2,000 g for 20
min, followed by filtration with a 220 μm filter for cell
debris removal. The exosomes were then pelleted at 4°C
by centrifugation at 100,000 g for 90 min. Pellets were
re-suspended in PBS and centrifuged again at 100,000
g for another 90 min. Measurements of the size and
concentration of the exosomes were performed using
qNano (Izon Science, New Zealand), which were then
ready for RNA or protein extraction.

RT-PCR and western blot
Cells cultured to approximately 80% confluency in
6-well plates were harvested by trypsinization. Extraction
of total RNA was performed with the TRIzol® Reagents
extraction kit (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA, USA).
Synthesis of cDNA was performed using the Maxima H
Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher).
Real-time PCR was performed using the MasterCycler
RealPlex 4 from Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). The
SYBR Green Master Mix was used for PCR reaction.
Quantification of mRNA level was using the 2-ΔΔT method.
For western blot, cells were lysed with T-PER
Tissue Protein Extract Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
supplemented with Proteinase Inhibitor Cocktail
(Invitrogen) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF,
Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). Protein lysates of 30 μg
was loaded into Mini-PROTEAN® Precast Gel (4-20%),
which was used for SDS-PAGE using the Tetra Vertical
Electrophoresis Cell (Biorad). Resolved proteins were
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated
with antibodies according to standard procedures.
Antibodies used in this study included: rabbit anitTCF21 (ab32981, Abcam), rabbit anti-GAPDH (ab37168,
Abcam), and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (ab6721,
Abcam).

Cell viability, colony formation, and migration
assays
Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay was used to
assess cell viability. Cells were first seeded in 96-well
plates. CCK-8 solution was added to each well followed
by incubation for 2 h. Cell viability was measured
based on the absorbance at 450 nm. To evaluate colonyforming ability of cells, cells were firstly trypsinized and
the resulted solution was passed through cell strainer to
produce single-cell suspensions. Then cells were plated
in 6-well plates coated with soft agar at the density of 50
cm-12. Two milliliters of culture medium was added into
each well. Cells were cultured for 3 days before fixed
with staining with 6% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% crystal
violet. Plates were subsequently allowed to dry with air
at room temperature. Colony counting was performed
using a stereomicroscope. Migratory ability of cells
were evaluated with scratch wound assay and transwell
matrigel invasion assay. For scratch wound assay, cells
at the confluency of over 80% were subjected to scratch
with a 10 μL pipette tip. The gap areas immediately
after gaps were made and at 24 h after scratching were
documented by capturing images of the gap using a
microscope. Migratory ability was correlated with the

is a signature for lung cancer patients with a poor survival.
The dataset with access number of GSE21210, which
contains a larger cohort of lung cancer patients (n=102),
was used for data analysis.

dish until 50% confluence. Transfection was done
in DMEM medium, co-transfecting with packaging
vectors and Mission Lentiviral packaging mix (SigmaAldrich) and Lipofectamine 2000 agent (Invitrogen).
Virons that produced at 24 h-incubation were purified
with centrifugation at 3000 rpm and filtration through a
