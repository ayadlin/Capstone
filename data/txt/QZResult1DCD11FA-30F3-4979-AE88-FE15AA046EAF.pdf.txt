Abstract
The transcription factor NF-κB is required for lymphocyte activation and proliferation as well as the
survival of certain lymphoma types1, 2. Antigen receptor stimulation assembles an NF-κB activating
platform containing the scaffold protein CARMA1/CARD11, the adaptor BCL10, and the
paracaspase MALT1 (CBM complex), linked to the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK) complex3–
12, but signal transduction is not fully understood1. We conducted parallel screens involving a mass

spectrometry analysis of CARMA1 binding partners and an RNAi screen for growth inhibition of
the CBM-dependent “activated B cell-like” (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL)12. Here, we report that both screens identified casein kinase 1α (CK1α) as a bifunctional
regulator of NF-κB. CK1α dynamically associates with the CBM complex upon T cell receptor (TCR)
engagement to augment cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation. However, CK1α kinase
activity plays a counterposing role by subsequently promoting the phosphorylation and inactivation
of CARMA1. CK1α has thus a dual “gating” function which first promotes and then terminates
receptor-induced NF-κB. ABC DLBCL cells required CK1α for constitutive NF-κB activity
indicating that CK1α functions as a “conditionally essential malignancy” (CEMal) gene - a member
of a new class of potential cancer therapeutic targets.
To better understand signal regulation by the CBM complex, we performed a mass
spectrometry proteomic screen following CARMA1 immunoprecipitation. Sixteen peptides
covering 54% of CK1α were isolated from an excised band (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig.
1). CK1α belongs to the CK1 family of serine/threonine protein kinases, which regulates

developmental and homeostatic processes including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and circadian
rhythm13. Co-immunoprecipitations in HEK293T cells showed that HA-tagged CK1α
interacted with V5-CARMA1 (Fig. 1b). CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1 associated with
CK1α following TCR stimulation in Jurkat T lymphocytes, and in BJAB B cells stimulated
with PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 1c–e). Notably, phosphorylated forms of BCL10 and
ubiquitinated species of MALT1, modifications due to signaling14, associated with CK1α.
Moreover, MALT1 and BCL10 precipitations revealed TCR-induced recruitment of CK1α
concomitantly with IKKβ and phosphorylated-IKKβ (P-IKKβ)(Fig. 1d and data not shown).
Also, cytosolic CK1α reorganized into punctate structures that colocalized with CD3 clusters
upon TCR activation (Fig. 1f), suggesting an association with CBM components within
membrane microdomains2, 15. In contrast to TCR agonists, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
which does not employ the CBM, induced no interaction between CK1α and CBM substituents
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Lastly, antibody depletion of CK1α from cell lysates removed nearly
the entire active CBM complex (Supplemental Fig. 3). Hence, CK1α is a new component
selectively entering the active CBM after antigen receptor stimulation.
CK1α harbors a short and unique carboxy-terminal portion attached to the conserved kinase
domain13 (Fig. 1a). Removing this region (Δ283-337) abolished CK1α binding to CARMA1

(Fig. 1g). In addition, the human (residues 283-337) and mouse (283-325) CK1α C-terminal
domains were sufficient, with Y292 and D293 as the key residues, for CARMA1 association
(Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 4a, and 4b). We also found that both the coiled-coil (CC) and
linker regions (CCL) of CARMA1 together were critical for CK1α binding. (Fig. 1i, and
Supplementary Fig. 4c).
The CBM complex is an obligate gateway from lymphocyte antigen receptors to NF-κB
activation1, 3, 8–11. To define the functional importance of CK1α, we first decreased its
endogenous levels by RNA interference in primary human T cells. CK1α silencing reduced
TCR-induced interleukin-2 (IL-2) production as did silencing of NF-κB p65 and BCL10 (Fig.
2a). This was accompanied by diminished IL-2 receptor (CD25) up-regulation, and reduced
proliferation (Fig. 2b). In Jurkat cells, CK1α knockdown with small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) decreased the TCR induction of an NF-κB luciferase reporter as efficiently as a
BCL10 siRNA (Fig. 2c). Again, TNF-α-mediated NF-κB was unaffected, underscoring the
selective involvement of CK1α in the TCR-NF-κB pathway. Accordingly, CK1α-silenced
primary T cells and Jurkat also displayed diminished p65 NF-κB nuclear translocation
following TCR, but not TNF-α stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). By contrast, NF-κB
activation proceeded normally when CK1δ- or CK1ε were reduced (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Thus, among the CK1s, CK1α provides an essential, non-redundant function in regulating
TCR-induced NF-κB activation.

To achieve a better knockdown, single Jurkat clones stably expressing a small hairpin RNA
(shRNA) against CK1α were generated. As expected, NF-κB activation was dramatically
reduced upon stimulation, as IκBα phosphorylation and degradation were inhibited (Fig. 2d–
f). Other early TCR signaling events, such as ERK1/2 phosphorylation, overall tyrosine
phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, and NF-AT activation occurred normally (Fig. 2e, and
Supplementary Fig. 5d–f). Of note, NF-κB activity was restored when CK1α-silenced cells
were rescued with ectopic mouse CK1α (mCK1α), but not with mCK1α mutants lacking
CARMA1 binding ability, suggesting that CK1α function requires association with CARMA1
(Fig. 2d, and Supplemental Fig. 7). Hence, CK1α is selectively required for optimal
physiological activation of NF-κB upon TCR stimulation in normal lymphocytes.
Promptly following TCR ligation, PKCθ phosphorylates CARMA1 and unleashes its adaptor
functions16, 17. CARMA1 then promotes IκBα phosphorylation by recruiting signaling
molecules, including BCL10, MALT1, and IKK17, 18. Although IKK was phosphorylated

following stimulation of CK1α-silenced cells, P-IKKβ was no longer recruited to CBM (Fig.
2f, g). This parallels previous observations in CARMA1- and BCL10-deficient cells19. Hence,
the recruitment of P-IKK and consequent alterations of IκBα are defective without CK1α.
Nonetheless, CK1α still associated with CARMA1 in PKCθ- or BCL10-silenced cells, or after
treatment with the PKC inhibitor rottlerin, although BCL10/MALT1 recruitment to CK1α/
CARMA1 and NF-κB activation were diminished (Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, CK1α
associates with CARMA1 independently of PKCθ and BCL10, and does not require PKCθdependent modifications of CARMA1.
To investigate the role of CK1α enzyme activity, we generated kinase-dead CK1α by
introducing point mutations in the ATPase domain (K46R, D136N, or D136A)20, 21. In
CK1α-silenced Jurkat, D136N-mCK1α markedly enhanced TCR-induced NF-κB, surpassing
the response in cells reconstituted with WT-CK1α (Fig. 3a). Human K46R-, D136N-, and
D136A-CK1α mutants gave similar results (Supplemental Fig. 9a). Accordingly, IκBα
phosphorylation and degradation was augmented in D136N-mCK1α expressing cells
compared to WT-mCK1α (Fig. 3b). The D136N-CK1α synergistic effect was abolished in
BCL10-silenced cells, or when D136N/D293A-mCK1α was used (Supplementary Fig. 9d, e),
suggesting that enhanced NF-κB requires BCL10, and binding to CARMA1. Thus, CK1α
kinase activity plays a negative role in TCR-induced NF-κB activation, in addition to the
positive signaling role of CK1α in the CBM complex.

By analogy with IKKβ, which marks BCL10 for degradation by phosphorylation22, we
inferred that CK1α might phosphorylate a substrate to downregulate the CBM. CARMA1,
which binds CK1α, was an attractive candidate. We observed that WT- but not D136NCK1α retarded the electrophoretic migration of CARMA1 in a λ-phosphatase-dependent
manner, suggesting that CK1α phosphorylates it (Fig. 3c, and Supplementary Fig. 10). Because
CARMA1 contains 142 potential phospho-acceptors, we used truncation mutants to identify
CK1α phosphorylation sites. In HEK293T cells, CARMA1-CCL(104-660) existed as two
species, and WT- but not D136N-CK1α shifted essentially all the CARMA1-CCL to the slow
migrating, λ-phosphatase-sensitive species (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 10a, b).
CARMA1-CCL(104-610) was the shortest CK1α-sensitive construct, as a mutant lacking
residues 601-610 was not modified (Fig. 3e). This narrowed the search to three serines, namely
S603, S607, and S608. Their substitution to alanine showed that only S608A and S603A/608A
(2SA) were insensitive to CK1α, suggesting that S608 might be the key CK1α phosphorylation
site (Fig. 3f). NF-κB enhancement was observed in CARMA1-deficient Jurkat cells11
reconstituted with 2SA- and S608A-CARMA1 (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 10c and d).
This evidence indicates that CK1α specifically phosphorylates CARMA1 at S608, which
impairs its ability to activate NF-κB.

Using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA retroviral library, we conducted a systematic screen for
essential survival genes for two molecularly and clinically distinct lymphoma types, ABC and
GCB (germinal centre B cell-like) DLBCL12,23, 24. ABC, but not GCB, DLBCL cells rely
on constitutive NF-κB activation for proliferation and survival25. Previously, this screen
identified CARMA1, BCL10, and MALT1 as critical components for ABC DLBCL cell
survival12. Additional screening uncovered two CK1α shRNAs that were selectively lethal for
ABC DLBCL cell lines (Fig. 4a). We cloned these CK1α shRNA sequences into a GFPexpressing retroviral vector12, and infected cell lines representing ABC DLBCL, GCB
DLBCL, and multiple myeloma. CK1α shRNA expression decreased the fraction of GFPpositive, shRNA-expressing cells over time in all four ABC DLBCL cell lines but not in GCB
DLBCL or multiple myeloma cell lines, confirming that CK1α knockdown is specifically lethal
to ABC DLBCL cells (Fig. 4b).

To evaluate CK1α participation in the NF-κB pathway in ABC DLBCL, the OCI-Ly3 cell line
harboring an IKK activity reporter consisting of an IκBα-luciferase fusion protein was
used12. If IKK is inactivated, there is less phosphorylation and degradation of the IκBαluciferase fusion protein and luciferase activity rises. Induction of CK1α shRNA expression
increased luciferase activity, as did shRNAs targeting IKKβ, CARMA1, MALT1, and BCL10,
whereas control shRNAs targeting the Spi-B transcription factor (SPIB) and EGFP had no
effect (Fig. 4c). Consistently, CK1α knockdown decreased NF-κB in the nuclei of OCI-Ly3
cells and reduced IκBα phosphorylation in HBL1, U2932 and OCI-Ly3 cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Thus, CK1α is required for the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway in
ABC DLBCL cells. We also detected a strong binding of CK1α to MALT1 and ubiquitinated
MALT1 in ABC DLBCL but not GCB DLBCL cell lines (Fig. 4d). Some ABC DLBCLs harbor
mutant forms of CARMA1 that constitutively activate NF-κB and generate cytoplasmic
aggregates that colocalize with MALT1 and IKK26. Such CARMA1 aggregates also contain
CK1α, further implicating CK1α in CBM complex activity in ABC DLBCL (Fig. 4e). We next
tested whether the lethality of an shRNA targeting the CK1α 3′-untranslated region could be
prevented by WT-CK1α or ΔC-CK1α, which does not bind CARMA1. WT-, but not ΔCCK1α rescued two ABC DLBCL cell lines from CK1α shRNA toxicity (Fig. 4f). In contrast,
neither WT-CK1α nor ΔC-CK1α rescued ABC DLBCL cells from CARMA1 shRNA toxicity.
Thus, direct interaction of CK1α with CARMA1 is apparently required for ABC DLBCL cell
survival.

In summary, our results have unveiled CK1α as an important bifunctional modulator of
lymphocyte adaptive immune responses. While CK1α associates with CARMA1 and
positively conveys TCR-induced NF-κB, it also phosphorylates CARMA1, thereby dampening
signaling. This provides a conceptual framework for CK1α as a signaling gate, using both
positive and negative influences to control the flow of information leading to gene induction.
The phosphorylation and inactivation of CARMA1 by CK1α is reminiscent of the GSK3β-/
CK1α cooperation to promote β-catenin destruction27, and our preliminary data indicate that
CK1α contributes to CARMA1 degradation (Supplementary Fig. 10). We also provide genetic,
biochemical and functional evidence that CK1α is an essential participant in the aberrant NFκB activity required for ABC DLBCL subtype survival. Similar to IKKβ22, the positive
function of CK1α supplants its negative role, likely because of the constitutive upstream
activation signals. Of note, CK1α was neither mutated nor amplified in ABC DLBCL cell lines
(data not shown), indicating that this CK1α dependency resembles to the “non-oncogene
addiction” phenomenon in which the cancer cell phenotype depends on specific cellular
genes28, 29. These “conditionally essential malignancy” (CEMal) genes may or may not be
oncogenes or the initiator genes for cancer, but they are essential for the propagation of a
specific transformed phenotype and therefore attractive therapeutic targets28, 29. Interestingly,
CK1α is required for the survival of ABC DLBCL cells with either mutant or WT-CARMA1,
revealing it to be a CEMal gene. However, CK1α is a complex target for chemotherapy given
its counterposing roles in signaling.

A retroviral shRNA library was constructed in the modified pRSMX plasmid containing a
doxocyline-inducible H1 promoter for shRNA expression and a random 60-mer “bar-code”
sequence. The association of each bar code with an shRNA sequence in each library plasmid
was determined by sequencing. Screening utilized engineered cells that express the bacterial
tetracycline repressor (TETR)12. 500–1000 individual shRNA plasmids were combined to
generate retroviral pools, which were used to infect TETR-expressing lymphoma and multiple
myeloma cell lines. Puromycin-selected, infected cells were induced with doxycycline for
shRNA expression in half of the culture. Three weeks after shRNA induction, bar code
sequences were amplified from the genomic DNA of induced and uninduced cells,
fluorescently labeled, and hybridized to bar code microarrays to identify shRNA vectors that
were relatively depleted from the induced population. The effective CK1α shRNA sequences
identified from the screen are: CK1α#1, 5′-GACTCTGCATTAACTCTATAA-3′ and
CK1α#2, 5′-GAGCAAGCTCTATAAGATTCT-3′.

a, NF-κB luciferase assay (mean ± s.d. of triplicate experiments) of nonspecific (NS)-and
CK1α-silenced Jurkat cells reconstituted with an empty vector (−), WT- or D136N-mouse
CK1α (mCK1α). RLU, relative luciferase units. b, IB of Jurkat cells expressing WT-, or
D136N-mCK1α stimulated with 1 μg/ml anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. c, IB of HEK293T cells
expressing Myc/Venus (M/V)-CARMA1 together with an empty vector (−), WT-, or D136NmCK1α. Filled and open triangles, CARMA1 and its shifted form; Hsp90, loading control.
d, Schematic of CARMA1 coiled-coil linker region (CARMA1-CCL, residues 104-660). Red
circles, serine/threonine residues. IB of HEK293T cells overexpressing a vector alone (−),
WT-, and D136N-CK1α with M/V-CARMA1-CCL(104-660). Open and solid arrowheads,
phosphorylated and dephosphorylated CCL. e, Experiment as in (d) using M/V-tagged CCL
residues 104-610 or 104-600. Diaphanous (mDIA1), loading control. f, Experiment as in (d)
using Myc/Cerulean (M/Cer)-tagged CCL(104-610) with the indicated serine to alanine
substitution. g, NF-κB luciferase assay (mean ± s.d. of triplicate experiments) of CARMA1-

Figure 4. Role of CK1α in activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
survival and NF-κB signaling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, A genetic screen using 1,854 shRNA vectors targeting 683 genes identified two CK1α
shRNAs that block the survival of ABC but not GCB DLBCL cell lines. Shown are the relative
fluorescent signals from bar code microarrays comparing shRNA-induced versus uninduced
cells 21 days post-shRNA induction. Data are mean ± s.d. of four independent infections of
the shRNA retroviral library. b, Survival analysis by flow cytometry of the indicated lymphoma
and multiple myeloma cell lines retrovirally infected to express CK1α shRNA and GFP. c, An
OCI-Ly3 cell line stably expressing an IκBα-luciferase reporter was retrovirally infected with
the indicated shRNAs. Shown is the percentage of luciferase activity in shRNA-induced cells
compared to uninduced cells. d, IP/IB of cell lysates from the indicated cell lines. Ub, ubiquitin.
e, Immunofluorescent staining for CARMA1 mutant 326 (HA epitope), and endogenous
CK1α in OCI-Ly19 retrovirally transduced to express HA-tagged CARMA1 mutant 3. Shown
are 2 adjacent cells with nuclei counterstained (blue). f, Indicated ABC DLBCL cells were
transduced with WT-CK1α or ΔC-CK1α (Δ283-337), and subsequently with vectors coexpressing GFP and either CK1α shRNA or CARMA1 shRNA. GFP+ cell fraction was
monitored as in (b).
