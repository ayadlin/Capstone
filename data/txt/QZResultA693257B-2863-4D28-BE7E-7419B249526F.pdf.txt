Abstract
Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA), the B subunit of the
binary anthrax toxin, binds to the cellular receptors capillary
morphogenesis gene 2 protein and tumor endothelial marker
8 with high affinity. Both receptors are expressed on endothelial cells during angiogenesis. We sought to determine
whether one could inhibit angiogenesis by interfering with the
binding of these receptors to their endogenous ligands. Here,
we show that wild-type PA inhibits both vascular endothelial
growth factor–induced and basic fibroblast growth factor–
induced angiogenesis at moderate but statistically significant
levels. Structure-activity studies identified a PA mutant that
exhibited markedly enhanced inhibition of angiogenesis and
also inhibited tumor growth in vivo. This mutant, PASSSR , is
unable to undergo normal cellular processing and, thus,
remains bound to the surface receptor. Further mutation of
PASSSR so that it does not bind to these cell surface receptors
abolished its ability to inhibit angiogenesis. We conclude that
high-affinity anthrax toxin receptor (ATR) ligands, such as PA
and PASSSR , are angiogenesis inhibitors and that ATRs are
useful targets for antiangiogenic therapy. These results also
suggest that endothelial cell-binding proteins from additional
pathogens may inhibit angiogenesis and raise the question of
the role of such inhibition in pathogenesis. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) is the 83-kDa B
subunit of anthrax toxin. Anthrax toxicity is initiated by the
binding of PA to cell surface receptors that include tumor
endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis gene 2
protein (CMG2; refs. 1, 2). Following receptor binding, PA is
proteolytically activated by a cell surface–associated furin-like
protease (3, 4). Proteolysis removes a steric barrier in PA and
prompts oligomerization to a heptameric species (5). PA oligomerization generates binding sites for the A subunits, lethal factor
(LF) and edema factor (EF), and triggers endocytosis of the
resulting complex (5). EF is a Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent
adenylate cyclase, and LF is a mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase–selective protease. Any combination of three A subunit
molecules can bind to the PA heptamer. After internalization, the
low pH environment of the endocytic compartment triggers a

conformational rearrangement in the toxin complex that allows
translocation of A subunits into the cytosol where they act on their
intracellular substrates (5). The activity of these enzymes is
currently believed to be responsible for anthrax pathogenesis.
PA binds to two known cell surface receptor proteins, known as
anthrax toxin receptor (ATR) 2 (or CMG2) and ATR1 (or TEM8;
refs. 1, 2). The ATRs form their own subfamily of von Willebrand
factor (vWF) domains, with 60% amino acid identity between them
(2), compared with <25% for other human and mouse genes. Sitedirected mutagenesis studies of PA have shown the importance of
individual amino acid residues for receptor binding and activity
(6–10). X-ray crystal structures are available for the CMG2 vWF
domain in complex with individual PA molecules (11) and PA63
heptamer (12). The cocrystals show that CMG2 shares structural
homology with other vWF domains (e.g., integrin a subunits) and
binds PA in a manner that mimics the binding of integrins to their
ligands (11, 13).
The exact biological roles of the anthrax receptors are
incompletely understood. However, their likely function involves
binding to, and signaling from, the extracellular matrix. CMG2 was
initially identified as the product of capillary morphogenesis gene 2,
a gene up-regulated in endothelial cells forming tubes in a collagen
gel (14). CMG2 is a 54-kDa transmembrane protein whose
intracellular domain has multiple signaling motifs (2, 14). CMG2
is expressed on endothelial cells in most tissues, with the exception
of the brain, as well as on other cell types, such as monocytes
(15, 16). Mutations in the protein result in juvenile hyaline
fibromatosis and infantile systemic hyalinosis, underscoring its
importance in cell-extracellular matrix interactions (16–18). CMG2
has been shown to bind specifically to extracellular matrix
molecules in vitro, including collagen IV and fibronectin, suggesting
that these may be natural ligands of the protein (14). The NH2terminal vWF domain of CMG2 binds to PA in a divalent cationdependent manner with an affinity as high as 170 pmol/L (19). This
domain is highly conserved, with 94% amino acid identity between
mouse and human, increasing to 96% in PA-binding residues.
PA also binds to TEM8 (ATR1) in a divalent cation-dependent
manner with high affinity (100 nmol/L). TEM8 was originally
identified as a protein expressed on colon tumor endothelium but
not on normal endothelial cells (20). It has since been shown to be
expressed on fetal endothelial cells as well as angiogenic tumor
endothelium (21). Overexpression of the protein and blocking of
collagen-binding sites affect endothelial cell migration but not tube
formation or proliferation (22), whereas knockdown of the gene
with hammerhead ribozymes inhibits both cell migration and tube
formation (23). These data suggest that TEM8, like CMG2, may be
involved in vascular growth. Like CMG2, TEM8 is a transmembrane
protein with an NH2-terminal vWF domain. It is also highly
conserved, with 99% amino acid identity between mouse and

human, increasing to 100% in PA-binding residues. However, the
specificity of TEM8 may be somewhat different than CMG2
because TEM8 has been shown to interact with collagen VI and
collagen I (22).
It is unlikely that there are additional receptors with high
affinity for anthrax toxin. The closest family members in the
human or mouse genome are integrins, which only share 25%
identity with ATRs in the PA-binding domain. It is thus unlikely
that these proteins bind PA. In addition, following exhaustive
mutagenesis studies, the Young lab firmly established TEM8
(ATR1) and CMG2 (ATR2) as the receptors for anthrax toxin (1, 2);
no new PA-binding receptors have been identified since 2003.
However, there have been reports of accessory proteins in anthrax
intoxication (24, 25).
Binding and expression data for CMG2 and TEM8 indicate that
these receptors are expressed on the endothelium during
angiogenesis or related processes in vitro and in vivo, can bind
to components of the extracellular matrix important in angiogenesis, and can affect the behavior of endothelial cells in a manner
reminiscent of known targets of antiangiogenic therapy. We sought,
therefore, to determine whether binding of these proteins to their
endogenous ligands might be required for normal angiogenesis. If
so, competing high-affinity ligands (such as PA) could interfere
with angiogenesis. We used the corneal micropocket assay to
ascertain in vivo whether PA binding to these proteins inhibits
angiogenesis, presumably by competition with natural ligands.

Materials and Methods
Protein production. PA and PA mutants were produced recombinantly
in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Star using the pET22b expression system.
Cultures were grown to an A600 of 3 to 10 in a 5-L fermentor at 37jC using
ECPM1 growth medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 mg/L; ref. 19).
The culture was induced with isopropyl-L-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside
(0.8–1 mmol/L) for 3 to 4 h at 27jC to 30jC and cells grew to a final
A600 of 6 to 20. Periplasmic lysates were generated as described previously
(26). The lysate was buffered with 20 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 8.5) and purified
by Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare) eluted by
a 0!250 mmol/L NaCl gradient using buffers A [20 mmol/L Tris-Cl,
1 mmol/L CaCl2 (pH 8.5)] and B (A + 1 mol/L NaCl). Pure fractions (as

determined by SDS-PAGE) were concentrated and then purified by SEC
(Sephacryl 200) using buffer C (A + 150 mmol/L NaCl). Pure fractions
following SEC (as determined by SDS-PAGE) were concentrated and stored
at 80jC. Final protein concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry (e 280 of 75,670 mol/L1 cm1).
Mouse corneal micropocket assay. The corneal micropocket assay was
done as described (27) using pellets containing 80 ng of basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF) or 160 ng of human carrier-free recombinant vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; R&D Systems) in C57BL/6J mice. The
treated groups received daily or twice daily i.p injections for 5 (bFGF) or 6
(VEGF) consecutive days of protein in PBS. Treatment was started on the
day of pellet implantation; control mice received only vehicle i.p. The area of
vascular response was assessed on the 5th (bFGF) or 6th (VEGF)
postoperative day using a slit lamp. Typically, 10 eyes per group were
measured.
Proliferation assay. Human microvascular endothelial cells (Cambrex)
were maintained in EGM-2 (Cambrex) according to the vendor’s
instructions and used before passage 7. BCE cells (a kind gift of Dr. Judah
Folkman, Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) were
maintained on DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 ng/
mL bFGF. On day 0, proliferating cultures of BCE or HMVEC-d cells were
seeded at f10% confluence into 96-well plates. After attachment, medium
was exchanged for medium containing 1 pmol/L to 1 Amol/L of the
indicated protein. Cells were allowed to grow for 7 days and then quantified
using CyQUANT (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s directions. The
degree of proliferation in culture was measured by comparing wells in each
plate fixed in absolute ethanol on day 0 with experimental wells, with fold
proliferation calculated by dividing CyQUANT fluorescence in experimental
wells by that in day 0 wells. Groups were compared using Student’s t test,
with Bonferroni correction where appropriate.
Migration assay. Human microvascular endothelial cells were maintained as above. Polycarbonate Transwell inserts, 6.5 mm diameter with
8.0 Am pores, were coated with fibronectin (BD Biosciences) and type I rat
tail collagen (Upstate) or left uncoated. Cells were harvested and
resuspended in EBM (Cambrex) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin
(Fisher Chemical). Cells (10,000 per well) were plated onto wells containing
medium alone or medium containing the molecule to be tested. These wells
were suspended above wells containing 5 to 10 ng/mL recombinant human
VEGF (R&D Systems). Cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h. Membranes
were rinsed once in PBS and then fixed and processed using Diff-Quick
(Dade Diagnostics). Cells on the top of the membrane were removed using
cotton-tipped applicators, and the membrane was removed from the insert
using a scalpel. Membranes were then mounted on slides, and the number

containing approximately equal tumor volume, and the group with slightly
larger aggregate tumor size was selected for treatment. Daily i.p. drug
injections were done with protein in PBS. Serial caliper measurements of
perpendicular diameters were used to calculate tumor volume using the
following formula: (shortest diameter)2  (longest diameter)  0.52.
Animals were sacrificed after 2 weeks of treatment. All animal studies
were conducted according to protocols approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of Children’s Hospital. Animals were anesthetized by isoflurane
inhalation before all procedures and observed daily for signs of toxicity.
Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation.

Results
As described above, both CMG2 and TEM8 are expressed on
endothelial cells during angiogenesis. We sought to determine
whether PA could inhibit angiogenesis by interfering with the
binding of these receptors to their endogenous ligands. The ability
of PA and PA mutants to inhibit angiogenesis was evaluated using
the standard mouse corneal neovascularization assay developed by
our laboratory (27). The corneas of C57BL/6J mice were implanted
with slow-release pellets containing 160 ng VEGF. Mice were then
treated with 10 mg/kg PA i.p. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment with
wild-type (wt) PA resulted in a small, but statistically significant,
decrease in vessel area of f15%.
To establish whether receptor binding was responsible for the
observed effect, several PA mutant proteins were also tested. If PA

of cells in a microscopic field was counted either manually or with
computer assistance using Scion Image. BCE assays were done similarly,
except that membranes were preincubated with complete medium to
improve cell adherence, and migration was toward complete medium.
Tube formation assay. Human microvascular endothelial cells were
maintained as above. Before the assay, a 1- to 2-mm layer of Matrigel was
plated into the wells of a 12-well cluster. Approximately 105 cells were
plated on this layer in EGM-2. Plates were examined at 12, 14, 16, 18, and
24 h for differences in network formation. In each experiment, good
network formation was observed in untreated control wells.
Tumor models. To determine the in vivo antitumor activity of PASSSR,
C57BL/6J male mice (8–10 weeks old; The Jackson Laboratory) were
inoculated s.c. with f3  106 mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cells. The
murine Lewis lung tumor line was maintained by in vivo passages as
described (28). Treatment was started after the development of measurable
tumor (tumors f0.1 cm3). Animals were sorted into groups of five

Anthrax PA Inhibits Angiogenesis

Figure 4. The effect of PASSSR on Lewis lung tumor growth. The volume
(with 95% confidence interval indicated by error bars ) of tumors treated with
PASSSR (5) was significantly smaller than untreated controls (y) on days 12 and
14 (P < 0.01, Student’s t test).

binding to the anthrax receptor(s) was responsible for the observed
antiangiogenic effect, then increasing the time that PA spent bound
to the receptor could be expected to increase the effect. When PA
binds to its receptor, it is cleaved, rapidly multimerizes, and is
internalized, thus removing it from the cell surface. In an effort to
increase the time PA is bound to the cell surface receptors, we
tested the ability of various PA mutants to inhibit angiogenesis.
PASSSR (R164S, K165S, K166S, and R167R) is a PA mutant that
is resistant to cleavage by endogenous furin-like proteases (3).
Because the absence of a furin cleavage site on PASSSR interferes
with normal cellular processing and internalization of the PAreceptor complex, this PA mutant is presumed to have a longer
extracellular lifetime and receptor residency than wt PA. As shown
in Fig. 1B, PASSSR was significantly more active than wt PA at
inhibiting angiogenesis (P < 0.05; Fig. 1B). Mutants PAD512K and
PAD512K, K199E, R468A, R470D fail to multimerize in solution (9) but
have unknown oligomerization capacity at the cell surface. Neither
of these mutants showed an appreciable increase in angiogenesis
inhibition, suggesting that the in vitro oligomerization defect may
not be replicated in vivo (data not shown).
Using the most effective mutant that we had identified, we found
that treatment with PASSSR inhibited both VEGF- and bFGFinduced angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal
inhibition of f60% (Fig. 2). To test whether the difference in
efficacy between wt PA and PASSSR could also be ascribed to
differences in the circulating half-life of the two compounds rather
than receptor binding, we determined whether the effect of PASSSR
could be increased by increasing the frequency of dosing. However,
we observed no difference between daily and twice daily injections
(Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the IC50 for PASSSR is 10 to
20 mg/kg and that the maximum inhibition likely to be obtained
by daily dosing is about 60% to 70%. These data also support the
idea that receptor binding may be the cause of the observed
inhibition of angiogenesis.
To further support ATR binding as the mechanism responsible
for the observed effect, PA mutations known to interfere with
receptor binding (13, 29) were overlaid onto the PASSSR background. Significantly, a PASSSR mutant that lacks the ability to bind
to either of the ATRs (PASSSR, N682A, D683A) was unable to inhibit

corneal angiogenesis (Fig. 3A). In addition, the PASSSR, D683N
mutant, which lacks the ability to bind to TEM8 and binds to
CMG2 with 30-fold reduced affinity, failed to inhibit corneal
angiogenesis in a statistically significant manner (Fig. 3B).
Together, these data are strong demonstrations that PA interaction
with the receptor is required for antiangiogenic activity in vivo.
Antiangiogenic molecules are expected to also inhibit tumor
growth. To test the antitumor effects of PASSSR , we treated Lewis
lung carcinoma tumors with daily doses of 10 mg/kg PASSSR.
Beginning at f1 week of treatment and extending to the end of the
treatment experiment, we observed that tumor growth was
inhibited. Final tumor size in the treated group was f60% that
of the control tumors, a highly statistically significant difference
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 4).
Several mechanisms might explain the antiangiogenic and
antitumor effects of PA. Endothelial cell killing, inhibition of
endothelial cell proliferation, and inhibition of other endothelial
cell function have all been shown to inhibit vascularization. To
assess these possibilities, we tested the effects of PASSSR and

mutants on endothelial cells in vitro. PASSSR in concentrations from
1 pmol/L to 1 Amol/L had no observable effect on tube formation
on Matrigel (data not shown). BCE and HMVEC-d proliferation
were measured in the presence of concentrations from 1 pmol/L
to 1 Amol/L of PASSSR (Fig. 5A). No effect on endothelial cell proliferation was observed, although real-time reverse transcriptionPCR shows that both CMG2 and TEM8 are expressed by these cells
(data not shown). This shows that PASSSR has no direct ability to
inhibit endothelial cell proliferation or to kill endothelial cells.
PASSSR was, however, able to inhibit endothelial cell migration.
VEGF-induced migration on fibronectin-coated Transwell inserts
was inhibited by 0.2 and 2 nmol/L of PASSSR (1 and 10 the
PASSSR-CMG2 dissociation constant) in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 5B). To further test the hypothesis that PA-CMG2 interactions
are required for inhibition, we also tested the ability of PASSSR, D683N
to inhibit VEGF-induced migration. We used a 30-fold higher
concentration of PASSSR, D683N to compensate for the 30-fold
decreased affinity of this mutant for CMG2. In this experiment,
6 nmol/L PASSSR, D683N inhibited migration to the same extent as
0.2 nm PASSSR (Fig. 5B). Thus, the inhibition of migration in vivo
parallels in vitro binding, further showing that PA-CMG2 binding
inhibits endothelial cell migration. Interestingly, at very high PASSSR
concentrations (>60 nmol/L), inhibition is seen with endothelial
cells migrating to serum on uncoated Transwell inserts but not
with cells migrating to VEGF on fibronectin-coated Transwells
(data not shown). Together, these data suggest that PA inhibits
angiogenesis by impeding the ATR-mediated, growth factor–
dependent, migration of endothelial cells, thus preventing the
formation of new blood vessels.

Discussion
Data presented here implicate ATRs in angiogenic processes.
Treatment with PASSSR , which binds these receptors, results in
significant inhibition of angiogenesis. Receptor binding is required
for this antiangiogenic effect because PA mutants that do not bind
receptor also do not show the antiangiogenic effects (Fig. 3A), and
the in vivo antiangiogenic effect correlates with in vitro binding
affinity (Fig. 5B). Although the exact biological function of ATRs is
not firmly established, their likely endogenous function is binding
to and signaling from the extracellular matrix. Consequently, we
expect that the antiangiogenic effect of PA is mediated by blocking
the ability of the receptor(s) to bind extracellular matrix. Blockade
of endothelial extracellular matrix receptors can inhibit angiogenesis. For example, fragments of several extracellular matrix
proteins, such as collagens, fibronectin, and perlecan, form
angiogenesis inhibitors, such as arresten, canstatin, tumstatin,
endostatin, endorepellin, restin, and vastatin (30). In many cases,
these fragments seem to act by blocking normal function of
integrins. For example, canstatin works through avh3 integrin,
endostatin works though a5h1 integrin, and endorepellin works

through a2h1 integrin. These results are the first demonstration
that inhibition of nonintegrin extracellular matrix receptors can
also inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. This suggests the possibility that
combinations of these inhibitors with other inhibitors of endothelial cell-extracellular matrix interactions might be expected to more
successfully inhibit angiogenesis than a single target approach
because a broader spectrum of cell-matrix interactions could be
blocked. Indeed, once a critical threshold of extracellular matrix
receptors is blocked, one might speculate that endothelial cell
motility and thus angiogenesis will be halted.
Our studies establish that binding of PA to its receptors
interferes with angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that
intact anthrax lethal toxin (PA + LF) has antivascular activity
(31, 32) through the LF-mediated killing of endothelial cells, similar
to many other vascular killing agents (33). In these previous
reports, the observed antivascular effect is due to delivery of LF to
the cell via receptor-mediated internalization. However, in this
work, we show that blockade of the ATR(s) themselves inhibits
angiogenesis in vivo without any requirement for endothelial cell
killing. Thus, inhibition of endothelial migration can be obtained
without the requirement receptor-mediated toxin internalization
and endothelial cell killing. Moreover, because administration of
PA alone avoids cell toxicity associated with the presence of LF, we
were able to use much higher doses of PA (f1,000-fold) than were
used in previous studies involving the complete anthrax lethal
toxin (31, 32).
In addition to anthrax PA, proteins from other pathogens bind
endothelial cell receptors. It will be interesting to ascertain whether
some of these also have antiangiogenic effects. Strikingly, whereas
nonpathogenic hantaviruses bind to h1 integrins, pathogenic
hantaviruses [whose pathology is similar to that of anthrax (34)]
bind to h3 integrins found on endothelial cells. As is true of anthrax
PA, these viruses can inhibit endothelial cell migration (35), suggesting that they may also have the capacity to inhibit angiogenesis.
This notion is supported by the observation that these integrins
are also the targets of several antiangiogenic agents, including
canstatin and tumstatin (30). Thus, endothelial cell-binding
proteins from multiple pathogens may inhibit angiogenesis.
In conclusion, we have shown that an antiangiogenic effect can
be obtained with PA and PA mutants. Maintaining PA bound to the
extracellular surface receptor, through mutations that inhibit
internalization, markedly enhances the antiangiogenic and antitumor effects. We are currently pursuing the design of small
molecule and peptide mimetics for preclinical development.
