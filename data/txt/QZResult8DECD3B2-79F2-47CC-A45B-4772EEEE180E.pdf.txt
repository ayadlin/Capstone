BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of radioimmunotherapy with intensitymodulated radiation (IMRT) and cetuximab in stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: NEAR was a
prospective, monocentric phase II trial including patients unfit for chemoradiation regimen; treatment consisted
of IMRT and weekly cetuximab followed by a 13-week maintenance period. Primary endpoints were toxicity and feasibility; secondary endpoints were remission rates at completion of the planned treatment according to Response
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor (RECIST), local/distant progression-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS:
Thirty patients (median age, 71 years) were treated within the protocol. Overall response rate was 63% (partial
remission: 19 of 30) patients. Median locoregional, distant, overall progression-free survival was 20.5, 10.9, and
8.5 months. Median overall survival was 19.5 months, with an estimated 1- and 2-year survival of 66.7% and 34.9%
respectively. Stage (IIIA vs IIIB) and histologic subtype did not have a significant impact on survival rates in our
patients. Treatment was tolerated well with only mild toxicity ( 3 pneumonitis: 3.3%, any  3 acute toxicity: 36.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Combined radioimmunotherapy with cetuximab was safe and feasible, especially in elderly patients

KEYWORDS: IMRT, NSCLC, cetuximab, radioimmunotherapy, elderly.

Only 25% of all newly diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are resectable. However, treatment of stage III
remains a challenge. Over the years, combined treatment regimen of platin-containing chemotherapy and radiation have
been established as the standard of care.1-4 While the addition of chemotherapy to radiation alone was shown to improve
both local control and survival,5 it has also become clear that concomitant radiochemotherapy protocols are preferable to
sequential regimen if permitted by the patients’ condition.1-3 Also, dose escalation in radiation treatment was shown to
improve local control and overall survival very early on.6-9 Hence optimal treatment for stage III NSCLC would consist
of dose escalated platin-containing chemoradiation. Unfortunately, intensified treatment regimens come at the cost
of increased treatment-related side effects. Chemotherapy mainly increases hematotoxicity1,3 and incidence of esophagitis,1,10 while conventional dose escalation goes along with increased pulmonary toxicity and pneumonitis rates. Patients
unfit to undergo surgical interventions due to comorbidities are very often unfit to undergo the combined modality
approach. In clinical routine, very often compromises with chemotherapy dose and substances as well as limitation of
radiotherapy doses due to poor pulmonary function are necessary due to the high rate of severe comorbidities inherent
with NSCLC (ie, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], cardiovascular disease). Elderly and multimorbid
patients hence often receive radiotherapy (RT) only to avoid serious treatment-related side-effects.

IMRT and Cetuximab for NSCLC: NEAR/Münter et al

Therefore, treatment of NSCLC in the elderly and
multimorbid patient remains a serious therapeutic challenge. Within the past years though, targeted therapies
have found their way radio-oncologic treatment regimen,
the most well known probably being cetuximab. Cetuximab is a monoclonal epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) antibody and has been shown to be effective in
the definitive treatment of squamous cell head and neck
cancer (SCCHN) in a large randomized phase III trial
comparing radioimmunotherapy with cetuximab and
radiotherapy only. Cetuximab was shown to improve
both local control and overall survival in the combinedmodality treatment group at the cost of only modest treatment-related side effects.11,12 Preclinical data also show a
similar efficiency of cetuximab and radiation as compared
to cisplatin and radiation in nonsmall cell cancer cell
lines,13 hence providing a rationale for the exploration of
the less toxic systemic agent in the combined radiation
treatment of NSCLC. While systemic treatment has
evolved toward more targeted and tailored approaches,
radiation treatment has also made progress by the routine
establishment of sophisticated planning and treatment
techniques. While the NSCLC chemoradiotherapy landmark trials were generally still using two-dimensional
(2D) RT techniques, technologic advances now allow
higher dose conformality and application of steeper dose
gradients using intensity-modulated radiation treatment
(IMRT), thereby permitting dose escalation while relatively sparing surrounding normal tissues.14-17 The use of
4D computed tomography (CT) to visualize target
motion and positron emission tomography (PET) -based
radiotherapy planning to limit radiation fields where
possible18,19,20 also promises reduction of treatment
toxicity.
The NEAR trial was designed to evaluate treatment
toxicity and efficacy of IMRT based on 4D CT and 18
FGD-PET in combination with cetuximab weekly and
cetuximab maintenance in patients unfit or unwilling to
undergo combined radiochemotherapy.

METHODS
Patients
Eligible patients had histologically proven NSCLC stage
III where patients were either unfit to undergo combined
chemoradiotherapy or had refused the standard treatment. EGFR status evaluation was encouraged but not
compulsory. Patients needed to have sufficient lung function (FeV1 1.51 or 40% of the individual norm

value), Karnofsky performance status of 70%, and
adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.
Patients were not included in the trial if loosing &ge:5%
of their original body weight within the past 6 months or
had either active hemoptysis, active infections, superior
vena cava syndrome, malignant pleural effusions, or prior
malignant disease within the past 5 years.
Work-up included thoracic and cerebral diagnostic
CT scans, abdominal ultrasound, bone scan (including
subsequent x-ray examinations of any suspect area).
The trial was reviewed and approved by the University of Heidelberg Medical School Ethics Committee;
informed consent was obtained from all patients before
inclusion.
Immunotherapy
Patients received the loading dose cetuximab 1 week
before RT (d1) at the recommended dose of 400 mg/m2
body surface followed by weekly infusions with 250 mg/
m2. After completion of combined radioimmunotherapy
(typically loading dose cetuximab and 7 weekly applications), patients receive 13 applications (total: loading dose
plus 20 weekly cycles) of cetuximab maintenance. All
patients received 8 mg dexamethasone and 4 mg dimetinden before each application of cetuximab. Missed out
doses of cetuximab during the treatment course were
omitted. Cetuximab-induced skin reactions were treated
according to standard in-house protocols with topic or
systemic antibiotics as indicated.
RT
All patients received an 18-FDG-PET-scan for target definition, but were excluded from the trial at diagnosis of distant metastases in the PET scan. For radiotherapy
planning, the PET scan was used to identify potentially
involved lymph nodes and consequently include these
within the PTV1.
RT planning was based on a 3 mm 4D-CT scan in a
vacuum mattress including arm-rest and scotch cast mask.
Target delineation was carried out on a standard, freebreathing CT scanner. However, various inspiration
and expiration phases (100%, 80%, 70%, 50%, 25% at
inspiration and expiration) were stereotactically correlated
in our treatment planning system to provide information
on tumor breathing motion. PTV1 and PTV2 were
outlined so as to encompass the visible tumor with an
adequate safety margin in all breathing phases.
All patients were treated with fractionated, inversely
planned IMRT either at a 6 MV linear accelerator in step-

and-shoot technique or at a 6 MV tomotherapy unit
under at least weekly image guidance using either inroom CT (Siemens Primatom for linac-based step-andshoot technique) or MV cone-beam CT for tomotherapy.
Final dose calculation was based on a superposition
(step-and-shoot IMRT) or collapsed-cone (tomotherapy)
algorithm.
Elective lymph node irradiation plus primary and
PET-positive nodes (PTV2) was carried out to 50 Gray
(Gy) at 2 Gy/ fraction. Patients subsequently received a
boost to the primary and PET-positive lymph nodes
(PTV1) of 16 Gy at 2 Gy/ fraction (total dose 66 Gy). We
aimed to keep the V20 below 35% and the mean lung
dose (MLD) below 15 to 17 Gy. If dose to normal lung
was deemed too high with this concept, elective lymph
node irradiation (PTV2) was carried out to 40 Gy at
2 Gy/ fraction with a subsequent boost (PTV1) of 26 Gy
also at 2 Gy/ fraction (total dose).
Follow-up
At completion of the treatment (: ¼ completion of cetuximab maintenance), patients received an 18-FDG-PET
scan and thoracic CT scan to evaluate response. A repeat
lung function test was also carried out at the same time.
To exclude disease progression under therapy, patients
also received a chest CT at completion of radiation
treatment. Regular follow-up is carried out in 3-month
intervals incl. chest CT, abdominal ultrasound, or CT
q6months, bone-scan every 12 months until completion
of trial participation.
Study Design and Analysis
The NEAR trial is a prospective, monocentric phase II
feasibility trial of combined radioimmunotherapy with
weekly cetuximab (7 applications) and IMRT and cetuximab maintenance (13 applications).
Primary endpoint of the trial was toxicity and feasibility of the combination treatment. Secondary endpoints
were remission rates at completion of the planned treatment, local/distant progression-free survival, and overall
survival.
Evaluation of disease response was carried out
according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
Tumor (RECIST).21 Local, distant, overall progressionfree survival, as well as overall survival were calculated
from cetuximab loading dose and estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier nonparametric estimation method.22
Statistical analysis including Kaplan-Meier survival estimation, univariate analysis, and log-rank/Wilcoxon tests

2988

for significance were carried out using the commercial
software package xlstat 2010.

RESULTS
Between May of 2005 and March of 2009, 49 patients
were accrued to the NEAR trial, 19 patients subsequently
had to be excluded due to diagnosis of distant metastases
on PET scan (18 of 19 patients) and cerebral MRI (1 of
19 patients) and did not undergo combined radioimmunotherapy. Thirty patients with a median age of 71 years
(57-82) started treatment within the protocol,23 baseline
characteristics are displayed in Table 1. Most patients
were diagnosed with higher tumor stages, all but 1 patient
had positive lymph nodes. More patients had a squamous
cell carcinoma (17 of 30 patients) than adenocarcinoma
(10 of 30 patients). All of the patients included had 1 or
more severe comorbidities (Table 1), the most common
being COPD and coronary heart disease, precluding
them from receiving combined radiochemotherapy. Only
1 patient did refuse chemoradiation. Median follow-up to
date is 19 months (range, 2-50 months).
Patients received a median of 20 cycles (range, 2-20
cycles) of cetuximab, 3 patients did not complete protocol
treatment due to intercurrent disease. These patients were
also not assessable for response evaluation at completion
of treatment but were included in the survival analysis. All
patients received radiation treatment as intensity-modulated RT. Twenty-five of 30 patients received the protocol-specified dosage of 50 Gy to PTV2 and 66 Gy to
PTV1. For 5 of 30 patients, treatment had to be modified
due to otherwise unacceptable radiation doses to the lung,
these patients were given 40 Gy to the PTV2 and 66 Gy
to PTV1. Median volume for PTV1 was 254 mL (range,
46-529 mL) and 759 mL (range, 384-1531 mL) for
PTV2. PTV2 included the supraclavicular lymphatics in
6 patients. Treatment characteristics and dose–volume
parameters are displayed in Tables 2 and 3. The median
V20 in this patient cohort was 26% (range, 15%-60%),
while the median MLD was 15 Gy (range, 3-21 Gy).
Twenty-seven of 30 patients were available for assessment
of radiologic response, 19 of 30 patients showed partial
remissions, 6 patients stable disease, and 2 patients progressive disease due to development of pulmonary metastases. Two of the 3 patients that did not undergo formal
restaging were also shown to have partial remissions on
their most recent CT scan. PET-scans for evaluation
of metabolic response were available for 26 of the 30
treated patients demonstrating a median reduction in

with a metabolic complete response in 6 cases. Twenty-six
of 30 patients also underwent postherapeutic lung function tests showing a median improvement in FeV1 of

46.9% (95% CI, 26.9-66.9%) (Fig. 1b); hence, KaplanMeier analysis yielded a median overall progression-free
survival of 8.5 months (95% CI, 7.2-10.4 months) and a
1a- progression-free survival of 27.8% (Fig. 1c). Overall
survival in the NEAR patients was estimated with a
median of 19.6 months (95% CI, 11.5-24.7 months) and
a 1- and 2-year overall survival of 66.7% and 34.9%,
respectively (Fig. 1d).
Overall survival of stage IIIB patients was not statistically different from IIIA patients (Fig. 2). No statistically
significant difference between stage IIIA and IIIB was
found for locoregional, distant, and overall progressionfree survival. Analysis of survival yielded noticeable
differences for locoregional and distant progression-free
survival between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma; however, this difference only reached statistical
significance in favor of squamous cell carcinoma for distant progression-free survival (P ¼ 0.028). Overall progression-free survival and overall survival (Fig. 3) did not
exhibit a significant dependence on histology in our data.
Treatment was generally tolerated well. There were
no allergic reactions to treatment with cetuximab, dose
reductions were not necessary in any of the patients. Six
patients developed asymptomatic radiologic pulmonary
changes indicative of pneumonitis (Common Toxicity

symptomatic pneumonitis (CTC III: 3.3%). 11 cases of
CTC III toxicity were observed for this treatment, the
most common being pneumonia (3/11 cases), 1 patient
developed a CTC IV toxicity (malignant pericardial effusion), and 3 patients CTC V toxicities (myocardial
infarction: 1 patient, fulminant sepsis with subsequent
bacterial endocarditis: 1 patient, and pulmonary embolism following DVT: 1 patient). All of the grade  V toxicities were unlikely related to the treatment (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Almost 40% (19/49 patients) were excluded from trial
participation due to diagnosis of distant metastases in the
FDG-PET scan further underlining the need for more
thorough staging by sometimes expensive diagnostic
methods24 to select adequate treatments in clinical routine. With an overall response rate of 63%, the NEAR
protocol reaches response levels of standard radiochemotherapy trials: larger trials have reported response rates in
chemotherapy-enhanced regimens between 46.4% and
84% in the combined-modality arm3,10,25 and 66.4% in
the sequential3 versus 38.9% in the RT only arm.10
Median overall survival in this trial was 19.6
months, which is higher than in intensified radiotherapy
schedules (median overall survival 12 months8), sequential radiochemotherapy with an overall survival of 13.8
months5 or even radiochemotherapy schedules with a
median overall survival of 17 months2 and 15 months.1
As reported by Albain et al1 but contrary to the results of
Hallqvist et al,26 overall survival in stage IIIa and IIIb was
not significantly different in our cohort. Survival data

ever this did not reach statistical significance. None of the
chemoradiotherapy or RT-only landmark trials have
reported outcome with respect to histologic subtypes, in
the age of tailored and targeted therapies, it is definitely
time to explore this aspect in greater depth.
Local control though is still disappointing despite
the application of high-normal RT doses to the PETpositive areas but still in keeping with current literature27 reporting a local control rate of 82% at 1 year
and 52% at 2 years in N0-staged patients treated with a
median total radiation dose of 84 Gy. Albeit elective
lymph node irradiation in NSCLC is a matter of debate

and has been challenged lately due to the low isolated
regional relapse rates,27,28 our results with a locoregional
progression-free survival of 57.6% at 1 year (median
locoregional progression-free survival, 20.5 months) are
still comparable, despite the fact that the vast majority
of our patients had lymph node metastases. However,
with 6 of 30 patients (20%) receiving elective lymph
node irradiation to the supraclavicular lymph nodes,
there might be some room for volume reduction and
subsequent dose escalation.
Distant control remains a problem in stage III disease
in all reported results so far therefore providing the clinical
rationale for maintenance therapy with cetuximab in our
trial. Median distant progression-free survival and overall
progression-free survival in our trial was only 10.9 months
and 8.5 months, respectively, and between 7 and 11.5
(overall progression-free survival) in combined-modality
chemoradiotherapy trials.10,25 Hence, still further intensification of the systemic component might be warranted. Preliminary results of initial trials combining induction
chemotherapy and combined radioimmunotherapy are
reported26,29 yielding comparable results to the NEAR
trial26 and further trials, among them studies initiated by
the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), Cancer
and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) groups are currently active.
Treatment-related toxicity in our trial has been
expectedly mild. Despite the comparatively high maximum doses to the esophagus, we have found only 1 case
of CTC 3 esophagitis (3.3%). Various other trials have
reported  3/4 esophagitis rates of up to 28%.10,30 It needs
to be mentioned though that these trials generally applied
2D or 3D techniques while we have specifically excluded
the esophagus from the PTV2 and optimized our IMRT
treatment allowing only small volumes to receive higher

2992

doses. In view of the comparatively large target volumes
(PTV1 and PTV2) and high V20 (26%) / V5 (65%) in
our trial, rates of pneumonitis were also very low with
only 1 case of CTC  3 lung toxicity as compared to 8% to
11% even in modern IMRT techniques16,17,31 in patients
with a median smaller gross tumor volume as compared
to our median PTV1 of 254 mL. While the V20 did even
reach 60% in 1 patient, one has to bear in mind that our
treatment volumes were also up to approximately 1.5
liters. In these patients, there was very little healthy lung
parenchyma left, which did receive higher doses as a consequence. This fact is reflected by the high V20. In these
cases though, the contralateral lung was spared even more
rigorously as seen from the contralateral V20. In view of
our extensive tumor and treatment volumes, IMRT—not
currently the standard RT technique in lung cancer—was
used to actually apply planned doses of 66 Gy to these
patients by reducing the V20 as compared to standard 3D
techniques.
However, 3 patients died before completion of therapy regimen. As explained before, the cause of death was
due to infection, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary
embolism based on deep venous thrombosis. While we
cannot completely rule out these incidents as potential
adverse events of our treatment, which we did not attribute
them to radioimmunotherapy for the following reasons:
the patients already had a history of heart disease (either
coronary heart disease or cardiac insufficiency) excluding
them from receiving radiochemotherapy. These factors
were also predisposing them for embolic disorders. We do
think this favorable toxicity profile is feasible especially for
elderly patients with serious comorbidities like the patients
included in the NEAR trial. These patients were unfit to
undergo either sequential or concurrent radiochemotherapy due to expected treatment-related toxicities.
Albeit treatment outcomes in elderly patients are
similar to younger ones, toxicity rates are often higher.3234
Commonly, elderly patients with NSCLC have a history of many years of smoking, therefore, presenting longterm smoking sequelae hampering comparisons between
young and old patients. These elderly patients and especially elderly patients with multiple comorbidities are
definitely under-represented in clinical trials with age
limits of approximately 70 years. Therefore, therapeutic
outcome in a less favorable clinical group being nonetheless very common in routine clinical practice is not well
defined. Recursive partitioning analyses and subanalyses
of RTOG and CALGB trials could identify negative prognostic groups, strong predictors being age and

performance status35 as well as comorbidities.36 These
factors not only are often exclusion criteria for clinical trials but also understandably affecting patient selection for
off-trial combined-modality regimens.37
Usually patients with reduced pulmonary function
due to COPD and cardiac comorbidities and large tumors
not ideal candidates for a combined radiochemotherapy
approach and will often receive routine RT only. Hence
the NEAR patient cohort does present a negative selection. The comparatively favorable results despite negative
selection may be due to the fact that all patients received a
PET scan for RT planning, patients with undiscovered
distant metastases were excluded from participation in the
trial actually selecting the ‘‘true’’ stage III patients and
excluding stage IV with a higher certainty.24
Cetuximab has shown promising results in combined radioimmunotherapy in NSCLC. Despite a comparatively negative patient selection, survival and control
rates compare favorably with preexisting data. Toxicity
was generally mild therefore encouraging this combination especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities who would otherwise be unfit for concurrent or
sequential chemoradiotherapy regimen and would therefore receive single-modality radiotherapy only. Combination of radiotherapy and cetuximab also presents a way of
applying an anticancer agent at systemically active dose
thereby providing the rationale for potentially increasing
distant control by the addition of cetuximab maintenance
to radiotherapy. Recently, the FLEX trial38 evaluating
chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy plus cetuximab in stage
IIIB and IV NSCLC, was able to demonstrate not only
improved response rates but also increased overall survival
in the combination arm independent of tumor histology.
Local and distant control rates both in standard chemoradiation as well as in our trial are still in need of improvement. Although the use of IMRT, which is not yet
standard in this disease, did already contribute significantly to maintaining intended radiation doses, even further dose escalation to the primary/ involved nodes might
be feasible if elective lymph node irradiation is not carried
out. Therefore a more intense staging including PET
imaging is definitely necessary to select patients who may
benefit from a more aggressive radiation regimen.
Distant control rates may be improved by intensification of systemic treatment components, which is
explored in several active trials (results pending). With the
advent of more patient-tailored and targeted approaches,
histologic subtype and molecular mechanisms need to be
considered in the future. Further analysis regarding

EGFR and k-ras mutation status in our patients in view of
outcome is currently in progress.

CONCLUSION
Control and survival rates in a negative prognostic patient
cohort treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy
and cetuximab are encouraging. Combination treatment is tolerated well with only mild accompanying toxicity. However, further trials are needed to address
influence of histologic subtype and more intense treatment regimen with regard to radiotherapy and addition of
chemotherapy.
