Abstract

Author Manuscript

The role of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in metastasis is a longstanding source of
controversy, largely due to an inability to monitor transient and reversible EMT phenotypes in
vivo. We established an EMT lineage tracing system to monitor this process, using a
mesenchymal-specific Cre-mediated fluorescent marker switch system in spontaneous breast-to-

lung metastasis models. We confirmed that within a predominantly epithelial primary tumor, a
small portion of tumor cells undergo EMT. Strikingly, lung metastases mainly consisted of nonEMT tumor cells maintaining their epithelial phenotype. Inhibiting EMT by overexpressing
miR-200 did not impact lung metastasis development. However, EMT cells significantly
contribute to recurrent lung metastasis formation after chemotherapy. These cells survived
cyclophosphamide treatment due to reduced proliferation, apoptotic tolerance, and elevated
expression of chemoresistance-related genes. Overexpression of miR-200 abrogated this
resistance. This study suggests the potential of an EMT-targeting strategy, in conjunction with
conventional chemotherapies, for breast cancer treatment.

Despite significant advances in diagnosing and treating cancer, metastasis persists as a
1
barricade to successful therapy and the main cause of cancer-related death . The epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT), wherein epithelial cells depolarize, lose their cell-cell
contacts, and gain an elongated, fibroblast-like morphology, is a potential mechanism by
which tumor cells gain metastatic features. Functional implications of EMT include
23
enhanced mobility, invasion, and resistance to apoptotic stimuli , . Moreover, through EMT
tumor cells acquire cancer stem cell, secondary tumor-initiating and chemoresistance
4 6
properties – . However, the importance of EMT in vivo is fiercely debated due to significant
challenges: mesenchymal tumor cells cannot easily be distinguished from neighboring
7
stromal cells, and metastatic lesions mostly exhibit epithelial phenotypes . The latter may be
due to the hypothesized reverse process, mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), of the
disseminated tumor cells. Studies have confirmed that mesenchymal cells are more capable
of escaping the primary tumor, and of reaching distant sites, but it remains unproven that
those same cells complete the full metastatic cascade in the form of a secondary nodule.
Without evidence for the dissemination, colonization, and metastatic outgrowth of
mesenchymal tumor cells, the role of EMT will remain contested. In this study, we
employed multiple transgenic mouse models, establishing a cell lineage tracing approach
together with characterization of epithelial and mesenchymal markers, to address the
requirement of EMT in metastasis. The newly established transgenic model also provided us
a unique opportunity to study the contribution of EMT to chemoresistance.

EMT lineage tracing during metastasis
Author Manuscript

To track EMT during metastasis in vivo, we generated a mesenchymal-specific, Cremediated fluorescent marker switch strategy and established a triple transgenic mouse model
(Tri-PyMT, MMTV-PyMT/Rosa26-RFP-GFP/Fsp1-Cre, Fig. 1a). In these mice, spontaneous
multifocal breast adenocarcinomas with distinct epithelial characteristics resembling the
human luminal subtype develop in the mammary glands, and give rise to lung metastases
89
with high penetrance , . The FSP1 (fibroblast specific protein 1) promoter drives expression
10
of Cre recombinase in cells of mesenchymal lineage . A Cre-switchable fluorescent marker
(lox-RFP-stop-lox-GFP) is ubiquitously expressed under the control of the β-actin promoter

in the Rosa26 locus . FSP1 is the critical gate-keeping gene of EMT initiation , and its
13
early activation in this process allows for lineage tracing of tumor cells that have
undergone EMT in vivo. Importantly, the color switch system is irreversible—even if the
14
mesenchymal tumor cells undergo MET in the metastatic organs , they would remain GFP
+.

Author Manuscript

Primary breast tumors developed in the Tri-PyMT mice at 8 weeks of age.
Immunofluorescence revealed that the majority of tumor cells, identified by PyMT oncogene
expression, were RFP positive (Fig. 1b). These cells expressed E-cadherin and lacked
vimentin (Extended Data Fig.1a) indicating their epithelial phenotype. The GFP+ cells
detected in the tumor bed were largely hematopoietic cells as they are PyMT negative and
express CD45, a pan-hematopoietic marker (Extended Data Fig.1a), which is consistent with
15
previous reports . Altogether, this data suggests that tumor cells maintain their original RFP
expression and epithelial phenotype in the primary tumor.
Lung metastasis developed spontaneously in Tri-PyMT lungs at 12 weeks of age.
Surprisingly, the PyMT-positive metastatic lesions were RFP+ (Fig. 1c), and epithelial (Ecadherin+/vimentin-) (Extended Data Fig.1b), whereas only non-tumor cells expressed GFP.
These results indicate that tumor cells did not activate the mesenchymal-specific FSP1
promoter, and retained their epithelial phenotype during metastasis. Thus, tumor cells may
not undergo EMT to form metastatic lesions.

Lineage tracing in additional models

Author Manuscript

To exclude the possibility that the absence of EMT in metastasis may be unique to PyMT16
driven breast tumors, we established EMT lineage tracing in the Neu oncogene-driven
spontaneous breast cancer model (MMTV-neu/Rosa26-RFP-GFP/Fsp1-Cre, Tri-neu mouse).
The Neu (ErbB-2) proto-oncogene is associated with 20–30% of human breast cancers, and
MMTV-Neu transgenic mice spontaneously develop focal adenocarcinomas resembling
human luminal phenotypes after an extended latency at 6–8 months of age. Lung metastases
are frequently (72%) observed in these transgenic mice at 9–12 months of age. Mirroring the
Tri-PyMT model, the Neu+ tumor cells in both primary and metastatic lesions in Tri-Neu
mice were also RFP+ and epithelial (E-cad+/Vim-) (Extended Data Fig. 2). Therefore, the
absence of EMT during metastasis formation is an oncogene-independent phenomenon,
manifesting in both PyMT and Neu-driven tumors.

Author Manuscript

To overcome the limitation of using solely Fsp1-Cre to indicate EMT, we acquired the
Vimentin-CreERT transgenic mouse, which successfully traced mesenchymal lineage cells
17
during liver fibrosis , and generated an additional EMT lineage tracing model (TriPyMT/Vim mice, MMTV-PyMT/Rosa26-RFP-GFP/Vimentin-CreERT). After continuous
induction of Cre activity by Tamoxifen injection (2mg, i.p., 3 times per week starting when
the primary tumors appear at 8 weeks of age) the majority of tumor cells in both the primary
and metastatic lesions in Tri-PyMT/Vim mice were RFP+ (Extended Data Fig. 3)—
suggesting an absence of vimentin promoter activation during lung metastasis formation.
EMT marker staining also revealed the epithelial phenotype (E-cad+/Vim-) of the tumor
cells in both primary and metastatic lesions (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Together, results from two oncogene-driven metastatic tumor models (MMTV-PyMT and
MMTV-Neu) and two independent mesenchymal-specific reporters (Vim-Cre and Fsp1-Cre)
suggest that EMT does not significantly contribute to the development of lung metastases.

Validating EMT lineage tracing

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the EMT lineage tracing system, we established
a cell line from the Tri-PyMT breast tumors. In culture, RFP+ Tri-PyMT cells switched their
fluorescent marker expression to GFP, as indicated by the presence of a RFP+/GFP+ doublepositive transitioning population (Fig. 2a). The cells were cultured in 10% FBS, and serum
18
is known to be enriched for many EMT promoting factors including TGFs . Moreover,
addition of TGF-β1 in low-serum conditions (2% FBS), yielded an increase in GFP+ cells
(Extended Data Fig. 4a). In concert with the fluorescent marker switch, Tri-PyMT cells
changed their morphology from cobblestone-like clusters of epithelial cells to dispersed
spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells (Fig. 2b). Reflecting the morphologic differences, the
GFP+ cells were more motile than RFP+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 4b).

Author Manuscript

The fidelity of the EMT lineage tracing system was confirmed by analysis of EMT marker
expression in sorted RFP+ and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells. RFP+ cells expressed elevated levels
of epithelial markers including E-cadherin and Occludin, while GFP+ cells expressed
several mesenchymal markers including vimentin, FSP1, Twist, Zeb1 and Zeb2 as
determined by Q-RT-PCR (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Both RFP+ and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells
expressed the PyMT oncogene. Consistently, western blot analysis confirmed the differential
expression of E-cadherin and vimentin in RFP+ and GFP+ cells (Fig. 2c). Flow cytometry
for E-cadherin revealed that the majority of E-cadherin-negative cells were GFP+ (97.4%)
(Extended Data Fig. 4d). Of note, the E-cadherin+ cells were either RFP+ (93.6%) or RFP
+/GFP+ (6.0%), demonstrating that tumor cells switch their fluorescent marker expression
prior to the loss of epithelial markers, and validating the early reporting of EMT in our
system. These results confirm that the FSP1-Cre-mediated fluorescent marker switch in
tumor cells reports EMT with high fidelity and efficiency.

Rare EMT events in tumor progression

Author Manuscript

In the triple-transgenic models, ubiquitous expression of GFP in the tumor microevironment
precluded detection of potentially rare GFP+ tumor cells. To confine the fluorescence to
tumor cells, we established an orthotopic model by implanting purified RFP+ Tri-PyMT
cells in the wild type mice (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with observations in the
triple transgenic mice, primary tumors contained RFP+ epithelial cells (Fig. 2d). However,
GFP+ cells were detected, indicating tumor EMT (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 5c, upper
panel). These cells lacked E-cadherin (Extended Data Fig. 5c, upper panel) and made up
1.98 ± 1.40% (n=6) of the total tumor cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Q-RT-PCR analysis of
EMT markers comparing sorted RFP+ and GFP+ cells from the same primary tumor
confirmed the mesenchymal phenotype of the GFP+ cells (Fig. 2e). Importantly, these GFP+
EMT tumor cells did not contribute to lung metastasis. Early disseminated tumor cells
detected in the lungs were epithelial and RFP+ (Extended Data Fig. 5c, middle panel), and

28 lung nodules detected in 8 mice maintained the epithelial phenotype (Fig. 2d, Extended
Data Fig. 5c lower panel).
We also established an orthotopic Tri-PyMT/Vim model, wherein Tamoxifen was
administered directly after orthotopic injection to ensure immediate tracing of EMT events.
Consistently, the majority of tumor cells in both primary and metastatic tumors were RFP+
and epithelial (Extended Data Fig. 6). Again, GFP+ EMT events (4.46 ± 1.0% of total tumor
cells, n=3) were detected in the primary tumors.

Author Manuscript

To further dissect the metastatic cascade, we quantified the relative numbers of RFP+ and
GFP+ cells in the primary tumor, blood, and metastases of the Tri-PyMT orthotopic model
by flow cytometry. An RFP to GFP ratio of ∼100:1 in the primary tumor and ∼15:1 in the
blood was observed (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). However, gain by GFP+ cells did not
translate to an advantage in metastatic outgrowth, as the RFP:GFP ratio in the lung was
∼150:1. Altogether, these findings are consistent with our observations in the tripletransgenic models, suggesting that the majority of breast tumor cells persist in an epithelial
state during primary tumor growth and lung metastasis formation.

EMT inhibition and metastasis formation

Author Manuscript

In spite of the extensive characterization of the EMT reporter system, there was still the
distant possibility of our reporter failing to manifest all EMT events in vivo. Therefore, we
sought to inhibit EMT and determine its impact on metastasis. We ectopically expressed
miR-200, a well-known inhibitor of EMT that directly targets ZEB1 and ZEB2 – the
19 20
transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin , . We posited that stably expressing miR-200 in
Tri-PyMT cells would block EMT and trap tumor cells in a permanent epithelial state.
Compared with control cells, miR-200 overexpressing cells (Extended Data Fig. 7c) showed
elevated expression of epithelial cell markers and reduced expression of mesenchymal
markers (Extended Data Fig. 7d). As expected, overexpression of miR-200 inhibited the
RFP to GFP conversion (> 90% remaining RFP+, Fig. 3a). These results substantiate
effective miR-200 suppression of EMT in the Tri-PyMT cells.
To explore the impact of inhibiting EMT on metastasis formation in vivo, we orthotopically
injected miR-200 overexpressing Tri-PyMT cells. We identified 18 metastases in 5 mice, a
similar ratio to that observed in mice bearing control Tri-PyMT cells (28 metastases in 8
mice) (Fig. 3b,c). These results demonstrate that inhibition of EMT by miR-200
overexpression does not impair the ability of tumor cells to form distant lung metastases.

EMT is involved in chemoresistance

the acquisition of chemoresistance induces specific molecular changes consistent with EMT,
we evaluated the orthotopic Tri-PyMT model under chemotherapy. Animals with established
primary tumors were treated with cyclophosphamide, a commonly used drug in breast

cancer treatment (CTX, 100mg/kg, once per week, for 2 weeks prior, and 2 weeks after
surgery Fig. 4a). The tumors responded to chemotherapy, manifesting a 60% reduction in
growth and markedly enhanced apoptotic activity (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c). Of note, the
RFP+ cells were highly proliferative and apoptotic in comparison with GFP+ cells in CTXtreated mice (Extended Data Fig. 8d–g), suggesting that GFP+ cells have reduced
susceptibility to chemotherapy. However, in the primary tumor, the GFP+ cell percentage
remained static under CTX treatment (Extended Data Fig. 8h).

Author Manuscript

Remarkably, in the early metastatic lungs (4 weeks after tumor inoculation), flow cytometry
analysis revealed a 2.7:1 ratio of GFP+ to RFP+ cells in CTX-treated mice (Fig. 4b).
Subsequently at 4 weeks after cessation of treatment, a significant contribution of GFP+
tumor cells was detected in 5 out of 17 metastatic lesions (Fig. 4a). This is in contrast to
untreated mice, where all metastatic lesions were derived from RFP+ cells (Fig. 2d),
suggesting that the EMT process may be involved in metastatic outgrowth in the context of
chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the effects of CTX on the EMT and non-EMT cell populations, sorted GFP+ and
RFP+ cells were incubated with CTX in vitro— the GFP+ cells were markedly more
resistant to both short and long-term treatment (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). The
selective advantage of mesenchymal tumor cells in the context of chemotherapy was then
corroborated by a competitive survival assay in vivo (Fig. 4d). Mice were injected
intravenously with an equivalent number of RFP+ and GFP+ cells, and immediately received
CTX (100mg/kg, once per week). After three weeks, lungs were harvested and the ratio of
RFP+ and GFP+ cells was assessed by flow cytometry. CTX significantly inhibited
outgrowth of lung metastasis from both RFP+ and GFP+ cells (Fig. 4e). The untreated lungs
were morbidly overwhelmed with tumors, with nearly 80% of the tumor cells detected as
RFP+. Conversely, in CTX-treated mice, more than 60% of the surviving tumor cells were
GFP+, producing a significantly higher ratio of GFP:RFP cells in these mice (Fig. 4f). These
results indicate that GFP+ EMT cells are more resistant to chemotherapy both in vitro and in
vivo.
Immunostaining revealed that in the untreated mice, both RFP+ and GFP+ cells formed
epithelial metastatic lesions (E-cad+/Vim-) (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Given the initial
mesenchymal phenotypes of GFP+ cells prior to injection, this suggests that the GFP+ tumor
cells have undergone MET in the metastatic organ. On the other hand, in CTX-treated mice
the majority of surviving tumor cells were scattered mesenchymal GFP+ cells (E-cad-/Vim
+) (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Together, these observations suggest that EMT tumor cells that
sustain a mesenchymal phenotype are resistant to chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

To begin to investigate the molecular underpinnings of mesenchymal tumor cell resistance,
we analyzed the transcriptomic changes of EMT tumor cells. We sorted RFP+ and GFP+
cells and performed RNA-sequencing analysis (Supplementary Information Table 1). In
addition to the expected changes in EMT marker expression (Extended Data Fig. 10a), the
expression of many cell proliferation-related genes was reduced in GFP+ cells (Extended
Data Fig. 10b), mirroring their phenotype of reduced proliferation in vivo. The GFP+ cells
also showed increased expression of proven chemoresistance-related genes including IL6,

Prrx1, Periostin, Enpp2, and Pdgfr – . Additionally, the CTX-treated GFP+ cells elevated
their expression of many drug-metabolizing enzymes including drug transporters (Abcb1a,
Abcb1b, and Abcc1), aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), cytochrome P450s, and
glutathione metabolism related enzymes (Extended Data Fig. 10c). The main toxicity of
CTX is due to its metabolite phosphoramide mustard, which is only formed in cells with low
levels of ALDHs. ALDH converts the CTX-metabolite aldophosphamide into the non-toxic
30
carboxyphosphamide . In accordance with the transcriptomic data, GFP+ cells had
significantly higher ALDH activity compared with RFP+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 10d).
These properties of reduced proliferation, increased apoptotic resistance, and upregulation of
chemoresistance and drug metabolizing genes in GFP+ EMT tumor cells may contribute to
their insensitivity to CTX. Notably, GFP+ cells were also refractory to other commonly used
chemotherapies including doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and 5-FU treatment (Extended Data Fig.
10e).

Author Manuscript

To demonstrate that the EMT is required for the generation of CTX resistance, we first
tested in vitro the effect of treatment on control and miR-200 overexpressing Tri-PyMT
cells. With increasing concentrations of CTX, the miR-200 cells were significantly more
susceptible to therapy (Fig. 5a). We then expanded upon this finding in vivo, establishing
orthotopic control and miR-200 primary tumors, and applying the pre-and-post surgery CTX
regimen. We found that by blocking EMT in tumor cells, we effectively ablated metastatic
growth (Fig. 5b,c). Thus, EMT contributes to the development of chemoresistant metastasis.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Using two independent EMT lineage tracing strategies in two disparate oncogene-driven
autochthonous models of breast cancer, we demonstrated that lung metastases are derived
2 31
from non-EMT tumor cells, contradicting the original EMT/MET hypothesis , . In a tracing
system similar to our own, EMT was identified in primary tumors, but the mesenchymal
32
lineage status of the metastatic nodules was not pursued . Ultimately in our models we
found that tumor cells disseminate and form metastases while persisting in their epithelial
33
phenotype, in accordance with a recent study . To underline that EMT is not required for
metastasis, overexpression of miR-200—a microRNA that is incongruously associated with
19 20
34
both reduced invasion , and increased metastasis —resulted in combined suppression of
the EMT-promoting transcription factors Snail1/2, Twist, Zeb1 and Zeb2, but had no effect
on metastasis. Given that both epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells have the potential to
disseminate, it is plausible that the larger fraction of highly proliferative epithelial cells outcompete the minor EMT tumor cell population in generating macrometastatic lesions.

Author Manuscript

Until now, the majority of data connecting EMT with chemoresistance was largely derived
from in vitro studies, or clinical prognostic data. We demonstrated that highly proliferative
non-EMT cells were sensitive to chemotherapy, and the emergence of recurrent EMTderived metastases was observed after treatment. There is a great emphasis towards
35 36
developing EMT-targeting therapies , , and our studies suggest that while EMT blockade
may not affect metastasis formation, specifically targeting EMT tumor cells will be
synergistic with conventional chemotherapy. Thus, our EMT lineage tracing system provides

a unique preclinical platform to develop combination therapies that will eliminate both
populations, and combat chemoresistance.

Methods
Animals

Author Manuscript

Wild type C57BL/6 and FVB/n mice, and transgenic mice with ACTB-tdTomato-EGFP
(Stock# 007676), FSP1-Cre (Stock# 012641), MMTV-PyMT (Stock# 002374), and MMTVNeu (Stock# 002376) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). The
Vimentin-Cre mouse was a kind gift from the laboratory of Dr. Schwabe at Columbia
University. CB-17 SCID mice were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). All
mouse strains obtained were bred in the animal facility at WCMC. All animal work was
conducted in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Weill Cornell Medical College.
The ACTB-tdTomato-EGFP and FSP1-Cre mice were bred together to obtain double
transgenic mice and then bred with MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-Neu mice to obtain the TriPyMT and Tri-Neu triple transgenic mice, respectively. Double transgenic male mice
carrying ACTB-tdTomato-EGFP and MMTV-PyMT alle were crossed with the VimentinCre mice to obtain the Tri-PyMT-Vim triple transgenic mice. Genotyping for each transgenic
line was performed following the standardized protocols as described in the website of The
Jackson Laboratory. Genotyping for Vimentin-Cre was done using forward primer 5′CCCCTTCCTCACTTCTTTCC and reverse primer 5′-ATGTTTAGCTGGCCCAAATG.
Tamoxifen Injection

Author Manuscript

To induce Vim-Cre activities in the Tri-PyMT/Vim mice, Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, 2 mg/
mouse dissolved in corn oil) was administered through intraperitoneal injections, 3 times per
week starting when the primary tumors appear (at 8 weeks of age) and continuing for 6
weeks until metastasis developed in the lung.
Establishing Tri-PyMT cell line
The primary tumor of the Tri-PyMT mouse (12 weeks old female) was surgically removed
under sterile conditions. Tumor tissue was sliced into ∼1 mm3 blocks and implanted into the
fat pad (#4 on the right side) of CB-17 SCID mice. The secondary tumor was used to
establish the Tri-PyMT cell line, eliminating the contamination of fluorescent positive
stromal cells in the tumor tissue from Tri-PyMT transgenic mice.

Author Manuscript

Tumor tissue was minced and digested with an enzyme cocktail (Collagenase A, elastase,
and DNase I, Roche Applied Science) in HBSS buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. The cell
suspension was strained through a 40µm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Cells were washed
with PBS 3 times and uploaded in the Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The sorted RFP
+ cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The PyMT
oncogene expression in the established cell line was confirmed by RT-PCR (Extended Data
Fig. 4c). The tumorigenic ability of these cells was confirmed throughout the study.

To determine EMT induction by TGF-β, cells were cultured for one week in DMEM with
2% FBS and 2ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems). The GFP+ cell ratio was quantified by flow
cytometry.
To generate the miR-200 overexpressing cell line, a pLenti 4.1 Ex miR200b-200a-429
20
construct , was obtained from Addgene. To eliminate the contamination of fluorescent
marker expression in targeted cells, the GFP gene in this construct was removed by BstBI/
XbaI digestion followed by blunted self-ligation. Lentivirus was packaged by co-transfection
of the pLenti-miR200s construct and packaging plasmids into HEK293T cells. Tri-PyMT
cells (passage 2) were infected with the lentivirus. Infected cells (Tri-PyMT miR-200) were
selected by culturing with puromycin (2µg/mL) for 14 days. A control Tri-PyMT cell line
was generated by infecting cells with lentivirus carrying the puromycin resistance gene,
following the same procedure in parallel.

Orthotopic breast tumor model

Author Manuscript

To establish an orthotopic breast tumor model, we first purified RFP+ cells from passages
10–15 of Tri-PyMT cell culture by FACS. The purified RFP+ Tri-PyMT cells (1×106 cells
with purity >99%, Extended Data Fig. 5a) were injected into the mammary fat pad of 8week old female CB-17 SCID mice. The growth of the primary tumor was monitored by
external caliper measurement once a week. In approximately 4 weeks, the primary tumor
was surgically removed and the incision was closed with wound clips. The tumor size did
not exceed 5% of total body weight as permitted in the IACUC protocol. Animals were
sacrificed 4 weeks after primary tumor removal to analyze the development of pulmonary
metastasis. For animals subjected to chemotherapy, Cyclophosphamide (CTX, SigmaAldrich, 100mg/kg) was administered once per week, for 2 weeks prior and 2 weeks after
surgery.
Tissue processing, Immunofluorescence and Microscopy
The harvested primary tumors and PBS-perfused lungs bearing metastases were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight, followed by 30% sucrose for 2 days, and then embedded in
Tissue-tek O.C.T. embedding compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Serial sections
(10µm, at least 10 sections) were prepared for histological analysis by Hematoxylin & Eosin
(H&E) staining, and immunofluorescent staining following standardized protocols.

Primary antibodies used in this study include CD45 (30-F11, BioLegend), E-cadherin
(DECMA-1, BioLegend), vimentin (sc-7557, Santa Cruz), PyMT (ab15085, Abcam), Neu
(sc-284, Santa Cruz), Ki67 (ab15580, Abcam), and Active Caspase-3 (C92–605, BD
Pharmingen). Primary antibodies were directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 using an
antibody labeling kit (Invitrogen) performed as per manufacturer’s instructions and purified
over BioSpin P30 columns (Bio-Rad). GFP+ and RFP+ cells were detected by inherent
fluorescence.
Fluorescent images were obtained using a computerized Zeiss fluorescent microscope
(Axiovert 200M), fitted with an apotome and an HRM camera. Images were analyzed using
Axiovision 4.6 software (Carl Zeiss Inc.).

Flow cytometry and cell sorting

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

For the metastatic lungs and primary tumors, cell suspensions were prepared by digesting
tissues with an enzyme cocktail (Collagenase A, elastase, and DNase I, Roche Applied
Science) in HBSS buffer at 37°C for 30 min. For cultured cells, cells were collected through
trypsinization. A single cell suspension was prepared by filtering through a 30-µm cell
strainer (BD Biosciences). Then cells were stained following a standard immunostaining
protocol. Briefly, cells were pre-blocked with 2% FBS plus Fc block (CD16/CD32, 1:30,
BD Biosciences) and then incubated with the primary antibody against E-cadherin
(DECMA-1, BioLegend). SYTOX Blue (Invitrogen) was added to the staining tube in the
last 5 minutes to facilitate the elimination of dead cells. GFP+ and RFP+ cells were detected
by their intrinsic signals. The stained samples were analyzed using the LSRII flow cytometer
coupled with FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry analysis was
performed using a variety of controls including isotype antibodies, unstained and single
color stained samples for determining appropriate gates, voltages, and compensations
required in multivariate flow cytometry.
For sorting live cells back for further culturing or injection into animals, we used the Aria II
cell sorter coupled with FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). The preparation of cells for
sorting was performed under sterile conditions. The purity of subpopulations after sorting
was confirmed by analyzing post-sort samples in the sorter again.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and miRNA via the mirVana
miRNA isolation kit (Life Technologies), and converted to cDNA using qScript™ cDNA
SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences) and RT-PCR. Q-PCR was performed with the appropriate
primers (sequences shown in the table) and iQ™ SYBER Green master mix (Bio-Rad). PCR
protocol: initial denaturing at 95°C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 20 sec, 60°C for 30 sec,
and 72°C for 30 sec, followed by final extension at 72°C for 5 min and melt curve analysis
was applied on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real Time System (Bio-Rad) coupled with Bio-Rad-CFX
Manager software.
RNA-sequencing analysis

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted from sorted RFP+ and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells with the RNeasy Kit
(Qiagen). RNA-Seq libraries was constructed and sequenced following standard protocols
(Illumina). Single-end RNA-seq reads were mapped to UCSC mouse genome (GRCm38/
mm10) using Tophat2. FPKM values for each gene were estimated by Cufflinks and
statistical analysis was done using Cuffdiff2. Heatmaps for differentially expressed genes
with adjusted p value <0.05 were drawn using gplots R package.
Western blot analysis
Cells were homogenized in 1x RIPA lysis buffer (Millipore) with protease inhibitors (Roche
Applied Science). Samples were boiled in 1x Laemmli buffer and 10% β-mercaptoethanol,
and loaded onto 12% gradient Tris-Glycine gels (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed
using antibodies specific for E-cadherin (clone DECMA-1), vimentin (clone RV202, BD
Pharmingen), and β-actin (clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich).

Cell apoptosis & viability assays

Author Manuscript

To determine apoptosis of RFP+ and GFP+ cells, Tri-PyMT cells (Passage 10) were seeded
on adherent 6-well plates (1×106 cells), and treated with 4-Hydroperoxy Cyclophosphamide
(Santa Cruz) for 48 hours. After treatment, cells were trypsinized and stained with APC
conjugated Annexin V (BD Biosciences) and SYTOX Blue (Invitrogen) for apoptotic cells
labeling. The stained cells were analyzed in the LSRII flow cytometer to quantify the
percentage of apoptotic, dead, and live RFP+ and GFP+ cells by FACS Diva software. To
determine the viability of Tri-PyMT Control and +miR-200 cells treated with CTX, cells
were plated in 96-well adherent black-walled plates (1×104 cells), and treated with 4Hydroperoxy Cyclophosphamide for 48 hours. After treatment, cell viability was measured
with the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega).
Cell migration assay

Author Manuscript

1×105 Tri-PyMT cells were seeded in a 6-well plate. Real time images of cells (including
phase, GFP and RFP channels) were taken under a computerized Zeiss microscope
(Axiovert observation) every 10 minutes for 10 hours. Movement of individual cells (>10
RFP+ and >10 GFP+ cells in each field, >2 fields were analyzed) were tracked with ImageJ
software, and the distance that was traveled during that time was measured as indicated.
ALDH activity assay

Author Manuscript

RFP+ and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells (1×106 cells each) were freshly sorted from culture by
FACS and then homogenized in cold ALDH Assay buffer provided in the ALDH Activity
Colorimetric Assay Kit (Biovision Inc.) Following the protocol, ALDH substrate and
acetaldehyde were added. ALDH activities in samples were measured by OD at 450 nm in a
kinetic mode (every 3 minute for 60 min).
Statistical Analysis
To determine the sample size of animal experiments, we used power analysis assuming the
(difference in means)/(standard deviation) is >2.5. Therefore, all animal experiments were
conducted with ≥ 5 mice per group to ensure adequate power between groups by two-sample
t-test comparison. Animals were randomized within each experimental group. No blinding
was applied in performing experiments. Results were expressed as mean ± SEM. Data
distribution in groups and significance between different treatment groups was analyzed by
using the Mann-Whitney T test in GraphPad Prism software. P values < 0.05 were
considered significant. Error bars depict SEM, except where indicated otherwise.

a, Schema of cyclophosphamide (CTX) treatment in Tri-PyMT orthotopic model. Mice
bearing an RFP+ primary tumor were treated with CTX (100mg/kg, once per week, for 4
weeks, as indicated by blue arrows). After two weeks of treatment, PT was removed (black
arrow). Lung metastasis growth was permitted for 4 weeks post CTX treatment. Fluorescent
imaging of lungs revealed the contribution of GFP+ tumor cells to lung metastases (n=9
mice).
b, Ratio of GFP+ to RFP+ cells in early metastatic lungs (4 weeks post orthotopic injection)
of untreated (Cont) and CTX-treated (+CTX) mice as quantified by flow cytometry (n=4,
*p<0.05).
c, Apoptosis (as measured by Annexin binding) of RFP+ and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells treated
with CTX (n=2 biological replicates).

d, Flow cytometry scatter plot showing the proportions of RFP+ and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells
prior to intravenous injection. Mice were treated with CTX (100mg/kg per week for 3
weeks, n=5 mice per group).
e, Quantification of flow cytometry data showing the percentage of RFP+ and GFP+ tumor
cells (red and green bars, respectively) of total cells in the lung of the Control and CTX
treated mice (CTX) (n=5 mice per group, *p<0.05).
f, Quantification of flow cytometry data showing the ratio of GFP+ to RFP+ cells in lungs of
Control and CTX-treated mice. Black line represents the starting ratio of GFP+ to RFP+
cells prior to injection as derived from the data in Fig. 4d (*p<0.05).
