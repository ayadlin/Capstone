BACKGROUND: Docetaxel is the standard of care for patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC). Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue with broad antitumor activity. In a phase 2 study of combined docetaxel and gemcitabine, the authors assessed its safety and activity in patients with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic
CRPC. METHODS: Eligible patients had untreated, metastatic CRPC with radiologic and/or biochemical evidence of
progression after antiandrogen withdrawal with castrate testosterone levels, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 2, and adequate organ function; no previous chemotherapy was permitted.
Patients received gemcitabine (800 mg/m2) Days 1 and 8 and docetaxel (75 mg/m2) on Day 8 every 21 days for a
maximum of 6 cycles. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for
measurable disease. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was defined as a decline 50% in baseline PSA level.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic CRPC were enrolled. The median age was 67
years, and 60% of patients had an ECOG PS of 0. PSA responses were observed in 49% of patients. Among
the patients who had measurable disease (n ¼ 25), 3 patients (12%) had a confirmed, RECIST-defined partial response
(PR); 4 patients (16%) had an unconfirmed PR; and 15 patients (60%) achieved stable disease. The most
common adverse events included grade 1 and 2 fatigue (69%), alopecia (80%), and nausea/vomiting (54%). No treatment-related deaths were noted, but an unusually high incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of combined gemcitabine and docetaxel in metastatic CRPC was similar to that
observed with single-agent docetaxel. In contrast to single-agent docetaxel, the combination was moderately toxic

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death among men in the United States, and >192,280 new cases were

diagnosed in 2009.1 Although the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer have an initial response to androgendeprivation therapy, all patients eventually will progress to a castrate-resistant state, which is manifested by rising levels of
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), progressive disease on imaging studies, worsening of symptoms, and, ultimately, death.2
Patients with progressive prostate cancer despite anorchid testosterone levels are considered ‘‘castrate resistant.’’ The treatment of patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has evolved significantly in the last several
years. Chemotherapeutic options for patients with advanced disease, once considered a futile endeavor, have changed significantly with the understanding that docetaxel-based chemotherapy produces palliative benefits and leads to an overall
survival improvement in patients with CRPC.3,4 Despite its clinical benefits, the response to docetaxel often is short lived,
and all patients eventually develop progressive disease.
Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog that has activity against a broad spectrum of solid tumors.5 Although in vitro
work has suggested significant activity in prostate cancer cell lines,6 existing clinical data suggest modest clinical activity
when gemcitabine is used as a single agent in CRPC.7 A series of phase 1 and 2 trials that evaluated the combination of
gemcitabine plus docetaxel provided some evidence of a potential synergistic or additive effect when these 2 agents are

used together.8-13 The objective of the current, multiinstitutional, phase 2 trial was to evaluate the efficacy,
safety, and tolerability of this combination in patients
with previously untreated, metastatic CRPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with metastases and evidence of
disease progression (worsening disease observed on bone
scans, an increase in measurable disease, or a PSA >5 ng/
mL and increasing on 2 consecutive measurements 1 week
apart) despite at least 1 endocrine manipulation and testosterone levels <50 ng/dL. Patients who had received
antiandrogen therapy were required to demonstrate
progressive disease after appropriate withdrawal from
therapy. Androgen-deprivation therapy with a luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or orchiectomy was required for the duration of the study. Other
inclusion criteria were a Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 and
adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function (as
defined by a white blood cell count 1500/lL, a platelet
count 100,000/lL, hemoglobin 8.0 g/dL, aspartate
and alanine aminotransferase levels 2 times the upper
limit of normal [ULN], and serum bilirubin 1.5 times
the ULN. Patients who had received previous chemotherapy for CRPC were excluded; however, the receipt of
neoadjuvant or adjuvant (nontaxane) chemotherapy was
allowed >1 year before study entry. Other exclusion criteria included previous radiation therapy within 4 weeks of
study entry and a history of severe cardiovascular disease
(class III/IV intra-abdominal hypertension), uncontrolled
congestive heart failure, or ventricular arrhythmia. The
Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board reviewed
and approved this study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on
Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All
patients provided written informed consent before
registration.
Treatment consisted of Gemcitabine (Gemzar; Lilly
Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, Ind) 800 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 to 60 minutes on Day 1 and 8
of each treatment cycle and docetaxel (Taxotere; SanofiAventis Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) 75 mg/m2
administered intravenously over 30 to 60 minutes on Day
8 followed the Day 8 infusion of gemcitabine. All patients
received oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily with standard
antiemetic and supportive care. Prophylactic use of white

blood cell and erythrocyte growth factors was not
permitted.
All patients were required to have an absolute
granulocyte count 1.5.109/L and/or a platelet count
100.109/L on Day 1 and Day 8 of any cycle before they
received treatment. Dose reductions of 25% and 50%
were implemented for any initial and subsequent delay
of Day-8 chemotherapy. Adverse events were graded
according to version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
Treatment was administered weekly for 2 consecutive
weeks on a 21-day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles or
until disease progression was assessed by the investigators
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST),14 unacceptable toxicity, or consent
withdrawal.
Baseline evaluations included medical history and
physical examination, laboratory parameters (hematology
and blood chemistry, including testosterone level and
PSA), and tumor imaging (computed tomography [CT]
scans or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] studies of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis; bone scan; and brain CT or
MRI scans). Tumor assessments were performed at baseline and every 8 weeks.

Efficacy Assessment
PSA values were obtained before each cycle of chemotherapy. A PSA response was defined as a decline >50% that
was maintained for at least 4 weeks. PSA progression was
defined as a 25% increase in PSA over the nadir value that
was confirmed by a second PSA evaluation at least 1 week
later. A complete PSA response required normalization
of PSA (<4 ng/mL) for at least 21 days. Patients with
measurable soft tissue disease were assessed according to
RECIST. Complete responses required the complete disappearance of all evidence of all sites of measurable or osseous disease with normalization of the PSA level (defined
as PSA <4 ng/mL). A partial response was defined according to RECIST as a reduction 50% in PSA without the
appearance of new osseous lesions, and worsening pathologic findings. Progressive disease was defined as a progression in the PSA level, an increase in the size of existent
bone lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new bone
lesions identified on bone scan. The time to progression
was measured from the first day of treatment to the time
of disease progression. Overall survival was measured
from the initiation of therapy to the date of death or last
follow-up.

Statistical Methods
The primary endpoints of the study were to determine the
safety and efficacy of combined gemcitabine plus docetaxel in patients with untreated, metastatic CRPC. A 2stage accrual design with a maximum goal of 34 eligible
and evaluable patients was used to test the hypothesis that
the underlying overall response rate (PSA for patients
with nonmeasurable disease and RECIST-defined for
patients with measurable disease) was essentially 20%
versus 40%, respectively. The study was designed with
a ¼ .11 and power of 0.90. Seventeen eligible and evaluable patients were enrolled in the first accrual stage, and
an additional 17 patients were enrolled in stage 2 if 4 of
the 17 stage 1 patients responded. Survival was calculated
from the date of study registration to the date of death or
last follow-up; and was summarized using the method of
Kaplan and Meier. Spearman rank correlations were used
to assess associations, such as the relation between a PSA
decrease and a measurable disease reduction.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between July 2004 and October 2006, 35 patients with
chemotherapy-naive, metastatic CRPC were enrolled.
Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The
median patient age was 67 years, and most patients (60%)
had an ECOG performance status of 0. All patients had
undergone either surgical or medical castration and demonstrated castrate levels of testosterone during study treatment. Similarly, all but 3 patients (9%) had received
antiandrogen treatment either as part of their initial
androgen-deprivation therapy or as a second-line hormone manipulation. Twenty-four patients (69%) had
received previous radiation therapy, and 8 patients (23%)
had undergone radical prostatectomy. Only 1 patient had
received previous chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting.
Pretreatment PSA levels ranged from 1.50 ng/mL to
938.6 ng/mL. Although the vast majority of patients
(71%) had RECIST-defined, measurable disease before
study entry, 10 patients (29%) had documented bone disease with either radiographic progression, a rising PSA, or
worsening clinical symptoms.
Efficacy Results
All patients were evaluable for response. The vast majority
of patients (29 of 35; 83%) experienced some PSA decline
while they were receiving treatment. Seventeen patients
(49%) achieved a PSA response. Among these, 6 patients

(17%) had a PSA decrease 95%. The median time to
PSA nadir in these patients was 3.4 months (range, from 3
weeks to 5.4 months). Figure 1 summarizes the data as a
waterfall plot. Of 25 patients who had measurable disease,
3 patients (12%) had a confirmed, RECIST-defined partial response; 4 patients (16%) had an unconfirmed partial response; and 15 patients (60%) had stable disease,
including reduced tumor burden in 12 patients. Figure 2
illustrates the maximal change in tumor burden of the
evaluable patients. The median reduction in tumor burden was a 26.5% decline (range, from a 72.1% decline to
a 14.3% increase). At the time of this report, 26 patients
had died, and the estimated median survival was 19.4
months (Fig. 3). The median follow-up for the 9 patients
who remained alive at the time of the current analysis was
11.1 months (range, 0.9-48.5 months).
Treatment Administration and
Adverse Events
Twenty-two patients (63%) completed all 6 of the
planned treatment cycles. Thirty-two percent of the cycles
were delayed at least by 1 week, primarily for neutropenia.
Fourteen percent of patients required a dose reduction of
gemcitabine by 25% (n ¼ 4; because of grade 3 neutropenia) and by 50% (n ¼ 1; because of grade 3 diarrhea).
Docetaxel was reduced by 25% in 2 patients who developed grade 3 neutropenia and by 50% in the same patient
who developed grade 3 diarrhea and required a 50%
reduction in the dose of gemcitabine. Four patients discontinued therapy because of PSA progression. Other

reasons for stopping treatment included adverse events
(17%), consent withdrawal (3%), physician discretion
(3%), and death secondary to progressive disease (3%).
The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse
events were constitutional in nature and included grade 1
and 2 fatigue in 24 patients (69%), alopecia in 28 of 35
patients (80%), nausea/vomiting in 19 of 35 patients
(54%), edema in 15 of 35 patients (43%), and peripheral
neuropathy in 9 of 35 patients (26%). The most common
laboratory abnormalities included grade 1 or 2 anemia
(40%), thrombocytopenia (9%), and elevated aspartate
and alanine aminotransferase levels (14%) (Table 2). The
most commonly reported, treatment-related, grade 3
adverse events included neutropenia (34%) followed by
fatigue (15%) and dyspnea (9%). Although there were no
treatment-related deaths, 7 patients (20%) reported grade
4 toxicities (neutropenia in 5 patients, febrile neutropenia
in 1 patient, and neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in
1 patient).

taxel for patients with progressive, metastatic, CRPC.15-17
Various phase 2 studies evaluating novel compounds
administered in combination with docetaxel have been
conducted.18 Challenges in terms of study design, clinical
endpoints, and the relative significant activity of docetaxel
have made the identification of active docetaxel-based
regimens problematic.
In our experience using gemcitabine combined with
docetaxel-based chemotherapy in patients with untreated,
metastatic CRPC, a high proportion of patients achieved
significant PSA reductions. However, only 49% of
patients demonstrated a PSA decline 50% compared
with baseline. In addition, this PSA response did not
differ substantially from that observed in the Southwest
Oncology Group 9916 and TAX-327 studies.3,4 For the
patients who had measurable soft tissue disease, the objective response observed in our study was 28% (3 of 7
patients had a confirmed partial response). Although this
objective response rate is somewhat similar to that
reported in previous phase 2 and 3 docetaxel-based studies,3,4,18 the similarity is probably because of patient selection and the inherent bias of phase 2 trial design.
Our study results differ somewhat with the results
from a recent phase 1/2 experience evaluating the same
combination in patients with CRPC in which PSA and
RECIST-defined responses were observed in 74% and
48% of patients, respectively.19 In that study, the median
time to progression and overall survival also were 7.9
months and 13.9 months, respectively. These overall survival data clearly are inferior to observations in previous
docetaxel-based studies. Although the estimated median

756

overall survival in our study was longer (19.1 months),
our trial was limited by a lack of progression-free survival
data, because follow-up measurements were not continued once treatment stopped; thus, progression-free survival based on measurable disease could not be estimated.
In addition, ours was a single-arm, nonrandomized study,
a design that has limitations in determining the relative
benefit of the combination compared with other treatment strategies in this setting. In addition, we did not
incorporate a pain or quality-of-life measurement tool,
and the endpoints used in the study were developed before
the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group recommendations of 2008.20
Toxicity also appears to be a major limitation of this
combination. Similar to the Danish study, we observed a
higher incidence of myelosuppression (59%; grade 3 in
34% of patients and grade 4 14% of patients) and fatigue
(grade 3 only in 15% of patients) compared with other
single-agent docetaxel trials. Similarly, a greater incidence
of treatment delays was reported. In fact, approximately
33% of planned cycles were delayed because of adverse
events, and almost 15% of patients required a dose reduction of 1 or both agents. Balancing treatment-related toxicity versus clinical efficacy versus quality of life remains a
challenge when treating patients with metastatic CRPC;
thus, such factors should be taken into consideration
when designing clinical trials.
In conclusion, the current results suggest that the
addition of gemcitabine to standard, docetaxel-based
chemotherapy leads to significant toxicities without concomitant clinical benefits over those observed with single-

agent docetaxel. Current phase 3 studies evaluating the
addition of novel targeted agents, such as bevacizumab
and atrasentan, to standard docetaxel may provide evidence supporting the role of docetaxel-based combination
regimens. The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel
has activity in metastatic CRPC but at a significant cost in
terms of toxicity. Further development of this doublet in
prostate cancer is not recommended.
