BACKGROUND. Previous studies have shown cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors who were exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy. Neural damage by
chemotherapy might have played some part in these findings. The current study
explored the regional brain volume difference between breast cancer survivors
exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy (Cþ) and those unexposed (C).
METHODS. High-resolution 1.5-tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) databases of breast cancer survivors and healthy controls were used. Brain images were
preprocessed for optimal voxel-based morphometry. Comparisons of gray matter and
white matter were performed between the Cþ and the C groups, by using MRI scans
from within 1 year (the 1-year study, n ¼ 51 and n ¼ 55, respectively) or 3 years after
their cancer surgery (the 3-year study, n ¼ 73 and n ¼ 59, respectively). As exploratory
analyses, correlation analyses were performed between indices of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and regional brain volume where the volumes were significantly
smaller. As a reference, MRI scans of cancer survivors were compared with those of
healthy controls (n ¼ 55 for the 1-year study and n ¼ 37 for the 3-year study).
RESULTS. The Cþ patients had smaller gray matter and white matter including
prefrontal, parahippocampal, and cingulate gyrus, and precuneus in the 1-year
study. However, no difference was observed in the 3-year study. The volumes of
the prefrontal, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus were significantly corre-

T

he survival rate of breast cancer patients is
increasing with the development of systemic
chemotherapy. In this situation, management of
long-term side effects of potentially curative breast
cancer treatment is of substantial importance to
optimal quality of life of breast cancer survivors.
Recently, impairments of cognitive function, which is
a prerequisite for functioning in daily life, have been
recognized as a possible long-term adverse effect,
which has been termed ‘‘chemobrain’’.1,2 Previous
reviews have shown that most of these studies have
consistently indicated impairments of various cognitive domains in breast cancer survivors exposed to
adjuvant chemotherapy.3–6 However, the neural
mechanisms have not been fully studied.
Neural impairments caused by chemotherapeutic
agents as shown in animals may play a part in these
mechanisms. Although chemotherapeutic agents
were thought initially to have little ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, recent studies have
indicated higher concentrations than were expected
in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue.7–9 Chemotherapeutic agents are hypothesized to have neurotoxic potential through their ability to interfere
with DNA and RNA synthesis and function, inhibition of microtubule formation, and/or immunosuppressive properties.10,11 In animals, intracerebroventricularly injected methotrexate was reported to
cause learning and memory impairments and
damage to the hippocampal CA4 region.12 Injection
of doxorubicin into the caudate-putamen indicated
neuronal death in the ventral tegmentum and thalamus.13 Intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide
produced lesions within the cortex, thalamus, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and caudate nucleus in a
dose-dependent fashion.14 In the same report, cyclophosphamide and methotrexate showed a concentration-dependent neurotoxic effect on neuronal cell
cultures. Another study has demonstrated that free
radicals are a possible mechanism for the toxic effect
of chemotherapeutic agents.15
Recently, neuroimaging techniques have developed dramatically, thus enabling investigation of
brain structure in humans. In a preliminary investigation that used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Saykin et al. reported regional brain
volumes in breast and lymphoma cancer survivors
who lived more than 5 years after their initial treatment.10 Results suggest that chemotherapy may be
associated with reductions in regional brain volume.
However, a further study is needed with a comparison group of cancer patients unexposed to chemotherapy to control for the impact of cancer diagnosis.
Contrary to results of the Saykin et al. investigation,

147

our study showed no significant difference in regional and whole-brain volumes between breast cancer survivors exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy and
those unexposed 3 years after their breast cancer surgery.16 Although a previous study indicated longterm cognitive impairment,17 by taking previous
reports that show recovery of cognitive impairments
over time into consideration,4,18–20 adverse changes
in the brain structure may recover.
In the current study, we explore the regional
brain volume difference between cancer survivors
exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy and those unexposed in a 2-study setting (the 1-year study of <1
year after surgery and the 3-year study of >3 years
after surgery). Our hypothesis was that smaller regional brain volumes would be associated with adjuvant chemotherapy. For secondary analysis, associations were examined between memory functions (as
1 of the cognitive functions) and the regional brain
volume, where the volumes are significantly smaller in
cancer survivors exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board and the Ethics Committee of the National
Cancer Center of Japan and was performed after
obtaining written informed consent from patients.
This study was conducted by using 2 databases of
brain MRI scans from breast cancer survivors. One
database (Long-Term-Survivors Database) comprised
brain MRI scans of patients 3 years after their breast
cancer surgery.16 The other database (Follow-up
Database) comprised brain MRI scans from 3–
15 months after patients’ breast cancer surgery and
additional scans from 2 years after their first scan.

Subjects and Procedures
The 1-year study used baseline data from the Followup Database (Fig. 1). Subjects were recruited during
follow-up visits to the Division of Breast Surgery,
National Cancer Center Hospital East. We selected all
patients who underwent their breast cancer surgery
and who survived >3–15 months. The inclusion criteria were 1) female sex to minimize sex-based brain
differences and 2) ages between 18 and 55 years.
Exclusion criteria were 1) a history of cancer other
than breast cancer or double cancer, 2) bilateral
breast cancer, 3) clear evidence of residual or recurrent cancer, 4) current chemotherapy or radiation
therapy, 5) a history of any neurological disorders,
traumatic brain injury, or psychiatric disorders other
than affective and anxiety disorders, 6) psychotropic

to exclude regional brain volume changes brought
about by these disorders,23 and 12) any contraindication to undergoing an MRI scan.
For the 3-year study, subjects were collected
from the Follow-Up Database and the Long-TermSurvivor Database. From the Follow-Up Database,
105 subjects who participated in the 1-year study
were asked to participate in the follow-up more than
2 years after their 1-year study.16 Figure 1 indicates
a summary of the recruitment of participants to the
1-year study and to the 3-year study.
We recruited healthy subjects, who lived in the
same geographic areas as the patients, by using
advertisements in the local newspaper. The inclusion
and exclusion criteria were the same as those for
cancer patients except for the requirement of a history of breast cancer surgery. Fifty-five healthy controls participated in the 1-year study. After 2 years,
37 of 55 healthy controls participated again in the
3-year study.

Neuropsychological Measurements
The Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Japanese version was performed. The Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R),24 a memory function scale validated
in Japanese,25,26 consists of indices of Attention/Concentration, Immediate Visual Memory, Immediate
Verbal Memory, and Delayed Recall to estimate
memory function. This scale is among the most generalized and widely used in the world.
Image Data Processing for Optimized Voxel-based
Morphometry
MRI scans were conducted on a 1.5-tesla MRI unit
(Signa Scanner, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee,
Wis), with 3-dimensional, spoiled gradient-recalled
acquisition of 1.5-mm contiguous sections under the
following conditions: field of view ¼ 230 mm,
matrix ¼ 256  256 pixels, repetition time ¼ 25 milliseconds, echo time ¼ 5 milliseconds, and flip
angle ¼ 458.16
The theory and algorithm of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for Statistical Parametric Mapping 2
(SPM2) software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive
Neurology, London, UK) have been well documen-

ted.27 VBM was carried out by using an optimized
method.28 First, optimized study-specific template
sets for the 1-year study and for the 3-year study
comprising a T1 image and a priori gray matter,
white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid images were
created on the basis of brain images of participants
in the 1-year study and the 3-year study, respectively.
All scans were spatially normalized to customized
templates, and then they were smoothed with an 8mm, full-width half-maximum (FWHM) smoothing
kernel, followed by averaging to create customized
templates. Next, for the study group MRI scans, a
brain extraction procedure that incorporated a segmentation step was used to remove nonbrain tissue
from the MRI images.28,29 Extracted gray matter and
white matter images were normalized to the gray
matter and white matter templates.27,30 The normalization parameters were then reapplied to the original
structural images to maximize optimal segmentation
of fully normalized images, and these normalized
images were segmented into gray matter/white matter and cerebrospinal fluid/noncerebrospinal fluid
partitions.31 Segmented images were modulated by
the Jacobian determinants from spatial normalization
to correct for volume changes that were introduced
during nonlinear spatial transformations.28 Finally,
images were smoothed with a 12-mm FWHM
kernel.27,32

Statistical Analysis
Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or x2 tests were
used for comparison of background and medical factors. a levels were set at P < .05 (2-tailed).
By using SPM2, group differences in each of the
gray matter and white matter scans were compared
between the cancer patients exposed to their adjuvant chemotherapy and those unexposed, by using
ANCOVA models, respectively, with age, alcohol consumption, intracranial volume, and background characteristics significantly different between these 2
groups (in the 1-year study, number of days after
surgery and current hormonal therapy; in the 3-year
study, handedness and current hormonal therapy) as
nuisance variables. The intracranial volumes (sum of
the gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid
volumes) were calculated from non-normalized segmented images during optimized-VBM preprocessing. Height and weight were not included as
nuisance variables because intracranial volumes
were modeled. Medical factors that seemed to be
causes or results of adjuvant chemotherapy were not
included as nuisance variables to avoid overmatching
between the 2 groups. The groups were compared

Brain Volume After Adjuvant Chemotherapy/Inagaki et al.

using statistical t-test contrasts within SPM2. The
distribution of morphological differences across each
of the total gray matter or white matter was assessed
initially on a voxel-by-voxel basis; clusters of over
400 voxels were used to suppress small clusters possibly arising by chance, and a threshold of P < .001
was used, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Inference was centered on differences that achieved a
significance of P < .05, after family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons.33 In all analyses, we
reported the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
coordinates of voxels of statistical significance.34
To see the effect of cancer on the brain structure
as a reference, MRI scans of cancer survivors were
compared with those of healthy controls, by using
ANCOVA models with age, alcohol consumption, intracranial volume, and background characteristics
significantly different between these 2 groups (in the
1-year study, year of education and menopausal
state; in the 3-year study, no additional covariate) as
nuisance variables.
For subanalyses, we examined the correlations
between indices of the WMS-R and regional brain
volume of the voxel where cancer survivors exposed
to adjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly smaller
brain region. Regional brain volumes of the voxels
were calculated by using the region of interest (ROI)
function in the SPM2 software as a substitution for
the regional brain volume index.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the background and medical factors of
each group in both the 1-year study and the 3-year
study. Eight percent of the survivors in the 1-year
study and 8% of those in the 3-year study received
tegafur and uracil (UFT) for <80 days. Ten percent of
survivors in the 1-year study and 7% in the 3-year
study received 5 of 6 cycles of their cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil regimen, and
others completed their regimen in the 1-year study
and in the 3-year study, respectively. In other cases,
quantities of each of the administered chemotherapeutic agents complied with the protocols of each
regimen.
The peak voxel coordinates of the smaller
regions in cancer survivors exposed to adjuvant
chemotherapy compared with those unexposed using
corrected P < .05 are presented in Table 2. Figures 2

survivors exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy in the
1-year study.

DISCUSSION
The current study showed smaller right prefrontal
and parahippocampal gyrus in cancer survivors who
were exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy before the
mean of 4 months, compared with those unexposed.
These volume differences were not found in cancer
survivors at a mean of 4.2 years after completion of

their adjuvant chemotherapy. In subanalyses, the
volumes of the right superior frontal gyearus, 1 of
the smaller regions in cancer survivors exposed to
adjuvant chemotherapy, were associated with memory functions. These results indicate a potential
effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on brain structure,
and the change of the brain structure may be associated with memory function.
A previous report using VBM in 10 breast cancer
and 2 lymphoma survivors (>5 years) exposed to
chemotherapy showed smaller regional gray matter
and cortical and subcortical white matter brain

regions compared with healthy controls.10 Chemotherapeutic agents included in the previous report
were similar to those in the current study. Contrary
to results of the previous report, the results of the
current study did not show any significant difference
in regional brain volume as shown in the 3-year
study. These findings were consistent with our previous study where we used a manual tracing method,
which is a different method from the VBM, to measure regional brain volume.16 That study indicated
that there were no significantly smaller hippocampal

and amygdalar volumes among breast cancer survivors who had survived >3 years since their surgery.
This difference in results may be caused by differences in the methods, such as number and characteristics of subjects, comparisons with cancer
survivors unexposed to chemotherapy, and/or use of
corrections for multiple comparisons, as in the current study.
The current study indicated regional brain volume differences in the superior and middle frontal
gyri, parahippocampal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, and

precuneus. The significantly smaller volume of the
superior frontal gyrus in the current study was correlated with the attention/concentration and visual
memory indices of the WMS-R. The prefrontal cortex,
including superior and middle frontal gyri, has been
reported to have roles in various functions including
memory, planning, execution, monitoring of cognitive
processing and behavior, and inhibition and change
in circumstantial behavior.35 Not all, but many, of the
studies in cancer survivors exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy have reported impairments in various cognitive domains including attention/concentration and
visual memory functions.3–6 The structural differences
of the superior and middle prefrontal gyrus may
partly account for some of the previously reported
cognitive impairments and complaints referred to as
‘‘chemobrain’’. A previous positron emission tomography study of breast cancer survivors in whom the
researchers had found significant neurocognitive
changes associated with adjuvant chemotherapy,
including impairment of verbal learning, demonstrated hypometabolism in the superior frontal
gyearus. In addition to the prefrontal cortex, the parahippocampal gyrus is associated with cognitive functions, such as memory function.36 Recently, the
precuneus was also thought to have important roles
in self-centered mental imagery strategies and episodic memory retrieval,37 and these concepts lead us
to suppose the potential engagement of structural
changes in these brain regions in cognitive impairments caused by adjuvant chemotherapy.
The distribution of the regional brain volume differences observed in the 1-year study did not reappear in the 3-year study. Results from the 1-year and
3-year studies can lead us to speculate that the brain

volume change related to adjuvant chemotherapy may
well recover over the course of time. Although a previous report showed cognitive impairments in cancer
survivors even after a long period following completion of adjuvant chemotherapy,17 several longitudinal
studies18–20 and a review article4 have demonstrated
recovery from cognitive impairment in breast cancer
survivors exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy. Regional
brain structural changes and cognitive impairments
observed in cancer survivors exposed to adjuvant
chemotherapy may recover in time.
In reference comparisons between cancer survivors and healthy controls both in the 1-year study
and in the 3-year study, there were no significant differences in regional brain volume. These results support the idea that cancer had little influence on the
main analyses of the current study. We did not
include healthy controls in the primary comparisons.
We did not make a model, such as a 2-factorial
ANCOVA in which 1 factor is cancer survivors versus
healthy controls and the other factor is whether
chemotherapy was received or not, because of the
lack of any healthy controls exposed to adjuvant
chemotherapy.
The current study has several limitations. 1)
Background and medical factors were entered into
statistical models as nuisance variables, and medical
factors usually used to judge the application of adjuvant chemotherapy and factors reported as a result
of adjuvant chemotherapy were not entered to avoid
overadjustment. Given potential biases, results need
to be interpreted with caution. 2) Effects of each regimen or each chemotherapeutic agent on regional
brain volumes were unclear. 3) Pathophysiological
mechanisms of volume differences were unclear. The

Brain Volume After Adjuvant Chemotherapy/Inagaki et al.

other reason we did not explore effects of each chemotherapeutic agent in the study setting was that
interactions between each chemotherapeutic agent
may exist and may make our inference difficult. 4)
The VBM has several limitations. A method with
higher sensitivity, such as a manual tracing method
like those reported previously,16 should be used. 5)
The current study did not have any specific functional targets related to each of the detected regions.
Functions related to brain regions significantly different in volume from those in the current study need
to be examined by using specific neuropsychological
tasks and neuroimaging of brain function.
In conclusion, the current study showed significantly smaller regional brain volumes in areas related
to cognitive functions in cancer survivors who
received adjuvant chemotherapy. The smaller regional brain volumes were not observed at more
than 3 years after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Results lead to the idea that adjuvant chemotherapy could have a temporary effect on brain
structure. These findings can provide new insights
for future research to improve the quality of life of
cancer patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy.
