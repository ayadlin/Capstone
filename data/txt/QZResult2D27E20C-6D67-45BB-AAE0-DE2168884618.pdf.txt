BACKGROUND: Controversy has surrounded the role of isolated limb perfusion (ILP) for unresectable extremity sarcomas. However, there remains a group of sarcoma patients for whom amputation is the only potential treatment.
Because systemic therapies are limited, the authors evaluated ILP in an effort to provide a limb-salvage option.
METHODS: Since 1995, patients with unresectable extremity sarcomas were entered in 2 prospective trials using ILP.
Study 1 used tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and melphalan in the perfusion circuit at hyperthermic temperatures (3941 C). Study 2 used doxorubicin at normothermic temperatures. All ILPs were performed using the standard, previously described technique. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were entered into study 1; there were 10 (58%) partial
responses, 1 (6%) near complete response (CR), 1 (6%) CR, and 5 (30%) no response/minor response. Fourteen
patients died of their disease, with a median follow-up of 17 months. Seven (41%) patients maintained their limb intact
until the time of death. Twelve patients were entered into study 2; there were no partial or CRs and 2 (20%) minor
responses. With a median follow-up of 35 months, there are 3 patients alive (2 with their extremity intact and 1 with
an amputation). Six patients developed myonecrosis with creatine phosphokinase levels up to 54,000 U/dL.
CONCLUSIONS: Although doxorubicin is active systemically, TNF and melphalan appear to have greater activity and
less toxicity during ILP. Future clinical trials are needed to clearly identify the role for ILP in patients with unresectC 2011 American Cancer Society.

KEYWORDS: soft tissue sarcoma, extremity sarcoma, limb perfusion, limb salvage.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) can occur anywhere in the body, but the majority (50%) of primary tumors originate in an
extremity. Surgical resection remains the ideal primary therapy for resectable tumors. However, surgical therapy remains
problematic for patients with large primary tumors and those with bulky recurrent disease. Local recurrence rates are
directly related to the type and extent of surgical procedure performed: 90% with marginal excision, 20% to 40% with
wide local excision, and 0% to 17% with radical surgery or amputation.1-3 Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) has been used in
patients with extremity STS for >40 years.4-7 In the majority of patients, this approach has been used as a limb-sparing alternative when amputation was considered the only treatment option.8
The proposed advantages of ILP include: isolation from systemic circulation, which permits the administration of
high dosages of cytotoxic chemotherapy; tumoricidal effects from hyperthermia, which may be synergistic with chemotherapy; and potential down-staging of STS, which may permit subsequent limb-sparing surgery. Despite the long history
of using ILP for the treatment of patients with STS, several questions persist with respect to the appropriate drug or combination of drugs to be used in the perfusion circuit, the utility of hyperthermia in ILP, and the use of ILP in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.9,10 Since 1995, 2 single-arm clinical trials of ILP for unresectable extremity STS were conducted
at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The central hypothesis of both studies was that ILP for unresectable extremity STS would increase limb salvage rates. Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival. This report describes the 15-year institutional experience with ILP for advanced STS of the upper or lower
extremities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Between 1995 and January 2003, 29 patients with histologically confirmed unresectable, extremity STS were
entered into 2 consecutive, single-arm clinical trials for
ILP. The initial trial included tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-a and melphalan in the perfusion circuit and enrolled patients from 1995 to 1997. The second trial enrolled patients from 2001 to 2003, and doxorubicin was
administered as single-agent chemotherapy. Eligibility
criteria for both trials included locally advanced extremity
STS considered unresectable (ie, defined as amputation or
functionally debilitating resection) by the referring surgeon and a multidisciplinary sarcoma planning conference. Specifically, tumors were considered unresectable
secondary to either multifocal disease or fixation/invasion
of the primary neurovascular bundle and/or bone. The diagnosis was confirmed by histological re-examination of
the primary tumor specimen by a sarcoma expert pathologist. Patients with primary and recurrent sarcomas were
eligible, whereas patients with synchronous metastasis
were excluded. Patients had to be >16 years of age, with
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status of 0 or 1 and normal cardiac function. The treatment protocols were approved by the institutional review
board of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients before initiation of therapy.
ILP
Recombinant human TNF-a (TNF-a-1a) was provided
by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (Ingelheim/Rhein, Germany). Melphalan was provided by Glaxo-Wellcome
(London, UK). Under general anesthesia, the main artery
and vein of the affected limb were clamped and cannulated after heparinization. Cannulas were then connected
to a heart-lung machine, and a tourniquet was applied
proximally to prevent leakage into the general circulation.
ILP consisted of extracorporeal circulation with mild
hyperthermia (tissue temperature 38-40 C) obtained
with a heat-exchanger. When the STS was not arising in
the region of the feet or hands, they were wrapped tightly
with an Esmarch rubber bandage immediately before
injection of chemotherapy into the perfusion circuit to
prevent exposure. The first clinical trial was a phase 2
study (part of an National Cancer Institute-sponsored
multicentered trial), in which the allocated dose of TNFa according to the protocol was injected into the arterial

3236

line when the limb tissue temperature was >38&deg, C.
Thirty minutes later, 10 mg/L for the leg (lower extremity
[LE]) or 13 mg/L for the arm (upper extremity [UE]) of
melphalan per limb volume was then added for the next
60 minutes, as performed in a previous European trial.11
A washout of the limb using 3 to 4 L of dextran was performed at the end of the procedure. Leakage from the isolated perfusion circuit to the systemic compartment was
assessed with technetium 99m-radiolabeled autologous
red blood cells drawn from each patient’s systemic circulation before the operation. After injection of a small
amount of radioactivity (4 MBq) in the systemic circulation (calibration of the blood volume and efficiency of a
precordial NaI[Tl] scintillation probe), 100 MBq of
radiolabeled human serum albumin was injected into the
isolated circuit. Any increase in the precordial counting
rate (continuous curve recording) was interpreted as leakage from the isolated circuit to the systemic circulation,
and was quantified according to calibration parameters.
The second clinical trial was a phase 1 study in
which doxorubicin was initially dosed at 1.4 mg/kg for LE
and 0.7 mg/kg for UE. Because of the observation of myonecrosis and subsequent significant elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in the postoperative course of
the first 3 patients, the dosages were decreased by 25% for
the next 3 patients (1.0 mg/kg for LE and 0.5 mg/kg UE).
Clinical Follow-Up
The primary endpoint for both studies was objective tumor response (complete response [CR], partial response,
or minor response), assessed by either computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 1 and 2 months after ILP. The MRI examinations
included T1-weighted and T2-weighted fat-saturated
sequences. CR was defined by complete necrosis of the tumor or disappearance of all measurable disease. A partial
response was defined as a decrease in tumor size of >50%
in the product of the bidimensional measurements. Minor
response was defined as a decrease in tumor size of <50%
in the product of the bidimensional measurements and at
least 25% of the tumor displaying MRI characteristics
(signal intensity on T2-weighted images and homogeneity
on T1-weighted images). Progressive disease was defined
as a >25% increase in the size of the tumor or the appearance of any new lesion in the extremity or distant metastasis. Secondary endpoints included post-ILP limb-sparing
surgical resection, histological response (percent viable
cells by microscopic hematoxylin and eosin stain), grade 3
or 4 local or systemic toxicity, and survival. Systemic and

peripheral neurotoxicity was graded according to the
World Health Organization criteria scale.12 Local toxicity
was graded according to the Wieberdink scale.13
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 10 software (STATA Corporation, College Station, Tex).
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to examine PFS
and overall survival. PFS was calculated from the date of
ILP to the clinical date of tumor progression. Overall survival was calculated from the date of ILP to the date of
death from any cause. Patients were censored on their last
date of follow-up.

RESULTS
Patients
Study 1 enrolled 17 patients (11 male and 6 female) from
September 1995 to January 1997 (mean age, 54 years)
who were able to undergo successful ILP. Twelve patients
(6 male and 6 female; mean age, 52 years) were entered
into study 2 from June 2000 to February 2003; 10 underwent successful ILP. Two patients were not able to
undergo ILP secondary to difficulty in cannulating the extremity vessels and inadequate flow before attempting
ILP. The most common eligibility criteria included multifocality (33%) and joint involvement (25%) (Table 1).
There was no significant difference (P ¼ .4) between
the 2 study groups with respect to the mean size of the initial extremity STS (study 1 ¼ 8.65 cm vs study 2 ¼ 6.6
cm). Twenty-two (76%) patients had recurrent extremity
STS; 7 (24%) patients underwent ILP before any
attempted surgical resection. Of these 7 patients, 5 (17%)
were treated with either systemic chemotherapy (n ¼ 3)
or external beam radiation (n ¼ 2) before ILP. The

remaining 2 (7%) patients underwent ILP as primary
therapy for their STS. The median follow-up for all
patients was 125 months (95% confidence interval [CI],
112-138).
In study 1, there were 10 (58%) partial responses, 1
(6%) near CR, 1 (6%) CR, and 5 no response/minor
response (30%). There were no cases of postoperative
compartment syndrome and no perioperative amputations. The median PFS was 4 months (95% CI, 3.9-4.1)
(Fig. 1). Ten (59%) patients ultimately required an amputation, whereas 7 (41%) patients maintained limb function until the time of death. Fourteen (82%) patients died
of their disease (median age, 53 years), with a median
overall survival of 16.7 months (95% CI, 6.0-34.5). In
study 2, there were no partial or CRs and only 2 minor
responses. The median PFS was 2.7 months (95% CI,
0.83-4.6). Eight patients required subsequent amputation, whereas 2 patients were able to undergo post-ILP
limb-sparing radical resection of the STS.
In study 2, 7 patients developed significant post-ILP
myonecrosis with grade IV elevations of CPK levels
(range, 3310-53,590). Four patients developed grade III
neuromuscular toxicity, and 1 patient developed a grade
III CPK elevation. Because of myonecrosis observed in
the first 3 patients enrolled, the dose of doxorubicin (1.4
mg/kg for LE and 0.7 mg/kg for UE) was reduced by 25%
for the next 3 patients (1.0 mg/kg for LE and 0.5 mg/kg
for UE) (Fig. 2). Significant CPK elevations were still
observed in these patients, resulting in a second dose
reduction to 0.7 mg/kg for LE and 0.35 mg/kg for UE.
Despite this final dose reduction, CPK elevations up to
18,000 were observed, with 4 patients developing clinically evident post-ILP neuromuscular impairment. There

were no cases of compartment syndrome, and no perioperative fasciotomies or amputations were performed.
Three patients are currently alive (2 with their extremity intact and 1 with status of postamputation), with
a mean follow-up of 40.5 months. Distant metastases
developed in 23 (79%) patients, and all of these patients
are deceased from progression of disease. The most common sites of metastases included the lung, brain, bone,
and liver. The median overall survival after ILP for all
patients in both studies was 20.8 months (95% CI, 7.134.5) (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
Patients with locally advanced extremity STS present a
unique surgical challenge.14 The primary clinical dilemma is balancing optimal oncologic outcomes with
limb function. Amputation is often the only option to
achieve a margin negative (R0) resection for either large
proximal extremity (ie, thigh or calf) tumors or smaller
distal extremity (ie, dorsum of the hand) tumors. Furthermore, the proximity of STSs to joints, bone, digits, or critical neurovascular structures frequently limits the
surgeon’s ability to achieve an adequate negative resection
margin, which often results in unacceptable functional
results. Although amputations may be associated with
improved local control, the survival benefit associated
with an amputation is minimal.15,16 The goal of improving functional outcome has encouraged surgeons to search
for additional treatment options such as ILP that may ultimately prove effective.
The combination of TNF-a and melphalan has
received the most attention as potentially active agents for
use in the ILP circuit.17 A single-institution experience of
217 extremity sarcoma patients from the Netherlands
reported objective response rates up to 75%, limb salvage

rates of 87%, and median survival after ILP of 57
months.18,19 In addition to melphalan and TNF-a, interferon gamma has also been used in the ILP circuit. A
recent report detailing the Dutch experience with postILP amputation described amputations in 21 of 73 ILP
cases.20 Of these 21 patients, only 10 (14%) underwent
amputation for either local recurrence or no response to
ILP. The consensus from European centers is that ILP is
an effective option for patients with locally advanced STS.
In this report, we describe our single-institutional
results from 2 consecutive clinical trials. The first trial
used melphalan and TNF-a, because it has been associated with positive results from other centers. However,
the lack of available TNF-a in the United States necessitated the use of an alternative chemotherapeutic agent.
Because doxorubicin is commonly used in the systemic
treatment of STS and has been shown to produce STS
response rates of 15% to 35%, it was chosen to replace the
initial regimen used in study 1.21-23 The efficacy of doxorubicin as an ILP agent, however, has been questioned as a
result of conflicting literature reports.24,25 Our results
would suggest that PFS in STS patients undergoing ILP
with doxorubicin is very brief (median, 4 months). In
addition, overall survival was only 18.8 months in this
cohort, whereas other series report much higher survival
rates.26-28
Overall, our institutional experience with ILP in
patients with unresectable STS yielded unsatisfactory
results. Based upon these findings, ILP is no longer
offered to patients as a treatment option at our institution,
because effective ILP chemotherapeutic agents are lacking,
doxorubicin was not found to be effective as a single
agent, and TNF-a is currently not available in the United

States. Upon examining our data, one might question the
disparate results when compared with the European experience. There are several possible reasons to explain the
observed differences. First, our series of patients was heavily (81%) pretreated with systemic chemotherapy and/or
radiation before referral and initial consultation at The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,
whereas 74% (n ¼ 161) of patients in the report from
Grunhagen et al had received no prior therapy, and 61%
(n ¼ 132) were primary tumors. Prior exposure to systemic doxorubicin may induce chemoresistance and select
for a subpopulation of doxorubicin-resistant tumor
cells.29 This current practice pattern and referral system
may naturally select for resistant and biologically aggressive STSs, such as those evaluated at our institution. At
first glance, comparing our patients and their outcomes to
those treated at European centers may not appear equivalent. However, upon further examination of Grunhagen’s
data, 39% (n ¼ 85) of patients were reported to have
undergone ILP for recurrent STS. In the authors’ univariate analysis, ‘‘ILP for recurrent disease’’ and ‘‘previous
XRT’’ were independent predictor variables associated
with local recurrence (P ¼ .009 and P ¼ .011, respectively). Therefore, the Dutch subset of patients with recurrent STS may be more comparable to those treated at our
institution.
Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guidelines30 state that amputation for extremity STS
should be considered when it is the patient’s preference or
if the tumor has 1 or more of the following characteristics:
Extensive soft tissue mass and/or skin involvement,
Involvement of a major artery or nerve,
Extensive bony involvement that requires whole
bone resection,
Failure of preoperative therapy, or
Recurrence after prior adjuvant radiation.
Two historical studies highlight the clinical challenge for the sarcoma surgeon. The first study, by Baldini
et al, demonstrated local recurrence rates of 13% when a
resection margin of <1.0 cm was achieved as compared
with 0% when the resection margin was >1.0 cm.31 The
second report, from Lin et al, demonstrated that radical
amputation as the initial treatment of an STS did not
decrease the probability of metastasis and did not improve
disease-free survival.32 Although both publications are
single-institution, retrospective series, the results suggest
amputation should be reserved only for cases where resection or re-resection with adequate margins cannot be performed without sacrificing functional outcome.

Based upon the results of trials performed in
Europe, one could potentially argue that ILP with combination TNF and melphalan should be considered as firstline therapy for patients presenting with large, high-grade,
primary STS. However, this controversial treatment
would undoubtedly need to be studied in a true randomized control trial (neoadjuvant ILP þ surgery vs surgery
alone). If one were to design this clinical trial with the primary outcome measure to include a decrease in local recurrence from 26% (based upon the Dutch experience) to
21%, a conservative size of treatment effect would be an
absolute difference of 5% and a relative reduction of 20%.
A standard clinical trial design would require 1133
patients in each group (with an alpha of.05 and a power of
0.80).33 Because this is a relatively rare condition, the
numbers required for such a clinical trial would likely necessitate an alternative design strategy, such as a Bayesian
adaptive trial design.34,35
It is important to note other institutions’ experience
with isolated limb infusion for unresectable STS.9,36-40
This technique has been studied and used primarily for
extremity in-transit melanoma and differs in a few important features. For isolated limb infusion, interventional radiology-directed catheters are inserted percutaneously
into the major artery and vein of the contralateral limb. A
pneumatic tourniquet is inflated proximally around the
affected limb, and the cytotoxic agent (melphalan, actinomycin D, and/or mitomycin C) is infused via the arterial
catheter and circulated through the extremity, and exits
the limb via the venous catheter. The isolated limb infusion circuit is connected to a cardiopulmonary bypass
exchanger for the purpose of heating the infusate without
providing oxygenation. This is a fundamental difference
between ILP and isolated limb infusion. For isolated limb
infusion procedures, the combination of cytotoxic agent,
hyperthermia, hypoxia, and acidosis is believed to contribute to the tumoricidal effect. This technique has been
used by select centers with encouraging results, with
response rates (complete or partial) up to 70%.
There are several important limitations of this study.
The results presented are from 2 single-institution phase 2
trials that comprise a nonrandomized case series. Because
there is no control group, comparison can only be made
to historical data. Small research studies may overestimate
the true treatment effect (ILP in this example) and are
prone to wide 95% CIs. In addition, small sample sizes
are associated with additional statistical limitations.
When examining risk factors or other associations, it is
usually necessary to allow for the effect of independent

3239

variables, prognostic factors, and possible confounding
variables. These analyses are performed using regression
models (linear, logistic, or Cox proportional hazards).
However, when the number of observations is small,
adjusting for factors often fails to yield reliable results.
Patients who present to our center with borderline
or unresectable STS are currently offered a multimodality
combination therapy that consists of systemic chemotherapy, external beam or brachytherapy, and limb-sparing
surgical resection.41,42 Currently, brachytherapy is used as
the primary mode of radiation delivery in the recurrent
setting, as it allows for the delivery of high doses of radiation to limited tissue volumes.43 Fortunately, the overall
number of patients who present to The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with unresectable extremity STS is small.
Based upon National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, ILP or isolated limb infusion for STS
should be considered ‘‘experimental therapy’’ and only be
performed in the context of an investigative study or clinical trial. Recent promising results with isolated limb infusion warrant further investigation into this modality to
demonstrate clinical benefit and utility. Recurrent or
bulky extremity STSs remain a difficult clinical challenge,
and renewed interest in neoadjuvant strategies (ie, isolated
limb infusion) may improve limb salvage. It is possible
that in the near future novel chemotherapeutic or pathway-specific targeted agents may be more effective and
could improve upon the results that we report in this
study.
