Elevation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases by Small Molecule
AKT Inhibitors in Prostate Cancer Is Mediated by Pim-1

Abstract
The PI3K/AKT pathway is hyperactivated in prostate cancer but its effective therapeutic targeting has proven
difﬁcult. In particular, the antitumor activity of AKT inhibitors is attenuated by upregulation of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK) through an uncharacterized feedback mechanism. In this report, we show that RNA interferencemediated silencing or pharmacologic inhibition of Pim-1 activity curtails AKT inhibitor-induced upregulation of
RTKs in prostate cancer cells. Although Pim kinases have been implicated in cap-dependent translational control,
we ﬁnd that in the context of AKT inhibition, the expression of RTKs is controlled by Pim-1 in a cap-independent
manner by controlling internal ribosome entry. Combination of Pim and AKT inhibitors resulted in synergistic
inhibition of prostate tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Together, our results show that Pim-1 mediates resistance
to AKT inhibition and suggest its targeting to improve the efﬁcacy of AKT inhibitors in anticancer therapy. Cancer

Introduction
The PI3K/AKT pathway is commonly activated in human
cancer and controls cellular processes that contribute to the
initiation and maintenance of cancer (1). It is activated in 40%
of primary and 70% of metastatic prostate cancers secondary
to mutations or deletions in PTEN (1–3). Activation of the
pathway can be associated with mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit P110 a and regulatory subunit (1), mutations in each of the 3 AKT isoforms (1, 4),
and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) by mutation
(e.g., EGF receptor; EGFR) or gene ampliﬁcation (e.g., HER2),
which can result in activation of downstream PI3K/AKT (1, 5).
Multiple small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to
target PI3K/mTOR or AKT (6), but the efﬁcacy of these drugs is
compromised by the stimulation of compensatory signaling
pathways that have the potential to enhance tumor growth (7–
9). There is accumulating evidence that inhibition of the PI3K/
AKT pathway can lead to adaptive resistance due to upregulation and activation of RTKs (7–9). The mechanism underlying
the AKT inhibition-induced upregulation of some of these
RTKs, including HER3, INSR, and insulin-like growth factor1 receptor (IGF-IR), has been shown to, in part, involve FOXO
transcription factors (7); however, these transcription factors
do not seem to be involved in the AKT inhibition-induced
upregulation of other RTKs, including MET, HER2, and RET (7).

The Pim family of serine/threonine kinases regulates cell
survival pathways and has been implicated in the progression
of several human cancers, including prostate cancer (10).
Clinically, the expression of the Pim kinases is elevated in
human prostate cancer (10), in which the PI3K/AKT pathway is
activated, and the levels of Pim correlate with survival of
patients with certain subtypes of human lymphoma (11),
suggesting that the Pim kinases could play an important role
in regulating tumor growth and, potentially, patient survival.
As the Pim kinases have overlapping activity with AKT with
both regulating apoptosis, cell-cycle progression, and cellular
metabolism (12–13), and AKT and the Pim kinases share
substrates in common (12–13), it has been suggested that Pim
could play an important role in the activation of AKT (14).
Reciprocal regulation of AKT and Pim-1 levels is suggested by
the report that forced expression of nuclear-targeted AKT
induces Pim-1 and either expression of a dominant-negative
Pim-1 or genetic deletion of the enzyme increased AKT
expression and phospho-AKT levels in cardiomyocytes (14).
Here, we show that inhibition of AKT leads to transcriptional induction of the Pim-1 protein kinase, and in turn, Pim-1
regulates the expression of RTKs. The anticancer activity
of small-molecule AKT and Pim kinase inhibitors has been
investigated.

cells as template with the following 2 primers: 50 -ATACTAGTGCTGCAGCGGCCGCGGTGGCTGA-30 and 50 -AACCATGGCCCAACCTCCAGGATGTCGGCGCA-30 . The PCR product
was sequenced and cloned into the EcoRI and NcoI sites of the
plasmid of pRF to create pR-MET-F.
Immunoblotting
Cells were harvested in lysis buffer A consisting of
50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40, and
5 mmol/L EDTA. Protein concentrations were determined
by DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad).
Cell culture and transfections
Cell lines were grown in RPMI (PC3-LN4, DU145, 22RV1,
VCAP, and BT474) or Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
[HeLa, mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts (MEF)] in 5% CO2. DU145,
22RV1, VCAP, BT474, and HeLa cells were supplied by American Type Culture Collection and passaged in our laboratory
for less than 6 months after receipt. PC3-LN4 cells were
described before (16). The MEFs, which were triple knockout
(TKO) for all Pim genes, were previously described (17). Cells
were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according
to manufacturer's instructions.
Real-time PCR analyses
SYBR Green reactions were done using a BioRad iQ5 quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) system. For data analysis,
raw counts were normalized to the housekeeping gene averaged for the same timepoint and condition (DCt). Counts are
reported as fold change relative to the untreated control
(2DDCt). All primers were designed and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Primers are listed in the Supplementary Data.
Luciferase assays
Fireﬂy luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer (Model TD 20/20; Turner Designs)
using the reagents provided with the Dual Luciferase Reporter
kit (Promega).
Soft-agar colony formation assays
The soft-agar assay was conducted on 6-well plates in
duplicate. For each well, 5,000 cells were mixed in growth
medium containing 0.7% agarose and GSK690693 or SMI-4a.
Cells were then layered over 1% agarose in regular medium.
Medium containing GSK690693 or SMI-4a was added to each
well every 4 days. The assays were terminated after 21 days, and
colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted under a
microscope.
Cell proliferation measurement
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 3,000 cells per well in
100 mL of 10% FBS-containing medium. After 24-hour incubation, the medium was replaced with 0.2% FBS medium with
GSK690693, SMI-4a, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 72
hours. Cell viability was measured using a MTT assay. The
absorbance was read at 590 nm with a reference ﬁlter of
620 nm.

In vitro transcription and RNA transfection
The mRNAs were puriﬁed with MEGA Clear Kit (Ambion),
quantiﬁed spectrophotometrically, and their qualities were
veriﬁed on a denaturing agarose gel. RNA transfection was
conducted with TransIT-mRNA Transfection Kit (Mirus)
according to the manufacturer's suggestion. An aliquot of 1
mg of capped mRNAs and 2 mL of TransIT-mRNA reagent
together with 1 mL of mRNA boost reagent was used to
transfect 80% conﬂuent cells grown in 12-well plates. At 16
hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed for
luciferase assay.
Animal experiments
Four- to six-week-old nu/nu nude male mice were obtained
from Charles River Laboratories and maintained in pressurized
ventilated caging. All studies were conducted in compliance
with Institutional guidelines under an Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee-approved protocol (MUSC#3081).
For efﬁcacy studies, mice with well-established tumors were
selected and randomized 14 days after implantation (size > 150
mm3); PC3-LN4 xenograft tumors were established in nude
mice by subcutaneously injecting 5  106 cells suspended in
PBS into the right ﬂank. Mice were treated with vehicle,
GSK690693, or SMI-4a, or GSK690693 þ SMI-4a at the indicated doses. GSK690693 was dissolved in 30% propylene glycol,
5% Tween-80, 65% of 5% dextrose in water (pH4–5), and
administered intraperitoneally daily, whereas SMI-4a was dissolved in the same solvent and administered by oral gavage
twice daily. Tumor dimensions were measured with a caliper
and tumor volumes were calculated [tumor volume (mm3) ¼
(length  width2)/2].
Statistical analysis
The results of quantitative studies are reported as mean 
SD or mean  SEM (for animal experiments). Differences were
analyzed by Student t test. P < 0.05 was regarded as signiﬁcant.

Results
AKT inhibition induces Pim-1 expression in prostate
cancer cells
Treatment of the prostate cancer PC3-LN4 cells with the
pan-AKT inhibitor GSK690693 markedly increased the levels of
Pim-1 protein in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion
(Fig. 1A and B) but had a minimal effect on the expression of
Pim-3 protein and reduced the levels of Pim-2 (Fig. 1C). Similar
results were obtained using another AKT inhibitor, MK2206,
and a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor, BEZ235 (Fig. 1C). The
induction of Pim-1 was also observed with GSK690693 treatment of human prostate cancer cell lines DU145, 22RV1, and
VCAP (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The effect of GSK690693 on
Pim-1 was not secondary to an off-target effect as knockdown
in PC3-LN4 cells of all 3 AKTs with siRNAs increased the levels
of Pim-1 protein (Fig. 1D). Treatment of PC3-LN4 cells with
GSK690693 or MK2206 resulted in elevations in the level of
Pim-1 mRNA, but not Pim-2 or Pim-3 (Fig. 1E). Similarly,
treatment of PC3-LN4 cells with siRNAs directed at AKT1,
AKT2, and AKT3 also resulted in the elevation of Pim-1 mRNA

Figure 1. AKT inhibition induces expression of Pim-1. PC3-LN4 cells were treated with 5 mmol/L GSK690693 (A) for the times indicated, increasing doses of
GSK690693 (B) as indicated for 24 hours, 5 mmol/L GSK690693, 2 mmol/L MK2206, or 0.5 mmol/L BEZ235 (C) for 24 hours, and siRNAs against AKT1,

(Fig. 1F). To further determine whether GSK690693 regulates
the transcription of the Pim-1 gene, a 3.0 kb promoter fragment
of the Pim-1 promoter was cloned upstream of a luciferase
reporter. Addition of GSK690693 increased the activity of this
promoter in PC3-LN4 cells (Fig. 1G).
Upregulation of Pim-1 is required for AKT inhibitorassociated induction of RTKs
Consistent with previous reports of upregulation of these
RTKs in response to AKT inhibition (7), treatment of PC3-LN4
cells with GSK690693 increased the protein levels of multiple
RTKs, including MET, EPHA2, RON, EGFR, HER2, HER3, INSR,
and IGF-IR (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In addition, we observed
increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation resulting from treatment with GSK690693 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). This is in keeping with previous ﬁnding
that PI3K inhibition leads to mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway activation (18–19).
GSK690693 also completely blocked the phosphorylation of
2 well-known AKT substrates, GSK3b and PRAS40, showing
the effectiveness of this compound (Supplementary Fig. S1C)
and caused the paradoxical hyperphosphorylation of AKT at
its 2 regulatory sites (Thr308 and Ser473; Supplementary

Fig. S1C), a common property of ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors (20).
To determine whether Pim-1 plays an important regulatory
role in the ability of AKT inhibitors to modulate RTKs, we ﬁrst
determined the effects of Pim-directed siRNAs and smallmolecule inhibitors. The use of siRNA directed at Pim-1
showed that a forced reduction in Pim-1 levels markedly
reduced the ability of GSK690693 to elevate the protein levels
of multiple RTKs, including MET and EPHA2, HER3, HER2,
INSR, and IGF-IR, as well as the phosphorylation of ERK (Fig.
2A). The addition of SMI-4a, a small-molecule Pim kinase
inhibitor (21), reduced GSK690693-induced upregulation of
RTK protein levels in PC3-LN4 (Fig. 2B), DU145, 22RV1, and
VCAP cells (Supplementary Fig. S2)
The results of phospho-RTK antibody array (reverse-phase
protein array; RPPA) analysis revealed that treatment of PC3LN4 cells with GSK690693 increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of RTKs tested in the assay, that is, MET,
EPHA2, HER2, INSR, and EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S3). The
lack of complete correlation in these assays may arise from the
differing speciﬁcity of the antibodies used in the RPPA analysis.
This change in RTK phosphorylation is consistent with the
AKT inhibitor-induced increases in the protein levels of the

Pim-1 Regulates Expression of RTKs

Figure 2. Pim-1 is required for elevated expression of RTKs induced by AKT inhibition. Immunoblot analyses were carried out with the indicated
antibodies in PC3-LN4 cells that were treated with 2 different siRNAs (1 and 2) against Pim-1 as well as a nontargeting control siRNA (2 left lanes) for 48 hours
followed by the addition of GSK690693 (5 mmol/L) for an additional 24 hours (A). B, PC3-LN4 cells were treated with GSK690693 (GSK, 5 mmol/L) or SMI-4a
(4a, 10 mmol/L) or the combination of the 2 compounds for 24 hours. C–E, wild-type (WT; C), Pim kinase TKO murine embryonic ﬁbroblast cells were
treated with 5 mmol/L GSK690693 for 24 hours; PC3-LN4 cells were treated with 3 different Pim inhibitors, SMI-4a (4a, 10 mmol/L), SMI-16a (16a, 10 mmol/L), or
K00135 (K, 5 mmol/L) for 24 hours (D); PC3-LN4 cells were transfected with a nontargeting control siRNA, siRNA against Pim-1, an empty vector, or a
Pim-1–expressing plasmid for 72 hours (E).

RTKs; however, it cannot be ruled out that GSK690693 stimulates RTK phosphorylation through an alternative mechanism
(7). Treatment with SMI-4a blocked the GSK690693-induced
RTK phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S3), showing that
the inhibition of Pim reverses the activity of this AKT inhibitor.
To further evaluate the role of Pim-1 in regulating AKT
inhibitor-induced upregulation of RTKs, MEFs were treated
with GSK690693. In wild-type cells, but not in the Pim kinasedeﬁcient (TKO) cells, GSK690693 treatment of the cells
increased the levels of the RTKs tested, that is, MET, HER3,
IGF-IR, and EPHA2 protein, as well as the phosphorylation of
ERK (Fig. 2C). We treated PC3-LN4 (Fig. 2D) and VCAP
(Supplementary Fig. S4) cells with 3 different Pim kinase
inhibitors, SMI-4a, SMI-16a (21), and K00135 (22), to test
whether Pim-1 activity affects the baseline level of RTK proteins in tumor cells. Treatment decreased the protein levels of
the RTKs, for example, MET, EPHA2, and HER3, in both cell
lines. Similarly, siRNA targeting of Pim-1 decreased the levels of

www.aacrjournals.org

MET, HER3, HER2, and EGFR protein in PC3-LN4 cells (Fig. 2E).
Conversely, overexpression of human Pim-1 in PC3-LN4
increased the levels of the RTKs, MET, HER3, EPHA2, HER2,
and EGFR (Fig. 2E).
AKT inhibition increases cap-independent translation
AKT protein kinase activity controls protein synthesis by
regulating the multistep process of mRNA translation at
multiple stages from ribosome biogenesis to translation initiation and elongation (23). Although GSK690693 treatment of
prostate cancer cells did not modify phosphorylation of 4EBP1, this compound increased phosphorylation of eIF2a and
eliminated phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (Fig. 3A).
To further deﬁne the role of cap-dependent translation in the
mechanism of action of this agent, GSK690693 was combined
with 2 potent inhibitors of mTOR complex (mTORC)-1/
mTORC2 and thus cap-dependent translation, PP242 and
AZD8055 (24–25). These inhibitors in combination with

GSK690693 resulted in reduced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and
increased eIF2a phosphorylation compared with GSK690693
alone (Fig. 3A), suggesting inhibition of 50 -cap–dependent
translation. We measured the binding of eIF4G and 4E-BP1
to the 50 mRNA cap by using m7GTP-sepharose. The structure
of these beads mimics the 50 mRNA cap and precipitates capinteracting proteins. In agreement with the effect on phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, PP242, or AZD8055 in combination with
GSK690693 strongly reduced eIF4G and increased 4E-BP1,
binding to m7GTP-sepharose, whereas GSK690693 alone did
not have a signiﬁcant effect (Supplementary Fig. S5A). However, the treatment of prostate cancer cells with these mTORC1
inhibitors did not reduce the GSK690693-induced elevation of
MET, EPHA2, HER3, and IGF-IR (Fig. 3A). A recent study (26)
using Torin 1, an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, showed
that Torin 1-resistant mRNAs are enriched for RTKs such as
MET, IGF-IR, and INSR, indicating that the translation initiation of these mRNAs do not depend on mTOR activity (27). We
found that treatment of PC3-LN4 cells with PP242 or AZD8055
indeed did not inhibit the expression of MET, EPHA2, HER3,
IGF1R, or INSR (Supplementary Fig. S5B). In addition, the
expression of Bcl-2 whose translation under cellular stress
(28) has been shown to be controlled by a cap-independent
mechanism was not suppressed by treatment with mTOR
inhibitors, whereas proteins known to be sensitive to mTOR
inhibiton, YB-1, HSP90, RPS7 (26, 29), were reduced (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Reduced eIF4G and increased 4EBP1 binding to m7GTP-sepharose, and increased eIF2a phosphoryla-

tion (Supplementary Fig. S5C) conﬁrmed that cap-dependent
translation was efﬁciently inhibited. Together these data suggest that upregulation of RTKs is not controlled by capdependent mechanisms.
Under conditions of decreased cap-dependent translation,
the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation
can play a larger role in regulating protein synthesis (30).
Recently, it has been shown that inhibition of PI3K/mTOR
leads to increased IRES-mediated translation (8). Inhibition of
AKT by GSK690693 resulted in increased IRES activity measured by ratio of ﬁreﬂy to Renilla luciferase activities in
constructs containing either cellular [hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF1a), Myc, and VEGF; ref. 31] or viral [cricket
paralysis virus (CrPV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV); ref. 32]
IRES sequences (Fig. 3B). In agreement with these ﬁndings,
GSK690693 induced expression of Bcl-2, Myc, VEGF, and
HIF1a, all of which can be translated in a cap-independent
manner under cellular stress (28, 31, 33–34), further suggesting
the possibility that cap-independent translation is upregulated
(Fig. 3C).
Pim-1 regulates RTK expression through capindependent translation
Expression of human Pim-1 in PC3-LN4 cells did not affect
the levels of RTK mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S6A and B) or the
half life of the RTKs (Supplementary Fig. S6C), suggesting that
Pim-1 may control the levels of these proteins through a
translational mechanism. Plus, GSK690693 increased cap-

Pim-1 Regulates Expression of RTKs

independent translation (Fig. 3). Taken together, we speculated that the upregulation of the RTKs induced by AKT inhibitors
could be controlled, at least in part, by a cap-independent
mechanism. We ﬁrst determined whether the MET 50 -UTR
contains an IRES that could be stimulated by either GSK690693
or Pim-1. The MET 50 -UTR is relatively long (408 nt) and is
guanine-cytosine (GC)-rich (15), which are 2 common properties of IRES-containing 50 -UTRs. The 50 -UTR of MET was cloned and inserted in front of ﬁreﬂy luciferase in the dicistronic
vector pRF (35). The presence of the MET 50 -UTR sequence
increased the expression of downstream ﬁreﬂy luciferase
relative to Renilla by 38-fold compared with the vector control
(Fig. 4A), suggesting that it could function as an IRES. In
comparison, the IRESs of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV),
HIF1a, and VEGF produced 18-, 9-, and 13-fold increases,
respectively. In PC3-LN4 cells transfected with the pRF vector
containing the MET IRES, overexpression of Pim-1 or treatment of GSK690693 resulted in an increase in ratio of ﬁreﬂy to
Renilla luciferase activities as compared with control treatment (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of Pim-1 suppressed GSK690603induced MET IRES activities (Supplementary Fig. S7). Collectively, these results indicated that Pim-1 can potentially regulate translation of MET in a cap-independent fashion.

To determine whether the MET 50 -UTR is sufﬁcient to drive
translation by acting as an IRES and to rule out the possibility
of a cryptic promoter in the 50 -UTR of MET, we in vitro
transcribed the pRF vector containing the MET IRES yielding
a capped dicistronic mRNA, and then transfected this mRNA
directly into PC3-LN4 cells. Insertion of the MET or VEGF 50 UTR resulted in a 7- or 5-fold increase in the ﬁreﬂy/Renilla
ratio, respectively. In comparison, when the pRF vector containing the viral EMCV IRES was transcribed and transduced
into these cells, the ﬁreﬂy/Renilla ratio increased by 114-fold
(Fig. 4B). Thus, in comparison with a viral IRES, both the MET
and VEGF sequences have relatively weak IRES activities.
Besides MET, other RTKs including IGF-IR have been reported
to have IRES elements in their 50 -UTRs (36). As shown in Fig.
4C, the IRES activity of the 50 -UTR of IGF-IR was increased on
treatment of the cells with GSK690693 or Pim-1 overexpression
and, conversely, was decreased on knockdown of endogenous
Pim-1 protein levels. Furthermore, knockdown of Pim-1 suppressed GSK690603-induced IGF-IR IRES activities (Supplementary Fig. S7). It is possible that this mechanism is important for the control of other RTKs because in general these
genes have long 50 -UTRs. In addition, knockdown of Pim-1 in
PC3-LN4 cells led to a reduction of IRES activities of viral, CrPV

and HCV, and cellular, HIF1a and Myc, IRESs (Fig. 4D). These
data suggest that Pim-1 could be a more general regulator of
IRES-mediated translation. This concept is further supported
by our ﬁnding that the upregulation of proteins whose
translation can be controlled by an IRES-mediated mechanism under cellular stress, Bcl-2, Myc, VEGF, and HIF1a, is
stimulated by GSK690693 and requires Pim-1 expression
(Fig. 4E).
Ribosomal stress abrogates AKT inhibition-induced
upregulation of RTK expression
Pim-1 has been shown to physically interact with ribosomal
protein S19 and to cosediment with ribosomes (37–38).
Knockdown of ribosomal protein S19 or S6 abolished upregulation of MET, EPHA2, HER3, and IGF-IR induced by
GSK690693 without affecting Pim-1 induction (Fig. 5A). Consistent with ﬁndings from other laboratories (38–40), reduced
protein expression of ribosomal protein S6 was seen when S19
was decreased by siRNA and vice versa (Fig. 5A). To test the
effect of ribosomal stress on RTK upregulation independent of
ribosomal protein knockdowns, low concentrations of actinomycin D (ActD) were used to inhibit RNA polymerase I, and
thus induce ribosomal stress (41–42). Similar to S19 and S6
knockdowns, ActD treatment blocked upregulation of MET,
EPHA2, HER3, and IGF-IR induced by GSK690693 (Fig. 5B).
ActD treatment also inhibited upregulation of MET, EPHA2,
and HER3 resulting from direct Pim-1 overexpression in PC3LN4 cells (Fig. 5C). Ribosomal stress did not seem to affect
global translation as the expression of Src and ERK1/2 proteins was not altered (Fig. 5A and B). These data suggest that
Pim-1 may work through intact ribosomes to control RTK
expression.

Combination treatment with an AKT and a Pim inhibitor
synergistically blocks prostate tumor growth in vitro and
in vivo
As a preliminary test of whether combined inhibition of AKT
and Pim kinases might provide synergistic antitumor efﬁcacy,
we tested the effects of the inhibitors on the proliferation of
PC3-LN4 cells in vitro. Treatment of PC3-LN4 cells with the Pim
inhibitor SMI-4a in combination with the AKT inhibitor
GSK690693 resulted in a synergistic enhancement of the
inhibition of proliferation as shown by combination index of
less than 0.5 (Fig. 6A; data not shown), and a markedly greater
reduction in both the numbers and the size of colonies seen in a
soft-agar colony formation assay (Fig. 6B). GSK690693 and
SMI-4a blocked the proliferation of DU145 in a similar fashion
(Supplementary Fig. S8).
To test the activity of these agents in vivo, PC3-LN4 cells were
injected into mice and treated with GSK690693 alone, SMI-4a
alone, or both drugs in combination on a daily basis for 21 days
starting at 15 days after tumor implantation. When used alone,
treatment of these drugs caused a modest inhibition of tumor
growth, whereas the combined treatment resulted in a
markedly greater inhibition of tumor growth (Fig. 6C). As
shown in Fig. 6D, immunoblot analysis of lysates of tumors
harvested at the termination of the experiment on day 36 had
upregulated the levels of MET, EPHA2, and HER3 protein in
mice treated with GSK690693 as compared with the tumors
from mice treated with vehicle (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, the
levels of Pim-1 were increased in the combined therapy, and
could suggest an in vivo interaction between these agents
cannot be ruled out. This upregulation of the RTKs was
signiﬁcantly reduced in the tumors from mice treated with
a combination of GSK690693 and SMI-4a (Fig. 6D).

Figure 5. Ribosomal stress abrogates RTK upregulation induced by GSK690693. A, PC3-LN4 cells were treated for 48 hours with siRNAs against
Pim-1, ribosomal protein S19, S6 as well as a nontargeting control siRNA (2 left lanes) followed by adding GSK690693 (5 mmol/L) for an additional 24 hours.
B, PC3-LN4 cells were treated with increasing dose of ActD with and without 5 mmol/L GSK690693 for 24 hours. C, PC3-LN4 cells were transfected with a
Pim-1–expressing plasmid or a control vector. ActD (5 nmol/L) was added 24 hours after transfection for an additional 16 hours. Whole-cell lysates
were subjected to immunoblot analyses with the indicated antibodies.

Pim-1 Regulates Expression of RTKs

Figure 6. Combined inhibition of AKT and Pim shows synergistic antitumor activity. A, PC3-LN4 cells were treated with increasing doses of GSK690693 and
SMI-4a (4a) as indicated in media containing 0.2% serum for 72 hours followed by a MTT assay. Similar results were obtained from 3 independent
experiments. One representative experiment is shown. B, PC3-LN4 cells were plated in 10% serum and 0.7% agarose-containing medium with
10 mmol/L of GSK690693 or SMI-4a alone or in combination. Colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted after 21 days and the data are mean  SD of
3 independent experiments. Bar, 200 micrometer. C, Nu/Nu mice bearing PC3-LN4 tumors were randomized into 4 groups: vehicle, GSK690693
(30 mg/kg i.p. daily), SMI-4a (60 mg/kg oral twice/day), and the combination. Tumor size was measured every 3 days. The results are presented as the mean
tumor volume  SEM (n ¼ 6 mice/group).   , P < 0.02 for the GSK þ SMI-4a group versus all other treatment groups. D, immunoblot analyses of
tumors in C with the indicated antibodies. Tumors were harvested on day 36, 6 hours after the last dose of therapy. The numbers above each lane represent
individual tumors in that treatment group. E, a model for the feedback upregulation of RTK expression mediated by Pim-1 kinase.

Discussion
The results of these experiments provide insights into the
mechanisms underlying the compensatory interplay between
AKT and Pim-1 in the regulation of prostate cancer cell
behavior inﬂuenced by the expression of RTKs. They suggest
a model in which reduction in AKT activity is associated with
an increase in the levels of Pim-1 protein kinase that occurs
through a transcriptional mechanism. This increase in Pim-1
kinase is associated, in turn, with promotion of the expression
of RTKs through a cap-independent mechanism. Downregulation of Pim-1 blocks the feedback elevation in RTKs associated
with inhibition of AKT (Fig. 6E). Likewise inhibitors of Pim
synergize with small-molecule AKT inhibitors to block the
growth of prostate cancer cells.
The control of Pim-1 protein levels is complex and has been
shown to involve the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and

www.aacrjournals.org

translational mechanisms (43). In the current study, we show
that inhibition of AKT can increase the levels of Pim-1 through
a transcriptional mechanism; however, it is possible that
additional alternative mechanisms could also play a role in
increasing Pim-1 protein levels. The induction of Pim-1 by AKT
inhibition coincides with suppression of total protein synthesis
(Supplementary Fig. S9) and is not inhibited by further treatment with mTORC inhibitors (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Pim-1
protein levels could also be regulated in a cap-independent
manner. The Pim-1 50 -UTR may contain an IRES that could also
be regulated by speciﬁc cellular growth conditions (44),
although the existence of this IRES is controversial (45).
It has been shown previously that inhibition of AKT regulates the transcription of RTKs by modulating the activity of
Foxo transcription factors (7); however, in the same study no
change was seen in the level of HER2, RET, or MET mRNAs,

suggesting that the levels of speciﬁc RTKs might be controlled
by other mechanisms. Cap-dependent translation plays a role
in both PI3K/AKT and Pim-2 enhancement of the synthesis of
speciﬁc proteins (46). It should be noted, however, that molecules that blocked mTORC1 activity could not inhibit the Pim-2
protein kinase and an agent that blocked eIF4A function,
which is known to take part in IRES mediated translation,
was required. In addition, small-molecule mTORC inhibitors
can decrease the translation of many mRNAs, for example, 50 terminal oligopyrimidine tracts mRNAs, while increasing the
level of translation of RTKs (26), again suggesting that these
RTK mRNAs may be translated in a cap-independent fashion.
Moreover, further inhibition of cap-dependent translation with
the mTORC1/2 inhibitors, PP242 and AZD8055, had no effect
on the ability of GSK690693 or Pim-1 to induce RTKs (Fig. 3A),
suggesting that in the experimental conditions used in these
studies, the mechanism by which this agent controls RTK levels
is not cap dependent.
Our results are consistent with the hypothesis put forward
by Muranen and colleagues that inhibition of PI3K/mTOR
could lead to enhanced cap-independent translation (8). Cloning of the Met 50 -UTR into a dicistronic luciferase vector
showed that it can function as an IRES element, although
weakly in comparison with viral sequences, and its activity is
enhanced by GSK690693 and Pim-1 overexpression (Fig. 4A
and B). Further supporting evidence of the ability of
GSK690693 and Pim-1 to regulate the activity of the IRES is
the observation that the IGF-IR IRES (47) is stimulated by these
agents and that Pim-1 knockdown decreases the activity of this
element (Fig. 4C). Our data further suggest that Pim-1 may be
essential for full IRES activity of additional viral and cellular
IRES elements, including HCV, CrPV, HIF1a, and Myc (Fig. 4D),
suggesting a general role of Pim in the control of cap-independent translation.
It has been suggested previously that because they are both
survival kinases, AKT and Pim protein kinases could be important pharmacologic targets to inhibit tumor growth (12). Our
experiments show a high degree of synergism between smallmolecule inhibitors of AKT and Pim in their ability to kill

prostate cancer cells both in tissue culture and in a xenograft
model (Fig. 6). Analysis of the tumors from treated animals
showed that AKT inhibitor treatment elevates RTKs in the
tumor cells grown in vivo and that simultaneous treatment
with a Pim inhibitor downregulates this effect (Fig. 6D).
Because both these kinase pathways are highly activated in
human prostate cancer, dual inhibitor treatment of these
tumors could be a particularly attractive chemotherapeutic
strategy.
