Abstract
The treatment options remain limited for patients with melanoma who are wild-type for both BRAF and NRAS (WT/WT). We
demonstrate that a subgroup of WT/WT melanomas display high
basal phosphorylation of ErbB3 that is associated with autocrine
production of the ErbB3 ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). In WT/WT
melanoma cells displaying high levels of phospho-ErbB3, knockdown of NRG1 reduced cell viability and was associated with
decreased phosphorylation of ErbB3, its coreceptor ErbB2, and its
downstream target, AKT. Similar effects were observed by targeting ErbB3 with either siRNAs or the neutralizing ErbB3 mono-

clonal antibodies huHER3-8 and NG33. In addition, pertuzumab-mediated inhibition of ErbB2 heterodimerization decreased
AKT phosphorylation, cell growth in vitro, and xenograft growth in
vivo. Pertuzumab also potentiated the effects of MEK inhibitor on
WT/WT melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo. These ﬁndings
demonstrate that targeting ErbB3–ErbB2 signaling in a cohort of
WT/WT melanomas leads to tumor growth reduction. Together,
these studies support the rationale to target the NRG1–ErbB3–
ErbB2 axis as a novel treatment strategy in a subset of cutaneous
melanomas. Cancer Res; 75(17); 3554–67. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

BRAF tumors make up approximately 50% of cutaneous melanomas, distinct subsets harbor NRAS mutations (15%) or
are wild-type for both BRAF and NRAS (WT/WT; 35%). In
non-V600E BRAF melanoma, there is lack of effective targeted
therapy options. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors,
which act in a genotype-independent manner, have recently
gained FDA approval (5, 6), additional therapeutic treatment
options are needed. Studies have sought to identify other driver
mutations in addition to the known alterations in BRAF and
NRAS (7, 8) especially given that melanomas derived from sunexposed regions that are WT/WT exhibit high mutation counts
and UV damage signatures (8, 9). Somatic mutations in the KIT,
NF1, and NOTCH1 genes have been identiﬁed in WT/WT
melanomas but non-mutational alterations are also likely to
be important (7, 8, 10).
ErbB3–HER3 (v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene
homolog 3/human epidermal receptor 3) is a member of the EGF
family of cell-surface receptors. Compared with the other members (EGFR/ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB4), ErbB3 exhibits low kinase
activity but remains an effective mediator of signal transduction
(11, 12). Following binding of its ligand, neuregulin-1 (NRG1),
ErbB3 does not regularly form homodimers but pairs with other
EGFR family members (13); the ErbB3–ErbB2 heterodimer being
the most potent pairing (14–16). The cytoplasmic tail of ErbB3
contains multiple tyrosine residues, which are phosphorylated by
its coreceptor following NRG1 binding and serve as docking sites
for adaptors, leading to the activation of the PI3K–AKT and MEK–
ERK1/2 signaling pathways (16). Elevated expression of NRG1
and functional NRG1–ErbB3 autocrine loops have been associated with tumor progression in models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (17) and ovarian cancer (18).

There have been remarkable advances in the targeted therapy
options for cutaneous melanoma. Since 2011, the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib, the MEK inhibitor trametinib, and the dabrafenib plus trametinib combination have all
been approved by the FDA for V600E mutant BRAF-harboring
melanoma patients based on their high clinical response rates,
prolonged progression-free survival, and improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy (1–4). Although mutant

Therapeutic Target in WT/WT Melanomas

Activation of ErbB3 is related to the progression of several cancer
types (19). The NRG1–ErbB3 signaling plays an important role in
melanocyte homeostasis (20) and high ErbB3 expression was
detected in 40% (35 out of 87) of melanoma patients and is
associated with poor prognosis (21). Proteomic studies indicate
that ErbB3 is highly phosphorylated in some melanoma cell lines
(22). In mutant BRAF melanomas, ErbB3 expression and ligandstimulated phosphorylation are upregulated by BRAF inhibitors,
such as vemurafenib, as part of an adaptive compensatory mechanism (23). Because of the unmet clinical need for targeted therapy
options in WT/WT melanoma, we examined phosphorylation of
ErbB3 in this subset of melanoma. We show high levels of
phosphorylated ErbB3 and its coreceptor ErbB2 in a subset of
WT/WT melanomas. In this subset, depletion of NRG1 or ErbB3
led to inhibition of downstream AKT phosphorylation and cell
growth. Similarly, antibody-mediated targeting of the ErbB3–
ErbB2 axis impaired the growth of WT/WT melanomas in vitro
and in vivo and potentiated the effects of a MEK inhibitor. These
preclinical data suggest that targeting the NRG1–ErbB3–ErbB2 axis
may serve as a treatment strategy in a subset of WT/WT melanomas.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The human melanoma cell lines CHL-1, SKMEL2, and A375
were purchased from the ATCC. WM3928 cells were purchased
from the Coriell Institute (Camden, NJ). The following cell lines
were kindly donated: Bowes (Dr. Mark Bracke, University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium); YUHEF and YUROL (Dr. Ruth Halaban,
Yale University, New Haven, CT), and CCMMATI (ATI), FEMX,
MEWO, and CCMMB6 (B6; Dr. Barbara Bedogni, Western Reserve
University, Cleveland, OH); SK-MEL173 (Dr. David Solit, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, New York, NY); and WM1346, WM1361A,
WM1366, WM3912, WM3211, WM266-4, WM239-A, and
WM115 (Dr. Meenhard Herlyn, Wistar Institute, Philadelphia,
PA). Cell lines were sequenced in both directions for BRAF and
NRAS mutations (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Short-tandem repeat
(STR) analysis was completed for cell lines in January 2015,
conﬁrming that A375, CHL-1, MEWO, WM3912, WM3928,
WM239-A, WM266-4, WM115, WM1366, SKMEL-2, and Bowes
match known proﬁles, and FEMX, YUROL, SKMEL-173, B6, ATI,
and YUHEF have unique proﬁles. Cell lines were cultured as
follows: CHL-1, ATI, FEMX, MEWO, and B6 (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS); Bowes (MEM with 10% FBS and nonessential
amino acids); YUHEF (Opti-MEM containing 5% FBS); WM1346,
WM1361A, WM1366, WM3912, WM3211, and WM3928

PD0325901 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals LLC.
siRNA and transfection
Cells were transfected with chemically synthesized siRNA
(Dharmacon Inc.) at a ﬁnal concentration of 25 nmol/L using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Sequences used were: CTL,
UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA; NRG1#02 is a Smartpool of four
sequences; NRG1#21, UUUCAAACCCCUCGAGAUA; NRG1#09 is
an on-target modiﬁed form of NRG1#21; ErbB3#08, GCAGUGGAUUCGAGAAGUG; ErbB3#22, AGAUUGUGCUCACGGGACA;

Reverse phase protein array
Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) was performed across a
panel of patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA;
https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/), as previously described
(26–28). Results were normalized across the entire panel of
antibodies and, for pErbB3 representation, the data were normalized for the median of pErbB3 values across all genotypes and log2
transformed.
Western blotting
Cells were washed twice in cold PBS and lysed with Laemmeli
sample buffer. Lysates were resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes. For secreted
NRG1 detection, medium was collected and centrifuged for 30
minutes at 4,000 rpm in an Amicon ultra conical tube. Laemmeli
sample buffer was added and samples resolved by SDS–PAGE.
After blocking in 5% BSA, membranes were incubated with the
indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4 C, followed by incubation with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Bound
antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence
substrate (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was visualized on a VersaDoc Multi-Imager and quantitated using Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies used were: NRG1 (#
MAB377) antibody purchased from R&D Biosystems used for
detection of secreted NRG1, ERK2 (sc-1647), and EGFR (sc-03)
antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; NRG1

cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS containing 1% BSA,
and processed according to the manufacturer's instruction using
the Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Invitrogen).
Samples were analyzed using the FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer.
Annexin V staining
Cells were transfected with siRNAs, as described above. After 72
hours, cells were replated in 3D collagen gels as described previously (29) for further 48 hours. Then, cells were collected and
incubated with Annexin V–APC (BD Biosciences) and propidium

iodide for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were analyzed using the FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer.
Cell growth assays
Cells were plated at low density in individual wells of 6-well
plates and treated, as indicated. Cells were then washed with PBS
and stained with crystal violet solution (0.2% crystal violet in 10%
buffered formalin) for 20 minutes. Subsequently, wells were
washed and air-dried. Plates were scanned and quantitative analysis was performed using the ImageJ software. Pictures were taken
with Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with NIS-Elements AR
3.00 software (Nikon).
In vivo xenograft experiments
The animal experiments were performed in a facility at Thomas
Jefferson University that is accredited by the Association for the
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Studies
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. CHL-1 (5  106) or Bowes (4  106) cells were injected intradermally into the back of female athymic mice (NU/J, Homozygous,
Jackson, 6–8 weeks, 20–25 g) in 100 mL of PBS. When tumors were
palpable, mice were divided in two groups for either vehicle (PBS) or
pertuzumab (2 mg/mL; 200 mg/mouse) treatment. For the combination treatment experiment, mice were divided into four groups:
vehicle, pertuzumab alone, MEK inhibitor alone (PD0325901,
chow 7 mg/kg), and pertuzumab in combination with PD0325901.
Pertuzumab was administered intraperitoneally every 3 days in
100 mL of PBS. Measurements of tumor size were taken every 3 days
using digital calipers, and tumor volume was determined by the
following formula: volume ¼ (length  width2)  0.52.
Immunohistochemistry
Tumors from CHL-1 intradermal xenografts were harvested,
ﬁxed in formalin, and parafﬁn-embedded. Seven control and six
pertuzumab-treated xenografts were immunostained with Ki67
antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Three random images from
each slide were obtained at 400 magniﬁcation. The manual cell
counter feature of the ImageJ64 (NIH, Bethesda, MD) image
analysis software was used to quantify positive and negative cells.
GraphPad Prism was used to perform statistical analysis. Sections
from three control xenografts and three xenografts treated with
pertuzumab were immunostained for pS473 AKT (Cell Signaling
Technology, #6942) and percentage of cells that were immunopositive as well as the relative intensities were determined in a
sample blinded manner.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis for EdU staining, Annexin V, and crystal
violet quantiﬁcation and tumor volume comparison was performed using the Student t test two-tailed, unpaired, assuming
unequal variance. The Spearman correlation coefﬁcient was used
to compare pErbB3, and NRG1 expression levels in melanoma
samples from TCGA. For in vivo experiment data, log-transformed
tumor volumes were analyzed using linear mixed (LME) models
with ﬁxed effects of treatment group, posttreatment days, and
their interaction and random effects of animal in the slope and
intercepts of the animal-speciﬁc growth curves. The ﬁtted LME
model was used to compare mean tumor volumes between
treatment and control groups at each time point between 0 and
24 (pertuzumab alone) or 27 (combination) days for CHL-1–
injected mice and between 0 and 21 days for Bowes-injected mice.

Results
ErbB3 is highly phosphorylated in a subset of WT/WT
melanoma cell lines
To investigate the role of the NRG1–ErbB3 pathway in WT/WT
melanoma, we examined RPPA data from TCGA (https://tcga-data.
nci.nih.gov/tcga/) stratiﬁed for different genetic subclasses of melanomas. A range of phospho-ErbB3 levels were detected in WT/WT
melanomas (Fig. 1A). A similar heterogeneity was observed in
other genotypic subgroups: V600E/K BRAF; other BRAF mutations;
mutant NRAS. Because NRG1, the ligand for ErbB3, may be derived
from either tumor or stromal cells, we examined levels of NRG1
and ErbB family receptors (EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) in
melanoma cell monocultures by Western blot analysis. NRG1 and
ErbB3 were both expressed and phospho-ErbB3 was readily detectable in a subset of WT/WT cell lines, suggesting an autocrine
NRG1–ErbB3 loop in these cells (Fig. 1B and C). Phospho-ErbB3
levels were particularly high in CHL-1 and Bowes cells, intermediate in YUHEF and ATI cells, but low in YUROL and WM3211 and
ﬁve other WT/WT lines (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In the four
mutant BRAF and four mutant NRAS melanoma cell lines tested,
we did not detect high phospho-ErbB3 levels due to mutually
exclusive expression of NRG1 and ErbB3 (Fig. 1C). Consistent with
protein data, mRNA levels of NRG1 were high in CHL-1 and Bowes
cells and intermediate in YUHEF and ATI cells (Supplementary Fig.
S1C). ErbB4 expression was not detected in any of the cell lines
analyzed (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
The lack of targeted inhibitor strategies for WT/WT melanoma
patients is a clinically unmet need and a subset of WT/WT melanoma display an autocrine NRG1–ErbB3 loop; hence, we decided
to focus on this subgroup. To conﬁrm that ErbB3 is hyperactivated
in WT/WT melanoma, we analyzed NRG1 and ErbB3 phosphorylation levels in a cohort of WT/WT human melanoma tissues. In
contrast to human melanocytes (HEM-377 and HEM-475), six out
of nine (67%) human metastatic WT/WT melanoma displayed
highly phosphorylated ErbB3 that was associated with NRG1
expression (Fig. 1D). The relevance of the NRG1–ErbB3 pathway
in WT/WT melanoma was further supported by the statistical
analysis of the TCGA RPPA dataset. The Spearman correlation
coefﬁcient showed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between NRG1
and pErbB3 expression in WT/WT melanoma (Supplementary Fig.
S1E). We do not rule out the possibility that subsets of the mutant
NRAS and mutant BRAF melanoma cohorts may also coexpress
NRG1 and ErbB3. In addition, pErbB3 and NRG1 were coexpressed in 13 out of 42 (31%) of WT/WT patients in the TCGA
RPPA dataset (Fig. 1E). Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that ErbB3
signaling is activated by autocrine production of NRG1 in a subset
of WT/WT cutaneous melanomas.
NRG1 is required for cell growth and survival in WT/WT
melanoma cell lines
We further studied the role of NRG1 in WT/WT melanoma cell
lines. First, we established that CHL-1, Bowes, and YUHEF cell
lines express and secrete NRG1 into the conditioned medium
(Fig. 2A). NRG1 knockdown using multiple siRNAs reduced
NRG1 secretion and levels of phosphorylated ErbB3, ErbB2, AKT,
and ERK1/2 (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). NRG1
knockdown elicited either minor or no effect on STAT3 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Addition of exogenous
NRG1 rescued the effects of silencing, conﬁrming that effects were
speciﬁc to NRG1 knockdown. The reduction of ErbB3 expression

Therapeutic Target in WT/WT Melanomas

following NRG1 knockdown in some cell lines is likely due to the
reduced stability of the receptor in the absence of the ligand and
was not detected at early time points in knockdown experiments
(Supplementary Fig. S2C).
We investigated the functional role of NRG1 in melanoma cells
by EdU incorporation and Annexin V staining assays to measure
S-phase entry and apoptosis, respectively. The depletion of NRG1
in CHL-1 and Bowes cells reduced EdU incorporation (Fig. 2C)
and increased Annexin V staining (Fig. 2D); effects that were
reversed by addition of exogenous NRG1. The increased apoptosis
was associated with upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only
protein, BIM-EL, but no alterations in the expression of the
prosurvival protein, MCL-1 were detected (Supplementary Fig.
S2D). Next, we evaluated the effects of NRG1 knockdown on cell
growth in WT/WT melanoma cells. The efﬁciency of the NRG1
knockdown throughout the duration of the growth assay (7 days)
was validated (Supplementary Fig. S2E). NRG1 depletion dramatically reduced the growth of CHL-1, Bowes, YUHEF, and ATI
cells, effects that were rescued by addition of exogenous NRG1
(Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S2F). NRG1 depletion in NRG1epxressing mutant NRAS melanoma cell lines, WM1346,
WM1361A, and WM1366, did not alter AKT phosphorylation,
EdU incorporation, or cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S2G–S2I),
likely due to the low/undetectable levels of ErbB3 in these cells
(Fig. 1B). Together, these data indicate that NRG1 regulates cell
growth and apoptosis in a subset of WT/WT melanoma cell lines
that display high levels of phospho-ErbB3.
Depletion of ErbB3 reduces S-phase entry and cell growth and
induces apoptosis
NRG1 binds to both ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors. Although
mutations in ErbB4 have been identiﬁed in melanoma (30), we
were unable to detect ErbB4 expression in our cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Given the changes in phospho-ErbB3 associated with NRG1 knockdown, we tested the requirement of ErbB3
in WT/WT melanoma by siRNA-mediated depletion. Similar to
effects with NRG1 depletion, ErbB3 knockdown with two independent siRNAs reduced the phosphorylation of ErbB2, AKT, and
ERK1/2 in CHL-1 and Bowes cells (Fig. 3A and Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Depletion of ErbB3 was also associated with reduced Sphase entry and enhanced apoptosis in both cell lines (Fig. 3B and
C). Finally, knockdown of ErbB3 in CHL-1 and Bowes cells plated
at clonal density signiﬁcantly reduced cell growth (Fig. 3D). These
data show that in phospho-ErbB3 high WT/WT melanoma, ErbB3
is required for growth and survival.
Targeting ErbB3 with neutralizing antibodies reduces
phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 and inhibits cell growth
Because our results suggest that inhibiting NRG1 and ErbB3
signaling is a rational therapeutic strategy in WT/WT melanoma
cells showing evidence of pathway activation, we tested the effects
of two ErbB3 targeting monoclonal antibodies, NG33 and
huHER3-8. NG33 is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the

binding of NRG1 to the ErbB3 receptor (25). huHER3-8 is a
high-afﬁnity, antagonistic anti-ErbB3 antibody that binds within
residues 20 and 342 of ErbB3 and outcompetes NRG1 binding
(31). Treatment of WT/WT melanoma cell lines with either NG33
or huHER3-8 reduced phospho-ErbB3 and phospho-ErbB2 (Fig.
4A and B). Furthermore, treatment with either antibody also
reduced AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S4). Although AKT reactivation was noted at
later time points, levels remained reduced 70% compared with
the untreated conditions throughout the 48-hour treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4). ErbB3 neutralization also inhibited the
expression and hyperphosphorylation of the G1–S phase markers,
cyclin A2 and Rb, respectively (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, NG33 and
huHER3-8 reduced growth of CHL-1 and Bowes cells (Fig. 4D). As
a control, no effect was observed following huHER3-8 treatment
in the ErbB3-deﬁcient, mutant NRAS cell lines, WM1346 and
WM1361A (Fig. 4E). These data show that targeting an autocrine
NRG1–ErbB3 pathway with neutralizing antibodies reduces
growth of WT/WT melanoma cells.
Inhibition of ErbB2–ErbB3 dimerization with pertuzumab
decreases AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell growth
in vitro and in vivo
ErbB3 is a catalytically impaired member of the ErbB family and
partners with other ErbB family members in response to NRG1
binding (32). Our results show that NRG1 knockdown and ErbB3
targeting decreased phospho-ErbB2 levels. To determine whether
ErbB2 is required for phospho-ErbB3 levels in WT/WT melanoma
cells, CHL-1 cells were depleted of ErbB2. Knockdown of ErbB2
abolished phosphorylation of ErbB3, AKT, and ERK1/2 (Fig. 5A).
In addition, treatment of CHL-1, Bowes, and ATI cells with
pertuzumab, a clinical grade antibody that inhibits ErbB2–ErbB3
dimerization, effectively reduced the levels of ErbB3, AKT, and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation at all doses and times analyzed (Fig. 5B
and Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Notably, pertuzumab did
not alter AKT or ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the ErbB3-deﬁcient,
mutant NRAS cell lines, WM1361-A and WM1366 (Supplementary Fig. S5C). These data indicate that ErbB2 is required for
ErbB3 activation in WT/WT melanoma cells displaying high
phospho-ErbB3.
Next, we tested the effects of pertuzumab on WT/WT melanoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Similar to effects with huHER38, pertuzumab reduced cyclin A expression and Rb hyperphosphorylation in CHL-1 and Bowes cells (Fig. 5C). In in vitro colony
growth assays, pertuzumab signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of
CHL-1, Bowes, and ATI at all doses indicated (Fig. 5D and
Supplementary Fig. S5D). WT/WT cell lines with low NRG1
expression did not show dependency on this pathway (Supplementary Fig. S5E). Similar to huHER3-8, pertuzumab did not
induce any effect on cell growth in the mutant NRAS cell lines
analyzed, WM1346, WM1361A, SKMEL2, and SKMEL173 (Fig. 5E
and Supplementary Fig. S5F). For in vivo analysis, CHL-1 and
Bowes cells were injected intradermally in athymic mice. Palpable

Therapeutic Target in WT/WT Melanomas

xenograft tumors were treated with either vehicle or pertuzumab every 3 days. Compared with control tumors, we observed
a dramatic reduction in tumor growth in pertuzumab-treated
mice (Fig. 6A and B). This effect was evident and statistically
signiﬁcant as early as days 6 and 3 following treatment with
pertuzumab for CHL-1 and Bowes xenografts, respectively.
Reduced tumor growth was associated with reduction in phospho-AKT staining (Fig. 6C) and a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in Ki67 staining in tumors treated with pertuzumab
compared with the control tumors (Fig. 6D).
To investigate whether the reduction of AKT phosphorylation is
a major mechanism of pertuzumab action, we used the AKT
inhibitor, MK2206. Consistently, we observed a dose-dependent
reduction of AKT phosphorylation associated with reduction of
cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S5G and S5H). Because of the
stronger effects observed following pertuzumab treatment, we do
not rule out the possibility that ErbB3 also acts through AKTindependent mechanisms (33). Because we detected a partial
reactivation of AKT signaling following ErbB3/2 antibody treatment, we tested pertuzumab in combination with the AKT inhibitor, MK2206. Although we observed reduced cell growth with the
combination, only a very modest increase in apoptosis was
observed (Supplementary Fig. S5I and Fig. S5L). These data are
consistent with the in vitro ErbB3–ErbB2 targeting data and
indicate that WT/WT melanomas exhibiting high levels of phospho-ErbB3 may be treatable with an FDA-approved agent.
MEK inhibition potentiates the effects of pertuzumab on cell
growth in vitro and in vivo
Because of the frequent dependence of melanomas on the
ERK1/2 pathway, we considered the effects of the combination
of pertuzumab with the MEK inhibitor, GSK'212 (trametinib), in
this subgroup of WT/WT cell lines. With GSK'212 treatment alone,
we observed a dose-dependent growth reduction in CHL-1 and
Bowes cells that was associated with decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7A). The combined treatment of pertuzumab with
GSK'212 signiﬁcantly potentiated the effect, resulting in a significant reduction in cell growth in CHL-1 and Bowes cells compared
with each single agent in vitro (Fig. 7B). In vivo, the combined
action of pertuzumab and MEK inhibitor (PD0325901) signiﬁcantly reduced CHL-1 xenograft growth compared with either
MEK inhibitor alone or pertuzumab alone (Fig. 7C and Supplementary Fig. S6). These data indicate that MEK inhibitors may
enhance the effects of targeting the ErbB3/2 pathway in NRG1expressing WT/WT melanomas.

Discussion
Emerging data suggest a role for the growth factor receptor
ErbB3 in promoting tumorigenesis and mediating compensatory
signaling in response to targeted inhibitors. Despite evidence for
an important developmental role of ErbB3 in the melanocytic
lineage, its function in cutaneous melanoma has been unclear.
Phospho-ErbB3 levels in patient samples were heterogeneous in
the three main genetic subgroups of melanoma: mutant BRAF,
mutant NRAS, and WT for both BRAF and NRAS. We have
previously shown that in mutant BRAF melanomas, baseline
ErbB3 signaling does not dramatically effect tumor growth but
it is upregulated in response to BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and mediates adaptive resistance (23, 34). Furthermore,
unphosphorylated ErbB3 was readily detectable in many mutant

www.aacrjournals.org

BRAF lines and is associated with low-undetectable levels of
NRG1. In this study, we investigated the role of NRG1–ErbB3
signaling in melanomas that are wild-type for both BRAF and
NRAS (WT/WT). We demonstrate that the ligand for ErbB3,
NRG1, is highly expressed and activates ErbB3 signaling in an
autocrine manner in a subset of WT/WT melanomas. Furthermore, we show that NRG1–ErbB3–ErbB2 signaling is required for
malignant traits and inhibition of this signaling axis is a rational
therapeutic strategy within this melanoma subset.
Initially, we observed that basal ErbB3 phosphorylation and
NRG1 expression are frequently elevated in WT/WT melanomas
cell lines and patient samples in the TCGA dataset. Other studies
have shown that ErbB3 is highly expressed in 40% (35 out of 87)
of melanoma metastases (21) and is associated with a proliferative phenotype in melanoma (35); however, these studies lack
genotype stratiﬁcation. Studies analyzing NRG1 expression in
melanoma have provided differing views. Although one report
showed coexpression of ErbB3 and NRG1 in a subset of human
metastatic melanomas (36), another study showed low expression of NRG1 in melanoma cells (37). The high phospho-ErbB3
level detected in TCGA samples (this study) and in 27% of
melanoma metastases (20) likely reﬂects melanomas that express
ErbB3 and either coexpress NRG1 or reside in a tumor microenvironment enriched with secreted NRG1. Other WT/WT cell lines
showed mutually exclusive expression of NRG1 and ErbB3 indicating the presence of other tumor-driving mechanisms and
underscoring the need to investigate clinically applicable biomarkers. ErbB3–ErbB2 activation was also detected in some mutant
BRAF and mutant NRAS tumors but the presence of a driver
mutation may reduce the functional dependency on ErbB3 in
this context.
In this study, we observed that four out of 11 WT/WT melanoma cell lines showed dependency on the NRG1 pathway. Given
the clinical unmet need for targeted therapies in the WT/WT
genotype, we explored the effects of blockade of this pathway in
the subset of WT/WT cell lines that express both ErbB3 and NRG1.
First, we showed that NRG1 is required for phosphorylation of
ErbB3, ErbB2, and AKT. The NRG1 gene generates at least 31
isoforms through alternative promoter usage and splicing (38). In
this study, we used siRNAs that knockdown both a and b isoforms
of NRG1. The cytoplasmic tail of ErbB3 harbors six high afﬁnity
TxxM binding sites for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, leading
to AKT activation (39, 40) and our data are consistent with this
pathway being controlled by ErbB3 in WT/WT melanoma. However, we do not exclude that PI3K signaling may additionally
regulate melanoma proliferation through AKT-independent signaling (33). Depleting NRG1 led to decreases in S-phase entry,
survival in 3D extracellular matrices and cell growth, demonstrating that WT/WT cell lines displaying high levels of phospho-ErbB3
are dependent on autocrine NRG1 signaling. We also directly
targeted ErbB3 using either molecular reagents or neutralizing
antibodies. Both approaches led to comparable ﬁndings to effects
seen targeting NRG1, indicating that ErbB3 is the main functional
target of NRG1 in these cells. Notably, there are multiple efforts to
generate clinical grade ErbB3 neutralizing agents and in this study
we used two independent antibodies that both inhibit NRG1
binding as well as block ErbB3 dimerization with coreceptors.
Other ErbB3 neutralizing antibodies such as U3-1287 (U3Pharma), MM-121 (Merrimack), and LJM716 (Novartis) are
currently being tested in the preclinical and clinical settings
(41–43). Because our material transfer agreements exclude the

(44–46). This raises the possibility of NRG1 RNA levels serving as
a biomarker for WT/WT melanomas that will respond to ErbB3
targeting.

Analysis of the coreceptor for ErbB3 also afforded targeting
opportunities. ErbB3 is able to partner with multiple coreceptors
but primarily uses ErbB2 in WT/WT melanoma cells. ErbB2 is the
most potent pairing for ErbB3 (14, 15) and is also the preferred
partner for ErbB3 in mutant BRAF melanoma cells treated with
RAF inhibitors (23). Although we did not detect ErbB4 expression
in our cell lines, we do not rule out a partial role for ErbB4 in these
cells. Pertuzumab, an antibody that binds ErbB2 and targets
ErbB2 dimerization with ErbB3, was recently FDA-approved for
metastatic breast cancer in combination with trastuzumab and
docetaxel (47). The ﬁnding that pertuzumab potently blocks
signaling and growth of phospho-ErbB3-positive WT/WT melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo further highlights the dependency of this subgroup of melanomas on the ErbB3–ErbB2
pathway. These data also provide the basis for exploring pertuzumab as part of a ﬁrst-line treatment option in WT/WT melanoma patients who display high levels of phospho-ErbB3, phospho-ErbB2, and NRG1. Many current clinical trials use anti-ErbB3
targeting agents in combination with chemotherapies and there is
a growing awareness that drug combinations are needed in order
to obtain durable responses in patients. Because GSK'212/trametinib is FDA-approved for mutant BRAF melanoma, we explored
the effects of blocking ErbB3 and MEK in phospho-ErbB3-positive
WT/WT melanoma cells. Importantly, the combination of pertuzumab with MEK inhibitor was more effective at blocking growth
than either as a single agent in vitro and in vivo. We did observe
tumor regressions with this combination in our in vivo study
suggesting dependencies on additional pathways and/or the need
to examine ways to maximally target the ErbB3 signaling pathway.
In summary, a subgroup of melanoma cell lines and patient
samples, which are wild-type for both BRAF and NRAS, display
elevated activation of the NRG1–ErbB3 pathway. By targeting
NRG1, ErbB3, or ErbB2, we demonstrate that this subset of
cutaneous melanomas exhibit dependency on this signaling axis.
Thus, our study provides preclinical evidence for directly targeting
ErbB3 and/or ErbB2 in a subset of WT/WT melanomas.
