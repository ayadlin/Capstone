ABSTRACT
Background: We assessed the impact on survival of angiogenesis and
inflammation-related factors, particularly LDH serum levels, platelet, neutrophil and
lymphocyte counts, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), in metastatic colorectal
cancer patients receiving regorafenib monotherapy.
Methods: LDH serum levels, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts were
collected at the start of regorafenib monotherapy. Cut-off values were calculated by
ROC curve analysis. Survival analyses were performed by Kaplan-Meier method, and
multivariate analysis by Cox method.
Results: A total of 208 patients were eligible for analysis. Among factors who
were related with worse overall survival and who maintained their role at the
multivariate analysis, high platelet count (Exp(b):1.4963, 95% CI:1.0130–2.2103,
p = 0.0439) and high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (Exp(b):1.6963, 95% CI:1.0757–
2.6751, p = 0.0237) were those who more deeply were related to worse overall
survival. High lymphocyte count (Exp(b):0.4527, 95% CI:0.2801–0.7316, p = 0.0013)
was correlated with improved overall survival.
Conclusions: High neutrophil, high platelet, low lymphocyte count and/or high
NLR may represent negative prognostic factors in patients receiving regorafenib
monotherapy. It is advisable that these factors are taken into account in the design
of subsequent trials in colorectal cancer patients receiving this drug.

factors for treatment efficacy/resistance along with the
distinct toxicity profile of this novel compound, requires
a very well balanced clinical assessment of the risk to
benefit ratio in each patient potentially candidate to
such a treatment approach. Indeed, even in carefully
selected cases, available data seem to indicate that a
not negligible proportion of patients does not derive
any benefit from this treatment and is thus exposed to
unnecessary toxicity.

INTRODUCTION
The introduction of regorafenib represented a
significant step forward in the treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. This novel oral
multikinase inhibitor improved both progression free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in heavily pretreated patients otherwise not suitable for any further
active therapy [1]. However, the absence of predictive

was significantly higher than before treatment in patients
achieving an objective tumour response [27]. An elevated
NLR has been shown to represent a predictive factor for
clinical outcome in patients with liver-only colorectal
metastases receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy [28].
Accordingly Chua et al demonstrated an independent
predictive value in terms of clinical benefit, PFS and
OS for pre-treatment NLR in patients with unresectable
mCRC undergoing first-line chemotherapy [29]. Many
clinical and pre-clinical findings also underscored the
role of platelets in different tumour related events.
Activated platelets, in response to tissue impairment, can
induce a pro-inflammatory response leading to increased
concentrations of pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic
factors [30]. Globally the potential link between systemic
inflammation and tumour angiogenesis and thus the
hypothetical predictive role of inflammatory markers
during antiangiogenetic therapies has been evaluated in
CRC patients treated with bevacizumab with interesting
insights into the biological mechanisms underlying the
interaction between inflammation, angiogenesis and antiVEGF therapy [31].
Aim of the present study was to assess the role
of angiogenesis and inflammation-related factors such
as LDH serum levels, platelet count, neutrophil and
lymphocyte count, and NLR in predicting clinical outcome
for pre-treated mCRC patients receiving regorafenib. This
was done in order to individuate potentially reliable and
easy to use markers for patients stratification and selection.

It is hypothised that tumour-driven neoangiogenesis
represents the main biological target of regorafenib:
molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis may be
then considered as important predictive factors for clinical
outcome during regorafenib treatment.
The biological link between hypoxia, lactic
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and the tumour-driven
angiogenesis pathway through the abnormal activation
of the Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 α (HIF1-α) is well
established [2, 3]. Since LDH and pro-angiogenesis
factors are regulated by the same HIF1α-driven molecular
pathway, high LDH levels are concomitantly present
along with abnormal activation of the VEGF pathway [4].
Accordingly to this biological assumption, Azuma et al [5]
demonstrated that high LDH serum levels were associated
with tumour over-expression of VEGFA and VEGFR-1.
As a clinical consequence it has been speculated that LDH
levels may represent an indirect indicator of activated
tumour angiogenesis and worse prognosis [6–7]. In
CRC, a significantly correlation has been demonstrated
between LDH overexpression and increased risk of
metastases, and between high LDH serum levels and
worse prognosis [8–9]. The role of LDH in CRC patients
receiving anti-angiogenic therapy is more controversial.
In an exploratory analysis of the CONFIRM-1 and
2 trials, median PFS resulted improved with the use of
PTK/ZK (vatalanib, an oral inhibitor of VEGF-receptors)
in the subgroup of patients with high serum LDH [10–11].
Recently Koukourakis et al also demonstrated that serum
LDH and tissue LDH-5 are complementary features that
may help characterizing the activity of LDH in CRC
[12]. Accordingly with these observations we previously
suggested that pre-treatment LDH levels may represent a
relevant factor for the prediction of bevacizumab efficacy
in an unselected population of CRC patients [13].
Neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet count have
been identified as markers of clinical outcome in different
tumour types, in particular in heavily treated mCRC
patients.
Leucocytes, including neutrophils and lymphocytes,
were reported to play an important role in tumour
inflammation and immunology [16] and to have a
prognostic value in patients with cancer [14–17]. In
particular, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is
a combined indicator of inflammation and immunology
activity. In recent years, several studies evaluated the
prognostic role of NLR in many tumour types, including
CRC, suggesting that an elevated NLR could be related to
an adverse outcome [17–23]. The results from a recently
published meta-analysis indicated that a high pre-treatment
NLR was significantly related to poorer OS and PFS [23].
Recent studies also evaluated the correlation between
inflammation and tumour response to chemotherapy in
various tumour types [24–26]. Lissoni et al suggested
that a decreasing lymphocyte count during chemotherapy
might be correlated with tumour progression. On the

RESULTS
Univariate analysis
Globally 208 patients were available for our
analysis. Median age at the start of treatment was 61
(Range 32–90). All major clinical characteristics have
been summarised in table 1. In the global population
median OS was 3.5 months whereas median PFS was
2.4 months. Among 202 patients who were assessable for
response, 10 (5%) achieved at least a partial response, 58
(29%) obtained disease stabilization and the remaining
134 (66%) showed progressive disease.
The cut-off point with the highest sensitivity and
specificity for estimating pre-treatment LDH serum levels,
neutrophil level, lymphocyte level, platelet count and
NLR as a function of treatment clinical activity was set
at 1.21 ULN, 0.96 ULN, 1.77 LLN, 0.54 ULN and 0.38
respectively after ROC analyses.
Among the 95 (46%) patients showing LDH serum
levels ≥ 1.21 ULN, median OS was significantly shorter
than among the remaining 113 (54%) patients (3.3 months
vs. 7.6 months, HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25–0.53, p < 0.0001)
(Figure 1). Accordingly, a statistically significant difference
was evident for median PFS (1.7 months vs. 2.5 months

level and a high NLR, with the latter showing the
greatest impact on median PFS (Exp(b):1.7332,
95% CI:1.1752–2.5560, p = 0.0058).
By applying correction for multiple testing errors, all
factors resulting independently related to overall survival
maintained their statistical significance (lymphocyte count
p = 0.0125, neutrophil count p  =  0.0166, neutrophil/
lymphocyte count p = 0.025, platelet count p = 0.05).
Among 52 (25%) patients who were negative for
all risk factors, a significant correlation was found with
improved OS and PFS if compared with the group of
patients with at least 1 risk factor. In particular, median
OS was respectively 15.9 vs 3.1 months (HR: 3.81, 95%
CI: 2.32–4.82, p < 0.0001) whereas median PFS was 5.9
vs 2.1 months (HR: 2.62, 95% CI: 2.06–3.86, p < 0.0001).
(Table 2).
On the basis of the results of the multivariate
analysis, a prognostic score was developed.
In particular, for the presence of each a risk factor
(high neutrophil/lymphocyte count, high platelet count,
high neutrophil count) the patients’ risk score was raised
by 1. Furthermore, the absence of high lymphocyte count
was considered as another 2 point increase in the scoring,
due to the greater role as protective factor of lymphocyte
count. On this basis, patients’ scoring could range between
0 (extremely favourable) to 5 (extremely unfavourable).
When overall survival was assessed on the basis of the
scoring system, patients with extremely favourable
prognosis had risk of death compared with patients with
just 1 risk factor about 6 times lower (HR:0.1627, 95%
CI:0.08454–0.3130, p < 0.0001). This difference was even
greater when considering other risk groups (Figure  7).
This relatively small group of patients (22/208, 11%) had
a median overall survival that was not still reached at the
time of data analysis.

Despite regorafenib exhibited a small, but
indisputable survival benefit in CRC patients not suitable
for any further active treatment, the relevant toxicity
profile along with the virtual absence of predictive factors
suggested a careful evaluation of the benefit to risk ratio
before widespread use in clinical practice.
The results of our analysis supports the idea that
high pre-treatment NLR, high platelet and neutrophil
count, and a low lymphocyte count are significantly and
independently associated with worse clinical outcome in
mCRC patients treated with regorafenib.
This is not surprising as it is generally accepted
and demonstrated that the inflammatory process
involving tumour microenvironment plays a crucial role
in promoting proliferation, invasion and metastases of
malignant cells [16, 32]. The infiltrating leucocytes,
including neutrophils and lymphocytes, are critical factors
for this biological process. Different proangiogenic factors
such as the vascular endothelial growth factors originate
from neutrophils and platelets-induced stimulation in the
peripheral blood or in the tumour microenvironment and
are eventually responsible for tumour progression [33].
Various clinical data highlighted the role of platelet levels
in mCRC: a pre-planned sub-group analysis from the
COIN trial, for example, suggested that patients with a
high platelet count may not be optimal candidates for an
intermittent strategy, thus remarking the poor prognostic
profile of these patients [34].
Lymphocytes have been described as crucial
components of the adaptive immune system and as
the cellular basis of cancer immunosurveillance and
immunoediting [35]. As a biological consequence, tumour
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been frequently

Figure 7: Kaplan-Meier curves for median overall survival (OS) in pre-treated metastatic colorectal cancer patients
receiving regorafenib according to risk scoring: high PLT (+1), high neutrophil (+1), high neutrophil/lymphocyte (+1),
low lymphocyte (+2)
reported as indicator of an effective anti-tumour cellular
immune response [36]. A low lymphocyte count may be
responsible for an inadequate host-to-tumour immunologic
reaction with a consequently decreased response against
cancer, leading to poor clinical outcome.
The NLR has been already evaluated as prognostic
factor in many tumour types as well as in CRC, usually
related to an adverse outcome [17–23]. According to our
data, NLR has been also indicated as a potentially relevant
prognostic/predictive factor in CRC patients receiving an
anti-angiogenic treatment such as bevacizumab [31].
In presence of stronger predictors of worse outcome,
high LDH lost its independent role in influencing
survival. In contrast to previous analyses in colorectal
cancer patients receiving anti-angiogenic treatment in
our experience high LDH serum levels indicated a trend
toward a worse clinical outcome, rather than representing
a predictive factor for response [11, 12]. We believe that
the different setting analysed in our analysis might explain
this apparent discrepancy. We can speculate that in early
lines of treatment hypoxic factors might directly influence
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

circulating isoforms of LDH such as LDH5 as predictors
of efficacy to anti-VEGF therapy. On the contrary in latter
lines of treatment, high levels of unselected LDH might be
related to the heavy involvement of vital organs, such as
the liver, regardless of the presence of an hypoxic drive.
Due to the independent prognostic role of all factors
who have been included into the analysis, we hypothised
that patients sub-groups with different clinical outcome
during regorafenib treatment could be identified by taking
into account all these factors combined. In particular,
patients exhibiting a favourable profile (i.e. those without
poor predictive indicators) seemed to benefit the most
from the use of regorafenib.
The retrospective nature of this analysis and the lack
of a proper control group (patients analysed for all the
factors taken into account that received only BSC opposed
to regorafenib treatment) prevents from drawing definitive
conclusions on the prognostic or predictive value of the
clinical factors analysed. It must be said that our analysis
showed, in the group of patients who did not have any risk
factor, not only an improved OS but also a significantly

improved PFS. This latter observation may suggest a
predictive more than a prognostic value of such factors.
Based on our findings, we can speculate that mCRC
patients showing pre-treatment high neutrophil level, high
platelet level, low lymphocytes level or high NLR may not
be optimal candidates for regorafenib treatment. In these
patients the risk of toxicity may not be in fact entirely
balanced by the presumably poor clinical benefit deriving
from treatment.
We believe that, after confirmation in further
prospectively stratified and larger series, these clinical
factors may play a relevant role in guiding treatment
decision and prognostic stratification for patients
receiving regorafenib. It would also be interesting to
verify whether other factors (such as regorafenib starting
dose or lack of anti-VEGF therapy in previous lines)
might affect survival during regorafenib monotherapy.
However this correlation was not possible in our
paper as all patients included had already received
bevacizumab and were started on regorafenib at the full
dose of 160 mg/die).
Laboratory exams such as white blood cell count
have a substantial advantage if compared with, although
“fashionable”, biomolecular analyses: reproducibility and
simplicity to obtain results without the need to perform
more invasive tests. This could prove crucial in a setting
where the identification of different risk-groups represents
a key-challenge for the treatment of this disease,
particularly now that different options are available and
many more are hopefully to come.

collected within one month before the start of treatment.
All patients should have started treatment at the dose of
160 mg/die, subsequent dose reductions were performed
on the basis of tolerance to treatment as assessed by
treating clinicians.

Laboratory exams specifics
All laboratory exams where determined according
to IFCC (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry
and Laboratory Medicine) method. The assay has been
conducted in Institution Laboratories certified for Quality
control according to the present rules in Europe.
For study purposes, LDH levels for each patient was
calculated as the ratio between LDH serum levels at the
beginning of the treatment with regorafenib and the uppernormal-limit (UNL) for the laboratory where the test was
performed.
Neutrophil level was determined as the ratio
between neutrophil level at the treatment start and the
upper-normal-limit (UNL) for the laboratory where the
test was performed. Lymphocyte level was determined
as the ratio between lymphocyte level at the treatment
start and the lower-limit-normal (LLN) for the laboratory
where the test was performed.
Platelets level was determined as the ratio between
platelets level at the treatment start and the uppernormal-limit (UNL) for the laboratory where the test was
performed.
By performing the ratio between the point value of
the single test by the LLN and UNL, we standardized the
values of the determinations between the 3 laboratories
where tests were performed.
Cut-off values for LDH, neutrophil, lymphocyte,
NLR and platelet levels were determined by receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis in the
whole patients population, assuming PFS (>2 months) as
a classification variable.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients selection
Histologically-proven mCRC patients who received
regorafenib monotherapy after failure of previous
chemotherapy regimens based on all standard drugs active
in this setting (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5FU, bevacizumab
and either cetuximab or panitumumab in case of RAS wild
type tumour) were eligible for analysis.
Patients received regorafenib into the CORRECT
and CONSIGN trials at our Institution (Ancona, Italy),
at the Medical Oncology Department of the “Fondazione
Poliambulanza” (Brescia, Italy), or at the Oncology
Department of the “Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria
Pisana” (Pisa, Italy). All patients had already received
treatment with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5FU/
capecitabine and, in K-ras/RAS wild type patients, antiEGFR monoclonal antibodies.
Treatment schedule was as follows: regorafenib
160  mg/die (day 1 to 21 every 28 days). Tumour
response was evaluated every 8 weeks by clinicians’
assessment and according to the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). LDH serum
levels, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelets count were

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the MedCalc
package (MedCalc® v9.4.2.0).
The association between categorical variables was
assessed by chi-square test.
Survival distribution was estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method. Significant differences in
probability of relapsing between the strata were evaluated
by log-rank test. Cox multiple regression analysis was
used to assess the role of variables resulted significant at
univariate analysis (multivariate analysis).
Other tested variables included gender (male vs.
female), age ( <65 yrs vs. ≥ 65 yrs), RAS mutational
status (wild type vs. mutated), metastatic sites (< 2 vs.
≥ 2), previous adjuvant chemotherapy, previous systemic
anticancer therapy (≤ 2 vs. 3 vs. ≥ 4).

A significant level of 0.05 was chosen to assess the
statistical significance.
For statistical analysis, OS and PFS were defined
respectively as the interval between the start of treatment
to death or last follow-up visit and as the interval between
the start of treatment to clinical progression or death or
last follow up visit if not progressed.
Correction for multiple testing errors has been
performed by the Holm-Sidak method.
