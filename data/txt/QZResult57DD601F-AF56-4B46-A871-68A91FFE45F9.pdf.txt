SUMMARY
Glucocorticoid resistance is a major driver of therapeutic failure in T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (T-ALL). Here we identify the AKT1 kinase as a major negative regulator of the NR3C1

Mechanistically, AKT1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation
of NR3C1 at position S134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the
nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN and consequent AKT1 activation can
effectively block glucocorticoid induced apoptosis and induce resistance to glucocorticoid therapy.
Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoidinduced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to
glucocorticoid therapy and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Glucocorticoids are small lipophilic compounds derived from cortisol, a natural adrenal
hormone that signals via the glucocorticoid receptor alpha, a nuclear receptor ligandactivated transcription factor encoded by the NR3C1 gene (Schlossmacher et al., 2011).
Glucocorticoids play a fundamental role in the treatment of all lymphoid tumors because of
their capacity to induce apoptosis in lymphoid progenitor cells (Inaba and Pui, 2010; Pui et
al., 2011; Pui et al., 2012). The importance of glucocorticoid therapy in lymphoid
malignancies is underscored by the strong association of primary glucocorticoid resistance
with poor prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thus, prednisone
poor response, defined as failure to show effective cytoreduction after 7 days of
glucocorticoid therapy is strongly associated with increased risk of relapse and therapeutic
failure (Dordelmann et al., 1999; Inaba and Pui, 2010) and in vitro resistance to
glucocorticoids is associated with unfavorable prognosis in this disease (Hongo et al., 1997;
Inaba and Pui, 2010; Klumper et al., 1995).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Primary glucocorticoid resistance is particularly frequent in T-ALL (Hongo et al., 1997;
Inaba and Pui, 2010; Klumper et al., 1995), leading us to hypothesize that activation of one
or more oncogenic signaling pathways implicated in T-cell transformation could be driving
primary glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL directly by interfering with glucocorticoid
receptor function or indirectly via inhibition of glucocorticoid induced apoptosis. In this
context, the AKT1 gene emerged as a plausible candidate as PI3K-AKT activation plays a
major role in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, particularly in leukemias harboring mutations and
deletions in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene (Palomero et al., 2007). Moreover, in silico
analysis of signaling factors modulating transcriptional signatures associated with
glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL pointed to a potential role of AKT1 as driver of
glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL. These results together with the association of
mutational loss of PTEN and increased AKT1 phosphorylation with primary glucocorticoid
resistance in the clinic (Bandapalli et al., 2013; Morishita et al., 2012) and the availability of
PI3K-AKT specific inhibitors in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancer, prompted
us to analyze the mechanistic role of AKT1 in the control of glucocorticoid resistance in TALL.

RESULTS
AKT1 binds to the NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor protein
Activation of gene expression by glucocorticoids is a multistep process that requires
effective release of the glucocorticoid receptor from heat shock protein complexes,
translocation to the nucleus and formation of a multiprotein transcriptional complex on the
promoter of glucocorticoid target genes (Heitzer et al., 2007). To test if AKT1 can interact
with and inhibit the glucocorticoid receptor protein, we transfected 293T cells with plasmid
constructs driving the expression of Flag-tagged AKT1 and HA-tagged NR3C1 and isolated
glucocorticoid receptor-containing protein complexes via immunoprecipitation using an
anti-HA antibody. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of Flag-AKT1 in HA-

NR3C1 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that AKT1 can interact with NR3C1 in vivo (Figure
1A). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the association between FlagAKT1 and HA-NR3C1 (Figure 1B). Moreover, immunoprecipitation of NR3C1 protein
complexes from the T-ALL cell lines DND41 and CCRF-CEM demonstrated that
endogenous NR3C1 and AKT1 can interact in T-ALL lymphoblast cells (Figure 1C and
Figure S1A). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis showed colocalization of NR3C1
and AKT1 in DND41 and CCRF-CEM cells (Figure 1D and Figure S1B). Finally,
glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pulldown assays showed that recombinant GST-NR3C1
fusion protein can directly interact with His-tagged AKT1 in vitro (Figure 1E).
AKT1 phosphorylates S134 in the NR3C1 protein

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

AKT1 kinase substrates are typically phosphorylated by AKT at RXRXXS/T motifs (Mok et
al., 1999; Ozes et al., 1999; Zimmermann and Moelling, 1999). Phospho-AKT motif
scanning analysis of NR3C1 revealed a potential AKT phosphorylation motif 131RSTS134
(Figure 1F and Figure S1C), suggesting that the glucocorticoid receptor could be an AKT1
substrate phosphorylated at serine 134. To test this possibility, we expressed HA-tagged
wild type NR3C1 (HA-NR3C1) or an HA-tagged form of the glucocorticoid receptor with a
serine to alanine substitution at position 134 (HA-NR3C1 S134A) in cells infected with
retroviruses expressing MYR-AKT1. Protein immunoprecipitation of NR3C1 with an
antibody against HA and subsequent Western blot analysis with an antibody recognizing the
phospho-RXXS/T AKT phosphorylation motif showed the presence of a HA-NR3C1
phospho-AKT band in cells expressing the wild type glucocorticoid receptor, but not in cells
expressing the HA-NR3C1 S134A mutant (Figure 1G). Consistently, in vitro kinase assays
in which we analyzed the capacity of the AKT1 kinase to phosphorylate the wild type or
S134A glucocorticoid receptor proteins demonstrated that AKT1 can effectively
phosphorylate recombinant wild type NR3C1 protein in vitro, but not the serine 134 to
alanine NR3C1 mutant protein (Figure 1H). Mass spectrometry analysis of HA-NR3C1
protein isolated from MYR-AKT1 expressing cells demonstrated the presence of serine
phosphorylation at position 134 of the glucocorticoid receptor (Figure 1I,J), which was
effectively abrogated (control S134P:non-P = 0.47; MK2206 S134P:non-P = 0.03; Table S1)
upon treatment with MK2206, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of AKT (Hirai et al.,
2010). Finally, and most notably, western blot analysis with the AKT phosphorylation motif
antibody showed decreased AKT phosphorylated NR3C1 in NR3C1 immunoprecipitates
from CCRF-CEM T-ALL cells upon AKT inhibition with MK2206 (Figure 1K).
AKT signaling inhibits NR3C1 nuclear translocation following glucocorticoid treatment

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

After establishing the interaction and phosphorylation of the glucocorticoid receptor by
AKT1 we sought to elucidate the relevance of the NR3C1 S134 phosphorylation for
glucocorticoid receptor function. Glucocorticoid induced cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling is
strictly required for glucocorticoid receptor activity, which functions as a ligand activated
transcription factor (Heitzer et al., 2007). U2OS cells, which express undetectable levels of
endogenous NR3C1 (Figure S2A), showed cytoplasmic localization of retrovirally
expressed HA-tagged glucocorticoid receptor protein, which was completely relocalized to
the nucleus upon dexamethasone treatment (Figure 2A). Notably, expression of MYRAKT1 in these cells resulted in impaired nuclear relocalization of NR3C1 after
dexamethasone treatment (Figure 2B). In addition, and in contrast with wild type
glucocorticoid receptor, the NR3C1 S134A mutant protein showed increased nuclear
localization in basal conditions and effective nuclear relocalization upon dexamethasone
treatment (Figure 2C), even upon expression of MYR-AKT1 (Figure 2D). Next we analyzed
the capacity of the MK2206 AKT inhibitor to modulate glucocorticoid induced translocation
of NR3C1 to the nucleus in T-ALL cells. CCRF-CEM and MOLT3, two PTEN null,
glucocorticoid resistant T-ALL cell lines expressing high levels of AKT activation, showed

cytoplasmic localization of NR3C1 in basal conditions, which was only partially relocalized
to the nucleus upon dexamethasone treatment (Figure 2E, Figure S2B). Inhibition of AKT
with MK2206 effectively enhanced glucocorticoid-induced translocation of the NR3C1
protein to the nucleus in these cells (Figure 2E, Figure S2). Notably, similar results were
obtained in primograft T-ALL lymphoblasts in which inhibition of AKT with MK2206
increased the nuclear translocation of the NR3C1 protein following glucocorticoid treatment
(Figure 2F).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Transcriptionally, MYR-AKT1 impaired the capacity of NR3C1 to activate a luciferase
reporter construct under the control of a synthetic glucocorticoid response element (Figure
3A). Consistently, AKT activation via MYR-AKT1 expression or PTEN knockdown in
DND41 and KOPTK1 T-ALL cells impaired key effector responses mediating
glucocorticoid induced cell death including glucocorticoid receptor autoupregulation (Geng
et al., 2008) and induction of BCL2L11, a proapototic factor essential for glucocorticoid
induced cell death (Wang et al., 2003) (Figure 3B,C; Figure S3A,B). Consistently,
glucorticoid induced apoptosis was significantly blunted in DND41 and KOPTK1 MYRAKT expressing cells compared with controls (Figure S3C). To better analyze the potential
impact of mutational loss of PTEN in T-ALL on the global transcriptional program induced
by glucocorticoids, we performed microarray gene expression analysis of DND41 shRNA
control and PTEN shRNA knockdown cells treated with dexamethasone. In agreement with
a global inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor activity by AKT, microarray analysis of gene
expression changes induced by dexamethasone treatment showed complete abrogation of
glucocorticoid induced signatures upon activation of AKT1 via PTEN shRNA knockdown
(Figure 3D). Moreover, GSEA analysis of genes regulated by glucocorticoids in primary
leukemia samples (Schmidt et al., 2006) showed a marked enrichment in DND41 control
cells treated with dexamethasone compared with dexamethasone-treated PTEN shRNA
knockdown samples (Figure 3E).
Pharmacologic inhibition of AKT reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test the therapeutic role of AKT inhibition in the treatment of glucocorticoid resistant
leukemias we first treated CCRF-CEM cells a PTEN-null glucocorticoid resistant T-ALL
cell line with dexamethasone and MK2206. In these experiments AKT1 inhibition of CCRFCEM lymphoblasts with MK2206 effectively restored glucocorticoid induced apoptosis and
reversed glucocorticoid resistance in vitro (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained in the
glucocorticoid resistant MOLT3 and PF382 T-ALL cell lines (Figure S4A). Analysis of an
extended panel of cell lines including B precursor ALL (Figure S4B), diffuse large B cell
lymphoma (Figure S4C) and multiple myeloma (Figure S4D) lines showed additive effects
with this combination, suggesting that the synergistic interaction between glucocorticoids
and AKT inhibition may be most prominently relevant in the context of T-ALL.
Next we analyzed the effects of MK2206 and glucocorticoid in vivo in a xenograft model of
glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL. CCRF-CEM cells expressing the luciferase gene were
injected intravenously in immunodeficient NOG mice and tumor engraftment was assessed
by in vivo bioimaging at day 18. Animals harboring homogeneous tumor burdens were
treated with vehicle only (DMSO), MK2206, dexamethasone or MK2206 plus
dexamethasone for 3 days. In this experiment, animals treated with dexamethasone or
MK2206 showed progressive tumor growth similar to that observed in vehicle-treated
controls, while mice treated with MK2206 plus dexamethasone had significant antitumor
responses (Figure 4B). Following these results we evaluated the response to the combination
treatment MK2206 plus dexamethasone in primary T-ALL lymphoblasts. Towards this goal
we established viable in vitro cultures of T-ALL leukemia primograft samples supported by
bone marrow MS5 stroma cells expressing the Delta like 1 NOTCH1 ligand (Armstrong et

al., 2009). Treatment of T-ALL leukemia cultures with MK2206 plus dexamethasone in
combination showed significantly increased antileukemic effects compared with treatment
with dexamethasone or MK2206 alone (Figure 4C,D and Figure S4E). Notably, the
antileukemic effects of MK2206 plus dexamethasone were prominent in tumor samples with
PTEN loss (TALL#6, TALL#9 and T-ALL#28), but were also realized in PTEN-expressing
tumors with moderate levels of AKT1 activation (T-ALL #19, TALL#37 and T-ALL#39)
(Figure S4F).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further test the efficacy of this treatment combination in vivo we established leukemia
xenografts in NOD rag gamma immunodeficient mice using three independent
glucocorticoid resistant primograft T-ALL samples infected with lentiviruses expressing the
luciferase gene. Animals harboring homogeneous tumor burdens by in vivo bioimaging were
treated with vehicle only (DMSO), MK2206, dexamethasone or MK2206 plus
dexamethasone. In this experiment, mice treated with dexamethasone or MK2206 showed
progressive tumor growth similar to that observed in vehicle-treated controls, while mice
treated with MK2206 plus dexamethasone showed significant antitumor responses (Figure
5). In these experiments analysis of AKT1 phosphorylation showed effective suppression of
AKT1 signaling in mice treated with MK2206 and MK2206 plus dexamethasone in vivo
(Figure S5A, B). Moreover, expression analysis of the TSC22D3 (GILZ) glucocorticoid
receptor target (Ayroldi et al., 2007; D’Adamio et al., 1997; Riccardi et al., 1999) and
PARP-1 cleavage, showed increased glucocorticoid response and enhanced apoptosis in
leukemia infiltrated tissues of mice treated with MK2206 plus dexamethasone in
combination, respectively (Figure S5A). Pharmacokinetic analysis of MK2206 and
dexamethasone ruled out that this effect could be mediated by decreased clearance of
dexamethasone as the pharmacokinetic profile of this glucocorticoid was identical in
animals treated with dexamethasone alone and mice treated with MK2206 plus
dexamethasone in combination (Figure S5C). In addition, even though we observed a
modest decrease in MK2206 half life in mice treated with dexamethasone plus MK2206
(Figure S5C), AKT inhibitor levels obtained in animals treated with MK2206 as single agent
already result in complete suppression of AKT activation in vivo (Figure S5A, B),
supporting that this pharmacokinetic interaction does not account for the increased
antileukemic responses observed in mice treated with dexamethasone plus MK2206.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally, we generated a mouse leukemia model in which glucocorticoid resistance is
specifically driven by genetic loss of Pten using a well established retroviral transduction
and bone marrow transplantation protocol (Chiang et al., 2008). In this model,
transplantation of tamoxifen-inducible conditional Pten knockout
(ROSA26Cre-ERT2/+;Ptenf/f) hematopoietic progenitors infected with retroviruses expressing
a mutant constitutively active form of the NOTCH1 receptor (NOTCH1 L1601P ΔPEST)
resulted in the development of NOTCH1 driven T-ALL tumors as previously described
(Chiang et al., 2008). Next we infected NOTCH1;ROSA26Cre-ERT2/+;Ptenf/f T-ALL
lymphoblasts with a luciferase expressing retrovirus and transplanted them into secondary
recipients which were treated with vehicle only or tamoxifen in order to generate Pten-nondeleted and Pten-deleted isogenic tumors, respectively. Treatment of Pten-non-deleted
tumor bearing mice with dexamethasone showed a significant improvement in survival
compared with vehicle only treated controls (Figure 6A). In contrast, and consistent with a
role of Pten loss and AKT1 activation in promoting glucocorticoid resistance, all mice
harboring Pten-deleted tumors failed to respond to dexamethasone treatment and showed no
survival differences compared to vehicle treated controls (Figure 6B).
To test the efficacy of MK2206 and glucocorticoids in combination we treated mice
transplanted with NOTCH1-induced Pten-deleted murine tumors expressing luciferase in
secondary recipients, with vehicle only (DMSO), MK2206, dexamethasone or MK2206 plus

dexamethasone and monitored their response to therapy by in vivo bioimaging. Animals
treated with dexamethasone or MK2206 in this experiment showed progressive tumor
growth similar to that observed in vehicle-treated controls while mice treated with MK2206
plus dexamethasone showed significant antitumor responses (Figure 6C,D), which translated
in significantly improved survival in this group (Figure 6E). As before, analysis of AKT1
phosphorylation showed effective suppression of AKT1 signaling in mice treated with
MK2206 and MK2206 plus dexamethasone in vivo (Figure S6A), while GILZ expression
analysis showed increased glucocorticoid response (Figure S6A) and PARP-1 cleavage
demonstrated increased apoptosis in tumor cells from animals treated with MK2206 plus
dexamethasone in combination (Figure S6A). Consistently, histological analysis of leukemia
infiltrated bone marrow showed increased antileukemic effects (Figure S6B) and marked
increased apoptosis (Figure S6C) in mice xenografted with NOTCH1-induced Pten−/− TALL cells treated with MK2206 plus dexamethasone in combination.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally, we analyzed the role of NR3C1 S134 phosphorylation in the therapeutic response to
glucocorticoids and the effects of Pten loss in glucocorticoid therapy in this model.
Retroviral expression of the glucocorticoid receptor enhanced the response of NOTCH1induced Pten non-deleted leukemias to glucocorticoid treatment; an effect that was
effectively abrogated upon Pten loss (Figures 6F and S6D). In contrast, expression of the
AKT-resistant NR3C1 S134A mutant protein was equally effective at increasing the
antileukemic effects of glucocorticoids in Pten non-deleted and Pten null lymphoblasts
(Figures 6G and S6D). Overall, these results support that pharmacologic inhibition of AKT
can effectively enhance glucocorticoid response and reverse glucocorticoid resistance in TALL.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the lack of effective glucocorticoid
induced apoptosis in prednisone poor responders (Bhadri et al., 2012). However, and despite
much research over the last two decades, the molecular basis of primary glucocorticoid
resistance in ALL remain poorly understood. Given that primary glucocorticoid resistance is
a cell intrinsic property of leukemia lymphoblasts present before exposure to glucocorticoid
therapy, we proposed that primary oncogenic signaling pathways involved in leukemia
transformation could also function as negative upstream regulators of the glucocorticoid
receptor driving this phenotype. The identification of AKT1 as a driver of glucocorticoid
resistance in T-ALL is perfectly consistent with this model. Notably, direct activation of
AKT1 can drive T-cell transformation (Kharas et al., 2010); activation of PI3K-AKT
signaling as result of deletions and mutations in PTEN (Palomero et al., 2007) is highly
prevalent in T-ALL; and PTEN mutations are associated with primary glucocorticoid
resistance in the clinic (Bandapalli et al., 2013).
Mechanistically, we show that AKT1 can induce glucocorticoid resistance by
phosphorylation of the glucocorticoid receptor in position S134, which impairs the nuclear
relocalization of the glucocorticoid receptor protein and blocks transcriptional regulation of
glucocorticoid target genes. However, it should be noted that additional mechanisms
downstream of AKT1 in addition to direct inactivation of the glucocorticoid receptor can
also promote resistance to glucocorticoid therapy by promoting cell growth, metabolism and
survival in T-ALL. In this regard, mTOR phosphorylation by AKT impairs glucocorticoid
induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of MCL1 (Wei et al., 2006). In addition,
AKT phosphorylation inhibits BAD mediated apoptosis (Bornhauser et al., 2007; Datta et
al., 1997; del Peso et al., 1997); AKT-mediated phosphorylation of XIAP prevents the
autoubiquitination and subsequent degradation of this antiapoptotic factor (Bornhauser et al.,
2007; Dan et al., 2004); and increased metabolism induced by AKT activation can

antagonize metabolic inhibition induced by glucocorticoids (Beesley et al., 2009). The
convergent effects of direct (shown here) and indirect mechanisms downstream of AKT1
antagonizing the antileukemic effects of glucocorticoids further support the role of the
PI3K-AKT pathway as therapeutic target for the reversal of primary glucocorticoid
resistance in T-ALL.

(SABiosciences).
Microarray Expression Analysis of Glucocorticoid response
DND41 shRNA LUC and DND41 PTEN shRNA cell were treated with vehicle only
(DMSO) or dexamethasone (1μM) for 24 hours in triplicate. RNA was isolated, labeled and
hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) using standard

upon dexamethasone treatment with a fold change > 2 were selected by t-test.
Glucocorticoid regulated transcripts (t-test p<0.01 and fold change >1.25) in primary ALL
were identified from processed expression data obtained from peripheral blood lymphoblasts
from 13 pediatric ALL patients after 24 hours of treatment with glucocorticoids (Schmidt et
al., 2006). Enrichment of these glucocorticoid signature genes in shRNA PTEN vs shRNA
LUC dexamethasone treated samples normalized to DMSO controls was analyzed by GSEA
using the t-test metric comparing and 1,000 permutations of the genes.
Mice

Animal procedures were approved by the Columbia University IACUC. ROSA26Cre-ERT2/+
mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible form of the Cre recombinase from the ubiquitous
Rosa26 locus (Guo et al., 2007) and Pten conditional knockout mice (Ptenf) have been
previously described (Trotman et al., 2003). To generate NOTCH1-induced T-ALL tumors
in mice we performed retroviral transduction of bone marrow cells with an activated form of
the NOTCH1 oncogene (NOTCH1 L1601P ΔPEST) and transplanted them via intravenous
injection into lethally irradiated recipients as previously described (Chiang et al., 2008).
Primary human T-ALL xenografts experiments were generated via intravenous injection of

and therapy response by in vivo bioimaging with the In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS,
Xenogen), human CD45 analysis by flow cytometry and analysis of luciferase activity in
bone marrow and spleen.
Statistical Analyses
We performed statistical analysis by Student’s t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We
considered results with p<0.05 as statistically significant. Survival in animal experiments

SIGNIFICANCE

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Improving the outcomes of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) will
require the identification of specific molecular mechanisms driving resistance to therapy
and developing new pharmacologic strategies to neutralize them. Primary resistance to
glucocorticoids, defined as failure to achieve robust cytoreduction after a week of
glucocorticoid therapy, is of particular importance as it is associated with very poor
prognosis. Here we show that AKT1 can drive resistance to glucocorticoids via direct
inhibition of the glucocorticoid receptor. Consistently, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT
effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance. These results highlight the potential role of
AKT1 as therapeutic target in the treatment of glucocorticoid resistant T-ALL.
