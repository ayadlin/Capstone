BACKGROUND. New systemic therapies are needed to improve the prognosis of
patients with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In a Phase II trial
involving previously untreated patients with advanced HCC, the more favorable
schedule from a previous pilot study was evaluated.

METHODS. Thirty-four patients with previously untreated advanced-stage HCC
were prospectively enrolled. The GEMOX regimen consisted of gemcitabine 1000
mg/m2 on Day 1 and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 on Day 2. The treatment was
repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or limiting toxicity.

RESULTS. Thirty-two patients were assessable for efficacy and 33 for toxicity. In
all, 323 treatment cycles were administered. No toxic deaths occurred. Hematological grade 3-4 toxicity consisted of thrombocytopenia (27% of patients) and neutropenia (24%), including 2 febrile neutropenia and anemia (9%). Grade 3
oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity was observed in 3 (9%) patients. The overall
response rate was 18% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-34) and disease stabilization was observed in 58% of patients (including 5 minor responses), giving a disease control rate of 76%. Median progression-free and overall survival times
were, respectively, 6.3 months (95% CI: 4.3-10.1 months) and 11.5 months (95%
CI: 8.5-14.3 months). Treatment was significantly more effective in patients with
nonalcoholic cirrhosis than in those with alcoholic cirrhosis.

CONCLUSIONS. The GEMOX regimen seems to be well tolerated and active in
advanced HCC, especially in patients with underlying nonalcoholic liver disease.

epatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide. Its incidence has doubled over the last 20
years in Europe,1 and 667,000 cases of HCC were expected worldwide in 2005.1,2
In 80% of cases HCC occurs in patients with cirrhosis. The overall survival rate at 5 years is no better than 5% among patients with
advanced-stage disease. Potential curative treatments are orthotopic
liver transplantation, complete surgical resection, and percutaneous
ablation, but such treatments are feasible in only 20% to 25% of
patients, mainly owing to early dissemination.3 There is no consensus on the treatment of patients with advanced-stage HCC. Locoregional approaches (embolization, intra-arterial chemotherapy, and
chemoembolization) and systemic treatments (interferon, hormone
therapy, and chemotherapy) offered a marginal survival benefit in

most clinical trials.3 New drugs are therefore needed
to improve the survival of patients with advanced
HCC.
Cell exposure to gemcitabine followed by oxaliplatin (the GEMOX regimen) has a potent antiproliferative effect in vitro.4 The GEMOX regimen was
subsequently evaluated as a treatment for several
cancers, including pancreatic carcinoma,5 biliary
tract adenocarcinoma,6 germ cell tumors,7 transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract,8 ovarian
carcinoma, and nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma,9 with
good activity and tolerability.
The lack of renal and hepatic toxicity make the
GEMOX combination particularly attractive for treating HCC patients with underlying cirrhosis in most
cases. We previously reported the results of a pilot
study comparing 2 bimonthly GEMOX schedules.10
Twenty-one patients with advanced HCC, 76% of
whom had already been treated, received either a
schedule with gemcitabine 1.5 g/m2 followed by oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, or a schedule with gemcitabine 1
g/m2 on Day 1 and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 on Day 2.
In the entire population the objective response rate
and the disease control rate were, respectively, 19%
and 66%, and the median progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) times were 5 and 12
months, respectively. However, the latter schedule
(gemcitabine 1 g/m2 on Day 1 and oxaliplatin 100
mg/m2 on Day 2) seemed more effective, with a
response rate of 30% compared with 10% with the
other schedule, and better tolerated, with grade 3-4
hematological toxicity in 18% of patients, compared
with 70% with the other schedule. Although the comparison of these 2 schedules was performed on a
limited number of patients and did not allow determination of the respective impact of dosing and
scheduling on the observed results, we tested here
the gemcitabine 1 g/m2 on Day 1 and oxaliplatin 100
mg/m2 on Day 2 regimen in a 2-center Phase II trial
involving previously untreated patients with advancedstage HCC.

central nervous system metastasis; no history of peripheral sensory neuropathy; and initial evaluation
<3 weeks before therapy. Between May 2002 and
September 2004, all patients with advanced HCC
who were referred to the 2 participating institutions
(Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, and Gustave
Roussy Institute in Villejuif, France) for medical
treatment were considered for this study. Written
informed consent was obtained from all the patients
and the study was approved by the Pitie Salpetriere
Ethics Committee. Body weight, performance status,
and clinical manifestations (eg, ascites, pain, asthenia, and loss of appetite) were recorded before the
outset of therapy. The pretreatment evaluation
included a physical examination, AFP assay, abdominal CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
chest radiography or CT as required.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Treatment Schedule
Treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 as a
fixed-dose-rate intravenous infusion at 10 mg/m2/
min on Day 1 followed by oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 as
a 2-hour infusion on Day 2, as previously described.10 The treatment was repeated every 2 weeks
until disease progression, limiting toxicity, or patient
refusal to continue. HBsAg-positive patients were
treated with lamivudine 100 mg/day before the first
GEMOX cycle to prevent severe hepatitis B (HBV)
during chemotherapy. Antiemetic prophylaxis was
given systematically (5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonists and steroids). If National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) grade 3-4 nonneurosensory toxicity occurred, then the subsequent
cycle was postponed until recovery; the gemcitabine
dose was then reduced to 800 mg/m2 and the oxaliplatin dose to 85 mg/m2. If characteristic grade 3
(oxaliplatin-specific scale)11 cumulative sensory peripheral neuropathy occurred, then oxaliplatin was
discontinued and gemcitabine was administered
alone as initially scheduled. Treatment was discontinued in patients with progressive disease (PD) or
repeated grade 3-4 toxicity, or if the patient refused
to continue. Second-line treatment was permitted if
the investigator considered it justified.

Patients
Patients were eligible for the study if they met the
following criteria: advanced pathologically proven
HCC or an alpha-feto-protein (AFP) level over 400
ng/mL associated with cirrhosis and a liver tumor on
computed tomography (CT) scan; WHO performance
status of 0, 1, or 2; age 18 years; measurable disease; adequate renal and hematologic function (neutrophil count >1.5 3 109/L, platelet count >100 3
109/L); compensated Child stage A or B cirrhosis; no

Assessment of Responses
The response to treatment was evaluated every 4
cycles by means of helicoidal CT or MRI, or earlier if
there were clinical signs of progression. WHO criteria12 were used to define responses and their duration: a complete response (CR) was defined as
complete disappearance of all assessable disease; a
partial response (PR) was defined as a decrease of at
least 50% in the sum of the products of the 2 largest

1386

perpendicular diameters of measurable lesions, lasting at least 4 weeks; stable disease (SD) was defined
as a decrease of less than 50% or an increase of less
than 25% in tumor size; progressive disease (PD) was
defined as a greater than 25% increase in the sum of
the products of 2 perpendicular diameters of at least
1 tumor, or the appearance of a new lesion. Objective responses were confirmed by a second evaluation 4 to 8 weeks later. Minor responses (MR) were
defined as a decrease of more than 25% but less
than 50% in the sum of the products of 2 perpendicular diameters of target lesions.
AFP levels were determined every 2 months.
Body weight, performance status, and symptoms
were recorded before each cycle.

Assessment of Toxicity
Toxicity was evaluated with the NCI-CTC system
V2.0. The oxaliplatin-specific scale was used to assess
oxaliplatin neurotoxicity.11 Complete blood cell
counts (including platelets) were performed every
week to assess hematologic toxicity. Physical examinations, full blood counts, and serum bilirubin
assays were performed before each cycle. Patients
were specifically questioned about nausea and
vomiting, mucositis, diarrhea, malaise, appetite, and
neurotoxicity. All patients who received at least 1
course of chemotherapy were evaluated for toxicity.

Statistical Analysis
The endpoint of this Phase II trial was the overall
response rate to the GEMOX regimen. The study
used the Simon 2-stage design.13 The sample size
was calculated to reject a 10% response rate in favor
of a target response rate of 30%, with a significance
level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. In the initial stage
a total of 12 assessable patients were to be entered
and evaluated for response. If there was 1 response,
accrual was to be terminated. If >1 response was
observed in the first stage, then 20 additional
patients were to enter the second stage to achieve a
total of at least 32 assessable patients. Further
assessment of the regimen was felt to be warranted
if 6 responses were observed in the 32 patients.
Results are expressed as means standard deviation or
range, as appropriate. Follow-up started from the
outset of treatment. The censoring event for responses was the start of disease progression. The
censoring event for survival was the date of death.
Survival curves were plotted with NCSS 2001 software
(Number Cruncher Statistical Systems, Kaysville, UT)
using the Kaplan-Meier method.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the Patients
Between May 2002 and September 2004, 34 patients
with advanced-stage HCC were enrolled in the study.
Patients’ baseline characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. Thirteen patients had underlying alcoholic
liver disease (OH subgroup), and 21 had underlying
nonalcoholic liver disease (non-OH subgroup). A
pathological proof of the HCC was available in 18
patients, the Barcelona Conference Criteria were met
for the 16 other patients.3 Twelve patients had had
local treatment for HCC. Respectively, 5, 3, and 1
patients had curative, palliative, and exploratory abdominal surgery. One patient had had radiofrequency
ablation. Two patients had had chemoembolization.
All these patients had recurrences or progressive disease 6 to 12 months later.

Responses and Survival
Thirty-two patients were assessable for efficacy. One
patient died of sepsis, without neutropenia, 5 days
after the third chemotherapy course, before being
evaluated, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up after
the first treatment cycle. The overall response rate
was 18% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-34) (n ¼ 6)
and the stabilization rate was 58% (including 5 minor
responses), giving a disease control rate of 76%. Two
patients underwent secondary resection of their tumor remnant. The responses lasted from 4 to 33
months (median, 8 months). The median PFS was
6.3 months (95% CI: 4.3-10.1 months), and the median OS was 11.5 months (95% CI: 8.5-14.3 months)
(Fig. 1). The 1-year survival rate was 44% (95% CI:
29%-66%). Among the 25 patients with elevated AFP
levels at baseline (>400 ng/mL), the level fell by
more than 50% during therapy in 15 patients (60%).
Moreover, 12 of the 26 patients with an initial WHO
performance status 1 (46%) improved during therapy. In the OH and non-OH subgroups the partial
response rates were, respectively, 0% (95% CI: 0-26)
and 29% (95% CI: 14-50); the median PFS time was 6
(95% CI: 2-7) and 8 (95% CI: 4-12) months, and the
median OS time was 10 (95% CI: 6-15) vs 13 (95% CI:
7-16) months (Table 2).

Toxicity
A total of 322 GEMOX cycles were administered, with
a median of 8 cycles per patient (range, 1-24 cycles)
(Table 3). Thirty-three patients were assessable for
toxicity. No toxic deaths occurred. Grade 3-4 toxicity
occurred in 14 patients (42%). Hematologic toxicity

1387

was the most common severe toxicity and consisted
of thrombocytopenia (27%; no bleeding events), neutropenia (24%; febrile in 2 cases), and anemia (9%)
(Table 3). Grade 3 neurotoxicity was the most common severe nonhematologic toxicity, affecting 3
patients (9%), whereas grades 1 and 2 neurotoxicity
occurred in 19 (58%) and 7 (21%) patients, respectively. Two grade 3 (6%), 5 (15%) grade 2, and 14
grade 1 (42%) asthenia were also reported. No other
grade 3-4 toxicity was observed. No episodes of clinical or biological hepatic failure occurred. Overall,
dose reductions of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, or both
drugs were necessary in 15 patients (44%) for severe
and/or delayed hematotoxicity. Oxaliplatin discontinuation was necessary in 4 patients, for grade 3 neurotoxicity in 3 cases and allergy in 1. The delivered
relative dose-intensity per patient was 81% for oxaliplatin and 89% for gemcitabine.
The toxicity profile in the OH and non-OH subgroups was similar, except that grade 3 neurotoxicity
occurred in, respectively, 25% and 0% of patients
(Table 2).

Additional Treatments
Ten patients received additional treatments. Two
patients had curative resection of HCC after 1 partial
response and 1 minor response to GEMOX; the first
patient is still alive more than 3.5 years after the beginning of GEMOX therapy, and the second patient
was lost to follow-up 1 year after surgery. One
patient had chemoembolization, 1 received gemcitabine plus doxorubicin, and 1 received celecoxib;
capecitabine, octreotid, and tamoxifen were each
administered to 2 patients.

DISCUSSION
There is no agreed palliative treatment for patients
with advanced-stage HCC. After 4 randomized trials
with negative results,14–17 transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was shown to improve survival in 2
recent trials.18,19 However, the patients enrolled in
those trials were highly selected, as they had no extrahepatic dissemination, no portal vein thrombosis,
and no significant alteration of their liver function
(Child A cirrhosis). Altogether, TACE is appropriate
for only about 10% of patients.
The overall response rate to systemic chemotherapy is generally less than 10%,20 probably owing to
the strong multidrug-resistance gene expression usually observed in this setting.21,22 Doxorubicin has
been widely evaluated in patients with advancedstage HCC, either alone23 or in combination.20 The
combination of cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil,

and alpha-IFN (PIAF) has been assessed in 50
patients. The overall response rate was 26%, but considerable hematological toxicity and 2 treatmentrelated deaths occurred.24 Other anthracycline-based
polychemotherapy regimens appear ineffective and
poorly tolerated in cirrhotic patients.25 In the past 15
years about 10 new chemotherapeutic agents have
become available, leading to major advances in the
medical treatment of several gastrointestinal (GI)
tract cancers such as pancreatic and colonic adenocarcinomas. However, recent clinical trials of irinotecan,26,27 taxanes,28–30 gemcitabine,31–35 topotecan,36,37
and thymidilate synthase inhibitors38,39 have all given
disappointing results in advanced-stage HCC. New
targeted antitumoral therapies have been tested in
HCC patients over the past 2 years; most reported
results are preliminary and need to be confirmed.
Anti-EGF-R monotherapy, using either tyrosine kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies, has so far
given disappointing results, with a response rate of
less than 10% and a median PFS of less than 5
months.40,41 However, anti-EGF-R therapies have
never been tested in combination with chemotherapy in this setting. Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF
monoclonal antibody, has been tested both alone

and in combination with chemotherapy in patients
with advanced-stage HCC. Bevacizumab monotherapy appears safe in carefully selected patients, but
shows modest clinical efficacy.42 It has also been
tested in combination with the GEMOX regimen in
33 patients (among which 30 were evaluable for efficacy) with advanced disease.43 The combination was
also safe, but the response rates and survival times
were similar to those obtained with the GEMOX regimen alone in the present work, although it is difficult
to compare 2 Phase II studies. A trial comparing this
combination therapy to the GEMOX regimen alone
will be performed to determine if bevacizumab is
beneficial or not.
With an overall response rate of 18% and a disease control rate of 76%, the GEMOX regimen compares favorably with other systemic therapies for
HCC. This palliative chemotherapy thus achieves the
purpose of stabilizing the disease. The interpretation
of the disease control rate may be biased by the fact
that some HCC tumors are slow-growing. Thus, disease stability based on bimonthly morphological evaluation with the WHO criteria may in fact
correspond to the natural course of the disease.
Documented disease progression during the 2-3
months before enrollment would have helped to
confirm that the observed stabilization was really
due to the experimental treatment. However, respectively 65% and 50% of the patients remained stable
at 4 and 6 months. GEMOX thus seems capable of
achieving durable stabilization of advanced-stage
HCC. This is very encouraging, despite the modest
overall response rate. Nevertheless, tumor response
remains an important endpoint in HCC treatment, as
it can lead to secondary curative surgical resection of
the tumor in some patients. Thus, new combinations
including the GEMOX schedule together with new
antitumor treatments will be tested.
When looking for predictive factors for treatment
response, we observed that all the objective
responses occurred in patients with nonalcoholic
underlying liver disease. In this subgroup the overall
response rate was 29%. OS and PFS were also better
in nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients. The poor treat-

GEMOX in Advanced HCC/Louafi et al.

ment efficacy in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis
may be due to differences between the damage
caused to the liver parenchyma by alcohol and by viral infection or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.44,45
Alcohol-induced liver disease might limit drug diffusion into the tumor bed. Such differences in treatment activity have been described in trials of TACE
for HCC. Among the 6 controlled randomized trials
of TACE vs symptomatic treatment or tamoxifen,14–19
only the last 2, in which more than 80% of patients
had viral cirrhosis, showed a significant increase in
survival.18,19
Regarding the toxicity of the GEMOX combination in GI malignancies, most data come from a
Phase III study reported by Louvet et al,5 in which
the same GEMOX schedule was compared with gemcitabine alone in 313 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: among the 157 patients in the GEMOX
arm the most frequent grade 3-4 toxicities (per
patient) were neutropenia (20.4%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (19.1%), and thrombocytopenia
(14%).
In our trial, involving patients with HCC and
underlying cirrhosis, the toxicity profile was also acceptable. The most significant adverse event was
thrombocytopenia. This could have been particularly
troublesome in patients with portal hypertension
and baseline platelet counts under 150 G/L, and a
risk of bleeding from esophageal varices, yet no
bleeding episodes and no grade 4 thrombocytopenia
occurred, possibly owing to close monitoring and
dose adjustment. It is important to note that the
study population was almost entirely Child-Pugh
Class A; this may in part account for the favorable
tolerability results observed. Likewise, no HBV reactivation was observed, possibly due to routine
lamivudin prophylaxis in HBsAg-positive patients.
Tolerability was similar in the patients with alcoholic
and nonalcoholic cirrhosis, except that grade 3 neurotoxicity was more frequent in alcoholic patients, in
whom underlying latent alcoholic neuropathy is
common. Altogether, the GEMOX regimen was safe
and well tolerated in this population of cirrhotic
patients with advanced-stage HCC.
In conclusion, in terms of the disease control
rate and toxicity profile, the GEMOX regimen compares favorably with other chemotherapy regimens
used to treat HCC patients with good performance
status and adequate liver function. The etiology of
the underlying liver disease appears to be predictive
of treatment efficacy. In order to increase the objective response rate, the GEMOX regimen is currently
being tested in combination with cetuximab in a multicenter Phase II trial involving previously untreated

1389

patients with advanced-stage HCC and documented
disease progression.
