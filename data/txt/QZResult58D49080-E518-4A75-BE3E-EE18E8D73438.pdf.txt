ABSTRACT:
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is notorious for its high invasiveness and
metastatic ability. In this study, we identified a differential hypermethylated
transcription repressor, Homeobox A2 (HOXA2), which may render NPC cells invasive
and metastatic. Aberrant hypermethylation of HOXA2 led to low RNA expression in
NPC tumors and cells. Addition of methylation inhibitor 5’Aza restored HOXA2 RNA
expression in NPC cells. Methylated HOXA2 promoter reduces the binding affinity of
the transcriptional co-activator p300, causing transcriptional repression of HOXA2.
In NPC cells, re-expression of ectopic HOXA2 was correlated with decreased invasive
ability and reduced metalloproteinase MMP-9 RNA and protein expression. Promoter,
ChIP and DNA-pull down assays indicated that HOXA2 competes with the transcription
activator, TATA-box binding protein (TBP) for a recognition sequence near the MMP9 transcription start site, and suppresses MMP-9 transcription. Thus, HOXA2 acts
as a suppressor or TBP-antagonist to inhibit MMP-9 expression; while methylationmediated inactivation of HOXA2 in NPC derepresses MMP-9 production and increases
invasion of NPC cells. In NPC plasma samples, increased plasma EBV copy number was
correlated with increased in cell-free HOXA2 hypermethylation and elevated MMP-9
levels. Plasma EBV DNA and methylated cell-free HOXA2 can be used as biomarkers
for monitoring NPC treatment.

INTRODUCTION

1 (DNMT1) and causes aberrant cellular DNA
hypermethylation, leading to inactivation of the adhesion
molecule, E-cadherin [5, 6]. This indicates that the viral
protein can silence gene via hypermethylation and promote
NPC tumor progression. DNA methylation is essential for
normal development, gene imprinting and X chromosome
inactivation [7, 8]. However, aberrant DNA methylation
has been associated with tumor suppressor gene (TSG)
inactivation and tumorigenesis in many cancers [9]. We
characterized differentially hypermethylated genes in NPC

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common
head and neck cancer in Southeast Asia [1]. Diet, genetic
background and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) type II latent
infection are strongly associated with NPC [2, 3]. A
viral oncoprotein expressed during latent EBV infection,
latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), is considered to be
a key factor in NPC development [4]. Previously, we
demonstrated that LMP1 activates DNA methyltransferase

tumors and identified that the Homeobox A2 (HOXA2)
gene is hypermethylated and down-regulated at the RNA
level. There are 39 HOX genes comprising four different
chromosomal clusters A~D in human. The HOX proteins
are highly conserved transcription factors that share a
similar DNA-binding domain called the homeodomain
[10]. The HOX genes are conserved among species and
are important for body segment patterning [11, 12].
HOXA2 protein may suppress gene expression through
the HOXA2-response element [13, 14]. The biological
significance of HOXA2 hypermethylation in NPC cells
will be discussed.

Differentially methylated HOXA2 correlates with
low mRNA expression in NPC biopsies and cell
lines
To identify genes that were differentially methylated
in NPC, we isolated genomic DNA from 4 tumor and
non-tumor (T-N) paired NPC biopsies and analyzed the
samples on TranSignal Methylation Promoter Arrays

Figure 1: Identification of the HOXA2 gene as differentially methylated in NPC. (A) Three fragments covering the 61 CpG

sites in the HOXA2 promoter (-1492~+17) were amplified from 8 paired NPC samples and analyzed by MassArray (Sequenom®). The
colored histogram represents the CpG methylation ratio, ranging from 0 (0% methylated CpG site, red) to 1.0 (100% methylated CpG
site, yellow). Each horizontal lane denotes the methylation ratio of a given CpG site in NPC tumor and adjacent normal tissues. The right
panel shows the averaged methylation ratio of each sample. (B) Schematic map containing a CpG island (-345~-205, diagonal region) of
the HOXA2 promoter, as adapted from the MethPrimer website [15]. The transcription start site (+1) and 22 CpG sites (vertical bars) are

single clone; the methylation percentages of at least 8 individual clones are indicated, with unmethylated (○) and methylated (●) CpG sites.
The lower panel shows the methylation percentage for each sample. (C) Q-RT-PCR analysis of HOXA2 mRNA expression was performed
on the 8-paired NPC samples, and the results were normalized with respect to GAPDH expression. The columns represent the relative

overall methylation ratio (the average of all tumors or nontumors) for the 8 NPC tumors was 0.45, whereas that of
the adjacent normal counterparts was 0.14 (Fig. 1A; lower
panel). Therefore, the overall fold-change of the average
methylation ratios of the tumor and non-tumor samples
was 3.3 (***, p < 0.001), suggesting that the HOXA2
promoter is hypermethylated in NPC tumors.
To identify which CpG sites of the HOXA2 promoter
are differentially methylated in NPC samples and cell
lines, we performed bisulfite sequencing. MethPrimer
web-based prediction [15] indicated that there was one
CpG island (-345~-205) located near the transcription
start site (TSS, +1) of HOXA2 promoter region (Fig. 1B).
Our bisulfite sequencing results indicated that -443~+83 of
which contained the CpG island was hypermethylated in
the NPC cells (85.8% in HK1 and 94.8% in C666.1). As
shown in Fig. 1B, the methylation percentage of the same
HOXA2 region was high in five clinical tumor samples
(66.8~81%, average 74%) compared with their adjacent
normal tissues (6.8~50.5%, average 25%).

(Panomics). Among the tested 82 promoters, HOXA2
was found to be hypermethylated in NPC compared with
normal adjacent tissues. In three of the four cases, the
HOXA2 promoter hybridization signal in NPC tumors was
stronger than that in the non-tumor counterparts (Fig. S1;
left panel), indicating the amount of methylated HOXA2
DNA was comparatively higher in tumors. In contrast,
the promoter hybridization signal for the IRF7 gene (as
negative control) was similar between tumor and nontumor samples (Fig. S1; right panel).
To confirm that the HOXA2 promoter is
hypermethylated in NPC, we used MassARRAY mass
spectrometry (Sequenom) to quantify the HOXA2
methylation status in 8 T-N paired NPC biopsies
(Supplementary MassARRAY methylation ratio). The
MassARRAY methylation profile heat map for the 8 T-N
paired NPC samples comprised 61 CpG units (-1421~+17)
(Fig. 1A; upper panel). NPC tumors with high methylation
ratios or non-tumor tissues with low methylation ratios
grouped separately in unsupervised clustering. The

Three HOXA2 promoter deletion clones and two putative p300 binding sites (p300-1 and p300-2) are indicated. Different HOXA2 promoter
deletion clones were transfected into TW02 cells (left panel) or different HOXA2 promoter deletion clones and the pCMV/p300 expression
clone were co-transfected into 293T cells (right panel). Relative luciferase activities were detected 48hr post-transfection and all the
luciferase reporter activities were normalized with respect to renilla activity. The expression levels of p300 and actin (internal control) were
examined by Western blotting. (B) ChIP assays were performed with anti-p300 antibody or isotype IgG, using HK1 nuclear extracts treated
with or without 10μM 5’Aza. Q-PCR was used to amplify p300-1 (-171~-55), p300-2 (-435~-254), and a downstream region lacking a
p300 binding site (-110~+208). (C) DNA pull-down was used to analyze the binding affinity of exogenous Flag-tagged p300 (p300-3F) to
wild-type (WT), methylated (ME), mutated (MT) HOXA2 p300-1 and a three copies of p300 consensus (P) biotinylated probes. Anti-Flag
antibody was used to examine the amount of bound p300-3F in the immunoprecipitates and 5% inputs. Methylated cytosine is indicated by
“m” above C, and mutated sequences were underlined.

Based on this differentially methylated region
(DMR), we designed methylation-specific HOXA2
primers to quantify the methylation percentages of the
same NPC clinical samples by quantitative methylation
specific PCR (Q-MSP-PCR) analysis. As shown in Fig.
S2, strong MSP-PCR products can be detected in all NPC
tumors and a weak PCR product in one of the non-tumor
samples, indicating again the methylation percentage in
NPC tumors was higher than that of non-tumors. The
quantitative values of Q-MSP methylation percentage of
paired NPC tumor (T) and non-tumor (N) tissues were
indicated in Fig. S3A, (T: 31.2~87.9%, average 50.9%; N:
1.8~28.1%, average 6.7%). Thus, the results from three
different methylation-detecting assays all indicated that
HOXA2 was differentially hypermethylated in NPC tumor
tissues.
We then used quantitative (Q)-RT-PCR to evaluate
the HOXA2 mRNA levels in the same NPC tumor tissues,
and found that generally HOXA2 mRNA levels were
reduced 5-~210-fold (compared with the corresponding
adjacent normal tissues) in six out of the eight NPC
tumors (Fig. 1C). The relative quantitative values of

HOXA2 mRNA level of paired NPC tissues were indicated
in Fig. S3B. Our data also indicated that the HOXA2 DNA
methylation level (Q-MSP methylation %) was negatively
correlated with the relative RNA expression levels [-∆Ct=
-(CtHOXA2-CtGAPDH)] in NPC samples (Fig. S3C; correlation
r = -0.45). Furthermore, the HOXA2 mRNA levels in the
two NPC cells, C666.1 and HK1, could be restored by
addition of the demethylation agent, 5’Aza (Fig. 1D),
suggesting that DNA methylation was responsible for the
transcriptional repression of HOXA2 in NPC cells.

DNA methylation suppresses HOXA2 promoter
activity by impairing the binding of the
transcription activator, p300.
To determine whether DNA methylation per se
can silence HOXA2 promoter activity, we performed
patch methylation assays [16]. The HOXA2 promoter
was PCR-generated and in vitro methylated by the
methylase, SssI. Methylation was verified by digestion
with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, BstUI
(Fig. S4A). Methylated (pHOXA2me) and unmethylated

and (B) TW02 cells stably expressing HOXA2 and vector were analyzed. Migrated cells were counted from 10 different microscopic

independent experiments were performed in duplicate, and the results are shown as mean±SD (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, and *** p<0.001).

(pHOXA2un) promoters were inserted into a luciferase
reporter and separately transfected into 293T cells. The
results indicated that the pHOXA2me had only 33.4% of
the pHOXA2un promoter activity (Fig. S4B). This in vitro
result supports our observation in clinical NPC samples
that DNA methylation significantly suppresses HOXA2
promoter activity.
To test whether methylated CpG sites impair the
binding of transcription factors, we used TFSEARCH to
analyze transcription-factor-binding motifs in the HOXA2
promoter, focusing on the DMR identified by our bisulfite
sequencing analysis. One of the selected transcription
factors was p300, a transcriptional co-activator that
functions as a histone acetyltransferase and regulates
chromatin remodeling [17]. Two putative p300 binding
sites close to the TSS were identified in the HOXA2
promoter: p300-1 (-137) and p300-2 (-290). To examine
whether these p300 sites were crucial for HOXA2 promoter
activation, pHOXA2-Luc deletion reporters were generated
(Fig. 2A, upper panel) and transfected into TW02
cells (have high-level endogenous p300 expression).
Higher relative luciferase activity was detected from
pHOXA2(-171) 35.67-fold versus pHOXA2(-435) 17.33-

fold, and pHOXA2(-110) 19.23-fold (Fig. 2A, left panel),
suggesting that p300-1 is important for HOXA2 promoter
activity. Similar results were obtained when a p300
expression plasmid was co-transfected into 293T cells
(have low-level endogenous p300) along with the same
pHOXA2-Luc deletion reporters. The promoter activity
of pHOXA2(-171) was further activated 1.62-fold in
the presence of p300 (Fig. 2A, lower panel), while the
activities of the two other promoters were unaltered in the
presence of p300. Thus, our promoter assays indicate that
p300 activates the HOXA2 promoter mainly via the p3001 site.
To confirm whether the p300-binding affinity of the
HOXA promoter could be affected by DNA methylation,
we performed quantitative ChIP assays using p300
antibody and HK1 cells with or without 5’Aza treatment.
Our data showed that DNA demethylating agent, 5’Aza,
enhanced the binding of p300 to the p300-1 site (by 3.45fold) but not the p300-2 site (1.1-fold) on the HOXA2
promoter when compared with the untreated control cells
(Fig. 2B). These results indicate that p300 binds to the
p300-1 site but not to the p300-2 site.
Next, we used DNA pull-down experiments to test

MMP-9. (A) MMP-9 promoter deletion clones and the pCMV/HOXA2 expression vector or (B) mutated promoter MT (-205~+150)

and pCMV/HOXA2 or pCMV/TBP were co-transfected into HK1 and 293T cells, and luciferase reporter activity was detected. (C) In
vitro binding of HOXA2, TBP and RNA PolII on the MMP-9 promoter was determined by DNA pull-down assays. Biotinylated probes
containing the MMP-9 TATA box (-39~-15) or an upstream AT-rich region (-1421~-1397) were incubated with nuclear extracts from HK1
cells stably expressing vector or HOXA2. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of HOXA2, Flag-tagged HOXA2, TBP
and PolII in the immunoprecipitates and 5% inputs. (D) ChIP assays were performed with antibodies against HOXA2, Flag, TBP, PolII,
or isotype IgGs using nuclear extracts from HK1-expressing or control cells. Q-PCR was used to amplify the MMP-9 promoter TATA box
(-39~ -15). (A-E) The presented data reflect three independent experiments, and the results are shown as mean±SD (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01,

whether DNA methylation of two CpG sites on HOXA2
p300-1 site could affect the p300-binding affinity. We
synthesized double-stranded biotinylated oligomers
containing the p300-1 site with unmethylated (WT) or
methylated (ME) CpG sites; mutated p300 sequence (MT)
as negative control; and three copies of p300 consensus
sequence (P) as positive control. Biotinylated probes were
bound to nuclear extracts overexpressing Flag-tagged p300
(p300-3F), precipitated by streptavidin beads followed by
Western blotting. The results showed that p300-3F had a
relative strong binding with the WT probe (Fig. 2C, lane
2, considered as 1) and the positive control (lane 5) but
had a weak binding with the ME probe (lane 3, 0.6-fold).
However, the binding of p300 was abolished towards the
mutant MT probe (lane 4). These results indicate that p300
has a lower binding affinity for the methylated p300-1
binding site of the HOXA2 proximal promoter, resulting

in lower HOXA2 expression. Conversely, demethylation
of the HOXA2 promoter by 5’Aza appears to promote
binding of p300 to the p300-1 site and restore HOXA2
expression.

Functional analysis of HOXA2-expressing NPC
cell lines
Silencing of TSGs via promoter hypermethylation
is an early event in various cancers [7]. If inactivation of
HOXA2 contributes to NPC formation, then re-expression
of HOXA2 in NPC cells might reverse the oncogenic
features of NPC cells. A recombinant lentivirus expression
system was used to stably overexpress HOXA2 or the
vector control in HK1 and TW02 cells. Proliferation,
colony formation and cell invasion assays were used to

level and enzymatic activity of MMP-9 in HOXA2expressing and control NPC cells. As expected, MMP-9
mRNA levels were significantly reduced (to ~50%) in
HOXA2-expressing HK1 cells compared with control
cells (Fig. 3C). Even in the presence of phorbol myristate
acetate (PMA), a known chemical that activates MMP-9
expression [23], the mRNA level of MMP-9 was again
significantly lower in HOXA2-expressing HK1 cells
(1.45-fold) compared with control cells (4.60-fold).
Western blotting showed that in the presence of HOXA2
the protein level of MMP-9 was downregulated in both
cultured medium and whole cell lysates (Fig. 3E). Gelatin
zymography assays indicated that HOXA2 expression
moderately suppressed the enzymatic ability of MMP-9
(0.73-fold) with respect to its activity in control cells (Fig.
3D, compare lane 3 and 4). In PMA-treated cells, HOXA2
overexpression was associated with a ~50% reduction in
MMP-9 enzymatic activity (0.82-fold) compared with
control cells (1.56-fold) (Fig. 3D, compare lane 1 and 2).
Collectively, HOXA2 represses MMP-9 RNA and protein
expression in NPC cells.

examine the biological functions of HOXA2 in vitro. No
significant difference was observed in the growth rate
and colony formation of HOXA2-expressing HK1 (Fig.
S5A) or TW02 cells (Fig. S5B) compared to control
cells. However, cell invasion assays indicated that fewer
HOXA2-expressing HK1 cells (0.27-fold) and TW02
cells (0.49-fold) invaded across the membrane compared
with control cells (Fig. 3A) demonstrating that HOXA2
expression inhibits the cell invasion ability. And this
inhibition was not due to a difference in cell proliferation
between HOXA2-overexpressing and control cells.

HOXA2 down-regulates MMP-9 expression and
enzymatic activity
Previous reports indicated that cell invasion
ability can be promoted by overexpression of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade various
extracellular components [18]. Next, we analyzed 22
MMPs expression from the cDNA microarray (Affymetrix)
data of nine NPC tumors versus one combined adjacent
normal (control). We found that 8 out of 22 MMPs were
overexpressed (>1.5-fold) in NPC tumors when compared
with the control (Table S3). The top of the MMPs list was
MMP-9 (40-fold higher in NPC tumors compared with
control), one of the best-studied proteinases involved in
promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. In fact, MMP9 has been reported to facilitate NPC tumorigenesis in
many studies [19-21]. As HOXA2 reportedly functions
as a transcriptional repressor during development [13,
22], we hypothesized that HOXA2 might repress MMP-9
expression. We examined the mRNA, protein expression

HOXA2 antagonizes TBP by binding to TATAbox and suppresses MMP-9 transcription
To investigate whether HOXA2 is a transcriptional
repressor of MMP-9, we generated various MMP-9
promoter deletion clones containing potential HOXA2binding sites. HOXA2 binds to the TAAT target sequence
to down-regulate the transcription of its target genes
[14, 24, 25]. A putative HOXA2-response element was
identified at the MMP-9 promoter (-1421). We constructed

Figure 6: Schematic model of silencing of the transcription repressor HOXA2 by aberrant hypermethylation enhances
invasion via MMP-9 activation in NPC. In normal cells, transcription of HOXA2 is activated by p300 binding. Subsequently, HOXA2

binds to the MMP-9 TATA-box and interferes the binding of TBP resulting in suppression of MMP-9 expression. In NPC cells, methylation
of the HOXA2 impairs the p300 binding thereby inactivates the HOXA2 gene. In the absence of transcription repressor HOXA2, TBP and
RNA polII can bind to the TATA-box of MMP-9 and activate MMP-9 expression. Elevated MMP-9 level, in turn, promotes the invasiveness
of NPC cells.

To address whether HOXA2 and TBP can directly
bind to the MMP-9 TATA-like sequence, we used purified
recombinant His-tagged HOXA2 and TBP proteins to
perform EMSAs. We found that recombinant HOXA2
and TBP proteins could both bind directly to the MMP9 TATA box biotin-labeled probe (Fig. S6, solid arrows,
lane 2 and 5). Furthermore, the two proteins might form
higher-molecular-weight dimers or multimers with the
probes (Fig. S4, dashed arrows, lane 2 and 5). Incubation
with the corresponding antibodies led to the formation
of a supershifted complex and a marked decrease in the
intensity of the lower band (Fig. S6, asterisks, lane 3
and 6). However, when the TTAAA core sequence was
mutated, the binding affinity between the recombinant
HOXA2 or TBP proteins and mutant probe dropped
dramatically (Fig. S6, lane 11 and 12).
To test whether HOXA2 could interfere with
TBP binding and inhibit MMP-9 transcription in vivo,
we performed quantitative ChIP assays on the MMP-9
promoter in HOXA2-expressing and vector control cells.
In HOXA2-expressing cells, HOXA2 bound to the MMP9 TATA box region and reduced the binding of TBP and
RNA PolII to the same region (Fig. 4D), compared with
the binding in vector control cells. These results indicate
that HOXA2 may antagonize TBP binding and RNA PolII
recruitment to the MMP-9 TATA box region, thereby
decreasing MMP-9 transcription.

five MMP-9 promoter Luc reporters (-1650, -1150,
-1073, -703 and -205~+150; Fig. 4A). MMP-9 promoter
clones and HOXA2-expressing or control vectors were
co-transfected into HK1 and 293T cells. Luciferase
assays revealed that the promoter activities of all five
MMP-9 promoter deletion clones, including the shortest
-205~+150, were suppressed in HOXA2-overexpressing
cells compared with vector control (Fig. 4A). Sequence
analysis revealed that the only possible HOXA2 binding
site within the (-205~+150) MMP-9 promoter was the
TATA-like sequence, TTAAA (-29), next to the TSS.
Luciferase assays indicated that co-transfection of either
HOXA2 or TBP expression clones with the shortest
MMP-9 promoter reporter could either suppress slightly
or activate the promoter activities (Fig. 4B). To test
whether the TATA-like sequence was responsible for the
transcriptional repression or activation, by HOXA2 or
TATA-binding protein (TBP), respectively, we generated
a site-directed MMP-9 promoter mutant, denoted as
-205 MT, in which the TTAAA sequence was mutated
to GGGGG. Luciferase assays demonstrated that this
mutation abolished the HOXA2-mediated repression or
TBP-mediated activation of MMP-9 transcription when
compared to wild type reporter (Fig. 4B) suggesting that
the TATA-like sequence is crucial for the recognition of
both HOXA2 and TBP.
To further clarify the HOXA2-binding sites in
the MMP-9 promoter, we performed DNA pull-down
experiments using the two double-stranded biotinylated
oligonucleotide probes containing the putative HOXA2response element (-1421) and the TATA-like sequence
(-29), respectively. Biotinylated probes were bound
to nuclear extracts of vector- or HOXA2-expressing
HK1 cells, purified by streptavidin beads followed by
Western blotting. The results revealed that HOXA2 had
a relatively strong affinity toward TATA-like sequence
(-29) in HOXA2-expressing HK1 extracts (Fig. 4C; antiHOXA2, anti-Flag, lane 4) when compared with vector
control extracts (Fig. 4C, lane 3). Little or no HOXA2
binding was observed to the putative HOXA2-response
element (-1421) in vector- or HOXA2-expressing HK1
extracts (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 2) indicating that HOXA2
binds to the MMP-9 promoter at (-29) but not (-1421).
Based on these findings, we hypothesized that HOXA2
may compete with TBP to block the binding of RNA
polymerase II (RNA PolII). Additional Western blot
analyses using the same DNA pull-down lysates showed
that significant TBP and RNA PolII bound to the TATAlike sequence (-29) probes (Fig. 4C; anti-TBP and antiRNA PolII, lane 3) in the absence of HOXA2 expression,
but both bound only weakly in the HOXA2-expressing
HK1 extracts (Fig. 4C, lane 4). This suggests that the TBP
and HOXA2 factors may compete for the same binding
site at (-29). The presence of HOXA2 could interfere or
compete with the binding of TBP and RNA PolII to the
MMP-9 promoter.

HOXA2 methylation status positively correlates
with EBV copy number and MMP-9 levels in
plasma from NPC patients
It is generally accepted that the cell-free DNA
(cfDNA) content is higher in cancer patients compared
with healthy people [26]. To test whether the levels of (i)
EBV copy number, (ii) HOXA2 methylation ratio and (iii)
MMP-9 levels are inter-correlated in a given sample, we
obtained 3~5 follow-up plasma samples from five treated
NPC patients (Fig. 5, designated A~E; N=22), and EBV
copy number in the plasma was monitored by q-PCR; and
cfDNA was extracted from the samples and methylation
specific-high resolution melting (MS-HRM) (Fig. S7 and
Table S4) and q-PCR was performed to detect the HOXA2
methylation ratio; and the MMP-9 levels of the plasma
samples were detected by the ELISA. Moderate to strong
positive correlations were observed when we compared the
levels of any two of the three factors (Fig. 5, r=0.55~0.7)
suggesting EBV titer, HOXA2 methylation and MMP9
level are inter-correlated with each other. Interestingly, the
values of the three factors exhibit similar trends at a given
time in a patient; however, the values vary at different time
reflecting the clinical outcome or tumor burden of a patient
during therapy. It appears that the higher the EBV copy

DISCUSSION

While normal healthy individuals have little cfDNA
in their plasma (~30 ng/ml), a high level of circulating
cfDNA (~180 ng/ml) can be detected in the plasma of
cancer patients [26]. This difference reflects that cfDNA
is mainly released from apoptotic and necrotic tumor
cells; and the amount of cfDNA may be used as a cancer
indicator [37]. As it is easier to obtain plasma samples
than biopsies, measurement of aberrant methylated
cfDNA in plasma may replace biopsies in NPC patients.
Furthermore, the sensitivity and accuracy of MS-HRM
is comparable to that of bisulfite sequencing suggesting
that MS-HRM could be used as a rapid, sensitive and
economical method for assessing HOXA2 methylation in
both tumors and plasma samples of NPC patients. The 22
plasma samples collected from 5 NPC patients at different
time intervals showed that EBV copy number, cfDNA
HOXA2 methylation percentage and the level of MMP9 are inter-correlated. The dynamic levels of these three
parameters vary over time within the same NPC patient
and they may all serve as plasma biomarkers reflecting
the tumor load of both in-situ and metastatic NPC tumors.
Finally, we propose a model in which illustrates
aberrant hypermethylation of HOXA2 increases MMP-9
expression and promotes the invasiveness of NPC cells
(Fig. 6). Silencing HOXA2 through DNA methylation may
have profound effect on gene expression profile in NPC
when considering there are ~24% of the human genes
which contain TATA-like element [38]. The final outcome
for cells with HOXA2 impairment may therefore depend
on the overall functions of all the downstream targets of
HOXA2 and/or HOXA2-TBP.

We herein identify two dysregulated transcription
cascades that contribute to NPC tumorigenesis: (1)
DNA methylation of HOXA2 impairs the binding of
transcription activator p300 on the HOXA2 promoter;
(2) the inactivation of HOXA2 promotes TBP binding on
MMP-9 promoter and activates the MMP-9 expression.
Our data indicated that methylation of HOXA2 at the
proximal p300-1 site interfered p300 binding, thereby
suppressing HOXA2 expression. Although the core
consensus sequence for p300 in the HOXA2 promoter
(NNNG/AGGAGTNNNC/G) does not contain an obvious
CG site; however, two CG sites were found flanking the
central p300-1 sequence. Thus, methylation of flanking
sequences could interfere with protein binding via steric
hindrance.
The HOXA2, located within HOXA gene cluster
on human chromosome 7, is important for neural-crestderived structures development and the segmentation
of neuromeres in hindbrain [27, 28]. HOXA2 protein
acts as a transcription regulator, and may suppress gene
expression through the HOXA2-response element [13,
14]. Through direct binding to TAAT consensus sequence,
HOX proteins may regulate the transcription of their
target genes and thereby control cell differentiation during
development [10, 29]. Dysregulation of HOXA2 may have
negative impacts on cells and/or lead to oncogenesis [30].
Aberrant expressions of HOX genes have been correlated
with breast cancer development and the malignant
behavior of cancer cells [31]. Furthermore, the HOXA
and HOXD clusters are hotspots for de novo methylation
of CpG islands in human lung adenocarcinomas [32].
Temporal and spatial changes in HOX expression in
developing and normal cells are tightly controlled. It
would be interesting to test if other HOX members are
transcriptionally repressed by DNA methylation and/or
functionally antagonized by TBP.
This is the first report to demonstrate HOXA2 can
compete with the TBP for the TATA-box due to their
DNA consensus sequence resemblance. Thereby, TBP
and HOXA2 can co-regulate the MMP-9 transcription but
they act in an opposite fashion. Conceivably, in addition to
MMP-9, other HOXA2-TBP-targeted genes’ transcription
may also be affected in NPC. The MMP family has 29
members; among these members MMP-2 and MMP9 were found to have increased enzymatic activity and
associations with metastasis in several cancers [18, 33]
including NPC [21]. Two previous reports indicated
that the MMP-9 overexpression observed in NPC was
correlated with the EBV LMP1-mediated NF-κB signaling
pathway [34] and the EBV Zta-mediated AP1 pathway
[35]. Furthermore, increased MMP-9 expression in NPC
tumors has been correlated with poor prognosis [36]. Our
present findings offer an alternative explanation for MMP9 overexpression in NPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, NPC tissue samples and plasma
The NPC cell lines, C666.1 [39] and HK1 [40],
were provided by Dr. S. W. Tsao (Hong Kong University,
SAR, China), and were cultured in 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Gibco)/RPMI1640 (Gibco BRL, Rockville,
MD). The TW02 cell line was obtained from Dr. C. T.
Lin (National Taiwan University, Taiwan); TW02 and the
embryonic kidney cell line, 293T, were cultured in 10%
FBS/DMEM (Gibco). C666.1 and HK1 cells were treated
with 10 μM demethylation agent 5’ Aza for 5 days, with
daily replacement of fresh medium. Eight pairs of frozen
NPC tumor and adjacent normal biopsies (< 2 mm) were
collected from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH;
Taiwan) by Dr. K. P. Chang. Genomic DNA and RNA
of NPC biopsies were simultaneously extracted using
the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasma
was collected from five NPC patients at CGMH by Dr.
C. L. Hsu. Plasma cell-free DNA was extracted by using
QIAamp DNA kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). This

committee of CGMH (IRB:97-1226A3 and IRB:950692B).

System (Promega) on a GLOMAX 20/20 Luminometer
(Promega).

Antibodies for Western blot analyses

Quantification of DNA methylation in NPC
biopsies by MassArray MALDI-TOF MS analysis

Primary antibodies: anti-Flag antibody (M2; Sigma),
p300 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA), and
anti-actin monoclonal antibody (MDBio, Taipei, Taiwan)
and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat antimouse antibody and goat anti-rabbit antibody) were used.
The results were visualized using an ECL detection kit
(Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Genomic DNA (2 µg) from all 16 tissue samples
were bisulfite treated using the EZ DNA Methylation
Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and subjected to PCR
amplification using three sets of HOXA2-specific bisulfite
PCR primers. The extent of methylation at the individual
CpG sites of these PCR products was further analyzed by
Sequenom MassArray Epityper (Sequenom, San Diego
CA) [41]. The degree of methylation for each CpG site
was determined using the ratio between methylated-C and
total cytosine, which ranged from 0 to 1.

Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay
ChIP assays were performed as previously described
[42]. Either 1 µg of anti-HOXA2 antibody or 2 µg of
the other specific antibodies (anti-p300, Santa Cruz;
Flag® M2, Sigma; anti-TBP, Santa Cruz; anti-RNA
polymerase II, Covance) or control IgG were used for
immunoprecipatation. The DNA fragments were purified
using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany), and Q-PCR was performed using primers
against appropriate promoter regions. The quantitative
ChIP signals (Ct values) were normalized with respect to
the input control.

Bisulfite sequencing
Bisulfite-converted DNA (100 ng) was amplified
using specific bisulfite sequencing (BS) primers that were
designed using Methprimer (http://www.urogene.org/
methprimer/, UCSF). The resulting PCR products were
cloned, and 8~10 individual clones were sequenced.

Cell proliferation and invasion assay

Gelatin zymography assay

Cell proliferation was determined by trypan blue
(Gibco) exclusion and cell counting. Stable HOXA2expressing and vector control HK1 (2x105) or TW04
(5x104) cells were seeded in 6-well plates, and cell
numbers were counted daily for 5 days. Cell invasion
was assessed using a cell invasion assay kit (Chemicon,
Temecula, CA). Briefly, HOXA2-expressing HK1 (5x105)
or TW02 cells (4x105) were seeded to the upper chamber
and cultured for 24 hr (TW02) or 72 hr (HK1), allowing
cells to migrate through the 0.8-μm membrane. The
membrane was then excised and stained with 0.1% crystal
violet; and cells were counted under a microscope. All
experiments were repeated at least three times, each in
duplicate.

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates, grown to
confluence, washed three times with serum-free medium
containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and preincubated with serum-free medium for 3 hr. The culture
medium was collected and diluted 1:1 (v/v) with 2x SDS
sample buffer and heated for 30 min at 37°C. The diluted
medium (50 μl) was separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel
containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. The gel was washed twice
with 2.5% Triton X-100, incubated for 15 min with
developing buffer (0.2 M NaCl, 0.04 M Tris-HCl, and
0.01 M CaCl2, pH 7.5) and transferred to fresh developing
buffer for 48 hr. The gel was fixed in fixing buffer [45%
(v/v) methanol, and 10% (v/v) acetic acid], stained with
0.125% Coomassie blue, and destained for visualization
of the gelatin-specific enzyme bands.

Promoter analysis and luciferase assay
The HOXA2 and MMP-9 luciferase reporters,
pHOXA2/pGL3 and pMMP-9/pGL3, were amplified
and both subcloned into the BglII and HindIII sites of the
pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). To normalize
each transfection reaction, a renilla reporter plasmid (pRLCMV; Promega) (one-tenth of the total DNA amount) was
co-transfected with the luciferase reporters. Cells were
harvested 48 hr post-transfection and lysed, and promoter
activity was assayed using the Dual Luciferase Assay

DNA pull-down assay
DNA pull-down assays were performed as
previously described [42], with some modification. The
double-stranded annealed biotinylated probes (100~250
pmole) were incubated with 25 μl M-280 Streptavidin
Dynabeads (Invitrogen) in recommended binding buffer
for 1 hr at room temperature. In parallel, 100~250 μg
2163

nuclear extracts and salmon sperm DNA 2.5μg were
incubated with 25 μl unconjugated Dynabeads (Invitrogen)
for 30 min at room temperature. The pre-cleared nuclear
extract was incubated with the probe-bounded beads for 1
hr at room temperature. The Dynabead-bound complexes
were washed six times with binding buffer containing
0.5% NP-40, and the DNA-bound proteins were eluted in
SDS sample buffer and assayed by Western blotting.
