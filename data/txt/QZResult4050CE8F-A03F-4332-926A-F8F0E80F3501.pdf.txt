ABSTRACT
Adaptation to cellular stress is not a vital function of normal cells but is
required of cancer cells, and as such might be a sensible target in cancer therapy.
Piperlongumine is a naturally occurring small molecule selectively toxic to cancer
cells. This study assesses the cytotoxicity of piperlongumine and its combination
with cisplatin in head-and-neck cancer (HNC) cells in vitro and in vivo. The effect of
piperlongumine, alone and in combination with cisplatin, was assessed in human HNC
cells and normal cells by measuring growth, death, cell cycle progression, reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production, and protein expression, and in tumor xenograft
mouse models.
Piperlongumine killed HNC cells regardless of p53 mutational status but spared
normal cells. It increased ROS accumulation in HNC cells, an effect that can be blocked
by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Piperlongumine induced selective cell death
in HNC cells by targeting the stress response to ROS, leading to the induction of
death pathways involving JNK and PARP. Piperlongumine increased cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity in HNC cells in a synergistic manner in vitro and in vivo. Piperlongumine
might be a promising small molecule with which to selectively kill HNC cells and
increase cisplatin antitumor activity by targeting the oxidative stress response.

INTRODUCTION

surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and their
combinations [8]. Despites recent advances in the
diagnosis and treatment of HNC, overall survival has
not substantially changed over the last three decades [8].
This may result from the fact that alterations in tumor
suppressor genes or signaling pathways are associated
with therapeutic resistance [9]. Gain-of-function mutations
in oncogenes and loss-of-function mutations in tumor
suppressor genes result in increased cellular stress not
ordinarily observed in normal cells [10]. Targeting cancerspecific deregulation, such as oxidative or metabolic
changes, may result in the selective death of cancer cells
[11, 12].
Piperlongumine (PL), a natural product isolated
from the long pepper Piper longum L. [13], was recently
identified as selectively toxic to cancer cells in vitro
and in vivo [14]. PL was identified in a cell-based highthroughput screen designed to find compounds with novel

Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the eighth most
common cancer worldwide, with more than half a million
new cases diagnosed each year [1]. The overall incidence
of HNC in the United States is declining despite a rising
trend of oropharyngeal cancer incidence associated with
oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) [2, 3]. Tobacco
and alcohol consumption increase the risk of developing
HNC, which is largely attributable to the genotoxic effects
of the carcinogens in these substances [4]. Over 50% of
HNC display chromosomal loss at 17p, the site of the
TP53 gene, or harbor inactivating TP53 gene mutations,
particularly in HPV-negative HNC [5, 6]. HNC with TP53
mutations is generally less responsive to chemoradiation
and shows poorer survival than HPV-positive HNC, which
commonly does not harbor TP53 mutations [5, 7].

pro-apoptotic mechanisms [14]. PL elevates ROS cellular
levels and selectively induces apoptotic death in cancer
cells, with no apparent toxicity in normal cells [14, 15].
Although tested in several types of human malignancies
[16–20], PL has not yet been tested in HNC. Further
investigation of its ROS-dependent and -independent
mechanisms and of its synergy with conventional
chemotherapeutic agents is needed [15]. Here, we show
that PL selectively kills HNC cells by targeting the
oxidative stress response and increases the antitumor
activity of cisplatin, a first-line chemotherapeutic agent
used in HNC therapy.

Piperlongumine selectively kills HNC cells but not
normal cells
The cytotoxic effects of PL were tested in cultured
human HNC cells and normal cells. PL markedly induced
death in cancer cells, while the viability of normal cells
was affected only minimally at the highest concentration
(15 µM) tested (Figure 1). The cytotoxicity of PL was
blocked by pretreatment with the antioxidant NAC,

Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay (A), trypan blue exclusion assay, and crystal violet staining (B) after exposure to 1–15 µM
piperlongumine (PL) for 48–72 h. Normal human cells (N) included oral keratinocytes (HOK), oral fibroblasts (HOF), and skin keratinocytes
(HEK) isolated from human oral mucosa and skin, respectively. The cytotoxic effect of PL was blocked by the antioxidant N-acetyl-Lcystine (NAC, 3 mM). The error bars represent s.d. from three independent experiments, each performed with triplicate samples. * denotes

indicating that PL might selectively kill cancer cells,
including HNC cells, in which an active response to
oxidative stress occurs. Western blot analysis showed that
PL significantly increased the expression of wild-type p53,
of the p53 proapoptotic targets PARP and PUMA, and of
p21 in AMC-HN9 cells. PL also increased the levels of
proapoptotic proteins in mutant p53 (R282W)-expressing
AMC-HN3 cells and in p53-null UMSCC-1 cancer cells.
This suggests that PL selectively induces cancer cell death
by modulating the expression of apoptotic and survival
pathways regardless of p53 status.

showed that PL decreased GSH levels and increased
GSSG levels in HNC cells (Figure 2 and Supplementary
Figure S1); however, PL did not increase GSSG levels in
normal HOK-1 cells. Further, the reducing agent NAC,
which extinguishes cellular ROS, prevented PL-mediated
GSH depletion. Next, the effect of PL on cellular ROS
levels in HNC and HOK-1 cells was assessed by flow
cytometry using the redox-sensitive fluorescent probe
DCF-DA. Exposure to PL for 1 h and 3 h caused a
significant increase in ROS levels in HNC cells but not in
normal HOK-1 cells. Exposure to paclitaxel for 1 h also
increased ROS levels in HNC cells; however, that effect
was reduced after 3 h, which is in contrast to the sustained
elevation of cellular ROS levels observed upon exposure
to PL. In addition to cancer cells, paclitaxel induced a
marked increase in DCF-DA fluorescence in normal HOK1 and HOF-1 cells, which PL did not do. Co-exposure with
NAC or catalase blocked the PL-induced ROS increase in
cancer cells.

PL induced a marked decrease in the number
of cancer cell colonies (Figure 3 and Supplementary

using propidium iodide staining in AMC-HN3 cells, PL
increased the sub-G1 apoptotic population, and that effect

assays showed that PL induced a significant increase in
apoptosis and cell death in HNC cells. Co-exposure to PL

and p21 increased to a greater extent in HNC cells with
wild-type p53. Since PL targets glutathione S-transferase
pi 1 (GSTP1) and links cellular ROS accumulation and
sustained c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation
[14, 21], we assessed PL-induced changes in associated

proteins and these interactions (Figure 4, Supplementary
Figures S3 and S4). PL increased the levels of cleaved
PARP, PUMA and phospho-JNK (pJNK). The activation
of pJNK was observed as early as 1 h after PL treatment
and preceded the increase in the proapoptic proteins. Coexposure to PL and the PARP inhibitor 4-ANI did not

affect the levels of JNK1 and pJNK, while the combination
of PL and JNK inhibitor significantly decreased pJNK
levels and cleaved PARP. In addition, PL-induced cell
death was blocked by PARP or pJNK inhibition to some
degree, as was observed upon co-exposure to PL and
NAC. Taken together, PL regulates ROS by targeting
GSTP1, a direct negative regulator of JNK [22, 23], and
thereby increases JNK phosphorylation. Further, since
JNK mediates cell death caused by ROS accumulation via
sustained PARP activation [24, 25], PL-induced GSTP1
inhibition and pJNK activation resulted in part in PARP
activation; however, the knockdown of GSTP1 itself did
not significantly affect PARP activation, cellular ROS
levels, or survival in AMC-HN3 cancer cells.

growth to an extent greater than the sum of the effects
of either agent alone. Phospho-p53 (Ser 15), proapoptotic
protein levels, and apoptosis were increased to a greater
extent in AMC-HN3 and -HN9 cells exposed to the
combination of PL and cisplatin than in cells exposed to
each agent alone.
We treated BALB/c athymic nude mice bearing
AMC-HN3 and -HN9 tumor xenografts with i.p. injections
of PL, cisplatin, PL plus cisplatin, or vehicle. PL or
cisplatin alone significantly decreased the growth rate
of HN3 and HN9 tumors (Figure 6 and Supplementary

synergistically suppressed in vivo tumor growth. In situ
apoptosis assays showed that TUNEL-positive apoptotic
bodies were more frequently seen in tumors treated
with PL-, cisplatin-, and PL plus cisplatin than in those
treated with vehicle. Western blot analyses of tumor
tissues showed that p53 and apoptotic protein levels were
increased to a greater extent in HN9 cells treated with the
combination of PL and cisplatin than in cells treated with
single agents.

cells by perturbing redox and ROS homeostasis. PL

mechanism upon which the cancer cell is dependent, such
as cellular ROS homeostasis, can explain the differential
response of cancer and non-transformed cells to PL. In
the present study, PL had the ability to inhibit the growth
of rapidly growing highly aggressive HNC, regardless of
p53 status. The compound caused effective cell death in
HNC, even in the context of disruptive TP53 mutations
associated with aggressive disease and poor survival
[5]. Therefore, targeting the stress phenotypes unique to
cancer cells and their associated vulnerabilities may be a
promising strategy for cancer treatment [10,11]. Our data
provide the first experimental evidence supporting PL as a
potential therapeutic agent for HNC.
The present study showed that PL was effective
in killing HNC cells via the ROS-mediated GSTP1 and
JNK pathways. Cancer cells are more dependent on
elevated ROS levels and a highly functional antioxidant
system than normal cells [10, 26]. The enzymatic
ROS detoxification systems that prevent the induction
of cell death are activated in cancer cells that resist
chemotherapeutic agents [27, 28]. PL induces apoptosis
by interfering with critical regulators of redox and ROS
homeostasis, such as GSTP1 and carbonyl reductase 1
(CBR1) [14]. Stable overexpression of GSTP1 and CBR1
in cancer cells also reduces PL-induced ROS levels
and rescues apoptosis [14]. PL targets GSTP1, which
conjugates GSH to proteins during oxidative stress [15].
Since GSTP1 is a negative regulator of JNK through
direct protein-protein interaction, inhibition of GSTP1 can
active JNK and in turn phosphorylate c-Jun [21, 22]. Our
data showed that PL activates JNK by quenching GSTP1
activity in HNC cells. Further, NAC rescued the selective
PL-induced cancer cell death mediated by the ROS stress
response pathway. The increased dependence of HNC
cells on the oxidative stress pathway may be the basis
for the selectivity of PL for cancer cells, and PL-induced
cytotoxicity may be mediated by JNK signaling.
The present data suggest that PL-induced death
in HNC cells might result from possible links between
the phosphorylation of JNK and PARP activation. PLinduced GSTP1 inhibition and pJNK activation resulted
in PARP activation. JNK mediates cell death upon ROS
accumulation via sustained PARP activation [23, 24].
ROS induce cell death signaling pathways and act as
cell death initiators through direct damage to various
macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and lipids
[29, 30]. There is evidence suggesting that JNK is an
important mediator of oxidative stress-induced apoptotic
and non-apoptotic/necrotic cell death in various cell types
stimulated with different forms of ROS [31, 32]. In our
study, high concentrations of PL induced selective nonapoptotic death in HNC cells by activation of JNK and
PARP. PARP, a key DNA repair protein, was activated
in cancer cells treated with PL, and pharmacological
inhibition of PARP offered significant protection against
PL-induced death. However, knockdown of GSTP1 did
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

not affect PL-induced ROS levels or death in cancer cells,
and pharmacological inhibition of JNK or PARP did not
completely abrogate PL-induced death. These results may
reflect the fact that other cell death signaling pathways
may be involved. Although PL is associated with cell
death in both wild-type p53 and mutant p53-harboring
cancer cells, PL increases the levels of p53-Ser-15 and
PUMA, which might in part explain apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death in cancer cells [33]. In addition, recent
studies showed that PL was a promising agent in several
types of human malignancies targeting other pathways,
e.g. p38 [17, 18] and STAT3 [20].
Our study revealed that PL synergized with
cisplatin. Since cisplatin is a first-line chemotherapeutic
agent used in HNC, the combination of PL and cisplatin
may be effective in the clinical setting. The present study
is the first to show that PL potentiates the cytotoxic effect
of cisplatin in HNC cells in vitro and in vivo. PL induced a
robust increase in cisplatin-mediated apoptosis via PUMA
and PARP activation. HNC with loss or mutation of TP53
is associated with cisplatin resistance through lack of
senescence [34]. PL induces cell cycle arrest and inhibits
angiogenesis and metastasis in cancer cells regardless of
p53 status [14, 35]. PL sensitizes p53-mutant HNC cells
to cisplatin, leading to increased cytotoxicity and more
effective therapy for aggressive HNC. In addition, our
data showed that PL did not have any apparent adverse
effects in vivo. Taken together, these findings may be
of paramount clinical significance: by inducing the
death of cells with ROS accumulation, PL could reduce
the dose of cisplatin required in the clinical setting and
thereby minimize the potential adverse effects of cisplatin
chemotherapy.
In conclusion, our data suggest that PL induces ROS
accumulation and cell death selectively in HNC cells by
targeting critical regulators of ROS homeostasis. The
study also revealed that PL can trigger HNC cell death via
JNK and PARP activation, which is a novel mechanism.
Further, PL can enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in
both p53-wild-type and p53-mutant HNC cells. This
study supports the need for further investigation of PL
as a potential cancer therapy, particularly for HNC with
aggressive phenotypes.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell culture
In vitro assays, including cell viability, were
performed in several HNC cell lines: AMC-HN2, -HN3,
-HN4, -HN6, -HN7, -HN8, and -HN9 (grown in Eagle’s
minimum essential medium; Life TechnologiesTM,

medium, Life TechnologiesTM), and UMSCC1 and 93-VU147T (grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium, Life
TechnologiesTM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum. All cancer cell lines were authenticated by DNA
(short-tandem-repeat, STR) profiling provided by the cell
bank. The in vitro assays were also performed in normal
human cells: oral keratinocytes (HOK), oral fibroblasts
(HOF), and skin keratinocytes (HEK) obtained from
patients undergoing surgery were grown in EpiLife®
serum-free cell culture medium supplemented with bovine
pituitary extract (BPE) and recombinant epidermal growth
factor (rEGF) (Life TechnologiesTM). The cells were
incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2.

To assay total cellular glutathione (GSH), tumor
and normal cells were exposed to PL and N-acetyl-Lcysteine (3 mM, NAC, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells (1 × 106)
were collected, centrifuged and lysed in 100 µL icecold lysis buffer for 10 min. The lysate was centrifuged
for 10 min and the supernatant was used to assay GSH
with a glutathione colorimetric detection kit (BioVision
Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA). The total amount of GSH was
measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Molecular
Devices) at excitation (ex)/emission (em) = 380/460
nm. Quantification of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) was
performed using a GSH/GSSG detection kit (ABcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA). The drug-treated cells were
collected in ice-cold buffer, homogenized and sonicated in
icy water. GSH quencher (10 µL) was added and incubated
for 10 min to quench GSH at room temperature. The
samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was used
to determine the GSSG concentration according to the
manuscript protocol using a fluorescence plate reader. The
change in GSSG levels in PL-treated samples compared
to DMSO-treated control samples was expressed as the
fold change.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined by trypan blue
exclusion, crystal violet staining, MTT and clonogenic
assays. For trypan blue exclusion, cells were seeded
at 1 × 105 in 6-well plates, allowed to reach 60–70%
confluence, and treated with PL (Tocris Bioscience,
Bristol, UK) for 48 h. The cells were then trypsinized,
stained with 0.4% trypan blue (Life TechnologiesTM),
and counted using a hemocytometer. For crystal violet
staining, used for visual quantification of cell viability,
cells were grown in 6-well plates and exposed to PL for
48 h. After the medium was removed, cells were washed
in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fixed with icecold 100% methanol, and stained with 0.5% crystal
violet solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Louis, MO, USA). For
MTT assays, cells were seeded at 3–5 × 103 cells/well
in 96-well plates, incubated overnight, and exposed to
PL and cis-platinum (II) diamine dichloride (cisplatin;
Sigma-Aldrich), alone or in combination, for 72 h. The
cells were then exposed to the tetrazolium compound
3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h, after which
solubilization buffer was added for 2 h. The absorbance
in each well was measured at 570 nm using a SpectraMax
M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA). For clonogenic assays, cells were exposed to
PL or DMSO for 48 h, and then incubated in drug-free
medium for 7–10 d. The wells were stained with 0.5%
crystal violet solution, and the number of colonies was
counted. All the assays were performed with triplicate
samples and repeated three times.
The interaction of two drugs was considered
synergistic when growth suppression was greater than
the sum of the suppression induced by either drug alone
[36]. Briefly, the combination index (CI) was calculated
according to the relative fraction of cells affected: CI = 1,
additive interaction; CI < 1, synergistic interaction; CI >
1, antagonistic interaction.

Cell cycle and cell death assays
For cell cycle assays, cells were exposed to PL for
48 h. The cells were then trypsinized, fixed overnight in
ice-cold ethanol, and stained for 30 min with propidium
iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37oC. The cellular DNA content
was measured using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD
Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA). For cell death assays,
cells were cultured with PL and cisplatin, alone or in
combination, or an equivalent amount of DMSO (vehicle
control). After 48 h, cells were harvested, washed in
ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in binding buffer. Cells
were also pretreated with 3 mM NAC for 1 h or with 2
µM poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor
4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide (4-ANI, Sigma-Aldrich)
for 16 h, before exposure to PL. Cells were then stained
with annexin V-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and
propidium iodide using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis
detection kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
All data were analyzed using the Cell Quest software (BD
Biosciences).

Measurement of ROS production
Cells were exposed to 10 µM PL, 20 nM paclitaxel
(Sigma-Aldrich), or an equivalent amount of DMSO
(control) for 1 and 3 h and ROS generation was detected
with 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA)

NAC for 1 h or catalase (CAT, 2,000 UmL–1, SigmaAldrich) for 2 h, before exposure to PL (10 µM) or
paclitaxel (25 nM, Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h. ROS levels

4 µg/mL polybrene (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA) overnight. Selection was performed using 2 µg/
mL puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein expression and
knockdown were confirmed by Western blotting using
anti-p53 and anti-GSTP1 antibodies.

Tumor xenograft and in situ apoptosis assays
All animal study procedures were performed in
accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Six-week-old athymic
male nude mice (nu/nu) were purchased from Central
Lab Animal Inc. (Seoul, Korea). AMC-HN9 cells (5 ×
106) were injected subcutaneously into each flank. Tumor
volume and body weight were measured every other day.
Tumors were measured using a caliper, and volume was
calculated as (length × width2)/2. Treatment began when
the cell implants became palpable nodules (= day 0). Mice
were randomized into four treatment groups: vehicle, PL,
cisplatin, and PL plus cisplatin.
Mice were treated by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
of 2.5 mg/kg PL once per day, or by i.p. injection of 5
mg/kg cisplatin once per week, or with a combination of
PL and cisplatin according to the same schedules. The
mice were sacrificed on day 21, and tumors were isolated
and analyzed by immunoblotting and in situ terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end
labeling (TUNEL) assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA). The number of apoptotic bodies was counted
blindly in ten randomly selected high-power fields. From
mice with PL treatment or control, whole blood samples
were collected from the tail vein and analyzed using an
automated hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
CA, USA). For histological evaluation, normal tissues
from vital organs, e.g., the oral cavity, lung, liver, kidney,
spleen and small/large intestines, were isolated, fixed
in formalin, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained
by hematoxylin and eosin. The statistical significance
between different treatment groups was assessed by twotailed Mann-Whitney U-test or Student’s t-test.

Immunoblotting
Tumor cells were exposed to PL or cisplatin, alone
or in combination. Cells were also pretreated with 2 µM of
the PARP inhibitor 4-ANI for 16 h or the c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1
h, before exposure to 10 µM PL for 24 h. Cells were lysed
at 4°C in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Immunoblotting
was performed according to standard procedures. Briefly,
a total of 50 µg protein was resolved by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) on 10–12% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with
primary and secondary antibodies. The following primary
antibodies were used: p53 (DO1) and JNK1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); and p21WAF1/
CIP1
, PUMA, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP), phospho-p53-Ser15, phospho-JNK (pJNK), and
glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). β-actin (Sigma) was
used as the loading control. All antibodies were diluted
between 1:250 and 1:5,000.

Transfection and infection
For knockdown of TP53, AMC-HN9 with wildtype (wt) p53 was seeded onto 60 mm plates in medium
without antibiotics, and 18 h later was transfected with
50 nmol/L small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting
human TP53 or a scrambled control siRNA (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Transfections were conducted using the
Lipofectamine RNAi Max reagent (Life TechnologiesTM).
After 48 h, cells were exposed to PL for an additional
period of 24 h and then analyzed for protein expression.
For expression of p53, wt p53 was stably transfected in
the p53-null UMSCC-1 cell line using a retroviral vector
containing puromycine resistance (Cell Biolabs Inc., San
Diego, CA, USA). For knockdown of GSTP1, AMCHN3 cells were stably transfected with small hairpin
RNA (shRNA) directed against GSTP1 or control shRNA
lentiviral vector (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Forty-eight
hours post-transfection, cells at 60–70% confluence were
infected with virus-containing media supplemented with
