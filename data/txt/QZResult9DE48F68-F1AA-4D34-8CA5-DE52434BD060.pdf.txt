BACKGROUND: Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with somatic gain-of-function mutations of Janus
kinase-2 (JAK2). Therapeutic options are limited in patients with advanced disease. Ruxolitinib, an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is active
in preclinical models of PV. The long-term efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in patients with advanced PV who are refractory or intolerant to hydroxyurea were studied in a phase 2 trial. METHODS: Response was assessed using modified European LeukemiaNet criteria,
which included a reduction in hematocrit to < 45% without phlebotomy, resolution of palpable splenomegaly, normalization of white
blood cell and platelet counts, and reduction in PV-associated symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients received ruxolitinib for a
median of 152 weeks (range, 31 weeks-177 weeks) or 35.0 months (range, 7.1 months-40.7 months). Hematocrit < 45% without phlebotomy
was achieved in 97% of patients by week 24. Only 1 patient required a phlebotomy after week 4. Among patients with palpable splenomegaly
at baseline, 44% and 63%, respectively, achieved nonpalpable spleen measurements at weeks 24 and 144. Clinically meaningful improvements in pruritus, night sweats, and bone pain were observed within 4 weeks of the initiation of therapy and maintained with continued treatment. Ruxolitinib treatment also reduced elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and granulocyte activation. Thrombocytopenia and
anemia were the most common adverse events. Thrombocytopenia of  grade 3 or anemia of  grade 3 (according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0) occurred in 3 patients each (9%) (1 patient had both) and were managed
with dose modification. CONCLUSIONS: Ruxolitinib was generally well tolerated and provided rapid and durable clinical benefits in

INTRODUCTION
Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of the erythroid, myeloid,
and megakaryocyte lineages. Increased erythrocyte production results in increased red blood cell mass, which contributes
to mortality and significant morbidity.1,2 White blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts may also be elevated. Patients often
suffer from burdensome symptoms, such as fatigue, pruritus, and night sweats, and may have enlarged spleens.2-4 PV is
also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).2

Original Article

Therapeutic goals include the prevention and management of thrombotic and bleeding complications,
symptom control, and risk minimization for progression
to post-PV myelofibrosis or AML.2 Recent guidelines
have recommended all patients be managed with phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit < 45%, and with low-dose
aspirin.2 Hydroxyurea and interferon-a (IFN-a) are recommended as initial therapies for high-risk patients.2
These agents can be interchanged for second-line therapy
in the event of intolerance or refractoriness to first-line
therapy.2 In particular, IFN-a is limited by tolerability
issues.5 Pipobroman and busulfan are second-line therapies reserved for patients with a shorter life expectancy
because of their leukemogenic effect.2
Overactive Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducers
and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling resulting
from gain-of-function mutations of JAK2, such as
JAK2V617F and JAK2 exon 12, are causally linked to PV
pathogenesis.6-9 Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor
that has demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with
myelofibrosis.10-12 Ruxolitinib is also active in preclinical
models of PV.13 We investigated the clinical activity of
ruxolitinib in patients with advanced PV or essential
thrombocythemia in an open-label, phase 2 study (study
INCB18424-256), and herein present data from patients
with PV enrolled in this study.
The current study is registered at www.Clinical
Trials.gov (NCT00726232).

before enrollment. Complete enrollment criteria are provided in the online supplemental material.
Study Design

Six to 8 patients were randomized to 1 of 3 ruxolitinib
dose-finding cohorts: 10 mg twice daily, 25 mg twice
daily, or 50 mg once daily. The dose-expansion cohort
was determined not on the basis of predefined statistical
analyses, but on a general review by both the sponsor and
the investigators of the efficacy and safety data of patients
enrolled in the dose-finding cohorts who completed at
least 56 days of treatment. Details regarding dosing
adjustments for hematologic or nonhematologic AEs as
well as study visit evaluations, including timing of blood
count measurements, are provided in the online supplemental material. At each study visit, patients used a
numeric rating scale to rate pruritus, bone pain, night
sweats, and fever on a scale of 0 (absent) to 10 (worst possible), reporting the worst level of symptoms experienced
during the 7 days preceding the study visit.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of the participating institutions and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, as
described in the International Conference on Harmonisation’s Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and applicable
regulatory requirements. All patients provided written
informed consent.
Study Assessments

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PV according to the World Health Organization criteria14 were enrolled. As determined by the investigator, patients with
disease who were refractory to treatment with hydroxyurea or for whom hydroxyurea was contraindicated were
eligible. Patients who refused further hydroxyurea treatment because of adverse events (AEs) were also eligible;
these patients must have had a trial with hydroxyurea, and
the investigator must have concurred that discontinuation
of hydroxyurea was in the best interest of the patient. Further breakdown of intolerance versus resistance was not
possible because the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria for hydroxyurea resistance or intolerance15 were published >2 years after the current study was initiated.
Patients were required to have hematocrit > 45% or 2
phlebotomies within the 24 weeks before enrollment,
with at least 1 phlebotomy performed within 12 weeks
514

At the time this study was enrolling patients, the 2009 clinicohematologic criteria of the ELN represented the most
current standardized definition for monitoring and assessing treatment response in patients with PV.16 Although
published after this study was initiated, a modified version
of these criteria was used to assess response in the current
study. Complete response (CR) was defined as hematocrit
< 45% without phlebotomy, a platelet count  400 3
109/L, a WBC count  10 3 109/L, a normal spleen as
assessed by palpation, and no pruritus within the previous
week. A partial response (PR) was defined as hematocrit
<45% without phlebotomy after week 4. These criteria
differed from the published 2009 ELN criteria in that
splenomegaly was assessed using palpation instead of imaging, and symptom evaluation was limited to pruritus,
because headache and microvascular symptoms were not
assessed in the symptom questionnaire (see online supplemental material). These modified ELN criteria were generally similar to the original protocol-defined criteria for CR
and PR (see online supplemental material) and were used
to allow for a better comparison of response rates observed

in this study versus future clinical trials in patients with
PV. Although updated ELN criteria were released in April
2013,17 these could not be used in the current analysis
because data that would be required to assess response
according to the 2013 criteria were not collected during the
current study (see online supplemental material).
Patients could be evaluated for response no sooner
than week 12. Response required the following: 1) continuous absence of phlebotomy from week 4 through the
time of response (minimum through week 12) and 2) hematocrit < 45%. To avoid assigning clinical significance
to minor fluctuations in laboratory values, patients were
considered to have maintained hematocrit <45% until
their hematocrit was 45% and also proportionally
increased by  10% from the nadir.
The cumulative probability over time of achieving either a CR or PR as the observed first response, the cumulative probability over time of achieving a best response of
CR or PR, and the durability of response were assessed
using the Kaplan-Meier method. The percentages of
patients with WBC counts >10 3 109/L or >15 3 109/L
at baseline who achieved a sustained (ie, 12 weeks)
reduction in their post-baseline WBC count to  10 3
109/L were evaluated. The sustained reductions in the
post-baseline platelet count to  400 3 109/L in patients
with platelet counts >400 3 109/L or >600 3 109/L at
baseline were also evaluated. Hemoglobin, WBC, and platelet counts over time were summarized descriptively.
Analyses of changes in palpable spleen length
included both the percentage of patients with a  50%
reduction in spleen size among those patients with a
spleen length measurement at baseline and the percentage
of patients who achieved a nonpalpable spleen measurement among those patients with palpable spleen at baseline. Symptom analyses included both the percentage of
patients with a  50% reduction and those with complete
resolution of pruritus, night sweats, and bone pain in
patients with symptoms at baseline. For the WBC count,
platelet count, spleen, and symptom analyses, patients
who discontinued treatment were counted as not having a
response for all study visits that they would have completed up to the date of analysis based on their date of
enrollment. AEs were evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0).18 AEs are reported regardless of causality because investigator-assessed attribution of AEs has
been shown to be difficult to determine and of limited
value.19 Methods for the pharmacodynamic and molecular analyses performed during the study are provided in
the online supplemental material.

Three patients received previous chemotherapy and were deemed by the
clinical investigator to not be candidates for hydroxyurea therapy. These

RESULTS
Patients

Starting in July 2008, a total of 34 patients with PV from 6
centers in the United States and Italy were enrolled in the
current ongoing study. Baseline characteristics of the patients
reflected an advanced disease status (Table 1). The median
hematocrit was 46.7%, and all patients had received at least
1 prior therapy, with the most common being hydroxyurea.
The majority of patients (70.5%) required at least 2 phlebotomies within the 24 weeks before the first dose. At the
time of data cutoff, the median follow-up duration was 154
weeks (range, 35 weeks-179 weeks) or 35.4 months (range,
8.1 months-41.2 months). Twenty-six of 34 patients (76%)
remained on the study for at least 144 weeks (online supplemental material Fig. S1). Reasons for discontinuation
included progression to myelofibrosis (3 patients), withdrawal of consent (2 patients), AEs (2 patients), and other
causes (1 patient) (online supplemental material Fig. S2).
Efficacy

Response, as defined by modified 2009 ELN criteria,
was achieved in 97% of patients by week 24 (Fig. 1a).

(PR) as the observed first response is shown. (b) KaplanMeier plot of the cumulative probability over time of achieving a best response of a CR or PR is shown. Note that the cumulative probability of CR and PR does not add up to 1
because patients with a CR as their best response were censored at the time of CR for analysis of PR. (c) Kaplan-Meier
plot of time to first hematocrit  45% is shown.

Twenty patients (59%) achieved a CR as their best
response and 13 patients (38%) achieved a PR as their
best response. The majority of CRs occurred within the
516

first year (Fig. 1b). Response was durable; among
responding patients, the probability of maintaining a hematocrit < 45% without phlebotomy for 48 weeks and
144 weeks, respectively, was 85% and 61% (Fig. 1c). Of
the 11 patients who lost their response by experiencing a
hematocrit  45% at any time after their initial response,
8 patients had a subsequent hematocrit < 45% without
an intervening phlebotomy, 2 patients discontinued therapy (AE of renal neoplasm, consent withdrawn), and 1
patient remains on therapy, but without an available
follow-up hematocrit measurement before data cutoff.
Four patients required phlebotomy during the study;
of these, 3 required phlebotomy within the first 15 days
and did not require any further phlebotomy through the
time of last follow-up. One patient did not respond to
therapy and required 3 phlebotomies during the study, the
last of which occurred on day 381. This patient was subsequently phlebotomy free for 88 weeks and was continuing
on study at the time of the data cutoff. The reduction in
phlebotomy requirements was reflected in the pattern of
hemoglobin over time. The median hemoglobin at baseline was 146.0 g/L, reached a nadir of 115.5 g/L at week
12, and recovered to 128.0 g/L at week 144 (Fig. 2a).
Of 25 patients with a WBC count >10 3 109/L
at baseline, a sustained reduction in the WBC count to
 10 3 109/L was achieved in 76% of patients. Of 15
patients with a WBC count >15 3 109/L at baseline, a
sustained reduction in the WBC count to  10 3 109/L
was achieved in 73% of patients. The median WBC
count at baseline in all 34 patients was 13.2 3 109/L;
this decreased after treatment with ruxolitinib to 6.9 3
109/L at week 144 (Fig. 2b). Of 23 patients with a platelet count >400 3 109/L at baseline, a sustained reduction to a platelet count of  400 3 109/L was achieved
in 74% of patients. Of the 13 patients with a platelet
count >600 3 109/L at baseline, a sustained reduction
to a platelet count  400 3 109/L was achieved in 69%
of patients. The median platelet count at baseline in all
34 patients was 526.5 3 109/L; this was reduced with
treatment to 281.0 3 109/L at week 144 (Fig. 2c).
Reduction in palpable spleen length was rapid.
Among patients with palpable splenomegaly with a
recorded spleen measurement at baseline, 70% achieved
a  50% reduction in palpable spleen at week 24. In addition, 44% of patients with palpable splenomegaly at baseline reduced their spleen size to become nonpalpable at
week 24. By week 144, 64% of patients had achieved a
 50% reduction in palpable spleen length and 63% had
reduced their spleen size to become nonpalpable
(Fig. 2d). Clinically meaningful improvements in

patients who were treated with ruxolitinib and who achieved
a  50% reduction and a 100% reduction in pruritus, night

patients with symptom scores > 2 at baseline are shown. A
100% reduction corresponds to a score of 0 for individual
symptoms.

pruritus, night sweats, and bone pain were observed
within 4 weeks of the initiation of therapy and were maintained through week 144 (Fig. 3).
Pharmacodynamic and Molecular Parameters

All patients were found to be JAK2V167F-positive and
had a JAK2V617F allele burden of  20% at baseline.
Ruxolitinib treatment decreased the JAK2V617F allele
burden by a mean of 8%, 14%, and 22%, respectively, after 48 weeks, 96 weeks, and 144 weeks (online supplemental material Fig. S3). The percentage of patients who
achieved a partial (50%) reduction in the JAK2V617F
allele burden at any time during the first year, any time
during the first 2 years, and any time during the first
3 years of therapy were 5.9%, 14.7%, and 23.5%, respectively. No patients achieved a complete reduction (<1%
JAK2V617F allele burden). Suppression of JAK-STAT

spleen length, the number was 25 at all visits except for week
144, when there were 24 evaluable patients (1 patient was
missing data). Two patients had a palpable spleen at baseline
but no specific measurement was recorded. Thus, for analysis
of the  50% reduction in palpable spleen length, the number
was 23 at all visits except for week 144, when there were 22
evaluable patients (1 patient had missing data).

signaling by ruxolitinib was demonstrated by decreased
phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) levels in peripheral
blood leukocytes (online supplemental material Fig. S4a).
Changes in plasma levels of inflammatory markers and
mediators, granulocyte leukocyte alkaline phosphatase,
and microRNA expression after ruxolitinib treatment are
described in the online supplemental material.
Exposure and Safety

At the time of data cutoff, there were 87.2 patient-years of
exposure and the median duration of exposure was 152
weeks (range, 31 weeks-177 weeks) or 35.0 months
(range, 7.1 months-40.7 months). At day 56, efficacy and
safety were found to be similar among the 3 cohorts.
Because the study envisaged a strategy of individual dose
titration based on safety and efficacy, the sponsor and
investigators agreed to expand the lowest starting dose
that demonstrated efficacy (10 mg twice daily), with
allowances for dose modification on an individual patient
basis (online supplemental material Fig. S2). The mean
and median total daily doses for the entire study were
25.3 mg and 21.7 mg, respectively, corresponding to a
dose of approximately 10 mg twice daily.
Thrombocytopenia and anemia were the most
common hematologic AEs and were primarily grade 1 (Table 2). Anemia of  grade 3 occurred in 3 patients
(9%) and thrombocytopenia of  grade 3 occurred in 3
patients (9%) (1 patient had both). Of these 5 patients, 3
patients with anemia of  grade 3 or thrombocytopenia
of  grade 3 and 1 additional patient with grade 2 anemia
518

had worsening of their underlying disease (worsening
splenomegaly, leukocytosis, or anemia). Of these 4
patients, 3 subsequently developed myelofibrosis and
were discontinued from the study. Treatment-related anemia and thrombocytopenia were generally manageable
with dose interruptions and/or reductions; there were no
treatment discontinuations reported for these events.
The most common (10%) nonhematologic AEs,
regardless of causality, were diarrhea (all grade 1 or 2) and
pyrexia (mostly grade 1 or 2) (Table 2). Seventeen nonhematologic AEs of  grade 3 were reported in 12 patients.
Two patients experienced pneumonia; 1 continued treatment and the other patient’s dosing (15 mg twice daily)
was briefly interrupted before continuing on study. Two
patients experienced increased gamma-glutamyl transferase;
no other liver function abnormalities or other concomitant
AEs were reported at the time of this increase, and both
patients continued treatment. One patient experienced pulmonary embolism that occurred immediately upon disembarking from an airplane after a long-distance flight; no
other thromboembolic events were reported. No cases of
transformation to AML were reported. Two patients discontinued treatment because of nonhematologic AEs of 
grade 3 (renal neoplasm, atrial flutter). Evaluation of AEs
at the time of treatment discontinuation demonstrated no
pattern of events to indicate a withdrawal syndrome.
DISCUSSION
The 2009 ELN clinicohematologic response criteria were
developed to facilitate the assessment of investigational
Cancer

therapies for the management of patients with PV, and
include assessment of 5 clinically relevant factors (hematocrit, WBC count, platelet count, splenomegaly, and
symptoms).16 Based on the modified 2009 ELN criteria
used in this study, a response to ruxolitinib was achieved in
97% of patients by week 24; 59% of patients achieved a
CR, with all 5 factors having normalized. Responses were
durable and 26 patients (76%) remained on therapy after a
median follow-up of approximately 3 years. Only 1 patient
did not meet the modified 2009 ELN response criteria
used in this analysis but was continuing on study at the
time of last follow-up. Other therapies are being investigated in patients with PV, most notably pegylated IFN-a2a. In two phase 2 studies, treatment with pegylated IFNa-2a yielded high hematologic response rates (70%-82%)
in both treatment-naive and previously treated patients
with PV.20-22 However, these studies did not assess an
improvement in PV-related symptoms, which can significantly affect a patient’s quality of life.23 In addition,
IFN-related AEs led to therapy discontinuation in 10%20
and 23%22 of patients, respectively, after a median followup of 21 months and 77 months. In the current study, ruxolitinib provided rapid and sustained relief of pruritus,
night sweats, and bone pain, and no patients discontinued
therapy as a result of AEs generally related to ruxolitinib after a median of approximately 3 years of therapy. The most
common hematologic AEs were anemia and thrombocytopenia, which were predominantly grade 1, and were manageable with dose reductions or interruptions. The most
common nonhematologic AE was low-grade diarrhea,
which was observed at a similar rate (23.5%) as was noted
in patients with myelofibrosis in the COMFORT-I (Controlled Myelofibrosis Study with Oral JAK inhibitor Treatment) study who received either ruxolitinib (23.2%) or
placebo (21.2%).10
Progression to myelofibrosis was reported in 3
patients from this cohort with advanced PV, with a
median time since PV diagnosis at the time of study entry
of approximately 10 years and a median JAK2V617F
allele burden of 72%. These results should be viewed
within the context of published data that have demonstrated associations between longer disease duration (>10
years)24 and high JAK2V617F allele burden (>50%)25
with the risk of progression to myelofibrosis.
The marked reductions in pSTAT3, plasma levels of
inflammatory markers and mediators, and granulocyte
leukocyte alkaline phosphatase expression observed
within 4 weeks of the initiation of ruxolitinib suggest that
suppression of JAK signaling by ruxolitinib, with the
resulting suppression of disease-related inflammation and

granulocyte activation, may be the primary basis for the
efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients with PV. However, evaluation of other possible effects of ruxolitinib, such as the
change in microRNA expression presented herein,
may help us to better understand the biologic effects of
JAK1/JAK2 inhibition in patients with PV.
Current treatment options for patients with PV who are
refractory to or intolerant of hydroxyurea are limited, and an
effective, well-tolerated therapy remains an unmet need. Maintenance of hematocrit <45% is a rational goal to reduce
thrombotic risk.26 Other disease-associated risk factors, such as
leukocytosis27,28 and enlarged spleen,29 may also play an important role in defining patient outcomes. Therefore, it is notable that in our population of patients with advanced PV
who were refractory to or intolerant of hydroxyurea, ruxolitinib reduced hematocrit to < 45% without phlebotomy; normalized WBC and platelet counts; reduced palpable
splenomegaly; and provided relief of pruritus, night sweats,
and bone pain without overt toxicity. In addition, ruxolitinib
was able to rapidly and durably manage these primary manifestations of PV in the majority of patients enrolled in the current study. This was similar to clinical study experience in
patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, in
whom ruxolitinib was able to reduce spleen volume and
improve myelofibrosis-related symptoms and quality-of-life
measures.10,12 In addition to providing clinical benefit with
respect to primary disease manifestations, ruxolitinib therapy
was associated with prolonged survival compared with placebo10,30 or best available therapy31 in patients with myelofibrosis. Additional controlled, larger, and longer-term studies are
needed to fully address whether and how ruxolitinib may
affect the natural history of patients with advanced PV.
In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrated that patients with advanced PV who are refractory or
intolerant to hydroxyurea achieve a clinically meaningful
and durable benefit from treatment with ruxolitinib, therefore addressing an important unmet medical need. The
ongoing phase 3 RESPONSE (Study of Efficacy and Safety
in Polycythemia Vera Subjects Who Are Resistant to or
Intolerant of Hydroxyurea: JAK Inhibitor INC424
(INCB018424) Tablets Versus Best Available Care; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01243944) and RELIEF
(Switch Study From Hydroxyurea to Ruxolitinib for
RELIEF of Polycythemia Vera Symptoms; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01632904) studies will further characterize the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients with PV.
