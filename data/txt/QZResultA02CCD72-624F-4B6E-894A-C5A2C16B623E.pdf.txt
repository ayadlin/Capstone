ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs), which is now being
held responsible for the pervasive therapy resistance of pancreatic cancer, poses
a major challenge to the successful management of this devastating malignancy.
However, the molecular mechanism underlying the marked chemoresistance
of pancreatic CSCs remains largely unknown. Here we show that JNK, which is
upregulated in pancreatic CSCs and contributes to their maintenance, is critically
involved in the resistance of pancreatic CSCs to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine
(GEM). We found that JNK inhibition effectively sensitizes otherwise chemoresistant
pancreatic CSCs to 5-FU and GEM. Significantly, JNK inhibition promoted 5-FU- and
GEM-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and scavenging
intracellular ROS by use of N-acetylcysteine impaired JNK inhibition-mediated
promotion of the cytotoxicity of 5-FU and GEM. Our findings thus suggest that JNK
may contribute to the chemoresistance of pancreatic CSCs through prevention of
chemotherapeutic agents-induced increase in intracellular ROS. Our findings also
suggest that JNK inhibition combined with 5-FU- and/or GEM-based regimens may
be a rational therapeutic approach to effectively eliminate pancreatic CSCs.

therapy resistance, being refractory to both chemotherapy
and radiotherapy [3–5]. In the past decades, the survival of
patients with pancreatic cancer has been improved with the
development of fluorouracil (FU)- and gemcitabine (GEM)based chemotherapeutic regimens, however, the prognosis
of pancreatic cancer still remains miserably poor with only
less than 10% of patients surviving 5 years [5–7].

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is among the most intractable of all
human cancers and is also a leading cause of cancer-related
death in the world [1, 2]. Besides the difficulty of early
detection, which leads to dismally low surgical resection
rate, pancreatic cancer is characterized by pervasive

RESULTS

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subpopulation of cancer
cells specifically endowed with tumor-initiating capacity,
have often been associated with higher therapy resistance
compared with non-stem cancer cells and are therefore
increasingly deemed a major culprit of post-treatment
progression and/or recurrence of a variety of, albeit not
all, human cancers [8–12]. Since the identification of
pancreatic CSCs, studies have consistently shown that
pancreatic CSCs do have higher chemoresistance than
non-stem pancreatic cancer cells and have also implicated
pancreatic CSCs in the poor prognosis of pancreatic
cancer, suggesting that overcoming the chemoresistance
inherently associated with pancreatic CSCs is apparently
an indispensible step to improve overall management of
pancreatic cancer [13, 14]. However, to date, the molecular
basis on which pancreatic CSCs acquire resistance to
conventional chemotherapeutic agents against pancreatic
cancer has been poorly understood.
Here in this study, while investigating the molecular
mechanism underlying the differential chemoresistance to
5-FU and GEM between pancreatic CSCs and their nonstem counterparts, we discovered that the JNK pathway
is critically involved in pancreatic CSCs’ resistance to
these chemotherapeutic agents through suppression of the
intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our
findings suggest that targeting this JNK – “ROS defense”
axis in combination with current chemotherapeutic
regimens may be a rational approach to overcome the
therapy resistance of pancreatic cancer.

Self-renewing pancreatic cancer stem cells
are highly resistant to 5-fluorouracil and
gemcitabine compared with their differentiated
counterparts
CSCs are in general considered to be highly resistant
to chemotherapeutic drugs [9, 10]. To examine whether
this applies to the pancreatic CSCs we have established,
we used PANC-1 CSLCs, CSCs derived from the
pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 [15], and determined
the sensitivity of self-renewing (undifferentiated) PANC-1
CSLCs and their serum-differentiated counterparts to 5-FU
and GEM, which are current chemotherapeutic agents of
choice for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Treatment
of self-renewing and differentiated PANC-1 CSLCs with
5-FU for 3 days reduced the number of viable cells in a
concentration-dependent manner, with the IC50 values
being 16.8 μM and 1.7 μM, respectively (Figure 1A).
Essentially similar results were obtained when GEM was
used instead of 5-FU, with the IC50 values being 1.5 μM
and 0.12 μM for self-renewing and differentiated PANC1 CSLCs, respectively (Figure 1B). Thus, self-renewing
PANC-1 CSLCs were by far more resistant to 5-FU and
GEM than their differentiated counterparts. We then
conducted similar analyses using PSN-1 CSLCs, CSCs
derived from another pancreatic cancer cell line PSN-1
[15]. The results indicated that the IC50 values of 5-FU and

Figure 1: Pancreatic cancer stem cells show higher resistance to 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine than their non-stem
cell counterparts. (A, B) PANC-1 CSLCs, either maintained under the stem cell culture condition (Self-renewing, white bars) or

induced to undergo differentiation in the presence of serum (Differentiated, gray bars), were treated with the indicated concentrations of
5-fluorouracil (A, 5-FU) or gemcitabine (B, GEM) for 3 days. Then, the number of viable cells was determined using trypan blue as a vital
dye. Values in the graphs are expressed as relative to controls (i.e., drug concentration = 0 μM) and represent means + SD from triplicate
samples of a representative experiment repeated with similar results.

GEM for self-renewing PSN-1 CSLCs were again much
higher than those for their differentiated counterparts
[5-FU: approximately 1 μM and 0.3 μM for self-renewing
and differentiated PSN-1 CSLCs, respectively; GEM: 0.11
μM and < 0.01 μM for self-renewing and differentiated
PSN-1 CSLCs, respectively] (Supplementary Figure S1).
Thus, the self-renewing stem cell status was indeed
associated with a highly chemoresistant phenotype in
pancreatic cancer cells in this study.

To ascertain whether the effect of SP600125
on pancreatic CSCs was mediated by inhibiting
JNK activity, we next examined the effect of JNK
knockdown on resistance to 5-FU/GEM. Transfection
of pancreatic CSCs with combinations of siRNAs
directed against JNK1 and JNK2 (siJNK1/2) mRNAs
decreased the expression of JNK1 and JNK2 (Figure 3A;
Supplementary Figure S4A), and the proportion of dead
cells was substantially increased when cells were exposed
to 5-FU (Figure 3B, 3D; Supplementary Figure S4B, S4D)
or GEM (Figure 3C, 3E; Supplementary Figure S4C, S4E)
in combination with JNK knockdown. Thus, these results
strongly suggest that JNK signaling is critically involved
in the chemoresistance of pancreatic CSCs to 5-FU/GEM.

Pivotal role of JNK in the maintenance
of the chemoresistant phenotype of
pancreatic cancer stem cells
We have recently demonstrated that the JNK
signaling pathway is activated in self-renewing pancreatic
CSCs compared with their differentiated counterparts
[15]. Because our present data indicated that self-renewing
pancreatic CSCs were more resistant to 5-FU and GEM
(Figure 1; Supplementary Figure 1), we questioned whether
JNK signaling is involved in the chemoresistance of
pancreatic CSCs to these drugs. To address this question, we
determined whether the effects of 5-FU/GEM on pancreatic
CSCs were altered by treatment with the JNK inhibitor
SP600125, which effectively inhibited JNK activity in
both PANC-1 CSLCs and PSN-1 CSLCs (Figure 2A, 2B;
Supplementary Figure S2A, S2B). When the pancreatic
CSCs were exposed to 5-FU or GEM for 3 days after
first treating them with SP600125, the number of viable
cells decreased and the proportion of dead cells increased
significantly compared with 5-FU or GEM treatment
alone (Figure 2C, 2D; Supplementary Figure S2C, S2D),
suggesting that SP600125 sensitized pancreatic CSCs to
these drugs through promotion of 5-FU/GEM-induced cell
death. For confirmation, cell death was also analyzed by
treating cell cultures in situ with a fluorescent vital dye
propidium iodide (PI) instead of using trypan blue, which
enabled us to count the number of dead cells without losing
dead cells during the cell harvesting procedure. The results
were essentially similar to those obtained by using trypan
blue as a vital dye, with SP600125 pretreatment combined
with 5-FU/GEM treatment causing remarkable cell death
in pancreatic CSCs. In contrast, treatment with 5-FU/GEM
alone again had little effect on cytotoxicity (Figure 2E, 2F;
Supplementary Figure S2E, S2F).
We also asked here whether the timing of treatment
affects the effect of SP600125. PANC-1 CSLCs were
either treated with SP600125 before 5-FU treatment (pretreatment), treated simultaneously with SP600125 and
5-FU (co-treatment), or treated with SP600125 before and
simultaneously with 5-FU (pre- and co-treatment). The
results indicated that “co-treatment” was significantly less
effective than “pre-treatment” and “pre- and co-treatment”
(Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting that inhibition of
JNK prior to 5-FU treatment may be critical for efficient
sensitization of pancreatic CSCs to 5-FU.

JNK contributes to the chemoresistance of
pancreatic cancer stem cells through suppression
of 5-fluorouracil/gemcitabine-induced increase in
intracellular reactive oxygen species
We next investigated the mechanism by which
JNK contributes to the chemoresistance of pancreatic
CSCs. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been
implicated in the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic
agents such as 5-FU and GEM [16–21], we examined
the intracellular ROS levels of pancreatic CSCs after
drug treatment. We noted that treatment of PANC-1
CSLCs with 5-FU (Figure 4A) or GEM (Figure 4B)
alone modestly increased the proportion of cells with
increased intracellular ROS compared with controls. We
also noted at the same time that SP600125 treatment of
PANC-1 CSLCs increased the intracellular ROS levels
(Figure  4A, 4B). Strikingly, pretreating of PANC-1
CSLCs with SP600125 combined with 5-FU/GEM
treatment remarkably increased the proportion of ROSpositive cells compared with 5-FU/GEM treatment alone
(Figure 4A, 4B).
To determine whether the increase in intracellular
ROS caused by SP600125 pretreatment has a role in
SP600125-mediated sensitization of PANC-1 CSLCs
to 5-FU and GEM, we next examined the effect of the
antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which scavenges
free radicals by increasing intracellular glutathione
levels (GSH) [22]. NAC, which effectively suppressed
the increase in intracellular ROS, inhibited sensitization
of pancreatic CSCs to 5-FU and GEM by SP600125;
NAC treatment significantly decreased the proportion
of dead cells after treatment of PANC-1 CSLCs with
5-FU (Figure 4C; Supplementary Figure S5) and GEM
(Figure 4D) in combination with SP600125. Essentially
similar results were obtained when PSN-1 CSLCs
(Supplementary Figure S6A – S6D) were used instead
of PANC-1 CSLCs. Together, the results suggested that
SP600125 sensitized pancreatic CSCs to 5-FU and GEM
through promotion of 5-FU/GEM-induced increase in
intracellular ROS.

To ascertain that the effect of SP600125 on ROS
accumulation induced by 5-FU/GEM, as well as on ROSmediated sensitization of pancreatic CSCs to 5-FU/GEM,
was dependent on the inhibition of JNK, we next examined
the effect of JNK knockdown on the intracellular ROS
level of PANC-1 CSLCs treated with 5-FU or GEM.
Transient transfection of PANC-1 CSLCs with siJNK1/2
increased the proportion of ROS-positive cells following
treatment with 5-FU/GEM compared with 5-FU/GEM
treatment combined with control siRNA transfection
(Figure 5A, 5B). Importantly, we confirmed that NAC
treatment inhibited the augmentation of 5-FU/GEMinduced increase in intracellular ROS and cytotoxicity by
JNK knockdown (Figure 5C, 5D). Together, these results
suggested that JNK may contribute to the chemoresistance
of pancreatic CSCs by preventing drug-induced increase
in intracellular ROS.

to either chemotherapy or radiotherapy [3–5]. A growing
body of evidence has come to suggest that pancreatic
CSCs, endowed with both tumor-initiating capacity as
well as with high therapy resistance, is among the key
factors underlying the extreme refractoriness of pancreatic
cancer to conventional cancer therapies. Identification
of the molecules and/or signaling pathways that confer
chemoresistance on pancreatic CSCs, therefore, is
expected to contribute to better management of pancreatic
cancer. However, currently, the molecular basis of the
increased chemoresistance of pancreatic CSCs remains
poorly understood.
Here in this study, we first found that pancreatic
CSCs, which we have shown to have activated JNK
[15], were highly resistant to 5-FU and GEM compared
with their non-stem counterparts, essentially consistent
with earlier reports [13, 14]. We then demonstrated
that inhibition of the activated JNK in pancreatic CSCs
sensitized them to 5-FU and GEM and that JNK inhibition
did so through elevation of the intracellular ROS level
in combination with these chemotherapeutic agents.
These results suggest that a JNK-regulated ROS defense
mechanism plays a key role in the chemoresistance of
pancreatic CSCs and that targeting this mechanism may
be a useful measure to overcome the chemoresistance of
pancreatic CSCs.
Although JNK was originally identified as a positive
regulator of cell death and overwhelming evidence does
support the idea, JNK has also been shown to have a
pro-survival function depending on the context [23–25].
Indeed, there are studies suggesting that the JNK pathway
may play a positive role in chemoresistance of some cancer
types [26]. However, the role of JNK in chemoresistance/
sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells, let alone pancreatic
CSCs, to clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents has
remained largely unknown except for a report showing
that GEM-induced apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells
was dependent on JNK-mediated DUSP1 expression
[27]. In this regard, the present study is the very first to
demonstrate that JNK has a protective role against 5-FU
or GEM in pancreatic cancer cells, more specifically,
in pancreatic CSCs. On the other hand, although the
mechanisms involved in pancreatic CSC chemoresistance
are only beginning to be understood, recent studies have
suggested that uPA and c-Met may also be involved in
the chemoresistance of pancreatic CSCs, which is quite
intriguing in light of the previous observations that JNK
could function upstream and downstream of uPA and
c-Met, respectively [28–30]. Although not pursued in the
present study, investigation on the possible functional links
among uPA, c-Met, and JNK may help better understand
the whole picture of the molecular mechanism underlying
the chemoresistance of pancreatic CSCs.
In this study, we have provided evidence that
JNK contributes to the chemoresistance of pancreatic
CSCs through suppression of the intracellular ROS

JNK inhibition followed by treatment with
5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine in the absence
of simultaneous JNK inhibition does not cause
toxicity to normal human fibroblasts
We next evaluated the effects of combination
treatment with SP600125 and 5-FU/GEM on IMR90
normal human lung fibroblasts. When IMR90 cells
were treated with the drugs at their respective highest
concentrations used in combination treatments in this
study (20 μM for SP600125, 20 μM for 5-FU, and
2  μM for GEM), the viability of IMR90 cells was not
appreciably affected either by single or combination
treatments, so long as SP600125 treatment was applied
prior to 5-FU or GEM in case of combination treatments
(Figure 6A, 6B). Of note, the intracellular ROS level of
IMR90 cells remained unchanged irrespective of whether
the drugs were applied alone or in combination, which may
explain the lack of toxicity of these drugs to IMR90 cells
(Figure 6C, 6D). We also asked here whether the timing
of SP600125 treatment affects its toxicity to IMR90 cells.
Whereas “pre-treatment” and “pre- and co-treatment” of
SP600125 were similarly effective at sensitizing pancreatic
CSCs to 5-FU (Supplementary Figure S3), “pre- and
co-treatment” but not “pre-treatment” turned out to
have a growth inhibitory effect on IMR90 cells though
neither treatment induced cell death (Supplementary
Figure S7A, S7B). Thus, the results suggest that the “pretreatment” protocol might have the widest therapeutic
window when JNK inhibition is to be combined with
5-FU/GEM to target pancreatic CSCs.

human cancers, which is so often unresectable already

level. It has been demonstrated that CSCs have lower
intracellular ROS levels and that the low ROS levels are
associated with the radioresistance of CSCs [31, 32]. In
contrast to radioresistance, however, the role of enhanced
ROS defense of CSCs in chemoresistance has yet to
be established. Significantly, lines of evidence suggest
that ROS may participate in the cytotoxic mechanisms
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-FU and GEM
[17, 33–37], lending support to the idea that cellular
antioxidant capacity may determine cells’ sensitivity/
resistance to such chemotherapeutic agents. The results
of the present study, indicating that the increase in
intracellular ROS caused by JNK inhibition sensitizes
pancreatic CSCs to 5-FU and GEM, are quite in line with
466

the idea. Although only pancreatic CSCs were examined
in the present study, future studies may reveal that this
paradigm can be extended to CSCs of other cancer types.
It would also be worth mentioning here that our results
clearly demonstrated the key role of JNK in maintaining
the intracellular ROS level low in pancreatic CSCs. In
sharp contrast to the well-documented role of ROS in JNK
activation [38, 39], the role of JNK in the control of the
intracellular ROS level remains largely uninvestigated. Yet
there have been two studies reporting the ROS-inhibitory
role of JNK. Interestingly, these two studies showed that
activated JNK was localized to mitochondria and that JNK
inhibition led to accumulation of mitochondrial superoxide
[40, 41], pointing to the intriguing possibility that JNK
may have a role in keeping the mitochondrial ROS level
in check.
Unlike in normal pancreas, JNK is activated in the
majority of pancreatic cancers [42]. The significance of
JNK activation in pancreatic cancer biology remained
unclear, but we have only recently demonstrated that JNK
activation by KRas, which is mutationally activated in
the majority of pancreatic cancers, plays a key role in the
maintenance of self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity
of pancreatic CSCs [15]. The findings of the present study
now add a new role of JNK in pancreatic CSCs, namely,
the maintenance of chemoresistance. The role of KRas in
the chemoresistance of pancreatic CSCs still remains to be
explored, but a previous study showed that Ras inhibition
using farnesylthiosalicylic acid sensitized pancreatic
cancer cells to GEM [43]. It might therefore be tempting
to speculate that KRas contributes to the chemoresistance
of pancreatic CSCs as well through the activation of the
JNK-ROS defense axis.
Of importance from a therapeutic perspective, we
found in this study that JNK inhibitor pre-treatment as
well as pre- and co-treatment was superior to co-treatment
in augmenting the cytotoxicity of 5-FU to pancreatic
CSCs, whereas pre- and co-treatment was apparently
more toxic to normal human fibroblasts than the others.
The results, though being in vitro findings, suggest that
a time-staggered treatment protocol might be beneficial
in maximizing the therapeutic effect while minimizing
adverse effects if JNK inhibition is to be combined with
FU-based regimens (and possibly GEM-based regimens)
in future pancreatic cancer treatment. As an explanation
for the superior effect of JNK inhibitor pre-treatment,
we found that the increase in the intracellular ROS level
caused by JNK inhibition persisted at least for days after
cessation of JNK inhibition (S.S, and M.O., unpublished
observation), suggesting that “rewiring” of signaling
pathways [44] may have taken place with some stability
during the pre-treatment period, i.e., by the time cells were
treated with 5-FU. On the other hand, GEM for instance
reportedly exerts its cytotoxic effect on lung cancer cells
through activation of JNK [45], suggesting the possibility

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that co-treatment could render the cells even more
resistant to chemotherapeutic agents in case their cytotoxic
effect is JNK-dependent. If we take this possibility
into consideration, the pre-treatment protocol may be
superior to the others in sensitizing pancreatic CSCs to
chemotherapeutic agents, which is to be investigated using
GEM in combination with JNK inhibitor treatment.
In conclusion, we have elucidated in this study the
mechanism underlying the increased chemoresistance
of pancreatic CSCs, namely, JNK-mediated suppression
of the intracellular ROS level. Although preclinical
studies are warranted, our findings also suggest that
targeting JNK in combination with FU- or GEM-based
regimens may be a promising approach to elimination
of pancreatic CSCs and therefore successful treatment
of pancreatic cancer.

otherwise indicated, these pancreatic CSCs were stably
maintained and used for experiments under the monolayer
stem cell culture condition, as previously described
[15]. Briefly, cells were cultured on collagen-I-coated
dishes (IWAKI, Tokyo, Japan) in the stem cell culture
medium (DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 1%
B27 [Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, CA, USA], 20 ng/mL EGF
and FGF2 [Peprotech, Inc.,Rocky Hill, NJ, USA], D-(+)glucose [final concentration, 26.2 mM], L-glutamine

[final concentration, 4.5 mM], 100 units/mL penicillin
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). In principle, the stem
cell culture medium was changed every 3 days, and
EGF and FGF2 were added to the culture medium every
day. Differentiation of pancreatic CSCs was induced by
culturing the cells under the differentiation-inducing
condition (DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS) for 2 weeks,
as previously described [15]. Normal human IMR90 fetal
lung fibroblasts [46, 47] were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM/F12
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. All
IMR90 experiments were performed using low passage
number (less than 9) cells.

Japan), and the percentage of PI-positive cells (dead cells)
against Hoechst-positive cells (total cells) was determined.

Detection and measurement of
intracellular ROS
Cells were incubated in the stem cell culture
medium containing 10 μM DCF-DA for 10 min at 37°C,
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and
re-suspended in PBS. The cells were then subjected to flow
cytometric analysis, during which care was taken not to
expose the samples to light. For flow cytometric analysis,
at least 1 × 104 cells were evaluated and gated using side
and forward scatters to identify viable cell populations. All
flow cytometric experiments were run on FACSCanto™
II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA) and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software,
version7.6.5 (Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).

Gene silencing by siRNA
siRNAs against human JNK1 (VHS40722) and
JNK2 (VHS40726) as well as Medium GC Duplex #2
of Stealth RNAi™ siRNA Negative Control Duplexes
(as a control for siRNA experiments) were purchased
from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Transfection of siRNAs was performed using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX™ (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To
achieve sustained knockdown of the target genes,
siRNA transfection was repeated 4 days after the initial
transfection.

Immunoblot analysis
Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in
RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 0.1% SDS, 0.1%
sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium
pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate and
1% protease inhibitor cocktail set III [Calbiochem]).
After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4°C, the
supernatants were recovered as the cell lysates, and the
protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined
by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.,
Rockford, IL, USA). Cell lysates containing equal amounts
of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane
was probed with a primary antibody and then with an
appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody according
to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer of each
antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using
Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).

5-Fluorouracil and gemcitabine treatment and
cell viability assays
Unless otherwise indicated, throughout this study,
PANC-1 CSLCs were treated with 20 μM of 5-FU or
2 μM of GEM for 3 days. PSN-1 CSLCs were treated with
2.5 μM of 5-FU or 0.25 μM of GEM for 3 days. In each
set of treatment, cells were examined for their viability at
the end of pretreatment (i.e., SP600125 treatment [20 μM
for PANC-1 CSLCs, 10 μM for PSN-1 CSLCs] and/or
knockdown of JNK1/2), and equal numbers of viable cells
were used for subsequent 5-FU, GEM, or control (DMSO)
treatment. Viable and dead cells were identified by their
ability and inability to exclude vital dyes, respectively [48].
In brief, cells were stained with 0.2% trypan blue, and the
numbers of viable and dead cells were determined using
a hemocytometer. Cell viability (%) was defined as 100 ×
‘the number of viable cells’/ (‘the number of viable cells’ +
‘the number of dead cells’), whereas the percentage of
dead cells was defined as 100 × ‘the number of dead cells’/
(‘the number of viable cells’ + ‘the number of dead cells’).
Alternatively, cells were incubated in situ with propidium
iodide (PI, 1 μg/ml) and Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml)
for 10 min at 37°C in the CO2 incubator, to stain dead
cells and the cell nuclei, respectively. Then the numbers
of PI- and Hoechst-positive cells were scored under a
fluorescence microscope (CKX41; Olympus, Tokyo,
