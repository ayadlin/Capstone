ABSTRACT
We aimed to identify the expression patterns of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) α subunits
in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples and evaluate these subunits as
potential targets for HCC treatment. The mRNA expression profiles of NKA α subunits
in human HCC samples were analyzed. We found that the mRNA expression for NKA
α1 subunit (ATP1A1) was higher than that for other NKA α subunits. Also, ATP1A1
gene expression was markedly higher in HCC samples than in adjacent nontumor
tissue samples. Western blotting data suggested that 6 of 14 (43%) HCC samples had
elevated ATP1A1 protein expression. Furthermore, knockdown of ATP1A1 expression
in human HCC HepG2 and MHCC97H cells markedly reduced their proliferation in vitro
and suppressed the tumorigenicity of MHCC97H cells in vivo. Downregulation of
ATP1A1 expression resulted in cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis in
HepG2 cells as well as decreased migration in Hep3B cells. We further validated that
ATP1A1 downregulation caused intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species.
Pretreatment with N-acetyl cysteine blocked cell-growth inhibition induced by ATP1A1
downregulation. Collectively, these data suggested that targeting ATP1A1 is a novel
approach to the treatment of HCC.

example, even though sorafenib is approved by the Food
and Drug Administration as a standard of care in treatment
of advanced HCC, it prolonged the median overall
survival (OS) duration in HCC patients by only about 3
months, and long-term survival remains low [4]. Thus,
searching for new therapeutic targets and pertinent novel
compounds for HCC treatment remains highly important.
Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) is the most prominent member
of the P-type ATPase family, which comprises three types of
polypeptide: the α and β subunits and the FXYD proteins [5].
Investigators have identified four α and four β subunits to date
[6]. Also, researchers have extensively studied the transport
function of NKA. Specifically, it pumps three Na+ ions out
of and two K+ ions into a cell per molecule of hydrolyzed
ATP, thereby creating an electrochemical gradient across the

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the
most lethal cancers. Surgical resection at an early stage
is the only curative treatment option, but more than
80% of HCC cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage
with inoperable distant metastases [1]. Physicians
have made advances in clinical management recently,
and patients with unresectable HCC can benefit from
multimodality treatment options, such as percutaneous
ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation, transarterial
chemoembolization, high-intensity focused ultrasound,
and magnetic resonance-guided laser thermal ablation
[2–3]. However, the effectiveness of agents used in
systematic treatment of HCC is relatively limited. For

plasma membrane. In addition, NKA is a multifunctional
protein that plays roles in cell junctions, adhesion, motility,
and signal transduction [7–10]. NKA holds promise as
a novel target in anticancer therapy given its aberrant
expression and activity in various types of human cancer
[11–13]. However, the dysregulation of NKA subunits varies
among cancers; thus, its role in tumor development remains
unclear. For instance, authors have reported overexpression
of NKA α1 subunit (ATP1A1) in non-small-cell lung cancer
[14], renal clear cell carcinoma [15], glioblastoma [16],
and melanoma [17] cases but low expression in colorectal
cancer cases [18]. We hypothesized that NKA α subunits
were dysregulated in HCC and played roles in the biological
capabilities of HCC cells. In the present study, we set forth to
identify the expression patterns for NKA α subunits in HCC
samples and evaluate their potential as novel targets for HCC
treatment.

expression in a large number of human HCC samples
with data contained in the Gene Expression Omnibus,
a public functional genomic data repository supporting
Minimum Information about a Microarray Experimentcompliant data submissions [19]. Three expression data
sets GSE 14520 [20], GSE 25097 [21], and GSE 36376
[22] were included in the analysis. Data from the three
data sets are shown in Supplementary Table S1. The
results demonstrated that expression of the ATP1A1
gene was significantly higher in HCC samples than in
adjacent nontumor tissue samples in all three data sets
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (Figures 1a–1c). We
then analyzed the relationship between ATP1A1 mRNA
expression and patient survival using the GSE 36376 data
set. We grouped the patients into low and high ATP1A1
expression groups using the median expression level
in all cases as the cutoff point. Kaplan-Meier analysis
demonstrated that median survival of patients with high
ATP1A1 was 86.7 months while the patients with low
ATP1A1 was 96.2 months (P = 0.132) (Figure 1d).
Overall, ATP1A1 mRNA expression was upregulated in
HCC samples.
We further examined the ATP1A1 mRNA and
protein expression in 14 pairs of HCC samples obtained
from the tumor bank at Eastern Hepatobilliary Surgery

Hospital (Shanghai, China). We found that nine
HCC samples (64.3%) had higher ATP1A1 mRNA
expression than that in adjacent nontumor tissue samples
(Figure 1e). In addition, six HCC samples (43%) had
higher ATP1A1 protein expression than that in adjacent
nontumor tissue samples (Figures 1f and 1g). According
to the results of western-blot, patients were divided into
ATP1A1-high and ATP1A1-low group. Survival analysis
showed that The DFS in patients with ATP1A1-low and
ATP1A1-high group were 936.7 ± 865.5 days and 514
± 412.4 days, respectively (P = 0.3395, Supplementary
Figure S1).

cells at G2/M phase was accompanied by a concomitant
decrease in the arrest of cells at the G1 and S phases.
Taken together, these data suggested that induction of
cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase in HCC cells is responsible
for the cell-growth inhibition induced by downregulation
of ATP1A1 expression (Figures 3b and 3c).

Downregulation of ATP1A1 expression induces
moderate apoptotic cell death
In our cell-cycle analysis, we also found
an increase of HepG2 cells at sub-G1 phase after
knockdown of ATP1A1 expression. We next examined
HepG2 cell apoptosis using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The
mean (± SD) percentage of apoptotic ATP1A1-siRNA–
transfected cells (12.6% ± 1.5%) was significantly higher
than that of scrambled siRNA-transfected cells (1.06%
± 1.3%) (Figures 3d and 3e). Pro-apoptotic effect was
also noted in Hep3B cells after ATP1A1 knockdown
(Supplementary Figure S2).

Downregulation of ATP1A1 expression in human
HCC cells results in proliferation arrest
We constructed three short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
pools specifically targeting ATP1A1. Up to 80% of HepG2
and MHCC97H cells transfected with an ATP1A1-shRNA
vector exhibited reduced ATP1A1 expression (Figure 2a).
Also, proliferation of these cells was notably lower
than that of cells transfected with nontargeted shRNA
(Figure 2b). We also studied the effect of reduced ATP1A1
expression induced by transfection with small interfering
RNA (siRNA) on cell-cycle distribution using flow
cytometric analysis of cellular DNA content. As shown
in Figure 3a, HepG2 cells transfected with ATP1A1siRNA had remarkably reduced ATP1A1 gene expression.
ATP1A1 downregulation in HCC cells resulted in arrest
of cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The mean
(± standard deviation [SD]) G2/M cell-cycle distributions
in HepG2 cells transfected with scrambled siRNA and
ATP1A1-siRNA were 18.0% ± 2.8% and 36.9% ± 5.2%,
respectively (P < 0.01). This increase in the arrest of

Downregulation of ATP1A1 expression impairs
the migration of HCC cells
NKA plays a critical role in the formation and
maintenance of tight junction structures and permeability
in epithelial cells [23–25]. Thus, we examined the
migration of Hep3B HCC cells after knockdown of
ATP1A1 expression in them. The number of migrating
ATP1A1-knockdown cells was substantially lower than
that of control siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 4a). The
reduction in migration induced by ATP1A1 knockdown
was statistically significant (P = 0.0001) (Figure 4b).

Downregulation of ATP1A1 expression affects
the tumorigenicity of MHCC97H cells in vivo

by alteration of the expression of genes associated with
oxidation, such as GSTA1, GSTA4, ACOX2, ALDH6A1,
UCP2 and LOX, which were validated by q-PCR
(Supplementary Figure S3).
We then determined whether ATP1A1 downregulation
affects the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
via measurement of the formation of fluorescent 2′,
1′-dichloro fluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) as a result
of an oxidative reaction with intracellular free radicals. As
shown in Figure 6a, ATP1A1 downregulation-mediated
ROS formation in HepG2 cells increased two-fold after
transfection of siRNA for 24 hours. The increased ROS
formation in ATP1A1-knockdown HepG2 cells continued
for up to 96 hours. Intriguingly, intracellular formation
of both endogenous and ATP1A1 downregulationmediated ROS was inhibited by exposure of the cells to
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant and precursor of
glutathione. In addition, we examined the effect of NAC
exposure on ATP1A1 downregulation-mediated inhibition
of cell growth in HepG2 cells (Figure 6b). NAC provided
near complete protection against ATP1A1 downregulationinduced inhibition of cell growth at both 72 and 96 h.

We subcutaneously implanted MHCC97H cells
transfected with nontargeted shRNA and ATP1A1-shRNA
in nude mice. In the nontargeted shRNA-transfected
MHCC97H group, the tumorigenicity rate was 100%, as
subcutaneous solid tumors developed in all of the animals
tested in this study. In contrast, we found only one tumor
in the ATP1A1-shRNA-transfected MHCC97H group 40
days after implantation (Figure 5a). The mean volume of the
xenograft tumors generated by ATP1A1-shRNA–transfected
MHCC97H cells (47.9 mm3) was notably smaller than that
of the tumors generated by nontargeted shRNA-transfected
MHCC97H cells (370.0 mm3) (Figure 5b).

Downregulation of ATP1A1 expression causes
HCC cells to undergo oxidative stress
To understand the mechanisms associated
with ATP1A1 knockdown-elicited reduction of the
tumorigenicity of HCC cells, we used a HumanHT-12 v4
array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to identify these
mechanisms in HepG2 cells. We found that 5226 of a
total of 34,694 genes differed significantly between the
two groups of cells transfected with scramble siRNA and
ATP1A1-siRNA (P < 0.05). Among these 5226 genes,
expression of 4164 genes was downregulated, whereas
that of 1062 genes was upregulated. The top 10 downregulated and up-regulated genes after downregulation of
ATP1A1 expression are shown in Table 1. We then used
the genes with significantly different expression to enrich
the pathways using Reactome FI Cytoscape Plugin 4.
The results demonstrated that knockdown of ATP1A1
expression impaired the genes that correlated with
the cell cycle and metabolism (Table 2). The pathway
enrichment indicated that knocking down ATP1A1
expression may increase oxidative stress as evidenced

DISCUSSION
The results of the present study strongly suggest
that ATP1A1 expression was higher in a large proportion
of clinical HCC samples than nontumor liver tissue
samples. Knockdown of ATP1A1 expression remarkably
reduced the proliferation and migration and increased
apoptosis in human HCC cells in vitro and impaired their
tumorigenicity in vivo, further indicating that ATP1A1
plays an important role in HCC development and is a
potential target for HCC treatment.
As an ion transport pump, NKA not only is critical
for maintenance of the homeostasis of Na+ and K+ but
also plays a critical role in cellular function and signaling
[26–27]. Thus, downregulation of ATP1A1 expression

in cancer cells is expected to affect several processes
of cellular function. Using a genome-wide microarray,
we found that genes associated with the cell cycle and
metabolism were affected by ATP1A1 downregulation
in HCC cells. We further found that cells underwent
oxidative stress following ATP1A1 downregulation
evidenced by increased intracellular accumulation of ROS
in ATP1A1 knockdown HCC” cells. Pretreatment with
NAC blocked cell-growth inhibition induced by ATP1A1
downregulation, implying that ROS generation is essential
for ATP1A1 knockdown-mediated proliferation arrest.
Excessive ROS formation may cause oxidative injury
of DNA [28], which can induce apoptosis and cell-cycle
arrest via checkpoint activation [29–30].
Cardiac glycosides, a class of steroid-like compounds
that include well-known drugs such as digoxin and
digitoxin, are inhibitors of NKA activity. Over the past
3 decades, researchers have suggested that cardiac
glycosides inhibit cell proliferation and exert valuable
cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines
[31–33]. Cardiac glycosides are now being studied in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

several clinical trials to determine their possible roles in
cancer treatment [34]. Different cardiac glycosides exhibit
varied levels of binding affinity to each α subunit of NKA.
Hauck et al. [35] reported that digoxin (α2 = α3 > α1) and
β-acetyldigoxin (α1 > α3) had distinct isoform-specific
affinities but that ouabain, digitoxin, and methyldigoxin
did not have any differences in isoform-specific affinities.
Because the α subunit expression patterns in HCC samples
demonstrated increased α1 expression, the cardiac glycosides
used for HCC treatment should be those with greater affinity
for α1than for other α subunits.
How inhibition of α1 expression increases oxidative
stress as evidenced by increased formation of ROS in
HepG2 cells remains unclear. We previously reported that
treatment with the cardiac glycoside oleandrin inhibits the
proliferation of BRO human melanoma cells by increasing
ROS generation [36]. Excessive ROS production results in
DNA damage and activates cell-cycle checkpoints, leading
to cell-cycle arrest and prevention of the replication of
damaged and defective DNA [37]. Also, activation of p53
is a frequent response to oxidative stress and is critical for
28189

Oncotarget

cell-cycle-checkpoint regulation [38]. Our preliminary data
demonstrated that compared to HepG2 cells transfected with
scrambled siRNA, HepG2 cells transfected with ATP1A1siRNA had higher expression of p53 and phosphorylation
of p53 on serine 15. Pretreatment with NAC could partially
reduce the activation of p53 in HepG2 cells transfected with
ATP1A1siRNA (Supplementary Figure S4). Thus, increased
ROS production resulted in p53 activation could be one of
the mechanism for the proliferation arrest upon ATP1A1
silencing. Studies demonstrated that cells with expressing
a dominant-negative form of Sir2 potentiate p53 activity
in response to oxidative stress [39–40]. Additionally,
p53 can increase ROS levels via its downstream effector
p66SHC [41–42]. However, there must be other potential
mechanisms involved in the effect of ATP1A1 silencing
on cell proliferation in p53 mutant or p53 null cells, which
needs further investigation.
The limitations of our study: Firstly, limited
tissue samples were available to determine the protein
expression of ATP1A1. For relationship between ATP1A1
protein expression and patient survival, the sample size
was too small to reach the statistical significance. Second,
the underlying mechanisms of impacts of ATP1A1
knockdown on liver cancer cells need further explorations.
In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time
overexpression of ATP1A1 in a large number of clinical
HCC samples. ATP1A1 downregulation remarkably
reduced HCC cell proliferation in vitro and impaired cell
tumorigenesis in vivo. Thus, ATP1A1 could be considered
a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

equipped with a 488-nm argon laser, and the cell populations
in the different cell-cycle phases were quantified using the
ModFit software program (Verity Software House, USA).
This experiment was performed in triplicate.

TUNEL assay
Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at
room temperature. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and
incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice. They
were then washed twice with PBS and incubated in a
TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere in the dark. The cells that underwent apoptosis
were examined under a fluorescence microscope at a
magnification of 20× (EVOS Cell Imaging Systems;
AMG, Mill Creek, WA, USA).

Cell migration assay
A cell migration assay was carried out using
Transwell filter chambers (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA). Briefly, 5 × 104 Hep3B cells transfected with
control siRNA or ATP1A1 siRNA were seeded into the top
inserts of the chambers. DMEM containing 10% FBS was
added to the receiver wells to trigger cell migration. After
6 h of incubation, a cotton swab moistened with medium
was inserted into the chamber to get rid of the cells on the
upper surface of the membrane. The cells were fixed using
100% ethanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The
migrated cells were counted in five selected fields under a
microscope at a 20x magnification.

GTTTTTG. The constructed pLKO.1 plasmid was then
introduced into 293FT cells together with the packaging
plasmid psPAX2 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA) and
the envelope plasmid pMD2.G (Addgene). After 48 h of
incubation, the medium containing the lentiviruses was
collected and passed through a 0.45-mm filter.

HepG2 and Hep3B cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).
MHCC97H cells were obtained from Dr. Z. Y. Tang
at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University (Shanghai,
People’s Republic of China) [43]. These cells were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine
serum and kept at 37°C in an atmosphere of 95% air and
5% CO2. To assess cell proliferation, 4 × 105 cells were
seeded in six-well plates. The cell number was determined
every other day using an automated cell counter.

Cell-cycle analysis
Cell-cycle analysis of synchronized cells was
monitored by examining the cells’ DNA profiles after staining
with propidium iodide. Cells were harvested, washed with 1×
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 70% cold ethanol
at 4°C for 10 min, hydrolyzed with 5 mg/ml ribonuclease
A for 20 min, and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide.
The DNA content in the cells was determined using a flow
cytometer (FACSVANTAGE; BD, San Jose, CA, USA)

Transfection of ATP1A1 siRNA
HCC cells were plated in 6-well and 96-well plates
and allowed to attach overnight. Transient transfection of
scramble siRNA and ATP1A1 siRNA molecules was carried
out using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent
(Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer.

weekly using calipers. The tumor volume was calculated
using the formula (a × b2) × 0.5, in which a and b are
the long and short dimensions, respectively. Both groups
contained 10 mice.

HepG2 cells (5 × 105) were seeded in a six-well
plate. After attachment, cells were transfected with
scrambled siRNA or ATP1A1-siRNA for 48 h. Total RNA
was then isolated from these cells using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The array analysis was
performed in triplicate by Sequencing and Microarray
Facility at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center (Houston, TX, USA).

Clinical samples
Human HCC and adjacent normal liver tissue
samples were collected at Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery
Hospital. All of the samples were collected after patients
gave their informed consent to participate, and all of the
experiments were approved by the institution’s Internal
Review and Ethics boards.

Western blots
Western blot analysis was performed according to
standard procedures using antibodies against ATP1A1
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and actin (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA).

Data analysis
Data were expressed as the mean ± SD. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the
normality of quantitative data. To analyze differences
between the two groups, Student t-test analysis of mean
numerical data and Mann-Whitney U-test analysis of
nonnumerical data were performed. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to compare the OS durations in the two
groups of patients. Data were analyzed using the SPSS
software program (version 20; IBM Corporation, Armonk,
NY, USA). P levels less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

ROS generation
Generation of intracellular ROS in HCC cells was
measured using H2DCF-DA. This nonpolar compound
is taken up by cells and converted via oxidation to the
nonfluorescent derivative DCF by cellular esterases.
HepG2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and transfected
with siRNA. Cells were then washed twice with phenol
red-free DMEM prior to the addition of H2DCF-DA to
cells for a final concentration of 10 μM. The fluorescence
intensity was then read using an FLx800 fluorescence
microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) with
excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 nm and
530 nm, respectively, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after siRNA
transfection. The fluorescence intensity was normalized
according to cell number. To determine the inhibitory
effect of an antioxidant on ATP1A1 downregulationmediated formation of ROS, cells were incubated with
10 mM NAC at 37°C for 30 min prior to the transfection
of siRNA.

Four-week-old male BALB/c-nu/nu nude mice were
purchased from the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica,
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, People’s
Republic of China) and housed in laminar flow cabinets
under specific pathogen-free conditions with food and
water provided ad libitum. All experiments involving
mice were performed in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of
laboratory animals. The study protocol was approved by
the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching
and Research at Fudan University. MHCC97H cells
transfected with nontargeted shRNA or ATP1A1-shRNA
(4 × 106 cells in a 200-μl volume) were injected into the
right and left axillae of individual mice. Tumor growth
was then examined for the following 40 days. The length
and width of the tumors (in millimeters) were measured
