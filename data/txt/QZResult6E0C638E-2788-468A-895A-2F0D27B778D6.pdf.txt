ABSTRACT
Despite of the great advances in anti-hypertensive therapies, many patients
under Renin-Angiotensin- System (RAS) suppression develop albuminuria, which is a
clear indicator of therapeutic inefficiency. Hence, indicators of vascular function are
needed to assess patients’ condition and help deciding future therapies.
Proteomic analysis of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) showed two
proteins, kalirin and chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7), increased
in albuminuric patients. A positive correlation of both with the expression of the
endothelial activation marker E-selectin was found in EVs. In vitro analysis using
TNFα-treated adult human endothelial cells proved their involvement in endothelial
cell activation.
Hence, we propose protein levels of kalirin and CHD7 in circulating EVs as
novel endothelial dysfunction markers to monitor vascular condition in hypertensive
patients with albuminuria.

INTRODUCTION

are a very useful tool to understand the processes taking
place in the secreting cell, especially in pathological
conditions, in which its release is enhanced [7]. EVs
include two different types of vesicles: 1) microvesicles
(MVs), 50 nm-1 μm vesicles which bud directly from the
plasma membrane; and 2) exosomes: 50–120 nm vesicles
released by fusion of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs)
to the plasma membrane [8]. EVs derived by either
platelets (PEVs) or endothelial cells (EEVs) are shed to
the bloodstream and increased number of both has been
associated with increased CV risk [9]. Furthermore, an
increased number of apoptotic EEVs has been recently
reported in hypertensive patients with albuminuria [10]
and increased shear stress might be the major cause of
such increase.

Albuminuria has been associated with increased
cardiovascular (CV) risk and allows monitoring
therapeutic efficiency in hypertensive patients, since a
substantial number of them develop de novo albuminuria
despite of the RAS suppression treatment [1]. These
patients show a characteristic inflammatory signature in
both plasma [2, 3] and urine [4]. In this context, increased
shear stress, endothelial dysfunction [5] and oxidative
stress [6] in the whole circulatory system arises and
therefore additional therapies need to be addressed to
prevent future events and avoid organ damage.
EVs are membrane vesicles released by secreting
cells to communicate with other cells. These vesicles

Differential analysis of EVs from hypertensive
patients with albuminuria

Circulating EVs may therefore constitute a lowinvasive tool for analysing the pathogenic processes
triggered by albuminuria. Using differential proteomic
analysis we have been able to identify kalirin and CHD7
to be increased in EVs from albuminuric patients.
In vitro analysis showed and proved their involvement
in endothelial cell (EC) activation within blood vessels.
Thus, we propose protein levels of kalirin and CHD7 in
circulating EVs as novel endothelial dysfunction markers
in hypertensive patients with albuminuria.

Differential abundance analysis was performed by
means of iTRAQ labelling and LC-MS/MS. To focus
in the alterations occurring with albuminuria onset, two
different groups attending to albuminuria development
were independently analysed: a) patients developing de
novo albuminuria during follow-up (dnA); b) patients
with sustained albuminuria during follow-up (SA) and a
nomoalbuminuric group was used as control (N). Table 1
Results showed 20 proteins significantly altered, among
which 19 were found in any of the albuminuric groups,
compared to the normoalbuminuric (Supplementary
Table S1). A principal component analysis (PCA) and
heatmap (Figure 2A and 2B) were performed using these
differential proteins. In the PCA (Figure 2A) the first
principal component greatly separates normoalbuminuric
patients from the albuminuric patients, showing that
the EVs from normoalbuminuric patients express very
different levels of proteins to those of the albuminuric. All
proteins were searched in two EVs databases: Vesiclepedia
and EVpedia, for prior evidence of expression by EVs,
either MVs or exosomes. Fourteen of them have been
previously reported to be expressed by EVs at the

RESULTS
Efficient isolation of EVs from blood of
hypertensive patients
The EV fraction obtained after isolation by
ultracentrifugation was checked by Electron Microscopy
(EM) confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. EM results
showed presence of vesicles ranging from 50 nm – 1 µm
size, which corresponded to both exosomes and MVs
(Figure 1, A1 and A2). Most abundant CD61+ PEVs were
imaged by confocal microscopy (Figure 1B) and these,
together with CD61−/CD31+ EMVs were detected by flow
cytometry (Figure 1C).

Figure 1: Isolation of EVs from blood plasma of hypertensive patients. Electron microscopy allowed to check presence
of all range of EVs: (A1), (15,000× magnification, scale bar 2 µm) vesicles of 0.1–1 µm size (microvesicles, MVs). (A2), (200,000×
magnification, scale bar 100 nm) vesicles of 40–100 nm, corresponding to exosomes as well as a small MV in the centre. (B) Confocal
microscopy analysis of CD61 allowed checking for the presence of platelet-derived MVs, which are the most abundant in the blood (63× oil
immersion objective, 1.4 zoom. Scale bar 1 µm). (C) Flow cytometry analysis was performed after defining a gate for EVs using Megamix
beads. EVs expressing CD61 (platelet-derived) and CD61−/CD31+ (endothelial-derived) were detected in the isolated fraction.

protein level, while the mRNA of another 4 (MAGUK
p55 subfamily member 4, MPP4; ORM1-like protein 2,
ORML2; CHD7; and XK-related protein 3) was shown
to be carried by these vesicles (Supplementary Table S1).
Two proteins have never been associated with EVs before
(Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase, CYLD; and
biorientation of chromosomes in cell division protein
1-like 1). Thus, we provide new evidence of the expression
of 6 proteins in EVs. Results from all quantified proteins
in EVs are shown in Supplementary Table S2.

vessel ECs, which might be more reliable than commonly
used human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). Expression of
CD62E and CD106 was substantially increased in TNF-α
treated cells compared to untreated controls as shown by
flow cytometry (Figure 3A). Flow cytometric analysis
of kalirin and CHD7 in TNF-α treated cells showed a
significant increase in the expression of both proteins
(p < 0.001) in all activated cells (CD62E+, CD106+ and
CD62E+/CD106+) as compared to the double negatives
(CD62E-/CD106−) (Figure 3B). Immunocytofluorescence
analysis of kalirin and CHD7, together with both activation
markers showed similar results to those observed by flow
cytometry and proved expression of the two proteins in
ECs (Figure 3C) as well as in EVs budding from TNF- α
activated cells (Figure 4A and 4B).

Confirmation by SRM of the increased
abundance of kalirin and CHD7 in EVs from
hypertensive patients with albuminuria and
analysis of correlation with E-selectin

DISCUSSION

Kalirin and CHD7 were analysed by SRM together
with the cellular marker of activated ECs, E-selectin
(CD62E). Quantification of these proteins was performed
in an independent cohort of 99 patients: 49 albuminuric
(25 dnA, 24 SA) and 50 normoalbuminuric. Both kalirin
and CHD7 were found to significantly increase in dnA
(Figure 2C and Table 2). The former was increased in SA
in a similar way, while levels of CHD7 in SA were similar
to those of normoalbuminuric patients. A significant
positive correlation of both proteins with CD62E was
found in EVs (Table 2).

The development of albuminuria during RAS
suppression involves increased shear stress [11], which
triggers endothelial activation and subsequent dysfunction
[5]. Besides, an increased oxidative stress has been
shown to occur in these patients [6]. Reactive oxygen
species (ROS) decrease endothelial nitric oxide (NO)
bioavailability [12], which also results in endothelial
dysfunction. On the other hand, endothelial activation
occurring in the kidney from hypertensive patients leads
to endothelial damage which reduces albumin filtration
and provokes albuminuria [13]. For all these reasons, new
indicators of albuminuria progression are needed to better
characterize vascular condition of hypertensive patients.
In this sense, analysis of proteins carried by circulating
EVs seems a very interesting approach, since shear stress
enhances release of EEVs [14] resulting in increased
levels in the bloodstream of albuminuric patients [10].

In vitro analysis of the expression of kalirin and
CHD7 in TNF-α treated ECFCs
In order to test the hypothesis that kalirin and CHD7
would increase in blood vessel ECs upon activation, ECs
were isolated from human saphenous vein. These primary
cultures provided us with an in vitro model of adult blood

Using a proteomics approach, we found 2 proteins,
kalirin and CHD7, increased in patients developing dnA,
which therefore may be indicators of the appearance
of albuminuria in hypertensive patients under RAS
blockage. Besides, a positive correlation of kalirin and
CHD7 with the endothelial activation marker CD62E
was also found. This result suggested these 2 proteins
may be released by endothelial cells upon activation via
EVs. We could confirm a significant increase in levels of
kalirin and CHD7 in activated ECs in vitro. This proves
an involvement of both proteins in endothelial cell
activation within blood vessels and explains the observed

increase in EVs from albuminuric patients, considering
the inherent endothelial dysfunction associated. The
results obtained in vitro showed a similar increase of
CHD7 and kalirin upon EC activation, but a recovery
in CHD7 up to normal levels was found in SA patients,
which point to a different behaviour of both proteins.
CHD7 seems to be an acute marker of endothelial
dysfunction, which explains the increase in de novo
albuminuria and the recovery in sustained albuminuria.
On the other hand, kalirin seems to be a more general
indicator of endothelial damage as increases in both
albuminuric groups.

Figure 2: EVs from hypertensive patients with albuminuria exhibit increased levels of kalirin and CHD7. (A) differential
analysis of EVs within N, dnA, and SA groups was performed by iTRAQ and LC-MS/MS. Proteins with log2 of Fold-change (Zq) values
± 1.5 (Fold-change = 3) were considered differentially expressed. PCA was performed using these differential proteins. The first principal
component greatly separates normoalbuminuric patients from the albuminuric patients, showing the EVs from normoalbuminuric patients
express very different levels of proteins to those of the albuminuric. (B) Heatmap showing relative quantifications of the significant
proteins. (C) Quantification of kalirin and CHD7 was performed by SRM in an independent cohort of 99 patients: 49 albuminuric (25 dnA,

Kalirin, also called Duo, is involved in signal
transduction. Its gene has been associated with
susceptibility of coronary artery disease [15] and ischemic
stroke [16]. Its expression by VSMCs has been associated
with neointimal hyperplasia in mice [17]. Here we provide,
for the first time, evidence of the expression of kalirin in
human ECs and of its involvement in processes leading to
endothelial dysfunction. Kalirin is known to inhibit iNOS
[17, 18] and the hypothesis that it may also suppress NO
availability in the endothelium by inhibiting eNOS is
reasonable and deserves further research. Interestingly,
NO release by ECs has been shown to decrease the release
of EEVs [14] and therefore a potential inhibition of NO
production triggered by kalirin is in accordance with both

the observed augment in activated ECs and circulating
EVs from albuminuric patients.
There is not much information to date about protein
CHD7 which functions as a transcriptional activator [19].
It is crucial during embryogenesis and has been involved
in heart and great vessel development [19, 20]. Mutations
in Chd7 gene are responsible for CHARGE syndrome,
in which, heart and vascular system are impaired [21].
Therefore, CHD7 is deeply involved in cardiovascular
system development and its correct function may be
important for a good cardiovascular condition. In our
work, increased expression of CHD7 by EVs has been
linked to albuminuria and endothelial activation. Indeed,
to date, there was no evidence of the expression of CHD7

alone for 5 h. (A, B) After activation, cells were trypsinized and labelled 1 h with the surface antibodies CD62E-APC and CD106-PE.
After this, cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized before incubating 90 min at 4°C with primary antibodies for the
intracellular proteins kalirin and CHD7. All samples were analysed in a FACS CANTO II (BD Biosciences).A, Flow cytometry of TNF-α
shows increased expression of the activation markers CD62E and CD106. B, Analysis of TNF-α activated cells by flow cytometry proved
a significant increase of both kalirin and CHD7 in cells expressing CD62E and/or CD106. Control cells for this experiment were CD62-/
CD106-. (C) Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized and labelled with CD62E-APC and CD106-PE as well as with

conjugated with Alexa-488 and Hoechst dye. Cells were visualized in a TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica). Immunofluorescence
analysis of TNF-α treated cells confirmed the increase of kalirin (C1) and CHD7 (C2) in cells expressing any or both of the activation
markers. All experiments were performed with at least n = 3. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. KALRN: kalirin, E-selectin = CD62E,

Patients’ recruitment

by ECs, which we hereby have proved by both flow
cytometry and immunofluorescence.
A limitation of our study might be the lack of sex
matching among populations in the confirmation phase.
We have anyway taken into consideration the existing
differences in the correlation of albuminuria levels and
disease state by adjusting albuminuria ranges according
to gender, as a way of correcting this limitation. Further
studies in greater cohorts will allow to assess potential of
these biomarkers and evaluate influence of gender.
The hereby presented results support a potential
involvement of kalirin and CHD7 proteins in human blood
vessel endothelial dysfunction and show an increased
expression of both by circulating EVs in albuminuric
patients (Figure 4C). Hence, we propose levels of
these proteins in circulating EVs as novel endothelial
dysfunction markers to monitor vascular condition in
hypertensive patients with albuminuria.

Patient selection and classification was previously
described [1–4]. Briefly, 121 patients hypertensive
patients with (n = 63) or without albuminuria (n = 58)
were recruited between January 2012 and June 2013 after
being followed for a minimum period of 3  years with
visits to the Hypertension Unit, Hospital Universitario
12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain; at least, every 6 months.
After that, the patients continued with their annual
revisions. Patients were classified according to high
albuminuria development during follow-up in 3 groups:
(a) patients with persistent normoalbuminuria (N, n =
58); (b) patients developing de novo albuminuria during
follow-up (dnA, n = 32); (c) patients with sustained
albuminuria during follow-up (SA, n = 31). Characteristics
and medications of the specific cohorts recruited for the
discovery and confirmation phase are given in Table 1
A human saphenous vein from revascularization surgery at
Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain; was collected
for isolation of the ECs addressed for primary cultures.
The study was conducted according to
recommendations of Declaration of Helsinki and approved

Isolation and TNF-α activation of ECs

by the local Ethics Committee. Informed consent was
requested from subjects prior to inclusion in the study.

ECs were isolated from human saphenous vein and
grown as previously described [23]. Endothelial phenotype
of ECs was checked by flow cytometry and confocal
microscopy (Supplementary Figure S1). For stimulating
ECs, cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2,
treated with 10 ng/ml tumour necrosis factor- α (TNF-α)
or EC-medium alone for 5 h.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolation
EVs were isolated as previously described [22], with
minor modifications. For more details see Supplementary
material.

Electron microscopy (EM)

Flow cytometry

The precipitate of EVs obtained by ultracentrifugation
was fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% and visualized after
negative staining in a JEM 1010 (JEOL Peabody, MA,
USA).

EVs were analysed by flow cytometry using platelet
marker CD61 (most abundant source of EVs in blood).
EVs gate was defined using MegaMix SSC Plus beads
(Biocytex).
For analysing ECs, cells were trypsinized after
stimulation and labelled with the surface antibodies for
E-selectin: CD62E-APC; and VCAM-1: CD106-PE as
well as with either of the intracellular proteins kalirin
and CHD7; followed by a donkey anti-rabbit secondary
antibody conjugated with Alexa-488.
All samples were analysed in a FACS CANTO II
(BD Biosciences). Experiment was repeated 3 times.

iTRAQ labelling
To focus in the alterations occurring with
albuminuria onset, two different groups attending to
albuminuria development were independently analysed
(dnA and SA, n = 14, 7 of each group). A nomoalbuminuric
group (n = 8) was used as control. In order to analyse
four samples per group, EVs from 2 patients were pooled
when necessary. Two different 8-plex experiments were
performed to process all the analysed sample pools. In
every experiment two reference samples, each composed
of a pool of 4 samples obtained from healthy blood donors,
were labelled with the tags 113 and 117, in order to
normalize quantifications and secure accurate comparison
of samples between experiments. The tags addressed to
label every sample are available on Supplementary Table
S3.

Confocal microscopy
For visualizing EVs staining of CD61 or its isotype
control was assayed. For ECs analysis, cells were seeded
in coverslips and treated with TNF-α or EC-medium
alone. Detection of EC activation markers E-selectin and
VCAM-1 was accomplished, together with either of the
intracellular staining of kalirin or CHD7 using the same
antibodies employed for flow cytometry.
EVs and cells were visualized in a TCS SP5
confocal microscope (Leica). All experiments were
performed with n = 3.

LC-MS/MS and differential analysis
Labelled peptide samples were analysed by LCMS/MS in a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Protein quantification from reporter ion
intensities and statistical analysis were performed using
QuiXoT software. All the significant proteins found in
the differential analysis were searched against two EVs
databases: Vesiclepedia and EVpedia in order to find
previous evidence of their expression in EVs, both MVs
and exosomes, at the protein or mRNA level.

Statistical analysis
Values for patients’ characteristics are expressed
as means ± standard deviation (SD) or percentages. Oneway ANOVA was used to calculate statistically significant
differences of the values between different groups. Posthoc analysis of significant ANOVA results was performed
by means of Tukey analysis. In iTRAQ results, we have
considered differentially expressed those proteins with
log2 of Fold-change (Zq) values ± 1.5 (Fold-change = 3).
For in vitro analyses, Student’s T-test was performed and
each experiment was repeated 3 times.
All statistics were calculated using SPSS 15.0
software, except for PCA and heatmap, which were done
with XLSTAT for Excel (Microsoft).

SRM confirmation
For confirmation, EVs from an independent cohort
of 99 patients were analysed by SRM: 49 albuminuric
(25  dnA, 24 SA) and 50 normoalbuminuric. SRM
transitions (3 per peptide) were monitored during an
individual sample analysis (SRM peptides analysed
and settings are shown in Supplementary Table S4 and
chromatograms in Supplementary Figure S2).
