BACKGROUND: In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), testing for fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)–internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1) mutations can allow for further prognostic subclassification, but less is known about the
effects of FLT3-ITD allele burden and presenting white blood cell count (WBC) within molecular subgroups. METHODS: The authors
retrospectively assessed 206 adult patients who had AML with an intermediate-risk karyotype and who received treatment on a uniform induction and consolidation chemotherapy regimen. RESULTS: The presenting WBC was a prognostic factor for survival only in
patients who had an FLT3-ITD mutation. On multivariate analysis, after correcting for age, WBC, secondary AML, and blast percentage, nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1)-mutated/FLT3-ITD–negative patients had superior overall survival compared with patients in the other
molecular subgroups. Patients who had FLT3-ITD mutations had an inferior overall survival compared with patients who had NPM1
wild-type/FLT3-negative disease, and patients who had low or intermediate levels of the FLT-ITD of mutant allele had overall and disease-free survival similar to those in patients who had high-level mutations. CONCLUSIONS: NPM1 and FLT3-ITD status, age, WBC,
and secondary AML were identified as important prognostic variables that can help to risk stratify patients with AML who have intermediate-risk cytogenetics. FLT3 allele burden had no significant influence on outcomes after correcting for other variables. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with intermediate-risk cytogenetics encompasses a heterogeneous population of patients
whose prognosis has recently been further defined by molecular aberrations. Mutations in the nucleophosmin-1 gene
(NPM1) are present in 35% to 50% of such patients and confer a survival advantage and lower risk of relapse.1-3 Conversely, an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) gene (FLT3-ITD) occurs in
approximately 25% to 30% of patients and has an adverse impact on the relapse rate and overall survival (OS).4-6 Results
of analyses for such mutations often are used to assess prognosis and to direct therapy, most notably the decision regarding
whether patients should undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT).
Several studies have suggested that the FLT3-ITD allele burden also may have prognostic significance.6,7 A Medical
Research Council study indicted that higher FLT3-ITD levels were correlated with higher relapse rates and worse OS, particularly when a high level (>50% allele burden) of FLT3-ITD was present6; however, that analysis included the entire
cohort rather than the intermediate-risk cytogenetic group alone. Thus, many questions remain about the prognostic
implications of FLT3-ITD levels in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics.
Traditionally, it has been held that an elevated presenting white blood cell count (WBC) is a poor risk factor.8-10
However, because FLT3-ITD mutations are associated with a higher WBC, it is unclear whether the WBC remains an important predictor of survival in each of the molecularly defined subgroups. It would be important to know whether the
presenting WBC modifies the risk associated with the aforementioned mutations to determine whether postremission
therapy needs to be tailored accordingly. Therefore, we sought to clarify the effect of FLT3-ITD level, NPM1 status, and
presenting WBC in a population of patients with AML who had intermediate-risk cytogenetics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment

We used a database of adult patients who were treated
at Princess Margaret Hospital between 2002 and 2010
to identify 206 patients with adult AML who had an
intermediate-risk karyotype based on Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria, as previously
described, 11 and who received induction chemotherapy. Approval of the hospital institutional review
board was obtained before initiating this retrospective
analysis.
For patients aged <60 years, induction chemotherapy consisted of cytarabine 200 mg/m2 daily as a 7-day
continuous intravenous infusion and daunorubicin 60
mg/m2 intravenously daily  3 days. Patients who
achieved complete remission (CR) received 2 cycles of
consolidation, each of which included intravenous cytarabine 3 g/m2 over 3 hours every 12 hours for 6 doses on
days 1, 3, and 5 in combination with intravenous daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 daily  2 days.
Patients aged 60 years received the same induction regimen but with a cytarabine dose of 100 mg/m2
daily. Those who achieved CR then received 2 consolidations, the first of which was the same as the induction
regimen; the second consisted of intravenous mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 daily for 5 days and intravenous etoposide 100 mg/m2 daily for 5 days (NOVE).
Patients who did not achieve CR with induction
therapy and who were deemed fit to receive a reinduction
regimen received combined mitoxantrone, etoposide, and
high-dose cytarabine (NOVE-HiDAC), as previously
described.12 The decision to proceed to alloSCT in first
CR (CR1) was based on donor availability and the clinical
judgment of the treating physician. In the event of relapse,
physicians opted for various modalities, including reinduction with or without alloSCT in second CR (CR2),
enrollment onto a clinical trial, or supportive therapy
alone.

Response and Outcome Criteria

Response to treatment was assessed using International
Working Group criteria.13 CR was defined as a postinduction BM with <5% blasts, a peripheral blood platelet
count >100  109/L, an absolute neutrophil count >1.0
 109/L, and the absence of extramedullary disease. OS
was calculated from the initiation of first induction treatment for AML to the date of either death or last followup. Disease-free survival (DFS) was determined only for
patients who achieved CR and was measured from the
Cancer

date of CR1 achievement until the date of death, relapse,
or last follow-up.
Molecular Testing

Total cellular RNA was extracted from the peripheral
blood using a PerfectPure RNA Blood Kit (5 PRIME,
Inc., Gaithersburg, Md), then reverse-transcribed into
cDNA using random hexamers and Moloney murine
leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase. Multiplex
polymerase chain reaction analysis for FLT3 and NPM1
was performed using fluorescent primers specific for the
FLT3 gene and NPM1 gene. FLT3-ITD and NPM1
insertions were identified using fragment analysis on an
ABI Genetic Analyzer 3100/3130 platform (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). FLT3-ITD was quantified by determining the quantity of mutant allele as a
percentage of total allele burden (wild-type plus
mutated). A negative FLT3-ITD test was 1 that fell
below the threshold of detection (<5%). A low level of
mutant allele (FLT3þ[L]) was defined as 5% but
<25%, an intermediate level (FLT3þ[I]) was defined as
25% but <50%, and a high level (FLT3þ[H]) was
defined as50%. The lower limit of sensitivity of the
NPM1 assay was 1% to 10%.
Statistical Analysis

Differences in demographic variables according to mutation status were investigated using the Fisher exact test for
categorical variables, such as prior disease and sex, and the
Kruskal-Wallis test for age, WBC, and BM blast percentage. OS and DFS probabilities were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in survival curves were
compared using a 2-sided log-rank test. Cox proportional
hazards regression models were used to examine the effect
of mutation status on OS and DFS after adjusting for age,
WBC, prior disease, and BM blast percentage. Statistical
interactions were investigated to explore whether the
effect of WBC on OS and DFS changed depending on
mutation status. Simple effect analyses reported the effect
of WBC for each mutation group status. The association
between concurrent NPM1 and FLT3 mutations and differences in CR rates were investigated using the Fisher
exact test. For the patients who had FLT3 mutations, a
Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to detect
whether CR rates consistently increased as the level of
FLT3 burden increased. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and the open-source R statistical software package (version 2.12.1; R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A 2-sided P
value < .05 was used to assess statistical significance.

RESULTS
Patients

Demographics for the 206 patients as well as a breakdown
according to NPM1 and FLT3 status are provided in
Table 1. There were 68 patients (33%) who tested positive
for FLT3-ITD mutations (FLT3þ). Patients with FLT3
mutations, regardless of level, were more likely to have
concurrent NPM1 mutations than patients who were
FLT3-negative (FLT3) (59% vs 37.7%; P ¼ .0082).
The median BM blast percentage was similar among the
molecular subgroups (P ¼ .313). There was no correlation between the FLT3 allele burden and BM blast percentage (Spearman correlation, 0.22). Cytogenetics were
normal in 195 patients (95%); and abnormalities
included chromosome 8 gain (þ8) (n ¼ 5), chromosome
Y loss (Y) (n ¼ 2), and þY, þX, þ7, and loss of the
short arm of chromosome 12 (12p) (n ¼ 1 each).
Treatment Outcomes

Of all 206 patients, 155 (75.2%) achieved CR with 1
induction. Eight patients (3.9%) died during induction.
Of the 43 patients (20.9%) who had persistent leukemia
after first induction, 37 were reinduced and 24 (64.9%)
achieved CR after this second induction. Thus, the total
CR rate with 2 inductions was 86.9%. Of the patients
who achieved CR, 3 older patients were not candidates for
consolidation and either received low-dose cytarabine
alone (n ¼ 2) or were observed without treatment (n ¼
6112

1); all remaining patients received consolidation therapy
on protocol.
In total, 24 patients underwent alloSCT in CR1, 15
from human leukemic antigen (HLA)-matched sibling
donors and 9 from HLA-matched unrelated donors. Most
of these patients (n ¼ 20) were aged <60 years and
received myeloablative conditioning using a variety of regimens. Patients aged 60 years (n ¼ 4) received reducedintensity conditioning. Among the patients who underwent transplantation in CR1, 2 were in the FLT3þ(H)
subgroup, 6 were in the combined low-intermediate
FLT3-ITD (FLT3þ[L-I]) subgroup, 12 were in the wildtype NPM1 (NPM1)/FLT3 subgroup, and 4 were in
the NPM1þ/FLT3 subgroup.
The median follow-up of the entire group was 26.4
months. Of the 179 patients who achieved CR, 98
patients (54.7%) relapsed. Among these, 70 patients were
reinduced and 41 patients (58.6%) achieved CR2; 16 of
these patients were consolidated with alloSCT in CR2 or
later. The median OS of the entire cohort of 206 patients
was 21.2 months (95% confidence interval, 16.9-30.5
months), and 117 patients (56.8%) died.
Influence of Molecular Status on the Complete
Remission Rate

Patients who were NPM1þ were more likely to obtain
CR with up to 2 inductions than those who had wild-type
NPM1 (CR rate 95.5% vs 81.3%; P ¼ .0023).

Conversely, FLT3-ITD status did not significantly affect
CR rates for the negative, low, intermediate, and high
groups, which had CR rates of 91.3%, 70%, 76%, and
86.9%, respectively (P ¼ .09).
Influence of Molecular Status on Survival

Figure 1a indicates that patients in the NPM1þ/FLT3
subgroup had superior OS compared with all other subgroups, with a 3-year OS rate of 61%. Patients who were
both NPM1 and FLT3 (defined as the double-negative group) had a 3-year OS rate of 37%. Patients who
had a low, intermediate, or high levels of FLT3-ITD,
regardless of NPM1 status, had 3-year OS rates of 25%,
25%, and 12%, respectively. Comparing the low and intermediate level FLT3-ITD groups, the hazard ratio for
OS was 0.898 (P ¼ .759), indicating that these 2 groups
did not differ in their outcomes. Thus, these 2 groups
were combined for further analysis. This combined
FLT3þ(L-I) subgroup had OS that was similar to that in
the FLT3þ(H) subgroup but significantly worse OS than
the double-negative group (Table 2).

CR1 (n ¼ 119), as indicated in Figure 1b. In this cohort,
patients in the NPM1þ/FLT3 subgroup continued to
have significantly superior OS (3-year OS rate, 75%).
The OS rate in the FLT3þ(H) subgroup, again, was significantly inferior to that in the double-negative subgroup
(hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; P ¼ .017), but it was not significantly different from the OS in the combined FLT3þ(LI) subgroup (HR, 1.42; P ¼ .330).
The DFS according to molecular subgroup is illustrated in Figure 2. The low and intermediate level FLT3ITD groups again had similar DFS and, thus, were combined into an FLT3þ(L-I) subgroup for further analysis.
The NPM1þ/FLT3 subgroup had a 3-year DFS rate of
47%, which was significantly superior to that in the other
subgroups; the DFS rate for the double-negative,
FLT3þ(L-I), and FLT3þ(H) subgroups were 22%, 26%,
and 10%, respectively (log-rank P ¼ .000035 comparing
all 4 subgroups). DFS was significantly inferior in the
FLT3þ(H) subgroup compared with both the doublenegative subgroup and the FLT3þ(L-I) subgroup. Unlike
OS, DFS did not differ between the double-negative and
FLT3þ(L-I) subgroups (Table 2).
In the cohort of patients aged <60 years who did
not undergo transplantation in CR1, DFS remained significantly better in the NPM1þ/FLT3 subgroup; similarly, the FLT3þ(H) subgroup continued a trend toward
worse DFS compared with double-negative subgroup
(HR, 1.86; P ¼ .076) and the combined FLT3þ(L-I)
subgroup (HR, 1.63; P ¼ .20). There was no significant

variable had a significant negative effect on both OS (HR,
1.01; P ¼ .0077) and DFS (HR, 1.01; P ¼ .035) in the
FLT3þ(H) subgroup. Similarly, a WBC 50  109/L
remained a negative prognostic factor for both OS (HR,
3.40; P ¼ .001) and DFS (HR, 3.01 P ¼ .0075) in the
FLT3þ(L-I) subgroup; whereas a WBC 100  109/L
became a significant negative prognostic factor in the
FLT3þ(H) subgroup for both OS (HR, 3.79; P ¼ .028)
and DFS (HR, 4.349; P ¼ .015).

FLT3þ(L-I) subgroups.
Influence of Presenting White Blood Cell Count

The WBC at presentation was analyzed both as a continuous variable and using cutoffs values of 50  109/L and
100  109/L. Table 3 indicates that the WBC had no
influence on either OS or DFS in both the NPM1þ/
FLT3 and double-negative subgroups when analyzed either as a continuous variable or using specific cutoff values. When analyzed as a continuous variable, a high WBC
was associated with significantly inferior OS in the
FLT3þ(H) subgroup and the FLT3þ(L-I) subgroup.
When analyzed as a dichotomous variable, a WBC 50
 109/L was a negative prognostic factor in the
FLT3þ(L-I) subgroup for both OS and DFS, and a WBC
100  109/L was a negative prognostic factor for OS in
the FLT3þ(H) and FLT3þ(L-I) subgroups.
This effect was maintained in the cohort of patients
aged <60 years who did not undergo alloSCT in CR1
(data not shown), in which a higher WBC as a continuous

In a multivariate Cox regression analysis that evaluated
mutation status, age, WBC, prior disease (de novo vs secondary), and BM blast percentage, all variables except
BM blast percentage remained significant predictors of
outcome for both OS and DFS, as indicated in Table 4.
The NPM1þ/FLT3 subgroup continued to fare better
than all other molecular subgroups. Correcting for age,
WBC, and disease status, there remained only a nonsignificant trend toward inferior DFS in the FLT3þ(H) subgroup compared with the FLT3þ(L-I) subgroup, but OS
did not differ between these 2 subgroups. Both the
FLT3þ(L-I) and FLT3þ(H) subgroups continued to
have worse OS compared with the double-negative subgroup, whereas DFS remained similar between the
FLT3þ(L-I) and double-negative subgroups.
Within the FLT3þ subgroup, multivariate analysis
was also performed to assess survival using FLT3 allele
burden as a continuous variable. In this model, FLT3 burden did not significantly influence OS or DFS within the
FLT3þ population when adjusting for presenting WBC,
age, and prior disease (Table 5). The WBC remained a
significant predictor of OS within the FLT3þ subgroup.
Furthermore, correcting FLT3 burden for the BM blast
percentage did not alter the results; the ratio of FLT3 allele burden to BM blast percentage did not significantly
predict for OS or DFS (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this retrospective study, we analyzed patients with AML
who had intermediate-risk cytogenetics and identified 4
molecularly defined subgroups: 1) an NPM1þ/FLT3
subgroup, which that had significantly superior OS and
DFS compared with all other subgroups; 2) a double-negative cohort, in whom OS and DFS were inferior to those of
the NPM1þ/FLT3 subgroup but superior to those of the
FLT3þ(H) subgroup (this subgroup had comparable DFS
but significantly better OS compared with the FLT3þ[L-I]
subgroup); 3) the combined FLT3þ(L-I) cohort, which
had similar OS but significantly better DFS (on univariate

blast percentage on multivariate analysis. This finding was
confirmed using traditional, predefined cutoff values for
FLT3 burden and using FLT3 burden as a continuous
variable. Thus, it is likely that the differences observed on
univariate analysis were related to the higher median
WBC in the FLT3þ(H) subgroup. However, it is also
possible that the absence of a detectable difference on
multivariate analysis was related to the small numbers in
each cohort as well as a confounding influence of NPM1
mutations in these FLT3þ groups. We also cannot rule
out the possibility that some of the less significant differences observed were related to the number of statistical
comparisons done.
In a recent study, de Jonge et al observed that the
WBC did not significantly affect outcome in either the
NPM1þ/FLT3 or the double-negative subgroup.14
Our results confirm their findings, because we observed
no significant effect of the presenting WBC, either as a
continuous variable or as a dichotomous variable using
several predefined cutoff levels. That study by de Jonge et
al demonstrated that using a cutoff of 100  109/L, the
WBC was a significant prognostic factor for FLT3þ
patients who were NPM1þ but not in FLT3þ patients
with wild-type NPM1. In our study, we chose to analyze
patients within the FLT3þ subgroup according to FLT3
allele burden rather than NPM1 status. With this
approach, we observed that a high presenting WBC was
an independent, adverse prognostic variable in both the
FLT3þ(L-I) and FLT3þ(H) subgroups, and this effect
was maintained on multivariate analysis. This influence of
WBC on OS remained significant when FLT3 allele burden was assessed on a continuum. In our study, we did
not have enough patients to analyze the influence of

WBC according to NPM1 status within these FLT3þ
subgroups.
Clinically, these results can assist in decision making
regarding alloSCT and its timing. Schlenk et al demonstrated that patients who are either FLT3-ITDþ or who
are negative for both FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations
have a superior outcome if they have a potential alloSCT
donor compared with those without a donor.15 Our
results suggest that the presenting WBC should not be
used to modify the decision to undergo alloSCT in either
the NPM1þ/FLT3 cohort or the double-negative
cohort: Those with NPM1þ/FLT3 findings should not
be referred for transplantation on the basis of a high WBC
alone; conversely, patients in the double-negative group
should not have a transplantation withheld simply
because they presented with a normal or low WBC.
Although our double-negative cohort had a longer CR1
duration than the FLT3þ subgroups, these patients continued to relapse as late as 3 and 4 years postremission
and, ultimately, their DFS remained unfavorable.
In contrast, patients who had a high FLT3 allele burden tended to relapse earlier, usually in the first 6 to 12
months after achieving CR. After correcting for the WBC
on multivariate analysis, the DFS between the FLT3(H)
and FLT3(L-I) subgroups became similar. This suggests
that members of either subgroup, particularly those with
higher WBC, should undergo transplantation as quickly
as possible and that perhaps these patients should remain
on consolidation therapy for a longer period until a suitable donor is identified. Several published reports have
argued against the prognostic value of a low-intermediate
level of FLT3.6,16 Our results support the Medical
Research Council study6 and indicate that a low-intermediate level of FLT3-ITD positivity confers a worse prognosis than the absence of mutated FLT3-ITD.
Furthermore, after correcting for WBC, patients who had
a low-intermediate allele burden fared as poorly as those
with a high allele burden, indicating that the presence of
FLT3-ITD, rather than its level, is what confers prognostic importance.
The outcomes in our study population were somewhat inferior to those in other published reports, particularly with respect to DFS in the aged <60 years, doublenegative cohort. It is possible that our results are a better
reflection of treatment outcomes in an unselected AML
population than what may be observed in a controlled
trial setting. It is also possible that the use of 2 consolidation cycles, compared with the 4 cycles used in previous
reports,17 may have contributed to a higher relapse rate.
Finally, outcomes in this subgroup may have been

influenced by the presence of additional, recently identified mutations that reportedly affect prognosis, such as
CEPBA,18 TET2,19 IDH1 and IDH220,21 and RUNX1.22
Further studies will be required to determine the potential
roles of such mutations in decision-making regarding
alloSCT.
