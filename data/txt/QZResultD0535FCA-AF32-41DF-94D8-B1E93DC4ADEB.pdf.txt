ABSTRACT
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor has been a promising therapeutic option
in cancer therapy due to its ability to induce growth arrest, differentiation, and
apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that MPT0E028, a novel HDAC inhibitor,
reduces the viability of B-cell lymphomas by inducing apoptosis and shows a more
potent HDAC inhibitory effect compared to SAHA, the first HDAC inhibitor approved
by the FDA. In addition to HDACs inhibition, MPT0E028 also possesses potent direct
Akt targeting ability as measured by the kinome diversity screening assay. Also,
MPT0E028 reduces Akt phosphorylation in B-cell lymphoma with an IC50 value lower
than SAHA. Transient transfection assay revealed that both targeting HDACs and Akt
contribute to the apoptosis induced by MPT0E028, with both mechanisms functioning
independently. Microarray analysis also shows that MPT0E028 may regulate many
oncogenes expression (e.g., TP53, MYC, STAT family). Furthermore, in vivo animal
model experiments demonstrated that MPT0E028 (50–200 mg/kg, po, qd) prolongs
the survival rate of mice bearing human B-cell lymphoma Ramos cells and inhibits
tumor growth in BJAB xenograft model. In summary, MPT0E028 possesses strong in
vitro and in vivo activity against malignant cells, representing a potential therapeutic
approach for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

radiotherapy. However, monoclonal antibodies often result
in relapse and resistance due to a variety of molecular
mechanisms. Therefore, discovery and development of
novel anticancer agents to improve overall survival in
cancer patients becomes an essential and urgent medical
need. Target therapy, employing proteasome inhibitors,
mTOR inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and histone
deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), plays an important role in
clinical oncology [2], suggesting these pathways represent

According to the American Cancer Society, B-cell
lymphomas make up approximately 85 percent of nonHodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in the United States [1].
Current strategies for the treatment of NHLs include the
use of monoclonal antibodies (e.g., rituximab), either as
single agent or in combination with chemotherapy and

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of
enzymes that remove the acetyl group from histone
lysine tails, leading to chromatin condensation and
transcriptional repression. At present, there are four
classes of HDACs: class I (HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) mainly
localizes in the nucleus; class II (IIa: HDAC4, 5, 7, and 9;
IIb: HAC6, and 10) may shuttle between cytoplasm and
nucleus. Class III HDACs, also known as sirtuins (sirtuins
1–7), requires NAD+ as a cofactor for enzymatic activity;
however, HDAC11 is the sole member of HDAC11. Class
I, II, and IV are classical HDACs which need Zn2+ for
enzymatic activity and are inhibited by HDAC inhibitors
that chelate Zn2+ ion in their catalytic sites. HDAC
inhibitors have multiple mechanisms of inducing cell
cycle arrest, cell differentiation, and cell death through
apoptosis, autophagy, or necrosis in many cancer cells.
They have also shown to inhibit angiogenesis, migration,
and metastasis [3, 4]. Consequently, HDAC inhibitors,
proven to be particularly effective against hematological
malignancies in clinical trials, are increasingly perceived
as promising anticancer agents [5]. Vorinostat [6] and
Romidepsin [7] are two HDAC inhibitors recently
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).
Upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
occurs in many human cancers, including lymphoma;
therefore, this pathway is considered a target for anticancer
therapy in several human cancer types [8]. Activation of
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) enables recruitment
of the serine/threonine kinase Akt to the cell membrane
and then phosphorylates and activates Akt. Akt then
activates the downstream protein mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), which phosphorylates translation
initiation through ribosomal p70S6 kinase (p70S6k)
or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)
binding proteins (4E-BPs). This promotes dissociation
from the translation factor eIF4E, which stimulates
RNA translation. On the other hand, Akt could activate
GSK3β to manipulate cell cycle and glucose metabolism
[9]. Akt is also a key regulator promoting cell growth
and cell survival [10], which dysregulated causes tumor
progression in many cancers. Therefore, many Akt
inhibitors are being developed for clinical investigation
[11].
MPT0E028 (3-(1-Benzenesulfonyl-2,3-dihydro1H-indol-5-yl)-N-hydroxy-acrylamide) is a novel HDAC
inhibitor in vitro and in vivo with a potent and broad
HDAC inhibitory effect in multiple human cancers, both
alone and in combination with other treatments [12-14].
In this study, we show that MPT0E028 possesses a more
potent inhibitory effect against HDACs and greater ability
in targeting Akt compared with the HDAC inhibitor
vorinostat (SAHA) in human B-cell lymphoma cells.
In an in vivo study, MPT0E028 prolonged the survival
rate of mice bearing human lymphoma Ramos cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and significantly suppressed human lymphoma BJAB
tumor xenograft growth; using the same dose, the effect
of SAHA was considerably weaker. According to our
previous findings and encouraging results, MPT0E028
manifests potent preclinical activity against human B-cell
lymphoma, making this HDAC inhibitor a promising
agent for hematologic cancer treatment.

RESULTS
MPT0E028 induces apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma
cells
First, we assayed two human B-cell lymphoma
cells, Ramos and BJAB, for viability and human normal
HUVEC cells for toxicity in the presence of various
concentrations of MPT0E028 and SAHA for comparison.
MPT0E028 (Fig. 1A) showed no toxic effect on human
normal HUVEC cells (IC50 > 30 µM) (Fig. 1B), but
induced significant concentration-dependent growth
inhibition both in Ramos (IC50 = 0.65 ± 0.1 µM) and
BJAB lymphoma cells (IC50 = 1.45 ± 0.5 µM) compared
with SAHA (IC50 = 2.61 ± 0.4 and 44.22 ± 10.0µM in
Ramos and BJAB cells, respectively) (Fig. 1C). We also
used FACS cytometry to analyze cell cycle progression
and found that MPT0E028 substantially increased the
subG1 phase population in a time- and concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 1D). Further, we used western
blot analysis to characterize several caspases and PARP
activation following the treatment of MPT0E028 at the
indicated time. The results show that MPT0E028 induced
caspase-3 and PARP cleavages, as well as caspase-6,
-7, -8, and -9 activation in both cells (Fig. 1E). The data
are consistent with that of flow cytometry, suggesting
that MPT0E028 may induce apoptotic cell death. Taken
together, MPT0E028 substantially induces growth
inhibition and apoptosis more efficaciously than SAHA
in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in human
B- cell lymphoma cells.

MPT0E028 inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC)
enzyme activity and induces apoptosis through
HDAC inhibition
We have previously determined that MPT0E028 is
a pan-HDAC inhibitor through direct HDAC targeting
[12]. In our previous study, we used an enzyme-based
HDAC fluorescence activity assay to detect five isoforms
of HDACs: HDAC1, 2, and 8 from class I; HDAC4 from
class IIa; and HDAC6 from class IIb. The results showed
that MPT0E028 inhibited HDAC1, 2, 6, and 8 with an IC50
value in the nanomolar range (29.48–2532.57 nM) but had
no effect upon HDAC4, representing a more potent HDAC

inhibitory spectrum than SAHA [12]. In the present study,
we assessed HDAC enzyme activity under treatment of
MPT0E028 and SAHA in human B-cell lymphoma by
using cell-based HDAC fluorescence activity assay. As
shown in Fig. 2A, MPT0E028 effectively inhibited HDAC
enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner
(IC50 = 2.88 ± 1.9 µM in Ramos, 4.54 ± 1.2 µM in BJAB),
whereas the inhibitory activity of SAHA was much weaker
(IC50= 143.48 ± 67.4 µM in Ramos, 149.66 ± 40.3 µM in
BJAB). Protein expression of HDAC1, 2, and 4 was also
slightly downregulated after 24 h treatment of MPT0E028
in both cell lines, whereas HDAC6 was downregulated
in Ramos cells but only slightly cleaved in BJAB cells,
as determined by western blotting (Fig. 2B). Biomarkers
of HDAC inhibition, which include hyperacetylation of
histone 3, α-tubulin, and upregulation of p21 expression
[15], were all detected under treatment of MPT0E028 in
a time-dependent manner in both Ramos and BJAB cells
(Fig. 2B). To determine whether inhibition of HDACs is
involved in the apoptosis induced by MPT0E028, transient
transfection was performed using flag-tagged pcHDAC1,
4, and 6 for HDAC coexpression and pcDNA3.1 vector
as control. As shown in Fig. 2C, HDAC1, 4, and 6 were
all transfected successfully, and the acetylation level of
histone 3 and α-tubulin were reversed when HDACs were
coexpressed (Fig. 2D). MPT0E028-induced caspase 3
and PARP activation were also abolished by coexpressing
HDACs (Fig. 2E), suggesting that MPT0E028 induces
human B-cell lymphoma cells apoptosis through inhibition
of HDACs.

lines. To exploit the detailed mechanisms of p-Akt (S473)
dephosphorylated by MPT0E028, we focused on BJAB
cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, the effect of MPT0E028 on
Akt dephosphorylation is about 6 times more potent than
SAHA using the cell-based ELISA assay (MPT0E028,
IC50 = 5.90 ± 1.6 µM; SAHA, IC50 = 32.89 ± 11.3 µM).
To assess the role of Akt in MPT0E028-induced cell
apoptosis, we examined the effect of overexpressing
Akt on rescuing MPT0E028-induced apoptotic death by
transiently transfect BJAB cells with constitutively active
myr-Akt. Transfection of myr-Akt effectively reversed the
inhibition effect of MPT0E028 on Akt phosphorylation
and its downstream protein activation of p-mTOR and
p-GSK3β (Fig. 3D). Moreover, caspase 3 and PARP
activation were also abolished when overexpressing Akt in
MPT0E028- and SAHA-treated cells (Fig. 3E), confirming
that Akt plays a part in MPT0E028-induced cell apoptosis.
These results suggest that MPT0E028 induced apoptotic
cell death not only by inhibition of HDAC activity but also
by directly targeting the Akt-dependent pathway in human
B-cell lymphoma cells.

Correlation between HDAC and Akt inhibition of
MPT0E028 on cell apoptosis
It has been reported that HDAC inhibitors may
cause Akt depletion through modulation of gene
expression [16] and inhibit Akt phosphorylation through
disruption of HDAC-PP1 (protein-phosphatase 1)
complex [17]. In this study, we aimed to determine the
relationship between HDAC and Akt under the inhibitory
effect of MPT0E028. First, we transfected BJAB cells
with pcHDAC1, pcHDAC4, and pcHDAC6 (Fig. 4A),
respectively, to further examine the individual role of
HDACs in MPT0E028-inhibited Akt and downstream
proteins activation. As shown in Fig. 4B, even though
MPT0E028-inhibited p-Akt (S473) was slightly reversed
when overexpressing HDAC1 and 6 in BJAB cells, the
downstream protein p-mTOR did not reverse in any
obvious fashion. The results indicated that MPT0E028
did not inhibit Akt phosphorylation through HDAC
inhibition. We then transfected BJAB cells with myrAkt to examine the role of Akt in rescuing MPT0E028inhibited HDAC protein expression and enzyme activity.
Overexpresssing Akt neither influenced the HDAC protein
expression inhibited by MPT0E028 nor the HDAC
inhibition markers acetyl-histone 3, acetyl-α-tubulin,
or p21 induced by MPT0E028 (Fig. 4C). MPT0E028inhibited HDAC enzyme activity was similarly unaffected
by Akt overexpression (Fig. 4D). These data indicated that
MPT0E028 does not reduce HDAC enzyme activity or
protein expression through Akt inhibition. Based on these
results, it appears that MPT0E028 targets both HDACs
and Akt independently.

pathway

In addition to HDAC inhibition, MPT0E028
also possesses a potent, direct Akt targeting ability in a
concentration-dependent manner according to the Kinome
Diversity Screen Data Report from Ricerca Pharma
Services (Taiwan Pharmacol. Lab.) using the enzymebased ELISA quantitation method (IC50 = 5.78 µM) (Fig.
3A). Western blot analysis revealed that MPT0E028
caused a reduction of p-Akt (T308) in Ramos and
p-Akt (S473) in BJAB cells, as well as the downstream
protein deactivation of p-mTOR and p-GSK3β in a timedependent manner (Fig. 3B). Total Akt and downstream
proteins expressions were also downregulated by
MPT0E028 in Ramos cells (Fig. 3B, left panel), whereas
these remained unchanged in BJAB cells (Fig. 3B, right
panel), suggesting a different modulation of MPT0E028
in different cells. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, was used
as a positive control to check the basal expression of Akt
in both cells. As shown in supplementary Fig. 1, p-Akt
(S473) and p-Akt (T308) dephoshporylation could only be
detected in BJAB cells and in Ramos cells, respectively,
indicating that Akt phosphorylation is different among cell

MPT0E028 affects many genes and protein
expressions

many pathways. We also performed RT-PCR and western
blotting of these genes for mRNA (Fig. 5A) and protein
(Fig. 5B) detection. However, analysis of these genes
altered in expression revealed cell-line-specific response
to MPT0E028. In these genes of interest, we found that
STAT6, TP53, and MYC are inhibited consistently at gene,
mRNA, and protein expression in both cell lines (Table.
1) (Fig. 5A and 5B). Evidence has shown that some
HDACs correlate with STAT6 [18], p53 [19], and c-myc
[20]. However, our data show that inhibition of STAT6
and c-myc expression by MPT0E028 may not be mediated
by HDACs (HDAC1, 4, and 6) inhibition in B-cell
lymphoma cell lines (Fig. 5C). Other genes, however,
revealed inconsistent expression of mRNA and protein
levels, indicating that complicated regulations may exist
at transcriptional and translational levels in the presence
of MPT0E028.

Because HDAC inhibitors affect many gene
expressions at the transcriptional level, we determined
which genes were up- or downregulated by MPT0E028.
We extracted RNA from MPT0E028-treated Ramos
and BJAB cells and submitted to Phalanx Biotech
(Hsinchu, Taiwan). Standard selection criteria to identify
differentially expressed genes are established at |Fold
change| ≥ 1 and P < 0.05. According to the report,
around 2,000 genes are upregulated and 1,600 genes
downregulated under treatment of MPT0E028. Results
showed that MPT0E028 may affect the entire STAT family
(STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6)
as well as some oncoproteins such as MYC, TP53, and
BID (Table. 1), which are key regulators participating in

divided into five groups receiving the following daily
treatment, also by oral gavage: (a) vehicle, (b) MPT0E028
50 mg/kg, (c) MPT0E028 100 mg/kg, (d) MPT0E028 200

similar to the 100 mg/kg MPT0E028-treated group (17.9%
and 20.8% of TGI, respectively), representing more potent
tumor reduction than MPT0E028. We also observed no
significant difference in body weight between these
groups, indicating that MPT0E028 exhibits little apparent

survival. On the other hand, HDAC inhibitors may cause
non-histone substrates acetylation, which have been
implicated in the anticancer activity of HDAC inhibitors
[22, 23]. Many HDAC inhibitors are in clinical trials
and have become promising agents in recent years. We
previously demonstrated that MPT0E028, a novel HDAC
inhibitor, exhibited potent anticancer ability toward
various cell lines, including hematological malignances
and solid tumors. This revealed a forceful apoptosisinducing and HDAC inhibitory effect on colorectal
carcinoma in vitro and in vivo [12]. Since current HDAC
inhibitors are more effective against certain hematological
malignancies such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)
[24], but not B-cell lymphoma, we further investigated
the antitumor effect and detail mechanisms of MPT0E028
in B-cell lymphomas in vitro and in vivo. Our results
demonstrate that MPT0E028 targeted both Akt and
HDACs while inducing B-cell lymphoma cell apoptosis,
suggesting MPT0E028 as a novel antitumor agent with
dual functionality.
Combining HDAC inhibitors and PI3K/Akt
pathway inhibition has been shown to further induce
apoptosis in human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [25].
For example, combining HDAC inhibitors and LY294002
(a PI3K inhibitor) sensitizes a non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) xenograft to apoptosis [26]; in prostate cancer,
HDAC inhibitor produces greater antitumor activity

mice were sacrificed, and tumors were carefully removed
for western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6D, caspase
3 and PARP were activated in MPT0E028-treated and
SAHA-treated groups, with MPT0E028 inducing a
more profound effect. The acetylation levels of histone
3 and -tubulin were also increased in MPT0E028- and
SAHA-treated groups, and MPT0E028-inhibited Akt
phosphorylation was also detected. As our data showed,
the effect of MPT0E028 in vivo is consistent with that in
vitro. Taken together, the antitumor activity of MPT0E028
against human B-cell lymphoma tumor, as demonstrated
by both engrafment and xenograft, was superior to that
of SAHA, proving MPT0E028’s potent antitumor effect
in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Epigenetic dysregulation occurs in many malignant
cells, possibly due to histone modification leading to
chromatin remodeling and abnormal gene expression.
Histones can be modified in many different ways,
including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation,
sumoylation and ubiquitination [21]. Modifying
epigenetic changes is a recognized therapeutic strategy,
and histone acetylation is one of these approaches. HDAC
inhibitors relax the condensed chromatins, allowing the
re-expression of genes that control cell proliferation and

when combines with PI3K/mTOR inhibitor [27]. Coadministration of HDAC inhibitors with perifosine (an
Akt inhibitor) and rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) in
human leukemia cells also promotes mitochondria injury
and apoptosis [28, 29]. Because MPT0E028 targets both
HDACs and the Akt pathway, the benefit of omission
from combination treatment and efficacious outcomes are
predictable. Combination treatment with HDAC inhibitors
plus PI3K/Akt pathway inhibition also potentiates the
targeting effect of tumor angiogenesis [30], invasion, and
migration [31], indicating MPT0E028’s wide-ranging
usefulness. However, detailed function and mechanisms
need to be further investigated.
Many studies have demonstrated that HDAC
inhibitors also influence Akt phosphorylation [32, 33],
but few studies have identified the relationship between
HDAC and Akt under the effect of a HDAC inhibitor.

Evidence show that HDAC inhibitors, such as valproic
acid and butyrate, impede Akt1 and Akt2 expression,
which leads to Akt deactivation and apoptotic cell
death [16]. In another study, Chen et al. demonstrated
that HDAC inhibitors cause Akt dephosphorylation
by disrupting HDAC-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)
complexes, with HDAC1 and 6 contributing to this
effect much more [17]. Consistent with our data, we
show that overexpression of HDAC1potentiates the
Akt-phopshorylation level at the baseline (Fig. 4B), and
the MPT0E028-inhibited Akt phosphorylation could be
partially rescued when HDAC1 and 6 were overexpressed.
However, in this study, the Akt downstream protein
activation (e.g., p-mTOR, p-GSK3β, p-p70S6K and
p-eIF4E) inhibited by MPT0E028 apparently could not
be rescued when HDACs were overexpressed, suggesting
that function was not fully recovered under the inhibition

effect of MPT0E028 (Fig. 4B). Besides, overexpressing
Akt did not affect HDAC expression (Fig. 4C) or enzyme
activity (Fig. 4D), demonstrating that MPT0E028 inhibits
HDAC activity parallel to Akt deactivation. In Ramos
cells, total Akt protein expression was depleted under the
effect of MPT0E028 (Fig. 3B, left panel). One possible
mechanism may involve transcription inhibition [16],
another possible explanation may relate to Hsp90 and
proteasome degradation. Evidence has shown that HDAC6
directly regulates Hsp90 acetylation, and Akt is a client
protein of Hsp90; therefore, inhibition of HDAC6 may
disrupt the chaperone function of Hsp90, leading to Akt
depletion [34, 35]. We also performed microarray analysis
in Ramos cells and observed that Akt1 was downregulated
(Log2 ratio = -1.082, ***P value < 0.001) under treatment
of MPT0E028 (data not shown), suggesting MPT0E028
may influence Akt protein expression through transcription
inhibition. Thus, MPT0E028 may inhibit Akt activation
through different mechanisms due to characteristics of
different cell types.
The values of IC50 obtained from our enzyme-based
HDAC activity assay [12] were around 100 times lower
than that obtained from our cell-based assay (Fig. 2A).
This phenomenon may be explained by the existence of a
much more complicated environment in whole cells that
prevents MPT0E028 from achieving its targets. However,
enzyme-based (Fig. 3A) and cell-based Akt activity assay
(Fig. 3C) show controversially similar values of IC50,
both around 5 µM, illustrating other indirect mechanisms
may exist that facilitate the Akt-deactivation effect
of MPT0E028. Chen et al. demonstrated that HDAC
inhibitors cause Akt dephosphorylation by disrupting
HDAC-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complexes [17],
thereby releasing PP1 to deactivate Akt. MPT0E028
treatment in whole cells may not only target Akt directly
but also inhibit phosphorylation through HDAC inhibition
indirectly, therefore facilitating MPT0E028-inhibited Akt
phosphorylation.
Since HDAC inhibitors modify histone acetylation,
many genes may turn up or down due to epigenetic
modulation under treatment [36, 37]. Microarray analysis
showed that MPT0E028 may influence many genes,
including the STATs family and some oncoproteins, in
B-cell lymphoma cells (Table. 1). We found that STAT6,
p53, and c-myc are consistent in gene, mRNA, and protein
expression in both cells (Fig. 5A and 5B). STAT6 has been
found to be constitutively active in some leukemia and
lymphoma types, associated with cell proliferation and
transformation [38]. SAHA may inhibit STAT6 mRNA
and protein expression therefore decrease cell proliferation
[38]. In our study, STAT6 was profoundly inhibited at
transcriptional and translational levels under treatment
of MPT0E028 (Fig. 5A and 5B). However, we found
that HDAC1, 4, and 6 contributed little to MPT0E028inhibited STAT6 expression (Fig. 5C), indicating that
MPT0E028 may regulate STAT6 expression in a HDACswww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

independent manner. HDAC inhibitors that cause mutant
p53 degradation by either restoring or mimicking
p53 trans-functions [39] or through HDAC6-Hsp90
chaperone axis have been reported [40]. Because Ramos
(p53mutant 1254D) and BJAB (p53mutant H193R) cells both
harbor mutant p53, MPT0E028-caused p53 degradation
may be expected. However, p53 mRNA could also be
inhibited by MPT0E028 through unknown mechanisms
(Fig. 5A). MYC, one of the major oncogenes in B-cell
lymphoma [41], has also been affected by MPT0E028
(Fig. 5A and 5B). Evidence shows that HDAC-mediated
deacetylation alters the transcriptional activity of nuclear
transcription factors such as c-myc [42]. In our study,
we found that HDAC1, 4, and 6 are barely evident in
MPT0E028-inhibited c-myc expression (Fig. 5C). Recent
findings show that HDAC3 may cooperate with c-myc to
regulate microRNA expression and therefore malignant
transformation in aggressive B-cell malignancies [20].
MPT0E028 may probably inhibit these cellular proteins
through unknown mechanisms that need to be further
elucidated. However, MPT0E028 at concentrations
causing apoptosis decreases the expression of STAT6 and
c-myc. Thus, downregulation of STAT6 and c-myc may
play a part in MPT0E028-induced apoptosis in B-cell
lymphoma.
Clinical trials using HDAC inhibitors alone have
shown limited efficacy against solid tumors. Therefore,
combinations with classical chemotherapeutic agents
[43, 44] or new small molecule inhibitors [45] are being
investigated. According to our previous study, MPT0E028
also showed synergism in combination with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib and sorafenib, in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver cancer,
respectively [13, 14]. Therefore, combination treatment
with different therapeutic agents in solid tumors may
broaden the potential usage of MPT0E028. In the
case of B-cell lymphoma, HDAC inhibitor has shown
synergistic effect with anti-CD20 antibody rituximab
[46]. However, emerging evidence has demonstrated that
rationale should be followed to combine HDAC inhibitors
with immunotherapy to obtain synergistic effect due to
complexity of HDAC inhibitors on immune system and
tumor microenvironment [47]. Although MPT0E028
shows significant antitumor effect in B-cell lymphoma,
detailed mechanisms still need to be further investigated.
In conclusion, our data suggest that MPT0E028 is
a promising and effective anti-cancer HDAC inhibitor.
We demonstrated that MPT0E028 exhibits a potent dual
function of HDAC and Akt inhibition, leading to B-cell
lymphoma apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Its antitumor
activities include inducing apoptosis, HDAC activity
inhibition, Akt pathway deactivation, and regulation of
many genes in vitro; and prolongation of survival rate and
reduction of tumor volume in vivo. Our previous work
[12-14] and current studies suggest that MPT0E028 has
greater efficacy in vivo and in vitro compared to SAHA.

This study was supported by Grant from the National
Science Council of Taiwan (NSC 102-2320-B-002-036MY2 and MOST 103-2320-B-038 -020 -MY3).

Male NOD/SCID mice and nude mice (NTUH
Animal Facility) were 5 weeks old and had a body weight
(BW) range of 20-24 g on day one of the study. The mice
were carefully maintained and all animal procedures were
in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee procedures and guidelines. All animal
experiments followed ethical standards, and protocols
has been reviewed and approved by Animal Use and
Management Committee of National Taiwan University
(IACUC Approval No: 20100225).
In Ramos engrafment model, human B-cell
lymphoma Ramos cells were resuspended at 107 cells/
ml in culture medium at room temperature, and 2×106
cells were inoculated into male NOD/SCID mice via
tail vein. Treatment began 1 week after engrafment.
Both MPT0E028 and SAHA were dissolved in vehicle
(0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose + 0.1 % Tween 80 in 5%
dextrose). After engrafment, mice were randomly placed
into three groups and received the following treatment
by oral gavage during the study: (a) vehicle alone, (b)
MPT0E028 at 100 mg/kg daily, and (c) SAHA at 200 mg/
kg daily. Survival rate was used as end point for this study.
In BJAB xenograft model, the male nude mice
were injected subcutaneously with the same volume of
BD Matrigel Matrix HC (BD bioscience, catalog 354248)
and BJAB cells (2×107 cell/mouse) into the flank of
each animal. When the tumors had grown to the size of
around 80 to 100 mm3, the animals were divided into
five groups (n=7) and receive the following treatment
by oral gavage for 31 days during the study: (a) vehicle
alone, (b) MPT0E028 at 50 mg/kg daily, (c) MPT0E028
at 100 mg/kg daily, (d) MPT0E028 at 200 mg/kg daily,
and (e) SAHA at 200 mg/kg daily. Both MPT0E028 and
SAHA were dissolved in vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl
