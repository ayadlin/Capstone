ABSTRACT
Wogonin, a flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been
demonstrated to be highly effective in treating hematologic malignancies. In this
study, we investigated the anticancer effects of wogonin on K562 cells, K562
imatinib-resistant cells, and primary patient-derived CML cells. Wogonin up-regulated
transcription factor GATA-1 and enhanced binding between GATA-1 and FOG-1,
thereby increasing expression of erythroid-differentiation genes. Wogonin also upregulated the expression of p21 and induced cell cycle arrest. Studies employing
benzidine staining and analyses of cell surface markers glycophorin A (GPA) and CD71
indicated that wogonin promoted differentiation of K562, imatinib-resistant K562, and
primary patient-derived CML cells. Wogonin also enhanced binding between GATA-1
and MEK, resulting in inhibition of the growth of CML cells. Additionally, in vivo studies
showed that wogonin decreased the number of CML cells and prolonged survival of
NOD/SCID mice injected with K562 and imatinib-resistant K562 cells. These data
suggested that wogonin induces cycle arrest and erythroid differentiation in vitro
and inhibits proliferation in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

enter an accelerated phase (AP), followed by a blast
crisis (BC) during which hematopoietic differentiation
becomes arrested[4]. BCR-ABL is a fusion oncogene
which encodes tyrosine kinase that is important for the
activation of the proliferation and survival pathway[4, 5].
BCR-ABL has been verified to be the causative agent of
CML. It is generated by the t(9;22)(q34;q11). Imatinib
is a BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor which blocks the growth
of BCR-ABL-transformed cells, and is effective in
disease remission in chronic phase CML patients [6-8].
However, resistance to imatinib develops that ultimately
leads to disease progression[9]. Recently, results from
the ‘non-randomized stop IM’ trial showed that 61% of

The K562 cells were derived from a patient suffering
from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blast crisis
phase and used as the cell line for the research of erythroid
differentiation[1, 2]. Erythroid differentiation is a process
of formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow is a
highly regulated event. The erythrocytes are formed
from progenitor cells which is potent to differentiate
into erythroid or megakaryocyte lineages. CML is a
comprehensive investigation disease. It is a paradigm
for neoplasias that evolve through a muti-step process.

CML patients who discontinued imatinib after achieving
a complete molecular remission eventually relapsed [1012]. Therefore, a great deal of attention has been paid
to develop alternative molecular-based strategies for
treatment of imatinib-resistant CML.
GATA-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that
induces the differentiation of megakaryocytes and
erythrocytes, and is required for mast cell and eosinophil
development[13, 14]. Recent studies have found that
GATA-1 directly represses transcription of numerous
genes (including GATA-2 and c-Kit), and inhibits cell
division during terminal hematopoietic differentiation
[15, 16]. It is reported that GATA-1 plays critical roles
for granulocyte/monocyte (GM) and megakaryocyte/
erythrocyte (MegE) lineage commitment. GATA-1 is
critical for the development of megakaryocytes and
erythroid cells[17-19]. In addition to GATA-1, Friend
of GATA-1 (FOG-1), is also required for differentiation
of megakaryocytes and erythrocytes, where GATA-1
is expressed, and collaborates with GATA-1 to induce
erythroid differentiation [14, 17, 20]. Regulation of
GATA-1 chromatin occupancy is critical for its control of
hematopoietic lineage specification by FOG-1[14].
Wogonin is a natural flavonoid derived from a
Chinese herb, Scutellaria baicalensis, and has been
reported to induce differentiation of AML cells [21,
22]. The ability to induce cell differentiation may be
an important attribute for an anti-leukemia agent, and
we therefore further explored the effects of wogonin on
induction of differentiation in CML cells. We investigated
the effect of inducing differentiation, cycle arrest and
growth inhibition of wogonin on K562, K562 imatinibresistant cells (K562r), and primary patient-derived CML
cells in vitro. Also we detected the anti-CML effect of
wogonin in vivo. To further investigate the mechanism
of wogonin in anti-CML effect, we studied the effect of
wogonin on GATA-1. Our results about GATA-1 were
consistent with those in previous reports, and it was
possible that wogonin induced differentiation, arrested
cell cycle and inhibited growth of CML cells by regulating
GATA-1. Our data suggest that wogonin may be useful for
clinical treatment of CML patients.

staining (Figure 1G). To further confirm the effect of
wogonin on K562 cell differentiation, we examined the
expression of GPA and CD71, two erythroid differentiation
specific markers. As shown in Figure 1D and 1E, results
showed that the numbers of GPA and CD71 positive
cells increased following incubation with wogonin for
96 hours. And the mRNA level of GPA increased (Figure
1H). Additionally, the mRNA level of γ-globin increased,
one erythroid differentiation relative gene, in the cells
following incubation of wogonin for 96 hours. The dosedependent increase of γ-globin further demonstrated the
differentiation inducing activity of wogonin in K562 cells
(Figure 1I). These results indicated that wogonin induced
differentiation and arresting cell cycle at G0/G1 phase in
K562 cells.
Interestingly, we found the similar effect in imatinibresistant K562 (K562r) cells. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec,
STI571), a first generation oral BCR-ABL kinase
inhibitor, blocks the growth of BCR-ABL -transformed
cells, and is highly effective in inducing disease remission
in chronic phase CML patients (remission rate > 90%)
[23, 24]. Unfortunately, the pre-existence of imatinib
mesylate resistance ultimately leads to therapy failure[6,
8]. Wogonin exerted its anticancer effects via a different
mechanism from imatinib, suggesting the possible
sensitivity of K562r cells. Wogonin arrested cell cycle at
G0/G1 phase in K562r cells (Figure 1A, 1C). Benzidine
staining, specific markers detection of GPA and CD71 and
mRNA expression of GPA and γ-globin results showed
the differentiation inducing activity of wogonin (Figure
1D, 1F-I). These results showed that wogonin induced
erythroid differentiation and arrest cell cycle in both K562
and K562r cells.

Effects of wogonin on GATA-1 regulation in K562
and K562r cells
To further examine the mechenism of wogonin
on K562 and K562r cells, we detected nuclear proteins
expression in these two cell lines in the presence of
wogonin for 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours. Western blot
analyses showed that levels of nuclear GATA-1 and FOG1 were increased in a dose-dependent manner following
incubation with wogonin (Figure 2A). Moreover, cells
treated with 20, 40, and 80 µM wogonin for 48 hours
showed a dose-dependent increase in DNA binding of
GATA-1 (Figure 2B). It has been reported that FOG1 and GATA-1 are coexpressed during embryonic and
hematopoietic development[25, 26]. GATA-1 binds to
FOG-1 and synergistically activates transcription from
a hematopoietic-specific regulatory region[25-28]. We
therefore detected the binding ability between GATA1 and FOG-1 following incubating with wogonin for
48 hours (Figure 2C). The immunoprecipitation (IP)
assay showed that wogonin enhanced the binding ability

G0/G1 phase in K562 cells (Figure 1A-B). A 4-day

between GATA-1 and FOG-1, which was confirmed by
real-time PCR analysis of α-globin, c-kit and GATA-2, the
genes regulated by GATA-1 (Figure 2D). Therefore, it is
concluded that wogonin induced erythroid differentiation
by increasing expression of GATA-1 and FOG-1 and
modulating DNA transcription via up-regulation of the
binding of FOG-1 to GATA-1.

It is reported that GATA-1 binds to the promoter of
p21 and activates its transcription[29-32]. To investigate
the molecular mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by
wogonin, we examined the levels of the key checkpoints

of cell cycle progression in K562 and K562r cells. The
ChIP experiment showed that the binding ability between
GATA-1 and the promoter of p21 in both K562 and
K562r cells enhanced when treated wogonin for 48 hours
(Supplement figure 1). Also, cells treated with wogonin
showed up-regulation of p21 (Figure 2E). Furthermore,
wogonin treatment down-regulated cyclin-dependent
kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin D1 (Figure 2E). These results
showed that wogonin arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase

in K562 and K562r group (Figure 3B-C). Wogonin also
extended the survival of CML-bearing mice compared
with mice in the control group (Figure 3A). The median
survival time of mice injected with K562 and K562r cells
were 27.8±2.91 and 19.5±2.7 days in the control groups
and were 45±13.1 and 34.3±13.1 days in the wogonintreated groups. These results demonstrated that wogonin
suppresses proliferation of K562 and K562r cells in vivo.

Antiproliferative effects of wogonin in vivo

Primary leukemic cells from CML patients were
collected and used to investigate the effects of wogonin
in CML cells. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, expression
of CD71 and GPA in CML cells increased following
treatment with wogonin for 96 hours (Figure 4A-B).
These data showed that wogonin induced differentiation
in primary CML cells. The western blot results showed
that the expression of GATA-1 increased in wogonintreated primary CML cells (Figure 4D). However, results

We next examined the effects of wogonin in vivo.
15 days after injection with K562 and K562r cells, blood
samples from three mice randomly in each group were
examined for CD13 expression, a surface marker of K562
cells. The results showed that mice inoculated K562 and
K562r cells expressed more CD13 than normal mice and
wogonin significantly decreased the expression of CD13

primary CML cells. We speculated that GATA-1 may
inhibit cell proliferation through a non-transactivation
mechanism. It is known that continued activation of the
Philadelphia chromosome causes phosphorylation of
downstream proteins such as MEK and ERK, resulting
in activation of cell proliferation pathways[33, 34]. In
addition, it has been reported that GATA-1 inhibits the
MEK pathway by binding with MEK[35]. Therefore,
we speculated that wogonin affects the binding ability
between GATA-1 and MEK. Following treatment with
wogonin for 36 hours, IP results showed that wogonin
enhanced the binding ability between GATA-1 and MEK in

K562 and K562r cells (Figure 4E), and then we examined
the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in these two cell
lines. The results showed that levels of phosphorylated
MEK and ERK decreased following incubation with
wogonin (Figure 4F). The primary CML cells treated with
wogonin for 48 hours also showed notable reduction of

phosphorylated MEK and ERK (Figure 4D). These results
suggested that, apart from increasing expression of p21
and promoting DNA binding, wogonin increased protein
expression of MEK and ERK by enhancing the binding
ability between GATA-1 and MEK.

GATA-1 siRNA partially reduced wogonin-induced cell
proliferation inhibition (Figure 5B). After silencing GATA1 (Figure 5A), wogonin-induced expression of CD71 and
GPA in K562 and K562r cells decreased (Figure 5C-D).
In the same way, with the GATA-1 silence, the effect of
wogonin on cell cycle arrest was also inhibited (Figure
6A-B). Meanwhile, the regulative effect of wogonin on the
levels of cell cycle regulators were also reduced (Figure
6C). These data suggested that GATA-1 is required for
wogonin-induced cell differentiation and cell cycle arrest.

To better understand the role of GATA-1 in
wogonin-induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest,
we transfected the siRNA of GATA-1 into K562 and
K562r cells and monitored efficacy of transfection using
western blot assays. Results of MTT assay showed that

DISCUSSION

GATA-1. Wogonin increased the binding ability of MEK
and GATA-1, inhibiting the activation of the MEK-ERK
pathway[35]. GATA-1 inhibits phosphorylation of ERK
by interacting with MEK, which is upstream of ERK, and
the phosphorylation of ERK inhibits cell proliferation[35].
It has been reported that MEK contains a nuclear export
signal in its N-terminal domain, indicating that MEK
works in the nucleus for signaling purposes, and then
returns to the cytoplasm. GATA-1 binds with MEK in the
nucleus and inhibits its activity[43]. Wogonin increased
the binding ability between GATA-1 and MEK, and then
inhibited phosphorylation of MEK. Therefore, we knew
that, GATA-1 is the key factor in wogonin’s effect on
K562 cells.
We further examined the effect of GATA-1 on
primary CML cells. Our studies showed that levels of
phosphorylated MEK and ERK in primary CML cells
were higher than those in K562 cells, and wogonin
showed a more inhibitory effect on phosphorylation of
MEK and ERK in primary CML cells (Data not shown).
This difference might be due to the fact that the primary
cells used in the current study were blast crisis cells.
Although K562 is a blast crisis cell line, the primary cells
may show a stronger ability in proliferation. Therefore,
primary cells have aberrant copy numbers of BCR-ABL,
which is likely to provide stronger survival signaling[10].
Finally, wogonin did not affect DNA binding in primary
CML cells, which was totally different from the activity in
K562 cells, suggesting that GATA-1 plays a different role
under different cellular environments.
Depart from K562 cells we also focused on the
effect of wogonin on K562r cells. Drug-resistance
presents a significant problem when using imatinib for
the treatment of CML patients. The resistance of CML
to imatinib treatment mostly manifests as decreased drug
uptake and mutation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene[5].
Although the second generation TKIs, such as nilotinib
and dasatinib, appear to be effective in imatinib-resistant
patients, these drugs are also TKIs, it is possible for these
drugs appear the similar resistance with imatinib, and
therefore new treatment strategies are needed urgently[5,
9, 44]. Recently, results from the ‘non-randomized
stop IM’ trial showed that 61% of CML patients who
discontinued imatinib after achieving a complete
molecular remission eventually relapsed[10, 11]. For
example, the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin selectively
sensitizes Bcr-Abl-expressing leukemia cells[12]. The
mechanism by which wogonin inhibits proliferation
of CML cells is totally different from that of imatinib,
which offers a possibility that wogonin may be effective
in imatinib-resistant CML. Our in vivo and in vitro data
showed that wogonin induced differentiation and cell
cycle arrest in K562r cells, inhibited cell proliferation, and
extended lifespan of K562r-bearing mice. These findings
strongly suggested that wogonin may be an alternative
drug for treatment avoiding the drug-resistance problem

Treatment of leukemia by forcing malignant cells
to undergo differentiation instead of being killed by
cytotoxic drugs is a promising alternative therapeutic
strategy for leukemia, which has been previously applied
for treatment of AML[36, 37]. In this study, we found
an interesting phenomenon that wogonin could induce
erythroid differentiation in K562 cells and primary CML
cells, demonstrated by the benzidine staining assay and
increased level of CD71 and GPA.
GATA-1 is a transcription factor that regulates
cellular differentiation and proliferation[38, 39]. It
is initially discovered as a nuclear protein that binds
numerous GATA consensus motifs distributed throughout
various enhancers and promoters of erythroid-specific
genes[38]. Moreover, GATA-1 is also a key regulator
of erythropoiesis, and inhibition of GATA-1 decrease
the erythropoietic effect of EPO[40]. The essential
GATA-1 cofactor FOG-1 is required for differentiation
of erythrocytes, and recent studies have shown that
FOG-1 promotes GATA-1 transcription activity not
only by recruiting coactivators, but also by directly
modulating chromatin occupancy[38, 41]. Our results
demonstrated that wogonin enhances DNA binding of
GATA-1 and recruits FOG-1, resulting in increased
expression of erythroid-specific genes, leading to
erythroid differentiation. The results of siRNA confirmed
that GATA-1 has an important role in wogonin-induced
erythroid differentiation. GATA-1 is the key factor
involved in wogonin-induced differentiation. There
are many factors that affect the expression of GATA-1
including the GATA-1/GATA-2 switch effect[41]. Other
signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, may
regulate the phosphorylation and subsequent activity of
GATA-1. It is previously reported that wogonin has the
ability to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway[42]. Further
studies are required to study whether wogonin regulates
erythroid differentiation through other signaling pathways.
Cell cycle arrest is an essential early event in
inducing differentiation. Therefore, we detected the cell
cycle arrest effect of wogonin on K562 cells. Also, we
focused on the effect of GATA-1 in cell cycle arrest.
Previous research showed that GATA-1 binds to the
promoter of p21 and activates the expression of p21 and its
downstream proteins[29]. Our data showed that wogonin
arrested the cell cycle following 48 hours treatment by
enhancing the binding ability between GATA-1 and the
promoter of p21 and then promoted the expression of p21.
We had demonstrated that wogonin induced
erythroid differentiation and cycle arrest and found that
wogonin had these effects via regulating the function of
GATA-1. In vivo results showed that wogonin prolonged
the survival of mice injected with CML cells by inhibiting
proliferation of K562 cells. Our investigation indicated
that wogonin inhibited proliferation of K562 cells via

associated with TKIs.
In conclusion, our study showed that wogonin
induced erythroid differentiation and cell cycle arrest
in CML cells via regulating the function of GATA1. Wogonin increased the expression of GATA-1 then
activated transcription and promoted the expression of
p21 and enhanced the binding ability between GATA-1
and MEK. Additionally, wogonin significantly prolonged
survival of CML-bearing mice by inhibiting proliferation
of K562 and K562r cells. These data suggested that
wogonin is a potent drug for treatment of CML. Moreover,
because its mechanisms of action differ from those of
TKIs, wogonin may provide an alternative for TKIresistance CML. In this study, we found that the dosage is
high both in vivo and in vitro, we think that wogonin may
become an assist drug for CML and combine with TKIs.

leukemic cells and K562/K562r cell lines were cultured
with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animal model

Cell cycle analysis
The cell cycle analysis was employed by propidium
iodide staining and quantified by a FACS Calibur flow
cytometer (Becton, Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA)[46].
The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was
analyzed with Modfit software (Becton, Dickinson, San
Jose, CA, USA).

Animal studies were conducted in accordance
with the regulations of the China Food and Drug
Administration (CFDA) on Animal Care. Female NOD/
SCID immunodeficient mice (aged 6–9 weeks) were
purchased from Beijing HFK bioscience Company
Limited. The mice were maintained in an air-conditioned
pathogen-free room under conditions of controlled lighting
(12 h light/day) and fed a standard diet of laboratory food
and water. These immunodeficient mice were sublethally
irradiated (2.4 Gy), and were injected with K562, K562r,
or primary CML cells via the tail vein (2–5 × 106 cells
per mouse, n = 6 per group) in 24 hours following the
radiation treatment. Animals in the control group were
injected with Physiological saline to evaluate the effects
of injection on survival. The next day, the mice were
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with or without wogonin
(80 mg/kg) every other day for 14 days[42]. Following
i.p. injection, the animals in K562 and K562r groups were
inspected daily for 80 days, the animals in primary CML
group were inspected daily for 30 days, and survival was
represented using a Kaplan-Meier survival plot.

Reagents and antibodies
Wogonin (purity ≥99%) was synthesized and used
in all experiments unless otherwise indicated[45]. The
final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in all
experiments was ≤0.01%, and cells treated with the highest
concentration of DMSO were used as controls in the
corresponding experiments. Heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS), and RPMI 1640 medium were purchased
from Gibco Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
PE anti-human CD71 (Transferrin Receptor), APC antihuman Glycophorin A (CD235a) and FITC anti-human
CD13 antibodies were purchased from eBioscience (San
Diego, CA, USA). Antibodies against GATA-1, FOG1, MEK, ERK, p-ERK (Thr 177/160), and β-actin were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA), and antibodies against p-MEK (Ser 217/221)
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, USA). IRDyeTM 800-conjugated secondary
antibodies were obtained from Rockland (Philadelphia,

Cell proliferation assays in vivo

Cell culture

In vivo investigations were performed using
immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice engrafted with,
K562, K562r, or primary human CML cells. Twenty days
later, blood of the NOD/SCID mice was collected and the
expression of CD13, a marker of K562, was examined
by flow cytometry with a FACS Calibur flow cytometer
(Becton, Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).

The K562 cell line was purchased from the cell bank
of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology.
Imatinib-resistant K562 cells were kindly provided by
Professor Junia V. Melo, Department of Pathophysiology,
Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities
E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and
Apoptosis of the National Ministry of Education. Primary
leukemic cells from CML blast crisis patients (Zhongda
Hospital of Southeast University, Nanjing, China) were
collected using lymphocyte-monocyte separation medium
(Jingmei, Nanjing, China). The protocol of collection

Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

plates for 5 days. Following incubation, the cells were
collected and washed twice with PBS, stained with
benzidine solution containing 3% H2O2 for 30 min,
followed by addition 0.6 mL of 10% ethanoic acid[47].
Cells displaying brown-blue color after staining were
regarded as erythroid differentiation positive cells. The
experiment was conducted in triplicate. Expression of the
cell surface differentiation markers GPA and CD71 was
determined by flow cytometry with a FACS Calibur flow
cytometer (Becton, Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).

The RT-PCR assay was prepared as described
previously[48]. For quantitative analysis of gene
expression, total RNA was isolated using a TRIzol kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Complementary DNA
was synthesized using a complementary DNA synthesis
kit (Code DRR047A; TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Relative quantities of
mRNA were measured using Applied Biosystems 7500
Fast Real-Time PCR System (PerkinElmer, Torrance, CA,
USA) and double-stranded DNA dye SYBR Green PCR
core reagents (Code DRR081C; TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan).
Amplification was performed with 40 cycles at 95°C for
15 seconds and then at 60°C for 30 seconds. Data were
analyzed using 7500 system SDS software.

Western blot analysis
The Western blot analysis was prepared as described
previously[48]. Cells were collected and lysed in lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1% (m/v) NP-40, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), 0.1 mM NaF, and 1.0 mM dithiothreitol).
The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g and 4 °C for
15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were
measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) by a Varioskan multimode
microplate spectrophotometer (Thermo Waltham, MA,
USA). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were separated
by 8-12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto PVDF
membranes (Millipore, Boston, MA, USA). The blots
were then incubated with primary antibodies for overnight
at 4°C, followed by incubation with IRDyeTM800
conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 37°C. Detection
was performed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (LI-COR Inc, Lincoln, NE, USA).

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the mean ± standard error
of the mean (SEM) for the values obtained from at least
three independent experiments. Statistical analysis of
multiple-group comparisons was performed by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni
posthoc test. Comparisons between two groups were
analyzed using the two-tailed Student’s t-test. The survival
of NOD/SCID mice was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier
analysis using the log-rank test to compare differences. P
value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
