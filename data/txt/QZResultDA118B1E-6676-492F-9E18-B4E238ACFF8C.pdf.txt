The importance of tumor angiogenesis in tumor biology is now widely accepted. Hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) is a highly vascular tumor, and angiogenesis is believed to play a considerable role in its development and progression. The authors reviewed the role of circulating vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) in screening for HCC and in risk stratification and treatment monitoring. They searched the world
medical literature by accessing MEDLINE and PubMed for articles on: 1) the utility of circulating VEGF for
HCC screening in patients with cirrhosis; 2) the role of circulating VEGF as a predictor of the invasive
potential of HCC; and 3) monitoring anti-HCC treatment effects by serial measurements of circulating
VEGF. They found evidence to support a potential role for VEGF in screening and surveillance of HCC. They
also found support for developing the use of VEGF in the monitoring of treatment outcomes. Several studies suggested that the circulating VEGF level may be an independent prognostic marker in HCC. Further
studies are needed to determine the utility of circulating VEGF in screening of patients with cirrhosis and
to determine its potential role as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in patients with HCC. Cancer

KEY WORDS: vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocellular carcinoma, screening, angiogenesis,
metastasis.

In recent years, much basic and clinical research has focused on defining molecular events that lead to tumor development, growth, and invasion. New blood vessel formation is essential for malignant transformation and the distant spread of cancer cells, and angiogenesis in tumors has been a recent therapeutic
target. Several clinical trials have demonstrated a benefit from targeted therapies, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted agents, when combined with cytotoxic therapy,1-7 and as single
agents.8-18 Furthermore, angiogenesis may be an important target for the secondary prevention of cancer,
and biomarkers of angiogenesis may allow hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to be diagnosed at a curable
stage. This review will therefore focus on the role of VEGF in screening, risk stratification, and treatment
monitoring in HCC. It will include a basic review of screening for HCC, VEGF in the biology of HCC,

measurement and clinical utility of circulating VEGF,
using VEGF measurements to monitor treatment, clinical
trials of antiangiogenic agents in HCC, and future
directions.
HCC is the most common primary liver malignancy,
the sixth most common cancer, and the third most common
cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.19 The incidence
of liver cancer in the United States has steadily risen over the
last 2 decades, with an estimated 21,370 new cases and
18,410 deaths from this disease in 2008.20 The rising incidence and prevalence of HCC in the United States in the
last 2 decades is mainly attributed to the increase in the
number of persons living with chronic hepatitis C virus
infection.21 Migration from endemic areas and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis also likely play a role. Cirrhosis, irrespective of its etiology, is also an important risk factor for
HCC, with patients who have cirrhosis having a 1% to 6%
annual risk of developing HCC.22 Because >80% of HCCs
originate in cirrhotic livers because of underlying chronic
liver disease, surveillance programs have been recommended
for patients with known cirrhosis to provide earlier detection of HCC, and improve the chance for cure. Available
screening methods include regular imaging of the liver and
measurement of serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) blood levels.
AFP is the most commonly used serum tumor marker for
HCC. However, elevated AFP levels also occur in patients
with noncancerous conditions of the liver. A systematic
review and critical analysis of the literature, based on a Medline search from 1966 to 2002, indicated that for HCC
screening, a serum AFP level >20 lg/L had a sensitivity of
41% to 65%, specificity of 80% to 94%, positive likelihood
ratios of 3.1 to 6.8, and negative likelihood ratios of 0.4 to
0.6 for diagnosis of HCC.23 This relatively poor performance, in addition to the unmet need for early HCC diagnosis, led us to a search for more sensitive and specific
biomarkers of HCC. Because HCC is a highly vascular tumor, researchers have studied screening patients for markers
of increased angiogenesis, which may be detected even
before HCC is clinically manifest. However, to the best of
our knowledge, most of the studies that discussed the potential role of VEGF in this setting report preliminary results,
and none has been validated in a prospective setting.
HCC is potentially curable by surgical resection and
liver transplantation. However, the majority of patients
present with advanced stage disease, which is most commonly accompanied by severe background liver disease.

Therefore, surgery is feasible for only a small fraction of
patients with localized disease. Moreover, systemic cytotoxic therapies have demonstrated a very limited impact
on the natural history of advanced HCC. In the last decade, molecular characterization of HCC has led to the recognition of defined aberrant signaling pathways, which
helped in subsequent development of targeted agents as
potential choices for the treatment of this chemoresistant
disease. Notably, antiangiogenesis therapies have shown
the most promise so far in treatment of advanced HCC.

Angiogenesis in the Biology of HCC
Angiogenesis is a cascade of linked and sequential steps that
ultimately lead to the neovascularization of tumors. Significant HCC growth is dependant on angiogenesis, and an
increase in tumor dimension beyond 0.5 mm will induce
the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells.24 VEGF, also
called vascular permeability factor, was initially identified in
1983 as a protein secreted by tumor cells.25 As a potent permeability factor, VEGF promotes extravasation of plasma
fibrinogen, leading to the formation of fibrin scaffolding
that facilitates cell migration during invasion. As an endothelial growth factor, VEGF stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, thus inducing the budding of new blood vessels
around the growing tumor masses.

Molecular Interactions With VEGF
VEGF mediates its angiogenic effects via several different
receptors (see Fig. 1). VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1 and
VEGFR2 were originally discovered on endothelial cells
as tyrosine kinase receptors. The various members of the
VEGF family have different binding affinities for each receptor. VEGFR1 plays an important role in developmental angiogenesis as well as other processes, including
monocyte migration, recruiting of endothelial cell progenitors, increasing the adhesive properties of natural
killer cells, and inducing growth factors from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.26 VEGFR2 mediates the majority of
the downstream effects of VEGF in angiogenesis, including microvascular permeability, endothelial cell proliferation, tumor cell migration, and survival.
Neuropilin-1 and -2 are transmembrane glycoproteins
that interact with several members of the VEGF family
ligands, and have been shown to serve as coreceptors for

The VEGF family comprises 6 glycoproteins; VEGFA, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E, and placental
growth factor. Within these major VEGF subtypes are multiple isoforms. The best-characterized VEGF family member is VEGF-A (commonly referred to as VEGF). The

Review Article

human VEGF-A transcript undergoes alternative splicing to
yield mature proteins of 121, 145, 165, 183, 189, and 206
amino acids; VEGF-165 is the predominant isoform.29
Notably, VEGF is coded by a single gene that contains 8
exons separated by 7 introns; exons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 are
common to all isoforms. In addition, VEGF-165 contains
exon 7, and VEGF-189 contains exons 6 and 7, which have
been shown to encode the extracellular matrix-binding domain of the VEGF. This domain is able to bind heparin sulfate proteoglycans and other matrix proteins. Therefore,
after secretion, VEGF-189 and part of VEGF-165 bind to
the extracellular matrix and cell membrane. Extracellular
enzymes, such as heparinases, plasmin, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and matrix metalloproteinase, are able
to release bound VEGF and regulate the VEGF bioavailability. Thus, circulating VEGF-165 is the most abundant
active biologic isoform involved in angiogenesis.

Significance of Tissue VEGF Levels in the
Biology of HCC
Studies have shown that VEGF is frequently expressed in
HCC. In a quantitative analysis study of 70 HCC cases,
VEGF expression as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was observed in 63.9% of encapsulated and
78.3% of nonencapsulated HCCs, and 90.9% of HCCs
with extrahepatic metastasis.30 Another study reported
VEGF-positive expression, using IHC, in 72 of 105 HCC
patients (68.6%).31 Capsular infiltration (P Â¼ .005), vascular invasion (P Â¼ .035), shorter overall survival (P Â¼
.014), and intrahepatic metastasis (P Â¼ .008) were
observed more frequently in patients with VEGF-positive
tumors. Other studies suggested a correlation between the
degree of tissue VEGF expression measured by IHC and
intensity of both the magnetic resonance signal and the
contrast enhancement of the hepatic artery on computed
tomography in patients with HCC using IHC.32-34 Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated a definite correlation between tumor VEGF expression using IHC and
microvessel density, which is a marker of tumor angiogenesis.35,36 Similar findings in other studies have laid the
groundwork for using VEGF activity as a tool to screen
for both premalignant liver lesions and invasive
HCC.37,38 In the first study,37 tissue mRNA level of
VEGF-165 was assessed by a semiquantitative reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction in 29 patients
4898

with HCC, 26 with cirrhosis, and 15 with chronic hepatitis. The liver expression of mRNA of VEGF-165 was
found to be significantly higher in HCC than in chronic
liver diseases and in the cirrhotic tissue of HCC patients
than in those with HCC-free cirrhosis. The second
study38 evaluated the relation between the expression of
VEGF and vascular density in the HCC and nonmalignant hepatic parenchyma and reported a strong correlation between the levels of VEGF expression in tissue and
the number of vessels, which was significantly higher in
the areas of HCC and internodular fibrotic tissue in cirrhotic liver than in non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma.
Moreover, the role of angiogenesis in the progression of premalignant lesions to invasive cancers prompted
investigators to study the role of VEGF in the natural history of HCC. A group of researchers suggested that tissue
VEGF expression increased according to the stepwise development of HCC.39 VEGF levels were noted to progressively increase through the successive steps of lowgrade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and early HCCs.
Numerous studies, summarized in Table 1, have
attempted to determine the impact of tissue VEGF
expression on clinicopathologic features, tumor phenotype, and prognosis. VEGF expression in HCCs with microscopic venous invasion was significantly higher than in
HCCs without invasion.30,40,41 In a study of 105 patients
undergoing potential curative resection for HCC,31
patients with VEGF-positive tumors (68.6%) more frequently had capsular infiltration, vascular and intrahepatic metastasis, and a shorter median survival than
patients with VEGF-negative tumors. Another study of
20 patients with HCC confirmed that higher VEGF
expression was associated with a lower median survival.42
Moreover, other studies have shown that expression of
VEGF in HCC was correlated with the probability of recurrence after tumor resection or ablation.43-46 Collectively,
these findings suggest that tissue VEGF expression in HCC
may indicate more advanced disease and reduced median survival. However, these studies had relatively small patient
numbers and used different VEGF detection assays.

regarding whether the serum VEGF level is indeed a true
reflection of tumor angiogenic activity. Serum VEGF can
be released from platelets during ex vivo clotting, which
does not necessarily have to be related to tumors and
therefore may not be truly representative of the tumor milieu. In a study of 60 patients with HCC, serum VEGF165 isoform levels correlated significantly with platelet
counts,47 but when the serum VEGF levels were corrected
for the individual platelet counts, the serum VEGF/platelet ratio correlated significantly with tumor cytosolic
VEGF concentration. In addition, advancing HCC stage
was associated with a significant increase in tumor cytosolic VEGF concentration, serum VEGF/platelet ratio,
and serum VEGF level. It was concluded that the serum
VEGF/platelet ratio correlated positively with tumor
VEGF expression.
Additional reports have suggested that the degree
of serum VEGF elevation correlates with tumor stage
and more aggressive behavior of HCC.30 One study
demonstrated that tumors measuring >2 cm in greatest dimension had higher median serum VEGF levels
Cancer

than those <2 cm.48 Another study of 108 patients
indicated that elevated serum VEGF levels were significantly associated with venous invasion and advanced
tumor stage. Patients with a serum VEGF level higher
than median (>245.0 pg/mL) had significantly worse
overall and disease-free survival than those with a lower
level.49 Another study confirmed the relation between
elevated serum VEGF in HCC patients and tumor size
using a cutoff point of 5 cm.50 This study also demonstrated significantly higher serum VEGF levels in
those patients with macroscopically evident portal vein
invasion and metastasis. In addition, preoperative serum VEGF levels have correlated with clinicopathological features and long-term survival,49 and appeared to
reflect the diseaseâ€™s potential for vascular invasion and
metastasis.51 In the previously mentioned studies, it
was also suggested that higher serum VEGF levels predict a poorer outcome after resection of HCC. Therefore, monitoring serum VEGF levels might not only
lead to early diagnosis of HCC, but also provide clinicians with an early indication of disease prognosis.

Review Article

The role of serum VEGF as a biomarker for HCC
screening has been investigated. In a study of 63 patients,
patients with HCC had significantly higher serum VEGF
levels (median, 245 pg/mL) than healthy volunteers (median, 180 pg/mL) (P Â¼ .042).49 Serum VEGF was also
combined with serum AFP in attempts to improve screening for HCC. A recent report of 77 individuals including
controls demonstrated that the combination of a serum
AFP value of >19.8 ng/mL and a serum VEGF value of
>355.2 pg/mL increased HCC screening sensitivity to
95.5% compared with the individual sensitivities of
68.2% and 86.4%, respectively.52 However, test for a significant difference was not provided by the authors.
Furthermore, noncancerous hepatic conditions associated with elevated serum VEGF have been found to be
associated with lower serum VEGF values than the previously mentioned cancerous conditions; serum VEGF levels (as measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent
assay [ELISA]) were 58.0 pg/mL, 44.1 pg/mL, and 172.7
pg/mL in patients with chronic hepatitis (n Â¼ 40), cirrhosis (n Â¼ 34), and acute hepatitis (n Â¼ 21), respectively.53
Thus, serum VEGF level in HCC patients has
shown promise for HCC screening whether used alone or
combined with serum AFP. However, these studies report
preliminary results, and none has been validated in a prospective setting.
Plasma VEGF

The confounding effect of a plateletâ€™s storage and
release of VEGF on the serum levels of VEGF may be
overcome by measuring the plasma levels of VEGF.
Increased plasma VEGF levels were found to be associated
with the presence of extrahepatic metastases and portal
vein involvement in 45 patients with HCC undergoing
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).43 In addition,
significant differences were noted when plasma VEGF
was categorized by tumor size, distant metastasis, and
TNM stage. In another study of 30 patients with HCC,
increased plasma VEGF expression was associated with
the development of HCC metastases after TACE.54
Another study reported that plasma VEGF was a promising predictor for distant metastases from HCC.55 The
study reported that the levels were significantly elevated in
the HCC group, compared with the control, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis groups. Furthermore, stage IV patients
with distant metastases demonstrated significantly
4900

marked elevation of plasma VEGF compared with the
patients at the other stages. Notably, several other studies
reported consistently lower degrees of VEGF elevation in
noncancerous liver conditions, with mean plasma VEGF
levels ranging from 12.1 pg/mL to 89.9 pg/mL as measured by ELISA.56-58
Serum VEGF versus plasma
VEGF measurements

Current evidence supports the use of serum VEGF
level as an indirect measure of tumor VEGF expression.47
However, serum VEGF concentrations may fluctuate
based on clotting that is related to sample processing.59
Conversely, in plasma collections, platelet degranulation
is minimized by adding anticoagulants to the blood samples. Consequently, plasma VEGF concentrations are up
to 20 lower than the matched serum VEGF concentrations.60 Moreover, plasma VEGF levels are not affected
by the amount of time between blood sampling and centrifugation.59 In light of these considerations, plasma
VEGF is likely a more reproducible and reliable estimate
of HCC VEGF activity.
VEGF protein versus mRNA detection

We made several attempts to evaluate the feasibility
of measuring of tissue and circulating mRNA levels. In 1
report, the preoperative level of circulating serum VEGF
mRNA, especially isoform VEGF-165, was predictive for
disease recurrence in a study of 50 patients with HCC.61
However, mRNA changes, overall, had surprisingly minimal correlation with changes in the coding proteins, a discrepancy that reflects post-translational modifications
that regulate protein structure, function, activation, and
degradation.62 In addition, the unbound VEGF form
remains the biologically active entity as previously mentioned. Therefore, detecting VEGF-165 by ELISA may
be the optimal method of assay.
Using VEGF Levels to Monitor
Treatment Response
Changes in VEGF levels in tissue and peripheral blood
during therapy may help establish VEGF as a biomarker
for treatment effect and improve our understanding of the
influence of antiangiogenic therapies in patients with
HCC.

VEGF in Hepatocellular Carcinoma/Kaseb et al

Most recently, a study of an anti-VEGF antibody,
bevacizumab, in advanced HCC reported preliminary
results that indicated a possible correlation between
response to therapy and plasma VEGF levels.12 Plasma
was available in 8 HCC patients, before therapy, and after
an initial 8-week treatment period. Plasma was also available at time of disease progression for 6 of these 8 patients.
Plasma VEGF levels decreased from baseline in all
patients after 8 weeks of bevacizumab therapy (baseline:
mean VEGF-A level, 746 pg/mL; 8 weeks: mean VEGFA level, 249 pg/mL [P Â¼ .003]). At the time of disease
progression, VEGF-A increased from 8-week values to
near baseline levels in 5 of 6 patients for whom plasma
was available (mean VEGF-A level at progression, 653 pg/
mL; P Â¼ .013). Although this is an interesting observation, the supporting data are preliminary and merit more
vigorous investigation before suggesting the use of VEGF
as a surrogate marker in this setting. Interestingly, 2 previous reports indicated increase in circulating total VEGF
level after antiangiogenic therapy.63,64 However, the
authors described a reduction of free serum VEGF in cancer patients treated with escalating doses of bevacizumab
when compared with basal serum concentrations in the
first study.63 The second study measured plasma VEGF
levels, before and 12 days after a single-dose infusion of
bevacizumab, and found a significant increase in the levels
of plasma VEGF; the authors commented that it will be
crucial to establish how much of the VEGF in the plasma
represents free protein (unbound to bevacizumab) at Day
12.64 Therefore, future studies should be directed toward
obtaining serial samples at more time points, including
midâ€“cycles, in addition to evaluating free and total VEGF
to shed more light on the biology of VEGF signaling in
this setting.
Furthermore, plasma VEGF levels were shown to be
increased shortly after treatment with TACE.65,66 The
peak plasma VEGF occurred anywhere from Day 1 to
Day 7 after TACE, with a slow decline thereafter. These
increased plasma VEGF levels are thought to be related to
the induction of tissue hypoxia, which leads to VEGF production via increased HIF-1 transcription. One study did
not find a significant difference between serum VEGF levels before and after radiofrequency ablation.67 This finding may have been related to the use of serum VEGF
levels, less hypoxia induced by radiofrequency ablation
than by TACE, or timing of the samples. Alternatively,
Cancer

November 1, 2009

the impact of treatment-induced hypoxia may be limited
to the tissue VEGF levels, which would not be detected in
the blood. Higher tissue levels of VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor were also found in resected HCC
specimens from patients who received preresection TACE
than in specimens from patients who did not receive preresection TACE.68 Another study demonstrated that the
microvessel density significantly increased after TACE in
patients with HCC.69 Collectively, these findings suggest
that the short-term treatment-induced increase of plasma
VEGF reflected the up-regulated tissue VEGF levels and
new blood vessel formation in the remaining viable tumor
and/or normal hepatic parenchyma.
Studies also explored the prognostic value of plasma
VEGF levels after TACE. Risk of disease progression has
been shown to increase in patients whose plasma VEGF
levels after TACE were increased above baseline.54 In a 6month follow-up of 30 patients after TACE, all 22
patients who had progression had elevated plasma VEGF
levels after TACE, whereas none of the patients with
decreased plasma VEGF levels after TACE exhibited progressive disease. Similar findings were reported in a recent
study of patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation.70 The rise in VEGF levels after local therapy for
patients with HCC indicates a potential for biomarkerguided antiangiogenic therapy in this setting. Furthermore, circulating VEGF levels may be predictive of the
outcomes after local therapies or a biomarker-guided adjunctive antiangiogenic approach. However, serial measurements of circulating VEGF before and after local
therapies in future clinical trials are warranted to further
evaluate changes in angiogenesis pathway in this setting.

Clinical Trials of Antiangiogenic Agents in
Patients With HCC
Several targeted agents have recently been tested in
patients with advanced HCC, including agents targeting
the VEGF pathway, either alone8-18,71,72 or in combination with other systemic therapies (Table 2).1,7,73-78
The cancer cell has been the only target of anticancer
therapy for more than 50 years. However, the cancer cell
is genetically unstable, and mutations accumulate. Conversely, antiangiogenic therapy targets endothelial cells
that are genetically stable. Thalidomideâ€™s mechanism of
action was believed to be partly based on its

effect by targeting VEGFR-2/-3. Most recently, 2 phase 3
trials of sorafenib were reported.8,18 The pivotal randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of sorafenib in
patients with advanced HCC, the SHARP trial, reported
a 2.8-month improvement in median overall survival rate
(P Â¼ .0006), along with increased time to disease progression and disease control rate, and a 2.3% response rate.8
This has led to the US Food and Drug Administration approval of sorafenib for advanced HCC. Bevacizumab is a
recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF and may augment chemotherapy administration by making tumor vasculature less permeable and
decreasing the elevated tumor interstitial pressure. Erlotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks phosphorylation at the intracellular domain of the epithelial
4902

growth factor receptor. Most recently, we reported a phase
2, single-arm, open-label trial of bevacizumab and erlotinib that demonstrated an improved response rate, median
overall survival, and progression-free survival.73
Moreover, there are several ongoing clinical trials of
different vascularly targeted agents in patients with HCC,
as shown in Table 3.
Collectively, application of antiangiogenesis to
patients with advanced HCC leads to improvement in
survival despite surprisingly low response rates. There is
poor correlation between survival benefit and conventional methods of response assessment, such as Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), which
poses questions of how best to quantify efficacy of antiangiogenic agents. Despite tumors increasing in size, the observation of tumor necrosis in many studies is intriguing.
Therefore, in 2000, a panel of experts recommended that
the response criteria be amended to take into account tumor necrosis induced by treatment.79 Although the usefulness of tumor necrosis in assessing efficacy of
anticancer agents in HCC remains to be established, it is a
potentially significant clinical endpoint that warrants further investigation.

Future Directions
Presently, there are major deficiencies in all aspects of
HCC management, including poor screening methods
and lack of biomarkers to guide therapy. We believe that
ELISA detection of circulating VEGF-165 as a biomarker
should be investigated in these challenging areas. In
screening for HCC, early evidence suggested that both serum VEGF and plasma VEGF levels may improve test
characteristics when combined with the current practice
of testing for serum AFP and imaging. We suggest that
further study in HCC screening should examine the utility of plasma VEGF, because unlike serum VEGF, plasma
VEGF is not affected by blood coagulation. The utility of
plasma VEGF in this setting could be assessed in parallel
with the most commonly used HCC screening strategy of
combining serum AFP measurement every 3 months with
liver ultrasound every 6 months. Understanding the biologic role of VEGF and its influence on the clinicopathologic features of HCC highlights the potential role of
targeting VEGF in cancer therapies. The availability of
drugs that target VEGF itself (bevacizumab) or VEGF
receptors (sunitinib, sorafenib) provides opportunities to
develop newer approaches of combining those agents with
the current treatment options available for this disease (eg,
TACE) and other targeted therapies. The limited benefit
of conventional response monitoring by RECIST in
patients treated with antiangiogenesis emphasizes the importance of the development of biomarkers to monitor
treatment effects. To our knowledge, there currently are
Cancer

no studies that adequately address the biomarker role of
VEGF in patients treated with systemic antiangiogenic
agents. VEGF measurements should be investigated as
potential biomarkers to optimize antiangiogenic therapy,
in addition to monitoring the patientâ€™s response to
therapy.
