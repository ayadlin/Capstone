Abstract
Despite the great success in using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to treat
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the frequent development of multi-drug resistance,
particularly the T315I mutation of BCR-ABL, remains a challenging issue. Enhancement
of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity by dissociating its endogenous inhibitor
SET is an effective approach to combat TKI-based resistance. Here, we report the
identification of a novel 2-phenyloxypyrimidine compound TGI1002 to specifically
disrupt SET-PP2A interaction. By binding to SET, TGI1002 inhibits SET-PP2A
interaction and increases PP2A activity. In addition, knocking-down SET expression
decreases tumor cell sensitivity to TGI1002. TGI1002 treatments also markedly
increase dephosphorylation of BCR-ABL. Moreover, TGI1002 significantly inhibits
tumor growth and prolongs survival of xenografted mice implanted with BaF3p210T315I cells. These findings demonstrate that TGI1002 is a novel SET inhibitor with
important therapeutic potential for the treatment of drug-resistant CML.

INTRODUCTION

mutation spurred the design and development of the thirdgeneration TKIs, among which ponatinib is the only TKI
launched to the market [3, 6]. However, FDA halted its
clinical uses in 2013 after its accelerated approval for less
than a year, due to severe adverse events, such as blood
clots and narrowing of blood vessels [6]. Although it was
returned to the market later because of the lack of effective
alternatives for the treatment of CML patients with BCRABLT315I mutation, a black-box warning for arterial
thrombotic events was labeled on this drug [6]. Therefore,
the frequent and serious multi-TKI resistance has been a
major obstacle in the clinical treatment of CML, and novel
agents or alternative strategies to overcome BCR-ABL
mutations are still badly needed.
Previous studies indicated that hydrogen bonding
plays a vital role in the binding and inhibition of Abl-1
kinase by imatinib, especially the hydrogen bond between
hydroxyl group of Thr315 located at the active site of Abl-

CML is caused by constitutive tyrosine kinase
activity of BCR-ABL fusion protein, and great success has
been achieved from developing TKIs to treat this deadly
disease in clinical settings [1-5]. As the first TKI targeting
BCR-ABL kinase, imatinib has been a standard first-line
therapy for CML patients [3, 5]. However, approximately
one-third of CML patients became clinically resistant to
imatinib therapy after an initial response, and the most
prevalent mechanism is point mutations within BCRABL [3]. To overcome the BCR-ABL mutation-mediated
resistance, second-generation TKIs, such as nilotinib,
dasatinib and bosutinib, were subsequently developed and
have served as salvage therapies for the failures of imatinib
treatment. Unfortunately, they were still vulnerable to the
frequent gatekeeper mutation of T315I on BCR-ABL [1,
4, 5]. The vexing multi-inhibitor-resistant BCR-ABLT315I

tumor activity of TGI1002 is unlikely to be related to
kinase inhibition, implying that a new mechanism of
action could be involved in the anti-tumor activity. In
an effort to elucidate the mechanism, we used chemical
proteomics approach to identify the specific target of
TGI1002. Our studies showed that TGI1002 binds
specifically to the oncoprotein SET and increases PP2A
activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TGI1002 is
able to overcome multi-drug resistant CML with BCRABLT315I mutation through disrupting the interaction
between SET and PP2A.

1 kinase and 2-amino group at 2-aminophenylpyrimidine
core of imatinib [7, 8]. However, the source of proton
for the hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl and amino
groups was unclear. Because amino group could serve
as either proton donor or proton acceptor, hydrogen
bonding would be stronger if the amino group only
served as a proton acceptor. Therefore, to improve
proton accepting capability, we replaced 2-amino
group of imatinib by an oxygen atom and synthesized
a 2-phenyloxypyrimidine-based compound library to
test their inhibitory Effects on kinase activity and tumor
cell proliferation. After screening of the library with
different substitutions at 2-phenyloxypyrimidine core, we
surprisingly found that a novel compound N-(4-methyl3-((4-(pyridin-3-yl)-pyrimidin-2-yl)oxy)phenyl)-3-((4methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl)benzamide hydrochloride
(designated as TGI1002, Figure 1A) exhibits unique
biological activities, showing anti-proliferation activity
to a few tumor cell lines while having no significant
inhibition to most tested kinases including Abl-1. Based
on its chemical structure and the discrepancy between
kinase activity and tumor cell proliferation, the anti-

was characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS), 1H NMR, 13C NMR and IR (Supplementary
Figure S1).
The cytotoxicity of TGI1002 was evaluated in 20
human tumor cell lines using CellTiter-Glo assay. While
TGI1002 did not exhibit notable cytotoxicity to most cell
lines, cytotoxic effects against K562, PC-3 and HT-29
cells were observed (Figure 1B). Although the IC50 value
of TGI1002 at 72 h in the most sensitive K562 cells was
11.04 ± 1.98 µM (Figure 1C), approximately 35-fold less
potent than imatinib (0.31 ± 0.01 µM), TGI1002 could
reduce cell viabilities of TKI-resistant BaF3-p210T315I
cells with a comparable IC50 value (14.73 ± 2.61 µM) to
non-resistant K562 cells (Figure 1C). It should be noted
that the increase of TGI1002 sensitivity toward K562 or
BaF3-p210T315I BCR-ABL+ cells correlated with its ability
to induce dephosphorylation of BCR-ABL (Figure 1D).
To examine whether the cytotoxic activity by
TGI1002 is related to protein kinase inhibition, a panel

of 64 kinases including Tyr and Ser/Thr protein kinases
was screened to evaluate the inhibition of TGI1002 on
kinase activity using both Kinase-Glo Luminescent Kinase
Assay and ADP-Glo Assay. TGI1002 did not inhibit most
kinases except showing marginal inhibition on PDGFRα
and EphB2 with IC50 values of 3.28 µM and 1.27 µM
respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Given the fact that
PDGFRα and EphB2 are not expressed in K562 and BaF3p210T315I cells [9, 10] (Supplementary Figure S2), the
cytotoxicity by TGI1002 in these cell lines is not related
to the inhibition of these kinases, suggesting a mechanism
involving other untested kinases or an as yet undefined
mechanism.

Identification of cellular targets of TGI1002

potential targets of TGI1002, an affinity probe was

prepared as described in Supplementary Scheme 2. We
first introduced a carboxylic group onto N-demethylated
TGI1002 analogue 10 (Supplementary Figure S3) to
yield TGI1002-COOH (Figure 1A and Supplementary
Figure S4) and the resulting TGI1002-COOH exhibited
a comparable cytotoxicity in K562 cells to the parent
compound (Figure 1C), indicating that the additional
carboxylic group did not alter its biological activity.
TGI1002-COOH was then coupled with EAH-Sepharose
4B through an amide bond and the resulting TGI1002affinity probe was confirmed by IR spectral comparison
(Supplementary Figure S5) and used to incubate with
cell lysates of K562 cells. Compared to the non-specific
binding proteins with blank matrices (Figure 2A, up
panel), four proteins (BP1-BP4) decreased in amount by
the affinity probe as shown on SDS-PAGE after serial
affinity chromatography [11, 12] (Figure 2A, down panel),
indicating that they are binding proteins and potential
targets for TGI1002. These four protein bands were
subsequently excised from the gel for tryptic digestion and
MALDI-TOF MS analyses. MS results revealed that the
binding proteins are HSP90AA1, β-tubulin, acetylcholine
receptor-associated protein (Rapsyn) and SET protein,
respectively (Supplementary Table S2).
Chaperone protein Hsp90 plays an important role
in the proper function and stability of a large number
of proteins. Hsp90 inhibitors can bind to Hsp90 and
specifically inhibit its chaperone function, resulting in the
degradation of HSP90-associated proteins, such as BCR-

ABL (known as an Hsp90 client protein) in CML cells
[13]. Therefore, in the present study, effects of TGI1002
on the expression of BCR-ABL were investigated and
compared with a specific Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG. As
shown in Figure 2B, the expression level of BCR-ABL
in K562 cells was not affected by TGI1002, whereas
BCR-ABL was significantly degraded after 17-DMAG
treatment, suggesting that HSP90 is not a functional target
for TGI1002.
Given that tubulin-binding drugs, such as paclitaxel
and Vinca alkaloids, act to suppress microtubule dynamics
[14], we next examined if TGI1002 plays a role in
microtubule-stabilization or microtubule-destabilization
in K562 cells. However, the amounts of tubulin in the
depolymerized fraction “S” and polymerized fraction “P”
were not affected by TGI1002, suggesting that TGI1002
is not involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics
(Figure 2C).
Although 14 tryptic peptide sequences of BP3
matched amino acid sequence of Rapsyn, there was a
major discrepancy between the molecular weight of BP3
(~40 kDa) and that of Rapsyn (~47.5 kDa). In addition,
Rapsyn has only been known for directing and clustering
acetylcholine receptors during cellular differentiation and
neuromuscular junction formation [15]. Although the
expression of Rapsyn in certain types of nonmuscle cells
suggested its additional functions [16], there has been no
evidence on its involvement in tumor development. Based
on these facts [15, 16], Rapsyn was preliminarily ruled out

Effects on SET binding and PP2A activity by
TGI1002

as a potential target of TGI1002.
To examine whether SET protein mediates the
effects of TGI1002, the expression of SET was knocked
down in K562 cells and the sensitivity of the cells against
TGI1002 was then compared. A K562 cell line with stable
knock-down of SET was established using recombinant
lentivirus expression vector encoding small hairpin
RNA (shRNA) against human SET gene, and suppressed
expression of SET was observed by Western blotting
(Figure 2D). Subsequent cytotoxicity assays also showed
that SET-specific shRNA decreased the sensitivity of K562
cells to TGI1002 treatment (Figure 2E). Together, the data
suggest that SET oncoprotein may be the specific target of
TGI1002, and we therefore focused our efforts on SET for
subsequent investigation.

To examine whether TGI1002 interacts with SET
directly, microscale thermophoresis (MST) was employed
in the present study, which enables the quantitative
analysis of molecular interactions in solution at microliter
scale [17]. Soluble recombinant human SET protein in
full length was expressed in E. coli [18], purified by Niaffinity chromatography (Supplementary Figure S6) and
labeled with RED fluorescent dye NT-647-NHS. MST
was performed by titrating various concentrations of
the compounds into NT647-labeled SET protein using
COG112, a peptide SET inhibitor [19], as a positive
control and imatinib as a negative control. COG112
bound SET protein with a Kd value of 4.40±0.39 μΜ
(Figure 3A), whereas imatinib did not bind SET to give
a meaningful Kd value (Figure 3B). TGI1002 bound to

SET-PP2Ac interaction in murine BaF3-p210T315I cells. SET and PP2Ac protein complexes were immunoprecipitated and analyzed for SET

SET protein with a Kd value of 1.66±0.45 μM (Figure 3C
and 3D), exhibiting stronger binding affinity to SET than
COG112. These observations provide strong support that
TGI1002 interacts directly with SET protein.
Given that SET is an endogenous inhibitor of
the multimeric Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP2A [18,
19], we next investigated if the binding of TGI1002
with SET protein disrupts the association of SET and
PP2A and consequently affect PP2A activity. Coimmunoprecipitation assay showed a trend of decrease
on the association between SET and PP2A in K562 cells
without significant alteration of SET expression in the
presence of TGI1002 (Figure 4A). Meanwhile, there was

a tendency on the decrease of catalytic subunit of PP2A
(PP2Ac) phosphorylation although lower doses did not
show obvious changes (Figure 4A). In addition, PP2A
activity, as determined by PP2Ac immunoprecipitation
phosphatase assay, was enhanced by 144.67 ± 5.51% after
TGI1002-treatment (10 μM, 24 h) in K562 cells compared
to untreated cells (Figure 4B). In the presence of specific
PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) [19], PP2A activity
decreased significantly compared to control. However,
upon TGI1002 treatments, the inhibition of PP2A by
OA was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in K562
cells (Figure 4B), further confirming that the increase
of PP2A activity was a result of the interaction between

TGI1002 and SET. When we treated the drug-resistant
BaF3-p210T315I cells, similar to non-resistant K562 cells,
TGI1002 disrupted the association of SET with PP2A ,
down-regulated phosphorylated PP2Ac, increased PP2A
activity and antagonized the inhibitory effects of OA on
PP2A (Figure 4C and 4D), suggesting that TGI1002 may
be active and useful for the treatment of drug-resistant
CML with T315I mutation of BCR-ABL.

injection of BaF3-p210T315I cells were 51.07%, 53.15% and
68.01%, respectively. With regard to the survival of tumorbearing mice, administration of TGI1002 or ponatinib also
significantly improved the survival of mice intravenously
injected BaF3-p210T315I cells in a dose-dependent manner,
while treatment with imatinib had no obvious effects. The
median survival of mice xenografted BaF3-p210T315I cells
was prolonged to 32.5 days and 37 days by TGI1002 (30
mg/kg) and ponatinib (10 mg/kg) respectively, compared
with 25.5 days or 25 days for vehicle or imatinib (10 mg/
kg, the effective dose against non-resistant CML) treated
mice (Figure 5D).
To ascertain that the binding of TGI1002 to SET is
responsible for the anti-tumor activity of TGI1002 in vivo,
we analyzed the interaction of SET with PP2A in tumor
tissues from the xenografted mice. As anticipated, the
disrupting effects of TGI1002 were also observed in tumor
tissues. Further analysis of other related proteins showed
that the levels of SET and BCR-ABL were not affected
by TGI1002, whereas the levels of phosphorylated BCRABL (active form of BCR-ABL) were markedly reduced
upon TGI1002 treatment (Figure 5E). Collectively, these
results strongly support that the disruption of SET-PP2A
interaction by TGI1002 results in the decrease of tumor
growth and extension of survival of tumor-bearing mice
(Figure 6).

In vivo confirmation of anti-tumor activity of
TGI1002
To test in vivo anti-tumor activity of TGI1002 and
further confirm that TGI1002 directly act on the interaction
of SET-PP2A, a xenografted mouse model bearing BaF3p210T315I was established by implanting tumor cells,
and TGI1002 was intraperitoneally administrated to
determine anti-tumor efficacy using ponatinib as a positive
control. Statistical analyses indicated that tumor growth
was significantly inhibited by TGI1002 (Figure 5). The
final tumor volume and weight were markedly lower in
TGI1002 and ponatinib-treated mice compared to vehicle
group, whereas imatinib did not show apparent effects
on tumor growth (Figure 5A-C). The inhibition of tumor
growth, in terms of tumor volume, of 30, 45 and 60 mg/
kg TGI1002 (without loss of body weight) on day 20 post-

DISCUSSION

tissues; and (4) a dose-dependent efficacy by TGI1002
in xenografted mice implanted with drug-resistant BaF3p210T315I cells was confirmed from both tumor growth and
survival.
SET oncoprotein is a potent and specific endogenous
inhibitor of tumor suppressor PP2A in cytoplasm, its overexpression and inactivation of PP2A activity was recently
recognized as a common event in leukemogenesis [2327]. Hence, increase of cytosolic PP2A activity through
dissociating SET by PP2A-activating drugs or SETbinding peptides has been indicated as a promising
approach to overcome TKI-based drug resistance [28,
29]. Recent studies have resulted in the identification of
sphingosine analogue FTY720 (fingolimod, Gilenya;
Novartis) and SET binding peptides, such as COG112 and
OP449, as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of
leukemogenesis [29-32].
In this study, the ability of TGI1002 to dissociate
SET from PP2A and to increase PP2A activity was
observed both in vitro and in vivo. Decrease of PP2A
phosphorylation was previously regarded as a major event
to increase PP2A activity [26, 27]. The present study did
show a tendency of decrease in PP2A phosphorylation
upon TGI1002 treatments at high doses. However, no
significant changes were observed at low concentrations
of TGI1002. Therefore, we reason that the increase of
PP2A activity by TGI1002 could be a synergetic effect
of SET inhibition and PP2A dephosphorylation. Because
the efficacy of peptide SET inhibitor OP449 was only
confirmed in mice xenografted with drug-sensitive human
acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells [29], ponatinib,
the only therapeutic agent for T315I mutation of
CML patients, was chosen as a positive control for the
comparison of in vivo efficacy. Although the in vivo antitumor efficacy of TGI1002 was less potent than the typical
TKI ponatinib, potential clinical efficacy of TGI1002 may
not be necessarily lower under complex disease conditions
due to the mechanistic difference. Meanwhile, it would be
of interest to evaluate the synergetic effects by combining
TGI1002 with other therapeutic agents possessing
different mechanisms, and such combinational therapies
are currently under investigation.
In summary, the present study provided a novel
compound and chemotype to combat multi-drug resistant
CML, particularly the T315I mutation. Compound
TGI1002 containing 2-phenoxypyrimidine structure
exerted its anti-leukemic activity by directly interacting
with SET oncoprotein to disrupt the association of
SET and PP2A, resulting in the activation of PP2A and
the suppression of BCR-ABL activity. To address the
important unmet medical needs, the novel compound, new
chemotype and the mechanism of action revealed in the
present study provide a potentially new treatment option
for the patients with Philadelphia choromosome-positive
leukemias.

Given the decisive role of BCR-ABL in the
development of CML, TKI-based therapy has been
regarded as the gold standard for the treatment of CML
since the excellent clinical performance of the first TKI,
imatinib. The magic bullet of imatinib did revolutionize
CML therapy and bring substantial benefits to CML
patients. However, it was also the initiator of BCR-ABL
mutations to acquire drug resistance. Since then, numerous
efforts have been put on the road to battle various BCRABL mutations, and second and third generations of
TKIs have been developed over the past decade [3].
Unfortunately, the pace of drug development has not been
able to keep up with the emergence of drug resistance.
Recently, T315I-inclusive compound mutations conferring
ponatinib (the only currently approved pan-BCR-ABL
inhibitor) resistance was reported [20, 21]. This serious
situation highlights the need to develop new therapeutic
strategies to offer more options for multi-drug resistant
CML patients.
Imatinib contains a 2-aminophenylprimidine
core structure, in which hydrogen bondings are critical
for competitive binding with ATP binding packet to
inactivate Abl-1 kinase activity [7, 8]. Among the
hydrogen bonds, the one between 2-amino group at
2-aminophenylpyrimidine core of imatinib and the
gatekeeper residue Thr315 of Abl-1 kinase is particularly
important according to the small molecule-protein
complex structure [7, 8]. In the present study, we
designed and synthesized a 2-phenyloxypyrimidine-based
library aiming to increase proton accepting capability
and consequent stronger inhibition on Abl-1 kinase. To
our surprise, we found that compound TGI1002 shows
moderate cytotoxicity only to a few cell lines and the
cytotoxicity is not related to kinase inhibition, suggesting
that a different mechanism from imatinib underlies its
anti-tumor activity.
Affinity-based chemical proteomics has been a
powerful tool to identify the molecular targets of bioactive
small molecules [11, 12, 22]. In the present study, we
employed this approach to examine if TGI1002 can bind
to a specific protein in K562 cells. After three rounds
of serial affinity chromatography, four proteins were
captured by the TGI1002-affinity probe and subsequently
identified by MALDI-TOF-MS analyses. After
preliminarily excluding the involvement of other proteins,
SET oncoprotein was confirmed to be the specificbinding protein responsible for the anti-tumor activity of
TGI1002 with following evidence: (1) shRNA-mediated
knock-down of SET expression significantly reduced
the sensitivity of K562 cells to TGI1002; (2) TGI1002
could directly bind recombinant human SET protein with
high affinity determined by MST; (3) the disruption of
SET-PP2A interaction by TGI1002 was observed from
co-imminoprecipitaton in both tumor cell lines and

PP2Ac (#2038) were from CST; antibodies to p-PP2Ac
(Y307) (#sc-12615-R), EphB2 (#sc-1763), PDGFRα (#sc338), β-actin (#sc-47778) and β-tubulin (#sc-9104) were
from Santa Cruz; antibodies to SET (#ab1183) was from
Abcam. 17-DMAG was acquired from Selleck Chemicals.
Okadaic acid (OA) and other reagents and solvents were
analytical grade and from Sigma-Aldrich unless noted
otherwise.

Then, TGI1002-COOH was synthesized from 10 based
on a previous report [34]. The structures of 10 and
TGI1002-COOH were confirmed by HRMS, 1H NMR,
13
C NMR and IR. TGI1002-affinity probe was prepared
by coupling TGI1002-COOH with EAH-sepharose 4B
with the same conditions as described previously [11,
12]. Briefly, 0.5 mL EAH-sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare
Biosciences AB) was successively washed with deionized
water (pH 4.5), 0.5 M NaCl and PBS (pH 7.4), and
suspended in PBS (pH 7.4). TGI1002-COOH (2.5 mg, 4.4
μmol) dissolved in 0.5 mL deionized water (pH 4.5) and
0.1 M 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) were added to the resin suspension.
The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and
dried. The resulting matrices were washed thoroughly with
methanol and water, characterized by IR spectroscopy
and kept in an aqueous solution containing 20% ethanol
until used in binding experiments. The coupling rate
of TGI1002-COOH to EAH-sepharose was 32.1% by
determining the residual TGI1002-COOH using HPLC.

Cell culture

Cytotoxicity assay

Tumor cell lines of ACHN, 786-O, A549, CCRFCEM, HL-60, K562, MOLT4, Colo 205, HCT-15,
HCT116, HT-29, DU145, PC-3, MDA-MB-231, MCF7,
HS578T, OVCAR-3, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL and U251 were
obtained in February 2012 from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and authenticated by microsatellite
genotyping. A549 and PC-3 cells were grown in F12K
medium; 786-O, DU145, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, HS578T,
SK-MEL-28 and U251 cells were grown in DMEM
medium; ACHN, CCRF-CEM, HL-60, K562, MOLT4,
Colo 205, HCT-15 and OVCAR-3 cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 medium; HT-29, HCT116 and SK-OV-3 cells
were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium. BaF3 cell lines
harboring either wild type (p210) or T315I mutation of
BCR-ABL kinase (p210T315I) were generous gifts from
Prof. Xiaoguang Chen (Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing,
China) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. All media
contained 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence
of 100 units/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin.
Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 95% air and 5% CO2.

Twenty types of tumor cell lines were seeded at
4000 cells per well in 96-well plates. TGI1002 dissolved in
phosphate saline was added to cells at final concentrations
ranging from 0.5 nM to 100 µM for 120 h. Cell viability
was measured with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell
Viability Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Luminescence was measured using an
EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin-Elmer). The
cytotoxicity of TGI1002 was expressed as the percentage
of luminescence relative to that of untreated cells.

Materials

In vitro kinase assay
All kinase reactions were carried out in 384-well
plates. After addition of the compounds, kinase and ATPsubstrate were added to the assay plates successively, the
assay plates were centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 1 min and
incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Then, Kinase-Glo Plus or ADPGlo reagent was added to each well. In Kinase-Glo assay,
after addition of the reagent for 20 min, the luminescence
was measured on an EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader
(Perkin-Elmer). In ADP-Glo assay, after addition of the
reagent for 40 min, Kinase Detection Reagent was added
and incubated for another 30 min at 27 °C, and then the
luminescence was measured. Kinase inhibition rates were
calculated per manufacturer’s instructions.

Synthesis of TGI1002 and TGI1002-affinity probe
TGI1002 was synthesized according to the synthetic
route (Supplementary Scheme 1).The structure of
TGI1002 was determined by HRMS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR
and IR. TGI1002-affinity probe was then synthesized
from TGI1002 (Supplementary Scheme 2). First, an
N-demethyl-derivative of TGI1002 (10) was synthesized
based on Supplementary Scheme 1 with slight change, in
which 1-methyl-piperazine was replaced by piperazine.

Capture and identification of specific binding
proteins

Stable transfection and selection of K562 cell line
with SET-knockdown

According to previously reported method of serial
affinity chromatography10,11, lysates of K562 cells (200
µL) were stirred gently with TGI1002-affinity probe
(60 µL) or blank matrices (EAH sepharose 4B) at 4
°C for approximately 40 min and then precipitated by
centrifugation at 8,000 x g for 3 min. The supernatants
were mixed with 60 µL of TGI1002-affinity probe or blank
matrices at 4 °C, and incubated for approximately 40 min.
The resulting resins were successively washed for three
series with 0.6 ml of lysate buffer containing 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl
and 0.5% NP-40 supplemented with a cocktail of protease
and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). The mixtures were
then resuspended in 40 µL of SDS loading buffer, boiled
at 100 °C for 5 min, and then centrifuged for 3 min. The
supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After silver
staining of the gels, the protein bands were comparatively
analyzed between the affinity probe and blank matrices
to identify specific binding proteins. Individual protein
band on the SDS-PAGE gel was excised and digested with
trypsin. Tryptic peptides were analyzed on an Ultraflex II
MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany) in positive-ionization mode over the m/z range
of 700 to 4000 at resolution of 15,000 to 20,000. Protein
sequence identification was performed with the peptide
mass fingerprint using the Mascot Search engine (version
2.4) as previously reported [35].

Lentivirus-encoded shRNA against human SET
(GenBank No.: NM_003011) and a noncoding gene
(negative control) were prepared by Genechem and titered
to 2 × 108 (TU/mL). K562 cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were
seeded in 96-well plates overnight before transfection. The
virus (10 μL) was mixed with 90 μL complete medium
containing polybrene (5 μg/mL) and added to cells and
incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. Then, the cells were incubated
in fresh complete RPMI 1640 medium for 72 h, followed
by incubation in complete medium containing puromycin
(5 μg/mL). After 2 weeks of selection, individual clones
were isolated, passaged and harvested for subsequent
studies. Identification of stable SET-knockdown K562
cell line was performed by Western blotting. Effects of
TGI1002 on cell viability of SET-knockdown K562 cells
were studied as described above.

Soluble expression and purification of human
SET protein in E. coli
Genes encoding the full length of human SET
(GenBank No.: AAA60318.1) was synthesized by
Shanghai Generay Biotech Co., Ltd and subcloned
into pET-21a expression vector. The expression and
purification of recombinant human SET protein was
carried out as described previously [18]. The protein was
purified to homogeneity on SDS-PAGE and concentrated
with a centrifugal filter device (Millipore). Protein
concentrations were quantified by BCA assay (KeyGen).

Microtubule assembly assay
Separation of insoluble polymerized tubulin from
soluble tubulin dimers and analysis of the effects of
TGI1002 on tubulin polymerization were performed as
described previously [36]. In brief, K562 cells at a density
of 1 x 106/100 mm2 dishes were treated with indicated
concentrations of TGI1002 at 24 h. Cells were washed
with PBS for three times before adding polymerization
lysate buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH6.8), 1
mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 20 g/mL aprotinin, 20 g/mL
leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM
orthovanadate and 0.5% Nonidet. After centrifugation
at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellets were
resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and dissolved
by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Beta-tubulin was then
Western blotted from both pellets (containing polymerized
microtubules) and supernatants (containing depolymerized
microtubules).

Fluorescence microscale thermophoresis (MST)
Purified SET protein was labeled with dye NT647
using a Monolith NTTM Protein Labeling Kit (NanoTemper
Technologies). Serial dilutions of TGI1002, COG112
or imatinib (up to 2 mM) were mixed with 15 μM of
NT647-labeled SET protein, incubated for 10 min at room
temperature in 20 mM PBS (pH 8.0) and loaded into
the standard glass capillaries (Monolith NT Capillaries,
NanoTemper). Thermophoresis analysis was performed
during 30 s on a NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 instrument
(20% LED, 40% MST power) at 25 °C. The MST curves
were fitted using NT Analysis software (NanoTemper
Technologies) to obtain Kd values for binding between
SET and TGI1002, COG112 or imatinib, respectively.

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
Protein samples (40 µg) were resolved on
SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto PVDF membranes
(Millipore) and incubated overnight with primary

antibodies to β-tubulin, BCR-ABL, p-BCR-ABL, SET,
PP2Ac and p-PP2Ac. The membranes were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 h, and the bands were visualized using
an ECL detection kit following the manufacturer’s
instructions. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM MgCl and 0.5% NP-40 supplemented with a cocktail
of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Lysates
(200 µg) were incubated with primary antibodies (1 µg)
against SET or PP2Ac at 4 °C for 10 h, protein A/G plus
agarose beads were then added for immunoprecipitation
overnight at 4 °C. After wash, the immunoprecipitated
proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by
Western blotting.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using
GraphPad Prism version 6.01 for Windows. Data are
expressed as mean ± s.d. of three independent experiments.
The significance of the data was determined by one-way
ANOVA analysis unless otherwise noted. P value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

BABL/c male mice from SLRC Experimental
Animal Center were bred under pathogen-free conditions
and were used for experiments at 6-8 weeks of age. Animal
experiments were performed according to institutional and
national guidelines. BaF3-p210T315I cells were implanted
subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice (200 μL
of a 1 × 107cells suspension in serum free medium). When
tumors became large enough for caliper measurement,
tumor volumes were calculated as (length × width2) × 0.5.
Once tumors reached 100-200 mm3, mice were randomly
assigned to 6 groups with approximate equalization of
tumor volumes among different groups. TGI1002 (30,
45 and 60 mg/kg), imatinib (10 mg/kg), ponatinib (10
mg/kg), or vehicle (phosphate saline) was administered
daily by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.). At the end of the
experiments, tumors were dissected and photographed,
and wet weights of each tumor were measured.
In survival study, BaF3-p210T315I cells were injected
into the tail vein of BALB/c mice (100 μL of a 1 × 107
cells suspension in serum free medium). Five days later,
mice were treated once daily by i.p. with vehicle, TGI1002
(15, 30 mg/kg), imatinib (10 mg/kg) and ponatinib (10 mg/
kg). Moribund animals were sacrificed as per institutional
and national guidelines. Survival data were analyzed by
