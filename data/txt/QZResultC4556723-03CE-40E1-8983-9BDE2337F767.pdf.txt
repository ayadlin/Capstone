Abstract
The mitotic spindle checkpoint plays a crucial role in
regulating accurate chromosome segregation and preventing
the adaptation of multiploid progeny cells. Recent reports
have indicated that the induction of p53 by mitotic checkpoint
activation is essential for protecting cells from abnormal
chromosome ploidization caused by mitotic failure. However,
although studies have shown that p53 deficiencies arrest
mitosis, compromise apoptosis, and may cause profound
aneuploidy, the molecular mechanisms leading to p53
induction following mitotic checkpoint activation remain
unknown. Here, we show that the BubR1 mitotic checkpoint
kinase interacts with p53 both in vitro and in vivo, with higher
levels of interaction in mitotic cells. This interaction contributes to p53 phosphorylation. Silencing of BubR1 expression
reduces the phosphorylation and stability of p53, whereas
exogenous introduction of BubR1 proteins into BubR1depleted cells recovers p53 stability. In addition, inhibition
of BubR1 expression in the presence of a microtubule
inhibitor accelerates chromosomal instability and polyploidy
in p53-null cells. These results collectively suggest that p53
activation in response to mitotic spindle damage requires
signaling via BubR1-mediated phosphorylation. [Cancer Res
2007;67(15):7155–64]

Introduction
Spindle damage induces prolonged arrest of cellular mitosis, but
the cells eventually enter the G1 phase despite failed chromosome
segregation and/or cytokinesis. Under normal conditions, these
cells undergo a second, p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, and
eventually succumb to apoptotic cell death (1–4). However, p53deficient cells do not undergo this second arrest and eventually
adapt and become profoundly polyploid (and eventually aneuploid)
in a manner similar to that observed in cells deficient for mitotic
checkpoint proteins (2, 5–8). Recent studies have shown that
treatment with microtubule inhibitors induces p53 protein
expression only after tetraploid cells exit mitotic arrest and
progress to interphase (9). Notably, chromosome nondisjunction
results in tetraploidization via mitotic failure (10) and p53 has an
intrinsic ability to eliminate tetraploid cells (11) that may otherwise

proceed to aneuploidy (12). These findings strongly suggest that
p53 acts at some point in the postmitotic cell cycle, particularly in
cases of mitotic defect. Other studies have shown that microtubule
disruption induces prolonged mitotic arrest in association with
phosphorylation-induced stabilization of the p53 protein (13).
Thus, the induction and/or activation of p53 by mitotic checkpoint
activation seems to be essential for protecting cells against the
abnormal chromosomal ploidization induced by mitotic defects.
Furthermore, these previous findings suggest the existence of
functional cross-talk between the mitotic checkpoint and p53dependent postmitotic controls. Nevertheless, the molecular
mechanisms governing p53 activation following prolonged, checkpoint-activated mitotic arrest have not yet been fully elucidated.
During mitotic checkpoint activation, BubR1 and other checkpoint components form an inhibitory ternary complex with an E3
ubiquitin ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex, and its
substrate-specific activator, Cdc20. BubR1 monitors the proper
attachment of microtubules to kinetochores, and links the
regulation of chromosome-spindle attachment to mitotic checkpoint signaling (14–16). Several studies have shown that disruption
of BubR1 activity results in a loss of checkpoint control,
chromosomal instability (caused by premature anaphase), and/or
early onset of malignancy (14, 17–19). We previously showed that
BubR1 functions as a potent apoptotic molecule for preventing the
adaptation of abnormal, chromosomally unstable mitotic cells (20).
Collectively, these observations suggest that BubR1 forms a
functional link between prolonged mitotic checkpoint activation
and subsequent postmitotic adaptation.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid construction and generation of recombinant adenovirus.
The full-length cDNA sequence of the human BubR1 gene has been previously
described (14). The cDNA fragments of the BubR1 gene were PCR-amplified and
inserted into the pCMV-HA vector to generate pCMV-HA-BubR1 wild-type
(WT), 1 to 525 and 526 to 1050. The cDNAs for BubR1 WT, 1 to 525 and 526 to
1050, and two mutant versions of BubR1, K795R and F1022S, were subcloned
into the Myc epitope-encoding pcDNA3.1 vector to generate pcDNA-MycBubR1 WT, 1 to 525, 526 to 1050, K795R, and F1022S. Glutathione S-transferase
(GST) fusion constructs for expression in Escherichia coli were generated by inframe insertion of PCR fragments encoding BubR1 amino acid residues 1 to 300,
1 to 525, 401 to 700, and 526 to 1050 into the pGEX-KG vector (Pharmacia). The
p53 deletion mutant was constructed by in-frame insertion of restriction
fragments encoding p53 amino acids 1 to 144 or 143 to 393 into the pGEX-KG
vector. The human BubR1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression plasmids
were created by inserting two sets of siRNA oligonucleotides (5¶-gatccccaagggttcagagccatcagttcaagagactgatggctctgaaccctttttttggaaa-3¶/

siRNA and pSuper-BubR1 siRNA plasmids, respectively. The recombinant
adenovirus expressing wild-type BubR1 has been previously described (20).
Cell lines and establishment of stable knock-down cells. HeLa cells
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in
DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone). The p53-null
HCT116 (HCT116-p53KO) cells were kindly provided by Bert Vogelstein. The
HCT116, HCT116-p53KO, HCT116-BubR1KD, and HCT116-p53KO/BubR1KD
cells were grown in McCoy’s supplemented medium (Life Technologies)
containing 10% FBS. The stable BubR1KD cell lines were generated by
transfecting the HCT116 and HCT116-p53KO cells with either pSuper-BubR1
siRNA or the empty pSuper.Retro.puro vector. Colonies showing resistance
to puromycin (10 Ag/mL) were clonally isolated, and immunoblotting and
immunofluorescence assays with an anti-BubR1 antibody (BD Biosciences
PharMingen) were used to screen for the suppression of BubR1 expression.
In vitro binding assays and immunoprecipitation. For the GST pulldown assays, the fusion proteins were adsorbed onto glutathione-protein
A/G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with wholecell extracts (4 mg) from asynchronized or nocodazole-treated HeLa or
HCT116 cells. The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and either
p53 or BubR1 were detected by immunoblotting with the corresponding
antibody. The in vitro–translated BubR1 protein was produced using a TNTcoupled transcription/translation kit (Promega). For immunoprecipitation,
asynchronized or nocodazole-treated HeLa cells were lysed in an
immunoprecipitation buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1% NP40, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), and 1 mmol/L DTT] containing a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma). Each cell extract was incubated with antibodies against BubR1 or
p53, or normal IgG (control) for 2 h at 4jC, followed by incubation with
protein A/G-Sepharose beads for an additional 2 h. The beads were pelleted,

washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and analyzed by
immunoblotting.
In vitro kinase assays. The cell lysates were incubated with either
monoclonal anti-BubR1 antibody or normal mouse IgG, followed by an
additional incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose beads. The beads were
washed twice with a kinase buffer [100 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmol/L
EDTA (pH 8), 20 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L MnCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT,
1 mmol/L PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail], and reacted with 4 Ag of
purified GST or GST-p53 in the presence of 10 ACi of [g32P]ATP at 37jC for
30 min. The BubR1 immunocomplexes described above were incubated
with either GST or GST-p53 in the presence of 50 mmol/L of unlabeled ATP.
The phosphorylation of p53 was detected by immunoblotting with
antibodies specific to p53 phosphorylated at Ser15, Ser20, and Ser46. The
immunoprecipitated HA- and Myc-tagged BubR1 proteins were washed
with kinase buffer and then incubated with GST-p53 in the presence of
10 ACi of [g32P]ATP. The GST-p53 proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
visualized by autoradiography.
Synchronization and cell cycle analysis. Synchronized populations
were generated by treating the control HCT116 and HCT116-BubR1KD cells
with nocodazole (200 ng/mL) for 12 h, and then releasing them into normal
culture medium in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (50 Ag/mL).
The cells were harvested at various times after synchronization, and
processed for immunoblotting analysis. For flow cytometric analyses,
control HCT116 and HCT116-BubR1KD cells were treated with 300 ng/mL of
nocodazole, harvested at various times posttreatment, and then fixed and
stained with propidium iodide for flow cytometric analysis. The DNA
contents of 10,000 cells per sample were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson
FACScan cytometer using the CellQuest and WinMDI2.8 software packages.

and lysed in a lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1% NP40, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 1 mmol/L DTT] containing a protease inhibitor
cocktail. Equal amounts of protein (quantified by Bio-Rad assay) from each
sample were run on an SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter,
blocked, and analyzed with anti-BubR1 (BD Biosciences PharMingen), antiBub3 (BD Biosciences PharMingen), anti-p53 (Santa Cruz Technology), antiMDM2, (Santa Cruz Technology), anti-Actin (Sigma), anti-phospho p53
Ser15, Thr18, Ser20, Ser46, and Ser392 (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-HA
(Roche) antibodies. For immunofluorescence, the cells were cultured on
18-mm coverslips and fixed in 5% formaldehyde for 10 min. The fixed cells
were washed, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and
incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at room temperature for
2 h. The cells were then washed and further incubated for 1 h with goat
anti-mouse IgG conjugated with either FITC or Cy5. The cells were washed,
stained with Hoechst dye for visualization of DNA, and viewed under a
confocal microscope (Zeiss 510 Meta).
Live cell imaging. To estimate the duration of mitosis, cells were
transfected with an expression plasmid encoding H2B-GFP for visualization
of chromosomes, and then imaged in DT 0.15 mm dishes in McCoy’s
supplemented medium containing 10% FBS. Every 2 min for 2 h, 0.5-s
exposures were acquired using a 20 NA0.75 objective on an LSM500 META
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss).

Results
BubR1 interacts with p53 in vitro and in vivo. To elucidate
how BubR1 monitors mitotic and/or postmitotic cell cycle
regulation, we used a complex proteomics approach to screen for
novel BubR1-interacting proteins. Briefly, we extracted total cellular
proteins from HeLa cells, immunoprecipitated these proteins with
anti-BubR1 antibody, and analyzed the resulting immunocomplexes
by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization-time of flight analysis led to the identification of several
BubR1-interacting molecules, including p53.
To begin assessing the importance of this putative p53-BubR1
interaction, we first confirmed its existence by generating a fulllength p53/GST fusion protein, and then used immunoblotting to
detect the p53-BubR1 interaction in the in vitro–translated extract
(Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3). Pull-down assays revealed that GST-p53 did in

fact bind to BubR1. Similarly, we generated a full-length BubR1/GST
fusion protein and examined the interaction between GST-BubR1
and purified His-p53 (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6), which again revealed that
BubR1 and p53 were present in the complex formed in vitro.
Consistent with these findings, immunoprecipitation with antiBubR1 antibody and subsequent immunoblotting with an anti-p53
antibody (or the reverse experiment) showed that BubR1 and p53
form a complex in vivo (Fig. 1B). To define the domains responsible
for this BubR1-p53 interaction, we incubated a series of GST-BubR1
and GST-p53 deletion mutants with extracts from HeLa cells
expressing wild-type BubR1 or p53. As shown in Fig. 1C, a fragment
consisting of the BubR1 NH2-terminal homology domain (amino
acids 1–300), which is required for the kinetochore localization of
BubR1, formed a complex with p53, whereas the central and COOHterminal regions of BubR1 did not. Similarly, a fragment containing
the NH2-terminal end of p53 (amino acids 1–143), which is required
for transcriptional activity and MDM2 binding, interacted with
BubR1, whereas amino acids 144 to 393 of p53, containing the DNAbinding and oligomerization motifs, did not (Fig. 1D). In a positive
control experiment, we confirmed that BubR1 and p53 interacted
with their well-defined binding partners, Bub3 and MDM2,
respectively, under these experimental conditions (Fig. 1C and D).
To determine whether the BubR1-p53 interaction was regulated
in a cell cycle–dependent manner, we treated asynchronized
HeLa cells with the microtubule-inhibiting agent nocodazole for 14
h (to generate synchronized cells), and then released cells into the
cell cycle for 2 h (to generate postreleased cells). As shown in
Fig. 2A, flow cytometry analysis revealed that a larger proportion of
treated cells were in the M phase, and that the phosphorylations of
both BubR1 and histone H3, as mitotic markers, were rapidly
elevated in these cells (Fig. 2B); moreover, this response has been
shown to be required for checkpoint control (14, 15). Next, we
assessed the relationship between the cell cycle and the BubR1-p53
interaction by incubating GST-p53(1–143) or GST-p53(144–393)
with endogenous BubR1, and found that the interaction between
GST-p53(1–143) and BubR1 was significantly higher in synchronized cells than in asynchronized or postreleased cells (Fig. 2C). To
confirm this result, we immunoprecipitated endogenous p53 from

contents. Asyn, asynchronized cells (A ). Lysates from asynchronized or synchronized HeLa cells were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-BubR1, anti–phospho-H3

Functional Interaction between BubR1 and p53

BubR1 kinase contributes to phosphorylation of p53. To
examine whether the BubR1-p53 interaction leads to p53 phosphorylation, protein lysates from control and nocodazole-treated HeLa
cells were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for p53
phosphorylated at residues Ser9, Ser15, Ser20, Ser46, or Ser392.
Interestingly, nocodazole treatment for 16 h increased total p53
protein levels and the phosphorylations of p53 at Ser15 and Ser46,
whereas the phosphorylation levels at Ser9, Ser20, and Ser392 were

unaltered (Fig. 3A; Supplemental Fig. S1). Consistent with previous
reports (8, 13, 21), our results suggest that p53 is phosphorylated
and activated in response to late-stage mitotic spindle damage.
Therefore, to determine whether the observed increase in phosphop53 was due to BubR1 activity, we did in vitro BubR1 kinase assays
using GST-p53 as a substrate. Immunoprecipitation of BubR1 from
HeLa cells followed by incubation with [g32P]ATP and GST-p53
or GST alone revealed that the BubR1 immunocomplexes clearly

harvested for immunoblotting using antiBubR1, anti-p53, or anti-actin antibodies.
B, BubR1 knock-down (HCT116BubR1KD) cells were established from
HCT116 parental cells (control), as
described in Materials and Methods.
HCT116 and HCT116-BubR1KD cells were
stained with anti-hBubR1 antibodies
(green ), and DNA was visualized using
Hoechst dye (blue ). C, HCT116 and
HCT116-BubR1KD cells were treated with
nocodazole for 12 h and released into the
cell cycle (top ). Cells were harvested at the
indicated times for immunoblotting with
anti-BubR1, anti-p53 (DO-1 ), antiphospho-p53 at Ser15, Ser15, or Ser46, and
anti-actin antibodies (lanes 1–18 ). HCT116
and HCT116-BubR1KD cells were treated
with nocodazole for 12 h, treated with
cycloheximide, and then released into the
cell cycle (bottom ). Cells were
harvested at the indicated times for
immunoblotting with anti-BubR1, anti-p53
(DO-1 ), anti–phospho-p53 at Ser9, Ser15,
or Ser46, and anti-actin antibodies
(lanes 19–36 ). D, HCT116 cells were
transfected with the control pSuper (pS) or

vectors and cultured for 18 h. Transfected
cells were infected with rAd-LacZ or

units/mL, as described previously (20).
After incubation for an additional 36 h, the
cells were harvested and processed for
immunoblotting with anti-BubR1, anti-p53
(DO-1 ), and anti-actin antibodies.

phosphorylated GST-p53 but not GST alone (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4).
Similarly, when lysates from nocodazole-treated HCT116 cells
expressing HA-tagged wild-type BubR1 (HA-BubR1WT), HABubR1(1–525), or HA-BubR1(526–1050) were immunoprecipitated
with an anti-HA antibody and further incubated with GST-p53,
immunoprecipitated BubR1WT phosphorylated GST-p53, whereas
BubR1(1–525) and BubR1(526–1050) did not (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–7, top).
Next, we examined whether the spindle damage–induced
phosphorylations of p53 at Ser15 and Ser46 were mediated by
BubR1. In nocodazole-treated HeLa cell extracts subjected to
immunoprecipitation with anti-BubR1 antibodies or normal IgG
(control) followed by incubation of the immunocomplexes with
GST-p53 or GST alone and unlabeled ATP, the BubR1 immunocomplexes showed a strong signal with antibodies against p53
phosphorylated at Ser15 and Ser46, but not Ser20 (Fig. 3C),
indicating that BubR1 was capable of phosphorylating p53
in vitro. Furthermore, we compared the phosphorylation of p53
by BubR1 at different stages of the cell cycle. HeLa cells
synchronized by either thymidine-double block/postrelease (Thy-

DB, G2 phase), nocodazole treatment (NR0, M phase) or nocodazole treatment/postrelease (NR5, exit of mitosis) were immunoprecipitated with anti-BubR1 antibodies or preimmune IgG
(negative control). The resulting BubR1 immunocomplexes were
incubated with [g32P]ATP and purified GST-p53 fusion proteins
(Fig. 3D, lanes 1–6). Phosphorylation of the GST-p53 proteins by the
BubR1 immunocomplexes was detected in samples from all three
types of cell lysates, with higher levels clearly present in lysates
prepared from nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 3D, compare lanes 4
and 5 and lane 6). Furthermore, phosphorylation analysis using
BubR1 immunoprecipitated from nocodazole-synchronized and
postrelease cells at different time intervals revealed that the levels
of radiolabeled GST-p53 protein gradually decreased as cells
advanced from mitotic arrest to interphase (Fig. 3D, compare
lanes 10 and 11 and lane 12 ), indicating that increased
phosphorylation of p53 by BubR1 is likely to be a consequence of
the increased interaction of p53 and BubR1 during mitosis. To
further show that the phosphorylation of p53 requires active
BubR1, we introduced point substitutions in the lysine and

phenylalanine residues in the catalytic kinase domain of BubR1
potentially essential for phosphorylation reactions (K795R and
F1022S, respectively), and expressed these mutants from a Myctagged mammalian expression construct. The mutant BubR1
proteins showed significantly reduced autophosphorylation and
kinase activities (refs. 14, 20; data not shown). We then transfected
cells with the K795R, F1022S, or wild-type Myc-tagged BubR1
constructs, along with constructs encoding amino acids 1 to 525
and 526 to 1050 as negative controls (Fig. 3D, lanes 13–18).
Importantly, the K795R and F1022S point substitutions in BubR1

significantly reduced the phosphorylation of p53 compared with
that by BubR1WT, strongly suggesting that the activity of BubR1
kinase is important for the phosphorylation of p53.
BubR1 regulates the stability of p53 via phosphorylation.
We tested the effect of BubR1 on the stability and activity of p53
by transfecting HeLa cells with siRNA against BubR1 or luciferase
(negative control). Interestingly, cells transfected with the BubR1
siRNA (which substantially depleted BubR1 protein levels) contained markedly lower levels of p53 (Fig. 4A). Next, we generated
stable BubR1 knock-down (BubR1KD) cells by transfecting HCT116

cells with siRNA against BubR1. The expression of BubR1 in these
cells was f70% lower than that in control cells (Fig. 4B). We then
compared p53 levels between HCT116 parental and HCT116BubR1KD cells by treating cells with nocodazole for 12 h (which
induced p53 phosphorylation) and then releasing them into the
cell cycle (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–18). At the indicated time points, cells
were harvested and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for
p53 phosphorylated at Ser9 (negative control), Ser15, and Ser46.
Interestingly, whereas phosphorylation was markedly evident at
residues Ser15 and Ser46 in the parental HCT116 cells, the
corresponding levels were very low in HCT116-BubR1KD cells
(Fig. 4C, lanes 1–18). To further examine the stability of p53, we
released HCT116 parental and HCT116-BubR1KD cells from
nocodazole, exposed the cells to the protein translation inhibitor,
cycloheximide, and then monitored the levels of p53 phosphorylation over time by immunoblotting and subsequent image
analysis (Fig. 4C, lanes 19–36). Exposure to cycloheximide for
60 min decreased the levels of p53 phosphorylation at residues
Ser15 and Ser46 by almost 80% in HCT116-BubR1KD cells, whereas
steady state levels were observed in parental cells. Moreover, the
level of phosphorylation at p53 residue Ser15 in HCT116-BubR1KD
cells at 60 min posttreatment was similar to that in parental
HCT116 cells at 180 min posttreatment. At 120 min posttreatment,
HCT116-BubR1KD cells showed almost no detectable phosphorylation at residues Ser15 and Ser46, whereas both phospho-p53
proteins were stably detected in parental cells. These results were
confirmed by examining two additional independent BubR1KD
clones (data not shown). Together, these data strongly suggest that
BubR1 regulates the stability of p53 via phosphorylation. Finally, to
investigate whether p53 destabilization by targeted inhibition of
BubR1 expression could be compromised by the introduction of
exogenous BubR1 protein, we transfected HCT116 cells with
control pSuper or the pSuper-BubR1 siRNA plasmid and further
infected the cells with a recombinant adenovirus expressing LacZ
(rAd-LacZ; control) or wild-type BubR1 (rAd-BubR1; Fig. 4D). We
found that infection of rAd-BubR1 significantly restored p53 levels
in BubR1 siRNA-transfected HCT116 cells, whereas infection with
the control rAd-LacZ did not. In addition, immunofluorescence
analyses at the single cell level confirmed that significantly less p53
was present in BubR1 knock-down cells compared with BubR1competent parental cells (Supplemental Fig. S2). To rule out the
possibility that the reduced levels of BubR1 expression in the
knock-down cells was unrelated to BubR1-mediated checkpoint
signaling, we treated HCT116 parental and HCT116-BubR1KD cells
with nocodazole, and harvested the cells at various time points for
flow cytometry (Fig. 5A). Consistent with previous reports (14, 20),
the frequency of aneuploid/polyploid cells was dramatically higher
in BubR1KD cells than in BubR1-competent control cells, indicating
that the levels of BubR1 protein in the knock-down cells seemed to
correlate with decreased BubR1-mediated mitotic checkpoint
function. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that BubR1
regulates the protein stability of p53.
Inhibition of BubR1 expression accelerates chromosomal
instability and polyploidy in p53-null cells. It is generally
believed that a partial loss of checkpoint function was not
inherently lethal, and that chromosome missegregation during
mitosis causes chromosome damage and other mitotic defects.
Thus, as our established BubR1 knock-down cells showed f70%
BubR1 expression compared with parental cells, they could be
considered to reflect a partial inactivation of the mitotic
checkpoint. It is also believed that more than half of the human

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

cancers show alterations in the expression and/or sequence of the
p53 gene. Therefore, to investigate the effect of BubR1 depletion
on the frequency of polyploidy in p53-null cells, we developed
BubR1/p53 double knock-down/knock-out cells (HCT116-p53KO/
BubR1KD), using our BubR1KD cells and p53-null cells (HCT116p53KO). Initially, we synchronized HCT116, HCT116-p53KO, and
HCT116-BubR1KD cells using nocodazole and then subjected
them to flow cytometric analysis. Consistent with previous
reports (1, 3–7), HCT116-p53KO cells subjected to mitotic spindle
damage showed increased polyploid cell populations (8N) and
decreased apoptotic cell death, whereas parental cells avoided
polyploidy by exiting mitotic arrest and undergoing apoptosis
(Fig. 5A). These phenotypes are very similar to those seen in
HCT116-BubR1KD cells (Fig. 5A). Next, HCT116, HCT116-p53KO,
HCT116-BubR1KD, and HCT116-p53KO/BubR1KD cells were exposed to a reduced concentration of nocodazole that was
sufficient to arrest cells in mitosis but was insufficient to induce
widespread polyploidy or apoptosis (Fig. 5B). Our results revealed
that nocodazole-treated parental cells accumulated primarily in
the mitotic phase (4N), with relatively small proportions of
apoptotic and polyploid cells observed in these samples. Under
the conditions used, HCT116-p53KO and HCT116-BubR1KD cells
also accumulated in the mitotic phase; apoptosis was significantly less prevalent in p53-null cells compared with parental
cells, whereas polyploidy was slightly but significantly more
prevalent in BubR1-depleted cells compared with parental cells.
Interestingly, HCT116-p53KO/BubR1KD cells showed a dramatic
reduction in the mitotic cell population and a marked increase in
the polyploid cell population relative to HCT116-p53KO and
HCT116-BubR1KD cells. Moreover, the prevalence of polyploidy in
HCT116-p53KO/BubR1KD cells (f60%) was much higher than that
seen in HCT116-p53KO (f5%) or HCT116-BubR1KD (f20%) cells
after 60 to 72 h of nocodazole treatment. Thus, under conditions
of prolonged mitotic arrest due to treatment with a microtubule
inhibitor, coinhibition of BubR1 and p53 induced marked
chromosomal instability and polyploidy.
To examine the effect of BubR1 and p53 knock-down/knock-out
on the normal timing of mitotic progression, HCT116, HCT116p53KO, HCT116-BubR1KD, and HCT116-p53KO/BubR1KD cells were
synchronized at the boundary between the G1 and S phases, using a
double thymidine block. Following release from the G1 or S phases in
the absence of microtubule inhibitors, cells were harvested at
various time points and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in
Fig. 6A, in the presence of a functional spindle, cells depleted of both
BubR1 and p53 (HCT116-p53KO/BubR1KD) did not differ significantly from p53-null cells (HCT116-p53KO) in terms of progression
through the S and G2 phases, mitosis, or exit from mitosis. Next,
we examined the effect of BubR1 and/or p53 inhibition on mitotic
cell cycle progression at the single cell level, using time-lapse
photomicroscopy of HCT116, HCT116-p53KO, HCT116-BubR1KD,
and HCT116-p53KO/BubR1KD cells transfected with an expression
plasmid encoding an H2B-GFP fusion protein for the visualization of
chromosomes. As each cell entered mitosis, nuclear envelop
breakdown was set as time zero, and the relative times for the
individual cell types to complete chromosome separation were
determined (Fig. 6B and C). In HCT116-p53KO cells, the time to
completion of chromosome separation was 54.4 (F6.3) min, which
was very similar to that of control HCT116 cells, 53.7 (F7.9) min. In
contrast, HCT116-BubR1KD cells showed a significantly faster exit
from the mitotic cell cycle, at 41.5 (F4.6) min. However, further
inhibition of BubR1 in p53-null cells (HCT116-p53KO/BubR1KD) did

Functional Interaction between BubR1 and p53

not seem to additionally retard or accelerate the duration of mitosis
in the presence of a functional spindle.
In summary, our results indicate that BubR1 interacts with,
phosphorylates, and stabilizes p53, and further provide evidence
that p53 activation induced by mitotic spindle damage is a
response to BubR1-mediated signaling.

Discussion
Normal cells harboring competent BubR1 and p53 proteins
undergo prolonged mitosis arrest in response to spindle damage,
and then subsequently exit mitosis and undergo apoptosis. Defects
in BubR1 not only augment the development of aneuploidy, but
also compromise spindle damage–induced apoptotic cell death.
Similarly, p53-deficient cells do not undergo apoptosis, instead
proceeding to aneuploidy. Although a recent study showed that
prolonged mitotic arrest triggered by microtubule disruption could
stabilize p53 by phosphorylation, in a pattern distinct from that
seen in response to DNA damage (13), the molecular mechanisms
underlying this effect are unknown. Additionally, although it is
known that numerous kinases regulate the phosphorylation of p53,
and the phosphorylation status of p53 is known to affect its
stability, sequence-specific DNA binding and protein interaction
affinity with target proteins, the mechanism by which these kinases
trigger phosphorylation of p53 during mitosis are unknown. In this
work, we found that the BubR1 mitotic checkpoint kinase interacts
with p53 and contributes to p53 stabilization via phosphorylation.
Silencing of BubR1 expression reduces this phosphorylation and
consequently decreases the stability of p53, and this effect can be
recovered by the introduction of exogenous BubR1 protein. These
results collectively indicate that the p53 response to mitotic spindle
damage is probably dependent on BubR1-mediated signaling, and
that a functional cross-talk exists between BubR1 and p53 at the
potential level of postmitotic regulation.
BubR1 protein and phosphorylation levels are higher in cells
subjected to mitotic spindle damage compared with cells
undergoing normal mitotic progression (14). Because BubR1 in
unattached kinetochores exhibits a higher degree of phosphorylation than its soluble counterpart (22), we hypothesized that BubR1
hyperphosphorylation might contribute to stabilizing and/or
activating p53 via phosphorylation. Interestingly, two kinaseinsufficient mutants of BubR1 (BubR1K795R and F1022S) yielded
significantly reduced levels of p53 phosphorylation. Moreover,
BubR1-mediated phosphorylation of p53 was also reduced in cells
exiting from mitosis following recovery from spindle damage.
These observations strongly support our notion that the induction
of p53 following mitotic checkpoint activation requires signaling
via BubR1-mediated phosphorylation. Furthermore, the functional
cross-talk between BubR1 and p53 is likely to be an important
factor in the determination of subsequent postmitotic consequences, such as adaptation or apoptosis.
Two mitotic kinases, Aurora-A and polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1),
regulate the mitotic cell cycle by controlling chromosome
segregation, spindle assembly, and commitment to mitosis
(23, 24). Aurora-A and Plk1 physically bind to and phosphorylate
p53 (25, 26). Interestingly, whereas mitotic spindle damage induces
phosphorylation and activation of p53, the phosphorylation events
induced by Aurora-A and Plk1 actually reduce the activity of p53.
Moreover, because Aurora-A and Plk1 are overexpressed in many
human cancer cells (27–29), whereas BubR1 tends to be downregulated in cancer cells (20), it is possible that BubR1 antagonizes

www.aacrjournals.org

the inhibitory effects of Aurora-A or Plk1 on p53. Although it is
likely that p53 is also phosphorylated and activated by additional
kinases that are induced by mitotic spindle damage, our present
results suggest that p53 activation in response to mitotic spindle
damage requires signaling via BubR1-mediated phosphorylation.
Because p53 degradation predominantly involves MDM2-mediated ubiquitination (30), we tested whether the stability of p53 was
regulated by a mitotic spindle damage–induced functional
interaction between BubR1 and MDM2. We transfected HeLa cells
with siRNA targeting BubR1 and examined the levels of MDM2. In
contrast to the dramatic p53 decrease observed after BubR1 siRNA
knock-down, we did not observe any significant change in the
MDM2 levels of these cells (Supplemental Fig. S3A). Furthermore,
no significant interaction between BubR1 and MDM2 was detected
in mammalian two-hybrid (Supplemental Fig. S3B) and immunoprecipitation (data not shown) experiments under conditions that
yielded reproducible interactions between these two proteins in
our experimental system. These results indicate that the destabilization of p53 observed in BubR1-depleted cells was independent
of the MDM2-mediated ubiquitination pathway (Supplemental
Fig. S3 and S4). However, in interphase cells, BubR1 could
theoretically stabilize p53 by outcompeting its negative regulator,
MDM2, because the BubR1-binding domain of p53 overlaps with
the MDM2-binding domain (Fig. 1D). In addition, it is theoretically
possible that BubR1 might transcriptionally and/or translationally
regulate p53 expression. Importantly, this study showed that total
p53 and p53 phosphorylated at Ser15 and Ser46 all accumulated
to high levels in parental cells following mitotic spindle damage
(Fig. 4C), and then gradually decreased as the cells progressed
through the cell cycle to interphase. In addition, our kinase
analyses revealed that kinase-insufficient BubR1 mutants were
associated with significantly reduced phosphorylation of p53
(Fig. 2D), and BubR1-mediated phosphorylation of p53 was
reduced in interphase cells or cells exiting from mitosis following
spindle damage (Fig. 2D). Together, these findings strongly suggest
that the effects of BubR1 on p53 exogenously expressed in mitotic
cells was likely due to posttranslational modification of p53 rather
than transcriptional control in the transcriptionally inactive
mitotic cells.
Our additional investigation into the effect of BubR1 depletion
on the frequency of polyploidy in p53-null cells in response to
spindle damage revealed that cells depleted of both BubR1 and
p53 showed significantly more aneuploidy/polyploidy than p53null cells and BubR1-depleted cells (Fig. 5A and B). However, in
the presence of a functional spindle, cells depleted of both BubR1
and p53 showed no significant differences from p53-null cells in
terms of progression through the S and G2 phases, mitosis, or exit
from mitosis (Fig. 5). These findings imply that BubR1 knockdown in p53-null cells augments the chromosomal instability and
polyploidy induced by spindle damage. We recently reported that
the sustained inactivation and/or down-regulation of BubR1
prevented the induction of apoptosis that normally follows
postmitotic adaptation (20). Therefore, the findings of the present
study provide evidence that p53 induction by mitotic checkpoint
activation is a component of the BubR1-mediated checkpoint
signaling pathway.
Taken together, our results strongly suggest that BubR1 interacts
with and phosphorylates p53, thus contributing to the stabilization
of p53. This functional cross-talk between BubR1 and p53 may
represent a new molecular insight into how p53 is activated in
response to spindle damage.
