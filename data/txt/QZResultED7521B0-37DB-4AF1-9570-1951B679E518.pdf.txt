Abstract
Recent ﬁndings show that exposure to temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA-damaging drug used to treat glioblastoma
(GBM), can suppress the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. To understand the mechanistic basis for this effect and
its potential utility as a TMZ response biomarker, we compared the response of isogenic GBM cell populations
differing only in expression of the DNA repair protein methyltransferase (MGMT), a TMZ-sensitivity determinant,
after exposure to TMZ in vitro and in vivo. Hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]-pyruvate–based MRI was used to monitor
temporal effects on pyruvate metabolism in parallel with DNA-damage responses and tumor cell growth. TMZ
exposure decreased conversion of pyruvate to lactate only in MGMT-deﬁcient cells. This effect coincided
temporally with TMZ-induced increases in levels of the DNA-damage response protein pChk1. Changes in
pyruvate to lactate conversion triggered by TMZ preceded tumor growth suppression and were not associated
with changes in levels of NADH or lactate dehydrogenase activity in tumors. Instead, they were associated with a
TMZ-induced decrease in the expression and activity of pyruvate kinase PKM2, a glycolytic enzyme that indirectly
controls pyruvate metabolism. PKM2 silencing decreased PK activity, intracellular lactate levels, and conversion
of pyruvate to lactate in the same manner as TMZ, and Chk1 silencing blocked the TMZ-induced decrease in
PKM2 expression. Overall, our ﬁndings showed how TMZ-induced DNA damage is linked through PKM2 to
changes in pyruvate metabolism, and how these changes can be exploited by MRI methods as an early sensor of
TMZ therapeutic response. Cancer Res; 74(23); 7115–24. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapeutic DNA–methylating agent useful in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM;
refs. 1, 2). DNA O6-methylguanine (O6MG) lesions created by
drug exposure mispair with thymine in the ﬁrst cycle of DNA
replication, leading to activation of the DNA mismatch repair

system (3–5). The removal of the thymine opposite O6MG and
subsequent reinsertion following repair resynthesis leads to
cycles of futile mismatch repair. This in turn ultimately leads to
DNA single-strand breaks (SSB), activation of sensors of DNA
damage, the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB),
and delayed cell death by a combination of senescence and
mitotic catastrophe (6–10). Because of its limited side effects
and proven efﬁcacy, TMZ is a component of the standard
therapy for a variety of human brain tumors, and is frequently
combined with other experimental agents (2).
Despite its ability to prolong disease-free survival, the
response to TMZ-based therapies has proven difﬁcult to monitor in patients. At present, standard imaging techniques are
used to monitor the size of contrast-enhancing tumor following
initiation of therapy, although for reasons related to difﬁculties
in distinguishing tumor from necrosis and scarring, this
approach often proves suboptimal (11, 12). Given that many
patients, especially those with low-grade gliomas, can remain
on TMZ for long periods of time (13), a more effective way to
monitor drug efﬁcacy and the early stages of drug failure in realtime would allow for better patient stratiﬁcation as well as for
the initiation of alternate approaches in cases of drug failure.
It has been known for more than 50 years that tumors
metabolically differ from normal cells (14), an observation
that has recently been applied to the noninvasive study of
tumors by carbon-13 (13C) metabolic imaging. Tumors

frequently have high levels of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA; which preferentially converts pyruvate to lactate) and
NADH, the cofactor required for LDH-A activity, both of
which may explain the high levels of lactate found in many
tumors (15, 16). Changes in the expression of several other
tumor-speciﬁc metabolic enzymes have also been noted,
however, including a shift in expression from pyruvate
kinase (PK) M1 (which complexes with multiple glycolytic
enzymes and facilitates the shunting of pyruvate into the
citric acid cycle) to the less active M2 form of the enzyme,
which also may contribute to increased pyruvate to lactate
conversion (17–19). On the basis of these observations, the
administration of hyperpolarized compounds, most typically pyruvate, to tumor-bearing subjects, followed by the
real-time monitoring of conversion of the substrate to various labeled metabolites using 13C 3D magnetic resonance
spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) should allow for the localization of malignant tissue (20). Studies along these lines
have proven promising, and further work suggested that the
approach could also be used to study drug response because
cells undergoing growth arrest or apoptosis convert less
hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate (21–24). More recently,
the increased conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate to
lactate was shown to precede the onset of tumor growth, and
also was reversed before tumor regression, at least in a mycdriven murine model of liver cancer (25). These studies suggest
that hyperpolarized 13C MRSI may be a promising way to
monitor tumor growth and perhaps tumor drug response.
We previously used hyperpolarized 13C MRSI monitoring
to show that human GBM xenografts exhibit an increase in
hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate conversion relative to
normal brain (26, 27), and that TMZ exposure decreased this
conversion in a time frame that preceded histologic and
radiographic response (28). Although these ﬁndings suggested that pyruvate metabolism might be linked to TMZ
response and could serve as a biomarker of TMZ action, it
was not clear whether the metabolic response was unique to
drug-sensitive cells, nor was the basis for the metabolic
change apparent. To better address these issues, we generated two pairs of isogenic GBM cells that differ only in
expression of O6MG DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), the
protein that removes TMZ-induced O6MG lesions before
they can mispair and lead to DNA damage, and as such
serves as the primary determinant of TMZ sensitivity (29–
31). Using these cells, we show that the TMZ-induced
suppression of the conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate
to lactate is uniquely linked to the TMZ-induced DNAdamage response via decreased PKM2 expression and intracellular lactate levels, and as such serves as an early monitor
of TMZ response in brain tumor cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
U87MG human GBM cells, and the same cells expressing
MGMT P140K (U87 þ MGMT), or shRNAs targeting PKM2
(U87 þ shRNA PKM2) were obtained and cultured as described previously (31, 32). Suppression of Chk1 protein (>80%)

by transfection of siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was
veriﬁed by Western blotting. G55 is a human GBM cell line
passaged through nude mice and reestablished as a stable
xenograft (33), and was provided by the UCSF Brain Tumor
Research Center. The G55 cells form invasive intracranial
tumors in rodents that are more characteristic of primary
human GBM (33). The identity of both cell lines was veriﬁed
by DNA ﬁngerprinting (Promega Powerplex 16) before initiation of the studies.
Intracerebral tumor implantation and imaging study
scheme
Tumor cells were implanted intracerebrally into male
athymic rats (median weight 280 g) as described previously
(26–28). Animals received either oral vehicle (Ora-Plus; Paddock Laboratories), oral TMZ (100 mg/kg), intraperitoneal O6
-benzylguanine (BG, 50 mg/kg), or BG followed 2 hours later
by TMZ when the tumor as monitored by T2-weighted axial
images was at least the size of one spectroscopic voxel
(approximately 86 mm3, typically 9–15 days after tumor cell
implantation). All animals underwent 13C and 1H imaging
before treatment (D0, baseline), and 1 (D1) and/or 2 (D2)
days following treatment.
Polarization procedure and 1H and 13C MR imaging
The polarization procedure and in vivo imaging have been
described previously (17, 24, 25, 27, 34–36). In brief, 13C imaging
data were acquired using a compressed sensing or fully sampled 13C 3D MRSI sequence (24, 25) at 20 seconds from the start
of the injection of approximately 2.5 mL hyperpolarized
[1-13C]-pyruvate through the tail vein. The compressed sensing
data were acquired over 18 seconds, and the fully sampled data
over 17 seconds. The injection started approximately 10 seconds after dissolution and lasted 10 seconds. For tumor volume
evaluation, T1-weighted anatomical images were obtained in
the axial plane after the injection of 0.1 mL Gadolinium (Gd)DTPA (approximately 0.2 mmol/kg; ref. 27).
Data analysis
The methods for processing 13C MRSI data have been
described previously (27, 36, 37). The 3D volume of the contrast-enhancing lesion was calculated from the axial T1 postGd slices as described previously (36). At each time point a
percentage of tumor volume change from baseline was calculated, with the last time point being a composite of values
derived from multiple paired animals at the termination of the
experiment 3 to 7 days after TMZ exposure.
Immunohistochemistry
At D1 or D2 after drug treatment, animals were anesthetized
(1%–2% isoﬂurane) and perfused with 10% neutral-buffered
formalin (40 mL). The brains were then removed, ﬁxed in
phosphate-buffered 10% formalin, dehydrated by graded ethanols, and embedded in Paraplast Plus wax (McCormick Scientiﬁc). Tissue sections were incubated with rabbit monoclonal phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) or polyclonal cleaved caspase-3
(Asp175) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) with antigen
retrieval. All immunohistochemistry assays were performed on

the Benchmark XT (Ventana Medical Systems) using the
UltraView detection system.
Perfused cell studies
Approximately 3  107 U87 or U87 þ shRNA PKM2 cells
were grown on Biosilon microcarrier beads (Nunc) for 48
hours, then loaded and analyzed in a 10 mm NMR tube
connected to an NMR-compatible perfusion system, as previously described (23, 38).
Protein extraction and immunoblot analyses
Whole-cell lysates (30 mg protein) were subjected to
Western blot analysis using antibodies against Chk1, MGMT,
PKM2, and b-actin (all Cell Signaling Technology; ref. 32) with
detection by a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech).
LDH activity and NADH assays
LDH activity and NADH levels were assessed from the D2
resected brains of control and TMZ-treated U87 tumor-bearing
rats. Brains were rapidly removed after euthanasia, immediately snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at 80 C. For LDH
activity, Km and Vmax values were determined by ﬁtting initial
rates of NADH consumption (absorbance at 340 nm) and
pyruvate concentrations to a Lineweaver–Burke plot (39).
Levels of NADH were determined in tumor extracts using a
spectrophotometric enzymatic cycling assay kits (BioVision)
according to the manufacturer's instructions (40). In brief,
tumor tissue was homogenized, centrifuged (14,000  g, 5 minutes) and heated (60 C, 30 minutes) to selectively decompose
NADþ in the supernatant. The samples were then diluted 1:10
to fall in the linear range for a standard curve, and mixed with
NADH reaction buffer. After 15 minutes of incubation at room
temperature, changes in absorbance at 450 nm caused by the
reduction of the reporter molecule thiazolyl blue were measured on a M200 Tecan spectrophotometer (Tecan Group) and
compared with a standard curve established using known
NADH concentration.
PK activity and intracellular pyruvate and lactate
measurement assay
Intracellular PK activity, as well as concentrations of pyruvate and lactate were measured using PK activity, pyruvate, or
lactate assay kits, respectively (BioVision).

Results
In vivo biochemical and metabolic response of MGMTmodiﬁed GBM cells to TMZ
To ﬁrst determine whether TMZ-induced changes in pyruvate metabolism were related to drug response, two pairs of
isogenic cells differing only in MGMT expression were used.
TMZ-sensitive, MGMT-deﬁcient GBM cells (U87 cells and G55
cells preincubated with the selective MGMT-depleting agent
BG; ref. 41) exhibit increased levels of DNA SSB within 1 day of
an IC50 TMZ exposure, accompanied by increased levels of the

www.aacrjournals.org

DNA-damage response protein pChk1, and the appearance of
DNA DSB beginning 2 days after TMZ exposure (31). Isogenic
TMZ-resistant, MGMT-proﬁcient GBM cells (U87 cells expressing a construct encoding MGMT, and G55 cells) in contrast,
exhibit no increase in DNA SSB, pChk1, or DSB at 1 or 2 days
following TMZ exposure (31).
In the ﬁrst set of studies, control and MGMT-modiﬁed U87
GBM cells were intracranially implanted into rats and allowed
to form tumors. Animals were then treated with vehicle or
TMZ (100 mg/kg) and 24 or 48 hours later were administered
[1-13C]-pyruvate and monitored for conversion of the substrate
to lactate by 13C MRSI, for markers of the DNA-damage
response, and for tumor growth. Nondrug-treated cells (U87
vehicle and U87 þ MGMT vehicle) as well as the TMZ-resistant
drug-treated U87 þ MGMT þ TMZ cells (31) exhibited an
increase in pyruvate to lactate conversion both 1 and 2 days
after TMZ treatment (Fig. 1A). The TMZ-sensitive drug-treated
U87 cells (U87 þ TMZ), however, exhibited decreased conversion of pyruvate to lactate (compared with pretreatment D0
tumors) beginning 1 day after TMZ exposure (Fig. 1A). The
effect of TMZ on pyruvate to lactate conversion in these cells
was consistent temporally with the appearance of cells that
stained positively for activated pChk1 (Fig. 1B), but preceded
the effect of the drug on tumor growth, which was not apparent
1 to 2 days after TMZ exposure in any cell group, but was
apparent in the U87 þ TMZ cells at the termination of the
experiment 3 to 7 days after TMZ exposure (Fig. 1C; ref. 28).
These results suggested that TMZ-induced changes in pyruvate to lactate conversion were related to the formation and/or
response to TMZ-induced O6MG, and TMZ response.
To verify and expand on these results, MGMT-proﬁcient,
TMZ-resistant G55 GBM cells were intracranially implanted
into rats, allowed to form tumors, treated with vehicle, the
selective MGMT-depleting agent BG, TMZ only, or BG þ TMZ,
and similarly examined for effects on drug action and metabolic response. As with the tumors generated from the intracranially implanted U87 series of cells, nondrug-treated G55
cells (G55 þ vehicle) as well as the G55 cells incubated with BG
(G55 þ BG) or TMZ alone (G55 þ TMZ; ref. 31) exhibited an
increase in pyruvate to lactate conversion both 1 and 2 days
after TMZ treatment (Fig. 2A). The BG-treated, MGMT-depleted G55 cells (G55 þ BG þ TMZ), however, when exposed to
TMZ, exhibited a decreased conversion of pyruvate to lactate
(compared with pretreatment D0 tumors) beginning 1 day
after TMZ exposure (Fig. 2A). The effect of TMZ on pyruvate to
lactate conversion in these cells appeared coincident with the
appearance of pChk1 staining at 1 day after TMZ exposure in
the TMZ-sensitive G55 þ BG tumors (Fig. 2B), but preceded the
effect of the drug on tumor growth, which, consistent with the
mechanism of action of the drug, was not apparent 1 to 2 days
after TMZ exposure in any group (Fig. 2C), but was apparent in
the G55 þ BG þ TMZ tumors, which at the termination of the
experiment 3 to 7 days after TMZ exposure were 43% smaller
than at 2 days, as opposed to G55 þ TMZ tumors, which nearly
doubled in size over the same time period. These results show
that the effect of TMZ on pyruvate metabolism is directly
related to the absence of MGMT, the generation of O6MGrelated DNA damage, and/or the cellular response to these

lesions, all of which occur before the onset of TMZ-induced
growth arrest and cell death.
The TMZ-induced metabolic response is not linked to
inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, changes
in NADH levels, or changes in LDH activity
Reductions in the conversion of 13C pyruvate to 13C lactate
in in vivo imaging studies of drug-treated tumors have been
ascribed to a variety of factors, including loss of cellularity,
apoptosis-induced PARP activation and depletion of NADH
levels, decreased LDH-A expression, and loss of LDH activity.
In the present study, the decrease in conversion of pyruvate
to lactate in response to TMZ occurred within 1 day of TMZ
exposure in vivo, long before any changes were noted in
tumor growth and long before TMZ-induced O6MG lesions
are converted to DNA mismatches and DNA DSB in these
cells (31). Similarly, the effects of TMZ on pyruvate to lactate
conversion were noted in drug-sensitive cells in the absence
of any effect on apoptosis because control and TMZ-treated
U87 tumors exhibited equally low levels of caspase-3 staining
2 days after TMZ exposure (Fig. 3A), consistent with the
reported inability of these cells to undergo apoptosis in
response to TMZ (6). Similarly, although TMZ-sensitive
GBM cells could be expected to activate PARP following
TMZ exposure in response to TMZ-induced DNA strand

breaks (42), no changes in the levels of NADH (Fig. 3B) or
LDH activity (Fig. 3C) were noted in U87 tumors 2 days after
TMZ exposure as both the LDH Km and Vmax were not
signiﬁcantly different between control and TMZ-treated U87
tumor cells at the time (2 days after TMZ) at which significant differences in pyruvate to lactate conversion were
noted (Fig. 1A). These results show that the TMZ-induced
changes in pyruvate to lactate that are unique to TMZsensitive cells occur before the onset of growth arrest or cell
death, and whereas related to TMZ-induced DNA damage
and the damage response, appear unrelated to NADH levels
and changes in LDH activity.
TMZ alters PKM2 expression and PK activity in a way
that contributes to changes in pyruvate metabolism
PKM2 is overexpressed in GBM (32) and in its tetrameric
active conformation physically associates with other glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenases, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) that
are part of the complex that controls the conversion of
glucose to pyruvate and the ultimate fate of pyruvate. PKM2
has also been shown to be downregulated in cells exhibiting alterations in pyruvate to lactate conversion (25), suggesting that its regulation may contribute to the TMZinduced changes in pyruvate metabolism noted in this

conversion in the same cells in vivo (Figs. 1A and 2A). These
results suggest that the DNA-directed effects of TMZ on
PKM expression may drive alterations in metabolism. To
address this possibility more fully, we used two different
shRNAs to suppress PKM2 expression in U87 cells and then
monitored the effects on pyruvate metabolism. As shown
in Fig. 4C, shRNA-mediated suppression of PKM2 expression
resulted in a decrease in PK activity similar to that noted
following TMZ exposure, as well as decreases in steady-state
levels of both pyruvate and lactate in U87 and G55 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3; ref. 32). More importantly, the TMZsensitive U87 cells in which PKM2 levels and PK activity
were suppressed also exhibited the same signiﬁcant decrease in the in vitro conversion of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate to lactate (63.5%  4.4% of U87 control, Student

treated U87 cells. Similarly, in vitro levels of intracellular
pyruvate and lactate were also signiﬁcantly reduced in
TMZ-treated U87 cells, and TMZ þ BG-treated, MGMTdepleted G55 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results
suggest that the DNA-directed actions of TMZ lead to an
early suppression of PK expression, PK activity, and intracellular lactate levels. The decreased intracellular lactate
levels in turn are associated with, and may be responsible
for (21), the decreased conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate noted in TMZ-treated tumors.
pChk1 contributes to the link between TMZ-induced
DNA damage and PKM2 expression/activity
Because TMZ-induced changes in PKM2 expression and
pyruvate metabolism were noted within 1 day of TMZ exposure in MGMT-deﬁcient cells, we considered the possibility

that the DNA-damage response was linked to these metabolism-related changes. Furthermore, because the onset of
Chk1 activation in drug-treated, TMZ-sensitive cells noted
here and in previous studies (31) temporally matched that of
the changes in metabolism, we examined the speciﬁc role of
Chk1 in controlling this phenomenon. To do so, U87 and
G55 cells were infected with siRNA constructs targeting
Chk1, after which effects on PKM2 expression and PK
activity were monitored. As shown in Fig. 5A, introduction
of either of two different Chk1 siRNAs reduced levels of
Chk1 by approximately 80% relative to scramble control
cells in both cell lines. Introduction of scramble siRNA into

U87 or G55 þ BG cells did not signiﬁcantly change PKM2
protein levels, whereas exposure of these cells to an IC50
concentration of TMZ signiﬁcantly decreased levels of
PKM2 (Fig. 5B and consistent with data in Fig. 4A). This

reduced by Chk1 suppression (last column vs. adjacent two

decreased PK activity, an effect that was also lessened by
Chk1 suppression (Fig. 5C). These studies show that the

contributes to the decreases in PKM2 expression, PK activity, and intracellular lactate levels linked to changes in
pyruvate metabolism.
TMZ-induced changes in PKM2 expression and
metabolism are a biomarker of response rather than a
contributor to TMZ action
Having shown that exposure of TMZ-sensitive, but not
TMZ-resistant cells led to decreases in PKM2 expression and
PK activity, and that these changes were sufﬁcient to alter
pyruvate metabolism, we also considered the possibility that
these events were critical downstream components of the
cytotoxic action of TMZ in addition to potential biomarkers
of TMZ action. To address this possibility, we measured the
cytotoxic potential of TMZ in drug-sensitive U87 cells and in
the same cells in which levels of PKM2 were either genetically suppressed or in which PK activity was increased by
virtue of overexpression of the highly active form of PK
(PKM1). As shown in Table 1, whereas the suppression of
PKM2 levels in TMZ-sensitive U87 cells that were shown to
alter pyruvate metabolism modestly decreased the colony
formation ability of the non TMZ-treated cells, it had no
effect on TMZ-induced cytotoxicity. Similarly, although
overexpression of PKM1 nearly doubled PK activity in
U87 cells (32), it also had no signiﬁcant effect on TMZinduced suppression of clonagenicity. These results therefore suggest that, although TMZ-induced changes in pyruvate metabolism are linked to changes in PKM2 expression,
PK activity, and ultimately TMZ-induced DNA adducts,
these changes, although separable from the cytotoxic
actions of the drug and not per se a contributor to the
effects of TMZ on tumor cell clonagenicity, are a marker of
TMZ activity (Fig. 5D).

Discussion

C MRSI is capable of monitoring the growth and regression of oncogene-driven tumors (22), and can provide biomarkers of the response of solid tumors to DNA-damaging
agents and radiation (21). Here, we show that 13C MRSI
measurements of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate conversion, via linkage to regulation of PKM expression and
DNA damage, may be useful in measuring the early response

7122

of glioma to the commonly used chemotherapeutic-methylating agent TMZ.
A variety of studies have used 13C MRSI to examine the
linkage between tumor growth, regression, drug response,
and pyruvate metabolism, with varying results. Rapid
changes in pyruvate metabolism were related to consumption of NADH and subsequent inhibition of LDH-A associated with apoptosis or necrotic cell death (21). Additional
studies in doxorubicin-treated breast adenocarcinomas,
however, showed that drug-induced suppression of pyruvate
to lactate conversion could be separated from the cell death
process, although the metabolic changes were still linked to
consumption of NADH and subsequent inhibition of LDH-A
associated with drug DNA damage and PARP activation (43).
In the present study, the metabolic effects linked to TMZ
sensitivity could be clearly separated from the cell death
process and in turn linked to DNA damage, although the
exact form of damage that triggers the change in metabolism
noted can only be partially determined. The requirement for
O6MG lesions, the timing of events, and the data from siRNA
suppression studies, however, suggest that Chk1 activation
may help link persistent DNA damage to the metabolic
changes noted, thus making Chk1 important in both reacting to DNA damage and in providing a noninvasively detectable signal of cellular response.
If O6MG-induced DNA damage and signaling lead to
changes in cellular metabolism, how is this accomplished?
The present studies suggest that PKM2, a key regulator of
cell metabolism known to be overexpressed in GBM may be
involved. TMZ-induced DNA damage and Chk1 activation
led to decreases in PKM2 levels and activity. Because PKM2
is regulated by a variety of events, including phosphorylation, PKM2 may be a target of Chk1 and as such directly
linked to the DNA-damage response (44–46). Alternatively,
the relatively large number of Chk1 substrates may activate
pathways that alter PKM2 localization as well as absolute
levels in a less direct manner. A number of other kinases,
including Chk2, are also activated by TMZ in the time frame
consistent with the TMZ-induced metabolic changes, and
this degree of redundancy may explain the only partial
reaquisition of PKM2 levels and activity following Chk1
knockdown in TMZ-treated cells. The TMZ-induced
decrease in PKM2 levels was in turn associated with
decreased levels of pyruvate and lactate at least where
measured in vitro. Given the previously described connection between reduced intracellular lactate levels and
decreased conversion of 13Cpyruvate to 13C lactate (21), it
seems reasonable that the TMZ-induced decreases in intracellular lactate levels noted here resulted in the decreased
pyruvate to lactate conversion in TMZ-treated animals.
Although direct proof of this linkage would require more
complex methods such as diffusion-weighted spectroscopy
to measure intracellular lactate levels in vivo (47, 48), the
present data clearly show that PKM2 plays a key role in
linking the DNA-damage response to monitorable changes
in pyruvate metabolism that in turn relate to drug efﬁcacy.
In addition to identifying the link between TMZ-induced
DNA damage and pyruvate metabolism, and deﬁning the

Pyruvate Metabolism as a Sensor of Temozolomide Response

mechanism by which this linkage occurs, the present study also
has clinical implications. Current monitoring of TMZ action
relies on inaccurate and uncertain measures of tumor size
gathered over long periods of time following drug exposure.
The studies presented show that at least in a preclinical model
of GBM, TMZ-induced changes in pyruvate metabolism can
provide a much earlier and perhaps more reliable marker of
tumor response. Detection of the TMZ-induced changes in
metabolism do not rely on measurements of tumor size or
contrast enhancement, and in fact appear to precede any druginduced changes in these parameters. As such this approach
may alleviate concerns about inaccuracies of tumor size measurements. In addition, TMZ-induced changes in metabolism
are related to the same event (DNA damage) that leads to cell
death, but do not appear to be part of the cell death process. As
a result, direct drug-sensitivity information, rather than information indirectly inferred from predictors of DNA damage
(such as MGMT promoter methylation; ref. 49), can be
obtained rapidly, repeatedly, and in the actual tumor being
treated within a day of drug exposure rather than days to weeks
later. Clinically, this could allow more rapid decision making
and could also limit the exposure of drug-insensitive tumors to
mutagens such as TMZ. The latter point could be especially
important in low-grade astrocytoma, which are frequently
treated with TMZ for extended periods of time, and that can
be driven to progression by TMZ-induced genetic alterations
(50). Therefore, although metabolic changes may be driven by
events directly linked to cell growth inhibition and cell death,
the unique delayed action of TMZ may provide links between

the DNA-damage response and cell metabolism that can be
exploited for improved therapy.
