ABSTRACT
The incidence and prognostic role of MYC and BCL2 rearrangements in mature B-cell
lymphomas have been extensively studied, except the infrequent mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL). Here, we analyzed the MYC and BCL2 abnormalities and other cytogenetic
aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 50 MCL patients with bone
marrow involvement. Eighteen patients (36.0%) had MYC gains and/or amplifications,
and twelve patients (24.0%) had BCL2 gains and/or amplifications. Among the 18
patients with MYC abnormality, four had simultaneous MYC translocations, but no BCL2
translocation was detected among patients with BCL2 abnormality. Only two patients
(4.0%) had both MYC and BCL2 abnormalities. The patients with a MYC abnormality
had a significantly higher tumor burden, a higher percentage of medium/high risk
MIPI group and genomic instability compared to those without this abnormality.
However, no significant difference was observed between patients with or without
a BCL2 abnormality in terms of clinical and cytogenetic factors. Patients with a MYC
abnormality had poorer progress-free survival (PFS) (9.0 vs. 48.0 months, p = .000)
and overall survival (OS) (12.0 vs. 94.5 months, p = .000), but the presence of a BCL2
abnormality did not significantly influence either PFS or OS. In multivariate analysis, the
MYC abnormality was the independent adverse factor for both PFS and OS, and intensive
chemotherapy did not improve the outcome of these patients. Thus, the presence of a
MYC but not BCL2 abnormality predicted the poor survival of MCL patients, and a new
treatment strategy should be developed for these patients.

with rituximab combined chemotherapy [2]. However,
other lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements
have received less attention. For example, no previous
study has systematically described the incidence and
evaluated the prognostic role of a double hit with MYC
and BCL2 rearrangements in mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL). In this study, we will describe the incidence of
MYC and BCL2 abnormalities detected by fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) and discuss the prognostic
role of cytogenetic aberrations in MCL.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, increasing attention has been given to
a subset of mature B-cell lymphomas with both MYC
and BCL2 rearrangements, which have been defined
as “double hit” lymphomas (DH lymphomas) because
of their aggressive clinical course and resistance to
conventional chemotherapy [1]. DH lymphoma accounts
for approximately 10% of diffuse large B cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) cases and has poor survival even when treated

exhibit a translocation with the IGH gene, as there was no
abnormal signal with the IGH/MYC dual fusion probes.
However, all of the BCL2 abnormalities were only gains
and/or amplifications, without a translocation signal with
the BCL2 dual color break apart probe or the IGH/BCL2
dual fusion translocation probe. Only 2 patients had a
MYC and BCL2 abnormality simultaneously, whereas
11 patients had both a MYC abnormality and a TP53
deletion. Because the gain and amplification always come
out concurrently in an individual, we did not discriminate
these two situations.
In order to validate the above results, we tested
MYC and BCL2 abnormalities in five MCL cell lines:
Z138, JVM-13, Granta-519, MAVER1, JEKO-1, which
were given kindly by professor John Chan in University
of Nebraska Medical Center. Two cell lines have MYC
amplification (MAVER1 and JEKO1); Two with MYC gain
(Granta519 and JVM-13) and Z-138 with translocation. In
aspect of BCL2, no translocation was observed and JVM13 had normal BCL2, while other four cell lines having
BCL2 amplification. These results are according with
above phenomenon that gain/amplification of MYC and/
or BCL2 are more frequent than translocation in MCL.
Then, we compared the clinical characteristics
and cytogenetic aberrations between patients with a
MYC or BCL2 abnormality and those who did not have
these abnormalities. As shown in Table 2, there was no
significant difference between patients with or without a
BCL2 abnormality in terms of clinical and cytogenetic
factors except for in the case of their total cytogenetic
aberrations. However, most of the clinical factors and all
of the secondary cytogenetic aberrations were significantly
different in patients with a MYC abnormality compared to
those patients without this abnormality.

Clinical characteristics
As shown in Table 1, the median age of the
50 patients was 55.5 years (range 33–91); there were
38 male patients (76%). All of the patients had bone
marrow involvement at diagnosis that was identified by
flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy. The indolent MCL
was excluded by the short clinical course and aggressive
medical history. Eighteen patients (36%) had B symptoms
and 36 patients (72%) had splenomegaly at diagnosis. The
median white blood cell (WBC) was 44.73 × 109/L (range
2.63–193.78), and the median β2 microglobulin (MG) was
4.45 mg/L (range from 1.95 to 12.7). Based on the MCL
international prognostic index (MIPI) system, 26 patients
(52%) were classified as high-risk, and 12 patients each
(24%) were classified as medium- and low-risk.

Cytogenetic aberrations
All of the patients were CCND1/IGH positive
according to FISH, as the diagnosis required. Thirty-eight
patients (76%) had at least one of the second cytogenetic
aberrations. The incidences of the second cytogenetic
aberrations were as follows: eighteen patients had a 13q
deletion (36.0%); nine patients had an ATM deletion
(18.0%); seventeen patients had a TP53 deletion (34.0%);
eighteen patients had a MYC abnormality (36.0%); and
twelve had a BCL2 abnormality (24.0%). Among the
eighteen patients with a MYC abnormality, all of them had
a MYC gains and/or amplifications and only 4 patients
had translocation signals detected by the MYC dual color
break-apart rearrangement probe. These patients did not

Survival and prognosis

cytarabine could overcome the adverse prognosis of
MYC abnormality or del 17p. Firstly, we validate the
prognostic role of MYC abnormality and del 17p in
27 patients treated with HyperCVAD ± R/MA ± R.
There were 8 patients with MYC abnormality and del
17p respectively. Patients with MYC abnormality had
significantly shorter median PFS (5.5 vs. 74.0 months,
p = .003) and OS (10 months vs. not reached, p <.001)
compared with those without. Del 17p also played a
adverse role in this treatment background for both PFS
(5.5 vs. 74.0 months, p = .001) and OS (10 months vs. not
reached, p = .001). Then, we focused on the therapy of
patients with a MYC abnormality. Five patients received
R-Hyper CVAD/R-MA alternative chemotherapy,
three received the Hyper CVAD/MA regimen, and the
other ten patients were treated with CHOP/CHOPlike ± R regimen. There was no advantage with regard
to PFS (median PFS 5.5 vs.10.0 months, p = .231) or
OS (median OS 10.0 vs. 12.0 months, p = .416) for the
8 patients treated with intensive chemotherapy compared
with the 10 patients who received non-intensive
chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic model also did
not change the survival of patients with del 17p. Among

During the median follow-up period of 22.5 months
(range 2–188.0), 28 patients had died. The median overall
survival (OS) for the entire cohort of patients was 32.0
months (95%CI 20.8–43.2), with median progress-free
survival (PFS) of 24 months (95% CI 6.9–41.1). Then,
we analyzed the prognostic factors for this population. As
shown in Table 3, we identified using the Kaplan-Meier
method that MIPI high-risk status, a 13q or 17p deletion,
MYC abnormality and any cytogenetic aberrations had an
adverse prognostic effect on PFS. In addition, the deletion
of 13q or 17p, MYC abnormality and receiving CHOP/
CHOP-like ± R chemotherapy had an adverse prognostic
effect on OS. BCL2 abnormality did not significantly
influence neither PFS nor OS. Then, we constructed a
Cox regression models for PFS and OS using the positive
factors in the univariate analysis. Deletions of 17p and
MYC abnormality were the two independent factors for
PFS and OS, as shown in Table 4 and Figures 1 and 2.
As the chemotherapeutic regimens significantly
influence the survival (shown in Table 3), we want
to know whether the regimens containing high-dose

with another recurrent breakpoint, such as BCL2, BCL6,
BCL3 or CCND1. The most common type of double-hit
occurs with a MYC/8q24 and BCL2/18q21 breakpoint [1].
However, DHL is not a diagnosis recognized in the WHO
classification system, and the DHL only refers to DLBCL,
B-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate
between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma(BCLU),
follicular lymphoma and even lymphoblastic lymphoma
in the literature. Thus, the definition of DH lymphoma
is controversial. Swerdlow ST [2] proposed that DH
lymphomas should be restricted to either DLBCL, NOS
or BCLU cases that cannot be better classified as a more
specific type of lymphoma. A mantle cell lymphoma
with a MYC and CCND1 translocation should still
be diagnosed as a mantle cell lymphoma even if the
MYC rearrangement has additional clinicopathologic
implications. The incidence of MYC/BCL2 DHL is
2–12% in DLBCL and 32–78% in BCLU [2] and is
associated with aggressive clinical characteristics and poor

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

survival. The concurrent presence of a MYC and CCND1
rearrangement is rare, accounting for approximately 10%
of the patients with double hit and triple hit lymphomas
in the Mitelman database [1]. However, the incidence
of MYC/BCL2 double rearrangements in MCL had not
been reported and it is not known what role MYC/BCL2
rearrangement has in MCL.
Setoodeh R et al [3] reported four MCL cases with
MYC abnormality and summarized the characteristics of
26 MCL cases with secondary cytogenetic abnormalities
involving the MYC gene in the literature. This publication
was a comprehensive report on MYC abnormalities
in MCL. Among the reported four cases, three cases
exhibited a MYC gene translocation and one demonstrated
MYC amplification [3]. Additionally, for the 26 cases
with MYC abnormality in the literature, 15 had a MYC
translocation and 11 had an additional 8q24 or MYC
amplification as analyzed by FISH or conventional
karyotype [3]. However, in our series all the 18 patients

42367

Oncotarget

had a MYC gain/amplification and only four patients
had an accompanying MYC translocation, which was
definitely different from the literature [3–5].
In the literatures, patients with a MYC abnormity
always had extensive bone marrow involvement or
leukemic presentation [3, 6–8]. In this study, all of the
50 patients had extensive bone marrow and/or peripheral
blood involvement. We compared the clinical and other
secondary cytogenetic aberrations between patients with
and without a MYC abnormality. There was a higher
median WBC, higher percentage of patients belonging
to the medium-high MIPI risk group and high tumor
burden with higher β2-MG for the MYC abnormality
group. The MYC abnormality group also had higher
genomic instability as more patients in this group had
secondary cytogenetic aberrations. It is well known
that MYC dysregulation has the ability to affect gene
regulation, microRNA expression profiles, large genomic
amplifications and ultimately initiates a dynamic process
of genomic instability that is linked to tumor initiation [9].
So, cases of MCL with a MYC abnormality represent a
relatively unique group with highly aggressive clinical and
biological behavior.
MYC abnormality had been reported to be associated
with high proliferation index in MCL [3, 6, 7]. High
Ki67 index is also a strong prognosis predicator in MCL
with a generally accepted cut-off 30% [10, 11]. We had
detected Ki67 index in 13 patients with lymph node biopsy,
with three patients had Ki67 index more than 30% (data
not shown). Among these 13 patients, four had MYC
abnormality with 2 having Ki67 more than 30% (2/4,
50%), while nine patients had no MYC aberration with
only one patient having high Ki67 index (1/9, 11.1%). So
patients with MYC abnormality may have high Ki67 index
but without statistic significance (p = .203) in this study,
which may attribute to the limited size of available patients.
Intensive chemotherapy, such as the HyperCVAD/
MA ± R regimen, can improve the survival of younger
MCL patients, and this strategy has been established as
the standard treatment for this population [12]. Then, we
determined if the HyperCVAD/MA ± R regimen could
improve the survival of patients with a MYC abnormality.
Unfortunately, this regimen had no impact on the survival
of these patients. MYC has been reported to amplify B
cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which plays a important
role in the pathogenesis of MCL, and increases its own
levels via upregulation of miR-17-92 and subsequent
targeting immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motif
(ITIM) proteins. Consistent with the propensity of ITIM
proteins to recruit phosphatases, expression of MYC
sustain the BCR signaling pathway by phosphorylation of
it’s downstream such as spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and
the B-cell linker protein (BLNK) [13]. So BCR signaling
pathway inhibitors may have efficiency in patients with
MYC abnormality. Actually, BTK inhibitor ibrutinib has
shown amazing results for relapsed and/or refractory MCL
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[14, 15]. Other new drug, such as lenalidomide [16], also
aim to function as a high efficiency treatment for patients
with relapsed or refractory MCL. A new strategy targeting
MYC-dependent tumors is also under development [17]
and may improve the outcome of these patients in the
future.
Unlike studies of MYC, there have been no studies
about BCL2 abnormalities in MCL. Therefore, we first
demonstrated a high incidence of BCL2 amplification in
MCL with extensive BMI, and no BCL2 translocations
were identified. Some studies have reported that 11–26%
patients demonstrate a gain of 18q11-q23, where the
BCL2 gene is located, detected by comparative genomic
hybridization [18]. This incidence rate is in accordance
with our results. Unlike other aggressive B-cell
lymphomas, BCL2 translocation may not occur in MCL,
which indicates that BCL2 and CCND1 translocations
might be mutually exclusive. As high levels of Bcl-2
may indicate that downstream apoptotic pathways are
still functional and can be a marker of chemosensitivity
and favorable prognosis in certain cancers [19], it is not
surprising BCL2 abnormality did not have a prognostic
role for MCL in this study.
MCL has some similarities with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL), such as a mature lymphocyte morphology
and expression of CD5. The cytogenetic aberrations that
frequently occur in CLL have been evaluated in MCL
[20]. Unlike in CLL, the prognostic role of del 17p and
11q is controversial. Some studies have found that losses
of 17p13 and 11q22-q23 were not associated with poorer
outcome [20–22], but other researchers have observed a
significant correlation between overall survival and the loss
of 11q22-q23 and 17p13 [6, 23, 24]. The loss of 13q14 is
an independent factor for overall survival in many studies
[20, 22, 23], which is significantly different from CLL
in which the loss of 13q14 is considered a good marker
for survival. In our study, del 13q, del11q and del 17p all
influence survival of MCL patients, but only del17p was an
independent adverse prognostic factor for these patients.
As we know, t(11;14) translocation and cyclin
D1 overexpression is thought to be the primary event
in the pathogenesis of the tumour. But cyclin D1 is not
enough to develop spontaneous lymphomas in transgenic
mice. And low numbers of cells carrying the t(11;14)
translocation have been found in the blood of 1–2% of
healthy individuals without any evidence of disease
[18]. So second cytogenetic hit is required for the
lymphomagenesis of MCL. The MYC abnormality may
act as the accomplice to the tumour transformation and
aggressive behavior. MYC had been reported to cooperate
with cyclin D1 to develop B cell lymphoma in transgenic
mice [25, 26]. In aspect of the aggressive clinical outcome,
MYC abnormality may be one of the important second
cytogenetic event for the evolution of MCL. MCL is one
of the malignant lymphoid neoplasms with the highest
level of genomic instability. The DNA damage response
42368

pathway alterations may constitute another important
pathogenetic mechanism in this lymphoma [18]. Deletion
of ATM and/or p53 is the main alternation of this pathway.
So this may partially explain why patients with p53 or
ATM deletion had poor survival.
In conclusion, there was a high incidence of MYC
and BCL2 gain and/or amplification in MCL patients
with bone marrow involvement. MYC abnormality is
the independent adverse factor for PFS and OS, and
BCL2 amplification had no significant influence on
survival in MCL patients. Intensive chemotherapy such
as HyperCVAD/MA ± R did not improve the survival of
patients with a MYC abnormality, and a new treatment
strategy should be developed. This is a preliminary
conclusion and should be validated in multicentric studies
based on larger cohort patients under unique chemotherapy.

Fusion Translocation Probe and LSI IGH/MYC/CEP 8 TriColor Dual Fusion Probes. Gains were defined as three
copies of the gene studied, whereas at least four copies
were considered as amplifications [29].

Treatment
All of the 50 patients had received at least 2 cycles
of chemotherapy with 80% patients completing the
presupposed chemotherapeutic cycles. Twenty-seven
patients received HyperCVAD ± R (cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone ± rituximab)
alternating with MA (methotrexate and cytarabine)
± R, whereas twenty-three patients received CHOP
(cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and
dexamethasone ± rituximab) or CHOP-like ± R regimens.
Twenty-six patients received rituximab combined
chemotherapy. Of the 27 patients treated with HyperCVAD
± R alternating with MA ± R, the median chemotherapeutic
cycle is 6 (2–9), 22 patients (81%) had completed at least
6 cycles. For the 23 patients in the CHOP/CHOP-like ± R
group, the median cycle is 8 (2–10) with 18 patients(78%)
had received at least 6 chemotherapeutic cycles.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
During the period from July 2003 through November
2012, 50 MCL patients with bone marrow involvement
(BMI) were diagnosed at the Institute of Hematology and
Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences and Peking Union Medical College (CAMS
& PUMC). All patients enrolled informed consent in
accordance with requirements of the Declaration of
Helsinki, and the research project was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards. The essential medical records
captured in this study included basic demographics (age,
gender), performance status, Ann Arbor stage, presence of
extra nodal sites, chromosome karyotype, bone marrow
biology and peripheral blood morphology, hematological
parameters, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, as
well as treatment and outcomes. Histologic specimens
were reviewed by hematopathologists, including two of
the authors, according to the WHO classification system
[27]. All bone marrow tissues evaluated in this study were
assessed at the time of initial staging. This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of CAMS & PUMC.

Survival and statistical analysis
Overall survival (OS) was measured as the interval
between the date of treatment and the date of death or last
follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured
as the interval between the date of treatment and the
date of death from any cause or disease progression.
Fisher’s exact test or the chi-square test was used to
determine statistically significant differences between
the clinical characteristics of the two groups. Survival
curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method,
and prognostic features were evaluated by univariate
analysis (log-rank test). The effects of potential prognostic
variables on survival were assessed according to the
Cox regression method. P values < .05 were considered
statistically significant. All calculations were performed
using the SPSS statistical software package (Version 13.0).

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
FISH analysis was performed on the samples for
conventional karyotype studies. The DNA probe ‘panels’
included probes for 13q14.3 (LSI D13S25 and RB-1),
14q32 (LSI IGHC/IGHV), 17p13 (LSI p53), 11q22 (LSI
ATM), LSI BCL2 (18q32) and MYC (8q24) Dual Color,
Break Apart Rearrangement Probe, LSI IGH/BCL2 Dual
Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe and LSI IGH/
MYC/CEP 8 Tri-Color Dual Fusion Probes and LSI
CCND1/IGH Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation
Probe. All probes were purchased from Vysis (USA).
Sample preparations and hybridizations were conducted
following the manufacturer’s recommendations and as
