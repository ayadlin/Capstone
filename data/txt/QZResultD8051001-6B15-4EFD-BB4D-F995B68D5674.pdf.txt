BACKGROUND: Cilengitide is a selective integrin inhibitor that is well tolerated and has demonstrated biologic activity in patients
with recurrent malignant glioma. The primary objectives of this randomized phase 2 trial were to determine the safety and efficacy of
cilengitide when combined with radiation and temozolomide for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme and to select
a dose for comparative clinical testing. METHODS: In total, 112 patients were accrued. Eighteen patients received standard radiation
and temozolomide with cilengitide in a safety run-in phase followed by a randomized phase 2 trial with 94 patients assigned to either
a 500 mg dose group or 2000 mg dose group. The trial was designed to estimate overall survival benefit compared with a New
Approaches to Brain Tumor Therapy (NABTT) Consortium internal historic control and data from the published European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial EORTC 26981. RESULTS: Cilengitide at all doses studied was well tolerated
with radiation and temozolomide. The median survival was 19.7 months for all patients, 17.4 months for the patients in the 500 mg
dose group, 20.8 months for patients in the 2000 mg dose group, 30 months for patients who had methylated O6-methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status, and 17.4 months for patients who had unmethylated MGMT status. For patients aged 70
years, the median survival and survival at 24 months was superior to what was observed in the EORTC trial (20.7 months vs 14.6
months and 41% vs 27%, respectively; P ¼ .008). CONCLUSIONS: Cilengitide was well tolerated when combined with standard chemoradiation and may improve survival for patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme regardless of MGMT methylation status. The authors concluded that, from an efficacy and safety standpoint, future trials of this agent in this population should use the

INTRODUCTION
Cilengitide (cyclo-L-Arg-Gly-L-Asp-D-Phe-N [Me] L-Val) (EMD 121974; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a
cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-containing peptide that binds to avb3 and avb5 with nanomolar affinity.1 In cellbased assays, cilengitide inhibited both avb3-mediated and avb5-mediated function with 50% inhibitory concentration
values in the low-micromolar range and also inhibited angiogenesis in in vitro model systems.2,3 In preclinical animal
studies of glioma in both mice and rat models, cilengitide demonstrated tumor control and survival advantages.4-7
The experience of cilengitide in patients with glioma also has demonstrated biologic activity as measured by
responses, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The initial phase 1 study in recurrent malignant
glioma by Nabors et al failed to define a maximum tolerated dose but did suggest that higher doses were more active by
measuring improvements in tumor blood flow with perfusion magnetic resonance imaging.8 A randomized phase 2 trial
in patients with recurrent disease evaluated low and high doses of the drug and likewise suggested greater biologic activity

at the higher dose (2000 mg twice weekly).9 In newly
diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM),
cilengitide at a dose of 500 mg twice weekly was combined with standard therapy: radiation and temozolomide
(RTþTMZ).10 Compared with historic controls,
those authors noted improvements in both PFS and OS
that appeared to be enhanced in the O6-methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylated patient
population.
Thus, the results detailed above provide a rationale
for the study of integrin antagonists in the setting of primary brain malignancies. The current study was undertaken to determine the toxicities of cilengitide in patients
with newly diagnosed GBM and to determine the OS of
patients who receive different doses of the agent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria

This study was sponsored by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program at the National Cancer Institute and was
conducted by the New Approaches to Brain Tumor Therapy (NABTT) Central Nervous System Consortium. The
protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review board at each participating institution and all
patients signed informed consent.
Patients who were eligible for enrollment met the
following criteria: aged 18 years; newly diagnosed and
histologically proven glioblastoma; maintained on a stable
dose of corticosteriods for 5 days; recovered from previous surgery; a Karnofsky performance status (KPS)
60%; adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function; agreed to practice acceptable birth control method; a
mini-mental status examination score of 15; and capable of providing informed consent.
Treatment Plan

This trial was designed as an open-label, randomized,
phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cilengitide in terms of OS. In addition, it was designed to pick 1
of 2 cilengitide doses in combination with standard
RTþTMZ to be used in future clinical trials in this
patient population. The phase 2 study was preceded by a
safety run-in combining cilengitide with standard chemoradiation for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
In total, 3 predefined doses (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 2000
mg twice weekly) were selected. The study drug was
infused intravenously over a 1-hour period on a twiceweekly schedule with a minimum of 72 hours between
infusions for 4 weeks. This 4-week interval was considered
a treatment cycle. The starting dose and schedule were
5602

selected based on previous studies of cilengitide in patients
with malignant glioma.8,9 Toxicity was evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria version 3. Temozolomide was administered daily
at 75 mg/M2 concurrent with radiation therapy followed
by a maintenance phase of 150 to 200 mg/M2 for 5 consecutive days of every 28-day cycle. Radiation therapy
consisted of the conventional treatment used by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. This consisted of treatment to the tumor plus a generous margin for a total dose
of 6000 centigrays in 30 fractions. During the randomized phase 2 portion, patients were randomized into 1 of 2
treatment groups (500 mg or 2000 mg) using a stratified
and randomly permuted blocks method. The stratification was based on common prognostic factors of the disease to include age (50 years or >50 years), KPS (80%
or >80%), and tumor status (measurable disease or
unmeasurable disease). Patients were received adjuvant
temozolomide for 6 months and received cilengitide until
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary
withdrawal.
Study Requirements

Tumor tissue from the patient’s surgery at diagnosis was
collected to determine MGMT methylation status.
Patients underwent evaluation of measurable disease by
cranial magnetic resonance imaging 4 weeks after they
completed cilengitide plus chemoradiation and again 8
weeks thereafter. Laboratory studies, including a chemistry profile and liver function enzymes, were determined at
baseline and before each odd-numbered maintenance
cycle. Complete blood counts were obtained at baseline,
weekly during radiation therapy, and monthly during
maintenance therapy. A urinalysis, electrocardiogram,
and chest x-ray were obtained at baseline.
O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase
Promoter Methylation Testing

Patient samples were tested for MGMT promoter methylation status using previously described procedures11 by
MDxHealth (Liege, Belgium). Briefly, 40 microns of a
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sample were
deparaffinized and digested, and the genomic DNA was
isolated using the standard phenol-chloroform method.
Up to 1500 ng of DNA were then treated with sodium
bisulfite, resulting in the deamination of nonmethylated
cytosine bases to uracil bases. Quantitative polymerase
chain reaction analysis for the methylated version of the
MGMT gene and for the b-actin gene (ACTB) was then
performed on the sample. The b-actin gene was used to
establish sample quality and also was used to normalize

the test output. A threshold of 1250 copies of ACTB
was necessary to properly interpret the sample. The
normalized ratio of methylated MGMT (mMGMT)
copy numbers to ACTB copy numbers was then
calculated (mMGMT/ACTB  1000). Samples with
an mMGMT:ACTB ratio of 2 were considered methylated; below this ratio, the samples were considered
unmethylated.
Statistical Considerations

The trial was designed to accrue 94 patients, and the analysis required 63 deaths. This would provide 94% power
to detect a reduction 30% in the hazard of death (the
hazard rate) compared with the NABTT internal historic
control at an aalpha level of .1. Comparison with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) data also was proposed. Survival was calculated
from the date of histologic diagnosis to the date of death
from any cause, and surviving patients were censored at
the date of last follow-up. The trial also was designed to
further evaluate drug safety and to identify either the 500mg or the 2000-mg dose as the best for future clinical trials in this setting. This trial design was chosen as a consequence of our previous NABTT phase 1 study of this
agent, which suggested that toxicities at the 2 dose levels
would be similar and that activity occurred across the
range of doses tested.8 The overall hazard rate of death
was defined as the number of deaths per person-years of
follow-up. A decision rule was included in the trial design
specifying that a reduction 30% in the hazard rate compared with the NABTT internal historic control (which
did not include temozolomide-treated patients) would
provide strong evidence to proceed to a formal comparative trial.
Patient characteristics and toxicities were summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics. The chisquare statistic was used for proportion comparison, and
the Student t test was used for comparisons of continuous
data.
The method of Kaplan and Meier12 was used to estimate OS. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
using standard methods. A Cox proportional-hazards
regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio for
death attributable to the treatment and to prognostic factors. To pick a more efficacious dose in terms of an OS
advantage, the 2 doses were compared using a nonparametric log-rank test. All reported P values are 2-sided, and
all analyses were performed using the SAS statistical software package (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Between April 2005 and December 2007, 112 patients
were enrolled into the study. Their characteristics are
described in Table 1. All patients had undergone previous
surgery and were diagnosed histologically with glioblastoma. The patient characteristics and prognostic factors
were well balanced between treatment groups and were
comparable to those of historic controls. At the time of
data cutoff (May 30, 2010), 6 patients were continuing to
receive study drug infusions.
Toxicity

Patient infusion with cilengitide did not produce any
acute toxicities. During the safety run-in portion of the
study, there were no dose-limiting toxicities at any dose
level that were sufficient to define a maximum tolerated
dose. During the randomized phase, hematologic and
nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 adverse events were distributed relatively evenly, with 48 such events occurring in
the 500-mg cohort and 35 occurring in the 2000-mg
cohort. Hematologic toxicities comprised 58% of the
adverse events among patients in the 500-mg dose cohort
and 34% of the adverse events among patients in the
2000-mg cohort. These adverse events were attributed
uniformly to RTþTMZ. The nonhematologic toxicities
also were spread fairly evenly across the dose groups and
exhibited no consistent, concerning toxicity profiles. Table 2 presents the range of adverse events observed.
Response Assessment
Overall survival

The estimated median survival for all 112 patients
enrolled on this study was 19.7 months (95% CI, 16.621.9.months). The overall hazard rate of death was 0.494
(95% CI, 0.4-0.6) per person-year of follow-up (Fig. 1),
and the estimated 2 year OS rate was 38% (95% CI,
29%-48%). No patients were lost to follow-up.
Compared with the NABTT historic control group,
which did not include patients who received treatment
with temozolomide, the unadjusted hazard ratio of death
was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.32-0.53; P ¼ .0001), which constitutes a 59% reduction in the hazard of death. After adjusting for known prognostic factors (age (P ¼ .0003), KPS
(P ¼ .004), and surgical procedure (P ¼ .003), the
adjusted hazard ratio of death was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.3-0.5;
P < .0001). In this trial, 101 patients were aged 70
years. Their median survival was 20.7 months (95% CI,
17.2-24.0 months), which was better than the similarly
aged patients in the EORTC study, in which RTþTMZ
also was used and the median survival was 14.6 months

Progression-free survival

PFS was not a primary objective of this trial. However, disease progression was recorded on the patient follow-up form as an off-treatment criterion. PFS was
calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of disease
progression. In total, 103 of 112 patients (92%) developed progressive disease or died by the data cutoff date.
The median PFS was 9.97 months (95% CI, 8.3-11.1

CI, 6.9-12.2 months) for the 500-mg dose group and 9.3
months (95% CI, 7.7-11.1 months) for the 2000-mg

adjusted hazard ratio of PFS was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.671.68) for patients in the 2000-mg dose group versus the
500-mg dose group.
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase status

In total, 88 of 112 patients (79%) had tumor tissue
collected at baseline. A neuropathologic review determined that 79 patients had adequate tissue for baseline
MGMT assessment. At baseline, 21 of 112 patients (19%)
had methylated MGMT status, 48 patients (43%) had
unmethylated MGMT status, and 43 patients (38%) had
unknown MGMT methylation status; hence, the frequency of methylated MGMT status among evaluable
patients was 30% (21 of 69 patients). The patients with
unknown MGMT methylation status included those who
were tested but were judged invalid either because of an
insufficient number of ACTB gene copies or because tumor tissue was not collected or was not available. OS
stratified only according to baseline MGMT methylation
status for all 112 evaluable patients is illustrated in Figure
3. The estimated median OS of patients who had methylated, unmethylated, and unknown MGMT status was 30
months (95% CI, 16.6-35.4 months), 19.1 months (95%
CI, 14.6-21.9 months), and 17.4 months (95% CI, 13.724.2 months), respectively.
DISCUSSION
In this report, we extend our previous studies with the
integrin antagonist cilengitide to the newly diagnosed
glioblastoma population and augment the safety and toxicity description of the compound with standard radiation
and chemotherapy. Overall, cilengitide was well tolerated
without new or unexpected toxicities in this patient population when combined with RTþTMZ. Most of the
adverse events noted in the trial were consistent with the
expected toxicities of standard chemoradiation. Specific
events that may be induced or attributed by an agent with
antiangiogenic or anti-invasive properties, such as hemorrhage, were not noted. These findings are consistent with
other studies of cilengitide for newly diagnosed GBM.10
The primary endpoints of this study were to evaluate
OS in patients with newly diagnosed GBM who received
treatment with cilengitide in conjunction with standard chemoradiation and to select a dose for comparative clinical trial
testing. The trial achieved a 61% reduction in the hazard
5606

rate of death compared with the NABTT historic control
database, exceeding the protocol decision rule of a reduction
30% in the failure rate. Because the NABTT historic database did not include the receipt of temozolomide administered with and after radiation, the analysis planned before
the 2005 publication of the EORTC results is of marginal
importance in the current therapeutic environment. However, the observed median OS for all 112 patients enrolled
on the trial was 19.7 months, which compares very favorably
with the 16.1 months reported from a recent study of lowdose cilengitide (500 mg) in the same setting10 and with the
14.6 months noted in the EORTC phase 3 trial,13 which
included a better prognostic group of only patients aged
70 years. In addition, the patients who received cilengitide
had improved 2-year survival for similarly aged patients
(41% vs 27%).
Secondary objectives of this study were to examine toxicity and survival in patients treated with low doses (500 mg)
and high doses (2000 mg) of cilengitide and to choose the
dose that should be studied in future phase 3 trials. The toxicities were similar. However, the median OS was 20.8
months for the 2000-mg group and 17.4 months for the
500-mg group (adjusted hazard ratio of death, 0.8), and the
2-year survival rate was 44% in the 2000-mg group and
28% in the 500-mg group. Although these differences were
not statistically different using a Cox regression model (data
not shown), the current trial was not intended or powered to
conduct such a comparison, as our goal was simply to select
the best dose to study in the future. These data strongly suggest that cilengitide at a dose of 2000 mg twice weekly with
standard radiation and chemotherapy is the superior choice
for phase 3 trials in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.
It has been demonstrated that determining MGMT
methylation status in GBM can predict survival.14 We
were able to determine MGMT status in 62% of the
patients on study and identified 21 patients (30%) with
methylated MGMT of 69 patients who had valid test
results. In Figure 3, Kaplan-Meier survival curves illustrate improved survival for patients who had methylated
MGMT relative to those with unmethylated and
unknown MGMT status. This observation is in keeping
with other studies. It was not possible for us to make a reasonable analysis of the effect MGMT status on survival
based on the dose of cilengitide because of the small numbers of evaluable patients. However, it appears that cilengitide had an impact on survival for patients with
unmethylated and methylated MGMT. We observed a
median OS of 30 months for the methylated group and
19.1 months for the unmethylated group. This indicates
an improvement for both genotypes compared with the

results reported from EORTC 26981, in which patients
with methylated MGMT who received RTþTMZ had a
median OS of 21.7 months compared with 12.7 months
for patients with unmethylated MGMT.
The use of an integrin antagonist in the treatment of
malignant glioma is emerging as a strong complement to
RTþTMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The
ability to exploit the novel integrin-mediated signaling
cascade brings to bear a new class of compounds for the
treatment of this disease. The randomized nature of the
current study provides strong support for use of the 2000mg dose and lays a foundation for the current comparative
trials ongoing with cilengitide (CENTRIC). In addition,
the different mechanism of action and excellent tolerability may permit use the combination of cilengitide with
antivascular endothelial growth factor agents to treat
patients with newly diagnosed GBM.15
