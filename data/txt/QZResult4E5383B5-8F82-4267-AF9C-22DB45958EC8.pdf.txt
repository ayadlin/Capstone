BACKGROUND: Response and survival in 96 patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) who
received aggressive induction chemotherapy was reviewed. METHODS: The median follow-up of survivors
was 2.3 years. A total of 70 (73%) patients achieved a morphologic complete remission (CR) confirmed by
absence of leukemic blasts by flow cytometry. RESULTS: For all 96 patients, the median event-free survival
(EFS) was 8 months, and overall survival (OS) was 13.6 months (range, 1-119 months). Eight patients died
shortly after induction therapy because of disease or side effects, and 13 are currently in continuous first
remission. The median disease-free survival (DFS) for all 70 patients who achieved a morphologic CR was
9 months (range, 1-51 months), with a 64% chance of surviving 1 year. Patients with AML after previous
chemotherapy or radiation therapy had a higher morphologic remission rate compared with those arising
from myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disease (82% vs 62%; P ¼ .027). However, among the
patients from the 2 groups who attained a morphologic remission, there was no difference in terms of CR
rate (P ¼ .94), DFS, EFS, or OS (P ¼ .55, .83, and .71, respectively). This is a similar DFS to the group of 7
patients who went directly to ablative allogeneic transplant rather than having induction therapy first. In
this population of patients who received aggressive chemotherapy, Charlson comorbidity index or a higher
number of factors recognized as high risk in leukemia patients did not affect the chance of OS, DFS, and
EFS, although having more recognized leukemia risk factors was related to a lower chance of surviving 1
year. However, it is important to note that those with higher comorbidity indexes were underrepresented in
this aggressively treated cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study demonstrate that
many patients with sAML can tolerate aggressive induction therapy and attain remission, but duration of

Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) can be defined as AML arising in a patient with a history
of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative disease (MPD), or prior exposure to leukemogenic therapy. It has further been noted that primary AML with multilineage dysplasia has a similar poor

outcome to sAML and likely a similar biology.1 The risk
of developing a secondary malignancy within 20 years of
diagnosis of the first cancer is estimated at 10%, with leukemia being the most common,2-5 and AML secondary to
prior therapies accounts for approximately 5% of all
AML.5-7 Patients with sAML have been reported to have
remission rates of only 25% to 33% with ‘‘standard’’ aggressive induction therapy, and long-term survival is poor,
defining this group as a high-risk group compared with de
novo AML.8-12 However, to our knowledge, there remains
little information in the peer-reviewed literature to better
characterize these patients using comorbidity status or disease risk profiling and long-term outcomes with current
supportive care after aggressive induction. We performed a
retrospective review of patients with sAML seen at our center who were considered candidates for aggressive induction
therapies to evaluate the benefit of the standard aggressive
therapies in terms of remission rates and durability of
response. This provides a foundation for comparison for
future cytotoxic agents under development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We identified 154 patients with sAML seen at Duke University Medical Center in our Medical Oncology Clinic
or Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Clinic between November of 1995 and July of 2008. Of these 154 patients,
23 were only seen once for consultation regarding therapy
or pathology review, but were never treated at our center.
Two had their records destroyed before this retrospective
review because they had been dead for >7 years. Fifteen
patients never received aggressive induction. Eleven
patients were recently enrolled in trials of investigational
agents and will be reported elsewhere. Seven patients proceeded directly to transplant before ever being induced
with aggressive chemotherapy. This resulted in a group of
96 patients treated with standard aggressive induction
chemotherapy for inclusion in this review, which was
approved by our local internal review board.
Data Analysis
Both electronic and written patient records were reviewed
to ensure accurate follow-up through July 28, 2008.
Response was assessed using standardized criteria.1 For

the purposes of this analysis, overall survival (OS) was
defined as the time from the initial induction therapy
given for AML until death. Disease-free survival (DFS)
was defined for patients who achieved a remission as the
time from the initial induction therapy given for AML
until disease recurrence or death, whichever occurred first.
Leukemia-free survival (LFS) was defined for patients
who achieved a remission as the time from the date of
therapy inducing a remission until disease recurrence.
Event-free survival (EFS) was defined for all patients as
the time from the initial induction therapy given for AML
until disease recurrence or death, whichever occurred first.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Patients included in this review were balanced with
respect to sex and roughly equal numbers of cases of
leukemia secondary to prior exposures or with underlying
dysplasia (Table 1). As seen from this table, patients typically accepted for aggressive induction therapies at our
center belonged to a low-risk group based on their leukemia risk profile and the Charlson comorbidity index.13
Specifically, using the descriptors in the risk profile (Table
1), although they commonly had unfavorable cytogenetics, typically they were <70 years of age, had a good performance status, and were without significant pulmonary,
hepatic, or cardiac disease. By using the Charlson index,
few had a score 5, also indicating a reasonably fit group
when evaluated according to this criterion.
Prior Treatments and Induction
Therapy for sAML
Before induction therapy, most patients received transfusions and/or growth factor support, as well as chemotherapy for MDS not intended to induce a molecular
remission (hydroxyurea, cyclophosphamide, thalidomide,
hypomethylators). Only 12% had prior exposure to more
aggressive chemotherapy for their MDS before developing
sAML. Of the 96 patients, 76 (79%) patients were given
standard induction with 7 days of infused cytarabine and
3 days of an anthracycline (7 þ 3). The other 20 (21%)
patients were treated with a variety of other aggressive chemotherapies (Table 2). To the degree that consolidation
therapies affect long-term outcome, the overall survival

96 patients treated with aggressive induction therapy with
intent of attaining a remission, 8 patients died within 42
days of induction: 3 from sepsis and 5 from multiorgan
failure, although the disease could also have contributed
as well. Fifty-six (58%) patients achieved a morphologic
complete remission (CR), although 1 had an incomplete
blood count recovery from the initial cycle of induction
chemotherapy. With additional treatments, a total of 70
(73%) patients achieved a morphologic CR from either
their induction chemotherapy or later attempts, and all 70
had a normal flow cytometry pattern as well, although 4
had possible persistence of dysplastic morphology noted
on the marrow exam. With current high-resolution and
molecular techniques, the persistence of dysplasia as a sole
finding after induction remains of unclear significance.
The persistent morphologic dysplasia can be attributed to
either direct effect of recent chemotherapy or the persistence of the original myelodysplastic clone. In the absence
of increased blasts, normocellular bone marrow, recovering peripheral counts, and the original cytogenetic abnormality (when tested), the morphological dysplasia almost
certainly indicates a direct effect of chemotherapy. With
this consideration, we have included these patients in the
CR category. Detailed cytogenetic analysis was available
for 56 of 70 patients with morphologic CR (missing data
was primarily because of no growth). Of these 56, 33 had
abnormalities detected before therapy, and 10 had persistence of these abnormalities while in morphologic CR,
indicating that 60 (63%) of 96 met the definition for
cytogenetic remission. Three of the 4 patients in morphologic CR but with concern for persistent dysplasia had
persistent cytogenetic abnormalities as well. Molecular
testing was inconsistently performed, making a valid
assessment for this degree of remission not feasible in this
retrospective analysis.

Survival
For all 96 patients, the median EFS was 8 months, and
median OS was 13.6 months (range, 1-119 months). Sixteen (17%) of the 96 patients were alive as of July 2008.
Of these 16, 13 are currently in continuous first remission
(Fig. 1A). Sixty-six (69%) patients died specifically from
their leukemia (1 within 42 days of induction). Eight
(8%) patients died within 42 days of induction from disease progression and/or complications of therapy. Six

remaining patients died while in remission (2 sepsis, 3
multiorgan failure, 1 squamous cell carcinoma of skin).
The median DFS for all 70 patients who achieved a morphologic CR was 9 months (range, 1-51 month). In the
subgroup of 56 who achieved a CR from the initial induction chemotherapy, the median DFS was 11 months and
OS 21 months. The median DFS for the 14 patients with
primary refractory disease who required reinduction therapy to achieve a CR was 6 months, and median OS was
only 14 months, compared with a median OS of 4
months for those never achieving a remission (Fig. 1B).
The median OS of the 7 patients who went directly to
transplant after diagnosis without ever receiving aggressive
induction therapy was also only 7 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2 months-12 months). Only 1
of these patients remains alive and free of disease disease
>8 months from transplant. The poor durability of the
response is highlighted by the cumulative incidence of recurrence curve (Fig. 1C).
The 1-year OS rate of the 96 patients, as measured
from the initial date of the first induction therapy given
for AML, was 51% (95% CI, 41%-61%). Sixty-four percent (95% CI, 50%-76%) of those who achieved a CR
from their initial induction chemotherapy survived at
least 1 year, compared with 60% (95% CI, 29%-81%) of
those who achieved a CR only with subsequent therapy.
Only 19% (95% CI, 7%-36%) of those patients who
never attained a CR survived at least 1 year.
In this group of 96 patients, 45 were known to have
AML after previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and
51 had AML with a history of MDS or MPD. The overall
CR rate was 82% in the first group and 62% in the second,
with a P value from the Pearson chi-square test of .027,
although the 1-year OS of these 2 groups was comparable
at 54% (95% CI, 42%-70%) and 48% (95% CI, 35%66%), respectively. Furthermore, the median DFS (8.4
months vs 9.5 months; P ¼ .45) and OS (13.9 months vs
12 months; P ¼ .37) were similar (Fig. 1D and E).

Effect of Comorbidities on Outcomes
In the distribution of patients seen at our center and
judged candidates for aggressive induction therapy, few
patients had multiple high-risk factors, and few were in
the higher-risk categories based on the Charlson index
(Table 3). Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression
analysis revealed that OS, DFS, and EFS were not significantly affected by the Charlson comorbidity index (Table
4). A similar lack of predictive value was found in the
probability of 1-year survival as well, although there is a
clear trend that higher-risk patients had a lower probability of survival at 1 year (Table 3). Recognized leukemia
risk factors seemed to predict for a significantly shorter
OS, but not for significant differences in DFS or EFS
(Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Secondary leukemia is recognized as a difficult treatment
dilemma. The illness is more resistant to standard agents,
and current chemotherapies used to overcome drug resistance are often too toxic to apply in this population.1 We
observed a high rate of morphologic CR in patients who

received aggressive therapy, with a manageable early side
effect profile, because <10% died early in the recovery
phase. The type of aggressive induction does not appear to
be a major factor in attaining remission. Although
response rates appear encouraging, this review suggests
that those deemed candidates to undergo aggressive
induction therapy at our center were generally in a lowerrisk group of leukemia patients in terms of typical risk
stratifications and comorbidities. Furthermore, despite
advances in supportive care, the response appears no better than that reported in similar patients over a decade
ago.14,15 In addition, our patients experienced poor durability, with only a 64% chance of surviving 1 year, and a
median DFS of 11 months if they attained remission with
the first cycle of therapy and only 6 months if they
required a second cycle to attain CR. This finding is best
reflected in the cumulative incidence of recurrence curve,
which, unlike a Kaplan-Meier curve, is able to take into
account the competing risk of dying while in disease
remission. Long term, only 16 patients remained alive at
last follow–up; 13 (14%) were in disease remission, 4 of
whom were in the group that did not receive any consolidation therapy.
For those who do attain a remission, the role of consolidation remains undefined as well. There is no proven
benefit of prolonged or intense consolidation in such
patients, because the overall long-term survival is dismal
for the group as a whole. However, it is often noted that
the few long-term remitters in reported studies all received
at least some consolidative therapy.16-18 The data from
the current study reflect this trend as well, although is not
as clear cut as in prior reports. In the group of 13 longterm remitters, 9 were from the group of 32 in CR who
received some form of consolidation, whereas only 4 were
from the group of 24 in CR with no consolidation. However, recognizing the limits of a retrospective review, the
reasons for not receiving consolidation varied from poor
performance status to patient/physician choice.
Comparisons with other reports are difficult in this
setting, with an older patient population. Risk profiles
and comorbidities are often not detailed. Our patients
were largely noted to have few multiple comorbidities
from the Charlson index and a lower risk overall using the
risk profile. Although in this setting of secondary leukemia they were not very contributory in predicting outcomes, our population may be skewed with only a few
2928

patients in the higher quartile of comorbidities, thus making the distribution narrow and potentially masking the
contribution of the indexes in assessing outcomes in the
very ill. Furthermore, given the overall poor outcome for
all patients with sAML, evaluating the contribution of
known risk factors or the Charlson index may have to
await the development of agents better able to provide
durable responses to a larger portion of patients.
The data reported herein serve to highlight the difficulty facing patients with sAML. When offered aggressive
chemotherapy, many survive and attain remission,
although durability of remission remains a major disappointment. Novel approaches to improve durability of
response are needed.
