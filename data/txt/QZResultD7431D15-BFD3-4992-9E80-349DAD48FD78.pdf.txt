Abstract
Small-molecule Smac mimetics are being developed as a novel
class of anticancer drugs. Recent studies have shown that
Smac mimetics target cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein
(cIAP)-1/2 for degradation and induce tumor necrosis factorA (TNFA)–dependent apoptosis in tumor cells. In this study,
we have investigated the mechanism of action and therapeutic
potential of two different types of novel Smac mimetics,
monovalent SM-122 and bivalent SM-164. Our data showed
that removal of cIAP-1/2 by Smac mimetics or small
interfering RNA is not sufficient for robust TNFA-dependent
apoptosis induction, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
protein (XIAP) plays a critical role in inhibiting apoptosis
induction. Although SM-164 is modestly more effective than
SM-122 in induction of cIAP-1/2 degradation, SM-164 is 1,000
times more potent than SM-122 as an inducer of apoptosis in
tumor cells, which is attributed to its much higher potency in
binding to and antagonizing XIAP. SM-164 induces rapid
cIAP-1 degradation and strong apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231
xenograft tumor tissues and achieves tumor regression, but
has no toxicity in normal mouse tissues. Our study provides
further insights into the mechanism of action for Smac
mimetics and regulation of apoptosis by inhibitor of apoptosis
proteins. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that SM-164
is a promising new anticancer drug for further evaluation and
development. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9384–93]

Introduction
Defects in the apoptosis machinery provide a survival
advantage to cancer cells and confer resistance of cancer cells
to current anticancer therapies (1, 2). Targeting critical apoptosis
inhibitors is an attractive new cancer therapeutic strategy (2–4).
Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) are a class of key apoptosis
regulators characterized by the presence of one to three domains
known as baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains (5–7). Among
these IAP proteins, cellular IAP-1 (cIAP-1) and cIAP-2 play a
critical role in regulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
receptor–mediated apoptosis (8–10), and X-linked IAP (XIAP) is

a central regulator of both death receptor–mediated and
mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathways. XIAP inhibits apoptosis by suppressing caspase activity (7, 11–14). Whereas the
third BIR domain (BIR3) of XIAP selectively targets an initiator
caspase-9 (7), the BIR2 domain, together with the linker
immediately preceding it, inhibits effector caspase-3/caspase-7
(12–14). Consistent with their role in inhibition of apoptosis, XIAP
and cIAP-1 were found to be highly expressed in cancers of
diverse tumor types (15–18) and are considered as attractive new
cancer therapeutic targets (19, 20).
Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding protein with low isoelectric point (Smac/
DIABLO) is an endogenous antagonist of IAP proteins (21, 22). In
its dimeric form, Smac via its AVPI tetrapeptide binding motif
interacts with both BIR2 and BIR3 domains in XIAP and abrogates
the inhibition of caspase-3/caspase-7 and caspase-9 by XIAP
(23, 24). Smac also binds to cIAP-1/2 and can cause the degradation
of cIAP-1 (25, 26). Intense research efforts have been devoted to the
design and development of small-molecule Smac mimetics as a
new class of anticancer drugs (4, 27–32). Two types of Smac
mimetics have been reported (i.e., monovalent and bivalent Smac
mimetics). The monovalent compounds are designed to mimic the
binding of a single AVPI binding motif to IAP proteins (27–29),
whereas the bivalent compounds contain two AVPI binding motif
mimetics tethered together through a linker (4, 30–32). Both types
of Smac mimetics have been shown to induce apoptosis in solid
tumor and leukemia cells as single agents (4, 27, 28, 30, 33).
Several recent independent studies have shown that Smac
mimetics induce rapid degradation of cIAP-1/2, which leads to
nuclear factor-nB activation, production and secretion of TNFa,
and TNFa-dependent induction of apoptosis (31, 32, 34, 35). These
studies established that induction of cIAP-1/2 degradation is a key
early event in apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics, and cIAP-1/2
are critical cellular targets for Smac mimetics. Interestingly,
although Smac mimetics were designed based on the interaction
of XIAP and Smac (4, 27, 28), the role of XIAP in apoptosis
induction by Smac mimetics has not been well defined.
In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action and
therapeutic potential of two different types of Smac mimetics:
monovalent SM-122 and bivalent SM-164 (ref. 30; Fig. 1A). We
showed that removal of cIAP-1/2 by Smac mimetics or small
interfering RNA (siRNA) is not sufficient for TNFa-dependent
apoptosis induction. Using complementary approaches, we showed
that XIAP plays a critical role in inhibiting apoptosis induction by
Smac mimetics. By concurrently targeting cIAP-1/2 for degradation
and efficiently antagonizing XIAP, bivalent SM-164 is an extremely
potent inducer of apoptosis in tumor cells and in xenograft tumor

tissues as a single agent. SM-164 effectively inhibits tumor growth
and is capable of achieving tumor regression, but causes no toxicity
in normal mouse tissues. This study provides further insights into
the mechanism of action for Smac mimetics and regulation of
apoptosis by IAPs. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that SM164 is a promising new anticancer drug for further evaluation and
development.

Cell lines and cell culture. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, SK-OV-3
ovarian cancer, and MALME-3M melanoma cell lines were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin at 37jC in 5% CO2. Isogenic XIAP wild-type (XIAP+/+)
and XIAP knockout (XIAP / ) HCT-116 colon cancer cell lines were a kind
gift from Dr. Fred Bunz (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Jurkat
cell lines transfected with vector control or XIAP plasmid were a kind gift
from Dr. Colin Duckett (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI).
Cell growth, cell death, and apoptosis. Cell growth was evaluated by a
WST-8 assay (Dojindo) as described previously (30). Cell viability was
quantitated by microscopic examination in a trypan blue exclusion assay.
Apoptosis analysis was done using an Annexin V/propidium iodide
apoptosis detection kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Western blot analysis. Cells and xenograft tumor tissues were lysed
using radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (PBS containing 1%
NP40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 1 Amol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet per
10 mL on ice for 20 min, and lysates were then cleared by centrifugation
before protein concentration determination using the Bio-Rad protein
assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were
electrophoresed onto 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Following blocking in 5% milk,
membranes were incubated with a specific primary antibody, washed, and

incubated with horseradish peroxidase–linked secondary antibody (Amersham). The signals were visualized with the chemiluminescent horseradish
peroxidase antibody detection reagent (Denville Scientific). When indicated,
the blots were stripped and reprobed with a different antibody.
RNA interference. SiRNA was used to knock down caspase-3, caspase-8,
caspase-9, XIAP, cIAP-1 (Dhamarcon Research, Inc.), and cIAP-2 (BD
Biosciences). Nontargeting control siRNA was purchased from Ambion.
Transfections were done using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in the
reverse manner according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5 to
10 nmol siRNA and 5 AL Lipofectamine RNAiMAX were mixed in each well
of six-well plates for 20 min, followed by growing 3  105 cells in the siRNA
mix for 24 to 48 h; knockdown efficacy was examined with Western blotting.
Transfected cells were treated as indicated.
Measurement of TNFA concentration. Secreted TNFa concentrations
were determined in 200 AL of cell culture medium using the Quantikine HS
Human TNFa ELISA kit (R&D Systems). The assay was done according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
In vivo pharmacodynamic characterization. For in vivo pharmacodynamic studies, the MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor model was used.
To develop xenograft tumors, 5  106 MDA-MB-231 cancer cells with
Matrigel were injected s.c. on the dorsal side of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice from Charles River, one tumor per mouse. Mice
bearing MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors were treated with a single i.v. dose
of SM-164 at 5 mg/kg, Taxotere at 7.5 mg/kg, or vehicle control. Tumor
tissues and normal mouse tissues were harvested at indicated time points.
Tumor tissues were analyzed by Western blotting to examine levels of cIAP1 and XIAP, caspase processing, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
cleavage in tumor tissues. Tumor and normal mouse tissues were examined
by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) staining, as described in Supplementary Methods, to
detect apoptosis induction and by H&E staining for histopathologic change.
All animal experiments were done under the guidelines of the University of
Michigan Committee for Use and Care of Animals.
In vivo antitumor efficacy study. SCID mice (8–10 per group) bearing
MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors were treated i.v. with 1 and 5 mg/kg of SM164 or 7.5 mg/kg of Taxotere or vehicle control daily, 5 d/wk for 2 wk.
Tumor sizes and animal weights were measured thrice a week. Data are
represented as mean tumor volumes F SE.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were done by two-way ANOVA
and unpaired two-tailed t test, using Prism (version 4.0, GraphPad). P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results
Smac mimetics bind to multiple IAP proteins with high
affinities. SM-122 was designed as a nonpeptidic mimetic of the
Smac AVPI peptide, and SM-164 as a bivalent Smac mimetic
containing two SM-122 analogues tethered together by a chemical
linker (Fig. 1A; ref. 30). SM-123 and SM-173 were designed as much
less potent monovalent and bivalent control compounds, respectively (Fig. 1A; ref. 30).
The binding affinities of SM-164 and SM-122 to XIAP, cIAP-1, and
cIAP-2 proteins were determined using fluorescence-polarization
based assays (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Figs. S1–S3). SM-164 and
SM-122 have K i values of 0.56 and 182 nmol/L, respectively, to XIAP
protein containing both BIR2 and BIR3 domains (Fig. 1B). SM-164
and SM-122 have K i values of 0.31 and 2.7 nmol/L, respectively, to
cIAP-1 protein containing both BIR2 and BIR3 domains (Fig. 1B).
Because we were unable to obtain soluble cIAP-2 protein
containing both BIR2 and BIR3 domains, we evaluated the binding
affinities of our Smac mimetics to cIAP-2 BIR3-only protein. SM164 and SM-122 bind to cIAP-2 BIR3 protein with K i values of 1.1
and 1.9 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1B). Hence, bivalent SM-164 is
300 times more potent than the monovalent SM-122 for binding
to XIAP and is 9 times more potent than SM-122 for binding to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

cIAP-1. SM-122 and SM-164 have similar high binding affinities to
cIAP-2. The monovalent control compound, SM-123, is 100 to 1,000
times less potent than SM-122, and SM-173 is 1,000 times less
potent than SM-164, for binding to these IAP proteins (Fig. 1B).
Because XIAP functions as a potent antagonist of caspase-3/
caspase-7 (12–14), we evaluated SM-164 and SM-122 for their
ability to antagonize XIAP in cell-free functional assays. Recombinant XIAP containing linker-BIR2-BIR3 (residues 120–356) effectively inhibited the activity of caspase-3/caspase-7 in a dosedependent manner and achieved complete inhibition at 50 nmol/L
(Fig. 1C). Both SM-164 and SM-122 dose-dependently antagonized
XIAP and promoted caspase activity, but SM-164 was 60 times
more potent than SM-122 (Fig. 1C). SM-123 and SM-173 had
minimal effect in this functional assay up to 100 Amol/L (Fig. 1C).
Thus, these biochemical data show that the major difference
between bivalent SM-164 and monovalent SM-122 is their potency
in targeting XIAP. This is consistent with our previous study that
SM-164 is >100 times more potent than SM-122 in competing off a
biotinylated Smac mimetic to cellular XIAP in an immunoprecipitation pull-down assay (30).
Smac mimetics induce caspase-8– and caspase-3–dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. Smac mimetics were found to be
effective in induction of apoptosis as single agents in a number of
tumor cell lines (data not shown). We selected the MDA-MB-231
breast cancer, SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer, and MALME-3M melanoma cell lines as representative sensitive models for detailed
studies.
Both SM-164 and SM-122 induced apoptosis and cell death in
each of these three cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner,
but SM-164 was much more potent than SM-122 (Fig. 2A and B;
Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6). For example, treatment with SM164 at 1 nmol/L for 12 hours induced 32%, 33%, and 37% of the
MDA-MB-231, SK-OV-3 and MALME-3M cells to undergo apoptosis, respectively (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Figs. S5A and S6A).
Western blot analysis further showed that SM-164 markedly
decreased the levels of procaspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and
pro-PARP and increased the levels of processed caspase-8, caspase9, and caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in all the three cell lines at 1 to
10 nmol/L (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Figs. S5C and S6B). SM-164 at
1 nmol/L was as effective as SM-122 at 1,000 nmol/L in induction
of apoptosis, cell death, caspase processing, and PARP cleavage.
Furthermore, SM-164 induced caspase processing and PARP
cleavage in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To examine the role of caspase-8, caspase-3, and caspase-9 in
apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics, we used siRNA against
these caspases in MDA-MB-231 and SK-OV-3 cancer cell lines.
Knockdown of caspase-3 and caspase-8 markedly attenuated the
activity of both SM-164 and SM-122, whereas knockdown of
caspase-9 had a minimal effect (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S5D).
In addition, Z-IETD-FMK, a selective caspase-8 inhibitor, and
Z-DEVD-FMK, a selective caspase-3/caspase-7 inhibitor, markedly
inhibited the activity of both Smac mimetics (Fig. 2E; Supplementary Fig. S5E). Hence, although these three caspases are all
processed, only caspase-8 and caspase-3 play a crucial role in
apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics and caspase-9 seems to
have a minimal role, consistent with a previous study (34).
Smac mimetics induce TNFA-dependent apoptosis. Recent
studies have shown that Smac mimetics induce apoptosis in
tumor cells through a TNFa-dependent pathway (31, 32, 34, 35).
Indeed, these sensitive cancer cell lines secreted detectable levels
of TNFa in the cell culture medium without Smac mimetic

Figure 2. Monovalent and bivalent
Smac mimetics induce apoptosis in the
MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line in a
caspase-3– and caspase-8–dependent
manner. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
as indicated. Apoptosis was analyzed
by propidium iodide (PI )/Annexin V double
staining using flow cytometry (A); cell
viability was determined by trypan blue dye
exclusion assay (B ); and cleavage of
caspases and PARP was analyzed by
Western blotting (C ). D, cells were
transfected with siRNA against caspase-3,
caspase-8, and caspase-9 for 48 h,
followed by treatment with SM-164
(middle ) or SM-122 (right ) for 48 h.
Knockdown efficacy was examined by
Western blotting and cell growth inhibitory
activity by a WST assay. E, cells were
treated with Z-DEVD-FMK (25 Amol/L) or
Z-IETD-FMK (25 Amol/L) for 1 h, followed
by treatment with a Smac mimetic for

treatment, and the secretion of TNFa was further enhanced by
SM-164 and SM-122 (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B). Furthermore, cell death induction by SM-164 and SM-122 was effectively
blocked by a TNFa, but not by a TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand neutralizing antibody (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S7C
and D), indicating that apoptosis induction by both SM-164 and
SM-122 is TNFa dependent.
To explore whether the resistance of cancer cells to Smac
mimetics is due to the lack of secreted TNFa, we examined the
levels of secreted TNFa. All resistant cancer cell lines tested, such
as the MDA-MB-453 breast, DU-145 prostate, and MDA-MB-435
melanoma cancer cell lines, had undetectable levels of TNFa in the
cell culture medium (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Both SM-164 and
SM-122 also failed to induce detectable levels of TNFa in these
resistant cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S7B and data not
shown). However, addition of exogenous TNFa can significantly
enhance the activity of these Smac mimetics, especially for SM-164,
in resistant cancer cell lines such as HCT116 and MDA-MB-453
(Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S7E). These data indicated that the
secreted TNFa is essential for the activity of Smac mimetics as
single agents.

Both SM-164 and SM-122 induce rapid cIAP-1 degradation
in cancer cells. Consistent with previous studies (31, 32, 34), both
SM-122 and SM-164 effectively and potently induced cIAP-1
degradation in sensitive cancer cell lines (Fig. 3C–E; Supplementary
Fig. S8). SM-164 at 1 nmol/L for 60 minutes reduced cIAP-1
markedly and at 10 to 100 nmol/L to undetectable levels, and SM122 effectively induced degradation of cIAP-1 at 10 to 100 nmol/L
(Figs. 3C and E and 4A and B; Supplementary Fig. S8A). Induction
of cIAP-1 degradation by both compounds was very rapid,
occurring within 5 to 10 minutes of drug treatment (Fig. 3D and
E; Supplementary Fig. S8B and C). SM-164 and SM-122 also
induced rapid cIAP-1 degradation in resistant cancer cell lines
(Fig. 3E; Supplementary Fig. S9A and B). MG-132, a proteasome
inhibitor, effectively blocked cIAP-1 degradation by SM-122 and
SM-164 in both sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines (Fig. 3E;
Supplementary Fig. S8C), indicating that cIAP-1 degradation by
SM-122 and SM-164 is proteasome mediated, consistent with the
observation for other Smac mimetics (31, 32). The levels of XIAP
protein in MDA-MB-231 and SK-OV-3 cancer cell lines were also
reduced on treatment with SM-164 (Fig. 3D; Supplementary
Fig. S8B). However, the reduction of XIAP took place at the

12- to 24-hour time points, several hours after robust apoptosis
induction, suggesting that degradation of XIAP is not required for
apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics.
Removal of cIAP-1/2 alone is not sufficient to induce TNFAdependent apoptosis. We observed that SM-122 at 100 nmol/L
markedly decreased the levels of cIAP-1 (Figs. 3C and E and 4A and
B; Supplementary Fig. S8A and C) and cIAP-2 (Fig. 4A and B), but
induced minimal cell death in each sensitive cell line at this
concentration (Figs. 2B and 4A and B; Supplementary Figs. S5B
and S6B), suggesting that removal of cIAP-1/2 alone by Smac
mimetics may not be sufficient for apoptosis induction.
To investigate whether the lack of apoptosis induction by SM122 at 100 nmol/L is due to insufficient levels of secreted TNFa,
we treated cells with an excess amount of exogenous TNFa in combination with SM-122. Addition of exogenous TNFa only had
minimal effect on cell killing by SM-122 (Fig. 4A and B), indicating
that the lack of robust apoptosis induction by SM-122 at 100 nmol/L
is not simply due to insufficient amount of secreted TNFa.
Furthermore, efficient knockdown of cIAP-1 or cIAP-2 by siRNA,
individually or together, had little effect on cell death in the MDAMB-231 and SK-OV-3 cell lines, with or without exogenous TNFa
(Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S10). Taken together, our data show
that removal of cIAP-1/2 is not sufficient to achieve robust
TNFa-dependent cell killing.

Figure 3. Smac mimetics induce TNFa-dependent apoptosis and cIAP-1
degradation. A, MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with or without TNFa- or
TRAIL- blocking antibody, followed by treatment with Smac mimetics. Cell
viability was determined with trypan blue assay. B, HCT116 colon cancer cells
were treated with SM-164 alone, TNFa alone, or the combination for 48 h. Cell
growth inhibition was determined by a WST assay. C and D, MDA-MB-231 cells
were treated with Smac mimetics as indicated and the levels of cIAP-1 and XIAP
were examined by Western blotting. E, MDA-MB-231 or HCT116 cells treated
with or without MG-132, followed by the treatment with 100 nmol/L of SM-122 or
SM-164. The levels of cIAP-1 were examined by Western blotting.

XIAP is a critical cellular target for Smac mimetics. Caspase3 plays a crucial role in apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics
(Fig. 2D and E; Supplementary Fig. S5D and E; ref. 34). Because
XIAP binds to and inhibits caspase-3, we reasoned that the
inhibition of caspase-3 by XIAP must be relieved for efficient
apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics and XIAP is a critical
cellular target for Smac mimetics.
To investigate the role of XIAP in apoptosis induction by Smac
mimetics, we knocked down XIAP in sensitive cancer cell lines.
Because XIAP knockdown can attenuate the production and
secretion of TNFa (Supplementary Fig. S11A; ref. 36), exogenous
TNFa was added in these XIAP knockdown experiments. The
results showed that in all three cancer cell lines, efficient
knockdown of XIAP by siRNA dramatically sensitized cancer cells
to SM-122 in the presence of exogenous TNFa (Fig. 5A ;
Supplementary Fig. S11B and C). For example, whereas SM-122 at
100 nmol/L in combination with TNFa killed 25% of the MDA-MB231 cells when control siRNA was used, the same combination killed
75% of the cells when XIAP was knocked down. These data showed
that degradation of cIAP-1/2 by SM-122 and down-regulation of
XIAP by siRNA are highly effective in induction of TNFa-dependent
apoptosis. These data further suggested that SM-122 at 100 nmol/L
effectively induced cIAP-1/2 degradation, but is ineffective in
antagonizing cellular XIAP in these cancer cells, consistent with its
relatively weak functional antagonism against XIAP (Fig. 1C).
However, SM-122 at higher concentrations was still capable of
inducing robust cell death in these sensitive cancer cell lines
(Fig. 2B; Supplementary Figs. S5B and S6B), indicating that SM-122
can still effectively antagonize cellular XIAP but higher concentrations are needed, consistent with the functional data (Fig. 1C).
In sharp contrast, SM-164 at 3 to 10 nmol/L effectively induced
cell death with or without TNFa in all these sensitive cancer cell
lines (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S11B and C). Furthermore,
knockdown of XIAP only modestly sensitized the cancer cells to
SM-164 in the presence of exogenous TNFa in these sensitive
cancer cell lines. These data suggested that SM-164 at these
concentrations not only efficiently induces marked cIAP-1
degradation but also effectively antagonizes cellular XIAP. This is
consistent with our binding and functional data that SM-164 binds
to XIAP with a very high affinity and is an ultrapotent antagonist of
XIAP (Fig. 1B and C).
Knockout of XIAP sensitizes cancer cells to Smac mimetics
for TNFA-dependent apoptosis induction. To complement the
siRNA experiments and to more precisely define the role of XIAP in
TNFa-dependent apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics, we used
HCT116 XIAP+/+ and XIAP / isogenic cell lines (37). Because both
these cell lines were resistant to SM-122 and SM-164 as single
agents (Supplementary Fig. S9A), we investigated the role of XIAP
using Smac mimetics in combination with TNFa. SM-122 at 100 to
1,000 nmol/L effectively induced cIAP-1 degradation in both cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S9A, bottom). The combination of SM-122
at 100 to 1,000 nmol/L with exogenous TNFa had a modest effect
in induction of caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and cell
growth inhibition in the HCT-116 XIAP+/+ cell line (Fig. 5B). In
contrast, the same combination was highly effective in the isogenic
XIAP / cell line in induction of robust caspase-3 activation and
strong PARP cleavage and in inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 5B).
These data clearly showed that XIAP strongly attenuated TNFadependent apoptosis induction by SM-122 in the HCT116 cells and
knockout of XIAP dramatically sensitized the cells to SM-122 in
combination with TNFa.

A Novel Bivalent Smac Mimetic Induces Tumor Regression

Figure 4. Removal of cIAP-1/2 alone is not sufficient to induce robust TNFa-dependent apoptosis. MDA-MB-231 (A) and SK-OV-3 (B) cell lines were treated with
SM-122 alone, TNFa alone, or the combination for 24 h. The levels of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 were examined by Western blotting and cell viability was determined by
trypan blue assay. MDA-MB-231 (C ) and SK-OV-3 (D ) cell lines were transfected with siRNA against cIAP-1, cIAP-2, both cIAP-1 and cIAP-2, or control siRNA for
48 h, followed by treatment with TNFa for 24 h.The levels of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 were examined by Western blotting and cell viability was determined by trypan
blue assay.

SM-164 effectively induced cIAP-1 degradation at 10 to
100 nmol/L in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S9A). The
combination of SM-164 at these concentrations with TNFa was
effective in induction of caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage
and in inhibition of cell growth in the XIAP+/+ cell line (Fig. 5B).
Although knockout of XIAP sensitized the HCT116 cells to SM164 in combination with TNFa, the effect was much less than
that observed with the combination of SM-122 with TNFa
(Fig. 5B).
Overexpression of XIAP renders cancer cells resistant to
TNFA-dependent apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics. We
next investigated the effect of XIAP overexpression in cancer cells
on TNFa-dependent apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics.
Because stable transfection of XIAP in those sensitive cancer cell
lines was unsuccessful, we used the previously well-characterized
XIAP stably transfected Jurkat leukemia cell line (XIAP-JK) and its
vector control cell line (VEC-JK; ref. 38). The VEC-JK cell line with
low expression of XIAP was sensitive to SM-122 or SM-164 in
combination with TNFa(Fig. 5C). In striking contrast, the XIAP-JK
cell line with high levels of XIAP expression became extremely
resistant to the combination of SM-122 with TNFa. For instance,
whereas SM-122 at 100 and 1,000 nmol/L efficiently and rapidly
degraded cIAP-1 in XIAP-JK cells (Supplementary Fig. S9B), it was
ineffective in induction of apoptosis in combination with TNFa
(Fig. 5C). Moreover, although the combination of SM-164 with
TNFa was capable of inducing apoptosis in the XIAP-JK cell line, it
was much less effective than in the VEC-JK cell line. These data
show that overexpression of XIAP effectively attenuates TNFadependent apoptosis induction by both SM-164 and SM-122 but
with a stronger effect on SM-122.
Collectively, the data obtained using complementary approaches
provide strong evidence that XIAP plays a key role in attenuating

apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics. Because bivalent SM-164 is
a more potent antagonist of XIAP than monovalent SM-122, it
exhibits much stronger potency than SM-122 in TNFa-dependent
apoptosis induction.
SM-164 rapidly degrades cIAP-1 and displays strong in vivo
antitumor activity. To further investigate its therapeutic potential
and in vivo mechanism, we evaluated SM-164 in the MDA-MB-231
xenograft model in mice.
SM-164 induced rapid cIAP-1 degradation and robust apoptosis
in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor tissues (Fig. 6A). A single dose
of SM-164 at 5 mg/kg markedly decreased the level of cIAP-1
protein within 1 hour and the effect lasted for at least 24 hours.
Robust activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 and
cleavage of PARP were observed at the 3-hour time point and
persisted for 24 hours. A TUNEL assay further showed that SM-164
induced strong apoptosis in tumor tissues as early as the 3-hour
time point, and more than 50% of tumor cells were TUNEL positive
at the 6-hour time point (Fig. 6C), consistent with the strong
caspase processing and PARP cleavage at this time point (Fig. 6A).
The strong apoptosis induction by SM-164 was still evident at
the 24-hour time point. H&E staining showed that SM-164 caused
profound damage to tumor tissues (Fig. 6D). In contrast to
the strong apoptosis induction and damage in xenograft tumor
tissues, SM-164 had no effect on all the normal mouse tissues
examined, including highly proliferative tissues such as the
small intestine, stomach, liver, and spleen (Fig. 6D; Supplementary
Fig. S12A and B).
Using the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model, we also examined
SM-122 for its ability to induce cIAP-1 degradation and apoptosis
in tumor tissues in vivo. Administration of a single dose of SM-122
at 100 mg/kg i.v., a near maximum tolerated dose, effectively
induced cIAP-1 degradation in tumor tissues but had minimal

effect on PARP cleavage (Fig. 6B). Hence, our in vivo data further
indicated that cIAP-1 degradation is not sufficient for apoptosis
induction.
We next evaluated SM-164 for its ability to inhibit tumor growth.
Consistent with its potent activity in apoptosis induction in
xenograft tumor tissues, SM-164 was highly effective in inhibition
of tumor growth and capable of achieving tumor regression in the
MDA-MB-231 xenograft model (Fig. 6E). Treatment with SM-164 at
1 mg/kg completely inhibited tumor growth during the treatment.
Treatment with SM-164 at 5 mg/kg reduced the tumor volume
from 147 F 54 mm3 at the beginning of the treatment (day 25)
to 54 F 32 mm3 at the end of the treatment (day 36), a reduction
of 65%. The strong antitumor activity by SM-164 was long lasting
and not transient. Importantly, no significant weight loss or other
sign of toxicity was observed for mice treated with SM-164 at 1 or
5 mg/kg (Supplementary Fig. S13). Treatment with Taxotere at
7.5 mg/kg was effective in inhibition of tumor growth, as compared

with the control treatment, but failed to achieve tumor regression.
SM-164 at 5 mg/kg is statistically more effective than Taxotere at
the end of the treatment (P < 0.01) or when the tumor size in the
control group reached 750 mm3 (P < 0.02). Taken together, our data
showed that SM-164 has a very strong in vivo antitumor activity at
nontoxic dose schedules.

Discussion
Several recent studies showed that Smac mimetics induce rapid
degradation of cIAP-1/2, and this leads to activation of nuclear
factor nB and production and secretion of TNFa, resulting in
TNFa-dependent apoptosis induction (31, 32, 34). These studies
establish that degradation of cIAP-1/2 by Smac mimetics is
essential for apoptosis induction. Our study, however, clearly
showed that removal of cIAP-1/2 alone either by a Smac mimetic
or by siRNA is not sufficient for induction of TNFa-dependent

Figure 5. XIAP plays an important role in mediating TNFa-dependent apoptosis induced by Smac mimetics. A, MDA-MB-231 cell line was transfected with XIAP
siRNA for 48 h, followed by the treatment of SM-122 or SM-164 in combination with TNFa (10 ng/mL) for 48 h. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye
exclusion. B, HCT116 XIAP+/+ and XIAP / cell lines were treated with SM-122 or SM-164 alone or in combination with TNFa (0.1 ng/mL) as indicated. PARP cleavage
and activation of caspase-3 were examined by Western blotting and cell growth inhibition by a WST assay. C, Jurkat cell lines were treated with SM-122, SM-164,
TNFa (300 ng/mL) alone, or the combination of SM-122 or SM-164 with TNFa for 24 h. Apoptosis was analyzed by propidium iodide staining/Annexin V double staining
using flow cytometry.

A Novel Bivalent Smac Mimetic Induces Tumor Regression

Figure 6. SM-164 induces rapid cIAP-1 degradation and robust apoptosis in tumor tissues and achieves tumor regression, but causes minimal toxicity to mouse
tissues. A, SCID mice (two mice per group) bearing established MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors were treated with a single i.v. dose of SM-164, Taxotere (TXT ), or
vehicle (VEH ). Tumor tissues were harvested at the indicated time points. Degradation of cIAP-1 and XIAP, activation of caspases, and PARP cleavage in tumor
tissues were analyzed by Western blotting. B, SCID mice (two mice per group) bearing established MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors were treated with a single i.v. dose
of SM-122 or vehicle. Tumor tissues were harvested at the indicated time points. cIAP-1 degradation and PARP cleavage in tumor tissues were analyzed by
Western blotting. Tumor tissues harvested from mice treated with SM-164 were included as controls. C, apoptosis by TUNEL staining. To score apoptosis, at least 1,000
cells were counted under a microscope. D, SCID mice (two to three mice per group) bearing established MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors were treated with a single
dose of SM-164 (5 mg/kg, i.v.) or vehicle. Tumor and mouse tissues were harvested at the 24-h time point and examined by H&E staining. Xenograft tumor
tissues treated with SM-164 were shown with cell shrinkage, nuclear pyknosis, and chromatin condensation. E, SCID mice (8–10 per group) bearing established
MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors were treated i.v. with SM-164, Taxotere, or vehicle. Points, mean tumor volume; bars, SE.

apoptosis in both sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines (Fig. 4;
Supplementary Fig. S14).
Using several complementary approaches, we showed that in
addition to cIAP-1/2, XIAP plays a major role in regulating
TNFa-dependent apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics. Downregulation of XIAP by siRNA or XIAP knockout significantly
sensitizes tumor cells to apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics
(Fig. 5A and B; Supplementary Fig. S11B and C). Conversely,
overexpression of XIAP markedly attenuates the activity (Fig. 5C).
The important role of XIAP in regulating apoptosis induction by
Smac mimetics is consistent with the notion that XIAP potently
inhibits caspase-3 (12, 14) and caspase-3 plays a crucial role in
TNFa-dependent apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics (Fig. 2D

www.aacrjournals.org

and E; Supplementary Fig. S5D and E; ref. 34). Hence, cIAP-1/2
and XIAP are the major and independent blockades in TNFadependent apoptosis by Smac mimetics, and concurrent removal
of these blockades is needed to achieve efficient apoptosis
induction in tumor cells.
The requirement that both cIAP-1/2 and XIAP be removed for
efficient apoptosis induction by Smac mimetics also explains the
differences in the cellular activities of bivalent SM-164 and
monovalent SM-122. Because bivalent SM-164 contains two ‘‘AVPI’’
binding motifs and simultaneously interacts with both the BIR2
and BIR3 domains in XIAP (30), it is an extremely potent
antagonist of XIAP (Fig. 1C). Our data strongly suggest that
bivalent SM-164 at concentrations of 1 to 10 nmol/L not only

efficiently induces cIAP-1 degradation but also effectively antagonizes cellular XIAP, thus leading to robust TNFa-dependent
apoptosis induction.
In comparison, monovalent SM-122 binds to XIAP BIR3 with a
high affinity but to BIR2 with a low affinity (30). Because the BIR2
domain, together with the immediate preceding linker, binds to
and inhibits caspase-3 (12, 14), SM-122 is a much weaker
antagonist of XIAP than SM-164 in relieving caspase-3 inhibition
(Fig. 1C). However, SM-164 is only nine times more potent than
SM-122 for binding to cIAP-1 protein containing both BIR2 and
BIR3 domains. Furthermore, SM-164 and SM-122 bind to cIAP-1
protein containing only the BIR3 domain with essentially the same
high affinities (Supplementary Fig. S3; Fig. 1B). Both compounds
bind to cIAP-1 BIR2-containing protein with only millimolar
affinities (data not shown). These data indicate that unlike with
XIAP, both Smac mimetics interact with cIAP-1 primarily through
the BIR3 domain. Consistently, SM-164 is only modestly more
potent than SM-122 in induction of cIAP-1 degradation in cells.
Therefore, our present study suggests that the much higher potency
of SM-164 in antagonizing XIAP than SM-122 primarily accounts
for the 1,000-fold difference in their ability to induce TNFadependent apoptosis in tumor cells.
Our study indicated that for robust induction of TNFadependent apoptosis, a Smac mimetic must be capable of not
only targeting cIAP-1/2 for degradation but also effectively
antagonizing XIAP to remove inhibition of caspase-3. Because
most of monovalent Smac mimetics have been designed to target
the BIR3 domain of XIAP (27–29), our data suggest that for the
design of more effective monovalent Smac mimetics, their potency
against XIAP BIR2 domain needs to be improved.
To investigate if SM-164 is selectively toxic against tumor cells,
we evaluated SM-164 alone or in combination with TNFa against
a panel of normal human cells (Supplementary Fig. S15). These
include normal human fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial
cells. Our data showed that SM-164 has no or minimal toxicity,
either alone or in combination with TNFa against these normal

human cells. Of interest, all the normal cells examined have very
low expression of cIAP-1, as compared with tumor cell lines,
suggesting that normal cells do not depend on cIAP-1 for blocking
apoptotic signals.
Our in vivo data clearly show that a single dose of SM-164 is
effective in induction of rapid cIAP-1 degradation, caspase activation, and strong apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 tumor tissues,
while having no toxicity to any of the normal mouse tissues examined. Hence, SM-164 is selectively toxic to tumor tissues versus
normal tissues. SM-164 is effective in inhibition of tumor growth
and is capable of achieving partial tumor regression.
In summary, our present study provides clear evidence that
cIAP-1/2 and XIAP are crucial and independent blockades that
need to be concurrently removed by Smac mimetics for efficient
TNFa-dependent apoptosis to proceed. By concurrently targeting
cIAP-1/2 and XIAP, SM-164 is a highly effective inducer of
apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SM164 is selectively toxic to tumor cells in vitro and to tumor
tissues in vivo. SM-164 warrants extensive testing as a new
anticancer drug.
