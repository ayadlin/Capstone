BACKGROUND: The treatment of older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using standard intensive chemotherapy has been
associated with poor outcomes. Effective, less toxic therapies are needed to achieve and maintain durable remissions. METHODS:
One hundred eighteen patients with newly diagnosed AML (median age, 68 years; range, 60-81 years) were treated with a regimen of
clofarabine and low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) alternating with decitabine (DAC). The induction consisted of intravenous clofarabine at
20 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5 combined with subcutaneous LDAC at 20 mg twice daily on days 1 to 10. Responding patients were then
treated with a prolonged consolidation/maintenance regimen consisting of cycles of clofarabine plus LDAC alternating with cycles of
DAC. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 68%. The complete remission (CR) rate was 60% overall, 71% for patients with a diploid
karyotype, and 50% for patients with an adverse karyotype. The median overall survival (OS) was 11.1 months for all patients and 18.5
months for those achieving a CR/complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). The median relapse-free survival for
patients achieving a CR/CRp was 14.1 months. According to a multivariate analysis, only adverse cytogenetics and a white blood cell
count  10 3 109/L predicted worse OS. The regimen was well tolerated with 4- and 8-week mortality rates of 3% and 7%, respectively.
The most common nonhematologic adverse events were nausea, elevated liver enzymes, and rash. CONCLUSIONS: The lower intensity, prolonged-therapy program of clofarabine and LDAC alternating with DAC is well tolerated and highly effective in older patients

INTRODUCTION
Although intensive chemotherapy with anthracyclines and higher doses of cytarabine (araC) are considered standard treatment for most younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a significant proportion of patients older than 60
years may not benefit from this approach.1,2 Along with higher rates of comorbidities and organ dysfunction in older
patients, AML in this population is associated with adverse features, lower rates of complete remission (CR), shorter durations of CR, and higher early mortality. Because most patients with AML are older than 60 years, developing safer, effective regimens is a priority.
Clofarabine is a purine nucleoside analogue that is approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory pediatric
acute lymphoblastic leukemia after at least 2 prior regimens, but it has demonstrated activity in AML. An initial phase 1
dose-escalation study of single-agent clofarabine determined the maximum tolerated dose in leukemia to be 40 mg/m2 for
5 days, with hepatotoxicity being the dose-limiting toxicity.3 Subsequent studies have shown lower doses to be safe and

effective in patients with AML.4,5 On the basis of further
studies confirming the activity of clofarabine in AML and
the finding of synergy in combination with araC, clofarabine was successfully combined with varying doses of
araC in relapsed and previously untreated patients.6-9 In a
randomized study of clofarabine with or without lowdose cytarabine (LDAC) in older patients (60 years old)
with newly diagnosed AML, we previously demonstrated
a favorable safety profile and an improved CR rate (63%
vs 31%, P 5 .025) for the combination.7 However, there
was no significant difference in overall survival (OS).
This lack of an OS benefit despite a reduction of
early mortality and an achievement of higher rates of CR
highlights the importance of maintaining remissions with
prolonged, lower intensity therapy, particularly in
patients who are not candidates for allogeneic stem cell
transplantation. To build on our prior experience with
clofarabine plus LDAC and to improve the postremission consolidation strategy, a prolonged, alternating
combination of clofarabine plus LDAC alternating with
decitabine (DAC) was developed. In our initial experience with 59 patients  60 years old who were treated
with this regimen, we observed a CR rate of 58% and
improved median relapse-free survival (RFS) of 14.1
months in comparison with historical controls.10 Here
we report on the final results of this phase 2 trial with
mature follow-up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria

This open-label, prospective phase 2 study (protocol
2007-0039) was approved by the institutional review
board of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center, and all patients provided written informed consent according to institutional guidelines. The study was
conducted in concordance with the declaration of
Helsinki.
Patients who were 60 years old, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status  2, and
had previously untreated AML (non-M3) or high-risk
(marrow blasts  10% or risk  intermediate-2 [International Prognostic Scoring System]) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were eligible for enrollment. Other
eligibility criteria included adequate hepatic (serum
bilirubin  1.5 times the upper limit of normal and alanine
aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase  2.5
times the upper limit of normal) and renal function
(creatinine  1.5 mg/dL) and the ability to sign informed
consent. Pregnant patients and those with an ejection

fraction < 40% were excluded. Patients with prior exposure
to clofarabine or DAC were also not eligible.
Treatment Plan

The treatment plan consisted of a rotating schedule of 3
cycles of clofarabine plus LDAC (cycle A) alternating with
3 cycles of DAC (cycle B) for up to 18 cycles as previously
described (Fig. 1).10 A treatment cycle was defined as a
minimum of 28 days. The induction therapy (cycle 1)
consisted of intravenous clofarabine at 20 mg/m2 over the
course of 1 to 2 hours on days 1 to 5 and subcutaneous
araC at 20 mg twice daily on days 1 to 10. On the days of
combination treatment (ie, days 1-5 of induction and
days 1-3 of consolidation cycle A), araC was administered
3 to 6 hours after the start of the clofarabine infusions to
take advantage of their pharmacodynamic interaction.
Patients could receive up to 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy if a CR was not achieved after cycle 1. Patients
achieving a remission could then move onto consolidation
therapy, which consisted of intravenous clofarabine at
20 mg/m2 over the course of 1 to 2 hours on days 1 to 3
and subcutaneous araC at 20 mg twice daily on days 1 to
7 (cycle A) alternating with intravenous DAC at 20 mg/
m2 on days 1 to 5 (cycle B) as described previously.
Patients could receive up to 17 consolidation cycles,
which could be given every 4 to 7 weeks; this depended on
adequate blood count recovery (absolute neutrophil
count  1 3 109/L and platelet count  50 3 109/L) and

the resolution of nonhematologic toxicities to grade 1 or
lower. Dose interruptions and dose modifications were
implemented for grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicities, and missed doses were not made up.
Supportive care was continued in all patients per
institutional guidelines. Myeloid growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor) were permitted if
they were in the best interest of the patient. Prophylactic
broad-spectrum antibiotics were permitted, and all
patients received levofloxacin, fluconazole, and valacyclovir (or their equivalent) during the study. When possible,
the use of nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic agents was
strongly discouraged, and they were to be avoided during
clofarabine administration during all cycles.
Response Criteria

A CR was defined as a normalization of peripheral blood
and bone marrow (BM) with <5% blasts, a peripheral
absolute neutrophil count  1 3 109/L, and a platelet
count  100 3 109/L. A partial response (PR) was
defined as the same blood count recovery for a CR with a
decrease in BM blasts of at least 50% and not more than
6% to 25% abnormal cells in the BM. A complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) was defined
in the same way as a CR except without the recovery of a
platelet count  100 3 109/L.
Statistical Analysis

The primary objective of this phase 2 trial was to determine RFS and OS. RFS was defined as the interval from
the time of the first response (CR or CRp) to the date of
relapse or death, whichever occurred first. CR or CRp
patients who were alive and relapse-free were censored at
the off-study date. OS was measured from the time of initiation on study until death. Interim stopping boundaries
were developed for monitoring efficacy and safety.
Patient characteristics were summarized as frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables and as medians
(ranges) for continuous variables. The Fisher exact test
was used to assess the differences in categorical variables
between patients in various subgroups. The Wilcoxon
rank sum test was used to compare continuous variables.
OS and RFS were estimated with the method of Kaplan
and Meier. A log-rank test was used to compare OS or
RFS between subgroups of patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess
the association between OS or RFS and patient prognostic
factors. Safety data were summarized by category, severity,

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

A total of 118 patients  60 years old with newly diagnosed AML were treated on the protocol with a median
follow-up of 41.4 months. The patients’ baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Their median age was
68 years (range, 60-81 years), and 46 patients (39%) were
70 years old or older. More than half of the patients
(54%) had an antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD)
before their diagnosis of AML, and 15 patients (13%)
received therapy for their AHD before they were enrolled
in the current trial. Thirty-six patients (31%) had received
prior chemotherapy or radiation for a previous (nonmyeloid) malignancy and were considered to have therapyrelated acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML). Pretreatment
karyotype evaluations revealed 45 patients (38%) with a
normal or diploid karyotype, 42 patients (36%) with
abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, and 25
patients (21%) with other abnormalities. Thirty-eight
patients (32%) had a complex karyotype (defined as 3 or
more chromosomal abnormalities). Overall, 41% of the
patients were categorized as having an adverse-risk karyotype. Seven patients (7%) had pretreatment FLT3 mutations, and 11 patients (12%) had NPM1 mutations.

Efficacy

Summaries of overall responses and responses by patient
subgroups are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Patients received
a median of 3 cycles of therapy (range, 1-19). Among the
118 evaluable patients, 71 (60%) achieved CR, 8 (7%)
achieved CRp, and 1 (1%) had a PR for a CR/CRp rate of
67% and an overall response rate (CR 1 CRp 1 PR) of
2378

68%. Patients needed a median of 1 cycle to achieve a
response (range, 1-6). When they were analyzed by subgroup, patients between the ages of 60 and 69 years had a
rate of CR similar to that of patients who were 70 years
old or older. However, patients with a diploid karyotype
had a higher rate of CR (71%), than those with an adverse
karyotype (50%, P 5 .05), those with prior AHD (55%,
P 5 .11), and particularly those treated for prior AHD
(33%, P 5 .01). Sixteen patients (14%) proceeded to
stem cell transplantation.
The median OS for all patients was 11.1 months
(Fig. 2). The median OS for responding patients (CR/
CRp) was 18.5 months, whereas it was 4.2 months for
patients not achieving a CR/CRp (P < .001; Fig. 3). The
median RFS for all patients achieving a CR/CRp was 14.1
months (Fig. 4).

We performed a multivariate analysis to determine
whether specific baseline characteristics predicted OS. A
univariate analysis for OS was first conducted to determine which pretreatment characteristics met the threshold
of significance to be entered into the multivariate model
(Table 4). We included all factors with a P value  .1
from the univariate analysis in the multivariate model;
they included performance status (P 5 .03), a history of
therapy for prior AHD (P 5 .04), t-AML (P 5 .007), cytogenetics (diploid vs adverse; P < .0001), and white
blood cell (WBC) count (P 5 .1). According to the multivariate analysis, the only 2 factors that significantly predicted inferior OS were a WBC count  10 3 109/L
(P 5 .02) and an adverse karyotype (P < .001; Table 4).

(13%). The most common grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic
toxicities were elevated transaminases (11%), elevated bilirubin (5%), elevated creatinine (3%), and rash (2%). Elevations in liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase/
alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin) were mostly transient and responded to interruptions or delays in therapy.
Patients came off therapy for the following reasons:
refractory disease/inadequate response (34%), relapse
(27%), allogeneic stem cell transplantation (14%), completion of all therapy and/or change to a different therapy
(12%), patient or physician choice (8%), infection or
toxicity (3%), development of extramedullary disease
(1%), death with a CR (1%), and prolonged myelosuppression (1%).

Safety and Tolerability

All patients who received any therapy were eligible for toxicity evaluation. Because of the patient population enrolled and the treatment regimen, myelosuppression
occurred in all patients. Nonhematologic, possibly related
adverse events are outlined by frequency and grade in
Table 5. The regimen was well tolerated in this older population with a 4-week mortality rate of only 3%. Most
patients received the first cycle (induction) as inpatients in
a negative air-pressure laminar flow room on the leukemia
floor. Grade 3 and 4 infections were common in this population. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 61% of patients,
and grade 3 or 4 infections were documented in 41%.
Other than these, the most common nonhematologic toxicities were nausea (81%), elevated liver transaminases
(64%), rash (56%), elevated bilirubin (47%), nonspecific
pain (32%), diarrhea (19%), and elevated creatinine

DISCUSSION
Most patients with AML are older than 60 years. The challenge in treating AML in older adults is offering highly
effective therapy that has low rates of toxicity and that translates improved remission rates into improved survival.
Because of lower expected CR rates and a higher likelihood
of increased toxicity, older patients with AML may not
benefit from intensive chemotherapy. We previously evaluated the outcomes of AML patients older than 65 years1
and older than 70 years2 who were treated with intensive
chemotherapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center. In this population, we reported a CR rate
of 45% and a median OS of 4.6 months. The rates of
induction mortality at 4 and 8 weeks were 26% and 36%,
respectively. With the exception of fit older patients with a
favorable karyotype and preserved organ function, we

concluded that most older patients with AML would not
benefit from intensive chemotherapy approaches.
The current study with clofarabine and LDAC alternating with DAC offers a lower intensity approach that
demonstrates a CR/CRp rate of 67% with 4- and 8-week
mortality rates of 3% and 7%, respectively, in a cohort of
patients with a median age of 68 years and several adverse
risk factors. More than half of the patients had prior
AHD, 31% had t-AML, and 32% had a complex karyotype. This therapy translated into a median OS of 11.1
months for the whole cohort, 18.5 months for responding
patients, and an RFS of 14.1 months. The significance of
these data can be examined in the context of other lower
intensity treatment approaches for older patients with
newly diagnosed AML.
Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacytidine (5AZA) and DAC, which were developed for the treatment
of MDS, are regularly applied as lower intensity therapy
in older patients with AML. The activity of 5-AZA was
observed in a post hoc subset analysis of a randomized
phase 3 trial of 5-AZA versus conventional care (CC) in
patients with high-risk MDS.11 In the subset of 113
2380

patients (median age, 70 years) with 20% to 30% blasts
(classified as AML by the World Health Organization),
5-AZA resulted in a response rate of 18% and significant
improvement in median OS in comparison with CC
(24.5 vs 16 months, P 5 .001).11 Subsequent single-arm
studies of 5-AZA have confirmed its activity in older
patients with AML.12-14 In patients with median ages
ranging from 72 to 74 years, these studies have reported
response rates of 33% to 50% and median OS of 3 to
9.4 months.12-14 Notably, none have reproduced the OS
observed in the MDS study. This important difference is
likely related to differences in patient characteristics and,
in particular, to the lower median BM blast percentage
of those patients in the MDS trial (20%-30%). Indeed,
the median BM blast percentage of patients in these trials
ranged from 33% to 42%. The AML-001 trial was
designed to address this question of the efficacy of 5AZA in older patients with AML and BM blasts  30%.
Dombret15 recently presented preliminary results from
this phase 3 study. Similarly to the MDS trial, 488
patients (median age, 75 years) with AML and BM
blasts  30% were randomized to either 5-AZA or CC.
The overall response rate was 28% for 5-AZA and 25%
for CC; this led to a trend toward improved median OS
for patients treated with 5-AZA (10.4 vs 6.5 months,
P 5 .08). Patients in the current study of clofarabine and
LDAC had median BM blasts of 37%, with 77 patients
(65%) having BM blasts  30%, and the outcomes compared favorably to these data.
DAC has been similarly studied in several singlearm studies. In patients with median ages of 72 to 74
years and median BM blasts of 50% to 56%, DAC was
associated with overall response rates of 25% to 26% and
a median OS of 5.5 to 7.7 months.16,17 DAC was also
studied in a phase 3 randomized trial and compared with
treatment choice in 485 older patients (median age, 73
years) with AML and a median BM blast count of
46%.18 In this trial, DAC produced a response rate of
17.8% versus 7.8% for treatment choice, translating into
an improved OS of 7.7 months versus 5 months
(P 5 .037).18 In an effort to further improve response
rates, several groups have studied a 10-day schedule of
DAC instead of the 5-day regimen. Blum et al19 reported
an overall response rate of 64% and a median OS of 55
weeks for 53 patients with a median age of 74 years;
25% had prior AHD, 11% had t-AML, and 30% had a
complex karyotype. The 4- and 8-week mortality rates
were 2% and 15%, respectively.19 Ritchie et al20 used a
10-day schedule of DAC in 52 patients with a median
age of 74 years and reported a CR rate of 40% with a

16 months for responders.20
One of the major goals of our lower intensity
approach in a population of patients who were not ideal
candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation was to
reduce the risk of relapse. The prolonged consolidation/
maintenance therapy was designed with alternating cycles
of different chemotherapy drugs to address this challenge.
First, we hypothesized that alternating 3 cycles of clofarabine/LDAC with 3 cycles of DAC would reduce the development of resistance and thereby prolong the duration
of remission. Second, we recognized the differences in intensity and side-effect profile between cycle A and cycle B.
To deliver up to 18 months of chemotherapy, the alternating cycles would mitigate cumulative toxicities and
preserve longer term tolerance of the regimen. Indeed,
this alternating program achieved a median RFS of 14.1
months with a median follow-up of 41.4 months, and it
compares very favorably to data from previous trials of
hypomethylating agents in this setting.
Although we can examine the response rates, survival, and CR durations across trials and even try to
match patient characteristics to compare similar groups,
one of the major limitations of our study is that it is a
single-arm phase 2 trial without a comparator arm.
Although an earlier report of this trial compared outcomes to historical controls, a randomized trial in older
patients with AML comparing the current regimen with
a standard lower intensity approach would be needed to
confirm the advantage of this regimen. The large cohort
size and the long follow-up allowed us to examine the
impact of baseline patient characteristics on OS. An
advanced performance status, treatment for prior AHD,
a diagnosis of t-AML, an adverse karyotype, and an elevated WBC count were significant negative prognostic
factors in the univariate analysis. However, only adverse
cytogenetics and a WBC count  10 3 109/L were significant in the multivariate analysis, with performance
status having marginal significance.
The regimen was well tolerated. As would be
expected, all patients experienced myelosuppression. In
some patients, prolonged myelosuppression with repeated
cycles was managed with dose delays and dose reductions.
Despite antimicrobial prophylaxis, febrile neutropenia
and documented infections in the setting of neutropenia
were common and occurred in 61% and 41%, respectively. However, these patients were treated with broadspectrum intravenous antibiotics and growth factors when
appropriate, and this led to a low rate of death due to
infection. Elevations in liver transaminases and bilirubin

were also commonly seen, particularly during the
clofarabine-based cycles. However, the elevations were
usually transient, temporally related to drug infusion, and
not clinically significant. Care was taken to avoid the concomitant use of hepatotoxic medications such as antifungal azoles during clofarabine therapy, and serum
chemistries were monitored closely to document improvement. Rash, including hand-foot syndrome, occurred in
more than two-thirds of patients at varying levels of severity and was also related to clofarabine. Supportive care,
including topical moisturizing ointments and low-dose
topical steroids, were regularly used preventatively and in
response to worsening rash. These measures kept the skin
toxicity self-limiting except for the rare cases that required
therapy delay or dose reduction. The lower intensity
approach of this regimen is exemplified by the low early
death rates at 4 and 8 weeks of 3% and 7%, respectively,
despite a CR rate of 60%, a 2-year OS rate of 29%, and a
2-year RFS rate of 36%. For comparison, a higher intensity, high-dose daunorubicin–based approach demonstrated a CR rate of 64% and comparable 2-year OS and
disease-free survival rates of 31% and 30%, respectively,
but at the cost of a 30-day mortality rate of 11%.21
In conclusion, the combination of clofarabine and
LDAC alternating with DAC implemented in a prolonged consolidation/maintenance program is well tolerated and highly effective in older patients with AML.
Further studies expanding this strategy and prospectively
comparing it with existing higher and lower intensity
therapies in older adults are needed.
