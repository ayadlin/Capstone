ABSTRACT
Expression of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3) is elevated in prostate cancer
and its inhibition reduces prostate cancer cell proliferation, in part by reducing
androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, GSK-3 inhibition can also activate signals
that promote cell proliferation and survival, which may preclude the use of GSK-3
inhibitors in the clinic. To identify such signals in prostate cancer, we screened for
changes in transcription factor target DNA binding activity in GSK-3-silenced cells.
Among the alterations was a reduction in AR DNA target binding, as predicted from
previous studies, and an increase in NFκB DNA target binding. Consistent with the
latter, gene silencing of GSK-3 or inhibition using the GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR99021
increased basal NFκB transcriptional activity. Activation of NFκB was accompanied by
an increase in the level of the NFκB family member RelB. Conversely, silencing RelB
reduced activation of NFκB by CHIR99021. Furthermore, the reduction of prostate
cancer cell proliferation by CHIR99021 was potentiated by inhibition of NFκB signaling
using the IKK inhibitor PS1145. Finally, stratification of human prostate tumor gene
expression data for GSK3 revealed an inverse correlation between NFκB-dependent
and androgen-dependent gene expression, consistent with the results from the
transcription factor target DNA binding screen. In addition, there was a correlation
between expression of androgen-repressed NFκB target genes and reduced survival
of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. These findings highlight an association
between GSK-3/AR and NFκB signaling and its potential clinical importance in
metastatic prostate cancer.

activity is regulated by co-activator and co-repressor
proteins and by posttranslational modifications, such as
phosphorylation by kinases [4, 8–11], including GSK-3,
which is important for AR stability, nuclear localization
and transcriptional activity [4, 5, 12]. The mechanism
of action of GSK-3 is however complex and contextdependent, since its overexpression in some cell types
inhibits AR [10, 11] and there are instances where ­GSK-3

inhibitors reduce proliferation of AR-negative PCa cells
[13, 14]. In addition, GSK-3 regulates other signals,
such as those mediated by Wnt and NFκB, which are
themselves linked [15]. Adding further complexity, there
are two GSK-3 isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β that have
different expression profiles in PCa [1]. Knockout studies
have shown that the two isoforms generally compensate
for one another [16]. However, there are examples where
a single isoform has a unique or predominant function
[17, 18]. This is the case in PCa, where GSK-3α is more
important for maintaining AR transcriptional activity
and silencing GSK-3β but not GSK-3α reduces PKB
phosphorylation [1].
In order to identify isoform-specific GSK-3 targets
in PCa, we screened for transcription factors whose
binding to cognate DNA target sequences is altered upon
GSK-3 silencing. We observed reduced binding to an AR
target binding site upon silencing GSK-3α, consistent
with our earlier study [1], and increased binding to an
NFκB target-binding site in cells chronically silenced for
GSK-3β. Further analyses using PCa cell lines and tumor
array data revealed a link between GSK-3 expression and
an inverse correlation between AR and NFκB signaling
pathways. GSK-3 has previously been linked to NFκB
activation [19] and there are a variety of reports on the
mechanisms involved. For example, GSK-3 can inhibit
p65 transcriptional activity [20], increase p105 stability
[21], suppress chromatin accessibility [22] and inhibit
IKK phosphorylation of IκB [23]. On the other hand, there
are many instances where targeted deletion of GSK-3β
inhibits NFκB activity [24–26]. The conclusion from these
apparently conflicting studies is that GSK-3 regulation
of NFκB is highly context-dependent and will only be
understood by carrying out experiments using the cells
and tissues of interest. The studies described in this report
find that acute gene silencing and chemical inhibition
of GSK-3 increase basal NFκB activity in PCa, and that
combined inhibition of GSK-3 and NFκB signaling is
more effective than inhibition of each alone for reducing
PCa cell proliferation.

cells transiently transfected with shRNAs specific for
GSK-3α or GSK-3β. Acute GSK-3α silencing reduced
the binding activity of AR to its DNA target element
(Figures 1A and B), consistent with our previous study [1].
Also in keeping with these results, silencing of GSK-3α
but not of GSK-3β reduced expression of the AR target
gene TMEPA1 [27], but not of AR itself (Figure 1C). In
addition, silencing GSK-3α increased binding activity of
activator protein 2 (AP-2) (Figure 1A), without affecting
expression of TFAP2A (Figure 1C), the major AP-2
family member expressed in 22Rv1 cells, and silencing
GSK-3α and, to a lesser extent, GSK-3β increased binding
activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Figures 1A
and B). We next carried out protein/DNA array screens
using extracts from 22Rv1 cell clones stably silenced for
either GSK-3α or GSK-3β. In contrast to the results from
acute silencing, binding to AR target DNA was slightly
increased in cells stably silenced for GSK-3α (Figures 1D
and F). In addition, the changes in AP-2 and GR binding
activities observed upon acute silencing of GSK-3α were
not seen in stably silenced cells, suggesting that several
changes induced upon acute silencing of GSK-3 are not
maintained in stably silenced cell lines. Several other spots
were reproducibly altered with stable GSK-3α silencing,
namely an increase in binding to the Sp1 binding site
(row 11 columns 1/2), the Stat5/6 binding site (columns
13/14) and the Pbx1 binding site (row 7 columns 15/16),
also observed upon acute silencing of GSK-3α. To address
the possibility that stable inhibition of GSK-3 leads to
selection for prostate cancer stem/progenitor-like cells,
as was recently reported for PC3 cells [28], we measured
the expression levels of three genes expressed in 22Rv1derived stem/progenitor cells, SOX2, NANOG and BCRP
[29], in the 22Rv1-derived cell clones. This revealed
small reductions in expression of SOX2 in both GSK3-isoform silenced cell lines, a small increase in NANOG
expression in the GSK-3α-silenced cell line and no
change in expression of BCRP (Figure 1E). These results
suggest that stable inhibition of GSK-3 isoforms does not
lead to selection for prostate cancer stem/progenitor-like
cells. In addition, we observed increased binding to the
NFκB target DNA sequence in cells stably silenced for
GSK-3β (Figures 1D, F), and, consistent with this, NFκBdependent transcription was increased in cell lines stably
silenced for GSK-3β (Figure 1G).

in PCa, we screened for transcription factors whose

GSK-3 silencing in 22Rv1 PCa cells. Since we previously
found differences between the effects of acute and chronic

were carried out using both conditions. In the acute
silencing experiments, we used nuclear extracts from

The observation that stable but not acute silencing of
GSK-3β increased NFκB activity prompted us to determine
the effects of acute silencing on NFκB-dependent
transcription. Acute silencing of single GSK-3 isoforms
did not affect NFκB transcriptional activity (Figure 2A),
consistent with no change in NFκB target DNA binding

being observed (Figure 1A and data not shown). However,
silencing of both GSK-3 isoforms together modestly but
significantly increased basal NFκB transcriptional activity
(Figure 2A). In addition, NFκB transcriptional activity was
increased by treatment of cells with the specific GSK-3
inhibitor CHIR99021 [30] (see Figure 2F). In summary,
chronic silencing of GSK-3β and acute inhibition of
GSK-3α/β led to activation of NFκB, as detected by
increased DNA target binding and transcriptional activity.
We therefore decided to explore the effects of GSK-3
inhibition on NFκB signaling in more detail.
Since silencing of both GSK-3 isoforms together
also activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling in 22Rv1 cells [1],
we wished to determine if stabilization of β-catenin was
responsible for the observed activation of NFκB. Cells were
transfected with a plasmid encoding stabilized β-catenin,
which increased β-catenin/Tcf-dependent transcription
as expected (Figure 2B). β-catenin inhibited NFκBdependent transcription (Figure 2C), suggesting that the
effect of GSK-3 inhibition on NFκB is not mediated by
β-catenin. In addition to increasing basal NFκB activity,
GSK-3 inhibitors reduce AR-dependent transcription [4].
Given previous reports that androgens inhibit NFκB [31,
32], we hypothesized that GSK-3 inhibition leads to NFκB
activation by inhibiting AR. To test this possibility, we first
examined the effect of AR activation on NFκB activation
by Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF). Cells were stimulated
with TNF in the presence or absence of the AR ligand DHT.
DHT treatment reduced TNF activation of NFκB in 22Rv1
cells (Figure 2D) and, to a lesser extent, in LNCaP cells
(data not shown), but not in PC3 cells, which do not express
AR (Figure 2D). These results suggest that AR could play a
role in the activation of NFκB upon GSK-3 inhibition. To
determine the impact of AR on GSK-3 inhibitor-mediated
activation of NFκB, gene reporter assays were carried
out in the presence of the AR antagonist MDV3100. As
expected, MDV3100 inhibited AR transcriptional activity
(Figure 2E). However, it did not affect NFκB activation
by CHIR99021 (Figure 2F), suggesting that the effects of
GSK-3 on NFκB are not mediated via AR.

inhibitor BIO-Acetoxime (BIO) increased p65-Gal4
activity (Figure 3A), suggesting that GSK-3 inhibition
activates NFκB signaling independently of IκB.
To determine if the effects of GSK-3 inhibition
involved changes in NFκB family proteins, we next
examined their expression levels by western blotting.
Silencing of both GSK-3 isoforms together did not
significantly affect most NFκB family members, although
there was a trend for a reduction in the p100/p52 ratio.
However, silencing GSK-3 did result in a small but
significant increase in RelB (Figure 3B). In support of the
gene silencing results, CHIR99021 also increased RelB
levels (Figure 3C). Since GSK-3 regulates the subcellular
localization of many proteins, we examined the effects of
GSK-3 silencing on the localization of p100/52 and p65
(RelB could not be readily detected using the available
antibodies). P100/52 was found mostly in the nucleus
(Figure 3D) and p65 mostly in the cytoplasm (Figure 3E),
and neither one was affected by GSK-3 silencing. Changes in
p65 were also not detected in cells treated with CHIR99021
(Figure 3F). In contrast, treatment of 22Rv1 cells with TNF
induced nuclear translocation of p65 (Figure 3G). Together,
these results raise the possibility that activation of NFκB
upon inhibition of GSK-3 results from an increase in RelB.
To investigate the role of RelB, gene reporter assays were
carried out in 22Rv1 cells silenced for p65, RelB and c-Rel
[35] (Figure 3H). Silencing RelB and, to a lesser extent p65,
but not c-Rel, reduced CHIR99021-mediated activation of
NFκB (Figure 3I), indicating that RelB plays a predominant
role in the response to CHIR99021.

Inhibition of NFκB potentiates the inhibitory
effect of CHIR99021 on PCa cell proliferation
Since activation of NFκB promotes cancer cell
survival, we hypothesized that combined inhibition of
GSK-3 and NFκB would inhibit proliferation in PCa
cells. To test this possibility, we treated 22Rv1 cells with
CHIR99021 to inhibit GSK-3 and PS1145 to inhibit NFκB
signaling. As expected, given the low basal NFκB activity
in 22Rv1 cells, PS1145 alone had no significant effect on
cell number (Figure 4A). However, PS1145 potentiated
the effects of CHIR99021, consistent with our hypothesis.
The activities of the inhibitors were confirmed using gene
reporter assays: CHIR99021 increased β-catenin activity
(Figure 4B) and PS1145 inhibited TNF-induced NFκB
activation (Figure 4C). Since GSK-3 inhibition represses
AR signaling, we also tested the effects of combined
inhibition of GSK-3, NFκB and AR on cell proliferation
using MDV3100. In these experiments we used a dose of
CHIR99021 that had no significant effect on proliferation
when used alone (Figure 4D). As expected, MDV3100
reduced 22Rv1 cell proliferation and this effect was
slightly enhanced by CHIR99021. Importantly, combined
treatment of cells with MDV3100, CHIR99021 and
PS1145 further reduced cell number (Figure 4D). We also

Inhibition of GSK-3 activates NFκB via RelB
NFκB consists of a family of transcription factors
whose subunits p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, and p50 and
p52, generated from the precursors p105 and p100,
respectively, form dimers that regulate gene expression.
IκB proteins sequester NFκB dimers in the cytoplasm and
activation of IκB kinase (IKK) results in IκB degradation
and the release of NFκB [33]. To determine if NFκB
activation upon GSK-3 inhibition involves IκB, we used
the Gal4-p65/Gal4-luc system [34], in which a fusion
protein formed by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and
the p65 transactivation domain drives expression of Gal4responsive luciferase independently of IκB. Treatment

GSK-3 inhibition on cell proliferation. These observations
suggest that combined inhibition of GSK-3 and NFκB
may be required for effective inhibition of prostate tumor
growth.
In this report we have focused on NFkB and its
relationship with AR. However, our analysis of GSK-3
targets revealed additional potential targets and, in
addition, differences between stably silenced and
transiently silenced cells that will require further analysis.
We noted in our earlier study [1] that while there were no
significant differences in growth rates of the stable cell
lines in short-term (72 h) proliferation assays, cell lines
with reduced levels of either GSK-3α or GSK-3β formed
fewer colonies than control cells in colony formation
assays. Moreover, when colony formation assays were
conducted in hormone-depleted medium, GSK-3αsilenced cell lines formed similar numbers of colonies
as control cells, whereas GSK-3β-silenced cells formed
fewer colonies. Those results suggested that chronic
silencing of GSK-3α has an impact on hormone-dependent
growth, while chronic silencing of GSK-3β affects both
hormone-dependent and hormone-independent growth
[1]. However, the mechanisms that underlie the different
transcriptional consequences of short-term versus longterm GSK-3 inhibition are not known. One possibility
is that stable inhibition of GSK-3 isoforms leads to
selection for different cell subsets or types, or changes
the proportions of precursor cells in the population.
Consistent with this possibility, small molecule inhibition
of GSK-3 was recently reported to deplete the population
of prostate cancer stem/progenitor-like cells in PC3 and
PC3M cells, as measured by the proportion of ALDHHIGH
cells and reduced expression of stem/progenitor markers
including NANOG and OCT4 [28]. However, this was not
observed in LNCaP C4-2 and DU145 cells. Our analysis
of 22Rv1 stem/progenitor cell marker gene expression
revealed a small increase in NANOG and reduction in
SOX2 in GSK-3α-silenced cells (Figure 1E), inconsistent
with selection for prostate cancer stem/progenitor-like
cells. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that treatment
of PC3M cells with a small molecule inhibitor of GSK-3
also had opposite effects on expression of NANOG and
SOX2. Further studies will be required to determine if
changes such as these reflect a change in the proportion of
a specific population of progenitor cells.
As outlined in the Introduction, GSK-3 has
previously been linked to NFκB activation and the
mechanisms involved may be highly context-dependent.
Our studies found that acute gene silencing and chemical
inhibition of GSK-3 increase basal NFκB activity.
Inhibition of GSK-3 in serum-starved cells has previously
been reported to activate NFκB via degradation of IκB
and nuclear translocation of p65 [19, 43]. This does
not appear to be the mechanism in PCa cells, since p65
remained in the cytoplasm in CHIR99021-treated cells
(Figure 3F) and inhibition of GSK-3 increased p65-Gal4

(GSEA) [36] of human tumors from a previously
published database [37]. Tumors were first sorted based
on the summed Z-score of the expression levels of a set
of genes that is regulated by androgen signaling (AR
signature) [38]. Tumors with the highest summed Z-scores
were classified as “high AR signature” tumors and those
with the lowest values were classified “low AR signature”
tumors (Figure 5A). GSEA was then used to examine
NFκB pathway activity within these two groups using an
NFκB target gene signature [39]. The NFκB target gene
signature was significantly diminished in tumors with
the high AR signature, supporting the hypothesis that
AR signaling inversely correlates with NFκB signaling
(Figure 5B). This was also observed in an independent
tumor dataset [40] (Figure 5C). We next examined NFκB
target gene expression levels in tumors with high or low
expression of GSK3A and GSK3B. Tumors with a positive
Z-score (compared to normal prostates) of both GSK-3
isoform mRNAs were classified as “high GSK-3”, and
tumors with a negative score for both isoforms were
classified as “low GSK-3”. Although this classification
only reflects GSK-3 mRNA expression (above or below
that in normal prostate) and not kinase activity, it revealed
that tumors with low GSK-3 expression were enriched for
androgen-repressed NFκB target genes (Figures 5D, E).
Finally, in order to determine whether expression of the
androgen-repressed NFκB target genes identified has
prognostic potential in prostate cancer, we analyzed a
publicly available patient data set with follow-up data from
the cBio Cancer Genomics portal [41]. This revealed that
high expression of androgen-repressed NFκB target genes
is significantly correlated with reduced survival in patients
with metastatic prostate cancer (Figure 6). Together, these
findings highlight an inverse correlation between GSK-3/
AR and NFκB signaling in patient tumors with potential
clinical importance in metastatic prostate cancer.

DISCUSSION
The involvement of GSK-3 in cancer is complex,
with evidence supporting roles for this kinase as a tumor
suppressor and a tumor promoter. Further complexity
arises from the existence of multiple GSK-3 isoforms
with differences in expression, subcellular localization
and substrate preference. GSK-3 inhibitors are currently
in clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic
cancer [42], and have the potential to be used to treat
several other types of cancer, including PCa. Given the
complex responses to GSK-3 in different cell types,
it will be important to identify tumor-specific GSK-3
targets as biomarkers for effective treatment. In addition,
it is essential to identify targets that may have undesired
effects on tumor cell survival or proliferation. The present
study reveals that inhibition of GSK-3 in PCa cells leads
to activation of NFκB, and that this reduces the impact of

activity (Figure 3A), which suggests activation takes
place downstream of IKK/IκB. Instead, we observed
increased levels of RelB upon GSK-3 inhibition, as has
been reported in Jurkat cells, where GSK-3 was found
to promote RelB degradation [44]. The importance of
RelB in PCa is underlined by its increased expression in
high Gleason score tumors [45], and by a study in which
gene silencing of RelB reduced PCa cell tumorigenicity
[46]. Although we did not detect changes in p65 levels
or nuclear localization upon GSK-3 inhibition, the results
of the p65-Gal4 reporter assays (Figure 3A) and the gene
silencing experiments (Figure 3I) suggest that p65 may
play an indirect role in GSK-3 inhibitor-induced NFκB
activation. Such a role could result from the known crossregulation of p65 and RelB signaling, which takes place at
several levels [33].
Analysis of AR and NFκB transcriptional activities
in PCa cell lines suggests an inverse association that also
correlates with GSK-3. One possibility is that a reduction in
GSK-3 signaling activity, for example resulting from loss
of PTEN, leads to activation of NFκB, which then inhibits

AR signaling. This would be inconsistent with the view that
NFκB increases AR expression and/or activity [47–49],
although there is also evidence that NFκB inhibits AR in
androgen-dependent PCa [50]. A second possibility is that
inhibition of GSK-3 reduces AR activity, which then leads
to NFκB activation. This would be consistent with our
observation and other reports that activation of AR inhibits
NFκB [31, 32]. However, the AR antagonist MDV3100
did not increase basal NFκB activity or potentiate GSK-3
inhibitor-mediated NFκB activation (Figure 2F), suggesting
that this not the case in 22Rv1 cells. A third possibility is
that GSK-3 independently regulates AR and NFκB and
their relative activities are determined by the activation
state of GSK-3. This possibility would be consistent
with the gene expression data, which showed an inverse
correlation between androgen- and NFκB-dependent
target gene expression in PCa that correlates with GSK-3
mRNA expression. In addition, we observed a correlation
of ‘androgen-repressed NFκB target’ gene expression and
reduced survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer
(Figure 6). While this manuscript was in review, a study

was published of the effects of increased NFκB activity and
androgen-depletion on gene expression in non-tumorigenic
mouse prostates. This led to the identification of a gene
expression signature that predicted disease-specific survival
and distant metastases-free survival in patients with PCa
[51]. Intriguingly, the genes in that signature do not show
any overlap with the genes we analyzed here. Further
studies will be required to establish if these tumor signatures
arise from specific misregulation of NFκB- and androgendependent signaling in a subset of tumor cells, or from
tumors of different cellular compositions.
Our results suggest that combining GSK-3, AR and
NFκB inhibitors will provide a more effective therapy than
single agents for the treatment of some prostate tumors.
A  combination of GSK-3 and NFκB inhibitors was
recently proposed for treatment of osteosarcoma [52].
In this example, however, inhibition of GSK-3 reduced
NFκB activity, once again underlining the contextdependent nature of the link between GSK-3 and NFκB
signaling. Importantly, since silencing GSK-3α alone
reduces AR activity without activating NFκB, our results
support the case for the development and sequential use
of isoform-specific GSK-3 inhibitors [53] to treat different
stages of PCa.

experiments using Student’s t test.

Plasmids and transfections
Plasmids for β-catenin (pmT23 β-catenin) [58],
pSM2c GSK-3α (αsh1 and αsh2), GSK-3β (βsh1 and
βsh2) and control shRNA plasmid (Open Biosystems,
Madrid, Spain) [59, 60], RelA, RelB and c-Rel shRNAs
[35] (from B. Lewis (NCI, Bethesda, MA, USA)
and pSUPER-Retro-puro control shRNA [61] (from
A. Carracedo, CIC bioGUNE) were previously described.
Gene reporter assays were carried out using NFκBluciferase (Clontech), pGal4, pGal4-p65 [62] and Gal4luciferase (from the BCCM/LMBP, Ghent University/
Lienhard Schmitz, Institute of Biochemistry, University
of Giessen), pRL-TK (Promega), MMTV-luciferase (from
C. Bevan, Imperial College London) and Super8xTOP/
FOPFlash [63] (from R. Moon, University of Washington,
Seattle). Cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2
(22Rv1) or 25,000 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates and 24–48
hours later transfected using 1 μl of Lipofectamine, 2 μl
of Plus reagent, 100 ng of firefly luciferase reporter, 0.5 ng
pGal4/pGal4-p65 (where indicated), 15 ng of pRL-TK
and up to 200 ng (unless otherwise indicated) of shRNA
or expression plasmids, according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was measured
with the DualGlo Stop&Glo luciferase assay system
(Promega). For experiments using MMTV-luciferase, cells
were cultured in phenol red-free RPMI and 10% charcoalstripped serum.

METHODS
Cell culture and proliferation assays
22Rv1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640/
DMEM (1:1) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20%
FCS and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml
streptomycin) at 37ºC and 5% CO2. LNCaP and PC3
cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FCS and antibiotics. Cells were passaged when
they reached 70–80% confluence at 1:5–6 using 0.05%
trypsin. For proliferation assays, cells were seeded at a
density of 1,000 cells/cm2 in triplicate in 12-well plates
and inhibitors or an equal volume of carrier were added
the next day. Media were replaced and fresh inhibitors
added every other day for 7 days. Cells were then rinsed
with PBS, stained with crystal violet, rinsed again, airdried and images acquired. In some experiments, crystal
violet was subsequently solubilized in 10% acetic acid and
absorbance measured at 590 nm. The GSK-3 inhibitors
CHIR99021 (Axon Medchem and Calbiochem) and BIOacetoxime (Merck), the IKK inhibitor PS1145 (Sigma)
and the AR inhibitor MDV3100 (Selleck Chemicals LLC)
were all dissolved in DMSO. TNF (R&D) was dissolved
in PBS + 0.1% BSA and DHT (Sigma) in ethanol.

Transcription factor binding screen
Cells were rinsed in PBS and nuclear extracts were
prepared using the Nuclear Extraction Kit (Panomics).
5 μg of nuclear extract was used for hybridization with the
TranSignal™ Protein/DNA Array I (Panomics), according
to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, nuclear extracts

were incubated with a pool of biotin-labeled transcription
factor (TF) binding probes, and DNA/TF complexes
were isolated using an ion-exchange column. Finally,
the isolated DNA probes were hybridized to membranes
containing complementary TF binding site sequences and
bound probes were visualized using an HRP-conjugated
anti-biotin antibody. Quantitation was done by selecting
non-saturated exposures of high-resolution scans of the
membranes, grid circles and calculating the average signal
using ImageJ software, using negative controls as a blank
and taking the average signal from the row of positive
controls for each membrane to normalize the data for each
membrane. Binding assay experiments were carried out at
least twice each, and, in the case of the stable lines, using
two different shRNAs for each GSK-3 isoform.

Analysis of microarray data

datasets used (Becic [37]; Taylor [40]) are available

action) and cBio Cancer Genomics (www.cbioportal.
org/public-portal/), respectively. Cell files containing
raw data were normalized with RMAExpress (Robust
Multichip Average) software, and chips with normalized
unscaled standard error (NUSE) or relative log expression
(RLE) values 1.5 IQR (interquartile range) above the
upper quartile or 1.5 IQR below the lower quartile
were discarded in further analysis. The intensity of the
androgen-responsive-gene signature [38] was then scored
using the Z-score values calculated for the genes included
in the signature, and those tumors with highest or lowest
added Z-score were classified as high or low AR-signature,
respectively. Similarly, the Z-score was calculated for
GSK3A and GSK3B and tumors with a Z-score value
of GSK3A and GSK3B > 0.5 were classified high total
GSK3, and tumors with a Z-value < ˗0.5 for both isoforms
were classified as low total GSK3. Gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) [36] was performed with the normalized
gene expression values from the tumors classified as above
(high vs. low AR signature; high vs. low GSK3), and
the level of enrichment of the NFκB signature [39] was
calculated using Student’s t test on the collapsed probe sets
and running 1000 permutations. Kaplan Meier plots were
obtained from cBio Cancer Genomics portal analyzing
the Michigan metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma dataset
[41]. Statistical significance of the whole sample was
determined with the log rank test both at 100 months and
220 months, with the former found to be significant.

Western blotting
Cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed in RIPA
(radioimmunoprecipitation assay) lysis buffer (19)
containing Complete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)
and PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)
on ice for 15 minutes, cleared by centrifugation and used
directly or frozen on dry ice for later use. 20 μg of lysate
was resolved on 8% or 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels,
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman).
Nonspecific binding was blocked using 3% BSA/TBST
(TBS with 0.05% Tween-20), and blots were probed
overnight at 4ºC with primary antibodies. Blots were washed
in TBST and antigens were detected using HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies as previously described [1, 59].
Primary antibodies, diluted 1:1000, were to GSK-3α (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology sc-5264), GSK-3β (BD Biosciences
610202), HSP60 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GAPDH
(Sigma), and to NFkB p65 (D14E12), RelB (C1E4), c-Rel,
p105/p50 and p100/p52 (18D10) (all Cell Signaling).
