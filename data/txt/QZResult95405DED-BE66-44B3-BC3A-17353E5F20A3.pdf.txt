BACKGROUND: The randomized, controlled BOLERO-2 (Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus) trial demonstrated significantly
improved progression-free survival with the use of everolimus plus exemestane (EVE þ EXE) versus placebo plus exemestane
(PBO þ EXE) in patients with advanced breast cancer who developed disease progression after treatment with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. This analysis investigated the treatment effects on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: Using the
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire, HRQOL was assessed at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter until disease progression and/or treatment discontinuation. The
30 items in 15 subscales of the QLQ-C30 include global health status wherein higher scores (range, 0-100) indicate better HRQOL.
This analysis included a protocol-specified time to definitive deterioration (TDD) analysis at a 5% decrease in HRQOL versus baseline,
with no subsequent increase above this threshold. The authors report additional sensitivity analyses using 10-point minimal important
difference decreases in the global health status score versus baseline. Treatment arms were compared using the stratified log-rank
test and Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for trial stratum (visceral metastases, previous hormone sensitivity), age, sex, race,
baseline global health status score and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, prognostic risk factors, and treatment history. RESULTS: Baseline global health status scores were found to be similar between treatment groups (64.7 vs 65.3). The
median TDD in HRQOL was 8.3 months with EVE þ EXE versus 5.8 months with PBO þ EXE (hazard ratio, 0.74; P ¼.0084). At the 10point minimal important difference, the median TDD with EVE þ EXE was 11.7 months versus 8.4 months with PBO þ EXE (hazard ratio,
0.80; P ¼.1017). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced breast cancer who develop disease progression after treatment with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors, EVE þ EXE was associated with a longer TDD in global HRQOL versus PBO þ EXE. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Everolimus (EVE) is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor with direct anticancer effects. In preclinical and clinical
studies, EVE demonstrated that mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition can enhance the efficacy of endocrine therapy,
including exemestane (EXE).1-3 The phase 3 BOLERO-2 (Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus) trial was designed to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of EVE þ EXE versus placebo (PBO) þ EXE in postmenopausal women with hormone

receptor-positive advanced breast cancer who developed
disease progression after treatment with nonsteroidal
aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs; letrozole or anastrozole).4
Data from an interim analysis at 7 months of follow-up
demonstrated that EVE þ EXE significantly improved
the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS)
versus PBO þ EXE (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; P < .001)
based on local investigator assessment.4 Median durations
of PFS were 6.9 months and 2.8 months, respectively.
The PFS benefit was confirmed at 12.5 months and 18
months of median follow-up.5,6 Adverse events were consistent with the safety profile of EVE.6 The findings from
this trial supported the recent approval in the United
States and Europe of EVE þ EXE for the treatment of
postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive
advanced breast cancer who developed disease progression
while receiving treatment with NSAIs.7,8
Treatment-related toxicities combined with often
painful and debilitating metastases resulting from disease
progression can erode health-related quality of life
(HRQOL).9-12 Therefore, in addition to clinical benefit,
providing palliation and maximizing HRQOL remain the
key goals of treating patients with advanced breast cancer.13 Studies of HRQOL can aid in treatment selection
and provide information regarding the impact of disease
progression on patients’ lives.14,15 Furthermore, evaluation of HRQOL concerns such as fatigue, pain, and anxiety, as well as the impact of disease on physical and social
functioning, can augment the overall risk:benefit analysis,
and HRQOL is now regarded as an important outcome
in clinical cancer trials.14,16,17 These outcomes are especially important in patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, in whom endocrine therapy
options after disease progression with NSAI treatment
(eg, fulvestrant and EXE) might provide limited therapeutic benefit, but have relatively low toxicity.18 In the BOLERO-2 trial, time to HRQOL deterioration was a
secondary objective because it was essential to determine
the impact of EVE þ EXE versus PBO þ EXE on
HRQOL. In the current study, we report the results of
that HRQOL analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Study Design

The study design for BOLERO-2 has been described
previously.4 The population comprised postmenopausal
women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)–negative, metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer who developed

disease progression despite prior treatment with anastrozole or letrozole. All patients provided informed consent.
In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial, all patients received EXE (at a
dose of 25 mg/day) and were randomized 2:1 to treatment
with EVE (at a dose of 10 mg/day) or matching PBO.4
Randomization was stratified by the presence of visceral
metastasis (yes vs no) and sensitivity to prior hormonal
therapy (yes vs no).4 Treatment continued until disease
progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity, or
withdrawal of patient consent.
The primary endpoint was PFS, as assessed by investigators. Overall survival, overall response rate, clinical
benefit rate, time to deterioration of Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, safety,
and HRQOL were secondary endpoints. This analysis
includes HRQOL outcomes; the results of all other endpoints have been reported previously.5,6
HRQOL Assessment

HRQOL was evaluated at baseline and every 6 weeks
thereafter until disease progression and/or discontinuation using version 3.0 of the European Organisation for
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). All questionnaires were completed at the study center before disease
assessment. The questionnaire consists of 30 items
arranged in 15 subscales, including a global health status/
QOL scale; higher scores for this scale (range, 0-100) indicate better HRQOL.19
Statistical Analysis

All HRQOL analyses were performed on the full analysis
set (N ¼ 724). Partially completed questionnaires were
included if the data were sufficient to calculate the global
health status/QOL domain subscale score. A deterioration
event was defined as a 5% decrease in HRQOL relative to
baseline. Protocol-specified time to definitive deterioration (TDD) in the global health status score was defined
as a 5% HRQOL decrease relative to baseline, with no
subsequent increase above this threshold. The ‘‘5%
decrease in HRQOL from baseline’’ criterion was selected
based on previously established thresholds for minimal
important differences (MID) in QOL from the perspective of the patient.20 This criterion for TDD was less stringent than previously published MID values for global
health status.21-23 Generally established and accepted
MID values for global health status range from 5 to 10
points. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to
assess the larger, 10-point MID decrease in global health
status score compared with baseline; this criterion has been

validated for EORTC QLQ-C30 in other studies.
TDD in global health status for each of the definitions was
calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and was described
using medians and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
TDD was compared between the treatment groups using a
stratified log-rank test (strata were based on the presence of
visceral metastases and sensitivity to hormonal therapy)
with a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05, and a multivariate
Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for trial strata
(the presence of visceral metastases and sensitivity to hormone therapy), age, sex, race, baseline score and ECOG
performance status, prognostic risk factors, and treatment
history. If a definitive deterioration event was observed after
missing assessments, the event was backdated to the first of
the missing assessments before the deterioration (ie, calculated as the last available assessment before the definitive
deterioration plus 8 weeks). No other adjustments were
made for missing data. Patients who had no definitive deterioration events were censored at the time of the last available assessment. All analyses were conducted using SAS
statistical software for Windows (version 9.2; SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC).

The median duration of treatment exposure was 23.9
weeks for EVE and 29.5 weeks for EXE in the
EVE þ EXE arm and 13.4 weeks for PBO and 14.1 weeks
for EXE in the PBO þ EXE arm. Most patients in the
EVE þ EXE and PBO þ EXE treatment arms discontinued treatment because of disease progression (62% vs
89%, respectively). Other reasons for discontinuation
included adverse events (10% vs 3%, respectively) and
consent withdrawal (9% vs 3%, respectively).
Efficacy and Safety

Data from a preplanned analysis at a median follow-up
of 18 months demonstrated that EVE þ EXE more
than doubled PFS versus PBO þ EXE.6 However,
EVE þ EXE was associated with a higher incidence of
adverse events than PBO þ EXE, with the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events (graded using the NCI
CTCAE version 3.0) being stomatitis, hyperglycemia,
and fatigue.6
Questionnaire Completion Rates

At baseline, questionnaires were completed by 455
patients (93.8%) in the EVE þ EXE arm and 224 patients
(93.7%) in the PBO þ EXE arm. Data are presented
through 48 weeks only, given a substantial decrease in
subsequent data availability in both treatment arms.
Questionnaire compliance was > 80% through week 48
and was not found to be markedly different between the
treatment arms (Fig. 1a). Questionnaire completion rates
decreased from baseline to week 48 (Fig. 1b), mainly
because of disease progression and subsequent removal
from the study. Compared with baseline, completion rates
from weeks 12 through 48 were higher in the EVE þ EXE
arm versus the PBO þ EXE arm (Fig. 1b).
TDD in Global Health Status

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Disposition

Between June 2009 and January 2011, 724 women across
189 centers in 24 countries were randomized to study
treatments (485 in the EVE þ EXE arm and 239 in the
PBO þ EXE arm).4 The treatment arms were well balanced for patient and disease characteristics, including
ECOG performance status score.4 Notably, the majority
of patients in both the EVE þ EXE and PBO þ EXE
treatment arms had an ECOG performance status score
of 0 (60% vs 59%, respectively) (Table 1).
At a median follow-up of 18 months, 91 patients
continued to receive study treatment: 81 (17%) in the
EVE þ EXE arm and 10 (4%) in the PBO þ EXE arm.6
1910

Baseline global health status scores were similar between
the EVE þ EXE and PBO þ EXE arms (64.7 vs 65.3,
respectively; difference, 0.7 [95% CI, 4.3 to 3.0]).
At a median follow-up of 18 months, the cumulative percentages of patients with a definitive deterioration in global health status treated with EVE þ EXE
versus PBO þ EXE were comparable for both TDD definitions (Table 2). At a 5% change from baseline, 49%
of patients in the EVE þ EXE arm versus 44% of
patients in the PBO þ EXE arm had a definitive deterioration event, and death occurred in 3% of patients in
each treatment arm. At a 10-point MID, definitive deterioration rates were 39% in the EVE þ EXE arm versus
30% in the PBO þ EXE arm, and death rates were 3%
and 5%, respectively.

DISCUSSION
The current study assessed the effects of treatment with
EVE þ EXE versus PBO þ EXE on patients’ HRQOL
using the EORTC QLQ-C30, which is one of the most
common and well-developed/validated instruments for
measuring HRQOL in oncology trials.15,24 The EORTC
QLQ-C30 global health status scores were analyzed based
on 2 definitions of TDD: a protocol-specified 5% change
from baseline and a MID of a 10-point change from baseline that was found to be relevant in other cancer populations.21 With the 5% change from baseline, the TDD of
global health status was found to be prolonged in patients
who received EVE þ EXE versus those receiving
PBO þ EXE (8.3 months vs 5.8 months, respectively;
P ¼ .0084). Using the 10-point MID assessment, the difference in TDD between the EVE þ EXE and
PBO þ EXE arms (11.7 months vs 8.4 months, respectively; P ¼ .1017) was of a magnitude similar to that
observed with the 5% TDD analysis, with more profound
benefits noted in patients with a baseline ECOG performance status of 1 or 2 and those aged < 65 years. Unadjusted cumulative definitive deterioration event rates were
slightly higher in the EVE þ EXE treatment arm versus
the PBO þ EXE arm, although the TDD of global health
status was longer with EVE þ EXE. This is likely because
of the earlier occurrence of disease progression in patients
treated with PBO þ EXE compared with those receiving
EVE þ EXE, and the resultant longer follow-up of
patients in the EVE þ EXE arm. Together, these results
indicate that, at a minimum, adding EVE to EXE does
Cancer

not have a deleterious effect on HRQOL versus the use of
PBO þ EXE in patients with hormone receptor-positive
advanced breast cancer who develop disease progression
after initial treatment with NSAIs.
The improvement in the TDD of global health
status with EVE þ EXE was demonstrated despite a
higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicities and discontinuations because of adverse events reported in this treatment
arm.6 Therefore, it is possible that other factors, such as
clinical benefit, may have contributed to this longer TDD
noted in global health status in the EVE þ EXE arm. In
the BOLERO-2 trial, at a median follow-up of 18
months, EVE þ EXE more than doubled the median
PFS6 and resulted in higher clinical benefit rates compared with PBO þ EXE.5 Furthermore, lower overall
mortality rates were reported in the EVE þ EXE treatment arm versus the PBO þ EXE arm; this difference
was not statistically significant and mature survival
data were still awaited at the time of last follow-up.6
In addition, at a median follow-up of 18 months, the
EVE þ EXE treatment arm was associated with much
lower discontinuation rates because of disease progression (62% vs 89%), and a greater percentage of
patients in this arm were still receiving treatment at
the time of last follow-up (17% vs 4%).6 Protocoldefined adverse event management strategies may also
have helped limit HRQOL deterioration.25 In contrast
to these findings, although second-line endocrine
therapies such as EXE and fulvestrant have not been
associated with worsening HRQOL, to the best of
our knowledge they have provided only limited clinical efficacy in the advanced breast cancer setting after
NSAI therapy. These observations suggest that significantly improved clinical efficacy outcomes may have
positively impacted HRQOL in the EVEþEXE arm
despite higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicities
observed with EVEþEXE.

As with most HRQOL studies, a limitation of the
current study is the number of missing questionnaires.
Although compliance with questionnaire completion was
high (> 80%) in both treatment arms, data availability
decreased over time because of study discontinuations
subsequent to progressive disease (because HRQOL was
not assessed after disease progression). Patients who did
not meet definitive deterioration criteria before disease
progression were censored. Given that a greater percentage of patients developed disease progression earlier in the
PBO þ EXE arm compared with the EVE þ EXE arm,
and that HRQOL typically deteriorates after disease progression,26 this analysis is likely conservative in terms of
the benefit of EVE þ EXE.
Although effective treatments for breast cancer are
expected to maintain or improve the patient’s HRQOL, as
has been demonstrated with EVE þ EXE in the current
study, mixed effects on HRQOL have been observed in the
setting of advanced breast cancer.27 Some studies investigating combined targeted therapies (eg, lapatinib plus trastuzumab vs lapatinib alone) reported small, nonsignificant
HRQOL benefits,28 but these effects are inconsistent. In
other studies, adverse events attributable to breast cancer
treatment (such as the TEX [epirubicin, paclitaxel, and
capecitabine] regimen) had a detrimental impact on
HRQOL.29 Symptom clusters such as pain, fatigue, insomnia, and mood disturbances are prevalent in patients after
cancer treatment, particularly chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and can adversely affect QOL and functional status.30
In addition, decreases in QOL may also be exacerbated by
the route of administration of chemotherapy,31 as well as
the dose intensity of the regimen.32 Time-to-progression or
PFS benefits observed with the addition of targeted agents
to chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy (eg, capecitabine
or letrozole plus lapatinib vs either treatment alone) generally have neutral effects at best on QOL,14,33 most likely
because the delay in disease progression is offset by an
increased burden of adverse events. Given that HRQOL
might also be prognostic in women with metastatic breast
cancer,34,35 it is essential to take into account the potential
negative effects of treatment on HRQOL, and the HRQOL
data from BOLERO-2 are reassuring in this context.
In the BOLERO-2 trial, postmenopausal women
with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer
who developed disease progression after initial treatment
with NSAI and then received the all-oral combination of
EVE þ EXE experienced a longer TDD in their global
HRQOL than those in the PBO þ EXE treatment arm.
This was particularly evident in younger patients and
those with a reduced ECOG performance status at base1914

line. Together with significant improvements in clinical
efficacy outcomes, these HRQOL findings provide added
support for the benefit of EVE þ EXE in this patient
population.
