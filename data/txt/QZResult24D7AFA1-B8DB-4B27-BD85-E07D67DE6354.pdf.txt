Abstract
Cell cycle checkpoint abrogation, especially the inhibition of
Chk1 in combination with DNA-damaging treatments, has
been proposed as a promising way of sensitizing cancer cells.
However, less is known about the possibility to selectively
affect tumor cells when they are treated with agents that block
DNA synthesis in combination with replication checkpoint
inhibitors. Here, we present clear insights in the different
responses of tumor and non-transformed cells to the
inhibition of DNA replication with hydroxyurea in combination with checkpoint abrogation via inhibition of Ataxia
telangiectasia–mutated– (ATM) and Rad3-related/ATM (ATR/
ATM) and Chk1 kinases. Interestingly, we find that nontransformed cell lines activate ATR/ATM- and Chk1-independent pathways in response to replication inhibition to prevent
mitotic entry with unreplicated DNA. In contrast, tumor cell
lines such as HCT116 and HeLa cells rely entirely on Chk1
activity for a proper response to replication inhibitors. Our
results show that p38 is activated in response to hydroxyurea
treatment and collaborates with Chk1 to prevent mitotic entry
in non-transformed cell lines by maintaining cyclin B1/Cdk1
complexes inactive. Furthermore, DNA replication arrest
down-regulates cyclin B1 promoter activity in non-transformed cells, but not in tumor cells in a Chk1- and p38independent way. Thus, our data show that non-transformed
cells present a more robust DNA replication checkpoint
response compared with tumor cells that involves activation
of the p38 pathway. We show that some of these responses to
replication block can be lost in tumor cells, causing a defective
checkpoint and providing a rationale for tumor-selective
effects of combined therapies. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):11648–56]

Introduction
The maintenance of genomic integrity is essential for the health
of multicellular organisms. Consequently, cell cycle checkpoints
have evolved to monitor genomic stability and coordinate repair
and cell cycle progression (1). Some of those checkpoints are
control pathways that delay or prevent cells from entering mitosis
under conditions that can compromise genome integrity—for
instance, in the presence of damaged or unreplicated DNA. Defects
in these processes cause genomic instability and predispose to

cancer (2–4). Key proteins involved in monitoring DNA damage are
Ataxia telangiectasia–mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related
(ATR), two serine/threonine kinase members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase–like family and inhibited by caffeine (5). Activation of
these kinases results in the phosphorylation of a diverse array of
downstream targets that participate in numerous cellular events,
including DNA damage recognition and processing, cell cycle
arrest, and apoptosis. Chk1 and Chk2 are key mediator kinases
involved in the cell cycle arrest response (2). Regarding the G2-M
checkpoint response, these kinases phosphorylate and inactivate
Cdc25 phosphatase family (6). Because Cdc25 phosphatase family
activates cyclin B1/Cdk1, which is essential for mitotic entry, the
cell cycle is finally arrested at the G2-M transition. Apart from this
fast response, G2 DNA damage also induces changes in gene
expression that finally maintain mitotic entry arrest, such as p53induced Gadd45, p21, and 14-3-3j expression or p53-dependent
and p53-independent down-regulation of cyclin B1 or Plk1 (7–9).
The family of p38 stress-activated protein kinase (p38) also
inhibits mitotic entry in response to diverse events such as osmotic
and oxidative stress, UV light, DNA-damaging agents, or microtubule
disassembly (10, 11). Once activated, p38 can phosphorylate a variety
of cellular targets, including mitogen-activated protein kinase–
activated protein kinase-2 (MK2), which, in turn, phosphorylates
Cdc25 phosphatases at the same sites as Chk1 and Chk2 (12, 13).
The relevance of this pathway in the response to DNA damage
varies depending on the cell type, and it has been suggested that it
may be an early response to cellular stress. If DNA damage is finally
achieved by genotoxic stress, the ATR- and ATM-dependent
responses are activated to maintain the inhibition of Cdc25 (14).
To preserve genetic integrity, mammalian cells with stalled
replication forks also activate a checkpoint response to delay the
initiation of late origins (intra-S checkpoint) and mitotic entry
(S/M checkpoint). The exact functioning of this checkpoint is not
well understood, but it shares common elements with the one
activated by DNA damage. ATR, Rad17, Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex
and Claspin bind independently to stalled replication forks. Once
loaded onto DNA, Rad17 and Claspin collaborate in the activation
of ATR that will phosphorylate different substrates as Rad17 itself
and Chk1 (15, 16). Chk1 has a central role in the checkpoint
response because it finally phosphorylates and inhibits Cdc25 and
consequently blocks cyclin B1/Cdk1 activation and mitotic entry
when DNA synthesis is inhibited (6, 17). There is increasing
evidence that this entire process occurs not only in response to
stalled replication forks, but also during the normal S phase,
although at a lower intensity, to inhibit mitotic entry while DNA
synthesis is still under way (18, 19).
The presence of an ATR- and ATM-independent pathway
activated by DNA synthesis inhibition has also been described
(20, 21). We have previously described that this pathway leads to a
p53-independent down-regulation of cyclin B1 expression (20).

Chk1-Independent DNA Replication Checkpoint

Interestingly, this checkpoint response is not functional in most
colorectal cancer–derived cell lines analyzed, but is functional in
non-transformed cell lines, in HeLa cells, and in derived pancreatic
cancer cell lines tested. We have also previously shown that in HeLa
cells, Chk1 is essential for the checkpoint response; consequently,
in these cells, Chk1 can be activated independently of ATR and
ATM (22). Here, we analyze whether in non-transformed cell lines,
the ATR- and ATM-independent response needs the participation
of Chk1 to avoid mitotic entry when DNA replication is blocked
and define the differences with tumor cells. We show that, on the
one hand, p38 collaborates with Chk1 to block cyclin B1/Cdk1
activation, and on the other hand, there is an ATR/ATM-, Chk1-,
and p38-independent pathway that allows the down-regulation of
cyclin B1 expression in non-transformed cell lines. Therefore, our
data show that the DNA replication checkpoint has redundant
responses to inhibit mitotic entry, and that some of these
responses are not functional in tumor cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. HeLa cells, mouse embryo fibroblasts wild-type (MEFs
WT), MEFs p38a / (both gift from Dr. Angel Nebreda, Centro Nacional de
Investigaciones Oncológicas, Madrid, Spain) and Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS). Normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were grown in DMEM
supplemented with 5% FCS. HCT116 and SW480 cells were grown in
DMEM/HAM F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% FCS. NIH3T3 cells in DMEM
supplemented with 10% donor bovine serum (DBS). NRK, NIH3T3, and
HCT116 cells were made quiescent by serum starvation and synchronously
activated to proliferate as indicated in Supplementary Methods S1.
Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Cell extracts were obtained
and electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) or nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) membranes
(according to the manufacturer’s instructions) essentially as previously
described (22, 23) and in Supplementary Data S1.
Flow cytometry. To analyze the DNA content, cells were trypsinized,
washed with PBS, and centrifuged during 5 min at 2,000 rpm. Pelleted cells
were resuspended in 500 AL PBS, fixed with 4.5 mL cold ( 20jC) 70%
ethanol and stored at 4jC. Cells were then washed with PBS, centrifuged,
and incubated with 20 Ag/mL propidium iodide (Sigma) dissolved in PBS
with 0.2 mg/mL RNase A (Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) for
30 min at room temperature. DNA content was measured by flow cytometry
(FACScan Analyser, Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using the Sync Wizard
Model, ModFit LT software (Becton Dickinson). For combined analysis of
DNA content and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, cells were
first incubated for 30 min with 10 Amol/L of BrdUrd analyzed using the
FITC BrdUrd Flow Kit (BD PharMingen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Immunocytochemistry and laser scanning cytometry analysis.
Quantification of the percentage of cells positive for phospho-histone H3
(Ser10) by laser scanning cytometry (LSC) was done exactly as previously
described (22). To detect phospho-H2AX (P-H2AX) foci, immunocytochemistry was done as for phospho-H3, but using primary antibody against
P-H2AX (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; 1:200 dilution).
Lamina B, a-tubulin, and cyclin B1 were analyzed by immunocytochemistry using antibodies against Lamina B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology M-20;
1:50 dilution), a-tubulin FITC or cyclin B1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; 1:20
dilution) as indicated in Supplementary Data S1. BrdUrd immunocytochemistry was done as previously described (24) after incubation of the cells
with BrdUrd (10 Amol/L).
Small interfering RNA. NIH3T3 cells were grown for 1 day on glass
coverslips and transfected with either the mouse specific small interfering
RNA (siRNA) SMARTpools of Chk1 (Dharmacon) or the p38a and p38h
siRNA SMARTpools (MAPK14 and MAPK11, both Dharmacon), using
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

www.aacrjournals.org

For HeLa cells, the procedure was the same, but using human specific
siRNA SMARTpool of Chk1 (Dharmacon; ref. 22). Control experiments were
done transfecting the cells with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) duplex
siRNA (NNGGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCA sequence, Dharmacon).
Cyclin B1 promoter activity regulation. NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with 150 ng of pGL3-CycB1 promoter ( 872 to +22, upstream
of a luciferase reporter gene; gift of Dr. K.-M. Yao, Universiy of Hong Kong)
and 10 ng of pRLSV-Luc. In all experiments, luciferase activity was assayed
48 h after transfection and normalized taking into account the value
obtained with Renilla luciferase. Firefly luciferase (Luc) and Renilla
luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Duplicates or triplicates were systematically included, and experiments
were repeated at least thrice.
Colony formation assay. HCT116 and NRK synchronized cells were
treated in the S phase with 1.5 mmol/L hydroxyurea, 5 mmol/L caffeine
(Sigma), 300 nmol/L UCN-01 (National Cancer Institute), and different
combinations of these inhibitors. After 6 h, cells were trypsinized, counted,
and seeded in 60-mm dishes (1,000 cells per dish). After this, cells were kept
growing in fresh medium without any drug during 10 days. After this time,
colonies were fixed, stained with crystal violet solution, and counted.
Immunoprecipitation and Cdc2 kinase assay. Cells were lysed for
30 min at 4jC in IP buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100,
5 mmol/L EDTA, 250 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L NaF, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Ag/mL aprotinin, and 10 Ag/mL
leupeptin]. Lysates were clarified by centrifuging at 10,000  g for 10 min.
Lysates (500 Ag of protein for NRK cells or 100 Ag for HCT116 cells) were
incubated with 2 Ag of anti-cyclin B1 (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies or
with 2 Ag of mouse immunoglobulin Gs (IgG) as a control overnight at 4jC.
Protein immunocomplexes were pulled down with G-Sepharose (Sigma)
and kinase activity analyzed exactly as described previously (20). Data were
recorded using Personal FX (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with Quantity One
software (Bio-Rad).

Results
ATR/ATM and Chk1 inhibition does not abrogate hydroxyureainduced S/M response in non-transformed cell lines. Most tumorderived cell lines have a checkpoint response to DNA synthesis
inhibition that relies entirely on Chk1 and is consequently
abrogated by UCN01. We have previously shown that nontransformed cell lines such as NRK cells, NIH3T3, or MEFs have
a caffeine-insensitive checkpoint response (20). Because caffeine
inhibits ATR and ATM, kinases that can activate Chk1, here, we
tested whether the checkpoint response to hydroxyurea treatment
described in non-transformed cell lines is dependent on this kinase.
HeLa and HCT116 were used as tumor cell lines, both of epithelial
origin. NRK, NIH3T3, and MDCK, the first two fibroblastic and the
last epithelial, were used as non–tumor cell lines. To activate the
DNA replication checkpoint response, asynchronous cells were
treated with 1.5 mmol/L hydroxyurea for 25 h. The functionality of
the checkpoint was determined analyzing the percentage of
phospho-histone H3 (P-H3)–positive cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, all
non-transformed cell lines analyzed had a functional checkpoint
response because all of them inhibited mitotic entry when treated
with hydroxyurea. In agreement with our previous results, addition
of caffeine during the last 10 h abrogated the checkpoint response
in HCT116 cells, but not in the other cell lines analyzed.
Furthermore, as in previous research, the checkpoint response in
HeLa and HCT116 cells was abrogated by UCN01, a Chk1 inhibitor.
UCN01 also abrogated checkpoint response in SW480 and HT29
colorectal cancer tumor cells (data not shown). In contrast, UCN01
did not abrogate the checkpoint response in either NRK, NIH3T3,
or MDCK cells. Therefore, all non-transformed cell lines analyzed

here, either fibroblastic or epithelial, had a UCN01-insensitive
checkpoint response that was not functional in tumor-derived cell
lines. Moreover, neither the checkpoint was abrogated when using
20 Amol/L SB218078 (Sigma), another unrelated Chk1 inhibitor. To
finally prove Chk1 participation, we knocked down Chk1 expression
using a siRNA pool specific for Chk1. As shown in Fig. 1B, siRNA
inhibited Chk1 expression, but NIH3T3 cells did not enter mitosis
in the presence of hydroxyurea. In contrast, and confirming
our previously reported data (22), hydroxyurea-treated HeLa
cells entered mitosis when transfected with a siRNA pool specific
for Chk1.
To avoid excessive exposure to hydroxyurea, which might have
caused DNA damage, cells were synchronized in G0 and released
into high serum as indicated in Supplementary Methods S1. Once
in the S phase (16 h after serum addition for NRK cells), checkpoint
activation was induced by 6 h of hydroxyurea treatment, and then
the percent of P-H3 was analyzed. Treatment of these cells with
hydroxyurea for 6 h completely abolished DNA replication because
DNA content did not increase during this time (Supplementary
Data S2). NRK cells responded to hydroxyurea treatment, activating
the checkpoint response correctly and consequently inhibiting
mitotic entry (measured as P-H3–positive cells). As with asynchronous populations, UCN01 did not abrogate DNA replication
checkpoint activation in non-transformed cell lines (Fig. 2A). The

lack of formation of P-H2AX foci upon hydroxyurea treatment
indicated that no extensive DNA damage was produced either
when treating asynchronously growing cells with hydroxyurea for
24 h or S-phase cells with hydroxyurea for 6 h (Fig. 2B). The same
results were obtained with NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). To
ensure that hydroxyurea did not induce an irreversible arrest in
non-transformed cell lines, we confirmed that NRK cells could reenter the cell cycle upon hydroxyurea removal because they
synthesized DNA (6 h after hydroxyurea removal, more than 90% of
the cells incorporated BrdUrd) and entered mitosis (determined by
H3 phosphorylation; Fig. 2C).
In addition, the functionality of the hydroxyurea-induced
checkpoint response in the presence of either caffeine or Chk1
inhibitors was directly analyzed by testing the survival of the cells
using colony formation assays. S-phase NRK and HCT116 cells were
treated for 6 h with hydroxyurea to activate the checkpoint
response in the presence or absence of caffeine or UCN01. The
inhibitors were then washed out, and colony assays were done. As
shown in Fig. 2D, NRK cells had high viability after combined
treatment with DNA synthesis inhibitors plus caffeine or UCN01
(or even both together), confirming the presence of a Chk1- and
ATR/ATM-independent checkpoint response to DNA synthesis
inhibition in these cells that was not functional in the tumor cell
line HCT116.

Figure 1. Different effects of Chk1 inhibition and knockdown on the hydroxyurea-induced checkpoint response in non-tranformed cell lines and tumor cell lines.
A, the different asynchronous cell lines were treated, where indicated, with 1.5 mmol/L hydroxyurea (HU ) for 25 h. During the last 10 h of treatment, 5 mmol/L caffeine
(Caff ), 300 nmol/L UCN01 (UCN ), 10 Amol/L SB218078 (218078 ), or a combination of those drugs was added to the culture media. After treatment, cells were fixed,
and immunocytochemistry and LSC analysis were done to determine the percentage of P-H3–positive cells as indicated in Materials and Methods. Representative
experiments are shown (top graph , non-transformed cell lines; bottom graph, tumor cell lines). B, asynchronous NIH3T3 cells were transfected with siRNAs to
knock down Chk1 (Chk1i ) or GFP as a control (GFPi ). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the levels of Chk1 and actin were analyzed by Western blot (top left
for NIH3T3 cells). At that time, cells were also treated for 25 h with 1.5 mmol/L HU or nothing ( ), and during the last 10 h, where indicated, 5 mmol/L caffeine was
added (Caff). Top, microscope images of phospho-H3 (P-H3) immunostaining and propidium iodine (PI) staining of NIH3T3 cells are shown. Bottom, graph showing the
quantification of a representative experiment with NIH3T3 cells. Also included are HeLa cells as a positive control (22).

Chk1-Independent DNA Replication Checkpoint

Figure 2. UCN01 does not abrogate checkpoint responses to HU in synchronized NRK cells. A, S-phase synchronized NRK cells (16 h after activation by serum
addition) were treated for 6 h with the specified drugs. Cells were fixed at the indicated time after activation, and the percentage of P-H3–positive cells was analyzed by
immunocytochemistry and quantified by LSC. B, S synchronized NRK cells (left ) and asynchronously growing NRK cells (right ) were treated for 6 or 24 h with the
different drugs and immunostained to detect P-H2AX foci. C, S-phase synchronized NRK cells were treated with hydroxyurea for 6 h, and then the medium was
changed, and BrdUrd was added. At the times indicated after hydroxyurea removal, cells were fixed and processed for immunocytochemistry to detect P-H3 or
incorporated BrdUrd. D, S-phase synchronized NRK cells or S-phase synchronized HCT116 were treated for 6 h with the drugs. Viability was then determined by
clonogenic assay. Top, quantification of three different experiments; bottom, colonies obtained in a representative experiment. HU, 1.5 mmol/L hydroxyurea; Caff,

Decrease in cyclin B1 accumulation after hydroxyurea
treatment is ATR/ATM and Chk1 independent in non-transformed cell lines. We have previously shown that in cells with a
functional ATR/ATM-independent response to DNA synthesis
inhibition, such as NRK or NIH3T3, hydroxyurea treatment
inhibited the normal accumulation of cyclin B1 observed from
S phase to mitosis. This response was p53 independent because
p53 / cells showed the same behavior (20). In contrast, in cells
whose caffeine-insensitive checkpoint response was not functional,
like HCT116 cells, cyclin B1 continued to accumulate when DNA
synthesis was inhibited. We now tested whether this effect on
cyclin B1 accumulation induced by hydroxyurea treatment was
Chk1 independent in NRK cells. When S-phase NRK cells were
treated for 6 h with hydroxyurea, both Chk1 activation (determined
by its phosphorylation in Ser345) and inhibition of cyclin B1
accumulation were observed (Fig. 3A). Although the combined
hydroxyurea and caffeine treatment did not induce Chk1
phosphorylation, cyclin B1 levels were still low. Consequently,
hydroxyurea-induced inhibition of cyclin B1 accumulation and stop

www.aacrjournals.org

of mitotic entry may occur in the absence of Chk1 phosphorylation
at Ser345. Furthermore, Chk1 activity was not needed to inhibit
cyclin B1 accumulation in response to hydroxyurea treatment
because UCN01 addition did not abrogate the effect of hydroxyurea
on cyclin B1 levels (Fig. 3A). Similar results were also obtained
using synchronized NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3B).
p38A/B collaborates with Chk1 in the S/M checkpoint
response to hydroxyurea treatment. Participation of p38a and
p38h in parallel to Chk1 and Chk2 in the response to DNA
damage has already been described (12, 13, 25). Moreover, we
have previously shown that hydroxyurea treatment of S-phase
synchronized NRK cells induced activation of p38 (20). However,
the participation of p38 in the response to DNA replication
block in the absence of an extensive DNA damage has not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we tested whether p38
participated in the Chk1-independent checkpoint response to
DNA synthesis inhibition in NRK and NIH3T3. To this end, Sphase synchronized NRK and NIH3T3 cells were treated with
hydroxyurea plus caffeine, UCN01, or SB202190 (Sigma; an

inhibitor of p38a and p38h) alone or in combination, and the
percentage of P-H3–positive cells was analyzed. As shown in
Fig. 4A, none of the drugs on their own abrogated the
checkpoint response to hydroxyurea treatment ( functionality of
p38 inhibitor is shown in Supplementary Data S3). However, the
combination of UCN01 plus SB202190 disrupted the normal S/M
checkpoint response to hydroxyurea because after this treatment,
the percentage of P-H3–positive cells increased to the levels
observed in nontreated cells. Of course, those P-H3–positive cells
presented abnormal mitosis because DNA was condensing before
being fully replicated (Supplementary Data S4). Interestingly,
caffeine plus SB202190 treatment in the presence of hydroxyurea
did not abrogate the checkpoint, supporting the finding that
Chk1 can be activated independently of ATR/ATM activity (22).
The same results were obtained with another nonrelated p38a/h
inhibitor, SB203580 (Sigma; Supplementary Data S5). Consequently, these results showed that the simultaneous inhibition of
p38 and Chk1 in non-transformed cells was needed to abrogate
the correct S/M replication checkpoint response to hydroxyurea,
indicating a collaboration of Chk1 and p38a/h in this
checkpoint response.
In tumor cell lines (HCT116 and HeLa cells), UCN01 treatment
abrogated the checkpoint response (ref. 22 and Fig. 1A), but, as in
non-transformed cell lines, inhibition of p38 alone (SB202190
addition) did not (Fig. 4B).
Because p38 was participating in the cell cycle arrest induced by
hydroxyurea treatment in non-transformed but not in tumor cell
lines, phosphorylation of p38 measured upon hydroxyurea
treatment was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4C, in all cell lines
analyzed, either tumor or non-transformed cell lines, hydroxyurea
treatment induced p38 phosphorylation. Consequently, the lack of
functionality of the p38 pathway in these tumor cell lines was not
due to the lack of p38 activation.
Figure 4. Simultaneous inhibition of p38 and Chk1 abrogates the checkpoint
response to hydroxyurea in NRK and NIH3T3 cells. A, S-phase synchronized
(16 h after serum addition) NRK and NIH3T3 cells were treated for 6 h with

were fixed, and the percentage of P-H3–positive cells was analyzed by
immunocytochemistry and quantified by LSC. B, left, S-phase synchronized

the last 10 h. C, cells were treated (HU ) or not ( ) for 25 h with hydroxyurea.
They were then lysed, and phosphorylation of p38 (P-p38) was analyzed by
Western blotting. Actin was also analyzed as loading control. HU, 1.5 mmol/L

To further confirm p38 participation in the DNA replication
checkpoint in non-transformed cell lines, MEFs knocked out for
p38a were used (Fig. 5A). These p38a knocked out cells still had a
checkpoint response to hydroxyurea treatment even in the
presence of UCN01, but it was abrogated when UCN01 and
SB202190 were simultaneously added. The fact that p38 phosphorylation (indicative of its activity) and MK2 phosphorylation
(a substrate of p38 kinases) were induced by hydroxyurea in cells
lacking p38a indicated that p38h could probably be involved in the
checkpoint response (Fig. 5A and B). To finally prove the
collaboration between p38 and Chk1 in the hydroxyurea-induced
checkpoint response, p38a and p38h were knocked down in
NIH3T3 cells using siRNA. As shown in Fig. 5C, simultaneous

Chk1-Independent DNA Replication Checkpoint

knockdown of both p38a and p38h abrogated the checkpoint
response to hydroxyurea only when Chk1 was inhibited by UCN01
at the same time. Consistent with this idea, knocking down Chk1
by transfecting specific siRNA allowed hydroxyurea-treated cells to
enter mitosis only in the presence of the p38a/h inhibitor
SB202190. To prove that p38a and p38h siRNA treatment was in
fact knocking down any isoform of p38 that could be activated by
hydroxyurea treatment, phosphorylation of p38 was analyzed by
Western blotting (Fig. 5C). Only when p38 was not phosphorylated
could UCN01 treatment abrogate the S/M checkpoint response to
hydroxyurea. All these results confirmed a collaboration between
p38a/h and Chk1 to inhibit mitotic entry in response to DNA
synthesis inhibition.
Chk1 and p38 collaborate to inhibit CyclinB1/Cdk1 activity
upon hydroxyurea treatment but are not essential to downregulate cyclin B1 levels. Unexpectedly, although hydroxyureatreated cells were entering mitosis upon UCN01 plus SB202190

addition, cyclin B1 levels did not recover in response to this
treatment (Fig. 6A). Thus, although they entered mitosis, S-phase
NRK cells (16 h) treated with hydroxyurea plus UCN01 and
SB202190 for 6 h presented the same low levels of cyclin B1
observed before treatment at 16 h. Analyzing cyclin B1/Cdk1
activity in those cells, we saw that hydroxyurea treatment inhibited
the activation of this complex. Although further addition of UCN01
or SB202190 alone in the presence of hydroxyurea did not recover
activity, it was partially recovered when a combination of the two
inhibitors was added (Fig. 6B). In contrast, and confirming the fact
that Chk1 inhibition abrogated the checkpoint response in HCT116
cells, UCN01 treatment alone recovered cyclin B1–associated
kinase activity of hydroxyurea-treated HCT116 cells (Fig. 6B).
Recovery of cyclin B1 activity observed in NRK by the addition of
UCN01 and SB202190 was not complete, but it was stronger if
we compare cyclin B1 kinase–associated activity to the total
amount of cyclin B1 in each condition (Fig. 6C). Moreover, most

P-H3–positive NRK cells observed in UCN01, SB202190, and
hydroxyurea-treated cells also had disrupted nuclear lamina,
indicating that Cdk1 was in fact active (Supplementary Data
S6A). Furthermore, nuclear localization of cyclin B1 was only
observed in control conditions and upon simultaneous inhibition
of Chk1 and p38a/h (Supplementary Data S6B). We conclude then
that in NRK cells, Chk1 and p38 work in parallel to inhibit cyclin
B1/Cdk1 complex nuclear accumulation and activation, but that
some other factor is responsible for the down-regulation of cyclin
B1 expression. In cells treated with hydroxyurea during the S phase,
the amount of cyclin B1 present in each cell may have been enough
to allow Cdk1 activation and, consequently, mitotic entry, when
Chk1 and p38a/h were inhibited. To prove this, hydroxyurea was
added to NRK cells 10 h after activation from quiescence, when
most cells had not yet entered S phase and consequently had
undetectable levels of cyclin B1. In this case hydroxyurea inhibited
cell cycle just at the beginning of the S phase (G1-S transition, 2n
DNA content), and posterior addition of UCN01 plus SB202190 did
not abrogate the checkpoint response (Supplementary Data S7 for
NRK and data not shown for NIH3T3 cells).

We have previously shown that low levels of cyclin B1 upon
hydroxyurea treatment correlated with a decrease in cyclin B1
mRNA levels. We now aimed to analyze whether this occurred in
parallel to a decrease in promoter activity, and whether, as
expected from the above results, this regulation was independent
of Chk1 and p38 activity. As shown in Fig. 6D, hydroxyurea
treatment inhibited cyclin B1 promoter activity by more than 50%,
and neither caffeine, UCN01, nor SB202190, whether alone or in
combination, was able to reverse the effect. This indicated that
ATR/ATM, Chk1, and p38 were dispensable for down-regulating
cyclin B1 promoter activity upon DNA synthesis inhibition.
Interestingly, in HCT116 cells, which do not show a decrease in
cyclin B1 protein levels with hydroxyurea treatment (20), cyclin B1
promoter activity was not down-regulated by hydroxyurea
treatment (Supplementary Data S8).

Discussion
Here we analyze the response of non-transformed cell lines to
DNA synthesis inhibition induced by hydroxyurea treatment. Our

and SB202190. S-phase synchronized NRK cells (16 h after serum addition) were treated with the specified drugs for 6 h. A, top and bottom , at the indicated time
after serum addition, cells were lysed and processed to analyze levels of cyclin B1 (CycB1 ) and actin by Western blotting. A representative experiment out of three is
shown. B, cells were processed for immunoprecipitation (IP ) to analyze cyclin B1 (anti-CycB1)–associated H1 kinase activity. Nonrelated mouse IgG was used as
immunoprecipitation control (mIgG ). A representative experiment out of three is shown. Bottom, cyclin B1–associated kinase activity of HCT116-synchronized cells
after the same treatments is shown. C, the ratio cyclin B1-associated H1 kinase activity of NRK cells versus total levels of cyclin B1 from three different experiments,
as in A and B, was determined. The graph shows the variation of this ratio with respect to the value obtained in mitotic cells (22 h after activation; 100% value).

Chk1-Independent DNA Replication Checkpoint

data indicate that in non-transformed mammalian cell lines, the
checkpoint response is more complex and robust than has been
shown up to now using tumor cell lines. Although in tumor cell
lines (2, 17), embryonic stem cells (26–28), and nonmammalian
cells (29, 30), Chk1 has been reported to be an essential kinase for
the DNA replication checkpoint, in all non-transformed mammal
cell lines used in this study, additional parallel pathways were
found that ensure replication checkpoint response when Chk1 and
ATR/ATM are not functional.
Most checkpoints activate non-transcriptional fast responses
and also delayed transcriptional checkpoint responses that are
needed to maintain a longer effect (7, 31). Results presented in this
paper, together with our previous results, show that upon DNA
replication inhibition, there are transcriptional and non-transcriptional ATR/ATM- and Chk1-independent responses. When DNA
synthesis is inhibited in NRK or NIH3T3 cells, we observe features
that indicate cell cycle arrest and, consequently, mitotic entry
inhibition (activation of S/M checkpoint): lack of cyclin B1
accumulation, lack of nuclear translocation of the preexisting
cyclin B1, inhibition of cyclin B1/Cdk1 activation, inhibition of
lamina disaggregation, inhibition of H3 phosphorylation, and lack
of chromatin condensation. None of these features were abrogated
by the exclusive inhibition of Chk1 or ATR and ATM. In contrast,
Chk1 inhibition abrogated all these S/M checkpoint responses in all
tumor cell lines analyzed here. However, the dependence of the
intra-S checkpoint response upon DNA inhibition on Chk1 has not
been analyzed here.
We analyzed here whether the p38 stress-activated kinase, which
participates in DNA damage and osmotic stress cellular responses
(10, 12–14, 25, 32), may also participate in the cellular response to
DNA synthesis inhibition. Inhibition of p38 alone did not abrogate
any of these checkpoint responses, but simultaneous inhibition of
both Chk1 and p38 allowed cells treated with hydroxyurea in S phase
to enter mitosis. Although cyclin B1 protein levels did not increase,
we observed an increase in cyclin B1–associated kinase activity
when compared with hydroxyurea-treated cells. It is well known that
when DNA replication is inhibited, Chk1 activation induces
phosphorylation and inhibition of the Cdc25 phosphatase family
(6). Consequently, cyclin B1/Cdk1 complexes cannot be activated,
and mitotic entry is inhibited. Our data indicate that in nontransformed cell lines, p38a/h and Chk1 collaborate to prevent
cyclin B1–associated kinase activity upon DNA synthesis inhibition.
It has previously been shown that MK2, one of the p38 substrates, is
activated upon osmotic stress and UV light irradiation and, in
response to DNA-damaging agents, inhibits Cdc25 (11, 12, 14, 25).
Here, we show that hydroxyurea addition induces p38 and MK2
phosphorylation. Consequently, p38/MK2 might collaborate with
Chk1 to inhibit the activation of Cdc25 and, thus, cyclin B1/Cdk1 in
response to hydroxyurea. However, p38 may inhibit cyclin B1–
associated kinase activity via other mechanisms. Reinhardt et al.
(25), using MEF p53 / or U2OS cells, found that upon DNA damage,
the inhibition of MK2 alone is able to abrogate the DNA damage
checkpoint response. Those results would agree with ours if MK2
could be activated also by Chk1.
Another open question is how DNA synthesis inhibition activates
p38. Although activation of p38 by DNA damaging agents has been
shown to be ATM/ATR dependent (25, 33) and correlates with the
appearance of P-H2AX foci, our data indicate that p38 is activated
by hydroxyurea even in the presence of caffeine and in the absence
of these P-H2AX foci. Changes in chromatin topology, induced, for
instance, by topoisomerase II and histone deacetylase inhibitors,

www.aacrjournals.org

also delay G2-M transition by triggering the p38 checkpoint
pathway (34). It is possible that DNA synthesis inhibition also
induces chromatin topology changes, leading to the activation of
p38 in parallel to ATR and Chk1.
We also show here the existence of a second Chk1-independent
response, which leads to cyclin B1 promoter down-regulation. Our
data indicate that, in non-transformed fibroblasts, DNA synthesis
inhibition induces a decrease in cyclin B1 promoter activity that is
not reversed by caffeine addition, Chk1, or p38 inhibition, either
alone or in combination. This response would only be important to
inhibit mitosis entry in cells that have been arrested at the very
beginning of the S phase, when the cyclin B1 levels have not yet
increased, because, as indicated above, low levels of cyclin B1 may
allow mitosis entry. Transcriptional regulation of cyclin B1 gene
(8, 35, 36), as well as regulation of cyclin B1 mRNA stability (37)
during the cell cycle, has been reported. We have also previously
shown that Claspin down-regulates cyclin B1 expression in HeLa
cells (22). Further investigation is needed to elucidate the link
between DNA synthesis inhibition and cyclin B1 promoter activity,
but interestingly, this is a checkpoint response that is not
functional in some tumor cell lines (20).
Because checkpoint signaling pathways facilitate cell survival
following DNA damage in human cells, there is great interest in
combining checkpoint inhibitors with genotoxic anticancer treatments as a means to enhance tumor susceptibility. In fact, it has been
reported in several preclinical and clinical studies that inhibition of
Chk1 enhances the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy (38).
We have shown here that although Chk1 is an essential DNA
replication checkpoint kinase in tumor cell lines, it is not essential in
non-transformed cell lines. Consequently, Chk1 inhibition drastically
enhances the cytotoxic effect of hydroxyurea treatment in HCT116
cells, as determined by clonogenic assays, whereas hardly any effect
was observed in NRK cells. Blocking DNA replication has been a
major target for anticancer therapy, and new ribonucleotide
reductase inhibitors have been tested and applied in clinical practice
(39). Among the different types of ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors
developed at the moment, some are nucleoside analogues that also
induce DNA damage because they are incorporated into DNA as, for
instance, 5-fluorouracil. In this study, we have used hydroxyurea to
activate replication checkpoint. Hydroxyurea is a radical scavenger
that inactivates ribonucleotide reductase, and because it does not
incorporate into DNA, DNA damage induced by hydroxyurea is lower.
Although clinical application of hydroxyurea is reduced, other radical
scavengers have been developed and are in phase I and II clinical
trials ( for example, Didox and Tridox). In conclusion, our data
showing that nontumor cells have Chk1-independent checkpoint
responses to DNA replication inhibition that are not functional in
tumor cells provide a rationale for tumor-selective effects of
combined therapies.
