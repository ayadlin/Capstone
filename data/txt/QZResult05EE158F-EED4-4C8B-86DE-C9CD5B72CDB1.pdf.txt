BACKGROUND: Sequential bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and electromotive mitomycin (sequential therapy) have been shown in a
randomized prospective trial to be superior to therapy with BCG alone in patients with high-risk non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
The objective of the current study was to compare the costs and benefits of these 2 treatment strategies by performing a 5-year and
10-year cost-effectiveness study. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
over a 5-year and 10-year period. Estimates of disease progression, death, and treatment efficacy were obtained from what to the
authors’ knowledge is the only randomized trial comparing the 2 therapies. Costs included: 1) medical costs (physician fees); 2) drug
costs (preparation and instillation); and 3) hospital costs (procedure fees, admission fees, and tests and procedures done during surveillance). Patients were allowed a second course of induction therapy. RESULTS: Sequential therapy was found to be associated with
a higher initial material cost for induction and maintenance. The average effectiveness for the patients treated with therapy with BCG
alone was 4.39 years with a mean cost of $9236 (95% confidence interval, $9118-$9345) per patient. The sequential group resulted in
an average effectiveness of 4.65 years, with a mean cost of $16,468 (95% confidence interval, $16,371-$16,527). The 5-year incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio of sequential versus BCG-alone therapy was $27,815 per life-year gained. The corresponding figure over a 10year period was $8618 per life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that sequential therapy is a

INTRODUCTION
Intravesical chemotherapy and immunotherapy have become essential components in the treatment paradigm of patients
with non–muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (NMIBC).1 Although intravesical chemotherapy with
agents such as mitomycin (MMC) has been shown to reduce disease recurrence, maintenance therapy with bacillus
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was for a long time the only treatment that had been shown to reduce both disease recurrence
and progression.1 Because failures to both types of treatments remain common, urologists continue to search for better
therapies. Although several drugs and treatment combinations continue to be investigated, to the best of our knowledge
only 1 therapy to date has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to be superior to BCG alone in the treatment of
patients with high-risk NMIBC.2 In 2006, Di Stasi et al published the results of their trial demonstrating the superiority
of sequential therapy with BCG and electromotive MMC (EMDA) versus BCG alone in patients with high-risk NMIBC,
with all study endpoints significantly in favor of sequential therapy (Table 1).2 This study indicated that over a median
follow-up of 88 months (interquartile range [IQR] 63 months-110 months), patients assigned to treatment with

sequential BCG and EMDA had a higher disease-free
interval than those assigned to BCG alone (absolute difference between groups of 48 months [IQR, 42 months54 months]; log-rank P 5 .0012). In addition, patients
assigned to receive sequential BCG and EMDA also had

to increase efficacy, and the theory behind this improved
efficacy is that BCG-induced inflammation of the bladder
urothelium potentially results in better penetration of
MMC via EMDA into the bladder wall. Although this
trial clearly identified a superior treatment, to the best of
our knowledge no study to date has investigated the economic impact of incorporating sequential therapy from a
payer’s perspective. This is important because current economic conditions and cost constraints continue to play a
vital role in all aspects of the medical decision-making
process. Due to the superiority of this new treatment
among patients with high-risk NMIBC and our interest
in incorporating it into the hospital budget as a therapeutic option, we decided to perform an economic evaluation
to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of these 2
treatment strategies in light of the recent approval by
Health Canada (in addition to approval from health agencies from several other countries) for the EMDA technology and delivery approach of intravesical MMC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

was constructed to determine the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) and health economic impact of
incorporating sequential therapy (Fig. 1) as a treatment alternative for patients with high-risk NMIBC. Patient

characteristics were assumed to be similar to those in the
study by Di Stasi et al,2 with 18.7% of the patients being
women and a median age among patients of 67 years.
Because no difference was observed between the patients
treated with BCG alone and those receiving sequential
therapy in terms of adverse events, the cost-effectiveness
analysis was considered more appropriate than a costutility analysis. The general accepted threshold of ICER is
a range of $50,000 to $100,000 per life-year gained.4 Estimates for annual rates of disease progression and death as
well as treatment efficacy were obtained using the data
from the single randomized trial by Di Stasi et al comparing both treatment strategies.2 Our model was built with a
5-year and 10-year time horizon. Induction and maintenance therapy followed the same protocol used in the
study by Di Stasi et al,2 differing from the maintenance
schedule of the Southwest Oncology Group protocol.5
Patients receiving therapy with BCG alone received
weekly instillations of BCG as an induction course for 6
weeks, followed by 1 monthly instillation of BCG as
maintenance for a total of 10 months. Patients receiving
sequential therapy received weekly instillations of BCG
for 2 weeks followed by 1 weekly instillation of EMDA as
1 cycle for 3 cycles as an induction course (9 weeks total).
This was followed by monthly instillations of EMDA for
2 months and 1 monthly instillation of BCG for 1 month
as 1 cycle for 3 cycles as maintenance thereafter (9 months
total). Patients were allowed to receive a second course of
induction therapy. Reevaluation was performed every 3
months for the first 3 years, and then every 6 months for
the following 2 years. Patients who developed disease recurrence at a similar or lower stage were assumed to
undergo transurethral resection. Patients from both
groups who failed therapy and developed disease progression and were still alive were assumed to receive a radical
cystectomy. A death state was integrated into our model.
The Markov model3 is a health state transition
model that started at the initiation of treatment as
described above. A cycle length of 3 months was used.
The model measured disease recurrences, disease progression, and death within the 5-year and 10-year periods for all patients, and it comprised the following
health states: 1) reinduction; 2) radical cystectomy (disease progression requiring radical cystectomy); 3) transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) (disease
recurrence without disease progression); 4) maintenance
(patients without disease recurrence or progression); and
5) death. Death is an absorbing state. Patients could
remain in the same state for > 1 Markov cycle. The effectiveness measure (outcome) considered in the analysis

was the life-years gained, which is equivalent to the overall survival. Results of the clinical trial (disease-free survival, progression-free survival, overall survival, and
disease-specific survival) were used to derive the 3month probabilities of undergoing reinduction, of
undergoing radical cystectomy, of undergoing TURBT,
of remaining in a maintenance state (free of disease progression or recurrence), and of death. As per the study by
Di Stasi et al,2 patients were withdrawn from the trial at
the time of a second disease recurrence, if there was persistent carcinoma in situ, if carcinoma developed in the
upper urinary tract or prostatic urethra, if disease progressed to muscle-invasive disease (ie, pT2 or more
advanced disease), or if metastasis developed; further
treatment was left to the discretion of the local investigator. Therefore, only the first TURBT or radical cystectomy event after the maintenance state was accounted
for by the model. The derived probabilities are presented
in Table 2. In addition, because no distinction was made
between mortality from different health states, the probability of death from TURBT and radical cystectomy
was derived from the probability of mortality after cystectomy as reported by Kulkarni et al.6 The models were
built using TreeAge Pro 2013 statistical software
(Release 13.1.1.0, TreeAge Software Inc, Williamstown,
Mass).
Cost Assignments

Calculated costs included: 1) medical costs (physician
fees); 2) drug costs (cost of drug, its preparation, and
instillation); and 3) hospital costs (procedure and admission fees and cost of tests and procedures performed during surveillance). All cost assignments were in Canadian
dollars and were estimated from the 2013 Quebec public
health system perspective. Medical and hospital costs were

Cost analyses

Patients’ outcomes and associated costs of 10,000 incident
subjects who were assigned to receive sequential therapy
or BCG alone were simulated over the first year and 5
years and 10 years of follow-up by applying the corresponding Markov models. The mean cost per patient is
the average of individual cost estimations obtained with
Monte Carlo microsimulations. The 95% confidence

interval (95% CI) for the mean cost was obtained through
simulation of 1000 samples of equal sample size of 10,000
simulated cases. To reflect the time value, a standard discount rate of 5% was used on both the outcomes and
costs.10
Sensitivity analysis

Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the
robustness of the results with regard to variations in key
parameters considered in our model, specifically a discount rate of 3%, a 5% and 10%, reinduction rate in the

and a disease progression rate in the sequential therapy
group (increased or decreased probability by 25%). In
addition, costs specific to other health care systems
(namely Ontario and British Columbia, Canada; the
United States; and the United Kingdom) were used to test
the generalizability of this study. Specific analyses are presented in Table 4.11
RESULTS
After a 5-year period, 13.5% of the patients in the group
receiving sequential therapy died, 5.5% underwent radical
cystectomy, and 17.8% of patients underwent TURBT.
The corresponding values in the patients treated with
BCG alone were 20.6% of patients died, 18.8% underwent radical cystectomy, and 25.62% of patients underwent TURBT. Results of the analysis performed over the
10-year period demonstrated that 32.5% and 22.1% of
patients in the BCG-alone and sequential therapy groups,
respectively, had died. In addition, the corresponding disease progression rates were 25.8% and 7.0%, respectively,
among the patients in the BCG-alone and sequential therapy groups, with a total recurrence rate (with or without
disease progression) of 58.0% and 39.5%, respectively.
The initial costs of induction and maintenance for both
groups are presented in Table 3. Sequential therapy is
associated with an increased initial cost of both induction
and maintenance, and this does not include the $7000
cost of purchasing the EMDA delivery machine. When
these initial costs and other costs were integrated into our
Markov model and simulated over a 5-year period, it
resulted in an average effectiveness for the BCG group of
2428

4.39 years (95% CI, 4.36 years-4.42 years), with a mean
cost of $9236 (95% CI, $9118-$9345). With regard to
the sequential therapy group, this resulted in an average
effectiveness of 4.65 years (95% CI, 4.62 years-4.66
years), with a mean cost of $16,468 (95% CI, $16,371$16,527). When one treatment strategy was deemed more
effective yet was also more expensive, the ICER was calculated to determine the benefit of using one treatment over
the other. The ICER was the difference in cost divided by
the difference in effectiveness. In the current study, the 5year ICER was calculated at $27,815 per life-year gained
for the sequential therapy group versus the BCG-alone
group.
Over the 10-year period, the average effectiveness
was 7.58 years (95% CI, 7.53 years-7.66 years) in the
BCG-alone group and 8.40 years (95% CI, 8.35 years8.47 years) in the sequential therapy group, with a mean
cost of $11,588 (95% CI, $11,428-$11,661) and
$18,655 (95% CI, $18,599-$18,803), respectively. Consequently, the 10-year ICER was estimated at $8618 per
life-year gained.
Sensitivity Analysis

The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Table 4. The 5-year ICER varied from $5419 to $33,142
per life-year gained, whereas the 10-year ICER varied
from $594 to $10,874 per life-year gained.
DISCUSSION
Sequential therapy is associated with a higher cost of treatment compared with BCG therapy, but is more effective.

Cost-Effectiveness of BCG and eMMC/Bachir et al

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of incorporating
this treatment is calculated at $27,815 per life-year
gained, which is well below the accepted threshold of
$50,000 to $100,000 per life-year gained4 that was initially defined in 1992, but that may currently be accepted
as even higher as reported by Eichler et al in 2004,12
allowing for the possible integration of sequential therapy
into treatment options for patients with high-risk
NMIBC. Our models simulate outcomes that are very
similar to those reported in the clinical trial by Di Stasi
et al,2 thus demonstrating the validation of the model.
Over the 10-year period, the simulated rates of death were
32.5% and 22.1%, respectively, in the BCG-alone and sequential therapy groups compared with rates of 32.4%
and 21.5%, respectively, reported in the clinical trial.2
Furthermore, the simulated disease progression rates were
25.8% and 7.0%, respectively, in BCG-alone and sequential therapy groups compared with 25.0% and 6.3%,
respectively, as reported in the clinical trial.2 In addition,
the results of the sensitivity analysis were similar to the
base case results, thereby demonstrating the stability of
the results obtained with these models.
Budget limitations will continue to dictate which
types of treatments receive government funding. With a
trend toward cost containment in all aspects of medicine,
this will invariably affect the treatment of patients with
bladder cancer because research into this disease is already
one of the most underfunded.13 For this reason, it is of
utmost importance for urologists to perform costeffectiveness studies on new and emerging therapies in
bladder cancer to convince health officials to fund these
various treatments. Ultimately however, despite cost analysis studies and supporting evidence, it is the responsibility of the treating physicians to integrate these novel
therapies into their daily armamentarium. One example
of a novel urologic therapy that, although it has been
shown to be effective in randomized trials and has also
proven to be cost-effective, continues to be underused, is
the immediate post-TURBT intravesical chemotherapy
instillation.14,15 Although a recent meta-analysis reconfirmed the efficacy of this therapy in reducing disease recurrence among patients with NIMBC,16 and despite its
endorsement by the American, Canadian, and European
guidelines alike,1,17,18 recent evidence points to the continued worldwide underuse of a post-TURBT administration of chemotherapy.19-21 In addition to cost and the
urologist’s perception of the added value in the absence of
disease progression/survival benefit, there may be other
barriers to the adoption of a postoperative dose of chemotherapy. In some hospitals, logistic restrictions may make
Cancer

it impossible to administer a postoperative chemotherapeutic medication in the recovery room. Furthermore,
nursing staff in the recovery room are often not trained in
the administration of chemotherapy, and this may further
restrict the use of a post-TURBT dose of chemotherapy.
Therefore, despite its proven efficacy, it may rest with
urologists to incorporate sequential therapy into their regular practice to avoid the underuse of yet another effective
treatment. With recent approval from Health Canada,
this trend may change in Canada, yet with no approval for
use in the United States, it will likely remain difficult for
sequential therapy to be used in American institutions.
However, it is important to keep in mind that because the
randomized trial was published nearly 8 years ago, cost is
most likely not the only reason why more centers have still
not adopted sequential therapy. The finding that no further trials validating the efficacy of sequential therapy
have been published to date may have made it difficult for
this treatment to gain wider acceptance.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first costeffectiveness study comparing these 2 treatment strategies,
with the results revealing a 5-year ICER of $27,815 and a
10-year ICER of $8618 per life-year gained for sequential
therapy versus therapy with BCG alone. It is interesting to
note that this is significantly less than the ICER for other
more established oncologic treatments in urology, including sunitinib for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which
has a reported ICER of $67,215 per life-year gained versus
interferon-a,22 as well as abiraterone for metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer, with an ICER of
$91,200 per life-year gained versus mitoxantrone.23
Moreover, the 10-year ICER of $8618 is also well below
the lower limit of $50,000 that society is willing to reimburse for therapy. As such, this strongly supports the case
(from an economic standpoint) for adopting sequential
therapy as a standard of care for patients with high-risk
NMIBC. Furthermore, the maintenance strategy of the
patients receiving BCG alone in the study by Di Stasi et al
was found to result in a lower number of BCG instillations being used compared with the Southwest Oncology
Group protocol (11 fewer therapies administered per
patient)2 and as such, this would translate into an even
lower cost-effectiveness ratio in favor of sequential therapy. However, the opposite may also be true in that a longer BCG maintenance schedule may make the BCG-only
arm more effective (lower rates of disease progression/recurrence) and the sequential therapy arm therefore less
cost-effective. Nevertheless, the 5-year outcomes reported
by Lamm et al for BCG maintenance5 among a lower-risk
patient population (considered as such because it included
2429

Original Article

a mixture of patients with Ta and T1 disease, unlike the
population in the study by Di Stasi et al,2 which included
only patients with high-risk T1 disease) indicated a disease
recurrence rate of 40%, a disease progression rate of 24%,
and overall mortality rate of 17%, which are similar to
those observed at 5 years by Di Stasi et al (33%, 25%, and
22%, respectively).2
It is well known that the cost of individual drugs
varies significantly from one country to another, and this
depends on several factors including manufacturing and
importing costs as well as the presence of generic medications. In the current study, there was a substantial discrepancy in cost noted between BCG and MMC, making
sequential therapy significantly more expensive. Furthermore, the cost of MMC within the model was based on Canadian prices, which are also significantly higher than those
in several other countries, including the United States and
Italy. In 2 separate studies from the United States, the cost
of a single dose of MMC was reported as $241 and $312,
respectively.24,25 In a study from Italy, the cost of a single
instillation of MMC was calculated at e178.26 These costs
demonstrate the significant additional expense of MMC in
Canada, and there is no doubt that substantial cost savings
can be further incurred in countries such as the United
States, in which MMC is much less expensive.
There are several limitations to the current study, the
majority of which are inherent to cost analysis studies. First,
the costs were derived from RAMQ lists and our own hospital pharmacy records and as such, it is unclear whether the
results can be accurately extrapolated to other countries or
even other provinces within Canada. Furthermore, medical
costs such as physician fees do vary between provinces and
countries, and this may further limit the generalizability of
the results of the current study. Second, this model did not
account for costs associated with side effects or complications
nor quality of life as related to treatments. Indirect costs such
as time off work and lost productivity were also not considered. The principal limitation of the current study, as well as
others using modeling, is the reliance on estimates from a
single randomized trial and therefore it is unclear how valid
these results can be expected to be in reality.

Conclusions

Based on our cost analysis, the 10-year ICER of adopting
sequential therapy over therapy with BCG alone for
patients with high-risk NMIBC is estimated at $8618 per
life-year gained. These data suggest that sequential therapy can be potentially integrated into hospital and health
systems as a standard of care, with the cost-effectiveness
2430

ratio well below the threshold of $50,000 to $100,000
that is deemed acceptable to society.
