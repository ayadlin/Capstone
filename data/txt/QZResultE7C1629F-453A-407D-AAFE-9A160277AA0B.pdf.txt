BACKGROUND: Patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma have achieved longer survival over the past decades, but late side
effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy have become important concerns. METHODS: The authors reviewed all patients with localized osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma who had been enrolled in the Italian Sarcoma Group neoadjuvant protocols from 1983 through
2006. Data were updated in December 2010 to determine 3 endpoints: the incidence of a secondary primary cancer (designated as
‘‘second malignant neoplasm’’ [SMN]), infertility, and cardiotoxicity. RESULTS: Data were available on 883 patients with osteosarcoma
and 543 patients with Ewing sarcoma. In the osteosarcoma group, there were 39 SMNs (4.4%) in 36 patients; in the Ewing sarcoma
group, 15 patients (2.8%) experienced a single SMN each. The cumulative 10-year and 20-year incidence of an SMN (standard error)
was 4.9%  0.9% and 6.1%  1.2%, respectively, in the osteosarcoma group and 3.4%  0.9% and 4.7%  1.6%, respectively, in the Ewing
sarcoma group. The most common SMN in the osteosarcoma group was breast cancer (n ¼ 11), and the most common SMN in
the Ewing sarcoma group was radiotherapy-induced osteosarcoma (n ¼ 6). After 20 years, the risk of developing an SMN increased,
whereas the risk of a recurrence of the primary tumor decreased. Permanent sterility was more common in males than in
females. Doxorubicin cardiotoxicity occurred in 18 patients with osteosarcoma (2%) and in 7 patients with Ewing sarcoma (1.3%).

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are rare tumors that are more common in pediatric and adolescent age groups. In the
past few decades, long-term survival in affected patients has improved as a result of the success of multimodal therapy;
today, the 10-year survival rate has reached approximately 50%.1 However, long-term survival is sometimes complicated
by the late side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Investigators with the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study2 calculated the overall effects of primary childhood cancer
and its treatment on the life expectancy of survivors. They calculated that the life expectancy of a group of patients aged 15
years who had survived for 5 years was 50.6 years. They determined that this figure represented a loss of life expectancy of
10.4 years (17.1%) compared with the general population. The average reduction in life expectancy ranged from 4 years
among kidney cancer survivors to >17 years among brain and bone cancer survivors. In addition, those investigators estimated that 1 in 4 survivors would be expected to die of either a late recurrence of the primary cancer, a second malignant
neoplasm (SMN), or a cardiac condition. We previously reported the results from long-term side effects of earlier adjuvant
treatments in patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.1,3 In this article, we report the incidence of SMN, infertility, and doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma patients who had localized disease at
diagnosis after treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

aged 40 years. Patients who met our inclusion criteria,
which were described in the articles cited above, were registered at the operations office of the Rizzoli Institute. The
diagnosis of osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma was

confirmed by a pathologist experienced in bone sarcoma.
Eligible patients entered into active treatment protocols
after providing informed consent. Member institutions
submitted biannual follow-up reports on all enrolled
patients. These reports included information on survival,
disease status, development of a second malignancy, cardiotoxicity, and fertility status. An SMN was defined as a
cancer of a histologic type distinct from the primary bone
sarcoma histiotype. Cardiotoxicity was defined as a left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%; early toxicity
was defined as toxicity that occurred during or soon after
the completion of chemotherapy (0-2 months); late cardiotoxicity was defined as cardiopathy that occurred after 2
months; and infertility was defined according to Common
Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0—that is,
oligo/azospermia for males and permanent amenorrhea
for females. For patients who had not been seen during
the previous 3 years, a telephone call was made by the
oncologist researcher. The date of the last follow-up was
December 31, 2010. The results from those trials have
been published.4-14
The Rizzoli Ewing neoadjuvant 3 (REN-3) trial protocol for Ewing sarcoma enrolled 157 patients, and it
ended in 1997. However, from 1997 to 1999, when the
subsequent ISG/Scandinavian Study Group (SSG) III
protocol was initiated, 29 additional patients received the
same REN-3 treatment, and they were included in this
analysis, bringing the total number of patients in this protocol to 186 (Table 2)
For the patients who developed an SNM, the date of
diagnosis, the tumor’s histologic characteristics, and the
tumor site were recorded. Also recorded was the interval
between the date that the primary sarcoma was diagnosed
and the date that the SMN was diagnosed.

RESULTS
Our cohort consisted of 883 patients with osteosarcoma
(508 males and 375 females) who were ages 1 to 40 years
at diagnosis (median age, 15 years) and 543 patients with
Ewing sarcoma (337 males and 206 females) who were
ages 1 to 40 years at diagnosis (median age, 16 years).
Osteosarcoma Cohort

In total, 898 patients were enrolled on the 7 osteosarcoma
protocols from January 1983 through December 2006. In
this group, 15 patients (1.7%) were lost to follow-up,
leaving 883 evaluable patients.
At study’s end, 573 patients remained alive (342
males and 231 females), and 310 patients had died (166
males and 144 females). Of the 310 patients who died,
280 died of osteosarcoma, 16 died of SMN, 6 died of
acute chemotherapy toxicity, 6 died of cardiotoxicity, and
2 died of other causes (1 pulmonary embolism and 1 suicide). Of the 573 patients who remained alive, we were
unable to contact 45 patients for follow-up, but we know
that they indeed were alive at their last follow-up 3 years
earlier. These 45 patients had a follow-up of at least of 10
years (median follow-up, 131 month; range, 41-244
months), and they were included in this analysis with the
assumption that they were alive and disease free at the
time of the study (December 2010).
The overall median follow-up for the entire group
of 883 patients with osteosarcoma was 126 months
(range, 1-327 months). The median follow-up for the
573 patients who remained alive was 142 months (range,
41-327 months), and the median overall survival for the
310 patients who died was 33 months (range, 1-253
months). The 10-year, 20-year, and 25-year cumulative
mortality rates (standard error) from recurrent osteosarcoma were 39%  1.8%, 40%  1.9%, and 50%  2%,
respectively (Fig. 1).

Statistical Analysis

Ewing Sarcoma Cohort

Overall survival was calculated from the first day of chemotherapy until death or the most recent follow-up. Survival curves were calculated according to the KaplanMeier method. The cumulative incidences of recurrent
primary tumors and SMNs were calculated separately
according to the method described by Kalbfleisch and
Prentice,15 in which death from any cause that occurred
before an SMN was considered a competing risk. The
time during which a patient was at risk of developing an
SMN was calculated from the date of the primary sarcoma
diagnosis to the date of the SMN diagnosis, the date of
death, or the date of the most recent follow-up, whichever
was earliest.

In total, 581 patients were enrolled in 4 Ewing sarcoma
protocols from 1983 through 2006. Of these, 38 patients
(6.5%) were lost to follow-up, leaving 543 evaluable
patients. At study’s end, 323 patients remained alive (200
males and 123 females), and 220 patients had died (137
males and 83 females). Of the 220 patients who died, 212
died of Ewing sarcoma, 5 died of SMN, and 3 died of
acute complications; none died of cardiopathy. Of the
323 patients who remained alive, 19 had not made a follow-up visit during the preceding 3 years, and they could
not be reached by telephone or mail. For the purposes of
the current analysis, they were considered to be alive and
disease-free at the time of their most recent follow-up.

The overall median follow-up for the entire group
of 543 patients with Ewing sarcoma was 86 months
(range, 1-330 months). The median follow-up for the
323 patients who remained alive was 141 months (range,
9-334 months), and the median overall survival for the
220 patients who died was 25 months (range, 1-22
months). The cumulative mortality rate (standard error)
from the primary cancer, including recurrence, was
54%  2.6% at 10 years, 58%  1.9% at 20 years, and
61%  2.4% at 25 years (Fig. 2).
Of all 543 patients, 276 received radiotherapy (145
received radiotherapy to an axial bone, and 131 received
radiotherapy to an extremity) either alone or combined
with chemotherapy. Among the 188 patients in the ISG/
SSG III protocol, 79 received high-dose chemotherapy
(HDCT) with busulfan and melphalan followed by peripheral blood stem cell rescue.

Osteosarcoma cohort

In total, 39 SMNs were identified in 36 patients
with osteosarcoma (Table 3). This group included 20
females and 16 males. Among the SMNs were 11 breast
cancers (10 females and 1 male), 9 leukemias, 5 sarcomas
(4 soft tissue sarcomas and 1 Ewing sarcoma), 3 parotid

cancers, 2 non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 2 colon cancers, 2
central nervous system cancers, 1 squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, 1 melanoma, 1 renal cancer, 1 thyroid
cancer, and 1 ovarian cancer (Table 3).
The median interval from the diagnosis of osteosarcoma to the diagnosis of an SMN was 96 months (range,
15-270 months). The median interval was 34.5 months
(range, 15-165 months) for hematologic SMNs (ie, leukemias and lymphomas) and 144 months (range, 33-270
months) for solid tumors. The cumulative incidence rate
(standard error) of SMNs in the osteosarcoma group
was 4.9%  0.9% at 10 years, 6.1%  1.2% at 20 years,
and 6.9%  1.1% at 25 years (Fig. 1). In total, 16 of the
36 patients died of their SMN.
Of the 3 patients who had 2 SMNs each, 1 was a
boy aged 12 years who developed acute myelogenous leukemia 26 months after the diagnosis of osteosarcoma; 10
years later, he developed a metastatic breast cancer. He
was positive for Li-Fraumeni syndrome according to a
DNA test that was obtained after he developed the SMN.
Another of these patients was a woman aged 34 years who
developed colon cancer 36 months after the diagnosis of
osteosarcoma and almost simultaneously developed a
glioblastoma; she died just 5 months later. The third
patient with multiple SMNs was a woman aged 36 years
who developed breast cancer 18 months after she was
diagnosed with osteosarcoma; 2 years later, she developed

was identified in the families of these 3 patients. Genetic
testing was not performed in either of the 2 women to rule
out p53, BRCA1, or BRCA2 mutations. All patients
received treatment in hospitals for their SMN except those
who developed a second sarcoma as an SMN. Breast cancer, as mentioned above, was the most common SMN in
the osteosarcoma group, occurring in 10 females and 1
male. The median age of these 11 patients was 13 years
(range, 11-36 years) at the time of osteosarcoma diagnosis
and 31 years (range, 22-41 years) at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.
Ewing sarcoma cohort

In total, 15 patients with Ewing sarcoma developed
an SMN (Table 4). This group included 8 females and 7
5054

males. Among the SMNs in this group were 6 radiotherapy-induced osteosarcomas, 2 leukemias, 2 parotid cancers, 2 thyroid cancers, 1 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 1
breast cancer, and 1 melanoma (Table 4).
The median interval from the diagnosis of Ewing
sarcoma to the diagnosis of an SMN was 84 months
(range, 12-253 months). The median intervals were 37
months (range, 26-110 months) for hematologic SMNs
and 94 months (range, 12-253 months) for solid tumors.
At study’s end, 10 of these patients remained alive, and 5
patients had died.
Among all 15 patients with Ewing sarcoma, 10
received local radiotherapy at a median dose of 57 grays
(Gy) (range, 42-60 Gy). Among the 6 patients who developed radiotherapy-induced osteosarcoma, 2 received
radiotherapy after surgery at a dose of 45 Gy, and the

conceive naturally, and their sperm test indicated that
they were azospermic. Therefore, they underwent testicular biopsy sperm extraction and in vitro fertilization,
which produced a total of 3 healthy children; neither of
these patients had cryopreserved his sperm before chemotherapy (1 was still prepubertal). The other 17 males fathered a total of 21 children naturally.
Females with osteosarcoma

Males with osteosarcoma

Only 54 of the 342 male patients with osteosarcoma
who remained alive underwent a sperm analysis after
chemotherapy; and the median interval between the diagnosis of osteosarcoma and the sperm analysis was 9.5 years
(range, 4-27 years). At the time they received chemotherapy, 10 of these patients were prepubertal, and 44 were
postpubertal. Of these 54 patients, 36 had azoospermia (5
prepubertal patients and 31 postpubertal patients), 11
had oligospermia (<20 million spermatozoa/mL), and 7
were normospermic. In all, fertility was impaired in 47 of
the tested male patients (87%). Permanent infertility was
most common in patients who had received >40,000 mg/
m2 of ifosfamide.
Two patients (1 enrolled in the ISG/SSG I protocol
and 1 enrolled in the ISG/OS1 protocol) who were azoospermic during the first 5 years after treatment became

Cancer

October 15, 2012

Of the 231 female patients with osteosarcoma who
remained alive, 207 were evaluated for infertility; 53 were
prepubertal and 154 postpubertal. In total, 115 postpubertal females (75%) experienced amenorrhea during
chemotherapy. The median time to resumption of menstruation after chemotherapy was 4 months (range, 1-12
months). Only 6 of the females experienced permanent
amenorrhea, and 4 of these were aged >35 years at the
time of diagnosis. Those prepubertal patients who had
menarche after chemotherapy had no delay in puberty. In
all, fertility was impaired in 6 of the 207 tested females
(2.8%).
Some 28 females delivered a total of 41 healthy children. The median age at first pregnancy was 28 years
(range, 17-36 years). Also, 5 females had a total of 4 voluntary and 2 spontaneous abortions, and there was 1
stillbirth.

median of 11 years (range, 4-25 years) after their diagnosis
of Ewing sarcoma. At the time they received chemotherapy, 5 patients were prepubertal, and 18 were postpubertal. Only 1 of these patients had received HDCT. Testing
revealed that 13 patients were azoospermic, 8 were oligospermic, and 2 were normospermic. In all, fertility was

enced early cardiotoxicity (0-2 months), and the other 11
patients had delayed symptoms onset (range, 3-234
months).
Of the 18 patients who experienced cardiomyopathy, 16 were symptomatic for congestive heart failure.
Half of the 18 patients died—6 of congestive heart failure
and 3 of metastatic cancer. Among the 9 patients who
remained alive, 4 patients underwent heart transplantation and remained alive and free of disease, 3 were receiving medication for dilated cardiomyopathy, and 2
achieved normalization of their LVEF. The median total
dose of doxorubicin in the 18 patients was 480 mg/m2
(range, 300-480 mg/m2).

Females with Ewing sarcoma

Of the 123 female patients with Ewing sarcoma who
remained alive, 99 had their fertility status evaluated after
chemotherapy. Of these 99 patients, 36 were prepubertal,
and 63 were postpubertal; their median age at diagnosis
was 15 years (range, 1-40 years). Fertility evaluation
revealed that 25 females had permanent amenorrhea—15
as a result of HDCT and 6 as a consequence of radiotherapy. Three of the former group had received HDCT as
second-line chemotherapy after they experienced a disease
relapse. Four women had permanent amenorrhea,
although they had not undergone any radiotherapy or
HDCT; the ages of these 4 patients were 28 years, 30
years, 35 years, and 40 years. In all, early iatrogenic menopause occurred in 29 of the 99 tested patients (29.2%).
The other patients had menstruation, but this does not
exclude infertility (capability to conceive), because only
pregnancy is proof of fertility.
Older age at the time of diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma
was a predisposing factor for sterility in these patients, just
as it was for the females with osteosarcoma. In all, 19 of
these females became pregnant and delivered a total of 31
healthy children; only 1 premature delivery was reported.
The median age at the time of the first pregnancy was 26
years (range, 20-34 years). There were 3 voluntary abortions. In all 4 subgroups, no increase in congenital malformations was observed in the offspring of any patient who
had conceived after therapy.
Cardiotoxicity
Osteosarcoma cohort

Of the 883 patients with osteosarcoma, 18 (2%)
experienced cardiomyopathy. Of these 18 patients, there
were 11 females and 7 males, and their median age was 12
years. Cardiomyopathy was evidenced by a reduction in
LVEF to <45%. The median interval from the cessation
of chemotherapy to the onset of cardiomyopathy was 2
months (range, 0-234 months). Seven patients experi5056

Ewing sarcoma cohort

Cardiotoxicity was observed in 7 of the 543 patients
with Ewing sarcoma (1.3%), including 4 males and 3
females (median age, 8 years). The median interval from
the cessation of chemotherapy to the onset of cardiomyopathy was 3 months (range, 0-138 months). Early cardiotoxicity was observed in 3 patients at 0 months, 2
months, and 2 months; the others had delayed cardiotoxicity (range, 3-138 months).
At study’s end, all 7 patients remained alive. Four of
these patients were receiving medical treatment for dilated
cardiomyopathy, 2 underwent heart transplantation, and
2 achieved normalization of their LVEF after 6 months
and 12 months. The median total dose of doxorubicin
received by the 7 patients was 400 mg/m2 (range, 400420 mg/m2). A summary of the study findings is provided
as a flow chart in Figure 3.
DISCUSSION
Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, along with Hodgkin
lymphoma and central nervous system tumors, are associated with the greatest risks for adverse chronic health conditions in long-term survivors. These adverse conditions
include SMNs, sterility, and cardiac impairment.16
Second Malignant Neoplasms

Our findings with regard to SMNs are in accordance with
those of previous studies, in which the cumulative incidence of SMNs 20 years after a diagnosis of bone sarcoma
ranged from 1.6% to 5.4%.17,18 Compared with other
analyses of patients with Ewing sarcoma who received
both adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy on earlier
protocols (1972-1999),2 our study indicated a lower rate
of radiotherapy-induced osteosarcoma; this lower rate
probably was attributable to the smaller doses of radiotherapy that were used in the more recent protocols. Likewise, the low cumulative incidence of SMNs and

cardiotoxicity in our Ewing sarcoma patients can be
attributed in part to the smaller doses of doxorubicin used
in the more recent protocols. Another reason for the low
incidence may be the relatively high proportion of
patients with Ewing sarcoma who were lost to followup—38 of 581 patients (6.5%) with Ewing sarcoma compared with 15 of 898 patients (1.7%) with osteosarcoma.
Finally, the median duration of follow-up was much
shorter in the Ewing sarcoma cohort than in the osteosarcoma cohort (86 months and 126 months, respectively).
Cancer

It is interesting to note that, 10 to 20 years after the
diagnosis of a primary bone sarcoma, our patients were
more likely to develop an SMN than a recurrent bone cancer. This finding is consistent with other reports.19 In our
study, breast cancer was the most common SMN among
the osteosarcoma survivors, but only 1 breast cancer was
diagnosed in our Ewing sarcoma survivors. Breast cancer
also was the most common SMN in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.20 For our study, we were not able to
analyze standardized incidence ratios or the absolute
5057

excess risk of SMN among the general pediatric population, because there is no national pediatric tumor registry
in Italy, although there is a network (the Italian Association of Cancer Registries [AIRTum]) of several regional
tumor registries that cover approximately 33% of the pediatric population. Only estimated data are available from
the projection of data from 1 region (Piedmont) over the
entire country.21
The median age at osteosarcoma diagnosis in those
patients who developed breast cancer was younger than
that of the osteosarcoma group as a whole (13 years and
15 years, respectively). Neglia et al17 analyzed 13,581
long-term pediatric cancer survivors and observed that, in
females, a younger age at diagnosis (range, 5-9 years) was
a risk factor for breast cancer. This finding may be related
to the exposure of growing breast tissue to carcinogens.
Other studies have reported a high incidence of breast
cancer as an SMN after chest radiotherapy in patients
with Hodgkin lymphoma and after total lung irradiation
in patients with Ewing sarcoma.16,17 A greater risk of
breast cancer as an SMN also was reported in females who
did not receive any chest radiotherapy. A possible genetic
predisposition has been proposed by Oeffinger and Bhatia22 and by Ginsberg et al23; the latter group reported a
9% cumulative incidence of SMN at 25 years in patients
with Ewing cancer, which was almost twice as high as our
finding. However, their study was conducted from 1970
through 1986, whereas our study was conducted from
1983 through 2006. The use and dose of radiotherapy for
local treatment have decreased over the years. In the study
by Ginsberg et al, radiotherapy was received by 80% of
patients compared with approximately 50% of patients in
our study.
In our study, more SMNs occurred in females than
in males (28 SMNs vs 23 SMNs, respectively). If we consider patients with multiple SMNs, the ratio is 30:24.
Because our study included more males than females, the
disparity according to sex was greater than what it appears
to be based simply on the number of SMNs in each group.
Other investigators have reported that female sex is an
unfavorable prognostic factor for an SMN17 as well as for
cardiotoxicity.24
Infertility

We were able to evaluate male infertility with a sperm test
in only 16% of our patients with osteosarcoma and in
11% of our patients with Ewing sarcoma. There appeared
to be some reluctance among males to undergo a sperm
test, and it was much easier to evaluate the females on the
basis of their menstrual status. Our own group reported
5058

previously that sterility in patients with osteosarcoma
affects males more than females and that the risk of sterility is directly proportional to the total dose of the alkylating agent.25 The risk of sterility also is greater for
patients of both sexes who receive HDCT followed by peripheral blood stem cell rescue. We also reported previously that the most important predictive factor for
sterility in females is age.26 In patients with Ewing sarcoma, the major cause of infertility in both males and
females is HDCT and subsequent autologous stem cell
transplantation. Nonetheless, the small number of
patients evaluable for fertility in our study certainly is a
bias and makes it difficult to draw conclusions At our
institute, we have offered women the option of cryopreservation of their ovarian tissue since 2006; for men,
sperm banking is a common practice. Obviously, sperm
banking is not an option for prepubertal males, and longterm infertility is certainly a possibility. However, these
patients still may benefit from testicular biopsy sperm
extraction, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and in vitro
fertilization.27,28 Thanks to progress in fertility preservation techniques, 3 patients in our study were able to father
children by in vitro fertilization.
Cardiotoxicity

In our study, cardiotoxicity was more common in the osteosarcoma cohort (2%) than in the Ewing sarcoma
cohort (1.3%); the latter group received lower doses of
doxorubicin, and all of these doses were infused over 24
hours rather than over 8 hours (the shorter infusion was
received by patients with osteosarcoma in the earlier protocols). In fact, the greatest incidence of cardiomyopathy
(7 of 18 patients) occurred on the earlier IOR-2 protocol,
in which patients received the highest dose of doxorubicin
(480 mg/m2) over the short 8-hour time frame. Prolonged
infusion has been identified as a protective factor against
anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin) cardiotoxicity.29
Patients in our investigation who developed cardiotoxicity generally were younger; also, there was a slight
preponderance of females among the patients with osteosarcoma, but not among the patients with Ewing sarcoma.
Younger age as a risk factor for cardiotoxicity was
observed by Pratt et al.30 Those authors also observed that
anthracycline cardiotoxicity was more relevant in children
aged <4 years, because it impairs the growth of
myocardiocytes.
Several hypotheses to explain the female predilection
for cardiotoxicity have been proposed. Lipshultz et al
based their theory on the finding that females have more
body fat than males and that anthracyclines are poorly

absorbed in fat tissue; thus, they reasoned that the cellular
concentration of anthracyclines would be increased in
nonadipose tissue, such as heart muscle, in patients who
receive doses calculated on the basis of body surface
area.24 Another explanation was offered by Krischer et al,
who cited sex-related difference in anthracycline pharmacokinetics; compared with males, females have a lower
clearance and a lower area under the curve ratio.31
In conclusion, all efforts should be made to monitor
patients who have survived bone sarcoma with prolonged follow-up and to inform patients of possible late complication
of their previous medical treatment. Efforts also are needed to
balance treatments while reducing late side effects.
