ABSTRACT
Anti-EGFR therapy and antiangiogenic therapies are used alone or in combination
with chemotherapies to improve survival in metastatic colorectal cancer. However, it
is unknown whether pretreatment with antiangiogenic therapy could impact on the
efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy.
We selected one hundred and twenty eight patients diagnosed with advanced
colorectal cancer with a KRAS and NRAS unmutated tumor. These patients were
treated with cetuximab or panitumumab alone or with chemotherapy as second or
third-line. Univariate and multivariate Cox model analysis were performed to estimate
the effect of a previous bevacizumab regimen on progression free survival and on
overall survival during anti-EGFR therapy. In vitro studies using wild type KRAS
and NRAS colon cancer cells were performed to evaluate the impact of VEGF-A on
cetuximab-induced cell death.
The median progression free survival (PFS) during anti-EGFR treatment was
significantly different between the bevacizumab group and the non-bevacizumab
group (2.8 and 4 months respectively; p = 0.003). The median overall survival from
the beginning of the metastatic disease was similar in the two groups (41.3 and
42 months respectively; p = 0.7). In vitro, VEGF-A induced a resistance toward
cetuximab cytotoxicity on three KRAS and NRAS wild type colon cancer cell lines in
a VEGFR2 and Stat-3-dependent manner.
All in all, our clinical data, supported by in vitro procedures, suggest that a
previous anti-VEGF therapy decreases anti-EGFR efficacy. Although these results
are observed in a limited cohort, they could be taken into consideration for a better
strategy of care for patient suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer.

INTRODUCTION

response rates, progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) [2–4]. In a recent phase III clinical
trial of palliative chemotherapy, the overall survival of
patients has reached 24 to 30 months [5, 6]. Colorectal
cancer treatment is currently based on the use of three
cytotoxic chemotherapy, fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin
and irinotecan associated with targeted therapies (antiEpithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) (panitumumab
and cetuximab) or anti-Vascular Endothelium Growth
Factor (VEGF) (bevacizumab or aflibercept) monoclonal
antibodies). However, the treatment of incurable mCRC

Colorectal cancer is the second cause of cancer
death worldwide [1]. Approximately 30% of patients
with colorectal cancer have an overt metastatic disease
at diagnosis. When all metastatic sites could not be
surgically removed, treatment remains palliative and
requires different chemotherapeutic protocols. For
patients with non-operable metastatic colorectal cancer
(mCRC), there is no curative option. However, the use of
palliative systemic chemotherapy dramatically enhances

remains currently a challenging question. The use of
antiangiogenic agents as first and second-line was shown
to improve overall survival [7, 8]. Recently, clinical trials
underlined that permanent antiangiogenic blocking as first
and second-line improved overall survival [9]. The use of
anti-EGFR therapy could also improve survival as first or
third-line treatment [10–12]. In addition, the use of antiEGFR therapy was rationalized using genomic testing of
Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS) and Neuroblastoma RAS
(NRAS) mutation status. Indeed, these assays provide
a better selection of patients carrying wild-type tumor
assuring optimal response to anti-EGFR therapy and
avoiding an inappropriate use of this targeted therapy when
KRAS and/or RAS were mutated [13]. In addition, recent
advances in management of classical cytotoxic agents
underline the possibility to administrate the three cytotoxic
drugs as first-line of colorectal cancer treatment [14, 15].
While all these treatments improve overall survival,
the optimal sequence of therapy still needs to be determined.
Anti-EGFR therapy was first designed for patients who
developed resistance to chemotherapy, explaining why it
is frequently used as second or third-line. In such case it
is not known if a previous antiangiogenic administration
could modify the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy. To address
this question, we used our patients’ database treated for a
metastatic colorectal cancer, with a restriction to population
with current approval for anti-EGFR therapy, i.e. KRAS and
NRAS wild type population.

to patients receiving chemotherapy alone (log-rank test
P < 0.003) (Figure 1). Median PFS was 2.8 months (95%
CI, 2–3 months) in bevacizumab group and 4 months
(95% CI, 3.3–5 months) in non-bevacizumab group.
Univariate analysis indicated that WHO performance
status ≥ 2, primary tumor in place, leucocytes > 10,000/ml
and previous treatment with bevacizumab are significantly
associated with a poorer PFS (Table 2). Using multivariate
analysis, only previous treatment with bevacizumab
remained independently associated with a poorer PFS
(HR = 1.7 [1.06–2.3] P = 0.03) (Table 2).

Overall survival on anti-EGFR therapy in
bevacizumab group and chemotherapy alone
group as first-line therapy
Proportions of patients who died were not
significantly different between the two groups, 73% in
chemotherapy alone group, and 71% in bevacizumab
group (P = 0.6). We did not detect any difference in
outcome in term of OS in patients receiving bevacizumab
or chemotherapy alone as first-line (log-rank test
P < 0.7) (Figure 2). Median OS was 41.3 months
(95% CI, 30.7–62.9 months) in bevacizumab
group and 42 months (95% CI, 23.5–56 months) in
non-bevacizumab group (p = 0.7). Univariate analysis
indicated that high CarcinoEmbryonic Antigen (CEA)
level, WHO performance status ≥ 2, synchronous
metastatic disease, absence of complete metastases
surgery, absence or resection of primary tumor in colon,
number of metastatic site > 1, leucocytes > 10,000/ml
and Alkaline Phosphatase > 300 UI/ml are significantly
associated with a poorer OS. Using multivariate analysis,
only performance status, previous surgery of primary
tumor and phosphatase alkaline serum level remained
independently associated with a poorer OS (Table 3).

RESULTS
Patients’ characteristics
We selected 198 patients who received cetuximab or
panitumumab as second or third-line therapy for mCRC
from our cohort treated at Georges Francois Leclerc Cancer
Center. We completed KRAS and NRAS genotyping for all
patients and retained 128 patients with wild type status
for KRAS and NRAS genes. Of these patients, 76 (59%)
received bevacizumab based chemotherapy during the
first- line therapy for metastatic disease. Patients and tumors
characteristics are shown in Table 1. We did not observe
significant difference between the two groups of patients
who received bevacizumab or not in first-line for the main
clinical and biological characteristics, except for age which
was significantly younger in the non-bevacizumab group
(59 vs 66 years, P = 0.02). Median follow-up at the data
cut-off point was 24 months in bevacizumab group and
28 months in chemotherapy group.

In vitro effect of VEGF-A on the antitumor effect
of anti-EGFR
While pretreatment with bevacizumab limits the
clinical efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy, we raise the
hypothesis that bevacizumab could modify tumor biology
and confer resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. Gordon et al.
reported that an intravenous injection of bevacizumab led
to an increase in serum total VEGF-A in clinical trials,
while free VEGF-A concentration was reduced [16]. Since
then, other groups have reported counterintuitive increases
in the plasma VEGF-A level following bevacizumab
administration [17–19]. We also found an increase in
VEGF-A serum level in 25 patients obtained from an
independent cohort, treated with bevacizumab combined to
bi-chemotherapy (FOLinic acid Fluorouracil OXaliplatin
or FOLFOX) as a first-line for metastatic colorectal cancer
fifteen days after bevacizumab injection. No significant
change in VEGF-A serum level was observed in

12 patients suffering from digestive cancer and not treated
with bevacizumab as control (Figure 3). To assay the effect
of VEGF-A on anti-EGFR therapy in vitro, we selected
three colorectal cancer cell lines (Colo320, SW48, and
Caco2) with a KRAS, NRAS, HRAS and BRAF wild-type
status. We first checked VEGFRs and EGFR expression by
western blotting in those different cell lines (Figure 4A).
Cetuximab was able to decrease cell proliferation and cell
death in vitro (Figure 4B and 4C) by inhibiting EGFR
phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 1). Treatment of
tumor cells with recombinant VEGF-A prior anti-EGFR
therapy conferred resistance to cetuximab (Figure 4B
and 4C). Previous reports showed that VEGF-A exposure
induces VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and subsequent
Stat-3 activation leading to resistance to apoptosis
[20, 21]. Western blot analysis of SW48 and Colo320 cell
line showed that VEGFR-2 and Stat-3 are phosphorylated
upon VEGF-A treatment (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3).
As a result, survival signals such as phosphorylated Erk1/2
are upregulated in SW48 model. Only association of
cetuximab and inhibitors such as axitinib for VEGFR-2
and STA-21 for Stat-3 abrogated this pathway (Figure 5A).
Although a weak and non-significant axitinib toxicity was
observed on Colo320 and SW48 cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 4), we clearly demonstrated that VEGFR-2 or
Stat-3 inhibition using respectively axitinib or STA-21
resulted in restoration of SW48, Caco-2 and Colo320
sensitivity toward anti-EGFR therapy, when cells were
stimulated with VEGF-A (Figure 5B).

All in all, these data underline that VEGF-A
exposure confers resistance to cetuximab therapy via
VEGFR-2 and Stat-3 activation.

DISCUSSION
Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated
with anti-EGFR with or without chemotherapy usually
develop resistance within 6 to 12 months after the
beginning of the therapy. However, very few studies
evaluate the importance of a previous treatment on the
efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy. In our retrospective
database, we observed that a previous anti-VEGF therapy
decreases anti-EGFR efficacy in metastatic colorectal
cancer with a wild type status for KRAS and NRAS genes.
Patients treated with bevacizumab before anti-EGFR
therapy had a poorer PFS on anti-EGFR therapy compared
to patients without a previous anti-VEGF therapy.
However, no difference was observed on OS.
VEGFR and EGFR are membrane receptors
involved in two independent signaling pathways with
specific ligands and specific downstream pathways but
are however closely interconnected. Recent reports [22]
underline that activation of EGFR pathway can promote
neoangiogenesis by up-regulating VEGF-A production
or other key proangiogenic mediators. EGF and TGF-α,
two ligands of EGFR can induce VEGF-A expression
via activation of EGFR in cell culture models and as a
consequence could have proangiogenic properties [23].

and metastases. Data from in vitro and in vivo studies
reviewed by Ellis et al., suggest that at least a part of the
antitumor effect of cetuximab is mediated by inhibition
of angiogenesis via a downregulation of proangiogenic
molecules [25]. Similar results have also been reported for
small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR,

In preclinical models, EGFR blockade using monoclonal
antibody cetuximab, resulted in a down-regulation
of proangiogenic mediators, including VEGF-A,
interleukine-8 (IL-8), and basic Fibrinogen Growth Factor
(FGF) [24]. Such reduction of proangiogenic factors is
associated with a reduction in the number of microvessels

such as gefitinib [25]. However, EGFR inhibition does not
completely block VEGF-A production, suggesting that
anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF therapies may be synergistic.
On the other hand, angiogenesis may contribute
to resistance to anti-EGFR. Preclinical data suggest that
an increase in VEGF-A expression and other angiogenic
factors can play a role in resistance of anti EGFRtherapy. Viloria-Petit et al. showed that variants of
A431 lung cancer cells resistant to anti-EGFR, present
a higher expression of VEGF-A [26]. This group also
showed a direct correlation between the level of VEGF-A
and resistance towards anti-EGFR therapy. This is in
accordance with our in vitro results. Here we show that
VEGF-A directly confers resistance to cetuximab via Stat-3
and VEGFR2 activation. Blocking these pathways using
VEGFR2 inhibitor axitinib or Stat-3 blocker STA-21,
restore tumor cell sensitivity to cetuximab therapy. Such
data raise the hypothesis that high level of VEGF-A
restrains sensitivity to anti-EGFR and clearly demonstrates
the logic to combine VEGFR and EGFR inhibition to
provide complementary anti-tumor effects.
A pharmacokinetic model suggests that the
intravenous injection of bevacizumab leads to an increase
in VEGF-A serum concentration in patients suffering
from cancer [27]. This higher VEGF-A serum level
is a consequence of inter-compartmental exchange of
VEGF-A, due to the formation with the anti-VEGF agent
of a VEGF/anti-VEGF complex. These results suggest
that a fraction of the anti-VEGF drug moves from blood
vessel, allowing the agent to bind the interstitial VEGF-A.
When the complex of VEGF/anti-VEGF moves to blood

and lymphatic vessels and dissociates, VEGF-A is released
and its concentration increases in the plasma. This model
shows that rather than depleting VEGF-A in bloodstream,
bevacizumab may act by depleting VEGF-A from the
tumor interstitium, to release it in the blood [27]. We
also confirm in a small cohort of 26 metastatic colorectal
cancer patients treated as first-line with bevacizumab
combined to chemotherapy, that VEGF-A serum level
rapidly increased after bevacizumab injection. Such model
raises the hypothesis that bevacizumab therapy could
favor anti-EGFR resistance via an increase in the level of
serum VEGF-A.
The dual blockade was previously tested in clinical
trials. In metastatic colorectal cancer a randomized phase II
trial BOND2 examined the efficacy and safety of
concurrent administration of bevacizumab plus cetuximab
with and without irinotecan, in irinotecan-refractory
disease. In this trial, in a population of patients without
RAS selection, Saltz et al. showed that the addition of
bevacizumab to the cetuximab treatment produced a
37% response rate with a median time to progression of
7,9 months [28]. These results are more relevant compared
to the results of previously tested association of cetuximab
plus irinotecan which give 22% of response rate and
4.5 months of progression free survival [10]. However,
two recent phase III trials have shown no benefit for the
double biologic combination targeting EGFR and VEGF
when used with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for
mCRC. In the CAIRO-2 (Capecitabine, Irinotecan, and
Oxaliplatin in Advanced Colorectal Cancer) study, 755
front-line mCRC patients were randomized to receive

mutated KRAS who received cetuximab, exhibited a
poorer PFS compared to the non-cetuximab arm [29]. For
the PACCE trial, a retrospective evaluation demonstrated
adverse outcomes for the panitumumab arm in tumors
with both wild-type and mutant KRAS [30]. The results
of these phase III trials suggest that the addition of antiEGFR antibodies is not likely to enhance the effectiveness
of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy when used as
first-line therapy for patients with mCRC irrespective of
KRAS mutation status.
This can be explained by the observation that
bevacizumab may affect cetuximab distribution in

a preclinical model and may limit its efficacy as a
consequence [31]. Another explanation comes from
a pharmacokinetic model which suggests that the
intravenous injection of bevacizumab leads to an increase
in VEGF-A serum concentration in patients suffering
from cancer [27]. This increase in VEGF-A serum level
is a consequence of inter-compartmental exchange of
VEGF-A, due to the formation with the anti-VEGF agent
of a VEGF/anti-VEGF complex. These results suggest
that a fraction of the anti-VEGF drug moves from blood

and lymphatic vessels and dissociates, VEGF-A is released
and its concentration increases in the plasma. This model
shows that rather than depleting VEGF-A in the blood,
bevacizumab may act by depleting VEGF-A from the
tumor interstitium, to release it in the blood [27]. We also
confirm in a small cohort of metastatic colorectal cancer
patients treated as first-line with bevacizumab combined to
chemotherapy, that VEGF-A serum level rapidly increased
after bevacizumab injection. Such model raises the
hypothesis that bevacizumab therapy could favor anti-EGFR
resistance via an increase in the level of serum VEGF-A.
To conclude, our clinical data stress that
bevacizumab administration as a first-line may negatively
impact on further anti-EGFR efficacy. These results give a
biological rational to clinically use anti-EGFR as a first-line
of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer treatment.
An alternative bi-chemotherapy without additional
bevacizumab treatment may also be planned as first-line.
However, benefits observed in PFS are not translated in OS
in our study. These results have to be interpreted carefully
by taking into account the low number of patients and the
retrospective design of this study.
Our in vitro models biologically support our clinical
data and propose that an increase in VEGF-A serum
level after a previous treatment by bevacizumab may be
responsible for resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. This
may explain previous clinical data showing failure of
cetuximab and bevacizumab combination. These results
underline the hypothesis that anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF
combination therapy could be evaluated using new antiVEGFR strategy such as axitinib. One can speculate
that the use of downstream blockers of VEGFR could be
relevant whatever the circulating VEGF-A level.
Another possibility of combined therapy would be
to test whether VEGF-A trapping using aflibercept may
be efficient in association with anti-EGFR. Aflibercept
should limit VEGF-A bloodstream redistribution
compared to bevacizumab as the dissociation constant
for VEGF-A of aflibercept is up to 500 times lower
compared to bevacizumab [32]. We suggest that the
complex aflibercept/VEGF-A could be stronger and
that VEGF-A serum level will not be increased. These
speculations have to be evaluated in clinical trial to
be validated.

molecular biology testing if not performed previously
and tested tissue samples for KRAS (exons 2, 3 and 4),
NRAS (exons 2, 3 and 4). We only included 128 patients
treated with anti-EGFR therapy with a KRAS and NRAS
wild type status. The following data were collected and
analyzed: age, performance status (according to WHO
criteria) at the time of the first cycle, gender, primary
tumor site (colon or rectum), localization of metastatic
sites, previous anticancer drugs received, CEA and
Lactate Deshydrogenase (LDH), Alkaline Phosphatase
level and leukocytes count at the time of the first
cycle, the type of chemotherapy used with anti-EGFR
chemotherapies. Progression-free survival on anti-EGFR
therapies and overall survival were also recorded. This
study was approved by the local scientific and ethics
committee.

KRAS, NRAS mutation analysis
DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded
colorectal cancer samples after histological control
(Hematoxylin-Eosin-Saffron) for at least 50% tumor cells.
KRAS exons 2 (codons 12 and 13), 3 (codons 59 and 61)
and 4 (codons 117 and 146) and NRAS exons 2 (codons
12 and 13), 3 (codons 59 and 61), and 4 (codons 117
and 146) were investigated using direct sequencing by
Sanger methods or allelic discrimination.

Clinical data statistical analysis
All patients were followed up until death or the
end of data recording (December 31st 2013). Progression
free survival on anti-EGFR therapy was calculated from
the date when the therapy started to the date of disease
progression, and overall survival was calculated from
the date of the beginning of treatment for the metastatic
disease to the date of death. Median follow-up with its 95%
confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the reverse
Kaplan-Meier method. Patient or disease characteristics
were examined using the Chi2 test or Fisher’s exact test for
qualitative variables, and the Student t or Mann-Whitney
tests for continuous variables, as appropriate to compare
the group of patient treated with bevacizumab in first line
or not. Survival probabilities were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves were compared
using the log-rank test. A multivariate Cox model was used
to estimate the effects of a previous bevacizumab regimen
on progression free survival and on overall survival after
adjusting with clinical parameters selected in univariate
analysis. In the multivariate model only variable with
p < 0.1 in the univariate model were retained. The level of
significance to retain a variable was set at p < 0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc
Software. All tests were two sided, and P values < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and methods
We used our database of 399 patients treated for a
metastatic colorectal cancer at Georges Francois Leclerc
Cancer Center from January 2001 to December 2013.
In this database we selected all patients (198) treated as
second or third-line by cetuximab or panitumumab alone
or in association with chemotherapy. We completed

were harvested and stained using AnnexinV FITC and
7AAD kit (BDPharmingen, Le pont de Claix, France)
with manufacturer’s protocol. Signal was measured with
LSRII Cytometer (BDPharmingen) and analyzed with
FlowJo software (Flowjo LLC, Ashland, OR, USA).
Data displayed are means and SD from 3 independent
experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism software.

VEGF-A assay
Twenty six patients from another cohort (Bevacapi
study NCT01810777) were selected. Patients were all
suffering from mCRC and treated with bichemotherapy
FOLFOX combined to bevacizumab as first-line. Another
12 patients suffering from digestive cancer and not treated
with anti-VEGF therapy were also selected. For both
groups, blood was sampled before and 15 days after first
chemotherapy administration. After sera preparation,
VEGF-A was quantified and analyzed by ELISA
(eBiosciences, Rennes, France) using manufacturer’s
protocol. Samples were analyzed in triplicate.

Western blot analysis
Cells were seeded in a 6 well plate in appropriate
medium containing 10% FBS. After cells reached
80% confluence, recombinant VEGF-A wad added
to medium. Whole-cell lysates were prepared as
described previously, [32] by lysing the cells in boiling
buffer (1% SDS, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM Tris
(pH 7.4)) in the presence of complete protease inhibitor
mixture. The viscosity of the samples was reduced by
sonication. Whole-cell lysate samples were separated by
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electroblotted
to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare,
Villacoublay, France). After incubation for 1 h at RT by 5%
nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline–0.1% Tween-20,
membranes were incubated overnight with indicated
primary antibody diluted in Tris-buffered saline-BSA5%–
Tween-20, washed, incubated with the secondary antibody
for 30 min at RT, and washed again before analysis with a
chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham, Villacoublay,
France) and chemidoc acquisition system (Biorad, Marne
la Coquette, France). The following Abs were used: Stat-3
(#4904), p-Stat-3 (Y705) (#9145), VEGFR1 (#2893),
VEGFR2 (#2479), p-VEGFR2 (#4991), Stat-5 (#9363),
p-Stat-5 (#4322), Erk1/2 (#9102) and p-Erk1/2 (#9101)
(all from Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France);
EGFR (ab52894), p-EGFR (ab40815) and α-tubulin
(ab15246) (all from Abcam, Paris, France); p-VEGFR2
(#07–722) (from Merck Millipore, Fontenay sous-Bois,
France); HSC-70 (sc7298) (from Santa Cruz, Heidelberg,
Germany). Secondary Abs HRP-conjugated polyclonal
goat anti-mouse and swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, Interchim) were also used.
Images displayed are representative data out from three
independent experiments. Quantifications were obtained
using quantity tools thumbs provided Image Lab Software
(Biorad, Marne la Coquette, France).

Cell culture
SW48, Caco-2 and Colo320 human colon cancer
cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown in DMEM 4, 5 g/L
glucose (Lonza, Levallois, France) supplemented with
10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza) in an
atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Crystal violet staining
Colon cancer cell lines were obtained from
American Tissue Culture & Collection and selected for
in vitro assay due to their KRAS, NRAS wild type status.
Cells (2,000 cells/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate in
appropriate medium. Twenty-four hours later, cells were
treated with 500 µg/mL cetuximab (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany), and incubated for another 7 days. After
treatment, cells were washed two times with Phosphate
Buffered Saline (PBS) and fixed with 100% ethanol for
30 minutes before crystal violet staining. Crystal violet
was then suspended in 33% acetic acid and OD was read
at 590 nm with a Wallac 2 spectophotometer (PerkinElmer, Villebon sur Yvette, France). In some cases
cells were treated with human recombinant VEGF-A
(Peprotech, Neuilly sur Seine, France) at 0,5 or 5 ng/mL
the day before cetuximab treatment. In other cases STA-21
10 µM (Bertin Pharma, Montigny le Bretonneux, France)
and axitinib 500 pM (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were
used concomitantly with VEGF-A stimulation. The
following day, cetuximab was added for seven days in
media containing or not inhibitors. Data displayed are
means and SD from 3 independent experiments. Ratio of
detached cells were calculated using the following formula
R = 1-(ODx/ODco). Statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism software.
