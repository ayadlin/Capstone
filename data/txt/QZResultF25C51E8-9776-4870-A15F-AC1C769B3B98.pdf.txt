Sensitivity to Cisplatin and PARP Inhibition

Abstract
Cell survival after DNA damage relies on DNA repair, the abrogation of which causes genomic instability. The
DNA repair protein RAD51 and the trans-lesion synthesis DNA polymerase REV1 are required for resistance to
DNA interstrand cross-linking agents such as cisplatin. In this study, we show that overexpression of miR-96 in
human cancer cells reduces the levels of RAD51 and REV1 and impacts the cellular response to agents that cause
DNA damage. MiR-96 directly targeted the coding region of RAD51 and the 30 -untranslated region of REV1.
Overexpression of miR-96 decreased the efﬁciency of homologous recombination and enhanced sensitivity
to the PARP inhibitor AZD2281 in vitro and to cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our ﬁndings
indicate that miR-96 regulates DNA repair and chemosensitivity by repressing RAD51 and REV1. As a therapeutic
candidate, miR-96 may improve chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy by increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA
damage. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4037–46. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
To preserve genomic stability, cells have developed an
elaborate DNA damage response and repair network to ﬁx
DNA lesions that continuously arise due to exposure to endogenous or exogenous genotoxins (1). DNA repair plays a critical
role in preventing the development of cancer, whereas defective DNA repair in cancer cells can be exploited for cancer
therapy using DNA-damaging agents.
Interstrand DNA crosslink (ICL)-inducing agents, such as
cisplatin, carboplatin, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and
mitomycin C are widely used for the treatment of cancer.
Repair of ICLs requires the coordination of multiple DNA
repair pathways including the Fanconi anemia pathway (2),
translesion synthesis (TLS), homologous recombination (HR),
and endonuclease-mediated DNA processing (3).
HR is the critical pathway for the repair of DNA doublestrand breaks (DSBs) in S- and G2 phases of the cell cycle (4),
and requires numerous factors including the recombinase
RAD51 and the breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene
products, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Tumors defective in HR, such
as breast/ovarian cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deﬁciency,
are responsive to treatment with ICL-inducing agents as well as
PARP inhibitors (5). TLS, carried out by a multitude of mutaAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase,

genic DNA polymerases such as REV1 (6), protects the genome
from large deletions by replicating across ICLs and other
occluding lesions (3). Thus, targeting these DNA repair pathways involved in ICL repair is a logical strategy for overcoming
cellular resistance to ICL-inducing agents (5, 7, 8). In addition,
REV1-mediated TLS is an error prone process, which contributes to the mutagenic effects of many antitumor DNA-damaging agents and may play a critical role in the development of
acquired chemoresistance (9). Therefore, inhibiting REV1mediated TLS may prevent the emergence of chemoresistance.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that act as
important regulators of gene expression. Aberrant expression of
miRNAs is often seen in cancer (10). These cancer-related
miRNAs can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes and
modulate many aspects of carcinogenesis, such as cell proliferation, cell-cycle control, apoptosis, metastasis, and angiogenesis
(11). Some of these miRNAs can play important roles in the
regulation of DNA repair and cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics. For example, miR-210 and miR-373
target RAD52 and RAD23B, respectively, and may regulate nucleotide excision repair and HR in hypoxia (12). MiR-24 and miR-138
downregulate histone H2AX (13, 14), and miR-421 targets ATM
kinase (15) to modulate cellular response to multiple DNAdamaging agents. Thus, these miRNAs may potentially be used
as putative therapeutic agents that beneﬁt cancer treatment.
The miR-183-96-182 polycistronic miRNA cluster is located
at chromosome 7q32.2. Expression of miRNAs in this cluster is
often increased in many common cancers, such as colon (16),
lung (17), melanoma (18), breast (19), ovarian (20, 21), glioblastoma (22), prostate (23), liver (24), endometrial (25), bladder (26, 27), and germ cell (28) cancers, and may serve as
potential tumor markers in multiple cancers (22, 23, 27). They
are involved in the regulation of a wide range of cellular
processes including cell proliferation (18, 19, 25, 29), senescence (30), cell migration (31, 32), and metastasis (18).

By conducting a cell-based miRNA library screen that
uses ionizing radiation (IR)-induced RAD51 foci formation
as a readout in U2OS cells (Huang and colleagues, manuscript
in preparation), we have recently identiﬁed several miRNAs,
including miR-96, as putative negative regulators of RAD51mediated HR repair. Here, we show the functional roles of miR96 in the regulation of DNA repair and chemosensitivity.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
U2OS, HeLa, HCC1937, and MDA-MB-231 were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection. HCT116 was
obtained from Clurman Lab [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center (FHCRC), Seattle, WA]. BRCA2-deiﬁcient ovarian cancer
cell line PEO1 and its BRCA2-proﬁcient revertant PEO1 C4-2
were previously described (33). These cell lines have been tested
and authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA proﬁling
(Bio-Synthesis, Inc.) in May, 2012. HCC1937 cells were cultured
in RPMI supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. All other cell
lines were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Cells were all maintained in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2-containing atmosphere at 37 C.
Plasmids, siRNAs, miRNA mimics, miRNA inhibitors, and
lentivirus production
30 -UTR (untranslated region) of human RAD51 (position
1–980 bp) and human REV1 (position 14–783 bp) was ampliﬁed
by PCR and cloned into pGL3-control (Promega) to obtain
pGL3-RAD51 30 UTR and pGL3-REV1 30 UTR plasmids. RAD51
MRE2 of miR-96 (position 1259–1346 bp of RAD51 mRNA)
was ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into pGl3-control vector.
Putative-binding sites of miR-96 in RAD51 MRE2 and REV1
30 -UTR were mutated using the QuikChange Site-Direct Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were delivered into cells using
TransIT-LT-1 reagent (Mirus). The coding sequence of RAD51
was PCR amplifed and cloned into pMMPpuro retroviral vector
with a N-termimus DsRed signal to obtain pMMP-DsRed-RAD51
plasmid. The pLLEV-EGFP-REV1 lentiviral plasmid was kindly
provided by Dr. Canman (University of Michigan Medical
School, Ann Arbor, MI; ref. 7). MiR-96 and the spanning
sequences (150 bp on each end) were ampliﬁed by PCR and
inserted into pLemiR lentivrial vector (Open Biosystems) for
generating miR-96 precursor. The plko1-shREV1 (50 - CCGGGCTGTTCGTATGGAAATCAAACTCGAGTTTGATTTCCATACGAACAGCTTTTTTG-30 ) and shBRCA1 (50 -CCGGTATAAGACCTCTGGCATGAATCTCGAGATTCATGCCAGAGGTCTTATATTTTTG-30 ) lentiviral vectors were purchased from Sigma. Retrovirus and lentivirus were produced as described (14).
Speciﬁc siRNAs were used to knock down REV1 (50 ATCGGTGGAATCGGTTTGGAA-30 ; ref. 7) and BRCA2 (50 AACAACAATTACGAACCAAAC-30 ; ref. 34; Qiagen). Transfection of siRNAs, miRNA mimics (Dharmacon) was done at
10 nmol/L using HiPerFect reagent (Qiagen). Transfection of
miR-96 power inhibitor (Exiqon) was done at 25 nmol/L using
Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen). MiRNA mimic negative

inhibitor B (miR-neg inhibitor, Exiqon), or luciferase siRNA
(siLuc, 50 -AACGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-30 ; Qiagen) served
as negative controls.
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
Cells treated with IR were ﬁxed for immunoﬂuorescent
staining as described (14). Mouse anti-BRCA1 (D-9, 1:200; Santa
Cruz) and RPA2 (NA18, 1:1,000; Calbiochem) and rabbit antiRAD51 (H-92, 1:200; Santa Cruz) and FANCD2 (NB100-182,
1:2,000; Novus) were used as primary antibodies. Images were
acquired with a microscope (TE2000, Nikon) and analyzed
using MetaVue (Universal Imaging). About 200 cells per experimental point were scored for presence of foci.
Western blot analysis
SDS-PAGE was done with whole-cell extracts as described
(14). Primary antibodies included mouse anti-BRCA1 (D-9,
1:200; Santa Cruz), Vinculin (V9131, 1:20,000; Sigma) and rabbit
anti-RAD51 (H-92, 1:2,000; Santa Cruz), REV1 (sc-48806, 1:400;
Santa Cruz), RAD51D (NB100-166, 1:2,000; Novus), RAD51C
(NB100-177C2, 1:2,000; Novus), and Actin (Sc-1616-R, 1:10,000;
Santa Cruz).
Real-time PCR
Total RNAs were extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
and reverse-transcribed using the Taqman microRNA Reverse
Transcription Kit or the Taqman cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems). The Taqman MiRNA Assay Kit or
Gene Expression Kit was used for quantitative PCR (qPCR)
reaction. The comparative Ct value was used for quantiﬁcation
of transcripts. RNU24 and 18S rRNA served as controls for
miRNA and gene expression, respectively.
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were pulse labeled with 30 mmol/L 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma) for 15 minutes and then ﬁxed with 70%
ice-cold ethanol. Cells were then stained for DNA content
(propidium iodide) and BrdUrd incorporation with anti-BrdUrd
rat monoclonal antibody (MAS250, Harlan Sera-Lab) followed
by ﬂuorescein isothiocynate-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch). Flow cytometry analysis was then
done to determine the distribution of cell cycle.
Homologous recombination assay
A U2OS cell clone stably expressing HR reporter direct
repeat of GFP (U2OS DR-GFP) was a gift from Drs. Maria Jasin
and Koji Nakanishi (35). U2OS DR-GFP cells were sequentially
transfected with siRNAs or miRNA mimics and pCBASce
vector. Two days later, cells were harvested and ﬁxed for ﬂow
cytometry analysis as previously described (14). The percentages of GFP-positive cells in hemagluttinin (HA)-positive
population were resulted from HR repair induced by DSBs.
Crystal violet assay
Cells were seeded onto 12-well plates at 1  104 cells/well
and treated with cisplatin, paclitaxel (Sigma), or AZD2281
(Axon Medchem). After incubation for 5 to 7 days, monolayers
were ﬁxed and stained for determination of chemosensitivity

as previously described (14). Cell survival was calculated
by normalizing the absorbance to that of nontreated controls.
Clonogenic survival assay
Chemosensitivity was also determined by a standard clonogenic survival assay (36). Brieﬂy, HeLa cells transfected with
microRNA mimics were seeded in 6-well plates, treated with
cisplatin for 24 hours, and then allowed to recover for 11 days.
Cells were ﬁxed and stained with crystal violet. Colonies with
50 cells or more were counted.
Luciferase assay
U2OS cells were cotransfected with miRNA mimics/inhibitors, pRL-TK Renilla plasmid, and pGL3-control ﬁreﬂy luciferase vectors containing empty, wild-type, or mutant RAD51
or REV1 30 -UTR sequence. Two days after transfection, cells
were lysed for measurement of luciferase activities using
the Dual-Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega). Relative luciferase
activity was calculated by normalizing the ratio of Fireﬂy/
Renilla luciferase to that of negative control-transfected cells.
Xenograft mice study
MDA-MB-231 cells (1  106) stably infected with lentivirus
producing control or pLemiR-96 were subcutaneously injected
into the ﬂank of 6 to 7 week old female nonobese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (NOD/SCID) mice (NOD.
Cg-Prkdc^(scid)il2rg^(tm1Wjl)/SzJ, FHCRC CCEMH). Mice

were randomized into 2 groups (9 mice each) and injected
with 20 mg/kg of cisplatin or PBS once the tumor was established (about 40 mm3). Tumor sizes were measured every 3 or 4
days after cisplatin treatment, and the volume was calculated
using the formula: Volume ¼ length  width2  0.52. TTV200
was the time of tumor volume reaching 200 mm3. The tumor
growth delay was deﬁned as: median of TTV200(treatment) 
median of TTV200(PBS). All the animal work was approved by
the FHCRC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Statistical analysis
All the statistic analyses were done with student t test
(paired, 2-tail). All results were expressed as mean  SD except
for survival results (mean  SE). P value < 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.

Results
MiR-96 is a negative regulator of RAD51 foci formation
The 3 miRNAs of miR-183-96-182 cluster have similar but
slightly different seed sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
We ﬁrst evaluated the effect of these miRNAs on RAD51 foci
formation following DNA damage individually. Ectopic expression of the miRNAs was conﬁrmed by real-time (RT-PCR) in
U2OS cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Overexpression of
miR-96, but not miR-182 or miR-183, signiﬁcantly reduced the
percentage of cells with at least 10 RAD51 foci (Fig. 1A and B,

Figure 1. MiR-96 inhibits DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci formation. A-C, U2OS cells were transfected with negative control (miR-neg) or miR-96
mimics (10 nmol/L), treated with ionizing radiation (IR; 10 Gy) and then ﬁxed for immunoﬂuorescent staining of RAD51, RPA2, FANCD2, or BRCA1 6 hours after
IR. Nuclei were counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The representative images of RAD51 immunostaining were shown in A.
Quantitation of relative percentage of cells with at least 10 foci (normalized to miR-neg-transfected cells) and average number of foci per cell were shown in
B and C, respectively. Scale bar, 20 mm (mean  SD, n ¼ 3). D, U2OS cells were transfected with miR-neg, miR-96, or miR-16, a known cell-cycle regulator (49).
After 48 hours, cells were processed for FACS analysis of cell-cycle proﬁle. E and F, U2OS cells were transfected with miR-neg or miR-96 and cells
were harvested 48 hours following transfection for Western blot analysis (E) or real-time RT-PCR.

47% reduction, P < 0.05) and the average number of RAD51 foci
per cell (Fig. 1C, P < 0.01) after treatment with IR. In contrast,
none of the 3 miRNAs signiﬁcantly affected IR-induced
FANCD2, BRCA1, or RPA2 foci formation (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of miR-96 also modestly, but signiﬁcantly, inhibited
cisplatin-induced RAD51 foci formation (Supplementary Fig.
S2). Overexpression of miR-96 had no signiﬁcant effect on cellcycle distribution (Fig. 1D), indicating that inhibition of RAD51
foci formation by miR-96 is not due to block of cell-cycle
progression. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-96 signiﬁcantly reduced the expression of RAD51 both at protein and
mRNA levels in U2OS cells, whereas it had no effect on protein
expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, and RAD51D (Fig. 1E
and F). These ﬁndings suggest that inhibition of RAD51 foci by
miR-96 is due to repression of RAD51 itself.
MiR-96 inhibits HR and enhances cellular sensitivity to
cisplatin and a PARP inhibitor
RAD51 plays a critical role in HR (37). Therefore, we examined the effect of miR-96 on HR by monitoring the population
of GFP-positive cells in U2OS DR-GFP cells (35). As expected,
depletion of BRCA2, a critical protein for loading RAD51 onto
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at DSB sites (37), signiﬁcantly
reduced HR efﬁciency by 3.2 fold (Fig. 2A and B; 15.3% vs. 4.7%;

P < 0.001). Overexpression of miR-96 led to a 2-fold reduction of
HR activity (Fig. 2A and B; 15.7% vs. 7.4%; P < 0.001), indicating
that miR-96 is a negative regulator of HR repair.
HR-deﬁcient cells are sensitive to cisplatin and PARP inhibitors (5, 38, 39). Consistent with the notion that miR-96 acts to
suppress HR, miR-96-transfected U2OS cells were more sensitive to cisplatin (Fig. 2C) and a PARP inhibitor, AZD2281
(Fig. 2D), than control cells. Overexpression of miR-96 also
reduced the expression of RAD51 in HeLa (cervical cancer cell)
and BRCA2-proﬁcient ovarian cancer cell line, PEO1 C4-2
(ref. 33; Supplementary Fig. S3C), and sensitized them to both
cisplatin and AZD2281 (Supplementary Figs. S3A and S3B).
Sensitization of HeLa cells to cisplatin by miR-96 overexpression was also conﬁrmed in clonogenic survival assays (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Furthermore, delivery of miR-96 primary
sequence using lentivirus (pLemiR-96) efﬁciently produced
miR-96 in U2OS cells (Supplementary Fig. S3E) and rendered
cells more sensitive to both cisplatin and AZD2281 compared to
cells infected with control virus (pLemiR-NSC; Supplementary
Figs. S3F and S3G). In contrast, overexpression of miR-96 did not
sensitize U2OS cells to paclitaxel (Fig. S3H), a widely used
chemotherapeutic agent that disrupts microtubule dynamics
(40). Therefore, miR-96–mediated sensitization to cisplatin and
a PARP inhibitor was not a result of general cellular toxicity.

MiR-96 in Chemosensitivity

Figure 3. Downregulation of RAD51 is critical for miR-96-mediated AZD2281 sensitivity, but not for cisplatin sensitivity. U2OS cells were infected with
retrovirus expressing control (ctrl) or RAD51. After 72 hours, cells were reseeded and transfected with miR-neg or miR-96 mimics. After another
48 hours, cells were either reseeded for AZD2281 (B) and cisplatin (C) sensitivity assays (mean  SEM, n ¼ 3) or harvested for Western blot analysis (A).
U2OS cells were infected with retrovirus producing shRNAs against control (ctrl) or BRCA1. After 72 hours, cells were reseeded and transfected with

harvested for Western blot analysis (D).

Downregulation of RAD51 is critical for
miR-96–mediated sensitization to a PARP inhibitor,
but not to cisplatin
Next, we examined whether reduction of RAD51 expression
by miR-96 is critical for cellular sensitivity to cisplatin and
AZD2281 in U2OS cells. Overexpression of DsRed-tagged
RAD51 (Fig. 3A) prevented miR-96–mediated sensitization to
AZD2281 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that miR-96–mediated AZD2281
sensitivity is primarily a result of RAD51 reduction. However, to
our surprise, overexpression of RAD51 had only a mild effect on
cisplatin sensitivity in miR-96-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3C).
This observation led us to hypothesize that miR-96–mediated
cisplatin sensitivity is not simply due to defective HR repair
mediated by RAD51 reduction. To test this hypothesis, we
evaluated the effect of miR-96 on chemosensitivity in HRdeﬁcient cells. ShRNA-mediated depletion of BRCA1, an
important regulator of HR (41), signiﬁcantly sensitized U2OS
cells to both AZD2281 and cisplatin (Fig. 3D–3F). Overexpression of miR-96 further sensitized BRCA1-depleted U2OS cells
to cisplatin (Fig. 3F), but not to AZD2281 (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-96 sensitized BRCA1-deﬁcient
breast cancer cell line HCC1937 (ref. 42; Supplementary
Fig. S4A) and BRCA2-deﬁcient ovarian cancer cell line PEO1

www.aacrjournals.org

(ref. 33; Supplementary Fig. S4D) to cisplatin, but not to
AZD2281 (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4E). These ﬁndings
support the notion that miR-96 overexpression sensitizes
cells to cisplatin by inhibiting another mechanism of chemoresistance in addition to HR.
Downregulation of REV1 is critical for miR-96–mediated
cisplatin sensitization
To further explore the molecular mechanism responsible
for miR-96–mediated cisplatin sensitization, we analyzed the
predicted targets of miR-96 from 3 algorithms (MiRanda,
TargetScan, and PicTar; Supplementary Table S1). Among the
top 100 predicted targets by each algorithm, 55 genes were
predicted by at least 2 algorithms (Supplementary Table S2).
We focused on REV1, an error-prone Y-family DNA polymerase
that is required for cellular resistance to cisplatin (7, 8). During
ICL repair, REV1 initiates TLS across the unhooked ICLs
followed by either HR-mediated repair or HR-independent
repair (7, 8). As expected, REV1 expression was signiﬁcantly
reduced in miR-96-overexpressing U2OS cells as shown by
both Western blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR (qRTPCR; Fig. 4A, B, and D, 3A and 3D). Overexpression of miR-96
also reduced the expression of REV1 in several other cancer

cell lines [(HeLa, PEO1 C4-2 (Supplementary Fig. S3C),
HCC1937 and PEO1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4F)].
Depletion of REV1 signiﬁcantly sensitized HR-proﬁcient
U2OS cells to cisplatin (Fig. 4C). It also increased cisplatin
sensitivity in HR-deﬁcient HCC1937 and PEO1 cells (Fig. S4A
and S4D), implying that downregulation of REV1 may contribute to miR-96–mediated cisplatin sensitivity in HR-deﬁcient
background. Indeed, miR-96 had only very mild effect on
cisplatin sensitivity in U2OS cells when both RAD51 and REV1
were ectopically overexpressed (Fig. 4D and E), suggesting that
miR-96 regulates cisplatin sensitivity mainly by repressing
RAD51 and REV1.
RAD51 and REV1 are direct targets of miR-96
The 30 UTR of RAD51 transcript contains a putative miR-96binding site (RAD51 MRE1, Fig. 5A) predicted by prediction
algorithms MiRanda and TargetScan (Supplementary Table
S1), whereas the 30 UTR of REV1 transcript contains a putative
miR-96-binding site (REV1 MRE, Fig. 5A) predicted by all
3 prediction algorithms (Supplementary Table S1). In addition,
the coding region of RAD51 contains another putative miR-96binding site (RAD51 MRE2, Fig. 5A). To show whether they
are direct targets of miR-96, we cloned the 30 -UTR of either
RAD51 or REV1 mRNA and the RAD51 MRE2 site with the
surrounding sequences downstream of the open-reading
frame of the luciferase gene of pGL3 vector (RAD51 30 UTR,
REV1 30 UTR, and RAD51 MRE2; Fig. 5A and B) and cotransfected either of them with miR-96 or negative mimics into

(REV1 30 UTR mutant, Fig. 5B) completely abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-96 on luciferase activity (Fig. 5C), implying
that REV1 mRNA is a direct target of miR-96.
Interestingly, miR-96 failed to affect luciferase activity of
the construct containing RAD51 30 UTR (Fig. 5C), but signiﬁcantly reduced that of the construct containing MRE2
(a potential miR-96-binding site in the coding region of
RAD51; Fig. 5A and C). Mutation of the MRE2 abrogated the
inhibitory effect of miR-96 on luciferase activity (Fig. 5C).
Accordingly, overexpression of miR-96 caused a mild reduction
of the ectopically expressed DsRed-tagged RAD51 (Fig. 3A,
lane 3 vs. lane 4 and Fig. 4D, lane 1 vs. lane 2), which does not
carry the 30 -UTR. These data suggest that RAD51 mRNA is also
a direct target of miR-96.
MiR-96 is broadly conserved across many species (Supplementary Fig. S5) as are the miR-96-binding sites in RAD51 and
REV1 transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S6), suggesting conservation of the trans-regulatory interactions between miR-96
and its targets, RAD51 and REV1.
Lastly, we examined whether REV1 and RAD51 are regulated
by miR-96 at physiologic levels of miR-96 expression. Transfection of a miR-96-speciﬁc inhibitor eliminated miR-96–mediated reduction of luciferase activity of REV1-30 UTR reporter
(Fig. 5D), suggesting that miR-96 was efﬁciently suppressed

MiR-96 in Chemosensitivity

Figure 5. RAD51 and REV1 are direct targets of miR-96. A and B, putative miR-96 binding sites (wild-type and mutants) in the transcripts of RAD51
or REV1. C, wild-type or mutant RAD51 30 -UTR, RAD51 MRE2, or REV1 30 -UTR were cloned into the pGL3 vector, as 30 fusions to the luciferase
gene. U2OS were cotransfected with the indicated miRNA mimics and luciferase vectors. Luciferase activity was assayed 48 hours later and
normalized to that of negative control-transfected cells (mean  SD, n ¼ 4). D, U2OS cells were cotransfected with plasmids and miRNA inhibitors
(25 nmol/L) as indicated. Cells were lysed for luciferase assay 48 hours later. E, HCT116 cells were transfected with miRNA mimics or inhibitors.

by this inhibitor. However, transfection of the miR-96 inhibitor
only mildly upregulated the expression of REV1 and RAD51 in
HCT116 cells (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that endogenous
levels of miR-96 downregulate REV1 and RAD51 very mildly
and that miR-96–mediated regulation is only one of the
mechanisms that regulate REV1 and RAD51 expression.
MiR-96 enhances chemosensitivity in a xenograft model
To further show the role of miR-96 in chemosensitization,
we tested the role of miR-96 on cisplatin sensitivity in a mice
xenograft model. Tumorigenic MDA-MB-231 human breast
cancer cells (43) were stably infected with lentivirus encoding

either non-targeting control or miR-96 (Fig. 6A). Overexpression of miR-96 reduced the expression of REV1 and RAD51 in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6B), and mildly, but signiﬁcantly,
sensitized MDA-MB-231 cells to cisplatin in vitro (Fig. 6C).
While cisplatin treatment or overexpression of miR-96 alone
only modestly prevented the tumor growth of xenografted
MDA-MB-231 cells (P > 0.05), overexpression of miR-96 strongly reduced tumor growth after cisplatin treatment during
the 3-week observation period (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, combinational treatment with cisplatin and miR-96 also caused a
7-day growth delay of tumor volume reaching 200 mm3 (about
4 times of the volume before cisplatin treatment), whereas

cisplatin or miR-96 alone elicited no and 3-day delay, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7). These data support the notion
that miR-96 is a potent cisplatin sensitizer in vivo.

Discussion
DNA-damaging agents are important therapeutic interventions for cancer therapy. However, their clinical use is
sometimes limited due to acquired chemoresistance. In this
study, we showed that miR-96 regulates DNA repair and
chemosensitivity by suppressing the expression of two
important DNA repair genes, RAD51 and REV1. The RAD51
recombinase promotes HR repair of DSBs and ICLs (37, 44).
REV1-mediated TLS plays a critical role both in cellular
resistance to ICL-inducing agents and in the development of
acquired chemoresistance (9). Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of RAD51 and REV1 is a theoretically valid strategy to
sensitize tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents and to prevent the development of chemoresistance, although there is
a concern that this combination may also lead to toxicity in
some normal tissues. Thus, miR-96, which downregulates
both RAD51 and REV1, can be a potentially powerful ther-

apeutic agent for improving the efﬁcacy of conventional
chemotherapy.
The miRNAs of the miR-183-96-182 cluster share similar
seed sequences and have been reported to share the same
targets such as Foxo1 (25, 29). However, we did not observe
signiﬁcant effects of miR-182 or miR-183 on either RAD51 foci
formation (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2) or cellular
sensitivity to cisplatin or AZD2281 (Supplementary Fig. S8).
These observations suggest that miR-96 is the critical miRNA of
this cluster responsible for inhibition of DNA repair and
chemosensitivity. During the preparation of this manuscript,
Moskwa and colleagues reported that the miR-183-96-182
cluster miRNAs are rapidly reduced after IR treatment in
HL-60 cells and MCF-7 cells and that overexpression of
miR-182 inhibits HR by reducing BRCA1 expression (43).
Consistent with this, we also found that expression of miR96 was rapidly, but modestly, reduced in U2OS cells after IR
(Supplementary Fig. S9). This in turn may allow efﬁcient
recruitment of DNA repair proteins (such as RAD51) to
DNA-damage sites. However, we did not see a signiﬁcant effect
of miR-182 on BRCA1 expression in U2OS cells (Supplementary
Fig. S10). This discrepancy may be due to different cell lines

MiR-96 in Chemosensitivity

used in these studies, as function and targets of miRNAs can be
context dependent (45). Nevertheless, both studies highlight
the important roles of the miR-183-96-182 cluster in DNA
repair and chemosensitivity.
The miR-183-96-182 cluster is located at chromosome 7q32,
a region surrounded by multiple important oncogenes such as
Met, CDK6, and BRAF (18). This region is often ampliﬁed in
cancer and the miR-183-96-182 cluster miRNAs are upregulated in many cancers and can promote cell proliferation,
migration, and metastasis by targeting multiple transcriptional factors (18, 19, 25, 29, 31, 32). Cooperation between miR-96–
mediated DNA repair deﬁciency and the oncogenic properties
of Met, CDK6, and BRAF may promote tumorigenesis. Inhibition of miR-96 mildly upregulated the expression of RAD51 and
REV1 in some cancer cell lines (Fig. 5E), but the physiologic role
of miR-96 in the regulation of DNA repair remains unclear and
will require further investigation. Whether miR-96 expression
levels can serve as a prognostic marker to predict the chemosensitivity of tumor is another important question to be
addressed in the near future.
Importantly, multiple studies suggest that ectopic expression of the miR-183-96-182 cluster may have therapeutic
potential, despite their oncogenic potential. Overexpression
of miR-96 inhibits pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis by decreasing the expression of KRAS (46). Overexpression of miR-183
inhibits migration of breast cancer cells (31, 32), whereas
overexpression of miR-182 suppresses the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells (47, 48). Our current
study showed that overexpression of miR-96 caused a mild
growth defect in multiple cell lines, such as U2OS (Supplementary Fig. S11) and in a xenograft model (Fig. 6D). Importantly, overexpression of miR-96 strongly potentiated the
ability of cisplatin to inhibit tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 6D).
All these studies support the idea that overexpression of miR183-96-182 can shift their oncogenic roles towards tumorsuppressive functions, and that combining their expression

with DNA-damaging agents may lead to substantial beneﬁt
for tumor management.
Taken together, miR-96 is an important regulator of DNA
repair and a potential therapeutic agent (chemosensitizer)
for cancer. Future studies will address whether miR-96 mimic
may be useful as a chemosensitizer in therapy for certain
types of cancer.
