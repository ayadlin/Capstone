and Adaptation to Antiangiogenic Treatment in Glioblastoma

Abstract
Antiangiogenic therapy leads to devascularization that limits tumor growth. However, the beneﬁts of
angiogenesis inhibitors are typically transient and resistance often develops. In this study, we explored the
hypothesis that hypoxia caused by antiangiogenic therapy induces tumor cell autophagy as a cytoprotective
adaptive response, thereby promoting treatment resistance. Hypoxia-induced autophagy was dependent on
signaling through the hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a)/AMPK pathway, and treatment of hypoxic cells with
autophagy inhibitors caused a shift from autophagic to apoptotic cell death in vitro. In glioblastomas, clinically
resistant to the VEGF-neutralizing antibody bevacizumab, increased regions of hypoxia and higher levels of
autophagy-mediating BNIP3 were found when compared with pretreatment specimens from the same patients.
When treated with bevacizumab alone, human glioblastoma xenografts showed increased BNIP3 expression and
hypoxia-associated growth, which could be prevented by addition of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. In vivo
targeting of the essential autophagy gene ATG7 also disrupted tumor growth when combined with bevacizumab
treatment. Together, our ﬁndings elucidate a novel mechanism of resistance to antiangiogenic therapy in which
hypoxia-mediated autophagy promotes tumor cell survival. One strong implication of our ﬁndings is that
autophagy inhibitors may help prevent resistance to antiangiogenic therapy used in the clinic. Cancer Res; 72(7);

Introduction
The hypothesis that tumor progression can be curbed by
antiangiogenic agents targeting abnormal tumor vessels has
been conﬁrmed by preclinical evidence and clinical trials (1).
However, these initial successes were tempered by the failure
of angiogenesis inhibitors to produce enduring clinical
responses. For example, in clinical trials of VEGF-neutralizing
antibody bevacizumab in glioblastoma, 40% to 60% of tumors
progressed after initially successful treatment (2), consistent
with the development of resistance to antiangiogenic therapy,
a state exhibiting a poor prognosis and poor response to
available treatments (3). The molecular basis of acquired
resistance to antiangiogenic treatments causing this lack of
sustained responses remains undeﬁned. We hypothesized that
the devascularization caused by antiangiogenic therapy
increases tumor hypoxia and that this hypoxia mediates
resistance to antiangiogenic therapy.

Recent reports suggest that hypoxia activates autophagy, a
lysosomal degradation pathway which may promote tumor
cell survival (4). The mechanisms by which hypoxia induces
autophagy need clariﬁcation, but the ﬁnding that BNIP3, a
hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) downstream target gene,
is essential to hypoxia-induced autophagy suggests one possible mechanism (5).
During autophagy, a crescent-shaped structure, the isolation
membrane, forms in the cytoplasm and closes around components targeted for destruction, leading to formation of the
autophagosome, which fuses with the lysosome to become an
autolysosome, leading to enzymatic degradation of autophagosome contents (6). While autophagosomes were initially
identiﬁed in dying cells, a phenomenon that led to the term
"autophagic cell death" to describe a cell death mode distinct
from apoptosis, subsequent studies have shown that autophagy can allow cells to cope with stressors by destroying
damaged proteins and organelles as a survival-promoting
mechanism (7–9). During autophagosome formation, the
ATG7 protein is essential for autophagosome membrane
expansion (10).
While autophagosomes sequester cytosolic material nonspeciﬁcally in a process called nonselective autophagy, additional evidence shows that a process of selective autophagy
also occurs in which autophagic degradation of speciﬁc protein aggregates or organelles targeted for destruction occurs.
Selective autophagy degrading–speciﬁc proteins is associated with degradation of p62 (11), a protein complex that
binds ubiquitinated protein aggregates to target them for

degradation, or BNIP3, a marker of autophagic destruction of
mitochondria. Nonselective autophagy can involve microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), a protein that, after
conversion from its cytosolic form LC3-I to its autophagosome
membrane–associated form LC3-II, is ultimately degraded by
lysosomal enzymes in autolysosomes during nonselective
autophagy, causing the total amount of LC3 (LC3-I plus
LC3-II) to drop (6).
We report here that increasing tumor hypoxia occurs during
antiangiogenic therapy and increases tumor cell autophagy as
a cell survival mechanism, a novel resistance mechanism to
antiangiogenic therapy. We then investigated the role of hypoxia-upregulated pathways in promoting autophagy. We
showed the translational impact of this novel mechanism of
resistance to antiangiogenic therapy by showing in animal
models that pharmacologic or genetic autophagy disruption
prevented hypoxia-associated resistance to antiangiogenic
therapy. On the basis of the targetable novel mechanism of
resistance to antiangiogenic therapy described here, combining antiangiogenic therapy with autophagy inhibition is a
therapeutic strategy warranting further investigation in malignant cancers like glioblastomas.

hours, subcultured cells were selected in 1 mg/mL puromycin for
1 week. Lysates from stably selected cells were assessed for
ATG7 expression by Western blotting.
Western blotting
Western blotting was carried out as described in the Supplementary Methods.
Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays
A total of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates in triplicate
were plated overnight, then treated with DMSO, 3-MA (1
mmol/L), or BafA1 (5 nmol/L) under normoxia or hypoxia for
48 hours. For extended treatment (72 hours), cells were treated
with DMSO, BafA1 (1, 2.5 nmol/L), or chloroquine (10 or 25
mmol/L). Relative cell numbers were measured by CellTiter 96
Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). For
apoptosis assays, one million cells per well were plated in 6-well
plates overnight, then treated with DMSO, 1 mmol/L 3-MA, or 1
nmol/L BafA1 for 24 hours. Apoptotic and necrotic cells were
measured by FITC-Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kits (BD
Pharmingen), with FACS carried out with a BD FACSCalibur II
machine with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents
Cell lines and protocols for primary tumor cell isolation are
described in Supplementary Methods. A total of 300,000 cells
per well were plated in 12-well plates overnight in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium with 10% FBS, then cultured under
normoxia (5% CO2, 20% O2, 74% N2) or hypoxia (5% CO2, 1% O2,
94% N2) in a humidiﬁed O2 control incubator (Sanyo) never
opened during incubation. Cells were incubated for 3, 6, 16, and
24 hours in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; control), baﬁlomycin A1
(BafA1, 1 nmol/L), 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 1 mmol/L), chloroquine (10 mmol/L), or YC-1 (10 mmol/L; Sigma). To quantify
GFP-LC3 punctate in U373/GFP cells, 5 random 40 ﬁelds
were photographed and the average percentage of cells per
ﬁeld containing more than 10 intracellular GFP-LC3 punctate
dots was calculated.
Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR is described in Supplementary Methods.
siRNA transfection
A total of 300,000 cells per well in 12-well plates were
transfected overnight using METAFECTENE transfection
reagent (Biontex Laboratories) with 20 nmol/L of negative
control, HIF-1a, or AMPKa siGENOME SMARTpool siRNAs
(Dharmacon, Inc.), which combine 4 siRNAs into a single pool.
After culture with fresh medium for 24 hours, knockdown was
conﬁrmed by Western blotting.

Xenografts
Procedures are described in Supplementary Methods. After
tumors were established (mean subcutaneous volume ¼ 32
mm3 or 7 days postintracranial implantation), 5 (subcutaneous
tumors) or 10 (intracranial tumors) mice per group were
randomly allocated to treatment groups (Supplementary
Methods). Tumors were measured with calipers twice weekly.
Tumor volume was (width)2  length/2, and fold-growth was
relative to treatment day one. Treatment continued until mice
reached IACUC euthanasia criteria (2.1 cm maximal dimension
or tumor symptoms). To measure tumor oxygenation, some
mice received 60 mg/kg pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe, Inc.)
intraperitoneally 1 hour before euthanasia.
Human tissue and xenograft immunohistochemistry
Parafﬁn-embedded sections and xenografts were processed
as described in Supplementary Methods. Photographs were
taken with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 and a Zeiss Axiocam color CCD.
Staining quantiﬁcation is described in Supplementary
Methods.
Statistics
Two group comparisons of nonnormal values were carried
out using the Wilcoxon signed rank (paired samples, e.g., preand posttreatment) or Wilcoxon rank-sum (unpaired) tests.
For subcutaneous tumor volumes, initial comparison of 3 or
more groups used the Kruskal–Wallis test (nonparametric
alternative to ANOVA), followed by subsequent post hoc
testing using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for 2 group analyses.
Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to compare survival between
groups. P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant, except for the post
hoc Wilcoxon rank-sum testing, for which a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing required using ak < 0.01 (i.e., 0.01 ¼
0.05/k, where k ¼ 5) to deﬁne signiﬁcance. Error bars are SDs,

immunostaining, and double the CA9 immunostaining), suggesting that, while irinotecan inhibition of HIF-1a expression
(15) was more than offset by bevacizumab-induced devascularization and hypoxia-inducible gene expression.

Patient tumors resistant to antiangiogenic therapy
exhibit increased hypoxia compared with before
treatment
Review of an institutional database of 234 bevacizumabtreated glioblastomas from 2006 to 2010 revealed 6 cases
meeting the following criteria: (i) after initial radiographic
response to bevacizumab as monotherapy (n ¼ 2) or combined
with topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan (n ¼ 4), these cases
exhibited the nonenhancing FLAIR bright growth on MRI seen
in bevacizumab-treated glioblastomas (12, 13); (ii) surgical
resection of the bevacizumab-resistant tumor occurred within
28 days of last bevacizumab dose; and (iii) archived paired preand posttreatment tissue was available. Tumor vessel density,
assessed by CD31 immunostaining, decreased nearly 60% after
bevacizumab resistance compared with pretreatment specimens from these patients (P < 0.001), meanwhile hypoxiainducible genes HIF-1a and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9; ref. 14)
immunostaining increased nearly 70% (Fig. 1, P < 0.05) and 80%
(Fig. 1, P < 0.05), respectively. These trends persisted when
separating cases into those growing during bevacizumab

Hypoxia induces autophagy in human glioblastoma cell
lines
Brieﬂy culturing U87MG and T98G glioma cell lines in
hypoxia caused at least 2 autophagy-associated changes that
progressively accumulated at 3, 6, 16, and 24 hours: degradation of total LC3 (LC3-I plus LC3-II) and p62 were seen in
U87MG and T98G cells (Fig. 2A–C). Of note, LC3-II expression
increased over time in normoxia, consistent with basal autophagy due to metabolite accumulation (16), but this autophagy
was clearly increased by hypoxia. Minimal contribution of
transcriptional changes to hypoxia-induced autophagy was
suggested by the ﬁnding that hypoxia-associated alterations
in levels of LC3A, LC3B, and p62 transcripts were insigniﬁcant
(P ¼ 0.1–0.9, Supplementary Fig S1) and did not correlate with
hypoxia duration, consistent with prior reports (17, 18). Similar
results were observed in U251, U138MG, A172, and G55 glioblastoma cell lines (Figs. 2D, Supplementary Fig. S2A). LC3-I to
LC3-II conversion, a third autophagy-associated change (19),
was seen in hypoxic T98G (Fig. 2B), U251 (Fig. 2D), and G55
(Supplementary Fig. S2A) cells. We further conﬁrmed hypoxia-

examined (Fig. 2E).
Hypoxia upregulates autophagy in primary
glioblastoma cells
Because primary cells might respond differently to hypoxia
than cell lines, we studied the ability of hypoxia to induce
autophagy-associated protein changes in primary glioblastoma cells from freshly resected human glioblastomas. Hypoxia
induced the same autophagy-associated changes found in cell
lines, degradation of p62 and total LC3, in the primary human
glioblastoma cells SF8244, SF8167, SF8106, and SF7796, with 2
of these primary human glioblastoma cells also exhibiting
hypoxia-induced LC3-I to LC3-II conversion (Figs. 2F, Supplementary Fig. S2A). Because the ATG4 protease modiﬁes LC3
(20), we investigated ATG4 expression in cells exhibiting
(T98G, SF8167, and SF7796) or not exhibiting (SF8106) hypoxia-induced LC3-I to LC3-II conversion. ATG4A and ATG4B
homologues were not detectable in these cells (data not
shown), whereas ATG4C expression decreased slightly with
hypoxia in T98G and the 3 primary glioma cells (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that ATG4C did not contribute to the

We used immunohistochemistry to identify hypoxic areas
and areas that stained positive for autophagy mediator
BNIP3 in 6 bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas and the
paired pretreatment glioblastomas from these same
patients. The increased hypoxia of these specimens after
bevacizumab resistance compared with before was quantiﬁed earlier. While the core of hypoxic areas in these bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas was often necrotic, the
hypoxic periphery of these necrotic areas stained positive
for autophagy-mediating factor BNIP3 (Fig. 1A). Tumors
exhibited increased BNIP3 immunoreactivity after bevacizumab failure in a manner reﬂecting the greater hypoxia
seen after resistance to antiangiogenic therapy (Fig. 1A),
with image analysis revealing 55% more BNIP3 immunostaining in the 6 glioblastomas after bevacizumab resistance
than in tumors from the same patients before bevacizumab
treatment (Fig. 1B, P < 0.001). These trends persisted when

Autophagy Mediates Resistance to Antiangiogenic Therapy

Figure 3. Autophagy inhibitors block the hypoxia-induced expression of autophagy mediators in glioma cells. A, after 24 hours, 3-MA (1 mmol/L) and BafA1
(1 nmol/L) blocked hypoxia-induced p62 degradation in cultured U87MG cells. 3-MA inhibited conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, whereas BafA1 increased LC3-I
to LC3-II conversion. B, after 24 hours of hypoxia, U373/GFP-LC3 cells exhibited more punctate green ﬂuorescent staining, consistent with autophagy, which

immunostaining).
Autophagy inhibitors disrupt hypoxia-induced
glioblastoma autophagy
Early autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and late autophagy inhibitor
BafA1 both blocked hypoxia-induced p62 degradation (Fig.
4A). 3-MA inhibited LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, whereas late
autophagy inhibitor BafA1 increased LC3-I to LC3-II conversion (Fig. 3A), reﬂecting the fact that these inhibitors disrupt
autophagy either before (3-MA) or after (BafA1) LC3-I to LC3-II
conversion. Similar effects were seen in U373 cells transduced
to express a GFP-LC3 fusion protein, with hypoxia increasing
autophagy, as assessed by the number of cells with punctate
green staining, a marker reduced by early autophagy inhibitors,
and Western blotting for free GFP released by autophagic
degradation, a marker reduced by early and late autophagy
inhibitors (16). Early autophagy inhibitor 3-MA lowered the
number of cells with punctate green staining in hypoxia, and
late autophagy inhibitor BafA1 maintained the high number of
cells with punctate green staining seen in hypoxia (Figs. 3B and
C, P < 0.01). Similarly, hypoxia increased free GFP identiﬁed
by Western blotting over 3-fold, with free GFP lowered by early

(3-MA) or late (BafA1) autophagy inhibitors, particularly the
latter (Supplementary Fig. S4),
Inhibiting hypoxia-induced autophagy increases cell
death
Next we measured cell survival under hypoxic culturing
conditions in the presence of either 3-MA or BafA1. BafA1
signiﬁcantly decreased the number of viable U87MG and
T98G cells in hypoxia (Fig. 4A, P < 0.05), with 3-MA having
slightly less inhibitory effects on cell viability (Fig. 4A, P ¼ 0.06).
Having shown a survival-promoting effect of hypoxia-induced
autophagy, we characterized the type of cell death occurring in
hypoxia when autophagy was inhibited. We conducted ﬂow
cytometry after using Annexin V (AnnV) and propidium iodine
(PI) to label hypoxic U87MG cells that had been treated with and
without autophagy inhibitors. In the presence of 3-MA or BafA1,
hypoxia signiﬁcantly increased the number of cells that were
AnnVþPIþ (late-stage apoptosis; BafA1, P < 0.01; 3-MA, P < 0.05),
whereas the number of AnnVþPI cells in early apoptosis did
not change (Fig. 4B, P > 0.05). The percentage of total PARP that
was active or cleaved, an apoptosis marker, increased in hypoxic
cells treated with autophagy inhibitors, with lesser effects seen
in normoxia (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the cell death promoted
when autophagy was inhibited was apoptotic.

Dependence of various aspects of hypoxia-induced
autophagy on HIF-1a or AMPK
Pathways activated by hypoxia in tumor cells that can
contribute to autophagy include those mediated by HIF-1a,
activated during physiologic hypoxia (O2, 0.1%–3%), or by HIF1a–independent 50 AMP–activated protein kinase (AMPK),
activated during anoxia (0.01% O2; ref. 4). At 1% O2, both
HIF-1a and AMPK were activated in U87MG and T98G cells,
with HIF-1a activation occurring earlier than AMPK activation
(Fig. 5A). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPK
or HIF-1a blocked hypoxia-mediated LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and total LC3 degradation but neither siRNA affected
hypoxia-mediated p62 degradation (Fig. 5B). Similarly, HIF-1a
inhibitor YC-1 (21) blocked hypoxia-mediated total LC3 degradation and LC3-I to LC3-II conversion but did not affect
hypoxia-mediated p62 degradation (Fig. 5C). We then investigated the role of HIF-1a or AMPK in the hypoxia-mediated
BNIP3 expression identiﬁed earlier. Hypoxia-induced BNIP3
expression was reduced with HIF-1a inhibition achieved
through HIF-1a siRNA (Fig. 5B) or YC-1 (Fig. 5D). In contrast,
AMPK inhibition achieved through AMPK siRNA failed to alter
hypoxic induction of BNIP3 (Fig. 5B). Therefore, hypoxiamediated LC3-I to LC3-II conversion depended on HIF-1a and
AMPK, hypoxia-mediate BNIP3 expression depended on HIF1a not AMPK, and hypoxia-mediated p62 degradation
occurred independent of these pathways.
Combined inhibition of autophagy and angiogenesis
exerts a potent antitumor effect in vivo
3-MA and BafA1 are typically used as autophagy inhibitors in
vitro (22), but chloroquine or hydroxyl-chloroquine, late autophagy inhibitors like BafA1, are used to inhibit autophagy in vivo
(23), partly because they are the only U.S. Food and Drug

1778

Administration (FDA)-approved autophagy inhibitors. Like
BafA1, chloroquine blocked hypoxia-induced p62 degradation,
but by blocking autophagy after LC3-I to LC3-II conversion,
caused more LC3-I to LC3-II conversion to occur in cultured
U87MG, GBM39, and G55 glioma cells (Supplementary Figs.
S2B and S5A), and decreased the viability of U87MG (P < 0.05,
Supplementary Fig. S5B) and G55 (P < 0.05, Supplementary Fig.
S2C) in hypoxia compared with normoxia. We also examined
the effect of chloroquine on BNIP3 expression in 5 cell lines and
xenograft-derived cells and found that, whereas hypoxia
increased BNIP3 expression in all cells, chloroquine minimally
affected BNIP3 expression under normoxia or hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S5C), consistent with prior in vitro reports (24),
and suggesting that late autophagy inhibitor chloroquine
exerted its effects downstream of BNIP3 upregulation.
We then investigated whether chloroquine counteracted the
survival-promoting effects of hypoxia-induced autophagy
caused by antiangiogenic treatment by treating subcutaneous
tumors derived from GBM39 primary glioma cells with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and/or antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab. After 4 weeks, tumor volumes differed between the 4
treatment groups (P < 0.05) and, compared with PBS, neither
chloroquine nor bevacizumab inhibited tumor growth (P ¼
0.3–0.8). Combined therapy (bevacizumab þ chloroquine)
inhibited tumor growth in a prolonged and signiﬁcant manner
versus either agent alone (P < 0.01, bevacizumab vs. bevacizumab þ chloroquine; P < 0.005, chloroquine vs. bevacizumab
þ chloroquine; Fig. 6A). Bevacizumab-treated tumors, with or
without combined chloroquine, exhibited 4- to 6-fold reduced
vessel density (P < 0.01) and over double increased hypoxic area
(P < 0.05), compared with PBS-treated tumors or tumors
treated with chloroquine monotherapy (Fig. 6B), conﬁrming
that antiangiogenic therapy induced devascularization and

hypoxia. While bevacizumab monotherapy increased BNIP3
expression nearly 2-fold over than PBS or chloroquine treatment (P < 0.05), adding chloroquine to bevacizumab reduced
BNIP3 expression to levels comparable with PBS- or chloroquine-treated tumors (Fig. 6B, P < 0.05). Cell death in these
xenografts was characterized using terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining to detect cells in late apoptosis, and staining increased over
2-fold in chloroquine-treated xenografts compared with PBStreated xenografts (P < 0.01) and nearly 4-fold in bevacizumab
plus chloroquine–treated xenografts compared with bevacizumab-treated xenografts (Fig. 6B, P < 0.05).
Similar sustained tumor growth inhibition in combined
treated tumors versus eventual accelerated growth in bevacizumab-treated tumors was noted in subcutaneous U87MG
tumors (P < 0.005 for 4 group comparison; P < 0.01, bevacizumab vs. bevacizumab þ chloroquine; Supplementary Fig. S6A)

For U87MG-derived xenografts, prolonged treatment of the
bevacizumab monotherapy and bevacizumab plus chloroquine groups for 2 additional weeks increased the separation
between the 2 groups, with bevacizumab-treated tumors exhibiting an increased growth rate, and the combined treatment
tumors exhibiting sustained growth suppression (P < 0.01,

U87MG xenografts revealed similar ﬁndings as seen with
GBM39–decreased vessel density and increased hypoxia in
bevacizumab-treated xenografts, increased BNIP3 expression
in bevacizumab-treated xenografts, and increased TUNEL
staining in chloroquine-treated xenografts (Supplementary

Autophagy Mediates Resistance to Antiangiogenic Therapy

after bevacizumab treatment, consistent with autophagy, and
after chloroquine treatment, consistent with our in vitro data
reﬂecting the fact that chloroquine is a late autophagy inhibitor
(Supplementary Fig. S6D).
Another patient specimen–derived subcutaneous xenograft,
SF8244, exhibited similar sustained lack of growth in combined
treated tumors versus eventual accelerated growth in bevacizumab-treated tumors (P < 0.01 for 4 group comparison,
Supplementary Fig. S7B). Delayed chloroquine addition to
bevacizumab-treated SF8244 tumors that had reached
volumes averaging 400 mm3 reduced tumor volume whereas
bevacizumab-treated tumors continued exponential growth
(P < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. S7B), suggesting that inhibiting
autophagy upon initiation of resistant growth could still
suppress antiangiogenic therapy resistance. Chloroquine alone
did not affect tumor growth compared with PBS in any
xenografts (P ¼ 0.4–0.7).
Knockdown of essential autophagy gene ATG7 promotes
bevacizumab responsiveness in vivo
Because chloroquine could exert nonspeciﬁc effects, to more
precisely deﬁne the contribution of autophagy to antiangiogenic therapy resistance, we engineered U87MG and SF8557
glioma cells to stably express 3 different shRNAs targeting
autophagy-mediating gene ATG7 (Supplementary Fig. S8A).
Cells expressing the shRNA causing greatest ATG7 knockdown
exhibited inhibition of 2 hypoxia-mediated autophagy-associated protein changes, p62 degradation, and LC3-I to LC3-II
conversion (Supplementary Fig. S8B). We treated subcutaneous tumors derived from U87MG/shControl and U87MG/
shATG7 cells and intracranial tumors derived from SF8557/
shControl and SF8557/shATG7 cells with PBS or bevacizumab.
Whereas subcutaneous U87MG/shControl (Fig. 6C) and intracranial SF8557/shControl (Fig. 6D) tumors exhibited no
response to bevacizumab (P ¼ 0.3–0.8), all subcutaneous
U87MG/shATG7 tumors regressed to cure (Fig. 6C, P <
0.001) and intracranial SF8557/shATG7 tumors exhibited
90% long-term survival (Fig. 6D) with bevacizumab treatment
(P ¼ 0.003). Immunostaining subcutaneous and intracranial
shRNA–transduced tumors except for bevacizumab-treated
subcutaneous U87MG/shATG7 tumors, which were cured,
revealed that bevacizumab decreased vascularity and
increased hypoxia in shControl- and shATG7-transduced
ectopic and orthotopic tumors (P < 0.05, Supplementary Fig.

S9), consistent with our in vivo results with other bevacizumabtreated tumors. BNIP3 expression increased with bevacizumab
treatment of shControl- and shATG7-transduced tumors (P <
0.05, Supplementary Fig. S9), with the former consistent with
our other in vivo results and the latter consistent with a prior
report (25).

Discussion
Cells exposed to various stressors undergo a process of selfdigestion known as autophagy, during which cytoplasmic
cargo sequestered inside double-membrane vesicles are delivered to the lysosome for degradation. Several in vitro studies
suggest that, while autophagy initially prevents cancer cell
survival, once a tumor develops, autophagic self-catabolization
of damaged organelles promotes cell survival by allowing
tumor cells to survive the hypoxia and the nutrient and growth
factor deprivation (7–9) found in the tumor microenvironment. Suggestion that autophagy promotes tumor cell survival
in vivo comes from the correlation of immunostaining for
autophagy-promoting BNIP3 with poor cancer survival (26,
27). Several cancer therapies induce autophagy (28–30), and
the autophagic response to some treatments is cytoprotective
(31).
Because of the failures of conventional DNA-damaging
chemotherapy, antiangiogenic therapy has been investigated,
with efﬁcacy showed in several cancer clinical trials. However,
this efﬁcacy is often transient with acquired resistance to
antiangiogenic therapy common (32). While antiangiogenic
therapy can transiently normalize structural and functional
abnormalities in tumor vessels (33), the long-term effect of
antiangiogenic therapy is tumor devascularization, which ultimately worsens tumor hypoxia.
We hypothesized that hypoxia, as occurs after antiangiogenic therapy (34), would promote autophagy as a cytoprotective adaptive mechanism. Others have shown that hypoxia
upregulates autophagy-associated factors, like BNIP3 (35), a
ﬁnding supported by the identiﬁcation of BNIP3 expression in
perinecrotic regions of patient tumor specimens (36), but
whether the response is cytoprotective and which pathways
are involved remain undetermined.
The cytoprotective nature of autophagy during hypoxia
induced by antiangiogenic therapy was veriﬁed by our
in vitro data showing decreased survival of cells treated

Figure 6. Autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (Chloro) combined with bevacizumab (Bev) inhibits GBM39 tumor growth in vivo. A, subcutaneous tumors in
athymic mice were treated with PBS, chloroquine, bevacizumab, and chloroquine plus bevacizumab. After 4 weeks, there were signiﬁcantly different
tumor volumes amongst groups (P < 0.05). Compared with PBS (black), neither chloroquine (pink) nor bevacizumab (blue) inhibited tumor growth
(P ¼ 0.3–0.8). Combined therapy with bevacizumab and chloroquine (red) inhibited tumor growth in a prolonged and statistically signiﬁcant manner
relative to either agent alone (P < 0.01, bevacizumab vs. bevacizumab þ chloroquine; P < 0.005, chloroquine vs. bevacizumab þ chloroquine). B, vessel
density (CD31 staining, red) decreased in bevacizumab-treated tumors (P < 0.01). Hypoxia (CA9 staining, green) increased in bevacizumab-treated tumors
(P < 0.05). BNIP3 expression (green) increased with bevacizumab treatment (P < 0.05), an increase eliminated by adding chloroquine to bevacizumab
(P < 0.05). TUNEL staining (red) increased in chloroquine-treated tumors (P < 0.05). 40 , 6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear counterstaining is blue.
Bevacizumab plus chloroquine–treated tumors were small enough that the entire tumor ﬁt one ﬁeld of view. Magniﬁcation, 20; scale bar, 200 mm. C, when
subcutaneous U87MG/shControl and U87MG/shATG7 xenografts were treated with PBS or bevacizumab, U87MG/shATG7 tumors completely regressed
with bevacizumab treatment (P < 0.001), whereas U87MG/shControl xenografts were minimally responsive (P ¼ 0.8). D, intracranial SF8557/shATG7
xenografts exhibited 90% long-term survival with bevacizumab treatment, whereas PBS treatment of intracranial SF8557/shATG7 xenografts led to 18-day
median survival (P ¼ 0.003). Intracranial SF8557/shControl xenografts exhibited 15-day median survival with PBS, similar to their 18-day median survival with
bevacizumab (P ¼ 0.3).

with autophagy inhibitors in hypoxic conditions, particularly
with late autophagy inhibitors, and more so at 72 hours
(Supplementary Fig. S5B) than 48 hours (Fig. 4A) and our
in vivo data showing increased TUNEL staining in chloroquine plus bevacizumab–treated xenografts compared with
bevacizumab-treated xenografts (Fig. 6B, Supplementary
Fig. S6C), suggesting an increased number of apoptotic cells
during combined treatment. Of note, while chloroquine
consistently exerted antitumor effects in hypoxic conditions
in vitro and when combined with antiangiogenic therapy
in vivo, it promoted tumor growth, albeit in a manner not
quite statistically signiﬁcant, in normoxic U87MG cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5B) and as monotherapy compared
with PBS in G55 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Similarly, in addition to potentiating the response to antiangiogenic therapy, ATG7 knockdown caused faster in vivo growth
of PBS-treated tumors than wild-type tumors. These ﬁndings
illustrate the dual functions of autophagy—a tumoricidal
effect under normoxic unstressed conditions, such that
autophagy inhibition under those conditions can actually
promote tumor growth, versus a tumor-protective effect
upon exposure to stressors like the hypoxia caused by
antiangiogenic therapy. These dual functions of autophagy
suggest that inhibiting autophagy may be of limited clinical
value alone but, when used with antiangiogenic therapy,
could provide a therapeutic beneﬁt. These ﬁndings also
suggest that the effect we observed in vivo was not the
additive effect of combining 2 antitumor agents but instead
reﬂected the ability of one therapeutic modality, antiangiogenic treatment, to turn another modality, autophagy inhibition, with mild tumor-promoting effects into a true antitumor strategy.
The tumor response to hypoxia activates several factors,
including HIF-1a-, felt to activate at moderate hypoxia
(0.1%), and HIF-1a–independent AMPK, felt to activate at
anoxia (0.01%; ref. 4). We found that at 1% oxygen, a
concentration more typical of glioblastomas than 0.1% or
0.01% (37), both HIF-1a and AMPK were activated, with HIF1a activated earlier than AMPK, suggesting that, different
durations of hypoxia, not just different hypoxia levels, may
differentially activate these pathways. Both HIF-1a and
AMPK could contribute to autophagy, with mTOR inhibition
a possible mechanism (38–41). We found that hypoxiamediated LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and overall LC3 degradation depended on both HIF-1a and AMPK, hypoxiamediated BNIP3 expression depended on HIF-1a not AMPK,
and hypoxia-mediated p62 degradation was independent of
HIF-1a and AMPK. While LC3 contributes to nonselective
autophagy (degradation of bulk cytoplasmic contents
including organelles), p62 degradation and BNIP3 expression are more involved in selective autophagy destroying
ubiquitinated proteins and mitochondria, respectively.
Future studies will need to clarify mediators of hypoxiainduced p62 degradation.
Interestingly, chloroquine minimally affected BNIP3
expression in our cultured cells, consistent with prior
reports using cultured colon carcinoma cells treated with
BafA1, another late autophagy inhibitor (42), and suggesting

1782

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

that chloroquine inhibited autophagy downstream of BNIP3
expression. In contrast, chloroquine lowered BNIP3 expression in bevacizumab-treated xenografts. The differences
between these in vitro and in vivo results could reﬂect as
yet uncharacterized factors in the microenvironment absent
in cultured cells, or could reﬂect the longer treatment
duration tumors were exposed to in vivo than in culture,
potentially increasing cell death and reducing in vivo BNIP3
expression. Tumors derived from cells transduced to express
shRNA targeting essential autophagy gene ATG7 exhibited
slightly increased BNIP3 expression, consistent with a prior
report in which genetic disruption of ATG7 eliminated
autophagy but led to a slight increase in BNIP3 expression
that could not trigger autophagy in the setting of ATG7 loss
(25).
Our ﬁndings are signiﬁcant because we show that targeting
autophagy through pharmacologic or genetic means disrupts
antiangiogenic therapy resistance in vivo. While some of these
observations were made in ectopic subcutaneous tumors,
because of our ﬁndings of the importance of hypoxia in
resistance to antiangiogenic therapy and reports that orthotopic murine intracranial tumors exhibit less hypoxia than
ectopic subcutaneous tumors and that the hypoxia of the latter
more closely resembles human glioblastoma (43, 44), our
ﬁndings in subcutaneous tumors should be pertinent to
glioblastoma.
Chloroquine, a clinically approved antimalaria drug, has
been studied in a randomized glioblastoma trial combining
chloroquine with conventional treatment with a beneﬁt not
quite signiﬁcant (45). Currently more than 20 phase I/II
cancer clinical trials involving chloroquine or hydroxylchloroquine are open nationwide (24). Furthermore, while chloroquine plus antiangiogenic therapy in our xenografts was
not curative, chloroquine exerts numerous nonspeciﬁc
effects, incompletely disrupts autophagy, and achieves maximal plasma concentration (46) 10-fold lower than the concentrations inhibiting hypoxia-induced autophagy in vitro.
Thus, our ﬁnding that genetic disruption of essential autophagy gene ATG7 dramatically increased response to antiangiogenic therapy from no response to curative, suggests
that long-term evaluation of autophagy inhibitors in treating
antiangiogenic therapy resistance will require more speciﬁc
and potent autophagy inhibitors currently being developed
(24).
