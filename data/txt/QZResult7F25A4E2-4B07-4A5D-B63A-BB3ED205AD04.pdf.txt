Abstract
Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPG) are reactive eicosanoids that may display anti-inflammatory and
antiproliferative actions, possibly offering therapeutic potential. Here we report the identification of members of
the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family as selective targets of the cyPG prostaglandin A1 (PGA1). AKR enzymes
metabolize aldehydes and drugs containing carbonyl groups and are involved in inflammation and tumorigenesis. Thus, these enzymes represent a class of targets to develop small molecule inhibitors with therapeutic
activity. Molecular modeling studies pointed to the covalent binding of PGA1 to Cys299, close to the active site of
AKR, with His111 and Tyr49, which are highly conserved in the AKR family, playing a role in PGA1 orientation.
Among AKR enzymes, AKR1B10 is considered as a tumor marker and contributes to tumor development and
chemoresistance. We validated the direct modification of AKR1B10 by biotinylated PGA1 (PGA1-B) in cells, and
confirmed that mutation of Cys299 abolishes PGA1-B incorporation, whereas substitution of His111 or Tyr49
reduced the interaction. Modification of AKR1B10 by PGA1 correlated with loss of enzymatic activity and both
effects were increased by depletion of cellular glutathione. Moreover, in lung cancer cells PGA1 reduced
tumorigenic potential and increased accumulation of the AKR substrate doxorubicin, potentiating cell-cycle
arrest induced by this chemotherapeutic agent. Our findings define PGA1 as a new AKR inhibitor and they offer a
framework to develop compounds that could counteract cancer chemoresistance. Cancer Res; 71(12); 4161–71.

Introduction
Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (cyPG) are endogenous
reactive eicosanoids which display varied biological actions
including inhibition of proinflammatory gene expression and
modulation of cell proliferation and redox status (1–3). cyPG
arise from the spontaneous dehydration of various PG or from
nonenzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid. These eicosanoids possess an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl group in the
cyclopentene ring which confers them a high reactivity toward
nucleophiles, such as thiol groups, and can lead to the formation of covalent adducts by Michael addition. This property
is essential for cyPG biological actions (4), including PPAR

activation (5) and inhibition of NF-kB and AP-1 transcription
factors (1, 6). A- and J-series cyPG were initially observed to
share several protein targets and biological actions (7–9).
However, recent studies have shown that cyPG with different
structures may target selective subsets of cellular proteins
(10), and even different residues within the same protein. Ras
proteins and histone deacetylases constitute examples of this
intra- and intermolecular selectivity (9, 11). Identification of
the factors involved in the selectivity of protein modification
by different cyPG, as well as of the selectively modified targets,
could unveil potential opportunities for drug discovery.
Using proteomic approaches we have identified proteins of
the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family as targets for selective
modification by PGA1 compared with 15-deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). AKR enzymes are involved in the
metabolism of several ketones and aldehydes and play important roles in pathophysiology (12). Among them, AKR1B10
exerts key roles in tumor biology. AKR1B10, first identified in
human hepatocarcinoma (13), is overexpressed in colorectal,
breast and lung cancer, for which it is considered a diagnostic
marker (14, 15), and may play a pathogenic role in hepatocellular carcinoma (16) and in tobacco-related carcinogenesis
(14, 17). Proposed AKR1B10-mediated tumorigenic mechanisms include retinoic acid depletion and cancer cell dedifferentiation (18, 19) as well as chemoresistance due to
metabolism of carbonyl group–bearing anticancer drugs

(20). Therefore, AKR1B10 constitutes a primary target for the
development of inhibitors with anticancer potential.
Here we have confirmed the direct modification of
AKR1B10 by PGA1-B and show that this cyPG inhibits AKR
activity. Moreover, PGA1 treatment potentiated the effects of
the carbonyl group–containing drug doxorubicin. These
results provide a novel approach for the inhibition of AKR1B10
which could be exploited in the design of strategies to overcome cancer chemoresistance.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Prostanoids and their biotinylated analogues [15d-PGJ2biotin (15d-PGJ2-B) and prostaglandin A1-biotin (PGA1-B)] were
from Cayman Chemical. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–streptavidin and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were
from GE Biosciences. Neutravidin-agarose was from Pierce.
Anti-aldose reductase (sc-33219) and anti-GAPDH (sc-32233)
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and anti-AKR1B10 from
Origene.
Cell culture and treatments
NIH-3T3, H1299, and COS-7 cells were from ATCC. A549
and Calu-3 cells were gifts of Dr. F. Rodríguez-Pascual (21, 22)
and Dr. A. Silva, respectively. All cells were used within
6 months after resuscitation. NIH-3T3 and COS-7 cells were
cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen)
containing 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. A549 cells were grown in
RPMI1640 with the above supplements plus 50 mg/mL gentamycin. For treatments, cells at a confluence of 80% to 90%
(COS-7) or 60% to 70% (A549) were incubated in serum-free
medium, unless otherwise stated. Cell fractionation into S100
and P100 fractions was done as described (23).
Protein identification
S100 fractions from control or PGA1-B–treated NIH-3T3
cells were purified on neutravidin beads and analyzed by
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MSMS; ref. 23). Total cell lysates (100 mg of total protein) from
control, and 15d-PGJ2-B– or PGA1-B–treated NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were analyzed by 2D-electrophoresis as described
(24). Gels run in duplicate were either transferred to Immobilon-P membranes to specifically detect proteins which had
incorporated the biotinylated PG with HRP–streptavidin
and ECL or stained with colloidal Coomassie blue. Gel
images were aligned and spots of interest were excised
and proteolyzed with trypsin as detailed previously (23,
25). Digests (0.5 mL) were spotted onto a MALDI target in
1 mL of matrix (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid). Matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was carried out on a calibrated Ultraflex time-of-flight mass spectrometer in reflectron mode
(Bruker Daltonik). All mass spectra were internally calibrated with trypsin autolysis peaks at m/z 842.51 and m/z
2,211.10. Peptide masses were searched against the IPI
Human database using MASCOT version 2.0.02 (Matrix

Sciences). Identifications were accepted when a minimum
of 6 peptide masses matched a particular protein (mass
error of  50 ppm allowing 1 missed cleavage), sequence
coverage was more than 30%, MOWSE scores were higher
than the threshold value (P ¼ 0.05), and the predicted
protein mass agreed with the gel-based mass.
Molecular modeling

The 1.65 A resolution crystal structure of NADPþ-bound
human aldose reductase (AKR1B1) was used as a model (PDB:
1ADS code). Addition of missing hydrogen atoms and computation of the protonation state of ionizable groups at pH 6.8
were carried out by using the Hþþ Web server (26), which
relies on AMBER (27) force-field parameters and finite difference solutions to the Poisson–Boltzmann equation. The
charge distribution for PGA1-B, in which B was replaced by
a methyl group, was obtained by fitting the quantum mechanically calculated (RHF 6-31G*\\3-21G*) molecular electrostatic
potential to a point charge model, as implemented in Gaussian 03 (Gaussian, Inc.).
The Lamarckian genetic algorithm implemented in AutoDock 3.0.5 (28) was used to generate automated poses of PGA1
docked within the binding site of AKR employing a dielectric
constant of 2. Consistent bonded and nonbonded AMBER
"gaff" parameters (parm03) were assigned to PGA1 atoms and
a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the selected complex in the presence of explicit water (a truncated octahedron
containing 4 Naþ ions to achieve electroneutrality) was run for
5 nanoseconds by using periodic boundary conditions. Initially, positional restraints of 5 kcal/mol on the protein a-carbons and harmonic restraints on the distances between the
keto-group of PGA1 and His111 Ne and between the electrophilic carbon of PGA1 and the sulfur atom of Cys299 were
applied. After 1 nanosecond, all the restraints were removed
and the solvated complex was allowed to evolve freely.
Plasmids and transfections
The plasmid pCMV6-XL5 containing human AKR1B10 ORF
was from Origene. The insert was cloned into the pCEFL-KZAU5 plasmid to yield AU5-AKR1B10 wild type (wt). The C299S,
H111A, and Y49F mutants were generated by site-directed
mutagenesis by using oligonucleotides, 50 -CTGGAGGGCCTCTAACGTGTTGCAATCCTCTCATTTGG-30 , 50 -GGACGTCTATCTTATTGCCTGGCCACAGGGATTCAAGTCTGG-30 , and
50 -CTGTGCCTATGTCTTTCAGAATGAACATGAAGTGGG-30 ,
and their complementary reverse oligonucleotides, respectively. All constructions were sequenced. COS-7 cells
in 6-well dishes were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000,
using 2 mg of DNA per well.
AKR activity assay
Cells were lysed in 50 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH
6.8), and S100 fractions were used for AKR activity measurements. Assay mixtures contained 50 mg of protein, 10 mmol/L
D,L-glyceraldehyde, and 200 mmol/L NADPH in 100 mmol/L
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). After 20-minute incubation
at room temperature NADPH consumption was monitored by
measuring the absorbance at 340 nm in an Ultrospec 4300 pro

spectrophotometer (GE Biosciences). Enzymatic activity was
expressed in nmol/min/mg of protein.
Doxorubicin detection
Intracellular doxorubicin was detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope,
using excitation and emission wavelengths of 470 and
590 nm (29). Doxorubicin fluorescence was quantitated by
flow cytometry on an EPICS Coulter analyzer, using the above
excitation and emission settings.
Cell migration and clonogenic assay
For wound-healing assays cells were grown to confluence
and the monolayer was scratched with a 200 mL pipette tip.
The width of the scratch was measured at 3 points in each
well, and at various time points after treatment with the
indicated agents. Relative migration was calculated as the
percentage of distance migrated compared with the control
well. Anchorage-independent growth was assessed as
described (30). Cells were cultured for 3 weeks with 3 weekly
medium replacements. Colonies were visualized by ethidium
bromide staining on an UV transilluminator.
Cell-cycle analysis and detection of apoptosis
Cells treated with the various agents were detached with
trypsin/EDTA and fixed with 70% ethanol in PBS. Immediately
before flow cytometry analysis, cells were centrifuged and
resuspended in 0.5% NP-40, 25 mg/mL propidium iodide and
25 mg/mL RNase A, and incubated in this solution for 15
minutes at room temperature. Apoptosis was detected by
binding of Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, as
described (31).
Statistical analysis
Experiments were carried out at least 3 times. Results are
presented as average values  SEM. Average values were
compared by Student's t test for unpaired observations.

Results
PGA1B selectively modifies AKR enzymes in NIH-3T3
fibroblasts
We have previously reported that biotinylated analogues
of the cyPG 15d-PGJ2 and PGA1, selectively modify specific
subsets of cellular proteins in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (10). To
identify selective targets of each cyPG we incubated cells
with concentrations of 15d-PGJ2-B or PGA1-B resulting in a
similar extent of total protein modification (10), and subsequently carried out subcellular fractionation. We detected
a prominently labeled band at 37 kDa, appearing selectively
in S100 fractions from PGA1-B–treated fibroblasts (Fig. 1A).
To identify this selective PGA1-B target we employed a
proteomic strategy following the enrichment of biotin-containing proteins by avidin chromatography, as schematized
in Figure 1B and detailed in Supplementary Figure S1.
Consistent with our previous work, initial proteomic analysis of this band identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH; ref. 23). However, immunoprecipi-

tation of GAPDH did not recover the PGA1-B–selective
target, which remained in the nonretained fraction (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that the presence of the abundant protein GAPDH was hampering identification of the
comigrating PGA1-B target. Consequently, combining
GAPDH immunodepletion, avidin chromatography, and
LC/MS-MS analysis (Fig. 1B; and Supplementary Fig. S1)
allowed the identification of aldose reductase (AKR1B1) as a
putative selective target for PGA1-B (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To directly evidence covalent addition of PGA1-B to AKR
enzymes we conducted 2D-electrophoresis. Samples from
control, 15d-PGJ2-B, and PGA1-B–treated cells were resolved
in duplicate gels used for transfer and detection of AKR
proteins or biotin-positive spots, or for Coomassie blue
staining and protein identification (Fig. 1C). Two spots were
detected by the anti-AKR antibody; spot 1 showed pI and
apparent molecular weight consistent with AKR1B1;
MALDI-TOF MS analysis of spot 2 identified aldose reductase-related protein-2 (AKR1B8), an AKR family member
expressed in murine fibroblasts. Both spots matched biotin
positive spots only in the sample from PGA1-B–treated cells
(Fig. 1C, right), confirming the selectivity of their modification by PGA1-B. Moreover, the presence of AKR enzymes in
the avidin-bound fraction from PGA1-B–treated cells, but
not from control cells was confirmed by Western blot
(Fig. 1D).
Molecular modeling studies of the interaction of PGA1
with AKR enzymes
In our proposed binding mode for PGA1 in the AKR1B1
active site, the keto-group is accepting hydrogen bonds from
both the Ne-protonated His111 and the hydroxyl of Tyr49
(Fig. 2A). These interactions, which remained stable during
the unrestrained MD simulations, facilitate the orientation of
the cyclopentenone ring in such a way that the electrophilic
carbon is at a suitable distance from the sulfur atom of Cys299

(i.e., 4.0 A) thus making it possible for the Michael reaction to
proceed and yield a covalent adduct. Furthermore, in the case
of the biotinylated analogue, PGA1-B, the amide bond between
PGA1 and the spacer (Fig. 4) can establish an additional
hydrogen bonding interaction with the side-chain carboxamide of Gln50 whereas the biotin moiety would be found
facing the solvent. Consistent with the observed selectivity of
the modification, the interactions predicted by this model
could not be established in the case of the J series cyPG, 15dPGJ2 (data not shown).
The AKR family consists of more than 100 members, and
significant homology exists among many of them (Fig. 2B).
Moreover, the residues predicted by the molecular model to
be involvedin the interaction of PGA1 with the enzymeare highly
conserved among several members of this family. Given the
high degree of sequence identity between AKR1B1 and
AKR1B10, especially within the active site region (Fig. 2B),
the mode of binding of PGA1 and PGA1-B to these 2 enzymes
is expected to be identical. Given its significance in tumor
biology, we used AKR1B10 for subsequent studies addressing
the interactions of PGA1 with AKR enzymes and their functional
implications.

excised and subjected to tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF MS. The identification data are summarized at the bottom. D, S100 fractions from control or
PGA1-B–treated fibroblasts were subjected to neutravidin chromatography and the retention of AKR enzymes was assessed by Western blot.

Cysteine 299 is essential for PGA1-B binding to
AKR1B10
PGA1-B clearly formed a stable adduct with AKR1B10 in
cells transiently transfected with an AU5-AKR1B10 construct,
as assessed by SDS-PAGE and biotin detection (Fig. 3A).
Remarkably, mutation of Cys299 to Ser virtually abolished
the incorporation of PGA1-B into AKR1B10, indicating that
this residue is critical for PGA1-B binding. Interestingly, mutation of either Tyr49 or His111 reduced the incorporation of
PGA1-B, suggesting that the presence of these residues favors
the interaction of the cyPG with the active site of the enzyme
as predicted by the model.

We next addressed the functional consequences of
AKR1B10 modification by PGA1. Endogenous AKR activity
was negligible in COS-7 cells (see Fig. 3C). Transfection of
AU5-AKR1B10 produced measurable AKR activity, which was
inhibited by treatment with either PGA1 or PGA1-B by more
than 60% (Fig. 3B), without altering AU5-AKR1B10 protein
levels. In contrast, 15d-PGJ2-B at a concentration eliciting a
degree of total protein modification similar to that achieved
with PGA1-B, induced only marginal AKR1B10 labeling, and a
weak inhibition of AKR activity (15%) was observed in 15d-PGJ2–
treated cells (data not shown). Remarkably, PGA1-elicited
inhibition was abolished in cells transfected with AKR1B10

Cys299Ser, confirming the importance of Cys299 for both
PGA1 binding and inhibitory effect (Fig. 3C). Consistent with
previous observations, the AKR1B10 Cys299Ser mutant displayed lower activity than the wt variant, reportedly due to
reduced affinity for the D,L-glyceraldehyde substrate (32).
Mutation of Tyr 49 or His111 abolished activity (data not
shown), confirming their importance in catalysis (33).
Inhibition of AKR activity by various cyclopentenones
Given the potential biomedical interest in AKR inhibitors,
we characterized PGA1 effect in more detail. PGA1 inhibition
of AKR1B10 activity in COS-7 cells was time- and concentration-dependent (IC50, 43 mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S2).

www.aacrjournals.org

Several PGA1-related compounds including PGA2, 8-isoPGA1, and 8-iso-PGA2 inhibited AKR1B10 activity (Fig. 4).
Interestingly, the isoprostanes 8-iso-PGA1 and 8-iso-PGA2,
isomers of the respective PG, were significantly less effective
than their PG counterparts, suggesting that the trans orientation of the PG side chain with respect to the prostane ring is
more favorable for interaction with the enzyme. Remarkably,
2-cyclopentenone did not inhibit AKR1B10, suggesting that
the chains of the PG are important for docking at the active
site. Of the 2 reported inhibitors of AKR enzymes, fenofibrate
(34) and AD-5467 (35), only the latter showed a potent
inhibitory effect. AKR and actin levels were not affected under
the conditions of the assay (Fig. 4).

PGA1 inhibits AKR activity in human lung
adenocarcinoma A549 cells
In search for a biologically relevant model to assess PGA1
effects, we explored the levels of AKR1B10 in A549, H1299,
and Calu-3 lung cancer cells, of which only A549 cells
showed detectable levels (Supplementary Fig. S3). PGA1
reduced cell viability and induced cell-cycle alterations in
all cells studied to variable extents (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Consistent with a role of AKR1B10 in detoxification and cell
survival, A549 cells showed reduced susceptibility to PGA1
effects. Treatment of A549 cells with PGA1-B elicited the
selective retention of endogenous AKR proteins, and specifically of AKR1B10, on avidin–agarose beads (Fig. 5A), indi-

cating that PGA1-B modifies AKR enzymes in this cell type.
Moreover, PGA1 and PGA1-B effectively inhibited AKR activity without altering AKR protein levels (Fig. 5B). According
to previous evidence, reduced glutathione (GSH) forms
stable adducts with PGA1-type PG potentially reducing
interactions with proteins (36). We previously showed that
GSH depletion enhances PGA1-B binding to cellular proteins
(10). Consistent with this, treatment of A549 cells with
buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH synthesis inhibitor,
improved PGA1-B incorporation into proteins and increased
retention of biotin-tagged proteins onto neutravidin beads
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Moreover, GSH depletion specifically increased AKR retention on avidin after PGA1-B treatment (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, BSO showed a tendency to
reduce AKR activity per se and significantly potentiated
PGA1-elicited AKR inhibition (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these
results indicate that maintenance of GSH levels or of redox
status is important for AKR function. In addition, GSH
depletion facilitates AKR modification and inhibition by
PGA1.
Effects of PGA1 on A549 cells tumorigenicity and drug
resistance
PGA1 inhibited A549 cell migration in a wound healing
assay (Fig. 6A) and reduced anchorage-independent clonogenic growth (Fig. 6B), thus suggesting an inhibition of
tumorigenic potential. AKR1B10 is involved in the metabolism
of a variety of anticancer compounds, including doxorubicin
and daunorubicin, potentially leading to chemoresistance (32,
37). Therefore, we explored whether PGA1 could improve
doxorubicin efficiency. The main mechanism for doxorubicin
action at clinically relevant concentrations is the stabilization
of a cleaved ternary topoisomerase II–doxorubicin–DNA complex, resulting in a blockade in the G2 phase of the cell cycle
(38–40). Doxorubicin treatment induced a concentrationdependent increase in the proportion of A549 cells present
in the G2–M phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 6C, left), an effect that
was clearly potentiated by PGA1 (Fig. 6C, right). This effect was
associated with an improvement of doxorubicin availability in
cells. PGA1 clearly potentiated intracellular accumulation of
doxorubicin at several concentrations of the drug, as assessed
by flow cytometry (Fig. 6D). Confocal fluorescent microscopy
confirmed PGA1-elicited potentiation of doxorubicin retention, mainly at the nuclear compartment (Supplementary
Fig. S5). The AKR inhibitor AD-5467 mimicked the effects
of PGA1 both on cell-cycle distribution and doxorubicin
accumulation (data not shown). Taken together, these results
suggest that PGA1 treatment through inhibition of AKR
activity in A549 cells, may increase the accumulation of the
AKR substrate doxorubicin and potentiate its biological
effects, helping to counteract multidrug chemoresistance.

Discussion
Proteomic studies are shedding light into the signaling and
targets of endogenous electrophiles, unveiling novel mechanisms of action and providing opportunities for drug discovery
(23). Our results identify AKR1B10, an enzyme involved in

tumor development and cancer chemoresistance, as a selective target for modification and inhibition by A-class cyPG.
Moreover, we showed that PGA1 inhibits AKR activity in lung
cancer cells, reduces their migration and anchorage-independent growth, reflecting reduced invasiveness, and potentiates
the effect of the antitumoral agent doxorubicin, a known
AKR1B10 substrate. Therefore, the PGA1–AKR1B10 interaction could be explored for the development of novel strategies
against tumor chemoresistance.

www.aacrjournals.org

Insight into the structural basis for the preferential interaction of PGA1 with AKR enzymes was obtained by molecular
docking and confirmed by biochemical characterization of
site-specific mutants of AKR1B10. AKR1B10, like other AKR
enzymes, is a monomeric protein with an (a/b)8 barrel
structure containing the active site. Residues His111, Tyr49,
K79, and Asp44 line the active site, play a key role in catalysis,
and are highly conserved in the AKR family (12). Cys299 is
located close to the active site and modulates the interaction

of substrates and inhibitors with the enzyme. Molecular
modeling studies postulated the formation of a Michael
adduct between PGA1 and AKR involving Cys299, with
Tyr49 and His111 playing a facilitating role. Interestingly,
mutagenesis studies confirmed the requirement for Cys299
for covalent addition of PGA1-B to AKR1B10, whereas Tyr49
and His111 were required for optimal binding. Cys299 was also
required for PGA1-mediated inhibition of AKR1B10, confirming the functional importance of the interaction. Importantly,
both PGA1 and PGA1-B displayed similar inhibitory effects,
indicating that, in agreement with the modeling results, the
biotin moiety does not interfere with the interaction. Indeed,
we have confirmed modification and inhibition of recombinant AKR1B1 by both compounds (B.D-D., unpublished data).
Given the important implications of AKR1B10 in tumor
development and cancer chemoresistance, the search for
inhibitors of this enzyme is a thriving area of research.
Several compounds have been found to display AKR1B10
inhibitory properties in vitro, including some nonsteroidal

anti-inflammatory drugs (41), butein (42), and curcumin
derivatives (43). Our results suggest that PGA-type cyPG
may constitute a novel class of AKR inhibitors. PGA1 binding
to AKR1B10 shows unique characteristics among several
recently identified inhibitors for this enzyme (41, 43), for
which Gln114, Val301, and Gln303 or Ser304 were found to
be the critical interacting residues. It would be interesting to
explore whether modifications of the PGA1 structure could
be designed to increase the specificity or potency of the
inhibition. Concentrations of PGA1 used in this work should
be considered pharmacologic because they are at least 3
orders of magnitude higher than those measured in biological systems (44).
A549 cells constitute a widely used cellular model of lung
carcinoma and express several AKR isoforms, of which
AKR1B10 is the most abundant (45). As AKR1B10 is involved
in detoxification of various carbonyls, it could also confer
increased resistance to PGA1 or to reactive species generated
during PGA1 treatment. The finding that blocking GSH

a strategy to improve the antitumoral action of PGA1-type

cells is associated with an improvement of the effects of
doxorubicin, a widely used drug in the therapy of lung (46)
and other cancers (47). Doxorubicin clinical efficacy, however, is limited by the development of cancer cell resistance
due to induction of drug detoxification mechanisms, including conversion by AKR enzymes to the less effective metabolite doxorubicinol (37). It should be noted that although

most studies on doxorubicin action have been conducted
with micromolar concentrations, the effects herein reported
occur at nanomolar doxorubicin concentrations. This is
closer to the levels measured in the plasma of patients
receiving the drug (25–250 nmol/L) and that expected to
occur in vivo within the tumor microenvironment (48).
The fact that the AKR inhibitor AD-5467 mimics PGA1elicited potentiation of doxorubicin actions suggests
that inhibition of AKR may be involved in PGA1 effects.
Nevertheless, because PGA1 may bind to multiple cellular
targets (23), it could exert other cellular actions contributing

to the improvement of doxorubicin effectiveness, including
induction of reactive oxygen species, modulation of GST
activity or GSH content, and interference with drug efflux.
These possibilities will be the subject of further studies.
In summary, our study identifies AKR enzymes as prominent PGA1-selective targets. Moreover, PGA1 binds covalently
and inhibits AKR1B10 establishing specific interactions with
the enzyme and potentiates the effects of the antitumoral drug
doxorubicin. These results unveil novel possibilities to overcome cancer chemoresistance.
