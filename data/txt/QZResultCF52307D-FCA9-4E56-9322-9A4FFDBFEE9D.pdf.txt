ABSTRACT
In cancer cells, failure of chemotherapy is often caused by the ATP-binding
cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), and few drugs have been successfully
developed to overcome ABCB1-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR). To suppress
ABCB1 activity, we previously designed and synthesized a new series of derivatives
based on 20(S)-protopanoxadiol (PPD). In the present study, we investigated the
role of PPD derivatives in the function of ABC transporters. Non-toxic concentrations
of the PPD derivative PPD12 sensitized ABCB1-overexpressing cells to their anticancer substrates better than either the parental PPD or inactive PPD11. PPD12
increased intracellular accumulation of adriamycin and rhodamine123 in resistant
cancer cells. Although PPD12 did not suppress the expression of ABCB1 mRNA or
protein, it stimulated the activity of ABCB1 ATPase. Because PPD12 is a competitive
inhibitor, it was predicted to bind to the large hydrophobic cavity of homologymodeled human ABCB1. PPD12 also enhanced the efficacy of adriamycin against
ABCB1-overexpressing KB/VCR xenografts in nude mice. In conclusion, PPD12
enhances the efficacy of substrate drugs in ABCB1-overexpressing cancer cells. These
findings suggest that a combination therapy consisting of PPD12 with conventional
chemotherapeutic agents may be an effective treatment for ABCB1-mediated MDR
cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

is the most common reason for MDR in various types
of tumors [3–5].
Although there are several different ABC transporters
associated with the development of MDR, ABCB1,
ABCG2 and ABCC1 are the most important [6–10].
ABCB1 was the first human ABC transporter implicated
in MDR [11–13]. ABCB1 expression is a marker of
chemo-resistance and decreased survival in leukemia,
lymphoma, osteosarcoma, small-cell lung cancer, ovarian
cancer, breast cancer, and other malignancies [14].

Multi-drug resistance (MDR), which is the resistance
to anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents with different
targets, reduces the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy
[1, 2]. There are a variety mechanisms underlying MDR
in cancer, including the induction of anti-apoptotic
machinery, increased drug efflux, and reduced drug
uptake. Among these causes, over-expression of adenine
triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters

Using the energy of ATP hydrolysis, ABCB1 pumps
out a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs from
tumor cells, including the taxanes, epipodophyllotoxins,
vinca alkaloids and anthracyclines [15]. Therefore,
suppressing the activity or decreasing the expression
of ABCB1 could restore the sensitivity of MDR
cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and allow for
successful chemotherapy in patients with MDR due to
ABCB1-overexpression [16]. Several chemicals can
sensitize MDR cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, with
promising preclinical and early clinical data [17, 18].
Unfortunately, several critical problems, including
cytotoxic effects, altered drug pharmacokinetics, and
adversely modified drug distribution have prevented these
chemicals from a successful translation to the clinic.
Ginsenosides are the active ingredients of Panax
ginseng, which has been used as a dietary supplement in
Asia for over two thousand years. Within the ginsenoside
family, ginsenoside Rg3 has been reported to reverse
ABCB1-mediated MDR [19, 20]. Ginsenoside Rg3 is
metabolized to 20(S)-protopanoxadiol (PPD) by intestinal
bacteria, and this metabolite also has been reported to have
anti-cancer activity and via inhibition of ABCB1. Given
the extremely low toxicity of the compound, PPD is an
attractive candidate as a chemo-sensitizer for treatment
of MDR tumors [21–24]. To improve the effects of PPD,
we previously designed and synthesized a series of PPD
derivatives with aromatic substituted aliphatic amine at the
24 positions [25]. In this study, we demonstrate that PPD12,
compared to its parental compound PPD and inactive
compound PPD11, sensitizes ABCB1-medidated MDR
cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo.

non-ABCB1 substrate Cisplatin (CDDP) in KB, MCF-7
and HEK293 cells. The summary IC50 values are shown
in Tables 1–3. Compared with PPD and PPD11, PPD12
exhibited a reversal effect to ADM but not to CDDP.
PPD12 dose-dependently overcame resistance to ADM
in both KB/VCR and MCF-7/ADM cells, but not in KB
or MCF-7 cells. The known ABCB1 inhibitor Verapamil
had similar effects in reverse. Furthermore, PPD12 did not
alter the cytotoxicity of CDDP in any of the cells. Thus,
thee one-carbon linear chain in the aromatic substituted
aliphatic amine in the PPD12 was more effective than PPD
in reversing MDR (Figure 1C), while PPD11, the analog
with 4-methoxy- benzenamine substitution, was unable to
overcome MDR (Tables 1–3).
To examine the influence of PPD derivatives on
other ABC transporters, we also examined anti-MDR
effects in ABCC1-overexpressing (HL60/ADM) and
ABCG2-overexpressing (S1-Mi-80) cell lines. Both cell
lines were more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents than
their parent lines (Table 4). However, PPD12 at 5 μM
concentration only slightly reduced resistance to ADM
(also the substrate of ABCC1) in ABCC1-overexpressing
(HL60/ADM) cells and to Topotecan (also the substrate
of ABCG2) in ABCG2-overexpressing (S1-MI-80)
cells (Table 4). We therefore focused on examining the
effects of PPD12 on ABCB1-mediated MDR, rather than
ABCC1- or ABCG2-mediated MDR.

PPD12 inhibits ABCB1 transport but does not
change ABCB1 expression
Reversal of ABCB1-mediated MDR can be
achieved either by inhibiting ABCB1 pump activity or by
decreasing the expression of the protein [26]. To study the
effect of PPD12 on ABCB1 expression, we measured both
protein and mRNA levels using immunoblotting and realtime PCR analysis. KB/VCR and MCF-7/ADM cells had
higher expression of ABCB1, while their parental cells
had extremely low expression (Figure 2A–2B). Ectopic
expression of ABCB1 was also higher in the HEK293/
ABCB1 cells than the HEK293 cells (Figure 2A–2B).
After a 48 h incubation with up to 10 μM PPD12 there was
no effect on ABCB1 mRNA or protein levels in KB/VCR
cells (Figure 2C–2D). We next performed a time-course
experiment using 5 μM PPD12, and found no influence
of this dose on ABCB1 levels even after a 72 h incubation
(Figure 2C–2D).
We next examined the effects of PPD derivatives on
the ATPase activity of ABCB1. The well-studied ABCB1
inhibitor, Verapamil, was used as a positive control, as this
compound stimulates ABCB1-mediated ATP hydrolysis.
As shown in Figure 3A, PPD12 enhanced the ATPase
activity of ABCB1 in a dose-dependent manner with an
EC50 value of 1.52 μM, while the original compound PPD
stimulated ATPase activity with an EC50 value of 3.13 μM,
suggesting that PPD12 is a substrate of ABCB1.

RESULTS
PPD12 enhances the sensitivity of MDR cells to
ABCB1-substrates
To reproduce MDR, we performed an MTT assay
and confirmed that ABCB1-overexpressing cell lines
(KB/VCR in Table 1, MCF-7/ADM in Table 2 and
HEK293/ABCB1 in Table 3) have a higher tolerance
for chemotherapeutic agents than their parental lines,
making them suitable to evaluate the anti-MDR efficacy
of PPD derivatives. To investigate the anti-proliferative
effects of PPD derivatives (chemical structures shown in
Figure 1A–1C) on MDR cancer cells, we first examined
the cytotoxicity of PPD, PPD11, and PPD12 in three
ABCB1-overexpressing cell lines with the MTT assay.
Although there were differences in susceptibility to PPD,
PPD11, and PPD12 (Figure 1D), all the IC50 values were
higher than 6 μM. Therefore, a concentration of 5 μM
was selected as the maximum working concentration for
these derivatives in subsequent assays. We next tested
the cytotoxicity of the PPD derivatives in combination
with the ABCB1 substrate Adriamycin (ADM) and the

Consistent with the data from the cell viability assay, the
inactive derivative PPD11 induced ABCB1 activity with
an EC50 value of 2.38 μM (Figure 3A). These data indicate
that PPD12 acts as a competitive inhibitor to reduce the
transport function of ABCB1, without altering mRNA or
protein expression.

MCF-7/ADM cells (Figure 3C). As shown in Figure 3D,
ADM and Rho123 fluorescence was higher in the parental
cells than the MDR cells. However, PPD12 incubation
increased the fluorescent signals of ADM and Rho123
in KB/VCR and MCF-7/ADM cells without affecting
the parental cells. In both KB/VCR and MCF-7/ADM
cells, the ADM content of cells was increased after ADM
treatment. However, 5 μM PPD12 in combination with
ADM enhanced the accumulation of ADM in a time- and
dose-dependent manner (Figure 3E). These data suggest
that PPD increases the ADM content in MDR cells.

PPD12 increases the accumulation of ADM
and Rho123 in ABCB1-overexpressing cells by
inhibiting the efflux of ABCB1 substrates
To investigate whether intracellular ADM
accumulation is mainly through inhibition of efflux, we
designed a time-course study to measure ADM efflux in the
absence or presence of PPD12 in KB/VCR and KB cells.
The KB and KB/VCR cells were treated with 5 μM ADM
for 3 h at 37°C, followed by two washes with ice-cold
PBS and subsequently maintained in ADM-free medium
at 37°C in the absence or presence of 5 μM PPD12. ADM
accumulation in KB/VCR cells was decreased to 79.43%,
69.53%, 55.8%, 48.77% and 43.47% in the absence
of PPD12 at the indicated time points. In contrast, the
percentages of remaining ADM were 89.37%, 81.3%,
73.53%, 67.3% and 60.1%, when KB/VCR cells were
incubated with 5 μM PPD12 (Figure 3B). These results
indicate that PPD12 inhibits the efflux functions of ABCB1.
To examine whether PPD12 increases the
accumulation of ABCB1 substrates in MDR cancer cells,
we measured intracellular levels of ADM and Rho123
in the presence or absence of PPD12. Representative
confocal images confirmed that PPD12 increases the
accumulation of ADM and Rho123 in KB/VCR and

PPD12 in combination with ABCB1-substrate
chemotherapeutic agents induces apoptosis in
ABCB1-overexpressing cells
We next examined the effects of PPD12 in
combination with chemotherapeutic agents, on cell
apoptosis. Co-treatment with PPD12 and ADM enhanced
apoptosis in comparison with PPD12 or ADM alone
in KB/VCR cells but not in KB cells (Figure 4A). As
shown in Figure 4B, co-treatment with PPD12 and ADM
enhanced both early (Annexin V+/PI−) and late apoptosis
(Annexin V+/PI+) in comparison with PPD12 or ADM
alone in KB/VCR cells These data indicate that PPD12
enhances ADM-induced apoptosis.

Model for binding of PPD12 to ABCB1
We next perforemd docking studies to understand
the binding of PPD12 to ABCB1 at a molecular level,
using the crystal structure of mouse ABCB1 as represented

PPD12 and ADM decreased the tumor growth at an
inhibition ratio of 6.52 and 13.04, respectively (Table 5).
In contrast, co-treatment with PPD12 and ADM inhibited
the growth of KB/VCR xenografts with an inhibition
ratio of 63.04% (Table 5). Moreover, there was no
obvious loss of body weight in the combination group,
suggesting that the combination regimen at the indicated
dose did not cause toxicity in mice (Figure 6C).

TUNEL staining showed that the percentage of positive
cells in KB/VCR xenografts was increased in the
combination group in comparison with ADM alone
or PPD12 alone (Figure 6E). These data indicate that
PPD12 treatment overcomes MDR to ADM in vivo.

Although many clinical trials have been conducted for
specific targets, most results have been disappointing
due to toxicity of the medicines themselves. The use of
traditional herbal medicines has been gaining attention as
an alternative method to overcome these shortcomings, as
such medicines have many biological activities and low
toxicity [32]. Drugs from natural plants have been used
to cure cancer [33–36]. Among such compounds, PPD, an
important metabolite of ginsenoside Rg3, is of particular
interest [37, 38]. PPD has a high degree of anti-cancer
activity, causing inhibition of ABCB1 in tumor cells and
exhibiting extremely low toxicity [39, 40]. We improved
the effectiveness of PPD by preparing a series of PPD
analogues based on an analysis of the structure of ABCB1.
Because the crystal structure of human ABCB1 is
currently unavailable, our docking simulations mainly
relied on the homology model of newly refined mouse
ABCB1. PPD12 is a hydrophobic molecule with a

DISCUSSION
Tumor cell MDR is a complicated and multi-faceted
phenomenon and is the main cause of treatment failure
in cancer chemotherapy [27]. MDR may originate from
several biochemical mechanisms, but the primary cause is
the over-expression of active drug efflux transporters, such
as ABCB1, ABCG2 and ABCC1. These transporters pump
anti-cancer drugs outside of cancer cells, reducing the
efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents [28–30]. To reverse
MDR, there have been numerous attempts to develop
more effective drugs with acceptable tolerance [31].

calculated LogP of 6.1. It also exhibits several aliphatic
ring centers, which are critical for binding at the ABCB1
transporter. The hydrophobic nature of PPD12 may also
contribute to its distribution within the cell membrane,
while ABCB1 normally discharges substrates from the
cellular membrane. Overall, docking simulation is helpful
to provide clues to understand and optimize further PPD
derivatives.
In conclusion, our results show that PPD12
antagonizes ABCB1-mediated cancer cell MDR in vitro
and in vivo by directly blocking the drug-efflux functions
of ABCB1. Our findings advocate the combined use of
PPD12 with ABCB1 substrate anticancer drugs in the
clinic to enhance chemotherapeutic responses.

then added to each well, and the cells were incubated
for 4 h. The colored formazan product was quantified
photometrically at 490 nm in a multi-well plate reader
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The degree
of resistance was estimated by dividing the IC50 for the
MDR cells by that of the parental sensitive cells. Then,
10 μM VRP (inhibitor for ABCB1), 50 μM MK571
(inhibitor for ABCC1) and 2.5 μM FTC (inhibitor for
ABCG2) were used in place of PPD12 as positive controls
to confirm the mechanism of drug resistance in the MDR
cell line models.

Confocal microscopy
Resistant cells were cultured (1 × 104 cells/well)
on sterilized glass cover slips on the day prior to the
assay. Cells were incubated with either 10 μM ADM
alone or 10 μM ADM in the presence of 5 μM PPD12 in
DMEM media for 1 h at 37°C. To examine the Rho123
accumulation, cells were incubated with either 10 μM
Rho123 alone or 10 μM Rho123 in the presence of 10 μM
PPD12 in DMEM media for 1 h at 37°C. The cells were
then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Nuclear staining
was achieved by incubating cells in Hoechst 33342 for
5 min. The cells were then examined under a Confocal
microscope (TCS SP2, Leica, Germany). The data
presented were from one representative experiment of at
least 3 independent repeats.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemical preparation
PPD, PPD11 and PPD12 were synthesized by our
lab as previously reported [25] and prepared as a 100 mM
stock solution in DMSO for in vitro studies. Verapamil
(VRP), Adriamycin (ADM), Rhodamine 123 (Rho123),
cisplatin (CDDP) and other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Cell lines and cell culture
The cell lines utilized were: the human oral
carcinoma cell line KB and its vincristine-selected
ABCB1-overexpressing cell line KB/VCR, human breast
carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and the ADM-resistant,
ABCB1-overexpressing cell line MCF-7/ADM, human
leukemia cell lines HL60 and its doxorubicin-selected
ABCC1-overexpressing derivative HL60/ADM, human
colon carcinoma cell line S1 and its mitoxantrone (MX)selected ABCG2-overexpressing cell line S1-Mi-80,
human primary embryonic kidney cell line HEK293
and its pcDNA3.1-ABCB1 stable-transfected cell line
HEK293/ABCB1 (cultured in medium with 2 mg/ml
G418). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Minimum
Essential Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated
in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Drug-resistant cell lines were periodically cultured in the
respective drug to confirm their resistance.

Adriamycin and Rho 123 accumulation assay
First, cells were treated with PPD12 at various
concentrations at 37°C for 24 h. Then, 10 μM ADM or
10 μM Rho123 was added to the medium and 1-h
incubation was continued, respectively. After that, the
cells were collected, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and
analyzed with flow cytometric (FCM) analysis (Beckman
Coulter, Cytomics FC500, USA). VRP was used as a
positive control inhibitor of ABCB1.

Measurement of the cellular accumulation of
adriamycin
The accumulation of ADM was measured as
described previously [27]. Briefly, KB/VCR and
MCF-7/ADM cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells/well in
96-well plates. The cells were incubated with ADM
at designed concentrations or time in the presence or
absence of PPD12 for 2 h in a CO2 incubator at 37°C.
After incubation, the medium was removed by aspiration,
and the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed
with 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate in PBS. Fluorescence
intensity was measured with a microplate fluorimeter
at emission wavelengths of 485 nm and 590 nm,
respectively. Protein concentrations were measured by
the Lowry method using a Bio-Rad BCA protein assay kit

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was assessed with an MTT assay as
previously described [41]. In brief, cells were seeded
in 96-well micro culture plates for 12 h to allow for
attachment and were then incubated for 72 hours with
various concentrations of PPD derivatives in the presence
or absence of chemotherapeutic agents. MTT was

with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Accumulation
ratios were calculated using the accumulation of ADM in
cells incubated without PPD12 as a control.

The activity of ABCB1 ATPase in response to PPD
derivatives was determined by the Pgp-Glo assay system
(PromegaV3591, Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, according
to the protocol of the manufacturer, the membrane
vesicles (1.25 mg/ml/well) were incubated in different
concentrations of the compound at 37°C for approximately
5 min. The ATPase reaction was initiated by the addition
of Mg-ATP for incubating at 37°C for 30 min. After that,
50 µl of ATP Detection Reagent was added to all wells
for initiating luminescence that is read on a plate-reading
luminometer (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, USA). Verapamil
serves here as a positive control for drug stimulation of
P-gp ATPase activity. A set of Mg-ATP standards at
different concentrations was included in the assay for
plotting a luminescent ATP standard curve and converting
RLUs to specific activity expressed in units of nmoles ATP
consumed/µg Pgp/min.  

ADM efflux studies
ADM efflux was determined following a
modification of methods described previously [26].
Briefly, KB and KB/VCR cells were treated with 5 μM
ADM for 3 h at 37°C. The cells were then washed twice
with ice-cold PBS and subsequently maintained in ADMfree medium at 37°C, in the absence or presence of 5 μM
PPD12. Thereafter, at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, cells
were collected and washed again twice with ice-cold PBS,
and analyzed with flow cytometric analysis.

Apoptosis assay
Cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS,
stained with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI)
in the binding buffer, and detected by FCM after 15 min
incubation at room temperature in the dark. Fluorescence
was measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm
through FL-1 (530 nm) and FL-2 filters (585 nm).
Apoptotic cells were quantified with the FlowJO software.

Experimental animals
Twenty-four male SPF BALB/c nude mice (nu/nu,
aged 5–6 weeks, and weighing approximately 20 g)
were purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal
Center (Shanghai, China) and housed under pathogenfree conditions in the animal care facilities of Ninth
People’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
School of Medicine. Animal welfare and experimental
procedures were in compliance with the Guide for Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals (The Ministry of Science
and Technology of China, 2006) and the related ethical
regulations of the hospital. The Laboratory Animal
Care and Use Committees of the hospital approved all
experimental procedures.
With the KB/VCR cells, the inoculated nude mouse
tumor xenograft model was established. Briefly, KB/VCR
cells (1 × 106) were injected subcutaneously in the right
flank in the nude mice. The mice were randomized into
one of four groups (eight animals in each group) after the
xenograft reached a mean diameter of 0.5 cm, and then
they received various regimens: (a) Control group (0.9%
saline); (b) PPD12 group (biw × 6, p.o., 100 mg/kg);
(c) ADM group (biw × 6, i.p., 5 mg/kg) and (d) PPD12
group (biw × 6, p.o., 50 mg/kg) plus ADM (biw × 6, i.p.,
5 mg/kg). If the xenograft reached a volume of 1000 mm3,
the animal was anaesthetized. Tumor size and animal
weight were monitored every 4 days. Tumor volume
was calculated using the formula: (length × width2/2).
The mice were anaesthetized at the end of the experiment,
and tumor tissue was excised from the mice and weighed.
The rate of inhibition (IR) was calculated according to the
formula:

Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested in SDS lysis buffer (Beyotime,
Haimen, China), and cell lysates were electrophoresed
through 8%–10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred
to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were incubated
with the desired primary antibody for ABCB1 (1:300,
Boster, Wuhan, Hubei, China) and β-actin (1:5000,
Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation
with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature. The immunoreactive bands were visualized
by the Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System (Bioscience,
San Diego, CA, USA). Detection of β-actin was used as a
loading control.

Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Complementary DNA corresponding to 1 μg
of total RNA was used per reaction in a quantitative PCR
reaction performed on an ABI 7300 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) and using Power SYBER Green
Master Mix (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and the following
primers: ABCB1 sense 5′-CCC ATC ATT GCA ATA

TT-3′. Data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCT method and
normalized by β-actin expression in each sample.

Tumor tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde,
dehydrated with gradient ethanol, and embedded in
paraffin. The tissue sections (4 μm) were de-waxed
and rehydrated according to a standard protocol. For
histological analysis, the sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. For the TUNEL assay, an in situ
apoptosis detection kit (Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg,
NJ) was used to detect apoptotic cells. The positive cells
were identified, counted (three random fields per slides),

Docking protocol
The 3D structure of PPD12 was obtained from the
software ChemDraw 7.0. The refined crystal structure of
mouse ABCB1 in complex with QZ59-RRR (PDB ID:
4M2S) and QZ59-SSS (PDB ID: 4M2T) was obtained
from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Docking experiments
were performed with Discovery Studio 3.0. The top
scoring pose-ABCB1-complex was then subjected to
energy minimization and used for graphical analysis.
