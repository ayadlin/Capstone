Abstract
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) evolves due to mutations in the Von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumor
suppressor gene. Although the loss of VHL enables survival and proliferation of CCRCC cells, it is also expected to
introduce vulnerabilities that may be exploited for therapeutics discovery. To this end, we developed a highthroughput screen to identify small molecules derived from plants, microorganisms, and marine organisms to
which CCRCC cells are sensitive. Screening over 8,000 compounds using this approach, we report here the
identification of the microbially derived compound carminomycin I (CA) as an effective inhibitor of VHLdefective (VHL/) CCRCC cell proliferation. CA also induced apoptosis in CCRCC cells by a mechanism
independent of p53 or hypoxia-inducible factor 2. We found that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) sequestered CA within
the Golgi complex. Interestingly, Golgi sequestration was critical for the antiproliferative effects of CA and P-gp
inhibitors abrogated this activity. Furthermore, CA induced cleavage of the Golgi protein p115 and the
translocation of its C-terminal fragment to the nucleus. Finally, examination of the activity of the VHLinteracting Golgi protein, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, ERGIC-53 showed that VHL
could mediate protection from CA in CCRCC cells. Our natural product–based screening approach has revealed
the P-gp–mediated localization of anticancer compounds within the Golgi in CCRCC cells as a potential strategy
of targeting VHL-deficient CCRCC cells. Cancer Res; 71(1); 134–42. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) is the most commonly found form of kidney cancer. It occurs in hereditary and
sporadic forms both of which arise due to structural alterations in the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) gene (1, 2). The most
studied function of the VHL gene product (pVHL) is the
regulation of levels of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-a
family of transcription factors (3). However, the increasing
number of proteins with which it interacts as well as genotype–phenotype correlations in VHL disease all strongly suggest that pVHL possesses functions unrelated to HIF that may
contribute to the genesis and progression of CCRCC. How
HIF-independent functions contribute to tumor development
after pVHL inactivation, however, remains unclear. Elucida-

tion of these functions should lead to enhanced understanding
of renal carcinogenesis and should enable the identification of
novel targets that may be exploited in therapeutic discovery.
Natural products (i.e., plant, microbial, and marine organism–
derived compounds) have in the past proved a fertile source
of bioactive compounds that have led to both the development of newer chemotherapeutic interventions and a better
understanding of the underlying disease biology. In the area
of anticancer compounds, natural products either represent
actual drugs (such as Taxol, vincristine, and camptothecin)
or have served as the basis for the development of a large
number of currently clinically approved drugs. We, therefore, set out to address the challenges of identifying small
molecules selectively targeting VHL/ CCRCC cells using
a forward chemical genetics approach employing natural
product–based high-throughput screening (HTS).

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture
The 786-O cell line was obtained from the repository of the
Developmental Therapeutics Program at the National Cancer
Institute. The cell lines UOK-121 and UOK-127 were obtained
from the National Cancer Institute Urologic Oncology Branch
Renal Cell Carcinoma Cell Line Repository. The cell lines have
been characterized at the repositories using, among others,
single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and by oligonucleotide-base HLA typing. They have also been subjected
to spectral karyotyping and have been characterized for

variations in short tandem repeats (4, 5). All cell lines were
placed under cryostorage after they were acquired from the
repositories and used within 6 months of thawing fresh vials.
Routinely, cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2.
Stably transduced 786-OVHL, UOK-121VHL, and UOK127VHL as well 786-O, UOK-121, and UOK-127 cell lines were
generated using retroviral gene delivery with or without VHL
as described previously (6). During this time, cell morphology,
growth curve, and possible mycoplasma contamination were
regularly checked to ensure the absence of contamination.
High-throughput screening
During the screening campaign, 5,000 cells of both 786-O
and 786-OVHL cell lines were plated per well in different 384well plates and the plates were incubated overnight. After this
period, test compounds were added at a final concentration of
10 mmol/L. Reduction of 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) by metabolically active cells to a colored product was used to assess
the effect of compounds on cells after 24 hours. A total of 8,326
compounds were tested using this screening assay.
Analysis of cell death
Cells were treated with serial dilutions of either the vehicle
control or hit compounds in a dose–response format and were
incubated for 24 hours. Cell viability was assessed using the
above XTT assay. Caspase activity in treated cells was determined using Caspase-Glo 3/7, 8, and 9 assays according to the
manufacturer's instructions in 384-well plates (Promega).
Lactate dehydrogenase release from necrotic cells into the
extracellular fluid was determined using the CytoTox-ONE
membrane integrity assay kit following the manufacturer's
protocol (Promega).
Western blotting
After compound treatment, cells were trypsinized, neutralized, and pelleted. Cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold
PBS. Pellets were then lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer (Sigma)
containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1 tablet per
5 mL of lysis buffer and 1.02 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride. Total protein concentration was determined using a
BCA kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as the
standard. Cellular protein (10–50 mg) was resolved by SDSPAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were
blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor) overnight at
4 C and then incubated with specific primary antibodies. All
antibodies except the following were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology and used at 1:200 to 1:1,000 dilutions: VHL,
PARP [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase], cleaved PARP (Cell
Signaling); a1-antitrypsin (A1AT), Bak (Abcam); and a-tubulin
and b-actin (Sigma). GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase), b-actin, or a-tubulin was used as a loading
control and changes in protein levels shown were found to be
significant relative to loading controls. Following incubation
with primary antibody, membranes were washed and incubated with antimouse IRDye 680 and antirabbit IRDye 800

secondary antibodies (Li-Cor). Blots were scanned using an
Odyssey infrared imaging system and processed using its
software (Li-Cor). Band intensities were determined using
the Odyssey band quantitation software after background
subtraction using the median top-bottom method. Intensities
of bands of interest were normalized to the signals from the
corresponding loading control bands.
Cell-cycle analysis
Following treatment with 0.1 mmol/L of carminomycin I
(CA) for 16 hours, 0.5 to 1.0  106/mL live 786-O and 786-OVHL
cells were harvested and stained with propidium iodide using
Krishan's buffer (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.02 mg/mL RNase A,
0.3% NP-40 and 50 mg/mL propidium iodide) at a pH of 7.4.
RNA interference and quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR
HIF-2a targeted siRNA and control siRNA-termed mock
were kind gifts from Dr. Olga Aprelikova of the Laboratory of
Tumor and Stem Cell Biology at the National Cancer Institute
and have been described previously. The sequence for the HIF2 siRNA used was 50 -GGUGUGCUGUUUGGAGUUCdTdT-30 . A
control siRNA-termed mock (target sequence 50 GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG-30 ) was purchased from Qiagen
and had no significant homology to any known human
sequence. The 786-O cells (1–2  105/well) were transfected
with siRNA oligos (30–60 nmol/L final concentration) in 6-well
plates, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours later, the transfected
RCC cells were washed and used for subsequent experiments.
Transduction of 786-O cells via lentiviral P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
shRNA was carried out using commercially available lentiviral
supernatants (Santa Cruz) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was extracted and purified using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen), and 2 mg total RNA was reverse transcribed
using ImProm-II reverse transcription reagent (Promega).
Primers and probes for human P-gp, HIF-2a, A1AT, and
b-actin were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Assayson-demand).
P-gp ATPase assay
The assay was performed using the Pgp-Glo Assay kit
(Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol.
a1-Antitrypsin ELISA
Cells were grown in T25-flasks to 80% confluence, and
conditioned cell culture medium was harvested after 24 hours.
For ELISA, 100 mL of undiluted conditioned medium was used.
ELISA was conducted according to manufacturer's instructions (Alpco).
Immunocytochemistry
Cells grown on cover slips or seeded on glass chips with an
O- or L-shaped fibronectin micropattern (Cytoo) were fixed
with 4% fresh paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with
either 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS or cold methanol. Samples
were blocked using Odessey blocking buffer overnight at 4 C.

compartment (ERGIC)-53 (1:1,000, Alexis), anti-P-gp (1:100,
Santa Cruz or 1:100 Abcam), and anti-GM130 (1:100, Epitomics) monoclonal antibodies were incubated with samples
overnight at 4 C. Finally, the samples were washed and
incubated for 45 minutes with the appropriate secondary
antibody from among the following: Alexa Fluor 488 goat
antirabbit; Alexa Fluor 488 chicken antigoat, and/or Alexa
Fluor 594 goat antimouse (Invitrogen). Counterstaining was
performed where shown using ProLong Gold antifade reagent
with DAPI (Invitrogen) as the mounting medium. In some
double-labeled experiments, 786-O cells were first transduced
with Organelle Lights Golgi-RFP (Invitrogen) as a marker for
the Golgi. Images were acquired using Zeiss LSM 510 microscopes at 63 magnifications (Zeiss).
Image analysis
Images were processed with the program ImageJ (http://
www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/facilities/wcif/imagej/). Quantitative analysis of colocalization was performed using the plugin
"colocalization threshold" of ImageJ. Details of the image
analysis protocol can be found in the Supplementary Data.

Results
High-throughput screen
To identify small molecule inhibitors of VHL/cell proliferation, an HTS assay was developed using the paired cell
lines 786-O and 786-OVHL run in parallel in separate 384well plates. The CCRCC cell line 786-O was selected for assay
development on the basis of its properties such as tolerance
to up to 3% DMSO, a doubling time of about 24 hours in
microplates, compatibility with automation in cell plating
and liquid handling, as well as ABC transporter profile.
VHLþ/þ 786-O cells (786-OVHL) were then generated by
transduction using a VHL expression construct. Expression
of pVHL in stably transduced cells was confirmed by
Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similarly, other
VHLþ/þ cell lines were also generated using the VHL/
CCRCC cell lines UOK-121 and UOK-127. Consistency and
reproducibility of the HTS assay were assessed using a set of
352 compounds as a validation library. A very high correlation coefficient (0.954; R2 ¼ 0.890.91) was obtained from 3
independent experiments. In addition, how well the assay
performed during the screen was also routinely evaluated via
determination of the Z-factor (7). The Z-factor determined
during the screen for all plates with 786-O cells using
actinomycin D at 10 mmol/L as the positive control and
1% DMSO as the negative control was found to be 0.68 
0.082 indicating that the assay performed well during HTS.
In the primary screen, 56 compounds inhibited cell proliferation by more than 2-fold in 786-O cells compared with
that in 786-OVHL cells with these compounds also showing
at least 50% inhibition in 786-O cells.
Hit compounds identified in the primary screen were
serially diluted and subjected to retesting in a dose–
response format. Of the 56 compounds identified as hits
in the primary screen, 15 were found to show attenuation of

136

Cancer Res; 71(1) January 1, 2011

cell proliferation in 786-O cells in a dose-dependent manner.
To enable a broader evaluation of effect of hit compounds
on VHL/ cell proliferation, hits were also evaluated in
paired VHLþ/þ and VHL/ UOK-121 and UOK-127 cells.
All 15 hit compounds tested also showed differential inhibition of cell proliferation in paired UOK-121 and UOK121VHL cells as well as in UOK-127 and UOK-127VHL cells
(Fig. 1). Because of its fluorescent nature, we chose one of
the hit compounds, CA, as a model to illustrate the utility of
natural products in providing a novel perspective on targeting cancer cells in general and CCRCC cells in particular.
Below, we present our findings from the follow-up work
done using CA.
CA induces apoptosis in 786-O cells
The most studied function of pVHL is the negative regulation of HIF via ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Therefore, we
examined whether the observed cytotoxicity in 786-O cells was
HIF mediated and whether the observed resistance to CA in
786-OVHL cells was dependent on HIF downregulation. We
found, however, that CA exerts its effects on 786-O cells
through HIF independent mechanisms (Supplementary
Fig. S2). The absence of lactate dehydrogenase release into
the growth medium and the lack of vesicles that stained
positive for beclin-1, Atg12, or LC3B also allowed the determination that CA did not curtail the viability of 786-O cells
through either necrosis or autophagy. Measurement of caspase activity over a 24-hour period after CA treatment, on the
other hand, revealed increased caspase-3 activity as early as 2
hours after treatment. More pronounced differential caspase3 activity between 786-O and 786-OVHL cells became apparent after 24 hours at all CA concentrations tested 0.1 to 100
mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Significant differential caspase-8, and to a lesser extent caspase-9, activity in 786-O and
786-OVHL cells was observable only 24 hours after treatment
at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mmol/L (Supplementary
Fig. 3). This suggested that apoptosis mediated by caspase-3
activation may contribute to the observed effect of CA on cell
proliferation. Caspase-3 activation at lower CA test concentrations also appears not to directly correlate with activation
of either caspase-8 or -9 suggesting that an alternative initiation pathway may play a role.
Real-time monitoring of effects of CA treatment on 786-O
cells led to the observation of blebbing and changes to the cell
membrane characteristic of apoptosis (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Genomic DNA extracted from CA-treated 786-O
cells also exhibited characteristic internucleosomal laddering
of genomic DNA fragments in agarose gel electrophoresis
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). Induction of apoptosis by CA in
786-O cells was further supported through monitoring PARP
and caspase-3 cleavage as well as through changes in the levels
of a panel of proteins commonly involved in apoptotic signaling via Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Finally, treatment of 786-O
cells with the pan caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk or Boc-D-fmk
resulted in reversal of effects of CA on cell proliferation
(Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results indicate that CA
curtailed proliferation of 786-O cells through induction of
apoptosis.

CA induces survivin and p53 downregulation in 786-O
cells
Resistance to cytokine-induced apoptosis in the 786-O cell
line has been attributed to expression of high levels of

www.aacrjournals.org

apoptosis-inhibiting molecules (8). We thus examined the
effect of CA on the levels of expression of the inhibitor of
apoptosis protein survivin. Western blotting of lysates from
CA-treated cells revealed a decrease in survivin levels in 786-O
cells, whereas its levels in 786-OVHL cells increased suggesting
that CA owes its apoptotic effects in 786-O cells, in part, to its
effects on survivin (Fig. 3). The activation of caspase-2 has
been reported to repress the transcription of the survivin (9).
Western blotting also revealed that CA treatment enhanced
capsase-2 cleavage (Fig. 3A). Next, because upregulation of
survivin in malignant cells has also been associated with
accelerated S-phase shift, resistance to G1 arrest, and activation of Cdk2/cyclin E complex leading to Rb-phosphorylation
(10), we looked at effects of CA on the cell cycle and cell-cycle
checkpoint signaling pathway proteins. First, the distribution
of live 786-O cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined using flow cytometry following incubation with CA.
The number of 786-O cells in S-phase significantly increased
consistent with S-phase arrest (Fig. 3C). We also found that CA
treatment in 786-O cells was accompanied by a decrease in the
levels of phosphorylated Rb and an increase in levels of cyclins
D3 and E with no significant change in Cdk2 levels (Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly, cyclin D3 is known to induce
the activation of caspase-2 (11) suggesting that caspase-2
mediated proapoptotic mitochondrial effects and downregulation of survivin both play a role in mediating the effects of
CA on proliferation of 786-O cells.
To better understand the molecular mechanisms that result
in the differential activity seen between 786-O and 786-OVHL
cells in response to CA treatment, we also examined the role of
factors commonly involved in regulating apoptotic response.
Activation of p53 has been shown to induce apoptosis in 786-O
cells treated with either indomethacin (12) or UV-radiation
(13). As a result, we first examined changes in p53 levels as well
as changes in the levels of p53 downstream targets in both
786-O and 786-OVHL cells following CA treatment. Western
blotting of 786-O protein lysates from treated cells showed
that p53 levels in fact decreased in response to CA in 786-O
cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, p53 levels in 786-OVHL cells
increased in response to CA. We also looked at changes in
the level of p53 targets such as p21 and p27. Both p21 and p27
levels decreased in response to treatment with CA in 786-O
cells, suggesting that apoptosis may not be mediated through
activation of the p53 pathway in 786-O cells.
Sensitivity to CA in 786-O cells is mediated through its
active localization within the Golgi
Resistance to anthracycline compounds like CA is known to
be mediated by the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily of membrane proteins. More pertinently, sequestration
of the CA-related anthracycline daunorubicin within intracellular organelles has been reported to be mediated by P-gp (14).
We, therefore, first looked at whether CA potentially was a
substrate for P-gp. The results showed that CA stimulated
basal P-gp ATPase activity by more than 4-fold suggesting that
it is a substrate for transport by P-gp like other anthracycline
antibiotics (Fig. 4A). Because P-gp–mediated resistance to the
anthracycline doxorubicin in OVCAR-3 cells is reversible by

other P-gp substrates, we looked at whether this resistance
could also be reversed by CA. Pretreatment of OVCAR-3 cells
with 0.1 mmol/L CA resulted in an enhanced sensitivity to
doxorubicin compared with pretreatement with the P-gp
inhibitors verapamil or cyclosporin A (Fig. 4B). Next, 786-O
cells were pretreated with verapamil at 50 mmol/L for 30
minutes and then incubated with varying concentrations of
CA. It was found that 786-O cells became resistant to CA
(Fig. 4C). To further confirm involvement of P-gp, siRNA was
used to knockdown P-gp in 786-O cells (786-O Pgp-KD).
Compared with 786-O cells treated with a GFP control siRNA,
786-O Pgp-KD cells displayed increased resistance to CA
(Fig. 4C).
We then examined whether CA, like the anthracycline
and P-gp substrate daunorubicin, was also sequestered within
786-O cells. Because CA is a fluorescent compound, we used
confocal fluorescence microscopy of CA-treated 786-O cells
and determined that, like daunorubicin (Fig. 4D), CA localized
within the perinuclear region in vesicles (Fig. 4E). This observation appears to exclude the known nuclear effect on DNA of
anthracyclines as a potential mechanism of cytotoxicity (15).
Because the perinuclear distribution of CA appeared consistent with localization in either the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) or the Golgi, 786-O cells transfected with either a Golgilocalizing RFP (786-O Golgi-RFP) or ER-localizing dsRed
reporter (786-O ER-dsRed) were generated to enable a comparison of the localization pattern of CA in 786-O cells.
Comparison of the fluorescence images of 786-O Golgi-RFP,
786-O ER-dsRed, and 786-O cells treated with CA suggested
that CA might localize in the Golgi. Further support for this
was obtained from colocalization studies done in 786-O GolgiRFP cells using quantitative analysis of confocal images that
revealed significant colocalization. The analysis showed that

CA signals were within the Golgi and 54%  0.1% of the Golgi
compartment showed CA signals (n ¼ 30). Similarly, to
confirm the presence of P-gp in the Golgi, we also carried
out a colocalization experiment using P-gp immunofluorescence while using GM130 as a Golgi marker in fixed 786-O cells
grown on glass cover slips. Here, 46%  13% (median  MAD)
of P-gp signals were found within the Golgi and 67%  9% of
the Golgi compartment showed P-gp signal (n ¼ 30) indicating
a significant P-gp presence in the Golgi (Fig. 4F). The 786-O
cells grown on O- and L-shaped fibronectin micropatterns on
glass chips (Supplementary Fig. S5) to normalize cell position,
shape, polarity, and internal organelle positioning also confirmed the presence of P-gp in the Golgi in addition to the cell
membrane (16).
CA induces p115 cleavage
Because CA is sequestered within the Golgi, we next investigated whether effects on Golgi proteins played a role in its
proapoptotic activity. Cleavage and import into the nucleus of
the C-terminus of the Golgi protein p115 have been shown
to promote apoptosis (17). Western blotting and immunofluorescence examination employing an antibody that recognizes
the C-terminus of p115 in CA-treated 786-O cells showed that this
fragment was detectable in the nucleus of 786-O cells, whereas
none was seen in the nucleus of untreated controls (Fig. 5).
CA modulates ERGIC-53 activity
To better understand the differential response to CA treatment seen between 786-O and 786-OVHL cells, we asked
whether the interaction of Golgi proteins with pVHL afforded
786-OVHL cells protection from the effects of CA. One of the
well-studied Golgi proteins known to interact with pVHL is
the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment protein ERGIC-53
(also known as LMAN1) that constitutively cycles between the

ER, ERGIC, and the cis-Golgi elements (18). CA treatment
produced no significant changes in ERGIC-53 levels in both
786-O and 786-OVHL cells (Fig. 6A). We, therefore, looked into
whether its anterograde and retrograde trafficking was
impacted by CA treatment in 786-O cells and whether pVHL
afforded protection from effects of CA on its trafficking.
Immunofluorescence confocal experiments revealed that its
trafficking was impacted in 786-O cells and showed significantly decreased characteristic accumulation in ERGIC and
cis-Golgi elements that is seen in untreated cells (Fig. 6B). No
such disruption was evident in CA-treated 786-OVHL cells. We
then looked at export of a well-known ERGIC-53 client protein, A1AT, as a way to assess impact of CA on ERGIC-53
activity (19). Western blotting revealed that intracellular A1AT
levels increased in CA-treated 786-O cells indicating that A1AT
was increasingly being retained within treated cells while its
levels remained unchanged in treated 786-OVHL cells
(Fig. 6A). We also compared A1AT-secretion from 786-O
and 786-OVHL cells after treatment with CA. Conditioned
medium from CA or DMSO control-treated 786-O and 786OVHL cells was examined using an A1AT-specific ELISA. A
3.3-fold increase in secreted A1AT levels was measured in 786O cells relative to untreated controls (5.01 mg/L/1,000 cells),
whereas a 6.2-fold increase was observed in 786-OVHL cells
relative to control cells (15.52 mg/L/1,000 cells; Fig. 6C).

The main goal of the work presented above is the demonstration of the utility of a natural product–based screening
approach as a viable strategy for exploring newer ways of
targeting CCRCC. To date, other than the modulation of HIF-2
activity, there have not been many viable molecular targets
proposed for therapeutic discovery in CCRCC. In this regard,
we discovered a compound that exploits other vulnerabilities
created by genetic and epigenetic alterations that have taken
place in CCRCC. The screen employed an unbiased cell-based
assay that has led to the identification of CA as a selective
inhibitor of CCRCC cell proliferation.
The similarity in the rate of change in XTT reduction of CAtreated paired VHL/ and VHLþ/þ cells reveals that
although CA impacts cell viability to a significant extent in
VHL/ cells, it did not impact the rate of change in viability
to a similar extent compared with VHLþ/þ cells. This suggests
that the presence of pVHL impacts sensitivity to CA but not
the rate of change in cell viability. We found that CA induced
apoptosis in VHL/ cells to a significant extent and that this
activity was HIF and p53 independent. At low concentrations,
CA induced the activation of caspases-2 and -3 with little or no
effect on the activation of caspases-8 or -9. This effect was
accompanied by downregulation of the inhibitor of apoptosis
protein survivin, a caspase-2 target. Although survivin levels
appear to be steady at the 8-hour time point while the level of
caspase-2 is increasing in response to CA treatment, this does
not necessarily imply that caspase-2 activation does not
contribute to survivin downregulation. In fact, stress response
to anthracyclines is known to result in the rapid induction of
both mRNA and protein of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins

Figure 4. CA is sequestered within the Golgi. A, CA stimulates P-gp ATPase activity. The difference in luminescence between 100 mmol/L Na3VO4– treated
and DMSO (control)-treated P-gp in cell membrane fractions constituted basal activity. The decrease in luminescence as a result of CA treatment
compared with Na3VO4 treatment represents CA-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity. Determination of unconsumed ATP after stopping P-gp ATPase
activity was made using luciferase and luminescence measured is presented in relative light units (RLU). Verapamil was used as a positive control. Results
shown are averages of 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate  SEM. B, resistance to doxorubicin (DxR) in the P-gp expressing cell line
OVCAR-3 is significantly reversed via cotreatment with CA (0.1 mmol/L) compared with the P-gp inhibitors verapamil (Vp, 50 mmol/L) and cyclosporin

explained through its effects on p115 (21). Although CA had no
effects on levels of the Golgi protein ERGIC-53, which is one of
the few Golgi proteins known to have a direct protein–protein
interaction with pVHL, it impacted its distribution pattern
between the ER and the Golgi. Our results also indicated that
the secretion into the growth medium of A1AT, an ERGIC-53
client, was attenuated while intracellular A1AT levels
increased in response to CA treatment. These are consistent
with attenuation of function of ERGIC-53 (22).
CA is composed of an aglycone moiety and a monosaccharide residue. Because microsomes from mammalian tissues are
known to metabolize anthracyclines to the superoxide anion
of the aglycones and their monosaccharide residues through
reductive glycosidic cleavage, it can be hypothesized that

including survivin that is followed by a gradual decrease of
their expression (20). We also determined that CA was
sequestered within the Golgi in CCRCC cells and that mediation by P-gp, which was also found within the Golgi, was
required for its activity. However, whether CA is also sequestered within the Golgi of other P-gp expressing cell lines awaits
further investigation. Its localization within the Golgi in
CCRCC cells suggests that it might exert its action, at least
in part, through effects on Golgi proteins. We, therefore,
explored effects of CA on Golgi proteins and whether resistance to CA in VHLþ/þ CCRCC cells was related to interaction
of pVHL with Golgi proteins. We found that CA treatment
resulted in the detection of the C-terminal fragment of p115 in
the nucleus indicating that its apoptotic effects can in part be

damage to Golgi proteins by the reactive oxygen species
formed from the aglycone may be responsible for the effects
of CA on proliferation in CCRCC cells (23–25). Alternatively,
recognition of the monosaccharide residue in CA as a substrate may lead to attenuation of activity of Golgi proteins.
Undoubtedly, however, CA also affects its activity through
impact on additional pathways and targets. Demonstration of
efficacy in xenograft models is pending preparative scale
isolation of CA from the producing microorganism.
In summary, our findings illustrate a potential novel
approach for targeting VHL/ clear cell renal carcinoma.
Our findings also underscore the utility of natural products in
yielding compounds that may be used either in therapeutic
development or as bioprobes.
