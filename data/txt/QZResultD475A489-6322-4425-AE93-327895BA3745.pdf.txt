are uncommon in most sporadically occurring cancers. A notable
exception is non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in which somatic
LKB1 inactivation is estimated to occur in 30% to 50% of
sporadically occurring lung adenocarcinomas (1–4). More recently,
LKB1 mutations have also been described in f20% of squamous
cell carcinomas and f10% of large cell carcinomas of the lung (4).
Because 212,000 cases of lung cancer are projected to be diagnosed
in the U.S. in 2007 and 87% of lung cancer cases are NSCLC, it is
therefore possible that >80,000 NSCLC patients will have tumors
that bear LKB1 mutations (5).
LKB1 activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) when the
intracellular AMP/ATP ratio is increased (6–9). AMPK is a
heterotrimeric protein composed of a-catalytic, and h- and
g-regulatory subunits. Conditions that deplete intracellular energy
activate AMPK by direct binding of AMP to four tandem repeats of
cystathionine-h synthase sequences located in the g (regulatory)
subunit (10). Although AMP binding does not seem to directly
promote LKB1 phosphorylation of T172 in the activation loop, it
blocks dephosphorylation and inactivation by phosphatase PP2C
(11). Phosphorylation at this site is required for the activation of
AMPK.
The LKB1/AMPK pathway is linked to tumor growth and
proliferation through regulation of the mTOR pathway. AMPK
inhibits mTOR by directly phosphorylating the tumor suppressor
TSC2 at S1227 and S1345, which causes its activation. TSC2 is a
component of a complex that negatively regulates mTOR (12–14).
TSC2 is also regulated by the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which
phosphorylates TSC2 at T1462, leading to its inactivation (15).
Importantly, regulation of TSC2 by AMPK is independent of Akt
activation, which is the best-described stimulus for mTOR
activation. mTOR is a bona fide target in cancer treatment and
prevention because it regulates cellular growth and protein
synthesis through downstream targets such as 4E-BP1, S6K, and
S6 (reviewed in ref. 16). Based on its regulation of mTOR, activation
of the LKB1/AMPK pathway could be a mechanism to prevent the
formation and progression of cancer, and AMPK activators may
have potential as anticancer agents. Despite the potentially strong
rationale to target AMPK in LKB1-mutant cancers, this approach
has not been tested because no compounds have been identified
that can activate AMPK independently of LKB1 in vivo.
Phosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues (PIAs) were designed
to target the pleckstrin homology domain of the serine/threonine
kinase, Akt. Screening of these compounds in cancer cell lines
showed that 5 of 25 analogues inhibited Akt and preferentially
induced apoptosis in cancer cell lines with high levels of
endogenous Akt activity (17). When these compounds were
screened in the NCI-60 cell line panel, cytotoxicity correlated with

Abstract
Loss of function of the tumor suppressor LKB1 occurs in 30%
to 50% of lung adenocarcinomas. Because LKB1 activates
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which can negatively
regulate mTOR, AMPK activation might be desirable for
cancer therapy. However, no known compounds activate
AMPK independently of LKB1 in vivo, and the usefulness of
activating AMPK in LKB1-mutant cancers is unknown. Here,
we show that lipid-based Akt inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol
ether lipid analogues (PIA), activate AMPK independently of
LKB1. PIAs activated AMPK in LKB1-mutant non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with similar concentration
dependence as that required to inhibit Akt. However, AMPK
activation was independent of Akt inhibition. AMPK activation was a major mechanism of mTOR inhibition. To assess
whether another kinase capable of activating AMPK,
CaMKKB, contributed to PIA-induced AMPK activation, we
used an inhibitor of CaMKK, STO-609. STO-609 inhibited
PIA-induced AMPK activation in LKB1-mutant NSCLC cells,
and delayed AMPK activation in wild-type LKB1 NSCLC cells.
In addition, AMPK activation was not observed in NSCLC
cells with mutant CaMKKB, suggesting that CaMKKB contributes to PIA-induced AMPK activation in cells. AMPK
activation promoted PIA-induced cytotoxicity because PIAs
were less cytotoxic in AMPKA /
murine embryonic
fibroblasts or LKB1-mutant NSCLC cells transfected with
mutant AMPK. This mechanism was also relevant in vivo.
Treatment of LKB1-mutant NSCLC xenografts with PIA
decreased tumor volume by f50% and activated AMPK.
These studies show that PIAs recapitulate the activity of two
tumor suppressors (PTEN and LKB1) that converge on
mTOR. Moreover, they suggest that PIAs might have utility
in the treatment of LKB1-mutant lung adenocarcinomas.

Introduction
LKB1, or serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11), is a tumor
suppressor gene located on the short arm of chromosome 19 (1).
Germ line mutations of LKB1 occur in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome,
which is characterized by intestinal hamartomas and an increased
predisposition to many types of cancer. However, LKB1 mutations

PIAs activate AMPK
Pharmacologic treatments. Cells were plated at a density of 4  105
cells per well in six-well plates in RPMI containing 5% FBS and incubated
for 24 h. The medium was then changed to RPMI with 0.1% FBS just prior
to pharmacologic treatment. Cells were treated with 10 Amol/L of PIAs
dissolved in DMSO for the indicated time periods. For experiments
involving pretreatment of cells with kinase inhibitors, the medium was
changed to 0.1% RPMI and cells were treated with LY294002 or SB203580
dissolved in DMSO or STO-609 dissolved in 50% DMSO and 100 mmol/L of
NaOH, prior to treatment with PIA5. In all experiments, vehicle was added
to control samples and had no effect on kinase phosphorylation or activity.
After incubation with PIAs, the cells were harvested for immunoblot
analysis or for analysis of total cell death or apoptosis, as described below.
Immunoblotting. Cell extracts were prepared by adding 2 Laemmli
sample buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail as described
previously (25). Lysates were sonicated for 15 s with a Vibra Cell sonicator.
The protein yield was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay
kit. Equivalent protein was loaded and the lysates were separated by SDSPAGE and then transferred to 0.45-Am nitrocellulose membranes. Equivalent
loading was confirmed by staining membranes with fast green as previously
described (26). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer
(1 TBS, 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20) and placed in primary antibody (1 TBS,
5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 1:1,000 antibody) overnight at
4jC. Primary antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase–linked
goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Cell Signaling) and
visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce
Super Signal). Immunoblot experiments were performed at least thrice.
Densitometry was performed using NIH Image software.
PIA treatment of H157 and PC3 xenografts. H157 LKB1-mutant
NSCLC cells and PC3 prostate cancer cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI + 5% FBS. Male
6-week-old athymic nude mice (athymic NCr-nu/nu) were inoculated s.c.
with 1  107 H157 cells (efficacy study) or PC3 cells (biomarker study) in
each rear flank. When tumors reached 200 mm2 (day 15 post-tumor
implant), the mice were randomized into vehicle (n = 12 for H157 xenograft
study or n = 3 for PC3 xenograft study) and PIA-treated (n = 12 or 3) groups.
PIAs were dissolved in a vehicle of 10% DMSO in saline/Tween 80. The mice
received i.p. injections of vehicle, 90 mg/kg of PIA5 qd 5 (efficacy study), or
40 mg/kg of PIA23 every 8 h 3 (biomarker study). Four hours after the last
dose, three mice from each group were sacrificed, and tumors were fixed in
10% formalin for immunohistochemical analysis of AMPK activation. For
immunoblotting, tumor lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Immunoblots
were performed as described above. For the efficacy study, tumor volume
was measured on days 1, 3, 5, and 9 of the study. Data points represent the
median tumor volume F SE.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed on
tumors harvested from three of the vehicle-treated mice from each
xenograft study and three of the mice treated with PIA5 or PIA23. Tumors
were paraffin-imbedded, sectioned, and placed on slides (Histoserv, Inc.).
Antigen retrieval was performed in target retrieval solution (DakoCytomation California, Inc.). P-AMPK antibody (Cell Signaling) was used at a
dilution of 1:50. To verify the specificity of staining, one tissue section was
incubated in a solution containing P-AMPK antibody in the presence of a
1:10 dilution of blocking peptide obtained from Cell Signaling. Detection
was performed by standard avidin-biotin complex methods. Immunohistochemistry was quantified by assigning a score of absent (0), minimal (1),
moderate (2), or high (3) staining to each cell in three 40 magnification
fields. The staining index was then calculated by multiplying the staining
intensity by its distribution. An overall score was assigned to each slide, and
the scores were averaged for vehicle versus PIA23-treated groups.
Cell death assays. Cells were treated with PIAs for 12 h as described
above. Floating cells were collected, and adherent cells were harvested by
trypsinization and then centrifuged at 1,000  g for 5 min. Cells were
incubated with 1 Ag/mL of propidium iodide. Cell uptake of propidium
iodide was quantified using a Becton Dickinson FACsort and by manual
gating using CellQuest software. Cell death experiments were performed in
triplicate and were repeated at least thrice.

levels of phosphorylated Akt but not total Akt, but other molecular
markers were also identified that had higher correlations with
activity (18). In addition, these studies showed that PIAs induced
more apoptosis than other pathway inhibitors despite similar levels
of Akt inhibition, which suggested that other targets of PIAs might
contribute to the cytotoxicity of these compounds. To assess effects
on other kinases, we screened the 5 active PIAs against 29 purified
kinases and showed that although no kinase was uniformly
inhibited by the five active PIAs, two kinases were uniformly
activated, p38a and AMPK (19). Subsequently, we characterized the
mechanism of activation of p38 by PIAs and showed that p38
activation contributed to PIA-induced cytotoxicity (19). However,
because a portion of cytotoxicity was still independent of p38 and
Akt, and AMPK is an emerging target in cancer, we therefore
investigated the role of AMPK in the cellular response to PIAs.
We report that PIAs induce the phosphorylation and activation
of AMPK in lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by a mechanism
that is independent of LKB1. Activation of AMPK was also
independent of other previously described activities of PIAs
(inhibition of Akt and activation of p38a), but was dependent on
an upstream kinase of AMPK, CaMKKh. Because AMPK activation
contributes to PIA cytotoxicity, our data suggest that PIAs could
potentially fulfill a unique therapeutic niche in treating NSCLC
patients whose tumors bear LKB1 mutations.

Materials and Methods
Materials. The synthesis of PIAs has previously been described (20).
P-AMPK (T172) monoclonal antibody, pan-AMPKa, P-ACC (S79), P-p38
(T180/Y182), P-hsp27 (S82), P-Akt (S473), P-GSK3a/h (S21/9), and P-S6K
(S389) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. LKB1 antibody
was purchased from Upstate. STO-609, SB203580, and LY294002, were
purchased from Calbiochem. Protease inhibitor cocktail was obtained from
Sigma Chemical Co., and protein assay materials were from Pierce. Wildtype (wt) LKB1 cDNA and AMPK dominant-negative K(45)R plasmids were
generously provided by Dr. Tomi Makela (University of Helsinki, Helsinki,
Finland) and Dr. Craig Thompson (Abramson Family Cancer Research
Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), respectively, and
have been previously described (1, 21).
Cell culture. The NSCLC cell lines A549 and H460 both contain a point
mutation in codon 37 (Gln to stop) of the LKB1 gene, as previously
described (3). The H157 NSCLC cell line contains a 1.5 kb deletion spanning
exons 2 and 3 (kinase domain) of the LKB1 gene (22). The H1155 NSCLC cell
line contains wt LKB1 (3). All NSCLC cell lines were established at NCI/Navy
Medical Oncology. The prostate cancer cell line PC3 was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. The isogenic wt and p38a / murine
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were a kind gift from Dr. Michael Karin
(University of California, San Diego, CA). The immortalized isogenic wt
and LKB1 / MEFs were established by Dr. Tomi Makela (University of
Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland). The lung cancer cell line H1770 contains a
missense mutation (P127L) in the CaMMKb gene, as previously described
(23). The immortalized isogenic AMPKa wt and / MEFs were created by
Dr. Keith Laderoute and are described in ref. (24). All cell lines were
maintained in 175 cm2 flasks in RPMI and supplemented with 5% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of
streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37jC in a 5.0% CO2 atmosphere.
Transient transfections. Cells (1  106) were nucleofected with 4 Ag of
LKB1-wt cDNA construct, AMPK DN construct, or vector using nucleofector
technology (Amaxa). Following nucleofection, 4  105 cells/well were plated
in six-well plates in RPMI + 5% FBS. Cells were treated 24 h posttransfection.
Glucose depletion study. Cells were plated at a density of 4  105 cells
per well in six-well plates in RPMI containing 5% FBS and incubated for
24 h. The medium was then changed to RPMI containing 5% FBS with or
without 25 mmol/L of glucose. Cells were incubated under these conditions
for 2 h and were harvested for immunoblot analysis as described below.

Apoptosis assays. Cells were treated with PIAs for 12 h and collected as
described above. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% methanol added dropwise,
and then incubated at 20jC for 30 min. Cells were centrifuged and
incubated with propidium iodide (25 Ag/mL) supplemented with RNase A
(30 Ag/mL) for 30 min at room temperature. Quantification of sub-2N DNA
was determined by flow cytometry. Apoptosis experiments were performed
in triplicate and were repeated at least thrice.

H157, A549, and H460 cells and present in H1155 and PC3 cells,
consistent with their mutational status (Fig. 1A, left). To determine
if AMPK could be activated in response to a normal stimulus
(glucose depletion), H1155 and H157 cells were incubated in the
absence of glucose (Fig. 1A, right). Glucose depletion induced
AMPK phosphorylation in cells with wild-type but not mutant
LKB1. To investigate if PIAs activated AMPK in the absence of
LKB1, we treated the three LKB1-mutant NSCLC cell lines (H157,
A549, and H460) with PIA5. PIA5 caused rapid phosphorylation of
AMPK at T172 that was sustained to 2 h in these cell lines (Fig. 1B).
Despite increased AMPK phosphorylation in the absence of LKB1,
these effects were not likely due to increases in AMP levels, because
PIAs did not change the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio in H157 cells
(data not shown). Activation of AMPK was also dose-dependent.
PIA5 activated AMPK in H157 cells at doses of >1 Amol/L, and
maximal activation occurred at 10 Amol/L (Fig. 1C, left). Dose

PIAs activate AMPK in LKB1-mutant NSCLC cells. Because
PIAs increased the activity of purified AMPK by f40% in the
absence of LKB1 in vitro (19), we investigated if they could activate
AMPK in a panel of cancer cell lines that varied in LKB1 mutational
status. Four NSCLC cell lines (H157, H1155, H460, and A549) and
one prostate cancer cell line (PC3) were tested. Immunoblotting

were treated with PIA5 for the indicated times. C, H157 and H1155 cells were treated with varying concentrations of PIA5 for 2 h. D, LKB1-mutant A549 cells,
LKB1-wt H1155 cells or PC3 cells were treated with PIA5, PIA6, PIA7, PIA23, PIA24, or PIA25 for 2 h. Immunoblotting in C and D was performed using
antibodies specific to phosphorylated or native AMPK.

Figure 2. Phosphorylation of AMPK by PIA5 occurs independently of other activities of PIAs. A, H157 cells were pretreated with vehicle or LY294002, then
incubated with PIA5 or LY294002 for the indicated times. Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies specific for phosphorylated and native AMPK or
phosphorylated Akt. B, H1155 cells were treated with PIA5 or LY294002 for the indicated times. Phosphorylation of AMPK, total AMPK, as well as
phosphorylation of Akt, downstream substrates of AMPK (ACC ) and Akt (GSK3a/b), and a downstream substrate of mTOR (S6K) are shown. C, H157 cells were
pretreated with vehicle or SB203580, and then treated with vehicle or PIA5 for the indicated times. Phosphorylation of AMPK, p38, and hsp27, as well as total
levels of AMPK were assessed. D, isogenic wild-type or p38a / MEFs were treated with PIA5 for 2 h prior to immunoblotting for phosphorylated AMPK,
as well as phosphorylated and total p38a.

suggest that the ability of PIAs to activate AMPK depends on the
inositol ring and not the lipid side chain that is shared by all PIAs.
Phosphorylation of AMPK by PIAs occurs independently of
Akt inhibition and p38A activation. Because PIAs independently
inhibit Akt and activate p38a (19), we sought to determine whether
AMPK activation was independent of these activities. To test
independence from Akt inhibition, we pretreated NSCLC cell lines
with LY294002 to inhibit the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt
pathway prior to PIA administration. In H157 cells, PIA5 increased
phosphorylation of AMPK and inhibited Akt phosphorylation
within 15 min, which was sustained throughout the 2-h time course
(Fig. 2A). LY294002 alone rapidly inhibited Akt and only slightly
increased phosphorylation of AMPK over baseline levels. Pretreatment of H157 cells with LY294002 did not affect PIA-induced
AMPK phosphorylation. Pretreatment with LY294002 for longer
periods (18 h) before addition of PIA5 also did not affect PIAinduced AMPK activation (data not shown). These data show that
even when Akt is completely inhibited, PIAs could activate AMPK.
To confirm the independence of Akt inhibition and AMPK
activation, we treated H1155 cells, which do not decrease Akt

dependence was also assessed in H1155 cells that have wild-type
LKB1 (Fig. 1C, right). As was observed in LKB1-mutant H157 cells,
1 Amol/L of PIA5 was sufficient to induce AMPK phosphorylation,
but maximal phosphorylation was achieved at a lower dose
(5 Amol/L). Collectively, these experiments show that PIA5 rapidly
activates AMPK in NSCLC cell lines independently of LKB1, and
that AMPK activation occurs with similar time- and dosedependence as inhibition of Akt and activation of p38a.
To assess whether AMPK activation was common among the five
PIAs that inhibit Akt, we treated LKB1-mutant and wild-type
NSCLC cell lines with the five active PIAs (Fig. 1C, left and middle).
In both LKB1-mutant and -wt cells, the active PIAs increased
AMPK phosphorylation in comparison to an inactive PIA (PIA7;
Fig. 1D). The magnitude of induction of AMPK phosphorylation
was specific for individual PIAs and was cell line–dependent. PIAinduced activation of AMPK was not specific to NSCLC cells
because the active PIAs, but not PIA7, increased AMPK
phosphorylation in the prostate cancer cell line, PC3 (Fig. 1D,
bottom). Because the active PIAs and inactive PIA differ by the
presence or absence of an inositol ring, respectively, these studies

Figure 3. CaMKKh, but not LKB1, is necessary for PIA-induced AMPK activation in cells. A, immortalized isogenic wild-type or LKB1 / MEFs were treated with PIA5

inhibited PIA5-induced phosphorylation of p38 and hsp27, but did
not affect the ability of PIA5 to induce the phosphorylation of
AMPK. Similar results were observed when we treated p38a /
MEFs or wt MEFs with PIA5 and assessed AMPK and p38a
phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). In both cell lines, induction of AMPK
phosphorylation was observed. These results show that activation
of AMPK and p38a are two distinct activities of PIAs.
CaMKKB, but not LKB1, is necessary for PIA-induced AMPK
activation in cells. Because we observed that LKB1 was not
required for activation of AMPK by PIAs, we wanted to assess
whether the presence of LKB1 could contribute to AMPK activation
by PIAs. We treated immortalized LKB1 / or wt MEFs with PIA5.
Basal levels of AMPK phosphorylation were higher in wt MEFs.
Treatment of LKB1 / MEFS with PIA5 resulted in rapid AMPK
phosphorylation similar to the NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 3A). In the wt
MEFs, treatment with PIA5 caused a smaller relative increase in the
phosphorylation of AMPK, and did not occur until a later time point
(2 h), suggesting that the contribution of LKB1 to AMPK activation
by PIAs is minimal. We then reconstituted LKB1 into LKB1 /
cells and assessed AMPK phosphorylation with PIA treatment
(Fig. 3B). LKB1 / MEFs transfected with vector alone exhibited

activation with PIA administration, with PIA5. PIA5 alone only
minimally inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and its substrate
GSK3h (Fig. 2B), even when treatment was extended to 18 h (data
not shown). In contrast, LY294002 markedly inhibited Akt
phosphorylation. Although PIA5 minimally inhibited Akt, it
markedly activated AMPK and inhibited the mTOR pathway, as
shown by decreased phosphorylation of one of the downstream
components of the mTOR pathway, S6K. This observation is
consistent with AMPK’s established role as a negative regulator of
the mTOR pathway (12, 14). These studies show that PIAs cause
rapid and sustained phosphorylation of AMPK in cells independently of their ability to inhibit Akt. Moreover, in some cell types
such as H1155 cells, activation of AMPK might be a major
mechanism for mTOR inhibition.
To show that phosphorylation of AMPK by PIAs also occurs
independently of p38a activation, two approaches were employed.
First, we inhibited p38 with a small molecule inhibitor, SB203580,
prior to PIA administration. In H157 cells, PIA5 alone rapidly
induced the phosphorylation of AMPK, p38a, and one of its
substrates, hsp27 (Fig. 2C). These effects were maintained
throughout the 2-h time course. Pretreatment with SB203580

NSCLC cells with an inhibitor of CAMKK, STO-609 (30). STO-609
markedly inhibited PIA-induced phosphorylation of AMPK and
ACC at 2 h in H1155 cells (Fig. 3C, left), but phosphorylation
partially recovered at 12 h. Repeated dosing of STO-609 did not
affect recovery at 12 h (data not shown), which suggests that this
recovery is not due to the metabolism of STO-609 and could be
related to the utilization of LKB1.
We repeated these studies in two LKB1-mutant cell lines, H157
and A549. As we observed in H1155 cells with wt LKB1,
pretreatment with STO-609 effectively inhibited PIA-induced

the same rapid induction of AMPK phosphorylation as that
observed in untransfected LKB1 / MEFs (Fig. 3A). In contrast,
LKB1 / MEFs reconstituted with LKB1 showed a diminished
ability to induce AMPK phosphorylation that was similar to the wt
MEFs. Taken together, these studies suggest that LKB1 does not
significantly contribute to PIA-induced activation of AMPK.
Similar to LKB1, CaMKKh could also directly activate AMPK by
phosphorylation of T172 (27–29). To determine if CaMKKh
contributed to PIA-induced AMPK phosphorylation at this residue,
we pretreated LKB1-wt (H1155) and LKB1-mutant (H157 and A549)

(PIA23), and assessed the phosphorylation of AMPK after 1 day.
Activation of AMPK in tumors was assessed by immunoblotting or
immunohistochemical analysis. Immunoblotting for phosphorylated AMPK in these tumors showed a statistically significant >2-fold
increase in AMPK phosphorylation in mice that received PIA23
versus mice that received vehicle (data not shown). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that PIA23 caused a 2.3-fold increase
in the staining index for phosphorylation of AMPK in tumors
(Fig. 4C). These studies indicate that induction of AMPK
phosphorylation in vivo can be detected by immunoblotting or
immunohistochemistry, and that induction is not cell line–specific
or PIA-specific. Moreover, they suggest that AMPK phosphorylation
might be useful as a biomarker for PIA administration in vivo.
Loss of AMPK attenuates the cytotoxicity of PIAs. To
investigate the contribution of AMPK to PIA-induced cytotoxicity,
we assessed apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death induced by
PIA5 in immortalized AMPKa / MEFs or isogenic AMPKa wt
MEFs. PIA5 caused 60% of wt MEFs to undergo cell death (Fig. 5A).
Loss of AMPK increased resistance to PIA5 because PIA5 only
caused the death of 31% of the AMPKa / MEFs. Similar results
were observed when apoptosis was assessed. Thirty-two percent of
PIA-treated AMPKa wt MEFs were apoptotic, but PIA treatment
caused only 17% of AMPKa / cells to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 5B,
left). These results show that loss of AMPK attenuates apoptotic
and nonapoptotic cell death caused by PIAs.
To evaluate changes in pathway activation that accompany cell
death, we assessed the phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC, Akt, and
S6K in each type of MEF. In wt MEFs, PIA5 increased the
phosphorylation of AMPK as well as one of its substrates, ACC, and

phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC at 2 h in both LKB1-mutant
cell lines (Fig. 3C, top and bottom right). However, in contrast to
what we observed in the LKB1-wt cells, STO-609 inhibition of PIAinduced AMPK activation was sustained through 12 h in both cell
lines. To confirm a role for CaMKKh in the activation of AMPK by
PIAs, we treated a NSCLC cell line that bears a mutation in
CaMKKh (H1770) with PIA5 (23). Although PIA5 activated p38 in
H1770 cells, activation of AMPK or ACC was not observed at either
time point (Fig. 3D). Treatment of H1770 cells with AICAR, which
activates AMPK by an LKB1-dependent mechanism, confirmed
that AMPK could be activated in these cells. Collectively, these
studies suggest that PIA-induced activation of AMPK in cells is
dependent on CaMKKh when LKB1 is mutated.
PIAs inhibit the growth of LKB1-mutant NSCLC tumors and
induce AMPK activation in vivo. To determine if PIAs can inhibit
tumor growth and activate AMPK independently of LKB1 in vivo,
nude mice bearing LKB1-mutant H157 human NSCLC xenografts
were given i.p. injections of vehicle or PIA5 once a day for 5 days
after tumors were allowed to form. PIA caused a 55% decrease in
tumor volume, an effect that was sustained over the course of the
study (Fig. 4A). PIA-induced phosphorylation of AMPK occurred
independently of LKB1 in vivo because immunohistochemical
analysis of tumors from mice treated with PIA showed a 2-fold
increase in staining index for phosphorylation of AMPK (Fig. 4B).
These results show that PIA5 inhibits tumor growth and activates
AMPK in LKB1-mutant NSCLC cells in vivo.
To confirm that activation of AMPK in vivo was not cell line–
specific or limited to a specific PIA, we performed a short-term
xenograft study with a different cell line (PC3) and a different PIA

PIAs activate AMPK

Figure 6. PIAs recapitulate the activity of two tumor
suppressors that converge on mTOR. PIAs independently
inhibit Akt and activate AMPK to negatively regulate the
mTOR pathway in cells. Cellular activation of AMPK by
PIAs occurs by a CaMKKh-dependent mechanism.
Conversely, other activators of AMPK (AICAR and
metformin) activate AMPK by an LKB1-dependent
mechanism. Gray boxes, tumor suppressors.

inhibited Akt, they still inhibited the mTOR pathway through
activation of AMPK. Interestingly, PIAs failed to inhibit the mTOR
pathway in AMPKa / MEFS, suggesting that AMPK activation is
a major mechanism by which PIAs inhibit mTOR. Because mTOR
pathway activation promotes tumorigenesis and tumor growth, the
ability of PIAs to inhibit this pathway through two mechanisms
could contribute to their potential efficacy as anticancer agents.
The ability of PIAs to activate AMPK in an LKB1-independent
manner in vivo is unique among existing activators of AMPK and
could have clinical implications. For example, activators of AMPK
such as AICAR and metformin activate AMPK by an LKB1dependent mechanism (7, 8). Although 2-deoxyglucose can activate
AMPK in the absence of LKB1 (28), this compound significantly
alters the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio, and the level of AMPK
activation induced by 2-deoxyglucose is directly related to the
presence of LKB1 (22, 31). Moreover, 2-deoxyglucose is unlikely to
activate AMPK in vivo because millimolar concentrations of 2deoxyglucose are required to activate AMPK in cultured cells, which
is not likely to be achievable in vivo. Another AMPK activator, the
thienopyridone A769662, can activate purified AMPK, but the role
of upstream kinases in mediating cellular activation of AMPK by
A769662 is unclear and A769662 has not been shown to activate
AMPK in vivo (32, 33). Therefore, PIAs are the first compounds, to
our knowledge, that activate AMPK independently of LKB1 in vivo,
which may be useful in the treatment of LKB1-mutant tumors. This
may be especially relevant for NSCLC, in which LKB1 mutations are
common. The fact that inhibition of tumor growth by PIAs in vivo
correlated with the induction of AMPK phosphorylation in tumor
tissue suggests that AMPK phosphorylation could serve as a useful
biomarker of PIA administration. More broadly, our study lends
support to the development of cancer chemotherapeutics that
target AMPK, and represents the first characterization of compounds that induce cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells by LKB1independent activation of AMPK.

inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and S6K (Fig. 5B). However, in
AMPKa / MEFS, PIA5 did not decrease S6K phosphorylation
despite decreased Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). This again
suggests that AMPK activation is a major mechanism of mTOR
pathway inhibition by PIAs.
To confirm that AMPK activation contributes to PIA-induced
cell death in NSCLC cells, we transiently transfected H157 cells
with a construct that encodes a dominant-negative mutant form of
AMPK (K45R) or a vector control, and measured total cell death
induced by PIA5. Consistent with data obtained in AMPKa /
MEFs, transfection of H157 cells with the dominant-negative AMPK
construct resulted in 50% less cell death in response to treatment
with PIA5 than cells transfected with vector (Fig. 5C). These results
confirm that AMPK activation by PIAs contributes to their
cytotoxicity.

Discussion
Our studies show that the lipid-based Akt inhibitors, PIAs,
independently activate AMPK through multiple mechanisms. PIAs
directly activate purified AMPK in the absence of upstream kinases.
In cells, PIAs activate AMPK by inducing the phosphorylation of
AMPK on T172, an effect that seemed to be dependent on CaMKKh
but was independent of LKB1. Pretreatment of NSCLC cells with
the CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 completely abolished PIA-induced
activation of AMPK in LKB1-mutant cells, and delayed activation in
cells with wt LKB1. Moreover, PIAs failed to activate AMPK in
CaMKKh mutant cells. These results show that activation of AMPK
preferentially occurs through CaMKKh.
Although PIAs activated AMPK with similar kinetics and dose
dependence as Akt inhibition and p38a activation, AMPK
activation is a distinct activity of PIAs because inhibition of
phosphoinositide-3-kinase or p38 did not affect AMPK activation
by PIAs. Likewise, Akt inhibition and p38 activation by PIAs are not
likely to be dependent on AMPK because PIAs modulated these
targets in AMPKa / MEFs. The ability of PIAs to independently
affect the activities of AMPK, Akt, and p38a shows the broad
biological activities of these compounds, and highlights their
diverse potential as anticancer agents.
As PIAs independently inhibit Akt and activate AMPK, they are
distinct among existing cancer chemotherapeutics because they
recapitulate the activity of two tumor suppressors, LKB1 and PTEN,
to negatively regulate the mTOR pathway (Fig. 6). For example,
even in cell lines such as H1155 in which PIAs only marginally
