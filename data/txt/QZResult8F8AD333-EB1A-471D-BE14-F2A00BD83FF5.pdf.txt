Abstract
Elevated levels of the proinﬂammatory cytokine IL6 are
associated with poor survival outcomes in many cancers.
Antibodies targeting IL6 and its receptor have been developed
for chronic inﬂammatory disease, but they have not yet been
shown to clearly beneﬁt cancer patients, possibly due to
antibody potency or the settings in which they have been
tested. In this study, we describe the development of a novel
high-afﬁnity anti-IL6 antibody, MEDI5117, which features an
extended half-life and potent inhibitory effects on IL6 biologic
activity. MEDI5117 inhibited IL6-mediated activation of
STAT3, suppressing the growth of several tumor types driven
by IL6 autocrine signaling. In the same models, MEDI5117
displayed superior preclinical activity relative to a previously
developed anti-IL6 antibody. Consistent with roles for IL6 in

promoting tumor angiogenesis, we found that MEDI5117
inhibited the growth of endothelial cells, which can produce
IL6 and support tumorigenesis. Notably, in tumor xenograft
assays in mice, we documented the ability of MEDI5117 to
enhance the antitumor activities of chemotherapy or geﬁtinib
in combination treatment regimens. MEDI5117 also displayed
robust activity on its own against trastuzumab-resistant HER2þ
tumor cells by targeting the CD44þCD24 cancer stem cell
population. Collectively, our ﬁndings extend the evidence of
important pleiotropic roles of IL6 in tumorigenesis and drug
resistance, and offer a preclinical proof of concept for the
use of IL6 antibodies in combination regimens to heighten
therapeutic responses and overcome drug resistance. Cancer Res;

Introduction

binding protein (IL6Ra chain, CD126) and a 130 kDa signal
transduction glycoprotein (gp130). IL6 binds to the transmembrane IL6Ra protein and the IL6/IL6Ra complex binds to two
molecules of gp130, which then activates an intracellular signaling cascade. This mechanism is known as classical signaling.
IL6Ra also exists as a soluble receptor (sIL6Ra), which can
combine with IL6 to trigger membrane-bound gp130 dimerization and thus mediate the so-called trans-signaling (3, 4). Because
of the ubiquitous expression of gp130 on different cell types, the
trans-signaling mechanism is attributed to the broad array of IL6
functions in the body. Activated gp130 stimulates JAK tyrosine
kinases, which phosphorylate and recruit the transcription factor
STAT3 to regulate gene expression (5).
Many cancers exploit IL6 as a growth factor as well as a modiﬁer
of the tumor microenvironment. Solid tumors such as lung,
ovarian, breast, and colon carcinomas produce IL6, IL6Ra and
gp130, allowing them to constitutively stimulate their own growth
in autocrine manner (6–8). Other cancers, such as multiple
myeloma and neuroblastoma, do not produce IL6, but do express
IL6Ra and gp130; these tumors respond to IL6 produced in the
tumor microenvironment in a paracrine manner (9). IL6 plays
multiple roles in tumor progression and drug resistance (10–12). It
can act directly on tumor cells, or function by interacting with
normal cells in the tumor microenvironment, including endothelial, immune, and inﬂammatory cells. Targeting IL6 and its pathway therefore is expected to inhibit tumors through multiple
mechanisms. Several anti-IL6 antibodies are in clinical development for cancer therapy. Among these, siltuximab (CNTO328) is

IL6 is produced by lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells including
T and B cells, monocytes, ﬁbroblasts, keratinocytes, as well as
endothelial, mesangial, and tumor cells (1, 2). Its pleiotropic roles
include the activation of T cells, induction of the acute phase
inﬂammatory response, differentiation, and survival of plasma B
cells, synovial ﬁbroblasts, and osteoclasts, and stimulation of
growth and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells (3).
IL6 acts on target cells by binding to the IL6 receptor (IL6R), which
consists of two membrane-bound proteins, an 80 kDa ligand-

IL6 Blockade in Combination and Drug-Resistant Settings

the most advanced and is being tested in the clinic for multiple
types of cancer. Published data suggest that anti-IL6 antibody
therapies have acceptable safety and tolerability (13–15).
In this study, we further elucidate the critical role of IL6 in
cancer biology in multiple solid tumor types and provide evidence
that IL6 is an anticancer target in mono- and especially combination therapy settings. MEDI5117 is a human monoclonal
antibody (mAb) that potently binds and neutralizes human IL6.
It was engineered to have increased persistence in circulation
compared with unmodiﬁed antibodies through incorporation of
YTE mutations in the Fc region (16, 17). MEDI5117 inhibited IL6
signaling and suppressed the growth of lung, breast, and ovarian
tumor cells in vitro and in vivo with higher potency than siltuximab. Inhibition of tumor growth was signiﬁcantly increased
when MEDI5117 was used in combination with geﬁtinib, taxanes,
or other chemotherapeutics. Furthermore, MEDI5117 suppressed
the growth of IL6-dependent trastuzumab-resistant breast
tumors, and this was associated with a reduction of cancer stem
cells (CSC). These results extend our understanding of the role of
IL6 in tumor biology and demonstrate the potential of MEDI5117
for the treatment of multiple cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents
Cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. Cell line
authentication was conducted by STR-based DNA ﬁngerprinting
and multiplex PCR. IMPACT tests were also performed on all cell
lines.
CellTiterGlo reagents were obtained from Promega. An enzyme
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed in our
laboratories to detect free IL6 in tumor lysates. Human IL6 and
sIL6R ELISA kits were purchased from R&D Systems. Recombinant human IL6 and sIL6R proteins were obtained from R&D
Systems. Antibodies to detect STAT3 and phospho-STAT3-Tyr705
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology and gp130 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. MCF-7/IL6–
overexpressing cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Mercedes
Rincone (University of Vermont, Burlington, VT; ref. 18). Siltuximab (CNTO328) was generated inhouse based on published
sequence information.
siRNA Knockdown
A reverse transfection protocol was used to analyze the effects of
IL6 and IL6R knockdown. Brieﬂy, siRNA pools targeting IL6 and
IL6R (Dharmacon) were prepared at a ﬁnal concentration of 50
nmol/L in optiMEM (Invitrogen). DU145 cells were then added to
the siRNAs at a density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates in
medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Life Technologies). After 48 hours, transfected cells were washed with ice-cold
PBS and then lysed by adding Laemmli reducing buffer (Boston
BioProducts). Cell lysates were then subjected to Western blot
analysis for phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3). Conditioned medium was analyzed in duplicate with human IL6 and soluble IL6R
ELISA kits (R&D Systems). For proliferation assays, CellTiter
Glo reagent was used ﬁve days after transfection and luminescence
was measured using an EnVision 2104 Multilabel Reader
(PerkinElmer).
Cell proliferation analysis
For DU145 cells, cell proliferation was assessed by threedimensional tumor spheroid assay. Cells were plated at a density

www.aacrjournals.org

of 8,000 cells per well. Plates were spun down and incubated
overnight to allow cells to assemle into compact spheroids. Twoday-old spheroids were treated with human recombinant IL6 or
sIL6R proteins (R&D Systems) with MEDI5117 at varying concentrations. After 7-day incubation, proliferation was quantiﬁed
using the CellTiter-Glo assay using an EnVision 2104 Multilabel
Reader (PerkinElmer).
For human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), cells
were cultured as monolayers. Recombinant proteins and antibody were added on next day. After 72 hour incubation, proliferation was quantiﬁed using the CellTiter-Glo assay.
mRNA proﬁling
Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen xenograft tumor
samples using the ZR RNA MicroPrep Kit (Zymo Research).
Xenograft tumors were treated with 30 mg/kg of MEDI5117 or
IgG isotype control IgG1 for a total of two doses. Generating
biotin-labeled ampliﬁed cRNA was accomplished using the MessageAmpTM Premier RNA Ampliﬁcation Kit (Ambion) and used
for gene expression with Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus
2.0 GeneChip microarrays. Canonical pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. All microarray data are deposited in GEO repository under accession
number is GSE62941: (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token¼ujajyuyovbqzdyf&acc¼GSE62941).
Mouse xenograft studies
All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with all
appropriate regulatory standards under protocols approved by
the Medimmune Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
For the MCF-7 xenograft study, 0.36 mg of an estrogen pellet
was implanted subcutaneously into the left ﬂank of each female
athymic nude mouse. The effect of the estrogen pellet lasted for 60
days in vivo. Two million MCF7 or MCF7/IL6 tumor cells were
suspended in 100 mL of BME (6 mg/mL) before injection. All mice
received an orthotopic inoculation of tumor cells into the mammary fat pad.
For in vivo efﬁcacy studies, 5 million NCI-H1650, KPL-4,
DU145, or MDAH2774 cells in 50% Matrigel were inoculated
subcutaneously into each female athymic nude mouse. When
tumors reached approximately 150 to 200 mm3, mice were
randomly assigned into groups (10 mice per group). MEDI5117
or siltuximab was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice per
week at indicated doses. Tumor volumes were measured twice
weekly with calipers. Tumor growth inhibition was calculated on
the last day of study relative to the initial and ﬁnal mean tumor
volume of the control group.
For in vivo mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic
studies, a single dose of MEDI5117 was administered when tumors reached approximately 400 mm3. Tumor and serum samples were collected 4 hours after dosing.
CSC analyses
For tumorsphere assays, single cells were plated on ultra-low
attachment plates at a density of 1105/mL and grown for 7 days
in a mammocult medium (Stem Cell Technologies). After the
treatment of primary spheres with drugs, they were dissociated
into single-cell suspension and plated at a density of 5103–
1104/mL. Secondary spheres were counted after 5 to 7 days in
culture and evaluated the efﬁcacy of the drug treatment.

For CD44þCD24 CSC ﬂow cytometry analyses, single-cell
suspensions of residual tumors cells isolated from drug-treated
mice were incubated with ﬂuorophore-conjugated CD44 or CD24
antibodies alone or in combination on ice for 30 minutes, washed
with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), and resuspended in
DAPI containing HBSS buffer for ﬂow cytometry analyses. Gate
compensation was performed with single color–stained cells and
the CD44þCD24 phenotype analyses were performed using the
double stained cells.
Tumor reimplantation studies were conducted using cells
recovered from the residual tumors of treated animals. Tumors
were excised, chopped, and processed with collagenase for 1 to 2
hours at 37 C. Cells were then washed with PBS, trypsinized, and
passed through a 40 mm ﬁlter. The single cells were labeled with
H-2Kd antibody to distinguish human cells from mouse cells and
DAPI and then sorted with ﬂow cytometry. Live human tumor
cells were reimplanted orthotopically into mouse mammary fat
pads to determine tumor initiation capacity. Tumors were measured weekly using luciferase bioluminescense and by caliper.
CSC frequencies were calculated by limiting dilution analyses
using the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute formula (http://bioinf.
wehi.edu.au/software/elda/; ref. 19).

Results
IL6 is a potent growth factor and its downstream signaling is
activated in multiple cancer types
IL6 is known to be a potent growth factor in some cancer cell
lines, and we observed this in the models we studied as well. For
example, siRNA knockdown of either IL6 or IL6 receptor strongly
inhibited the proliferation of DU145 prostate cancer cells, as well
as their levels of activated STAT3, the downstream effector of the
IL6 signaling pathway (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similarly, overexpression of IL6 increased the growth rate of MCF-7 cancer cells
in vitro and in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Although activation of IL6 signaling can occur through paracrine mechanisms, we found evidence of autocrine IL6 signaling
in several cancer cell lines (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2).
MDAH2774 (ovarian cancer), NCI-H1650 and NCI-H1975
(non–small cell lung cancer, NSCLC), DU145 (prostate cancer),
and Detroit 562 (head and neck cancer) cells produced IL6 and

sIL6R. Membrane-bound IL6R and gp130 and intracellular
pSTAT3 were detected in these cell lines as well. These components allow these cell lines to stimulate their own growth through
an IL6-dependent autocrine loop. In contrast, MDA-MB-468 and
MCF-7 (breast cancer) cells do not secrete IL6 and MDA-MB-231
(breast cancer) and U87MG (glioblastoma) cells secrete relatively
high levels of IL6, but lack IL6R on the surface.
An anti-IL6 antibody, MEDI5117, inhibits cancer cell and
endothelial cell proliferation
MEDI5117 is a human, high afﬁnity, IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that neutralizes human IL6. The parental antibody
(CAT-6001) was obtained by screening phage display human
antibody libraries for binding to recombinant human IL6 and for
inhibition of the IL6/IL6R interaction (14). We then created
MEDI5117 by incorporating three amino acid substitutions,
M252Y, S254T, and T256E (YTE), into the Fc region of CAT6001 to increase the antibody's half life in vivo. Pharmacokinetic
studies in cynomolgus monkeys showed that the half-life of
MEDI5117 was extended by 3-fold (28.4 vs. 8.4 days) and
clearance was reduced by 4-fold (3.02 vs. 12.1 mL/kg/day) when
compared with CAT-6001 (16, 17). The half-life of MEDI5117 in
humans was 84 days, signiﬁcantly longer than other anti-IL6
antibodies, such as siltuximab whose half-life was 17.8 days.
MEDI5117 binds IL6 with high afﬁnity. In the KinExa assay,
MEDI5117 had a Kd < 1 pmol/L, while siltuximab had a Kd ¼
6.25 pmol/L. By ELISA, MEDI5117 had an EC50 ¼ 6.5 pmol/L for
human IL6 binding as measured, more potent than that of
siltuximab (EC50 ¼ 14.1 pmol/L). MEDI5117 cross reacts with
cynomolgus monkey IL6, but not with IL6 from other species,
including dogs, rats, and mice.
The effect of MEDI5117 on the proliferation of cancer cells was
investigated in DU145 prostate cancer cells using a spheroid
formation assay. Stimulating DU145 cells with recombinant
human IL6 resulted in increased cell proliferation as measured
by the number of spheroids grown in serum-free medium for
seven days. The addition of sIL6Ra alone had little effect on
DU145 cell proliferation. Addition of IL6 in combination with
sIL6Ra stimulated cell growth to the same extent as IL6 treatment
alone. This ﬁnding indicates that the proliferative effect of IL6 on

The IL6 pathway is hyperactivated in
several cancer cell lines. Conditioned
medium from various cancer cell lines
was collected and analyzed in
duplicate. Human IL6 and soluble IL6R
were measured by ELISA, membrane
IL6R expression was analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry, and protein levels of
gp130, pSTAT3, STAT3, and GAPDH
were assessed by Western blotting.

MEDI5117 inhibited cell proliferation and blocked STAT3 activation in cancer cell lines and endothelial cells. A, DU145 spheroids were grown in serum-free medium and
stimulated with recombinant human IL6 and soluble IL6R, or IL6 þ sIL6R at the indicated concentrations in the presence of 20 mg/mL control IgG antibody
or MEDI5117 (left). Treatments were performed in triplicate and mean spheroid numbers and standard deviations were calculated. A, DU145 cells and HUVECs
were incubated with recombinant human IL6 and sIL6R along with 20 mg/mL control antibody or MEDI5117 (right). Proliferation was measured using the CellTiter
Glo assay and growth induction over the untreated control was calculated. All treatments were performed in triplicate and mean, and SDs were calculated.
B, the inhibitory activities of MEDI5117 and siltuximab were compared in vitro. DU145 and TF-1 cells were stimulated with recombinant human IL6 in the
presence of MEDI5117 or siltuximab (CNTO328). C and D, MEDI5117, siltuximab, and a control IgG were added directly to the cells for a ﬁnal concentration of 30 mg/mL
in the presence of 10 ng/mL of IL6, sIL6R, or IL6/sIL6R. After 24 hours, cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis.

DU145 spheroids occurs through classical signaling involving
the membrane-bound receptor. Treatment with MEDI5117
completely blocked IL6-induced spheroid growth (Fig. 2A, left).
Proliferation was not blocked by treatment with a control isotypematched IgG1 mAb.
HUVEC cells do not express membrane bound IL6Ra (20), and
therefore IL6 stimulation of HUVECs relies on trans-signaling
(21). Adding recombinant human IL6 or sIL6R alone had only
modest effects on HUVEC proliferation. However, adding IL6
with sIL6R together resulted in signiﬁcantly increased HUVEC

proliferation (Fig. 2A, right). Treatment with MEDI5117 blocked
the HUVEC proliferation induced by IL6 and sIL6R. Thus,
MEDI5117 can inhibit proliferation of cancer cells by blocking
classical IL6 signaling and proliferation of endothelial cells by
blocking IL6 trans-signaling in vitro.
The inhibitory activities of MEDI5117 and siltuximab were
compared in both DU145 cells and TF-1 (erythroleukemic) cells.
Treatment with MEDI5117 or siltuximab blocked IL6-induced cell
proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B); however,
MEDI5117 was more potent than siltuximab based on IC50 values.

Zhong et al.

These results corroborate that MEDI5117 can inhibit both classical and trans-signaling stimulated by IL6.

IL6 signaling involves activation of the transcription factor,
STAT3. To analyze effects on STAT3, several different cancer cell
lines and HUVECs were treated with MEDI5117, siltuximab, or a
control IgG1 mAb (Fig. 2C, left). Basal levels of pSTAT3 (it's
activated form) were suppressed by MEDI5117 in each of the cell
lines; treatment with siltuximab resulted in less efﬁcient suppression. Addition of recombinant human IL6 activated STAT3 in
both the MDAH2774 and DU145 cancer cell lines, and pretreatment with MEDI5117 blocked this activation (Fig. 2C, right). In
DU145 cells, the level of pSTAT3 in MEDI5117-treated cells was
even lower than the basal level of pSTAT3 in untreated cells.
MEDI5117 treatment reduced basal pSTAT3 levels, and reversed
IL6 or IL6/sIL6R induced STAT3 activation in HUVECs (Fig. 2D).

MEDI5117 was evaluated in NSCLC (NCI-H1650), ovarian
(MDAH-2774), and prostate (DU145) xenograft models in vivo
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3). These tumor models produce IL6 and bear cell surface IL6R. MEDI5117 at 30 mg/kg alone
caused tumor growth inhibition (DTGI) of 51% (P ¼ 0.004) in
NCI-H1650 and 59% DTGI (P ¼ 0.007) in MDAH2774. Doses
between 3 and 30 mg/kg showed comparable DTGI with the 30
mg/kg dose. A low dose of 1 mg/kg was insufﬁcient to inhibit

tumor growth. MEDI5117 treatment was well tolerated in mice as
no body weight loss was observed compared with control groups.
The antitumor activity of MEDI5117 was also found to be superior
to that of siltuximab in DU145 and MDAH2774 xenograft models
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
Free human IL6 levels were measured in NCI-H1650 xenograft
tumors in both control IgG1 and MEDI5117-treated mice.
MEDI5117 treatment suppressed human IL6 levels in both serum
and tumor lysates in vivo. In addition, MEDI5117 treatment
resulted in more than 50% reduction of pSTAT3 levels in tumor
cell lysates as detected by ELISA (Fig. 3B). Immunohistochemistry
conﬁrmed this reduction, and also showed pSTAT3 reduction in
tumor cells and stromal cells within and surrounding the tumor
(Fig. 3C). Cell proliferation was also reduced, as assessed by
immunohistochemistry with anti-Ki67 antibodies (Fig. 3D).
It is important to note that MEDI5117 does not bind to
systemic mouse IL6, which is known to regulate tumor microenvironment and contribute to xenograft tumor growth. This may
explain the partial tumor growth inhibition we observed in vivo,
and also suggests that our results underestimate the antitumor
effects that MEDI5117 would exert in cancer patients. To conﬁrm
that MEDI5117 could inhibit systemic IL6 in vivo, a model was
generated in which human IL6 was administered by intraperitoneal injection into male C57/B/6/J mice. Systemic administration
of IL6 is known to trigger an elevation of acute phase proteins such
as haptoglobulin. MEDI5117 dose dependently inhibited the
haptoglobulin levels induced by human IL6, with signiﬁcant
inhibition being noted at doses of 78 mg/kg and higher. Siltuximab had a similar effect at a dose of 266 mg/kg, much higher than
that of MEDI5117 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore,
MEDI5117 was more potent than siltuximab in inhibiting human
IL6 in vivo.
MEDI5117 was also tested in the MDA-MB-468 model, which
does not secrete IL6, and the U87MG model, which produces IL6
but does not express surface IL6R. No TGI was observed in these
models (data not shown), suggesting an active IL6 autocrine loop
is the key determinant of sensitivity to anti-IL6 cancer activity in
xenograft models.
MEDI5117 inhibits expression of IL6 target genes and
angiogenic genes
To further understand the mechanism of action of MEDI5117,
whole genome mRNA proﬁling was performed on untreated or
MEDI5117-treated tumor xenograft samples. Table 1 lists the
genes whose expression was most downregulated with
MEDI5117 treatment in the three responsive models (DU145,
NCI-H1650, and KPL-4). All of these genes are known to be
transcriptional regulation targets of the IL6/JAK/STAT3, AKT, and
MAPK pathways. Among these, SOCS3 (suppression of cytokine
signaling 3) mRNA was found to be consistently downregulated
by MEDI5117 in all three models. The expression of SOCS3 is
induced by cytokines such as IL6, IL10, and IFNg. In contrast, no

modulation of IL6–related pathway gene expression was observed
in the nonresponsive models (NCI-H1975, U87MG; data not
shown).
We explored effects on gene expression further using a human
angiogenesis gene array. MEDI5117 treatment inhibited the
expression of several genes involved in angiogenesis such as KDR,
PECAM-1, and VEGF as shown in Table 2. The downregulation of
KDR and PECAM-1 expression was conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR
analysis (Fig. 3E). We also found reductions in CD31 expression,
blood microvessel density, and the size of vessel lumens in
NCI-H1650 tumors after MEDI5117 treatment (Fig. 3F). This
demonstrates that IL6 is involved in angiogenesis in some tumor
types, and extends our previous ﬁndings studying ovarian cancer
cells (22). Thus, the antitumor effects of MEDI5117 involve
inhibition of tumor cell growth and suppression of angiogenesis.
Neutralization of IL6 with MEDI5117 enhances antitumor
activities of chemotherapeutic agents and geﬁtinib
We tested the antitumor efﬁcacy of MEDI5117 in combination
with several standard-of-care therapies in various mouse cancer
models. All of the combination treatments we tested were well
tolerated. The effect of combining MEDI5117 with taxol, a standard-of-care for breast, ovarian, NSCLC, and prostate cancers
(23), was evaluated in the NCI-H1650 xenograft models. Treatment with either MEDI5117 or taxol alone inhibited tumor
growth by 50% and 92% at the end of treatment, respectively.
Combination treatment with MEDI5117 plus taxol resulted in

tumor regression (DTGI ¼ 102%), with 2 of 10 mice experiencing
complete tumor regression. Tumor regrowth was monitored
following the discontinuation of the treatments. Animals in the
taxol only treatment group showed rapid regrowth of their
tumors. However, the regrowth of the tumors in mice treated
with the combination of MEDI5117 and taxol was signiﬁcantly
delayed. The two mice that had complete tumor regression
remained tumor free at the end of the regrowth phase (Fig. 4A,
left). Free human IL6 and pSTAT3 levels were measured in NCIH1650 xenograft mice treated with MEDI5117, taxol, and a
combination of both (Fig. 4A, middle and right). Taxol treatment
resulted in upregulation of human IL6 and pSTAT3 compared
with baseline levels, indicating activation of the IL6R inﬂammatory pathway. In contrast, treatment with MEDI5117 suppressed
basal IL6 and pSTAT3 and counteracted taxol-stimulated pathway
activation.
The combination of MEDI5117 with taxotere was evaluated in
the KPL-4 breast cancer orthotopic model (Fig. 4B) and DU145
prostate xenograft model (Supplementary Fig. S5A). MEDI5117
alone had a modest effect on KPL-4 tumor growth (DTGI ¼ 29%).
Taxotere was highly efﬁcacious causing regression during the
dosing phase; however, tumors regrew once the treatment was
discontinued. Combining MEDI5117 with taxotere resulted in
complete tumor regression, which lasted for more than two
months (Fig. 4B).
MEDI5117 was also tested in combination with other nontaxane chemotherapeutics including gemcitabine þ cisplatin,

alimta þ carboplatin, doxorubcin, and topotecan (Supplementary Fig. S5). Combination treatments led to enhanced inhibition
or delay in tumor growth compared with either agent alone. In
some cases (Supplementary Figs. S4B and S4D), the combination
efﬁcacy was less pronounced compared with that seen in other
experiments, and in these cases we observed lower induction of
IL6 secretion and signaling by the chemotherapy agent. This
reinforces the hypothesis that patients could be selected for IL6
combination therapy based on assessment of therapy-induced IL6
upregulation.
The effects of combining MEDI5117 and geﬁtinib were examined in the NCI-H1650 xenograft model (Fig. 4C). Both
MEDI5117 alone and geﬁtinib alone inhibited tumor growth,
although geﬁtinib was more effective during the treatment phase
(53% DTGI for geﬁtinib vs. 39% DTGI for MEDI5117). The
combination of MEDI5117 and geﬁtinib enhanced antitumor
activity (70% DTGI). In addition, the combination treatment led
to the strongest posttreatment antitumor activity.
MEDI5117 inhibits a trastuzumab-resistant HER2þ breast
tumor model
We previously reported that activation of an IL6 inﬂammatory
loop mediates trastuzumab resistance in HER2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells (24, 25). BT474 cells, which contain ampliﬁed
HER2, are sensitive to trastuzumab, but PTEN knockdown and
long-term trastuzumab treatment–generated cells (called BT474PTEN-LTT cells) that resisted killing by trastuzumab. Compared

IL6 Blockade in Combination and Drug-Resistant Settings

compared with the parental BT474 formed spontaneous metastases primarily in the lungs, which were inhibited by MEDI5117
treatment (Fig. 5D). In addition, we utilized an NF-kB reporterexpressing BT474-PTEN-LTT cell line to monitor the IL6-mediated
NF-kB activity in vivo (24). MEDI5117 treatment signiﬁcantly
reduced NF-kB activity in growing tumors compared with the
negative control (R347) or trastuzumab-treated animals (Fig. 5E).
The fact that the NF-kB activity correlated with tumor growth
suggests a critical role for IL6-mediated NF-kB signaling in tumor
growth.

with the parental BT474, BT474-PTEN-LTT cells displayed an
aggressive metastatic phenotype. This was due to the induction
of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CSC
expansion mediated by autocrine IL6 secretion. As in our previous
studies, trastuzumab signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of parental BT474 cells in vitro but failed to do so for BT474-PTEN-LTT cells
(Fig. 5A). In contrast, MEDI5117 suppressed the growth of BT474PTEN-LTT cells but did not affect the growth of BT474 cells,
suggesting that this inhibitory activity is speciﬁc to the IL6producing BT474-PTEN-LTT cells.
We reasoned that MEDI5117 might exert these effects on the
BT474-PTEN-LTT cells by sequestering free IL6 and indirectly
reducing the levels of related inﬂammatory cytokines. Elevated
levels of IL6, IL8, TGFb, sIL6R, and surface IL6R in BT474-PTENLTT cells compared with the parental BT474 were demonstrated
by ELISA (Supplementary Figs. S6A and S6B). These proteins were
signiﬁcantly reduced following a 48-hour MEDI5117 treatment in
vitro (Fig. 5B), conﬁrming suppression of the IL6–related inﬂammatory response.
Similar to results from our in vitro studies, parental BT474
tumors were very sensitive to trastuzumab treatment in mouse
xenografts, while they failed to respond to the MEDI5117 treatment (data not shown). In contrast, MEDI5117 exerted a strong
inhibition of BT474-PTEN-LTT tumor growth (Fig. 5C), whereas
this tumor was resistant to trastuzumab treatment in vivo.
Furthermore, we observed that BT474-PTEN-LTT tumors

IL6 neutralization by MEDI5117 inhibits trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer stem cells
Compared with BT474 cells, trastuzumab-resistant BT474PTEN-LTT cells displayed an expanded CSC population characterized by a CD44þCD24 phenotype (24). To determine whether MEDI5117 can target breast CSCs, we performed in vitro
tumorsphere assays. BT474-PTEN-LTT cells displayed considerably higher tumorsphere forming capacity compared with the
parental BT474 (Fig. 6A). MEDI5117 treatment had no effect on
the parental BT474 tumorspheres but signiﬁcantly reduced
tumorsphere formation by BT474-PTEN-LTT cells, indicating
the latter depends on IL6. We also characterized the proportion of
CD44þ/CD24 CSCs in BT474-PTEN-LTT xenografts with or
without MEDI5117 treatment by ﬂow cytometry. Although
parental BT474 lacks CD44þCD24 cells, these CSCs represented

about 75% of the BT474-PTEN-LTT cell population (Fig. 6B). In
line with our in vitro tumorsphere data, the number of CD44þ
CD24 CSCs was substantially lower in BT474-PTEN-LTT xenografts when animals were treated with MEDI5117 compared with
those treated with the negative control antibody, R347. It is
unclear whether, in addition to reducing the CD44þCD24 cell
fraction, MEDI5117 also drives differentiation to the CD44þ
CD24þ phenotype.
To further determine the effect of the MEDI5117 on CSCs, we
next performed reimplantation assays using cells taken from
BT474-PTEN-LTT tumors treated for eight weeks with the negative
control antibody, trastuzumab, or MEDI5117. Recipient mice
were implanted with either 500 or 5,000 cells and monitored
for 12 weeks. Under these conditions, both trastuzumab and
control-treated tumor cells were able to initiate secondary tumors,
although tumors did not grow in all recipient mice (Fig. 6C). In
contrast, MEDI5117-treated primary tumors failed to grow upon
secondary reimplantation in any of the recipient mice, suggesting
elimination of the CSC population. Data from this experiment
was used to estimate the frequency of CSCs after each treatment as
well (Fig. 6D). These results demonstrate that IL6 depletion by
MEDI5117 diminishes the CSC population, which contributes to
overall tumor growth suppression of our trastuzumab-resistant
model.

Discussion
IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that was initially characterized as a
key component of inﬂammatory responses. Therapeutics targeting the IL6 pathway are being developed for inﬂammatory and
autoimmune diseases. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 receptor antibody, was approved in 2009 for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis (26, 27). Siltuximab, a chimeric mouse-human anti-IL6
antibody, was approved to treat patients with Castleman disease
(FDA.gov press release for siltuximab approval, April 24, 2014).
Numerous studies have revealed a role for IL6 in various types
of cancer as well. Elevated levels of IL6 are associated with poor

prognosis in cancers of the lung, colon, kidney, bladder, and
others (28–30). Thus, therapeutics targeting IL6 and IL6 signaling
components are also being tested in clinical trials for cancer.
Siltuximab has been shown to have modest beneﬁt in treating
cancers (13, 31, 32). Clazakizumab (ALD518) improves cancerrelated fatigue and cachexia in NSCLC patients (33, 34). Elsilimomab (BE-8), a murine anti-IL6 mAb, could not efﬁciently
block IL6 levels due to its short half-life and neutralization by
a human anti-mouse immune response, and has generated mixed
results in clinical trials (35). MEDI5117 is a fully human mAb
with no potential immunogenicity issues in human and has a
higher binding afﬁnity for human IL6 (Kd < 1 pmol/L) relative to
other anti-IL6 mAbs. Compared with siltuximab, MEDI5117
showed enhanced in vitro cell killing (Fig. 2B) and pathway
suppression (Fig. 2C) and inhibited systemic IL6 in vivo more
efﬁciently (Supplementary Fig. S3). In mouse xenograft models,
MEDI5117 treatment resulted in an improvement in tumor
growth inhibition compared with siltuximab (Supplementary
Fig. S3). However, mouse models do not permit the signiﬁcant
half-life extension afforded by our engineered YTE mutation in
MEDI5117. The YTE mutation extends the half-life of MEDI5117
in humans almost ﬁve-fold compared with siltuximab. Thus,
MEDI5117 is expected to have signiﬁcantly better clinical activity
and require less frequent dosing in patients compared with
siltuximab and other non-YTE IL6-blocking antibodies.
We found that MEDI5117 inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro
and in vivo. The mechanism of this inhibition involved effects on
IL6-mediated growth signaling through the IL6R/JAK/STAT3
pathway. In addition, repression of endothelial cell growth and
angiogenesis was observed after neutralization of IL6. Gilbert and
Hemann reported that in a mouse model of Burkitt lymphoma,
doxorubicin treatment induced production of IL6 by endothelial
cells in blood vessels, which promoted the survival of residual
tumor cells and eventual tumor relapse (36). That MEDI5117 also
inhibits IL6 activity and growth of human endothelial (HUVEC)
cells suggests that this activity would contribute to its antitumor
effects in humans. Furthermore, extending previous results (37),

IL6 Blockade in Combination and Drug-Resistant Settings

we found that MEDI5117 treatment of several tumor types in vivo
could reduce tumor angiogenesis by downregulation of various
genes including VEGF, KDR, and PECAM-1. Thus, the activity of
MEDI5117 in inhibiting tumor growth reﬂects the pleiotropic
roles of IL6 in cancer.
IL6 overproduction occurs in response to various cancer drug
treatments and in drug-resistant tumors, and thus the full beneﬁts
of suppressing IL6 may be achieved in these situations. We found
that taxanes upregulated IL6 production in NSCLC and prostate
cancer cells, and that the combination of taxanes with MEDI5117
was signiﬁcantly more efﬁcacious than either agent alone. This
efﬁcacy was associated with suppression of activated STAT3, the
downstream effector of the IL6/JAK signaling axis. Similarly,
MEDI5117 combined with taxotere resulted in durable tumor
regression in a breast cancer model, whereas treatment with either
agent alone did not. Activating mutations in the EGFR can
promote IL6 production and activate JAK/STAT3 signaling in
human lung adenocarcinomas (38). Increased IL6 secretion and
consequent autocrine survival signaling were also found to be a
cause of drug resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in NSCLC
(12). Conversely, IL6 antibody treatment can upregulate EGFR
expression and limit ovarian tumor growth inhibition (39). This
suggests that a combined approach blocking both the EGFR and
IL6 pathways may improve response and counteract resistance.
Our results showing that MEDI5117 in combination with geﬁtinib enhanced antitumor efﬁcacy in the H1650 NSCLC model
supports this hypothesis. We also generated geﬁtinib-resistant
H1650 cells and found that MEDI5117 treatment restored sensitivity to this drug (data not shown).
Our previous work showed that activation of an IL6 feedback
loop may play a role in trastuzmab resistance in PTEN-deleted
HER2þ tumors (24). We therefore tested the activity of MEDI5117
in our trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer model, which produces
high levels of IL6. Neutralization of IL6 by MEDI5117 potently
inhibited the growth of this trastuzumab resistant tumor. In contrast, the antibody had no activity against matched EGFR-sensitive
(PTEN wild-type) tumor cells that do not overproduce IL6. Growth
inhibition of the trastuzumab-resistant tumor model by
MEDI5117 was associated with suppression of downstream NFkB signaling and lung metastasis. Iliopoulos and colleagues demonstrated that IL6 activation of NF-kB in turn drives further IL6
production, creating an inﬂammatory positive feedback loop (40).
Thus, interrupting this IL6/NF-kB activation loop may be particularly important in some drug-resistant cancers that depend on IL6.
IL6 is known to regulate the growth of some cancer stem cells,
and this may contribute to treatment resistance and relapse (41).
For example, IL6 stimulates the tumorigenic capacity of CSCs
isolated from head and neck squamous tumors (42). Similarly,

glioma stem cells express IL6R, and targeting IL6 decreases glioma
stem cell survival and tumor growth (43). This stimulation of CSC
growth has also been found to contribute to resistance to trastuzumab. Yang, and colleagues reported that resistance of gastric
cancer cells with CSC characteristics to trastuzumab is associated
with activation of an IL6/STAT3/Jagged-1/Notch positive feedback loop (44). The results described in this report extend our
previous ﬁndings (24) by showing that neutralization of IL6 by
MEDI5117 can inhibit CSCs and that this is may contribute to
overcoming trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer. Together
with the enhanced efﬁcacy we observed when paired with other
therapeutics, these results encourage further study of MEDI5117
in combination treatment scenarios and in drug-resistant cancers.
