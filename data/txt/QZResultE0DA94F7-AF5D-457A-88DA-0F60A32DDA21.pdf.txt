Abstract
In human somatotroph adenomas, growth hormone (GH)
hypersecretion can be inhibited by somatostatin analogues
such as octreotide. Unfortunately, serum GH levels reach
normal values in only 60% of treated patients. The decreased
sensitivity to octreotide is strongly related to a lower expression of somatostatin receptor sst2. In this present study, the
sst2 gene was transferred by an adenoviral vector (Ad-sst2) in
human somatotroph (n = 7) and lactotroph (n = 2) adenomas
in vitro. Sst2 mRNA levels and sst2 immunostaining dramatically increased after infection. Ten days after infection at
20 multiplicity of infection (MOI), sst2 gene transfer decreased
cell viability from 19% to 90% by caspase-dependent apoptosis. At low viral doses (5 MOI), Ad-sst2 decreased GH or
prolactin (PRL) basal secretion and mRNA expression.
Somatotroph tumors were classified in three groups according to their octreotide sensitivity. Four days after infection by
5 MOI Ad-sst2, the maximal GH suppression by octreotide
increased from 31% to 57% in the octreotide partially resistant
group and from 0% to 27% in the resistant ones. In the
octreotide-sensitive group, EC50 values significantly decreased
from 1.3  10 11 to 6.6  10 13 mol/L without improving maximal GH suppression. Finally, lactotroph tumors,
nonresponding to octreotide in basal conditions, became
octreotide sensitive with a maximal PRL suppression of 43%
at 10 8 mol/L. Therefore, sst2 reexpression is able to improve
octreotide sensitivity. Sst2 gene transfer may open new theapeutic strategies in treatment combined with somatostatin
analogues. [Cancer Res 2008;68(24):10163–70]

Introduction
Peptide-targeted therapy is a hot topic in Endocrine Oncology,
with strong effect for both diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
The discovery of somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and
lanreotide dramatically modified the treatment of endocrine

tumors, in particular, pituitary and gastroenteropancreatic (GEP)
tumors, through the control of symptoms due to excess hormone
secretion and through the reduction of tumoral volume.
Somatostatin acts by binding five subtypes of G protein–coupled
receptors (GPCR), sst 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 that are widely distributed
throughout many endocrine and nonendocrine tissues. Somatostatin analogues have a good sst2 affinity, 5- to 10-fold lower sst5
affinity, 50-fold lower sst3 affinity, but their affinities for sst1 and
sst4 are not significant (1). The success of in vivo peptide-targeted
therapy is highly dependent on the presence and on the
localization in the tumor of a sufficient amount of the appropriate
receptor. For somatotroph adenomas, we showed that the level
of sst2 expression is correlated with the agonist sensitivity. These
growth hormone (GH)-secreting tumors represent f15% of
pituitary adenomas (2). Often considered as benign, they can
induce serious neurologic and metabolic complications. Serum GH
and insulin-like growth factor I levels under octreotide reach
normal values in only 60% of treated patients (3). Although a strong
correlation exists between the level of sst2 mRNA expression
and the percentage of GH inhibition under octreotide or native
somatostatin (4, 5), no relationship has been observed between
sst5 mRNA level and somatostatin sensitivity (5). In fact, the sst2
receptor is the main receptor mediating somatostatin-induced
inhibition of GH secretion (6, 7).
Lactotroph and somatotroph cells derive from a common
progenitor (8), and the majority of human somatotroph adenomas
are somatolactotroph. Lactotroph adenomas are the most frequent
pituitary tumors. The main pharmacologic treatment of these
prolactin (PRL)-secreting adenomas is dopamine analogues.
However, treatment is ineffective in 10% to 15% of treated patients,
even with the most potent dopamine analogue, cabergoline (9, 10).
Somatostatin receptors sst5, sst1, and sst2 are expressed in these
tumors (11, 12).
Besides the crucial role of sst2 in the response to somatostatin analogue in pituitary and GEP tumors, this receptor is
a potential tumor suppressor gene for nonendocrine pancreatic
adenocarcinoma (13–17). In vitro cell growth and in vivo tumorigenecity were strongly impaired in sst2-negative pancreatic
cancer–derived cell lines genetically modified to express sst2
(13, 15–19). In this model, sst2 reexpression resulted in local
production of somatostatin. Such an autocrine loop was thought
to account for the antitumorigenic effect of sst2 (20). Therefore, besides pharmacologic approaches, gene therapy using
the sst2 gene has been proposed as a potent antitumoral strategy (13).

Cancer Research

Our aim was to introduce the sst2 gene in human somatotroph
and lactotroph tumors by an adenoviral vector to control cell
proliferation and secretion. Sst2 gene transfer was able to decrease
cell viability by caspase-dependent apoptosis. At low viral doses,
this transgene reduced GH and PRL basal oversecretion and
rescued octreotide sensitivity.

Materials and Methods
Pituitary adenomas. The present study was approved by the ethics
committee of the University and was undertaken after informed consent
obtained from each patient and all participants. The study was carried out
in pituitary macroadenomas, 7 somatotroph (A1-A7), and 2 lactotroph
(P1, P2) tumors (Table 1), selected on the basis of clinical hormonal status
and immunocytochemical data.
Cell culture. Fragments of human pituitary adenomas were dissociated
mechanically and enzymatically (21). To eliminate fibroblast, antifibroblast
MicroBeads (Anti-Fibroblast MicroBeads human; Miltenyi Biotec) were used
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Adenoma cells were plated on
24-, 12-, or 4-well dishes (according to the experiment) coated with
extracellular matrix (ECM) of bovine corneal epithelial cells (21). Cells were
cultured in DMEM, depleted in L-Valin (L-Valin was replaced by D-Valin
to block fibroblast proliferation), and supplemented with high glucose
(4,500 mg/mL), 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin
(100 U/mL), and glutamine (100 U/mL). Cells were maintained at 37jC
in an atmosphere containing 7% CO2.
Cell infection. To introduce the sst2 gene, an adenoviral vector was used
because the proliferative rate of human pituitary cells is too weak in vitro
(22) to use classic chemical transfection techniques.
After 24 h of culture, cells were infected with adenoviral vector containing either eGFP gene alone (Ad-eGFP) or mouse sst2 gene (Ad-sst2). Adsst2 vector also independently expressed eGFP. These transgenes were
placed under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. These
vectors were previously described (17). Viral infections were done using
various multiplicities of infection (MOI; from 5–20 MOI) in a final volume of
300 AL of complete medium. In noninfected wells, 300 AL of complete
medium alone was added. Two and half hours after infection, the viral
suspension was replaced by 1 mL of complete culture medium in infected as
well as in noninfected wells. In all experiments, Ad-sst2–infected cells were
compared with Ad-eGFP–infected cells and with noninfected cells.
Flow cytometry analysis. To determine the transduction efficiency of
the adenoviral vectors, fluorescence-activity cell sorting (FACS) analysis was

done. Five days after infection by Ad-eGFP or Ad-sst2, 1  105 cells were
trypsinized and collected in tube containing 800 AL of complete culture
medium with propidium iodide (PI; 0.5 Ag/mL; BD Pharmingen) and run on
FACS sort (Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed with the Cell Quest
program (Becton Dickinson). Ten thousand events were acquired for each
analysis and assayed in duplicate.
RNA extraction and real-time PCR. Sst2, GH, PRL, and somatostatin
mRNA expression were assessed in duplicate using real-time PCR. In brief,
2.5  105 cells per well were plated in 12-well dishes. Four days after
infection, total mRNAs were extracted using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen)
from cells. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA
(cDNA) using 200 IU Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogene)
primed with 300 ng/mL of random hexamer primer, according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The 5¶ exonuclease (Taq man) assay was used to
quantify sst2 mRNA as previously described (23) and to quantify PRL
mRNAs (Hs 00168730-m1; PE Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes used
in sst2 real-time PCR were designed to recognize both hsst2 and msst2. The
amplifications of msst2 and hsst2 plasmid g displayed the same efficiency
(data not shown). The SYBR Green assay purchased from Qiagen was used
to quantify GH (Hs-GH-SG; QuantiTect Primer Assay) and somatostatin
(Hs-SST SG; QuantiTect Primer assay). Forty cycles of two-step PCRannealing extension were performed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence
detection apparatus (PE; Applied Biosystem Paris). The mRNA levels were
normalized to the hglucuronidase (hGus) mRNA levels (23). To produce
standard curves, cDNA constructs were produced for each variable, verified
by sequencing (Beckman Coulter Ceq 8000), and linearized. The results
were expressed as copy of gene/copy of hGus.
Immunocytochemistry. After infection, the expression and localization
of sst2 were assessed by immunocytochemistry. Adenoma cells were
cultured on ECM-coated 14-mm cover glass. Then, cells were infected with
Ad-eGFP or Ad-sst2 at 5 MOI or were not infected. Forty eight hours later,
cells were fixed, counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (1 mg/mL) for 5 min at
room temperature, and incubated overnight at 4jC with an antiserum
against sst2A (SS-800; Gramsch Lab, Germany; ref. 24), diluted at 1:1,000 in
PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The
immunostaining was visualized using Alexa 594–conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) diluted at 1:500 in PBS containing
10% normal goat serum. A peptide fragment of somatostatin receptor
(S-801, Gramsch Lab, Germany) was used to test anti-sst2 specificity.
This peptide was incubated overnight (100 or 1,000) with anti-sst2,
and then cells were incubated with this mix. Confocal image acquisition was performed on a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning microscope, and
image editing was performed using Adobe Photoshop. To quantify sst2

immunostaining, gray scale images were adjusted by a common minimum
and maximum threshold, and the integrated density was measured using
ImageJ (1.40 g software).8
Cell viability. Cell viability was assayed by a luminescent cell viability
assay (CellTiter-Glo; Promega Corporation) using the manufacturer’s
protocol. Each experimental condition was assayed in triplicate wells
containing 5  104 adenoma cells. After 24 d of culture, cells were infected
using various MOI of Ad-eGFP or Ad-sst2 or were not infected. The results
were expressed as mean percentage of cell viability versus noninfected
cells. A direct cell count was also performed on three tumors by a Coulter
apparatus (Beckman-Coulter).
Hormonal release. For hormonal (GH and PRL) release assessment, the
medium of the 5  104 cells noninfected and infected by Ad-eGFP or Adsst2 at 5 MOI was collected at 3, 7, and 10 d after infection and stored frozen
for hormonal measurement. GH and PRL measurements were performed
using commercial immunoradiometric kits (Immunotech Marseille Beckman Coulter). For somatostatin release assessment, the medium of
2.5  105 cells was collected 4 d after infection, and measured after
ethanol extraction using the RIA kit with a sensitivity at 5 pmol/L (EURIAsomatostatin; EURO-DIAGNOSTICA AB).
Cell cycle analysis. For cell cycle distribution analysis, noninfected cells
and cells infected with Ad-eGFP or Ad-sst2 at 20 MOI were harvested
by trypsin treatment 10 d after infection and fixed in ethanol 95% for
30 min on ice. Then, cells were treated with RnaseA (1 mg/mL) for 30 min
at room temperature. DNA was stained with PI (25 Ag/mL), protected
from light before FACS analysis. DNA cell distribution histograms were
analyzed using the CellQuest Pro software program (Becton Dickinson).
Ten thousand events were acquired for each analysis. Each experimental
condition was assayed in triplicate.
Detection of caspase-dependent apoptosis. To determine the
mechanism of cell death, DNA fragmentation was analyzed. Eighty
thousand adenoma cells were plated on ECM-coated 14-mm cover glass.
Cells were infected with Ad-eGFP or Ad-sst2 at 20 MOI. Noninfected cells
were used as control. Six days later, cells were fixed 15 min with
paraformaldehyde. DNA fragmentation was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) using ApopTag
Red In Situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Chemicon International, Inc.).
Each experimental condition was assayed in quadruplicate. Apoptotic
cells were then viewed and scored manually with a Leica/Leitz DMRB
microscope using a PL fluotar 100 objective. The percentage was
evaluated on the basis of >3,000 counted cells in 70 to 120 successive fields.
To evaluate the executioner caspase activities, 5  104 cells were infected
by 20 MOI Ad-eGFP or 20 MOI Ad-sst2 or were not infected. After 6 d,
caspase activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega
Corporation) containing the substrate tetrapeptide sequence DEVD, which
has been shown to be selective for caspases 3 and 7. Each experimental
condition was assayed in triplicate wells. Caspase activity was normalized
to the cell number determined by Celltiter-Glo assay.
Octreotide sensitivity. To assess the octreotide sensitivity, 2  104 cells
per wells were plated in 24-well dishes. After 24 h of culture, cells were
infected with Ad-eGFP or Ad-sst2 at 5 MOI or were not infected. After 3 d,
the effect of various doses of octreotide (1  10 12 to 1  10 8 mol/L) were
tested for their ability to inhibit GH or PRL release over an 8 h period,
in DMEM containing 1% FCS. Moreover, for the 2 prolactinomas, the effect
of a 1  10 9 mol/L dose of cabergoline (provided by Pfizer, Pharmacia &
Upjohn) was tested on the PRL release over an 18-h period. Each condition
was tested in triplicate. Culture medium were then collected and stored
frozen for GH and PRL measurements.
Statistical analysis. The results are presented as the mean F SE. The
statistical significance between two paired groups was determined by the
Wilcoxon nonparametric test, and those between two unpaired groups by
Mann-Whitney nonparametric test or by Student’s t test. To measure the
strength of association between pairs of variables without specifying

dependency, Spearman rank order correlations were run. Differences were
taken to be statistically significant at a probability level of <0.05.

Results
Adenoviral transduction efficiency and sst2 transgene
mRNA and protein expression. The transduction efficiency of
the adenoviral vectors in human pituitary cells in vitro was
evaluated by FACS analysis in four tumors (A1, A3, A7, and P2).
Four days after infection, the mean percentage of eGFP-expressing
cells was 61.1% F 10% and 60.8% F 9% after infection by 5 MOI
Ad-eGFP and 5 MOI Ad-sst2, respectively, and increased up to 99%
at 20 MOI. Moreover, 10 days after infection, eGFP expression was
still present (data not shown). In noninfected cells, no eGFP
expression was detected.
To follow up sst2 transgene expression, sst2 mRNA was
quantified by real-time PCR in 5 MOI Ad-sst2–infected cells,
compared with 5 MOI Ad-eGFP–infected cells and to noninfected
cells (Table 2). Endogenous sst2 mRNA expression was found
in all tumors (Table 2, noninfected) and was not significantly
different from that found in Ad-eGFP–infected cells (mean sst2
mRNA levels, 159 F 46  10 2 and 163 F 46  10 2 copy/copy
hGus, respectively; Table 2). Sst2 mRNA levels dramatically
increased after infection by Ad-sst2 (mean sst2 mRNA level,
14,025 F 4,558  10 2 copy/copy hGus), in a highly variable
manner dependent on each tumor (P < 0.004; Table 2).
The expression of sst2 protein was assessed by immunocytochemical analysis in three tumors (A3, A5, and P1). Forty eight
hours after infection by Ad-sst2 at 5 MOI, the immunofluorescent
staining was clearly more intense in Ad-sst2–infected cells
(Supplementary Data S1 for A5; Fig. 1B for A3 and D for P1) than
in noninfected cells (Supplementary Data S1 for A5; Fig. 1A for
A3 and C for P1) or in cells infected by Ad-eGFP (data not shown).
In tumor A3, the quantification showed a 13-fold in sst2
immunostatining increase after Ad-sst2 infection. The signal
disappeared with sst2 peptide fragment (data not shown). The
weak staining observed in noninfected cells seemed mostly in
the perinucleus golgi area; in contrast, in Ad-sst2–infected cells,
the strong staining was cytoplasmic and at the membrane. These
data clearly showed the transduction efficiency and the transgene
sst2 expression after adenoviral infection.
Sst2 effect on cell viability. To determine whether sst2 transgene affected cell viability, an increasing viral dose (5–20 MOI)
of Ad-eGFP or Ad-sst2 was applied on one somatotroph adenoma (A5). Ten days after infection, cell number was assayed using
indirect estimates of the number of viable cells based on a luminescent cell viability assay. Cell number was lower for Ad-sst2–
infected cells than for Ad-eGFP–infected cells and noninfected cells
at 10 and 20 MOI (P < 0.02; Fig. 2A). Then, a 20 MOI viral dose was
tested on the same somatotroph tumor with cell number
monitoring 3, 7, and 10 days after infection. The mean percentage
of cell number decrease after Ad-sst2 infection versus noninfected
cells was 1.15% F 0.77%, 18.85% F 9.2% (P < 0.01), and 37.65% F
2% (P < 0.001) at 3, 7, and 10 days after infection, respectively.
According to these data, the effect of a 20 MOI viral dose was
analyzed on cell viability of the six other somatotroph and the two
lactotroph tumors, at day 10 after infection. In all cases, Ad-sst2
infection significantly decreased the cell number (P < 0.008;
Fig. 2B). The percentage of cell number decrease versus noninfected cells varied from 19.1% F 0.14% to 90% F 4.5% without correlation with the increase in sst2 mRNA level. Again, no

significant effect was observed after Ad-eGFP transduction. Direct
cell counts on three adenomas (A3, A6, and P2) in the same experimental conditions of infection yielded similar results (Supplementary Data S2). These data underlined the clearly negative effect
of Ad-sst2 infection on cell viability of pituitary adenoma in vitro.
Sst2 proapoptotic effect involving executioner caspase.
To determine the mechanism by which sst2 transgene induced a
negative effect on cell viability, somatotroph cells transduced by

20 MOI Ad-eGFP or 20 MOI Ad-sst2 and noninfected cells were
examined using flow cytometry methods after undergoing DNA
staining with PI (Fig. 2C). Ten days after infection, the percentages
of cells in G1-S and in G2-M phase were slightly affected by Ad-sst2
transduction, whereas those in subdiploid sub-G1 phase (representing cell death) markedly increased (Fig. 2C). The percentage of
cells in each phase of cell cycle was highly similar for noninfected
cells and Ad-eGFP–infected cells. To confirm the apoptosis induced
by sst2 overexpression, DNA fragmentation was investigated using
TUNEL assay 6 days after infection at 20 MOI. A larger number of
apoptotic events per field occurred in cells transduced by Ad-sst2
(mean of apoptotic events, 4.02 F 0.35 versus 0.86 F 0.16 in
Ad-eGFP–infected cells; P < 0.001; Fig. 2D, left). In noninfected
(data not shown), and in Ad-eGFP–infected cells, the number of
apoptotic events observed was similar.
Finally, the apoptotic effect of sst2 was investigated by
measuring the activity of executioner caspase, 6 days after Adsst2 infection. In same experimental conditions as above, Ad-sst2
infection increased the basal caspase activity (noninfected cells)
5-fold, but no significant effect was observed after Ad-eGFP infection (Fig. 2D, right).
Sst2 effect on hormonal basal secretion and expression.
Four days after infection at 5 MOI (a viral dose without effect on
cell viability), Ad-sst2–infected cells presented a significant
decrease in GH or in PRL mRNA levels in three tested tumors
(A2, A3, and P1). The mean percentages of GH or PRL mRNAs
decrease versus noninfected cells were, respectively, 48.7 F 21%
in somatotroph tumors and 36% F 18% in the lactotroph one,
whereas no significant effect was observed in Ad-eGFP–infected

cells (10.6% F 9% and 9.5 F 34%, respectively). The decrease in
hormonal mRNA expression was associated with an inhibition in
hormonal release as presented in Fig. 3 for the three tumors.
The mean percentages of hormone inhibition versus noninfected
cells were 40% F 23% for GH and 52% F 10% for PRL at 10 d after
Ad-sst2 infection. GH and PRL release in the medium of Ad-eGFP–
infected cells and in the medium of noninfected cells was similar.
These data showed that sst2 transgene overexpression alone produced an inhibitory effect on both secretion and expression of GH
and PRL.
Sst2 effect seemed independent of somatostatin expression
and release. Somatostatin mRNA expression was measured by
real-time PCR in the cultured cells from all tumors. The basal
expression level of somatostatin was very low in the 9 tumors and
was not modified by sst2 infection (the mean somatostatin mRNA
levels were 0.2 F 0.2  10 2, 0.7 F 0.8  10 2, and 0.3 F 0.3  10 2
copy/copy hGus for noninfected cells, Ad-eGFP–infected cells, and
Ad-sst2–infected cells, respectively). Moreover, the basal release of
endogenous somatostatin was assayed in the culture medium
of cells infected by 5 or 20 MOI of Ad-sst2 or Ad-eGFP and of
noninfected cells. The somatostatin levels were undetectable
(below 5 pmol/L) in all conditions.

groups: sensitive (A1 and A2), partially resistant (A3, A4), and
resistant tumors (A5, A6, and A7) with a mean percentage of
GH inhibition by octreotide of 32.5% F 3.5%, 10% F 6%, and
0.6% F 1.5%, respectively. The effect of Ad-sst2 infection was then
analyzed on the hormonal secretion under octreotide treatment.
A dose-response hormonal suppression curve was assessed in the
7 somatotroph and in the 2 lactotroph tumors, 4 days after infection at 5 MOI (by Ad-sst2 or Ad-eGFP) and in noninfected cells.
In each tumor, the dose-related hormonal suppression was similar
for Ad-eGFP–infected cells and noninfected cells. In the octreotide partially resistant group, the maximal GH suppression under
octreotide increased significantly from 31% F 9% for Ad-eGFP–
infected cells to 57% F 14% for Ad-sst2–infected cells (P < 0.05;
Fig. 4B). Moreover, the dose-related curve of GH suppression
was displaced on the left for Ad-sst2–infected cells versus
Ad-eGFP–infected cells or noninfected cells (EC50, 6.7  10 10
versus 2.3  10 11 mol/L). The completely resistant somatotroph
tumors became partially sensitive to octreotide after Ad-sst2
infection with a maximal hormonal suppression of 27% F 7% at
10 10 mol/L (P < 0.05; Fig. 4C). In the octreotide sensitive somatotroph tumors, the maximal GH suppression was similar in the
Ad-sst2, Ad-eGFP, and noninfected cells. However, the octreotide
showed efficacy at lower concentrations, as shown by a lower

respond to octreotide in basal conditions, became responsive to
octreotide after Ad-sst2 infection with a maximal PRL suppression
of 43.4% F 7%; this PRL suppression was close to that obtained
with dopamine analogue (PRL suppression under 10 9 mol/L of
cabergoline, 52% F 5%, Fig. 4D).

Discussion
In human somatotroph tumors, somatostatin-resistant tumors
are the biggest and the most aggressive (25), suggesting that the
loss of sst2 expression may confer these tumors a growth advantage.
In this study, we showed that sst2 gene transfer alone induced a
strong decrease in cell viability of human somatotroph and lactotroph adenomatous cells in vitro. It is well-known that somatostatin
and its analogues may trigger antiproliferative signaling through
cytostatic (growth arrest) and cytotoxic (apoptosis) effects in somatotroph cells (26–28). In our experimental conditions, the cell cycle
analysis revealed that the main process in cell viability inhibition
was cell death referring to the increase in sub-G1 population. Only
a slight but not significant reduction of the proportion of cells

present in G2-M fraction was observed under sst2 overexpression.
The weakness of sst2 effect in G2-M phase probably results from
the weak proliferative potential of human adenoma cells in vitro (22).
The TUNEL analysis confirmed the DNA damage involving the
executioner caspase activation. In other cellular models such as
pancreatic cancer cells, several arguments favor the sst2 role as a
tumor suppressor (29). In these cells, the apoptotic effect of sst2
involved both death ligand and mitochondrial pathways (30), both
of which remain to be explored in our pituitary models.
In the pancreatic model, the tumor suppressor effects of sst2 are
based on an sst2-activated autocrine loop; transfection of sst2 in
cells lacking this receptor induces expression of its own ligand
somatostatin, which in turn constitutively activates sst2 (13, 16).
Moreover, disruption of this autocrine loop by RNA interference
reversed sst2 antitumoral activity (20). However, in our experimental conditions, somatostatin immunoreativity was not detected
in the medium of human pituitary cell culture, although the sensitivity of the method was 5 pmol/L. According to previous works,
somatostatin basal secretion can be achieved at a level 1,000-fold
lower than the GH secretion basal level (31), which, in our culture
conditions, could account for 60 nmol/L. In fact, only a very weak

sst2 Gene Transfer in Human Pituitary Adenomas

expression of somatostatin mRNA was detected by Q-PCR in
human pituitary cells in our experimental conditions. This expression was not modified at all by sst2 transduction. In agreement
with our results, no somatostatin immunoreactivity was detected
in the hamster pancreatic tumors bearing sst2, although the
antitumorigenic effect was clear (15). Our data suggest a ligandindependent sst2 effect, i.e., a receptor constitutive activation.
Very recently, using a small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) approach, BenShlomo and colleagues (32) showed sst2, sst3, and sst5 had a
ligand-independent receptor-constitutive action. Under selective
sst2, sst3, or sst5 siRNAs, the basal levels of cyclic AMP, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, and adrenocorticorticotropic hormone secretion increased in the AtT-20
corticotroph cell line. In our study, the dramatic increase in sst2
mRNA levels after Ad-sst2 infection may favor receptor homodimerization. Independently or dependently relative to homodimerization, sst2 overexpression may trigger signal transduction
pathways without external signal. The concept of constitutively
active GPCR is now firmly rooted in receptor pharmacology, as
revealed by the inverse agonists discovered for many receptors (33).
Independently of cell death, at low viral doses, we showed that
sst2 transgene induced a decline of hormonal basal secretion after
infection. This effect was associated with a decrease in GH and PRL
expression. The inhibitory effect of sst2 gene transfer was obtained
by using viral doses 2- to 4-fold lower than those used for cell death
effects. This suggests different signal transduction pathways
are involved for antihormonal and antitumoral effects. Moreover,
note that Ad-sst2 was able to decrease cell viability even in somatotroph octreotide resistant tumors for which GH basal secretion
was unchanged under octreotide (as A5, A6, and A7). Again,
this suggests there is a partition between transduction pathways
involved in cell death process and those activated during GH
secretion inhibition by octreotide. In GH-secreting adenomas,
somatostatin analogues produce their apoptotic action in a phos-

phatase-dependent manner (27), whereas the somatostatin inhibition of hormone secretion depends on the inhibition of adenylate
cyclase and/or the regulation of ion channels (34).
For the first time, we show that the reinduction of sst2 expression is able to restore the octreotide response of partially resistant
somatotroph tumor. The maximal inhibitory effect under octreotide
increased significantly after Ad-sst2 infection, whereas the EC50
became 10-fold lower. Therefore, the in vitro dose response curves
of these tumors became similar to those of tumors sensitive to
octreotide in vivo (5, 25). These data point out the crucial role of sst2
in the capacity of the tumor to respond to octreotide. In the octreotide sensitive group, octreotide was efficient at lower concentrations
after Ad-sst2 infection without increasing the maximal inhibition.
In the octreotide fully resistant group, a partial restoration of
octreotide sensitivity was observed; the pattern of response become
close to that of partially sensitive tumors. The sst2 expression and
cellular sst2 localization did not differ for partially resistant and
resistant tumors (Supplementary Data S1). One may therefore hypothesize alterations occur in the transduction pathways downstream
from the receptor. It has already been proposed that somatostatin
postreceptor alterations occur in human somatotroph adenomas
(4, 35). For octreotide resistant tumors, it has been shown that there is
a coordinated decrease in expressions of several genes coding for
proteins implicated in the processes of differentiation and secretion
of somatotroph cells (4). Similarly, for human dopamine–resistant
prolactinomas, we have previously showed expression is decreased
for the messengers coding for Gai2 and Pit-1, proteins downstream
from the D2 dopamine receptor in the transduction pathways (36, 37).
Prolactinoma tumors do not usually respond to octreotide (12).
Induced sst2 expression allowed octreotide to be fully effective in
this type of tumors. However, PRL suppression by octreotide did
not exceed that by dopamine. The difference in the restoration
of octreotide sensitivity between the two prolactinomas, and the
three GH octreotide resistant tumors suggests the transduction

pathways triggered by this peptide are present in prolactinomas
but might be modified in GH octreotide–resistant tumors.
In conclusion, sst2 overexpression induced cell death of human
somatotroph and lactotroph tumoral cells. Our data suggest
this receptor has an intrinsic activity. Thus, the loss of sst2
expression during pituitary tumorigenesis could play a role in the
deregulation of cell growth and hormonal secretion not only by
the suppression of somatostatin-induced inhibitory signaling but
also by the loss of sst2 itself, which can thus be considered
a suppressor gene in this study. Moreover, sst2 re-expression is able
to rescue the octreotide sensitivity at low viral charge.
It could be hazardous to translate these in vitro data to the
in vivo conditions. Moreover the studies on pituitary gene therapy
is still at an early stage. Because the adenoviral vectors used in this
study can elicit severe inflammatory responses (38), concerns have
been raised about the safety of using the first generation of such
adenoviral vectors. Nevertheless, with a more appropriate vector,
our data may position sst2 as a new candidate for gene therapy for
pituitary tumors but also for a wide number of tumors. In new
