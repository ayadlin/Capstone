Abstract
Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most prevalent
diseases worldwide. Atherosclerosis was considered to be the single most important
contributor to CAD. In this study, a distinct serum protein expression pattern in
CAD patients was demonstrated by proteomic analysis with two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. In particular, CDK9 was found to
be highly elevated in serum, monocytes and artery plaque samples of CAD patients.
Furthermore, there was high infiltration of CD14+ monocytes/macrophages within
artery plaques correlated with the expression of CDK9. Moreover, Flavopiridol (CDK9
inhibitor) could inhibit THP-1 cell (monocytic acute leukemia cell line) proliferation by
targeting CDK9. Altogether, These findings indicate that CDK9 represent an important
role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. It may be a potential
biomarker of atherosclerotic inflammation and offer insights into the pathophysiology
and targeted therapy for atherosclerotic CAD.

INTRODUCTION

Nonetheless, there were fewer researches for CDK9 in the
atherosclerotic inflammation or atherosclerotic CAD.
In our previous study (unpublished data), results
of the 2-D proteomics analysis revealed that CDK9
was highly expressed in the serum of patients with
atherosclerotic CAD. Herein, the aim of this study was
to analyze the expression levels of CDK9 in serum,
monocytes, and plaque samples of atherosclerotic CAD
patients and to explore the possible benefits in the
prognosis and treatment of atherosclerotic CAD.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality and has an increasing incidence
worldwide [1]. Atherosclerosis was traditionally considered
a metabolic disease characterized by the accumulation
of lipids and fibrous elements in the large arteries, and
constituted the single most important contributor to
CAD [2, 3]. In the current view, accumulating evidences
support a critical role for inflammation in the pathogenesis
of atherosclerosis. Several studies have demonstrated
that C-reactive protein [4, 5], B-type natriuretic peptide
(NT-pro-BNP) [6], and serum cardiac troponin I (cTN-I)
[7] as robust serum biomarkers for CAD risk.
Recent studies [8–10] have demonstrated that
cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) plays a crucial
role in regulation of the cell cycle and monitoring the
activation of primary inflammatory response genes. An
increasing number of inhibitors, such as flavopiridol
(FLA), have developed towards therapeutic applications
in cancer and inflammation by targeting CDK9 [11–13].

RESULTS
Proteomic analysis of serum samples of
atherosclerotic CAD patients and healthy controls
To identify aberrant serum proteins during
atherosclerosis, we compared serum samples from
atherosclerotic CAD patients and healthy control subjects.

the two sample types. Spot analysis using 2-D PDQuest
(Bio-Rad) detected 509 ± 31 spots per patient sample
(Figure 1A) and 565 ± 29 spots per healthy control sample
(Figure  1B). The protein expression was considered to
have changed if the percentage volume of its spots on the
gels showed a two-fold or greater difference (P < 0.05).
Thirty-three differentially expressed proteins between
the atherosclerotic CAD patient and healthy control were
excised from the 2-D gels, digested in the gel and applied
to a sample template for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
Twenty-seven protein spots were successfully identified
with Mascot using peptide mass fingerprinting data. The
protein names, NCBI accession numbers, theoretical
molecular weight and pI values were shown in Table 1.
Among 27 proteins identified, 15 of them, including
CDK9, were increased, whereas 12 proteins were
decreased in atherosclerotic serum samples.
All 27 identified proteins were further classified
into 6 different groups based on cell proliferation and
apoptosis, inflammation factor, immune factor, energy
metabolism and signaling pathway according to known or
postulated functions and pathways (Table 2). CDK9 is the
following emphasis of this study.

2.2-fold CDK9 increase in atherosclerotic serum samples
measured with ELISA (P < 0.05, vs. Controls). Their
characteristics (including proteomic analysis samples) are
summarized in Supplementary Table S1.

Validation of CDK9 expression in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
We isolated PBMCs from atherosclerotic patients
and healthy controls to measure CDK9 expression. As
shown in Figure  3A and 3B, both mRNA and protein
levels of CDK9 were found to be significantly increased
in PBMCs of atherosclerotic patients compared with
healthy controls. In addition, CDK9 was higher expressed
in monocyte subpopulations than in lymphocyte
subpopulations in PBMCs of atherosclerotic patients
compared with healthy controls (P < 0.01, Figure 3C).

CDK9 expression in atherosclerotic plaques
In order to further investigate whether CDK9 was
increased in atherosclerotic process, artery plaque tissue
sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining.
As shown in Figure  4 (and Supplementary Figure  1),
compared with non-plaque tissue, plaque tissue showed
irregular intimal thickening, calcification, and significant
atherosclerotic plaque formation, along with infiltration of
abundant inflammatory cells. CDK9 positive expression
was found in atherosclerotic plaque intima mainly located
within nucleus. Furthermore, the CD14 (monocyte/
macrophage surface marker) immunohistochemistry

Validation of CDK9 expression
in serum samples
As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, CDK9 expression
was found to be significantly increased in atherosclerotic
patients compared with those in healthy controls
(P < 0.01) in Western blotting assays. Figure 2C showed a

staining showed positive staining within atherosclerotic

infiltration cells. Moreover, the CD14+ cells showed
increased CDK9 levels in atherosclerotic plaques, which
indicated the role of CDK9 in monocyte infiltration during
atherosclerosis.

(human monocytic acute leukemia cell line). As shown
in Figure  5A and 5B, CDK9 protein expression was
decreased with FLA (100 nM) treatment combined with
TNFα (50 ng/mL) stimulation for 6 h and 24 h.
To study the significance of the FLA-dependent
suppression of CDK9 expression, THP-1 cells were
treated with FLA (50 or 100 nM) combined with TNFα
stimulation in CCK-8 assays. The dose of 100 nM FLA
showed an apparent inhibitory effect at either 6 h or 24 h of
TNFα-stimulated proliferation (Figure 5C). To determine
the effect of CDK9 on monocyte apoptosis, flow cytometry
analysis of THP-1 cells was performed with Annexin
V-PI staining. As shown in Figure 5D and 5E, both the
percentages of early and late apoptosis were significantly

Inhibition of CDK9 expression by FLA in
THP-1 cells
Because CDK9 was significantly increased in

increased with FLA (100 nM) treatment combined with
TNFα (50  ng/mL) stimulation. This result confirmed
that FLA inhibits gene expression and potentiates tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis.
In addition, we examined the cell cycle after FLA
(100 nM) treatment with flow cytometry. As shown in
Supplementary Figure  2, FLA treatment for 6  h might
cause G2/M arrest (the percentage of G2/M cells from
10.9% to 12.6%). FLA treatment increased the percentage
of G2/M cells to 15.2% under TNFα stimulation.
However, there was no significant difference detected
between groups for the percentage of cells in G0/G1 or
S phase.

CDK9 and cyclin T1 [17, 18]. Of note, dysfunctions in the
CDK9-related pathway are related with several forms of
human tumors [15, 19–24]. In addition, the roles of CDK9
in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and
cardiac hypertrophy have been reported [25–27].
Increasing evidences have shown that CDK9 is
increased in activated lymphocytes, which has a critical
role in inflammatory disorders [28–30]. In the present
study, a distinct serum protein expression pattern in
atherosclerotic CAD patients was demonstrated. In
particular, CDK9 was found to be highly elevated
in serum, monocytes and artery plaque samples of
atherosclerotic CAD patients. Furthermore, there was
high infiltration of CD14+ monocytes/macrophages within
artery plaques correlated with the expression of CDK9.
These findings indicated that CDK9  might represent
an important role for inflammation in the pathogenesis
of atherosclerosis. It may be a potential biomarker of
atherosclerotic inflammation and provide incremental
information regarding the prediction of CAD besides
traditional risk factors. We merit further investigation
of CDK9 measurement in various clinical situations for
identifying coronary atherosclerosis.

DISCUSSION
The hallmark of the cyclin-dependent kinase is
its ability to modulate cell cycle [14–16]. The member
of the family, CDK9, was discovered by its ability
involved in the control of gene transcription. The positive
transcriptional elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which
regulates the elongation phase of RNA-polymerase
II-dependent transcription, is a heterodimer composed of

In recent years, the anti-inflammatory effects of
CDK9 inhibitors have been linked to its inhibition of
cellular proliferation and induction of immune cell death
[31]. Among these CDK9 inhibitors, FLA has shown
a preference for inhibition of CDK9 over other CDKs
[31]. FLA is an ATP analog that preferentially inhibits
CDK9 kinase activity by a high-affinity interaction
with its ATP-binding pocket [32]. FLA significantly
inhibits inflammatory processes, such as dosedependent murine collagen-induced arthritis [10, 33];
murine hepatitis induced by concanavalin A [34] and
catabolic effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on
cartilage [35]. Our result showed that in THP-1 cells,
FLA suppressed CDK9 expression, caused inhibition of
proliferation and potentiation of TNFα induced apoptosis
[36], demonstrated that FLA could inhibit THP-1 cell
proliferation by targeting CDK9. But, it still needs
many works to investigate possibility for the therapy of
atherosclerotic CAD via CDK9 target.

to the manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatant was
subsequently collected and used for 2-D electrophoresis.
Approximately 300 µg of protein was suspended in a
rehydration solution (8 M urea, 2% CHAPS, 65 mM
DTT, 0.2% pharmalyte [pH range 3–10] and 0.2%
bromphenol blue) and applied to 18 cm pH 3–10  nonlinear Immobiline™ DryStrip Gels (GE Healthcare BioSciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) for isoelectrofocusing
[37]. The isoelectrofocusing was performed using an Ettan
IPGphor™ Instrument (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences), and
proteins in the IPG strips were subsequently placed on
a 12% uniform SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were
silver-stained and scanned with an Image Scanner in
transmission mode, after which the image analysis was
undertaken using 2-D PDQuest (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA).

In-gel digestion and mass spetrometry analysis
The in-gel digestion of proteins for mass
spectrometry analysis has been reported previously
[37]. Peptide mass analysis was performed using an
AB4800 MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) after dissolving the
tryptic peptide mixture with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. The
mass spectra were externally calibrated with a peptide
standard from Applied Biosystems. Based on NCBI
human databases, the mass spectra were analyzed with a
50 ppm mass tolerance by using GPS Explorer version
2.0.1 and Mascot version 1.9.

CONCLUSION
CDK9 was found to be highly elevated in serum,
monocytes and artery plaque samples of atherosclerotic
CAD patients. Also, there was high infiltration of CD14+
monocytes/macrophages within artery plaques correlated
with the expression of CDK9. This indicated that
CDK9 might be a potential biomarker of atherosclerotic
inflammation and offer insights into the pathophysiology
and targeted therapy for atherosclerotic CAD.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
separation

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population

Whole blood samples were collected from
atherosclerotic CAD patients and healthy control groups.
The blood was aspirated into sterile glass tubes with
sodium citrate as an anticoagulant to facilitate PBMCs
separation by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation.
Cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline to
remove residual platelets. The remaining aliquot (200 μL)
was placed into a microcentrifuge tube, frozen and kept
at −80°C. The cold aggregation method was used with
certain modifications to further separate the monocytes
and lymphocytes [38]. Purity of the isolated monocytes
was 90–95% as defined by flow cytometry with CD14+
staining.

Forty-three atherosclerotic CAD patients with
symptoms of angina pectoris were included in the study
after angiographic documentation of CAD from Qilu
Hospital of Shandong University. Thirty-eight healthy
volunteers without any evidence of atherosclerosis,
CAD, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus
or inflammatory disorders were enrolled from Jinan,
Shandong Province, China and were used as the control
group. This study was conducted in agreement with the
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Human
Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine, Shandong
University.

RNA isolation and RT-PCR

Serum collection, protein extracts and 2-D
electrophoresis

Total RNA was extracted from isolated PBMCs,
lymphocytes and monocytes using the RNeasy Mini
spin column kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
RT-PCR was performed using the PrimeScript One
Step RT-PCR kit version 2 (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan).

An aliquot of 5  mL from each peripheral blood
sample was separated into serum fractions by
centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Serum protein
was harvested with the Albumin and IgG Removal Kit
(Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) according

tissue sections were performed according to standard
procedures. Sections for immunohistochemistry staining
were blocked sequentially with 3% hydrogen peroxide
for 10 min and, 10% normal serum matching the host of
the secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature.
Primary antibody against human CDK9 (1:800 dilution) or
against human CD14 (1:100 dilution) was used. Later on,
a standard rapid EnVision technique (REAL™ EnVision™
Detection System, Peroxidase/DAB+, Rabbit/Mouse,
Code K5007, Dako, Denmark) was used to detect the
protein conjugates and develop the color. The slides were
viewed under 100 ×, 200 × and 400 × magnifications to
define subcellular localization of the CDK9 and CD14.
