BACKGROUND: In postmarketing surveillance, the US Food and Drug Administration has reported the development of lung masses,
thyroid cancer, and skin cancer after amiodarone therapy. METHODS: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research database,
the authors conducted a population-based cohort study. Patients who were treated with amiodarone between 1997 and 2008 were
enrolled. Those with antecedent cancer were excluded. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of cancers were calculated to compare
the cancer incidence of the study cohort with that of the general population. A multivariate Cox regression model was used to
evaluate the association between cumulative defined daily doses (cDDDs) of amiodarone and cancer occurrence. RESULTS: The study
included 6418 subjects, with a median follow-up of 2.57 years. A total of 280 patients developed cancer. The risk of cancer increased
with borderline significance (SIR, 1.12; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.99-1.26 [P ¼ .067]). Male patients had a higher risk
(SIR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.36 [P ¼ .022]). The total cohort of patients and the male patients with > 180 cDDDs within the first year were
found to have SIRs of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.00-1.61; P ¼ .046) and 1.46 (95% CI, 1.11-1.89; P ¼ .008), respectively. After adjustment for
age, sex, and comorbidities, the hazards ratio was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.22-3.22; P ¼ .006) for the high tertile of cDDDs compared with the
low tertile. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicate that amiodarone may be associated with an increased

INTRODUCTION
Amiodarone, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of arrhythmias in 1985, is
an antiarrhythmic drug used for the treatment of tachyarrhythmias. Because amiodarone is fat-soluble and its elimination
half-life is very long (53 days),1 large amounts of the drug can accumulate in the soft tissues after long-term treatment. In
addition, the structure of amiodarone is very similar to that of thyroxine, and therefore thyroid function abnormalities are
common during its administration. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can occur after treatment with amiodarone.2 To the best of our knowledge, the most serious reaction caused by amiodarone therapy is pulmonary toxicity, which
can result in pulmonary fibrosis. Long-term treatment with amiodarone is also associated with blue-gray hyperpigmentation and photosensitivity of the skin.3 In animal studies, amiodarone has been reported to increase the risk of thyroid
tumors in rats.4 In postmarketing surveillance, the Food and Drug Administration reported the development of lung
masses, thyroid cancer, and skin cancer after treatment with amiodarone.5 Some case reports indicated that amiodarone
might increase the risk of pulmonary masses,6-12 thyroid cancer,13-15 and skin cancer.16-19 In addition, a meta-analysis of
randomized trials unexpectedly revealed a borderline significant increase in cancer mortality among patients assigned to
the amiodarone group. However, to the best of our knowledge, no large-scale study to date has addressed this issue. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to determine whether the use of amiodarone is associated with an increased
risk of cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Cohort

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January
1, 1996 to December 31, 2008 using the National Health
Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan.
Patients who received amiodarone for  28 days between
January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2008 were enrolled.
Patients aged < 20 years or those with antecedent malignancies were excluded. Information regarding comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease,
heart failure, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dysrhythmia, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism, was collected for analysis. Data regarding monthly income levels
were collected as a surrogate of socioeconomic status. We
also gathered information concerning urbanization levels
of the residential area.
Data Source

The National Health Insurance (NHI) program is a mandatory general health insurance program offering complete medical care coverage to all Taiwanese residents,
with a coverage rate of up to 98% since 1995.20 The NHI
program covers inpatient, outpatient, and emergency
care, as well as traditional Chinese medicine, dental services, and prescription medication. The NHIRD is managed, filed, and publicly released by the National Health
Research Institutes (NHRI) in Taiwan. Personal information that could identify an individual patient is encrypted.
The Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, a subset of
the NHIRD, is a representative database of 1,000,000
patients randomly sampled from the registry of all NHI
enrollees by the NHRI. The NHI Catastrophic Illness
Registry is a subset of the NHIRD that can provide comprehensive information regarding all patients with severe
diseases, including catastrophic illnesses such as cancer,
who have been exempted from copayment under the NHI
program. The confidentiality of the data abides by the data
regulations of the NHI Bureau and the NHRI. Because the
NHI data set consists of deidentified secondary data for
research purposes, the current study was exempt from full
review by the Institutional Review Board.
Outcomes

The endpoint of the current study was cancer occurrence.
The Catastrophic Illness Registry was used to identify
patients who were diagnosed with cancer. Pathohistological confirmation is required for a diagnosis of cancer to be
reported in the Catastrophic Illness Registry. The patients
who were treated with amiodarone were followed until
1700

the occurrence of cancer, dropout from the NHI program,
death, or the end of 2008.
Statistical Analysis

The risk of cancer among the amiodarone-treated cohort
was determined with the standardized incidence ratio
(SIR), which is defined as the observed number of cancer
cases divided by the expected number. The expected number of cancer cases was calculated by multiplying the
national incidence rate of cancers according to age (in 5year intervals), sex, and calendar year by the corresponding stratum-specific person-time accrued in the cohort.
The incidence rates of cancers among the general population were acquired from the Taiwan Cancer Registry. The
cancer registry in Taiwan was initiated in 1979 and therefore the entire follow-up of the study cohort was under
the coverage of the registry. The 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs) for the SIRs were estimated under the assumption that the observed number of cancers followed a Poisson probability distribution. We determined the SIRs for
the subgroups according to sex and age group. Because
the cancer incidence most likely would be inflated in the
first year due to the surveillance bias, a subgroup analysis
stratified by the duration of enrollment (0-1 years, 1-5
years, and  5 years) was performed. To determine
whether amiodarone was associated with specific types of
malignancies, we also calculated the SIRs for each cancer
site. Because there is likely a latent period of at least 2 years
between exposure and the development of clinically significant cancer,21 we calculated the cumulative defined
daily doses (cDDDs) of amiodarone within the first year
and estimated the SIRs 3 years after enrollment for
patients with high (> 180) and low ( 180) cDDDs to
determine whether a dose-effect exists.
We used univariate and multivariate backward conditional Cox proportional hazards models to analyze the
correlation between the cDDDs and cancer, and to identify predictors of cancer development among patients
receiving amiodarone. Risk factors with a P value < .1
were entered into the multivariate analysis. Only the
cDDD within the first year was calculated and the persontime within the first year was excluded to avoid immortal
time bias.22 In other words, we redefined time 0 as being
1 year after the initial treatment with amiodarone.
Accordingly, we excluded patients with a follow-up of <
1 year from the survival analysis. The cDDD was treated
as a time-dependent covariate, with a lag time of 2 years
(ie, the exposure had no effect in the first 2 years). We also
tried using different models that incorporated > 180
cDDDs versus  180; > 90 cDDDs versus  90; or

cDDDs of low, intermediate, and high levels (with cutoff
points at the 33.3rd and 66.7th percentiles). KaplanMeier analysis and the log-rank test were performed to
evaluate the time trend and test the difference in cumulative incidence among patients with low, intermediate, and
high cDDDs. The person-time and events within the first
year were excluded to avoid immortal time bias. Interactions between variables were tested by entering multiplicative interaction terms into the model.
Extraction and computation of data were performed
using the Perl programming language (version 5.12.2;
Perl Foundation, Walnut, Calif). Microsoft SQL Server
2005 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash) was
used for data linkage, processing, and sampling. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistical
software (version 19.0 for Windows; IBM Corporation,
New York, NY). A P value < .05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the Study Population

We identified 6851 patients who were treated with amiodarone. Of these, 433 patients had antecedent malignancies
and therefore were excluded; the final study cohort consisted of 6418 patients, 42.8% of whom were female. In
total, the cohort was observed for 21,684.4 person-years
from 1997 to 2008. The median follow-up was 2.57 years
(interquartile range [IQR], 0.78 years-5.25 years). The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 70
years (IQR, 60 years-78 years). The demographic data and
comorbidities of the cohort are shown in Table 1.
External Analysis

During the observation interval, 280 cancers developed.
Compared with the general population, patients who
received amiodarone had a borderline significant increase
in their overall risk of cancer (SIR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.991.26 [P ¼ .067]).
The risk of all cancers was found to be significantly
increased in men (SIR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.36 [P ¼
.022]) but not in women (SIR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.79-1.23).
In the subgroup analysis performed according to age (20
years-59 years, 60 years-79 years, and  80 years), the
SIRs were not significantly different from unity, except for
those of male patients aged 20 years to 59 years (SIR, 1.67;
95% CI, 1.07-2.48 [P ¼ .025]) and  80 years (SIR,
1.41; 95% CI, 1.07-1.83 [P ¼ .016]). The incidence of
cancer was increased within 1 year of amiodarone therapy
(SIR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05-1.64 [P ¼ .002]), but not after 1
year (SIR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89-1.18). At 3 years after

enrollment, the SIRs for patients with > 180 cDDDs
increased significantly among the total number of patients
and among the male patients, with SIRs of 1.28 (95% CI,
1.00-1.61; P ¼ .046) and 1.46 (95% CI, 1.11-1.89; P ¼
.008), respectively. In contrast, patients with  180
cDDDs did not appear to have a higher risk of developing
cancer compared with the general population. The results
of the subgroup analysis are summarized in Table 2.
There were no significant differences noted with
regard to incidence for any of the specific cancer types,
including lung and mediastinum (44 observed cases vs
39.41 expected cases; SIR, 1.12 [95%, CI, 0.81-1.50]),
thyroid cancer (1 observed case vs 1.94 expected cases;
SIR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.01-2.87]), or skin cancer (6
observed cases vs 5.99 expected cases; SIR, 1.00 [95% CI,
0.37-2.18]). The SIRs of specific cancer sites are summarized in Table 3. The cancer incidences of each site were
not found to be significantly different from those of the
general population after the exclusion of person-time and
events within the first 1 or 3 years (data not shown).

male sex (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38-2.62 [P < .001]), cirrhosis (HR, 3.70; 95% CI, 2.10-6.52 [P < .001]), socioeconomic status, and cDDD (HR, 1.001 for 1 additional
daily dose; 95% CI, 1.000-1.002 [P ¼ .022]) were found

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first
large, population-based, cohort study to evaluate the risk of
cancer among patients treated with amiodarone. We found
that there was a borderline significantly increased risk of
cancer among patients who received amiodarone compared
with the general population. Patients either of male sex or
those with > 180 cDDDs within the first year had a significantly higher risk of developing cancer, and those with
both factors had an even greater SIR of 1.46 (P ¼ .008).
The dose-effect was also confirmed with the multivariate
Cox regression model, which demonstrated an adjusted
HR of 1.97 (P ¼ .006) when comparing the incidences in
patients with cDDDs in the high and low tertiles.
Our research design, which included an unbiased
subject selection, strict amiodarone regimen, and SIR estimations matched with patient age, sex, and calendar year
of treatment, supported the validity of these findings.
Amiodarone therapy requires complete clinical and electrocardiographic assessments. Because participation in the
NHI is mandatory, and all Taiwanese residents can access
medical care with low copayments, the follow-up is complete with what to our knowledge is the lowest referral
bias reported to date. Pathologic proof of malignancy is
necessary to apply for a cancer catastrophic illness certificate. Laboratory and imaging data must also be supplied
for the peer review. In addition, a patient with a certificate
of catastrophic illness is free from related medical costs,
especially hospital expenses. Therefore, data regarding

treatment with amiodarone and the diagnosis of cancer in
the current study were not only reliable but also
exhaustive.
Amiodarone-related adverse effects and toxicity
occur in multiple organ systems, especially the thyroid,
lung, skin, and liver. Although mutagenicity studies concerning amiodarone were negative, an animal study
revealed its potential carcinogenicity.4,5 In addition, amiodarone has been reported to enhance the effects of radiation on the skin and mucosa,23 and thus possibly
accentuate the effects of radiation carcinogenesis. Several
case reports have shown evidence of a plausible correlation
between amiodarone and malignancies in humans.6–19
Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials, 4 of which reported cancer deaths, unexpectedly revealed that there were more cancer deaths in
patients assigned to treatment with amiodarone compared
with patients in the control groups (0.8% [13 of 1609
patients] vs 0.3% [4 of 1597 patients]; P ¼ .0501).24
In previous case reports,13-15,18,19 cancers typically
developed after regular use of amiodarone for 2 years to 5
years, suggesting that a latency period and high cumulative doses might be necessary for the development of amiodarone-associated malignancies. On the Kaplan-Meier
analysis performed in the current study, the overall cancer
incidences of patients with low, intermediate, and high
cDDDs were found to be significantly different. However, no differences were observed if only the person-time
and events occurring within the first 2 years were analyzed. This result was compatible with a latency of 2 years.
In the current study, the dose-effect of amiodarone
was confirmed by both external comparison (the SIR estimation) and internal comparison (multivariate Cox
regression model). Compared with the general population, the cancer incidence was significantly higher among
patients with > 180 cDDDs (SIR, 1.28; P ¼ .046), but
not among those with  180 cDDDs. cDDDs, either as
continuous variables or transformed into categorical variables with different cutoff points, were found to be significantly correlated with the development of cancer on
multivariate analysis after adjustment for age, sex, and
comorbidities. The risk was nearly 2-fold when using a
cutoff point of 90 cDDDs (HR, 1.88; P ¼ .010) or when
comparing the highest with the lowest tertile (HR, 1.97;
P ¼ .006).
In the current study, male patients had an increased
risk of cancer, but female patients did not. One possible
explanation for this difference is that there is a 37% higher
clearance rate of amiodarone in females than in males
because of differences in cytochrome P450 3A4 activity
1704

and the percentage of body fat.25 In addition, hormonal
stimuli might play a role in the gender difference. The
increased cancer incidence within 1 year of treatment with
amiodarone may be due to a surveillance bias. To provide
an initial, thorough evaluation of the etiology of arrhythmias and to monitor the toxicity of amiodarone in followup studies, an increased number of medical examinations
are performed in patients treated with amiodarone. Thus,
the cancer incidence within the first year falsely increases
due to early detection.
Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is a well-known
complication among patients who undergo prolonged
treatment with amiodarone. The incidence of amiodaroneinduced thyrotoxicosis was reported to be 3% to 12%,26-28
and was found to be higher in areas with low iodine intake.
Some studies have found an increased risk of thyroid cancer
in patients with thyrotoxicosis and goiter.29 Amiodarone is
associated with a statistically significant, dose-related
increase in the incidence of thyroid tumors (follicular
adenomas and/or carcinomas) in rats.5 Several case reports
have demonstrated a possible correlation between amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer.13-15 In the
current study, the use of amiodarone was not found to be
associated with thyroid cancer (SIR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.012.87), but the case number was too small to draw a definite
conclusion. Furthermore, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were not found to be associated with cancer occurrence on our multivariate Cox regression analysis.
Rare cases with amiodarone-induced pulmonary
masses, amiodaronomas, have been reported, and the oncogenic effects on the lung were considered.6-12 Furthermore,
the long-term administration of amiodarone has been associated with photosensitivity and a blue-gray hyperpigmentation of light-exposed areas of the skin.3,30 Several cases of
multiple basal cell carcinoma were reported after the development of amiodarone-associated skin toxicity.16-19 In the
cohort in the current study, the risks of lung cancer and
skin cancer were not found to be significantly higher than
in the general population, but again the case number was
inadequate for detecting a subtle difference.
The current study has several limitations. Several
potential risk factors, including obesity, smoking, alcohol
use, environmental exposure, and family history of malignancy, were not available in our analyses. Nevertheless, if
these factors were meaningful confounders (ie, if these factors were distributed unevenly among patients treated
with different dose levels of amiodarone), the difference
in cancer incidence would then likely be present from the
beginning of follow-up and not after a latency period, as
in the current study. We could not directly evaluate the

severity of amiodarone-related toxicity (eg, the presence
of organ dysfunctions such as pulmonary fibrosis, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism). In our research, the median follow-up was 2.57 years, due to the greater
comorbidities and higher mortality rate noted in this
patient population. This follow-up might be too short to
detect cancer development. Furthermore, to avoid the
immortal time bias, we only calculated the cDDDs
within the first year. Thus, inevitably, there would be a
nondifferential misclassification bias of the exposure variables (cDDDs) (ie, some patients with high cDDDs in
the first year might actually take low cDDDs of amiodarone thereafter, and vice versa). However, this is a bias
toward the null hypothesis (ie, no association between
cDDDs and cancer). Therefore, the actual effect would
be larger if the misclassification bias was corrected.
Conclusions

The results of the current study demonstrate a higher cancer risk in patients, especially males, treated with higher
cDDDs of amiodarone than in the general population.
There is a dose-effect relation between amiodarone and
cancer occurrence. It should be noted that the evidence
regarding amiodarone as a carcinogen is weak, because the
HR is only 1.001 for 1 additional daily dose. Although
extensive screenings for occult cancers in patients currently undergoing treatment with amiodarone appears to
be impractical, we suggest that cancer events should be
routinely reported in future amiodarone trials, and further
observational research is necessary.
