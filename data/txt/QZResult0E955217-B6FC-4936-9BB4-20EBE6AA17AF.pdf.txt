Abstract

Author Manuscript

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a critical pathway for prostate cancer cells, and androgendeprivation therapy (ADT) remains the principal treatment for patients with locally advanced and
metastatic disease. However, over time, most tumors become resistant to ADT. The view of
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has changed dramatically in the last several years.
Progress in understanding the disease biology and mechanisms of castration resistance led to
significant advancements and to paradigm shift in the treatment. Accumulating evidence showed
that prostate cancers develop adaptive mechanisms for maintaining AR signaling to allow for
survival and further evolution. The aim of this review is to summarize molecular mechanisms of
castration resistance and provide an update in the development of novel agents and strategies to
more effectively target the AR signaling pathway.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

The androgen dependency of prostate cancer (PCa) was first established in the 1940's when
Huggins and Hodges demonstrated the antitumor activity of hormonal manipulation in the
treatment of PCa.1 Since then androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a mainstay in
the treatment of advanced PCa and remains without doubt the single most effective therapy.
Although initial response rates exceed 80%, relapse invariably occurs with the transition to a
more aggressive form of PCa that is termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
Mechanisms of resistance to castration have historically been thought to be androgen
independent. This misconception was dismissed and it is now apparent that signaling
through the AR continues to be crucial for tumor growth under castrate condition in a
significant proportion of patients.
Over the past decades preclinical studies and analyses of CRPC tumor samples have
revealed several mechanisms by which the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway can

be activated/ maintained in the presence of ADT. With a better understanding of the
mechanisms resulting in castration resistance, novel therapeutic agents that target AR axis
have been developed, and have contributed to significantly improve survival of CRPC
patients.2–4 It appears that prostate cancers have selective pressures for maintaining AR
signaling to allow for survival and further evolution.5 Therapies that are more efficient at
blocking this crucial signaling pathway are therefore potentially promising approaches to
further improve CRPC management.

THE AR: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Androgen exerts its biological effects through the AR, a 110-kDa protein that acts as a
nuclear transcription factor. The AR gene is situated at Xq11–12 and consists of eight exons
(Figure 1a). The N-terminal domain (NTD) contains the activation function 1 (AF-1) that
includes two overlapping TAUs (transcription activation units): TAU-1 (amino acids 1–
370), which supports AR transcriptional activity upon stimulation by full agonist, and
TAU-5 (amino acids 360–528), which confers constitutive activity to the AR in the absence
of the ligand-binding domain (LBD).6 The NTD contains several phosphorylation and
sumoylation regulatory sites. The central region of the receptor contains the DNA-binding
domain and the hinge region and harbors the nuclear localization signal. The carboxyterminal end contains the LBD and the AF-2 function. The activity of both AF-1 and AF-2 is
modulated by coregulatory proteins, which function to either upregulate (coactivators) or
downregulate (corepressors) AR activity.7 AR activity largely depends on access to cognate
binding sites on chromatin, facilitated in part by histone-modifying enzymes such as p300
and CREB-binding protein (which directly promote a chromatin landscape favorable for
transcriptional activation) and pioneer factors such as FOXA1 and GATA2 (which promote
open chromatin structure, subsequent nuclear receptor binding nearby and resultant initiation
of specific transcriptional programs).

Author Manuscript

In the absence of hormone ligand, the AR is located in the cytoplasm and associated in a
complex with heat shock proteins HSP90, HSP70 and various cochaperones, which maintain
the AR in a conformation capable of ligand binding and protect the AR from proteolysis.8,9
Upon ligand binding, AR dissociates from HSP90 and undergoes a conformational change
whereby the highly flexible C-terminal helix 12 (H12) realigns over the ligand-binding
pocket to yield a hydrophobic coactivator binding groove that serves as a platform for
interaction with coactivators10 and facilitates NTD/LBD interactions.11–13 The interaction
stabilizes the AR protein by slowing the dissociation rate of the ligand and is important for
optimal transcriptional response.14 Several proteins mediate the import of AR into the
nucleus including the nuclear importin cargo complex that translocates the AR through the
nuclear pores.15 A role for HSP27 in enhancing AR stability, shuttling to the nucleus, and
transcriptional activity was also observed upon treatment with androgens.16
In the canonical genomic pathway, AR translocates to the nucleus and binds to AR-response
elements in the DNA, recruits coregulators to form a pre-initiation complex and together
with the basal transcriptional machinery initiates transcription of specific AR target genes.
In addition in PCa AR can drive the expression of oncogenes such as the ETS transcription
factors (for example, ERG, ETV1) and uncommonly B-RAF or C-RAF as a consequence of

gene rearrangements.17,18 Among these rearrangements, the most common is the fusion of
the 3′ region of ERG with the 5′ region (containing the promoter/enhancer region) of the
highly AR-regulated TMPRSS2 gene. ERG rearrangements have been identified in 40–60%
of PCa.17,19,20 Evidence also suggests that the AR can activate transcription by binding to
other transcription factors and essentially acts as a coactivator.21 Additional studies have
also revealed that activated AR can stimulate downstream kinases (for example, MAPK and
PI3K)22–24 and trigger rapid activation of a mitogenic response through nongenomic AR
signaling.

MECHANISMS OF MAINTAINED AR ACTIVITY IN CRPC
Persistent androgen production: canonical and alternative pathways

Author Manuscript

Around 80% of circulating androgens arise in the testes and are effectively inhibited by
castration (medical or surgical). However, castration cannot prevent the biosynthesis of
androgen inside adrenals. Studies demonstrated that intra-tumoral testosterone in CRPC
tumors are restored to equivalent or even higher levels than in non-castrate prostates.25–27
Intra-tumoral testosterone and/or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in castrate men can be
generated from conversion of circulating adrenal androgens27,28 or possibly by de novo
synthesis of androgens by CRPC cells.29

Author Manuscript

Androgens are synthesized from cholesterol via multiple enzymatic steps, most of which are
catalyzed by members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family (Figure 2). Gene expression
studies have identified alterations in the expression of multiple steroidogenic enzymes in
CRPC tissue including increased levels of SRD5A1, 3βHSD, 17β-HSD5 (also called
AKR1C3) and reduced expression of SRD5A2.27,30,31 SRD5A1 has a preference for
alternative substrates (for example, progesterone, 17OHP and AD) rather than testosterone
and mediates the 5α-androstanedione pathway synthesis of DHT.32 A recently described,
ubiquitously expressed SRD5A type 3 isoform is also present at higher levels in PCa.33,34
Increased levels of SRD5A1 and 3 may facilitate conversion of DHT via the alternative
pathway. A gain-of-function mutation in 3βHSD1 has also been identified in CRPC.35 The
mutation (N367T) renders the enzyme resistant to ubiquitination and degradation, leading to
profound accumulation and increased flux to DHT. Taken together, these findings suggest
that ADT can activate an adaptive response in PCa which augments its ability to convert
adrenal precursors into testosterone and DHT through both canonical and alternative
pathways that bypass testosterone.
AR point mutations

Author Manuscript

More than 100 somatic mutations in the AR have been described so far, most of which occur
either in the NTD or the LBD (http://androgendb.mcgill.ca/). Relevant mutations reported to
date cluster in particular regions involved in critical ligand receptor and protein-receptor
interactions.36,37 Mutations in the hinge region and LBD usually confer increased
transactivational activity and reduced ligand specificity. A large number of AR mutations
result in promiscuous activation of the AR by weak adrenal androgens and other steroid
hormones; other mutations convert AR antagonists (flutamide and bicalutamide) into potent
agonists.

Author Manuscript

AR mutations are rare in early stage untreated PCa but are common in CRPC, where they
are present in approximately 10–30% of patients previously treated with the first-generation
antiandrogens, bicalutamide and especially flutamide.38–42 It has been proposed that
treatment with specific AR antagonists actually selects for tumors expressing AR mutants
activated by the therapeutic agent.43 Therapy-specific selection of AR mutants represents a
possible mechanism for the withdrawal syndrome in which tumors regress on antiandrogens
discontinuation,44,45 and explains why tumors resistant to first-generation antagonist may
still respond favorably to second-generation antiandrogens.46,47 Recently, a novel missense
mutation in the LBD, F876L, which can convert second-generation antiandrogens
enzalutamide and ARN-509 into AR agonist and drive resistance in preclinical models48,49
have been identified in patients treated with ARN-509.50
AR overexpression

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Up to 80% of CRPC display a marked increase in AR mRNA and protein.51–54 In nearly
one-third of patients progressing after castration and antiandrogens, the mechanism for
increased AR expression is through amplification of the AR gene.51,52,55–57 In contrast,
untreated PCa very rarely contain an AR gene amplification.51 Studies also reported high
frequency of AR gene amplification in circulating tumor cells in CRPC.20,58 The
mechanisms leading to AR overexpression without gene amplification are still elusive, but
may include increased transcription rates, or stabilization of the mRNA or protein.59–61
Interestingly, tissue- and cell-specific AR mRNA regulation (both up and downregulation)
by AR and other oncogenes, including cMYC, has been reported;62–64 and functional,
exonic AR-response elements have been identified in exons 4 and 5 of the AR gene.65 AR
overexpression can confer AR hypersensitivity to low levels of androgens and can result in
continued tumor proliferation despite minimal androgen concentrations.56,66 In experimental
PCa models, an increase in AR protein concentration can also cause antagonist–agonist
conversion of bicalutamide.67
AR splice variants

Author Manuscript

We and others68–72 have established the existence of truncated AR splice variants (AR-Vs)
that contain an intact AR NTD and DNA-binding domain, but lack the LBD, which is the
target of current hormonal agents (Figures 1b and c). Increased expression of these AR-Vs
in CRPC are often coupled with increased transcription from the AR gene locus (or loci
when AR is amplified), but may arise due to aberrant splicing and/or structural
rearrangements of the AR gene.71,73,74 Multiple AR-Vs have been fully decoded and proven
to be expressed in CRPC, with differing properties.75,76 Key differences among the known
variants include transcriptional activity and expression abundance. AR-V7 is constitutively
active and the most abundant variant detected to date in CRPC.77 In some but not all cell
line models, ligand stimulation negatively regulates AR-V7 expression, and elevated AR-V7
directs a distinct transcriptional program.77 In preclinical models, AR-V7 levels and
function cannot be suppressed, and may be enhanced by AR-directed therapies including
abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.77–79 On the basis of mRNA levels, AR-Vs generally
appear to be expressed at low levels relative to the full length AR in CRPC specimens. The
full-length AR and AR-Vs appear to almost always coexist in PCa, introducing a challenge

to dissect in translational studies of clinical specimens their relative roles in driving AR
signaling.
Cross-talk with other signal transduction pathways

Author Manuscript

Although AR is a central player in PCa, other signaling pathways and their interactions with
AR signaling are also critically implicated in PCa progression.80–84 The
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is one of the most commonly altered
signaling pathway in PCa (Table 1). Loss-of-function mutations or deletions involving the
tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are commonly observed in
advanced PCa (with loss of heterozygosity at PTEN locus present in up to 60% of
patients).85–87 The frequency of PI3K pathway alteration rises substantially when PTEN
alterations are considered together with alterations in the INPP4B and PHLPP phosphatases
recently implicated in PI3K regulation, the PIK3CA gene itself, and the PIK3CA regulatory
subunits.54 Whole genome sequencing studies have also recently identified complex
rearrangements disrupting both PTEN and its interacting protein MAGI2.88 In PTENdeficient preclinical models, it has been demonstrated that AR and PI3K/Akt pathways
cross-regulate each other by reciprocal feedback, thereby maintaining tumor cell survival,
and combined pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K and AR signaling axis is more effective
than single agent AR or Akt inhibition.81,89 This strategy is currently under evaluation in
clinical trials (Table 2).
Alteration of coregulators and pioneer factors

Author Manuscript

Deregulation of expression and/or turnover of coactivators, corepressors and pioneer factors
may provide a mechanism for increased AR transcriptional activity, promoting PCa cell
survival.90, 91 The p160 SRCs have critical roles in AR transcriptional activity, cell
proliferation and resistance to androgen deprivation. Interestingly, speckle-type POZ protein
(SPOP) mutations found in 6–15% of PCa,92 can alter SRC-3 activity.93 Wild-type SPOP
interacts directly with SRC-3 and regulates SRC-3 turnover acting as a tumor-suppressor in
PCa cells. Somatic missense SPOP mutations lack the capacity to attenuate the coactivator
function of SRC-3 on AR transcriptional activity. These studies provide a possible
explanation for the role of SPOP mutations in PCa, and highlight the potential of SRC-3 as a
therapeutic target in SPOP-mutated PCa. SRC-1 and SRC-3 coactivators are now the focus
of new drug discovery programs.
Post-translational modification of AR

Author Manuscript

Multiple and diverse post-translational modifications of AR have been described including
phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination and methylation.94 AR is
phosphorylated at multiple sites and studies suggest that this mechanism can enhance both
ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation capacity. Several preclinical studies
have demonstrated that kinases activated by surface signals (cytokines and growth factors)
or oncogenic mechanisms can directly enhance AR transcriptional function through
modification of the AR itself, or by augmenting the activity of AR coactivators, contributing
to the generation of a hypersensitive phenotype (reviewed in ref. 95). There are many
examples of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases implicated in AR phosphorylation and
amongst the most interesting are Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A),96 cyclin-dependent kinase 1

inhibitors in clinical development.
Cross talk with DNA damage pathways

Author Manuscript

The PARP (Poly ADP-ribose polymerase) family of enzymes modifies a subset of nuclear
proteins by poly (ADP-ribose)-ylation, and is known to have a critical role in DNA damage
repair and transcription. Inhibition of PARP1 is selectively lethal in tumors that harbor
defective homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair.103,104 PARP inhibitors have
shown impressive and durable responses in BRCA carrier patients suffering from advanced
PCa.103,105 Recently, it has been shown that PARP-1 has a second major cellular function
on chromatin as a transcriptional co-regulator, capable of modulating chromatin structure
and transcription factor activity.106 PARP enzymatic activity is critical for AR occupancy on
chromatin and for AR transcriptional activity in hormone-dependent and CRPC models107
and also mediates ETS transcription factor activity.108 These observations and nextgeneration sequencing studies identifying aberrations in DNA repair genes in up to 15–20%
of sporadic CRPC86,109 have led to the clinical evaluation of PARP inhibitors as a strategy
for simultaneously inhibiting AR activity and exploiting cancer-specific susceptibility to
PARPi-genotoxic stresses.
Alternative steroid receptors

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Glucocorticoids are widely used in the treatment of CRPC patients to slow disease
progression, to palliate symptoms and to offset side effects of chemotherapy and hormonal
therapy. The mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity seen in CRPC, also if still
elusive, include suppression of adrenal steroidogenesis and a direct anti-proliferative effect
mediated by modulation of TGF-β, IL-6 and IL-8.110 Few data are available on the
expression and regulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in PCa. Although AR is expressed
in nearly all PCa, GR is only found in around 30%. This percentage, however, increases
after ADT.111 Recent studies have demonstrated that AR and GR share the same chromatin
binding sites and GR can regulate a large number of genes considered to be AR pathwayspecific.112 It was also shown that resistance to novel antiandrogen enzalutamide can occur
via increased expression of GR.113 This introduces the hypothesis that the GR, or potentially
other nuclear steroid receptors, can bypass AR pathway blockade. Further work is needed to
elucidate the context by which the various roles of GR are regulated. The six related steroid
receptors, AR, estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β, progesterone receptor (PR), GR, and
mineralcorticoid receptor (MR), arose from a single ancestor and display high homology, in
particular in the DNA-binding domain. Phylogenetic studies demonstrated that AR, GR, and
PR are the most closely related.114,115 Given the evidence that GR can regulate a number of
AR target genes and that it is itself increased during CRPC, it must be considered that
redundancy may exist between AR and other steroid receptors.

NOVEL AGENTS AND STRATEGIES TO TARGET MAINTAINED AR

second-line hormonal therapies with relatively limited clinical benefit. These included the

addition of first-generation antiandrogens such as flutamide and bicalutamide,
corticosteriods, estrogenic agents such as diethylstilbestrol, and the non-specific CYP
inhibitor ketoconazole. After many years in which new developments were stalled, progress
in translational research has finally brought us to an exciting era in the management of
CRPC with several rationally developed new agents that target the AR signaling axis.
Androgen biosynthesis inhibitors

Author Manuscript

CYP17 inhibitors—Abiraterone (formerly known as CB7598) was identified in the 1990's
in the Jarman lab using an iterative process to design and develop derivatives of the
CYP17A1 substrate pregnenolone that were then evaluated in a human testicular microsome
assay.116 Abiraterone significantly inhibited both activities of CYP17A1, that is, 17αhydroxylase and C17–20 lyase, with similar potency (IC50 of 4 and 2.9 nM, respectively).
Due to its poor bioavailability the 3-Beta-O-acetate form abiraterone acetate (formerly
known as CB7630) that is rapidly deacetylated to the active drug in vivo was developed.117

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Abiraterone acetate was the first-in-class selective CYP17A1 inhibitor118 to enter clinical
development in the late 1990's, but development was discontinued due to lack of investment
and safety concerns arising from an attenuated cortisol rise following an adrenocorticotropic
hormone stimulation test seen in initial limited duration of exposure phase I studies.119 The
clinical development was re-started in 2005 with a series of phase I/II studies that
demonstrated significant prostate specific antigen (PSA) responses and anti-tumor activity in
both chemotherapy-naive and post-docetaxel-treated CRPC patients, including in patients
who have progressed on ketoconazole.120 Abiraterone acetate monotheraphy was associated
with a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess due to a compensatory rise in
adrenocorticotropic hormone, characterized by fluid retention, hypokalemia and lowerextremity edema, which was easily reversed with the use of eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonist, or with daily low-dose steroids that suppress adrenocorticotropic
hormone.121 The improved tolerability when administered in combination with low-dose
steroids led to its further development in combination with low-dose steroids. The
encouraging phase II results rapidly led in 2008 to the initiation of a large randomized phase
III study (COU-AA-301) in CRPC patients who had failed previous treatment with
docetaxel. Median overall survival (OS) in the abiraterone and prednisone arm was
significantly prolonged (15.8 months compared with 11.2 months in the placebo arm;
P<0.0001).2,122 Abiraterone and prednisone also significantly delayed pain progression and
skeletal-related events and improved quality of life and pain control.123 A second large
randomized phase III trial started in 2009 (COU-AA-302) in chemotherapy-naive men with
CRPC with rising PSA but minimal symptoms from their disease.3 At a median follow-up of
22.2 months, abiraterone produced a statistically significant improvement in radiological
progression-free survival and increased OS. Abiraterone resulted in clinically and
statistically significant effects on all secondary endpoints of the study.
Co-administration of low-dose prednisone with abiraterone acetate ameliorates
hypertension, hypokalemia and fluid overload resulting from mineralocorticoid excess
induced by CYP17A1 hydroxylase inhibition. Due to these aforementioned side-effects,

there is increased interest in developing new CYP17A1 inhibitors that more specifically
inhibit 17,20-lyase and are therefore less likely to require GC co-administration.

Author Manuscript

Orteronel (TAK-700; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA) is a
naphthylmethylimidazole derivative discovered by Takeda Pharmaceuticals (Osaka, Japan)
that inhibits the 17,20-lyase activity 5.4 times more potently than 17α-hydroxylase
activity.124 Two large randomized phase III trials in chemotherapy-naive (ELM-PC 4) and
chemotherapy-treated CRPC (ELM-PC 5; NCT01193244 and NCT01193257, respectively)
have completed recruitment. The ELM-PC 5 study comparing orteronel plus prednisone vs
placebo plus prednisone in docetaxel pre-treated metastatic CRPC patient was recently
unblinded after a scheduled interim analysis that indicated that orteronel would likely not
meet the primary endpoint of improved OS when compared with the control arm (http://
www.takeda.com/news/2013-/20130726_5894.html). Galeterone (VN/124-1, TOK-001;
Tokai Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA) is a combined inhibitor of CYP17A1 and
AR developed by the Brodie lab (Baltimore, MD, USA)125 currently in phase II testing
(ARMOR2) (NCT01709734). VT-464 (Viamet Inc., Durham, NC, USA) is a potent,
nonsteroidal CYP17 inhibitor discovered by Viamet with a 60-fold greater specificity for
17,20-lyase than 17α-hydroxylase and could therefore potentially not require concomitant
exogenous glucocorticoids. Treatment of monkeys with VT-464 did not cause a rise in
steroids upstream of CYP17A1 in contrast to abiraterone.126 This agent is also in early
clinical trials (EudraCT Number: 2011-004103-2).

Author Manuscript

Targeting of other components of the androgen biosynthesis pathways—A
number of drugs limiting androgen availability by blocking steroidal enzymes other than
CYP17A1 have been developed. Critically, both the conventional and alternative pathways
of androgen biosynthesis are dependent on CYP17A1 17,20-lyase for production of
androgens and to date CYP17A1-independent mechanisms for androgen biosynthesis have
not yet been identified. Thus the role of other inhibitors may be limited to combinations with
CYP17A1 inhibitors when 17,20-lyase blockade is incomplete.

Author Manuscript

Increased levels of SRD5A1 and 3 is observed in CRPC30,31 and may facilitate conversion
of DHT via the alternative pathway (Figure 2). Increased expression of SRD5A1 can have
clinical implications as the commonly used 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride is relatively
specific for the type 2 enzyme, whereas dutasteride inhibits both enzymes. A phase II study
is looking at the addition of dutasteride to abiraterone in metastatic CRPC (NCT01393730).
AKR1C3 was reported to be highly expressed in CRPC.31 ASP9521 is a potent, selective
and orally bioavailable AKR1C3 inhibitor discovered by Astellas Pharmaceutical by high
throughput screening approaches for targeting enzyme activity.127 Results from a phase I/II
study were recently reported but no activity was seen in a monotherapy study.128
Second-generation antiandrogens
Antiandrogens are agents that compete with endogenous androgens for the ligand-binding
pocket of the AR and ‘actively’ antagonize the AR through a steric clash.129–131
Nonsteroidal first-generation AR antagonists (bicalutamide, nilutamide or flutamide) have
been a standard treatment for advanced PCa for over three decades. However, first-

generation antiandrogens are reversible inhibitors of the AR, have a several-fold lower
affinity for the AR compared with androgens, do not result in significant degradation or
cytoplasmic sequestration of the AR and can result in agonist behavior.132,133 Evidence
supporting resistance to ‘first-generation’ antiandrogens following the emergence of
mutations in the LBD or AR increased expression led to efforts to develop novel and more
potent antiandrogens.67

Author Manuscript

Enzalutamide (formerly MDV3100) is a rationally designed potent second-generation
antiandrogen developed in the Jung/ Sawyers lab utilizing as a starting point agonistic
compounds previously crystalized bound to the AR LBD.134 Enzalutamide was selected for
clinical development after showing activity in bicalutamide-resistant PCa models with
overexpression of AR and mutant AR. A phase I/II study conducted in 140 men with
metastatic CPRC showed evidence of antitumor activity, with 50% or greater decline of
PSA in 62 and 51% of chemotherapy-naive patients and docetaxel-treated patients, and a
median time to PSA progression of 41 and 21 weeks, respectively.135 The phase III
AFFIRM study randomized men with metastatic CRPC who had previously received
docetaxel chemotherapy. After a planned interim analysis, which showed a median of 4.8
months improvement in OS (hazard ratio = 0.631, P<0.0001) in favor of enzalutamide, the
study was unblinded. The phase III PREVAIL study in men with chemotherapy-naive CRPC
(NCT01212991) was recently unblinded and has met its co-primary endpoints of OS and
radiological progression-free survival.136

Author Manuscript

From the same chemical series of enzalutamide, a second analogous diarylthiohydantoin
ARN-509 (Aragon Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, USA) showed similarly potent AR
antagonism. In preclinical models, ARN-509 exhibited similar AR antagonism as
enzalutamide and additional potentially advantageous features, including reduced crossing
of the blood–brain barrier.137 Phase I/II analysis of ARN-509 (NCT01171898) has
demonstrated that the drug is safe and well tolerated with evidence of promising preliminary
activity in chemotherapy-naive CRPC both before and after treatment with
abiraterone.138,139

Author Manuscript

Predictably, the significant activity reported in phase I/II studies of enzalutamide led to
significant investment and interest in developing other novel antiandrogens. ODM-201
(Orion, Espoo, Finland), is a potent AR antagonist that does not cross the brain barrier in
preclinical model.121 Two phase I/II trials (NCT01317641; NCT01784757) assessed the
efficacy and safety of ODM-201 in metastatic CRPC patients. PSA decline and RECIST
(response evaluation criteria in solid tumor) responses were observed across different
patients groups with highest activity seen in the chemotherapy- and CYP17 inhibitor-naive
group (response rate 30%; PSA decline >50% in >80% patients).140,141
Agents targeting AR NTD
An alternative to blocking the AR is targeting the NTD, which is essential for both liganddependent and ligand-independent AR activation. The AR NTD is flexible with a high
degree of intrinsic disorder142,143 making it challenging to develop a therapeutic using
rational structure-based drug design. One compound reported to target the AR NTD is
EPI-001, isolated from a compound screen of a library of extracts from the marine sponge

Geodia lindgreni.144 EPI-001 binds to the AR NTD without altering ligand binding or AR
nuclear translocation. Instead EPI-001 inhibits AR transactivation by disrupting AF-1
function and inhibiting cofactor recruitment and N/C interaction regardless of the presence
of androgen. As EPI-001 does not require the LBD, it may have antitumor activity in the
setting of AR-Vs.
Alternative targeting of the AR

Author Manuscript

Traditional AR antagonists, such as flutamide or bicalutamide, act by binding to the ligand
binding pocket of the receptor, resulting in a conformational change of the LBD and in an
indirect blockade of transcriptional activity. Recently other chemical approaches have been
pursued to develop improved AR inhibitors. EZN-4176 is a third-generation locked
antisense oligonucleotides that binds the hinge region of the AR and results in
downregulation of AR protein.145 The first-in-human clinical trial of EZN-4176 in CRPC
patients, however, showed only modest activity with dosing limited by significant but
reversible transaminitis.146 An alternative way to target AR is the use of small peptides that
disrupt specific protein–protein interactions. Peptidomimetics are small organic molecules
that do not possess a peptide backbone structure, but retain a capacity to interact with the
same target protein by mimicking protein structures. Peptidomimetics combine the
advantages of both peptides (that is, high efficacy, target selectivity) and small organic
molecules (that is, cell permeability, stability from protease-mediated proteolytic
degradation) and since peptidomimetics can mimic selective motifs in defined
conformations, they may be designed to interfere with specific protein–protein interactions
involving the different domains of the AR including the NTD.147

Another strategy currently being evaluated to disrupt continued AR signaling is the
destabilization of the AR by inhibiting HSPs. We and others have tested HSP90 inhibitors in
early clinical studies. Limited antitumor activity was reported to date in CRPC, although we
have reported a durable response lasting more than a year in a patient treated with 17DMAG (17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin).148 A phase II single
agent study of Ganetespib (STA-9090, Synta Pharmaceuticals, Lexington, MA, USA), a
synthetic next-generation HSP90 inhibitor, has been recently stopped at the first stage of
enrollment due to lack of activity as per study design.149 A phase I/II study evaluating the
novel resorcinol inhibitor AT13387 (Astex Pharmaceuticals, Dublin, CA, USA) alone or in
combination with abiraterone and low-dose steroids in patients no longer responding to
treatment with abiraterone is ongoing (NCT01685268).

OGX-427 (OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Bothell, WA, USA), a second-generation ASO
drug targeting HSP27, has been evaluated in a randomized phase II study in combination
with low-dose prednisone in patients with CRPC who have not previously received
chemotherapy (NCT01120470). Preliminary results showed promising activity in terms of
delaying disease progression (71% of patients were progression-free at 12 weeks compared
with 31% in the prednisone-alone arm), ≥ 50% PSA falls (41% vs 20% in the prednisolonealone arm), and decline in circulating tumor cell count (NCT01120470). The value of adding

OGX-427 to continuing abiraterone and prednisone in patients with metastatic CRPC who
have PSA progression will be evaluated in a randomized phase II study (NCT01681433).
Several histone deacetylase inhibitors, including depsipeptide, SAHA and LBH589 were
tested in phase I/II clinical trials in CRPC with very modest activity observed. Recent
reports show that sulforaphane, a derivative of glucoraphanin found in crucifers, may impair
PCa growth through inhibition of histone deacetylase 6. Sulforaphane treatment increases
HSP90 acetylation and leads to dissociation of AR from HSP90 and results in AR
degradation and impaired expression of AR target genes.150 A novel sulforaphane–
cyclodextrin complex orally bioavailable called Sulforadex (Evgen Limited, Liverpool, UK)
has entered first-inhuman clinical trials.
PARP inhibitors

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Emerging data suggest that homologous recombination DNA repair defects are common in
PCa, potentially conferring a BRCAness phenotype.86 PARP is also implicated in ERG
transcription and AR signaling, key drivers in PCa.107 Various PARP inhibitors are
currently under development for the treatment of sporadic CRPC. Niraparib (formerly
MK4827, Tesaro, Waltham, MA, USA), a potent PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor, has been
tested in a dose-escalation phase I/II trial in BRCA mutation carriers and patients with
sporadic cancer. Nine of 21 (43%) patients with sporadic CRPC receiving active doses of
niraparib (either 290/day or 300 mg/day) had stable disease for a median duration of 254
days. One patient had a greater than 50% decrease in concentration of PSA and remained on
study for 306 days. No radiological responses were recorded, but decreases in circulating
tumor cells of at least 30% were noted in eight patients.151 Olaparib (AZD2281,
AstraZeneca, London, UK), a selective PARP-1 inhibitor, is currently being tested as a
single agent in CRPC patients (TOPARP) (NCT01682772). A second randomized phase II
study is evaluating veliparib (ABT-888, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA), a
PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor, in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone vs
abiraterone acetate and prednisone alone (NCT01576172).
Therapies aimed to block cross-talk of the AR with other signaling pathways

Author Manuscript

A common and targetable set of alterations in PCa involves the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway.
Pan-class I PI3K inhibitors and potent and isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors have entered
clinical trials. Data indicated that PI3K isoform selectivity may be important to maximize
therapeutic benefit and minimize toxicity. Preclinical data indicate that p110β, and possibly
p110δ152 isoforms are important for the growth of PTEN-null tumors.153,154 p110β also
appears to be essential for androgen-induced AR transactivation. Phase I studies are
currently evaluating the p110β-specific-inhibitors AZD8186 (AstraZeneca) (NCT01884285)
and GSK--2636771(GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) (NCT01458067) in CRPC. There are
also several classes of Akt inhibitors currently in development, including isoform-selective
Akt catalytic-domain inhibitors. Although the importance of the individual Akt isoforms in
PCa has yet to be fully elucidated a recent study demonstrated distinct roles for Akt-1 and
Akt-2 in PCa cell growth and migration.155 Simultaneous targeting of Akt-1 and Akt-2 was
shown to be superior to the inhibition of a single isozyme for induction of caspase-3 activity
in tumor cells, suggesting that pan-Akt inhibitors are likely to be more promising, although

toxicity may be a potential issue.156 Given the evidence of a reciprocal feedback loop
between the AR and PI3K/Akt pathway,81 combination of novel AR-targeted drugs
enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate with PI3K/Akt inhibitors appears to hold great promise
(Table 1).

Author Manuscript

Various tyrosine kinase inhibitors are also under evaluation in combination with abiraterone
acetate (Table 1). Cabozantinib (XL-184, Exelexis, San Francisco, CA, USA), a
multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that has shown encouraging antitumor activity as
single agent in CRPC157 is currently being tested in two phase II studies in combination
with abiraterone acetate (NCT01574937); (NCT01995058). The multitargeted tyrosine
kinase inhibitor sunitinib (Sutent) and dasatinib (Sprycel) have been tested in combination
with docetaxel in large phase III trial and failed to increase the efficacy of docetaxel158,159
despite encouraging results in phase II studies.160,161 Ongoing studies are exploring a
different strategy and testing the hypothesis that suppression of androgens through CYP17
inhibition with abiraterone acetate in combination with dasatinib (NCT01254864) or
sunitinib (NCT01254864) might result in improved efficacy.

PERSPECTIVES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Author Manuscript

The realization that many prostate tumors are still dependent on AR activity after ADT has
provided a paradigm shift in our understanding of the role of AR signaling in the
progression of PCa. A number of cellular mechanisms have been described whereby the AR
can be activated despite castration to significantly contribute to the progression of PCa,
either alone or, more likely, in concert with each other. Myriad aberrations at various levels,
from androgen synthesis to receptor binding on DNA, suggest mechanisms that contribute to
disease progression. The challenge for researchers and clinicians now is to find the right
therapeutic modalities to inhibit AR-driven PCa progression and identify biomarkers to
guide treatment selection.
With many mechanisms at play, sometimes simultaneously, the next logical steps seem to be
the use of combination regimens, which could potentially increase treatment efficacy and
explore the utility of novel agents in earlier stages of the disease. Impressive responses have
been reported with abiraterone and enzalutamide in the neoadjuvant setting162 and hormonenaïve PCa.163

Author Manuscript

Exciting opportunities have emerged in the field of combining AR axis–targeting agents
with inhibitors of other oncogenic signaling pathways, however, this line of approach may
be fraught with pitfalls. Redundancy between signaling pathways and negative-feedback
loops within a single signaling pathway can make durable inhibition difficult to achieve.
Studies to understand the potential of ‘horizontal’ and ‘vertical’ blockade as well as studies
to understand the potential for stratification of patients, should be considered in targeted
drug development and efforts made to use genomic abnormalities to optimally stratified
patients for treatment (Table 1).
Despite their documented efficacy, neither abiraterone nor enzalutamide are curative and
resistant disease eventually develops. In addition, not all patients respond to these
treatments. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie acquired and primary resistance is a

priority in PCa research to inform on the development of the next therapeutic strategies. In
the case of abiraterone, preclinical models of resistance have suggested that treatment
upregulates the expression of full-length AR, truncated AR-Vs and several steroidogenic
enzymes, including CYP17A1 and AKR1C3.79,164–166 Translational studies to date have
failed to identify a rise in circulating androgens on treatment.123,166 However, measurement
of intracellular androgens has been limited by the availability of CRPC tissue and the
technical and analytical challenges of controlling for losses during extraction and
processing, and definitively separating, detecting and identifying particular steroids among
highly related compounds.

Author Manuscript

Several preclinical studies have also shown that mutant AR can become promiscuously
activated by very low levels of androgens (that could persist in patients treated with
abiraterone), other steroid metabolites and drugs that bind the AR (such as prednisolone
given concomitantly to abiraterone).38,166–168 These models support co-targeting
combinations of CYP17 inhibitors with other enzymatic inhibitors or with potent secondgeneration AR antagonists. Combined therapy, particularly with abiraterone plus
enzalutamide and/or related compounds, is a particularly interesting area of study
(NCT01650194; NCT01792687; NCT01949337). However, it is possible that primary
mechanisms of cross-resistance to both compounds exist.

Author Manuscript

Recently, a novel missense mutation in the AR LBD, F876LF, has been identified in plasma
DNA from ARN-509–treated patients with progressive disease. This mutation confers
agonistic activity to enzalutamide and ARN-509 in preclinical models.48–50 The
identification of this novel amino acid change that bestows resistance to these secondgeneration antiandrogens may enable the design and/or discovery of next-generation agents
targeting the LBD. Studies are required to determine the frequency of this mutation in
patients with acquired resistance to enzalutanide, and to evaluate whether clonal selection of
mutant AR-expressing clones also occurs on abiraterone.
The constitutively active AR-Vs have been proposed as mechanisms of resistance to both
abiraterone and enzalutamide.78,79,165 However, in our view, investigations encom passing
the full spectrum of molecular characterization and clinical translation of AR-V are still at a
nascent stage. Nevertheless, the implications are clear and multifaceted. Because AR
signaling mediated by these truncated AR molecules is not targeted by therapies targeting
the AR LBD, such as enzalutamide and abiraterone, rational development of novel agents
that target the NTD of AR could represent a key step to overcome endocrine resistance.

Author Manuscript

The majority of patients progressing on abiraterone and enzalutamide have a rise in PSA,
suggesting reactivation of AR or other steroid signaling pathways that could increase PSA
transcription. However, the hypothesis that continued activation of the AR receptor
signaling pathways results in drug resistance in a significant proportion of CRPC patients
progressing on abiraterone and enzalutamide is still unproven. Moreover, the widespread use
of novel AR-targeted therapies may produce the emergence of PCa that no longer depends
on AR signaling. Small retrospective reports on the use of abiraterone after enzalutamide
failure and vice versa suggests only modest response rates and brief duration of
effect.128,169,170 However, the benefit for a few is significant. Studies are required to

elucidate mechanisms of resistance to these novel AR-targeted therapies.171 Procurement
and study of tumors resistant to these therapies is necessary and should be prioritized.

Schematic structure of human AR and AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7) and 567(AR567es). (a)
The human AR gene consists of eight exons with exon 1 encoding the N-terminal domain
(NTD) and the entire 5′ untranslated region; exons 2 and 3 encoding the DNA-binding
domain (DBD); and exons 4–8 encoding the ‘hinge’ region (HR) and ligand binding domain
(LBD). The NTD contains the activation function 1 (AF-1) that includes two overlapping
transcription activation units (TAU): TAU-1 (amino acids 1–370), which supports AR
transcriptional activity upon stimulation by full agonist, and TAU-5 (amino acids 360–528),
which confers constitutive activity to the AR in the absence of the LBD. The central region
of the receptor contains the DBD and the HR and harbors the nuclear localization signal
(NLS). The DBD is comprised of two cysteine-rich zinc finger motifs consisting of three
alpha-helixes and a carboxy terminal extension (CTE) extending into the flexible hinge
region. The first zinc finger defines DNA binding specificity, whereas the second zinc finger

facilitates receptor dimerization and stabilization of the DNA-receptor complex. The
carboxy-terminal end contains the LBD and the AF-2 function; (b) AR-V7 (also named
AR3) encodes a protein with exons 1–3 and a terminal cryptic exon (CE3); (c) AR567es
encodes a protein comprised of exons 1–4, and because of a frame-shift due to loss of exons
5–7, exon 8 has a stop codon generated after the first 10 amino acids resulting in a shortened
exon 8.

Canonical and alternative androgen biosynthesis pathways. Androgens are synthesized from
cholesterol via multiple enzymatic steps, most of which are catalyzed by members of the
cytochrome P450 (CYP) family. CYP11A1 is responsible for side chain cleavage of
cholesterol, converting cholesterol to pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is then metabolized to
dehydro-epiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione (AD) via CYP17A1, which
catalyzes both the 17 α-hydroxylation and the subsequent 17,20-lyase cleavage. The
‘canonical pathway’ for testosterone synthesis involves conversion of the major adrenal
androgen DHEA and AD to testosterone in the testis, followed by irreversible 5α-reduction
of testosterone to the higher affinity ligand DHT by 5α-reductases (SRD5A). 5α-reduction
of upstream steroids, as opposed to 5α-reduction of testosterone, leads to DHT synthesis that
bypasses testosterone through at least two pathways. In the ‘androstanedione pathway’, AD
may be converted to 5-androstanedione by SRD5A that can then be converted into DHT by
17βHSD(s). Another alternative pathway to DHT occurs when 17-hydroxyprogesterone
accumulates and SRD5A enzymes are present. In this alternative or ‘backdoor’ pathway, 17hydroxyprogesterone is 5α- and 3α- reduced before the 17,20-lyase reaction of CYP17A1,
yielding the 5α-reduced androgen androsterone. This pathway yields DHT without using
DHEA, AD and testosterone as intermediates.
