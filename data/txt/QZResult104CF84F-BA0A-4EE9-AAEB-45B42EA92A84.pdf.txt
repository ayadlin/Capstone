ABSTRACT
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are major regulators of many cellular processes
including cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. In this study, we identify a novel
lncRNA, MA-linc1, and reveal its effects on cell cycle progression and cancer growth.
Inhibition of MA-linc1 expression alters cell cycle distribution, leading to a decrease
in the number of G1 cells and a concomitant increase in all other stages of the cell
cycle, and in particular G2/M, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of M phase.
Accordingly, knock down of MA-linc1 inhibits M phase exit upon release from a mitotic
block. We further demonstrate that MA-linc1 predominantly functions in cis to repress
expression of its neighboring gene, Purα, which is often deleted in human cancers
and whose ectopic expression inhibits cell cycle progression. Knock down of Purα
partially rescues the MA-linc1 dependent inhibition of M phase exit. In agreement
with its suggested role in M phase, inhibition of MA-linc1 enhances apoptotic cell
death induced by the antimitotic drug, Paclitaxel and this enhancement of apoptosis
is rescued by Purα knockdown. Furthermore, high levels of MA-linc1 are associated
with reduced survival in human breast and lung cancer patients.
Taken together, our data identify MA-linc1 as a novel lncRNA regulator of cell
cycle and demonstrate its potential role in cancer progression and treatment.

of nearby target genes [12]. In contrast, other lncRNAs
regulate gene expression in trans, mainly by directing
the chromatin localization of associated proteins
[1, 10, 11]. Their recognition of the target loci can involve
recruitment by tethering proteins [12] or formation of
RNA:DNA triplexes [13]. Some lncRNAs also exert
indirect regulatory effects on gene expression by acting
as decoys that sequester transcription factors [4, 14] or
microRNAs [15–17].
Many lncRNAs are frequently aberrantly expressed
in various human cancers, with potential roles in both
oncogenic and tumor suppressive pathways [18–20].
Moreover, some lncRNAs induce epigenetic dysregulation
of critical genes in cancer.
In particular, a number of lncRNAs were suggested
to function in cell cycle progression via modulation of the
expression of critical cell cycle regulators such as cyclins,
CDKs and CDK inhibitors [21–24]. Other lncRNAs
were shown to mediate p53-dependent cell cycle control
[25, 26]. Interestingly, a recent study described a set of

INTRODUCTION
Genome-wide transcriptome studies have revealed
that mammalian genomes express thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are > 200 bases in length
but lack significant open reading frames [1]. Thousands of
lncRNAs are evolutionarily conserved [2, 3] and exhibit
expression patterns that correlate with various cellular
processes [2–6]. Furthermore, the expression of many
lncRNAs is tissue-specific [1, 7] and many lncRNAs play
a critical role in regulation of diverse cellular processes
such as stem cell pluripotency, cell growth, development,
differentiation and apoptosis [2–6, 8, 9]. It is now
considered likely that this class of ncRNA represents a
significant feature of normal cellular networks.
Recent studies have identified a number of
mechanisms by which lncRNAs function [1, 10, 11]. Some
well-characterized nuclear lncRNAs have been shown to
modulate gene expression in cis by recruiting chromatinmodifying complexes and altering the chromatin structure

human lncRNAs that exhibit periodic expression during
the cell cycle, and many of these are aberrantly expressed
in cancer [4].
Many, although not all, lncRNAs are generated
and processed through the same machinery as mRNA.
Specifically, many lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA
polymerase II [27] and their promoters are bound
and regulated by transcription factors known to
influence mRNA transcription, including cancer-related
transcription factors such as p53 [28, 29], Myc [30, 31]
and E2F [32–34].
Here, we demonstrate that a novel lncRNA, which
we named MA-linc1 (Mitosis-Associated Long Intergenic
Non-Coding RNA 1), is transcriptionally regulated
by E2F1 and plays a role in cell cycle progression.
Specifically, silencing of MA-linc1 in unsynchronized
cells results in fewer cells in G1 and a concomitant
increase in the number of cells in all other stages of the
cell cycle, particularly in G2/M. Moreover, its silencing
in M phase-arrested cells inhibits mitosis exit. The effect
of MA-linc1 on cell cycle progression is mediated, at least
in part, by repression of its neighboring gene, Purα, a cell
cycle regulator whose expression induces cell cycle arrest.
Importantly, high levels of MA-linc1 are correlated with
decreased survival of breast and lung cancer patients and
its silencing sensitizes cancer cells to the apoptotic effect
of the M phase specific chemotherapeutic drug, Paclitaxel.
This enhancement of Paclitaxel-induced apoptosis is also
Purα-related.

(Figure S1C). Furthermore, the putative promoter of
MA-linc1 contains two E2F consensus binding sites
(Figure  S2A), and indeed, E2F1 bound this putative
promoter, as detected by ChIP analysis performed after
activation of ectopic E2F1 (Figure S2B). Also, luciferase
assay demonstrated that the DNA fragment upstream to
MA-linc1 indeed functions as a promoter and its promoter
activity is enhanced 3 fold by E2F1 (Figure S2C).
MA-linc1 is located on chromosome 5
(chr5:139482507–139487228) at a position corresponding
to band 5q31.2 on the somatic map, it is transcribed from
the minus strand and is composed of 3 exons.
Since many E2F-regulated genes encode proteins
that affect cell cycle progression, we next tested whether
MA-linc1 plays a role in this biological process. Indeed,
reducing the endogenous MA-linc1 RNA levels in U2OS
cells using two distinct siRNAs reproducibly resulted in
cell cycle redistribution (Figure 1A, 1B). Specifically,
upon knockdown of MA-linc1, we observed a significant
decrease in the number of cells in G1 and a significant
increase in the number of cells in all other stages of the
cell cycle, on average a 35% increase in S phase and a
70% increase in G2/M (Figure 1B, 1C). We hypothesized
that the G2/M enrichment detected upon knockdown of
MA-linc1 may be due to an impairment of M phase exit.
To directly determine whether MA-linc1 plays a role in
M-phase exit, U2OS cells were arrested at M phase by
Nocodazole and then induced to reenter the cell cycle
by incubation in fresh media. Following Nocodazole
treatment, the percentage of cells with a 4N DNA content
rose to about 68%, and knockdown of MA-linc1, by two
distinct siRNAs (Figure 2A), did not have a significant
effect on this M-phase arrest (Figure 2B, middle).
Importantly, the silencing of MA-linc1 impaired M phase
exit; thus, after release from a Nocodazole-induced arrest,
fewer MA-linc1 knocked-down cells exited M phase into
G1, compared to cells transfected with a non-specific
siRNA (Figure 2B). This impairment of M phase exit was
reproducible and statistically significant (Figure 2C).
In an attempt to elucidate the molecular mode
of action of MA-linc1, we first studied its sub-cellular
localization. Cell fractionation experiments indicated that
MA-linc1 is present both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm
of cells (Figure 3A). In recent years, a number of wellcharacterized nuclear lncRNAs have been shown to
function via modulation of gene expression in cis [35].
Therefore, we focused on the nearest neighboring gene of
MA-linc1, Purα, which is located upstream to MA-linc1 in
a head-to-head orientation. Purα encodes a single-stranded
DNA- and RNA-binding protein, which binds a purine
rich element that is often present at origins of replication
and in gene flanking regions of eukaryotes [36]. MAlinc1 and Purα are both regulated by E2F1 (Figure S2
and [37]). qPCR analysis demonstrated that silencing of
MA-linc1 by two distinct siRNAs results in a moderate
increase in Purα mRNA levels (Figure 3B), suggesting

RESULTS
MA-linc1 (also termed ENST00000499203
(Ensembl) and Linc01024 (RefSeq)) was first identified
as an E2F1-regulated lncRNA in an RNA Seq.-based
screen we performed using the human osteosarcoma
cell line U2OS and the human lung carcinoma cell line
H1299, which express conditionally active E2F1 ([33];
Figure  S1A). Next, we employed qPCR to analyze
MA-linc1 levels in four cell lines: U2OS and H1299
cells, as well as the human embryonic lung fibroblasts,
WI38, and another human osteosarcoma cell line, SAOS2, each expressing the conditionally active E2F1. This
analysis demonstrated that activation of the ectopic E2F1
resulted in a significant increase in MA-linc1 RNA levels
in all four cell lines (Figure S1A, S1B). Activation of
a mutated E2F1 that does not bind DNA did not affect
MA-linc1 RNA levels, suggesting that E2F1 affects MAlinc1 RNA levels via a transcriptional mechanism (Figure
S1A). Notably, activation of ectopic E2F3 also resulted
in a significant increase in MA-linc1 RNA levels (Figure
S1A). This suggests that an activity common to E2F1 and
E2F3 is responsible for regulating MA-linc1 expression.
In support of direct regulation of MA-linc1 RNA
levels, activation of ectopic E2F1 in the presence of
cycloheximide did not mitigate MA-linc1 RNA induction

that MA-linc1 represses the expression of its neighboring
gene, Purα. Of note, this not only suggests that MA-linc1
affects gene expression in cis, but also offers insight to
the mechanism underlying the effect of MA-linc1 on cell
cycle progression, as Purα was shown to arrest cell cycle
progression [38, 39].
To test more directly whether MA-linc1 affects
cell cycle progression via modulation of Purα levels,
we examined the effects of silencing both genes
simultaneously. As can be seen in Figure 3B, the
simultaneous knock down of MA-linc1 and Purα also did
not have any detectable effect on Nocodazole-induced cell
cycle arrest. Importantly, while silencing of Purα alone
did not affect re-entry to the cell cycle, its simultaneous
silencing (together with MA-linc1) partially rescued
the impaired re-entry to the cell cycle observed upon
MA-linc1 silencing (Figure 3C). This partial rescue was
reproducible and statistically significant (Figure  3D).
These data indicate that MA-linc1 affects cell cycle

progression, at least in part, via regulating the levels of its
neighbor, Purα.
A number of anti-cancer drugs induce cell
death via inhibition of either the polymerization and
depolymerization of microtubules during M phase [40].
Since silencing of MA-linc1 increases the percentage
of cells in M phase, we speculated that it may enhance
the  cellular response to such drugs. The knockdown of
MA-linc1 alone did not cause significant cell death, and
less than 6% of the cells exhibited a Sub-G1 DNA content
(Figure 4A, top right panel). Administration of sub-lethal
doses of Paclitaxel, an anti-cancer drug that inhibits
the depolymerization of microtubules, induced some
apoptosis; 14% of the cells underwent apoptosis after 42 hr
(Figure 4A, bottom left panel). Combining these sub-lethal
doses of Paclitaxel with MA-linc1 silencing resulted in
substantially higher levels of apoptosis, of 26% (Figure 4A
bottom right panel). On average, the silencing of MAlinc1 led to a 90% increase in apoptosis (Figure 4B).

Similar results were obtained upon knock down by another
siRNA directed against MA-linc1 (data not shown). In
line with the data obtained by FACS, increased cleavage
of caspase 3 was detected after the combined treatment
of MA-linc1 silencing plus administration of Paclitaxel
(Figure 4C). Moreover, similar data were obtained when
we employed an Annexin V/PI analysis. Specifically, 22%
of the cells underwent apoptosis 66 hr after administration
of Paclitaxel and combining this dose of Paclitaxel with
MA-linc1 silencing resulted in apoptosis of 54% of the
cells (Figure 4D). Importantly, while silencing of Purα
alone did not inhibit Paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, its
simultaneous silencing (together with MA-linc1) impaired
the enhancement of Paclitaxel-induced apoptosis observed
upon MA-linc1 silencing (Figure 4D). These data further
support the notion that MA-linc1 exerts its biological
function, at least in part, via an effect on its neighbor, Purα.
Finally, to evaluate the physiological relevance
of MA-linc1 in human tumors, we tested whether its
levels correlate with patient survival in a cohort of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

355 Lung cancer patients and in a cohort of 90 Breast
cancer patients. Remarkably, upon stratification of the
lung cancer cohort into two subgroups: one with high
levels  of MA-linc1 and the other with low levels of
MA-linc1, it became apparent that the group with low
levels of MA-linc1 exhibited significantly increased
survival (Figure  5A). Similar results were obtained
when analyzing the breast cancer cohort of 90 patients
(Figure 5B). These data are consistent with the findings
that low MA-linc1 levels lead to inhibition of cell cycle
progression (shown in Figures 1, 2).

DISCUSSION
Long non coding RNAs are emerging as important
regulators of many biological processes including cell
cycle progression and tumorigenesis [18, 41]. We report
here the identification of a novel lncRNA, MA-linc1, that
affects cell cycle progression. In agreement with a possible

coding RNAs, including microRNAs and lncRNAs that
control cell cycle progression [34, 46–48]. Thus far, three
lncRNAs were shown to exhibit E2F-regulated expression.
These are H19, a lncRNA encoded by an imprinted gene
that exhibits remarkably elevated levels in a large number
of human cancers [32]; ANRIL, which is located at the
tumor suppressor locus encoding p16INK4A and p15INK4B and
represses the expression of these two tumor suppressors
[21, 34, 49]; and ERIC, which was shown to regulate
apoptosis that is induced by either E2F1 or DNA damage
[33]. MA-linc1 now joins this short list of E2F-regulated
lncRNAs, and our data indicate that like ANRIL it plays a
role in cell cycle progression. Of note, our results do not
exclude the possibility that MA-linc1 also affects the G1/S
transition, as its silencing in unsynchronized cells leads to
a decrease in the number of cells in G1 and a concomitant
increase in number of cells in S phase. Nevertheless, we

Specifically, upon silencing of MA-linc1, fewer cells
were released from mitotic checkpoint arrest and proceed
through M phase into a new cell cycle.

upstream TSS is about 160 bases upstream to MA-linc1
while its most downstream promoter is 6Kb upstream to
MA-linc1 [50]. The expression of MA-linc1 may represent
a divergent transcription to that of Purα from its most
upstream promoter, a situation which is observed for many
lncRNAs [51].
Purα is a regulator of cell proliferation; its ectopic
expression causes cell cycle arrest at either the G1/S or
G2/M transition points [52] and suppresses the growth
of several transformed and tumor cells including
glioblastomas [53]. Thus, its regulation by MA-linc1
provides a molecular mechanism underlying the effect of
MA-linc1 silencing on M phase exit. Indeed, co-silencing
of MA-linc1 and Purα partially rescues the M phase exit
defect exhibited by MA-linc1 knocked-down cells.
This Purα-dependent rescue is partial, indicating
that MA-linc1 most probably has additional targets.

MA-linc1 affects M-phase, at least in part, by
regulating the expression of its neighbor, Purα
Many lncRNAs act near their site of synthesis to
regulate the expression of genes in cis, often by binding
to chromatin modifiers that affect a neighboring gene(s)
[1, 11, 12]. Our data indicate that MA-linc1 also affects the
expression of its neighboring gene, Purα which is located
upstream to MA-linc1. The molecular mechanism(s)
underlying this regulation remain to be determined.
Purα is transcribed, in a head to head orientation
to MA-linc1, from three distinct promoters; its most

The survival data of the two subgroups is presented in Kaplan–Meier survival curves.

In agreement with this notion, our analysis of the
transcriptome after silencing of MA-linc1 show that
in addition to Purα the expression of a number of
proliferation-related genes is altered. The detailed effects
of MA-linc1 on expression of these genes expression and
their relevance to the effects of MA-linc1 on cell cycle
progression awaits further studies.

which inhibits the depolymerization of microtubules.
Importantly, our data strongly suggest that the effect of
MA-linc1 silencing on Paclitaxel-induced apoptosis is
also mediated by its effects on its neighboring gene Purα.
Taken together with the fact that Purα is often deleted
in some human cancers [38], this data suggests that
MA-linc1 may affect the initiation and progression of
cancer by regulating Purα levels.
Paclitaxel is commonly used to treat various
cancers including Breast, Ovarian, and Lung cancer [40].
Potentially, a clinically relevant corollary of our findings
is that tumors expressing low levels of MA-linc1 may be
more sensitive to treatment with Paclitaxel, and perhaps
to additional anti-cancer drugs that affect microtubule
dynamics.

MA-linc1 affects cancer patient survival and the
response of cancer cells to Paclitaxel
In agreement with a possible role for MA-linc1 in
M phase, we show here that while silencing of MA-linc1
causes little to no apoptosis, it sensitizes cancer cells
to the anti-cancer chemotherapeutic drug Paclitaxel,

More generally, analysis of breast and lung
cancer patients suggests that this lncRNA also impacts
cancer biology, in particular, survival irrespective of
chemotherapeutic treatment, as in both cohorts patients
with low levels of MA-linc1 lived longer.
In summary, our data suggest that silencing of
MA-linc1 may benefit cancer patients and specifically,
may improve their response to chemotherapeutic drugs,
such as Paclitaxel, that attack cells at the M phase.

as determined by the Bradford assay, were resolved by

chemiluminescence kit (ECL Amersham).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Transfection
Transfections of siRNA were performed
using the Interferin transfection reagent (PolyPlustransfection) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The siRNAs against MA-linc1 (siMA-linc1#1:
AAGAGTGGATCTATCTGAACTGGAT, siMA-linc1#2:
AAACTGTATGGAAGTGCCTCCGAAA),
Purα
(siPurα: GGCTCCAACAAGTACGGCGTGTTTA), and
a control sequence (siRNA universal negative control #1),
were synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich. Experiments were
performed 48 hours following siRNAs transfection.

Cell culture
U2OS and SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells were grown
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Early passage WI38
human embryonic lung fibroblasts were grown in minimal
essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate
and non-essential amino acids. H1299 human lung
adenocarcinoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were
maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing
8% CO2. To induce activation of ER-E2F1 or ER-E2F3,
cells were treated with 100 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(OHT, Sigma) for the times indicated. Where indicated,
cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma) was administered for 8 hr
at 10 μg/ml. Nocodazole (Sigma) was used at 60 ng/ml
for 18 hr.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
DNA–protein complexes were immunoprecipitated
from U2OS cells using the ChIP (chromatin
immunoprecipitation) assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology)
according to the manufacturer's protocol with the
following antibodies: anti-E2F1 (sc-251; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and anti-IgG (111–035-144, Jackson
Immunoresearch). Anti-IgG served as a control for
nonspecific DNA binding. The precipitated DNA
was subjected to RT- PCR analysis using specific
primers corresponding to the estimated human
MA-linc1 promoter (5′-GGGCTGAGGAGGAAGGAG-3′
and 5′- GACGTCGCCTGGAGTCAC -3′) as well as
primers for β-actin, which served as a negative control
(5′-ACGCCAAAACTCTCCCTCCTCCTC-3′
and
5′-CATAAAAGGCAACTTTCGGAACGGC-3′).

Quantitative PCR (Real-Time RT- PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the
Tri Reagent method. To obtain cDNA, RT was performed
using cDNA synthesis kit (Quanta). Real-time quantitative
PCR (qPCR) was performed using PerfeCTa SYBR Green
fastMix (Quanta) with the following primer pairs:
GAPDH: 5′-CATGTTCCAATATGATTCCACC-3′ and
5′-GATGGGATTTCCATTGATGAC-3′
MA-linc1:5′-TCATCCCAGTTAAAATGGCTTT-3′ and
5′-TTTCGGAGGCACTTCCATAC-3′
Purα: 5′-GACGACTACGGAGTGGAGGA-3′ and
5′-TCGCTCACTCGCATAAACAC-3′
Real-Time PCR was performed and analyzed in
The StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems). Results are presented as mean and SD for
duplicate runs.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis
For PI staining, cells were trypsinized and then
fixed by incubating in 70% ethanol at 4°C overnight. After
fixation, cells were centrifuged for 4 min at 1500 rpm, and
the pellet resuspended and incubated for 40 min at 4°C in
1 ml of PBS. Then, the cells were centrifuged again and
resuspended in PBS containing 5 mg/ml propidium iodide
and 50 μg/mL RNase A. After incubation for 20 min at
room temperature, fluorescence intensity was analyzed
using a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer.
For Annexin V/PI staining, cells were collected,
stained with annexin-V/PI according to the manufacturer’s

each cell (i,j) represents the raw abundance of reads
aligned to a transcript (i) in the aligned sample (j). These
tables, which are required for further normalization and
processing, were constructed differently for LUAD and
BRCA datasets. For the BRCA dataset, we extracted the
transcript abundance from the RSEM output, while for the
LUAD dataset, a transcript count table was created using
FeatureCounts [54] with a custom GTF file that was used
for BRCA alignment.
Next, transcript counts tables of both datasets were
normalized by using DESeq [55], a Bioconductor package
[56]. Further, each dataset was divided into two groups
according to MA-linc1 expression, “high” and “low”.
The clinical data on the survival of the patients was also
downloaded from TCGA, and was used for Kaplan–Meier
survival analysis.

Extraction of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA
RNA was extracted from nucleus and cytoplasm
according to the Invitrogen nuclear extraction protocol.
Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended
in 500 μl of Hypotonic Buffer followed by 15 minutes
incubation on ice. Then, 10% NP40 detergent was added
and the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 minutes at
3,000 rpm at 4°C. The RNA from the pellet, containing the
nuclear fraction, was extracted by the Tri Reagent method.
The RNA from the supernatant, containing the cytoplasm
fraction, was extracted by the Phenol-Chloroform method.
RNA levels of the nuclear and the cytoplasmic
fractions were monitored by RT Real Time PCR and were
normalized to levels of external DNA.

Dual-Luciferase assay was performed in U2OS
cells transfected with PolyJet In Vitro DNA Transfection
Reagent. Cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfection
and assayed for Dual-Luciferase activities as specified by
the manufacturer (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity
of each sample was normalized to the corresponding
Renilla luciferase activity. Each transfection was
performed in triplicate.

Cloning

FUNDING

Human genomic DNA was subjected to PCR
analysis using specific primers corresponding to the
MA-linc1 promoter (5′-CTTAGGCTCTGCGGGCTGAG
GAGGAAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGCCCGCGGAATGTT
GACG-3′). Sequence-verified MA-linc1 promoter was
cloned into firefly luciferase reporter.

For the survival analysis, two large RNA Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) datasets of Breast invasive
carcinoma (BRCA) and Lung Adeno Carcinoma (LUAD)
tumor samples were downloaded from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA).
These datasets included 90 unaligned and 355 prealigned samples of BRCA and LUAD respectively. RSEM
(http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471–2105/12/323), an
RNA-seq aligner, was implemented by TCGA for LUAD
dataset alignment. Therefore, for BRCA samples we used
the same aligner with standard parameters, hg19 reference
genome annotation and a custom GTF file, which included
annotation of known and predicted lncRNAs in addition
to all known genes. Next, transcript count tables for each
dataset were generated. In the transcript count table, the
rows (i) represent transcripts and the columns (j) samples;
