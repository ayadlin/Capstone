ABSTRACT
We report a new biomarker of hepatocarcinoma, vasorin (VASN), screened
by a subtractive EMSA-SELEX strategy from AFP negative serum of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) patients with extrahepatic metastases. VASN was verified to be
highly expressed in sera of 100 cases of HCC patients compared with 97 cases of
normal persons and 129 cases of hepatitis patients. Further validation by Q-PCR,IFA
and Western blot showed higher expression of VASN at mRNA and protein levels
in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues than in normal controls. RNA interference and
forced overexpression assays verified that VASN promotes cell proliferation and
migration and inhibits apoptosis. Down-regulation of microRNA miR145 and miR146a
is an important mechanism leading to high expression of VASN. Conclusion: As a
membrane protein and/or as free protein, VASN may be an effective target for
biological treatment of liver cancer and is a potential biomarker for HCC diagnosis.
Small molecular nucleotides targeting VASN are promising biological therapies to HCC.

INTRODUCTION

new HCC biomarkers either independent of or combined
with AFP for diagnostic, prognostic or predictive value[4,
5].
Many biotechnology methods such as genomics,
RNomics, proteomics, metabolomics and antibody
chip technology have been widely used for screening
and identification of new tumor biomarkers [6-9].
Unfortunately, until now, relatively few tumor markers
of clinical diagnostic value have been available due
to poor specificity and unsatisfactory reproducibility.
Methodological limitations may be the result of protein
enzymolysis or loss during sample preparation and the
unsuitability of some special samples containing low

Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is by far the most
commonly used serological biomarker in clinical practice
for liver cancer screening, early diagnosis, evaluation of
therapeutic efficacy and prognosis [1, 2]. However, the
clinical diagnostic accuracy of AFP is unsatisfactory due
to low sensitivity and specificity. About 30% to 40% of
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are serum
AFP negative clinically, a growing trend in recent years
[3]. These patients get poor diagnosis, prognosis and
efficacy evaluation for lack of effective liver cancer tumor
markers. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing

abundance protein or strongly alkaline proteins. By
providing specific recognition, monoclonal antibody
chip-based assays can be used for the isolation of
cancer biomarkers, but they are limited by difficulties
in generating tumor-specific antibodies. AptamerFacilitated Biomarker Discovery (AptaBiD) is a promising
technology for biomarker discovery [10-12]. AptaBiD
is based on individual or pooled aptamers, a new class
of molecular probe for specific recognition of different
molecular targets. Aptamers (from the Latin aptus - fit,
and Greek meros - part) are short single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) or RNA molecules with high affinity to a wide
variety of targets, ranging from small organic molecules
to complex proteins. Aptamers’ affinity is attributed to
their specific three-dimensional shapes. They are evolved
through an in vitro selection process known as systematic
evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment(SELEX), a
high-flux screening technique that involves the progressive
selection of highly specific ligands by repeated rounds of
selection and amplification from a large random synthetic
nucleic acid library [13, 14]. Because of their discriminate
recognition which rivals that of commonly used antibodies
[15], easy synthesis and modification, less severe
immunogenicity and small size, aptamers are of growing
interest in biotechnological and therapeutic applications.
AptaBiD was first developed to isolate cell biomarkers
and we previously developed it for tissue biomarkers [16],
but here we utilize AptaBid to identify a clincally noninvasive serum biomarker.
AptaBiD involves three major stages: (i) differential
selection of aptamers or pools of aptamers through
SELEX; (ii) aptamer-based isolation of biomarkers; and
(iii) mass spectrometry identification of biomarkers.
Usually, the first stage involves a counter selection that
is guaranteed to generate aptamers that differentiate
selection targets from counter-selected partners which are
highly homologous to targets but show some distinctive
molecular differences [17-19]. The important feature
of the counter selection is that it does not require prior
knowledge of the complex and is not restricted by the
properties of the targets, providing a new approach
for biomarker verification by the obtained specific
aptamers. Another crucial step for a successful selection
is the separation of target bound oligonucleotides
from unbound oligonucleotides. Unlike selection to
intact biological entities such as cells, organelles and
tissues, for which bound oligonucleotides can be easily
separated from free ones by centrifugation or through
binding to mounted tissue slides, the separation is a
more challenging task for soluble complex targets such
as serum. Most methods use target immobilization on
nitrocellulose, magnetic beads or column materials, e.g.
sepharose or agarose[20]. However, either substantial
amounts of target molecules are necessary to achieve
sufficiently high loading of the column, or pre-removal
of highly abundant non-target proteins are required
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

because of limited binding capacities of medium such as
nitrocellulose and magnetic beads, especially for selection
of trace level targets in a very complex system such as
cell lysate and serum. Sahar Javaherian et al report a new
separation with non-equilibrium capillary electrophoresis
of equilibrium mixtures [21, 22], but this method needs
a capillary electrophoresis (CE) apparatus equipped with
a fluorescence detector and requires sufficiently high
target levels in lysate. Here, we report using subtractiveEMSA which separates bound nucleotides with free ones
according to gel mobility rates. It requires only very small
amounts of target, no pre-treatment of targets or specific
apparatus. For the positive selection, we recover DNA
from gel that shifts more slowly than the free library; for
the negative selection, we recover DNA identical to the
free library. We developed a subtractive liquid SELEX,
subtractive-EMSA-SELEX, targeted AFP negative serum
sample of HCC patients with extrahepatic metastases
for HCC serum biomarker identification. Using normal
serum as a counter target in the selection round and using
EMSA to separate aptamers bound with serum differential
molecules from free nucleotides, enriched pools were
obtained and verified to discriminate HCC serum and
normal serum after 5 rounds of selection. The enriched
pool was analysed by MS to identify candidate biomarkers.
In this report, we will focus on one of these, vasorin, for
its biomarker validation and biological function.
Vasorin (VASN) was first elucidated as a cell surface
and secreted protein that modulates the arterial response
to injury through inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway
[23, 24]. It is expressed at its highest levels in the aorta,
at intermediate levels in kidney and placenta tissue and
at its lowest levels in brain, heart, liver, lung and skeletal
muscle tissue. VASN is further identified as a substrate
of ADAM17, a metalloprotease, which generates a
soluble fragment encompassing the extracellular domain
of VASN, which inhibits TGF-β signaling [25]. Despite
the importance of TGF-β in tumor progression, the status
and function of VASN in tumors are seldom reported.
Caccia et al identified VASN as a predictive biomarker
that is sensitive to RPI-1 and dasatinib treatments
in thyroid cancer cells by analyzing tumor cell-line
secretomes [26]. VASN is also reported as a HIF-1 target
that regulates mitochondrial redox pathways and as a
potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in
human glioblastoma [27]. There is no report of vasorin
in hepatocarcinoma until now. We report herein first that
VASN is a prospective biomarker of HCC. We next find
that down-regulated microRNA miR145 and miR146a
are an important mechanism leading to high expression
of VASN. Finally, small nucleotide (siRNA or aptamers)
targeting VASN could be promising therapeutics for HCC.

simultaneously to exclude proteins of similar mobility to
the complex. We performed MALDI-TOF MS (MatrixAssisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization Time of Flight Mass
Spectrometry) followed by secondary peptide sequencing
MS analysis for the identification of the mixture proteins.
Significant protein hits had individual ions scores greater
than 38, indicating identity or extensive homology
(p<0.05) (Supplementary Table 1, Table 1). Among these
potential biomarkers, peptides identified in Chain A, ApoHuman Serum Transferrin (Non-Glycosylated) also match
transferrin (gi|4557871) that is also in the control band.
Ceruloplasmin, Complement factor B or complement
component C3 had already been reported elevated in
hepatocarcinoma and other cancers[28-30]. The protein
VASN showed a relatively high score probability and has
never been studied on HCC.

Identification of VASN as a differentially
expressed protein from AFP negative and positive
serum samples from HCC patients by subtractive
– EMSA - SELEX
To identify HCC serum biomarker, we developed
a subtractive - EMSA-SELEX strategy targeting AFP
negative serum samples of HCC patients with extra hepatic
metastases (Fig. 1a). After each round of selection, the
enriched pool was labeled with FAM (carboxyfluorescein)
by a modified 5’ primer through unequal length PCR.
Enrichment of each round of selection was monitored by
EMSA of the labeled pool and the targets or the counter
targets complex. Selection rounds were repeated until
there was an obvious binding of enriched pool with targets
and until the enriched pool could discriminate targets from
counter-targets. In this study, the fifth pool demonstrated
an obvious enrichment and discrimination between
counter target and target as well as between normal serum
and AFP negative HCC serum (Figs. 1b, 1c).
The slowly migrated band of enriched fifth pool
and target serum complex in EMSA was excised and the
protein components in it were recovered and subjected to
mass spectrometry analysis. The corresponding position
in the control lane (containing the initial library and
target serum complex) was excised and identified by MS

VASN has verified high expression in HCC patient
sera, tissues and cell lines
We collected sera from 100 proven cases of HCC,
129 cases of hepatitis B and from 97 normal individuals.
The VASN level was determined by quantitative
ELISA as described in the methods section. The results
confirmed the elevation of circulating VASN of HCC
patients compared to that of the control cohorts, (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary Table 2). The area under the curve (AUC)
of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by
SPSS17.0 software was 0.770 (Fig. 2b). The cut-off value

was set up as 1.5061ng/ml based on the Youden index
so that the sensitivity reached 69% with a specificity of
80.5%. Furthermore, among the 37 cases of AFP negative
sera (37%) , 23 cases (62 %) were VASN positive (≥
1.5061ng/ml) (Fig. 2c), which suggested that combining
the use of AFP and VASN could improve the sensitivity
of liver cancer diagnosis. In this report, the diagnostic
sensitivity would be increased to 86% from 63% and 69%
if combined use of AFP and VASN respectively compared

mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. VASN mRNA

highly expressed in the control group was used as an
external reference. The results confirmed that VASN
mRNA was more highly expressed in HCC tissues than

Low levels of miR145 and miR146a are negatively
correlated with the level of VASN in hepatoma
cells and HCC patient sera

those in hepatocirrhosis, hepatitis or pericarcinoma tissues
(Fig. 2d), providing additional evidence for vasorin as a
potential HCC marker.
The expression of VASN mRNA and protein in
various human cancer and normal cell lines was measured
by real-time PCR and Western blot respectively. The
results confirmed that vasorin was relatively highly
expressed in human hepatoma HepG2, SMMC-7721 cells
(Figs. 2e, 2f).
The expression and localization of VASN protein
were verified for 7 cases of HCC and benign lesion (virus
hepatitis and hepatocirrhosis) liver tissue slides as well as
coverslips with adherent hepatic cancerous and normal
cells by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Evans blue
contrast staining was used to reduce the background of
non-specific autofluorescence and to help distinguish the
specific FITC labelling from the red background [17]. We
quantitated the vasorin in situ expression by staining as:
(-) = <5% of cells stained; (+) = 5%-25% of cells stained;
(+ +) = 26%–50% of cells stained; (+ + +) = 51%–75%
of cells stained; and (+ + + +) = > 75% of cells stained.
The semi-quantitative results showed higher expression
of VASN in HCC and lower expression in benign lesions
(Supplementary Table 3). Expression was mainly located
in the cytoplasm, cell surface and cell gaps (Fig. 2g). In
situ cell detection showed a consistent result (Fig. 2h).

It is well known that miRNAs play important roles
in regulating protein expression in cells. They even are
mentioned as a new class of biomarker for tumor detection
because of their abnormal expression in tumors. To
identify which miRNAs might functionally target VASN in
hepatoma cells, bioinformatic analysis with TargetScan5.1
was completed. There were 7 potential miRNA target
sites in the 629bp full length 3′ UTR of VASN mRNA:
miR146a, miR146b, miR145, miR205, miR214, miR761
and miR3619 (Fig. 4a). Among these miRNAs, realtime PCR indicated that miR146a, miR145, miR205 and
miR3619 had relatively lower expression in hepatoma
cell lines of HepG2 and SMMC-7721, which have high
expression of VASN (Fig. 4b). VASN mRNA levels were
significantly reduced after transient transfection of mimics
of miR145, miR146a and miR761 into HepG2 cells (Fig.
4c). Furthermore, we examined the levels of the above 7
miRNAs in clinical HCC patient sera. We found that the
levels of miR145, miR146a and miR146b were lower in
5 cases of AFP negative hepatoma patients sera compared
with those in 4 cases of normal sera (Fig. 4d), showing a
negative correlation with the expression level of VASN
(Fig. 4e). This negative correlation was further verified in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells HepG2, SMMC-7721 and
normal liver cells L02 on the mRNA level (Fig. 4f). All
these results suggested that VASN could be a functional
target of miR145 and miR146a, and that low expression of
miR145 and miR146a may result in the abnormally high
expression of VASN in hepatoma cells.
A dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed
to test our hypothesis. We constructed a series of PGL3
reporter gene vectors carrying wild type VASN 3′ UTR
fragment or mutant fragments of miRNA target sites. The
reporter vectors and miRNA mimics were co-transfected
into HepG2 cells. The results showed that miR145 and
miR146a could down regulate the luciferase activity of
report vectors carrying wild type VASN 3′ UTR, but had
no effect on the miR145 mutant VASN 3′ UTR or the
miR146a mutant VASN 3′ UTR reporter vectors (Figs 4g,
4h).

VASN increases hepatoma cell proliferation and
migration and inhibits apoptosis
The function of highly expressed VASN
was explored by silencing VASN expression with
siRNA in cancerous HepG2 cells and forced VASN
overexpression in normal L02 cells. Proliferation was
measured by MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium) viability assays, apoptosis was measured by
flow cytometry assays, and migration was measured by
transwell chamber assays 48-96 hours after transfection.
Silencing expression of VASN in HepG2 cells (Figs.
3a, 3b, 3c) resulted in decreased cell proliferation (Fig.
3d), increased apoptosis (Fig. 3e) and reduced migration
(Fig. 3f) compared with the control groups. Forced
overexpression of full-length GFP-tagged VASN in
normal liver cells (Fig. 3g, 3h) resulted in increased cell
proliferation which can be abolished by VASN specific
siRNA (Fig. 3i). Transwell chamber migration assays
confirmed that overexpressed VASN causes increased cell
migration in normal liver cells (Fig. 3j). Since VASN is
expressed on the cell surface, these results suggested that
VASN could be an effective biological target of cancer
treatment.

Discussion

Random ssDNA library and primers

AFP is by far the most commonly used serological
biomarker in clinical practice for liver cancer screening,
early diagnosis, evaluation of therapeutic efficacy and
prognosis [18, 19]. However, the clinical diagnostic
accuracy of AFP is unsatisfactory due to low sensitivity
and specificity. About 30% to 40% of patients with HCC
are serum AFP negative clinically, a growing trend in
recent years [20]. These patients receive poorer diagnosis,
prognosis and efficacy evaluation for lack of a more
effective liver cancer tumor marker. Therefore, there is
an urgent need to develop new HCC biomarkers either
independently of or combined with AFP for diagnostic,
prognostic or predictive value in HCC [21, 22].
In our study, VASN was screened as a differentially
abundant component between HCC serum and normal
control serum by subtractive EMSA-SELEX. It was
further confirmed as a potential biomarker for HCC.
Our results showed that the level of VASN was higher in
sera of 100 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma compared
with 97 normal cases and 129 cases of B type hepatitis,
consistent with the higher expression of VASN in HCC
cell lines and HCC tissues both at the mRNA and protein
levels. No relationship between VASN and AFP was
found, implying a combination of vasorin and AFP could
increase the sensitivity of diagnosis. It is interesting that
VASN, as a membrane protein, was found to promote cell
proliferation and migration, which may also be a potential
drug target for treatment of liver cancer.

The subtractive – EMSA – SELEX

Detection of expression of VASN in serum of liver
cancer by ELISA

For the first round of selection, 1500 pmole of initial
library was incubated with 5µl normal serum in binding
buffer (PBS, 5mmol/L MgCl2) for 1 h. The complex
was then separated by electrophoresis on an 8% native
polyacrylamide gel. The nucleotides that did not bind to
serum components and thus shifted equally with the same
as the free library control were recovered from the gel.
The recovered single stranded DNA was amplified through
unequal length PCR16 to achieve a subtractive library.
The subtractive library (400 pmole) was then subjected
to positive selection: the pool was incubated with 5 µl
target serum and the bound nucleotide which showed a
slower mobility rate on the native PAGE gel was excised
and recovered. Finally, recovered DNA was amplified by
unequal length PCR to generate an enriched pool for the
next round of selection. In this study, we performed the
subtractive selection against one case of normal serum
for the first, second and third rounds and against another
case of normal serum on the fourth and fifth rounds. We
executed positive selection to 1 case of AFP negative
HCC serum through all five rounds. Supplementary Table
3 summarizes the detailed conditions for each round of
selection. Selection rounds were repeated until there was
an obvious binding of enriched pool with targets and the
enriched pool could discriminate targets from countertargets.

The VASN level in serum samples from 100
patients with liver cancer and 97 healthy persons obtained
clinically were detected with the quantitative ELISA kit
according to manufacturer’s instructions except that we
used the QuantaRedTM Enhanced Chemifluorescent HRP
Substrate for higher sensitivity. Briefly, 100 µl substrate
solution was added to each well , incubated for no longer
than 20 min at 37oC and protected from light. 10 µl stop
solution was added when gradient color changes were
obvious in the first 3-4 wells while not in the last 3-4
wells. Finally, the reaction was read spectrophotmetrically
at ~570nm.

Silencing VASN expression
siRNAs to VASN and negative control, miRNA
mimics and inhibitors were synthesized by Guangzhou
ruibo company. The transfection of small RNAs was
conducted in 6-well plates using the Lipofectamine 2000
transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following
the manufacturer’s manual. Inhibitors to miRNA were
transfected at a molecular ratio of 3:1 to miRNA. The total
RNA and the whole cell lysate was prepared 48 h after
transfection and subjected to real-time PCR or Western
Blot.

Identification of the enriched selection pool

Overexpressing VASN in normal hepatocyte

After each round of selection, the enriched pool was
labeled with FAM using FAM modified primer Plong-1
through unequal length PCR. Enrichment of each round
of selection was monitored by EMSA of labeled pool and
targets or counter target complex, and visualized under
laser excitation.

The cDNA of VASN (GenBank accession number
NM­_138440) was obtained by reverse transcription
from HepG2 total RNA using the M-MLV Reverse
Transcriptase Kit according to manufacturer’s manual. The
cDNA was amplified and subsequently inserted into vector
pEGFP N1. Clones obtaining the expression plasmid
pEGFP N1/VASN were confirmed by sequence analysis.
The plasmid was transfected into normal hepatocyte L02
cell lines using lipofection reagent to gain a transient
overexpression of vasorin. The expression was confirmed
by fluorescent microscope imaging and Western Blot 48 h
after transfection.

Identification of candidate serological biomarkers
The enriched fifth pool and target serum were
incubated and the complex were separated on 8% native
polyacrylamide gel. The retarded band was excised and
the protein components in it were recovered, digested
with porcine trypsin and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS
followed by secondary peptide sequencing MS analysis
and a Mascot database search for the identification of the
mixture proteins. The corresponding position in the control
lane (the complex of the initial library and target serum)
was excised and identified by MS simultaneously to
exclude the protein mobilized similarly with the complex.
The candidate serological biomarkers of hepatoma were
thus gained.

Immunofluorescence assay
Tissue slides and coverslips with adherent cells were
pre-incubated with blocking reagents (2% BSA) and then
incubated with VASN antibody (1:100 dilution) at 37oC for
2 h, followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat antimouse secondary antibody (1:50 dilution) at 37oC for 1 h.
0.25% Evans blue dye was used to eliminate nonspecific
fluorescent background. 100 ng/ml DAPI was used to stain
the nucleus.The fluorescence patterns of each experimental

group were scanned with a Zeiss LSM 510META confocal
microscope or fluorescence miscroscope using the same
instrument settings.

Detection of expression of VASN
hepatocarcinoma tissues by Q-PCR

Preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and
Western blot analysis were performed as described
previously. Briefly, 80 µg of total protein was loaded and
separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE), using 10% acrylamide gels,
then transferred to polyvinylidine diﬂuoride (PVDF). The
expression of VASN was determined using primary antiVASN antibody (1:500 dilution) followed by HRP-goat
anti-mouse/rabbit IgG. The blots were detected using the
enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection
system.

in

Tissue cDNA chips including cDNA from 68
cases of liver cancer tissue, pericarcinoma tissues
and hepatocirrhosis that were β-actin calibrated were
purchased. The expression of VASN mRNA was measured
by real-time PCR.

Prediction of miRNAs targeting VASN

MTS cell proliferation assay

Online bioinformatic software (http://www.
targetscan.org) was used to predict of the potential
miRNAs regulating VASN and potential miRNA target
sites in the 3′ UTR of VASN gene.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plate at a density of
2×103 per well in 100 µl media and cultured for 24 h to
reach a 40–50% confluency. The cells were transfected
with small RNA molecules or DNA constructs and
cultured for a further 24-96 h. 20 μl MTS(CellTiter
96AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay,
Promega, USA) and 100 µl fresh medium were added
into each well and then incubated for 1 h. The absorbance
of the wells was determined using a plate reader at a test
wavelength of 490 nm.

Real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells or serum
samples using the TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The concentration of total RNA was measured
by a GeneQuant spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, USA). cDNA was generated using the M-MLV
Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Promega, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time RT-PCR was
performed with SYBR Green PCR Kit (Promega, USA)
on an Mx3000P QPCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA, USA). CT values were determined using Mx3000p
software (version 4.10) with an amplification-based
threshold determination and adaptive baseline analysis
options.

Scratch healing assay
Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of
5×105 per well in 2 ml media and cultured overnight. At
60–70% confluency, the cells were transfected with small
RNA molecules or DNA constructs and cultured for a
further 24 h. Upon reaching 90% confluency, a scratch was
created with a 200 µl-pipette tip and wells were washed
three times with PBS to remove loose cells. Then cells
were incubated in fresh medium and cell scratches were
photographed every 6 h.

Assay of luciferase activity

Migration assay

The VASN 3′ UTR was amplified by PCR from
genomic DNA of HepG2 cells and cloned into the pGL3control vector (Promega, USA) to construct vasorin
3′ UTR miRNA reporter plasmids. Mutant sequences
were produced by a Mutagenesis Kit (Takara, USA) and
inserted into the pGL3-control vector to construct vasorin
3′ UTR miRNA mutant reporter plasmids. HepG2 cells
were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected in triplicate
with luciferase reporters (1 μg), pRL-CMV (10 ng, as a
control for transfection efficiency and sample handling)
and miRNA mimics (100 pmol). Cells were harvested at
48 h post-transfection and assayed with Dual Luciferase
Assay (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates, transfected
with nucleotide acids of interest and cultured for further
24 h as described before. The cells were then cultured in
serum-free medium for another 24 h. Cells were detached
with trypsin, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in
complete medium and seeded in the upper chamber of a
Transwell (Corning , NY, USA) at a density of 5×104 in
100 µl media, and placed in a 24-well plate containing 500
µl complete medium. After incubation for 12-24 h at 37oC,
the cells on the bottom side of the chamber were ﬁxed
with formaldehyde for 30 min, then stained by crystal
violet or DAPI as described. Migrating cells were counted
manually in four random microscopic fields.
