Abstract
Estrogen receptor-A (ERA) and its ligand estradiol play
critical roles in breast cancer growth and are important
therapeutic targets for this disease. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip, ligand-bound ERA was recently found to function as a master transcriptional regulator
via binding to many cis-acting sites genome-wide. Here, we
used an alternative technology (ChIP cloning) and identified
94 ERA target loci in breast cancer cells. The ERA-binding
sites contained both classic estrogen response elements and
nonclassic binding sequences, showed specific transcriptional
activity in reporter gene assay, and interacted with the key
transcriptional regulators, including RNA polymerase II and
nuclear receptor coactivator-3. The great majority of the
binding sites were located in either introns or far distant to
coding regions of genes. Forty-three percent of the genes that
lie within 50 kb to an ERA-binding site were regulated by
estradiol. Most of these genes are novel estradiol targets
encoding receptors, signaling messengers, and ion binders/
transporters. mRNA profiling in estradiol-treated breast
cancer cell lines and tissues revealed that these genes are
highly ERA responsive both in vitro and in vivo. Among
estradiol-induced genes, Wnt11 was found to increase cell
survival by significantly reducing apoptosis in breast cancer
cells. Taken together, we showed novel genomic binding sites
of ERA that regulate a novel set of genes in response to
estradiol in breast cancer. Our findings suggest that at least a
subset of these genes, including Wnt11, may play important
in vivo and in vitro biological roles in breast cancer. [Cancer

Introduction
Estrogen receptor-a (ERa; ref. 1) is a ligand-activated nuclear
receptor that regulates transcription of estrogen-responsive genes
important for cell growth, differentiation, and malignant transformation in various target cells (2). ERa and its ligand estradiol
[17h-estradiol (E2)] play critical roles in the growth of breast cancer
tissue and are important therapeutic targets (3). Significant
progress has been made in understanding the role of ERa as a
transcription factor that regulates the expression of target genes
by directly binding to an estrogen response element (ERE; ref. 4) or

by association with other transcription factors on promoter targets
(1, 4, 5). Until recently, however, little had been known about
the distribution of ERa-binding sites within the genome and the
identity of genes regulated by these cis-acting elements.
Two recent pioneering publications by Carroll et al. (6, 7)
revolutionized our understanding of ERa action. Using chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip, this group mapped a large
number of ERa-binding sites on a chromosome and genome-wide
scale, identifying novel cis-regulatory sites and target genes in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells (6, 7). The majority of these binding sites
were distant from the transcription start sites of regulated genes
(6, 7).
Identification of novel genomic targets and a deeper understanding of their transcriptional regulation by ERa and their physiologic
function may lead to the development of more specific and effective
treatments for breast cancer. In the current study, we used a
technique alternative to ChIP-on-chip (i.e., ChIP-linked target site
cloning) for unbiased and potentially genome-wide identification of
regulatory targets of estradiol/ERa in breast cancer cells. Our aims
were to determine the nature of ERa binding relative to the structure
of a gene and increase our understanding of ERa action both in
normal tissue and in the malignant state. We characterized these
binding sites and regulation of proximal genes by estradiol/ERa both
in vitro and in vivo. The majority of the 38 estrogen-regulated genes
turned out to be previously unknown ERa targets. We showed in
detail previously unknown biological roles of one of these estrogen/
ERa–regulated genes, Wnt11, in breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and tissues. MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 cells (American
Type Culture Collection) were maintained in MEM (Invitrogen) containing
25 units/mL penicillin, 25 units/mL streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) at 37jC and 5% CO2. Snap-frozen ER+ (n = 25) and ER
(n = 20) breast cancer tissues were obtained from the Northwestern Breast
Specialized Programs in Research Excellence Tissue Core Facility. These
tissues were collected after obtaining written informed consent approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. After MCF-7 cells were grown to
75% to 80% confluence in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, the cells were
serum starved in DMEM/F-12 without phenol red (Invitrogen) and FBS for
24 h. After 3 h of treatment with 10 9 mol/L E2, cells were washed twice
with cold PBS and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature
for 10 min. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding glycine
containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma) to a final concentration
of 125 nmol/L for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed twice
with cold PBS, harvested, and stored at 80jC before use. Cell pellets were
lysed and sonicated to shear the DNA into 0.6- to 3.0-kb fragments.
Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the extract was
precleared by incubation with blocked protein A-agarose/Salmon Sperm
DNA (Upstate) for at least 1 h at 4jC to reduce nonspecific interactions.

After centrifugation, the supernatant (50 AL) was collected as input, and
the remainder was diluted in buffer [1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA,
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)] and subjected to immunoprecipitation
overnight at 4jC with a monoclonal antibody against ERa (Upstate).
After immunoprecipitation, 60 AL protein A-agarose/Salmon Sperm DNA
beads were added and the incubation was continued for another 1 h. To
decrease nonspecific binding, DNAs/protein complexes were washed under
high-stringency wash conditions. Precipitates were washed sequentially for
10 min, two times in buffer I [0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA,
20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl], six times in buffer II [0.1%
SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500
mmol/L NaCl], two times in buffer III [0.25 mol/L LiCl, 1% NP40, 1%
deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)], and twice
with 1 mmol/L EDTA and 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Precipitated
chromatin complexes were removed from the beads through a 15-min
incubation with 50 AL of 1% SDS and 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3 and vortexing at
room temperature. This step was done twice. Eluates were pooled and
heated at 65jC overnight to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA
fragments were purified with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup kit (Qiagen). The
immunoprecipitated and input DNA samples were assayed for binding to
the MYC promoter region as a positive control before ChIP cloning. For
PCR, 1 AL of purified DNA extraction and 40 cycles of amplification were
used.
Cloning, sequencing, and analysis of ERA-binding fragments. ChIPderived DNA was subjected to AvaII restriction digestion and PCR linker
ligation followed by PCR amplification (40 cycles) generating sufficient
material for cloning into the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega). Clones
were sequenced and every retrieved ChIP fragment was mapped to the
human genome using the BLAT search function of University of California
Santa Cruz genome browser or ENSEMBL search. The presence of EREs was
analyzed by ERE Finder (8), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) sites were
identified using the Transcription Element Search System.3
Microarray-based mRNA profiling. MCF-7 cells at 70% to 80%
confluence maintained in MEM as described above were treated with
vehicle or E2 at a concentration of 10 9 mol/L for 3 and 6 h. Total RNA was
extracted as described below. Gene expression profiles of the MCF-7 cells
were analyzed on Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarray chips
(Affymetrix), which contained 54,613 probe sets. Sample labeling and
subsequent hybridization to the array were carried out according to the
manufacturer’s instructions in the Microarray Core Facility within the
Center for Genetic Medicine, Northwestern University. Expression data
normalization was done as described previously (9).
Validation of the in vivo ERa-binding sites by real-time PCR. To
examine the enrichment of specific ERa-binding fragments in an
independent ChIP assay, primers were generated corresponding to the
regions examined within each ChIP-derived genomic fragment. Primers
were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. For each PCR assay, DNA
after ChIP of ERa and IgG as well as input DNA was quantified by
PicoGreen dsDNA dye (Invitrogen) from E2-treated or vehicle (ethanol)
MCF-7 cells. Real-time PCR was done using Applied Biosystems SYBR Green
Master kit following manufacturer’s instructions. The estrogen-mediated
fold enrichment of ERa-binding regions relative to IgG was compared with
its vehicle (ethanol) control. For every fragment analyzed, enrichment was
measured after three independent immunoprecipitations. To further
validate the in vivo binding of ERa to its putative binding regions, ChIP
of nuclear receptor coactivator-3 (NCOA3; also known as SRC-1), RNA
polymerase II (PolII; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and IgG were done.
RNA preparation and validation of ChIP-derived target gene
expression by real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the MCF-7,
T47D, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer tissue
samples (n = 45; wet weight  100 mg) using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) according
to the manufacturer’s instruction. Total RNA samples were treated with
DNase I (Ambion) for 20 min at 37jC according to the product manual. One

microgram of total RNA was then reverse transcribed in a final volume of
20 AL using Reverse Transcriptase III (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was done
for measurement of gene expression. A dissociation curve was analyzed for
each sample to ensure that a single amplification product was obtained.
For real-time PCR, 10 AL of 2 SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems), 5 to 10 Amol/L forward and reverse primers of each gene, and
1 AL cDNA template were added in a 20 AL reaction in triplicate. Forty
cycles of PCR amplification (95jC for 30 s and 60jC for 1 min) were done on
an Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 or 7900 HT Sequence Detection System.
Data are reported as the mean fold change F SD for experiments done in
triplicate.
Plasmids, transfections, and luciferase assays. ERa-binding regions
identified from ChIP cloning for Wnt11, Adora1, and SAPS2 were amplified by
PCR. To investigate the effect of orientation of ERa-binding fragments on
transcriptional activities, ERa-binding fragments were cloned in both the
sense and the antisense orientations in reporter gene expression vectors.
For orientation cloning, primers were used to introduce KpnI and XhoI sites
into amplified fragments of Wnt11 and Adora1 and KpnI and SacI sites
into the fragment of SAPS2. The primers for the sense fragments were the
following: Wnt11, 5¶-GGTACCAGTTGTTAGGAATGGCTATGTTCC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CTCGAGTAGGCTACCAAGTCTATGGTATTCTG-3¶ (reverse);
Adora1, 5¶-GGTACCTCTGTCTATGCACACCATGCA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶CTCGAGCCAGTCTGAAAACTGGTAATAATACCT-3¶ (reverse); and SAPS2,
5¶-GGTACCGTCCAACTGGTTTCAACT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GAGCTCCGTAACCGGAGTCCATGTTT-3¶ (reverse). The primers for the antisense
fragments were the following: Wnt11, 5¶-CTCGAGAGTTGTTAGGAATGGCTATGTTCC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGTACCTAGGCTACCAAGTCTATGGTATTCTG-3¶ (reverse); Adora1, 5¶-CTCGAGTCTGTCTATGCACACCATGCA3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGTACCAGTCTGAAAACTGGTAATAATACCT-3¶
(reverse); and SAPS2, 5¶-GAGCTCGTCCAACTGGTTTCAACT-3¶ ( forward)
and 5¶-GGTACCGTAACCGGAGTCCATGTTT-3¶ (reverse).
The PCR profile was 3 min at 94jC, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94jC,
30 s at 57jC, and 30 s at 72jC, and a final extension of 10 min at 72jC. The
amplified fragments were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. The PCR fragments
were directly cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector System as described in
the manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced to check their fidelity. The
inserts were then released from the vector by appropriate restriction
enzymes indicated above and subcloned into a pGL4-SV40 vector in sense
and antisense orientations. Briefly, SV40 promoter was cloned in the
location between a synthetic poly(A) signal/transcriptional pause site and
the luc2 gene of the pGL4.10[luc2] vector (Promega). All constructs were
reconfirmed by sequencing.
Hormone-depleted MCF-7 cells were transfected with each of the ERabinding domain vectors with Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied
Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reporter plasmid (0.2 Ag)
and pCMVhGal internal control (0.1 Ag) were transfected per well. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, DMEM/F-12 was added containing ethanol (vehicle) or
E2 (10 7 mol/L), and total protein lysate was collected and assayed for luciferase
and h-galactosidase activities after 20- to 24-h treatment.
Transfection of small interfering RNA. RNA interference was carried
out by using SMARTpool small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed against
Wnt11 and siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA as a negative control
(Dharmacon). After 3 days of culture in MEM containing 10% charcoalstripped calf serum, siRNA against Wnt11 or control siRNA at a final
concentration of 100 nmol/L was transiently transfected into the MCF-7 cells
for 48 h. The cells were then stimulated with E2 (10 7 mol/L) or vehicle for
20 to 24 h and harvested for analysis. Total RNA and protein were prepared
from harvested cells using Tri-Reagent. Knockdown efficiency of target
genes was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot.
Cell viability and apoptosis assay. Cell viability was determined by
trypan blue exclusion. After various treatments, cells were harvested,
washed, and treated with trypan blue at a concentration of 0.4% (w/v).
After 10 min, trypan blue uptake (indicating dead cells) was determined by
counting on a hemocytometer. Apoptosis in cells was evaluated by a
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage Western blot assay.
Cell cycle distribution analysis. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with control siRNA or Wnt11 siRNA (100 nmol/L) for 48 h; the cells

were then stimulated for 20 to 24 h with E2 (10 7 mol/L) or vehicle and
harvested for cell cycle distribution analysis using propidium iodide (PI)
staining and flow cytometry as in Keeton and Brown (10) with slight
modification. Briefly, 1  106 cells were harvested and washed with PBS and
then fixed in cold 70% ethanol at 20jC for 2 h. Fixed cells were treated
with 1 mL PI solution (50 Ag/mL PI, 0.2 mg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X100) for 20 min at 37jC and analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry by
a core facility.
Western blotting. Western blot was done for cleaved PARP analysis and
for detection of Wnt11 protein level knockdown. Aliquots of 20 Ag of total
protein were electrophoresed on an 8% ( for PARP cleavage) or 10% ( for
Wnt11 western) SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4jC with 5% milk in
TBS followed by hybridization with a rabbit anti-human cleaved PARP
antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling) or with rabbit anti-human
Wnt11 antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000 (kindly provided by Len Eisenberg,
Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC; ref. 11) for
confirmation of specificity of Wnt11. The hybridization with antibodies
was done for 3 h at room temperature. After washing, the membrane was
then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:3,000. Immunoreactive bands were stained by a chemiluminescent procedure (Pierce) and
visualized by autoradiography.

Results
Identification of genomic ERA-binding sites in human
breast cancer cells. To identify the ERa-binding sites, we
developed a technique to clone sequences from DNA immunoprecipitated by an anti-ERa antibody. The ChIP-PCR procedure was
optimized to achieve amplification using an ERa antibody to detect
proteins bound to the promoter of a prototypical ERa target gene,
Myc, in the absence of any nonspecific IgG binding after 40 cycles of
PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1). Once these conditions were reproducibly achieved in five consecutive experiments, DNA fragments
immunoprecipitated by the ERa antibody were extracted, cloned,
and sequenced. A total of 130 cloned fragments with insert sizes
ranging from f100 to 1,000 bp were then identified by BLAT or
ENSEMBL searches for human genome matches.
Ninety-four cloned fragments were mapped to the genome
(Supplementary Table S1). The remaining 36 could not be mapped
because either the fragment could not be sequenced due to a high
GC-content or the cloned fragments were mapped to repetitive
sequences across the genome. Of these, as shown in Table 1, f46%
were localized within an intron of the open reading frame (ORF) of
a gene. Forty percent were located in the 5¶-region of a gene
(upstream of the transcription start site), and 14% were located in
the 3¶-region of a gene (downstream of the 3¶-untranslated region).
Further analysis showed that 23% of the ERa-ChIP fragments
were located within the 50 kb 5¶-flanking region of a gene, whereas
the remaining 17% were located >50 kb 5¶ upstream of a gene.
Approximately 12% of ERa-ChIP fragments were located within
50 kb 3¶-flanking region of a gene.
We next identified the genes that contained an ERa-binding
intron or that contained an ERa-binding site within 50 kb of its 5¶- or
3¶-flanking regions. First, we determined the mRNA expression levels
of the most proximal gene after treatment with E2 (10 9 mol/L) at 3
or 6 h. Expression levels of the second most proximal gene were also
determined after E2 treatment at similar time points, provided that
the coding region of the second gene was closer than 50 kb to the
ERa-binding site. If more than two genes were found within 50 kb,
we evaluated only the two most proximal genes. Following this
strategy, we identified 88 E2-regulated genes located proximal to the

www.aacrjournals.org

94 binding sites identified by ChIP cloning. Expression of 38 of these
88 (43%) genes was significantly regulated after 3 or 6 h of E2
treatment by z1.5-fold or V0.67-fold compared with baseline
(P < 0.05; Table 2). Importantly, 82% (31 of 38) of genes identified
were novel E2 targets, 24% of which were uncharacterized previously.
Interestingly, 54% of genes with intronic sequences that bind ERa
were regulated by E2.
Confirmation of ERA binding to E2-regulated genes.
Conventional ChIP experiments showed binding of ERa, RNA
PolII, NCOA3 (SRC-1), and IgG to 11 randomly selected putative
ERa-binding sites (each labeled by the closest gene in Fig. 1).
We showed that treatment with E2 (versus ethanol) significantly
enhanced binding of these three transcription factors to these
sites. These results further validated these sites as functional
ERa-binding sequences (Fig. 1). ERa, RNA PolII, and NCOA3
associations were observed in all 11 binding sites in an estrogendependent manner; the range of E2-dependent fold enrichments
for ChIP-derived DNA were 2.6 to 7.2 (ERa), 2.9 to 11.0 (RNA poIII),
and 2.6 to 6.5 (NCOA3) compared with the vehicle (Supplementary
Figs. S2–S4). On the other hand, there were no E2-dependent
fold enrichment of DNA fragments after ChIP with nonspecific
IgG (range of fold change, 0.9–1.1; Supplementary Fig. S5).
This independent demonstration of enrichment of these binding
sites in response to E2 suggests that the fragments identified
by ChIP cloning were bona fide ERa-binding sites in MCF-7
cells.
Genes identified by ChIP cloning are highly regulated by E2.
Using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chip, which contains probe sets
representing a majority of the human genes, we identified E2regulated genes in MCF-7 cells. We found that 3% of the probe sets
(1,618/54,613) showed differential expression (z1.5-fold or V0.67fold regulation; P < 0.05, t test) after 3 or 6 h of E2 treatment. We
compared the E2-regulated genes identified by the microarray with
the 88 genes that contained proximal ERa targets identified by
genome-wide ChIP cloning. We found that genes proximal to ERa
target sequences have a much higher chance (43%) of being
regulated by E2 compared with E2-regulated probe sets (3%)
determined by a genome-wide microarray experiment (P < 0.0001,
two sample proportion test).
Characterization of ERA target genes in breast cancer cell
lines. As described above, we confirmed that 38 of the genes

containing ERa-binding sites identified by ChIP cloning were
significantly up-regulated or down-regulated by E2 (P < 0.05). These
genes encoded novel E2 targets with various functions, such as
proliferation (Myc and SPOCK), apoptosis (Adora1), cell motility
(SPOCK), Wnt signaling (Wnt11), transcription factors or coregulators (Myc, ZBTB9, HSF1, MYOG, PLXDC1, and GRIP1), ion
transport (SLC9A1, AP1B1, and CACBN1), and signal transduction
(OR7A17, Wnt11, GPR173, STK32B, and PPM1K; Table 2). Of note,
that several genes known previously to be regulated by E2, including
Myc (12–14), CTSD (13, 15), ADORA1 (16), and GRIP1 (17), were
identified in our experiments validates the ChIP cloning technique.
We next investigated whether the expression pattern of E2regulated genes identified in MCF-7 cells was similar to that in

the T47D cell line, which is also ERa+. We determined the
mRNA levels of seven randomly selected E2-regulated ERa target
genes in T47D cells. As shown in Supplementary Table S2, the
results confirmed a very high degree of concordance between
MCF-7 and T47D cells with respect to E2 regulation of novel
ERa target genes. On the other hand, none of these seven genes
were regulated in the ERa cell line MDA-MB-231, in which
expression of two genes (MYOG and Wnt11) were undetectable
at both time points tested. Moreover, the ER antagonist ICI
182780 blocked E2-dependent regulation of these genes (data
not shown). These observations strongly support the notion that
ERa is required for E2 regulation of the target genes identified
by the ChIP cloning method.

Association between ERA target gene expression and ERA
status of breast cancer tissues. ERa status (the presence or
absence of ERa protein determined by immunohistochemistry in a
tumor sample) is a prognostic factor in breast cancer and the
single most important predictor for response to hormonal
treatment (3). To investigate whether expression of ERa target
genes identified in E2-treated MCF-7 cells are associated with the
ERa status in breast cancer tissues, the mRNA levels of three novel
ERa target genes were measured in 25 ERa+ and 20 ERa breast
cancer tissues.
We selected three prototypical E2-regulated genes, each of
which represented a distinct ERa-binding pattern: (a) 40 kb 5¶
(Wnt11), (b) intron 2 (Adora1), and (c) 2 kb 3¶ (SAPS2; Fig. 1;
Table 2). We investigated in vivo regulation of these three genes by
ERa using regression analyses. The mRNA levels of Wnt11,
Adora1, and SAPS2 were plotted against ERa mRNA levels.
Regression analysis showed statistically significant correlations
between ERa mRNA and Wnt11 mRNA (r = 0.567), ERa mRNA
and Adora1 mRNA (r = 0.609), and ERa mRNA and SAPS2 mRNA
(r = 0.792; P < 0.00005 for each r value; Fig. 2). These findings
indicate that E2-responsive genes that lie proximal to ERa-binding

sites identified by ChIP cloning in breast cancer cell lines are also
regulated by ERa in vivo.
ERA-binding sites exert regulatory activities. To determine
whether the ERa-binding sites cloned by ChIP contained sequences
with enhanced transcriptional activity, we cloned the ERa-binding
fragments proximal to the Wnt11, Adora1, and SAPS2 genes in both
the sense and the antisense orientations into an SV40 promoter/
luciferase reporter construct. As described above, the ERa-binding
site for each gene represents one of three binding patterns:
5¶ proximal for Wnt11, intronic for Adora1, and 3¶ proximal for
SAPS2. The ERa-binding site located 40 kb 5¶ of Wnt11 was not
proximal to another gene. On the other hand, the ERa-binding site
within intron 2 of Adora1 is also 13 kb 5¶ upstream of the Myogenin
gene, which is regulated by E2 in MCF-7 cells. The ERa target site
located 2 kb 3¶ downstream of the SAPS2 gene is also 1 kb 3¶
downstream of the SBF1 gene and is also regulated by E2.
Individual ERa-binding site/luciferase reporter constructs were
transfected into ERa+ MCF-7 cells, which were then treated with
vehicle or E2 for 20 h and assayed for luciferase reporter gene
activity. The ERa-binding site 40 kb 5¶ of Wnt11 enhanced transcriptional activity by 3.7-fold in the sense direction and 5.0-fold in

of ERa, Wnt11, Adora1, and SAPS2 were
measured by real-time PCR and normalized by
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
The correlation between mRNA levels of ERa and
the three ERa target genes were carried out by
regression analysis.

Figure 3. Transcriptional activities of ERa-binding
sites proximal to E2-induced genes. ERa-binding
fragments for Wnt11, Adora1, and SAPS2 were
cloned in the sense or antisense orientation into a
pGL4-SV40 plasmid. Expression of the empty vector
(Empty ) was used as a reference standard. Reporter
plasmids (0.2 Ag) and pCMVhGal (0.1 Ag) were
cotransfected into ERa+ MCF-7 cells (A) and ERa
MDA-MB-231 cells (B) in 24-well plates. After 20 to
24 h, cells were washed with PBS and treated with
10 7 mol/L E2 or ethanol for an additional 20 h. Cells
were then lysed and assayed for luciferase and
h-galactosidase activities. Columns, mean of a
representative experiment done from at least three
experiments; bars, SE. Constructs oriented in the
sense direction for the Wnt11, Adora1, and
SAPS2 genes are denoted Wnt11-S, Adora1-S,

the antisense direction on treatment with E2 (10 7 mol/L; Fig. 3A).
Similar results were obtained with transfection of luciferase reporter
constructs containing ERa-binding sites within intron 2 Adora1
and 2 kb 3¶ of SAPS2 genes. E2 treatment enhanced transcription
by 4.1-fold and 3.7-fold in cells transfected with ERa-Adora1 sense
and antisense constructs, respectively. Cells transfected with ERaSAPS2 sense construct increased transcription by 6.5-fold on
E2 treatment, whereas transcriptional activity was augmented by
16-fold on E2 treatment of cells transfected with ERa-SAPS2
antisense construct.
To show that E2 regulated the transcriptional activity of these
constructs in an ERa-dependent fashion, we transfected them into
the ERa MDA-MB-231 cell line. The absence of induction by E2
supported our conclusion that these sequences confer responsiveness to E2 in an ERa-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Overall, these
observations confirmed that ERa-binding regions identified for
Wnt11, Adora1, and SAPS2 contain E2-responsive functional
cis-acting elements.
Knockdown of E2-induced Wnt11 is associated with increased breast cancer cell death. We showed that Wnt11 is
located proximally to an ERa-binding site and its expression is
induced by E2 (Supplementary Table S2). Because Wnt11 belongs
to an oncogene family (18), we hypothesized that E2-induced
Wnt11 expression could be involved in breast cancer pathobiology.
MCF-7 cells were cultured in steroid-deprived medium for 3 days,
and siRNA against Wnt11 or control siRNA was transiently

24-h treatment with E2 or vehicle. To show the efficiency and
specificity of depletion of Wnt11, both real-time PCR and Western
blot analysis were done (Fig. 4D).
As shown in Fig. 4, knockdown of Wnt11 in MCF-7 cells treated
with or without E2 resulted in a significantly decreased cell survival
(12.2% and 13.9%, respectively) compared with cells transfected
with control siRNA (5.3% and 6.7%, respectively; P < 0.05 for each
case; Fig. 4A). We next determined whether this change in cell
survival was due to changes in apoptosis and/or proliferation.
Knockdown of Wnt11 increased apoptosis as shown specifically by
a striking increase in PARP cleavage (Fig. 4B). The highest level of
PARP cleavage was observed in Wnt11-depleted cells incubated
with vehicle followed by Wnt11-depleted cells treated with E2. The
results suggested that Wnt11 depletion increased apoptosis, and E2
blunted this effect. On the other hand, depletion of Wnt11 by
siRNA did not result in significant changes in the fractions of
MCF-7 cells in S phases compared with control samples (Fig. 4C).
However, significant changes in cell populations in S phases were
observed in an E2-dependent manner, suggesting that Wnt11 does
not have a major role in cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells. Thus,
the observed changes in cell viability seem to be due to an effect of
Wnt11 on apoptosis but not on proliferation.

Discussion
Using a ChIP-linked target site cloning strategy, we identified 94
ERa-binding sites within the human genome, many of which
represent novel E2 targets in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We showed

both in vivo and in vitro that a representative portion of these genes
are highly regulated by E2/ERa in breast cancer cells and tissues. We
also showed a novel biological role of the E2-regulated gene Wnt11 in
breast cancer.

A significant volume of work has focused on identifying essential
domains within the proximal promoters of E2-regulated genes
(6, 12, 13, 19–24). However, many functionally relevant binding sites
for transcription factor likely exist in regions outside of gene
promoters, particularly in introns (25, 26). These sites would not
have been identified using promoter microarray (21) or CpG islandenriched DNA array (20, 27), which identify binding sites only
within the region proximal to the transcription start site. A recently
published pioneering study showed by ChIP-on-chip that ERa
binds to thousands of sites genome-wide and interact with
transcription factors binding to specific cis-acting elements as a
master regulator of many genes (7).
We compared the ERa-binding sites found in this study with
those published by Carroll et al. (7). Approximately 95%, 86%, 57%,
39%, 17%, 11%, and 6% of the 94 binding sites that we cloned were
located 500, 300, 100, 50, 20, 11, and 5 kb away from the closest
binding sequences published by Carroll et al, respectively (7). The
distribution of binding sequences across the chromosomes was
fairly similar in both studies. We identified one ERa-binding site
mapped to the Y chromosome, whereas no binding sites were
mapped to this chromosome in the Carroll et al. study (7). We
showed the proximity of the 11 sites, which bind ERa, RNA PolII,
and NCOA3, from our study to the closest possible binding sites
identified in the Carroll et al. study in Supplementary Table S3. The
distance ranged from 1.24 to 304 kb. This possibly suggested that
the identification of exact binding sites may vary with the
technique used. In general, our findings agree with the conclusions
published by Carroll et al. For example, both groups found that the
majority of the ERa-binding sites fell outside of classically defined
promoter regions.
In this study, there were only 18 (of 94) binding sites that did not
reside within 50 kb of a gene. Thus, we arbitrarily chose this
distance to limit the group of genes to be tested for regulation by
estrogen treatment. It is quite possible that ERa-binding sites can
also regulate genes that lie more than 50 kb away. In fact, recently
published articles from Carroll et al. (7) showed the importance of
these far distant sites as regulators of transcription.
The fact that 54% of the genes containing intronic ERa-binding
sites were regulated by E2 suggests that this is an interesting
phenomenon with functional significance. ERa-binding fragments
located distal to genes or within introns might function through
long-range interactions that involve looping of chromatin to bring
the elements within proximity of gene promoters (26, 28). Indeed,
the intronic ERa-binding sites identified in the present study
indicate that ERa may regulate target gene transcription by
altering local chromatin structure. Recent reports about intronic
binding of other transcription factors, such as cAMP-responsive
element binding protein and BARX2, provide further support that
intronic binding of ERa may be an important mechanism of gene
regulation by E2 (25, 29).
E2 has been shown to regulate transcription through either direct
binding of EREs or indirectly by interacting with transcription
factor complexes. Analysis of the ERa-binding sequences associated
with the 38 identified E2-regulated genes revealed that 61% of these
sequences contained at least one classic (palindromic) ERE. Eightyseven percent of binding sites missing a palindromic ERE contained
one or more AP-1 sites. The comparison of these results with
previously published data suggests that there is a higher likelihood
of the occurrence of canonical EREs in ERa-binding sites proximal
to an E2-regulated gene (4, 6). Furthermore, in the absence of an
ERE, AP-1 or other cis-acting elements may confer E2/ERa

responsiveness possibly via tethering of ERa on AP-1–binding
transcription factors (19).
It has been shown that Wnt11 signaling induces proliferation
(30), transformation (31), and prostate cancer progression (32)
through a noncanonical pathway (33–35). However, the role of
Wnt11 in the progression of breast cancer remains unknown. Our
studies provide an initial insight into the mechanism by which
Wnt11 may promote tumor progression in the breast. Upregulation of Wnt11 mRNA on E2 exposure may activate the
Wnt11 signaling pathway and inhibit apoptosis, thus favoring
