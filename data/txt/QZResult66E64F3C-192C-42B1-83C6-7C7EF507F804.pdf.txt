Targeted Inhibition of Replication Protein A Reveals Cytotoxic
Activity, Synergy with Chemotherapeutic DNA-Damaging
Agents, and Insight into Cellular Function
Sarah C. Shuck2 and John J. Turchi1,2

Abstract
Targeting uncontrolled cell proliferation and resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics with a single
agent has significant potential in cancer treatment. Replication protein A (RPA), the eukaryotic ssDNA-binding
protein, is essential for genomic maintenance and stability via roles in both DNA replication and repair. We
have identified a novel small molecule that inhibits the in vitro and cellular ssDNA-binding activity of RPA,
prevents cell cycle progression, induces cytotoxicity, and increases the efficacy of chemotherapeutic DNAdamaging agents. These results provide new insight into the mechanism of RPA-ssDNA interactions in chromosome maintenance and stability. This represents the first molecularly targeted eukaryotic DNA-binding
inhibitor and reveals the utility of targeting a protein-DNA interaction as a therapeutic strategy for cancer
treatment. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3189–98. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Replication protein A (RPA) is a heterotrimeric ssDNAbinding protein made up of 70-, 34-, and 14-kDa subunits
(1). The ssDNA-binding activity of RPA is required for several DNA metabolic pathways, including DNA replication, recombination, and repair. High-affinity interactions with DNA
are sustained by the numerous oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding (OB) folds present on each of the three subunits
(2, 3). OB folds in DNA-binding domains A and B (DBD-A
and DBD-B) in the central region of the p70 subunit contribute most of the binding energy for RPA-ssDNA interactions
(2). Individual OB folds are compact modular domains populated with hydrophobic and basic amino acids. These structural features make the OB fold an attractive target for
development of small-molecule inhibitors (SMI) of DNAbinding activity.
Inhibiting RPA-DNA interactions has the potential to
affect numerous DNA metabolic pathways that are differentially activated in cancer cells. In DNA replication, RPA inhibition can be used to exploit the highly proliferative nature of
cancer cells, which is characterized by a large population of
cells in S phase. Consistent with this, a recent clinical trial

increased RPA p70 and p34 expression (4). RPA is also essential for several DNA repair pathways in the cell, including
nucleotide excision repair (NER). Cisplatin, a common chemotherapeutic used in the treatment of various cancers, induces its cytotoxic effect by forming intrastrand covalent
DNA adducts that are repaired primarily by the NER pathway
(5). Consistent with the role of NER in the repair of cisplatininduced DNA damage, resistance to this treatment has been
observed to be influenced by DNA repair capacity (6, 7). Consequently, cisplatin treatment, in conjunction with decreased
RPA ssDNA-binding activity, would be expected to result in
decreased efficiency of cellular repair of cisplatin-DNA adducts and increased cytotoxicity. Thus, targeting RPA has
the potential not only for single-agent activity but also to
sensitize cancer cells to therapies that induce DNA damage
and genetic instability, such as cisplatin, etoposide, and ionizing radiation.
We present the identification and development of the first
small molecule that inhibits the ssDNA-binding activity of
RPA. Cellular RPA inhibition results in the inability to enter
S phase, cytotoxicity, and synergistic activity with the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin and etoposide. This is the first
characterization of a small molecule that is able to inhibit
the ssDNA-binding activity of RPA and presents a novel chemotherapeutic target both as a single agent and in conjunction with commonly used chemotherapeutics.

Materials and Methods
In vitro protein analysis. SMIs were obtained from
ChemDiv and resuspended in DMSO. Compound 505 was independently synthesized and structure was confirmed by
mass spectrometry analysis. Human RPA was purified as previously described (8). Fluorescence anisotropy–based DNAbinding assays were performed with 40 nmol/L RPA and

20 nmol/L 5′-fluorescein–labeled ss-dT12 DNA as previously
described (9). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)
were performed in 20 μL reactions containing 25 nmol/L
RPA and 25 nmol/L 5′-32P-labeled 34-bp DNA as previously
described (8).
Molecular modeling. Molecular modeling of compound
505 with the central DBD of RPA p70 (1FGU) was performed
using AutoDock 4.2 (10). Three independent grids established
60 Å in each dimension to encompass either the interdomain
region, DBD-A, or DBD-B. Semiflexible automated ligand
docking was performed using the Monte Carlo–based simulated annealing and locality search algorithms. The most stable complexes were selected based on binding energies from
multiple analyses. Coordinates of the final docked complexes
were displayed with PyMOL.
Flow cytometry. H460 cells were analyzed for apoptosis using an Annexin V–FITC/propidium iodide (PI) Vybrant Apoptosis Assay kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104/cm2 for
24 h and then treated with compound 505 for 48 h. Following
plating and treatment of H460 cells, adherent and nonadherent cells were collected, processed, and analyzed on a BD
FACScan flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using WinMDI
software (The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA). Cell
cycle analysis was performed by PI staining. Briefly, cells were
plated and treated with compound, collected, and then
washed twice with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBSEDTA. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at −20°C followed by
incubation on ice for 30 min. Cells were then collected and
stained with 1 μg/mL PI and 25 μg/mL RNaseA for 1.5 h
and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Cells were gated and analyzed on a histogram with
events plotted against the FL2-A parameter. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using ModFit software. G2 arrest was induced by treatment with 0.8 μg/mL nocodazole for 12 h (11).
Cells were then washed with PBS and treated with either vehicle or compound 505 (100 μmol/L). Cells were harvested
and analyzed for cell cycle distribution as described above.
To analyze bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, cells
were labeled with 10 μmol/L BrdUrd, after which cells were
collected, washed, and fixed in 70% ethanol. Following fixation, DNA was denatured with 2 mol/L HCl for 20 min at
room temperature, washed, and neutralized with 0.5 mol/L
sodium borate for 2 min. Cells were then incubated with
anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:500; Calbiochem) for 20 min at room
temperature, washed, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor
488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500; Invitrogen)
also for 20 min at room temperature. Following antibody
incubation, cells were washed and incubated in 1 μg/mL PI
in PBS-EDTA for at least 30 min at 4°C. Cells were then analyzed as described above for cell cycle and BrdUrd staining
using FLA and FL1 parameters, respectively.
Indirect immunofluorescence. H460 cells were plated on
chamber slides (LabTek) as described above. Cells were then
treated for 3 h with either 50 μmol/L compound 505 or vehicle as indicated, and following treatment, cells were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde at 25°C for 3 min followed by washing in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min at 4°C. The slides were

then blocked in 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS for 1 h
at 25°C and then incubated with anti-RPA p34 primary antibody (1:500; NeoMarkers) in 15% FBS for 1 h. Slides were
then washed thrice for 10 min with 15% FBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300; Invitrogen) for 1 h. Slides were again washed
and stained with 300 nmol/L 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) diluted in PBS-EDTA for 5 min. Slides were then
mounted and images were captured using a Zeiss fluorescent
microscope. Images were captured using filters for Texas red
to visualize RPA staining and DAPI for visualizing DNA.
Slides were visualized and images were analyzed and quantified using ImageJ software.
Western blot analysis. H460 cells were plated and treated
with either vehicle or increasing concentrations of compound 505 as indicated for 8 h and then processed for Western blot analysis using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay
lysis and extraction procedure. Protein concentrations were
determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with BSA standard and equal amounts of total protein were loaded in each
well. Following electrophoresis and transfer to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes, RPA was detected with an anti-RPA
p34 (1:2,000) or anti-p70 antibody (1:1,000; NeoMarkers)
and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary
(1:5,000 and 1:2,500, respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Bands were visualized using chemiluminescence detection.

Results
Identification of a SMI of RPA. Previous work from our
laboratory has identified a series of small molecules from
the National Cancer Institute library (9) and a ChemDiv
library (12) that inhibit the DNA-binding activity of RPA. Hits
obtained from the ChemDiv library were analyzed in a
secondary assay using EMSAs to confirm inhibitory activity
(Fig. 1A). Of those analyzed, two showed significant RPA
inhibition in vitro (compounds 3 and 5). As in vivo inhibition
of RPA using small interfering RNA (siRNA) is cytotoxic due
to its critical role in DNA metabolic processes, we analyzed
the effect of these two compounds on cellular viability (13).
Although minimal cellular effects were observed with compounds 3 and 5, the analyses were somewhat hampered by
poor solubility (data not shown). However, considering the
in vitro activity of compound 3, we retained its core structure
consisting of a substituted dihydropyrazole with a 4-oxobutanoic acid at N1 and a phenyl substituent at C3 to initiate analysis of structure-activity relationships (SAR) and
identify compounds with improved cellular activity (Fig.
1C). Eighty-one analogues were identified and obtained from
the ChemDiv library with differing substitutions off the phenyl ring (R2) and varying substituents at position C5 on the
dihydropyrazole ring (R1) (Fig. 1C). These derivatives were
analyzed for in vitro RPA-inhibitory activity using EMSAs
(Fig. 1D; data not shown). A subset of these compounds that
showed the ability to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of RPA
was further characterized to determine how the structure of
each contributes to this inhibition. Using EMSA analysis, titrations of each compound were performed and the IC50 of

each was determined. Among the compounds analyzed,
compound 505 was the most potent inhibitor with an IC50
of 13 μmol/L, whereas other compounds displayed varying
capacities for RPA inhibition (Table 1; Fig. 2). To determine
cellular activity of each of the compounds, cell viability was
measured with Annexin V/PI analysis in the H460 non–small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line and IC50 values for
each compound following a 48-hour exposure were determined. These data are presented in Table 1 and reveal a correlation between in vitro and cellular activity, consistent with
cellular inhibition of RPA and indicating specificity for RPA
inhibition. Interestingly, compound 523, which showed minimal inhibition of RPA in vitro, did display modest cellular
activity, which could be attributed to metabolism or other
cellular effects. As compound 505 displayed the lowest
in vitro IC50 and was the most potent compound of those
examined in cells, we selected this compound to further investigate its in vitro and cellular mechanisms of action.

pound 505 with RPA, binding to oligonucleotides varying in
length and sequence was examined. Compound 505 was first
titrated with a constant amount of RPA in the presence of
5′-32P-labeled 34-bp purine-rich ssDNA. This length of DNA
is capable of extending beyond the central OB folds of the
RPA p70 subunit to allow interactions with other OB folds
within the RPA heterotrimer. This analysis revealed a concentration-dependent decrease in binding with an IC50 of
13 μmol/L (Fig. 2A). We then extended the analysis to a
ssDNA 12 bases in length, which largely restricts binding to
DBD-A and DBD-B, which has been shown in the cocrystal
structure of RPA p70 (14). A fluorescence polarization assay
was used to accommodate the dT12 substrate, and titration
of compound 505 resulted in reduced RPA binding with an
IC50 value of 20.4 μmol/L (Fig. 2C). These data provide evidence for inhibition of RPA by blocking the interaction of
these OB folds with DNA. In our initial screen of the ChemDiv library for RPA inhibitors, we counterscreened each compound against xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein
(XPA), an essential DNA-binding protein in the NER pathway,
and excluded any compound that inhibited both targets (12).
To confirm this specificity for RPA, we examined the effect of
505 on XPA binding in an ELISA format, and no inhibitory
activity was observed (data not shown).

505. A, increasing concentrations of compound
505 were preincubated with RPA and DNA-binding
activity was assessed using EMSA analysis.

a standard four-parameter logistic curve (n = 4).
C, fluorescence anisotropy was performed with
increasing concentrations of compound 505 with

Materials and Methods. The data were analyzed as
described in B (n = 3). D, surface representation of
RPA p70 181–422 (1FGU) with compound 505
docked in DBD-A (blue), DBD-B (green), and the
interdomain (ID) region (red). Close-up views of
each interaction are presented in the outsets, with
compound 505 depicted using stick representations
with Corey-Pauling-Koltun coloring.

To further define the interaction between compound 505
and DBD-A and DBD-B, we undertook a molecular modeling
approach. The crystal structure of RPA p70 181–422 was
solved without DNA (18), and three-dimensional coordinates
were obtained from the protein data bank (1FGU). Compound 505 was prepared as the ligand using AutoDock tools
1.5.2 as described in Materials and Methods. Three potential
binding sites were identified based on the lowest interaction
energies. These sites include each of the OB folds and the
interdomain region between the two folds (Fig. 2D). The
most stable interaction was with DBD-B, whereas DBD-A domain ranked second in binding energy, and the interdomain
region showed the least stable interaction. The close-up of
the interaction presented in the insets reveals that most of
the stability is driven via hydrophobic interactions, although
the conserved oxobutyric acid is stabilized via interactions
with basic amino acids in each of the three positions. To determine the relative importance of the interaction of compound 505 with each domain, docking analysis of
compound 518 was performed, which shows no inhibition
of the DNA-binding activity of RPA in vitro. Significantly in-

creased ΔG values were obtained for interactions of 518 with
DBD-B and the interdomain region, whereas only modest increases were calculated for the interaction with DBD-A.
These data suggest that the majority of the inhibitory effect
of compound 505 is manifested through interaction with the
DBD-B OB fold and potentially the interdomain region.
Compound 505 decreases cell viability and nuclear RPA
staining without induction of apoptosis and degradation
of RPA. Having determined the in vitro activity of compound
505, we sought to determine the mechanism of cellular activity and the ramifications of inhibiting the central p70 OB
folds of RPA. To measure the induction of apoptosis, H460
NSCLC cells were treated with increasing concentrations of
compound 505 for 48 hours, after which Annexin V/PI staining was measured using flow cytometry (Fig. 3). Minimal
Annexin V staining was observed, suggesting that classic apop
tosis was not initiated (19). Interestingly, a concentrationdependent increase in PI staining was observed, indicating
a general loss of membrane integrity, suggestive of necrotic
cell death (Fig. 3A; ref. 20). Quantification of the viable cells
(Annexin V−/PI−) resulted in an IC50 of 30.8 μmol/L (Fig. 3B).

Magnification of the boxed cells is presented below the low-magnification images. D, H460 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of

vehicle-treated control; lanes 2 to 5, treatment with 25, 50, 75, and 100 μmol/L TDRL-505, respectively. Arrows, positions of RPA p34 and p70.

As an independent measure of the effect of compound 505
on cell viability, we used a crystal violet staining assay and
obtained an IC50 of 64 μmol/L (data not shown). A similar
result was also observed in treatment of the A549 NSCLC cell
line with compound 505, whereas analysis using freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed minimal
cytotoxic activity (data not shown). Therefore, compound
505 has shown significant cytotoxic effects in NSCLC cell
lines while showing only modest activity in noncancerous
cells, supporting the possibility that a therapeutic treatment
window may be achievable.
The cellular effects seen following treatment with compound 505 are consistent with an inability of RPA to interact
with DNA, which could then result in numerous possibilities,
including degradation or redistribution of RPA within the cell.
We therefore used indirect immunofluorescence to assess
how inhibition of RPA binding influences cellular localization.
After 3 hours of treatment with compound, cells showed a de-

3194

Cancer Res; 70(8) April 15, 2010

crease in the intensity of RPA staining compared with vehicletreated control without a change in overall subcellular localization (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, Western blot analysis revealed
that both RPA p70 and p34 levels remain constant following
treatment with increasing concentrations of compound 505
(Fig. 3D). These results show that treatment with compound
505 decreases the association of RPA with DNA, whereas the
overall level of RPA is not dramatically affected.
Compound 505 affects cell cycle progression and DNA
replication. The ability of compound 505 to reduce RPA
nuclear staining and cell viability led us to assess the effect
of treatment on cell cycle progression. siRNA knockdown of
RPA has been shown to induce a G1 cell cycle arrest, consistent with the essential role of RPA in the initiation of S-phase
DNA replication (21). Therefore, we assessed the effect of
compound 505 treatment on H460 cell cycle progression,
and an increase in the proportion of cells in G1 phase was
observed in response to treatment (Fig. 4A). To determine

if entry into S phase is inhibited in compound 505–treated
cells, cells were synchronized in G2-M with nocodazole and
then released from G2 arrest and refed complete medium
supplemented with either vehicle or compound 505. Both
control and treated cells rapidly progressed through mitosis
into G1 after removal of nocodazole (Fig. 4B). Cells that were
treated with vehicle alone entered into G1, as seen at the
4-hour time point, and progression into S phase is apparent
after 8 hours, with progression into G2 evident at 12 hours
(Fig. 4B). Cells that were treated with compound 505 after
release from nocodazole progressed into G1 but did not enter
S phase after 12 hours after release. To increase the resolution of the biochemical steps in the transition from G1 to S
phase, we assessed BrdUrd incorporation using the same
treatment protocol. Following release of nocodazole-arrested
cells, 10 μmol/L BrdUrd was added 2 hours before collection,
and cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry for BrdUrd
incorporation. In the presence of compound 505, no BrdUrd
incorporation was observed, whereas vehicle controls
showed incorporation and progression through the cell cycle
(Fig. 4B). To determine the acute effect of compound 505 on
DNA replication, asynchronous cells were treated with compound 505 for a short period of time (3 hours), and small but
distinct differences in BrdUrd incorporation were observed
(Fig. 4C). Cells treated with TDRL-505 seem to display a
lengthening of S phase and fewer cells that have incorporated
BrdUrd progressing through the cell cycle into G2 (Fig. 4C).
The effect of RPA inhibition on DNA repair and the
response to DNA damage. In addition to its essential role
in DNA replication, RPA is involved in the DNA damage response and is required for the repair of bulky DNA adducts
as well as DNA breaks induced by various types of exogenous
and endogenous agents. The association of RPA with ssDNA
is a critical feature of all of these pathways, indicating that
inhibition of this activity would increase the cytotoxic effects
induced by DNA damage. To determine the effect of RPA
inhibition on cellular sensitivity to cisplatin, we evaluated
the combination index (CI) using a concurrent treatment
protocol (22). When cisplatin and compound 505 were used
in combination, cell viability was decreased to a level that
was greater than that induced by either agent alone, resulting
in synergy between the two compounds and CI of 0.4 at the
highest fraction of cells affected (Fig. 5). The interaction
became additive and then antagonistic (revealed from CI
values of >1) at lower fractions of cells affected (Fig. 5). These
results show that compound 505 is able to potentiate the
effect of cisplatin in H460 cells and is consistent with inhibition of the cellular activity of RPA in NER. The ability of compound 505 to synergize with etoposide was also examined.
Etoposide induces replication fork arrest and DNA damage
response, both cellular processes that require RPA (23). Using
the same analysis as described above for cisplatin, compound
505 showed synergistic activity with etoposide at all fractions
of cells affected (Fig. 5). Interestingly, when the formation of
etoposide-induced RPA foci (23) or phosphorylation of DNAPKcs at Ser2056 was measured (24), the cotreatment with
TDRL-505 resulted in a slight increase in the number of cells
with foci and DNA-PKcs phosphorylation (Supplementary

the cellular response to etoposide, consistent with the synergy
observed between the two agents in the CI analyses (Fig. 5).

Discussion
Advances in high-throughput screening of chemical libraries have resulted in an explosion of putative cancer targets
and their inhibitors. To date, the majority of these target
enzymatic activity associated with a specific protein. Our
results targeting the nonenzymatic DNA-binding activity of
RPA open up an entire new class of putative interactions
for therapeutic development. One such compound, 505, inhibits RPA-DNA interactions in vitro, blocks cell entry into
S phase, and results in a cytotoxic/cytostatic response. Each
of these responses is consistent with inhibiting the role of
RPA in the initiation of DNA replication, which involves a
complex series of interactions, one of which is the loading
of RPA at replication origins in an S-phase cyclin-dependent
kinase–dependent process (21, 25). Data presented show that
TDRL-505 also abrogates BrdUrd incorporation into DNA
in cells released from G2 arrest without an overall decrease
in asynchronous cells, consistent with the importance of RPA
in replication fork firing in the initial stages of DNA replication. Interestingly, treatment of asynchronous cells with
TDRL-505 did display a prolongation of S phase evidenced
by fewer cells completing S phase and progressing into G2
in the pulse-labeling experiments. Therefore, replication
forks that are established before the addition of TDRL-505
seem not to be disrupted; however, the initiation from additional late-firing replication origins is decreased in the presence of TDRL-505. The potential exists that cells that have
already began replicating their DNA are not affected by
the inhibition of RPA binding to DNA, which correlates with
observations that TDRL-505 is unable to compete RPA away

Therefore, cells dependent on entry into S phase for continuous cell proliferation would be expected to be negatively
affected by treatment with TDRL-505. The inability of cells
to enter S phase is a potential mechanism contributing to
cytotoxicity. This allows for the possibility of a therapeutic
window for specifically targeting actively dividing cells in
the context of cancer treatment using SMIs to block the
cellular activity of RPA. This rationale is further bolstered
by the clinical observation that high levels of RPA expression correlate with disease stage in colon cancers (4).
The role of RPA in DNA repair also allows for inhibition of
its activity to increase the efficacy of current chemotherapeutics that induce DNA damage in the context of combination
therapy. The inhibition of DNA repair is anticipated to result
in persistent DNA damage, which would increase cytotoxicity.
The indispensable role of RPA in the recognition and verification steps of NER is well characterized, and in addition, RPA
participates in the resynthesis step following excision of the
damaged oligonucleotide (26). Previous studies have shown
that cells with decreased levels of NER proteins show increased sensitivity to cisplatin treatment (6). Consistent with
this, our data reveal a synergistic interaction between compound 505 and cisplatin at high fractions of cells affected. Interestingly, at low fractions of cells affected, an antagonistic
interaction is observed with CIs >1. This is likely the result of
interactions not at the level of repair but at the level of signaling. As cisplatin leads to activation of a G2 checkpoint and
induces apoptosis from an extended G2 arrest, the finding
that compound 505 blocks cells in G1 indicates that fewer
cells would be subjected to cisplatin-induced G2 arrest. Likewise, if compound 505 toxicity stems from an extended G1
arrest, the G2 checkpoint induced by cisplatin would result
in less cell death as a result of treatment. At high concentrations, this effect is mitigated by the interaction at the level of
DNA repair, with RPA inhibition increasing cisplatin toxicity
and overcoming the antagonistic signaling interaction.
The role of RPA in DNA replication restart and processing
of collapsed replication forks also presents opportunities for
combination therapy (27, 28). Interestingly, CI analysis of the
activity of etoposide with compound 505 showed synergistic
activity at all fractions of cells affected. Etoposide inhibits the
enzymatic activity of topoisomerase II (topo II), resulting in
persistent covalent-cleavage complexes on DNA, which lead
to replication fork arrest and both single- and double-strand
breaks (29). RPA has been shown to respond to and repair
these types of lesions, and reduction of the levels of RPA
p70 using siRNA results in increased formation of DNA
double-strand breaks in response to etoposide treatment
(23). These data are consistent with our observation that inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of RPA potentiates the
effects seen by inhibiting topo II. Additional data show that
the formation of etoposide-induced RPA foci measured at 4
hours of treatment was not inhibited by concurrent treatment with TDRL-505, although increased cytotoxicity was
observed. Clearly, it will be of interest to assess foci dynamics
as a function of the timing of RPA inhibition with respect to
the induction of DNA damage. In addition, in asynchronous

www.aacrjournals.org

cultures, at any given time, a cell undergoing replication
would be expected to be in various stages of origin firing.
RPA is required in early replication firing, whereas topo II
is required for later-stage replication events (30). Therefore,
inhibition of both stages of replication progression would be
expected to show a greater effect than inhibiting either one
of the steps individually, which is consistent with the synergistic relationship between compound 505 and etoposide. Inhibition of RPA activity and abrogation of pathway function
has the potential for widespread utility in cancer treatment.
Although we focused on a subset of pathways, the role of
RPA in several other repair pathways opens up other opportunities for combination therapy. Specifically, combining molecularly targeted RPA inhibition with radiation therapy
could lead to increased cytotoxicity in tumor cells via inhibition of DNA double-strand break repair via nonhomologous
DNA end joining or homologous recombination, both of
which have been shown to require RPA (31–33).
As in the case of any novel SMI, specificity for the proposed
target is a concern. We have shown specificity of TDRL-505
for RPA in in vitro analysis and have shown a correlation between the in vitro IC50 and cellular IC50 for all compounds
analyzed except one. TDRL-523 did show robust cellular activity with modest in vitro RPA inhibition. The potential exists
that TDRL-523 undergoes extracellular and/or intracellular
modification that results in a higher affinity for RPA in a cellular model compared with in vitro conditions. It is also possible that TDRL-523 does not show a high specificity for RPA
and is interacting with other proteins that contain structurally similar OB fold regions, such as telomere end protection
proteins (34). Although OB folds adopt a similar global structure, the lack of sequence similarity between these domains
suggests that specific interactions between amino acids and
nucleic acids allow for differential interactions with nucleic
acids (35). We are currently elucidating the interaction between TDRL-505 and specific amino acids in DBD-A and
DBD-B of RPA p70 to determine if TDRL-505 can potentially
interact with other OB fold–containingproteins. It is also likely that compounds specific for a given OB fold within RPA
will have different effects on DNA metabolism dependent
on the role each OB fold plays in a given pathway.
Although targeting the enzymatic activity of proteins with
small molecules is well accepted, the research presented in
this article shows the feasibility and utility of targeting a nonenzymatic protein-DNA interaction. These compounds therefore represent the first SMIs of RPA that display both in vitro
and cellular activity. The approach of targeting RPA for cancer chemotherapy has several unique advantages, including
the lack of redundancy resulting from no backup systems
to counteract a loss of RPA activity. In addition, inhibition
of RPA is expected to have broad-spectrum utility, as the reliance on RPA for increased cell proliferation and repair of
chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agents is not unique to
any single cancer. Our targeting of the DNA-binding activity
of RPA with a small drug-like molecule sets the precedent for
targeting this class of proteins and thus alters the current
drug discovery paradigm to open up an entire new class of
targets with potential broad-spectrum utility.
