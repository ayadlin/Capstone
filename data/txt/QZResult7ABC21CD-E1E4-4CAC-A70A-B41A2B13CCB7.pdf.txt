ABSTRACT
B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients harboring p53 mutations
are invariably refractory to therapies based on purine analogues and have limited
treatment options and poor survival. Having recently demonstrated that the
mitochondria-targeting small molecule sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) exhibits antileukemic activity in p53wild-type B-CLL cells, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
effect of DCA in p53mutated B-CLL cells and in p53mutated/null leukemic cell lines. DCA
exhibited comparable cytotoxicity in p53wild-type and p53mutated B-CLL patient cell cultures,
as well as in p53mutated B leukemic cell lines (MAVER, MEC-1, MEC-2). At the molecular
level, DCA promoted the transcriptional induction of p21 in all leukemic cell types
investigated, including p53null HL-60. By using a proteomic approach, we demonstrated
that DCA up-regulated the ILF3 transcription factor, which is a known regulator of
p21 expression. The role of the ILF3/p21 axis in mediating the DCA anti-leukemic
activity was underscored by knocking-down experiments. Indeed, transfection with
ILF3 and p21 siRNAs significantly decreased both the DCA-induced p21 expression and
the DCA-mediated cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results emphasize that DCA is a
small molecule that merits further evaluation as a therapeutic agent also for p53mutated
leukemic cells, by acting through the induction of a p53-independent pathway.

INTRODUCTION

increasing interest for the therapeutic potentiality of the
mitochondria-targeting dichloroacetate (DCA) against
malignant cells. Indeed, preclinical studies confirm the
relatively low toxicity of DCA and document its efficacy
against numerous epithelial cancers (such as non-small
cell lung, endometrial, prostate, breast and colorectal
cancer), glioblastoma, as well as multiple myeloma
[5-14]. Recently, we have demonstrated that DCA is
cytotoxic also in p53wild-type primary B-CLL patient cells
and in p53wild-type B leukemic cell lines [15], when used in
the same range of concentrations previously employed in
in vitro studies performed in solid tumors and multiple
myeloma cells [10-12,14]. Moreover, we found that in

Emerging data indicate that cancer associated
oxidative stress, resulting from the accumulation of
reactive oxygen species and leading to genetic instability
and drug resistance [1,2], might be involved in the
pathogenesis of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)
[3]. A recent study has demonstrated the prevalence
of oxidative stress in B-CLL patients, adaptation to
permanent intrinsic oxidative stress and mitochondrial
biogenesis [4]. Thus, the mitochondria might be primary
targets of cancer therapeutics instead of simple bystanders
during cancer development. In this context, there is an

RESULTS

p53wild-type B leukemic cells DCA activates p53 and potently
synergizes with Nutlin-3, a non-genotoxic activator of the
p53 pathway [15].
Although these findings were promising, a major
unresolved clinical problem of B-CLL is represented
by the lack of effective treatments for B-CLL patients
harboring TP53 mutations [16]. In this respect, although
TP53 mutations in naïve B-CLL were usually considered
a rare (<5%) event [16-17], a recent study performed using
the next generation sequencing technology demonstrated
that very small TP53 mutated subclones are present in
9% (28/309) of newly diagnosed B-CLL patients [18], a
percentage significantly higher than previously reported
by the Sanger technology. Of note, patients harboring
small TP53 mutated subclones showed the same clinical
phenotype and poor survival as patients carrying clonal
TP53 lesions [18]. In addition, the percentage of TP53
mutations dramatically increases up to >30% after
relapsed chemotherapy [19].
On these bases, the aim of the present study was
to evaluate the potential therapeutic activity of DCA
in p53mutated B leukemic cells. For this purpose, DCA
cytotoxicity was evaluated on primary p53mutated B-CLL
patient cells in comparison with p53wild-type B-CLL patient
cells as well as on a panel of p53mutated B leukemic cell
lines (MAVER, MEC-1, MEC-2). Finally, in order to
dissect the p53-independent molecular mechanisms of
DCA cytotoxicity, a set of experiments was performed
using the p53null HL-60 leukemic cell line.

DCA promotes comparable cytotoxicity in p53wildtype
and p53mutated B-CLL patient cells
Since B-CLL patients characterized by p53
dysfunction have limited treatment options and poor
overall survival [16,18,19], in the first set of experiments
we comparatively evaluated the in vitro effect of DCA
assessed on B-CLL patient cells characterized by either
p53 wild-type or harboring TP53 mutations (Table 1). For
this purpose, upon validation of a TP53 next generation
sequencing screening (performed on a total of 80 B-CLL
patients), we selected 5 patients with p53 wild-type
and 5 patients characterized by mutations potentially
affecting p53 functionality, as predicted by web mutation
pathogenicity prediction tools and protein structural
bioinformatic analysis (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure
1). B-CLL cell cultures were exposed in vitro to DCA in
a range of concentrations (1-30 mM) previously used by
other authors in in vitro solid tumor models [10-12,14],
and in our recent study performed in primary p53wildtype
B-CLL cells [15]. As documented by the IC50 (50%
inhibition concentration) values, in vitro treatment with
DCA induced a significant and progressive reduction
of cell viability, with respect to the untreated cultures
assessed at the same time points (24 and 48 hours), in all
the primary B-CLL patient cell cultures, irrespectively of
the p53 status (Table 2).
Although we have previously shown that DCA

viability at both 24 and 48 hours of treatment. Dose response curves were derived by calculating the cell viability as percentage with respect
to the untreated cultures (set to 100%). Data are means±SD of at least three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate (MannWhitney rank-sum test; asterisks, p<0.05).

DCA induces the transcription of p21 in both
p53wild-type and p53mutated/null leukemic cells

activates the p53 pathway in p53wild-type B leukemic cells
[15], the current set of data suggested that DCA can
promote cytotoxicity also independently of functional p53.
Thus, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlining
DCA cytotoxicity in leukemic cells with dysfunctional
p53, we selected three p53mutated B leukemic cell lines
(MAVER, MEC-1, MEC-2), which exhibited a doseand time-dependent cytotoxic response to DCA (Figure
1A) with IC50 values comparable to those assessed for
primary p53wild-type and p53mutated B-CLL cells (Table 2). The
ability of DCA to promote p53-independent cytotoxicity
in leukemic cells was further supported by experiments
performed on the p53null HL-60 cell line (Figure 1B). The
cytotoxicity induced by DCA in p53mutated/null leukemic
cell lines was the result of (i) a cytostatic effect with the
accumulation in G1 phase of the cell cycle (Figure 2A),
(ii) the promotion of cellular senescence (Figure 2B),
(iii) the induction of mitochondrial damage (Figure 2C),
coupled to (iv) apoptosis (Figure 2D).

In the next set of experiments, we have investigated
the mRNA levels of p21, whose in vitro induction
represents a positive prognostic marker of response to
therapy [20]. Surprisingly, DCA was equally effective in
increasing the transcription levels of p21 in both primary
p53wild-type and p53mutated B-CLL leukemic cells (Figure 3A).
The induction of p21 was confirmed at the protein level
by Western blot analysis. Moreover, DCA significantly
increased the steady-state mRNA levels in all the p53mutated
B cell lines (MAVER, MEC-1 and MEC-2) as well as in
p53null HL-60 (Figure 3A), thus confirming the ability
of DCA to induce p21 expression independently of the
presence of p53. In parallel, a confirmation of the lack
of functional p53 transcriptional activity in both p53mutated
primary B-CLL cells and p53mutated MAVER, MEC-1 and
MEC-2 cell lines as well as in p53null HL-60 was provided

Figure 3: Induction of p21 by DCA in p53mutated/null leukemic cells. Levels of p21 were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in the

p53wilde-type and p53mutated B-CLL patient samples, as well as in the p53mutated B leukemic cell lines (MAVER, MEC-1 and MEC-2) and in the
p53null HL-60 cells. In A, levels of p21 modulation upon 24 hours of treatment with DCA (30 mM) are shown. Representative western blot
results documenting induction of p21 protein by DCA in 2 B-CLL patient samples are shown in the insets. In B, the same cell cultures were
exposed for 24 hours to Nutlin-3 (10 µM) before measurement of p21 levels. In parallel, as a positive control, p21 induction by Nutlin-3 was
assessed in a p53wild-type B-CLL sample. In A and B, mRNA levels are expressed as fold of modulation with respect to the control untreated
cultures set at 1. Results are reported as means±SD of at least three independent experiments, performed in duplicate, carried out on each

by the use of Nutlin-3, a small molecule activator of p53
[21]. Indeed, while Nutlin-3 (10 µM) potently induced
p21 transcription in primary p53wild-type B-CLL cells, it
did not promote any modulation of p21 mRNA over the
baseline in both primary p53mutated B-CLL patient samples
and p53mutated/null leukemic cell lines (Figure 3B), thus
confirming the p53-independent activation of p21 by DCA
in these cell models.

expression. As shown in Figure 4D, the knock-down
of ILF3 expression by siRNA transfection determined
the concomitant reduction in p21 mRNA levels both in
untreated culture and upon DCA exposure, consistently
with the documented role of ILF3 as a regulator of p21 at
transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels [23,24] as
summarized in Supplementary Figure 2. The involvement
of ILF3 in DCA anti-leukemic signaling pathway, in
absence of functional p53 pathway, was revealed by
the effect of its down-modulation in attenuating DCA
cytotoxicity, similarly to the effect resulted by p21 gene
silencing (Figure 4D-E). On the other hand, knock-down
of ILF3 expression in p53wilde-type cells did not determine
significant modulatory effects on p21 (both in untreated
culture and upon DCA exposure; Supplementary Figure
3). Although this is not a direct evidence of the role of p53
in p21 regulation, nevertheless it suggests a prominent role
of p53-pathway in the p21 induction by DCA in p53wild-type
cells.

Role of ILF3-p21 axis in DCA induced cytotoxicity
To gain insight into the p53-independent induction
of p21 by DCA, we adopted a proteomic approach using
the HL-60 p53null leukemic model in order to rule out
any potential interference by mutated p53 protein. For
this purpose, we used a 1-DE gel approach for protein
pre-fractionation integrated into a typical LC-MS/
MS workflow for protein identification, performed as
previously described [22]. A label-free approach (spectral
counting) was then used for relative protein abundance
quantification. Overall, our proteomic analysis identified
727 proteins in the total lysate of untreated and DCA
treated HL-60 cells. According to statistical tests, HL60 exposed to DCA for 24 hours exhibited a significant
difference (at least 3-fold) in the abundance of 17
proteins compared to the untreated counterpart, with
10 up-regulated proteins and 7 down-regulated proteins
(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Network analysis, using
MetaCore bioinformatic tools of the 17 significantly
deregulated proteins, revealed the involvement of Cellular
metabolic processes as the main GO processes altered by
DCA treatment (Figure 4A). In addition, when MetaCore
software was used to map the shortest paths of interactions
among the differentially expressed proteins, 12 out of
17 proteins were brought together with p21 as the hub
of the identified network (Figure 4B). Interestingly p21
was directly connected with interleukin enhancer-binding
factor 3 (ILF3, also known as NFAT-90).
On the base of the proteomic results, we next
tested the potential role of p21 in mediating the antileukemic activity of DCA using again the p53null HL-60
cells as model system, by utilizing siRNAs to attenuate
p21 expression. As shown in Figure 4C, once confirmed
the effective knock-down of p21 expression through
quantitative RT-PCR both at baseline and after DCA
treatment, we observed a significant (p<0.05) reduction in
DCA-induced cytotoxicity in p21 siRNA transfected cells
with respect to cells transfected with a scrambled control
siRNA. Concurrently, p21 silencing reversed the cell cycle
arrest, as documented by the minor extent in cell blockage
in S phase upon DCA treatment (data not shown). This set
of data confirmed that p21 plays a central role in mediating
cytotoxicity of DCA not only in p53wild-type B leukemic cells
[15] but also in p53deficient leukemic cells.
Subsequently, in order to disclose the mechanism
of p21 regulation by DCA, we attenuate ILF3

DISCUSSION
Agents directed against the unique metabolic
features of cancer cells might represent an opportunity
to improve current treatments, in particular with the
aim of overcoming drug resistance in leukemic cells.
In this context, we have recently demonstrated that the
mitochondria-targeting small molecule DCA promoted
cytotoxicity in p53wild-type primary B-CLL cells and B
leukemic cell lines at concentrations which marginally
affected primary normal peripheral blood mononuclear
cells [15]. However, p53 mutations are known to interfere
with the normal response of human cells to oxidative
stress. The failure of p53 mutant-expressing cells to restore
a reducing oxidative environment is often accompanied by
increased survival [25], which represents an aspect of the
gain of function of the pro-oncogenic activity of mutated
TP53. Thus, it remained to be established whether DCA
was active also on p53mutated leukemic cells.
In this study, we have demonstrated for the first
time that DCA exerts cytotoxic activity in both primary
p53mutated B-CLL cells and p53mutated/null leukemic cell lines,
at levels comparable to primary p53wild-type B-CLL cells,
in a range of concentrations previously used by other
authors in in vitro models of solid tumors [10-12,14].
These findings are particularly remarkable since patients
harboring TP53 mutations have a poor prognosis and still
limited therapeutic options [18]. In addition, we have
demonstrated that DCA induces cell cycle arrest in the G1
phase, senescence, apoptosis, also independently of p53.
Moreover, although it has been previously hypothesized
that the lack of mitochondrial hyperpolarization in
hematological malignancies might render DCA ineffective
in such cases [26], DCA efficiently induced mitochondrial
damage in all p53mutated/null leukemic cell lines investigated.
Indeed, we documented both the morphological

were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (C-D). Data are expressed as arbitrary units (a.u.). In parallel transfected cultures were analyzed for

remodeling of mitochondrial structure and the reduction
in ATP synthesis. Consistently, also the proteomic
analyses revealed a relevant modulation of proteins
involved in the metabolic processes including proteins
of the mitochondrial inner membrane, such as adenine
nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2) [27] and nicotinamide
nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) [28]. Overall, these
data support the notion that DCA cytotoxity in p53mutated
B-CLL cells is also to be ascribed to the metabolic activity
of this compound.
Even though we have previously demonstrated
that DCA activated the p53 pathway and promoted the
transcription of several p53 target genes in p53wild-type B
leukemic cells [15], we have here demonstrated that DCA
induced the transcription of p21 also in a p53-independent
manner in both primary p53mutated B-CLL patient cells and
p53mutated/null leukemic cell lines. Another novel finding
of our study was the identification of the transcription
factor ILF3 as a key protein regulating p21 expression
in leukemic cells and in response to exposure to DCA.
Indeed, the knock-down of ILF3 in p53null HL-60 cells
resulted in the attenuation of p21 expression as well as
in the significant decrease of DCA-mediated cytotoxicity.
Recent studies confirmed that p21 is necessary
for the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction observed
in senescence and this event maintains a constant DNA
damage response leading to prolonged cell cycle arrest
[29]. P21 prevents cancer cell growth due to its ability to
transiently or permanently stop proliferation, thus being
an important component of tumor suppressor mechanisms.
Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that p21 can be
down-regulated by several microRNA expressed in cancer
cells [30,31]. Concurrently, although p21 levels have been
found elevated in some cancers without signs of growth
inhibition [32] and in some experimental settings it has
been proposed that p21 can actually favor transformation
by inhibiting apoptosis [31], other studies have recently
shown that p21 can also trigger cell death [20,29]. At
present, it is not well understood how p21 exerts these
radically different functions or even if they reside in
separate domains of the protein.
In spite of the discrepancies present in the scientific
literature, our current data clearly point to the tumorsuppressor activity of p21 in the context of DCA-induced
cytotoxicity on p53mutated primary B-CLL cells as well
as on p53mutated/null leukemic cell lines. In agreement with
our current data, it has been demonstrated that the in
vitro activation of p21 in B-CLL accurately predicts
the therapeutic response in vivo of B-CLL [20]. Since
p53 mutations still represent one of the major negative
prognosticators of B-CLL, we believe that the therapeutic
potential of DCA should be further evaluated possibly in
combination with other innovative anti-leukemic drugs.

Primary B-CLL patient samples and leukemic cell
lines
For experiments with primary cells, peripheral
blood samples were collected in heparin-coated tubes
from B-CLL patients (n=10) following informed consent,
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and in
agreement with institutional guidelines (UniversityHospital of Ferrara). The patients had been without prior
therapy at least for three weeks before blood collection.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
isolated by gradient centrifugation with lymphocyte cell
separation medium (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, ON,
CAN). T lymphocytes, NK lymphocytes, granulocytes
and monocytes were negatively depleted from peripheral
blood B-CLL with immunomagnetic microbeads (MACS
microbeads, Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA), with a purity
>95% of resulting CD19+ population, as assessed by flow
cytometry analysis and previously described [33].
To analyze the TP53 status, B-CLL patients’ DNA
samples obtained from circulating CD19+ cells were
sequenced on Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine
system using a custom Ion AmpliSeq panel (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) targeting the exonic regions
and the exon-intron boundaries of TP53. Next generation
sequencing data was annotated by a standard ANNOVAR
pipeline supplied by COSMIC v68 database. All selected
variants were validated by Sanger sequencing, first on
genomic DNA and in case of splicing variants on cDNA.
The potential pathogenicity of the identified mutations
and their effects on p53 functionality was predicted by
web tools (SIFT, http://sift.jcvi.org/; PolyPhen-2, http://

and by protein structural bioinformatics analysis (NCBI,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/; PDB, http://pdb.
org; UniProt, http://www.uniprot.org; PFAM, http://pfam.
sanger.ac.uk). The main clinical and molecular parameters
of the B-CLL patients are reported in Table 1.
For the in vitro assays, B-CLL patients’ cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS,
L-glutamine and Penicillin/streptomycin (all from Gibco,
Grand Island, NY) and used within the first 48 hours of
cultures when the mean (±SD) percentage of cell viability
was between 96.5% (±1.8%, in the first 24 hours) and
82.5% (±7.3%, at 48 hours).
The p53mutated B lymphoblastoid leukemic cell lines
MAVER, MEC-1 and MEC-2 and the p53null HL-60
leukemic cell line were purchased from DSMZ (Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH,
Braunschweig, Germany). MAVER and HL-60 cell lines

were routinely cultured in RPMI-1640, whereas MEC-1
and MEC-2 were maintained in IMDM, all supplemented
with 10% FBS, L-glutamine and Penicillin/streptomycin
(all from Gibco). Cells were then treated with DCA (range
1-30 mM; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), and, for selected
experiments, with Nutlin-3 (10 µM; Cayman Chemicals,
Ann Arbor, MI).

previously described [38]. Protein determination was
performed by using the BCA Protein Assay (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of protein for
each sample were migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide
gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, as previously
described [39]. The following Abs were used: anti-p21
(C-19) and anti-tubulin purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and from Sigma-Aldrich,
respectively. After incubation with anti-mouse IgG
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs (SigmaAldrich), specific reactions were revealed with the ECL
Lightning detection kit (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) [40].
Densitometry values were estimated by the ImageQuant
TL software (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Analysis of DCA cytotoxicity
For the in vitro assessment of cytotoxicity, at
different time points post DCA treatment, overall cell
viability was examined by Trypan blue dye exclusion and
MTT assay as previously described [34]. Apoptosis and
cell cycle were analyzed in flow cytometry by Annexin
V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining (Immunotech,
Marseille, France) and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU;
Sigma-Aldrich) incorporation, respectively [35,36],
while senescence was assessed under light microscope
by senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)
staining, using a specific kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Proteomic profiling
To perform one-dimensional gel electrophoresis
(1-DE), for each experimental group triplicates of HL60 cell protein extract (25 µg/replicate) were mixed with
equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer and resolved
on a NuPAGE® Novex® 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Life
Technologies). Each gel lane was manually cut with
a sterile surgical blade into 24 bands of equal height
(about 3 mm) and excised bands were crushed into small
fragments, processed, submitted to in-gel trypsin digestion
and peptide extractions. An aliquot of each digest (2 µl)
was directly analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a LTQ Orbitrap
XL™ (Thermo Scientific), interfaced with a 1200 series
capillary pump (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara,
CA).
For protein identification, tandem mass spectra
were extracted and the charge states deconvoluted by
BioWorks version 3.3.1 (Thermo Scientific). For each
sample, the MS/MS data from the 24 gel bands were
merged and submitted as “mgf” file to the search engine
Mascot (in-house version 2.2.06, Matrix Science, London,
UK). Scaffold (version 3_00_02, Proteome Software
Inc., Portland, ME) was used to validate MS/MS-based
peptide and protein identifications. Mascot was set up to
search both the forward and reversed sequences of the
SwissProt_57.8 database (selected for Humans) assuming
the digestion enzyme trypsin (1 missed cleavage allowed),
mass tolerance of 1.00 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 2.0
ppm. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as
a fixed modification and deamidation of asparagine and
oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications
in both search engines. Peptide identifications were
accepted if they could be established at greater than
95.0%. Protein identifications were accepted if established
at greater than 99.9% probability with at least 2 identified
peptides. Identified proteins were quantified using spectral
counts directly computed by Scaffold and the number of
MS/MS spectra were grouped into “counts” associated
to a specific protein. Spectral counts normalization was

Assessment of mitochondrial alterations
The presence of morphological signs characteristic
of mitochondrial alteration, such as mitochondrial
fragmentation and cristae remodeling, were analyzed by
transmission electron microscopy [37]. Mitochondrial
activity was evaluated by measuring the cellular ATP
production. Briefly, ATP concentration was determined
using the ATP Assay KIT (Abcam) in cell lysates of
untreated and DCA treated cultures at different time points.
Measurements were performed with the colorimetric
method, following the manufacturer’s instructions. ATP
contents were normalized per number of cells.

RT-PCR and Western blot analyses
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the
QIAGEN RNeasy Plus mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany). For RT-PCR, total RNA was transcribed into
cDNA, using the QuantiTect® Reverse Transcription kit
(SABiosciences, QIAGEN). P21 and ILF3 gene expression
was analyzed using the SYBR Green-based RT qPCR
detection method with SABiosciences RT2 Real-TimeTM
Gene expression assays, which include specific validated
primer sets and PCR master mix (SABiosciences). All
samples were run in triplicate using the real-time thermal
analyzer Rotor-GeneTM 6000 (Corbett, Cambridge, UK),
as previously described [37]. Expression values were
normalized to the housekeeping gene POLR2A amplified
in the same sample.
For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed as

Software Inc.). Subsequently estimation of differential
protein abundance was expressed as fold-change (ratio
of the averaged spectral counts in the treated cells to
the averaged spectral counts in the untreated cells)
(Supplementary Table 1). The normalized spectral count
for each identified protein were submitted to SIMCA-P13
software package (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for
multivariate data analysis (OPLS-DA). Variables that had
significant contribution to discrimination between groups
and a significant p-value (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test,
p<0.05), computed using JMP v6 software (SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC), were accepted as significantly modulated
proteins upon treatment and submitted to network analysis
(Supplementary Table 2). Functional interpretation of the
differentially expressed proteins highlighted by proteomics
was built using the MetaCore analytical suite version 5.3
(GeneGo, St. Joseph, MI).

scaled using Pareto scaling and data were analyzed by
orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis
(OPLS-DA). S-plots were calculated to visualize the
relationship between covariance and correlation within
the OPLS-DA results. Variables that showed significant
contribution to discrimination between groups and a
significant change in their expression (Mann-WhitneyWilcoxon test, p<0.05), were accepted as significantly
modulated proteins upon treatment and submitted to
network analysis.

Transfection experiments

REFERENCES

A pool of three specific small interfering RNA
(siRNA) for each gene was resuspended in nucleasefree sterile water. Leukemic cells (2x106 cells/0.1 ml)
were mixed with either 1 μg of control enhanced green
fluorescence protein (EGFP) plasmid or 3 μg of siRNA,
transferred to a 2.0-mm electroporation cuvette and
nucleofected with the nucleofector kit V, using the
nucleofector device (Amaxa Nucleofector II apparatus,
Lonza Cologne AG, Cologne, Germany), as previously
described [41]. Transfection efficiency was monitored
by scoring the percentage of EGFP-positive cells by flow
cytometry analysis as previously described [42]. For p21
and ILF3 gene knock-down, siRNAs were designed and
manufactured by Ambion® (Life Technologies) according
to the guidelines for effective gene knock-down by this
method. The silencer negative control siRNA consisted
of a 19 bp-scrambled sequence with 3’ dT overhangs and
previously tested for the lack of non-specific effects on
gene expression.
