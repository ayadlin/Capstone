Abstract
Breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) are resistant to conventional
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which may destroy tumor
masses but not all BCSC that can mediate relapses. In the present
study, we showed that the level of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in
BCSC is relatively higher than in bulk tumor cells, contributing to
a relatively higher level of therapeutic resistance. We designed a
highly potent small-molecule inhibitor, CWP232228, which
antagonizes binding of b-catenin to T-cell factor (TCF) in the
nucleus. Notably, although CWP232228 inhibited the growth of
both BCSC and bulk tumor cells by inhibiting b-catenin–medi-

ated transcription, BCSC exhibited greater growth inhibition than
bulk tumor cells. We also documented evidence of greater insulinlike growth factor-I (IGF-I) expression by BCSC than by bulk
tumor cells and that CWP232228 attenuated IGF-I–mediated
BCSC functions. These results suggested that the inhibitory effect
of CWP232228 on BCSC growth might be achieved through the
disruption of IGF-I activity. Taken together, our ﬁndings indicate
that CWP232228 offers a candidate therapeutic agent for breast
cancer that preferentially targets BCSC as well as bulk tumor cells.

Introduction

Wnt proteins are a large family of secreted, cysteine-rich molecules that play a critical role in the development of various
organisms (9). The dysfunction of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling
pathway has recently been implicated in several types of human
cancers, including ovarian (10), colon (11), and breast cancers
(12). Interestingly, accumulating evidence has revealed a critical
role for Wnt/b-catenin signaling in CSCs (13). For example,
mammary stem cells with high levels of Wnt/b-catenin signaling
exhibit greater tumorigenic potential than their counterparts with
low Wnt/b-catenin signaling (14). Therefore, these studies suggest
that Wnt/b-catenin signaling is a promising target for treating
breast cancer through inhibiting BCSCs.
Functional Wnt signaling activities require an interaction
between b-catenin and T-cell factor (TCF; ref. 15). The aberrant
activation or transcriptional activity of b-catenin has been associated with breast stem cell ampliﬁcation and tumorigenesis in a
number of studies (16), suggesting that targeting the b-catenin/
TCF protein–protein interaction, rather than other Wnt/b-catenin
signaling components, could effectively target BCSCs . However,
as b-catenin is an intracellular signaling molecule with no discernible enzymatic activity, this protein represents an "undruggable" target (17). Recent studies have demonstrated that small
molecules, including both synthetic and natural compounds,
inhibit Wnt/b-catenin signaling in various cancers through the
direct targeting of b-catenin. Although recently developed synthetic inhibitors targeting b-catenin, such as XAV939 (18) and
IWP-2 (19), effectively inhibit the Wnt–b-catenin pathway under
in vitro culture systems, the poor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) proﬁles of these molecules have prevented
in vivo preclinical investigations. Therefore, the development of
inhibitors that target b-catenin and exhibit better in vivo PK/PD
proﬁles is needed. Herein, we designed a highly potent, selective

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among
women in the Western world (1). Conventional therapies, such as
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have limited effects on
the high rate of breast cancer recurrence (2). Recently, it has been
suggested that a subset of tumor cells, called cancer stem cells
(CSC) or tumor-initiating cells (TIC), contribute to tumor growth,
metastasis, and recurrence (3). Importantly, CSCs are resistant to
conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy (4) and radiotherapy (5). CSCs have been identiﬁed in almost all cancer types,
including colon cancer (6), leukemia (7), and breast cancer (8).
Therefore, therapeutic strategies that selectively target breast cancer
stem cells (BCSC) will ultimately improve breast cancer treatments.

small-molecule inhibitor, namely CWP232228 (U.S. Patent
8,101,751 B2), which antagonizes the binding of b-catenin to
the TCF protein in the nucleus and speciﬁcally downregulates a
subset of Wnt/b-catenin–responsive genes. In vitro and in vivo
studies revealed that CWP232228 suppresses tumor formation
and metastasis without toxicity through the inhibition of the
growth of BCSCs and bulk tumor cells. The dysregulation of
insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling in primary breast
cancers has been associated with radioresistance and tumor
recurrence (20). Although IGF-I is important for the development
of breast cancer, the role of this protein in BCSCs remains unclear.
We also demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, the attenuation of IGF-I–
mediated BCSC sphere formation mediated by CWP232228.
Taken together, these results suggest that targeting b-catenin–
mediated transcription using CWP232228 has signiﬁcant therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
The breast cancer cell lines 4T1 and 67NR were kindly provided
by Dr. Wakeﬁeld, National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD).
Human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF7, MDA-MB-435, and
MDA-MB-231 were obtained from the ATCC. The human breast
carcinoma cell line Hs578t was obtained from the Korean Cell Line
Bank (Seoul, Korea). Murine mammary cancer cell lines 4T1 and
67NR (21) and human mammary carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB435, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, Hs578T (21) were cultured in DMEM
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 100 U/mL streptomycin (Lonza) at 37 C and 5% CO2.
CW232228 is designed by JW Pharmaceutical Corporation. Docetaxel (D-1000) and recombinant IGF-I (#250-19) were purchased
from LC Laboratory (Woburn, MA) and PeproTech, respectively.
Tumorsphere formation
Single cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen)
containing B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (PeproTech), and 4 mg/mL heparin (SigmaAldrich). Primary tumorspheres were derived by plating 50,000 to
200,000 single cells per well into 6-well ultra-low attachment dishes
(Corning). Secondary tumorspheres were plated at 50,000 cells per
well. Dishes were cultivated for 7 days to enumeration of spheres.
Individual spheres 100 mm from each replicate well (n  9 wells)
were counted under an inverted microscope at 50 magniﬁcation
using the Image-Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics). The percentage of cells capable of forming spheres, termed the "tumorsphere formation efﬁciency," was calculated as follows: [(number of
sphere formed/number of single cells plated)  100].
Cell proliferation (cytotoxicity) assay
4T1 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines were seeded in 96-well plates.
Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of CWP232228.
After 48 hours of incubation, cell viability was assessed by cell
counting kit-8 (CCK-8) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The numbers of viable cells were measured at a wavelength of
450 nm using Versamax microplate reader.
Real-time PCR, stem cell PCR array, and Wnt signaling pathway
PCR array
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).
RNA purity was veriﬁed by measuring 260/280 absorbance ratio.

1692 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

The ﬁrst strand of cDNA was synthesized with 2 mg of total RNA
using SuperScript II (Invitrogen), and one tenth of the cDNA was
used for each PCR mixture containing Express SYBR-Green qPCR
Supermix (BioPrince). Real-time PCR was performed using a
Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen). The reaction was subjected to 40-cycle
ampliﬁcation at 95 C for 20 seconds, at 60 C for 20 seconds, and
at 72 C for 25 seconds. Relative mRNA expression of selected
genes was normalized to HPRT and quantiﬁed using the DDCt
method. The sequences of the PCR primers are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The stem cell PCR array (SABiosciences) and
Wnt signaling pathway PCR array (SABiosciences) were performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Flow cytometry
FACS analysis and cell sorting were performed using FACS
Calibur and FACS Aria machines (Becton Dickinson), respectively. FACS data were analyzed using Flowjo software (Tree Star).
Antibodies to the following proteins were used: PE-conjugated
Sca-1 (dilution 1/20), CD44 (dilution 1/40), CD24 (dilution
1/40), CD61 (dilution 1/40), CD133 (dilution 1/40), and LEF1
(dilution 1/40). The FACS gates were established by staining with
isotype antibody or secondary antibody. APC-conjugated rabbit
IgG antibodies (dilution, 1/500; Invitrogen) was used as the
secondary antibody to visualize LEF1 protein expression. The
Aldeﬂuor kit (Stem Cell Technologies) was used to isolate the
population with a high ALDH enzymatic activity. Cells were
stained for ALDH using the Aldeﬂuor reagent according to the
manufacturer's instructions and analyzed on FACSCalibur. As
negative control, for each sample of cell aliquot was treated with
50 mmol/L DEAB, a speciﬁc ALDH inhibitor. Aldeﬂuorpos cells
were quantiﬁed by calculating the percentage of total ﬂuorescent
cells compared with a control staining reaction. FACS Aria
was used to sort Aldeﬂuor-stained cells into Aldeﬂuorneg and
Aldeﬂuorpos cell population.
Luciferase reporter assay
4T1 cells were plated at a density of 2  104 cells per well in
48-well plates, and transfected using Genefectine transfection
reagent (Genetrone Biotech Co.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The TopFlash (Addgene; ref. 22), luciferase
reporter (100 ng), and Renilla luciferase thymidine kinase
construct (Invitrogen; 50 ng) were used to determine luciferase
activity. Luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer
(Glomax, Promega), using a Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Total value of reporter activity in each sample was normalized
to Renilla luciferase activity.
Protein isolation and Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
200 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol)
containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The concentration
of protein was measured with a Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad)
following the manufacturer's protocol. Total protein was subjected to SDSPAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membrane. The blot was probed with primary antibody; anti–
b-catenin (Cell Signaling Technology). As a loading control,
anti–b-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used.
Subsequently, the blots were washed in TBST (10 mmol/L TrisHCl, 50 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.25% Tween-20) and incubated with
a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody. The

Targeting Wnt Signaling in Breast Cancer Stem Cells

presence of target proteins was detected using the enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents (BioNote Inc.).
Immunoﬂuorescent staining
The use of fresh breast tumor specimens was approved by the
research ethic committees at the Korea National Cancer Center.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Samples were
ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for ﬂuorescent staining. Samples
were permeabilized with 0.3 mol/L glycine and 0.3% Triton X100, and nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked with 2% normal swine
serum (DAKO). Staining was performed as described previously
(23), using the primary anti-ALDH1 (Abcam), and anti-LEF1
(Cell Signaling Technology). Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated rabbit
IgG (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize ALDH1 and LEF1.
Samples were examined by ﬂuorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM
510 Meta). The calculation of ALDH1 and LEF1 expression was
based on green ﬂuorescence area and density divided by cell
number, as determined from the number of DAPI-stained nuclei,
in three randomly selected ﬁelds for each specimen from a total of
three independent experiments. For quantitation, an arbitrary
threshold was set to distinguish speciﬁc from background staining, and this same threshold setting was applied to all the samples
analyzed.
Short hairpin RNA
shRNA targeting mouse IGF-I and nontargeting RNA were
purchased from Sigma. For the efﬁcient IGF-I shRNA transfection,
reverse transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We
chose the IGF-I shRNA that is most effective in mRNA levels from
ﬁve shRNA designed from the target sequence and determined by
qRT-PCR and ELISA.
Animal study
All mice were maintained according to Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee-approved protocols of the Lee Gil Ya
Cancer and Diabetes Institute. For titration experiments, anesthetized 7-week-old female Balb/c (Orient Charles River Technology)
and NOD/SCID mice (Korea research institute of bioscience and
biotechnology) were inoculated with 5  104 4T1 cells and 5 
105 MDA-MB-435 cells into the mammary fat pad in 50 mL
volume (n ¼ 10 for each group), respectively. After inoculation,
the mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups (i.p. at
CWP232228 100 mg/kg in PBS) and the control group. For the
combination experiment, 7-week-old female BALB/c mice were
inoculated 4  104 4T1 into the mammary fat pad in 40 mL
volume (n ¼ 10 for each group). After 10 days injection, the mice
were then randomly divided into following four groups: (i) the
control group, (ii) the docetaxel (15 mg/kg, once a week) group,
(iii) the CWP228 (100 mg/kg, daily) group, (4) and the docetaxel
þ CWP group. And it was monitored for 3 weeks.
Lung metastasis animal model
For the metastasis and survival experiment, 9-week-old female
BALB/c mice were inoculated with 5  104 4T1-Luc cells into the
tail vein in 0.1 mL volume. After inoculation, the mice were
randomly assigned to treatment groups (i.p. at CWP232228
100 mg/kg in PBS) and the control group. Mice were euthanized
and lungs were collected on 3 weeks, and ﬁxed with 10% buffered
formalin. Metastasis incidence was assessed via in vivo bioluminescence measurement using an IVIS spectrum (Caliper Life

Sciences). For luciferase detection, 150 mg/mL D-luciferin
(Caliper Life Sciences) in PBS was injected i.p. before imaging.
Photometric measurement of metastasis was done by Living
Image software (V. 3.1.0; Caliper Life Sciences).
In vivo limiting dilution assay
For the limiting dilution experiment, primary tumors were
minced using scissors and incubated in DMEM (Invitrogen)
mixed with collagenase/hyaluronidase (Stem cell Technologies)
at 37 C for 15 to 20 minutes. Primary tumor-derived cells were
inoculated into the mammary fat pad of mice at varying cell
densities ranging from 500 to 50,000 cells in a total volume of 50
mL volume (n ¼ 8 for each group). 4T1 and MDA-MB-435 cells
injected mice were euthanized on 3 and 7 weeks, respectively, and
secondary tumors were excised for analysis. The frequency of TICs
was calculated using extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA)
webtool (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda). The volume
of the primary tumor was measured as previously described (24).
Statistical analysis
All the statistical data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software) and evaluated by the two-tailed Student t
test. A P value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
signiﬁcance.

Results
The stem cell markers Oct4, Sca-1, and ALDH1 are enriched in
sphere-forming subpopulations
It has been suggested that three-dimensional (3D) sphere
cultures of tumor cells from various cancer types, including breast
(25), colon (6), brain, and pancreatic (26) cancers, have enriched
cancer stem/progenitor cell populations. Recent studies have
suggested that the stem cell markers Oct4 (27), Sca-1 (28), and
ALDH1 (29) play important roles in maintaining the pluripotency of BCSCs. In the present study, we established a sphereforming culture system to culture BCSCs as an in vitro model of
breast cancer as previously described (30). To conﬁrm whether
sphere-forming subpopulations are enriched for stem cell–like
properties under 3D culture conditions, we examined the expression proﬁles of the stem cell markers Oct4, Sca-1, ALDH1, and
Sox2. Consistent with previous studies, the expression levels of
these markers were higher in sphere-forming cells than in cells in
monolayers (Supplementary Figs. S1A–S1C and S2B–S2D). We
also performed FACS analysis to quantitate the percentage of the
total cell population that consisted of CD44þ/CD24 cells in
both the monolayer and sphere cultures. As expected, the percentage of cells with this cell surface marker phenotype was
markedly higher in sphere-forming cells than in monolayer cells
(Supplementary Figs. S1D and S2A). To determine whether
sphere-forming subpopulations are enriched for stem cell–like
properties under 3D culture conditions, we performed an ELDA.
Monolayer and sphere-forming cells were harvested and transplanted at limiting dilutions (from 50,000 to 500 cells) into mice.
The repopulating unit frequency of the basal population was 1 of
1,591 for monolayer cultures and 1 of 425 for sphere cultures
(Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, 4T1 sphere-forming subpopulations were compromised in their ability to repopulate
functional BCSCs in a xenograft model, suggesting that these
cells exhibit the characteristics of BCSCs and can be used to
generate BCSCs in culture as an in vitro model for BCSC culture
to evaluate the efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutic drugs.

Enhanced expression of Wnt/b-catenin signaling-associated
genes in putative BCSCs
Recently, accumulating evidence has illustrated a critical role
for Wnt/b-catenin signaling in various CSCs (13). Thus, we used a
stem cell PCR array to identify potential therapeutic targets in
BCSCs (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Consistent with previous studies showing elevated Wnt/b-catenin signaling activity in CSCs, the
signaling array results revealed that Wnt/b-catenin signaling was
activated to a greater extent in sphere-forming cells than in
monolayer cells (Supplementary Fig. S7B). To further assess the
signiﬁcance of Wnt/b-catenin signaling activity in BCSCs, we
examined quantitative changes in the gene expression regulated
through this pathway. The expression of downstream signaling
components of the Wnt–b-catenin signaling pathway, such as
Wnt1, PPAR-d, Dvl1, LEF1, Fzd1, TCF4, and b-catenin, was

1694 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

markedly higher in sphere-forming cells than in monolayer cells
(Fig. 1A).
Previous studies have demonstrated that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) is a marker of both normal and malignant
human mammary stem cells and a predictor of poor clinical
outcomes (31), and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF1),
is a critical regulator of Wnt/b-catenin signaling (32). Therefore, to
examine the regulatory role of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in BCSCs,
we analyzed the LEF1 expression levels in the ALDH-positive
subpopulation. The Aldeﬂuor-positive subpopulation showed a
signiﬁcantly higher level of LEF1 than the Aldeﬂuor-negative
subpopulation in multiple breast cancer cell types (Fig. 1B),
suggesting that ALDH1-positive BCSC subpopulations are highly
associated with enhanced Wnt/b-catenin signaling activity. To
conﬁrm whether ALDH1-positive breast cancer cells represent the

Targeting Wnt Signaling in Breast Cancer Stem Cells

LEF1-positive subpopulation, we investigated the coexpression of
these markers in breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1C), premalignant
MMTV-PyMT mammary tissues (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig.
S8A), and tissue samples from patients with breast cancer (Fig. 1E
and Supplementary Fig. S8B). As shown in Fig. 1C–E, we conﬁrmed that the ALDH1-positive populations mostly overlapped
with LEF1-positive subpopulations in both human and mouse
breast cancer tissues. These results suggest that Wnt/b-catenin
signaling might contribute to tumorigenic potential, representing
a novel therapeutic target for eliminating BCSCs.
The b-catenin inhibitor CWP232228 suppresses BCSC growth
and clonogenicity
Using a cell-based reporter system, we screened a diverse library
of low molecular weight compounds for the inhibition of Wnt/
b-catenin–mediated transcriptional activity. The results showed
that CWP232228 was the most effective Wnt/b-catenin inhibitor
(Supplementary Fig. S9A). A PK/PD analysis in mice indicated
that CWP232228, administered i.v. at a dose of 200 mg/kg,
generated an exposure of the compound in the blood at a
concentration greater than 0.8 mg/mL for 7 hours (Supplementary
Fig. S9B; Supplementary Table S3). Next, we further tested the
efﬁcacy and speciﬁcity of CWP232228 to inhibit Wnt/b-catenin
signaling in breast cancer cells transiently transfected with a
luciferase reporter plasmid in the presence or absence of Wnt3a.
In response to CWP232228 treatment, the transcriptional activity
in breast cancer cells was signiﬁcantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Using Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B) and
immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2C), we further investigated whether
CWP232228 was sufﬁcient to inhibit key components of Wnt/
b-catenin signaling. Consistently, CWP232228 treatment significantly inhibited LEF1 expression in a dose-dependent manner.
Approximate IC50 values were determined using a dose–response
curve. In mouse (4T1) and human (MDA-MB-435) breast cancer
cell lines, the IC50 values were 2 and 0.8 mmol/L, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S10).
As a functional assay, we evaluated the effect of CWP232228 on
primary and secondary sphere formation. Treatment with
CWP232228 resulted in the disruption of primary sphere formation of both 4T1 and MDA-MB-435 cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2D). For the secondary sphere-forming assay, treated
primary spheres were collected and dissociated into single cells.
The cells from treated or untreated primary spheres were replated
on culture dishes without additional treatment. Interestingly, we
observed that in the presence of CWP232228, the cells derived
from primary spheres did not form secondary spheres as efﬁciently as the cells from untreated spheres (Fig. 2D). Moreover, we
evaluated the effect of CWP232228 on the sphere formation of
primary breast cancer cells obtained from four different patient
samples. Before performing in vitro experiments, the primary
breast cancer cells tested positive for cytokeratins 14 expression
and negative for vimentin expression (Supplementary Fig. S3A
and S3B). Treatment with CWP232228 disrupted the sphere
formation of primary breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4D). These ﬁndings suggest
that CWP232228 was sufﬁcient to block subsequent secondary
sphere formation from primary spheres in the absence of additional treatment.
In breast carcinomas, cell populations with high levels of ALDH
activity are enriched in tumorigenic stem/progenitor cells (33).
Therefore, we hypothesized that CWP232228 might disrupt BCSC

sphere formation by regulating ALDH activity. To test this hypothesis, we used FACS analysis to investigate the effect of
CWP232228 on ALDH activity. Indeed, the treatment of 4T1 and
MDA-MB-435 cells with CWP232228 for 48 hours decreased the
size of the ALDH-positive subpopulation (Fig. 2E). In this context,
we examined the expression of BCSC markers in the presence or
absence of CWP232228. Consistent with our hypothesis, the
expression levels of these markers, including the phenotypes
Sca-1þ, CD133þ, CD61þ, CD44þ/CD24, and side populations,
were signiﬁcantly lower after CWP232228 treatment (Supplementary Table S4).
CWP232228 targets chemoresistant BCSCs
It is important to compare CWP232228 with another wellknown small-molecule inhibitor (FH535) that targets the b-catenin/Tcf protein–protein interactions. Because deregulated cell
proliferation is a hallmark of cancer cells, the antiproliferative
effects of these two compounds were determined using the MTT
assay. Overall, these data showed that CWP232228 more effectively suppressed the proliferative potential of MDA-MB-435 cells
and at much lower doses than the well-known small-molecule
inhibitor FH535 (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Normal human
ﬁbroblast cell-based dose-dependent experiments showed no
marked signs of toxicity at the CWP232228 dose used in this
study (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Recently, it has been suggested that BCSCs are resistant to many
conventional therapeutic approaches, including chemotherapy
(24) and radiotherapy (34). Thus, although traditional approaches might kill the majority of tumor cells, some of the BCSCs
remain unaffected, surviving and generating new tumors. To
investigate the association between chemoresistance and Wnt/
b-catenin signaling, we evaluated the available breast cancer
datasets using the Oncomine dataset repository (www.oncomine.org). After speciﬁcally ﬁltering for breast cancer datasets
showing a response or nonresponse to conventional docetaxel
treatment, we observed signiﬁcant correlations between chemoresistance and the expression of negative (GSK3b) or positive
(TCF4) regulators of Wnt/b-catenin signaling (Fig. 3A and B).
Importantly, we observed that both the size of ALDH-positive
populations and the sphere formation in 4T1 and MDA-MB-435
cells increased in response to conventional docetaxel treatment.
However, the docetaxel-enriched ALDH-positive populations
(Fig. 3C and D) and sphere formation (Fig. 3E and F) were
markedly reduced after CWP232228 treatment, suggesting that
CWP232228 targets BCSC populations are enriched in cells
resistant to conventional chemodrugs.
CWP232228 reduces tumor growth in a murine xenograft
model
We further investigated the in vivo efﬁcacy of CWP232228 on
tumorigenesis using a mouse xenograft model. Importantly,
CWP232228 treatment (100 mg/kg, administered i.p.) resulted
in a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor volume (Fig. 4A–C). No
signiﬁcant changes in mortality (Supplementary Fig. S6A), body
weight (Supplementary Fig. S6B), hematologic values (Supplementary Fig. S6C), and hemolytic potential (Supplementary Fig.
S6D) were observed, indicating that CWP232228-associated toxicity was minimal. No obvious clinical signs, including anorexia,
salivation, diarrhea, vomiting, polyuria, anuria, and fecal changes,
were observed. In addition, no signiﬁcant differences in body
weight were observed in mice inoculated with cancer cells

Effect of CWP232228 on the growth and clonogenicity of BCSCs. b-Catenin–responsive TOPFlash luciferase assays revealed that CWP232228 inhibits recombinant
Wnt3a-induced Wnt/b-catenin signaling in mouse breast cancer cells (4T1). CWP232228 treatment strongly attenuated Wnt3a-induced TOPFlash activity (A). B and C,
the inhibitory effect of CWP232228 on the expression of LEF1, a Wnt/b-catenin signaling target gene, was assessed in 4T1 cells through Western blot analysis (B)

CWP232228 treatment led to a smaller ALDH-positive subpopulation (Fig. 4D and E). The antitumor effects of CWP232228

basal population was 1 of 1,415 and 1 of 1 for controls and 1 of
7,621 and 1 of 1,510 for CWP232228 treatment in 4T1 and MDAMB-435 cells, respectively (Table 1). Therefore, CWP232228 did
not decrease the repopulation frequency of functional BCSCs in a
xenograft model.
CWP232228 targets BCSCs, bulk tumors, and metastatic tumors
An ideal and completely curative breast cancer treatment targets
both BCSCs and bulk tumor cells to prevent recurrence. For each
xenotransplant, we observed the signiﬁcant inhibition of tumor
growth induced through CWP232228 treatment alone or in
combination with docetaxel (Fig. 5A). Docetaxel treatment alone
moderately affected tumor growth (Fig. 5A). In bulk tumors, the
percentage of ALDH1-positive cells increased with conventional
docetaxel treatment (Fig. 5B). However, these docetaxel-enriched

ALDH-positive populations were markedly reduced after
CWP232228 treatment (Fig. 5B). Moreover, we used metastatic
i.v. 4T1 cell models to investigate the effects of CWP232228 on the
metastasis of breast cancer. We used cells stably expressing ﬁreﬂy
luciferase and whole-body bioluminescence to noninvasively
detect i.v. injected xenografts. Lung metastasis was signiﬁcantly
lower in the CWP232228-treated groups than in the untreated
control groups (Fig. 5C). An overall increase in the survival of
animals treated with CWP232228 was also observed (Fig. 5D).
These results indicated that CWP232228 treatment alone is effective against conventional docetaxel-enriched BCSC populations,
bulk tumors, and metastatic tumors in vivo.

spheres to identify potential downstream targets of
CWP232228 using a Wnt/b-catenin target PCR array. We
screened differentially expressed genes associated with Wnt/
b-catenin signaling. Two criteria for the selection of gene
expression differences were used: A signiﬁcant t test and
fold-change magnitude. Among the genes examined, the level
of IGF-I mRNA was signiﬁcantly enhanced (9-fold upregulated) in BCSCs (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, in both Wnt/b-catenin–targeting PCR array (Fig. 6B) and immunocytochemical
analysis (Fig. 6C), CWP232228 treatment was correlated with
decreased IGF-I levels (8-fold downregulated) under sphereforming conditions. Previous studies demonstrated that the
expression of IGF-I in breast cancer tissues (35) and serum
levels of this protein in breast cancer patients (36) are signif-

CWP232228 (100 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle
(PBS). B and C, tumor volumes were
measured as described in Materials and
Methods. D and E, the effects of
CWP232228 on the ALDH-positive
subpopulation as a proportion of the
total cells in bulk tumors were assessed
through ﬂow cytometric analysis. 4T1
and MDA-MB-435 xenografts from mice
treated with CWP232228 or vehicle
were dissociated into single-cell
suspensions and injected into the
mammary fat pads of mice in limiting
dilutions (50,000, 10,000, 2,000, and

icantly higher than those in healthy individuals. Therefore, it is
reasonable to hypothesize that CWP232228 suppresses the
growth of BCSCs and bulk tumors through the disruption of
IGF-I activity. Consistently, these results revealed that compared with control cells, IGF-I knockdown (Supplementary Fig.
S12) led to smaller ALDH-positive subpopulations (Fig. 6D)
and decreased BCSC sphere formation (Fig. 6E). The stimulatory effects of IGF-I on BCSC sphere formation were successfully attenuated after CWP232228 treatment (Fig. 6F). To
further evaluate the CWP232228-mediated inhibition of
IGF-I secretion, we performed an ELISA to quantitate the levels
of IGF-I in both monolayer and sphere cultures with or without
CWP232228 treatment. Consistent with immunocytochemical
results, CWP232228 treatment signiﬁcantly decreased IGF-I
secretion under sphere-forming conditions (Supplementary

NOTE: 4T1 and MDA-MB-435 xenografts from mice treated with CWP232228 or vehicle were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and injected into the mammary
fat pads of mice in limiting dilutions (50,000; 10,000; 2,000; 500). Tumor formation was observed for 4weeks (4T1 cells) and 8 weeks (MDA-MB-435 cells) following
inoculation. BCSC frequency was calculated using ELDA.

Fig. S13). These results suggest that the suppressive effects of
CWP232228 on BCSCs are achieved through the disruption of
IGF-I activity.

Discussion
Approximately 30% to 50% of the patients diagnosed with
early-stage breast cancer are likely to progress to the metastatic
stage, despite treatment with surgery and/or chemotherapy (37).
Thus, the CSC concept has emerged as an important milestone in

the understanding of chemodrug resistance and cancer recurrence
(38). On the basis of their characteristics, targeting and eradicating
CSCs represent a potential strategy for signiﬁcantly improving
clinical outcomes. Moreover, Fillmore and colleagues (39)
revealed a 30-fold increase in the BCSC population in various
breast cancer cell lines after conventional chemotherapy. The
available conventional therapeutic agents primarily eliminate
the bulk of a tumor mass but do not affect BCSCs (40). Thus,
the identiﬁcation and development of BCSC-targeting therapeutic
agents is urgent.

In recent years, a number of studies have suggested that the
dysregulation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling occurs in human breast
cancer (41). In this context, the high expression of b-catenin might
be an important clinical and pathologic feature of breast cancers
and a predictor of poor overall survival (42). Mutations in the Nterminal domain of b-catenin have been observed in 92% of
patients with metaplastic breast carcinoma (43). Consistent with
these ﬁndings, the results of the present study showed that the
levels of Wnt/b-catenin signaling activities observed in BCSCs
were signiﬁcantly higher than those of bulk cancer cells, although
both bulk tumor cells and BCSCs exhibit a basal level of Wnt/
b-catenin signaling (Fig. 1). These results suggested that BCSCs are
sensitive to therapeutic approaches targeted against Wnt/b-catenin. The b-catenin–TCF interaction is required for functional Wnt/
b-catenin signaling (15); therefore, the inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling through the direct targeting of b-catenin is considered an attractive therapeutic strategy. Despite academic pursuit
and industrial investment, there is currently no small-molecule
inhibitor approved for human use. The majority of the inhibitors
developed so far are in the preclinical or early clinical phase of
development: XAV939 (Novartis Pharmaceuticals) and JW55

and LGK974 (Novartis Pharmaceuticals) are in phase I/II trials. If
these chemical inhibitors prove to be both safe and effective for
treating human cancer, then these molecules will represent powerful tools to target chemotherapy-resistant CSCs that promote
metastasis.
Here, to inhibit the growth and/or self-renewal capacity of
BCSCs through the suppression of b-catenin–mediated signaling,
we used the small-molecule inhibitor CWP232228, identiﬁed in a
high-throughput screen. Follow-up analyses using this compound revealed a reduction in the expression of a Wnt/b-catenin
luciferase reporter and the inhibition of the expression of the Wnt/
b-catenin target gene LEF1 (Fig. 2A–C). Notably, whereas
the inhibition of b-catenin–mediated transcription through
CWP232228 had inhibitory effects on the growth of BCSCs and
bulk tumor cells, BCSCs showed a markedly greater degree of
growth inhibition (Figs. 3–5). Moreover, CWP232228 treatment
was sufﬁcient to block subsequent secondary BCSC sphere formation in vitro (Fig. 2D) and secondary tumor development in the

Targeting Wnt Signaling in Breast Cancer Stem Cells

xenograft model (Table 1), without additional treatment. These
ﬁndings suggest that CWP232228 inhibits the initiation of tumor
development and disrupts the physiologic requirements for BCSC
maintenance. The observation of markedly reduced ALDH-positive BCSC populations in bulk tumors treated with CWP232228
further supports this interpretation (Fig. 4D and E).
Breast cancer is likely to metastasize to multiple organs, primarily including the lungs, liver, and the brain. Therefore, we
investigated the effect of CWP232228 on metastasis using breast
cancer cell xenograft models. For this purpose, the mice were i.v.
injected with mouse breast cancer cells expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase
(4T1-Luc), and the cells were noninvasively detected on the basis
of bioluminescence. CWP232228 signiﬁcantly reduced tumor
bioluminescence in a fast-growing metastatic model of mouse
breast cancer. This decrease in 4T1-Luc cells reﬂects both the
number of metastatic cancer cells (data not shown), and the
tumor volume as the bioluminescent signal was measured across
the whole body, integrating both optical parameters (Fig. 5C).
Importantly, this efﬁcacy was achieved without affecting primary
toxicity parameters, such as mortality, body weight, hematologic
values, and hemolytic potential (Supplementary Fig. S6).
The aberrant activation or transcriptional activity of b-catenin
has been correlated with breast stem cell ampliﬁcation and tumorigenesis in a number of studies (16). Moreover, studies aiming to
target CSCs have primarily focused on disrupting their self-renewal
capacity rather than directly causing toxic effects; these drugs could,
therefore, be less toxic than conventional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs, as reﬂected by their higher than anticipated IC50
values (44). This result suggests that the b-catenin–TCF interaction,
rather than other Wnt/b-catenin signaling components could be an
effective therapeutic target in BCSCs.
The IGF signaling pathway is one of the most important regulators of the growth, migration, and invasion of various types of
cancer (45). Several in vitro experimental studies have provided
substantial evidence of a role for IGF-I signaling in human breast
cancer. The overexpression of the IGF-I receptor in the mouse
mammary gland results in rapid mammary tumorigenesis (46).
Clinical studies also support the importance of IGF-I in breast
cancer. IGF-I is detected at high levels in tissue specimens (35) and
serum samples (36) from breast cancer patients compared with
those from healthy individuals. Moreover, the constitutive activities of IGF-I in breast cancer cells are highly associated with
radioresistance and tumor recurrence (20). These studies might
eventually reveal a role for IGF-I in breast malignancies with respect
to tumor growth, metastatic progression, and resistance to therapy.
Although the IGF-I system is important in breast cancer development, the mechanisms underlying the potential role of this protein
in BCSCs remain largely unknown. Cross-talk between IGF-I and
Wnt/b-catenin signaling was recently reported in colon cancer
(47), oligodendroglial cells (48), and chondrocytes (49). Therefore, the interactions between these two signaling pathways in
BCSCs are intriguing and need further investigation. In the present
study, we also provided the ﬁrst evidence that IGF-I is expressed at

higher levels in BCSCs than in non-BCSCs. Furthermore, we
observed an attenuating effect of CWP232228 on IGF-I–mediated
functions in BCSC sphere formation and ALDH-positive BCSC
populations (Fig. 6). The importance of IGF-I in the growth and/or
self-renewal capacity of BCSCs is consistent with previous observations from breast cancer cell lines (50). These studies suggest that
IGF-I signaling is critical for the tumorigenicity and maintenance of
BCSCs, and these cells could be selectively targeted to improve
clinical outcomes through the inhibition of BCSCs.
In summary, these results provide the ﬁrst demonstration that
the small-molecule inhibitor CWP232228 inhibits Wnt/b-catenin
signaling and depletes BCSCs from bulk tumors. BCSC-depleted
tumor cell populations showed diminished self-renewal capacity
and decreased tumorigenicity. These ﬁndings suggest that the
inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling suppresses the growth and
functionality of BCSCs, which might be key drivers of breast
cancer metastasis and recurrence. To the best of our knowledge,
the effect of CWP232228 on breast tumorigenesis has not previously been assessed. Taken together, these results suggest that by
antagonizing the binding of b-catenin to the TCF protein in the
nucleus, b-catenin inhibitors, speciﬁcally CWP232228, might be
novel BCSC-targeting agents for the treatment of breast cancer.
