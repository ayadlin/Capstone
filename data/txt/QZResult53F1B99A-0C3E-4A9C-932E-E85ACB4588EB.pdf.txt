ABSTRACT
Piper longum L. is a well-known traditional antihyperlipidemic medicine in China,
containing medicinal constituents of piperine, pipernonaline and piperlonguminine in
its fruit. However, the antitumor properties of these constituents have not yet been
studied. We found that potassium piperate (GBK), a derivative of piperine, inhibited
proliferation of cancer cells. GBK selectively inhibited the G1-S-phase transition in
breast cancer cells and the G1 arrest was correlated with induction of p27 expression,
which is an inhibitor for cyclin-dependent kinases, and inhibition of cyclin A, cyclin
E and cyclin B expression. Moreover, GBK treatment led to a downregulation of the
mini-chromosome maintenance protein expression and induction of mitochondrialdependent cell apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Our results also suggested that GBK
might also inhibit cancer cell proliferation through epigenetic signaling pathways. A
synergistic effect in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation was found when GBK was
combined with chemotherapy medicines etoposide phosphate or cisplatin at middle
or low doses in vitro. These results show that GBK is a novel potential anti-breast
cancer drug that inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis.

aromatase inhibitors are the first-line adjuvant targeted
therapies for patients with early stage ER-positive breast
cancer [7, 8]. The humanized monoclonal antibody
trastuzumab has significantly improved disease-free
and overall survival in early stage and advanced HER2positive breast cancer. Thus, trastuzumab is used as a firstline targeted treatment strategy for HER2-positive breast
cancer [9]. There are no recommended targeted therapies
for triple-negative breast cancer other than standard
chemotherapies, such as anthracyclines and taxanes [8].
The hallmarks of cancer include sustained
proliferative signaling, evasion of growth suppressors,
resistance to cell death, replicative immortality,
angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, reprogramming
of energy metabolism and evasion of immune destruction
[10, 11]. Targeting these hallmarks is a rational approach

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common tumor type
observed among women worldwide and is the secondleading cause of cancer death in females [1]. Breast cancer
is a heterogeneous disease, and the molecular subtypes of
breast cancer are classified based on the expression of
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [2]. The
subtypes are different in their biology, prognostic impact,
treatment strategies and pattern of metastasis. Current
treatment strategies for breast cancer include adjuvant
therapies, such as chemotherapy and endocrine therapy,
accompanied with surgical resection [3–6]. ER activation
drives breast carcinogenesis in ER-positive breast cancer.

to next-generation cancer therapy. Cisplatin is widely used
in advanced breast cancer treatment as a cell cycle phase
nonspecific agent [12]. Anthracyclines, e.g., doxorubicin,
are a redox-interfering drug to treat solid and non-solid
malignancies [13]. Ixabepilone is a new antineoplastic
agent that can stabilize microtubule dynamics and lead
to apoptotic cell death [14]. Mitoxantrone induces energy
imbalance to treat breast cancer [13]. Although effective
in tumor therapy, these drugs may lead to side effects,
and development of primary and acquired resistance to
chemotherapy limit their use in subsequent therapies.
Despite the currently available treatment options, breast
cancer remains in the top three leading causes of cancer
death of women. Thus, there is a great need to develop
new therapeutic agents for clinical treatment.
Piper longum L. is a well-known traditional
antihyperlipidemic medicine in China that contains
medicinal constituents of piperine (GBO), pipernonaline
and piperlonguminine (GBN) in its fruit [15]. These
constituents exhibit antihyperlipidemic activity, which is
comparable to that of the commercial antihyperlipidemic
drug simvastatin [15]. Extensive study of GBN validates
that it has high antihyperlipidemic activity and low
cytotoxicity [16]. During the synthesis procedure of
GBN, there is an intermediate product potassium piperate
(GBK) that also shows antihyperlipidemic activity
but is a hydrophilic compound relative to lipophilic
GBO (unpublished data). Another report showed that
Piperlongumine, which is also a natural product isolated
from the plant species Piper longum L., can increase the
level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptotic
cell death of cancer cells, but it has little effect on either
rapidly or slowly dividing primary normal cells [17].
Piplartine, an alkaloid/amide component of the Piper
species, induces inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation,
triggering both apoptosis and necrosis pathways [18].
However, the anti-cancer properties of GBK have not
been explored yet. In this study, we aim to characterize
the effects of GBK on breast cancer and elucidate
the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for
proliferation inhibition.

treated with GBK at 0 to 290 μg/ml for 48 h. Cell viability
was then measured by CCK-8 assay. GBK treatment
markedly increased cell death in cancer cells but not in
normal cells, indicating that GBK exhibits a cancer cellselective killing property.
To determine whether GBK inhibits anchoragedependent growth, we performed colony formation assays.
MCF-7, SUM-159, SGC-7901, MCF-10A and GES-1 cells
were treated with GBK at 0–400 μg/ml concentrations
for 14 days, and the colony formation capacity was
determined by counting the number of colonies stained by
crystal violet. GBK exhibited cytotoxicity only in tumor
cells (MCF-7, SUM159 and SGC-7901) and not in normal
human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) or human gastric
mucosa cells (GES-1) at less than 290 μg/ml. At higher
concentration of GBK (400 μg/ml), slight cytotoxicity
was observed in MCF-10A normal human breast epithelial
cells. Notably, GBK was effective in killing cancer cells
at concentrations less than 100 μg/ml (Figure 1E and
Supplementary Figure 1).
We next further investigated whether GBK affects
cellular proliferation of human cancer cells. We analyzed
the effects of GBK on the proliferation of three breast
cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159)
in dose-dependent and time-dependent experiments. Cell
viability was measured by CCK-8 analysis. Treatment of
three different breast cancer cell lines with 0 to 580 μg/
ml GBK for 48 h revealed a dose-dependent decrease in
cell proliferation (Figure 1F). We also observed inhibition
of proliferation of cells incubated with 290 μg/ml (IC50 of
MCF-7) GBK for 0, 1, 3 and 5 days in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 1F).

GBK selectively inhibits the G1-S-phase
transition of MCF-7 cells
To determine whether the growth inhibition of
cancer cells by GBK was caused by cell cycle arrest,
cells were treated with various concentrations of GBK
for 48 h and cell cycle distributions were analyzed
by flow cytometry. We found that upon exposure to
increased concentrations of GBK, only the breast cancer
cell line MCF-7 showed a G1 phase arrest accompanied
by a decrease in S phase compared with untreated
control cells (Figure 2A and 2B, Supplementary Figure
2). We further investigated the effects of GBK on MCF7 cell cycle progression in time course experiments.
Proliferating MCF-7 cells were treated with 290 μg/ml
GBK for 12, 24 or 48 h. We observed an increase in
G1 phase cells in GBK-treated MCF-7 cells relative to
the control groups receiving no GBK (Figure 2C). In
parallel, there was a reduction in the percentage of S
phase cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate
that GBK selectively inhibits the G1-S-phase transition
and causes a G1 cell cycle arrest in the MCF-7 breast
cancer cell line.

RESULTS
Selective killing effect of GBK in cancer cells
The anti-cancer effects of GBK, a derivative of
piperine, have not been previously investigated. We thus
examined the effects of GBK on the viability of cultured
cancer cells and normal cells (Figure 1C and 1D). The
IC50 values of GBK in various human cancer cell lines
and normal cell lines were determined by CCK-8 assay
(Supplementary Table 1). Cultured normal cell lines
(MCF-10A, HSF, GES-1, L132 and COS-7) and human
cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SUM-159, SGC-7901, BGC823, HepG2, and A549) were grown in 96-well plates and

expression patterns between MCF-7 and SGC-7901
cells in the presence or absence of GBK treatment (GBK

To investigate the molecular mechanisms by
which GBK selectively blocks cell cycle progression in
breast cancer cells, we carried out a microarray analysis

differences between GBK-sensitive (MCF-7) and GBK-

upregulated (>2-fold) and 178 downregulated (< 0.5-fold)
genes after GBK treatment (Figure 3A).
Further analyses revealed that GBK stimulated
different sets of genes between MCF-7 and SGC-7901
cells (Figure 3B and 3C, Supplementary Table 2 and
Supplementary Table 3). In particular, GBK treatment
altered the expression of genes involved in DNA
replication and cell cycle in MCF-7 cells (Figure 3B and
3C, Supplementary Table 2). In contrast, GBK did not

affect these genes in SGC-7901 cells and instead affected
genes in steroid hormone biosynthesis signaling pathways
(Figure 3B and 3C, Supplementary Table 3). These data
indicate that GBK treatment mainly interferes with DNA
replication and cell cycle signaling in MCF-7 cells.
To verify the microarray data showing that the
most differentially expressed genes in MCF-7 cells after
GBK treatment are related with DNA replication and
cell cycle progression, we performed RT-qPCR using

the same total RNA prepared for the microarray (Figure
4A and Supplementary Figure 3). Among deregulated
genes, the genes related with DNA replication and cell
cycle were selected. For instance, we examined the
MCM protein family that is essential for initiation and
elongation of DNA replication in all eukaryotes (MCM2,
MCM3, MCM4, MCM6, MCM7, MCM8 and MCM10),
cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) that play
critical roles in the control of cell cycle progression
(cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin B2, cyclin E2 and cyclin
F), the components of pre-replication complex (preRC) and the proteins involved in activation of the preRC and initiation of replication (CDC6, CDC45, CDT1,
ORC3, ORC6, GMNN, GINS3, PCNA, POLD2 and
POLD3), and the E2F family transcriptional factors that
trigger G1 cell cycle progression (E2F1, E2F2, E2F7
and E2F8). All these genes showed a tendency towards
decreased expression after GBK treatment, consistent
with the results from the transcriptional microarray
analysis, suggesting that the microarray data is reliable.
Specifically, we observed a > 2-fold downregulation in
expression of cyclin E and cyclin A (cyclin E and CDK2
interact during the G1 to S transition, CDK2-cyclin A
regulates S phase progression), MCM2 and MCM10
(MCM2-7 complex serves as the DNA helicase during
replication, MCM10 may serve as the coordinator for
MCM2-7 helicase and DNA polymerase, facilitating their
roles during replication initiation and elongation), ORC6
and CDC45 (ORC is the eukaryotic origin recognition
complex, and the CDC45-MCM2-7-GINS complex acts
as the active replicative helicase), and E2F7 (E2F family
transcriptional factors stimulate the expression of proteins
required in S phase). In addition, we speculated that the
genes in the same signaling pathways as the identified
deregulated genes should also show differential expression
after GBK treatment, even though they were not selected
by microarray analysis. We selected the tumor suppressor
gene p53 and Rb and cell cycle-related genes cyclin D,
cyclin E and CDK2 for RT-qPCR, and found that p53 was
upregulated and Rb, cyclin D, cyclin E and CDK2 were
downregulated after GBK treatment.
We also investigated whether the expression
level of cell cycle and DNA replication-related proteins
was altered with GBK treatment. MCF-7 cells were
incubated with various concentrations of GBK for 48
h and examined by western blot analysis. We observed
a dose-dependent activation of the tumor suppressor
p53 as well as decreased expression of G1/S cell cycleregulating factors cyclin E, cyclin B1, E2F7, and DNA
replication-related proteins MCMs, CDC45, ORC6, and
ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRMI) in MCF-7 cells after
exposure to increasing concentrations of GBK (Figure
4B). In addition, the levels of the CDK inhibitor p27 were
induced by GBK treatment in a time-dependent manner,
while MCMs and cyclin E showed a time-dependent
decrease in expression level (Figure 4B). Furthermore,
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that GBK-treated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells showed an increase in the binding of p27 to the cyclin
E/CDK2 complex compared to untreated control (Figure
4C), thus inhibiting releasing E2F transcription factor to
trigger G1 cell cycle progression. These data reveal that
the inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation by GBK is
associated with the induction of G1/S phase arrest.
We proposed that the anti-cancer mechanism of
GBK in MCF-7 cells is by induction of G1 arrest. GBK
treatment would somehow propagate the signal via a
downstream substrate such as p53, which would in turn
activate the transcription of CDK inhibitor p27, suppress
the activities of G1/S-CDK complexes (cyclin E/CDK2),
inhibit the phosphorylation of Rb protein, restrict the
release of Rb from E2F, and lead to downregulation of
MCM transcription and replicative arrest.

GBK induces MCF-7 cell apoptosis
We further examined the cancer cell apoptosis
induced by GBK using Annexin V/propidium iodide
(PI) staining and flow cytometry analysis. MCF-7 breast
cancer cells showed a concentration-dependent increase
in apoptosis in response to GBK exposure (Figure 5A
and 5B). Morphology analysis confirmed that MCF-7
cells exhibited apoptotic characteristics after treatment
with GBK for 48 h, with apoptotic nuclear morphology
observed with Hoechst 33258 staining, such as nuclear
condensation and fragmentation (Figure 5C). Treatment of
MCF-7 cells with 0–580 μg/ml GBK for 48 h also resulted
in a dose-dependent activation of caspase 6 and caspase 9
by ELISA (Figure 5D).
Previous studies have demonstrated that MAPK
signaling pathways are central regulators of cell growth
and apoptosis in response to stress conditions [19]. ERK is
a mitogen-activated proliferation factor, whereas JNK and
p38 MAPK play key roles in crosstalk between apoptosis
and autophagy induced by genotoxic stress [20]. We found
that stimulation of MCF-7 cells with GBK induced an
increase in phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 5E). Consistently, GBK
dose-dependently increased the expression of Cle-PARP.
These results indicated that GBK induced cell apoptosis
in MCF-7 cells through activation of JNK and p38 MAPK
pathways.
Our results revealed that the mechanism by which
GBK induced apoptosis is via activating the caspase 6 and
caspase 9-dependent pathway, and that p38/JNK MAPK
signaling pathways also play a crucial role in the GBKinduced apoptosis. These results suggest that the anticancer effect of GBK is also associated with the induction
of cell apoptosis.

GBK induced cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells is
independent of intracellular ROS generation
Normal cells have low basal levels of ROS and
therefore a diminished reliance on the ROS stress response

pathway, whereas cancer cells have high levels of ROS
and might therefore be expected to have a strong reliance
on the ROS stress response pathway [17]. Thus, perturbing
redox and ROS homeostasis by therapeutic agents is a
promising strategy for cancer treatment [17, 21]. We
next determined the effect of GBK on cellular ROS
levels in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells through flow
cytometry using the redox-sensitive fluorescent probe 2’ -,
7’-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Treatment
with 290 μg/ml GBK for 0.5 h to 3 h caused a marked
increase in ROS levels in MCF-7 cells relative to normal
cells (Figure 6A). Moreover, treatment of MCF-7 cells
with GBK also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in
ROS levels (Figure 6B). Co-treatment with NAC partially
reversed the GBK-induced increase in ROS but had no
effect on GBK-induced cell death (Figure 6C and 6D).
In contrast to the results in MCF-7 cells, GBK did not
cause an increase in ROS levels in human gastric mucosa
cells GES-1 (Figure 6A), indicating a selective induction
of ROS in breast cancer cells. These results revealed that
GBK could mediate ROS elevation in MCF-7 cells, but

GBK-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells is independent of
intracellular ROS generation

In vivo antitumor effects of GBK on NOD/SCID
mice bearing MCF-7 xenografts
To evaluate the role of GBK in controlling
mammary tumor growth in vivo, we examined the ability
of GBK to suppress the growth of MCF-7 xenografts
in NOD/SCID mice. When tumor sizes had grown to
about 5–6 mm in diameter in NOD/SCID mice bearing
MCF-7 xenografts, GBK (10 mg/kg) or physiological
saline (0.9% m/v) was administered intraperitoneally
daily for 21 days and notable anti-tumor effects were
observed. Treatment with GBK resulted in a significant
reduction in tumor volume compared to that observed
in the vehicle group (P < 0.05) (Figure 7A and 7B). The
tumor weight was decreased by GBK administration
at the dosage of 10 mg/kg (Figure 7C). There was no
obvious change in the body weights of the mice during
treatment (Figure 7D). In addition, GBK treatment

inhibited the formation of blood vessels in xenografttumor mice (Figure 7E).
At day 21, mice were euthanized and tumors were
excised and processed for histological examination. The
vehicle-treated control mice showed severe malignant
progression. In contrast, the tissues from GBK-treated
mice showed a hyperplastic-like, non-malignant
phenotype (Figure 7F). Immunohistochemical stainings
of cyclin E, MCM2, VEGF, CDC6 and BCL2 were
performed in tumor tissues, and the staining intensities of
cyclin E, MCM2, CDC6 and BCL2 were decreased in the
GBK treatment group in xenograft-tumor mice compared
to the control group (Figure 7G). The vehicle-treated
tumor sections showed high expression of VEGF, but no
obvious level of staining was observed in the GBK-treated
tissue sections (Figure 7G). These results revealed a potent
inhibitory effect of GBK on MCF-7 tumor growth in vivo.

The model for the role of GBK in inhibiting breast
tumorigenesis is illustrated in Figure 8.
Sustained proliferative signaling is one of the
hallmarks of cancer. The MCM protein family is essential
for DNA replication in all eukaryotes, and thus anti-MCM
molecules can be used as potential anti-cancer drugs
[22]. We demonstrated in this paper that GBK selectively
inhibited the G1-S-phase transition in breast cancer cells
and the G1 arrest was correlated with induction of p27
expression, which is an inhibitor for cyclin-dependent
kinases, and inhibition of cyclin A, cyclin E and cyclin
B expression. Moreover, GBK treatment led to a
downregulation of the mini-chromosome maintenance
protein expression. Progression from the G1 phase to the S
phase of the cell cycle is stimulated by cyclin D-CDK4/6
and cyclin E-CDK2, followed by phosphorylation
and inactivation of pRB, which releases the E2F
transcriptional factor and enables cells to progress through
the G1/S checkpoint and commit to DNA synthesis [23,
24]. Interestingly, we found the DNA replication negative
regulator geminin was also downregulated in GBK-treated
MCF-7 cells (Figure 4A). A previous study reported that
suppression of geminin activity could selectively kill
cancer cells by inducing DNA re-replication and DNA
damage that spontaneously triggered apoptosis [25].
Thus, we propose that one of the anti-tumor mechanisms
of GBK treatment would somehow propagate the signal
via a downstream substrate such as p53, which would
in turn activate the transcription of the CDK inhibitor
p27 and increase the binding of p27 to CDK2, suppress
the activities of G1/S-CDK (cyclin E/CDK2), inhibit
the phosphorylation of Rb protein, restrict the release
of Rb from E2F, and lead to downregulation of MCM
transcription and replicative arrest.
Resisting cell death is another hallmark of cancer.
Several pro-apoptotic genes, such as BMF, BAX and
NOXA genes, were upregulated after GBK treatment
in MCF-7 cells while pro-survival genes (such as BCL2 and BIRC5 genes) showed reduced mRNA levels
(Supplementary Figure 3A and Supplementary Table 5).
JNK is an important signaling factor in triggering the
mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway in cancer cells
[26–28]. We found that the enzymatic activity of caspase 6
and caspase 9 were increased in MCF-7 cells treated with
GBK. JNK was also phosphorylated after GBK treatment.
We thus concluded that when MCF-7 cells were treated
with GBK, the JNK-induced mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway was activated.
Aberrant DNA methylation frequently occurs
in carcinogenesis [29, 30]. Dysregulation of tumor
DNA methylation includes global hypomethylation
and hypermethylation of CpG islands at the promoters
of tumor suppressor genes, both of which have been
observed in almost every cancer type [31, 32]. Aberrant
DNA methylation is also an important mechanism

Synergistic antitumor effect of GBK with
cisplatin or etoposide phosphate
To further investigate whether GBK could be
used in clinical treatment for breast cancers, we tested
the antitumor effect of GBK when used in combination
with cisplatin (DDP) or etoposide phosphate (VP-16).
MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations
of GBK, VP-16 or DDP, either alone or in combination,
for 48 h and cytotoxicity effects were measured by CCK8 assays. MCF-7 cells treated with GBK (0–100 μg/
ml), VP-16 (0–100 μg/ml), or DDP (0–20 μg/ml) for 48
h all showed inhibition of cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner (Tables 1, 2 and 3). The IC50 values
of GBK, VP-16 or DDP in MCF-7 cells were 290 μg/
ml, 8.37 μg/ml, and 5 μg/ml, respectively. Notably, the
inhibition of cell proliferation in the GBK+VP-16 group
and the GBK+DDP group was higher than those in the
single drug groups (Tables 4 and 5). Furthermore, GBK
combined with VP-16 or DDP at middle or low doses (<
IC50) showed a synergistic effect (Table 4: lines 2 and 4;
Table 5: lines 2, 4 and 5). Together these data indicate that
when VP-16 or DDP was used in combination with GBK,
the same proliferation inhibition effect could be achieved
with reduced amount of VP-16 or DDP used. These
results demonstrate that GBK is a novel potential clinical
anti-breast cancer drug with mild toxicity and excellent
efficacy in combination regimens.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the potential ability
of the synthetic antihyperlipidemic drug GBK for cancer
treatment. Our results indicate that GBK selectively kills
breast cancer cells through inhibiting the G1-S-phase
transition and inducing apoptosis. These findings support
the further development of GBK for antitumor therapies.

in breast carcinogenesis, such as methylation in the
promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene p53 [33,
34] or the homologous DNA recombination repair
related gene BRCA1 [35, 36], as well as the E-cadherin
promoter DNA methylation-induced loss of E-cadherin
expression in basal-like breast cancer [37]. In addition,
histone lysine methylation has emerged as an important
modification due to its central role in transcriptional
regulation. Loss of H3K4 methylation (trimethylation
of histone H3 at lysine 4) and gain of H3K9 methylation
(dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9) are most closely
related with DNA methylation. DNMT1, DNMT3A,
and DNMT3B all belong to a family of highly related
DNA methyltransferase enzymes that transfer a methyl
group to the cytosine in a CpG dinucleotide, which
commonly occurs in the promoter region of genes [38].
SUV39H1 is a key component of the methyltransferase
responsible for H3K9me3 [39]. We demonstrated
here that the transcription of DNA methyltransferases
DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B and COQ3 genes as well
as the histone methyltransferase DOT1, SUV39H1 and
SUV39H2 were downregulated in GBK-treated MCF-7
cells (Supplementary Figure 3B), indicating that GBK
could inhibit breast cancer progression by reducing
the DNA methylation level in the promoters of tumor
suppressor genes or the global genome. Therefore, future
work will be needed to reveal how these epigenetic
regulations are achieved by GBK treatment.
Over the past decades, there has been growing
interest in developing natural products and their derivatives
as potential therapeutic applications for malignant diseases
[40]. Natural products and their derivatives can also be
used as co-adjuvants of classic chemotherapeutic drugs
to increase their effectiveness [41–43]. In this study, we
demonstrated synergistic cytotoxic effects when GBK
was combined with VP-16 or DDP at middle or low doses
through inhibiting cell proliferation. These results suggest
that the combination of GBK and VP-16/DPP may be a
promising therapeutic option for breast cancer. Further
investigations are needed to test the combination therapy
of GBK along with standard chemotherapeutic agents in
clinical trials.
Alterations of lipid metabolism have been
increasingly regarded as a hallmark of cancer cells, as
the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis and
protein prenylation has been implicated in many aspects of
tumorigenesis. The oncoproteins like Ras family members
(Ras and Rho GTPases) undergo post-translational
isoprenylation for their activity [44]. Antihyperlipidemic
drugs, such as statins, inhibit oncoprotein prenylation
through
isoprenoiding
intermediates
farnesyl
pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP),
which are essential for modification of Ras family members
that bind to FPP and/or GPP through isoprenylation [45].
Thus, reduction in isoprenoids (FPP and GPP) could
inhibit tumor cell proliferation, enhance tumor apoptosis,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibit angiogenesis, migration, and invasion, and impair
metastasis [46]. Accumulating preclinical data suggest
that statins may have chemopreventative potential against
several types of cancer, mostly gastrointestinal tumors,
breast cancer and prostate cancer [47]. The synthetic drug
GBK, which also shows antihyperlipidemic activity, is
an attractive potent therapeutic agent to treat cancer, as
it could be used by large populations to treat non-cancerrelated medical situations. Further preclinical data, such
as the starting time of GBK therapy, duration and dose,
are required to validate the effect of GBK in prevention
and treatment of breast cancer when used as a daily drug.
In summary, we demonstrated that GBK is a
multi-targeting anti-breast cancer compound. The MCF7 cell system is one of the most recognized models for
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer [48]. We
propose a model in which after GBK treatment, MCF-7
cell proliferation is inhibited by G1-S-phase arrest and
JNK signaling pathway is also induced to selectively kill
breast cancer cells (Figure 8). A synergistic antitumor
effect was observed when GBK was used in combination
with classical chemotherapeutic drugs (VP-16 or DDP).
In addition, in vivo studies highlighted the anti-breast
carcinogenesis behavior of GBK. Therefore, our findings
reveal the potential of the synthetic antihyperlipidemic
drug GBK in clinical applications for breast cancer and
offer a novel treatment strategy against metastatic breast
cancer.

Biotechology (Nantong, China).
All other reagents were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified.

Cell viability under GBK treatment was assessed
using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction (Beyotime Biotechology).
Briefly, cells were seeded at 5 × 103/100 μl per well in
96-well culture plates and incubated in complete medium.
After 24 h, culture medium was replaced with fresh
medium containing different concentrations of GBK for
another 48 h, or cells were treated with fresh medium
containing specific concentrations of GBK for 0, 1 d, 3 d
or 5 d. At the indicated time points, 10 μl of CCK-8 was
added to each well and cells were incubated at 37°C for 4
h. Finally, the absorbance was measured for each well at
a wavelength of 450 nm using the Microplate Autoreader
(Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).
Independent experiments were repeated in triplicate.

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates in
triplicate at a density of 1 × 103/well in 2 ml complete
medium. After 24 h, cultures were replaced with fresh
medium containing no GBK as control or the same
medium containing different concentrations of GBK. The
plates were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified
incubator for 14 days and media were replaced every third
day. The colonies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
stained in 0.5% crystal violet solution for 15 min at room
temperature, and washed with distilled water to remove
excess dye. The colony numbers were counted under an
Axio Imager A2 microscope (Zeiss, Dresden, Germany).
Independent experiments were repeated in triplicate.

Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle
Flow cytometric analysis was performed to evaluate
the effects of GBK on cell cycle progression. In brief,
cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates (2 × 105 cells/
well) in complete medium. After 24 h, cells were treated
with different concentrations of GBK in fresh medium
for another 48 h; for time-dependent experiments, cells
were treated with specific concentrations of GBK in fresh
medium for 12, 24 or 48 h. After treatments, cells were
harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with ice-cold
PBS, and then fixed overnight at −20°C in 70% ethanol.
Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 50 μg/
mL propidium iodide and 50 μg/mL RNase A in PBS on
ice for 30 min in the dark. Flow cytometry was performed
using a FACSCalibur system (Becton Dickinson, San Jose,
CA, USA) with CELLQuest software (Version 3.3, Becton
Dickinson) and the cell cycle distributions were calculated
by ModFit LT software (Version 3.0, Verity Software
House, Topsham, ME, USA). Independent experiments
were repeated in triplicate.

Microarray analysis

Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis

Total RNAs were isolated from cells using a Trizol
reagent kit (Transgen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The cDNA was synthesized using TransScript
One-Step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis SuperMix
(Transgen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The cDNA fragmentation, labeling, and
hybridization of labeled cDNAs from cells with
Affymetrix GeneChip® PrimeView™ Human Gene
Expression Array and scanning were performed as
described in the Affymetrix User Guide (http://www.
affymetrix.com). The array includes approximately
530,000 probes covering more than 36,000 transcripts
and variants, which represent more than 20,000 genes
mapped through RefSeq or via UniGene annotation. Data
from three independent experiments were combined to
identify candidate genes upregulated or downregulated in
response to GBK treatment in MCF-7 and SGC-7901 cell
lines (GEO access number GSE87440). Fold change filters
required upregulated genes to be present at levels at least
2-fold of controls and for downregulated genes to be 0.5fold lower than that of controls.

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of
2 × 105 cells/well. After 48 h of GBK treatment at 0,
145, 290, and 580 μg/ml, cells were collected. The cells
were then washed twice with cold PBS, and 1 × 106 cells
were resuspended in 300 μl of 1× binding buffer. Cell
suspension (300 μl) was transferred to a 5 ml culture tube
and incubated with 5 μl of Annexin V antibody together
with 5 μl of PI (Becton Dickinson). Next, 200 μl of 1×
binding buffer was added to each tube and the cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h. Independent
experiments were repeated in triplicate.

Hoechst 33258 staining
At 48 h after GBK (290 or 580 μg/ml) treatment,
cells were fixed, washed twice with PBS, and stained
with Hoechst 33258 staining solution according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were observed and
imaged using a confocal microscope LSM 710 (Zeiss)
with 60× amplification.

Caspase activity assays

Relative quantitative real-time PCR

Caspase-6/9 activity in cell lysates was determined
using Caspase 6 or Caspase 9 activity kit (Beyotime
Biotechology) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The caspase-6/9 activity was normalized by the protein
concentration of the corresponding cell lysate and
expressed as percentage of treated cells to that of control.
Independent experiments were repeated in triplicate.

RNA isolated from each sample was from the
same pool used for microarray analysis. The cDNA was
synthesized using TransScript® One-Step gDNA Removal
and cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (Transgen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 500 ng of total RNA
from cells with or without GBK treatment was used as
template in a 20 μl reaction system. The cDNA expression
levels of selected candidate genes were measured by RTqPCR using the primer pairs listed in Supplementary Table
4. Primers for candidate genes and reference gene were
designed using the Primer Premier 5.0, with calculated Tm
values of 55–62°C and amplification products no longer
than 200 bp. cDNA (2 μl) was used as template in a 25
μl reaction mixture including 10 μmol/L of each primer.
SYBR®Premix ExTaq™ II (TliRNaseH Plus) (TaKaRa,
Dalian, Japan) was used for the RT-qPCR assay, and the
reactions were performed in an Opticon 3 Real-Time PCR
System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA) using the
default cycling conditions (an initial incubation at 95°C for
30 s, and 45 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C
plate read). Melting curves were run immediately after
the last cycle, with the temperature ramping from 65 to
95°C; read every 1.0°C; and held for 10 s at 4°C to exclude
any influence of primer dimers. Cycle numbers at which
the fluorescence passed the cycle threshold (Ct) were
analyzed, and the 2(-ΔΔCt)-method was used to calculate the
relative expression levels. For each trial, nine independent
experiments were performed as three biological replicates
and three technical replicates, and all expression levels
were normalized to reference gene β-actin.

Determination of cellular levels of ROS
Cellular ROS contents were measured by flow
cytometry. In brief, cells were seeded in 6-well culture
plates (2 × 105 cells/well) in complete medium. After
24 h, cells were treated with GBK (290 μg/ml) in fresh
medium for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, or 6 h, or cells were treated with
different concentrations of GBK in fresh medium for 0.5
h. Cells were stained with 10 μM DCFH-DA (Beyotime
Biotechology) at 37°C for 30 min; cells were then collected
and the fluorescence was analyzed using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). In some experiments,
cells were pretreated with 5 mM N-Acetyl-L-cysteine
(NAC) (MilliporeSigma) for 2 h prior to GBK exposure
and analysis of ROS generation and cell apoptosis.

Xenograft tumors in NOD/SCID mice
Four-week-old female NOD/SCID mice, obtained
from Beijing Vital River Experimental Animals
Technology (Beijing, China), were used in all experiments.
One week prior to MCF-7 cell implantation, a small
incision was made on the back of NOD/SCID mice and
a beta-estradiol pellet was embedded. To establish tumors
in mice, early passage MCF-7 cells were harvested and
47265

resuspended in 1:1 mixture of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson)
and PBS. Cells (1 × 107 cells in 100 μl) were then injected
subcutaneously into the right and left flank regions of each
mouse. After 21 days, the tumors reached a mean diameter
of 8 mm in all recipients. Tumor-bearing mice were
randomly divided into control and treated groups (4 mice
as control, and 8 mice as the experiment group). Based
on preliminary experiments, GBK was intraperitoneally
administered at 10 mg/kg body weight per day for 3
weeks in the GBK-treatment group, and the control group
received vehicle only. Body weight and diet consumption
were recorded twice weekly throughout the study. After
the initiation of GBK administration, the tumor size was
measured with an external caliper twice a week and tumor
volume was calculated using the following formula: tumor
volume V=ab2/2, in which “a” represents the long axis and
“b” represents the short axis of the tumor. At the end of
experiment, all the animals were sacrificed and the tumors
were excised, weighed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
embedded in paraffin for additional analyses.

Immunohistochemistry
All tumor tissues were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) and embedded in paraffin.
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (5-μm thick) were
processed and immunohistochemistry was performed.
In brief, sections were deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated in ethanol. Sections were rehydrated and
endogenous enzyme was blocked for 10 min, followed
by 3 min of heat-induced antigen retrieval. Sections were
then incubated with primary antibodies (cyclin E, MCM2,
VEGF, CDC6, or BCL2) at 4°C overnight. On the next
day, after 45 min of incubation with HRP Conjugate
Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody reagent at 37°C,
the signals were detected by adding substrate hydrogen
peroxide using diaminobenzidine as a chromogen
followed by hematoxylin counterstaining. All sections
were examined under a light microscope (Zeiss).
