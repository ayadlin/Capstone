ABSTRACT
Melanoma is a recalcitrant disease. The present study used a patient-derived
orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of melanoma to test sensitivity to three molecularlytargeted drugs and one standard chemotherapeutic. A BRAF-V600E-mutant melanoma
obtained from the right chest wall of a patient was grown orthotopically in the right
chest wall of nude mice to establish a PDOX model. Two weeks after implantation,
50 PDOX nude mice were divided into 5 groups: G1, control without treatment; G2,
vemurafenib (VEM) (30 mg/kg); G3; temozolomide (TEM) (25 mg/kg); G4, trametinib
(TRA) (0.3 mg/kg); and G5, cobimetinib (COB) (5 mg/kg). Each drug was administered
orally, daily for 14 consecutive days. Tumor sizes were measured with calipers twice
a week. On day 14 from initiation of treatment, TRA, an MEK inhibitor, was the only
agent of the 4 tested that caused tumor regression (P < 0.001 at day 14). In contrast,
another MEK inhibitor, COB, could slow but not arrest growth or cause regression of
the melanoma. First-line therapy TEM could slow but not arrest tumor growth or cause
regression. The patient in this study had a BRAF-V600E-mutant melanoma and would
be considered to be a strong candidate for VEM as first-line therapy, since VEM targets
this mutation. However, VEM was not effective. The PDOX model thus helped identify
the very-high efficacy of TRA against the melanoma PDOX and is a promising drug for
this patient. These results demonstrate the powerful precision of the PDOX model for
cancer therapy, not achievable by genomic analysis alone.

INTRODUCTION

had some success with melanoma but is limited by lack
of sufficient tumor infiltration of activated lymphocytes
to kill the cancer cells within the tumor in the majority of
patients tested [3]. Dacarbazine and cisplatinum have been
used to treat melanoma with limited efficacy [4, 5].
Despite progress in melanoma therapy, there is still
no cure for stage III and IV disease due to drug resistance,
tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressed tumor
microenvironment [2]. In addition, the presence of melanin

Melanoma is a recalcitrant cancer. When melanoma
metastasizes to regional lymph nodes, the 5-year survival
rate is 29% and when it metastasizes to organs, the
survival rate is 7% [1]. Although recently-developed
immuno-therapy has extended survival to some extent, the
5-year survival rates have not been significantly increased
[2]. Immuno-therapy involving PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has

p = 0.0171; day 7: p < 0.0001; day 10: p < 0.0001; day 14:
p < 0.0001). On day 14, TRA showed significantly more
efficacy compared to other therapies evaluated: VEM
(p < 0.0001), COB (p = 0.0001), and TEM (p = 0.0001).
The PDOX results suggest that TRA could be used as firstline therapy for this patient (Figure 2).
VEM, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), targeting
BRAF-V600E kinase, has been effective in the treatment
of a BRAF-V600E-mutant melanoma [28–30]. The
patient in the present study had a BRAF-V600E-mutant
melanoma and would have been considered to be a strong
candidate for VEM as first-line therapy. However, not all
melanomas with mutant BRAF-V600E are responsive
to VEM [28]. In the present study, VEM efficacy
was significantly less than TRA (p < 0.0001), TEM
(p = 0.0090) and COB (p = 0.0239), on day 14 (Figure 2).
The histology of the original patient tumor and the
untreated PDOX tumor (Figure 3A, 3B) were similar,
containing the same types of cells. However, nests of
cancer cells are seen in the original, but not in the PDOX.
Also, the original tumor was slightly melanotic, but
the PDOX tumor did not appear to contain melanin. As
mentioned above, high levels of melanin in melanoma
may interfere with therapy [4].
COB is a MEK inhibitor, similar to TRA. It was
reported that combination therapy of VEM and COB
improved progression-free survival (PFS) in melanoma
compared to VEM plus placebo [31]. COB mono-therapy
was significantly more effective than VEM mono-therapy
in our study (p = 0.0239). However, TRA was significantly
more effective than COB (p < 0.0001) as discussed above.
TEM, an alkylating agent, had been widely used as
a standard chemotherapy for melanoma. However, after
approval of molecular-targeting agents, such as VEM, COB,
and TRA, TEM is not usually the first choice for melanoma.

appears to interfere with chemotherapy and radiotherapy
of this recalcitrant disease [4]. Therefore, more effective
approaches to melanoma treatment are needed.
Clinically-relevant mouse models of melanoma
would permit evaluation of tailor-made individualized
therapy based on the patient-derived tumor. Our laboratory
pioneered the patient-derived orthotopic xenograft
(PDOX) nude mouse model with the technique of surgical
orthotopic implantation (SOI) [6]. Our laboratory has
developed PDOX model of various types of tumors
including pancreatic [7–10], breast [11], ovarian [12],
lung [13], cervical [14], colon [15–17], stomach [18] and
sarcoma [19–23]. Recent studies from our laboratory have
demonstrated that PDOX models can be used to develop
fluorescence-guided surgery [8, 17, 24], novel therapeutics
such as tumor-targeting bacteria [21, 22, 25] and study the
tumor microenvironment [26, 27]. The PDOX model,
developed by our laboratory over the past 28 years, has
many advantages over subcutaneous-transplant models
which are growing ectopically under the skin [6].
The results of the present study indicate that
molecular profiling alone may not predict drug response
and that a PDOX model of the patient’s tumor is necessary
for precise individualized therapy.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
All treatments significantly inhibited tumor growth
compared to untreated control on day 14 after initiation:
vemurafenib (VEM): p = 0.0117; temozolomide (TEM),
p < 0.0001; trametinib (TRA), p < 0.0001; and cobimetinib
(COB), p < 0.0001. However, tumor regression was
observed only in the TRA group (Figure 1).
As shown in Figure 2, TRA regressed tumor
growth compared to untreated control from day 3 (day 3:

However, not all melanomas have mutations that are
targeted by these new agents and not all patients with these
mutations are responsive to these drugs [28]. In our PDOX
study, TEM was the most effective agent after TRA and
significantly more effective than VEM (p = 0.0090), despite
the patient having a BRAF-V600E mutation (Figure 2).
TRA is a MEK inhibitor, which has been shown to
act downstream of KRAS, suppressing mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) [32]. TRA was shown to affect
the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) leading
to drug resistance [32]. In a recent study, inhibition of

FGFR1 in combination with TRA enhanced cancer cell
death in vitro and in vivo [32]. The results of the present
report, however, demonstrate that TRA was very active as
a single agent in a BRAF-V600E mutant melanoma, that
is only partially inhibited by VEM [30].
The results of the present study also demonstrate
that drug response testing in the PDOX model can
distinguish efficacy of drugs on individual tumors that
have similar molecular targets. The results of the present
study also indicate that molecular profiling alone may not
predict drug response.

body weight loss, difficulty breathing, rotational motion
and body temperature drop. Animals were housed in a
barrier facility on a high-efficacy particulate arrestance
(HEPA)- filtered rack under standard conditions of
12-hour light/dark cycles. The animals were fed an
autoclaved laboratory rodent diet. All animal studies
were conducted in accordance with the principles and
procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Animals under Assurance
Number A3873-1.

CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, the PDOX model helped
identify the very high efficacy of TRA against the
melanoma PDOX. TRA, a targeted MEK inhibitor, was
the only agent of the 4 tested that caused tumor regression
and is a promising drug for the patient donor of the
PDOX. COB is also a targeted MEK inhibitor, but was
only partially effective against the melanoma PDOX.
VEM would have been predicted to be active against this
tumor [30], which has a BRAF- V600E-mutation which
VEM targets, but VEM was not effective. These results
demonstrate the powerful precision of the PDOX model,
not achievable by genomic analysis alone. TRA is a MEK
inhibitor that also acts synergistically with agents that
target the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1) such
as ponatinib (PON) [32]. Future experiments will test the
combination of TRA and PON in melanoma and other
PDOX models. Future experiments will also compare the
molecular action of TRA and COB to determine why they
had a strong difference in efficacy in the present case.
Previously developed concepts and strategies of
highly selective tumor targeting can take advantage of
molecular targeting of tumors, including tissue-selective
therapy which focuses on unique differences between
normal and tumor tissues [33–38].
We recently reported that a PDOX model from
another melanoma patient responded very well to tomurtargeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R [39]. Future
experiments will test the present and other melanoma
PDOX with Salmonella typhimurium A1-R.

Patient-derived tumor
A 75-year-old female patient was diagnosed with a
melanoma of the right chest wall. The tumor was resected
in the Department of Surgery, University of California,
Los Angeles (UCLA). Written informed consent was
provided by the patient, and the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) of UCLA approved this experiment.

Establishment of PDOX models of melanoma by
surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI)
A fresh sample of the melanoma of the patient was
obtained and transported immediately to the laboratory
at AntiCancer, Inc., on wet ice. The sample was cut into
5-mm fragments and implanted subcutaneously in nude
mice. After three weeks, the subcutaneously-implanted
tumors grew to more than 10 mm in diameter. The
subcutaneously-grown tumors were then harvested and
cut into small fragments (3 mm3). After nude mice were
anesthetized with the ketamine solution described above,
a 5-mm skin incision was made on the right chest into
the chest wall, which was split to make space for the
melanoma tissue fragment. A single tumor fragment was
implanted orthotopically into the space to establish the
PDOX model. The wound was closed with a 6–0 nylon
suture (Ethilon, Ethicon, Inc., NJ, USA) [23, 24].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice

Treatment study design in the PDOX model of
melanoma

Athymic nu/nu nude mice (AntiCancer Inc., San
Diego, CA), 4–6 weeks old, were used in this study. All
mouse surgical procedures and imaging were performed
with the animals anesthetized by subcutaneous injection
of a ketamine mixture (0.02 ml solution of 20 mg/kg
ketamine, 15.2 mg/kg xylazine, and 0.48 mg/kg
acepromazine maleate). The response of animals during
surgery was monitored to ensure adequate depth of
anesthesia. The animals were observed on a daily basis
and humanely sacrificed by CO2 inhalation if they met the
following humane endpoint criteria: severe tumor burden
(more than 20 mm in diameter), prostration, significant

PDOX mouse models were randomized into five
groups of 10 mice each: G1, untreated control (n = 10);
G2, treated with VEM (30 mg/kg, n = 10); G3, TEM
(25 mg/kg, n = 10); G4, TRA (0.3 mg/kg, n = 10); G5,
COB (5 mg/kg, n = 10) [1]. Each drug was administrated
orally daily for 14 consecutive days. Tumor length and
width were measured twice a week. Tumor volume was
calculated with the following formula: Tumor volume
(mm3) = length (mm) × width (mm) × width (mm) × 1/2.
Data are presented as mean ± SD. The tumor volume ratio
is defined at the tumor volume at any given time point
relative to the initial tumor volume.

Tumor histology
Tumor tissue was removed along with surrounding
normal tissues at the time of resection from the patient
and untreated control PDOX. The tissues were fixed in
10% formalin and embedded in paraffin before sectioning
and staining. Tissue sections (3 μm) were deparaffinized
in xylene and rehydrated in an ethanol series. Hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining was performed according
to standard protocols. Histological examination was
performed with a BHS system microscope. Images were
acquired with INFINITY ANALYZE software (Lumenera
Corporation, Ottawa, Canada).
