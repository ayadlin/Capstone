BACKGROUND: A new predictive biomarker for determining prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who receive
sorafenib is required, because achieving a reduction in tumor size with sorafenib is rare, even in patients who have a favorable prognosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor is a sorafenib target. In the current study, the authors examined changes in
plasma VEGF concentrations during sorafenib treatment and determined the clinical significance of VEGF as a prognostic indicator in
patients with HCC. METHODS: Plasma VEGF concentrations were serially measured in 63 patients with advanced HCC before and
during sorafenib treatment. A plasma VEGF concentration that decreased >5% from the pretreatment level at 8 weeks was defined
as a “VEGF decrease.” An objective tumor response was determined using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1
month after the initiation of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. RESULTS: Patients who had a VEGF decrease at week 8 (n 5 14)
had a longer median survival than those who did not have a VEGF decrease (n 5 49; 30.9 months vs 14.4 months; P 5.038). All
patients who had a VEGF decrease survived for >6 months, and the patients who had both a VEGF decrease and an a-fetoprotein
response (n 5 6) survived during the observation period (median, 19.7 months; range, 6.5-31.0 months). In univariate analyses, a VEGF
decrease, radiologic findings classified as progressive disease, and major vascular invasion were associated significantly with 1-year
survival; and, in multivariate analysis, a VEGF decrease was identified as an independent factor associated significantly with survival.
CONCLUSIONS: A plasma VEGF concentration decrease at 8 weeks after starting sorafenib treatment may predict favorable overall

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver (70%-85%) and a major cause of
mortality. It is the fifth and seventh most frequent cancer and the second and sixth most frequent cause of cancer death in
men and women, respectively.1 At early stages or at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A, a 5-year survival rate of 60% to
70% can be achieved in well selected patients with HCC who undergo surgical therapies (liver resection or transplantation) or locoregional procedures (ie, radiofrequency ablation).2 However, treatment of advanced HCC that is not amenable to surgical or locoregional therapies remains a challenge in clinical practice.
Sorafenib is an oral, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the synthesis of several intracellular proteins
considered to be important for tumor progression, including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, raf kinase,
and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor. VEGF is a homodimetric glycoprotein with a molecular
weight of 45 kDa. The VEGF family includes VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and a structurally related molecule: placental growth factor. Three high-affinity VEGF tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGFRs) have been identified:

VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3. VEGFR-2 is the
principal receptor that promotes the proangiogenic action
of VEGF-A and has been the principal target of antiangiogenic therapies, although additional studies have underlined the importance of signaling through VEGFR-1. In 2
phase 3, placebo-controlled, randomized trials, sorafenib
treatment significantly improved the time to tumor progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) of patients with
advanced HCC.3,4 In those trials, however, no statistically
significant pretreatment factors that predicted responses
after patients started receiving sorafenib were identified.5
Therefore, in clinical practice, it is extremely important to
identify a predictive post-treatment biomarker that is
associated with the treatment efficacy of sorafenib and the
prognosis of patients after they start receiving sorafenib.
In general, the efficacy of treating solid tumors with
systemic chemotherapy agents is assessed by radiologic
findings. In 2010, Lencioni and Llovet published a modification of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST).6 However, the modified RECIST
can be used only for typical HCC. Advanced HCCs often
have atypical vascular patterns; therefore, evaluating tumor response to sorafenib is difficult with radiologic findings alone. Alternatively, a-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most
popular tumor marker for HCC, and it has been reported
that early AFP responses are a useful surrogate marker for
predicting treatment response and prognosis in patients
with advanced HCC who receive cytotoxic and antiangiogenic agents.7-9 However, approximately 30% of patients
with advanced HCC in the Sorafenib HCC Assessment
Randomized Protocol (SHARP) trial had normal AFP
concentrations.10 Therefore, the identification of a new
biomarker that can complementarily predict the efficacy
of sorafenib and the prognosis of patients is necessary.
In a mouse model, an increase in hepatic VEGF levels
was observed at 24 hours, 72 hours, and 120 hours after the
administration of sorafenib,11 suggesting that a change in
VEGF levels may also occur during sorafenib therapy in
humans. Therefore, we evaluated plasma VEGF changes
during sorafenib treatment in patients with advanced HCC
to determine whether VEGF has potential as a new biomarker for the prediction of treatment efficacy and prognosis after sorafenib administration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

Between December 2009 and August 2012, 95 consecutive patients with advanced, inoperable HCC received
treatment with sorafenib at Musashino Red Cross
Hospital. The diagnosis of HCC was based on guidelines
230

established by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan12
and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases13 or by pathologic examination. According to these
guidelines, a diagnosis of HCC is confirmed by histology
or by characteristic radiologic findings, such as typical arterial enhancement of the tumor followed by a washout
pattern in the images in the portal venous phase or the
equilibrium phase on dynamic spiral computed tomography (CT) imaging or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Inclusion criteria were predefined as
follows: 1) patients were alive 8 weeks after beginning
treatment; and 2) patients had plasma VEGF and serum
AFP concentrations evaluated at baseline, at 4 weeks, and
at 8 weeks. Of 95 patients, 23 were unavailable for a
week-8 VEGF measurement for the following reasons: 7
patients stopped sorafenib therapy because of erythema
multiforme (grade 2-3) and started other therapies (radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy) within 1 month
after starting sorafenib, 4 patients moved to another location before week 8, 5 patients refused to undergo a plasma
VEGF measurement at week 8, and 7 patients were not
available for obtaining VEGF concentration results.
These 23 patients and 9 other patients who died within 8
weeks were excluded from the study. Hence, in total, 63
patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. At enrollment, all
patients had metastatic or locally advanced HCC that was
not amenable to surgery or locoregional therapies, including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and
local ablation. Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients, and the ethics committee at Musashino
Red Cross Hospital approved the study in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Sorafenib Treatment

The initial daily dose of sorafenib was 800 mg in 28
patients, 400 mg in 28 patients, and 200 mg in 7 patients.
A reduced initial dose was allowed for patients who had the
following factors: advanced age (80 years), gastrointestinal varices with a risk of bleeding, low body weight (<50
kg), and a poor performance status (2). In total, 60
patients underwent multiphase-multidetector CT imaging
before starting sorafenib, 1 month after starting sorafenib,
and every 3 months thereafter. Radiologic responses to
therapy were evaluated according to modified RECIST. In
all patients, serial measurements of plasma VEGF and serum AFP concentrations were performed before and after
the receipt sorafenib and every month thereafter, with an
allowance of 6 1 week. The endpoint of the current study
was OS. In the follow-up visit after sorafenib administration, the medication was discontinued if progressive disease

(PD) was identified despite treatment, if intolerable adverse
events occurred, or if inappropriate liver function was
observed. Other palliative treatments or best supportive
care were provided subsequently. An AFP response was
defined as a decrease 20% in the serum AFP concentration during 8 weeks of treatment.
Plasma VEGF Measurements

Serial serum samples were collected prospectively from
each patient. Venous blood samples were drawn into a
serum separator tube and centrifuged at 31800g for
10 minutes, and plasma samples were stored at 280 C
until measurement. Plasma VEGF concentrations were
measured quantitatively using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Quantikine Human VEGF Immunoassay; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. We defined a decrease in
the plasma VEGF level >5% from the pretreatment level
at 8 weeks as a “VEGF decrease.”
Statistical Analysis

Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square
test, and continuous variables were compared using the
Mann-Whitney test. All tests of significance were 2-tailed,
and P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. OS curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and differences between groups were assessed
using the log-rank test. OS was determined as the interval
between the date of treatment initiation and either death
or the last visit. A Cox proportional-hazards model was
used to determine the factors associated with OS. In univariate analyses, clinical and biologic parameters (sex, age,
etiology, albumin, bilirubin concentrations, Child-Pugh
class, plasma VEGF concentrations, and serum AFP concentrations) and tumor factors (vascular invasion and distant metastasis) were included. A logistic regression model
was used to identify the factors associated with 1-year survival after the receipt of sorafenib. All statistical analyses
were performed using StatView (version 5.0) software
(Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, Calif).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

In total, 63 patients were enrolled in this study, and their
characteristics are listed in Table 1. The diagnosis of
HCC was confirmed by histology in 11 patients and by
typical radiologic findings based on established guidelines
in the remaining 52 patients. In all, 51 patients had previously received other therapeutic modalities, including 22
patients who previously received radiofrequency ablation,

22 who previously underwent TACE, 1 who previously
received transcatheter arterial chemoinfusion, and 6 who
previously underwent hepatic resection. Twelve patients
had received sorafenib as initial therapy for HCC. Among
the 63 enrolled patients, 33 were seropositive for hepatitis
C virus antibody, 8 were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen, and 22 were seronegative for both hepatitis
C virus antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen. Eighteen
patients had evidence of extrahepatic metastasis, and 18
had major vascular invasion. No patient was lost to
follow-up in this study.
Pretreatment Plasma VEGF Concentration and
Prognosis and Extent of Hepatocellular
Carcinoma

Pretreatment plasma VEGF concentrations in the 9
patients who died within 8 weeks were significantly higher
than in the patients who survived beyond 8 weeks
(813 6 630 pg/mL vs 384 6 18 pg/mL; P 5 .0024).
Consistent with a previous study (the SHARP trial; Llovet
et al3), our data suggested that the pretreatment plasma
VEGF concentration is a useful prognostic factor for sorafenib therapy. However, there was no significant difference in OS between patients who had pretreatment
plasma VEGF concentrations 450 pg/mL (n 5 46) and
those who had concentrations >450 pg/mL (n 5 17;
P 5 .731). The pretreatment plasma VEGF concentration
could not predict prognosis for the patients who survived
beyond 8 weeks.
We compared the size and extent of HCC between
patients who had low plasma VEGF concentrations
(450 pg/mL) and high plasma VEGF concentrations
(>450 pg/mL). No difference was observed in the size or
extent of HCC at baseline between patients with lower
versus higher pretreatment plasma VEGF concentrations.
Association Between Changes in Plasma VEGF
Concentrations and Overall Survival

was 16.3 months for all 63 patients enrolled in the study

VEGF concentration 8 weeks after starting sorafenib
treatment is closely associated with a favorable prognosis.
The median percentage of decrease in the plasma VEGF
concentration was 18.3% (range, 7%-41.7%). There were
no differences in any pretreatment patient characteristics,
including HCC stage and Child-Pugh score, between
patients who did and did not have a VEGF decrease
(Table 2).

Survival

(Fig. 1). Plasma VEGF concentrations at baseline, at 4
weeks, and at 8 weeks after the initiation of sorafenib
treatment were 288 pg/mL (range, 60-1580 pg/mL), 372
pg/mL (range, 69-1990 pg/mL), and 347 pg/mL (range,
64-1840 pg/mL), respectively (Fig. 2). Plasma VEGF
concentrations increased within 4 weeks after the administration of sorafenib in 47 of 63 patients (74.6%). The
median survival of patients who had a decrease in their
plasma VEGF concentration at week 4 (n 5 16) and an
increase in their plasma VEGF concentration at week 4
(n 5 47) were 19.5 months and 16.8 months, respectively; and there was no significant difference in OS
between changes in plasma VEGF at 4 weeks (P 5 .645).
However, patients who had a VEGF decrease at week 8
(n 5 14) had a longer median survival than those who did
not have a VEGF decrease (n 5 49; 30.9 months vs 14.4

The best radiologic responses to therapy assessed by modified RECIST were classified as a complete response (CR)
(n 5 4), a partial response (PR) (n 5 16), stable disease
(SD) (n 5 34), and PD (n 5 9). Fourteen patients had a
VEGF decrease, and their best radiologic responses were a
CR (n 5 2), a PR (n 5 2), SD (n 5 9), and PD (n 5 1).
There was no significant difference in OS between the
patients who had an objective response (CR 1 PR) and
those with SD. The survival of patients who had PD was
significantly worse than that of the patients without PD
(median OS, 5.8 months and 19.4 months, respectively;
P 5 .0006). There was no significant difference in OS
between patients who had an AFP response and those
who did not have an AFP response within the group that
did not have PD (ie, those who attained a CR, a PR, or
SD [the non-PD group]) (Fig. 4). There also was no significant difference (P 5 .111) between patients who did
and did not have an AFP response among those in the
non-PD group who had had an elevated AFP at baseline.

It is noteworthy that all patients who had a VEGF
decrease and an AFP response survived during the observation period (median, 19.7 months; range, 6.5-31.0
months). In patients without a VEGF response (n 5 49),
there was no significant difference in OS between those
who did and did not have an AFP response (P 5 .147). Of
49 patients who did not have a VEGF decrease at 8 weeks,
19 patients were able to survive beyond 1 year after starting sorafenib. Nine patients without a VEGF decrease at
8 weeks survived for >18 months.

OS after starting sorafenib. Major vascular invasion and
PD, as evidenced by radiologic findings after sorafenib
administration, also were significant prognostic factors.
To predict which patients would have a highly favorable
prognosis, the prognostic factors associated with 1-year
survival after starting sorafenib were assessed in univariate
and multivariate analyses. In the univariate analysis, a
VEGF decrease, PD, and major vascular invasion were
associated significantly with survival (Table 3). In the
multivariate analysis, which was performed using those
factors as covariates, a VEGF decrease was identified as an
independent factor associated significantly with survival
(Table 3). There was a significant difference in OS among
the 3 groups (patients with a VEGF decrease and nonPD, patients without a VEGF decrease but non-PD, and
patients without a VEGF decrease and PD; P 5 .0013)
(Fig. 5). Only 1 patient who had a VEGF decrease was
classified with PD. All 4 patients who had a VEGF
decrease and an objective response (CR or PR) were able
to survive during the observation period.
Adverse Events During Sorafenib Treatment

The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events
was 100%. The rate of discontinuation of sorafenib as a
result of adverse events was 22.2%. Adverse events that
led to the discontinuation of sorafenib treatment were
liver dysfunction (63.6%), hand-foot skin reaction
(18.2%), interstitial pneumonia (9.1%), and rash (9.1%).
Dose reductions because of adverse events occurred in 62
patients. The most frequent adverse event leading to dose
reductions was liver dysfunction (33.9%). In addition,

therapy, and changes in VEGF concentration are closely
associated with OS in patients who receive treatment with
sorafenib. VEGF is the major mediator of angiogenesis in
HCC, and several studies have correlated VEGF concentrations with the prognosis of patients who have advanced
HCC.5,14-21
Recently, a new staging system was proposed that
includes the plasma VEGF concentration along with the
Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score; this
new system—known as the V-CLIP score—classifies
patients with advanced HCC more appropriately into a
homogeneous prognostic group.22 Therefore, the concentration of circulating VEGF is included as a candidate
prognostic marker for HCC, especially in patients with
advanced disease. The objective of our study was to elucidate the important question of whether an on-treatment
change in VEGF is a potentially useful new biomarker for
predicting prognosis in patients who survive beyond 8
weeks, because such an on-treatment predictor among
patients who have relatively longer survival has not yet
been elucidated. In this study, plasma VEGF concentrations increased from pretreatment levels within 4 weeks of
starting sorafenib in 47 of 63 patients (74.6%). This was
followed by a decrease in plasma VEGF levels at 8 weeks
in 68.1% of patients. A possible mechanism of this transient increase in VEGF after starting sorafenib may be
related to a reactive increase against the inhibition of
VEGF activity or hypoxia induced by sorafenib. This
Cancer

hypothesis is supported by the demonstration that plasma
VEGF concentrations increased shortly after treatment
with TACE.24-26 It is believed that these increases in
plasma VEGF concentration are related to the induction
of tissue hypoxia.27 However, the peak time point of
VEGF elevation during sorafenib administration was different from that previously reported in TACE, in which a
transient elevation of VEGF was observed within 7 days
after TACE.24-26 This observed difference may be related
to the continuous induction of hypoxia by sorafenib
administration.
It is noteworthy that, in our study, decreases in
plasma VEGF observed within 8 weeks of sorafenib
administration were associated with better OS. One possible reason for this association may be that the decrease in
VEGF concentrations reflects a decrease in the number of
tumor cells secreting VEGF. An association between
changes in VEGF concentrations and disease progression
was observed in a previous study of an anti-VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, in patients with advanced HCC.23 In
that study, plasma VEGF-A concentrations decreased
from baseline in all patients after 8 weeks of bevacizumab
therapy and increased to near baseline levels in 5 of 6
patients at the time of disease progression. Unfortunately,
plasma VEGF-A levels after 8 weeks of bevacizumab in
that study were available for only 8 of 46 patients who
were enrolled the study, and plasma VEGF-A levels after
4 weeks were not evaluated. In our study, all patients were
evaluated before and every 4 weeks after starting sorafenib.
Moreover, we demonstrated the usefulness of plasma
VEGF concentrations at 8 weeks and not at 4 weeks. Zhu
et al28 reported that plasma levels of VEGF and placental
growth factor increased after cediranib, a pan-VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy for advanced HCC.
In that study, progression-free survival was correlated
inversely with baseline levels of VEGF, soluble VEGFR2
(sVEGFR2), and basic fibroblast growth factor and with
on-treatment levels of basic fibroblast growth factor and
insulin-like growth factor-1; and progression-free survival
was directly associated with on-treatment levels of
interferon-g. Because changes of VEGF concentrations
during therapy were not identified as a prognostic factor
in the study by Zhu et al, biomarkers that predict prognosis may be different among different types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Jayson et al29 reported that plasma
VEGF-A in patients who received bevacizumab was
potentially predictive and prognostic in metastatic breast,
gastric, and pancreatic cancers; however, it was only prognostic (and not predictive) in metastatic colorectal cancer,
nonsmall cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. In

our study, we measured plasma VEGF concentrations
and not plasma VEGF-A concentrations. Sorafenib is a
multikinase inhibitor, whereas bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes and blocks
VEGF-A expression. Further studies to evaluate the clinical usefulness of determining VEGF and VEGF-A concentrations during sorafenib therapy are necessary in
various cancers. Although the precise mechanism underlying the association between serial changes in VEGF and
disease progression is unclear, the findings of the current
study are extremely valuable for clinical practice in predicting the prognosis of patients who receive treatment
with sorafenib.
Llovet et al5 studied plasma biomarkers as predictors
of outcome in patients with advanced HCC. They measured plasma biomarkers in 491 patients at baseline and in
305 patients after 12 weeks in a phase 3, randomized, controlled trial (the SHARP trial). Those authors concluded
that angiopoietin-2 and VEGF were independent predictors of survival in patients with advanced HCC and that
none of the tested biomarkers significantly predicted
response to sorafenib. In our study, by measuring plasma
VEGF monthly, we demonstrated that the changes 8
weeks after starting sorafenib were important for predicting OS.
It has been reported that modified RECIST guidelines are useful for predicting efficacy and prognosis after
patients with advanced HCC receive treatment with sorafenib.30 However, modified RECIST can only be used for
typical hypervascular HCC, and not for atypical HCC,
including poorly differentiated HCC and diffuse-type
HCC. Moreover, the percentage of patients in our study
who had PD was only 11.1% (9 of 63 patients), and the
objective response rate (CR 1 PR vs SD) could not predict OS, suggesting that using only modified RECIST
guidelines was insufficient for predicting OS in most
patients who received sorafenib (non-PD patients).
Therefore, it is important to identify a predictive biomarker for those patients who can expect long survival
during sorafenib therapy, although their radiologic findings may not be categorized as objective responses.
From this point of view, decreases in VEGF
observed in non-PD patients at week 8 may identify
patients who have a favorable prognosis. According to our
results, the median survival of patients who had a VEGF
decrease was extremely good at 31.0 months, and we demonstrated that a VEGF decrease, but not modified
RECIST or AFP, was the only significant posttherapeutic factor associated with favorable survival after
sorafenib administration (Table 3). In our study, all
235

patients who had both a VEGF decrease and an AFP
response survived during the observation period (median,
19.7 months). Taken together, the combination of a
plasma VEGF decrease, an AFP response, and modified
RECIST is useful for predicting an extremely favorable
prognosis.
This study had a few limitations. The first was our
subanalysis of consecutive patients. However, the median
survival for the 23 excluded patients who were available
for estimation was equivalent to that of the included
patients (16.8 months); therefore, it is unlikely that selection bias affected our results. The second limitation is that
we measured only plasma VEGF concentrations. In previous studies, many factors, including VEGF-A, short
VEGF-A isoform, sVEGFR1, sVEGFR2, sVEGFR3,
angiopoietin-2, and insulin-like growth factor-2, were
evaluated as biomarkers. However, to our knowledge, this
is the first clinical study to demonstrate the early dynamic
changes in plasma VEGF concentrations in patients who
received sorafenib. Finally, the number of patients in this
study was relatively small to make recommendations to
physicians. Our results indicated that patients who have
decreased VEGF concentrations at 8 weeks have a favorable prognosis, regardless of their radiologic findings.
However, further studies with a larger number of patients
will be necessary to propose new recommendations.
In conclusion, changes in plasma VEGF concentrations during sorafenib treatment are dynamic in patients
with advanced HCC, and an observed decrease in the
plasma VEGF concentration 8 weeks after starting sorafenib is associated significantly with favorable OS. Today,
because many clinical trials of new molecular-targeted
agents for HCC are being conducted, it is necessary for
hepatologists and oncologists to determine the time when
alternative agents should be started as a second or third
line of treatment. Our results have potentially important
clinical implications for physicians and may influence
their decisions regarding a treatment strategy for advanced
HCC in individual patients.
