ABSTRACT
Therapeutic management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(GEP-NETs) is challenging. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor
everolimus recently obtained approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the
treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). Despite
its promising antitumor efficacy observed in cell lines, clinical benefit for patients is
unsatisfactory. The limited therapeutic potential of everolimus in cancer cells has been
attributed to Akt activation due to feedback loops relief following mTOR inhibition.
Combined inhibition of Akt might then improve everolimus antitumoral effect. In this
regard, the somatostatin analog (SSA) octreotide has been shown to repress the PI3K/
Akt pathway in some tumor cell lines. Moreover, SSAs are well tolerated and routinely
used to reduce symptoms caused by peptide release in patients carrying functional
GEP-NETs. We have recently established and characterized primary cultures of human
pNETs and demonstrated the anti-proliferative effects of both octreotide and pasireotide.
In this study, we aim at determining the antitumor efficacy of everolimus alone or in
combination with the SSAs octreotide and pasireotide in primary cultures of pNETs.
Everolimus reduced both Chromogranin A secretion and cell viability and upregulated
Akt activity in single treatment. Its anti-proliferative and anti-secretory efficacy was not
improved combined with the SSAs. Both SSAs did not overcome everolimus-induced Akt
upregulation. Furthermore, caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by SSAs was lost in
combined treatments. These molecular events provide the first evidence supporting the
lack of marked benefit in patients co-treated with everolimus and SSA.

INTRODUCTION

antitumor activity of everolimus observed in clinical
trials may be due to feedback mechanisms favoring prosurvival signals. The loss of S6kinase-dependent negative
feedback loop, involving expression of the insulin receptor
substrate 1 (IRS-1), leading to the activation of PI3K/Akt
and Ras/MAPKinase has been observed in breast cancer
cell lines and human breast and colorectal carcinomas
after everolimus treatment [15, 16]. Therefore, combined
treatments with drugs targeting PI3K/Akt could improve
the anti-proliferative effect of everolimus. In this regard,
activation of SST2 has been shown to repress PI3K
activity by disrupting the interaction between SST2 and
the p85 PI3K regulatory subunit in pituitary and pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cell lines [17, 18]. Clinical benefits of
combined everolimus with octreotide have been evaluated
in pNETs in a phase II trial. Concomitant treatment of
everolimus and octreotide increased PFS in comparison
with everolimus alone, however objective response rate
was lesser in combined treatment [19].
We have recently established and characterized
primary cultures of human pNETs and demonstrated the
anti-proliferative effects of both octreotide and pasireotide
[20]. To assess the relevance of everolimus and cotreatments in pNETs, we have used this suitable state-ofthe-art preclinical model to evaluate the anti-proliferative
and anti-secretory effects of everolimus in single treatment
or in combination with the SSAs octreotide and pasireotide
from 25 well characterized tumors. The role of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR and the MAPKinase ERK1/2 signaling pathways
under these treatments has also been monitored.

Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine
tumors (NETs) is a rare and heterogeneous group of
tumors, with recent increased incidence and prevalence
[1]. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) constitute
a distinct subset of GEP-NETs which behave and respond
to systemic treatments differently to other GEP-NETs (see
[2] for a review). The majority of pNETs are sporadic but
some are associated with inherited genetic syndromes such
as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome (MEN1)
and tuberus sclerosis. They are classified as functional (1030%) or non functional (50-80%), based on their specific
pancreatic hormone hypersecretion [3]. Treatment options
range from curative surgery for localized resectable
disease to palliation with medical therapies including
somatostatin analogs (SSAs), chemotherapy and targeted
treatments for advanced and metastatic pNETs [4]. The
SSAs octreotide and lanreotide are currently used to reduce
symptoms caused by peptides release in a majority of
patients carrying functional GEP-NETs [5]. These effects
have been credited to their binding to the somatostatin
receptor subtype 2 (SST2). SSAs anti-proliferative role has
been investigated in PROMID and CLARINET studies.
Both long acting octreotide and lanreotide significantly
prolonged progression free survival (PFS) respectively in
patients with well-differentiated metastatic midguts GEPNETs and metastatic pNETs [6, 7].
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway integrates growth
factor signals and plays a central role in regulating
multiple cellular processes such as cell growth, survival
and protein synthesis. Several studies have suggested the
involvement of this pathway in pNET tumorigenesis and
progression. Whole exome sequencing of pNETs identified
inactivating mutations of two major negative regulators
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, the phosphatase and
tensin homolog (PTEN) and the tuberous sclerosis 2
(TSC2), in 14% of tumors [8]. Moreover, Missiaglia et
al. have shown that PTEN and TSC2 downregulation
was associated with shorter PFS and overall survival of
pNETs patients [9]. On the contrary, activated levels of
Akt and mTOR have been observed in a subset of pNETs
but without significant correlation with clinicopathological
features [10–12]. Overall, these clues have given the
rational for the use of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of
pNETs. Everolimus, a mTORC1 inhibitor, induces antiproliferative effects in the pNET cell line BON [13]. In
the phase III RADIANT 3 trial, everolimus significantly
prolonged PFS in patients with progressive advanced
pNETs compared with placebo [14]. Thus everolimus
obtained approval from the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for
the treatment of patients with advanced pNETs and more
recently, for NETs of gastrointestinal or lung origin.
However, disease stabilization is observed rather than
objective response, which remains low (<5%). The modest

RESULTS
Molecular characteristics of pNET tissues and
pNET primary cultures
Mutations of MEN1, DAXX/ATRX, PTEN or
down regulation of their respective proteins have been
frequently observed in pNETs ([8, 9]. Loss of DAXX/
ATRX expression has recently been associated with
poor prognosis and might be used to refine prognostic
classification [21]. PTEN mutations have been associated
with rapamycin sensitivity in different cell lines [22].
In this context, to better characterize patients’ tumors,
we searched for MEN1 mutations from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue sections (FFPE) (Table 1).
PTEN, DAXX and ATRX expression was performed by
using immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Table 1). MEN1
mutations were frequently observed in 68% of the tumors
(17/25). PTEN was always found expressed but with
varying levels. Low PTEN expression was observed in
28% of the tumors (7/25). ATRX or DAXX expression
was lost in 29% of the tumors (7/24). A similar frequency
has been obtained by Singhi et al. in a large series of
pNETs [21]. We did not observe any correlation between
PTEN, MEN1 and DAXX/ATRX alterations (not shown),

lost in 3 out of the 4 grade 3 tumors present in our series
(Table 1).
We have previously shown that pNET cells
in primary culture maintained their neuroendocrine
characteristics. In particular, the majority of cells
expressed chromogranin A (CgA) and the SST2 receptor.
Moreover we observed that their capacity to secrete CgA
was regulated by SSAs [20]. Thus we determined the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

level of SST2 mRNA expression, CgA secretion and its
sensitivity to octreotide in the primary cultures of our
series (Table 2). We detected SST2 mRNA expression in
all the primary culture analyzed. As previously observed
SST2 expression level was higher than the other SST
subtypes (not shown). We detected CgA secretion in
all investigated primary cultures with variable levels.
Moreover, except in one primary culture (tumor 2), CgA
secretion was significantly decreased by 1nM octreotide
(Table 2).

patients with 5-10mg per day [23, 24]. Everolimus
decreased viable cell number from 14 % to 77 % of
control value in 20 primary cultures (Figure 1B) with a
median value of 59.3% (Figure 1C). Cell viability was not
significantly altered in 2 primary cultures (90 ± 12% of
control value; Figure 1B). No correlation was observed
between cell viability inhibition by everolimus and the
WHO grade or Ki67 index of the initial tumor (R=-0.207,
p= 0.355; R=- 0.122, p=0.590 respectively). However, cell

viability of 3 pNETs primary cultures. Everolimus
significantly reduced viable cell number at both 1 and

We then tested the effect of 1nM everolimus during 72h,
in the primary cultures from 22 pNETs. This concentration

and the presence of MEN1 tumor mutations or PTEN,

between SSAs-induced cell viability inhibition and the
presence of MEN1 tumor mutations or PTEN, DAXX/
ATRX expression levels.
Cells from the different pNETs did not respond
similarly to combined treatments of 1nM everolimus with
either 1nM octreotide or 1nM pasireotide. Everolimusinduced inhibition of cell viability was increased in only
one primary culture (from a grade 2 tumor with Ki67=3%;
tumor n°8) under combined treatments (Figure 3A).
Two types of response were observed for the other 18
primary cultures. Cell viability was significantly inhibited
whatever the treatment in 9 primary cultures, without
significant difference between the different treatments,
even in combination (Figure 3B). These primary cultures
were from 2 grade 1 and 7 grade 2 tumors, with Ki67≥5%
in 6 tumors. Cell viability was also significantly inhibited
by single treatments in the remaining 9 primary cultures
with a significantly higher sensitivity to everolimus than
SSAs (p=0.02 and p=0.004 respectively for octreotide
and pasireotide). Surprisingly, combined treatments of
1nM everolimus with either 1nM octreotide or 1nM
pasireotide, in these primary cultures, partially or fully
reversed inhibition of cell viability induced by each single
treatment (Figure 3C). Moreover, primary cultures of this
group (Figure 3C) are significantly more responsive to
everolimus than primary cultures responding similarly
to each treatment (Figure 3B) (p< 0.02). These primary
cultures were from 3 grade 1, 4 grade 2 and 2 grade
3 tumors with Ki67≥5% in 5 tumors. There was no
significant difference between the two type of response
to combined treatments with respect to the grade or Ki67
index of the initial tumor (p=0.999, p=0.746 respectively).
To elucidate the observed effects of everolimus
alone or in combined treatment with the SSAs on cell
viability, we determined the activation level of the
executioner caspases 3/7. Basal caspase activities were
not modified with 1nM everolimus treatment during
24h whereas both 1nM octreotide and 1nM pasireotide
significantly increased caspase activities as previously
observed associated to an increase in the number of
TUNEL positive cells ([20], Figure 3D). Caspase
activities were not significantly triggered by combined
treatments of 1nM everolimus with either 1nM octreotide
or with 1nM pasireotide (Figure 3D). This suggests that
everolimus repressed the activity of caspases induced by
SSAs in single treatments. Caspase activities have been
determined in 6 primary cultures. Five of them belong to
primary cultures described in Figure 3C and one in Figure
3B without difference in the response.

Effects of everolimus on CgA secretion
In the same 3 pNETs primary cultures described
above, everolimus significantly decreased CgA secretion
with the same efficacy regardless the concentration (Figure
2A). Among the 19 primary cultures analyzed, 1nM
everolimus reduced CgA secretion from 13 % to 61 % of
the control value in 12 primary cultures of pNETs with a
median value of 43.3% (Figure 2B, 2C). CgA secretion
was not significantly modified under 1nM everolimus
treatment in the primary cultures from 7 tumors (median
value = 92.2% of control) (Figure 2B, 2C). There was no
correlation between everolimus inhibitions observed on
cell viability and on CgA secretion (R=0.036, p=0.883).
No correlation was observed between the inhibition of
CgA secretion by everolimus and the WHO grade or Ki67
index of the initial tumor (R=0.237, p= 0.328; R=0.134,
p=0.584 respectively). However, CgA secretion was
repressed from 37 to 69% by everolimus in 4 out of 5
tested tumors with a Ki67≥10% (two grade 3 with Ki67≥
45%). Moreover, no correlation was observed between
CgA inhibition by everolimus and the presence of MEN1
tumor mutations or PTEN, DAXX/ATRX expression
levels.

Effects of everolimus and SSAs in combination,
on cell viability and caspase activities
We have previously shown that, at clinically
relevant concentrations [25, 26], both octreotide and
pasireotide repressed hormonal secretion and cell
viability in established pNETs primary cultures [20]. We
then tested combined treatment of everolimus and SSAs,
on cell viability in 19 pNETs responsive to everolimus
in primary cultures. As previously described [20], 72h
exposure to 1nM octreotide or 1nM pasireotide reduced
cell viability with no significant difference between both
analogs (Figure 3A, 3B, 3C). We have previously shown
a strong correlation between the effects of octreotide
and pasireotide on cell viability. A slight correlation
was observed between everolimus and octreotide effects
on cell viability whereas no correlation was observed
between everolimus and pasireotide (R=0.492, p=0.044;
R=0.217, p=0.402 respectively). No significant correlation
was observed between the inhibition of cell viability by
each SSA and the WHO grade or Ki67 index of the initial
tumor (R< 0.07, p> 0.786 in the different cases). However,
cell viability was largely repressed by octreotide, in 2 out
of 5 tested tumors with a Ki67≥10% (by 53% in a grade
2 tumor with a Ki67=10% and by 74% in a grade 3 tumor
with Ki67= 90%). We did not observed any correlation

treatment of cells with 1nM octreotide or 1nM pasireotide
alone similarly decreased CgA secretion as previously
observed [20] (Figure 4A, 4B), except in one primary
culture which do not respond to SSAs (tumor 2; Table 2).
We did not observe any correlation between everolimus
and octreotide or everolimus and pasireotide inhibition
of CgA secretion (R=0.205, p=0.522; R=0.342, p=0.276
respectively). Inhibition of CgA secretion by combined
treatments was increased in only one primary culture (from
a grade 1 tumor, with Ki67<2%; tumor 4) in comparison
to everolimus or SSAs treatments alone (Figure 4A). We
noticed that in this primary culture, combined treatments
partially reverted cell viability inhibition induced by
each single treatment. CgA secretion was significantly
inhibited in the other 10 primary cultures whatever the
treatment (Figure 4B). However no significant difference
was observed between the different treatments, even in
the combined treatments of 1nM everolimus with 1nM
octreotide or 1nM pasireotide (Figure 4B). These 10

primary cultures were from 2 grade 1, 6 grade 2 and 2
grade 3 tumors with Ki67≥5% in 7 tumors. We did not
observe any correlation between tumor grade, Ki67
index, MEN1 tumor mutations or PTEN, DAXX/ATRX
expression levels of the initial tumor and inhibition of CgA
secretion by the different treatments (R< 0.156, p>0.109).
These results suggested that although everolimus and
SSAs reduced cell viability and CgA secretion in single
treatments, treatment combinations did not achieve any
beneficial impact except in two tumors (4, 8).

Modulation of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways
under everolimus and SSAs single treatments
It has been shown, in neuroendocrine cell lines
or tumors, that everolimus and SSAs might control cell
proliferation through the modulation of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR and/or the MAPKinase ERK1/2 pathways. In
this context, we first explored the phosphorylated level

of key intermediates of both pathways under everolimus
and SSAs single treatments. We assessed the effect of
everolimus, inhibitor of mTORC1, on its downstream
target phosphorylation, p70S6K. After 30 min and 24h of
treatment with 1nM everolimus, p70S6K phosphorylation
was largely decreased, confirming that pNETs cells in
primary cultures are sensitive to everolimus (Figure 5A,
5B). In these conditions, Akt phosphorylation was not
modified during short treatment (30min), whereas it was
increased after 24h of treatment (Figure 5A, 5B). Noted
that although phospho-p70S6K was repressed, phospho-

Akt (P-Akt) was not increased after 24h of everolimus
treatment in two of the seven pNETs analyzed (tumors 5,
20). In addition, 1nM everolimus treatment did not alter
ERK1/2 phosphorylation even after 24h of treatment
(Figure 5A, 5B). Similarly, treatment of pNETs in
primary cultures with 1nM octreotide or 1nM pasireotide
during 30 min or 24h did not significantly modify the
phosphorylation levels of p70S6K, Akt or ERK1/2 (Figure
5C–5F). These results suggested that the SSAs did not
modulate the activity of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways
in our experimental conditions.

was similar in both everolimus as single treatment or in
combined treatments (p=0.796; p=0.750 respectively in the
presence of octreotide plus everolimus and pasireotide plus
everolimus). In the same conditions, drugs combination
did not alter ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 6A, 6D) as
previously observed in the presence of each drug alone
(Figure 5).

We finally assessed the effects of combined

1nM octreotide or 1nM pasireotide during 24h significantly
inhibited p70S6K phosphorylation compared to control or
SSAs in single treatment. However, SSAs did not enhance
everolimus-induced inhibition of p70S6K phosphorylation
(p=0.125; p=0.875 respectively in the presence of octreotide
plus everolimus and pasireotide plus everolimus; Figure

increased P-Akt compared to control conditions or SSAs
in single treatment (Figure 6A, 6C). However, P-Akt level

DISCUSSION
Therapeutic strategy in the management of advanced
pNETs is still challenging. Despite promising efficacy
of targeted therapies observed in cell lines, PFS and
overall survival of patients in clinical trials are lower than

expected, suggesting lack of relevant preclinical models.
We recently established and characterized primary cultures
of human pNETs and demonstrated the anti-secretory and
anti-proliferative effects of both octreotide and pasireotide
[20]. In this report, we show for the first time that the
mTOR inhibitor everolimus reduces both CgA secretion
and cell viability in human primary cultures from pNETs.
Although everolimus and SSAs decrease cell viability and
CgA secretion in single treatments, no benefit is observed
from combined treatments. To further delineate the
mechanisms contributing to these effects, we demonstrate
that everolimus-induced decrease of cell viability is
not due to caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, in
combined treatments, caspase activities induced by SSAs
are reverted. Considering two main signaling pathways
previously shown as involved in NETs tumorigenesis
[27], we show that ERK1/2 pathway is not affected by
everolimus or SSAs as single or combined treatments
in pNETs primary cultures. However, everolimus
hyperactivates Akt, whereas SSAs do not alter PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway. Moreover, in combined treatments,

p70S6K activity is inhibited and Akt is as much activated
as in the presence of everolimus alone.
The anti-proliferative effect of everolimus has been
largely established in different NET cell lines [28–30]
and particularly of pancreatic origin [13, 31, 32]. For the
first time, we show that everolimus represses cell viability
in the majority (90%) of primary cultures from human
pNETs. The efficacy of everolimus is nevertheless variable
and may correlate with the observations of the phase II and
III clinical trials [14, 19] showing that partial or overall
responses were rarely observed despite increase in PFS.
Beside the antitumoral management, control of
hormone hypersecretion is required for up to 30% of
patients with pNET. Advances in the control of hormoneexcess state have been recently reviewed [33]. Whereas
somatostatin analogs are the first-line treatment in the
majority of GEP-NET patients, everolimus has been
shown effective at controlling hormone-excess symptoms
in patients with insulinoma in case reports or in small
series [34–37] and in patients with carcinoid syndrome
[38]. In clinical trials, CgA blood level is commonly

everolimus (Eve), or 1nM octreotide (Oct), or 1nM pasireotide (Pas) alone (diluted in vehicle) or in the presence of 1nM everolimus and
1nM octreotide or 1nM everolimus and 1nM pasireotide as indicated in the figure. The phosphorylated levels of p70S6K, Akt and ERK1/2

considered as a biomarker of NETs. An early decrease
in CgA blood level in response to everolimus has been
correlated with an increase in PFS. So this early CgA
response might have a global predictive value [19].
Here we show that everolimus represses CgA secretion
in 63% of the pNETs primary cultures. Since decrease
in cell number by everolimus treatment should have an
impact on CgA secretion, the level of CgA secretion has
been normalized to the cell number. Moreover, there is
no correlation between everolimus-induced inhibition
of cell viability and CgA secretion, suggesting that
everolimus inhibition of CgA secretion might be a direct
effect on pNET cell secretion. The PI3K pathway has been
identified as a potential regulator of peptide secretion in
the pNET cell lines BON and QGP1 depending on the
inhibitor used (PIK-75, BKM120 or BEZ235) and the
peptide secreted (neurotensin, serotonin or CgA) [39, 40].
Inhibition of both PI3K and mTOR seems to be required
to block peptide secretion [40]. In the primary cultures
of pNETs, inhibition of mTOR seems to be sufficient to
repress CgA secretion (see below). Inhibition of CgA
secretion under everolimus treatment is of importance as
it has been previously shown that CgA and some of its
fragments induce cell proliferation of the small intestinal
NET cell lines L-STS and H-STS through Akt/mTOR
activation [41].
Akt activation following rapalogs treatments is
commonly observed in cancer cells. This effect has been
attributed to loss of physiological negative feedback
loops on PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, limiting the
anti-proliferative potential of these drugs [15, 16, 18].
Activation of Akt by rapalogs is not systematically
observed in NET cell lines [13, 30–32]. In the present
report, all pNETs primary cultures tested are sensitive
to everolimus (using p70S6K inhibition as downstream
marker of mTOR inhibition). P-Akt (ser473) is increased
whereas activation of ERK1/2 is never observed. We
noticed that P-Akt is not upregulated in two tumors (5,
20). These observations indicate a specific upregulation of
the PI3K/Akt pathway through loss of P70S6K/IRS-1 or
P70S6K/mTORC2 negative feedbacks [15, 42]. In these
conditions, everolimus does not induce caspase activity.
This suggests that proapoptotic substrates downstream of
both Akt and p70S6K, may be selectively phosphorylated
and inactivated by Akt [43, 44]. Our results are in
agreement with those of Valentino et al., showing an
inverse correlation between Akt activation and apoptosis
in BON and QGP1 cell lines [40]. Whereas everolimus
induced both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cell
lines [13, 45], its anti-proliferative effect occurs mainly
through cell cycle arrest in the majority of NET cell lines
[28, 30, 46]. This mechanism is likely predominant in
primary cultures of pNETs and may contribute to disease
stabilization observed in patients [14].
SSAs have a favorable safety profile in patients
with NETs [6, 47]. Moreover, previous reports have
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

shown that octreotide decreases PI3K/Akt pathway
activity in pituitary and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell
lines [17, 18]. Since we have previously shown efficacy
of SSAs in pNETs primary cultures [20], it was tempting
to perform co-treatments of everolimus with SSAs to
improve everolimus efficacy. Unfortunately, we cannot
evidence any increase in either cell viability inhibition
nor in the inhibition of CgA secretion in combined
treatments (except in one pNET for each parameter
analyzed). Similar observations have been made on
primary cultures of human bronchial carcinoids treated
with everolimus and pasireotide, although bronchial
carcinoid cells are less responsive than pNETs cells to
these agents as single treatments [48]. Lack of increase in
the anti-proliferative effect of everolimus combined with
octreotide has already been observed in the insulinoma rat
cell line INS1, which is well sensitive to octreotide. In this
cell line, both agents inhibit PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
downstream of Akt through repression of TSC2, mTOR
and p70S6K phosphorylation. Combined treatments did
not enhance this effect, whereas Akt phosphorylation is
not affected [31]. On the contrary, combined treatments
of rapamycin and octreotide proved to be efficient in the
pituitary cell line AtT20 and in human nonfunctioning
pituitary adenoma cells in primary culture. In the AtT20
cells, octreotide increases IRS-1 phosphorylation that
was suppressed by rapamycin, subsequently decreasing
rapamycin-dependent Akt activation triggering cell
cycle arrest through an increase in p27/kip1 level [30].
In human pNET cells octreotide and pasireotide do not
repress the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway neither affect
ERK1/2 pathway, although they decrease cell viability.
Therefore, these pathways do not consistently mediate
SSAs efficacy. In combined treatments with everolimus,
SSAs are not able to repress everolimus-dependent
Akt activation. Moreover, SSAs-dependent caspases
activation is reverted, suggesting that persistent high level
of P-Akt in combined treatments may counteract the cell
death machinery elicited by SSAs by phosphorylation
and inactivation of pro-apoptotic components [43].
Meric-Bernstam et al. recently showed that high level
of P-Akt (detected in everolimus pre- and on-treatment
tumor biopsies) correlated with longer PFS of patients
carrying NET. They concluded that increase in P-Akt
under everolimus treatment is not a marker of everolimus
resistance but rather a marker of everolimus sensitivity
[22]. In this clinical trial, all patients received octreotide
LAR co-treatment [49], suggesting that, octreotide cannot
repress everolimus-dependent Akt activation in the tumors
of patients in vivo. These data are consistent with our
results on primary cultures of pNETs.
Whereas decrease in objective response rate
in combined treatments of everolimus and octreotide
in clinical trial [19] may result from loss in caspasedependent apoptosis observed in pNETs cells in primary
culture, PFS is increased. This could be explained by

indirect mechanisms involving everolimus and SSAsinduced inhibition of tumor angiogenesis that might
contained tumor growth [50]. As a matter of fact, GEPNETs are highly vascularized tumors expressing several
growth factors and their corresponding receptors [51].
Among them, GEP-NETs synthesize and secrete high
level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
a potent pro-angiogenic factor [52]. High expression
of VEGF correlated with increased angiogenesis and
decreased PFS [53]. Both SSAs [54, 55] and rapalogs
[56] impaired VEGF production and secretion in
tumors cells and particularly in NET cells [57, 58].
Moreover, they have been shown to control key steps
of the angiogenic process: endothelial cell proliferation,
endothelial tubule formation [50, 56, 59–61] which
could be involved in the PFS increase observed in
SSA and everolimus combined treatments in clinical
trials. In a phase III trial, sunitinib a multi-tyrosine
kinase receptors inhibitor targeting the VEGF receptor
improved PFS as compared to placebo in patients with
advanced pNETs [62] and obtained approval from
the FDA.
In conclusion, this study represents the first
investigation of combined treatments of everolimus with
octreotide or pasireotide in primary cultures of human
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pNET cells. It shows that everolimus and SSAs repress
cell viability and CgA secretion in single treatment,
however their efficacy is not improved in combined
treatments. These results are consistent with clinical
reports showing that combined treatment do not induce
a marked benefit for patients compared to everolimus
single treatment. Akt activation by everolimus,
unchallenged by SSAs, and loss of caspase-dependent
apoptosis induced by SSAs are molecular events
that strongly support this limited benefit. During the
processing of our manuscript, Falletta et al. established
a link between everolimus-dependent cell viability
of pNET primary cultures, active Akt/mTOR/4EBP
basal levels in the initial tumor tissue and the clinical
aggressiveness of the tumor (high Ki67 index) [63]. In
our study, we cannot highlight any correlation between
cell viability or CgA secretion responses to everolimus
and/or SSAs treatments and the WHO grade or Ki67
index of the initial tumor. Nevertheless, we observed
good responses to everolimus or SSAs in some primary
cultures from grade 3 tumors and/or Ki67≥10%. No
correlation could be established between treatments
responses and MEN1 mutations, PTEN or DAXX/ATRX
expression levels. This suggested that these available
biomarkers are not predictive for the therapeutic response

of pNETs to everolimus or SSAs [64]. Finally, primary
culture of pNETs is a suitable preclinical model to further
define biological effects and underlying mechanisms
for new or other inhibitors of signaling pathways (Ras/
raf/MEK, PI3K, IGF1R…) previously described as
potentially promising for co-targeted therapy in NET cell
lines [45, 46, 65–67].

We have previously shown that 1nM octreotide or
pasireotide were effective on pNET primary culture
[20]. These concentrations are close to their blood
plasma levels (range 2-6nM for octreotide and 4-15nM
for pasireotide) in patients treated monthly with 30120mg octreotide LAR or 20-60mg pasireotide LAR
respectively [25, 26].

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Cell culture

Patients
The present study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Aix-Marseille University (AixMarseille, France) and informed consent was obtained
from each patient. Twenty five patients with pNET tumor
were included in the study (Table 3). All the patients were
bearing tumor requiring surgical removal. Patients were
naïve of antitumor treatment before surgery. The only
criterion for tumors selection was their identification
as primary pNET or pNET derived metastasis by
pathological analysis. Twenty four tumors were primary
pNETs and one was a hepatic metastasis of a pNET. In
22 cases, there was no clinical or biochemical evidence
of hormonal hypersecretion, thus they were considered
as nonfunctional pNETs. In 3 cases, the tumors were
secreting and symptomatic: insulinoma (tumor 18), and
gastrinoma (tumors 19,22), confirmed by pathology
reports. Determination of Ki67 and proliferation index
allowed grade classification (WHO 2010 classification)
(Table 3).

Primary cultures of human pNETs were performed
as previously described [20]. Tumor fragments of the 25
human pNETs, obtained after surgery, were dissociated
mechanically and enzymatically [68]. Tumor cells
were seeded into 24- or 6-well plates (according to the
experiments) coated with extracellular matrix (ECM)
(from bovine endothelial corneal cells as previously
described [68]). Cells were maintained in culture in
D-Valine DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin
(100 µg/ml), and glutamine (100 U/ml), at 37°C in a
water-saturated atmosphere containing 7% CO2. Cell
viability determination and chromogranin A (CgA)
secretion were carried out on cell cultures from 22
and 20 tumors respectively. Other experiments were
performed according to the quantity of available tumor
cells after dissociation of each tumor (range: 1.5 106 to
50 106 cells). The number of primary cultures used for
each experiment is indicated in the figure legends. All the
experiments were done in D-Valine DMEM containing
5% FCS.

Reagents

Genomic analysis of MEN1

Everolimus, octreotide and pasireotide, were
provided by Novartis (Novartis AG, Basel Switzerland).
All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St Quentin Fallavier, France). Stock solutions of 102
M everolimus were prepared in DMSO and kept at
-80°C. Serial dilutions to obtain final concentrations of
10nM to 0.1nM everolimus were done directly in the
culture medium containing 5% Fetal calf serum (FCS)
(corresponding final DMSO dilutions were from 106
to 108 fold). Stock solutions of octreotide (10-3M) and
pasireotide (10-2M) were prepared into phosphate saline
buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01N
acetic acid and kept at -80°C. Serial dilutions to obtain
1nM octreotide or pasireotide were done in the culture
medium containing 5% FCS. In combined treatments
experiments, octreotide and pasireotide were diluted
in the culture medium containing 5% FCS and DMSO
(107 fold dilution) when used as single treatment (diluted
in vehicle). Culture medium containing 5% FCS and
DMSO (107 fold dilution) was used in control conditions
(vehicle) in all the experiments containing everolimus.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections
(FFPE) of 5µm from 25 pNETs were used for DNA
extraction. One to three slides from each pNET were
extracted with the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the size of
tumor section. Briefly, xylene was applied on the slide and
paraffin embedded tumor was scratched into a microfuge
tube containing xylene. Extraction was then performed
according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Purity and
concentration of DNA were assessed using a Nanodrop
ND-1000.
The coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of
the MEN1 gene (NM_003977.2) were PCR amplified
and screened by direct sequencing using specific primers
on an ABI 3500XLDx (Applied Biosystems). Genetic
analysis was performed with variant reporter software and
pathogenicity of allelic variations were evaluated in silico
using a battery of different bioinformatics algorithms
(Polyphen2, UMD-predictor and Alamut 2.2.0 software
[69]. Only variants classified as probably pathogenic or
pathogenic were considered (Table 1).

(rabbit Anti-ATRX antibody, dilution 1/400 (SigmaAldrich, Cat. # HPA001906)) and DAXX (rabbit AntiDAXX antibody, dilution 1/100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat.
# HPA008736)) were performed on the automated
Ventana. Immunolabeling for PTEN (mouse Anti-PTEN
antibody, dilution 1/50 (Dako, Les Ulis, France, Cat. #
6H2.1)) were performed on the automated Dako. The
expression was scored using stromal cells as a positive
internal control. For ATRX and DAXX, positive case
was defined as nuclear staining within tumor cells
and negative staining was defined as lacked nuclear
immunolabeling. For PTEN, only cytoplasmic staining
was studied: low cytoplasmic staining was defined as 1
and moderate to intense cytoplasmic immunolabeling as
2 and 3 respectively.

Caspase activity determination
Cells from each tumor were seeded into 24-well
plates (4×104 cells/well). After 24 h in culture, cells
were treated with the different pharmacological agents
for 24 h. The activity of the executioner caspases 3 and
7 was measured using Caspase Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Results were
expressed as a percentage of the value for the control
conditions.

Protein extraction and western blotting
Cells from each tumor were seeded into 6-well
plates (0.5x106 cells/well). After 24 h in culture, cells were
treated or not with the different pharmacological agents, as
indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then solubilized
at 4°C for 15 min in a lysis buffer [25mM Tris (pH7.4),
150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate,
1 mM EGTA, 1mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl
fluoride (AEBSF), 1 mM Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin
and aprotinin] as previously described [27]. Denatured
proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to PVDF membrane (Perkin Elmer, France).
Immunodetection of the β actin and the phosphorylated
levels of Akt, ERK1/2 and p70S6K was performed using
the mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #
A5441), the polyclonal phospho-AktSer473 (Cat. # 9271),
phospho-p44/42ERK1/2 (Cat. # 9101), the monoclonal
phospho-p70S6KThr389 (Cat. # 9234) rabbit antibodies
respectively (New England Biolab, Ozyme, France) and
an anti-mouse IgG or anti-Rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline
phosphatase as the secondary antibody. Blots were
developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence CDPStar™ detection system (Life Technologies, France) and
quantified using Syngene and Genetools sofwares (Gbox,
Ozyme, France). The total Akt, ERK1/2 and p70S6K
content was systematically monitored by reprobing the
membrane using the polyclonal Akt (Cat. # 9272), the
monoclonal p70S6K (Cat. # 2708) rabbit antibodies (New
England Biolab, Ozyme, France) and the polyclonal ERK1
antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu, France, Cat. #
sc-94). The relative expression of phospho-Akt, phosphoERK2 and phospho-p70S6K was calculated as a ratio to
each total protein respectively and expressed in percent of
the control value.

Real-time quantitative PCR
Total mRNAs were extracted from 3x105 cells using
the RNeasy Microkit (Qiagen). SST2 receptor mRNAs
were detected by real-time quantitative PCR using specific
primers and probes as previously described [70]. To
produce standard curve, cDNA construct was produced,
verified by sequencing and linearized. The mRNA level
of SST2 was normalized to the glucuronidase β (GUSβ)
mRNA level, as previously described [70]. Results were
expressed as copy of mRNA for the SST2 gene/copy of
mRNA for GUSβ.

Cell viability
Cells from each tumor were seeded into 24-well
plates (4×104 cells/well). After 24 h in culture, cells were
treated or not with the different pharmacological agents,
as indicated in the figure legends, for 72 h. The medium
was recovered for CgA determination and cell viability
was assayed by a luminescent assay (CellTiter Glo;
Promega, Charbonnières les Bains, France) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Results were expressed as
percentages of the value for control cells (in the absence
of treatment).

CgA secretion
CgA secretion was determined on the medium
recovered from cell viability experiments after 72 h
of treatment (see above). The recovered culture media
were centrifuged at 400g and stored at -20°C. CgA was
measured using an Elisa kit (Chromogranin A Elisa Kit,
Dako) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. CgA

Statistical analysis
Each assay was performed in triplicate except for
immunoblotting determinations. Results are presented as
the mean ± SEM of at least three tumors. The statistical
significance between groups was determined by the

paired Wilcoxon nonparametric test or Student’s t-test and
unpaired Mann-Whitney test. To measure the strength of
association between pairs of variables without specifying
dependency, Spearman rank order correlations were run.
To measure the link between two qualitative parameters,
Chi square test was performed. Differences were
considered statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05.
