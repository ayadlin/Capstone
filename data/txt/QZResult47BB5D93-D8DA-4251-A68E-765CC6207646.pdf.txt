BACKGROUND: The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of superselective high-dose cisplatin infusion with concomitant radiotherapy (RADPLAT) for previously untreated patients with advanced cancer of
the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. METHODS: Between October 1999 and December 2006, 47 patients
were given superselective intra-arterial infusions of cisplatin (100-120 mg/m2 per week) with simultaneous
intravenous infusions of thiosulfate to neutralize cisplatin toxicity and conventional external-beam radiotherapy (65-70 grays). RESULTS: There were 7 patients (14.9%) diagnosed with T3, 22 (46.8%) with T4a,
and 18 (38.3%) with T4b disease. During the median follow-up period of 4.6 years, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 78.4% for all patients (n ¼ 47), 69.0% for patients with T4b disease (n ¼ 18), and
83.2% for patients with <T4b disease (n ¼ 29). The 5-year overall survival rate was 69.3% for all patients,
61.1% for patients with T4b disease, and 71.1% for patients with < T4b disease. RADPLAT was feasible in 45
patients (95.7%). No patient died as a result of treatment toxicity or had a cerebrovascular accident. Osteonecrosis (n ¼ 7), brain necrosis (n ¼ 2), and ocular/visual problems (n ¼ 16) were observed as late adverse
reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Although a single institution experience, the results of the current study suggest
that RADPLAT can cure the majority of patients with advanced cancer of the nasal cavity and paranasal
sinuses, as well as preserve organs. Late adverse reactions should be monitored in future studies. Cancer

Malignancies of the nasal cavity and paranasal
sinuses are rare neoplasms that account for only 3% of
head and neck carcinomas and approximately 0.5% of
all malignant diseases.1 However, it is more frequently
observed in Japan, with 7% of all cancers arising in the
upper aerodigestive tract.2
Because of the anatomic limitations in making an
early diagnosis and the absence of symptoms in early
stage disease, a large population of these lesions are
advanced at the time of initial presentation. Most
advanced cases require radical surgery followed by postoperative radiation. Frequently, this amounts to a total
maxillectomy or a craniofacial resection with or without
a complete obliteration of the contents of the orbit.
These surgeries result in significant disfigurement and
impairment of function. Despite such radical therapy,
the oncologic outcomes of survival and disease control
are not satisfactory.
For these reasons, many patients refuse surgery,
instead opting for less conventional treatments with lower
cure rates in an effort to spare themselves potential surgical morbidity. Because radiotherapy alone is considered
ineffectual for advanced, unresectable head and neck cancers,3,4 there has been great interest in combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Prospective randomized trials
have demonstrated improved survival rates in patients
treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) compared with
radiotherapy alone for unresectable squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck.5-7
It has also been shown that concurrent radiotherapy
and targeted chemotherapy with cisplatin (hereafter
referred to as RADPLAT) is a promising treatment,8,9
achieving a 90% complete response rate in patients with
advanced head and neck cancer.10 The treatment program
incorporates a novel technique for infusing cisplatin
directly into the tumor bed, while minimizing the effects
of the drug systemically.
Although trials using RADPLAT in patients with
cancer of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses have been
performed at several institutions recently, RADPLAT has
mainly been used as a preoperative treatment,11,12 with to
our knowledge only a few studies testing it as a definitive
treatment.13 Herein, we used RADPLAT for the definitive treatment of patients with cancer of the nasal cavity
and paranasal sinus, and analyzed and discussed the
outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Eligible patients were aged 75 years and had to have a
World Health Organization performance status of 0 to 2,
adequate bone marrow reserve, and adequate liver and
renal function. Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients before entry into the study. Patients who
were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded from the
study. Patients also were required to have histologic proof
of carcinoma of the nasal cavity or the paranasal sinuses
classified as T3 to T4 disease. All patients were initially
evaluated by a multidisciplinary team comprised of head
and neck surgeons and radiation oncologists, and tumors
were classified according to the 2002 International Union
Against Cancer staging system. The stage of the tumor
was determined on the basis of patient history, physical
examination, and chest x-rays, as well as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or
both. Patients either had disease for which radical surgery
was contraindicated or had rejected radical surgery.
Patients with a pathologic diagnosis of SCC, undifferentiated carcinoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma were
eligible for the study, but not if they had distant metastases (M1) or had received prior treatment of any kind for
their cancer.
Chemotherapy
All patients received concurrent intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin and intravenous sodium thiosulfate infusions in the
following manner: cisplatin (at a dose of 100-120 mg/m2
per week for 4 weeks) was infused through a microcatheter
that was placed angiographically to selectively encompass
only the dominant blood supply of the targeted tumor.
Tumors of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses are usually
covered by the internal maxillary artery, but in cases in
which the facial artery, transverse facial artery, or ascending pharyngeal artery covered the tumor, part of the dose
was administered through these alternative arteries.
First, the catheter was positioned in the region of
expected blood supply. Contrast agent was then injected as
rapidly as possible until it refluxed slightly into the more
proximal vessels during peak systole. Next, selective IA CT
arteriography (IA-CTA) was performed to correctly and
carefully identify the feeding arteries and their perfusion,

and cisplatin was infused at the determined rate (Figs. 1
and 2). Simultaneously, sodium thiosulfate (at a dose of
20-24 g) was given intravenously, as described by Robbins
et al, to neutralize the cisplatin.10 All arterial catheterizations were accomplished transcutaneously through the
femoral artery, and the catheters were removed immediately after infusion. So that patients excreted the cisplatin
rapidly, 8 L of lactated Ringer solution were given over a
24-hour period. A 5HT3-receptor antagonist was given to
all patients before arterial infusion to minimize nausea and

vomiting. Chemotherapy was completed during the first 4
weeks, provided that patients responded well in the early
treatment period and had received 3 arterial infusions.

Radiotherapy
All patients received external radiotherapy using a
4-megavolt (MV) or 6-MV x-ray linear accelerator. The
irradiation treatment volume included the entire maxilla, ethmoid sinus, ipsilateral nasal cavity, and

pterygopalatine fossa. For patients with tumor extensions to the orbit, this area was also treated, but efforts
were made to spare the lacrimal gland. The irradiation
schedule was 65 grays (Gy) in 26 fractions over 6.5
weeks by May 2006. Since then, it has changed to
70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks for all patients with
advanced head and neck cancer. The treatment volume
was reduced to 40 Gy for patients in which there was a
low possibility of tumor extension to adjacent structures
such as the ethmoid sinus or orbit.
A modified 45-wedged pair technique was used, in
which the lateral beams were tilted approximately
10 degrees anteriorly with a hope of reducing the risk of
temporal lobe necrosis. Multileaf collimators were also
used for this purpose and to reduce the dose to other
critical structures, such as the optic chiasm and contralateral eye. For patients with lymph node metastases, the
ipsilateral neck was irradiated (40 Gy) using an anteroposterior field and a 25 to 30 Gy boost was given to the positive lymph nodes. A thermoplastic mask was used for
immobilization for all patients. CT and MRI scans were
taken in the same position using the mask so that accurate
diagnosis of the extent of the tumor could be made. The
treatment was planned with a CT simulator and a 3dimensional dose calculation computer. The dose to the
spinal cord was kept below 40 Gy in all instances.

time, scar tissue remains stable, but persistent tumor tissue
will progress, so a patient with radiologic changes that
remained stable and with no signs or symptoms of disease
was considered to be free of disease progression. A biopsy
was performed only to document disease recurrence, if
indicated. All toxicities encountered during therapy were
evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Statistical Analysis

Management of the Neck
Patients with regional lymph node metastasis of the neck
were treated with 65 to 70 Gy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. If lymph node metastases remained or recurred,
patients with resectable neck disease were referred for
cervical lymph node dissection.
Evaluation of Response and Toxicity
Responses were evaluated by clinical examination and/or
CT or MRI studies 6 to 8 weeks after the completion of
therapy. Standard criteria were used to assess the patient
response. A complete response was defined as total resolution of the macroscopically visible tumor, and a partial
response was defined as a 50% reduction in the
macroscopically visible tumor. Because it is difficult to
differentiate between radiographic changes related to the
treatment and scar tissue from persisting tumors, we
labeled patient outcomes to reflect this uncertainty. Over

The major endpoint of the study was overall survival.
Additional endpoints included local control rate (local
progression-free rate) and toxicity. All patients were
closely observed during the follow-up period, the median
of which was 4.6 years (range, 2.1-9.2 years).
Cases of persistent or recurrent primary or neck disease after the completion of RADPLAT were considered
to be local or regional failures, regardless of whether salvage therapy was successful. Probabilities of overall survival, which included death from any cause, and local
control rates (local progression-free rates computed from
the beginning of treatment to the time of local disease recurrence) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.

RADPLAT at Hokkaido University Hospital (Sapporo,
Japan). There were 36 men and 11 women, with a median age of 56 years (range, 25-73 years). Detailed
patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Of the 47
patients, 36 (76.6%) had tumors arising in the maxillary
sinus, 8 (17%) in the ethmoid sinus, and 3 (6.4%) in the
nasal cavity. There were 36 patients (76.6%) who had
SCCs, 9 (19.1%) undifferentiated carcinomas, and the
remaining 2 (4.3%) had adenoid cystic carcinomas.
T and N classifications are shown in Table 2. There
were 7 patients (14.9%) diagnosed with T3 disease, 22
(46.8%) with T4a disease, and 18 (38.3%) with T4b disease. Lymph node involvement was present in 6 patients
(12.8%). Two patients with large tumors received induction chemotherapy before radiotherapy to avoid exposing
the eyeball and/or optic nerve of the unaffected side to
radiation. The protocol of induction chemotherapy was a
combination of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and docetaxel.
One patient received 1 course and the other received 2
courses of treatment. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy
was used for 1 patient to avoid exposing the eyeball and
the optic nerve of the unaffected side to radiation.

Compliance
RADPLAT was feasible (3 or 4 infusions of IA cisplatin
and a full dose of radiotherapy within 7 days of treatment
interruptions) in 45 patients (95.7%). One patient
received only 1 cycle of IA chemotherapy and had his
radiotherapy interrupted for 30 days because of sepsis and
poor general condition. Another patient experienced
severe drug eruption after each IA chemotherapy, and
therfore RADPLAT was withdrawn after 2 courses of IA
chemotherapy and 50 Gy of radiotherapy. The patient
then underwent a total maxillectomy.

* All toxicities encountered during therapy were evaluated according to the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).

Toxicity
Although the treatment regimen was intensive, acute toxicity was manageable in most patients (Table 3) and none
died as a result of treatment toxicity. Thirty-five patients
(74.5%) experienced grade 3 to 4 toxicity. Nonhematologic side effects included mucositis (n ¼ 9), nausea/vomiting (n ¼ 4), and neurologic signs (n ¼ 2). No patient had a
cerebrovascular accident. Hematologic toxicity consisted of
leukopenia (n ¼ 14), anemia (n ¼ 4), and thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 2). Arterial infusion had to be stopped after only 1
infusion in 1 patient who developed sepsis because of toxicity. No surviving patients required feeding tube support.
Osteonecrosis, brain necrosis, and ocular/visual
problems occurred as late adverse reactions. A total of 7
patients experienced osteonecrosis, including 5 cases of
the maxilla, 1 of the mandible, and 1 of the frontal bone.
Patients with grade 3 mandible necrosis required reconstruction of the mandible with free flap transfer. The
remaining 6 patients developed grade 2 osteonecrosis,
which was manageable with minor sequestrectomy. Two
patients developed brain necrosis. Of these, 1 developed
seizures that were well controlled by an anticonvulsant
drug. The other suffered mild dementia.
Severe ocular/visual problems (grade 3 of 4)
occurred in 16 of the 38 patients who were followed over
2 years. One of these required enucleation of a painful
eye ball. Severe ocular/visual problems occurred in 14

(56%) of 25 patients with tumors invading the orbit
and/or invading the inferior wall of the orbit. These
patients were considered for orbital exenteration if the
need for radical surgery was indicated. Conversely, severe
ocular/visual problems occurred in 2 (15.4%) of 13
patients without tumors invading the orbit and/or invading the inferior wall of the orbit.

Response of Neck Disease

Local Control and Overall Survival
The patient who experienced a severe drug eruption and
underwent a total maxillectomy was treated as a local failure. The 5-year local progression-free survival rate was
78.4% for all patients (n ¼ 47), 69.0% for patients with
T4b disease (n ¼ 18), and 83.2% for patients with < T4b
disease (n ¼ 29) (Fig. 3). The 5-year overall survival rate
was 69.3 for all patients, 61.1% for patients with T4b disease, and 71.1% for patients with < T4b disease (Fig. 4).
Response of the Primary Disease
Of the 47 patients entered into the treatment program, complete responses in the primary site were obtained in 13
(27.7%) patients and partial responses in 31 (66.0%) patients.
However, the primary disease was well controlled by RADPLAT in 39 patients (83.0%) at the time of last follow-up.
The remaining 8 patients (17.0%) had persistent or recurrent
primary disease after the completion of RADPLAT. Viable tumor cells were observed in a surgical specimen from the patient
who underwent a total maxillectomy. Since then, the patient
has had no further evidence of disease. He was included in the
category of primary disease not controlled by RADPLAT.
Cancer

October 15, 2009

Among the 6 patients with positive neck disease, 4 were
well controlled by RADPLAT without surgery. One
patient underwent a cervical lymph node dissection 4
months after treatment for a suspicious residual lymph
node. Another patient had a lymph node that recurred 10
months after therapy, and therefore underwent a cervical
lymph node dissection 11 months after the treatment. As
a result, viable tumors were observed in the surgical specimens of both patients. Six patients classified as having N0
disease before therapy developed neck metastases after
RADPLAT; of these, 4 were treated successfully by salvage
neck dissection.
In 1 patient, neck disease and distant metastasis
developed at the same time, whereas in another patient,
the site of the primary tumor recurrence was found at the
same time as neck disease. Neither patient was able to
undergo a cervical lymph node dissection and therefore
both were treated with systemic chemotherapy.

Pattern of Recurrence
The site of first disease recurrence was identified whenever
possible. Recurrence first occurred at the primary tumor
site in 8 patients. Of these, 3 underwent salvage surgery,
but only 1 patient was successfully salvaged. Neck disease
and distant metastasis were found at the same time in 2
patients, and distant metastasis was found in 3 patients
without a primary or neck recurrence. Two patients died
of other causes without evidence of disease.

DISCUSSION
Historically, sinonasal malignancies have been treated
with primary radiotherapy. However, treatment with
radiotherapy alone has produced disappointing results in
the case of patients with primary advanced tumors.14-16 In
addition, high doses of radiation pose a significant risk for
injury to optic structures, such as the retina, optic nerves,
and chiasm.17 Combined radical surgery and radiotherapy
constitutes the standard treatment for patients with cancer
of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus as well as most epithelial malignancies.18,19 However, the overall treatment
of sinonasal malignancies has resulted in 5-year survival
rates in the range of 30% to 50%, despite refinements in
imaging studies such as CT scans and MRI, surgical techniques, and radiotherapy.19-23 Moreover, survival is further reduced for patients with T4 tumors.
Functional and cosmetic outcomes after surgical
treatment for advanced tumors, especially those classified
as T4, are also far from satisfactory from the standpoint of
patients. Therefore, some patients refuse surgical treatment, whereas others have unresectable disease. For these
patients, radiotherapy is suggested, but is not expected to
eliminate the tumor.24
Recently, prospective randomized trials have demonstrated improved survival rates in patients treated with
CRT versus radiotherapy alone for unresectable SCC of
the head and neck.5-7 Harrison et al25 also reported local
progression-free survival rate of 94% among 20 patients
with unresectable malignant tumors of the skull base who
were treated with aggressive CRT, among whom were 15
patients with SCC. These findings indicate that CRT is
the only viable option, and can be very effective in such
cases of brain invasion by SCC.
Rosen et al achieved a long-term disease-free interval
in 11 of 12 patients with paranasal sinus cancer (92% survival after a median follow-up of 55 months; range, 13-105
months) using multimodality therapy comprised of 5-fluorouracil–cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by standard surgical resection and radiotherapy with
or without concomitant hydroxyurea and 5-fluorouracil.26
These data represent encouraging numbers from a small series and suggest that chemotherapy has a role in the treatment of patients with paranasal sinus cancer.
Robbins, a pioneer of superselective arterial infusion
of cisplatin, reported 5-year overall survival and locoregional control rates of 38.8% and 74.3%, respectively, in
4712

213 patients with stage III to IV SCC of the head and
neck.8 IA delivery of chemotherapy has the potential to
increase drug concentrations at tumor sites, whereas the
IA infusion of cisplatin together with sodium thiosulfate
enables the lowering of systemic toxicity. Paranasal sinus
carcinomas tend to be encompassed mostly within the territory of terminal branches of the internal maxillary artery,
which can be catheterized consistently and repeatedly;
therefore, patients with such malignancies are good candidates for RADPLAT treatment.
A phase 2 protocol designed by the University of
Tennessee Health Sciences Center in Memphis in 1993
takes advantage of the benefits of multimodality therapy.11 Patients receive up to 4 weekly infusions of highdose cisplatin by means of superselective transfemoral
catheterization of the internal maxillary artery. Concurrently, they also receive 50 Gy of external-beam radiotherapy over 5 weeks. Definite surgical resection is performed
6 to 8 weeks after the completion of CRT. Results from
the first 19 patients were recently reported within a median follow-up of 53 months. Of these, 16 patients (84%)
had T4 disease. Surgery was conservative, with a high rate
of preservation of orbital contents, visual function, midface structures, and palate, as well as a lack of any facial
incisions, resulting in an improved overall cosmetic and
functional outcome. The overall survival rates at 2 and 5
years were 67% and 51%, respectively. In the 13 patients
in whom the disease was controlled after surgery, only 2
(15%) developed local failure. They reported no visual
loss except for cataracts in 2 patients. However, 50 Gy of
radiation is not enough to eradicate advanced cancer, even
if surgery is combined. Conversely, delivering a high curative dose of radiation has been considered to result in
damage to the optic nerve, chiasm, or brain.17 We are
concerned that reducing the radiation dose results in poor
local control, because to our knowledge wide resection
and postoperative radiotherapy have not previously been
reported to achieve satisfactory survival rates.19-23
In our institution, RADPLAT is the definitive treatment of choice for patients with advanced nasal cavity and
nasal paranasal sinus cancer to achieve improved survival
rates and to avoid major surgery. We consider that
patients with tumors invading orbital fat, orbital musculature, or involvement of the orbital apex usually require orbital content extirpation if surgery is indicated.27
Therefore, we believe that eye-related complications may
Cancer

occur in such patients, although efforts should be made to
spare vision and to avoid complications using treatments
such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy and heavy particle radiotherapy. Although some complications occurred
in the current study, careful planning of radiation and IA
infusion limited these to an acceptable level.
Although IA chemotherapy is sometimes regarded as
dangerous because of the risk of catheter-related problems,
cerebrovascular accidents, and severe systemic complications,28,29 no treatment-related deaths were encountered in
the current study and no cerebrovascular accidents occurred;
indeed only 1 case of greater than 200 has occurred in our
institution to date, with a full recovery reported. We consider this to be the result of careful patient selection, superselective catheterization, and the management of side effects
and toxicities during RADPLAT therapy. Thus, the findings of the current study were of a better outcome than previous reports from many centers, and excellent cosmetic
outcomes were achieved because surgery was not performed.
Because patient numbers were small and this was a singleinstitution experience, a multi-institutional trial is needed to
prove that this strategy is feasible and effective.
In conclusion, superselective high-dose cisplatin infusion with concomitant radiotherapy can result in organ
preservation and cure in the majority of patients with
advanced cancer of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.
Toxicity was manageable in the current study, and no
patient died as a result of treatment toxicity. However, late
adverse reactions such as osteonecrosis, brain necrosis, and
ocular/visual problems should be monitored in future trials.
Nonetheless, these results do suggest that significant progress has been made in the management of these diseases.
