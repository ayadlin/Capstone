Abstract
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) exhibits high remission rates after initial chemoimmunotherapy, but with
relapses with treatment, refractory disease is the most common outcome, especially in CLL with the deletion of
chromosome 11q or 17p. In addressing the need of treatments for relapsed disease, we report the identiﬁcation of
an existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved small-molecule drug to repurpose for CLL treatment.
Auranoﬁn (Ridaura) is approved for use in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but it exhibited preclinical efﬁcacy in
CLL cells. By inhibiting thioredoxin reductase activity and increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species levels,
auranoﬁn induced a lethal endoplasmic reticulum stress response in cultured and primary CLL cells. In addition,
auranoﬁn displayed synergistic lethality with heme oxygenase-1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase inhibitors against
CLL cells. Auranoﬁn overcame apoptosis resistance mediated by protective stromal cells, and it also killed
primary CLL cells with deletion of chromosome 11q or 17p. In TCL-1 transgenic mice, an in vivo model of CLL,
auranoﬁn treatment markedly reduced tumor cell burden and improved mouse survival. Our results provide a
rationale to reposition the approved drug auranoﬁn for clinical evaluation in the therapy of CLL. Cancer Res; 74(9);

Introduction
Accelerated expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) cells with bulky lymphadenopathy and organomegaly,
with or without compromised hematopoiesis, is treated with
myelotoxic chemoimmunotherapy (1, 2). In CLL, the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes
(IGHV), acquired chromosomal abnormalities including deletion 17p13 and deletion 11q22, as well as increased expression
of ZAP70 (zeta-associated protein) or CD38 are features associated with poor outcome (3). Notwithstanding high remission

rates due to initial chemoimmunotherapy, eventual relapse
with treatment-refractory disease is the typical outcome,
except in a minority of patients who successfully receive
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (2, 3). Therefore, novel
effective and safe treatments need to be tested and developed.
To this end, repurposing of an existing and U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved small-molecule drug in the
treatment of CLL is a worthy goal (4).
Compared with normal lymphocytes, CLL cells have intrinsically higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are
under oxidative stress due to an imbalanced redox status (5–8).
ROS-mediated oxidation of the sulfur-containing amino acids
in proteins such as phosphatases and transcription factors, for
example, NF-kB, p53, hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, and nuclear
factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), regulates their function and role in modifying cellular growth and survival (9).
Elevated ROS levels also render CLL cells more sensitive to
agents that further increase ROS and oxidative stress (6). Nrf2
activates genes involved in the response to oxidative stress,
including heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX-1) and glutamate cysteine ligase modiﬁer (GCLM), which are involved in glutathione
(GSH) synthesis (10, 11). Elevated levels of ROS may overcome
antioxidant mechanisms and induce protein oxidation, which
leads to intracellular accumulation of potentially toxic, misfolded, and polyubiquitylated (poly-Ub) proteins (12). This
accumulation triggers an HDAC6-mediated, adaptive and protective heat shock and proteotoxic stress response (13, 14).
During this, HDAC6 binds to the poly-Ub–misfolded proteins

Auranoﬁn Induces Oxidative/ER Stress in CLL Cells

and shuttles these into a protective aggresome, concomitantly
causing the dissipation of the p97/HDAC6/hsp90/HSF1 (heat
shock factor 1) complex, followed by induction of transcriptional activity of HSF1 and HSPs (15, 16). The dissociation of
HDAC6 from this complex also causes hyperacetylation and
inhibition of the chaperone function of hsp90 (17), with
resulting depletion of CLL-relevant, progrowth and prosurvival
hsp90 client proteins such as ZAP70, c-RAF, AKT, as well as of
HDAC6 itself (18–21). Thus, ROS-induced oxidative stress can
lead to proteotoxic and unfolded protein response (UPR),
which in turn also triggers estrogen receptor (ER) stress, with
activation of the mediators of the ER stress response (22–24).
Normally, ER stress is designed to be protective by mediating
the shutdown of general protein synthesis and by increasing
the production of molecular chaperones, including the ER
resident hsp70 homologue, glucose-regulated protein 78
(GRP78; refs. 22, 23). However, if ER stress is protracted, lethal
ER stress ensues through prolonged activation of the pro-death
ER stress pathways mediated by CHOP (CAAT/enhancerbinding protein homologous protein) and IRE1 (inositol
requiring protein 1; refs. 23–25). Countering this, CLL cells
receive numerous prosurvival signals from the stroma microenvironment in the bone marrow and lymph nodes through
multiple mechanisms that activate B-cell receptor and the
chemokine receptor CXCR4 signaling (26–29). Recently, stromal cells were also shown to protect CLL cells against
increased intracellular levels of ROS, by providing cysteine
and bolstering the intracellular levels of GSH in CLL cells (30).
Auranoﬁn, an oral gold-containing triethylphosphine used
in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has been previously
reported to inhibit cytosolic and mitochondrial thioredoxin
reductase (TrxR) and induce ROS levels (31). On the basis of the
preliminary results of an in vitro high-throughput screen to
gauge the activity against primary CLL cells, and toward the
ultimate goal of repurposing auranoﬁn for the treatment of
CLL, we determined the in vitro and in vivo activity of auranoﬁn, and its mechanism of action, against CLL cells. Our
ﬁndings demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that, auranoﬁn induces
lethal oxidative, proteotoxic, and ER stress response in cultured and patient-derived primary CLL cells, including those
with the biologic and genetic features that are associated with
poor clinical outcome in CLL.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies
Auranoﬁn (C20H35AuO9PS) was suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide at 5 mmol/L concentration and stored in volumes of 500
mL at 80 C, then aliquoted in volumes of 10 mL and stored at
20 C to be used once without refreezing. Additional reagents
and detailed antibody information are provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. Polyclonal acetylated K69
hsp90 antibody was generated by Alpha Diagnostics as previously described (17).
Cell lines and primary CLL cells
Human chronic B-cell leukemia, MEC-1 cells were obtained
from the DSMZ). All experiments with cell lines were conducted

www.aacrjournals.org

within 6 months after thawing or obtaining from DSMZ. Cell
line authentication was done by DSMZ. The DSMZ uses short
tandem repeat proﬁling for characterization and authentication
of cell lines. Cells were cultured in Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco's
Medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. Cells were passaged two to three times per week
and frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. HK cells were kindly
provided and characterized by Jianguo Tao (Mofﬁtt Cancer
Center, Tampa, FL), cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS, and maintained as previously described (32). Exponentially growing
cells were used for all described experiments. Primary CLL cells
(Supplementary Table S1) were obtained with informed consent (in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki) under a
research protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Kansas University Medical Center (Kansas City, KS; Protocol
#12392) or the NIH (7, 30). Primary CLL cells were isolated from
the peripheral blood and CD19þ B cells were puriﬁed, utilizing a
positive selection immunomagnetic separation kit (Stem Cell
Technologies). Normal human CD34þ cells were obtained from
delinked, deidentiﬁed human cord blood samples.
Assessment of mitochondrial transmembrane potential
(Dcm) and reactive oxygen species
CLL cells (0.5  106 cells/tube) were incubated with 10
nmol/L 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6), 2.5
mmol/L dihydroethidium, and 10 mL of CD19-APC, in 400 mL
AIM-V in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 C for 30
minutes, then analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
Thioredoxin reductase assay
CLL cells were treated with auranoﬁn for 8 hours. The effects
of auranoﬁn treatment on TrxR activity were determined with
a Thioredoxin Reductase Assay Kit (Cayman Chemicals)
according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Evaluation of cell viability
Primary CLL peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC;
0.5  106 cells per well) were plated in triplicate in a ﬁnal
volume of 100 mL, in the presence of serial dilutions of
auranoﬁn (0.125–4.0 mmol/L) for 24 hours. Cell viability was
determined using a CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (MTS) Kit (Promega). The percentage of
viable cells following auranoﬁn treatment is reported relative
to the untreated control CLL cells.
Viability analysis in nurse-like cell cocultures
Primary CLL cells were cocultured in the presence or
absence of nurse-like cells (NLC; ref. 33), with or without
auranoﬁn, for 24 hours. Cell viability was determined by ﬂow
cytometry using DiOC6 and CD19 stain.
Assessment of apoptosis
Untreated or drug-treated MEC-1 or primary CD19þ CLL
cells were stained with Annexin-V, and the percentage of
Annexin V–positive apoptotic cells were determined by ﬂow
cytometry, as previously described (25). To analyze synergism
between auranoﬁn and zinc deuterophyrin IX 2,4-bis-ethylene
glycol (ZnBG) or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), cells were

treated with auranoﬁn (200–1,000 nmol/L) and ZnBG (10–20
mmol/L) or BSO (1–10 mmol/L) for 48 hours. The combination
index (CI) for each drug combination was calculated utilizing
Calcusyn (Biosoft). CI values of less than 1.0 indicate a synergistic interaction of the two agents.
Confocal microscopy
Primary CD19þ CLL cells were incubated with indicated
doses of auranoﬁn for 16 hours and cytospun onto glass
slides. Cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized as previously
described (25). Then, cells were stained with Nrf-2 and
HSF-1 antibodies, counterstained with phalloidin (which
binds F-actin) and 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI),
and coverslips were mounted. The images were visualized
using a Carl Zeiss LSM-5 PASCAL confocal microscope with
a 63/1.2 NA oil objective. Images were processed with LSM
Image browser software (Zeiss).
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR analyses
Total RNA was extracted from untreated and auranoﬁntreated MEC-1 or primary CD19þ CLL cells using an RNAqueous 4PCR Kit from Ambion and reverse transcribed. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis and TaqMan probes were used
to determine the expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, HMOX-1,
and GCLM. The relative expression of each mRNA was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
Gene expression analysis
Total RNA from primary CLL PBMCs treated with auranoﬁn for 4, 8, or 10 hours or left untreated for 10 hours was
puriﬁed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and converted
to biotin-labeled cRNA. This was hybridized to a Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix). Signal intensity
and fold changes in gene expression were analyzed by the
microarray analysis, using Affymetrix GeneChip Operating
Software, as detailed in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods. All microarray data used in this manuscript are
deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus.
Short hairpin RNA
Lentiviral short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting HMOX1
and GADD153/CHOP or nontargeting shRNA (sh-NT) were
transduced into MEC-1 cells. Forty-eight hours posttransduction, the cells were washed with complete media and
plated with or without auranoﬁn for 8 hours for immunoblot
analysis or 48 hours for assessing apoptosis. MEC-1 cells with
stable knockdown of CHOP were obtained by culturing the
transduced cells in 0.5 to 1.0 mg/mL of puromycin. Stable
knockdown cells were treated for 48 hours with auranoﬁn to
determine the effects of CHOP knockdown on auranoﬁninduced apoptosis.
Immunoprecipitation of hsp90 from CLL cells
Primary CD19þ CLL cells were treated with auranoﬁn for 8
hours. Following treatment, cells were harvested, lysed, and
hsp90 was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates as
previously described (25). HDAC6, Hsf-1, and p97/VCP immunoblot analyses were performed on the hsp90 immunopreci-

pitates. Blots were stripped and reprobed for detection of
hsp90.
Immunoblot analyses
Immunoblot analyses were conducted as described in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
In vivo animal studies
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). TCL-1 transgenic
mice genotype: (Tcl1-tg:p53/) have been previously
described (34, 35). TCL-1 mice (n ¼ 5; age 2 months) were
treated with auranoﬁn by intraperitoneal injection at the
dosage of 10 mg/kg daily, 5 days per week (Monday–Friday)
for 2 weeks, and treatment was stopped. The total leukemia cell
burden was measured in peritoneal ﬂuid from pretreated and
auranoﬁn-treated animals, as previously described (30). Survival of TCL-1 mice treated with auranoﬁn compared with
untreated mice is represented by a Kaplan–Meier plot.
Statistical analysis
Signiﬁcant differences between values obtained in a population of MEC-1 or primary CD19þ CLL cells treated with
different experimental conditions were determined using a
two-tailed, paired t test or a one way ANOVA analysis within
Microsoft Excel 2010 software or using GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software, Inc.). P values < 0.05 were assigned
signiﬁcance. For the in vivo studies, differences in the mean
leukemia burden between pretreatment and post-auranoﬁn
treatment were determined by a one-way ANOVA test.
Pvalues of <0.05 were assigned signiﬁcance. Differences in
the survival of TCL-1 mice treated with auranoﬁn were
calculated by a Mantel–Cox log-rank test. P values < 0.05
were assigned signiﬁcance.

Results
Auranoﬁn causes loss of viability of CD19þ B-CLL cells
Our ﬁndings in Fig. 1A demonstrate that exposure to auranoﬁn for 24 hours dose dependently induced loss of viability of
primary CLL cells. The clinical and prognostic molecular-cytogenetic features of each of the 50 primary CLL samples are
described in Supplementary Table S1. The table also provides
the IC50 values of auranoﬁn against each of the primary CLL
samples. Treatment with auranoﬁn also signiﬁcantly induced
apoptosis of primary CLL, but not of normal CD34þ hematopoietic progenitor cells (Fig. 1B). Auranoﬁn treatment increased
the percentage of Annexin V–positive, CD19þ primary CLL cells,
with relative sparing of the normal CD3þ T lymphocytes (Fig.
1C–E). As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with auranoﬁn was
equally active against CLL with unmutated as compared with
the mutated IGHV genes. In contrast, treatment with auranoﬁn
induced signiﬁcantly greater loss of cell viability of ZAP70þ
versus ZAP70 CLL cells (Fig. 2B). This was especially so
following exposure to the lower versus the higher concentrations
of auranoﬁn (Fig. 2C). Exposure to auranoﬁn dose dependently
induced apoptosis in the cultured CLL MEC-1 cells, which carry

the del17p chromosome. This was associated with an increase in
the percentage of Sub-G1 cells and cleavage of caspase-3 and
PARP (Fig. 2D and E and Supplementary Fig. S2). At lower
concentrations, there was a signiﬁcant difference in auranoﬁninduced apoptosis in the primary CLL cells containing del17p
compared with those containing del13q or del11q (P < 0.05; Fig.
2D). On the other hand, at higher concentrations, there was no
signiﬁcant difference in auranoﬁn-induced apoptosis in the
primary CLL cells containing del17p, del13q, or del11q (Fig.
2D). Overall, auranoﬁn treatment was as effective in inducing
apoptosis of the favorable as compared with CLL cells with the
unfavorable cytogenetic predictors of clinical outcome (Fig. 2F).
Auranoﬁn overcomes protection due to stromaassociated cells and exerts lethal in vivo activity against
CLL cells
We next determined the in vitro effect of stroma, represented
in our studies by coculture with the HK cells or the NLCs, on the

lethal effects of auranoﬁn on CLL cells (32, 33). As shown in Fig.
2G, auranoﬁn treatment dose dependently induced loss of cell
viability of MEC-1 cells, which was signiﬁcantly attenuated by
coculture with HK cells. Coculture with NLCs also improved
the viability of primary CLL samples in vitro (Fig. 2H). However,
our ﬁndings also show that auranoﬁn treatment induced loss
of viability of primary CLL cells, regardless of the coculture in
vitro with NLCs (Fig. 2H). In contrast, treatment with auranoﬁn
did not reduce the viability of NLCs (Supplementary Fig. S3A–
S3C). We next tested the in vivo activity of auranoﬁn against
CLL cells in the TCL-1 transgenic mice (34, 35). Because the
TCL-1 gene is among the top genes upregulated in CLL cells by
coculture with the stromal cells, this mouse model is also
particularly relevant to ascertain the in vivo protective role of
the stromal microenvironment for CLL cells (36). As shown
in Fig. 2I and Supplementary Table S2, treatment with auranoﬁn caused a reduction in the leukemia cell burden in each
of the 5 TCL-1 mice tested. The number of CLL cells in the

peritoneal cavity was reduced by >90% during the 2 weeks of
auranoﬁn treatment (P ¼ 0.00019). These ﬁndings demonstrate that auranoﬁn is able to exert in vitro and in vivo lethal
effects against CLL cells despite the protective effects of
stroma. Treatment with auranoﬁn also signiﬁcantly improved
the survival of the TCL-1 mice compared with mice that
received no treatment (P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 2J).

We next determined whether exposure to auranoﬁn inhibits
TrxR activity, as well as induces ROS levels and apoptosis of the
MEC-1 and primary CLL cells. Treatment with auranoﬁn
inhibited the total intracellular TrxR activity determined by
a TrxR activity assay (Cayman Chemical Company), and

concomitantly increased ROS levels in MEC-1 and primary CLL
cells (Fig. 3A). Cotreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl
cysteine (NAC) inhibited auranoﬁn-mediated ROS induction
in MEC-1 and primary CLL cells (Fig. 3B and Supplementary
Fig. S1). Because they exhibit higher levels of ROS and activity
of Nrf2, CLL cells have concomitant overexpression of the
downstream Nrf2 targets such as HMOX-1 (10, 11). Therefore,
here, we determined the effect of auranoﬁn-induced ROS on
the levels of Nrf2 and its target genes in CLL cells. The confocal
immunoﬂuorescence analyses in Fig. 3C demonstrate that
auranoﬁn treatment not only increased the levels of Nrf2
protein, but also augmented its nuclear localization in primary
CLL cells. Moreover, immunoblot analyses of the cell lysates of

www.aacrjournals.org

MEC-1 and primary CLL cells conﬁrmed that auranoﬁn treatment increased Nrf2 levels as well as the levels of Nrf2-activated
genes, including HMOX-1, TxNIP, and GCLM (Fig. 3D). In
addition, cotreatment with NAC attenuated auranoﬁn-mediated increase in the levels of Nrf2 and its targeted gene
expressions, especially of HMOX-1 and GCLM, conﬁrming
their linkage to auranoﬁn-induced oxidative stress (Fig. 3E).
In primary CLL cells, auranoﬁn-induced ROS levels were
associated with increases in the mitochondrial permeability
transition (Dcm) and percentage of Annexin V–positive cells
(Fig. 3F). Cotreatment with NAC inhibited auranoﬁn-induced
apoptosis of primary CLL cells (Fig. 3G). In cultured MEC-1
cells, cotreatment with NAC and auranoﬁn inhibited

Auranoﬁn perturbs biologic networks of genes in CLL
cells
We also determined the effects of auranoﬁn treatment on
gene expression microarray proﬁle in primary CLL cells.
Figure 4A shows a heatmap of gene expression changes.
Auranoﬁn treatment for 4 or 10 hours signiﬁcantly upregulated or downregulated the mRNA expression of a large
number of genes, and the fold changes in the 39 most altered
mRNA gene expressions are shown in Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S3. The ﬁgure shows that mRNA expression
levels of the Nrf2 target genes HMOX-1 and GCLM, as well as
of CHOP and the key HSPs were markedly induced by
auranoﬁn treatment in the primary CLL cells. To conﬁrm
the induction of CHOP and Nrf2 target genes, total RNA from
untreated and auranoﬁn-treated cells was also reverse tran-

scribed and the resulting cDNA was used for quantitative
PCR with the speciﬁc TaqMan Real-time PCR probes. This
conﬁrmed that auranoﬁn treatment markedly increased the
mRNA expression of the HMOX-1, GCLM1, and CHOP genes
in primary CLL cells with or without deletion of 17p (Fig. 4C
and D). Datasets of genes with altered expression proﬁle
derived from microarray analyses were imported into the
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Tool (Ingenuity H Systems). Within the gene list, IPA identiﬁed the top ﬁve most
perturbed networks in primary CLL cells following treatment with auranoﬁn and assigned a score for these associated network functions (Supplementary Table S4). The score
(i.e., a score of 41) assigned by IPA indicates the probability
(1 in 1041) that the focus genes in the dataset are grouped
together in a perturbed network due to random chance
alone. The differentially expressed genes and the ﬁve most
perturbed biologic networks identiﬁed by IPA revealed
signiﬁcant connectivity between genes (nodes) within different biologic networks (Supplementary Fig. S4). Among

of three independent experiments; bars, SEM.  , apoptosis values signiﬁcantly greater in sh-HMOX1–transduced cells compared with sh-NT–transduced cells
(P < 0.001). C, MEC-1 cells (black line) and primary CLL cells (gray line) were exposed to of auranoﬁn (100–500 nmol/L) and ZnBG (10–20 mmol/L)
for 48 hours. After treatment, the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by ﬂow cytometry. Median dose effect and isobologram analyses were
performed utilizing Calcusyn software. CI values less than 1.0 indicate a synergistic interaction between the two agents. D, MEC-1 cells (black line) and primary
CLL cells (gray line) were treated with auranoﬁn (10–250 nmol/L) and BSO (1–10 mmol/L) for 48 hours. Following this, the percentage of apoptotic
cells was determined by ﬂow cytometry. Isobologram analyses were performed as described above.

these, free radical scavenging, cellular compromise, and
protein degradation networks were the highest rated networks with high signiﬁcance scores.
Inhibition of HMOX-1 and GCLM augments auranoﬁninduced apoptosis of CLL cells
We next determined the mechanistic relevance of auranoﬁn-induced, oxidative stress response, which is represented by Nrf2-induced levels of HMOX-1 and GCLM. For
this, we knocked down HMOX-1 gene expression by shRNA
or inhibited HMOX-1 activity by treatment with its selective
inhibitor ZnBG (37). The effect of this was determined on
auranoﬁn-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment
with shRNA to HMOX-1 depleted HMOX-1 protein levels but
did not affect the levels of Nrf2, GCLM1, or induce the levels
of cleaved caspase-3. In contrast, cotreatment with shRNA to
HMOX-1, but not with the nontargeted shRNA, signiﬁcantly
increased auranoﬁn-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). In addition,
cotreatment with ZnBG and auranoﬁn synergistically
induced apoptosis of MEC-1 and primary CLL cells. This
was assessed by the median dose effect isobologram analyses where the CIs were noted to be <1.0 (Fig. 5C and

www.aacrjournals.org

Supplementary Fig. S5; ref. 38). GCLM is the modiﬁer subunit that heterodimerizes with the catalytic subunit (GCLC)
of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), an enzyme catalyzing the
initial rate-limiting step in the GSH synthesis (39). By
inhibiting GCL activity, treatment with BSO inhibits GSH
synthesis (40). We also determined the apoptotic effects of
cotreatment with BSO on auranoﬁn-induced apoptosis of
MEC-1 and primary CLL cells. Cotreatment with BSO synergistically enhanced auranoﬁn-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5D).
Again, the CI values were <1.0. Collectively, these ﬁndings
demonstrate that abrogation of Nrf2-induced target gene
expressions, which represent the adaptive oxidative stress
response, sensitizes CLL cells to auranoﬁn.
Auranoﬁn-induced ROS increases ER stress, which
contributes to auranoﬁn lethality in CLL cells
Increased ROS levels and perturbation in the intracellular
redox status increase the levels of unfolded proteins in the ER
and induce ER stress response (UPR; refs. 12, 22, 23). UPR
induces PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2a, which blocks cap-dependent protein translation but allows preferential translation of ATF4 (22). While

with sh-NT cells (P < 0.02).

upregulating chaperone proteins, for example, GRP78, required in restoring the ER function, ATF4 also induces the
prodeath transcriptional regulator CHOP (22, 23). Treatment
with auranoﬁn induced GRP78 levels and increased the mRNA
and protein levels of CHOP (Fig. 6A and B). Importantly,
auranoﬁn treatment, also dose dependently, increased the
ratio of CHOP to GRP78 (Fig. 6B). Cotreatment with the
antioxidant NAC attenuated the expression of ATF4 and CHOP
(Fig. 6C and D), and signiﬁcantly inhibited apoptosis of CLL
cells, as shown above in Fig. 3G and H. We also determined the
effects of treatment with auranoﬁn on the induction of ER
stress-based UPR. In MEC-1 cells, treatment with auranoﬁn
induced the expression levels of p-PERK, the spliced form of
XBP1 (XBP1-s) and CHOP (Fig. 6E). Auranoﬁn treatment also
induced the expression of the ER chaperones GRP78 and

2528

Calreticulin, but not ERp57 (Fig. 6E). In addition, the auranoﬁn-induced effects on these protein expressions were attenuated by cotreatment with NAC. We also determined whether
treatment with hydrogen peroxide would also induce the
expression of GRP78 and CHOP in CLL cells. Treatment with
hydrogen peroxide also induced Nrf2, GRP78, and CHOP levels,
which was associated with an increase in the levels of cleaved
caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig. S6). These results suggest that
the effects of auranoﬁn-induced oxidative response are mimicked by treatment with hydrogen peroxide. We next determined the effects of shRNA-mediated depletion of CHOP in
CLL cells. Knockdown of CHOP by two separate lentivirustransduced CHOP shRNAs, markedly attenuated CHOP
expression in MEC-1 cells (Fig. 6F). This was associated with
an appreciable reduction in auranoﬁn-induced apoptosis in

MEC-1 cells (Fig. 6G). These ﬁndings demonstrate that auranoﬁn-induced ROS also leads to induction of a lethal ER
stress, associated with increase in the ratio of CHOP to GRP78
in CLL cells, whereas abrogation of auranoﬁn-induced CHOP
levels partially undermines anti-CLL activity of auranoﬁn.

response (13, 14, 41). Data presented in Fig. 7A are representative of the results obtained in three similarly treated separate
samples of primary CLL cells, which show that treatment with
auranoﬁn appreciably increased poly-Ub proteins in primary
CLL cells. Cotreatment with NAC inhibited this accumulation.
Auranoﬁn-induced accumulation of poly-Ub proteins was associated with decreased binding of hsp90 to HDAC6, HSF1, and
p97 in CLL cells (Fig. 7B). Auranoﬁn treatment led to a marked
depletion of HDAC6 levels through degradation by the proteasome, which was associated with the hyperacetylation of hsp90,
detected by immunoblotting with an anti-acetylated-K69 hsp90
antibody (Fig. 7C; ref. 17). Confocal immunoﬂuorescence

analysis showed that auranoﬁn treatment increased the nuclear
localization of HSF1, consistent with the disruption of its
binding to hsp90 (Fig. 7D). This was also associated with the
induction of the levels of HSPs hsp27, hsp40, and hsp70 (Fig. 7E).
By inducing hyperacetylation and inhibition of chaperone
function of hsp90, treatment with auranoﬁn also dose dependently depleted the intracellular levels of the CLL relevant,
progrowth and prosurvival hsp90 client proteins ZAP70, c-RAF,
and AKT (Fig. 7F; refs. 18, 19, 25). Their decline was due to
degradation by the proteasome because cotreatment with the
proteasome inhibitor carﬁlzomib restored the levels of these
client proteins (Fig. 7G).

Discussion
Recently, treatment with auranoﬁn was discovered to inhibit
TrxR and induce ROS in E. histolytica trophozoites, which was
associated with high in vitro an in vivo potency of auranoﬁn
against E. histolytica, and auranoﬁn was granted orphan drug
status by the FDA (42). With the goal of potential repurposing of
auranoﬁn for the treatment of CLL, our preclinical studies
presented here demonstrate that auranoﬁn also inhibits TrxR
and induces ROS in the cultured and primary CLL cells. Here, we
also show for the ﬁrst time that treatment with auranoﬁn
induces lethal oxidative and linked to it, proteotoxic and ER
stress-based UPR responses in CLL cells. In addition, auranoﬁn
treatment is selectively lethal to primary CLL cells, while
sparing the CD34þ normal progenitor and B cells. This may
be due to previously documented higher levels of ROS and Nrf2
levels/activity in the primary CLL versus normal B cells, which
render CLL cells more sensitive to augmented oxidative stress
due to auranoﬁn-induced ROS levels (11). Furthermore, cotreatment with NAC abrogated the lethal activity of auranoﬁn.
Previous reports indicated that redox-active compounds,
including those containing a-b unsaturated carbonyls, isothiocyanates, arsenic trioxide, and ON01910.Na, that induce ROS
and Nrf2 activity are also lethal against CLL cells (5, 11, 43).
Auranoﬁn treatment was also effective in inducing apoptosis in CLL cells exhibiting the biologic and genetic features
associated with poor clinical outcome, including high expression of ZAP70, unmutated IGHV genes, and acquired chromosomal abnormalities such as deletion 17p13 and deletion
11q22. Our ﬁndings also demonstrate that the in vitro coculture
with stromal cells reduces auranoﬁn-induced apoptosis in
MEC-1 cells, which has been attributed to reduced "apoptotic
priming," deﬁned as the proximity of a cell to the apoptotic
threshold measured by a functional assay that assesses mitochondrial depolarization in response to BH3-only peptides
(30, 44). However, auranoﬁn treatment retained the ability to
dose dependently exert lethal activity against CLL cells despite
coculture with NLCs. Furthermore, the capacity to markedly
reduce the in vivo CLL cell burden in the TCL-1 mouse model
supports the conclusion that auranoﬁn treatment overcomes
the protective effects of stroma not only in vitro, but also in the
in vivo setting.
IPA analysis of genes differentially expressed in response to
auranoﬁn identiﬁed ﬁve signiﬁcantly perturbed biologic networks with high signiﬁcance scores, including free radical

scavenging, cellular compromise, and protein degradation.
These ﬁndings underscore that auranoﬁn-induced oxidative
stress and transcriptional activity of Nrf2 play a key role in
eliciting the stress-adaptive responses in auranoﬁn-treated CLL
cells. Nrf2 activity led to increased expression levels of HMOX-1
and GCLM, as well as increase in the ER stress-based UPRassociated CHOP levels. It is noteworthy that auranoﬁn strikingly induced GCLM, HMOX-1, and CHOP levels in primary CLL
cells with or without the deletion of chromosome 17p. As
described in AML cells (45), we found that knockdown of the
levels and/or activity of HMOX-1 synergistically enhanced
auranoﬁn-induced apoptosis of CLL cells. Cotreatment with
BSO also synergistically increased auranoﬁn-induced apoptosis
due to upregulation of GCLM levels and GCL activity, thereby
abrogating the protective effects mediated by auranoﬁninduced GSH. Cotreatment with auranoﬁn and BSO is likely
to have even greater efﬁcacy in overcoming the prosurvival
effects of stromal microenvironment in vitro and in vivo, given
that stromal cells mediate this effect by helping elevate the
intracellular levels of GSH in CLL cells (30). Previous reports
have demonstrated that loss of TrxR activity renders transformed cells especially susceptible to GSH deprivation (46).
Increased oxidative stress caused by simultaneous inhibition of
GSH and thioredoxin metabolism has also been shown to
sensitize cancer cells to other therapeutic agents (47, 48).
By inducing ROS levels and oxidative stress, auranoﬁn treatment concomitantly induced ER stress response, highlighted by
elevated levels of p-PERK, XBP1-s, and CHOP, as well as
increase in the levels of GRP78 and calreticulin. Although
auranoﬁn-mediated increase in GRP78 levels would be protective, a protracted greater elevation in CHOP relative to GRP78
levels could have lethal consequences (24). Protracted CHOP
induction is known to mediate apoptosis, mainly attributed to
induction of BIM with simultaneous inhibition of BCL2 and
MCL1 levels (22). Findings presented here demonstrating that
the shRNA-mediated knockdown of CHOP modestly inhibits
auranoﬁn-induced apoptosis suggest that auranoﬁn-induced
ER stress is a secondary response to auranoﬁn-induced ROS
that can amplify the cell death pathway, rather than being a
mediator of it in CLL cells. Auranoﬁn-induced increase in the
levels of poly-Ub proteins led to hyperacetylation and inhibition
of chaperone function of hsp90. The resulting depletion in the
levels of HDAC6, ZAP70, AKT, and c-RAF would also increase
the apoptotic priming as well as attenuate growth and reduce
the survival of CLL cells. Collectively, our ﬁndings underscore
that auranoﬁn-induced oxidative stress is also linked to proteotoxic and ER stress-based UPR, which could amplify the
lethal effects of auranoﬁn in CLL cells.
Research on phosphine gold compounds for elucidating
their full range of biologic activity and therapeutic potential
is ongoing (31, 42). Findings presented here point toward a
repurposing potential for auranoﬁn in the treatment of CLL. To
this end, under the umbrella of an FDA-approved Investigational New Drug, a clinical trial of auranoﬁn in treatmentrefractory CLL, is underway (4).
