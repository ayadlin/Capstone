Abstract
Histone deacetylases (HDAC) that regulate gene expression are being explored as cancer therapeutic targets.
In this study, we focused on HDAC6 based on its ability to inhibit cancerous Hsp90 chaperone activities by
disrupting Hsp90/p23 interactions. To identify novel HDAC6 inhibitors, we used a dual-luciferase reporter
system in cell culture and living mice by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). On the basis of existing knowledge, a
library of hydrazone compounds was generated for screening by coupling cinnamic hydroxamates with
aldehydes and ketones. Potency and selectivity were determined by in vitro HDAC proﬁling assays, with further
evaluation to inhibit Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions by BLI. In this manner, we identiﬁed compound 1A12 as a
dose-dependent inhibitor of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions, UKE-1 myeloid cell proliferation, p21waf1 upregulation, and acetylated histone H3 levels. 1A12 was efﬁcacious in tumor xenografts expressing Hsp90(a)/p23
reporters relative to carrier control–treated mice as determined by BLI. Small animal 18F-FDG PET/CT
imaging on the same cohort showed that 1A12 also inhibited glucose metabolism relative to control subjects.
Ex vivo analyses of tumor lysates showed that 1A12 administration upregulated acetylated-H3 by approximately 3.5-fold. Taken together, our results describe the discovery and initial preclinical validation of a novel
selective HDAC inhibitor. Cancer Res; 74(24); 7475–86. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Histone acetylation is one of the most important posttranslational modiﬁcations involved in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. In mammalian cells, histone acetylation and deacetylation are mediated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases
(HDAC). In addition to histone proteins, HDACs also regulate
the activities of transcription factors such as MyoD, MYC,
and the estrogen receptor-a, as well as other cell circuitry
proteins such as a-tubulin and Hsp90 (1). HDACs have

emerged as targets for anti-cancer therapy because of the
plethora of cellular processes they regulate, including cell
growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (2). HDACs are classiﬁed as subfamilies class I HDAC1-3 and HDAC8; class II
HDAC4-7, 9, and 10; class III (NADþ-dependent) Sirtuins, and
class IV that includes only HDAC11 (1, 3, 4).
Different classes of small-molecule inhibitors have been
developed to selectively or nonselectively inhibit HDACs,
including suberanoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), sodium butyrate (SB), LBH589, and LAQ824. Many investigational HDACs are undergoing phase I/II clinical trials for
patients with advanced cancers (5), and already two HDAC
inhibitors (HDACi) have been approved for human use by
the FDA (vorinostat and romidespin), for patients with
advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (6–9). HDACis are
also being evaluated in combination with other chemotherapy and targeted agents, including DNA-damaging agents,
inhibitors of methyltransferases, topoisomerases, kinases,
and the proteasome (10, 11).
The present cellular measurements of HDAC function, used
in the study and development of HDACis, are largely limited to
the assessment of substrate acetylation or the upregulation of
target genes such p21waf1 (8, 12–17). Longitudinal kinetic
studies for monitoring the efﬁcacies of HDACi alone cannot
readily be achieved without sacriﬁcing laboratory animals at
each time point before excision of tumors for ex vivo analyses.
Hsp90 is an abundant cytosolic chaperone protein that
facilitates client protein folding and function. Hsp90 has

emerged as a compelling target for therapeutic development
owing to the large number of oncoprotein clients, including
BCR-ABL, HER2, estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, and
others (18–20). Prior research identiﬁed Hsp90 as a substrate
of HDAC6 inhibition (21). Inhibition of HDAC6 by class IIa
HDACi leads to hyperacetylation of Hsp90 and prevents
it from interacting with p23 and its client proteins (18–20).
In cell culture studies, combination of Hsp90 inhibitors (Hsp90i)
and HDACis also led to enhanced inhibition of cancer
growth and induction of apoptosis in some leukemia and breast
cancer models in cell culture studies (4, 20), thus supports
the notion of combining of Hsp90i and HDACi for cancer
treatment. Beyond positive regulation through ATP binding,
interactions between Hsp90(a/b) and p23 are negatively regulated by acetylation of Hsp90(a/b) (21–23). Thus, Hsp90
(a/b)/p23 interactions can be simultaneously targeted both
directly (Hsp90is) and indirectly (HDACis) by combining two
different classes of inhibitors. Toward this objective, we undertook to devise a noninvasive imaging strategy to monitor the
function of Hsp90 as modulated by HDAC inhibition, allowing the discovery of Hsp90 acetylating novel small molecules.
We ﬁrst harnessed the power of multimodality molecular
imaging to evaluate the HDAC selectivity at cellular level.
Using genetically encoded split Renilla luciferase (RL) reporters, we have noninvasively monitored isoform-selective
interactions between Hsp90(a/b) and the co-chaperone p23
in intact 293T human kidney cancer cells in cell culture and
repetitively in living mice by optical bioluminescence imaging (BLI; ref. 24). We have recently used this system for
successful evaluation and validation of a novel class of
Hsp90is in living mice (25). In this report, we used our
Hsp90(a/b)/p23 split reporter system to indirectly monitor
the efﬁcacy of different classes of HDACi in intact cells (Fig.
1A). We have designed and synthesized a focused smallmolecule HDACi library by direct coupling of a potent and
HDAC-biased pharmacophore intermediate to a library of
diverse aldehydes and ketones, to diversify compounds using
a highly efﬁcient chemical methodology developed previously by our groups (3). We then performed comparative
dose-ranging biochemical assays to study target selectivity
in a miniaturized format (Supplementary Table S1) and
cellular assays for disruption of Hsp90 function using our
BLI system. These efforts led to discovery of a novel HDAC
inhibitor 1A12. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the lead
compound 1A12 in disruption of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 by BLI
and its inhibition of glucose metabolism in tumor xenografts
of small animals by 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging and upregulation of HDAC biomarkers by ex vivo analyses.

minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1%
P/S solutions, and 30 mg/mL puromycin hydrochloride. NRL'
refers to the N-terminal portion of RL (amino acid residues
1–229) and "CRL" refers to the C-terminal portion of RL
(amino acid residues 230–311). M185V refers to the mutation in NRL that led to increase in light output (31).

combination with Hsp90i in disruption of
Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions in intact cells in cell
culture
To determine the effect of different classes of HDACi
alone and in combination with geldanamycin-based and
purine-scaffold Hsp90is on Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions in
intact cells, 3.5  104 293T and 3  104 MCF-7 cells stably
expressing the split RL reporters were plated in each well in
the 96-well black wall clear bottom plate (Costar) and
allowed to attach for 24 hours, before treatment with
different concentrations of HDACi (TSA, APHA8, Valproic
acid, Tubacin, and WT161) alone and in combination with
geldanamycin-based (17-DMAG, 4 mmol/L) and purine-scaffold (PU-H71, 0.25 mmol/L) Hsp90is for 24 hours. Fifty
microliter of EnduRen Live Cell Substrate (10 mg/mL DMSO
stock diluted in complete cell culture medium) was added to
each well for 1.5 hours (ﬁnal concentration of 10 mmol/L),
before measurement of RL activities was determined by BLI
(1 minute f1 stop medium binning). Viable cell number in
each well was determined by Alamar Blue assay. Complemented RL activities were normalized for viable cell numbers and to that of cells treated with carrier controls.

Figure 1. Monitoring of the efﬁcacies of HDACi using the Hsp90(a/b)/p23 split RL reporter system. A, schematics of the split RL reporter system. The two
interacting proteins p23 and Hsp90(a/b) were fused to the "NRL" (aa 1–229 with a M185V mutation to increase light output) and "CRL" (aa 230–311)
portion of the RL through a peptide linker, respectively (top). In the presence of ATP, interactions between p23/Hsp90 brought "NRL" and "CRL" in
close proximity and led to complementation of RL enzyme activities, and photon production in the presence of the substrate coelentarazine or
Enduren. RL activities were measured by optical BLI of intact cells in cell culture and in living mice using a cooled CCD camera using Enduren and
coelentarazine, respectively. Inhibition of HDAC activities by HDACi leads to hyperacetylation of Hsp90 by histone acetyl-transferase (HAT). This
modiﬁcation of Hsp90(a/b) leads to disruption of its interaction with p23 and thus reduced complemented RL activities and photon production. B–D,
disruption of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions by pan-HDACi in cell culture. 293T cells stably expressing Hsp90(a/b)/p23 split RL reporters were treated with
different concentrations of pan-HDACi TSA (B), VPA (C), and APHA compound 8 (D) or their respective carrier controls for 24 hours. Complemented RL
activities were determined by BLI of intact cells 90 minutes upon addition of the RL substrate Enduren using a cooled CCD camera (left). Viable cell
number in each well was determined by SRB assay. Bioluminescence signals at each inhibitor concentration were normalized to cells number and to
carrier control (right).

cells stably expressing Hsp90(a/b)/p23 split RL reporters
and FL-eGFP [293T(a/b)-FG] cells in 7-week-old female
nude mice (Charles River) were performed as described
previously (25). Baseline RL activities in the implanted
tumors in living mice were determined by i.v. injection of
30 mg coelenterazine (diluted in 150 mL of PBS) and image
acquisition of 3 minutes at f1 stop medium binning. After a
30-minute wait for RL signals to decay, baseline FL activities
were determined by i.v. injection of 163 mg of D-luciferin in
100 mL PBS with image acquisition of 10 sequences (f1
medium binning, 15 seconds) each to obtain the peak signals
(average radiance). One set of mice was intraperitoneally (i.
p.) injected with 50 mg/kg of 1A12 dissolved in 10% DMSO:
90% b-cyclodextran in a ﬁnal volume of 150 mL (N ¼ 4 per
group). Another set of mice was treated with equal volume of
10% DMSO: 90% b-cyclodextran as a carrier control (N ¼ 4).
At different time points after treatment, follow-up RL and FL
imaging was performed to monitor the effects of the 1A12 on

www.aacrjournals.org

Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions and viable cell numbers, respectively. Average radiance of RL was divided by that of
FL signals at each time point, before normalization to that of
time 0 hour for each individual mouse, and expressed as
average radiance  SEM.
Mice were euthanized after the last imaging time points, and
tumors were excised and homogenized in tissue extraction
buffer in the presence of Halt Complete Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitors (Pierce). The expression of p21waf1, acetylated
H3, Hsp70, and a-tubulin was determined by Western blotting.
Data analysis
Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and
results were expressed as mean  SEM. Statistical differences
were determined by the Student t test and mixed-effect model
using P < 0.05 as cutoff point. Please see Supplementary
Methods for more details on determining the effect of 1A12
on Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions.

Results

for the decrease in RL signals due to the decrease in viable
cell numbers, RL signals (left) ﬁrst were ﬁrst normalized for
viable cell number and then to carrier control–treated cells
(right). Different pan-HDACi and HDAC6-speciﬁc inhibitors
led to different levels of inhibition of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions ranging from 35% to 85%, whereas the HDAC1-3–
speciﬁc inhibitor MS-275 did not lead to signiﬁcant inhibition of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions relative to carrier control–treated cells (Fig. 1B–D). Thus, our system is speciﬁc for
noninvasive monitoring of nonselective and HDAC6-selective
inhibitors in intact cells.

Disruption of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interaction by
HDAC6-speciﬁc and nonselective HDACis
To determine the feasibility and speciﬁcity of using
our split RL reporter system for monitoring the efﬁcacies
of different classes of HDACi in inhibition of Hsp90a/
p23 and Hsp90b/p23 interactions, 293T cells stably expressing Hsp90(a/b)/p23 split RL reporters were treated with
nonselective HDACis TSA, HDAC1,2,3-selective MS-275
(Fig. 2A), and the HDAC6-selective inhibitor WT161
(Fig. 2B, compound structure shown in Fig. 4A) or their
respective carrier controls for 24 hours. BLI of Hsp90
(a/b)/p23 interactions in intact cells was performed
upon addition of the RL substrate Enduren as previously
described (25).
Inhibition of HDAC6 activities by class IIa and nonselective
HDACi should lead to hyperacetylation of Hsp90(a/b)-CRL
by histone acetyltransferase and thus reduces the complementation between NRL-p23 and Hsp90(a/b)/-CRL fragments and subsequent light output (Fig. 1A). To account

Hsp90is bind to the N-terminal ATP binding pocket of
Hsp90 and directly disrupt Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions
(32), whereas HDAC6-active inhibitors indirectly disrupt interactions via inhibition of Hsp90(a/b) deacetylation (33).
We hypothesized that combination of Hsp90 and HDACis

would lead to additive effects in inhibition of Hsp90(a/b)/p23
interactions, which can be simultaneously monitored by our
split reporter complementation system. To test our hypothesis,
we used the prototypical HDAC6-speciﬁc inhibitor Tubacin
(29, 30), which inhibits proliferation, alters microtubules
dynamics, induces apoptosis, and sensitizes cancer cells to
chemotherapy agents (21, 34–38). To determine if Hsp90
inhibitors enhance the efﬁcacy of Tubacin in disruption of
Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions, 293T cells stably expressing
the Hsp90(a/b)/p23 split reporter system were treated with
Tubacin alone or in combination with PU-H71 (200 nmol/L)
or 17-DMAG (1 mmol/L). BLI was performed 24 hours after
treatment as before. Niltubacin, the inactive analogue of
Tubacin, was used as a negative control.
As shown in Fig. 2C and D, Tubacin in combination with
PU-H71 led to greater disruption of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interaction, as shown by the further reduction in bioluminescence
signals relative to cells treated with Tubacin alone. On the
other hand, the control compound Niltubacin had no effect
on Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interaction alone and did not enhance
the efﬁcacy of PU-H71 at the doses tested, relative to carrier
control–treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similar results were seen with another Hsp90i 17-DMAG in 293T
cells (Supplementary Figs. S1B and S2) and in MCF-7 cells
that express the Hsp90(a/b)/p23 split RL reporters (data not
shown).
To conﬁrm that the decrease in BLI (Figs. 1 and 2)
correlates with the inhibition of HDAC6, the expression of
p21waf1, acetylated histone H3 (acet-H3), and acetylated
a-tubulin (standard biomarkers of HDAC6 inhibition) in
cells treated with different HDACis was determined by
Western blotting (Fig. 3). Normalization to a-tubulin shows
that the expression of acetylated a-tubulin was upregulated
in cells treated with non-selective HDAC and HDAC6-speciﬁc inhibitors, but not in cells treated with the HDAC1-3
inhibitor MS-275, Niltubacin, or carrier controls. Treatment

with HDACis also led to increased acetylation of H3, as
expected. Thus, our reporter system was speciﬁc for monitoring inhibition of HDAC6 activities in intact cells through
indirect imaging of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interaction.
Discovery of novel HDAC6 inhibitors through indirect
monitoring of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions in intact
cells
In our previous study, we developed a convergent synthetic platform to establish a hydrazone library that enabled
us to identify the selective HDACis, provide structure activity relationship (SAR), and discovered a pan-HDAC inhibitor
pandacostat (3). Encouraged by this discovery, we further
coupled para- and meta-cinnamic hydroxamates that are
HDAC recognition-binding warheads with more than 384
commercially available aldehydes (Supplementary Fig. S3A)
and ketones using the hydrazone formation chemistry (Fig.
4A) by coupling hydrazide directly to aldehydes and ketone
in DMSO in a 96-well plate format, and generated a focused
library of cinnamic hydroxamates with the structure diversity on the hydrazone end to explore the effect of cap space
on the inhibition of HDAC activities (Fig. 4A). All compounds
were proﬁled with an in vitro ﬂuorogenic HDAC assays (3)
using puriﬁed proteins (HDACs 1–9) to conﬁrm the activities
and selectivity against HDACs 1–9 (Supplementary Fig. S3B
and S3C and Supplementary Table S1). The 384 compounds
were further evaluated for their ability to disrupt Hsp90
(a/b)/p23 interactions in intact cells. 293T cells stably
expressing Hsp90a/p23 or Hsp90b/p23 split RL reporters
were treated with each of 384 compounds at 4.5 mmol/L or
carrier control for 24 hours, before RL imaging as before.
Cells treated with WT161 (10 mmol/L) and PU-H71 (5 mmol/L)
served as positive controls for HDAC and Hsp90 inhibition,
respectively.
Figure 4B shows various degrees of inhibition of RL signals
by 72 of the 384 compounds (rows A–F, columns 1–12) on
Hsp90a/p23 interactions, relative to carrier control–treated
cells. WT161, a HDAC6-selective inhibitor (Fig. 4A), and PUH71 both led to decrease in RL signals, as expected. Similar
results were seen for 293T cells stably expressing Hsp90b/p23
split RL reporters (data not shown). RL signals in each well
were normalized for viable cell number and to carrier control.
Out of the 384 compounds we synthesized and tested, three
compounds 2H9, 2C2, and 1A12 (Fig. 5A) led to the highest level
of inhibition of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interaction (>42%). To compare the efﬁcacy of these three compounds with that of WT161,
all three hits were re-synthesized and tested with 293T cells
expressing the split RL reporters for 24 hours treatment (Fig.
5B). RL signals were normalized for viable cell number in each
well. Figure 5C shows that 1A12 was more effective than 2C2
and 2H9 in inhibition of Hsp90a/p23 interactions (left). 1A12,
2C2, and WT161 led to similar inhibition of Hsp90b/p23
interactions (right). The efﬁcacy of 1A12 was also similar to
that of WT161 in disruption of both Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions, whereas 2H9 was the least effective compound.
Our results indicate that 1A12 is most effective against HDAC1
(IC50 ¼ 0.2 nmol/L), followed by HDAC3 (IC50 ¼ 1.4 nmol/L)
and HDAC6 (IC50 ¼ 1.7 nmol/L). 1A12 also inhibits HDACs 2, 4,

respectively. Cells treated with

inhibitors appeared to be more selective for inhibition of
Hsp90a/p23 interactions (Fig. 5C, left), relative to Hsp90b/
p23 interactions (right).
To validate the mechanisms of lead compounds in inhibition of HDAC activities, 293T cells expressing Hsp90
(a/b)/p23 split RL reporters were treated with different
concentrations of 2H9, 1A12, and 2C2 or carrier control for
24 hours. WT161 (30 mmol/L) and PU-H71 (5 mmol/L) served
as positive controls for inhibition of HDAC6 and Hsp90
activities, respectively. The expression of p21waf1, acet-H3,
and Hsp70 was determined by Western blotting. Figure 5D
shows 2H9, 1A12, and 2C2 led to dose-dependent increases in
expression of p21waf1, acet-H3, and Hsp70 in 293T cells stably
expressing the Hsp90a/p23 sensor, relative to carrier control–treated cells. WT161 also led to upregulation of p21 and
acet-H3. PU-H71 led to increased expression of Hsp70 and
p21waf-1 as expected [35], without affecting the levels of AcetH3. Normalization to a-tubulin shows that 2C2, 1A12, 2H9,
and WT161 led to increased expression of acet-H3 and
p21waf-1 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Similar results were observed for that of 293T cells stably expressing a Hsp90

(a/b)/p23 sensor. In agreement with the RL imaging of
Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions (Fig. 5C), 1A12 was the most
potent compound in upregulation of the expression of
p21waf1 and acet-H3, followed by 2C2 and 2H9.
To further determine if the observed effects of 1A12 on
inhibition of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions and glucose
metabolism was due to inhibition of HDAC activities, we
synthesized a methyl ester analogue of 1A12 (Methyl 3-(4((E)-2-((Z)-2-bromo-3-phenylallylidene) hydrazinecarbonyl)
phenyl)propanoate, abbreviated as 1A12-ME). It is well
known that hydroxamate is the binding head for HDAC
(39, 40); therefore, we expected that 1A12-ME with the
methyl ester will not bind to HDAC6 or inhibits its activity
due to lack of a double bond in the COHOH position.
To determine the speciﬁcity of 1A12-ME on inhibition of
HDAC6, as well as HDAC1 and HDAC3, in vitro deacetylases
assays were performed. Compared with SAHA, 1A12-ME had
no effect on HDAC1, 3, and 6 activities except at the highest
concentration tested (5 and 10 mmol/L; Supplementary
Fig. S5A). On the other hand, the IC50 for 1A12 for inhibition
of HDAC6 was 1.7 nmol/L (Supplementary Table S1). 1A12ME also did not lead to upregulation of HDAC biomarkers

tran or equal volume of carrier control (10% DMSO:90%
b-cyclodextran) via i.p. injections for two days after imaging
(four doses total). Mice were reimaged for RL and FL signals
at 15 hours after the ﬁrst dose, and 41 hours after two more
doses of treatment.
Figure 6A shows the RL signals (i.e., Hsp90(a/b)/p23
interactions) in mice decreased at 15 hours after 1A12 treatment, but increased in mice treated with the same volume of
carrier control (top left). To determine the effect of 1A12 on
viable cell number, FL imaging was performed after RL
imaging at each time point. To account for effect of viable
cell numbers by 1A12 on Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions,
we normalized the RL signals to that of FL signals for each
time point, and to time 0 hour for each mouse. A mixedeffects model was used to account for random variation
between mice in these repeated measure experiments (see
Supplementary Methods). Figure 6B shows that 1A12 led to
net decrease in Hsp90a/p23 interactions (RL/FL ratios) in

384-compound library. To noninvasively monitor the efﬁcacy of the compound in HDAC inhibition and viable cell
numbers in living mice, we introduced a second reporter
(FL-eGFP) into the 293T cell stably expressing Hsp90
(a/b)/p23 sensors as previously described (25). FL was used
to determine viable cell number, which increases as the
cells proliferate and decreases when the cells die upon
treatment with HDACis. The efﬁcacy of 1A12 in disruption
of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions was monitored by RL imaging upon tail-vein injection of coelentarazine. The effects of
these compounds on viable cell number were subsequently
monitored by FL imaging upon tail-vein injection of D-luciferin, because the two substrates do not cross-react (41). We
have previously determined that 50 mg/kg 1A12 was insufﬁcient for upregulation of the acetylated tubulin in tumor
xenografts (data not shown). Baseline RL and FL signals
were determined by sequential BLI imaging before treatment with 80 mg/kg of 1A12 in 10% DMSO:90% b-cyclodex-

Molecular Imaging Led to Discovery of Novel HDAC Inhibitors

Monitoring downstream effects of 1A12 by 18F-FDG
uptake by small animal PET imaging
In addition to determining the efﬁcacy of 1A12 in disruption of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions by BLI (Fig. 6), we also
monitored its downstream effects on glucose metabolism in
the same cohort of living mice by small animal 18F-FDG
PET/CT imaging. 18F-FDG PET/CT has been routinely used
for repetitive and noninvasive monitoring of chemotherapy
responses both in small animals and in human. The short
radioactive half-life (110 minutes) of 18F (42) also permits
repetitive imaging for before and after 1A12 treatment.
Baseline 18F-FDG uptake in tumor-bearing mice was determined before and after 1A12 treatment. The percentage
mean ID/g tissue of 18F-FDG uptake was calculated using
the OSEM2D method upon normalization of injected dose
(43), and the percentage change at day 2 relative to day 0 was
determined for each tumor site.
In carrier control–treated mice, relative to time 0 hour,
the mean increase in percent ID/g of 18F-FDG uptake
in 293T tumors expressing Hsp90(a/b)/p23 RL reporters
(N ¼ 10) was 181  37% (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, mean
change in percent ID/g of 18F-FDG uptake in 1A12-treated
tumors (N ¼ 8) decreased by 64  23% (P < 0.01 relative
to carrier control–treated mice). Therefore, in addition to
inhibition of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions, 1A12 also inhibits glucose metabolism in tumor xenografts in living mice.
To conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of 1A12 and 2C2 as an HDAC
inhibitor in mice, tumors were excised from the mice after
the last imaging time point, and the expression of p21waf1
and act-H3 was determined by Western blotting. Quantitation of the images shows that 1A12 led to upregulation
of acet-H3 by about 3.5-fold in 293T xenografts (P < 0.05)
but did not signiﬁcantly change the level of p21waf-1
(P > 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S8). Our results conﬁrm the
efﬁcacy of 1A12 as a HDACi, both in cell culture and in living
mice.

Discussion
Hydroxamic acids have been used as HDACs inhibitors in
a variety of compounds due to their ability to bind to zinc
within the catalytic pocket of HDACs. Here, we have further
investigated the potent cinnamic hydroxamate pharmacophore that previously led to our discovery of the ﬁrst truly
nonselective HDACi (pandacostat; ref. 3), with an objective of
identifying cell-permeable HDACis capable of disrupting
Hsp90 function. Encouraged by these exciting ﬁndings, the
library has been further expanded by condensation of paraand meta-hydrazide with variety of aldehydes or ketones
(Fig. 4A). The resulted library was evaluated by enzymatic

up for in vivo evaluation.
In the current work, we successfully incorporated multimodality molecular imaging into a discovery platform to
identify novel cinnamic hydroxamates-based HDACis.
We accomplished our goals of monitoring HDAC6 activities
via BLI of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions in intact cells. Upon
validating the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of our system
with known HDACi, we focused our efforts on screening
our custom-synthesized compound library and discovered
that the meta-cinnamic hydroxamate derivatives, such as
the lead compound 1A12, have shown efﬁcacy in disruption
of Hsp90a/p23 interactions. We have also noninvasively
and repetitively monitored the inhibitory effects of 1A12
in 293T tumor xenografts in living mice on Hsp90a/p23
interactions by BLI (Fig. 6) and glucose metabolism
by 18F[FDG] PET/CT (Fig. 7) and validated its mechanism
as an HDACi by ex vivo analyses (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Chan et al.

Because the HDAC I selective inhibitors, such as MS275,
did not provide the same effect on inhibition of Hsp90
(a/b)/p23 interactions (Figs. 2A and 3), we proposed the
effects on inhibition of glucose metabolism (Fig. 7) we
observed in tumor xenografts in mice were in part due to
HDAC6 inhibition by 1A12.
Speciﬁcity of 1A12 as a novel hydroxamate-based
HDACi
We conﬁrmed HDAC6 as one of the targets of 1A12 and
examined its efﬁcacy as an HDACi in cell culture. 1A12 led
to dose-dependent decreases in Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions with corresponding increases in the levels standard
HDAC biomarkers (Fig. 5). It was more selective for inhibition of BLI signals from Hsp90a/p23 interactions, relative
to Hsp90a/p23 interactions in a dose-dependent manner.
We have performed short-term experiments to determine if
the lead HDACi (1A12) alters FL activities and protein
expression, using the 293T cells that stably express fulllength FL (293T/FL). 293T/FL cells were exposed to 1A12
(30 mmol/L) in different sequences as follow: (i) 1A12 for 1 to
15 minutes before addition of D-luciferin; (ii) D-luciferin for 5
minutes before addition of 1A12; or (iii) simultaneous
addition of D-luciferin with 1A12. We did not observe any
signiﬁcant effect of 1A12 on FL activities in 293T/FL cells
regardless of the sequence of addition (Supplementary Fig.
S6C and data not shown). Similar results were observed in
293T/a-FG and 293T/b-FG cells (data not shown). To
determine the effect of 1A12 on expression of FL protein,
293T/FL cells were exposed to 1A12 (30 mmol/L) for 1 to 15
minutes or for 24 hours at 7.5 to 30 mmol/L before Western
blotting. 1A12 treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter the
expression of FL protein at all the time points and concentrations tested (Supplementary Fig. S6D). In sum, our
results indicated that 1A12 could be used as a second
reporter to account for the change in viable cell number
due to drug treatment. Using an inactive analogue of 1A12
(1A12-ME), we have further conﬁrmed that the biologic
effects of 1A12 were in part due to inhibition of HDAC6
(Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6).
A uniﬁed dual split RL and FL reporter system
accelerated drug discovery, mechanism validation, and
lead optimization in living subjects
Our split reporter assay (Fig. 1A) allows us to speciﬁcally
monitor the interactions between Hsp90(a/b) and p23 in
intact cells, which is negatively regulated by HDAC6. Even
though HDAC6-selective and pan-HDACis can both lead to
disruption of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions, we can monitor
its effect alone and in combination with other Hsp90is on
HDAC6 noninvasively in intact cells. As described in Fig. 2C
and D and Supplementary Fig. S2, we were able to monitor
the combined effect of Hsp90 inhibitors (PU-H71 and
17AAG) with HDACis (Tubacin and WT161) on inhibition
of Hsp90(a/b)/p23 interactions. Given the upregulation
of Hsp90 activities is speciﬁc for cancer cells, the development of HDAC6-selective inhibitors could lead to more
effective combinatorial therapies aimed at targeting both

HDAC6 (directly) and Hsp90 (indirectly). It may also possibly reduce toxicities and off-target effects associated with
pan-HDACis.
We used our Hsp90(a/b)/p23 split RL reporter system
(25) for screening of novel HDACis in cell culture and
subsequently in living mice. Our strategy will allow rapid
evaluation of different structural analogues generated by
medicinal chemistry with better potency and bioavailability. The leads will then be tested in mice and this will
signiﬁcantly reduce the costs of scaling up the syntheses of
compounds. Furthermore, the reporters can be introduced
into speciﬁc cancer cell lines that overexpress HDAC6 (21).
Importance of multimodality molecular imaging for
human clinical translation
Our multimodality molecular imaging platform represents a signiﬁcant advancement in accelerating drug development. The ease, relative low cost, noninvasive and high
sensitivity of BLI allow rapid screening of large chemical
libraries in very small quantities and subsequent SAR studies. Currently, human PET/CT imaging has been used to
monitor tumor progression, evaluation, and response to
therapy (44–46). PET imaging has also been used for preclinical studies for evaluation of the efﬁcacy of different
HDACi in small animal models. For example, the HDAC
inhibitor SAHA was radiolabeled with 18F for PET/CT imaging of ovarian carcinomas treated with SAHA (47), whereas
18
F-FLT PET has been used to monitor the effect of
LAQ824 and PXD101 on cell proliferation in colon carcinomas (48, 49). Using the same cohort of mice for BLI imaging,
we also monitored the inhibition of glucose metabolism
by 1A12 using 18F-FDG (Fig. 7). A multimodality imaging
approach will therefore provide speciﬁc mechanistic and
temporal information pertaining to drug treatment and
identify determinants for response to therapy.
In summary, we have discovered and validated a novel
class of hydroxamate-based HDACis by coupling multimodality molecular imaging to biased chemical library synthesis
and iterative biochemical proﬁling. Our workﬂow allows
rapid identiﬁcation of cell-permeable lead compounds that
can be validated in cell culture followed by monitoring of in
vivo efﬁcacy and downstream effects in living mice. The
results of this study will signiﬁcantly accelerate the development of next generations of therapeutics aimed at inhibiting speciﬁc HDACs.
