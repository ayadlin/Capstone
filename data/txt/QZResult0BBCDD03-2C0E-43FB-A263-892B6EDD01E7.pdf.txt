Abstract

Author Manuscript

Resveratrol possesses a strong anticancer activity exhibited as the induction of apoptosis through
p53 activation. However, the molecular mechanism and direct target(s) of resveratrol-induced p53
activation remain elusive. Here, the Ras-GTPase activating protein SH3 domain binding protein 1
(G3BP1) was identified as a potential target of resveratrol, and in vitro binding assay results using
resveratrol (RSVL)-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads confirmed their direct binding. Depletion of
G3BP1 significantly diminishes resveratrol-induced p53 expression and apoptosis. We also found
that G3BP1 negatively regulates p53 expression by interacting with ubiquitin-specific protease 10
(USP10), a deubiquitinating enzyme of p53. Disruption of the interaction of p53 with USP10 by
G3BP1 interference leads to suppression of p53 deubiquitination. Resveratrol, on the other hand,
directly binds to G3BP1 and prevents the G3BP1/USP10 interaction, resulting in enhanced
USP10-mediated deubiquitination of p53 and consequently increased p53 expression. These
findings disclose a novel mechanism of resveratrol-induced p53 activation and resveratrol-induced
apoptosis by direct targeting of G3BP1.

Introduction
The tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in the regulation of cell cycle, DNA repair,
apoptosis, senescence and angiogenesis (1). The importance of p53 in cancer development is
underscored by the observation that the p53 pathway is frequently inactivated by mutations
or other defects in more than 50% of all human cancers (1, 2). Therefore, p53 is recognized
as a desirable target for cancer prevention and therapy.

Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4’-truhydroxystilbene; RSVL), a natural phytoalexin found in grapes
(3) and peanuts (4, 5), is considered as a potential anticancer agent since its inhibitory
effects on carcinogenic processes (e.g., initiation, promotion and progression) was first
reported in 1997 (6). Resveratrol has been shown to possess an apoptosis-dependent
anticancer activity (7–12), and several groups have demonstrated that the p53 activation is
implicated in resveratrol-induced apoptosis (13–15). However, the molecular mechanism
and direct target(s) of resveratrol-induced p53 expression remain elusive.

Ras-GTPase activating protein SH3 domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1) was first identified
as a protein that interacts with the SH3 domain of Ras-GTPase activating protein (Ras-GAP)
(16) and is known to be involved in several pathways including Ras signaling (16, 17), cmyc mRNA turnover (18, 19), NF-kappaB signaling (20) and HER2 signaling (21). G3BP1
is also overexpressed in several human cancers including head and neck, breast and colon
cancers (21–24). Interestingly, Soncini, et al. (25) discovered the interaction of G3BP1 with
ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10), and they concluded that G3BP1 might restrict the
deubiquitinating activity of USP10. USP10 is known to directly interact with p53 and
specifically deubiquitinate p53, which leads to p53 activation and stabilization (26).
However, no one has reported the function of G3BP1 in mediating USP10-regulated
deubiquitination of p53.
In this study, we identified G3BP1 as a novel target of resveratrol. We also found that
G3BP1 negatively regulates p53 expression by interacting with USP10. G3BP1 binds to
USP10 and therefore disrupts the interaction of USP10 with p53, leading to suppression of
p53 deubiquitination. Resveratrol, on the other hand, directly binds to G3BP1 and disrupts
the G3BP1/USP10 interaction, resulting in enhanced USP10-regulated deubiquitination of
p53. Here, we propose a novel mechanism of resveratrol-induced p53 activation that occurs
through the direct targeting of G3BP1.

Results
Resveratrol interacts with G3BP1 at the NTF2-like domain

Author Manuscript

To identify novel molecular targets of resveratrol-induced p53 expression and apoptosis, we
first screened binding partners for resveratrol by LC-MS/MS analysis and found G3BP1 as a
potential binding protein of resveratrol (Supplemental Table 1). We then performed binding
assays using resveratrol-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads, and confirmed that recombinant
full-length G3BP1 (rG3BP1) and endogenous G3BP1 bound to resveratrol (Fig. 1a). G3BP1
consists of two domains, the NTF2-like domain at the N-terminus and the eukaryotic RNA
recognition motif (RRM) domain at the C-terminal end. To identify which domain is

involved in the binding with resveratrol, we purified the recombinant NTF2-like (residues
1–139) and RRM (residues 339–421) domains of G3BP1, and performed in vitro binding
assays (Fig. 1b). A strong interaction with resveratrol-conjugated beads was observed for the
NTF2-like domain, whereas the RRM domain showed only a weak binding with resveratrolconjugated beads. We concluded that the NTF2-like domain of G3BP1 is critical for
interacting with resveratrol. Because the crystal structure of the NTF2-like domain of
G3BP1 is available, we performed ligand docking. According to our generated binding
model (Fig. 1c), resveratrol forms hydrophobic interactions with G3BP1 at Val11, Phe33
and Phe124, and the hydroxyl group of resveratrol forms a hydrogen bond with the side
chain of Gln18 of G3BP1. To confirm our plausible binding model, we constructed singlepoint mutants of G3BP1, and transfected them into HEK 293 cells. The result of the binding
assay (Fig. 1d) showed that the interaction of G3BP1 with resveratrol was dramatically
decreased by a single-point mutation of G3BP1 at Val11, Phe33 or Phe124, indicating that
these amino acids are essential for resveratrol binding.
G3BP1 plays an important role in resveratrol-induced p53 expression and apoptosis

Author Manuscript

We were interested in revealing the molecular mechanism of resveratrol-induced p53
expression. The expression levels of G3BP1 were therefore determined in various p53
wildtype cancer cell lines, and high expression of G3BP1 was observed in SK-MEL-5
human melanoma skin cells (Supplemental Fig. 1a). Consistent with previous publications
(13–15), resveratrol-induced p53 expression and apoptosis were observed in SK-MEL-5
cells (Supplemental Fig. 1b,c), resulting in inhibition of proliferation (as assessed using the
MTS assay) and anchorage-independent cell growth (Supplemental Fig. 1d,e). Because
G3BP1 was identified as a promising target of resveratrol, we determined whether G3BP1 is
implicated in resveratrol-induced p53 expression. Interestingly, resveratrol-induced p53
expression was dramatically diminished by depletion of G3BP1 in SK-MEL-5 cells (Fig.
2a). The same phenomenon was observed in HCT116 human colon cancer cells that have
mid-level expression of G3BP1 (Supplemental Fig. 1f). Resveratrol-induced apoptosis was
substantially reduced by G3BP1 depletion in both SK-MEL-5 (Fig. 2b) and HCT116 cells
(Supplemental Fig. 1g). Moreover, knocking down G3BP1 expression diminished sensitivity
to resveratrol’s effect on the proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of SK-MEL-5
cells (Fig. 2c,d). The same phenomenon on anchorage-independent growth was observed in
HCT116 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1h). On the other hand, HCT116 cells overexpressing
G3BP1 were more sensitive to resveratrol in the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of
anchorage-independent growth compared with cells expressing the control vector (Fig. 2e,f).
These results strongly indicate that G3BP1 is implicated in resveratrol-induced p53
expression and apoptosis.

G3BP1 negatively regulates p53 expression by inhibiting USP10-mediated deubiquitination
of p53
Our results indicate that resveratrol-induced p53 expression is affected by G3BP1
manipulation. We then examined the role of G3BP1 in regulating p53 expression. The
depletion of G3BP1 obviously increased the protein levels of p53 and p21, a target of p53,
in SK-MEL-5 (Fig. 3a) and HCT116 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2a). HCT116 cells
overexpressing G3BP1, on the other hand, exhibited decreased expression levels of p53 and

p21 compared with cells expressing a control vector (Fig. 3b). Because another G3BP
family protein, G3BP2, was reported to interact with p53 and regulate p53 protein level (27),
we examined the effect of G3BP2 in regulating p53 expression. Less effect on p53 protein
levels was observed in HCT116 cells overexpressing G3BP2 compared with G3BP1
overexpressing cells (Supplemental Fig. 2b). We therefore believe that G3BP1 plays a more
important role in regulating p53 compared to G3BP2. The mRNA levels of p53 and its
target genes, p21 and the p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), were then
determined in G3BP1-manipulated cells. Depletion of G3BP1 dramatically enhanced p21
mRNA level and slightly increased PUMA mRNA levels in SK-MEL-5 cells (Fig. 3c),
indicating that G3BP1-mediated p53 is active as a transcription factor. On the other hand,
p53 mRNA levels were not changed in G3BP1-depleted SK-MEL-5 cells (Fig. 3c).
Furthermore, knocking down G3BP1 expression markedly increased p53 stability (Fig. 3d),
and the reduction of p53 levels by G3BP1 overexpression was reversed by treatment with
the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 3e) in SK-MEL-5 cells, indicating that G3BP1
regulates p53 expression through the proteasome degradation pathway.

Interestingly, using the yeast two-hybrid system, G3BP1 was identified as an USP10
interacting protein (25), and USP10 has been reported as a specific deubiquitinating enzyme
of p53 (26). We therefore hypothesized that G3BP1 might affect USP10-mediated
deubiquitination of p53. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an in vivo ubiquitination
assay using H1299 cells (Fig. 3f). The results showed that G3BP1 had no effect on
ubiquitination of p53 (compare lanes 2 and 3). Because USP10 is a p53 deubiquitinating
enzyme, p53 ubiquitination was decreased by transfection of USP10 (compare lanes 3 and
4), whereas deubiquitination of p53 by USP10 was inhibited by co-transfection of USP10
and G3BP1 (compare lanes 4 and 5). G3BP1 also inhibited USP10-mediated
deubiquitination of endogenous p53 in HCT116 cells (Fig. 3g). Overexpression of G3BP1
enhanced p53 ubiquitination in cells expressing control shRNA (compare lanes 1 and 2).
Depletion of USP10 enhanced p53 ubiquitination (compare lanes 1 and 3), whereas
enhancement of p53 ubiquitination by G3BP1 was not observed in USP10 depleted cells
(compare lanes 3 and 4). Mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2), E3 ubiquitin-protein
ligase, is also known as an important regulator of p53. We therefore determined the
consequence of Mdm2 and G3BP1-mediated p53 regulation. Depletion of G3BP1 has no
significant effect on either Mdm2 protein or mRNA levels (Supplemental Fig. 2c,d).
Moreover, the interaction of p53 with Mdm2 was not affected by the manipulation of
G3BP1 (Supplemental Fig. 2e), and no interaction of G3BP1 with Mdm2 was observed in
SK-MEL-5 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2f), indicating that G3BP1-regulated p53 expression is
not dependent on Mdm2. These results suggest that G3BP1 negatively regulates p53
expression by inhibiting USP10-mediated deubiquitination of p53.
G3BP1 disrupts the interaction of USP10 with p53
Using truncated mutants of both G3BP1 and USP10 transfected into HCT116 cells, we
observed that the N-terminal portion of G3BP1 (residues 1–146) interacts with the Nterminus of USP10 (residues 1–100). These data are not shown here because they are
consistent with data presented in two recent publications. The groups reported that the
NTF2-like domain of G3BP1 (residues 1–138) is required for the interaction with USP10

(28) and that the N-terminal region of USP10 (residues 1–76) is critical for interacting with
G3BP1 (29). However, for the first time we show an in vitro interaction of the purified
NTF2-like domain of G3BP1 (residues 1–139) and the N-terminal region of USP10
(residues 1–150). Both proteins were eluted on a gel-filtration column as a single peak
representing a complex (Fig. 4a). In contrast, the RRM domain of G3BP1 and USP10 were
eluted as two separate peaks representing single proteins (data not shown). According to a
previous report (26), the N-terminal region of USP10 (residues 1–100) interacts with p53 to
deubiquitinate p53. We conjectured that G3BP1 disrupts the interaction of USP10 with p53
by binding to USP10, and consequently suppresses USP10-mediated deubiquitination of
p53. The results indicated that overexpression of G3BP1 decreased the USP10/p53
interaction as shown by co-IP assays using USP10 antibodies in HCT116 cells (Fig. 4b).
Consistently, down-regulation of G3BP1 increased the USP10/p53 interaction in SK-MEL-5
cells (Fig. 4c). The same phenomenon was observed using p53 antibodies in a co-IP assay
(Supplemental Fig. 3a). In addition, an in vitro competition assay showed that the in vitro
interaction between USP10 and p53 was clearly decreased in the presence of G3BP1 (Fig.
4d). These results suggest that G3BP1 interrupts the interaction of USP10 with p53 by its
own interaction with USP10.
G3BP1 regulates cancer cell proliferation through p53 and USP10

Author Manuscript

Our results showed that G3BP1 negatively regulates p53 expression by inhibiting USP10mediated p53 deubiquitination. Because p53 plays a critical role in inducing apoptosis,
resulting in inhibition of proliferation in several cancer cell lines, we examined the role of
G3BP1 in various cancer cells. Proliferation (as assessed using the MTS assay) and
anchorage-independent growth were dramatically reduced by depletion of G3BP1 in SKMEL-5 (Fig. 5a) and HCT116 cells (Supplemental Fig. 4a). An enhancement of proliferation
and anchorage-independent growth were observed in G3BP1 overexpressing HCT116 cells
(Fig. 5b). To demonstrate whether G3BP1-regulated cancer cell proliferation is p53
dependent, G3BP1 was manipulated in HCT116 expressing wildtype p53 (p53+/+) and p53
deficient (p53−/−) cells. Depletion of G3BP1 inhibited the proliferation and anchorageindependent growth of HCT116 p53+/+ cells, whereas the effects were significantly reduced
in HCT116 p53−/− cells (Fig. 5c,d). The inhibition of cell proliferation by G3BP1 depletion
was also diminished by double knock-down of G3BP1 and p53 in SK-MEL-5 cells
(Supplemental Fig. 4b). Moreover, overexpression of G3BP1 enhanced proliferation and
anchorage-independent growth of HCT116 p53+/+ cells, whereas these effects were not
observed in HCT116 p53−/− cells (Fig. 5e,f). These results strongly indicated that G3BP1
modulates cancer cell proliferation in a p53-dependent manner. We then determined the
consequence of USP10 in G3BP1-regulated cancer cell proliferation (Fig. 5g).
Overexpression of G3BP1 enhanced proliferation of HCT116 cells expressing control
shRNA. Consistent with a previous report (26), cells expressing USP10 shRNA increased
cell proliferation. However, enhancement of cell proliferation by G3BP1 was not observed
in cells expressing USP10 shRNA. Furthermore, the double knock-down of G3BP1 and
USP10 rescued the inhibition of proliferation induced by G3BP1 depletion in HCT116 (Fig.
5h) and SK-MEL-5 cells (Supplemental Fig. 4c). These results suggest that G3BP1regulated cancer cell proliferation is dependent on USP10 and p53.

Resveratrol enhances USP10-mediated deubiquitination of p53 by disrupting the G3BP1/
USP10 interaction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our results indicate that G3BP1 regulates p53 expression by inhibiting USP10-mediated
deubiquitination of p53. We questioned whether resveratrol mediates G3BP1-induced p53
ubiquitination. Indeed, G3BP1 overexpression dramatically induced p53 ubiquitination, and
resveratrol dose-dependent treatment diminished p53 ubiquitination in HCT116 cells (Fig.
6a). We also conducted an in vivo ubiquitination assay in H1299 cells (Fig. 6b). The results
showed that the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on p53 ubiquitination was not observed in
cells without G3BP1 (compare lanes 3 and 4), but resveratrol strongly inhibited p53
ubiquitination in cells co-transfected with G3BP1 and USP10 (compare lanes 5 and 6),
indicating that resveratrol suppresses G3BP1-induced p53 ubiquitination through USP10.
The mRNA levels of p53 and its target genes were then determined (Fig. 6c). Resveratrol
significantly enhanced p21 and PUMA mRNA levels, whereas p53 mRNA levels were not
affected by resveratrol treatment. Additionally, resveratrol-induced p53 expression was not
observed in cells treated with MG132 (Fig. 6d) or in cells expressing USP10 shRNA (Fig.
6e). To examine a role of Mdm2 in resveratrol-induced p53 expression, the Mdm2 levels
and the interaction of Mdm2 with p53 were analyzed. Mdm2 mRNA levels were slightly
increased by resveratrol treatment but no significant differences were observed
(Supplemental Fig. 5a). Protein levels of Mdm2 were not affected by resveratrol treatment in
SK-MEL-5 or HCT116 cells (Supplemental Fig. 5b). Furthermore, the interaction of Mdm2
and p53 was not changed by resveratrol treatment (Supplemental Fig. 5c), indicating that
Mdm2 is not involved in resveratrol-mediated p53 expression. Our in vitro pull-down assay
data indicated that resveratrol interacted with G3BP1 at the NTF2-like domain, which is the
same region that interacts with USP10. We therefore hypothesized that resveratrol interferes
with the G3BP1/USP10 interaction. To test this hypothesis, we conducted co-IP assays in
the presence or absence of resveratrol. As expected, the interaction between G3BP1 and
USP10 decreased in HCT116 cells treated with resveratrol (Fig. 6f). Interestingly, the
USP10/p53 interaction was increased by treatment with resveratrol. An in vitro competition
assay also showed that resveratrol inhibited the G3BP1/USP10 interaction in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 6g). These results strongly indicate that resveratrol enhances
USP10-mediated deubiquitination of p53 by disrupting the G3BP1/USP10 interaction.
The p53-dependent effect of resveratrol mainly relies on G3BP1

Author Manuscript

Because resveratrol has been reported to induce p53-dependent as well as p53-independent
apoptosis in a certain types of human cancer cells (30), we compared the effect of
resveratrol in HCT116 p53+/+ and p53−/− cells. The effects of resveratrol in inducing
apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation were significantly reduced in HCT116 p53−/− cells
compared with HCT 116 p53+/+ cells (Fig. 7a,b). A similar phenomenon of inhibition of
proliferation was observed in SK-MEL-5 cells by depletion of p53 (Supplemental Fig. 6a).
Although the effect of resveratrol is diminished in p53 depleted or deficient cells, resveratrol
still induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation, indicating resveratrol exerts both p53dependnt and -independent effects. To examine the consequence of G3BP1 in p53dependent effect of resveratrol, G3BP1 was depleted in HCT116 p53−/− or RPMI7951 (a
p53-null human skin malignant melanoma) cells and then cells were treated with resveratrol.

Interestingly, the effect of resveratrol on either inducing apoptosis or inhibiting proliferation
was not affected by depletion of G3BP1 in HCT116 p53−/− (Fig. 7c) and RPMI7951
(Supplemental Fig. 6b) cells. We therefore concluded that the p53-dependent effect of
resveratrol mainly relies on G3BP1. Furthermore, human skin melanoma tissue array
analysis showed that the protein levels of G3BP1 were significantly higher in skin
melanoma tissue compared with normal skin tissue (Fig. 7d), which is consistent with a role
of G3BP1 in promoting cancer cell proliferation. Overall, our study demonstrates that
resveratrol directly targets G3BP1, which in turn prevents the G3BP1/USP10 interaction and
consequently increases USP10-regulated deubiquitination of p53 (Fig. 7e).

Discussion
Author Manuscript

G3BP was first identified in 1996 as a protein that binds to the SH3 domain of RasGAP
(16). G3BP1 has been reported to regulate several pathways involved in cancer biology
including Ras signaling (16, 17). G3BP1 is also reportedly overexpressed in several human
cancers (21–24). Furthermore, a novel peptide, GAP161, was shown to block the expression
of G3BP1 and induce apoptosis in HCT116 cells (31). Therefore G3BP1 is recognized as a
potential target for cancer prevention and therapy. However, a recent report indicated that in
conditions where G3BP1 and RasGAP bind to known partners, no interaction between
G3BP1 and RasGAP was observed (32). The authors also demonstrated that TATRasGAP317–326 does not modulate any of the known G3BP1 functions including modulation
of c-myc mRNA levels and sensitization of cancer cells, which raises the question of G3BP1
function. Thus, the molecular mechanisms explaining G3BP1’s role in cancer development
are not fully understood.

Author Manuscript

G3BP1 binds to USP10 and inhibits the deubiquitination activity of USP10 (25). Because
we discovered that USP10 is a specific deubiquitinating enzyme of p53 (26), we anticipated
that G3BP1 would regulate p53 expression through USP10. As was shown in vitro and in
cells, the NTF2-like domain of G3BP1 interacts with the N-terminal portion of USP10. The
purified recombinant proteins eluted from a gel filtration column as a complex. When
G3BP1 was combined with USP10 at a 2:1 ratio, no single peaks corresponding to
individual proteins were observed. We propose that the resulting high molecular weight
complex was comprised of 2 molecules of USP10 and 4 molecules of G3BP1 because
USP10 was being eluted as a dimer. In this study, we found that G3BP1 enhances the p53
ubiquitination by disrupting the interaction of USP10 with p53, leading to destabilization of
p53. Moreover, G3BP1 regulates cancer cell proliferation through p53 and USP10. Thus, we
have elucidated a novel mechanism explaining the role of G3BP1 in regulating wildtype p53
cancer development.

Author Manuscript

The current study also describes G3BP1 as a novel target of resveratrol. Resveratrol is
known as one of the most promising anticancer agents isolated from natural products. Many
reports have shown that resveratrol possesses an apoptosis-dependent anticancer activity
mediated through p53 activation (7–12). However, no report has elucidated the mechanism
of resveratrol-induced p53 activation. We found that the resveratrol-induced p53 expression
was completely diminished in cells expressing G3BP1 shRNA, and the induction of
apoptosis and suppression of anchorage-independent cell growth by resveratrol were

obviously decreased by down-regulation of G3BP1. As a mechanism of resveratrol-induced
p53 expression, we revealed that resveratrol directly binds to G3BP1 and disrupts the
G3BP1/USP10 interaction, releasing USP10 which in turn results in enhanced USP10mediated deubiquitination of p53. Our results suggest that resveratrol induces p53
expression and apoptosis by directly targeting G3BP1.

Author Manuscript

Early apoptotic cells were increased from 1.9% to 12.8% by G3BP1 depletion in SK-MEL-5
cells (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, in G3BP1-silenced cells, the p53 levels were enhanced to the
levels of p53 in control cells stimulated with 20 µM resveratrol. However, resveratrol
treatment (40 µM) could still induce additional apoptosis in G3BP1-depleted cells from
12.8% to 29.3%. As shown in Fig. 7a, resveratrol-induced apoptosis was significantly
diminished in HCT116 p53−/− cells compared with p53+/+ cells. However, it was not
completely blocked, indicating that resveratrol induced not only p53-dependent apoptosis
but also p53-independent apoptosis. Interestingly, we found the effects of resveratrol were
not affected by G3BP1 depletion in p53 deficient cells (Fig. 7c, Supplemental Fig. 6b).
Although resveratrol could induce p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis, the p53dependent effect of resveratrol mainly relies on G3BP1. Moreover, depletion of G3BP1 had
no effect on proliferation of HCT116 p53−/− (Fig. 5d) or SK-MEL-5 cells expressing p53
shRNA (Supplemental Fig. 4b). However, knocking down G3BP1 expression slightly
increased apoptosis from 10.6% to 12.7% (Fig. 7c) and inhibited anchorage-independent
growth (Fig. 5d) in HCT116 p53−/− cells, suggesting that G3BP1 might have p53independent effect. Because G3BP1 has been reported to regulate several pathways involved
in cancer development including Ras signaling, NF-kappaB signaling and HER2 signaling
(16, 17), those pathways could be implicated in p53-independent effect of G3BP1.

Several groups, including our group, have identified molecular targets of resveratrol such as
leukotriene A4 hydrolase and cyclooxygenase-2 (33, 34). Because resveratrol has multiple
targets, we also determined the binding of resveratrol with G3BP1 related proteins,
including G3BP2, the cytoplasmic poly (A) binding protein (PABP) and NTF2. Results
(Supplemental Fig. 7) indicated that resveratrol also binds to G3BP2 and PABP, but not to
NTF2, suggesting that G3BP2 and PABP also could be targets of resveratrol-induced p53
expression. Our results showed that overexpression of G3BP1 dramatically decreased p53
levels, whereas overexpression of G3BP2 had less effect on p53 expression levels compared
with G3BP1. PABP reportedly regulates p53 translocation to the mitochondria by enhancing
acetylation and phosphorylation of p53, but did not affect p53 protein expression (35). We
therefore conclude that G3BP1 plays a more important role in p53 expression compared to
G3BP2 or PABP. However, the effect of resveratrol on G3BP2 and PABP in cancer
development would be interesting to study.

Melanoma is categorized as the most aggressive form of skin cancer, and the number of
cases worldwide has doubled in the past 20 years (36). The incidence of melanoma has been
increasing at a rate of 6–7% annually and accounts for 75% of deaths from skin cancer. In
the United States, the incidence and mortality of melanoma continues to rise faster than that
of any other cancer (37). Our results showed that G3BP1 is highly expressed in a human

mutation is observed in human melanoma (38–40). This information allows us to conclude
that resveratrol might exert highly beneficial preventive or therapeutics effects against
melanoma. Overall, our study showed that resveratrol induces p53-dependent apoptosis by
directly targeting G3BP1 in p53 wildtype cancers.

Purification of recombinant G3BP1 and USP10

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The NTF2-like (residues 1–139) and RRM (residues 339–421) domains of hG3BP
(NP-005745) were cloned into the pET-28a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). The
NTF2-like domain of G3BP1 was expressed in Codon Plus (DE3) RIPL E.coli (Stratagene)
and then harvested after 2–2.5 h growth at 37°C following induction with 1 mM
isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The RRM domain of G3BP1 was expressed in
BL21 (DE3) E.coli (Novagen). The cells were induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and cultured at
15°C overnight. The N-terminal portion of USP10 (residues 1–150) was cloned into the
pET-28a vector, expressed in BL21 (DE3) E.coli after 2 h of growth at 37°C following
induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. All proteins were purified on HisPur Ni-NTA resin (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using standard procedures. The lysis and washing buffers
were comprised of 30 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), and 10%
glycerol. The proteins were eluted with 200–250 mM imidazole, 150 mM NaCl, and 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The second step of purification was performed on an FPLC system using
a size exclusion column HiLoad™ 16/60 Superdex™ S200 (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA)
equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).
Resveratrol binding assay

Author Manuscript

Resveratrol-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads were prepared as described previously (33).
Recombinant full-length G3BP1 or a whole cell lysate was incubated with resveratrolconjugated or control beads at 4°C overnight in NP-40 lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40 and protease inhibitor]. After washing 5
times with NP-40 lysis buffer, the proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by Western
blotting. Purified recombinant NTF2-like or RRM domain of G3BP1 (400 µg) was
incubated with beads for 30 min at room temperature. The resin was washed 5 times with
buffer [150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)], and then subjected to SDS-PAGE.
Western blotting
Cells were harvested and disrupted with NP-40 lysis buffer. Whole cell lysates were
subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane.
After blocking, the membrane was incubated with a specific primary antibody, and then
protein bands were visualized with the ECL system after hybridization with a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.
Computer modeling

Author Manuscript

The crystal structure of the NTF2-like domain of G3BP1 was obtained from the RCSB
Protein Data Bank, PDB entry 3Q90. The subunit labeled chain A was extracted and used in
docking. Hydrogens were added consistent with pH 7.0 and all water molecules were
removed using the Protein Preparation Wizard in Maestro v9.2. Then the structure was
energy-minimized. The chemical structure of resveratrol was prepared using LigPrep v2.5
and then assigned AMSOL partial atomic charge. The program Glide v5.7 was used for
ligand docking. Flexible Docking was performed with extra precision (XP) mode. The
number of poses per ligand was set to 10 in post-docking minimization and the best 5 poses
were output. The other parameters were kept as default.

Anchorage-independent cell growth assay

Author Manuscript

Cells (8×103 per well) were suspended in basal medium eagle (BME) containing 10% FBS
and 0.33% agar and plated on solidified BME containing 10% FBS and 0.5% agar. After
incubation for 7 days, the colonies were counted under a microscope using the Image-Pro
Plus Software (v.4) program (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD).
Apoptosis assay
Cells (1×105 per well) were seeded in 6-cm dishes and then apoptosis was analyzed by a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) using the Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit (MBL International Corp., Woburn, MA). Cells stained by Annexin
V but not by propidium iodide were determined as early apoptotic cells.

Cell proliferation assay
Cells (2×103 per well) were seeded in 96-well plates and then formazan production was
determined using the CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay
(Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This assay is
composed of tetrazolium compound (3-(4,5--dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS) and an
electron-coupling reagent (phenazine methosulfate; PMS). MTS is converted into a
formazan by dehydrogenase found in metabolically active cells, and the quantity of
formazan product is directly proportional to the number of living cells.
Co-immunoprecipitation Assay

Author Manuscript

Whole cell lysates were pre-cleared with protein A/G agarose beads in NP-40 lysis buffer
for 30 min at 4°C and then incubated with 2 µg antibody at 4°C overnight. After incubation
with protein A/G agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C, the immunocomplexes were analyzed by
Western blotting.
In vivo ubiquitination assay
H1299 cells were transfected with HA-Ub, Myc-p53, Flag-USP10 and/or His-G3BP1 for 48
h and then incubated with 10 µM MG132 for 4 h. Whole cell lysates were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Myc, and then analyzed by Western blotting.
In vitro binding assay using size exclusion chromatography

Author Manuscript

The His-tagged proteins, the NTF2-like domain of G3BP1 (residues 1–139) and the Nterminal portion of USP10 (residues 1–150) were purified by a two-step procedure as
described above. They both were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio (~13 nmol) and incubated for 1
h at room temperature. The mixture was loaded onto the Superdex™ 200 10/300 GL column
(25 ml) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl. A small peak
of free USP10 always appeared under these conditions. When G3BP1 was mixed with
USP10 at a 2:1 ratio, no free proteins were eluted (data not shown). Similar experiments
were performed with the RRM domain and the N-terminal portion of USP10.

(a) G3BP1 is implicated in resveratrol-induced p53 expression. SK-MEL-5 cells expressing
the indicated shRNAs were treated with resveratrol (0–40 µM) for 24 h and then whole cell
lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. Densitometric analysis of relative protein levels
was normalized against β-actin. (b) Resveratrol-induced apoptosis is diminished by
depletion of G3BP1. SK-MEL-5 cells expressing the indicated shRNAs were treated with
resveratrol (0–40 µM) for 48 h and then cellular apoptosis was determined by flow
cytometry. (c) The effect of resveratrol on cell proliferation is diminished by knocking down
G3BP1 expression. SK-MEL-5 cells expressing the indicated shRNAs were treated with
resveratrol (0–40 µM) for 72 h and then formazan production was determined at the
indicated time points by MTS assay. (d) The effect of resveratrol on anchorage-independent
growth is diminished in cells expressing G3BP1 shRNA. SK-MEL-5 cells expressing the
indicated shRNAs were grown in soft agar with resveratrol (0–40 µM) for 7 days and then
the colonies were counted. (e) G3BP1-overexpressing cells are more sensitive to resveratrolinduced apoptosis. HCT116 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs for 48 h and
then treated with resveratrol (0–40 µM) for 72 h. Cellular apoptosis was determined by flow
cytometry. (f) G3BP1-overexpressing cells are more sensitive to resveratrol’s effect on
anchorage-independent cell growth. HCT116 cells transfected with the indicated constructs

analysis of relative protein levels was normalized against β-actin and data are represented as
means ± S.D. from 3 independent experiments (*p < 0.05). (e) G3BP1 negatively regulates
p53 expression in a proteasome-dependent manner. HCT116 cells were transfected with the
indicated constructs for 48 h and then incubated with or without MG132 (10 µM) for an
additional 4 h. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. (f) G3BP1 suppresses
USP10-mediated deubiquitination of p53. H1299 cells were transfected with the indicated

Figure 4. G3BP1 disrupts the interaction of USP10 with p53

(a) G3BP1 (residues 1–139) interacts with USP10 (residues 1–150) in vitro. Three separate
FPLC runs, one run for each protein and the third run with the two proteins combined were
merged into one graph, with the SDS-PAGE results inserted to confirm that the first high
molecular weight peak is a G3BP1/USP10 complex. The results were plotted with dashed
(G3BP1), dotted (USP10), and solid (G3BP1/USP10 complex) lines. G3BP1 eluted from the
gel-filtration column as a monomer (MW 18 kDa) and USP10 (MW ~22 kDa) eluted as a
dimer with an apparent MW of 44 kDa. The elution volumes for gel-filtration standards are
