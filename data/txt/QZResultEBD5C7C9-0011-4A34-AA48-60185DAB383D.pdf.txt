BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most frequent malignant primary bone tumor that occurs mainly in the young,
with an incidence peak observed at age 18 years. Both apomine and lovastatin have antitumor activity in a variety of
cancer cell lines. Apomine, a 1,1-bisphosphonate-ester, increases the rate of degradation of 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, whereas lovastatin
competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity, thereby preventing protein prenylation and cholesterol
synthesis. METHODS: The authors of this report investigated the effect of combined treatment with apomine and
lovastatin in vitro on human and murine osteosarcoma cell lines and in vivo using a murine syngeneic model of osteosarcoma. Apomine and lovastatin synergistically decreased viability and induced apoptosis in both murine and human
osteosarcoma cell lines. RESULTS: Combined apomine and lovastatin strongly decreased HMG-CoA reductase
enzyme levels compared with lovastatin treatment alone. Consequently, the accumulation of unprenylated ras-related
protein 1A induced by lovastatin was enhanced in the presence of apomine. All synergistic effects on cell viability,
apoptosis, and protein prenylation were overcome by the addition of mevalonate or geranylgeraniol, 2 mevalonate
pathway intermediates downstream from the target enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase. This confirmed that the
mechanism of synergy in osteosarcoma cells is through augmented inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Finally,
treatment of POS-1 osteosarcoma-bearing mice with a combination of apomine and lovastatin significantly
reduced tumor progression in these mice compared with single treatments, which had no effect at the doses used.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study revealed that combination therapy with apomine and lovastatin may be a

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone in the young.1 Before 1970, the therapeutic interventions for osteosarcoma were based on aggressive surgery and monochemotherapy, and the prognosis for these
patients was very poor with a 15% overall survival rate. In the late 1970s, Rosen et al introduced the concept of combination therapies involving neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy.2 These novel treatments dramatically
increased the survival rate to up to 70% at 5 years, and a 30% survival rate was reported when pulmonary metastases
were detected at the time of diagnosis. Recently, mifamurtide (liposomal muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine
[L-MTP-PE]) a new therapeutic agent, has been approved in Europe for the treatment of nonmetastatic osteosarcoma
with chemotherapy.3,4 L-MTP-PE is a nonspecific immunomodulator that is a synthetic analog of a component of
bacterial cell walls. However, despite these therapeutic advances, limited improvement in survival has been achieved since
the mid-1980s.
Statins like lovastatin have potent antitumor activity in vitro,5 and some studies in preclinical models have demonstrated that these drugs have antitumor effects in vivo.6,7 Statins are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate-to-cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.
These drugs effectively lower circulating cholesterol levels by decreasing the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol,

predominantly in the liver. In addition, inhibition of
HMG-CoA reductase by statins prevents protein prenylation as a result of inhibiting the synthesis of isoprenoid
lipids downstream in the mevalonate pathway.8 It is
believed that this largely is responsible for the antitumor
effects of these drugs. However, despite their antitumor
activity in preclinical studies, evidence for antitumor
effects in humans has been lacking.9 A likely explanation
for this is that the concentrations needed to exert antitumor effects in vitro may not be achieved in vivo in patients
at the doses used. In a phase 1 study of lovastatin in
patients with cancer, a dose of 1 mg/kg daily used for the
treatment of hypercholesterolaemia resulted in serum
concentrations of 0.15 to 0.3 lM, whereas the maximum
dose of lovastatin that was well tolerated was 25 mg/kg
daily for 7 consecutive days, resulting in a maximum serum concentration of 3.9 lM.10 These concentrations
generally are too low to affect the proliferation and/or survival of the vast majority of tumor cells in vitro.11 Therefore, novel approaches are required to enhance the
antitumor potential of statins, such as combination treatment with other chemotherapeutic drugs.9
Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase by strongly binding to the HMG-CoA binding site of this enzyme, thereby
competitively inhibiting its function.12 This competitive
inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins can induce a
strong (up to 200-fold) increase in HMG-CoA reductase
protein levels within hours, which is the net result of feedback mechanisms activated by the depletion of cellular sterols
and nonsterol mevalonate pathway intermediates that cause
the up-regulation of gene transcription and messenger RNA
translation and the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase degradation.13 Theoretically, this reduces the efficacy of these
drugs to inhibit the synthesis of mevalonate.
Apomine, a 1,1-bisphosphonate-ester, has cholesterol-lowering activity through the inhibition of HMGCoA reductase, similar to statins.14 However, apomine acts
to down-regulate HMG-CoA reductase protein levels by
increasing the proteasomal degradation rate of this
enzyme.15 Although the exact mechanisms for this are
unclear, apomine appears to exert its effects by mimicking
the actions of farnesol,16-18 a metabolite of the mevalonate
pathway intermediate farnesyl pyrophosphate, which plays
a role in feedback regulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity.19 It is interesting to note that apomine exerts antitumor
activity in vitro16,20 and in the 5T2MM mouse myeloma
model21 through mechanisms distinct from the down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase, most likely involving inhibition of the phosphatidylcholine synthesis pathway,18

again mimicking the actions of farnesol.22-24 In a phase 1
study of apomine in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer,
at the initial dose level (125 mg/m2 daily), the plasma
concentration on day 14 of the treatment cycle was
16.4 mg/mL (29.1 mM), and the time to reach it was
3.1  2.3 hours. Its apparent terminal elimination half-life
from 24 to 192 hours was 156.2  42.9 hours. These data
suggested the concordance of apomine concentrations used
in vitro and in vivo and that apomine was well tolerated.20,25
We previously reported that apomine is able to
enhance the antitumor effects of lovastatin on myeloma
cells in vitro by down-regulating HMG-CoA reductase.18
In the current study, we investigated whether apomine
and lovastatin have similar synergistic action in osteosarcoma cells and, importantly, whether this results in a synergistic inhibition of osteosarcoma cell growth in vivo.
Thus, our objective was to evaluate the potential of combination therapy with lovastatin and apomine for the
treatment of osteosarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and Culture Conditions
The rat osteosarcoma OSRGA cell line established from a
radioinduced osteosarcoma26,27 and human MG63 cells
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(LGC Promochem, Molsheim, France) were cultured in
Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Lonza, Brainel’Alleud, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah). Murine osteosarcoma
POS-1 cells were provided by Dr Kamijo.28
Cell Growth and Viability
Cell growth and viability were determined by using a 2,3bis(2 methoxy-4 nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5carboxanilide (XTT) reagent assay kit (Roche Molecular
Biomedicals, Mannheim, Germany). Two thousand cells
per well were plated into 96-well plates and cultured for
72 hours in culture medium in the presence or the absence
of 10 lM apomine (kindly provided by Warner Chilcott
Pharmaceutical, Dublin, Ireland), or 0.5 to 2.0 lM lovastatin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), or a combination of 10 lM
of apomine with 0.5 to 2.0 lM lovastatin. Similar experiments were performed in the presence of 500 lM mevalonate (Sigma), 250 lg/mL phosphatidylcholine (Sigma),
10 lM geranylgeraniol (Sigma), or 50 lM pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-Vad-FMK; Calbiochem, Strasbourg, France).
After the culture period and addition of the XTT reagent,
the absorbance was determined at 490 nm. Cell viability

also was assessed by Trypan blue exclusion; viable and
nonviable cells were manually counted.
Caspase Activity
Twenty thousand cells were treated for 48 hours with apomine (10 lM), or lovastatin (1.0-2.0 lM), or a combination of 10 lM apomine with 0.5-2.0 lM lovastatin.
Caspase-3 activity was assessed in 10 lL of total cell lysate
using the CaspACE Assay System kit (Promega, Madison,
Wis) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
The results were expressed in arbitrary units and were corrected for total protein content using the bicinchoninic
acid test (BCA; Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford,
Ill). Cells that were treated with 100 nM staurosporine for
24 hours were used as a positive control.
Cell Cycle Analysis
Subconfluent cultures of OSRGA, MG63, and POS-1
cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 lM
apomine and/or 1.0 to 2.0 lM lovastatin for 48 hours.
After the treatment period, trypsinized cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.12%
Triton X-100, 0.12 mmol/L ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid, and 100 lg/mL DNase-free RNase A (Sigma).
Then, 50 lg/mL propidium iodide were added, and the
cells were incubated for 20 minutes at 4 C in the dark.
Cell cycle distribution was studied by flow cytometry
(Cytomics FC500; Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France)
based on 2N and 4N DNA content and analyzed by using
DNA Cell Cycle Analysis Software (Phoenix Flow
Systems, San Diego, Calif). G0 cells were identified using
Ki-67 staining (Ki-67-fluorescein isothiocyanate; BD
Pharmingen, Grenoble, France).
Cell Signaling Analysis
Two hundred thousand cells were treated with 10 lM
apomine and/or 1.0 to 2.0 lM lovastatin for 48 hours
and then lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA)
buffer. Twenty micrograms of total cell lysate were subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to
Immobilon-P membranes, which were blotted with antibodies to HMG-CoA reductase (Upstate, Dundee,
United Kingdom), phosphorylated cyclin-dependent
kinase 2 (p-Cdk2) (threonine 160), phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p-Rb) (serine 807/811), phosphorylated cell
division cycle 2 (p-pCdc2) (tyrosine 15), actin (Cell
Signaling Technologies, Boston, Mass), cyclin-dependent

(p21), CDK inhibitor 1 (p27) (BD Biosciences, Le Pont
de Claix, France), phosphorylated cell division cycle 25
homolog A (Cdc25A), unprenylated ras-related protein
1A (Rap1A) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
Calif), or the respective total forms of these proteins. Antibody binding was observed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Roche Molecular Biomedicals).
In Vivo Experiments
Mice (Elevages Janvier, France) were housed under pathogen-free conditions at the Experimental Therapy Unit
(Faculty of Medicine, University of Nantes, Nantes,
France) in accordance with the institutional guidelines of
the French Ethical Committee and under the supervision
of authorized investigators. Four-week-old male C3H/He
mice were anesthetized as described previously before they
were inoculated subcutaneously with a POS-1 cell suspension containing 2  106 cells in the hind footpad.29
Under these conditions, mice develop a primary tumor at
the site of injection in 3 weeks that can be transplanted to
mice of the same strain as a small fragment (2  2  2
mm) in close contact with the tibia. For this purpose, the
periosteum of the diaphysis was opened and resected
along a length of 5 mm, and the underlying bone was kept
intact. The osteosarcoma fragment was placed contiguous
to the exposed bone surface, and the cutaneous and muscular wounds were sutured. Tumors appeared at the graft
site approximately 8 days later, and pulmonary metastases
developed over a 5-week period from the time of grafting.
The tumor volumes (V) were calculated from the measurement of 2 perpendicular dimensions using a caliper
according to the following formula: V ¼ 0.5  LS2,
where L and S represent the largest and smallest perpendicular tumor dimensions, respectively. Four groups of 6
mice were assigned randomly to receive either placebo
(oral administration and intraperitoneal injection of phosphate-buffered saline daily), apomine (oral administration
of 50 mg/kg daily), lovastatin (intraperitoneal injection of
25 mg/kg daily), or a combination of apomine (50 mg/kg
daily) and lovastatin (25 mg/kg daily). For all mice, treatment continued until the animal showed signs of morbidity, including cachexia or respiratory distress, at which
point it was killed by cervical dislocation.
Statistical Analysis
The mean  standard deviation (SD) was calculated for
all conditions, and the results were compared by using the
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Dunn post hoc test.

statin was then assessed at concentrations of the drugs
that, on their own, had little or no effect on viable cell
numbers. In all 3 cell lines, 1 or 2 lM lovastatin did not
affect the number of viable osteosarcoma cells, whereas
10 lM apomine induced approximately 25% inhibition
(P < .001) (Fig. 2A). The combination of both agents exhibited a synergistic effect and induced an approximately 70%
decrease in MG63 and OSRGA viable cell numbers compared with controls (P < .001) (Fig. 2A). This synergistic
effect was even more pronounced for mouse POS-1 cells, for
which the combination of 2 lM lovastatin and 10 lM
apomine induced a decrease in viable cell numbers >90%
(P < .001) (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the synergistic
effect of apomine and lovastatin observed in osteosarcoma
cell lines resulted from the inhibition of cell proliferation
and/or the induction of cell death, the number of viable cells
was scored manually after Trypan blue staining. In MG63
cells, a single treatment with 10 lM apomine or 2 lM
lovastatin resulted in an approximately 35% increase in cell
death, whereas combination treatment induced approximately 70% cell death (P < .001) (Fig. 2B). A similar effect
was observed in POS-1 (P < .01) and OSRGA (P < .05)
osteosarcoma cells.

First, we determined the effect of single treatments with

Combined Treatment With Apomine and
Lovastatin Induces Caspase-Dependent Cell
Death
To characterize the mechanism of cell death induced by
apomine and lovastatin combination treatment, nuclear
morphology and caspase-3 activity were studied in human
MG-63 cells that were treated with these agents for 24 hours
(Fig. 3A,B). The data revealed that the combination of
apomine and lovastatin induced an increase in the number
of cells that displayed nuclear morphology characteristic of
apoptotic cell death, including pyknotic nuclei, nuclear
chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation
(Fig. 3A). Combination treatment also significantly
increased caspase-3 activity compared with single treatments
(Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VadFMK significantly inhibited the decrease in viable cell
numbers induced by the combined treatment, confirming
classic caspase-dependent apoptosis as the predominant
mechanism for human osteosarcoma cell death (Fig. 3C).

inhibition of cell proliferation, flow cytometry of MG63
cells to assess DNA content was performed after 48 hours
of treatment. Although lovastatin did not modulate the
cell cycle in MG63 cells at the concentrations used, 48
hours of apomine treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest in
G0/G1 phase (Fig. 4A). The number of cells in G0/G1
phase strongly increased from 45% to 72% in the presence of 10 lM apomine compared with controls. The
combination of apomine and lovastatin resulted in a similar blockade in G0/G1 phase (Fig. 4A). Staining of cells
for the quiescent (G0) cell marker Ki-67 revealed that apomine, either on its own or in combination with lovastatin,
caused an accumulation of cells in the G0 phase (ie, withdrawn from the cell cycle). Similar data were obtained in
POS-1 and OSRGA cells (data not shown). We used
Western blot analysis to examine which DNA checkpoints in MG63 cells were involved in mediating cell cycle
arrest. The combination of apomine and lovastatin
increased p27 and p21 levels with an associated marked
decrease of Rb phosphorylation, consistent with the
observed blockade of the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase
(Fig. 4B). In addition, combination treatment increased

754

the phosphorylation of cdk2 and cdc25A and reduced the
phosphorylation of cdc2, indicating a switching off of the
G1/S transition (Fig. 4B). These effects on the cell cycle
are consistent with the induction of apoptosis by either
apomine alone or combined treatment with apomine and
lovastatin at the concentrations used (Fig. 4).
Combined Apomine and Lovastatin Treatment
Decreases HMG-CoA Reductase Protein
Levels and Inhibits Protein Prenylation in
Osteosarcoma Cells
To confirm the mechanism of synergy in osteosarcoma
cells, we investigated the effects of single or combined
treatments with apomine and lovastatin on HMG-CoA
reductase protein levels. In the presence of 1 or 2 lM lovastatin, a strong increase in the level of HMG-CoA reductase was observed in all 3 cell lines (Fig. 5), which was the
result of well documented compensatory feedback mechanisms triggered by the decrease in intracellular mevalonate
pathway derivatives.11 However, when the cells were
treated with lovastatin in the presence of 10 lM apomine,
HMG-CoA reductase levels were decreased in MG63 and

33342 staining and (B) caspase-3 activity using a caspase-3 activity assay. The involvement of caspase activity in cell death
induced by combination treatment with apomine and lovastatin was analyzed using the 2,3-bis(2 methoxy-4 nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay in the presence or the absence of 50 lM pan-caspase inhibitor Z-Vad-FMK

OSRGA cells and no longer were detectable in POS-1
cells (Fig. 5). To investigate whether the down-modulation of HMG-CoA reductase levels by apomine alone or
combined with lovastatin altered the process of protein
prenylation, prenylation of the small guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) Rap1A was assessed by Western
blot analysis as an indicator of the protein prenylation status in the cells (Fig. 5). Single treatment with lovastatin
induced a dose-dependent accumulation of the unprenylated form of Rap1A (unRap1A) in all 3 cell lines. This
accumulation of unRap1A was strongly increased in the
presence of 10 lM apomine, although apomine had no

detectable effect on Rap1A prenylation on its own (Fig.
5). These data demonstrated that the combination of apomine and lovastatin synergistically decreases HMG-CoA
reductase protein levels, consequently augmenting the inhibitory effect on the prenylation process.

and apomine on apoptosis, we investigated whether adding back mevalonate or geranylgeraniol (downstream
mevalonate pathway intermediates) could prevent the
induction of apoptosis (Fig. 6). MG63 cells were treated
with a combination of 10 lM apomine and 2 lM lovastatin in the presence or absence of 500 lM mevalonate or
10 lM gerenylgeraniol (GGOH) for 72 hours. Mevalonate and GGOH totally reversed the cell death induced
by the combined treatment with apomine and lovastatin
(Fig. 6A). In line with this finding, mevalonate and, to a
lesser extent, GGOH prevented the induction of caspase3 activity by the combination of apomine and lovastatin
(Fig. 6B). The accumulation of the unprenylated form of
Rap1A induced by the combination of apomine and lova-

756

statin also was abolished by the addition of mevalonate
and was markedly reduced in the presence of GGOH,
whereas mevalonate and GGOH did not affect HMGCoA reductase levels, as expected (Fig. 6C). This confirms
that the prevention of apoptosis by mevalonate and
GGOH is caused by the restoration of protein prenylation
by these mevalonate pathway intermediates acting downstream from HMG-CoA reductase.

mouse osteosarcoma model. In preliminary experiments,
we established the dose-responses of apomine and lovastatin as single treatments in osteosarcoma-bearing C3H/
He mice (data not shown) and determined that 50 mg/kg
apomine and 25 mg/kg lovastatin had no significant effect
on tumor growth on their own, as indicated by the development of tumor volume compared with the placebo
group (Fig. 7A). In contrast, combined treatment with
apomine and lovastatin significantly inhibited tumor development (mean  SD tumor volume, 1205  208
mm3; P < .05) compared with the control (2083  643
mm3), apomine (1948  574 mm3), and lovastatin (1892
 834 mm3) groups (Fig. 7A). This was confirmed further when we analyzed tumor growth between days 9 and
16, when tumor growth was reduced significantly in the
presence of both agents (1000 mm3) compared with either single treatments or with the placebo control (1700
mm3; P < .05) (Fig. 7B), demonstrating that combined
treatment with apomine and lovastatin slowed down tumor progression in osteosarcoma-bearing mice.

presence of HMG-CoA reductase and UnRap1A in MG-63,

10 lM apomine with or without 1 or 2 lM lovastatin for 24

DISCUSSION
Osteosarcoma is a rare malignant bone tumor that affects
mainly young patients. Despite recent improvements in
chemotherapy and surgery, the problem of nonresponse
to chemotherapy remains. This warrants new therapeutic
strategies to improve the overall rate of survival, which has
not changed over the past 25 years. The lack of response

The treatments started 1 day after tumor cell implantation, and tumor volumes were measured every 2 days. (A) The progression of tumor volume is illustrated in individual mice over time.

of patients to chemotherapy and the inefficiency of singledrug therapy to control tumor progression have led to the
development of novel combination therapies. Several
approaches of combination therapy can be envisaged that
target either a single, key lymph node in a signaling pathway by 2 distinct mechanisms, 2 different key lymph
nodes in 1 specific signaling pathway, or 2 key lymph
nodes that control 2 distinct signaling pathways. The
main objective of all such approaches is to increase efficacy
and prevent the emergence of drug resistance.30

The mevalonate pathway plays a key role in the prenylation of small GTPase proteins (including Rap1A,
Ras, and Rho) that are anchored to the cell membrane and
contribute to the organization of the cytoskeleton and
numerous signaling processes that control cell proliferation, migration, and survival.31 The recent work published by Clendening et al clearly demonstrates the key
role of the mevalonate pathway in cell transformation.32
Those authors demonstrated that ectopic overexpression
of HMG-CoA reductase accentuates the growth of

transformed and nontransformed cells and cooperates
with Ras to drive the transformation of primary mouse
embryonic fibroblast cells. Moreover, messenger RNA
levels of HMG-CoA reductase were correlated with a
poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer.33 These
data, combined with the finding that HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, have provided a clear molecular rationale to explore
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin and
apomine) as anticancer agents.
In addition to their cholesterol-lowering activity,
statins have demonstrated complementary antitumor
activities.34,35 For instance, lovastatin synergizes with celecoxib to improve the therapeutic response of patients
with colon cancers35 and bypasses the drug-resistance phenotype of lung cancer cells.36 Lovastatin also modifies
intercellular communications by increasing the expression
of GAP junctions.37,38 A recent retrospective epidemiological study indicated that the administration of statins
in patients who are diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer is associated with improved survival.39 However, in
contrast to these potential anticancer effects, lovastatin
appears to lack efficiency in rodent mammary cancer40;
and, although a low dose of lovastatin seems to be proangiogenic through vascular endothelial growth factor
release, a high dose of lovastatin induces antiangiogenic
effects.41
Although statins can exert anticancer activities, the
potential active transport by membrane protein (adenosine
triphosphate binding cassette) may reduce the drugs’
absorption and disposition and then their activities, leading
to the establishment of drug resistance.42 In this context,
the targeting of HMG-CoA reductase by 2 distinct mechanisms (apomine and lovastatin) may increase efficacy and
decrease the risk of drug resistance in cancer cells. It is well
established that a feedback loop is triggered after the initial
inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by lovastatin, resulting
in an increase in enzyme levels,13 which, in the current
study, was confirmed in osteosarcoma cells. We previously
demonstrated that, in myeloma cells in vitro, combined
treatment with apomine can counteract this compensatory
up-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase and, as a result,
enhances the antitumor efficacy of lovastatin.18 In the current study, we sought to confirm whether a similar synergistic interaction occurs in osteosarcoma cells and whether
this results in enhanced antitumor activity in a syngeneic
murine osteosarcoma model in vivo.
Similar to our previous findings in myeloma cells,18
apomine decreased HMG-CoA reductase levels in osteo-

sarcoma cells without inducing accumulation of the
unprenylated form of the small GTPase Rap1A. Nevertheless, apomine on its own potently decreased viable cell
numbers and induced apoptosis. This confirms the findings from previous studies indicating that apomine exerts
its proapoptotic activity through mechanisms distinct
from the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.16,18 Instead,
apomine most likely induces apoptosis through inhibition
of the phosphatidylcholine synthesis pathway by acting as
a synthetic mimetic of farnesol.16,18
When combining apomine and lovastatin treatment
of osteosarcoma cells, the drug combination resulted in
decreased HMG-CoA reductase protein levels and synergistic increases in the accumulation of unprenylated
Rap1A, indicative of a decrease in HMG-CoA reductasemediated mevalonate synthesis. Furthermore, the synergistic effects on protein prenylation, as well as viability
and apoptosis, all could be prevented by the addition of
either mevalonate or geranylgeraniol (the latter was converted to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, the downstream
isoprenoid lipid used as substrate for the prenylation of
proteins). This confirms that the molecular mechanism of
the synergistic interaction between apomine and lovastatin in osteosarcoma cells is through an enhanced inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.
The synergistic interaction between apomine and lovastatin was confirmed in vivo in a mouse osteosarcoma
model. Combination therapy with apomine and lovastatin resulted in a significant down-regulation of tumor
progression. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence
of a synergistic antitumor activity of these 2 classes of
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in vivo. Now, the efficacy of this approach will need to be confirmed by appropriately controlled clinical trials.
