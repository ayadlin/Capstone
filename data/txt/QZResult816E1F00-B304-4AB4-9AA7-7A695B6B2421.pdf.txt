ABSTRACT
The lack of efficient tumor progression and chemoresistance indicators leads to
high mortality in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. Dysregulated miR-520g
expression is involved in these processes in hepatic and colorectal cancers. In this
study, we found that miR-520g expression gradually increased across normal, benign,
borderline and EOC tissues. High miR-520g expression promoted tumor progression
and chemoresistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, and reduced survival in EOC
patients. miR-520g upregulation increased EOC cell proliferation, induced cell cycle
transition and promoted cell invasion, while miR-520g downregulation inhibited
tumor-related functions. In vivo, overexpression or downregulation of miR-520g
respectively generated larger or smaller subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice.
Death-associated protein kinase 2 (DAPK2) was a direct target of miR-520g. In
116 EOC tissue samples, miR-520g expression was significantly lower following
DAPK2 overexpression. DAPK2 overexpression or miR-520g knockdown reduced
EOC cell proliferation, invasion, wound healing and chemoresistance. This study
suggests that miR-520g contributes to tumor progression and drug resistance by
post-transcriptionally downregulating DAPK2, and that miR-520g may be a valuable
therapeutic target in patients with EOC.

INTRODUCTION

tumor progression and chemoresistance, no reliable
markers exist for prediction of chemoresistance [5].
Several studies reported that aberrant expression
of microRNAs (miRNAs) played a significant role in
chemoresistance and progression of EOC [6–8]. miRNAs
are small non-coding RNAs (20–24 nucleotides) that
exist stably in human serum and mediate biological
processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell
cycle regulation [9, 10]. miRNAs negatively regulate their
targeted genes by specifically binding and degrading the
3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of targeted genes [11].
Therefore, in this study miRNAs were divided into oncomiRNAs and suppressors according to their targeted gene
function in tumors [12].

Most epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients
are diagnosed at advanced stages of disease due to an
absence of early clinical symptoms and early diagnostic
biomarkers, resulting in poor prognosis and short survival
[1]. As a result, EOC is the most lethal gynecologic
cancer worldwide [2]. Cytoreductive or radical surgery
accompanied by platinum-based chemotherapy is usually
recommended for advanced EOC [3]. However, the mean
5-year survival rate is still low at 46%, which is mainly
attributable to chemoresistance and the aggressive nature
of the disease [4]. Despite the availability of studies
describing the molecular mechanisms underlying EOC

MiR-520g is a member of the miR-520 family, which
includes tumor-promoting miRNAs [13]. In progesterone
receptor and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer
patients, high miR-520g levels were negatively correlated
with prognosis [14, 15]. In hepatocellular carcinoma,
miR-520g upregulation promoted tumor cell invasion and
metastasis by reducing SMAD7 expression and inducing
epithelial–mesenchyme transition (EMT) [16]. Further,
miR-520g increased chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) by modulating P21 expression in colorectal cancer
[17].
Death-associated protein kinase 2 (DAPK2) is
a serine/threonine kinase that plays a positive role in
cellular apoptosis and autophagy [18–20]. Targeted gene
prediction showed that miR-520g directly recognized
and bound the DAPK2 3′UTR. However, whether miR520g induces tumor progression and chemoresistance by
directly downreguating DAPK2 in EOC is unclear.
Herein, we demonstrated that miR-520g expression
is significantly increased in EOC and high miR-520g
expression promotes tumor development, increases
chemoresistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and
reduces patient survival. We also demonstrated that
miR-520g directly targets and downregulates DAPK2
by binding the DAPK2 3′UTR. Finally, we showed that
DAPK2 suppression, followed by MAPK and AKT
pathway activation, promotes the biological processes
mediated by miR-520g in EOC.

(p = 0.738), serum CA-125 level (p = 0.852) and histology
type (p = 0.114) (Table 2).
Subsequent Kaplan–Meier analysis with log-rank
test revealed lower overall survival (OS) rates in patients
with miR-520g upregulation as compared to patients
with low tumor miR-520g expression (p = 0.003,
Figure  1B). These results indicate that miR-520g is
a prognostic marker in EOC patients. Furthermore,
miR-520g expression was negatively associated with
OS rates in patients with tumor recurrence (p < 0.001,
Figure  1C) or high serum CA-125  levels (p = 0.004,
Figure  1E). However, no differences were observed
between miR-520g expression and OS rates in patients
without tumor recurrence (p =  0.245, Figure  1D) or
with low serum CA-125 levels (p = 0.174, Figure 1F).
These results suggest that miR-520g predicts survival in
EOC patients with tumor recurrence or high serum CA125 levels. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models showed that high miR-520g expression
was independently associated with EOC progression
(Table 3).

miR-520g promotes proliferation, cell cycle
progression, invasion and chemoresistance in
EOC cells
To investigate the underlying biological functions
of miR-520g in EOC, we evaluated miR-520g expression
in eight EOC cell lines. We selected A2780 and SKOV3
cell lines with low miR-520g expression, and MCAS
and OVK18 cell lines with high miR-520g expression
for further studies (Figure  2A). We developed stable,
high miR-520g-expressing A2780 and SKOV3 cell lines
and knocked down miR-520g expression in MCAS and
OVK18 cells (Figure  2B and 2C). The CCK8 assay
showed that ectopic overexpression or knockdown of
miR-520g significantly increased or inhibited EOC cell
growth in vitro, respectively (p < 0.05 for all, Figure 2D).
Furthermore, in vivo experiments also revealed that
overexpression or downregulation of miR-520g generated
larger or smaller subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice,
respectively, as compared to the control (p < 0.05 for
both, Figure 2E and S1A). Both the in vitro and in vivo
assays demonstrated that miR-520g accelerated EOC cell
proliferation.
Cell cycle analysis was performed using
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We found
that aberrant high miR-520g expression increased the
percentage of S phase cells and decreased that of G0/
G1 phase cells, whereas low miR-520g expression had
the opposite effect (p < 0.05 for all, Figure 2F). These
results were supported by altered cell cycle-related protein
expression. In vitro, ectopic overexpression or knockdown
of miR-520g resulted in increased or decreased
expression of CDK4, CDK6, c-myc, and CyclinD1,
respectively, which are indicators of cell proliferation

RESULTS
miR-520g upregulation promotes tumor
progression and predicts poor survival in EOC
patients
We found that miR-520g expression gradually
increased across 13 normal, 15 benign, 7 borderline
and 116 EOC tissue samples, indicating that miR520g upregulation may mediate the development of
EOC (Figure  1A). Thirty of 110 patients with ovarian
cancer were chemoresistant and 86 were sensitive to
chemotherapy (Table 1). Ninety percent of the patients in
the chemoresistant group, but only 57% of patients in the
chemosensitive group, had high tissue expression of miR520g (Table 1, p < 0.001).
We further analyzed correlations between clinical
features and miR-520g expression in the 116 EOC
patients. We found that 65.5% (76/116) of the patients
showed a high miR-520g expression (Table 2). miR520g upregulation was positively correlated with ascites
(p = 0.017), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), tumor
differentiation (p = 0.002), residual tumor size (p < 0.001),
FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics) stage (p < 0.001), chemotherapy regimen
(p = 0.004) and chemoresistance (p < 0.001), while no
correlations were observed with respect to patient age

expression indicated poorer patient survival with tumor recurrence or high serum CA-125 level.

DAPK2 is a direct target of miR-520g

and transition from G0/G1 to S phase (Figure 2G) [21].
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining also confirmed
that tumor xenografts with miR-520g overexpression or
downregulation showed higher or lower expression of
Ki-67, c-myc, CyclinD1 and PCNA, respectively, than
controls (Figure  2H and S1B). These data suggest that
miR-520g enhanced EOC cell proliferation by inducing
the G0/G1 to S phase transition.
Clinical analysis revealed that miR-520g
expression was positively related to EOC differentiation
and metastasis. Transwell invasion assays showed that
overexpression or knockdown of miR-520g strengthened
or attenuated EOC cell invasion, respectively (p < 0.05
for all, Figure  3A). Wound healing assays showed that
overexpression or knockdown of miR-520g accelerated
or delayed wound healing, respectively (p < 0.05 for all,
Figure 3B). Western blotting demonstrated that levels of
the tumor invasion and metastasis-associated proteins,
MMP2 and MMP7, were increased or decreased in
miR-520g overexpressing or downregulated EOC cells,
respectively (Figure 3C). These results show that miR520g promoted EOC cell invasion in vitro.
To further investigate the role of miR-520g in
chemoresistance, we produced paclitaxel and cisplatin
resistant A2780 cells by treating cultures with gradually
increasing concentrations of the drugs (data not shown).
After overexpressing miR-520g in these cells, we added
paclitaxel (50 μM) and cisplatin (10 μM) for 36 h, then
analyzed cell apoptosis by Annexin V/PI staining and
FACS. miR-520g overexpression reduced apoptosis rates
induced by paclitaxel and cisplatin in both the resistant
and sensitive cells, but apoptosis rates were higher in
sensitive cells (Figure 4A and 4B, *p < 0.05). We found
that miR-520g levels in paclitaxel and cisplatin resistant
cells were significantly higher than in sensitive cells
(Figure  4C, **p <  0.001). These results suggested that
miR-520g promotes chemoresistance to platinum-based
chemotherapy in EOC.

We used a bioinformatics approach involving the
public TargetScan6.2 algorithm to identify the gene targets
of miR-520g. We screened proliferation, cell cycle and
tumor invasion-related targets whose 3′UTRs included the
miR-520g-specific binding site, and identified DAPK2 as a
candidate for further study (Figure 5A). DAPK2 is a tumor
suppressor that promotes apoptosis and tumor cell death
[22]. We compared the protein levels of DAPK2 in miR520g overexpressing or downregulated cell lines using
western blotting, and in tumor xenografts by IHC staining.
We found that miR-520g overexpression or knockdown
induced significant downregulation or upregulation of
DAPK2 protein levels, respectively, in both EOC cell lines
and tumor xenografts (Figure 5B). These results indicated
that miR-520g negatively regulated DAPK2 expression
post-transcriptionally.
To determine whether miR-520g directly
regulated DAPK2 expression via 3′UTR degradation,
we constructed luciferase-dual reporter plasmids with
the 3′UTR of DAPK2 (wild type, WT or mutated, Mut)
and co-transfected cells with miR-520g, anti-miR-520g
or their correspondent negative controls. We found that
miR-520g or anti-miR-520g only decreased or increased
luciferase activity, respectively, when co-transfected
with DAPK2 WT-3′UTR, but not with DAPK2 Mut3′UTR (Figure  5C, **p < 0.001, ***p < 0.0001).
Notably, luciferase activity resulting from miR-520g
overexpression or knockdown was reversed by mutating
the miR-520g-DAPK2 binding sites (Figure 5C). These
results confirmed that DAPK2 is directly regulated by
miR-520g in EOC cells.
We evaluated DAPK2 mRNA levels in 13 normal,
15 benign, 7 borderline and 116 EOC tissue samples, and
found that DAPK2 expression gradually decreased from
the normal to EOC tissue (p < 0.001 for all, Figure 5D).
IHC staining showed DAPK2 in most of the low miR520g-expressing tissues, including normal (Figure 5E1),

as well as the low miR-520g-expressing EOC tissues
(Figure  5E5). By contrast, no DAPK2 staining was
observed in the majority of EOC tissues with high miR520g expression (Figure  5E4). There were 74 cases of
DAPK2  negative staining and 42 of DAPK2 positive
staining among 116 EOC tissues, which was negatively
correlated with miR-520g expression (p < 0.001,

overexpression or knockdown could partially reverse
these effects (Figure 8A and 8B). These results suggest
that miR-520g may activate the MAPK and AKT
pathways and enhance EOC cell chemoresistance and
viability by repressing DAPK2.

DISCUSSION
While tumor progression and chemoresistance
are usually associated with poor prognosis and reduced
survival in EOC patients, the mechanisms underlying these
traits are still not fully determined [26–28]. Mounting
evidence suggests that miRNAs play a significant role
in EOC tumorigenesis and development [6, 29–31].
In the present study, we found that high miR-520g
expression promoted EOC progression, and that miR-520g
upregulation increased chemoresistance to platinum-based
chemotherapy. These findings highlight the important role
of miR-520g in predicting prognosis and chemosensitivity
to platinum-based chemotherapy in EOC patients. Further,
these results indicate that miR-520g may be a therapeutic
target for EOC treatment, and stronger postoperative
chemotherapy regimens are indicated for patients with
high miR-520g expression.
High cell proliferation and invasion rates play
important roles in EOC progression [32,  33]. To
investigate the underlying biological functions of miR520g in EOC, we firstly evaluated the expression of miR520g in 8 EOC cell lines and selected A2780 and SKOV3
cell lines with low miR-520g expression and MCAS and
OVK18 cell lines with high miR-520g expression for
further studies. These different expression levels of miR520g in 8 EOC cell lines might be correlated with the cell
lines different abilities of proliferation rate, invasiveness
and chemoresistance. We demonstrated in vitro and in vivo
that miR-520g regulated the expression of proliferation
and cell cycle-associated proteins and promoted EOC cell
proliferation by inducing the G1 to S phase transition. A
previous study reported that high miR-520g expression
promoted HCC invasion and metastasis by inducing EMT
[16]. In addition, miR-520g also induced endometriosis via
upregulation of MMP2 expression, which is an indicator
of tumor metastasis [34, 35]. Consistent with these reports,
we found that miR-520g upregulation enhanced migration
and invasion in EOC as measured by wound healing and
transwell migration and invasion assays.
Loss or downregulation of tumor suppressors plays
a critical role in tumorigenesis, progression and resistance
to chemotherapy [31, 36]. Further, onco-miRNAs act by
downregulating tumor suppressors [37, 38]. miR-520 h, a
member of the miR-520 family, reportedly downregulates
tumor suppressor DAPK2 expression and contributes to
chemoresistance in breast cancer [39]. miR-520 h directly
inhibited DAPK2 expression, and DAPK2 suppression
was important in miR-520 h-mediated paclitaxel resistance

miR-520g directly suppresses DAPK2 causing
proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance in
EOC cells
In vitro assays showed that DAPK2 inhibited
tumor cell proliferation, wound healing and invasion.
Additionally, miR-520g-promoted cell proliferation,
wound healing and invasion was partially reversed
by DAPK2 overexpression (Figure  6A–6C p < 0.05
for all). These results suggested that miR-520genhanced EOC progression is due, at least in part, to
DAPK2 downregulation.
Subsequently, we explored the role of DAPK2
in miR-520g-mediated cisplatin and paclitaxel chemo­
resistance. We overexpressed or knocked down DAPK2
in the miR-520g-overexpressing or knocked down EOC
cell lines, and treated these cells with PBS, cisplatin
(10 μM) and paclitaxel (50 μM). After 36 h, we detected
apoptotic cells using Annexin V/PI staining and FACS.
We found that chemoresistance cisplatin and paclitaxel
induced by miR-520g was partially eliminated by DAPK2
overexpression (Figure 7A) Similarly, DAPK2 knockdown
partially reversed chemosensitivity induced by miR-520g
downregulation (Figure 7B). These results indicated that
DAPK2 suppression contributes to miR-520g-meditated
resistance to apoptosis and platinum-based chemotherapy
in EOC cells.
In addition, CCK8 assay results showed that miR520g overexpression or knockdown significantly enhanced
or weakened ovarian cancer cell viability, respectively,
compared with controls. DAPK2 overexpression or
knockdown partially abrogated these effects (Figure 7C
and 7D), suggesting that DAPK2 suppression is important
in miR-520g-enhanced EOC cell viability. Levels of
proteins involved in apoptosis, such as caspase3 and
PARP, were measured through western blotting. High
miR-520g expression inhibited caspase3 and PARP
activation, while DAPK2 overexpression partially rescued
activation (Figure 7E and 7F). Because DAPK2 mainly
induces apoptosis through MAPK and AKT signaling
[23–25], we also evaluated the effect of miR-520g
overexpression or knockdown on the activation of these
pathways. We found that miR-520g overexpression or
downregulation could increase or reduce the protein
levels of p-AKT and p-Erk, respectively, while DAPK2

in breast cancer cells. In the same study, restoring
DAPK2 expression abolished miR-520 h-mediated tumor
promotion and drug resistance [39]. DAPK2  mainly
induces apoptosis through the extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1), mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK) and AKT signal pathways [23–25]. In human
obesity, DAPK2 knockdown led to decreased adipocyte
autophagic clearance [41]. In human uterine and ovarian
cancer tissues, DAPK expression was reportedly
downregulated or methylation of the DAPK promoter
was increased [19]. In addition, DAPK downregulation
attenuated irinotecan-induced ovarian follicular apoptosis
[42]. These previous studies suggest that DAPK2 loss or
downregulation may be important in EOC progression and
chemoresistance.
The results of the current study suggested that miR520g downregulates DAPK2 expression by recognizing
and binding to the DAPK2 3′UTR, and degradation of
DAPK2 via targeting by miR-520g was confirmed by
luciferase-dual activity reporter assay in EOC cells. In
addition, DAPK2  was negatively associated with miR520g expression in EOC tissues. Further, miR-520ginduced proliferation, migration and invasion were partially
abrogated by DAPK2 overexpression. As miR-520  h

and miR-520g both are the member of the miR-520 family,
and they can both down regulate DAPK2 expression in
cancer. Whether the effect of miR-520g on DAPK2 is
specific or all the members of miR-520 family have the
same effect of DAPK2 in ovarian cancer is worth to be
further explored.
miR-520g reportedly confers resistance to 5-FU
in colorectal cancer [17]. Here, miR-520g was also
involved in chemoresistance to cisplatin or paclitaxel,
and miR-520g expression levels in the cisplatin or
paclitaxel resistant A2780 cells were significantly
higher than in sensitive A2780 cells. Chemoresistance
associated with miR-520g was antagonized by DAPK2,
which was confirmed by apoptosis and cell viability
assays. We also demonstrated miR-520g could activate
the MAPK and AKT pathways by repressing DAPK2 in
EOC cells.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that miR520g promotes EOC progression and chemoresistance
by negatively regulating DAPK2 expression. Notably,
chemoresistant patients with high miR-520g expression
also showed low DAPK2 expression. miR-520g and
DAPK2 together may be valuable prognostic markers and
could be useful for identifying EOC patients at high risk
for resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy.

were transfected into selected cells using Lipofectamine
2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Invitrogen).

Patients and tissues samples

Western blot analysis and
immunohistochemistry

We obtained 13 normal, 15 benign, 7 borderline
and 116 EOC tissue samples from the Department of
Gynecology and Obstetrics, Shanghai Jiaotong University
Affiliated First Peoples’ Hospital. All patients were
clinically and histopathologically diagnosed between
June 2008 and June 2009. Based on chemosensitivity to
therapy and previous study criteria, we divided the 116
EOC patients into two groups: the chemosensitive group
and the chemoresistant group [43]. The 116 EOC patients’
clinicopathological data are summarized in Table 1. No
cancer patient received neoadjuvant anticancer therapy.
All cancer patients were treated with platinum-based
chemotherapy (TP or PAC) post-surgery (Table S1). We
obtained written and informed consent from all patients.
This study was approved by the Institutional Research
Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University
Affiliated First Peoples’ Hospital.

Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining
were performed to analyze the protein levels of DAPK2
and cell cycle and proliferation-related genes as previously
reported [44]. The percentage of positive cells was scored
as follows: 1) staining area score: 0′, < 10%; 1′, 10–30%;
2′, 31–50%; 3′, > 50%; 2) staining intensity score: 0′, no
staining; 1′, mild staining; 2′, moderate staining; 3′, intense
staining; 3) total staining score based on both staining area
and intensity: 0–2′, negative expression; 3–4′, medium
expression; 5–6′, strong expression. Table S2 describes all
antibodies used in this work.

Cell proliferation and viability assay in vitro
Two thousand EOC cells per well were plated in 96well plates and treated with or without PBS, Cisplatinum
and paclitaxel. After 36 h, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8
Beyotime, Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China) was used to
measure the 490 nm OD values of each well at multiple
time points using a Sunrise Micro plate Reader (Tecan,
Mannedorf, Switzerland).

Cell lines and cultures
The eight human EOC cell lines used in this study
were: A2780, SKOV3, OVA433, ES-2, OV2008, CaOV3, MCAS, and OVK18, and were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection. All cell lines were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO) at 5%
CO2 in a 37°C humidified atmosphere.

Transwell and wound healing assays
In the transwell migration and invasion assay,
1 × 105 cells/100 μL were seeded in the upper chambers
of 24-well plates (Corning, NY, USA) coated with BD
matrigel basement membrane matrix with serum-free
medium. DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS was
added to the lower chamber. After 24 h, cells on the upper
side of the chamber were removed, and cells on the lower
side were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with
crystal violet. The invasive cells were counted under a
microscope.
The wound healing experiment was performed
by plating 1  ×  105 cells per well in 6-well plates, and
scraping a wound when the cells reached the exponential
growth phase. Images were captured at 0, 24, 48 and 72-h
intervals, and wound widths were quantified and compared
to baseline values.

RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cell lines and
paraffinized tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the High Pure FFPE RNA
Micro Kit (Roche, Basle Switzerland) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After synthesizing cDNA,
miR-520g was amplified using real-time PCR, with the
TaqMan Human miRNAs qPCR Quantitation Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) used for quantification
following amplification. The small nuclear RNA U6 was
used as control. The Quantitative SYBR Green PCR
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to quantify
DAPK2  mRNA using GAPDH as the internal control.
The primers used in this study were as reported previously
[16]. All experiments were performed in at least triplicate.

Flow cytometry

Transfection with overexpression vectors,
plasmids and anti-miR

During cell cycle analyses, cells in the logarithmic
growth phase were washed three times with PBS.
Suspended cells at a concentration of 1  ×  106/ml were
fixed with 70% ethanol for 0.5 h. Following propidium
iodide (PI) staining, DNA content was measured using
flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA),

The miR-520g and DAPK2 vectors, including
overexpression vectors, knockdown vectors and the
corresponding negative controls, were constructed as
previously reported [16,  36]. The constructed vectors
