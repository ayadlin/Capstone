Abstract

Author Manuscript

Patients with advanced breast cancer often fail to respond to treatment, creating a need to develop
novel biomarkers and effective therapeutics. Dopamine (DA) is a catecholamine which binds to
five G-protein-coupled receptors. We discovered expression of DA type-1 receptors (D1R) in
breast cancer, thereby identifying these receptors as novel therapeutic targets in this disease.
Strong to moderate immunoreactive D1R expression was found in 30% of 751 primary breast
carcinomas, and was associated with larger tumors, higher tumor grades, node metastasis, and
shorter patient survival. DA and D1R agonists, signaling through the cGMP/protein kinase G
(PKG) pathway, suppressed cell viability, inhibited invasion, and induced apoptosis in multiple
breast cancer cell lines. Fenoldopam, a peripheral D1R agonist which does not penetrate the brain,
dramatically suppressed tumor growth in two mouse models with D1R-expressing xenografts by
increasing both necrosis and apoptosis. D1R-expressing primary tumors and metastases in mice
were detected by fluorescence imaging. In conclusion, D1R overexpression is associated with
advanced breast cancer and poor prognosis. Activation of the D1R/cGMP/PKG pathway induces
apoptosis in vitro and causes tumor shrinkage in vivo. Fenoldopam, which is FDA-approved to
treat renal hypertension, could be repurposed as a novel therapeutic agent for patients with D1Rexpressing tumors.

INTRODUCTION
Dopamine (DA) is a catecholamine that acts as a major neurotransmitter in the brain and as a
circulating hormone in the periphery, where it is produced by sympathetic nerves, adrenal
medulla, and the GI tract.1 DA receptors (DAR) are expressed in peripheral tissues such as
kidney, gut, and coronary arteries,1,2 and their dysregulation is associated with hypertension,
gut motility disorders, and metabolic dysfunctions.2–4 After discovering expression of

functional DAR in human adipocytes and breast adipose tissue,5 we questioned whether
these receptors are also expressed in breast cancer, and if so, what are their functions.
DA binds to five G-protein-coupled membrane receptors, grouped by structure,
pharmacology and function into D1R-like (D1R and D5R) and D2R-like (D2R, D3R and
D4R) receptors. According to the original classification, D1R-like are coupled to Gαs
proteins, activate adenylate cyclase (AC), increase cAMP, and stimulate protein kinase A
(PKA), while D2R-like are coupled to Gαi/o proteins, inhibit AC, suppress cAMP, and
inhibit PKA.6 Such classification is oversimplified, however, as evidence indicates that DAR
can couple to other G-proteins and can activate alternative signaling pathways such as the
guanylate cyclase (GC)/cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway.7,8

Author Manuscript

Several studies reported that activation of D1R-like in striatal neurons,9,10 coronary
arteries,11 and adipocytes,5 increases cGMP, which is generated from GTP by two distinct
guanylate cyclases: particulate (pGC) and soluble (sGC). The pGCs are activated by atrial
natriuretic peptides, while the cytosolic sGCs are the main targets of nitric oxide (NO);12
sGC can be directly stimulated by YC-1 and Riociguat.13 Elevated cAMP or cGMP are
rapidly hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterases (PDEs), a superfamily with 11 members that
differ in substrate specificity and catalytic properties.14 Viagra (Sildenafil), Cialis
(Tadalafil), and Levitra (Vardenafil), used to treat erectile dysfunction, selectively inhibit
PDE5 which hydrolyzes cGMP,15 resulting in sustained cGMP elevation which can lead to
apoptosis.16 Cialis has the longest half-life of the above PDE5 inhibitors.17

Dopaminergic drugs are widely used to treat Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, addiction,
and hyperprolactinemia. Fenoldopam (Fen) is a high affinity (Kd=2.3 nM) peripheral D1R
agonist which does not penetrate the brain. Fen is FDA-approved to treat renal
hypertension,18 while causing only a small drop in blood pressure in normotensive
patients.19 Given its short half-life in the circulation,20 Fen is commonly administered by
infusion.
Our objectives were to: 1) explore D1R expression in breast cancer cell lines and primary
carcinomas, and examine for correlations with tumor attributes and disease outcome; 2)
determine whether D1R activation induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells, and investigate
the mechanism involved; 3) examine if Fen suppresses tumor growth in mouse xenograft
models; and 4) develop an imaging approach for visualizing D1R-expressing tumors and
metastases.

RESULTS

D1R expression in breast carcinomas and cell lines
The DRD1 transcript was cloned from MDA-MB-231 cells and was found to be identical to
the published sequence. Next, breast carcinomas and matched normal breast tissue from the
same individuals were analyzed for DRD1 gene expression by RT-PCR (Figure 1a), and for
D1R proteins by Western blotting (Figure 1b). DRD1 expression was higher in tumors than
in normal breast tissue in 4/7 samples, while tumor D1R proteins were higher in 6/7
samples. Expression of D1R and D2R proteins was compared in eight breast cancer cell

lines (Figure 1c). The D1R proteins were most abundant in the triple-negative MDAMB-231, SUM159, and MDA-MB-468 cells, and were generally lower in the estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive MCF7, T47D, and BT474 cells, except for the ER-positive MDAMB-175 cells. All cell lines also expressed some D2R.
Given reports on lack of specificity of some antibodies against DAR,21,22 we validated the
rabbit anti-D1R monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used in this study. Antibody pre-absorption
with the immunizing peptide abolished the D1R bands in cell lysates by Western blotting
(Figure 1d). DRD1 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1e) and HEK293T cells
(Figure 1f) by shRNA markedly decreased the D1R protein band (Figures 1g and 1h,
respectively). Furthermore, Fen failed to suppress the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells with
downregulated D1R (Figure 1i).

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to visualize D1R in carcinomas and normal breast
tissue. Figure 2a shows a carcinoma with strong D1R staining, which was eliminated by
antibody pre-absorption with immunizing peptide (Figure 2b). A D1R-negative carcinoma
and D1R-negative normal breast tissue are shown in Figures 2c and 2d, respectively.

Author Manuscript

Tissue microarrays were used to score 751 ductal breast carcinomas and 30 normal breast
samples for D1R by IHC. Table 1 provides details of patient demographics and clinical data.
Strong to intermediate D1R staining was seen in 29% of the tumors (Figure 2e), while 56%
of tumors and all normal breast tissue samples were D1R-negative. D1R staining was
significantly associated with pre-menopausal age, ER-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)negative, but Her2-overexpressing tumors (Table 2). A significant association was seen
between D1R-positive tumors and higher tumor stage (Figure 2f), grade (Figure 2g), and
node metastases (Figure 2h). A Kaplan-Meier analysis of 508 tumors revealed that those
with D1R-negative tumors had a median survival of 12 years, as compared to 6 years for
those with D1R-positive tumors (Figure 2i); recurrence-free survival was similarly shortened
(Figure 2j). Supplementary Table 3 shows the statistical analyses.
Suppression of cell viability and induction of apoptosis
DA and three D1R agonists markedly suppressed the viability of MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468 cells, whereas cabergoline, a D2R agonist, had no effect (Figure 3a). DA and Fen
caused a 25–50% suppression of BT-20 and SUM159 cell viability, were less effective in
T47D cells, and were ineffective in MCF7 cells (Figure 3b).

Author Manuscript

Reduced cell viability could be due to decreased cell proliferation and/or increased
apoptosis. Since BrdU incorporation was unaltered by D1R activation (Figure 4d), we
focused on apoptosis. Treatment with DA or with the D1R agonist SKF38393 increased the
percent of apoptotic cells 2-fold, as determined by flow cytometry (Figures 4a and 4b).
Furthermore, Fen increased TUNEL-stained apoptotic cells 4-fold (Figure 4c), and induced
cleavage of caspase 9 (Figure 4e).
Inhibition of cell invasion
We next used Boyden chambers to examine whether D1R activation affects FBS-induced
cell invasion. As demonstrated in Figure 5a, incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells with DA or

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 August 03.

Author Manuscript

Fen inhibited FBS-stimulated cell invasion by 70%, with lower effects seen in BT-20 cells.
Photomicrographs of invaded MDA-MB-231 cells are shown in Figure 5b.
Signaling through the cGMP/PKG pathway
Because D1R agonists are categorized as cAMP/PKA activators, we examined their effects
on cAMP. Unexpectedly, a 60 min incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells with 10 nM DA or Fen
caused 25% and 50% decreases in cAMP accumulation, respectively (Figure 6a). Forskolin,
a direct AC activator, induced a 6-fold increase in cAMP, indicating intact AC/cAMP
machinery. In contrast, DA or Fen increased intracellular cGMP levels 2-fold, while
Forskolin had no effects.

Author Manuscript

We then reasoned that if D1R activation reduces cell viability by increasing cGMP,
bypassing the receptor and directly stimulating cGMP should have the same effect. Indeed,
Figure 6b shows that YC-1, a direct sGC stimulator, reduced cell viability to 5–25% of
controls. In addition, KT5823, a selective PKG inhibitor, prevented Fen-induced apoptosis
(Figure 6c), confirming mediation of apoptosis by PKG. Cialis, which blocks PDE5 and
prolongs cGMP elevation, moderately suppressed cell viability when used alone, but
markedly enhanced Fen-induced apoptosis to 15% of controls (Figure 6d). Other signaling
pathways, e.g., ERK1/2, Akt and CREB, were differentially activated by Fen
(Supplementary Figure S1).
To verify that DA itself inhibits cell viability via D1R, cells were pretreated with the D1R
antagonist SCH39166. Figure 6e confirms that D1R blockade abrogated DA-induced
suppression of cell viability.

Author Manuscript

Our working model is presented in Figure 7. Activation of D1R by agonists such as Fen,
stimulation of sGC by YC-1, and PDE5 blockade by Cialis, all cause augmentation of
cGMP levels, PKG activation and apoptosis. A functional link between D1R and sGC, and
the mechanism by which activated cGMP/PKG leads to apoptosis remain to be determined.
Fenoldopam markedly inhibits growth of xenografts

Author Manuscript

Two mouse xenograft models were used to examine the in vivo effects of Fen on tumor
growth. In one model, mice were inoculated with MDA-MB-231 cells into the inguinal
mammary fat-pad. When tumor volumes reached ~250 mm3, Alzet osmotic mini-pumps
containing vehicle, high-dose or low-dose Fen, were implanted subcutaneously (sc). Within
one week, Fen at high-dose significantly reduced tumor volume (Figure 8a). After 3 weeks,
tumor volumes in mice treated with high- and low-dose Fen were 40% and 60% of controls,
respectively. None of the Fen-treated mice showed adverse physical or behavioral effects.
Tumors exposed to high-dose Fen for three weeks were half the weight of controls (Figure
8d), showed a 4-fold increase in apoptosis (Figure 8e), and a 2-fold increase in necrosis
(Figure 8f).
Another group of mice was inoculated in the flank with SUM159 cells, and high-dose Fen
was delivered by Alzet pumps as above. Compared to the robust growth of control tumors,
Fen treatment caused a dramatic suppression of tumor volumes (Figure 8g), as well as

weights (Figure 8h), to 15% of controls. Remarkably, when pumps were removed after one
week, tumor growth remained suppressed for at least 2 more weeks (Figure 8g).
In vivo imaging of D1R-expressing tumors
We also developed in vivo imaging for detecting D1R-expressing tumors. Mice with MDAMB-231-derived tumors were intravenously injected with rabbit anti-D1R mAb (humanspecific) conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 647 fluorescent dye. Figure 8c shows fluorescence
imaging of two mice 24 hrs after the injection. One mouse shows intense fluorescence at the
primary tumor, while another also has fluorescence in distal metastases, as confirmed
histologically (Figure 8c).

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

This study reports three major findings: 1) substantial expression of D1R in human breast
carcinomas and cell lines, 2) induction of apoptosis by D1R activation via the cGMP/PKG
signaling pathway, and 3) profound suppression of tumor growth by Fen, a peripheral D1R
agonist. Nearly one third of 751 breast carcinomas had strong to moderate D1R staining,
while normal breast tissue samples were D1R-negative. There was a significant correlation
between immunoreactive D1R and advanced disease, i.e. tumors of higher stage, grade, and
lymph node metastases. Notably, positive D1R staining was associated with ER-negative,
PR-negative, but with Her2/neu-overexpressing tumors, indicating that D1R-expressing
tumors do not fit within the ‘triple negative’ category. Most importantly, D1R expression
predicts poor prognosis, as indicated by shorter patient survival.

Author Manuscript

These data suggest that D1R should be considered a novel prognostic biomarker in advanced
breast cancer. D1R expression could be detected in tumor biopsies by IHC, or by a noninvasive imaging such as positron emission tomography (PET), using isotope-labeled D1Rselective ligands.23,24 We foresee that a considerable number of breast cancer patients could
benefit from targeted D1R therapy. FDA-approved drugs such as Fenoldopam, Riociguat, a
sGC activator,25 and Cialis, a PDE5 inhibitor, could be repurposed for treating breast cancer
patients with advanced disease who do not respond to standard hormonal therapy or
chemotherapy.

Expression of DAR in peripheral tissues and in some cancers has been reported,2 but there is
only scant information on their expression in breast cancer. A small study reported binding
of [H3]spiperone, a D2R-like antagonist, in breast tumors,26 and a more recent study
described D3R and D5R expression in breast cancer stem cells.27 However, there are no
previous reports on specific detection of D1R expression in human tumors outside the brain.
Because DRD1 has no introns, our studies carefully verified lack of genomic DNA
contamination and we also rigorously validated the specificity of the anti-D1R antibodies.
DA and three D1R agonists suppressed cell viability, inhibited invasion, and induced
apoptosis in multiple breast cancer cell lines, while a D2R agonist was ineffective. Others
reported that DA or its agonists induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma,28 leukemia,27 ovarian,29
breast,27,30,31 and colon30 cancer cells. However, most studies did not identify which DAR
was expressed in the tumor cells, and often used DA or its agonists at high pharmacological

doses, raising the possibility of non-receptor-mediated toxicity. In contrast, we have
confirmed expression of both D1R gene and protein in breast cancer cell lines and primary
carcinomas, and demonstrated that selective D1R agonists at low nM doses suppress cell
viability and induce apoptosis.
The presence of D1R in breast carcinomas raises several interesting issues: a) the
mechanism responsible for D1R overexpression in tumors vs normal breast tissue, b) the
regulation of D1R expression in malignant cells, c) the minimal level of D1R expression
necessary for responsiveness to a ligand, d) possible ligand-independent actions of D1R as is
the case for Her-2, and e) the roles played by D1R during initiation, progression and/or
metastatic stages of the disease.

Author Manuscript

Another relevant issue is whether circulating DA alters growth of DAR-expressing tumors.
Free DA circulates at very low levels, well below its Kd values. However, in humans, most
DA circulates as DA-sulfate (DA-S), at 10-fold higher basal serum levels than all free
catecholamines combined.32 Sulfo-conjugation of DA, which is carried out in the gut by
SULT1A3, is the major form of peripheral DA inactivation in humans, while
glucuronidation predominates in rodents.33 DA-S does not bind DAR and is biologically
inactive. However, unlike the irreversible inactivation of DA by deamination, O-methylation
or glucuronidation, sulfoconjugation is reversed by arylsulfatase A (ARSA), a releasable
lysosomal enzyme.34

Author Manuscript

Based on our discovery that human adipocytes express ARSA which converts DA-S to
bioactive DA5, we postulate that DAR-expressing breast tumors respond to serum DA-S
only if they have an active ARSA. Moreover, stimulation vs. inhibition of tumor growth by
circulating DA-S/DA depends on a balance of D1R-like and D2R-like expression in each
tumor. Because at low nM level Fen is highly selective for D1R, its ability to suppress D1Rexpressing tumors should not be compromised by the presence of D2R-like. Notably,
rodents do not have a SULT1A3 orthologue,35 and have very low serum free DA levels and
no DA-S. Consequently, mice carrying human cancer xenografts are not good models for
assessing whether serum DA-S/DA affect tumor growth in humans. In addition, a proper
response to agonists requires not only functional D1R, but a coordinated action of all the
components of the cGMP pathway (sGC, cGMP, PDE5, and PKG), which may differ among
cell lines.

Author Manuscript

Our data provide evidence that D1R in breast cancer cells signals via the cGMP/PKG
pathway, as was reported for striatal neurons9,10 and adipocytes.5 Although D1R are
classified by their ability to increase cAMP, we found a decrease, rather than an increase, in
cAMP levels following its activation. This decrease may be secondary to elevated cGMP,
which activates cAMP-hydrolyzing PDEs, underlying a reciprocal relationship between the
two cyclic nucleotides.36
Striatal DA can signal through D1R to increase NO synthesis from L-arginine by activating
neuronal NO synthase.37,38 Elevated NO levels lead to sGC activation, increased cGMP
accumulation and PKG activation, which often result in apoptosis.39 Future studies should

establish the mode of coupling of D1R to sGC, and determine whether NO is an upstream
component of the D1R/sGC/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway in breast cancer.
A combination of apoptosis and necrosis likely underlies the robust in vivo effects of Fen.
The increased necrosis seen in vivo could be due to inhibition of angiogenesis, as DA
reduces tumor angiogenesis in rats40 and mice41 by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth
factor42 and its receptor43 through endothelial DAR.29 The long lasting effects of Fen after
termination of infusion, together with a future development of slow release formulation of
orally-deliverable Fen, bode well for its prospective benefits in the treatment of patients with
D1R-expressing tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-175-VII, BT-20, MCF-7, T47D, BT-474, and
HEK293T were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA);
SUM159 cells were a gift from Dr. S. Wang (University of Cincinnati). All cell lines were
authenticated by the RTSF Genomics Core (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI).
Cells were cultured in DMEM, RPMI, or DMEM/F12 (Corning, Corning, NY) with 10%
FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA) and 50 μg/ml normocin (Invivogen, San
Diego, CA). Medium for SUM159 cells contained 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). T47D cell medium was supplemented with 1 μM insulin (Sigma). Medium for BT-20
and MDA-MB-175-VII cells included 1% ITS+ premix (Corning). For experiments, cells
were plated in growth medium, followed by starvation in treatment medium containing 5%
charcoal-stripped serum (CSS, Atlanta Biologicals) and 1 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma). After
24 hrs, cells were treated as indicated.
DRD1 Cloning from Breast Cancer Cell Lines

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated using RNAspin isolation kit (GE Healthcare). Oligo dT-primed
cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A subset of the
DRD1 transcript sequence, spanning a portion of the 5′ UTR, the entire protein coding
sequence and a portion of the 3′ UTR (nucleotides 434-2316 of GenBank RefSeq
NM_000794; Supplementary Table 1) was PCR amplified, using high fidelity Phusion DNA
polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The amplified DRD1 sequence was
cloned. DRD1 sequences were successfully isolated from MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468,
and MCF-7 cell lines, and sequenced by Genewiz. (South Plainfield, NJ). The MDAMB-231 sequence was confirmed by a complete sequencing of both strands and shared
100% identity with the published sequence.
Conventional RT-PCR and Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR)
cDNA was synthesized from total RNA, using RT2 HT First Strand Kit (Qiagen,
Germantown, Maryland). Because DRD1 does not contain introns, DNase was added during
both RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis, and samples were evaluated for genomic DNA
contamination by omitting reverse transcriptase. PCR amplification was done with primers
for DRD1, or with intron-spanning primers for β2-Microglobulin (β2M) (Supplementary

Table 1). For conventional RT-PCR, products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gel and
photographed. qPCR was done using SYBR Green, and fluorometric products were detected
with a StepOnePlus instrument (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Product purity was
verified using DNA melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR efficiency
was determined by the LinRegPCR program. Fold changes in gene expression were
calculated from cycle threshold and efficiency measurements.
Western Blot Analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells and tissue lysates (40 μg/sample), were separated on 12% SDS gels and transferred to
PDVF membranes. After overnight incubation with primary antibodies (Supplementary
Table 2), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies,
products exposed to SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL) were
photographed. β-actin was loading control. For antibody validation, the rabbit anti-D1R
mAb was incubated for 10 minutes with the immunizing peptide, matching the human D1R
C-terminus sequence (Novus, NBP1-79050PEP, Novus, Littleton, CO), before incubation
with blots.
Knockdown of DRD1 Expression
A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vector, targeted against human DRD1 (MISSION shRNA
SHCLND-NM_000794; TRCN0000011334, Sigma) was used to knockdown DRD1 gene
expression; scrambled vector (Sigma) was negative control. Cells were transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Knockdown was confirmed by qPCR and Western
blotting. For stable transfections, cells were selected using 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Invivogen),
and colonies were picked and expanded.

Tissue Samples

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Matched frozen tissue or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides of breast
carcinomas and normal breast tissues were obtained from the University of Cincinnati
Pathology Department. The institutional review board (IRB) approved the use of deidentified patient samples. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing FFPE samples of breast
carcinomas and normal breast tissues were purchased from Lifespan Biosciences (LSSBRCA121, n=60), Biochain (Z7020005, n=63; Z7020008, n=53), Protein Biotechnologies
(TMA-1007, n=67), NCI Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) (stage II (n=340) or III (n=168)
prognostic TMAs). 751 primary ductal carcinomas and 30 normal breast tissues were
analyzed for D1R expression by IHC. Samples with known outcome (508), were used for
Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall patient survival and recurrence-free survival.

Antigen retrieval was done in boiling sodium citrate buffer for 12 min. Non-specific
antibody binding was blocked, and slides were incubated with anti-D1R mAb (1:500),
followed by anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500). Diaminobenzidine
(DAB) was the chromogen, with hematoxylin counter-staining.

Scoring of IHC

Author Manuscript

IHC staining was scored by two investigators blinded to patient data. The histo-score (Hscore) was calculated as intensity score (0=none, 1=weak, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=strong)
multiplied by percentage of stain-positive tumor cells (≤50=negative, 51–100=weak positive,
101–200=intermediate positive, >200=strong positive).
IHC Statistics

Author Manuscript

H-score results were averaged between data from two observers and duplicate patient
samples. ANOVA was performed for comparing H-score with tumor stage, grade, and node
metastases. P-values <0.05 were considered significant, and those with significance were
adjusted by the Bonferroni method. Data were divided into positive (H-score >50) and
negative (H-score ≤50) staining groups. Pearson’s chi-square analysis was used to test
independence between positive and negative staining groups across different tumor
characteristics. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used for predictors of
mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for association between D1R-positive or D1Rnegative tumors and patient survival and recurrence-free survival. All statistical analyses
were done using JMP version 10 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Cell Viability Assay
Cells were plated at 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates. After starvation, cells were treated
with various doses of the following: DA, YC-1 (Sigma), Fen, SKF 38393, A68930,
cabergoline (all from Tocris), KT5823 (Caymen Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), or Cialis
(Selleckchem, Houston, Texas). After 4 days, cell viability was determined by fluorescence,
using resazurin reduction assay (Sigma).

Author Manuscript

Invasion Assay
Cells were plated at 50,000 cells/well in serum-free medium on top of BioCoat Matrigelcoated inserts with 8 μm pore membranes (BD Biosciences San Jose, CA). The inserts were
suspended over wells containing serum-free medium (Control), or medium with 10% FBS as
a chemoattractant with and without the indicated doses of DA or Fen. After 24 hrs, Matrigel
with non-invading cells was removed, and invading cells were stained with Hoechst
fluorescent dye. Photographs were taken at 10× magnification (Zeiss Axioplan Imaging 2
microscope), and cell number per field was counted in a blinded fashion. Experiments
included 3 inserts per treatment, with 6 random fields photographed per insert.
Flow Cytometry

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated at 200,000 cells/well in 6-well plates, starved, and treated for 48 hr with
drugs. Apoptosis was determined using FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit 1
(556547; BD Pharmingen), and analyzed by flow cytometry using a Cell Lab Quanta SC
Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter). About 10,000 gated events were collected per
treatment. Results were calculated using the Mod-fit program (Verity Software House).

TUNEL Assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides at 10,000 cells/well, starved, incubated with
drugs for 48 hrs, and formalin-fixed. FFPE tumors from mice were sectioned onto slides.
Apoptotic cells were detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method, using TACS TdT In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit:
DAB (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), with hematoxylin counterstain. The number of
TUNEL-positive cells was determined by counting 4 fields/treatment, and apoptosis was
calculated as the number of apoptotic cells/total number of cells × 100.
BrdU Incorporation

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated at 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates, starved, and treated with drugs for 48
hrs. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation was determined by ELISA cell proliferation
kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and absorbance was determined on a KC Junior Plate Reader.
Experiments included 6 replicates per treatment, and were repeated at least twice.
cGMP and cAMP Analyses
Cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well in 24-well plates, starved, and incubated with
treatments for 60 min. Lysates were analyzed for cAMP or cGMP using respective
colorimetric competitive ELISA kits (Cayman Chemical; cAMP: 581001, cGMP: 581021;
Ann Arbor, MI). Limits of detection were 0.3 pmol/ml (cAMP) and 0.23 pmol/ml (cGMP).
Animals

Author Manuscript

Eight-week old female athymic nu/nu mice were obtained from NCI. Mice were housed 4/
cage in sterile cages, kept under light/dark cycles (12 hr:12 hr), and acclimated for 7–10
days before experiments. The animal use protocol (#04-06-29-01) was approved by the
University of Cincinnati Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee.
Mouse Xenograft Models

Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-231 cells (1.5 × 106 cells/60μl) or SUM159 cells (1 × 106cells/60μl) were
suspended 1:1 in PBS/Matrigel and inoculated into the inguinal mammary fatpad or sc in the
flank, respectively. Tumor dimensions were measured twice/week and tumor volume was
calculated as length × width2 × 0.52. Each treatment group contained 6–8 mice. When
tumors were 200–250 mm3 in volume, Alzet osmotic mini-pumps (model 1004, Durect
Corporation, Cupertino, CA) with a 100 μl reservoir, rated for a continuous delivery at 0.11
μl/hr for 4 weeks, were implanted sc in the dorsal neck. The pumps delivered PBS (control),
high Fen (400 ng/kg/min) or low Fen (133 ng/kg/min). After 3 weeks, animals were
sacrificed and tumors were weighed. Tumors were FFPE for TUNEL assay or
histopathology. One group with SUM159-derived tumors had the pumps removed after one
week and tumor monitoring continued for another two weeks.
In vivo Fluorescence Imaging
The rabbit anti-D1R mAb were fluorescently labeled using a SAIVI Alexa Fluor 647
Antibody Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes by Life Technologies). The labeled antibodies
(100 μg proteins) were injected by tail vein into mice with MDA-MB-231-derived inguinal

tumors of moderate size. Mice were imaged 24 hrs after injection using Kodak In Vivo
Multispectral Imaging FX (Carestream Molecular Imaging). Rabbit IgGs were also labeled
with Alexa Fluor 647 and injected into mice as a negative control; there was no specific
fluorescence in the tumors.
Statistics
Student’s t-test or ANOVA were used where appropriate. P-values ≤0.05 were considered
significant. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times, unless otherwise noted.

Proposed model of D1R signaling via the cGMP/PKG pathway in breast cancer cells. Fen
binds to D1R, activates sGC, increases cGMP levels, and activates PKG, leading to
apoptosis. This pathway can also be activated by YC-1 or Riociguat through sGC, and by
Cialis, Viagra or Levitra through PDE5 blockade; KT selectively inhibits PKG. Underlined
compounds are all FDA-approved for various diseases.
