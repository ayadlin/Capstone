ABSTRACT
Patient derived xenografts (PDXs) have become a vital, frequently used,
component of anti-cancer drug development. PDXs can be serially passaged in
vivo for years, and shared across laboratories. As a consequence, the potential for
mis-identification and cross-contamination is possible, yet authentication of PDXs
appears limited. We present a PDX Authentication System (PAS), by combining a
commercially available OpenArray assay of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
with in-house R studio programs, to validate PDXs established in individual mice
from acute lymphoblastic leukemia biopsies. The PAS is sufficiently robust to identify
contamination at levels as low as 3%, similar to the gold standard of short tandem
repeat (STR) profiling. We have surveyed a panel of PDXs established from 73
individual leukemia patients, and found that the PAS provided sufficient discriminatory
power to identify each xenograft. The identified SNP-discrepant PDXs demonstrated
distinct gene expression profiles, indicating a risk of contamination for PDXs at high
passage number. The PAS also allows for the authentication of tumor cells with
complex karyotypes from solid tumors including prostate cancer and Ewing’s sarcoma.
This study highlights the demands of authenticating PDXs for cancer research, and
evaluates a reliable authentication platform that utilizes a commercially available
and cost-effective system.

management of patient samples. With the increasing
use of PDXs in cancer research, implementation of a
rapid, accurate and cost-effective genotyping system for
PDX authentication would improve the integrity of data
produced from PDXs.
Short tandem repeats (STRs) are repetitive
sequences of DNA that are distributed throughout the
human genome [14–16]. STRs have a high mutation
rate that results in a large diversity of repetitive
sequences across the human population. The ability
to quantify repetitive elements and their diversity in
the population has resulted in the implementation of
STRs for the purpose of human identification across

INTRODUCTION
Patient derived xenografts (PDXs) are a vital tool
for the pre-clinical evaluation of new drugs [1–6]. PDXs
are established from patient biopsies by engraftment into
immunodeficient mice, thereby allowing for pre-clinical
animal testing [7–12]. The validation of PDX models has
been the focus of extensive research, primarily to confirm
that they faithfully reproduce the primary disease state
[13]. In contrast, the need to authenticate PDXs (whereby
PDXs are confirmed to be pure and derived from the
original patient biopsy) has been largely overlooked,
resulting in potentially misleading reports and miswww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

forensic science, cell line authentication, and in limited
instances authentication of PDXs [17]. The high
demand for this technology and its widespread use has
resulted in commercially available kits for profiling and
authentication, and is now a requirement for publication
of cell lines in many journals.
The analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) within cell populations has become increasingly
attractive as a method for cell line authentication [18–
21]. SNPs offer a similar level of accuracy to STRs for
correctly identifying cell lines. Their much lower mutation
rate and higher throughput with automated analysis led
to proposals to use SNPs for the authentication of cell
lines [22–24]. Even though cell lines are often profiled
by STR, PDXs generally have not been routinely profiled
to date, which provides an opportunity for SNP-based
authentication. PDXs are often the final step prior to
clinical evaluation of a novel drug, so it is important to
authenticate these samples in a rapid, accurate and costeffective manner.
Herein we describe the implementation of a SNPbased PDX-Authentication-System (PAS), that utilizes
a commercially available, high-throughput, and costeffective SNP genotyping platform and in-house R studio
programs, to test a large panel of PDXs derived from
pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and solid
tumor (e.g. prostate cancer and Ewing’s sarcoma) patient
samples. The detection threshold for this method was
found to be comparable with STR profiling. In particular,
we found that patient-derived samples exhibiting
complex karyotypes (commonly found in cancer cells
[25–27]) or even chimerism, could be identified using
this technology.

To develop a panel of reference barcodes for each
patient/PDX, genomic DNA was harvested from patient
samples used for the establishment of the PDX, or if
unavailable, a sample from the earliest available PDX
passage. Samples were genotyped at the 32 SNPs of
interest, and a barcode was generated for each sample
(Figure 2). Hierarchical clustering confirmed that no two
PDXs shared the same profile. Two pairs of these PDXs
(as labeled with *) were derived from paired samples
of the same patient (i.e. diagnosis and relapse sample),
and each pair showed an identical match. Three SNPs
locating at the Y chromosome, i.e. C___1027548_10,
C___8938211_10 and C___1083232_10, were absent
in all female samples (Figure 2). All cells harvested
from subsequently xenografted mice were validated to
ensure they matched the expected SNP reference profile.
The detailed SNP profile for all PDXs is available in
Supplemental Table S1.

SNP genotyping in contamination identification
The allelic discrimination plots of individual SNPs
allows for the identification of samples that are a mixture
of two or more PDXs. The evaluation of mixed samples
was performed by mixing DNA of two PDXs at fixed
ratios. PDXs ALL-10 and ALL-19 (Figure 3A and 3B) or
ALL-46 and ALL-35 (Figure 3C and 3D) were serially
mixed in ratios of 1:1, 1:3, 1:7, 1:15 and 1:31.
In cases where the two pure samples are
homozygous for the opposite allele (Figure 3A and 3C),
the 1:1 mix appears as a heterozygous SNP. Detection
of a sample contaminated at 1:31 can be identified as
the multicomponent curve shifts away from the pure
homozygous sample, suggesting the late amplification of
the opposite allele. Yet, at SNP loci with a heterozygote
allele in one sample (Figure 3B and 3D) the identification
of a mixture is more challenging, and the detection of
contamination is limited in highly diluted mixtures. When
identifying a mixture in a sample, it is the integrated
analysis of the allelic discrimination plots for all 32 SNPs
that is revealing, and in both cases illustrated, the mixture
could be easily identified at a ratio of 1:31.
Contamination of a sample can lead to competition
between two PDXs, and the potential disappearance of
the original PDX. A contaminated PDX ETP-4 at Passage
2 (ETP-4 P2) was expanded into Passage 3 (ETP-4 P3)
and the shift is visible in the allelic discrimination plot
between the two passages (Figure 3E and 3F). Further
SNP and STR analysis (data not shown) confirmed that
the contaminant was PDX ETP-5. In this example, it is
clear that ETP-4 P3 has shifted towards ETP-5, and that
the contaminant is out-competing the original PDX.
Identification of contaminants allows for problematic
samples and data to be discarded appropriately.

RESULTS
Potential causes of PDX mis-identification
Although there are a number of scenarios that
could potentially lead to PDX mis-identification, two
common errors are illustrated in Figure 1. These include
the mis-identification of a sample (due to labeling or
communication errors), or the cross-contamination of
two or more PDXs (possibly due to carry over of samples
during harvest). Both examples are illustrated at Passage
3. If a sample derived from Patient B is mis-identified
as belonging to Patient A, this can be carried over in
subsequent expansions and experiments (Passage 4).
Alternatively, if a sample is contaminated with two PDXs
(for example an equal mix of Patient A and Patient B
at Passage 3), both samples will compete in the mouse
and one sample may eventually dominate the other
(for example Patient B dominated Patient A in Passage
4). In contrast, a pure and matched PDX sample is also
illustrated at Passage 3, which maintains characteristics of
leukemia cells from Patient B.

maintained separation from the validated group and
were significantly enriched with undetermined genotypes
(white squares; Figure 4B).
Within PAS, we proposed to further verify the
undetermined genotypes in the potentially contaminated
groups with integrated analyses of allelic discrimination
plots for all 32 SNPs. Plots of three representative SNP
probes in PDXs from Group 2 and 3 are demonstrated
in Figure 4C. Amplification curves from the 8 PDXs in
Group 2 shift away from the pure homozygous allele
amplifications (Allele 2 for C___1007630_10 and
C__31386842_10; Allele 1 for C___8850710_10),
indicating contamination in these samples. In addition, all
the 8 PDXs were recorded to be generated from the same
experiment. However, the amplification curves from the 3
PDXs in Group 3 still match with the pure homozygous
allele amplification, even though amplification of some
samples (all 3 samples with C___1007630_10 and P5-39
with C___8850710_10) are not as robust as that of other
PDXs. This indicates that the undetermined genotypes
of the Group 3 PDXs are likely due to inefficient
amplification rather than contamination. For a similar
reason, the Group 1 PDXs reveal no contamination either
(data not shown). Overall, 8 passage-5 ALL-19 PDXs

We have established a platform, i.e. PDXAuthentication-System (PAS), by combining a
commercially available TaqMan 32A OpenArray platform
with our in-house R studio programs, to validate PDXs
derived from every individual mouse used in our group.
In this study, we performed a representative analysis on a
panel of 1 patient sample and 74 PDXs derived from the
same patient ALL-19, including: 6 xenografts of passage
3, 6 xenografts of passage 4, and 62 xenografts of passage
5, as described in Table 1 and Supplemental Table S2.
Barcoding these samples with the 32 SNP probes
generated SNP profiles of ALL-19 PDX engrafted in 74
NOD/SCID mice and one patient sample (Supplemental
Table S2). These were clustered with the reference
SNP profiles from Figure 2. Sixty xenografts, including
all xenografts from low passages (i.e. P1, P3 and P4),
are clustered together and match with the reference
ALL-19 profile - these are considered to be validated
(Figure 4A). However, 3 groups from passage 5 reveal
discrepant profiles and locate away from the validated
ALL-19 group in Hierarchical Clustering. Focusing
on the ALL-19 PDXs, we found that the 3 groups

Figure 1: Examples of PDX mis-identification. PDXs established from either patient A or B are inoculated into a suitable number of

mice (four mice in this example at Passage 1). Once the mice reach a defined endpoint, each mouse contributes a large number of samples
to expand the biobank (each mouse contributes three samples in this example). Each sample can be serially expanded, as shown in Passage
2. Potential common mistakes involve either mis-labeling (or mismatch) of samples or contamination of one sample with another sample
(shown at Passage 3). If mis-identification or contamination is not corrected early, samples can be serially expanded (Passage 4). In the
case of contamination if this is not identified early on in the process, a mix of equal parts can lead to competition and a dominant sample
can take over (Passage 4).

decade of routine lab work.

This highlights the importance of validating PDX samples
prior to any other studies, as mixed samples are not
obvious in many assays.

Characterizing SNP-discrepant PDXs

Chimeric profiles in samples from patients posttransplant

Performing gene-expression microarray studies
on the SNP-discrepant PDXs further confirmed
the contamination identified by the PAS. The gene
expression profiles (GEPs) of two validated ALL-19
PDXs, P5-17 and P5-35, are highly correlated with
each other, showing high correlation coefficient R
values (red; Figure 5A). The GEP is maintained almost
unchanged after 24 h culture in vitro. However, the
SNP-discrepant ALL-19 PDX, P5-18, shows a very
distinct GEP compared to the two validated PDXs (low
R value, green). Furthermore, P5-17 and P5-35 are
closely clustered together (Figure 5A) and show similar
gene expression in the heatmap (Figure 5B), but are
mismatched with P5-18.
However, the low level of contamination may be
overlooked in studies such as cytotoxicity assays. There
was no significant difference between the validated
PDXs and the contaminated PDX in their responses to
cisplatin and dexamethasone in vitro (Figure 5C and 5D).

Bone marrow or cord-blood transplantation is a
common treatment option for high-risk leukemia patients,
and results in patients with chimeric genotypes in their
hematopoietic compartment (patient and donor). Allelic
discrimination plots were examined at 4 SNPs for a
patient sample before (PRE) and after (POST) a doublecord blood transplant (Figure 6), in which cord blood from
two donors was used for transplant. For all SNPs, the pretransplant sample (PRE) clusters with the other samples
on the chip without any signs of imbalance suggesting a
pure and single-origin sample. The post-transplant sample
(POST) is an outlier, and is shifted away from the PRE
sample and all other samples on the chip, suggesting a
mixture of DNA in the sample. Thus, as a result of the
double-cord transplant, the POST sample for this patient
has a chimeric profile that is easily detectable with the
PAS platform.

Figure 2: Heatmap of the SNP profile of 75 established PDXs. DNA was extracted from the earliest available sample from 73

patients (typically the patient sample), and SNP genotyped on the Taqman OpenArray 32A Barcode. This provides the reference profile for
all the PDXs. All 32 SNPs are bi-allelic resulting in a Homozygous Allele 1 (red), Homozygous Allele 2 (blue), Heterozygous (green), or no
amplification (white) reading. Samples are clustered according to the SNP TaqMan assay (Y-axis) to identify any matches. The 24 female
samples are labeled with a black line. 2 pairs of PDXs (labeled with *, ALL-80/-81 and ALL-82/-83) match as expected because they are
derived from the same patient. Any PDX can be cross-referenced to this table to identify a mismatch. The details of the SNP genotype for
all PDXs are provided in Supplementary Table S1.

probes (4 white squares per PDX on average in Figure 8),
and discrepancies in SNP profiles between pre-PDX and
matching PDX samples (6 SNPs for X167R and 5 SNPs
for X224R). Despite several discrepant SNPs, the SNP
profiles were highly consistent in PDX samples derived
from the same patient.
Finally, to assess the reproducibility of the PDX and
PAS systems we analyzed 4 pairs of ALL PDXs (ALL-80/81, ALL-82/-83, ALL-32/-90, ALL-65/-220), each pair
being derived from the same patient sample. In each case
the PDX SNP analysis was identical (Figure 8).

Cancer cells can have complex karyotypes due to
chromosomal duplications, deletions and translocations,
all of which can impact SNP genotyping. We previously
identified a heterozygous deletion of the long arm of
chromosome 9 (chr9: 37,380,672 - 113,090,178) and
multiple amplifications (copy number = 3) of chromosome
6 (chr6: 30,466,936 - 170,792,391) in the ALL-17
genome (Table 2) [28]. The 32A OpenArray Genotyping
chip contains 1 SNP (C___1801627_10) located at
the deletion region on the chromosome 9, and 2 SNPs
(C___7421900_10 and C__27402849_10) located at the
amplification region on chromosome 6 (Table 3). The
heterozygous deletion on chromosome 9 in ALL-17 results
in abnormal amplification curves of C___1801627_10
located between the pure homozygous allele2
amplifications (blue curves) and the equal amplification
of two heterozygous alleles (green curves; Figure 7A).
Next, the heterozygous amplification on chromosome 6
results in a shift in amplification of 2 SNPs away from
the heterozygous alleles towards allele 2 (Figure 7B and
7C). This indicates that the two SNPs are heterozygous in
ALL-17 and there are more copies of allele 2 than allele
1. Moreover, despite shifting away from all other samples
on the chip, the amplification curves of these SNPs are
consistent across all ALL-17 samples. In contrast, two
SNPs located at normal genomic regions on chromosome
6 and 12 serve as controls, showing pure homozygous
allele 1 amplification (red curves) and equal amplification
of two heterozygous alleles (green curves; Figure 7D and
7E, respectively). Therefore, changes in SNP genotyping
profiles due to complex karyotypes should be taken into
account during the authentication process.
Furthermore, we examined the utility of the PAS to
authenticate solid tumor PDX models, such as prostate
cancer and pediatric Ewing’s sarcoma. Prostate cancer
PDXs from three patients and Ewing’s sarcoma PDXs
from two patients were SNP barcoded and clustered
with our reference table (Table 4; Figure 8). In all cases
the pre-PDX (including blood and/or original tissues)
and matching PDX samples clustered together, which
warrants using PAS for authentication of these PDXs.
However, for two of the prostate cancer lines (X167R
and X224R), there were undetermined SNPs for several

DISCUSSION
We have developed a SNP-based PDX authentication
system, PAS, that has potential application for the
authentication of PDXs. Thirty two SNPs were genotyped
using PAS, which generated a patient specific profile that
can be used to track patient tissue and identify mixed
samples at dilutions as low as 1 in 32. Our observation that
SNP profiles were conserved in PDXs established from
the same patient in independent experiments (Figure 8)
supports the use of SNP analysis for PDX authentication.
We successfully identified contaminated PDXs from a
panel of ALL-19 samples from various passages engrafted
in 74 individual mice. We also identified a patient sample
post-transplant with clear evidence of somatic mosaicism
due to donor and recipient cells. Furthermore, despite the
genomic instability of cancer cells that can cause changes
in the SNP genotyping profile, a patient’s karyotype can
be used to control for these changes. We have generated
full genotypes of all commonly used PDXs in our group,
and used PAS to validate every PDX sample prior to any
other studies.
SNP genotyping for the purpose of human
identification is an increasingly accepted technology that
offers several advantages over traditional STR profiling.
SNPs have a lower mutational rate than STRs, offer higher
throughput with rapid automated analysis, are more costeffective, and offer equivalent discriminatory power [23,
24, 29–31]. The challenge for the implementation of SNP
genotyping is the establishment of a standard panel of
SNPs that can be used for identification purposes, and
that can be readily shared across laboratories. To this end,
we chose a commercially available pre-designed panel

that can be readily purchased for low or high-throughput
applications for the purpose of human identification.
The discriminatory power of this panel is such that in a
biobank of 10,000 samples, the probability of a random
match is less than 0.0005%. As expected, in our biobank
of PDXs from 73 patients, all our patient samples were
confirmed to be different from each other, and the closest

two samples (etp6 and all45) were different in 12 SNPs.
Furthermore, the PAS is sufficiently robust to identify
mixtures down to 1 in 32, which is similar to the expected
ratios of STR profiling [17, 22]. These data demonstrate
that the detection of contaminated PDXs by PAS is
possible, however, compared to STR, the identification of
the contaminating PDX by PAS is challenging.

SNP genotyping allows for more extensive
validation of a biobank compared to STR profiling. Based
on cost estimates and time commitment, our PAS system
costs approximately US$7.20 per sample, while STR
usually costs around US$20–30 per sample. In addition,
sample handling for 96-samples is 50 min for PAS and
3 h for STR, and machine run times for 96-samples are
3.5 h for PAS versus 18 h for STR [17, 32]. In practice,
this means that SNP validation is sufficiently cost effective
to validate every sample in an experiment, rather than
using STR validation of one representative sample per
experiment. While the cause of a mis-identified sample
is often difficult to determine, our experience with SNP
validation has shown that it is important to validate all the
samples from an experiment to prevent one mis-identified
sample from contaminating the entire PDX line.
SNP genotyping offers authentication in cancerderived xenografts that have high genomic instability.
Genetic drift is commonly reported in cell lines that have
been extensively cultured or that exhibit deficiencies in
mismatch repair, resulting in changes in the karyotype
or the gene loci that can affect the STR profile [17, 22].
Similarly, cancer cells can have complex karyotypes
that can confound the results of STR analysis. While
SNP genotyping is not immune from such changes in
the genetic profile, SNPs have a much lower overall
mutational rate than STRs (2.5 x 10-8 vs 10-3 to 104
), reducing the chances of spontaneous change [33].
Furthermore, changes in a SNP profile are more likely
to be the result of whole or partial chromosome changes
that can be detected in a patient’s karyotype. One
example is using PAS to authenticate PDXs with complex
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

karyotypes, such as ALL-17 and several solid tumors.
Several undetermined SNPs (shown as white squares) and
discrepancies between pre-PDX and PDX samples were
identified, which could be due to 1) complex karyotypes
of these PDXs as discussed in Figure 7, or 2) genomic
differences between the normal and cancer cells and the
infiltration with normal tissues in solid tumor samples.
Nevertheless, SNP profiles across passages of PDXs
were consistent, suggesting that white squares in PDXs
can be interpreted as correct barcodes, as long as they
are consistent from primary xenografts to high passage
xenografts.
Cell line authentication has become a routine
procedure in most laboratories to track mis-identified
cell lines, and is a requirement for publication in many
journals [17]. However, journals currently do not enforce a
similar standard on PDXs, which can have the same issues
of mis-identification and contamination as cell lines. PDXs
are frequently used in animal experiments that are more
resource intensive compared to experiments involving
cell lines, and the data generated following animal
xenografting experiments are increasingly being linked to
patient clinical outcome [1, 8] and can be used to direct
treatment [34]. In our study, although the majority of
SNPs were consistent, 10% were identified as discrepant
in ALL-19 PDXs (8 passage-5 of 74 PDXs) using the
PAS platform, indicating the need to monitor this at high
numbers of passage. These contaminated PDXs showed
similar responses to validated PDXs in cytotoxicity
assays. While this type of contamination may be rare
with solid tumor PDXs since they are often propagated as
tumor pieces, the PAS may still be helpful for eliminating

Figure 8: Authentication of solid tumor PDXs using PAS. Prostate cancer PDXs from three patients (X167, X224 and X305;

groups 1, 2, and 5 with red frames), and Ewing’s sarcoma PDXs from two patients (RA001 and RA019; groups 3 and 4 with green
frames), were SNP barcoded and clustered with the Reference SNP profiles. See Table 4 for details of the PDXs. In the heatmap, red
refers to Homozygous Allele 1, blue refers to Homozygous Allele 2, green refers to Heterozygous, and white refers to no amplification or
undetermined PCR. Four pairs of ALL PDXs (labeled with *, ALL-80/-81, ALL-82/-83, ALL-32/-90, ALL-65/-220) match as expected
because they were derived from the same patients in independent experiments.

human error during labeling and archiving. Therefore, the
authentication of PDXs is a particularly important quality
control process. The advent of PAS has made this process
highly cost-effective and rapid, enabling more routine
screening of PDXs.

Genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets of
approximately 5 million cells using the PureLink Pro
96 Genomic DNA Kit (K1821-04A, Life Technologies,
USA), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was
quantified with the QuantiFluor dsDNA dye (E2670,
Promega, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical statement and ALL patient tissue

SNP genotyping

ALL specimens were obtained for xenografting
with informed, written consent approved by the Human
Research Ethics Committees of the South Eastern Sydney
Illawarra Area Health Service (HREC10114) and the
University of New South Wales (HREC10442), and the
Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of
New South Wales (15/105B). The release of both primary
ALL cells for xenografting and primary patient DNA
samples for this study was approved by the Children’s
Cancer Institute Australia Tumor Bank Management
Committee.

Purified genomic DNA (150 ng) was amplified using
the TaqMan 32A OpenArray Genotyping Barcode Panel
(4475386, Life Technologies, USA). Samples were loaded
using the AccuFill system, and amplification performed on
the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time qPCR instrument.
The QuantStudio 12K Flex software was used to manually
determine genotype profiles for 32 chosen SNPs, and the
data exported for further analysis. The QuantStudio 12K
Flex performs a multicomponent analysis based on the
qPCR curves for each bi-allelic assay, and generates a
real-time allelic discrimination plot. Homozygous alleles
amplify on the x or y axis, with heterozygous alleles
amplifying along the x = y slope.

Preparation of patient ALL samples and
isolation of DNA

Data analysis using in-house R studio programs

Bone marrow aspirates (2-4 mL) were collected
in Acid Citrate Dextrose tubes (Becton Dickinson,
USA) from anaesthetized pediatric patients for the
primary purpose of leukemia diagnosis and minimal
residual disease (MRD) diagnostics. Immediately after
collection in local hospitals, the bone marrow aspirates
were transported at room temperature to the laboratory
and mononuclear cells purified by density gradient
centrifugation. The surplus mononuclear cells were
aliquoted and cryopreserved in fetal calf serum with 10%
DMSO in liquid nitrogen.

SNP genotype profiles of the PDX samples were
exported into an Excel file and analyzed using in-house
R scripts written with R Studio. Briefly, a reference
table of patient or the earliest available PDX passage
genotype profiles was generated using a script “Assign
References.r”. Any new reference profile could be added
to the existing reference table by a script “AddCalls.r”.
Matching the PDXs to their reference SNP genotype
profile was done using a script “Validation function.r”.
This would generate 3 text files, including a summary
of genotyping results, a list of contaminated samples,
and a list of validated samples. Next, a heatmap could be
generated using a script “OneFunction heatmap.r”. All R
scripts are provided in the Supplementary Materials.

Establishment of ALL PDXs
PDXs were established based on a previously
published protocol [2, 7, 8]. Briefly, patient mononuclear
cells purified as described above were inoculated into
nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient
NOD/SCID or NOD/SCID/IL-2 receptor gamma
negative (NSG) mice by tail vein injection. Engraftment
was monitored weekly by flow cytometry analysis of
human CD45 cells in the peripheral blood. Mice were
euthanized if they showed overt signs of leukemia.
Mononuclear cells were harvested from the spleen as
described above.

Microarray analysis
For gene expression and microarray studies, RNA
was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA).
The microarray analysis of gene expression was performed
using Illumina HumanHT-12 chips and analyzed using
GenePattern as previously described [36–41]. The data
were deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus [42]
(GSE74299).

Establishment of PDXs from solid tumors

Assessment of chemodrug sensitivity

Full details of ethical statements and methods of
establishing PDXs from prostate cancer [35] and Ewing’s
sarcoma patient samples are provided in the Supplemental
Methods.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PDXs were cultured in QBSF 60 medium (Quality
Biological, USA) supplemented with Flt-3 ligand (20 ng/
mL, ProSpec, USA), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin

(100 μg/mL) and L-glutamine (2 mM) (QBSF 60/F).
Cisplatin and dexamethasone sensitivities were assessed by
measuring mitochondrial activity via the Alamar Blue assay
or cell viability by 7-AAD exclusion using flow cytometry
as previously described [10, 12, 40, 41]. Cell viability was
expressed as a percentage of vehicle treated controls.
