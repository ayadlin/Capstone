ABSTRACT:
Most normal cells have two centrosomes that form bipolar spindles during mitosis,
while cancer cells often contain more than two, or “supernumerary” centrosomes.
Such cancer cells achieve bipolar division by clustering their centrosomes into two
functional poles, and inhibiting this process then leads to cancer-specific cell death.
A major problem with clinically used anti-mitotic drugs, such as paclitaxel, is their
toxicity in normal cells. To discover new compounds with greater specificity for cancer
cells, we established a high-content screen for agents that block centrosome clustering
in BT-549 cells, a breast cancer cell line that harbors supernumerary centrosomes.
Using this screen, we identified 14 compounds that inhibit centrosome clustering and
induce mitotic arrest. Some of these compounds were structurally similar, suggesting
a common structural motif important for preventing centrosome clustering. We next
compared the effects of these compounds on the growth of several breast and other
cancer cell lines, an immortalized normal human mammary epithelial cell line, and
progenitor-enriched primary normal human mammary epithelial cells. From these
comparisons, we found some compounds that kill breast cancer cells, but not their
normal epithelial counterparts, suggesting their potential for targeted therapy. One of
these compounds, N2-(3-pyridylmethyl)-5-nitro-2-furamide (Centrosome Clustering
Chemical Inhibitor-01, CCCI-01), that showed the greatest differential response in
this screen was confirmed to have selective effects on cancer as compared to normal
breast progenitors using more precise apoptosis induction and clonogenic growth
endpoints. The concentration of CCCI-01 that killed cancer cells in the clonogenic assay
spared normal human bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors in the colony-forming
cell assay, indicating a potential therapeutic window for CCCI-01, whose selectivity
might be further improved by optimizing the compound. Immunofluorescence analysis
showed that treatment with CCCI-01 lead to multipolar spindles in BT-549, while
maintaining bipolar spindles in the normal primary human mammary epithelial cells.
Since centrosome clustering is a complex process involving multiple pathways, the 14
compounds identified in this study provide a potentially novel means to developing
non-cross-resistant anti-cancer drugs that block centrosome clustering.

INTRODUCTION

identified 14 new active compounds, which were further
examined for their cytotoxicity in cancer and normal cells.
N2-(3-pyridylmethyl)-5-nitro-2-furamide, which we have
named Centrosome Clustering Chemical Inhibitor-01
(CCCI-01), showed the most promising differential effects
between cancer and normal cells. CCCI-01 treatment
resulted in multipolar spindles in nearly 90% of BT549 cells, while freshly isolated normal primary human
mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) maintained bipolar
spindles. These findings demonstrate the utility of this
approach to the development of a new type of cancerspecific therapeutics and for advancing our knowledge of
the biological functions of genes required for mitosis.

Bipolar spindle formation is crucial for correct
segregation of duplicated chromosomes into two
daughter cells during cell division. Centrosomes are
microtubule organizing centers and serve as poles of
spindles during mitosis. In most animal cells, there are
only two centrosomes that form two poles of a bipolar
spindle during mitosis. In contrast, many cancer types
are known to contain more than two or “supernumerary”
centrosomes [1, 2]. Supernumerary centrosomes can
result in extra spindle poles, which in turn could lead to
multipolar cell division with significant chromosome missegregation or cell cycle arrest, followed by cell death
[3, 4]. To avoid detrimental multipolar divisions, cancer
cells use mechanisms to assemble centrosomes into two
functional poles so that bipolar spindles can be formed
[5]. This process is called centrosome clustering. Genomewide RNAi screens carried out in Drosophila S2 cells and
a human oral cancer cell line revealed a large number of
pathways and genes involved in centrosome clustering [6,
7]. Various molecular regulators for clustering dependent
adaptation process have been identified and include motor
proteins, centrosomal proteins, kinetochore proteins,
spindle assembly checkpoint proteins, sister chromatid
cohesion proteins, chromosomal passenger complex
members, microtubule associated proteins and components
of the actin cytoskeleton [5-8].
While microtubule-targeting anti-mitotic drugs are
important components of many cancer chemotherapy
regimens, these drugs also hinder mitosis and alter
microtubule dynamics in normal cells leading to adverse
side effects such as myelosuppression, neurotoxicity,
gastrointestinal symptoms and alopecia [9]. Since
supernumerary centrosomes are common in cancer cells
but not in healthy cells, targeting centrosome clustering
has been suggested as a strategy to obtain greater cancerspecificity [10, 11] and recent studies have shown that
blocking centrosome clustering can be effective in killing
cancer cells, while sparing normal cells in vitro [6, 8, 12,
13] and in vivo [13]. An anti-fungal agent, Griseofulvin,
which binds to tubulins [14-16] and shows anti-tumor
activity [17], was identified in a fungal extract library
screen for molecules that inhibit centrosome clustering
[12]. We have previously shown that QLT-0267, which
is an inhibitor of the focal adhesion and centrosomal
protein, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) [18, 19], is another
compound that can inhibit centrosome coalescence
[8]. The discovery of structurally different molecular
regulators of this process suggests possible additional
opportunities to identify cancer cell-specific druggable
targets with reduced undesirable side effects.
In this study, we carried out a high-content screen of
a chemical library composed of pure drug-like compounds
to discover novel small molecules that inhibit centrosome
clustering in cancer cells. Through our screen, we

RESULTS
High-content screen to identify small molecules
that inhibit centrosome clustering in cancer cells
with supernumerary centrosomes
We developed a cell-based high-throughput screen
to discover small molecules that can block centrosome
clustering using the human BT-549 breast cancer cell
line as the testing platform. BT-549 cells were chosen
because they contain supernumerary centrosomes that
cluster into two poles to form bipolar spindles when they
divide [6, 8]. A chemical collection consisting of > 5,000
small molecules with drug-like structures was screened.
Cells were incubated in 96-well plates overnight,
exposed to each test compound at a final concentration
of approximately 17 µM for five to seven hours, and then
fixed with paraformaldehyde. Cells were then labeled
with TG-3, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes
phosphorylated form of nucleolin that peaks during
mitosis and therefore is a marker for mitosis [20, 21],
anti-pericentrin to visualize the centrosomes and Hoechst
33342 to stain the DNA. Images were automatically
acquired from three channels (to detect Hoechst, TG-3 and
pericentrin) per field and 15 fields per well of each 96-well
plate using a Cellomics Array Scan VTI microscope.
For automated data analysis, the Thermo Scientific
Compartmental Analysis algorithm was employed
(Methods) (Figure 1A-C). The total number of cells was
obtained by enumerating nuclei in the Hoechst channel
(orange or blue nucleus outline; Figure 1A and A’). The
total number of mitotic cells was obtained by counting
TG-3 positive cells (green circles, Figure 1B) in the TG-3
channel. The mitotic index (percentage of cells in mitosis)
was calculated based on the total number of cells and TG-3
positive mitotic cells. Mitotic cells with more than two
centrosome foci detected in the pericentrin channel were
considered to have de-clustered centrosomes (arrowheads,
Figure 1C and C’). The percentage of mitotic cells with
de-clustered centrosomes was calculated by dividing the

number of mitotic cells with de-clustered centrosomes
by the total number of mitotic cells. Eight wells of each
96-well plate received no chemicals and were treated as
negative controls. The distribution for the frequency of
mitotic cells with de-clustered centrosomes in a test group
was similar to that for negative control, except for some

wells showing higher scores (representative results of a
primary screen; Figure 1D). Test compounds scoring
higher than the plate average + 2.5 x the standard deviation
were considered as hits. When a score was near this cut-off
value, the mitotic index was taken into consideration, since
centrosome de-clustering often induces mitotic arrest [6-8,

distribution of mitotic cells with de-clustered centrosomes for the test group is similar to that for the untreated group except that it displays
additional high scores. Those compounds that increased the score by at least 2.5x the standard deviation were considered “hits” and were
subjected to a secondary screen. (E) Representative results of a secondary screen. Four different concentrations (27 , 9, 2.7 and 0.9 µM)

12]. Out of 5,440 compounds tested in primary screens,
we identified 88 (1.6%) primary hits (Table 1). To confirm
their activity, positive compounds were tested in a dilution
series (0.9, 2.7, 9.0 and 27 µM) in duplicates in the same
assay. A result of such a secondary screen is shown in
Figure 1E as an example. In this case, compounds B, C,
D and G were considered as active compounds, since they
increased the frequency of mitotic cells with de-clustered
centrosomes. These four compounds also induced mitotic
arrest (Figure 1E). In addition to the automated analysis,
all images from hits were visually examined to ensure that
staining or imaging artifacts were excluded. For instance,
compound F in Figure 1E indicated higher de-clustering
and mitotic index, but these were due to fluorescent debris

present in the well. Out of 88 primary hits examined, 18
compounds were confirmed as active in secondary screens.
We further examined these small molecules (in total of 17
compounds as one compound was no longer available) in
detail under standard culture conditions.

did not have this extra carbon, indicating that the spacing
between the two ring systems is important for activity.
These inactive compounds will be useful for future
detailed structure-activity relationship analyses.
All active compounds were examined for spindle
polarity, centrosome clustering and chromosome
alignment in BT-549 cells grown in a standard 6-well
format. Cells were treated with 10-30 µM of compounds
for five hours and then subjected to immunofluorescence
microscopy for tubulin and pericentrin. DMSO-treated
cells served as negative controls and generally formed
morphologically normal bipolar spindles with well defined
metaphase plates (Figure 3A). Treatment with 10 µM of

We compared structures of active compounds and
identified three compounds (named CCCI-01, 02 and 03,
Figure 2) that shared structural similarity. Another eight
related small molecules (Supplemental Figure 1) did not
prevent centrosome clustering in the primary screen. The
5-nitro-2-furamide moiety, circled in blue (Supplemental
Figure 1), is also present in some inactive compounds,
indicating that this group alone is not sufficient to prevent
centrosome clustering. The three active compounds have
a 5- or 6-membered ring separated from the 5-nitro-2-

an immortalized normal mammary epithelial cell line. *P < 0.005 (compared to normal cells), student’s t-test. (B) MTT assay was carried

compare cytotoxicity in different types of cancer. IC50 values for cancer cells were between 2 and 8 µM, while that for primary HMEC was
above 10 µM. P < 0.001 for BT-549 at 1-10 µM; P = 0.045 and P < 0.005 for MDA-MB-231 at 1 µM and 3-10 µM, respectively; P < 0.02

flow cytometry was carried out in BT-549 treated with 5 µM CCCI-01. Mitotic arrest represented by the increased G2/M population was
observed with CCCI-01 treatment, while the G1 population decreased. Apoptosis, the sub-G1 population, was elevated in the presence of
CCCI-01 with prolonged treatment. The distribution of S phase population remained similar, indicating there were no significant effects on
DNA synthesis by CCCI-01. DMSO had essentially no effects on these peaks (Supplemental Figure 3). A representative result from three
independent experiments is shown. (D) Apoptosis was examined by Cell Death Detection ELISA (Roche). BT-549 and MCF-10A were
treated with CCCI-01 or DMSO for 19 hours. Values were normalized (= 0) to the highest DMSO concentration (0.1 %) applied for CCCI01 treatment. The level of apoptosis was increased in BT-549 as low as at 3 µM, while apoptosis was not induced in MCF-10A even at 10
µM. This assay was carried out three times, and produced consistent results. A representative result is presented. *P < 0.01, student’s t-test.

CCCI-01, 02 and 03, shown as examples, increased the
incidence of de-clustered centrosomes with multipolar
spindles and highly disorganized chromosome
arrangements (Figure 3A). Quantitative analysis of
centrosome de-clustering was carried out according
to Fielding et al. [8]. The results showed that the three
similar compounds (Figure 2) increased the frequency
of mitotic cells with de-clustered centrosomes from 15%
to about 90% (P < 0.03, Figure 3B). In the primary and
secondary screens, all three compounds, CCCI-01, 02
and 03, arrested cells in mitosis (Figure 1E, compounds
B, C and D, respectively; data not shown for the primary
screen).
Out of 17 active compounds examined, 14
compounds were confirmed to prevent centrosome
clustering and induce multipolar spindles and disorganized
chromosome alignment (data not shown). Interestingly, the
compounds that did not increase mitotic indices turned
out to be false positives, confirming previous reports that
interference with centrosome clustering often results in
prolonged mitosis [6-8].

Effects of active compounds on viability in cancer
and normal cells
In order to compare the effects of the inhibitors of
centrosome clustering on cancer versus normal breast
cells, we carried out the MTT assay to measure cell yields
after two days of compound treatment. As representative
of normal cells, five primary normal human mammary
epithelial cells (HMEC; passage 0) isolated by fluorescent
activated cell sorting (FACS) from five different reduction
mammoplasty samples, and MCF-10A cells which are
widely used as an immortalized “normal” human breast
cell line were tested. A dilution series of CCCI-01 ranging
from 0.1 to 100 µM was examined. As shown in Figure 4A,
CCCI-01 inhibited the viability of BT549 breast cancer
cells at much lower concentrations compared to normal
epithelial cells. Accordingly, we examined its effects in
greater detail. To assess its effects on other different tumor
cell types, we extended our studies to MDA-MB-231 cells,
another breast cancer cell line, A-549, a lung cancer cell
line, and HCT-116, a colon cancer cell line. IC50 values
for primary HMEC and normal MCF-10A were greater
than 10 µM, while that for BT-549 was less than 3 µM,
providing a greater than 3-fold therapeutic window in
this in vitro assay (Figure 4A and B). In general, CCCI01 more effectively inhibited the growth of various
cancer cells compared to the normal cells. Interestingly,
the degree of cytotoxicity varied among different cancer
cell lines (IC50 for BT-549, 3 µM; MDA-MB-231, 8 µM;
A-549 and HCT-116, 6 µM), indicating involvement of
different mechanisms for the survival of different cancer
cells.
Each active compound validated from our screen

independent experiments. P, student’s t-test. The blue line in

1 µM, and colony size and number were reduced in both samples
at 10 µM. BFU-E/CFU-E colonies did not seem to be affected
up to 3 µM, and showed inhibition in colony formation at 10
µM in both samples. The blue line in the graph indicates IC50.

was tested on primary normal HMEC (passage 0) from at
least two different reduction mammoplasty samples and
two breast cancer cell lines, BT-549 and MDA-MB-231.
All of the 14 active compounds reduced cell viability
in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplemental
Figure 2 for CCCI-01, 02 and 03; unpublished data for
other compounds) while DMSO treatment had little
or no effect on the yield of any of the cells tested in
this assay (Supplemental Figure 2). However, of these
14 compounds, CCCI-01, 02 and 03 showed the most
differential effects on the viability of various cancer cell
lines and the normal cells (Supplemental Figure 2). Of
these three nitrofuramide compounds, CCCI-01 showed
the greatest differential response.

(Compound B in Figure 1E is CCCI-01). The S phase
population seemed unaffected, indicating that CCCI-01
does not block DNA synthesis. The sub-G1 population,
which represents apoptotic cells, increased with prolonged
CCCI-01 treatment, while DMSO had no effects on this
peak (Supplemental Figure 3). These results demonstrate
that CCCI-01 reduced viability of BT-549 by combination
of mitotic arrest and cell death.

Induction of apoptosis by CCCI-01 in BT-549 cells
but not in normal MCF-10A cells
To analyze selective cytotoxicity of CCCI-01
against cancer, we next compared induction of apoptosis
in cancerous BT-549 and normal MCF-10A using Cell
Death Detection ELISA (see Methods) which measures
fragmented nucleosomes in the cytoplasm associated
with apoptosis. After 19 hours of incubation with 3 µM of
CCCI-01, the level of apoptosis was significantly elevated
in BT-549 cells (Figure 4D), without further increases with
higher concentrations. In contrast, in MCF-10A, apoptosis
was not increased even at 10 µM. These data demonstrate
selective induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells
relative to normal mammary epithelial cells, likely due to
failure of bipolar mitosis resulting from centrosome declustering.

Effects of CCCI-01 on cell cycle and viability of
BT-549 cancer cells
To examine further properties of CCCI-01 on cell
viability, we analyzed cell cycle and cell death in BT549 by flow cytometry. Cells were treated with 5 µM
of CCCI-01 and were examined for their DNA content
over a period of time (Figure 4C). CCCI-01 treatment
increased the number of cells in G2/M phase compared to
the DMSO control. This is consistent with our screening
data that showed mitotic arrest by CCCI-01 treatment
with increased TG-3 labeling, a marker for mitotic cells

arrangement and spindle multipolarity were examined by immunofluorescence after treating cells with CCCI-01 for 5 hours. As little as 5
µM increased centrosome de-clustering to 70 % in BT-549 breast cancer cells (average of two independent experiments, at least 30 mitotic
cells/treatment/experiment). In contrast, even at 8 µM, de-clustering was not induced (P > 0.7, student’s t-test) in normal primary HMEC
from three different reduction mammoplasty samples (average of two independent experiments with three HMEC samples in total, at least
30 mitotic cells/treatment/sample). Scale bar = 10 µm. *P < 0.02, student’s t-test.

assay of normal bone marrow cells is often used to predict
the severity of myelosuppression caused by inhibition
of hematopoietic progenitor activity [23]. Therefore, we
examined cytotoxic effects of CCCI-01 in the CFC assay
using primary normal bone marrow cells. Due to limited
availability of normal bone marrows, CCCI-01 was tested
on samples from two healthy donors: one was selected
for hematopoietic progenitors (CD34 positive cells) and
the other was unselected (Figure 5B and C, separate data
available in Supplemental Table 1). Cells were plated in
methylcellulose-based media (STEMCELL Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada) with varying concentrations of CCCI01 and colonies were evaluated after culturing for 15
or 16 days. Up to 1 µM of CCCI-01, no changes in the
number and size of CFU-G/M colonies were detected in
both samples. At 3 µM, reduction in the CFU-G/M colony
number was observed in one sample but not in the other.
At 10 µM, proliferation of CFU-G/M was inhibited in both
samples. The number of BFU-E/CFU-E colonies was not
affected up to 3 µM, and reduction was observed at 10
µM. IC50 values for CFU-G/M and BFU-E/CFU-E were
approximately 10 µM when averaged. Considering IC50 of
CCCI-01 for BT-549 in clonogenic assay was below 0.3
µM, CCCI-01 may exert minimal toxic effects to normal
myeloproliferative cells in the concentration ranges that

Next, we compared the effects of CCCI-01 on BT549 cancer cells and MCF-10A normal cells in clonogenic
assays [22]. Single cells were plated and cultured for 9
days with varying concentrations of CCCI-01 (Figure
5A). At 0.3 µM, BT-549 colony formation was reduced
by 60 % (P = 0.03), while MCF-10A colony yields were
unaffected (P = 0.48, Figure 5A). When the concentration
was increased to 1 µM, colony formation by BT-549 cells
was completely inhibited. In contrast, colony formation by
MCF-10A cells was reduced by only 60 % (P < 0.003, BT549 vs. MCF-10A). This shows that CCCI-01 selectively
inhibits the ability of BT-549 clonogenic cells to undergo
more than five divisions as compared to normal MCF-10A
cells.

immunofluorescence after treating cells with Inactive-A or E or CCCI-01. Inactive-A and E did not inhibit centrosome clustering even at

Inactive-A and E up to 10 µM, while at this concentration, CCCI-01 reduced the cell viability to less than 10 %. At 30 µM, Inactive-A and
E showed some cytotoxicity, but this is not caused by centrosome de-clustering as centrosomes did not display scattered configuration at
this concentration (see Figure 6B). Average of three independent experiments.

some cytotoxicity was detected in Inactive-A or E treated
cells, but this was not caused by centrosome de-clustering
as centrosomes and spindles appeared unaffected at this
concentration (Figure 7B). These results suggest that
CCCI-01, 02 and 03 reduce viability of BT-549 cells
through inhibition of centrosome clustering. Our structureactivity relationship analysis suggests that the 5-nitro-2furamide (circled in blue in Supplemental Figure 1), a
common structure in these active and inactive compounds,
alone is not sufficient for inhibiting centrosome clustering
and that the spacing between the 5-nitro-2-furamide and a
5- or 6-membered ring may be important for their activity.

No induction of multipolar spindle in primary
human mammary epithelial cells purified from
reduction mammoplasties
Although normal cells contain only two
centrosomes, it is possible that CCCI-01 induces
fragmentation of normal centrosomes resulting in
multipolar spindle formation. Therefore immunolabeling
was performed to evaluate the spindle and centrosome
arrangement in normal primary HMECs treated with
5 or 8 µM of CCCI-01. BT-549 cells were also tested
to see if these lower concentrations can interfere with
centrosome organization during mitosis. Even at 8 µM,
the higher concentration tested, most spindles were
bipolar with two poles labeled by anti-pericentrin, and
chromosomes were aligned at the metaphase plate in
primary HMECs (passage 0) isolated from three different
reduction mammoplasty samples (Figure 6). As expected,
for the rare mitotic primary normal cells that did form
multipolar spindles, this was not specific to either DMSO
or CCCI-01 treatment (P > 0.7). In contrast, 5 µM CCCI01 was sufficient to induce multipolar spindles in BT-549
cells (Figure 6). The frequency of BT-549 cells with declustered centrosomes was increased from a base value of
17 %, observed in the negative control, to 68 % and 86 %
in the presence of 5 µM and 8 µM CCCI-01, respectively
(P < 0.02). This shows that treatment with CCCI-01 leads
to multipolar spindles in BT-549 cells, but not in primary
normal cells which are unlikely to rely on centrosome
clustering for bipolar spindle formation.

DISCUSSION
Targeting molecular processes that are selectively
required by cancer cells to maintain their survival but
not by normal cells, offers an ideal strategy to retain a
therapeutic effect while reducing or eliminating side
effects. There are only two centrosomes in normal cells
during mitosis, whereas supernumerary centrosomes are
very common in solid and hematological tumors [1].
Targeting the ability of supernumerary centrosomes to
coalesce selectively inhibits cancer cell proliferation in
vitro [6, 8, 12], suggesting centrosome clustering could
be an attractive target for cancer-specific therapy. Here we
carried out a high-content screen and identified 14 novel
compounds that inhibited centrosome clustering. Some of
these compounds were analyzed for their ability to act on
centrosomes during mitosis and for their cytotoxicity in
cancer and primary normal cells. These analyses lead to
the identification of a class of nitrofuramide compounds
represented by three distinct small molecules which show
a differential killing between cancer and normal cells.

Analyses of inactive versus active compounds

Possible dependence of different cancer cells on
different mechanisms to cluster centrosomes

To narrow down active groups in CCCI-01, 02
and 03, we examined two analogues, Inactive-A and
E (Figure 7A), that appeared inactive from the primary
screen (Supplemental Figure 1). First, their effects on
spindle formation were assessed by immunefluorescence
microscopy in BT-549 cells treated with compounds
for 5 hours. While 5 µM of CCCI-01 was sufficient to
increase the frequency of mitotic cells with de-clustered
centrosomes to over 70 %, Inactive-A and E did not lead
to fragmentation or de-clustering of centrosomes even at
30 µM (Figure 7B), confirming the result of the primary
screen. If these inactive compounds exhibit minimal
toxicity to BT-549, it implies that the cytotoxicity caused
by CCCI-01, 02 and 03 was due to multipolar spindle
formation with de-clustered centrosomes. Therefore we
analyzed the cell viability in BT-549 cells by MTT assays.
After two days of compound treatment, the inactive
compounds did not show cytotoxicity even at 10 µM,
however CCCI-01reduced the cell viability to 10 % at
10 µM. When the concentration was increased to 30 µM,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Genome-wide RNAi screens in Drosophila and
human cells revealed multiple pathways required for
centrosome clustering [6, 7]. The MTT assay of active
compounds revealed a variable degree of cytotoxicity
among different cancer cell lines. For instance, BT-549
cells are more sensitive to CCCI-01 than MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 4B), whereas BT-549 cells appear less
sensitive to a structurally distinct active compound, as
compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (unpublished data) in
spite of the fact that approximately 45 % of cells in both
lines contain extra centrosomes [6]. Thus the frequency of
cells with extra centrosomes is not the sole determinant of
the degree of cytotoxicity of these compounds in human
cancer cells, suggesting different mechanisms are involved
in clustering supernumerary centrosomes in different
cancer cell types, even when they originate from the same
tissue. Further characterization of the various classes

nature of these mechanisms and improve the development
of this approach to selectively target cancer cells.

Centrosome de-clustering
fragmentation

and

µM did not seem to alter centrosome organization of
interphase cells (Supplemental Figure 4). This suggests
that CCCI-01 inhibits centrosome clustering in a mitosisspecific manner. CCCI-01 may target a protein that is
highly expressed during mitosis or has a mitosis-specific
function. Concentrations higher than 30 µM caused severe
cell detachment from the substratum within 5 hours,
indicating general cytotoxicity of this compound at these
higher concentrations.
Our MTT assay, clonogenic assay and CFC assay
showed that the nitrofuramide CCCI-01 selectively
affected the survival and/or proliferation of several
types of cancer cells while sparing normal cells. The
apoptosis assay results further demonstrated that
apoptosis was increased in BT-549 but not in MCF-10A
cells by CCCI-01. These data indicate that this class of
small molecules, especially CCCI-01, is selectively
cytotoxic in cancer cells. Based on our flow cytometry
analysis (Figure 4C), cytotoxicity of CCCI-01 is likely
to be brought on by a combination of cell death and cell
cycle arrest. Our structure-activity relationship analysis
suggests that cytotoxicity caused by CCCI-01, 02 and 03
is due to centrosome de-clustering and that the spacing
between the 5-nitro-2-furamide, a common structure in
these compounds, and a 5- or 6-membered ring may be
important for their activity (Figure 7).

centrosome

True centrosomes contain a pair of centrioles
surrounded by pericentriolar material, PCM, while
acentriolar centrosomes lack centrioles and can be formed
by fragmentation of PCM [1, 24]. About half of BT-549
cells are known to contain extra true centrosomes [6].
Many of our active compounds showed higher than 50%
of de-clustered mitotic cell population. This indicates
that some multipolar spindle poles were anchored to
acentriolar centrosomes. Such defects are known to be
induced by knockdown of Aurora-A [25], an extensively
studied oncogene involved in multiple steps of mitosis
[26], and depletion of Cep57 [27], a centrosomal protein
with microtubule bundling activity [28]. It has been
suggested that acentrosomal and centrosomal poles need
to be clustered to assemble bi-polar spindles in cancer
cells with normal number of bona fide centrosomes [29].
This pole focusing mechanism is dependent on HSET, a
kinesin involved in centrosome clustering in cancer cells
but is dispensable in normal cells [6, 29]. It is also possible
that these compounds cause abnormal centriole splitting
leading to a centrosome with only one centriole instead
of a pair of centrioles. Abnormal centriole disengagement
accompanied by multipolar spindle formation has
been reported for RNAi of Astrin [30] or Akt kinase–
interacting protein 1 [31], which are both important for the
maintenance of centrosome integrity. Another possibility
is that cells with de-clustered centrosomes were effectively
arrested in mitosis, resulting in a selective accumulation of
such mitotic cells. We speculate, however, that a five-hour
incubation with test compounds cannot account for this
substantial increase. Most importantly, we did not detect
centrosome fragmentation in normal primary HMEC
treated with CCCI-01. This suggests that this compound
targets a mechanism that BT-549 cells, but not healthy
primary cells, rely on for the maintenance of centrosome
integrity.

Centrosome de-clustering and mitotic arrest
All of our active compounds increased mitotic
indices, confirming previous reports that centrosome declustering often results in mitotic arrest [6-8, 12]. It has
been reported that spindle assembly checkpoint halts
entry to anaphase until adequate spindles are established
in cells with supernumerary centrosomes [6]. Depletions
of certain proteins, however, do not arrest cells in mitosis
while inducing multipolar spindle formation [7]. Some
of these proteins are chromosomal passenger proteins,
Aurora-B, Borealin, INCENP and Survivin [7]. Since our
active compounds prolonged mitosis, it is unlikely that
their targets are these chromosomal passenger proteins.
Through our high-content screen, we identified
14 novel compounds that inhibit centrosome clustering
or induce centrosome fragmentation. One of the active
compounds was examined in detail and showed selective
cytotoxicity to cancer cells over primary normal cells.
This study is an initial step in the development of various
classes of drugs that block centrosome clustering through
different pathways with opportunities for improving their
activity and specificity through medicinal chemistry.
Future studies will be aimed at identifying potential
cellular targets of CCCI-01, 02 and 03 and determining
the in vivo pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity, and
efficacies of these compounds in models on tumor growth.
The studies represented here provide a promising novel

Potential mechanisms of action of CCCI-01
CCCI-01 does not seem to induce obvious
centrosome abnormalities in interphase BT-549 cells
(Supplemental Figure 4). In contrast, Griseofulvin is
known to bind to tubulin [14-16] and to inhibit centrosome
coalescence in interphase cells [12]. Interphase cells
treated with 10 µM CCCI-01, which resulted in over 90
% of de-clustering in mitotic cells, typically contained
only one centrosome dot per cell, similar to DMSO
control. Increasing the concentration to 20 µM or 40

Aldrich) in PBS for 30 minutes. Mouse TG-3 [20]
and rabbit anti-pericentrin (AbCam, Cambridge, UK)
were applied to the samples (1/200 and 1/2000 in PBS,
respectively) overnight at 4 ºC. Secondary antibodies (goat
anti-mouse Alexa 568 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488, Life
Technologies) were incubated with cells (1/500 in PBS)
for one hour at room temperature. Cells were stained with
500 ng/ml Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) for 10
minutes. Immunolabelled samples were stored in PBS at
4 ºC until further examination.
For secondary screening, a dilution series of
compounds as well as corresponding concentrations of
DMSO was examined in duplicates. Cells were processed
as described above.

METHODS
Cell lines
BT-549 cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and 0.023 IU/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA). MDA-MB-231 and A-549 cells were cultured
in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10%
FBS. HCT-116 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5a (Life
Technologies) with 10% FBS. MCF-10A cells were
cultured according to Imbalzano et al. [32]. All cell lines
were obtained from ATCC.

Image acquisition and data analysis
A Cellomics Array Scan VTI (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) fluorescent imaging system equipped
with a Caliper robotic plate loader (PerkinElmer) was used
for automated image acquisition. Fifteen fields with three
channels, Hoechst for DNA stain, TG-3 for mitotic cell
detection, and pericentrin for centrosome detection, were
imaged for each well using a 10x objective. Each field was
auto-focused to ensure clear image acquisition.
For data analysis, Thermo Scientific Compartmental
Analysis algorithm (Thermo Scientific) was employed.
Cell nuclei were identified (Figure 1A) and a border
was introduced by expanding 5 pixels outward from the
nuclear boundary to define a region of interest (ROI). If
the mean pixel intensity of TG-3 labeling within the ROI
was above a threshold, the cell was considered to be in
mitosis (blue circles for nuclear boundary of mitotic cells
and green circles for ROI in Figure 1B and C). Those cells
below the threshold were considered non-mitotic and
the nuclear boundary was drawn in orange (Figure 1AC). The number of pericentrin foci within the ROI (light
blue dots, Figure 1C) was automatically counted. When
centrosome foci within the ROI were more than two, the
cell was considered to have de-clustered centrosomes. The
percentage of mitotic cells with de-clustered centrosomes
was determined for each treatment. In addition, mitotic
index (% of cells in mitosis) was obtained by dividing
the number of TG-3 positive cells by the total number of
nuclei identified in the Hoechst channel.

Primary human mammary epithelial (HMEC)
cells
Ten histologically normal discard tissue samples
from healthy women undergoing reduction mammoplasty
surgery were collected with informed consent approved
by the University of British Columbia Research Ethics
Board. Single mammary cells were prepared [33, 34] and
proliferative epithelial cells were enriched using a 3-day
pre-culture method described previously (Supplemental
Figure 5) [35]. Cells were trypsinized and viable
HMECs isolated by FACS were cultured in DMEM/
F12 supplemented with 10 ng/ml epidermal growth
factor, 10 ng/ml cholera toxin, 1 µg/ml insulin, 0.5 µg/ml
hydrocortisone and 5% FBS, overnight, prior to compound
treatment.

Small molecules
All compounds used in this study were purchased
from Maybridge (Cambridge, UK). Stock solutions in
DMSO were stored at -20 ºC.

Sample preparation for high-content screening

Immunofluorescence microscopy under standard
culture conditions

BT-549 cells were cultured in 96-well plates suitable
for fluorescence analysis (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA,
USA), overnight. Test compounds were delivered to
each well using a robotic pinning instrument that gave
a final concentration of approximately 17 µM of each
compound. Cells were incubated with small molecules
for five to seven hours, fixed with pre-warmed 4 %
paraformaldehyde with 0.1 % triton X-100 in PBS for
15 minutes, and then incubated with 1 % BSA (Sigmawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates
overnight, treated with compounds for 5 hours, fixed
with cold methanol for 10 minutes, and subjected to
immunolabeling according to Dobreva et al. [36]. Primary
antibodies used were mouse DM1A anti-α-tubulin (SigmaAldrich) and rabbit anti-pericentrin (Abcam, Cambridge,
1773

Oncotarget 2013; 4:

MA, USA) at 1/1000 and 1/2000, respectively. Goat
anti-mouse Alexa 594 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488
(Life Technologies) were applied at 1/400 as secondary
antibodies. Cells were mounted in ProLong Gold
mounting media (Life Technologies).
Specimens were imaged and analyzed under
an epifluorescence microscope, Colibri (Carl Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany). Images were acquired with an
AxioCam HRc camera and AxioVision 3.1 software (Carl
Zeiss), and brightness/contrast was adjusted using ImageJ
(NIH).
Centrosome de-clustering was analyzed based on
Fielding et al. [8]. Centrosome number and arrangement,
spindle polarity, and chromosome alignment were
examined, and the frequency of mitotic cells with declustered centrosomes was determined.

Apoptosis assay

The MTT assay

Clonogenic assays were carried out according
to Franken et al. [22]. In brief, BT-549 and MCF-10A
cells were trypsinized to obtain single cell suspensions
and seeded at 100 and 50 cells/well in 6-well plates,
respectively. Cells were let to adhere for several hours,
and CCCI-01 or DMSO was applied. All treatments
with CCCI-01 received 0.06 % of DMSO. After 9 days
of incubation, cells were fixed and colonies consisting of
more than 50 cells were enumerated for each treatment.

Quantification of cytoplasmic nucleosomes was
carried out using Cell Death Detection ELISA (Roche,
Basel, Switzaland). BT-549 and MCF-10A cells were
seeded at 1.5 x 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. Cells were
let to adhere for several hours, and then treated with a
dilution series of CCCI-01. The highest concentration
of DMSO (0.1 %) applied for CCCI-01 treatment was
included to assess the solo effect of DMSO. After 19
hours of incubation, cells were spun down at 200 g for 10
min, and processed for cytoplasmic nucleosome detection
according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Clonogenic assay

BT-549, MDA-MB-231, A-549, HCT-116, MCF10A cell lines and freshly isolated normal primary HMECs
(passage 0) were examined. Cells (2,000 cells/90 µl/well)
were plated in 96-well plates for several hours to allow
adhesion to the plates for established cell lines. Primary
HMEC were cultured overnight in 96-well plates (5,000
cells/90 µl/well) following isolation by FACS. A dilution
series of compounds was prepared with appropriate media,
added to the cell culture (10 µl/well) and incubated for
two days.
For the MTT assay, 10 µl of 5 mg/ml thiazolyl blue
tetrazolium bromide in PBS was applied to each well and
incubated for four hours. 100 µl of solubilization solution
(10% SDS and 0.01N HCl) was added and the plates
were kept in the incubator overnight. OD were measured
at 570 nm and 660 nm by a spectrophotometer. A570 was
subtracted from A660, and the values were normalized to
the negative control without DMSO.

The CFC assay using primary normal bone
marrow cells
Bone marrow samples were collected from the
iliac crest of healthy donors with informed consent and
the procedure was approved by the University of British
Columbia Research Ethics Board. Mononuclear cells were
isolated with Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma-Aldrich) density
gradient separation and CD34+ cells were selected by
EasySep CD34 positive selection kit (STEMCELL
Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). 10,000 monoculear
cells and 2,000 cells selected for CD34+ were plated in
methylcellulose media (MethoCult H4330 with EPO,
STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with cytokines
[37] and varying concentrations of CCCI-01 in duplicates,
and were cultured for 16 and 15 days, respectively.
All samples contained 0.1% DMSO, except for 0 µM
treatment that did not receive any DMSO. Colonies were
evaluated according to the manufacture’s instruction for
MethoCult (STEMCELL Technologies).

Cell cycle and cell death analyses using flow
cytometry
BT-549 cells were cultured with 5 µM CCCI-01 or
0.05% DMSO, and harvested by trypsinization at varying
time points. After a PBS wash, suspended cells were fixed
and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 ºC. Cells were stained with
20 µg/ml Propidium Iodide with 0.1 % TritonX-100 and
200 µg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS.
FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
with a 488nm laser and a 585/42 filter was used for the
detection of Propidium Iodide that stained DNA. 3,000
events were collected for each sample. Doublets were
eliminated based on their distribution in area vs. width
plots for Propidium Iodide signal, and the remaining
events as area were analyzed for cell cycle and apoptosis
using FlowJo (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).
