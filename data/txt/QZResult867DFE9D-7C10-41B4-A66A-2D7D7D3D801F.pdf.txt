ABSTRACT
An extremely high cancer incidence and the hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking
agents associated with Fanconi Anemia (FA) have marked it to be a unique genetic
model system to study human cancer etiology and treatment, which has emerged an
intense area of investigation in cancer research. However, there is limited information
about the relationship between the mutated FA pathway and the cancer development
or/and treatment in patients without FA. Here we analyzed the mutation rates of the
seventeen FA genes in 68 DNA sequence datasets. We found that the FA pathway
is frequently mutated across a variety of human cancers, with a rate mostly in the
range of 15 to 35 % in human lung, brain, bladder, ovarian, breast cancers, or others.
Furthermore, we found a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05) between the
mutated FA pathway and the development of human bladder cancer that we only
further analyzed. Together, our study demonstrates a previously unknown fact that
the mutated FA pathway frequently occurs during the development of non-FA human
cancers, holding profound implications directly in advancing our understanding of
human tumorigenesis as well as tumor sensitivity/resistance to crosslinking drugrelevant chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

the first time, demonstrated the tumor suppressor role of
the FA signaling pathway predicated in 1971 by Dr. Swift
[11]. To date, there are seventeen FA genes (FANC/A, B,
C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, G, L, M, N O, P, Q and S) that
have been identified [6, 7] and the functions of these
genes have emerged as an intense area of investigation
in cancer research [6, 9, 10, 12, 13]. It is not too hard
to recognize how important this signaling pathway is in
enhancing our understanding of human tumorigenesis.
However, the relevant knowledge of how the genetically
mutated FA pathway is involved in the development of
non-FA human cancers remains to be limited. Here we
report common occurrences of the mutated FA pathway
and its strong association with the development of human
bladder cancer that was only further analyzed. This study,
for the first time, demonstrated the importance of the FA
tumor suppressor pathway at the genetic level among the
general population.

Germline mutations in both alleles of a Fanconi
Anemia (FA) gene lead to FA, a rare human genetic
disease, which is also referred to a chromosomal
abnormality syndrome [1-5]. Homozygous germline
mutations in each individual FA gene account for a
corresponding FA complementation group. Common
features shared among all complementation groups
indicate that encoded proteins function in a similar or
common signaling transduction pathway, named the FA
pathway or the FA-BRCA pathway, in regard to the direct
or indirect involvement of breast cancer susceptibility
genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2 [6-8]. We recently reported that
the functional heterozygosity occurring in the FA signaling
pathway during the course of cancer development plays
a crucial role in promoting the development of human
cancer in patients without FA [9, 10]. These studies, for

RESULTS

the frequently mutated FA pathway as indicated (Table 1
and Supplementary Table 1) conveys its essential nature
in suppressing the development of human cancers in the
general population. Mutations occurring in any of the FA
genes certainly contribute to the genetic hetero- or homozygosity of a given individual FA gene, and hereafter
compromise the FA tumor suppressor signaling and
promote the development of non-FA human cancer.
To further understand the importance, at the genetic
level, of those detectable mutations in the FA pathway in
contributing to human tumorigenesis among the general
population, we asked how significant the rate of the
mutated FA pathway is during the development of human
bladder cancer by cross-referencing the available clinical
information, provided by the Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). We defined the mutated FA pathway, resulting
from mutations found in one or 2 to 17 FA genes known so
far; and the corresponding wild type FA pathway, meaning
that no mutations are found in any of the 17 FA genes.
We manually extracted the patient information of bladder
tumor stages from the clinic notes available on TCGA. As

The recent technological advances offer us research
tools that are much more articulated than what we could
imagine before. Whole metabolome, transcriptome or
genome analysis is of growing importance in advancing
our views on the cancer development and treatment [1416]. However, the annotation of the relationship between
the mutated FA pathway and human cancer in a genomewide manner is lacking. Here we analyzed a total of 68
publicly available DNA sequence datasets for mutations
occurring in the 17 FA genes and compounded a sum rate
for the mutated FA pathway via c-BioPortal [17, 18]. These
sum rates are scattered from 1 to 55% with a frequency
in a range of 15-35% (Table 1 and Supplementary Table
1). This is the first report to comprehensively show the
scale of detectable mutations in the FA pathway in nonFA human cancers, firmly supporting our prior report that
the FA tumor suppressor pathway plays a crucial role in
suppressing cancer development in the patients without
FA [9, 10]. Again, for the first time at the genetic level,

DISCUSSION

shown in Figure 1, the mutated FA pathway, in contrast to
the non-mutated one, is significantly correlated with the
tumor promotion with a p value = 0.044 (more tumor cases
at the high (late) stage when the FA pathway is mutated),
indicating the tumor suppressor role played by the nonmutated FA pathway during the development of human
bladder cancer. Next, we suspected this correlation might
be heavily attributed to the mutated pathway resulting
from multiple mutated FA genes, not the sole influence
of the mutated FA pathway, noting that each FA gene has
multiple functions in addition to its role in the FA pathway
[19-22]. We regrouped cases by counting the mutated FA
pathway resulting from a single mutated FA gene, and
found that this redefined mutated FA pathway remains
to be significantly correlated with tumor promotion (p =
0.032) (Figure 2). This further indicates the importance of
the FA tumor suppressor pathway during the development
of human bladder cancer. Our studies on human bladder
cancer once again genetically validate that the FA tumorsuppressor signaling is not restricted to the FA cells.

We here demonstrate a previously unrecognized fact
that the mutated FA pathway frequently occurs in the nonFA human tumors (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1).
We analyze the frequency of mutations to FA genes in the
FA pathway, by including point mutations, deletions, as
well as gene amplification events present in FANC/A, B,
C, D1/2, E, F, G, I, G, L, M, N O, P, Q or S [6, 7]. The
latter type of mutation might be subject to a point relevant
to an over-activating FA pathway, rather than the loss of
function. However the reported studies suggested that the
over-activated FA signaling is tumorigenic [13, 23] and,
thus, generally leads to the loss of tumor suppressive
effect as a point mutation or deletion would. As a matter of
fact, such scale rates of the mutated FA pathway occurring
in human cancers ascertain extreme importance of the FA
tumor suppressor pathway; once mutated, it promotes the
development of human cancer as indicated in Figures 1
and 2. Our studies and many others [9, 19, 24-26] showed
that somatic inactivation of the FA pathway could be at the

Figure 1: The mutated FA pathway is associated with the development of human bladder cancer. On the basis of the clinic
notes available for a set of human bladder cancer samples on TCGA, we divided this set of cancer samples into two groups with or without
a mutated FA pathway. We further divided each group into two subgroups upon tumor stages. We combined cases at the clinic stage 0, I, and
II as the low stage, and those at the clinic stage III and IV as the high stage considering the limited sample sizes. The top table shows the
distribution of bladder cancer cases in the groups we defined. The relative distribution of the mutated or non-mutated FA pathway in bladder
cancer was plotted in bars at the bottom to suggest the role of a mutated FA pathway is statistically significant in promoting tumor growth
from the low stage to the high stage in comparison with the wild type FA pathway. Chi-square test was performed with a p value = 0.044.

level of any FA proteins or others functionally relevant.
The compromised FA signaling pathway, if including
epigenetic modifications of the FA genes [27] and other
factors directly or indirectly on FA proteins [9, 28], would
have a much higher rate in non-FA cancer patients than
those accordingly shown in Table 1 and Supplementary
Table 1 only on the basis of mutations in the 17 FA genes.
The irreparable, accumulated DNA damage
contributes to the development of human cancer; on the
other hand, those accumulated DNA damage resulting from
cancer therapeutic agents [29-33], would be beneficial
to the outcome of cancer treatment. FA cells carrying a
defective FA pathway are sensitive to DNA crosslinking
agents and die over time [1-5]. Therefore, tumor cells,
harboring a mutated FA pathway, and eventually carrying
accumulated DNA damage, will die after the exposure
to therapeutic drugs [12, 34]. Consequently, the genetic
profiling of FA genes may be a strategy to predict the
sensitivity of cancer treatment. This would be very helpful

for avoiding the drawbacks of general therapies in clinic.
For instance, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) [35-37] is
given to patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
mainly as immunotherapy without prior knowledge of
clear functioning mechanisms. Ideally, BCG would be
administered only to those patients who do not carry
the mutated FA signaling and to give platinum-related
drugs to patients who would have functional hetero- or
homo-zygosity of the FA pathway (FA gene mutations,
oncogenic factors compromising FA signaling, etc.).
Looking at the explicit rates of the mutated FA pathway
in all types of human cancers (Table 1 and Supplementary
Table 1), there is a very low rate (<5%), for example, in
medulloblastoma. This could be a rational explanation
for the unclear benefit reported for medulloblastoma
chemotherapy in using a combination including cisplatin
or carboplatin [38]. Because of the low rate of the mutated
FA pathway in medulloblastoma (1.8 or 4.3%, calculated
from two separate datasets) (Supplementary Table 1),

Figure 2: The mutated FA pathway resulting only from one mutated FA gene appears to potently promotes the
development of human balder cancer. Bladder cancer cases were regrouped according to the mutated FA pathway harboring only
one of the mutated FA genes, accompanying the same criterion used previously (Figure 1) for the subgroups. The top table shows the
distribution of bladder cancer cases in each group we redefined. The relative distribution of the mutated or non-mutated FA pathway
in bladder cancer was plotted in bars at the bottom to suggest the role of a single mutated FA gene-containing pathway is statistically
significant in promoting tumor growth from the low stage to the high stage in contract to the wild type status of the FA pathway. Chi-square
test was conducted with a p value = 0.032.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

most tumor cells carrying a fully functioning FA pathway
genetically commit to repair the damaged DNA caused
by cisplatin or carboplatin and presumably continue to
proliferate.
The field of FA cancer research progresses rapidly,
and there are FA cases yet to be defined [39]. This may
raise an issue of how to accurately define the wild type
status of the FA pathway. We could have counted the
cases harboring mutations in any of unidentified FA
genes for the wild type group (Figures 1 and 2). However,
the wild type status of the FA pathway named upon no
mutation in any of the 17 FA genes would be the closest
condition we can possibly provide as far (Main functions
of the 17 genes outlined in Supplementary Table 2). Most
importantly, there is a statistically significant correlation
between the mutated FA pathway and the tumor promotion
of human bladder cancer in the settings we studied
(Figures 1 and 2), supporting the genetic evidence that
the FA pathway has a role as a tumor suppressor in nonFA individuals and further concurring with our studies
in this exciting field [9, 10, 12, 13, 21, 40-43]. While we
had an in-depth look at the mutated FA pathway causing
from only one mutated FA gene (Figure 2), we wanted to
see how the mutated FA pathway resulting from two or
more mutated FA genes is related to the tumor promotion.
Unfortunately, it did not show statistical significance in
terms of tumor promotion potentiated by the mutated
FA pathway, but remains to hold a higher tendency of
promoting tumor growth as compared to the wild type
pathway (2.4 folds versus 1.6 folds for tumors at the high/
late stage carrying the mutated or non-mutated status of
the pathway, respectively). This may result from a limited
sample size or/and the state of tumors that would have
entered into the phase of the highest malignancy at the
genetic level. In addition, owing to a tremendous amount
of time needed in manually extracting clinical information,
we did not go on performing similar analyses for other
types of cancers in this study. We believe the finding
would be similar to what shown in Figures 1 and 2,
indicating the importance, at the prospective of cancer
genetics [44, 45], of the tumor suppressor role played by
the FA pathway during the development of non-FA human
cancers. Of note, we realized that c-BioPortal does not
give the clear information whether the output mutations
affect both alleles or/and the all functions of any given
gene. Possibly, the given gene may have a certain level
of normal functions though mutated. Nonetheless, either
heterozygous or homozygous mutations occurring in FA
genes will compromise the tumor suppressor function of
the FA signaling pathway and promote the development
of human cancers. In fact, this has been evidenced by
numerous studies reporting an increased incidence of
breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer tightly
associated with the heterozygosity of several FA genes
(FANCD1, FANCJ, FANCN, FANCO or/and FANCS)
[22, 46-57].

Publicly available DNA sequence datasets
A total of 68 DNA sequence datasets were used
and analyzed upon the known 17 FA genes as far via
c-BioPortal [17, 18] to determine a mutation rate of the
FA pathway in a variety of human cancers. The sources
of those sequence datasets are TCGA, MSKCC, BGI,
BCCRC, Nature, Nature Genetics, Cell, Science, AMC,
Cancer Cell, and PNAS. The rates of the mutated
pathway were calculated upon 27 sequence datasets of
TCGA (Table 1), and others on the basis of 41 sequence
datasets available in the rest of resources herein stated
(Supplementary Table 1).

Source of clinic information of human bladder
cancer samples
The clinic information for a total of 206 human
bladder cancer cases was downloaded from TCGA
database (updated on Jan 17, 2015). The related
information for tumor stage according to The American
Joint Committee On Cancer (AJCC) was collected
manually and plotted as described in the text.

Statistical analysis
The correlation between the mutated FA pathway
and the cancer stage was analyzed using Chi-square test.
A p-value <0.05 was considered as statistical significance.
All analyses were processed by SPSS 20 software.
