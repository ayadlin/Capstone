SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

TP53 is commonly altered in human cancer, and Tp53 reactivation suppresses tumours invivo 1,2. This strategy has proven difficult to implement therapeutically, and here we have
examined an alternative strategy by manipulating the p53 family members, p63 and p73.
The TA isoforms of p63 and p73 structurally and functionally resemble p53, while the ΔN
isoforms of p63 and p73 are frequently overexpressed in cancer and act primarily in
dominant negative fashion against p53, TAp63, and TAp73 to inhibit their tumour
suppressive functions 3–8. The p53 family interacts extensively in cellular processes that
promote tumour suppression, such as apoptosis and autophagy9–14, thus a clear
understanding of this interplay in cancer is needed to treat tumours with alterations in the
p53 pathway. Here, we show that deletion of the ΔN isoforms of p63 or p73 leads to
metabolic reprogramming and regression of p53 deficient tumours through upregulation of
IAPP, the gene that encodes amylin, a 37 amino acid peptide cosecreted with insulin from
the β cells of the pancreas. We found that IAPP is causally involved in this tumour
regression and that amylin functions through the calcitonin receptor (CalcR) and receptor
activity modifying protein 3 (RAMP3) to inhibit glycolysis and induce ROS and apoptosis.
Pramlintide, a synthetic analog of amylin, which is currently used to treat type 1 and type 2
diabetes, caused rapid tumour regression in p53 deficient thymic lymphomas, representing a
novel strategy to target p53-deficient cancers.

Using ΔNp6315 and ΔNp73 conditional knock out mice (Extended Data Figure 1a & b), we
generated ΔNp63+/− and ΔNp73−/− mice (Extended Data Figure 1c–f). To ask whether the
ΔN isoforms of p63 and p73 act as oncogenes in vivo by interacting with p53, ΔNp63+/
−;p53−/− and ΔNp73−/−;p53−/− mice were aged for the development of thymic
lymphomas, which form in nearly all p53−/− mice16. We found a remarkable diminution in
the number and size of thymic lymphomas in ΔNp63+/−;p53−/− and ΔNp73−/−;p53−/−
mice leading to an extended lifespan (Extended Data Figure 2a–c) suggesting that the ΔN
isoforms of p63 and p73 restrain a tumour suppressive program that can compensate for p53
function.

Author Manuscript

We found that TAp63 and TAp73 were upregulated in thymic lymphomas from ΔNp63+/
−;p53−/− and ΔNp73−/−;p53−/− mice (Extended Data Figure 2d & e) along with an
upregulation of apoptosis (Extended Data Figure 2f–j) and senescence (Extended Data 2k–
o). We also examined thymocytes from 4 week old after treatment with 10 Gy gamma
irradiation, a dose that is known to elicit p53-dependent apoptosis 9,17. Indeed, TAp63 and
TAp73 are higher in ΔNp63+/−;p53−/− and ΔNp73−/−;p53−/− thymocytes, which was
further exacerbated after gamma irradiation (Extended Data Figure 3a–c) with an increase in
apoptosis (Extended Data Figure 3d–h) and senescence (Extended Data Figure 3i–m).
To determine whether TAp63 or TAp73 compensate for p53 function in tumours in-vivo, we
acutely remove ΔNp63 or ΔNp73 by intratumoral infection with adenovirus-cre-mCherry
(Extended Data Figure 4a–d and Figure 1a–f) in ΔNp63fl/fl;p53−/− and ΔNp73fl/fl;p53−/−
at 10 weeks of age. Tumours were 2.3–5.8 mm3 in size at the time of infection and
monitored weekly by MRI (Figure 1a–i). Mice deficient for either ΔNp63 or ΔNp73 and p53
showed marked decreases in tumour burden (Figure 1h & i). The reduction of ΔNp63 and

ΔNp73 expression resulted in increased expression of TAp63 and TAp73 (Figure 1j–m and
Extended Data 4d) and increased apoptosis (Extended Data Figure 4e–h) and senescence
(Extended Data Figure 4i–k). ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53−/− mice also had an
increased lifespan (Figure 1n). We found differences in CD4/CD8 positive cells in young
mice (4 weeks) (Extended Data Figure 4l–p) indicating that changes in T cell development
may lead to a lower tumour incidence in double mutant mice. Indeed, we found that p53−/−
thymic lymphomas are composed primarily of CD4/CD8 double positive thymocytes while
the ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53−/− lymphomas contain very few CD4/CD8
double positive thymocytes (Extended Data Figure 4q–t). Lastly, we asked whether thymic
stromal cells contribute to the apoptosis in the regressing lymphomas. We sorted CD45
positive cells to select for T-lymphocytes in p53−/−, ΔNp63fl/fl;p53−/− and ΔNp73fl/
fl;p53−/− mice and infected them with adenovirus-cre (Extended Data Figure 4u). ΔNp63Δ/
Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53−/− thymocytes underwent apoptosis independent of the
presence of the stromal cells (Extended Data Figure 4v). These data indicate that inhibition
of the ΔN isoforms of p63 and p73 serves to upregulate TAp63 and TAp73 to compensate
for loss of p53 in tumor suppression.
We found that the ΔN isoforms of p63 and p73 bind to the promoters of the TA isoforms of
p63 and p73 suggesting that the ΔN isoforms of p63 and p73 can transcriptionally repress
TAp63 and TAp73 transcription (Extended Data Figure 5a–i). We also found that the
increase in apoptosis and cellular senescence was dependent on TAp63 and TAp73
(Extended Data Figure 5j–q).

We performed RNA sequencing of lymphomas after infection with Ad-mCherry (ΔNp63fl/
fl;p53−/− and ΔNp73fl/fl;p53−/−) and Ad-Cre-mCherry (ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/
Δ;p53−/−) and found that thymic lymphomas from mice deficient for p53 and ΔNp63
clustered with those from mice deficient for p53 and ΔNp73 (Extended Data Figure 6a).
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Figure 1q) revealed genes involved in metabolism
including TP53-inducible glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR)18, and glutaminase 2
(GLS2)19,20. While we found that TIGAR and GLS2 were upregulated in either ΔNp63Δ/
Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53−/− thymic lymphomas, we identified a novel gene, islet
amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin, which limits glucose uptake resulting in increased
intra-cellular glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) 21 and decreased glycolysis 21, to be upregulated
by over 5 fold in both double mutant thymic lymphomas. We validated IAPP, TIGAR, and
GLS2 expression in thymic lymphomas derived from ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/
Δ;p53−/− mice and found that IAPP is expressed at levels over 2-fold higher in double
mutant mice (Figure 1p and Extended Data Figure 6b–d). IAPP and GLS2 depends on
TAp63 and TAp73 (Figure 1q and Extended Figure 6d). To determine whether TAp63 or
TAp73 transcriptionally regulate IAPP, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation in
MEFs (Extended Data Figure 6e–g) and thymocytes (Figure 1r & s). We found that TAp63
and TAp73 binds to sites located in the promoter (site 1), 1756 nucleotides upstream of the
transcriptional start site, and intron 2 (site 2) of IAPP, 706 nucleotides downstream of the
transcriptional start site (Extended Data Figure 6e–g). Because a greater binding affinity of
TAp63 and TAp73 was detected in the promoter region (site 1) of IAPP, we cloned this site
into a luciferase reporter gene and also mutated this site (Extended Data Figure 6h–k). Only

the luciferase reporter gene containing wild-type IAPP promoter site 1 was transactivated by
TAp63 and TAp73 while the mutant version was not. Taken together, these data indicate
that IAPP is a transcriptional target gene of TAp63 and TAp73 (Figure 1t).

Expression of IAPP in p53−/− MEFs resulted in low levels of glycolysis comparable to that
in ΔNp63−/−;p53−/− and ΔNp73−/−;p53−/− MEFs (Extended Data Figure 6l–m & Figure
1u). Conversely, when we knocked down IAPP in ΔNp63−/−;p53−/− and ΔNp73−/
−;p53−/− MEFs, the levels of glycolysis were similar to that of p53−/− MEFs (Figure 1u)
indicating that IAPP inhibits glycolysis. In vivo, we detected massive tumour regression in
ΔNp63fl/fl;p53−/− or ΔNp73fl/fl;p53−/− thymic lymphomas treated with IAPP (Extended
Data Figure 7a and Figure 2a, b, h, i, o & p), p<0.05. Conversely, in ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53−/− and
ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53−/− thymic lymphomas treated with Ad-shIAPP-mCherry the tumours
continued to grow comparable to that of p53−/− thymic lymphomas (Figure 2a–k & o–r),
p>0.05 at 13 weeks. Additionally, p53−/− mice treated with Ad-IAPP had an extended
tumour free survival compared to p53−/− mice or ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53−/
− mice treated intratumourally with Ad-shIAPP-mCherry (Extended Data Figure 7a & b)
indicating that IAPP is a tumour suppressor gene and is causally involved in the in vivo
effects seen upon inactivation of ΔNp63 or ΔNp73. Given that pramlintide, a synthetic
analog of amylin, is used to treat type I and type II diabetes 22, we treated thymic
lymphomas in ΔNp63fl/fl;p53−/− or ΔNp73fl/fl;p53−/− mice. Indeed, 3 weekly
intratumoral injections resulted in rapid tumour regression (Figure 2e, l, & s), p<0.005 at 13
weeks. This effect was exacerbated by systemic intravenous treatment with pramlintide
(Figure 2f, m, & t and Extended Data Figure 7c–q), p<0.005 similar to that seen in tumors
treated with a known inhibitor of glycolysis, 2DG, (Figure 2g, n, & u). These data provide
preclinical in vivo evidence that pramlintide can be used to effectively treat p53 deficient
tumours. Using in-vivo dynamic magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure the
conversion of hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate to lactate as a proxy of glycolysis within the
tumours, we found a marked reduction in glycolysis in ΔNp63/p53 and ΔNp73/p53 double
deficient mice and after introducing IAPP into p53−/− thymic lymphomas similar to tumors
treated with 2DG (Figure 2v). ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53−/− thymic
lymphomas infected with an shRNA for IAPP exhibited levels of glycolysis similar to those
found in p53−/− thymic lymphomas (Figure 2v). Pramlinitide also inhibits glycolysis in
tumours (Figure 2v).

IAPP has been shown to induce ROS and activate apoptosis 23,24. We found a drastic
increase in the levels of ROS and apoptosis in thymic lymphomas expressing IAPP,
pramlintide, or 2DG while both ROS and apoptosis did not occur upon inactivation of IAPP
in thymic lymphomas from ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53−/− mice (Figure 2w)
indicating that upregulation of IAPP inhibits glycolysis similar to 2DG and leads to
oxidative stress that triggers apoptosis. While high levels of ROS are not commonly
triggered by inhibition of glycolysis, nutrient deprivation or excess can result in the
accumulation of ROS. Additionally, cancer cells tightly regulate ROS by acquiring
additional mutations and compensatory mechanisms often ensue and may be at play in the
thymic lymphoma cells that acutely downregulate glycolysis by IAPP25.

To extend our findings to human cancer where p53 is altered in the majority of cases, we
analyzed human cancer cell lines containing p53 deletions or mutations. We used siRNA to
knockdown ΔNp63 or ΔNp73 in cells derived from a lung adenocarcinoma (H1299) (Figure
3a). Down regulation of ΔNp63 or ΔNp73 resulted in upregulation of TAp63, TAp73, and
IAPP (Figure 3a) and an increase in apoptosis and decrease in cell proliferation (Figure 3b
and Extended Figure 8a–d). To ask whether IAPP can also inhibit glycolysis in human
cancer cell lines, we transfected H1299 cells with siΔNp63, siΔNp73 or IAPP (Figure 3a).
Knock down of ΔNp63 or ΔNp73 or expression of IAPP resulted in an inhibition of
glycolysis (Figure 3c & d) and glucose uptake (Extended Data Figure 8e & g), accumulation
of ROS (Figure 3d–f), and induction of apoptosis (Figure 3d, g & h). We inhibited ROS in
these cells using N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and observed no apoptosis (Figure 3d–h).
Previous studies have indicated that IAPP inhibits glycolysis by increasing intracellular
glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in turn leading to an inhibition of hexokinase 21,26. We
measured the levels of intracellular G-6-P in H1299 cells and found that cells expressing
high levels of IAPP (H1299-siΔNp63, H1299-siΔNp73, or H1299+IAPP) also had high
levels of G-6-P while knock down of IAPP resulted in a diminution in G-6-P (Extended
Data Figure 8f & g). Over expression of glucose hexokinase II (HKII) led to a rescue of the
glycolytic capacity of H1299 cells expressing siΔNp63 or siΔNp73 similar to levels in
parental H1299 cells (Figure 3c–g). These results indicate that IAPP inhibits glycolysis
through the inhibition of HKII. We found that treatment of H1299 cells with pramlintide led
to similar effects on glycolysis and apoptosis (Figure 3g–n). Taken together, these data
demonstrate that IAPP and pramlintide inhibit glycolysis through the inhibition of HKII.

IAPP is a secreted protein and binds to the calcitonin receptor (CALCR) and receptor
activity modifying protein 3 (RAMP3)27. To determine whether IAPP functions through
these receptors to inhibit glycolysis, secreted media from H1299 cells expressing siΔNp63
(siΔNp63M) or siΔNp73 (siΔNp73M), which contains secreted IAPP (Figure 4a and
Extended Figure 9a & b), was added to H1299 cells resulting in inhibition of glycolysis
(Figure 4b) and induction of ROS and apoptosis (Figure 4c & d). In contrast, when these
media were used to treat H1299 cells with knock down of CALCR or RAMP3, glycolysis
was not inhibited and ROS and apoptosis were not induced (Figure 4b–d) indicating that the
CALCR and RAMP3 receptors are critical for IAPP function. We also treated the H1299
cells with media from H1299 cells expressing siΔNp63 (siΔNp63M) or siΔNp73 (siΔNp73M)
and an amylin inhibitor (A.I.), which led to high levels of glycolysis (Extended Data Figure
9c) and low levels of ROS and apoptosis (Figure 4c & d). IAPP causes activation of the
NLRP3 inflammasome 28, which has been shown to be anti-tumourigenic in certain cancers
via IL-18 processing29. We blocked caspase-1 using an inhibitor and found that it prevented
apoptosis of H1299 cells (Figure 4d), demonstrating that pyroptosis may also be an
important mechanism of action of IAPP.
To demonstrate the importance of the calcitonin receptor in vivo, we treated p53−/− mice
with thymic lymphomas at 10 weeks of age with pramlintide and a calcitonin receptor
inhibitor (Figure 4e–m) and found this inhibition rendered pramlintide ineffective indicating
the importance of the calcitonin receptor for IAPP/amylin/pramlintide function (Figure 4n).

deletions or mutations, we treated additional human cancer cell lines 30 with pramlintide and
a calcitonin receptor inhibitor resulting in increased glycolysis, decreased ROS and
apoptosis (Extended Data Figure 9d–i). We assessed patient survival using data from the
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of patients with p53 mutations and found that co-expression
of IAPP, CALCR and RAMP3 correlated with better patient survival in basal breast cancer
(Figure 4o), and colorectal cancer and lung squamous cell carcinoma (Extended Data Figure
9j & k).
Reactivation of p53 activity in tumours results in tumour suppression1,2. We have focused
on interactions between the three p53 family members and have revealed a novel strategy to
target p53-deficient and mutant cancers through amylin based therapies like pramlintide.

Generation of ΔNp73 Conditional Knockout Mice

Author Manuscript

The cre-loxP strategy was used to generate the ΔNp73 conditional knockout allele
(ΔNp73fl). Genomic p73 DNA from intron 3 to intron 3′ was amplified from BAC clone
DNA (BAC RP23-186N8, Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute). LoxP sites
flanking exon 3′ of p73 and neomycin (neo) gene flanked by frt sites inserted in intron 3′
were cloned into pL253 31. Mouse embryonic stem cells (G4) electroporated with the
targeting vector were analyzed by Southern blot analysis for proper targeting of the ΔNp73
allele. Resulting chimeras were mated with C57BL/6 albino females and genotyped as
described below. Mice with germ line transmission of the targeted allele (conditional, flox
neo allele, fn) were crossed to the FLPeR mice to delete the neo cassette. Resulting progeny
were intercrossed with Zp3-Cre (C57BL/6)32 transgenic mice. ΔNp73fl/+; Zp3-Cre females
were mated with C57BL/6 males to generate ΔNp73+/− mice. The ΔNp73+/− mice were
intercrossed to generate ΔNp73−/− mice. Compound mutant mice were generated by
intercrossing the ΔNp63+/− and ΔNp63fl/fl15 and the ΔNp73−/− and ΔNp73fl/fl mice with
the p53−/− mice 16. All procedures were approved by the IACUC at U.T. M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center.

previously described 9. Thymocytes from 6-week-old mice were collected 48 hours after
adenovirus infection. Cellular proteins were cross-linked to DNA using 1% formaldehyde
and chromatin was prepared as described previously 4,8,34. TAp63 and ΔNp63 ChIP analysis
was performed using a pan-p63 antibody (4A4, Santa Cruz) as described previously and the
TAp73 ChIP was performed using a TAp73 antibody (ab14430, Abcam) and ΔNp73 ChIP
was performed using a p73 antibody (IMG 259A, Imgenex). Putative TAp63 and TAp73
binding sites were scanned 3000bp upstream of the 5′UTR and in intron 2 of the IAPP gene.
qRT–PCR was performed by using primers specific for the indicated regions of IAPP:
Promoter-Site 1 (−1802) -forward 5′-AGAGTTCAAGGTCATCCTCGAC-3′ and (−1731) reverse 5′-TGTTCTGACATGCAGCCTCA-3′, Intron-2- Site 2 (+678)-forward 5′AGACAGGCATGCTTAGAGACG-3′ and (+765)– reverse 5′CACTCAGTGTGGATGTCCGT-3′, and non-specific site (+7532)- forward 5′GTGTGTGATGGTTTGGTGGAT-3′ and (+7623) - reverse 5′ACAAGGCAGTTGATGGAGACT-3′. Similarly, putative ΔNp63 and ΔNp73 binding sites
were scanned 10000 bp upstream of the 5′UTR and in intron 1 of TAp63 and TAp73. qRTPCR was performed by using the primers specific for the indicated regions on the TAp63
promoter: Site 1 (−41) –forward 5′-CAGGAGCTCTCAAATCAAGTCAGA-3′ and (+37) –
reverse 5′-ATCACAGAAGCCAGGACTTGTCAC-3′, and non-specific site (−3030) forward 5′-GCTATAAATGTTTCCATGTGATGGATTGC-3′ and (−2973) - reverse 5′-

Dual luciferase reporter assay

Author Manuscript

Luciferase assays were performed using p53−/−;p63−/− and p53−/−;p73−/− MEFs as
described previously35. To generate the luciferase reporter gene (pGL3-IAPP), the DNA
fragment containing the TAp63/TAp73-binding site identified by ChIP was amplified from
C57BL/6 genomic DNA by PCR with the following primers containing 5′ XhoI and 3′
HindIII cloning restriction enzyme sites: IAPP 5′ATACTCGAGGTGTTCAGGGAACCTTCGGT-3′ (forward) and 5′ATAAAGCTTCACCTGACCTCCAAACTCCC-3′ (reverse). Similarly, a mutant version of
the luciferase reporter gene (pGL3-IAPPMut) was generated using QuikChange Lightning
(Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The following primers 5′TATTGTTCTGACATCCAGCCTGATGTTGCCCAGTCTGGT-3′ (forward) and 5′ACCAGACTGGGCAACATCAGGCTGGATGTCAGAACAATA-3′(reverse) were used to
generate the mutant version.

RNA Sequencing and Analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Five μg of polyA+ RNA were used to construct RNA-Seq libraries using the standard
Illumina protocol. Mouse mRNA sequencing yielded 30–40 million read pairs for each
sample. The mouse mRNA-Seq reads were mapped using TopHat 36 onto the mouse
genome and build UCSC mm9 (NCBI 37) and the RefSeq mouse genes. Gene expression
and gene expression differences were computed using Cufflinks36. For each species, a
combined profile of all samples was computed; mRNA abundance was mean-centered and
Z-score transformed for each mRNA individually. Principal component analysis was
executed using the implementation within the R statistical analysis system. Hierarchical
clustering of samples was executed by first computing the symmetrical sample distance
matrix using the Pearson correlation between mRNA profiles as a metric, supervised sample
analysis was performed using the t-test statistics, and heatmaps were generated using the
heatmap.2 package in R. For gene signatures and pathway analysis gene list from the RNASeq comparing ΔNfl/fl;p53−/− versus ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53−/− were
obtained at a p-value <0.01. The RNA-Seq data has been deposited in the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) data repository and can be accessed using the following database accession
number: GSE60827. The genes upregulated in the ΔNp63Δ/Δ;p53−/− and ΔNp73Δ/Δ;p53−/
− and down regulated in the ΔNfl/fl;p53−/− were selected. The relative fold change of the
genes were calculated and sorted from highest to lowest. Genes with a greater than 1.5 foldincrease were selected and run through the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity
Systems) to screen for pathways and processes. Genes from the selected pathways were
cross-referenced with the Gene Set Enrichment (GSEA)(Broad Institute) data analysis,
DAVID Bioinformatics Resource 6.7 and GSEA implementation at the Molecular Signature
Database (MSigD) 37.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI imaging was performed at 10 weeks of age when the tumours were established and the
volumes range from 2.3 mm3 to 5 mm3. To reduce the variation between different groups of
mice, a cohort of n=5 with similar tumour volumes was established and tumors regression
was monitored by MRI. All mice were scanned once a week for a period of 35 weeks on a 7Tesla, 30-cm bore BioSpec MRI system (Bruker Biospin Corp., Billerica, MA).
Hyperpolarized Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

Author Manuscript

Dynamic MR spectroscopy (MRS) of hyperpolarized (HP) [1-13C] pyruvate was performed
in vivo in tumour bearing mice. To achieve polarization, a 26-mg sample of pyruvic acid
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with 15 mM of OX063 radical (GE Healthcare, Waukesha,
WI) and 1.5-mM Prohance (Bracco Diagnostics Inc., Monroe Township, NJ) was polarized
in a HyperSense DNP system (Oxford Instruments, Abington, Oxfordshire, UK) as
previously described 38,39. The frozen sample was dissolved in a 4-mL buffer containing 40mM TRIS, 80-mM NaOH, and 50-mM NaCl, resulting in a final isotonic and neutral
solution containing 80-mM [1-13C] pyruvate. A dual-tuned 1H/13C linear RF volume coil
with 72mm ID was used in conjunction with imaging gradients with 12cm ID. For anatomic
imaging, the 1H channel was used in transmit/receive mode. In addition to localizing scans,
flow-weighted oblique gradient echo images (TE = 1.4ms; TR = 55ms; 90° excitation; 3cm

× 3cm FOV encoded over a 64 × 64 image matrix) were acquired to confirm that the slice
prescription for 13C measurements would not be obfuscated by signals originating from
within the heart. For carbon spectroscopy, the RF volume coil was used in transmit-only
mode in conjunction with a custom-built 15-mm ID 13C surface coil for signal reception.
After dissolution, 200 μL of the HP [1-13C] pyruvate solution was administered to the
animals via tail-vein catheter. A slice-selective pulse-acquire sequence (TR = 1,500 ms; 15°
flip angle; 5 KHz spectral bandwidth; 2048 spectral points; 8-mm oblique slab; 120
repetitions) was used for dynamic spectroscopy beginning approximately 15s prior to
injection. Data were processed to generate spectral time-courses of the HP-pyruvate and its
lactate product. Spectra were phase adjusted and the area under the spectral peaks associated
with [1-13C] pyruvate and [1-13C] lactate were integrated over time to reflect the overall
signal observed from each metabolite over the course of the measurement. Total lactate
signal, which could only arise from interaction of HP pyruvate with relevant metabolic
enzymes, was normalized to the total signal from pyruvate.
Glycolysis Stress Assay
Extra-cellular acidification rate (ECAR) was measured using the extracellular flux analyzer
(SeaHorse Bioscience XF96) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours
after transfection, the cells were plated at a density of 1.5×104 cells per well in the XF 96well cell culture plates. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the culture medium was replaced
with 180 μl of running medium and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in a non-CO2 incubator.
Before calibration, 20 μl of 50 mM glucose, 11 μM oligomycin and 650 mM 2-DG were
aliquoted into each port in the sensor cartridge. ECAR was measured after the addition of
glucose and oligomycin and before the addition of 2-DG. Extra-cellular acidification rate
was normalized to mpH/min.

Glucose Uptake Measurement
Glucose uptake was calculated as a measure of glucose dependent proton secretion from the
maximum and basal glucose consumption after addition of 20 μl of 50 mM glucose and
measured using the extracellular flux analyzer (SeaHorse Biosciences XF96).
Glucose-6-phosphate Assay
Glucose-6-phosphate was measured using the Glucose-6-phosphate assay kit (ab83426,
Abcam) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
2×106 cells were collected, homogenized and passed through a 10 kD spin-column filter.
The eluate was collected and glucose-6-phosphate enzyme and substrate reaction was
performed for 30 min and absorbance was measured at 450nm.

In vitro Adeno-Cre Infection
ΔNp63fl/fl;p53−/− and ΔNp73fl/flp53−/− MEFs were plated at a density of 2.5×105 cells in
10 cm dishes before infection. Twelve hours later, MEFs were infected with Adeno-CMVmCherry or Adeno-CMV-Cre-mCherry (Gene Transfer Vector Core Facility, University of
Iowa). The cells were infected at an MOI of 6000 particles/cell. The efficiency of infection
was quantified by assessing mCherry positive cells.
In vivo Adeno-virus Infection and IVIS Lumina Imaging

Author Manuscript

All mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and 2% oxygen and placed on a custom bed. An
incision was performed to expose the sternum. Using a 28.5G U100 Insulin syringe, AdenomCherry/Adeno-Cre-mCherry (Gene Transfer Vector Core Facility, University of Iowa),
Adeno-IAPP-mCherry(Vector Labs) or Adeno-shIAPP-U6-mCherry (TRCN0000416196,

TTTG) was surgically administered by intra-thymic injection (5×1012 viral particles/gram of
body weight) through the 2nd and 3rd sternum. The incision was sealed using wound clips
and mice were allowed to recover. To determine the efficiency of the in vivo viral delivery
to the thymic lymphoma, IVIS Lumina Imaging (Perkin Elmer) was performed 48 hours
later. Images were captured using a Mid-600 series bandwidth filter and analyzed using the
Living Image® data analysis software.

In vitro and in vivo administration of pramlintide acetate

Author Manuscript

2×105 cells were plated in duplicate in a 6-well dish. Twelve hours later, cells were treated
with 10 μg/ml pramlintide acetate (AMYLIN Pharmaceuticals) or placebo for a period of 48
hours. pramlintide acetate (AMYLIN Pharmaceuticals) or placebo (sodium acetate/acetic
acid) was surgically administered through non-invasive intra-thymic injection using a
multiple dose protocol of pramlintide acetate (30 μg/gram of tumour weight). One injection
per week for three weeks was administered directly into the thymic lymphoma of the animal.
Another cohort of mice was treated bi-weekly for 3 weeks by intra-venous (I.V.) tail-vein
injection of pramlintide acetate (45 μg/kg body weight) or placebo. The investigator was
blinded to the treatment administered to each mouse. Tumour volumes were monitored
weekly by MRI. Health and blood glucose levels of the treated animals were monitored
weekly.

2×105 cells were plated in duplicate in a 6-well dish. Twelve hours later, cells were treated
with Calcitonin receptor antagonist (1 nM)(AC187, Tocris Bioscience) for a period of 48
hours with or without simultaneous pramlintide treatment. Similarly, a chronic dose of
Calcitonin receptor antagonist (1 nM/gram of tumour weight) was administered through
non-invasive intra-thymic injections with one injection every week for a period of three
weeks with or without simultaneous pramlintide treatment. Tumour volume was monitored
and measured weekly by MRI.
Survival Analysis
Survival analysis was conducted for the IAPP, RAMP3 and CalCR gene in the following
datasets: the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the TCGA Cancer cohort. We
considered four major cancer types with high p53 mutation rates, which include lung
squamous cell carcinoma41, head & neck squamous cell cancer42,43, basal breast cancer44,45,
and colon cancer46. The co-expression of the three genes was analyzed in cases only with

p53-mutation. In all cases, we considered gene expression changes above or below 2
standard deviations with respect to the normal controls. The log-rank test and Cox P test was
used to assess significance between the samples with or without expression changes of the
IAPP, RAMP3 and CalCR gene using the cBioPortal for cancer genomics47.
Statistics
Sample size for mouse cohorts in each experiment was chosen based on the penetrance of
the thymic lymphoma phenotype of the p53−/− mouse model (80%). Twenty to thirty mice
were used for survival analyses. Data were analysed using a one-way ANOVA test or a
Student’s t-test (two-sided) was used for comparison between two groups of data. A p-value
of 0.05 was considered significant. Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m.
