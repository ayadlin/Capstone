ABSTRACT
Genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer, is commonly caused by failures in
the DNA damage response. Here we conducted a bioinformatical screen to reveal
DNA damage response genes that are upregulated by estrogen and highly mutated
in breast and ovarian cancers. This screen identified 53 estrogen-dependent cancer
genes, some of which are novel. Notably, the screen retrieved 9 DNA helicases as
well as 5 nucleases. DNA2, which functions as both a helicase and a nuclease and
plays a role in DNA repair and replication, was retrieved in the screen. Mutations
in DNA2, found in estrogen-dependent cancers, are clustered in the helicase and
nuclease domains, suggesting activity impairment. Indeed, we show that mutations
found in ovarian cancers impair DNA2 activity. Depletion of DNA2 in cells reduces
their tumorogenicity in mice. In human, high expression of DNA2 correlates with poor
survival of estrogen receptor-positive patients but not of estrogen receptor-negative
patients. We also demonstrate that depletion of DNA2 in cells reduces proliferation,
while addition of estrogen restores proliferation. These findings suggest that cells
responding to estrogen will proliferate despite impaired in DNA2 activity, potentially
promoting genomic instability and triggering cancer development.

cells, enabling these cells to deal with replicative lesions that
arise in highly proliferative states and with DNA damage
caused by radiation or chemotherapy, which frequently
relies on administration of DNA-damaging agents. On the
other hand, loss of helicase functions promotes genomic
instability and can result in carcinogenesis [3].
Numerous nucleases play a role in DNA doublestrand break (DSB) repair as they are required for DNA
end resection, which is an essential step in DSB repair by
homologous recombination (HR). DSBs are considered the
most hazardous type of DNA damage, since impairment
in the response to these lesions may result in genomic
instability which is a hallmark of cancer cells [5–8].

INTRODUCTION
A prominent factor in tumorigenesis is genomic
instability, which involves changes in nucleic acid
sequences, structural chromosomal rearrangements, and
whole chromosome copy-number alterations. Failures in
DNA replication and in DNA damage response (DDR) are
common causes of genomic instability [1,2].
Helicases are motor proteins that unwind structured
nucleic acid. They are important for maintenance of
genomic stability and implicated in DNA repair, replication,
recombination transcription and chromosome segregation
[3,4]. Many DNA helicases are overexpressed in cancer

Estrogen-dependent cancers (breast, uterine,
and ovarian cancers) are leading causes of mortality in
women [9]. Estrogens, which are the primary female
sex hormones, are tumorigenic since they stimulate cell
proliferation and induce DNA damage. They stimulate
proliferation by binding to the estrogen receptors
(ERs), which are transcription factors that modulate
the expression of various genes involved in different
processes, including cell proliferation [10]. In addition,
estrogens are genotoxic agents since they are converted to
metabolites that can react with DNA to form depurinating
adducts, which are released from DNA to generate
apurinic sites [11]. Also, transcription regulation by
estrogens, which occurs via binding to the ERs, has been
suggested to induce DSB formation at the sites of estrogen
inducible genes [12].
Here we conducted a computational screen to reveal
novel genes involved in estrogen-dependent cancers.
We aimed for genes that are upregulated by estrogen,
play a role in the DDR and are highly mutated in breast
and ovarian cancers. This screen identified 53 estrogendependent cancer genes, some of which are novel.
Notably, the screen retrieved 9 DNA helicases as well as
5 nucleases. We focused on the involvement of the helicase
and nuclease DNA2 in estrogen-dependent tumorigenesis.
We discovered that mutations in DNA2, found in estrogendependent cancers, are clustered in its helicase and
nuclease domains and impair DNA2 activity. Depletion
of DNA2 in cells reduces the tumorogenity of these cells
in mice. In human, high expression of DNA2 correlates
with poor prognosis of ER-positive breast cancer patients.
Moreover, cells depleted of DNA2 cease to proliferate,
while addition of estrogen restores proliferation.

were considered valid. Two studies, which analyzed
treatments with E2 for 3, 6, or 24h, had these criteria
[16,17]. We calculated, for each gene present in these
studies, the ratio of expression between cells treated with
E2 and mock-treated control cells. We determined that a
gene is upregulated by estrogen if this ratio of expression
was above 2 in at least one experiment. This step retrieved
1280 genes (Supplementary Table S1).
DDR genes responding to estrogen are good
candidates for involvement in estrogen-dependent
cancers since the genes engaged in familial breast and
ovarian cancers participate in different aspects of the
DDR [18,19]. Hence, we filtered the genes upregulated
by estrogen to genes that cluster as DNA repair using
the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool (http://
david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov; GO_TERM_BP_5; Figure 1A).
This narrowed the number of genes of interest to 69
(Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
Somatic mutations found in cancer can be “driver”
mutations that trigger tumorigenesis, or “passenger”
mutations that are retained by chance during repeated
rounds of cell division and clonal expansion and do not
provide an advantage to the tumor [20,21]. The probability
for receiving the number of mutations found in tumors in
a particular candidate gene was tested (Figure 1A), taken
into account the size of the gene and the tissue specify. We
analyzed the dbGaP breast and ovarian cancer databases
(database of Genotypes and Phenotypes; http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap), based on the estimation that in
a tumor the rate of non-silent spontaneous mutations
in coding regions is 0.33 per Mb in breast cancers and
0.44 per Mb in ovarian cancers (average of 0.33 and 0.55
per Mb in breast and colorectal cancers, respectively;
[20,22]). 53 E2-upregulated DDR genes were significantly
mutated in either breast or ovarian cancers (p-value<0.05;
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The mutation
enrichment was observed in 45 and 26 E2-upregulated
DDR genes in breast and ovarian cancers, respectively
(Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Previously reported
estrogen-dependent cancer genes including classical
breast and ovarian cancer genes (e.g. BRCA1, BRCA2
and CHK2) as well as novel genes were scored in the
screen (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
Remarkably, the screen scored for a high proportion
of genes encoding helicases and nucleases (helicases17%: ATRX, BLM, BRIP1, DNA2, MCM7, RAD54B,
RAD54L, RECQL1, and SHPRH; nucleases- 7.55%:
DNA2, EXO1, FEN1, GEN1, and MRE11A; Table  1
and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). 7 of the retrieved
helicases and nucleases were not previously reported to
contain mutations or polymorphisms in association with
breast or ovarian cancers (Table 1, genes marked with an
asterisk). Next we tested if these 7 helicases and nucleases
are upregulated by estrogen, as implied from the gene
expression profiles from the bioinformatic screen. MCF7
cells were incubated with E2 for 24h and changes in

RESULTS
A bioinformatic screen for novel estrogendependent cancer genes
Estrogen-regulated genes are often central in the
proliferation and function of estrogen-dependent cancer
cells [13]. Additionally, impairment in the DDR may result
in genomic instability [14]. In light of this, we screened
for DDR genes that are regulated by estrogen and highly
mutated in estrogen-dependent cancers. The initial step
in the bioinformatic screen was to analyze for changes in
gene expression profiles due to treatment with estrogen.
The data was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) and included
studies that determined the expression profiles of MCF7
cells, which are ER-positive breast cancer cells, that were
mock-treated or treated with estradiol (E2; the primary
type of estrogen). Studies in which estrogen addition
resulted in upregulation of at least 5 out of 6 genes from
a well characterized signature for E2-upregulated genes
(GREB1, MYB, MYBL1, MYBL2, MYC and PGR [15])

screen architecture. The screen scored for genes that are upregulated by estrogen, part of the DNA damage response and highly mutated
in estrogen-dependent cancers. (B) MCF7 cells were treated with E2 (25nM) or mock treated for 24h. Expression levels of indicated
genes were detected by real-time PCR. Gene expression levels were normalized to GAPDH. Black bars represent control genes. Gray bars
represent genes of interest.

mRNA levels compared to control were analyzed by realtime PCR. As a control for induction of E2, expression of
BLM and BRCA1, which are known to be upregulated by
estrogen [23,24], was tested. We validated that 5 out of the
7 novel estrogen-dependent cancer genes are upregulated
by estrogen in MCF7 cells (Figure 1B).
DNA2 was retrieved in the screen (Table 1). Since
DNA2 functions as both a helicase and a nuclease we
continued studying its involvement in estrogen-dependent
cancers. DNA2 is involved in maturation of Okazaki
fragments during DNA replication, in preventing stalled
replication forks from reversing, and in DNA repair
[25–29]. DNA2 may therefore be implicated in cancer
development in a multifaceted manner. Mutations
in DNA2 can act as driver mutations that promote
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumorigenesis through induction of DNA damage. On the
other hand, high expression of DNA2 may increase its
helicase activity and thus facilitate coping with replicative
lesions arising in highly proliferative states and with DNA
damage caused by radiation or chemotherapy [3].

Mutations in the DNA2 gene, found in estrogendependent cancer cases, are clustered in the
helicase and nuclease domains
The distribution of mutations in a particular gene
in cancer cases may imply if these mutations affect
gene function and by that trigger cancer formation. We
analyzed the cosmic database (http://cancer.sanger.
ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/) for mutations

at residues conserved even in the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (Supplementary Table S4). In order to gain
insight into how these mutations contribute to cancer
development, we developed a system in yeast to determine
whether these mutations abrogate DNA2 activity. Yeast
DNA2 (scDNA2) is well characterized and depletion of
scDNA2 is lethal. It was demonstrated that the helicases
human DNA2 and human BLM can suppress the growth
defects of the temperature sensitive dna2-1 strain, which
is mutated in scDNA2. Moreover, a mutated form of
human BLM, which contains a mutation (K695T) that
inactivates its helicase activity, failed to complement the
growth defects of the dna2-1 strain [32]. This implies that
an active helicase is required in order to overcome the
growth defects resulting from the impairment of scDNA2.
An addition benefit of the yeast system is that it enables to
express different forms of human DNA2 (WT and mutants)
at relatively equal levels. The TET-off system was used

in the DNA2 gene in estrogen-dependent cancer cases.
Remarkably, most of the somatic mutations were found
to be clustered in the helicase or nuclease domains of
DNA2 (Figure 2A). This suggests that the cancer-related
mutations in DNA2 lead to inactivation or impairment
of DNA2 activity, which is known to be essential for the
maintenance of genomic stability [30,31].

Somatic mutations in DNA2 occurring in
ovarian cancers impair the activity of DNA2
Searching the dbGaP database we found four
missense mutations in the DNA2 gene in ovarian cancer
cases. Two mutations are located at the nuclease domain
and two at the helicase domain (Figure 2A, magenta and
Supplementary Table S4). The mutations in the nuclease
domain occurred at less conserved residues compared
to the mutations in the helicase domain, which occurred

to deplete scDNA2 expression. We introduced human
DNA2 to the TET-off scDNA2 strain (Hughes collection
[33]) and incubated the yeast cells in the presence of
Doxycycline (Dox) to inhibit scDNA2 synthesis. Human
DNA2 partially complemented the lethal phenotype
associated with the depletion of scDNA2 (Figure 2B).
Next, we tested the ability of human DNA2, harboring
the mutations found in ovarian cancer cases (Figure 2A,
magenta and Supplementary Table S4), to complement the
TET-off scDNA2 strain growth defect. Since changes in
the expression levels of DNA2 may affect the yeast growth
phenotype, we verified by Western-blot analysis that the
expression levels of the different forms of human DNA2
(WT or mutated forms) are comparable (Figure 2C). The
growth defect induced by scDNA2 depletion by DOX
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was not complemented by two mutated forms of human
DNA2 (Q185E and Q203E; Figure 2D) and was partially
complemented by the G991S mutant. The E807V mutant
complemented the growth of the scDNA2 strain similarly
to WT human DNA2 (Figure 2D).
DNA2 plays a role in DNA repair and replication
[25–29], hence the effect of the mutated variants of human
DNA2 was analyzed under DNA damage and replication
stresses. The TET-off scDNA2 strains expressing WT or
mutated forms of human DNA2 were subjected to UV
radiation or incubated on plates with hydroxyurea (HU) or
MMS. Replication stress, induced by HU, highly impaired
cell growth even in the presence of scDNA2 (Figure 2E;
compare -Dox and -Dox +HU plates). The expression
of different forms of DNA2 between cells growing with

and without HU had a similar effect on the growing of
yeast depleted for scDNA2 (compare Figure 2E +Dox
to +Dox+HU). Notably, testing the ability of the human
DNA2 mutants to complement the scDNA2 phenotype
upon DNA damage induction, due to UV radiation or MMS
supplementation, demonstrated that the G991S mutant
also impairs DNA2 activity, as was already indicated
without DNA damage induction for the Q185E and
Q203E mutants (Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure S1).
The discovery that mutations, which occurred in cancer
cases did not complement the yeast phenotype at all, or
partially complemented the phenotype compared to the WT
human DNA2, demonstrates that these mutations impair
DNA2 activity (either full or partial impairment) [32].

Since misregulation of helicase expression is a
common feature of carcinogenesis [3] we examined, in
silico, the expression levels of DNA2 in different types
of estrogen-dependent cancers, using the cBioPortal for
Cancer Genomics [35]. We matched DNA2 expression
levels to copy-number alterations (CNA) in the DNA2
locus and found variation in the expression levels of
different tumors, including those having a similar CNA
pattern (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S3A).
Higher expression of DNA2 is correlated with gain
or amplification of the DNA2 locus (Figure 4A and
Supplementary Figure S3A). The variation in the
expression levels of DNA2 between cancer cells that
have a similar DNA2 CNA pattern could be due to
differences in the methylation levels of the DNA2 locus.
We did not find a correlation between the expression
levels and methylation levels of DNA2 (Figures 4B and
Supplementary Figure S3B). These results highlight that
changes in DNA2 expression are a common feature of
tumors and that CNA can partially explain this variation.

Depletion of DNA2 in human MDA-MB-435/
GFP cells inhibits xenograft growth in mice
Downregulation of DNA2 in MCF7 and U20S
cell lines results in reduced cell proliferation ([31,34]
and Supplementary Figure S2) and in U2OS cells it also
induces cellular senescence [34]. The effect of DNA2
downregulation on the aggressive MDA-MB-435 cell line
was tested. We infected MDA-MB-435 cells that stably
express GFP (MDA-MB-435/GFP) with two shRNAs
directed against DNA2 (shDNA2 and shDNA2′) and a
control shRNA (shSCR), and verified the depletion of
DNA2 by real-time PCR (Figure 3A). Next, we analyzed
the cell growth of these 3 cell populations. While MDAMB-435/GFP infected with shDNA2 grow slower than the
control cells, the growth of cells infected with shDNA2′
was relatively similar to the control (Figure 3B). Since
the growing rate of MDA-MB-435/GFP cells infected with
shDNA2′ was comparable to that of the control, this cell
line was used to analyze whether DNA2 supports tumor
growth. MDA-MB-435/GFP cells infected with shDNA2′,
or with the control shSCR, were injected bilaterally into
the #4 mammary glands of NOD/SCID female mice.
Tumor formation in mice was monitored for 12 weeks
and tumor volume was measured (Figure 3C). Reduced
tumor weight was obtained in tumors derived from cells
depleted of DNA2 as compared to the control (Figure 3D).
Next, the lungs from the sacrificed mice were dissected
and metastasis formation was evaluated by analyzing for
cells expressing GFP, which originated from the MDAMB-435/GFP cells. Lung metastasis formation was almost
prevented when DNA2-depleted cells were injected
(Figure 3E). These results indicate that DNA2 is required
for xenograft growth and suggest that its expression
in breast cancer can be tumor promoting. Inhibition
of metastasis formation may indicate impairment in
metastasis formation (e.g. migration, local invasion or
survival in the circulation) but may also be a result of
slower growth rate, resulting in lower detection capacity
of the metastasis.

High expression level of DNA2 correlates with
poor survival of ER-positive breast cancer
patients
Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, which are defined as
the probability of surviving for a given length of time,
show that in patients with breast cancer, DNA2 expression
is inversely correlated with the duration of overall patient
survival ([34] and Supplementary Figure S3C). We divided
the breast cancer patients according to the ER expression
status of their tumors and examined the KM curves
obtained for ER-positive and ER-negative subgroups.
Notably, the KM curves indicate that high DNA2
expression is significantly correlated with poor survival
of the ER-positive patients (Figure 4C). Notably, such
correlation was not detected for the ER-negative subgroup
(Figure 4C). This implies that DNA2 overexpression
significantly provides inferior survival only in cells
responding to estrogen and that there is interplay
between DNA2 and estrogen. Higher expression levels
of DNA2 in tumor cells may attenuate the replication
stress and DNA damage accumulation associated
with cancer.

Attenuation of cell growth due to depletion of
DNA2 is reduced by estrogen
The interplay between DNA2 and estrogen was
further studied by analyzing the effect of estrogen on the
proliferation of MCF7 cells downregulated for DNA2.
We infected MCF7 cells with two shRNAs against DNA2

confirmed downregulation of DNA2 using real-time PCR
(Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure S3D). We grew
the cells in media containing charcoal-stripped serum (no
estrogen) and supplemented with E2 (estrogen) or ethanol
(control). Cells downregulated for DNA2 that were grown
in the absence of estrogen grew poorly (Figure 4E and
Supplementary Figure S3E). Remarkably, addition of E2
to the media resulted in accelerated cell growth (Figure

an explanation for the survival of cells that contain
mutations in DNA2 in tissues that are located in the
estrogen niche.

DNA helicases affect carcinogenesis in a
multifaceted way (Figure 5). Impairment in the activity of
many DNA helicases correlates with genomic instability
and cancer predisposition [3], indicating that helicases
prevent chromosomal instability, mutation accumulation,
and maintain cellular homeostasis. Numerous genetic
diseases that predispose to cancer are linked to mutations
in genes encoding helicases. For example, BLM, WRN,
and RECQL4 are mutated in Bloom, Werner, and
Rothmund-Thomson genomic instability syndromes,
respectively, and XPB and XPD are mutated in Xeroderma
Pigmentosum, characterized by high risk of skin cancer
[36]. Moreover, hereditary mutations and polymorphisms
in helicases often predispose, in a heterozygous state,
to cancer (e.g. mutations in BLM [37]). On top of that,
helicases are frequently mutated in sporadic cancers
(Table 1). These suggest that loss of helicase activity
promotes genomic instability and triggers tumorigenesis.
In parallel, the expression of many DNA helicases is
upregulated in cancer cells, enabling the cells to cope
with replicative lesions that arise in highly proliferative
states and with DNA damage caused by radiation or
chemotherapy [3].

DISCUSSION
Here we conducted a computational screen to reveal
novel genes involved in estrogen-related cancers. First, we
searched for genes that are upregulated by estrogen and
play a role in the DDR. Involvement in the DDR was an
important parameter in our screen since the genes found
to be involved in familial breast and ovarian cancers
participate in different aspects of the DDR [18,19].
Moreover, components of the DDR are potential drug
targets for reduction of cancer cell viability and small
molecule inhibitors that target the activity of different
DDR members, such as PARP, DNA-PK, and ATM, are
currently under development [2]. The next step in the
screen was to score for genes that are highly mutated in
estrogen-related cancers out of the DDR genes that are
upregulated by estrogen. These criteria retrieved 53 DDR
genes that are upregulated by estrogen and highly mutated
in breast and ovarian cancers. These genes included
established breast and ovarian cancer genes as well as
genes that are potential estrogen-dependent cancer genes.
Notably, there was an enrichment for helicases (17%) and
nucleases (7.5%) among the retrieved genes. We focused
on DNA2 that encodes a protein with both helicase and
nuclease activities. Recently, Peng et al demonstrated that
DNA2 expression is significantly increased in cancers and
its expression correlates with patient outcome [34]. In our
study we elaborated on the role of DNA2 in estrogendependent cancers and showed that DNA2 expression
is not only increased but also reduced in cancer cells.
Moreover, we showed that mutations in DNA2 frequently
appear in tumors and that they are clustered in its helicase
and nuclease domains, suggesting that these mutations
impair the activity of DNA2. Indeed, we demonstrated
that mutations from ovarian cancer cases impair DNA2
activity. We also found that depletion of DNA2 in cells
reduces tumorigenicity of these cells in mice and that
in human, high expression of DNA2 correlates with
poorer survival of ER-positive patients. Moreover, our
data reveals that while cells depleted of DNA2 cease
proliferation, addition of estrogen restores proliferation.

Helicases and estrogen-dependent cancer
Our study reveals that estrogen upregulates the
expression of many DNA helicases, which we found to
be highly mutated in breast and ovarian cancers (Table 1).
Estrogen also drives cells into a proliferating state [10].
Since helicases facilitate the ability of cells to cope with
replicative lesions, upregulation of helicases may allow
maintenance of genomic stability in estrogen-responding
tissues [3]. Therefore, mutations that impair helicase
activity may specifically trigger genomic instability in
estrogen-responding tissues. Mutations in BLM that result
in breast cancer were shown to be in a heterozygous state
since the wild-type allele was active in the tumors [38].
Notably, when we examined the state of the helicases
found in the screen, in the cosmic database, we found
them to be heterozygous in all cases (data not shown).
This suggests that for cell survival at least one wild-type
allele of the helicase is essential. Based on our results
and others we hypothesize that cells, which response to
estrogen and harbor a heterozygous mutation in a helicase,
may have a better chance for survival due to the estrogen
signal because: 1). Estrogen upregulates the expression of
the impaired and wild type alleles, which may reduce the
mutation effect. 2). Estrogen upregulates the expression
of many other helicases, compensating the impairment in
the activity of the helicase. 3). Estrogen strongly promotes
proliferation. Hence, cells with a mutation in a helicase
that respond to estrogen may proliferate. Since helicases
have key roles in DNA repair and replication, the mutated

helicases contribute to genomic instability and may trigger cancer development. High expression of helicases facilitates coping with
replicative lesions that arise in highly proliferative states and with DNA damage caused by radiation or chemotherapy.

helicase may trigger genomic instability in these cells.
Our results regarding the interplay between DNA2 and
estrogen validate this concept. Mutations in DNA2 found
in ovarian cancers impair DNA2 activity (Figure 2) and
depletion of DNA2 in estrogen-responding cells (MCF7)
ceases proliferation, unless the cells are supplemented with
estrogen (Figures 4E and Supplementary Figure S3E).
These results demonstrate that cells having a mutation in
a helicase can survive if responding to estrogen.

Genes involved in DSB repair by HR are highly mutated
in breast and ovarian cancers [18,19]. Estrogen induces
proliferation [10] that may lead to replication stress,
which can result in DNA damage [40]. Thus, proper
DSB repair mechanisms are essential for maintenance
of genomic stability and impairment in HR genes will
promote cancer formation. Here we show that many
HR genes are upregulated by estrogen (Supplementary
Table S1). Moreover, it was suggested that ERα-mediated
transcription induces DSBs specifically at estrogeninducible genes [12]. Thus, accumulation of mutations
and small insertions may occur in HR genes, resulting in
inaccurate DSB repair.

DSB repair by HR and estrogen-dependent
cancer
During HR repair, the 5′ strand resection at DSBs
provides 3′ single-stranded DNA that is required for
strand invasion and repair. DNA end resection involves
the nuclease and helicase activities of the BLM–DNA2–
RPA–MRN and EXO1–BLM–RPA–MRN complexes
[39]. Notably, apart from RPA, all of these genes, as well
as numerous genes involved in HR, were scored in the
screen (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).

Nucleases and estrogen-dependent cancer
Nucleases are essential for genome stability. They
act as proof-readers of DNA polymerization during DNA
replication. They can remove unusual DNA structures and
are involved in DNA repair and in maturation of Okazaki
fragments. Incomplete or poorly processed Okazaki

fragments can lead to mutations and to the generation of
DSBs. The processing of RNA/DNA primers requires both
DNA2 and FEN1. DNA2 cleaves long DNA flaps that
escape FEN1 activity during Okazaki fragment maturation
[41]. Notably, both genes were scored in the screen for
DDR genes that are upregulated by estrogen and highly
mutated in breast and ovarian cancers (Table 1).

In order to test if there is a positive selection for
mutations in a gene in cancers, the dbGaP breast and
ovarian cancer databases (the database of Genotypes and
Phenotypes; http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/gap) were
analyzed for non-silent mutations. The proportion of
tumors mutated in a gene in each database was compare
to the expected proportion under the assumption for no
selection using one-tailed one-proportion z-test. Expected
proportion was calculated according to gene size using
the evaluation for non silent mutation rate in breast cancer
0.33 per Mb and in ovarian cancer 0.44 per Mb (average
of 0.33 and 0.55 per Mb in breast and colorectal cancers,
respectively)[20,22]. P-value <0.05 was considered
significant.

Future prospectives
Cancer cases consist of a large collection of distinct
genetic profiles and the therapeutic strategies designed
should consider these differences. Identification of tumor
biomarkers has a pivotal role in personalized medicine.
These biomarkers may be misregulated expression of
genes (overexpressed or repressed) or driver mutations
which promote tumorigenesis [42]. We suggest that
development of specific inhibitors for nucleases and
helicases may facilitate treatment of estrogen-dependent
tumors. Inhibition of nucleases and helicases that are
overexpressed in a tumor will decrease the growth
advantage provided by this overexpression. On the
other hand, in cases that the expression or the activity
of the nuclease or helicase is reduced, inhibition of
other helicases or nucleases may facilitate therapy by
simultaneous perturbing the two genes in order to obtain
synthetic lethality.

shRNA mediated knock-down and
real-time PCR
Cells were infected with lentiviruses containing
shRNA targeting two sequences of human DNA2
(shDNA2 and shDNA2′) or control (SCR) as described
in [31]. 48h flowing infection, cells were selected
with puromycin for additional 72h and then used for
the experiments. Knockdown efficiencies were tested
using real-time PCR with primers for DNA2 (F- 5′
gctgtcctgagtgaaacttttagg 3′ R- 5′ cctcatggagaaccgtacca3′).
GAPDH was used as an internal control for housekeeping
gene expression (F- 5′ tgagcttgacaaagtggtcg 3′ R- 5′
gctctccagaacatcatcc 3′).

METHODS
Microarray data processing and data selection

Cell growth experiments and E2 induction

To identify genes upregulated in the presence of
estrogen, expression arrays from the GEO, GDS3217,
GDS3283, GDS3285 and GDS3315, (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo) were analyzed for studies done in
MCF7 cell line treated with E2 or mock treated using
HG-U133plus2 microarray platforms (Affymetrix). Raw
data (CEL files) of all samples were examined with MAS5
probe set condensation algorithm with Expression Console
(Affymetrix). Ratio of expression of above 2, between
E2-treated and mock-treated cells, was considered as an
upregulation. A well characterized signature for estrogen
response is the upregulation of GREB1, MYB, MYBL1,
MYBL2, MYC and PGR [15]. Studies in which at least
5 out of 6 genes of this signature were upregulated in the
presence of E2, were considered valid (GDS3285-3h and
6h and GDS3315-24h) [16,17].
In order to filter for genes that have a role in the
DDR, the genes upregulated by estrogen were analyzed
using the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool
(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov; GO_TERM_BP_5;). Genes
that clustered as “DNA repair” were selected. David IDs
of genes which were not recognized by the GeneCards
human gene database (http://www.genecards.org/) were
removed.

MCF7 and MDA-MB-435 cells overexpressing GFP
(MDA-MB-435/GFP), were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2,
with DMEM growth media supplemented with fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Prior to testing the response of cells to E2,
MCF7 cells were transferred to phenol red free media
supplemented with charcoal striped FBS for 72 hours.
To study cellular proliferation, cells were seeded at
equal numbers and grown for the indicated time fraims.
Cells were fixated with 0.5% glutardialdehyde (SigmaAldrich), stained with methylen blue (Sigma-Aldrich),
dissolved in 0.1 M boric acid (pH 8.5). Color extraction
was performed using 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, and the
staining, which is proportional to cell number, was
quantified by measuring absorbance at 620 nm.

Tumor and metastasis assay
Experiments were approved by the Hebrew
University Animal Care and Use Committee. For tumor
xenografts, 106 MDA-MB-435/GFP cells infected
with control or shDNA2′ cells (described above) were
mixed with 5 µl matrix gel (25% of final volume, BD

Yeast assay
Human DNA2 was sub-cloned from pCDNA33*Flag-human DNA2 (a kind gift from Jeong-Hoon Kim)
to pRS415-GPD using Spe1 and Xho1 restriction enzymes.
Then mutagenesis on DNA2 was preformed to generate
Q185E, Q203E, E807V and G991S mutants, using site
directed mutagenesis. An empty plasmid or plasmids for
expressing human DNA2 WT or mutants were introduced
into a yeast strain from the Hughes collection [33] were
the endogenous promoter of scDNA2 was replaced with a
TET-off promoter (a his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0::
URA::CMV-tTA, Kan-tetO7-DNA2). Yeast cells were
grown over-night in a selection liquid media at 30°. Next,
the cells were diluted to a concentration equivalent to
1 OD (600 nm), and then diluted serially to 10−1, 10−2, 10−3
and 10−4 OD in liquid selection media. 5µl of diluted yeast
were seeded on selection plates with or without 20 µg/ml
Doxycycline (Dox). Plates were incubated for the
indicated hours. UV radiation was of 60 Joule/m2 and HU
final concentration in media was 100 mM).
For Western blot analysis, yeasts were harvested at
logarithmic stage at equal quantities. Proteins were blotted
using anti-human DNA2 antibody (Abcam) and anti-yeast
G6PD antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for loading control.
