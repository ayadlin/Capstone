Abstract
In most patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the disease can be kept under control using the
BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib. Nevertheless, resistance or intolerance to imatinib and other BCR/ABL
inhibitors may occur during therapy. Therefore, CML research is focusing on novel targets and targeted drugs.
Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an essential role in mitosis. In this study, we
examined the expression of Plk1 in CML cells and its potential role as a therapeutic target. Plk1 was found to
be expressed in phosphorylated form in the CML cell line K562 as well as in primary CML cells in all patients
tested. Inhibition of BCR/ABL by imatinib or nilotinib (AMN107) led to decreased expression of the Plk1 protein in CML cells, suggesting that BCR/ABL promotes Plk1 generation. Silencing of Plk1 in CML cells by a
small interfering RNA approach was followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, the Plk1-targeting
drug BI 2536 was found to inhibit proliferation of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells, including
leukemic cells, carrying the T315 mutation of BCR/ABL with reasonable IC50 values (1–50 nmol/L). The growthinhibitory effects of BI 2536 on CML cells were found to be associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
Moreover, BI 2536 was found to synergize with imatinib and nilotinib in producing growth inhibition in
CML cells. In conclusion, Plk1 is expressed in CML cells and may represent a novel, interesting target in
imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1513–23. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a stem cell disease defined by the chromosomal translocation t(9;22) (1–3). The related oncogene, BCR/ABL, encodes a 210-kDa oncoprotein,
BCR/ABL, which exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase activity
(1–3). Various downstream signaling pathways, survival molecules, and cell cycle regulators contribute to BCR/ABLinduced transformation (1–3). These pathways and growth
regulators are considered to act together to trigger proliferation and survival in leukemic cells in CML (1–3).

The BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib is regarded as
standard first-line treatment in CML (4–8). Most patients
in chronic phase CML can be driven into complete cytogenetic remission with imatinib (4–7). Nevertheless, resistance
against imatinib can occur, especially in accelerated phase
and blast phase (9–12). In these patients, BCR/ABL point mutations are often detectable (9–12). In other patients, BCR/
ABL amplification or additional pro-oncogenic hits are found
(9–12). Imatinib-resistant patients often respond to a secondgeneration BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as
nilotinib (AMN107) or dasatinib (13–17). Some of these patients may enter long-lasting complete cytogenetic remission
(13–17). However, in many cases, resistance to second-generation
TKI develops (15–17). A special problem is the T315I mutation,
which confers resistance against most BCR/ABL TKIs (16–19).
In other patients, BCR/ABL-independent molecules triggering
survival or cell cycle progression may be activated and contribute to resistance. Therefore, new compounds and strategies have been considered to overcome drug resistance in
CML (20, 21). One attractive approach may be to combine
BCR/ABL TKI with other targeted drugs to achieve synergistic
effects (20, 21).
Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a serine/threonine kinase that
plays an essential role in mitosis and cell cycle progression
in normal and neoplastic cells (22–24). Plk1 has recently
been introduced as a potential therapeutic target in oncology

The aims of the present study were to determine whether
Plk1 is expressed in activated form in imatinib-naive and
imatinib-resistant CML cells and whether Plk1 would represent a potential therapeutic target in CML.

Materials and Methods
Patients and isolation of primary CML cells. Primary
CML cells were obtained from the peripheral blood (PB) of
25 patients with CML. The patients' characteristics are
shown in Table 1. For control experiments, bone marrow
(BM) cells from 17 lymphoma patients without BM involvement, 1 with cutaneous mastocytosis, 2 with AML in complete remission, and 3 without hematologic disease were
used. All samples were collected during routine investigations. The study was approved by the ethics committee
(Medical University of Vienna). All patients gave written informed consent before BM or PB was obtained.
Reagents. The Plk1 inhibitor BI 2536 was kindly provided
by Dr. Dorothea Rudolph (Boehringer Ingelheim, Vienna,
Austria). Imatinib and nilotinib (AMN107) were kindly provided by Drs. Paul Manley and Elisabeth Buchdunger (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland). Stock solutions of drugs
were prepared by dissolving in DMSO (Merck). The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, mitogenactivated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase
(MEK) inhibitor PD98059, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)
inhibitor SP600125, p38 inhibitor SB203580, and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin were from
Calbiochem; bortezomib was from Janssen-Cilag; RPMI 1640,
FCS, and antibiotics were from PAA Laboratories; [3H]thymidine
was from Amersham; and propidium iodide was from Sigma.
Cells and culture conditions. The Philadelphia chromosome–positive CML cell line K562 was maintained in RPMI
1640 and 10% FCS. Imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant
K562 cells (37) were used. Imatinib-resistant K562 cells were
maintained in imatinib (1 μmol/L). We also examined parental Ba/F3 cells and Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type BCR/ABL
(Ba/F3p210WT) or various BCR/ABL mutants: Ba/F3p210T315I,
Ba/F3p210E255K, Ba/F3p210M351T, Ba/F3p210Y253F, and Ba/
F3p210H396P, kindly provided by Dr. Michael Deininger (Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute, Portland,
OR; ref. 38). Primary CML cells were isolated from PB and
layered over Ficoll to isolate mononuclear cells. All cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and antibiotics.
In a separate set of experiments, Ba/F3 clones were cultured
in the presence or absence of interleukin-3 (1 ng/mL).
Detection of Plk1 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR
and quantitative PCR. For reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR) analysis and real-time PCR, RNA was isolated using
the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random
primers (both from Invitrogen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used to amplify human Plk1
were: 5′-CCCATCTTCTGGGTCAGCAAG-3′ (forward) and
5′-AAGAGCACCCCCACGCTGTT-3′ (reverse). PCR conditions
were as follows: annealing, 30 s (65°C); extension, 1 min (72°C);
denaturation, 30 s (94°C); 30 cycles. Equal loading was con-

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

firmed by determining β-actin mRNA levels using published
primers (39, 40). Real-time PCR was performed on a 7900HT
Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using iTaq
SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad). Plk1 mRNA levels
were normalized against β-actin mRNA levels. Results were
expressed as ΔCT values (ΔCT = CTPlk1 − CTβ-actin).
Detection of phosphorylated and total Plk1 by immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry was performed on cytospin preparations of primary CML cells, normal BM cells,
and K562 cells as described (40). For detection of total Plk1, a
polyclonal rabbit anti-Plk1 antibody (work dilution, 1:250;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a second-step biotinylated
goat anti-rabbit IgG (Biocare) were used. For detection of
phosphorylated Plk1 (p-Plk1), a monoclonal mouse
anti–p-Plk1 antibody (1:50; BD Pharmingen) and a biotinylated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Biocare) were applied. Streptavidin-alkaline-phosphatase complex (Biocare) served as
chromogen. Antibody reactivity was made visible by
neofuchsin.
Detection of Plk1 by immunoprecipitation and Western
blotting. K562 cells were preincubated in control medium or
in the presence of BI 2536 (1 μmol/L), imatinib (1 μmol/L),
nilotinib (1 μmol/L), LY294002 (20 μmol/L), PD98059 (50
μmol/L), SB203580 (10 μmol/L), SP600125 (10 μmol/L), or rapamycin (1 μmol/L) for up to 24 h. In time course experiments, cells were incubated with BI 2536 for 1, 5, 15, and
240 min. Thereafter, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described (41) using anti-Plk1 antibody (1:1,000). For immunoprecipitation, lysates from 107
cells were incubated with 5 μL of anti-Plk1 antibody and protein G–Sepharose beads (Amersham). Phosphorylated BCR/
ABL (p-BCR/ABL) was detected at 150 to 250 kDa using
anti-phosphoprotein antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology).
Silencing of Plk1 with small interfering RNA. Plk1 small
interfering RNA (siRNA; sequence: 5′-GAUCACCCUCCUUAAAUAUdTdT-3′; ref. 29) and control siRNA against luciferase (5′-CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGAdTdT-3′) were
synthesized by Dharmacon Research. The siRNAs (200
nmol/L) were transfected into K562 cells using Lipofectin
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Twenty-four and 48 h after transfection, cells were spun on
cytospin slides, and the numbers of mitotic and apoptotic
cells were determined by light microscopy. In addition, cells
were subjected to cell cycle analysis and combined Annexin
V/propidium iodide staining. Plk1 knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting.
Analysis of cell cycle progression, mitosis, and apoptosis. K562 cells were incubated in control medium or medium
containing 100 nmol/L BI 2536 for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were
resuspended in 500 μL of permeabilization buffer (0.1% sodium acetate and 0.1% Triton X-100). Then, 40 μL of propidium
iodide (40 μg/mL) were added. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson).
The effects of BI 2536 on cell survival were analyzed by morphology, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and flow cytometry.
In typical experiments, K562 cells were incubated with various concentrations of BI 2536 (1–100 nmol/L) or control

BI 2536 Inhibits Growth of CML Cells

Figure 1. Plk1 is expressed in CML cells in a BCR/ABL-dependent manner. A, RT-PCR was performed using cDNA from normal BM (Co BM; n = 3), PB from
16 CML patients, and primers specific for Plk1 and β-actin. B, immunocytochemistry was performed in K562 cells, primary CML cells, and normal BM
cells using antibodies against Plk1 (top) or p-Plk1 (bottom). Patients' numbers (#) refer to Table 1. C, Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were
performed with imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant (res.) K562 cells kept in the presence or absence of imatinib or nilotinib (each 1 μmol/L) for
24 h using anti-phosphoprotein antibody 4G10 for detection of p-BCR/ABL and antibodies against Plk1 or β-actin. D, K562 cells were incubated in control
medium or in LY294002 (20 μmol/L), PD98059 (50 μmol/L), rapamycin (1 μmol/L), SB203580 (10 μmol/L), SP600125 (10 μmol/L), or nilotinib (1 μmol/L)
for 24 h before immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed.

medium for 12, 24, 48, or 96 h. The percentage of mitotic and
apoptotic cells was quantified by Wright-Giemsa staining. TUNEL assay was performed by In Situ Cell Death Detection kit,
Fluorescein (Roche Diagnostics) as described (39, 40). Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis was performed using Annexin
V-FITC (Alexis Biochemicals; refs. 39, 40). Staining reactions
were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan.
Measurement of cell proliferation. Cell lines and primary
CML cells were incubated with various concentrations of BI
2536 (100 pmol/L to 1 μmol/L). Then, [3H]thymidine uptake
was evaluated as described (39, 40). To determine potential
additive or synergistic drug effects, BCR/ABL+ cells were exposed to various combinations of BI 2536 and imatinib or BI
2536 and nilotinib at a fixed ratio of drug concentrations. All
experiments were performed in triplicates.
Statistical analysis. To determine the significance in differences in growth and apoptosis, the Student's t test for dependent samples was applied. Results were considered
significant when P was <0.05. Drug interactions (additive,
synergistic, and antagonistic) were determined by calculating
combination index (CI) values using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft; ref. 42). A CI value of 1 indicates an additive effect,
whereas CI values below 1 indicate synergistic drug effects.

Results
Plk1 is expressed in activated form in CML cells. As
assessed by real-time PCR, Plk1 mRNA levels were found to
be higher in primary CML cells (16 patients) compared with

www.aacrjournals.org

normal BM cells [16 donors; ΔCT BM control (10.1 ± 1.5) versus
CML (8.5 ± 1.2); P < 0.05]. Figure 1A shows the expression of
Plk1 mRNA in CML cells detected by conventional RT-PCR.
Next, we examined Plk1 protein expression in CML cells using
antibodies against total Plk1 and p-Plk1. As assessed by immunocytochemistry, K562 cells and primary CML cells were found
to express substantial amounts of Plk1 and p-Plk1, whereas
normal BM cells expressed only trace amounts of Plk1/p-Plk1
(Fig. 1B). Expression of the Plk1 protein in CML cells (K562)
could also be confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C).
Expression of Plk1 in leukemic cells is BCR/ABL dependent. To ask whether Plk1 expression is regulated by BCR/
ABL, imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant K562 cells
were incubated with imatinib and nilotinib for 24 hours. As
visible in Fig. 1C, targeting of BCR/ABL was followed by complete downregulation of Plk1 protein expression, suggesting
that Plk1 is a BCR/ABL-dependent survival factor. Recent data suggest that p38, a BCR/ABL downstream kinase, directly
binds to and activates Plk1 (43). To examine signaling pathways involved in Plk1 expression, K562 cells were exposed to
the p38 inhibitor SB203580 as well as to other signal transduction inhibitors. Interestingly, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002
and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 induced complete downregulation of expression of Plk1 in K562 cells (Fig. 1D). Moderate
effects were also observed with the MEK inhibitor PD98059
and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, whereas the JNK inhibitor SP600125 showed no effect (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that Plk1 expression in BCR/ABL+ cells is regulated
through a PI3K- and p38-dependent pathway.

Figure 2. Silencing of Plk1 with siRNA induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in K562 cells. K562 cells were kept in control medium (Control) or transfected
with siRNA against luciferase (Luc) or Plk1. Cells were harvested 24 and 48 h after transfection. A, after 24 h, Western blotting was performed using
antibodies directed against Plk1 or β-actin. B, cells were spun on cytospin slides and stained with Wright-Giemsa. C, the percentage of mitotic cells (gray
columns) and apoptotic cells (black columns) were determined after 24 and 48 h by light microscopy. Results represent the mean ± SD of three independent
experiments. *, P < 0.05 compared to control. D, top, 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow
cytometry; bottom, after 48 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by combined Annexin V/propidium iodide staining.

Targeting of Plk1 with specific siRNA counteracts cell
cycle progression and viability of K562 cells. To clarify
the functional role of Plk1 in CML cells, a siRNA against
Plk1 was applied in K562 cells (Fig. 2A). As visible in Fig. 2B
and C, the siRNA-induced Plk1 knockdown was followed by
a substantial increase in the percentage of cells arrested in mitosis. As determined by flow cytometry, cells were found to be
arrested in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle after treatment
with Plk1 siRNA for 24 hours (Fig. 2D). However, later, these
cells displayed clear signs of apoptosis, and 48 hours after
transfection, the numbers of apoptotic cells increased substantially compared with control, which was demonstrable
by light microscopy (Fig. 2B and C) and Annexin V/propidium
iodide staining (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that Plk1 is essential for cell cycle progression and survival of CML cells.
BI 2536 counteracts Plk1 expression and induces cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis in K562 cells. In a next
step, BI 2536, a pharmacologic Plk1 inhibitor, was applied.
K562 cells were incubated in control medium or in 1
μmol/L BI 2536 for 4 or 24 hours. As visible in Fig. 3A, the
Plk1 protein was found to be downregulated by BI 2536 with-

in 4 hours. We then applied BI 2536 for 1, 5, or 15 minutes.
Again, BI 2536 was found to downregulate expression of Plk1
in K562 cells at all time points (data not shown). To evaluate
BI 2536 effects on cell cycle progression and viability, K562
cells were incubated with various concentrations of BI 2536
for 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours. BI 2536 was found to induce mitotic arrest in K562 cells within 12 hours and induced apoptosis after 48 hours. Figure 3B shows the time-dependent
effect of BI 2536 (100 nmol/L) on the numbers of mitotic
and apoptotic cells. To confirm these results, cell cycle analysis was performed after 24 hours. As visible in Fig. 3C, the
percentage of cells in G2-M phase was significantly increased
after incubation with 100 nmol/L BI 2536. After 48 hours, the
proapoptotic effects of BI 2536 were confirmed by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay (Fig. 3D).
BI 2536 inhibits growth of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant BCR/ABL-positive cells. We next examined the
effects of BI 2536 on proliferation of BCR/ABL-positive cells
in [3H]thymidine uptake experiments. As visible in Table 1
and Supplementary Fig. S1, BI 2536 was found to inhibit
the growth of all BCR/ABL+ cells tested, with IC50 values

BI 2536 Inhibits Growth of CML Cells

ranging from 1 to 50 nmol/L. No apparent differences in
IC50s were found when comparing imatinib-sensitive CML
cells with imatinib-resistant cells, including primary cells
and Ba/F3 cells carrying BCR/ABL T315I (Table 1). These data suggest that BI 2536 inhibits the proliferation of CML cells
regardless of their response to imatinib or presence of BCR/
ABL mutations. No significant effect of BI 2536 was observed
in parental Ba/F3 cells, and in normal BM cells, the effect of
BI 2536 was less pronounced than in CML cells (IC50 >100
nmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S1).
BI 2536 effects on K562 cells are reverted by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. The unexpected rapidity with

which BI 2536 downregulates the expression of Plk1 in
K562 cells prompted us to ask whether protein degradation
processes are involved. Once deactivated by drugs, protein
kinases may be cleared rapidly from the cytoplasm via proteasomal degradation. To determine whether this may apply
to Plk1 downregulation induced by BI 2536, K562 cells were
coincubated with 1 μmol/L BI 2536 and 260 nmol/L bortezomib. As shown in Fig. 4A, bortezomib was found to antagonize the effects of BI 2536 on Plk1 protein expression,
suggesting that Plk1, after deactivated by BI 2536, is degraded
via the proteasome. Furthermore, bortezomib was found to
counteract the mitotic arrest produced by BI 2536 (Fig. 4B).

Figure 3. BI 2536 regulates Plk1 expression and induces cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis in K562 cells. A, K562 cells were kept in control

was analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells in G0-G1, G2-M, and S phase was calculated. Bottom, results represent the mean ± SD of three

harvested and subjected to combined Annexin V/propidium iodide staining (top) or TUNEL assay (bottom).

BI 2536 Inhibits Growth of CML Cells

No cooperative (additive or synergistic) effects of BI 2536 and
bortezomib on proliferation or induction of apoptosis in
K562 cells were seen (data not shown). Together, these data
suggest that protein degradation through the proteasome
may be associated with induction of cell death produced
by BI 2536.
BI 2536 synergizes with TKI in counteracting growth of
CML cells. Drug combinations may represent an important
option in drug-resistant CML. To determine whether BI 2536
and TKI synergize in counteracting proliferation, K562 cells,
Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR/ABL mutants, and primary CML
cells were incubated with suboptimal concentrations of BI
2536 as single agent or in combination with TKI. As visible
in Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S2, BI 2536 was found to
synergize with imatinib and nilotinib in inhibiting growth of
imatinib-resistant CML cells. Synergistic effects between BI
2536 and TKI were observed with all BCR/ABL mutants tested, including T315I (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S2).

Discussion
In most CML patients, the disease can be kept under control with imatinib (4–7). In case of resistance or intolerance,
a second-generation TKI may be prescribed (11–17). However, these patients may develop resistance against all available
TKI, which represents a clinical challenge. Therefore, current
research focuses on additional drug targets with the hope to
overcome resistance. Plk1 has recently been identified as a
potential therapeutic target in various tumors and acute leukemias (24–30). We here show that Plk1 is expressed in CML
cells and that the Plk1-targeting drug BI 2536 inhibits growth
and survival in leukemic cells. Effects of BI 2536 were seen in
imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML, including leukemic clones carrying the BCR/ABL mutation T315I that introduces resistance against most available TKI. These data
suggest that Plk1 is a potential new target in CML-cells.
The CML cell line K562 was also found to express p-Plk1,
confirming the data of Masuda and colleagues (44).
Thus far, little is known about the regulation of expression
and activation of Plk1 in neoplastic cells. In our study, the
BCR/ABL-targeting TKI imatinib and nilotinib were found
to downregulate expression of Plk1 in K562 cells, suggesting
that Plk1 expression is BCR/ABL dependent. To define BCR/
ABL downstream signal pathways involved in Plk1 expression, we applied signal transduction inhibitors. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580, and to a
lesser degree inhibitors of MEK and mTOR, were found to
downregulate expression of Plk1 in K562 cells. These data
suggest that multiple signaling pathways are involved in
the regulation of expression of Plk1.
Recent data suggest that Plk1 is a major regulator of cell
cycle progression (24, 25). We examined the function of Plk1
in CML cells by applying Plk1 siRNA. The Plk1 knockdown
was followed by cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis
in K562 cells, confirming data obtained in solid tumor cells
(29, 30). These observations suggest that Plk1 is a regulator of
cell growth and thus a potential target in CML cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

BI 2536 is a pharmacologic inhibitor of Plk1 known to
block the growth of various neoplastic cells (32–35). In this
study, BI 2536 induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in
K562 cells and primary CML cells in all patients tested. In
untreated patients, the IC50 values for BI 2536 ranged from
1 to 15 nmol/L, which is within the pharmacologic range
of the drug. A similar IC50 value was found in K562 cells, confirming previous data (33). One of the most intriguing effects
of BI 2536 was cell cycle arrest observed after a relatively
short incubation time. In fact, >50% of all cells treated with
BI 2536 showed mitotic arrest after 24 hours, whereas apoptosis occurred at a later time point (48 hours), suggesting
that Plk1 is a primary target of BI 2536 in CML cells, whereas
apoptosis may be a secondary event (45).
An unexpected observation was that BI 2536 rapidly downregulates expression of total Plk1 in CML cells. Because deactivated target proteins are often degraded rapidly through
the proteasome, we applied the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. This drug was indeed found to counteract the BI
2536–induced downregulation of Plk1 expression in K562
cells, suggesting that the BI 2536–targeted form of Plk1
may be degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway.
Resistance to imatinib is an emerging problem in the
treatment of CML (9–11). We asked whether BI 2536 would
exert growth-inhibitory effects in imatinib-resistant CML
cells and Ba/F3 cells expressing various imatinib-resistant
mutants of BCR/ABL. BI 2536 was found to block proliferation in all cell lines tested, with IC50 values ranging from 5
to 15 nmol/L for K562 cells and from 10 to 50 nmol/L for
the Ba/F3 clones analyzed, without major differences observed when comparing IC50 values in the various BCR/
ABL mutants examined. Similarly, BI 2536 produced growth
arrest in primary CML cells in all imatinib-resistant patients
tested, with similar IC50 values, including CML cells harboring BCR/ABL T315I, a mutant conferring resistance against
all available TKIs.
Several different treatment concepts in CML focus on drug
combinations (39, 40, 46). We observed synergistic effects
when combining BI 2536 with imatinib or nilotinib. Synergistic
drug actions were seen not only in K562 cells and untreated
patients but also in imatinib-resistant cells, including those
carrying BCR/ABL T315I. The mechanism of synergy between
BI 2536 and BCR/ABL TKI remains unknown. One possibility
may be that the cell cycle arrest produced by BI 2536 leads to
enhanced responsiveness against imatinib/nilotinib. A similar
mechanism has been proposed for imatinib and cisplatin in
squamous cell carcinomas (47). Another explanation may be
that BI 2536 leads to enhanced drug uptake and/or accumulation of TKI in leukemic cells. A direct effect of BI 2536 on BCR/
ABL could be excluded. All in all, our data suggest that drug
combinations using BI 2536 and TKI exert substantial antileukemic effects in TKI-resistant CML. However, not all drug
combinations may produce such cooperative effects in CML,
as exemplified for “imatinib + bortezomib” treatment.
Together, our study shows that Plk1 represents an interesting target in CML. Clinical trials are now warranted to define the value of this new target and to confirm anti-CML
effects of these drugs.
