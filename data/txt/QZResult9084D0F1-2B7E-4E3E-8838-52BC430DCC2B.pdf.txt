ABSTRACT:
High expression of Rac small GTPases in invasive breast ductal carcinoma is
associated with poor prognosis, but its therapeutic value in human cancers is not
clear. The aim of the current study was to determine the response of human primary
breast cancers to Rac-based drug treatments ex vivo.
Three-dimensional organotypic cultures were used to assess candidate
therapeutic avenues in invasive breast cancers. Uniquely, in these primary cultures,
the tumour is not disaggregated, with both epithelial and mesenchymal components
maintained within a three-dimensional matrix of type I collagen. EHT 1864, a small
molecule inhibitor of Rac GTPases, prevents spread of breast cancers in this setting,
and also reduces proliferation at the invading edge. Rac1+ epithelial cells in breast
tumours also contain high levels of the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor
STAT3. The small molecule Stattic inhibits activation of STAT3 and induces effects
similar to those seen with EHT 1864. Pan-Rac inhibition of proliferation precedes
down-regulation of STAT3 activity, defining it as the last step in Rac activation during
human breast cancer invasion.
Our data highlights the potential use of Rac and STAT3 inhibition in treatment
of invasive human breast cancer and the benefit of studying novel cancer treatments
using three-dimensional primary tumour tissue explant cultures.

INTRODUCTION

evaluate new treatments.
The metastatic potential of cancer cells is
orchestrated by cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion,
protrusion and contractility, all of which require
appropriate regulation and dynamics of the cytoskeleton
[6]. The Ras-like Rho family GTPases are key regulators
of all of these cellular processes due to their interaction
with multiple downstream targets. The ability of Rac1 to
induce metastasis has been closely linked to mesenchymal
type motility in cancer cell lines [7-9]. This is likely to
be due to Rac activity near the cell leading edge and
subsequent disruption of cellular organization [10, 11].
Nonetheless, Rac activity must be tightly regulated in
order to maintain normal epithelial cell junction formation,
polarization and proliferation [12-14].

In recent years there has been a growing
appreciation that developing new effective treatments may
be facilitated by experimental systems that replicate the
multi-component tumour environment [1, 2]. Furthermore,
there are serious doubts regarding the relevance of drug
testing in established cancer cell lines and transfer of
results to the clinic [3]. We have developed a threedimensional culture system that allows maintenance of
complex breast cancer specimens explanted ex vivo for
up to four weeks after surgical resection in a supporting
matrix of exogenous stromal type I collagen [4, 5]. These
ex vivo cultures offer a relatively rapid and quantitative
avenue to explore mechanisms of tumour spread and

Rac activation can induce invasion and metastasis
of breast cancer cell line models in vitro and in vivo [15].
Over-expression of Rac1 and Rac3 GTPases has been
noted in several small cohorts of breast cancers [16-18]
and it has been suggested that they may have a role in
resistance to endocrine treatment [19, 20]. In breast
cancer, this mechanism is best described in the context of
HER2 over-expression. As a result of TGFβ stimulation, a
complex comprising HER2, Vav2, Rac1, Pak1, actin and
actinin is formed at cell protrusions [21]. The induction of
Rac1 activity by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF) Vav2 causes invasion and contributes to cancer cell
survival [20] and disruption of correct polarisation of the
breast epithelium [22]. Other GEFs may also stimulate
Rac1 downstream of HER2, including P-REX1 [22]. Upregulation of Rac1 activity by P-REX1 and Tiam1 GEFs
has been described independently of tumour HER2 status

[21], although the latter finding is disputed [23].
Across a panel of 51 established breast cell lines
[24], both normal and malignant, similar, detectable
levels of Rac1 mRNA were observed. The levels of Rac2
and Rac3 transcripts were more variable, being reliably
detected in less than half of the cell lines (our unpublished
observations). Studies of Rac function using cell lines
already have contributed to understanding of initiation of
malignant transformation, but do not inform how intact
human tumours may respond to therapeutic intervention
[25]. We previously reported that the majority of invasive
human breast cancers continue to express E-cadherin and
β-catenin correctly at the cell membrane junctions [26].
Therefore, pan-Rac inhibition of the whole, intact breast
tumour explant could potentially bring about apparently
conflicting effects on epithelial versus mesenchymal cells.
It may lead to destruction of epithelial junctions enabling

invasiveness, while blocking mesenchymal motility.
In this study we examine the response of authentic
primary breast cancers to Rac-based drug treatments.
We show that invasive breast cancers are responsive to
exposure to EHT1864, a water soluble pan-Rac inhibitor.
Consequently, Rac inhibition blocks a key downstream effector, the Signal Transducer and Activator of
Transcription-3 (STAT3) transcription factor. We show
that Rac and STAT3 inhibition regimens are effective at
blocking tumour invasion ex vivo, independently of known
clinical biomarkers such as histological grade and ER
status.

its mRNA expression levels in published gene expression
datasets. RAC1 was found to be significantly higher
expressed in breast tumours than in normal breast tissue
(Figure 1A). We then used a meta dataset of 2999 primary
breast tumours (see Methods) to explore whether RAC1
expression associated with particular subtypes of breast
tumours. There was no significant variation in RAC1
levels with grade or ER status (Figure 1B-C). RAC1 was
significantly higher and associated with poor prognosis in
HER2 (ERBB2) over-expressing tumours, although the
range of RAC1 expression was similar between HER2+
and HER2- tumours (Figure S1). Importantly, high levels
of RAC1 were associated with late recurrence (Figure
1D). Overall, these data suggest that RAC1 may represent
a therapeutic target with broad potential in breast cancer,
because it does not show a strong association with
particular patient groups.
We have recently succeeded in establishing a robust
system for long-term culture of human breast cancer
explants, successfully growing >90% tumours of all major
sub-types [4, 5]. In these cultures, primary breast cancer
biopsies from invasive breast cancers are explanted into

Rac inhibition blocks the spread of human breast
cancer

the centre of a type I collagen matrix. From each tumour
cultured ex vivo, 80%-100% of explants are viable and
display variable degrees of cellular spread into the
surrounding collagen [4]. Growth in mammary epithelial
media occurs in all three dimensions, as demonstrated
optical projection tomography (Figure 1E; cytokeratin
labels epithelial structures (green) invading from the
original biopsy material into the surrounding collagen).
We found that in many breast cancers grown ex vivo,
both Rac1 and its constitutively active isoform Rac1b,
are preferentially expressed in invading cells (Figures 1F
and S2; n=6) when assessed by immnunohistochemistry.
Importantly, both isoforms are expressed in tumour
epithelial and mesenchymal cells, indicating wide spread
Rac activity.

We used EHT 1864, a water soluble pan-Rac
inhibitor [27], to determine the value of Rac inhibition
in the explant model. EHT1864 exhibits high affinity
binding to Rac1, as well as the related Rac1b, Rac2, and
Rac3 isoforms, inhibiting their activity via a mechanism
that involves guanine nucleotide displacement [27]. EHT
1864 has been used previously in cell line models in
2D, especially in the context of Rac1 activity [19, 28].
Continuous treatment of breast cancer explant cultures
with EHT 1864 for 14 days resulted in complete block of
invasion into the surrounding collagen, and wide spread
cell death (Figure 2A). We characterised the effects
of Rac inhibition in two regimens: in the first regimen,

Figure 3: Rac inhibition with of tumour outgrowth ex vivo results in block of proliferation and cell death. (A) The effect

of treatment with EHT 1864 or vehicle control on outgrowth of tumour cultures was obtained from light microscopy examination and
subsequently confirmed by H&E staining. Shown are reperentative results from ER- HER2- tumour explant culture lasting 14d (n=4). Note
that continuous EHT1854 treatment reduces viable outgrowth (regimen #4) in comparison to short-treatment (#2) or vehicle control (#1).

explants from the same cancer were divided randomly to
equally sized treatments groups and treated continuously
for 14 days (Figure 2B). In the second regimen, explant
cultures were left to grow out for 10 days, and then
divided randomly to treatment groups for a further 14 days
(Figure 2C). Both regimens resulted in almost complete
elimination of tumour outgrowth into the surrounding
collagen. Using logistic regression, Rac inhibition with
EHT 1864 exhibited an odds ratio of 0.01 of outgrowth
compared with vehicle (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.003 to
0.04).

tumours have a wide range of proliferation from 10%
to 60% of cells [5], but exposure to EHT 1864 reduced
proliferation to less than 5% (Figure 3C). Interestingly,
levels of E-cadherin expression were very similar with or
without EHT 1864 treatment (Figure 3D).

STAT3 is a down-stream mediator of Rac activity
in breast cancer spread
A cell line 3D model was established to assess the
potential contribution of Rac1 down-stream targets in
epithelial cell invasion. We modified our collagen-based
invasion culture [29] using the HCC1954 cell line, which
invades in organised fashion in vivo [30]. In 3D culture,
HCC1954 cells express proteins such as E-cadherin in a
similar manner to this observed in tumour cells cultured
ex vivo (Figure S3). In the absence of serum, HCC1954
cells invade collectively (Figure S4A). Treatment of the
cell line culture with EHT 1864 resulted in rapid (<24
h) inhibition of invasion and appearance of apoptotic
cells (Figures S5A). Surviving HCC1954 cells were still
positive for Ki67, a marker of proliferation (Figure S5B).
The effects of pan-Rac inhibition in the cell line model
could not be replicated by inhibitors against many known
Rac downstream mediators: JNK (SP600125), PAK (IPA3)
or p38α (SB203580) (data not shown).
Another well established Rac1 target is

Rac inhibition blocks proliferation and induces
apoptosis in human breast cancers
Tumour outgrowth resumed if Rac inhibition
was removed after 3 days of treatment (Figure 3A; 4
independent experiments), indicating that EHT 1864
treatment is not solely as a result of cytotoxicity. We
therefore examined what down-stream effects on apoptosis
(assessed by demonstration of cleaved caspase-3) and
proliferation (as assessed by Ki67). The number of cells
undergoing cell death at the experimental endpoint rose
from a basal level of <20% in vehicle-treated tumours
[5] to 30%-50% of cells treated with EHT 1864. These
cells were found predominantly around the periphery of
the original tumour explant (Figure 3B). Vehicle-treated

cancer. Epithelial cells which are Rac1+ pSTAT3- are also present. (B) STAT3 phosphorylation is associated with invasion ex vivo and is
down regulated by Rac inhibition (right panels; inhibition as in Figure 2). Identical patterns are seen with the STAT3 transcriptional target

phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 is [31]. We examined
Rac1 and phospho-Ser727 STAT3 levels by antibody
staining in human breast tumours (n=6). Patterns Rac1 and
phospho-Ser727 STAT3 staining are similar, especially
in epithelial cells (Figure 4A). Phospho-Ser727 STAT3
staining is abundant in the invading cells ex vivo (Figure
4B and S6A). In the HCC1954 model, Rac inhibition
resulted in reduction in phospho-Ser727 STAT3 (Figure
S6A). Survivin, a well established target of STAT3
transcriptional activity [32], is also down-regulated by
EHT 1864 treatment of cell line cultures (Figure S7B).
Some HCC1954 cells survived Rac inhibition for 24 h,
retaining both phospho-Ser727 STAT3 and Survivin

(Figure S5, arrows).

Block of proliferation by Rac inhibition ex vivo
precedes down-regulation of STAT3 activity
We tested whether long-term Rac inhibition also
blocks STAT3 activity in the explant tumour cultures. The
intensity of phospho-Ser727 STAT3 staining ex vivo was
greatly reduced by EHT 1864 (Figure 4B). Consistent with
STAT3 activity down-stream of Rac, EHT 1864 treatment
resulted in down-regulation of Survivin protein expression
(Figures 4C). Interestingly, cells initially surviving Rac

to inhibitor treatment in order to define events induced by a single post-growth treatment. Immunohistochemistry suggest that STAT3
phosphorylation (vehicle, left panels) is down regulated by EHT 1864 (middle panels) or Stattic (right panels) within 72 h of treatment.
(B) Wide spread apoptosis is detected in Stattic treated cultures (right panel) and to lesser extent in EHT 1864 treated cultures (middle

1864 (middle panel) or Stattic (right panel) exposed cultures). The dotted lines show border between original tumour explant (OT) and

inhibition retained both nuclear localization of phosphoSer727 STAT3 and Survivin ex vivo (arrows).
STAT3 may be indirectly controlled by Rac via an
autocrine or paracrine signal [33, 34]. We examined if
there are short-term effects of Rac inhibition preceding
changes in STAT3 activity ex vivo. The role of STAT3
downstream of Rac activation was confirmed using Stattic,
an inhibitor of dimerization and nuclear translocation of
STAT3 preventing its constitutive activation [35]. After
one round of treatment with EHT 1864, only a partial
reduction in phospho-Ser727 STAT3 and Survivin staining
can be observed by immunohistochemistry (Figure 5A and
not shown). The rapid induction of apoptosis by STAT3
inhibition in comparison to Rac inhibition, supports
a more direct effect of STAT3 inhibition (Figure 5B).
Importantly, proliferation within the invading cells is
greatly reduced by both inhbitors (Figure 5C), suggesting

most likely through down-regulation of cyclin D1 (Figure
5D), a known Rac1 and STAT3 target [36-39]. The
dramatic induction of apoptosis by Stattic is even more
pronounced than this caused by EHT 1864, in line with
previous reports in breast cancer cell lines [35, 40-42].
Stattic treatment has similar long-term effects to
those seen with EHT 1864 on tumour invasion ex vivo
(Figure 6). Using logistic regression, STAT3 inhibition
with Stattic exhibited an odds ratio of 0.003 (p < 0.0001,
95% CI 0.001 to 0.018) compared with vehicle.

DISCUSSION
Although endocrine (for ER+ tumours), cytotoxic
chemotherapy (for ER- tumours) or Herceptin (for HER2+
tumours) regimens are successful treatments for some
breast cancer patients, mortality due to recurrence of

cancers which develop drug resistance and metastases
is still common [43]. Therefore, identification of novel
treatment for metastatic breast cancer is important
to enhance long term patient survival [44]. As direct
measurements of enzymatic activity in human tumours are
difficult and possibly inaccurate due to clinical constrains
in sample collection, other methods are need to evaluate
such novel treatments.
The over-expression of Rho GTPases has previously
been implicated in the promotion of various cancer types
[16, 45]. It is also well established that Rho, Cdc42 and
particularly Rac1 have critical roles in experimental
tumour metastasis [33, 38]. It is usually thought that Rac
activity in cancer is associated with the loss of epithelial
cell-cell junctions and gain of mesenchymal phenotype
[46]. Many signaling pathways lie downstream of Rac
proteins, although their relationship to malignancy is not
always clearly understood. These include the activation
of JNK and p38 proteins [47], as well as non-canonical
(β-catenin-independent) WNT signaling pathways [48]. It
has been suggested that the constitutively active isoforms
Rac1b and Rac3 show pathway preference, which is
distinct from that of the GEF-dependent isoforms Rac1
and Rac2 [8, 16, 49].
Here, we have shown that the spread of breast
tumours in an ex vivo model is sensitive to Rac inhibition.
This 3D culture model recapitulates epithelial invasion
of human breast cancer tumours in vivo, in particular
maintaining E-cadherin membrane expression, unlike
invasive breast cancer cell lines [26, 29]. Recent evidence
links proliferation and invasion to the spread of cancer,
both of which are inhibited in our model system upon
EHT 1864 exposure [33, 50]. Moreover, a study in mouse
melanoblasts suggested a role for Rac1 in proliferation
of motile cells, although the exact mechanism was not
identified [51].
Our experiments demonstrate that an approach
involving pan-Rac inhibition has the potential to be
applied to the clinic. In the current study, inhibition
of all Rac isoforms by EHT1864 in explants of intact
primary cancers prevented spread into collagen, reduced
proliferation and subsequently caused apoptosis. The
reduction in cyclin D1 levels by Rac inhibition did not
result in greater invasiveness, as reported in MDAMB-231 cells [52]. EHT 1864 blocks the constitutively
active Rac1b and Rac3 isoforms [27], unlike the more
widely used Rac GEF inhibitor NSC23766. EHT 1864
is likely to be superior to using a Rac GEF inhibitor,
which will not have any effect on the Rac1b or Rac3,
long considered to be associated with breast cancer
aggressiveness [8, 16]. To date, a range of in vitro and in
vivo models has not reported any significant cytotoxicity
associated with EHT 1864. This represents a therapeutic
opportunity as breast cancers should have higher over-all
Rac activity than this of the surrounding normal breast.
We have demonstrated, at the breast cancer tissue
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

level, a link between STAT3 and Rac proteins. STAT3
is a critical transcription factor regulating cell death
during breast involution [53], but it can also function as
an oncogene [39]. STAT3 activity (in absence of STAT5
activity) has been shown previously to be present in 40%
of human breast cancers and has been linked to higher
grade and lymph node metastasis [54]. STAT3 inhibition
has a clear anti-tumour effect as demonstrated by a variety
of reagents [42, 55]. It is conceivable that disruption of
the feedback loop between Rac1 and E-cadherin adherens
junctions could lead to aberrant STAT3 activation in breast
cancer [56].
The current study suggests that invasion of breast
cancer is associated with up-regulation of Rac and STAT3
activity. The challenge now is to understand which
breast cancer patients may be most suited for Rac-based
treatment, once a drug is available for human use. Our
finding that patients with HER2high RAC1high tumours
have the worst prognosis, suggests that Rac targeting in
the clinic may particularly benefit patients with HER2+
tumours. This is supported by recent experiments in
mice suggesting that gp130/STAT3 signalling is critical
in HER2-induced tumourigenesis [57]. Our findings
that even after exhaustive Rac inhibition in intact breast
tumour, STAT3 activity is detected in rare live cells
suggest that optimal treatment may require a combination
of drugs inhibiting Rac and STAT3 activities.

Collagen-based 3D cultures

Immunohistochemistry

The set-up of collagen type I-based cultures, ex vivo
and cell line, was described in detail previously [4, 29].
For cell line cultures, 75 μL or 150 μL cell-Matrigel
plugs were made using 2 x 106 cells/ml and 5mg/ml
Matrigel (BD bioscience), in a U-shaped 96-well plate.
After overnight incubation, cell plugs were carefully
removed from their 96-well plate and embedded in 1 ml
of rat collagen I (1 mg/ml) in a 24-well plate or 2 ml of
collagen in a 12-well plate. These cultures were incubated
for a further 1 h and then carefully freed from the edges
of the well (to allow contraction of the collagen) and
supplemented with 1 ml or 2 ml RPMI media (without
serum). The cells were then left to invade. Media was
changed every 3-5 days. Rac inhibitor (EHT 1864, Tocris
#3872, 20 μM) or STAT3 inhibitor (Stattic, Tocris #2798,
10 μM) were added at the last 24 h or 96 h.
For ex vivo cultures, breast tumour biopsy materials
(cut to 1mm pieces) were explated instead of Matrigel
plugs in a 24-well plate format. The media used ex vivo is
complete MEGM (Lonza). Continuous inhibitor treatment
lasted between days 1-14. For late addition assays, assays
with viable growth at day 6 or 8 (as observed using a light
microscope) were divided to equal size groups (> 4 assays
per treatment). Treatment with inhibitor or appropriate
vehicle control lasted for subsequent 12 days. Inhibitors
were added at concentrations as above every 3 days. In
experiments represented in Figure 4, tumours (n=4) were
allowed to grown for 7-14 d prior to inhibitor treatment
lasting 3 additional days. Quantification of positive
nuclei in invading cells was performed on entire sections
obtained from the same tumour (>90 cells/preparation).
To terminate all experiments, cultures were fixed in
10% phosphate buffered formalin and wax embedded.

Antigen retrieval for all staining was performed
using sodium citrate buffer (18 μM Citric Acid, 82 μM
sodium citrate, pH 6.0). Standard immunohistochemistry

Categorisation of effects on explant outgrowths ex
vivo
After 14 d of treatment with either Rac inhibitior
(EHT 1864) or STAT3 inhibitor (Stattic), all preparations
were inspected using live microscopy. Cell invasion from
the original tumour explant into the surrounding collagen
is typically observed after 6-8 d from start of culture [5].
At each experimental time point, media was removed and
cellular outgrowths ware determined by light microscopy
(x10 magnification). The viability of outgrowths was
confirmed subsequently using H&E sections from the
fixed preparations.

and subsequently with a fluorescein-conjugated secondary
antibody (Invitrogen). The preparation was mounted in 1%
low melting agarose and dehydrated in 100% Methanol for
24 h. The specimen was cleared in BABB solution (1:2
Benzyl alcohol, Benzyl benzoate) for 24 h and scanned
using the Optical Projection Tomograph (Bioptonics
3001M). Both target and auto-fluorescence were captured
using a GFP+ filter and GFP1 filter respectively.
