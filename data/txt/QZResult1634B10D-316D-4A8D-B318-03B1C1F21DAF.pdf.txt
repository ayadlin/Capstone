Abstract
Multiple myeloma cells secrete more disulﬁde bond–rich
proteins than any other mammalian cell. Thus, inhibition of
protein disulﬁde isomerases (PDI) required for protein folding
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) should increase ER stress
beyond repair in this incurable cancer. Here, we report the
mechanistically unbiased discovery of a novel PDI-inhibiting
compound with antimyeloma activity. We screened a 30,355
small-molecule library using a multilayered multiple myeloma
cell–based cytotoxicity assay that modeled disease niche, normal liver, kidney, and bone marrow. CCF642, a bone marrow–
sparing compound, exhibited a submicromolar IC50 in 10 of 10
multiple myeloma cell lines. An active biotinylated analog of
CCF642 deﬁned binding to the PDI isoenzymes A1, A3, and A4
in MM cells. In vitro, CCF642 inhibited PDI reductase activity
about 100-fold more potently than the structurally distinct

established inhibitors PACMA 31 and LOC14. Computational
modeling suggested a novel covalent binding mode in activesite CGHCK motifs. Remarkably, without any further chemistry
optimization, CCF642 displayed potent efﬁcacy in an aggressive syngeneic mouse model of multiple myeloma and prolonged the lifespan of C57BL/KaLwRij mice engrafted with
5TGM1-luc myeloma, an effect comparable to the ﬁrst-line
multiple myeloma therapeutic bortezomib. Consistent with
PDI inhibition, CCF642 caused acute ER stress in multiple
myeloma cells accompanied by apoptosis-inducing calcium
release. Overall, our results provide an illustration of the
utility of simple in vivo simulations as part of a drug discovery
effort, along with a sound preclinical rationale to develop a
new small-molecule therapeutic to treat multiple myeloma.

Introduction

multiple myeloma (3). Proteins destined for secretion enter the
ER in an incompletely folded state and factors commonly found
in cancer, like augmented protein synthesis, nutrient deﬁciency,
and hypoxia increase them or impair their folding exerting ER
stress (4). In multiple myeloma, high protein synthesis related to
neoplastic behavior is ampliﬁed by plasma cell program activation yielding the highest protein secretion rate known in mammalian biology (5). Furthermore, secreted antibodies have complex folding needs involving correct arrangement of multiple
intra- and intermolecular disulﬁde bonds (5, 6). If misfolded
proteins accumulate in the ER gradually induction of the transcription factor CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) triggers
suicide (4) whereas acute misfolding events like severe hypoxia
cause apoptosis via opening of ER calcium channels (7). One way
cells attempt to evade such fate is by transport of misfolded ER
proteins into the cytoplasm for ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation (8, 9). Interference with disposal of naturally occurring misfolded antibodies appears critical for clinical success of
the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in multiple myeloma (10,
11), suggesting a blockade of the folding mechanism could
further improve multiple myeloma therapy. Only the family of
protein disulﬁde isomerases (PDI), which contains 17 members
with 1–4 active CXXC or CXXC-like motifs (12), can accomplish
correct arrangement of disulﬁde bonds in the ER through reductase, oxidase, and isomerase functions.
To streamline selection of anti–multiple myeloma drug candidates for further study, we chose a mechanistically unbiased
approach and ﬁltered compounds by assessment in one

Despite progress, multiple myeloma remains largely incurable,
recruiting relapses from genetically heterogeneous multiple myeloma subclones (1, 2). Cytopenias from cumulative treatment
toxicity and refractory multiple myeloma limit therapeutic
options and lifespan creating need for bone marrow sparing
approaches effective against genetically highly variable myeloma
cell populations.
Defense against stress misfolded proteins exert on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been identiﬁed as Achilles heel of

Myeloma Control with Protein Disulﬁde Isomerase Inhibition

multilayered assay modeling major barriers to clinical success;
liver metabolism, need for diffusion, transient exposure, myeloma-supporting niche, and bone marrow toxicity. The lead compound (CCF642) had broad anti–multiple myeloma activity, was
effective in vivo, and appeared to act, at least in part, by inhibition
of PDI through a novel mechanism. Here we describe the discovery and initial characterization of CCF642.

Materials and Methods
Cells
RPMI 8226, NCI-H929, MM1.S, MM1.R, U266, Jeko-1, Rec-1,
Mino, JVM-2, SU-DHL-6, SU-DHL-16, K562, KG-1, GDM-1, and
HS-5 were from ATCC (authenticated there by STR). KMS-12-PE
and KMS-12-BM were from JCRB (authenticated there by STR)
and JJN-3 from DSMZ (authenticated there by multiplex PCR of
minisatellite markers). 5TGM1-luc mouse multiple myeloma
cells were kindly provided by Dr. Babatunde O. Oyajobi, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (San Antonio,
TX), where this cell line was discovered and characterized (13–
16). All of the above cells were kept in culture for less than 6
months including expansion for aliquot freezing. HRMM.09 cells
were established from blood of a patient with secondary plasma
cell leukemia under Institutional Review Board (IRB)–approved
consent in our laboratory. MM1.S-luc, HRMM.09-luc, and NCIH292-luc were transduced with ﬁreﬂy luciferase lentivirus (Qiagen), not further authenticated, but used within 6 months after
luciferase expression conﬁrmation. Anti-CD138 magnetic bead–
puriﬁed peripheral blood plasma cells from two patients with
secondary plasma cell leukemia (sPCL-1, -2) who consented to an
IRB-approved sample collection protocol were used after 4 weeks
in culture and one Ficoll density centrifugation to remove dead
cells. Normal bone marrow mononuclear (NLBM) cells were from
discarded bags of bone marrow grafts from healthy stem cell
donors under an IRB-approved consent waiver. Human multiple
myeloma cells were grown in RPMI 1640, 5TGM1-luc in IMDM,
HS-5 in DMEM, and NLBM cells in RPMI supplemented with 25%
(v/v) of supernatant removed from conﬂuent HS-5 cell cultures;
all media was supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin G (50 units/
mL), and streptomycin (50 mg/mL). All cells cultured at 37 C, 5%
CO2 in humidiﬁed air.
Primary screen
A total of 30,335 chemically diverse small molecules were
screened for anti–multiple myeloma activity in MM1.S cells using
a single-step cellular ATP quantitation assay (Supplementary
Table S1 and Supplementary Methods).
Multilayered (sandwich) in vivo model
HS-5 bone marrow stromal cells were grown to conﬂuence on
semipermeable bottoms of 24-well Transwell inserts (Corning),
then MM1.S-luc cells were added and cocultured overnight. The
next day, drug candidate was suspended into C57BL/KaLwRij
mouse liver homogenate (preparation in Supplementary Methods), incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes, then mixed with 35–40 C
warm low gelling temperature liquid agarose (Sigma-Aldrich),
and immediately dispensed into 24-well plates where it was
allowed to solidify at room temperature for 30 minutes. NLBM
cells were layered on top and left there, whereas HS-5/MM1.S-luc
cell containing inserts were moved after 1 to 3 hours with about
25% of the drug-equilibrated media in them into drug-free liver/

agarose/media wells to decrease concentrations of drugs by estimated 75% once a new equilibrium is reached, assuming no liver
metabolism occurs. Three to 4 days later, multiple myeloma
luciferase activity was measured after addition of ﬁreﬂy D-luciferin, 0.5 mg/mL (Gold Biotechnology), and viability of aspirated
NLBM cells was assessed by trypan blue exclusion using Vicell ﬂow
(Beckman Coulter).
Medicinal chemistry
CCF642, biotinylated CCF642 (B-CCF642), and CCF642COOH were synthesized in our laboratories. Synthetic schemes
and graphs conﬁrming their identity by 1H-NMR and mass
spectrometry are in Supplementary Methods and Fig. S1,
respectively.
PDI activity
PDI activity was measured according to a published protocol
using di-eosin-diglutathione (di-E-GSSG) as pseudo substrate for
sensitive assessment of PDI's reductase activity (17) with minor
modiﬁcations and details in Supplementary Methods.
Computational modeling and molecular dynamics
The computational model used the reduced PDI (NP_000909.2)
crystal structure (18), as binding of biotinylated CCF642 to PDI was
enhanced after reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT). Docking of
CCF642 on PDI (PDB ID: 4EKZ) used Autodock 4.1 (in Autodock
Tools 1.5.2). Binding energy calculations used CHARMM force ﬁeld
in Discovery Studio 1.3 pipeline (Accelrys, Inc.). Final image
processing and electrostatic surface potential calculation used
Pymol (www.pymol.org).
Single-cell cytoplasmic calcium measurements
MM1.S cells were loaded with Fura 2-AM and dynamic changes
in cytoplasmic calcium concentration were measured by singlecell digital imaging as described previously in detail (19).
PDIA1 site-directed mutagenesis
Human cDNA clone NM_000918 (Origene) was subcloned
from pCMV6-XL4 into pT7CFE1-CHis (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
for site-directed mutagenesis (primer sequences in Supplementary Methods) using QuikChange II XL (Agilent Technologies).
Proteins were puriﬁed with His-tagged puriﬁcation miniprep-kit
(Clontech).
Protein S-nitrosylation
Protein S-nitrosylation was investigated via biotin switch method using Cayman Chemical kit (cat.# 10006518) according to
manufacturer's instructions.
Genotoxicity screen
Genotoxicity screen used SOS chromotest kit with S9 rat liver
enzymes (ebpi) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Animal experiments
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH,
and conducted under an approved Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee protocol. C57BL/KaLwRij mice (Harlan Laboratories) of 6 to 8 weeks of age were injected with 5TGM1-luc cells via
tail vein the day before drug treatments were started. CCF642
was administered as albumin formulation intraperitoneally,

software (SAS Institute, Inc.). Retro-orbital plexus blood draws
were done after isoﬂurane (3%) inhalation anesthesia and complete blood counts obtained on Hemavet 950FS (Drew Scientiﬁc),

Results
Mechanistically unbiased discovery of antimyeloma compound
CCF642
To identify new clinically translatable treatments for the incurable cancer multiple myeloma that disrupt critical programs for
this malignancy while sparing normal bone marrow, we used a
mechanistically unbiased algorithm on a library of 30,335 small
molecules (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst step tested for anti–multiple myeloma
activity. It identiﬁed 225 compounds that suppressed cellular ATP
in MM1.S cells to 30% of vehicle control at 5 mmol/L after 3 to
4 days (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Step two sought to
ﬁlter these 225 agents for clinical promise in terms of relative
tolerance by NLBM and ability to overcome pharmacokinetic and

pharmacodynamic barriers to anti–multiple myeloma activity.
Emitted from agarose-embedded liver homogenate that was able
to reduce the activity of hepatically metabolized bortezomib
(Supplementary Fig. S2); only three drug candidates demonstrated
promising anti–multiple myeloma activity in a setup that included
resistance conferring HS-5 bone marrow stroma cells (21) as niche
and a method to decrease drug concentrations through nonhepatic means after 90 minutes by transfer of MM1.S-luc/HS-5
containing semipermeable inserts into drug-free liver/agarose/
media containing wells. None of the three hits inhibited the
number of surviving NLBM cells by more than 30%, although
they were exposed to drug-emitting liver constantly for 4 days
(Figs. 1 and 2B). Bortezomib, known to be relatively well tolerated
by normal bone marrow at doses needed to control multiple
myeloma, had a similar therapeutic window in this assay (Fig. 2B).
In the third step, we tested whether compounds targeted
programs of general importance in multiple myeloma via cytotoxicity assessment in a cell line panel. All three hits of step 2 had
sub- or low micromolar IC50 (<5 mmol/L) against all of at least
seven genetically heterogeneous multiple myeloma cell lines
tested per compound using trypan blue ﬂow cytometry with
constant exposure over 72 hours (Fig. 2C). CCF642 was most
potent with submicromolar IC50 in 10 of 10 multiple myeloma
cell lines tested (Fig. 2C).
Step four asked whether the in vivo model indeed yielded
molecules with in vivo activity. To this end, we used an aggressive
syngeneic mouse model of myeloma (15) that causes typical
myeloma bone disease and death of C57BL/KaLwRij mice about
1 to 2 months after tail vein injection of luciferase expressing
5TGM1 cells (5TGM1-luc). 5TGM1-luc mouse multiple myeloma
cells were included in the otherwise human multiple myeloma
cell line panel (Fig. 2C) to ensure the target was expressed in mice
as well. Limited solubility could be addressed by dissolving
DMSO stock of CCF642 and CCF1172 into albumin solution,
which had no toxicity as vehicle on multiple myeloma cells and
did not affect potency of hits against multiple myeloma cells in
vitro, but the best solution we identiﬁed for CCF1118, 0.8%
Tween-20 in sterile water, did not allow dosing above 4 mg/kg.
With these limitations in mind, CCF642 at 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally three times a week yielded most convincing therapeutic
effects, signiﬁcantly prolonging life of 5TGM1-luc–bearing mice
and suppressing 5TGM1-luc growth as determined by life imaging
(Fig. 2D). We therefore concentrated on CCF642 and initially
evaluated cytotoxicity against other hematologic malignancies,
which revealed similar IC50 in ontogenetically related lymphoma,
whereas a three–cell line screening sample of myeloid neoplasia
showed more varied responsiveness. Primary cells from patients
with refractory myeloma who developed secondary plasma cell
leukemia (sPCL) also had IC50 below 1 mmol/L, whereas three
separate NLBM samples conﬁrmed NLBM tolerance up to 6.75
mmol/L, the maximal dose tested (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Next, we compared CCF642 to the most potent FDA-approved
upfront drug for myeloma, bortezomib. CCF642 at 10 mg/kg
intraperitoneally three times a week signiﬁcantly improved lifespan of mice compared with albumin vehicle. Bortezomib given
at the MTD for this mouse strain (0.6 mg/kg subcutaneously twice
a week) yielded similar prolongation of life, not statistically
different from CCF642 (P ¼ 0.18, log-rank test), and life imaging
on day 23 documented comparable signiﬁcant suppression of
5TGM1-luc growth. Treatments appeared to be well-tolerated on
the basis of normal behavior and stable weights (Fig. 3A–C). To

explore safety further, blood after 15 and 28 days of treatment
from ﬁve additional 5TGM1-luc–bearing mice per time point was
obtained to screen for toxicity on bone marrow (blood counts),
liver (alanine aminotransferase, ALT), kidney (creatinine), and
effects on glucose metabolism. Except for asymptomatic increase
of neutrophils, parameters remained within reference range after
CCF642 (Fig. 3D). Culture of 5TGM1-luc and MM1.S-luc cells in
bortezomib-containing media over 6 months increased the IC50
toward this drug but not toward CCF642 in both cell lines,
suggesting CCF642 may prove useful in the context of bortezomib
resistance and acts via a different mechanism (Fig. 4).
An active biotinylated analogue identiﬁes PDI as CCF642 target
To identify the target of CCF642, we introduced a biotin moiety
at its 4-methoxy group (Fig. 5A) expecting this was not the target
interaction site since a commercially available unsubstituted phenyl analog retained anti–multiple myeloma activity, although IC50
in MM1.S was increased from 0.25 to 1.8 mmol/L. Biotinylated
CCF642 (B-CCF642) also had higher IC50 (2.9 mmol/L), but at
6.75 mmol/L, MM1.S survival was comparable to CCF642 (<20%
at 72 hours), suggesting it may act intracellularly but enter less
well. Streptavidin immunohistochemistry conﬁrmed entry into
the cytoplasm of MM1.S (Fig. 5B). Treatment of MM1.S cells with
B-CCF642 followed by SDS-PAGE and biotin staining suggested
covalent interactions are formed with a main band at around 60
kDa (Supplementary Fig. S4). Mass spectrometry of streptavidinbead puriﬁed protein lysates from B-CCF642–treated and untreated MM1.S cells run through SDS-PAGE and cut from a correspond-

ing area of the gel (50–70 kDa) revealed protein disulﬁde isomerase A1 (PDIA1, protein disulﬁde isomerase precursor) as most
abundant protein found only after treatment. Two other PDI
family members, PDIA3 (protein disulﬁde isomerase precursor
A 3) and PDIA4 (protein disulﬁde isomerase precursor A 4), were
also only identiﬁed in treated samples (Supplementary Table S2).
Incubation of recombinant PDI with B-CCF642 with or without prior CCF642 incubation followed by SDS-PAGE and biotin
stain conﬁrmed PDI as common target (Fig. 5C). B-CCF642 also
covalently bound to recombinant PDIA3 but not to BSA used in
the animal treatment formulation for its solubility-enhancing
properties (Fig. 5C). To test whether CCF642 affects PDI function,
we performed di-E-GSSG assays, which measure PDI's reducing
capacity (17), and compared inhibition to known PDI inhibitors
PACMA 31 (22) and LOC14 (23). CCF642 at 1 mmol/L inhibited
reduction of di-E-GSSG about as much as 100 mmol/L of LOC14
or PACMA 31 (Fig. 5D). Accordingly, the anti–multiple myeloma
activity against three exemplary multiple myeloma cell lines was
most pronounced with CCF642 (Fig. 5E). These observations
raised the question of how CCF642 inhibits PDI.
CCF642–PDI binding model
Computational docking argued against covalent binding to
active site cysteine used by PACMA 31 and all other known
covalently binding PDI inhibitors (22, 24), as CCF642 could not
be approximated any closer than 5 Ångstr€
om. The amino group of
adjacent conserved functionally relevant lysine (25), with 2.8
Ångstr€
om came close enough to the carbonyl group of CCF642

to propose a covalent reaction (Fig. 5F). B-CCF642 binding
studies on PDIA1 mutants targeting both active sites were consistent with this computational hypothesis. Replacement of lysine
with glutamic acid completely blocked, whereas the NH2 side
chain containing glutamine allowed weak binding; replacement
of cysteine with serine had no effect (Fig. 4G). Deﬁnitive crystallographic binding studies are beyond the scope of this article but
clearly needed since a covalent reaction with lysine would likely
require its deprotonation and it is not known whether this occurs
during PDI's redox reactions or upon entry of CCF642 into its
enzymatic pocket. Computationally, additional non-covalent
interactions were predicted between NO2 of the nitrothiophene
moiety of CCF642 and the NH2 side chain of glutamine adjacent
to lysine (Q402 in Fig. 5F). All PDI family members pulled out
from multiple myeloma cells with B-CCF642 have NH2 side chain
containing amino acids at that site, suggesting they may be

important for PDI activity and for binding of B-CCF642. Accordingly, substitution of the NO2 group in CCF642 with COOH
reduced anti-PDI activity (Fig. 6A) and binding to PDI as assessed
by competition with B-CCF642 (Fig. 6B). To investigate whether
the NO2 group might be released from CCF642 and inhibit PDI
via S-nitrosylation, we incubated recombinant PDI with CCF642
or S-nitrosogluthathione and tested for nitrosylated PDI using the
biotin switch method (26). We found no evidence for s-nitrosylation of PDI with CCF642, whereas the positive control effectively
caused this change (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the bacterial SOS
chromotest found no evidence for genotoxicity of CCF642 up to
20 mmol/L with or without prior liver enzyme incubation (Fig.
6D), arguing against nonspeciﬁc DNA toxicity, which could occur
with NO2 release or other DNA toxic effects. The reaction between
CCF642 and CGHCK motifs of PDI family members therefore
likely leaves CCF642 intact. The putatively novel mechanism of

PDI inhibition, higher potency than known PDI inhibitors, and
favorable safety signals from NLBM, animal studies, and the
bacterial genotoxicity screen warranted pursing the mechanism
of antimyeloma action of CCF642 further.
Acute ER stress with apoptosis-inducing calcium release in
myeloma by CCF642
Treatment of myeloma cells with CCF642, PACMA 31, or
LOC14 at doses in the upper clinically achievable range leads to
accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER as documented
by dimerization of PERK via phosphorylation (3, 4) and
oligomerization of IRE-1a (27), most pronounced after
CCF642, but suggesting they may all be able to inhibit PDI
in vivo (Fig. 7A). Increase of the proapoptotic unfolded protein
response (UPR) mediator CHOP is evident within 30 minutes
for all compounds but interestingly XBP1-s, a critical transcription factor for mediating the adaptive UPR (3, 4), undergoes a
time-dependent decline that correlates with PARP cleavage,
suggesting it may be degraded by apoptotic enzymes along
with misfolded protein sensors PERK and IRE-1a (Fig. 7A). To
investigate whether XBP1 activation via unconventional splicing of its cytoplasmic mRNA by dimerized IRE-1a is intact we
performed RT-PCR (Fig. 7B). In these experiments, MM1.S cells
were used, as it was known that despite baseline ER stress,
spliced XBP1 mRNA is not detectable in them without exogenous stressors (28). CCF642 caused IRE1-a dimerization
within 15 minutes, peaking at 1 hour, and within 2 hours,
spliced XBP1 mRNA could be detected conﬁrming IRE1-a
dimers were functionally intact (Fig. 7B) and followed a similar
time course as the other main ER stress sensor, PERK (Fig. 7C).
Nuclear fractions demonstrated decrease of the transcription
factor XBP-1s within 15 minutes compromising defense against
ER stress, probably due to acute induction of apoptotic pathways by CCF642 (Fig. 7A and E). As kinetics of apoptotic
pathway induction were faster than predicted for the transcription factor CHOP, we hypothesized acute increase of misfolded
proteins might trigger apoptosis-inducing release of ER calcium
stores. Indeed, single-cell cytosolic calcium measurements in

Discussion
Here we report the discovery of a novel antimyeloma drug
candidate with inhibitory function on the only enzyme family
capable of folding disulﬁde-rich secreted proteins like antibodies
through a mechanistically unbiased screening algorithm, which
simulated key barriers to in vivo success.
Efﬁcacy of lead CCF642 in a syngeneic mouse myeloma
model (Figs. 2 and 3) comparable to fully optimized FDAapproved ﬁrst-line proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Fig. 3)
conﬁrms that an anti–multiple myeloma assay with highly
simpliﬁed modeling of liver, non-hepatic clearance, and bone
marrow (Figs. 1 and 2B) can identify promising drug candidates.
CCF642 was one of three structurally distinct compounds from a
30,335 small-molecule screening algorithm demonstrating
desired anti–multiple myeloma activity without substantial
bone marrow toxicity in this assay that we applied as lowthroughput manual screen on 225 conﬁrmed active anti–multiple myeloma small molecules. The two other compounds (Fig.
2) were less convincing during pilot in vivo experiments, but this
may in part be related to difﬁculties with their formulation
(CCF1118) or lower potency (CCF1172). The described setup
with lymphoid and myeloid growth factor secreting HS-5 bone
marrow stromal cells as niche, documented to confer resistance
not only to multiple myeloma (21, 29) but also to myeloid and
other lymphoid cells (30–32), should be applicable to a variety
of bone marrow cancers but would require adjustment for solid
tumors. Compared with reported cancer-niche screens (33),
growth in semipermeable inserts expands modeling options like
simulation of non-hepatic clearance without disruption of cell
contacts by transfer into drug-free media. Use of inserts further
enables compartmentalized NLBM growth and inclusion of liver
homogenate. Applied to chemical library compounds it will not
mimic in vivo pharmacokinetic behavior but has the potential to
enrich for agents with higher likelihood of in vivo activity by
ﬁltering for stability toward liver enzymes, ability to diffuse
(through agarose and cell layers), and suppress cancer on niche
with adjustable bolus-like or constant exposure. Our results
suggest it may further enable selection of agents without substantial adverse effects on the bone marrow (Fig. 3D). If others
conﬁrm our ﬁndings and automation is achieved, it may

PDI is a target of CCF642. A, biotinylated CCF642 (B-CCF642). B, streptavidin IHC conﬁrms entry of B-CCF642 into the cytoplasm of MM1.S cells. C, CCF642 and BCCF642 compete for binding to recombinant PDIA1, quantiﬁed by densitometry of immunoblot images normalized to background and PDI AB signals (left).
The right immunoblot panel shows no evidence for covalent B-CCF642 binding to BSA after 30-minute incubation but to PDIA3. Ponceau S stain was used
to document protein loading. D, time-dependent inhibition of di-E-GSSG reduction by PDI with CCF642 or known PDI inhibitors PACMA 31 and LOC14
normalized to spontaneous di-E-GSSG reduction. E, reduction of trypan blue–negative cells at 72 hours in three multiple myeloma cell lines by CCF642 and known PDI
inhibitors at up to 6.75 mmol/L. F, electrostatic surface representation of CCF642 docked onto PDI (Protein Data Bank ID: 4EKZ) as predicted by Autodock 4.
Energy minimization suggested covalent binding may occur to conserved lysine K401, where the carbonyl group of CCF642 is predicted to reach within 2.8 Å of its
amino group, whereas distances of 4.58 and 5.83 Å between the oxygen atoms of the NO2 group of CCF642 and the NH2 group of glutamine 402 suggest
noncovalent interaction could occur at this site. A similar situation is predicted for the other active site CGHCK motif and for other PDIs sharing this motif.
G, biotin stain and anti-His AB immunoblot after a 30-minute incubation with 5 mmol/L B-CCF642 of recombinant wild-type PDIA1 and mutants that have both active
sites (a and a0 ) mutated as indicated shows B-CCF642 binding is dependent on lysine but not on cysteine. All experimental results under this ﬁgure are
representative of at least three independent experiments. Error bars, SD.

after liver enzyme incubation. CCF642, with or without liver incubation, did not increase SOS activity over untreated control. Results are representative
of three independent experiments. Error bars, SD.

streamline cancer drug discovery by reducing unsuccessful costly
animal experiments.
Like many small molecules from diversity libraries, CCF642 has
limited aqueous solubility, creating challenges when moving
from in vitro to in vivo where higher volume of distribution
requires administration of more concentrated drug. After standard
solvents used for intravenous formulations failed to keep CCF642
in solution, we explored albumin, an abundant plasma protein
with hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Albumin is FDAapproved as carrier for paclitaxel in Abraxane and bovine as well as
human albumin has been used in mice effectively for drug
delivery (34, 35). Albumin-dissolved CCF642 could be given
intravenously without injection reactions in mice, but for ease
of administration, we chose the intraperitoneal route and saw
promising efﬁcacy without obvious toxicity. Albumin could generally be considered for clinical translation but we anticipate
medicinal chemistry optimization will enable a less expensive
formulation. Respective efforts will aim for crystallographic conﬁrmation of the putatively novel interaction with PDI (Fig. 5F and
G) to allow rational design and analog pharmacophore testing.
The thiazolidinedione-like structure of CCF642 and its ability to
increase cytosolic calcium in myeloma cells suggest special attention will need to be placed on liver, mitochondrial, and cardiac
safety in the analog selection process. Preliminary and limited
safety analyses of CCF642 in myeloma-bearing mice found no

www.aacrjournals.org

evidence for liver toxicity or ﬂuid accumulation anti-diabetic
PPAR-activating thiazolidinediones can cause, but mild decrease
of blood sugar (Fig. 3D) reinforces the need for vigilance and
suggests a possible off-target effect of CCF642 will need to be
investigated. Stable cytosolic calcium in NLBM cells after CCF642
(Fig. 7D) argues against broad nonspeciﬁc mitochondrial toxicity
but does not obviate the need for further investigation into
possible effects of optimized analogs on liver or heart. Furthermore, asymptomatic increase of neutrophils in intraperitoneal
albumin-CCF642–treated mice (Fig. 3D) suggests optimizing
formulation to avoid delayed precipitation that may have subclinically irritated peritoneal membranes and investigating possible alternate mechanisms will be important in drug development. Although the CCF642 scaffold raises outlined safety concerns, our preliminary analyses suggest it may yield an optimized
analog that satisﬁes safety mandates for clinical translation.
Success of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has established protein homeostasis as valid target in oncology, especially
for lymphoid malignancies (11, 36) but multiple myeloma
remains incurable costing estimated 11,240 lives in 2015 in the
United States (SEER). CCF642, consistent with its effect on
proteostasis by PDI inhibition (Figs. 5 and 7), had potent activity
in the submicromolar IC50 range on multiple myeloma and
lymphoma cell lines while so far limited evaluations in myeloid
neoplasia revealed more varied and less pronounced effects

Acute ER stress with apoptosis-inducing calcium release in myeloma by CCF642. A, PDI inhibitors increase PERK dimerization by phosphorylation and IRE1-a
oligomerization within 30 minutes in KMS-12-PE conﬁrming accumulation of misfolded ER proteins. Proapoptotic ER stress signaling via CHOP induction is
intact with all PDI inhibitors but XBP-1s, a transcription factor mediating adaptive ER stress responses, decreases in a temporal pattern that correlates with PARP
cleavage, suggesting breakdown along with PERK and IRE1-a. PDI staining documents comparable loading. B, immunoblots and RT-PCR of MM1.S whole
cell, nuclear, and cytoplasmic fractions show XBP1 splicing (s) of cytoplasmic unspliced (u) mRNA in response to CCF642 is intact and detectable about 1 hour after
dimerization of IRE1-a peaks. Nuclear XBP1-s protein undergoes a decline that correlates with PARP cleavage (E) in this cell line as well. C, PERK dimers in
MM1.S cells treated with CCF642 conﬁrm increase of misfolded proteins in the ER of MM1.S cells after 15 minutes. D, MM1.S and NLBM cells were loaded with
the intracellular calcium indicator Fura-2 AM, and cytoplasmic calcium concentration was continuously recorded following addition (arrow) of 3 mmol/L
CCF642 or DMSO vehicle. Each trace is average calcium concentration in 86 to 89 cells. E, immunoblots show that pretreatment of MM1.S cells with intracellular
calcium chelator BAPTA AM for 1 hour before 3 mmol/L CCF642 delayed caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. F, immunoblot of NLBM cells after CCF642 treatment
reveals minimal increase in PERK dimers and minimal caspase 3 cleavage. Results are representative of at least three independent experiments per panel.

Myeloma Control with Protein Disulﬁde Isomerase Inhibition

(Supplementary Fig. S3). The central role of PDI for ER productivity and stress reduction suggests exocrine cancers and histologies with high levels of ER stress should be tested in future studies.
Two leading PDI inhibitors have remained preclinical so far;
PACMA 31 covalently binds to active site cysteines of PDI and
has shown promise in ovarian cancer (22), whereas LOC14 was
found to have antiapoptotic function on nerve cells in a model of
Huntington disease and binds noncovalently at nanomolar concentration but requires high micromolar doses for PDI inhibition
in the insulin aggregation assay (23), which measures its reducing
potency (24). To date, no reliable method for measuring PDI
activity in cells has been described and in vitro assays used in drug
discovery poorly reproduce PDI physiology where cysteine oxidation, reduction, and isomerization of disulﬁde bonds has to be
accomplished in short sequence and is inﬂuenced by additional
enzymes, like Ero1-a (37) that restore oxidative potential of PDI
required for immunoglobulin folding (5). Therefore, current in
vitro PDI activity assays mainly establish that a drug candidate can
affect PDI function but not how effectively its versatile enzymatic
potential is impaired in vivo or how profoundly restoration by
Ero1-a is affected. We chose the most sensitive in vitro PDI activity
assay to quantify inhibition and then evaluated whether the most
upstream expected consequence of PDI inhibition occurred in
cells, sensing of misfolded ER proteins by PERK and IRE1-a.
CCF642 was more potent than known PDI inhibitors in the in
vitro assay against myeloma cells (Fig. 5) and when assessed for
ability to increase misfolded ER proteins in multiple myeloma
cells, but the latter experiments that used doses in the upper
range of generally clinically achievable (3 mmol/L) suggested that
all PDI inhibitors may reach their target in vivo (Fig. 7A). For
CCF642, the only PDI inhibitor where this dose was above the
IC50 against multiple myeloma cells and against PDI in vitro, this
was followed by acute induction of apoptosis, faster than expected
from induction of the proapoptotic ER stress mediator CHOP.
Further studies suggested that calcium release, possibly from rapid
accumulation of misfolded ER proteins, was at least partially
responsible (Fig. 7). Detailed studies on the mechanism of
calcium release by CCF642 in multiple myeloma are beyond the
scope of this article but might reveal additional targets or interference with interaction of PDI with calcium-regulating proteins
like calreticulin (38).
In summary, results suggest a straightforward assay that simulates important barriers to in vivo success of anti–multiple mye-

loma compounds can yield candidates promising for clinical
translation. While its ﬁrst lead may act through mechanisms in
addition to PDI inhibition, it is so far the most promising anti–
multiple myeloma PDI-inhibiting compound. Fully deﬁning its
interaction with PDI through crystallography may enable development of optimized speciﬁc PDI inhibitors with potentially
broader oncology application.
