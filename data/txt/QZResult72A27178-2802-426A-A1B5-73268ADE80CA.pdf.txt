Abstract
The metastatic cell population, ranging from solitary cells to
actively growing metastases, is heterogeneous and unlikely to
respond uniformly to treatment. However, quantification of
the entire experimental metastatic cell population in whole
organs is complicated by requirements of an imaging modality with the large field of view and high spatial resolution necessary to detect both single cells and metastases in the same
organ. Thus, it is difficult to assess differential responses of
these distinct metastatic populations to therapy. Here, we develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique capable
of quantifying the full population of metastatic cells in a secondary organ. B16F1 mouse melanoma cells were labeled with
micron-sized iron oxide particles (MPIO) and injected into
mouse liver via the mesenteric vein. Livers were removed immediately or at day 9 or 11, following doxorubicin or vehicle
control treatment, and imaged using a 3T clinical magnetic
resonance scanner and custom-built gradient coil. Both
metastases (>200 μm) and MPIO-labeled single cells were
detected and quantified from MR images as areas of hyperintensity or hypointensity (signal voids), respectively. We found
that 1 mg/kg doxorubicin treatment inhibited metastasis
growth (n = 11 per group; P = 0.02, t test) but did not decrease
the solitary metastatic cell population in the same livers (P >
0.05). Thus, the technique presented here is capable of quickly
quantifying the majority of the metastatic cell population, including both growing metastases and solitary cells, in whole liver by
MRI and can identify differential responses of growing metastases and solitary cells to therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(21):8326–31]

Introduction
Successful treatment of metastatic disease remains a significant
clinical challenge, with treatment failure often attributed to tumor
inaccessibility, advanced stage of the disease upon detection, poor
drug delivery, or drug resistance (1–3). However, experimental metastasis models have revealed that the population of metastatic
cells within a secondary organ is heterogeneous and unlikely to respond uniformly to treatment (4–8). This situation was shown by
Naumov and colleagues who showed that doxorubicin was able to
inhibit growth of large vascularized metastases but had no effect

on the number or viability of solitary dormant cells present in the
same organs or their ability to subsequently form metastases (5).
Ultimate treatment failure in patients therefore may also be the
result of failure to target the entire population of metastatic cells,
particularly solitary dormant cells. However, experimental studies
of solitary dormant metastatic cells and development of treatments to target them are complicated by the difficulties associated
with detecting and quantifying single cells in vivo.
Several imaging modalities have been used to study metastasis.
The advantages and limitations of these modalities, including
positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed
tomography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR),
ultrasound, and bioluminescent and fluorescent optical imaging,
are well documented (9–14). To date, the majority of studies focusing specifically on solitary metastatic cells have relied on fluorescent optical imaging due primarily to the high-resolution
capabilities of this modality. In fact, the dormant metastatic cell
population has been defined by optical characteristics including retention of exogenous fluorescent markers that are diluted and no
longer visible following a few cycles of replication (5, 7, 8, 15). However, although fluorescent optical imaging has been used most frequently and provides the most detailed resolution for the study of
single cells in vivo, the restricted field of view and depth of penetration often limit attempts to quantify solitary metastatic cells as well
as growing metastases distributed throughout an entire organ or animal. In addition, this method can be destructive to the tissue and
samples only a small subset of the organ.
Advances in cellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have
provided a powerful imaging modality by which single cells can
be detected and quantified noninvasively on a scale ranging from
small tissue samples to whole animals (9, 16–19). Heyn and colleagues showed that solitary cells, including cancer cells, could be detected in mouse brain by MRI when labeled with iron oxide
particles (MPIO; refs. 16, 18). These cells appear in MR images as
signal voids (areas of image hypointensity; that is, black) due to the
susceptibility effect and increased local relaxivity caused by the
iron oxide particles with which the cells are labeled (17, 18). Using
the same three-dimensional fast imaging employing steady-state
acquisition pulse sequenced used here, it has also been shown that,
as MPIO-labeled cells begin to proliferate, the areas of hypointensity are lost due to dilution of label with cell division (18). Metastases that subsequently form in the same location are visible in
images as areas of hyperintensity (that is, white) without additional contrast agent (18). Labeling MDA-MB-231BR breast cancer cells
with MPIO was shown previously to have no effect on the growth
of the cells in vitro or their subsequent ability to form brain metastases in mice (18). Comparison of MR images and histologic
sections confirmed that signal voids in MR images corresponded

MRI Analysis of Liver Metastasis

Figure 1. Signal void area strongly
correlates with the number of MPIO-labeled
B16F1 cells in the liver. A strong correlation
(R2 = 0.96; P < 0.001) exists between
the number of cells injected and the total
signal void area detected in whole mouse
livers (A). This correlation covers the
range from 3.75 × 104 to 1.5 × 105 cells.
For the entire range between 0 and
3 × 105 cells, the R2 correlation is 0.83
(P < 0.001; inset). B, MPIO-labeled
B16F1 cells are apparent in MR images
as multiple signal voids (dark spots;
e.g., arrows) in a background of normal
liver tissue that appears gray (e.g.,
arrowhead). An increase in the number
and size of signal voids is apparent in
the representative MR images of an
increasing number of cells (3.75 × 104,
7.5 × 104, 1.5 × 105, and 3.0 × 105).

with sections in the brain where fluorescent MPIO-labeled cancer
cells were present (18). In addition, Shapiro and colleagues showed
that individual MPIO-labeled hepatocytes could be detected in liver following migration from the spleen (17). However, the utility of
cellular MRI techniques for quantifying the effect of a cancer treatment on the entire metastatic cell population in whole organs has
not yet been shown.
Here, we describe a MRI method by which the majority of the
metastatic population of B16F1 melanoma cells in mouse liver, including both solitary cells and growing metastases, can be rapidly
(<6 min scan per liver) quantified in intact livers while preserving
the tissue for further analysis. This novel method of quantification
was then used to determine the effect of doxorubicin on both solitary
cells and growing metastases. It was found that doxorubicin significantly decreased total metastatic tumor volume but failed to reduce
the number of solitary dormant metastatic cells in the same livers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and MPIO labeling. Cell culture and MPIO labeling procedures were similar to those described previously (8, 18). Briefly, B16F1
murine melanoma cells were maintained in α-MEM containing 10% fetal
bovine serum at 37°C and 5% CO2. For MPIO labeling, cells were grown in a
T75 tissue culture flask using medium with fetal bovine serum until 80% to
90% confluent. MPIO beads (312.5 μL supplied stock suspension, 0.9 μm
diameter, 63% magnetite, labeled with Dragon Green; Bangs Laboratory)
were then added to 10 mL medium with fetal bovine serum per flask
and incubated for 24 h. The cells were washed thoroughly with serum-free
α-MEM to remove unincorporated MPIO beads. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in serum-free α-MEM at the appropriate concentration for injection. Nearly all cells were efficiently labeled with MPIO, and
labeling did not inhibit cell growth in vitro or the ability of cells to form
metastases in vivo (data not shown) as reported previously (18).
Experimental metastasis assay and doxorubicin treatment. Female,
6- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice (Harlan) were cared for in accordance with

the Canadian Council on Animal Care under a protocol approved by the
University of Western Ontario Council on Animal Care. For experimental
metastasis assays, mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of xylazine/
ketamine (2.6 mg ketamine and 0.13 mg xylazine per 20 g body mass).
Anesthetized mice received mesenteric vein injections of 100 μL B16F1
cells suspended in α-MEM to target cells directly to liver as described
(8). It has been shown previously that the majority of cells injected via this
route are trapped in the liver by size restriction in liver sinusoids, with
∼90% of injected cells retained in the liver 90 min after injection (8). To
quantify how signal void volume varies with the number of cells in the liver
(proportional to the number of cells injected), mice (3-4 per group; total n = 14)
were injected with 3.75 × 104, 7.5 × 104, 1.5 × 105, or 3.0 × 105 cells per mouse
(in 100 μL) and sacrificed 10 to 15 min following cell injection. For tumor
burden and treatment experiments, 3 × 105 B16F1 cells (in 100 μL) were injected. Livers to be scanned and correlated with MR images were removed at
day 11. Treatment with doxorubicin (Pharmacia) at 1 mg/kg, or vehicle control (0.9% sodium chloride), commenced 24 h following cell injection and
continued three times weekly for a total of four treatments. Mice (n = 11 control and n = 11 treated) were sacrificed 9 days following cell injection and
livers were removed and fixed in formalin for at least 48 h.
MRI and image analysis. Mice were sacrificed and livers removed immediately (10-15 min) or at 9 days (doxorubicin experiment) or 11 days (histology correlation) following cell injection. Formalin-fixed livers were
scanned using a 3T clinical MRI. All MRI examinations were done on a 3T
GE CV/i whole-body clinical magnetic resonance scanner as described previously (18). In brief, this included a custom-built gradient coil (inner diameter 12 cm, maximum gradient strength 600 mT/m, and peak slew rate 2,000
T/m/s) and solenoidal radiofrequency coil (inner diameter 1.5 cm). Images
were obtained using the three-dimensional fast imaging employing steadystate acquisition pulse sequence (20). The scanned resolution was 100 ×
100 × 200 μm3 and the total acquisition time was <6 min per whole liver.
No additional contrast agent (other than MPIO in cells) was used in these
studies. This single-cell MRI approach thus differs from most other contrast
agent approaches in the liver (primarily gadolinium-based agents), which are
intended to improve detection of metastases, whereas our approach is
intended to permit detection of solitary cells before commencement of
proliferation.

Figure 2. MR image hyperintensity corresponds with metastatic tissue in histologic sections. Hyperintense regions (white arrows) in MR images (A and B, top)
correlate with regions of B16F1 metastatic tumors (black arrows) in H&E-stained histologic sections (A and B, bottom). B16F1 metastases as small as 200 μm
were apparent in MR images (C, top) and corresponded with small metastases visible in histologic sections (C, bottom). Two-dimensional MR images (A-C, top),
which sample the entire liver, can be used to render representative three-dimensional images in which tumor is apparent (pseudocolored green; D, top).
Three-dimensional rendering of liver closely resembles the picture of the scanned liver lobe (D, bottom).

Tumor and liver volume analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction of
images were completed using VGStudio Max (Volume Graphics) or OsiriX
imaging software (open source). This process is semiautomated as hyperintense areas of images were automatically thresholded and subsequent
manual correction of misclassified regions (such as vasculature) was done.
Signal void area was measured using ImageJ image analysis software
(NIH). For each group of mice, a pixel value threshold was established
manually and subsequent analysis for all scans within each experiment
was automatically calculated using the fixed-pixel intensity threshold. At
least 125 images per organ were used to calculate signal void area.
Histology and statistics. Digital images of whole formalin-fixed livers
were acquired using a 7.1 MP digital camera (Canon) mounted to a tripod.
These were used for comparison of visible surface tumors with surfacerendered MRI images of hyperintense regions. For histologic correlation,
livers were paraffin-embedded, sectioned (4 μm), and stained with H&E.
Statistical analysis of tumor volume and signal void area following
doxorubicin treatment was done using a t test comparing volume and
area (respectively) from at least 125 MR images per liver. Data are presented
as mean ± SE. A standard curve and R2 value were generated by linear regression and used to quantify the correlation between signal void area and the
number of solitary cells present in the liver. All statistical analyses were
done using GraphPad Prism software.

with the number of cells injected into the liver. The coefficient of
determination (R2) value between signal void area and cell number
over the entire range of cells injected from 0 to 300,000 was
0.83 (P < 0.001; Fig. 1A, inset). However, within the range between

MRI signal void area strongly correlates with the number of
MPIO-labeled cells. To determine if MRI signal void area could be
used to quantify the number of cells present in the liver, we assessed the correlation between signal void area and the number
of B16F1 cells labeled with MPIO in that organ (Fig. 1). Varying
numbers (3 × 105, 1.5 × 105, 7.5 × 104, or 3.75 × 104) of B16F1 cells
labeled with MPIO were delivered to mouse liver via mesenteric
vein injection. Livers were removed immediately following injections, fixed in formalin, and scanned by 3T MRI as described in
Materials and Methods. As seen in Fig. 1B, it is readily apparent
that both the number and area of signal voids (arrows) increases

MRI Analysis of Liver Metastasis

Figure 4. Doxorubicin inhibited growth of metastases
but did not decrease the number of dormant cells as
measured by signal void area. Whole livers, showing black
melanotic tumors visible at the liver surface (A), were
scanned by MRI producing multiple two-dimensional
images (representative images, B) sampling the entire liver.
Two-dimensional images were combined to render
three-dimensional volumetric images of the originally
scanned livers (C). A decrease in surface tumor is visible
as a decrease in black or green false coloring in A and
C, respectively. Decreased area of hyperintensity (tumor
tissue) was apparent in two-dimensional MR images (B) of
doxorubicin-treated mice. Quantification of signal void area
from two-dimensional images and metastatic tumor volume
from three-dimensional images showed that doxorubicin
treatment resulted in a significant decrease in tumor
volume (n = 11 per treatment group; P = 0.02, t test; D).
However, doxorubicin treatment did not decrease the
number of dormant cells in the same livers (P = 0.2, t test)
as quantified by MR signal void area at endpoint (D).

3.75 × 104 and 1.5 × 105 cells, R2 increased to 0.96 (P < 0.001; Fig. 1A).
A decrease of 3.75 × 104 cells (between 3.75 × 104 and 7.5 × 104
cells), representing only 12.5% of number of cells initially injected,
was found to be significantly different (P = 0.0019, t test) within a
population of only 8 mice. The high degree of correlation between
the number of MPIO-labeled cells and signal void area (cell number explaining up to 96% of the variance in signal void area) indicates that quantification of this MR image parameter is a useful
measure of the number of cells and ultimately quantification of
the effect of treatment on this population of cells.
Quantification of B16F1 liver metastases (hyperintensity)
in MR images. To assess the utility of the 6 min whole-liver
3T MRI scan for quantification of liver metastasis volume,
unlabeled B16F1 cells were injected into liver via mesenteric vein.
Livers were removed at day 11 following injection and imaged by
MR as described above. As seen in Fig. 2A and B, tumor tissue
in histologic images (bottom), from which tumor burden, area, or
size have traditionally been quantified, is readily apparent as areas
of hyperintensity in corresponding MR images (top). Tumor tissue
hyperintensity from metastases as small as 200 μm in diameter, by
histology, were also visible in MR images (Fig. 2C). The appearance
of tumor tissue as hyperintense regions in the liver is consistent

www.aacrjournals.org

with previous publications using T2-weighted images (21–23).
Tumor hyperintensity can be used to calculate multiple tumor
parameters, including volume, and can also be used to segment
the tissue into multiple regions of interest that can be used to render
three-dimensional images. Three-dimensional images rendered
using semiautomated segmentation based on tumor tissue hyperintensity closely resemble whole scanned liver lobes as can be seen by
the surface tumor pattern (Fig. 2D).
Metastases and solitary dormant cells are apparent in the
same MR image. To determine the feasibility of quantifying both
solitary cells and growing metastases from the same MR images,
livers injected with MPIO-labeled B16F1 cells were removed and
imaged at day 9. Whole intact livers (Fig. 3A) were scanned by
MRI as described above. This resulted in two-dimensional images
(Fig. 3B) in which both signal voids (arrow) from MPIO-labeled
B16F1 cells and hyperintense areas (arrowheads) from metastases
could be seen in the same image. The two-dimensional images
were then used to render a three-dimensional image (Fig. 3C;
Supplementary Video S1) of the whole liver with surface tumor
patterns similar to those of the intact whole liver (Fig. 3A). As
the entire liver volume is scanned, MR images can be used to
quantify size, number, and total tumor and normal tissue volume

information from the whole liver (Fig. 3). All metastases in the
organ can be assessed in contrast to the limited number of representative sections that are routinely assessed with histology
(Fig. 3D). In addition, this rapid MRI scanning procedure is nondestructive, so tissue is preserved for further analysis following the
scans.
Doxorubicin decreased metastatic tumor volume but not
signal void area. To assess the ability of the MRI technique described here to quantify the effect of doxorubicin on both growing
metastases and the solitary dormant metastatic cell population in
whole mouse liver, 3 × 105 B16F1 cells labeled with MPIO were injected into the liver via the mesenteric vein. Mice were treated
with 1 mg/kg doxorubicin, or vehicle control, three times weekly
(four total treatments). Livers were removed 9 days after cell injection, fixed, and scanned by MRI as above. Doxorubicin treatment
resulted in an obvious decrease in surface tumor area in wholeliver images (Fig. 4A), three-dimensional MR image rendering,
and two-dimensional MR image tumor area (hyperintensity;
Fig. 4B and C). Analysis of MR images showed that doxorubicin
treatment resulted in a significant decrease in metastatic tumor
volume (n = 11 per group; P = 0.02, t test; Fig. 4D, left). However,
doxorubicin treatment did not decrease the number of solitary
cells in the same livers (P = 0.2, t test) as quantified by MR signal
void area at endpoint (Fig. 4D, right). The mean signal void area
from all livers at endpoint (434 ± 29 mm2) corresponds with 6.5
× 104 ± 5.8 × 103 cells (Fig. 1A). MR images were also analyzed to
determine the total number of metastases, liver volume, total liver
and tumor volume, and average metastasis volume for all
livers (Supplementary Fig. S1). The results of this experiment
thus show the utility of this rapid MRI technique in simultaneously
assessing the effect of treatment on solitary tumor cells and
metastases and show that doxorubicin has a differential effect
on metastases and solitary tumor cells, inhibiting metastatic
growth but not affecting the number of solitary tumor cells in
the same livers.

Discussion
Here, we present a novel MRI method that allows rapid quantification of the majority of the metastatic cell population, including
both solitary cells and growing metastases, in a whole organ from a
single scan while preserving the tissue for further analysis. Using
this technique, we showed that doxorubicin treatment significantly
inhibited B16F1 metastatic tumor growth but had no effect on the
number of solitary dormant metastatic cells present in the same
livers. Several studies have shown that a larger proportion of metastatic cells may remain as solitary dormant cells compared with
those that grow to form large vascularized metastases (4, 7, 8,
24–26). However, although the single-cell population may be clinically important and at least in part responsible for delayed recurrences, this population of cells remains poorly understood (5, 27).
The MRI quantification method outlined here allows for rapid
assessment of drug efficacy on a much greater proportion of
the metastatic cell population, inclusive of both metastases and
solitary dormant cells, compared with other currently available
methods of quantification.
Multiple MRI-based techniques are currently used to detect
and quantify iron oxide–labeled cells (19). These include detection of iron-labeled hepatocytes, macrophages, dendritic, cancer,
and stem cells using T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted imaging
techniques and quantification using multiple MRI parameters

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (21). November 1, 2009

including T2, R2, and R2* (20, 28–35). It has been established
qualitatively that the number of MPIO-labeled human breast
cancer cells delivered to the brain is associated with the number
of MRI signal voids (18). In addition, it has been shown that the
spatial arrangement of signal voids found in MR images of the
brain and liver corresponded with cellular fluorescence from
MPIO-labeled cells in these tissues (17, 18). Signal voids present
in the brain and liver 28 or 30 days following injection, respectively, were previously verified to be due to the originally injected
cells, which had been dual-labeled with both fluorescent dyes
and superparagmagnetic iron (17, 18). In contrast, experiments
in which killed MPIO-labeled cells or free MPIO were injected
into the spleen or liver resulted in signal void patterns and
intensity of signal loss that differed substantially from those
observed in mice injected with viable MPIO-labeled cells (17).
In the day 9 MR images of livers from the doxorubicin treatment
experiment in the present study, some smaller less hypointense
areas of signal void were also observed. It is likely that at least
some of these signal voids in which hypointensity peaks are
not as pronounced may be due to MPIO that is no longer
concentrated in the originally injected solitary cells. However,
as the signal void area is quantified here based on a set threshold value, the difference in the intensity of signal loss can
be used to exclude these areas of weak signal loss from the
endpoint quantification. Further, based on the magnitude of
signal void loss shown here at endpoint, less than one-third of
the originally injected cell population remained. This is consistent with past experiments with the B16F1 cell line in which
cell fate was assessed by optical techniques (8). Taken together,
our current results, as well those published previously (17, 18),
thus suggest that the signal voids quantified here represent ironretaining cancer cells.
Due to signal void “blooming” (MRI signal void appearing much
larger than the actual MPIO-labeled cells) and the proximity of
cells to one another, a single MRI signal void is not always due
to a single cell (16, 36). This appears to be observable in Fig. 1
where the size and number of signal voids increase with cell number. As may be expected (see Fig. 1, inset), at higher cell numbers,
some signal voids will overlap, resulting in a nonlinear relationship
between signal void area and numbers of cells injected. However,
here we show that there is a strong correlation (R2 values = 0.830.96) between signal void area in MR images and the number of
metastatic cells present in the liver, indicating that signal void area
is proportional to numbers of single cells present. This correlation
is especially high (R2 = 0.96) in the range between 3.75 × 104 and
1.5 × 105 cells (12.5-50% of cells initially injected). This is important
as results from experimental metastasis models in which solitary
cell fate has been quantified have shown that this is the range
within which the number of solitary dormant metastatic cells
would most commonly be expected to fall (5, 7, 8). Consistent with
this, we found that total signal void area from MPIO-labeled B16F1
cells at day 9 accounted for a much smaller (∼6.5 × 104), however
still significant, proportion of the 3 × 105 cells initially injected.
Our finding that doxorubicin treatment inhibited metastasis
growth but did not decrease the number of solitary MPIO-labeled
B16F1 cells (Fig. 4) is in agreement with results of a previous experiment in which mouse mammary carcinoma cells were quantified by fluorescent optical imaging (5). That study also showed that
doxorubicin inhibited metastatic burden while not affecting the
numbers of single cells present. Although the full significance of
the dormant metastatic cell population remains to be understood,

it is likely that exclusion of this population of metastatic cells
from analysis of treatment efficacy plays a role in treatment failure
leading to recurrence (5, 15, 27, 37–40). A growing number of
metastasis models have shown that solitary dormant metastatic
cells retain their capacity to proliferate, forming late-growing
metastases or primary tumors following isolation and reinjection
(4, 7, 8, 16, 24–26). The quantification method we present here
advances the study of treatment effect on metastatic cells, as it
is currently the only method we are aware of that possesses the
capability to detect, localize, and quantify the majority of the
metastatic cell population in whole organs without destroying
the tissue and while preserving a three-dimensional digital record.
Currently, only a small proportion of the metastatic cell population
is sampled to determine the effect of treatment in most studies.
Taking into consideration the heterogeneous nature of the metastatic cell population, it may not be possible to develop treatments
capable of fully eliminating metastatic disease until the effect

method that we present here represents an opportunity to assess
the effect of treatment on a significant population of metastatic
cells that may be responsible for often significant failure rates in
treatment of metastatic disease.
