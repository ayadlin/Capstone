Abstract

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

Human cancers, including breast cancers, are comprised of clones differing in mutation content.
Clones evolve dynamically in space and time following principles of Darwinian evolution1,2,
underpinning important emergent features such as drug resistance and metastasis3–7. Human
breast cancer xenoengraftment is used as a means of capturing and studying tumour biology, and
breast tumour xenografts are generally assumed to be reasonable models of the originating
tumours8–10. However the consequences and reproducibility of engraftment and propagation on
the genomic clonal architecture of tumours has not been systematically examined at single cell
resolution. Here we show by both deep genome and single cell sequencing methods, the clonal
dynamics of initial engraftment and subsequent serial propagation of primary and metastatic
human breast cancers in immunodeficient mice. In all 15 cases examined, clonal selection on
engraftment was observed in both primary and metastatic breast tumours, varying in degree from
extreme selective engraftment of minor (<5% of starting population) clones to moderate,
polyclonal engraftment. Furthermore, ongoing clonal dynamics during serial passaging is a feature
of tumours experiencing modest initial selection. Through single cell sequencing, we show that
major mutation clusters estimated from tumour population sequencing relate predictably to the
most abundant clonal genotypes, even in clonally complex and rapidly evolving cases. Finally, we
show that similar clonal expansion patterns can emerge in independent grafts of the same starting
tumour population, indicating that genomic aberrations can be reproducible determinants of
evolutionary trajectories. Our results show that measurement of genomically defined clonal
population dynamics will be highly informative for functional studies utilizing patient-derived
breast cancer xenoengraftment.

To evaluate xenograft clonal dynamics (see Table S1 for definitions of terms used) we
generated 30 xenograft lines by serially transplanting (up to 16 generations over 3 years)
breast cancer tissue organoid suspensions from 55 patients (Table S2, Extended Figure E1,
Figure S1) into highly immunodeficient NOD/SCID/IL2rγ−/− (NSG) and NOD/
RAG1−/−IL2rγ−/− (NRG) mice11 (details in the Supplementary Information). We carried out
massively parallel whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGSS) on DNA from xenograft
passages of 15 patient lines (10 primary tumour-derived and five pleural effusion-derived),
along with matched patient tumour and normal DNA (47 samples total, median sequencing
depth 45.1,Table S3). For these plus 56 additional xenograft passage samples, we validated
3187 somatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) positions (100–300 per tumour-xenograft

series) and 132 structural variant (SV) positions by deep targeted amplicon sequencing
(Table S4, Table S5, Table S6), quantifying allele ratios to high precision. We surveyed the
copy number alteration (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) landscapes by Affymetrix
SNP6.0 array (Table S7, Table S8). The mutation load of somatic SNVs (range: 4.3–
27.7×103 genome-wide, 57-1040 in coding regions), CNA and LOH (34–67% of genome)
and SVs in the 15 tumour-xenograft series (Figure S2, Table S9, Figure S3) were consistent
with previous genome-wide breast cancer studies4, 12–17, though low tumour cellularity
hindered mutation discovery in SA429 and SA496 originating tumours. Tumour-xenograft
pairs displayed comparable nucleotide substitution patterns (Figure S2, Figure S4),
suggesting mutational processes are maintained post-engraftment.

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

To determine the extent of evolution in the SNV landscape, we first compared the genomewide variant allele prevalences (VAP, the proportion of aligned reads at the SNV position
with the variant base, see Table S1) from WGSS data in xenograft relative to tumour (SA429
and SA496 excluded due to low tumour cellularity). As expected, sizeable proportions
(range 53.0–92.9%) of high-confidence SNVs are shared in tumour-xenograft pairs, with
prevalences lying on a scatter plot diagonal indicating neutral dynamics (Extended Figure
E2a, Figure S5a, Figure S6). Strikingly, all 15 samples also show clusters of SNVs prevalent
in the xenograft while at or below the limit of detection in the tumour (range 6.5–32.1% of
SNVs, see e.g. SA494, SA495, SA499), and vice versa (range 0.2–19.4%, see e.g. SA494,
SA495, SA500), implying clonal selection on initial engraftment. Tumours and xenografts
from SA494, SA495, SA499, SA500 and SA530 also exhibited substantial differences in SV
content (Figure S7, Figure S3).

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

To resolve clonal dynamics and genotypes, we applied a Bayesian clustering model
(PyClone4, 18) to SNV VAPs measured by targeted deep sequencing, accounting for the
effect of copy number, LOH status and cellularity. SNVs with co-varying estimates of
cellular prevalence (the proportion of tumour or xenograft cells bearing the mutation) across
all time points are grouped into putative mutation clusters (Table S1). Consistent with the
raw VAP measurements, several cases contained mutation clusters with high (75–100%)
prevalences in the xenografts and low (0–15%) prevalences in the tumours, implying
expansion of initially minor clones to dominate the xenograft (e.g. clusters 3, 4, 3, 2, 8, 2,
and 2 in SA494, SA495, SA500, SA530, SA532, SA533, and SA535) (Extended Figure
E2b, Figure S5b). Other series (SA493, SA499, SA501, SA531, SA534, SA536)
demonstrated non-neutral clonal dynamics but involving alleles occupying much smaller
proportions of total cellular populations. Interestingly, polyclonal population structure
specific to the xenograft was observed after initial expansion in SA493, SA494, SA495,
SA500, and SA531, suggesting initial selection on engraftment remains permissive to
additional clonal evolution (Extended Figure E2b, Figure S5b). Polyclonal engraftment was
evident in SA493, SA501, SA531 and SA532, suggesting multiple clones maintained their
fitness post-engraftment.
Analogously, we analyzed clonal dynamics using CNAs as clonal marks, applying a
probabilistic model (TITAN19) that infers CNA and LOH from WGSS data, accounting for
mixtures of tumour and normal cells and reporting estimates of mutation cellular prevalence
and mutation cluster membership (Table S10). Despite conservation of complex disruptions,

such as chromothripsis in SA429 (Figure S8) and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles in SA429
and SA494 (Figure S9,Figure S10), we identified substantial differences in copy number
architecture between tumour and xenograft in all cases (Extended Figure E2c, Figure S5c).
These included a xenograft-specific deletion event containing TP53 (in SA500) that
coincided with retention of a somatic SNV (Figure S11, Table S6). Notably, the predominant
clonal dynamic (minor subclone expansion in SA494, SA495, SA532 and SA533;
polyclonal engraftment in SA493, SA501) mirrored those seen in SNV space.

We next asked how clonal dynamics differ after initial engraftment, using PyClone
predictions over serial passage generations spanning up to 3 years (Extended Figure E1). We
distinguished statistically significant directional clonal dynamics by testing overlap of 90%
credible intervals derived from Bayesian posterior probability distributions (Figure 1). Cases
showing strongest clonal dynamics in the first engraftment passages (e.g. SA500, SA530,
SA494, SA535) exhibited more stable prevalence over subsequent passages. In contrast,
cases showing moderate initial clonal dynamics showed more dramatic subsequent dynamics
(e.g. mutation clusters 2, 3 and 8 of SA501), in some cases leading to gradual expansion of a
minor clone to dominate the xenograft over serial passages. We noted examples of all ER/
HER2 subtypes and primary/metastatic cancers evolving by these two different modes.
Some mutation clusters showed non-dynamic patterns over time (e.g. clusters 1, 4, 6 of
SA500, clusters 1–3, 5, 7, 9–10 in SA532, as well as the highest prevalence clusters
representing putative ancestral mutations that remained invariant, as expected). For two
cases we noted preferential engraftment of initial transplants in MFP over SR site (SA496
4/4 MFP vs 0/4 SR; SA429 2/4 MFP vs 0/4 SR, Extended Figure E1). However, transplant
site changes in established xenografts were not associated with unusually strong clonal
dynamics (Figure 1, see SA495 X3-4, SA499 X3-4, SA429 X1-2, SA496 X1-2).
To directly validate the population-based inference of mutation clusters and clonal
genotypes, we carried out single cell analyses of cases SA494 (an example of extreme initial
selection) and SA501 (complex post-engraftment clonal dynamics). We performed
multiplexed targeted re-sequencing of SNVs in 210 isolated tumour and xenograft nuclei,
using microfluidic devices. We determined evolutionary relationships between nuclei by
Bayesian phylogenetic inference20, deriving consensus genotypes for clades representing
high probability splits in the phylogenetic tree.

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

As predicted by PyClone, two major clades emerge in the SA494 phylogeny, comprising
tumour and xenograft nuclei respectively, bearing mutually-exclusive sets of alleles in
additional to a set of shared alleles (Extended Figure E3a, b, c, Figure S13). The ancestral
clone SNVs (PyClone cluster 1) are common to nuclei from both clades, while SNVs in the
predicted dominant tumour clone (cluster 2) and minor engrafting clone (cluster 3) are
restricted to tumour and xenograft nuclei respectively (Extended Figure E3d, Genotypes A
and B). This confirms the ancestral relationship between tumour and xenograft, verifies the
expansion of a very minor clone (<5%) while showing unambiguously that mutation clusters
inferred by PyClone represent major clonal genotypes.
PyClone analysis of SA501 (Figure 2 and Figure S12) revealed a dynamic and complex
clonal architecture, with gradual expansion of minor mutation clusters observed over

consecutive passages, and expansion followed by decline of other clusters (Figure 2c). The
major mutation clusters and their gradual change in prevalence over time predicted by
PyClone were confirmed by the clonal genotypes of single cells from SA501 passages X1,
X2 and X4 (Figure 2b, Figure S13). Phylogenetic inference resolved the clonal genotypes of
five major clades (Figure 2a, d), with cascading acquisition of mutations from parental to
descendent clone (Figure 2e). Genotypes A and B belong to sibling clades defined by the
addition of cluster 5 and cluster 4 mutations, respectively, to the ancestral genotype defined
by clusters 1 and 8; Genotype C was derived from Genotype B with the addition of
mutations in cluster 7; Genotype D derived from Genotype C with the addition of mutations
defined by cluster 2; and Genotype E from Genotype D with the addition of cluster 3
mutations and loss of cluster 8 mutations (Figure 2a, d, e). The clonal dynamics measured in
the population was reflected in the relative abundance of single cell genotypes in each
xenograft tumour (Figure 2f), mirroring bulk population predictions (Figure 2c). Both X1
and X2 sampled nuclei show an admixture of clones defined by genotypes A, B, C, and D
(relatively rare in X1). Genotype E is confined exclusively to X4 nuclei, suggesting that by
passage 4, this clone had nearly exhaustively outcompeted its ancestor and sibling clones. Its
eventual dominance is mirrored by the decline of Genotype A (initially present in X1 and
X2), suggesting the descendants of Genotype B outcompeted those of Genotype A over
time.
Taken together, these single cell genotyping experiments combined with phylogenetic
inference have recapitulated population level PyClone predictions in a simple (SA494) and a
complex (SA501) clonal expansion model. Thus, single cell genotyping validates PyClone
mutation clusters as genomic markers of major clonal genotypes, while providing additional
insight into the ancestral lineages of cell populations.

Finally, to determine whether directional clonal dynamics might be associated with
deterministic as opposed to stochastic processes (such as random genetic drift), we tested
whether similar clonal dynamics occurred when the same tumour population was multiply
transplanted into different mice. In 4/5 series examined, parallel clonal dynamics of the
same mutation cluster(s) were observed (arrows in Figure 3a, b and Extended Figure E4a, b:
SA501 2/2 replicate mice at passage X3 and 4/4 at X4; SA535 X1 3/3; SA532 X1 3/3, X2
3/7 and X3 2/2; SA429 X2 3/5). These include reproducible expansions of initially minor
subclones, implying a high likelihood of shared deterministic mechanism rather than
repeated rare stochastic events (for example, arising from transplants close to limiting
dilution). In SA501 the same pattern (expansion of cluster 3 mutations mirrored by decline
of cluster 5 mutations) was independently observed in transplants at passage 2, 3 and 4
(Figure 3a, 2B, 3B, 4A–D), suggesting shared clonal fitness but variable timing. We also
observed instances of divergence, for example expansion of SA532 cluster 4 specific to
branch 2A-3A-4A-5A (Extended Figure E4a). SA535 (Figure 3b) and SA532 showed
examples of clonal expansion patterns replicated in related but different immunodeficient
mouse strains (NSG, NRG). To control against shared clonal structure imposed through joint
inference of the datasets, we also carried out independent PyClone analyses that excluded all
but one transplant at each passage, and observed high correlations of inferred mutation
prevalences between same-passage replicates (Extended Figure E5; median Pearson
correlations 0.94, 0.93, 0.91, 0.91, 0.46 for SA501, SA535, SA532, SA429, SA496). These

data indicate that clonal genotypes defined by somatic aberrations (and/or closely cosegregating genomic factors) can be biologically meaningful determinants of fitness, leading
to consistent and reproducible clonal dynamics.

PMC Canada Author Manuscript

We show here that patient derived xenograft clonal dynamics on initial transplant vary from
polyclonal engraftment with only moderate clonal selection, in which tumour and xenograft
clonal prevalence are broadly similar (a minority of cases), to highly skewed dynamics in
which initially minor prevalence clones expand to dominate the xenograft (the majority of
cases). Expansion of minor subclones has been suggested in previous xenotransplantation
studies using malignant epithelial10, 21–23 or hematopoietic24, 25 cells, without formal
resolution of the clonal genotypes or pattern of subsequent clonal dynamics. In contrast with
preliminary studies of xenoengraftment, we find correlated dynamics of clones defined by
SNVs or copy number aberrations as clonal marks. Expansion patterns are most often
pronounced in the initial establishment passage, however in cases where initial clonal
selection is weak, subsequent evolution over passaging is more evident. Furthermore,
polyclonal sub-structure may emerge even in xenografts that have undergone a modest
population bottleneck on initial engraftment. These dynamic processes are not evident from
histopathological or imaging characteristics, which remain broadly stable, consistent with
previous reports8, 9, 23.
Importantly, we find that the population dynamics of genomically-defined clones are
replicated when transplants are carried out in multiple mice, implying that the basis of
selection is non-random and likely closely linked to the particular mutation genotype (or
epigenotype) that defines the clone. The most parsimonious explanation for repeated
observation of these clonal dynamics is that the clones are mostly pre-existing and variations
in clonal fitness explain the dynamic behaviour, as opposed to de-novo somatic mutation.
Furthermore, cases in which conversion from minor to dominant clone occurs monotonically
over multiple passages demonstrate that selective fitness can be persistent rather than
transient. Thus, specific somatic genotypes are likely to act as genetic markers of clonal
growth and fitness advantages, yielding predictable and reproducible clonal dynamics.
Determination of the precise aberrations that give rise to selective clonal fitness still faces
considerable challenges. In this regard, we believe that ascertainment of clonal dynamics
will prove essential for fully informed future studies of drug response and tumour biology in
xenografts of human breast cancers.

Figure 1.

Clonal dynamics over multiple passages in time. Plots display the mean cellular prevalence
estimates of mutation clusters in originating tumours (T) and subsequent xenograft passages
(X1, X2, etc.). The clusters and prevalences were inferred by PyClone from population
targeted deep sequencing. Line widths indicate the number of SNVs comprising each
mutation cluster (numbers in brackets adjacent to each plot). Black lines indicate non-neutral
dynamics, assessed by non-overlap of credible intervals derived from Bayesian posterior
distributions (solid=non-neutral over indicated passage, dotted=over cumulative passages
since initial transplant). All passages that underwent deep sequencing are shown. Transplant
sites are represented by colour (blue=subcutaneous, red=subrenal, green=mammary fat pad),
tumour and passages analyzed by WGSS are underlined. The panels are ordered by the
degree of initial change in mutation cellular prevalence. Singleton clusters were not
displayed for clarity.

Single cell determination of clonal genotypes recapitulates population-based prediction of
cascading subclonal evolution. DNA was prepared from 90 individual SA501 xenograft
nuclei from passages X1, X2 and X4, and the variant allele ratios were determined by
targeted ultra-deep sequencing at 45 somatic SNV and 10 germline SNV positions. a,
Bayesian phylogenetic tree derived from multi-locus genotypes of individual nuclei,
depicting cascading evolution. b, Heatmap depicting multilocus variant allele ratios (blue/
yellow/red corresponds to wild-type/heterozygous/homozygous loci). Nuclei (y-axis) are
ordered according to the phylogenetic tree in (a). Positions (x-axis) are grouped according to
the consensus genotypes derived from high-probability branch splits in a manner naive to the
PyClone clustering. The cluster groupings (horizontal bar below horizontal axis) recapitulate
the PyClone groupings inferred from bulk population measurements (c). d, Five consensus
genotypes derived from high-probability splits in the phylogenetic tree. e, Schematic of the
phylogeny derived from single cell genotyping depicts the sequential expansion of genomic
subclones. Genotypes are coloured according to the last Py-Clone mutation cluster acquired
at a given point in the phylogeny. f, Schematic representations of xenograft tumours X1, X2,

and X4 based on single cell genotypes. Cells are coloured according to their genotype in (e),
and the number of cells within each schematic corresponds to the number of sequenced
nuclei with the given genotype in (b). The relative proportions of cells with each genotype
reflect predictions based on bulk measurements in (c).

Clonal dynamics are reproduced in replicate transplants (1). a, b, Upper panels: Passaging
history of SA501, SA535 showing transplants that resulted in successful xenografts. The
host mouse strains (blue=NSG, orange=NRG) are indicated. All transplants were in
subcutaneous site. Lower panels: change in cellular prevalence of mutation clusters over
individual transplants. Plots correspond to passages in upper panels. The clusters are inferred
by PyClone using grouped data from all passages, and correspond to those displayed in
Figure 1. Arrows show examples of parallel clonal dynamics of the same mutation cluster in
multiple replicate transplants.
