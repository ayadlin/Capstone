Abstract
Tumor cells often use developmental processes to progress toward advanced disease. The E-box
transcription factor TWIST1 is essential to epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration
in the developing neural crest. In melanoma, which derives from the neural crest cell lineage, enhanced
TWIST1 expression has been linked to worse clinical prognosis. However, mechanisms underlying TWIST1
expression and whether aberrant TWIST1 levels promote steps in melanoma progression remain unknown.
Here, we report that elevated TWIST1 mRNA/protein expression is dependent on extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling, which is hyperactive in the majority of melanomas. We show that
TWIST1 protein levels are especially high in melanoma cell lines generated from invasive, premetastatic stage
tumors. Furthermore, TWIST1 expression is required and sufﬁcient to promote invasion through Matrigel
and spheroid outgrowth in three-dimensional dermal-mimetic conditions. Alterations to spheroid outgrowth
were not as a result of altered cell death, cell-cycle proﬁle, or paradigm EMT protein changes. Importantly, we
identify matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) as a novel downstream target of TWIST1. We have determined
that TWIST1 acts, in a dose-dependent manner, as a mediator between hyperactive ERK1/2 signaling and
regulation of MMP-1 transcription. Together, these studies mechanistically show a previously unrecognized
interplay between ERK1/2, TWIST1, and MMP-1 that is likely signiﬁcant in the progression of melanoma
toward metastasis. Cancer Res; 72(24); 6382–92. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The process of invasion allows tumor cells to traverse the
boundaries of the basement membrane and move through the
ECM to intravasate and ultimately colonize distant sites (1).
Often, tumor cells will use core developmental processes to
progress toward advanced or metastatic disease. One such
process is the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT
prompts morphologic and cytoskeletal changes in precursor
cells that allow for the migratory reorganization of embryonic
germ layers and is required for mesoderm formation during
gastrulation (2). EMT or EMT-like processes are thought to be a
critical step in the metastatic cascade by regulating motility
and/or invasion, resistance to anoikis, and stem cell-like
properties (3).

One important EMT regulator during development is the
basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor, TWIST1 (2–5). It
was originally discovered as a gene crucial for proper
gastrulation and mesoderm formation in Drosophila (4). In
mammals, TWIST1 expression during a precise time frame
in embryogenesis allows for the migration and differentiation of several mesodermal and neural crest cell lineages (5,
6). Many of the phenotypes attributed to TWIST1 occur as a
result of its binding to E-box consensus sites in gene
promoters, ultimately leading to transcriptional activation
or repression (4, 7).
TWIST1 is overexpressed in many primary tumors including
colon, breast, prostate, and gastric carcinomas (8–11). In
agreement with its role in embryonic cell migration, TWIST1
overexpression has been linked to increased tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (7, 11–13). These actions of
TWIST1 have been correlated with changes in classical EMT
targets such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin (7, 11, 12); however,
the extent to which TWIST1 regulates non-EMT targets is not
fully understood.
Recently, TWIST1 was found to be highly upregulated in the
vast majority of melanoma tumors and cell lines, and was
correlative to worse patient survival (8, 14). Melanoma is an
aggressive skin cancer that arises from neural crest–derived
melanocytes (15, 16). Invasion plays a critical role in melanoma
progression. If cells are mainly conﬁned to expansion within
the epidermis (radial growth phase, RGP), melanoma is easily
cured through surgical intervention (15, 16). If undiagnosed

ERK1/2–TWIST1–MMP-1 Invasion Axis in Melanoma

and properties of invasion begin to emerge, cells escape the
basement membrane and expand through the deeper dermal
layers. This conversion to vertical growth phase (VGP) is the
direct precursor to metastasis (15). The depth of melanoma
invasion and tumor thickness are used as predictors of poor
clinical prognosis (17, 18); however, the mechanisms underlying melanoma invasion from the epidermis into the dermis
remain poorly characterized. Upregulation of the RAS-RAFMAP–ERK kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK)1/2 signaling pathway may be critically important in this
process. Hyperactivation of this pathway is common in multiple cancer types but especially in melanoma, where mutations in N-RAS (15%–20%) or B-RAF (40%–60%) are prevalent
(15, 16, 19). In addition, mutant B-RAF, especially B-RAFV600E, is
required for enhanced growth and invasion of melanoma cells
(20). Many of the factors inﬂuencing increased melanoma
invasion downstream of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 are unknown.
As TWIST1 plays important roles in the developing and
highly migratory neural crest, and as tumor cells often aberrantly regulate developmental pathways, we sought to determine
the role of TWIST1 in melanoma invasive growth. In this study,
we have found that TWIST1 promotes invasion in 3-dimensional (3D) dermal-mimetic assays and reveal an ERK1/2TWIST1-matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1) pathway that
likely will have a major impact on invasion and metastasis.

Results
TWIST1 is upregulated in melanoma cell lines,
particularly in VGP, downstream of oncogenic B-RAF
and is positively regulated by active ERK1/2 signaling
We explored the TWIST1 expression proﬁle across an
extensive panel of melanoma cell lines representing various
tumor stages and genotypes. Our results show that TWIST1
protein is upregulated in all melanoma cell lines tested compared with neonatal human epidermal melanocytes
(NHEM; Fig. 1A). Furthermore, TWIST1 protein is especially
high in invasive VGP tumors compared with RGP and metastatic tumors of similar genotype, which may denote a selective
requirement of TWIST1 in early steps of metastasis.
Interestingly, protein expression of TWIST1 in mutant BRAF melanoma cell lines is elevated compared with similar
stage wild-type B-RAF cell lines and correlates relatively well
with the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we found that siRNA-mediated depletion of either
mutant B-RAF or mutant and wild-type B-RAF greatly reduced
TWIST1 protein levels in WM793 (B-RAFV600E) and WM115 (BRAFV600D) cells (Fig. 1B). To eliminate the possibility of offtarget effects, a rescue experiment was conducted in which
inducible B-RAF knockdown cells were engineered to express
a GFP control or to reexpress a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)resistant form of B-RAFV600E. Upon rescue of B-RAFV600E
expression, with concomitant reestablishment of phosphorylated ERK1/2, TWIST1 protein levels were restored (Fig. 1C).
This was further conﬁrmed by the inhibition of RAF signaling
by PLX4720 (a nonclinical analog of PLX4032/vemuraﬁnib),
and by the inhibition of active ERK1/2 signaling by the MEK
inhibitor, U0126 (Fig. 1D).
To extend our studies further, we used 2 independent
metastatic melanoma samples surgically resected from
patients. Both tumors were genotyped: tumor #1 harbors
wild-type N-RAS and wild-type B-RAF, whereas tumor #2
harbors wild-type N-RAS and B-RAFV600E (data not shown).
After short-term culture and transient MEK inhibition, both
tumor samples evidenced downregulation of TWIST1 protein
concurrent with reduction in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 1E).
Individual knockdown of ERK1 and ERK2 in mutant B-RAF
cell lines revealed that both isoforms contribute to regulation of
TWIST1 (Fig. 1F). The amount of TWIST1 ablation correlated
closely with the total amount of phosphorylated ERK1/2 remaining after knockdown. Despite links with the ERK1/2 pathway, inhibition of ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK; ref. 22) or STAT3
(23) did not result in TWIST1 protein changes (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and S1B). In addition, AKT does not seem to contribute
to TWIST1 regulation (Supplementary Fig. S1C; ref. 13). Thus,
the molecule(s) that acts as a bridge between ERK1/2 and
TWIST1 still remains elusive and requires future analysis.
TWIST1 regulation by active ERK1/2 signaling occurs at the
transcript level, as TWIST1 mRNA is downregulated upon
treatment with PLX4720 or PLX4032 and is further conﬁrmed
by the use of U0126 ( , P < 0.05,  , P < 0.01; Fig. 1G). In addition,
while TWIST1 stability may be regulated posttranslationally in
other cell types (24), the combination of cycloheximide and
U0126 did not hasten TWIST1 protein degradation in mutant
B-RAF melanoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Therefore,

PLX4720 (1 mmol/L) or U0126 (10 mmol/L) for 24 hours. E, metastatic melanoma tumor #1 and #2 were placed in short-term culture after surgical resection and

WM115 cells and WM793 cells were transfected with control siRNA, ERK1 siRNA, and/or ERK2 siRNA. After 72 hours, lysates were harvested and Western
blots conducted. G, quantitative RT-PCR was done from WM793 and 1205Lu cells (treated with 1 mmol/L PLX4720, 24 hours), from WM115, WM9, and A375
cells (treated with 1 mmol/L PLX4032, 24 hours), and from WM793 cells treated with U0126 (10 mmol/L, 24 hours). Columns, average of 3 independent

we conclude that TWIST1 mRNA is positively regulated downstream of mutant B-RAF via activation of ERK1/2 signaling.
TWIST1 is required and sufﬁcient for melanoma cell
invasion through Matrigel
The role of TWIST1 expression in the biology of advanced
melanoma cells is currently unknown. Oncogenic RAF-MEKERK signaling has been shown to be critical for the invasive
capabilities of melanoma cells (20, 25, 26). In addition, studies
in breast cancer have implicated TWIST1 in the early invasive

steps of the metastatic cascade (7). To assess the role of the
ERK target, TWIST1, in the ability of melanoma cells to invade
in a Matrigel transwell assay, we used the VGP cell lines WM793
and WM115. Reduced expression of TWIST1 protein via 3 independent shRNAs in WM793 and WM115 cells signiﬁcantly
reduced the invasive capacity of those cells by 40% to 50%
( , P < 0.01; Fig. 2A and B). Conversely, we overexpressed
TWIST1 in poorly invasive, RGP cell lines that displayed low
endogenous TWIST1 expression. TWIST1 overexpression in
Sbcl2 and WM3211 cells signiﬁcantly increased the ability of

Figure 2. TWIST1 is required and sufﬁcient for melanoma cell invasion through Matrigel. WM793 (A) and WM115 (B) cells constitutively expressing control or 1
of 3 independent TWIST1 shRNAs were used. Cells were allowed to invade through Matrigel-coated chambers toward an attractant of full serum media.
Counts taken (in triplicate ﬁelds of view) from the control shRNA (average set at 100% invasion) were used to calculate percent invasion for all other treatments.

cells to invade through Matrigel by approximately 40% and
30%, respectively ( , P < 0.01; Fig. 2C and D).
High TWIST1 expression promotes melanoma spheroid
outgrowth
Many melanoma cell lines have the ability to aggregate into
spheroids when grown in nonadherent conditions. In comparison to individual cells, these spheroids more closely represent melanoma tumor architecture. The ability of melanoma
cells to expand outward from an initial spheroid into surrounding 3D collagen, mimicking the in vivo collagen-rich dermal
layer, is a mark of invasive capacity (27, 28). As differences in
gene expression proﬁles and phenotypic outcomes can arise
between cells grown in 2-dimensional versus 3D culture (29,
30), we sought to determine whether high TWIST1 expression
is sufﬁcient for invasion in 3D dermal-mimetic conditions. The
WM793 cell line is invasive and displays robust spheroid

outgrowth in this context (27). Therefore, WM793 spheroids
constitutively expressing control or 1 of 3 TWIST1 shRNAs
were implanted into 3D collagen and monitored for several
days. Strikingly, WM793 cells depleted for TWIST1 displayed
signiﬁcant defects in the ability to begin and sustain spheroid
outgrowth compared with control cells ( , P < 0.01; Fig. 3A). To
determine whether TWIST1 expression in a RGP cell line would
promote outgrowth, WM35 cells constitutively overexpressing
either LacZ or TWIST1 were analyzed. Indeed, signiﬁcant
increases in the spheroid outgrowth of WM35 cells that
constitutively overexpress TWIST1 were observed ( , P <
0.01; Fig. 3B).
Spheroid outgrowth may be affected by changes in cell death
and/or cell-cycle progression. Previous studies showed a
TWIST1 involvement in the p53/p21Cip1 pathway, and that
reduction of TWIST1 results in increased G1 arrest and senescence (8, 31). Therefore, we examined the effect of TWIST1

AM and ethidium bromide to visualize live and dead cells,
respectively. No qualitative differences were apparent between
any of the spheroids with altered TWIST1 and their control
counterparts (Fig. 3C and D, Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly,
at 96 hours, embedded spheroids were subjected to an EdU
incorporation assay to evaluate potential differences in Sphase proﬁle. We also analyzed the S-phase proﬁle of adherent

differences were found between control and TWIST1-altered

conclude that the TWIST1-regulated differences in spheroid
outgrowth do not result from alterations in cell death or the
ability of cells to enter S-phase.
TWIST1 regulates MMP-1 expression in melanoma cell

ERK1/2–TWIST1–MMP-1 Invasion Axis in Melanoma

EMT include loss of cell–cell adhesions and cell polarity
through the suppression of epithelial markers (i.e., E-cadherin)
and simultaneous acquisition of mesenchymal protein expression (i.e., N-cadherin, b-catenin, Vimentin). Interestingly, the
melanoma cell lines used in our studies with altered TWIST1
expression did not display changes in their morphology (data
not shown) or EMT protein expression (Supplementary Fig.
S3). As a result, an alternative target(s) that is independent of
classical EMT must exist in melanoma cells that functions to
mediate the effect of TWIST1 expression on altered invasion
patterns.
MMPs are key players in the ability of cancer cells to
proteolytically degrade the basement membrane and ECM to
invade and metastasize. We, therefore, examined whether
TWIST1 might alter the expression of MMPs. Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis of several MMPs implicated in melanoma
progression was done (data not shown). MMP-1 (collagenase1) was chosen for further analysis as it showed considerable
upregulation at the mRNA level after TWIST1 overexpression
( , P < 0.01, Fig. 4A and C). MMP-1 is capable of degrading
several types of collagen, which is a major component of the
dermis in vivo and in the synthetic extracellular matrices used
in our in vitro invasion studies in Figs. 2 and 3 (32, 33). In
addition, MMP-1 has a well-established role in promoting
melanoma cell invasion and metastasis (see Discussion).
In WM793TR cells, TWIST1 shRNA #3, targeting the 30
untranslated region of TWIST1, elicited a signiﬁcant decrease
in MMP-1 mRNA and secreted protein ( , P < 0.01; Fig. 4A).
Importantly, reexpression of ectopic (and shRNA-resistant)
TWIST1 rescued levels of MMP-1 mRNA and secreted protein
in these cells ( , P < 0.01; Fig. 4A). Therefore, the effect of
TWIST1 on MMP-1 expression is speciﬁc and cannot be
explained by off-target effects. In addition, overexpression of
TWIST1 in the noninvasive cell line Sbcl2 resulted in a more
modest but signiﬁcant increase in MMP-1 mRNA and protein
( , P < 0.05; Fig. 4B).
Previous studies found that MMP-1 is regulated downstream of the active RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway in melanoma (34, 35). We hypothesized that TWIST1 may be a link
between activated ERK1/2 and MMP-1 upregulation. Therefore, we assessed the ability for overexpressed TWIST1 to
compensate for the loss of active ERK1/2 signaling after
treatment with the MEK inhibitor, U0126. Similar to Fig. 4A,
TWIST1 overexpression can rescue decreased MMP-1 mRNA
and protein expression caused by ERK1/2 pathway inhibition
( , P < 0.05,  , P < 0.01; Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results
show that TWIST1 is a positive regulator of MMP-1 and is a
mediator of ERK1/2 signaling to MMP-1 in melanoma.
TWIST1 alters MMP-1 promoter activity in a dosedependent manner and directly binds the MMP-1
promoter
TWIST1 is a transcription factor capable of directly binding
E-box consensus sites (50 -CANNTG-30 ) to exert transcriptional
effects (4, 7). Direct human target genes of TWIST1 remain
poorly deﬁned. Their identiﬁcation is especially intriguing in
melanoma given our ﬁnding that TWIST1 alteration does not
affect EMT genes as it does in other cancer types (7, 11). Several

reporter assays in wild-type B-RAF 293FT cells and Sbcl2 cells.

assay was done to determine whether the MMP-1 promoter activity would change as a result of increasing TWIST1 expression in 293FT cells. Fold change was
calculated by dividing the normalized luciferase activities of TWIST1-expressing 293FT cells by the normalized luciferase activity of LacZ-expressing
cells. A Western blot analysis conﬁrmed differential expression of TWIST1 and LacZ. Columns, average of 3 independent experiments; bars, SD;  , P < 0.05. C,

D, in parental WM793 cells, ChIP followed by quantitative PCR was conducted to determine if TWIST1 binds directly to the MMP-1 promoter. V5
epitope immunoprecipitation was conducted as a negative control for enrichment. Columns, average of 6 independent experiments; bars, SD;  , P < 0.05,

, P < 0.01. E, a biotinylated oligonucleotide pulldown assay was conducted with whole cell protein lysates from parental WM793 cells. A pulldown
without oligonucleotide was conducted as a negative control. Following the pulldown, Western blot analyses were conducted to determine TWIST1
enrichment relative to 10% input. F, oligonucleotide pulldowns were repeated for MMP-1 E-box #5 without nonlabeled competitor or in the presence of
5-, 10-, and 20-fold excess of nonlabeled E-box #5 competitor. Also, a biotinylated mutant E-box #5 oligonucleotide (4 mutant nucleotides) was used to
determine the speciﬁcity of the interaction.

Corresponding to the MMP-1 mRNA/protein expression
changes downstream of TWIST1, we found that TWIST1 overexpression increases MMP-1 promoter activity in a dosedependent manner ( , P < 0.05,  , P < 0.01; Fig. 5B and C).
To determine whether TWIST1 was able to bind directly to
the MMP-1 promoter, we conducted ChIP of endogenous
TWIST1 in parental WM793 cells followed by quantitative
PCR of 4 MMP-1 promoter regions (Fig. 5A). Immunoprecipitation of a V5 epitope, which is not present in parental WM793
cells, was used as a negative control. As expected, TWIST1
immunoprecipitation was unable to signiﬁcantly enrich the
b-actin locus compared with control (data not shown). Notably, all 4 MMP-1 promoter regions were signiﬁcantly enriched by TWIST1 immunoprecipitation ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;
Fig. 5D).
To further conﬁrm direct binding of TWIST1 to E-boxes in
the MMP-1 promoter, we conducted a biotinylated oligonucleotide pulldown assay. In this assay, each of 8 E-boxes in the

6388

Cancer Res; 72(24) December 15, 2012

MMP-1 promoter was assessed individually for their ability to
pulldown TWIST1 protein (Fig. 5A). A reaction without biotinylated oligonucleotide was used as a negative control. Several
sites were strong in their ability to enrich TWIST1 protein
compared with other sites, especially E-box #5 (Fig. 5E).
TWIST1 binding to E-box #5 was reduced through the addition
of increasing amounts of nonlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (Fig. 5F). The binding of TWIST1 to this site was also
ablated by the mutation of 4 key residues within E-box #5.
These results indicate that TWIST1 not only regulates MMP-1
promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner but also
TWIST1 directly binds to regulatory regions in the MMP-1
promoter.

ERK1/2–TWIST1–MMP-1 Invasion Axis in Melanoma

degradation abilities, invasion in vitro, and metastasis in vivo
(33, 36–39). We sought to determine whether forced expression
of MMP-1 could rescue defects in melanoma spheroid outgrowth resulting from TWIST1 ablation.
For these studies, we used WM793TR cells that inducibly
express either control shRNA or TWIST1 shRNA #3. We then
engineered each of these cell lines to overexpress either a LacZ
control or MMP-1 protein upon doxycycline addition (Fig. 6A).
WM793TR spheroids, generated in the presence or absence of
doxycycline, were implanted into 3D collagen and doxycycline
treatments maintained. WM793TR spheroids that were grown
in the absence of doxycycline displayed spheroid growth
typical of a VGP cell line with no signiﬁcant differences
apparent between the variants (Fig. 6B and C, left; Supplementary Fig. S4). The induction of TWIST1 shRNA #3 þ LacZ
in WM793TR cells caused signiﬁcant defects in spheroid
outgrowth at all time points examined, as was previously
established in Fig. 3 ( , P < 0.05,  , P < 0.01; Fig. 6B and C,
right; Supplementary Fig. S4). Importantly, WM793TRTWIST1 shRNA #3 cells engineered with a rescue of
MMP-1 expression showed a signiﬁcant increase in spheroid
outgrowth area as compared with those cells with TWIST1
depletion alone ( , P < 0.001). From these studies, we can
gather that MMP-1 is a major effector used by TWIST1 to
alter invasion in melanoma.

Discussion
Our results provide evidence that active ERK1/2 signaling
promotes upregulation of TWIST1, which in turn positively
regulates the known invasion protein, MMP-1 (Fig. 7). Mutations that lead to hyperactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEKERK1/2 pathway occur in 30% of all malignancies and are
considered in many contexts to be early initiators of neoplasia (40). Melanoma is an optimal model system to study
the downstream effects of hyperactive ERK1/2 signaling, as
it occurs in approximately 90% of these patients and leads to
evasion of apoptosis and increased tumor growth and invasion (19). The mechanisms stemming from constitutively
active ERK1/2 signaling leading to increased tumor invasion
have yet to be fully established. In this study, we present
clear evidence that RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling positively regulates TWIST1. Through pharmacologic inhibition,
siRNA/shRNA ablation, and protein rescue experiments, we
show that active ERK1/2 signaling tightly controls TWIST1
protein expression through alterations in transcript levels in
mutant B-RAF cells. These data are consistent with microarray data previously published by Shields and colleagues
(41). We have also found changes in TWIST1 in 4 mutant NRAS melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5); however
because of variability in the timing of downregulation and
effects on transcript levels (data not shown), we have not
further examined the mechanism in this subgroup. Thus, we
cannot rule out ERK1/2 dependent, posttranscriptional regulation of TWIST1 in these cells.
Melanoma is also a model for the invasive process, as the
highly metastatic nature of this tumor type leads to chemotherapy resistance and its classiﬁcation as the deadliest
form of skin cancer. Aberrant invasion is one of the main

resulting from TWIST1 ablation. A, WM793TR cells were engineered to
express either control shRNA or TWIST1 shRNA #3 as well as a
LacZ gene cassette or a MMP-1 gene cassette upon doxycycline
addition. Cells were left untreated (basal TWIST1 and MMP-1 expression)
or induced with doxycycline for 96 hours before spheroid formation.
After treatment, lysates were harvested and Western blot analyses
were conducted. In addition, induction was conducted for the ﬁnal 24
hours in serum-free media for detection of secreted MMP-1. B,
WM793TR cells described above (þ/ doxycycline) were allowed to form
spheroids that were then implanted into 3D collagen. Bright ﬁeld
images were taken at 24-hour increments with careful consideration to
image the same spheroids at each time point. Percent outgrowth
was calculated by comparing the surface area of the spheroid

Figure 7. Working model of an ERK1/2–TWIST1–MMP-1 cascade in
melanoma. In our model, active ERK1/2 signaling leads to increased
TWIST1 transcription. The factors responsible for TWIST1 regulation
downstream of ERK1/2 require further investigation. Through our studies,
we ﬁnd that TWIST1 is able to alter the invasive capability of melanoma
cells in multiple systems. While TWIST1 is likely to regulate multiple
factors that impact invasion, we establish MMP-1 as a novel downstream
effector of TWIST1. We show that accumulated TWIST1 protein is able to
bind the MMP-1 promoter and lead to increased transcription and
secreted MMP-1 protein. It is well established that upon secretion of proMMP-1 and its cleavage into an active form, MMP-1 promotes cancer cell
invasion associated with its ability to degrade collagen in the ECM and
activate protease activated receptor 1.

processes by which cancer cells evade tissue boundaries to
achieve colonization at metastatic sites. To that end, many
cancer cells will exploit developmental mechanisms of
motility and migration. The TWIST1 protein has been well
studied in development as a main molecule responsible for
cell migration from the neural crest during embryogenesis
through EMT mechanisms. Before this study, TWIST1 was
known to be upregulated in melanoma and associated with
poor prognosis (8, 14); however, the mechanism and role of
elevated TWIST1 expression in melanoma has remained
unexplored. Here, we report that TWIST1 positively regulates melanoma cell invasion. The promotion of invasion by
TWIST1 was observed in 2 3D invasion assays, 1 representing invasion through a basement membrane and the other
mimicking the dermal microenvironment following invasion
through the basement membrane. Despite previous reports

6390

Cancer Res; 72(24) December 15, 2012

of TWIST1 interaction with the p53 pathway (8, 31), cellcycle or cell death changes were not involved in the invasion
phenotypes that we observed.
Interestingly, TWIST1 expression seems to be the highest
in VGP melanoma cell lines, which are derived from tumors
that have invaded vertically into the dermis and can eventually lead to metastasis. Within our mutant B-RAF cell line
panel, all metastatic melanoma cells overexpress TWIST1
compared with melanocytes, but have reduced expression
compared with mutant B-RAF VGP cell lines. This ﬁnding
seems to contrast with previous studies where TWIST1
immunohistochemical staining was more prominent in metastatic melanoma tissue cores compared with primary melanomas (14). One potential explanation for this disparity is
that the tissues in the microarray used in this study were not
separated by genotype. In our cell line panel, TWIST1 was
more highly expressed in mutant B-RAF cell lines in comparison to similar stage wild-type B-RAF cell lines. In the
absence of organization by genotype, the prominence of
TWIST1 expression in mutant B-RAF VGP tumors might
have been obscured. In support of our data, previous work by
Weinberg and colleagues describes the requirement for
TWIST1 in early metastatic steps of invasion and intravasation and not in later steps (7). For these studies, they used 4
cell lines derived from the same tumor with differing metastatic potential and found that TWIST1 RNA/protein
expression is higher in the cell lines that can only invade
and intravasate, which is in agreement with our data. We
hypothesize that once melanoma invasion and intravasation
is accomplished, the selective pressure for TWIST1 expression is removed and therefore maintenance of high TWIST1
expression is no longer necessary.
We further provide a mechanistic basis for the effects of
TWIST1 on melanoma invasion. Surprisingly, TWIST1 did
not alter EMT-associated proteins as has been well documented in other cancer types (7, 11, 12). Instead, we provide
considerable evidence that TWIST1 positively regulates
MMP-1 mRNA leading to substantial changes in secreted
protein levels. Through luciferase reporter assays, ChIP, and
in vitro oligonucleotide pulldown assays, TWIST1 regulation
of MMP-1 was found to be dose dependent and likely occurs
through direct contact at multiple E-box sites within the
MMP-1 proximal promoter. The expression of various MMPs
has been linked to tumor invasion in a number of systems
through matrix-degrading activities (33, 38). Speciﬁcally,
MMP-1 (collagenase-1) plays a vital and substantial role in
melanoma cell invasion most likely as a result of the collagen-rich dermal environment surrounding these cells (33).
Melanoma cells that are invasive express much higher levels
of MMP-1 in comparison to noninvasive melanomas (36).
Furthermore, depletion of MMP-1 expression in invasive
melanoma cells results in decreased invasion through chambers coated with type I collagen, type IV collagen, or Matrigel
(33, 39). Also, forced expression of MMP-1 in RGP melanoma
cells increased collagen degradation in vitro, and tumor
growth and metastasis in vivo (39). We show that cells
depleted of TWIST1, but with forced MMP-1 expression,
display a restored ability to invade into 3D collagen. These

ERK1/2–TWIST1–MMP-1 Invasion Axis in Melanoma

effects are likely ECM protein speciﬁc, as changes in TWIST1
expression signiﬁcantly alters the ability of melanoma cells
to invade through and migrate toward collagen type 1 in
Boyden chamber assays, but does not signiﬁcantly affect
migration toward other ECM components such as ﬁbronectin and gelatin (Supplementary Fig. S6). Therefore, MMP-1 is
likely to be a major mechanism that TWIST1 uses to increase
invasion of melanoma cells through the collagen-rich dermis. Of note, TWIST1 was recently found to be critical in the
formation of invadopodia, which degrade the ECM through
protease action, in mammary tumor models (42). In light of
our studies, it is intriguing to postulate that TWIST1 might
increase both the formation and activity of invadopodia
through upregulation of MMP-1.
MMP-1 was recently highlighted as target of RAS-RAFMEK-ERK1/2 signaling in melanoma (34, 35). Here, we
uncover a novel mediator of this signaling with evidence
of an ERK1/2–TWIST1–MMP-1 signaling axis. B-RAF mutations are common in preneoplastic nevi and, therefore, are
considered by many to represent an initiation step in
melanoma progression (43). While the majority of common
melanocytic nevi harbor mutant B-RAF, only 23% of those
display phosphorylated ERK1/2. However, 54% of B-RAF–
mutant atypical nevi, which are those that represent an
increased risk of developing into melanoma, have active
ERK1/2 (44). One mechanism atypical nevi may use to
progress into melanoma might be through removal of negative checks in the ERK1/2 pathway leading to upregulation
of TWIST1 and subsequent increases in MMP-1. Indeed in
the clinic, melanoma patients with higher MMP-1 serum
levels had signiﬁcantly shorter time to progression as compared with those patients with lower MMP-1 serum levels
(45). MMP inhibitors failed in clinical trials for melanoma
and other cancers largely because of the enrollment of
patients with extremely advanced disease (46). Because of

the limited availability of treatment options for metastatic
melanoma patients, it might be of value to explore the use of
MMP-1 inhibitors as prophylactics in the premetastatic
stages of melanoma disease.
