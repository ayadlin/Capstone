ABSTRACT
Purpose: To determine the frequency of driver mutations in Chinese non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
Methods: Comprehensive mutational analysis was performed in 1356 lung
adenocarcinoma, 503 squamous cell carcinoma, 57 adenosquamous lung carcinoma,
19 large cell carcinoma and 8 sarcomatoid carcinoma. The effect of EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma patients after disease
recurrence was investigated.
Results: Mutations in EGFR kinase domain, HER2 kinase domain, KRAS,
BRAF, ALK, ROS1 and RET were mutually exclusive. In lung adenocarcinoma cases
“pan-negative” for the seven above-mentioned driver mutations, we also detected
two oncogenic EGFR extracellular domain mutations (A289D and R324L), two HER2
extracellular and transmembrane domain mutations (S310Y and V659E), one ARAF
S214C mutation and two CD74-NRG1 fusions. Six (1.2%) FGFR3 activating mutations
were identified in lung squamous cell carcinoma (five S249C and one R248C). There
were three (15.8%) EGFR mutations and four (21.1%) KRAS mutations in large cell
carcinoma. Three (37.5%) KRAS mutations were detected in sarcomatoid carcinoma.
In EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma patients who experienced disease recurrence,
treatment with EGFR TKIs was an independent predictor of better overall survival
(HR = 0.299, 95% CI: 0.172–0.519, P < 0.001).
Conclusion: We determined the frequency of driver mutations in a large series
of Chinese NSCLC patients. EGFR TKIs might improve the survival outcomes of EGFRmutated lung adenocarcinoma patients who experienced disease recurrence.

disease to be classified into clinically relevant molecular
subgroups. Large phase III randomized clinical trials have
proved the efficacy of targeted therapies over conventional
cytotoxic chemotherapy for NSCLC patients harboring
EGFR mutations [3–6] or ALK fusions [7]. In this study,
we presented our sequencing results of a comprehensive

panel of oncogenic driver mutations in a large prospective
series of NSCLC patients who received surgical resection.

Fifty-seven adenosquamous lung carcinoma resected
between October 2007 to January 2013 were analyzed for
mutations in EGFR kinase domain, HER2 kinase domain,
KRAS, BRAF, ALK, RET and AKT1. There were 20 (35.1%)
EGFR mutations, 6 (10.5%) KRAS mutations, 1 (1.8%)
HER2 mutation, 4 (7.0%) ALK fusions, 2 (3.5%) RET
fusions and 2 (3.5%) AKT1 E17K mutations (Figure 2B).
We also sequenced 19 large cell carcinoma samples
resected from November 2007 to May 2012 to detect
mutations in EGFR kinase domain, HER2 kinase domain,
KRAS, BRAF, ALK, RET and AKT1. There were 3 (15.8%)
EGFR mutations and 4 (21.1%) KRAS mutations
(Figure 2C).
Eight sarcomatoid carcinoma were analyzed for
the presence of EGFR kinase domain mutations, KRAS
mutations, HER2 kinase domain mutations, BRAF
mutations, ALK fusions, RET fusions and AKT1 mutations.
Three (37.5%) KRAS mutations were detected, including
2 G12C and 1 G12V (Figure 2D).

RESULTS
Frequency of oncogenic driver mutations in
NSCLC histologic subtypes
A total of 1356 lung adenocarcinoma cases from
April 2007 to May 2013 were sequenced for EGFR
kinase domain mutations, KRAS mutations, HER2 kinase
domain mutations, BRAF mutations, ALK fusions, ROS1
fusions, RET fusions and AKT1 mutations. There were 855
(63.1%) EGFR kinase domain mutations (including 361
exon 19 deletions, 402 L858R and 92 other mutations),
108 (8.0%) KRAS mutations, 32 (2.4%) HER2 kinase
domain mutations (all were exon 20 insertion mutations),
18 (1.3%) BRAF mutations (5 V600E and 13 non-V600E
mutations), 70 (5.2%) ALK fusions, 11 (0.8%) ROS1
fusions and 17 (1.3%) RET fusions (Figure 1A). All the
seven above-mentioned oncogenic driver mutations
were mutually exclusive. We also identified 2 (0.1%)
AKT1 mutations, both were E17K mutations. One patient
with AKT1 E17K mutation also harbored BRAF V600E
mutation; the other did not harbor any of the seven
above-mentioned mutations. The identification of FGFR
fusions has been reported in our previous study [8]. Six
FGFR3-TACC3 fusions were detected out of 1016 lung
adenocarcinomas, accounting for a mutation rate of 0.6%.
In cases “pan-negative” for mutations in EGFR,
HER2, KRAS, BRAF, ALK, ROS1 and RET, we also
sequenced for activating mutations in EGFR extracellular
domain (ECD), HER2 ECD and transmembrane domain,
ERBB3, ARAF and NRG1 (a total of 183 cases for ERBB
family genes, and 219 cases for ARAF and NRG1)
(Figure 1B). Oncogenic EGFR ECD mutations were
detected in two cases (1.1%): one was A289D, and the other
was R324L. One S310Y mutation and one V659E mutation
was detected in HER2 extracellular and transmembrane
domain (1.1%), respectively. There was one (0.5%) ARAF
S214C mutation. Two (0.9%) CD74-NRG1 fusions were
detected. No ERBB3 activating mutations were detected.
In lung squamous cell carcinoma, the mutation
rate of EGFR (12 out of 310, 3.9%), KRAS (8 out of
310, 2.6%), HER2 (1 out of 310, 0.3%), BRAF (1 out
of 310, 0.3%), ALK (2 out of 310, 0.6%), DDR2 (1 out
of 310, 0.3%), AKT1 (1 out of 310, 0.3%), FGFR1
fusions (2 out of 312, 0.6%) and FGFR3 fusions (9 out
of 312, 2.9%) has been reported in our previous studies
[8, 9]. We sequenced 503 lung squamous cell carcinoma
resected from October 2007 to March 2013 for the
prevalence of activating FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations.
Six (1.2%) FGFR3 activating mutations were identified,
including 5 S249C mutations and 1 R248C mutation
(Figure 2A). No FGFR2 activating mutations were
detected.

Clinicopathologic characteristics of NSCLC
patients harboring FGFR3 mutations, AKT1
mutations, EGFR ECD mutations, HER2 ECD
and transmembrane domain mutations, ARAF
mutations or NRG1 fusions
All the 6 lung squamous cell carcinoma patients
with oncogenic FGFR3 mutations were male, and 5 of
them were ever smokers. They all have tumors larger than
3 cm in diameter (mean: 5.4, range: 3.2–8.0). However,
N2 disease was not found in any case (4 N0 and 2 N1).
Both of the two adenocarcinoma cases with CD74-NRG1
fusions were female never-smoking stage I invasive
mucinous adenocarcinoma. Detailed clinicopathologic
characteristics of patients with these rare mutations were
listed in Table 1. Individual characteristics of patients
harboring other mutations were showed in Supplementary
Table S1.
We then compared clinicopathologic characteristics
between the 17 lung squamous cell carcinoma patients
harboring FGFR fusions or FGFR mutations and 138 lung
squamous cell carcinoma cases (both FGFR fusions and
FGFR mutations were negative) from October 2007 to
April 2010. Age, gender, smoking history, tumor size, nodal
status and pathologic stage were not significantly different
between the two groups (Table 2). RFS (P = 0.562) and OS
(P = 0.988) were also comparable (Figure 3).

ALK fusions were compared to that of wild-type patients
(Supplementary Figure S1). No significant survival
difference was found. A total of 190 lung adenocarcinoma
patients with classic EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R
experienced disease recurrence. Eighty-one of these
patients received EGFR TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib)
treatment after disease recurrence. Compared to those
who did not receive TKIs, patients who were treated with
TKIs had significantly better OS (P < 0.001) (Figure 4A).
We further performed the survival analysis according to
the initial pathologic stage (Figure 4B and 4C). Patients
treated with targeted therapies had significantly better
survival outcomes both in the stage I-II group (P =
0.005) and the stage III group (P < 0.001). Multivariate
analysis adjusting for age, sex, smoking history and
pathologic stage revealed that treatment with EGFR TKIs
was an independent predictor of better OS (HR = 0.299,
95% CI: 0.172–0.519, P < 0.001).

to be feasible by the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium
(LCMC) [10]. Here, we performed a comprehensive
analysis of oncogenic driver mutations in a large series of
Chinese NSCLC patients.
EGFR (15.8%) and KRAS (21.1%) mutations were
present in a considerable proportion in lung large cell
carcinoma. De Pas and colleagues [11] reported a case
of lung large cell carcinoma patient harboring EGFR
mutation having dramatic response to gefitinib treatment.
We further found that lung sarcomatoid carcinoma had a
high frequency (37.5%) of KRAS mutations. Our results
have implications for targeted therapy for patients with
these rare histologic subtypes of NSCLC.
Liao and colleagues reported in 2013 the
identification of inhibitor-sensitive oncogenic FGFR2
and FGFR3 mutations in lung squamous cell carcinoma
from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset [12].
They reported a mutation rate of 3% for each of the two
genes. However, we screened more than 500 Chinese
lung squamous cell carcinoma samples, and found that
oncogenic FGFR3 mutations were present in only 1.2%
(5 S249C and 1 R248C). No oncogenic FGFR2 mutations
were detected in this series of patients. In addition to the

Using multiplexed assays of oncogenic drivers in
lung cancers to select targeted drugs has been demonstrated

3.5% (11 out of 312) of FGFR fusions in lung squamous
cell carcinoma [8], approximately 5% of Chinese
lung squamous cell carcinoma could be defined by
oncogenic alterations in the FGFR family genes. Through
clinicopathologic analysis, we also found that patients
with oncogenic FGFR3 mutations were characterized by
male, smokers, and larger tumor size without mediastinal
lymph node metastasis.
Currently, the detection of mutations in ERBB
family genes is mainly limited to the kinase domains
of EGFR and HER2. However, the identification of
oncogenic driver mutations in other sites of the ERBB
family genes has continuously been reported [13–17]. For
example, oncogenic HER2 extracellular domain mutations
were found in 0.8% (2 out of 258) of lung adenocarcinoma
in the TCGA dataset [13]. Jaiswal and colleagues [14]
reported oncogenic ERBB3 mutations were present
in approximately 1% of lung adenocarcinoma from
a Western cohort. Here we found two EGFR ECD
mutations (A289D and R324L), one HER2 ECD mutation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(S310Y), one HER2 transmembrane domain mutation
(V659E) and no ERBB3 activating mutations, suggesting
that oncogenic driver mutations in non-EGFR or HER2
kinase domain of ERBB family genes do exist, but in a
very small proportion of Chinese lung adenocarcinoma
patients.
Imielinski and colleagues [18] reported that
oncogenic and sorafenib-sensitive ARAF mutations were
present in 1% of lung adenocarcinoma cases in the TCGA
samples. NRG1 fusions were also identified as novel
oncogenic driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma
[19, 20]. The frequency of NRG1 fusions was reported
to be approximately 1.7% in lung adenocarcinomas from
an Asian population [20]. Here, we found one ARAF
mutation (S214C) and two CD74-NRG1 fusions in 219
“pan-negative” lung adenocarcinoma cases. Both of the
two cases with NRG1 fusions were invasive mucinous
adenocarcinoma, which was consistent with previous
reports that NRG1 fusions were characterized by invasive
mucinous adenocarcinoma histology [19, 20].

Targeting oncogenic driver mutations has
transformed the management of lung adenocarcinoma
patients. Kris and colleagues [10] investigated the
presence of oncogenic mutations of 10 genes in more
than 1000 lung adenocarcinoma patients, and revealed
that patients with an oncogenic driver and received
genotype-directed therapy had significantly prolonged
survival than those with an oncogenic mutation but
did not receive genotype-directed therapy. Here, we
investigated the effect of EGFR TKIs on EGFR-mutated
lung adenocarcinoma patients after disease recurrence.
Compared to those who did not receive TKIs, patients
who were treated with TKIs had significantly better OS.
Multivariate analysis showed the administration with
EGFR TKIs was an independent predictor of better OS.
The superiority of EGFR TKIs (including gefitinib,
erlotinib and afatinib) over conventional chemotherapy
in advanced lung adenocarcinoma has been well
demonstrated in Phase III randomized trials [3–6, 21].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no clinical
trial specifically investigating the efficacy of EGFR TKIs
in lung cancer patients who have recurrent disease after
surgical resection. Our results further supported the role
of genotype-directed therapies for lung adenocarcinoma
patients.
In conclusion, we determined the frequency of
driver mutations in a large series of Chinese NSCLC
patients. EGFR TKIs might improve the survival outcomes
of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma patients who
experienced disease recurrence.

and kinase domain), KRAS (exons 2–3), BRAF (exons
11–15), AKT1, ARAF, FGFR2 (extracellular domain and
kinase domain) and FGFR3 (extracellular domain) by
PCR using cDNA. Direct dideoxynucleotide sequencing
was used to analyze the amplified products. For newly
identified mutations, we sequenced the germline DNA
from the paired normal lung tissues to demonstrate
they are somatically acquired. For the detection of
ALK, ROS1, RET, NRG1, FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3
fusions, we designed multiple pairs of primers to cover
all the known fusion variants.

Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center were
consecutively collected. Eligibility criteria included
sufficient tissue for comprehensive mutational analysis
and no neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After frozen tumor
specimens were dissected into TRIzol (Invitrogen),
total RNA were extracted per standard protocol
(RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and
were subsequently reverse transcribed into cDNA
using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Fermentas, St Leon-Rot, Germany). Clinicopathologic
data prospectively collected included age at diagnosis,
gender, smoking history, pathologic TNM stage and
tumor histology.
