Abstract
Malignant gliomas are highly invasive and chemoresistant brain tumors with extremely poor prognosis.
Targeting of the soluble factors that trigger invasion and resistance, therefore, could have a signiﬁcant impact
against the inﬁltrative glioma cells that are a major source of recurrence. Fibulin-3 is a matrix protein that is
absent in normal brain but upregulated in gliomas and promotes tumor invasion by unknown mechanisms. Here,
we show that ﬁbulin-3 is a novel soluble activator of Notch signaling that antagonizes DLL3, an autocrine inhibitor
or Notch, and promotes tumor cell survival and invasion in a Notch-dependent manner. Using a strategy for
inducible knockdown, we found that controlled downregulation of ﬁbulin-3 reduced Notch signaling and led to
increased apoptosis, reduced self-renewal of glioblastoma-initiating cells, and impaired growth and dispersion of
intracranial tumors. In addition, ﬁbulin-3 expression correlated with expression levels of Notch-dependent genes
and was a marker of Notch activation in patient-derived glioma samples. These ﬁndings underscore a major role
for the tumor extracellular matrix in regulating glioma invasion and resistance to apoptosis via activation of the
key Notch pathway. More importantly, this work describes a noncanonical, soluble activator of Notch in a cancer
model and shows how Notch signaling can be reduced by targeting tumor-speciﬁc accessible molecules in the
tumor microenvironment. Cancer Res; 72(15); 3873–85. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain
tumors and one of the types of cancer with worst prognosis
(1, 2). Despite signiﬁcant advances in neurosurgery and
chemoradiotherapy, gliomas remain highly resistant to conventional treatments and improvements in patient outcome
have been modest (3). A major challenge for glioma therapy
is the typical scattering of invasive tumor cells in the brain,
escaping resection and leading to recurrence (4). Cumulative
evidence suggests that these invasive cells are highly resistant to cytotoxic therapies (5, 6) and that their dispersion
may be triggered, in part, by these treatments (7, 8).
Improved targeting of the mechanisms that promote glioma
invasion and facilitate chemoresistance is therefore critical
to increase the long-term efﬁcacy of current therapeutic
approaches.

The discovery and characterization of glioma-initiating
stem-like cells (GIC) that share properties with neural stem
cells (9) has brought attention to a number of signaling pathways in glioma that are also involved in neural development,
such as Hedgehog, Wnt, and Notch (10, 11). These pathways are
necessary for the maintenance of GICs (12, 13) and critical for
glioma initiation, self-renewal, and progression through stages
of malignancy (11, 14), all of which makes them appealing
pharmacologic targets. While Hedgehog and Wnt are activated
by soluble factors, Notch activation is usually a juxtacrine
signaling mechanism that mediates close cell-to-cell signaling
(15), which becomes less likely as tumor cells scatter. A few
soluble, noncanonical activators of Notch signaling have been
described in mammals [e.g., MAGP-1/2, CCN3, and YB-1
(ref. 15)] but their relationship with Notch signaling in cancer
progression has not been elucidated.
The ﬁbulins are a family of secreted proteins that associate
to the extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold, forming anchoring
structures that can regulate cell proliferation and migration
(16, 17). Several ﬁbulins have been associated with the development of solid tumors such as ovarian, breast, and colorectal
cancers (16, 17), but their role in cancer initiation and progression has been difﬁcult to deﬁne (16–18). Fibulin-3, also
known as EFEMP1, is a protein of restricted expression in the
body, predominantly localized in the ECM of elastic tissues
(19). This protein is absent from normal brain (19, 20) and is
downregulated in several types of solid tumors (21, 22). Surprisingly, ﬁbulin-3 is highly upregulated in gliomas, where it
promotes tumor growth and invasion (22). Recent results
suggest that ﬁbulin-3 is also upregulated in some highly

metastatic tumors, where it correlates with the progression of
these tumors toward the invasive phenotype (23, 24). The
molecular mechanisms of this protein in cancer are still
essentially unknown.
Here, we report that ﬁbulin-3 is a novel soluble activator of
Notch signaling, acting through an unconventional mechanism that reduces cis-inhibition of Notch. Our results show
that ﬁbulin-3 regulates the Notch pathway in glioma and
promotes resistance to apoptosis as well as tumor growth and
invasion in a Notch-dependent manner. This is the ﬁrst demonstration of a secreted matrix molecule that regulates the
Notch pathway in cancer to promote tumor progression.

Materials and Methods
Cells and tissue specimens
The human glioblastoma cell lines U87 and U251 and the rat
glioblastoma cell line CNS1 were cultured as previously
described (22) and authenticated using the Cell Check service
provided by the Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory
(RADIL, Columbia, MO). Primary glioblastoma-derived initiating cells (GICs G2, G8, G34, and G146) were kindly provided
by Drs. E. Chiocca and I. Nakano of the Department of
Neurological Surgery, The Ohio State University (OSU; Columbus, OH), and cultured as ﬂoating neurospheres in DMEM:
Ham's F-12 supplemented with 2 mmol/L glutamine, 20 ng/mL
EGF, 20 ng/mL basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF), 2 mg/mL
grade-1A heparin, and B27 supplement (Invitrogen). These
cells were validated for self-renewal, ability to form tumors
in low numbers, and multilineage differentiation. Tissue
microarrays containing multiple replicate cores of formalinﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded glioma specimens were purchased
from US Biomax, yielding 65 independent samples.
DNA constructs, siRNAs, and lentivirus
A clone containing the full-length coding sequence of ﬁbulin-3 was previously described (22). From this clone, the
variants ﬁb-3Dn and ﬁb-3Dc were generated by deleting the
sequences Glu19-Ser106 and Cys379-Phe493, respectively. Fulllength DLL3 cDNA (25) was subcloned into pCDNA4.1-V5/His
for expression and epitope tagging. The following constructs
have already been described (26, 27) and were used without
modiﬁcations: full-length rat Notch-1 (pBOS-rNotch1), fulllength rat Jagged-1 (pBOS-SN3T), constitutively active mouse
Notch-1 intracellular domain (pSG5-FLAG-NICD), and a Notch
reporter construct carrying ﬁreﬂy luciferase under control of
4xCBF1 binding elements (pGL2Pro-CBF1-Luc). Comparison
of N-terminal sequences of ﬁbulin-3 and Notch ligands was
carried out using ClustalW software (Supplementary Fig. S1).
SiRNA oligonucleotides against ﬁbulin-3 and Notch-1 were
purchased from Qiagen and validated at the mRNA and protein
levels (Supplementary Fig. S2).
The lentiviral vector pLVET-tTR-KRAB-eGFP used for doxycycline-dependent short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression has
been described (28). shRNAs against ﬁbulin-3 or a nontargeting
control sequence (GenScript) were cloned into the shuttle
vector pLVTHM and then subcloned into the lentiviral backbone. After stable transduction, tumor cells were treated with

20 mg/mL doxycycline for 48 hours to induce shRNA and eGFP
expression. Inducible ﬁbulin-3 knockdown was conﬁrmed in 3
independent glioma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Immunohistochemistry
Human tissue sections (5 mm) were deparafﬁnized and
processed for immunohistochemistry with antibodies against
ﬁbulin-3 and Hes1 (listed in Supplementary Table S1). Scoring
was conducted blindly by a pathologist (G.J. Nuovo), using a
scale from 0 (absent staining) to 100 (whole visual ﬁeld stained;
ref. 29). Frozen mouse brains were coronally sectioned at 20
mm and every fourth section stained with 0.1% w/v cresyl violet
(22). Imaging software (ImageJ v.1.45) was used to measure
maximum coronal area and distance from the geometric
center of the tumor to the most distant border. Sections
selected for immunohistochemistry were probed with an
antibody against the proliferation marker Ki67 (22) or processed for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (Apoptag Red Kit,
Millipore).
Biochemical assays
Cells were recovered from culture, lysed, and processed for
Western blotting using standard protocols (ref. 22; antibodies
are listed in Supplementary Table S1). To analyze protein
phosphorylation, cells were incubated in serum-free media
overnight before treatments. In vitro effects of ﬁbulin-3 were
analyzed by incubating glioma cells with puriﬁed ﬁbulin-3 (100
ng/mL) for 2 hours. Short-time incubations (15 minutes) were
also carried out to compare activity of ﬁbulin-3 against a
canonical EGF receptor (EGFR) ligand (EGF, 5 ng/mL). For
semiquantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR), cells or tissue samples were processed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and
total RNA was puriﬁed by ethanol precipitation. For Notch
reporter assays, cells were transfected with the Notch reporter
construct and Renilla luciferase as loading control. Reporter
cells were exposed to puriﬁed ﬁbulin-3 for 8 hours or cotransfected with different constructs and processed after 24 hours to
quantify luciferase activity.
Migration and invasion assays
Cell migration was quantiﬁed with a conventional assay in
culture inserts (Transwell, 8 mm pore size), using bovine ﬁbronectin (5 mg/mL) as chemoattractant. Cells (5,000 cells/well)
were allowed to migrate for 16 hours and subsequently ﬁxed,
stained, and counted (30). Invasion of cells out of spheroids
implanted in cultured brain slices was carried out as described
(30) and total dispersion quantiﬁed by ﬂuorescence microscopy. The g-secretase inhibitor DAPT (25 mmol/L, Tocris) was
added to the cells 2 hours before seeding and maintained in the
medium during these experiments. Transfection with cDNAs
or siRNAs was carried out 48 hours before preparing cell
spheroids to deposit on brain slices.
Cell viability and self-renewal
Cell viability was monitored using a standard redox assay
(Promega CellTiter Kit). Cells treated with serum depletion or
temozolomide (Tocris) were labeled with propidium iodide

(PI)/Annexin-V following standard protocols and analyzed
using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). To
measure apoptosis/necrosis in multiwell plates, cells were
labeled as before and quantiﬁed by ﬂuorescence microscopy.
To evaluate GIC self-renewal, cells were dissociated, plated in
serial dilutions as described (31), and new spheroids quantiﬁed
after 12 to 14 days.
Animal studies
All studies involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at OSU. Glioma
cells were resuspended at 2.5  104 cells/mL in Hanks'
buffered saline solution supplemented with 0.1% w/v glucose. The cell suspension (2 mL) was injected into the right
striatum of 8-week-old nude (nu/nu) mice following standard protocols. Induction of ﬁbulin-3 shRNA was achieved
with 1 mg/mL doxycycline in the drinking water, starting 3
days after tumor implantation. Animals were euthanized
and tumors harvested for histologic analysis 20 days after
implantation. For survival studies, animals were kept until
they reached physiologic criteria for early removal or
euthanasia.
Statistics
All experiments in vitro were repeated at least in triplicate
with 3 independent replicates (8 replicates for brain slice
invasion assays). Animal studies were conducted with N ¼ 5
(histology) or N ¼ 10 (survival) animals per experimental
condition. Results were analyzed by one-factor or multifactorial ANOVA, followed by the Bonferroni posthoc test. Immunohistochemical scoring was analyzed using Spearman nonparametric rank correlation. Survival curves were compared by
log-rank test.

Results
Fibulin-3 is a paracrine activator of Notch signaling
Fibulin-3 binds to large ECM proteins with lower afﬁnity
than other members of this family (19), therefore being a largely
soluble factor (22). Other than its binding to ECM proteins, the
molecular mechanisms triggered by ﬁbulin-3 are almost
completely unknown.
We ﬁrst investigated whether ﬁbulin-3 could activate the
EGFR pathway in glioma cells because this mechanism has
been described in pancreatic carcinoma cells (32), although
opposite results have been shown in nasopharyngeal carcinomas (33). We used a conventional glioma cell line (U87) with
moderate expression of endogenous ﬁbulin-3 (22) and well
characterized EGFR signaling. Short-time exposure (15 minutes) of these cells to puriﬁed ﬁbulin-3 failed to activate EGFR,
mitogen–activated protein kinase (MAPK), or Akt (Fig. 1A);
similar results were observed with longer exposure (2 hours) or
after transfection of the cells with ﬁbulin-3 cDNA. This was not
caused by lack of EGFR activity because the pathway was
triggered by the canonical ligand, EGF, incubated for the same
amounts of time (Fig. 1A). The same results were obtained with
the glioma cell line U251 (not shown), indicating that this
mechanism was not a primary target of ﬁbulin-3 in glioma cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

To identify other potential mechanisms triggered by ﬁbulin3 we analyzed its sequence and identiﬁed a considerable
conservation of a Delta-Serrate-Lag motif, characteristic of
the extracellular domain of Notch ligands (Supplementary Fig.
S1). Accordingly, ﬁbulin-3 promoted Notch-1 cleavage and
upregulation of the active Notch-1 intracellular domain
(NICD; Fig. 1A), an effect that has never been described for
the members of the ﬁbulin family.
To validate this ﬁnding, we generated reporter HEK293 cells,
which do not express ﬁbulin-3, expressing full-length Notch-1
and an RBPJk-dependent Notch-responsive luciferase reporter
(26). These cells were cocultured in equal proportion with
HEK293 cells expressing ﬁbulin-3 or the canonical Notch
ligand, Jagged-1. The luciferase reporter was activated in both
cases, showing that Notch signaling was activated by ﬁbulin-3
from neighboring cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, when the reporter
cells were cultured in the conditioned medium of the ligandexpressing HEK293 cells, only the medium from ﬁbulin-3secreting cells activated the reporter whereas the medium
from Jagged-expressing cells failed to do so (Fig. 1B), conﬁrming the role of ﬁbulin-3 as a paracrine, rather than juxtacrine,
Notch activator. Exposure of reporter HEK293 cells to afﬁnitypuriﬁed ﬁbulin-3 yielded the same results (Fig. 1B).
To further verify these ﬁndings, we used rat glioblastoma
CNS1 cells, which reproduce the phenotype of highly invasive
gliomas and share multiple properties with neural progenitors
including high endogenous expression of Notch-1. Transfection of these cells with the Notch-responsive reporter conﬁrmed that puriﬁed ﬁbulin-3 was sufﬁcient to activate the
reporter (Fig. 1C). Moreover, this activation was abolished by
preincubation of the cells with the g-secretase inhibitor DAPT
or by transfection with siRNAs against Notch-1, suggesting that
this was the predominant Notch receptor mediating the effect
of ﬁbulin-3. Exposure of CNS1 cells to ﬁbulin-3 conﬁrmed
activation of endogenous Notch-1 in a g-secretase–dependent
manner (Fig. 1D).
Finally, to determine which domain(s) of ﬁbulin-3 were
required for Notch activation we tested deletion constructs
of ﬁbulin-3 lacking either the N-terminal domain (ﬁb-3Dn)
containing the DSL-like motif or the C-terminal domain (ﬁb3Dc) that contains a domain common to all ﬁbulins. CNS1 cells
expressing ﬁb-3Dn failed to show activation of the Notchdependent reporter (Fig. 1E) or increase of endogenous NICD
(Fig. 1F), whereas the effects of ﬁb-3Dc were essentially undistinguishable from those of full-length ﬁbulin-3, suggesting that
the DSL-like motif was critical for Notch pathway activation.
Fibulin-3 antagonizes the cis-inhibitor of Notch, DLL3
We next investigated whether the effects of ﬁbulin-3 were a
result of direct binding to Notch-1 but could not detect
coprecipitation of these 2 proteins. Similarly, we were unable
to detect any effect of ﬁbulin-3 on the activity of the proteases
ADAM10/ADAM17 involved in Notch activation (not shown).
Therefore, we focused on a possible effect of ﬁbulin-3 on the
mechanism of cis-inhibition that regulates Notch activity.
Notch ligands of the Delta family are known to increase Notch
activity when expressed in a neighboring cell (trans-activation)
but inhibit Notch when expressed in the same cell as Notch

Figure 1. Fibulin-3 activates Notch signaling in glioma cells. A, U87 cells transfected with ﬁbulin-3 or exposed to puriﬁed ﬁbulin-3 (ﬁb-3, 100 ng/mL) did not
show signiﬁcant activation of EGFR signaling compared with controls, but increased the expression of NICD fragment (arrow). Exposure of the cells to EGF (5
ng/mL) showed that the EGFR pathway was functional. Fibulin-3 levels were determined by Western blotting in serum-free culture medium
(n.d., not determined). B, Notch reporter HEK293 cells were cocultured for 24 hours with HEK293 cells expressing control (ctrl), ﬁbulin-3, or Jagged-1 (Jag-1)
cDNAs or were exposed for 24 hours to the conditioned medium from those cells. The reporter was activated by ﬁbulin-3–secreting cells and their
medium (paracrine activation). In contrast, the reporter was activated by Jagged-1–expressing cells but not by their medium (juxtacrine activation). Fib-3-myc:

(cis-inhibition; ref. 15). The Notch ligand DLL3 is unique in that
it acts as a cis-inhibitor of Notch receptors expressed in the
same cell but lacks trans-activating activity (25).
Using CNS1 glioma cells, we observed that transient upregulation or knockdown of ﬁbulin-3 resulted in opposite
changes in the expression of DLL1 and DLL3 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that ﬁbulin-3 mechanisms could involve effects on these
proteins. In addition, puriﬁed ﬁbulin-3 (not shown) as well as
endogenous ﬁbulin-3 consistently coprecipitated with DLL3
expressed in glioma cells (Fig. 2B).
To conﬁrm whether ﬁbulin-3 was competing with DLL3 we
expressed both proteins in CNS1 cells carrying the Notchresponsive reporter (Fig. 2C). Overexpression of DLL3 did not
reduce baseline Notch activity, but signiﬁcantly inhibited
Notch activation mediated by ﬁbulin-3 or the canonical ligand
Jagged-1. Together, these results suggested that the Notchactivating effect of ﬁbulin-3 was likely mediated by down-

regulating DLL3 or blocking the inhibitory effect of DLL3 over

Fibulin-3 regulates Notch activity and correlates with
Notch activation in glioma
We next investigated whether the expression of ﬁbulin-3 in
gliomas effectively correlated with Notch activity. Overexpression of ﬁbulin-3 in glioma cells resulted in signiﬁcant upregulation of Notch-dependent genes such as Hes1 (Fig. 3A) and
Hes5 (Fig. 3B), whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of ﬁbulin3 downregulated both genes. More importantly, the effects of
ﬁbulin-3 downregulation were reproduced using GICs, suggesting that ﬁbulin-3 levels can modulate Notch activity in this
key population of tumor cells.
To determine whether the correlation between ﬁbulin-3
levels and Notch activity was maintained in patient-derived
specimens, we carried out double immunohistochemistry for

ﬁbulin-3 and Hes1 in 13 controls and 52 glioma specimens.
Results showed that ﬁbulin-3 and Hes1 were very low or absent
in normal tissue (Fig. 3C) but were coexpressed in tumor cells
(not shown) and their expression increased with tumor grade
(Fig. 3C). There was a signiﬁcant positive correlation between
ﬁbulin-3 and Hes1 expression (Fig. 3D) except in a small subset
of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas that had low ﬁbulin-3
expression but high levels of Hes1. Interestingly, overexpression of NICD or knockdown of Notch-1 in glioma cells did not
affect ﬁbulin-3 expression (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting
that ﬁbulin-3 is not a Notch target. Therefore, the observed
correlation in gliomas was most likely due to regulation of
Notch signaling by ﬁbulin-3. Taken together, these results
underscored ﬁbulin-3 as a marker of Notch activity and
potential regulator of this pathway in glioma.

Figure 2. Fibulin-3 antagonizes the effect of DLL3. A, CNS1 cells were
transfected with ﬁbulin-3 cDNA, ﬁbulin-3 siRNA, or their respective
controls and processed for qRT-PCR after 24 hours. Overexpression
or knockdown of ﬁbulin-3 resulted in the opposite expression of DLL1
and DLL3 (  , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA). B, CNS1 cells
expressing endogenous ﬁbulin-3 and V5-tagged DLL3 (DLL3-V5) were
lysed and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-ﬁbulin-3
or anti-V5 antibodies. Western blotting (WB) revealed a direct
association between ﬁbulin-3 and DLL3 (arrows). Asterisks indicate
antibody bands. C, CNS1 cells stably expressing the Notchresponsive reporter were transfected with combinations of plasmids
carrying Notch-1, DLL3, ﬁbulin-3 (ﬁb-3), or Jagged-1 (Jag-1) and
analyzed after 24 hours. DLL3 did not affect the baseline reporter
activity, but signiﬁcantly blocked the enhancing effects of ﬁbulin-3 and
Jagged-1 (differences from control at  , P < 0.05;    , P < 0.001,

The proinvasive effect of ﬁbulin-3 in gliomas is Notchdependent
In a previous study, we showed that ﬁbulin-3 promotes
glioma invasion (22) but did not identify the underlying
molecular mechanism. Therefore, we next asked whether the
proinvasive role of ﬁbulin-3 in gliomas would be mediated by
Notch signaling.
To test this hypothesis we ﬁrst analyzed cell migration in a
Transwell assay using U251 and CNS1 cells. Fibulin-3 overexpression increased total cell migration, as expected, but this
effect was abolished by DAPT (Fig. 4A). Because DAPT did not
affect baseline migration, we concluded that Notch signaling
was not necessary for basal cell motility but was required to
mediate the promigratory effect of ﬁbulin-3.
To further determine whether Notch was necessary for the
proinvasive role of ﬁbulin-3 we analyzed cell invasion through
neural ECM, using glioma spheroids implanted in cultured
brain slices. This is an extensively validated model (22, 30, 34) to
study glioma cell invasion under conditions that accurately
reproduce the natural barriers to cell motility in the brain.
Using highly invasive CNS1 cells, we conﬁrmed that the proinvasive effect of ﬁbulin-3 could be suppressed by DAPT (Fig. 4B)
or by transfection of the cells with Notch-1 siRNA (Fig. 4C).
We ﬁnally investigated the proinvasive effects of ﬁbulin-3 on
GICs, which are thought to be a key inﬁltrative population in
gliomas (6). Knockdown of Notch-1 reduced GIC invasion
through neural ECM and completely abolished the proinvasive
effect of ﬁbulin-3 (Fig. 4D). Together, these results support a
novel role for Notch signaling as a proinvasive pathway in
gliomas and the major underlying mechanism for the invasive
effects of ﬁbulin-3.
Fibulin-3 promotes glioma cell survival in a Notchdependent manner
The Notch pathway is critically required for survival of
glioma cells (35). Given our results showing the regulation of
Notch signaling by ﬁbulin-3, we next asked whether this ECM
protein could regulate glioma cell viability, making it a potential chemosensitizing target.
To test this hypothesis, U251 and CNS1 cells were transfected with control or ﬁbulin-3–speciﬁc siRNAs and subjected
to serum starvation as a simple proapoptotic condition.

expression of cleaved caspase-3, a typical marker of apoptosis
(Fig. 5B). However, when ﬁbulin-3 siRNA was cotransfected
with increasing amounts of the NICD fragment, the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly reduced upon
starvation (Fig. 5C). This result suggested that the antiapoptotic effect of ﬁbulin-3 was Notch-dependent and could be
rescued by independent activation of Notch signaling.
To conﬁrm whether ﬁbulin-3 downregulation could be
used as a chemosensitizing strategy, U251 cells were subjected to ﬁbulin-3 knockdown followed by brieﬂy treatment
with temozolomide, which is the standard-of-care cytotoxic
agent for malignant gliomas. Downregulation of ﬁbulin-3
signiﬁcantly reduced cell viability in presence of temozolomide (Fig. 5D) and increased the percentages of apoptotic
and necrotic cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner

(Fig. 5E). This underscored the potential relevance of ﬁbulin-3 downregulation for chemosensitizing strategies in
gliomas.
Downregulation of ﬁbulin-3 reduces glioma stem cell
viability and self-renewal
We next attempted to generate glioma cells with stable
knockdown of ﬁbulin-3 but these cells showed deﬁcient growth
and cell clumping (Supplementary Fig. S5), possibly due to
sustained negative effects on Notch signaling. Therefore, we
used a lentiviral system for doxycycline-inducible expression of
shRNAs (described in Materials and Methods and Supplementary Fig. S3). Lentiviruses carrying inducible shRNAs were used
for stable transduction of glioma cells (U251 and CNS1) and
GICs (G8 and G34).

Fibulin-3 Activates Notch Signaling in Gliomas

Cultures transduced with shRNAs and maintained in
absence of doxycycline showed similar growth curves (Fig.
6A). In contrast, induction of ﬁbulin-3 shRNA caused a significant loss of viability in conventional glioma cells and GICs (Fig.
6A). We investigated the effect in GICs in further detail, asking
whether ﬁbulin-3 knockdown would affect the self-renewal
ability of these cells. G8 and G34 GICs cultured in limiting
dilutions after induction of ﬁbulin-3 shRNA showed signiﬁcantly reduced formation of tumor spheres, an effect that was
more noticeable when the cells were processed for a second
round of sphere formation (Fig. 6B). Visual inspection of the
tumor spheres showed in many cases the formation of partially
dissociated cell aggregates (Fig. 6C). These results strongly
supported the prosurvival role of ﬁbulin-3 in glioma cells.
Downregulation of ﬁbulin-3 reduces tumor growth and
increases overall survival
Finally, we determined whether controlled downregulation
of ﬁbulin-3 would affect tumor development in vivo. We
implanted CNS1, G8, and G34 cells intracranially and induced
shRNA expression after tumor implantation. The resulting
gliomas showed efﬁcient long-term downregulation of ﬁbulin-3 and Notch-regulated genes in the tumor tissue (Supplementary Fig. S6). Histologic (Fig. 7A) and morphometric (Fig.
7B) analysis showed a signiﬁcant reduction in size and dispersion of tumors with ﬁbulin-3 knockdown compared with
controls. This was not due to defects in cell proliferation
because the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in ﬁbulin-3–
deﬁcient tumors was not signiﬁcantly different from controls
(Supplementary Fig. S6). However, ﬁbulin-3 knockdown
resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of apoptotic
cells (Supplementary Fig. S6), explaining the reduced growth.
In agreement with these results, animals bearing tumors with
controlled downregulation of ﬁbulin-3 showed signiﬁcantly
extended survival compared with controls (Fig. 7C).
Our results from animal models agreed with data from
human glioblastomas queried from the databases The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Repository for Molecular Brain
Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT). Fibulin-3 was highly upregulated in the vast majority of samples from those databases
(Supplementary Fig. S7). Nevertheless, survival analysis
showed that the small subpopulation of patients with downregulated ﬁbulin-3 had signiﬁcantly longer overall survival (Fig.
7D). Furthermore, meta-analysis of high-grade gliomas
grouped by transcriptional proﬁle (Gene Expression Omnibus
data set GSE4271; ref. 36) showed that ﬁbulin-3 levels were
always higher in gliomas identiﬁed as "mesenchymal" (Supplementary Fig. S7), which have poor overall survival compared
with other molecular subtypes. Together, these results underscored the potential relevance of ﬁbulin-3 for high-grade
glioma classiﬁcation and prognosis.

Discussion
Malignant gliomas are highly resistant to conventional
radio- and chemotherapy, which, coupled to their invasive
ability, facilitates tumor recurrence. Novel pharmacologic and
molecular strategies are focused on targeting signaling

pathways to increase apoptotic sensitivity (37, 38) and improve
the efﬁcacy of adjuvant therapies. Importantly, accumulated
evidence suggests that an invasive cellular phenotype is associated with increased chemoresistance (4, 6). Therefore, targeting proinvasive factors in glioma could contribute not only
to reducing tumor dispersal but also to increasing the sensitivity of already dispersed malignant cells (37, 39).

Antiinvasive treatments for glioma have targeted several
potential candidates, including cytoskeletal proteins, cell-surface adhesion receptors, secreted proteases, and soluble paracrine/autocrine factors (40). However, there has been little

could have a direct impact on tumor cell survival. Our results

Fibulin-3 Activates Notch Signaling in Gliomas

gliomas compared with normal neural tissue (22), increases
tumor cell invasion and, in addition, promotes tumor cell
survival by regulating a critical pathway for glioma growth
and resistance to apoptosis (35).
Fibulin-3 is a member of the "small ﬁbulins" group (ﬁbulins3, -4 and -5), which have been shown to act either as protumoral
or tumor suppressor genes in different types of solid cancer
and different stages of tumor progression (16, 17). Their
molecular mechanisms have been difﬁcult to identify due to
the multiple functions of the ﬁbulins in cancer and the fact that
their molecular partners are largely unknown. Fibulin-3 is
downregulated in several types of solid tumors (21, 22) but,
surprisingly, is the most upregulated member of the ﬁbulin
family in malignant gliomas (22). We have shown clear tumorpromoting effects of ﬁbulin-3 in gliomas, including enhanced
cell invasion, increased tumor volume, and reduced animal
survival (22). A similar role of ﬁbulin-3 has been proposed in
other highly invasive tumors, such as high-grade pancreatic
and cervical carcinomas (23, 41). Surprisingly, a tumor-suppressor effect of ﬁbulin-3 was recently reported in a noninvasive glioma model and indirectly attributed to an antiangiogenic effect (42). Although this result is difﬁcult to explain, it is
worth noting that a previously described antiangiogenic effect
of ﬁbulin-3 (21) was caused by a recombinant form that is
absent in gliomas and lacks its critical N-terminal domain (22).
On the other hand, data from large populations of high-grade
glioma patients, available from multiple databases, strongly
supports the protumoral role of ﬁbulin-3 in glioma. Our
previous meta-analysis of REMBRANDT and ONCOMINE data
(22) and current analysis of REMBRANDT and TCGA data (Fig.
7 and Supplementary Fig. S7) show that ﬁbulin-3 is highly and
speciﬁcally upregulated in patients with glioma, increases with
grade, and correlates with reduced patient survival. Taken
together, the speciﬁc upregulation of this protein in gliomas
and its enhancing effect on tumor growth and invasion emphasize the potential of ﬁbulin-3 as a relevant target in the tumor
microenvironment.
The Notch signaling pathway is one of the major pathways
dysregulated in cancers (43), including gliomas (10). Notch
signaling contributes to maintaining the glioma initiating cell
population (12) and disruption of this pathway critically
reduces cell proliferation and survival (35). Recent results also
suggest the involvement of Notch signaling in glioma cell
motility (44, 45), increasing the interest in targeting this
pathway as an anti-invasive and chemosensitizing strategy.
Interestingly, Notch receptors and their ligands are upregulated in gliomas (10, 35) but the expression of DLL and Jagged
family members does not seem to follow a common pattern
with tumor grade (35). On the other hand, upregulation of
downstream genes regulated by Notch (Hes1, Hes2, and Hey1)
correlates better with tumor grade (10, 46), suggesting that
Notch signaling may be activated by additional mechanisms,
such as the one we have described here for ﬁbulin-3.
Canonical Notch signaling is initiated by cell–cell interaction between cells expressing Notch receptors and those
expressing DLL and Jagged ligands. Notch activation by
secreted molecules is uncommon and the evidence in cancer
models is virtually absent. Soluble factors that activate

www.aacrjournals.org

Notch in mammalian cells include the proteins MAGP-1/
2, CCN3, and YB-1 (15). Of these, CCN3 and YB-1 have been
shown to promote tumor growth (47, 48) but it has not been
elucidated if they achieve this effect through Notch activation. In contrast, our results are the ﬁrst to show a soluble
factor in a cancer model that activates the Notch pathway
and likely achieves its protumoral effects in gliomas by
reducing cis-inhibition of Notch and increasing Notch signaling in tumor cells.
A possible mechanism of ﬁbulin-3 as antagonist of DLL3 is
particularly interesting because the role of this Notch ligand in
cancer is poorly, if at all, deﬁned. Current evidence indicates
that DLL3 does not trans-activate Notch but inhibits this
pathway when expressed in the same cell as the Notch receptor
(25). It has been proposed that this could be partly due to the
formation of a Notch–DLL3 complex retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (49), although the localization of DLL3 is still
subject of debate (25) and has not been analyzed in cancer cells.
Fibulin-3 could bind to and inhibit DLL3 intracellularly, or
trigger DLL3 downregulation by additional mechanisms to
activate Notch signaling.
Interestingly, DLL3 is a signature gene of high-grade
gliomas deﬁned as "proneural" by their transcriptional proﬁle (36). These tumors are characterized by expression of
typical markers of neural differentiation and have better
prognosis than other molecularly deﬁned subtypes. In contrast, both ﬁbulin-3 and its close homologue ﬁbulin-4 are
expressed at much higher levels in "mesenchymal" gliomas
than proneural tumors (Supplementary Fig. S7). The mesenchymal subtype can be clearly differentiated from proneural gliomas by its molecular signature and is characterized by increased angiogenesis and poorer prognosis. It is
tempting to speculate whether increased expression of
ﬁbulins may upregulate Notch signaling in the tumor or its
microenvironment (e.g., blood vessels) and contribute to
tumor progression toward the more aggressive mesenchymal phenotype, which is also the predominant phenotype
upon recurrence (36).
In conclusion, our results highlight ﬁbulin-3 as an
upstream marker of Notch signaling in gliomas and a novel
Notch activator increasing tumor cell self-renewal, chemoresistance, invasion, and tumor growth. This evidence of Notch
regulation by the tumor microenvironment opens a way to
potential strategies for targeting this pathway more efﬁciently. Targeting ﬁbulin-3 as part of anti-Notch strategies
could restrict anti-invasive and chemosensitizing effects to
the tumor cells without the pleiotropic effects of current
pharmacologic inhibitors.
