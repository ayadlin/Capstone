Cancers emerge from an on-going Darwinian evolutionary process, often leading to multiple
competing subclones within a single primary tumour1-4. This evolutionary process culminates in
the formation of metastases, which is the cause of 90% of cancer-related deaths5. However,
despite its clinical importance, little is known about the principles governing the dissemination of
cancer cells to distant organs. Although the hypothesis that each metastasis originates from a
single tumour cell is generally supported6-8, recent studies using mouse models of cancer
demonstrated the existence of polyclonal seeding from and inter-clonal cooperation between
multiple subclones9,10. In this study, we sought definitive evidence for the existence of polyclonal
seeding in human malignancy and to establish the clonal relationship among different metastases
in the context of androgen-deprived metastatic prostate cancer. Using whole genome sequencing,
we characterised multiple metastases arising from prostate tumours in ten patients. Integrated
analyses of subclonal architecture revealed the patterns of metastatic spread in unprecedented
detail. Metastasis-to-metastasis spread was found to be common, either through de novo
monoclonal seeding of daughter metastases or, in five cases, through the transfer of multiple
tumour clones between metastatic sites. Lesions affecting tumour suppressor genes usually occur
as single events, whereas mutations in genes involved in androgen receptor signalling commonly
involve multiple, convergent events in different metastases. Our results elucidate in detail the
complex patterns of metastatic spread and further our understanding of the development of
resistance to androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.

To characterise the subclonal architecture of androgen-deprived metastatic prostate cancer,
we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 51 tumours from 10 patients to an
average sequencing depth of 55X, including multiple metastases from different anatomic
sites in each patient and, in 5 cases, the prostate tumour (Supplementary Table 1). We
identified a set of high-confidence substitutions, insertions/deletions, genomic
rearrangements and copy number changes present in each tumour sample (Extended Data
Figure 1 and Supplementary Information, Section 3). To portray the populations of tumour
cells within each patient, we employed an n-dimensional Bayesian Dirichlet process to
group clonal and subclonal mutations, i.e. those mutations present in all or a fraction of
tumour cells within a sample, respectively. The fraction of tumour cells carrying each
mutation was calculated from the mutant allele fraction, taking into account the tumour
purity and local copy number state, as described previously2,11. Each of the mutations
assigned to a single cluster is present in a fixed proportion of cells in each sample and hence
belongs to a separate subclone, i.e. a genetically distinct population of cells.
By plotting the cancer cell fractions of mutations from pairs of samples, we determined the
clonal relationship between the constituent subclones and found evidence for polyclonal
seeding of metastases, the most striking example of which is seen in patient A22 (Figure 1).
Each of the plots in Figure 1a contains a cluster of mutations at (1,1), indicative of truncal
mutations that were present in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of both
metastases. However, in many of the plots, there are additional clusters at subclonal
proportions in both samples plotted. For example, the cluster of mutations indicated by the
purple circles in Figure 1a are present in 40% of cells in A22-G, 62% of cells in A22-H,
37% of cells in A22-J and 92% of cells in A22-K. A metastasis seeded by a single cell must
carry a set of mutations present in all tumour cells, representing the complement of lesions

in that founding cell. In some cases, this set of mutations will be subclonal in the originating
site. However, mutation clusters present subclonally in two or more samples can only occur
as the result of multiple seeding events by two or more genotypically distinct cells. A
graphic illustration of the clonal and subclonal clusters and their representation in all of the
10 samples from A22 is shown in Figure 1b. Where one subclone is present in the same or a
lower fraction of cells than a second subclone in all samples, the subclones are represented
as nested ovals when required by the pigeonhole principle (Supplementary Information,
Section 4b). In contrast, clusters whose relative cancer cell fractions are reversed in different
samples represent branching subclones and are shown as disjoint ovals. The full lineage
relationship between the subclones can be depicted in the form of a phylogenetic tree whose
branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions in the corresponding subclone
(Figure 1c).
In 5/10 cases (A34, A22, A31, A32, A24), we found clusters of mutations present
subclonally across multiple metastases, suggesting that polyclonal seeding between different
organ sites is a common occurrence in metastatic prostate cancer (Figure 2). Mutations
selected from these clusters (181-429 mutations per patient) were validated by deep
sequencing (median coverage 471X) of additional aliquots of DNA from each WGS sample
and extra metastatic and/or prostate samples, confirming these findings (Extended Data
Figures 2-7, Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Information, Section 4e).

Analysis of known driver events found in the subclones provides important insights into
polyclonal spread of prostate cancer during therapy. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is
the standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer and initially induces tumour regression in
most patients. However, ADT inevitably results in castration-resistance through various
mechanisms, including androgen receptor (AR) amplification, increased AR sensitivity as a
result of mutation, AR phosphorylation and bypass of the AR pathway12,13. It is currently
unknown whether castration resistance is generally acquired via a single event or more
commonly appears in multiple cells independently. Two of the subclones implicated with
polyclonal seeding in A22 carry different oncogenic alterations associated with ADT
resistance, suggesting that clonal expansion has been driven by distinct resistance
mechanisms: MYC amplification14 in the purple cluster and a pathogenic AR substitution15
in the mid blue cluster. Overall, in all five patients with polyclonal seeding, subclones
carrying either alterations in AR or genes involved in AR signalling (such as FOXA1), or
alternative mechanisms of castration resistance such as MYC amplification and CTNNB1
mutation16, were found to have re-seeded multiple sites. This suggests that the tumour cell
populations with a significant survival advantage are not confined within the boundaries of
an organ site but can successfully spread to and reseed other sites (Figure 2).
Precise relationships between metastatic sites reveal the patterns of metastasis-tometastasis
seeding. In all 7 cases for which the prostate tumour was sequenced (A10, A22, A29, A31
and A32; by targeted deep sequencing in A21 and A34), multiple metastases were more
closely related to each other than any of them were to the primary tumour (Figure 2;
Extended Data Figures 2-5 and 7; Supplementary Information, Section 4e). In the 5 cases
with polyclonal seeding, this relationship resulted from multiple subclones shared
subclonally by different metastases, raising the possibility of interclonal co-operativity, in

agreement with recent studies using mouse models10,17, or remodelling of metastatic niches
by initial colonising prostate cancer clones, making them attractive habitats that other clones
can colonise later18. Further, for those patients where multiple metastases from the same
tissue type were analysed (A22, A34, A21), metastases located in the same tissue are more
closely related than those in different tissues, as previously observed in pancreatic cancer19.
Intriguingly, samples within close physical proximity were often more similar to each other
than to more distant samples. This raises the question whether the similarity between
metastases in the same tissue type arises as a result of geographical proximity or from tissuespecific seeding.

In order to explore further the relationships between samples, we considered the order of
acquisition of mutations. Starting from the MRCA, we observe the accumulation of
additional clusters of mutations representing subsequent ‘selective sweeps’20. Phylogenetic
trees give clear pictures of the order of events, allowing the creation of ‘body maps’ that
represent emergence and movement of clones from one site to another (Figure 3). The
observed representation of subclones across different sites may be explained by two
different patterns of spread: linear and branching. A22 demonstrates both patterns (Figure
3a). The red and light green subclones are present in all metastases and indicate linear
spread from the prostate to the seminal vesicle and thence to the remaining metastases. The
remaining inter-site subclones have a more complex pattern demonstrating the emergence of
branching lineages, each with demonstrated metastasis-to-metastasis seeding. The stepwise
accumulation of clonal mutations in A21, on the other hand, displays a simple linear pattern
of metastasis-to-metastasis spread (Figure 3b). Finally, in A24, a period of sequential
metastasis-to-metastasis spread was followed by parallel polyclonal spread of subclones
between multiple metastases (Figure 3c). Overall, these patterns of seeding from one
metastasis to the next are seen in 8 of the 10 patients (all but A12 and A29). We cannot
formally exclude an alternative explanation for the observed patterns, that each of these
metastases has seeded from an undetected subclone in the primary tumour. However,
targeted re-sequencing of a subset of mutations failed to detect any such subclones, despite a
median sequencing depth of 471X (Supplementary Information, Section 4e).
Mutations found subclonally in the prostate tumour but clonally in all metastases expose the
metastasizing subclone in four cases: A22, A29, A31 and A32. In each of these patients,
phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that the metastases are derived from a minor subclone,
encompassing <50% of tumour cells. In three cases (A32, A10 and A34), more than one
subclone from the primary tumour was involved in seeding of metastases, indicating that
multiple subclones achieved metastatic potential (Supplementary Information, section 4e).
In the case of A31 and A32, driver alterations that could confer selective advantage on the
metastasising subclone(s) were identified (Figure 2). In A32, both copies of TP53 as well as
one copy of PTEN, RB1 and CDKN1B21 were inactivated early in tumour evolution (Figure
2). Additional aberrations occurred separately in the purple and mid blue subclones to
achieve homozygous inactivation of these tumour suppressor genes via independent
mechanisms (Supplementary Information, section 4e). In A31, a PPP2R5A deletion and an
AR duplication occurred in the metastasising subclones (purple or orange) while,
interestingly, the pink cluster, displaying many important oncogenic alterations including

events affecting TP53 and MLL3, showed no evidence of metastatic spread (Figure 2,

Annotation of oncogenic/putative oncogenic alterations (Supplementary Information,
section 4c; Supplementary Table 2; Extended Data Table 2) on the phylogenetic trees
provides some insight into the sequence of oncogenic events that take place during
metastatic progression under ADT. The tumour cells in each patient share a common clonal
origin (Figure 2, grey clusters). In all patients but one (A34), this mother clone represents
the largest cluster of mutations (range 40-90% of all mutations) and contains the majority of
driver mutations (Figures 2 and 4a-b) similar to previous observations in pancreatic
cancer22. In contrast, oncogenic alterations disrupting genes important for AR signalling
were rarely on the trunk. All patients had at least one alteration directly affecting the AR
locus or genes involved in AR signalling, with widespread heterogeneity and convergent
evolution observed across multiple samples from the same patient.

In the great majority of cases, aberrations in AR signalling seem to have occurred after
metastatic spread, although A21 and A24 are exceptions. The former has a large tandem
duplication including the AR locus present in all samples, suggesting this was an early event.
The latter harbours a truncal T878A mutation, which was also detected in two additional
metastases (A24-F and A24-G, interrogated by targeted sequencing). Interestingly, though, a
series of complex rearrangements between chromosomes 2 and X resulting in AR
amplification was not detected in these samples (Figure 4c). Since such amplification is
selected for by ADT23, it is likely that spread from the falciform ligament (A24-G) to the
right axillary lymph node (A24-A) took place after ADT, which commenced 2 years and 9
months prior to death (Figure 3c). Across the whole cohort, only one out of 17 AR
amplifications was truncal, with the remainder present only in a subset of metastases.
Furthermore, in five patients, copy number had increased on more than one occasion within
the same sample (Figure 4c and Extended Data Figure 8) implying continuous selective
pressure on the AR pathway, in line with recent reports of persistent AR signalling in
castration resistant prostate cancer15.
Our analyses allow us to view with unprecedented clarity the genomic evolution of
metastatic prostate cancer, from initial tumorigenesis through the acquisition of metastatic
potential to the development of castration resistance. A picture emerges of a diaspora of
tumour cells, sharing a common heritage, spreading from one site to another, while retaining
the genetic imprint of their ancestors. After a long period of development prior to the most
recent complete selective sweep, metastasis usually occurs in the form of spread between
distant sites, rather than as separate waves of invasion directly from the primary tumour.
This observation supports the ‘seed and soil’ hypothesis in which rare subclones develop
metastatic potential within the primary tumour7, rather than the theory that metastatic
potential is a property of the primary tumour as a whole24,25. Transit of cells from one host
site to another is relatively common, either as monoclonal metastasis-tometastasis seeding or
as polyclonal seeding. Clonal diversification occurs within the constraining necessity to
bypass ADT, driving distinct subclones towards a convergent path of therapeutic resistance.
However, the resulting resistant subclones are not constrained to a single host site. Rather, a

subclones were identified. The subsets of samples in which validated substitutions, indels
and rearrangements are found correlate strongly with the subclonal clusters identified from
the clustering of substitutions from WGS, providing support for the existence of these
subclones. For each patient, hierarchical clustering of the variant allele fraction (VAF) was
performed separately for substitutions (a) and indels (b). VAFs are represented as a heatmap
with deeper shades of red indicating a higher proportion of reads reporting the mutant allele.
Above each heatmap, mutations are colour-coded according to the subclone they were

Validation of mutation calling
To determine validation rate for mutation calling, a custom capture SureSelect design was
used to sequence selected coding/non-coding loci to an average depth of 360-2000X. For
loci with sufficient depth (>=20X), the validation rate (the proportion of somatic variants)
was calculated as described in Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Information,
section 3c. On average 95% and 86% of the substitutions and indels, respectively, were
somatic. Validation for rearrangement calls was performed by PCR-gel electrophoresis, as
described in Supplementary Information, section 3d. PCR-gel experiments yielded a high
validation rate for three of the four patients included in the validation. For A22, there was a
high rate of PCR failure. For this sample, we therefore assessed the veracity of the
breakpoints by visual inspection of the associated copy number segments and confirmed that
82% were high-confidence events resulting in visible copy number changes.

Copy number genes

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To identify potentially oncogenic events within regions of copy number changes, we
intersected the affected genomic segments with genes previously shown to be recurrently
amplified/deleted. The ‘Source’ column indicates the literature source of the gene as
follows: pan_cancer = The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer data set (Zach,
2013), prostate = reports of genes specifically amplified/deleted in prostate cancer (Taylor,
2010 and Barbieri, 2012), cancer_gene_census = Cancer gene census (Futreal, 2004),
literature = widely reported in cancer literature.

Figure 1. n-D Dirichlet process clustering reveals widespread polyclonal seeding in A22

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

(a) For pairs of metastases, cancer cell fractions (CCF), i.e. the fraction of cells within a
sample containing a mutation, are plotted for all the substitutions detected in the WGS data.
Red density areas off the axes and with CCF >0 and <1 reveal the existence of mutation
clusters present at subclonal levels in more than one metastatic site. Mutation clusters for
each sample are indicated with circles coloured according to the subclone they correspond to
(Supplementary Table 3). The centre of each circle is positioned at the CCF values of the
subclone in the two samples. The clusters at (1,1) correspond to the mutations present in all
the cells in both sites (CCF=1) while those on axes refer to sample-specific subclones. For
example, light blue and dark green clusters absent from sample A are positioned on the yaxis when H is compared to A but are moved to (0.60,0.08) and (0.60,0.88) when H is
compared to K. (b) Each subclone detected in A22 is represented as a set of colour-coded
ovals across all organ sites (Supplementary Table 3). Each row represents a sample, with
ovals in the far left column nested if required by the pigeonhole principle (SI). The area of
the ovals is proportional to the CCF of the corresponding subclone. Subclonal mutation
clusters are shown with solid borders. Oval plots are divided into three types: trunk (CCF=1
in all samples), leaf (specific to a single sample) and branch (present in >1 sample and either
not found in all samples or subclonal in at least one). (c) Phylogenetic tree showing the
relationships between subclones in A22. Branch lengths are proportional to the number of
substitutions in each cluster. Branches are annotated with samples in which they are present
and with oncogenic/putative oncogenic alterations assigned to that subclone (LOH: Loss of
Heterozygosity). (d) Subclone colour key.

Figure 2. Subclonal structure within 10 metastatic lethal prostate cancers

All the subclones identified in the whole genome sequenced samples are shown as
phylogenetic trees and oval plots (as described in Figure 1). Patients with polyclonal seeding
(A34, A22, A31, A32 and A24) are on the right (amp: amplification).

Figure 3. Metastasis-to-metastasis seeding occurs either by a linear or a branching pattern of
spread

Body maps show the seeding of all tumour sites from (a) A22, (b) A21 and (c) A24. Sites
shown include samples subject to targeted sequencing (A22-L, A24-F, A24-G) in addition to
WGS samples. Seeding events are represented with arrows colour-coded according to
Supplementary Table 3 and with double-heads when seeding could be in either direction.
When the sequence of events may be ordered from the acquisition of mutations, arrows are
numbered chronologically. Subclones on branching clonal lineages are labelled with the
same number but with different letters, e.g. 4a & 4b. See Supplementary Information
Section 4e for a detailed discussion of the body map in these cases.

oncogenic alterations present on the trunk (top) or off the trunk, i.e. on branches or leaves
(bottom). Alterations in oncogenes and tumour suppressors are shown in red and blue,
respectively, with shade indicating the number of events in that patient. Focal deletions and
substitutions/indels are shown with crosses and stars, respectively. Double crosses indicate
homozygous deletions resulting from deletions of both alleles. (c) Continuous selective
pressure on AR signalling is observed in the form of multiple rearrangements resulting in
multiple copy number increases at the AR locus within the same patient. Chromosomal
rearrangements are plotted on top of the genome-wide copy number for each of the 4 WGS
samples from A24. Rearrangements are coloured according to the colour code in
Supplementary Table 3. Arcs above and below the top vertical line indicate deletion and
tandem duplication events, while arcs above and below the second vertical line are head-tohead and tail-to-tail inversions, respectively.
