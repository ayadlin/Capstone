ABSTRACT
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the world.
In addressing the need of treatments for relapsed disease, we report the identification
of an existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved small-molecule drug
to repurpose for GC treatment. Auranofin (AF), clinically used to treat rheumatic
arthritis, but it exhibited preclinical efficacy in GC cells. By increasing intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, AF induces a lethal endoplasmic reticulum
stress response and mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured GC cells. Blockage of ROS
production reversed AF-induced ER stress and mitochondrial pathways activation as
well as apoptosis. In addition, AF displays synergistic lethality with an ROS-generating
agent piperlongumine, which is a natural product isolated from the long pepper
Piper longum L. Taken together, this work provides a novel anticancer candidate
for the treatment of gastric cancer. More importantly, it reveals that increased ROS
generation might be an effective strategy in treating human gastric cancer.

highlights the urgent need for novel effective and less
toxic therapeutic approaches [4, 5]. Therefore, novel
effective and safe treatments need to be developed and
tested. Thus, repurposing of an existing U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small-molecule
drug in the treatment of gastric cancer is a worthy goal [6].
Compared with normal cells, cancer cells have
intrinsically higher levels of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and are under oxidative stress due to an
imbalanced redox status [7]. Elevated ROS levels also
render cancer cells more sensitive to agents that further
increase ROS and oxidative stress [8, 9]. Auranofin (AF)
is a metal phosphine complex that has been used for
the clinical treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, following
the pioneering studies conducted with gold (I) thiolate

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause
of cancer-related deaths in the world and is clinically
challenging, especially in East Asia [1]. Current treatment
modalities for GC include surgery, radiotherapy,
chemotherapy, and their combinations. Although surgery
is the main treatment for curing gastric cancer, adjuvant
or perioperative chemotherapy and molecule-targeted
chemotherapy have been prescribed for gastric cancer,
due to their marked benefits in reducing disease recurrence
and increasing long-term survival [2, 3]. However, severe
side effects and complications such as hematological
and gastrointestinal toxicities of current anticancer drugs
become major problems in the clinical setting, which

AF induced apoptosis in human gastric
cancer cells

compounds [10]. Previous studies suggested that AF
acted as an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase, which
could cause the oxidative damage and modifications of
cellular redox status, resulting in over production of ROS
and apoptosis [11, 12]. AF can exert a strong cytotoxic
effect on several different types of neoplastic cells both
in vitro and in vivo [13, 14]. The cytotoxic activity of
AF along with its relative safe profile in patients warrants
the application potential of AF in cancer therapy and
other diseases [15]. AF is currently in clinical trials for
the treatment of leukemia, recurrent ovarian epithelial
cancer and recurrent non-small cell lung carcinoma
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01419691,
NCT01747798, NCT01737502). Although it has been
tested in several types of human malignancies, AF has
not yet been tested in GC.
In this study, we showed that AF could induce
GC cells apoptosis via activating ROS-dependent ER
stress and mitochondrial pathways, blockage of ROS
production by specific inhibitor totally abolished the
anti-cancer effects of AF. Moreover, we evaluated
the synergistic inhibitory effect of AF in GC cells
with Piperlongumin (PL), which is a natural product
isolated from the long pepper Piper longum L that was
recently identified as selectively toxic to cancer cells
in ROS-dependent manner [16, 17]. The mechanistic
investigation elucidated that PL as a ROS inducer could
dramatically enhance AF-induced GC cells apoptosis in
vitro and in vivo by triggering ROS-mediated ER stress
pathway. Our study indicates that ROS production could
be an important target for developing new anti-cancer
drugs.

We further examined the pro-apoptosis effect of AF
on human gastric cancer cells using Annexin V/Propidium
Iodide (PI) staining assay. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B,
all of three gastric cancer cell lines have shown a
concentration-dependent apoptosis after a 24 h treatment
with AF. Then we determined the levels of apoptosisrelated proteins in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells treated
with AF. Figure 2C showed that treatment with AF for 20 h
dose-dependently activated caspase-3/PARP pathway and
increased the level of cleaved caspase-3/PARP, suggesting
that AF-induced apoptosis may be associated to caspase-3/
PARP pathway activation.

ROS generation is the regulator of AF-induced
apoptosis
It was believed that AF could induce ROS-mediated
apoptosis by inhibiting TrxR1 activity [11]. Therefore, we
determined the roles of ROS in AF-induced cytotoxicity
in human gastric cancer cells. As shown in Figure 3A–3F,
treatment with AF for 2 h in BGC-823 and SGC-7901
cells caused a significantly increase in DCF-reactive ROS.
Pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC,
5 mM) completely inhibited AF-mediated ROS induction.
In addition, we found that NAC almost completely
abolished BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells apoptosis induced
by AF (Figure 4A–4C). Similar results were observed
in the caspase-3 activity assay (Figure 4D–4E). We
also found that pretreatment with catalase (2000 U/mL)
for 2 h significantly abolished SGC-7901 cells death
induced by AF (Figure 4F). However, pretreatment with
Mito-Tempo (a mitochondria-specific antioxidant) for
2 h failed to protect cells against AF-induced cell death,
suggesting that mitochondrial ROS was not involved in
the event of AF-mediated cell death (Figure 4G).

RESULTS
AF causes loss of viability of human gastric
cancer cells
To investigate the effect of AF on the growth of
human gastric cancer cells, BGC-823, SGC-7901 and
KATO III cells were treated with AF in vitro for 24 hours
and cell viability was detected by the MTT assay. As
shown in Figure 1A, AF dose-dependently decreased
the cell viability in BGC-823, SGC-7901 and KATO III
cells with IC50 values of 2.3, 1.8 and 2.7 μM, respectively.
By contrast, only a small percentage of cell death was
found in normal cells after treated with 5 μM AF for 24 h.
However, at the highest dose of 20 μM, AF treatment
suppressed the growth of normal cells (Figure 1B).
Further, morphological changes were determined using
Hoechst 33258 staining in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells.
Figure 1C revealed that treatment with AF resulted in a
dose-dependent increase in the number of apoptotic cells,
and exhibited significant apoptotic characteristics such as
nuclear condensation and fragmentation.

AF-induced ROS increases ER stress and
mitochondrial dysfunction, which contributes to
AF lethality in gastric cancer cells
Increased ROS levels and perturbation in
the intracellular redox status increase the levels of
unfolded proteins in the ER and induce ER stress
response [18, 19]. UPR induces PERK-mediated
phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2α, which
blocks cap-dependent protein translation but allows
preferential translation of ATF4. While upregulating
chaperone proteins, for example, GRP78, required
in restoring the ER function, ATF4 also induces the
prodeath transcriptional regulator CHOP [20, 21]. Thus,
we next examined the expressions of ER stress-related
proteins, such as p-PERK, p-eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP in

AF-treated gastric cancer cells. The time-course result
indicated that AF (4 μM) could significantly activate ER
stress. The expression levels of p-PERK, p-eIF2α and
ATF4 reached the peak at 3–6 h after treatment, and
CHOP peaked after 12 h treatment in BGC-823 cells
(Figure 5A). Similar results were observed in SGC-7901
cells (Figure 5B). In order to further confirm that ER
stress plays an important role in the induction of gastric
cancer cells apoptosis by AF, CHOP expression was
downregulated by CHOP siRNA. As shown in Figure
5C–5D, knockdown of CHOP by siRNA, markedly
attenuated AF-induced apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells. In
addition, we found that pretreatment with the antioxidant
NAC completely blocked the expression of p-eIF2α,
ATF4 and CHOP in AF-treated BGC-823 and SGC-7901
cells (Figure 5E and 5F), and totally inhibited apoptosis
of gastric cancer cells, as shown above in Figure 4A.
These findings demonstrate that AF-induced ROS could

in the expression of p-PERK, p-eIF2α, ATF4 and CHOP
in gastric cancer cells.
It is well known that mitochondria are central to
the regulation of apoptosis [22]. Excessive generation
of ROS renders the cells oxidatively stressed
and impairs membrane proteins, leading to mitochondrial
dysfunction. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
(Δψm) is catastrophic for cells and leads to the release
of cytochrome C into the cytosol [23]. Therefore,
fluorescence microscope analysis was used to
confirm  whether AF treatment-induced apoptosis
occurred through destroying mitochondrial homeostasis
using JC-1 as a molecular probe. As shown in
Figure 6A, the integrity of mitochondrial membranes
potential was decreased in SGC-7901 cells after AF
treatment as evidenced by the elevation of green
fluorescence from the red to green. The release of
cytochrome C to the cytoplasm and caspase 9 activity
were both elevated in SGC-7901 cells (Figure 6B–6D).

The imbalance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins would lead to the loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential and finally result in the induction
of apoptosis. Hence, it was of interest to identify the
Bcl-2 family members involved in the AF treatmentinduced apoptosis. As shown in Figure 6E, treatment
with AF remarkably decreased the expression of Bcl-2,
bur increased the expression of Bax in SGC-7901 cells.
In addition, pre-incubation with NAC attenuated these
effects confirming their linkage to AF-induced oxidative
stress (Figure 6A–6E). Collectively these results
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

indicated that AF treatment induced ROS-dependent
mitochondrial apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.

PL enhances AF-induced cell apoptosis by
elevating intracellular ROS levels and ER stress
PL is reported to produce ROS as a major of its
anticancer mechanisms [16, 17]. Our research found
that AF could induce gastric cancer cells apoptosis
through ROS-mediated oxidative damage. Hence, we
asked whether PL could enhance the ROS accumulation

the increases in the levels of ROS and nitric oxide
induced by combined treatment (Figure 7C and 7D).
Abundant intracellular ROS may cause DNA damage and
activate down-streamed signaling pathway. Therefore,
it was interested to investigate whether the ER-stress
pathway was activated by combined treatment. As
shown in Figure 7E, treatment of cell with AF and PL
alone both slightly induced the expressions of p-eIF2α
and ATF4. However, AF and PL in combination
dramatically activated ER-stress pathway, as convinced
by significantly enhanced expressions of p-eIF2α, ATF4,
and CHOP. In additon, NAC pretreatment completely
blocked the combined treatment-induced overexpression
of CHOP in SGC-7901 cells (Figure 7F).
To determine the combined effects of PL and AF,
Annexin V/PI double staining detected by flow cytometry
was employed to evaluate combined treatment-induced
cell apoptosis. As shown in Figure 8A, compared with
AF alone, cells treated with PL combination showed
significant enhancement in apoptosis. This finding was
further confirmed by cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP.
As shown in Figure 8C, combination of AF and PL
resulted in increased activation of caspase-3, together
with increased cleavage of PARP in SGC-7901 cancer
cells. In addition, AF and PL cotreatment significantly
suppressed the expression level of anti-apoptotic protein
Bcl-2 (Figure 8C). To confirm whether ROS accumulation
is a necessary event in the potentiated apoptosis, two
ROS scavenger, GSH and NAC were induced in our
experiment. The results revealed that scavenging of ROS
nearly reversed all the detected effects induced by the
combined treatment, including the cleaving of caspase-3
and PARP (Figure 8B and 8D). Inhibition of Bcl-2 was
also reversed (Figure 8D). These results revealed the vital
role of ROS in the synergism. The redox system might
be the upstream target for PL to enhance the apoptosis
induced by AF in gastric cancer cells.

together, these results all indicated that PL can synergizes
the therapeutic effect of AF in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Drug ‘repurposing’ is the identification of new
therapeutic applications for drugs that have received US
FDA approval for another purpose. Due to the reduced
length and cost of research and trial phases, drug
repurposing is more affordable and achievable than novel
drug discovery [24]. Auranofin is a drug that is approved
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Recently,
treatment with AF was discovered to inhibit TrxR and
induce ROS in cancer cells, which was associated with
high in vitro and in vivo potency of AF against cancer
cells [11, 25]. With the goal of potential repurposing AF
for the treatment of gastric cancer, our preclinical studies
presented here demonstrate that AF could induce ROS
in the gastric cancer cells. Here, we also showed for the
first time that treatment with AF was linked to and could
induce lethal oxidative, ER stress-based UPR responses
and mitochondrial dysfunction in gastric cancer cells.
Furthermore, Co-treatment with NAC fully reversed the
AF-induced increase in ROS and cell death, served to
reinforce the role of ROS as an effector.
ROS plays a crucial role in the processes of tumor
genesis, progression, and metastasis. Cancer cells usually
possess higher levels of ROS and higher antioxidant
activities in an uncontrolled status as compared to normal
cells [26]. As a result, cancer cells are unable to cope
with additional oxidative stress and become vulnerable
to ROS [7, 27]. Therefore, targeting ROS is an important
therapeutic strategy for cancer as exemplified by cancer
drugs such as daunorubicin [28], cisplatin [29], paclitaxel
[30], and trisenox [31]. Exploring the mechanisms of
ROS based treatment is required for further improving the
efficacy and specificity of cancer drugs.
In response to oxidative stress mediated by ROS,
accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins triggers
a cellular adaptive procedure known as ER stress [20].
Normally, ER stress is designed to be protective by
mediating the shutdown of general protein synthesis and
by increasing the production of molecular chaperones,
including the ER resident hsp70 homologue, glucoseregulated protein 78 (GRP78) [21]. However, if ER stress
is protracted, lethal ER stress ensues through prolonged
activation of the pro-death ER stress pathways mediated
by CHOP (CAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous
protein) [32]. Our findings showed p-PERK, p-eIF2α and
ATF4 were induced in a time-dependent manner after
AF stimulation, suggesting that ER stress is activated at
3–6 h after AF treatment. These initiations of ER stress
apoptotic pathway have been reported to increase CHOP
gene expression, triggering ER stress-specific cascade
for implementation of apoptosis. Consequently, the
up-regulation of CHOP protein expression was observed

PL amplifies the therapeutic effect of AF in vivo
To evaluate the synergetic effect of AF and PL
in vivo, immuno-deficient nude mice bearing SGC7901 tumor xenografts were employed to investigate
the therapeutic effect of AF in combination with PL. As
expected, after 14 days’ administration, treatment of AF
and PL alone both inhibited SGC-7901 tumor xenografts
growth. However, SGC-7901 tumor xenografts growth in
nude mice was more effectively inhibited by the combined
treatment with AF and PL. For instance, combined
treatment with AF and PL significantly inhibited the tumor
volume (Figure 9A and 9B) and tumor weight (Figure 9C),
but not affected body weight of mice (Figure 9D). The
in vivo mechanistic studies revealed that combined
treatment inhibited tumor xenografts by induction of
caspase activation and CHOP expression (Figure 9E),
which were consistent with the results in vitro. Taken

in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells after AF treatment for
6–12 h. Furthermore, we found that AF-induced activation
of ER stress was almost completely blocked by NAC,
indicating that ROS production is the upstream regulator
of AF-induced ER stress in gastric cancer cells.
Recently, combined (rather than single-agent)
chemotherapy has been found to be a superior
treatment strategy [33]. Hence, searching of effective
chemosensitizers that could augment the efficiency of
anticancer drugs and simultaneously overcome multidrug resistance and side effects is urgently needed
[34, 35]. Piperlongumine (PL) is a naturally occurring
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

small molecule recently identified to be toxic selectively
to cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [16]. This compound
was found to elevate cellular levels of reactive oxygen
species selectively in cancer cell lines [16, 36]. Therefore,
we assessed the synergistic effects of PL and AF. The
present study to show that PL potentiates the cytotoxic
effect of AF in gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
PL induced a robust increase in AF-mediated apoptosis
via ROS-mediated ER-stress activation. To further
characterize the importance of ROS in combined
treatment, two antioxidants, GSH and NAC were
employed. As anticipated, addition of GSH and NAC

completely attenuated combined treatment-induced cell
growth inhibition against SGC-7901 cells. Furthermore,
both reduced PARP and caspase-3 cleavage detected by
western blotting confirmed this protective effect of NAC
and GSH. Therefore, based on these results, we proposed
that PL enhanced AF-induced gastric cancer cell apoptosis
by ROS overproduction.
The present study demonstrates that PL can act
as a ROS inducer agent to enhance AF-induced human
gastric cancer cell killing and apoptosis through ROSmediated ER-stress and mitochondrial dysfunction
pathways. It is reported that AF could bind to the
SeC-containing C-terminal and the N-terminal redox
center to inhibit TrxR activity [37], and PL probably
directly binds to and inhibits the antioxidant enzyme
glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) and carbonyl
reductase 1 (CBR1), resulting in elevated levels of ROS
and subsequent cancer-selective cell death [16, 17].
We speculate the possibility that PL inhibits GSTP1 or
CBR1 activity and caused ROS accumulation, which in
turn oxidized intracellular thiol-containing antioxidant
agents like GSH and Trx, thus sensitized the cancer cells
to AF-induced apoptosis. Further studies are necessary
to comfirm the hypothesis. This finding predicts that PL
has promising implications in improving the therapeutic
efficacy when combining with other anticancer drugs in
clinic.
In summary, we here investigated the antiproliferative effects and mechanisms of AF, a FDAapproved small-molecule drug, in gastric cancer
cell lines. We found that AF treatment resulted in
severe ROS accumulation, excessive ROS caused the
activation of ER stress and mitochondrial apoptotic
pathways. We also demonstrated the synergistic
effect of PL/AF combination on suppression of tumor
growth in vivo using a xenograft tumor model. The
suppression of apoptosis by NAC validates the critical
role of ROS in combined treatment-induced cell death.
Figure 10 showed a proposed signaling model leading
to development of ROS-induced cell death induced by
AF and PL. Our results suggested that combining low
dose of PL with AF can serve as a potential combination
therapy for the treatment of human gastric cancer. In
addition, we also demonstrated that ROS production
could be an important target for the development of new
anti-cancer drugs.

was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with 1640 medium to
final concentrations of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 μM.
The tumor cells were incubated with AF for 24 h before
the MTT assay.

Hoechst 33258 staining
At 12 h after AF (2, 3 or 4 μM) treatment, cells
were fixed, washed twice with PBS and stained with
Hoechst 33258 staining solution according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Hoechst Staining Kit,
Beyotime Biotechnology, China). Apoptotic features of
cell death were determined by the staining of cell nuclei
with the DNA-binding fluorochrome H33258 assessing
chromatin condensation by using fluorescence microscope
(Nikon, Japan) with 20X amplification. In each group,
five microscopic fields were selected randomly.

Measurement of reactive oxygen species
generation
Cellular ROS contents were measured by flow
cytometry as described previously [19]. Briefly,
5 × 105 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes, allowed to
attach overnight, and exposed to AF for 2 h. Cells were
stained with 10 μM DCFH-DA or 5 μM DAF-FM-DA
(Beyotime Biotech, Nantong, China) at 37°C for 30 min.
Cells were collected and the fluorescence was analyzed
using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
CA). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with
5 mM NAC or 5 mM GSH for 2 h prior exposure to
compounds and analysis of ROS generation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Auranofin (Santa Cruz, CA) and Piperlongumine
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were suspended in dimethyl
sulfoxide and stored in volumes of 1 mL at –20°C.

Cell apoptosis analysis

samples were electrophoresed and then transferred to
poly-vinylidene difluoride transfer membranes. The blots
were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with fresh 5%
nonfat milk in TBST and then incubated with specific
primary antibody in TBST overnight at 4°C. Following
three washes with TBST, the blots were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
for 1 h, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized
by using ECL kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The density
of the immunoreactive bands was analyzed using Image
J computer software (National Institute of Health, MD).

SGC-7901, BGC-823 and KATO III cells were
plated on 60-mm dishes for 12 h, and then treated with
AF (2, 3 or 4 μM) for 24 h. Cells were then harvested,
washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and evaluated for
apoptosis by double staining with FITC conjugated
Annexin V and Propidium Iodide (PI) in binding
buffer for 30 min using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, CA).

Western blot analysis

Determination of caspase-3/9 activity

Cells or tumor tissues were homogenized in
protein lysate buffer, and debris was removed by
centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The
protein concentrations in all samples were determined by
using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). After addition of sample loading buffer, protein

Caspase-3/9 activity in cell lysates was determined
using a Caspase-3/9 activity kit (Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology, Nantong, China) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. The caspase-3/9 activity
was normalized by the protein concentration of the

intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 4 mg/kg PL once per
day, or by i.p. injection of 2 mg/kg AF once per day, or
with a combination of PL and AF according to the same
schedules. The tumor volumes were determined by
measuring length (l) and width (w) and calculating volume
(V = 0.5 × l × w2) at the indicated time points. At the end
of treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the tumors
were removed and weighed for use in proteins expression
studies.

Transient transfection of small interfering RNA
(siRNA)
The sequences for the CHOP siRNA construct were
described previously [19]. SGC-7901 cells (3 × 105/well)
were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h, and
then were transfected with siRNA duplexes against human
CHOP (100 nM) or control siRNA by lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Forty-eight hours posttransduction, the cells were washed
with complete media and plated with or without AF for
24 hours for assessing apoptosis.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were assayed in triplicate (n = 3).
Data are expressed as means ± SEM. All statistical
analyses were performed using GraphPad Pro. Prism
5.0 (GraphPad, SanDiego, CA). Student’s t-test and
two-way ANOVA were employed to analyze the
differences between sets of data. A p value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential
(Δψm) and Cytochrome C release
The effects of AF on the cell mitochondrial
membrane potential (Δψm) were examined by fluorescence
microscope using JC-1 (Beyotime Biotech, Nantong,
China) as specific probe. Cells were treated with AF for
14 h and stained with JC-1 in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 at 37°C for 30 minutes. Images acquired from
monomer and aggregate were merged and viewed under
the Nikon fluorescence microscope (40X amplification,
Nikon, Japan). Evaluation of the sub-cellular localization
of cytochrome C was done by using fluorescence
imaging of cells double-labeled with MitoTracker Green
(Molecular Probes) and cytochrome C antibody. After
treatment, cells were incubated with 100 nM MitoTracker
Green, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized
with 0.02% Triton X and blocked with 5% BSA, followed
by treatment with primary rabbit polyclonal cytochrome
C antibody for 2 h at room temperature and Cy2conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h. Cellular
images were acquired by using a fluorescence microscope
(40X amplification, Nikon, Japan).
