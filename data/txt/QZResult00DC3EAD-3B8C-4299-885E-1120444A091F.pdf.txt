Abstract

Author Manuscript

Type II topoisomerases are required for the management of DNA tangles and supercoils1, and are
targets of clinical antibiotics and anti-cancer agents2. These enzymes catalyze the ATP-dependent
passage of one DNA duplex (the transport or T-segment) through a transient, double-stranded
break in another (the gate or G-segment), navigating DNA through the protein using a set of
dissociable internal interfaces, or “gates”3,4. For more than 20 years, it has been established that a
pair of dimer-related tyrosines, together with divalent cations, catalyze G-segment cleavage5–7.
Recent efforts have proposed that strand scission relies on a “two-metal mechanism”8–10, a
ubiquitous biochemical strategy that supports vital cellular processes ranging from DNA synthesis
to RNA self-splicing11,12. Here we present the structure of the DNA-binding and cleavage core
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae topo II covalently linked to DNA through its active-site tyrosine at
2.5 Å resolution, revealing for the first time the organization of a cleavage-competent type II
topoisomerase configuration. Unexpectedly, metal-soaking experiments indicate that cleavage is
catalyzed by a novel variation of the classic two-metal approach. Comparative analyses extend
this scheme to explain how distantly-related type IA topoisomerases cleave single-stranded DNA,
unifying the cleavage mechanisms for these two essential enzyme families. The structure also
highlights a hitherto undiscovered allosteric relay that actuates a molecular “trapdoor” to prevent

chromosome-disentangling machine auto-regulates DNA-breakage to prevent the aberrant
formation of mutagenic and cytotoxic genomic lesions.

A wealth of structural and biochemical efforts have illuminated key aspects of type II
topoisomerase mechanism; however, a biophysical understanding of their control of DNA
cleavage chemistry has remained persistently out of reach. A prior DNA-bound, type II
topoisomerase structure showed how these enzymes engage and bend substrate duplexes13,
but captured a pre-cleavage intermediate that could not comment on strand scission. Because
type II topoisomerases disfavour cleavage when bound to short oligonucleotides, we used
bridging phosphorothiolate chemistry to create a suicide substrate that leaves a free thiol
unable to support religation14. This approach has been used at the 5′-ribose position to trap
and image a 3′-end cleaving type I topoisomerase (topo IB) linked to DNA15. To form an
irreversible cleavage complex with a 5′-end cleaving type II topoisomerase, we incubated
the principal DNA binding and cleavage domain of S. cerevisiae topo II (residues 408–
1177) with a DNA substrate containing a nick at one cleavage site and a 3′-bridging
phosphorothiolate at the other (Figs. 1a–b). Following co-crystallization, we determined the
structure of this complex to 2.5 Å resolution using molecular replacement. Electron density
permitted building and refinement of a model to an Rwork/Rfree of 23.9%/25.9% (Figs. 1c,
S1; Table S1), and showed clear evidence for a covalent 5′ link between DNA and the
active-site tyrosine (Y782) resident in topo II’s Winged Helix Domain (WHD) (Figs. 1a,
1d).

The structure reveals the constellation of amino acids required to form a cleavage-competent
active site. However, given the known metal dependence for DNA cleavage by type II
topoisomerases6, we were at first puzzled by a lack of electron density for these cofactors,
despite the presence of 2.5 mM MgCl2 in the crystallization milieu. Suspecting this absence
might be due to the low pH (4.5) of crystallization, we solved a second structure of an
isomorphous crystal soaked at a higher pH (6.5) with zinc chloride (Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+
did not produce suitable diffraction, and glutaraldehyde cross-linking was required to
stabilize the crystals for pH exchange). Soaking strategies have been used successfully to
gain insights into other divalent cation-dependent polymerase and phosphodiesterase
systems such as DNA Pol I and RNaseH16,17. Anomalous difference maps for this
structure, which was determined by molecular replacement to 3.0 Å resolution, show clear
evidence for two zinc ions (7 σ peaks) in the active site. As anticipated from prior studies of
topo II and its related bacterial counterpart, DNA gyrase, the ions are coordinated by highlyconserved acidic residues within the enzyme’s Topoisomerase/Primase (TOPRIM)
domain18, with E449 and D526 contacting metal A, and D526 and D528 engaging metal B
(Figs. 1a, 2).
In classic two-metal polymerase/phosphodiesterase reactions, one ion activates a catalytic
water or ribose hydroxyl for nucleophilic attack, while the other coordinates a leaving
group12. Both cofactors stabilize a pentavalent transition state. Because of the frequent
occurrence of this mechanism across many unrelated biomolecular systems, we were
surprised to observe that the metal organization in topo II does not recapitulate such a

configuration (Fig. S2). Metal A interacts with both a non-bridging oxygen of the
phosphotyrosine and the 3′-ribose position (Fig. 2), and is thus well-positioned to assist with
transition state chemistry. However, metal B sits farther afield, contacting only a nonbridging oxygen of the (−1/−2) phosphate upstream of the cleavage site.

Author Manuscript

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that some positional shift could take place to
reorient the active site and metal ions into a more canonical two-metal arrangement, several
lines of evidence indicate that the structure observed here recapitulates a catalyticallyrelevant configuration. Replacement of an invariant arginine (R781), which contacts the
phosphotyrosine moiety, dramatically reduces DNA cleavage and relaxation activity19,
except when substituted with lysine20. Metal binding at either the A or B locus has been
seen previously in two different type II topoisomerase structures (Fig. 2)13,21, and mutation
of associated liganding groups severely compromises strand scission in both eukaryotic and
bacterial enzymes8–10. The relative position of the metal-binding cluster with respect to
DNA and the active-site tyrosine is further supported by: 1) patterns of thiol-dependent
DNA cleavage seen in cysteine-mutagenesis and metal-ion rescue experiments consistent
with the bonding arrangement seen here9,10, 2) the formation of an ion pair between two
highly-conserved amino acids (D530 and R690) required for wild-type function19, and 3) a
new role for an invariant histidine (H736), which engages the (−1) phosphate bound by
metal B. Finally, in the metal-free structure, the thio-ribose 3′-SH adopts a C2′ endo (B-form
DNA) sugar pucker non-optimally oriented for promoting religation, whereas in the zincbound structure, the thiol flips to a C3′ endo state (A form) similar to its neighboring
nucleotides, moving within 2.0 Å of metal A and taking an in-line position with respect to
the phosphotyrosyl linkage.

Author Manuscript

Collectively, these interactions indicate that type II topoisomerases employ a distinct
variation of canonical two-metal mechanisms (Fig. 3a). In this scheme, one ion (metal A)
partakes directly in transition state stabilization and in promoting the leaving and attacking
of the ribose 3′-OH during DNA cleavage and religation. The other (metal B) plays a role in
anchoring the DNA. The reason why type II topoisomerases may have lost the need for a
second metal in performing chemistry likely is due to: 1) the lower pKa (~10–11) of the
attacking tyrosine nucleophile during cleavage, which makes it easier to deprotonate
compared to water or an incoming ribose hydroxyl (pKa ~13–15), and 2) the acquisition of a
positively-charged arginine, which takes the place of the second metal to assist with
transition state stabilization and to depress the pKa on the tyrosine. Consistent with this
reasoning, basic side-chain groups are not typically found to directly coordinate the reactive
phosphate in classic two-metal ion systems.

Our structure further reconciles the type II topoisomerase cleavage mechanism with that
used by type IA topoisomerases, enzymes that cleave single, rather than double, DNA
strands. Prior studies have noted that both groups of topoisomerases employ the same
collection of active site residues and conserved domains to cut DNA22. Moreover, both type
II and IA topoisomerases form 5′-phosphotyrosyl bonds and require metal ions for full
activity7,23. However, one perplexing difference between the two families is that DNA
cleavage by type IA topoisomerases is not strictly metal-dependent: although religation
requires metal ions, their presence is needed only to stimulate, but not execute, strand

scission7. Comparison of the type II and IA24 topoisomerase active sites reveals the
existence of an extra lysine in type IA topoisomerases that contacts the scissile phosphate
(Fig. 3b). This lysine is found in all IA enzymes, although it switches between two adjacent
locations in topo I and topo III paralogs (Fig. S3). Significantly, mutation of this lysine in
topo I abrogates metal-independent cleavage25, suggesting that this basic amino acid is able
to promote strand scission by fulfilling the role of metal A. Moreover, because this amino
acid is incapable of polarizing the resultant 3′-OH, it would not be expected to support
religation. Consistent with this reasoning, substitution of the amino acid equivalent to D526
in our structure with asparagine in topo I (D117N) creates a dominant lethal enzyme that
does not efficiently religate DNA, even in the presence of metals26, likely because a key
metal-A binding residue is disrupted and hence favours lysine-mediated cleavage. Similarly,
type II topoisomerases, which lack this lysine, cannot cleave DNA without metal ions
present. Thus, the structure unifies previously conflicting lines of evidence to establish a
common cleavage mechanism between two distantly-related and functionally distinct
topoisomerase families.

Author Manuscript

Finally, our structure establishes a new molecular connection by which DNA breakage is
coordinated with the association and dissociation of inter-subunit interfaces during strand
scission to prevent the accidental formation of double-strand DNA breaks. One major
difference between a previous, noncovalent DNA-topo II structure and the present study is
that the primary dimer interface of the enzyme (the “C-gate”) switches from an open to a
closed state (Fig. 4a). Comparison of the structures reveals why: formation of a covalent
attachment between Y782 and DNA pulls the tyrosine upward from its uncleaved position
by ~6 Å (Fig. 4b). This movement is made possible by a rocking of the WHD domains (Fig.
S4a), which in turn tugs on a long linker and small α-helix (residues 797–802) that engages
a set of distal coiled-coil “lever arms” through a conserved salt-bridge network (D799,
R1001, and R1008) (Figs. S4b–c). Motions at this elbow joint have been shown previously
to open and close the DNA-binding regions of topo II (Fig. S4d)27– 29. Here, however,
formation of the phosphotyrosyl bond acts like the drawstring on a latch to pull the coiled
coils inward, driving C-gate closure. This transition highlights how the status of the active
site is communicated to DNA gating element over 50 Å away, and reveals that type IIA
topoisomerases retain a molecular “trapdoor” as a failsafe to ensure that protein/protein
interactions are maximized at times when DNA is cleaved (Fig. S5). Such tight control over
DNA cleavage and inter-subunit associations helps explain how the fidelity of the type II
topoisomerase breakage/rejoining reaction is maximized to protect the genome from the
aberrant formation of potentially damaging and cytotoxic DNA lesions during supercoiling
management and chromosome disentanglement.

Methods Summary
The covalent cleavage complex was trapped as described previously30 and purified by
tandem cation-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. Crystals were grown by
hanging-drop vapour diffusion, and diffraction data collected on BL8.3.1 (Advanced Light
Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). Initial phases were calculated by
molecular replacement. For soaks, crystals were glutaraldehyde cross-linked in situ and
exchanged into higher pH by vapour diffusion, prior to the addition of ZnCl2.
