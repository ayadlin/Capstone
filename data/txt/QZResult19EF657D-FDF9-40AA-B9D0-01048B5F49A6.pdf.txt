Abstract
Here we studied the relevance and modulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) expression in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) chemoresistant cell
subpopulations (ALDHbright cells), which survive pemetrexed + cisplatin treatment
in vitro and in vivo. Expression of the ALDH1A3 isoform was invariably enriched in
purified ALDHbright cells from multiple MPM cell lines and accounted for the enzymatic
activity of those cells. RNAi mediated downregulation of ALDH1A3 reduced the survival
of the ALDHbright cells at steady state and, much more, after pemetrexed + cisplatin
treatment. We demonstrated, for the first time, that a pSTAT3(tyr705)-NFkB(p65)
complex is required for the repression of DDIT3 mRNA and this ensures high levels
of CEBPβ-dependent ALDH1A3 promoter activity. Inhibition of STAT3-NFkB activity
allowed high levels of DDIT3 expression with increased formation of a DDIT3-CEBPβ
complex. This reduced the occupancy of the ALDH1A3 promoter by CEBPβ, thus
largely reducing the ALDH1A3 expression. Consequently, survival of ALDHbright cells in
pemetrexed + cisplatin-treated cultures was impaired, following increased apoptosis.
We show that such a mechanism is relevant in vivo and underlies the action of butein,
a dual STAT3-NFkB inhibitor capable of abating the chemoresistance of mesothelioma
cells in vivo. The possible broad translational relevance of the described mechanism
is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

chemoresistance, mesenchymal traits and high levels of
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity (ALDHbright
cells) [4] and those properties were shared by lung cancer
ALDHbright cells resistant to gefinitib and cisplatin [5].
The ALDHbright cells represented, quantitatively, the
main chemoresistant cell subpopulation in several other
tumors and could be tracked by FACS-based assays [4,
6-8]. ALDHs are a family of enzymes with heterogeneous
intracellular localization and substrate specificity, which
function by oxidizing intracellular aldehydes to carboxylic
acid, in physiological and patho-physiological conditions
[9, 10]. Additionally, ALDHs have been involved in

Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is a
neoplastic disease whose challenging clinical management
is characterized by silent progression, extremely low
response rate to chemotherapy (pemetrexed + cisplatin)
and poor prognosis [1-3]. There is an unmet need for
better therapeutic options for such a fatal disease. We have
recently shown that pemetrexed and cisplatin treatment
of MPM cell lines and primary cultures triggered the
emergence of cell subpopulations exhibiting absolute

conferring resistance to some alkylating agents [11,
12]. Enriched expression of ALDH isoforms has been
observed in a conspicuous number of developmentally
unrelated tumors [13-17]. For example, expression of the
ALDH1A3 has been experimentally shown to modulate
survival of melanoma and glioma cell subpopulations
exhibiting properties of cancer stem cells [18, 19] and to
promote pro-tumorigenic features in breast cancer cells
[20]. Therefore, ALDHs can be therapeutically relevant
targets in cancer [6].
Members of the CAAT/Enhancer-Binding Protein
(CEBP) family were shown to modulate expression of
the ALDH enzymes in different experimental settings,
through binding to conserved CAAT binding site in
proximity of the transcription start site [21-24]. On the
other hand, the DDIT3/CHOP/GADD153 gene, whose
levels are modulated by a plethora of stress stimuli [25],
including chemotherapy [26, 27], was shown to modulate
the CEBPβ transcriptional activity via protein-protein
interactions in fibroblasts [25] and retinoic acid (RA)
treated cells [22]. Notably, DDIT3 was shown to be
modulated by STAT3 [28, 29].
The STAT3 pathway may modulate the number
of NSCLC- and mesothelioma- ALDHbright cells [4, 30]
and, notably, glioma cells of the mesenchymal subtype,
which require STAT3 (and CEBPβ) for their survival
[31], exhibited high levels of ALDH1A3 expression
[19]. NFκB is constitutively active in most cancers
[32] and exhibits extensive networking with several
cancer signaling pathways, including STAT3 [33, 34].
We have shown that STAT3 and NFkB physically and
functionally interacted in chemotherapy resistant MPM
cell lines [35]. Treatment of MPM cell lines with butein
(a multifunctional tetrahydroxychalcone), interfered
with the stability of the STAT3-NFkB and this correlated
with decreased chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo
[35]. However, the molecular mechanism whereby
interference with the STAT3-NFkB complex could affect
MPM chemoresistance were not defined. Additionally,
it was unclear whether this involved rearrangement of
chemoresistant MPM cell subpopulations. Last but not
least, it was not known which ALDH isoform(s) were
expressed in the chemoresistant ALDHbright MPM cells and
the functional relevance of ALDH expression for those
cell subpopulations.
By combining in vitro and in vivo approaches,
we demonstrate here that a STAT3-NFkB-dependent
repression of DDIT3 expression ensures high levels
of CEBPβ-dependent ALDH1A3 expression and that
modulates the survival and resistance of the ALDHbright
cells to pemetrexed + cisplatin treatment in vitro and
in vivo. Thus, we show that repression of DDIT3 levels
may represent a cell subpopulation-specific mechanism
of resistance to therapy which can be targeted in vivo
by butein. Given the broad alteration of the STAT3 and
NFkB signaling pathways in cancer [32, 36] and the

presence of ALDHbright cells in many neoplastic diseases,
the conclusion of this study may be of broader relevance.

RESULTS
Butein affects the survival of ALDHbright cells after
pemetrexed + cisplatin treatment
Given that the ALDHbright MPM cells are the
main subcellular population resistant to pemetrexed
[4] and given the ability of butein to counteract the
chemoresistance of MPM cells in vitro and in vivo [35],
we tested the hypothesis that the latter compound may
affect the survival of the ALDHbright cell subpopulations.
Treatment with butein (B: 18 µM), alone or in
combination with pemetrexed + cisplatin (P+C: 10 µM
+ 5 µM, respectively) for 96hrs strongly reduced the
number of ALDHbright cells in multiple unrelated MPM
cell lines (n=10) and prevented their increase after
pemetrexed+cisplatin (P+C) treatment (Fig. 1A-1B, p <
0.05). Since disappearance of ALDHbright cells may follow
direct enzyme inhibition or downregulation of ALDH
expression, we explored which of the two processes
underlied the effects of butein. Short term (0-12hrs)
treatment of MPM cells with butein did not affect the
ALDH activity (suppl. Fig. 1A, upper and lower). To
assess whether butein may modulate the expression rather
than the activity of ALDHs, we first determined which
ALDH isoform(s) would be enriched in the ALDHbright
cells (Fig. 1C). We assessed (by quantitative PCR) the
mRNA levels of the (detectable) ALDH isoforms in FACS
sorted ALDHbright and ALDHlow cells from unrelated MPM
cell lines (average purity of the ALDHbright cells: 92-96%,
n=6). Quantitative PCR revealed that the ALDH1A3 (and,
to a much lesser extent, ALDH1A1 and ALDH2) was
enriched in the ALDHbright cells of all the analyzed cell
lines (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C, heat map).

The ALDH1A3 isoform is responsible for the
ALDH activity of the MPM cells
Next, we infected MSTO-211H and HP-1 cells with
shRNAs against ALDH2, ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3,
respectively (Fig. 1D, left). We found that only knocking
down of ALDH1A3 correlated with a reduction of the
ALDHbright cell number (Fig. 1D, right). Together this data
(Figs. 1C and 1D) suggests that the ALDH1A3 isoform is
primarily responsible for ALDH activity of MPM cells.

Butein downregulates the expression of ALDH1A3
thereby affecting the viability of the MPM
ALDHbright cells

of multiple apoptotic effectors: TRAILR1 (DR4) and
TRAILR2 (DR5); BAX and BAD and the mitochondriareleased HTRA2 (Fig. 1G). Notably, some DNA damage
and stress response genes were also upregulated with a
similar trend (Fig. 1G).

Quantitative PCR analysis of RNA extracted
from FACS sorted ALDHbright cells revealed that
butein treatment triggered a strong, time dependent,
downregulation of the of ALDH1A3 mRNA levels (Fig.
1E, upper panel), in agreement with our hypothesis that
butein affects the expression rather than the activity of
the ALDH enzyme(s). This paralleled a sharp decrease,
in the same cells, of the protein levels (lower panel, Fig.
1E). To detail the fate of ALDHbright cells treated with
butein and its relationship with the levels of ALDH1A3,
we evaluated the viability of MSTO-211H and HP-1
cells treated with vehicle (V), butein (B), in absence
or presence of pemetrexed + cisplatin treatment (P+C
vs B+P+C, respectively) and upon RNAi-mediated
downregulation of ALDH1A3 (Fig. 1F). SYTOX red
staining revealed that the (P+C) treatment marginally
affected the viability of the control vector-infected cells
(as compared to the vehicle-treated cells), in line with
the increased resistance of the ALDHbright cells to these
treatments [4]. Co-treatment with butein (B+P+C) strongly
increased the effect of the P+C treatment on the same
cells (Fig. 1F). In the same conditions, downregulation
of ALDH1A3 strongly mimicked the effect of butein and
did not significantly increase the effect of butein treatment
(Fig. 1F), suggesting that modulation of ALDH1A3 levels
is the main mechanism mediating the effect of butein
on the viability of the ALDHbright cells. Probing of an
apoptosis antibody array with whole cell lysates from
HP-1 ALDHbright cells treated with B, P+C or with B+P+C
confirmed increased levels, in the B+P+C treated cells
(as compared to B and P+C treated samples-p < 0.05),

Butein downregulates the activity of the
ALDH1A3 promoter
To investigate the modulation of ALDH1A3 mRNA
by butein (Fig. 1E), we transfected MSTO-211H and HP-1
MPM cells with a luciferase reporter vector containing the
ALDH1A3 promoter (from -900 to +170bp). Treatment of
the cells with vehicle or butein 24hrs later revealed that
the latter strongly downregulated the luciferase expression
in a time dependent way (Fig. 2A).This experiment
suggested that butein may directly affect the ALDH1A3
mRNA levels by modulating its promoter activity.

Butein treatment reduces the binding of CEBPβ
to the endogenous ALDH1A3 promoter
A CAAT box (a consensus for the binding of the
CEBPβ transcription factor), was shown to be crucial for
the promoter activity of several ALDH family members
[21, 22] and in house bioinformatics analysis (MATCHTM,
BIOBASE) revealed that the ALDH1A3 promoter
contained a conserved CAAT box (-50/-36bp from the
transcription start site). Quantitative PCR analysis of
chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) with anti-CEBPβ
antibodies from MSTO-211H and HP-1 cells revealed
effective occupancy of the CEBPβ- binding site in vehicletreated cells (as compared to a isotype-matched rabbit
IgG). Butein treatment strongly reduced the occupancy
of the CEBPβ binding site by CEBPβ (Fig. 2B). This

strongly correlated with the effect of the drug on the
ALDH1A3mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1E). CEBPβ
transcriptional activity is modulated through proteinprotein interactions involving several transcription factors,
including the stress response DDIT3/CHOP/GADD153,
formerly identified as both a modulator of CEBPβ activity
and a stress responsive factor (including chemotherapy)
[25].

First, we evaluated the status of the STAT3 pathway in
purified ALDHbright cells. Western blotting of whole cell
lysates from both ALDHbright and ALDHlow cells of three
representative cell lines revealed strong enrichment for
the pSTAT3(tyr705) signal (with slight changes in the
levels of the total STAT3 protein) in the ALDHbright cell
fraction (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, quantitative PCR of 30
representative, literature selected STAT3 target genes [38]
revealed that most of the targets exhibited higher levels in
the ALDHbright cells as opposed to the ALDHlow cells (suppl.
Fig. 3). Butein treatment modulated the levels of most of
the targets in both ALDHbright and ALDHlow cells (Suppl.
Fig. 3), and, to a much higher extent, the levels of a subset
of those genes in the ALDHbright cells, including DDIT3 (as
compared to the ALDHlow cells)(Fig. 3B). Thus, the MPM
ALDHbright cells exhibited higher activation of the STAT3
pathway and responsivity to butein treatment.
We next investigated in detail the modulation
of DDIT3 by butein. Since upregulation of DDIT3 by
butein may result from increased promoter activity,
we transfected HP-1 and MSTO-211H cells with a
mCHERRY reporter driven by the minimal promoter of
DDIT3 (-649/+136)[39](Fig. 3C). Butein treatment (18
µM) strongly induced the promoter activity over time
(as compared to vehicle treatment), as evidenced by the
increase in the mCHERRY positive cells detected by
fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3C, p < 0.05). We next
performed DNA affinity precipitation assays (DAPA) by
using a biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the STAT3
binding site in the DDIT3 promoter. Western Blotting of
the eluted material revealed that the binding of STAT3
to the promoter fragment in vitro was strongly reduced
by butein treatment (18 µM for 8hrs), as compared to
vehicle treatment (Fig. 3D). Staining with a phosphoSTAT3 antibody (Tyr705) showed a strong reduction of
the STAT3 phosphorylation in the butein-treated samples
(Fig. 3D). Additionally, western blotting of the DAPA
eluate with anti-NFkB(p65) antibodies revealed binding
of NFkBp65 to the STAT3 oligonucleotide, which was
strongly reduced upon butein-treatment (Fig. 3D).
Altogheter, this correlated with the modulation of DDIT3
levels in the butein treated cells (Suppl. Fig. 2 and Fig. 2C2D).To support these in vitro observations, we performed
CHIP experiments. First, we immunoprecipitated the
chromatin from vehicle and butein treated MSTO-211H
cells (18 µM for 20hrs) with antibodies specific for
STAT3, phosphoSTAT3 (tyr705) and NFkB (p65) (Fig.
3E). Notably, the phospho-STAT3 antibody does not
recognize un-phosphorylated STAT3. Quantitative PCR
of the eluted chromatin with primers amplifying a region
encompassing the STAT3 binding sequence used for the
in vitro binding studies, revealed specific enrichment of
the DDIT3 promoter fragment in the STAT3, pSTAT3
and NFkB immunoprecipitated chromatin (as compared
to control IgG immunoprecipitation) and no amplification
of a “off target” region was observed (Fig. 3E). Butein

Butein affects DDIT3 mRNA and protein levels by
modulating the DDIT3 promoter
Thus, we investigated whether butein treatment may
alter the levels of DDIT3 and whether this may interfere
with CEBPβ activity. Butein treatment increased the levels
of DDIT3 mRNA over time in two representative MPM
cell lines (Suppl. Fig. 2) and this matched increased levels
of the protein, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence
and by western blotting (Fig. 2C-D). Additionally,
increased levels of DDIT3 matched decreased amount of
ALDH1A3 in the treated cells (Fig. 2D).

Increased binding of DDIT3 to CEBPβ in buteintreated cells
Given the ability of DDIT3 to negatively modulate
CEBPβ transcriptional activity via protein-protein
interactions [22, 25], we immunoprecipitated DDIT3
from unfractionated extracts of vehicle- and buteintreated MSTO-211H (and HP-1) cells (Fig. 2E). Western
blotting of the immunoprecipitated material readily
detected increased amounts of CEBPβ bound to DDIT3
upon butein treatment, suggesting that the increased
DDIT3 in the butein treated cells interacted more or more
strongly with CEBPβ (Fig. 2E). This strictly correlated
with the observed decreased amount of CEBPβ bound to
the ALDH1A3 promoter (Fig 2B) and, ultimately, with
the reduced levels of ALDH1A3 mRNA, in the butein
treated samples (Fig. 1E). RNAi-mediated downregulation
of CEBPβ (Fig. 2F, left) strongly decreased both the
ALDH1A3 endogenous mRNA (Fig. 2F, right) and the
luciferase activity driven by the ALDH1A3 promoter (Fig.
2G), thereby strictly mimicking the effect of butein and
providing further support to the previous observations.

STAT3 inhibition underlies the effect of butein on
the DDIT3 levels
DDIT3 is a target gene of STAT3 and its levels
are upregulated in cells where binding of STAT3 to its
promoter is diminished [28], implying active repression.
Since we and others have shown that butein inhibits
STAT3 [35, 37], we tested whether butein increased
the levels of DDIT3 by inhibiting STAT3 activation.

Butein unlocks the constitutive, STAT3-dependent
repression of DDIT3 mRNA in the ALDHbright cells
thereby affecting their tolerance to chemotherapyinduced stress

treatment significantly decreased the occupancy of the
STAT3 binding site by all three factors (P < 0.05)(Fig. 3E).
This suggest that a complex containing STAT3, pSTAT3
and NFkB binds to the STAT3 binding site of the DDIT3
promoter region in vivo.
In order to verify the existence of such a complex,
we performed sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation
experiments (re-CHIP) (Fig. 3F). After a first
round of CHIP with anti STAT3 antibodies, we reimmunoprecipitated the eluted material with rabbit IgGs,
STAT3, pSTAT3 and NFkB antibodies, respectively.
Quantitative PCR revealed enrichment of the DDIT3
promoter fragment in the secondary immunoprecipitations
(Fig.3F) demonstrating a physical association of STAT3
and NFkB. Additionally, the data suggested that the
complex contained STAT3 in both its un-phosphorylated
and phosphorylated (Tyr705) form (Fig. 3F). In order
to assess the relevance of the single factors within the
complex, we knocked-down STAT3 and NFkB (p65) in
MSTO-211H and HP-1 cells by using RNAi. Western
blotting with anti-STAT3 and anti-NFkB antibodies
revealed effective downregulation of STAT3 and NFkB
protein in the transfected cells (as compared to their
control-scrambled RNA (Fig. 3G left panel). Quantitative
PCR revealed higher levels of DDIT3 mRNA and reduced
levels of ALDH1A3 mRNA in the cells with reduced
expression of both STAT3 and NFkB (fig.3G, right panel),
matching the observed binding of both factors the DDIT3
promoter in vivo (Fig. 3E-3F). Altogether, these data
supported the reported ability of butein to interfere with
the STAT3-NFkB interaction [35] and the reported indirect
modulation of the DDIT3 levels by NFkB[40].

Next, we focused on modulation of the DDIT3
mRNA levels in chemotherapy treated cells, with
and without butein treatment. We found that purified
ALDHbright cells from all the MPM cell lines tested
(n=6) exhibited lower levels of DDIT3 mRNA than their
ALDHlow counterparts (Fig. 4A, heat map). Pemetrexed +
cisplatin (P+C) treatment failed to upregulate the DDIT3
mRNA in the ALDHbright cells (while readily doing so in
the ALDHlow cells), in line with the relative resistance of
the ALDHbright cells to P+C treatment (Fig. 4A, heat map).
Importantly, butein treatment increased DDIT3 mRNA
in both ALDHbright and ALDHlow cells, raising the DDIT3
mRNA levels even in the P+C treated ALDHbright cells (Fig.
4A, heat map). The described trend in the mRNA levels
was similarly observed when the DDIT3 protein levels
were assessed in western blottings from representative
ALDHbright and ALDHlow MSTO-211H cells (Fig. 4B).
In line with the previous observations, analysis of the
clonogenicity of the ALDHbright and ALDHlow cells treated
as from Fig. 4A revealed that butein treatment potentiated
the P+C treatment in both cell subpopulations (Fig. 4C),
suggesting that butein-mediated unlocking of the DDIT3
levels in the ALDHbright cells was biologically relevant.
Altogether, this correlated with the increased apoptotic
response of the ALDHbright cells when treated with B+P+C
(Fig. 1G). Thus, butein treatment could reverse, in vitro,
the resistance of ALDHbright cells by counteracting the
hyperactivation of the STAT3 pathway in the latter cell

day 24) revealed a significant effect of butein, both when
administered alone and, more strongly, when combined
to P+C (as compared to those excised from the vehicletreated mice) (p<0.05) (Fig. 5A). Additionally, only 4/6
tumors were detectable in the B+P+C treated mice at
the time of excision (Fig. 5A, left and right panel). No
statistically significant reduction in weight of the P+C
treated tumors as compared to the vehicle-treated tumors
was observed (Fig. 5A, left panel). Butein treatment
synergized with pemetrexed + cisplatin in reducing
tumor weight, thus mirroring the chemosensitizing
effects observed in vitro (Fig. 4C). We postulated that, as
observed in vitro, the chemosensitizing effect observed in
vivo should correlate with a change in the number of the

ALDHbright cells within the butein treated tumor masses.
FACS analysis of tumors disaggregated within one hour
from harvesting revealed that the percentage of ALDHbright
cells was significantly reduced in the butein treated
tumors (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5B). Within the same experimental
setting, we observed no statistically significant change in
the number of ALDHbright cells within the pemetrexed +
cisplatin treated tumors, while butein cotreatment caused
the ALDHbright cell number to drop significantly and
dramatically upon P+C treatment (as compared to the P+C
treated mice, p < 0.05, Fig. 5B).

in all the butein-treated tumors (Fig. 5C-D, respectively).
P+C treatment elicited an increase of DDIT3 mRNA as
well (Fig. 5D), which however did not correlate with the
ALDHbright cell number (Fig. 5B) and with the ALDH1A3
mRNA levels (Fig. 5C). This apparent lack of correlation
in the P+C treated tumors was possibly due to the unsorted
nature of the samples analyzed, thus reflecting the effect of
the DNA damaging agents on the chemosensitive ALDHlow
cell subpopulations, the predominant cell subpopulation
in the excised tumors (Fig. 5B). To verify this possibility,
we performed 3D clonogenic assays (a surrogate of
tumor relapse) on the same cells and this revealed that
the B+P+C treated tumors exhibited a large loss of sphere
forming potential as compared to those derived from
the P+C treated mice which were mostly unaffected (as
compared to the vehicle treated tumor masses, p < 0.05)
(Fig. 5E) suggesting a reduced pool of chemoresistant
cells in the butein-treated tumors due to targeting of
the ALDHbright chemoresistant cell subpopulations. In

summary, butein can increase the DDIT3 mRNA levels
in the ALDHbright cells and this may rescue the sensitivity
of such a cell subpopulation to the chemotherapy-induced
stress both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 6).

versus best prognosis gliomas [31] and low DDIT3 levels
may be prognostically relevant for MPM [50]. Notably,
low DDIT3 levels are a requirement for RAS-mediated
cell transformation [51].
It is very likely that the function of the STAT3/
NFkB axis here described does not influence only the
ALDH1A3 promoter and may involve modulation of
additional CEBPβ-dependent promoters. Additionally,
cells endowed with high cytoplasmic levels of DDIT3
exhibited modulation of complex and novel transcriptional
targets encompassing both activation and repression
functions, when challenged with stress stimuli [52]. Thus,
the survival of the ALDHbright cells may rely on additional
pathways perturbed by the reciprocal modulation of
DDIT3/CEBPβ activity, not addressed here. While this
can be a limitation of the present work, it does not detract
from the central role played by ALDH1A3 in contributing
resistance of the ALDHbright cells to stress. In line with this,
the fact that knocking down of ALDH1A3 did not increase
the effect of butein strongly suggests that modulation of
ALDH1A3 activity is a main target mechanism of this
compound.
Here we do not address how the ALDH1A3
expression contributes stress tolerance to the ALDHbright
cells. The contribution of ALDH1A3 to survival is
probably complex and results from multiple mechanisms.
For example, enriched expression for ALDH1A3 was
shown to confer specific metabolic features to glioma
“stem-like” cells [19]. In line with our observations

DISCUSSION
In this work, by exploiting Malignant Pleural
Mesothelioma as an experimental model of tumor
chemoresistance [4, 41], we demonstrated that a specific
ALDH isoform, namely ALDH1A3, is enriched in
chemoresistant mesothelioma cell subpopulations purified
from multiple sources. This observation echoes what
others have observed in breast, melanoma, non-small –
cell lung-cancers and mesenchymal-type glioma [14, 18,
19, 30, 42]. Here we can add that expression of ALDH1A3
impinges on the tolerance to stress-induced chemotherapy
in vitro and in vivo. In line with this function, we show that
this process is modulated by factors known to play a role
in cancer chemoresistance [34, 43-47]. In facts, among the
factors shown here to modulate ALDH1A3 expression, C/
EBPβ and STAT3 have already emerged as prognostically
relevant modulators of the glioma mesenchymal phenotype
[31, 48] and NFkB was shown to be constitutively active
in a number of tumors [32],including MPM, where its
constitutive activity may results from the asbestos-induced
chronical inflammation [49]. Additionally, DDIT3 was
identified in a TCGA worst-prognosis signature (TWPS)
comprising 884 genes differentially expressed in worst

Figure 6: Proposed working model. The ALDHbright cells exhibit constitutive activation of the STAT3 pathway which triggers

downregulation of DDIT3 mRNA levels both at steady state and upon pemetrexed+cisplatin treatment. Interference with STAT3NFkB function unlocks expression of DDIT3 in the ALDHbright cells and this reduces the occupancy of ALDH1A3 promoter by CEBPβ
thereby lowering ALDH1A3 expression and the intracellular ALDH activity and strongly affecting the survival of the ALDHbright cells to
chemotherapy-induced stress.

showing that ALDH1A3 is STAT3 target, it is intriguing
to observe how the metabolic phenotype of the ALDH1A3
expressing glioma cells, consisting of aerobic glycolysis,
is similar to that of cells expressing a transforming version
of the STAT3 protein with increased nuclear retention
and transcriptional activity [19, 53]. ALDH1A3 is also
very important for the production of retinoic acid (RA)
[54, 55]. We may speculate that the ALDHbright cells
(enriched for ALDH1A3 expression/activity) may indeed
produce retinoic acid (RA) metabolites, the latter acting as
paracrine signaling molecules. RA may signal to adjacent
cells and confer protumorigenic properties. Relevant to
this, Marcato and Lee’s groups have demonstrated that
ALDH1A3-mediated modulation of RA-target genes
contributes in vivo protumorigenic properties including
the transcription of the MUC4 oncogene [20], to MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells. Last but not least, our
observations suggest that butein-mediated downregulation
of ALDH1A3 is pro-apoptotic and this effect is much
increased in presence of pemetrexed + cisplatin mediated
DNA damage. Interestingly, involvement in the DNA
damage response was recently identified as a function
of ALDH1A1 in breast, prostate and ovary cancer cells
[12, 56, 57]. The downregulation of ALDH1A3 may thus
amplify a DNA damage response, consistent with the
chemosensitizing effects observed in vivo.
On a wider perspective, low DDIT3 levels in the
ALDHbright cells may promote unperturbed CEBPβ activity
during stress. CEBPβ is a modulator of the mesenchymal
phenotype and interference with CEBPβ function (in
absence of adipogenic or chondrocyte commitment
stimuli), is known to negatively affect the undifferentiated
state of mesenchymal precursors[58]. Relevant to this, we
have shown that the ALDHbright cells exhibit mesenchymal
properties such as expression of mesenchymal markers
and hypermigratory features [4] and ALDH activators
were shown to increase expression of mesenchymal
markers and multipotency of salivary gland precursors
[59]. Thus, we may speculate that keeping DDIT3 levels
low in stress conditions would allow the ALDHbright cells
to survive, to transmit protumorigenic stimuli to adjacent
cells and to maintain a specific, possibly differentiation
related, metabolic cell identity.
For the in vivo studies, we have exploited butein,
already known to us for counteracting chemoresistance of
MPM cells in vivo and in vitro [35]. To note, we show here
that the 3D clonogenicity of the cells derived from buteintreated excised tumors is strongly reduced. This suggests
the possibility that butein may exhaust the chemoresistant
cell pool within treated tumors and thus may prevent or
strongly delay tumor relapse. This has some translational
relevance especially if we consider that butein was shown
to not affect normal, untransformed cell lines and to not
shorten survival of non-tumor bearing mice [35]. Last, our
observations might likely be of interest for other neoplastic
diseases characterized by STAT3-NFkB activation and

chemoresistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
The human MPM cell lines MSTO-211H, H-28,
H-2052 were from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). H-2591,
H-2818, H-2595, H-2373, H-2461, HP-1, H-2596 were
obtained as described elsewhere [60]. All the cell lines
were Mycoplasma free and used at passages 2-6 from
thawing. Cells were cultured as monolayers at 37 °C and
5% CO2 in DMEM/F12+GLUTAMAX supplemented
with 10% non-heat inactivated FBS (fetal bovine serum)
(Life Technologies, Gran Island, NY USA). For drug
treatments, cells were exposed for the indicated length of
time to butein, cisplatin and pemetrexed. Afterthat growth
medium was changed with a drug free medium and cells
allowed to growth for the additional time indicated in each
legend.

Reagents
Pemetrexed, cisplatin and butein (Selleckchem,
Texas, USA) were dissolved according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Retroviral transduction, promoter reporter and
luciferase assay
The shRNA containing vectors targeting ALDH1A3,
ALDH1A1, ALDH2 and the scrambled non targeting
control vector were previously described [14]. The
viral vectors were transfected into 293T packaging
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. 48hours later the viruscontaining supernatants were filtered (0.45 µM) and used
to infect the recipient MPM cell lines. Where possible, the
infected cells were selected by puromycin (1 μg/ml every
48 h for 1 week). CHOP promoter/pmCherry-1(#36035,
Addgene, Cambridge, MA) was transfected into MPM
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To evaluate
the ALDH1A3 promoter transcriptional activity, we
used a Luciferase reporter construct (SwitchGear, Active
Motif Carlsbad, CA), transfected into cells, according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase activity was
measured using the Light Switch Assay reagent (Active
Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA.)

RNA interference

Immunofluorescence microscopy

STAT3, CEBPβ, NFkB (p65-RelA) targeting
siRNA (TRILENCER-27 siRNAs) were from Origene
Technologies (Rockwille, MD, USA) and were transfected
with siTRAN siRNA transfection reagent following
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested at 24hrs
(for RNA extraction) or 48hrs (for protein studies)

Briefly, the cells were fixed and permeabilized
in paraformaldehyde/methanol, non-specific binding
blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 hour at
room temperature and labeled with a mouse monoclonal
anti-DDIT3 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The secondary
antibody was an anti-mouse IgG Texas red (Abcam). Cell
nuclei were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) staining. For counting the mCHERRY positive
cells, a minimum of 8 fields (containing ≥40 cells) was
counted in duplicate experiments. Quantification of
fluorescence was performed in ImageJ® and the number
of cells with a mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) above the
threshold (set on untransfected cells) was reported were
indicated.

ALDH activity assay and cell sorting
ALDEFLUOR kit (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. ALDH-positive cells were
defined as the cells that displayed greater fluorescence
compared with a control staining reaction containing the
ALDH inhibitor, DEAB (diethylaminobenzaldehyde),
upon addition of the synthetic ALDH substrate BAAA.
Cell sorting was performed using a FACSAria flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mississauga, Canada).
Dead cells positive to SYTOX Red Dead Cell Stain (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) were excluded.

Apoptosis detection
Dead cells were measured by FACS analysis after
SYTOX Dead Cell Stain-labeling (Life Technologies,
Gran Island, NY USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The Human Apoptosis Antibody Array (R&D,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used to simultaneously
detect the relative expression of 35 apoptosis-related
proteins.

Colony forming assay (CFA)
MPM cell lines were grown to 70% confluence and
pulse- treated with the indicated drugs or transfected as
indicated. 16hrs later, cells were detached and seeded at
500-1500 cells/well into 6-well dishes in drug-free media
(2ml medium /well). Fresh medium (25%) was added
every three days. Colonies were stained with crystal violet
(SIGMA) and colonies (>50 cells) counted after 7- 14 days
(this wide range reflects differences in the proliferation of
the colonies for each MPM cell line). For 3D clonogenic
assays, the cells were plated in anchorage independent
and serum free conditions in DMEM-F12/1:1 + Glutamax
supplemented with BSA and EGF(10ng/ml) and FGF2(10
ng/ml) (Life Technologies) as previously described[61].

Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation and western
blotting
Briefly, cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5% IGEPAL AC-630, 150 mM
NaCl, 1mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol, supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, to generate
total cell extracts. For the immunoprecipitation studies
the following antibodies were used: mouse antiCHOP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-STAT3
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), rabbit antiphosphoSTAT3(tyr705)(Cell Signaling), mouse-antiCEPBβ, rabbit-anti-NFKB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
For the western blotting: rabbit anti- CHOP, rabbit
anti-CEPBβ (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), goat
anti-ALDH1A3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit
anti-p-STAT3 (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-STAT3 (Cell

CA, USA), mouse anti-ALDH1 (this antibody mainly
recognizes ALDH1A1) (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA),
rabbit anti-ALDH1A3 (Abgent, San Diego, CA, USA)
were used. Rabbit anti-ACTIN staining (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or mouse anti-GAPDH (Pierce, Rockford,
IL, USA) were used as a loading control. For the
chemiluminescent detection of the secondary antibodies, a
Western Bright ECL HRP substrate (ADVANSTA, Menlo
Park, CA,) was used. Please note that for the western

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis and gene
expression
Total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy

(Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was measured
by real-time PCR using the SYBRGreen dye (Applied
Biosytems) on a Step One instrument (Applied
Biosytems). Specific primers for ALDH isoforms
were described previously[14]. DDIT3 primers were:
forward: -GGAAACAGAGTGGTCATTCCC; reverse:

supersensitive detection reagent was used (WesternBright
Sirius HRP substrate) given the low amount of material
available. Densitometry was performed on scanned
western blotting images using the ImageJ® software.
Relative intensity for each protein band was reported after
normalization to its loading control, where indicated in the
figure legend.

The specific primers for the CEBPβ binding site in the
ALDH1A3 promoter (chr15: 101419959-101419973) and
for the STAT3 binding site in the DDIT3 promoter (chr12:
57911053-57911074) and the “off target” controls (Epitect

Valencia, CA).

ALDH1A3 and DDIT3 promoter analysis

DNA affinity precipitation assay

Promoter analysis was performed using the
MatInspector software (http://www.genomatix.de) and
MATCHTM, BIOBASE. A sequence 2 kb upstream and 2 kb
downstream from the transcription start site was analyzed
for the presence of putative binding sites for each TF.

Briefly, cells were collected in cold PBS/ 2 mM
EDTA and lysed in DAPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8, 0.5% IGEPAL-AC-630, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2 and 10% glycerol), supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors to generate
total cell extracts. Cell extracts were diluted three times
in IP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5
mM EDTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 10% glycerol) with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors and incubated with
the 5’-biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides (2.5 µg/0.5 mg
cell lysate) complexed to streptavidin-agarose magnetic
beads in IP buffer at 4°C for 2 h. The oligo-beads complex
was washed 5 times with washing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8, 0.5% IGEPAL-AC-630, 175 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM
MgCl2 and 5% glycerol) and eluted with Laemmli buffer
at 65C for 5 minutes. The sequence of the oligonucleotide
isbiotin-5-TCTTCATTTCCAGGAGGTGAAA-3.
As a control 10 µg of competitor non-biotin-labeled
oligonucleotide were preincubated with the nuclear extract
before adding the biotin-labeled one as described above.

Animal studies
All animal work was performed in accordance
with NYU guidelines and upon IACUC approval.
Suspensions of 3 × 106 MSTO-211H cells were injected
subcutaneously. in PBS1X into 5-weeks-old male NOD/
SCID mice (Charles River, Italy). Body weight and
clinical signs of the mice were determined every 3 days.
When tumor volume ≥ 150mm3, mice were randomized
and treated intraperitoneally with vehicle (V, 20%
DMSO/80% corn oil), butein (B, 5mpk), pemetrexed +
cisplatin (P+C: 45mpk + 7mpk, respectively) and butein
+ pemetrexed+ cisplatin (B+P+C 5mpk+45mpk+7mpk,
respectively). Treatment (4 i.p injections at day 1,3,5,7)
started when the tumor ≥ 150mm3 in volume (day 0, n=6
mice/group).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP)

Statistical analysis

SimpleChIP® Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit
Magnetic Beads(Cell Signaling) was used according to
the manufacturer’s instructions except that the supernatant
of the digestion reaction (Micrococcal Nuclease) was not
discarded and used for the immunoprecipitation cocktail
Briefly, 150 μg of crosslinked/sonicated chromatin was
incubated with antibody overnight at 4°C. Antibodies
used were as follows: mouse anti-STAT3 and rabbit antiCEPBβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA);
anti-pSTAT3(Tyr705), rabbit-anti-NFkB (Cell Signaling)
and the negative control Normal Rabbit IgG samples (Cell
Signaling) . CHIP Grade Protein G Magnetic Beads were
added to the samples after BSA blocking and incubated
for 4 h at 4°C with rotation. After several washes (low
salt and high salt), complexes were eluted and DNA crosslinking reversed. DNA was purified using Spin Columns.
Quantitative PCR for CHIP analysis was performed
as indicated before, by using SYBR green (Applied
Biosystems). Fold-change enrichment (relative to a 2%
input chromatin) was calculated using the formula: Percent
Input = 2% x 2^(C[T] 2%Input Sample – C[T] IP Sample).
