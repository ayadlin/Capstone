ABSTRACT
Snake venom toxin (SVT) from Vipera lebetina turanica contains a mixture of
different enzymes and proteins. Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) is known to be a stimulator
of lung cancer cell growth. PRDX6 is a member of peroxidases, and has calciumindependent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) activities. PRDX6 has an AP-1 binding site in
its promoter region of the gene. Since AP-1 is implicated in tumor growth and PRDX6
expression, in the present study, we investigated whether SVT inhibits PRDX6, thereby
preventing human lung cancer cell growth (A549 and NCI-H460) through inactivation
of AP-1. A docking model study and pull down assay showed that SVT completely fits
on the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) region of c-Fos of AP-1. SVT (0–10 μg/ml) inhibited
lung cancer cell growth in a concentration dependent manner through induction of
apoptotic cell death accompanied by induction of cleaved caspase-3, -8, -9, Bax,
p21 and p53, but decreased cIAP and Bcl2 expression via inactivation of AP-1. In an
xenograft in vivo model, SVT (0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg) also inhibited tumor growth
accompanied with the reduction of PRDX6 expression, but increased expression
of proapoptotic proteins. These data indicate that SVT inhibits tumor growth via
inhibition of PRDX6 activity through interaction with its transcription factor AP-1.

(NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, and can
be further classified as nonsquamous carcinoma (including
adenocarcinoma, which accounts for 40% of NSCLCs)
and squamous NSCLC, which makes up 30% of NSCLC
cases [2–4]. Inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) are used for the treatment of NSCLC [5].
In addition, other inhibitors such as miR-99a and heat

shock protein 90 (HSP 90) have  been  also  involved  in
lung tumor development. Down-regulation of miR-99a
is significantly associated with last-stage and tumor
metastasis in NSCLC patients. Further functional
experiments found that overexpression of miR-99a inhibit
cell proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC
cells in vitro and tumor metastasis of NSCLC in vivo [6].
HSP 90 is of considerable interest because tumor cells and
oncogenic proteins are acutely dependent on its activity,
and the HSP90 inhibitor is currently being clinically
tested against a wide array of tumor cell lines, including
lung cancer cell lines [7]. A proteomics analysis study
suggests that the expression of cytokeratine 8, Y-box
binding protein 1 (YB-1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA), non-metastatic protein 23 (Nm23) were also
significant in lung cancer development [8].
PRDX6, a 1-Cys PRDX, is a bifunctional protein
that acts both as glutathione peroxidase and calciumindependent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) [9, 10]. The
mammalian PRDXs family is composed of six members,
PRDX1–6. PRDXs 1–5 have two catalytically active
cysteines, while PRDX6 is the sole 1-Cys member
PRDXs function together to detoxify ROS and thus
provide cytoprotection from internal and external
environmental stress [11, 12]. A lot of research about
correlation to the occurrence of cancer and the PRDXs
family has been performed. Recent studies reported
elevated expression of PRDX1 in several human cancers,
including esophagus [13], breast [14] and prostate [15].
PRDX2 levels are increased in cervical cancer [16], colon
cancer [17, 18] and metatstaic breast cancer in lung [19].
PRDX3 levels are increased in prostate cancer [20],
lung cancer [21], breast cancer [22] and hepatocellular
caricinoma [23]. PRDX4 levels are increased in
glioblastoma cell [24], prostate cancer [25] and lung cancer
[26]. PRDX5 is expressed in the thyroid gland where it
could act as an antioxidant [27]. PRDX6 expression was
significantly higher in human tissue samples of TSCCs
(tongue squamous cell carcinomas) compared with the
10 corresponding adjacent normal tissues [28]. Other
studies have shown the strong expression of PRDX2
and 3 isoforms in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and
cervical cancer [16]. Previously, we found that PRDX6
accelerates lung tumor progression via increased GPx and
iPLA2 activities [29]. We also found that overexpression
of PRDX6 promotes lung tumor growth via increased
glutathione peroxidase and iPLA2 activities through the
upregulation of the activating protein-1 (AP-1) and Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways [30].
The AP-1 complex is composed of homodimers of
Jun family members (cJun, JunB and JunD), heterodi-mers
of Jun and Fos (cFos, FosL1, FosL2, and FosB), or cAMP
response element-binding protein (CREB)/activating
transcription factor (ATF) family members [31, 32].
AP-1 stimulates genes involved in cancer cell invasion
and metastasis, proliferation, differentiation, and survival
[33, 34]. Of NSCLC patients, the expression of AP-1 in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NSCLC was higher than that in normal lung tissues [35].
Recent studies reported that specific AP-1 blockade by
the dominant negative c-Jun mutant, TAM67, inhibits
the tumor number during the tumor promotion stage of
lung tumorigenesis. Researchers used a transgenic mouse
model directing conditional expression of TAM67 in lung
epithelial cells to determine the effect of AP-1 inhibition
on mouse lung tumorigenesis. [36]. Expression of
Suppressor of AP-1, Regulated by IFN (SARI), as an AP-1
inhibitory protein expression in patients with NSCLC
had a poor prognosis, and over-expression of SARI in
A549 cells inhibited the growth and migration of these
cells [37]. The human PRDX6, as an antioxidant enzyme,
has an AP-1 binding sequence in the promoter region [38].
Thus, AP-1 is significant in the tumor preventing effect of
PRDX6.
SVT of Vipera lebetina turanica is the substance
derived from a natural product that has a diverse effects.
SVT has an anti-inflammatory effect [39], anti-arthritic
effect [40] and anti-cancer effect [41]. Previously, we
demonstrated that SVT has an anti-cancer effect of
prostate [42], ovarian [43], colon [44], lung cancer [45]
and neroblostoma cell [46]. SVT is actually a group of
basic peptides composed of 235 amino acids with six
disulfide bonds formed by 12 cysteines [47] which binds
to cysteine residues of target molecules. Our previous
findings indicate SVT binds to the cysteines of NF-κB
thereby blocking NF-κB activities [48]. This binding
inhibited the tumor promoting capacity in prostate cancer
cells [42]. Our previous study also showed that cysteine
residue (C47) of PRDX6 directly binds to thiacremonone
blunting the lung tumor promoting effect of PRDX [49].
Thus, it is possible that SVT binds to the cysteine residue
of its transcription factor AP-1 in PRDX6, and as a result,
the inactivation of PRDX6 inhibits lung cancer cell
growth.
However, cancer cell growth inhibitory effects and
possible mechanism of SVT in lung cancers has not been
studied yet. In the present study, we evaluated anti-tumor
effects of SVT in lung cancer cells through blunting AP-1
activity of PRDX6.

RESULTS
Effect of SVT on cell growth and apoptotic cell
death in lung cancer cells
To assess the inhibitory effect of SVT on cell growth
of lung cancer cells; A549 and NCI-H460, we analyzed
cell growth by MTT assay. Morphologic observation
showed that the cells were gradually reduced in size
and changed into a small round single cell shape with
the treatment of SVT in A549 cells and NCI-H460 cells
(Fig. 1A and  1B). The cells were treated with several
concentrations of SVT (1, 5 and 10 μg/ml) for 72 hr. As
shown in Fig. 1C and 1D, SVT inhibited growth of lung
cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner with

were treated with SVT for 24 hr, and then labeled with DAPI and TUNEL solution. Total number of cells in a given area was determined by
using DAPI nuclear staining (fluorescent microscope). The green color in the fixed cells marks TUNEL-labeled cells. The apoptotic index
was determined as the DAPI-stained TUNEL-positive cell number/total DAPI stained cell number (magnification, 200×) E and F. Values
were means ± S.D. of three experiments. *(P ≤ 0.05) indicates statistically significant differences from the control cells.

IC50 value of 6.8 μg/ml in A549 cells, and IC50 values of
6.8 μg/ml in NCI-H460 cells, respectively. We performed
DAPI staining followed by TUNEL staining assays,
and then the double labeled cells were analyzed by a
fluorescence microscope to determine the inhibition of cell
growth by SVT was due to the induction of apoptotic cell
death. Reversely, consistent with cell growth inhibitory
effects, apoptotic cell death was significantly increased
in SVT treated A549 and NCI-H460 lung cancer cells,
respectively. The number of apoptotic cells (DAPIpositive TUNEL-stained cells) in A549 and NCI-H460
human lung cancer cell cultures was increased to about
62% and 73% of cells, respectively, at a concentration of
10 μg/ml (Fig. 1E and 1F).

indicated that tectochrysin interacted with cell lysates
containing c-Fos from A549 cells (Fig. 2B). To identify
the binding site of SVT to c-Fos of AP-1, we performed
computational docking experiments with SVT and c-Fos
of AP-1. The best binding mode indicates that SVT binds
in the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) region of AP-1. The
binding pocket is comprised of Gln180, Lys176, Asp174,
Glu173, Asp170 and Gln166 (Fig. 2C) .

Effect of SVT expression of apoptotic
regulatory proteins
The activation of cell death regulatory proteins
including DRs, caspases-3, -8 and -9 as well as Bax, leads
to apoptosis in cancer cells. To figure out the expression
of cell death regulatory proteins by SVT, the expression
of apoptotic proteins was investigated by Western blots.
The expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and
cleaved form of caspase-3, -8, -9, and p21 and p53 were
increased by a treatment of SVT. However, the expression
of PRDX6, Bcl2, and c-IAP1 were decreased by the
treatment of SVT in a concentration dependent manner
(Fig. 3A and 3B).

Effect of SVT on AP-1 activation

we compared the combination treatment of SVT and AP-1
inhibitor (SR11302, 10 μM) with SVT or AP-1 inhibitor
alone. Cancer cells were pretreated with AP-1 inhibitor
(SR11302, 10 μM) 30 min prior to the treatment of SVT
(5 μg/ml), and then assayed cell growth and PRDX6
expression. The combination treatment of SVT with
AP-1 inhibitor greatly inhibited lung cancer cell growth
compared to those by SVT or AP-1 inhibitor alone in
both cancer cells (Fig. 5A). We also found that a much
lower expression of iPLA2 (Fig. 5B) and expression of
PRDX6 (Fig. 5C) occured by the combination treatment
of SVT and AP-1 inhibitor. To further determine the
relationship between PRDX6 expression and lung cancer
cell growth inhibitory effect of SVT, we transfected A549
and NCI-H460 cells with c-Fos siRNA using a transfection
agent. The cells were transfected with 100 nM siRNA of
c-Fos for 24 hr, and then treated with SVT (10 μg/ml) for
another 24 hr. Knock down of c-Fos almost completely

We determined whether SVT can inhibit AP-1 DNA
binding activity. Nuclear extracts from treated cells were
prepared and assayed for AP-1 DNA binding by EMSA.
Lung cancer cells have a strong AP-1 DNA binding
activity, which was attenuated by the treatment of SVT
in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 4A and 4B).
Consistent with the inhibitory effect on AP-1 activity, the
expression in the nucleus protiens c-Jun and c-Fos and the
cytosolic protiens c-Jun and c-Fos, components of AP-1,
were also inhibited (Fig. 4C and 4D).

(Fig.  6C). iPLA2 activity was also inhibited by the

DISCUSSION

cancer cells; SKOV-3 [50]. Suppression of PRDX6 in
Hepa1–6 cells would increase susceptibility to peroxideinduced cell death [51]. Previously, we found that PRDX6
accelates lung tumor progression [29]. Many compounds
showed their anti-tumor activity by modification of
PRDXs activity. Dioscin induces esophageal cancer
cell apoptosis through downregulation of PRDX1 and
6 [13]. Multiple myeloma cell growth was selectively and
significantly reduced by (−)-Epigallocatechin 3-gallate
through the downregulation of PRDXs [52]. 4-amino-5(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3, 4-d]pyrimidine
(PP2) induces apoptosis and decreases the expression
of PRDX3 in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells [22].
We also found that thiacremonone inhibited lung tumor
growth in PRDX6 overexpressed transgenic mice through
downregulation of PRDX6 [49]. These data suggest that
downregulation of PRDX6 could be significant for SVTinduced lung cancer cell growth inhibition.

In the present study, we found that SVT inhibited
cell growth of human lung cancer cells; A549 and
NCI-H460 through the inhibition of PRDX6 activity
via interaction to AP-1. SVT has an anti-inflammatory
effect [39], anti-arthritic effect [40] and anti-cancer
effect [41]. Previously, we demonstrated that SVT has an
anticancer effect of prostate [42], ovarian [43], colon [44]
and neroblostoma cells [46]. Our present study further
demonstrated SVT could be a useful compound to treat
lung cancer.
Our present findings showed that SVT inhibited
lung cancer cell growth through the inhibition of PRDX6
activity via interaction to AP-1. A lot of research has
been performed to demonstrate the relevance between
PRDXs and tumor growth. PRDX6 overexpression

AP-1 stimulates genes involved in invasion and
metastasis, proliferation, differentiation, and survival as
well as angiogenesis [33, 34]. Of NSCLC patients, the
expression of AP-1 in NSCLC was higher than that in
normal lung tissues [35]. It was reported that inhibition of
AP-1 by conditional expression of the dominant-negative
c-Jun mutant in lung epithelial cells decreased tumor
number and overall lung tumor burden in chemically
induced mouse lung tumor models [36]. It was reported
that the nucleotide sequence of the PRDX1 gene has
potential AP-1 sites [38], and PRDX1 promoter region
binds JunB and c-Fos of AP-1 [53]. Most studies related to
identification of responsive elements in the PRDX6 gene
promoter have described several redox-active transcription
factors including a AP-1, suggesting that PRDX6 gene
is also subjected to a complex transcriptional regulation
through AP-1 [54]. Other studies also reported that
promoter region of PRDX6 contains nucleotide sequence
of AP-1 [38]. Previously, we found overexpression of
PRDX6 promotes lung tumor growth via increased
glutathione peroxidase and iPLA2 activities through
the upregulation of the AP-1 and JNK pathways [30].
Knockdown of PRDX1 or PRDX4 significantly reduced
the activation of c-Jun and thus repressed AP-1 mediated
promoter activity, which may contribute to the changes
of lung cancer cell phenotype [55]. Our previous study
also found that higher lung tumor growth in PRDX6overexpressing transgenic mice was associated with
an increase in AP-1 DNA-binding activity [30]. Thus,
inhibition of AP-1 by SVT could be significant for
reduced PRDX6 activity, and thus decreased lung cancer
cell growth. Our present results showed that expression of
PRDX6 via inactivation of AP-1 in A549 and NCI-H460
lung cancer cell were decreased. However, treatment
of c-Fos siRNA in A549 and NCI-H460 reversed SVTinduced lung cancer cell growth inhibition. We also found
that PRDX6 expression was significantly lower in the
SVT treated cultured human lung cancer cells as wells
as xenograft tumor tissues. Lower expression of PRDX6,
iPLA2 and greater cell growth inhibition occured in the
combination treatment of AP-1 inhibitor (SR11302,
10 μM) with SVT compared to those by AP-1 inhibitor
or SVT alone. Through the pull-down assay using SVTagarose bead, we found that SVT bound with cell lysates
containing c-Fos from human A549 lung cancer cells. We
also found a direct interaction of SVT with c-Fos of AP-1
by the docking experiment. Other studies demonstrated
that direct interaction of cyclopentenone 15-deoxyß12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) with 269 cysteine
of AP-1 protein, and thus contribute to the complex
effects of 15d-PGJ2 on the cellular response to proinflammatory agents [56]. Arylstibonic acid NSC13746
binds specifically to c-Fos/JunD dimer of B-ZIP proteins
at micromolar concentrations and can inhibit their
DNA-binding activity both in vitro and in vivo [57].
Expression in the mouse epidermis of A-Fos, a dominant
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

negative form that inhibits AP-1 DNA binding, converts
papillomas into benign sebaceous adenomas that are not
able to convert into carcinomas [58]. In in vivo study
with A549 xenograft bearing mice, treatment of SVT
(0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally twice
a week for 3 weeks) significantly inhibited tumor growth
by approximately 50–60%. The immunohistochemistry
analysis of tumor section by H&E, and by proliferation
antigens against PCNA staining revealed that SVT
inhibited tumor growth. In addition, our data also showed
that SVT inhibited expression of PRDX 6 and AP-1
activity in lung tumor tissues. Also, our data showed that
SVT inhibited expression of AP-1 accompanied with
inhibition of expression of iPLA2 in lung tumor tissues.
Moreover, expression of proapoptotic proteins, cleaved
form of caspase-3 and Bax, was increased and antiapoptotic protein, but expression of Bcl2 was decreased
by treatment of SVT. These data suggest that interaction
of SVT with AP-1 block transcription of PRDX6 thus
inhibiting PRDX6 could be implicated for lung tumor
growth inhibition.
Snake venoms contain complex mixtures of
pharmacologically active peptides and proteins and
thus have a variety of pharmacological effects. Most
significant effect is its anti-inflammatory effect through
inhibition of NF-κB activities and its production of IL-1β,
TNF-α, iNOS and CAM-1 [39]. It has anti-arthritic effect
showing significant restoration in paw & ankle volume,
paw weight, urinary hydroxyproline, glucosamine,
serum ACP, ALP and IL-10 level by SVT treatment [40].
A recent study showed a protective effect of SVT against
LPS-induced septic shock. Survival rate was significantly
higher in SVT-treated rats, compared to that of non-treated
septic rats. Furthermore, SVT treatment also significantly
reduced LPS-associated TNF-α and LDH [59]. In
addition, SVT has anti-tumor effects. SVT inhibited the
proliferation, altered the cell cycle and enhanced the
induction of apoptosis of breast cancer cells by increasing
the activities of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9.
Moreover, SVT sensitized the primary breast cancer cells
to growth arrest and apoptosis by increasing the generation
of free radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS),
hydroperoxide and nitric oxide [60]. In our recent study,
the anti-cancer effect of SVT in cervical cancer via
increase of death receptor 3 and 5 and inactivation of
NF-κB was demonstrated [61]. It was known that the LD50
value for SVT in mice is 2.5 mg/kg [62]. In a previous
study [61] and in the present study, we observed that SVT
(1 mg/kg) did not induce any serious health problems,
such as eruption, swelling, weight loss, or death in the
animals. Thus, the dosage of SVT for cancer treatment
could be safe enough to develop as a drug. In conclusion,
our result that natural toxin SVT could be useful as an
anti-lung cancer agent through inhibiton of PRDX6 by
the interaction with AP-1 which inhibited expression of
PRDX6.

The A549 and NCI-H460 lung cancer cell lines
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) medium supplemented
with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin
(Invitrogen). Cell cultures were then maintained
in  an  incubator within a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37°C.

Cell growth assay
Lung cancer cells, A549 and NCI-H460 cells, were
plated in 96-well plates, and subsequently treated with
SVT 0, 1, 5, 10 μg/mL for 24 hr. After treatment, cell
viability was measured by MTT [3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2, 5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide] assay (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, MTT (5 mg/mL) was added and
plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 hr before 100 μL
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well.
Finally, the absorbance of each well was read at a
wavelength of 540 nm using a microplate reader.

Electro mobility shift assay
The DNA binding activity of NF-κB was
determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA) performed according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations (Promega). In short, A549 and NCI-H460
cells were cultured on 100-mm culture dishes. After
treatment with SVT for 2 hr, the cells were washed twice
with PBS, followed by the addition of 1 ml of phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), and then the cells were scraped into
a cold Eppendorf tube. Nuclear extracts were prepared and
processed for EMSA as previously described. The relative
densities of the DNA-protein binding bands were scanned
by densitometry using MyImage (SLB), and quantified by
Labworks 4.0 software (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA).

Evaluation of apoptotic cell death
TUNEL assay was performed by using the
DeadEndTM Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega,
Madison, Wisconsin, USA) for in situ detection
of apoptotic cells, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Lung cancer cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were
cultured on 8-chamber slides, after cells were treated
with SVT. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed by
incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min
at room temperature. Membrane was permeabilized by
exposure to 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room
temperature. For DAPI staining, slides were incubated for
15 min at room temperature in the dark with a mounting
medium for fluorescence containing DAPI (Vector
Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The cells were
then observed through a fluorescence microscope (Leica
Microsystems AG, Wetzlar, Germany). The total number
of cells in a given area was determined by using DAPI
and TUNEL staining. The apoptotic index was determined
as the number of DAPI-stained TUNEL-positive cells
divided by the total number of cells counted × 100.

Transfection of siRNA
Lung cancer cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were plated in
96-well plates and transiently transfected with c-Fos siRNA,
using a mixture of siRNA and the WellFect-EX PLUS
reagent in OPTI-MEN, according to the manufacturer’s
specification (WelGENE, Seoul, Korea). The transfected
cells were treated with 10 μg/ml SVT for 24 hr or 1 hr and
then used for detecting cell viability and protein expression
(1 hr culture) and AP-1 activation (1 hr culture).

Docking procedure
The docking of AP-1 transcription factor with
cobrotoxin was performed using a rigid-body docking

22147

Oncotarget

Animal experiment

program ZDOCK 3.0.2 on ZDOCK server (http://
zdock.umassmed.edu) [63]. ZDOCK server allows easy
and fast production of structural models of proteinprotein complexes. AP-1 transcription factor from PDB
ID:1FOS was used for the docking. Only one set of fosjun heterodimer was selected and the duplex DNA bound
to fos-jun heterodimer was not included in the docking
experiments to allow full search of binding interface
for the other protein counterpart. Only one monomer of
Cobrotoxin was selected from PDB ID: 1V6P. Docking
experiments were performed without selection or blocking
of residues.

To conduct in vivo studies, male BALB/c nude
mice (aged 6–7 weeks, weighing 20–25 g) were used.
Nude mice were housed under specific pathogen free
conditions according to the guidelines of the Animal
Care Committee at the Chungbuk National University
(CBNU-278-11-01). On day 0, A549 cells in PBS
(2  ×  107 tumor cells/ 0.1 ml PBS/ani-mals) were
injected subcutaneously into nude mice. The mice were
divided into three groups (n = 6). SVT (0.5 mg/kg and
1 mg/kg) was administrated intraperitoneally twice per
week for 3 weeks to mice with tumors ranging from
100 to 300 mm3. Tumor volumes were estimated by the
formula: length (mm) × width (mm) × height (mm)/2 at
the end of experiment.

Pull down assay
SVT was conjugated with cyanogen bromide
(CNBr)-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO). Briefly, SVT (1 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of coupling
buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3 and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 10. The CNBractivated Sepharose 4B was swelled and washed in 1 mM
HCl through a sintered glass filter, then washed with the
coupling buffer. CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads
were added to the SVT-containing coupling buffer and
incubated at 4°C for 24 hr. The SVT-conjugated Sepharose
4B was washed with three cycles of alternating pH wash
buffers (buffer 1, 0.1 M acetate and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 4.0;
buffer 2, 0.1 M Tris-HCl and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0). SVTconjugated beads were then equilibrated with a binding
buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5). The
control unconjugated CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads
were prepared as described above in the absence of SVT.
The cell lysate was mixed with SVT conjugated Sepharose
4B or Sepharose 4B at 4°C for 24 hr. The beads were then
washed three times with TBST. The bound proteins were
eluted with SDS loading buffer. The proteins were then
resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with
antibodies against c-Fos (1:2000 dilutions; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

Immunohistochemistry
All tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
cut into 4 μm sections using a freezing microtome. The
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
for pathological examination. For immunohistological
staining, tumor sections were incubated in primary
antibody. After rinse in phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
the sections were subject to incubation in biotinylated
secondary antibody. After the slides were washed and
developed with DAB, the slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin, mounted in aqua-mount, and evaluated on
a light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Sections
were dehydrated in a series of graded alcohols, cleared in
xylene and coverslipped using Permount (Fisher Scientific,
Suwanee, GA).

Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism
4 ver. 4.03 software (GraphPad Software). Data were
presented as mean ± S.D. The differences in all data
were assessed by one-way analysis of variance. When
the p  value in the ANOVA test indicated statistical
significance, the differences were assessed by the
Dunnett’s test. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Measurement of iPLA2
Lysate of tumor tissue were used. Lysate of
tumor tissue were obtained through protein extraction
buffer containing protease inhibitor. iPLA2 levels
were determined using each specific ELISA Kit (Cloud
Clone Corp.). In brief, 100 μl of sample was added into
a precoated plate and incubated overnight at 4°C. After
washing each well of the precoated plate with a washing
buffer, 100 μl of labeled antibody solution was added,
and the mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 4°C in the dark.
After washing, chromogen was added, and the mixture
was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the
dark. Finally, the resulting color was assayed at 450 nm
using a microplate absorbance reader (SunriseTM, Tecan,
Switzerland) after adding stop solution.
