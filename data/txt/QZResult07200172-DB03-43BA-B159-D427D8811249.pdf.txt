BACKGROUND. The authors evaluated the response rate, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of topotecan given before standard induction therapy for childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first relapse.

METHODS. Patients received topotecan (2.4 mg/m2 daily as a 30-minute infusion)
for 5 days before induction therapy with dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase (native or pegylated Escherichia coli). The pharmacokinetics of topotecan were measured with the first dose of treatment in 23 patients.

RESULTS. Twenty-eight of 31 patients with circulating blast cells were evaluable
for response to topotecan. Twenty-five patients (89.3%) had a response (>25%
decrease in circulating blast cells). The leukocyte count (P 5 .0001) and blast cell
count (P 5 .0009) declined significantly during topotecan therapy. The median
(range) topotecan lactone area under the concentration-time curve after the first
dose was 85.4 L/hour/m2 (range, 38.7–229.3 L/hour/m2). At the end of induction,

response, 5 patients (16.1%) had no response, and 2 patients had died of infecachieved MRD-negative status at the end of induction. The main toxicities were
hematologic, gastrointestinal, and hepatic. The estimated 5-year survival rate,
event-free survival rate, and cumulative incidence of second relapse were
24.1%  7.9%, 18.2%  7.4%, and 22.8%  8.7%, respectively, in the 29 patients
who had a hematologic first relapse.

CONCLUSIONS. A regimen comprising single-agent topotecan given with a standard 3-drug combination was effective in inducing remission in pediatric patients
with relapsed ALL and was tolerated well. Cancer 2008;112:1983–91.  2008

resistance and the lower tolerance of treatment that
results from prior chemotherapy in this patient
population.3 Although from 40% to 50% of patients
with late first bone marrow relapse may survive,
<20% of patients are long-term survivors after early
relapse.2–5 Induction of remission is the first crucial
stage for successful retrieval treatment. In previously
reported studies, the complete remission (CR) rate
was >90% for late bone marrow relapse and from
75% to 85% for early bone marrow relapse.3,4
Increased intensity of contemporary frontline therapy
may make salvage therapy more difficult, because
leukemic blast cells may become more resistant to
chemotherapy than they do in patients who are treated less intensively.3 A new agent that has a novel
mechanism of cytotoxicity and preferably less crossresistance is needed to improve outcome.
Topotecan is a semisynthetic camptothecin derivative that inhibits the intracellular enzyme topoisomerase I and induces damage to the cells during
DNA replication.6 It has demonstrated antitumor
effects on various malignant diseases in preclinical7
and clinical studies.8–10 In previous Phase I studies,9,11 topotecan as a single agent exhibited activity
against relapsed ALL in children. In Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) studies 9275 and 9575, topotecan
produced 1 CR and 2 partial remissions (PRs) in 25
patients with ALL who were unresponsive to conventional therapy.9 It has been demonstrated that topotecan also has antileukemic effects against ALL in
adults.12,13
A topotecan-containing regimen is particularly
attractive for the treatment of relapsed ALL for several reasons. First, it minimizes the necessity for
anthracyclines. Second, the absence of cross-resistance between topotecan and agents commonly used
in ALL therapies is advantageous, because cellular
drug resistance is a major determinant of the prognosis of patients with relapsed ALL.14 In the current
study, we investigated the efficacy of topotecan and
subsequent standard 3-drug induction therapy (dexamethasone, vincristine, and Escherichia coli [E. coli]
or pegylated [PEG] asparaginase) in children with
ALL in first relapse.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The St. Jude ALL-R16 protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital, and informed consent was
obtained from each patient, parent, or guardian. The
study was open for enrollment between 1997 and
2003. Patients with first hematologic relapse (isolated

or combined with disease at extramedullary sites) of
ALL or those with relapsed T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had >25% blast cells in their bone marrow were enrolled in this study. Monitoring of
minimal residual disease (MRD) was performed by
flow cytometry as described previously.15,16

Treatment
The details of the treatment protocols are depicted
in Table 1. Topotecan (2.4 mg/m2 intravenously [IV]
over 30 minutes daily) was given as a single agent in
a 5-day window period. In the POG 9575 study for
patients with refractory leukemia, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single-agent topotecan was 2.4
mg/m2 in a 9-day regimen.9 In the current study, the
duration was reduced to 5 days to avoid excessive
toxicity when topotecan was combined with other
agents. On Day 8, standard induction therapy, which
consisted of dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase, was started. At the time of study entry,
patients were assigned randomly to receive either
native E. coli asparaginase or PEG asparaginase for
comparison of asparagine depletion by the 2 agents
(this analysis will be reported separately). Triple intrathecal therapy (methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and
cytarabine) was given in age-dependent doses as
central nervous system (CNS)-directed treatment on
Days 8 and 22 and at the end of induction to
patients with no CNS leukemia; and it was given
weekly to patients with CNS leukemia until blast
cells were absent from cerebrospinal fluid obtained
by 2 consecutive lumbar punctures. Bone marrow
aspiration was done before the start of induction
therapy and at the completion of induction therapy.
The patients who had appropriate donors were
offered allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Other patients continued to receive chemotherapy, including primary consolidation therapy,
secondary consolidation therapy, and continuation
therapy. Primary consolidation consisted of combined fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor); and secondary consolidation
consisted of etoposide and vincristine. Continuation
therapy consisted of 2 modules of intensive chemotherapy (total, 4 months) followed by standard continuation therapy with an additional intensive module
(17 months). Each module of intensive continuation
therapy consisted of 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Continuation therapy consisted of rotational drug pairs
given in 4 weekly cycles. Toxicity was graded in accordance with the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0.

Given weekly to patients with CNS leukemia until blast cells were absent from cerebrospinal fluid in 2 consecutive lumbar punctures.
§
The first dose of G-CSF was given within 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy, and the treatment was continued until neutrophil count recovery.

Pharmacokinetic Methods
Sample collection, preparation, and high-performance
liquid chromatography
Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were
obtained from consenting patients on Day 1 of the
first course before the topotecan dose was given and
at 0.25 hour, 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 3 hours, and 6 hours
after the end of the infusion. At each time point, 3 mL
of blood were collected from a site contralateral to

the site of IV infusion of topotecan and were placed
in a heparin-containing tube. Within 2 minutes after
collection, the blood sample was centrifuged in a
microfuge for 2 minutes at 310,000 g. Plasma was
separated, and 200 lL were added to 800 lL of cold
(230 8C) methanol. The methanolic mixture was
vortexed for 10 seconds and then centrifuged for
2 minutes at 310,000 g. The supernatant was decanted into a screw-top tube and stored at 280 8C

until it was analyzed by isocratic high-performance
liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection,
as described previously.17–20 Topotecan was detected
by a fluorescence detector (Shimadzu RF535; Columbia, Md) with excitation at 370 nm and emission
at 520 nm. Calibration curves were constructed by
using human plasma from a single donor. The minimum detectable topotecan lactone concentration
and total plasma topotecan concentrations were
0.25 ng/mL.

Pharmacokinetic analysis
A 2-compartment model was fit to the topotecan lactone concentration-time data by using maximum
likelihood estimation as implemented in ADAPTII.20
Model parameters that were estimated included the
volume of the central compartment (Vc), the elimination rate constant (ke), and the intercompartment
rate constants (kcp, kpc) for IV administration. Systemic clearance (CL) was calculated by using standard equations, and the area under the concentrationtime curve (AUC) from zero to infinity (AUC0?1) for
topotecan was calculated by integration of the simulated concentration-time data from model estimates.
Statistical methods
The exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare 2 independent, continuous distributions, and
the exact Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to
determine whether 2 distributions of continuous,
paired data collected at 2 time points differed. The
exact Spearman rank-correlation coefficient was used
to determine whether relations existed between 2
continuous variables, and the Fisher exact test was
used to determine whether associations existed
between 2 dichotomous variables. Asymptotic P
values were reported when problems were too large
for analysis by exact software.
The main outcome measures were estimates of
event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and
cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). The duration
of EFS was measured from the date of CR to the date
of first treatment failure of any kind (relapse, death,
ALL lineage switch, or second malignancy) or to the
date of the most recent follow-up. Failure to induce
remission was considered an event at zero time. The
duration of OS was calculated from the date that the
patient enrolled on the study to the date of death
from any cause or the date of the most recent follow-up. Data for patients who remained were alive at
the most recent contact date were censored at the
time of that contact. EFS and OS distributions were
estimated by using the method of Kaplan and
Meier21 and were compared by using the exact log-

rank test implemented in StatXact-7 (StatXact-7 for
Windows 2005; Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, Mass). Cox proportional hazards models that
included transplantation as a time-dependent covariate and were stratified for treatment arm were used
to investigate the association of EFS and OS with age
at diagnosis, white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis, sex, time to relapse, relapse site, and immunophenotype of relapse. Any leukemia relapse was
included in the analysis of the CIR; failures to induce
remission, or the occurrence of a second cancer, or
deaths from any cause were regarded as competing
events. Patients who remained alive with their disease in remission were censored at the time of last
follow-up. The risk of relapse and competing risks
were estimated as described by Prentice et al.22 and
were compared by using the method described by
Gray.23 All reported P values are 2-sided.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the Patients
Thirty-one patients with ALL in first relapse were eligible for this study. The patients’ characteristics are
summarized in Table 2. Twenty-six patients were
treated previously on St. Jude Total Therapy studies
XI,24 XII,25 XIIIA,26 and XIIIB.27 Five patients received
frontline therapies other than those used in these
Total Therapy protocols.
At the time of relapse, the median patients age
was 12.7 years (range, 0.6–21.1 years), the median WBC
count was 6.4 3 109/L (range, 1.5–439.2 3 109/L),
and the median duration of the initial remission was
36 months (range, 3.8–151.0 months). Sixteen
patients had a late relapse (ie, relapse that occurred
6 months after the elective cessation of frontline
therapy) (Table 2). Of the 15 patients who had an
early relapse (ie, relapse during frontline therapy or
<6 months after the elective cessation of frontline
therapy), 3 patients experienced relapse during frontline therapy. Eleven patients had T-cell ALL, 17
patients had B-lineage ALL, and 1 patient had ALL
with an unclassifiable immunophenotype. No differences were observed in patient characteristics
between the E. coli asparaginase arm (n 5 16
patients) and the PEG asparaginase arm (n 5 15
patients; data not shown).
Responses to Topotecan as a Single Agent During the
First Week
An oncolytic response was defined as a decrease
25% in the circulating blast cell count on Day 6 (or
Day 7). Of 31 patients, 2 patients with isolated testicular relapse and 1 patient with bone marrow relapse

but no circulating blast cells were excluded from this
analysis. Twenty-five of 28 patients (89.3%) who had
circulating blast cells had an oncolytic response (Table 3). Two patients were missing data for leukocyte
counts, and 5 patients were missing data for blast
counts; therefore, the degree of cytoreduction by
topotecan administered as a single agent was evaluated for the remaining 26 patients and 23 patients by
analyzing peripheral blood cell counts and blast
counts, respectively, on Day 0 (prechemotherapy)
and Day 6 (Day 7 or 8 if no Day-6 data were available). Significant reductions occurred in WBC counts
between Day 0 (median, 6.4 3 109/L; range, 1.5–
439.2 3 109/L) and Day 6 (median, 1.95 3 109/L;
range, 0.7–41.3 3 109/L; P 5 .0001). There also was a
significant reduction in the percentages of blast cells
between Day 0 (median, 14.0%; range, 0%–91.0%)

1987

and Day 6 (median, 1.0%; range, 0%–94%; P 5 .002)
and in absolute blast cell counts between Day 0 (median, 0.87 3 109/L; range, 0–329.4 3 109/L) and Day
6 (median, 0.02 3 109/L; range, 0–38.8 3 109/L;
P 5 .0009).

Response to Remission Induction Therapy
Twenty-three of 31 patients (74.2%) attained CR at
the end of the 5-week induction period (Table 3). PR
was observed in 1 patient (3.2%), and 5 patients
(16.1%) had no response. Two patients (6.5%) died
on Day 17 and Day 32 of induction therapy because
of infection: 1 patient had Bacillus cereus sepsis, and
the other patient had sepsis and meningitis caused
by Bacillus cereus and Candida species. Of the 29
patients who had bone marrow relapse, 21 patients
(72.4%) attained a second CR. Both patients with isolated testicular relapse also achieved CR. There was
no significant association between the remission
induction rate and any of the following factors: time
to relapse, site of relapse, immunophenotype, cytogenetic features, asparaginase treatment arm, oncolytic
response after topotecan therapy, and other patient
characteristics (data not shown).
Seventeen patients were studied for MRD at the
end of induction therapy (Day 36). Six patients had
undetectable MRD (<0.01% leukemic cells among
bone marrow mononuclear cells), 5 patients had
MRD 0.01% but <1%, 3 patients had MRD 1% but
<5%, and 3 patients had MRD 5% (Table 3).
Analysis of OS and EFS Rates and CIR
Estimates of the 5-year OS and EFS rates were
24.1%  7.9% and 18.2%  7.4%, respectively, for 29
patients with bone marrow relapse. The estimated 5year OS rates were 42.9%  13.2% for patients with
late relapse and 6.7%  4.6% for patients with early
relapse. The 5-year CIR for all patients was
22.8%  8.7%. Both patients with isolated testicular
relapse remained alive 108 months and 115 months
after CR was achieved.
Acute Toxicities During Induction Therapy
Only 1 episode of grade 3 fever in 31 patients during
the topotecan window therapy was reported. Grade 3
and 4 toxicities during induction therapy are listed in
Table 4. Nineteen patients experienced at least 1 episode of grade 3/4 toxicity. Infection was the most
common toxicity, as expected. Although the topotecan regimen was tolerated well in general, 2 patients
died of infection, as discussed above. In contrast to
findings reported in a previous article,9 gastrointestinal toxicity was infrequent in this patient population.
Other common toxicities were neurologic (11 epi-

was the only type of cardiovascular toxicity that was
observed: Only 1 episode was observed during window therapy, and we believe it was caused by dehydration.

Serial samples for pharmacokinetic studies were
obtained from 23 patients at all time points on Day 1
of Course 1. The remaining 5 patients either declined
to participate in the pharmacokinetic studies or the
data were not available. The median value (range)
for topotecan AUC, clearance, and half-life was 85.4
ng/mL*hour (38.7–229.3 ng/mL*hour), 28.6 L/hour/
m2 (7.9–51.5 L/hour/m2), and 2 hours (1.6–7.3
hours), respectively.

Several investigators have demonstrated that
measures of renal function are important predictors
of topotecan systemic clearance; for example, most
of a topotecan dose (approximately 50–70%) is recovered in the urine.9,28 Thus, when 1 of our patients
presented with evidence of tumor lysis syndrome
and an elevated serum creatinine level, we prospectively monitored the topotecan plasma concentration
and adjusted the topotecan dosage appropriately to
avoid toxicity. This patient had a topotecan systemic
clearance of 10.1 L/hour/m2 and an AUC of 229.3
ng/mL*hour on Day 1. Because the topotecan AUC
was 3-fold higher than the observed median, we
empirically reduced the topotecan dose for this
patient to 30% (from 2.4 mg/m2 to 0.84 mg/m2) on
Day 2 and repeated the topotecan pharmacokinetic

studies. The pharmacokinetic study that was conducted after the dosage change indicated that the
topotecan systemic clearance was similar (7.9 L/
hour/m2) to that observed initially for this patient,
and the AUC decreased to 97.5 ng/mL*hour, a result
more consistent with the median topotecan systemic
exposure observed with this dosage in this population treated with topotecan 2.4 mg/m2.

DISCUSSION
Despite various reports of the use of topotecan to
treat ALL in adults,12,13 very few have reported the
use of topotecan as a single agent9,11 or in multiagent therapy29 in childhood ALL. In the current
study, we confirmed that topotecan possesses considerable antileukemic activity against pediatric ALL
by administering topotecan in an ‘‘upfront window.’’
Single-agent topotecan reduced the WBC count, circulating blast cell percentage, and circulating blast
cell count. The induction regimen with topotecan
followed by the standard 3-drug combination yielded
respectable rates of remission induction in patients
who were treated previously with contemporary multiagent frontline therapies, and the remission rate
was comparable to that associated with anthracycline-containing regimens.
Topotecan did not cause immediate complications during the period of window therapy. With the
exception of 1 episode of fever, no significant toxicities
were observed. The overall induction regimen with

topotecan followed by the standard 3-drug combination was well tolerated. The frequency of grade 3 and 4
toxicities in remission induction was comparable to
that reported in previous studies. In a previous Phase I
study of topotecan, gastrointestinal toxicities were doselimiting.9 In our study, there were only 4 episodes in 3
patients. This difference may be attributed at least in
part to the difference in patient population. Compared
with patients in the Phase I study, who were pretreated
more heavily, our patients were better able to tolerate
the treatment. In addition, the duration of topotecan
therapy was shorter in our study than in the previous
study, in which topotecan was used as a single agent.
Although the remission rate reported here is reasonable, it is not superior to previously published
results for pediatric patients with relapsed ALL.3 This
remission rate observed in our study can be improved
by some measures. In a previous study,9 most
patients who achieved CR or PR received topotecan
for 9 to 12 days; and protracted, intermittent administration was considered more effective than increasing the dose or continuous infusion.10 Indeed,
schedule dependency of topotecan has been reported
in a study using mice with xenografts of human
tumors.7 In the current study, the duration of topotecan therapy was reduced to 5 days (from the 9–12
days in the previous Phase I study) because of concern about possible excessive toxicity when topotecan
was used in combination with other agents. However,
the relatively few toxicities observed with topotecan
in the current study provide support for administer-

ing topotecan on a more protracted schedule, especially in combination with the 3-drug induction regimen. Although gastrointestinal toxicities are more
common with protracted schedules,30 these effects
may be avoided by using prophylactic antibiotics;
Furman et al. reported that coadministration of cefixime with oral irinotecan allowed greater dose escalation of irinotecan.31 Topotecan also can be combined
with topoisomerase II inhibitors or alkylating agents,
which reportedly act synergistically with topotecan.32
The pharmacokinetics of topotecan in this study
were consistent with those observed previously in
children with solid tumors8 and children with ALL.9
We monitored the topotecan plasma concentration
of 1 patient who had renal failure and successfully
adjusted the second dose to 30% of the starting dose
on the basis of a topotecan clearance rate that was
approximately 30% of the population mean. The
resulting topotecan systemic exposure was consistent
with the mean systemic exposure (eg, AUC) of the
other patients enrolled on the study. If topotecan is
used in patients with ALL and tumor lysis syndrome,
then a dosage reduction is highly recommended.
In conclusion, topotecan given in combination
with dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase is
effective in inducing remission in pediatric patients
with relapsed ALL; this regimen is well tolerated
without excessive toxicities. Although the CR rate
achieved by this regimen is not superior to the rates
reported by previously studies, the relatively mild
toxicity profile observed suggests that the response
rate may be improved by giving topotecan on a protracted schedule (eg, over 7–9 days).
