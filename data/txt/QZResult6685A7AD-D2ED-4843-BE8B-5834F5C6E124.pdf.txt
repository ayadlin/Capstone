Abstract
Chemoprevention is a practical and translational approach to reduce the risk of various cancers including
colorectal cancer (CRC), which is a major cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Accordingly,
here we assessed chemopreventive efficacy and associated mechanisms of long-term silibinin feeding on
spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in the APCmin/+ mice model. Six-week-old APCmin/+ mice were p.o.
fed with vehicle control (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose and 0.025% Tween 20 in distilled water) or 750
mg silibinin/kg body weight in vehicle for 5 d/wk for 13 weeks and then sacrificed. Silibinin feeding strongly
prevented intestinal tumorigenesis in terms of polyp formation in proximal, middle, and distal portions of
small intestine by 27% (P < 0.001), 34% (P < 0.001), and 49% (P < 0.001), respectively. In colon, we observed
55% (P < 0.01) reduction in number of polyps by silibinin treatment. In size distribution analysis, silibinin
showed significant decrease in large-size polyps (>3 mm) by 66% (P < 0.01) and 88% (P < 0.001) in middle
and distal portions of small intestine, respectively. More importantly, silibinin caused a complete suppression in >3 mm sized polyps and 92% reduction in >2 to 3 mm sized polyps in colon. Molecular analyses of
polyps suggested that silibinin exerts its chemopreventive efficacy by inhibiting cell proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis; inducing apoptosis; decreasing β-catenin levels and transcriptional activity;
and modulating the expression profile of cytokines. These results show for the first time the efficacy and
associated mechanisms of long-term p.o. silibinin feeding against spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in
the APCmin/+ mice model, suggesting its chemopreventive potential against intestinal cancers including CRC.

Introduction
Chemoprevention has emerged as a pragmatic approach
to reduce the risk of various cancers including colorectal
cancer (CRC), one of the most common malignancies in
the Western world (1). Familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP), a hereditary CRC predisposition syndrome (2), is
caused by mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
gene and is characterized by progressive development of
numerous adenomas in colon progressing to CRC during
later stages (2, 3). Approximately 90% of FAP patients also
develop small intestinal adenomas; overall, these patients
are at ∼330 times higher risk to develop small intestinal
adenomas than normal population (4). Moreover, with increased survival seen in FAP patients following prophylactic
colectomy, small intestinal adenomas are now a common

cause of death in FAP patients (4, 5). Thus, animal models
of intestinal tumorigenesis are needed to study the pathogenesis and to develop the strategies to control the malignancy including chemoprevention. APCmin/+ mouse, one of
the most studied models of intestinal tumorigenesis, harbors a dominant germ line mutation at codon 850 of mouse
homologue of human APC gene, which is similar to that in
FAP patients (6, 7). APCmin/+ mice develop multiple adenomas in whole intestinal tract primarily in small intestine
and fewer in colon (7). Thus, APCmin/+ mouse model is considered an analogue of human intestinal tumorigenesis and
therefore is extensively used in both mechanistic and chemoprevention/intervention efficacy studies (7, 8).
Silibinin is used traditionally to treat various liver conditions and is largely nontoxic (9–11). In the last 20 years,
we have shown silibinin efficacy in various in vitro and
in vivo models of skin, prostate, bladder, and lung cancers
(12–17). Regarding CRC, silibinin exhibits anticancer effects
in HT29 cells in culture (11) and xenografts (18), and its
dietary feeding inhibits azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci formation in rats without any adverse
health effects (19). Together, these results suggested that
silibinin could be an effective chemopreventive agent
against CRC. Accordingly, for the first time, here we
assessed the efficacy and associated mechanisms of longterm silibinin feeding on spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in APCmin/+ mice.

Silibinin Prevents Intestinal Tumorigenesis

Materials and Methods
Animals and chemoprevention study protocol. C57BL/
6J-APCmin/+ and wild-type male mice (age, 5 wk) were from
Jackson Laboratory. Silibinin was from Sigma with >98% purity (20). One week after acclimation, APCmin/+ mice (6 wk)
were divided into two groups of 18 animals each and given
0.2 mL vehicle (0.5% w/v carboxy methyl cellulose and 0.025%
Tween 20 in distilled water) or 750 mg silibinin/kg body
weight by p.o. gavage in 0.2 mL vehicle for 5 d/wk for
13 wk. Negative controls (n = 9 per group) of wild-type
mice were given vehicle or same silibinin treatment as for
APCmin/+ mice. Selection of silibinin dose (750 mg/kg body
weight) was based on published reports (14, 15, 17, 19, 21).
Specifically, silibinin dose is extrapolated from the mice consuming up to 1% (w/w) silibinin in diet that did not show
any apparent toxicity, which we have used in several animal
studies (14, 15, 17, 19, 21). Mice in all groups received AIN76A diet and water ad libitum throughout, and food consumption and mice body weights were recorded weekly.
Animal care and treatments were in accordance with approved protocol and institutional guidelines. Experiment
was terminated after 13 wk of treatment period (at 19-wk
age) to minimize mortality risk caused by severe anemia and
intestinal obstruction, which is more common in APCmin/+
mice at this age (22). Following euthanasia, small intestine
and colon were removed, opened longitudinally, and rinsed
with saline. Small intestine was divided by length into three
equal sections (proximal, middle, and distal segments) and
spread onto microscope slides. Polyps on intestinal segments
including colon were counted, and their sizes were measured
with digital caliper under a dissecting microscope.
Immunohistochemistry staining and quantification.
Paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm thick) were deparaffinized
and stained using specific antibodies followed by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as described (14, 18). Primary antibodies used
were mouse monoclonal anti–proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; 1:250 dilution, Dako), HIF-1α (1:100 dilution,
Novus), and anti-nestin (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz), and rabbit polyclonal anti–cleaved caspase-3 (CC3; 1:50 dilution, Cell
Signaling), anti–vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA; 1:100 dilution, Neomarkers), anti-eNOS (1:100 dilution, Abcam), anti–β-catenin (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz), anti–cyclin
D1 (1:100 dilution, Neomarkers), and anti–cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2; 1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies
used were rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako) and goat anti-rabbit
IgG (Santa Cruz). Apoptotic cells were identified by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining using Dead End Colorometric TUNEL
System (Promega Corp.). PCNA, TUNEL, CC3, nuclear βcatenin, and cyclin D1–positive cells were quantified as described recently (14, 18). eNOS, VEGF, HIF-1α, and COX-2
were quantified by immunoreactivity (represented by intensity of brown staining) and scored as 0 (no staining), +1
(very weak), +2 (weak), +3 (moderate), and +4 (strong) at five
randomly selected fields at 400× magnification in each sample. Newly formed nestin-positive microvessels were quantified as mean number of positive vessels at five randomly

selected fields at 400× magnification in each sample. All microscopic histologic and immunohistochemical analyses
were done by Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Inc.), and photomicrographs were captured by Carl Zeiss
AxioCam MRC5 camera.
Western blot analysis. Tissue lysates of distal part of intestinal polyps from control and silibinin groups were analyzed by immunoblotting (14, 18). Densitometric analyses
of bands are adjusted with β-actin as loading control.
Assay for prostaglandin E2 levels. Small intestinal polyps
were homogenized in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4),
containing 1 mmol/L EDTA and 10 μmol/L indomethacin
with polytron-type homogenizer. Tissue extracts were acidified with HCl to pH 2.5, vortexed for 1 min after adding 1 mL
of ethyl acetate, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min. Organic layer was collected, evaporated under N2, and stored at
−80°C. Each sample was reconstituted in 1 mL enzyme immunoassay buffer (Cayman Chemical) and prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) levels measured using ELISA kit.
Mouse cytokine array. Tissue lysates of intestinal polyps
from three randomly selected animals per group were applied to a mouse cytokine antibody array (RayBiotech, Inc.)
to analyze the expression of various cytokine molecules. Expression of each protein was represented in duplicate on the
membrane, which were scanned and quantified by ScionImage Program, and densitometric data were analyzed using
antibody array analysis tool (RayBiotech, Inc.).
Reporter gene assay. Transcriptional activity of β-catenin
was measured using TOP/FOPFlash reporter activity assay.
HT29 cells were plated to 35% confluency and then cotransfected with 1.2 μg of 8XTOPFLash/FOPFlash (from Dr.
Randall Moon) and 250 ng of pRL-CMV for 12 h. Cells were
then transfected with control or β-catenin siRNA and 12 h
later treated with DMSO or 100 μmol/L silibinin for 48 h.
Luciferase activity was measured using Promega's dual
luciferase reporter assay system. Final reporter activity
was normalized for transfection efficiency using Renilla
luciferase activity.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were done using
SigmaStat software version 3.5 (Jandel Scientific). Quantitative data are presented as mean and SEM. Statistical significance of difference between APCmin/+ control and silibinin
treatment groups was determined by unpaired Student's t
test, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Silibinin feeding prevents intestinal tumorigenesis in
APCmin/+ mice. Silibinin treatment of APCmin/+ mice resulted in a strong inhibition in intestinal tumorigenesis in
terms of decreased polyp number, size, and appearance in
small intestine (Fig. 1A–C). Specifically, control APCmin/+
mice developed 10, 20, and 33 polyps in proximal, middle,
and distal portions of small intestine, respectively; however,
silibinin feeding for 13 weeks significantly prevented polyps
number in these portions of small intestine by 27% (P <
0.001), 34% (P < 0.001), and 49% (P < 0.001), respectively
(Fig. 1A). Size distribution analysis of polyps in small intestine

showed differential silibinin efficacy depending on small
intestine segment and polyp size. For example, silibinin reduced number of <1 mm size polyps by 30% (P < 0.05) in
proximal and 32% (P < 0.001) in distal but no effect in middle segment; 1 to 2 mm size polyps by 19% (P < 0.05) in
proximal, 41% (P < 0.001) in middle, and 45% (P < 0.001) in
distal portions; and >2 to 3 mm size polyps by 32% (P <
0.01) in proximal, 47% (P < 0.001) in middle, and 48%

(P < 0.001) in distal portions (Fig. 1B). Most prominent
silibinin effect was observed on bigger-size polyps (>3 mm),
which decreased by 66% (P < 0.01) and 88% (P < 0.001) in
middle and distal portions, respectively (Fig. 1B).
Regarding its chemopreventive efficacy in colon, silibinin
significantly decreased (55%, P < 0.01) number of colonic
polyps in APCmin/+ mice (Fig. 1A). Silibinin effect was most
profound on colonic polyps size, wherein it very strongly

Silibinin Prevents Intestinal Tumorigenesis

were processed for PCNA, TUNEL, and CC3 staining. Tissue sections from APCmin/+ control and silibinin-treated groups show brown-colored

arrested the growth of larger-size polyps (>2 mm) than
smaller-size (<1 mm and 1-2 mm) polyps (Fig. 1A). Size distribution analysis of colonic polyps showed a strong decrease (92%, P < 0.001) in >2 to 3 mm size polyps in
silibinin-fed group compared with controls (Fig. 1A). In
terms of the incidence, eight mice in control group had
>2 to 3 mm size polyps versus only one mouse in silibinin-fed group (n = 18; data not shown). More importantly,
none of the mice showed >3 mm size polyps in silibinin-fed
group accounting for a complete suppression, whereas 8 of
18 mice in control group showed colonic polyps >3 mm (up
to 3.7 mm) in size (Fig. 1A). Importantly, observed decrease
in larger-size polyps in silibinin-fed group was accompanied
with almost 2-fold increase in <1 mm size polyps and a
slight increase in 1 to 2 mm size polyps, suggesting that

silibinin inhibits the growth and progression of smaller colonic polyps in to the larger ones.
In APCmin/+ mice, all polyps were histologically identified
as adenomas (Fig. 1D); however, their number and diameter
were significantly reduced in silibinin-fed mice. We did not
observe any other histologic changes in crypt-villus axis
between control and silibinin-fed APCmin/+ mice (Fig. 1D).
In wild-type C57BL/6J mice, both control and silibinin-fed
groups did not develop any polyps throughout the intestine,
including colon, and showed normal intestinal histology
(data not shown). Also, silibinin feeding did not show any
considerable change in food consumption and gain in body
weight compared with controls (data not shown) during entire treatment, which is consistent with previous studies
(14, 15, 17–19).

Collectively, above efficacy study results clearly showed
that silibinin feeding strongly prevents number of polyps in
small intestine of APCmin/+ mice together with a significant
decrease in polyp size. Notably, silibinin more strongly prevented incidence, multiplicity, and burden of colonic polyps.
Whereas this effect of silibinin supports its translational potential, it limited our ability to perform mechanistic studies
in colonic polyps because of their fewer numbers (an average
of 1.6 polyps in control APCmin/+ group and 0.76 polyps in
silibinin-fed group) and very small size specifically in silibininfed group. Accordingly, we selected only small intestinal
polyps for mechanistic studies as reported by others (22, 23).
Silibinin feeding inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis selectively in small intestinal polyps of APCmin/+
mice. PCNA, TUNEL, and CC3 are widely used markers/
players for cell proliferation and apoptosis (24, 25). To assess
whether silibinin efficacy is associated with its in vivo antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, all three segments of
small intestine were analyzed for PCNA, TUNEL, and CC3 immunostaining. Microscopic examination of tissue sections
showed a decrease in PCNA (Fig. 2A) but an increase in
TUNEL (Fig. 2B) and CC3-positive cells (immunohistochemical staining data not shown) in polyps from silibinin-fed
compared with control APCmin/+ mice. Quantification of
PCNA staining showed 46% to 63% (P < 0.001) decrease in
proliferation indices; however, TUNEL and CC3-positive cells
increased by 2.4-fold to 3-fold (P < 0.001) in proximal, middle,
and distal segments of small intestinal polyps from silibininfed mice compared with controls (Fig. 2A–C). These results

were further confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2D), wherein densitometric analysis of bands (adjusted with β-actin as
loading control) showed 28% (P < 0.05) decrease in PCNA
expression and 4.5-fold (P < 0.01) increase in cleaved poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) expression in intestinal
polyps from silibinin-treated mice. We did not observe
any difference in PCNA, TUNEL, and CC3-positive cells in
crypt-villus regions throughout small intestine of control
and silibinin-fed APCmin/+ as well as wild-type C57BL/6J
mice (data not shown). Together, these results clearly suggest in vivo antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of
silibinin selectively in polyps during its chemopreventive
efficacy against spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in
APCmin/+ mice.
Silibinin feeding inhibits angiogenesis selectively in
small intestinal polyps of APCmin/+ mice. Neoangiogenesis,
formation of new blood vessels in tumor, plays a critical role
in malignancy (26). Both hypoxia and VEGF are reported as
most predominant and specific factors that stimulate neoangiogenesis. Hypoxia triggers induction of transcription factor
HIF (27). Importantly, HIF-1α, which is induced under hypoxic condition, is considered a primary regulator of VEGF expression and angiogenesis (28). Thus, to determine whether
silibinin affects polyp angiogenesis, we examined HIF-1α and
VEGF expression by immunohistochemistry. Our immunostaining results showed intense immunoreactivity for HIF-1α
and VEGF in small intestinal polyps of APCmin/+ mice but
strongly decreased levels in silibinin-fed group (Fig. 3A
and C). Quantitative data showed that silibinin decreases

Silibinin Prevents Intestinal Tumorigenesis

Figure 4. Silibinin feeding inhibits eNOS expression and nestin-positive microvessels selectively in small intestinal polyps of APCmin/+ mice. Small intestinal
segments were processed for eNOS and nestin staining. Tissue sections from APCmin/+ control and silibinin-treated groups show brown-colored
eNOS-positive (A) and nestin-positive (C) cells in polyps (400×). Quantification of eNOS was done based on its intensity of cytoplasmic brown staining (B),
and microvessel numbers were quantified by measuring nestin-positive cells in five randomly selected fields at 400× magnification (D). Columns, mean
of six animals; bars, SEM. *, P < 0.001 versus control. Polyps from distal portion of small intestine from each group were also analyzed by immunoblotting
for eNOS and nestin levels. Values of band intensity adjusted with β-actin. Sb, silibinin.

HIF-1α and VEGF immunoreactivity scores in polyps by 44%
(P < 0.001) and 49% (P < 0.001) in proximal, 47% (P < 0.001) and
49% (P < 0.001) in middle, and 58% (P < 0.001) and 59% (P <
0.001) in distal portions of small intestine (Fig. 3B and D).
Overexpression of eNOS, which catalyzes the production
of nitric oxide (a key regulator of angiogenesis), is reported
during carcinogenesis, although it is constitutively expressed in vascular endothelial cells (29); VEGF also activates eNOS expression (30). Nestin, a class VI intermediate
filament protein and neuroepithelial stem cell marker, is
expressed on newly formed microvessels (31) and is a
novel angiogenic marker for newly formed blood vessels
in CRC (32). To gain additional mechanistic insights regarding antiangiogenic effect of silibinin, expression of
these two important angiogenic molecules, eNOS and nestin, was also examined by immunohistochemical staining.
We observed intense immunoreactivity for eNOS in polyps
from control APCmin/+ mice but strongly decreased expression in silibinin-fed group (Fig. 4A). Quantification showed
that silibinin reduces eNOS immunoreactivity score in
polyps from proximal, middle, and distal regions of small
intestine by 48% (P < 0.001), 51% (P < 0.001), and 58% (P <
0.001), respectively (Fig. 4B). Regarding nestin, microscopic

www.aacrjournals.org

examination showed numerous nestin-positive microvessels
in polyps from control APCmin/+ mice but a significant reduction in silibinin-fed group (Fig. 4C). Quantification of
nestin-positive cells showed that silibinin also decreases
nestin-positive microvessels by 37% (P < 0.001), 46% (P <
0.001), and 55% (P < 0.001) in the polyps from proximal,
middle, and distal segments of small intestine, respectively
(Fig. 4D). These results were further confirmed by immunoblotting, which showed that silibinin feeding decreases
eNOS and nestin expression by 61% (P < 0.05) and 94%
(P < 0.01) in intestinal polyps, respectively (Fig. 4A and C).
These results suggest that silibinin possibly targets neoangiogenesis through downregulation of HIF-1α, VEGF, eNOS,
and nestin expression for its angiopreventive effects during
spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis. This antiangiogenic effect of silibinin was specific and limited to polyps, because
we did not observe any considerable changes in the expression of these angiogenic factors in crypt-villus regions in
small intestine of control and silibinin-treated APCmin/+ or
wild-type C57BL/6J mice (data not shown). In these controls,
we did not observe any changes in other molecular analyses
described below, and therefore, these results are not mentioned hereafter.

Silibinin feeding modulates β-catenin levels and transcriptional activity and cyclin D1 expression. Alterations
in β-catenin pathway due to loss of APC function is implicated in CRC initiation and progression (33). To assess silibinin effect on β-catenin pathway, expression of β-catenin
and one of its downstream transcriptional targets, cyclin
D1, was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, which showed
strong staining for both nuclear β-catenin and cyclin D1–
positive cells in polyps from APCmin/+ mice control but their
decreased levels following silibinin treatment (immunohistochemical staining data not shown). Quantification of the
staining showed that silibinin decreases nuclear β-catenin–
positive cells by 40% (P < 0.001), 43% (P < 0.001), and 53%
(P < 0.001; Fig. 5A) and cyclin D1–positive cells by 52% (P <
0.001), 53% (P < 0.001) and 54% (P < 0.001; Fig. 5B) in polyps
from proximal, middle, and distal portions of small intes-

tine, respectively. Immunoblot analysis further confirmed
these results, showing that silibinin treatment decreases
β-catenin and cyclin D1 expression by 64% (P < 0.05) and
44% (P < 0.05) in intestinal polyps, respectively (Fig. 5A and
B). To further substantiate our findings that silibinin targets
β-catenin in its efficacy, we also studied silibinin effect on
β-catenin–mediated transcriptional activity using HT29
cells, wherein 100 μmol/L silibinin concentration reduced
TOPFlash reporter activity by 45% compared with DMSO
controls; however, silibinin did not show any effect in decreasing reporter activity when the expression of β-catenin
was reduced by siRNA transfection of HT29 cells (Fig. 5C).
Silibinin feeding decreases COX-2 expression and PGE2
levels in small intestinal polyps of APCmin/+ mice. A positive correlation between COX-2 and β-catenin pathway is
reported during CRC development (34). COX-2 is a key

enzyme in biosynthetic pathway by which arachidonic acid
is converted into five structurally related prostaglandins,
including PGE2 (35). Because both COX-2 and PGE2 are involved in CRC development (36), we next studied silibinin
effect on COX-2 expression by immunohistochemistry and
PGE2 levels by ELISA. Our results showed strong COX-2
immunoreactivity in small intestinal polyps of APCmin/+
mice, which decreased strongly by silibinin treatment (immunohistochemical staining data not shown). Quantification of immunostained cells showed that silibinin
decreases COX-2 immunoreactivity by 39% (P < 0.001) in
proximal, 47% (P < 0.001) in middle, and 57% (P < 0.001)
in distal portions of small intestinal polyps (Fig. 5D). PGE2
levels in small intestinal polyps were elevated (8-fold) compared with those in wild-type small intestinal tissue (data
not shown). Silibinin treatment decreased PGE2 levels in
small intestinal polyps by 37% (P < 0.001; Fig. 5D). These
results indicate that COX-2 could be a potential molecular
target for the chemopreventive effects of silibinin against
polyp growth.

(37). To examine silibinin effect on various cytokines, we
used inflammatory cytokine antibody array to screen intestinal polyps from both control and silibinin-fed APCmin/+
mice (Fig. 6A). We found that among 62 cytokines tested,
silibinin decreased the expression levels of 12 cytokines
and increased the expression levels of four cytokines in
small intestinal polyps compared with controls (Fig. 6B).
Specifically, silibinin decreased the levels of Fas ligand
(1.5-fold), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; 1.9-fold), vascular endothelial adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1; 2.4-fold),
eotoxin-2 (2.4-fold), VEGF (3.7-fold), macrophage colonystimulating factor (M-CSF; 4.1-fold), interleukin-1α (IL1α; 14.9-fold), IL-β (6.0-fold), leptin (7.1-fold), IFN-γ
(7.9-fold), P-selectin (12.5-fold), and leptin receptor (13.9fold). However, the levels of monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1; 5.4-fold), MCP-5 (16.6-fold), IL-4 (7.3fold), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1; 10.3-fold) were increased in intestinal polyps from
silibinin-fed compared with control APCmin/+ mice. These
results indicate that, together with its angiopreventive
effects, silibinin might also act as an immunomodulating
agent, which could further strengthen its chemopreventive efficacy.

Discussion
This is the first study showing chemopreventive efficacy
of long-term silibinin feeding on spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in APCmin/+ mice, a genetically predisposed animal model of human FAP. The key findings of this study
are as follows: (a) silibinin significantly reduced the number
as well as the growth of intestinal polyps and prominently
decreased the incidence of larger colonic polyps in APCmin/+
mice without any adverse health effects; (b) chemopreventive effect of silibinin was associated with a decrease in proliferation and an increase in apoptosis indices in polyps; (c)
silibinin inhibited neoangiogenesis as evidenced by reduced
HIF-1α, VEGF, and eNOS immunostaining and a decrease in
nestin-positive microvessels in polyps; and (d) silibinin decreased β-catenin levels and COX-2 pathways and modulated
various cytokines in intestinal polyps in favor of its chemopreventive efficacy. These results, together with our earlier findings in CRC xenograft (18) and AOM-induced ACF (19) models,
strongly support the chemopreventive efficacy of silibinin in
three different preclinical animal models of CRC, highlighting
their translational significance against human CRC.
Chemopreventive effect of silibinin observed in the present
study was accompanied by its antiproliferative, proapoptotic,
and angiopreventive mechanisms. Excessive cell proliferation
and insufficient apoptosis are often associated with CRC development and progression (38), and the agents modulating
them in neoplastic cells have immense potential in CRC chemoprevention and therapeutic intervention (1). In our study,
silibinin inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis as
evidenced by decreased PCNA-positive and increased CC3positive cells and increased cleaved PARP levels, respectively,
in polyps from silibinin-fed animals. This antiproliferative
and proapoptotic efficacy of silibinin in small intestinal
polyps of APCmin/+ mice could be the underlying mechanisms
for the strong decrease in the number as well as the size of
polyps. Importantly, these effects of silibinin were specific
and limited to polyps and not observed in normal crypt-villus
regions in small intestine of control and silibinin-treated
APCmin/+, as well as in wild-type C57BL/6J mice.
One of the most important observations in present study
was that silibinin strikingly decreased the number of polyps,
which were larger in size (>3 mm in middle and distal portions of small intestine and 2–3 mm and >3 mm in colon),
suggesting that silibinin exerts strong antiangiogenic activity that possibly inhibited the progression of smaller polyps
into larger ones. Neoangiogenesis is triggered when tumors
grow beyond a minimal size (∼2 mm) and agents that inhibit angiogenesis have significant implications for their
clinical uses (26). Overexpression of HIF-1α, VEGF, and
eNOS is well implicated in stimulating neoangiogenesis
(39). Hypoxia and VEGF signaling play a key role in “angiogenic switch” (27, 30), and HIF-1α induction under hypoxic
conditions directly activates a number of proangiogenic factors, including VEGF (28). Positive correlations between
HIF-1α and VEGF expression, and VEGF and eNOS have
also been documented (40). Overexpression of eNOS is
reported during both carcinogenesis and neoangiogenesis,

although it is constitutively expressed in endothelial cells
(29). Consistent with these reports, overexpression of HIF1α, VEGF, and eNOS and increased newly formed microvessel density were observed in intestinal polyps of control
APCmin/+ mice, which were significantly decreased by silibinin treatment. Angiopreventive effect of silibinin observed
in present study corroborates with previous reports showing that silibinin inhibits angiogenesis in various animal
models of carcinogenesis (14, 15, 17, 18). Collectively, these
antiangiogenic mechanisms of silibinin possibly played an
important role in the observed suppression of vascular
growth of polyps in APCmin/+ mice.
Aberrant β-catenin pathway is involved in CRC development (41), and a direct correlation between β-catenin signaling and regulation of angiogenesis is shown in CRC (33).
In the present study, APCmin/+ mice showed increased level
of β-catenin together with increased expression of cyclin
D1, COX-2, and PGE2 in polyps, which were significantly decreased by silibinin treatment. Overexpression of cyclin D1,
a critical oncogene, is directly associated with increased
proliferative index in CRC and results in a more aggressive
cancer phenotype (42). Thus, downregulation of β-catenin
and cyclin D 1 in polyps from silibinin-treated APCmin/+
mice also support their role in antiproliferative mechanism
of silibinin against CRC. Because overexpression of COX-2
and increased PGE2 levels induce endothelial cell proliferation by releasing various angiogenic factors (35, 36), the inhibition of COX-2 and PGE 2 by silibinin could be an
additional mechanism for its angiopreventive effects. Moreover, VEGF and HIF-1α are also downstream targets of βcatenin (43, 44), indicating that downregulation of β-catenin
signaling by silibinin could be an important mechanism for its
antiproliferative as well as antiangiogenic effect in intestinal
polyps of APCmin/+ mice.
Various cytokines are also associated with growth and development of CRC, which could be modulated by COX-2,
PGE2, and proangiogenic factors; some of them are also regulated by β-catenin pathway (45, 46). Tumor-promoting roles
of Fas ligand, TNF-α, VCAM, eotaxin, M-CSF, leptin and its
receptor, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-β, and P-selectin during cancer development are well documented (37). Therefore, we also examined the silibinin effect on the cytokine profile in polyps
using cytokine array analysis, which showed that silibinin decreases the levels of all above-mentioned tumor-promoting
cytokines in polyps of APCmin/+ mice. Conversely, silibinin increased MCP-1 and MCP-5 factors that activate tumoricidal
activity of macrophages in vivo. TIMP-1 and IL-4 are known
antiinflammatory cytokines (47–49), which were also increased by silibinin treatment. Together, these results suggest that immunomodulating effects of silibinin could be
one of its chemopreventive mechanisms; however, additional
studies are needed in the future to support it.
In summary, our results clearly show in vivo antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic, and antiinflammatory
effects of silibinin in polyps, which collectively contribute
to its strong chemopreventive efficacy against spontaneous
intestinal tumorigenesis in APCmin/+ mice. Together with
our previous reports on silibinin efficacy against CRC in
