ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy can cause cachexia, which is manifested by weight loss,
inflammation and muscle atrophy. However, the mechanisms of tumor and
chemotherapy on skeletal muscle proteolysis, remained unclear. In this report, we
demonstrated that tumor-induced myostatin in turn induced TNF-α, thus activating
calcium-dependent and proteasomal protein degradation. Chemotherapy activated
myostatin-mediated proteolysis and muscle atrophy by elevating IL-6. In tumorbearing mice under chemotherapy, supplementation with fish oil and selenium
prevented a rise in IL-6, TNF-α and myostatin and muscle atrophy. The findings
presented here allow us to better understand the molecular basis of cancer cachexia
and potentiate nutrition supplementation in future cancer chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

cachexia, which is manifested with degradation of
myofibrillar proteins [5] and often come with decrease
of protein synthesis [6]. There are three major proteolytic
pathways in skeletal muscle catabolism: 1. The lysosomal
system (e.g. the cysteine protease cathepsin L (CaspL))
that degrades extracellular proteins and cell receptors [7].
2. The calcium-activated system (e.g. calpains I and II)
that is involved in tissue injury, necrosis, and autolysis
[8]. 3. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that functions
along with the calpain system for disassembly/degradation
of muscle myofilaments [9]. The cancer cachexia-induced
muscle loss is multifactorial making cancer therapy
intricate. Cytokines greatly influence development of
cachexia, in which proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and
IL-6 play a much greater role. In the ubiquitin-proteasome
proteolytic pathway TNF-α initiates muscle atrophy
through up-regulating cathepsins (B and L) and ubiquitins
[10]. IκBs however regulate the proteasomal pathway
[11, 12]. Myostatin, an extracellular protein, negatively

Cancer cachexia influences >80% advanced cancer
patients and accounts for 30% cancer-related deaths [1].
Cancer cachexia is defined as >5% weight loss, which
is closely associated with muscle weakness, fatigue,
anorexia, low lean body mass and certain abnormal
physiological symptoms, such as inflammation, anemia,
low serum albumin. The loss of 5%, 10% or 15% of
the total body mass is further graded as mild, moderate
or severe cachexia, respectively. Both the weight loss
and the rate of weight loss are well correlated to cancer
mortality [2]. Apart from the consequences of cancer
per se, chemotherapy also provokes severe anorexia
and weight loss [3]. For example, docetaxel (Taxotere),
a semisynthetic taxane, is used to treat breast, prostate,
and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) [4], while it
otherwise gives rise to serious cachexia.
The loss of muscle masses is a hallmark of cancer

regulates muscle masses [13] by inhibiting myoblast
proliferation [14]. The fact is that myostatin exerts its
effect through down-regulating muscle regulatory factors
MyoD and myogenin [15]. Myostatin then induces
MAFbx/atrogin-1 and the proteasomal activity [16].
While much have been learned, the interplay between lung
cancer and/or chemotherapeutics that bring about muscle
atrophy remain far from clear.
There is so far no effective way to counteract cancerprovoked muscle wasting, while some recent findings may
provide practical solutions. For example, we reported that
nutritional supplementation with a combination of fish
oil [17] and selenium yeast (se) can lessen body weight
loss by enhancing anti-tumor immunity [18]. Fish oil was
also reported able to relieve muscle fatigue [19], thus
improving physical soundness [20]. The skeletal muscle
depletion may partially be ascribed to reduction of plasma
n-3 fatty acids in NSCLC patients [21, 22]. Selenium
(Se) was recently reported to be a chemopreventive agent
[23], which may prevent mammary epithelial cells from
oxidative DNA damage [24] in addition to promoting
cancer cell apoptosis [25].
To address above concerns we first elucidated the

formation of cancer chemotherapy-induced cachexia
through three cachectic models. Our results determined
that TNF-α facilitates development of muscle atrophy
and that IL-6 acts on the onset of proteolysis during
chemotherapy. We concluded that fish oil and selenium
are beneficial to tumor chemotherapy-induced cachexia.

RESULTS
Cachexia parameters in tumor-bearing mice
In animal study, mice were divided into two groups,
severe and moderate cachexia as described previously
(protocol #1) [18]. The former is redefined as >10% body
weight loss for simplicity. In Table 1A, the carcass weight
of the tumor-bearing mice (TB) is lighter than that of
control mice [26]. In terms of tumor weight, the severe
cachectic mice are 2-fold heavier than the moderate (Table
1A). The body weight, however, gained about 10.2%
in normal mice, as opposed to the body weight losses,
5.6% and 19.1%, in moderately and severely cachectic
mice, respectively (Figure 1A). The body weight loss

Figure 1: Final body weight gain for line-1, docetaxel or combined treatment mice. After sacrifice we scaled mice body

weight into two groups according to the body weight loss percentage. The body weight loss >10% or <10% is designated as severe cachexia
or moderate cachexia. (A and C) On day 35 and 42 after tumor implantation, we harvest tumor and subtract tumor weight from final body
weight to calculate the percentage of body weight loss for line-1 (A), docetaxel (B), or combined chemotherapy (C) treatment mice,
respectively. Data show mean ± SD, n = 5–10 mice/group, each value is an average of three independent experiments. *p < 0.05, **p <
0.01, and ***p < 0.001 denote levels of significant differences between groups.

can thereby index the severity of the tumor-induced
cachexia. The loss of muscle/fat (e.g., epididymal fat)
accounts for the major weight loss (Table 1A). Though
anorexia usually comes with cancer cachexia, food
intake made no difference between the experiment and
control groups (Table 1B). Given that inflammation and
hypoalbuminemia are two diagnostic indices for cachexia
[27], the level of albumin in the severe cachectic mice
was not surprised significantly lower (p < 0.05, TModerate
vs. TSevere) than that in the moderate (Table 2A). Serum
TNF-α and IL-6 in the severe cancer group were higher
than those in control, whereas serum IL-1β leveled off in
all groups (Table 2A).

chemotherapy-induced

In Table 1B, the basic indexes, carcass weight, food
intake and serum albumin, significantly decline in the
docetaxel-treated mice. These indexes dropped further in
the high-dose treatment group when compared to those
in control (Table 1B and 2B, protocol #2). Unlike the
untreated tumor mice, the muscle loss was severer than
the fat loss in the chemotherapeutic agent-treated mice
(Table 1A). The final body weight of the normal mice
group gained 1% (Figure 1B). On the contrary, the groups
receiving 2- or 4-does docetaxel lost 5.5% or 11.6% the
body weight, respectively (Figure 1B). After the docetaxel
treatment, the food intake declined, suggesting that
the body weight loss to some degree is due to anorexia
(Table 2B). The levels of serum IL-6 and IL-1β in the

group receiving high-dose docetaxel increased, whereas
the levels of TNF-α in all groups were more or less the
same (Table 2B), suggesting that the docetaxel-induced
cachexia differs from the tumor-induced cachexia.

the effect is model-dependent, two new models were
examined, where mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma
or line-1 cells were subjected to the cisplatin treatment.
As shown in Fig. 2C and D, the numbers of MDSC and
Tregs cells decline in all cell lines treated with cisplatin.
However, the number of NK cells holds unchanged
in models treated with docetaxel. It is known that
immunosuppressive cells suppress antitumorigenesis
of NK cells [28]. To understand if the reduction of
immunosuppressive cells enhances the cytotoxicity of
NK cells, the NK cells isolated from the tumor-bearing
mice were examined. An E/T ratio of 20/1 in the TD
group maximized the efficacy on the NK cytotoxicity test
(*p < 0.05, Figure 2B) when compared to that in the T
group, where only were 25% of line-1 cells stained with
PI. Our results suggest that the cytotoxicity of NK cells
is compromised in the tumor-bearing mice, whereas the
activity can be restored through the chemotherapeutic
agent-mediated reduction of immunosuppressive cells.
Chemotherapeutic mice remained suffering weight
and muscle losses (Figure 1C, Table 1C, 22.8% loss in T
and 47.9% in TD compared with Con group), indicating

Chemotherapy inhibits tumor growth but
promotes cachexia
In Table 1C, the tumor weight of the docetaxeltreated mice drops about 40%, when compared to that
of mice receiving no treatment (Table 1C, protocol
#3). It is well known that tumor burden is proportional
to the number of splenic immunosuppressive cells
[18]. To examine whether the anti-tumor effect of the
chemotherapeutic agent is because of attenuation of the
tumor-induced immunosuppression, we used ELISA
to determine the cell types of splenocytes in mice. Our
examination showed that docetaxel markedly reduced
the numbers of B, MDSC and Treg cells in tumorbearing mice, whereas the numbers of T and NK cells
were unchanged (Figure 2A). In order to know whether

TNF-α and myostatin are associated with tumorinduced skeletal muscle atrophy

that although docetaxel reduces tumor burden it indeed
assists development of side effects. Consistently, both
5-FU and cisplatin treatments had the similar effect
(Figure 2E and F). As shown in Table 2C, docetaxel
arouses anorexia, while there is no difference in food
intake among testing groups. We reasoned that this is
likely due to the docetaxel administration protocol (a
four-day interval injection), as we wanted to minimize
the adverse cytotoxicity of docetaxel. The levels of serum
IL-6 and IL-1β in tumor bearing mice slightly increased
after the docetaxel treatment, suggesting that docetaxel
exacerbates these side effects.

The factors that cause muscle atrophy were
examined, we analyzed cytokines and atrophy-related
genes in tumor-bearing mice. First, western blotting
analysis revealed that: TNF-α was up-regulated in
moderate cachexia mice (Figure 3A and B); the serum
level of IL-6 was significantly elevated, while its
expression in the gastrocnemius muscle remained within
the normal range; the serum level of myostatin in the

and psma3 (a proteasomal protein), were measured by
real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 3B, the mRNAs of
psma3, ubiquitin-ligases MuRF-1 and MAFbX in the
gastrocnemius muscle of the tumor-bearing mice are
up-regulated, suggesting TNF-α is associated with NFκB signaling pathway through TNF receptors [29]. This
reasoning is supported by the fact that up-regulation of
NF-κB is proportional to the increase of TNF-α (Figure

gastrocnemius muscle also increased. Added together,
TNF-α and myostatin are likely the key mediators that
promote proteolysis.
Several signaling pathways have been implicated
in skeletal muscle degradation. To ascertain whether
TNF-α and myostatin intrinsically regulate proteolysis,

3B). One should note that the activation of NF-κB is
chiefly via IκB kinase (IKK)-mediated phosphorylation
[30].
It has been known that myostatin up-regulates the
genes involved in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
through the NF-κB-independent, FoxO1-dependent
mechanism [31]. The FoxO-1 transcription factors can
induce skeletal muscle wasting via regulating the atrophyrelated genes, namely, the ubiquitin ligase MAFbX and
Cathepsin-L [32, 33]. The mRNA and protein levels of
FoxO-1 markedly increased in both moderate and severe
cachectic mice (Figure 3B). Though FoxO-1 is related
to lysosomal atrophy, the mRNA level of cathepsin-L
only slightly increased in our experiment (Figure 3B).
To confirm that the tumor-induced muscle atrophy
truly follows the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, the
expression of ubiquitin ligases was examined by indirect
immunofluorescence assay. As shown in Fig. 3B and C,
the protein levels of MAFbX and MuRF-1 increase in the
gastrocnemius muscle of the tumor-bearing mice. Taken
together, the tumor-induced muscle atrophy is likely due
to elevated levels of TNF-α and myostatin, which act
together to activate NF-κB and FoxO1 so as to amplify
the expressions of calpain (autolysis) and ubiquitin ligases
(ubiquitin-proteasome) (Figure 5E).

It is now clear that myostatin provokes muscle
atrophy through an NF-κB-independent, FoxO1-dependent
mechanism [16] and that IL-6 mediates muscle protein
degradation by enhancing lysosomal cathepsin proteolysis
[34]. Our assays showed that FoxO-1 was up-regulated
and that NF-κB was kept steady in the gastrocnemius
muscle of the docetaxel-treated mice (Figure 4B).
The real-time PCR analysis also demonstrated that
the expressions of ubiquitin ligases and cathepsin-L
increased in the gastrocnemius muscles of normal adult
mice (Figure 4B). The reporter analysis further confirmed
that both lysosomal cathepsin and ubiquitin-proteasome
increased with addition of docetaxel to P19 muscle cells
in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4D). Interestingly,
when P19 muscle cells were treated with docetaxel for
12 hr, the myostatin mRNA or its protein expression
increased, whereas IL-6 or TNF-α was the same (Figure
4D). Added together, the docetaxel-induced muscle
atrophy is likely following the ubiquitin-proteasome and
lysosomal pathways through the myostatin-mediated
FoxO1-dependent mechanism; the resulting IL-6 then upregulates atrophy-related genes (Figure 5E).

Combination of fish oil and selenium attenuates
chemotherapeutic induced muscle proteolysis
through inhibiting FoxO-1 signaling

IL-6 affects skeletal muscle proteolysis in
chemotherapy

Recent clinical studies revealed that skeletal muscle
depletion is related to reduction of plasma n-3 fatty acids
in NSCLC patients [21]. For example, Fearon et al. [35]
reported that there is a positive correlation between plasma
EPA and lean body mass in advanced cancer patients
receiving fish oil supplementation. Similarly, our study
suggested that tumor-bearing mice supplemented with a
combination of fish oil and selenium yeast significantly
increased their body weights [18]. Since few therapeutic
options are available to cope with cancer cachexia,
nutritional supplementation appears to be a promising
measure to sustain muscle masses against cancer cachexia.
As shown in Figure 5A, the weights of soleus and
gastrocnemius muscles lose significantly in tumor-bearing
mice under chemotherapy. This situation was reversed
by supplementing mice with nutrients (TD-fo+se). One
should note that background diet slightly improved muscle
atrophy, likely because the diet contained some essential
nutrients, for example, branched chain amino-acid
(BCAA) leucine [36]. Since the level of phospholipids
(PLs) is a metabolic index of endogenous or dietary
fatty acids [37], the level of plasma PLs was therefore
determined to estimate n-3 fatty acids in the blood of
mice. As shown in Figure 5C, the PLs level in tumorbearing mice under chemotherapy (TD) is lower than that
of normal mice [26]. In contrast, the level of PLs in mice
supplemented with fish oil and selenium yeast is higher.
Growing evidence suggests that the tumor

Agreeing with our previous report, the skeletal
muscle wasting of mice in chemotherapy brought about
immediately after the onset of cachexia (Table 1B).
The effects of docetaxel on skeletal muscle proteolysis
in healthy mice were examined as a contrast. Western
blotting analysis for the gastrocnemius muscles of normal
adult mice receiving a high dose of docetaxel revealed that
the levels of both IL-6 and myostatin increased 3 folds
relative to that of TNF-α (Figure 4A). To know whether
docetaxel affects normal BHK-21 or specific muscle P19
cells, cytotoxicity was examined by MTS assay. Cells
were cultured in the presence of 0, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320
μg/ml docetaxel for 48 hr and then subjected to the assay.
The result showed that docetaxel inhibited proliferation of
line-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). The
inhibitory level of docetaxel for BHK-21 cells was lower
than that for line-1 cells. Namely, docetaxel at a dose of
40 μg/ml can kill 50% of line-1 cells but kill only 10%
of BHK-21 or P19 cells (Figure 4C). Interestingly, the
P19 skeletal muscle cells can restore its population when
exposed to the low dose of docetaxel (Figure 4C). We
further performed a time-course assay, where the growth
of P19 cells increased 20% in the presence of 20 μg/ml
docetaxel (Figure 4C right). The docetaxel-treated mice
however showed lethal wasting syndrome, a progressive
muscle/weight loss (Table 1B).

inflammatory responses are positively correlated to
progression of cachexia. Key inflammatory factors IL1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in serum were thus determined. The
IL-6 level significantly increased in tumor-bearing mice
after chemotherapy (Table 2C), suggesting that both
chemotherapeutic agent-induced IL-6 and myostatin
promote muscle atrophy. We further examined the
proliferation rate of P19 muscle cells treated with sera
from different groups of mice, where the viability of
the cells treated with serum from mice receiving no
supplementation significantly decreased (Figure 5B). In
contract, the viability of the cells treated with the serum
of TD-fo+se or TD mice increased to 78% or 40% (Figure
5B), underlining the effect of fish oil and selenium.
To probe which mediators are involved in the
regulation of the chemotherapeutics or nutritional
supplementation-mediated proteolysis, the expression of
proteolytic-related proteins in gastrocnemius muscles of
cachectic mice was examined. As shown in Figure 5D,
myostatin and IL-6 significantly increase in the docetaxeltreated mice (TD), as opposed to that in tumor-bearing
mice (T). The myostatin-mediated FoxO-1 was also
up-regulated after chemotherapy (Figure 5D right). Our
results suggest that both docetaxel-elicited myostatin
and IL-6 up-regulate FoxO-1 signaling pathway, thus
facilitating muscle degradation. Administration of fish
oil and selenium inhibits expression of cytokines and
myostatin in cachectic mice, thus down-regulating the
proteolytic signaling pathway (Figure 5E).

gluconeogenesis from amino acids in liver.
The docetaxel treatment deteriorated muscle wasting
in tumor mice (Table 1C), suggesting that the agent plays a
dual role for muscle atrophy and tumor shrinking (Figure
2). Gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog, is used to reduce the
number of pro-inflammatory MDSC thus improving antitumor responses [38]. Docetaxel significantly reduced the
number of MDSC and Tregs in spleen of tumor-bearing
mice, while the numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells
and NK cells were not changed (Figure 2A). Since TNF-α
promotes expansion and function of Tregs through TNF
receptor type II (TNFRII) [39], the reduction of Tregs
may be ascribed to the decrease of TNF-α upon docetaxel
administration. Inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6
are two key mediators in skeletal muscle homeostasis [40].
In this study the circulating level of IL-6 was constant
from one group to another, suggesting that TNF-α is more
critical than IL-6 in tumor-induced muscle wasting (Table
2A).
Protein degradation is regulated by three major
proteolytic pathways, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway,
calcium-activated system and lysosomal pathway.
Recent studies suggested that TNF-α-dependent NF-κB
initiates both the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [41]
and the calcium-activated system in protein degradation
[42]. Myostatin, a member of the TGF-β superfamily
of secreted growth factors, negatively regulates skeletal
muscles (Figure 3) [43]. The fact is that myostatin downregulates the expression of myogenic genes MyoD
and pax3, in contrast to the ubiquitin- and lysosomalassociated genes that are up-regulated [44]. Myostatin also
inhibits phosphorylation of Akt, thus increasing FoxO-1
but not NF-κB [31]. As a result, TNF-α and myostatin
together up-regulate both ubiquitin-proteasome and
calpain systems for disassembly/degradation of muscle
myofilaments (Figure 5E).
In this study healthy mice injected with docetaxel
showed acute skeletal muscle wasting and elevation of
IL-6 in serum and muscle, suggesting that IL-6 is the key
factor in the induction of cachexia (Table 2B). The level of
myostatin increased earlier than that of IL-6 in P19 muscle
cells treated with docetaxel (Figure 4D), suggesting
that myostatin interacts with circulating inflammatory
cytokines. This result agrees with the study where C2C12
myotubules treated with myostatin significantly increased
IL-6 mRNA in muscle cells [45], while it disagrees
with some published results that favor the proteasomedependent muscle proteolysis [26, 46]. In general, skeletal
muscle atrophy results from overexpression of TNF-α
and myostatin, which up-regulates calcium-activated and
ubiquitin-proteasome systems in tumor mice. In contrast,
docetaxel increases myostatin to activate FoxO-1, thus
leading to more serious protein degradation.
Our result demonstrated that the muscle in the line1 tumor-bearing mice treated with docetaxel underwent
atrophy 1.5 folds severer than that treated with tumor cells

DISCUSSION
Cachexia, a debilitating syndrome, occurs in
many cancers, while the causation remain poorly
understood. Cachexia is generally associated with
systemic inflammation, enhanced proteolysis, and
hypoalbuminemia. Identifying committed biomarkers may
provide a solution to cope with cancer cachexia. It is also
known that antineoplastic therapies such as chemotherapy
influences systemic inflammation and wasting, the
mechanism of which is again less elucidated.
In this study tumors that cause significant decline
of mice body weight and serum albumin may account
for the fact that human cancer wreaks havoc on man
(Figure 1, Table 2). Cancer cachectic mice showed
losses of muscle and fat; the latter was more seriously
affected at the early onset of the disease (Table 1A). The
body composition in chemotherapeutic agent-induced
cachexia differed from that receiving no therapy, namely,
muscle loss is quicker than fat loss in the former (Table
1B), while the trend reverses in the later. The mice with
tumor-induced cachexia may experience more severe loss
of skeletal muscles; mice receiving a higher dose of the
chemotherapeutic agent likely developed anorexia. So,
the energy utilization in brain may switch from glucose
to fat-derived ketone bodies thereby slowing down

alone (Table 1C), indicating that the chemotherapeutic
agent causes muscle atrophy and tumor shrinking. One
should note that the muscle mass increased but the
expression of proteolytic-related proteins had no change
in the TD-base group. Our results suggest that BCAAs
(leucine in particular) play a role in the regulation of
skeletal muscle protein metabolism [47]. The background
diet that contains BCAAs (isoleucine, leucine and valine)
probably has no role on proteolysis, but instead it may
stimulate protein synthesis.
Growing evidence has shown that the cancerprovoked inflammatory responses promote serious
cachexia. Imbalanced catabolism/anabolism is evident
not able to maintain lean body mass even under normal
food intake [48]. Clinical data further [49] suggested
that n-3 fish oil can reduce both catabolism and body
weight loss in cancer patients. The increased survival
rate for advanced cancer patients supplemented with n-3
fatty acids was ascribed to reduction of inflammatory
responses [50]. On the other hand, Vieira et al. (2015)
reported that supplementation with selenium can reduce
chemotherapeutic side effects for cancer patients [17].
It has been suggested that selenium is a modulator in
circadian clocks, that protects mice from toxicity of a
given chemotherapeutic drug [51].
In previous study we demonstrated that dietary
supplementation with fish oil and selenium synergistically
reduced immunosuppressive cells in tumor-bearing mice
[18]. The additive effect of these two nutrients is best
illustrated by the change of skeletal muscle masses shown
in Figure 5. This additive effect can be explained by two
facts: [1] anabolic stimulation by essential amino acids, [2]
reduction of protein catabolism by reduced inflammatory
(fish oil and selenium) and down-regulation of proteolysis
signaling pathway. With supplementation of both fish
oil and selenium the skeletal muscle atrophy improved
significantly is likely due to down-regulation of myostatin
as well as related cytokines. Fish oil may balance body
compositions in cachectic patients particularly by reducing
inflammatory responses. Our result echoes a recent
study, where eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) eased adverse
effects of TNF-α on C2C12 myogenesis [52]. Similarly,
supplementation with EPA and DHA for advanced cancer
was able to lessen lean tissue wasting [35]. Moreover,
our results showed that reduction of both TNF-α and
myostatin only occurred in the TD-fo+se group but not in
the TD-base group. The reduction of myostatin in muscle
is likely through inhibiting humoral mediator(s) secreted
by the implanted tumor cells or host cells in response to
chemotherapy. As a result, fish oil and selenium yeast
can antagonize loss of skeletal muscle proteins in cancer
cachexia by down-regulating proteolytic genes expression;
this may also be the mechanism whereby tumor growth is
inhibited. As to how individual fish oil or selenium takes
part in the proteolytic protection, the effect requires further
examination.

Elevation of serum IL-6 and IL-1β in tumor-bearing
mice after docetaxel treatment implicates that docetaxel
gives rise to side effects. To know that this is not specific
to docetaxel, we also examined 5-FU and cisplatin,
which reduced not only the tumor burden but also the
body weight. Although protein synthesis was affected,
skeletal muscle protein degradation is likely the major
cause for cachexia [53]. In addition to the reduction of
immunosuppressive cells [18], the combination of fish oil
and selenium can restore the muscle mass by inhibiting the
proteolytic pathway.
In summary, specific immunocompetent lung cancer
mice models established in this study demonstrated that
cancer cachexia is closely related to chemotherapy. The
anti-cancer drug docetaxel modulated immune responses
in suppression of Tregs and MDSC, thus aggravating
muscle wasting. The model system developed here is
suitable to serve as a research platform, for example, for
probing muscle atrophy mechanisms/lung cancer immune
regulation as well as evaluating therapeutic efficacy for
new drug candidates. Importantly, the combination of the
selected nutrients (fish oils and selenium yeast) not only
attenuates muscle protein degradation but also stimulates
protein synthesis in chemotherapy. Despite requiring
further clinical evaluation, this supplement regimen in
conjunction with conventional cancer therapy bodes well
for future cancer therapy.

METHODS
Cells and cell culture
Line-1 cells from a BALB/cByJ alveolar lung
carcinoma (provided from Dr. John Yuhas) were adapted
to tissue culture [54]. Line-1 and baby hamster kidney-21
cells (BHK-21, ATCC CCL10) were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 5% and 10% fetal bovine
serum, respectively. Lewis lung cancer cells (LLC, CRL1642) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium. Mouse embryonic teratocarcinoma cells (P19;
ATCC CRL-1825) were differentiated in the presence
of 0.5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to form cardiac and
skeletal muscle-like elements [55]. Undifferentiated cells
were propagated in DMEM (GIBCO-BRL Burlington,
ON, Canada) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS, and the antibiotics (GIBCO/BRL) penicillin G (50
units/ml) and streptomycin (50 cg/ml). The cultures were
maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2
and passaged every 2 days. Differentiation was routinely
induced with DMSO. Briefly, 2.5x106 cells were allowed
to aggregate for 4 days in nonadhesive bacteriological
grade Petri dishes (6 cm diameter) containing 5 ml
of complete medium, in the presence of 0.5% DMSO
(Sigma). Cardiac muscle first appears on Day 6 of

tumor combine chemotherapeutic model (Figures S1,
protocol #3), after tumor implantation, the mice were
treated with docetaxel (20 mg/kg) or cisplatin (5 mg/kg)
every four days, or 5-FU (40 mg/kg) to approach clinical
observation. Following inoculation of tumor cells or drug,
body mass, food intake and tumor size were measured
four times a week. Tumor growth was assessed by the
measurement of two bisecting diameters in each tumor
using calipers. The size of the tumor was determined by
direct measurement of the tumor dimensions.

P19 cell treatments and extract preparation
P19 cells were cultured as described in 4.2.1. After
9 days incubation with 0.5% DMSO, cells were cultured
with DMEM (contain 0.5% DMSO) in the presence or
absence of 80 μg/ml docetaxel. After 12, 18 or 24 hr,
medium was removed and collected into eppendorf. Cells
and then washed in PBS and lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EGTA, 25 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40,
10 mM NaF, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM orthovanadate,
100 nM okadaic acid, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 mM AEBSF)
was then added to the cells, and the lysate was centrifuged
at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. All samples were stroed at -80oC
until further analysis.

Experimental diets
The mice in the dietary supplementation experiment
were daily supplemented with 63 mg fats (100% soy
oil), 514 mg carbohydrates and 194 mg proteins as a
background diet (Ethan Nutraceutical Company Ltd.,
USA). The experimental diets included additional 20 mg
fish oil (contained 11 mg EPA and DHA) and/or 0.69 μg
selenium yeast. Fish oil and selenium yeast were obtained
from Ethan Nutraceutical Company Ltd. (USA).

Cytotoxicy assay
Cell viability was monitored by using the CellTiter
96 Aqueous One Solution Assay and performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega Corporation,
USA). In brief, LLC, Line 1, BHK-21 and P19 cells at a
desity of 0.5x104 in 80 μl/well were incubated in a 96-well
plate at 37oC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 24
hours cells were then treated with different concentration
of docetaxel (320, 160, 80, 40, 20 μg/ml) for 48 hours.
On the other hand, P19 cells were incubated in DMEM in
the presence of 10% serum from mice for 24 hours. After
that MTS solution was added (20 μl/well) and cells were
incubated for 2 hours under the same conditions. At the
end of incubation, the absorbance at 490 nm was measured
using a BIOTEK μQuant microplate reader (BIO-TEK
instrument, Winooski, VT).

Levels of serum albumin,
phospholipids levels

and

The levels of serum albumin were measured for
experimental mice using the SPOTCHEM EZ SP-4430
dry chemical system (Arkray, Kyoto). Cytokines in serum
were measured using the OptEIATM ELISA Set (BD,
Canada, USA) for mouse TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. Optical
density was recorded using a μQuant spectrophotometer
(Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, USA). Plasma
phospholipids [16] levels were measured in experimental
mice by using a SPOTCHEM EZ SP-4430 dry chemical
system (Arkray, Kyoto).

Animals, tumor implantation, and chemotherapy

Splenocyte isolation and flow-cytometric analysis

Male BALB/cByJ or C57BL/6 mice (6-7 weeks)
were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal
Center. Mice were individually housed in a climate
controlled room (12:12 dark-light cycle with a constant
room temperature of 21±1oC). Mice were given at least
4 days to adjust to their new environment and diet
before treatments were imposed. Mice were given free
access to water and food (laboratory rodent diet, labdiet
5001, USA). After acclimatization mice were divided
into weight-matched groups. In the first tumor model
(Figures S1, protocol #1), mice were inoculated s.c. with
a homogenate of tumor cells (1x105) on day 0. The control
group was injected with 0.1 ml of sterile saline solution. In
the second chemotherapeutic model (Figures S1, protocol
#2), animals received two or four times i.p. injection of
either docetaxel (taxotere®, 20 mg/kg body weight) or
saline every day to create an acute response. The third

cytokines

Splenocytes were isolated by centrifugation (300
g); red blood cells were lysed using the Gey’s reagent
(0.829 g NH4Cl, 0.1 g HCO3 and 3.72 mg Na2EDTA
in 100 ml ddH2O). For determining phenotypes of
splenocytes isolated from spleens, cells were stained
with an appropriate combination of anti-CD3ε (100306;
Biolegend), anti-CD4 (100516; Biolegend), anti-CD8a
(100714; Biolegend), anti-CD19 (115508; Biolegend),
anti-Gr-1 (108416; Biolegend), anti-Ly6G (127613;
Biolegend) or anti-CD11b (101212; Biolegend) after
blocking of the Fc receptor with anti-CD32/CD16 (BD
Biosciences) at 4oC. For T regulatory cells staining, cells
were incubated with anti-CD4 and anti-CD25 (102006;
Biolegend) for 30 minutes, followed by fixing in 2%
paraformaldehyde, permeabilizing with Perm/Wash buffer
(BD Biosciences), and staining with anti-Fox-p3 (320008;
7769

Biolegend). For determining NK cytotoxicity, cells were
isolated from mouse spleens (regard as effector cells).
The target cells (line-1) were stained with DIOC18 (10 µl
per 1×106 cells) for 20 min at 37°C. The cells then were
washed twice with a buffer solution and then resuspended
in a complete culture media at a concentration of 1×106
cells/ml. The target and effector cells (splenocytes) were
prepared by making co-cultured cells in ratios of E:T= 5:1,
20:1, and 40:1. These co-cultures were incubated for 4
hours, and centrifuged at 250 g for 5 min through alternate
washes and suspensions; supernatants were discarded. The
cells then were labeled with propidium iodide (PI, 2 µl/per
test) and incubated at room temperature in dark. Analysis
was performed using FACScan (BD Biosciences). For
characterization of cell types, a large gate was set to
include monocytes and lymphocytes for forward scatter
vs. side scatter.

probed with a specific antibody against β-actin (1:5000,
Novus Biologicals). The intensity was quantified using the
Fotodyne Image analysis System (Fotodyne, Hartland, WI,
USA) and the TotalLab software (Nonlinear Dynamics,
Durham, NC, USA).

Immunofluorescence assay
Paraffin sections were blocked by a blocking buffer
for 1 hour at room temperature and stained with a specific
primary antibody at a dilution of 1:200 for 24 hours. The
primary antibody was washed using PBS. The sections
then were stained with a specific secondary antibody at
a dilution of 1:100 for 24 hours at room temperature and
washed with PBS. The primary antibodies used here are
listed as follows: rabbit anti-mouse NF-κB (Novus, USA),
rabbit anti-mouse MuRF-1 (Santa Cruz, USA) and FITCconjugates rabbit anti-mouse MAFbx (ECM biosciences,
USA). The secondary antibody was the FITC-conjugates
goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, USA).

RNA extraction and RT-qPCR
Total tumor RNA was extracted with a commercially
available RNA mini kit (Qiagen); cDNA was synthesized
using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and the
oligo-dT15-primer (Promega). Real-time qPCR primers
were designed using the Primer3 webware; electrophoresis
was performed to verify DNA products. Reactions were
run on the Bio-Rad iCycler iQ system in the presence
of the Sybr-Green PCR mix (iCycler iQ Real Time PCR
Detection System, Bio-Rad). The comparative threshold
cycle [54] method was used to calculate the relative
expressions [56]. For quantification of gene expressions,
the values of target genes were normalized by the value
of the endogenous reference GAPDH. The quantity
of the target gene relative to a calibrator (normal pool
expression) is given by: 2-ΔΔCT [ΔCT = CT(target gene) CT(GAPDH); ΔΔCT = CT for any sample - ΔCT for the
calibrator].

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as means ± SD. Statistical
significance was determined by one-way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (Prism
Graph Pad). Differences were considered statistically
significant when P<0.05.

buffer solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM ATP, 5
mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 5 μL of a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)). Proteins (20 μg/
lane) were separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel
(a precast SDS gel (Bio-Rad)) and then transferred to
a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon,
Millipore). Proteins were determined using antibodies
