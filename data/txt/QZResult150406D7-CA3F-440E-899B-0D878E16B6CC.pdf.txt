ABSTRACT
Specific niches within the tumor bone marrow (BM) microenvironment afford a
sanctuary for multiple myeloma (MM) clones due to stromal cell-tumor cell interactions,
which confer survival advantage and drug resistance. Defining the sequelae of tumor
cell interactions within the MM niches on an individualized basis may provide the
rationale for personalized therapies. To mimic the MM niche, we here describe a new
3D co-culture ex-vivo model in which primary MM patient BM cells are co-cultured with
mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in a hydrogel 3D system. In the 3D model, MSC with
conserved phenotype (CD73+CD90+CD105+) formed compact clusters with active
fibrous connections, and retained lineage differentiation capacity. Extracellular matrix
molecules, integrins, and niche related molecules including N-cadherin and CXCL12 are
expressed in 3D MSC model. Furthermore, activation of osteogenesis (MMP13, SPP1,
ADAMTS4, and MGP genes) and osteoblastogenic differentiation was confirmed in 3D
MSC model. Co-culture of patient-derived BM mononuclear cells with either autologous
or allogeneic MSC in 3D model increased proliferation of MM cells, CXCR4 expression,
and SP cells. We carried out immune profiling to show that distribution of immune
cell subsets was similar in 3D and 2D MSC model systems. Importantly, resistance to
novel agents (IMiDs, bortezomib, carfilzomib) and conventional agents (doxorubicin,
dexamethasone, melphalan) was observed in 3D MSC system, reflective of clinical
resistance. This 3D MSC model may therefore allow for studies of MM pathogenesis
and drug resistance within the BM niche. Importantly, ongoing prospective trials are
evaluating its utility to inform personalized targeted and immune therapy in MM.

addition to genetic anomalies intrinsic to MM clones,
malignant PCs are also influenced by their tumor
microenvironment [2]. In particular, fibroblast/stromal-

like cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, and the extracellular matrix profoundly contribute the behavior of MM
cells. Indeed the bidirectional interaction between MM
cells and their supporting stromal cells plays a central
role in myelomagenesis, mediating resistance to cell
death, sustained proliferation, cell homing and invasion,
immunosuppression, stemness and self-renewal, as well
as angiogenesis, thereby promoting MM progression [3,
4]. Characterizing the efficacy of novel agents therefore
should not only assess impact on myeloma cells, but also
define effects on the tumor microenvironment.
Specific niches within the tumor microenvironment
afford a sanctuary for MM clones due to stromal cell-tumor
cell interactions, which confer a survival advantage and
drug resistance [4, 5]. Similarities in regulatory signaling
molecules and the cell-cell crosstalk interactions between
the normal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche and the
myeloma niche have been reported [6, 7]. Key common
signaling pathways and molecules in both niches include:
CXCL12/CXCR4 axis mediating homing and maintenance
of HSC/MM cells; IL-6 signaling mediating growth and
survival of HSC/MM cells; as well as VCAM1/VLA4 axis for retention of HSC/MM cells [8–10]. Further
defining phenotypic features and molecular signatures
of tumor cells in the myeloma niche will provide the
framework for development of new treatment strategies
targeting the sequelae of MM interactions with the BM
milieu.
Several preclinical studies have demonstrated
promise of novel anti-MM agents, which has not translated
to clinical benefit. This may be due to unfavorable
drug pharmacokinetics, but may reflect limitations in
drug testing without the tumor microenvironment and/
or lack of 3 dimensional (3D) BM architecture [11,
12]. The importance of using in vitro 3D, rather than
2-dimentional (2D), models to create an experimental
system recapitulating the specialized properties of the MM
BM has been demonstrated using: ECM molecules such
as collagen and/or fibronectin [13]; specialized scaffolds
including gelatin sponges [14] or silk [15]; microfluidic
ossified tissues such as osteoblast or plasma [16, 17], as
well as RCCS™ bioreactor-based cultures [18]. However,
additional studies are needed to closely mimic and
investigate the myeloma niche.
Here we introduce a new 3D co-culture ex-vivo
model to mimic the myeloma niche composed of nonhematopoietic MM-associated mesenchymal stem
cells, also known as multipotent stromal cells (MSC),
imbedded in a hydrogel 3D system and co-cultured with
primary MM patient cells. This model allows for study
of cellular components in the myeloma niche including
hematopoietic, immune, and tumor cells. In this study, we
investigated the role of the tumor microenvironment in the
pathogenesis of MM and drug resistance using this 3D coculture system of MSC with patient BM cells and MM
cells. We demonstrated that this 3D co-culture ex-vivo

system is useful for (i) study of the myeloma biology,
especially mechanisms of drug resistance; (ii) evaluation
of immune cell subset suppression; (iii) definition
of efficacy of anti-MM/experimental drugs; and (iv)
evaluation of treatment efficacy against individual patient
MM cells to facilitate personalized targeted therapy.

RESULTS
Generation of 3D MSC model
To study mesenchymal stem cells/multipotent
stromal cells (MSC) at different stages of MM (Figure 1A,
ii), we used a multicolor flow cytometry panel to identify
cells lacking human lineage markers (CD2, CD3,
CD14, CD16, CD19, CD56, CD235a), CD45, CD34
and HLA-DR, but expressing CD73, CD90 and CD105.
The percentage of MSCs population was compared in
smoldering MM (SMM), newly diagnosed MM (ND),
relapsed (REL), and relapsed/refractory (REF) MM
(Figure 1B). Interestingly, the MSC population increased
in relapsed and relapsed/refractory MM patient samples.
To mimic the neoplastic BM microenvironment of MM,
we established a novel model of the marrow niche by
culturing MM patient-derived MSC ex-vivo in a hydrogelbased 3D model (3D MSC) compared with conventional
monolayer culture (2D MSC; Figure 1C). In the 3D
model, MSC formed compact clusters with active fibrous
connections at day 3 to 5 (Figure 1D).

3D MSC conserve MSC-specific phenotype and
undergo lineage differentiation capacity
MSC are known for the specific phenotype by
co-expression of CD73, CD90, and CD105 [19]. MM
patient-derived MSC clusters in 3D models highly
expressed CD73, CD90, and CD105, as did MSC in 2D
model (Figure 2A). Of note, MSC in 3D models revealed
significantly decreased expression of CD271 and CD146
than in 2D models (Figure 2B), whereas expression of
HLA-ABC and CD166 was similar, only with minimal
increases in mean fluorescence intensity in 3D vs 2D
models. To assess the differentiation potential of these
models, we cultured MSC in 3D versus 2D models with
differentiation media towards osteogenic and adipogenic
lineages. After culture in adipogenic differentiation media
for 14 days, MSC in both 3D and 2D cultures efficiently
differentiated into the adipogenic lineage, evidenced
by Oil Red staining of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm
(Figure 2C). Similarly, MSC grown in 2D versus 3D
models with osteoblastogenic media for 21 days formed
osteoblasts with extensive calcium mineralized matrix,
evidenced by Alizarin red staining (Figure 2D). Moreover,
low levels of calcium mineralization of clusters were
observed in 3D model, even without osteoblastogenic
media. We also assessed production of osteopontin (OPN)

and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) using multiplex luminex
technology. OPN and Ang-2 production was significantly
higher in 3D versus 2D MSC models (Figure 2E).

vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was observed
in 3D versus 2D MSC models (Figure 3A).

3D MSC increase neoplastic BM
microenvironment

3D MSC express ECM- and integrin-rich
microenvironment

Previous studies suggest that MSCs modulate
the MM BM microenvironment by modifying cytokine
production [2]. We hypothesized that cytokine
secretion by 3D MSC would enhance their ability to
support MM cell growth. We measured production of
cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors implicated
in MM pathogenesis using multiple luminex analysis.
Significantly higher production of interleukin 6 (IL-6),
interleukin 8 (IL-8), monocyte chemotactic and activating
factor (MCP-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein

Because the stem cell niche is enriched with
extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules promoting
expansion of the stem cell pool, we next studied
ECM expression in these models. Significantly higher
expression of ECM molecules including fibronectin,
laminin, vitronectin, collagen IV, and collagen I was
evident in 3D versus 2D MSC models, as determined by
confocal microscopy analysis (Figure 3B, left). Similarly,
in 5 day cultures of MM patient-derived MSC, we
observed statistically significantly higher levels of ECM

molecules in 3D versus 2D models, as determined by flow
cytometry analysis (Figure 3B, right). Consistent with
the expression of various ECM molecules, expression of
β1 and α4 subunits of VLA-4 integrin were also higher
in 3D compared to 2D MSC cultures, as determined by
immunofluorescence staining of confocal microscopy and
confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (Supplementary

Figure S1). Furthermore, formation of dimeric active
integrins including α5β1 (VLA-5), α2β1 (VLA-2), and
αvβ3 (VLA-3) on the MSC surface when engaged by
these ECM molecules, which induces MM proliferation
and survival, was also increased in the 3D versus 2D MSC
model, as confirmed by confocal microscopy and flow
cytometry analysis (Figure 3C).

3D MSC form functional myeloma niche

for 7 days in 2D versus 3D models. MNC were either
thawed (autologous model; Figure 5A) or freshly isolated
(allogeneic model; Figure 5B), evaluated for plasma
cells (PC) expression before co-culture (black column),
and then seeded either into hydrogel based 3D (red) or
monolayer 2D (grey) models in which MSC had been
maintained for 5 days in culture. In autologous MNC cocultures with MSC, we noted increased proliferation of
PC in 7 of 12 MM patients in both 3D and 2D models,
with slightly higher proliferation rate in the 3D MSC
model (Figure 5A). Moreover, MSC in 3D versus 2D
conditions co-culture with allogeneic MNC from MM
patients (N=12) similarly showed significant increase
of PC in 3D versus 2D models in 9 of 12 MM patients
(Figure 5B). Further phenotypic characterization of these
cells showed that CXCR4 expression was significantly
increased on PC co-cultured in 3D versus 2D MSC models
(Figure 5C). Furthermore, expression of side population
(SP) cells representing “stem-like” features of MM cells
[20] was determined by Hoechst 33342 staining and
gating on CFSE positive MM cells in co-cultures with
MM patient-derived MSC; low Hoechst stained cells
were identified as SP cells (Figure 5D). The SP fraction
of MM cell lines (OPM1, KMS11 and OCIMY5) was
significantly increased in 3D versus 2D MCS co-culture
models at 3 days. We also co-cultured MSC in 3D versus
2D models with allogeneic MNC from MM patients
(N=5) to assess immune subpopulation distribution
using mass cytometry and spanning-tree progression
analysis of density-normalized events (SPADE) (Figure
6). No significant differences in immune cell frequencies
were detected between 2D versus 3D models; however,
decreased T cells and mature granulocytes were detected
in 3D versus 2D models (Supplementary Figure S3A). Of
note, median expression of immunophenotypic markers on
T cells, NK cells (Supplementary Figure S3B); mature B
cells, PC (Supplementary Figure S3C); monocyte and their
precursors, mDC, granulocytes as well as their precursor
(Supplementary Figure S3D); and MSC (Supplementary
Figure S3E) significantly differs in 3D versus 2D models.
Further evaluation of T cells including TH (helper) and
TC (cytotoxic) cell populations as well as both naïve
and memory T cells by SPADE analyses revealed that
no significant differences in cell frequencies were
detected in these models (Supplementary Figure S4A);
however, changes in median expression of T cell specific
markers were observed between 2D versus 3D models
(Supplementary Figure S4B). The similar distribution
pattern of immune cell subsets in both models suggests
that they may be useful to assess immune profile before
and after novel targeted and immune therapies.

To mimic the functional myeloma niche, key
hematopoietic and/or neoplastic niche molecules including
N-cadherin and nestin, as well as the interactions of MM
cells with MSCs in the niche via CXCL12/CXCR4 axis,
were next investigated. MM patient-derived MSC cultured
in 3D versus 2D models showed significantly increased
expression of N-cadherin and CXCL12, as detected by
flow cytometry analysis. In contrast, expression of nestin
was significantly decreased in 3D versus 2D MSC models
(Figure 3D). Moreover, levels of both soluble Tie-2
receptor (sTie-2) and stem cell factor (SCF), functionally
implicated in the HSC niche, were higher in 3D compared
to 2D MSC cultures. Similarly, higher levels of human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (sHER2neu) and
soluble epidermal growth factor receptor (sEGFR) were
evident after 5 days in 3D versus 2D MSC cultures,
assessed using multiplex luminex based technology
(Supplementary Figure S2).

3D MSC up-regulate bone-formatting genes/
form osteogenesis
We next compared differences in gene expression
analysis in 3D versus 2D MSC models. Unsupervised
analyses of gene expression profiles of SMM (N=5)
and ND MM (N=4) showed significant differences in
3D versus 2D models, evidenced by two major distinct
clusters in heat map (Figure 4A). Several major signaling
pathways implicated in cancer, cell cycle- regulation,
and adhesion were upregulated in 2D compared to
3D MSC models (Figure 4B). The most significantly
upregulated genes in 3D versus 2D MSC were in the
signaling pathway mediating endochondral ossification
(Figure 4C). The highest upregulation was detected
in matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), followed by
bone sialoprotein (SPP1), matrix gla protein (MGP),
and ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type
1motif 4 (ADAMTS4), as well as slightly increased
expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2)
and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) genes;
in contrast, calmodulin 1 (CALM1) was significantly
down-regulated. Furthermore, real-time RT-PCR analyses
comparing MM patient (SMM, ND, REL, REF; N=23)derived MSC cultured in 3D versus 2D models confirmed
significantly upregulated MMP13, SPP1, ADAMTS4,
and MGP with a slight increase of RUNX2 and FGFR1
expression; in contrast, expression of CALM1 was
significantly decreased (Figure 4D), consistent with
activation of osteogenesis in the 3D MSC model.

dye-labelled patient PC were added with novel and
conventional anti-MM drugs for 3 days. PC co-cultured
with 3D versus 2D MSC did not reveal any significant
differences after pomalidomide (POM) treatment;
however, PC in 3D co-cultures were significantly more
resistant to lenalidomide (LEN) and thalidomide (THAL)
than in 2D MSC model (Figure 7A). Similarly, resistance
to proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) was shown
in 3D versus 2D MSC model. In contrast to bortezomib,
treatment with carfilzomib (CFZ) showed high percentage
of apoptotic and necrotic PC in both 2D and 3D co-culture
systems (Figure 7B). Resistance to doxorubicin (DOXO)

and dexamethasone (DEX) was also observed in both coculture systems, and resistance to melphalan (MELPH)
treatment was observed in the 3D vs 2D model systems
(Figure 7C). Similarly, freshly isolated MNC from BM of
MM patients (N=4) were cultured with allogeneic MSC
in 3D versus 2D conditions, followed by treatment with
POM or CFZ for 7 days (Figure 7D). Resistance to POM
or CFZ was observed in 3D versus 2D models in MM
patients 2 or 4 and 1, respectively. While these data reflect
clinical resistance to these agents, ongoing prospective
trials are validating their predictive value to conventional,
novel and immune therapies in larger patient numbers.

DISCUSSION

(MSCs) embedded in an extracellular matrix make up the
unique neoplastic BM milieu that promotes the disease
development and progression. Therefore, the tumor
microenvironment is recognized both as an essential
factor in MM biology and target for novel therapeutic
strategies [23].
Several novel experimental drugs have not been
translated to the clinic due to preclinical drug evaluation
involving only tumor cells without consideration of the
role of the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, several
groups have developed stromal cell-MM cell co-culture
models as tools for novel drug screening [11, 12].
However, these models lacked the 3D architecture of the
BM, and therefore fail to mimic the in vivo niche. More
recent studies have elucidated the importance of using

In the BM, specialized microdomains termed
“niches” regulate hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)
function [21]. These specific HSC niches play essential
roles in controlling the balance in hematopoiesis
through heterologous cell-cell interactions, secreted
factors, extracellular matrix molecules (ECM), physical
parameters, as well as immunological and metabolic
control. Increasing evidence suggests that, like stem
cells, tumor cells do not depend solely on cell-intrinsic
events, but instead rely heavily on the microenvironment
or “niche” to maintain their growth, survival, and drug
resistance [22]. In MM, interactions between malignant
plasma cells and stromal/mesenchymal stem cells

3D, rather than 2D, models to create an experimental
system recapitulating the specialized properties of the
marrow microenvironment [24]. Specifically, 3D cultures
using ECM molecules [13], hyaluronic acid [25], and
specialized scaffolds like gelatin sponge [14] or silk [15]
have been introduced in vitro; however, these models lack
mineralization and do not mimic the strength, rigidity, or
complexity of in vivo. Other more sophisticated/advanced
approaches, such as microfluidic ossified tissue [16,
17] or RCCS™ bioreactor-based culture [18], remain
very technically challenging. Moreover, several murine
humanized MSC-MM cell interaction models have been
developed using the SCID-hu model [26, 27], or based
on scaffolds such as 3D poly-ε-caprolactone polymeric
scaffolds [28] or biphasic calcium phosphate [29];
however, these models are costly, time-consuming, and
exhibit drug distribution limitations. Therefore, more
studies are needed to develop models of the architecture
of BM, facilitating studies of MM pathophysiology and
novel drug development.
Several similarities between the normal HSC niche
and the MM niche have been described. To develop
an experimental system recapitulating the specialized
properties of the neoplastic BM microenvironment, we
therefore first expanded and modified the HSC niche
model [30]. Specifically, we first introduced new 3D
co-culture ex-vivo models composed of MM patientderived MSC in hydrogel 3D system for co-culture with
patient MM BM cells. In the field of tissue engineering,
creating hydrogel based 3D culture systems, a network
of interacting polymer chains that are highly hydrated
with elasticity similar to natural tissues, with MSCs can
achieve tissue-like structures in vitro. Importantly, MM
patient-derived MSC, which represent the main cellular
component of the marrow niche, in the hydrogel based
system promote a high degree of mineralization and
differentiation and create MM niche-like structures in
vitro. These patient-derived MSC supply the appropriate
niche scaffold for MM growth, survival, and homing.
Moreover, MSCs are clonogenic and can be expanded ex
vivo without any apparent modification in phenotype and
loss of function [31] and therefore represent a promising
strategy for tissue engineering, repair of damaged tissue,
and gene therapy.
Previous reports show that myeloma-associated
MSC demonstrate significant abnormalities compared
to healthy donors MSCs, including ECM, integrin and
cytokine modulation changes [32–34]. It has been reported
that there are 0.01-0.001% of MSCs in the healthy bone
marrow. Our data showed varied distribution of MSC
population (defined by co-expression of CD73, CD90
and CD105 and negative for all hematopoietic markers,
such as lineage markers as well as CD34 progenitors)
in differently treated MM patients (REL and REF MM
patients) compared to untreated MM patient samples in
premalignant (SMM) or newly diagnosed (ND) active
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MM stages. Interestingly, higher MSC population was
revealed in treated REL and REF MM samples (0.011.3%), suggesting an impact of anti-MM therapies on
the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, significantly
less (more than 15 times) amount of MSCs (≤1.3%) was
observed compared to plasma cells (≤20%, defined by
co-expression of CD38 and CD138; data not shown),
confirming the necessity for the MSC expansion to study
MM disease in their presence.
Three criteria to define MSCs have been
determined: adherence to plastic; expression of CD73,
CD90 and CD105; and differentiation into three-lineage
stages [19]. BM-derived stromal progenitors also have
been termed mesenchymal stem cells due to their specific
capability of generating multiple mesenchymal lineages
[31]. Our data showed that 3D MSC maintained their
multi-lineage differentiation potential toward adipocytes
and osteoblasts, as well as conserved phenotype defined
by co-expression of CD73, CD90 and CD105. Moreover,
3D MSC showed calcium mineralization of clusters
supporting differentiation towards the osteoblastogenic
lineage, which was functionally confirmed by increased
production of OPN and angiopoietin. OPN and
angiopoietins are regulators of osteoblast-mediated HSC/
MM cells maintenance, and are expressed by osteoblasts
[35]. Furthermore, our 3D MSC model showed increased
expression of N-cadherin as well as up-regulation of
bone-related genes including MMP13, supporting
early osteoblast differentiation. Similarly, activation of
osteogenesis in the 3D MSC model versus 2D monolayer
cultures is associated with significant overexpression
of endochondral ossification pathway genes including
SPP1, MGP and ADAMTS4. These results are consistent
with the observation that pre-osteoblast/early osteoblast
precursors increase proliferation of MM cells, in
contrast to mature osteoblasts which form mineralized
nodules and suppress the growth and proliferation of
MM cells [36–39]. Moreover, MSCs are negative for
hematopoietic markers CD45, CD34 and other lineage
differentiation markers [19]. We here confirmed that
the 3D MSC clusters lacked expression of CD45, CD34
and HLA-DR, as well as lineage differentiation markers
similar to 2D MSC (data not shown). Furthermore, they
display common expression profile markers including
CD29, CD49c, CD166 and HLA-ABC, which are
similarly detected in both our systems. Nevertheless,
significant differences have been shown in expression
of CD36, CD106, CD146 and others [40]. Similarly,
3D MSC lacked expression of CD146, which suggests
similarities with CD45-CD146-negative expression of
MSC located in the endothelial niche [41]. Moreover,
CD271 downregulated expression in 3D MSC suggests
MSC differentiation from CD271+ progenitors [42].
Therefore, our 3D MSC model mimics the BM niche,
allowing for further studies of MM biology and novel
therapeutic strategies.

Indirect communication between tumor cells
and MSCs is mediated by secretion of growth factors,
chemokines, and cytokines. IL-6 remains the prototypical
growth and survival factor in MM [43]. In addition to IL6, other cytokines and/or chemokines also contribute to
the cross-talk between stroma and MM cells including
IL-8, RANTES (regulated and normal T cell expressed
and secreted), IL-1β, TNF-α, IGF-1 (insulin-like growth
factor-1) and others [6]. VEGF also modulates growth,
survival and migration of myeloma cells in an autocrine
manner via VEGFR-1 [44]. Moreover, the tumor
microenvironment releases growth factors for myeloma
cells including HGF, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
fibroblast growth factor-2, MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic
protein-1), and others [45]. Our data showed that MSC
in the 3D model support production of pro-inflammatory
interleukins IL-6 and IL-8; MCP-1; IGFBP-1; as well as
pro-angiogenic growth factors VEGF and HGF involved
in progression of MM. Moreover, production of sHER2/
neu and sEGFR, growth factors of aggressive cancers,
was also assessed in 3D MSC. Our study suggests that
recruitment of MM cells and other normal hematopoietic
cells and non-hematopoietic cells and their progeny to the
MM niche leads to a complex milieu of growth factors,
chemokines, and ECM that can form a functional niche.
Therefore, deeper understanding the phenotypic features
and molecular signatures of the neoplastic BM niche in
MM may provide the framework for future development
of new treatment strategies targeting biology of both MM
cells and their BM niche.
Key signaling regulatory molecules and cell-cell
crosstalk interactions involved in MM are directly adopted
from the normal HSC niche. The most abundant acellular
component of the BM niche is composed of ECMs
including fibronectin, laminin, collagen, and hyaluronan.
Abnormal ECM or ECM stiffness deregulates the tumor
microenvironment by facilitating angiogenesis and
inflammation [46]. Moreover, ECMs mediate adhesion,
migration, and cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance of
MM cells by binding to adhesion molecules [47]. HSC/
MM cell adhesion is mediated via the integrin family
including very late antigen 4 (VLA-4, composed of α4
and β1 subunits) and VLA-5 (active dimer of α5 and β1
subunits) [48, 49]. Our 3D model showed upregulation
of ECM molecules and integrins (α2β1, α5β1, and αvβ3)
which are mediators of MM progression and resistance to
apoptosis. In addition, the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis signaling
pathway plays an important role in MM maintenance and
homing, with high expression of CXCL12 on stromal
cells acting as a chemoattractant for both HSC/MM
cells expressing high level of CXCR4 [50]. In our 3D
model, we observed significantly higher expression of
CXCL12 on myeloma derived-MSCs and upregulated
CXCR-4 expression on plasma cells, as well as significant
production of sTie-2 receptor and SCF, reflecting the
MM niche.

Normal PC are terminally differentiated and unable
to proliferate [51]. Similarly, primary malignant PCs
have a low proliferation index in vitro, whereas the tumor
microenvironment promote MM survival and proliferation
[3]. Although MM cell lines can proliferate in vitro,
they are mostly derived from plasma cell leukemia and
have lost BM dependency. Therefore, it is questionable
how far we can force the malignant PC to proliferate.
Our data showed that both ex vivo conventional 2D
monolayer and 3D MSC co-culture systems increased
proliferation of primary malignant PC, with a higher
proliferation index in the 3D model. Moreover, the
impact of autologous and allogeneic conditions did not
reveal any significant differences in proliferation of PC,
suggesting that autologous MM derived-MSC may not
be required in the co-culture system. Interestingly, SP
fraction representing stem cell-like cells was upregulated
in MM cells when co-cultured with 3D MSC versus the
2D system. Finally, CXCR4 was significantly increased
on PC in the 3D system and previous data showed CXCR4
expression increased in SP cells in co-culture with MSC
[52], suggesting MM homing and adhesion mediating their
survival.
Progression of MM is associated with immune
suppression that interferes with tumor elimination
and an effective antitumor response. Recent evidence
indicates that interactions among tumor cells, stromal
cells, and immune cells regulate anti-tumor immunity.
Specifically, stromal signatures can predict for survival
[53], as can immune T cells and macrophages in the tumor
microenvironment [54]. Moreover, interactions among
the malignant clone, stroma, and immune cell subsets
engender an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment
[55]. Here we therefore incorporated not only MSC/
stromal and tumor cells in our 3D model, but also immune
cells. Applying the CyTOF technology resulted in highdimensional data that allows for the quantification of
phenotypically and functionally distinct immune cell
subsets. Importantly, we used an antibody panel tailored
to innate and adaptive immune cells, manual gating
strategies, as well as clustering algorithm by SPADE
approach, to define immune cell subsets. Our results
demonstrated that distribution of immune cells can be
readily assessed in our 3D MSC co-culture model, which
will allow for defining both the role of immune accessory
cells and the effects of novel chemo-/immune-based
therapies.
Although commonly sensitive to novel therapies,
MM cells develop resistance underlying disease relapse.
The emergence of resistance may be due to very complex
microenvironmental-tumor cell interactions in bone
marrow [56]. Therefore, we next evaluated sensitivity of
MM cells to IMIDs (THAL, LEN and POM); proteasome
inhibitors (BTZ and CFZ); and conventional drugs (DEX,
DOXO and MELPH) using our 3D MSC co-culture
system. Our results showed significant resistance of MM

cells to THAL and LEN; BTZ; and conventional anti-MM
(DEX, DOXO and MELPH) therapies reflecting clinical
resistance. We next evaluated sensitivity of MM cells from
4 patients to POM or CFZ in this system, and similarly
demonstrated profiles reflecting clinical sensitivity versus
resistance. These preliminary studies need to be validated
in prospective trials, but do suggest that our 3D co-culture
system may predict for clinical utility of novel therapies.
In conclusion, in this study we investigated the role
of the marrow microenvironment in MM. Interactions
among malignant PC, immune accessory cells, and
MSC/stromal cells with ECM, integrins, and other niche
molecules which mediate disease development and
progression were characterized using a hydrogel based 3D
ex vivo co-culture system. Importantly, the 3D co-culture
closely mimics MM marrow physiology and therefore
provides a model to now explore growth of MM clones
associated with drug resistance and minimal residual
disease. Importantly, it may identify novel mechanisms
to target to interrupt these processes. Ultimately the 3D
co-culture model may assess tumor cell sensitivity to
conventional and novel anti-MM therapies, and thereby
inform single agent or combination individualized therapy.

respective lineage differentiation media, as described in
Supplemental Methods. MM cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA,
USA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro,
Mediatech, VA, USA) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 2mM L-glutamine, 100 U/
mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.

Establishment of 2D and 3D cultures
The MSC (8×104 cells/cm2) were seeded on plastic
surface in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(DMEM; Cellgro, Mediatech, VA) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL
penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and maintained at
37°C in 5% CO2 to establish monolayer (2D) cultures.
For generation of 3D models, 0.5% PuraMatrix hydrogel
(5mg/ml; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) diluted in
tissue culture-grade water was placed on the well surface.
For gelation, complete DMEM medium was slowly and
carefully added and incubated for 30min at 37°C in 5%
CO2. After incubation, the medium was changed 2-3
times over a period of 1 hour to equilibrate the growth
environment to physiological pH. MSC (8x104 cells/cm2)
were then seeded on the surface of the pH equilibrated
hydrogel.

Patient samples and cell cultures
Overall BM samples from 52 patients with
premalignant condition or MM were studied including:
smoldering MM (N=8), newly diagnosed MM (N=5),
relapsed MM (N=23), and relapsed/refractory MM
(N=16). Approval for these studies was obtained from
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Review
Board. All patient samples were collected after informed
consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
protocol. After BM aspiration (Figure 1A, i), fresh BM
mononuclear cells (MNC) were obtained by ammonium
chloride based-lyses of red cells (iii), followed by washing
