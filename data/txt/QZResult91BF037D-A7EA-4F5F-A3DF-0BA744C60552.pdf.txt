ABSTRACT
The interactions of multiple myeloma (MM) cells with their microenvironment
are crucial for pathogenesis. MM cells could interact differentially with their
microenvironment depending on the type of cyclin D they express. We established
several clones that constitutively express cyclin D1 from the parental RPMI8226
MM cell line and analyzed the impact of cyclin D1 expression on cell behavior. We
performed a gene expression profiling study on cyclin D1-expressing vs. control cells
and validated the results by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of cyclin D1
altered the transcription of genes that control adhesion and migration. We confirmed
that cyclin D1 increases cell adhesion to stromal cells and fibronectin, stabilizes F-actin
fibers, and enhances chemotaxis and inflammatory chemokine secretion. Both control
and cyclin D1-expressing cells were more resistant to acute carfilzomib treatment
when cultured on stromal cells than in suspension. However, this resistance was
specifically reduced in cyclin D1-expressing cells after pomalidomide pre-treatment
that modifies tumor cell/microenvironment interactions. Transcriptomic analysis
revealed that cyclin D1 expression was also associated with changes in the expression
of genes controlling metabolism. We also found that cyclin D1 expression disrupted
the redox balance by producing reactive oxygen species. The resulting oxidative stress
activated the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (or ERK1/2) signaling pathway,
increased cell adhesion to fibronectin or stromal cells, and controlled drug sensitivity.
Our results have uncovered a new function for cyclin D1 in the control of redox
metabolism and interactions of cyclin D1-expressing MM cells with their bone marrow
microenvironment.

INTRODUCTION

proteins. Thus, it has been proposed that dysregulation of
one CCND gene encoding cyclin D is a unifying event
of MM pathogenesis [2]. Paradoxically, MM tumor cells
are mostly low proliferating even though the major role
of cyclins D is to regulate the progression through the G1
phase and the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle [3].
The oncogenic potential of cyclin D1, is largely
due to its cell cycle regulating function when associated
with its cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 partners [4].
In addition, other CDK-dependent or -independent noncanonical roles of cyclin D1 may be important for tumor

Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable
hemopathy characterized by the accumulation of
clonal plasma cells within the bone marrow and the
overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin. The
clinical signs of MM are immunodeficiency, recurrent
infections, renal failure, and bone lesions [1]. Myeloma
tumor cells are characterized by genomic abnormalities
including chromosomal number and structural variations.

initiation, maintenance, progression, and metastasis [5].
Almost 45% of tumors in MM patients express cyclin
D1 but, paradoxically, this expression is associated with
a favorable prognosis [6]. We established two series of
clones derived from RPMI8226 MM cells expressing either
a cyclin D1-green fluorescent (GFP) fusion protein (D1GFP) or GFP alone to elucidate the molecular functions of
cyclin D1 in MM [7]. We found that cyclin D1 alters the
expression of genes involved in the regulation of the cell
cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and protein synthesis, in
agreement with the well-known functions of cyclin D1 but,
unexpectedly, also of cell metabolism, including the redox
balance. We further studied how cyclin D1 controls the
redox status and how this affects cell adhesion, migration,
and the response to drugs, in particular, cell adhesionmediated drug resistance (CAM-DR).

same clones using a chemotaxis assay in which cells
seeded in transwell inserts are attracted by growth factors
present in fetal calf serum (FCS). Cyclin D1 expression
increased the migration capacity of cells (Figure 1B)
which was confirmed by rhodamine-phalloidin staining of
filamentous (F-) actin and confocal microscopy analysis
(Figure 1C). We also observed increased adhesion and
migration for other clones derived from LP1 and L363
parental MM cell lines expressing exogenous cyclin D1
(data not shown).
We used the Proteome Profiler™ Human Cytokine
Array to detect which chemokines/cytokines were
produced by cyclin D1-expressing cells. Cyclin D1
increased the production of CD54 or ICAM1, interleukin
(IL)8, and CXCL10 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand
10) also known as interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP10).
It also stimulated the production of CCL5 (chemokine
(C-C) motif 5), also known as RANTES (regulated and
normal T-cell expressed and secreted). These chemokines/
cytokines are all involved in inflammatory processes and
cell adhesion (Figure 1D).
We conclude that cyclin D1: 1) increases cell
adhesion on fibronectin and stromal cells; 2) increases the
synthesis of the adhesion molecule ICAM1; 3) increases
the production of inflammatory chemokines such as IL8,
IP10, and RANTES; and 4) favors cell migration.

RESULTS
Cyclin D1 expression in myeloma cells alters
various cell functions
We previously established several clones expressing
either GFP or cyclin D1(D1)-GFP fusion proteins from the
RPMI8226 parental MM cells (hereafter referred to as 8226
cells) [7]. Two independent clones from each series were
further used in this study. We verified the expression of the
exogenous proteins both by flow cytometry and western
blot analysis (Supplementary Figure 1A). As expected,
D1-GFP-expressing clones proliferated more rapidly than
GFP-expressing clones (Supplementary Figure 1B). This
indicates that cyclin D1 was fully functional. We performed
whole-genome expression profiling to identify genes for
which the expression is altered by cyclin D1. As reported
earlier [7], the comparison of GFP- and D1-GFP-expressing
cells showed that cyclin D1 altered the transcription of
genes involved in DNA and protein synthesis, cell cycle
regulation, apoptosis, and inflammation as expected, but
also genes involved in metabolism, membrane trafficking,
and adhesion/migration [Gene Expression Omnibus:
GSE59673].

Pomalidomide decreases the cell adhesionmediated drug resistance of cyclin D1-expressing
myeloma cells
Carfilzomib is a second-generation proteasome
inhibitor for the treatment of MM [14]. However, its
in vivo half-life is very short [15], similar to that of
bortezomib, widely used in clinical practice [16]. We either
chronically (5–30 nM for 24 h) or acutely (50–500 nM for
a 1 h-treatment followed by a 24 h-culture) administered
carfilzomib or bortezomib to cultured GFP- and D1-GFPexpressing clones and analyzed cell viability using an MTSbased assay. D1-GFP-expressing cells were more sensitive
to bortezomib than GFP-expressing to chronic treatment
with bortezomib but not carfilzomib (Supplementary
Figure 2A). However, cyclin D1 increased the sensitivity
to acute treatments with either bortezomib or carfilzomib
(Supplementary Figure 2B). We further confirmed this
result by quantifying apoptotic (APO2.7-positive) cells
after carfilzomib treatment of cells cultured either in
suspension or on a layer of HS-5 stromal cells (Figure 2A).
The interaction MM with bone marrow cells is responsible
for CAM-DR [17–21]. Consistent with these observations,
both GFP- and D1-GFP-expressing cells cultured on HS-5
cells were more resistant to carfilzomib than when cultured
in suspension (Figure 2A). The co-culture of 8226-, LP1,
and L363-derived clones on fibronectin-coated plates
demonstrated CAM-DR for all clones (data not shown).
Immunomodulators (IMIDs), such as pomalidomide are

Cyclin D1 increases cell adhesion and migration,
and chemokine secretion
Cyclin D1 is involved in the regulation of adhesion
and migration. Ablation of CCND1 reduces migration
of macrophages, fibroblasts, and mammary epithelial
cells [8–11]. In breast cancer cells, cyclin D1 interacts
with cytoskeletal proteins and controls migration [12]. In
keratinocytes, cytoplasmic cyclin D1 regulates cell-matrix
adhesion [13]. We assessed the capacity of GFP- and D1GFP-expressing clones to adhere to fibronectin or HS-5
stromal cells after their staining with calcein-AM. Cyclin
D1 expression increased cell adhesion to both substrates
(Figure 1A). We assayed the migration capacity of the

drugs that modify the interactions between tumor cells
and their microenvironment by targeting adhesion proteins
[22]. GFP- and D1-GFP-expressing clones, cultured
in suspension or on stromal cells, were co-treated with
pomalidomide and carfilzomib and the induced apoptotic
response evaluated. Treatment with 1 μM pomalidomide
for 72 h did not trigger apoptotic death of cells cultured in
either setting (Figure 2A). The combination of carfilzomib
and pomalidomide did not have an additive effect on GFPexpressing cells. In contrast, co-treatment increased the
apoptotic response of cyclin D1-expressing cells when
cultured on HS-5 cells (Figure 2A), and significantly
decreased CAM-DR (Figure 2B), thus uncovering a celladhesion dependent effect of cyclin D1 on drug resistance.
Taken together, these observations suggest that cyclin D1
decreases the sensitivity of MM cells to carfilzomib by
modulating of MM cells/microenvironment interactions.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential
mediators of cell adhesion and migration [23]. We thus
analyzed the redox state of cyclin D1-expressing clones.
We used the CellROX® Deep Red Reagent, a fluorogenic
probe, to measure the cellular oxidative status. Cyclin D1
increased the production of ROS (Figure 3A). ROS are
mainly produced by mitochondria and a family of NADPH
oxidases or NOX [24]. We and others have shown that
cyclin D1 can negatively regulate mitochondrial respiration
[25, 26]. We further analyzed the metabolic profiles of
GFP- and D1-GFP-expressing cells using the Seahorse
XF96 analyzer which simultaneously records mitochondrial
respiration and glycolysis. D1-GFP-expressing cells had the
same oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as GFP-expressing

Figure 1: Cyclin D1 controls cell adhesion, cell migration, and cytokine production. (A) 96-well plates were coated with

fibronectin or HS-5 stromal cells. GFP- and D1-GFP-expressing clones were stained with calcein-AM and seeded. After incubation for
3 or 24 h at 37°C, non-adherent cells were removed by extensive washing. The plates were read with the Victor ×4 plate-reader. The
percentage of cell adhesion was calculated by the ratio fluorescence of adherent cells/fluorescence of total cells x 100. Presented results
corresponded to the mean of four independent experiments with five replicates. (B) GFP- and D1-GFP expressing clones were seeded in
the top chamber of transwell inserts. The inserts were then placed in culture medium with FCS (+) or without FCS (−) as a control for
specificity. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C, and the number of migrating cells within the bottom of the insert was counted by flow
cytometry. The results presented correspond to the mean of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. (C) GFP- and D1-GFPexpressing clones were cytospun on glass slides, stained with rhodamine-stained phalloidin for visualizing F-actin and counterstained with
DAPI. The slides were analyzed with a confocal microscope (×180, magnification). (D) The Cytokine Array kit (panel A) was used for
the detection of cytokines secreted in the culture medium by GFP- and D1-GFP clones. The assay procedure was performed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Spots corresponding to positive controls (C+), negative controls (C−), and produced cytokines are circled.

cells (Supplementary Figure 3). These results show that
cyclin D1 did not affect the mitochondrial respiration rate in
MM cells. However, the NADPH/NADP+ ratio decreased
in cyclin D1-expressing cells (Figure 3B) suggesting
increased NOX activity as the availability of its main
substrate NADPH was unlimited, in contrast to myeloid
cells [27]. The treatment of 8226-derived clones with the
pan-NOX inhibitor VAS3947 significantly decreased ROS
production in cyclin D1-expressing clones (Figure 3C),
confirming the involvement of NOX in cyclin D1-mediated
ROS generation.
Cells regulate their intracellular ROS content by
balancing ROS production and scavenging systems. We
next tested whether the expression of cyclin D1 modifies
the expression of detoxifying enzymes. We performed semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments to analyze the expression
of 28 major detoxifying enzymes (Supplementary Table 1).

We observed no significant (0.5 < RQ < 2) differences
between cyclin D1-expressing and non-expressing clones
(Figure 3C). Thus, cyclin D1 disrupts the cellular redox
balance by increasing ROS production without modifying
the expression of scavenging enzymes encoding genes.

Inhibition of ROS production reverses the cyclin
D1-mediated phenotype
Redox homeostasis modulates myeloma cell drug
sensitivity [28–30]. We tested whether the redox state could
control adhesion/migration properties of MM cells since the
interaction of MM cells with their microenvironment also
regulates their responses to drugs. We used N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) to inhibit ROS production. Cyclin D1-expressing
clones were pretreated with NAC before being assayed for
adhesion on fibronectin or HS-5 stromal cells (Figure 4A),

Figure 2: Cyclin D1 controls the sensitivity of cells to carfilzomib. (A) GFP-expressing Cl7 and D1-GFP-expressing Cl4,

either in suspension or in co-cultures with HS-5 cells, were treated with 1 μM pomalidomide (P) or with vehicle, as a control, for 72 h.
The cells were then treated with 50 nM (C50) or 100 nM (C100) carfilzomib for 1 h and further cultured for 24 h. The cells were then
stained with anti-APO2.7 Ab and analyzed by flow cytometry. At least, 2 × 104 events were gated for each culture condition. The mean of
four independent experiments is indicated in the graph together with the SD. (B) CAM-DR was calculated by the formula: percentage of

or for migration (Figure 4B). We observed that NAC
induced a decrease in the number of both adherent and
migrating cells. We did not observe these effects in
GFP-expressing cells (Supplementary Figure 4A, 4B).
NAC treatment decreased ROS production in cyclin D1expressing clones (Figure 4C), suggesting that the redox
stress imposed by cyclin D1 is responsible for enhanced
adhesion and migration properties.

model of transient expression by transduction of a TATcyclin D1 fusion protein in B cells to further confirm
this observation [26]. TAT-cyclin D1 protein was rapidly
transduced into Ramos cells, and detected as soon as
3 h after the addition of the protein in the culture medium
(Figure 5B). After 24 h, TAT-cyclin D1 began to be
degraded by the proteasome pathway and was no longer
detected after 48 h (data not shown, and ref. 26). Cyclin
D1 triggered the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Figure 5B)
and S6K (Supplementary Figure 5B) after the addition
of the fusion protein in the culture medium, consistent
with our observations in cyclin D1-expressing MM cells.
The treatment of cyclin D1-expressing cells with NAC
inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 proteins and
the activation of the pathway (Figure 5C). In contrast,
S6K phosphorylation was not affected by NAC treatment
(Supplementary Figure 5A, lower panel). Thus, the redox
state resulting from the presence of cyclin D1 is necessary
for ERK1/2 activation.
We next used rapamycin and PD0325901 to inhibit
S6K and ERK1/2 activation, respectively (Supplementary
Figure 6A, 6B) to assess the role of their activation on

Cyclin D1 activates the ERK 1/2 pathway
We next studied which signaling pathways were
activated following cyclin D1 expression and ROS
generation. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2
(or p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase) and p70S6
kinase (S6K) phosphorylation was higher in cyclin
D1-expressing cells (Figure 5A and Supplementary
Figure 5A, upper panel). In contrast, AKT, p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), and STAT3/5 were not
activated (data not shown). These results demonstrate
that cyclin D1 specifically activates the ERK1/2 and
S6K signaling pathways. We used a previously described

cell adhesion and migration. The inhibition of S6K
phosphorylation did not modify the capacity of cyclin D1expressing cells to adhere to stromal cells or to migrate
(Supplementary Figure 6C, 6D). In contrast, the inhibition
of ERK1/2 phosphorylation decreased the adhesion
of cyclin D1-expressing cells to stromal cells without
perturbing their migration (Figure 5D, 5E). We concluded
that the redox state imposed by cyclin D1 expression

migration in an ERK1/2-independent, manner.

adhesion, the latter through the activation of the ERK1/2
pathway. To our knowledge, this cyclin D1/ROS/ERK1/2
axis has not been described previously and is particularly
relevant for the group of MM patients whose tumor cells
express cyclin D1 (CD1/2).
MM is characterized by the development of plasma
tumor cells that dynamically and bidirectionnally interact
with their bone marrow microenvironment. The genetic
and phenotypic heterogeneity of MM may consequently
operate at the level of tumor cell/tumor microenvironment
interactions [31, 32]. The relationship between the types
of soluble and/or physical factors and the molecular
groups of MM are largely unknown, except for a high
level of β7 integrin associated with the molecular group
of MM patients expressing the MAF transcription factor
[32]. We report here that cyclin D1 expression increases
the expression of ICAM1, and the synthesis of pro-

inflammatory chemokines IL8, IP10, and RANTES,
all able to alter the tumor microenvironment. Thus, the
interaction of MM cells with their tumor microenvironment
largely depends on their genetic background.
Several studies have reported that cyclin D1 controls
cell adhesion and migration of various cell types and
tumors and, consequently, their metastatic potential [8–12,
33]. In mantle cell lymphoma cell lines and primary cells
(tumor cells harboring the t(11;14)(q13;q32) and expressing
high levels of cyclin D1), sorafenib inhibits cell migration
by interfering with B-cell receptor signaling and cyclin
D1 translation [34]. In the cell model we have developed,
cyclin D1 expression results in increased adhesion of
MM cells on fibronectin and stromal HS-5 cells. In
sharp contrast with solid tumors for which adhesion and
migration are inversely coordinated, cyclin D1 also confers
greater migratory capacity. We found that ICAM1 was oversynthesized and the chemokines IP10, RANTES and IL8
overproduced in cyclin D1-expressing cells. How cyclin
D1 regulates chemokine and interleukin production is an
open question. Our transcriptomic data showed that cyclin
D1 expression did not modify CXCL10, CCL5, or CXCL8
genes transcription [7 and data not shown], suggesting
that cyclin D1 may act at a post-transcriptional level. In
mouse fibroblasts, cyclin D1 is localized to trans-Golgi and
exocyst-rich regions, binds small GTPases RalA and B, and

the exocyst protein SEC6, all involved in the regulation of
exocytosis [35]. As plasma cells possess highly developed
secretory machinery, this is a reasonable hypothesis.
We have previously shown that IP10, RANTES, and
IL8 are secreted by MM cells and that IP10 and RANTES
are over-produced after genotoxic stresses, resulting in a
senescence-associated secretory phenotype which allows
MM cells to migrate [36]. The common response of MM
cells exposed to X-irradiation, DNA damaging agents, or
constitutive cyclin D1 expression is ROS generation [36
and this study]. MM cells exhibit higher intrinsic oxidative
stress than normal cells, as do most cancer cells, and are
adapted to this redox status. This is achieved by the upregulation of thioredoxin (TRX1) and thioredoxin reductase
(TRXR1), which are ROS scavengers and regulators of
redox enzymes [37]. The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib
and carfilzomib, which are widely used in the clinic, induce
apoptosis by increasing intracellular ROS levels and
generating an oxidative stress [38, 39]. This is considered
to be a “side effect” of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress generated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins
and the stimulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR)
pathway. We previously showed that cyclin D1 expression
in MM cells activates the UPR pathway and favors cell
death through the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic
reticulum kinase (or PERK)/activating transcription factor

4 (or ATF4)/CCAAT enhancer binding homologous protein
(or CHOP) axis [7]. Thus, cyclin D1 may indirectly impair
redox homeostasis through an UPR-mediated ER stress in
MM cells. However, bortezomib and carfilzomib act also
directly via the transcriptional repression of mitochondrial
thioredoxin reductace (TXNRD2), a ROS detoxifying
enzyme that maintains the intracellular redox status [40].
We found no transcriptional modification of detoxifying
enzymes associated with cyclin D1 expression. In contrast,
we showed that the generation of ROS, that perturbed the
redox balance, was due to the activity of NOX or dual
oxidases (DUOX) and their associated subunits.
NOX/DUOX proteins belong to a family of
flavoproteins that transports electron across biological
membranes and generates ROS [41]. The most common
NOX isoform found in B cells is NOX2 (gp91phox/
cytochrome b558). NOX2 produces ROS in B cells and
participates into lymphoma and leukemia cells death [42,
43]. How NOX and their regulatory subunits are regulated
in MM cells and how cyclin D1 controls the expression,
assembly and activity of the various NOX complexes,
merits further investigations. NOX links NADPH
metabolism and migration in myeloid cells transformed
by oncogenic tyrosine kinases [27]. Moreover, oncogenes
with tyrosine kinase activity, such as BCR/ABL, Flt3ITD, and c-Kit, alter the redox homeostasis in leukemic
cells contributing to proliferative and anti-apoptotic
effects [27]. Cyclin D1 is an oncogene that alters genomic
stability, survival, growth and adhesion/motility [5], all
which are potentially controlled by ROS production.
We show that ROS signals through the activation
of the ERK1/2 pathway in MM cells in agreement with a
previous report [44]. Moreover, we show that the downregulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, using a specific
inhibitor, decreases the adhesion of MM cells. The
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade plays a central role in the
regulation of MM cell adhesion, migration, and homing
[45]; this is in good agreement with our data.
Myeloma cell death can be achieved through
the generation of ROS that follows ER stress and UPR
activation [46]. Elevating the level of intracellular ROS
in myeloma cells synergizes with various compounds
to inhibit MM cell growth or/and trigger apoptosis [47,
48]. Manipulating redox parameters could improve the
therapeutic response of MM patients, especially for those
belonging to the cyclin D1-expressing group.

from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were dissolved in
dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), except NAC which was
dissolved in ethanol (EtOH). For controls, the vehicle was
added to the same final concentration.

Cell lines and cell culture, and transduction of
TAT-cyclin D1 fusion protein
8226-derived clones were maintained in RPMI 1640
medium (Lonza) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine
(Lonza), 10% FCS (PAA Laboratories) and antibiotics
(Lonza). 8226 cells were purchased from DSMZ (ACC402). The 8226 GFP- and D1-GFP-expressing clones were
obtained after stable transfection of the corresponding
expression plasmids, selection with Geneticin, cloning by
limiting dilution, and analysis by flow cytometry on FL1fluorescence. This strategy has been previously described in
detail [7]. The transduction method of TAT-cyclin D1 protein
in B cells has been previously described in detail [26].

Detection of intracellular ROS	
Intracellular ROS were detected using the oxidationsensitive fluorescent probe CellROX® Deep Red reagent
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Quantitative determination of the NADP/
NADPH ratio
The determination of the NADPH/NADP+ ratio
(from 106 cells) was performed using the NADP+/NADPH
Assay Kit (ab176724, Abcam). This colorimetric assay was
carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The optical density was read at 450 nm with the Victor™
X4 plate-reader (Perkin Elmer). The protein concentration
was determined for each sample and the values represented
as picomoles NADPH and NADP+ per μg of lysate.

Adhesion and chemotaxis assays
96-well plates were coated overnight at room
temperature with fibronectin (10 µg/ml in PBS,
100 µl/well), and extensively washed in PBS. The human
stromal cell line HS-5, obtained from the ATCC (CRL11882), was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium containing antibiotics, L-glutamine and 10% FCS.
HS-5 cells (2 × 104 cells) were seeded in a volume of 100 µl
in each well of 96-well plates and cultured for two days until
they reached confluence. Cell adhesion was assessed with
the Vybrant™ Cell Adhesion Assay Kit (V-13181, Molecular
Probes). Briefly, MM cells were harvested, washed, and
labeled with calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM,
1 mM) for 30 min and stained cells (5 × 104/well) were
seeded on fibronectin- or HS-5-coated plates and incubated
at 37°C for 3 or 24 h. After extensive washing to remove

MATERIALS AND METHODS

non-adherent calcein-labeled cells, the plates were read using
the Victor 4 (Perkin Elmer) to measure the fluorescence of
adhering cells (Ex 494 nm/Em 517 nm). Bovine serum
albumin (BSA)–coated wells served as negative controls,
and poly-L-lysine–coated wells served as positive controls.
For the cell migration or chemotaxis assay, cultured
MM cells (5 × 105 cells per insert) were washed and
suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5%
BSA. They were added in the top chambers of transwell
inserts (Millicell® Hanging Cell Culture Inserts 8 μm PET,
Millipore). The filters were transferred to wells containing
medium with 10% FCS as chemoattractant. As a control for
the specificity of the assay, FCS-free medium was added
in the lower chamber. The plates were then incubated for
4 h at 37°C and cells migrating to the lower chambers were
counted by flow cytometry (300 s under constant flow).

Tech. The Abs against cyclin D1 (sc-718), β-actin (sc47778), and β-tubulin (sc-9104) were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotech. The secondary Abs were goat antirabbit or anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated IgGs (Abcam).
For densitometric analyses, images were captured with a
ChemiDoc™ XRS+ molecular imager and analyzed using
Image Lab™ software (Bio-Rad). The background of
each image was subtracted from the bands of interest, then
the densities of each protein were normalized against the
density of β-actin used as a control housekeeping protein.
The ratios of the normalized values: p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 are
indicated under the corresponding blots.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses
Cultured cells were washed once in PBS and total
RNA was isolated from pelleted cells using the Trizol
reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript®
VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). PCR primers
(Supplementary Table 1) were designed using ProbeFinder
software (Roche Applied Software). cDNAs, primers
(0.25 μM), and LightCycler® TaqMan® Master mix were
mixed in a final volume of 10 μl and PCR-amplified
in a LightCycler® 480 Instrument II (Roche). The
amplification parameters were the following: an initial
denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, 45 cycles at 95°C for
10 s, and 60°C for 30 s, and a final cooling step at 40°C
for 30 s. The GAPDH gene was used as an internal gene
for normalization. Each reaction condition was performed
in triplicate. Relative gene expression was evaluated by
the 2−ΔΔCt method.

Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal
microscopy analysis
Cells (105 cells per spot) were cytospun on
Superfrost glass slides, at 500 × g for 3 min, then fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and permeabilized
by incubation with 0.5% Triton-X100 (v/v) for 5 min.
The slides were then stained with a rhodamine-stained
phalloidin probe (Molecular Probes) for selectively
visualizing F-actin, and DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole dihydrochloride, Molecular Probes) for
nuclear counterstaining. The slides were mounted, and
analyzed with a Fluoview FV 1000 confocal microscope
and Fluoview Viewer software (Olympus).

Apoptosis assessment

Statistical analysis

MM cells were treated with 50−100 nM carfilzomib
or/and 1 μM pomalidomide and stained with PEconjugated anti-APO2.7 antibody (Ab) and analyzed by
flow cytometry. For co-culture experiments, HS-5 and
MM cells were stained with APO2.7-PE- and CD10-APCconjugated antibodies (Miltenyi). Only CD10-negative cells
corresponding to myeloma cells were analyzed.

The Student’s t-test was used to determine the
significance of differences between two experimental
groups. Data were analyzed by two-tailed tests, with
p < 0.05 (*) considered to be significant.
