Abstract
Tumor cells frequently exhibit decreased adhesiveness due to
failure to deposit stromal fibronectin (FN), permitting more
rapid proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis.
Although up-regulation of FN has been noted in gene profiles
of carcinomas compared with normal tissue, reduced FN
expression has been described at the peripheral margins of
invading tumors. In this study, we investigate the role of FN in
cancer behavior. Using human thyroid carcinoma cells with
stably down-regulated FN, we performed gene profiling and
created an orthotopic mouse model. We stably overexpressed
the FN target, MAGE A3, which has also been identified as a
target of the breast cancer risk factor fibroblast growth factor
receptor 2, and examined the functional effects in vitro and
in vivo in a flank model and an orthotopic model of thyroid
cancer. Mouse xenografts showed significantly enhanced
tumor growth as well as larger and more numerous lung
metastases in response to FN silencing. Gene profiling
identified the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE A3) as
significantly up-regulated in response to FN silencing. Forced
expression of MAGE A3 resulted in p21 down-regulation,
accelerated cell cycle progression, increased cell migration
rate, and invasion in vitro and in vivo in an orthotopic mouse
model where microcomputed tomography confirmed lung
metastases that recapitulate the progression of human thyroid
cancer. We conclude that MAGE A3 is a functional integrator
of diverse signals, including FGFR2 and FN, to modulate
cancer progression. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):8104–12]

Introduction
Thyroid carcinomas have a very wide spectrum of differentiation
from some of the most indolent papillary microcarcinomas to the
most invasive and lethal anaplastic malignancies (1). This
spectrum of progression has been linked with a pattern of
cumulative genetic defects that correlate with tumor differentiation, metastatic potential, and aggressiveness (1). Thus, thyroid
cancer provides a model to examine the effects of targeted
modulation of cell growth and differentiation in human neoplasms
of varying degrees of differentiation and with specific genetic
defects.
Neoplastic transformation is often characterized by changes in
the organization of the cytoskeleton, decreased cell adhesion, and
aberrant adhesion–mediated signaling (2). Disruption of normal

cell adhesion contributes to enhanced proliferation, migration, and
invasion leading to metastasis. Fibronectin (FN) is an extracellular
matrix protein with putative roles in mediating these actions.
Indeed, tumor cells with decreased adhesiveness frequently fail to
deposit stromal FN (3). In particular, reduced FN expression has
been noted in transformed cell lines and primary tumors (4),
including thyroid cancer (3, 5, 6), where diminished FN has been
identified at the periphery of invasive tumor margins. In this
context, we found that down-regulation of FN stimulates thyroid
cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth (7). Conversely, 1,
25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 treatment increases cell adhesiveness and
inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth through enhanced FN
expression (7).
To determine the role of FN in mediating disease progression, we
examined the effect of FN down-regulation on cancer metastasis
using an orthotopic mouse model of thyroid cancer. We used this
system to identify, through gene profiling, novel putative intracellular targets of FN action. The data uncover the melanomaassociated antigen 3 (MAGE A3) as a mediator of FN action, a
clinically relevant outcome in the human form of this malignancy.
MAGE A3 was also recently identified as a target of fibroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 signaling (8). As the latter is the
same FGFR member linked in genome-wide arrays with increased
breast cancer risk (9, 10), the current studies are particularly
relevant to establish the integrative role of MAGE A3 in response to
diverse signals to modulate cancer progression.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The human thyroid follicular WRO carcinoma cell line,
originally established by Dr. G. Juillard (University of California at Los
Angeles, Los Angeles, CA), was kindly provided by Dr. J. Fagin (MemorialSloan Kettering, New York, NY). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 1  nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics.
TPC-1 cells, a well-differentiated papillary carcinoma cell line, were cultured
in DMEM with 5% serum and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (11).
Transfections. Cell transfections were performed using Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen Corp.). Cells were cultured in 6-cm plates until 60% to 70%
confluent and transfected with 5 Ag of the human MAGE A3 cDNA in
pcDNA3.0 (12). One day after transfection, cells were placed into selection
medium containing 1 mg/mL G418 (Invitrogen) and individual geneticinresistant colonies were screened by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and
Western blotting. At least two independent stably transfected clones were
used for subsequent studies. The target sequence for FN down-regulation,
AAC AAA TCT CCT GCC TGG TAC, was aligned to the human genome
database in a BLAST search to exclude homology with unrelated genes. The
shRNA oligonucleotide templates were as follows: top strand, GAT CCG
CAA ATC TCC TGC CTG GTA CTC TGC AGG AGT ACC AGG CAG GAG
ATT TGT TTT TTG GAA A; bottom strand, AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA CAA
ATC TCC TGC CTG GTA CTC CTG CAG AGT ACC AGG CAG GAG ATT
TGC G. These were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Ambion, Inc.). After annealing, the duplexes were ligated into pSilencer 2.1U6 neo vector as described previously (7).

Fibronectin and MAGE A3 in Cancer Progression
Oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Total RNA was extracted from
cultured cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc.) as described previously (8).
Array hybridization to the Affymetrix human U133Plus2 GeneChip was
conducted at The Centre of Applied Genomics (Hospital for Sick Children,
Toronto, Canada). RNA from two independent FN-shRNA clones and two
independent scrambled control clones were subjected to in vitro
transcription, labeling, and hybridization using standard Affymetrix
reagents. Hybridized chips were washed, and scanned on an Affymetrix
GeneChip 3000 confocal scanner. Raw microarray data were analyzed by
ArrayAssist software (Iobion) using the PLIER algorithm as described
previously (13). Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if the
signal changed at least 2-fold (or signal log2 ratio 1). The four data sets (two
for FN-shRNA and two for scrambled controls) were analyzed using gene
expression and statistical tools in Spotfire’s DecisionSite software package.
To identify gene targets that had significantly altered gene expression, FNshRNA transfected clones versus scrambled control groups were compared
with each other using the Student’s t test as described previously (13).
RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from
cultured cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc.) followed by DNase I
treatment. cDNA was generated using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription
Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems). PCR primers MAGE A3/6 and
phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)-1 (as an internal control) were previously
described (8). Amplification was performed using HotStarTaq DNA
polymerase kit (Qiagen). PCR conditions were as follows: (a) 95jC for
15 min; (b) 30 cycles of 94jC for 30 s, 56 or 58jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 1
min; (c) 72jC for 10 min; and (d) 4jC hold. Negative controls omitting
reverse transcriptase and positive controls were included in each PCR
reaction (data not shown).
Protein extraction and Western blotting. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, 100 Ag/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and sodium
orthovanadate in PBS). Total cell lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min
followed by microcentrifugation at 10,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. Fifty
micrograms of protein were separated by 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide
electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were
blocked in 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS [20 mmol/L Tris-Cl
and 500 mmol/L NaCl (pH 7.5)] for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4jC with
the following primary antibodies: MAGE (6C1; 1:200; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.), p21 (1:500; BD Biosciences), p27 (1:1,000; Transduction
Laboratories), phospho-Rb (Ser807/811; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology),
human p53 (DO-1; 1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse p53
(1:1,000; Chemicon International), and actin (1:500; Sigma). After washing,
membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:2,000;
Santa Cruz). Protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence as
recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham).
Cell cycle analysis. For cell cycle assessment, cells were starved in serumfree growth medium for 24 h before being exposed to growth medium
containing 10% FBS for another 24 h. After trypsinization, cells were washed
with D-PBS (Ca2+-Mg2+ free) and fixed with cold 80% ethanol for 1 h on
ice. Fixed cells were washed with staining buffer [0.2% Triton X-100 and
1 mmol/L/l EDTA (pH 8.0), in PBS] and resuspended in the staining buffer
containing 50 Ag/mL DNase-free RNase A (Sigma) and 50 Ag/mL propidium
iodide for 1 h. Cell cycle analysis was performed by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (Becton Dickinson) using Cellquest analysis and specific S phase
was analyzed using Modfit DNA Analysis (Verity Software House, Inc.).
Migration assay. Migrations assay was performed as described
previously (14). Control and MAGE A3–tansfected cells were plated on
collagen IV–coated 24-well plates (BD Biosciences). After reaching
confluence, cells were gently scratched using a standard 200 AL tip, rinsed
thrice, and allowed to migrate on a collagen IV surface. Serial photographs
were obtained every 10 min for 20 h using an Axiovert 200 M phase-contrast
microscope. A video was constructed from the individual frames taken
every 20 min for 20 h. Data from experiments performed in duplicate are
expressed as the mean SE from three independent experiments.
Invasion assay. Invasion assay was performed as described previously
(14). Briefly, BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers (BD Biosciences) were

pretreated by the manufacturer. After trypsinization, 2  104 cells
suspended in 0.5 mL of serum-free RPMI1640 medium containing 0.2%
bovine serum albumin were plated in each insert. After 24 h of incubation,
noninvading cells were removed from the upper surface of the membrane
by scrubbing with a cotton swab. Cells on the lower surface of the
membrane were stained with Diff-Quick Stain (BD Biosciences). After air
drying, membranes were removed from the insert; invading cells in the
whole membrane were photographed using a Slide Scanner and analyzed
for quantification.
Xenografted mouse models of thyroid cancer. WRO cells (5  106)
forced to express MAGE A3 and their empty vector control were xenografted
in the flanks or orthotopically implanted in the neck of 5 to 6-wk-old severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice for assessment of tumor growth
and metastasis. Animal handling and treatment protocols were approved by
the Ontario Cancer Institute Animal Care and Utilization Committee.
Tumor growth and volume were measured using calipers every 5 d (tumor
volume in mm3 = tumor width  tumor length  tumor length/2).
Metastases were assessed by computed tomography (CT) scanning after
isofluorane-induced anesthesia. Micro-CT imaging of the mice was
performed using a GE Locus Ultra scanner (GE Healthcare) operated at
80 kVp and 50 mA. The images were reconstructed with a voxel size of 154 
154  154 Am. Mice were sacrificed 21 to 26 d after inoculation at which
point tumors were excised and measured. Excised tumor and lung tissues
were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for light microscopy and
immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemistry. Cultured cells were washed in cold D-PBS
(Ca2+-Mg2+ free) thrice, gently scraped off and centrifuged into pellets that
were coated in 2% bactoagar until solidified. Cell pellets were fixed in 10%
neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Fourmicrometer-thick sections from cell pellets, harvested xenografted tumors,
or paraffin-embedded tissue were dewaxed in five changes of xylene and
rehydrated through graded alcohols into water. Sections were then heattreated inside a decloaking chamber (Biocare) as previously optimized in
10 mmol/L citrate buffer at pH 6.0 except for MAGE, which was retrieved
with Tris-EDTA buffer at pH 9.0. Endogenous peroxidase and biotin
activities were blocked, respectively, using 3% hydrogen peroxide and an
avidin/biotin blocking kit (Lab Vision). Sections were treated for 15 min
with 10% normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories) and then incubated with
the appropriate primary antibody. The primary reactions were as follows:
anti-MAGE (6C1) mouse monoclonal antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz) overnight;
p21 (1:300; BD PharMingen) overnight; p27 (1:1,000; BD Transduction
Laboratories) for 1 h; p53 (1:300; Novocastra) for 1 h. This incubation was
followed by 30 min each with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector
Laboratories) and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated Ultra Streptavidin
Labeling Reagent (ID Labs., Inc.). Color development was performed with
freshly prepared NovaRed solution (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Finally, sections were dehydrated through
graded alcohols, cleared in xylene, and mounted in Permount (Fisher).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean F SE. Differences were
assessed by Student’s paired t test. Significance level was assigned at a
P level of <0.05.

Results
Down-regulation of FN promotes lung metastasis of thyroid
cancer. Established stable lines of FN-deficient human thyroid
carcinoma WRO cells have been previously described (7). This
down-regulation of FN stimulates thyroid tumor growth in flank
xenografts (7). To specifically examine the effect of FN on
metastasis development, we used an orthotopic mouse model of
thyroid cancer (15). This approach confirmed that down-regulation
of FN promotes tumor growth in situ (Fig. 1A) and also showed
that loss of FN is associated with a significantly increased number
and size of lung metastasis (Fig. 1B). In particular, only 1 of 9
control mice developed a single small metastatic lung lesion. In
contrast, 6 of 9 mice injected with cells stably transfected with FN

shRNA developed multiple lung metastases (P < 0.05), which were
also significantly larger in size (Fig. 1B).
Down-regulation of FN increases MAGE A gene expression.
To investigate the specific targets of FN, we performed cDNA
microarray profiling comparing human thyroid cancer WRO cells
expressing FN si-RNA or scrambled sequence. The majority of
spotted genes were not affected by FN down-regulation. However,
FN down-regulation increased the expression of MAGE A family
genes (Table 1). Comparison of these cells by RT-PCR and by
Western blotting confirmed an increase of MAGE A3 expression
(Fig. 2A). Similarly, immunohistochemical examination of cell
pellets and corresponding xenografted mouse tumor tissues
confirmed MAGE A3 up-regulation in response to FN shRNA
(Fig. 2B).
MAGE A3 stimulates thyroid cancer cell proliferation in vitro.
To examine the functional role of MAGE A3, we forced its stable
expression in WRO cells (Fig. 3A). Using flow cytometry, we found
that MAGE A3 significantly reduces the proportion at G0-G1 phase
and increases entry into S phase (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this

finding, MAGE A3 decreased p21 levels, but not p27, to promote Rb
phosphorylation (Fig. 3C).
MAGE A3 down-regulates p21. MAGE proteins can function as
cofactors supporting KAP1-dependent suppression of p53 action
(16, 17). To better understand the mechanism underlying MAGE A3
action, we tested the effect of this cancer antigen on p21 as a target
of p53 action. In WRO cells, which harbor a heterozygous p53
mutation, forced MAGE A3 expression resulted in diminished p21
levels (Fig. 3D). The same effect was also seen in MAGE A3transfected human TPC-1 thyroid carcinoma cells that harbor wildtype p53 (Fig. 3D). These findings suggest that MAGE A3 can
down-regulate p21 in the presence of wild-type or mutant p53.
MAGE A3 promotes cell migration and invasion in vitro. To
further investigate the functional effect of MAGE A3 expression, we
examined the ability of MAGE A3 to influence cell migration on a
collagen IV matrix. We found that MAGE A3 significantly promotes
cell migration as determined by dynamic video monitoring
(Supplementary videos 1 and 2) and illustrated in static images
(Fig. 4A) and calculated migration rate (Fig. 4B).

(arrow ), whereas mice injected with cells expressing FN-shRNA developed multiple larger metastatic lesions (arrows ).

To determine the effect of MAGE A3 on cell invasion, we
examined independent clones of WRO cells with forced MAGE A3
expression and their controls using a Matrigel invasion assay.
These studies showed that MAGE A3 significantly promotes cell
invasion (Fig. 4C).
MAGE A3 promotes thyroid tumor growth and lung
metastasis in vivo. To study the effect of MAGE A3 on tumor
growth in vivo, we used a thyroid cancer flank xenograft mouse
model as previously described (7). This showed that tumor volume
was significantly increased in response to forced MAGE A3
expression (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, using an orthotopic model, we
found that MAGE A3 significantly promotes tumor growth.
Specifically, 14 of 17 animals in the MAGE A3 group developed
metastases (Fig. 5B) compared with 3 of 20 in the control pcDNA
group (P < 0.001). The development of pulmonary metastases was
monitored in vivo by micro-CT imaging (Fig. 5C) that showed more
numerous and larger metastatic foci in animals bearing tumors
that expressed MAGE A3. Histopathologic examination confirmed

more numerous and larger lung metastases in the MAGE A3 group
(Fig. 5D, left) compared with control animals that had minimal
lung involvement. Furthermore, we identified selective strong
MAGE A3 immunostaining in metastatic tumor deposits (Fig. 5D,
right) providing additional evidence for the involvement of this
oncogene in metastasis formation.

Discussion
The present findings along with our previous work (7) support
an important role for FN in cancer progression. We show that
down-regulation of FN stimulates thyroid cancer cell proliferation,
accelerates cell migration and invasion, and promotes neoplastic
growth in vivo. More strikingly, using an orthotopic mouse model
of thyroid cancer, we show that the loss of FN significantly
enhances lung metastasis, a feature that closely mimics an
important element of the human disease. These findings are
consistent with a model wherein FN acts as a tumor suppressor to

impede tumor progression and metastasis. FN staining has been
reported to be reduced or diminished in many solid neoplasms (4)
including thyroid cancer, where diminished stromal FN expression
has been noted at the periphery of invasive tumor margins (3).
Conversely, up-regulation of FN has been identified in gene profiles
of thyroid carcinomas compared with normal tissues (18, 19).
These findings suggest that up-regulation of FN in well-differentiated carcinomas may represent a compensatory response to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

neoplastic transformation. In contrast, dedifferentiated tumors
may reach a point of diminished capacity to lay down FN within
the stroma. Such a model would explain the remarkable biological
difference between well-differentiated and dedifferentiated thyroid
carcinomas.
In the present study, we used stable shRNA-mediated FN downregulation to identify targets of its action in thyroid cancer. Using
cDNA microarray profiling, we uncovered significant increases of

MAGE A3 levels in the face of loss of FN. This melanomaassociated AntiGEn is a member of a group of >50 closely related
peptides (20) classified into 2 major subgroups based on their gene
structure and expression profiles (21). Subgroup 2 MAGE members
are expressed in various normal adult human tissues (21). In
contrast, subgroup 1 members, including MAGE A, B, and C, are
expressed only in normal testis, placenta, and certain stages of
embryonal development (21, 22). However, MAGE A members have

been identified in a variety of malignant tumors (23). MAGE
proteins are also called cancer-testis antigens (24) as they are
recognized by autologous CTLs in a MHC class I–restricted fashion
(25). Based on their immunogenicity in cancer, MAGE or cancertestis antigens represent ideal targets for cancer vaccines (26).
Indeed, immunotherapeutic trials targeting MAGE peptides have
achieved encouraging results in patients with metastatic melanoma (27–29).

examination with H&E staining confirms a

tumors composed of cells transfected with
MAGE A3 but not in control mice.

MAGE was first reported to encode a tumor-specific antigen in
melanoma cells (25). It is expressed in esophageal (30), breast (31),
lung (32), bladder (33), gastric (34), and leukemic cells (35).
Recently, MAGE antigens have also been reported in human
thyroid carcinomas (36) where immunodetection suggested
involvement at an early stage in disease progression. However,
there is currently limited functional evidence implicating MAGE A3
action in cancer progression.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

In the present study, we investigated the functional role of MAGE
A3 using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Forced MAGE A3
in human thyroid carcinoma-derived WRO cells, which are
endogenously deficient of MAGE A, resulted in accelerated cell
cycle progression with diminished G0-G1 residence and enhanced S
phase entry. These cell cycle changes were accompanied by
reduced p21 levels and enhanced Rb phosphorylation. Indeed,
MAGE A3 significantly diminished p21 levels in TPC-1 cells with

intact p53 and in WRO cells, which are heterozygous for a p53
mutation. Although recent reports implicate MAGE A members in
modulating p53 function (16, 17), our data suggest the possibility of
p53-independent action of MAGE A3 in targeting p21.
Using a mouse flank xenograft model, forced expression of
MAGE A3 significantly stimulated tumor growth. These findings
are consistent with one other report where a pan MAGE A
shRNA inhibited human melanoma cell proliferation and
diminished growth in mouse xenografts (17). Our study shows,
for the first time, that selective MAGE A3 expression significantly
promotes tumor cell migration and enhances invasive cancer cell
growth. More significantly, these effects were accompanied by
increased tumor metastasis as shown in a mouse orthotropic
model of thyroid cancer. Furthermore, the resulting metastatic
deposits were larger and more numerous in the face of forced
MAGE A3 expression. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the observed effect of MAGE A immunoreactivity
correlation with lymphatic vessel invasion in ductal breast
cancer (37) and with lymph node metastasis in gastric
carcinoma (38). However, it must be emphasized that other
MAGE A genes members, such as MAGE A4, have been reported
to promote apoptosis in non–small cell lung cancer (39). In
addition, MAGE D1 may represent a novel endogenous inhibitor
of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (40). These pleiotropic
functions highlight the importance of detailed MAGE characterization to better understand the putative actions of the various
family members in cancer progression.
The mechanisms of FN-induced MAGE A3 induction requires
further examination. It is clear that MAGE A gene family members
are regulated through epigenetic mechanisms including DNA and
histone modifications (41). FN is an extracellular matrix protein,
which plays a key role in the regulation of cell adhesion, migration,
invasion, and metastasis formation. It can be envisioned that FN

down-regulation might force cells to lose adhesiveness and
enhance their migratory and invasive properties. Furthermore,
the pivotal role of MAGE A3 in thyroid cancer progression was
underscored through its recent identification as a signaling target
of FGFR2 (42). Indeed, FGF7-mediated activation of FGFR2 results
in down-regulation of MAGE A3 through enhanced histone 3 K9
methylation (8). Given the recent linkage of FGFR2 in genome-wide
studies with increased breast cancer risk (9, 10), the current
elucidation of the role of MAGE A3 in integrating diverse signals
will also prove critical to clarify breast cancer progression.
In summary, this study shows that FN can act as a tumor
suppressor and an inhibitor of cell proliferation and metastasis.
Using combined in vitro and in vivo models, we show that downregulation of this adhesive factor significantly enhances MAGE A3
expression. MAGE A3, as a down-stream target of FN, accelerates
cell cycle progression through p21 reduction, an effect facilitated
by diminished p53 levels. Taken together, our findings highlight the
importance of MAGE A3 in cancer progression and provide a
strong rationale for this tumor-associated antigen as a potential
diagnostic and immunotherapeutic target in thyroid cancer
treatment.
