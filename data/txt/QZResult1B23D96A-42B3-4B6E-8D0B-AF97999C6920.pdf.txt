ABSTRACT
The identification and clinical validation of cancer driver genes are essential
to accelerate the translational transition of cancer genomics, as well as to find
clinically confident targets for the therapeutic intervention of cancers. Here we
identified recurrent LMNA-NTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1 fusions in Korean patients with
colon cancer (3 out of 147, 2%) through next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).
NTRK1 fusions were mutually exclusive oncogenic drivers of colon cancer that were
accompanied with in vitro potential of colony formation and in vivo tumorigenicity
comparable to KM12, a human colon cancer cell line harboring TPM3-NTRK1 fusion.
NTRK1-encoded TrkA protein was prevalent in 11 out of 216 Korean (5.1%) and 28
out of 472 Chinese patients (5.9%) from independent cohorts, respectively. The
expression level of TrkA was significantly correlated with NTRK1 fusion (p = 0.0192),
which was verified by a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Korean patients
with TrkA-positive colon cancer had a marginal but significant shorter overall survival
time than TrkA-negative colon cancer [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5346, 95% confidential
interval (CI) = 0.2548-0.9722, p = 0.0411]. In addition, KM12 cell line was sensitive
to selective TrkA inhibitors. These results demonstrate that NTRK1 fusion is granted
as a clinically relevant target for therapeutic intervention of colon cancer.

INTRODUCTION

incidence rates of total CRC increased by 6.2% and 6.8%
for men and women, respectively, between 1999 and
2009 [1]. Although the mortality rate from CRC started
to decline among younger generations and women, it is
still ranked as one of the most common causes of cancerrelated death in Korea [2].
Over the past few decades, significant therapeutic
improvements have been made in the treatment of

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly
diagnosed cancer in the world. The incidence has been
rising sharply in some Asian countries, including Japan,
Singapore, and Korea, which were previously known as
low-risk areas in the last few decades. According to the
National Cancer Registry of Korea, the age-standardized

colon cancer are treated with fluoropyrimidine-based
chemotherapy in combination with or without irinotecan
or oxaliplatin [2]. Recently, molecularly targeted drugs
have been developed for use against specific cancers
and provide additional clinical benefits to patients.
These novel drugs, including cetuximab (Erbitux®;
Merck KGaA, Germany) and bevacizumab (Avastin®;
Genentech Inc., USA), have been approved for CRC
treatment and improve the survival rate by more than 30
% [3-8]. Nevertheless, there are serious limitations of the
targeted drugs to intervene with colon cancer because
the molecular characteristics of colon cancer is poorly
understood [9, 10], and the clinical benefit of targeted
therapeutics is still limited [11, 12].
Recent advances within cancer genomics identify
mutually exclusive oncogenic drivers to trigger a
personalized treatment in various cancers. However,
insufficient clinical characterization of the drivers often
led to the poor response in clinical trials with targeted
therapeutics [13-15]. Therefore, it is important to associate
the long-term clinical outcome of cancer patients with
certain genomic alterations through a systemic approach.
The overall goal of this study was to identify
clinically confident targets for the therapeutic intervention
of colon cancer. To this end, we performed RNA-seq with
tumors from Korean patients with colon cancer. From
sequence data, we analyzed gene fusions, differential
gene expression, and non-synonymous somatic mutations.
Gene fusions were verified by the sequencing of the
fusion transcripts, FISH, and immunohistochemistry. The
oncogenicity of the fusion genes was validated by an in
vitro colony formation assay and an in vivo xenograft
study with transformed cell lines with fusion transcripts.
The clinical effect of the fusion genes was addressed
by analyzing the prevalence and the overall survival
of the patients having the genomic alterations from an
independent retrospective cohort.

(MSI-H). Clinical follow-up demonstrated that 23 of 150
patients (15.3%) have experienced disease progression
within three years of diagnosis (Table S1). RNA-seq
generated a median of 118.5 million mappable reads
with a lower base call accuracy of 99% (Q20) = 94.3%
(Figure S1 and Table S2). Principle component analysis
(PCA) with 18,725 expressed genes from individual
tumors revealed three outliers (Figure S2 and Table S2);
therefore, 147 tumors and 47 matched normal controls
were used for gene fusion analysis. We applied GFP
[16], defuse [17], and FusionMap [18], and nine in-frame
fusions were found based on two out of three algorithms
with discordant paired-end reads, as well as a spanning
read cutoff = 10 and a chromosomal distance cutoff = 100
Kb when intrachromosomally rearranged. Gene fusion
was validated by exon expression analysis of donor and
acceptor genes (Table S3). Those included PTPRK-RSPO3
in two patients (1.4%), NAGLU-IKZF3, GTF3A-CDK8,
RAD51AP1-AKAP3, RASA1-LOC644100 in each single
patient (0.7%), and LMNA or TPM3-NTRK1 in three
patients (2%). We then further investigated NTRK1 fusions
because NTRK1, which encodes for membrane-bound
TrkA protein, has been shown to be rearranged with TPM3
in colon carcinoma [19] and papillary thyroid carcinoma
[20]. MPRIP-NTRK1 and CD74-NTRK1 were found in
lung adenocarcinoma [21], TP53-NTRK1 and LMNANTRK1 in Spitzoid neoplasm [22], RABGAP1L-NTRK1
in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [23], and NFASCNTRK1 and BCAN-NTRK1 in glioblastoma multiforme
[24]. To our knowledge, LMNA-NTRK1 fusion was not
reported in colon cancer. Furthermore, the prevalence
and the clinical relevance of NTRK1 fusions remain
largely unknown in colon cancer. The exon expression
of the NTRK1 gene was exclusively detected in tumors
harboring NTRK1 fusions (Figure 1A). Subsequently, we
confirmed the exon junctions in the fusion transcript of
LMNA-NTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1 by Sanger sequencing
(Figure 1B), and NTRK1-encoded TrkA expression by
immunohistochemistry (Figure 1C). NTRK1 gene fusion
was confirmed by a FISH assay with split FISH probes
on 5’- and 3’-end of NTRK1 gene (Figure 1D). Schematic
rearrangement of the NTRK1 gene (Figure 1E) and the
architecture of TrkA fusion protein demonstrated that
the protein kinase domain of the TrkA protein is well
conserved after gene fusion (Figure 1F).

RESULTS
The identification of NTRK1 fusions among
Korean patients with colon cancer
An RNA-seq cohort was composed of 79 male and
71 female patients with a median age of 60 at diagnosis.
The majority of the cancer was located in the ascending
colon (48 out of 150; 32%) or in the sigmoid (73 out
of 150; 48.7%). Half of the cancers were determined at
stage I (12 out of 150; 8%) or stage II (63 out of 150;
42%), and the other half were at stage III (75 out of 150;
50%). Microsatellite analysis revealed that 127 of 150
tumors (84.7%) were microsatellite stable (MSS), and 21
of 150 tumors (14%) had highly unstable microsatellites

Mutually exclusive oncogenicity of NTRK1 fusions
in colon cancer
Whereas the oncogenicity of NTRK1 fusions was
well characterized in papillary thyroid carcinoma [25]
and lung adenocarcinoma [21], it remains to be elucidated
in colon cancer. To address the oncogenicity of LMNANTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1 fusions in colon cancer, we
conducted in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches.

clinicopathological effects of the NTRK1 fusions in colon
cancer. In subsequent analyses of the oncogenicity of
NTRK1 fusions, we generated LMNA(e6)-NTRK1(e11)
or TPM3(e8)-NTRK1(e9, e11, e12) fusion transcripts
harboring plasmid DNA for cell transformation. TrkA
protein from a transformed NIH3T3 cell line with the
fusion transcripts was well expressed (Figure 3A). The
NIH3T3 cells overexpressing LMNA-NTRK1 (376 ± 33
colonies) or TPM3-NTRK1 (243 ± 46 colonies) formed
a significantly larger number of colonies than nontransformed cells (1 ± 2 colonies, p < 0.01), which was
comparable to KM12 (285 ± 36 colonies) (Figure 3B).
We then evaluated the tumorigenicity of NTRK1 fusions
by inoculating immunocompromised athymic-mice with
the transformed cells. Tumors from the transformed cells
were palpable from day 18 of inoculation, and the volumes
of the tumors were comparable to KM12 on day 29 of
inoculation (Figure 3C). Although the expression level of

NTRK1 fusions were mutually exclusive to oncogenic
mutations in CRC (Figure 2). Tumors harboring NTRK1
fusions did not have non-synonymous somatic mutations
in KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and other putative oncogenes. In
contrast, somatic mutations in various suppressor genes,
including TP53, APC, and FBXW7, were observed in
NTRK1 fusion-positive tumors. It is noteworthy that most
of the suppressor mutations were found in the NTRK1
fusion-positive tumor with highly unstable microsatellites
(Patient ID: LGP088T). We removed potential germline
variants, as described in Methods. However, it is likely
that unpaired tumor tissues may have more somatic
variants than paired tumor tissues. Therefore, the negative
selection of somatic variants was preceded and revealed
the mutually exclusive oncogenicity of NTRK1 fusions
in colon cancer. Although we performed the clinical
follow-up of the patients, most of the patients were
diagnosed after 2010 and it is too soon to determine any

LMNA-TrkA fusion protein in NIH3T3 cells was less than
that of the other two fusion protein-expressing cell lines,
oncogenic activity was comparable with that of the other
fusion proteins. Therefore, these results demonstrated
that LMNA-NTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1 could be mutually

analysis. Split FISH signals were significantly detected in
TrkA-positive tumors (p = 0.0192, Figure 4C to 4D, Table
S4), but not in the TrkA negative tumors (Figure 4E),
thus indicating that TrkA protein expression was partly a
result of NTRK1 fusion. Among the 216 Korean patients,
42 patients (24.1%) were had died within 10 years after
diagnosis. All of the 216 Korean patients were divided into
two groups according to the cytoplasmic TrkA expression
level. Clinicopathological characterization revealed
that the tumors with cytoplasmic TrkA expression were
localized in the left colon (p = 0.0504) and frequent at the
T3 depth of invasion (p = 0.0437). TrkA positive tumors
were significantly associated with the occurrence of
perineural invasion/lymphovascular emboli (p = 0.0429),
and most of the tumors were microsatellite stable (p =
0.0024) (Table 1). In accordance with the histopathological
and molecular status of the tumors, Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis demonstrated that the survival time of TrkApositive patients was marginally but significantly shorter
than TrkA-negative patients (Figure 5, HR = 0.5346, 95%
CI = 0.2548 to 0.9722, p = 0.0411). Taken together, these
results imply that NTRK1 fusion could be a clinically
relevant target for the therapeutic intervention of colon
cancer.

Clinical relevance of NTRK1 fusions
The clinical relevance of NTRK1 fusion was
assessed with independent cohorts that were comprised of
216 Korean and 472 Chinese patients with colon cancer.
We investigated the prevalence of TrkA protein expression
by using tissue microarray (TMA) constructed from the
cohorts. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that
TrkA was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of the tumor
cells in 11 Korean (5.1%) and 28 Chinese patients (5.9%),
respectively, and the frequency of TrkA expression was
not significantly different between the two populations
(p = 0.1657) (Figure 4A). Those frequencies were higher
than our expectation from RNA-seq results. To verify the
correlation between TrkA protein expression and NTRK1
fusion, 15 tumor tissues with or without TrkA protein
expression from Korean patients were subject to FISH

were mutually exclusive to representative oncogenic mutations in colon cancer. Somatic mutations in various suppressor genes were
denoted including TP53, APC, and FBXW7, particularly in the MSI-H sample.

to the compound in the U.S. for the treatment of soft
tissue sarcoma (https://integrity.thomson-pharma.com).
In consistent with the previous study [21], KM12 was

proliferation as expected (Figure 6B). Taken together,
these results demonstrated that the use of TrkA kinasespecific inhibitors may provide a new therapeutic strategy
for targeted treatment not only for NTRK1 fusion-driven
lung adenocarcinoma and sarcoma but also for colon
cancer.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we applied RNA-seq to identify target
candidates for therapeutic intervention of colon cancer.

Gene fusion is one of the most important oncogenic
mechanisms due to uncontrolled protein expression
through the rearrangement of ubiquitously expressed
donor genes and acceptor oncogenes. RNA-Seq is
advantageous for the discovery of fusion genes compared
to the whole genome sequencing because it can identify the
fusion genes that are specifically translated into proteins.
Therefore, RNA-seq has been widely used to identify
active fusion genes. Our results confirm that RNA-seq is
an efficient tool to find fusion genes to drive colon cancer.
Especially, 3’-NTRK1 transcripts were expressed only in
tumors harboring LMNA-NTRK1 or TPM3-NTRK1 fusion
genes, and they were precisely concomitant with protein
expression (Figure 1). In the previous studies, TCGA
did not find NTRK1 fusion in CRC [9] and Genentech
reported a single TPM3-NTRK1 fusion out of 72 colon
tumors (1.4%) [10]. In the current study, we found one
LMNA-NTRK1 and two TPM3-NTRK1 fusions among
147 Korean patients with colon cancer. The frequency
of NTRK1 fusion was a little higher than in the previous
studies [10, 26], which could possibly be explained by
high pass paired-end transcriptome sequencing that we
applied. In addition, there could be ethnic differences in
the frequency of the fusion because we investigated the
Korean population only in the current study. In addition
to NTRK1 fusions, we found two PTPRK-RSPO3 fusions,
and each of NAGLU-IKZF3, GTF3A-CDK8, RAD51AP1AKAP3, and RASA1-LOC644100 fusion (Table S3).
Recurrent RSPO fusions have been known to occur in 10%
of colon tumors. RSPO fusions were mutually exclusive
with APC mutations and capable of potentiating Wnt
signaling [10]. The other fusions have not been reported
yet in various tumors, and their oncogenic potential
remains to be clarified. Therefore, with the development of
sequencing capability and bioinformatics analytics tools,
RNA-seq will eventually be an indispensable tool in drug
discovery and development.
Most genomic studies on cancer to date use tumor
tissues from a prospective collection [9, 10]. Many studies
have reported on the clinicopathological characteristics of
tumors harboring certain genomic alterations; however, a
lack of sufficient follow-up information makes obscure
the clinical relevance of certain genomic alterations.
Some tumors do not respond to treatments against
the genomics-based and preclinically-proven driver
oncogenic alterations, and insufficient clinicopathological
characterization of the cancer drivers may be the reason
for the failure of investigational new targeted drugs in
clinical trials. For instance, RET fusions were recognized
as oncogenic and drug-sensitive rearrangements in
approximately 1-2% of lung adenocarcinoma [16, 27] and
various multi-kinase inhibitors were actively investigated
to treat non-small cell lung cancer. However, the clinical
significance of RET and/or RET fusion genes is not fully
understood, which led to the failure to prove the clinical
benefit of vandetanib [28], sorafenib [29], and erlotinib
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[30]. The previous studies support how important the
confirmation of the clinicopathological relevance of
certain genomic alterations is to provide clinically
confident therapeutic targets. Therefore, to obtain
clinically relevant therapeutic targets, not only genomics
or preclinical evidence of oncogenicity, but also long-term
follow-up would be useful. We expect that the current
clinical evaluation, accompanied with a genomic analysis
of cancer, would accelerate the translational transition of
genomic research in cancer and find clinically confident
therapeutic targets from cancer genomics.
In this study, we observed that cytoplasmic TrkA
was strongly detected in 11 out of 216 Korean patients
with colon cancer (5.1%), and it was comparable to
the prevalence in Chinese patients (Figure 4). The
incidence of cytoplasmic TrkA was higher than that
of RNA-seq. We verified the immunohistochemical
results with FISH, and it turned out that NTRK1 fusion
was significantly correlated with the expression level of
TrkA protein. Therefore, it appears that NTRK1 fusion
could be a possible cause of TrkA overexpression. We
cannot exclude the fact that different patient cohorts for
RNA-seq and TMA could contribute this discrepancy.
Different molecular stability of NTRK1 mRNA and TrkA
protein, and different sensitivity of detection methods
by RNA-seq or immunohistochemistry may contribute
the discrepancy as well. Cytoplasmic staining in the
remainder of the specimen might represent undetected
NTRK1 fusions. Since we applied FISH on tissue slides,
probe penetration would be limited compared to cell or
metaphase chromosomes. Although RNA-seq is a very
sensitive genomic tool to identify fusion gene, it depends
on target RNA stability. Therefore, we anticipate that
immunohistochemistry accompanied with FISH could be
used for the prognosis of colon cancer-harboring NTRK1
fusion.
TrkA expression was higher in T3 stage tumors than
T1 and T2 tumors (p = 0.0437). With respect to lymph
node metastasis, TrkA expression was elevated in N1 and
N2 stage tumors relative to N0 stage tumor (p = 0.015). In
addition, the frequency of TrkA overexpression was higher
in microsatellite-stable tumors than microsatellite-unstable
tumors (p = 0.0024). In the survival analysis, high TrkA
expression was significantly associated with poorer overall
survival in colon cancer patients (Figure 5). These results
demonstrate that NTRK1 fusion, as well as NTRK1 fusionderived TrkA overexpression, would provide information
on the overall survival of the patients with colon cancer.
Furthermore, these alterations would give information on
the effect of a therapeutic intervention. It suggests that
NTRK1 fusion has the potential prognostic and predictive
significance in colon cancer.
Conclusively, we identified LMNA-NTRK1 and
TPM3-NTRK1 fusion genes in Korean patients with colon
cancer through RNA-seq. NTRK1 fusions were mutually
exclusive colon cancer drivers with tumorigenicity in cells

and in animals. Clinicopathological analysis demonstrated
that the proportion of patients with NTRK1 fusion-driven
TrkA expression was substantial in Korean and Chinese
patients with colon cancer, accompanied with poor overall
survival. Therefore, NTRK1 fusion was granted as a
therapeutic target to treat colon cancer.

Total RNA was extracted by using the RNAiso
Plus (Takara Bio, Japan). Extracted RNA was purified by
using the RNeasy Mini Kit accompanied with the DNase
I (Qiagen) treatment. RNA integrity was assessed on
the Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA), and tumor RNAs with
RNA integrity number (RIN) ≥ 6 were subject to RNAseq (Table S1). RNA-seq libraries were generated by
using the TruSeq RNA sample Preparation Kit (Illumina,
USA). Briefly, mRNA was enriched by using poly-T
oligo-attached magnetic beads, followed by mRNA
fragmentation by acoustic shearing. First-strand cDNA
was synthesized by using reverse transcriptase and
random hexamers, and second-strand cDNA by using
DNA polymerase I and RNase H. cDNA was subject to
adapter ligation, and then enriched with PCR to prepare
cDNA library. cDNA libraries were sequenced on HiSeq
2000 (Illumina) to obtain around 100 million paired-end
reads (2 x 101 bp).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Guideline compliance
All of the methods that are described in this
study were carried out in accordance with the approved
guidelines for the use of experimental animals and human
subjects.

Patients
This study was approved by the institutional review
boards (IRBs) of Chonnam National University Hwasun
Hospital and Pusan National University Hospital (PNUH),
Korea. Fresh frozen tissues resected between 2008
and 2012 from patients with primary colon cancer and
matched normal controls were used in this study. Informed
consent was obtained from all patients. Tumor tissues
were selected according to the tumor sample inclusion
criteria of the International Cancer Genome Consortium
(ICGC). Briefly, tumor tissues composed of more than
60% of tumor cells and less than 20% of necrotic cells
or normal cells on histological assessment were included.
Tumor tissues from patients who had a family history of
colon cancer were excluded. In total, 150 tumor and 50
matched normal tissues were analyzed.

Sequence data analysis
Sequencing reads from cDNA were aligned with the
NCBI human reference genome (hg19) by using GSNAP
[31] and TopHat [32] with a 5% mismatch allowance.
To minimize mRNA splicing-caused misalignment,
sequencing reads were also aligned to a custom human
reference cDNA consisting of 161,250 mRNA sequences
obtained from public databases (36,742 RefSeq, 73,671
UCSC, and 161,214 Ensembl) [33].

Gene fusion analysis
In-frame fusion genes were identified by using GFP
[16], and cross validated with defuse [17] and FusionMap
[18]. In GFP, putative fusion genes were identified
by using discordant read pairs on different genes and
exon-spanning reads on the exonic fusion breakpoint
of chimeric transcripts, followed by serial filtrations in
consideration of strand orientation, sequence homology
(E-value < 0.01), spurious reads (spanning < 10 bp), and
spanning read pattern to remove false positives. deFuse
and FusionMap were applied to find the actual location
of ambiguously aligned spanning reads with a computed
split-read analysis which harbored the fusion breakpoint.
The fusion gene was determined when it appears to be at
least two different algorithms with discordant paired-end
reads and a spanning read cutoff = 10 and a chromosomal
distance cutoff = 100 Kb when intrachromosomally
rearranged and out-frame fusions were discarded. It
follows read depth assessment in each exon after the
fusion breakpoint and determines whether they have been
abruptly overexpressed [34].

MSI analysis
Tumor DNA and matched normal DNA from
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were used
for MSI assessment using Bethesda markers (BAT26,
D5S346, BAT25, D17S250, D2S123). DNAs were
extracted by using the QIAmp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Germany). DNA purity and concentration were
measured by the ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop
technology, USA). Multiplex PCR was performed and
MSI was determined by amplicon size in consideration
of signal intensity. In case of the failure of MSI analysis
due to the poor quality of DNA, microsatellite status was
predicted based on total number of somatic mutations
including DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) alterations.

Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis

FISH

If not mentioned separately, DEG analysis was
performed by using GenePattern at Broad Institute
[35]. TopHat alignment was processed using publically
available Cufflinks [36] to assemble the reads into
transcripts. The number of reads aligned to each gene
was normalized by the fragments per kilobase of exon per
million (FPKM) [36]. We performed PCA [37] by using
the genes with FPKM > 0 in more than 80% of samples
and outlier samples that did not adhere to the position of
either tumor or normal were excluded in further analyses.
It resulted in a total of 18,725 genes from 147 tumor and
47 matched normal tissues. Differential gene expression
was computed by a pairwise 2-sided t-test (p < 0.05)
followed by Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison
correction [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. DEGs
were determined when the relative expression of genes in
tumors was at least 8 times higher than in normal control.

Commercially available split FISH probes were used
to detect NTRK1 fusion according to the manufacturer’s
guideline (Abnova, Taiwan). Briefly, a deparaffinized
and protease-treated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue section was denatured at 75°C and then
incubated with the TexRed-labeled probe on the 5’ end and
the FITC-labeled probe on 3’ end of NTRK1 overnight.
After washing and DAPI counterstaining (Abbott, USA),
the number and localization of the hybridization signals
were assessed. Tumors were determined to be NTRK1
fusion positive when more than 15 out of 100 nuclei
demonstrated break-apart 5’- and 3’-end signals.

Immunohistochemistry and clinicopathological
characterization
TrkA expression was confirmed on archival FFPE
tumor tissues and matched normal tissues with anti-TrkA
protein, C-terminal monoclonal antibody (OriGene, USA).
Brain ganglions and lymphocytes served as positive
and negative control, respectively. The prevalence of
TrkA protein expression was evaluated by using TMA
constructed from 216 Korean patients (PNUH cohort) and
472 Chinese patients with colon cancer (Biomax, USA).
HE-stained sections from each block were made to define
representative tumor regions. TMAs were comprised
of two cores of 2 mm each, and TMA blocks were used
for immunostaining. TrkA immunostaining was scored
semiquantitatively as follows: negative (-), weak (+),
moderate (++), strong (+++). Moderate-to-strong signal
was determined to be TrkA positive.

Non-synonymous somatic mutation analysis
Single nucleotide variances (SNVs) were identified
after GSNAP alignment on the custom human reference
cDNA. SNVs were defined according to the following
criteria: (1) the number of uniquely mapped reads at
the position ≥ 2, (2) the average base quality for the
position ≥ 20, (3) the allele ratio at the position ≥ 3%,
(4) the read depth at the position ≥ 10. Gene annotation
was done using RefSeq genes. Potential germline variants
were removed by using dbSNP137 at the minor allele
frequency > 1% of samples [38], variants in 59 normal
Korean individuals [33], and variants in 47 normal tissue
counterparts. However, it is likely that unpaired tumor
tissues might have more somatic variants than those of
paired tumor tissues; therefore, the negative selection of
somatic variants proceeded.

Exogenous expression of the NTRK1 fusion gene
in NIH3T3 cells
Plasmids containing genes of interest were
purchased from Origene (USA). LMNA(e6)-NTRK1(e11)
and TPM3(e8)-NTRK1(e9, e11, e12) fusion transcripts
were generated by the Overlap Extension PCR. Once
PCR products containing the fusion transcripts were
generated, they were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 (Life
Technologies, USA) harboring internal ribosome entry
site (IRES)-GFP gene using the Cold Fusion Cloning Kit
(System Biosciences, USA), and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. NIH3T3 cells were purchased from the
Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB, Korea) and maintained in
glutamine-containing DMEM medium supplemented with
10% heat inactivated New Born Calf Serum, penicillin
and streptomycin. All reagents were purchased from Life
Technologies if not mentioned separately. The fusion gene
expression vector or empty vector was transduced into the
NIH3T3 cells by using the FUGENE 6 (Roche, Germany).

RT-PCR and sanger sequencing
NTRK1 fusion transcripts were validated with RTPCR from cDNA by using the following primers and
conditions: LMNA(e6)-NTRK1(e11) fusion transcripts
were amplified at 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at
54°C, and 30 sec at 72°C with forward primer 5’-CCA
GGT GGA GCA GTA TAA GAA G-3’, reverse primer
5’-TGT GGG TTC TCG ATG ATG TG-3’ for 354-bp
product, and TPM3(e8)-NTRK1(e9, e11, e12) at 30 cycles
of 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 55.7°C, and 30 sec at 72°C
with forward primer 5’-AAG AAG ATA AAT ATG AGG3’, reverse primer 5’-CCG TGC CGC ATA TAC TCA AA3’ for 406, 553, or 712-bp products, respectively. Eluted
PCR products were inserted into TOPO TA vector (Life
Technologies, USA), and subjected to Sanger sequencing.
