Abstract
Early studies indicated that selective inflammatory immune cells in the prostate
tumor microenvironment might be able to influence prostate cancer (PCa) progression.
Here we found treating PCa cells with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) results
in the recruitment of more mast cells, which might then increase PCa cell invasion
via down-regulation of AR signals in 4 different PCa cell lines. Mechanism dissection
revealed infiltrating mast cells could decrease AR transcription via modulation of the
PRC2 complex with LncRNA–HOTAIR at the AR 5’ promoter region in PCa cells. The
consequences of suppressing AR may then increase PCa cell invasion via increased
MMP9 expression and/or increased stem/progenitor cell population. The in vivo
mouse model with orthotopically xenografted PCa CWR22Rv1 cells with/without
mast cells also confirmed that infiltrating mast cells could increase PCa cell invasion
via suppression of AR signals. Together, our results provide a new mechanism for
the ADT-enhanced PCa metastasis via altering the infiltrating mast cells to modulate
PCa AR-MMP9 signals and/or AR-stem/progenitor cell population. Targeting these
newly identified inflammatory mast cells-AR signals may help us to better suppress
PCa metastasis at the castration resistant stage.

INTRODUCTION

Mast cells function in many conditions including allergies,
angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and immunomodulation
of cancer [10, 11]. Mast cells were detected in the prostate
tumor microenvironment (pTME) and their expression
has been linked to the PCa progression [12]. There are
two different types of mast cells in tumors, intra- and
peri-tumoral mast cells. and they may play different roles
in tumor progression [12]. The intra-tumoral mast cells
play a protective role in tumor development yet the peritumoral mast cells play a negative role to promote tumor
progression [12]. Most mast cells were detected around the
peri-tumoral area in the pTME, and ADT with castration
may increase the recruitment of mast cells to PCa [13].

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most commonly
diagnosed cancer worldwide [1]. The androgen receptor
(AR) signals play critical roles for PCa initiation and
progression [2, 3] and androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) is the standard treatment for PCa at late stages,
with better efficacy during the first 12-24 months before
development into castration resistance [4-6].
A growing body of evidence suggests that several
immune cells (including macrophages, T cells, neutrophils
and mast cells) with their secreted inflammatory cytokines
may play roles to influence the PCa progression [7-9].

However, the detailed mechanism how recruited mast cells
may contribute to the PCa progression remains unclear.
Cancer stem/progenitor cells have been welldocumented to play important roles in tumor initiation
and metastasis [14, 15]. Earlier reports found that PCa
also contained stem/progenitor cells that might play
essential roles in prostate tumorigenicity and metastasis
[16, 17] and AR might play differential roles in PCa stem/
progenitor cells vs. PCa parental cells [18].
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is one of
the two classes of the polycomb-group proteins (PcG), and
this complex has histone methyltransferase activity and
primarily trimethylate histone H3 on lysine 27 [19, 20],
a mark of transcriptionally silent chromatin. It is believed
that PRC2, comprised of H3K27 histone methyltransferase
(HMTase) EZH2 and core components SUZ12 and EED,
initiates this histone modification and that the subsequent
Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) maintains this
modification and promotes chromatin compaction [21].
The long non-coding RNA, HOTAIR (for HOX
antisense intergenic RNA), is a human gene located on
the chromosome 12 [22]. It is the first example of an RNA
expressed on one chromosome that has been found to
influence transcription on another chromosome. HOTAIR

interacts with PRC2 [21] and is required for gene-silencing
of the HOXD locus by PRC2 [23]. Higher expression
of HOTAIR in primary breast tumors is a significant
predictor of subsequent metastasis and death [24].
Here we found ADT treatment of PCa resulted in
increased cell invasion via increased numbers of recruited
mast cells-PCa AR-MMP9 signals and alteration of the
AR-induced stem/progenitor cell population.

RESULTS
PCa cells treated with ADT using casodex or
enzalutamide recruit more mast cells
Early studies suggested that mast cells could be
recruited to various tumors cells, including PCa [12]. Here
we applied the Boyden chamber migration system to assay
the human mast cells (HMC-1) migration ability to LNCaP
and C4-2 cells after treatment with 10 μM casodex or 10
μM enzalutamide, and the results revealed cells treated
with both anti-androgens recruited more HMC-1 cells than
DMSO control treated cells (Figure 1A and 1B).

PCa cells have better capacity than normal
prostate cells to recruit more mast cells

Increased infiltrating mast cells to PCa enhanced
PCa cell invasion

We applied IHC staining in the human PCa samples
using the tryptase as a marker of mast cells, and found
more mast cells were recruited to the PCa as compared
to the adjacent normal prostate tissue (Figure S1A-B). To
confirm these in vivo clinical data, we assayed the HMC1 cells migration ability to PCa LNCaP cells vs. normal
prostate RWPE1 cells by using the Boyden chamber
migration system (Figure S1C), and the results showed
LNCaP cells have better capacity to recruit more mast
cells than normal prostate RWPE1 cells (Figure S1D-E).
Similar results were obtained when we replaced LNCaP
cells with other PCa cells, including C4-2, C4-2B and
CWR22RV1 cells (Figure S1D-E).
Together, both in vivo human clinical data and in
vitro cell co-culture data proved that PCa cells could
recruit more mast cells than normal prostate cells.

We then applied chamber invasion assays in coculture system (Figure 2A) to examine the consequences
of increased infiltrating mast cells on PCa progression. We
first treated HMC-1 cells with the differentiation reagent
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce the mast
cell differentiation and maturation. We then used these
matured mast cells HMC-1 co-cultured with 4 different
PCa cells (LNCaP, C4-2, C4-2B and CWR22RV1) for
their capacity to invade (Figure 2B). As shown in Figure
2C-D, PCa (LNCaP, C4-2, C4-2B and CWR22RV1) cells
with recruited mast cells all become more invasive in the
Boyden chamber invasion system, suggesting that the
recruitment of mast cells to PCa cells might increase their
invasiveness.

Figure 2: Increased infiltrating mast cells to PCa enhanced PCa cell invasion. A. The cartoon illustrated the invasion assay.

In brief, we co-cultured four different PCa cells with/without mast (HMC-1) cells for 2 days, and then washed out the HMC-1 cells. The
co-cultured PCa cells were collected and re-seeded in the 8 µm pore size insert wells pre-coated with matrigel to perform invasion assays.

Mechanism dissection why recruited mast cells
increased PCa cell invasion

PCa metastasis-related genes (Table S1) and found MMP9
was consistently increased in all four different PCa cell
lines (with many other metastasis-related genes increased
in one, two or three PCa cell lines, and qPCR and western
blot assays confirmed the increased MMP9 at both mRNA
(Figure 4A) and protein level (Figure 4B). Importantly,
we also demonstrated that knocking-down AR increased
MMP9 expression, yet suppression of MMP9 with the
inhibitor failed to alter the expression of AR, suggesting
MMP9 is a downstream target gene of AR (Figure 4C-D
and S3A-B) in C4-2 and CCWR22Rv1 cells.
Together Figure 4 and S3 suggest that recruited mast
cells may need to function through modulation of ARMMP9 signals to increase PCa cell invasion.

To dissect the molecular mechanisms why increased
infiltrating mast cells could increase PCa cell invasion,
we examined the AR expression since recent reports
demonstrated targeting PCa AR (with siRNA) could
increase PCa cell invasion [8, 25]. As shown in Figure
3A-B and S2 (for LNCaP and C4-2 cells), recruited HMC1 cells or conditioned media (CM) after co-culture with
PCa cells could decrease AR expression at both protein
and mRNA levels in all four PCa cell lines (LNCaP, C42, C4-2B and CWR22RV1). We further confirmed these
conclusions by demonstrating that co-culturing PCa cells
with HMC-1 cells could also decrease the expression
of AR downstream target genes including PSA and
FKBP5 expression in all four PCa cell lines (Figure 3C),
suggesting that more infiltrating mast cells to PCa could
increase PCa cell invasion via down-regulation of AR
signaling in PCa cells.
To further dissect the mechanism why infiltrated
mast cells suppressed AR signaling could increase PCa
cell invasion, we then applied focus-array with several

Recruited mast cells increased PCa cell invasion
via modulation of AR signals to alter the CD133+
stem/progenitor cell population
Early studies suggested that stem/progenitor
cells have higher invasive capacity to promote tumor
metastasis [26]. We were interested in whether infiltrating
mast cells could also increase PCa cells invasion via

no longer were able to significantly increase the CD133+
stem/progenitor cell population in PCa C4-2 cells (Figure
5D), suggesting infiltrating HMC-1 cells might function
through down-regulation of AR to increase PCa CD133+
stem/progenitor cell population.
Interestingly, we also confirmed the expression of
AR and MMP9 in PCa stem/progenitor cells population.
As expected, the MMP9 expression was up-regulated
(Figure S4A) but AR expression was down-regulated
significantly in CD133+ cells compared to CD133- cells
(Figure S4B), suggesting low expression of AR could
increase PCa invasion capabilities via increasing stem/
progenitor population after ADT.
Together, results from 4 different assays, stem/
progenitor cell markers (Figure 5A), cell sorting (Figure
5B), sphere formation (Figure 5C) and interruption
assay (Figure 5D), all suggest that enhanced mast

increasing the stem/progenitor cell population. We first
found co-culturing with HMC-1 cells could induce PCa
(LNCaP, C4-2 and C4-2B) cells to express more stem/
progenitor cell markers including CD133, Nanog and
CXCR4 (Figure 5A). We then applied flow cytometry to
analyze the percentage of CD133+ stem/progenitor cells
population in C4-2 cells, and results showed co-culturing
with HMC-1 cells could increase CD133+ stem/progenitor
cells population in C4-2 cells (Figure 5B). The sphere
formation assay also revealed that infiltrating HMC-1
cells could further increase the self-renewal capacity in the
C4-2 CD133+ stem/progenitor cell population (Figure 5C).
As expected, knocking-down AR in C4-2 cells with
AR-siRNA could also increase the CD133+stem/progenitor
cell population (Figure 5D). Importantly, applying an
interruption approach for blocking the AR function during
the co-culture system showed that infiltrating HMC-1 cells

progenitor cell population in PCa cells to increase PCa
cells invasion.

transcriptional level. The results showed that infiltrating
mast cells could decrease AR promoter transcriptional
activity (Figure 6A). Importantly, after screening many
candidate genes involved in the modulation of AR
transcriptional activity, we found lnc-RNA HOTAIR in
PCa cells could be increased after co-cultured with HMC1 cells (Figure 6B and S5A). We also found the increased
binding of lnc-RNA HOTAIR to PRC2 complex might
then increase binding to the AR promoter in C4-2 and
CWR22Rv1 cells after co-culture with HMC-1 cells
(Figure 6C and S5B). Since the PRC2 complex is a
silencing gene that requires HOTAIR for its binding to the
target genes, we then applied HOTAIR-shRNA to suppress
the PRC2 complex binding to the AR promoter. As shown
in Figure 6D, adding HOTAIR-shRNA in C4-2/HMC-1
co-culture system decreased the PRC2 complex binding
to the AR promoter (Figure S6) and further reversed the
HMC-1 cells suppression of AR expression. As expected,
with the HOTAIR-shRNA, the HMC-1 cells increased
PCa C4-2 cell invasion was also partially reversed (Figure

could suppress PCa AR expression
After confirming the AR down-stream signals (either
via AR→MMP9 or via AR→CD133+ stem/progenitor cell
population) play key roles for infiltrating mast cells to
enhance PCa cell invasion, we decided to dissect the AR
up-stream signals to see how infiltrating mast cells may
influence the AR expression in this co-culture system.
We first demonstrated that infiltrating mast cells
could decrease AR expression at the protein and mRNA
levels (Figure 3). We then constructed luciferase reporter
linked with AR promoter to confirm if infiltrating
mast cells could also decrease AR expression at the

After orthotopically xenografting 1x106 CWR22Rv1 cells
with or without 1x105 HMC-1 cells for six weeks, we
found (from IVIS image) increased metastatic foci in 6
out of 10 mice with xenografts of PCa and HMC-1 cells,
compared to only 3 out of 15 mice having metastatic
foci with CWR22Rv1 cells only (Figure 7A). We further
identified one mouse to have metastatic foci in the
diaphragm after sacrifice, suggesting 70% (7/10) of mice
xenografted with co-cultured PCa and mast cells have
metastatic foci vs. 20% (3/15) of mice xenografted with
PCa cells alone (Figure 7C). The metastasis foci were also
confirmed by staining PSA as compared with local tumor
(Figure S7).
H&E staining in those metastatic foci confirmed

Together, results from Figure 6A-E and S5-6
suggest that infiltrating HMC-1 cells may function through
modulation of lnc-RNA HOTAIR-PRC2 complexes to
suppress AR in PCa cells.

Increased PCa metastasis with recruited mast
cells in orthotopically xenografted mouse model
To demonstrate the above in vitro cell results in the
in vivo animal models, we then used a mouse model with
orthotopically xenografted PCa CWR22Rv1 cells that
were stably transfected with pCDNA-luciferase plasmid
to monitor the PCa progression with IVIS Imaging system.

the tumor progression via influencing the angiogenesis
[27]. Recent reports also found the infiltrated mast
cells in the peri-tumoral compartment could be a novel
independent prognostic marker for PCa, and it may also be
linked to the progression into the castration resistant stage
[12]. Our finding that recruited mast cells could enhance
PCa growth and invasion provides strong in vitro and in
vivo evidence to support mast cells roles in the late PCa
castration resistant stage.
Mechanism dissection found recruited mast cells
might function through modulation of AR signaling to
enhance PCa cell invasion, which is in agreement with
early studies showing targeting AR with AR-siRNA might

(Figure 7B). Importantly, IHC staining of AR and MMP9
expressions are also in agreement with in vitro co-culture
studies showing infiltrated mast cells could decrease AR
expression and increase MMP9 expression (Figure 7D-E).

DISCUSSION
The tumor microenvironment with selective
inflammatory immune cells plays an important role in PCa
progression [9]. Mast cells are one of these immune cells
that could be recruited into various tumor tissues to impact

lead to enhance PCa cell invasion via either TGF-β1/
Smad3/MMP9 signaling [25] or STAT3-CCL2/CCR2
signaling [8]. Importantly, we are able to link the lncRNA HOTAIR-PRC2 signaling as an upstream signal to
modulate AR at the transcriptional level. Early studies
indicated that methylation of the AR promoter CpG
islands might also be able to suppress the AR expression
at the transcriptional level in PCa cells [28, 29]. PRC2,
with H3K27 histone methyl transferase HMTase EZH2
and core components SUZ12 and EED, could influence
the chromatin compaction [21] and lncRNA-HOTAIR
(HOX antisense intergenic RNA) might interact with
PRC2 for gene-silencing with a mechanism involving the
methylation regulation [23]. With data showing mast cells
could increase lncRNA HOTAIR to promote the binding of
PRC2 complex (via SUZ12) to AR promoter CpG region
for the suppression of AR expression, the axis of lncRNA-HOTAIR to→AT promoter methylation→reduced
AR expression→increased PCa metastasis may represent
a key mechanism to control the PCa metastasis at the later
castration resistant stage.
Results from a Phase II study of abiraterone acetate
treatment for castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
patients found that 79% of patients have a decline in
PSA level of 50% or more, but 52% of PCa patients have
either increased new bone lesions or intensity of existing
bone lesions [30]. Cooperberg et al also reported the
increased PCa specific mortality in clinical patients after
ADT [31]. The recently published reports also found
increased expressions of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) marker following ADT [32], and Niu
et al found that TRAMP mice with knocked-down AR in
prostate epithelial cells also had increased metastatic PCa
with mice dying earlier than the wild type TRAMP mice
[33]. Finally, Lin et al demonstrated that ADT with the
anti-androgens casodex or enzalutamide could increase
the PCa cell invasion via either altering the TGFβ-1/
Smad3/MMP9 signals [25] or influencing the infiltrating
macrophages via reduced AR-mediated PIAS3 expression
and then enhanced pSTAT3-CCL2 signals (32). Here we
found another mechanism to explain why PCa cells treated
with ADT using casodex or enzalutamide could have
increased cell invasion via alteration of the recruitment
of mast cells. These new findings not only strengthen the
early conclusion that ADT with casodex or enzalutamide
could increase PCa cell invasion and may also provide a
potential new therapeutic approach via interrupting the
infiltrating mast cells and their induced lncRNA-HOTAIRPRC2 complex→AR→MMP9 signals.
In summary, our results concluded that infiltrating
mast cells could increase PCa metastasis via modulation of
lncRNA-HOTAIR-PRC2 complex→AR→MMP9 signals,
which may provide us a potential therapeutic approach
to better battle PCa metastasis via targeting this newly
identified signaling from infiltrated mast cells.

Mast cell recruitment assay
Mast cell migration was detected using a 24-well
transwell assay. Briefly, PCa cells were placed in the lower
chambers of the 24-well transwells. Mast cells (1x105
cells/mL) were then seeded in the upper chambers. The
upper and lower chambers were separated by an 8 μm
polycarbonate filter coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml,
sc-29011 Santa Cruz, Paso Robles, CA) and dried for 1
hr in the hood. The chambers were incubated for 4 hours
at 37°C. Filters were then scraped, washed, fixed with
cold methanol, and stained with 1% toludine blue. Cell
migration was measured by counting the number of cells
attached to the lower surface of the filter. Each experiment
was tested in triplicate. The results were expressed as the
mean ± SEM of the number of migrating cells.

Luciferase reporter assays

24-well (8 µm pores) transwell plates (Corning,
Lowell, MA) were used for invasion assays. For in vitro
invasion assays, the upper chambers of the transwells
(8 µm) were pre-coated with diluted matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Sparks, MD). Before performing invasion
assays, PCa cells were cultured with either mast cells or
CM for 48 hrs, and then wash out mast cells with PBS 3
times and then collected the co-cultured cells for further
experiments. In brief, 105 PCa cells (in serum free media)
and 10% serum containing media were plated in the upper
chambers. After 48 hrs incubation, invaded cells were
stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and positively stained
cells were counted. The cell numbers were calculated from
counting six random fields. Quantitation indicates mean of
triplicate repeats ± SEM.

Human AR promoter regions of 1.8kb and 7kb
were amplified and cloned into the pGL3 vectors as we
described previously [35], and obtained as a gift from Dr.
Yan Dong of Tulane University. The luciferase reporter
assays were performed according to the methods used
in a previous study [36]. PCa cells were lysed and the
luciferase activity was detected by the dual luciferase
assay using pRL-TK-luciferase as the internal control.
Each sample was normalized by pRL-TK-luciferase
activity, and data were presented as mean ± SEM from at
least three independent experiments.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (CHIP)
CHIP assay was performed as previously
reported [37, 38]. In brief, cell lysates were precleared
sequentially with normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-agarose. AntiSUZ12 antibody (2.0 µg) was added to the cell lysates
and incubated at 4°C overnight. For the negative
control, IgG was used in the reaction. Speciﬁc
primer sets designed to amplify a target sequence
within human AR promoter were: hAR: Forward,
5’- CGACAGCCAACGCCTCTTG-3'; Reverse, 5’CCTTGCTTCCTCCGAGTCTTTAG-3’; PCR products
were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis.

3D invasion assay
The PCa cells invasion were also assayed by using
3D matrigel assay. In brief, we thawed Matrigel on ice and
add 40 μl to each well of 8-well glass chamber slide (at 50
μl/cm2) and spread the Matrigel evenly, placed the slides
in the cell culture incubator and allowed the Matrigel
to solidify. We then plated 104 PCa cells into each well
with CM containing 5% Matrigel and 10 ng/ml EGF and
changed media every 4 days. PCa cells take about 7 days
to form acini-like structures. The number of structures in
each of 10 different random fields under 100× microscope
were counted.

Male 6- to 8-week old nude mice were used.
CWR22Rv1 cells were engineered to express luciferase
reporter gene (PCDNA3.0-luciferase) by stable
transfection and the positive stable clones were selected
and expanded in culture. 15 mice were injected with
PCa cells (1 x 106 of luciferase expressing cells, as a
mixture with Matrigel, 1:1) and other 10 mice were coinjected with PCa cells co-cultured with (HMC-1) (1 x
105) to anterior prostate (AP). Metastasis in live mice was
monitored by using a Fluorescent Imager (IVIS Spectrum,
Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA), following tail
vein injection of Luciferin, at 6 different time points (3,
4, 5, and 6 wks after injection). After a final monitoring
with the Imager, mice were sacrificed and the metastases
were further examined by H&E. All animal studies were
performed under the supervision and guidelines of the
University of Rochester Medical Center Animal Care and
Use Committee.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
analysis
Total RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen). 1 µg of total RNA was subjected to
reverse transcription using Superscript III transcriptase
(Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was
conducted using a Bio-Rad CFX96 system with SYBR
green to determine the mRNA expression level of a gene
of interest. Expression levels were normalized to the
expression of GAPDH RNA.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and proteins (20
µg) were separated on 10-12 % SDS/PAGE gel and then
transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica,
MA). After blocking membranes, they were incubated
with appropriate dilutions (1:1000) of specific primary
antibodies. The blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies and visualized using ECL system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY).
