BRAF, a Target in Melanoma
Implications for Solid Tumor Drug Development
Keith T. Flaherty, MD1 and Grant McArthur, MB, BS, PhD2

The successful translation of therapies targeting signal-transduction pathways that are activated by oncogenes has
provided a model for molecularly targeted therapy, and the identification of mutations in v-raf murine sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), a serine/threonine kinase, has turned the attention of the melanoma field toward this
concept. The current review indicated that BRAF represents an important target in cancer, in part because it is
present in 7% of all cancers and also because it represents the first intracellular signaling molecule that is activated
by point mutations for which single-agent therapy appears to have efficacy. Therapy for advanced melanoma has
progressed slowly over the past 3 decades, although significant advances have been made in other cancers with the
application of cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies. However, in melanoma, cytotoxic chemotherapies
have severe limits, chemotherapy does not convincingly improve on the natural history of metastatic disease and has
no role in the adjuvant setting, and cytokine therapy may have a niche in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings
but confers only a modest benefit to a small proportion of patients at the cost of severe toxicity. Thus, there are few
other cancers in which completely novel therapies are so highly prioritized in clinical research. Understanding
network of signal-transduction pathways and how that network may adapt to BRAF inhibition or mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase inhibition will point to the next generation of clinical trials investigating rational combination
regimens. The current investigations in melanoma will create a set of hypotheses to be tested in each cancer that

Therapy for advanced melanoma has progressed slowly over the past 3 decades, whereas significant advances have
been made with the application of cytotoxic chemotherapy and, more recently, targeted therapies in other cancers. The
application of cytotoxic chemotherapies that have disease-altering ability in other cancers has severe limits in melanoma.
Chemotherapy does not convincingly improve upon the natural history of metastatic disease and has no role in the
adjuvant setting. Cytokine therapy has a niche in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings but confers a modest benefit
to a small proportion of patients at the cost of severe toxicity. Thus, there are few other cancers in which completely
novel therapies are so highly prioritized in clinical research. The successful translation of therapies targeting signal-transduction pathways that are activated by oncogenes has provided a model for molecularly targeted therapy. The identification of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) mutations in 2002 was the watershed event that turned
the attention of the melanoma field to this concept.1
BRAF Biology
Raf kinases are components of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, a signal-transduction pathway that
transmits mitogenic signals from activated cell surface growth factor receptors under normal physiologic conditions.
RAF1 (formerly known as CRAF) is the most ubiquitously expressed and had been the most extensively studied of the
RAF isoforms (which also include the least studied, ARAF); however, it was reported previously that activating mutations
in RAF1 were very rare.2 BRAF is expressed most highly in neuronal tissues and melanocytes (both of neural crest origin)
as well as in testis and hematopoietic cells. MAP kinase kinase (MEK) is the only known substrate of BRAF, a distinguishing feature from RAF1 that can participate in other signaling events outside of the MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 1).3

The mutation listed is the most common amino acid substitution, whereas
the percentage represents all amino acid changes reported at that position.

Activating mutations in BRAF were described first
by the Sanger Institute in 2002.1 By far the most common
of the BRAF mutations, the T1796A point mutation,
results in a substitution of glutamic acid (E) for valine (V)
at position 600 of the amino acid sequence (formerly
referred to as the 599 position). The other mutations
observed in this panel, like the ‘‘V600E’’ substitution,
were in the kinase domain of BRAF. All other putative oncogenic mutations occurred in exons 11 and 15 (where
V600 mutations reside), which are in the kinase domain.
The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database currently indicates that the V600E mutation was present in 97% of 55,328 samples that
investigated as reported on August 31, 2009 (Table 1).2
The V600 lysine (V600K), aspartic acid (V600D), and arginine (V600R) mutations all have been characterized as
activating mutations, similar to V600E.1 A few of the
remaining BRAF mutations have been studied, and some
reportedly hyperactivate BRAF and MEK to the same
extent as V600E (eg, the substitution of glycine [G] for alanine [A] at position 469 of the amino acid sequence
[G469A]4), whereas other mutations have lower activity
(G466V4). Some members of this latter group have been
explored further and appear to be oncogenic, although
they activate RAF1, rather than MEK, to confer their
effect.4,5
In melanoma, the estimated range of BRAF mutation prevalence has been as low as 30% and as high as
70%.6,7 The largest reported clinical trial in which
patients’ tumors were analyzed for the presence of

BRAF mutations identified them in 50% of

ent only in papillary or anaplastic cancers with an estimated frequency of 40% to 70% in papillary tumors.9,10
In colorectal cancer, the prevalence of BRAF mutations
was lower (range, 5%-20%) but still represented an
important subset of this common cancer.11,12 Other
cancers in which BRAF mutations have been described at
a frequency >5% include ovarian cancer (low-grade
serous tumors), cholangiocarcinoma, prostate cancer, and
cisplatin-refractory germ cell tumors.13-16 BRAF mutations have been observed in a small subset (<5%) of
glioblastomas, nonsmall cell lung cancers, head and neck
squamous cell cancers, breast cancers, and pancreatic
cancers1,6,17-19 (Table 2).
It is noteworthy that BRAF mutations are more
common in certain clinical and pathologic subsets of
melanoma, thyroid cancers, and colon cancers. There is a
strong inverse correlation between age and the likelihood
of BRAF mutation in melanoma, whereas there is a direct
relations between age and the probability of mutation in
thyroid cancer.20,21 In patients with melanoma, BRAF
mutations largely are restricted to lesions that arise
from intermittently sun-exposed skin on the trunk and
extremities.22 Conversely, melanomas that arise from
chronically sun-exposed skin or in sites that apparently are
unrelated to sun exposure (mucosal and acral-lentiginous)
have a low frequency of BRAF mutations. BRAF mutations are reported only in papillary and anaplastic thyroid
cancers, and the latter group appears share molecular
features with more differentiated papillary tumors,
suggesting that these are the poorly differentiated
outgrowth of papillary cancers.9 Colon cancers that arise
in the ascending colon are significantly more likely to

4903

Review Article

harbor BRAF mutation than colon cancers in other
locations and are associated with a worse prognosis.23 In
thyroid cancer, BRAF mutations are associated with more
advanced stage and confer a poor prognosis.9 In addition,
BRAF mutations are enriched in certain molecularly
defined subsets of some cancers, such as basal-type breast
cancer and microsatellite instability-associated colon
cancer.12,24
Preclinical Evidence for BRAF as a
Therapeutic Target in Melanoma
The Sanger Institute group described 4 BRAF mutations,
including V600E, that were capable of causing RAS-independent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) (MAPK; downstream of RAF), MEK-dependent
cell proliferation, and transformation of fibroblasts.1 Subsequent investigations demonstrated that the depletion of
V600E BRAF messenger RNA with BRAF-specific shortinterfering RNA (siRNA) sequences decreased ERK activation, inhibited DNA synthesis, and induced apoptosis;
whereas the depletion of a-Raf or RAF1 messenger RNA
(mRNA) had no such effects.25,26 Furthermore, the depletion of BRAF mRNA in melanoma cell lines that lacked a
BRAF mutation had no effect.26,27 These observations
were extended in vivo using stably expressed V600EBRAF
siRNA in human melanoma cells transplanted into
immunocompromised mice, in which siRNA transfected
xenografts grew significantly more slowly than in
controls.27 Together, these data made a compelling case
indicating that BRAF V600E induces a state of ‘‘oncogene
addiction’’ as defined originally by Weinstein et al.28 In
vitro, the set of genes with expression that is altered by the
inhibition of V600EBRAF confirms the critical role that
this gene plays in driving proliferation and inhibiting
differentiation.29
It was determined soon after the discovery of BRAF
mutations that the introduction of V600EBRAF into p16
null melanocytes resulted in transformation and did not
induce senescence.30 However, when a transgenic mouse
was bred with an inducible V600EBRAF mutation and p16
deletion in melanocytes, only nevus-like lesions formed—
not invasive melanoma.31 It was the combination of
BRAF mutation with phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN) deletion that appeared to be permissive of invasive melanoma in animal models.32 Subsequently, a transgenic mouse was generated with conditional V600EBRAF
and PTEN deletion in melanocytes, and invasive and metastatic melanoma developed.33 Although that model still
lacks the genetic complexity of human melanoma, these

4904

data support the hypothesis that BRAF remains a significant driver of proliferation even in the presence of other
‘‘gatekeeper’’ genetic alterations.
A series of genetic and histopathologic studies raised
questions about the relevance of BRAF as a therapeutic
target. BRAF mutations were discovered first in metastatic
tumors; but it was discovered subsequently that a very
high proportion of benign nevi harbored BRAF mutations.34,35 The correlation between BRAF mutation and
ERK phosphorylation in clinical nevi or melanoma specimens was identified as quite weak.36,37 Furthermore, it
was reported that the introduction of V600EBRAF into
melanocytes induced p16-mediated senescence, a putatively irreversible state of cell cycle arrest.38 Although this
latter observation is consistent with the effect of other,
previously described ‘‘strong’’ oncogenes, such as RAS
and the v-myc myelocytomastosis viral oncogene homolog
MYC, it appeared that BRAF mutations were a very early
event in melanocytic proliferation and that compensatory
mechanisms could reverse its activation of the MAP
kinase pathway and its effect on cell proliferation. Nonetheless, the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT becomes activated by mutation very early in the pathogenesis of
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs)39 and yet
remains a key driver of advanced disease.
Genetic Alterations Beyond BRAF
in Melanoma
The neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog
(NRAS), which activates RAF kinases in response to
growth factor receptor activation, is known to harbor activating mutation in 15% to 20% of melanomas.40,41
Because BRAF mutations confer RAS-independent activation of the MAP kinase pathway, it is not surprising that
NRAS and BRAF mutations are mutually exclusive.42,43
There is significant overlap between BRAF mutation and
p16 deletion or mutation in melanoma.44 PTEN mutations and deletions frequently coincide with BRAF mutation.22,42,44 Although PTEN has numerous functions, the
best-described is inactivation of phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)
kinase. Frequently, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene
homolog 3 (AKT3) is activated in melanoma through
amplification or by other genetic events, further highlighting the coincident activation of the PI3 kinase pathway
and activation of BRAF.45,46 Less common genetic alterations, such as cyclin D amplification and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) mutation, also have been identified
in association with BRAF mutation.22,47 Because it is
believed that cyclin D expression and CDK4 activity are

under control of the MAP kinase pathway, finding genetic
alterations concomitant with BRAF was counterintuitive.
However, the implication of this finding is that BRAF
mutations must serve purposes other than just being drivers of cell proliferation, such as cell energy metabolism48
or cell survival.49
Activation of BRAF in Cancers
Other Than Melanoma
Colon cancer mirrors melanoma with regard to several
features of BRAF biology in melanoma. The detection of
BRAF mutations in aberrant crypt foci is analogous to the
presence of BRAF mutations in benign melanocytic
proliferation.50 In premalignant lesions and advanced
cancers, BRAF mutations also are mutually exclusive with
Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)
mutations, which are substantially more common than
BRAF mutations in colon cancer.11 Unlike melanoma,
PI3 kinase mutations are relatively common in colon
cancer and appear to be concomitant with BRAF mutations in the subset of patients in which they are identified.51 This parallels the genetic evidence pointing to
genetic activation of the PI3 kinase pathway in melanoma
through loss of PTEN or activation of AKT3. In papillary
thyroid cancer, BRAF mutations are known to occur in
association with other genetic alterations. Like melanoma,
BRAF and NRAS mutations can be observed but are
mutually exclusive.52 Analogous to melanoma, in which
mutations in the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase are
observed only in BRAF and NRAS wild-type tumors,
mutations RET (a receptor tyrosine kinase family
member) are not observed in BRAF mutant thyroid
cancers.53 One important consideration in the management of patients with colon cancer who receive other
therapies is the mounting evidence that BRAF mutations,
like KRAS mutations, confer resistance to epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy.54
Less is known about the potential role of BRAF and MEK
inhibitors in the treatment of thyroid and colon cancer
than melanoma. However, the potency of BRAF V600E
as an oncogene coupled with the similarity in accompanying genetic changes suggests that BRAF is an attractive
target in colorectal and thyroid cancer.
BRAF Inhibitors

opment first as an inhibitor of RAF155 and is 10-fold less
potent against BRAF and apparently is even less potent
against V600EBRAF. Sorafenib binds preferentially to the
inactive conformation of Raf kinases. It has broad activity
against numerous receptor tyrosine kinases, including
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors. In
vitro, sorafenib inhibits V600EBRAF at nanomolar concentrations but is only cytotoxic to V600EBRAF melanoma
cells at low micromolar concentrations.25 Furthermore, at
these concentrations, wild-type BRAF cells are equally
sensitive; which is not the case for BRAF-targeted siRNA
or selective BRAF inhibitors. In phase 1 trials, doselimiting toxicities included hand-foot syndrome, which
is a class effect of VEGF receptor inhibitor.56 At the
maximum tolerated dose, sorafenib had significant
single-agent activity in renal cell carcinoma, a uniquely
VEGF-driven tumor, but not in melanoma.57,58 Mechanistic investigations have been limited but suggest that
sorafenib does not effectively inhibit BRAF in human
tumors (as measured by ERK activation before and during
treatment), whereas significant changes were noted in
tumor vascular permeability (an established surrogate for
VEGF signaling).59 On the basis of this evidence, it
appeared that sorafenib was unable to exert a sufficient
effect on BRAF to test the value of BRAF as a therapeutic
target in melanoma. Even taking into account the other
signaling effects of sorafenib, this agent was unable to
augment the activity of chemotherapy in randomized
trials in melanoma.60
RAF-265 and XL-281 are the leading examples of
an emerging class of broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors
that have greater potency and improved selectivity for
BRAF compared with sorafenib (Fig. 2).61,62 Notably,
these agents include receptor tyrosine kinases in their
spectrum and are very potent inhibitors of RAF1, which
may be a relevant property for the treatment of NRAS mutant melanomas. It remains to be determined whether the
BRAF potency of these agents will be sufficient to provide
effective BRAF inhibition in patients. RAF-265 continues
to be evaluated in a first-in-human phase 1 trial exclusively among patients with metastatic melanoma. Preliminary results from the XL-281 phase 1 trial have been
presented but provide little insight into the potential role
of this agent in BRAF-mutant cancers, because only a few
patients with melanoma or with papillary thyroid cancer
were included in the dose-escalation portion of the trial.
In the near future, the first glimpse of single-agent activity
will be available for this class of broad-spectrum RAF
inhibitors.

Several highly selective BRAF inhibitors are being
developed, and PLX4032 is the most advanced by far in
clinical studies (Fig. 2).63,64 GSK2118436 is the second
inhibitor in this class to have entered clinically trials and
has a phase 1 trial currently underway (available at: http://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00880321 accessed on
March 1, 2010). PLX4032 was developed with the crystal
structure of V600E-BRAF as the guide, so that inhibitors
could be serially synthesized to interact with unique elements of the kinase domain in its active confirmation.
Consequently, compounds were identified that demonstrated selectivity between highly homologous wild-type
BRAF and RAF1. Furthermore, these agents are among
the most selective kinase inhibitors against any target that
has been developed to date. In isolated kinase assays, it
appears that PLX4032 and its analogues may have some
selectively for V600EBRAF compared with wild-type
BRAF.65 Regardless, siRNA data suggest that inhibiting
mutant and wild-type BRAF together would have significant consequences only in cells that harbor an activating
BRAF mutation. Consistent with this hypothesis,
PLX4032 at low micromolar doses only inhibits the MAP
kinase pathway in the context of a V600EBRAF mutation,

and the fold increase in concentrations required to demonstrate effects in cellular assays compared with isolated
kinase assays are consistent with other validated kinase
inhibitors against other targets. Subsequent effects on proliferation and apoptosis also are restricted entirely to cells
that harbor BRAF mutations. Xenograft experiments also
have demonstrated selective efficacy among BRAF-mutant
tumors.65
Preliminary results from the PLX4032 phase 1 trial
have been reported.64 In that study, 49 of 55 patients
enrolled in the dose-escalation portion of the study had
metastatic melanoma, and the other patients had papillary
thyroid, colon, ovarian, and germ cell tumors, all of which
can harbor BRAF mutations. Furthermore, there was
enrichment for patients with V600EBRAF mutations,
because many patients’ tumors were evaluated prospectively before study entry, particularly at the higher dose
levels. Rash, fatigue, and arthralgia were observed frequently at the highest doses but generally were mild to
moderate in severity. At the 5 highest dose levels evaluated, 21 patients with melanoma were enrolled along
with 3 patients who had papillary thyroid cancer. Sixteen
of the 21 patients with melanoma had V600EBRAF mutations as did the 3 patients with thyroid cancer. Among the
16 patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, tumor regression was observed in 14, and 9 of 16 patients (56%) had

Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Because follow-up
was very short and most patients still were being treated,
progression-free survival has yet to be well defined. Nonetheless, the preliminary estimate of 6 months is promising
compared with available therapies. Fluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography scans also were performed
at baseline and after 2 weeks of therapy. Significant
changes were observed readily at this early time point.
Selected patients underwent biopsy of superficial tumors
for the purposes of confirming target inhibition. Both
phosphorylation of ERK and expression of Ki67 (as a
marker of proliferation) were inhibited profoundly at
doses near the maximum tolerated dose.66 When possible,
tumor biopsies are being performed at the time of disease
progression to explore the mechanisms of resistance.
MEK Inhibitors
MEK is another key component of the MAP kinase
pathway, but, unlike BRAF, it rarely harbors mutations in
cancer. It is the only known substrate of BRAF, and it is
believed that targeting MEK could be an effective strategy
for cancers in which mutations in BRAF or RAS are identified. CI-1040 was the first-in-class MEK inhibitor and,
like the subsequently developed inhibitors, was an allosteric inhibitor with excellent selectivity for MEK1and
MEK2.67 PD0325901 and AZD6244 are examples of
second-generation MEK inhibitors and were designed to
be more potent against MEK1 and MEK2 but equally
selective.68,69 In vitro, both agents inhibit the proliferation of V600EBRAF melanoma cells and have some activity
against NRAS mutant cells and very little effect on BRAF/
NRAS wild-type cells.68,70 We anticipated that NRAS
mutant and NRAS/BRAF wild-type cancer cells would
depend variously on MEK and ERK signaling, because
RAF1 is capable of interacting with signaling molecules
other than MEK. Even among V600EBRAF melanoma cell
lines, the degree of ERK inhibition in the setting of MEK
inhibition does not correlate very well with the effect of
MEK inhibitors on cell cycle arrest.71 Thus, it is not clear
that ERK activation is the most reliable biomarker of
effective MEK inhibition, although it is the most commonly used in clinical trials. Whereas cell cycle inhibition
commonly is observed, apoptosis infrequently is induced
by these agents. Whether this is a matter of residual MEK
activity even in the face of high drug concentrations or
because V600EBRAF is able to circumvent MEK inhibition
by signaling through another path is unknown.
CI-1040 was evaluated in a phase 1 trial.67 Because

curve relation, there were concerns that the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug would preclude effective
MEK inhibition in patients. However, dose-limiting
asthenia and frequent rash and diarrhea were observed,
and the latter 2 toxicities are now known as typical of
MEK inhibitors. In addition, serial tumor biopsies performed in a significant subset of patients revealed evidence
of target inhibition, including 80% to 90% inhibition of
ERK activation at the highest doses evaluated. Although
this agent did progress to a multicohort phase 2 trial,
patients with melanoma were not included, because BRAF
mutations had not been identified, and a rationale for
including these patients was not evident otherwise. Even
more potent and equally selective MEK inhibitors have
been developed with the hope that they would have superior pharmacokinetic properties and ultimately impact
MEK signaling more profoundly. Both PD0325901 and
AZD6244 have progressed through phase 1 trials.69,72 It
is noteworthy that both drugs inhibit MEK5, the function
of which is poorly understood, in addition to MEK1 and
MEK2. In a phase 1 trial that included extensive investigation of target inhibition in serial tumor biopsies,
PD0325901 indeed proved to be a more potent inhibitor
than CI-1040. Target inhibition >90% was observed
even among patients who received doses well below the
maximum tolerated dose. Because that trial was conducted in the years after BRAF mutations were identified,
the majority of patients who were recruited had metastatic
melanoma. Although the mutation status of many of the
patients with melanoma was not reported, 1 patient who
had a V600EBRAF mutation and 1 who had an NRAS
mutation demonstrated objective responses. This established proof-of-concept that this approach could work in
patients; however, the activity of this agent was never fully
defined in BRAF mutant melanoma, because toxicities
early in the course of phase 2 testing led to the termination
of its development.
In the AZD6244 phase 1 trial, BRAF mutantbearing cancers, such as melanoma, were not enriched,
and an analysis of tumor biopsies for confirmation of
MEK inhibition was not included. The maximum tolerated dose was defined by the same episodes of rash and
diarrhea that were observed with CI-1040 and PD325901.
A large, randomized phase 2 trial was undertaken with
AZD6244 as a single-agent compared with temozolomide
among patients with metastatic melanoma.8 Two hundred
patients were divided evenly between the 2 cohorts. Patients
were not selected on the basis of BRAF or NRAS mutation,
but 146 patients had those genes analyzed for mutation in

4907

Review Article

their tumors retrospectively. Fifty percent of those who
were analyzed had a BRAF mutation, and an additional
18% had an NRAS mutation. On the AZD6244 arm, 6
objective responses were observed, 5 of which were among
patients with BRAF mutations. This translated into a 12%
objective response rate among the BRAF mutant cohort.
However, responses were equally likely with temozolomide
in this group, and progression-free survival was not
improved in a comparison with temozolomide. Again,
proof-of-concept was established in that single-agent MEK
inhibition appeared capable of producing objective
evidence of efficacy. However, the relatively low rate of
response did not support this strategy as clearly superior to
available therapies.
Taken together, the data obtained from the phase 2
studies of AZD6244 and PD0325901, compared with
the early results from PLX4032, raise some very important questions regarding the optimal approach to target
melanomas with activation of the RAS/RAF/ERK
pathway. First, are there critical substrates of BRAF
required for its oncogenic capacity other than MEK? If so,
then these maybe very important for acquired resistance
(see below). Second, is potency of a therapeutic agent and
the extent of inhibition of its targets kinase activity at the
maximum tolerated dose critical? Perhaps PLX4032 is a
more potent inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation than
AZD6244 or PD0325901, and the relation between dose
and pharmacodynamic effects is critical in determining
response. Further clinical studies using quantitative
analyses of signaling in melanoma tissue should provide
insight into these important questions.
Resistance Mechanisms Under Investigation
for BRAF and MEK Inhibition
Clinical development of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is at
an early stage, leaving mechanisms of resistance poorly
understood. The precedents of other targeted therapies in
other cancers shape the expectation of how BRAF mutant
cancers will adapt to chronic inhibition of the MAP kinase
pathway.
Resistance can be considered as either primary or
secondary. Primary resistance defines those tumors that
progress early in the course of therapy, whereas secondary
resistance connotes progression after an initial response.
Although it is possible that similar mechanisms underlie
each in the setting of BRAF mutation, it is reasonable to
anticipate different drivers of resistance in each type. The
simplest explanation for primary resistance to BRAF or
MEK inhibition is incomplete target inhibition. Although

4908

PLX4032 has been investigated with the objective of
defining a conventional maximum tolerated dose, such a
dose has been determined only for continuous, twice-daily
dosing. It remains possible that more complete target
inhibition could be achieved by administering this agent
at higher doses at which tolerability constraints would
require treatment interruption. Giving pulses of highdose therapy has been explored recently in preclinical
models and, to a very limited degree, as a strategy for
improving upon abl inhibition in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or EGFR inhibition in nonsmall cell lung
cancer.73,74 In both cases, there is evidence that significantly greater induction of apoptosis can be achieved with
this approach. Variations in schedule, including pulse
therapy, should not be overlooked in the development of
BRAF or MEK inhibitors based on the evidence in these
other settings.
The underlying genetic complexity of BRAF mutant
melanoma has been characterized sufficiently well to
predict that there are other signal-transduction pathways
that are activated or inactivated concomitantly with the
MAP kinase pathway and that these pathways would
support cell survival in the face of potent BRAF or MEK
inhibition. The PI3 kinase pathway is known to be activated in a significant percentage of BRAF mutant tumors
and represents 1 candidate for mediating resistance.75
Experimental evidence suggesting synergy between MAP
kinase and PI3 kinase pathway inhibition in BRAF
mutant cancers supports this hypothesis.76 Inactivity of
p53, even in the absence of mutation, is another potential,
pre-existing state in melanoma with or without BRAF
mutations and could eliminate the ability of BRAF inhibition to induce cell death that might require p53 function.
It is believed that p16 loss is a critical element of p53 loss
of function and could mediate primary resistance.
Currently, direct experimental evidence in support of this
is lacking.
Two examples of successful therapy targeting oncogenes provide examples of how secondary resistance can
develop through alteration of the target oncogene. In the
case of CML, the target oncogene is the c-abl oncogene 1
receptor tyrosine kinase (ABL kinase). ABL is activated in
CML by translocation of the breakpoint cluster region
(BCR) promoter to the abl kinase gene. Activating mutations in the kinase domain are not identified in the treatment-naive setting in the vast majority of cells. However,
in the face of therapy with potent ABL kinase inhibitors,
such as imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, secondary
resistance has been characterized commonly by the

emergence of new mutations in ABL kinase that permit
continued kinase activity in the face of the respective
drug.73 It is noteworthy that the available ABL kinase
inhibitors are sufficiently different that 1 agent can be
effective in the second-line setting in the face of a
resistance mutation emerging in the presence of front-line
therapy. In GISTs, activating mutations in the kinase
domain of KIT define the target population for imatinib
therapy. Among patients who initially respond to therapy
but later progress, new mutations in KIT have been
identified that facilitate constitutive activity of the kinase
domain that is insensitive to imatinib.77 It is worth noting
that some of these mutations also can be identified de
novo in GISTs and confer primary resistance. Sunitinib,
another potent KIT inhibitor, has proven efficacy in this
setting and has demonstrated potency in vitro against
several of these imatinib-resistant mutations.78 Both of
these examples point to BRAF itself, or possibly even MEK,
as the entity to study with regard to new mutations.
EGFR mutant nonsmall lung cancer offers a unique
example of a targeted therapy resistance mechanism. In
some tumors that initially were responsive to an EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, at the time resistance
manifested, new amplification of the MET receptor allele
was identified and may have restored EGFR-driven
aberrancy in signal transduction.79 A similar change in the
lymph node from which signal transduction begins could
be investigated in BRAF mutant cancer first by characterizing MAP kinase pathway activation at the time of
progression and copy number for RAF1 and MEK, the
2 known substrates for V600EBRAF. There is evidence
that activation of RAF1 is a defining element of BRAF
inhibitor-resistant cell lines in vitro.80 If alterations are
not identified there, then farther downstream elements in
the MAP kinase pathway would be considered, such as
ERK and cyclin D. Another possibility is reduced activity
or expression of inhibitory phosphatases, such as members
of the dual-specificity phosphatase families, which
recently were associated with down-regulation of phosphorylation and activity of ERK.81 Investigations of novel
gene products that could regulate MAP kinase pathway
activity and serve as possible drivers of resistance likely
would require a more broad-based method of characterizing genomic alterations and changes in gene expression.
Constructing Combination Therapy Regimens
With BRAF or MEK Targeting
There are numerous possibilities to consider to improve
upon single-agent BRAF or MEK inhibition in the setting

Cancer

of BRAF mutation. To date, response duration has been
measured in months, and complete responses have not
been observed. The next clinical goal is to identify rational
second-line therapies to follow BRAF inhibition, improve
the longevity of initial response, or obtain complete
responses. It is critical to recognize that the greatest
improvement in clinical outcome might come from
sequential targeted therapy using agents that intercept the
mediators of secondary resistance. This reportedly was
advantageous in preclinical studies in CML and
GIST.82,83 Combination strategies also should be considered and can be divided into 2 categories: 1) the pursuit of
oncogenes/oncogenic pathways that may cooperate with
BRAF and 2) targeting the mediators of downstream
effector pathways that contribute to the malignant
phenotype.
If new BRAF mutations are identified at the time of
resistance to initial therapy, then the most rational initial
approach to the treatment of resistant disease would
be the sequential administration of BRAF inhibitors
with second-line and third-line agents that are capable of
inhibiting the resistance mutations that arise in the face of
initial BRAF inhibition. BRAF inhibitors with potency
against RAF1, such as RAF-265 and XL-281, would
provide an opportunity to maintain BRAF inhibition and
potentially intercept the up-regulation of RAF1. If reactivation of ERK signaling that depends on MEK is a fundamental mechanism of resistance, then investigating MEK
inhibitors as single-agent salvage therapy or in a first-line
combination with BRAF inhibition would have strong
rationale. Similarly, the development of selective inhibitors of ERK also could be considered.
If unique signal-transduction pathways are the
determinants of resistance, then targeting them in
conjunction with BRAF inhibition would be justified.
Currently, as mentioned above, there is evidence that the
PI3 kinase pathway cooperates with BRAF in melanoma
formation and contributes to primary resistance of BRAF
mutant cancers. A challenge in BRAF mutant melanoma
is identifying the appropriate point of intervention in the
PI3 kinase pathway. The most common genetic cause of
PI3 kinase pathway activation, PTEN loss, does not
distinguish between PI3 kinase, AKT, or mammalian
target of Rapamycin as more or less attractive targets.
Inhibitors of each are in clinical development and, thus,
potentially are available for preclinical and early clinical
studies to explore safety and efficacy. AKT3 has been
proposed as a potentially unique oncogene in melanoma
and would be an attractive partner target for combination

4909

Review Article

with BRAF inhibition, but isoform-selective AKT inhibitors have not been introduced clinically.84 In colon
cancer, PI3 kinase mutations are common and have been
associated with BRAF mutation. In this case, there is a
clear rationale for combining selective inhibitors of each
kinase. The genetic alterations in p16, cyclin D, and
CDK4 that are identified commonly in melanoma
point to that signaling complex as a potential target for
combination therapy, and preclinical evidence supports
this strategy in BRAF mutant melanoma.85 Currently, the
only drug strategy that exists to target these cell cycle regulators is CDK4 inhibition. Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent
kinases, with some selectivity for CDK4, are in clinical
development.86
A distinct strategy would be to develop combination
regimens that combine BRAF inhibitors with targets that
are not oncogenes themselves, such as regulators of
apoptosis, angiogenesis, and escape of immune surveillance. It is known that BRAF inhibition itself alters the
balance of proapoptotic factors.87 Thus, specifically
targeting inhibitors of apoptosis with Bcl-2 homology
domain 3 (BH3) mimetics or inhibitor of apoptosis
protein inhibitors could push cancer cells farther toward
apoptosis than what can be achieved with BRAF inhibition alone. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the
production of proangiogenic cytokines, such as VEGF
and interleukin-8, is under the control of mutant
BRAF.88 Combining a BRAF or MEK inhibitor with
agents that target VEGF signaling, for example, could
provide more effective angiogenesis inhibition in the
setting of BRAF mutation. It has even been observed that
the down-regulation of histocompatibility antigens occurs
as a consequence of BRAF mutations; thus, effective
BRAF inhibition could create a more favorable milieu for
antitumor immune recognition.89 In this setting, the
addition of agents that promote dendritic cell antigen
presentation or that stimulate effecter T cells would be
worthy of exploration.
In conclusion, BRAF represents an important target
in cancer, in part because of its presence in 7% of all
cancers but also because it represents the first intracellular
signaling molecule activated by point mutations for which
single-agent therapy appears to have efficacy. Melanoma
has been the disease context in which the most extensive
clinical evaluations have been conducted with RAF and
MEK inhibitors. Although melanoma is the cancer with
the highest percentage of BRAF mutations, it may or may
not represent the most responsive. The lack of effective
treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma

4910

permits the rapid clinical evaluation of new agents as
monotherapy, which offers the advantage of being able to
study response and predictive biomarkers without the
influence of other therapies. Melanoma is an aggressive
tumor, and it is associated with a large array of genetic
alterations beyond just point mutations in BRAF. It seems
reasonable to anticipate that some tumors will be more or
less sensitive to treatment based on the constellation of
other genetic changes, and these will be defined as predictive markers. Understanding the network of signaltransduction pathways and how that network may adapt
to BRAF or MEK inhibition will point to the next generation of clinical trials investigating rational combination
regimens. The current investigations in melanoma will
create a set of hypothesis to be tested in each cancer that
harbors BRAF mutations.
