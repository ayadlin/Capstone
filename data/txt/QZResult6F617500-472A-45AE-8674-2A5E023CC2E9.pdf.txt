Full-Length Semaphorin-3C Is an Inhibitor of
Tumor Lymphangiogenesis and Metastasis
Yelena Mumblat, Ofra Kessler, Neta Ilan, and Gera Neufeld

Abstract
Semaphorins play important regulatory roles in diverse processes such as axon guidance, angiogenesis, and immune
responses. We ﬁnd that semaphorin-3C (sema3C) induces the
collapse of the cytoskeleton of lymphatic endothelial cells
(LEC) in a neuropilin-2-, plexin-D1-, and plexin-A1–dependent
manner, while most other semaphorins, including antiangiogenic semaphorins such as sema3A do not. Sema3C is cleaved,
like other class-3 semaphorins, by furin-like pro-protein convertases (FPPC). Cleaved sema3C (p65-Sema3C) was unable to
induce the collapse of the cytoskeleton of LEC. FPPC are
strongly upregulated in tumor cells. In order to examine the
effects of full-length sema3C on tumor progression, we therefore generated an active point mutated furin cleavage-resistant
sema3C (FR-sema3C). FR-sema3C inhibited potently proliferation of LEC and to a lesser extent proliferation of human

umbilical vein–derived endothelial cells. FR-sema3C also inhibited VEGF-C–induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-3, ERK1/2,
and AKT. Expression of recombinant FR-sema3C in metastatic,
triple-negative LM2-4 breast cancer cells did not affect their
migration or proliferation in vitro. However, tumors derived
from FR-sema3C–expressing LM2-4 cells implanted in mammary fat pads developed at a slower rate, contained a lower
concentration of blood vessels and lymph vessels, and metastasized much less effectively to lymph nodes. Interestingly, p65Sema3C, but not FR-sema3C, rendered A549 lung cancer cells
resistant to serum deprivation, suggesting that previously
reported protumorigenic activities of sema3C may be due to
p65-Sema3C produced by tumor cells. Our observations suggest that FR-sema3C may be further developed into a novel
antitumorigenic drug. Cancer Res; 75(11); 2177–86. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

to one of the two receptors of the neuropilin family, which
subsequently associates with type-A plexin receptors or with
plexin-D1 to transduce signals (10, 11). The identiﬁcation of
the neuropilins as receptors for the angiogenic factor VEGF
(12–14) suggested that class-3 semaphorins also regulate
angiogenesis. Indeed, sema3A, sema3B, sema3E, and sema3F
have been identiﬁed as inhibitors of angiogenesis, and consequently as inhibitors of tumor development (15). Class-3
semaphorins can inhibit angiogenesis by competition with
angiogenic factors for binding to shared receptors, such as
neuropilins, as well as by the activation of inhibitory signaling
cascades that inhibit signal transduction induced by angiogenic
factors (16–18).
Lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) express the neuropilin-2
receptor (19) and proliferate in response to VEGF-C and VEGFD that signal using the VEGFR-3 receptor (20). VEGFR-3 forms
complexes with neuropilin-2, which is required for the transduction of VEGF-C signals (20, 21). These observations suggest
that class-3 semaphorins that use the neuropilin-2 receptor,
such as sema3F, or sema3G (22, 23) may inhibit lymphangiogenesis. Indeed, sema3F was reported to repel LEC and to
inhibit metastasis of melanoma cells to lymph nodes, although
inhibition of tumor lymphangiogenesis was not demonstrated
and it is thus uncertain whether the inhibition of lymph node
metastasis observed was indeed due to inhibition of lymphangiogenesis (24).
We ﬁnd that of the class-3 semaphorins only sema3F and
semaphorin-3C (sema3C) induce the collapse of the cytoskeleton of LEC. We show that sema3C inhibits VEGF-C–induced
signal transduction, and strongly inhibits the proliferation of
LEC. Furin-like pro-protein convertases (FPPC) cleave sema3C
and are strongly upregulated in tumor cells (25). We show that
ectopic expression of a furin cleavage-resistant point mutated

Tumor metastasis to lymph nodes represents the ﬁrst step of
dissemination in head and neck tumors and in breast cancer
tumors, and is a major prognostic indicator for disease progression (1–4). From there, tumor cells can then enter the vascular
circulation via the thoracic lymphatic duct (3). The metastatic
spread of tumor cells to lymph nodes is enhanced following the
induction of tumor lymphangiogenesis, which is driven by lymphangiogenic factors such as VEGF-C and VEGF-D (5–7). The
metastatic spread of tumor cells to lymph nodes can also be
enhanced by cytokines such as CCL21, CXC12 (SDF-1), and CCL1
that recruit tumor cells to lymph vessels (4). VEGF-D was also
found to promote the dilation of collecting lymphatics by upregulation of prostaglandin production, thereby promoting the
passage of tumor cells to lymph nodes (8).
The class-3 semaphorins were initially characterized as axon
guidance factors (9). Class-3 semaphorins, with the exception
of sema3E, which binds directly to the plexin-D1 receptor, bind

sema3C (FR-sema3C) in tumors derived from LM2-4 breast
cancer cells implanted in mammary fat pads inhibits tumor
lymphangiogenesis and the metastatic spread of tumor cells to
lymph nodes. Finally, we show that the major FPPC cleaved
form of sema3C, p65-Sema3C, but not FR-sema3C, promotes
the survival of neuropilin-2–expressing tumor cells. This observation may explain why sema3C was previously described as a
protumorigenic factor.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Human umbilical vein–derived endothelial cells (HUVEC)
were isolated and cultured as previously described (26). Neonatal
human lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells (LEC) were
purchased from Lonza (cat. no. CC-2812) and cultured in medium supplied by the vendor (cat. no. CC-3162). LM2-4 cells were
kindly provided by Dr. Robert Kerbel (Biological Sciences Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada;
ref. 27). HEK293, U87MG, and A549 cells were purchased from
the ATCC. HEK293-FT were purchased from Invitrogen. These cell
lines were cultured as described previously (27–29).
Antibodies and reagents
Di-Asp was from Molecular Probes. Heparin Sepharose CL-6B
from GE Healthcare. Recombinant ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 was
produced as described previously (30). VEGF-C was from Peprotech. The expression plasmid encoding the extracellular domain
of the sema6A cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Behar (Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel). The various lentiviral
shRNA expression vectors were purchased from Sigma. A detailed
list of the antibodies that were used can be found in the Supplementary Data.
Production of sema3C variants
The human sema3C cDNA was purchased from DharmaconGE Life Sciences. The construction of the cDNAs encoding FRsema3C and the other sema3C-derived variants and of the lentiviral expression vectors, as well as the plasmids used, is described
in detail in the Supplementary Methods. Conditioned media
containing the various sema3C variants and the additional semaphorins were collected from HEK293 cells expressing the recombinant semaphorins as previously described (28, 29, 31).
Puriﬁcation of FR-sema3C/Fc and p65-Sema3C/Fc
HEK293 cells expressing FR-sema3C/Fc or p65-Sema3C/Fc
were incubated for 24 hours in serum-free medium. Conditioned
medium was loaded on a protein-A column at 4 C. The beads
were washed with 20 mmol/L Tris pH-8 containing 150 mmol/L
NaCl and eluted with 100 mmol/L glycine pH-3, which was
immediately neutralized with Tris base (1 mol/L).
Cytoskeletal contraction assay
Cytoskeletal contraction of cells in response to semaphorins
was performed as previously described (28). Quantitative cell
contraction was performed as described in the Supplementary
Methods.
Repulsion assay
Cell repulsion assays were performed as described previously
(28).

2178 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

Proliferation assays
HUVEC (2  104 cells/well) or LEC (4  104 cells/well) were
seeded in LEC medium in the presence or absence of semaphorins
(1 mg/mL). The number of adherent cells was determined after 3
days using either the WST-1 kit according to the vendor instructions using a coulter-counter as previously described (29).
Migration assay
Migration assays were performed using the xCELLigence
machine. Cells were seeded in ﬁbronectin-coated wells of CIMplate 16 dishes (3  104 cells/well). Cells that passed through the
membrane were then quantiﬁed according to the instructions of
the vendor.
Phosphorylation assays
The phosphorylation assays were performed as described in the
Supplementary Methods.
Tumor formation assays
Tomato-red RFP-expressing LM2-4 cells infected with empty
lentiviral vector (control) or with lentiviruses directing expression
of FR-sema3C/myc were washed, suspended in 50 mL of PBS, and
injected into the mammary fat pads of 6- to 7-week-old female
scid/nod mice (2  106 cells/mouse). After 30 days, tumors and
lymph nodes were excised and weighted. All the animal experiments were approved by the Technion ethics committee.
Immunocytochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
Detection of vinculin, actin, CD-31, or podoplanin using
appropriate antibodies or of phalloidin tagged with ﬂuorescent
probes was done as previously described (17). More details are
provided in the Supplementary Methods.
Quantiﬁcation of metastatic load in lymph nodes
Lymph nodes were excised and imaged ex vivo using the IVIS200 imaging system or the Maestro in vivo imaging system. The
normalized photon density (photon/s/cm2/sr) emitted from
tomato-red RFP-labeled LM2-4 cells was then quantiﬁed. Sections
from lymph nodes were stained with an anti-HLA antibody to
detect metastases and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Heparin-sepharose afﬁnity chromatography
Heparin-sepharose afﬁnity chromatography was done as
described previously (32).
Statistical analysis
A one-tailed unpaired Student t test was used in all the experiments unless otherwise indicated. Cell proliferation and cell
survival experiments were performed in triplicates and the variation between triplicates did not exceed 10%. Error bars represent
the standard error of the mean. Statistical P values are indicated. In
cases in which the P value was smaller than 0.001 three asterisks
are depicted. All experiments were repeated independently at least
three times unless otherwise stated.
Ethics statement
All the authors of this article have given their informed consent
to the article. The animal studies were all conducted according to
the NIH guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the Technion.

Results
Sema3F and sema3C induce the collapse of the cytoskeleton of
LEC
We screened the class-3 semaphorins for their ability to induce
the collapse of the cytoskeleton of cultured LEC characterized by
the expression of podoplanin (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The only
semaphorins that induced the collapse of the LEC cytoskeleton
were sema3C and sema3F (Fig. 1A). All the other semaphorins we
tested were active and induced the cytoskeletal collapse of other
cell types (Supplementary Fig. S2) but, nevertheless, did not
induce cytoskeletal collapse in LEC. Contrary to our expectations,
sema3G, a class-3 semaphorin that signals using the neuropilin-2
receptor (23), failed to induce cytoskeletal collapse of LEC (Fig.
1A). Sema3C also induced the collapse of the cytoskeleton of
HUVEC (Fig. 1B) and in repulsion assays cells expressing recombinant sema3C repulsed both HUVEC and LEC (Fig. 1C). Unlike
HUVEC, which express both neuropilins, LEC expressed, as
expected, much more neuropilin-2 (Supplementary Fig. S1B;
ref. 19). The expression patterns of the type-A plexins were similar
between HUVEC [and other primary human endothelial cell types
(Supplementary Fig. S1C)] and LEC except that plexin-A4 was not
expressed at all in LEC, and plexins A1 and D1 seemed to be more
abundant in LEC (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Class-3 semaphorins are susceptible to cleavage by proteases of
the FPPC family (28, 33). In the case of sema3C, cleavage by FPPC
results in the generation of a 65-kDa peptide (p65-Sema3C)
containing the N-terminal of sema3C up to the ﬁrst FPPC cleavage

site (Fig. 2A, site 1). Malignant cells upregulate production of
FPPCs (25). Sema3C was efﬁciently cleaved when it was expressed
in HEK293 cells or in several other types of tumor cells, including
LM2-4 breast cancer cells (Fig. 2B and C). We produced and
puriﬁed a fusion protein in which p65-Sema3C is fused in frame
to Fc or myc epitope tags at its C-terminal (Fig. 2A). However, p65Sema3C/Fc failed to induce contraction of LEC, and we therefore
assumed that p65-Sema3C is inactive (Fig. 2E).
Generation of an active point mutated sema3C (FR-sema3C)
that resists cleavage by FPPC
To study the effects of full-length sema3C on tumor progression, we generated a point mutated sema3C that resists cleavage
by FPPC. The arginines of FPPC cleavage site-1 were replaced with
lysine residues and the part of the basic domain that contains the
ADAMTS1 cleavage site (34) and the second FPPC cleavage site
was deleted. Fc or myc epitope tags were then fused in frame
upstream to a stop codon to generate FR-sema3C/Fc and FRsema3C/myc (Fig. 2A). In contrast with sema3C, FR-sema3C/Fc
remained mostly intact when expressed in HEK293 cells or in
LM2-4 cells (Figs. 2B–2D and 4A). Puriﬁed FR-sema3C/Fc
induced contraction of LEC (Fig. 2E) while a puriﬁed FPPCresistant point mutated form of sema3E (UNCL-sema3E/Fc;
ref. 35) failed to induce contraction of LEC (Fig. 2E). FRsema3C/Fc also induced the contraction of HUVEC while p65Sema3C/Fc did not (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
Sema3C binds to the extracellular matrix and can be released
from it by heparin and by digestion with ADAMTS1 (Fig. 2A;
ref. 34). These observations suggest that sema3C is a heparainbinding protein and that binding to heparin or heparan sulfates
may be important to its activity. Indeed, sema3C binds to heparinsepharose and is released from it with 0.5 mol/L NaCl (Fig. 2F).

Characterization of FR-sema3C. A, the location of the two FPPC cleavage sites, the point mutation introduced into the ﬁrst FPPC site, and the structure of
the various sema3C deletion mutants are depicted. Fc or myc epitope tags were fused in frame upstream of the stop codon. B, samples of conditioned medium
from HEK293 cells expressing sema3C/Fc, FR-sema3C-Fc, or conditioned medium from control cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis using an antibody
directed against the N-terminal of sema3C. C, the conditioned medium samples described under B were probed with antibodies directed against the Fc tag. D, an
aliquot (10 mL) of FR-Sema3C/Fc puriﬁed from conditioned medium using protein-A sepharose was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie
Brilliant Blue. E, LEC were seeded on cover slips in 12-well dishes. After 24 hours, the cells were stimulated with vehicle (control) or with puriﬁed FR-sema3C-Fc
(1 mg/mL), p65-sema3C/Fc (1 mg/mL), or UNCL-Sema3E/Fc (35; 1 mg/mL). After 40 minutes at 37 C, the cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
stained with an antibody against vinculin (red) and with phalloidin (green; magniﬁcation, 40). Arrows, vinculin stained focal contacts. F, medium conditioned
for 48 hours by U87MG cells expressing sema3C/myc, sema3C-noBD/myc, or p65-sema3C/Fc/myc was adsorbed to heparin-sepharose at 4 C followed by
elution with increasing NaCl concentrations. The conditioned mediums (CM), ﬂow through (FT), and eluted fractions were then subjected to Western blot analysis
using anti-myc antibodies.

Interestingly, sema3C lacking the basic domain and the
ADAMTS1 site still binds to heparin and is active while p65Sema3C loses the heparin-binding ability (Fig. 2F).
FR-sema3C/Fc inhibits the proliferation of LEC and VEGF-C–
induced signaling
FR-sema3C/Fc inhibited strongly the proliferation of LEC (Fig.
3A and B; Supplementary Movies S3 and S4) and the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into the cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). The LEC eventually died (Supplementary
Movies S3 and S4) but we could not detect in these cells enhanced
expression of activated caspase-3 (data not shown). In contrast,
the proliferation of HUVEC was inhibited very moderately (by
25%), and was not accompanied by cell death (Fig. 3A and B;
Supplementary Movies S1 and S2).

2180 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

VEGF-C promotes the proliferation of LEC as well as lymphangiogenesis (36, 37). We therefore determined whether FRsema3C/Fc affects VEGF-C–induced signaling in LEC. Stimulation by FR-sema3C/Fc inhibited VEGF-C–induced phosphorylation of the VEGFR-3 receptor (Tyr-1230/1231), and also VEGF-C–
induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT (Fig. 3C). These
results suggest that FR-sema3C may inhibit the proliferation of
LEC by inhibition of VEGF-C signaling and that FR-sema3C may
compete with VEGF-C for binding to the VEGF-C coreceptor
neuropilin-2 (21). To determine the relative contribution of the
different neuropilins and plexins to FR-sema3C signal transduction in LEC, we silenced the expression of these receptors
(Supplementary Fig. S3A) and determined how the silencing
affects FR-sema3C/Fc–induced cell contraction using the xCELLigence machine as shown (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The

FR-sema3C inhibits LEC proliferation and VEGF-C–induced signal transduction. A, HUVEC or LEC were seeded in 12-well dishes (2  10 and 5  10
cells/well, respectively) in LEC growth medium in the presence of vehicle (control) or FR-sema3C/Fc (2 mg/mL). Cells were photographed after 72 hours. B, LEC and
HUVEC were seeded in ﬁbronectin-coated 96-well dishes and the effect of FR-sema3C/Fc (2 mg/mL) on their proliferation was measured using the WST-1
proliferation assay as described. Shown is the average of N independent experiments. C, conﬂuent 6-well dishes containing LEC were incubated with vehicle
or FR-sema3C-Fc and stimulated with VEGF-C as described. Cell extracts were then subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against
phosphorylated VEGFR-3, phosphorylated-ERK1/2, and phosphorylated AKT as described. The blots were then stripped and reprobed with antibodies against
VEGFR-3, ERK1/2, and AKT. Shown is a representative experiment out of several that were performed with similar results. D, LEC silenced for the expression
4
of the indicated receptors or control cells expressing a nontargeting shRNA (sh-control) were seeded in wells of the xCELLigence machine (2  10 cells/well)
and cultured for 24 hours as described. They were subsequently stimulated with FR-sema3C/Fc (1 mg/mL). Cell contraction over time was then measured.
Maximal contraction was determined as described in Supplementary Fig. S3B. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA.    , P < 0.001.

FR-sema3C/Fc–induced collapse of the actin cytoskeleton of the
LEC was inhibited in LEC silenced for neuropilin-2 (P < 0.001),
plexin-D1 (P < 0.001), or plexin-A1 (P < 0.001) expression
although silencing plexin-A1 inhibited cell contraction somewhat
less potently (Fig. 3D).
FR-sema3C does not affect the proliferation or migration of
LM2-4 breast cancer cells but strongly inhibits metastasis to
lymph nodes from tumors derived from these cells
LM2-4 breast cancer cells were derived from triple-negative
MDA-MB-231 cells by repeated isolation of metastasized cells
from lungs (27). We expressed in them recombinant tomato-red
RFP and in addition either empty expression vector (control) or
FR-sema3C/myc. Conditioned medium from these cells contained almost exclusively full-length FR-sema3C/myc (Fig. 4A).
FR-sema3C/myc induced the contraction of HUVEC and LEC (Fig.

www.aacrjournals.org

4B) but failed to induce contraction of LM2-4 cells (Fig. 4B) nor
did expression of FR-sema3C/myc in these cells inhibit their
proliferation or migration (Fig. 4C and D). LM2-4 cells express
very little neuropilin-2, which may explain why they do not
respond to FR-sema3C/Fc (Supplementary Fig. S7B).
We have implanted both control LM2-4 cells and LM2-4
expressing FR-sema3C/myc in mammary fat pads of scid/nod
mice. The implanted control and FR-sema3C–expressing cells also
expressed in addition tomato-red RFP. FR-sema3C/myc was
expressed intact in these tumors and was not cleaved (Fig. 5A).
Although the expression of FR-sema3C/myc in the LM2-4 cells did
not change their behavior in vitro, it inhibited signiﬁcantly (P ¼
0.002) by about 30% the development of tumors from these cells
following their implantation in the mammary fat pads (Fig. 5B).
The concentration of lymph vessels in the tumors that developed
from the FR-sema3C/myc–expressing cells was signiﬁcantly lower

FR-sema3C/myc inhibits tumor lymphangiogenesis. It was
reported that intratumoral lymph vessels do not contribute to
tumor metastasis (38). We therefore determined whether FRsema3C reduces preferentially the concentration of peripheral
lymph vessels in a peripheral band with a thickness of about 10%
of the average diameter of the tumor (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
The concentration of the lymph vessels in the internal parts of
the tumors was about half their concentration in this peripheral
band in the control tumors as well as in tumors derived from FRsema3C–expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Expression of
FR-sema3C reduced the concentration of the lymph vessels by
30% in the periphery and by 45% in the internal parts of the
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5B). These changes did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance, possibly because we analyzed only a limited subset of the tumors, but the trend was clear. In addition,
tumors derived from FR-sema3C/myc–expressing LM2-4 cells
contained about half the concentration of blood vessels (P ¼
0.05) as revealed by staining tumor sections for CD31 (Fig. 5E
and F) and by determination of the concentration of CD31positive cells in the tumors by FACS analysis (P ¼ 0.018; Supplementary Fig. S3C). Thus, FR-sema3C also functions as an
inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis, which may explain why these
tumors were smaller. We also determined in one experiment the
concentration of tumor-associated M1 and M2 macrophages

excised tumors. These experiments indicate that the concentration
of the F4-80þ/CD206þ M2 macrophage subpopulation is significantly reduced by about 50% in the FR-sema3C/myc-expressing
tumors (P ¼ 0.048) while the concentration of F4-80þ/CD11-bþ
M1 subpopulation was not altered (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
We have excised the proper axillary, lumbar aortic, and subiliac
lymph nodes from mice harboring tumors derived from control
and FR-sema3C/myc-expressing LM2-4 cells. Metastases in
excised lymph nodes were identiﬁed and their mass measured
using the IVIS-200 imaging system (Fig. 6A) or the Maestro system
(Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D). The presence of metastases in
lymph nodes was also veriﬁed by staining lymph node sections for
human class-1 HLA (Fig. 6B). Although 95% of the mice harboring control tumors developed at least one metastase in lymph
nodes, only 39% of the mice harboring FR-sema3C/myc tumors
had at least one lymph node metastase (Fig. 6C). Although
metastases were detected in 70% of the lymph nodes excised
from mice harboring control tumors, only 19% of the lymph
nodes excised from mice harboring FR-sema3C/myc tumors had
metastases. Furthermore, the average size of metastases found in
lymph nodes of mice harboring FR-sema3C/myc–expressing
tumors was only 13% of the average size of metastases found in
lymph nodes derived from mice harboring control tumors (P <
0.001; Fig. 6D). Tomato-red RFP-labeled tumor cells could easily
be seen in lymph vessels draining into lymph nodes in mice
harboring control tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Notably, at

the time the mice were sacriﬁced, we could not yet detect metastases in the livers or lungs of any of the mice. Taken together, our
results suggest that FR-sema3C inhibits metastasis to lymph
nodes.
To ﬁnd out if metastasis to lymph nodes is inﬂuenced by the
size of the primary tumors, we compared the incidence of lymph
node metastasis in mice that harbored size-matched control or FRsema3C–expressing tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6B). However,
despite the similar size of the primary tumors in these groups,
expression of FR-sema3C/myc still inhibited potently and significantly the development of metastases in lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D). Thus, although we cannot rule out
completely an effect of tumor size on lymph node metastasis, it
seems that most of the effect of FR-sema3C on the metastasis of
tumor cells to lymph nodes is not due to differences in the size of
the primary tumors.
p65-Sema3C functions as a survival-promoting factor
Several reports have characterized sema3C as a protumorigenic
factor (39–41). These studies were conducted using wild-type,
FPPC cleavable sema3C. It is likely that a signiﬁcant portion of the
sema3C found in the tumor microenvironment is present in the
form of p65-Sema3C because malignant cells produce as a rule
highly elevated levels of FPPC (25). We hypothesized that even

www.aacrjournals.org

though p65-Sema3C was not able to affect the cytoskeletal organization of LEC, it may nevertheless display protumorigenic
properties. Indeed, recombinant p65-Sema3C promoted signiﬁcantly the survival of A549 lung cancer cells while FR-sema3C was
completely devoid of such activity (Supplementary Fig. S7A). This
preliminary experiment suggests that the reported protumorigenic effects of sema3C may be due to p65-sema3C–speciﬁc
effects. The mechanism by which p65-Sema3C exerts its survival-enhancing effect and the characterization of the effects of p65Sema3C on tumor progression will need to be examined further in
the future.

Discussion
Metastasis to lymph nodes via the lymphatic system represents
the ﬁrst step of metastatic dissemination in malignant melanomas, squamous carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC), and
breast cancer. In these tumors, the identiﬁcation of lymph node
metastases represents a major prognostic indicator for disease
progression (1–4, 42). Heightened expression of VEGF-C in
breast carcinoma cells was found to induce tumor lymphangiogenesis and to enhance metastasis of tumor cells to lymph nodes
(5, 43), suggesting that inhibitors of lymphangiogenesis may
potentially have a beneﬁcial effect on the progression of breast

FR-sema3C inhibit the spontaneous metastasis of LM2-4 cells to lymph nodes. A, LM2-4 cells expressing tomato-red RFP and either empty vector (control) or a FRSema3C/myc encoding lentiviral vector were implanted in mammary fat pads. The proper axillary, lumbar aortic, and subiliac lymph nodes were excised
after 30 days. The size of metastases in excised lymph nodes was quantiﬁed using the IVIS 200 imaging system. Lymph nodes containing metastases (yellow arrows)
or not (green arrows) are shown. B, a representative histologic section derived from a metastase containing lymph node derived from a mouse harboring a

cancer. Indeed, several inhibitors of lymphangiogenesis targeting
VEGF-C and VEGF-D signaling have been recently examined
(3, 44–46).
We ﬁnd that sema3C is the only class-3 semaphorin besides
sema3F that is able to induce the collapse of the cytoskeleton of
LEC, and hypothesized that sema3C may function as an inhibitor
of lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we
used the highly metastatic LM2-4 breast cancer cells. These cells
did not seem affected in any way directly by sema3C in cell
culture, and metastasized spontaneously very efﬁciently from
primary tumors to lymph nodes, thus enabling the discrimination
between direct effects of sema3C on the tumor cells versus effects
on the tumor microenvironment. However, we could not conduct
this study with native sema3C because FPPC produced in abundance by malignant cells (25) cleaves sema3C, resulting in the
generation of the p65-Sema3C cleavage product, which unlike
full-length sema3C failed to promote the collapse of the cytoskeleton of LEC and seemed inactive. We therefore produced the
point mutated FR-sema3C variant of sema3C, which is resistant to
cleavage by FPPC.

2184 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

FR-sema3C induced the contraction of the cytoskeleton of LEC
and HUVEC. These effects were mediated in the LEC by the
neuropilin-2 receptor and by the D1 and A1 plexin receptors,
which associate with neuropilins to form functional class-3
semaphorin receptors (15). Surprisingly, silencing plexin-A3 had
no effect on FR-sema3C/Fc–induced contraction of LEC. Thus, the
mechanism by which FR-sema3C inhibits lymphangiogenesis
differs from that used by sema3F, the only other class-3 semaphorin that induces in LEC cytoskeletal collapse and that transduces signals using neuropilin-2 and plexin-A3 (47). FR-sema3C
also inhibited the proliferation of LEC, and inhibited in these cells
VEGF-C induced signal transduction. Unlike sema3A and sema3F,
which induce caspase-3–dependent apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells (17), FR-sema3C promoted the death of the LEC by a
caspase-3-independent mechanism. In contrast, FR-sema3C
inhibited much less effectively the proliferation of HUVEC and
did not affect at all the proliferation or the cytoskeletal organization of the LM2-4 cells.
FR-sema3C–expressing LM2-4 cells formed tumors in mammary fat pads of scid/nod mice but their growth was inhibited by

about 30% as compared with the growth rate of control tumors,
possibly because FR-sema3C also functions as an inhibitor of
angiogenesis. Interestingly, we have also observed a reduction in
the concentration of activated M2 macrophages in the FR-sema3C–
expressing tumors. M2 macrophages enhance angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis (48–50) and it is possible that inhibition of
their recruitment by FR-sema3C contributes to the FR-sema3C–
induced inhibition of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.
Tumors derived from FR-sema3C–expressing LM2-4 cells contained a signiﬁcantly reduced concentration of lymph vessels,
suggesting that FR-sema3C inhibits lymphangiogenesis. The
reduction in the concentration of the lymph vessels was a bit
more pronounced in the central regions of the tumors but was
substantial also in the periphery. These observations suggest that
the inhibition of metastasis to lymph nodes by FR-sema3C is
consistent, at least in part, with inhibition of tumor lymphangiogenesis. Both the number of lymph nodes that contained metastases as well as the size of metastases that formed in positive
lymph nodes were signiﬁcantly reduced in mice harboring tumors
derived from FR-sema3C–expressing LM2-4 cells. Similar results
were obtained even when the incidence of metastasis was compared between mice harboring size-matched FR-sema3C expressing tumors and control tumors. Taken together, these results
suggest that FR-sema3C could perhaps be used to inhibit the
metastatic spread of breast cancer tumors to lymph nodes.
In contrast with our observations that suggest that sema3C is an
inhibitor of tumor progression, sema3C expressed in tumors was
reported to function as a protumorigenic factor (39–41). These
observations are reminiscent of the similar protumorigenic activity displayed by p61-sema3E, which is the FPPC cleavage product
of sema3E that gains the ability to activate the ErbB2 receptor and
thus promotes tumor progression. However, unlike p65-sema3C,
p61-sema3E still retained the cytoskeleton collapsing activity of
full-length sema3E (35, 51). We have found preliminary evidence

indicating that p65-Sema3C functions as a survival factor for
A549 lung cancer cells, suggesting that the reported protumorigenic properties of sema3C may be due to p65-Sema3C. The
properties of p65-Sema3C will therefore need to be examined in
more detail in the future.
