Novel drugs like Abiraterone or Enzalutamide, which target androgen receptor (AR) signaling to improve androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT), have been developed during the past years. However, the application of these drugs is limited because of
occurrence of inherent or acquired therapy resistances during the treatment. Thus, identiﬁcation of new molecular targets is
urgently required to improve current therapeutic prostate cancer (PCa) treatment strategies. PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated
STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-1)) is known to be an important cell cycle regulator and PIAS1-mediated
SUMOylation is essential for DNA repair. In this context, elevated PIAS1 expression has already been associated with cancer
initiation. Thus, in the present study, we addressed the question of whether PIAS1 targeting can be used as a basis for an improved
PCa therapy in combination with anti-androgens. We show that PIAS1 signiﬁcantly correlates with AR expression in PCa tissue and
in cell lines and demonstrate that high PIAS1 levels predict shorter relapse-free survival. Our patient data are complemented by
mechanistic and functional in vitro experiments that identify PIAS1 as an androgen-responsive gene and a crucial factor for AR
signaling via prevention of AR degradation. Furthermore, PIAS1 knockdown is sufﬁcient to decrease cell proliferation as well as cell
viability. Strikingly, Abiraterone or Enzalutamide treatment in combination with PIAS1 depletion is even more effective than singledrug treatment in multiple PCa cell models, rendering PIAS1 as a promising target protein for a combined treatment approach to
improve future PCa therapies.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, much effort has been made to improve treatment
of locally advanced, metastatic and castration-resistant prostate
cancer (PCa). Novel drugs like Enzalutamide (formerly MDV3100;
Xtandi)1 or Abiraterone (Zytiga),2,3 which target androgen
receptor (AR) signaling to improve ﬁrst-line androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT), or the chemotherapeutic drug Docetaxel (Taxotere), which is given after ADT failure,4,5 are currently the gold
standard treatment options. Although their application resulted in
prolonged survival, a single therapy using these drugs is rather
limited because of occurrence of an inherent or acquired
resistance.6–8 Recently, it was demonstrated that PCa cells that
are resistant to Enzalutamide or Abiraterone not only display
cross-resistances to each other, but also to taxanes like Docetaxel.9
This fact further constricts treatment success in the management
of PCa and points out the importance for identiﬁcation of new
molecular targets in order to improve future therapeutic
strategies.
PIAS (protein inhibitors of activated STAT (signal transducer and
activator of transcription), which comprises a family of four
multifunctional proteins called PIAS1 to 4, are known to play a
signiﬁcant role in the modulation of various signaling pathways
via different molecular mechanisms.10,11 Besides the DNA and
protein binding ability, which is mediated by the conserved SAP

domain, PIAS proteins also contain a RING ﬁnger-like zinc-binding
domain as well as a SUMO interaction motif, thus functioning
as SUMO-E3 ligases. Recently, it was demonstrated that PIAS1mediated SUMOylation is essential for DNA repair.12,13 Furthermore,
PIAS1 is an important cell cycle regulator that promotes cell
proliferation by SUMOylation-triggered inhibition of p73 and
p53.14–16 Thus, an increased PIAS1 expression might inﬂuence
tumor initiation and progression. In this context, a role for PIAS1 in
carcinogenesis has already been suggested.17–19 In line with these
ﬁndings, we previously reported on signiﬁcantly elevated PIAS1
levels in primary and metastatic PCa tumors as well as in parentaland docetaxel-resistant tumor cells and suggested an oncogenic
role for PIAS1 through regulation of tumor suppressor p21 and
the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1.20 In addition, it has been
demonstrated that PIAS1 can also act as a coregulator of the
AR.21,22 However, the complex relationship between elevated
PIAS1 expression and AR signaling in PCa with consequences
for PCa progression and patient prognosis has not been
investigated so far.
Thus, in the present study, we assess the association of PIAS1
and AR in patient tissue samples and address the question of
whether PIAS1 targeting can be used as a basis for an improved
PCa therapy in combination with antiandrogens. Patient data are
complemented by mechanistic and functional in vitro experiments

that identify PIAS1 as an important factor for AR signaling and a
promising new target for improved future PCa therapies.
RESULTS
PIAS1 correlates with AR expression in the tissue of PCa patients
and cell lines
In previous publications20,23 we have already reported signiﬁcantly elevated PIAS1 levels in primary tumors and metastatic
lesions of treatment-naive and docetaxel-treated PCa patients
who had undergone radical prostatectomy, as well as in
docetaxel-resistant cell lines. However, the previously used cell
lines are AR negative. As the AR signaling cascade is one of the
major pathways in PCa that drives tumor progression, the
present study aims to elucidate the relationship between PIAS1
and AR signaling. Immunohistochemical analysis of 99 patient
samples (Innsbruck cohort) revealed a signiﬁcant positive

correlation between PIAS1 and AR expression (Pearson’s factor
0.674) (Figures 1a and b). Our ﬁndings were strengthened by
two validation cohorts. The Bonn validation cohort (211 patients;
Pearson’s factor 0.591) as well as the Rotterdam validation
cohort (443 patients; Pearson’s factor 0.773) conﬁrmed a
signiﬁcant correlation between PIAS1 and AR expression in
PCa tissue (Figure 1a). Finally, combining all three cohorts
resulted in a total number of 753 PCa patients with Pearson’s
correlation coefﬁcient of 0.707 and R2 of 0.50 (Figure 1a;
Supplementary Figure S1A). Furthermore, we were able to
conﬁrm this correlation in vitro. Screening of AR-positive PCa
cells by western blot and immunohistochemistry revealed high
PIAS1 as well as AR protein levels in DUCaP and VCaP cells and
low PIAS1 and AR expression in LNCaP and CWR22RV1 cells that
resulted in Pearson’s correlation factor of 0.843 (Figures 1c and d)
and R2 of 0.71 (Supplementary Figure S1B), proving a similar
situation in vitro and in PCa tissue.

High PIAS1 expression is a marker for decreased relapse-free
survival
Strikingly, by combining PIAS1 immunoreactivity score with the
pathological background data of patients (n = 735) from all three
patient cohorts, we were able to identify PIAS1 as a marker for
biochemical relapse (deﬁned as rising prostate serum antigen
levels) (Figure 1e). Kaplan–Maier statistics revealed that patients
with a low PIAS1 immune reactivity score (immunoreactivity score
≤ 4) display a prolonged biochemical relapse-free survival when
compared with patients with intermediate or high PIAS1
expression (immunoreactivity score 44; log rank (Mantel–Cox);
P-value: 0.011). However, no signiﬁcant difference in relapse-free
survival could be observed in patients with low AR expression
compared with those who display intermediate or high AR
expression (log rank (Mantel–Cox); P-value: 0.101; Supplementary
Figure S1C). Taken together, we conclude from these ﬁndings that
(1) PIAS1 expression signiﬁcantly correlates with AR expression in
primary tumors and (2) high PIAS1 expression is an indicator for
shorter progression-free survival, thereby suggesting an essential
role for PIAS1 during PCa progression.

PIAS1 expression is upregulated by androgens at mRNA and
protein levels
Given that our data both from patient material and cell lines
revealed a signiﬁcant correlation between PIAS1 and AR expression, we next wanted to evaluate the inﬂuence of androgens on
PIAS1. Thus, we treated LNCaP cells with increasing concentrations
of the synthetic androgen R1881 in the absence or presence of the
antiandrogen Bicalutamide for 24 h. Androgen treatment induced
a dose-dependent signiﬁcant increase in PIAS1 mRNA and protein
expression that could be reversed by Bicalutamide (Figure 2a).
Next, we performed a time-course experiment and treated LNCaP,
DUCaP and VCaP cells with 1 nM R1881 for 8, 24, 48 and 72 h and
evaluated PIAS1 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. In all
three cell lines, PIAS1 mRNA peaked after 8–24 h, whereas PIAS1
protein expression was maximally induced after 24–48 h
(Figures 2b and c). Immunoﬂuorescence staining conﬁrmed an
increased AR expression and nuclear translocation as well as
elevated PIAS1 levels upon androgen treatment (Figure 2d). To
exclude any unspeciﬁc effects of the treatment, the AR-negative
cell lines PC3 and DU145 were treated with R1881 for 24 h but no

change in PIAS1 mRNA or protein expression was detectable
(Supplementary Figure S2A). In addition, to prove androgenic
regulation of PIAS1, we performed short-term AR knockdown
using two speciﬁc AR short interfering RNAs (siRNAs; siAR-1 and
siAR-2), resulting in a signiﬁcant decline of PIAS1 protein (~50%
downregulation) in DUCaP as well as in LNCaP cells (Figure 2e).
PIAS1 regulation by androgens is a direct transcriptional effect
We next aimed to assess whether PIAS1 regulation by androgens
is a direct, transcriptional effect or an indirect mechanism. We
therefore compared the velocity of PIAS1 mRNA induction upon
R1881 treatment with that of FKBP5, which is known to be a direct
target gene of AR. A time-course experiment demonstrated that
FKBP5 as well as PIAS1 are rapidly upregulated upon treatment,
showing a signiﬁcant induction after 2–4 h in DUCaP (Figure 3a)
and LNCaP cells (Supplementary Figure S3A), indicating a
similar direct mechanism of AR action for PIAS1 and FKBP5.
In concordance with this hypothesis, an AR chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis previously performed
by our group in DUCaP cells24 revealed several AR-binding sites

upstream of the PIAS1 gene following androgen stimulation
(Figure 3b), with one binding site (binding site 4) located
11 269 bp upstream to the transcription start site in the PIAS1
promoter region. The in silico analysis of the respective genomic
sequence using the Encode Integrated Regulation Track (http://
nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/D1/D56.long) available in UCSC
browser (http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/6/996.abstract) identiﬁed a region that is frequently occupied by transcription factors
(Supplementary Figure S2B). In addition, JASPAR database
(http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/11/04/nar.gkt997.full)
predicted ﬁve androgen response elements within this region
(Supplementary Figure S2B). Taken together, these data strongly
indicate that PIAS1 upregulation by androgens is a direct
transcriptional event.
PIAS1 binds and stabilizes AR and protects AR from proteasomal
degradation
As PIAS1 expression was found to be androgen regulated and
PIAS1 is an identiﬁed AR coactivator,21 we next wanted to prove a
direct interaction of PIAS1 and the AR by co-immunoprecipitation.

Using a ﬂag-tagged PIAS1 expression vector we conﬁrmed speciﬁc
binding of PIAS1 to endogenous AR in DUCaP and LAPC4 cells
(Supplementary Figure S3B). Furthermore, treatment with R1881
resulted in an increased amount of PIAS1-AR complexes
(Figure 3c). Next, we wanted to evaluate whether PIAS1 inﬂuences
AR expression. Short-term PIAS1 knockdown using two speciﬁc
PIAS1 siRNAs (siPIAS1-1 and siPIAS1-3) resulted in a signiﬁcant
decline of AR protein (~50% downregulation) in DUCaP cells
(Figure 3d). It is known that PIAS1 binding to target proteins may
inﬂuence protein stability.15 Thus, we hypothesized that reduced
AR levels in the absence of PIAS1 are a result of accelerated AR
degradation. In order to verify this hypothesis, we assessed AR
decay in control- or siPIAS1-treated DUCaP cells along a time
course after adding the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide.
We observed an increased velocity of AR degradation in cells
where PIAS1 was depleted (Figure 3e). As a control, treatment with
the proteasome inhibitor MG132 caused an increase in AR levels

even in the absence of PIAS1 (Figure 3f), proving that the
proteasome accounts for the observed effect. These results clearly
demonstrate that PIAS1 delays the proteasomal degradation of AR
and is therefore a critical factor for AR protein stability.
PIAS1 boosts AR transcriptional activity and expression of AR
targets
Having shown that PIAS1 is important for AR protein stability, we
next aimed to verify a possible inﬂuence of PIAS1 on AR
transcriptional activity. Luciferase reporter assays (normalized to
cell number/protein content) after PIAS1 knockdown and R1881
treatment revealed signiﬁcantly decreased AR activity in DUCaP
and LNCaP cells, in which PIAS1 was downregulated (Figure 4a).
Functionally, the observed decline in AR activity had also
consequences on AR target gene expression. PIAS1 knockdown
resulted in reduced KLK3 mRNA expression in both investigated
cell lines (Figure 4b). However, overexpression of wild-type PIAS1

Figure 4. PIAS1 is important for AR activation, inﬂuences AR downstream targets and prolonged PIAS1 knockdown results in reduced cell
proliferation, viability and increased apoptosis. (a) AR activity was measured using luciferase reporter assays performed after transfection with

neither in the absence nor in the presence of R1881 caused
signiﬁcant changes in KLK3 mRNA levels. Summarizing these
results, we propose that PIAS1 is important for AR protein stability
and activity with consequences for the expression of at least a
subgroup of AR downstream targets.
PIAS1 knockdown in combination with Enzalutamide and
Abiraterone is more effective than single drug treatment
As PIAS1 seems to be a critical factor for AR stability and activity,
we next aimed to evaluate a possible effect on PCa cell
proliferation and survival after prolonged (6 days) PIAS1 knockdown. [3H]thymidine incorporation assays revealed a signiﬁcantly
decreased proliferation (Figure 4c). WST and sub-G1 measurements uncovered a signiﬁcantly reduced cell viability and
increased apoptosis in DUCaP and LNCaP cells where PIAS1 levels
have been depleted (Figures 4d and e). These results clearly
indicate that PIAS1 is a critical factor for proliferation and survival
of AR-positive PCa cells and might therefore be a promising

candidate for a combination treatment with antiandrogens. To
test this hypothesis we next performed single and combined
treatments with the antiandrogens Abiraterone and Enzalutamide
as well as PIAS1 knockdown. As expected, all single treatments
(PIAS1 knockdown, Abiraterone and Enzalutamide) resulted in
signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation and cell viability in LNCaP cells
and to a lesser extent in DUCaP cells. A possible explanation for
the lower sensitivity of DUCaP cells to antiandrogenic drugs might
be the increased AR expression in this cell line compared with
LNCaP cells (see Figure 1c). Strikingly, combined treatment with
either Abiraterone and PIAS1 knockdown or Enzalutamide and
PIAS1 knockdown was superior compared with all single treatment approaches as revealed by [3H]thymidine incorporation and
WST measurements (Figures 5a and b). Representative pictures of
all treatment groups (Figure 5c) showed, in general, less cells and
a more apoptotic phenotype of the remaining cells in the
combination treatment groups, thus conﬁrming the results
obtained in proliferation assays. In addition, we observed elevated

respectively. Ethanol was used as vehicle for both drugs. Data represent mean+s.e.m. from at least three independent experiments (*Po 0.05;

p21 mRNA expression within all single treatments, and this was
further increased in the combined treatment groups (Supplementary
Figure S3C).
PIAS1 knockdown results in reduced cell viability in
Bicalutamide-resistant and AR-negative LNCaP sublines
To further evaluate the potential use of PIAS1 knockdown for
treatment of cells that are resistant to antiandrogens or lack AR,
we performed single and combination treatments as described
above with LNCaP-Bic and LNCaP-IL6+ cells that were established
to mimic a castration-resistant cancer cell phenotype. Morphology
of all cell lines as well as AR and PIAS1 expression were examined
(Supplementary Figures S4A and B). Treatment with 2.5 μM
Bicalutamide had no effect on proliferation and cell viability in
LNCaP-Bic cells. In contrast, PIAS1 knockdown with both siRNAs
resulted in reduced proliferation and cell viability. Treatment with
the novel antiandrogens Abiraterone and Enzalutamide reversed
Bicalutamide resistance and resulted in reduced proliferation and
cell viability as single treatment. Strikingly, PIAS1 knockdown in
combination with Abiraterone or Enzalutamide caused an additive
inhibitory effect on proliferation and viability (Figures 6a and b,
Supplementary Figure S4C). Similar results could be observed
when LNCaP-IL6+ cells were used. As these cells lack AR, neither
Abiraterone nor Enzalutamide treatment was effective. However,
PIAS1 knockdown was sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly reduce cell
proliferation and viability (Supplementary Figure S5), demonstrating additional mechanisms for PIAS1 action beyond AR.
DISCUSSION
We previously demonstrated that PIAS1 expression increases with
PCa malignancy and inﬂuences cell proliferation and apoptosis
through p21 and Mcl-1 regulation.20,23 Interestingly, it has also
been demonstrated that PIAS1 can act as a coregulator of AR.21,22
However, the mechanistic background of elevated PIAS1 expression in PCa and the consequences for PCa tumor progression and
patient prognosis have not been investigated so far.
Herein, we prove that PIAS1 itself is signiﬁcantly upregulated
upon androgenic stimulation at both mRNA and protein levels in a
dose-dependent manner. This result is in line with ﬁndings by
Heemers et al.25 who showed increased PIAS1 mRNA in LNCaP
cells upon androgen treatment. Considering an elevated AR
signaling in PCa, this ﬁnding might provide one mechanistic
explanation for increased PIAS1 levels in PCa patients and the
observed association of PIAS1 expression with tumor malignancy
described recently by our group.20,23 In concordance with this
hypothesis, in the present study we demonstrate a highly
signiﬁcant, positive correlation of PIAS1 and AR expression in
tissue samples from three independent patient cohorts with a
total of 753 patient samples, as well as in AR-positive PCa cell lines.
Strikingly, we also prove that patients with high PIAS1 levels are
signiﬁcantly more susceptible to biochemical recurrence within 10
years after radical prostatectomy. Interestingly, despite strong
correlation of PIAS1 and AR in tumor tissue samples, high AR
expression was not found to be predictive for decreased

progression-free survival, indicating that PIAS1 is the determining
factor for the observed effect on patient survival.
In cell culture experiments we prove that PIAS1 protein directly
binds to endogenous AR and that PIAS1-bound AR is slightly more
abundant after androgen treatment. However, even under steroiddepleted conditions we were able to detect AR binding to the
nuclear protein PIAS1. This result is in concordance with a recent
publication demonstrating PIAS1 binding to AR in VCaP cells in
the absence or presence of R1881 and might be explained by the
fact that AR is partly also present in the nuclei in steroid-depleted
cells (Figure 2d.26 Functional studies show that PIAS1 binding to
AR causes stabilization of the receptor, thus supporting AR activity.
As a consequence, downregulation of PIAS1 in the presence of
androgens decreased AR transcriptional activity.
On the basis of these facts, we propose the following
mechanism (Figure 6c). The presence of dihydrotestosterone
leads to AR activation, nuclear translocation and binding to
androgen response elements. Subsequently, transcription of
androgen-responsive genes such as prostate serum antigen and
PIAS1 is enhanced. PIAS1 in turn binds AR protein and impairs its
proteasomal degradation, which keeps the receptor in an active
state, thereby supporting AR signaling. However, two open
questions remain. First, it is not completely clariﬁed yet which
mechanism is responsible for PIAS1 induction upon androgenic
stimulation. PIAS1 might be upregulated either directly via AR
binding to the PIAS1 promoter or indirectly via other signaling
molecules that are themselves inﬂuenced by androgens. Nevertheless, the fact that PIAS1 is induced as rapid (2–4 h after R1881
treatment) as the known direct AR downstream target FKBP5
indicates a direct, transcriptional effect of AR on PIAS1. In
concordance with this hypothesis, AR ChIP-Seq analysis revealed
several AR-binding sites upstream of the PIAS1 gene following
androgen stimulation. The in silico analysis of the respective
genomic sequence identiﬁed a region that is frequently occupied
by transcription factors and harbors ﬁve predicted androgen
response elements. These facts strongly indicate that PIAS1 is a
direct AR downstream target that is upregulated by androgens.
Second, the mechanism by which PIAS1 stabilizes AR needs to
be further clariﬁed. In this context, it has already been shown that
AR is target of SUMOylation.27 The consequences of AR
SUMOylation are currently not completely clear. A recent
publication reported that SUMO modiﬁcation might inﬂuence
AR transcriptional activity positively or negatively in a target geneand pathway-selective manner.28 In addition, SUMOylation has
been shown to deﬁne AR half-life in the nucleus, given that a
SUMOylation-deﬁcient AR mutant exhibited a decreased lifespan
compared with wild-type AR.29,30 The results obtained in the
present study support this view, demonstrating that knockdown
of the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 increased the proteasomal
degradation of AR. Of note, elevated AR expression and/or
stability were shown to sensitize AR to low levels of androgens
and possibly lead to castration resistance.31 Considering these
facts, we hypothesize that high PIAS1 expression might be
involved in the development of CRPC via SUMOylation-dependent
prevention of AR degradation. However, the exact role of PIAS1 in
the development of castration resistance needs to be further
investigated.

represent mean+s.e.m. from at least three independent experiments (*Po 0.05; **P o0.01; ***Po 0.001). (c) Proposed mechanism of PIAS1
and AR interaction: stimulation with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) leads to AR activation, translocation and binding to androgen response
elements on DNA, resulting in transcription of androgen-responsive genes and PIAS1. PIAS1 in turn binds AR that keeps the receptor in an
active state and prevents its proteasomal degradation. As shown in a previous study, PIAS1 acts in addition as a suppressor of p21 in PCa cells,
thereby further increasing cellular proliferation.

PIAS1 targeting and AR in prostate cancer
M Puhr et al

2330
In addition to supporting AR activity via protein stabilization,
PIAS1 has recently been shown to act as a genuine, chromatinbound AR coregulator that affects AR signaling positively or
negatively in a target gene-selective manner.22 Transcriptome
proﬁling analyses performed by Toropainen et al.22 indicate that
PIAS1 depletion affects one-tenth of all androgen-regulated
genes, among them predominantly genes involved in proliferation
and cell cycle regulation. In addition, a subset of genes becomes
subjected to androgen regulation whereas other genes completely lose androgen responsiveness in the absence of PIAS1. The
mechanism underlying these effects is suggested to be at least in
part SUMOylation of FOXA1. Thus, PIAS1 does not simply act as a
general AR co-activator but has a more comprehensive role in
deﬁning a speciﬁc transcriptional program relevant to PCa cell
growth upon androgen treatment.
In the past years, much effort has been made in order to
improve ADT. Novel drugs like Abiraterone and Enzalutamide are
promising, but the therapeutic efﬁcacy varies.32,33 Herein, we
investigated the potential of PIAS1 inhibition to improve current
PCa treatment strategies. We found that PIAS1 knockdown
increases the efﬁcacy of ADT drugs and, most importantly,
induces growth arrest and apoptosis even as a single treatment,
irrespective of the cell’s AR status or sensitivity to the antiandrogen Bicalutamide. Interestingly, we found increased p21 levels not
only after PIAS1 depletion, but also after single treatment with
Abiraterone or Enzalutamide. The use of either drug in combination with PIAS1 knockdown further increased p21 levels. Further
studies may dissect the role of p21 in the responsiveness or
resistance to Enzalutamide and Abiraterone.
In conclusion, the presented data provide the rationale for
clinical PIAS1 targeting either alone or in combination with novel
ADT drugs, such as Abiraterone or Enzalutamide.

at the University Hospital Bonn between 2000 and 2008. The study has
been approved by the institutional review board at the University Hospital
Bonn (Lfd. Nr. 071/14).
The following antibodies were used: anti-PIAS1 (1:400; ab77321, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) and anti-AR (1:200; sc-816, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA). TMAs were evaluated using the following modiﬁed
‘quick-score’ protocol: staining intensity was scored 0–3 (0 = absent,
1 = weak, 2 = intermediate, 3 = strong). The percentage of positively stained
cells was scored 0–4 (0 = absent, 1 = o10%, 2 = o50%, 3 = o75%,
4 = 475%). Both scores were multiplied to obtain an immunoreactivity
score, ranging from 0 to 12.

Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and immunoﬂuorescence was
performed as previously described.20 The following antibodies were used:
anti-PIAS1 (1:500; 3550S, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-AR (1:100;
sc-816, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit
555 (10082602, Life Technologies Carlsbad, CA, USA) and donkey-antimouse 488 (A21202, Life Technologies). Experiments were performed in
three biological replicates.

siRNA transfection
The following siRNA sequences were used for targeting human PIAS1 and
AR: siPIAS1-1: 5′-AAGGUCAUUCUAGAGCUUUAdTdT-3′, siPIAS1-3: 5′-CGAA
UGAACUUGGCAGAAAdTdT-3′, siAR-1: 5′-GCACUGCUACUCUUCAGCAdTdT-3′
and siAR-2: 5′-GACCUACCGAGGAGCUUUCdTdT-3′. A nontargeting siRNA
pool (Cat. no. D-001810-10-20, Dharmacon, Chicago, IL, USA) was used as a
negative control. siRNA transfections were performed with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All cell lines were transfected with either 25 nM of siRNAs
against PIAS1, AR or nontargeting control. To ensure prolonged knockdown of the target proteins for 6 days, all cell lines were re-transfected
with the same concentration of the respective siRNA at day 3.

Plasmids
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and chemicals
LNCaP, DUCaP, VCAP, CWR22RV1 and LAPC4 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). LNCaP,
DUCaP, CWR22RV1 and LAPC4 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamax (Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Vienna, Austria). LAPC4 cells were further supplemented with
100 nM dihydrotestosterone. VCaP cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mM glutamax
and 1.75 g D-glucose. LNCaP-IL6+ cells were generated after long-term
exposure to IL6 as described elsewhere 34. LNCaP-Bic cells are resistant to
Bicalutamide and were obtained after long-term treatment of LNCaP cells
with Bicalutamide as reported earlier.35 Identity of the used cell lines was
conﬁrmed by short tandem repeat analysis. Experiments using the
synthetic androgen R1881 were performed in media containing 10%
charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (GE Healthcare, Vienna, Austria). For
protein stability analysis, cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide
(Sigma, Vienna, Austria) or 25 μg/ml MG132 (Sigma) and harvested after
different incubation times. The lysates were then subjected to western
blot. For single and combined drug treatments, cells were transfected with
25 nM of control or PIAS1 siRNA and then treated with 2.5 μM of
Abiraterone, Enzalutamide or Bicalutamide, respectively.

Tissue microarray (TMA) and immunohistochemistry
In the Innsbruck cohort, TMA processing and immunohistochemistry
evaluation of tissue samples obtained from 99 patients and 4 cell lines
were performed as described previously.20,36 The use of archived material
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Medical University of Innsbruck
(Study no. AM 3174 including amendment 2).
In the Rotterdam cohort, use of samples was approved by the Erasmus
Medical Center Medical Ethics Committee according to the Medical
Research involving Human Subjects Act (MEC-2011-295 and MEC-2011296). TMA was constructed from 481 PCa patients as described in detail
elsewhere.37
In the Bonn cohort, a TMA was constructed from 237 patients with
localized prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent radical prostatectomy
Oncogene (2016) 2322 – 2332

Expression vectors pEGFP-C1-PIAS1 wild-type and empty control vector
were generated by Dr Yaron Galanty (Gurdon Institute, Cambridge, UK) as
described elsewhere.13 For Flag PIAS1 overexpressing construct, PIAS1 wild
type was cloned in a pDest-Flag control vector as used in Mikolcevic et al.38
Cells were transfected with 3 μg per 6-well of DNA using X-tremeGENE HP
transfection reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for 72 h following the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR
RNA isolation, complementary DNA synthesis, and real-time quantitative
reverse transcription PCR were performed as described elsewhere.39
Expression was normalized to the endogenous reference TATA-Boxbinding protein (forward 5′-CACGAACCACGGCACTGATT-3′; reverse 5′-TTTT
CTGCTGCCAGTCTGGAC-3′; probe 5-FAM-TCTTCACTCTTGGCTCCTGTGCACATAMRA-3). PIAS1, AR, KLK3 and p21 Taqman gene expression assays,
purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA), were used
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time quantitative reverse
transcription PCR experiments were done in at least three independent
biological experiments with three technical replicates.

Western blot
Western blot was performed as previously described.39 The following
antibodies were used: anti-GAPDH (1:100 000; MAB374, Millipore, Vienna,
Austria), anti-AR (1:500; sc-816, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PIAS1
(1:500; 3550S, Cell Signaling). All western blots were performed in at least
three independent biological experiments.

Proliferation, viability and apoptosis measurement
Proliferation was assessed using [3H]thymidine incorporation as previously
described.39 For viability measurement, WST assay (Roche) was performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The percentage of apoptotic
cells was assessed by ﬂow cytometry as previously described.20 For all
assays, cells were transfected twice within a period of 6 days. Measurements were done in at least three independent biological experiments
with three technical replicates.

Dual-luciferase reporter assay
LNCaP and DUCaP were transfected with 0.5 μg pGL3-ARE2TATA reporter
plasmid (Fireﬂy luciferase), 0.06 μg pGL4.73 control reporter plasmid
(Renilla luciferase) and 50 nM of the respective siRNA using Lipofectamine
2000 reagent. At day 4, cells were treated with 1 nM R1881 for 24 h,
followed by cell lysis and quantiﬁcation of luciferase activity using the
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Luciferase activity was assessed using the Chameleon 5025 (HVD Life
Sciences, Vienna, Austria) and ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity was normalized to
Renilla luciferase activity. The values were then normalized to total protein
content. Luciferase assays were done in at least three independent
biological experiments with three technical replicates.

Co-immunoprecipitation
Cells were transfected with 1 μg of pFlag-PIAS1 or empty vector. Cells were
lyzed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham,
MA, USA) and phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma). PIAS1 conjugates were
precipitated by incubating lysates with Anti-FLAG M2 Magnetic Beads
(Sigma) for 2 h. Samples were washed 2 times with lysis buffer and 3 times
with TBS and subsequently eluted with LDS sample buffer at 70 °C for
10 min. Lysates were subjected to western blot under reducing conditions.
The following antibodies were used: anti-AR (1:2000; sc-816, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-PIAS1 (1:2000; 3550S, Cell Signaling), goat anti
rabbit HRP (111-035-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Westgrove, PA, USA).
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as three independent biological experiments.

ChIP-Seq data
ChIP has been published previously.24 Brieﬂy, DUCaP cells were treated
with vehicle or 1 nM R1881 for 1 h and precipitated DNA was analyzed by
deep sequencing.

Statistical analysis
SPSS (V15.0, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) were used for statistical analyses. For all
experiments, Gaussian distribution was determined using Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test. Differences between treatment groups were analyzed using
Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U-test and were corrected for multiple
testing using Bonferroni method. Correlation analysis was performed by
the Pearson’s method. Differences in recurrence-free survival were
assessed using Kaplan–Meier plots and log-rank test. Two consecutive
prostate serum antigen measurements 40.2 ng/ml were considered as
biochemical recurrence. P-values of o0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. All
differences highlighted by asterisks were statistically signiﬁcant as
encoded in ﬁgure legends (*Po0.05, **Po0.01, ***Po 0.001). Data are
presented as mean+s.e.m. unless otherwise speciﬁed.
