ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy of brain glioma faces a major obstacle owing to the inability of drug
transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Besides, neovasculatures in brain glioma
site result in a rapid infiltration, making complete surgical removal virtually impossible.
Herein, we reported a novel kind of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) modified vinorelbine
lipid vesicles for transferring drug across the BBB, and for treating brain glioma along with
disrupting neovasculatures. The studies were performed on brain glioma U87-MG cells in
vitro and on glioma-bearing nude mice in vivo. The results showed that the CNP-modified
vinorelbine lipid vesicles could transport vinorelbine across the BBB, kill the brain glioma,
and destroy neovasculatures effectively. The above mechanisms could be associated
with the following aspects, namely, long circulation in the blood; drug transport across
the BBB via natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPRB)-mediated transcytosis; elimination of
brain glioma cells and disruption of neovasculatures by targeting uptake and cytotoxic
injury. Besides, CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles could induce apoptosis of the
glioma cells. The mechanisms could be related to the activations of caspase 8, caspase 3,
p53, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inhibition of survivin. Hence, CNP-modified
lipid vesicles could be used as a carrier material for treating brain glioma and disabling
glioma neovasculatures.

Therefore, how to effectively deliver anticancer drug to the
region of brain glioma, and to disrupt the neovasculatures still
remained to be unsolved issues.
Herein, we propose that a novel type of nanocarrier,
C-type natriuretic peptide-modified lipid vesicles, can be
used to transport anticancer drugs across the BBB, and
then eliminate brain glioma and destroy neovasculatures.
To construct these vesicles, C-type natriuretic peptide
is conjugated with a vitamin E-derived conjugate, i.e.,
22-amino acid D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol1000
succinate (TPGS1000), as a ligand material, and modified
onto lipid vesicles comprising phosphatidylcholine,
cholesterol, and distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine
polyethylene glycol2000 (DSPE-PEG2000). Vinorelbine is
loaded into the vesicles as an anticancer agent.
The BBB is a physical (but also a changeable)
barrier that maintains the homeostasis between the central

INTRODUCTION
Brain glioma is a type of tumor that originates in the
brain [1, 2]. Brain glioma cells infiltrate rapidly and disrupt the
architecture of brain tissue, making complete resection virtually
impossible [3]. Therefore, malignant brain glioma can rarely
be cured by surgery or radiotherapy alone [4]. Accordingly,
chemotherapy is used to clear tumor cells. However, treatment
with anticancer drugs is hindered by the blood–brain barrier
(BBB), which hinders the intravenously administered anticancer
agents entering the region of brain glioma [5, 6]. Studies have
shown that the BBB prevents uptake of all large-molecule and
>98% of small-molecule drugs such as anticancer drugs, apart
from temozolomide [7, 8]. In addition, the neovasculatures
of brain glioma cannot be removed readily by resection, and
angiogenesis further facilitates the growth of brain glioma [9, 10].

via a nucleophilic substitution reaction (Figure 1A). Thus,
the final product, CNP-TPGS1000, was obtained.
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time
of flight–mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (Figure
1B) showed the mean mass of COOH-TPGS1000 to be
m/z 1636 (Figure 1B1). The difference in mass between
TPGS1000 and COOH-TPGS1000 was equal to the mass of
glutaric acid and H2O, indicating the successful synthesis
of COOH-TPGS1000.
The mean mass of CNP-TPGS1000 was m/z 3816
(Figure 1B2). The difference in mass between CNPTPGS1000 and COOH-TPGS1000 was equal to the mass
of CNP and H2O, thereby demonstrating the successful
synthesis of CNP-TPGS1000.

nervous system and external environment [11]. It consists
of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs),
astrocyte foot process ensheathing vessels, and tight
junctions, including zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin
5, and occludin [12]. The BBB is a selective barrier
because some physiologic substances can transfer across
the barrier by unique pathways, such as receptor-mediated
transcytosis (RMT) [13], adsorptive transcytosis, and
opening of tight junctions [14, 15].
CNP is a type of natriuretic peptide secreted from
the heart [16], and can bind specifically to its receptor:
natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPRB) [17]. NPRB has
been reported to be expressed in the brain and blood
vessels [18], and overexpressed in tumor cells such as
pituitary adenomas [19]. Recent studies have shown
that CNP can enhance BBB permeability by disrupting
the tight-junction protein ZO-1 [20], and to attenuate
angiogenesis [21]. TPGS1000 is a vitamin-E derivative
that has been used as a functional material for enhancing
cellular uptake [22, 23]. In the present study, CNP was
conjugated with TPGS1000 for insertion onto the surface
of lipid vesicles. We aimed to: (i) transport a drug across
the BBB by RMT and opening of tight-junction; (ii) target
brain glioma cells and neovasculatures.
DSPE-PEG2000 has also been used as a functional
material for maintaining the stability and long circulation
of drug carriers in blood. This is because DSPE-PEG2000
can avoid the rapid clearance of nanoparticles by the
reticuloendothelial system (RES) [24], and facilitate
accumulation of anticancer agents into tumor regions through
the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [25].
Vinorelbine has a broad spectrum of anticancer
activity, such as breast cancer and non-small-cell
lung cancer [26]. It can eliminate cancer cells through
interaction with tubulin, thereby leading to the mitotic
arrest of cancer cells [27]. Moreover, vinorelbine has
also shown the ability to destroy neovasculatures [28].
In the present study, vinorelbine was selected as a model
anticancer agent and encapsulated in lipid vesicles for the
treatment of brain glioma cells and their neovasculatures.
The objectives of the present study were to:
(i) develop CNP-modified lipid vesicles loaded with
vinorelbine; (ii) evaluate the effects on transportation of
vinorelbine across the BBB; (iii) evaluate the effects on
eliminating brain glioma cells and their neovasculatures;
and (iv) explore the relevant mechanisms.

CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles
CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles were round
according to transmission electron microscopy (TEM;
Figure 1C1, 1C2). Their mean diameter was 106.7 ± 1.0
nm, and they had a narrow polydispersity index (0.23).
The zeta potential of CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid
vesicles was −6.48±0.21 mV. The encapsulation efficiency
(EE) of vinorelbine within the vesicles was >90% (Table
1). Release of vinorelbine from the lipid vesicles in vitro
was <10% in the initial 2 h, and <40% over 48 h in the
blood components-containing buffer (Figure 1D).
Control formulations, vinorelbine lipid vesicles, and
blank CNP-modified lipid vesicles were characterized and
had similar properties.

Transport across the BBB
To evaluate the transport effect across the BBB, a
co-culture BBB model was established with BMVECs
seeded on the upper insert whereas brain glioma (U87MG) cells were seeded on the lower well (Figure 2A).
Values for the transendothelial electrical resistance
between the upper insert and lower well were >300 Ωcm2,
which resulted in well-organized tight junctions between
BMVECs, thereby confirming successful establishment of
the BBB co-culture model.
NPRB expression in BMVECs was identified by
flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM; Figure 2B, 2C). NPRB was labeled with antiNPRB antibody and shown as green fluorescent structures
(Figure 2B2). NPRB was not detected in the control group
with isotype antibody (Figure 2B1). NPRB expression in
BMVECs was 97.35% (Figure 2C2), which was higher
than that of the isotype control (Figure 2C1).
After application of a drug formulation into the
upper insert, the transport ability across the BBB model
was characterized by the inhibitory effects upon U87-MG
cells in the lower well (Figure 2D). After treatment with
various formulations, the ranking of the transport ratio was

Synthesis of a CNP-TPGS1000 conjugate
To synthesize the CNP-TPGS1000 conjugate,
TPGS1000 was reacted with glutaric acid to form COOHTPGS1000. Then, the amino terminal of CNP was
conjugated to the carboxyl terminal of COOH-TPGS1000

CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles incubated with a
cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) inhibitor (Rp-8CPT-cGMPS; 46.10±1.28%) > vinorelbine lipid vesicles
(49.84±1.41%) > free vinorelbine (40.05±2.37%).
Transport results showed that CNP-modified
vinorelbine lipid vesicles were transferred across the
BBB model through NPRB-mediated transcytosis by
specific binding to NPRB expressed in BMVECs (Figure
2E1). After application of a cGMP inhibitor (Rp-8-CPTcGMP), the transport ability of CNP-modified vinorelbine
lipid vesicles was decreased significantly. This finding
suggested that CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles
could transfer across the BBB by disruption of tight
junctions as well (Figure 2E2) [20].

CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles, ROS activity in
glioma cells was 1.00±0.37, 2.81±0.78, 3.95±0.92, and
7.76±0.74, respectively.
To evaluate apoptotic signaling pathways,
quantification of apoptosis-related enzymes and proteins
in U87-MG cells was evaluated by a high-content analysis
system (Figure 4C). After incubation with blank medium,
free vinorelbine, vinorelbine lipid vesicles, or CNPmodified vinorelbine lipid vesicles, the activity of the
upstream apoptotic enzyme caspase 8 was 1.00±0.15,
1.28±0.07, 1.50±0.06, and 1.96±0.03, respectively
(Figure 4C1). The activity of the downstream apoptotic
enzyme caspase 3 was 1.00±0.07, 1.13±0.10, 1.24±0.09,
and 1.52±0.05, respectively (Figure 4C2). The activity
of the apoptosis protein p53 was 1.00±0.04, 1.13±0.03,
1.22±0.02, and 1.38±0.08, respectively (Figure 4C3).
The activity of the apoptosis-suppressing protein survivin
was 1.00±0.03, 0.86±0.01, 0.83±0.01, and 0.71±0.02,
respectively (Figure 4C4). Compared with control
formulations, CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles
increased the activity of caspase 8, caspase 3, and p53
significantly, but reduced the activity of survivin.
Based on the measurements of important apoptotic
proteins in U87-MG cells, apoptotic signaling pathways
are explained using a schematic representation in
Figure 4D.

Targeting uptake and toxicity to brain glioma
cells
To evaluate the targeting effect of CNP-modified
lipid vesicles on brain glioma cells, NPRB expression
in U87-MG cells was identified by flow cytometry and
CLSM (Figure 3A, 3B), respectively. NPRB was labeled
with anti-NPRB antibody and shown as green fluorescent
structures (Figure 3A2). NPRB was not detected in the
control group with isotype antibody (Figure 3A1). NPRB
expression in U87-MG cells was 93.90% (Figure 3B2),
which was higher than that for the isotype control (Figure
3B1).
To evaluate uptake by U87-MG cells, coumarinlabeled lipid vesicles were prepared and used as an
indicator of green fluorescence. Cellular uptake was
measured by flow cytometry (Figure 3C). The ranking of
cellular uptake was CNP-modified coumarin lipid vesicles
(2.98±0.03) > coumarin lipid vesicles (2.18±0.07) > free
coumarin (which was given a value of 1 as a reference).
To assess cytotoxicity, the inhibitory effects upon
U87-MG cells were evaluated by a sulforhodamine B
(SRB) staining assay. After treatment with various drug
formulations, the ranking of toxicity to U87-MG cells was
CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles > vinorelbine
lipid vesicles > free vinorelbine > blank CNP-modified
vinorelbine lipid vesicles (Figure 3D).

Targeting and disruption of glioma
neovasculatures in vitro
To evaluate the targeting effect of CNP-modified
lipid vesicles on human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs), NPRB expression in HUVECs was identified
by flow cytometry and CLSM (Figure 5A, 5B). NPRB
was labeled with anti-NPRB antibody and shown as
green fluorescent structures (Figure 5A2). NPRB was not
detected in the control group with isotype antibody (Figure
5A1). NPRB expression in HUVECs was 84.19% (Figure
5B2), which was higher than that for the isotype control
(Figure 5B1).
To evaluate uptake by HUVECs, cellular uptake was
measured by flow cytometry (Figure 5C). Results showed
that the ranking of cellular uptake was CNP-modified
coumarin lipid vesicles (3.06±0.15) > coumarin lipid
vesicles (2.49±0.12) > free coumarin (using a value of 1
as a reference).
To assay cytotoxicity, the inhibitory effects upon
HUVECs were evaluated by a SRB assay. After treatment
with various drug formulations, the ranking of cytotoxicity
to HUVECs was CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles
> vinorelbine lipid vesicles > free vinorelbine > blank
CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles (Figure 5D).
To evaluate the disruptive effect, model
neovasculatures were built using HUVECs. These model
neovasculatures showed loop-like structures (Figure 5E1).
A significant number of these structures was destroyed by

10.99±1.37%, 12.80±1.53%, and 16.70±1.06%,
respectively.
Release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in U87MG cells induced by drug treatment was also evaluated
by flow cytometry (Figure 4B). After addition of blank

glioma-bearing mice (Figure 6A). After injection of various
fluorescent probe DiR-labeled formulations, CNP-modified
DiR lipid vesicles indicated the strongest fluorescence
signal in the brain.
In the sacrificed-mice group, the brain, heart, liver,
spleen, lungs and kidneys were excised for examination
ex vivo 48 h after injection. Among various formulations,
a strong fluorescence signal of CNP-modified DiR lipid
vesicles was observed in brain tissue. In comparison, the

physiologic (0.9%) saline, free vinorelbine lipid vesicles,
or CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles on days 12,
14 and 16. Tissues were frozen, sliced, and stained
with CD31 for observation (Figure 6B). Brain nuclei
were identified as blue fluorescent structures, whereas
neovasculatures were green. After treatment with CNPmodified vinorelbine lipid vesicles, a significant number
of neovasculatures in the brain-glioma region were
destroyed compared with those treated with control
formulations.

To evaluate anticancer efficacy in brain gliomabearing mice, Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used.
After treatment with physiologic saline, free vinorelbine,
vinorelbine lipid vesicles, or CNP-modified vinorelbine
lipid vesicles, mean survival time was 24.38, 26.25,
27.63 and 34.38 days, respectively. Survival of mice

extended significantly compared with those treated with
physiologic saline (p = 0.008), free vinorelbine (p = 0.024)
or vinorelbine lipid vesicles (p = 0.047) (Figure 6C).
In addition, the preliminary toxicity assessments on
various formulations were evaluated by blood examination

and by histopathological observation on major organs.
As compared with physiological saline, there were no
abnormalities observed in blood indicators (Supplementary

via phosphorylation of tight-junction proteins, such as
activation of signaling pathways for protein kinase A and
G [33].
RMT was also responsible for the enhanced uptake
in brain glioma cells so that CNP-modified vinorelbine
lipid vesicles could kill significant numbers of U87-MG
cells (Figure 3D). This was evidenced using a cellular
uptake assay in which CNP-modified lipid vesicles could
increase coumarin uptake in glioma cells through specific
binding to highly expressed NPRB in U87-MG cells
(Figure 3A–3C).
Induction of apoptosis by CNP-modified vinorelbine
lipid vesicles contributed to the enhanced killing effect on
brain glioma cells. The strongest apoptotic induction was
observed after treatment with CNP-modified vinorelbine
lipid vesicles through activation of the apoptotic enzymes
caspase 8, caspase 3 and the apoptosis protein p53, or by
inhibition of the apoptosis-suppressing protein survivin
(Figure 4A, 4C). Furthermore, CNP-modified vinorelbine
lipid vesicles could induce apoptosis significantly by
a ROS pathway (Figure 4B). As shown in Figure 4D,
three apoptotic signaling pathways were involved. First,
activation of upstream caspase 8 was involved with a
death receptor signaling pathway, followed by initiation
of caspase 3, which led to apoptosis [34]. Second, when
the apoptosis protein p53 was activated, it permeabilized
mitochondrial membranes directly, causing the release
of cytochrome C [35]. Then, the apoptosis protein p53
facilitated the binding of cytochrome C to apoptotic
protease activating factor-1 while inhibiting the apoptosissuppressing protein survivin. These actions activated
the downstream effector caspase 9, which also caused
accumulation of caspase 3 [36]. Finally, ROS participated
in the release of cytochrome C and induced high levels of
apoptosis directly. Such activation/inhibition resulted in a
cascade of reactions that led to programmed death of the
glioma cells involved in cellular stress [37].
HUVECs were chosen to develop a model for
tumor neovasculatures [38, 39] and to evaluate the antiangiogenic effect of various vinorelbine formulations.
The strongest inhibitory activity upon HUVECs was
in the group treated with CNP-modified vinorelbine
lipid vesicles, and the mechanism could be explained
by increasing cellular uptake through binding to highly
expressed NPRB in HUVECs (Figure 5D). Furthermore,
the microscope images from the model of glioma
neovasculatures established with HUVECs in threedimensional Matrigel® demonstrated that the most
significant disrupting effect on neovasculatures was after
treatment with CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles,
and resulted from increased cellular uptake via specific
binding with NPRB (Figure 5C, 5E).
Recent studies have demonstrated the eliminating
effects on neovasculatures of vinorelbine in vitro and in
vivo. Vinorelbine could destruct neovasculatures in vitro,
by suppressing pro-angiogenic proteins IL-8 an COX-2,
by increasing anti-angiogenic proteins PPARγ and CD36

clinical course, with a median survival of <17 months [30].
Treatment of brain glioma is a major challenge owing to
the hindrance of the BBB to most anticancer agents, and
the regeneration of residual glioma cells with angiogenic
support in the tumor region [31]. We developed a new type
of chemotherapy formulation that could be transported
across the BBB to eliminate brain glioma cells and disrupt
glioma neovasculatures.
In the present study, a newly synthesized material,
CNP-TPGS1000, was inserted onto the surface of lipid
vesicles for transportation of a drug across the BBB
to target glioma cells and endothelial cells within
neovasculatures in the glioma region. We were able to
fabricate CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles that
were round, of nano-scale size, and which showed low
leakage and high encapsulation of vinorelbine (Table 1;
Figure 1C,1D). These properties allow lipid vesicles to be
stable in blood and to facilitate drug accumulation in the
brain-glioma region via an EPR effect.
Studies have shown that the CNP receptor,
NPRB, is expressed in the brain and blood vessels, and
overexpressed in pituitary adenomas. We demonstrated
that NPRB is overexpressed in BMVECs, HUVECs, and
U87-MG cells (Figure 2C, 5B, 3B). As a specific ligand,
CNP can bind to NPRB and mediate the transport of
substances across the BBB by opening of tight junctions
[20]. Also, CNP can inhibit expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [21]. Based on a BBB
model, the present study showed the existence of two
mechanisms during transport of CNP-modified vinorelbine
lipid vesicles across the BBB: RMT and opening of tight
junctions.
RMT was evidenced by the fact that significant
numbers of CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles could
be transported across the BBB by targeting interaction
with highly expressed NPRB on BMVECs in the BBB
(Figure 2A–2E). This action occurred because RMT
enables selective uptake of macromolecules across the
BBB, with endothelial cells possessing receptors for the
uptake of different ligands, including enzymes, proteins
and growth factors [32].
Opening of tight junctions was observed by addition
of an inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase: Rp8-CPT-cGMPS. In the present study, CNP-modified
vinorelbine lipid vesicles could open the tight junctions
of the BBB via signaling through cGMP and protein
kinase G [20]. When pretreated with Rp-8-CPT-cGMPS,
the transport ability of CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid
vesicles was decreased as compared with those not treated
with Rp-8-CPT-cGMPS. Furthermore, in the presence
of inhibitor Rp-8-CPT-cGMPS, the transport ability of
CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles was still higher
than that of vinorelbine lipid vesicles (Figure 2D). Tight
junctions can be highly dynamic structures that provide a
reversible membranous barrier for the BBB. Recent studies
have demonstrated that modulators of tight junctions can
also improve the permeability of drugs across the BBB

[40], and by attenuating SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway involved
in the proliferation and migration of neovasculatures [41].
Besides, vinorelbine could destroy the neovasculatures
in vivo by descreasing pro-angiogenic proteins IL-8 and
FGF2 [42].
The interaction between CNP ligand and NPRB
receptor may also have influence on eliminating
neovasculatures. It was reported that the interaction could
attenuate angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF [21, 43]. The
exact mechanism awaits further investigation. Based on
the present study, CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles
demonstrate an evident capability to disrupt glioma
neovasculatures in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism
was associated with the fact that CNP mediated the
targeting of CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles to
glioma neovasculatures, thereby enhancing the uptake of
vinorelbine, and the destroying effect of vinorelbine on
neovasculatures.
Experiments were conducted in intracranial gliomabearing nude mice in vivo, including imaging of drug
distribution and evaluation of overall anticancer efficacy.
Imaging in vivo and ex vivo using the fluorescent dye DiR
demonstrated that CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles
had a longer circulatory effect and could accumulate more
in brain-glioma regions compared with other formulations
(Figure 6A). In contrast, free DiR and DiR lipid vesicles
were distributed mainly in the liver and spleen, and were
cleared rapidly in the blood circulation.
A CD31 immunofluorescence staining method and
survival curves were used to evaluate the destructive
effects on glioma neovasculatures and overall anticancer
effects. CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles could
disrupt glioma neovasculatures effectively and exhibited
the strongest anticancer effect in glioma-bearing mice
(Figure 6B, 6C). This phenomenon could be explained
by the enhanced transport of vinorelbine across the
BBB and increased uptake in glioma cells and glioma
neovasculatures.

Human brain glioma (U87-MG) cells and HUVECs
were purchased from the Institute of Basic Medical
Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing,
China). Murine BMVECs were donated by the Institute
of Clinical Medical Sciences at China–Japan Friendship
Hospital (Beijing, China). U87-MG cells were cultured
in Eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented

serum (FBS; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA). HUVECs were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% FBS. BMVECs were cultured in
DMEM containing 20% FBS, 100 mg/mL endothelial
cell growth factor, and 40 U/mL heparin. Male BALB/C
nude mice (18–22 g) were obtained from the Experimental
Animal Center of Peking University (Beijing, China). All
cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37°C. All culture media and growth factors were
purchased from Macgene Biotech (Beijing, China) unless

Center of Peking University.

Synthesis of a CNP-TPGS1000 conjugate
A CNP-conjugate was synthesized. Briefly, glutaric
acid (0.2 mmol), DMAP (0.1 mmol) and DCC (0.24
mmol) were dissolved in DMSO (2 mL). The mixture
was stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 2 h at room
temperature. TPGS1000 (0.04 mmol) was added to the
mixture, which was stirred in a light-resistant container for
24 h at room temperature. Subsequently the crude product
was transferred into regenerated cellulose dialysis tubing
(molecular weight cutoff, MWCO, 1500) and dialyzed
against deionized water for 48 h to remove uncoupled
reagents. The resultant COOH-TPGS1000 was obtained by
freeze-drying [44].
Afterwards, COOH-TPGS1000 (10 mmol), EDC (40
mmol) and NHS (70 mmol) were dissolved in pyridineDMSO (1:1, v/v, 2 mL). The mixture was stirred for 30
min, followed by addition of CNP (Gly-Leu-Ser-Lys-GlyCys-Phe-Gly-Leu-Lys-Leu-Asp-Arg-Ile-Gly-Ser-MetSer-Gly-Leu-Gly-Cys; disulfide bridge: Cys6 - Cys22;
10 mmol), and stirring for 24 h. The crude product was
dialyzed against deionized water in regenerated cellulose
dialysis tubing (MWCO, 3000) for 48 h to remove
unreacted raw materials and solvents. The resultant
product was freeze-dried and CNP-TPGS1000 was obtained.
The product was confirmed and characterized by MALDITOF-MS using a Shimadzu (Tokyo, Japan) system.

CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles
Blank CNP-modified lipid vesicles were prepared
as described in our previous report [45]. The constituents,
40916

Oncotarget

EPC, cholesterol, DSPE-PEG2000 and CNP-TPGS1000
(60:30:5:5; mol/mol), were mixed in dichloromethane in
a pear-shaped bottle. Blank lipid vesicles were prepared
using TPGS1000 to replace CNP-TPGS1000. The solvent was
removed by the rotary-film evaporation method at 40°C.
The lipid film was hydrated with 250 mM ammonium
sulfate via sonication in a water bath for 5 min. The crude
product was treated using an ultrasonic cell disruptor
(Scientz Biotechnology, Ningbo, China) for 10 min and
lipid vesicles were extruded thrice through polycarbonate
membranes (pore size = 200 nm; Millipore, Bedford, MA,
USA).
For preparation of CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid
vesicles, the blank lipid vesicles described above were
dialyzed (MWCO, 12,000–14,000 Da) thrice in HEPESbuffered saline (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl) for 24
h and incubated in vinorelbine solution at 40°C with
intermittent shaking for 30 min (lipids:drug = 20:1, w/w).
The other two types of lipid vesicles, coumarin-labeled
CNP-modified lipid vesicles (lipids:coumarin = 500:1,
w/w) and DiR-labeled lipid vesicles (lipids:DiR = 200:1,
w/w), were prepared using similar procedures.
The particle size, polydisperity index, and zeta
potential were measured by a Nano Series Zen 4003
Zetasizer (Malvern, Malvern, UK). A transmission
electron microscope (Tecnai G2 20ST; FEI, Tokyo, Japan)
was used to observe the morphology of lipid vesicles.
The EE (%) of vinorelbine was calculated using
the formula: EE = (We/Wtotal) × 100%, where We is
the measured amount of vinorelbine in lipid vesicle
suspensions after passing over a Sephadex G-50 column,
and Wtotal is the total amount of vinorelbine in an equal
volume of initial lipid vesicle suspensions. The release rate
(RR, %) in vitro of vinorelbine from lipid vesicles was
calculated using the formula: RR = (Wi/Wtotal) × 100%,
where Wi is the measured amount of vinorelbine at the
ith time-point in the release medium phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8
mM Na2HPO4 and 2 mM KH2PO4) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum, and Wtotal is the total amount of vinorelbine
in an equal volume of lipid vesicle suspensions before
dialyses. Methanol was used to disrupt lipid vesicles, and
the concentration of vinorelbine was analyzed using highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Shimadzu).
HPLC analyses were carried out using an ODS column
(Nucleodur 100–5C18 column, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5.0
mm; Macherey-Nagel, Easton, PN, USA) at 268 nm and
40°C. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile, 0.05
M KH2PO4 and triethylamine (pH = 4.0; 34:66: 0.3, v/v).
The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Each assay was repeated
in triplicate.

receptor of the CNP ligand) in U87-MG cells, HUVECs
and BMVECs. Cells were seeded in a 12-well culture
plate at 1.5×105 cells/well in 2 mL of growth medium and
cultured at 37°C. Cells were fixed with methanol (80%,
5 min), and incubated in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 10%
normal goat serum and 0.3 M glycine to block non-specific
protein–protein interactions. Then, cells were incubated
with anti-NPRB antibody (1 µg/1×106 cells; Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) for 30 min at 22°C, whereas control
experiments were undertaken using isotype antibody (2
µg/1×106 cells; Abcam). The secondary antibody was goat
anti-rabbit IgG (1/500 dilution, 30 min) at 22°C. After
incubation, NPRB expression was measured using a flow
cytometer with 1×104 events collected, and expression was
denoted by the fluorescence intensity [46].
A confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope
with built-in software (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany)
was used to further observe NPRB expression in U87MG cells, HUVECs and BMVECs. Briefly, cells were
seeded into chambered coverslips at 1.5×105 cells/
well. After incubation for 24 h, cells were fixed using
paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) and then incubated in
PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 10%
normal goat serum, 0.3 M glycine and 0.1% Tween 20 for
1 h to block non-specific protein–protein interactions, and
to obtain permeabilized cells. Then, cells were incubated
with anti-NPRB antibody (5 µg/mL; Abcam) overnight at
4°C, whereas control experiments were done using isotype
antibody (5 µg/mL; Abcam). The secondary antibody was
goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/250 dilution, 1 h) and cells were
stained with Hoechst 33342 (4 μg/mL, 10 min). Finally,
cells were imaged and analyzed with a confocal laser
scanning fluorescence microscope.

Transport across the BBB
To assess the transport ability of CNP-modified
lipid vesicles across the BBB, a BMVECs/U87-MG cell
co-culture BBB model was established according to a
previous report [47]. Briefly, the membrane of the upper
insert (Corning, New York, NY, USA) was coated with
gelatin (2%, w/v, D-Hank’s buffer solution) for 1 h and
BMVECs were seeded on the membrane at 4×104 cells/
insert. The culture medium was replaced every 2 days.
After 6 days, U87-MG cells were seeded on the bottom
of the lower well at 6×103 cells/well and co-cultured for
24 h with BMVECs in the upper insert. Finally, the model
was established and ready for experimentation. Different
formulations (CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles,
vinorelbine lipid vesicles, free vinorelbine) were added
separately to the upper insert and the final concentration
of vinorelbine was 100 nM. In contrast, a control group
was incubated with a cGMP-dependent protein kinase
inhibitor, Rp-8-CPT-cGMPS (100 μmol/L; Enzo Life
Sciences, Geneva, Switzerland), for 1 h before addition
of a drug formulation. After 3 h, the medium in the upper

insert was replaced with a fresh BMVECs culture medium.
After incubation for 48 h, survival of U87-MG cells in
the lower well was determined by a SRB staining assay.
The transport ability across the BBB was evaluated by the
inhibitory effect in the lower insert of the BBB model.

Expression of apoptotic enzymes and proteins
(caspase 3, caspase 8, p53, survivin) in U87-MG cells
was determined using high-content screening analyses.
Brieﬂy, U87-MG cells were cultured in 96-well plates for
24 h, followed by addition of various formulations at 50
nM vinorelbine, and blank culture medium was added as
a blank control. After incubation for 6 h, cells were fixed
using paraformaldehyde (4%, 15 min), permeabilized
with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min and
blocked with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 10% goat serum
and 0.3 M glycine for 2 h at room temperature. Then,
cells were incubated with the primary antibody (1/250
dilution; Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) overnight
at 4°C, followed by incubation with secondary antibody
conjugated with Alexa Fluor®-488 (1/500 dilution;
Beyotime, Beijing, China) for 2 h at room temperature.
Cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/mL;
Beyotime) for 10 min. Finally, the fluorescence intensity
of cells was analyzed using the Operetta® high-content
screening system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and
calculated with the Columbus system.
To evaluate ROS-related apoptotic signaling
pathways, U87-MG cells were seeded in six-well plates at
5×105 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. The formulations
added were the same as those mentioned above, and were
used to treat cells for 12 h at 37°C. After incubation for
12 h, cells were stained with Dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein
diacetate (1 μM; Beyotime) for 10 min, followed by
washing, harvesting and resuspension in PBS (pH 7.4).
Finally, the fluorescence intensity of cells was determined
immediately via flow cytometry.

Uptake in HUVECs and brain glioma cells
Coumarin-labeled lipid vesicles were used to
observe uptake by U87-MG cells and HUVECs. Cells
were seeded in 12-well culture plates at 1.5×105 cells/
well in 2 mL of growth medium and cultured at 37°C.
Afterwards, cells were incubated with free coumarin,
coumarin lipid vesicles, or CNP-modified lipid vesicles at
a final concentration of 1 μM coumarin for 3 h. Cells were
washed with PBS (pH 7.4) thrice and resuspended in 300
μL PBS (pH 7.4) after filtration through a 400-mesh sieve.
Finally, cellular uptake was measured using a FACScan
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA)
with 1×104 events collected, and cellular uptake indicated
by fluorescence intensity.

Toxicity to brain glioma cells and HUVECs
To evaluate cytotoxic effects, U87-MG cells and
HUVECs were seeded separately in 96-well culture plates
at 5×103 cells/well and grown in culture medium for 24 h.
Then, cells were exposed to different formulations: free
vinorelbine, vinorelbine lipid vesicles, or CNP-modified
vinorelbine lipid vesicles. The final concentration of
vinorelbine for U87-MG cells was 0–200 nM and for
HUVECs was 0–400 nM. Blank culture medium was used
as a blank control. After incubation for 48 h, cytotoxic
effects were determined by a SRB staining assay based on
measurement of absorbance at 540 nm using a microplate
reader (Inﬁnite F50; Tecan Group, Shanghai, China).
Survival was calculated using the following formula:
Survival % = (A540 nm for treated cells/A540 nm for control
cells) × 100%, where A540 nm is the absorbance value.
Dose-effect curves were plotted from the data of triplicate
assays.

Disruption of neovasculatures in vitro
A three-dimensional Matrigel-based tube formation
assay was used to assess the activity of drug formulations
against the neovasculatures established with HUVECs.
Briefly, a 96-well culture plate was coated with Matrigel
(50 μL/well; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA)
for 30 min at 37°C. HUVECs (1×104 cells/well) were
resuspended with serum-free DMEM containing free
vinorelbine, vinorelbine lipid vesicles, or CNP-modified
vinorelbine lipid vesicles, and then loaded on top of the
Matrigel. The final concentration of vinorelbine was 0.2
μM, and drug-free culture medium was used as the blank
control. After incubation for 10 h at 37°C, tube formulation
(capillary-like structures) was observed in three random
visual fields using two-dimensional microscope images of
the culture dish (Caikon Optical Instruments, Shanghai,
China).

Apoptosis of brain glioma cells
Apoptosis of brain glioma cells induced by drug
treatment was identified using a ﬂuorescein annexin V
staining kit (KeyGen Biotechnology, Beijing, China).
Brieﬂy, U87-MG cells were seeded at 5×105 cells/well
into six-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h at 37°C.
Then, cells were exposed to free vinorelbine, vinorelbine
lipid vesicles, or CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles
for 6 h. The final concentration of vinorelbine for U87MG cells was 50 nM. Blank culture medium was used
as a blank control. After incubation for 12 h, cells were
assessed by ﬂow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) according
to manufacturer instructions. Each assay was repeated in
triplicate.

Brain glioma-bearing mouse model
To evaluate drug distribution and overall anticancer
efficacy in vivo, a brain glioma-bearing mouse model was
established by intracranial implantation in male BALB/c
nude mice (18–20 g). All procedures were carried out
40918

Oncotarget

according to the Guidelines of the Institutional Authority
for Laboratory Animal Care of Peking University. Briefly,
nude mice were anesthetized with 4% chloral hydrate
(10 μL/g) and fixed in a stereotactic device (RWD Life
Sciences, Shenzhen, China). After an incision to expose
the cranium, a burr hole was drilled 1.0-mm anterior from
the coronal suture, 3.5 mm right-lateral from the sagittal
suture, and 3 mm in depth. U87-MG cells (3×105 cells/3
μL) were implanted into the inoculation point of each
mouse at 1 μL/min.

mice, respectively. The blood analyses were conducted
with an MEK-6318K Hematology Analyzer (Nihon
Kohden, Japan). The histopathological observations
were performed on the isolated heart, liver, spleen, lung
and kidney tissues by hematoxylin-eosin stained paraffin
slices.
The remaining eight mice in each group were used
to monitor survival. Survival time was calculated from day
0 (tumor inoculation) to the day of death. Kaplan–Meier
survival curves were plotted for each group.

Imaging in brain glioma-bearing mice in vivo

Statistical analyses

Non-invasive optical imaging systems were used to
observe the real-time distribution and tumor-accumulation
ability of systemic DiR-labeled lipid vesicles in brain
glioma-bearing nude mice. Fourteen days after intracranial
implantation of U87-MG cells, mice were divided into
four groups (three mice per group) and administered (via
the tail vein) injections of free DiR, DiR lipid vesicles, or
CNP-modified DiR lipid vesicles at 100 μg/kg for each
mouse. Physiologic saline was injected as a blank control.
Mice were imaged at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h using a
Kodak multimodal imaging system (Carestream Health,
Toronto, ON, Canada).
To further observe distribution of tumor masses and
the major organs of glioma-bearing mice, the latter were
killed at 48 h, followed by immediate removal of the brain,
heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. Fluorescence
signal intensities in different tissues were photographed
using a Kodak multimodal imaging system (Carestream
Health).

Data are the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
ANOVA was used to determine the signiﬁcance among
groups, after which the Bonferroni correction was used for
multiple comparisons between individual groups.

CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, a novel type of CNP-modified
vinorelbine lipid vesicles was developed. These vesicles
could transport vinorelbine effectively across the
BBB via NPRB-mediated transcytosis and opening of
tight junctions. They could also disrupt brain glioma
neovasculatures and eliminate brain glioma cells by
targeting cellular uptake and then cytotoxic injury. In
addition, CNP-modified vinorelbine lipid vesicles induced
apoptosis of brain glioma cells. The apoptotic mechanisms
were associated with the activations of caspase 8, caspase
3, p53, and ROS as well as inhibition of survivin. In
conclusion, CNP-modified lipid vesicles could be used to
treat brain glioma and to disable glioma neovasculatures.

After tumor inoculation, brain glioma-bearing mice
were divided randomly into four groups of 11. At 12, 14
and 16 days, mice were treated with free vinorelbine,
vinorelbine lipid vesicles, or CNP-TPGS-modified DiR
lipid vesicles (via the tail vein) at 2.5 mg/kg vinorelbine.
Mice in the blank control group were treated with
physiologic saline instead.
To evaluate the disruptive effect on neovasculatures
of brain glioma, three mice from each group were killed
at 20 days to prepare frozen slices of brain tissue. These
frozen slices were stained with the primary antibody
rabbit (anti-CD31, 1/300 dilution; Abcam) and secondary
antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
IgG; 1/500 dilution; Beyotime) [48]. Then, slices
were stained with 2 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 for 10 min.
Finally, CLSM was undertaken to observe disruption
of neovasculatures in brain glioma by measurement of
fluorescence.
To evaluate the preliminary toxicity on various
formulations, the blood indicators and histopathological
changes were examined before and after sacrificing the
