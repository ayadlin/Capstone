Abstract

Author Manuscript

The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase10A (PDE10) has been mostly studied as a therapeutic
target for certain psychiatric and neurological conditions, although a potential role in
tumorigenesis has not been reported. Here we show that PDE10 is elevated in human colon tumor
cell lines compared with normal colonocytes, as well as in colon tumors from human clinical
specimens and intestinal tumors from ApcMin/+ mice compared with normal intestinal mucosa,
respectively. An isozyme and tumor-selective role of PDE10 was evident by the ability of small
molecule inhibitors and siRNA knockdown to suppress colon tumor cell growth with reduced
sensitivity of normal colonocytes. Stable knockdown of PDE10 by shRNA also inhibits colony
formation and increases doubling time of colon tumor cells. PDE10 inhibition selectively activates

cGMP/PKG signaling to suppress β-catenin levels and T-cell factor (TCF) transcriptional activity
in colon tumor cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of PDE10 in normal and precancerous
colonocytes increases proliferation and activates TCF transcriptional activity. These observations
suggest a novel role of PDE10 in colon tumorigenesis and that inhibitors may be useful for the
treatment or prevention of colorectal cancer.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozymes hydrolyze the second messengers, cyclic
adenosine and/or guanosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate (cAMP and/or cGMP) to suppress cyclic
nucleotide signaling.1 The human genome encodes 21 different PDE genes categorized into
11 families with unique substrate specificity, regulatory properties, tissue localization, and
sensitivity to inhibitors.2 Studies have implicated the involvement of specific PDE isozymes
in tumorigenesis. For example, PDE inhibitors that target PDE1, 4, 5, 7 or 9 have been
reported to induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in various tumor cell lines,3–7 while various
PDE isozymes have been reported to be overexpressed in various cancer types.3, 6–9 Despite
the well-known regulatory influence of cyclic nucleotides over tumor cell proliferation and
survival,10 no PDE inhibitor has received FDA approval for cancer.

cGMP plays an important role in the colon to regulate chloride secretion and water
transport.11 Aside from its physiological function, studies suggest that elevation of
intracellular cGMP levels can selectively inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of
human colon tumor cells.12, 13 In addition, ligands for guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) such as
uroguanylin are lost during colon tumorigenesis, while treatment with such peptides can
suppress colon tumor growth in the ApcMin/+ mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis.13–15
The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is considered to mediate the anti-proliferative
and pro-apoptotic activity from elevation of intracellular cGMP levels.16 For example, PKG
levels have been reported to be decreased in colon tumor cells compared to normal
colonocytes,17 while ectopic expression of PKG induces apoptosis.18 However, the
upstream cGMP PDE isozymes that are expressed in colon tumor cells and pathways
downstream from PKG that regulate tumor cell growth have not been well defined. A
potentially important target of cGMP/PKG signaling involves the inhibition of
transcriptional activity associated with β-catenin-dependent T-cell factor (TCF) to suppress
proteins such as cyclin D and survivin that regulate tumor cell proliferation and
survival.18, 19
PDE10 was independently identified by three groups in 1999.20–22 Compared with other
PDE isozymes, PDE10 has the most limited tissue distribution with high levels in the brain
striatum, but low levels in peripheral tissues except testes.23, 24 Studies have suggested that
PDE10 plays an important role in the central nervous system (CNS) by regulating striatal
output to reduce the sensitivity of medium spiny neurons to dopaminergic and glutamatergic

excitation.25 Preclinical studies of PDE10 inhibitors in rodent models as well as genetic
knockout experiments suggest that PDE10 may impact cognition, behavior, and motor
function. Several inhibitors are in clinical trials for treatment of schizophrenia and
Huntington’s disease.26 However, a role of PDE10 in tumorigenesis has not been reported in
the scientific literature, nor have inhibitors been described to have anti-cancer activity.

Author Manuscript

Here we provide evidence that PDE10 is involved in colon tumorigenesis from studies
showing that this enzyme is overexpressed in colon tumor cells compared with colonocytes.
PDE10 was found to be essential for colon tumor cell growth as evident by experiments
showing anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects from small molecule inhibitors and
genetic silencing. Consistent with the differential expression of PDE10 in colon tumor cells
compared with colonocytes, the growth inhibitory effects resulting from PDE10 inhibition
were only apparent in tumor cells. An oncogenic function of PDE10 was also evident by
experiments demonstrating increased mitogenesis resulting from ectopic expression of
PDE10 in normal or precancerous colonocytes. We also describe a novel pathway by which
PDE10 inhibition and activation of cGMP/PKG signaling can inhibit colon tumor cell
growth by attenuating β-catenin-dependent TCF transcriptional activity.

Results
PDE10 levels are elevated in human colon cancer

Author Manuscript

Initial experiments using human colon cell lines demonstrated that PDE10 protein levels are
elevated in HT29, HCT116, SW480, and Caco2 adenocarcinoma cell lines compared with
normal colonocytes (NCM460) as determined by western blotting (Figure 1a). PDE10 is
also elevated in the human colon LT97 adenoma line27 compared with NCM460
colonocytes. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that PDE10 expression is upregulated at the mRNA level in colon tumor cell lines compared with colonocytes
(Supplementary Figure 1). Levels of the cGMP-specific PDE isozyme, PDE5 were also
elevated, which we and others have previously reported in colon and other cancer
types.4, 9, 12, 28–31 However, other cGMP-degrading isozymes (PDE1, 2, 3, 9, and 11) were
either not expressed (PDE1), displayed limited expression (PDE2, 3, 11), or had reduced
expression (PDE9) in colon tumor cell lines as shown in Supplementary Figure 2.

Author Manuscript

To assess the clinical relevance of these observations, PDE10 mRNA levels were measured
in human colon tumor specimens using real-time PCR-based tissue arrays. Among 40 colon
tumors with disease stages ranging from Stage I to IV, 29 exhibited a significant increase in
PDE10 mRNA levels, compared with 8 samples from normal colonic mucosa (Figure 1b).
As shown in Figure 1c, the magnitude of this increase was progressive between normal
colonic mucosa and Stage II colon cancer (p<0.05). A trend showing a correlation between
PDE10 levels with more advanced colon cancer (Stage III and IV) was also apparent, but
not statistically significant due to samples with extremely high levels of PDE10 mRNA.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies were also performed to analyze PDE10 expression in
human clinical specimens from patients with colorectal cancer or non-malignant disease. As
shown in Figure 1d, PDE10 labeling was essentially undetectable in normal colonic mucosa
from patients with non-malignant disease (panel i and ii), but readily apparent in specimens

from a patient with colorectal cancer containing either adenocarcinoma or uninvolved
colonic mucosa as shown in panels iii and iv, respectively. Similar labeling of another
specimen from a patient with colon adenocarcinoma is shown in panels v and vi, in which
high magnification demonstrates that PDE10 is uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm,
although there is evidence of localization in the perinuclear, nuclear, and cell membrane
regions of the cell. PDE10 was also expressed in additional adenocarcinoma specimens
analyzed, as well as precancerous colonic adenomas and metastatic lesions in the liver as
shown in panels vii and viii, respectively.

Author Manuscript

Additional evidence that PDE10 is induced during tumorigenesis was obtained from
analyzing PDE10 mRNA levels in specimens from the ApcMin/+ mouse model of intestinal
tumorigenesis. Consistent with human clinical specimens, PDE10 mRNA levels were
elevated in intestinal tumors from ApcMin/+ mice compared with normal intestinal mucosa
from wild-type Apc mice (Figure 1e), as well as in paired tumor and normal mucosa samples
from ApcMin/+ mice (Figure 1f). PDE10 levels were also elevated in normal intestinal
mucosa from ApcMin/+ mice compared with normal intestinal mucosa from wild type mice.
PDE10 inhibitors selectively suppress tumor cell growth

Author Manuscript

Three chemically distinct PDE10 selective inhibitors, papaverine, PQ-10 and Pf-2545920, as
shown in Figure 2a, were evaluated for inhibitory effects on the growth of human
colonocytes and colon tumor cell lines. The PDE10 inhibitors suppressed the growth of
human HT29, SW480 and HCT116 colon tumor cell lines by greater than 90% with IC50
values ranging from 0.1–28 µmol/L (Figure 2b–d). Consistent with low levels of PDE10 in
colonocytes, NCM460 cells were appreciably less sensitive to treatment in which IC50
values ranging from of 8–118 µmol/L were measured. We also determined the effect of
Pf-2545920 on proliferation and apoptosis of HT29 colon tumor cells. As shown in Figures
2e and 2f, Pf-2545920 increased the activity of caspase-3 and 7 and inhibited DNA synthesis
in a dose-dependent manner within the same concentration range as its IC50 value for
inhibiting colon tumor cell growth. In addition, Pf-2545920 treatment led to a dosedependent increase in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (Figure
2g), indicating G1 cell cycle arrest.
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of PDE10 selectively inhibits colon tumor cell
growth

Author Manuscript

To further study the requirement of PDE10 for colon tumor cell proliferation and survival,
siRNA knockdown studies were performed using human HCT116 and HT29 tumor cells and
compared with colonocytes. Two sequences of PDE10 siRNA, designated as siPDE10-1 and
siPDE10-2, were used to avoid potential off-target effects of siRNA. Knockdown efficiency
was confirmed by western blotting, which showed substantial reductions of PDE10 levels in
all three cell lines, including colonocytes that express appreciably lower levels of PDE10
(Figure 3a).
PDE10 siRNA suppressed the growth of colon tumor cells within three days of transfection
by approximately 40% compared with scrambled control cells. Consistent with the selective
growth inhibitory activity of PDE10 inhibitors, PDE10 knockdown by siRNA did not

significantly affect the growth of colonocytes (Figure 3b). Knockdown of PDE10 also
induced apoptosis of colon tumor cells as measured by increased activity of caspase-3 and 7,
while caspase activity in colonocytes was not significantly affected (Figure 3c). In addition,
a significant inhibition of DNA synthesis was measured in colon tumor cells transfected
with PDE10 siRNA in comparison with cells transfected with scrambled control siRNA,
which also occurred in a tumor cell-specific manner (Figure 3d). The effect of PDE10
knockdown on cell cycle distribution was also determined. As shown in Figure 3e, a
significant increase in the percentage of cells in G0/G1 with a corresponding decrease in the
S phase was measured in HT29 colon tumor cells transfected with PDE10 siRNA compared
with cells transfected with scrambled control siRNA. Observations from PDE10 inhibitors
and siRNA knockdown studies indicate that the tumor cell growth inhibitory activity caused
by PDE10 inhibition involves the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation resulting from G1
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction.

Author Manuscript

Stable PDE10 knockdown inhibits colon tumor cell growth

Author Manuscript

Stable PDE10 knockdown cell lines were also developed using short hairpin RNA (shRNA).
For establishing stable clones, two different colon tumor cell lines, HT29 and SW620, were
used to eliminate the potential for cell line specific effects. Two stable PDE10 knockdown
clones were selected from the HT29 cell line, and one from the SW620 cell line.
Knockdown of PDE10 was confirmed by western blotting (Supplementary Figure 3a, b). As
shown in Supplementary Figures 3c and d, a 50–75% reduction of growth was observed in
stable PDE10 knockdown cells compared with vector control cells after 6 days of growth.
The effect of PDE10 knockdown on growth was especially evident by confocal microscopy
(Supplementary Figure 3e). Stable PDE10 knockdown also increased doubling time of the
cell population from 21 hours in vector control HT29 cells to 45 hours in the knockdown
cells (Supplementary Figure 3f). In addition, increased apoptosis following PDE10
knockdown was observed by measuring cleaved caspase-3 levels using western blotting
(Supplementary Figure 3a).

Author Manuscript

Colony formation assays were also conducted using stable PDE10 knockdown cells. In these
experiments, PDE10 knockdown significantly interfered with the ability of HT29 and
SW620 cells to form colonies by as much as 90% within 14 days of monolayer culture as
compared with vector control cells (Supplementary Figure 4a, b). In addition, soft agar
growth assays were performed to evaluate the effect of stable PDE10 knockdown on colony
formation under conditions requiring anchorage-independent cell growth. As shown in
Figure 3f, PDE10 knockdown substantially impaired the ability of the cells to form colonies
in comparison to vector control cells. These results indicate that PDE10 is necessary for
anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of HT29 colon tumor cells.
PDE10 knockdown selectively inhibits cGMP hydrolysis and activates the PKG pathway
To determine the effect of the PDE10 knockdown by siRNA on cyclic nucleotide
hydrolysis, whole cell lysates from transfected cells were assayed for PDE activity using
cGMP or cAMP as substrates. In comparison with lysates obtained from cells transfected
with scrambled siRNA, transfection with PDE10 siRNA reduced cGMP hydrolysis by
approximately 35% in HCT116 and HT29 colon tumor cell lines, but did not affect cGMP

hydrolysis in normal colonocytes (Figure 4a). PDE10 siRNA also did not significantly affect
cAMP degradation in cell lysates from the three PDE10 knockdown cell lines compared
with scrambled control cell lysates (Figure 4b). The selective effect of PDE10 knockdown
on cGMP signaling was substantiated by measuring the activation of the PKG and protein
kinase A (PKA) pathways in intact cells using phospho-specific antibodies against
vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which is known to be phosphorylated at the
serine 239 residue by PKG32 or the serine 157 residue by PKA.33 As shown in Figure 4c,
PDE10 knockdown by siRNA increased PKG-mediated phosphorylation of VASP compared
with scrambled control cells, but did not affect PKA-mediated phosphorylation. These
results are consistent with the lack of effect of PDE10 knockdown on cAMP hydrolysis in
whole cell lysates and suggest that PDE10 inhibition can selectively activate the
cGMP/PKG pathway in intact cells.

Author Manuscript

Tumor cell growth inhibitory activity from PDE10 inhibition is associated with suppression
of β-catenin and TCF transcriptional activity

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have reported that PKG activation can inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to
suppress the TCF transcription factor.18, 34 To determine if PDE10 knockdown can affect
this oncogenic pathway, β-catenin levels were measured along with the expression of
survivin, which is regulated by TCF transcriptional activity.35 As shown in Figure 4d, βcatenin and survivin levels were appreciably lower in PDE10 knockdown HCT116 colon
tumor cells compared with scrambled control cells. In addition, PDE10 knockdown resulted
in reduced TCF transcriptional activity in HCT116 and HT29 colon tumor cells as measured
using a luciferase reporter gene assay (Figure 4e). To determine the mechanism by which
PDE10 siRNA suppresses β-catenin signaling, the effect of PDE10 knockdown on steadystate levels of β-catenin mRNA in colon tumor cells was measured. As shown in Figure 4f, a
marked decrease in β-catenin mRNA levels was observed in PDE10 knockdown colon
tumor cells compared with scrambled control cells. Knockdown of PDE10 also significantly
inhibited the transcription of β-catenin as measured using a reporter construct that encodes
for the promoter regions of β-catenin gene (CTNNB1) (Figure 4g). In addition, levels of
phosphorylated β-catenin were measured by western blotting using a phospho-specific
antibody with specificity for Ser33/37/Thr41 residues known to target β-catenin for
proteasomal degradation, but we did not observe an increase of β-catenin phosphorylation in
response to PDE10 knockdown (Supplementary Figure 5), suggesting that suppression of
PDE10 can inhibit β-catenin expression at the transcriptional level rather than by increasing
proteasomal degradation. These findings were confirmed by observations of reduced
expression of β-catenin, cyclin D1 and survivin along with inhibition of TCF transcriptional
activity in stable PDE10 knockdown cell lines (Supplementary Figure 6).

Overexpression of PDE10 promotes growth of colonocytes and adenoma cells
Based on the above loss-of-function experiments, we predicted that increased PDE10
expression in colonocytes could stimulate growth by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
To test this possibility, gain-of-function experiments were performed using colonocytes
derived from either normal colonic intestinal mucosa (NCM460) or precancerous adenomas
(LT97) that were transiently transfected with a PDE10 expressing vector to determine if
ectopic expression of PDE10 is associated with changes in cell growth. Increased expression

of PDE10 in both cell lines compared with vector control cells was confirmed by western
blotting (Figure 5a). A 30% increase in viable cell number compared with vector control
cells was observed in colonocytes, while adenoma derived cells displayed a 20% increase
within 3 days following transfection (Figure 5b). Consistent with experiments described
above in which knockdown of PDE10 by siRNA suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling, cyclin
D1 and survivin expression were induced in colonocytes by overexpressing PDE10 (Figure
5c). These observations suggest that the mitogenic effects from PDE10 overexpression
result from an activation in Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

We show here in vitro and in vivo evidence that PDE10 levels are elevated in colon tumors
cells compared with normal colonocytes. An isozyme and tumor-selective role of PDE10
was demonstrated by the ability of specific PDE10 inhibitors and siRNA to selectively
suppress colon tumor cell growth by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Other
experiments showed mitogenic effects resulting from ectopic expression of PDE10 in
normal colonocytes. The growth inhibitory activity resulting from PDE10 inhibition appears
to be mediated by the cGMP/PKG pathway to inhibit β-catenin-dependent TCF
transcriptional activity, while the mitogenic activity from PDE10 overexpression involves
the induction of β-catenin-dependent TCF transcriptional activity. These observations
suggest an important role of PDE10 in colorectal tumorigenesis and as a novel therapeutic
target for developing potentially safe and efficacious drugs for colorectal cancer.

Author Manuscript

While these studies are limited to colorectal cancer, additional research is necessary to
determine if other tumor types involve PDE10 and are sensitive to inhibitors. However,
screening of tumor cell lines in the NCI-60 panel revealed broad sensitivity to the growth
inhibitory activity of Pf-2545920. Tumor arrays from other cancer types also revealed that
PDE10 is expressed in numerous other tumor types.

Author Manuscript

Consistent with previous reports concluding that PDE10 has a limited expression in
peripheral tissues,23, 24 low levels of PDE10 were apparent in normal colonocytes and
intestinal mucosa. By comparison, high PDE10 mRNA and protein levels were evident in
human cell lines derived from either adenoma or adenocarcinoma. Elevated levels of PDE10
mRNA were also observed in colon and intestinal tumors obtained from human clinical
specimens and the ApcMin/+ mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis, respectively.
Immunohistochemistry confirmed that PDE10 protein is expressed in adenomas as well as in
metastatic lesions. It was especially interesting that PDE10 levels are also elevated in
normal colonic mucosa from patients with colorectal cancer compared with patients with
non-malignant disease, as well as in intestinal mucosa from ApcMin/+ mice compared with
normal intestinal mucosa from wild type mice. These observations suggest that PDE10 is
induced prior to the development of tumors and may have predictive value as a cancer
biomarker.
To our knowledge, this is the first report in the scientific literature describing tumor cell
growth inhibitory activity of PDE10 inhibitors, including inhibitors in clinical trials for the
treatment of schizophrenia and Huntington’s disease (e.g Pf-2545920). The PDE10

inhibitors, papaverine, PQ-10 and Pf-2545920, were found to effectively inhibit the growth
of human colon tumor cells. By comparison, colonocytes were appreciably less sensitive,
which is consistent with low levels of PDE10 in colonocytes. Similar differences in
expression and sensitivity to inhibitors were also observed by comparing lung tumor cells
and normal airway epithelial cells. The growth inhibitory activity of Pf-2545920 was
associated with reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and G1 cell cycle arrest.

Author Manuscript

Additional experiments were performed to further study the role of PDE10 in colon tumor
cell growth using a siRNA approach. The human colon tumor cell lines, HCT116 and HT29,
along with NCM460 colonocytes were transiently transfected with PDE10 siRNA and
effects on cell growth, apoptosis, and proliferation, were determined. The results from
assays measuring viable cell number, caspase activity, and the level of DNA synthesis were
consistent with anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of small molecule PDE10
inhibitors.
Accompanying reduced protein levels of PDE10 brought about by siRNA in colon tumor
cells and colonocytes, reduced levels of cGMP hydrolysis were measured in whole cell
lysates from knockdown cells compared with lysates from scrambled control cells. In
agreement with the selectivity by which PDE10 siRNA inhibits colon tumor cell growth,
PDE10 siRNA only inhibited cGMP hydrolysis in colon tumor cells, despite comparable
reductions of PDE10 in tumor cells and colonocytes.

Author Manuscript

An unexpected finding was that PDE10 knockdown in colon tumor cells did not affect
cAMP hydrolysis, despite the reported dual substrate specificity of this PDE isozyme.20–22
The selectivity by which PDE10 knockdown induces cGMP signaling, but not cAMP
signaling, is supported with experiments showing increased phosphorylation of VASP at the
serine 239 residue, a PKG substrate,32 but not at the serine 157 residue, a PKA substrate.33
The selective effect of PDE10 knockdown on cGMP signaling as observed in intact cells
may be attributed to an abundance of cAMP degrading isozymes that compensate for the
effects of PDE10 knockdown on cAMP signaling. Alternatively, PDE10 is known to have a
higher Km for binding cGMP (3 µmol/L) compared with cAMP (50 nmol/L) and a 5-fold
higher Vmax for hydrolyzing cGMP compared with cAMP. These kinetic properties have led
other investigators to conclude that PDE10 may function as a cAMP-inhibited cGMP
PDE,20–22 which would also be supported by our observations.

Author Manuscript

Colon tumor cell lines with stable knockdown of PDE10 established by lentivirus-mediated
transduction of shRNA were found to grow slower and have impaired ability to form
colonies in monolayer or soft agar cultures. Since the ability of transformed cells to grow in
an anchorage-independent fashion is a predictor of tumorigenicity and metastatic potential,
the strong growth inhibitory effect resulting from PDE10 knockdown on the growth and
colony formation of colon tumor cells under anchorage-independent conditions provides
strong evidence that PDE10 is essential for maintaining their malignant phenotype.
Given the importance of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in colorectal tumorigenesis,36, 37
experiments were conducted to determine if PDE10 inhibition can suppress this oncogenic
pathway in colon tumor cells. PDE10 inhibition by isozyme specific inhibitors or

knockdown by siRNA were found to reduce the expression of β-catenin and inhibited TCF
transcriptional activity to suppress target genes (e.g. cyclin D1 and survivin) that regulate
colon tumor cell proliferation and survival. These observations are consistent with previous
reports showing that activation of cGMP/PKG signaling can suppress the oncogenic Wnt/βcatenin pathway and implicate a role of PDE10.9, 16, 29, 34, 38

Author Manuscript

The mechanism by which PDE10 inhibition suppresses the oncogenic activity of β-catenin
appears to be at the transcriptional level given that β-catenin mRNA levels and CTNNB1
promoter activity were reduced in colon tumor cells following transient transfection with
PDE10 siRNA. Moreover, the ability of PDE10 siRNA to suppress β-catenin transcription
paralleled its ability to inhibit of TCF transcriptional activity in colon tumor cells. Previous
studies have reported binding sites of numerous transcription factors within CTNNB1
promoter, including AP-1, TCF/LEF, E2F1, NF-κB, MEF1, Pax5, ISRE2, Smad3/4, GATA,
and ZIC.39 In addition, the translocation of PKG to the nucleus was reported,40 suggesting a
broader role of PKG in the regulation of gene transcription. It is possible that PKG can
negatively regulate a transcriptional factor, thereby inhibiting transcription of β-catenin,
although further experiments are necessary to study this possibility.
In summary, PDE10 was found to be strongly overexpressed in colon cancer cells and is
essential for their proliferation and survival. As depicted in Figure 5d, the antineoplastic
activity resulting from PDE10 inhibition involves the selective activation of the cGMP/PKG
pathway in colon tumor cells, leading to the suppression of β-catenin and inhibition of TCF
transcriptional activity, whereby the synthesis of important cell cycle proteins such as cyclin
D and survivin, are reduced. These observations suggest a novel role of PDE10 in colon
tumorigenesis and as a biomarker and therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections were cut from paraffin-embedded blocks and placed on chrome alum coated
glass slides. Mounted tissue sections were heated at 60°C for 1 hour, deparaffinized with
xylene, and rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Antigens were retrieved by
incubating with Tris-EDTA buffer (pH9.0) in a scientific pressure cooker for 10 min.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 5

min. After blocking with 3% goat serum for 45 min, sections were incubated with either a
PDE10 antibody (Novus, Littleton, CO, USA) that the specificity has been demonstrated in
previous reports43 or a monoclonal PDE10 antibody (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA) for 1 hour
at room temperature. After rinsing with Tris buffer, sections were incubated at room
temperature for 30min with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody.
3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) reactions were performed following 3 washes in Tris buffer.
Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for one minute, dehydrated and mounted
with permount mounting medium.
Growth assay

Author Manuscript

The effect on cell growth caused by treatment was determined after 72 hours of treatment
using the Cell Titer Glo Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as described previously.12
Papaverine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Pf-2545920 was
purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA), while PQ-10 was synthesized as
described previously.44
Caspase, cell proliferation and luciferase reporter assays
Caspase, cell proliferation and luciferase reporter assays were performed as previously
described.12
Cell cycle analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold 70% ethanol at 4°C overnight. After
washing with PBS, cells were treated with RNase at 37°C for 20 minutes, and stained with
propidium iodide (40 µg/ml). Cells were analyzed for DNA content by FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). A total of 10,000 events were counted for each
sample. Data were analyzed with CellQuest software to determine the percentage of cells in
each phase (G1, S, and G2/M).
Cell doubling time assay
Stable PDE10 knockdown and vector control HT29 cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture
plates in triplicate at a density of 250,000 cells per well. Cells were grown in RPMI1640
media supplemented with 10% serum and counted after 72 hours of culture. The trypan blue
exclusion test is used to determine the number of viable cells present in a cell suspension.
The assay was performed each week for 4 weeks. The doubling time was calculated as
follows: t (in hours)= h*ln(2)/ln(C2/C1). C1 is the cell number at the beginning of the
incubation, and C2 is the cell number at the end of the 72 hour incubation.

PDE assay and western blotting
The PDE assay and western blotting procedures and quantification methods were performed
as described previously.12 The PDE antibodies were purchased from GeneTex. All other
antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA).

Colony formation assay

Author Manuscript

For colony formation assays, 500 viable cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates and
were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 5% serum. Colonies were counted
using ImageQuant LAS 4000 System (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) 14 days after
staining with crystal violet.
Soft agar assay
The cell suspension (1×104 cells in 1.5ml of RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 5%
serum and 0.3% agar) was plated onto 6-well tissue culture plates containing 2.5ml of
RPMI1640 medium with 5% serum and 0.6% agar. Cells were then cultured for 21 days.
Colonies were stained with crystal violet, and counted with ImageQuant LAS 4000 System.

Fluorescence microscopy
GFP-expressing PDE10 stable knockdown and vector control cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cell nuclei were
counterstained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (DAPI; 1 mg/ml). Images were
captured by the Operetta confocal microscope (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
Experimental design and data analysis
Drug effects on cell growth and IC50 values were determined as described previously.28 All
experiments were repeated a minimum of three times to determine the reproducibility of the
results. All error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was
performed using Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
