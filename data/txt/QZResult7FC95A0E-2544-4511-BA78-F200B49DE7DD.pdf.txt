BACKGROUND: Treatment regimens for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) contain neurotoxic agents
that may interfere with neuromuscular health. In this study, the authors examined associations between neuromuscular impairments and physical function and between neuromuscular impairments and doses of vincristine and intrathecal methotrexate used to treat leukemia among survivors of childhood ALL. METHODS: ALL survivors >10 years from
diagnosis participated in neuromuscular performance testing. Treatment data were abstracted from medical records.
Regression models were used to evaluate associations between treatment factors, neuromuscular impairments, and
physical performance. RESULTS: Among 415 survivors (median age, 35 years; age range, 21-52 years), balance, mobility, and 6-minute walk (6MW) distances were 1.3 standard deviations below age-specific and sex-specific values in
15.4%, 3.6%, and 46.5% of participants, respectively. Impairments included absent Achilles tendon reflexes (39.5%),
active dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) <5 degrees (33.5%), and impaired knee extension strength (30.1%).
In adjusted models (including cranial radiation), survivors who received cumulative intrathecal methotrexate doses
215 mg/m2 were 3.4 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 1.2-9.8 times more likely) to have impaired ROM
than survivors who received no intrathecal methotrexate, and survivors who received cumulative vincristine doses
39 mg/m2 were 1.5 times more likely (95% CI, 1.0-2.5 times more likely) to have impaired ROM than survivors who
received lower cumulative doses of vincristine. Higher intrathecal methotrexate doses were associated with reduced
knee extension strength and 6MW distances. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromuscular impairments were prevalent in
childhood ALL survivors and interfered with physical performance. Higher cumulative doses of vincristine and/or
intrathecal methotrexate were associated with long-term neuromuscular impairments, which have implications on

The 5-year survival rate for children who receive treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), even without

cranial radiation, is now >90%.1 Contemporary therapy has diminished relapse rates,2 second malignant neoplasms,3
and severe neurocognitive outcomes.4,5 Nevertheless, current treatment regimens contain chemotherapeutic agents that
have the potential to interfere with long-term neuromuscular health and physical function.6
Vincristine and methotrexate, chemotherapeutic agents integral to treatment for ALL, have been associated with
acute peripheral neuropathy7 or polyradiculopathy.8 Although previous reports have dismissed these toxicities as transient
phenomena,9 recent findings indicate that many survivors have impaired neuromuscular function that persists after treatment has ended.9-14 Among these survivors, long-term dysfunction includes slowed motor nerve conduction velocities,10,12-14 absent deep tendon reflexes,15 limited ankle range of motion,11 and distal muscle weakness.13 Several small

Function Impairment in ALL Survivors/Ness et al

studies of survivors who were evaluated during childhood
or adolescence indicate that these neuromuscular impairments are subtle in the early post-treatment period and
are not always associated with significant limitations in
physical performance.10,12,14,16 Few studies have evaluated the impact of persistent neuromuscular impairment
on physical performance among adult survivors of
childhood ALL many years after the completion of initial
cancer therapy.
Studies of the association between methotrexate and
neuromuscular impairment have identified the cumulative dose, the number of intrathecal accesses, and concomitant chemotherapy as predictors of an acute toxicity.6 To
our knowledge, this association has not been evaluated
previously in very long-term ALL survivors. Investigations
of the association between vincristine and neuromuscular
toxicity have yielded inconsistent results,17,18 potentially
because small sample sizes and similar treatment protocols
with homogeneous drug doses have limited the statistical
power to detect differences.
The objectives of the current study were to comprehensively assess the frequency of neuromuscular impairments and physical performance limitations, to determine
the impact of specific neuromuscular impairments on
physical performance, and to evaluate associations
between vincristine and intrathecal methotrexate administration and loss of neuromuscular function in a cohort of
adults who were treated for childhood ALL and who have
survived at least 10 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Individuals who were included in these analyses were participants in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort, a study that was
designed to evaluate medical and psychosocial late effects
of childhood cancer and its treatment.19 Potentially eligible participants (n ¼ 4024 survivors with all diagnoses; n
¼ 1231 survivors with ALL) were treated at St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital for childhood cancer
between 1962 and 2001. All participants were aged 18
years and had survived for at least 10 years since their
original cancer diagnosis. Protocol enrollment started in
November 2007 and is ongoing. Potentially eligible participants were assigned randomly to blocks of 50 for
recruitment. These analyses include survivors of childhood ALL who were assigned to 1 of the first 32 recruitment blocks and who completed an initial medical
follow-up visit and functional assessment between
November 2007 and February 2011.

The outcomes of interest for these analyses included
clinical measures of neuromuscular impairment and physical performance limitations. Ankle tendon reflexes, touch
and vibratory sensation, ankle range of motion and
strength, quadriceps strength, balance, mobility, and
walking efficiency were evaluated. For ankle reflexes, the
foot was gently dorsiflexed, and the Achilles tendon was
tapped with a reflex hammer while observing and palpating for a contraction of the gastrocnemius. If there was no
response, then the patient was asked to interlock and pull
with flexed fingers to provide reinforcement.20 Reflexes
were classified as absent only if there was no muscle contraction even with reinforcement. The plantar surface of
the great toe was examined for protective touch sensation
with a 5.07/10 g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament and
for vibration with a Bio-Thesiometer (Bio-Medical
Instrument Company, Newbury, Ohio) at 120 cycles per
second.21 Vibration was considered absent at thresholds
greater than 0.616 microns.21 Active ankle dorsiflexion
range-of-motion (ROM) was measured with a goniometer and was considered impaired at values <5 degrees.22
While sitting with the hip and knee supported, lower
extremity muscle strength was measured for isokinetic
dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, and knee extension at 60
degrees per second (Biodex III Myometer; Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). Peak torque from among 5 repetitions was used for analysis. Strength was considered
impaired when the peak torque value for that motion was
<1.3 standard deviations below height-specific, weightspecific, age-specific, and sex-specific mean values.23,24
Balance, defined as the ability to maintain a standing
position, was measured by having the participant complete the sensory organization test (SOT) on a computerized dynamic posturography system (Neurocom
International, Clackamas, Ore). Participants were asked
to stand on dual force plates that were pitched up or down
in an anterior-posterior direction to provoke ankle
motion. A colored visual screen surrounded the participant on 3 sides. Visual and kinesthetic inputs were manipulated to create 6 different conditions, each of which
included three 20-second trials. During testing, the device
continuously recorded the participant’s center of pressure
over the force plates. A difference score was computed
from the normal range of anterior-posterior sway (12.5
degrees), and the maximum range of sway of the participant on each trial was averaged and expressed as a percentage. A higher score indicated less sway. Participants who
scored <70% on the SOT were classified as having a
balance limitation.25,26

Mobility was evaluated with the ‘‘timed-up-and-go’’
test (TUG), and walking efficiency was evaluated with the
6-minute walk test (6MW). For the TUG, participants
were asked to rise from a sitting position in a chair, walk
10 feet, turn, and return to the sitting position. They were
encouraged to complete this task as fast as possible. Two
trials were attempted by each participant, and the time
taken to complete the second trial was recorded and used
for analysis. Individuals with TUG times >1.3 standard
deviations from population-based mean values were classified as having poor mobility.27 For the 6MW, participants were asked to walk as fast as possible along a
corridor for 6 minutes. Customary walking aids (canes,
walkers, crutches) were allowed, and the walking distance
was recorded in meters. Individuals who walked distances
1.3 standard deviations below predicted sex-adjusted,
age-adjusted, height-adjusted, and weight-adjusted
distances were classified as having limited walking
efficiency.28
Demographic and treatment information was
abstracted from medical records. We considered sex as a
dichotomous variable, age at diagnosis as a continuous
variable, and cranial radiation and 5 chemotherapeutic
agents as both dichotomous and continuous variables.
Data distributions were examined to establish representative categories for treatment exposures, resulting in
classifications of cranial radiation exposure as none or
any; intrathecal methotrexate exposure as none, 47 to
214 mg/m2, or 215 to 694 mg/m2; and vincristine exposure as 3 to 38 mg/m2 or 39 mg/m2. It is noteworthy
that glucocorticoids in prednisone equivalent doses,
intravenous methotrexate, epipodophyllotoxins, and
asparaginase were not associated with the outcomes, nor
did they appreciably alter final models, so they were not
included in multivariable analyses.
Chronic conditions that were considered confounders in the associations between neuromuscular impairments and balance, mobility, and fitness included
unresolved cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction, diabetes,
and peripheral vascular disease. Chronic conditions were
confirmed with electrocardiography, electrocardiogram,
pulmonary function testing, laboratory, and clinical
evaluation.
Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges,
were calculated to characterize the demographic and treatment characteristics of the study population. Participants
were compared with nonparticipants using chi-squared
statistics and t tests for paired data. The percentages of

830

survivors with impaired neuromuscular outcomes and
physical performance limitations also are reported. The
associations between demographic and treatment characteristics and the neuromuscular outcome variables were
evaluated in multiple variable logistic regression models.29
Associations between reflexes, touch and vibratory sensation, ankle ROM and strength, and physical performance
were evaluated in multiple variable regression models
using logistic regression29 when the outcome was dichotomous and general linear regression30 when the outcome
was continuous. Models were adjusted for age and sex and
for prevalent cardiopulmonary conditions, diabetes, and
peripheral vascular disease. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all analyses.

RESULTS
Among the 1559 members in the first 32 blocks of the St.
Jude Lifetime Cohort, 746 had a previous diagnosis of
ALL and were mailed a recruitment letter. Among these
individuals, 687 have been contacted, 609 (88.6% of
those contacted) agreed to undergo a risk-based medical
evaluation, and 461 (67.1% of those contacted) have
completed their assessments (Fig. 1). Among the 461
participants who completed their medical evaluations, 46
(9.9%) did not complete the physical performance
portion of the assessment: Thirteen had severe chronic
cardiac or pulmonary problems, and 7 had acute musculoskeletal injuries that precluded completion. Two individuals were paraplegic, 3 were too large for the equipment, 6
were unable to follow directions, and 15 declined some or
all of the testing procedures. Characteristics of the participants and nonparticipants are listed in Table 1. The
median age of the study participants was 35.6 years
(range, 21.9-52.3 years), and the median time since diagnosis was 29.9 years (range, 13.7-46.5 years). Participants
did not differ from nonparticipants by current age, age at
diagnosis, or time since diagnosis. Those who were unable
to complete or who declined the functional assessment
were more likely to be obese (65.2% vs 46.5%) and had
survived slightly longer than those who participated in the
physical performance assessment (median, 33 years
[range, 14-47 years] vs median, 29 years [range, 13-46
years]). Participants were more likely to be women
(51.1% vs 42.4%) and to self-report their race as white
(93.7% vs 89.1%) than nonparticipants. The distribution
of cranial radiation and chemotherapy doses were similar
among participants and nonparticipants.

tective touch sensation at the great toe were absent among
12.3% and 3.9% of survivors, respectively. The median
number of impairments in this cohort was 1 (range, 0-8
impairments). Nearly half (49.9%) of the cohort had 2 or
more impairments, and slightly more than one-quarter
(27%) had 3 impairments.
The most common physical performance limitation
was limited walking efficiency; 46.5% of participants
achieved distances during the 6MW in the lowest 10th
percentile compared with age-matched, sex-matched,
height-matched, weight-matched normative values.28 In
fact, the average distance walked by participants in our
study was similar to the predicted 6MW distance for individuals of the same height, weight, and sex distribution
among those aged 50 years (569  109 meters for ALL
survivors vs 566  58 meters predicted for individuals
aged 50 years).28 Impaired balance was demonstrated in
15.4% of survivors, and mean scores on the sensory organization test were slightly lower than those typically
reported for individuals ages 60 to 69 years (76% vs
77.6%).31 Condition-specific balance scores among those
with limited balance were global and were lower than
expected in each of the 6 conditions, deteriorating and
becoming widely variable with each added balance challenge. The mean percentages of time spent within the
12.5-degree sway envelope were 92.4%  4.7%, 88.2%
 5.8%, 84.3%  13.3%, 67.4%  18.4%, 36% 
20.2%, and 33.9%  21.6% for conditions 1 through 6,
respectively Poor performance on the TUG, an indicator
of significant mobility limitations, was present in only
3.6% of survivors. Over half of the cohort had at least 1
physical performance limitation (54.5%). However, only
9.2% had more than 1 physical performance limitation.
Table 2 provides results from the final multivariable
models that examined associations between sex, impaired
active dorsiflexion ROM, knee extension strength, loss of
protective sensation, and performance on tests of balance,
mobility, and walking efficiency. All models were adjusted
for age. The models with the mobility and walking efficiency outcomes also were adjusted for height and weight.
The walking efficiency outcome model also was adjusted
for echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Other predictors of interest (vibratory sensation,
reflexes, dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength,
acknowledged neuropathic symptoms) and potential confounders (pulmonary conditions, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease) were not associated independently with
outcomes, nor did they influence the strength of the associations, so they were not included in final models.

(95% CI, 1.2-9.8 times) more likely than those who did

reduced knee extension strength (OR, 3.7 [95% CI, 1.211.2] for 47-214 mg/m2 vs no intrathecal methotrexate;
OR, 4.1 [95% CI. 1.3-13.2] for 215-694 mg/m2 vs no intrathecal methotrexate).

DISCUSSION
The results from this study indicate that <50% of adult
survivors of childhood ALL experience long-term lower
extremity neuromuscular impairments. However, when
these neuromuscular impairments are present, they
adversely impact physical performance. In addition,
models adjusted for age, sex, and cranial radiation indicated an association between intrathecal methotrexate
doses and persistent problems with ankle ROM, knee
extension strength, and, ultimately, performance on the

6MW test. Cranial radiation was not associated with these
problems.
Limited ankle ROM and quadriceps muscle weakness are particularly concerning in a cohort of adults in
their mid-30s. In other populations, loss of normal ankle
ROM limits the ability to maintain upright standing during daily tasks that require reaching,32 is associated with
early foot ulceration,33 and predicts reduced functional
abilities and physical activity levels.34 Knee extension
weakness is associated with the development of osteoarthritis,35 reduced walking speed,36 and even early mortality.37 Newman et al,37 in the Health, Aging, and Body
Composition Study cohort, reported hazard ratios for
death of 1.51 (95% CI, 1.28-1.79) among men and 1.65
(95% CI, 1.19-2.30) among women for each 38 Newton
meter decrease in quadriceps strength.
In our current cohort of survivors aged 30 to 40
years, balance testing and 6MW values corresponded to
scores typically reported in much older adults. Poor performance on the sensory organization test is associated
with increased risk for falls in elderly populations.38
Because long-term ALL survivors are at increased risk for
low bone mineral density at an early age,39 fall-related
fractures and their associated morbidities are of heightened concern. Also, because 6MW distances are highly
correlated with cardiac and pulmonary function and with

weakness in 11 children after 8 doses of vincristine at
1.5 mg per dose for remission induction and intensification therapy. Wright et al11 reported a 10-degree differences in ankle dorsiflexion ROM when they compared ALL
survivors at least 1 year off therapy with age-matched and
sex-matched normal controls, and Ramchandren et al14
reported abnormalities in both sensory and motor nerve
conduction studies in a group of 37 ALL survivors at an
average of 7.4 years post-treatment. Our study of a large
adult cohort of childhood ALL survivors, at an average of
28 years from their original cancer diagnosis, indicates
that these problems are present and negatively impact
neuromuscular function.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to document an association between dose of intrathecal methotrexate administration and neuromuscular impairment in

long-term adult survivors of childhood ALL. Several case
studies and small clinical series provide some evidence
that involvement also may include more proximal neural
structures, and these deficits potentially are related to the
administration of intrathecal methotrexate. Anderson
et al43 reported acute polyradiculopathy in a girl aged 3
years after intrathecal chemotherapy during the maintenance phase of therapy for ALL. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. Electromyographic findings
5 months after symptom onset were consistent with
denervation and early reinervation. Koh et al44 reported
progressive paraparesis after intrathecal methotrexate
administration for CNS prophylaxis in 3 children with
ALL. Gadolinium enhancements of anterior lumbosacral

the 3 children. Harila-Saari et al10 evaluated motor
evoked potentials in 32 children after the completion of
treatment for ALL and observed prolonged latencies in
both upper and lower extremity axons when responses
were compared with an age-matched, sex-matched, and
height-matched control group. The same authors12 also
used somatosensory evoked potentials to evaluate central
and peripheral axonal integrity in 31 childhood ALL survivors who were at least 2 years off therapy. Compared
with age-matched and sex-matched controls, median
nerve stimulation in ALL survivors demonstrated prolonged somatosensory evoked potential latencies at the level
of the brachial plexus and spinal cord as well as prolonged
latencies at the level of the spinal cord and cortex with tibial
nerve stimulation at the knee. Lehtinen et al13 demonstrated
that peripheral neuropathy persisted up to 5 years off-therapy as measured by motor evoked potentials in 27 children
who were treated for ALL. Among our cohort of adult survivors, motor impairment was more common than sensory
loss. In addition, intrathecal methotrexate was associated, in
a dose-response fashion, with poor motor outcomes, perhaps
indicating a lasting effect of this treatment on ventral nerve
roots.
Our findings also indicate that these lasting neuromuscular impairments are associated with eventual limitations in balance, mobility, and walking efficiency. This is
in contrast to another recently published study that evaluated this association among 37 child (ages 8-18 years)
ALL survivors.14 On average, these young survivors were
7.4 years from diagnosis. Although nearly all had evidence
of motor neuropathy involving both upper and lower
extremities, only 1 child scored below expected values on
the test of motor proficiency. The authors concluded that
objective deficits in nerve conduction and persistent signs
and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy were not associated with limited physical performance in their young
population. These differential findings may be because
the physical performance measures we used were very different or because younger survivors are better able to compensate for neuromuscular deficits than our older group
of survivors. We speculate that long-term ROM losses
and weakness may initiate a cycle of disuse and/or physical
inactivity. Early neuromuscular deficits, when combined
with the increased body weight that can accompany aging,
may stress skeletal and joint structures. Additional loss of
strength and motion eventually may progress to such a
level that they interfere with abilities to maintain balance,
move from sit to stand, and walk at speeds required for
efficient community mobility.

836

Both balance and mobility limitations were associated with women in our ALL survivor cohort. These findings are consistent with a study among 234 older adults
(mean age, 76  5 years) by Wolfson et al,45 who reported
that women demonstrated greater sway than men when
presented with balance challenges during the sensory
organization test, and with a study by Vereeck et al,46 who
evaluated both balance and mobility in a cohort of 318
healthy volunteers (180 women; mean age, 48.9  18.7
years). Those authors reported that women were less likely
than men to be able to stand for 30 seconds with their feet
in a tandem position with their eyes closed, to stand on 1
leg for 10 seconds with their eyes opened, and to stand on
foam for 30 seconds with their eyes closed. Vereeck et al46
also reported that, on average, women took longer than
men to complete the TUG and that the effect of age on
performance during this task was greater among women
than among men. The reasons for these differences probably are multifactorial. They may be biomechanical or
perhaps related to experience. Women are not as strong as
men, even when body size is taken into account, and they
may be less likely to participate in activities that require
the use of complex balance strategies, which can limit
their opportunities to develop optimal responses to postural perturbation.
The results from this study should not be interpreted
without taking into account potential study limitations.
First, although our testing included validated measures of
neuromuscular function to document impairment, we
did not use quantitative nerve conduction velocity testing
or evoked potentials to evaluate peripheral nerve integrity
in our study participants. It is possible that our outcomes
reflect only the effects of long-term disuse rather than persistent nervous system damage in this population. Bidirectional effects or complex interactions among
neuromuscular impairments are likely to contribute to
limitations in performance in this population. Second,
because we did not complete performance-based testing
on these individuals during treatment, we do not know
whether or not those who experienced poor long-term
outcomes were those who had neuromuscular impairment
acutely. Finally, our survivors were at least 10 years from
their original diagnosis. It is possible that our findings
may not directly apply to children treated with contemporary regimens for ALL. Nevertheless, we remain concerned that our findings are pertinent to patients who
receive current treatment protocols that feature intensive
vincristine and intrathecal methotrexate at doses similar
to those received by the participants in our study cohort.

Function Impairment in ALL Survivors/Ness et al

In conclusion, long-term adult survivors of childhood ALL in their mid-30s are at risk for neuromuscular
impairments and physical performance limitations that
typically are not observed in otherwise normal adults until
at least their sixth decade of life. These late effects were
associated with increased cumulative doses of intrathecal
methotrexate and, to a lesser extent, with vincristine exposure. These findings are novel and important, because
these treatments continue to be administered to children
on contemporary clinical protocols. The neuromuscular
impairments, principally limited ROM and muscle weakness, may be amenable to simple interventions like
stretching and strengthening so that long-term functional
limitations are ameliorated.
