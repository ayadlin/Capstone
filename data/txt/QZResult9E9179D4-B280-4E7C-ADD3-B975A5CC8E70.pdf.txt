ABSTRACT
Despite great advances in the treatment of acute leukemia, a renaissance of current
chemotherapy needs to be improved. The present study elucidates the underlying
mechanism of a new synthetic quinoline derivative, MPT0B392 (B392) against acute
leukemia and its potential anticancer effect in drug resistant cells. B392 caused mitotic
arrest and ultimately led to apoptosis. It was further demonstrated to be a novel
microtubule-depolymerizing agent. The effects of oral administration of B392 showed
relative potent anti-leukemia activity in an in vivo xenograft model. Further investigation
revealed that B392 triggered induction of the mitotic arrest, followed by mitochondrial
membrane potential loss and caspases cleavage by activation of c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK). In addition, B392 enhanced the cytotoxicity of sirolimus in sirolimusresistant acute leukemic cells through inhibition of Akt/mTOR pathway and Mcl-1
protein expression, and also was active in the p-glycoprotein (p-gp)-overexpressing
National Cancer Institute/Adriamycin-Resistant cells with little susceptibility to p-gp.
Taken together, B392 has potential as an oral mitotic drug and adjunct treatment for
drug resistant cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

over-activated pathways and p-glycoprotein (p-gp)
overexpression are the most common drug-resistance
mechanisms in chemotherapy [7]. P-glycoprotein, a family
member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters,
pumps out its substrate, such as vincristine or paclitaxel,
to decrease the concentrations of drugs within the cells,
and which plays an essential role in MTA-caused drug
resistance [8].
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a
key serine/theonine kinase, regulates various cellular
processes required for protein synthesis, growth, and
cell cycle progression and metabolism [9]. Genetic
mutations, over-activated tyrosine kinase receptors, and
amplification of key factors in PI3K/AKT pathways have
been identified to lead to abnormal activation of mTOR
signaling in leukemia [10]. Thus, mTOR inhibitors were
investigated in preclinical and clinical antitumor studies,

Current therapy for most types of acute leukemia
consists of traditional chemotherapy, including
microtubule-targeting agents (MTA) such as vincristine
[1–4]. MTA have been used for decades in a majority of
malignancies, including prostate cancer, ovarian cancer,
breast cancer, non-small lung cancer, and hematological
malignances [5], and they continue to produce impressive
clinical outcomes. Despite their reputation as oldfashioned drugs, many MTA have been developed and
tested in ongoing clinical trials [6].
Resistance to chemotherapy has been an essential
issue in current cancer treatment over the past cascades.
The mechanisms of chemotherapeutic resistance, which
can be divided into intrinsic and acquired, vary in
different types or stages of cancers. Tumor cell-specific

such as leukemia, lymphoma, endometrial carcinoma,
renal carcinoma, breast cancer and glioblastoma [11].
Quinoline derivatives possess many diverse
biological activities, including antifungal [12], antimalarial
[13, 14], and anticancer effects [15–17]. The present
study investigates the anticancer effect of a new synthetic
quinoline compound, MPT0B392 (B392; 6-methoxy-2(3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzenesulfonyl)-quinolin-5-ylamine),
on acute leukemia and drug resistance. We found that
B392 inhibited tubulin polymerization and induced c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, leading to apoptosis.
More importantly, B392 can be administered orally in an
in vivo leukemic cell xenograft model. Additionally, B392
potentiated cytotoxicity in sirolimus (rapamycin)-resistant
acute leukemic cells and the multidrug resistant cell line.
It was further be demonstrated not a p-gp substrate.
The results of the present study suggest that B392, as a
developmental drug, could have a potential use in the
clinics, especially applied in second line chemotherapy.

studiesy were workable. Moreover, immunochemistry
staining and tumor homogenates show that B392
treatment induced apoptosis in cancer cells, demonstrated
by detection of positive staining of cleavage caspase 3
(Figure 2E, 2F). Taken together, these data suggest that
B392 exhibited anticancer activity with less cytotoxicity
both in vitro and in vivo.

The effect of B392 on microtubule dynamics
Microtubules play an important role in cell mitosis,
and administration of microtubule-binding agents usually
result in mitotic arrest [5]. Therefore, we used an in vitro
tubulin-polymerization assay as well as tubulin staining
(observed using confocal microscopy) to assess whether
B392 had an effect on tubulin and would lead to cells
accumulation in G2/M phase. As seen in Figure 3A, B392
caused tubulin depolymerization in vitro and disrupted
microtubule formation, as observed by diffusion of stained
tubulin into the cytoplasm, which phenomena was also
shown in vincristine treatment. Paclitaxel and vincristine
were utilized as positive controls for tubulin polymerization
and depolymerization, respectively (Figure 3B).
To clarify the mechanism by which B392 induced
G2/M cell cycle arrest in leukemic cells, we observed
the expression of G2/M regulatory proteins. As cells
enter mitosis, a variety of proteins are phosphorylated
either directly or indirectly by M-phase-promoting factor
(MPF) [18]. MPM2, an antibody that can specifically detect
the phosphorylation of M phase regulatory proteins, is often
used to differentiate the phase in which cells accumulate
(e.g. G2 or M phase). The results show that B392
treatment upregulated intracellular MPM2 and cyclin B1
and downregulated the inhibitory Try-15 residue of Cdk1
(cdc2), indicating that B392 induced cell arrest in M phase.
Additionally, increased expression of Aurora A and B
(mitotic spindle kinases), which play a role in the regulation
of cell division [19] as well as phosphorylation of H3S10,
suggested that B392 might activate the mitotic checkpoint
(Figure 3C; Supplementary Figure 2D). Our data suggests
that B392 is a novel microtubule-destabilizing agent that
induces mitotic arrest in leukemic cells.

RESULTS
Evaluating the anticancer effect of B392 in
leukemic cell lines
To determine the in vitro antitumor activity of B392
(Figure 1A), we performed an MTT assay in leukemic
cell lines. As shown in Figure 1B, B392 inhibited the cell
viability of HL60, MOLT-4, and CCRF-CEM cells in a
concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 0.02,
0.03, and 0.02 µM, respectively, at 48 h; and it shows
better cytotoxic effect than vincristine in primary AML
cells (Supplementary Figure 1A). Moreover, B392 caused
less sensitivity in normal cells, including BEAS (human
bronchial epithelial cells), HUVECs (human umbilical
vein endothelial cells) (Figure 1C) and PBMC (peripheral
blood mononuclear cell) (Supplementary Figure 1B). To
investigate the mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity
exhibited by B392, we further evaluated cell cycle
progression after treatment with B392. The data show that
B392 triggered cells arrest in the G2/M phase, followed
by accumulation in subG1 phase in a concentration and
time-dependent manner (Figure 1D; Supplementary
Figure  2A–2C). In conclusion, B392 displayed more
sensitive on leukemic cells than normal cells.

Evidence of B392-triggered apoptosis
Mitochondria play a crucial role in cells
undergoing the apoptotic process [20]; hence, we further
evaluated the expressions of mitochondrial proteins and
mitochondrial function, which was assessed by measuring
the permeability of their outer membranes. As seen in
Figure  4A, B392 caused the phosphorylation of Bcl-2,
Mcl-1S (Mcl-1 short form) increase and decrease in Mcl1L (Mcl-1 long form), which provided evidence that
mitochondrial membrane potential time-dependently lost
in HL60 cells (Figure 4B). Mcl-1S, a splicing variant of
the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 (Mcl-1L), is a proapoptotic protein

B392 induces apoptosis in xenograft models
The MOLT-4 and HL60 xenograft model studies
were performed to evaluate B392 as a potential anticancer
drug for the treatment of leukemia. Figure 2A shows
that B392 treatment resulted in significant tumor
growth delay (83.3%) and tumor volume inhibition
(P < 0.01) (Figure 2A, 2C), without loss of body weight
(Figure 2B, 2D). Here, vincristine treatment group was
used to be a positive control to demonstrate the animal

JNK activation plays a key role in B392-induced
apoptosis of leukemic cells

[21]. Induction of apoptosis by B392 was elucidated by
the observation of a hypodiploid peak (subG1) in leukemic
cells (Figure 1D). The activation of caspase 3, 7, 8, 9 and
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in a
time-dependent manner further confirmed B392-induced
apoptosis (Figure 4C). These data suggest that B392 has
an effect on mitochondrial proteins, membrane potential
as well as activation of the classic apoptosis pathway and
ultimately cell death.

It has been reported that differential regulation of
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is induced by
microtubule binding agents [22, 23]. To further investigate
the mechanism of B392-induced cell apoptosis, we analyzed
the phosphorylation of JNK, P38, and extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) after treatment with B392. The

results show that p-JNK and p-P38 were induced by B392
in a time-dependent manner, with maximum induction
observed at 24 and 36 h (Figure 5A). We used a p-P38
inhibitor (SB203580) and p-JNK inhibitor (SP600125)
to identify the specific MAPK involved in B392-induced
cell death. The data on cell cycle distribution revealed that

only SP600125 was able to reverse B392-induced subG1
accumulation (Figure 5B, 5C; Supplementary Figure 3) as
well as the expressions of mitochondrial proteins (p-Bcl-2,
and Mcl-1), caspase 3, and PARP (Figure 5D) in HL60 cells.
The above observation was not found after co-treatment
with SB203580 and B392 (Data not shown).

B392 enhanced the cytotoxicity of sirolimus in a
sirolimus-resistant cell line

the sirolimus-resistant cell line, HL60, a combination of
sirolimus with B392 enhanced the cytotoxicity of sirolimus
compared to sirolimus alone; however, this phenomenon was
not observed in the sirolimus-sensitive cell line, MOLT-4
(Figure 6B; Supplementary Table 1). The combination of
B392 and sirolimus clearly induced PARP and caspase 3
cleavage, as well as downregulated a key prosurvival protein,
Mcl-1 (Figure 6C, left panel). The effect of a sirolimus-B392
combination on AKT/mTOR signaling was also determined.
B392 alone only had a slight effect on the AKT/mTOR
pathway; however, the combination dramatically decreased
the expression of p-AKT and p-mTOR, as well as mTOR’s
downstream targets, p-P70S6K and p-4EBP1 (Figure 6C,
right panel). Taken together, B392 can strengthen the effect
of sirolimus on mTOR signaling and can enhance cytotoxicity
in sirolimus-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells.

It has been shown that a number of genetic mutations
elevate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, and contribute to cell
proliferation, survival, and drug resistance in leukemia
[24, 25]. Thus, combining cytotoxic chemotherapy agents
could enhance sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors and achieve
better outcomes. We first evaluated the baseline sensitivity
of sirolimus (rapamycin) in different acute leukemic
cells lines via the MTT assay. Figure 6A shows that acute
myeloid leukemic cells HL60, MOLM-13, and MV4-11
were more resistant to sirolimus, with IC50 values of 14.02,
10.38, and 7.41 µM, respectively, while comparing with
acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells MOLT-4 and CCRFECM (IC50 values of 0.32 and 0.42 µM, respectively). In

to evaluate the effect of B392 on microtubule dynamics. In cell-free condition, tubulin proteins were in reaction buffer in the presence
or absence of B392 (3 or 10 μM), paclitaxel (10 μM) or vincristine (10 μM). Assembly of microtubules was determined by measuring
absorbance at 340 nm. (B) HL60 cells were exposed to 0.1 μM B392, 10 µM vincristine and 10 µM paclitaxel for 24 h. The changes of

10 µM paclitaxel were used as positive controls for tubulin depolymerization and tubulin polymerization, respectively. (C) HL60 cells were
treated 0.1 μM B392 time-dependently to detect the expressions of G2/M related proteins.

rhodamine-123, a substrate of p-gp, was effluxed, and this
phenomenon was inhibited by co-treatment with verapamil,
a p-gp inhibitor, as observed by the dye retention in the
cells. In contrast, the efflux of rhodamine did not decrease

even after co-incubation with a high concentration of
B392 (10 µM), implying that the intake of B392 was
not interfered by p-gp expression and function in tumor
cells (Figure 7B). Our data suggests that B392 is a strong
microtubule binding agents but not a p-gp substrate.

DISCUSSION

alteration of tubulin and overexpression of members of the
ABC family, of which p-gp is the best known [8]. Several
lines of evidence have revealed that vinca alkaloids and
taxanes are pumped out by the membrane transporter
p-gp, the product of multidrug resistance (MDR) gene
and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP),
thereby decreasing their intracellular concentrations and
efficacy [26–28]. Therefore, after we demonstrated that
B392 is indeed a microtubule destabilizing agent, as
manifested by the result of our in vitro tubulin binding
assay (Figure  3A), we also evaluated the susceptibility
of B392 to p-gp in a p-gp-overexpressed NCI/ADRRES cell line. We showed that NCI/ADR-RES cell was
more sensitive to B392 than to vincristine or paclitaxel
(Figure 7A) and the efflux of rhodamine did not decrease
after co-incubation with a B392 (Figure 7B), implying
that B392 might not be excluded by membrane transporter
p-gp. Furthermore, most FDA-approved MTA for cancer
treatment require parenteral administration; however,
B392 was particularly designed for oral administration.

In this study, we reported a novel oral quinoline
derivative, B392 as a potential drug candidate for
anti-leukemia and multiple drug resistant cells. B392
dramatically inhibited leukemic cells survival; however,
it had less cytotoxicity on normal cells in vitro and
in vivo. The further evidences demonstrated that B392
is a depolymerizing MTA, which caused mitotic arrest.
JNK played an essential mediator in B392-induced
cells apoptosis through mitochondria disruption which
ultimately leading to caspases activation. In addition, in
sirolimus-resistant leukemic cells, B392 enhanced the
cytotoxic effect of sirolimus; and the more importantly, it
is not a substrate of p-gp.
Understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance
to approved MTA, as well as their drawbacks in clinical
therapy, is extremely important for the development of a
promising and potent compound that targets microtubules.
The main cause of MTA drug resistance in cancers is

The xenograft animal model demonstrated that antitumor
efficacy after oral administration of B392 (Figure 2). Thus,
B392 can be considered a potential and promising MTA
for the treatment of leukemia.
We also performed a molecular docking analysis
to identify the binding site of MPT0B392 on tubulin
(Supplementary Figure 4). Tubulin has three main binding
sites, namely colchicine, vincristine, and paclitaxel binding
sites [29]. B392 was docked into each binding site using
an in-house molecular docking tool, iGEMDOCK [30].
The docking results show that MPT0B392 occupied the
colchicine binding site and exhibited the best docking
score. In addition, the binding mode of B392 was
similar to that of colchicine (Supplementary Figure 4).
Both compounds contain the same functional group,
1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene, which is sandwiched by two
hydrophobic residues L248 and L255 and forms stable
van der Waals interactions with the residues. These
observations suggest that B392 binds to the colchicine
binding site and possesses a similar inhibition mechanism
with colchicine.
Cell cycle progression is precisely regulated by
cyclin and cyclin kinase complexes [31]. The activation of
the cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex in the nucleus is responsible
for entry into mitosis from the G2 phase. The observed
upregulation of cyclin B1, decrease of phosphorylated
Cdc2 at Tyr-15, and the phosphorylation of MPM2
demonstrated that B392 induced mitotic arrest and not G2
phase arrest (Figure 1D, 3C). In mitosis, if a chromosome
attaches incorrectly to microtubule, the metaphase
checkpoint (also called spindle assembly checkpoint,
SAC) would be activated to elicit signal cascades to
inhibit the APC, which causes cyclin B1 degradation and
results in cells exiting mitosis [32]. In the present study,
we found that after treatment with B392, the expression of
Aurora A and Aurora B increased, and their downstream
target H3S10 was phosphorylated, implying that B392
disrupted microtubule formation and might lead to SAC
activation (Figure 3C). However, not every cancer cell
with prolonged mitosis undergo apoptosis [33]. Antiapoptotic mitochondrial proteins, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and BclxL, have been shown to be critical factors involved in the
MTA-induced apoptosis pathway [34]. Knockdown of
Mcl-1 can sensitize cells to spindle poison treatment [35]
and overexpression of phospho-defective mutant Bcl-2
can block mitotic death [36]. In the present study, we
found that B392 induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation and Mcl1 decrease, which contributed to mitochondrial membrane
potential loss, and caspase activation, indicating that B392
has actual cytotoxic abilities and does not merely increase
cellular progression through mitosis.
Three MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and p38, have been
found to be stress inducible in maintenance of cell
functions. ERK was initially associated with cell
proliferation and survival, whereas JNK and p38 were
considered stress-inducible with effects on apoptosis.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

However, the mechanisms underlying MAPK regulation of
apoptosis are complex and controversial, and might depend
on cell type and drugs [23, 37]. Bcl-2, phosphorylated and
inactivated by the JNK pathway, is normally activated in
G2/M phase [38]. Therefore, we investigated to determine
the specific MAPK that contributes to B392-induced
apoptosis. Figure 5 shows that JNK inactivation can
reverse B392-induced phosphorylation of Bcl2, decrease
in Mcl-1, cell cycle distribution, and PARP and cleavage
caspase 3. These imply that B392-induced JNK activation
triggers the apoptotic pathway in leukemic cell lines.
Because mTOR signaling has proved to be crucial
to cell proliferation and survival in hematological
malignancies, mTOR inhibitors are being investigated in
a myriad of preclinical and clinical trials [39]. However,
the results of clinical studies suggest that some cancers
have intrinsic resistance against these agents, while some
have acquired resistance [40, 41]. According to our results,
AML cell lines (HL60, MOLM-13, and MV4-11) show
relative resistant to sirolimus when compared with ALL
cell lines (MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM) (Figure 6A). The
synergism of B392 and sirolimus co-treatment was only
observed in AML cell line (Figure 6B; Supplementary
Table 1). It was reported that almost all AML samples
have been observed to contain activated mTOR1, which is
independent of PI3K/AKT [25]. Inhibition of mTOR1 by
sirolimus would overactivate PI3K/AKT, thus producing
AML cell resistance to sirolimus. It was also noted that
downregulation of Mcl-1, a prosurvival member of the
Bcl-2 family, can overcome resistance to sirolimus [42].
p-AKT and Mcl-1 expression decreased dramatically after
B392 and sirolimus co-treatment (Figure 6C). Therefore,
we hypothesized that the mechanism underlying this
synergistic combination in AML cells might involve
the inhibition of multiple pathways. Crazzolara. et al
demonstrated that everolimus-vincristine co-treatment
prolonged the survival of mice engrafted with ALL
cells [43]. However, the combination of sirolimus and
B392 had no effect on the ALL cell line, MOLT-4, in our
in vitro study. We suggested that there might be more
complicated mechanisms or factors influenced by the
microenvironment that lead to this diversity.
Acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic
leukemia is a kind of high and poor risk leukemia,
containing many subtypes based on distinct and
complicated cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities,
in contrast to chronic leukemia. Although conventional
microtubule targeting drugs are regarded as an outdated
chemotherapy, it cannot be denied that they can still
have an impact on current anticancer therapy, as long
as their deficiencies are improved. In the present study,
we developed a novel oral quinoline derivative B392,
that has an ability to inhibit tubulin polymerization and
induce leukemic cell apoptosis though JNK activation. It
is also less susceptible to p-gp activity, and enhances the
cytotoxicity of sirolimus in sirolimus-resistant cells. Thus,

In vitro tubulin polymerization assay

B392 is considered a potential drug for the treatment of
acute leukemia and multiple drug resistant cancers.

Tubulin polymerization assay was conducted by using
CytoDYNAMIX screen 03 kit (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver,
CO, USA). All steps were followed by manufacturer’s
protocol. Before preparing tubulin polymerization
(TP) buffer, a 96 well-plate was pre-warmed in the
Spectrophotometer at 37°C. TP buffer (including General
Tubulin Buffer, Tubulin Glycerol Buffer and GTP), 85 µL/
well and the test drugs (2 µL/well) were added to the prewarmed 96-well plate, respectively. Here, DMSO was used
for control, paclitaxel and vincristine for positive controls.
Tubulin proteins were immediately added to the mixture
(30 µL/well). The absorbance, 340 nm, were recorded every
1 min for 30 min at 37°C by ELISA reader (SpectraMAX
Plus; Molecular Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and biochemical regents
HL60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia), MOLT-4
(acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and CCRF-CEM
(acute lymphoblastic leukemia), BEAS (normal human
bronchial epithelium) and HUVEC (Human umbilical vein
endothelial cell) were purchased from BCRC (Bioresource
Collection and Research Centre, Taiwan); NCI/ADR-RES
(National Cancer Institute/Adriamycin-Resistant, human
ovarian carcinoma cell line) was obtained from the DTP
Human Tumor Cell Line Screen; MV4-11(acute myeloid
leukemia cell) and MOLM-13 (acute myeloid leukemia
cell) were kindly gifted from National Health Research
Institutes. HL60, MOLT-4, CCRF-CEM, BEAS, MV411, MOLM-13 and NCI/ADR-RES were maintained in
RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
FBS. HUVEC were grown in endothelial cell medium
(ECM) (ScienCell Research Laboratory, Carlsbad, CA)
supplemented with 20% FBS. All cell lines were incubated
in 5% CO2 at 37°C. B392 was synthetized from Prof. JingPing Liou (Taipei Medical University), and the purity is
over 98%. Paclitaxel and vincristine were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All of the above drugs were
reconstituted in dimethysulfoxide (DMSO).

Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded in round slide glass, pre-coated
with poly-L-lysine, and treated with drugs for 24 h. Cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with
1% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% BSA and then incubated
with α-tubulin primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) overnight. In the next day, cells were washed with
PBS and probed with appropriate secondary antibody for
1 h at RT (room temperature). Finally, cells were stained
with mounting gel which contains DAPI then sealed with
nail oil. Images were captured with the ZEISS, LSM 510
META confocal microscope.

Cell viability

Tumor xenograft models

The MTT (3- (4,5-cimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide) assay was used to determine cell
viability. The mitochondrial dehydrogenase of viable cells
reduced 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide, MTT (yellow) to insoluble formazan dyes (purple).
Cells were seeded in 24-well (4 × 105 cells/well) and then
treated with B392 in 10% FBS-culture medium for 24 and
48 h. 100 µL mg/mL MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL in PBS)
was added to the 24-well and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The
dyes were solubilized in the extraction buffer (0.1 M sodium
acetate buffer, 100 mL/well). Finally, the absorbance (550
nm) was measured by spectrophotometer.

To evaluate in vivo antitumor activity of B392,
MOLT-4 or HL60 cells (107/mice) were injected into severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice subcutaneously.
The following experiments were referenced by our published
paper [18]. Mice were treated with indicated dosage of B392
and vincristine orally or intraperitoneally, when the average
tumor size reached 100 mm3. The in vivo solvents of B392
and vincristine are 1% CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) with
0.1% Tween 80 and 50% Cremophor EL with 50% DMSO,
respectively. Body weights and tumor sizes were measured
twice a week. The animal studies terminated when average
size of the tumor was greater than 2,500 mm3. Tumor size
was measured by caliper measurement (mm) and ellipsoid
sphere formula (LW2/2, L: length; W: width). All procedures
followed ethical standards and have been approved by
National Taiwan University Animal Use and Management
Committee (IACUC number: 20110303).

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were seeded in six-well plates (8 × 105/well)
and treated with the drugs for the indicated time. Cells
were collected, washed with PBS and fixed in 70% EtOH
at –20°C for at least 30 min. Then cells were washed
with PBS, treated with DNA extraction (0.2 M Na2HPO40.1M citritic buffer, pH 7.8) for 20 min and finally stained
with propidium iodide (PI) solution (0.1% Triton X-100,
RNAase A and PI) for 20 min. DNA contents were analyzed
by flow cytometry using FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences).

slides were stained with the primary antibody cleavage
caspase 3 or hematoxylin and eosin staining. HP-polymer
conjugated secondary antibody (SuperPicture Polymer
Detection kit) was used and then sectioned slides were
stained with DAB Chomogen for 5 min. Mayer’s
Hematoxylin solution was used for counterstaining. Other
sectioned slides in the same tissues were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), the color of nuclei was
blue and of cytoplasm was pink.

Rhodamine-123 for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were trpsinized,
washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS
Calibur, BD Biosciences).

Statistical analysis
All experimental data were repeated at least three
times and expressed as means (± SD). Statistical analysis
was evaluated by student t-test, which was calculated to
compare the mean of each group with that of the control
group. P-values < 0.05 were represented statistical
significance (*P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).

Western blot analysis
Cells were treated with drugs for indicated time
and collected, washed with PBS. Pellets were lysed with
RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors and under sonication.
The supernatants were harvested. Protein concentrations
were determined by BCA kit (Thermo Fisher scientific,
Waltham, MA). The equal amounts of protein were loaded
onto a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (SDSPAGE) gel then transferred to polyvinylidene difluorid
(PVDF) membrane. The membranes were blocked for
1 h with 5% non-fat milk and probed with the primary
antibodies of interest overnight at 4°C. The next day
membranes were washed with TBST (Tris Buffered
Saline with Tween® 20) and subsequently incubated with
appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies 1 h at RT. The antibody used in this study as
follows : Cdc2 (pY15), Aurora B, caspase-8, caspase-9,
p-mTOR, t-mTOR, p-AKT, t-AKT, p-P70S6K, P70S6K,
