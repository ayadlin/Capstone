ABSTRACT
Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. To date, therapies do not
allow curing patients, and glioblastomas (GBMs) are associated with remarkably poor
prognosis. This situation is at least partly due to intrinsic or acquired resistance to
treatment, especially to chemotherapy. In 2005, temozolomide (TMZ) has become the
first chemotherapeutic drug validated for GBM. Nevertheless TMZ efficacy depends
on Mgmt status. While the methylation of Mgmt promoter was considered so far as
a prognostic marker, its targeting is becoming an effective therapeutic opportunity.
Thus, arrival of both TMZ and Mgmt illustrated that considerable progress can still
be realized by optimizing adjuvant chemotherapy. A part of this progress could be
accomplished in the future by overcoming residual resistance. The aim of the present
study was to investigate the involvement of a set of other DNA-repair genes in glioma
resistance to temozolomide. We focused on DNA-repair genes located in the commonly
deleted chromosomal region in oligodendroglioma (1p/19q) highly correlated with
patient response to chemotherapy. We measured effects of inhibition of ten DNArepair genes expression using siRNAs on astrocytoma cell response to cisplatin (CDDP)
and TMZ. SiRNAs targeting ercc1, ercc2, mutyh, and pnkp significantly sensitized
cells to chemotherapy, increasing cell death by up to 25%. In vivo we observed a
decrease of subcutaneous glioma tumor growth after injection of siRNA in conjunction
with absorption of TMZ. We demonstrated in this pre-clinical study that targeting of
DNA-repair genes such as Ercc1 could be used as an adjuvant chemosensitization
treatment, similarly to Mgmt inhibition.

to 5% of patients survive after 2 years [4]. These gliomas
are indeed highly refractory to any treatment.
Since the publication of the phase III study
initiated by the European Organisation for Research and
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the National Cancer
Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG)
groups in 2005, standard treatment is surgery followed
by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ)-based
chemotherapy [5]. Concomitant radiotherapy and TMZ
administration has significantly improved median survival
of glioma patients, from 12.1 to 14.6 months, with 27%
of patients alive at 2 years, instead of 10% without TMZ
[6]. This improvement was confirmed during the five-year

INTRODUCTION
Malignant gliomas are the most common type of
primary tumors of the central nervous system in Europe
and US, accounting for 80% of patients [1, 2]. Annual
incidence of these neoplasms is approximately 4–7
per 100,000 in men and 3–5 in women. The number of
patients is expected to increase in industrialized countries
as the population ages. Tumor diagnoses are based on
histopathological features and are graded according to
the World Health Organization classification [3]. Among
them, glioblastomas multiform (GBM) are the most
frequent, and harbor the poorest prognosis [1, 2] as only 2

follow-up period with a median survival of 9.8% versus
1.9% [7]. The benefit offered by TMZ has been established
in a systematic review [8]. Nevertheless, malignant
gliomas prognosis remains poor and most of the patients
relapse, thus there is a clear need for new treatments.
Some glioma hallmarks were demonstrated to
be of clinical relevance and may offer opportunities for
new therapies. Among them, some are responsible for a
poorer prognosis (mutation/amplification of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) [9, 10]). and, on the
other hand, some others are associated with a better one
(O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
promoter methylation [11], mutations in isocitrate
dehydrogenase (IDH) genes [12] and 1p/19q deletion [13]) .
The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of these chromosomal
arms was indeed correlated with the oligodendroglioma
noticeable chemosensitivity [13, 14], suggesting that some
key genes involved in chemosensitivity may be located on
this area.
This fact consequently provides a list of more than
1,700 putative target genes to increase glioma sensitivity
to chemotherapy, and among them some of the 150 DNArepair genes inventoried by Wood et al. [15].
Prior to 2005, GBM patients had been treated
for decades with chemotherapy agents. The failure of
these drugs showed that intrinsic or acquired resistance
mechanisms are of paramount importance in these high
grade tumors. Since most drugs were alkylating agents,
inducing a panel of DNA damages, DNA repair is a
highly relevant resistance mechanism. Moreover, the
DNA repair gene Mgmt was shown to be associated to
patients’ outcome when treated with TMZ [11]. Mgmt was
considered as a prognostic marker as well as a therapeutic
opportunity [16]. Unfortunately, targeting Mgmt activity
using chemical inhibitor O6BG was first associated with
a crippling hematopoietic toxicity [17, 18]. Yet innovative
strategies have emerged, allowing for reduction of side

effects and transforming the hypothesis into medical
practice [19].
We proposed the hypothesis that other DNA-repair
genes would be involved in glioma resistance to
TMZ. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) we
found that inhibition of 4 of them, namely ercc1,
ercc2, mutyh and pnkp, showed a significant impact
on cisplatin (CDDP) and/or TMZ cytotoxic effect
in several human glioma cell lines. Furthermore, an
ercc-1 siRNA-based adjuvant treatment was able to
improve the efficacy of TMZ in glioma tumor bearing
mice. This study offers a promising adjuvant therapy
to improve the clinical management of malignant
gliomas.

RESULTS
In silico identification of candidate genes
To select genes potentially involved in glioblastoma
chemoresistance, the chromosomal areas commonly
considered as correlated with oligodendroglioma chemosensitivity (1p36–1p32 and 19q13.2–19q13.4; [20]) were
screened, using databases on the web (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/PubMed/; http://www.ensembl.org; http://www.
cgal.icnet.uk/DNA_Repair_Genes.html; Supplementary to
the paper by Wood, 2005) and published data [15, 21, 22].
Nine genes located in these regions belong to different
DNA-repair systems among the 1,700 genes (Table 1).

Screening of DNA-repair genes involved in
chemoresistance of astrocytoma cells
The in vitro part of the project was developed as a
3-stage strategy. SiRNAs targeting candidate genes were
screened on one cell line (U373). We chose to achieve
this step using CDDP because Ercc1 is associated with a

chemotherapy resistance (especially to platinum drugs) in
several experimental models (see discussion). Then, the
study was extended to six astrocytoma-derived cell lines
and validated at the molecular level. Finally, the study was
expanded to TMZ. Nine DNA-repair genes were screened
on the U373 cell line with up to 5 different siRNAs per
gene (Table 1). Cell viability was measured in the absence
and presence of CDDP. SiRNAs were selected on the
basis of two criteria: the absence of basal toxicity and
their ability to improve chemotherapy treatment. SiRNAs
inducing more than 35% cell death in absence of drug
were considered as toxic and discarded. On the other
hand, those increasing sensitivity to the chemotherapy
drug were retained. An siRNA was considered as
chemosensitizing when its chemoresistance index (CI)
was lower than the GFP siRNA’s CI (0.5). In Figure 1,
the white square corresponds to siRNAs with low toxicity
and chemosensitization properties. Nine siRNAs out of
46 matched with these criteria, corresponding to 6 genes:
ercc1, ercc2, mutyh, pnkp, ruvbl2 and pold1.

Highlighted genes were further analyzed to validate
preliminary screening, using only the most efficient
siRNA for each gene. The experiments were extended
to 5 other cell lines and we confirmed that 4 siRNAs,
ercc1#2, ercc2#1, mutyh#5 and pnkp#1, had significant
chemosensitization effects (Table 2). Inhibition of ercc1
was the most effective in sensitizing cells to CDDP
(up to 24.9%). Moreover, its effect was the most
widespread since 4 out of the 6 cell lines were sensitized.
The knock-down induced by the 3 other siRNAs was
equally effective (up to 17%) but only on 2 (mutyh and
pnkp) or 3 (ercc2) cell lines.
In order to validate these effects at molecular level,
siRNA-induced down-regulation of the mRNAs was
measured (Table 3). The target specificity was confirmed
by the absence of an effect on either cyclophiline A or
other gene expression (data not shown). There was
no obvious link between the efficiency of siRNA in
decreasing mRNA levels (nor with residual mRNA
content; data not shown) and functional impact on cell

(5.10−6 M). SiRNA (150 nM) inducing less than 35% of cell death without drug, and a chemosensitization were selected for further analyses.

Sensitization to temozolomide

DISCUSSION

Since TMZ is the gold standard in chemotherapy for
gliomas, the study was extended to this drug using GHD
and U373 cell lines. All siRNAs sensitized U373 cells to
both CDDP and TMZ with a similar efficacy (Figure 2).
The siRNAs were less efficient on GHD cells treated with
TMZ compared to CDDP and only the effects of the ercc1
siRNA remained statistically significant (data not shown).

Despite the demonstration of the improvement in
survival following radio- and chemotherapy regimens
(TMZ) for glioblastoma, this malignancy remains an
incurable disease.
A variety of cancer cell resistance mechanisms
have been described, including decreased drug uptake,
increased drug efflux, intracellular drug inactivation
or drug-induced damage repair. The high activity of
these mechanisms in gliomas have hampered the use
of chemotherapy and thereby prevented widespread its
acceptance as an effective treatment modality. Most
chemotherapy drugs commonly employed in the past such

as the PCV regimen (Procarbazine, Lomustine (CCNU),
and Vincristine), CDDP, fotemustine or the presently
used TMZ are DNA-alkylating molecules which damage
DNA. These data have led many studies to focus on the
link between DNA-repair and chemoresistance [23–26].
However it is only recently that the response to TMZ was
found strongly correlated with mgmt promoter methylation
status [11]. Down-regulation of Mgmt expression would
explain sensitivity to therapy due to the absence of
alkylating adducts repair. Mgmt is considered as a major
DNA-repair enzyme involved in resistance to several
chemotherapy drugs since the end of the twentieth century
[27]. Hegi et al. have shown a correlation between the
DNA-repair gene mgmt and response to TMZ [11]. Indeed,
several clinical trials have addressed the possibility of
increasing chemotherapy efficacy while blocking mgmt
activity [28–31]. Using an innovative strategy, Adair et al.
have recently demonstrated that Mgmt blockade is
associated with an improvement of TMZ efficacy [19].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Although these results are preliminary with a small cohort
of patients, they consist of the first dual clinical and
functional demonstration of the link between Mgmt and
TMZ resistance. These results indicate that DNA-repair
inhibition is a highly attractive and plausible therapeutic
avenue.
Thus Mgmt is to date the main molecular pathway
related to TMZ response in glioblastoma.
As discussed above, the decrease in mgmt
expression has often been reported, as a consequence of
its promoter methylation. In this study, we observed both
that siRNAs were responsible for a decrease of expression
and a chemosensitizing impact. Similar observations were
made using a second siRNA duplex (data not shown). Our
results suggest that mgmt expression was sufficient for
supporting a significant DNA repair activity.
As discussed below, we demonstrated that targeting
other DNA-repair genes can provide similar efficacy
compared to Mgmt invalidation.

chemotherapy. Thanks to its nuclease activity, the ercc1
protein plays a crucial role in the early excision step of
damaged DNA [34, 35]. It is involved in CDDP-induced
adduct repair in vitro [36, 37]. Reduction of its expression
enhances CDDP cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cell
lines [38, 39], and was generally found involved in drug
resistance of cultured cells [40, 41].
Moreover, its expression or polymorphisms were
correlated with stage or clinical outcome in several
cancers e.g. glioma [42], stomach [43], ovary [44] and
lung [45, 46], (for review, see: [47, 48]). Thus, it appears
as a very consistent if not universal component of tumor
drug resistance and thus as a spread diagnostic/prognostic
marker and/or therapeutic target.
Ercc2 expression was correlated with resistance to
alkylating compounds in numerous cell lines [49, 50],
including glioma cell lines [51], but no link has been
established between this expression and NER activity
[50]. This suggests that ercc2 is not an NER rate-limiting
enzyme as in primary lymphocytes [52]. It could also act
via the homologous recombination repair system as in
SKMG-4 glioma cells [53]. Another level of complexity
is the number of ercc2 polymorphisms without clear
associated phenotypes [54]. These polymorphisms
obviously contribute to governing ercc2 cellular function.
So, while a previous report showed that its overexpression
increased DNA repair in a glioma cell line [55], the
present results are the first demonstration of its functional
involvement in drug resistance.
We also found two genes belonging to the BER
system: mutyh and pnkp. Only the systematic bioinformatics analysis prompted us to analyze them, as no
previous publication involved them in chemosensitivity.
Mutyh is known to repair 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro2′­
deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) caused by oxidation. Gene
mutations and variants were associated with development
of multiple colorectal adenomas and cancers [56].
This is the first time that mutyh has been implicated in
chemosensitivity, warranting further studies to investigate
its mechanisms of action.
Pnkp was shown to be involved in repairing
DNA strand breaks caused by reactive oxygen species,
ionizing radiation or alkylating agents [57, 58]. It has
been related to susceptibility to genotoxic agents but not
to chemosensitivity [59]. Nevertheless, interactions of
pnkp with another DNA-repair protein such as Xrcc1,
which is related to tumoral processes, could account for
our results [60].

In contrast to glioblastomas, oligodendrogliomas
constitute a chemoresponsive entity. The correlation
between 1p/19q LOH and oligodendroglioma chemosens­
itivity [13] prompted us to perform an in silico analysis
of these chromosomal areas in order to identify genes
potentially involved in chemosensitivity. Jenkins et al.
demonstrated that 1p/19q LOH was mediated by a
translocation [32]. This early cytogenetic event was also
associated with a longer overall survival. These data led
to a better understanding of the cytogenetic alterations
mechanisms frequently associated. But, above all, they
reinforce the hypothesis that expression of genes located
in both regions can be altered, being finally responsible for
chemosensitivity of oligodendroglioma.
Among the 1,700 genes located on the 1p and 19q
chromosomal areas commonly considered as correlated
with oligodendroglioma chemosensitivity, we found 9
DNA-repair genes. We confirmed the in silico analysis
with a functional genomic approach using siRNAs to
knock down gene expression, mimicking LOH.

In vitro study
For validating candidates at functional level, we
developed an adequate in vitro chemosensitivity assay
in 96-well plates to test all the designed siRNA. The
temporal sequence of treatments was crucial since the
siRNA impact on DNA repair activity had to line up with
the chemotherapy treatment. We succeeded in interfering
with drug-induced DNA adduct repair using an siRNA
transfection performed 24 hours prior to chemotherapy.
This result is consistent with data previously published by
Parker et al. showing that drug effect occurs in the first
6 hours of treatment [33].
SiRNAs found to induce cellular toxicity were
discarded from the study to prevent erroneous conclusions.
The observed toxicity could be the result of a critical
gene inhibition and, though possibly interesting, it would
have masked any intended chemosensitization. Similarly,
siRNAs that did not have any impact on cell numeration
were rejected. In the end, only 9 out of the 46 tested
sequences in this study had a significant chemosensitivity
impact, demonstrating the importance of a validated assay
to bring out efficient siRNA targets.
The most prominent functional impact was observed
with the two most studied genes of the NER system: ercc1
and ercc2, a.k.a. xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD).
The NER system has a critical role in repairing DNA and
has been extensively studied in cancer cells.
The most important chemosensitization occurred
when ercc1 expression was inhibited: Sensitization was
not larger but was found in a greater number of cell
lines (4 vs 3 for ercc2, and 2 for mutyh and pnkp). These
results emphasize previous reports on the major role of
ercc1 in repairing DNA alterations related to alkylating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Heterogeneity
We observed heterogeneity in responses to
siRNAs among the 6 cell lines. While no siRNA
improved chemotherapeutic effects on CCF and U87, all
siRNAs sensitized U373 to both CDDP and TMZ. Such
heterogeneous results were already observed for glioma
cell lines in an unrelated study [61]. These differences
29462

were not related to known differences in cytogenetic
or genetic status e.g. p53 mutations. Heterogeneity
in cell line response to siRNAs may result from the
strong variability in gene expression. However, we
did not find any correlation between the mRNA levels
(in basal or CDDP conditions) and the siRNAs’ ability
to chemosensitize. Such a correlation was not either
found for Mgmt. Indeed, while the methylation status
of the promoter is a routinely used marker of response
to TMZ, Mgmt expression failed to be as useful [62]. It
is important to note that among cell lines with opposite
behaviors, U373 and U87 are the most frequently
used for studying gliomas, as shown by the number of
publications (search «glioma»» and «U87» or «U373»
or «U138» or «LN229» or «CCF»: 1,534; 513; 63; 127;
94 respectively on Pubmed in March 2015). Thus, no cell
line can be sufficiently representative for constituting an
in vitro model, and results obtained with only one cell
line should be considered very cautiously for clinical
applications.

fetal calf serum (v/v; AbCys, Paris, France). Cells were
maintained in 5% CO2 at 37°C in a humidified incubator.
Since the experiments were performed the ATCC
found that the U251 and U373 cell lines had a common
origin [68]. We then cannot be sure of the cell-line we
actually worked on. Nevertheless, both cell-lines derived
from glioblastomas.
The GHD cell line was obtained in our laboratory
from a human glioblastoma (genotype was checked
with fluorescence in situ hybridization and con­
tained chromosome 7 polysomy and chromosome 10
monosomy).

Inhibition of gene expression by siRNA
SiRNAs (three to five per gene) were designed
(Table 4) and delivered in duplex form (Eurogentec,
Belgium). SiRNA targeting Green Fluorescent Protein
(GFP) were used as a control. In vivo-jetPEI® was from
Polyplus-transfection (Illkirch, France)
For in vitro experiments, cells were transfected
with siRNA duplexes at a concentration of 150 nM in
the culture medium by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen,
Cergy-Pontoise, France) 24 h after cell seeding according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each condition
(siRNA) was tested in 3 independent experiments, with
six replicates each time.
For in vivo delivery, siRNA were diluted in 5%
glucose (final) using 4 μl of glucose stock solution per μg
of siRNA. 0.1 μl of in vivo-jetPEI® were used per μg of
siRNA, and were diluted in the same volume of glucose
stock solution. The transfection reagent solution was
added to the siRNA solution and incubated for 15 min
at room temperature. The mixture was diluted in 200 μl
(final) of water.

SiRNA
The delivery of drugs to the central nervous system
(CNS) is a crucial issue in medical management. We and
others have demonstrated the poor capacity of siRNAs
packaged with polyethylenimine (PEI) to pass through
the blood brain barrier [63–65] and among the numerous
other vectors or strategies investigated for targeting
brain and intracranial tumors, none has been validated to
date. This is the reason why we chose to use ectopically
implanted tumor instead of intracranial ones. As a second
consequence of using siRNAs in this study, our results
cannot be easily transferred to bedside in absence of a
validated procedure at the clinical level. Novel chemical
agents may be developed that will enable translation of
this technique to clinical practice. Indeed, the Ercc1XPF interaction can be successfully prevented in vitro
[66, 67], providing hope for future clinical use. But the
development of chemical inhibitors directed to Ercc2,
Mutyh and Pnkp proteins is needed.
The aim of our study was to elucidate a part of the
mechanisms of astrocytoma drug resistance. We have
identified and functionally validated that Ercc1, Ercc2,
Mutyh and Pnkp participate to TMZ resistance in gliomas.
Our results suggest that survival of glioma patients may be
improved when targeting these genes.

Evaluation of siRNA effect on drug sensitivity
We developed an in vitro assay designed to
screen siRNAs. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates.
SiRNAs (150nM) were transfected the second day. The
next day, cells were treated with drugs: CDDP (5.10−6
M) (Merck, NJ, USA) or TMZ (10 mg/ml) (ScheringPlough, Levallois-Perret, France) and post-incubated
with a drug-free medium for 96 hours. Cell survival was
then evaluated by measuring mitochondrial succinate
dehydrogenase activity with 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma; 0.5 mg/
ml) added to the culture medium. Culture medium was
discarded after 4 h and formazan crystals were dissolved
in DMSO/ethanol (50/50). Optical density (OD) was read
at 540 nm.
Chemoresistance was related to an index (CI)
corresponding to the proportion of a cell population that
survived chemotherapy. It was computed as follows: cell
number (OD) with chemotherapy / cell number (OD)
in control condition. The benefit of transfection was

represented by the siRNA-induced drug sensitization
index (DS), which corresponds to the cell population
(%) that survived a simple chemotherapy treatment but
died in response to the same treatment following siRNA
transfection. It was computed as follows: (CI siRNA GFP –
CI siRNA X) /CI siRNA GFP × 100. Standard errors of this index
were computed using a bootstrap, technique implemented
in the boot library [69] in R [70]. Significant differences
between series were tested by ANOVA using Statview
(SAS institute). Differences were considered significant

Human xenografts assays
The U373 glioma cells (ATCC, MD, USA) were
subcutaneously implanted one week after the mice arrival.
A 100 μL solution containing 0.75 × 106 U373 cells in
DMEM were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the upper
leg of nude mice (Charles River). When tumors are visible,
mice were randomized into groups of 6 mice each. Ercc1,
Mgmt or GFP siRNA were injected daily into the peritoneal
cavity of each mouse on Days 20–29 (4 μg siRNA in 5%
final Glucose 200 μL of H20). TMZ treatment began on the
5th siRNA administration day. It was orally administrated
daily for 5 days at a dose of 4.2 mg/kg in 200 μL of
orange juice. Tumors were measured every other day
with a dial caliper. Results are presented as the mean ± SE
with significance calculated by 2-tailed Student’s t test.
Significance was assigned for a p-value < 0.05.
