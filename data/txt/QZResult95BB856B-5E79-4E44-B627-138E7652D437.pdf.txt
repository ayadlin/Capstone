ABSTRACT:
TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis through
its death receptors (DRs) 4 and/or 5 expressed on the surface of target cells.
The selectivity of TRAIL towards cancer cells has promoted clinical evaluation of
recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) and its agonistic antibodies in treating several
major human cancers including colon and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. However, little
is known about their ability in killing oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. In
this study, we tested the apoptotic responses of a panel of seven human OSCC cell
lines (HN31, HN30, HN12, HN6, HN4, Cal27, and OSCC3) to rhTRAIL and monoclonal
antibodies against DR4 or DR5. We found that rhTRAIL is a potent inducer of apoptosis
in most of the oral cancer cell lines tested both in vitro and in vivo. We also showed
that DR5 was expressed on the surface of the tested cell lines which correlated with
the cellular susceptibility to apoptosis induced by rhTRAIL and anti-DR5 antibody.
By contrast, little or no DR4 was detected on the surface of OSCC3 and HN6 cells
rendering cellular resistance to DR4 antibody and a reduced sensitivity to rhTRAIL.
Notably, the overall TRAIL sensitivity correlated well with the levels of endogenous
active Ras in the cell lines tested. Expression of a constitutively active Ras mutant
(RasV12) in OSCC3 cells selectively upregulated surface expression of DR5, but not
DR4, and restored TRAIL sensitivity. Our findings could have implications for the
use of TRAIL receptor targeted therapies in the treatment of human OSCC tumors
particularly the ones harboring constitutively active Ras mutant.

INTRODUCTION

induces apoptosis through its death receptors (DRs)
4 and/ 5 expressed on the surface of target cells. Both
receptors are characterized by a cytoplasmic death domain
that, upon ligand binding, facilitates the assembly of the
death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) involving
procaspase-8 or -10 [6, 7]. Within the DISC, procaspase-8
or -10 is self-cleaved and activated, resulting in subsequent
activation of a caspase cascade, cleavage of cellular
proteins, and eventually apoptotic cell death. Preclinical
data indicate that recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL)
can induce apoptosis in a broad range of human cancer
cell lines while sparing most normal cell types [8-11].
In tumor xenograft models, rhTRAIL exhibits single-

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the
most common oral and pharyngeal cancer that affects
approximately 500,000 new cases annually worldwide [1,
2]. Despite the aggressive management including surgery,
radiation, and chemotherapy [3], most patients with
advanced OSCC develop local or regional recurrences and
distant metastasis that accounts for a poor prognosis that
has remained unchanged for decades [4, 5]. There is an
unmet need for more effective and less toxic molecularly
targeted therapies for treating this disease.

agent antitumor activity and/or cooperation with certain
conventional and targeted therapies [11-14]. These unique
properties of TRAIL have promoted multiple clinical
trials that are currently ongoing to test rhTRAIL and
monoclonal antibodies to DR4 or DR5 for the treatment
of various malignancies, including melanoma, ovarian,
renal, and colorectal cancers [15, 16]. However, several
issues remain to be resolved such as the identification of
tumor types that are mostly susceptible to TRAIL based
therapies, and the detection of biomarkers predictive
of tumor sensitivity. Indeed, little is known about the
apoptosis-inducing activity of rhTRAIL and its agonistic
antibodies in OSCC cells.
The utility of TRAIL as a cancer therapy is limited
by the development of drug resistance in cancer cells.
Many factors have been reported to affect TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, including decoy receptors DcR1, DcR2 and
OPG that lack a death domain but compete with DR4/
DR5 for TRAIL binding, the expression of inhibitory
proteins in signal transduction pathways such as c-FLICEinhibitory protein (FLIP) [17] and IAP family proteins
[18], and deficiency in caspase-8 [19]. We and others have
recently shown that the post-translational modifications of
DR4 and DR5 receptors, including O-glycosylation [20]
and endocytosis [21-23], are also a critical determinant
of cellular sensitivity to TRAIL based therapies. Recent
evidence suggests that oncogenic Ras may also be
involved in the regulation of TRAIL receptors, thereby
sensitizing cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
[24-26]. Ras signaling is often activated in human
tumors including OSCC [27-29], where it contributes
to the tumorigenicity through interaction with various
downstream effector targets, such as MEK, PI3K, and
Rho GTPases [30, 31]. Ras regulates a Raf-MEK-ERK1/2
kinase cascade which has been shown to sensitize colon
cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by up-regulating
DR4 and DR5 [24, 25]. TRAIL resistance is also seen in
OSCC cell lines [32-35], and the underlying mechanisms
remain to be better understood.
To explore the potential of targeting death receptors
against OSCC, we tested the apoptosis-inducing activity of
rhTRAIL and its agonistic antibodies in a panel of OSCC
cell lines. We found a positive association between TRAIL
sensitivity, surface expression of DR4 and DR5, and the
levels of activated Ras, with the TRAIL-resistant cell lines
OSCC3 being found to be of the lowest levels of surface
DR4/DR5 and Ras activity. Interestingly, transfection of
OSCC3 cells with a constitutively Ras mutant specifically
increased the surface expression of DR5, but not DR4,
and sensitized the cells to DR5 monoclonal antibody
and rhTRAIL-induced apoptosis. The results suggest
that rhTRAIL and its agonistic antibodies could be used
in cases of human OSCC tumors bearing activated Ras
pathways.

TRAIL is a potent inducer of apoptosis in some
oral cancer cell lines.
To assess the ability of TRAIL in killing OSCC
cancer cells, we first determined cell viability in a panel
of seven representative human oral cancer cell lines. As
shown in Fig. 1A, TRAIL induced a dose-dependent
decrease in cell viability in all the cell lines tested although
the sensitivity is different. HN4, HN31 and HN30 showed
the highest sensitivity to rhTRAIL whereas only minimal
cytotoxicity was detected in OSCC3 and Cal27 cells. The
difference in TRAIL sensitivity was further supported
by flow cytometry assays, demonstrating differential
apoptotic responses to rhTRAIL between the cell lines.
At a concentration as low as 10 ng/mL of rhTRAIL, HN4,
HN31 and HN30 cell lines underwent rapid and substantial
apoptosis indicated by Annexin V binding (Fig. 1B and C)
and activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 and cleavage
of a caspase substrate PARP (Fig. 1D). By contrast, other
cell lines had modest to little apoptosis in response to
rhTRAIL treatment. These results indicate that rhTRAIL
is a potent inducer of apoptosis in certain OSCC cell lines.

TRAIL-sensitive cells are susceptible to agonistic
antibodies to DR4 and DR5.
Next, we tested the cellular responses to the
agonist antibodies against DR4 or DR5. The results
showed that TRAIL-sensitive cell lines (HN31, HN30
and HN4) were selectively sensitive to both DR4 and
DR5 monoclonal antibodies (Figs. 2A & 2B), which
correlated with the extent of apoptosis (Figs. 2C & 2D)
in the corresponding samples. Anti-DR5 antibody also
induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in HN6, HN12
and OSCC3 lines (Fig. 2B & 2D). However, anti-DR4
antibody showed a different cytotoxicity profile where
it induced apoptosis in all five cell lines, but not HN6
(Fig. 2A & 2C). The resistance of HN6 cells persisted at
higher concentrations of anti-DR4 up to 100 µg/mL (data
not shown). Nevertheless, these results demonstrate a
significant number of OSCC cell lines that are susceptible
to both rhTRAIL and its agonistic antibodies. The results
warrant additional studies to assess the potential utility of
TRAIL receptor targeted biologic agents in the treatment
of oral squamous cell carcinomas.

In vivo antitumor activity of TRAIL.
To determine the in vivo activity of rhTRAIL, we
established an orthotopic tumor xenograft model of OSCC
using HN31 cells as described previously [38]. The cells

were injected into the dorsal tongue of SCID/NOD mouse
and the tumor lesions were measured weekly up to 5
weeks (Fig. 3A). Animals with similar tumor size (80
mm3) in tongue were treated with a vehicle or rhTRAIL.
After intratumoral injection, TRAIL induced a timedependent apoptosis in tumor tissues as indicated by the
onset of apoptotic bodies inside the tumor as well as an
accumulation of the cleaved and active form of caspase-3,
a hallmark of TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B & D).
These observations are in line with the in vitro data in
Fig. 1 demonstrating a potency of rhTRAIL in inducing
apoptosis in oral cancer cells.

The proper expression of TRAIL receptors on
the surface of target cells is essential for the action of
ligand or antibodies. We have previously shown that
TRAIL resistance was associated with a deficiency in
DR4 and DR5 surface expression in breast [21-23] and
rhabdomyosarcoma [19] cell lines. We asked if this was
true in OSCC cells and therefore examined the surface

expression of TRAIL receptors (DR4, DR5, DcR1 and
DcR2) by flow cytometry using PE-conjugated antibodies
specific to each receptor (Fig. 4A & 4B). As expected,
both DR4 and DR5 were significantly expressed on the
surface of TRAIL-sensitive cell lines (HN4 and HN30).
Surface DR5 was also detected in other three cell lines
at differential levels. Notably, DR4 was not detected on
the surface of HN6 cells and only little on OSCC3 cells,
despite its total protein expression across the cell lines
(Fig. 4C). The lack of DR4 surface expression in HN6
cells was directly correlated with the observed resistance to
anti-DR4 antibody and a reduced sensitivity to rhTRAIL.
All the cell lines expressed DcR1 and DcR2 at comparable
total protein levels, while DcR1, but not DcR2, was also
detected on surface of all the cell lines. However, there
was no direct relationship between the levels of decoy
receptors and the observed TRAIL sensitivity.
We also tested the expression of several regulator
proteins that are involved in the regulation of TRAILinduced apoptosis signaling pathway. These include
cFLIP, IAPs, and the Bcl2 family members which are key
regulators of caspase activity and have been implicated
in TRAIL resistance in some cancer cell lines [17, 18].
Immunoblots showed that each protein was expressed at a
similar level in the OSCC cell lines (Fig. 4D), suggesting
that they may play a minor role, if any, in the observed

TRAIL sensitivity. Collectively, these results are consistent
with our previous observations in other cancer types [19,
21-23] that deficiency of TRAIL death receptors on cell
surface is also a critical determinant of TRAIL resistance
in OSCC cells.

Oncogenic Ras activity is associated with TRAIL
sensitivity.
As with many other cancer types, the development
of oral cancer is often accompanied by an upregulated Ras
signaling pathway due to gain of function mutations in ras
genes itself and/or alterations in the regulatory proteins
[2, 27-29]. Recent evidence suggests a link between Ras
activity and the death receptor mediated apoptosis. For
example, transformation by Ras enhanced TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines [24, 39]. To explore
this possibility in OSCC cells, we first determined the level
of endogenous active Ras-GTP by affinity purification
using GST-Raf1 immobilized on agarose beads. Notably,
the levels of Ras-GTP correlated well with the observed
TRAIL sensitivity (Fig. 4A & Table 1). While the total Ras
protein remained the same in all the cell lines, Ras-GTP
is significantly higher in the TRAIL-sensitive cell lines
(HN30 and HN4) than insensitive cell lines.

Ras regulates the surface expression of DR5.

We asked if the introduction of Ras could convert
an insensitive OSCC line to a sensitive one. To this end,
OSCC3 cells were transfected with an empty vector or
vector expressing a constitutively active H-Ras mutant
(H-RasV12). Compared to empty vector, transfection
of H-RasV12 significantly sensitized OSCC3 cells to
apoptosis by rhTRAIL or anti-DR5, but not anti-DR4
antibody (Fig. 5B). In consistent, TRAIL induced an
increase in cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in a doseand time- dependent manner in H-RasV12 transfected
cells (Figs. 5C & D). Thus, our results indicate that Ras
activity plays a role in determining the cellular sensitivity
to rhTRAIL or monoclonal antibody against DR5.

To extend our finding beyond the association
between Ras activity and TRAIL sensitivity, we addressed
the issue of whether Ras regulates the expression of
TRAIL death receptors. By flow cytometry, we found
that the surface expression of DR5 was significantly
upregulated in OSCC3 cells after transfection of RasV12
plasmid (Fig. 6A & B). However, expression of RasV12
had little effect on DR4 surface expression. Further,
there was no change in the total mRNA and protein
expression of both receptors (Figs. 6C & D). These results
demonstrate that Ras is selectively involved in regulation

activity of rhTRAIL was confirmed in a relevant animal
model. We also provide evidence that Ras is involved in
regulation of surface expression of DR5. Ras is frequently
hyperactivated in OSCC tumors [2, 27-29], thus TRAIL
receptor targeted agents could be evaluated for use in the
treatment of this malignancy.
The selectivity of TRAIL towards cancer cells has
stimulated clinical investigations of agents targeting the
TRAIL death receptors, including recombinant human
TRAIL and monoclonal antibodies against DR4 and
DR5. Early clinical trial data showed a general safety
of these agents [15]. In anticipate tumor resistance,
however, a challenge remains to identify the appropriate
patient population that could be beneficial from the
treatments with these agents. This requires identification
of biomarkers that can predict tumor resistance to these

DISCUSSION
The development of molecularly targeted therapies
holds promise in improving the outcome of metastatic
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) – a disease with
consistently poor prognosis for decades. Recent advance
in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the
disease has suggested several therapeutic targets such
as signaling components of EGFR-Ras and PI3K-AKTmTOR pathways [2]. Our study demonstrates that TRAIL
receptor targeted agents may have therapeutic potential
against OSCC. Both rhTRAIL and its agonistic antibodies
induced rapid apoptosis in OSCC cell lines, especially
in the ones harboring high Ras activity. The anticancer

agents. We have previously shown that TRAIL death
receptors, with a higher incident in DR4, undergo
constitutive endocytosis in breast cancer cells that results
in their deficiency on cell surface and cellular resistance
to the targeted therapies [21-23]. Our recent work made a
similar observation in rhabdomyosarcoma cells [19]. In
this study we found that DR4, but not DR5, is deficient on
the surface of HN6 OSCC cell line despite its total protein
expression (Fig. 4A). Lack of surface DR4 rendered the
cells completely resistant to anti-DR4 antibody (Fig. 2C).
Collectively, these data are supportive of our notion that
surface deficiency of DR4 and/or DR5 could be used as
a biomarker to exclude patients from TRAIL receptor
targeted therapies.
As with many other cancer types, the development
of oral cancer is often accompanied by an upregulated
Ras signaling pathway due to gain of function mutations
in ras genes itself and/or alterations in the regulatory
proteins [2, 27-29]. The hyperactivity of Ras pathway is
linked to tumor resistance to the approved EGFR antibody
therapy [40, 41]. In contrast to its best known function
in prompting cell growth, Ras has also been implicated
in activation of cell death pathways [42]. Our data reveal
a close link between Ras activity (Ras-GTP level) and
TRAIL sensitivity in OSCC cell lines. Among the five
cell lines tested, Ras-GTP levels were strongly associated
with cellular sensitivities to rhTRAIL and the agonistic
antibodies. Transfection of OSCC3 cells with H-RasV12,
a constitutively active H-Ras mutant, increased apoptotic
responses to rhTRAIL and anti-DR5 antibody (Fig. 5B).
Thus, TRAIL based therapies may be useful in treating
tumors that contain Ras mutations. In this context, Ras
mutations have been shown to upregulate the total protein
expressions of both DR4 and DR5 in colon cancer cell
lines [24, 39]. Strikingly, expression of RasV12 selectively
upregulated surface expression of DR5, but not DR4,
while it had little or no effect on their total mRNA and
protein expressions (Fig. 6). To our knowledge, this is the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

first evidence that Ras is directly involved in regulation
of surface expression of TRAIL death receptors. Although
the underling mechanisms remain to be elucidated, Ras
has been implicated in the trafficking and endocytosis
signaling of many other receptors. We are currently in the
process to identify the signaling components that medicate
Ras regulated upregulation of DR5.
In summary, we demonstrate a high degree of
OSCC sensitivity to TRAIL receptor targeted agents.
We also found a correlation between Ras activity and
TRAIL sensitivity in OSCC cell lines. These data warrant
additional studies to evaluate the potential use of rhTRAIL
and its agonistic antibodies in treating these malignancies.

Animal studies were carried out as previously
described [38] and followed the NIH-approved protocols
(ASP#10-569) in compliance with the NIH Guidance
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Female
severe immunodeficient (SCID)/NOD mice (NCI), 4 to 6
weeks of age and weighing 18 to 20 g, were housed in
appropriate sterile filter-capped cages, and fed and watered
ad libitum. HN31 cells (1 x 105) were injected directly
into the dorsal tongue and the size (length and width)
of lesions in the tongue was monitored weekly. At five
weeks, total 8 animals with similar tumor volumes (~80
mm3) were randomly divided into two groups (4 animals
per group), followed by intratumoral injections of 50 µl
of PBS (Control group) or 50 µl of TRAIL (100 µg/ml).
After 6 or 24 h post-injection, animals were euthanized
and the tongues were dissected and processed for paraffin
sectioning.
