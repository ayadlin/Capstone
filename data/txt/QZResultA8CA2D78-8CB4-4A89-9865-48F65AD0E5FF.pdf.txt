Abstract
In human endometrial and ovarian cancers, gonadotropinreleasing hormone type I (GnRH-I), GnRH-II, and their
receptors are parts of a negative autocrine regulatory system
of cell proliferation. Based on a tumor-specific signal
transduction, GnRH-I and GnRH-II agonists inhibit the
mitogenic signal transduction of growth factor receptors
and related oncogene products associated with tyrosine
kinase activity via activation of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase resulting in down-regulation of cancer cell proliferation.
Induction of apoptosis is not involved. In this study, we show
that treatment of human endometrial and ovarian cancer cells
with GnRH-II antagonists results in apoptotic cell death via
dose-dependent activation of caspase-3. The antitumor effects
of the GnRH-II antagonists could be confirmed in nude mice.
GnRH-II antagonists inhibited the growth of xenotransplants
of human endometrial and ovarian cancers in nude mice
significantly, without any apparent side effects. Thus, GnRH-II
antagonists seem to be suitable drugs for an efficacious and
less toxic endocrine therapy for endometrial and ovarian
cancers. [Cancer Res 2007;67(4):1750–6]

Introduction
The expression of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH-I)
and its receptor as a part of a negative autocrine/paracrine
regulatory mechanism of cell proliferation has been shown in a
number of malignant tumors, including cancers of endometrium
and ovary (1). In these cancers, the in vitro proliferation can be
inhibited by agonistic analogues of GnRH-I in a dose- and timedependent manner (1–5). GnRH-I antagonists also have marked
antiproliferative activity in most endometrial and ovarian cancer
cell lines tested in vitro, indicating that the dichotomy of GnRH
agonists and antagonists might not apply to the GnRH system in
cancer cells (1–5).
GnRH-I agonists have become a cornerstone in the systematic
treatment of premenopausal women with estrogen-dependent
breast cancer (6). Here, the essential mode of action of GnRH-I
agonists is the down-regulation of pituitary gonadotropin secretion, leading to a suppression of ovarian estrogen production, a
state called reversible medical castration (7). Single-agent therapy
with GnRH-I agonists in doses used for suppression of pituitary
gonadotropin secretion has a modest activity in ovariectomized

patients with ovarian or endometrial cancer, leading, in some
cases, to long-lasting remissions or disease stabilization. This effect
is probably mediated through the GnRH system in the tumor cells
(8). Regarding breast and prostate cancer, the antitumor effects of
GnRH-I agonists and antagonists are mainly due to the downregulation of the hypothalamic-ovarian axis, leading to the
suppression of sex steroid production by the gonads. Using the
human ovarian cancer cell line OV-1063 xenografted into nude
mice, Yano et al. (9, 10) showed a significant inhibition of tumor
growth by chronic treatment with the GnRH-I antagonist cetrorelix
but not with the GnRH-I agonist triptorelin. As both GnRH-I
analogues induced a comparable suppression of the pituitarygonadal axis, the authors speculated that in vivo antitumor effects
of the GnRH-I antagonist cetrorelix were exerted directly on
GnRH-I receptors in the tumors.
The classic GnRH-I receptor signal transduction mechanisms,
known to operate in the pituitary, are not involved in the mediation
of antiproliferative effects of GnRH-I analogues in cancer cells (1).
The GnRH-I receptor rather interacts with the mitogenic signal
transduction of growth factor receptors and related oncogene
products associated with tyrosine kinase activity via activation of a
phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) counteracting the epidermal
growth factor (EGF)–induced auto-tyrosine phosphorylation of the
EGF receptor. Thus, the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated
kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) is decreased. Moreover, the EGF-induced
expression of the immediate early gene c-fos is reduced. Thus, cell
proliferation is decreased (12–14).
Recently, we have shown that GnRH type II (GnRH-II)
mediates antiproliferative effects in human endometrial and
ovarian cancer cell lines that are significantly greater than those
of the GnRH-I agonist triptorelin (11, 15). We could show that
the mitogenic effects of growth factors were counteracted by
GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II, indicating an interaction with
the mitogenic signal transduction (16). We have shown that
[D-Lys6]GnRH-II reduces EGF-induced auto-tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptors via activation of a PTP. EGF-induced
activation of ERK1/2 was blocked after treatment with [D-Lys6]
GnRH-II. Furthermore, EGF-induced expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos was inhibited (16). These data suggest that
the signaling of GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II is comparable
with that of GnRH-I agonists. Induction of apoptosis was not
involved in the antiproliferative effects of GnRH-I or GnRH-II
agonists.
In the present study, we have developed and ascertained the
effects of antagonists of GnRH-II. These GnRH-II antagonists
reduce the growth of endometrial and ovarian cancer cell lines
in vitro. In this study, we have assessed whether or not GnRH-II
antagonists reduce tumor growth via induction of apoptosis. In
addition, we have analyzed the efficacy of the use of GnRH-II
antagonists for an antitumor therapy in nude mice.

GnRH-II Antagonists Induce Apoptosis

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. The human endometrial cancer cell
lines Ishikawa, Hec-1A, and Hec-1B and the ovarian cancer cell lines EFO21, OVCAR-3, and SK-OV-3 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA) or the sources detailed previously (2, 3).
The Ishikawa, Hec-1A, Hec-1B, EFO-21, and OVCAR-3 cell lines express
receptors for GnRH-I and GnRH-II (11, 15–17). The SK-OV-3 cell line is
GnRH-I receptor negative but GnRH-II receptor positive (11, 15–17).
The cells were cultured at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in
air as previously described (2–4).
GnRH analogues. The GnRH-I agonist [D-Trp6]GnRH-I (triptorelin;
pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Trp-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2) was kindly provided by
Ferring Pharmaceuticals (Copenhagen, Denmark). The GnRH-II agonist [DLys6]GnRH-II (pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-His-D-Lys-Trp-Tyr-Pro-Gly-NH2) was synthesized by Peptide Specialty Laboratories GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany).
The GnRH-II antagonist [Ac-D2Nal1, D-4Cpa2, D-3Pal3,6, D-Ala10]GnRH-II
was kindly provided by Dr. Jean Rivier (Salk Institute for Biological Studies,
Clayton Foundation Laboratories for Peptide Biology, La Jolla, CA). The
GnRH-II antagonists [Ac-D2Nal1, D-4Cpa2, D-3Pal3, D-Lys6, D-Ala10]GnRH-II,
[Ac-D2Nal1, D-4Cpa2, D-3Pal3, D-Lys6, Leu8, D-Ala10]GnRH-II, and [AcD2Nal1, D-4Cpa2, D-3Pal3,6, Leu8, D-Ala10]GnRH-II were developed by us and
synthesized by Peptide Specialty Laboratories.
Apoptosis assays. Cells grown in six-well plates were treated without or
with GnRH-II antagonists in a final concentration of 10 5 mol/L or with
increasing concentrations (10 9 to 10 5 mol/L) of the GnRH-II antagonists
for 72 or 96 h before they were harvested.
To quantify apoptosis, we used a procedure similar to that described by
Nicoletti et al. (18) that was based on detecting advanced DNA degradation.
Briefly, a pellet containing 1  106 cells was gently resuspended in 500 mL of
hypotonic fluorochrome solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma,
Deisenhofen, Germany), 0.1% sodium citrate, and 50 mg/mL propidium
iodide (Sigma). The cell suspensions were placed at 4jC in the dark
overnight before flow cytometry analysis of cellular DNA content on a
FACSCalibur equipment (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems,
Mountain View, CA) was done with Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson
Immunocytometry Systems).
Mitochondrial membrane potential. For determination of GnRH-II
antagonist–induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the cells
were treated without or with increasing concentrations (10 9 to 10 6
mol/L) of the GnRH-II antagonists for 72 h. After incubation, the cells
were washed with PBS once, and the mitochondrial membrane potential
was detected using the JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential
detection kit according the instructions of the manufacturer (Biotium,
Hayward, CA).
Western blot analysis of caspase-3 activity. For determination of
GnRH-II antagonist–induced caspase-3 activity, the cells were treated
without or with increasing concentrations (10 9 to 10 6 mol/L) of the
GnRH-II antagonists for 72 h. After incubation, the cells were detached
immediately with 0.5 g trypsin (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 5 mmol
EDTA in 1 liter PBS/bovine serum albumin. The pellets were washed twice
with PBS and resuspended with CelLytic buffer (Sigma) containing protease
inhibitors (Sigma). Equal amounts of protein per sample were used and
diluted to equal volumes with Laemmli buffer (19). The cell lysates were
separated on SDS-PAGE (15%, ProSieve 50 Gel Solution, Cambrex, Verviers,
Belgium) under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (HybonD-ECL, GE Healthcare Europe, Munich, Germany). The
nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% instant skimmed milk
powder, spray-dried (Naturaflor, Töpfer GmbH, Dietmannsried, Germany) in
TBST [137 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 25 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.4)] for 1 h at room temperature, washed with TBST, and then
incubated at 4jC overnight with rabbit anti-human active caspase-3
polyclonal antibody (BD PharMingen, Heidelberg, Germany) in a 1:5,000
dilution in TBST and then, following washings, incubated at room
temperature with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (GE
Healthcare Europe) at an 1:10,000 dilution in TBST for 1 h. After washings,
specifically bound antibody was detected using the enhanced chemilumi-

www.aacrjournals.org

nescence kit (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany). The bands were analyzed
using the Kodak 1D image system (Kodak, New Haven, CT).
To analyze whether GnRH-II antagonist–induced caspase-3 activation is
linked to Gi protein activation, the cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin
(20 ng/mL; Sigma) and then treated as described above.
In vivo studies. Female athymic (nude) mice (CD1 nu/nu), 6 to 8 weeks
old upon arrival, were obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). The
mice were housed in sterile cages in a temperature-controlled room with
12-h light/12-h dark schedule and were fed autoclaved chow and water
ad libitum. All experiments were done according to the German ethical
guidelines and the German laws for protection of animals.
Tumors were initiated by s.c. injection of 1  107 cancer cells into the
right flank. After 2 weeks, all animals had developed solid tumors of about
200 mm3, and treatment was initiated. The in vivo experiments were done
as follows: 25 nmol of GnRH-II antagonist per mouse ( five mice per group
and control group) were injected i.p. Treatment was repeated every day
(ovarian cancer) or every 2 days (endometrial cancer). Tumor volumes were
measured every 2 days (ovarian cancer) or one time per week (endometrial
cancer). The mice were killed after 10 days (ovarian cancer) or 21 days
(endometrial cancer) of treatment.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick-end labeling
assay. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick-end
labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to monitor GnRH-II antagonist–induced
DNA fragmentation as a measure of apoptosis in paraffin-embedded
sections of the human tumors grown in nude mice.
The tumors were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4jC
overnight, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 4-Am
thickness were then prepared and put on silane-coated slides. The slides
were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched by treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 6 min.
Tumor sections were incubated and stained, and the nuclei were visualized
according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (DeadEnd
Colorimetric TUNEL System, Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Biotinylated
nucleotide is incorporated at the 3¶-OH DNA ends using the enzyme
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Horseradish peroxidase–labeled
streptavidin is then bound to these biotinylated nucleotides, which are
detected using the peroxidase substrate, hydrogen peroxide, and the stable
chromogen diaminobenzidine. Counterstaining was done using Meyer’s
hematoxylin for 10 s. The slides were then dehydrated, cleared, mounted
with Permount, and studied by light microscopy.
Statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated three times with
different passages of the respective cell lines. Data were tested for significant
differences using Mann-Whitney U test. The data from the dose response
experiments were tested for significant differences by one-way ANOVA
followed by Student-Newman-Keuls’ test for comparison of individual
groups, after a Bartlett test had shown that variances were homogenous.

cells with cytotoxic agent doxorubicin (positive control) or with
increasing concentrations (10 11 to 10 6 mol/L) of the GnRH-II
antagonist [Ac-D2Nal1, D-4Cpa2, D-3Pal3, D-Lys6, D-Ala10]GnRH-II
for 72 h resulted in a reduction of mitochondrial membrane
potential (Fig. 2A). After treatment with 10 7 mol/L of the
cytotoxic agent doxorubicin (positive control), caspase-3 activity
was decreased to 82.46 F 3.37% of control (= 100%; not significant).
Treatment with 10 11 mol/L of the GnRH-II antagonist resulted in
a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential to 86.40 F 8.98%
of control (= 100%; not significant). Treatment with 10 9 mol/L of
the GnRH-II antagonist resulted in a decrease of mitochondrial
membrane potential to 63.27 F 9.79% of control (= 100%; P < 0.05).
After treatment with 10 7 mol/L of the GnRH-II antagonist,
mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced to 50.98 F 10.01%
of control (= 100%; P < 0.01). The effects were maximal at 10 6
mol/L concentrations of the GnRH-II antagonist and corresponded
to a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential to 46.17 F
5.37% of control (= 100%; P < 0.01).

Effects of GnRH-II Antagonists on Caspase-3 Activity
The effects of the GnRH-II antagonists on induction of apoptotic
cell death could further be confirmed by measurement of caspase-3
activity. Treatment of OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells with cytotoxic
agent doxorubicin (positive control) or with increasing concentrations (10 9 to 10 6 mol/L) of the GnRH-II antagonist [AcD2Nal1, D-4Cpa2, D-3Pal3, D-Lys6, D-Ala10]GnRH-II for 72 h resulted
in increased caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2B). After treatment with 10 7

8.05% of control (= 100%; P < 0.001). After treatment with 10 7

Action
To show the linkage between GnRH-II antagonist–induced
activation of G-protein ai and activation of caspase-3, the effect
of pertussis toxin on GnRH-II antagonist–induced caspase-3
activity was analyzed (Fig. 2C). After treatment with 10 7 mol/L
of the GnRH-II antagonist, caspase-3 activity was increased to
198.7 F 56.7% of control (= 100%; not significant). The GnRH-II
antagonist–induced increase of caspase-3 activity was reduced by

To show the proof-of-principle of an antitumor therapy using
GnRH-II antagonists, nude mice bearing xenografted human
endometrial or ovarian tumors s.c. were treated with GnRH-II
antagonists.
Ovarian cancer. Female nude mice bearing OVCAR-3 ovarian
tumors s.c. were treated without (control) or with 25 nmol per
injection of GnRH-II antagonists [Ac-D2Nal1, D-4Cpa2, D-3Pal3, DLys6, D-Ala10]GnRH-II (AG-1), [Ac-D2Nal1, D-4Cpa2, D-3Pal3, D-Lys6,
Leu8, D-Ala10]GnRH-II (AG-2), or [Ac-D2Nal1, D-4Cpa2, D-3Pal3,6,
Leu8, D-Ala10]GnRH-II (AG-3; Fig. 3A). The treatments were
repeated every day, and tumor volumes were measured every
2 days. The mice were killed after 10 days of treatment. The
increase of the tumor volume of the mice receiving therapy with
GnRH-II antagonists was lower than with the control animals. After
4 days of treatment, the differences became significant (P < 0.01).
Due to high variances within the control group, the differences
were not significant anymore after 10 days of treatment. Side
effects were not observed.
Induction of apoptosis in vivo. To show that GnRH-II
antagonists induce apoptosis within the tumor xenotransplants,
we did TUNEL assays (Fig. 3B and C). In the TUNEL assay, the
enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase labels 3¶-OH DNA
ends, generated during apoptosis, with biotinylated nucleotides.
The latter are detected by immunoperoxidase staining. The amount
of apoptotic cells in tumors of nude mice receiving therapy with
GnRH-II antagonists (Fig. 3C) was higher than with the control
animals (Fig. 3B).
Endometrial cancer. Female nude mice bearing Hec-1B
endometrial tumors s.c. were treated without (control I) or with
25 nmol per injection of GnRH-I agonist triptorelin (control II)
or with 25 nmol per injection of the GnRH-II antagonists [AcD2Nal1 , D-4Cpa 2 , D-3Pal3 , D-Lys6 , D-Ala 10 ]GnRH-II (AG-1),

(AG-3; Fig. 4A). The treatments were repeated every 2 days, and
tumor volumes were measured one time per week. The mice were
killed after 21 days of treatment. The increase of the tumor volume
of the mice receiving therapy with GnRH-II antagonists was lower
than with the control animals. After 7 days of treatment, the
differences became highly significant (P < 0.001) and remained
highly significant (Fig. 4B; P < 0.001). Side effects were not

pathway linked to the GnRH receptor between the pituitary and
peripheral tumors may be one explanation for the antagonistic
action of GnRH-I antagonist in the pituitary and the agonistic
action of GnRH-I antagonist in cancer cells. However, the
dichotomy of GnRH-I agonists and antagonists does not exist in
tumor cells because the proliferation of cancer cell lines expressing
GnRH receptors is inhibited by both agonistic and antagonistic
analogues of GnRH-I (12). Another explanation could be that the
agonistic effects of GnRH-I antagonist cetrorelix are due to a crossreaction with an additional GnRH receptor. We have recently
shown that in cell lines affected by both GnRH-I agonist triptorelin
and GnRH-I antagonist cetrorelix, the effects of the former were
abrogated after GnRH-I receptor knockout, whereas the effects of
cetrorelix persisted (11). These findings suggested that the
antiproliferative/agonistic effects of the GnRH-I antagonist cetrorelix are not mediated through the GnRH-I receptor.
Recently, we have shown that GnRH-II mediates antiproliferative
effects in endometrial and ovarian cancer cells that are significantly greater than those of the GnRH-I agonist triptorelin (15). The
antiproliferative effects of the GnRH-I agonist triptorelin and the
GnRH-II agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II in these cell lines were not due
to increased apoptosis (15, 23, 24). In our system, triptorelin and
[D-Lys6]GnRH-II interfered with EGF-induced signal transduction

antagonists are due to an interaction with the pituitary GnRH
receptors, a second control group (control II) was treated with 25
nmol per injection of the GnRH-I agonist triptorelin. The increase

Discussion
Previous work showed direct antiproliferative effects of GnRH-I
agonists and antagonists in GnRH receptor–positive human
endometrial and ovarian cancer cells (1–5). GnRH receptor signal
transduction mechanisms that operate in the pituitary gonadotrophs are not involved in the mediation of the antiproliferative
effects of GnRH-I analogues in these cancer cells (1). GnRH
receptors in the pituitary couple to G protein aq and activate
phospholipase C and protein kinase C (20), whereas GnRH
receptors in reproductive tumors couple to pertussis toxin–
sensitive G proteins of the Gi family and activate phosphotyrosine
phosphatase (21, 22). The difference in the signal transduction

GnRH-II Antagonists Induce Apoptosis

and completely inhibited EGF-induced autophosphorylation of
EGF receptor and induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(ERK1/2) activity (1, 16). This is different with GnRH-II antagonists.
In this study, we have shown that treatment of human endometrial
and ovarian cancer cells with GnRH-II antagonists resulted in
apoptotic cell death. The fact that treatment with GnRH-II
antagonists resulted in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
and an increase of caspase-3 activity in cultured endometrial and
ovarian cancer cells suggests that GnRH-II antagonists induce
apoptosis in these cells at least in part through activation of the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Recently, Maiti et al. reported that
high concentrations of the GnRH-II antagonist trptorelix-1 but not
GnRH-I antagonist cetrorelix induced prostate cancer cell death
in vitro, probably through an apoptotic process (25).
In earlier studies, we have shown that a functional GnRH-II
receptor may exist in human cancers (11, 15–17, 24). GnRH-II
agonist [D-Lys6]GnRH-II had strong antiproliferative effects in the
GnRH-I receptor–negative human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3
(15). After knockout of GnRH-I receptor expression, the
antiproliferative effects of GnRH-I agonist triptorelin on originally
GnRH-I receptor–positive endometrial and ovarian cancer cell
lines were abrogated, whereas the growth inhibitory effects of [DLys6]GnRH-II were still the same as observed in nontransfected
cells (11). Because treatment of the GnRH-I receptor–negative
but GnRH-II receptor–positive ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3
with GnRH-II antagonists resulted in induction of apoptosis,
GnRH-II antagonists may be effective via the GnRH-II receptor.
However, we cannot exclude that in addition GnRH-II antagonists
induce apoptosis via the GnRH-I receptor. Further experiments
(i.e., GnRH-I receptor and GnRH-II receptor knockout experiments) are required to analyze the cross-reactivity of GnRH-II
antagonists.
The antiproliferative actions of GnRH-I and GnRH-II analogues
were predominantly mediated through the pertussis toxin–
sensitive G protein ai (13, 16). To show the linkage between
GnRH-II antagonist-induced GnRH-II receptor activation and
induction of apoptosis, the effects of pertussis toxin on GnRH-II
antagonist–induced caspase-3 activity were analyzed. The GnRHII antagonist–induced increase of caspase-3 activity was reduced
by pertussis toxin, indicating that it is mediated at least in part
by G protein ai. Comparable data were obtained by Imai et al.
(26). They have shown that GnRH-I antagonist cetrorelix–induced
apoptotic cell death of human ovarian cancer cells was mediated
through pertussis toxin–sensitive Gi protein–linked GnRH
receptor.
We could show the proof-of-principle of an antitumor therapy
using GnRH-II antagonists in vivo in nude mice bearing s.c.
xenografts of human endometrial or ovarian tumors. Nude mice
bearing Hec-1B human endometrial tumors or OVCAR-3 human
ovarian tumors were treated with the GnRH-II antagonists

D-4Cpa2, D-3Pal3,6, Leu8, D-Ala10]GnRH-II. The increase of the
tumor volume of the mice receiving therapy with GnRH-II
antagonists was significantly lower than with the control animals.
Toxic side effects were not observed.
To exclude that the antitumor effects of the GnRH-II antagonists
are mainly due to an interaction with the pituitary GnRH
receptors and a subsequent reduction of ovarian estrogen
production, a control group was treated with GnRH-I agonist
triptorelin. Because no antitumor effects using triptorelin were
observed, down-regulation of the hypothalamic-ovarian axis
cannot be the main reason for the antitumor effects of GnRH-II
antagonists. GnRH-II antagonists seem to affect the tumor cells
directly by inducing apoptosis. The amount of apoptotic cells,
counted using TUNEL assay, in tumors of nude mice receiving
therapy with GnRH-II antagonists was higher than with the
control animals. Therefore, the antitumor effects of the GnRH-II
antagonists in vivo are due to induction of apoptosis. However, it
is not excluded that the down-regulation of the hypothalamicovarian axis may have a little part on antitumor effects of GnRH-II
antagonists. Considering that, after 21 days of treatment with
GnRH-II antagonists, no down-regulation of GnRH-I receptor and
GnRH-II receptor expression was found in the tumors that were
grown in vivo, GnRH-II antagonists seem to be suitable for chronic
or repeated therapy.
GnRH-II antagonists seem to be suitable drugs for an efficacious
and less toxic targeted therapy for endometrial and ovarian
cancers. Our findings could be the basis for a further evaluation in
clinical trials. GnRH-I agonists and GnRH-I antagonists have been
widely used in the therapy of cancer (8, 27–30) and endometriosis
(31–33) as well as in reproductive medicine (34–38). Their effects
are mainly due to the down-regulation of the hypothalamic-ovarian
axis. Because we could not observe antitumor effects in vivo after
down-regulation of the hypothalamic-ovarian axis using the GnRHI agonist triptorelin, the down-regulation of the hypothalamicovarian axis alone cannot be responsible for the antitumor effects
of GnRH-II antagonists.
In conclusion, we have shown that GnRH-II antagonists exert
antitumor effects in human endometrial and ovarian cancer cells
by inducing apoptosis through the caspase cascade. The proofof-principle of an antitumor therapy using GnRH-II antagonists
could be shown in vivo in nude mice bearing human endometrial
or ovarian tumors s.c. As toxic side effects were not observed, this
approach should be further studied.
