ABSTRACT
Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most common intracranial
hematomas worldwide with a high incidence in the general population. However, the
optimum treatment for CSDH is Burr-hole drainage with or without rinse Considering
the poor outcomes of CSDH in aged patients, and ambiguous prediction of recurrence
in many sides of recurrent CSDHs who have been analyzed, new effective therapies
are needed for those CSDHs who are predicated to have poor prognosis for surgery
and/or have a higher risk of recurrence. Statins, which is the first-line treatment
for patients with high cholesterol and coronary heart disease. However, statins are
still not solely limited in the treatment of these diseases. It has been demonstrated
that statins could improve CSDH due to its effect of regulation of angiogenesis and
inflammation. In this review, in order to provide potential new treatment for CSDH
we summarize the recent findings of statins in CSDH in order to try to clarify the
mechanisms of this effect.

INTRODUCTION

Despite the controversy and ineffectiveness of
current therapies and the need for new therapeutic
strategies, little is known about the mechanisms
underlying CSDH progression [4]. Increasing evidence
indicate that impaired angiogenesis in the neomembrane
and localized inflammation may play an important role
in CSDH formation. Impaired angiogenesis may induce
blood leakage from immature vessels of the neomembrane.
Repair of vessel leakage is further impeded by localized
inflammation [5-8].
Recent studies support a potential therapeutic role
for Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
(HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors approved for cholesterol
reduction, in enhancing angiogenesis and reducing
inflammation associated with CSDH [9, 10]. The statin
atorvastatin was shown to improve angiogenesis and
increases the level of circulating endothelial progenitor

Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the
most common intracranial hematomas worldwide with
an incidence of 58 per 10,000 among people 70 years or
older and 5 per 10,000 people in the general population
[1]. Standard treatment for CSDH is Burr-hole drainage
with or without rinsing [2]. However, despite surgical
treatment, recurrence rates among treated patients are still
relatively high. What’s more, as most CSDH patients are
elderly, they are at high risk of suffering from pneumonia,
peri-operational infection and high-surface-tension
pulmonary edema following surgery [3].Considering
the poor outcomes of aged patients with CSDH and
the likelihood of recurrence, new effective therapies
are needed for patients with CSDHs that have a poor
prognosis for surgery and/or at high risk for recurrence.

cells (EPCs)—cells essential to new blood vessel
formation—by activating the endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS), endothelial protein kinase Akt/PKB and
Notch1 in patients with CSDH [11-14]. Atorvastatin also
inhibited inflammation and decreased the levels of proinflammatory molecules [15-17]. A better understanding of
the mechanisms behind these therapeutic statin effects may
provide novel targets for future therapeutics for CSDH. In
this review, we summarize recent findings regarding the
mechanism and role of statins in CSDH.

vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced
EC migration [28]. Statins have also been shown to
enhance migration and attenuate cellular senescence by
upregulating telomere repeat-binding factor (TRF2) [29].
Statin simvastatin may also promote EPC adhesion by upregulating integrin α5 and β1, subunits of the fibronectin
receptor [18]. What’s more, a recent study showed that, in
cultured human ECs, low-dose atorvastatin inhibited EC
senescence by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production [30].
Interestingly,
statin-mediated
effects
are
dose dependent. Low doses of statins promoted
angiogenesis[10, 28], while high doses of statins inhibited
the growth and migration of EPCs [31, 32].
The endothelial promoting effects of statins
have revealed the cholesterol lowering therapy to be a
potentially novel therapeutic approach to treating CSDH.
More researches are needed to further illustrate the
functional mechanisms of statins in CSDH and determine
the potential clinical uses for statins for CSDH treatment.

Statins mediate endothelium renewal and repair
via endothelial progenitor cells
Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are bone
marrow-derived late stage stem cells that circulate in
the blood. EPCs promote vascular repair of denuded
vessel walls and renew endothelium [18] through various
processes including mobilization and differentiation [19].
Many factors such as trauma and hematomas mobilize
EPCs from the bone into the peripheral bloodstream
[20]. These mobile EPCs home to damaged tissue and
differentiate into mature endothelial cells that promote
vascular repair [21-23].
Song et al. found that the level of peripheral blood
EPCs in patients with CSDH was significantly lower than
in healthy patients, and that the postoperation EPC level
for recurrent patients was significantly lower than in nonrecurrent patients. These data suggest that low EPC levels
impair endothelium repair capacity, and thus increase the
risk of CSDH development and recurrence [19].
A series of studies have demonstrated that statins
promote EPC processes involved in endothelium renewal
and repair and reduce senescence and apoptosis. In
Landmesser’s 2004 study, they showed that increased
endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) availability was required
for statin-induced improvement of EPC mobilization
[24]. Liu et al. showed that atorvastatin blocked miR-221
and miR-222 inhibition of cell migration, tube formation
and wound healing by endothelial cells in vitro [25]. In
addition, in coronary artery disease patients, miR-221
and miR-222 expression was inversely related to EPC
levels [26]. There is also evidence that statins induce
mobilization and migration of EPCs through activation
of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP9), two proteins involved in extracellular matrix (ECM)
degradation [27].
Statin promotes EPC activity through multiple
pathways. In an ischemic hind limb C57BL/6 mouse
model, statins enhanced EPC proliferation and migration
and decreased apoptosis through activation of the Akt/
eNOS pathway, effects that were inhibited by the PI3K/
Akt inhibitor, LY294002 [27]. Statin treatment also
decreased EPC apoptosis by activation of the Akt/NOS
pathway [27]. In a study conducted by Vasa et al, statin
treatment activated the Akt/ eNOS pathway and mediated

Statins improve vessel maturation by inhibiting
vascular endothelial growth factor expression
Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs)
and their receptors play critical roles in vasculogenesis,
vascular permeability and angiogenesis [33, 34]. VEGF is
also highly expressed in the serum of patients with CSDH
and in both the dura and outer membrane of the CSH
[6, 35]. This high VEGF concentration in the hematoma
fluid may be of major pathophysiological importance
in the generation and steady increase of the hematoma
volume [36]. Interestingly, VEGF promotes angiogenesis,
but when expressed persistently at a high level, it also
inhibits the maturation of new vessels [37]. This is
observed in subdural hematomas. Excessive expression of
VEGF increases the number of blood vessels with high
permeability [38], but also leads to immature and unstable
vessels [39].
A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
showed that statin treatment was associated with a
significant reduction in circulating VEGF concentrations,
particularly lipophilic statins and statins administered for
over long periods of time [40]. Thus inhibiting VEGF may
be beneficial for treating patients with CSDHs in the early
stages.

Statins improve functional recovery and vessel
maturation by inhibiting inflammation in CSDH
There is increasing evidence showing that localized
inflammation plays a key role in the formation of a
CSDH [41-43]. A similar imbalance between anti- and
pro-inflammatory molecules has been found in the
CSDH fluid and this imbalance could influence the

vascular permeability of the hematoma neomembrane
and angiogenesis[7, 8, 44, 45]. Recent reports revealed
that inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α , IL-6 and IL10 are highly expressed in the hematoma fluid of patients
with CSDH [44, 46].. The inflammatory reaction alters
osmotic pressure of hematoma liquid, and may impact
angiogenesis by altering vessel maturation [47].
Several anti-inflammatory therapies are being
explored for the treatment of CSDH, including
glucocorticoids, mannitol and angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors [3] [48-50]. However, these drugs
are associated with adverse effects. For example, while
dexamethasone, a potent anti-inflammatory drug,
successfully cures CSDH [50], it is associated with many
side effects such as also cause increased weight, thrush,
nausea, agitation, acne, which seriously influenced its
clinical use [51].
Statins have also been shown to suppress
inflammation and decrease pro-inflammatory molecule
levels in CSDH. Li et al. has found that rats with subdermal
hematomas (SDHs) treated by atorvastatin experienced
better behavioral function recovery and rapid volume
elimination, had more new CD31+ blood vessels and less
neutrophilic granulocytes than rats treated with saline[52].
Atorvastatin treatment also significantly decreased TNF-α
and IL-6 levels [52]. These studies suggest that statininduced inflammation modulation significantly influences
SDH elimination and functional recovery in rats [52],
and may be beneficial in treating CSDH. More clinical
research is needed to confirm the role and the mechanisms
that inflammation plays in CSDH.

[12, 15, 53], and may provide a novel treatment method
for CSDH. In this review, we show that statins may
impact CSDH development and progression by inhibiting
inflammation and improving blood vessel formation and
maturation. Evidence from a series of studies showed
that statins exhibit ameliorative effects by promoting
EPC mobilization and activation, suppressing VEGF and
inhibiting inflammation (Figure 1).
ECPs are a key factor in hemostasis and vascular
repair through mobilization, tendency, adhesion,
proliferation, and differentiation [19]. Statins promote
EPC mobilization by increasing eNOS and activation
of MMP-2 and -9 [24], enhance EPCs migration by
inhibiting miR- 221 and miR-222 [25, 26], enhance EPC
proliferation by activating the Akt/eNOS pathway[27, 28]
and enhance migratory capacity and attenuate cellular
senescence by up-regulating TRF2 [29]. We speculate
that statins may improve CSDH via these mechanisms, but
more research is still needed to validate these mechanisms
and investigate these therapeutic effects.
VEGF is another major component in CSDH
maintenance. VEGF expression is markedly up-regulated
in both the dura and outer membrane of CSDH [35, 36].
Treatment with statins reduces VEGF expression. Thus,
treatment with statins in the early stages of a CSDH may
prevent VEGF upregulation and further progression of the
hematoma [52].
Localized inflammation reaction and inflammatory
factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) ,
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10, also contribute to CSDH
formation [41-43, 46]. Statin-induced inflammatory
modulation significantly improved functional recover,
SDH elimination, and vessel maturation in rats with
CSDH Treatment also significantly decreased TNF-α and
IL-6 expression [52].
In conclusion, statins are a promising therapeutic
intervention for the treatment of CSDH. More research is

EXPERT OPINION
In this report, we have discussed the therapeutic
potential of statins in treating CSDH based on studies
conducted in the last five years. We have discovered
several interesting findings on how statins may influence
CSDH. The first one being that different doses of stains
have different effects on EPCs and VEGF. Low doses
of statins promote angiogenesis [10, 28], but high
doses inhibit EPC growth and migration which inhibits
angiogenesis [31, 32]. Interestingly, VEGF promotes
angiogenesis, but when expressed at a high level it also
inhibits the maturation of new vessels [37]. These dosesdependent effects need further investigation.
The second interesting finding is that stains may
have varying effects via VEGF in different stages of
CSDH. Li et al. found that VEGF expression was high
and then slowly decreased following treatment with a
statin [52]. We speculate that, in early CSDH, inhibiting
VEGF may be beneficial for preventing further CSDH
development.
While an increasing number of studies are
exploring the role of statins in CSDH, it is important that
the biological and underlying mechanisms of its effects
remain a major focus of future studies.

FIVE-YEAR VIEW
A randomized clinical trial about the effect and
safety of atorvastatin to treat CSDH in ClinicTrials.gov
(NCT0236232) has been completed in October, 2016.
Excitedly, the result of atorvastatin on CSDH was positive
in this study. We are waiting for the publication of this
important article. Over the next 5 years, we expect statins
to be a strong contender as a therapeutic for CSDH.
Pharmacological evidence and clinical trial results
support the interpretation that statins treat CSDHs by
regulating potential signaling pathways, such as Akt/eNOS
pathway, MMP-2 and MMP-9,ROS, TNF-α and IL-6.We
predict that statins will be approved for the treatment of
these CSDHs. Further research is need to confirm the
mechanism, therapeutic effects and safety of statin use in
treating CSDH.
