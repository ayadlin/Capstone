SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene among all human cancers. Prevalent p53 missense
mutations abrogate its tumor suppressive function and lead to “gain-of-function” (GOF) that
promotes cancer. Here we show that p53 GOF mutants bind to and upregulate chromatin
regulatory genes, including the methyltransferases KMT2A (MLL1) and KMT2D (MLL2), and
acetyltransferase KAT6A (MOZ or MYST3), resulting in genome-wide increases of histone
methylation and acetylation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas shows specific upregulation of

MLL1, MLL2, and MOZ in p53 GOF patient-derived tumors, but not in p53 wildtype or p53 null
tumors. Cancer cell proliferation is dramatically lowered by genetic knockdown of MLL1, or by
pharmacological inhibition of the MLL1 methyltransferase complex. Our study reveals a novel
chromatin mechanism underlying the progression of tumors with GOF p53, and suggests new
possibilities for designing combinatorial chromatin-based therapies for treating individual cancers
driven by prevalent GOF p53 mutations.

Author Manuscript

Most mutant forms of p53 are caused by single amino acid substitutions mapping to the
DNA binding domain1. These mutations result in expression of full-length p53 protein, but
loss of wildtype (WT) tumor suppressive function2-4. The high prevalence of missense
substitutions, particularly certain “hotspot” mutations, suggests a selective advantage during
cancer progression. Indeed, these mutants gain neomorphic oncogenic functions, including
altered cancer spectrum2,3, deregulated metabolic pathways4,5, increased metastasis6,7 and
enhanced chemotherapy resistance8. Evidence from recent studies points to one potential
mechanism of GOF p53, functioning through association with other transcription factors,
and driving gene transcription in oncogenic pathways, such as the mevalonate pathway4 and
etoposide resistance pathway8. A transcription mechanism is further supported by the
importance of retaining an intact transactivation domain for oncogenic GOF p53 function4,9.
Nonetheless, how GOF p53 contributes to massive changes of the cancer genome and
transcriptome remains to be elucidated9,10. Altered chromatin pathways have been
implicated in various aspects of cancer11,12, given their regulation of genome-wide
transcription programs13,14. However, to date there has not been evidence of direct crosstalk
between GOF p53 mutants and chromatin regulation.

Genome-wide binding of GOF p53 mutants
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) to
determine genome-wide binding locations of p53 in a panel of breast cancer cell lines –
MCF7 (p53 WT), MDA-MB-175VII (p53 WT), HCC70 (p53 R248Q), BT-549 (p53 R249S)
and MDA-MB-468 (p53 R273H). We found that the binding of p53 to gene-proximal
regions (less than 10 kb) of transcription start sites (TSS) in the two WT p53 cell lines
strongly resembled each other, whereas these WT p53 peaks were highly dissimilar from the
peaks in any of the GOF p53 mutants. Strikingly, p53 binding patterns in the three GOF p53
cell lines were similar among themselves (Fig. 1a; Extended Data Fig. 1a). In addition, we
aligned published p53 R248W ChIP-seq data from Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS)
MDAH087 cells8, and again, TSS-proximal peaks of p53 R248W resembled those of p53
R273H and p53 R248Q (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c), but were distinct from the WT p53
peaks (Extended Data Fig. 1d, e).
We performed motif analysis for TSS-proximal peaks of the p53 R273H mutant and predict
the E26 Transformation-Specific (ETS) motif as the most enriched (Extended Data Fig. 2a),
which is distinct from the WT p53 motif (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Consistently, one ETS
family member, ETS2, has been shown to associate with mutant p538. We confirmed that
ETS2 interacts with various GOF p53 mutants, but to a much lesser extent with WT p53
(Fig. 1b; Extended Data Fig. 2c), as previously noted8. Co-immunoprecipitation at
endogenous protein levels also demonstrated that ETS2 interacts with GOF p53, but not

with WT p53 (Extended Data Fig. 2d, e). We analyzed ChIP-seq datasets from the
ENCODE project for all transcription factors15,16, and observed that, compared to other
transcription factors, ETS family proteins have significantly higher overlap with GOF p53
TSS-proximal peaks, but not with WT p53 TSS-proximal peaks (Extended Data Fig. 2f, g).
Notably, in both WT and GOF p53 cases, RNA polymerase II (PolII) group has the highest
percentage overlap with p53 peaks, indicative of transcriptional activity. The extent of PolII
overlap is similar to the ETS group in GOF p53 cells, but much higher than the ETS group
in WT p53 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2f, g).

GOF p53 targets chromatin regulators

To determine specific functional categories, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis on
TSS-proximal peaks. As expected, DNA damage response pathways were most enriched in
WT p53 targets (Extended Data Fig. 2h; Table S1). In contrast, p53 R273H bound to genes
related to translation and ribosomal synthesis (Fig. 1c; Table S1), which was reasonable
given the rapid growth rate of these cells. We were particularly intrigued by GOF p53
binding to a group of genes functionally related to histone methylation (Fig. 1c). Indeed, this
was seen in track views of kmt2a (mll1) and kmt2d (mll2), genes encoding
methyltransferases of histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) (Fig. 2a), that are components of
alternative forms of the COMPASS complex (complex proteins associated with Set1). The
other two GOF p53 mutants that we examined, as well as p53 R248W from LFS MDAH087
cells8, all showed similar binding at mll1 and mll2 (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b, e, f). Track
views confirmed binding of GOF p53 to a gene encoding a common subunit of COMPASS
complexes, rbbp5 (Extended Data Fig. 3h). In contrast, WT p53 did not appear to bind any
of these genes, although as expected, it bound promoter regions of its canonical targets,
including cdkn1a (p21), mdm2 and bbc3 (puma) (Fig. 2a; Extended Data Fig. 3c, i, j). We
then analyzed a large set of 600 chromatin regulators for potential GOF p53 binding, and
found an additional group of chromatin regulatory genes that showed peak enrichment
(Table S2). Of great interest among these was kat6a (moz), a histone acetyltransferase, and
track views confirmed the presence of GOF p53 but not WT p53 (Fig. 2a; Extended Data
Fig. 3d, g).

Author Manuscript

Using ChIP-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR), we validated the binding of GOF p53 to mll1,
mll2, and moz genes, but not adjacently upstream or downstream of the peak regions (Fig.
2b; Extended Data Fig. 4a-c). Moreover, we confirmed GOF p53 binding to all other targets
in the “histone methylation” GO category (rbbp5, ogt and ppp1cc), and to a few additional
chromatin factors (including smarcd2 and dcaf10), in all three GOF p53 cell lines (Extended
Data Fig. 4d-f). We verified the ChIP-qPCR results with a second p53 polyclonal antibody,
FL393 (Extended Data Fig. 4g). In parallel experiments with both p53 antibodies, WT p53
showed binding to the p21 and mdm2 canonical binding sites, but not to any of the GOF p53
targets tested (Fig. 2c; Extended Data Fig. 4h). We also examined a pancreatic cancer cell
line, PANC-1 (p53 R273H), and observed a similar binding pattern (Extended Data Fig. 4i),
suggesting a general phenomenon in various cancer types. Furthermore, the ChIP-qPCR
signal of GOF p53 was attenuated upon p53 knockdown (Fig. 2d). Knockdown of ets2 also
led to reduced binding of GOF p53 over mll1 and moz, and to a lesser extent, over the mll2
peak region (Fig. 2e). To test the association of GOF p53 near mll1 in a non-tumor

background, we performed ChIP-qPCR in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
bearing GOF p53 or WT p53, and consistently, mouse GOF p53 showed significant
enrichment over the mll1 promoter region (Fig. 2f).

GOF p53 regulates MLL, MOZ, and histone PTMs

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To examine whether GOF p53 is required for expression of the chromatin regulators, we
reduced GOF p53 level and found that the mRNA levels of mll1, mll2 and moz were also
decreased (Fig. 3a; Extended Data Fig. 5a); whereas no change was detected when WT p53
level was reduced (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Simply increasing WT p53 protein level via
Nutlin-mediated stabilization did not recapitulate activation of the chromatin regulators
(Extended Data Fig. 5c, d). MLL1 protein level was also decreased in the GOF p53
knockdown (Fig. 3b), but not by WT p53 knockdown (Extended Data Fig. 5e), as was also
observed for reduction of MOZ protein level upon GOF p53 knockdown (Extended Data
Fig. 5f). Reduction of ETS2 level led to decreased expression of mll1 and moz, and to a
lesser extent, mll2 (Fig. 3c; Extended Data Fig. 5g), which was in accordance with the
relative binding changes of GOF p53 to these genes (Fig. 2e). We verified the ets2
knockdown result in another GOF p53 cell line, BT-549, and detected similarly decreased
expression of mll1 and moz, and to a lesser extent, mll2 (Extended Data Fig. 5h, i). We also
performed PolII ChIP-qPCR and observed concomitantly decreased PolII occupancy
specifically over mll1, mll2, and moz TSS regions upon ets2 knockdown (Fig. 3d). We
examined the importance of another ETS family member, ETS1. In contrast, ets1
knockdown had no effect on the expression of mll1, mll2, or moz (Extended Data Fig. 5j, k),
nor did it alter GOF p53 or PolII binding (Extended Data Fig. 5l, m). Since ETS family
proteins consist of 28 members17, it is likely that additional ETS protein(s) other than ETS1
may be involved. Nevertheless, our observations are consistent with previous studies
showing that ETS2, but not ETS1, is important in mediating GOF p53 function8,18.

The regulation of histone modifying enzymes led to investigation of the cognate histone
post-translational modifications (PTMs). We observed a global decrease in histone H3
Lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac, catalyzed by MOZ19) in response to knockdown of GOF
p53, whereas other histone acetylation marks did not show significant changes (Fig. 3e;
Extended Data Fig. 5n, o, p). The reduction of H3K9ac was also observed when MOZ level
itself was decreased by shRNA (Extended Data Fig. 5q). In contrast, H3K4 tri-methylation
and H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, catalyzed by MLL1 and MLL2,
respectively20) showed only slight global reduction upon GOF p53 knockdown (Fig. 3e;
Extended Data Fig. 5n, o, p). This is reasonable, however, given that H3K4 is methylated by
six members of the COMPASS complexes20, and indeed, previous studies showed that
inhibiting or knocking out one of them did not substantially change global H3K4
methylation21,22.
We further validated the regulation of mll1, mll2, and moz by GOF p53 in the knock-in
MEFs. We found significantly higher expression of these genes in GOF p53 MEFs than in
WT p53 MEFs or in MEFs derived from p53 knockout mice (p53 null MEFs) (Fig. 3f;
Extended Data Fig. 6a-c). Furthermore, when GOF p53 was reduced, mll1 expression was
also lowered (Fig. 3g; Extended Data Fig. 6d), and ectopically expressing GOF p53 in p53

null MEFs enhanced mll1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f). GOF p53 MEFs also
showed higher global level of H3K9ac, and a slight elevation of H3K4me3, compared with
WT p53 or p53 null MEFs (Fig. 3h; Extended Data Fig. 6g). Notably, other histone
modifications associated with active gene transcription, including H3K27ac and H3K36me3,
remained at comparable levels (Fig. 3h). In addition, H3K4me3 or H3K9ac did not change
upon knockdown of WT p53 (Extended Data Fig. 6h), even though cell growth was
increased as expected (Extended Data Fig. 6i). Taken together, these data suggest that
changes in H3K4me3 and H3K9ac are specific to GOF p53 directly activating MLL1 and
MOZ enzymes.

Author Manuscript

The modest global change in H3K4me3 in the presence of GOF p53 prompted investigation
of local changes in H3K4 methylation. We performed RNA-seq and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq in
MEFs with endogenous WT p53 or GOF p53. Compared with the genome-wide average,
known MLL1 target genes22 were more highly expressed and displayed higher H3K4me3
enrichment in GOF p53 MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 6j). For example, we observed increased
H3K4me3 level and RNA expression within the hoxa gene cluster (Fig. 3i; Extended Data
Fig. 6k), a well-studied target of MLL1 and commonly upregulated in leukemia23,24.
Conversely, WT p53 targets, such as p21, showed decreased RNA expression and TSSassociated H3K4me3 in GOF p53 MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 6l). Notably, H3K4me3
enrichment at the TSS of genes in GOF p53 MEFs was slightly, but significantly higher at a
genome-wide level than in WT p53 MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 6m), consistent with the
slight global increase of H3K4me3 (Fig. 3h). We validated the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq and
RNA-seq results by ChIP-qPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively, observing in GOF p53 MEFs
significantly higher H3K4me3 enrichment, and higher expression, of hox genes, than in WT
p53 or p53 null MEFs (Fig. 3j; Extended Data Fig. 6n).

MLL1 is essential for cancer phenotype of GOF p53 cells
Previous studies have revealed that cells expressing GOF p53 rely on it for cell growth and
survival25,26. Consistently, we observed that GOF p53 knockdown in cancer cells led to
strong decrease in cell proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In contrast, lowering of WT
p53 levels resulted in elevated growth (Extended Data Fig. 6i, 7b). To investigate the
function of GOF p53 driving chromatin regulators, we carried out the same time course, and
found that the reduction of MLL1 or MLL2 in GOF p53 cancer cells led to dramatic loss of
cell growth (Extended Data Fig. 7c), phenocopying the knockdown of GOF p53 itself. In
contrast, knockdown of mll1 or mll2 had minimal effect on WT p53 cancer cells (Extended
Data Fig. 7d, e).

Author Manuscript

We addressed the importance of this pathway to tumor relevant phenotypes, first by
examining the ability of cancer cells to form colonies. Reduction of MLL1 led to decreased
colony formation ability of MDA-MB-468 cells (R273H) (Fig. 4a; Extended Data Fig. 7f),
but had little effect on colony formation efficiency of MCF7 cells (WT) (Fig. 4b; Extended
Data Fig. 7g). Similar results were observed in breast cancer cells BT-549 (R249S) and
pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1 (R273H) (Extended Data Fig. 7h, i). We further confirmed
the tumor formation phenotype in anchorage-independent growth assays in soft agar,
showing that decreasing MLL1 specifically reduced the growth and colony size of GOF p53

cancer cells, but not WT p53 cancer cells (Extended Data Fig. 7j, k). We also investigated
tumor growth on NOD-scid-gamma (NSG) immune-deficient mice. Knockdown of mll1 led
to strongly reduced tumor formation ability in GOF p53 cells, as compared to GOF p53 cells
with non-targeting scrambled control knockdown (Fig. 4c, e). In contrast, mll1 knockdown
did not change tumor formation ability of WT p53 cancer cells (Fig. 4d, e), again supporting
a specific role of MLL1 in cancers with GOF p53, but not WT p53.

To further explore a critical role that these chromatin regulators may play in supporting
growth of GOF p53 cells, and to rule out possible confounding factors in established cancer
cell lines, we performed mll1 knockdown in the primary MEFs with knock-in GOF p53.
Consistently, MLL1 reduction resulted in decreased proliferation of GOF p53 MEFs
(Extended Data Fig. 8a). Importantly, re-expression of MLL1 in GOF p53 MEFs with p53
knockdown partially rescued the growth defects (Fig. 4f); partial rescue likely results from
GOF p53 driving expression of multiple downstream targets, as described above. These
results strongly indicate a direct role of MLL1, functioning downstream of GOF p53 in
maintaining proliferation of GOF p53 cells. We also performed mll1 knockdown (Extended
Data Fig. 8b) in human non-cancer LFS cells – MDAH087 (p53 R248W) and MDAH041
(p53 null27; Extended Data Fig. 8c). Similar to the results obtained in cancer cells and in
MEFs, mll1 knockdown reduced the growth rate of GOF p53 LFS cells (Fig. 4g; Extended
Data Fig. 8d), again phenocopying the knockdown of GOF p53 itself (Extended Data Fig.
8e), but did not reduce the growth of either p53 null LFS cells (Fig. 4h; Extended Data Fig.
8f), nor primary non-cancer cells with WT p53 (IMR90 lung fibroblasts, Extended Data Fig.
8g, h). Re-expression of MLL1 again partially rescued the growth reduction by GOF p53
knockdown in LFS cells (Extended Data Fig. 8i). In addition, mll2 knockdown also
decreased GOF p53 LFS cell proliferation, but not p53 null LFS cells (Extended Data Fig.
8j, k).

COMPASS inhibitors reduce GOF p53 cell growth
Chromatin regulators have emerged as promising targets of small molecule compounds in
various human diseases including cancer11,28. Menin is a scaffold protein of the COMPASS
complex20, directly interacting with the N-terminal of MLL129-31, and is crucial for MLL1
activity and for maintenance of a subtype of leukemia32,33. We treated both GOF p53 and
p53 null LFS cells with the previously reported menin antagonist, MI-2-234,35. In agreement
with the mll1 genetic knockdown experiments, MI-2-2 showed a dose-dependent inhibition
of GOF p53 cell growth (Fig. 5a), but had very little effect on p53 null cells (Fig. 5b).

Author Manuscript

Recently, inhibition of MLL1 function has also been demonstrated by targeting its
interaction with the WDR5 subunit of the COMPASS complex36,37. As a second approach
to pharmacological inhibition of MLL1 activity, we used OICR-9429, a newly characterized
antagonist of interaction of WDR5 with MLL138. This non-peptide, drug-like molecule
binds to WDR5 in the MLL1 binding site of WDR5 (KD = 93 ± 28 nM), and disrupts the
assembly of the WDR5/MLL1/RbBP5 complex in cells with IC50 values below 1 μM38. In
striking similarity to MI-2-2, we found a dose-dependent inhibition by OICR-9429 of GOF
p53 LFS cell growth (Fig. 5c), and, again, little effect on p53 null LFS cells (Fig. 5d).
Moreover, in the genetically controlled MEF cells, we observed similar results, that

OICR-9429 specifically inhibits cell proliferation of GOF p53 MEFs (Fig. 5e, f), but not
when GOF p53 is reduced (Fig. 5e), or in p53 null MEFs (Fig. 5f). These results provide
strong evidence for a specific growth inhibitory effect of pharmacological drugs in targeting
MLL COMPASS complex activity downstream of GOF p53.

We examined the significance of our findings in the context of human tumor samples, by
analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Based on p53 mutational status, we grouped
tumor samples into: (1) WT (no detectable p53 mutation); (2) GOF (missense mutation of
R175H, R248Q, R248W, R249S, or R273H); and (3) p53 null (p53 nonsense mutations or
frameshift truncations). Tumors with other types of p53 mutations (other missense
mutations, inframe insertion/deletion, or splicing mutations) were not included in further
analysis, due to an unpredictable effect on the downstream chromatin regulators. We also
focused our analysis on cancer types that include more than 5% samples in the group
comprising GOF p53. We first combined all samples from these cancer types, and observed
significantly higher RNA expression of mll1, mll2 and moz in GOF p53 tumors, compared to
either WT p53 or p53 null tumors (Fig. 5g, top panels). As controls, expression levels of
housekeeping genes including actin and gapdh are consistent across the three groups (Fig.
5g, middle panels), whereas expression levels of WT p53 targets p21, mdm2 and puma are
significantly higher in the WT p53 group than the GOF p53 or p53 null group (Fig. 5g,
lower panels). Next, we examined individual cancer types and observed similar gene
expression patterns as the combination of all cancers (Extended Data Fig. 9a-f). Notably,
given the heterogeneous population of tumor samples, and the small sample size of certain
groups, not all pairwise comparisons are statistically significant, although the same trends
always hold that GOF p53 tumors express higher levels of mll1, mll2, and moz than the other
two groups. This is also true with canonical WT p53 targets, that is, although not all
comparisons are statistically significant, the WT p53 groups always show higher levels of
p21, mdm2 and puma than the GOF p53 or p53 null tumor groups.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Our results indicate that distinct prevalent GOF p53 mutants bind to a common newly
identified group of gene targets genome-wide, to drive expression of genes comprising a
chromatin signature. The GOF p53 mapping occurs immediately associated with ETS
motifs, and GOF p53 binds directly to ETS2, indicating that the substitutions in the DNA
binding domain of p53 unleash a latent interaction with ETS family transcription factors, as
previously suggested8. Within this chromatin signature gene group targeted by GOF p53, the
COMPASS methyltransferase pathway appears to be particularly well represented, but the
new binding includes other chromatin regulators, such as the acetyltransferase, moz. We find
that expression of these modifying enzymes is dependent on GOF p53, which in turn
elevates activating histone modifications, including H3K4me3 and H3K9ac. Our evidence
points to MLL downstream pathways as key targets of GOF p53. Thus, as is the case in
leukemia bearing translocations of MLL, MLL pathways may contribute to GOF p53
oncogenic phenotypes and therefore cancer progression.
Importantly, our findings in both human cancer cells and LFS cells show that GOF p53 cells
lose growth and tumor formation potential with similar timing kinetics upon knockdown of

mll1 as they do with knockdown of GOF p53. A key comparison - to cancer and LFS cells
that express WT p53 or are null for p53 - shows very little response to mll1 knockdown.
Hence, GOF p53 cells appear exquisitely dependent for growth on the MLL1 pathway. We
provide further evidence of GOF p53 cell growth dependence on the COMPASS complex,
by analyzing cell sensitivity to two different pharmacological small compound inhibitors.
These compounds target menin or WDR5 interaction with MLL1, and inhibit proliferation
of LFS cells and MEFs expressing GOF p53 but not p53 null. The effects of the inhibitors
are thus analogous to direct knockdown of mll1. Hence, we conclude that a large cohort of
GOF p53 driven cancers, not previously known to be growth dependent on chromatin
pathways, may be amenable to epigenetic therapeutics.

Co-Immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

Flag tagged ETS2 protein was transfected (Life Technologeis, #11668019) and expressed in
HEK293T cells, which was then subjected to immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody
conjugated protein G Dynabeads (Life Technologies, #10004D). Following stringent
washes, HA tagged WT or GOF p53 (generated by in vitro translation (Thermo, #88881))
was added to co-immunoprecipitate with Flag-ETS2 in buffer containing: 20 mM Tris, pH
8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitors.
Endogenous co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in buffer containing: 20
mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol,
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and 12.5 U/ml benzonase (Novagen, 70746).
Bacterial expression and GST pulldown

Author Manuscript

GST-tagged ETS2 constructs were transformed and expressed in BL21-CodonPlus E. coli.
Bacterial lysates were incubated with glutathione beads (Life Technologies, #G2879) at 4°C
for 2 hours, and washed 4 times with buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
1% Triton, 1 mM DTT, supplemented with 100 μM PMSF. The in vitro translated (Thermo,
#88881) HA tagged WT or GOF p53 proteins were pre-cleared with GST at 4°C for 1 h and
the resulting supernatant was subjected to GST pulldown with GST or GST-ETS2. The
product was then washed and subjected to western blot analysis.
RT-qPCR, ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-sequencing

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, #74106). RNA was then reverse
transcribed to cNDA (Life Technologies, #4387406), following which qPCR was performed
for quantification using standard procedures on a 7900HT Fast-Real-Time PCR platform
(ABI). ChIP was performed as previously described40, with modifications. In brief, cells
were crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde (Thermo, #28906) in PBS for 10 min at room
temperature. After glycine quenching, cell pellets were collected and lysed as previously
described40, and then subjected to sonication with the Covaris sonicator (S220). The
supernatant was then diluted in the same sonication buffer but without N-Lauroylsarcosine,
and subjected to immunoprecipitation with corresponding antibodies at 4°C overnight. The
beads were then washed and DNA was reverse-crosslinked and purified. Following ChIP,
DNA was quantified by qPCR using standard procedures on a 7900HT Fast-Real-Time PCR
platform (ABI), or sequencing libraries were prepared using NEBNext Ultra library
preparation procedure, and then sequenced on Illumina Hi-Seq platform at the NextGeneration Sequence Core at University of Pennsylvania, or on Illumina Next-Seq platform
in the Epigenetics Program at the University of Pennsylvania. All primer sequences used in
this study are available in Supplementary Table 3.
Growth curve measurement
200,000 cells were seeded on 950 mm2 surface area (one well of 6-well plate) on Day 0.
Cell number was measured every two days with Countess automated cell counter (Life
Technologies) following standard procedure and default parameter settings, after which
200,000 cells were plated back for the next count. For shRNA-mediated knockdown
experiments, cells were seeded seven days after the initial infection of shRNA-containing

lentivirus, during which puromycin selection was completed and cells were returned to
normal growth medium. For small compound inhibitor treatment experiments, inhibitors or
DMSO vehicle control were added on Day 0 as cells were seeded, and refreshed every other
day as cells were counted and replated. All short hairpin sequences used in this study are
available in Supplementary Table 3.
Colony-formation assay
After lentiviral infection of shRNA constructs and puromycin selection, 2000 cells were
seeded per well in 6-well plates. After three weeks, cell colonies were fixed with 1%
paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (for 15 minutes). For quantification,
the crystal violet dye was released into 10% acetic acid and measured at OD590.
Soft agar anchorage-independent growth assay

Author Manuscript

The base layer of soft agar contained complete DMEM media (10% FBS, 100 units per ml
penicillin and 100 μg per ml streptomycin) with 1% agar; the top layer of soft agar contained
complete DMEM media with 0.7% agarose and was mixed with 5000 cells and plated over
the base layer. Colonies were fixed and stained with 0.005% crystal violet (for 1 hour), and
visible colonies were counted.
Tumor xenograft assay

Author Manuscript

4 male and 4 female mice (Mus musculus, strain NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, Jackson
Labs (stock # 005557)) between the ages of 38 and 45 days old were used per treatment for
tumor xenograft experiments. All animal experiments described within adhere to policies
and practices approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Biosafety Committee
(IBC) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committe (IACUC). Cells were harvested
after shRNA (MLL1 or non-targeting control) mediated knockdowns. 1.5 million cells were
injected subcutaneously per mouse. Tumor size was measured by calipers ten weeks after
subcutaneous injection. Tumor size was measured in two dimensions, and tumor volume
was calculated as: ½ × Length × Width2. All mice were euthanized twenty weeks after
subcutaneous injection. Tumors were then excised and photographed.
ChIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing analysis

Author Manuscript

Human cell sequencing reads were aligned to human genome hg18 using Bowtie241. For
p53 ChIP-seq, significant regions of enrichment (peaks) were called using HOMER (Salk
Institute, http://homer.salk.edu). For area under the curve analysis, ChIP-seq tags from each
cell line were counted at TSS proximal peaks (+/−200bp around peak centers) of every cell
line (including itself) as indicated. Heat maps of p53 enrichment across a 5kb region (−/+
2.5kb from peak center, bin=10) in MCF7, MDA-MB-175VII, MDA-MB-468, HCC70,
BT-549 cell lines were generated using HOMER and visualized using JavaTreeView.
Sequencing reads from MEFs ChIP-seq experiments were aligned to the mouse reference
genome mm9 using Bowtie2. Strand-specific mouse RNA-seq experiments were aligned to
the mm9 reference genome and reference transcriptome. FPKM expression values were
counted for each exon and merged into a single gene model using HOMER.

Motif analysis

Author Manuscript

To determine associated sequence motifs for WT p53 or GOF p53 peaks, all TSS proximal
peaks (filtered to remove peaks overlapping with satellite DNA) were pared down to the
central 50bp and used as input to MEME and the SeqPos utility in Cistrome (central 100bp
as required by SeqPos). MEME was instructed to search for the top 10 motifs appearing 0 or
more times in each sequence, and SeqPos was run with default parameters.
Gene ontology analysis

Author Manuscript

GO terms associated with WT p53 or GOF p53 binding sites were determined in the
following way. ChIP-seq TSS proximal peaks were associated with the nearest ENSEMBL
transcript and processed using DAVID. The FDR was controlled at 1% and GO terms with
fewer than 5 associated transcripts or a fold-enrichment over the genomic background under
5-fold were discarded.
Intersection with ENCODE transcription factor datasets
Transcription factor peak coordinates (hg18 assembly) were obtained from the ENCODE
project repository (www.encodeproject.org) in BED format. TSS proximal p53 ChIP-seq
peak regions were intersected with all transcription factor binding site data using BEDTools,
with overlap inferred if a minimum of a single base pair was in common.
TCGA analysis

Author Manuscript

Exome sequencing and RNA sequencing datasets were obtained from TCGA (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). Based on p53 mutational status from the exome sequencing datasets,
we grouped tumor samples into: (1) WT (tumors without detectable p53 mutation); (2) GOF
(tumors with p53 single missense mutation of R175H, R248Q, R248W, R249S, or R273H);
and (3) Null (tumors with p53 nonsense mutations or frameshift truncations). Tumors with
other types of p53 mutations (other missense mutations, inframe insertion/deletion, or
splicing mutations) were not included in further analysis, due to an unpredictable effect on
the downstream chromatin regulators. Cancer types that include more than 5% samples in
group 2 were included for the combined analysis, in which RNA expression values were
normalized to the WT group median. For individual cancer type analysis, original RNA
expression values (normalized read counts or RPKM values) from TCGA datasets were
used.
OICR-9429

Author Manuscript

OCIR-9429 was developed using structure-guided medicinal chemistry and peptide
displacement assays starting from ‘Compound 3’ previously reported in Senisterra et al42, as
part of the Chemical Probe Program of the Structural Genomics Consortium. OICR-9429 is
highly specific for WDR5 and was shown to have >100-fold selectivity over 300 other
chromatin “reader” domains, methyl-transferases, and other non-epigenetic targets. The
details of its structure, discovery and characterization are described in Grebien et al38.
