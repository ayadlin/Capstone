ABSTRACT
The actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are critically important for cancer cell
proliferation, and drugs that target microtubules are widely-used cancer therapies.
However, their utility is compromised by toxicities due to dose and exposure. To
overcome these issues, we characterized how inhibition of the actin and microtubule
cytoskeleton regulatory LIM kinases could be used in drug combinations to increase
efficacy. A previously-described LIMK inhibitor (LIMKi) induced dose-dependent
microtubule alterations that resulted in significant mitotic defects, and increased the
cytotoxic potency of microtubule polymerization inhibitors. By combining LIMKi with
366 compounds from the GSK Published Kinase Inhibitor Set, effective combinations
were identified with kinase inhibitors including EGFR, p38 and Raf. These findings
encouraged a drug discovery effort that led to development of CRT0105446 and
CRT0105950, which potently block LIMK1 and LIMK2 activity in vitro, and inhibit
cofilin phosphorylation and increase αTubulin acetylation in cells. CRT0105446 and
CRT0105950 were screened against 656 cancer cell lines, and rhabdomyosarcoma,
neuroblastoma and kidney cancer cells were identified as significantly sensitive to
both LIMK inhibitors. These large-scale screens have identified effective LIMK inhibitor
drug combinations and sensitive cancer types. In addition, the LIMK inhibitory
compounds CRT0105446 and CRT0105950 will enable further development of LIMKtargeted cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

of elevated expression in various cancer types, research
has largely focussed on their roles in tumor cell migration,
invasion and metastasis [7-9]. More recent studies
have shown that the LIM kinases modulate additional
activities that contribute to cancer development, including
cell proliferation and survival [4-6]. LIMK activity
also contributes to cancer cell resistance to various
chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation, while
blocking LIMK activity reverses this resistance or even

The LIM kinases 1 and 2 (LIMK1 and LIMK2)
are central regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics [1,
2]. Although their regulation of cofilin activity and
filamentous actin (F-actin) stability have been extensively
studied [3], they also contribute to microtubule dynamics
via less well characterized mechanisms [4-6]. Given
their cytoskeleton-associated functions and indications

increases sensitivity [10-14]. These observations have
spurred efforts directed towards the discovery of LIMK
inhibitors as potential cancer therapeutic agents that
could be used as single agents or as part of combination
therapies [15-17].
In recent years, the focus of cancer drug discovery
has evolved from developing chemotherapeutics that
could be widely-used across multiple cancers to treatments
tailored for specific tumor types. In particular, this has led
to the development of targeted therapies that utilise unique
molecular properties identified in malignant cells to
preferentially target tumor cells, while reducing potential
detrimental effects on normal cells [18]. However,
molecularly-targeted therapies have not been as successful
as originally anticipated, with high rates of failure and
limited numbers of patients that manifest positive clinical
responses.
In order to improve chances for targeted therapy
success, two strategies have been considered. Firstly, as
an alternative or complement to molecularly-targeted
therapies, other proteins or biological processes may
be important targets because of accessory or auxiliary
functions they provide. For example, stresses induced
by oncogenic transformation often lead to reliance upon
heat-shock protein chaperones, such that inhibition of
heat shock proteins including Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hsp27
has become a large area of cancer drug development
[19]. Similarly, associations between human cancers and
alterations in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons
have been well documented [20], suggesting that drugs
targeting cytoskeleton regulators might be efficacious for
the treatment of certain tumor types [15-17]. Unbiased
screening may reveal drug sensitivities that reflect
dependence on these auxiliary functions that would not be
identified by genetic profiling.
A number of small molecule LIMK inhibitors have
been discovered [6, 21-25] and several have been reported
to be efficacious as single agent therapeutics on cancer
cells including: breast [6, 26], pancreatic [27], prostate
[5], cervical adenocarcinoma [6], fibromatosis [28],
leukemia [4, 6] and glioma [29]. To identify how LIMK
inhibitors might best be utilized, we carried out two cellbased screens. In the first, a LIMK inhibitor was combined
with microtubule-targeting drugs, or the GSK published
kinase inhibitor set (PKIS) of 366 small molecule kinase
inhibitors [30], to identify combinations with positive
interactions. In the second, two novel LIMK inhibitors
we developed were used to screen 656 tumor cell lines to
identify cancer types with significant sensitivity to their
anti-proliferative effects. These large-scale and unbiased
cell-based screens revealed a range of drug combinations
that could be considered for further development, and
identified tumor types with significant sensitivity to LIMK
inhibition.

LIMK inhibition affects microtubule organization
and mitosis
To determine how LIMK inhibition affects cancer
cell proliferation, we made use of the small molecular
inhibitor N-{5-[2-(2,6-Dichloro-phenyl)-5-difluoromethyl2H-pyrazol-3-yl]-thiazol-2-yl}-isobutyramide (compound
3 in [21]; hereafter referred to as LIMKi) that blocks both
LIMK1 (7 nM IC50 in vitro) and LIMK2 (8 nM IC50)
activity. The results of selectivity profiling of LIMKi
at 10 µM against 287 kinases [21] using KINOMEscan
technology [31] was mapped onto a kinome phylogenetic
tree [32] in Supplemental Figure 1A. To compare
specificity quantitatively, the LIMKi S(35) selectivity
score (a ratio of kinases inhibited by > 65% relative to
the total number of kinases) was compared to S(35)
values for 38 additional kinase inhibitors, including 7
FDA licenced drugs, at 10 µM (Supplemental Figure 1B;
LIMKi indicated in blue). Furthermore, the inset graph in
Supplemental Figure 1B of LIMKi S(1) (i.e. proportion of
kinases inhibited by 99%), S(10) (proportion of kinases
inhibited by 90%) and S(35) selectivity scores indicates
the high selectivity of LIMKi. At 10 µM LIMKi, only
13 kinase targets (ADCK3, ALK4, AMPKα1, AMPKα2,
BRSK1, BRSK2, DCAMKL1, DCAMKL2, DDR1,
FGFR1, PAK3, PCTAIRE1) in addition to LIMK1 and
LIMK2 were inhibited by > 65% [21]. We validated the
dose-dependent effect of LIMKi on inhibiting LIMK
activity by treating A549 human lung adenocarcinoma
epithelial cells for 18 hours with DMSO vehicle or 1,
3 or 10 µM LIMKi [9, 21] and western blotting for
phosphorylation of cofilin, a well-characterized LIMK
substrate [9] (Figure 1A). We next examined how
microtubule organization was affected by LIMKi in nondividing cells by treating A549 cells for 24 hours with
DMSO vehicle or 3 or 10 µM LIMKi. Representative
images show progressive changes in microtubule
morphology with increasing LIMKi dose (Figure 1B).
To determine whether this effect was associated with
changes in microtubule stability, we analysed the effect of
LIMKi on αTubulin acetylation [33]. Confocal images of
A549 cells co-stained with antibodies against acetylatedαTubulin (Figure 1C; green) and total αTubulin (Figure
1C; red) revealed a concentration-dependent increase
in αTubulin acetylation after 24-hour LIMKi treatment.
Quantification of fluorescence intensities revealed a
moderate increase in αTubulin acetylation in response
to 3 μM LIMKi, and a significant increase in response
to 10 µM LIMKi treatment, relative to DMSO vehicle
control. These results indicate that the LIMK inhibitor
affected microtubule organization and post-translational
modification.

To investigate the role of LIMK in mitosis,
we analyzed the effect of LIMKi on mitotic spindle
morphology. A549 cells were treated for 24 hours with
DMSO vehicle, 3 or 10 μM LIMKi, then fixed and
stained with αTubulin antibody and the DNA stain
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). We observed
significant alterations in spindle microtubule structure
and organization with increasing LIMKi concentrations,
including; decreased or complete loss of aster
microtubules, defects in spindle microtubule integrity,
defects in microtubule polymerization, or the appearance
of monoastral spindles (Figure 2). To quantify these
effects, > 10 representative mitotic cells per treatment were
morphologically characterised for the above abnormalities
and the percentage occurrence of each microtubule defect
in three independent replicate experiments was determined
(Figure 2). The occurrence of microtubule defects during
mitosis progressively increased with increasing LIMKi
concentration, with significant decreases in the percentage
of normal cells with increasing LIMKi concentration
(Figure 2). Therefore, we concluded that treatment with a
LIMK inhibitory compound had a strong effect on cancer
cell mitosis.
Consistent with the sensitivity of A549 cells to
LIMKi, active phosphorylated LIM kinases have been
previously found to co-localise with γTubulin at mitotic
cell centrosomes [34]. To test if LIMK activity was

important for active LIMK localization and mitotic
spindle assembly, we tested the effect of LIMKi on
active phosphorylated LIMK (p-LIMK) and γTubulin colocalization in mitotic A549 cells (Figure 3A). Treatment
with 3 µM LIMKi had no effect on p-LIMK localization,
indicating that p-LIMK localization to centrosomes is
independent from LIMK activity (Figure 3B). Consistent
with previous results [12], 3 µM LIMKi eliminated
basal and induced cofilin phosphorylation, indicating
inhibition of LIMK activity, while only slightly reducing
LIMK phosphorylation (Figure 3C). Treatment with a
low concentration of the vinca alkaloid Vincristine (5
nM), which did not detectably affect spindle morphology
[35] had a small effect on p-LIMK and γTubulin colocalization (Figure 3B). The combination of 5 nM
Vincristine and 3 µM LIMKi had a significant effect on
p-LIMK and γTubulin co-localization greater than DMSO
vehicle or Vincristine alone (Figure 3B). Moreover,
immunofluorescence images show that combined LIMKi
and vincristine treatment also had the strongest effect on
spindle integrity, indicating possible co-operation between
microtubules and LIMK function in mitosis (Figure 3A).

Figure 2: LIMK inhibition affects microtubule assembly in mitotic spindles. A549 cells were treated as indicated for 24

hours, then fixed and stained for DNA with DAPI (blue) and αTubulin (red) antibody. Representative images of each type of mitotic defect
observed are presented. For each condition, > 10 randomly selected metaphase cells were scored per indicated treatment. Scale bar = 10
µm. Statistical significance of changes in normal mitosis incidence were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison
post-hoc test (mean + SEM, n = 3).

on counting remaining cell number, there was a ~2 fold
decrease in Vincristine EC50 in the presence of LIMKi,
indicating a synergistic cooperation between Vincristine
and LIMKi (Figure 4A). By comparing the effects of
fixed ratios of Vincristine (0.625-5 nM) and LIMKi (2.520 µM) concentrations on cell viability as determined
by CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, an
average Combination Index of 0.77 + 0.02 indicating
synergy was determined by the Chou-Talalay method
[36] for LIMKi concentrations < 10 µM (Figure 4B).
Furthermore, there was ~2-fold difference in Vincristine
EC50 between spontaneously immortalized wild-type (WT)
and Limk2-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts as determined
by counting remaining cells (Figure 4C). To determine
how the combined treatment of LIMKi and Vincristine
decreased cell numbers, we profiled DNA content by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of propidium
iodide (PI) stained cells. The proportions of cells with 4N
DNA content, indicative of G2/M cell cycle phases, were
progressively increased with Vincristine concentration
when combined with 3 µM LIMKi (Figure 4D, left panel)
or with increased LIMKi concentration when combined
with 5 nM Vincristine (Figure 4D, right panel) relative to
DMSO vehicle control. In addition, the proportion of < 2N
DNA content, typically a reflection of DNA fragmentation
during apoptosis, progressively increased with increased
Vincristine concentration when combined with 3 µM
LIMKi (Figure 4E, left panel) or with increased LIMKi
concentration when combined with 5 nM Vincristine
(Figure 4E, right panel) relative to DMSO vehicle control.
Taken together, these results indicate that the combined
effect of LIMKi and a microtubule polymerization
inhibitor was at least partially due to impaired mitosis,
leading to impaired G2/M cell cycle progression and
subsequent apoptosis.
To determine whether this effect was specific for
Vincristine, we tested additional microtubule-targeting
drugs with and without LIMKi. The microtubule
polymerization inhibitors Vinorelbine (Figure 4F) and
Colchicine (Figure 4G) had similar ~2-fold decreases in
EC50 in the presence of LIMKi. These results indicate that
LIMKi synergizes with agents that target microtubule
polymerization.

compounds in the presence of 3 μM LIMKi or DMSO.
Compounds having either no cytotoxic effect (Figure 5A),
or an effect that did not reach 50% alone (Figure 5B), but
achieved more than 50% reduction in relative cell number
when combined with 3 µM LIMKi were selected as 20
hits (Supplemental Table 1). Compounds that produced
a greater than 2-fold decrease in absolute EC50 when
combined with 3 µM LIMKi (Figure 5C) were selected
as 43 additional hits (Figure 5D; Supplemental Table 2).
Remaining compounds either did not fit these criteria
selection criteria (Supplemental Table 3) or were without
combination effects (Supplemental Table 4).
To identify common drug targets from the selected
hits, kinase inhibitor selectivity data for the 63 hits from
GSK were clustered by pairwise average-linkage cluster
analysis with the dot product distance option using TM4
[37] (Figure 5E), with color gradations ranging from 0%
(black) to 100% inhibition (yellow). Amongst the most
frequently occurring designated targets were VEGFR or
VEGFR/TIE2, GSK3, AKT, CDK2 and IGF1R. However,
the broad specificity of these inhibitors makes it difficult
to draw conclusions about the contributions of individual
kinases to the observed combination effects. In contrast,
there were some clusters of kinase inhibitors with narrow
selectivity profiles that highlight certain kinase targets as
possibly indicating biological interactions with LIMK
signaling, including PLK1, RAF, EGFR/ErbB2 and p38.
These results indicate that there may be mechanism-based
effective drug combinations with LIMK inhibitors, in
addition to microtubule polymerization inhibitors, that
could be characterized further for potential clinical use.

Discovery of novel LIMK inhibitors
Given the potential for the use of LIMK inhibitors
as cancer chemotherapeutics, a high-throughput drug
discovery and medicinal chemistry program was
undertaken. Details of the screening methodology and
description of initial hit matter were described in [38].
Following iterative rounds of lead optimization medicinal
chemistry and in vitro enzyme assays, two compounds
were developed with potent LIMK inhibitory activity;
N-{5-[3-(4-Methoxy-2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyridin4-yl]-hiazol-2-yl}-isobutyramide (CRT0105446; Figure
6A) and 4-{5-[3-(2-Chloro-4-methyl-phenyl)-pyridin-4yl]-thiazol-2-ylamino}-phenol (CRT0105950; Figure 6B).
Details of their chemical synthesis are described in Charles
et al. [39]. The in vitro IC50 values for LIMK1 and LIMK2
were 8 nM and 32 nM respectively for CRT0105446,
and 0.3 nM and 1 nM respectively for CRT0105950.
These and additional physiochemical parameters are in
Supplemental Table 5. Kinase selectivity was profiled
for 442 kinases using KINOMEscan technology [31] at
10 µM CRT0105446 and CRT0105950 (Supplemental

tree [32] in Figure 6A and 6B. To compare specificity

LIMKi potentiates kinase inhibitor reductions in

Given the consistent positive interactions between
LIMKi and microtubule polymerization inhibitors, we
wished to determine whether other cancer drug targets
would also combine with LIMK inhibition to block
cancer cell proliferation. A high-throughput screen was
undertaken using the GSK published kinase inhibitor set
(PKIS) of 366 small molecule kinase inhibitors [30]. A549

acetylation and three-dimensional (3-D) extracellular

potent at increasing αTubulin acetylation (Figure 7A)
and decreasing cofilin phosphorylation (Figure 7B) in
A549 lung cancer cells. To more precisely determine cell-

based LIMK inhibitor activity, MCF7 breast cancer cells
were treated with 2 µg/mL doxorubicin, which strongly
increases cofilin phosphorylation through increased
p53-mediated transcription of LIMK2 and RhoC genes
[12] to increase the dynamic range and signal-to-noise
ratio of the assay, and varying concentrations of LIMK
inhibitors for 18 hr, then cells were fixed and stained for
immunofluorescence determination of phosphorylated
cofilin intensity. Dose-response analysis revealed that all
three compounds inhibited cofilin phosphorylation, with
LIMKi being ~2-fold more potent than CRT0105950 and
7-fold more potent than CRT0105446 in this assay format
(Figure 7C). We additionally established that LIMK
inhibition resulted in decreased cofilin phosphorylation
in MDAMB231 human breast cancer cells by comparing
the effect of a range of LIMKi and CRT0105950
concentrations on phospho-cofilin levels. As shown
in Figures 7D and 7E, both inhibitors induced dosedependent decreases in cofilin phosphorylation. Finally,
the inverse invasion of 3-D matrigel by MDAMB231
breast cancer cells above a 60 µm cut-off was significantly
inhibited by 3 µM LIMKi, CRT0105446 and CRT0105950
(Figure 7F), consistent with our previous observations
using LIMKi [9]. These results are consistent with all
three inhibitors being potent inhibitors of LIMK activity
in cells.

types that were significantly sensitive or resistant to
both drugs are indicated with red dots, while those
cancer types significantly affected by CRT0105446 are
depicted with orange dots and those significantly affected
by CRT0105950 are shown with green dots. Deming
regression indicates that the slope of a fitted line was
significantly different from 0, indicating that there was
a direct relationship between cancer type responses to
both drugs. This analysis revealed that neuroblastoma,
rhabdomyosarcoma and kidney cancer cells were
significantly sensitive to both LIMK inhibitors, with 6
additional cancer types being sensitive to either inhibitor
and trending towards sensitivity to the other (e.g. Ewing’s
sarcoma, osteosarcoma and additional soft tissue cancer
cell lines). Burkitt lymphoma and B cell lymphoma
were the only significantly resistant cancer types, with 4
additional cancer types being sensitive to either inhibitor
and trending towards sensitivity towards the other (e.g.
Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma).
To validate the sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to
LIMK inhibitors, we tested 6 neuroblastoma cell lines for
their responses to LIMKi (Figure 10A). When the mean
natural log EC50 values of LIMKi for these 6 cell lines
were compared to CRT0105950 and CRT0105446 EC50
values for the 27 neuroblastoma cell lines from the screen,
both LIMKi and CRT0105950 were significantly more
effective than CRT0105446 but were not different from
each other (Figure 10B), consistent with their rank order
of potencies for inhibition of cofilin phosphorylation,
tubulin acetylation and matrix invasion (Figure 7).
To corroborate the requirement for LIMK activity in
neuroblastoma cells, we knocked down LIMK1 and
LIMK2, either by combining two siRNA oligonucleotides
(LIMK1+LIMK2) or using an siRNA oligonucleotide
(panLIMK) that reduces expression of both proteins, in
SK-N-AS and SK-N-SH cells (Figure 10C). Relative to a
non-targeting control (NTC) oligonucleotide, both forms
of LIMK knockdown significantly reduced neuroblastoma
cell viability in SK-N-AS cells (Figure 10D) and SK-NSH cells (Figure 10E).

Identification of cancer cells sensitive to LIMK
inhibitors
To identify cancer cell types with significant
sensitivity to chemical LIMK inhibitors, a screen
was performed on 656 cancer cell lines [40] with
CRT0105950 and CRT0105446. Each inhibitor was
tested at concentrations from 0.3-10 µM, and cell
numbers determined as described in [40]. By comparing
calculated EC50 values for cell lines (Supplemental Tables
7-8) within a given cancer type against all cancer cell
lines (Supplemental Table 9-10), significantly (p < 0.05)
sensitive and resistant cancer types were identified. Figure
8A shows natural log EC50 values (in µM) of CRT0105950
for each cell line within each cancer type, with a red line
indicating mean EC50 and arranged in order of their mean
EC50 from low to high values. Relative to the mean EC50
of CRT0105950 for all cancer cell lines (19.2 µM), there
were 5 cancer types that were significantly sensitive and 5
cancer types that were significantly resistant (shown with
green dots). Similarly, 3 cancer types were significantly
sensitive and 5 were significantly resistant (Figure 8B,
orange dots), relative to the mean EC50 of all cancer cells
to CRT0105446 (238 µM).
	 To determine which cancer types were most
likely affected by the on-target effects of CRT0105446
and CRT0105950, we plotted the mean EC50 values
for both drugs of each cancer type (Figure 9). Cancer

DISCUSSION
The LIM kinases have well characterized roles in
regulating the actin cytoskeleton through their regulation
of cofilin activity, and consequently have been regarded
as potential targets for anti-metastasis therapy [1, 15,
41]. It has recently emerged that LIMK1 and LIMK2
also influence microtubule dynamics and have important
functions in mitosis [4, 5, 13], which is consistent with
LIMK inhibitors being potential cancer therapeutics. In the
present study, the effect of inhibiting LIMK activity on
microtubule structures and mitosis has been validated, and
combinations with microtubule destabilizing drugs shown
to act synergistically. By screening the PKIS compound
library, additional potential drug combinations with

Figure 8: Evaluation of cancer cell line sensitivities to LIMK inhibitors. A. A total of 656 cancer cell lines, divided into 54

cancer types, were treated with 9 concentrations of a 2-fold dilution series of CRT0105950 (top concentration = 10 μM). After 72 hours,
cell density was measured, EC50 values calculated and MANOVA performed to identify cancer types significantly (p < 0.05; green dots)
sensitive or resistant to CRT109590 relative to all cancers considered together. Red lines indicate mean EC50 for each cancer type, and red
dotted line showing mean EC50 for all cancers. B. Sensitivity or resistance to CRT0105446 was determined as described above. Cancer
types significantly (p < 0.05) different from all cancers indicated with orange dots.

LIMK inhibition were identified, including EGFR and
Raf kinases. Previous research on the chemosensitivity
of 39 human cancer cell lines to 55 anti-cancer
drugs revealed that elevated LIMK2 expression was
significantly correlated to resistance to 18 drugs (including
topoisomerase I inhibitors, bleomycin derivatives and
anthracyclines such as doxorubicin) independent of the
tissue of origin [10]. We also showed that DNA damaging
agents induce LIMK2 expression via p53, while inhibition
or knockdown of LIMK2 activity increased sensitivity
to these chemotherapeutics [12]. Taken together, these
findings are consistent with LIMK activity being an

important contributory factor to drug resistance.
To identify cancer types sensitive to LIMK
inhibition, 656 cancer cell lines were screened with dose
ranges of CRT0105446 and CRT0105950 that enabled
statistical comparison of drug sensitivity. Three cancer
types were significantly sensitive to both LIMK inhibitors;
rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and kidney cancer.
Interestingly, previous research showed that neuroblastoma
cells selected for resistance to Vincristine had increased
LIMK2 expression, while LIMK2 knockdown led to the
formation of abnormal mitotic spindles and sensitized
neuroblastoma cells to Vincristine and Vinblastine [13].

Figure 9: Comparison of cancer cell line sensitivities to LIMK inhibitors. The mean EC50 values for each cancer type to
CRT0105950 and CRT0105446 were plotted, with mean EC50 for all cancers indicated as a dotted green line for CRT0105950 and an orange
dotted line for CRT0105446. Red dots indicate cancer types significantly (p < 0.05) resistant or sensitive to both inhibitors, while green
dots indicate sensitivity or resistance to CRT0105950 alone and orange dots indicate sensitivity or resistance to only CRT0105446. Deming
regression indicates that there is a significant (p = 0.0293) relationship between the sensitivities to both drugs.

Immunofluorescence image quantification

Furthermore, LIMK2 knockdown increased cell cycle
arrest apoptosis induced by microtubule targeting drugs
[11]. These results are consistent with a prominent role for
LIMK signalling in neuroblastoma.
The two novel LIMK inhibitors described in the
present study, CRT0105446 and CRT0105950, are potent
inhibitors of LIMK1 and LIMK2 that will enable further
development of LIMK-targeted cancer therapy.

Immunofluorescence intensity of acetylatedαTubulin was quantified in ImageJ using fixed intensity
threshold, and normalized to total αTubulin. Colocalization analysis was performed on ten mitotic cell
images per treatment per experiment using Volocity
(PerkinElmer). Pearson correlation of protein colocalization was quantified for each cell analysed.
To quantify mitotic cell morphological changes,
pictures of > 10 randomly-selected cells in metaphase
were taken per treatment per experiment and scored
based on their morphology as indicated. Percentages of
cells with each defect were quantified for each treatment
condition and reported as mean + SEM from triplicate
determinations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell line culture and validation
A549 non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma,
MDAMB231 and MCF7 breast cancer and neuroblastoma
cell lines (MHH-NB-11, LAN-6, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-BE-2c,
SK-N-AS, SK-N-SH, SK-N-MC, IMR-32) were cultured
according to ATCC guidelines. Cell identities were
validated using the GenePrint 10 system STR multiplex
assay (Promega) that amplifies 9 tetranucleotide repeat
loci and Amelogenin gender determining marker.

Cytotoxicity assay
A549 cells were plated in 96-well plates at 2000
cells per well, 24 hours before treatment. Cells were
treated with serial dilutions of indicated compounds
alone or in the presence of 3 µM LIMKi or DMSO,
for 72 hours. Surviving cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with 250 ng/ml DAPI.
Experiments were repeated with three independent
replicate experiments. Nuclei were imaged on a High
Content Imaging Operetta system (PerkinElmer) and
quantified using Harmony® High Content Imaging and
Analysis Software (PerkinElmer). Cell numbers were
plotted as percent change from DMSO-treated control and
EC50 values were calculated from dose-response curves
using Prism 5 (GraphPad). Drug combination synergy
was determined by treating cells with serial dilutions
of LIMKi (2.5-20 µM) and Vincristine (0.625-5 nM)
alone or in 4X4 combinations, and quantifying cells 72
hours using CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability
Assay (Promega), following manufacturer’s protocol.
Combination index and effect parameters were determined
with CalcuSyn [36]. Neuroblastoma cell viability was
quantified using CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability
Assay (Promega), following manufacturer’s protocol.

Antibodies
αTubulin (Sigma, Cell Signaling Technology),
acetylated-αTubulin (Novus Biologicals), pLIMK (Thr508
- LIMK1, Thr505 - LIMK2; Abcam or Cell Signaling
Technology), γTubulin (Sigma), phospho-cofilin (Ser3;
Cell Signaling Technology), cofilin (Abcam) and ERK2
(Ab122; CJ Marshall, Institute of Cancer Research,
London).

Western blotting
Cells were lysed with 500 µl of lysis buffer (1x Trisbuffered saline (TBS), 1% Triton-X, 1 nM EDTA, 0.2
mM Na3VO4, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, and cOmplete
Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) per 10 cm
plate. Lysates were cleared by 10-minute centrifugation
and Western blotted [12] with corresponding antibodies.
Quantification of Western blots was performed directly
without signal amplification or X-ray film using infrared emitting secondary antibodies and detection with an
ODYSSEY® infrared imaging system (LI-COR).

Sub-G1 and G2/M quantification
Cells were plated in 6 well plates at 5x105 cells/well
and treated the next day with indicated drugs for 72 hours.
Percentage cells with sub-G1 DNA content or in G2/M
phase were measured and analyzed as described [12].

Immunofluorescence
Cells were plated on glass coverslips, 24 hours
after treatment, cells were fixed and antibody stained as
described [9]. Images were acquired on a Zeiss710 laserscanning confocal microscope and processed in ZEN2010
(Zeiss).

were treated with serial dilutions of indicated compounds
(ranging from 0.005 to 10 µM in half-log dilutions)
alone or in the presence of 3 µM LIMKi or DMSO, for
72 hours. Vincristine was used as a positive control and
DMSO (final 0.4%) was used as a negative control. Cells
were fixed, stained with DAPI, and nuclei of surviving
cells quantified as in the cytotoxicity assay. Results were
plotted as percent change in cell number relative to the
median DMSO alone-treated cell number and absolute
EC50 values were calculated for each compound in the
presence of LIMKi or DMSO control using the Vortex
software analysis program.

SK-N-AS or SK-N-SH cells were transiently
transfected in suspension with indicated siRNA
oligonucleotides at 25 nmoles per well, using
DreamFectTM Gold transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences)
according to manufacturer’s instructions, and plated at
500 cells per well in 96-well plates and incubated for
72 hours for determination of cell viability by CellTiterGlo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. LIMK1 and
LIMK2 ON-TARGETplus siRNA SMARTpools (Thermo
Scientific); pan-LIMK siRNA, sense strand sequence:
5’-AGGCTATCAAGGTGACACA-3’; NTC (nontargeting control) siRNA - (Thermo Scientific). For knockdown validation, 4,000 transfected cells from each assay
were plated in 24-well plates and lysed after 72 hours.
LIMK1 and LIMK2 protein levels were determined by
Western blotting, with αTubulin blotting allowing for
comparison of protein loading.

Kinase selectivity profiling
Selectivity profiling was undertaken by Ambit (now
DiscoveRx) as described in [42].

Statistical analysis

Cofilin phosphorylation quantification

All other statistical analyses were performed with
Prism5 (GraphPad).

MCF7 human breast cancer cells were plated at
5x103 cells/well in black polystyrene glass-bottomed
96 well plates and treated the next day with 0.2 µg/mL
doxorubicin plus indicated LIMK inhibitor concentrations
for 18 hours. Cells were washed, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton
X-100 (v/v) and blocked for 1 hour with 1% BSA (w/v).
Fixed cells were stained with rabbit antibody against
phospho-Ser3 cofilin, then Alexa 488 anti-rabbit antibody
(Invitrogen), Texas red Phalloidin (Molecular Probes)
and DAPI (Sigma). After washing, cells were imaged on
a High Content Imaging Operetta system (PerkinElmer)
and phospho-Ser3 cofilin fluorescence intensity for each
cell quantified using Harmony® High Content Imaging
and Analysis Software (PerkinElmer), and plotted as
percent change from DMSO alone-treated control for
eight independent replicate determinations. EC50 values
were calculated from dose-response curves using Prism
5 (GraphPad).
