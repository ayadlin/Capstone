Abstract
To identify therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for basal breast cancers, breast cancer cell lines were
subjected to mass spectrometry–based profiling of protein tyrosine phosphorylation events. This revealed that
luminal and basal breast cancer cells exhibit distinct tyrosine phosphorylation signatures that depend on
pathway activation as well as protein expression. Basal breast cancer cells are characterized by elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of Met, Lyn, EphA2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and FAK, and Src family
kinase (SFK) substrates such as p130Cas. SFKs exert a prominent role in these cells, phosphorylating key regulators of adhesion and migration and promoting tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinases
EGFR and Met. Consistent with these observations, SFK inhibition attenuated cellular proliferation, survival,
and motility. Basal breast cancer cell lines exhibited differential responsiveness to small molecule inhibitors of
EGFR and Met that correlated with the degree of target phosphorylation, and reflecting kinase coactivation,
inhibiting two types of activated network kinase (e.g., EGFR and SFKs) was more effective than single agent
approaches. FAK signaling enhanced both proliferation and invasion, and Lyn was identified as a proinvasive
component of the network that is associated with a basal phenotype and poor prognosis in patients with
breast cancer. These studies highlight multiple kinases and substrates for further evaluation as therapeutic
targets and biomarkers. However, they also indicate that patient stratification based on expression/activation
of drug targets, coupled with use of multi-kinase inhibitors or combination therapies, may be required for
effective treatment of this breast cancer subgroup. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9391–401. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Gene expression profiling has revealed five breast cancer
subtypes that differ in their prognosis and therapeutic responsiveness: luminal A and B [both estrogen receptor
(ER)–positive], erbB2 (also known as HER2), basal and
normal-like (ER-negative; ref. 1) subtypes. Of these, the erbB2
and basal subsets exhibit the shortest overall and relapse-free
survival. The basal subtype accounts for 10% to 27% of breast
cancer cases, depending on the patient population (2, 3). The
common absence of ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and

erbB2 in this subgroup, or “triple-negative” phenotype, leads
to clinical resistance to endocrine and trastuzumab-based
therapies (2). In addition, basal breast cancers exhibit heterogeneity in terms of prognosis, but markers that accurately
stratify patients at primary diagnosis are currently unavailable (2). Consequently, critical issues facing the clinician
are the lack of targeted treatment strategies and prognostic
markers for this patient subset.
Approximately half of the tyrosine kinase complement of
the human “kinome” is implicated in human cancers (4), and
provides important targets for cancer treatment, as well as
biomarkers for patient stratification. Characterization of tyrosine kinase signaling networks has been greatly facilitated
by recent advances in mass spectrometry–based phosphoproteomics (5). In the current manuscript, we have used
mass spectrometry–based phosphoproteomic profiling to
characterize the tyrosine kinase signaling networks associated with different breast cancer subgroups. This has revealed
a tyrosine phosphorylation signature that characterizes the
basal phenotype, and identified a prominent Src family kinase (SFK) signaling network in basal breast cancer cells.
These findings provide important insights into the biology
of basal breast cancers and have significant implications
for the development of therapeutic strategies that target this
disease subtype.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
All cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection, except for MDA-MB-231 and T-47D
(EG&G Mason Research Institute) and MCF-7 (Michigan
Cancer Foundation). Cell lines were authenticated by short
tandem repeat polymorphism, single nucleotide polymorphism, and fingerprint analyses, passaged for less than 6
months, and cultured as previously described (6, 7).
Phosphoproteomic profiling
Phosphopeptide immunoprecipitation was performed as
described (5). Immunoprecipitated peptides were dissolved
in 1% (v/v) formic acid, 0.05% (v/v) heptafluorobutyric acid.
For each mass spectrometry measurement, the samples were
separated by nano-LC using an Ultimate 3000 HPLC and
autosampler system (Dionex) and mass spectra were collected with an LTQ FT Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron). Peak lists were created from the raw data using the
Mascot Distiller algorithm version 2.2.1.0 (Matrix Science).
The Mascot Daemon tool version 2.2.0 (Matrix Science)
was used to search the peak lists against an in-house
sequence database extracted from ftp://ftp.expasy.org/
databases/uniprot/knowledgebase (release date December 19,
2008), with Homo sapiens set for taxonomy (20,411 sequences). Final filtering criteria were applied to achieve a
false positive rate for peptide identifications of <1%. Spectral
counting was used to estimate the degree of phosphorylation for a particular protein or site. The average was
calculated from replicates and data were normalized for
the spectral counts of GSK3α/β (5). Complete linkage
hierarchical clustering and assembling of heat maps were
carried out with an Euclidian distance matrix on lntransformed data using TIGR's MeV program version
4.1 (8). When comparing MCF-10A and MCF-10A/SrcY527F
cells, phosphorylation sites exhibiting a difference in mean
spectral counts of at least 1.5 in two independent experiments were considered as differentially phosphorylated.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
For phosphorylation assays, cells were treated with PP2
(Calbiochem; 30 μmol/L) or Src kinase inhibitor I (Src-I1;
Calbiochem; 10 μmol/L) for 1 hour. For proliferation assays,
PP2 was used at 10 μmol/L. AG1478 and SU11274 were obtained from Sigma and used at a final concentration of 10
and 1 μmol/L, respectively. PF-562271 was obtained from Symansis and used at 1 to 100 nmol/L. All drugs were dissolved
in DMSO.
Short interfering RNA transfection
Lyn short interfering RNAs (siRNA) “no. 12” and “no. 13”
were obtained from Qiagen (Hs_LYN_12_HP and
Hs_LYN_13_HP validated siRNA). The sequence for Lyn siRNA
“no. 2” was 5′-AAUGGUGGAAAGCAAAGUCCC-3′, for FAK
siRNA “no. 1” and “no. 2” 5′-GCUAGUGACGUAUGGAUGU3′ and 5′-ACACCAAAUUCGAGUACUA-3′, respectively.
ON-TARGETplus Non-Targeting Pool was obtained from

Dharmacon. Cell lines were transfected with 5 to 20 nmol/L
of siRNA using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Forty-eight
hours later, cells were lysed or used for particular assays.
Antibodies and Western blot analysis
The following antibodies were used: v-Src/c-Src (Calbiochem); EphA2 (Millipore); FAK and Hck (BD Transduction
Laboratories); Yes (Transduction Laboratories); β-actin (SigmaAldrich); Erk1/2, Met, Caveolin-1, pY419-Src family, pY705Stat3, pY14-Caveolin-1, pY249-p130Cas, pT184/202/pY186/
204 Erk1/2, pY1148-epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), and pY1173-EGFR (Cell Signaling Technology); Fyn,
EGFR, Stat3, p130Cas, Lyn pY1234-MET, and pY-576 FAK
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and pY397 FAK (Biosource).
Western blotting was undertaken as previously described (7).
Cellular assays
Proliferation was assayed using a MTS assay (Promega).
Soft agar assays were as described previously (9). For apoptosis assays, cells were treated with drugs for 24 hours and the
sub-G1 population was determined by flow cytometry. Significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA across treatments.
Cell tracking and determination of cell invasion through Matrigel (BD BioCoat Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel Invasion
Chamber, BD Biosciences) were undertaken as previously
described (10, 11).
Immunofluorescent staining of mouse
mammary tumors
tp53-null mammary tumors were generated by transplanting epithelium from tp53-null mice (Jackson Laboratory;
FVB/N background; stock no.002899) into the cleared mammary fat pads of recipient wild-type FVB/N mice (12). PyMT
tumors were derived from MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice on
an FVB/N background (13). All animal work was approved by
the Garvan/St. Vincent's Hospital Animal Ethics Committee.
Immunofluorescence analysis of frozen tumor sections was
as previously described (14).
Immunohistochemical staining of breast
cancer specimens
The clinicopathologic characteristics of the cohort and
its subclassification are described elsewhere (15). Ethics
approval for the study was granted by the Human Research
Ethics Committee of St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney (H00 036).
Immunohistochemistry used an anti-Lyn monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-EGFR pY1173
rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology).
Scoring was undertaken by a breast pathology specialist
(S. O'Toole). A histoscore was calculated by multiplying the
percentage of positively stained cells and the category of
staining intensity. For comparison of EGFR pY1173 in different subgroups, three cores from 10 cases of each subgroup
were stained. ANOVA was used to examine differences in
antigen expression between breast cancer subtypes. KaplanMeier survival curves and Cox proportional hazard ratios
were estimated to obtain risks of breast cancer–specific
death. Results were considered significant at the two-sided

used for the analysis.
Reverse phase protein arrays
The study population consisted of 107 patients with primary breast carcinomas treated in the Edinburgh Breast Unit
(Supplementary Table S1). The study was approved by the
Lothian Research Ethics Committee (08/S1101/41). Tumors
were assessed for ER and PR positivity by immunohistochemistry and HER2 positivity by immunohistochemistry and fluo-

rescence in situ hybridization, as previously described (16).
Molecular phenotype was defined as ER+ in tumors with ER
Allred scores ≥3, and triple-negative in tumors with ER Allred
scores <3, PR <3, HER2-negative by immunohistochemistry or
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Tumor samples were homogenized on ice in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5),
5 mmol/L EGTA (pH 8.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl] supplemented
with protease inhibitors (Roche), phosphatase inhibitors
(Sigma) and aprotinin (Sigma). Triton X-100 was added to
1% (v/v) and the lysates clarified by centrifugation. Reverse

Results
Phosphotyrosine profiling of human breast cancer
cell lines
The PhosphoScan approach (5) was applied to a panel of
15 breast cancer cell lines. We identified 544 sites of tyrosine

phosphorylation in peptide sequences derived from 295 nonredundant proteins (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
Thirty-one tyrosine phosphorylation sites were previously
unidentified (Supplementary Table S4).
Upon unsupervised hierarchical clustering using data for
all tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, the cell lines largely
clustered into two groups previously characterized as
“basal” or “luminal” by transcript profiling (Fig. 1A; ref. 11).
Coclustering of lines classified as basal A and basal B (stem
cell–like), respectively, was also evident (11). A distinct
erbB2 subgroup was not resolved, as observed in transcript

profiling studies (11, 18). A subset of the phosphorylation
events associated with basal and luminal cells are highlighted in Fig. 1B. Using data for tyrosine kinases only, the basal
cell lines still clustered together (Fig. 1C). Subgroupings
were also evident. For example, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T
cells formed a basal subgroup characterized by high phosphorylation of UFO (AXL), and MDA-MB-134, -453, and ZR75-1 cells formed a luminal subgroup exhibiting enhanced
phosphorylation of FGFR4.
In addition, proteins and individual phosphorylation sites
were ranked according to the difference in median phosphorylation between the basal and luminal groups (Fig. 2A and B).
Clustering of cell lines using these top-ranked proteins or
sites led to the resolution of basal and luminal clusters that
was not evident when the process was undertaken using randomly selected proteins or sites, validating the ranking process (Fig. 2; data not shown). Increased phosphorylation of
several tyrosine kinases (Met, Lyn/Hck, EphA2, EGFR, and
FAK) was characteristic of basal lines. In addition, we detected enhanced phosphorylation of the predicted pseudo-

www.aacrjournals.org

kinase SgK269, and increased abundance of a peptide
corresponding to the Lyn/Hck activation loop. Western blotting revealed that although Lyn is expressed in all basal lines,
Hck is undetectable (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that
the Lyn/Hck phosphopeptide is derived from Lyn. In contrast, IGF1R/INSR, erbB2, and ACK1 exhibited increased
phosphorylation in luminal breast cancer cells (Fig. 2). For
all of the differentially phosphorylated kinases, increased
phosphorylation was detected on sites that positively regulate kinase activity and downstream signaling. For example,
Met Y1234, Lyn Y397, and FAK Y577 are activation loop sites
(19), and phosphorylation of Y588 and Y594 in the juxtamembrane region of EphA2 is required for kinase activity (20). In
the case of EGFR and erbB2, differential phosphorylation was
predominantly on sites in the COOH-terminal tail that promote activation of the Ras/Erk pathway (21, 22).
A striking characteristic of basal breast cancer cells was
increased tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous SFK substrates intimately involved in the regulation of cell migration. For example, this subgroup exhibited enhanced

phosphorylation of BCAR1 (p130Cas), its binding partner
BCAR3 and other proteins previously linked to SFK signaling including Cav1, tensin-3, and Stat3 (Fig. 2; refs. 23–27).
In the luminal cell lines, non-kinase tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were more diverse in function, and involved in
processes such as endocytic vesicle trafficking and the formation of cell-cell contacts.
Western blotting revealed that for Met, EGFR, Lyn, and
Cav1, total protein expression was higher in the basal subgroup (Fig. 2C). In contrast, FAK, p130Cas, and Erk1/2 were
expressed at similar levels in the two subgroups, but relative
tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced in basal breast cancer cells (Fig. 2D). In the case of Stat3, examples of both mechanisms were evident. These data highlight the ability of
phosphoproteomic profiling to identify signaling network
characteristics dependent on pathway activity, rather than
gene expression.
Expression profile of candidate phosphoproteins in
mouse mammary tumors and human breast cancers
To determine whether the subtype-specific signaling network characteristics of basal breast cancer cell lines in vitro
reflect those of basal-type mammary tumors, we undertook
several approaches. Elevated phosphorylation of EGFR,
Met, and Lyn was characteristic of basal breast cancer
cells (Fig. 2). Consistent with the profiling data, im-

munohistochemical staining of breast cancer specimens revealed that EGFR Y1173 (Y1197 including the signal
peptide) phosphorylation is significantly higher in basal
versus luminal A cancers (Fig. 3A), although phosphorylation was also high in the erbB2/HER2 subgroup. We were
unable to detect Met pY1234/35 by immunohistochemistry
on archival human breast cancer specimens. Instead, we
undertook immunofluorescent staining for Met pY1234/35
on transplanted p53-null mouse mammary tumors, which
exhibit a basal transcriptional signature (28), and MMTVPyMT tumors, which are luminal. Only the former tumors
exhibited positive staining (Supplementary Fig. S2). To
complement these studies, we undertook reverse phase
protein array analysis on an independent breast cancer cohort. This detected significantly higher EGFR Y1173 and
Met Y1234/35 phosphorylation in triple-negative breast
cancers, which are enriched for the basal phenotype, compared with luminal cancers (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation on
these sites was not significantly different between HER2
cancers and the other phenotypes.
We characterized the expression of Lyn over a large breast
cancer patient cohort (15). High Lyn expression (> mean H
score) was strongly associated with the basal subtype (P <
0.0001 by χ2 analysis), but not the other subtypes, including
HER2 (Fig. 3C). High Lyn expression was associated with reduced survival (P = 0.04, hazard ratios = 1.88, Fig. 3D), but it

analysis with the final resolved model incorporating PR expression, HER2 amplification, and lymph node status. These
data confirm that our profiling strategy could identify tyrosine phosphorylation events characteristic of basal, versus luminal, breast cancers.
Characterization of a SFK signaling network in basal
breast cancer cells
A prominent characteristic of basal breast cancer cells
is enhanced phosphorylation of canonical SFK substrates
(Fig. 2). To interrogate the role of SFK signaling in this cell
type, we adopted two strategies. First, we used the immortalized basal mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A (11).
Expression of active Src (Src Y527F) in these cells leads to
a transformed phenotype (7). Phosphoproteomic profiling
was used to compare MCF-10A/SrcY527F cells with vector
controls (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5, Fig. 4A). Comparison of proteins exhibiting enhanced phosphorylation in
MCF-10A/SrcY527F cells and those with increased phosphorylation in basal breast cancer cells (Fig. 2) revealed a strong
overlap. Notably, this overlap was not restricted to key sites
on “downstream” SFK targets such as FAK and p130Cas, but
also extended to the “upstream” receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK) EGFR, EphA2, and Met. Therefore, elevation of SFK
activity is sufficient to enhance site-specific phosphorylation
of these proteins in basal-type cells.
Second, to test whether SFK activity is required to maintain the phosphorylation of these sites in basal breast cancer cells, we used the small molecule SFK inhibitor PP2
(29). Treatment of HCC1954 and BT20 cells with this inhibitor led to a marked decrease in phosphorylation of
FAK and p130Cas, as well as EGFR and Met. Furthermore,
PP2 treatment almost completely abolished Erk activation
(Fig. 4B). Treatment of cells with an unrelated Src inhibitor, Src-I1 (29), also inhibited EGFR, Met, and Erk activation, indicating that the effects of PP2 do not reflect offtarget interactions (Fig. 4C). Overall, these data indicate

www.aacrjournals.org

that SFK activity is a major contributor to the tyrosine
phosphorylation signature characteristic of basal breast
cancer cells (Fig. 5).
Sensitivity of basal breast cancer cell lines to EGFR, Met
and SFK tyrosine kinase inhibitors
The identification of a prominent SFK signaling network
led us to determine the biological effects of inhibiting SFK
activity. Also, because basal breast cancer cells exhibit increased activation of EGFR and Met, we tested the efficacy
of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) directed against these kinases. However, because the degree of activation of these
RTKs in basal breast cancer cell lines varies (Fig. 2), we tested
whether the sensitivity of the cell lines to corresponding TKIs
depends on the target activation profile. In addition, coactivation of several tyrosine kinases in basal breast cancer cells
may promote resistance to individual TKIs. Therefore, we determined whether particular combinations of inhibitors were
more effective than single agents.
Three cell lines were chosen for this analysis: HCC1954
(which exhibits high phosphorylation of both EGFR and
Met), BT20 (EGFR), and BT549 (Met). All three lines exhibit
a phosphorylation signature characteristic of SFK signaling
(Fig. 2). Proliferation of the HCC1954 and BT20 cell lines,
but not BT549 cells, was significantly inhibited by the EGFR
inhibitor AG1478 (Fig. 6A). When used alone, the Met inhibitor SU11274 had no effect on any line (Fig. 6A; data not
shown). The SFK inhibitor PP2 inhibited the proliferation
of HCC1954 and BT20 cells (Fig. 6A), and markedly increased
apoptosis in the former cell line (Fig. 6B). Next, we tested
combinations of TKIs. Coadministration of SU11274 and
AG1478 to HCC1954 cells led to further growth inhibition
compared with AG1478 alone. This effect was not evident
in the other cell lines that do not exhibit high activation of
both EGFR and Met (Fig. 6A; data not shown). Combining
PP2 and SU11274 did not result in enhanced inhibition compared with PP2 alone for any cell line (data not shown). However, coadministration of PP2 and AG1478 to HCC1954 and

BT20 cells led to further inhibition of proliferation compared
with single agent treatments (Fig. 6A). Importantly, combining these drugs also led to increased cell death, particularly in
BT20 cells (Fig. 6B). Throughout these experiments, we noted
that inhibitory effects of particular TKIs on proliferation
of BT549 cells, which exhibit a basal B transcriptional signature (11), were modest (Fig. 6A). However, PP2 markedly

9398

inhibited the random motility of these cells, as indicated
by a significant reduction in cell path length and speed in
cell tracking experiments (Fig. 6C). Consequently, although
some basal breast cancers may be refractory to growth
inhibition by SFK inhibitors, these agents may still be of
clinical benefit by attenuating processes linked to metastatic spread.

Phosphoproteomic Profiling of Breast Cancer

Overall, these data indicate that responses to TKIs in basal
breast cancer cells are not uniform but are dependent on
kinase activation profiles, and that combination-based
approaches may be most effective. Specifically, they show
that EGFR and SFKs represent attractive therapeutic targets,
particularly in combination.

pies directed against these receptors. Consequently, our
study strongly supports therapeutic targeting of SFKs in
basal breast cancer, particularly as a component of combination therapies.
Met, EphA2, EGFR, and FAK also exhibited increased
activation in basal breast cancer cells. Association of the

Characterization of the biological roles of FAK and Lyn
in basal breast cancer cells
Two additional candidates identified by our profiling
were subject to functional analysis: FAK, as it represents
a key “node” of the basal breast cancer signaling network
(Fig. 5); and Lyn, as we had confirmed the association of
this SFK with basal breast cancer using our patient cohort
(Fig. 3). Treatment of BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells with
FAK TKI PF-562271 (30) led to marked inhibition of FAK
phosphorylation on Y397 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). PF562271 did not affect anchorage-dependent proliferation of
these cells, or their invasion through Matrigel (data not
shown). However, this TKI significantly inhibited colony
growth of both cell lines in soft agar (Fig. 7A). In addition,
we determined the effects of reducing FAK protein expression via siRNA-mediated knockdown (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). This led to a significant reduction in anchoragedependent cell proliferation, as well as a marked reduction
in cell invasion (Fig. 7B). These data indicate that under
anchorage-dependent conditions, basal breast cancer cells
are more sensitive to attenuation of FAK expression than
FAK kinase activity, but the latter is important for anchorageindependent growth.
Knockdown of Lyn (Supplementary Fig. S3C) did not significantly affect proliferation of HCC1954, BT-549, or MDAMB-231 cells (data not shown). However, invasion of all three
cell lines through Matrigel was markedly attenuated (Fig. 7C),
indicating that Lyn is required to maintain the invasive
phenotype of these cells. Overall, these data indicate that
both FAK and Lyn may contribute to the aggressive nature
of basal breast cancers.

In this study, we have used a global phosphoproteomic
approach to characterize phosphotyrosine-based signaling
networks in breast cancer cells of contrasting phenotypes,
providing a rich information resource that complements
those describing genomic and transcriptomic alterations
(11, 31). This approach has identified that SFKs govern a
signaling network in basal breast cancer cells that extends
not only downstream to canonical SFK substrates regulating cell adhesion and migration but also upstream to specific RTKs, and that Lyn is a key component of this
network (Fig. 5). Subsequent functional analyses determined that SFKs transmit pro-proliferative, pro-survival
and pro-motogenic signals in these cells, and that Lyn is
an important regulator of cell invasion. In addition, SFKs
promote tyrosine phosphorylation of specific RTKs in these
cells, and this may attenuate cellular sensitivity to thera-

EGFR and Met with this disease subtype has been reported
by other laboratories, lending further support to our approach (14, 32). However, our study highlights two important issues regarding the potential therapeutic targeting of
such “basal-associated” kinases. First, phosphorylation of
kinases such as Met and EGFR among the basal breast
cancer cell lines was not uniform, and the cell lines exhibited differential responsiveness to anti-EGFR and anti-Met
therapies that correlated with the degree of target activation (Fig. 6). Consequently, additional stratification of patients with basal breast cancer based on the expression of
particular drug targets may be required to select the most
appropriate therapy. Second, a striking characteristic of
basal breast cancer cell lines is increased activation of
multiple tyrosine kinases: all of the basal lines exhibited
increased activation of Lyn, together with enhanced phosphorylation of one or more of the RTKs EGFR, Met, and
EphA2 (Fig. 2). Reflecting this, basal breast cancer cells did
not exhibit an obvious “addiction” to tyrosine kinases such
as EGFR and Met, and combined inhibition of two types of
kinase (e.g., the EGFR and SFKs) was more effective in inhibiting proliferation and survival than treatment with single agents. Therefore, basal breast cancers might exhibit a
degree of resistance to individual TKIs, and combination
therapies, or use of multikinase inhibitors, may prove most
effective against this disease subtype. This hypothesis is
supported by work from other laboratories. For example,
effective growth inhibition of glioma cell lines requires
combinatorial use of TKIs due to the presence of multiple
activated RTKs (33).
We have interrogated publicly available data sets to determine whether any of the basal-associated phosphoproteins
exhibit mutational activation or increases in gene copy
number characteristic of “driver” oncogenes. Based on candidate-based studies (34–36), as well as the results of cancer
genome sequencing initiatives (37, 38), somatic mutations in
the “basal-associated” phosphoproteins identified by our
study seem to be rare in breast cancer. In addition, somatic
mutations in the basal-associated tyrosine kinases (Met,
Lyn, EphA2, EGFR, and FAK) have not been detected in
basal breast cancer cell lines (39). However, amplification
of EGFR occurs in the basal breast cancer cell lines BT20
and MDA-MB-468, and the chromosomal region harboring
PTK2 (encoding FAK) is amplified in the basal breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-436 (18). Furthermore, amplification
of EGFR occurs in primary basal breast cancers (40), and
copy number gains in PTK2 correlating with increased expression have been detected in triple-negative breast cancers (41). This suggests that screening for EGFR or PTK2
copy number gains may aid the selection of basal breast
cancer patients for treatment with corresponding targeted therapies. However, it should be noted that even if a
basal-associated kinase does not exhibit mutations or copy
number gains, this does not invalidate it as a potential therapeutic target. For example, Lyn does not exhibit common
genetic aberration, but it is required for efficient basal breast
cancer cell invasion, at least in vitro. Further analysis using appropriate animal models will reveal whether Lyn

can be targeted to prevent the multi-step process of metastatic spread.
Interestingly, whereas knockdown of FAK attenuated both
monolayer proliferation and cellular invasion, FAK TKI
PF-562271 did not affect either of these processes, presumably
because key scaffolding functions are retained by FAK in the
absence of kinase activity (42). However, PF-562271 significantly inhibited anchorage-independent growth of basal breast cancer cells. These data indicate that in the absence of cell-matrix
contacts, the kinase activity of FAK is required to provide proliferative and/or survival signals that promote colony growth.
Because this compound exhibits antitumor efficacy in several
human cancer xenograft models (30), we now plan to test
FAK inhibitors in mouse models of basal breast cancer.
Although most research on Lyn has centered on its role
in hematopoietic cells, this kinase has an emerging role in
solid malignancies including breast cancer, where it has
recently been implicated in the regulation of epithelialmesenchymal transition (36). Interestingly, Lyn is featured
in a gene expression signature characteristic of luminal
progenitor cells, which have been highlighted as candidate
“cells-of-origin” for basal breast cancers (43). These data
indicate that Lyn expression is not specific to malignant
mammary epithelial cells and that this SFK also functions
in normal development of the mammary gland. However,
our finding that expression of this kinase is critical for
the invasive potential of basal breast cancer cells suggests
that its signaling function is “corrupted” in basal breast
cancer cells, possibly due to the increased expression of
RTKs such as EGFR, Met, or EphA2 that occurs in basal
breast cancers. Further functional characterization of Lyn,
and the associated SFK signaling network, in basal breast
cancers cells is likely to yield important biological insights
into the origin, initiation, and progression of basal breast
cancers that can be exploited to improve patient treatment
and management.
