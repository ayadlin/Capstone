p53 as a target in myeloproliferative neoplasms
Min Lu and Ronald Hoffman
The
Philadelphia
chromosome
negative
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) originate at the
level of the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC).
JAK2V617F is present in virtually all patients with
polycythemia vera (PV) as well as 50-60% of patients
with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and essential
thrombocythemia (ET) [1]. Recently, Nakatake and
coworkers demonstrated that JAK2V617F alters p53
responses to DNA damage by upregulating La antigen
that increases MDM2 protein translation [2]. p53 plays a
pivotal role in the maintenance of cell integrity in response
to a variety of stresses by controlling target genes that
regulate cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA
repair, or changes in metabolism. Based on these roles,
p53 has been proposed as a promising molecular target for
the treatment of a variety of cancers. Although about 50 %
of cancers contain mutated forms of p53 which lead to loss
of function, wild type p53 is universally present in PV, by
contrast, p53 mutations have been identified exclusively in
patients undergoing transformation to acute leukemia. The
cellular levels of p53 are controlled by the rate at which
it is degraded. MDM2 is the master regulator of p53, it
regulates p53 levels through a negative feedback loop.
MDM2 not only facilitates p53 degradation, but also binds
p53 and inhibits its transcription. We have recently shown
that MDM2 levels are increased in PV CD34+ cells while
p53 mRNA levels are lower [3]. These observations lead
to the exploration of therapeutic strategies to up-regulate
p53 for the treatment of PV patients. Nutlins are smallmolecule antagonists of MDM2, which specifically bind
to MDM2, blocking MDM2-p53 interactions, resulting
in p53 stabilization, accumulation and activation. This
approach has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in a
non-genotoxic manner in xenograft murine tumor models
[4, 5]. MDM2 antagonists have the potential to be potent
weapons to treat cancers containing wild type p53.
Recently, small-molecule inhibitors of JAK2
inhibitors have been shown to be effective in treating
patients with advanced forms of myelofibrosis resulting
in a reduction in the degree of splenomegaly and
improvement in systemic symptoms but unfortunately the
progeny of the malignant clone has not been documented
to be substantially affected [6]. By contrast, interferon
(IFNα) has been reported to reverse morphological marrow
abnormalities, eliminate cytogenetic abnormalities,
reduce or eliminate cells with JAK2V617F and result
in the re-establishment of polyclonal hematopoiesis in
selected patients with PV, essential thrombocythemia

(ET) and early forms of primary myelofibrosis (PMF)
[7]. We previously determined that IFNα specific targets
PV JAK2V617F positive hematopoietic progenitor cells
(HPC). IFNα activates a p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAP kinase) resulting in apoptosis of PV HPC [8].
IFNα binds to the type I IFN receptor, and activates the
JAK/TYK/STAT pathway, leading to multiple downstream
events. Both the STAT1 and p38 MAPK pathways activate
p53 [9]. Frequently protracted therapy of PV patients with
IFNα is not possible due to a variety of adverse events
necessitating its discontinuation. Since many of these
adverse events are dose dependent, the identification of
drugs which could be combined together with low doses
of IFN would potentially provide a means of treating
greater numbers of PV patients for longer periods of time.
We recently reported that combination treatment
with sub-therapeutic doses of Peg IFNα 2a and Nutlin-3
significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced
apoptosis in PV CD34+ cells as compared to each
agent alone [3]. We also found that the combination of
these agents at low doses decreased the proportion of
JAK2V617F-positive HPCs. Both of these drugs affect
p53 through two distinct pathways with Peg IFNα
2a activating p38 MAP kinase and STAT1 leading to
increased p53 transcription and nutlin-3 prevents the
degradation of p53 [3, 8]. These results strongly suggest
that combinations of low doses of IFNα and nutlin-3 might
serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for the long term
treatment of PV patients.
RG7112 is a novel drug which acts as a selective
inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding and frees p53 from
negative control, activating the p53 pathway in cancer
cells. RG7112 is currently being evaluated in several
clinical trials [10]. We predict that combination treatment
with low doses of RG7112 or other second generation
MDM2 antagonists will provide a promising strategy to
treat a variety of blood cancers including PV.
