Abstract:
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascades are often
activated by genetic alterations in upstream signaling molecules such as
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). Targeting these pathways is often complex
and can result in pathway activation depending on the presence of upstream
mutations (e.g., Raf inhibitors induce Raf activation in cells with wild type
(WT) RAF in the presence of mutant, activated RAS) and rapamycin can induce
Akt activation. Targeting with inhibitors directed at two constituents of the
same pathway or two different signaling pathways may be a more effective
approach. This review will first evaluate potential uses of Raf, MEK, PI3K,
Akt and mTOR inhibitors that have been investigated in pre-clinical and
clinical investigations and then discuss how cancers can become insensitive
to various inhibitors and potential strategies to overcome this resistance.

Recent studies have examined extensive panels
of cell lines for mutations of genes implicated in cancer
as well as for their sensitivity to various inhibitors and
chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used to treat cancers
[1,2]. The cell lines were examined by expression
profiling, chromosome copy number, deep sequencing,
biostatistical and systems analyses. Both studies indicated

[11,12]. Sorafenib is generally well tolerated in HCC
patients with a manageable adverse events profile [11,12].
The effects of sorafenib in combination with other drugs
have been evaluated in HCC [16].
While sorafenib is not considered effective for
the treatment of most melanomas with BRAF V600E
mutations, it may be effective in the treatment of a minority
of melanomas with G469E and D594G mutations which
express constitutive ERK1/2 but low levels of MEK.
These melanomas are sensitive to sorafenib, potentially
because they signal through Raf-1 [18]. MEK inhibitors
have also been examined for treating HCC in mouse
models [13] but they do not appear to be as effective
as Sorafenib, most likely due to the broad specificity of
Sorafenib, which inhibits other targets besides Raf. An
overview of where these inhibitors function is presented
in Figure 1.
PLX-4032 (a.k.a., Zelborab, vemurafenib,
Plexxikon/Roche) is a B-Raf inhibitor that has and is being
evaluated in many clinical trials [19-22]. Vemurafenib has
been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the treatment of patients with unresectable
or metastatic melanoma carrying the BRAF (V600E)
mutation. For vemurafenib to be clinically effective, it
needs to suppress downstream ERK activation essentially
completely [22]. Vemurafenib is in phase II clinical trials
(NCT0128653) for patients with metastatic or unresectable
papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) which have the BRAF
V600E mutation and are also resistant to radioactive
iodine therapy. NCT01524978 is a phase I clinical trial
to evaluate the effects of Vemurafenib on patients with
multiple myeloma and other cancers containing the BRAF
V600E mutation.
PLX-4720 (Plexxikon/Roche) (R7204) is a mutant
B-Raf specific inhibitor that was used for preclinical
studies [23]. Our accompanying manuscript published in
Oncotarget discusses the mutations of various components
of these pathways as well as their biochemical functions
[24]. PLX-4720 was designed using a unique screening
platform developed by Plexxikon that involved the use of
structural and medicinal chemistry techniques [25]. This
more selective screening approach has resulted in a series
of B-Raf inhibitors based on the structural implications
of BRAF mutation and which discriminate between the
mutant and WT protein. PLX-4720 is orally available and
is highly selective for the mutant B-Raf protein. PLX-4720
is effective against melanomas, as well as colorectal cancer
(CRC) and other cancers, with the BRAF V600E mutation.
BRAF V600E has been associated with more aggressive
tumors and lower rates of patient survival [25].  The IC50
value for PLX-4720 is approximately 3-fold lower in in
vitro kinase assays with mutant versus WT B-Raf proteins
and demonstrates an approximately 60-fold lower IC50
value in vivo when cell lines with mutant and WT BRAF
genes are compared [25]. The IC50 value for PLX-4720
was compared with sorafenib in a panel of melanomas,

that sensitivity to inhibitors was often associated with
genetic mutations at key elements in the Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and some other
pathways. One study has generated a “Cancer Cell
Line Encyclopedia” which will be useful for predictive
modeling of inhibitor sensitivity [1]. Sensitivity to MEK
and Raf inhibitors was often investigated in these studies.
Sensitivity to the B-Raf inhibitor PLX4720 was shown to
be highly associated with particular mutations at BRAF
(V600E). Sensitivity to MEK inhibitors was shown to be
associated with BRAF, NRAS as well as PTEN, PTPN5,
SPRY2, DUSP4, DUSP6 mutations and to a lesser extent
mutations at KRAS. Sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in
NRAS mutant lines was associated with aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AHR) expression [2].

Overview of Pathway Inhibitors
Effective inhibitors specific for many of the key
components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/
PTEN/mTOR pathways have been developed [3-11].
In many cases, these inhibitors have been examined in
clinical trials. Furthermore, inhibitors that target the
mutant protein more than the wild type (WT) protein
of various genes (e.g., BRAF and PIK3CA) either have
been or are being characterized. Thus specific inhibitors
have been made and some are currently used in the
clinic. Targeting some components of these pathways has
proven clinically effective. In some of the diseases, there
are a very large number of patients with few effective
treatments [(e.g., Sorafenib and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC)] [11-13].

Raf/MEK Inhibitors
Raf inhibitors have been developed and some
are being used for therapy while others are being
evaluated in clinical trials. Raf inhibitors have in general
exhibited greater response rates in clinical trails than
MEK inhibitors which may be related to the broader
therapeutic index of Raf inhibitors that suppress ERK
activity in a mutant-allele specific fashion as opposed to
MEK inhibitors which suppress MEK activity in tumor
and normal cells [14]. Some inhibitors (i.e, Sorafenib,
Bayer) were initially thought to specifically inhibit Raf
but have been subsequently shown to have multiple
targets (e.g., VEGF-R, Flt-3, c-Kit, PDGF-R) [15-17].
However, that does not preclude their usefulness in
cancer therapy. Sorafenib is approved for the treatment
of certain cancers (e.g., renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and
patients with unresectable HCC). Sorafenib was evaluated
in the Sorafenib Hepatocellular carcinoma Assessment
Randomized Protocol (SHARP) trial, which demonstrated
that the drug was effective in prolonging median survival
and time-to-progression in patients with advanced HCC

Figure 1: Overview of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK Cascade and Small Molecule Inhibitors Used for Targeting this Pathway.

Activation of this pathway can occur by mutations in upstream growth factor receptors (GFR) or by stimulation by the appropriate growth
factors (GF). In addition, mutations can occur in intrinsic members of the pathway (RAS RAF, MEK1 or the tumor suppressor Neurofibromin
(NF1). GFR and GR are indicated in blue. Kinases are indicated in green ovals. Coupling molecules are indicated by orange ovals. The Ras
molecule is indicated by a purple oval. Transcription factors are indicated by yellow diamonds. Sites where NF1, protein phosphatase 2A

Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. NF1, PP2A and RKIP are depicted in black rectangles as they normally serve to dampen the activity of this
pathway. Molecules such as Mcl-1 which are anti-apoptotic and phosphorylated by ERK and Akt are indicated by blue ovals, other antiapoptotic molecule are also indicated by blue ovals. Pro-apoptotic molecules are indicated by black ovals. Red arrows indicate activating

CRC and non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The BRAF
gene status was known in all of these cell lines. The IC50
value for PXL-4720 was approximately 100-fold lower
(range: 17.5 to 280 nM) than sorafenib in melanomas and
colon carcinomas that had the BRAF V600E mutation;
however, the IC50 value for PLX-4720 was approximately
the same as sorafenib in colon carcinomas and NSCLC
without BRAF mutations, but with RAS mutations. PLX4720 arrests mutant but not WT BRAF melanoma cells at
the G0/G1 cell-cycle stage and initiates apoptosis in these
cells.
Studies examining the effects of sorafenib on
sorafenib-resistant cell lines transfected with BRAF genes
containing gatekeeper mutations indicated that the mutant
B-Raf signaling was resistant to sorafenib, but sorafenib
still inhibited tumor growth driven by the mutant B-Raf
protein. In essence sorafenib was inhibiting Raf-1 activity
which was induced by the mutant B-Raf protein. In
contrast, PLX-4720 inhibited tumor growth by targeting
oncogenic B-Raf. These studies indicated that sorafenib
suppressed tumor growth independently of B-Raf while
PLX-4720 directly inhibited the oncogenic effects of
B-Raf [26].
GSK2118436 (a.k.a. dabrafenib) is an ATPcompetitive inhibitor of mutant B-Raf, WT B-Raf and
WT Raf-1 developed by GlaxoSmithKlein (GSK) in
clinic trial (NCT00880321), which examined patients with
melanoma, brain metastases, in other solid tumours it was
determined to be safe and elicited responses. It was an
active inhibitor of BRAF V600E in this trial [27].
CCT239065 is a mutant B-Raf inhibitor developed
at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, UK [28].
It inhibits BRAF mutant allele (V600E) signaling and
proliferation more than WT BRAF-mediated signaling.
Its effects are more selective for cells containing mutant
BRAF than WT BRAF. CCT239065 is well tolerated in
mice and had good oral bioavailability. It suppressed
tumors containing BRAF mutant genes but not WT BRAF
tumors in mice tumor xenograft studies [28].
GDC-0879 is a BRAF mutant allele selective
inhibitor developed by Genentech which has been
evaluated in pre-clinical studies [29]. The efficacy GDC0879 is related to the BRAF V600E mutational status in
the cancer cells and inhibition of downstream MEK and
ERK activity.
PLX5568 is a selective Raf kinase inhibitor
developed by Plexicon. It is being examined for the
treatment of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). In the
kidney, Raf-1 is localized to the tubular cells where it
is linked to many physiologically important functions.
PLX5568 suppressed cyst enlargement in a rat model of
PKD but did not improve kidney function as fibrosis was
not suppressed [30].
Raf-265 is an ATP-competitive pan-Raf inhibitor
developed by Novartis. Treatment of bronchus carcinoid
NCI-H727 and insulinoma cells (CM insulinoma cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

line) with Raf-265 enhanced sensitivity to TRAILinduced apoptosis. These cells are normally resistant to
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors when combined with TRAIL.
Raf-265 was shown to decrease Bcl-2 levels which
correlated with their sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis. This approach may be effective in the therapy
of neuroendocrine tumors [31]. Raf-265 is being evaluated
in a clinical trial (NCT00304525) for treatment of patients
with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma.
Regorafenib (BAY 73-4506) is an oral multikinase
inhibitor of angiogenic, stromal and oncogenic RTKs
developed by Bayer. Regorafenib inhibits RTKs such as
VEGF-R2, VEGF-R1/3, PDGF-Rβ, fibroblast growth
factor receptor-1 as well as mutant Kit, RET and B-Raf.
The effects of regorafenib on tumor growth have been
evaluated in human xenograft models in mice, and tumor
shrinkages were observed in breast MDA-MB-231 and
renal 786-O carcinoma models [32].
AZ628 is a selective Raf inhibitor developed by
Astra Zenica. BRAF-mutant melanoma cells are normally
very sensitive to AZ628. However, when AZ628 cells
are grown for prolonged periods of time, they become
resistant to AZ628 by upregulating the expression of Raf1 [33].
XL281 is an orally-active WT and mutant RAF
kinases selective inhibitor developed by Exelixis and
Bristol-Myers Squibb. It has been examined in clinical
trials primarily with patients having BRAF mutations
(CRC, melanoma, PTC and NSCLC) [34].

Results of Clinical Trials with Sorafenib.
Some of first clinical trials with Raf inhibitors
were with sorafenib (NexavarTM) in metastatic RCC [35].
Clinical trials with melanoma were also done around the
same time period [36]. The clinical trials with melanoma
patients and sorafenib as a single agent did not yield
encouraging results. Due to the broad specificity of
sorafenib this drug has been evaluated for the therapy of
diverse cancers, including RCC, melanoma and HCC (due
to the involvement of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, as well
as altered VEGFR pathway in these cancers) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) (due to the involvement
of KIT mutations in this cancer). Sorafenib has been
approved for the treatment of renal cancer, including
RCC in 2005 and for HCC in 2007. Although BRAF is not
mutated in RCC, VEGFR-2 may be aberrantly expressed
as there is dysregulation of its cognate ligand VEGF which
can activate VEGFR2 and the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade.
Sorafenib is active as a single agent in RCC, probably due
to its ability to suppress the activities of essential growthrequired signaling pathways.
Phase II and larger phase III clinical trails with
sorafenib combined with chemotherapy or targeted
therapy were performed. NCT00461851 was a phase II
trial with bladder cancer patients. It combined sorafenib

with gemcitabine and carboplatin. NCT01371981 was a
phase II/III with sorafenib and the proteosomal inhibitor
bortezomib as well as various chemotherapeutic drugs
including asparaginease, cytarabine, daunorubicin and
mitoxantrone in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and yielded variable results with low response
rates [38].

As the BRAF gene is mutated in approximately 50 to
70% of melanomas, sorafenib was evaluated for its ability
to suppress melanoma growth in mouse models [39]. Most
BRAF mutations occur at V600E. Sorafenib had only
modest activity as a single agent in advanced melanoma

and it did not appear to be more effective in the treatment
of melanomas that are either WT or mutant at the BRAF
gene, hence it may be targeting a kinase other than B-Raf
in these melanomas (e.g., VEGFR or Raf-1). Alternatively,
it could be targeting an upstream receptor kinase which
signals through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. It is
relevant to examine the effects of combining sorafenib
with a MEK inhibitor to treat malignant melanoma and
certain other cancers. Sorafenib may target the VEGFR
and other membrane receptors expressed on the particular
cancer cells, whereas the MEK inhibitor would specifically
suppress the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade which is abnormally
activated by the BRAF oncogene or other mutant upstream
signaling molecules. To improve the effectiveness of
sorafenib in the therapy of melanoma, it is being combined
with standard chemotherapeutic drugs.

Ras. The Raf inhibitors can induce B-Raf binding to Raf-1.
Vemurafenib can, to a lesser extent, induce B-Raf binding
to Raf-1 when the ERK-mediated negative feedback loop
on B-Raf was inhibited with a MEK inhibitor. These
binding events were determined to require the presence of
activated Ras (WT or mutant), which may be necessary for
the translocation from the cytoplasm to the membrane and
assembly into the signaling complex. This has therapeutic
implications, as after treatment of patients with mutant
RAS with certain B-Raf inhibitors, B-Raf can bind and
activate Raf-1 and promote the oncogenic pathway. In
fact, even kinase-dead BRAF mutations, which have been
observed in human cancer [47], the mutant B-Raf proteins
can dimerize with Raf-1, when stimulated by the mutant
Ras protein and activate the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. For
Raf-selective inhibitors to be therapeutically useful, prior
screening of patients for RAS mutations will be necessary,
as well as perhaps additional screening during treatment.
Otherwise resistance may develop and lead to further
stimulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade.
ATP-competitive Raf inhibitors inhibit ERK
signaling in cells with mutant BRAF, but enhance
signaling in cells with WT BRAF. Drug-mediated
transactivation of Raf dimers was shown to be responsible
for the activation of the enzyme by inhibitors. The Raf
inhibitors bind to the ATP-binding site of the Raf dimer.
The inhibitors can also bind to B-Raf:Raf-1 heterodimers.
Raf activity is dependent on Ras activity. The Raf inhibitor
binding to one Raf protomer results in the inhibition of
that protomer, but activation of the remaining protomer.
RAS is not normally mutated in cells with BRAF mutants
and there is minimal Ras activity. Hence in BRAFmutant cells, Raf inhibitors will be effective in inhibiting
downstream MEK:ERK signaling. However in cells with
active Ras, they will not [44,45]. These basic science
observations have been essentially confirmed in clinical
trials [19,20,22].
Raf activation occurs after treatment of certain
cancer patients with Raf inhibitors. This abnormal
Raf activation can lead to skin diseases such as
keratoacanthomas (KAs) and cutaneous squamous cell
carcinomas (cSCCs) in patients with RAS mutations.
These results indicate that co-targeting with Raf and MEK
inhibitors may be appropriate in patients who have active
Raf and B-Raf [48,49].

Results of Clinical Trials with Vemurafenib.
Phase I, II and III clinical trials with vemurafenib
have been performed. A greater than 90% reduction in
active ERK was necessary for clinical response [22]. In
the phase III clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with
the standard of care chemotherapeutic drug decarbazine,
the trial was terminated prematurely as it was apparent
that vemurafenib was more effective than decarbazine
[40]. Vemurafenib was approved for the treatment of
unresectable metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma in
2011. Recently, the results of a phase II clinical trial
(NCT00949702) indicated that vemurafenib induces
clinical responses in greater than 50% of previously
treated mutant BRAF (V600E or V600K) melanoma
patients the median overall survival was approximately
16 months [41].

Results of Clinical Trials with Dabrafenib
(GSK2118436).
Dabrafenib has also displayed positive results in
Phase I/II trials [42,43]. Dabrafenib is in ongoing Phase II
clinical trials (NCT01153763) as a single agent in patients
with BRAF mutant melanoma.

Need for Genetic Screening Before Treatment
with Raf Kinase Inhibitors.

Resistance to Raf Inhibitors.

It is critical to determine the genetic status at both
BRAF and RAS before treatment with Raf inhibitors
[44-46]. Class I B-Raf inhibitors (active conformation
inhibitors) such as (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) will
inhibit BRAF mutants, however these ATP-competitive
B-Raf inhibitors will not inhibit WT B-Raf in the presence
of activated Ras expression. In fact, these B-Raf inhibitors
can activate Raf-1 in these cells in the presence of active
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A problem with treatment of melanoma patients
with mutant BRAF is the emergence of inhibitor-resistance
which occurs frequently and relatively rapidly after
treatment with the Raf inhibitors (2-18 months) [50].
This may be due to the persistence of melanoma cancer
initiating cells (CICs) [51-54]. Some of these CICs may
have other mutations besides BRAF.
There are many different mechanisms by which

Activation of this pathway can occur by mutations in upstream growth factor receptors (GFR) or by stimulation by the appropriate GF. In
addition mutations can occur in intrinsic members of the pathway (RAS PIK3CA, AKT or the tumor suppressors (NF1, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2).

melanoma cells can become resistant to Raf inhibitors
[55]. Unlike resistance mechanisms observed in some
other cancers such as imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) where the resistant cells often have
mutations in the gatekeeper residues in BCRABL which
allows the cells to proliferate and activate additional
signaling pathways in the presence of imatinib, others
mechanism for Raf inhibitor-resistance are more frequently
observed in cells containing BRAF mutants. Gatekeeper
mutations in BRAF can be created experimentally, and
the cells are resistant to the B-Raf specific inhibitors, but
these mutations do not appear to occur frequently in B-Raf
inhibitor-resistant clinical specimens [50,59,60].
Poulikakos and colleagues demonstrated a novel
resistance mechanism which involves a splice variant
in the mutated BRAF allele that leads to a loss of the
Ras binding domain in the B-Raf protein that prevents
dimerization. This mutant form of BRAF V600E elicits
enhanced dimerization in cells which contain low levels
of active Ras, in comparison to cells containing the fulllength BRAF V600E mutation. The truncated B-Raf
V600E kinase can dimerize with Raf-1 and induce
downstream MEK/ERK in the absence of activating Ras
mutations and the cells are resistant to the Raf inhibitors
[61]. This splicing mutation was determined to be present
in BRAF V600E in six of nineteen vemurafenib-treated
patient samples which had undergone relapse.
Many different types of gene deregulation events
have been observed in B-Raf inhibitor-resistant cells
[62,63]. Mutations at cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)
and amplification of cyclin-D1 have been documented in
clinical specimens from B-Raf inhibitor-treated patients
which underwent remission [64]. A diagram illustrating
some of the mechanisms by which cells become resistant
to Raf and MEK inhibitors is presented in Figure 2.
Amplification of the B-Raf gene has been reported
in some B-Raf inhibitor-resistant cells [65]. The B-Raf
gene was determined to be amplified in a subset of some
treatment-naïve cells. The authors of this study determined
that treatment with B-Raf and MEK inhibitors eliminated
resistance of the cells. An additional study observed that
the mutant BRAF V600E gene was amplified in 4 out
of 20 melanoma patients which were resistant to B-Raf
inhibitors [66]. This mechanism of B-Raf inhibitorresistance is distinct from resistance generated by NRAS
mutations or overexpression as the cells with amplified
BRAF V600E were independent of Raf-1 expression while
N-Ras-mediated inhibitor resistance was dependent on
Raf-1 expression.
In an attempt to identify genes which could
potentially confer resistance to B-Raf inhibitors, one
group expressed a panel of approximately 600 kinaserelated open reading frames in normally B-Raf inhibitorsensitive A375 melanoma cells, which contain the BRAF
V600E mutation [67]. This group identified mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase kinase 8 (MAP3K8)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which encodes the serine-threonine protein kinase COT/
Tp12 (cancer Osaka thyroid oncogene/ tumor progression
locus-2) as a MAPK pathway agonist which drives
resistance to Raf inhibition in BRAF mutant cell lines.
COT was demonstrated to induce ERK via MEK but
independent of Raf [67]. COT expression was observed to
inversely correlate with BRAF V600E expression which
may suggest that B-Raf may downregulate COT protein
levels by destabilizing the protein. When BRAF V600E
expression decrease due to B-Raf inhibitor treatment, the
levels of COT are predicted to rise. Combining B-Raf
and MEK inhibitors would overcome the resistance to
the B-Raf inhibitors in the cells which overexpressed
COT. The genomic region surrounding MAP3K8 (COT)
was amplified in 2 out of 38 BRAF-mutant cell lines.
These lines had not previously been treated with B-Raf
inhibitors. The lines with amplified MAP3K8 (COT) were
demonstrated to be resistant to B-Raf inhibitors. COT
expression was determined to be increased in expression in
some relapse patients. COT inhibitors are being developed
and may be effective in overcoming the resistance present
in some B-Raf inhibitor-resistant tumors [68].
The DNA sequences of 138 cancer genes from tumor
cells isolated from a patient that initially was sensitive to
the vemurafenib which became resistant after treatment
were examined [50]. This study observed that there was a
mutation in MEK1 (C121S) in the vemurafenib-resistant
tumor which was not present in the original tumor. The
MEK1 C121S mutation conferred resistance to both Raf
and MEK inhibitors.
In another study with B-Raf inhibitor-resistant
patient samples, the resistant cells were observed
to have mutations at NRAS or overexpress PDGFRbeta [60]. These authors indicated that resistance to
B-Raf inhibitors was not due to secondary mutations at
BRAF, but activation of additional signaling pathways
by PDGFR-beta or by N-Ras activation of the Raf/
MEK/ERK pathway. PDGFR-beta was observed to be
hyperphosphorylated in the cells from one B-Raf inhibitorresistant line, but surprisingly the cells were not sensitive
to imatinib which can target PDGFR-beta.
Other studies have indicated that switching of
Raf isoforms may confer resistance to B-Raf inhibitors.
Switching from B-Raf to either Raf-1 or A-Raf was
observed after incubation of melanoma cells containing
the BRAF V600E mutation in the presence of the B-Raf
inhibitor dabrafenib for prolonged periods of time in
the recovered inhibitor-resistant cells. In these inhibitorresistant cells, they expressed other isoforms of Raf
(e.g., Raf-1 or A-Raf) (69). In this study some inhibitorresistant cells were also observed to overexpress IGF-1R
which can also induce the expression of the PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR pathway. Combined treatment with IGF-1R/
PI3K and MEK inhibitors eliminated the resistance of the
cells. Increased expression of IGF-1R and activation of
Akt was also demonstrated in one of five paired specimens

obtained from post-relapse vemurafenib-treated patients as
compared to the patient samples prior to treatment.
Suppression of pro-apoptotic Bim expression
is a mechanism of resistance to B-Raf inhibitors [70].
PTEN-mutant cells display decreased levels of Bim.
Often melanoma cells with BRAF mutations also contain
PTEN or PIK3CA mutations. Vemurafenib increases Bim
expression in PTEN WT cells. The involvement of Akt-3
and FOXO3a was reported in these studies. Combining
B-Raf and PI3K inhibitors enhanced Bim expression via
FOXO3a in the PTEN-mutant cells.
In a study of Raf265-resistant melanomas containing
the BRAF V600E mutation, it was observed that protein
kinase D3 (PRKD3) mediated resistance to both Raf
and MEK inhibitors and siRNA knockdown of PRKD3
cooperated with Raf265 in suppressing the growth of the
resistant melanoma cells [71]. CID755673 is a PRKD3
inhibitor [72]. Potentially CID755673 could be combined
with B-Raf inhibitors to suppress the growth of certain
B-Raf inhibitor-resistant melanomas.
Dabrafenib-resistant A375 melanoma cells were
isolated by culturing the cells in dabrafenib. The resistant

cells were also resistant to vemurafenib and the MEK
inhibitor trametinib (GSK112012, an allosteric MEK
inhibitor), in frame deletions of MEK1 and mutations at
NRAS mutations were observed in some cells. The in frame
deletions of MEK occurred at MEK1 K59del, the NRAS
mutations occurred at NRAS Q61K and A146T in the
presence and absence of the MEK1 P387S mutation in the
A375 BRAF V600E line and NRAS Q61K in the YUSIT1
BRAF V600K line. The combination of dabrafenib
and trametinib suppressed cell growth in the resistant
lines. These results are somewhat surprising as some
of the resistant lines had NRAS mutations. N-Ras could
potentially activate PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway
which could promote resistance to these inhibitors. The
combination of the PI3K inhibitor GSK2126458 and either
B-Raf or MEK inhibitors enhanced growth suppression
and decreased ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation [27].
Combination clinical trials are planned based on these
results.
Two recent studies have indicated that the tumor
microenviroment may contribute to the resistance to
B-Raf and other small molecule inhibitors. The tumor

microenviroment can secrete growth factors such
as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) which results in
activation of the HGF receptor MET and subsequent
downstream Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
signaling which results in resistance to the small molecule
inhibitors [73,74].

are relatively unique to these kinases and may explain
the high specificity of MEK inhibitors. This binding may
lock MEK1/2 in an inactivate conformation that enables
binding of ATP and substrate, but prevents the molecular
interactions required for catalysis and access to the ERK
activation loop. In basic research studies, treatment with
the MEK inhibitor resulted in the detection of activated
MEK1/2 when the western blot is probed with an antibody
that recognizes active (phosphorylated) MEK1/2, while
downstream ERK1/2 did not appear activated with the
activation specific ERK1/2 antibody [13,79]. Selumetinib
inhibited downstream ERK1/ERK2 activation in in vitro
cell line assays with stimulated and unstimulated cells,
and also inhibited activation in tumor-transplant models.
Selumetinib did not prevent the activation of the related
ERK5 that occurs with some older MEK1 inhibitors,
which are not being pursued in clinical trials. Inhibition
of ERK1/2 suppresses their ability to phosphorylate and
modulate the activity of Raf-1, B-Raf and MEK1 but not
MEK2 as MEK2 lacks the ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation
site. In essence, by inhibiting ERK1/2 the negative loop of
Raf-1 and MEK phosphorylation is suppressed and hence
there will be an accumulation of activated Raf-1 and MEK
[13,79]. This biochemical feedback loop may provide a
rationale for combining Raf and MEK inhibitors in certain
therapeutic situations.
In colon, melanoma, pancreatic, liver and some
breast cancers, selumetinib inhibited the growth of tumors
in tumor xenograft studies performed in mice. The new
MEK inhibitors are also at least 10 to 100-fold more
effective than earlier MEK inhibitors and hence can be
used at lower concentrations [13,79]. Selumetinib also
inhibits the growth of human leukemia cells, but does not
affect the growth of normal human cells. Selumetinib also
suppressed the growth of pancreatic BxPC3 cells, which
do not have a known mutation in this pathway, suggesting
that this drug may also be useful for treating cancers
that lack definable mutations. However, it is likely that
BxPC3 cells have some type of upstream gene mutation/
amplification or autocrine growth factor loop that results
in activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.
Selumetinib induced G1/S cell-cycle arrest in colon
and melanoma cancer cell lines and activated caspase-3
and -7 in some cell lines (Malme3M and SKMEL2);
however, caspase induction was not observed in other
melanoma (SKMEL28) or colon cancer cell lines (HT29),
demonstrating that further research needs to be performed
with this inhibitor to determine if it normally induces
apoptosis and whether the induction of apoptosis can be
increased with other inhibitors or chemotherapeutic drugs.
Selumetinib suppressed the tumor growth of
pancreatic cells, such as BxPC3, in immunocompromised
mice more effectively than conventional chemotherapeutic
drugs, such as gemcitabine, which is commonly used to
treat pancreatic cancer; however, once treatment with
selumetinib was discontinued, the tumors reappeared

MEK Inhibitors
Specific inhibitors of MEK have been developed:
PD98059, PD184352 (a.k.a. CI-1040), PD0325901 (all
Pfizer), U0126 (DuPont), Selumetinib (a.k.a., ARRY142886, AZD6244) (Astra-Zeneca), MEK162/ARRY162 (Novartis), GDC-0973 (Genentech), RDEA119/
Refametinib (Ardea Biosciences/Bayer), GSK112012
(GlaxoSmithKlein), TAK-733 (Takeda San Diego,
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc), RO4987655 (Roche)
and AS703026 (EMD Serono) [3-5,13,75-85].
MEK inhibitors differ from most other kinase
inhibitors as they do not compete with ATP binding
(non-ATP competitive), which confers a high specificity
[75]. Most MEK inhibitors are specific and do not inhibit
many different protein kinases [75-79] although as will
be discussed below, certain MEK inhibitors are more
specific than others. The crystal structures of MEK1 and
MEK2 have been solved as ternary complexes with ATP
and PD184352, and have revealed that both MEK1 and
MEK2 have unique inhibitor binding sites located on a
hydrophobic pocket adjacent to, but not overlapping with,
the ATP-binding site [75]. Furthermore, effective targeting
of MEK1/MEK2 is highly specific, as ERK1/ERK2 are
the only well-described downstream targets. A distinct
advantage of inhibiting MEK is that it can be targeted
without knowledge of the precise genetic mutation that
results in its aberrant activation. This is not true with
targeting Raf as certain Raf inhibitors will activate Raf and
also certain B-Raf-specific inhibitors will not be effective
in the presence of RAS mutations as discussed above.
An advantage of targeting MEK is that the Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is a convergence point where
a number of upstream signaling pathways can be
blocked with the inhibition of MEK. For example, MEK
inhibitors, such as selumetinib (AZD6244), are also being
investigated for the treatment of pancreatic cancers,
breast cancers, and other cancers such as hematopoietic
malignancies, including multiple myeloma [75].
ClinicalTrials.gov lists 49 clinical trials for Selumetinib,
either as a single agent or combined with another inhibitor
or combinined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Selumetinib inhibits MEK1 in vitro with an IC50
value of 14.1 ± 0.79 nM [79]; it is specific for MEK1
as it did not appear to inhibit any of the approximately
40 other kinases in the panel tested. Selumetinib is not
competitive with ATP. Molecular modeling studies
indicate that selumetinib binds to an allosteric binding
site on MEK1/MEK2. The binding sites on MEK1/MEK2

[13,79]. Most likely MEK inhibitors do not induce
apoptosis, but rather, they inhibit proliferation. That is,
MEK inhibitors are cytostatic.
PD-184352 (Pfizer) was the first MEK inhibitor
to enter clinical trials and it demonstrated inhibition of
activated ERK and anti-tumor activity in patients [75];
however, subsequent multicenter, phase II studies with
patients with diverse solid tumors did not demonstrate
encouraging results [75]. This was probably due to low
oral bioavailability and high metabolism, which led to
plasma drug levels that were inadequate to suppress tumor
growth.
The subsequent PD-0325901 MEK inhibitor is
an orally-active, potent, specific, non-ATP competitive
inhibitor of MEK. PD-0325901 demonstrated improved
pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties compared
with PD-184352, including a greater potency for inhibition
of MEK, and higher bioavailability and increased
metabolic stability. PD-0325901 has a Ki value of 1 nM
against MEK1 and MEK2 in in vitro kinase assays. PD0325901 inhibits the growth of cell lines that proliferate
in response to elevated signaling of the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathways [75]. Clinical trials with PD-0325901 have
documented some successes and some adverse side effects
[75]. MEK inhibitors may be appropriate to treat only

those cancers that proliferate in response to activation of
the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway [75]. Furthermore, it may also
be important to include an additional pathway inhibitor,
chemotherapeutic drug or radiation treatment to induce
death of the cancer cell. There is a phase I clinical trial
(NCT01347866) examining the effects of combining PD0329501 with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502.
Initially this phase I trial will examine toxicity in patients
with advanced cancers. If tolerable toxicity levels are
observed, then additional studies will be perfomed with
CRC patients containing mutant KRAS genes who have
had previous therapy.
RDEA119/Refametinib is a more recently described
MEK inhibitor developed by Ardea Biosciences [8385]. It is a highly selective MEK inhibitor that displays
a >100-fold selectivity in kinase inhibition in a panel of
205 kinases. In contrast, in the same kinase specificity
analysis, other recently developed MEK inhibitors (e.g.,
PD0325901) also inhibited the Src and RON kinases [8385].
Trametinib (GSK1120212) is an allosteric MEK
inhibitor developed by GSK. It has been shown to be
effective when combined with dabrafenib in certain
dabrafenib-resistant BRAF V600 melanoma lines that also
had mutations at NRAS or MEK1 [86]. The combination

of trametinib and the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor
GSK2126458 also enhanced cell growth inhibition in
these B-Raf inhibitor-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma
lines.
GDC-0973 (XL518) is a potent and selective MEK
inhibitor developed by Genentech [78,87]. The effects of
combining GDC-0973 and the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941
on the proliferation of BRAF and KRAS mutant cancer
cells indicated combination efficacy both in vitro and in
vivo.
AS703026 (MSC1936369B) is a MEK inhibitor
developed by EMD Serono. AS703026 suppressed
cetuximab-resistant CRCs which had KRAS mutations
both in vitro and in vivo models [88]. AS703026 inhibited
growth and survival of multiple myeloma (MM) cells
and cytokine-induced differentiation more potently
than selumetinib and importantly AS703026 was
cytotoxic, where as most MEK inhibitors are cytostatic
[89]. AS703026 sensitized MM cells to a variety of
conventional (dexamethasone, melphalan), and novel
(lenalidomide, perifosine, bortezomib, rapamycin) drugs
used to treat MM.
RO4987655 (CH4987655) is an allosteric, orally
available MEK inhibitor developed by Roche/Chiron. It
has been tested in humans and determined to inhibit active
ERK levels. At the levels of RO4987655 administered, it
was determined to be safe in healthy volunteers [90].
TAK-733 is a potent and selective, allosteric MEK
inhibitor developed by Takeda San Diego [91]. TAK-733
is being investigated in clinical trials. MEK162 (ARRY162) is a MEK inhibitor developed by Novartis. SL337 is
a MEK inhibitor that has been used in many neurological
and drug addiction studies [92].

Phase I will evaluate the effects of AS703026 on patients
advanced hemtopoietic malignancies. Phase II is a
continuation of the trial with AS703026 for elderly AML
patients who are not good candidates for chemotherapy.
The effects of MEK inhibitors on on patients with other
cancers are also being examined in clinical trials.
Selumetinib is an orally-active MEK1 inhibitor that
has undergone phase II clinical trials. It is one of the first
MEK1 inhibitors to be evaluated in randomized phase II
trials [75,93]. Selumetinib has demonstrated significant
tumor suppressive activity in preclinical models of cancer,
including melanoma, pancreatic, colon, lung, liver and
breast cancer. The effects of selumetinib are enhanced
significantly if the tumor has a mutation that activates the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Selumetinib shows
great promise in the treatment of pancreatic cancers, which
often have mutations in Ras that can lead to downstream
Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation. Due to the frequent
detection of pancreatic cancer at advanced stages, it may
be necessary to combine signal transduction inhibitor
therapy with conventional chemotherapy after surgical
removal of the pancreatic cancer if possible. There is a
clinical trial (NCT01222689) combining selumetinib
and erlotinib (an EGFR inhibitor) in pancreatic cancer
patients who have failed gemcitabine therapy. There are
approximately 49 clinical trials with selumetinib listed on
the Clinical.Trials.gov website.
There are approximately 84 clinical trials with MEK
inhibitors listed on the Clinical.Trials.gov webite. There
are 15 trials with MEK inhibitors and lung cancer, 14 trials
with MEK inhibitors and pancreatic cancer, 10 trials with
MEK inhibitors and colon cancers, 4 trials with MEK
inhibitors and leukemias, 4 trials with MEK inhibitors
and HCC, 4 trials with MEK inhibitors and brain cancers,
2 trials with MEK inhibitors and breast cancer and
interestingly 0 trials with MEK inhibitors and prostate
cancer. Initial results from clinical trials have not yielded
overwhelming support for the use of MEK inhibitors as
a single therapeutic agent in cancer patients who are not
pre-screened for pre-existing activation of the Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK pathway [75,76,93]. Indeed, there are 21
clinical trials listed on the Clinical.Trials.gov website with
MEK inhibitors and melanoma patients which often have
mutation of BRAF and hence activation of downstream
MEK. The proper pre-identification of cancer patients who
display activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may be
necessary for prescribing MEK inhibitors as part of their
therapy, as we have stated previously that MEK inhibitors
are cytostatic and not cytotoxic.
HCC is the 5th most common cancer world-wide
and there are few current effective therapies [11,80-83].
It is the 3rd most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide and unfortunately it is the first in terms of cancer
deaths in improvished countries. Targeting activated
signaling and metabolic pathways have been considered as
alternative approaches to treat HCC and improve therapy

MEK Inhibitors in Clinical Trials
There are approximately 84 clinical trials with
MEK inhibitors listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Clinical trials have been and are being performed with
various cancer patients and selumetinib (AZD6244),
PD0325901, CI-1040, GSK1120212, TAK-733,
RO4987655, MEK162, AS703026 and RHEA119. The
MEK inhibitors may be appropriate for the treatment of
certain melanomas which have mutant BRAF [62,93].
Phase II and III clinical trials have also been performed
with the allosteric MEK inhibitor GSK1120212
(trametinib). GSK1120212 is in at least 27 clinical trials.
NCT01037127 is a phase II clinical trial to examine
the effectiveness of GSK112012 in melanoma patients
containing a mutant BRAF gene. The trial will examine the
effects of GSK112012 in either treatment-naïve or B-Raf
inhibitor-treated patients. ARRY-438162 (MEK162) is a
MEK inhibitor is currently in clinical trials in patients with
advanced cancer. NCT0017925 is a phase I clinical trial
with RDEA119 (BAY 86-9766) for patients with advanced
cancers. NCT00957580 is a clinical trial with AS703026.

and outcomes [94-99].
Human HCC tumors have higher expression and
enhanced activity of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 compared
with adjacent non-neoplastic liver [80]. Over-expression
of activated MEK1 in HCC HepG2 cells resulted in
enhanced tumor growth in vivo [81]. Preclinical studies
have demonstrated the potential of MEK inhibition to
suppress hepatoma cell proliferation and tumorigenicity
[13]. Huynh et al. reported that treatment of human HCC
xenografts with selumetinib blocked ERK1/2 activation,
reduced in vivo tumor growth, and induced apoptosis
[13]. Moreover, targeting MEK with PD-0325901 had in
vivo chemopreventive effects on HCC development in an
animal model employing TGF-alpha-transgenic mice in
which liver cancers were induced by diethylnitrosamine
treatment [82]. Therefore, MEK represents a potential
therapeutic target for HCC.

besides the regulation of Akt (e.g., protein phosphatase
activity). Furthermore these studies demonstrated that the
combination of MEK and PI3K pathway inhibitors could
be an effective approach to treat certain cancers that had
activation of both pathways.
Breast cancer affects nearly 1 in 7 women and is
a diverse disease for which there is not one specific
treatment which can be used to treat all patients. In
addition, breast cancer patients often develop resistance to
certain treatments such as hormonal, chemo-, radiotherapy
perhaps due to the presence of CICs. Many genes have
been implicated in breast cancer and sensitivity to therapy
(e.g., HER2, EGFR, ER, PIK3CA, BRCA, PTEN, TP53
and others) [104-108]. In addition, other genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated including
deregulated expression of many other types of genes
including tumor suppressors [109-120], cell cycle
regulatory molecules [121], and more recently miRNA
have been implicated in breast cancer [122-125]. In
addition various physiological and genetic events may
be altered or provoked in breast cancer and contribute
to tumor progression and metastasis including: EMT
[126], survival and expansion of CICs [127-130] genomic
instability [131,132], epigenetic modifications [133,134],
changes in the tumor microenvironment and stroma [135143], angiogenesis [144], and senescence [145,146].
Thus there are many different genetic, biochemical and
physiological processes which involved in breast cancer
progression and scientists and clinicians have attempted
to target various events. As we have stated previously,
MEK is a common site of interaction of various signaling
pathways, thus the ability to inhibit breast cancer by MEK
inhibitors has been investigated.
Breast cancer can be classified into three types:
luminal breast cancers which are usually ER+ and
have a relatively good prognosis and response rate to
hormonal based therapies, HER2+ cancers which have
a poor prognosis if untreated but are initially responsive
to herceptin, and basal-like breast cancers which have a
poor prognosis and lack expression of HER2, estrogen and
progesterone receptors (referred to as “triple-negative”).
Only certain types of breast cancer are sensitive
to MEK inhibitors [102,103]. Many basal breast cancers
express high levels of EGFR which results in activation
of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Hoeflich and
colleagues [103] found that basal cell breast cancers
expressed a Ras-like expression profile and tested their
hypothesis that these breast cancers could be sensitive
to MEK inhibitors, providing that they do not have
PI3KCA mutations or PTEN deletions. In contrast, many
luminal and HER2-amplified tumors are resistant to MEK
inhibitors. They also determined that PTEN loss was a
negative predictor factor for response to MEK inhibitors.
Furthermore, treatment with MEK inhibitors often led
to an increase in activated Akt expression, providing the
rationale to examine the consequences of co-addition of

Dual Raf-MEK Inhibitors
Recently a dual B-Raf/Raf-1 and MEK inhibitor
has been described [100]. RO5126766 is a first-in-class
dual Raf/MEK inhibitor which allosterically inhibits
B-Raf, Raf-1 and MEK. RO5126766 has a different
mode of action than other Raf inhibitors as binds MEK
and suppresses the phosphorylation of MEK by Raf via
the formation of a stable Raf:MEK complex. RO5126766
selectively inhibited Raf and MEK and not any of the
other 256 kinases in the Ambit KINOME panel. It was
also show to be effective in suppressing the growth of
certain human tumors with various combinations of
mutated and WT KRAS/HRAS and BRAF. This inhibitor
has been evaluated in a Phase I clinical trail [100]. Three
partial responses were observed in fifty-two patients. Two
BRAF-mutant melanoma patients responded and one
NRAS- mutant melanoma patient responded. In contrast,
to treatment with certain B-Raf inhibitors there were no
cases of keratoacanthomas observed which the authors
postulated was due to co-inhibitor of Raf and MEK. Dual
Raf/MEK inhibitors may suppress the development of
inhibitor resistance.

MEK Inhibitor Resistance
Some tumors are resistant to MEK inhibitors
because they contain EGFR, KRAS, PI3KCA or PTEN
mutations [101-103]. Some cells with EGFR or KRAS
mutations are resistant to MEK inhibitors as these
mutant oncoproteins can also activate the Ras/PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway. These studies, which were performed in
vitro with cells lines and in vivo using xenografts, also
demonstrated that PI3K activation and PTEN inactivation
were not always equivalent in terms of inhibitor sensitivity.
The authors suggested that a possible reason for this
phenomenon could be that PTEN has other functions

MEK and PI3K inhibitors. The authors also determined
that co-administration of MEK and PI3K inhibitors
enhanced killing of the certain breast cancers. Thus the
investigations by Wee et al, and Hoeflich et al., have
demonstrated the concept that elevated PI3K/Akt/mTOR
expression will confer resistance to MEK inhibitors.
These studies illuminate the critical role of genetics in
determining the sensitivity to targeted therapy.
Other studies have also indicated that some tumors
with EGFR mutations are resistant to MEK inhibitors.
Mutations at the BRAF, KRAS, EGFR genes or the
chromosomal fusion between anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) and ROS (oncogene that belongs to the sevenless
subfamily of tyrosine kinase insulin receptor genes,
originally detect in the v-ros retrovirus) tyrosine kinases
are detected in approximately 50% of NSCLC. NSCLC
cells with BRAF mutations where shown to be more
sensitive to MEK inhibitors than NSCLC with mutations
in EGFR, KRAS, or the chimeric fusion between ALK
and ROS [101]. This was determined by screening a
large panel of cell lines (n=87) and tumors (n=916). In
this study, cells with mutations at EGFR were resistant to
MEK inhibitors. This may have resulted from the ability
of EGFR to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway
which as discussed below has some crucial overlapping
targets with the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. NSCLC patients
with EGFR mutations should not be treated with MEK
(or BRAF) inhibitors as the respective therapies would be
ineffectual.
In some MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells
which contained either the G469E or D594G mutant
BRAF alleles, activation of Raf-1 by the mutant B-Raf
proteins was observed to confer resistance to MEK
inhibitors [18]. The G469E and D594G BRAF mutants are
considered weak B-Raf mutations and signal through Raf1. In these cells, survival is mediated by the G469E- and
D594G-mutant B-Raf proteins stimulating Raf-1 which
becomes mitochondrial localized and regulates apoptosis
though phosphorylation of Bad and enhancement of the
anti-apoptotic properties of Bcl-2. Sorafenib induced a
reduction of Bad phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in
the D594G/G469E melanoma cells. The effects of Raf-1
on the prevention of apoptosis were demonstrated in the
D594G/G469E but not BRAF V600E mutant melanoma
cells by shRNA knock down of Raf-1. These studies
indicate that sorafenib may be appropriate in the treatment
of a minority of melanomas which survive in response
to Raf-1 activation and are essentially MEK inhibitorresistant.
Amplification of a mutant BRAF gene in
selumetinib-resistant CRCs was observed in cells which
were selected for selumetinib-resistance in vitro [65].
The sensitivity of the cells to the MEK inhibitor could be
restored by treatment with low doses of a B-Raf inhibitor.
In this study, the authors demonstrated that the amplified
mutant BRAF gene was present in a small minority of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment-naïve cells. In another study by a different group
of investigators, resistance to selumetinib was observed
in CRC lines harboring mutations in BRAF (COLO205
and HT29) or KRAS (HCT116, LoVo). The selumetinibresistant lines did not appear to have mutations in either
MEK1 or MEK2 but had upregulation of B-Raf or K-Ras
respectively due to intrachromosomal amplification of
their respective driving oncogenes, BRAF V600E or KRAS
G13D which the authors demonstrated was responsible for
their selumetinib-resistance [147,148].
Mutations in the allosteric binding pocket of the
MEK1 gene were observed in a different study which
isolated MEK-inhibitor resistant cells from MDAMB-231 basal breast cancer cells [149]. Basal breast
cancer cells are often sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. The
MDA-MB-231 cell line has mutations at BRAF G464V
and KRAS G13D. The MEK inhibitor-resistance could be
overcome by treatment with ERK inhibitors, even in the
resistant cell line with KRAS amplification.
Additional MEK-inhibitor resistant lines were
derived from HCT-116 and LoVo CRC cell lines [149].
The MEK inhibitor-resistant HCT-116 cell line also had
mutations in the allosteric binding pocket mutations in
MEK1 while the MEK inhibitor-resistant LoVo cells had
mutations in the allosteric binding pocket in MEK2. One
MEK inhibitor-resistant HCT-116 cell line also had the
allosteric binding pocket mutation as well as amplification
of KRAS but remained sensitive to growth inhibition upon
treatment with the ATP-competitive ERK inhibitor, ERKi
(name of inhibitor provided by authors in manuscript).
These studies also demonstrated the effectiveness of
inhibiting ERK in overcoming resistance to MEK
inhibitors even if BRAF or KRAS is amplified or mutated.
Furthermore the combination of MEK and ERK inhibitors
may be beneficial in treating certain inhibitor-resistant
cells.

Combining Raf and MEK Inhibitors
The possibility of treating certain patients with a
Raf and a MEK inhibitors is a concept which is gaining
more acceptance as it may be a therapeutic possibility
to overcome resistance [14]. Raf inhibitors induce Raf
activity in cells with WT RAF if Ras is active, however,
the addition of a MEK inhibitor would suppress the
activation of MEK and ERK in the normal cells of the
cancer patient. Thus B-Raf would be suppressed by the
B-Raf-selective inhibitor in the cancer patient while the
consequences of Raf activation in the normal cells would
be suppressed by the MEK inhibitor. These concepts are
being examined in clinical trials (NCT01072175 and
NCT01231594). NCT01072175 is a clinical trial with

examining the effects these MEK and Raf inhibitors
on adult patients with solid tumors with either RAS or
BRAF V600E mutations. The MEK inhibitor RDEA119/
refametinib and sorafenib have been combined in Phase
I/II clinical trials (NCT00785226) with patients having
various types of advanced cancer. The dual Raf/MEK
inhibitor RO5126766 has been in Phase I clinical trials
[100].
The effects of combining MEK and Bcl-2/Bcl-XL
inhibitors have been examined in pre-clincial studies with
AML cell lines and patient samples [150]. The Bcl-2/
Bcl-XL inhibitor ABT-737 was observed to induce ERK
activation and Mcl-1 expression. However, when the
ABT-737 inhibitor was combined with the MEK inhibitor
PD0325901, a synergistic response was observed in terms
of the induction of cell death both in AML cell lines and
primary tumor cells with the properties of leukemia stem
cells (a.k.a. CICs). Furthermore these studies were also
extended into tumor transplant models with the MOLT-13
cell line and synergy between ABT-737 and PD0325901
were also observed in vivo.

evaluated [158-161]. These include: rapamycin (WyethPfizer, sirolimus) and modified rapamycins (rapalogs)
(CCI-779, torisel, temsirolimus, Wyeth-Pfizer), AP-23573
(ridaforolimus, Ariad-Merck) and RAD001 (afinitor,
everolimus, Novartis). Rapamycin and the modified
rapalogs are mTORC1 inhibitors. A diagram illustrating
the sites of action of various inhibitors is presented in
Figure 3.

PI3K Inhibitors
Two well-known and isoform-nonselective PI3K
inhibitors are the fungal metabolite wortmannin and
LY294002. These drugs block the enzymatic activity
of PI3K by different mechanisms. Wortmannin is an
irreversible inhibitor (IC50≈2 nM) which forms a covalent
bond with a conserved lysine residue involved in the
phosphate-binding reaction [162], while LY294002 is a
classical reversible, ATP-competitive PI3K modulator
(IC50=1.40 μM) [163].
In spite of the crossover inhibition of other
lipid and protein kinases (for example, LY294002
also inhibits mTOR, casein kinase 2 (CK2), DNAdependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and others) [164],
and their unfavorable pharmaceutical properties, both
wortmannin and LY294002 have served as important
research tools for more than a decade in elucidating the
role of PI3K in the biology of human cancer [165-170].
The modified wortmannin, PX-866 is a PI3K inhibitor
[171,172]. It has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials.
PX-866 is currently being evaluated in approximately
five clinical trials for prostate cancer, melanoma, CRC,
NSCLC, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,
glioblastoma and other advanced cancers.
GDC-0941 is a PI3K inhibitor developed
by Genentech. GDC-0941 inhibited the metastatic
characteristics of thyroid carcinomas by targeting both
PI3K and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1-alpha)
pathways [173]. GDC-0941 synergized with the MEK
inhibitor UO126 in inhibiting the growth of NSCLC
[174]. It is being evaluated in a clinical trial for advanced
cancers or metastatic breast cancers which are resistant to
aromatase inhibitor therapy (NCT01437566).
IC87114 is a selective p110-delta PI3K inhibitor. It
decreased cell proliferation and survival in AML cells, and
increased sensitivity to etoposide [175-179]. It has been
in clinical trials to treat AML patients (NCT00004263
and NCT00301938). CAL-101(GS-1101) is a derivative
of IC-87114 [180-184]. It is an oral p110-delta PI3K
inhibitor developed by Calistoga Pharmaceuticals and
Gilead Sciences. CAL-101 is currently undergoing
clinical evaluation in patients with various hematopoietic
malignancies including: relapsed or refractory indolent
B-cell NHL, mantle cell lymphoma or CLL. An additional
clinical trial, will examine the effects of combining
CAL-101 with chemotherapeutic drugs and the αCD20

ERK Inhibitors
There are at least two ERK molecules regulated by
the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, ERK1 and ERK2. Little is
known about the differential in vivo targets of ERK1 and
ERK2. The development of specific ERK1 and ERK2
inhibitors is ongoing and may be useful in the treatment
of certain diseases such as those leukemias where elevated
ERK activation is associated with a poor prognosis (e.g.,
AML, ALL) [151]. ERK inhibitors have been described
[152]. AEZS-131 has been reported on the internet to be a
highly selective ERK 1/2 inhibitor developed by AEterna
Zentaris. Other ERK inhibitors (ERKi) have also been
developed and evaluated for their use in overcoming MEK
inhibitor resistance [149].

Inhibitors
Pathway

Targeting

the

PI3K/Akt/mTOR

Numerous PI3K inhibitors have been developed
and evaluated [3,4,6-10]. These include: LY-294002
(Lilly), Wortmannin, PX-866 (Oncothyreon), GDC-0941
(Genentech), CAL-101 (Calistoga Pharmaceuticals),
XL-147 and XL-765 (Exelixis and Sanofi-Aventis).
Some PDK1 inhibitors have been described but they
are not specific for PDK1 including OSU-03012
(Arno Therapeutics) and Celecoxib (Pfizer). Various
Akt inhibitors have been developed [153-157]. These
include: A-443654 (Abbott Laboratories), GSK690693
(GlaxoSmithKline), VQD-002 (a.k.a. API-2, VioQuest
Pharmaceuticals), KP372-1 (QLT, Inc), perifosine
(AEterna Zentaris/Keryx Biopharmaceuticals) and MK2206 (Merck). Inhibitors of downstream mTOR have been

monoclonal Ab (MoAb). The clinical trial (NCT01088048)
will examine the effects of combining CAL-101 with
chemotherapeutic drugs and the αCD20 monoclonal Ab.
CAL-101 has displayed significant cytotoxic activity in
23% of B-ALL samples tested, but only in 3% of AML
samples. CAL-101 treatment resulted in dephosphorylated
Akt-1 at T308 and induced apoptosis in neoplastic B-cells
[181]. Remarkably, CAL-101 did not significantly affect
the survival of healthy B-, T-, and natural killer (NK)
lymphocytes [182]. However, it was found that CAL101 inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines,
such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-alpha (produced by T-lymphocytes), and interferon
(IFN)-gamma (synthesized by NK lymphocytes). It
remains to be established whether decreased production
of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma will impair inflammatory
responses in B-ALL patients treated with CAL-101.
XL-147 (SAR245408) is a PI3K inhibitor developed
by Exelixis/Sanofi-Aventis [183]. 2010). It is in at least 11
clinical trials, either as a single agent or in combination
with erlotinib, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or MoAb
therapy for various cancers including: lymphoma, breast,
endometrial, glioblastoma, astrocytoma or other solid
cancers.
NVP-BKM120 (BKM120) is an orally available
pan-class I PI3K inhibitor developed by Novartis
[184,185]. It is in clinical trials, either as a single agent
or in combination with other drugs or signal transduction
inhibitors [185]. NVP-BKM120 is in at least 36 clinical
trials with patients having advanced cancers such as CRC,
NSCLC, breast, prostate, endometrial, squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck, GIST, RCC, melanoma
and advanced leukemias.
NVP-BYL719 (BYL719) is a PI3K-alpha selective
inhibitor developed by Novartis. It is in clinical trials for
patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT01387321)
some containing mutations at PIK3CA (NCT01219699).
It is also being examined in a clinical trial in combination
with the MEK-162 inhibitor for patients with advanced
CRC, esophageal, pancreatic, NSCLC or other advanced
solid tumors containing RAS or BRAF mutations
(NCT01449058). Some have questioned whether
inhibitors which target just PI3K will be effective in cancer
therapy as single agents due to in part the complicated
feed-back loops which result in the activation of certain
receptor molecules [186].

PI3K inhibitors or allosteric mTOR inhibitors, such as
rapamycin or rapalogs. In contrast to rapamycin/rapalogs,
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors targeted both mTOR complex
1 and mTOR complex 2, and inhibited the rapamycinresistant phosphorylation of eIF4B-1 and inhibited
protein translation of many gene products associated with
oncogenesis (enhanced proliferation) in leukemic cells.
The dual inhibitors strongly reduced the proliferation rate
and induced an important apoptotic response [7].
The kinase selectivity profile of the dual PI3K/
mTOR modulators is consistent with the high sequence
homology and identity in the ATP-catalytic cleft of these
kinases. Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors have demonstrated
significant, concentration-dependent cell proliferation
inhibition and induction of apoptosis in a broad panel
of tumor cell lines, including those harboring PIK3CA
activating mutations [187].
Moreover, the in vitro activity of these ATPcompetitive PI3K/mTOR modulators has translated well in
in vivo models of human cancer xenografted in mice. They
were well tolerated and achieved disease stasis or even
tumor regression when administered orally [188]. In spite
of their high lipophilicity and limited water solubility, the
pharmacological, biological and preclinical safety profiles
of these dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors supported their
clinical development [189].
There may be some benefits to treating patients
with an inhibitor that can target both PI3K and mTOR
as opposed to treating patients with two inhibitors, i.e.,
one targeting PI3K and another specifically mTOR. An
obvious benefit could be lowered toxicities. Treatment
with a single drug could have fewer side effects than
treatment with two separate drugs. The effects of
detrimental Akt activation by mTOR inhibition might
be avoided upon treatment with a dual kinase inhibitor.
Furthermore, the negative side effects of mTOR inhibition
on the activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway might
be eliminated with the PI3K inhibitor activity in the
dual inhibitor. There remains, however, considerable
uncertainty about potential toxicity of compounds that
inhibit both PI3K and mTOR enzymes whose activities
are fundamental to a broad range of physiological
processes. Although it should be pointed out that there are
some clinical trials in progress to determine whether it is
beneficial to treat cancer patients with a PI3K/mTOR dual
inhibitor and an mTORC1 blocker such as NVP-BEZ235
and RAD001. Pre-clinical studies have documented the
benefits of combining RAD001 with NVP-BEZ235 [190].
PI-103 was the first reported ATP-competitive kinase
inhibitor of mTOR which also blocked the enzymatic
activity of PI3K p110 isoforms. It was developed at UCSF
in 2006. PI-103 exhibits good selectivity over the rest of
the human kinome in terms of non-selective inhibition
of other kinases [191,192]. PI-103 is a pan-class I PI3K
inhibitor with IC50 values in the 2 nM (p110-alpha PI3K)
to 15 nM range (p110-gamma PI3K) PI-103 inhibits both

Dual PI3K/mTOR Inhibitors
The catalytic sites of PI3K and mTOR share a high
degree of sequence homology. This feature has allowed the
synthesis of ATP-competitive compounds that target the
catalytic site of both PI3K and mTOR. Several dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors have been developed. In preclinical
settings, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors displayed a much
stronger cytotoxicity against leukemic cells than either

mTORC1 (IC50=0.02 microM) and mTORC2 (IC50=0.083
microM).
NVP-BEZ235 is a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
developed by Novartis. Importantly and in contrast to
rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235 inhibited the rapamycinresistant phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, causing a marked
inhibition of protein translation in AML cells. This
resulted in reduced levels of the expression of c-Myc,
cyclin D1, and Bcl-xL known to be regulated at the
translation initiation level [193]. NVP-BEZ235 suppressed
proliferation and induced an important apoptotic
response in AML cells without affecting healthy CD34+
cell survival. Importantly, it suppressed the clonogenic
activity of leukemic, but not healthy, CD34+ cells [194].
NVP-BEZ235 targeted the side population (SP) of
both T-ALL cell lines and patient lymphoblasts, which
might correspond to CICs, and synergized with several
chemotherapeutic agents (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine,
dexamethasone) currently used for treating T-ALL patients
[195]. Also, NVP-BEZ235 reduced chemoresistance
to vincristine induced in Jurkat cells by co-culturing
with MS-5 stromal cells, which mimic the bone marrow
microenvironment [196]. In this study, NVP-BEZ235
was cytotoxic to T-ALL patient lymphoblasts displaying
pathway activation, where the drug dephosphorylated 4EBP1, in contrast to the results obtained with rapamycin.
Taken together, these findings indicated that longitudinal
inhibition at two nodes of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR network
with NVP-BEZ235, either alone or in combination with
chemotherapeutic drugs, may be an effective therapy for
of those T-ALLs that have aberrant upregulation of this
signaling pathway.
NVP-BEZ235 has been evaluated also in a mouse
model consisting of BA/F3 cells overexpressing either
WT BCR-ABL or its imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants
(E255K and T315I) [197]. NVP-BEZ235 inhibited
proliferation of both cytokine-independent WT BCR-ABL
and mutant BCR-ABL (E255K and T315I) overexpressing
cells, whereas parental cytokine-dependent Ba/F3 cells
were much less sensitive. The drug also induced apoptosis,
and inhibited both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling.
Remarkably the drug displayed cytotoxic activity in vivo
against leukemic cells expressing the E255K and T315I
BCRABL mutant forms However, in this experimental
model, NVP-BEZ235 induced an over activation of
MEK/ERK signaling, most likely due to the well-known
compensatory feedback mechanism that involves p70S6K
[198]. NVP-BEZ235 has been intensively investigated
and is in at least eight clinical trials for patients with
advanced cancers [199]. NCT01343498, NCT01195376
and NCT01513356 are clinical trials of NVP-BEZ235
as a single agent in patients with advanced solid tumors
including breast. In the clinical trial NCT00620594, NVPBEZ235 is being evaluated in breast cancer patients,
some of whom may also be treated with herceptin.
NCT01285466 is a clinical trial for patients with advanced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

solid cancers who will be treated with NVP-BEZ235,
paclitaxel and herceptin. NVP-BTG226 is a recently
developed PI3K/mTOR inhibitor by Novartis.
PKI-587 is a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor developed by
Pfizer [201,202]. It is also known as PF-05212384 and it
inhibits class I PI3Ks, PI3K-alpha mutants, and mTOR.
PKI-587 suppressed proliferation of approximately 50
diverse human tumor cell lines with IC50 values less than
100 nmol/L. PKI-587 induced apoptosis in cell lines with
elevated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. PKI-587 inhibited
the tumor growth in various models including: breast
(MDA-MB-361, BT474), colon (HCT116), lung (H1975),
and glioma (U87MG). The efficacy of PKI-587 efficacy
was enhanced when administered in combination with the
MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, the topoisomerase I inhibitor,
irinotecan, or the HER2 inhibitor, neratinib.
PF-04691502 is an ATP competitive PI3K/Akt
inhibitor developed by Pfizer which suppresses activation
of Akt [202]. PF-04691502 suppressed transformation of
avian cells in response to either WT or mutant PIK3CA.
PF-04691502 inhibited tumor growth in various xenograft
models including U87 (PTEN null), SKOV3 (PIK3CA
mutant), and gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor) and erlotinibresistant NSCLC [202]. Both PKI-587 and PF-04691502
are in clinical trials with patients having endometrial
cancers (NCT01420081).
PKI-402 is a selective, reversible, ATP-competitive,
PI3K and mTOR inhibitor developed by Pfizer. It
suppresses mutant PI3K-alpha and mTOR equally. PKI402 inhibited the growth of many human tumor cell lines
including: breast, glioma, pancreatic, and NSCLC [203].
XL765 (SAR25409) is a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
developed by Exelixis/Sanofi-Aventis. XL765 has been
investigated in brain and pancreatic cancer models either
as a single agent or in combination with temozolomide
[204] or the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine [205].
XL765, downregulated the phosphorylation of Akt induced
by PI3K/mTORC2 and reduced brain tumor growth
[204]. Combining XL765 with chloroquine suppressed
autophagy and induced apoptotic cell death in pancreatic
tumor models [205]. XL-147 (SAR245408) and XL-765
(SAR245409) are in at least 13 clinical trials, either as a
single agent or in combination with erlotinib, hormonal
therapy, chemotherapy, or MoAb therapy for various
cancers including: lymphoma, breast, endometrial or other
solid cancers. NCT01240460 is a clinical trial for recurrent
glioblastoma and astrocytoma grade IV patients who are
candidates for surgical resection by Exelixis and SanofiAventis. XL765 (Exelixis/Sanofi-Aventis) [204] has been
in clinical trials either as single agent (NCT00485719) to
treat patients with advanced tumors. In one study XL765,
downregulated the phosphorylation of Akt induced by
PI3K/mTORC2 and reduced tumor growth. XL765 also
resulted in clinical benefit in 5 out of 19 patients [188].
Other clinical trials are being performed with XL765 in
combination with temozolomide to treat patients with

glioblastoma (NCT00704080) or in combination with
erlotinib to treat NSCLC patients (NCT00777699).
GNE-477 is a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor developed
by Genentech. GDC-0980 is similar to GNE-477 and has
high activity in cancer models driven by PI3K pathway
activation [206]. GDC-0980 is in a clinical trial for
patients with advanced cancers or metastatic breast
cancers which are resistant to aromatase inhibitor therapy
(NCT01437566).
GSK2126458 is a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
developed by GSK [80]. It is in at least two clinical
trials with advanced cancer patients. In one trial it is
being combined with the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212.
GSK1059615 is a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor developed
by GSK. It was in a clinical trial with patients with solid
tumors, metastatic breast cancer, endometrial cancers and
lymphomas which was terminated.
WJD008 (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai)
is a dual PI3K/mTOR [207]. WJD008 inhibited the
increased activity of the PI3K pathway normally induced
by PIK3CA H1047R and suppressed proliferation and
colony formation of transformed RK3E cells containing
PIK3CA H1047R.

Many attempts to develop Akt inhibitors have been
performed over the years. In many of the earlier attempts,
the various Akt inhibitors either lacked specificity or
had deleterious side effects. Part of their deleterious side
effects of many “Akt” inhibitors are probably related to
the numerous critical functions that Akt plays in normal
physiology. Namely some Akt inhibitors will alter the
downstream effects of insulin on Glut-4 translocation and
glucose transport.
Triciribine (API-2) is an Akt inhibitor that has
been used in many studies; at least 92 are listed on
the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Triciribine suppressed
phosphorylation of all three Akt isoforms in vitro and
the growth of tumor cells overexpressing Akt in mouse
xenograft models [213]. The mechanism(s) by which
triciribine inhibits Akt activity are not clear. The drug
has been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in patients
with advanced hematologic malignancies, including
refractory/relapsed AML. In this trial (NCT00642031),
triciribine was administered on a weekly schedule. The
drug was well-tolerated, with preliminary evidence of
pharmacodynamic activity as measured by decreased
levels of activated Akt in primary blast cells [214]. 
Triciribine has also been examined in a clinical trial
(NCT00363454) with Akt+ metastatic cancers.
MK-2206 (Merck) is an allosteric Akt inhibitor
which inhibits both T308 and S473 phosphorylation. It
also inhibits the downstream effects of insulin on Glut4 translocation and glucose transport [215]. MK-2206
decreased T-acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cell
viability by the blocking the cells in the G0/G1 phase of
the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. MK-2206 also
induced autophagy in the T-ALL cells. MK-2206 induced
a concentration-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt and
its downstream targets, GSK-3-alpha/beta and FOXO3A.
MK-2206 also was cytotoxic to primary T-ALL cells and
induced apoptosis in a T-ALL patient cell subset (CD34+/
CD4-/CD7-) which is enriched in CICs. [216]. MK-2206
is in at least 43 clinical trials either as a single agent or
in combination with other small molecule inhibitors or
chemotherapeutic drugs with diverse types of cancer
patients.
GSK690693 is a pan Akt inhibitor developed
by GSK. GSK690693 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor
effective at the low-nanomolar range. Daily administration
of GSK690693 resulted in significant antitumor activity
in mice bearing various human tumor models including
SKOV-3 ovarian, LNCaP prostate, and BT474 and HCC1954 breast carcinoma. The authors also noted that
GSK690693 resulted in acute and transient increases in
blood glucose level [217]. The effects of GSK690693
were also examined in 112 cell lines representing different
hematologic neoplasia. Over 50% of the cell lines were
sensitive to the Akt inhibitor with an EC50 of less than

Resistance to PI3K/mTOR Inhibitors
Recently resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors has
been observed. In one case, c-Myc and eIF4E amplification
were observed which result in elevated 5’cap-dependent
protein translation in human mammary epithelial cells that
were resistant to NVP-BEZ235 [208]. In another study, the
authors observed NOTCH pathway, including downstream
c-Myc activation which eliminated the dependency of the
cells on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [209]. NOTCH is
frequently activated in T-ALL [6-10]. This may explain
the resistance of some ALLs to PI3K inhibitors. c-Myc
is frequently amplified in certain cancers [3-6]. This may
contribute to the inherent resistance of this type of tumor
to PI3K inhibitors [209]. A diagram illustrating potential
mechanisms of resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors is
presented in Figure 4.

PDK Inhibitors
Some compounds have been reported to be PDK
inhibitors, including the modified celecoxib, OSU03012 [210, 211] and 2-O-BN-InsP(5) [212]. Celecoxib
(Celebrex, Pfizer) obviously has other targets than PDK,
such as cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). Celecoxib is used to
treat CRC patients to reduce the number of polyps in the
colon. OSU-03012 is reported not to inhibit Cox-2 [210].
2-O-BN-InsP(5) is based on the structure of based on the
structure of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate, it may
inhibit both PDK and mTOR [212].

did not inhibit the proliferation of normal human CD4+
peripheral T lymphocytes as well as mouse thymocytes.
GSK2141795 is an Akt inhibitor under development
at GSK. It is reported by GSK to be an oral, pan Akt
inhibitor which shows activity in various cancer models,
including blood cancers and solid tumor models. In
addition it is reported by GSK to delay tumor growth
in solid tumor mouse xenograft models. It has been
investigated further in clinical trials.
KP372-1 (QLT, Vancouver, Canada) inhibits PDK1,
Akt and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt-3) signaling
and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in
AML cells but not normal hematopoietic progenitor cells
[218]. It also suppressed colony formation of primary
AML patient sample cells but not normal hematopoietic
progenitor cells. It has also been investigated in other
cancer types, including squamous cell carcinomas of the
head and neck, thyroid cancers and glioblastomas.
Enzasturin (LY317615) is a protein kinase C-beta
(PKC-beta) and Akt inhibitor developed by Lilly. It has
been investigated in clinical trials either by itself or in
combination with other agents in various types of cancer
patients including: brain [219] and NSCLC [220], CRC
[221] as well as other cancer types. It is reported to be in
approximately 48 clinical trials on the ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Perifosine
(KRX-0401,
Keryx
/
AOI
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and licensed to AEterna Zentaris) is
an alkylphospholipid that can inhibit Akt [222]. The effects
of perifosine have been examined on many different tumor
types. Perifosine induces caspase-dependent apoptosis and
downregulates P-glycoprotein expression in multidrugresistant T-ALL cells by a JNK-dependent mechanism
[223]. Perifosine is or has been in at least 43 clinical trials
to treat various cancer patients, with either blood cancers
or solid tumors, either by itself, or in combination with
other agents. It has advanced to phase III clinical trials for
CRC and MM. In the USA it has orphan drug status for the
treatment of MM and neuroblastoma.
Erucylphosphocholine
(ErPC)
and
erucylphosphohomocholine (ErPC3) have been shown
to inhibit Akt and induce apoptosis in malignant glioma
cell lines which are normally resistant to the induction
of apoptosis. They are structurally related to perifosine
[224]. ErPC enhanced radiation-induced cell death and
clonogenicity [225]. These effects on the induction of
apoptosis were correlated with increased Bim levels and
decreased Bad and Foxo-3 phosphorylation, potentially
consequences of decreased Akt activity. ErPC3 is the first
intravenously applicable alkylphosphocholine. ErPC3 was
cytotoxic to AML cells through JNK2- and PP2-dependent
mechanisms [226].

inhibitors and do not directly affect the mTOR catalytic
site [6,7]. They associate with the FK506 binding protein
12 (FKBP-12) and by so doing, they induce disassembly of
mTORC1, resulting in repression of its activity [231,232].
The rapalogs have been examined in clinical trials with
patients having various cancers including: brain, breast,
HCC, leukemia, lymphoma, MM, NSCLC, pancreatic,
prostate, and RCC [233, 234]. Furthermore rapamycins
are being considered as anti-aging and anti-obestity drugs
as well as to prevent diabetic neuropathy [236-239].
The rapalogs torisel (Pfizer) amd afinitor (Novartis)
were approved in 2007 and 2009 (respectively) to treat
RCC patients [240]. In 2008, torisel was approved to treat
Mantel cell lymphoma patients. In 2010, Afinitor was
approved to treat subependymal giant cell astrocytoma
(SEGA) tumors in tuberous sclerosis (TS) patients.
In 2011, Afinitor was approved to treat patients with
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [241].
Ridaforolimus (also known as AP23573 and MK8669; formerly known as deforolimus) is a rapalog
developed by ARIAD and Merck. Ridaforolimus has
been evaluated in clinical trials with patients having
metastatic soft-tissue or bone sarcomas where it displays
promising results in terms of the risk of progression or
death [242]. Recently the ability of rapamycin and rapalog
to treat various viral infections including AIDS has been
considered [243,244]. Clearly rapamycin has proven to be
a very useful drug. In addition, novel approaches to target
mTORC have been developed (see below).

Sensitivity to Rapamycin

reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote resistance to
rapalogs. mTOR kinase inhibitors may be able to inhibit
ROS mediated rapalog resistance as they inhibit mTOR
independently of FKBP-12 [264]. Overexpression of
Bcl-2 and survivin can make certain cells resistant to the
apoptosis normally induced by rapalogs [265]. Inhibition
of angigogenesis is a potent aspect of rapalogs in vivo
[266]. Since HIF-1-alpha controls VEGF expression,
tumors with decreased VEGF expression are more
resistant to rapalogs. There are other strategies to
overcome mTOR resistance being examined. The effects
of combined dual targeting of mTOR and HSP90 are being
investigated [267].

Multiple mechanisms have been described to be
responsible for sensitivity to rapamycin [245]. Rapamycin
sensitivity has been associated with PTEN mutation/
silencing (inactivation), PIK3CA mutation (activation)
and Akt hyperactivation. RCC patients are hypersensitive
to rapalogs as they often have loss of function of the
von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene which
is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the proteasomal
degradation of HIF-1-alpha and HIF-1-beta [246].
Rapalogs promote reduction of HIF-1-alpha levels, thus
RCC cells can not survive and are hyper-sensitive to
rapalogs [247]. Mantel cell lymphoma grown in part due
to increased levels of cyclin D1. mTOR inhibitors suppress
cyclin D1 mRNA translation, thus Mantel cell lymphomas
are hypersensitive to rapalogs [248]. Inhibition of IGF-1R
signaling increases sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.

mTOR Inhibitors
Small molecules designed for inhibiting the
catalytic site of mTOR have shown promising effects on
suppression of signaling downstream of mTOR. mTOR
kinase inhibitor have been developed which directly
inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2. The mTOR kinase
inhibitors have advantages over rapamycin and rapalogs
as the mTOR inhibitors will inhibit both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 while rapamycin and rapalogs predominantly
inhibit mTORC1. Also the mTOR kinases inhibitors do
not induce the feedback pathways which result in Akt
activation.
OSI-027 is a pan mTOR inhibitor developed by
OSI Pharmaceuticals/Astellas Pharma Inc. OSI-027 is
effective in inducing apoptosis in different types of cancer,
including breast and leukemias [268,269]. OSI-027 has
been shown to inhibit the growth of imatinib-resistant
CML cells which contain the BCR-ABL T315I mutation
that are resistant to all BCR-ABL inhibitors [270]. OSI027 has been evaluated in a clinical trial (NCT00698243)
with patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma
[271].
PP-242 is a potent inhibitor of both mTORC1
and mTORC2 developed by Intellikine. INK-128 is a
derivative of PP-242 which has shown anti-tumoral effects
on multiple cancer types including RCC, MM, NHL
and prostate neoplasia [272-274]. INK-128 is in phase I
clinical trials (NCT01118689) for patients with relapsed
or refractory MM or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or
patients with solid malignancies (NCT01058707).
AZD8055 and AZD2014 are pan mTOR inhibitors
with potent anti-tumor activity that have been developed
by AstraZenica [275,276]. They are being evaluated in
a clinical trial (NCT01316809) with individuals with
gliomas who have not responded to standard glioma
therapies as well as other types of cancer patients.
Palomid 529 (Paloma Pharmaceuticals) is a pan
mTOR inhibitor which has potent anti-tumor affects and
reduces tumor angiogenesis and vascular permeability
[277]. Palomid 529 is undergoing phase I clinical trials
for patients with macular degeneration (NCT01033721).

Resistance to Rapamycin/Rapalogs
Resistance to rapamycin has been associated with
KRAS or BRAF mutations. Since KRAS is frequently
mutated in human cancer, many cancers will have
constitutive mTOR activity, but may not be sensitive to
rapamycin as they will have Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
activation. Since rapalogs function by binding FKBP-12,
mutations in FKBP12 or the FKB domain of mTOR can
suppress binding affinity and lead to rapalog resistance
[245,249-251]. Direct mTOR inhibitors will overcome
this resistance. The presence of the IGF1R/PI3K-mediated
feedback loop, which results in ERK activation, is another
mechanism of resistance to rapamycin rapalogs [3,4,6-10].
Up regulation of the PIM kinases is another
mechanism of resistance to rapalogs [252]. The PIM
family of oncogenic serine/threonine kinases play
important roles in the regulation of cell growth [253,254]
Pim kinases have multiple substrates important in the
regulation of cell growth including: c-Myc, p27, dual
specificity phosphatase CDC25A and Bad [252].
Pim kinases also stimulate mTORC1 activity by
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, eIF4E and PRAS [255-258].
PDK1 activation also results in resistance to rapalogs
[259]. This results in PDK1 phosphorylation of c-Myc
after rapamycin treatment. Altering the levels of 4EBP1 (decreasing) or eIF4E (increasing) can result in
resistance to rapamycin [260]. Some cells deficient in
p27Kip-1 are resistance to rapamycin as rapamycin normally
prevents p27Kip-1 down regulation [261]. There are other
mechanisms of resistance to rapamycin. One group has
determined that the levels of cyclin E-dependent kinase
activity are altered in resistant hepatic cells [262]
Increased oxidative stress induces mTORC1
modification which prevents its ability to bind the
FKBP-12/rapamycin complex [263]. High levels of

healthy CD34+ and CD34+/CD19+ bone marrow cells
were unaffected by FTY720. Furthermore, pharmacologic
doses of FTY720 suppressed in vivo BCR-ABL-driven
leukemogenesis (including leukemogenesis promoted by
the BCR-ABL T315I mutant which is resistant to imatinib
and second generation TKIs) without exerting any toxicity
in mice [296].

WAY600, WYE353, WYE687 and WYE132 were
developed by Wyeth (Pfizer). These inhibitors were
derived from WAY001 which was more specific for
PI3K-alpha than either mTORC1 or mTORC2. These
inhibitors were optimized which resulted in WYE132
(WYE125132)/ WYE132 has 5000-fold greater selectivity
for mTOR over PI3K. It caused tumor regression in breast,
glioma, lung, renal tumors [278].
Many other mTOR inhibitors have been described
which include: Ku0063794 (KuDOS Pharmaceuticals)
[279] and OXA-01 (OSI Pharmaceuticals) [280].
Torin2 has been developed by optimizing Torin1 [282].
TORKiCC223 is a pan mTOR inhibitor developed
by Celgene. Other companies are developing mTOR
inhibitors; clearly this is a very competitive but important
research and clinical area.
Metformin is an indirect inhibitor of mTORC1.
Metformin induces AMPK which turns on TSC1 which
suppresses mTORC1 activity [8,282]. Metformin may
also induce the phosphorylation and inactivation of
Raptor [283]. Diabetics treated with metformin have
lower incidences of cancer and also do not exhibit as much
aging [284,285]. Metformin may be able to prevent the
survival of certain CICs. Enhanced glycolysis (Warburg
effect) is critical for CICs [286-289]. Metformin disrupts
the glycolytic metabotype and alters the ATM-mediated
DNA damage response resulting in the acceleration of
stress-induced sencescence. Metformin in the presence of
suppressed mTOR signaling slows down aging and alters
the cellular senescence processes. Hence metformin can
alter the ability of cells to become immortalized into CICs
and slows down aging. By reducing the levels of DNA
damage signaling, metformin has genoprotective affects
[290,291].
A phase I clinical trial (NCT00659568) was
performed on analyzing the effects of combining
metformin with temsirolimus in patients with metastatic or
unresectable solid tumor or lymphomas and demonstrated
disease stabilization [292].
Inhibition of RHEB by farnesyltransferase (FT)
inhibitors is another mechanism to inhibit mTORC1 [293].
FT inhibitors have been extensively examined in clinical
trials [294].

Increasing the Effectiveness of Targeting the
Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
Pathways by Simultaneous Treatment with Two
Pathway Inhibitors.
The obvious goal of current inhibitor development
is to improve the effectiveness of treatment of cancer
patients with small molecule signal transduction inhibitors.
This has proven to be difficult for multiple reasons: first,
as previously discussed, there tends to be a distinct genetic
susceptibility for the success of a signal transduction
inhibitor in suppressing growth, second, many of the small
molecule signal transduction inhibitors are cytostatic as
opposed to being cytotoxic and therefore will need to
be combined with a therapeutic modality that induces
cell death, and third, more than one signal transduction
pathway may be activated in the cancer cells, which will
be discussed in detail below.
Previously, we have predominantly discussed
studies that employed a single Raf or MEK inhibitor,
sometimes in combination with a chemotherapeutic
drug. In the following section, we discuss the potential
of combining inhibitors that target two pathways to more
effectively limit cancer growth. In addition to the BRAF
mutations present in melanomas that we have previously
discussed, the PTEN phosphatase tumor suppressor gene is
also deleted in approximately 45% of melanomas and the
downstream AKT gene is amplified in approximately 45%.
Both of these mutations result in increased expression/
activity of Akt which is often associated with a poor
prognosis in human cancer. Increased Akt expression
will lead to mTOR activation and increased efficiency of
protein translation. Preclinical studies performed in human
melanoma cell lines have highlighted that co-targeting of
the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways
with Raf and Akt/mTOR inhibitors resulted in synergistic
inhibition [297]. Treatment of inducible murine lung
cancers containing KRAS and PIK3CA mutations with
PI3K/mTOR (NVP-BEZ235) and MEK (selumetinib)
inhibitors led to an enhanced response [298]. Synergistic
responses between sorafenib and mTOR inhibitors were
observed in xenograft studies with a highly metastatic
human HCC tumor [299]. Some recent studies in thyroid
cancer have documented the benefit of combining Raf and
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors [300].
Intermittent dosing of MEK and PI3K inhibitors has
been observed to suppress the growth of tumor xenografts

PP2A Activators
Successful targeting of the protein phosphatases
has in general not proceeded as rapidly as targeting of
protein kinases. FTY720 (fingolimod) is a PP2A activator
which has been approved as an immunomodulator
for oral use in patients with multiple sclerosis [295].
Reactivation of PP2A activity by FTY720 suppressed
cell growth, enhanced apoptosis, impaired clonogenicity,
and decreased in vivo leukemogenesis of imatinib- and
dasatinib-sensitive and -resistant Ph+ B-ALL cells, as well
as Ph+ B-ALL progenitors (CD34+/CD19+). Importantly,

Clinical Trials Based upon Inhibiting both the
Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
Pathways.

in mice [87]. This study demonstrated that continuous
administration of MEK and PI3K inhibitors is not required
to suppress xenograft growth. These important results
were obtained by performing washout studies in vitro and
alternate dosing schedules in mice with MEK and PI3K
inhibitors with BRAF and KRAS mutant cancer cells.
The combined effects of inhibiting MEK with PD0329501 and mTOR with rapamycin or its analog AP23573 (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals/Merck) were examined
in human NSCLC cell lines, as well as in animal models
of human lung cancer [301]. PD-0325901 and rapamycin
demonstrated synergistic inhibition of proliferation and
protein translation. Suppression of both MEK and mTOR
inhibited ribosomal biogenesis and was associated with a
block in the initiation phase of translation. The pan mTOR
inhibitor AZD-8055 has been examined as a single agent
and in combination with the MEK inhibitor AZD-6244 in
a NSCLC xenograft model. The combination resulted in
increased cell death and tumor regression [275,302]. These
preclinical results support suppression of both the MEK
and mTOR pathways in lung cancer therapy and indicate
that both pathways converge to regulate the initiation
of protein translation. ERK phosphorylates Mnk1/2
and p90Rsk, which regulate the activity of the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor eIF4E. The phosphorylation
of 4EBP1 is altered in cells with the BRAF mutation. It
should also be pointed out that the 4EBP1 is also regulated
by Akt, mTOR and p70S6K. This may result in the
efficient translation of certain mRNAs in BRAF-mutant
cells. This could explain how co-inhibition of MEK and
mTOR synergize to inhibit protein translation and growth
in certain lung cancer cells. mTOR inhibitors have been
combined with HSP90 inhibitors to overcome resistance
to rapamycin [267].
The effects of combining the MEK inhibitor
RDEA119 and rapamycin have been examined in various
cancers including pancreatic cancer [303]. The effects of
dual inhibition of IGF-1R and mTOR have been examined
in myeloma and other cancers [304]. Also the effectiveness
of combination of rapalogs and EGFR inhibitors to
inhibit glioblastoma growth is being examined [305]. The
antiproliferative effects of the Akt inhibitor perifosine
is improved when combined with nanoparticle-bound
rapamycin on multiple myeloma cells [306].
Treatment of vemurafenib-resistant BRAF-mutant
colorectal cancer cells with an Akt inhibitor (MK-2206)
overcame their resistance to vemurafenib [307]. Heat
shock inhibitors such as the HSP90 inhibitor XL888, have
been shown to inhibit proliferation of some vemurafenibresistant melanoma cells [308]. XL888 increased proapoptotic Bim expression and decreased Mcl-1 expression.
Also decreases in PDGFR-beta, COT, IGF-1R, Raf-1,
A-Raf, S6, cyclin D1 and Akt were observed. This lead
to nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a and resulted in
expression of the proapoptotic Bim protein.

Combinations of Raf and PI3K/mTOR or MEK and
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are in clinical trials. The results
of a phase 1 clinical trial on patients with advanced solid
tumors indicate that the combined dosing appears to be
well tolerated, at least as well as single agent dosing. Some
anti-tumor effects were observed and dose-escalation trials
were performed [309]. NCT01138085 is a clinical trial
combining MEK and Akt inhibitors (GSK1120212 and
GSK2141795 respectively). NCT01347866 is a clinical
trial for patients with advanced cancers combining the
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (PF-04691502 & PF-05212384)
with the MEK inhibitor (PD-0325901) or irinotecan. The
study will include patients with metastatic CRC who have
received previous therapy for their disease and whose
cancers have a mutant KRAS gene. The dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 is in a combination clinical trial
(NCT01482156) with RAD001 (everolimus) in patients
with advanced solid cancers. A phase 1 clinical trial
(NCT01337765) is in progress combining the MEK1/2
inhibitor MEK162 and the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor
NVP-BEZ-235. This combination will be evaluated in
various cancer patients, for example in NSCLC patients
containing mutations at EGFR who have progressed after
treatment with EGFR inhibitors or with patients with triple
negative breast, CRC, melanoma, and pancreatic cancers.
In addition, patients with other advanced solid tumors with
KRAS, NRAS, and/or BRAF mutations will be included
in this trial. NCT01390818 is a research trial testing a
combination of two experimental drugs, MSC1936369B
(a MEK inhibitor) and SAR245409 (a PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor), (EMD Serono and Sanofi) for the treatment
of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Patients
with breast, NSCLC, melanoma and colorectal cancers
will be treated with this inhibitor combination. A clinical
trial NCT01021748 is examining the effects of combining
MK2206 (Akt inhibitor) and AZD6244 (selumetinib,
MEK inhibitor) in cancer patients with advanced solid
tumors. NCT01519427 is a clinical trial combining
the MEK inhibitor selumetinib and the Akt inhibitor
MK2206 in patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma
that previously failed after treatment with vemurafenib
or dabrafenib. A diagram illustrating potential combined
inhibitor therapy to overcome resistance is presented in
Figure 5.

of cancer treatment. Optimizing chemotherapy with

(a.k.a tarceva, an EGFR inhibitor from Genenetec/OSI/
Roche) or lapatinib (a.k.a. tykerb, a dual EGFR and
HER2 inhibitor from GSK) or chemotherpapeutic drugs
(doxorubicin, camptothechin, gemcitabine, 5-flurouracil,
docetaxel or carboplatin resulted in synergistic responses
in lung (NCI-H460) and ovarian (A2780) cancer cell lines.
In some cases, the timing of drug addition was determined
to be important as MK-2206 suppressed the Akt activation
induced by carboplatin and gemcitabine [339]. The effects
of combining the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVPBEZ235 and various chemotherapeutic drugs as well as
other targeted therapies are being examined (doxorubicin,
melphalan, vincristine, bortezomib) [340,341]. The effects
of the pan mTOR inhibitor INK-128 could be enhanced by
the addition of sorafenib and avastin [272,273]. A clinical
trial (NCT01351350) with INK-128 in combination with
paclitaxel, either in the absence or presence of herceptin, is
in progress in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
The anti-tumor effects of the mTOR inhibitor WYE132
could be enhanced upon combination with avastin in lung
and breast xenograft models [278].
Clinical trials are ongoing based on combining
NVP-BEZ235 using inhibitors (BKM120, MEK162) and
the chemotherapeutic drug (paclitaxel) and herceptin to
treat advanced solid cancers and metastatic breast cancers
which are difficult to treat (see below). BKM120 is a panPI3K inhibitor. It is being included in some clinical studies
since NVP-BEZ235 does not inhibit PI3K-P110-β [242].
Furthermore NVP-BEZ235 is not effective in suppressing
the growth of tumors which have the KRAS G12D
mutation [343]. Thus to achieve effective suppression of
cancer growth in some situations, it maybe be important to
combine PI3K/mTOR inhibitors with pan PI3K inhibitors.
Palomid 529, a pan mTOR inhibitor, in some
circumstances is effective as a single agent. Importantly
when Palomid 529 was combined with either cisplatin
or docetaxel it had a better effect on hormone-refractory
prostate cancers [344]. It also improved the effects of
radiotherapy on prostate cancer cells [345].
As mentioned previously, a side effect of some
chemotherapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel, is the
induction of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Activation of
this pathway, can under certain circumstances, promote
proliferation and prevent apoptosis. Also the PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR pathway can modulate the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway and altering MEK activity can have opposing
effects on different cell types [346-349]. Combining
paclitaxel treatment with PI3K inhibitors enhances
apoptosis and inhibits growth of ovarian carcinoma
cell lines, and this may have been mediated in part by
suppression of inhibitory phosphorylation of Raf by Akt
[346]. In addition, the effects of combined treatment
with MEK inhibitors and paclitaxel have been examined.
The synergistic effects of paclitaxel and MEK inhibitors
are complex and not fully elucidated, but may be in part
mediated by inhibition of Bad phosphorylation at S112 by

targeted therapy may require genetic analysis to obtain
the best response which may also depend on the timing
of individual drug treatment [310-320]. Drugs such as
doxorubicin and taxol are effective in the treatment of
many cancers, even though in some cases drug resistance
develops after prolonged treatment. Doxorubicin, taxol and
other chemotherapeutic drugs alter cellular events, such as
DNA replication [321], DNA repair [322], cell division
[323-325], polyploidy [326], autophagy [327,328],
angiogenesis [329] or the tumor microenvironment
[330]. Often the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug are
dependent upon the TP53 gene status [331-334].
Chemotherapeutic drugs can activate the Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by diverse mechanisms. Drugs
such as doxorubicin can activate p53 which can lead to
increased expression of the discoidin domain receptor
(DDR), which in turn can result in Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway activation. Activated ERK can phosphorylate p53
and regulate its activity. Doxorubicin can also activate the
calcium calmodulin dependent kinase (CaM-K) cascade
via ROS [4,335]. Activation of this cascade can also
result in stimulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade which
induces the transcription of genes which are involved in
DNA repair and lead to drug resistance [4,335]. Taxols can
also stimulate activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade
and lead to their increased association with proteins
involved in cell division [336,337] Thus, by combining
classical chemotherapy with targeted therapy, it may be
possible to enhance toxicity, while lowering the prescribed
concentrations of classical chemotherapeutics necessary
for effective elimination of the tumor [337]. Activation
of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade can alter the activity and
subcellular localization of many proteins that play critical
roles in apoptotic cascades. Also the Raf/MEK/ERK
cascade can regulate the transcription of many critical
genes involved in cell cycle progression, growth and
differentiation [3,4].
The 5 year survival rate for CRC is less than 10%,
thus novel therapies are required to improve treatment
of this cancer. KRAS is often mutated in CRC, thus the
Raf/MEK/ERK pathway will be activated. The effects of
combining the MEK inhibitor selumetinib with vorinostat
[a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor] were examined
in a recent study [338]. Combining the two inhibitors
resulted in a synergistic response in vitro, while an
additive response was observed in vivo.
Treatment of mice xenografted with vemurafenibresistant BRAF-mutant CRCs with various combinations
of vermurafenib and chemotherapeutic drugs
(capecitabine, irinotecan), monoclonal antibodies
[bevacizumab a.k.a avastin, targets VEGF-alpha, Roche/
Genentech), cetuximab (a.k.a erbitux, targets EGFR,
Imclone/Eli Lilly)], or the small molecule Akt inhibitor
MK-2206, or the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib increased
survival [307]. Combination of the Akt inhibitor MK2206 and either EGFR/HER2 targeted therapy [erlotinib

ERK in UM-SCC-23 squamous carcinoma cell line [348].
The cytotoxic effects of combinations of MEK
inhibitors and paclitaxel may be specific for cells
of certain origins and may depend on the levels of
endogenous activated MEK/ERK present in those cells. In
a study with NSCLC cells which constitutively-expressed
activated MEK/ERK, no increase in paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis was observed when the cells were treated with a
MEK inhibitor [347]. In contrast, addition of a dominant
negative (DN) MEK gene to these cells potentiated
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.
Cisplatin-induced apoptosis was associated with
increased levels of both p53 and the downstream Bax
protein in a study with neuroblastoma cells [348].
Activated ERK1/ERK2 levels also increased in these
cells upon cisplatin treatment. MEK inhibitors blocked
apoptotic cell death, which prevented the cisplatin-induced
accumulation of p53 and Bax proteins [348].
It should be noted that the combination of MEK
inhibitors and chemotherapeutic drugs may not always
result in a synergistic interaction leading to cell death. In
some cases, combination therapy results in an antagonistic
response. For example, combining MEK inhibitors
with betulinic acid, a drug toxic for melanoma cells,
antagonized the normal enhancing effects of betulinic
acid on apoptosis in vitro [349]. Furthermore, the precise
timing of the addition of two agents is important as they
may differentially affect cell-cycle progression; therefore,
the order of administration may be important for a
synergistic response to be obtained and perhaps to prevent
an antagonistic response.
There are few effect therapeutic options for HCC.
Combination of rapamycin with conventional cytostatic
drugs such as doxorubicin and vinblastine enhances the
antineoplastic activity of the respective monotherapeutic
HCC treatment obtained with either doxorubicin or
vinblastine alone [350,351]. Taken together, the in vitro
and preclinical in vivo data as well as the clinical trials
conducted so far demonstrate that mTOR inhibitors are
promising agents for HCC treatment, particularly in
combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drug
therapy.
The effects of sorafenib on the treatment of HCC
patients were examined in a clinical trial [350]. A phase
II trial demonstrated that the combination of sorafenib
and doxorubicin improved progression-free and overall
survival of patients with advanced HCC [351]. Moreover,
a phase II trial (NCT00464919) was performed to
determine the progression-free survival of sorafenib plus
tegafur/uracil (UFUR) for the treatment of advanced or
metastatic HCC. The study indicated that UFUR can be
safely combined with sorafenib and may improve the
efficacy of sorafenib in advanced HCC patients [352].
The effects of inhibiting Akt in combination with
other signaling pathways and chemotherapy are being
evaluated in numerous phase I clinical trials. These trials
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

highlight the importance of targeting multiple molecules to
suppress the growth of cancer which are resistant to most
therapies. A combination clinical trial (NCT01245205)
with the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 and the dual EGFR/
HER2 inhibitor lapatinib is in progress with patients
having advanced or metastatic solid tumors or breast
cancer patients. NCT00848718 is a clinical trial with
patients having advanced cancers to examine the effects
of combining MK-2206 and the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib,
docetaxel, or carboplatin + paclitaxel. NCT00963547
was a clinical trial with HER2+ breast cancer patients
to examine the effects of combining MK2206 with
trastuzumab (herceptin) and lapatinib. NCT01245205 and
NCT01281163 are clinical trials examining the effects
of combining MK2206 with lapatinib in cancer patients
with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or breast cancer
or just breast cancers, respectively. NCT01147211 is a
clinical trial with NSCLC patients examining the effects
of combining MK-2206 with gefitinib (a.k.a. Iressa, EGFR
inhibitor developed by AstraZenica). NCT01344031 is

cancer patients examining the effects of combining
anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane (aromatase-inhibitors),
or fulvestrant (an estrogen receptor antagonist).
NCT01369849 is a clinical trial examining the effects
of combining MK2206, with bendamustin (nitrogen
mustard alkylating agent) and rituximab (a.k.a. Rituxan, a
chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 from IDEC
Pharmaceuticals/Genenetec) on CLL cancer patients who

Enhancing Effectiveness of Raf/MEK and PI3K/
mTOR Inhibitors with Radiotherapy.
Radiotherapy is a common therapeutic approach for
treatment of many diverse cancers [353]. Radiotherapy
often induces DNA double strand breaks [354]. The
successfulness of radiotherapy is often governed by the
functionality of p53 and its affects on apoptosis [355,356].
1091

The ability to improve the effects of radiotherapy with
small molecule inhibitors is an area of active research
interest [357].
A side effect of radiotherapy in some cells is
induction of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade [3,4].
Various signal transduction inhibitors have been evaluated
as radiosensitizers. The effects of pre-treatment of lung,
pancreatic and prostate cancer cells with selumetinib
were evaluated in vitro using human cell lines and in vivo
employing xenografts [358]. The MEK inhibitor treatment
radiosensitized various cancer cell lines in vitro and in
vivo. The MEK inhibitor treatment was correlated with
decreased Chk1 phosphorylation 1-2 hrs after radiation.
The authors noticed the effects of the MEK inhibitor
on the G2 checkpoint activation after irradiation, as the
MEK inhibitor suppressed G2 checkpoint activation. Since
ERK1/ERK2 activity is necessary for carcinoma cells to
arrest at the G2 checkpoint, suppression of phosphorylated
Chk1 was speculated to lead to the abrogated G2
checkpoint, increased mitotic catastrophe and impaired
activation of cell cycle checkpoints. Chk1/Chk2 as serine/
threonine kinases. Chk/Chk2 are important controlling
regulators of DNA repair and cell cycle progression. DNA
damage responses which signal through ATM and ATR
activate the DNA damage transducers Chk1 and Chk2
[359-383].
Mitotic catastrophe was increased in cancer cells
receiving both the MEK inhibitor selumetinib and
radiation when compared to the solo-treated cells [358].
Suppression of MEK activity resulted in decreased
phosphorylated Chk1 leading to the abrogated G2
checkpoint. It was also postulated in this study that
the MEK inhibitor suppressed the autocrine cascade
in DU145 prostate cancer cells that normally resulted
from EGF secretion and EGFR activation. Suppression
of this autocrine cascade by the MEK inhibitor may
have served as a radiosensitizer to the radiation therapy.
The other two cancer cell lines examined in this study
(A549 and MiaPaCa2) had KRAS mutations and both
were radiosensitized by the MEK inhibitor. Although
these studies document the ability of a MEK inhibitor
to radiosensitize certain cells, clearly other cancer cell
lines without activating mutations in the Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway or autocrine growth stimulation should be
examined for radiosensitization by the MEK inhibitor as
the KRAS mutation may also activate the PI3K pathway
which could lead to therapy resistance.
PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors will sensitize the tumor
vasculature to radiation both in vitro in cell lines and in
vivo in xenografts [384,385]. mTOR and radiation play
critical roles in the regulation of autophagy [386,387].
These studies document the potential beneficial use of
combining mTOR inhibitors and radiation to improve the
induction of autophagy in the treatment of solid tumors.
This is important as apoptotic cell death is a minor
component to cell death in solid tumors. When mTOR is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

blocked by rapamycin there is an increase in autophagy
[388-393]. mTORC1 is a repressor of autophagy, a
lysosome-dependent degradation pathway which allows
cells to recycle damaged or superfluous cytoplasmic
content, such as lipids, proteins, and organelles. As
a consequence, cells produce metabolic precursors
for macromolecular biosynthesis or ATP generation
[392]. In cancer cells, autophagy fulfils a dual role, as
it has both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing
properties. Autophagy is also an important component
in hematopoietic cancers and some therapy-resistant
cells have defects in autophagy [394-396] Functional
autophagy prevents necrosis and inflammation, which
can lead to genetic instability. However, autophagy might
be important for tumor progression by providing energy
through its recycling mechanism during unfavorable
metabolic circumstances, which are very common in
tumors [397-399].

Conclusions
Inhibitors to the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways have been isolated and
developed by various screening approaches and then in
some cases modified by medicinal chemistry. Initially
MEK and mTOR inhibitors were demonstrated to have
the most specificity. However, MEK inhibitors may have
limited effectiveness in treating human cancers, unless
the particular cancer proliferates directly in response
to the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. A similar scenario is
also true with mTOR inhibitors, they are most effective
when there is a mutation which deregulates the PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways. Moreover, MEK inhibitors
are often cytostatic as opposed to cytotoxic, thus their
ability to function as effective anti-cancer agents in a
monotherapeutic setting is limited, and they may be more
effective when combined with chemo- or radiotherapy
or an inhibitor which targets a different pathway or even
an inhibitor which targets the same pathway. Rapamycin
and rapalogs are being used to treat certain cancers which
proliferate in response to mutations in regulatory genes
which control the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway. Raf
inhibitors have also been developed and some are being
used to treat various cancer patients (e.g., sorafenib, HCC).
This particular Raf inhibitor also inhibits other receptors
and kinases which may be required for the growth of the
particular cancer. This promiscuous nature of sorafenib
has contributed to the effectiveness of this particular
Raf inhibitor for certain cancers. Raf inhibitors such as
vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and GDC-0879 are promising
for the treatment of melanoma, CRC, thyroid and other
solid cancers and leukemias/lymphomas/myelomas which
have mutations at BRAF V600E. However, problems have
been identified with certain BRAF mutant allele inhibitors
as they will also result in Raf-1 activation if RAS is
mutated/amplified of if an exon of BRAF is deleted, or
1092

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 1068-1111

if BRAF is amplified or if there are mutations at MEK1
and other genetic mechanisms. Combination therapy with
either a traditional drug/physical treatment or another
inhibitor that targets a specific molecule in a different
signal transduction pathway is also a key approach for
improving the effectiveness and usefulness of MEK and
Raf inhibitors.
Modified rapamycins, rapalogs are being used to
treat various cancer patients, (e.g., patients with RCC).
While rapalogs are effective and their toxicity profiles
are well known, one inherent property is that they are
not very cytotoxic when it comes to killing tumor cells.
This inherent property of rapamycins, may also contribute
to their low toxicity in humans. Interestingly and highly
relevant, it has been observed that certain inhibitors which
target “growth and metabolism” such as rapamycin and
metformin may have very potent anti-cancer and antiaging effects [233-239, 284-291]
Mutations at many of the upstream receptor genes
or RAS can result in abnormal Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway activation. Hence targeting
these cascade components with small-molecule inhibitors
may inhibit cell growth. The usefulness of these inhibitors
may depend on the mechanism of transformation of the
particular cancer. If the tumor exhibits a dependency on
the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, then it may be sensitive
to Raf and MEK inhibitors. In contrast, tumors that do
not display enhanced expression of the Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway may not be sensitive to either Raf or MEK
inhibitors but if the Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is
activated, it may be sensitive to specific inhibitors that
target this pathway. Some promising recent observations
indicate that certain CICs may be sensitive to mTOR
inhibitors [3,4.6,7,195,196,216,400-404] and metformin
[8,129,269,286,287,405,406], documenting their potential
use in the elimination of the cells responsible for cancer
re-emergence. Finally, it is likely that many of the
inhibitors that we have discussed in this review will be
more effective in inhibiting tumor growth in combination
with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation.
Some scientists and clinicians have considered that
the simultaneous targeting of Raf and MEK by individual
inhibitors may be more effective in cancer therapy than
just targeting Raf or MEK by themselves. This is based
in part on the fact that there are intricate feed-back loops
from ERK which can inhibit Raf and MEK. For example
when MEK1 is targeted, ERK1,2 is inhibited and the
negative feed-back loop on MEK is broken and activated
MEK accumulates. However, if Raf is also inhibited, it
may be possible to completely shut down the pathway.
This is a rationale for treatment with either dual Raf/MEK
inhibitors or simultaneously with both Raf and MEK
individual inhibitors. Likewise targeting both PI3K and
mTOR may be more effective than targeting either PI3K
or mTOR by themselves. If it is a single inhibitor which
targets both molecules, such as the new PI3K and mTOR
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dual inhibitors this becomes a realistic therapeutic option.
Also in some cases it may be necessary to eliminate the
cancer by treatment with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor as
well as with an additional PI3K inhibitor which suppresses
the PI3K-p110-delta isoform as certain dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors do not effectively suppress this isoform. Finally,
an emerging concept is the dual targeting of two different
signal transduction pathways, Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR for example. This has been explored
in some preclinical models as well as clinical trials as
discussed in the text. The rationale for the targeting of
both pathways may be dependent on the presence of
mutations in either/or both pathways or in upstream Ras
in the particular cancer which can activate both pathways.
It is not always clear why a particular combination
of a signal transduction inhibitor and chemotherapeutic
drug works in one tumor type but not at all in a different
tumor type. This has also been experience with the
development of individual chemotherapeutic drugs, some
work in some cancers but not others. This may result
from many different complex interacting events. Some of
these events could include: percentage of cells in different
phases of the cell cycle, persistence of CICs, presence of
multiple mutated activated oncogene or repressed tumor
suppressor genes, epigenetic modifications and many
other factors. Finally, chemotherapeutic drug therapy and
other types of therapy (radiotherapy, antibody therapy)
may induce certain signaling pathways (e.g., the ROS
generated by chemotherapy and radiotherapy induce the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway). The induction of these
signalling pathways may counteract some of the effects of
the signal transduction inhibitors.
A problem with some of the preceding studies is
that most of the resistant cells were derived after culturing
cells in vitro for prolonged periods of time in the presence
of increasing doses of B-Raf inhibitors. The clinical
relevance of these mechanisms of resistance awaits
their identification in resistant samples from melanoma
and other cancer patients treated with these inhibitors.
Furthermore, many of the studies were performed on
different established melanoma cell lines which have
various additional mutations besides those in BRAF that
may or may not be relevant for actual melanomas present
in patients. Finally the various melanoma cell lines may
be at different stages of differentiation and thus the genes
involved in resistance in vitro, may be different from what
is observed in other classes (stages of differentiation) of
melanoma in vivo. Interesting, increased drug transporter
activity has not been reported in the limited number of
B-Raf inhibitor-resistant samples investigated, where
it has been observed in other cancer types treated with
diverse small molecule inhibitors and/or chemotherapeutic
drugs.
Scientists and clinicians often have an intentionally
narrow view of a particular topic. For example, cancer
researchers predominantly feel that Raf, MEK, PI3K,
1093

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 1068-1111

Akt and mTOR inhibitors will suppress the growth
of malignant cancer cells. Yet MEK and mTOR and
other inhibitors may also be useful in the treatment of
autoimmune or allergic disorders where there is abnormal
cellular proliferation. Recently it has been observed that
the suppression of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathways may prevent the induction of cellular
senescence and aging. Clearly, these later two clinical
topics, immune disorders and aging, greatly enhance the
potential clinical uses of these targeted therapeutic drugs.
