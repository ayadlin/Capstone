Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are noncoding RNAs that regulate multiple cellular processes, including proliferation
and apoptosis. We used microarray technology to identify miRNAs that were upregulated by non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells in response to cisplatin (CDDP). The corresponding synthetic miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) per se were not lethal when transfected into A549 cells yet affected cell death induction by
CDDP, C2-ceramide, cadmium, etoposide, and mitoxantrone in an inducer-specific fashion. Whereas synthetic
miRNA inhibitors (anti-miRNAs) targeting miR-181a and miR-630 failed to modulate the response of A549 to
CDDP, pre-miR-181a and pre-miR-630 enhanced and reduced CDDP-triggered cell death, respectively. PremiR-181a and pre-miR-630 consistently modulated mitochondrial/postmitochondrial steps of the intrinsic
pathway of apoptosis, including Bax oligomerization, mitochondrial transmembrane potential dissipation,
and the proteolytic maturation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. In addition, pre-miR-630 blocked early manifestations of the DNA damage response, including the phosphorylation of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
kinase and of two ATM substrates, histone H2AX and p53. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of p53 corroborated the hypothesis that pre-miR-630 (but not pre-miR-181a) blocks the upstream signaling pathways
that are ignited by DNA damage and converge on p53 activation. Pre-miR-630 arrested A549 cells in the G0-G1
phase of the cell cycle, correlating with increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 as well as with reduced proliferation rates and resulting in greatly diminished sensitivity of A549 cells to the late S-G2-M cell
cycle arrest mediated by CDDP. Altogether, these results identify miR-181a and miR-630 as novel modulators
of the CDDP response in NSCLC. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1793–803. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Cisplatin (CDDP) is one of the principal chemotherapeutic
agents used for the treatment of non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), a frequent and aggressive form of lung cancer that
is responsible for more than 1 million deaths worldwide annually (1, 2). Usually, an initial success associated with partial

responses or disease stabilization is followed by the selection
of chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells, leading to chemotherapeutic failure (3, 4). Thus, the elucidation of the mechanisms of chemoresistance to CDDP may have important
therapeutic implications for the management of NSCLC.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNA molecules
that inhibit gene expression at the posttranscriptional level.
Thus, miRNA binding to the 3′ untranslated region of target
mRNAs can result in mRNA degradation or translation inhibition, depending on the degree of complementary base pairing (5). Since the discovery of lin-4 in Caenorhabditis elegans
(6), more than 4,500 miRNAs have emerged as epigenetic regulators in organisms as diverse as vertebrates, flies, worms,
plants, and viruses (5, 7, 8). This number is destined to grow
in the future with the discovery of other miRNA-encoding
loci. Recent computational estimations suggest that each
miRNA regulates ∼200 target mRNAs, implying that more
than one third of protein-coding genes are controlled by
miRNAs. It is therefore no surprise that miRNAs regulate
multiple processes, including metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, development, and cell death (5). Aberrant miRNA expression has been associated with oncogenesis, and
some miRNAs act as bona fide tumor suppressors, whereas
others as oncogenes (9). Moreover, miRNA expression profiling may have both diagnostic and prognostic value (10).

Galluzzi et al.

Driven by these observations, we decided to investigate
whether miRNAs play a role in the apoptotic response triggered by CDDP in human NSCLC A549 cells. Microarray analysis allowed us to identify miRNAs that are specifically
upregulated by CDDP, as well as miRNAs whose levels also
change in response to other proapoptotic agents such as
C 2 -ceramide (C 2 -CER) and cadmium dichloride (CdCl 2 ).
Here, we describe the molecular pathways of CDDP-induced
apoptosis that are regulated by miR-181a, which has previously been shown to exert tumor-suppressive functions in
glioma cells (11), and by miR-630, which to the best of our
knowledge has not been studied in detail before.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, cell cultures, and transfections. Unless
otherwise indicated, chemicals were purchased from SigmaAldrich and culture media were from Life TechnologiesInvitrogen. NSCLC A549, H1650, H1975, and HCC827 cells
[American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)]; colon carcinoma
HCT116 cells (kindly provided by Bert Vogelstein, Sidney
Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, routinely tested for p53 status by immunoblotting; see ref. 12);
and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured in
standard conditions (13, 14). A549 cells were transfected with
a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Bax–coding plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Shigemi Matsuyama, Case Western Reserve
University, Cleveland, OH; ref. 15), as described (16). On selection with 1 mg/mL G418, individual clones were isolated on a
FACSVantage cell sorter (BD Biosciences). miRNA precursors
(pre-miR) and inhibitors (anti-miR) were purchased from
Ambion; control (siUNR; ref. 14) and p53-targeting (sip53)
small interfering RNAs (siRNA; ref. 17) were from Sigma-Proligo. A549 and HeLa cells were transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), whereas HCT116 cells were transfected
with HiPerFect (Qiagen).
MicroRNAome analysis, cytofluorometry, and cell proliferation tests. Total RNA was extracted and processed as previously described (14) and then hybridized to G4470A 15K
Human miRNA Microarrays (Agilent Technologies). miRNA
microarrays underwent standard posthybridization processing and image acquisition (18). Apoptosis-related parameters and cell cycle distribution were assessed by means of
a FACSCalibur cytofluorometer (BD Biosciences), as previously described (19–22). Cell proliferation was quantified by
means of the WST-1 kit (Roche; refs. 14, 23).
Immunoblotting and (automated) (immuno)fluorescence microscopy. A549 cells were lysed in “semireducing”
(1% CHAPS, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl + protease
inhibitor tablets from Roche) or “fully reducing” (1% NP40,
20 mmol/L HEPES, 10 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10%
glycerol, 1 mmol/L orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L DTT + protease inhibitor tablets)
conditions followed by standard immunoblotting (24, 25)
with antibodies (from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., unless
otherwise indicated) specific for Bax (Upstate), caspase-3,
caspase-9, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon International), p21Waf1 (Oncogene Research Products),

p27Kip1, phospho-p53(Ser15), phospho-p53(Ser46), p53, and
Puma. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as
previously described (18, 26), with antibodies recognizing
phospho–ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM; Ser1981; Upstate) and phospho-H2AX(Ser139) [histone H2AX (γ-H2AX),
from Trevigen]. For automated fluorescence microscopy, a
BD Pathway 855 High-Content BioImager (BD Biosciences)
was used, followed by image processing with BD AttoVision
(BD Biosciences) software. The region of interest (ROI) was
defined by a 10-pixel ring mask around the nucleus. GFP-Bax
granularity was evaluated by comparing the SD of the mean
fluorescence intensity of groups of adjacent pixels within a
ROI with the mean fluorescence intensity of the entire ROI
and normalized to the granularity of mock-transfected cells.
The percentage of phospho-ATM and γ-H2AX positivity was
assessed by scoring cells that exhibited more than five very
bright nuclear spots (DNA damage foci).
Statistical procedures. Unless otherwise specified, experiments were performed in triplicate parallel instances and independently repeated at least twice. Data were analyzed with
Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Co.), and statistical significance
was assessed by means of two-tailed Student's t test (P <
0.05, adjusted with Bonferroni's correction) or one-way ANOVA
test, as appropriate. Immunofluorescence microscopy quantitative assessments were performed among a population of at
least 100 cells per experimental condition, in duplicate parallel
instances, and repeated twice, yielding similar results.

Results and Discussion
CDDP-specific changes in the microRNAome of A549
cells. NSCLC A549 cells were exposed for 24/48 hours to
CDDP or two other chemicals that induce mitochondrial cell
death (27), C2-CER (28) and CdCl2 (29), which we used as
controls for chemotherapy-unrelated stress responses. All
these agents induced classic manifestations of apoptosis, including dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential [Δψ m ; detected with DiOC 6 (3)] and plasma
membrane breakdown [monitored with propidium iodide
(PI); ref. 19], with comparable dose-response curves (at
48 hours) yet slightly different kinetics (Fig. 1A, see data at
24 hours). To determine the effect of CDDP, C2-CER, and
CdCl2 on miRNA expression levels (by microarray technology), A549 cells were exposed for 12 hours to the LD50 of these
agents as determined at 24 hours (or for 24 hours to the LD50
of these compounds as determined for 48 hours). This choice
was driven by the consideration that exposure to the LD50 of
an agent for half of the time required to achieve half-maximal
killing would have minor proapoptotic effects, thereby allowing for the study of microRNAome modifications linked to
preapoptotic signaling pathways rather than to unspecific
degradative phenomena that operate at end-stage cell death
(Supplementary Table S1). Accordingly, hierarchical clustering of the most significant changes in miRNA expression levels (as determined by means of G4470A 15K Human miRNA
Microarrays, which include probes for 470 human miRNAs
and one-way ANOVA test) resulted in substance-specific
rather than time-related profiles (Fig. 1B). Importantly,

miRNA-Dependent Regulation of Apoptosis in NSCLC Cells

whereas the abundance of multiple miRNAs was modulated
in a similar fashion by C2-CER and CdCl2, CDDP induced a
more specific pattern of modifications (Fig. 1B). In contrast
to C2-CER and CdCl2, which triggered a rather generalized
reduction in miRNA abundance, CDDP tended to increase
the expression levels of multiple miRNAs (Fig. 1C). In line
with this observation and with the results from the hierarchical clustering (Fig. 1B), C2-CER–induced and CdCl2-induced

microRNAome changes presented a consistent overlap that
was not shared with CDDP, which rather exhibited a relevant
inducer-specific miRNA signature (Fig. 1C; Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3). hsa-miR-181a and hsa-miR-630
(which we will refer to as miR-181a and miR-630) were the
miRNAs that were most robustly upregulated by CDDP
(Table 1; Supplementary Table S1). Whereas only CDDP induced the upregulation of miR-181a, the expression levels of

miR-630 were also significantly augmented by C2-CER and
CdCl2 (Table 1).
Modulation of CDDP-induced cell death by selected
miRNAs. A549 cells were transfected for 48 hours with synthetic precursors of the miRNAs (pre-miRNA) whose expression changed most intensely on CDDP administration,
and then monitored for cell cycle progression and apoptosisrelated parameters (Fig. 2). At this time point, some miRNA
precursors slightly distorted the cell cycle distribution, although none of them induced a G2-M arrest that would be
comparable with the one triggered by a sublethal dose
(10 μmol/L) of CDDP (Fig. 2A). Thus, whereas pre-miR-210
and pre-miR-765 provoked a minor G 2 -M blockage, premiR-7, pre-miR-654, and, most notably, pre-miR-181a and
pre-miR-630 induced a slight but significant (5–15%) increase
in the percentage of A549 cells with a G0-G1 DNA content
(Fig. 2B). Such cell cycle–modulatory effects were weaker in
cervical cancer HeLa cells and more pronounced in colorectal
carcinoma HCT116 cells, irrespective of the presence or absence of p53 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Although the administration of CDDP for 48 hours killed ∼50% of A549 cells, at the
same point none of the miRNA precursors did induce significant levels of cell death (Fig. 2C and D). In contrast, in HeLa
and HCT116 cells, some and most miRNAs, respectively, induced considerable cell death, although in p53−/− HCT116
cells the lethal effects of all miRNA precursors were largely
reduced (Supplementary Fig. S2). Altogether, these results
point to the existence of cell type–specific and p53-dependent
signaling pathways that are modulated by miRNAs.
As we could not detect any lethal effects of miRNA precursors per se on A549 cells, we next studied their capacity to
modulate their apoptotic response to a variety of proapoptotic compounds, including CDDP, C2-CER, CdCl2, etoposide,

and mitoxantrone, all of which were administered for 48 hours
at their LD50 (defined as the dose that induces plasma membrane breakdown and/or Δψm dissipation in half of the cells).
Indeed, these miRNA precursors exerted profound cell death–
regulatory effects when cells responded to exogenous agents
(Fig. 3). When we ordered the effects of miRNA precursors on
CDDP-induced cell death from the most sensitizing (left) to
the most cytoprotective (right) ones and maintained the same
order for the results related to the other cytotoxic agents
(Fig. 3), it became obvious that each compound differs from
CDDP with respect to its profile of miRNA-dependent cell
death regulation. Thus, CDDP cytotoxicity was globally
regulated by individual miRNAs in a fashion that did not
correspond to the profiles associated with C2-CER, CdCl2, etoposide, and mitoxantrone (Fig. 3). The profiles of miRNAmediated cell death sensitization/protection that were most
closely related to each other were those of etoposide and mitoxantrone, in line with the notion that these compounds (at
least partially) operate as topoisomerase II inhibitors (30, 31).
Altogether, these results indicate that miRNAs can affect the
apoptotic response of the same cell type to different cell death
inducer in a stimulus-dependent fashion.
miRNA-mediated modulation of the caspase cascade. As
miR-181a and miR-630 were the miRNAs that were most robustly upregulated by CDDP (Table 1) and both modulated
the response of A549 cells to CDDP, we decided to further
investigate their cell death–regulatory effects. To rule out
the possibility that pre-miR-181a and pre-miR-630 might exert apoptosis-modulatory effects via nonspecific off-target effects, we used the corresponding synthetic miRNA inhibitors
(anti-miRNAs) anti-miR-181a and anti-miR-630. Although
anti-miRNAs alone failed to modify the response to CDDP of
A549 cells, they fully abrogated the sensitizing and protective

determinations (Figs. 3 and 4A), we found that pre-miR181a and pre-miR-630 enhanced and reduced, respectively,
the proteolytic maturation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 triggered by CDDP. Thus, whereas CDDP induced a minor yet
detectable increase in the abundance of the cleaved fragments of both caspase-9 and caspase-3 in mock-transfected
cells, pre-miR-181a–transfected cells responded to CDDP by
massively activating caspases (which could also be monitored
by decreased levels of both procaspase-9 and procaspase-3;
Fig. 4B).
miRNA-mediated modulation of the p53 system. We then
investigated possible effects of miR-181a and miR-630 on the
abundance, phosphorylation status, and transcriptional activity of the master regulator of CDDP-induced cell death
p53 (32). By immunoblotting with phosphoneoepitopespecific antibodies, we found that pre-miR-181a barely affected,
whereas pre-miR-630 robustly inhibited the phosphorylation
of p53 on Ser15 and Ser46 [both of which are involved in the
proapoptotic accumulation of p53 (33)] triggered by CDDP
in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). At 24 hours, however, this
effect was not paralleled by changes in the total levels of p53,
nor in its global activity as a transcription factor, as assessed
by monitoring the expression of the two p53 targets Puma
(a proapoptotic protein from the Bcl-2 family) and p21Waf1
(a cyclin-dependent kinase 1 inhibitor; 18). However, we observed that (on CDDP treatment) pre-miR-181a–transfected
and pre-miR-630–transfected cells contained slightly increased and decreased (respectively) levels of another protein
that belongs to the early p53 transcriptional network (34), the
proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family Bax (Fig. 4B). The exact reasons underlying these observations (such as a differential affinity of p53 for the promoters of Puma, Waf1, and Bax)
remain elusive. Finally, both pre-miR-181a and pre-miR-630
induced, although to different extents, the upregulation of the
cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, which in pre-miR-630–transfected
(but not in pre-miR-181a–transfected) cells was further increased by CDDP (Fig. 4B).
To check whether p53 is required for the sensitizing and
protective effects mediated by miR-181 and miR-630, respectively, we challenged mock-transfected or pre-miRNA–
transfected A549 cells with CDDP alone or in combination
with the pharmacologic p53 inhibitor cyclic pifithrin-α
(PIF-α; 35; Supplementary Fig. S5A and C). Alternatively, cells
were cotransfected with pre-miRNAs and either a control or
a p53-targeting siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S5B and D). Both
pharmacologic and siRNA-mediated inhibition of p53 partially reduced the pre-miR-181a–mediated sensitization of A549
cells to per se sublethal doses of CDDP (Supplementary
Fig. S5A and B). In line with previous reports (18, 23, 26), both
PIF-α and partial p53 depletion protected A549 cells against

an overtly proapoptotic dose of CDDP, and an even more
pronounced cytoprotection was conferred by pre-miR-630.
Importantly, the effects of pre-miR-630 were not amplified
by p53 inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S5B and D). Altogether, these results suggest that miR-630 protects A549 cells
against CDDP by operating on the same signaling pathway
than (and presumably upstream of) p53. Recently, PIF-α
has been shown to protect human colon carcinoma
HCT116 cells against DNA damage–induced apoptosis downstream of mitochondria and independently of p53 (36). In our
experimental setting, however, the effects of PIF-α were consistently mimicked by transfection with a p53-specific siRNA,
underscoring the actual contribution of p53 to pre-miR-630–
mediated cytoprotection.
miRNA-mediated modulation of Bax activation. As Bax
promotes cell death by forming channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane (through which the caspase-9 activator cytochrome c is released; refs. 27, 37), we determined
the dimerization/oligomerization of Bax by extracting proteins in semireducing conditions followed by standard immunoblotting. Only in CDDP-treated samples could we
detect one band that was compatible with Bax oligomers
(i.e., exhibiting a molecular weight multiple of ∼21 kDa,
which characterizes monomeric Bax). The intensity of this
band was significantly enhanced and diminished by premiR-181a and pre-miR-630, respectively (Fig. 4C, left). When
the same protein extracts were subjected to fully reducing
conditions (presence of DTT, incubation at 100°C), which
resolved nearly all protein-to-protein interactions, the aforementioned band became barely detectable even on overexposure (Fig. 4C, right). In these conditions, monomeric
Bax seemed slightly underrepresented in the sample
corresponding to pre-miR-181a–transfected CDDP-treated
A549 cells, presumably due to the persistence of higher molecular weight species (Fig. 4C, right, please note the tiny
yet discernible band at a molecular weight of ∼63 kDa,
corresponding to oligomeric Bax). Similar results were obtained by monitoring Bax aggregation in A549 cells engineered for the stable expression of GFP-Bax. CDDP
administration progressively increased the granularity of
the GFP signal (indicative of Bax aggregation, as assessed
by fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis),
and this was enhanced and reduced in cells that had been
transfected with pre-miR-181a and pre-miR-630, respectively
(Fig. 4D; Supplementary Video S1).
miRNA-mediated modulation of CDDP-mediated cell
cycle arrest. Intrigued by the observation that p27Kip1 was
induced by both pre-miR-181a and pre-miR-630 (Fig. 4B),
we further studied their possible effects on the cell cycle,
knowing that CDDP preferentially kills proliferating cells
(14). Cell cycle distributions were determined for A549 cells
that had been mock, pre-miR-181a, and pre-miR-630 transfected for 72 hours and incubated during the last 24 hours
of transfection with a subapoptotic concentration of CDDP,
which at 24 hours induces a consistent late S-G2-M cell cycle
blockage that represents the premise of (and can be qualitatively discriminated from) the exquisite G2-M arrest observed
at 48 hours (Fig. 2; ref. 38). The slight G0-G1 blockage induced

1800

Cancer Res; 70(5) March 1, 2010

by pre-miR-181a and pre-miR-630 at 48 hours (Fig. 2) was
more pronounced at 72 hours, with an increase in the percentage of cells in the G0-G1 phases, compared with mock
transfection, of ∼10% and ∼20%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6A), which correlated with p27Kip1 levels (Fig. 4B,
compare the p27Kip1 band in mock-transfected, pre-miR181a–transfected, and pre-miR-630–transfected A549 cells
not exposed to CDDP). Whereas pre-miR-181–transfected
cells remained fully responsive to the late S-G2-M cell cycle
blockage induced by CDDP, pre-miR-630 transfection strongly reduced both the G2-M and the S components of the arrest
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). Intriguingly, whereas CDDP led to
a minor yet detectable decrease in the abundance of p27Kip1
in pre-miR-181a–transfected cells (correlating with the late
S-G2-M cell cycle blockage), p27Kip1 was further upregulated
by CDDP on pre-miR-630 transfection (which correlated with
a less pronounced decrease in the % of cells in G0-G1). Thus,
whereas CDDP-treated cells fail to enter/complete mitosis
due to the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint (and
hence accumulate in the S and G2-M phases of the cell cycle),
pre-miR-181a and pre-miR-630 induce a qualitatively and
quantitatively distinct response, consisting in a slight G0-G1
cell cycle blockage that is (at least partially) sustained by
p27Kip1. We then tested growth rates by colorimetric assays.
Pre-miR-630 conferred a proliferative disadvantage to A549
cells, which manifested as early as 24 hours after transfection
(Supplementary Fig. S6B). Altogether, these results suggest
that pre-miR-630–transfected cells are hindered from progressing through the cell cycle by upregulated p27 Kip1, thereby becoming less sensitive to CDDP.
miR-630–mediated inhibition of the DNA damage
response. Driven by the observation that miR-630 affects
the proapoptotic activation of p53, we monitored hallmarks
of the DNA damage response (by immunofluorescence microscopy) during the first 9 hours of CDDP administration,
when cells still lacked any morphologic/biochemical signs
of apoptosis. By using phosphoneoepitope-specific antibodies,
we assessed the phosphorylation (on Ser139) of γ-H2AX,
which forms typical nuclear foci in response to DNA damage (39). Moreover, we determined the activating phosphorylation (on Ser1981) of the DNA damage–sensing kinase
ATM, which relocates to DNA damage foci and phosphorylates p53 on Ser15 (Fig. 5A and B; refs. 38, 40). Untreated
cells, either mock transfected or transfected for 48 hours
with pre-miRNAs, failed to display signs of DNA damage
(Fig. 5C and D). In contrast, as early as 3 hours after the
administration of a proapoptotic dose of CDDP (50 μmol/L),
a sizeable fraction (∼40%) of mock-transfected A549 cells
displayed γ-H2AX aggregation and ATM activation, and this
percentage progressively increased up to ∼80% (at 9 hours;
Fig. 5C and D). Whereas pre-miR-181a failed to modulate
γ-H2AX foci induced by CDDP, pre-miR-630 reduced the
fraction of γ-H2AX+ cells to about half of that recorded in
mock-transfected cells. Similarly, the activation of ATM triggered by CDDP was not modified by pre-miR-181a yet attenuated by pre-miR-630 (Fig. 5C and D). These data correlate
with the results from immunoblotting assessments about the
activation of p53 at a later time point (24 hours), altogether

suggesting that miR-630 inhibits p53 activation by limiting
the early DNA damage response.
Concluding remarks. As shown here, a specific panel of
miRNAs is upregulated by NSCLC cells in response to CDDP,
and some of these miRNAs also strongly modulate this cytotoxic response. Thus, miR-181a sensitized A549 cells to the
lethal action of CDDP (as well as to that of carboplatin
and oxaliplatin) by stimulating Bax oligomerization and the
activation of proapoptotic caspases. Conversely, miR-630
conferred robust cytoprotection against CDDP and carboplatin, (at least partially) resulting from decreased proliferation
coupled to upstream inhibition of the signaling cascades that
emanate from damaged DNA and converge on p53 activation. A summary of the effects of miR-181a and miR-630 on

untreated and CDDP-treated A549 cells can be found in Supplementary Table S4. Apparently at odds with previous reports (11), transfection-enforced upregulation of miR-181a
neither did affect the proliferation rates of A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B) nor did it cause obvious apoptosis in
A549, HeLa, and HCT116 cells (Fig. 2D; Supplementary
Fig. S2). However, pre-miR-181a enhanced the lethality of
various chemotherapeutic agents and nonspecific cell death
inducers in several NSCLC cell lines (Fig. 3; Supplementary
Figs. S3 and S4), lending further support to the hypothesis
that miR-181a may indeed represent a bona fide tumor suppressor (11). Recently, miRNA profiling of A549 cells subjected to γ-ray–mediated DNA damage allowed for the
identification of 22 miRNAs differentially modulated by low

and high radiation intensities, which, however, included neither miR-181a nor miR-630 (41). Contrarily to miR-181a,
which was upregulated by CDDP but not by C2-CER and
CdCl2, miR-630 levels were increased in a relatively nonspecific fashion. Still, miR-630 failed to protect (and rather
tended to sensitize) A549 cells from the cytotoxic effects of
C2-CER, CdCl2, etoposide, mitoxantrone, and oxaliplatin,
thereby behaving in this respect as a rather specific cell death
modulator. Thus, our results suggest that miR-630 inhibits
p53-regulated proapoptotic signaling pathways that are specifically ignited by CDDP and carboplatin (but not by oxaliplatin). CDDP and oxaliplatin are indeed known to elicit
distinct cellular damage responses (42). The observation that
anti-miR-181a and anti-miR-630 per se failed to modulate
CDDP-induced cell death (Fig. 4A) suggests that these
miRNAs are not strictly required for CDDP-elicited signaling
pathways, although, as shown above, they do indeed regulate
these responses. The miRanda algorithm 13 (43) predicts
3,650 and 2,418 targets for miR-181a and miR-630, respectively, strongly suggesting that their functional effects on
CDDP-induced cell death are mediated by more than one
single (or a few) targets. For instance, miR-181a is predicted
to downregulate several proteins whose depletion may
sensitize to CDDP-induced cell death, including the essential
autophagic modulator ATG5 and several members of the

13

mitogen-associated protein kinase family. As in mammals
miRNA-dependent gene regulation mostly occurs at the
translational level (5), only large-scale proteomic studies will
be able to clarify the contribution of each target of miR-181a
and miR-630 to their cell death modulatory role. In the future, it will be interesting to determine whether miR-181a
and miR-630 are upregulated in vivo and in NSCLC patients
treated with CDDP, as well as whether miR-181a and miR630 expression levels correlate with (and possibly predict)
the chemotherapeutic response.
