ABSTRACT:
Background: Bevacizumab and temsirolimus are active agents in gynecologic
tumors. Temsirolimus attenuates upregulation of HIF-1α levels, a resistance
mechanism for antiangiogenics, and targets the PI3-kinase/AKT/mTOR axis,
commonly aberrant in these tumors
Patients and Methods: We analyzed safety and responses in 41 patients
with gynecologic cancers treated as part of a Phase I study of bevacizumab and
temsirolimus.
Results: Median age of the 41 women was 60 years (range, 33-80 years); median
number of prior systemic therapies was 4 (1-11). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related
toxicities included: thrombocytopenia (10%), mucositis (2%), hypertension (2%),
hypercholesterolemia (2%), fatigue (7%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (2%),
and neutropenia (2%). Twenty-nine patients (71%) experienced no treatment-related
toxicity greater than grade 2. Full FDA-approved doses of both drugs (bevacizumab
15mg/kg IV Q3weeks and temsirolimus 25mg IV weekly) were administered without
dose-limiting toxicity. Eight patients (20%) achieved stable disease (SD) ≥ 6 months
and 7 patients (17%), a partial response (PR) [total = 15/41 patients (37%)]. Eight
of 13 patients (62%) with high-grade serous histology (ovarian or primary peritoneal)
achieved SD ≥ 6 months/PR.
Conclusion: Bevacizumab and temsirolimus was well tolerated. Thirty-seven
percent of heavily-pretreated patients achieved SD ≥ 6 months/PR, suggesting that
this combination warrants further study.

INTRODUCTION

Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody specific for VEGF
and prevents VEGF from interacting with its receptors on
the surface of endothelial cells [6]. Bevacizumab inhibits
angiogenesis, reducing tumor microvascularity and
abrogating metastatic disease progression [6-8].
Diverse receptors in interconnected signaling
pathways communicate with each other through cross-talk
[9, 10]. Because communication is not restricted to a single
receptor or signaling pathway, tumors frequently become

Angiogenesis plays a key role in the pathogenesis
of metastases, as new vessels provide growing tumors
with nutrients, growth factors, oxygen, proteolytic
enzymes, hemolytic factors, and hormones [1-3]. The
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of
proteins and receptors is important in tumor angiogenesis
and fundamental for tumor growth and metastasis [4, 5].

resistant to antiangiogenic therapy through mechanisms
such as upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1
α [3, 7, 11-21]. Adaptive responses to hypoxic conditions
are modulated through HIF-1α over-expression, increasing
levels of VEGF, which results in aggressive tumor growth
and poor patient outcomes [3, 7, 11-21].
Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase involved in
initiating messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) translation
[22, 23]. Aberrations of the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway are common in several
gynecologic malignancies such as endometrial and
ovarian cancer [24, 25]. Renal cell carcinoma cell lines
demonstrated inhibition of mTOR activity in in vitro
studies with temsirolimus, as well as reduced levels
of HIF-1α, HIF-2α and VEGF [21]. Temsirolimus also
inhibited VEGF production in vitro under both normoxic
and hypoxic conditions through inhibition of HIF-1
expression and transcriptional activation in the human
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 gene amplified
breast cancer cell line BT474 [26].
Taken together, there are several compelling
rationales for combining bevacizumab and temsirolimus
in gynecologic tumors: i) temsirolimus inhibits mTOR and
the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway is critical in several
gynecologic malignancies [24, 25]; ii) temsirolimus
attenuates upregulation of HIF-1α levels, which may be
a resistance mechanism for bevacizumab [21, 26]; iii)
single-agent activity with temsirolimus and bevacizumab
have been demonstrated in gynecologic cancers [27, 28];
and, iv) the two agents have non-overlapping toxicities.
Here we report our experience treating patients with
gynecologic malignancies with this combination therapy.

Forty-one women with advanced, metastatic ovarian,
uterine and cervical malignancies were enrolled starting in
April 2008. Demographic and clinical characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. The median age of patients was 60
years (range, 33-80 years). The most common cancer sites
were ovarian followed by uterine. The median number of
prior systemic therapies was 4 (range, 1-11). All patients
had experienced disease progression on their prior therapy.
No patients had received prior mTOR inhibitor therapy.
Fourteen of forty-one patients (34%) had received prior
therapy with bevacizumab. The median number of cycles
(cycle = 21 days) completed for all patients was 4 (range,
1-25+). Thirty-four patients (83%) received more than 2
cycles. For patients with SD or better, the median number
of cycles completed was 12 (range, 6-25+). At the time of
analysis, three patients were continuing on therapy.

Patients were enrolled in accordance with the
planned 3+3 study design until dose level 11 (Table 2), at
which point an expansion cohort for response (as described
in the Methods section) was initiated. Dose escalation for
the remaining two levels continued in accordance with the
original dose escalation plan. Dose level 13 (bevacizumab
15 mg/kg and temsirolimus 25 mg) was reached and no
MTD was obtained as we were able to reach the highest
FDA-approved doses of both drugs (29).
All 41 patients with an advanced gynecologic
malignancy experienced at least one adverse event that
was possibly drug related. These events were mostly
grade 1 or grade 2 and reversible. In fact, 29 patients
(71%) experienced no treatment-related toxicity greater
than grade 2. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were as follows:
thrombocytopenia (10%), mucositis (2%), hypertension
(2%), hypercholesterolemia (2%), fatigue (7%), elevated
aspartate aminotransferase (2%), and decreased absolute
neutrophil count/leucopenia (2%). Among this subset of
patients, two DLTs occurred (grade 3 hypertension at dose
level 3 (bevacizumab 15 mg/kg and temsirolimus 5 mg)
and grade 3 fatigue at dose level 13 (bevacizumab 15 mg/
kg and temsirolimus 25 mg)) (Table 2). These toxicities
were reversible when the dose was lowered or held. Of
the 25 patients treated at the MTD, only 3/25 (12%) were
dose-reduced for toxicities occurring during the first
cycle. In these three instances, the temsirolimus was dose
reduced from 25 to 20 mg. The causes of dose reduction
were grade 3 fatigue (n=1), grade 2 mucositis (n=1) and

There were no gastrointestinal perforations,
thromboembolic events or cases of significant proteinuria.
Two patients experienced gastrointestinal-vaginal fistula.
One patient had vaginal cancer (adenocarcinoma) and
had received prior pelvic radiation. She had a history of
gastrointestinal-vaginal fistula prior to protocol entry and
had been surgically diverted with colostomy. While on
therapy, she developed worsening vaginal discharge and
perineal pain. Though there was no radiographic evidence
on computed-tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen/
pelvis of fistula, clinically she was believed to have
gastrointestinal-vaginal fistula (grade 2). She completed
only one cycle of therapy before withdrawing consent.
The second patient had low grade serous ovarian cancer
with no prior history of pelvic radiation. She was found
on CT of the abdomen and pelvis to have gastrointestinalvaginal fistula (grade 1). She was taken off protocol for
fistula formation and received only one cycle of therapy.
Finally there was one patient who developed wound
healing complications. This patient had cervical cancer
(squamous cell) and a history of prior radiation. She had
undergone vaginoplasty with subsequent development
of recto-vaginal fistula and necrotic tumor in the vagina.
Her vaginal mass decreased in size by 28% per RECIST
on the first restaging but her course was complicated by
persistent perirectal abscess treated with oral antibiotics.

The abscess remained stable during her three cycle of
treatment; however, the patient was taken off protocol as
she wished to pursue elective colostomy.

Antitumor Activity
Thirty-four of the 41 patients had disease that
was measurable by RECIST and reached restaging. All
patients, however, were considered evaluable. Figure 1 is
a waterfall plot depicting best response by patient. Five
patients were assigned an arbitrary value of +21% for
early clinical progression or new lesions upon restaging.
The remaining two patients were assigned a value of +1%
as they were evaluable but not measurable by RECIST and
had SD. Seven patients (17%) achieved a partial response
(PR). SD lasting ≥ 6 months was observed in 8 patients
(20%). The total SD ≥ 6 months/PR rate was 15/41
patients (37%). Details regarding these patients including
dose level, duration of treatment and best response by
RECIST are described in Table 4.
The only patient with clear cell carcinoma of the
uterus achieved a PR. Of 11 patients with cancer arising
from the uterus, four (36%) had SD ≥ 6 months or a PR
(these included 3/9 patients with epithelial uterine cancer
and 1/1 patient with clear cell carcinoma). Among 11
patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, three

When archival cell blocks for patients were
available, CLIA-certified testing was performed for BRAF,
NRAS, KRAS, and PI3 kinase mutations along with
evaluation for PTEN loss. PI3 kinase mutational status
was known for 25/41 of patients (61%) and was positive
in one (45%). This patient achieved a PR. PTEN status
was known for 2/41 (5%), and PTEN loss was identified
in none of the patients tested. For BRAF, mutational status
was evaluated in 15/41 (37%) and was positive in none
of the patients tested. Finally, KRAS/NRAS mutations
were evaluated in 17/41 of the patients (41%). One patient
(6%) had an NRAS mutation and 1 (6%) patient had a
KRAS mutation. Neither of these patients achieved SD ≥
6 months or a PR (Table 3). Among the 15 patients with a

attributed to temsirolimus. These toxicities were reversible
with discontinuation of treatment or lowering of the dose,
and were mostly managed with supportive care while
patients were on therapy. Further, we had no complications
of gastrointestinal perforation, significant proteinuria or
thromboembolic events. One patient developed a new
gastro-vaginal fistula on therapy. One patient with wound
healing complications from prior vaginoplasty and locally
advanced necrotic vaginal tumor, had shrinkage of her
vaginal tumor (-28%) at first restaging and was taken
off study because she wished to proceed with elective
colostomy.
Moroney et al [39] recently reported a SD ≥ 6
months/PR/CR rate of 38% in patients with advanced
gynecologic and breast malignancy treated with liposomal
doxorubicin, bevacizumab and temsirolimus. Our SD ≥
6 months/PR rate was 37% which is comparable without
the added toxicity of liposomal doxorubicin. Our patients,
like those reported by Moroney et al [39], were heavily
pretreated with a median of four prior systemic therapies.

DISCUSSION
There is a paucity of definitive data regarding
optimal therapy in patients with advanced gynecologic
malignancies after failure of first-line agents. Many of
these patients are heavily pretreated, and thus less likely to
tolerate full-dose cytotoxic therapy. In our study, treatment
with bevacizumab and temsirolimus showed excellent
tolerance even when the maximum FDA-approved dose
of each drug was used in the combination. Twenty-nine
patients (71%) experienced no treatment-related toxicity
greater than grade 2 and only two DLTs were observed.
A minority of patients (n=12) experienced grade 3 or 4
toxicities, most of which were cytopenias, dyslipidemia,
elevated liver function tests (AST) or fatigue, and

However, 51/74 patients (69%) of the patients treated by
Moroney et al [39] experienced any tumor regression,
while only 18/41 patients (44%) of our patients did. Only
a randomized study would be able to answer the question
as to whether or not liposomal doxorubicin adds activity
to the bevacizumab and temsirolimus regimen.
Mutations in PI3 kinase result in activation of
the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and are present
in various tumor types [40, 41]. In gynecologic
malignancies, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha
polypeptide (PIK3CA) mutations are found in 23%, 10%
and 12% of endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancers,
respectively[42]. PTEN typically acts as a repressor of
the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and its loss results
in its constitutive activation [43]. PTEN mutations are
found in 40%, 4%, and 5% of endometrial, ovarian,
and cervical cancers, respectively [42]. We previously
reported a PR rate of 35% in heavily pretreated patients
with diverse cancers and somatic PI3 kinase mutations
treated with PI3kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors
[44]. In addition, Janku and colleagues [45] also showed
a PR rate of 30% in patients with breast and gynecologic
malignancies harboring PIK3CA mutations and treated
with relevant pathway inhibitors. The relationship between
mutational status and response in our patients is unclear
because of the limited numbers of patients with tissue
available for testing. Twenty-five of 41 patients (61%)
were analyzed for PIK3CA mutation and only one was
positive. This patient achieved a PR. Of the 24 patients
who were negative for PIK3CA mutation, 9 patients (38%)
achieved SD ≥ 6 months/PR. Further, of the 15 patients
who achieved SD ≥ 6 months/PR, only 10 had a known
PIK3CA mutation status. While these results suggest
that PIK3CA mutations are not necessary to achieve
SD ≥ 6 months/PR, there are several limitations to this
observation. For example, our laboratory only evaluated
exons 9 and 20 at the time of patient testing. These exons
code only for the helical and kinase functional domains
of PIK3CA, respectively. Mutations in the p85 binding
site, RAS binding site and C2 region were not assessed
so that other PI3 kinase mutations may have been missed.
Further, aberrations in mTOR and AKT, though known
to exist in cancer [46-48], were not assessed. Finally,
PTEN loss and/or mutation are common in endometrial
cancers [49] and merit more extensive evaluation.
Unfortunately, limited tissue availability resulted in PTEN
IHC testing being evaluated in only a small number of
our patients. Of interest in this regard, Moroney et al
[39] demonstrated that 13 of 25 patients (52%) with
gynecologic malignancies that had PIK3CA mutations or
PTEN loss and were treated with liposomal doxorubicin,
bevacizumab, and temsirolimus achieved SD ≥ 6 months/
PR/CR. Further, the combination of bevacizumab and
temsirolimus has shown preliminary evidence of activity
in other tumors in which activation of the PI3 kinase/
AKT/mTOR axis has been implicated, including salivary
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

duct tumors [50] and lymphangioleiomyomatosis [51].
Other mechanisms for response could be
operative in our patients. For example, bevacizumab
has antiangiogenic properties, and resistance to this
agent is caused in part by upregulation of HIF-1α [3, 7,
11-21]. Further, temsirolimus abrogates HIF-1α mRNA
transcription and this may drive response in some patients
[26].
There are several limitations to this study. First,
molecular analysis could not be performed in many
of the patients because of lack of tissue and therefore a
biomarker was not elucidated. Second, these patients were
heavily pretreated, with a median of four prior systemic
therapies, and this may have limited response signals.
Third, patients were treated on a variety of dose levels.
However, in relation to the latter point, it should be noted
that there was no obvious dose-response relationship,
with SD≥6 months/PR attained even at dose levels 1 and
2, and no difference in rate of SD≥6 months/PR in patients
treated at the highest dose level (9 of 25 patients (36%))
versus those treated at lower dose levels (6 of 16 (38%)) (p
= 1). However, the study was not designed to answer the
dose-response question in a definitive manner.
In conclusion, the combination of bevacizumab
and temsirolimus was well tolerated in our study and has
demonstrated clinical activity in patients with advanced
gynecologic malignancy having undergone extensive
prior therapy. The overall rate of SD ≥ 6 months/PR was
37%, and 8 of 13 patients (62%) with high-grade serous
histology (ovarian or primary peritoneal) achieved SD ≥
6 months/PR. Further study of this combination in larger
populations with gynecologic cancers is warranted.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Dosing
The experience with gynecologic malignancies
reported is part of a single institution, phase I, open-label,
dose-escalation study. This trial was open to all patients
with advanced or metastatic cancer refractory to standard
therapy, relapsed after standard therapy, or who had no
standard therapy available that improves survival by at
least three months. (The trial successfully completed dose
escalation to the highest specified dose level, that is dose
level 13, which consisted of the highest FDA-approved
doses of both drugs (bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 3
weeks and temsirolimus 25 mg IV weekly)[29].)
Treatment was administered on an outpatient basis
at MD Anderson Cancer Center. A cycle of therapy was 21
days. No investigational or commercial agents or therapies
other than those described here could be administered with
the intent to treat the patient’s malignancy. Bevacizumab
was given on day 1 only of each cycle while temsirolimus

Assessment of Tumor Response

was given weekly on days 1, 8 and 15 (Table 2). Restaging
scans were performed after every two cycles. Consent
was obtained and patients were treated in accordance with
MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board
guidelines.
The protocol followed a standard 3+3 design. If
one patient in a cohort experienced a DLT during the first
cycle, three additional patients were enrolled and treated
at that dose level. If at any time more than 33% of patients
in a cohort experienced a DLT, that cohort was closed to
additional patients. Adverse events were graded based on
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
version 3.0 (CTCAEv3.0) [30]. DLTs were defined as
any grade three or four non-hematologic toxicity that was
possibly, probably or definitely related to any of the study
medications, with the following exceptions: a) any grade
four hematologic toxicity lasting less than two weeks, and
b) any grade four nausea or vomiting lasting less than five
days. DLTs had to occur within the first cycle of treatment.
Of note, early in the trial multiple significant responses
were observed. If a response was observed in a particular
tumor type with the study drug combination, expanded
enrollment was permitted for up to a total of 14 patients
with that tumor type at the highest dose level deemed safe
at the time of patient enrollment. All enrolled participants
with that tumor type were considered in the DLT analysis.
For the purpose of dose expansion, a tumor response was
defined as one or more of the following: 1) stable disease
for more than or equal to four months (SD ≥ 4 months), 2)
decrease in the sum of target lesions by more than or equal
to 20% by RECIST criteria 1.0, or 3) decrease in tumor
markers by more than or equal to 25%. This resulted in
cohort expansions in gynecologic malignancies.

Tumor measurements were performed on patients
with measurable disease pre-treatment and every two
cycles thereafter. Measurable target lesions were evaluated
for response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST 1.0) [31, 32]. For purposes of this report,
prolonged stable disease (SD) was defined as lasting ≥ 6
months.

Molecular Analysis (PIK3CA, BRAF, NRAS and
KRAS, BRAF and PTEN)
PIK3CA, BRAF, NRAS and KRAS mutations were
investigated in archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks. DNA was extracted from microdissected
paraffin-embedded tumor sections and analyzed using a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA sequencing
method for PIK3CA mutations in codons [c]532-554
of exon 9 (helical domain) and c1011-1062 of exon 20
(kinase domain)[33], which included the mutation hot
spot region of the PIK3CA proto-oncogene by Sanger
sequencing following amplification of 276 bp and 198
bp amplicons, respectively. Codons 12, 13, and 61 were
examined for KRAS and NRAS mutations and for BRAF,
codons 468-474, codons 595-600, and mutations of exon
15 by pyro-sequencing were examined as previously
described [34]. PTEN loss by IHC generally indicates
aberrant or mutated PTEN, which serves to activate the
PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway [35-38]. Formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded sections (5 µm thick) from biopsy
or resection specimens were used for IHC analysis. The
sections were stained with antibody to PTEN (Dako,
Carpinteria, CA). All histologies were centrally reviewed
and all testing was performed in the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendment (CLIA) –certified Molecular
Diagnostic Laboratory (MDL) at MD Anderson.

Eligibility Criteria
Key inclusion criteria were histologicallydocumented, advanced or metastatic solid tumors
refractory to standard treatment or for which no standard
therapy was available; Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ two; absolute
neutrophil count ≥ 1 x 109/L; platelet count ≥ 50.0 x 109/L;
serum creatinine < 3.0 mg/dL, alanine transferase (ALT) ≤
five times the upper limit of normal (ULN); bilirubin ≤ 3.0
mg/dL, total cholesterol < 350 mg/dL; and, triglyceride
<400 mg/dL. Key exclusion criteria were clinically
significant, unexplained bleeding or hemoptysis within 28
days prior to study entry; poorly controlled hypertension
(systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic pressure
≥ 90 mm Hg); patients with clinically significant
cardiovascular disease; and, pregnancy. Prior exposure to
mTOR and VEGF-inhibitors were not exclusion criteria
for study entry, nor were patients with a history of venous
thromboembolism excluded.
