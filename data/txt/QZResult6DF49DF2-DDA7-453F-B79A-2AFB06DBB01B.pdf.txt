BACKGROUND. The authors analyzed how self-reported health and self-reported
modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac function scores were
related to cardiac systolic function, cardiac risk factors, and cancer treatment history in childhood cancer survivors who reported no symptoms of cardiac disease.

METHODS. Long-term survivors of pediatric cancer who were treated between
1971 and 1995 (current ages, 16–39.7 years) underwent noninvasive clinical and

Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey. Results were compared with survivor history of anthracycline therapy alone or with radiotherapy
apy (n 5 32 patients; mean, 11 years after diagnosis).
RESULTS. Sex, current age, highest school grade completed, race, age at diagnosis,
diagnostic group, years off therapy, fractional shortening (FS), heart rate, and
smoking status were found to be independently predictive of self-reported health.
Interaction between female sex and higher low-density lipoprotein values and
between diagnosis and abnormal FS variably predicted low reported vitality and
low reported modified New York Heart Association (NYHA) scores. Echocardiographic findings, cardiac risk factors, and treatment history explained 13% to
28% of the variance in perceived health and self-reported modified NYHA scores.
CONCLUSIONS. Systolic function and cardiac risk factors were linked to lower selfreported health and NYHA scores even in the absence of clinically evident cardiotoxicity. Cancer 2008;112:1835–44.  2008 American Cancer Society.

Anthracycline-induced myocardial damage is dose-dependent,
largely irreversible,6 and associated with cumulative and peak dose

RT and anthracyclines are cardiotoxic synergistically.14,15 Patient factors can increase cardiotoxicity risk; womens’ myocardial cells retain
higher concentrations of anthracyclines, which are poorly absorbed
by body fat9,16; patients with trisomy 21 have greater risk of cardiotoxicity9,17; younger age at the start of chemotherapy predicts afterload increase7; in addition to a pre-existing 2-fold to 3-fold excess

strated that black race (relative risk, 1.7) contributes
to the relative risk of developing early cardiotoxicity
after anthracycline treatment.21
Cardiovascular complications may impair childhood cancer survivors’ perceived physical health.12,22,23
We examined self-reported general health, vitality, and
physical function and self-reported cardiac symptoms
that corresponded to the New York Heart Association
(NYHA) cardiac classification in childhood cancer survivors; we compared those findings with the results
from noninvasive assessment of cardiac systolic function, cancer treatment history, and self-reported cardiac risk factors. The focus of this study was the
measurement of systolic function in childhood cancer
survivors who reported no symptoms of cardiac disease. Whereas previous studies have compared selfreported health status in survivors versus a healthy
control group22,24,25; in the current study, we compared self-reported health in survivors who received
anthracycline therapy alone (N 5 86), versus anthracycline plus RT (N 5 41), versus survivors who received
neither anthracyclines nor RT (N 5 32).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Participants were childhood cancer survivors attending a long-term follow-up clinic who reported no
symptoms of cardiac disease; they were categorized
as ‘‘exposed’’ or ‘‘unexposed’’ based on whether or
not they received treatment with potentially cardiotoxic modalities (anthracycline or chest RT). The
sample size (N 5 278; 223 exposed, 55 not exposed)
was calculated to provide 99% power to detect a 15%
change in fractional shortening (FS) and allow a 10%
rate of missing data. Exclusion criteria included 1)
congenital heart disease, 2) chronic systemic illness,
3) trisomy 21, and 4) anemia (hematocrit <28%). Eligible survivors who were seen consecutively for follow-up were invited to participate.26 A subset of
survivors aged 16 years (127 exposed, 32 not
exposed) responded to the health subscales of the
Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health
Survey (SF-36), which had not been validated for use
in younger children. Because only 6 patients had
received RT alone, they were not included in the
analyses. Our Institutional Review Board approved
the study. All participants or their parents provided
written informed consent.
Study Assessments
Cardiac assessment
Clinical assessments documented signs of heart failure and NYHA score.27 A 12-lead electrocardiogram

and echocardiogram were performed within 24 hours
of the clinical assessment. Echocardiograms comprised
complete, 2-dimensional, M-mode, and Doppler evaluation with stress-velocity analysis.28 All electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data were interpreted
by a single cardiologist who was blinded to risk and
treatment history. FS (<0.28 5 abnormal) was used as
a measure of overall left ventricular systolic performance; it was not age-adjusted, because it is not
affected by age within the age range of this study.29
Afterload (>74 g/cm2 5 abnormal) was approximated
by left ventricular end-systolic wall stress.30

Perceived physical health
Subscales of the SF-3631 measured physical health
(a 5 .93), general health (a 5 .80), and vitality
(a 5 .88). A modified 6-point self-report Likert scale
(a 5 .80) that is used routinely at Stanford’s Pediatric
Cardiology Clinic and an expansion of the NYHA cardiac function classification27 rated survivors’ fatigue,
palpitations, and chest pain in the context of running, walking, climbing stairs, and sports/band/work.
A score of 0 on the activity corresponded to the
NYHA classification ‘‘unable to perform the physical
activity without discomfort’’; and a score of 5 corresponded to ‘‘activity does not cause undue fatigue,
palpitation. or dyspnea.’’
Laboratory assessments included triglycerides,
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and
low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and hematocrit. We
defined normal LDL as <100mg/dL, in keeping with
recent studies; the more stringent cutoff is recommended for high-risk populations of children and
young adults.32,33 The mean age of our survivors was
>20 years. Body surface area (BSA) was calculated as
(W0.425 3 H0.725) 3 0.007184, where W is the weight
in kilograms and H is the height in centimeters; BSA
was categorized as low (<1.62 m2), normal (1.62–
1.99 m2), or high (2–2.90 m2) according to recent
recommendations.34 Values for left ventricular end
diastolic dimension (LVEDd) and left ventricular end
systolic dimension (LVESd) were divided by the cube
root of the BSA. Survivors indicated their smoking
status as current smoker, past smoker, or never
smoked. Because of the distribution of responses,
current and past smokers were combined as the
‘‘ever smoked’’ category.
Statistical Analysis
Normative data for healthy individuals who were not
treated for cancer were used to define normal and
abnormal ranges for echocardiogram findings.29,35–39
We used a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to
compare treatment history, cardiac risk factors, and

Subclinical Cardiotoxicity and Health/Cox et al.

echocardiographic findings across the treatment
groups. We conducted general linear model univariate analyses with highest school grade completed (a
proxy for socioeconomic status, because household
income data were incomplete) and years off therapy
as covariates, and we used diagnostic group and sex
as fixed factors to identify predictors of physical
health, vitality, general health, and the modified
NYHA score. Variables that yielded P < .10 were
included in the multivariate analysis. Final models
included only significant variables from the multivariate analysis, which was adjusted for potential multicollinearity; exceptions were interaction effects
discovered in the course of the multivariate analyses.
For multiple comparisons, we used the Bonferroni
adjustment for a.

RESULTS
Survivors in the anthracycline plus RT group had
diagnoses of predominantly leukemia/lymphoma
(Table 1). Compared with the unexposed group, this
group was significantly older at diagnosis (P 5 .011)
and at follow-up (P 5 .041) and was more recently
off therapy (P 5 .027) in post-hoc ANOVA tests.
The groups did not differ in terms of cardiac risk
factors (Table 2). The anthracycline plus RT group
had clinically insignificant, smaller LVEDd (P 5 .038)
than the anthracycline only group (46.89 mm vs
49.35 mm), but neither exposed group alone differed
significantly from the unexposed group (48.45 mm)
in ANOVA post hoc comparisons. Compared with the
unexposed group (P 5 .042), the combined exposed
groups had larger proportions of survivors with
increased chamber size (LVEDd; consistent with early
stages of heart failure) (Table 2). Although no differences were observed between the treatment groups
on estimated afterload in the categorical analyses
(Table 2), ANOVA post hoc comparisons revealed a
15.11 g/cm2 difference (P 5 .002) between the
anthracycline only group and the unexposed group
and a 12.15 g/cm2 difference (P 5 .045) between the
anthracycline plus RT group and the unexposed
group, suggesting a modest impact of anthracyclines
and RT on estimated afterload without synergy
between these treatments. Several statistically nonsignificant findings were noteworthy: A greater proportion of patients in the anthracycline plus RT
group had abnormally high LDL, both of the exposed
groups had higher triglyceride levels compared with
the unexposed group, a greater proportion of the
exposed groups were current or past smokers, and a
greater proportion of survivors in the unexposed
group had an abnormally high BSA.

1837

The treatment groups did not differ in selfreported modified NYHA scores or in perceived
health (Table 1). We compared the perceived general
health, physical health, and vitality scores of the
treatment groups with normative values for the 2 age
groups (ages 18–24 years and 25–34 years) that
encompassed 62% of the sample. Although all groups
had subnormal physical health scores, only the
exposed groups differed significantly from the norm
(P  .001). General health scores were lower than the
norm in the exposed groups and were higher than
the norm in the unexposed group, but the difference
was not significant. Both the combined exposed
groups (P 5 .017) and the unexposed group
(P 5 .013) had vitality scores that were significantly
higher than the norm.
Because the exposed and unexposed groups did
not differ in terms of perceived health outcomes and
modified NYHA scores, we analyzed how patient
characteristics, treatment, cardiac risk, and systolic
function were related to these scores in the study
group overall (Tables 3 and 4). Lower clinically
assessed resting heart rate (CRHR) predicted higher
modified NYHA score (Table 3). Abnormal FS interacted with the solid tumor group to predict low perceived vitality (P 5 .002). Diastolic and systolic blood
pressure, hematocrit, afterload, LVEDd, and LVESd
were not significant predictors of perceived health or
of self-reported NYHA functional classification in the
univariate analyses and were not analyzed further.
White race predicted greater self-reported general health (P 5 .036) and a higher NYHA score
(P 5 .047) (Table 4). A significant interaction between
male sex, solid tumor diagnosis, and black race predicted a lower NYHA score (P 5 .014) and lower perceived physical health (P 5 .011). Younger age at
diagnosis predicted a higher NYHA score (P 5 .005)
and greater perceived physical health (P 5 .040).
Female sex, leukemia/lymphoma diagnosis, and
younger age at diagnosis interacted to predict greater
perceived health (P 5 .014). Female sex interacted
with higher (abnormal) LDL to predict a lower NYHA
score (P 5 .015). Male sex, leukemia/lymphoma diagnosis, and never having smoked interacted to predict
a higher NYHA score (P 5 .021), greater perceived
general health (P 5 .040), and vitality (P 5 .022).
Anthracycline cumulative dose, triglycerides, HDL,
BSA, and hematocrit were not significant predictors
of NYHA score or perceived health subscale scores in
the univariate analyses.
Variables that were statistically controlled in the
univariate analyses (diagnosis, years off therapy, sex,
and highest school grade completed) and CRHR
were entered first into the multivariate regression

DISCUSSION
In the current study among survivors of childhood
cancer, 3 treatment groups, including 2 groups that
had been exposed to treatment with potentially cardiotoxic modalities and 1 unexposed group, did not
differ in terms of cardiac symptoms or cardiac risk
factors. However, we observed significant differences
between treatment groups in the echocardiographic
findings (categorical and continuous) consistent with
subclinical anthracycline-induced systolic dysfunction. These findings suggest early, asymptomatic cardiotoxicity in the anthracycline-treated groups
despite their normal clinical assessment.

Treatment group was not associated directly with
perceived health or modified self-report NYHA
scores, possibly because of the young age of the
sample. Patient-discernible symptoms of cardiotoxicity may not affect health perceptions significantly
until the patient is older.22 All groups, however,
reported lower physical health than the age-adjusted
general population, and the difference was most
striking in the at-risk group.
Abnormal FS (consistent with anthracyclineassociated heart failure), alone and in interaction
with a solid tumor diagnosis (exposure to higher cumulative doses of anthracycline), resulted in perceptions of poorer vitality and lower NYHA scores. Men
who were older at diagnosis and who had abnormal
FS reported poorer general health. Higher resting
heart rate (a reflection of early heart failure) predicted a lower NYHA score and perceptions of lower
general health in the multivariate analyses. Currently,
all guidelines for assessment of left ventricular function are based on clinical findings.40 However, the
absence of overt symptoms and signs of incipient
left ventricular failure does not suggest the absence
of risk or alter survivors’ perceived health.41 Our
findings suggest that survivors’ perceptions may
reflect cardiotoxicity long before there is clear clinical
evidence.
Although women had higher NYHA scores and
greater perceived health42,43 than men in the sample,
women with higher heart rates reported perceptions
of lower physical health and vitality. Female sex in

interaction with abnormally high LDL32,33 was associated significantly with a lower NYHA score.
Although the difference was not statistically significant, triglycerides were higher in both of the exposed
groups than in the unexposed group. Anthracyclines
not only directly affect the myocardium but also
interfere with fatty acid metabolism, which may
increase posttherapy triglycerides and LDL.44 It has
been established that anthracyclines cause endothelial injury in pediatric cancer patients, but the sexspecific impact is unknown.45 The smaller size of
vessels and myocardium in young women, together
with endothelial injury, may account for the perception of lower perceived health among women survivors who are at risk. Although the finding was not
statistically significant, abnormally high LDL was
more frequent in the anthracycline plus RT group
than in the other treatment group. The extent to

which this finding may reflect a cumulative effect
between endothelial injury, the established synergism
between RT and anthracycline in cardiotoxicity,14,15
and alteration of fatty acid metabolism remains to be
explored.
White race significantly predicted a higher
NYHA score; black race and a diagnosis of solid tumor predicted the lowest perceived general health
scores. When it was controlled statistically, more
education predicted higher NYHA and vitality scores.
Survivors with more education and a diagnosis of
leukemia/lymphoma were more likely to report
decreased vitality. The extent to which these variables reflect the impact of socioeconomic status
and/or significant surgical intervention in patients
with solid tumors on perceived health could not be
determined in the current study and should be
explored in future studies.

The least amount of variance (adjusted R2 5
13%) was explained in physical health. In addition to
endurance and stamina, the measure assesses flexibility and strength, which potentially are less sensitive to cardiac function. A positive smoking history
was predictive inversely of vitality (physical energy
and mental affect); an interaction between positive
smoking status and fewer years off therapy predicted
lower perceived general health perceptions. We
recently reported that childhood cancer survivors
may smoke to help reduce anxiety regarding their
cancer and its treatment.46 It remains to be determined to what extent smoking behavior may be a
proxy for increased anxiety or negative affect associated with a cancer diagnosis and/or recency of
therapy completion.
Previous studies demonstrated a correlation
between physical activity and improved cardiac function measures in adult cancer survivors and heart
failure patients. Aerobic training has improved maximum oxygen consumption and left ventricular remodeling significantly; and structured physical activity
has reduced left ventricular end-diastolic and endsystolic volume and increased left ventricular ejection fraction.47–49 Similarly, physical functioning,
physical well being, and fatigue have improved
through physical activity in cancer survivors.47,50 The
extent to which progressive aerobic exercise, initiated
before the manifestation of clinical cardiotoxicity,
may minimize progressive cardiac dysfunction and
maximize positive health perceptions in childhood
cancer survivors should be explored.
In a previous study23 of childhood cancer survivors, the SF-36 physical function component
explained only 7% of the variance in peak cardiac
output during exercise. In contrast, we observed that
treatment history, echocardiographic findings, and
cardiac risk factors explained from 13% to 28% of the
variation in the perceived health measures. Health
perceptions, taken together with treatment history
and cardiac risk assessment, may be early, strong
indicators or prognosticators of unidentified sequelae
that can and should be investigated by survivors’
physicians. Survivors who report perceptions of lower
health status may require more extensive and/or
more frequent cardiac assessment. Annual echocardiography51 and lipid profiles might be considered,
particularly in women survivors; the evaluation of
promising biomarkers of left ventricular compromise
(troponin, brain natriuretic peptide)52,53 may be a
future consideration.
Survivors’ perceived health status is recognized
as an important outcome of childhood cancer ther-

apy. The current comparison and previous reports22,24,25 have provided encouraging results
concerning the equivalency of survivors’ self-reported
health status to that of the general population. Linking survivors’ perceived health to more established
clinical indicators supports its potential usefulness as
a predictor of preclinical disease and opens a new
field of study.
