ABSTRACT
New targets for Ewing sarcoma (ES) patients are urgently needed. Therefore, we
investigated the expression and genetic aberrations of the oncogenic receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) AXL in ES and determined the efficacy of AXL targeting on cell viability
and migration. First, AXL and Gas6 (ligand) mRNA expression was determined by
RT-PCR on 29 ES samples. Low, medium and high AXL mRNA expression was
observed in 31% (n = 9), 48% (n = 14) and 21% (n = 6) of samples. Gas6 was
abundantly present in all specimens. We next tested AXL protein expression
immunohistochemically in 36 tumors (primary, post-chemotherapy, metastasized
and relapsed samples) from 25 ES patients. Low, medium and high AXL protein
expression was observed in 17% (n = 6), 19% (n = 7) and 36% (n = 13) of samples.
In primary tumors (n = 15), high AXL expression correlated significantly with a worse
overall survival compared to patients with lower expression (61 vs. 194 months,
p = 0.026). No genetic aberrations were detected in the AXL RTK domain (n = 29). The
AXL-inhibitor BGB324 affected viability (IC50 0.79–2.13 μmol/L) and migratory
potential of all tested ES cell lines in vitro (n = 5–6). BGB324 chemosensitized
chemotherapy-resistant ES-4 cells to vincristine and doxorubicin. These data suggest
that AXL is a potential novel, druggable therapeutic target in ES.

pivotal role in normal physiology, several RTKs have been
implicated in many human cancers [4]. More importantly,
the targeting of RTKs proved to be a valid approach to
inhibit growth of multiple tumor types. Although some
RTKs have been implicated in ES, predominantly the
Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Receptor (IGF-1R), and
more recently also MET and Anaplastic Lymphoma
Kinase (ALK), the role of several other RTKs remains to
be elucidated [5–8]. In this study, we investigated the role
of AXL in ES.
AXL (or UFO) is a member of the TAM (Tyro3,
AXL and MER) RTK family and plays an important
role in various cellular processes, including survival,
proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a highly aggressive type of
primary bone cancer, predominantly affecting children
and adolescents. Despite intensive surgery, radiotherapy
and polychemotherapy, the final outcome in patients
with metastatic disease has not improved impressively
during the last decades and side-effects of treatment could
be severe [1, 2]. This urges the need for novel, more
specific treatment strategies [3]. One group of promising
candidates of therapeutic targets are the receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs). RTKs are membrane-bound proteins and
are important regulators of cellular processes, such as cell
growth, proliferation and survival. In addition to their

Growth-arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) is the ligand
with the highest affinity for AXL. Similar to other RTKs,
AXL activation results in intracellular signal transduction
involving phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)/Akt kinase and
extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk) pathways [9].
Moreover, various studies demonstrated the oncogenic
potential of AXL, including a crucial role for AXL in
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which
is a key driver of metastasis, and mechanisms of drug
resistance including both conventional chemotherapy as
well as targeted therapies [10]. AXL overexpression and/or
activation was demonstrated in a variety of human tumors,
including several sarcomas [11–16]. AXL expression
is also associated with metastasis in many cancer types,
including osteosarcoma [9, 12, 17]. High AXL expression
predicts a poor outcome in patients with myxoid
liposarcoma and activated AXL was an independent
predictor of a worse prognosis in osteosarcoma
patients [12, 13]. Interestingly, AXL is also induced
during acquired therapy resistance including against
IGF-1R-targeted therapy in a rhabdomyosarcoma
model [18]. There are some indications that AXL could be
important in ES. For instance, gene expression profiling
of 14 primary tumors from localized, nonmetastatic ES
patients with clinical follow-up data revealed a poor
prognosis signature group in which the AXL gene was one
of many genes found to be significantly overexpressed [19].
In addition, a phosphoproteomics study identified
tyrosine phosphorylated AXL in 1 out of 2 ES cell lines
(RD-ES) [20].
Recently, the first-in class, highly selective AXL
tyrosine kinase inhibitor BGB324 (R428) entered phase
I clinical studies [21]. Encouraging first results of the
phase Ia study were reported and phase Ib trials in solid
and hematological malignancies are planned in the near
future [22, 23].
The exact function of AXL in ES is, however, still
unclear. We therefore examined AXL and Gas6 mRNA
and AXL protein expression levels in a well-defined cohort
of human ES specimens and correlated AXL protein
expression levels to clinicopathological characteristics and
patient outcome. Several tumor samples were examined
for genetic AXL aberrations as well. The effect of the
AXL inhibitor BGB324 was examined on ES cell viability,
chemo-sensitivity and migration in vitro to explore the
functional relevance of AXL-targeting in ES.

cases (Figure 1A). Gas6 was abundantly and identically
present in all ES samples. These findings prompted us
to further investigate AXL protein expression levels and
target localization in a well-defined cohort of ES patients
with clinical follow-up data.

levels
were
immunohistochemically analyzed in 36 samples obtained
from 25 ES patients, including 15 primary tumors
(pre-treatment), 11 post-chemotherapy resections,
7 distant metastases and 3 local relapses (Table 1).
Immunopositivity (defined as intensity score > 0) for AXL
was detected in the majority of specimens (n = 26; 72%)
and virtually all positive sections demonstrated protein
expression in > 70% of tumor cells (Figure 1B). Low and
medium AXL expression was observed in 17% (n = 6)
and 19% (n = 7) of ES samples, respectively. However,
the most outstanding samples were those with high AXL
expression, which was observed in 36% (n = 13) of cases.
AXL expression levels in these lesions were substantially
higher than in samples with medium or lower AXL
scores, and therefore seemed to be a distinct group. Also
compared to a panel of 80 breast carcinoma (BC) samples
stained in parallel, including triple-negative samples and
selected positive BC tissue controls, considerably higher
AXL expression was observed in ES samples (Figure 1F).
AXL was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm,
although some cases demonstrated apparent membraneaccentuated or nuclear AXL expression (Figure 1C
and 1D). In some samples, vascular endothelial AXL
expression was detected (Figure 1E).
In six ES specimens, both AXL mRNA and AXL
protein expression levels were evaluated. There was a
significant positive correlation between AXL mRNA and
protein expression (Spearmans ρ, p = 0.013, r = 0.867,
n = 6).
In the post-chemotherapy resection group, AXL
expression was significantly lower compared to expression
in the group of primary tumors (Table 2; p = 0.009). We
could not confirm this finding in a paired analysis, because
there were only three patients from which paired primary
and post-chemotherapy resection specimens were scored.
Kaplan-Meier (log-rank test) survival analysis was
performed on the primary tumors (n = 15) to investigate a
possible correlation between AXL expression and patient
outcome. No, low, medium and high AXL expression was
observed in 7% (n = 1), 20% (n = 3), 20% (n = 3) and
53% (n = 8) of primary tumors, respectively. Because
samples with highest AXL expression (score 3) seemed
to be a distinct group as described above and to increase
statistical power for survival analysis, the primary tumor
cohort was divided into two groups: low (scores 0–2)
and high (score  3) AXL expression. Interestingly, high
AXL expression correlated significantly with a worse
OS compared to low expression (61 ± 37 vs. 194 ± 40
months, p = 0.026) (Figure 1G). There was no significant
correlation between AXL expression and clinical

characteristics including tumor stage, tumor location and
age at diagnosis. Although some of these characteristics
have been linked to a poor prognosis in ES in other studies,
none of the characteristics correlated significantly with a
poor OS in our primary tumor cohort (not shown). These
findings suggest that AXL expression in the primary tumor
is an independent prognostic marker of poor prognosis in
ES, which was confirmed in a Cox multivariate regression
analysis (p = 0.021)(Supplemental Table 1).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Twenty-nine ES patients and six ES cell lines were
examined for genetic alterations in mRNA encoding the
AXL RTK domain. This domain was selected because it is
the intracellular catalytic subunit of the receptor mediating
signal transduction, and BGB324 specifically interferes
with this domain [24]. However, no aberrations were
observed.

than to doxorubicin (IC50 5.32 – 59.14 ng/mL) and
cyclophosphamide (IC50 225 – 541 ng/mL). The high
AXL- and Gas6-expressing ES-4 cell line was the most
resistant cell line to vincristine and doxorubicin. The
high AXL and low Gas6 expressing EW-8 cell line was
relatively the most resistant cell line to cyclophosphamide.
The addition of vincristine to BGB324 resulted in
synergistic effects (CI < 1) in ES-4 at all but one (nearly
additive) tested concentrations, and in the other cell
lines at some concentrations (Figure 2E). In ES-1,
ES-2, ES-7, ES-8 and EW-8 cell lines, the combination of
BGB324 with doxorubicin resulted in antagonistic effects
(CI > 1 at all tested doses; not shown). However, in the
highly doxorubicin-resistant ES-4 cell line, synergistic
or additive effects were observed for most tested
concentrations (Figure 2F). The combination of BGB324
with cyclophosphamide resulted in moderate antagonistic
effects in all cell lines (data not shown).

To further investigate whether AXL represents a
potential therapeutic target in ES, we examined the effects
of AXL-inhibition (BGB324) and Gas6 stimulation in
six ES cell lines in vitro by MTT assays. All cell lines
demonstrated AXL protein and mRNA expression,
although expression levels varied (Figure 2A-C). There
was a substantial variation in Gas6 mRNA expression
between the cell lines (Figure 2A). Similar to ES
specimens, AXL protein expression levels reflected
AXL mRNA levels in ES cell lines (Figure 2A-C).
BGB324 affected cell viability in all ES cell lines in
a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values ranging
from 0.79–2.13 μmol/L (Supplemental Table 2). No
correlations between AXL or Gas6 expression and
BGB324 responsiveness were found in this assay. The
effects of BGB324 on phosphorylated (p)AKT, pERK,
pS6RP and p4EBP1 expression are seen in Figure 2D.
Not all cell lines demonstrated similar effects. pAKT and
pERK levels either decreased or remained similar, pS6RP
levels decreased, increased or remained similar and no
apparent effects were observed concerning p4EBP1
expression levels. Gas6 stimulation up to 400 ng/mL did
not significantly affect cell viability in any of the ES cell
lines in this assay (Supplemental Figure 1).

Cell migration assays
Because several studies implicated AXL in
tumor migration, we investigated whether AXL has
similar functions in ES. In vitro migration assays were
performed with ES-2, ES-4, ES-7, ES-8 and EW-8 cell
lines (Figure 3). The ES-1 cell line could not reliably be
analyzed in this assay and was therefore excluded from
this analysis. Significant inhibition of migration was
observed during BGB324 treatment in all tested cell lines
(Figure 4). The inhibitory effect on migration was dosedependent in ES-2, ES-7, ES-8 and EW-8 cell lines, but
not in the ES-4 cell line. Significant inhibition of migration
was already observed after 16 hours of incubation with
IC75 and IC90 concentrations of BGB324 in all cell lines.
The most potent anti-migratory effects were observed in
the ES-7 cell line, closely followed by ES-8 and ES-2 cell
lines (Figure 4 and Table 3). In ES-8 and ES-2 cell lines,
even treatment with the IC25 concentration of BGB324
inhibited cell migration at some time points. Although
BGB324 significantly inhibited cell migration in ES-4 and
EW-8 cells, which was already significant after 16 hours
of treatment with the IC25 concentration of BGB324 in the
ES-4 cell line, the anti-migratory effects in these two cell

BGB324 and chemotherapy
Because in the clinic novel anti-cancer therapeutics
are usually combined with conventional cytotoxic
treatment, and AXL is implicated in chemotherapy
resistance as well as in potentiating the effects of
chemotherapy in other tumor types, we tested in vitro
whether BGB324 synergizes with three commonly used
chemotherapeutics in ES, all from different classes of
chemotherapy: doxorubicin (anti-tumor antibiotic),
vincristine (mitotic inhibitor) and cyclophosphamide
(alkylating agent) [10, 25]. The sensitivity of
individual ES cell lines to doxorubicin, vincristine and
cyclophosphamide (4-HC) monotherapies are summarized
in Supplemental Table 2, and ES cell lines were relatively
more sensitive to vincristine (IC50 0.58 –  1.72 ng/mL)

in this assay.
Figure 5 illustrates the hypothesized interplay
of AXL, Gas6 and BGB324 within the ES cell, also in
relation to chemotherapy and other RTKs.

in a larger, prospective cohort would be mandatory, the
correlation between AXL expression and outcome is strong
and consistent with a biological hypothesis. Moreover,
since various studies reported AXL to be a promising
oncological target in BC, and substantially higher AXL
expression levels were observed in ES specimens in
the present study, this further supports a rationale to
target AXL in ES [10, 24, 27, 31]. On top of that, AXL
expression was strongly associated with a mesenchymal
phenotype across a panel of 643 human cancer cell lines
and ES are mesenchymal tumors [32].
In the present study, AXL mRNA expression levels
correlated well with protein expression in ES patient
samples and cell lines. To further investigate mechanisms
underlying aberrant AXL signaling, we screened the AXL
RTK domain in several ES patients and in our ES cell
lines. However, no aberrations were found, suggesting
that ES harbor wild-type AXL, although we cannot
exclude aberrations outside the investigated domains.
These findings are in line with previous research, since at
present no (activating) AXL mutations have been reported
in other tumor types as well [29, 33]. The oncogenic
potential of AXL is therefore attributed to chronic
activation enabled by aberrant receptor expression and
autocrine or paracrine ligand stimulation. Interestingly,
various studies reported ligand-independent activation
of AXL [29, 34]. A similar effect may be present in
ES because Gas6 stimulation did not affect ES cell
viability, yet BGB324 did affect ES cell viability in vitro,
suggesting ligand-independent signaling of AXL. We
tried to assess phosphorylation of AXL (pAXL) in our
ES samples and cell lines, but unfortunately technical
difficulties precluded these determinations. Evaluation of
downstream pathway activation however demonstrated
a decrease in pAKT and pERK levels upon BGB324
treatment in some of the cell lines, which is in line with

DISCUSSION
AXL is a promising novel therapeutic target in a
variety of cancers, such as BC, acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic
cancer and prostate cancer [10, 23, 24, 26, 27]. In the
present study, we are the first to specifically implicate
AXL in ES. We demonstrated that both AXL and Gas6 are
abundantly expressed in tumors of ES patients and that
high AXL protein expression is an independent prognostic
marker of poor OS. We also showed that the specific AXLinhibitor BGB324 affected ES cell viability and migration
in almost all cell lines in vitro at clinically achievable
doses, highlighting its potential as a novel, druggable
therapeutic target in ES.
In this study, AXL was predominantly present in
the cytoplasm of ES cells, although membranous, nuclear
and vascular expression was occasionally reported as
well. This expression pattern closely resembles data
in other cancer types [27–30]. Most importantly, high
AXL expression levels in primary lesions correlated
significantly with a poor OS in ES patients, indicating
that AXL-targeting may be of particular interest for
patients with the worst prognosis. This is in line with
other studies, since a poor OS in ES is the result of an
inadequate response to conventional (chemo)therapy and
AXL has been specifically implicated in mechanisms of
drug resistance [10]. Although the number of patients
in our primary tumor cohort was low, and confirmation

The variations in effects on pS6RP expression illustrate
the complexity of these signaling cascades and warrant
further investigation. Although Gas6 stimulation did
not affect ES cell proliferation in vitro, BGB324 did

in osteosarcoma and triple-negative BC cell lines, AXLsignaling pathway interference had considerably greater
effects on migration than on proliferation in vitro [12, 24].

On top of that, there are indications that BGB324
could even be more potent in vivo and in ES patients. In
addition to tumor AXL expression, vascular AXL was also
reported in ES samples. Numerous preclinical and early
clinical data show that targeting of vascular mechanisms
could be effective in ES and BGB324 was shown to
suppress angiogenesis in in vivo tumor models [24, 36].
Moreover, the IC50 values in our study are nearly identical
to those reported in numerous studies in other cancer types
(range 0.81 – 3.15 μM) [24, 26, 35, 37, 38]. Some of these
studies performed subsequent in vivo experiments with the
same cell lines as tested in vitro and showed effective antitumor efficacy of BGB324 at clinically achievable doses
[24, 26]. Furthermore, all ES patients showed apparent
Gas6 levels to potentially activate AXL. The occasionally
reported membranous or nuclear localization of AXL in
ES patients may reflect AXL pathway activation, although
this requires further investigation.
Although at present no clinical data are available
concerning the efficacy and safety of BGB324 in cancer
patients, BGB324 was recently evaluated in early clinical
safety studies in healthy volunteers with encouraging
results. Treatment with BGB324 was established as being
safe and well tolerated [23]. Phase Ib clinical trials with
this compound will be initiated in the near future for the
treatment of aggressive and metastatic cancers, including
AML and NSCLC [21, 22]. Other, less specific, AXLtargeting drugs including the multi-kinase inhibitors
cabozantinib (VEGFR2, MET and AXL), crizotinib
(MET, ALK and AXL), amuvatinib (PDGFR, c-KIT and
AXL) and bosutinib (Src, ABL and AXL) have already
been tested in cancer patients with promising results
and manageable and short-lasting side-effects [39–42].
Crizotinib was even well-tolerated in children [41]. We
therefore believe that BGB324 could be a promising
drug for future treatment of ES patients. Therapeutic
AXL antibodies are also in development with promising
in vitro and in vivo results in several tumor types [43].
For ES however, small molecule inhibitors instead
of antibodies may be the drugs of choice since it was
recently demonstrated in in vivo ES models that a smaller
IGF-1R-targeting compound exerted superior tumor
penetrating and thus better IGF-1R-targeting properties
than a relatively large IGF-1R-targeting antibody [44].
In addition, small molecule inhibitors are capable
of inhibiting ligand-independent receptor activation
whereas therapeutic receptor-blocking antibodies cannot
interfere with this process. Since Gas6 stimulation did not
significantly affect ES cell proliferation, yet BGB324 did
inhibit ES cell growth, this suggests ligand-independent
AXL-signaling which also limits the use of therapeutic
antibodies in ES.
Although the results of combined BGB324 and
chemotherapy treatments were not straightforward
by showing different combined effects with different

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

classes of chemotherapy, the combination of BGB324
with vincristine led to the use of less vincristine in most
cell lines to obtain a similar response. This could be an
important step towards reducing chemotherapy-induced
side-effects. Interestingly, in the high AXL- and Gas6expressing ES-4 cell line, synergistic or additive effects
were observed for most tested concentrations of vincristine
and doxorubicin. Because ES-4 was the most resistant cell
line to these two types of chemotherapy, this suggests that
particularly chemotherapy-resistant, thus poor-prognosis,
ES patients might benefit from a combination of BGB324
and chemotherapy. Because in our study, apart from the
ES-4 cell line, in all other ES cell lines the combination of
BGB324 with doxorubicin resulted in antagonistic effects,
this also shows that this particular combination should
be handled with caution for ES treatment. The latter
also applies to the combination of cyclophosphamide to
BGB324, since this led to moderate antagonism in all ES
cell lines. Although some studies reported potent effects
when combining BGB324 to chemotherapy, including
additive effects in combination with doxorubicin, a
very recent extensive study investigating the effects
of different types of chemotherapy (and other drugs)
combined to BGB324 in a large panel of human cancer
cell lines stress the importance of selecting the appropriate
class of inhibitor for combined treatment regimens
[24,  26,  32]. Similar to our present study, different
classes of chemotherapy exerted different cytotoxic
effects when combined to BGB324 [32]. Antagonism was
reported specifically when BGB324 was combined with
doxorubicin, while the combination of BGB324 to mitotic
inhibitors such as paclitaxel or docetaxel (same class as
vincristine) was synergistic. The authors concluded that
BGB324 synergistically interacts with anti-mitotic agents
and not with doxorubicin to reduce cell viability. Although
an alkylating agent such as cyclophosphamide was not
included in that study, the platinum drug cisplatin is
sometimes grouped with alkylating agents because it kills
cells in a similar way [45]. The combination of cisplatin to
BGB324 resulted in moderate antagonistic effects in that
study, similar to the combination of cyclophosphamide
to BGB324 in our present study [32]. Of note, the
synergistic interaction between AXL inhibition and antimitotic agents was particularly observed in mesenchymal
cells in the study of Wilson et al., which further supports
its use in ES since these are mesenchymal tumors [32].
From a clinical perspective, AXL-targeting alone or in
combination with the appropriate type of chemotherapy
could be a promising strategy for ES patients with (early)
chemotherapy resistance.
To date, IGF-1R is the most intensively studied
RTK target in ES. The lack of activity in high volume
malignancies and the observed and not fully elucidated
primary and acquired resistance to IGF-1R-targeted
therapies in ES patients unfortunately led to the suspension

12763

Oncotarget

of a lot of planned IGF-1R-targeted research. Because
AXL is induced during resistance development to
IGF-1R-targeted therapies in rhabdomyosarcomas, which
may also be the case in ES, this further supports a rationale
to target AXL in ES [18]. Furthermore, Gas6 inhibits­
IGF-1R signaling [46]. Since Gas6 is ubiquitously present
in ES as demonstrated in this study, as well as IGF-1R
does, ES may not depend on IGF-1R signaling because this
pathway may already be blocked by the abundant levels
of Gas6. Gas6 additionally activates AXL, which could
mean that AXL-targeting is a more attractive approach
to treat ES patients in the future than IGF-1R-targeting.
Because evidence is growing towards the conception
that the targeting of multiple RTKs is a more effective
approach than targeting of a single RTK, and AXL has
been implicated in resistance against IGF-1R-targeted
therapy, co-targeting of AXL and IGF-1R could also be an
effective treatment strategy for ES, which we are currently
investigating [4, 18]. This is however still speculative, thus
further research on this topic is warranted.
Altogether, we showed for the first time that AXL
is a potential novel and druggable therapeutic target
in ES. High AXL expression in primary ES appeared
to be a strong independent predictor of poor OS. Since
the leading cause of ES patient mortality is metastatic
disease and BGB324 clearly inhibited ES cell migration
in vitro, this may offer great potential. Moreover,
because AXL is implicated in chemotherapy resistance,
and BGB324 chemosensitized chemotherapy-resistant
ES-4 cells to vincristine and doxorubicin, the combination
of BGB324 to chemotherapy may be of particular interest
to ES patients with a poor response to conventional
chemotherapy. Our data also stress the importance of
selecting the appropriate chemotherapeutic agent for
future combination studies, since different classes of
chemotherapy exerted different therapeutic effects in
combination with BGB324. Although further (in vivo)
research is warranted, we believe that AXL-targeting is
a promising line of inquiry for ES treatment and could
have a significant impact on future outcomes for the often
young ES patients.

characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
In this study we used IHC to specifically investigate
AXL protein expression levels and target localization.
Selected AXL-positive BC tumor samples and the triplenegative BC cell line MDA-MB-231 served as positive
controls and selected AXL-negative BC samples and
substitution of the primary antibody by PBS, 1% BSA as
negative controls [27, 47]. Control tissues were stained
multiple times to verify the reliability and reproducibility
of the selected antibody. We also compared AXL
expression levels as determined on Western Blot to IHC
expression levels of six ES cell lines to further confirm
the capacity of IHC to reliably visualize varying AXL
expression levels. Subsequently, tissue microarrays
(TMAs) were constructed from formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) ES tissue blocks (core size 1 mm)
to allow simultaneous examination of ES specimens
under identical conditions. Two BC TMAs, consisting
of 80 primary BC samples including triple-negative
tumors, were stained in parallel. IHC was performed on
4 μm tissue sections. Sections were deparaffinized in
xylol and rehydrated through a graded ethanol into water
series. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwave
heating of slides in a 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6
for 10 min at 100 °C. Endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked with 3% H2O2 in distilled water for 10 min
at room temperature (RT), and nonspecific binding was
prevented by blocking with 20% normal goat serum in
phosphate-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin 1%
(PBS, 1% BSA) for 30 min at RT. Subsequently, sections
were incubated with monoclonal rabbit anti-AXL (1:1000,
Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) antibody
in PBS-BSA 1% overnight in a humidified chamber at
4°C. Sections were then incubated with a goat-anti-rabbit
biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200 in PBS-BSA 1%,
Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, UK) for 30 min at RT
followed by an incubation with an avidin-biotinylated
horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC) using Vectastain
ABC kit (1:100 in PBS-BSA 1%, Vector Laboratories)
for 30 min at RT. Next, the catalyzed reporter deposition
technique (CARD; 8 min RT) was used to enhance the
sensitivity of the staining method followed by a second
incubation with ABC for 15 min at RT. Finally, antibody
binding was visualized by an incubation for 7 min at
RT with 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine (Bright-DAB). Slides
were counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated and
coverslipped.
Slides were scored for AXL expression by two
independent observers and consensus cytoplasmic scores
were given as follows: 0, no positive cells; 1, low; 2,
medium; 3, high staining intensity (> 10% of tumor cells).

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patient characteristics
Thirty-six tumor samples from 25 patients diagnosed
with ES between 1986 and 2009 were retrieved from the
files of the dept. of Pathology of the Radboud University
Medical Centre (Radboud UMC), Nijmegen, the
Netherlands. In all patients the diagnosis was confirmed
by ES typical gene fusions and all were treated at the
Radboud UMC. The average follow-up was 66 months
(range 2–261 months). The study was performed in
accordance with the Code of Conduct of the Federation

Statistical analysis

Gel Electrophoresis ­(SDS-PAGE) gel under reducing
conditions and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. After blocking with blockbuffer (LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) in PBS (1:1) at room
temperature (RT) for 1 h, membranes were incubated
overnight at 4°C with monoclonal rabbit anti-AXL
(1:1000), monoclonal rabbit anti-phosphorylated (p)
AKT (1:1000), monoclonal rabbit anti-pERK (1:500),
polyclonal rabbit anti-pS6RP (1:1000) or monoclonal
rabbit anti-p4EBP1 (1:1000). All primary antibodies
are from Cell Signaling Technology. Next, the blots
were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a
goat-anti-rabbit fluor 680-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:5000, AlexaFluor, Invitrogen, OR, USA), incubated
for 1 h at RT with monoclonal mouse anti-α-tubulin
(1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as a loading control
and subsequently incubated for 1 h at RT with a
goat-anti-mouse fluor 800-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:5000, AlexaFluor, Invitrogen). The fluorescent signals
were analyzed with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(LI-COR Biosciences) and Odyssey Application Software
(version 3.0.30).

Correlations between categorical data were
calculated with Fisher’s exact test. Wilcoxon signedrank test was used to compare paired samples. Linear
correlation between two continuous parameters was
evaluated using Spearman correlation. Kaplan-Meier
and log-rank methods were used to draw and evaluate
the significance of survival curves. Multivariate Cox
regression analysis was used to adjust for other variables
after univariate survival analysis. Survival times are
presented as mean survival in months ± SD.

RT-PCR and sequence analysis
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) of the AXL RTK domain and Gas6 was
performed on 29 fresh frozen ES tissue samples (> 50%
tumor cells) and 6 ES cell lines. Total RNA was extracted
with RNA-Bee (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) according
to manufacturer’s protocol. Then, first strand cDNA
synthesis was performed on 1 μg RNA for 1 h at 42°C
with random hexamer primers (Promega, Leiden, the
Netherlands) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Breda, the Netherlands).
AXL RTK domain and Gas6 genes were subsequently
amplified by PCR (Supplemental Table 3). GAPDH was
used as a loading control. PCR reactions were performed
using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 1 μl cDNA and the
following programs: 94°C (10 min, all); 92°C (1 min),
62°C (45 sec), 72°C (1 min) for 35 cycles (AXL cDNA
sequencing); 94°C (45 sec), 55°C (45 sec), 72°C (1.5 min)
for 25 cycles (AXL mRNA expression) or 35 cycles (Gas6
mRNA expression); or 92°C (1 min), 60°C (45 sec), 72°C
(1 min) for 25 cycles (GAPDH mRNA expression);
and 72°C for 10 min (all). PCR products were analyzed
by agarose gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, AXL
samples amplified in 35 cycles were submitted to cDNA
sequencing using the BigDye Terminator reaction mix,
and samples were analyzed on the 3730 DNA Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems). Aberrations were confirmed by
repeat amplification/sequencing and by consensus among
two investigators.

Cell lines
ES cell lines (ES-1, ES-2, ES-4, ES-7, ES-8 and
EW-8) were generously provided by Peter Houghton of the
Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) (Columbus,
OH). The presence of EWS/FLI1 gene fusions was
confirmed by RT-PCR in all cell lines in our laboratory
prior to the initiation of the experiments. Cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Lonza Benelux BV,
Breda, the Netherlands) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Gibco, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands) and
1% penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza) in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37°C.

Compounds
BGB324 (R428), a well-characterized small
molecule inhibitor of AXL, was purchased from
Synkinase (Melbourne, Australia). BGB324 is unique
in its potent on-target activity and restricted selectivity
profile [24]. Doxorubicin and vincristine were purchased
(TEVA Pharmachemi B.V., Haarlem, the Netherlands).
4-Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC; pre-activated
derivative of cyclophosphamide) was purchased as well
(D-18864, Niomech, Bielefeld, Germany). Recombinant
human Gas6 (rhGas6) was purchased from R&D systems
(Minneapolis, USA).

Western Blot
For Western Blot analysis, protein extracts were
purified from ES cell lines. Cells were incubated in icecold RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors and the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g
at 4°C for 30 min. The protein concentrations of the
supernatants were determined with the BCA protein assay
system (Pierce Endogen, Rockford, IL, USA). Of each
cell line, equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were loaded
and run on a 6% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide

MTT assays
The effects of BGB324, rhGas6, doxorubicin,
vincristine and cyclophosphamide (4-HC) on cell viability
were assessed in MTT assays. ES cells were seeded

into flat-bottomed 96-well plates at 5,000 cells/100 μl/
well and allowed to adhere. Twenty-four hours later,
designated drug or ligand doses were added and cells were
incubated for 72 h. All drug concentrations and blanks
were completed in quadruplicate. Subsequently, 20 μl of
5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS was added to each
well and cells were incubated for another 3.5 h at 37°C.
Afterwards, the medium was carefully removed and the
formazan crystals were dissolved in 150 μl of acidified
isopropanol solution. Absorbance was read at 560 nm
using an ELISA reader. The experiments were repeated
in duplo (rhGas6) or triplicate (BGB324, doxorubicin,
vincristine and 4-HC) and IC50 values were calculated with
GraphPad Prism Version 4.00 software.

of its surface was covered with (relatively viable) cells
(Figure 3B). The degree of wound closure is depicted as
relative gap size (RGS = number of negative boxes at
any time/number of negative boxes at t = 0 h). Migration
assays were performed in three separate experiments.
A student’s t–test was used to compare differences in
wound closure between treatment groups.

Combination indices
To assess drug synergy between BGB324 and
doxorubicin, vincristine or cyclophosphamide (4-HC), the
combination index (CI) method was used as previously
described [48]. In combination experiments, ES cells
were treated with three designated doses of BGB324,
doxorubicin, vincristine and 4-HC (Supplemental Table 4)
and effects on cell viability were assessed by MTT
assays. We next identified concentrations of BGB324,
doxorubicin, vincristine and 4-HC monotherapies
necessary to obtain a similar reduction in cell viability as
observed with the combined treatments. Subsequently, CI
for the combination treatments was calculated as follows:
CI = [Ca,x/ICx,a] + [Cb,x/ICx,b]. Ca,x and Cb,x are the
concentrations of drugs A and B used in combination
to achieve x% drug effect, ICx,a and ICx,b are the
concentrations for single agents to achieve the same effect.
A CI < 1 indicates synergy of the combination therapy.
A CI equal to or higher than 1 indicates additivity or
antagonism, respectively.

In vitro migration assays
Cell wound healing assays were performed as
described previously to study cell migration [12].
ES cells were cultured in flat-bottomed six-wells plates
at 1.2 – 1.5 x 106 cells/2 ml/well and allowed to adhere.
When 80–100% confluence was reached, two slashes
were created in the middle of the wells with the tip of a
P-200 pipette. Cells were rinsed with PBS and replaced
with 2 ml media containing designated BGB324 doses
(IC25, IC50, IC75 and IC90 per cell line as determined with
MTT assay (Supplemental Table 5)). After 0, 16,  24
and 40 h incubation, and when possible also after 48,
64 and 72 h incubation, four pictures per well were
taken at 10x magnification focused on the gap using the
EVOS microscope (AMG/Invitrogen). Wound closure
was measured by placing a grid (23 × 16 square boxes)
over the pictures and counting the number of positive
boxes. A box was considered positive when at least 50%
