Abstract
Radiotherapy is used in locally advanced pancreatic cancers in which it can improve survival in combination
with gemcitabine. However, prognosis is still poor in this setting in which more effective therapies remain needed.
MLN4924 is an investigational small molecule currently in phase I clinical trials. MLN4924 inhibits NAE (NEDD8
Activating Enzyme), a pivotal regulator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF (SKP1, Cullins, and F-box protein), that has
been implicated recently in DNA damage and repair. In this study, we provide evidence that MLN4924 can be used
as an effective radiosensitizer in pancreatic cancer. Speciﬁcally, MLN4924 (20–100 nmol/L) effectively inhibited
cullin neddylation and sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to ionizing radiation in vitro with a sensitivity
enhancement ratio of approximately 1.5. Mechanistically, MLN4924 treatment stimulated an accumulation of
several SCF substrates, including CDT1, WEE1, and NOXA, in parallel with an enhancement of radiation-induced
DNA damage, aneuploidy, G2/M phase cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. RNAi-mediated knockdown of CDT1 and
WEE1 partially abrogated MLN4924-induced aneuploidy, G2/M arrest, and radiosensitization, indicating a causal
effect. Furthermore, MLN4924 was an effective radiosensitizer in a mouse xenograft model of human pancreatic
cancer. Our ﬁndings offer proof-of-concept for use of MLN4924 as a novel class of radiosensitizer for the treatment
of pancreatic cancer. Cancer Res; 72(1); 282–93. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading
cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and one
of the deadliest human malignancies, with an overall 5-year
survival rate of approximately 5% (1). Although gemcitabine is
the standard systemic therapy for pancreatic cancer (2), the
ﬁnding that as many as 1/3 of pancreatic cancer patients die of
locally destructive disease underscores the importance of
radiotherapy for local disease control (3). Indeed, the combination of radiation with gemcitabine has been shown to
signiﬁcantly prolong survival compared with gemcitabine
alone (4), and intensifying radiation also seems to improve
survival (5). Despite these improvements, the prognosis for
patients with pancreatic cancer is still very poor, and new
combinational therapies are urgently needed. Strategies

utilizing small molecule inhibitors to sensitize pancreatic
tumor cells to radiation (and gemcitabine) are well underway.
We have recently shown that small molecule inhibitors of
CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1), sensitized pancreatic tumor cells
and xenografts to radiation by G2 checkpoint abrogation and
homologous recombination repair inhibition (6). Of the small
molecule inhibitors tested in phase III clinical trials in pancreatic cancer, erlotinib, an inhibitor of epidermal growth
factor receptor with only very modest activity in pancreatic
cancer, has been shown to improve survival (7, 8). Thus, there is
a demand for novel and more effective therapies. Our laboratory has recently shown that SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases are
promising radiosensitizing targets in cancer cells (9, 10).
Whether inhibition of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases might also be
a useful strategy for sensitizing pancreatic cancers to radiation
has not previously been tested.
The SCF (SKP1-Cullin-F-box proteins) E3 ubiquitin ligases,
consisting of an adaptor protein SKP1, a scafford protein cullin,
a substrate receptor F-box protein, and a RING protein RBX1 or
RBX2, are the largest multiunit ubiquitin ligases (11, 12)
responsible for the ubiquitination of approximately 20% of all
ubiquitinated proteins for targeted degradation by proteasome
(13). The SCF E3s, therefore, regulate numerous biological
processes, including cell-cycle progression, signal transduction, and DNA replication, among others (11, 12). It is well
established that the core of SCF E3 ligase is a cullin-RING ﬁnger
protein complex (14). In human and mouse, there are 7 cullins
(cullins 1–3, 4A, 4B, 5, and 7) and 2 RING family members, RBX1

Radiosensitization of Pancreatic Cancer Cells by MLN4924

(RING box protein-1) and RBX2, also known as SAG (Sensitive
to Apoptosis Gene; refs. 11, 12, 15). The ligase activity of the SCF
requires (i) RBX1/RBX2, which binds to ubiquitin-loaded E2,
and (ii) cullin neddylation (16–19), the addition of a ubiquitinlike protein NEDD8 to cullin, catalyzed by NEDD8-activating
enzyme E1 (NAE), NEDD8-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBC12),
and NEDD8-E3 ligase (20).
We have recently shown that inactivation of SCF E3 ligase by
siRNA knockdown of either RBX1 or RBX2/SAG induced
apoptosis and senescence, and sensitized human cancer cells
to radiation (9, 10, 21), and that Sag knockout also sensitized
mouse embryonic stem cells to radiation via inducing apoptosis (22). Because MLN4924 effectively inactivates SCF E3 by
blocking cullin neddylation (13), we tested our working
hypothesis that MLN4924 could sensitize pancreatic cancer
cells to radiation. We reported here that MLN4924 indeed acts
as a radiosensitizing agent by enhancing radiation-induced
DNA damage, aneuploidy, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis via
mechanism including accumulation of CDT1 and WEE1, 2
well-known substrates of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase.

siRNA knockdown of CDT1 and WEE1
Two independent sets of siRNA oligonucleotides were
used to target CDT1 or WEE1, respectively. Their sequences
are as follows: siCDT1-1 (50 -CGUGGAUGAAGUACCCGACUU30 ) and siCDT1-2 (50 -GCAAUGUUGGCCAGAUCAAUU-30 ),
and siWEE1-1 (50 -GAGGCUGGAUGGAUGCAUUUU-30 ) and
siWEE1-2 (50 -CUCCGGGGUAGUUCUCUCUUU-30 ), and scrambled control siRNA (Si-Ctrl: 50 -ATTGTATGCGATCGCAGACTT-30 ). All oligos were purchased from Dharmacon. Cells
were transfected with siRNA using X-tremeGENE (Roche) and
split 48 hours later. One portion was used for clonogenic assay
and the other portions for immunoblotting (IB) or ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) proﬁle (23).
Immunoblotting
Cells were exposed to various treatments and harvested for
IB as described (23) using antibodies against CDT1, WEE1,
CUL1, total CDC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ORC1, p21, p27
(BD Biosciences), NOXA, BIM1, phospho-CHK1 (S345), phospho-CHK2 (T68), g-H2AX (Ser139), phospho-CDC2 (Y15),
phospho-IkB, Cyclin B1 (Cell Signaling), and b-actin (Sigma).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Two human MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer lines,
and human H1299 lung cancer cell line were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection. MiaPaCa-2 and H1299 cells
were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS. BxPC-3 and human lung
ﬁbroblast MRC5 cells (a gift from Dr. A. Rehemtulla) were
cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% FBS. All lines were tested and
were free of Mycoplasma contamination.
ATPlite growth assay and IC50 determination
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicate and treated
with MLN4924 (13), in various doses for 7 days. Cell viability
was measured with ATPlite Kit (Perkin Elmer; ref. 23).
MLN4924 preparation for in vitro and in vivo assays
MLN4924 was synthesized by Millennium Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (13) and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to make a 10
mmol/L stock solution and kept in 20 C before use. For in
vivo experiment, MLN4924 was freshly made every week as
follows: To make an 8.32 mg/mL solution, the compound was
dissolved in 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) in
sterile water. The pH value was adjusted to 5.0 with 1 mol/L
KOH. The solution of MLN4924 was stored at room temperature before use.
Radiation exposure and clonogenic assay
Cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes in duplicate and
exposed to different doses of radiation (Philips RT250,
Kimtron Medical) after pretreatment with MLN4924 for 6
hours (at 100 nmol/L) or 24 hours (at 20–30 nmol/L).
MLN4924 was either washed away (at 100 nmol/L) or stayed
in the medium (at 20–30 nmol/L) afterwards, followed by
incubation at 37 C for 7 to 9 days. Survival curves were ﬁtted
using the linear-quadratic equation, and the mean inactivation dose was calculated (24).

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
Cells were treated with MLN4924, or exposed to radiation
alone or in combination. Cells were harvested 24 or 48 hours
postradiation and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (23).
Immunoﬂuorescence staining
Cells after exposure to various treatments were ﬁxed with
4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100,
blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with
primary antibody against g-H2AX (Millipore) at 1:1,000, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG
at 1:2,000. Cellular nuclei were stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole, as described (9). The stained cells were observed
under ﬂuorescent microscope (Olympus 1  71), using Olympus LCP lan F1 lens and Olympus DP70 cameras. The acquisition software used was Olympus DP Controller 2002 (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd).
In vivo antitumor study
All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the
guidelines established by the University Committee on Use and
Care of Animals. Five million MiaPaCa-2 cells were inoculated
subcutaneously in both ﬂanks of nude mice. The mice were
randomized and the treatment started when the tumor size
reached 100 mm3 at 14 days after inoculation. MLN4924 (30
mg/kg, s.c.) and radiation (1 Gy) were given once a day, 5 days a
week for 3 weeks. Radiation was delivered directly to the tumor
with the rest of the animal shielded. For combination treatment, MLN4924 was given 2 hours prior to radiation exposure
with the same schedule as for individual treatments. The
growth of tumors (8 for control group, 12–16 for the other
groups) was measured twice a week and average tumor
volumes were calculated, as estimated from the formula
(L  W2)/2. Radiation was conducted in the University of
Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center Experimental Radiation Core.

Statistical analysis
ANOVA models were used with SPSS software for statistical
comparisons involving multiple groups, followed by an SNK
post hoc test to determine signiﬁcance of each of 2 groups (P <
0.05). Tumor volume doubling (tripling) was determined for
each xenograft by identifying the earliest day on which it was at
least twice (3 times) as large as on the ﬁrst day of treatment. A
cubic smoothing spline was used to obtain the exact time of
doubling (tripling). The Kaplan–Meier method was used to
analyze the doubling (tripling) times derived from the
smoothed growth curves, and the cox regression model was
used for comparisons between any 2 treatment groups after
adjusting the initial tumor sizes. Bayesian hierarchical changepoint model was conducted to estimate the tumor growth
proﬁle characterized by a prenadir regression rate, a regression
period, a nadir volume, and a postnadir regrowth rate. The 90%
highest probability density (HPD) CIs were calculated to
compare these features between different treatments. If the
HPD interval of the difference in any feature between two
treatments covers zero, the two treatments are not signiﬁcantly different on that feature at the signiﬁcant level of 0.1
(25).

Results
Sensitivity of pancreatic cancer lines to MLN4924 as a
single agent
Our recent studies showed that inactivation of SCF E3
ubiquitin ligase by siRNA knockdown of its RING component,
RBX1 or RBX2/SAG, sensitized human cancer cells to radiation
(9, 10), whereas Sag knockout also sensitized mouse embryonic
stem cells to radiation by inducing apoptosis (22), suggesting
that SCF E3 is an attractive radiosensitizing target. Here, we
tested our working hypothesis that MLN4924, a small molecule
inhibitor of NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE), which suppresses cancer cell growth by inhibiting activity of SCF E3
ubiquitin ligase via cullin deneddylation (13), could be a novel
radiosensitizing agent in pancreatic cancer cells.
We ﬁrst determined the sensitivity of 2 pancreatic cancer
lines, MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3 to MLN4924 as a single agent. In
an ATPlite-based 7-day cell proliferation assay, MLN4924
effectively suppressed growth of MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells
with an IC50 of 45 or 177 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1A). In a
standard clonogenic survival assay with MLN4924 in the
culture medium for 7 to 9 days, MLN4924 caused a dosedependent inhibition of colony formation with an IC50 of
approximately 25 to 50 nmol/L (Fig. 1B). Thus, MLN4924 is
a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation and survival in pancreatic cancer cell lines, with a higher efﬁcacy against MiaPaCa-2
cells.
MLN4924 sensitized cancer cells but not normal cells to
radiation
We then determined the potential radiosensitizing effect of
MLN4924 in pancreatic cancer cells. We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that
MLN4924 treatment indeed caused deneddylation of cullin 1;
MLN4924 at 100 nmol/L for a 6-hour exposure was sufﬁcient to
block cullin neddylation (Fig. 1C). We next used 2 different

284

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

dosing regimens to test MLN4924 radiosensitization. In the
ﬁrst regimen (higher MLN4924 dose with shorter exposure
time), cells were pretreated with MLN4924 (100 nmol/L) for 6
hours, which effectively caused the accumulation of CDT1 and
WEE1 (two critical substrates of SCF E3 ligase, see below;
Supplementary Fig. S1), followed by radiation at different doses
up to 8 Gy. MLN4924 was washed out 24 hours postradiation
and cells were cultured in MLN4924-free medium for additional 6 to 9 days, allowing colony formation. Under this
condition, MLN4924 effectively sensitized both pancreatic
cancer cell lines to radiation with a sensitivity enhancement
ratio (SER) of 1.43 to 1.55, respectively (Fig. 1D). In the second
regimen (lower MLN4924 dose with longer exposure time), we
pretreated cells with MLN4924 at a lower concentration (20
nmol/L for MiaPaCa-2 and 25 nmol/L for BxPC-3) for 24 hours,
followed by radiation at different doses up to 8 Gy. Cells
were then cultured for additional 7 to 9 days in the presence
of MLN4924 at these low doses (without medium change).
Under this condition, we conﬁrmed that cullin-1 was deneddylated throughout the experimental periods (Supplementary
Fig. S2A) and observed MLN4924 radiosensitization with SER
of approximately 1.4 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Thus, we
conclude that MLN4924 is a potent radiosensitizer in pancreatic cancer cells.
To determine whether radiosensitization by MLN4924 is
tumor cell selective, we assessed the ability of MLN4924 to
radiosensitize H1299 lung cancer cells, paired with human lung
ﬁbroblast MRC5 cells, because there are no "normal" pancreatic cells capable of forming colonies in standard clonogenic
assays. We found that in H1299 cancer cells, but not in MRC5
normal cells, that cullin-1 is highly neddylated, which is
completely inhibited by MLN4924 at 100 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Consistent with targeting cullin neddylation,
MLN4924 was 5-fold more potent in growth suppression of
H1299 cancer cells (IC50 ¼ 83 nmol/L) than MRC5 normal cells
(IC50 ¼ 429 nmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S3B) and was 4-fold
more potent in inhibition of clonogenic survival of H1299
cells (IC50 ¼ 50 nmol/L) than MRC5 normal cells (IC50 ¼
200 nmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S3C). Likewise, MLN4924 at as
low as 15 nmol/L sensitized radioresistant H1299 cells (23) to
radiation with a SER of 1.39 but had little effect on MRC5 cells
(SER ¼ 1.13; Supplementary Fig. S3D). Thus, MLN4924 seems
to selectively target cancer cells with high levels of cullin
neddylation and SCF E3 ligase activity.
Radiosensitization by MLN4924 is attributable to
enhanced G2/M arrest, aneuploidy, and induction of
apoptosis
To determine the nature of MLN4924 radiosensitization, we
carried out cell-cycle proﬁle of 2 pancreatic cancer cell lines
treated with MLN4924, radiation, or MLN4924 in combination
with radiation (Fig. 2A), and found that MLN4924 remarkably
enhanced the radiation-induced G2/M arrest in MiaPaCa-2 (IR
at 34% vs. IR plus MLN4924 at 68%) and BxPC-3 cells (IR at 52%
vs. IR plus MLN4924 at 65%; Fig. 2B). MLN4924 also increased
the aneuploid cell population (DNA content greater than 4N)
from 10% in response to radiation alone to 40% in response to
radiation plus MLN4924 in MiaPaCa-2 cells and from 4% to 24%

MLN4924 enhanced radiation-induced DNA damage
Because the major cellular effect of ionizing radiation is to
cause DNA damage and trigger the DNA damage response (26),
we, therefore, examined whether MLN4924 treatment would
enhance radiation-induced DNA damage and interfere with
the DNA damage repair process. We determined DNA doublestrand breaks (DSB) by measuring the overall levels of g-H2AX
protein and formation of nuclear foci upon radiation and
MLN4924 treatment, alone or in combination. We found the
levels of g-H2AX increased regardless of single or combination

group at 24 hours for both pancreatic cancer cell lines (Fig. 3A).
Consistently, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in the population of g-H2AX foci positive cells in combination treatment
group (Fig. 3B and C). We also determined the DNA damage
response upon MLN4924 radiation treatment by measuring
phosphorylation of CHK1 and CHK2 and found that although
MLN4924 did not enhance CHK2 phosphorylation, MLN4924

particularly at the later 24-hour time point (Fig. 3D). Similar
enhancement of radiation-induced g-H2AX levels and CHK1
phosphorylation by MLN4924 was also observed in H1299 lung
cancer cells, which are sensitive to MLN4924 radiosensitization, but not in MRC5 lung ﬁbroblast, which are resistant to
MLN4924 radiosensitization (Supplementary Fig. S4). Taken
together, these results suggested that MLN4924 enhances
radiation-induced DNA damage and prolongs the process of
DNA repair, which likely contributes to its radiosensitizing
effects.
MLN4924 caused accumulation of SCF E3 ligase
substrates, which is responsible for G2/M arrest and
DNA damage response
To identify the mediators of MLN4924 which lead to the
enhanced radiation effects, we measured the levels of proteins known to be (i) the substrates of SCF E3 ligases and (ii)
involved in the regulation of cell-cycle progression, DNA
damage response, and apoptosis (10, 12, 27). We found that
as expected, the levels of cell-cycle regulators, including p21,
p27, WEE1, DNA licensing proteins CDT1 and ORC1, and
apoptosis regulators NOXA, BIM EL, and pIkBa, increased
substantially upon treatment with MLN4924, but not
radiation (Fig. 4). The MLN4924–radiation combination
further increased the levels of CDT1 and NOXA (Fig. 4), as
well as WEE1 activity, as reﬂected by enhanced phosphorylation of its substrate, CDC2 (Y15; Fig. 4, bottom panels),
suggesting these 3 proteins may contribute to MLN4924
radiosensitization.

Partial rescue of aneuploidy, G2/M arrest, and
radiosensitization by siRNA knockdown of CDT1 and
WEE1
Because apoptosis seems to be a late and secondary effect of
MLN4924 radiation (Fig. 2D), likely resulting from enhanced
DNA damage and prolonged G2/M arrest, we focused our
attention on CDT1, a DNA licensing protein whose overexpression is known to cause DSB and trigger DNA damage response
(9, 28), and WEE1, a protein tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates
CDC2 on Tyr15 to arrest cells at the G2 phase of cell cycle
(29, 30). We reasoned that if CDT1 and/or WEE1 were critical
to MLN4924-induced enhancement of radiation effects, we
should be able to abrogate these effects, at least in part, by
their simultaneous knockdown. Indeed, in MLN4924–radiation–treated cells, CDT1 knockdown, using 2 independent
siRNA oligos signiﬁcantly reduced CHK1 phosphorylation (Fig.
5A and Supplementary Fig. S5A), with a consequent reduction
of the aneuploid population from approximately 40% to 30%
(Fig. 5B) or from 34% to 19% (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Likewise,
WEE1 knockdown using 2 independent siRNA oligos abrogated
CDC2 phosphorylation at Y15 (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. S5A)
and reduced the G2/M population from 74% to 55% (Fig. 5C)
or 72% to 56% (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Importantly,
MLN4924 radiosensitization was largely abrogated upon
knockdown of CDT1 or WEE1, as assayed by the ﬁrst regimen
(Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S5D), as well as the second
regimen (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These results clearly suggest
a causal effect of CDT1 and/or WEE1 accumulation (upon SCF
E3 inactivation by MLN4924) on MLN4924 radiosensitization
in MiaPaCa-2 cells. On the other hand, the incomplete rescue
of MLN4924 radiosensitization upon CDT1 and/or WEE1
knockdown suggests that other downstream targets (such as
p21 or p27, Fig. 4) may also mediate the efﬁcacy of MLN4924.
MLN4924 sensitized MiaPaCa-2 cells to radiation in an in
vivo xenograft tumor model
Finally, we assessed MLN4924-mediated radiosensitization
in vivo using the MiaPaCa-2 xenograft model. To ensure that
MLN4924 "hits" its target cullin-1 in in vivo tumors and to
determine when radiation should be delivered post MLN4924
administration, we measured the levels of MLN4924-conjugated NEDD8, neddylated cullin-1, SCF substrates, WEE1, and
NRF2 at the indicated times after a single administration of
vehicle, MLN4924, radiation, or MLN4924 plus radiation
(2 representative tumors per group). As shown in Fig. 6A,
MLN4924–NEDD8 adduct was detectable only in groups with
MLN4924 treatment, alone (lanes 5 and 6) or in combination
(lanes 13 and 14) at the early time point (4 hours), which nearly
disappeared at 24 hours posttreatment (lanes 7 and 8 and 15
and 16). Similarly, cullin-1 neddylation was inhibited with a
corresponding increase in the SCF E3 substrates WEE1 and
NRF2 in MLN4924-treated groups at the early 4-hour time
point (lanes 5 and 6 and 13 and 14). At later time point (24
hours), both neddylated cullin-1 and NRF2 levels returned to
the control levels with WEE1 level remaining slightly higher
(lanes 7 and 8 and 15 and 16; Fig. 6A). As expected, radiation
alone had no effect on cullin-neddylation or the levels of
selected SCF E3 substrates (lanes 9–12). Our results clearly

radiation should be delivered 2 hours postadministration of
MLN4924, when SCF E3 is inactivated due to cullin

We next determined the in vivo radiosensitizing activity of
MLN4924. As shown in Fig. 6B and C, administration of
MLN4924 alone at a dose of 30 mg/kg s.c./d, 5 d/wk for 3
weeks had a moderate inhibitory effect on tumor growth in
nude mice. Radiation treatment at a clinically relevant dose of 1
Gy/d, 5 d/wk for 3 weeks also had moderate antitumor activity.

In response to treatment with the combination of MLN4924
and radiation, tumor growth was signiﬁcantly inhibited compared with either treatment alone (at day 60; Fig 6B).
Similarly, the time required for tumor volume doubling or
tripling was signiﬁcantly increased in response to MLN4924
radiation treatment compared with vehicle or radiation
treatment (Fig. 6C). Consistent with this, we also observed
a signiﬁcantly reduced tumor volume nadir corresponding
with a marginally signiﬁcant increase in the tumor regression rate in response to MLN4924 radiation (compared with

results showed that MLN4924 is a radiosensitizer in pancreatic cancer, as assessed in both in vitro cell culture and in

of CDT1 and WEE1, among with other substrates of SCF E3

Discussion
Our previous work has shown that SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase
is an attractive anticancer target (for review, see refs. 15,
31–33). However, because of the complexity of establishing a
high-throughput (HTS) screen for multi-components SCF E3
ubiquitin ligase, there is no single small molecule discovered
that directly inhibits its ligase activity, although a number of

Radiosensitization of Pancreatic Cancer Cells by MLN4924

HTS methods have been established and optimized to screen
for small molecule inhibitors of single peptide E3 ligases
(31, 34). MLN4924 is a newly discovered small molecule
inhibitor of NAE (13). MLN4924 binds to NAE at its active
site to create a covalent NEDD8–MLN4924 adduct, which
resembles NEDD8 adenylate, but cannot be further utilized
in subsequent intraenzyme reactions, thus inhibiting NAE
activity and blocking cullin neddylation (13, 35). Because
cullin neddylation is required for SCF E3 activity (16, 18, 19),
MLN4924 becomes the ﬁrst of a class of "indirect" inhibitors
of SCF E3. By inhibiting SCF E3 ligase activity, MLN4924
causes the accumulation of a number of SCF E3 substrates to
suppress the growth of acute myeloid leukemia (36), diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (37), and many cancer cell lines
derived from solid tumors both in vitro and in vivo by
inducing apoptosis (13, 36, 37) and senescence (38–40).
Importantly, in vivo xenograft assays showed that MLN4924
was well tolerated in mice at various doses and treatment
regimens (13), showing a selective killing of cancer cells.
With all these preclinical efﬁcacies, MLN4924 has been
advanced to several phase I clinical trials for solid tumors
and hematologic malignancies (41).
In this study, we tested our hypothesis that MLN4924 is a
potent radiosensitizing agent for pancreatic cancer cells,
based upon our target validation work using both siRNA
knockdown and gene knockout approaches for RBX1 and
SAG, the RING components of SCF E3, required for its ligase
activity (9, 10, 21, 22). For the ﬁrst time, we showed here that
in in vitro cell culture models, MLN4924 was a potent growth
inhibitor as a single agent, as well as a radiosensitizer in 2
pancreatic cancer cell lines and in 1 lung cancer cell line, but
not normal lung ﬁbroblast cells. The resistance of normal
ﬁbroblasts to MLN4924 radiosensitization is likely due to the
lack of cullin neddylation. We also showed in vivo, using a
MiaPaCa-2 xenograft model, that MLN4924 inhibited tumor
growth and conferred radiosensitization with minimal toxicity to the mice. Mechanistically, we showed that MLN4924
enhanced radiation-induced G2/M arrest, aneuploidy, and,
eventually, apoptosis by inhibiting cullin neddylation to
trigger the accumulation of a number of SCF E3 substrates,
related to DNA damage response and cell-cycle regulation.
Among these accumulated substrates, CDT1 and WEE1 were
further increased when combined with radiation and were
critical for enhanced DNA damage and aneuploidy or G2/M
arrest, respectively, and eventually for MLN4924 radiosensitization, as evidenced by siRNA knockdown-based rescuing
experiments.
Precise duplication of the genome at the S phase of each
cell cycle requires initiation of DNA replication from thousands of origins. Initiation of too few origins would cause
collapse of replication forks, leading to DNA damage and
incomplete replication of the genome, whereas more than
one initiation of DNA replication per cell cycle would cause
DNA "hyperreplication" or "rereplication" and subsequent
DNA damage (42), leading to genomic instability and cancer
(43). CDT1 is a key licensing factor which, along with the
protein CDC6, functions to form the prereplicative complex
(pre-RC) to initiate DNA replication (44). It was recently

www.aacrjournals.org

reported that overexpression of Double-arked (Dup), the
Drosophila ortholog of CDT1 caused DNA rereplication and
DNA damage, followed by caspase activation and apoptotic
cell death (45). In human U2-OS cancer cells, CDT1 overexpression caused double strand breaks to trigger DDR,
followed by induction of senescence and apoptosis (28).
Induction of CDT1 accumulation by MLN4924 was found
to be attributable to DNA rereplication, aneuploidy, and
apoptotic death in HCT116 cells (13, 40, 46). Our data
presented here indicated that CDT1 accumulation is also
found in 2 pancreatic cancer cell lines and is critical for
enhanced aneuploidy and MLN4924 radiosensitization.
The WEE1 kinase negatively regulates G2/M transition by
directly phosphorylating Tyr15 of CDC2, which inhibits the
CDC2 activity (30). We have previously shown that WEE1 can
be stabilized and activated by binding to 14-3-3b (47) and is a
valid radiosensitizing target, whose inhibition abrogates
the radiation-induced G2 checkpoint (48, 49). In this study,
we found that the level of WEE1, a substrate of SCF E3 ligase
(50), increased expectedly upon MLN4924 treatment. The
WEE1 activity was further enhanced when MLN4924 was
combined with radiation. Our rescue experiment showed that
accumulated WEE1 is responsible, at least in part, for a
remarkable increase in the G2/M population in response to
MLN4924 and radiation, which seems causally related to
MLN4924 radiosensitization.
In summary, our study revealed radiosensitizing activity
of MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of SCF E3, in
pancreatic cancer as well as in lung cancer cells, and
elucidated its mechanisms of action which include accumulation of CDT1 and WEE1, among other cell cycle and
apoptosis regulators, which trigger DNA damage, aneuploidy
and G2/M arrest, followed by apoptotic death. Our study,
therefore, provides the ﬁrst preclinical proof-of-concept
evidence for future development of MLN4924 as a novel
radiosensitizing agent against pancreatic cancer and, possibly, other types of human cancers.
