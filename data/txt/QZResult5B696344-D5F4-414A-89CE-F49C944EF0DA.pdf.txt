ABSTRACT:
Melanoma is one of the most lethal forms of skin cancer and its incidence is
continuing to rise in the United States. Therefore, novel mechanism and targetbased strategies are needed for the management of this disease. SIRT1, a NAD(+)dependent class III histone deacetylase, has been implicated in a variety of
physiological processes and pathological conditions. We recently demonstrated that
SIRT1 is upregulated in melanoma and its inhibition by a small-molecule, tenovin-1,
inhibits cell proliferation and clonogenic survival of melanoma cells, possibly via
activating p53. Here, we employed a gel free quantitative proteomics approach to
identify the downstream effectors and targets of SIRT1 in melanoma. The human
malignant melanoma, G361 cells were treated with tenovin-1 followed by protein
extraction, in liquid trypsin digestion, and peptide analyses using nanoLC-MS/MS.
A total of 1091 proteins were identified, of which 20 proteins showed significant
differential expression with 95% confidence interval. These proteins were subjected
to gene ontology and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to obtain the information
regarding their biological and molecular functions. Real-Time qRT-PCR validation
showed that five of these (PSAP, MYO1B, MOCOS, HIST1H4A and BUB3) were
differentially expressed at mRNA levels. Based on their important role in cell cycle
regulation, we selected to focus on BUB family proteins (BUB3, as well as BUB1 and
BUBR1) for subsequent validation. The qRT-PCR and immunoblot analyses showed
that tenovin-1 inhibition of SIRT1 resulted in a downregulation of BUB3, BUB1 and
BUBR1 in multiple melanoma cell lines. Since tenovin-1 is an inhibitor of both SIRT1
and SIRT2, we employed lentivirus mediated silencing of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in G361
cells to determine if the observed effects on BUB family proteins are due to SIRT1or SIRT2- inhibition. We found that only SIRT1 inhibition resulted in a decrease in
BUB3, BUB1 and BUBR1. Our study identified the mitotic checkpoint regulator BUB
family proteins as novel downstream targets of SIRT1. However, further validation is
needed in appropriate models to confirm our findings and expand on our observations.

INTRODUCTION

have been on rise for the last 30 years [2]. The existing
preventive or therapeutic approaches have not been able to
effectively manage this deadly cancer and therefore, novel
mechanism- and target- based approaches are needed for
its management.
We have recently shown that the class III histone
deacetylase (HDAC) SIRT1 is upregulated in human
melanoma cells and tissues, and its small molecule

Melanoma is one of the most lethal forms of
skin cancer. In the United States, 76,690 new cases of
melanoma and 9,480 melanoma-related deaths were
predicted for the year 2013 [1]. Epidemiological data
suggests that age-adjusted annual incidences of melanoma

inhibition by tenovin-1 causes anti-proliferative responses,
which are mediated via activation of p53, in human
melanoma cells [3, 4]. This is an interesting finding
because the sirtuin (SIRT) family of NAD(+)-dependent
protein deacetylases has been implicated in a wide range
of biological processes, including genetic control of aging,
regulating transcription, apoptosis, stress resistance and
energy efficiency during low-calorie conditions [5-7].
SIRT proteins arbitrate post-translational alterations of the
N-terminal tails of histone proteins, which bundle DNA
into chromatin and play crucial roles in the regulation
of gene expression [5]. Mammals possess seven SIRTs
(SIRT1-7) that occupy different subcellular compartments
such as the nucleus (SIRT1, -2, -6, -7), cytoplasm (SIRT1,
-2) and the mitochondria (SIRT3, -4, -5), and exhibit
different functions [8]. The role and functional significance
of SIRTs in cancer development and progression is
currently an intense area of research investigation [911]. SIRT1 has been shown to be upregulated in several
cancers such as prostate cancer, cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma, colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer [1115]. SIRT1 is also overexpressed in non-melanoma skin
cancers, including squamous and basal cell carcinomas,
actinic keratosis, and especially in Bowen’s disease [16].
Further, the overexpression of SIRT1 has been linked to
poor disease prognosis and survival in variety of cancers
[17-19]. However, the role of SIRT1 is quite puzzling as
there is an ongoing debate regarding its role as a tumor
suppressor versus tumor promoter [20]. This makes it
more important to study, in detail, the downstream targets
of SIRT1.
Quantitative proteomics is an enthralling approach
to acquire quantitative information regarding proteome
changes and offers promise in unveiling the complex
molecular events in tumorigenesis, identification of cancer
biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets [21, 22]. Gel free
quantitative proteomics approaches are becoming more
popular because of improved accuracy of nanoLC-MS/
MS as well as advances in data analysis software which
can expedite large scale data analysis. In this study, we
employed gel-free quantitative proteomics to identify
downstream targets of SIRT1 in melanoma.

Uniprot human database search revealed changes in a
number of proteins (Supplementary Table 1). The results
were highly reproducible as all three biological replicates
produced similar results. The changes in proteins were
accepted based on >95% probability with 2 unique
peptides. In summary, total 1091 proteins were detected
by Scaffold software in vehicle control (T0) and tenovin-1
(25 µM; T25) treated groups. Among these, 20 proteins
showed 95% confidence interval (CI) with statistically
significant differences (Supplementary Table 1). These
significantly modulated proteins were subjected for Gene
Ontology (GO) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Of
these 20 proteins, we selected 13 proteins (with >2 fold
differences) for further validation by qRT-PCR analysis.
These proteins were PSAP, HIST1H4A, MYO1B,
BUB3, MOCOS, MTHFD1, TROVE2, TOMM22, HTT,
RPS13, VDAC1, LMNA and CALM1. The details about
these proteins including accession number, molecular
weight and statistical analyses are provided in Fig.
1A. Interestingly, after tenovin-1 treatment, two of
these proteins, HIST1H4A and TOMM22, appeared as
new proteins, whereas, one protein HTT was found to
disappear. The proteome profile of the fold change and
direction of protein modulations are represented in Fig.
1B.

Gene ontology analysis of proteome changes
In order to obtain a global picture of proteome
changes following tenovin-1 treatment, we subjected
our proteomics data to GO database and PANTHER
(Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships)
classification to further categorize them according to their
biological processes, molecular functions and protein
classes (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2A, the largest fraction
of identified proteins belonged to cellular metabolism.
This is not surprising as dysregulated cellular metabolism
is a hallmark of cancer cells, and SIRT1 has been shown
to affect metabolic processes [23]. Other major groups of
proteins that showed changes included cellular component
organization, biological organization, cell death, and cell
cycle (Fig. 2A). Similarly, molecular function ontology
identified binding, catalytic and structural molecule
activity as the primary protein function; followed by
other activities such as enzyme regulation, ion channel,
motor, receptor, and transcription regulation (Fig. 2B).
Further, protein class ontology indicated that the majority
of proteins belonged to nucleic acid binding followed
by oxidoreductase, enzyme modulator, hydrolase
and cytoskeletal proteins (Fig. 2C). The other small
percentages of modulated proteins fall in categories of
calcium binding, cell junction, oxidoreductase, protease,
receptor, structural, transcription, transfer/carrier and
transporters.

RESULTS
Identification of SIRT1 downstream targets in
melanoma by nanoLC-MS/MS analysis
The goal of this study was to identify the possible
downstream targets of SIRT1 involved in melanoma
growth and progression. Using quantitative gel free
proteomics, we analyzed the global proteome changes
in response to SIRT1 inhibition by tenovin-1 in human
melanoma G361 cells. NanoLC-MS/MS followed by

Pathway analysis for SIRT1 targets in melanoma
by IPA software

in cancer cells; which predominately affect the protein
degradation, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, cell
proliferation, programmed cell death and regulation
of other cell signaling pathways [24]. However, the
modulation of SIRT1 and its association with UBC yet to
be explored in melanoma and other cancers. Furthermore,
protein network analysis by IPA highlights p53 as a
central hub relating to MYC and other proteins from the
connectivity map (Fig. 4). A recent study has suggested
cooperation of SIRT1 with c-MYC in liver tumorigenesis
[19]. Overall, this connectivity map suggests that p53 or
p53-associated pathways are potential targets or effectors
of the bioactivity of SIRT1 in melanoma. This observation
is in agreement with the recently reported study by Lain
and colleagues who showed tenovin-1 as an activator
of p53, and work by inhibiting SIRT1 and SIRT2 [25].
Interestingly functional analysis revealed the connection
of p53 with BUB3, a spindle checkpoint protein, which is
frequently dysregulated in cancers [26-28].

We used IPA software (trial version) to achieve
molecular insight into the tenovin-1 mediated SIRT1
inhibition related proteome network in human melanoma
cells. Proteins with 95% CI showing statistical significance
among biological replicates were subjected for pathway
analysis and network generation. Fisher’s test was used
to calculate the p-values associated with the canonical
pathways. We identified 19 canonical pathways upon
treatment of G361 melanoma cells with tenovin-1 (25
µM), among which thio-molybdenum biosynthesis and
apoptosis signaling were the top hits (Fig. 3). Interestingly,
dysregulation of apoptosis is a major hallmark of cancer
cells, and it is not surprising to realize that tenovin-1
mediated SIRT1 inhibition may affect apoptosis signaling.
Employing the IPA software, we further explored
the proteins involved in cancer networks. These proteins
are highlighted in different colors (Figure 4). Moreover,
the protein-protein interaction analysis showed significant
interactions among modulated proteins. These proteins
formed a cluster where majority of proteins were
connected with Ubiquitin C (UBC), a polyubiquitin
precursor. This suggest that the majority of the modulated
proteins are involved in ubiquitination via interacting with
UBC as a process of post translational modification which
might be affecting final action of the protein of interest
(Fig. 4). Disrupted ubiquitination of proteins affects
normal functioning of cells and leads to dysregulation
of proteins that control cell growth and death. Frequent
alteration of ubiquitination process has been noticed

Real-Time qRT-PCR validation of identified
downstream targets of SIRT1
Our next step was to explore the identified
downstream targets of SIRT1 at the transcription level.
For this purpose, we included two additional melanoma
cell lines, A375 and Hs294T, in conjunction with G361. In
addition, we used two concentrations of tenovin-1 (10 and
25 µM) for validation data. cDNA was isolated from all
three cell lines treated with DMSO (T0), tenovin-1 10 µM
(T10) and 25 µM (T25). A minimum of three biological
replicates were used for final analysis presented in Table

Figure 3: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The proteins that showed significant change (95% confidence interval with statistical

significance) were subjected for IPA analysis. The top 19 canonical pathways were identified as significantly altered upon SIRT1 inhibition
by tenovin-1.

BUB family proteins as novel downstream targets
of SIRT1

1. Overall, we found that most of the modulated proteins
identified in the proteomics analysis did not seem to follow
the same trend at the transcription level, and were even
different between the G361, A375 and Hs294T melanoma
cells (Table 1). However, PSAP, MYO1B and BUB3
seem to follow the same trend as shown by proteomics
analysis in all three melanoma cell lines. Therefore, the
involvement of BUB1 and BUBR1, in addition to the
mitotic regulator BUB3 was the subsequent focus of our
study.

BUB family proteins play major roles in the process
of the mitotic-spindle checkpoint which makes crucial
decisions in the cell cycle [29, 30]. Therefore, as the
next step, we analyzed the effect of tenovin-1 on protein
levels of BUB3, BUB1 and BUBR1 in all three melanoma
cell lines. Control and treated cell lysates were analyzed
by immunoblot analyses. As shown in Fig. 5, tenovin-1
treatment was found to result in a significant decrease in
BUB3, BUB1 and BUBR1 proteins in melanoma cells.

less frequent correlations. The red color represents upregulated proteins whereas the downregulated proteins are shown in green. The uncolored nodes indicate additional proteins of this network that were not spotted by the proteomics analysis. The protein-protein interactions
are indicated by arrows. The shape nodes denote the protein’s function: enzymes (diamond); nuclear receptors (rectangle); transcription
regulators (oval); cytokines (square); transporter (trapezoid); and others (circle).

The expression patterns of these proteins were found to be
consistent even at the mRNA level in all three melanoma
cell lines tested (Fig. 5).
As tenovin-1 is not a specific inhibitor of SIRT1 and
is known to inhibit SIRT2 as well, we were interested to
find out if the observed changes in BUB family proteins
were due to SIRT1-inhibition, SIRT2-inhibition or a
combination of both. To accomplish this, we knocked
down SIRT1 and SIRT2 separately in G361 cells using
lentiviral shRNA approach. As shown in Fig. 6A, a
genetic knock down of SIRT1 and SIRT2 resulted in a
nearly complete inhibition of their respective expression.
Interestingly, we found that only SIRT1 knockdown
resulted in a decrease in BUB3, BUB1 and BUBR1
proteins, whereas, SIRT2 knockdown did not affect
these proteins (Fig. 6B). This suggests that under the
experimental conditions employed in our study, SIRT1
modulates BUB signaling in melanoma cells.

that 1) SIRT1 is upregulated in human melanoma, and
2) tenovin-1 mediated inhibition of SIRT1 resulted in
an anti-proliferative response in melanoma cells, which
is mediated by increase in p53 activity [3, 4]. However,
SIRT1 has been shown to modulate a vast range of
cellular activities [23, 31, 32]. Therefore, it is important
to try to identify additional downstream targets of SIRT1.
Such information could be useful in designing novel
strategies for the management of melanoma and possibly
other cancers. Gel free based quantitative proteomics
approach is a useful technique for identifying targeted
signaling pathways especially when changes in protein
expression can be related to physiological and biochemical
parameters that respond to the treatment of interest [21,
22]. Employing the nanoLC-MS/MS gel free approach,
1091 proteins were found to be modulated by tenovin-1
inhibition of SIRT1 in human melanoma cells G361. Of
these, 20 proteins had 95% confidence interval with a
statistical relevance. The analysis of modulated proteins by
GO and PANTHER classification showed that tenovin-1
affects proteins that regulate cellular metabolic pathways,
protein binding and catalytic activity, and nucleic acid
binding, and oxidoreductase protein class. Our findings
are interesting because on the way to tumorigenesis,
cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to fulfill their
energy requirement. Further, SIRT1 has been shown to be
involved in a large variety of metabolic processes [23].
In order to interpret the differentially expressed

DISCUSSION
The major objective of this study was to identify
the downstream targets of the class III HDAC SIRT1
in melanoma cells using gel-free proteomics. This is
important because overexpression of SIRT1 has been
reported in a variety of cancers, including non-melanoma
skin cancers [11-16]. We have recently demonstrated

proteins, predominant canonical pathways and interaction
networks were generated by IPA, which is based on
regularly updated database consisting interactions between
proteins selected from scientific literature. The most
significant canonical pathways (based on p-value) were
thio-molybdenum biosynthesis and apoptosis pathways.
Furthermore, as evident from the connectivity map, p53
was shown to act as a central hub related to most of the
modulated proteins. p53 plays a large role in the cellular
response to stresses and DNA damage largely through
transcriptional repression or activation of gene of interest.
p53 remains undetectable under normal conditions due
to tight regulation by MDM2-mediated p53 degradation
[33]. During cellular stress, p53 becomes stabilized and
induces cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair, or
promotes cellular senescence or apoptosis [33]. p53 is
extensively studied in cancer research, and p53 function
is often blunted by genetic mutations in cancer cells,
thereby leading the cancer cells to bypass cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis processes [34]. Our protein network data
showed the interactions of p53 with a majority of the
modulated proteins, as well as with BUB3. Since mitotic
checkpoint proteins play a critical role in regulating the
cell cycle and proliferation, we chose to further determine
the effect of SIRT1 inhibition on BUB3 and other BUB
family proteins (BUB1 and BUBR1) involved in mitotic
checkpoint regulation, especially at the spindle assembly
checkpoint (SAC), which ensures proper chromosome
segregation, anaphase onset and chromosomal attachment
to the spindle [35]. BUB family proteins (BUB3, BUB1,
BUBR1) together with several other interacting proteins
form the SAC and prevent the action of Anaphase
Promoting Complex (APC), and thereby stop early
anaphase entry and mitotic exit [29, 30]. At unattached
kinetochores, BUBR1, BUB3 and MAD2 interact with
CDC20 and inhibits the formation of active APCCdc20
[36]. The BUB1/BUB3 complex plays a role in the
inhibition of APC when spindle-assembly checkpoint
is activated and inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of
APC/C by phosphorylating its activator CDC20 [36].
This makes BUB family proteins (BUB3, BUB1, BUBR1)
important regulators of SAC formation and signaling. We
have found that SIRT1 inhibition leads to the depletion of
BUB proteins (BUB3, BUB1, BUBR1) that might result
in a dysfunctional SAC, and thereby cell arrest or, possible
induction of Caspase-Independent Mitotic Death (CIMD)
(Fig. 7). Kitagawa and Niikura have reported that cells
choose to undergo CIMD as a result of BUB1 depletion
to avoid chromosome mis-segregation caused by reduced
SAC functioning [37]. Our data suggest the involvement
of BUB family proteins in the anti-proliferative response
of SIRT1 inhibition in melanoma cells. The clinical
relevance of BUB proteins is yet to be revealed in
melanoma. However, BUB1 and BUBR1 inhibition has
been shown to enhance radiation sensitivity in pediatric
glioblastoma cells [38]. Additionally, overexpression of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

BUB3, BUB1 and BUBR1 proteins has been reported in
gastric cancer, clear cell kidney carcinomas and breast
cancer [26-28, 39]. Hu and colleagues recently reported
that BUBR1 is overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma that contributes to resistance to paclitaxel (an
anti-microtubule drug); and its knockdown was found to
restore sensitivity to paclitaxel [40]. Defective cell cycle
checkpoints are considered fascinating targets for anticancer therapies, especially due to the resulting disruption
in the mitotic spindle apparatus, which leads to cell cycle
arrest and subsequently to the induction of tumor cell
death [35].
Taken together, our study has identified novel
insights into SIRT1 signaling in melanoma by connecting
this important protein deacetylase with spindle assembly
check point proteins BUB3, BUB1 and BUBR1. However,
further validation is needed in appropriate models to
confirm our findings and expand on our observations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and treatment
G361, Hs294T and A375 human melanoma cells and
human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA).
G361 cells were maintained in McCoy’s 5a medium
(Corning Cellgro, USA), and Hs294T, A375, HEK293T
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Corning
Cellgro, USA) with 10% FBS (Sigma, USA) at standard
cell culture conditions (37°C, 5% CO2 in humidified
incubator). Cells were grown to approximately 50%
confluence, and treated for 48 h with 10 and/or 25 µM
tenovin-1 (Cayman Chemical, USA) dissolved in DMSO.
DMSO alone treated cells served as control.

Preparation of protein lysates
Following treatments, cells were lysed in 1X RIPA
buffer (EMD Millipore Corp., USA) containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA)
and 1 mM PMSF (Amresco LLC, USA) on ice for 30
min. The cell lysates were spun down at 10,000 × g for
10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was saved and the protein
concentration was established using the Pierce BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA).
The lysates were stored at -80°C until use for nanoLCMS/MS and immunoblotting.

Enzymatic “In Liquid” digestion
“In Liquid” digestion and mass spectrometric
analysis was done at the Mass Spectrometry Facility
1995

Oncotarget

(Biotechnology Center, University of WisconsinMadison). Briefly, 200 µg of methanol:chloroform
extracted crude protein lysates of G361 treated with
DMSO as vehicle alone (T0) or 25 µM tenovin-1 (T25)
were re-solubilized and denatured with 8 M urea in 50
mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) for 10 min. The samples were
then reduced by the addition of 25 mM DTT in 25 mM
NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) also containing 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.5) to reduce carbamylation and incubated for 15 min
at 50°C. This was followed by the addition of 55 mM
iodoacetamide (IAA) and incubated in the dark at room
temperature for 15 min; reaction was quenched by adding
8 μl of 25 mM DTT. Protease digestion was performed
with the addition of 100 ng/μl Trypsin Gold (Promega
Corp., USA) in 25 mM NH4HCO3. The digestion was
conducted for 1 h at 42°C then an additional 20 µl of
trypsin solution was added and the reaction was allowed to
proceed overnight at 37°C. The reaction was subsequently
terminated by acidification with 2.5% trifluoroacetic
acid and 8 μl (~13 µg) was loaded for nanoLC-MS/MS
analysis.

consideration for MS/MS.

Database search and protein identification
Raw MS/MS data was searched against Uniprot
human amino acid sequence database formatted to
include reverse sequences and common contaminants
[70,130 protein entries] using in-house Mascot search
engine 2.2.07 [Matrix Science, USA] with fixed Cysteine
carbamidomethylation and variable Methionine oxidation
with Asparagine and Glutamine deamidation. Peptide
mass tolerance was fixed at 20 ppm and fragment mass at
0.8 Da. Protein annotations, significance of identification
and spectral based quantification was done with help of
Scaffold software (version 3.6.3, Proteome Software
Inc., USA). Peptide identifications were recognized
if they could be ascertained at greater than 95.0%
probability as restricted by the Peptide Prophet algorithm
[41]. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein
Prophet algorithm, and only those proteins were accepted
showing >95.0% probability with at least 2 identified
peptides. [42]. Proteins with similar peptides that could
not be distinguished based on MS/MS analysis alone were
clustered to fulfill the principles of parsimony.

NanoLC-MS/MS
Peptides were scrutinized by nanoLC-MS/MS using
the Agilent 1100 nanoflow system (Agilent Technologies,
USA) connected to a hybrid linear ion trap-orbitrap mass
spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., USA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source.
HPLC was carry out using an in-house fabricated 15cm C18 column filled with Jupiter 4 µm C12 particles
(Phenomenex Inc., USA) and laser pulled tip (P-2000,
Sutter Instrument) using 360 µm x 75 µm fused silica
tubing. Sample loading (8 µl) and desalting were done
at 10 µL/min using a trapping column in line with the
autosampler (Zorbax 300SB-C18, 5 µM, 5x0.3mm,
Agilent Technologies, USA). Peptide elution used solvents
comprised of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and
0.1% formic acid, 95% acetonitrile in water (solvent B).
The gradient comprised of a 20 min loading and desalting
time with column equilibration at 1% solvent B, an rise
to 40% B over 195 min, ramp to 60% B over 20 min, rise
to 100% B in 5 min and hold for 3 min. The column was
then re-equilibrated at 1% solvent B for 30 min. The flow
rate for peptide elution and re-equilibration was 200 nl/
min. The LTQ-Orbitrap was set to obtain MS/MS spectra
in data-dependent mode as follows: MS survey scans from
m/z 300 to 2000 were accumulated in centroid mode at
100,000 resolving power. MS/MS spectra were saved on
the 5 most-abundant signals in each survey scan. Dynamic
exclusion was used to amplify dynamic range and increase
peptide identifications. This feature omitted precursors up
to 0.55 m/z below and 1.05 m/z above earlier selected
precursors. Precursors remained on the exclusion list
for 40 sec. Singly-charged ions and ions for which the
charge state could not be allotted were excluded from
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Pathway and protein-protein interaction analysis
The modulated proteins identified in nanoLC-MS/
MS were classified according to their Gene Ontology
descriptions using information from the GO database and
PANTHER (http://www.pantherdb.org/) classification
systems. The predicted protein-protein interaction
networks and canonical pathways were generated by
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software (IPA trial version,
Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com) (Qiagen, USA)
using inputs of gene identifiers, log2 fold-changes and
p-values between two-group comparisons.

Quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the control, 10 and 25
µM tenovin-1 treated G361, A375 and Hs294T cells with
the QIAshreder and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) and
first strand cDNA was transcribed with random primers,
dNTPs and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega,
USA). qRT-PCR was performed using the StepOnePlus
Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies Corp.) and
SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, USA) with first strand
cDNA, forward and reverse primers. Primers for VDAC1,
TROVE2, PSAP, MYO1B, TOMM22, MTHFD1, HTT,
HIST1H4A, RPS13, MOCOS, BUB1 and GAPDH were
selected from the PrimerBank database [43]. Primer
sequence for BUB3, BUBR1, LMNA and CALM1 were
1996

Oncotarget

selected from respective references [39, 40, 44, 45].
All the primer sequences used in this study are listed in
Supplementary Table 2. The PCR program was set as:
initial denaturation step (95°C for 30 s) followed by DNA
amplification (95°C for 3 s followed by 61°C for 30 s)
for 40 cycle. Melt curve analysis was performed to ensure
the specificity of target amplicon. GAPDH was used as
an endogenous control and ΔΔCT algorithm was used for
relative quantification of target amplicons.

way to tell if the abundances are different between the
treated (T25) and DMSO control (T0) groups. The results
of a t-test are reported as the probability (p-value) that
this distance between means could occur by chance. The
qRT-PCR data were analyzed using StepOne Software
v2.2 RQ Study (Life Technologies Corp.) and exported
as RQmax and RQmin (2-ΔΔCt +/- ΔΔCt SD) which represent
relative quantity for gene of interest. For the analysis
of immunoblots, densitometry was accomplished using
Kodak Image Station 4000MM (Carestream Health, Inc.,
USA) and normalized to β-actin loading control. Further,
statistical analyses on biological replicates of qRT-PCR
and immunoblot data were performed with GraphPad
Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA) using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Dunnett’s multiple comparison test.

Lentiviral production and generation of stable
SIRT1 and SIRT2-knockdown G361 cells
Virus particles were produced by transfection of
HEK293T cells with control vector shRNA (pLKO.1,
SHC002), SIRT1 shRNA (TRCN0000018983, Clone
ID: NM_012238.3-1958s1c1) and SIRT2 shRNA
(TRCN0000040218, Clone ID: NM_012237.2-1739s1c1)
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) using the CaPO4 method as
described previously [46]. The virus-containing medium
was harvested at 72 h following transfection, and filtered
using a 0.45 µm filter (Millipore, USA). For target cell
transduction, G361 cells were passaged to 40% confluence
in a six well plate, and viral media was added to the cells
with 8 μg/ml polybrene four times over two days. After
72 h of transduction, viral media was replaced with
selection media containing 2 µg/mL puromycin. The
cells were cultured for 3 weeks in 2 μg/ml puromycin
for stable clone selection. Transduction of G361 cells
with the shRNA-expression plasmids resulted in the cell
lines G361-shSIRT1 and G361-shSIRT2, respectively. A
nonsense encoding G361-shNS served as a control. SIRT1
and SIRT2 specific knockdown was confirmed in stable
cells using immunoblot analysis.

Immunoblotting
For immunoblot analysis, 40 μg protein was
subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane and blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in 1X
TBST buffer. The membrane was probed with SIRT1,
SIRT2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), BUB3, BUB1
or BUBR1 (Abcam, USA) primary antibodies followed
by appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and
analyzed by chemiluminescent detection system (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). The blots were re-probed
with β–actin (Cell Signaling, USA), a reference protein to
demonstrate equal loading of protein samples.
