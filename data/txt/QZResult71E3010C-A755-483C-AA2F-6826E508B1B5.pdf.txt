ABSTRACT
The Kruppel-like protein ZNF224 is a co-factor of the Wilms’ tumor 1 protein, WT1.
We have previously shown that ZNF224 exerts a specific proapoptotic role in chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cells and contributes to cytosine arabinosideinduced apoptosis, by modulating WT1-dependent transcription of apoptotic genes.
Here we demonstrate that ZNF224 gene expression is down-regulated both in BCRABL positive cell lines and in primary CML samples and is restored after imatinib and
second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment. We also show that WT1,
whose expression is positively regulated by BCR-ABL, represses transcription of
the ZNF224 gene. Finally, we report that ZNF224 is significantly down-regulated
in patients with BCR-ABL positive chronic phase-CML showing poor response or
resistance to imatinib treatment as compared to high-responder patients. Taken as a
whole, our data disclose a novel pathway activated by BCR-ABL that leads to inhibition
of apoptosis through the ZNF224 repression. ZNF224 could thus represent a novel
promising therapeutic target in CML.

INTRODUCTION

[5]. WT1 plays an oncogenic role in a wide range of solid
tumors and hematopoietic malignancies, including chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) [6-8]. More in detail,
WT1 exerts anti-apoptotic functions in leukemic cells
by controlling the expression of several apoptotic genes,
including proapoptotic bcl-2 family members [9, 10] and
the anti-apoptotic genes A1/Bfl-1 [11] and bag3 [12]. In a
previous study we were able to demonstrate that ZNF224
acts as a co-activator of WT1(-KTS) in the regulation
of proapoptotic genes and suppresses WT1-mediated
transactivation of antiapoptotic genes in the CML-derived
cell line K562, thus pointing to a role for ZNF224/WT1(KTS) interaction in leukemia. We also demonstrated that
ZNF224 plays a relevant role in ara-C-induced apoptosis
of leukemia cells [13].
CML is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized
by the BCR-ABL gene rearrangement. The BCR-ABL
oncoprotein possesses an ABL tyrosine kinase domain
that is constitutively activated [14] and supports malignant

The Kruppel-like zinc-finger protein ZNF224
was initially identified as the transcriptional repressor
of the human aldolase gene [1]. Similarly to other zinc
finger proteins containing the KRAB repressor domain,
ZNF224 recruits, through its KRAB domain, the KAP1
co-repressor complex containing histone deacetylases and
enzyme activities modifying chromatin to repress gene
transcription [2, 3]. The arginine methyltransferase type
II, PRMT5, was identified as an additional component of
the ZNF224 transcriptional repression complex, which
mediates methylation of arginine 3 of histone H4 in the
nucleosomes surrounding the promoter region, thus
eliciting the repression of gene expression [4].
More recently, our findings have highlighted the
role of ZNF224 as a transcriptional co-factor of the
Wilms’ tumour protein 1, WT1, that is achieved through
the interaction of ZNF224 with the WT1(-KTS) isoform

trasformation by activating multiple signal transduction
pathways that promote uncontrolled cell proliferation
[15], abnormal cell adhesion [16] and resistance to many
apoptotic stimuli induced by antileukemic drugs [17, 18].
Nevertheless, the antiapoptotic pathways triggered by
BCR-ABL are still poorly understood.
Our previous findings prompted us to investigate
the effects of imatinib and second generation tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) dasatinib and nilotinib on
ZNF224 expression levels and to identify the molecular
mechanisms of ZNF224 down-regulation in CML cells.
In this study we demonstrate that inhibition of BCR-ABL
tyrosine kinase activity, induced by imatinib, triggers the
up-regulation of ZNF224 expression at the transcriptional
level. Moreover, we show that WT1 is involved in the
transcriptional repression of ZNF224 in BCR-ABL
expressing cells, in accordance with a recent finding
indicating that WT1 is a BCR-ABL survival factor and
its expression is induced via the phosphatidylinositol-3
kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway [19]. Finally, we found a
correlation between ZNF224 mRNA expression levels
and responsiveness to imatinib therapy in patients with
BCR-ABL positive chronic phase CML (CP-CML).
This suggests that ZNF224 could be exploited as a novel
predictive factor for imatinib response in CML patients.

ZNF224 expression is down-regulated in BCRABL positive cell lines and CD34+ primary cells
derived from CML patients
To address whether BCR-ABL expression is
associated with down-regulation of ZNF224, we initially
measured ZNF224 mRNA levels in leukemia cell lines
(K562, BV173, LAMA84) derived from CML patients, in
CD34+ primary bone marrow cells derived from 10 CML
patients at diagnosis, all characterized by the presence of
BCR-ABL fusion gene, or in BCR-ABL negative cell lines
(KG1, UT7) derived from patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). As shown in Figure 1, the expression
levels of ZNF224 were significantly lower in BCR-ABL
positive cell lines as well as in CD34+ primary cells from
CML patients with respect to BCR-ABL negative cell
lines.

TKIs induce expression of ZNF224 in BCR/ABL
positive cell lines
To investigate the functional activity of BCRABL on ZNF224 expression, we treated K562 cells with
increasing concentrations of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor
imatinib for 24, 48 and 72 h, after which annexin assay

was performed to evaluate apoptosis, and ZNF224
mRNA levels were measured (Figure 2). As expected,
annexin positivity was induced by imatinib in a dose
and time-dependent manner (Figure 2a); interestingly,
we observed that exposure of K562 cells to imatinib
also resulted in a time and dose-dependent up-regulation
of ZNF224 mRNA expression (Figure 2b). To evaluate
whether ZNF224 expression was selectively induced by
BCR-ABL inhibition, thus excluding that it occurred as
consequence of apoptotic machinery activation, we treated
K562 cells with topoisomerase inhibitors etoposide and

camptothecin and with a PKC inhibitor, staurosporine.
As expected, treatment with each of these three drugs
induced apoptosis, as revealed by the increased annexin-V
binding (Figure 2c), whereas no upregulation of ZNF224
expression was observed (Figure 2d), thus indicating that
ZNF224 expression is specifically related to BCR-ABLinhibition.
To provide additional evidence that BCR-ABL
signaling represses ZNF224 expression we used the
BCR-ABLpos cell line KCL22-S and its imatinib-resistant
counterpart KCL22-R. These resistant cells are no longer

dependent on oncogenic BCR-ABL kinase activity
for survival, and thus imatinib at high concentration (5
µM) suppresses BCR-ABL activity, without affecting
their viability [20]. KCL22-S and KCL22-R cells
were treated with 5 µM imatinib for 48h after which
apoptosis and ZNF224 expression were analyzed. As
expected, imatinib was able to induce annexin positivity
only in the sensitive (Figure 3a), and not in the resistant
KCL22 cell line (Figure 3c). On the contrary, imatinib
was able to induce ZNF224 mRNA expression (Figure
3b and 3d) and ZNF224 protein (Figure 3e and 3f) in
both cell lines, correlating to suppression of BCR-ABL
activity in both sensitive and resistant cells [20]. We then
investigated whether ZNF224 mRNA expression is also
modulated by the second-generation TKIs, dasatinib

and nilotinib. To this aim, we exposed KCL22-S and
KCL22-R cell lines to either dasatinib or nilotinib (0.03
µM and 0.4 µM, respectively) for 48 h. We found that
both compounds were able to induce apoptosis only in the
sensitive but not in the resistant cell line (Figure 3a and
3c), whereas, similarly to the imatinib treatment, ZNF224
mRNA expression was induced in both KCL22-S and
KCL22-R cell lines (Figure 3b and 3d). Western blot
analysis confirmed the induction of ZNF224 protein by
dasatinib and nilotinib in both KCL22-S and KCL22-R
cells (Figure 3e and 3f). These findings further strengthen
the conclusion that increased ZNF224 expression follows
inhibition of BCR-ABL signaling, rather than being a
non-specific consequence of apoptosis induction. It is to
be noted that inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase activity

and the resulting increase of ZNF224 in the resistant
KCL22-R cell line are not sufficient to induce apoptosis,
thus indicating that concomitant mechanisms, hampering
the expected cell death increase, are responsible for the
resistance to apoptosis in these cells.

Similarly, ZNF224 induction both at mRNA and protein
level was observed only in imatinib-treated K562 cells
(Figure 4c and 4e) and not in imatinib-treated KG1 cells
(Figure 4d and 4f).
To definitively prove the role of BCR-ABL in downregulation of ZNF224 expression, we transfected KG1
cells with an expression vector encoding human BCRABL and with empty vector as control. Ectopic expression
of BCR-ABL in KG1 strongly reduced ZNF224 both at
mRNA (Figure 4g) and protein levels (Figure 4h). As
shown, a considerable increase in WT1 expression was
observed in response to BCR-ABL (Figure 4g and 4h),
consistent with a previous study showing that the tyrosine
kinase activity of BCR-ABL signals increases expression
of WT1 (19).

Expression of BCR-ABL in KG1 cell line downregulates ZNF224 expression
To confirm that ZNF224 increase is specifically
related to BCR-ABL inhibition, we exposed K562 (BCRABLpos) and KG1 (BCR-ABLneg) cells to 3 µM imatinib for
24, 48 and 72h. As expected, imatinib-treatment induced
apoptosis in BCR-ABL positive K562 cells (Figure 4a),
but not in the BCR-ABL negative KG1 cells (Figure 4b).

All together, these data demonstrate that imatinib
could hamper a BCR-ABL signaling-dependent
mechanism of ZNF224 repression.

5b), and then treated with 1 µM imatinib for 24 and
48h. As shown in Figure 5c, the basal ZNF224 promoter
activity was increased upon exposure to imatinib. In
contrast, imatinib showed no effect on pGL3-control
promoter (Figure 5c). On the basis of these experiments,
we conclude that imatinib, via inhibition of BCR-ABL
tyrosine kinase activity, increases ZNF224 expression
through a transcriptional mechanism.

Imatinib enhances ZNF224 mRNA expression via
transcriptional activation
We next determined whether the induction of
ZNF224 mRNA expression by imatinib is a result
of altered ZNF224 mRNA stability. K562 cells were
incubated for 48 h with or without 1 µM imatinib after
which actinomycin D was added to block de novo mRNA
synthesis. After addition of actinomycin D, the decay of
ZNF224 mRNA was monitored by repeated real time RTPCR analyses. Pretreatment with imatinib did not increase
the stability of ZNF224 transcript rather it was slightly
decreased, as indicated by a somewhat more rapid decline
following actinomycin D addition (Figure 5a). The same
analysis was performed in K562 cells incubated with 1µM
imatinib for 24h (data not shown). These results indicate
that imatinib modulates ZNF224 mRNA expression
by transcriptional activation of the ZNF224 gene. To
demonstrate transcriptional effects, K562 cells were
transiently transfected with the ZNF224 promoter cloned
in a luciferase reporter plasmid (promZNF224) (Figure

WT1 represses ZNF224 gene expression
Subsequently, to search for transcription factors
potentially involved in ZNF224 regulation downstream
of BCR-ABL signaling, we conducted an in silico
analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites
located in the ZNF224 promoter. Interestingly, three WT1
binding sites surrounding the ZNF224 transcription start
site were found. According to the fact that BCR-ABL
induces WT1 expression [19] whereas ZNF224 is downmodulated by BCR-ABL (see Figure 3), we evaluated
whether WT1 could be involved in the transcriptional
suppression of ZNF224 mediated by BCR-ABL. To
verify WT1 occupancy on the ZNF224 promoter and
the effects of imatinib on this binding, we conducted
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) in K562

using oligonucleotides flanking the WT1-binding sites on
the ZNF224 promoter. Results confirmed in vivo WT1
occupancy on the ZNF224 promoter that is abolished after
imatinib treatment (Figure 6a).
To investigate the role of WT1 binding on the
ZNF224 promoter, we introduced the promZNF224
reporter plasmid into K562 cells and analyzed the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

luciferase activity in the presence of increasing amounts
of the WT1(-KTS) expression plasmid. As shown in
Figure 6b, WT1(-KTS) was able to repress ZNF224
promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. We also
observed a progressive decrease in the levels of the
endogenous ZNF224 protein in K562 cells transfected
with increasing amounts of WT1(-KTS) (Figure 6c).
The transcriptional repression exerted by WT1 on
promZNF224 was confirmed by RNAi-mediated silencing
of WT1. K562 cells were transduced with two different
28230

lentiviral shRNAs targeting WT1 or a scrambled control.
Following transfection with promZNF224 we found that
WT1 knockdown leads to a considerable increase in
promZNF224 luciferase activity (Figure 6d).
Finally, to evaluate the role of WT1 on the imatinibmediated induction of ZNF224 promoter activity, K562
cells were transfected with promZNF224 alone or cotransfected with the expression vector for WT1(-KTS)
and treated with imatinib for 48h. As shown in Figure 6f,
WT1 over-expression effectively counteracts the induction
of ZNF224 promoter activity elicited by imatinib.
These results, in agreement with ChIP data, provide

further evidence that WT1 is an effector of the ZNF224
transcriptional repression induced by BCR-ABL.

BCR-ABL-mediated suppression of ZNF224
occurs via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway
The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt
pathway is one of the three major signaling pathways
constitutively activated by the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase
activity [21, 22] and it has been shown to mediate the
BCR-ABL-induced upregulation of WT1 expression [19].
Therefore, we expected that also suppression of ZNF224

ZNF224 expression in patients with chronic
myeloid leukemia

by BCR-ABL should be dependent on the PI3K-Akt
pathway. To investigate this issue, K562 cells were treated
for 16 h either with imatinib, PI3K inhibitor (LY294002),
dual PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor (BEZ235) or with the
mTOR inhibitors Rapamycin and Everolimus, after which
ZNF224 expression was evaluated (Figure 7a, left panel).
In agreement with data shown in Figure 2b, imatinib
increased the levels of ZNF224. Interestingly, ZNF224
mRNA increased following inhibition of PI3K or Akt,
while mTOR inhibition did not affect ZNF224 mRNA
expression, thus indicating the involvement of PI3K-Akt
signaling pathway in ZNF224 suppression. According
to previous results [19], we observed that inhibition
of PI3K or Akt, but not mTOR, resulted in a decrease
of WT1 mRNA (Figure 7a, right panel). To confirm
the inhibition of the PI3K pathway by LY294002 and
BEZ235, phosphorylation of Akt was analyzed by Western
blot; phosphorylation of p70S6-kinase (a substrate
phosphorylated by mTOR) was analyzed to confirm the
efficacy of BEZ235, Rapamycin and Everolimus (Figure
7b). Furthermore, by inhibiting mRNA synthesis with
actinomycin D we showed that PI3K signaling did not
significantly affect the ZNF224 mRNA stability (Figure
7c), as already observed after treatment with imatinib
(Figure 5a).
These data provide evidence that BCR-ABLmediated suppression of ZNF224 expression is dependent
on the PI3K pathway, via the transcriptional repression
exerted by WT1 on ZNF224 gene expression.

Finally, we analyzed ZNF224 mRNA expression in
peripheral mononuclear cells from 30 adult patients with
BCR-ABL positive chronic phase CML (CP-CML) at
diagnosis (Dx) and after three months (FU) of treatment
with imatinib standard dose as a first-line therapy. On the
basis of response at 12 months of imatinib therapy the
patients were clustered in optimal responders (15 patients)
and warning/failure responders (15 patients), according to
the criteria of Baccarani et al. [23]. Intriguingly, as shown
in Figure 8, at diagnosis ZNF224 mRNA levels in both
patient cohorts were significantly lower than in healthy
donors (HDs) (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, we observed a
correlation between the baseline levels of ZNF224 mRNA
and imatinib responsiveness. In fact, at diagnosis optimal
responders showed ZNF224 mRNA levels significantly
higher than warning/failure responders (p = 0.039) while
at follow-up ZNF224 expression was found significantly
increased in all patients. These findings indicate that
higher ZNF224 levels at diagnosis could correlate with
better treatment responsiveness.

DISCUSSION
The leukemogenic BCR-ABL fusion protein
activates multiple signal transduction pathways which, in
turn, may affect the expression of genes implicated in the

pathogenesis of CML [14]. One of the key mechanisms
implicated in the malignant transformation by BCRABL is represented by inhibition of apoptosis [21],
which may be triggered through the down-modulation of
different proapoptotic factors [24]. Some of these have
been recently shown to be indirect transcriptional targets
of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. Expression of Bim is
inhibited in BCR-ABL positive cells, due to inactivation
of FoxO3a, a trans-activator of Bim. Imatinib treatment
results in FoxO3a activation, induction of Bim expression
and apoptosis [25]. Likewise, it has been recently
demonstrated that BCR-ABL represses at transcriptional
level the lymphoid-specific transcription factor BACH2
through the suppression of Pax5 expression, a potent
trans-activator of BACH2 [26].
We previously showed that the zinc finger protein
ZNF224 is crucial for ara-C induced apoptosis of CML
cells. The pro-apoptotic effect of ZNF224 results mainly
from its role as a cofactor for the transcription factor
WT1; more in detail, we found that ZNF224 induction
by ara-C enhances apoptosis in K562 cells through the
down-regulation of antiapoptotic WT1 target genes such
as bag3 and A1/Bfl1 and the upregulation of proapoptotic
genes such as VDR, Bax and Bak [13]. Here we show
that ZNF224 expression is down-regulated in BCR-ABL
positive CML cell lines and primary CD34-enriched cells
from CML patients. More interestingly, imatinib and
second-generation TKIs nilotinib and dasatinib are able to
specifically restore ZNF224 expression. By investigating
the molecular mechanisms involved in the imatinibdependent ZNF224 induction, we demonstrate that
ZNF224 is an indirect transcriptional target of BCR-ABL.
Furthermore, we have identified WT1, whose expression
is induced by the oncogenic signaling triggered by BCRABL via the PI3K/AKT pathway [19], as a transcriptional
repressor of ZNF224 in CML. Similarly, WT1 mediates
BCR-ABL induced repression of the myeloid tumor
suppressor IRF8 [27].
Data herein presented regarding the role of WT1 as
a repressor of ZNF224 gene in CML could also contribute
to explain the mechanism leading to ZNF224 induction by
ara-C and the consequent apoptosis; indeed, our previous
observation that ara-C induces a down-modulation of WT1
in K562 cells [13] correlates well with the ZNF224 upregulation that we found following treatment with either
ara-c or imatinib. Our data, thus, lead us to hypothesize
that the distinct signaling cascades induced by ara-C and
imatinib could converge on ZNF224 induction through
the down-modulation of WT1. Therefore, the current
study represents a further advancement with respect to our
previous findings [13] and could contribute to shed light
on the mechanisms of ara-C induced apoptosis, that are
still largely undetermined.
In addition, our molecular data are suggestive
of a regulatory loop in which WT1, by repressing
the expression of ZNF224 gene, could prevent the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proapoptotic effect of the ZNF224-WT1 complex
itself, thus contributing to the WT1 pro-survival role in
leukemia.
Similarly to our results on WT1 and ZNF224, a
regulatory circuit was proposed between WT1 and Pax-2
in kidney development in which WT1 protein has been
shown to inhibit the expression of Pax-2 gene [28] that,
in turn, acts as a transcriptional activator of the WT1
gene [29]. Furthermore, WT1 and Pax-2 proteins are
able to form a molecular complex, that could affect the
transcriptional regulatory properties of the two proteins
[30]. The identification of ZNF224 as a downstream target
of BCR-ABL kinase activity may lead to important new
insights in the molecular mechanisms underlying CML.
Particularly, the development of imatinib resistance in
CML patients is a dramatic issue in clinical practice,
and a key topic currently addressed in CML research.
Amplification of the BCR-ABL gene or point mutations
within the BCR-ABL kinase domain are the most
commonly identified mechanisms of resistance to imatinib
[31, 32]. Our data strongly suggest that the induction of
ZNF224 expression could provide promising means
to circumvent imatinib resistance and to develop new
therapeutic approaches in CML.
Finally, preliminary data from CML patients suggest
that ZNF224 could be a novel biomarker at diagnosis to
predict the imatinib sensitivity in patients with chronic
myelogenous leukemia, although analysis of ZNF224
expression levels in a larger cohort of patients is required
in order to assess its potential use in clinical practice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
HEK293T/17 human cell lines were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Bio-Whittaker,
Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum, 100 µg/ml streptomycin-penicillin mix (BioWhittaker) at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines were
cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum and 100 µg/ml penicillin-streptomycin mix (BioWhittaker) at 37°C in 5% CO2. The KCL22-R cell line
was further supplemented with 1µM imatinib (kindly
provided by Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) every
48 h [20].

Reagents
K562 cells were treated with 20 µM etoposide
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), 10 µg/ml
camptothecin (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 µM staurosporine
(Sigma-Aldrich).

Oncotarget

The KCL22-S and KCL22-R cell lines were
incubated in the presence of either 5 µM imatinib, 400 nM
nilotinib (Novartis Pharma), or 3 nM dasatinib (BristolMyers Squibb Company Princeton, New Jersey, USA).
To inhibit different signaling pathways, K562 cells
were treated with either 1 µM imatinib (Novartis Pharma),
30 µM LY294002 (Calbiochem, Merck KgaA, Darmstadt,
Germany), 10 µM NVP-BEZ235 (Novartis Pharma), 50
ng/ml rapamycin (Cell Signalling Technology, Beverly,
MA, USA) or 1 µM everolimus (Sigma-Aldrich). To
investigate ZNF224 mRNA stability, cells were treated
with 4 µg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich).

for relative quantification.
TaqMan
probe-based
chemistry
(Applied
Biosystems) was used in other RT-qPCR experiments
to evaluate the expression levels of ZNF224 and
WT1. Probes for ZNF224 (Hs00273760) and for WT1
(Hs00240913) were purchased as Assay-on-Demand
(Applied Biosystems). The amplification reactions
were all performed in triplicates on an ABI Prism 7000
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Data
were collected and analyzed using the Sequence Detector
v.1.1 software (Applied Biosystems). β2-microglobulin
(Hs99999903) was used as reference gene. The relative
quantification of gene expression was determined using
the ∆∆CT method [35].
For PB samples from CP-CML patients and healthy
blood donors, BCR-ABL mRNA was evaluated as
standardized within the framework of the Europe Against
Cancer Program [36]. ABL (NM005157.3) was used as
housekeeping control gene. Results were expressed as
percent ratio of BCR-ABL/ABL on the International
Scale (IS) using a laboratory-specific conversion factor
(CF) [37-39]. All reactions were amplified in triplicate
on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems).

Samples from CML patients and healthy donors
After ethical approval and informed consent,
umbilical cord blood samples from mothers giving birth to
normal, full term infants, and bone marrow (BM) aspirates
from 10 adult patients with BCR-ABL positive CPCML at diagnosis, were collected after signed informed
consent. CD34+ cells were enriched as described [33,
34]. CD34+ cell purity was always more than 90% as
determined by flow cytometric analysis (data not shown).
Peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells from 30 adult
patients with BCR-ABL positive chronic phase chronic
myeloid leukaemia (CP-CML) and 17 healthy donors
(HDs) were collected after approval by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of the University of Naples Federico
II. Patients were enrolled from July 2012 in the Division
of Hematology at University of Naples Federico II, and
treated with the standard dose of imatinib (400 mg/d) as a
first-line therapy. In particular, for retrospective analysis,
we selected 15 consecutive optimal responding patients
and 15 warning/failure patients [23]. PB samples were
available from the patients at diagnosis and at the third
month of therapy.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean±SD. The Student’s
t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of
differences using the non parametric Mann-Whitney test,
with a p value < 0.05 indicating a significant difference.

Cloning of the ZNF224 promoter
A 1000 bp fragment of the human ZNF224
proximal promoter was amplified from human
genomic DNA using the KpnI Fw primer:
5’-ggggtaccccgttgcagtgagctaagatcgtgcc-3’, and the HindIII
Rev primer: 5’-gacctggatgcgtaacctaggagtgggttcgaaccc-3’.
The amplified fragment was cloned into KpnI/ HindIII
sites of a pGL3-basic vector.

RNA isolation, reverse transcription and real-time
PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. 1 µg of RNA was reverse
transcribed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription
Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
To analyze the expression levels of ZNF224 mRNA in
K562 cells treated with imatinib, etoposide, camptothecin,
staurosporine, and actinomycin D and in KCL22-S
and KCL22-R cells treated with imatinib, dasatinib
and nilotinib, real-time PCR was carried out in a RealTime CFX 69 System (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA)
using the SYBR Green I Master Mix (Bio-Rad) and
specific primers for ZNF224 [13]; β2-microglobulin
(primer sequences: Fw 5’-ccgtggccttagctgtgct-3’, Rev
5’-tcggatggatgaaacccaga-3’) was used as reference gene
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Transient transfection and luciferase-reporter
assays
KG1 cells were transiently transfected by
electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II System
(Bio-Rad). 10 µg of pcDNA3-p210BCR/ABL (kindly
provided by Dr. Thoas Fioretos) or 10 µg of pcDNA3
empty vector used as control were electroporated in 9x106
KG1 cells. A plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent
protein (eGFP) was used to determine transfection
efficiency. The electroporation conditions were as follows:
300 V, 960 µF, using a 0.4-cm gapped cuvette (Bio-Rad)
28234

Oncotarget

for each condition. After 48h, cells were counted and
stained for viability using trypan blue solution (SigmaAldrich).
K562 cells were transiently transfected using
HiPerfect Reagent (Qiagen) with either 0.5 µg of a
luciferase reporter plasmid containing the proximal
ZNF224 promoter (PromZNF224) or with 0.5 µg of
the empty pGL3-luciferase vector (pGL3-Luc), used
as control. Cells were co-transfected with 0.25 or 0.5
µg of WT1(-KTS) expression plasmid, or with the
pcDNA3 (0.5 µg) used as negative control. After 24h, the
transfected cells were treated with either 1 µM imatinib
for 24 or 48h, or with DMSO for 48h. To normalize the
luciferase assays a pRL-CMV plasmid (50 ng) coding
for the renilla luciferase was used. Luciferase activity
was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega Corporation, WI, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

(C19) (Santa Cruz Biotecnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA,
1:500), anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA,
USA, 1:1000), anti-Phospho-Akt Ser473 (Cell Signaling
Technology, 1:1000), anti-p70 S6 Kinase (49D7) (Cell
Signaling Technology, 1:1000), anti-Phospho-p70 S6
Kinase Thr389 (108D2) (Cell Signaling Technology,
1:1000), the secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit IgG
(H+L)-HRP conjugated (BioRad170-6515, 1:3000) was
used. For detection, an ECL western blot detection system
(Amersham Biosciences) was used. ZNF224 protein
analysis was performed using the anti-ZNF224 (T3)
antibody (Rabbit polyclonal antibody) (1) as previously
described [13].

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
Chromatin
was
immunoprecipitated
with
anti-WT1 (C19 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
immunoglobulin G (IgG Sigma) as previously described
[4]. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by
quantitative real-time PCR using a Master Mix SYBR
Green (Bio-Rad) and the following primers for ZNF224
promoter: Fw 5’-tgagtgtaatgctgcaggagtac-3’, Rev
5’-caatgcgtaggtccaggaaattc-3’; for PIM1 gene (used as
negative control): Fw 5’-taaagccggggattttcagcc-3’, Rev
5’-ccgcccccatccttttact-3’. At first, we normalized the Ct
value of specific antibody and control IgG with the input
values (∆Ct = Ct IpWT1 or IgG- CtInput). The fold enrichment
was calculated by the ∆∆Ct cycle threshold method
comparing the ChIP antibody signal to a negative control
IgG (Fold enrichment = ∆∆Ct = 2^-(∆Ct IpWT1-∆Ct IgG).
Results are representative of two independent experiments.

Lentiviral transduction of K562 cells
Two lentiviral shRNAs targeting WT1 pLKO.1/
WT1 shRNA 1 (TRCN0000040066) (Open Biosystems,
Huntsville, AL, USA) and pLKO.1/WT1 shRNA 2
(TRCN0000040067) or one GFP shRNA used as negative
control (both kindly provided by A. Sweet-Cordero,
Stanford University, Stanford, CA) were used for
lentiviral transduction of K562 cells. Lentiviral particles
were harvested after calcium phosphate transfection of
HEK293T cells with the respective shRNA constructs,
gag-pol and the RD114 envelope genes. For lentiviral
transduction, non-tissue culture treated plates were
coated with retronectin, 40 µg/ml (Takara Shuzo, Shiga,
Japan) and blocked with 2% serum albumin (SigmaAldrich) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently,
virus-containing medium was added and the plates were
centrifuged at 1000xg for 1h at 4°C. K562 cells (400.000
cells/ml) were added to the virus coated plates and
cultured at 37°C for 48h, after which 3 days of puromycin
selection (1µg/ml) was performed.

Analysis of viability and apoptosis by flow
cytometry
K562 cells were plated at a density of 2.5x105/well
in 12-well plates and were exposed to imatinib, etoposide
(Sigma-Aldrich), camptothecin (Sigma-Aldrich), or
staurosporine (Sigma-Aldrich). The relative amount of
apoptotic cells was determined by co-staining cells with
annexin V-APC (550474, BD Pharmingen, San Jose,
CA, USA) and DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
(D9564, Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described (13).
The percentage of cells within the population positive
for DAPI and positive for annexin V was determined by
analysis on a FACS Aria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences
Immunocytometry System). Apoptosis of KCL22-S and
KCL22-R cells was induced by imatinib, nilotinib, or
dasatinib. Apoptotis rates were evaluated by Annexin-V
Kit (BD Biosciences), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were analyzed with a FACS Calibur
(BD Biosciences). Cell number was counted in a Bürker
chamber and viability was determined by trypan blue
exclusion.

Western blot analysis
Total protein extracts were obtained as previously
described [13], resolved with SDS-PAGE and transferred
to Hybond membranes (Amersham Biosciences, NJ,
USA). Non-specific binding sites were blocked for 2 h
with 5% milk in Tris-Tween buffered saline (tTBS) (5
mM Tris pH 7.5, 15 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20), washed
three times with tTBS and incubated with antibodies. For
the primary antibodies anti-GAPDH (7-B) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, 1:1000), anti-β-Tubulin (Upstate, Lake
Placid, NY, 1:2000), the secondary antibody goat-antimouse IgG (H+L)-HRP conjugated (BioRad 170-6516,
1:3000) was used. For the primary antibodies anti-WT1
