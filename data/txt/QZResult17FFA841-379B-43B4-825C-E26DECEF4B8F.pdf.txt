Abstract
The accurate joining of DNA double-strand breaks by
homologous recombination repair (HRR) is critical to the
long-term survival of the cell. The three major mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways,
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-JunNH2-kinase (JNK), regulate cell growth, survival, and apoptosis. To determine the role of MAPK signaling in HRR, we used
a human in vivo I-SceI–based repair system. First, we verified
that this repair platform is amenable to pharmacologic
manipulation and show that the ataxia telangiectasia mutated
(ATM) kinase is critical for HRR. The ATM-specific inhibitor
KU-55933 compromised HRR up to 90% in growth-arrested
cells, whereas this effect was less pronounced in cycling cells.
Then, using well-characterized MAPK small-molecule inhibitors, we show that ERK1/2 and JNK signaling are important
positive regulators of HRR in growth-arrested cells. On the
other hand, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway generated an
almost 2-fold stimulation of HRR. When ERK1/2 signaling was
stimulated by oncogenic RAF-1, an f2-fold increase in HRR
was observed. KU-55933 partly blocked radiation-induced
ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that ATM regulates
ERK1/2 signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of MAP/ERK kinase
(MEK)/ERK signaling resulted in severely reduced levels of
phosphorylated (S1981) ATM foci but not ;-H2AX foci, and
suppressed ATM phosphorylation levels >85% throughout the
cell cycle. Collectively, these results show that MAPK signaling
positively and negatively regulates HRR in human cells. More
specifically, ATM-dependent signaling through the RAF/MEK/
ERK pathway is critical for efficient HRR and for radiationinduced ATM activation, suggestive of a regulatory feedback
loop between ERK and ATM. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1046–53]

Introduction
Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPK) play an
evolutionarily conserved role in mediating and amplifying growth
factor–mediated and mitogenic signals from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus (1). Three major MAPK pathways have been described; the
extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), the c-Jun NH2-terminal

kinase (JNK), and the p38 MAPK pathways. In addition to their
roles in regulating normal cell growth, all three classes are also
known to be activated in response to genotoxic stresses such as
ionizing radiation (IR) and UV light. The MAPKs seem to work in
concert to balance cell death with growth and survival. The JNK
and p38 MAPKs are largely associated with apoptosis, whereas
signaling via the ERK pathway is primarily linked with cell
proliferation and survival, and seems to prevent apoptosis.
Deregulation of the MAPK pathways is associated with genomic
instability and cancer.
Another highly conserved cellular process is the repair of DNA
double-strand breaks. Whether in response to naturally occurring
double-strand breaks from stalled replication forks and V(D)J
recombination or DNA damage induced by IR, the cell must repair
these breaks to maintain genomic integrity (2). Homologous
recombination repair (HRR) is one of two major double-strand
break repair mechanisms, the other one being nonhomologous
end-joining. Using the sister chromatid or DNA repeats as
templates, HRR produces a perfect repair of these DNA lesions.
HRR is associated with the repair of more toxic DNA lesions
occurring in vital areas of the genome (3).
In response to double-strand breaks, the cell triggers checkpoints that halt the cell cycle while a decision is made regarding
repair and survival, or death (4). Ataxia telangiectasia mutated
(ATM), and other phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–like kinases
(PIKK) such as ATR (ATM- and RAD3-related kinase), and DNAdependent protein kinase catalytic subunit are the primary DNA
damage sensors that, together with the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1
complex, initiate the damage response, trigger cell cycle checkpoints, and coordinate DNA repair. Upon DNA damage or
alterations in chromatin structure, ATM dimers are quickly
autophosphorylated on serine 1981 (5), thereby activating ATM
and leading to the phosphorylation of a number of downstream
targets, including H2AX, p53, CHK2, NBS1, hMDM2, SMC1, and
BRCA1 (2). ATM is physically associated with the double-strand
breaks induced by IR, restriction endonucleases, and V(D)J
recombination, and has been proposed to regulate HRR (6–8).
ATM colocalizes and phosphorylates H2AX (g-H2AX), rapidly
forming discrete foci at double-strand breaks in response to IR,
referred to as IR-induced foci (IRIF). Numerous other proteins
involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis colocalize
to IRIF presumably to coordinate these processes. Several members
of the MAPK family have been linked to the DNA damage response
and ATM-mediated signaling events. For example, low levels of
DNA damage can trigger prosurvival signals mediated by ERK1/2
phosphorylation (9); p38g MAPK triggers G2-M arrest in response
to IR in an ATM-dependent manner (10); and JNK activation has
been shown to promote base excision repair of cisplatin DNA

lesions (11). However, little is known about the role of MAPKs in
the repair of double-strand breaks. This report shows that all three
major MAPK pathways regulate HRR in human cancer cells. Most
importantly, ERK1/2 signaling is a positive, ATM-dependent
regulator of HRR, and phosphorylated (S1981) [phospho-(S1981)]
ATM foci formation in response to IR critically depends on MAP/
ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK signaling.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Antibodies used were as follows: phospho-(T202/Y204) ERK1/
2, phospho-(S63) c-Jun, ERK2, h-actin, estrogen receptor (ER) antibodies
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-(S1981)
ATM, phospho-(S133) cyclic AMP–responsive element binding protein
(CREB), and phospho-(S15) p53 antibodies were from Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Anti-p53 (Ab-6) antibody came from
EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA), and g-H2AX antibody was from Trevigen
(Gaithersburg, MD). SB203580 and PD98059 were purchased from EMD
Biosciences, and SP600125 was from A.G. Scientific, Inc. (San Diego, CA).
PD184352 has been described (12). KU-55933 was kindly donated by Graeme
Smith (KuDOS Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom; ref. 13).
All drugs were dissolved in DMSO, except 4-hydroxytamoxifen (EMD
Biosciences) that was dissolved in ethanol.
Cell culture and treatments. Human malignant glioma U87/DR-GFP
(p53+) cells were cultured as described (6). The Ad-SceI-NG and AdCMVEGFP adenoviruses (6, 14) were added to the culture medium at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 30 and incubated with cells while slowly
rocking for 4 h at 37jC. U87/DR-GFP cells were infected with DRAF-ER* or

empty (pBabe-hygro) retrovirus (15, 16), and cell clones were selected with
hygromycin. Clones were screened for increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in
response to 4-hydroxytamoxifen by Western blotting. Cells were irradiated
with UV-C (254 nm) and IR (17, 18). Inhibitors were added to the cell culture
medium to the indicated final concentrations 1 h before treatment and left
in the medium throughout the experiment.
Western blotting. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were exposed to
antibodies at 1:500 to 1:2,000 dilutions. Specific protein bands were detected
and quantified using infrared-emitting conjugated secondary antibodies—
anti-mouse 680 Alexa (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or anti-rabbit IRDYE
800 (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA), using the Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System and the Application software version 1.2 from
Li-Cor Biosciences (Lincoln, NE).
Double-strand break repair and IRIF assays. The green fluorescent
protein (GFP) HRR assay has been described previously (6). The system uses
a DNA cassette that contains two incomplete copies of the GFP gene
separated by a puromycin resistance gene ( for more detail, see refs. 6, 19).
Briefly, the 5¶ copy of the GFP gene is mutated by an I-SceI restriction site
inserted into a BcgI site resulting in two in-frame stop codons and a
truncated, nonfunctional GFP protein. The 3¶ copy of the GFP gene is an
812-bp internal fragment of GFP spanning the BcgI site in the 5¶ GFP copy.
Thus, upon infection with I-SceI adenovirus, a single double-strand break
is created. Repair can occur by a number of mechanisms, including
nonhomologous end joining, homologous recombination (gene conversion),
and single-strand annealing. However, only gene conversion will result in a
functional GFP (19) because the internal GFP fragment does not have an
intact 3¶ portion of the GFP gene single-strand annealing would not result in
a functional GFP. In the IRIF assay, U87/DR-GFP cells were grown on glass

Figure 2. Inhibition of MAPK signaling affects HRR. Arrested U87/DR-GFP cells were infected with Ad-Sce I-NG. Four hours after infection, cells were treated with
MAPK inhibitors, and 48 h after infection triplicate data sets were analyzed by GFP FACS to determine HRR. Parallel cell cultures were collected for Western blot
analysis to determine drug efficacy. Fold depicts phosphoprotein levels normalized to ERK2 protein levels. A, PD98059 (10 Amol/L) and PD184352 (3 Amol/L) reduce

Results
ATM kinase–specific small-molecule inhibitor KU-55933
blocks HRR. The I-SceI–based DNA double-strand break repair
assay is now widely used for the study of HRR in mammalian cells
(6, 19, 20). Using this system, previous studies by our group and
others have shown that ATM is important for HRR (6, 21). Our
particular system results in the generation of a GFP-positive cell
when HRR occurs as a result of gene conversion, whereas repair by
single-strand annealing does not (19). To first determine whether
the I-SceI repair system would be suitable for assessing the effects
of pharmacologic inhibitors on double-strand break repair, we
investigated the effect of a small-molecule inhibitor specific for the
ATM kinase, KU-55933, on HRR (13). Many of the proteins involved

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

in DNA double-strand break repair also play important roles in cell
cycle checkpoint control (2). Therefore, U87/DR-GFP cells were
growth-arrested in G0-G1 by serum starvation before and during
the course of the experiment (6), thus facilitating a closer
investigation of double-strand break repair by minimizing the
interference of cell cycle effects. Cycling and growth-arrested U87/
DR-GFP cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing I-SceI
(Ad-SceI-NG) and treated with KU-55933. In line with our previous
findings using caffeine and dominant-negative ATM expressed
from adenovirus (6), KU-55933 inhibited HRR f40% in cycling
and f85% in growth-arrested cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1A). Serine 15 of p53 is a well-documented target for ATM
phosphorylation in response to IR (2). In agreement with previous
findings, serine 15 phosphorylation was completely inhibited by
KU-55933 in response to IR (Fig. 1B; ref. 13). The I-SceI–based
repair assay relies on the stable expression of the integrated DRGFP cassette and expression of I-SceI, in this case from an
adenovirus (6, 19). Transcription of both genes is under control of a
hybrid cytomegalovirus (CMV)/h-actin or CMV promoter, respectively (19). Conceivably, KU-55933 could affect expression from
these promoters either at the transcriptional or translational levels.
To rule this out, U87 cells were infected with AdCMV-EGFP, treated
with KU-55933, and relative GFP expression levels were determined
closely following the experimental procedure used for the HRR
assay. Figure 1C shows that KU-55933 did not affect GFP levels,
suggesting that KU-55933 inhibited HRR and not GFP or I-SceI
expression, or any other critical step in transcription or translation.
These results substantiate our previous finding that ATM is
important for efficient HRR throughout the cell cycle. Furthermore,
these results suggest that we can use this approach to investigate
the effect of pharmacologic manipulation of other protein kinases
on HRR.
Interfering with signaling through the major MAPK signaling pathways modulates HRR. ERK1/2 signaling has long been
associated with prosurvival responses after cell stress and radiation

ERK Signaling Promotes Homologous Recombination

(1, 22). To investigate a role for ERK1/2 signaling in HRR, we used
the well-characterized MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 and PD184352.
PD184352 is highly specific for MEK1/2 and is documented to have
no effects on other kinases (23). PD98059 likewise inhibits MEK1/2
but has been shown to also exert some inhibitory effects on ERK5
(23). Arrested U87/DR-GFP cells were infected with Ad-SceI-NG,
treated with MEK1/2 inhibitors, and the effect on HRR was
examined. When ERK1/2 signaling was inhibited, HRR levels were
reduced. PD184352 had a more potent inhibitory effect reducing
HRR by 70% compared with 40% with PD98059 (Fig. 2A). To
confirm that these inhibitors were inhibiting MEK1/2, parallel
protein samples from treated cells were assessed by Western
blotting of phosphorylated (T202/Y204) ERK1/2. We found that
PD184352 inhibited basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation almost completely compared with only 70% by PD98059 (Fig. 2A). Under our
starvation conditions, these drugs did not influence cell cycle
distribution when determined by flow cytometry (Supplementary
Fig. S1). This result suggests that ERK1/2 signaling regulates HRR
in human cancer cells.
JNK signaling is activated by DNA-damaging agents and is
believed to enhance DNA repair (11). Also, c-Jun colocalizes with
ATM and g-H2AX in nuclear foci (24). To determine the effect of
JNK signaling on HRR, growth-arrested U87/DR-GFP cells were
infected with Ad-SceI-NG, and JNK signaling was inhibited with
SP600125 (25). As was the case with ERK, inhibiting JNK severely
compromised HRR. In several experiments, HRR was inhibited
f80% (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis showed that SP600125
blocked UV-C–induced (S63)-c-Jun phosphorylation by almost 90%,
demonstrating that the drug performed as expected (25). These
data suggest that JNK signaling is important for efficient HRR.
Signaling via the p38 MAPK pathway is vital to the cellular
response to stress and has been linked to the regulation of
apoptosis and G2 arrest in response to UV and IR (1), which, in the
case of IR, seems to be controlled by ATM (10). SB203580 is a well-

documented p38a/h MAPK inhibitor (23); thus, this drug was used
to investigate the importance of p38 signaling in HRR. We found
that treatment with SB203580 enhanced HRR 1.7-fold (Fig. 2C).
Western blot analysis showed that SB203580 inhibited phosphorylation of (S133)-CREB and (S63)–ATF-1 by 80% in response to UV-C
in line with the literature (17). This finding suggests that p38 MAPK
signaling somehow dampens HRR, perhaps directly or indirectly
through downstream signaling events. To further investigate the
increase in repair observed when p38 MAPK signaling was blocked,
ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels were analyzed by Western blotting.
Strikingly, treatment with SB203580 alone was able to enhance
ERK1/2 phosphorylation nearly 2-fold (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Furthermore, inhibition of p38 MAPK amplified the effect of EGF
on ERK phosphorylation. ERK1/2 phosphorylation increased 3-fold
in response to EGF alone, an effect that further increased to 5.3-fold
upon the addition of SB203580 (Supplementary Fig. S2). A Yin-Yang
relationship seems to exist between p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 (26),
possibly explaining this stimulatory effect of SB203580 on HRR
acting through ERK. As with KU-55933, none of the MAPK
inhibitors had any effect on the transcription or translation of
CMV-mediated EGFP expression or cell cycle distribution of
growth-arrested cells (data not shown). Thus, the changes observed
in HRR are directly related to the inhibition of MAPK signaling.
Altogether, MAPK signaling affects HRR positively through ERK
and JNK, and negatively through p38.
Expression of oncogenic RAF-1 increases HRR repair. MEK1/
2 signaling is mostly associated with the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway
(1). To confirm that the events we were studying follow this
pathway, we expressed an oncogenic RAF-1 to genetically activate
this cascade and then determined the effect on HRR. A truncated
human oncogenic RAF-1 construct consisting of the activation
domain fused to the ligand-binding domain of the ER was stably
expressed from a mouse retrovirus (15). The ER domain carries
a mutation that makes it unresponsive to its natural ligand,

h-estradiol. Upon the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, a h-estradiol
antagonist, the ER domain undergoes a conformational change
exposing the RAF-1 moiety of DRAF-ER*, thereby triggering
RAF/MEK/ERK signaling (15). Hygromycin-resistant clonal cell lines
were established, including a vector control. DRAF-ER* expression
was evident in response to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). A consequent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was
observed in two DRAF-ER* clones in response to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Because 4-hydroxytamoxifen itself
is known not to result in DNA damage (27), and no ERK1/2
phosphorylation was detected in the vector control cell line, these
data strongly suggest that signaling originated from DRAF-ER* and
not from 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. S3B ). To
determine whether the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway
would exert a positive effect on repair, we again carried out the HRR
assay under the conditions described above. Consistent with a
positive role of ERK1/2 signaling in HRR, 4-hydroxytamoxifen
treatment and activation of DRAF-ER* resulted in an f2-fold
increase in HRR (Fig. 3A). Both DRAF-ER* cell clones tested gave
similar increases in HRR with 100 nmol/L of 4-hydroxytamoxifen.
In parallel, samples were collected and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
levels were determined by Western blotting. Relative ERK phosphorylation was plotted as a function of time (Fig. 3B). As expected,
4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment induced significant ERK1/2 phosphorylation as early as 2 h after exposure. Activation peaked at
24 h and begun to diminish by 48 h when HRR was determined.
Interestingly, 1 Amol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen induced much higher
levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation but had a lesser stimulatory effect
on HRR (data not shown), suggesting that overstimulation of
ERK1/2 signaling is counter-effective at the level of HRR. This result
corroborates the results with the MEK inhibitors. Taken together,
these data provide genetic evidence that RAF/MEK/ERK signaling
promotes efficient HRR in human cancer cells.

cells were treated with KU-55933 (10 Amol/L) or PD184352 (3 Amol/L) and

15 min. Fold depicts phospho-ERK1/2 levels normalized to ERK2 protein levels.

ERK1/2 signaling is important for phospho-(S1981) ATM
foci formation. As a single I-SceI–generated double-strand break
is not sufficient to trigger a substantial DNA damage response in
the U87/DR-GFP cells,6 we wanted to determine whether MEK/
ERK signaling is important in the IR-induced DNA damage
response. To address this point, we exposed growth-arrested
U87/DR-GFP cells to IR with or without PD184352 present (Fig. 4).
As previously reported (28), we observed distinct g-H2AX foci
in response to IR. We also observed significant phospho-(S1981)
ATM foci, which clearly colocalized with g-H2AX as indicated by
the shift toward yellow in the overlay (Fig. 4). However, most
striking was the near-complete abrogation of phospho-ATM foci in
the cells treated with PD184352 before IR. On the other hand, we
observed only a slight reduction in the formation of g-H2AX foci.
This finding not only supports a role for ERK1/2 in the DNA
damage response but also suggests that its role may be critical for
ATM activation and/or foci formation. A Western blot of cell
extracts from irradiated cells treated with or without inhibitors
confirmed that KU-55933 not only blocked IR-induced g-H2AX and
p53 phosphorylation but also reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by
60% to 75% (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. S4). PD184352 did not block
either p53 or H2AX phosphorylation in response to IR (Fig. 5;
Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that DNA-dependent protein
kinase catalytic subunit and/or ATR are able to phosphorylate
H2AX and p53 when the ATM kinase is inhibited. In addition,
flow cytometry showed that (S1981) ATM autophosphorylation
occurred throughout the cell cycle after irradiation, a response
that was compromised >85% in the presence of PD184352 (Fig. 6).
KU-55933 blocked ATM autophosphorylation >90% in line with a
previous report (13). Collectively, and to reconcile our findings, we
propose that MEK/ERK signaling is critical for the phosphorylation
of (S1981) ATM and/or the localization of ATM to repair foci, a step
that is expected to be important for efficient HRR that would
explain our results using the I-SceI repair assay.

Discussion

Figure 4. MEK/ERK signaling is important for phospho-(S1981) ATM foci
formation. Growth-arrested U87/DR-GFP cells were exposed to 5 Gy IR with or
without PD184352 (3 Amol/L) or KU-55933 (10 Amol/L) present and fixed after
15 min. Cells were prepared for confocal microscopy as described in Materials
and Methods and exposed to anti–phospho-(S1981) ATM and/or anti–g-H2AX
antibodies. DAPI staining shows nuclei.

HRR is considered to be most important in late S and G2 phases
of the cell cycle when sister chromatids are available. However,
HRR could potentially also occur between homologous DNA
repeats on heterologous chromosomes outside of the S and G2
phases (6, 29, 30). Approximately half of the human genome

consists of repetitive DNA sequences, and, thus, opportunities exist
for HRR outside of S and G2 although this would represent a minor
component. Double-strand break repair and cell cycle regulation
are intimately connected. Therefore, we used growth-arrested
G0-G1 cells to minimize indirect cell cycle effects on double-strand
break repair in our studies. The DR-GFP plasmid we used as a
target or template for HRR consists of two defective copies of the
GFP gene inserted in tandem between a stuffer DNA fragment
carrying a puromycin expression cassette (19), thus potentially
permitting HRR during all cell cycle phases. We previously showed
that in human cells with an integrated copy of DR-GFP, HRR is
detected in growth-arrested cells at f40% of the levels seen with
cycling cells (6). Similarly, Saleh-Gohari and Helleday detected HRR
events in G0-G1 cells albeit at lower relative levels than what we
have observed, and several recent studies showed that HRR occur
at RAG-induced double-strand breaks during V(D)J recombination
in G0-G1 (31–33). Furthermore, most if not all proteins necessary
for HRR are expressed in G0-G1 cells. For example, both ATM and
BRCA1 are expressed and activated by IR in growth-arrested

human fibroblasts (34). Therefore, HRR seems to function outside
of S and G2, perhaps by using different subsets of proteins (30, 31).
We previously showed that ATM is critical for HRR in human
cells using caffeine, a relatively nonspecific PIKK inhibitor, and by
the expression of a dominant-negative allele of ATM (6). In the
present study, we found that the ATM kinase–specific inhibitor
KU-55933 significantly reduced HRR at doses that inhibit the ATM
kinase. Interestingly, inhibition of HRR was seen under conditions
when ATM was not activated by IR or any other DNA damage
except for the single I-SceI–generated double-strand break,
suggesting that the ATM kinase is important for coordinating
double-strand break repair at the site of double-strand breaks even
at very low levels of DNA damage. In support of this idea, ATM was
shown to stabilize double-strand break repair complexes during
V(D)J recombination in growth-arrested cells (35), and we
previously reported that ATM is present at the I-SceI doublestrand break by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (6). We
observed an enhanced inhibitory effect of KU-55933 on HRR in
growth-arrested cells compared with cycling cells. This may be
because ATR or other PIKKs are available and can serve as a
backup for ATM during other phases of the cell cycle, especially
during the S phase. ATR is an essential DNA damage sensor and is
critical for HRR and the repair of double-strand breaks occurring
during DNA replication (36). Thus, we have confirmed in this study
our previous finding that the ATM kinase is important for HRR
using the ATM-specific pharmacologic inhibitor KU-55933 (6).
Irrespective of the specific mechanisms involved, our results
strongly suggest that RAF/MEK/ERK signaling is associated with
ATM regulation and HRR, and, clearly, the blockade of MEK/ERK
signaling has a major effect on phospho-(S1981) ATM foci
formation in response to radiation. Strikingly, in our study, ERK
kinase activity was required for ATM phosphorylation. However,
inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling did not affect IR-induced
phosphorylation of p53 and H2AX, which are both direct
ATM phosphorylation targets. This is probably due to redundant
phosphorylation of (S15) p53 and (S139) H2AX by other PIKKs,
such as DNA-PK and ATR (3, 37–39). In addition, ERK phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the presence of KU-55933.
The KU-55933 inhibitor was screened against a panel of 60 protein
kinases, including ERK, without observing any significant nonspecific effects (13), suggesting that the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by KU-55933 is ATM mediated. Our result is in agreement
with a previous study suggesting that ATM regulates ERK in a p53independent manner in response to DNA damage (22). However,
the mechanism by which ATM affects ERK signaling is not yet
known. Previous studies have shown a role for ATM in epidermal
growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor-IR signaling
and regulation (40–42). Conceivably, signaling could thus occur at
the level of an as of yet unidentified growth factor receptor that
would stimulate ERK. How ERK affects ATM activation is also not
known. Potentially, this could occur by direct phosphorylation of
ATM by ERK, but whether this is the case or not remains to be
determined. Recent work has shown that ATM activation is tightly
regulated by the actions of protein phosphatases PP2A and PP5
(43, 44), and the acetyl transferases Tip60 and hMOF (45, 46). Thus,
one possibility that could explain our findings is that ERK may
regulate ATM activation, nuclear transport, or protein stability indirectly through a protein phosphatase or acetyl transferase. Recently,
one study showed that MEK/ERK signaling was important for the
formation of ATR nuclear foci in response to hydroxyurea treatment, which resulted in DNA replication arrest and double-strand

break formation in the S phase (47). A similar mechanism could
link ERK and ATM perhaps through a feedback loop that might
regulate cellular homeostasis and sense the well being of the cell;
if DNA damage is repairable, prosurvival ERK signaling might
positively influence HRR, whereas overwhelming DNA damage
might inhibit ERK signaling and HRR. If this is the case, it could
be a possible mechanism by which ERK signaling intersects with
ATM signaling to coordinate cell cycle checkpoints and HRR. It
should be pointed out that this effect seems bimodal because it is
clear from our studies (data not shown),7 and those of others, that
the extent of ERK signaling is critical for achieving either positive
or negative effects on HRR, cell growth, and radiosurvival (1, 48).
Although the emphasis of the present work was on the role of
ERK signaling in HRR, we also report on the importance of JNK and
p38 signaling in HRR. These results are preliminary and serve as
controls for the results generated by interfering with ERK signaling.
Nevertheless, similar to the effect of abrogating ERK signaling
when HRR was examined, inhibiting JNK signaling also resulted in
an inhibition of HRR. Although this finding needs to be confirmed
by more detailed experimentation in future studies, it suggests that
JNK signaling is also important for efficient HRR in human cancer
cells. Keeping with the notion that ATM might be involved in
regulating JNK signaling important for HRR, A-T cells have
deregulated JNK/c-Jun signaling, c-Jun colocalizes with ATM and
g-H2AX in IRIF, and ATM has been shown to phosphorylate ATF-2,
which forms the activator protein-1 transcription factor together
with c-Jun (11, 24, 49, 50). Thus, the finding that JNK is important
for HRR fits conceptually with earlier work.

As a striking difference to the results obtained using inhibitors
aimed at ERK and JNK signaling, SB203580, the p38a/h MAPKspecific drug, stimulated HRR in growth-arrested cells. One
possibility for this enhancement could be that ERK signaling is
stimulated, as we have shown here. Other possibilities are plausible
as well. However, more thorough future studies may reveal what
role p38 might play in HRR and whether this is an indirect or direct
effect.
In summary, we have shown here that all three major MAPK
signaling pathways affect HRR. The role of ERK was clearly defined
as a positive regulator of HRR, whereas the roles of JNK and p38
seems to be positive and negative, respectively, and are currently
being investigated in more detail. We have also shown that
inhibiting the ATM kinase with KU-55933 reduced ERK phosphorylation, suggesting that ATM controls signaling through the ERK
pathway. Furthermore, a highly specific inhibitor of MEK/ERK
signaling compromised ATM kinase activity and severely attenuated the phosphorylation and localization of ATM to foci,
suggesting that ERK signaling affects repair protein complex
formation or stability, and/or localization of ATM necessary for
efficient HRR. Thus, ATM and ERK signaling could be under the
control of a regulatory feedback loop.
