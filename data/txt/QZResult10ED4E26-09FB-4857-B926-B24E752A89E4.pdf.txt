BACKGROUND: The authors sought to describe the age-specific impact of infertility and early menopause after
chemotherapy among reproductive age women with cancer. METHODS: A total of 1041 women diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18 and 40 years responded to a retrospective survey on reproductive health history. Five
cancer types were included: leukemia, Hodgkin disease (HD), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), breast cancer, and gastrointestinal(GI) cancer. Survey questions addressed acute ovarian failure (cessation of menses after treatment), early
menopause (menopause before 45 years old), and infertility (failed conception). Logistic regression was used to
determine the proportions of acute ovarian failure and infertility based on age at diagnosis. Censored data methods
were used to determine the probability of early menopause. RESULTS: Six hundred twenty women received chemotherapy alone. The percentage reporting acute ovarian failure was 8%, 10%, 9%, and 5% for HD, NHL, breast cancer,
and GI cancer, respectively. Acute ovarian failure increased significantly with age at diagnosis (P < .05). In subjects
not reporting acute ovarian failure, the incidence of infertility was at least 40% at age 35 years and increased significantly with age at diagnosis in HD and breast cancer (P < .05). The estimated probability of early menopause was at
least 25% at age 30 years and increased significantly with younger age at diagnosis in HD, NHL, and GI cancer (P <
.05). CONCLUSIONS: For patients to receive appropriate counseling, it is important that they understand the potential increased risk of infertility and early menopause beyond that of acute ovarian failure. These findings can provide
improved, age-specific counseling regarding reproductive impairment for young women diagnosed with cancer.

INTRODUCTION
According to 2006 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) statistics, approximately 120,000 women
younger than age 50 years develop cancer each year in the United States.1 Several studies have shown that loss of reproductive potential after cancer treatment can negatively impact quality of life in young survivors.2-4 Unfortunately, many
young women unknowingly face reproductive compromise.5 Whereas about 7% of women across the United States report
12-month infertility,6 the rates of infertility in young cancer patients are unknown.
Studies conducted to date on reproductive compromise have focused on the resumption of menses, which may have
underestimated the extent of gonadotoxicity.7 However, 2 additional phenomena, primary ovarian insufficiency and premature menopause, may compromise reproductive potential. Primary ovarian insufficiency (also known as premature
ovarian failure) can be overt (menses are absent, as in acute ovarian failure, or irregular) or occult (the ovary is damaged
but menses remain regular).8 Therefore, women may still menstruate, yet sustain partial ovarian injury that manifests as
infertility when attempting conception.

Original Article

The time period in a woman’s life when conception
is possible, her reproductive window, could be shortened
if chemotherapy or radiation causes damage to her ovaries
and decreases the number of viable eggs after treatment. It
has been demonstrated, for instance, that women who
continue to menstruate after treatment with chemotherapy for breast cancer remain at an increased risk of entering menopause early.9 Furthermore, evidence suggests
that early menopause could be a sign of a shortened reproductive window. Before the onset of menopause, while
menses are still present, subfertility often represents the
first manifestation of incipient ovarian failure.10 In
healthy women, fecundity decreases drastically about 10
years before the average age of menopause (51 years
old).11,12 Therefore, because cancer patients who have
been exposed to chemotherapy have a higher incidence of
early menopause, they may experience subfertility many
years before what is expected naturally, and thus have a
significantly narrowed window of opportunity for
attempting conception.9
We sought to evaluate the percentage of reproductive age cancer survivors who have experienced some type
of reproductive impairment, using a large and diverse
sample of women who have undergone chemotherapy
treatment for cancer during their reproductive years. We
examined reproductive impairment by cancer type and
from a comprehensive perspective, including women who
have experienced acute ovarian failure, who have experienced infertility, and who have entered menopause early.
Furthermore, we sought to examine the effect of age at
treatment on the proportion of women who have experienced infertility and early menopause after treatment with
chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We performed a retrospective survey study, using the
California Cancer Registry to sample women across the
state of California. All study procedures were reviewed
and approved by the University of California at San Francisco Committee on Human Research.
Subjects
A computer-generated randomizer was used to sample
reproductive age women from the cancer registry who had
a history of leukemia, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, breast cancer, or gastrointestinal (GI) cancer.
These cancers were chosen for study because they are common, nongynecologic cancer groups that can be treated

1934

with systemic chemotherapy. Patients were included in
the sample if they were 18 to 40 years of age at diagnosis,
and were diagnosed between 1993 and 2007. Among
6709 patients initially selected for the study, 4147
patients were excluded because their contact information
in the cancer registry was outdated. Letters were sent to
the primary physicians of each of the remaining women
before we attempted to reach the patients. Women were
then also excluded if their physician thought participation
in the study would cause undue psychological burden
(because of severe comorbid mental illness) (30 patients).
After exclusions, 2532 patients were contacted for participation in the study. Analyses of reproductive impairment
included only women who reported treatment with chemotherapy alone (ie, no pelvic radiation, pelvic surgery, or
bone marrow transplant).
Survey
A questionnaire was developed to query reproductive history before and after cancer treatment. The survey
included information about acute ovarian failure, infertility, and early menopause. Acute ovarian failure was
defined as amenorrhea for at least 1 year that began immediately after treatment. Infertility included only women
who resumed menses after treatment and was defined 2
ways. The first, 12-month infertility, refers to trying to
conceive with unprotected intercourse for at least 1 year
with no resulting pregnancy, and is the more conservative
estimate of infertility. The second refers to all women who
had tried to conceive but were unable and includes both
women with 12-month infertility as well as those who
tried for <12 months but were unable to conceive. Early
menopause was defined as entering menopause before age
45 years and therefore also includes women who experienced acute ovarian failure.
After an initial draft of the instrument was completed, 2 independent experts in survey methodology
assessed it for readability and content validity—the extent
to which our survey accurately assessed reproductive
health history. The survey was then piloted on 20 patients
from the University of California at San Francisco Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic and edited for ease of use
and readability before being sent to our study population.
The survey was made available in both English and
Spanish. A professional translation company (American
Language Services, Los Angeles, CA) was used to translate
the survey and recruitment materials into Spanish. Paper
surveys were created using Cardiff Teleform (Vista, CA),
an automated scanning utility, allowing patients’ answers

to questions to be scanned directly into a deidentified
database. An online version of the survey was also created
(www.surveymonkey.com, Palo Alto, CA), enabling
women to complete the survey online (in English or
Spanish).
Recruitment
Women were contacted between January 2010 and
September 2010. A contact letter was sent to potential participants, explaining the purpose of the survey and the
source of the individual’s personal contact information (the
California Cancer Registry), and allowing women to opt
out of further contact by reaching the University of California at San Francisco study coordinator. After 1 week, a second mailing was sent that included the written survey, a link
to the online survey, a written consent form, a postage-paid
return envelope, and an optional refusal postcard. Women
were asked to complete and return a written consent form
by mail and to return the survey by mail or complete it
online. Women who did not reply within 3 weeks received a
reminder follow-up phone call. Those who did not reply
within 2 weeks of the reminder call were sent a reminder
postcard with a link to the electronic survey.
Data Analysis
Survey data were merged with California Cancer Registry
data using a unique, anonymous identifier code. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Differences in diagnoses and
demographic characteristics between women who did and
did not respond were examined using cancer registry data.
Reproductive impairment was measured in those
who reported having been treated with chemotherapy
alone (ie, no pelvic radiation, pelvic surgery, or bone
marrow transplant). Descriptive statistics were used to
describe the percentage of women who had experienced
the following 3 types of reproductive impairment: acute
ovarian failure, infertility, and early menopause. The

Cancer

April 1, 2012

proportion of women of a given age at diagnosis who
experienced reproductive impairment was described 2
ways, and participants were separated by cancer type
during analysis to minimize heterogeneity of treatment
between different cancer types. Logistic regression was
used to estimate the proportions of women with acute
ovarian failure and infertility as a function of cancer
type and age at diagnosis. It was also used to generate
plots of the proportion of women of a given age experiencing acute ovarian failure or infertility. Censored data
methods were used to model the probability of early
menopause, as some women in our sample had not
reached our cutoff age for early menopause by the time
of the survey. Interval censored regression analysis was
used to determine the probability of entering menopause
early, based on cancer type and age at diagnosis.

RESULTS
Patient Sample
Of the 2532 women who were contacted, 1378 women
replied to our initial contact letter or survey. Of these,
337 refused and 1041 (41%) completed our survey.
Forty-seven percent of respondents completed the survey
online, and 53% completed it on paper. Reasons for
declining included: a request to be removed from all
cancer registry studies, no interest in further childbearing, the topic was too emotionally difficult to discuss, or
the survey was too long. The average time to complete
the survey was 26 minutes.
Table 1 compares all the women who completed
our survey with those who were contacted, but did not
compete it. Patients who completed the survey were
1.4 years younger at diagnosis than those who did not
(P < .001), and were diagnosed with more aggressive
cancers, as indicated by a SEER summary stage index
(range of zero [in situ] to 7 [metastatic]) of 3.7 versus
3.4 (P < .001). There were no differences between

responders and nonresponders in SEER socioeconomic
index (calculated from median income and education
for the census block group of residence at diagnosis,
P ¼ .8) or years since diagnosis (P ¼ .2).
Six hundred twenty of the 1041 respondents reported
having been treated with only chemotherapy (ie, no pelvic
radiation, pelvic surgery, or bone marrow transplant). The
age and childbearing desires of patients who were treated
with chemotherapy alone are listed in Table 2. Patients
with a history of breast and GI cancers tended to be oldest
at diagnosis and most likely to have had children before
treatment. Between 49% and 65% of women reported that
they would like to have had children after treatment. However, only 30% to 41% attempted pregnancy, and 9% to
24% were successful. These 620 patients who received
chemotherapy alone were used in our analysis.

For instance, the proportion experiencing acute ovarian
failure with Hodgkin disease was 0.06 at age 20 years and
0.3 at age 35 years (P < .001). For women with breast
cancer, the proportion was 0.32 at age 35 years and 0.55
at age 40 years (P < .001).
For women whose menses returned within 1 year of
treatment, the proportion experiencing infertility (defined
here by our less conservative estimate of infertility) significantly increased with older age at diagnosis in patients
with breast cancer and Hodgkin disease, and there was a
trend toward increase in women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Fig. 1, Middle). The proportion experiencing
infertility with Hodgkin disease treatment was 0.18 at age
20 years and 0.57 at age 35 years (P ¼ .007). For women
with breast cancer, the incidence was 0.32 at age 35 years
and 0.8 at age 40 years (P < .001).

Acute Ovarian Failure and Infertility
After Chemotherapy
The percentage of women treated with chemotherapy
alone who experienced acute ovarian failure was the lowest
among women with leukemia (3%) and highest among
women with breast cancer (9%) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (10%). Overall percentages of 12-month infertility
among women who continued to menstruate after treatment were 20%, 18%, 15%, 27%, and 23% for women
with leukemia, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and GI malignancies, respectively.

Early Menopause After Chemotherapy
For women whose menses returned within 1 year of treatment, the probability of experiencing early menopause significantly increased with younger age at diagnosis in
patients with Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
and GI malignancies, and there was a trend toward increase
in women with breast cancer and leukemia (Fig. 1, Bottom).
The probability of early menopause for women with Hodgkin disease was estimated to be 0.37 at age 20 years and 0.16
at age 35 years (P ¼ .043). For women with non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, the probability of early menopause was 0.56 at
age 20 years and 0.16 at age 35 years (P < .001).

Age as a Predictor of Acute Ovarian Failure
and Infertility After Chemotherapy
The proportion of women experiencing acute ovarian
failure significantly increased with older age at diagnosis
in patients with Hodgkin disease, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and GI malignancies (Fig. 1 Top).

reproductive impairment can significantly impact quality
of life long after cancer treatment. To make informed
decisions about fertility preservation at the time of treatment, patients should better understand their risk of
future reproductive impairment.

In this study, we demonstrate that rates of acute
ovarian failure alone likely underestimate the effect of
chemotherapy on reproductive function in women of
reproductive age. Previous studies have largely focused on
amenorrhea as a primary reproductive impairment outcome after cancer treatment.13 We have shown here, however, that chemotherapy is in addition associated with
infertility and early menopause, essentially narrowing the
reproductive window, even in women whose menses
resume after treatment.
The percentage of women reporting acute ovarian
failure after chemotherapy in our study is consistent with
previous work in our field. Among breast cancer patients,
the 9% experiencing acute ovarian failure in our patient
population is consistent with the rate of 7% in patients
younger than age 35 years reported by Kil and colleagues.14 In a prior study of 400 patients with Hodgkin
disease, 7% reported acute ovarian failure, compared with
8% in our study.15 The relatively low rate of acute ovarian
failure seen in leukemia is consistent with what has been
learned from in vitro models, where it has been suggested
that the agents used to treat the most common types of
leukemia portend the least gonadotoxicity.16 Our agespecific proportions of acute ovarian failure are also similar to those seen by others. For instance, 55% of women
who were 40 years old at diagnosis and treated with chemotherapy alone for breast cancer reported acute ovarian
failure in our study. This is similar to Goodwin and colleagues’ reported rate of approximately 50%.17
Although there is likely a significant biological component contributing to variability in rates of acute ovarian
failure among disease and age-matched women,18 we have
shown age to be a significant predictor. Our results, for
instance, demonstrate that women who are 40 years old at
the time of diagnosis for NHL are 3 more likely to
experience acute ovarian failure than women who are age
18 at diagnosis.
The majority of women who remain amenorrheic 1
year after treatment will not regain ovarian function.14,19-21
When women do not become menopausal at treatment
and continue to menstruate, infertility and early menopause continue to significantly impact reproductive function. Women age 18 years at diagnosis for non-Hodgkin
lymphoma have a 13% chance of acute ovarian failure; if
they do continue to menstruate, they have an additional
9% chance of experiencing infertility and 60% probability
of early menopause. It has been suggested that, because the
majority of women younger than 35 years of age treated for
breast cancer experience only temporary amenorrhea

1937

Original Article

because of chemotherapy, many of these women can maintain fertility.22 In contrast, we found that at least 27% of all
women with breast cancer in our study had infertility after
treatment, despite the presence of menses.
Literature regarding the impact of chemotherapy on
infertility is scarce. There have been numerous studies
showing that women with prior diagnosis and treatment
for cancer do successfully have children.23 However, there
is often no information on the number of women actually
attempting pregnancy. The percentage of 12-month infertility seen in all cancer types in our study was higher than
the 7% 12-month infertility seen in the US population.
Our results are consistent with rates of infertility seen in
the Norwegian Cancer Registry, in which 25% of 184
women with similar time to follow-up for Hodgkin disease and attempting conception were unable to conceive.23 Notably, modern treatment for Hodgkin disease,
which commonly includes AVBD (doxorubicin [Adriamycin], bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) or Stanford V (mechlorethamine, doxorubicin [Adriamycin],
vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin, etoposide, and prednisone), appears likely to have a significant and negative
impact on fertility, in contrast to previous reports.24,25
Our results suggest that fertility counseling for
women who are nearer to 40 years old at the time of diagnosis could be different from that for a woman who is 18
years old. For instance, there appears to be a 4- to 5-fold
increase in rates of infertility from age 18 to age 40 years
in women with Hodgkin disease. Seventy percent of
reproductive age women are concerned about infertility
after a cancer diagnosis, and almost 1=3 of women will
adjust their treatment plans based on fertility concerns.3
Our data could contribute to an improved ability to counsel women about future risk of infertility, based on predictors such as disease-type and age, and help to make more
informed decisions about fertility preservation.
Women concerned about future fertility should also
understand their risk of early menopause. Our results
demonstrate age-specific rates of early menopause in
women treated with chemotherapy for Hodgkin disease,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and GI malignancies. Consistent with the work of Partridge and colleagues, we have
demonstrated that the closer in age a patient is to natural
menopause at the time of diagnosis, the lower the chance
that chemotherapy will induce early menopause.9 For
instance, 18-year-old women with Hodgkin disease are at
a 2-fold increased risk of experiencing early menopause
versus their 40 year-old counterparts. Although there are
previous data alluding to the finding that younger patients

1938

exposed to chemotherapy are more likely to experience
early menopause, this outcome is still surprising. Such
results argue for the importance of counseling younger
women about their risk of a shortened reproductive window. The reasons that young women may experience
higher risks of early menopause yet lower risks of infertility and acute ovarian failure, although interesting, are
beyond the scope of this paper and likely relate to duration of time elapsed since exposure.
This study has several important strengths and limitations. The outcomes chosen are comprehensive and inclusive, and not exclusively focused on amenorrhea. However,
despite controlling for cancer type at diagnosis, lack of
clearly defined treatment type and duration for each patient
requires us to make generalizations and assumptions about
what chemotherapy regimens patients likely received. We
are limited to making reasonable inferences about treatment,
based on cancer type and practice patterns at that time, as
has been done by others with success.26 It is also possible
that other, unmeasured, factors may play a role in our findings. For example, women who receive cancer treatment
may postpone childbearing, leaving them older at the time
they are trying to conceive. Age is an important prognosticator, but not a perfect predictor of reproductive impairment.
Even within a given age group, prior studies have shown
wide variability in an individual’s ovarian reserve.18 Another
limitation of this study has been the use of a retrospective
rather than prospective survey, and using a historical cancer
registry in which patients may be lost to follow-up.27 Nevertheless, as the National Cancer Institute’s working group for
the improvement of care of gynecologic malignancies indicated, cancer registries offer an effective means of rapidly
acquiring large amounts of data for important cancer
issues.28 Our response rate was consistent with those
from previously published studies.3,29 This study of a cancer
registry has been most important in its ability to effectively
identify a large sample of patients to demonstrate infertility
as a missing metric in cancer survivorship research.
It is fundamental that patients understand their risk
of future reproductive compromise, a risk that may
include infertility and early menopause, in addition to
acute ovarian failure. Counseling based on the risk of
amenorrhea alone may give women an unrealistically low
perception of their total risk of reproductive impairment,
as we know that women can be menstruating and still be
infertile. Patients should be given a chance to make
an active decision about post-treatment family planning
in the presence of the most comprehensive available
information.
