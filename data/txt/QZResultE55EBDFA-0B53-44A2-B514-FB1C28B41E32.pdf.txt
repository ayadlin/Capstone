Cell Death Identiﬁcation in Anticancer Therapy—Response

We would like to thank Brown and colleagues (1) for their effort
and their valuable comments on our review about cell death
mechanisms in anticancer therapy. We understand their view on
assessing the persistence of clonogenic survival from quantiﬁcation of death records in anticancer research.
As it has been pointed out, the major form of cell death
triggered in a cell culture relies on the genetics of tumor cells and
is not equivalent to clonogenic survival. Nevertheless, the mechanism of cell death could provide signiﬁcant information about
tumor cell response. Indeed, when death records are accurately
collected, by including not only apoptosis but also necrotic events
and other phenotypes linked to less clonogenic potential (like
micro or multinucleated cells), they become more reliable and
close to clonogenic data (2). Furthermore, classic colony formation assays (when cells are extremely diluted prior to or after
therapy) cannot measure the inﬂuence of cell-to-cell or paracrine
communications, and its relevance decreases when used in settings apart from DNA-damaging agents (3).
In order to perform valuable clonogenic endpoints,
researchers should understand that the genetic background
not only modulates the type and rate of cell death, as Brown
and colleagues point out, but also determines the cell growth
rate. Therefore, endpoints and valid colony criteria should be
set appropriately to avoid confounding slow proliferation with
lack of clonogenicity (4).
Despite not being a cell death modality, senescence's relevance
in cancer biology is being increasingly recognized. Unfortunately
as a "permanent" condition, senescence is hard to study. Current

knowledge in cancer progression admits the existence of longdormant cells that can restart proliferation after years of latency
(5). Such a behavior is almost impossible to address in current
in vitro experimental settings.
To successfully eradicate a tumor from a patient requires,
besides cell killing, enforcing the abrogation of tumor regrowth.
It is assumed that a very little fraction (less than 10%) of tumor
cells are active clonogenic cells, but less consensus is met when
considering if those "cancer stem cells" constitute a phylogenic
separated population or are the result of a series of events of
stem genesis within the tumor cell population (4, 6, 7).
In our review, we advocate for an easier clonogenic endpoint
setting consisting of keeping the cell culture for a time after drug
washout to measure if the culture keeps dying, remains stable, or
regrows. This setting keeps cell-to-cell and paracrine communications in closer degree than what would happen in actual tumors
without inducing further stress (like trypsinization). In regrowth
situations, we advise to repeat treatments, assessing then the
possible acquisition of resistance. For authors who prefer colony
formation assays, our counsel is to clearly specify the conditions
of the experiments in their Materials and Methods sections and,
when possible, to try different settings: cell dilution prior to
treatment versus cell dilution after treatment (in this case being
sure that already dead cells are not being seeded) and fresh
medium versus conditioned medium (from a growing culture,
thus enriched with tumor cell secretion products). In any case,
endpoint times and cell number criteria for a valid colony to be
counted have to be stated.
We hope that both Brown and colleagues' remarks and our
comments help cancer researchers to better reﬁne their experimental in vitro settings to acquire the maximum valuable knowledge prior to embarking in animal testing.
