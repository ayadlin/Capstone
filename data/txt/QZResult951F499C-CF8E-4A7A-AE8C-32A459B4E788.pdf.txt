Abstract
Neuronal leucine-rich repeat protein-1 (NLRR1), a type-1 transmembrane protein highly expressed in
unfavorable neuroblastoma, is a target gene of MYCN that is predominately expressed in primary neuroblastomas
with MYCN ampliﬁcation. However, the precise biological role of NLRR1 in cell proliferation and tumor
progression remains unknown. To investigate its functional importance, we examined the role of NLRR1 in
EGF and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1)–mediated cell viability. We found that NLRR1 positively regulated cell
proliferation through activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase mediated by EGF and IGF-1. Interestingly, EGF stimulation induced endogenous MYCN expression through Sp1 recruitment to the MYCN promoter
region, which was accelerated in NLRR1-expressing cells. The Sp1-binding site was identiﬁed on the promoter
region for MYCN induction, and phosphorylation of Sp1 was important for EGF-mediated MYCN regulation.
In vivo studies conﬁrmed the proliferation-promoting activity of NLRR1 and established an association between
NLRR1 expression and poor prognosis in neuroblastoma. Together, our ﬁndings indicate that NLRR1 plays an
important role in the development of neuroblastoma and therefore may represent an attractive therapeutic target
for cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 72(17); 4587–96. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is one of the most common extracranial
malignant tumors that develop in children; they arise from
neural crest cells and are mostly found in the adrenal medulla
or along the sympathetic chain (1). neuroblastoma exhibits
clinical and biological heterogeneity, ranging from rapid progression associated with metastatic spread and poor clinical
outcome to occasional, spontaneous, or therapy-induced
regression or differentiation into benign ganglioneuroma (2,
3). Different subsets of neuroblastoma show various distinct
genetic features, including DNA ploidy, MYCN ampliﬁcation,
allelic loss of the distal part of chromosome 1p, and gain of
chromosome 17q (4). Ampliﬁcation of the MYCN gene usually
distinguishes a subset of neuroblastoma with poor prognosis
(1), and recovery of children with high-risk neuroblastoma
remains low, providing a compelling reason for better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that can be targeted to
treat this disease (5, 6). MYCN transgenic mice develop neuroblastoma, which implicates that MYCN can maintain the

tumorigenic state, supporting the importance of the MYCN
gene as a potential therapeutic target (7–9). However, the
precise mechanism of MYCN regulation and the functional
correlation with other proteins in the progression of neuroblastoma are still elusive.
NLRR1 is a type I transmembrane protein with extracellular
leucine-rich repeats, and belongs to the mammalian neuronal
leucine-rich protein family (NLRR1–NLRR5; ref. 10–13). We
previously reported that mRNA expression levels of NLRR1 are
signiﬁcantly higher in unfavorable neuroblastoma (12). We
further reported that NLRR1 protein expression is higher in
MYCN-ampliﬁed primary neuroblastomas than in nonampliﬁed tumors, and that MYCN can transcriptionally upregulate
NLRR1 (14). We also found that overexpression of NLRR1
promoted neuroblastoma cell proliferation and inhibited cellular apoptosis upon serum starvation (14). NLRR family proteins have also been considered as cell adhesion or signaling
molecules, and mouse NLRR3 functions in EGF-mediated activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK; ref. 15).
EGF signaling was reported to be involved in neuroblastoma
cell proliferation via the activation of ERK and AKT (16).
Insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I) stimulation was also reported
to enhance neuroblastoma cell proliferation, and is involved in
the induction of MYCN expression through mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK; ref. 17). MAPK kinase (MKK) proteins
are crucially important in several cellular events, including
proliferation, survival, and differentiation (18, 19). Several
stimuli activate MKKs, which is followed by activation of
MAPKs, including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Abnormalities
in MAPK pathways, especially mutations of proteins of these
signaling cascades, have been reported in about 20% of all

human cancers (20, 21). Several reports suggest that MKK/ERK
signaling has an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis (22–24). However, the precise role of MKK/ERK signaling
in the development of neuroblastoma and its functional relationship with MYCN oncogene are still unknown. NLRR1 is a
possible regulator of growth factor signaling, and may play a
crucial role in MYCN-ampliﬁed neuroblastoma to form aggressive tumors. In this study, we report that EGF promotes ERK
activation and is involved in MYCN induction via recruitment
of Sp1 to the MYCN promoter. Overexpression of NLRR1
enhanced MYCN induction by activating ERK signaling, whereas knockdown of NLRR1 suppressed ERK phosphorylation and
MYCN induction upon EGF treatment. In vivo studies in nude
mice showed signiﬁcant tumorigenic activity of NLRR1. Our
present ﬁndings collectively indicate that NLRR1 accelerates
growth factor signaling to induce MYCN, and plays a positive
feedback loop with MYCN to induce aggressive tumor progression in neuroblastoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, transfection, and reagents
Human neuroblastoma-derived SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y cells
were collected from CHOP cell lines and were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 mg/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/
mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 C. For transient
transfection, SK-N-BE cells were transfected with the indicated
plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
Cell proliferation assays
SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y cell proliferation was evaluated using
the tetrazolium compound WST-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8
Dojindo Laboratories, Japan). Cell proliferation was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was prepared from the indicated cells using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer0 s
protocol, and reverse-transcription was performed. The speciﬁc primers used were as follows: MYCN, 50 -CTTCGGTCCAGCTTTCTCAC-30 and 50 -GTCCGAGCGTGTTCAATTTT-30 ;
NLRR1, 5-GCAGCTTTTCAACTTGACTGAA-3 and 5-TGCAGCAGCTTTTCAACTTGACTGAAC-3; VEGF, 50 -AAGGAGGAGGGCAGAATCAT-30 and 50 -ATCTGCATGGTGATGTTGGA-30 ;
Sp1, 50 -TGCAGCAGAATTGAGTCACC -30 and 50 - CACAACATACTGCCCACCAG-30 ; GAPDH, 50 - ACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAA-30 and 50 -TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-30 . GAPDH
expression was measured as an internal control.
Immunoblotting
Cells were collected and washed with PBS. Whole cell lysates
were prepared by incubating cells in lysis buffer containing 10
mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L ethyleneglycol tetraacetic acid, 50 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, 1%

ice, and subjected to brief sonication for 10 seconds at 4 C,
followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 C for 10 minutes
to remove insoluble materials. Protein concentration was
measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc)
according to the manufacturer's instruction. Equal amounts of
protein (50 mg) were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) membranes (Immobilion-P, Millipore. PVDF membranes were then blocked with TBS containing 5% nonfat dry
milk and 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 hour. After
blocking, the membranes were incubated at 4 C overnight with
anti-MYCN (Ab-1, Oncogene), anti-EGFR (Rockland), antiactin (20–33; Sigma), and other antibodies against ERK1/2,
phospho-ERK, IGF1R, phospho IGFR1, Akt, phospho-Akt, and
phospho-EGFR were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. After incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled
goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Immunoblots were visualized using ECL detection reagents
according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham
Biosciences).
Construction of luciferase reporters
A luciferase reporter construct driven by the MYCN
promoter was generated by using the following primer sets:
MYCN (221/þ21), 50 - GAGCTCCAGCTTTGCAGCCTTCTC30 and 50 - GAGCTCGTCCAGACAGATGACTGTC-30 . Underlined sequences indicate Sac1 enzyme recognition sites.
Then, the PCR product was inserted into the Sac1 site of
pGL3 basic vector. Mutation of the 2 putative Sp1-binding
sites was performed using a site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Promega) using the following primer sets: mut-1 (221/
þ21), 50 -ACAGCCCCCTTCTCTCCCC(A)G(A)CCC(A)CCCGG30 (sense), 50 -GGGAGAGAAGGGGGCTGTGGCGCA-30 (antisense); mut-2 (221/þ21), 50 -ATGGAAATCAGGAGGGC(A)G
(A)GGGTAAAG-30 (sense), 50 -CCCTCCTGATTTCCATAAAAATCA-30 (antisense). Underlined sequences represent putative
Sp1-binding sites, and the mutated nucleotides are marked by
brackets.
Luciferase reporter assays
SK-N-BE cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of
50,000 cells/well, and transiently transfected with reporter
constructs driven by the MYCN promoter (200 ng) and pRLTK Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (20 ng). After the
indicated time periods, cells were collected and washed with
PBS, and their luciferase activities were measured using a
luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Each experiment
was performed at least 3 times in triplicate.
siRNA transfection
A mixture of 2 siRNAs with antisense sequences of 50 UCUUGGUUGAGCUGUGUAGTT-30 and 50 -UUGUGGACACUCACUAUUCTT-30 were designed to target human NLRR1
(TAKARA). Control siRNA was purchased from Ambion (Cat
4635). SK-N-BE cells were transfected with 20 nmol/L of the
indicated siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen).

Animals and tumor xenograft studies
Male BALB/c athymic (nu/nu) mice (5–6 weeks old) were
purchased from Japan SLC, and maintained under speciﬁc
pathogen-free conditions strictly following the Chiba Cancer
Center Research Institute guidelines. Stably expressing
NLRR1 and mock SH-SY5Y cell lines were established by
transfection followed by selection with G418 at a concentration of 600 mg/mL for about 6 to 8 weeks. Single colonies
were picked to conﬁrm the ectopic expression of NLRR1.
Three NLRR1-expressing clones were used for the tumor
xenograft studies, and 3 mock-transfected single clones were
used as negative controls. A total of 6 groups of mice (7 mice
in each group) received subcutaneous injections of 1  107
cells dissolved in 100 mL PBS. The length and width of each
tumor was recorded each week at the indicated time periods. Tumor volume was calculated according the following
formula: [length  (width)2]/2 (25, 26). Survival curves were
generated using the Kaplan–Meier method using SPSS software. Log-rank tests were performed to calculate the P value

NLRR1 enhances EGF/IGF-mediated cell proliferation in
neuroblastoma cells
Our previous report showed that NLRR1 is a direct transcriptional target of MYCN in neuroblastoma, and is associated with cell proliferation and survival (14). However, the
mechanism by which NLRR1 regulates cell proliferation was
still unknown. Another member of leucine rich repeat protein family, NLRR3, has been associated with the activation
of ERK (15), and EGFR activation was reported to accelerate
neuroblastoma cell proliferation (16), suggesting the possi-

bility that NLRR1 may activate EGFR to induce cell proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst investigated neuroblastoma cell proliferation upon EGF and IGF-I treatment.
Consistent with their proliferative role (16, 17), both EGF
and IGF-I also accelerated the proliferation of SK-N-BE cells
(Fig. 1A). Similar data were also observed in neuroblastoma
SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). To determine whether
NLRR1 promotes EGF- and IGF-1–mediated cell proliferation, we transiently transfected SK-N-BE cells with NLRR1
expression plasmid and treated them with EGF and IGF-I.
Interestingly, ectopic expression of NLRR1 enhanced the cell
proliferation mediated by EGF and IGF-I (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of NLRR1 in SH-SY5Y showed similar promotion

down endogenous NLRR1. The data suggested that knockdown of NLRR1 suppressed the EGF- and IGF-1–mediated

EGF 0

EGF stimulation induces MYCN via ERK
IGF-I stimulation induces endogenous MYCN expression in
neuroblastoma cells via MAPK activation (17). Therefore, it is
possible that EGF can induce MYCN, because EGF treatment
also activates MAPK. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated
SK-N-BE cells cultured in serum-free medium with increasing
amounts of EGF. Consistent with our hypothesis, both mRNA
and protein levels of MYCN were induced upon EGF treatment
(Fig. 3A). Time course experiments were also used to conﬁrm
that EGF can induce MYCN. MYCN was found to be induced at 6
hours after EGF treatment (Fig. 3B). Under our experimental
conditions, EGF treatment successfully phosphorylated EGFR
(Supplementary Fig. S1) and ERK (data not shown). We also
observed that EGF stimulation induced MYCN expression in
other neuroblastoma cell lines, SH-SY5Y and NLF (data not
shown). To verify our experimental data that EGF induces
MYCN, we used VEGF as positive control, which was reported
to be induced by EGF (28). AG1478 is a speciﬁc inhibitor for
EGFR, and is sufﬁcient to block EGFR-mediated activation of
ERK (29, 30). We have conﬁrmed the effect of the optimum
concentration of AG1478 to inhibit EGF-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR in the cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore,
we used the optimum concentrations of AG1478 to elucidate
that EGF-mediated MYCN induction is dependent on EGFRERK signaling. Consistently, MYCN induction by EGF was
successfully blocked in AG1478-pretreated SK-N-BE cells (Fig.

NLRR1 enhances EGF and IGF-mediated activation of
ERK
Because ERK is an important kinase that is often regulated
by EGF and IGF-1 growth factors to induce cell proliferation,
we were interested to determine whether NLRR1 affected ERK
phosphorylation upon EGF and IGF-I treatment. We examined
the activation of ERK in NLRR1-overexpressing cells. Interestingly, ERK phosphorylation was enhanced compared with the
mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). The increased phosphorylation of EGFR was observed in the NLRR1 overexpressing SK-NBE cells upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 2A). Similar data were also
observed in SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). We also used
siRNA studies to further elucidate the role of NLRR1 in EGF and
IGF-1 signaling. Consistent with the overexpression study, we
observed a reduction in ERK phosphorylation in NLRR1 knockdown cells upon both EGF and IGF-1 treatment compared with
the control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). Interestingly,
phosphorylation of EGFR and IGFR was found to be decreased
in NLRR1 knockdown cells (Fig. 2B). To elucidate whether the
activation of ERK is important for cell proliferation, we used
the MEK1/2-speciﬁc inhibitor, U0126 (27), in the cell proliferation assays. For the cell proliferation assays, we have used the
minimum concentration of U0126 (5 mmol/L) required to
inhibit ERK activation in the cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The data showed that EGF- and IGF-I–mediated proliferation
of NLRR1-overexpressing SK-N-BE cells was inhibited upon
U0126 treatment (Fig. 2C).

induction is dependent on ERK (Fig. 3C, right panel). These
data collectively suggest that EGF-mediated MYCN induction
is dependent on the EGFR–ERK pathway in neuroblastoma
cells.
EGF enhances MYCN transcription via recruitment of
Sp1 to the MYCN promoter
To conﬁrm the EGF-mediated MYCN transcription, we
generated a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a MYCN
genomic fragment spanning positions 221 to þ21 (Fig. 4A,
left panel), where þ1 represents the transcriptional initiation
site. This promoter region contains both Sp1 and E2F1 transcriptional element sites (31, 32). We also used the empty
control vector pGL3basic to compare the EGF responses. SKN-BE cells were transiently transfected with pGL3basic and
pGL3-MYCN (221, þ21) together with Renilla luciferase
reporter plasmid. The data showed that EGF stimulation
signiﬁcantly enhanced the promoter activity of MYCN gene
at 6 hours (Fig. 4A, right panel): pGL3-Basic reporter constructs
did not respond to EGF treatment (Fig. 4A, right), suggesting
that EGF treatment is speciﬁc to the MYCN promoter. MYCN
has been reported to be transcriptionally regulated by 2 major
transcription factors, Sp1 and E2F1 (31, 32). To determine the
regulatory mechanism of EGF-mediated MYCN transcription,
we performed ChIP assays. Both antibodies against Sp1 and
E2F1 used for ChIP assays pulled down the speciﬁc

Figure 4. EGF enhances Sp1-mediated transactivation of MYCN. A, MYCN core promoter region (221 to þ21) cloned in pGL3Basic luciferase vector (left) was
transiently transfected into SK-N-BE cells for 36 hours, followed by culture in serum-free medium for 12 hours. Cells were then treated with EGF (50 ng/mL) for
the indicated time periods, and luciferase assays were carried out to quantify the relative promoter activity. B, SK-N-BE cells were cultured in
serum-free medium for 12 hours, followed by treatment for 12 hours with EGF (50 ng/mL). Cross-linked chromatin was isolated from the cells and precipitated
with Sp1- and E2F1-speciﬁc antibodies or with normal rabbit serum (NRS). C, Sp1 site 1-deleted MYCN core promoter failed to respond to EGF stimulation.
Two Sp1-binding sites on the MYCN core promoter region were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis (left). Relative activity of the deleted promoter
constructs were measured by luciferase assays in SK-N-BE cells 24 hours after transfection (middle). SK-N-BE cells were transiently transfected by the 2 Sp1
site deleted constructs, followed by culture in serum-free medium for 12 hours and then treatment with EGF (50 ng/mL). Twelve hours after EGF treatment,
ﬁreﬂy luciferase activities were determined (right). Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control to standardize the transfection efﬁciency of the luciferase
vectors.

endogenous proteins (data not shown). Twelve hours after EGF
stimulation, chromatin DNA from SK-N-BE cells was crosslinked and processed for ChIP assays. Sp1-derived pulled-down
chromatin was ampliﬁed by a speciﬁc primer targeting the
MYCN core promoter region (221 to þ21) in the EGF-treated
cells (Fig. 4B top panel), suggesting that EGF enhances recruitment of Sp1 to the MYCN promoter. However, no change in
E2F1 recruitment was observed between the EGF-treated and
untreated cells (Fig. 4B, bottom panel).
To identify the critical Sp1-binding region required for the
transactivation of MYCN, we mutated the Sp1-binding elements (Fig. 4C, left panel) by PCR reactions, as described in the
Materials and Methods section. SK-N-BE cells were transiently
transfected with wild-type MYCN promoter as well as the
mutated luciferase constructs. Promoter assays showed that
the pGL3MYCN (mut-1) construct had signiﬁcantly (P < 0.001)
less promoter activity (Fig. 4C, middle panel) than the wild type
and pGL3MYCN (mut-2) constructs. Furthermore, we transiently transfected the wild type, as well as the Sp1 site 1deleted constructs, into the SK-N-BE cells to determine the
effects on EGF. The data showed that the deletion construct
failed to respond to EGF treatment (Fig. 4C, right panel),

suggesting that the Sp1-binding element 1 is important for
EGF-mediated transactivation of MYCN.
To check whether Sp1 is critical for the expression of
MYCN, we knocked down Sp1 using siRNAs. Consistently,
MYCN expression was suppressed in cells transfected with
siRNAs against Sp1 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Both siRNAs
against Sp1 reduced MYCN promoter activity (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Cell proliferation was also suppressed in the Sp1
knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C). It has been
reported that EGF stimulation induces phosphorylation of
ERK, and that this phosphorylation event may be important
for Sp1 phosphorylation (33) and recruitment to the target
gene promoter. Similarly, our results also showed that EGF
treatment resulted in phosphorylation of Sp1, and this phosphorylation event was inhibited in U0126- and calf intestinal
phosphatase (CIAP)-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
CIAP treatment is reported to block recruitment of phosphotranscriptional factors on genomic DNA (35). We also used
Mithramycin-A (Mit-A), a well-known Sp1 inhibitor (34). EGFmediated MYCN induction was successfully inhibited in cells
pretreated with Mit-A (Supplementary Fig. S3B) and CIAP
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). Consistently, CIAP treatment also

NLRR1 Modulates EGF-Mediated MYCN Induction

Stable expression of NLRR1 in cells accelerates tumor
growth in nude mice
NLRR1 is highly expressed in aggressive MYCN-ampliﬁed
neuroblastoma (14), suggesting the possibility that NLRR1
may have a potent tumorigenic role. NLRR1 overexpression
enhanced the colony formation ability of SH-SY5Y cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). Consistent with our previous
observation that ectopic expression of NLRR1 enhanced cell
proliferation and inhibited apoptosis, NLRR1-stably expressing SH-SY5Y clones proliferated faster than mock stable
clones (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Furthermore, MYCN
expression was upregulated in NLRR1 stable clones compared with mock clones (Supplementary Fig. S4B), suggesting that NLRR1 has oncogenic potential. To elucidate the
tumorigenic activity of NLRR1, we performed tumor xenograft studies in nude mice using NLRR1-stably expressing
SH-SY5Y clones. Signiﬁcant enhancement of tumor growth
was observed in mice bearing NLRR1-expressing xenografts
compared with the mock-expressing xenografts (P < 0.01; Fig.
6A). Mice of each group were sacriﬁced when they become
morbid, and the survival curve was analyzed using the
Kaplan–Meier method. The survival of mice with NLRR1expressing xenografts was signiﬁcantly shorter compared
with mice-bearing mock xenografts (P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 6B).
Immunohistochemical data showed that NLRR1-expressing
tumors had increased numbers of Ki-67–positive cells and
decreased number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive
cells compared with mock tumors (Fig. 6C), indicating that
there were more proliferative cells in the tumors derived
from NLRR1-expressing clones. To see the consistence in

NLRR1 enhances MYCN induction
ERK is reported to induce phosphorylation of Sp1 (33). In
our present ﬁndings, NLRR1 promotes phosphorylation of
ERK upon EGF treatment, suggesting that NLRR1 may
induce MYCN. Therefore, we overexpressed NLRR1 in SKN-BE cells and found that endogenous MYCN was effectively
induced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A, left panel).
NLRR1-mediated MYCN induction was inhibited in U0126and AG1478-pretreated cells (Fig. 5A, right panel), suggesting that NLRR1 induced MYCN via EGFR-ERK signaling.
Ectopic expression of NLRR1 in cells accelerated MYCN
induction upon EGF treatment compared with that of
mock-transfected (empty pcDNA3.1 vector) cells (Fig. 5B,
left panel). Consistent with the overexpression study, knockdown of NLRR1 suppressed MYCN induction, suggesting that
NLRR1 accelerates EGF-mediated MYCN induction. To
determine whether NLRR1 enhances Sp1 recruitment, we
performed ChIP assays. The data show that overexpression
of NLRR1 in SK-N-BE cells increased Sp1 recruitment to the
MYCN promoter, which was further accelerated upon EGF
treatment (Fig. 5C).

immunoblotting was carried out to detect NLRR1, p-ERK, total ERK, and
MYCN expression (left). EGFR and ERK inhibitors prevent MYCN

transiently transfected with NLRR1 expression plasmids for 48 hours and
then treated with or without AG1478 (20 mmol/L) and U0126 (10 mmol/L).

MYCN expression (left). Forty hours after transfection with control siRNA
and NLRR1-siRNA, SK-N-BE cells were serum starved for 12 hours and

Discussion
Upregulated MKK-ERK signaling is known to be involved in
the genesis of several cancers (18–21). Multidrug-resistant
human neuroblastoma cells have three- to 30-fold more cell
surface EGFRs than the drug-sensitive parental cells (36),
indicating that EGFRs may play an important role in the
aggressiveness of human neuroblastoma. EGF stimuli activated MAPK in neuroblastoma (16) and IGF-1 enhanced neuroblastoma cell proliferation via activation of MAPK (17). NLRR
family proteins are considered to modulate cellular signaling,
especially that of MAPKs (15). Although it was reported that
overexpression of NLRR1 enhances cell proliferation and inhibits cellular apoptosis in neuroblastoma, our previous study
did not rule out the involvement of NLRR1 with EGF and IGF-1
signaling. Here, we ﬁrst report that ectopic expression of
NLRR1 also enhanced EGF- and IGF-1–mediated cellular proliferation, which is inhibited in cells treated with MEK1/2
inhibitor. This suggests that NLRR1-mediated promotion of
proliferation is at least in part dependent on activation of ERK.
However, the method by which NLRR1 enhances EGFR and
IGFR signaling still needs to be clariﬁed. Another NLRR family
protein, NLRR3, was reported to induce phosphorylation of
ERK in response to EGF (15), suggesting the possibility that

NLRR1 that is 54% homology to NLRR3 may also induce ERK
phosphorylation. Our results propose that NLRR1 is important
in enhancing ERK phosphorylation in cells upon EGF and IGF
stimuli. Interestingly, NLRR1 affects p-ERK and p-AKT in
different extent (Fig. 2B) that depends on cell lines (data not
shown). The reason behind this selectivity is unknown and
need to be addressed further in the future.
ERK is known to phosphorylate many transcriptional factors, including Sp1 (33, 37). Moreover, Sp1 and E2F1 are reported to transcriptionally regulate MYCN in neuroblastoma
(31, 32). Therefore, there may be an important link between
the activation of ERK and MYCN induction, which is further
supported by the evidence that IGF-1 can induce MYCN via
activation of MAPK (17). However, in this report of EGF-1mediated MYCN induction, the involvement of Sp1 or E2F1 was
not explained. Here, we report that EGF induces MYCN via the
EGFR-ERK pathway. Several stimuli, including retinoic acid
and TGF-b repress the MYCN gene, and are associated with
recruited Sp1 and E2F1 and their other cofactors (31, 38). By
using ChIP assays, we observed that Sp1 but not E2F1 was
recruited to the MYCN promoter in response to EGF. However,
it has been reported that the presence of Sp1 is not always
sufﬁcient to activate a transcriptionally silent MYCN gene (32).

NLRR1 Modulates EGF-Mediated MYCN Induction

Therefore, we have further investigated whether Sp1 is important for MYCN induction in our experimental conditions.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sp1-reduced MYCN expression
and also inhibited cell proliferation, suggesting that Sp1mediated MYCN induction regulates cell proliferation. Using
luciferase reporter assays, we identiﬁed the responsive Sp1binding element in the promoter region for MYCN induction.
Sp1 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for the interaction with
genomic DNA (33). Therefore, we also investigated whether
EGF induces Sp1 phosphorylation and enhances its recruitment to the MYCN promoter. Western blotting data showed
that EGF treatment enhanced phosphorylation of Sp1, and
the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 inhibited this phosphorylation
event, supporting the previous report that ERK induces Sp1
phosphorylation (33). Using the dephosphorylating agent
CIAP, we further conﬁrmed that phospho-Sp1 is involved in
the transactivation of MYCN by recruitment to the genomic
DNA of the MYCN promoter. Collectively, this evidence suggests that EGF induces MYCN through phospho-Sp1 recruitment to the MYCN promoter. However, MYCN induction by
IGF-1 was not investigated in the present study, but we
speculate that it may be by the same mechanism as EGF,
because IGF-1 has been reported to activate MAPK in
neuroblastoma.
Another new ﬁnding of our current study is that MYCN is
induced after ectopic expression of NLRR1 in neuroblastoma
cells. Under our experimental conditions, EGF-mediated
MYCN induction was accelerated in NLRR1-overexpressing
cells and inhibited in NLRR1-knockdown cells, suggesting that
NLRR1 enhances MYCN induction and activation of ERK. In
addition, NLRR1 overexpression enhanced Sp1 recruitment to
the MYCN promoter. We previously reported that NLRR1
transcriptionally regulated by MYCN is highly expressed in
aggressive neuroblastoma (14). NLRR1 was also found to be
highly expressed in MYCN-ampliﬁed tumors compared with
that of MYCN nonampliﬁed neuroblastoma. Therefore, we
suggest that MYCN directly regulates NLRR1, and that NLRR1
further induces MYCN through the activation of the EGFR-ERK
cascade, suggesting a positive feedback loop between NLRR1
and MYCN that may lead to aggressive neuroblastoma. To
this notion, we further determined the in vivo tumorigenic
activity of NLRR1 in MYCN nonampliﬁed SH-SY5Y cells, which

are well known to form tumors in nude mice (39, 40). Our
results show that SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing NLRR1
rapidly proliferate in culture medium and in nude mice, and
promote decreased survival rates among inoculated mice,
presumably by induced endogenous MYCN.
In conclusion, our results provide signiﬁcant evidence that
that NLRR1 enhances ERK signaling to induce MYCN, which
may play major roles in the progression of aggressive neuroblastoma. Taking note that MYCN highly expressing tumors
are often resistant to antitumor therapies, new drug discovery
blocking NLRR1-mediated ERK signaling to control MYCN
expression may be an attractive choice in treating aggressive
neuroblastoma.
