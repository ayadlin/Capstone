Abstract
Bevacizumab [Avastin; anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody] is an antiangiogenic IgG
approved for treating patients with certain types of colon, breast, and lung cancer. In these indications,
bevacizumab is administered every 2 to 3 weeks, prompting us to study ways to reduce the frequency of
administration. Increasing affinity to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) may extend the pharmacokinetic half-life
of an antibody, but the quantitative effect of FcRn affinity on clearance has not been clearly elucidated. To gain
further insight into this relationship, we engineered a series of anti-VEGF antibody variants with minimal
amino acid substitutions and showed a range of half-life improvements in primates. These results suggest
that, if proven clinically safe and effective, a modified version of bevacizumab could potentially provide clinical
benefit to patients on long-term anti-VEGF therapy through less-frequent dosing and improved compliance
with drug therapy. Moreover, despite having half-life similar to that of wild-type in mice due to the speciesspecific FcRn binding effects, the variant T307Q/N434A exhibited superior in vivo potency in slowing the
growth of certain human tumor lines in mouse xenograft models. These results further suggest that FcRn
variants may achieve increased potency through unidentified mechanisms in addition to increased systemic
exposure. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3269–77. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The development and use of therapeutic antibodies to
treat cancer has increased dramatically in recent years, including, for example, bevacizumab [Avastin; anti–vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody] as an antiangiogenic agent in the treatment of several types of malignancies (1). In addition to offering highly specific, high-affinity
binding interactions with their antigens, IgGs have an advantage over other biologics and small molecules in that
they persist in the circulation with long systemic half-lives,
mediated by the pH-dependent interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn; refs. 2–7). Multiple genetic knockout
and knock-in experiments in mice have confirmed that
FcRn is important for the homeostasis and transcytosis of
IgGs (8–13).

Therapeutic antibodies with extended half-life offer the
potential benefit of lower frequency of administration. Modulating the interaction between Fc and FcRn through protein engineering may improve the pharmacokinetics of
antibodies (14–22) through increased pH 6 affinity. However, increased pH 7.4 affinity may hinder the release of IgG
variants and offset any pharmacokinetic improvement (14,
22). Hitherto, the detailed relationship between FcRn affinity and half-life has not been elucidated, as previous studies have focused on a small number of variants, within a
limited range of FcRn affinities. Therefore, the maximal
IgG1 half-life extension achievable through engineering
the Fc-FcRn interaction has been unclear. Previously, in
primate studies of a different antibody (targeting a cell surface receptor), we found that a human IgG1 Fc variant
(N434A) with 3-fold increased FcRn binding at pH 6.0
had modestly improved pharmacokinetics over wild-type
(WT); however, another Fc variant (N434W), which had
∼40-fold affinity improvement, did not exhibit improved
pharmacokinetics (22). We were therefore motivated to
study additional antibody variants with intermediate binding affinities for primate FcRn.
Here, we constructed five Fc variants with varying FcRn
affinities on bevacizumab (1, 23), a humanized anti-VEGF–
A (or VEGF) IgG1 antibody, to perform a comprehensive
pharmacokinetic study in cynomolgus monkeys using large
cohorts (n = 12 animals per group) to detect modest pharmacokinetic changes, as well as comparative efficacy studies in
mice expressing a humanized form of VEGF-A. Our results

identify the optimal range of FcRn affinity for an Fc variant
to achieve maximal half-life extension in primates, with the
serum half-life of our most-improved Fc variant, T307Q/
N434A, measuring ∼25 days under the conditions of this
study in cynomolgus monkeys.
We also compared the in vivo tumor inhibition activities of
the WT bevacizumab antibody and the T307Q/N434A variant
in mouse xenograft studies. Paradoxically, despite having no
systemic half-life improvement in mice due to the speciesspecific nature of FcRn binding, the T307Q/N434A variant exhibited superior potency in treating selected human tumor
xenografts in mice. Our work suggests more generally that
an antibody Fc variant engineered for improved FcRn affinity
may achieve improved potency via new mechanism(s) in
addition to increased persistence in serum.

Materials and Methods
Expression of anti-VEGF antibodies and FcRn. Selected
Fc mutations were incorporated into anti-VEGF IgG1 using
Kunkel-based mutagenesis as previously described (24).
Briefly, heavy and light chain cDNAs encoding each antibody
were transiently transfected into Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells, and the antibodies were purified over protein
A columns followed by size exclusion chromatography. Extracellular domains of human, cynomolgus monkey, and murine FcRn were expressed in 293 or CHO cells as previously
described (22).
FcRn binding studies using surface plasmon resonance.
The binding affinities of the antibodies to human and cynomolgus monkey FcRn were determined using a BIAcore 3000
instrument (GE Healthcare) as previously described (22).
Briefly, the antibodies were conjugated directly onto the
CM5 sensor chips using an amine coupling kit, and FcRn
was injected over the antibody-conjugated flow cell. The kinetic parameters and dissociation constants (KD) were then
determined using the BIAevaluation software.
Pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys. Naive cynomolgus monkeys, weighing 2 to 5 kg and 2 to 7 y in age, were
assigned to six treatment groups, each consisting of six males
and six females. All animals received on day 1 a single i.v.
bolus dose of 5 mg/kg via the saphenous vein followed by
a 0.9% saline flush. Blood samples (∼1.0 mL) from the femoral vein were collected before and after dose at 0.5, 2, 4, and
8 h and at 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 70 d. The
study was conducted at Covance under standard operating
procedures and in compliance with applicable regulations
about the use of laboratory animals.
Serum antibody concentrations were detected using a
VEGF capture ELISA (25, 26). Briefly, Maxisorp ELISA plates
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with 0.5 μg/mL of recombinant human VEGF. Two-fold serially diluted standards
(0.20–25 ng/mL) as well as 3-fold serially diluted cynomolgus
monkey serum samples (minimum 1:10 dilution) were added
to the blocked plates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. Bound drug was detected by incubation
with sheep anti-human IgG–horseradish peroxidase (HRP;
diluted 1:2,000; The Binding Site) for 1 h at room tempera-

ture. The plates were then developed with tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Moss). The plates were read on a microplate
reader at a wavelength of 450 to 620 nm.
Pharmacokinetic parameters for cynomolgus monkeys were
estimated using WinNonlin Enterprise version 5.1.1 (Pharsight
Corp.). A two-compartment model with i.v. bolus input, firstorder elimination, and microrate constants (Model 7) was used
to describe the observed data for individual cynomolgus monkey concentration-time profiles. Concentrations were weighted using iterative reweighting (1/y) and the Gauss-Newton
minimization algorithm with Levenberg and Hartley modification. Differences in mean t1/2,β were analyzed using the TukeyKramer honestly significant difference correction for multiple
comparisons, executed via the multcomp v 1.0-2 package in R
version 2.7.2 (R Development Core Team, 2008).
Pharmacokinetics in VEGF knock-in mice. Rag2 KO;
hum-X VEGF KI mice (27) were assigned to four groups with
eight to nine animals per group; a 0.3 mg/kg and a 5 mg/kg
dose group were designated for the bevacizumab WT and
T307Q/N434A variant. Each animal received a single i.v. dose
of either 0.3 or 5 mg/kg of antibody via the tail vein. Blood
samples from three mice were collected at 15 min; at 8 and
24 h; and at 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 d after dose. Serum
antibody concentrations were detected similarly as described
for cynomolgus monkey serum samples using a VEGF
capture ELISA, except goat anti-human Fc HRP (Jackson)
was used for detection. Group mean serum antibody concentration-time profiles were used to estimate pharmacokinetic
parameters in mice using WinNonlin Enterprise, version
5.1.1. To estimate pharmacokinetic parameters, a twocompartment elimination model with i.v. bolus input and
first-order elimination, and with microrate constants, was
used to describe the observed data (WinNonlin Model 7).
Concentrations were weighted using iterative reweighting
(1/y) and the Nelder-Mead minimization algorithm. A naive
pooled approach was used with all observed data to provide
one estimate for each treatment group. All procedures used
in the mouse pharmacokinetic and mouse efficacy studies
followed protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
In vivo efficacy studies. Growth conditions of HM-7 (colorectal carcinoma) and Calu-6 (lung carcinoma) cells were
previously described (28). Human HT-55 (colorectal carcinoma) was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1 μg/mL fungizone (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37°C in 5% CO2 until
confluent, harvested, and resuspended in sterile Matrigel at
50 × 106/mL. Xenografts were established in 6- to 8-wk-old
Rag2 KO; hum-X VEGF KI double-homozygous mice (Genentech; ref. 27) by dorsal flank s.c. injection of 5 × 106 cells per
mouse and allowed to grow. Antibodies were administered
i.p. at the dose of 5, 0.5, and 0.05 mg/kg twice weekly 24 h after tumor cell inoculation. The transplanted tumors were
measured twice weekly as described (28). Tumor volume
for each mouse was calculated after each measurement,
and the mean tumor volumes from different treatment
groups were compared by Student's t test, with significance

Anti-VEGF Antibodies with Extended Half-life

The binding affinities of the anti-VEGF antibodies to
primate FcRn were first determined using surface plasmon
resonance. The KD of the WT IgG for cynomolgus monkey
and human FcRn (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1,
respectively) agreed well with previous values for other human
IgG1s (14, 16). The IgG variants exhibited about 5- to 35-fold
and 4- to 26-fold increases in pH 6.0 affinity over WT to cynomolgus monkey FcRn and to human FcRn, respectively. Three
variants previously studied in the context of trastuzumab
(Herceptin; anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody)—namely,
N434H, T307Q/N434A, and V308P/N434A—also corresponded
well with previous measurements versus trastuzumab (22).
The pH 7.4 affinity ranking of all these antibodies was the
same as that at pH 6.0 (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating
similar pH dependency of FcRn binding and release. Overall,
the affinity increase for each variant was comparable for
cynomolgus monkey and human FcRn.
Table 1 shows that the increase in FcRn affinity among the
variants was largely due to a decrease in koff, and the pH dependence of koff was similar for each variant (Supplementary
Fig. S2). All of the variants were confirmed to have the same
VEGF binding affinity. They also inhibited VEGF-induced
in vitro human umbilical vascular endothelial cell proliferation as effectively as bevacizumab (Supplementary Fig. S3),
consistent with the fact that they contain identical variable
domains for binding VEGF.
Pharmacokinetics of anti-VEGF Fc variant antibodies in
cynomolgus monkeys. The pharmacokinetics of anti-VEGF
WT and five variants were examined in cynomolgus monkeys
(n = 12 animals per group) following a single i.v. dose of
5 mg/kg. The average serum concentration-time profiles
and tabulated half-lives are shown in Fig. 1A and Table 1, respectively. The WT bevacizumab studied here had a terminal
half-life (t1/2,β) of 11.4 ± 1.5 days and a clearance rate (CL) of
4.01 ± 0.67 mL/d/kg (Supplementary Table S2), both of which
are comparable with the previously obtained data for Avastin
in cynomolgus monkeys (29). All of the variants exhibit

identified at a level of P < 0.05. Blood samples were also collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Mice were sacrificed
when tumor volume reached 2,000 mm3. At the end of treatment, tumors were excised, weighed, and then homogenized.
The total protein contents in tumor homogenates were determined using Bradford Coomassie assay (Pierce) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibody concentrations in
the serum and tumor homogenates were measured in an
ELISA using rabbit anti-Fc capture (Jackson) and goat
anti-human Fc-HRP (Jackson) for detection.
FcRn immunoprecipitation using a high-affinity IgG1
variant. Five million cells per each of either HM-7, HT-55,
Calu-6, or Raji (B-cell lymphoma) lines were lysed by incubating
in 25 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1%
NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mmol/L EDTA,
150 mmol/L NaCl, and 1× protease inhibitor (Pierce) for
1 h at 4°C. Lysed cells were centrifuged and then 50 nmol/L
trastuzumab Fc variant M252Y/V308P/N434A (22) was added
to the supernatant to capture the FcRn at 4°C. Protein-L
(Pierce) resin was then added and washed. Bound proteins were
eluted with a 2× loading buffer (Invitrogen) and detected in
Western blot using 1 ng/mL of rabbit anti- human FcRn
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat anti-rabbit
IgG-peroxidase conjugate at 1:104 dilution (Pierce).

Results
Design, construction, and in vitro characterization of
anti-VEGF Fc variants. To probe how FcRn affinity affects
half-life, five anti-VEGF antibody variants with KD (equilibrium dissociation constant; see Materials and Methods) improvements of 5- to 35-fold for primate FcRn binding were
designed using combinations of mutations at four Fc sites:
N434H, T307Q/N434A, T307Q/N434S, T307Q/E380A/N434S,
and V308P/N434A [Fc positions are indicated by EU numbering; WT residues (preceding the position) and mutations
(following) are shown in single-letter code].

N434A) do not offer further improvement in half-life; instead,
there is an insignificant trend toward reduced half-life at higher
affinities. Our results therefore suggest that ∼10-fold increased
relative affinity for primate FcRn, as measured here for T307Q/
N434A, may offer maximal half-life improvement in primates.
Pharmacokinetics of anti-VEGF WT and T307Q/N434A
in mice. Because murine and primate FcRn have different
affinities for human IgG1 as well as for Fc variants, a
pharmacokinetic study in nontumor-bearing, genetically
engineered mice (expressing a humanized form of VEGF-A;
see below) was performed as a prelude to mouse efficacy
studies. As shown in Fig. 2, despite having higher murine
FcRn affinity at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.4 (Supplementary
Table S3; Supplementary Fig. S4), the selected variant
T307Q/N434A exhibits similar clearance and half-life as WT
in mice (Supplementary Table S4) using two different dosage
groups. These results imply that any potential difference in
pharmacodynamics between WT and T307Q/N434A does
not result from systemic clearance differences.
In vivo potency of anti-VEGF WT and T307Q/N434A
in mice. Having established similar pharmacokinetics for
these two antibodies in mice, we compared their in vivo potency and efficacy in treating human tumor xenografts grown
in immunocompromised knock-in mice expressing a humanized form of VEGF-A (Rag2 KO; hum-X VEGF KI mice; ref.
27). Such mice are useful for making comparisons with bevacizumab because this antibody does not recognize murine
VEGF, which is often a stromal component of tumor growth.
WT and T307Q/N434A antibodies were tested in inhibiting
the growth of HM-7 (colorectal carcinoma), HT-55 (colorectal carcinoma), and Calu-6 (lung carcinoma) human tumor
xenografts in Rag2 KO; hum-X VEGF KI mice. Figure 3A
shows that, at a dose of 5 mg/kg, T307Q/N434A is equally
efficacious as WT in inhibiting the growth of HM-7 tumors.

t1/2,β, and reduced CL compared with WT (P < 0.001), with

The relationship between terminal half-life in cynomolgus
monkey and pH 6.0 KD is depicted in Fig. 1B. These results
agree with previous observations that modest increases in
pH 6.0 affinity yield prolonged t1/2,β (15, 16, 18), as evidenced
by N434H and T307Q/N434A. Intriguingly, Fig. 1B shows that
additional increases in pH 6.0 affinity beyond 10-fold (i.e., in
the case of T307Q/N434S, T307Q/E380A/N434A, and V308P/

Anti-VEGF Antibodies with Extended Half-life

Figure 3. Efficacy of anti–VEGF-A WT and T307Q/N434A variant antibodies in treating human colorectal tumor xenografts implanted in Rag2 KO; hum-X
VEGF KI mice. Doses of 5, 0.5, and 0.05 mg/kg of WT or T307Q/N434A (QA), or 5 mg/kg of anti-ragweed control, were administered i.p. twice weekly.
Colorectal tumor lines were HM-7 (A and B) or HT-55 (C and D). *, P < 0.05, statistically significant differences between WT and variant by dose. A, growth

T307Q/N434A treatments are significantly different (P < 0.001) from the anti-ragweed treatment in both xenograft models.

Surprisingly, similar inhibition of HM-7 tumor growth was
observed at the 0.5 mg/kg dose of T307Q/N434A as at the
5 mg/kg dose of WT. This increase in potency (i.e., equal
effect at lower dose) was not due to differences in serum
antibody concentrations between WT and T307Q/N434A, as
concentrations of both antibodies in multiple serum samples
taken during the treatment were comparable (data not
shown), consistent with the mouse pharmacokinetic data
described above. However, we did observe statistically

significant increases in the antibody concentrations within
the tumors for the 0.5 and 0.05 mg/kg T307Q/N434A-treated
groups compared with the corresponding WT groups
(Fig. 3B). The HM-7 xenograft study was repeated two more
times, and increased potency for the variant over WT was
similarly observed in both additional studies (Supplementary
Figs. S5 and S6).
Both antibodies also achieved complete inhibition of the
HT-55 and Calu-6 tumor growth at 5 mg/kg. For the HT-55

xenografts (Fig. 3C and D), we noted a less significant trend
toward improved potency than with HM-7, whereas for the
Calu-6 xenografts (Fig. 4A and B), there was no observed difference in potency. This lack of significantly improved potency for HT-55 and Calu-6 relative to HM-7 was perhaps due to
an absence of preferential accumulation of the variant within
the tumor (Fig. 3D). We subsequently found that all three cell
lines examined in this study showed considerably high level
of FcRn expression (Fig. 4C; also supported by our in-house
microarray data; data not shown). However, the increased
concentration of variant detected in the HM-7 tumors relative to the HT-55 and Calu-6 tumors is not directly correlated
with cellular FcRn expression level, as HM-7 cells express
lower amounts of FcRn than either HT-55 or Calu-6 cells
(Fig. 4C); indeed, Western blots showed that the FcRn
expression levels in HT-55 and Calu-6 are about 50% and
10% higher than that in HM-7, respectively.

Discussion
In this work, we engineered five anti-VEGF antibody variants with KD improvements for primate FcRn ranging from
5- to 35-fold compared with bevacizumab. By determining
the half-lives of these variants in vivo, we established a quantitative picture of how FcRn affinity affects IgG1 half-life in
cynomolgus monkeys (Fig. 1B). Our results show that a moderate increase in pH 6.0 affinity, up to 10-fold, yields extended
half-life, and suggest that further affinity increases will not
further increase half-life. Rapid clearance has been observed
in mouse pharmacokinetic studies using some high-affinity
human IgG1 variants (14, 19) and also recently shown in a
cynomolgus monkey pharmacokinetic study of a 40-fold increased affinity variant (22). The diminishing half-life returns
of increased FcRn affinity at pH 6.0 among these variants are
most likely due to their corresponding increases in neutral
pH binding (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2), preventing the
efficient release of FcRn-bound IgG back into circulation
and increasing the internalization of serum IgG into the cells
(5–7, 30, 31), and effectively offsetting the pharmacokinetic
advantage gained by binding increases at pH 6.0.
The half-life of T307Q/N434A, having ∼10-fold increased
FcRn affinity at pH 6.0 compared with bevacizumab, was
∼25 days in our primate study, corresponding to a 2.2-fold
half-life extension. In comparison, a previously reported
M252Y/S254T/T256E variant of humanized anti–respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV; ref. 16), which showed 9-fold increase
in pH 6.0 FcRn affinity, had slightly shorter half-life (21 days;
a reported 3.5-fold extension) than that of the T307Q/N434A
anti-VEGF antibody in our study. This apparent inconsistency may be due to the 2-fold shorter half-life of the WT antiRSV compared with WT anti-VEGF (bevacizumab), possibly
arising from a variety of factors (see below). Our results argue
that an Fc variant should have a pH 6.0 KD of ∼240 nmol/L as
measured in the binding assay described here to achieve
maximal half-life extension in primates.
Along with FcRn affinity, other factors, such as antibody
stability and specific clearance mechanisms (e.g., antigendependent clearance), can influence the pharmacokinetics

Anti-VEGF Antibodies with Extended Half-life

of human(ized) IgGs (20, 32, 33), and animal-to-animal
variability complicates pharmacokinetic comparisons (note:
n = 12 animals per group in our primate pharmacokinetic
study). However, we contend that the optimal FcRn affinity
should be generalizable to IgGs in which nonspecific mechanisms constitute the major mechanism of antibody
clearance. We predict that the affinity-versus-pharmacokinetics relationship in cynomolgus monkey will apply to humans, and several observations support this: human and
cynomolgus monkey FcRn share >95% sequence identity,
they bind human IgG1 with similar affinity and pH dependence, and they bind all of the anti-VEGF variants studied
here with similar affinity.
In contrast to our primate pharmacokinetic results, in our
mouse pharmacokinetic studies, due to species-specific binding of murine FcRn (34), the anti-VEGF variant T307Q/N434A
showed similar clearance as WT, and hence, we expected the
variant to have similar potency in mice xenograft studies. Indeed, similar potency was observed in the Calu-6 tumor
model (Fig. 4).
However, most surprisingly, in our further mouse efficacy
studies, T307Q/N434A exhibited superior potency in treating
selected tumor lines, namely, in three iterations of the HM-7
tumor model (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6)
as well as in the HT-55 tumor model (Fig. 3C and D) at
0.05mg/kg. This potency increase was not due to a difference
in FcγR binding affinity or complement activity between WT
and T307Q/N434A, nor any detectable nonspecific binding of
either antibody to HM-7 cells at either pH 6.0 or 7.4 (data not
shown). Instead, the potency increase correlated with increased concentration of antibody variant within certain tumors compared with WT antibody (Fig. 3B and D). This
potency increase was apparently not a result of elevated clearance in the WT groups, as antibody concentrations in serum
samples taken from both WT and variant-treated mice at various time points during the experiment were similar to those
estimated by using the pharmacokinetic parameters from
nontumor-bearing mice (data not shown). Terminal serum
concentrations were also similar in animals treated with
WT or variant (see Supplementary Figs. S5B and S6C).
We hypothesize that the increased potency of the variant
in certain mouse xenografts (e.g., HM-7) could be due to
increased retention and/or recycling of the variant antibody
mediated in part by the human FcRn expressed in these tumors. This may simply lead to an increased mass action effect of blocking locally produced VEGF or may provide a
mechanism for enhanced degradation of VEGF in the tumor.
Previously, another Fc variant with improved human FcRn
binding was shown to have slower degradation rate and
improved recycling behavior than WT in vitro, in human
tumor cells expressing FcRn (35). In a perhaps related
finding, Dall'Acqua and colleagues (16) reported that the concentration of the anti-RSV variant M252Y/S254T/T256E in the
bronchoalveolar lavage of cynomolgus monkeys increased
proportionally with the rise of serum IgG level. This tissuespecific accumulation could suggest an antibody-concentrating
effect arising from FcRn interactions. From these results, it is
reasonable to presume that the expression of human FcRn in

T307Q/N434A FcRn-binding antibody variant (open “Y”) in mouse
xenografts (A and B) and in humans (C). The Calu-6 xenograft model is
represented by A, where, at equal dosing, the two antibodies have
similar systemic exposure, similar tumor concentrations, and similar
potency. B, as suggested in Discussion, rapidly growing tumors such as
HM-7 may have specific features (e.g., lower local pH, favoring
pH-dependent binding to FcRn), increased tumor concentration of the
T307Q/N434A variant, and increased potency. C, a similar effect may be
predicted in certain human tumors, with the additional feature of
increased systemic exposure resulting from slower clearance as
observed in nonhuman primates.

the tumor cell lines (Fig. 4C) used in the mouse xenografts is
solely responsible for the observed increase in the retention of
variant antibody compared with WT. However, we found that
all cell lines tested did express relatively high levels of FcRn
(Fig. 4C). In addition, we did not find a direct correlation between the concentration effect and FcRn expression level, as
HM-7 cells had the lowest level of FcRn expression among
the three cell lines tested (Fig. 4C). Therefore, a simple,
FcRn-mediated, local retention model is not sufficient to account for the observed increase in antibody retention/potency.
It is likely that a variety of factors, such as tumor pH,
growth rate, FcRn expression pattern within the cells (basolateral versus apical), and other tumor constituents, play collaborative roles with FcRn in determining the distribution of
IgGs. For example, the tumor microenvironment is more acidic,
with pH ranging from 6.0 to 7.6 (median, 7.1) compared with
normal tissues with pH ranging from 7.3 to 7.8 (median, 7.55;
ref. 36). Furthermore, different types of tumors can have a
wide range of pH due to heterogeneous vascular supply and
blood perfusion (36, 37). Multiple in vitro studies indicate
that the amount of cell-associated Fc/IgG increases when
cells are incubated at acidic pH (38–40). Therefore, it is conceivable that pH differences among the tumor lines tested

may affect the accumulation level of antibody within each tumor. The extent of acidification in the tumor microenvironment may also be partly due to the tumor growth rate. The
fastest growing tumors (e.g., HM-7) may yield a lower pH tumor microenvironment, which in turn favors the retention of
FcRn variant antibodies. Additionally, the acidic tumor microenvironment also activates VEGF expression (36), which
could mediate the retention of these anti-VEGF antibodies
specifically.
In our model, the presence of both murine FcRn (in the
host) and human FcRn (in the tumor) complicates extrapolation to humans. We argue that the human-host/humantumor system favors an even greater distribution of FcRn
variant to the tumor because at equal doses we have shown
that the variant achieves higher systemic exposure in primates (as illustrated in Fig. 5). Because the potency effect
in mouse xenografts is specific to a particular tumor type
(colon cancer cell lines HM-7 and HT-55; but not lung cancer
line Calu-6), this potency effect is not only an artifact of the
human/mouse xenograft system. Instead, there must be tumor-specific factors, as discussed above, that result in tumor
localization of the variant antibody and increased potency. In
the human system, we expect to observe the increased
systemic exposure, and the “extra” potency effect may be
expected in cases where the tumor is similar to the HM-7
and HT-55 xenografts described here (Fig. 5).
An anti-VEGF FcRn-binding variant seems to offer the
potential for less-frequent dosing than the WT antibody in patients and may have additional activity benefits. Less-frequent
dosing, per se, has potential benefits of improved convenience
for patients, as well as perhaps improved compliance with
long-term dosing, which may ultimately improve the clinical

outcome of treatment. However, the pharmacokinetics,
safety, and efficacy of this molecule have yet to be studied in
humans.
Our in vivo pharmacokinetic study in cynomolgus monkeys
has important implications for long half-lived IgG variants in
the clinical setting. The local concentration of such an antibody variant is expected to be higher than WT due to the increase in systemic serum level, yet our work suggests that
the concentration may be further increased through tissuespecific FcRn effects when the tumor itself expresses FcRn.
Further research is needed to decipher the factors affecting
the recycling/retention properties of the variant within local
tissues or tumors, as well as how these changes in local antibody concentrations affect the potency and therapeutic
window of FcRn-binding IgG variants in humans.
