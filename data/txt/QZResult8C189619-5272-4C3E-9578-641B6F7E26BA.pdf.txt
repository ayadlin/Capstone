Abstract
Elevated expression of the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) has been associated
with a negative outcome in several cancers, although the mechanism(s) by which this receptor influences the
pathophysiology of this disease and how its activity is regulated remain unknown. Using a chemical biology
approach, it was determined that compounds, previously shown to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling, also inhibited the transcriptional activity of ERRα. The significance of this association was revealed in a series of
biochemical and genetic experiments that show that (a) ERRα, β-catenin (β-cat), and lymphoid enhancerbinding factor-1 form macromolecular complexes in cells, (b) ERRα transcriptional activity is enhanced by
β-cat expression and vice versa, and (c) there is a high level of overlap among genes previously shown to be
regulated by ERRα or β-cat. Furthermore, silencing of ERRα and β-cat expression individually or together dramatically reduced the migratory capacity of breast, prostate, and colon cancer cells in vitro. This increased
migration could be attributed to the ERRα/β-cat–dependent induction of WNT11. Specifically, using (a) conditioned medium from cells overexpressing recombinant WNT11 or (b) WNT11 neutralizing antibodies, we were
able to show that this protein was the key mediator of the promigratory activities of ERRα/β-cat. Together, these
data provide evidence for an autocrine regulatory loop involving transcriptional upregulation of WNT11 by
ERRα and β-cat that influences the migratory capacity of cancer cells. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9298–308. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα; NR3B1) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of
transcription factors whose expression tracks with a negative
outcome in breast and ovarian cancers (1–3). It is unclear
whether this ubiquitously expressed receptor requires a canonical small molecule ligand. However, under conditions
of metabolic stress, such as fasting, exercise, or cold, its expression is rapidly induced in tissues such as the heart, muscle, and
liver (4, 5). In these tissues, it directs a gene expression program
that results in increased mitochondrial number and increased
expression of key enzymes required for the tricarboxylic acid
cycle and β-oxidation of fatty acids (6–8). Thus, within the confines of normal physiology, ERRα seems to function primarily as
a regulator of metabolic function under conditions of highenergy demand (9, 10). The extent to which its role as a

metabolic regulator is involved in the pathophysiology of
cancer, however, remains to be determined (1–3).
In addition to its important role in oxidative metabolism,
ERRα can modulate the activity of the estrogen receptor (ER)
at some target genes (11). Indeed, the amino acid homology
between ERRα and the classic ERs (ERα and ERβ), particularly
in their respective DNA-binding domains, initially suggested
that the primary effect of ERRα in hormone-dependent cancers
would be to modulate or interface with estrogen signaling
pathways in cells. However, we and others have recently determined that only a relatively small percentage of ER target genes
are coregulated by ERRα (12, 13). Although the significance of
this cross talk remains to be established, the observation that
ERRα knockdown dramatically affected the in vivo growth and
in vitro migration of ER-negative MDA-MB 231 cells highlighted
an independent role for this receptor in breast cancer (13).
Crystallographic analysis of the structure of several members of the NR superfamily has indicated that the hormonebinding domain of these proteins is configured in such a way
as to create a cavity of between 360 and 1,400 A3 that serves to
dock small molecule agonists or antagonists (14). In the case
of ERRα, however, it has been shown that its potential ligand
binding cleft is occupied by the bulky side chains of four
phenylalanines and that the remaining space (100 A3) available in the pocket is likely to be too small to accommodate
a regulatory ligand (15). Furthermore, by comparison with
the structures of other agonist-activated NRs, the apoERRα

protein seems to be in the “active” conformation (15, 16). This
finding has raised the question as to how the transcriptional
activity of this receptor is regulated and whether the processes
and pathways that impinge on and activate ERRα can be
manipulated for therapeutic advantage. Cofactor availability
and activity are likely to be the primary mechanisms by
which ERRα activity is regulated (5, 17 18). It has been
shown, for instance, that the generally low basal activity of
ERRα in cells can be dramatically upregulated by increasing
the expression of either peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1) isoform PGC-1α or PGC-1β.
Indeed, the expression level and activity of these coactivators
are regulated by the physiologic stresses that have been shown
to activate ERRα transcriptional activity (19, 20). However, the
extent to which these proteins regulate ERRα activity in breast
cancer remains to be determined. Furthermore, it is unclear
what pathologic signals regulate the activity/expression of these
cofactors and whether or not there are cofactor-independent
pathways that modulate ERRα activity. The goal of this study,
therefore, was to identify pathways and processes upstream and
downstream of ERRα that effect tumor pathophysiology and
may be amenable to therapeutic manipulation.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids
The 3X-ERE-tata-luciferase reporter and pcDNA3-PGC-1α
2X9 were previously described (21). pCMV-β-gal (Clontech),
pcDNA (Invitrogen), and pBlueScriptII (Statagene) were purchased. pCMX-ΔN89 and TOP-Flash were gifts (Dr. B. Hogan,
Duke University). The pMSCV-GFP-hWNT11 plasmid was generated by subcloning WNT11 cDNA (MGC:141946) into
pENTR3c (Invitrogen) and recombining into pMSCV-IRES-GFP.
Cell culture
Cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC; 2007–2009), expanded for two passages,
and cryopreserved. All experiments were performed with
cells of passage of <25. These cell lines were authenticated
by morphologic inspection, short tandem repeat profiling,
and Mycoplasma testing by ATCC and cultured in RPMI
[Invitrogen; MDA-MB 436 (HTB-130), SKBR3 (HTB-30),
PC-3 (CRL-1435), and HCT-116 (CCL-247)] or DMEM (Invitrogen; MDA-MB 231 (HTB-26)] supplemented with 8.5% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Sigma), 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino
acids, and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Transient
transfections were performed as described previously (22). Luciferase and β-galactosidase (β-gal) activities were measured
using a Perkin-Elmer Fusion Instrument (22).
Coimmunoprecipitation
Whole-cell extracts were prepared using nondenaturing lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 10%
glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmol/L EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Sigma)]. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using
antibodies to ERRα (21), β-catenin (β-cat; BD Biosciences),
lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF-1; Santa Cruz Bio-

technology), and mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 5 μg
antibody/500 μg whole-cell extract, 16 hours, 4°C) and proteinA/G PLUS-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 4 hours,
4°C), washed using lysis buffer three times, and heat eluted in
2× sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE,
transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by Western blotting
[ERRα (21), β-cat (EMD Biosciences), LEF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a light chain–specific secondary antibody
(Jackson Immunoresearch)].
Immunoblotting
Whole-cell extracts prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS,
1 mmol/L EDTA, protease inhibitors (Sigma)] were separated
by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and detected using the following antibodies: ERRα
(21), β-cat, (BD Biosciences), WNT11 (Abcam), autophagy protein 5 (ATG5; Cell Signaling), lamin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Adenoviral transduction
Adenoviruses expressing β-gal, PGC-1α, PGC-1α 2×9, or
PGC-1α L2L3M were generated as described previously
(21). MDA-MB 231 cells were infected at multiplicity of infection of 30 for 48 hours.
Gene silencing
Chemical small interfering RNAs (siRNA; Invitrogen, Qiagen)
were used to silence ERRα (siERRα A, HSS103381; siERRα B,
HSS103382), β-cat (siβ-cat A, HSS102460; siβ-cat B, HSS102461),
WNT11 (siWNT11 A, SI00763378; siWNT11 B, SI03148719), serum
glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1; siSGK1 A, HSS109684; siSGK1 B,
HSS109685), or ATG5 (siATG5 A, HSS114103; siATG5 B,
HSS114104). Control siRNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2. MDA-MB 231 cells were seeded (250,000 per
six-well plate), and siRNAs were transfected using Dharmafect1
(Dharmacon; 100 nmol/L, 48 hours).
RNA preparation and analysis
Total RNA was isolated using the Bio-Rad Aurum RNA purification kit. cDNA was synthesized from 1μg total RNA using
iScript (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed
[0.25 μL cDNA, 0.3 μmol/L primers (Supplementary Table S1)
with iQ SYBRGreen supermix (Bio-Rad)], and results were
calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as described previously (additional details in Supplementary Materials and Methods) using primer sequences
listed in Supplementary Table S3.
WNT11 retroviral overexpression
pMSCV-IRES-GFP-hWNT11 and pMSCV-IRES-GFP-Gal4DBD (control) were cotransfected (FuGene, Roche Applied
Science) with the pCL10A1 packaging vector (Imigenex) into

293TS cells. These viral supernatants were clarified, polybrene supplemented (8 μg/mL), and used to infect MDAMB 231 cells for two serial 24-hour infections. Positive cells
were selected by three rounds of cell sorting for GFP expression, yielding the MDA-MB 231/Control (C) and MDA-MB
231/WNT11 cell lines.
Migration and viability assays
For migration assays, cells were serum starved [18 hours,
DMEM (MDA-MB 231) or RPMI (MDA-MB 436, PC-3, and
HCT-116) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mmol/L
HEPES], and 2 × 104 cells (MDA-MB 231, MDA-MB 436, and
PC-3) or 7.5 × 104 cells (HCT-116) in 100 μL were plated (BD
Biocoat Control Inserts 8.0 micron, BD Biosciences), collagen
coated (HCT-116), and migrated toward 8% FBS for 4 hours
(MDA-MB 231, MDA-MB 436, and PC-3) or 16 hours (HCT116). The membrane was stained (5% crystal violet in 20%
methanol), and cells that migrated were counted. Duplicate
transwells were used, and three high-powered fields (200×)
were counted per membrane. Cell viability assays were performed in parallel with the migration studies using the Cell
Titer Blue Assay (data not shown; Promega). Cells (2 × 104 in
100 μL) were seeded in triplicate on a 96-well plate for 4 hours
followed by the addition of Cell Titer Blue dye (20 μL) for
12 hours. Resultant fluorescence at (535 nmEx, 620 nmEm)
was measured using a Perkin-Elmer Fusion Instrument. The
fluorescence was calculated as the triplicate average (±SEM)
followed by subtraction of background fluorescence from
the medium. For ERRα, β-cat, and WNT11 silencing, cells were
transfected with siRNAs as described (Gene Silencing) 48 hours
before the migration assay. For WNT11 overexpression, migration assays were performed using the stable MDA-MB 231 cell
lines, control, and WNT11. For conditioned medium (CM)
studies, MDA-MB 231 cells migrated toward CM from the
MDA-MB 231/C or MDA-MB 231/WNT11 cells.
Immunodepletion of WNT11
CM from MDA-MB 231/C and MDA-MB 231/WNT11 was
harvested at 80% confluence and was depleted of WNT11
protein by incubation with WNT11 antibody (Abcam) or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 10μg/mL, 4°C for 16 hours).
Statistical analyses
Transfection, qPCR, and migration data are represented as
mean ± SEM for three biological replicates. Significance was
evaluated by ANOVA and the Neumann-Keul's post hoc test
for migration studies (GraphPad).

Results
Cross talk between ERRα and Wnt signaling pathways
A chemical biology approach was used to define how ERRα is
engaged in the regulation of pathways and processes of pathologic importance in cancer. Specifically, a high-throughput
cell-based assay was used to identify compounds that modulate the transcriptional activity of the PGC-1α/ERRα complex
in MDA-MB 436 cells (ERα negative). Among the most interesting compounds identified in this manner were the carbolines

(harmol, harmine, harmane, and 6-methoxyharmalan), all of
which inhibited ERRα transcriptional activity when assayed
on a simple reporter (Supplementary Fig. S1). Previously, it
has been shown that these carbolines could inhibit the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and, in doing so, enhance peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activity in
adipogenesis assays in vitro (23). Given these data and the established role(s) of Wnt signaling in cell migration and invasion
(24, 25), together with our previously published data, which implicates ERRα in this biological process (13), it seemed likely
that both effectors were components of the same pathway.
As an initial step in our analysis, we evaluated the effect
of ERRα expression on the transcriptional activity of a

constitutively active β-cat mutant when assayed on the TOPFlash [T-cell factor (TCF)/LEF] luc-reporter. As shown in
Fig. 1A, ERRα expression had a minimal effect on the basal
expression of the reporter. However, a robust enhancement
of β-cat–dependent transcriptional activity was observed on
ERRα expression. Similarly, expression of β-cat significantly
enhanced the activity of ERRα when assayed on the 3X-EREtata-luc reporter (Fig. 1A). As expected, β-cat increased the
basal activity of this reporter by enhancing the transcriptional

activity of the endogeneous ERRα levels expressed in SKBR3
cells. The pathway cross talk revealed in these transcriptional
assays was further reinforced in a series of biochemical studies, which indicated that ERRα, β-cat, and LEF-1 physically
interact (Fig. 1C). Specifically, we were able to show by coimmunoprecipitation studies performed with endogenously expressed proteins from SKBR3, MDA-MB 231, or MDA-MB 436
(data not shown) breast cancer cells that ERRα interacted
with both β-cat and LEF-1. We confirmed the direct nature

of these interactions using glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, using both chemical and biochemical approaches, we determined that the
Wnt/β-cat and ERRα signaling pathways converge, a finding
of likely importance in cancer pathogenesis.
Both ERRα- and β-cat–regulated signaling pathways
influence the migratory capacity of cancer cells
ERRα and β-cat have both been shown in independent
studies to function as regulators of cancer cell migration
(13, 25). Thus, given that these proteins physically interact
and exhibit functional cross talk at the level of transcription,
it seemed likely that they may also cooperate in the regulation of pathways that regulate cell migration. Thus, we evaluated the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERRα and
β-cat, individually or combined, on the migratory capacity of
multiple cancer cell lines including breast (MDA-MB 231 and
MDA-MB 436), prostate (PC-3), and colon (HCT-116) cells using a Boyden chamber migration assay. Decreased cell migration was observed after silencing of ERRα or β-cat expression
by either of two distinct siRNAs directed against each target,
and this activity was further reduced when the expression of
both proteins was knocked down simultaneously (Fig. 2A). Additionally, migration of MDA-MB 231 and PC-3 cells was not
significantly affected by silencing of SGK1 or ATG5, a key component of autophagy with no known function in migration
(Supplementary Fig. S3). No significant differences in cell viability were observed in cells treated with the selected siRNAs
(data not shown) under the conditions used for the migration
assays. The efficacy of each of the siRNAs in reducing the expression of their respective targets was confirmed by Western
immunoblot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Furthermore,
treatment with the inverse agonist XCT790 resulted in a dosedependent degradation of ERRα and an inhibition of MDA-MB
231, MDA-MB 436, PC-3, and HCT-116 cell migration (Fig. 2B;
Supplementary Fig. S4B) with no significant changes in cell
viability (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate

9302

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

that both ERRα and β-cat can promote the migratory capacity
of several types of cancer cells.
ERRα regulates the expression of target genes
encoding proteins with promigratory activities
In light of the cross talk between the ERRα and β-cat signaling pathways observed, we next asked whether these proteins cooperated in the regulation of genes involved in the
migratory response. In previously published work, we used
classic microarray analysis to identify ERRα target genes that
were expressed in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells (6, 13, 26). Likewise,
there are published studies that describe the β-cat transcriptome in 293T cells (26). With these data sets in hand, we were
able to perform a comparative analysis and identify genes that
(a) were regulated in both data sets and (b) were important for
cell migration as shown in previous studies (26–31). In this
manner, WNT11, MSX1, and N-cadherin were identified as
genes that are likely to be coregulated by ERRα and β-cat.
The expression of WNT11, MSX1, and N-cadherin was next
evaluated in MDA-MB 231 cells following the activation of
ERRα. Whereas the transcriptional activity of ERRα is regulated by the relative expression and/or activity of cofactors
such as PGC-1α and PGC-1β (19, 20), other NRs, including
PPARγ and HNF-4, can also be coactivated by PGC-1α, which
makes it difficult to study the ERRα signaling axis in isolation
using this cofactor as an activator (19, 32). To circumvent this
problem, we developed a variant of PGC-1α (PGC-1α 2 × 9)
that interacts in a highly selective manner with ERRα and thus
can be used to specifically regulate the activity of this receptor
(6). In addition, when analyzing ERRα target gene expression
using PGC-1α as an activator, we also evaluated the effect of
an inactive variant of PGC-1α (PGC-1α L2L3M) in parallel.
MDA-MB 231 cells were transduced with adenoviruses expressing βgal, PGC-1α, PGC-1α 2 × 9, or PGC-1α L2L3M, and
quantitative PCR was used to assess the resulting changes in
mRNA expression of target genes (Fig. 3). It was determined
that ERRα mRNA levels are increased on overexpression of

PGC-1α (wild-type or 2 × 9), consistent with it being an autoregulated gene (33). Similarly, GSTM1, an ERRα target gene
(12), was also regulated by PGC-1α, whereas β-cat mRNA
levels were not significantly affected (Fig. 3). Interestingly,
WNT11, MSX1, and N-cadherin were all significantly induced
by the expression of PGC-1α in MDA-MB 231 cells (Fig. 3).
Similar results were observed in MDA-MB 436, PC-3, and
HCT-116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Coregulation of WNT11, MSX1, and N-cadherin by
ERRα and β-cat
The relative importance of ERRα and β-cat in the regulation of WNT11, MSX1, and N-cadherin was next evaluated.

Specifically, the expression of each mRNA and appropriate
controls were measured in cells following the introduction
of siRNAs directed against ERRα or β-cat. Using two different siRNAs against each target, we observed that silencing of
either ERRα or β-cat led to a significant diminution of
WNT11, MSX1, and N-cadherin mRNA expression. Simultaneous knockdown of both mRNAs in MDA-MB 231 cells resulted in a further decrease in the expression level of these
mRNAs (Fig. 4A). Importantly, silencing of β-cat expression
did not affect the mRNA level of GSTM1 (Fig. 4A), suggesting
that not all ERRα target genes are regulated by β-cat (see
Discussion). Notably, ERRα and β-cat downregulation, either
singly or in combination, resulted in a reduction of WNT11

protein levels (Fig. 4B). Given the extremely robust regulation
of WNT11 mRNA expression by ERRα and β-cat and its previously described activity as a promigratory factor (28–30),
we focused the remainder of the studies on defining the
mechanism by which this gene is regulated and how it affects
cancer cell biology.
The next step in these studies was to define the mechanism(s) by which ERRα and β-cat regulate WNT11 expression.
To this end, we scanned the genomic sequence surrounding
the WNT11 gene using Consite for putative TCF and ERRα response elements (Supplementary Fig. S6A). ChIP assays in
MDA-MB 231 cells were then used to confirm the functionality
of the putative ERRα and/or TCF binding sites. In this manner,
significant binding of both ERRα and β-cat was detected at
the following two sites: P6 (-3042) and D5 (+27794; Fig. 4C;
Supplementary Fig. S6B). Importantly, siRNA-mediated
knockdown of ERRα expression significantly reduced β-cat
binding at the P6 site, and knockdown of β-cat reduced ERRα
binding (Fig. 4C). These ChIP data provide a molecular explanation for the observed cross talk that occurs between ERRα
and β-cat on the WNT11 gene.
WNT11 acts in an autocrine manner to promote
cancer cell migration
Previous studies have highlighted the promigratory activity of WNT11 in biological contexts, including migration of
intestinal epithelial cells, neural crest cells, and gastrulation
(28–30); however, little has been done to define the role of
WNT11 in cellular models of cancer. To address this issue,
we used siRNAs to knock down WNT11 expression in
MDA-MB 231 cells and used transwell migration assays to
define the effect of this manipulation on cell migration. As
shown in Fig. 5A, using either of two different siRNAs, we
were able to achieve a quantitative knockdown of WNT11
protein expression, a manipulation that resulted in an
∼60% reduction in cell migration. We did not observe any
effect of WNT11 knockdown on total cell number and/or cell
viability under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 5A).
This effect was not restricted to MDA-231 cells, as we observed
that silencing of WNT11 expression also decreased migration
of MDA-MB 436, PC-3, and HCT-116 cells when assayed in the
same manner (Supplementary Fig. S7). These overexpression
data provide a strong support that WNT11 is promoting migration, as this could not be a survival effect. To complement
these experiments, we created WNT11-overexpressing derivatives of MDA-MB 231 cells and determined that the increased
production in both total and secreted WNT11 protein correlated
with a significant increase in cell migration (Fig. 5B). Together,
these experiments suggest that the ERRα/β-cat–dependent
target WNT11 acts in an autocrine manner to increase the
migration of cancer cells.
Given that WNT11 is a secreted protein that functions by
binding to the extracellular frizzled receptor 7 (30), we also
tested whether exogenously added WNT11 could restore the
reduced migratory phenotype resulting from the silencing of
ERRα and β-cat in the MDA-MB 231 parent cell line. For these
experiments, we isolated the CM from MDA-MB 231 cells (containing vector alone) or from cells that were engineered to

Figure 6. WNT11 partially restores reduced MDA-MB 231 migration by
silencing of ERRα and β-cat. MDA-MB 231 cells were transfected with
siC or siERRα and β-cat and serum starved as previously described.
Migration assays were then performed with CM from the MDA-MB 231
derivative cell lines overexpressing WNT11 or empty vector. Immunodepletion
of WNT11 from CM reduced migration compared with mock
immunodepletion with rabbit IgG. Different letters denote significance

overexpress WNT11. Subsequently, CM was added to the lower
chamber of a transwell plate and MDA-MB 231 cells treated
with control siRNA (siC) or siERRα and siβ-cat were added
to the upper chamber. In cells treated with siC, addition of
CM from WNT11-overexpressing cells did not significantly
increase cell migration, probably due to the sufficiently high
concentration of WNT11 already in the medium in control
cells. However, immunodepletion of WNT11 from WNT11overexpressing CM significantly reduced the migration of
these cells, indicating that WNT11 is a promigratory factor
(Fig. 6). Importantly, CM from WNT11-overexpressing cells
partially reversed the decreased migration resulting from
knockdown of ERRα and β-cat. Furthermore, immunodepletion of WNT11 from this CM using a specific antibody,
but not with an irrelevant antibody, blocked this restorative
capacity. Similar results were obtained using WNT11 and
empty vector CM from mouse L-cell fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S8). Together, these data provide compelling
evidence for a regulatory loop involving ERRα, β-cat, and
WNT11 that influences the migratory capacity in this model
of breast cancer.

Discussion
Cross talk between NRs and the Wnt/β-cat signaling pathway has been shown previously (34). In the realm of metabolism, it has been shown that cross talk between PPARγ and
Wnt/β-cat signaling enables precise control of adipogenesis
resulting from a reciprocal inhibition of each other's transcriptional activities (35). It has been shown that β-cat serves
as an androgen receptor (AR) coactivator when assessed on
endogenous AR target genes such as PSA (36). Cross talk between the Wnt pathway and ERα, LRH-1, retinoid X receptor,
and several other NRs has also been shown to occur in a

Dwyer et al.

variety of cell-based assays (34, 37). In this study, we provide
compelling evidence that ERRα and β-cat are involved in the
regulation of WNT11, MSX1, and N-cadherin expression,
genes implicated previously in processes that regulate cell
migration. Given the wealth of literature linking WNT11 to
cell migration, we focused on evaluating the functional consequences of ERRα/β-cat–mediated regulation of WNT11
(28–30). In this manner, we were able to determine that
WNT11 is important for migration in breast cancer cells,
and its expression is influenced by both ERRα and β-cat.
Wnt signaling occurs via a canonical or a noncanonical
pathway, both of which may interface with ERRα/β-cat (38, 39).
In the canonical pathway, Wnt activation of Fzd results
in disheveled-mediated degradation of axin and GSK-3β
inhibition. Inhibition of this destruction complex leads to an
increase in the intracellular pool of β-cat. The stabilized β-cat
has two nonexclusive fates within the cell. Firstly, the protein
can translocate to the nucleus, where it regulates target gene
expression through its interaction with the TCF/LEF family
of transcription factors. Alternatively, β-cat can interact with
E-cadherin in adherens junctions and stabilize cell-cell interactions. Furthermore, β-cat expression promotes epithelialto-mesenchymal transition, a process that is frequently associated
with the loss of E-cadherin. Importantly, it has been shown
that inhibition of E-cadherin expression increases nuclear
β-cat, resulting in the increased expression of promigratory
genes (40). Thus, depending on the relative partitioning of
β-cat, it can have either a positive or a negative effect on cell
migration. We have established that the ERRα, a karyophilic
protein, associates directly with β-cat; thus, it is possible that,
in addition to cooperating with β-cat in the transcriptional
regulation of promigratory genes, ERRα may affect migration
by regulating the cellular partitioning of β-cat. In many breast
cancer cells, including the MDA-MB 231 cells studied herein,
E-cadherin expression is extremely low, and thus, it is likely
that the effects we have observed on migration are a direct consequence of the nuclear action of the ERRα/β-cat complex (41).
Defining the processes that impinge on and regulate the nuclear
versus cytoplasmic actions of the ERRα/β-cat is a focus of our
continued efforts in this area.
In this study, we have performed a comprehensive analysis
of the mechanisms underlying the ERRα/β-cat–dependent
regulation of WNT11. Whereas we can show that both of
these proteins interact in cells and can bind to the same
region in the WNT11 gene, we do not know if they bind to
adjacent sites or if a tethering mechanism is involved. Given
that other NRs use both mechanisms to engage target genes,
it is likely that both types of interaction, direct and tethering,
are used. To address this issue, we have performed a preliminary examination of available ChIP-ChIP and ChIP-seq data
sets to evaluate the extent to which the binding sites described for ERRα and β-cat converge. In this manner, we
found a small but significant overlap in target genes that were
found to be enriched for ERRα binding in MCF-7 or SKBR3
breast cancer cells by ChIP-ChIP analysis and those that were
found to be enriched for β-cat binding in HCT116 colon cancer
cells by ChIP-seq analysis (Supplementary Fig. S9A; refs. 12, 42).
Furthermore, out of the 547 unique ERRα-regulated genes

9306

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

detected in our previously published MCF-7 microarray
study, 39 of these genes were found to contain at least one
β-cat–enriched region in the HCT116 ChIP-seq experiment
(Supplementary Fig. S9B; refs. 13, 42). Finally, bioinformatic
analyses using Patser revealed that of the 988 β-cat target
genes identified in the HCT116 ChIP-seq experiment, ∼17%
of the genes also contain at least one putative ERR binding
site within the same 600-bp region of DNA that is enriched
for β-cat binding (Supplementary Fig. S9C; refs. 42–44).
The significance and functionality of the convergent sites
identified in this manner are currently under investigation.
The identification of WNT11 as a direct transcriptional
target of the ERRα/β-cat complex was of particular interest
to us as (a) the expression of this protein has previously been
associated with increased cell migration (28–30, 45); (b) WNT11
is upregulated in several cancers, including colorectal, prostate,
and breast cancer (46, 47); and (c) WNT11 induces transformation of mammary epithelial cells (48). WNT11, initially
identified as a noncanonical Wnt, can activate the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, resulting in G protein–dependent increases in intracellular calcium and subsequent activation of
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII)
and protein kinase C (PKC; ref. 28). This activity has been
shown to increase intestinal epithelial cellular migration
(28–30, 46, 48). Interestingly, both CAMKII and PKC facilitate
actin cytoskeleton rearrangements that are critical for cellular
migration (49). Furthermore, WNT11 has been shown to also
activate the canonical Wnt pathway (50). The fact that noncanonical pathway activation of PKC can result in decreased
E-cadherin function further underscores the significance of
the cross talk between canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling and the likely importance of the ERRα/β-cat complex
in this process.
Taken together, our findings provide evidence for an autocrine regulatory loop involving transcriptional upregulation
of WNT11 by ERRα and β-cat, an activity that influences
the migratory capacity of cancer cells. Furthermore, these
data provide a strong rationale for the development of compounds that inhibit ERRα or the activity of the ERRα/β-cat
complex as cancer therapeutics.
