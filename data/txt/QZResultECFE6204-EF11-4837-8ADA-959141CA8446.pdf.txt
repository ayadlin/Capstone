BACKGROUND: NR4A2, an orphan nuclear receptor essential in the generation of dopaminergic neurons, has been recently linked to
inflammation and cancer. This study sought to identify the role of NR4A2 on chemoresistance and postoperative prognosis of gastric
cancer (GC). METHODS: NR4A2 was transfected into GC cells to investigate its effects on chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil and the
tumorigenicity in nude mice. This study also investigated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced NR4A2 expression and its effect on chemoresistance. Surgical specimens from patients with stage I through III GC were examined immunohistochemically for NR4A2 expression. Median follow-up time was 76 months for 245 patients. RESULTS: Ectopic expression of NR4A2 significantly increased the
chemoresistance and attenuated 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. Transient treatment of GC cells with PGE2 significantly upregulated
NR4A2 expression via the protein kinase A pathway and increased the chemoresistance. Ectopic expression of NR4A2 significantly
increased the tumorigenicity. In clinical samples, NR4A2 was preferentially expressed in lymphocytes and epithelial cytoplasm in adjacent mucosa. High expression of NR4A2 (immunoreactive score  3) in cancer cells significantly predicted an unfavorable postoperative disease-specific survival of patients with stage I to III GC (P 5.011), especially for those who received 5-fluorouracil-based
chemotherapy (P 5.016). This effect was not found in those without the chemotherapy. In multivariate Cox analyses, age, TNM (tumor/node/metastasis) stage, and high NR4A2 expression significantly predicted an unfavorable postoperative survival. CONCLUSIONS: High NR4A2 expression in GC cells confers chemoresistance, attenuates 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis, and predicts an
unfavorable survival, especially for those who received chemotherapy. NR4A2 might serve as a prognostic and predictive factor and

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common cancer in men and the fifth in women worldwide, and more than 70% of
new cases and deaths occur in developing countries.1 Surgery in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy remains the
mainstay of curative treatment. However, a subset of patients will relapse and/or develop metachronous metastases. To
characterize this heterogeneity, it is necessary to develop prognostic and/or predictive markers useful in identifying
patients with GC who will benefit from adjuvant therapies after surgery, thus leading to an improved prognosis.
Convincing epidemiological and experimental evidences have demonstrated that chronic infection with Helicobacter
pylori, environmental insults, and host immune response work synergistically to maintain inflammation, driving the initiation and progression of mucosal atrophy, metaplasia, and dysplasia toward GC.2 Bacterial infection and prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) signaling are required for gastric carcinogenesis.3 Chronic inflammation contributes not only to carcinogenesis, but also to poor postoperative prognosis of GC.4 Daily aspirin significantly reduces death risk from cancers, including
GC.5 Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have beneficial effects on preventing inflammation-related

carcinogenesis and on the regression of advanced GC.6,7
COX-2 induces the production of PGE2, which upregulates NR4A2 expression via sequential activation of the
Rho, protein kinase A (PKA), and nuclear factor-jB signaling pathways.8
NR4A2 (also termed as Nurr1), a transcription factor belonging to orphan nuclear receptor family 4 subgroup A (NR4A) superfamily, is essential in the
generation of dopaminergic neurons and is involved in
neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease.8,9
NR4A2 is pivotal for the induction and function of regulatory T cell and implicated in autoimmune diseases such
as rheumatoid arthritis.10,11 NR4A2 is an immediate early
gene induced by PGE2 and promotes cancer cell survival
via inhibiting apoptosis.12 NR4A2 activates the promoter
of osteopontin (OPN), an important molecule promoting
tumor progression and angiogenesis in many cancer types.
Selective COX-2 inhibitors downregulate OPN, probably
via blockade of NR4A2 and Wnt/b-catenin signaling.13
Downregulation of NR4A2 reduced anchorageindependent growth of cancer cells and promoted intrinsic apoptosis.14 Our previous study using a complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray found that NR4A2 was
upregulated in adjacent gastric mucosa tissues compared
to that in GC tissues.15 Wnt/b-catenin signaling and bcatenin target molecule cyclin D1 are important in promoting GC progression and chemoresistance.16-18 We
hypothesize that NR4A2 is activated in an inflammatory
microenvironment, participates in an evolutionary process from inflammation to cancer via affecting PKA and/
or OPN-b-catenin-cyclin D1 pathways, and promotes
the progression of GC. However, the role of NR4A2 in
the pathogenesis of GC remains unknown.
Here, we report that NR4A2 expression conferred
chemoresistance and predicted an unfavorable postoperative prognosis of patients who have stage I through III
GC, especially for those who received chemotherapy.
These novel findings may shed light on the role of
NR4A2 in chemoresistance and provide a predictive and
prognostic factor for GC prognosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
NR4A2 Transfection

Two representative human GC cell lines—AGS, which is
derived from an intestinal-type moderately differentiated
gastric adenocarcinoma,19 and HGC-27, which is derived
from a lymph node metastasis of a potential diffuse-type
undifferentiated gastric carcinoma20—were purchased
from ATCC (Manassas, Va) and Cell Bank, Chinese
Cancer

Academy of Science (Shanghai, China), respectively, 6
weeks before our in vitro study. These cell lines have been
characterized by karyotyping in the cell banks and were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 lg/mL) in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 C.
A full-length human NR4A2 cDNA (GenBank:BC009288) in pOTB7 vector was purchased from
Open Biosystems (Waltham, Mass) and released by
BamHI/XhoI digestion and then inserted into pCDNA
3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif)
to construct a NR4A2 expression vector TOPO-NR4A2.
A total of 105 cells were transfected by TOPO-NR4A2 or
empty TOPO-vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and were selected in the presence of 1 mg/mL G418
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo). The G418-resistant cells
were not subcloned. Cell invasive ability and anchorageindependent growth of the transfected cells were examined as described.21
Real-Time Quantitative Reverse-Transcription
PCR and Western Blot

Total RNA was isolated and subjected for quantitative
real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) as described,15 and primers for NR4A2 were
described.15 Primers used for OPN were (forward)

Abcam, Cambridge, UK), cyclin D1 (2261-1, 1:1000;
Abcam), and b-actin (3700, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), according to our previous protocol.21
Chemoresistance

The NR4A2-transfected cells, empty TOPO-vector transfected cells, and parental cells were seeded in 96-well
plates (5 3 103 per well) and allowed to grow for 24 hours,
3437

Original Article

then treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Sigma) at various
concentrations for 24 hours. Number of viable cells was
assayed using WST tetrazolium salt (CCK-8; Dojindo,
Shanghai, China) as described.22
PGE2 Treatment

AGS and HGC-27 cells were allowed to grow in FBS-free
media for 24 hours. The starved cells were treated with 10
lM H-89 (a selective inhibitor of cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]/PKA) (Sigma), 10 lM NS398 (a
selective inhibitor of COX-2) (Sigma), or dimethyl sulfoxide (control) for 1 hour, and then treated with 10 lM
PGE2 (Sigma) for 4 hours. The expression of NR4A2 was
measured using qRT-PCR and western blot.
Fluorouracil-Induced Apoptosis

The TOPO-NR4A2-transfected cells, 10 lM PGE2induced cells, and TOPO-vector tranfected cells (5 3 103
per well) were incubated with 5-FU at the median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of TOPO-vector transfected
cells for 24 hours. The cells were then fixed with methanol-acetic acid followed by staining with 100 lL Hoechst
33258 staining reagent (Beyotime, Haimen, China) in
the dark for 30 minutes. After being washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline, cells were immediately photographed with excitation wavelength of 340 to 360 nm to
determine ratios of apoptotic cells.
Animal Implantation

Three- to 4-week-old male BALB/c nude mice were purchased from the Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai,
China) and maintained under pathogen-free conditions.
After 1 week adaptable feeding, approximately 1 3 106
TOPO-NR4A2-transfected HGC-27 cells and TOPOvector-transfected counterparts were subcutaneously
implanted into the nape region. Tumor sizes were measured once a week and calculated as described.23 This
experiment was performed in accordance with recommendations for the proper care and use of laboratory animals
and approved by the ethics committee of this university.
GC Patients and Postoperative Follow-Up

Consecutive patients with stage I through III GC who
received curative surgery at Dr. Liye Ma’s surgery group,
Department of General Surgery, Changhai Hospital
(Shanghai, China) from March 2001 to December 2005
were enrolled in this study. The diagnoses were pathologically confirmed. Clinicopathological variables before
surgery and chemotherapy were documented. We
excluded such patients as those with concurrent malignant
diseases and those who received radiotherapy, lost contact

information, died of other causes, and refused to join the
study. Follow-up was performed every 6 months by inperson interview at our outpatient department and/or by
telephone calls according to our standard epidemiologic
procedure. Death from GC relapse was defined as an
event, and patients were censored at the last follow-up.
Median follow-up time was 76 months (interquartile
range, 25-89 months). The final date of follow-up was
November 30, 2012. A total of 245 patients with stage I
through III GC who had intact follow-up information
and intact NR4A2 immunohistochemistry data were
involved in survival analysis. We also acquired freshly frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor
specimens and their paired adjacent mucosa specimens
from 28 patients with GC who received surgery at the
same surgery group for comparative analysis of NR4A2
expression. This protocol conformed to the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the Second Military Medical University, Shanghai,
China. Informed consent was obtained from the subject(s) and/or guardian(s).
Immunohistochemistry

The FFPE specimens of primary GCs were examined by
immunohistochemistry for NR4A2 expression. The specimens were processed basically according to a previous protocol.24 Polyclonal antibody against NR4A2 (ab60149,
1:50; Abcam) was used for immunostaining.15 Immunostains were independently examined by 4 researchers
(Y.H., H.C., Y.Y., and G.C.) who were blind to clinical
information. Immunostaining intensity was rated as
0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (intense). The
extent of positive tumor cells was graded as 0 (0%-4%),
1 (5%-24%), 2 (25%-49%), 3 (50%-74%), and 4 (75%100%). The intensity and the extent were multiplied for
each score. Because the expression of NR4A2 occurred in
a patchy pattern in some specimens, we randomly selected
3 visual fields in each section and scored each visual field.
A mean score of the 3 visual fields was given to each specimen. Specimens of the first 150 patients were applied to
optimize a cutoff of immunoreactive score ranging from 0
to 12 by Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test. The
score of 3 was set as the cutoff point that best dichotomized patients into high-risk and low-risk groups.
Statistics

Differences in categorical variables were examined using
the chi-square test. Differences in continual variables were
tested by Student t test. IC50 value was determined by
probit analysis. The correlation of immunoreactive score

with each clinical factor was determined by Spearman
rank test. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test was
used to estimate the survival. Univariate Cox regression
analysis was used to obtain hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval of factors that were significantly associated
with disease-specific survival. Multivariate Cox hazard
model was employed to determine factors contributing
significantly to the survival. All statistical tests were 2sided and conducted using SPSS version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, Ill). P < .05 was defined as statistically significant.
RESULTS
Ectopic Overexpression of NR4A2 Increased the
Tumorigenicity of GC Cells

Following the transfection with TOPO-NR4A2, NR4A2
expression was significantly upregulated in AGS and
HGC-27 cells at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, whereas expression of OPN was significantly upregulated in AGS cells at mRNA and protein levels,
compared with the empty-vector controls (Fig. 1). Ectopic
expression of NR4A2 did not significantly affect invasion

ability and anchorage-independent growth of these cells in
vitro (data not shown). HGC-27 cells stably formed aggressive tumors in nude mice. Ectopic expression of NR4A2
significantly increased the tumorigenicity (Fig. 2).
Ectopic Expression of NR4A2 Increased
Chemoresistance and Conferred Resistance to
5-FU-Induced Apoptosis

NR4A2-transfected AGS, empty-vector-transfected AGS,
and parental cells were examined for their sensitivity to 5FU, resulting in IC50 concentrations of 250.2 lg/mL,
181.9 lg/mL, and 125.0 lg/mL, respectively. The IC50
concentrations of 5-FU in NR4A2-transfected HGC-27,
empty-vector-transfected HGC-27, and parental cells
were 322.6 lg/mL, 146.5 lg/mL, and 127.4 lg/mL,
respectively. Ectopic expression of NR4A2 significantly
increased the chemoresistance of both cell lines to 5-FU
(Fig. 3A). The ratio of apoptotic cells in empty-vectortransfected AGS cells was significantly higher than that in
NR4A2-transfected AGS cells, after being exposed to
5-FU at the IC50 concentration of empty-vectortransfected cells (53.6% 6 12.1% versus 21.2% 6 6.9%,
P 5 .016). The same was true in HGC-27 cells
(23.4% 6 2.7% versus 7.6% 6 1.7%, P 5 .010) (Fig. 3B).
PGE2 Induced NR4A2 Expression via PKA
Pathway and Conferred Chemoresistance

The expression of NR4A2 in both GC cells was significantly up-regulated by transient PGE2 treatment, moreover, the expression of NR4A2 was significantly blocked
by H-89 at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4A).
Interestingly, PGE2-induced NR4A2 expression was significantly associated with an increased chemoresistance to
5-FU at all concentrations in AGS cells but only at high
concentration in HGC-27 cells (Fig. 4B).

In the paired freshly frozen GC and adjacent mucosa tissues of 28 patients, NR4A2 expression was higher in adjacent mucosa than in GCs as measured by qRT-PCR
(P 5 .002). This was consistent with our previous finding.15 Immunohistochemistry of the 28 paired FFPE
specimens indicated that the ratio of positive NR4A2 immunostaining in adjacent mucosa was 64.3% in lymphocyte nuclei, 39.3% in epithelial cytoplasm, and 25.0% in
epithelial nuclei; the ratio in tumors was 14.3% in lymphocyte nuclei, 0% in cancer cytoplasm, and 53.6% in

not in those without the chemotherapy (Fig. 6C). Table 2
depicts the contribution of NR4A2 expression in cancer
cells and clinicopathological variables to disease-specific
survival in multivariate Cox regression analyses. High
expression of NR4A2 in cancer cells significantly predicted an unfavorable prognosis, and this effect was independent of age and advanced TNM stage.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we presented a line of evidence to elucidate
the effect of NR4A2 in GC. The major findings of this
study were that NR4A2 expression in cancer cells conferred chemoresistance to 5-FU, attenuated 5-FUinduced apoptosis, promoted the tumorigenicity in nude
mice, and contributed to an unfavorable prognosis in GC
patients, especially for those who received postoperative
chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
elucidate the role of NR4A2 in GC.
NR4A2 expression was increased up to 5-fold in
AGS cells and approximately 2.5-fold in HGC-27 cells at
the mRNA levels under the same transfection condition
Cancer

October 1, 2013

(Fig. 1). The NR4A2-transfected AGS cells exhibited a
stronger chemoresistance to 5-FU, compared to that of
NR4A2-transfected HGC-27 cells (Fig. 3). The same was
true for the correlation between PGE2-induced NR4A2
expression and the chemoresistance (Fig. 4). These “doseresponse” effects reflex an actual role of NR4A2 in chemoresistance. OPN is a direct target of NR4A2 in AGS cells
rather than in HGC-27 cells with a high background level
of OPN (Fig. 1). It is understandable that HGC-27
derived from metastatic GC has a high level of OPN that
facilitates GC metastasis.25 Wnt/b-catenin-cyclin D1
might be important in the development of chemoresistance.16 Ectopic expression of NR4A2 did not affect the
expression of b-catenin and cyclin D1 in both GC cell lines
(Fig. 1), indicating that NR4A2 and Wnt/b-catenin might
represent distinct pathways involved in chemoresistance.
To comprehend the complex process of GC progression, attention should be paid to effective accommodation
of cancer cells against inflammatory microenvironment.
Ectopic expression of NR4A2 did not affect the growth of
GC cells in vitro but significantly increased the tumorigenicity in vivo (Fig. 2), indicating the importance of the
microenvironment in GC progression. The COX-2/PGE2

pathway links cancer cells with the inflammatory microenvironment. Transient treatment with PGE2 significantly
induced NR4A2 expression in GC cells, and the NR4A2
induction was blocked by a selective inhibitor of PKA
(Fig. 4A), indicating that exogenous PGE2 promotes
NR4A2 expression in a cAMP/PKA-dependent manner.
The cAMP/PKA signaling pathway also links chronic
inflammation and cancers.26 A selective inhibitor of COX2 did not block NR4A2 expression induced by PGE2,
indicating that COX-2 is an upstream element of the
PGE2-PKA-NR4A2 axis. Our immunohistochemistry
3442

results showed that expression patterns of NR4A2 in adjacent mucosa and in tumors were different, and NR4A2
was preferentially expressed in lymphocytes and epithelial
cytoplasm in adjacent mucosa tissues (Fig. 5). NR4A2 regulates CD41 T cells by inducing Foxp3 and strongly
repressing Th1 cytokine production.10 This may contribute to immunosuppression and chronic inflammation, the
latter of which promotes PGE2 production. Ectopic
expression of NR4A2 promotes the production of interleukin-8,27 an important inflammation-promoting Th2
cytokine. The feedback loop of PGE2-NR4A2 may play

exhibited a significant resistance to 5-FU-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4). PGE2-mediated protection from apoptosis can
be completely inhibited by a dominant-negative NR4A2
construct; moreover, downregulation of NR4A2 can promote intrinsic apoptosis in several cancer cell lines.12,14,28

nuclear in cancer cells (Fig. 5). However, cytoplasmic mislocalization of NR4A2 has been related to a poor prognosis of bladder cancer.29 The function of NR4A2 in
different subcellular localization should be further elucidated. Because NR4A2 expression confers chemoresistance, the chemotherapy may select a subset of cancer cells
with high NR4A2 expression, and these cancer cells might
be major populations of cancer recurrence. Targeting
NR4A2 pathway might be an alternative to improve the
effect of postoperative chemotherapy. Thus, this study
provides a new predictive and prognostic biomarker for
postoperative outcome of patients with GC and also a
candidate therapeutic target to improve GC prognosis.
Our study has limitations. First, the mechanism by
which NR4A2 confers chemoresistance remains to be
clarified. Constitutive activation of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) family is associated with PGE2induced NR4A2 expression and chemoresistance in oral
squamous cell carcinoma.30 EGFR is able to predict GC
prognosis.31 The role of EGFR and its related somatic
mutations in PGE2-induced NR4A2 expression and chemoresistance should be investigated. Second, we did not
find a difference in invasion and anchorage-independent
growth among the GC cells transfected with NR4A2, parental cells, and those with NR4A2 downregulation by
short hairpin RNA in our preliminary study (data not
shown). However, ectopic expression of NR4A2 significantly increased the tumorigenicity in nude mice (Fig. 2).
Potential interaction of cancer cells with mesenchyma as a
source of this inconsistency should be elucidated. Third,
postoperative 5-FU-based chemotherapy is effective in
improving the prognosis of GC.32 However, this study
gave different data in univariate Cox analysis (Table 2),
possibly because the chemotherapy had been selectively
applied to the patients at an advanced stage (Table 1). In
addition, the survival study was retrospectively designed,
which might have introduced a selection bias.
In conclusion, the expression of NR4A2, an
orphan nuclear factor linking neurological abnormalities,
3444

inflammation, and cancers, confers the chemoresistance
to 5-FU, attenuates 5-FU-induced apoptosis, increases
the tumorigenicity of human GC cells, and predicts an
unfavorable postoperative prognosis of patients with GC,
especially for those who received postoperative chemotherapy. Although the mechanisms by which NR4A2
expression in GC confers chemoresistance remains to be
further clarified, this study provides a new predictive and
prognostic factor for postoperative prognosis of GC.
Targeting NR4A2 might be an alternative to improve the
survival of patients with GC.
