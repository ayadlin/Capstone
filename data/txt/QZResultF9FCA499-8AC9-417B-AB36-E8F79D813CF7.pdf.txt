to a frequently used regimen of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF) provided benefits with regard to overall survival, response rate, time-to-disease progression,
clinical benefit, and health-related quality of life. Although the DCF regimen provides these advantages, it is accompanied by an increase in toxicity compared
with the doublet regimen. The toxicity profile of DCF is acceptable only with
appropriately selected patients and comprehensive toxicity management strategies. The objective of the current review was to identify trials that investigated
modifications to the original DCF regimen to improve its toxicity profile and
summarize response rate and toxicities. An attempt was also made to summarize
ongoing modifications of the DCF regimen. MEDLINE, major meeting proceedings, and the government clinical trials website were searched until 2007. The
modified DCF regimens appear to improve the toxicity profile when compared
with the original DCF regimen. The docetaxel-based triplet combinations appear
to have a higher response rate than the doublet combinations. Many institutions
and cooperative groups continue to study docetaxel-based modifications of the
DCF regimen to treat patients with gastroesophageal carcinoma. However,
although modified DCF reduces the frequency of severe toxicities previously
reported with DCF, considerably more advances are needed to improve the safety,
survival, and convenience of patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer.

astric cancer is a significant health problem worldwide, with
approximately 930,000 new cases diagnosed and 700,000 deaths
attributed to the disease each year.1 In the U.S., the 5-year relative
survival rate for individuals with gastric cancer was just 24% during
the years 1996 through 2002.2 In Western countries, gastroesophageal cancer commonly remains undiagnosed until it reaches an
advanced stage. In the U.S., the stage at diagnosis is localized,
locally advanced, metastatic, and unstaged in 23%, 31%, 33%, and
12% of patients, respectively, with corresponding 5-year relative survival rates of 62%, 22%, 3%, and 13%, respectively.2 However, in
Japan, gastric cancer mass screening programs have contributed to
a situation in which patients are more commonly diagnosed with
early-stage disease and the 5-year survival rate is approximately
60%.3 Although the incidence of cardia (proximal) gastric cancer is

increasing in many Western countries, including the
U.S.,4,5 the incidence of noncardia (distal) gastric
cancer is generally declining in Western countries.
Despite this trend in the West, the incidence of noncardia gastric cancer remains high in many regions,
including Japan, China, Eastern Europe, and Central/
South America.1,5
Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for
advanced gastroesophageal cancer. A meta-analysis
of randomized, controlled trials in patients with
advanced gastric cancer (collection of information
ending in February 2005) demonstrated that chemotherapy significantly improved the median overall
survival (OS) versus best supportive care (hazards
ratio [HR] of 0.39; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 0.28-0.52). In addition, combination chemotherapy was associated with a survival benefit versus single-agent chemotherapy (HR of 0.83; 95% CI,
0.74-0.93) and combination chemotherapy regimens
containing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), anthracyclines,
and cisplatin were associated with a significant survival benefit versus 5-FU and anthracycline regimens without cisplatin (HR of 0.83; 95% CI, 0.760.91).6 Despite these findings, the treatment of
patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer
remains highly challenging and conventional treatment options remain unsatisfactory in terms of
response rate, response duration, toxicity, convenience, and OS benefit. In Europe and North America, commonly used chemotherapy regimens
include cisplatin with continuously infused 5-FU
(CF), and CF plus epirubicin (ECF). In 2006, the
combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU
(DCF) was approved for the first-line treatment of
advanced gastroesophageal cancer in many parts of
the world. This development ended a period of
20 years during which no new chemotherapy agent
or regimen gained approval for the treatment of
advanced gastroesophageal cancer, particularly in
the U.S. The objective of the current review was to
summarize the pivotal docetaxel-based trial leading
to its approval and review the currently published
and ongoing studies of modifications to the DCF
regimen. The focus was placed on reviewing the
response rate and toxicity of the modified regimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A systematic search for all published (MEDLINE
search) docetaxel-based combination studies or
ongoing trials (available at: www.clinicaltrials.gov/
accessed December 15, 2007) was performed to find
the information. All studies were collated and sum-

marized for their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, representative ongoing studies were listed.

RESULTS
The V-325 Study
To our knowledge, the activity of docetaxel in gastric
cancer was first demonstrated in phase 2 singleagent studies; reported overall response rates were
16% to 24% in the first-line setting and 5% to 21% in
previously treated patients, with approximately onethird of patients on average achieving stable disease.7-16 A phase 2 study was conducted by the Swiss
Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) and the
European Institute for Oncology (EIO) to assess the
feasibility of docetaxel in combination with cisplatin
(DC; docetaxel at a dose of 85 mg/m2 and cisplatin
at a dose of 75 mg/m2, administered every 3 weeks)
in 48 patients with unresectable and/or metastatic
gastric carcinoma who had not been treated previously for advanced disease.17 DC demonstrated reasonable activity, with an objective response rate
(ORR) of 56% (complete response rate of 4% and a
partial response rate of 52%), and a rate of stable disease of 25%. The toxicity profile was barely acceptable and manageable. Predictably for docetaxelcontaining regimens, the main toxicities were hematologic, with grade 3 of 4 (according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version
1.0]) neutropenia reported in 81% of patients and
febrile neutropenia in 17%. Other grade 3 toxicities
included anemia (32%), fatigue (9%), mucositis (9%),
and diarrhea (6%). A subsequent phase 1/2 dosefinding study demonstrated the feasibility of adding
a protracted continuous infusion of 5-FU (at a dose
of 300 mg/m2/day for 2 weeks) to DC (docetaxel at a
dose of 85 mg/m2 and cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/
m2).18 The efficacy and safety profile of the DCF triplet was comparable to that observed for DC in the
phase 2 SAKK/EIO study, with an ORR of 51%
(intent-to-treat population), and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia reported in 79% and
15% of patients, respectively. On the basis of these
results, a 3-arm, randomized, phase 2 study was conducted to compare first-line DCF, DC, and a standard
reference regimen (ECF) in 121 patients with measurable unresectable and/or metastatic gastric carcinoma.19 Docetaxel was initially administered at a
dose of 85 mg/m2 on Day 1 but after a protocol
amendment owing to toxicity after 29 patients had
been enrolled, the dose was reduced to 75 mg/m2.
The results, with a median follow-up of 27.6 months,
demonstrated ORRs of 25.0%, 18.4%, and 36.6% for
ECF, DC, and DCF, respectively, and median survival

durations of 8.3 months, 11.0 months, and 10.4
months, respectively. DC and DCF were associated
with more hematologic toxicity than ECF, with grade
3 neutropenia reported in 76%, 80%, and 59% of
patients, respectively. Corresponding rates of febrile
neutropenia were 21%, 41%, and 18%, respectively. It
is interesting to note that after the protocol amendment, the rate of febrile neutropenia was reduced
from 15% to 4% of cycles with DC and from 28% to
12% of cycles with DCF. There was 1 treatmentrelated death from septicemia in a patient receiving
DC. Global health status/quality of life, as assessed
by the European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire
(EORTC QLQ)-C30, improved with ECF and remained
stable compared with baseline for both docetaxelcontaining regimens. On the basis of these results,
the investigators recommended DCF as the superior
regimen for further evaluation, particularly in the
neoadjuvant setting, in which tumor regression is a
priority. However, the toxicity remains a concern and
requires active management.
The phase 3 V-325 study was preceded by a multinational randomized phase 2 study, which took
place at approximately the same time as the SAKK/
EIO studies. In the phase 2 V-325 study, first-line DC
(docetaxel at a dose of 85 mg/m2 on Day 1 and cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m2 on Day 1) and DCF
(docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 on Day 1, cisplatin
at a dose of 75 mg/m2 on Day 1, and 5-FU at a dose
of 750 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion on Days
1-5), both administered every 3 weeks, were compared in 158 patients with metastatic or locally
advanced or recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal
adenocarcinoma.20 Both regimens were active, with
median times-to-disease progression (TTPs) of 5.9
months and 5.0 months, respectively, and median OS
durations of 9.6 months and 10.5 months, respectively, for DCF and DC. The confirmed ORR was
markedly higher in the DCF group compared with
the DC group (43% vs 26%), prompting the independent data monitoring committee to recommend
further investigation of the DCF regimen in the
phase 3 part of the study. Overall, the toxicity profiles
of the 2 regimens were considered to be acceptable,
with a caution that active management was essential.
The most frequent grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (86% of patients in the DCF group and 87%
of patients in the DC group) and gastrointestinal toxicity (56% of patients in the DCF group vs 30% of
patients in the DC group).
The phase 3 V-325 trial was a multinational,
multicenter, open-label, randomized trial of first-line
DCF versus CF in patients with metastatic or locally

of 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m2 on
Day 1 plus 5-FU at a dose of 750 mg/m2/day as a

patients and 224 patients, respectively, receiving
treatment in each group.

tion of 32%) (Fig. 1). Median OS, the main secondary
endpoint, was 9.2 months for DCF and 8.6 months
for CF, a 23% reduction in the risk of death among
patients who received DCF (HR of 1.29; 95% CI,
1.0-1.6 [log-rank P 5 .02]) (Fig. 1). Survival benefits
were also observed for DCF versus CF in terms of
the proportion of patients alive at 1 year (40% in the
DCF group vs 32% in CF group) or at 2 years (18% in
the DCF group vs 9% in the CF group). Response
rates were found to be significantly higher in the
DCF arm, with overall confirmed response rates of
37% and 25%, respectively, for DCF versus CF
(P 5 .01) (Table 1). It is acknowledged that the difference in the median survival between the 2 arms is
not very significant; however, the 2-sided log-rank P
does not only represent the median datapoint but
the area between the 2 curves in their entirety.
Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events
occurred more frequently among patients treated with
DCF than among patients treated with CF (69% vs
59%, respectively).21 The principal differences in
safety between the 2 groups were related to hematologic events, with grade 3 neutropenia and complicated neutropenia (febrile neutropenia or neutropenic
infection) occurring more often in the DCF group
compared with the CF group (Table 2). It is interesting
to note that the incidence of complicated neutropenia
in the DCF group was reduced to 12% with the use of
secondary granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) prophylaxis compared with 27% without G-CSF.
Grade 3 diarrhea and neurosensory toxicity were also
more common in the DCF group. Importantly, the
incidence of death within 30 days of the last infusion
was comparable between the 2 groups (10% in the
DCF group vs 8% in the CF group), despite the different toxicity profiles of the 2 regimens. The safety
issues from the DCF regimen should remain a concern

if proper patient selection and continuous patient
management are not implemented.
The impact of chemotherapy on health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) is a balance between palliation
of disease-related symptoms and treatment-related
toxicity. HRQoL is an important consideration for
patients receiving palliative treatment for advanced
disease. It is necessary to be sure that the efficacy of
any noncurative chemotherapy regimen in terms of
slowing disease progression and/or prolonging survival is not counterbalanced by a reduction in patient
QoL due to treatment-related toxicity. However,
HRQoL and clinical benefit have often been overlooked as endpoints in gastric cancer clinical trials.
The V-325 study included a HRQoL analysis, with the
primary endpoint of time to 5% definitive deterioration of global health status, measured using the
EORTC QLQ-C30 form, compared with baseline.21 A
significant difference was observed in favor of DCF
versus CF (HR of 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08-1.93 [log-rank
P 5 .01]), demonstrating that the addition of docetaxel
to CF resulted in better preservation in global QoL.
The median time to the definitive deterioration of
global health status was 6.5 months for patients treated with DCF compared with 4.2 months for patients
receiving CF. Similarly, in an analysis of clinical benefit, the addition of docetaxel to CF was found to significantly prolong time to definitive worsening of

versus baseline (primary clinical benefit endpoint; HR
of 1.38; 95% CI, 1.08-1.76 [log-rank P 5 .009]). The median time to definitive worsening of KPS was found to
be 6.1 months for DCF compared with 4.8 months for
CF. The results for the majority of other secondary
HRQoL analysis, including time to definitive deterioration in social functioning, nausea/vomiting, appetite,
pain, and EuroQoL ED-5D thermometer significantly
favored the DCF regimen.22 For the secondary clinical
benefit analyses, there were nonsignificant trends in
favor of DCF in terms of the preservation of weight
and appetite; measures of pain-free survival and time
to first cancer pain-related opioid intake were comparable in each treatment arm.23
In summary, the results of the V-325 study
demonstrated the superior efficacy of DCF versus CF
as first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer.
The toxicities associated with DCF remain a concern.
However, the study results document the value of
docetaxel in the management of patients with gastroesophageal cancer and also point to the need to develop modifications for the DCF regimen.

Management of DCF-induced Complications
The effective management of docetaxel-associated
febrile neutropenia is required to ensure the safety
of chemotherapy and to prevent patients from discontinuing treatment early. Recent European and
North American guidelines recommend the routine
use of primary G-CSF prophylaxis when using
chemotherapy regimens associated with a risk of febrile neutropenia of 20%,24-26 which is within the
range associated with docetaxel-based regimens.
Indeed, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) lists DCF as an example of a chemotherapy
regimen with a high (>20%) risk of febrile neutropenia. Figure 2 summarizes the latest NCCN recommendations for prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia
after chemotherapy.26
The results of the V-325 study support the benefits of G-CSF use in conjunction with the DCF regimen; the administration of secondary prophylactic
G-CSF to patients in the DCF group reduced complicated neutropenia to the same rate as that observed
in the CF group (12%). Primary prophylactic G-CSF
should be strongly considered to reduce the risk of

950

neutropenia associated with the DCF regimen. Further support for the benefits of administering primary prophylactic G-CSF in conjunction with highrisk chemotherapy is provided by phase 3 studies in
patients with breast cancer. Significant reductions in
the incidence of hematologic toxicity-related events
including febrile neutropenia, neutropenia-associated
hospitalization, and the use of intravenous antiinfectives have been observed among patients receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy with primary prophylactic G-CSF compared with those receiving
docetaxel-based chemotherapy without primary prophylactic G-CSF.27-29 The combination of pegfilgrastim and ciprofloxacin is reported to be particularly
effective in this setting.29

Modifications of the DCF Regimen
Although DCF has become a new reference regimen
for the treatment of advanced gastroesophageal cancer, research is already underway to further improve
its tolerability. Several variations of DCF have either
been reported or are currently under investigation,
with different administration schedules, alternative
platinum and fluoropyrimidine components, and the
addition of biologic agents.
Preliminary data suggest that modification of the
standard DCF schedule may yield a regimen with an
improved safety profile, without compromising the
efficacy of the regimen. Weekly docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and 5-FU (wDCF; docetaxel at a
dose of 30 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8, cisplatin at a
dose of 60 mg/m2 on Day 1, and 5-FU at a dose of
200 mg/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 21
days, every 3 weeks) or in combination with capecitabine (wDX; the same schedule of docetaxel combined with capecitabine at a dose of 1600 mg/m2/
day on Days 1-14, every 3 weeks) has been investigated as first-line therapy in 106 patients with metastatic gastric or esophageal carcinoma (50 patients in
the wDCF group and 56 patients in the wDX
group).30 With a median follow-up of 14.6 months,
the median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS
durations were 5.9 months and 12.8 months, respectively, for wDCF and 4.2 months and 10.1 months,
respectively, for wDX. The confirmed ORR was 49%
(95% CI, 35%-63%) in the wDCF group and 26%
(95% CI, 16%-39%) in the wDX group. It is interesting
to note that grade 3 diarrhea was reported in 10%
and 7%, respectively, of patients and febrile neutropenia/neutropenic infection in 4% and 2%, respectively, of patients in the wDCF and wDX groups.
Notably, 23 of 24 patients with advanced disease
underwent secondary surgical resection and com-

plete surgical resections (R0) were achieved in 87%.
Another study by Orditura et al using docetaxel plus
capecitabine resulted in a 21% response rate and the
safety profile was determined to be acceptable.31
One may argue that combinations that do not
include a platinum compound tend to have a lower
response rate, with the understanding that response
is important for the palliation of symptoms but may
not translate into a survival advantage.
The GASTRO-TAX-1 trial was conducted to investigate a split-dose regimen of docetaxel, cisplatin,
leucovorin, and 5-FU in chemotherapy-naive patients
with nonresectable esophagogastric adenocarcinomas.32 A total of 60 patients received docetaxel and
cisplatin on Days 1, 15, and 29 and leucovorin plus
5-FU on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36, every 7 weeks.
The initial starting doses were docetaxel, 50 mg/m2;
cisplatin, 50 mg/m2; leucovorin, 500 mg/m2; and 5FU, 2000 mg/m2 as a continuous infusion over
24 hours; however, because dose reduction to <80%
of the initial dose was necessary in 80% of the first
15 patients treated, the doses were changed to docetaxel, 40 mg/m2; cisplatin, 40 mg/m2; leucovorin,
200 mg/m2; and 5-FU, 2000 mg/m2 as a continuous
infusion over 24 hours, administered using the same
schedule. Grade 3 neutropenia was reported to occur
in 23% of patients, with febrile neutropenia in 5%.
Other grade 3 adverse events included diarrhea
(20%), nausea (8%), emesis (8%), and fatigue (20%).
The ORR was 47% (95% CI, 33.3%-61.4%), and after a
median follow-up of 25.5 months, the median TTP
was 9.4 months and the median OS was 17.9 months.
Complete surgical resection was achieved in 20 of 23
patients (87%) with locally advanced disease. It is
acknowledged that one cannot make claims of high
efficacy based on these trials, but the safety profile
certainly appears to be favorable.
Activity and a favorable safety profile have been
reported for low-dose docetaxel in combination with
cisplatin and 5-FU.33 Forty-seven patients with metastatic gastric cancer who had not received prior
chemotherapy were treated with docetaxel at a dose
of 50 mg/m2 and cisplatin at a dose of 80 mg/m2 on
Day 1, and 5-FU at a dose of 1200 mg/m2 per day on
Days 1 through 3, every 3 weeks, for a median of 4
cycles. A partial response was observed in 17 of 42
evaluable patients (40%; 95% CI, 26%-55%); the median TTP was 4.6 months and the median OS duration was 9.7 months. The most common grade 3
nonhematologic toxicities were stomatitis (21%) and
syncope (6%); other grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities occurred in <5% of patients. Grade 3 neutropenia was reported in 68% of patients, with febrile
neutropenia/neutropenic infection reported in 26%.

Evolution of DCF in Gastric Cancer/Ajani

Substitution of Cisplatin with Oxaliplatin
The diaminocyclohexane platinum compound oxaliplatin has demonstrated in vitro activity in human
gastric cancer cell lines.34,35 Similar to cisplatin, oxaliplatin forms platinum–DNA adducts, which inhibit
DNA synthesis and repair.36 However, oxaliplatin has
a wider spectrum of antitumor activity than cisplatin37 and is active in cell lines with acquired cisplatin
resistance as well as in tumor types with intrinsic cisplatin resistance.38 Oxaliplatin and cisplatin also differ
in terms of toxicity profile. Oxaliplatin is commonly
associated with sensory neuropathy, comprised of
transient, acute cold-related sensory neuropathy and
cumulative, chronic, dose-limiting sensory neuropathy that generally resolve over time.39 Cisplatin is
associated with dose-limiting nephrotoxicity; peripheral neuropathy; and dose-dependent, irreversible,
ototoxicity.34 Therefore, although oxaliplatin is a reasonable alternative platinum agent, cumulative neuropathy remains a concern.
The REAL-2 study (analog substitutions to reduce toxicity)
The randomized ECF for advanced and locally
advanced gastroesophageal cancer 2 (REAL-2) study
investigated the potential for substituting oxaliplatin
for cisplatin and oral capecitabine for intravenous
(iv) 5-FU in the conventional ECF regimen.40 The
study had a 2-by-2 factorial design and patients were
randomized to receive ECF; the combination of epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (ECX); the combination of epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and /5-FU (EOF); or
the combination of epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine (EOX). For each regimen, doses were epirubicin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, cisplatin
at a dose of 60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, oxaliplatin at a
dose of 130 mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks, 5-FU at a dose
of 200 mg/m2 iv as continuous infusion daily, and
capecitabine at a dose of 625 mg/m2 orally twice
daily, every day, for 8 cycles. The primary endpoint
was OS and the study was powered to demonstrate
the noninferiority of capecitabine over 5-FU and of
oxaliplatin over cisplatin. A total of 1002 patients
were randomized and, after a median follow-up duration of 17.1 months, the primary endpoint had
been met for both the fluoropyrimidine and platinum comparisons.39 The median OS was 10.9
months for patients who received capecitabine (ECX
or EOX) compared with 9.6 months for patients who
received 5-FU (ECF or EOF) (HR of 0.86; 95% CI,
0.75-0.99), and was 10.4 months for patients who
received oxaliplatin (EOX or EOF) compared with
10.1 months for patients who received cisplatin (ECF
or ECX) (HR of 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80-1.05).40 The inci-

951

dences of grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities were
36%, 42%, 33%, and 45%, respectively in the ECF,
ECX, EOF, and EOX arms, and grade 3 neutropenia
was significantly less common in the 2 oxaliplatincontaining treatment arms compared with the comparator arm (42% in ECF and 30% in EOF [P 5 .008];
51% in ECX [P 5 .043]; and 28% in EOX [P 5 .001]).
These data demonstrate that the fluoropyrimidine and platinum components of ECF may be
substituted with capecitabine and oxaliplatin, respectively, with no decrease in efficacy noted.

The combination of docetaxel and oxaliplatin
There is a rationale for combining docetaxel and oxaliplatin based on the activity of both agents in gastric
cancer and in combination with infusional 5-FU, and
their distinct and complementary mechanisms of
action, lack of cross-resistance, and different toxicity
profiles. The combination of docetaxel and oxaliplatin has been investigated in several recent phase 2
studies.40-45 A study by the U.S. Oncology Group
assessed first-line treatment with docetaxel and oxaliplatin (docetaxel at a dose of 60 mg/m2 iv over
1 hour on Day 1 followed by oxaliplatin at a dose of
130 mg/m2 iv over 2 hours on Day 1, every 3 weeks)
in 71 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
stomach and/or gastroesophageal junction.41 The
combination of docetaxel and oxaliplatin achieved
an ORR of 36% and responses lasted a median duration of 5.6 months. The median OS and PFS durations were 8.5 months and 4.3 months, respectively.
The most common nonhematologic adverse events
were vomiting (17%), nausea (16%), dehydration
(13%), diarrhea (13%), and fatigue (13%). Grade 3
neutropenia was reported in 70% of patients, with
febrile neutropenia reported in 7% and thrombocytopenia in 7%. The combination of docetaxel and oxaliplatin has also demonstrated activity in patients with
advanced gastric cancer who have developed disease
progression while receiving 5-FU-based therapy. In a
study of 38 patients, docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2
on Day 1 and oxaliplatin at a dose of 80 mg/m2 on
Day 2, every 3 weeks, achieved an ORR of 10.5% and
a stable disease rate of 47.3%. The median TTP was
4.0 months and the median OS was 8.1 months.
Grade 3 toxicities were neutropenia (26.3%), asthenia
(15.7%), nausea/vomiting (15.7%), and neurotoxicity
(2.6%). There were no cases of febrile neutropenia
reported and no other grade 3 hematologic toxicities.42 In another phase 2 study, doublet therapy with
docetaxel at a dose of 80 mg/m2 plus oxaliplatin at a
dose of 100 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 3 weeks, with GCSF at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day on Days 2 through 6,

was investigated in 36 patients with metastatic or
locally advanced esophagogastric cancer.43 A confirmed response was reported in 13 of 36 patients
(36%), with a median TTP of 5.6 months and a median OS duration of 9.8 months. The main toxicity
was hematologic and grade 3 neutropenia and anemia each occurred in 16.6% of patients.
A small study (16 patients) has assessed the
combination of docetaxel (50 mg/m2 over 1 hour)
with modified FOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin at a dose of
85 mg/m2 iv over 2 hours plus 5-FU at a dose of
400 mg/m2 bolus and 3000 mg/m2 iv over 48 hours
plus leucovorin at a dose of 400 mg/m2 iv over
2 hours) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. This regimen was well tolerated
and achieved an ORR of 44%, including 1 complete
and 6 partial responses.44 Docetaxel in combination
with modified FOLFOX (docetaxel at a dose of
50 mg/m2 on Day 1 plus oxaliplatin at a dose of 85
mg/m2 in combination with leucovorin at a dose of
200 mg/m2 plus 5-FU at a dose of 2600 mg/m2 iv
over 24 hours, every 2 weeks [FLOT regimen])
achieved an ORR of 51% in a study of 59 patients
with untreated locally advanced or metastatic cancer
of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.45 The
median PFS was 5.3 months, the median OS was
11.3 months, and the 6-month survival rate was 75%.
The main grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia
(46.3%), leukopenia (22.2%), and diarrhea (14.8%).
Febrile neutropenia was reported in 3.7% of patients.
Preliminary results have also been reported for an
ongoing phase 1/2 study of docetaxel in combination
with 5-FU and oxaliplatin (d-FOX regimen).46 A total
of 41 patients with untreated advanced gastric or
gastroesophageal cancer have been enrolled to
receive docetaxel (at a starting dose of 20 mg/m2
with dose escalation in 2.5-mg/m2 increments to
find the maximum tolerated dose [MTD]) plus oxaliplatin at a dose of 85 mg/m2 and 5-FU at a dose of
2200 mg/m2 iv over 48 hours on Day 1 for the first 2
weeks of a 4-week cycle. The MTD for docetaxel had
not been reached after 4 weeks of treatment (the
dose level was 50 mg/m2 at the time of last followup). The d-FOX regimen was found to be well tolerated, with no neutropenic infection or febrile neutropenia reported during the first cycle; the most
common grade 3 toxicities were neutropenia (7.3%)
and anemia (26.8%).46
The combination of docetaxel at a dose of
60 mg/m2 and irinotecan at a dose of 150 mg/m2 on
Day 1, plus oxaliplatin at a dose of 85 mg/m2 on Day
2, has been evaluated in a phase 2 study in patients
with metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction
cancer.47 A response rate of 50% was observed in 40

patients, with a median OS of 11.5 months. The most
notable toxicity was grade 3 neutropenia, which
occurred in 48% of patients and 3 patients had 4 episodes of febrile neutropenia. To further investigate
the utility of the docetaxel and oxaliplatin combination, the randomized phase 2 GATE study has been
initiated to investigate 3 docetaxel and oxaliplatin
regimens in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Approximately
270 patients who have not received prior palliative
chemotherapy will be randomized to treatment with
docetaxel and oxaliplatin; docetaxel, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-FU; or docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and
capecitabine. The primary endpoint is TTP and secondary endpoints include toxicity, ORR, and OS.48,49
A multicenter, nonrandomized phase 2 study is also
currently ongoing to assess the combination of docetaxel and oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab in patients
with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic
gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer. The target accrual is 38 patients and the primary study endpoint is TTP.50
There is also potential for the docetaxel and oxaliplatin combination in the neoadjuvant setting. In a
planned, nonrandomized, phase 2 EORTC study,
patients with locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma will receive
preoperative treatment with docetaxel, oxaliplatin,
and 5-FU followed by concomitant oxaliplatin and 5FU plus radiotherapy and then surgery.51 Another
ongoing, nonrandomized phase 2 study will assess
the feasibility of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy with docetaxel and oxaliplatin, floxuridine
(an analog of 5-FU), and leucovorin in patients with
previously untreated, resectable esophageal cancer.
The target accrual is 34 patients and the primary
study endpoint is the pathologic complete response
rate.52
Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-FU that can
potentially increase the convenience of chemotherapy by eliminating the need for lengthy iv 5-FU
infusion. As described earlier, the REAL-2 study demonstrated the noninferiority of substituting capecitabine for 5-FU in the ECF regimen.40 Small phase 2
studies have also demonstrated the feasibility of
administering capecitabine in combination with docetaxel, with response rates ranging from 39% to 55%
(with occasional exceptions)30,31 and an acceptable
toxicity profile comprising, primarily, neutropenia,
febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, stomatitis, and
hand–foot syndrome.30,53-57 Evans et al have further
modified the DCF regimen by substituting cisplatin
with carboplatin to reduce neurotoxicity, while
increasing the convenience of the regimen by substi-

Evolution of DCF in Gastric Cancer/Ajani

tuting capecitabine for 5-FU.58 The docetaxel, carboplatin, and capecitabine regimen was found to be
well tolerated in this phase 2 study, with grade 3
neutropenia and grade 3 diarrhea, nausea/vomiting,
and dehydration being the most notable toxicities.
Responses were observed in 48% of patients, with
complete responses noted in 3 patients; the median
OS was 8 months (95% CI, 5.5 months-13 months)
and the 1-year survival rate was 36%.

S-1
S-1 is a rationally designed oral fluoropyrimidine.
This novel agent consists of the 5-FU prodrug tegafur
combined with 2 enzyme inhibitors: a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase inhibitor, which increases
plasma concentrations of 5-FU and may decrease
toxicity (hand–foot syndrome, neurotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity) by reducing catabolites that are implicated, and an orotate phosphoribosyl transferase
inhibitor, which decreases the conversion of 5-FU to
fluoropyrimidine monophosphate, which is known to
promote diarrhea and therefore may decrease the
frequency and/or severity of diarrhea. S-1 has been
available for the treatment of gastric cancer in Japan
since 1999, having demonstrated high response rates
and a favorable toxicity profile.59,60
Several international phase 3 studies are currently ongoing to investigate S-1 as monotherapy
and in combination with other agents. The combination of docetaxel and S-1 (docetaxel at a dose of
40 mg/m2 iv on Day 1 and S-1 at a dose of 80 mg/
m2/day on Days 1-14, every 3 weeks) was investigated in a phase 2 study of 48 patients with
advanced or recurrent gastric adenocarcinoma who
had received up to 1 previous chemotherapy regimen. The ORR was 56% (all partial responses) and
38% of patients had achieved stable disease. The median OS was 14.3 months and the median TTP was
7.3 months.61 The combination of docetaxel and S-1
was found to be well tolerated; the most common
grade 3 toxicities were neutropenia (58%), leukopenia
(42%), anorexia (15%), febrile neutropenia (8%), anemia (8%), stomatitis (8%), and nausea (6%) and no
grade 4 nonhematologic toxicities were reported.60
The S-1 plus taxotere versus S-1 alone in advanced
gastric cancer randomized trial (START) is a large
phase 3 trial that was recently initiated in Japan and
Korea and will compare the combination of docetaxel and S-1 with S-1 alone in patients with inoperable or recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal
cancer.50 A total of 628 patients are projected to be
enrolled in this trial, which will examine OS as the
primary endpoint. However, to our knowledge, the
efficacy of S-1 in patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer has yet to be established.

Biologic Agents and Docetaxel-based Therapy
Several phase 2 trials are currently underway to
investigate various regimens of docetaxel in combination with biologic agents, including docetaxel and
bevacizumab; docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab; docetaxel, cisplatin, and sorafenib; docetaxel
plus oxaliplatin and cetuximab; and docetaxel and
imatinib. Results from a small study of docetaxel
plus bevacizumab have been presented.62 A total of
20 patients with advanced gastric or esophageal cancer received docetaxel at a dose of 35 mg/m2 on
Days 1, 8, and 15 plus bevacizumab at a dose of
5 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15, every 4 weeks. Interim
response data for 15 patients demonstrated a partial
response in 4 patients (27%) and stable disease in
another 5 patients (33%). Grade 3 adverse events
included anemia (15%), fatigue (15%), neutropenia
(10%), gastrointestinal bleeding (15%), and arterial
thrombosis (10%), with the latter 2 events likely to
be related to bevacizumab.

DISCUSSION
The DCF regimen has become a new chemotherapeutic treatment option for patients with advanced
gastric and gastroesophageal cancer, supported by
the results of the V-325 trial. The addition of docetaxel to the CF combination achieved significant
improvements in TTP, OS, 1-year and 2-year survival,
and ORR. QoL and clinical benefit were found to be
favorable for DCF and were not compromised by the
higher toxicity that accompanies the more active triplet regimen. Secondary prophylactic G-CSF reduced
the incidence of complicated neutropenia in the
DCF treatment arm to the same rate as that observed
in the CF treatment arm; this observation is consistent with recent guidelines that recommend that
patients should receive primary G-CSF prophylaxis in
conjunction with chemotherapy regimens that are
associated with a high risk of febrile neutropenia.
However, DCF is associated with substantial toxicity.
Ongoing research suggests that further improvement
of the safety of the DCF regimen may be achieved by
altering the treatment schedule, substituting cisplatin
with oxaliplatin, and substituting a continuous infusion of 5-FU with an orally administered fluoropyrimidine. These modest improvements experienced by
our patients are clearly not sufficient and we need to
continue to strive to improve the efficacy, safety, and
convenience of the treatment. The role of biologic
agents in gastroesophageal cancer therapy remains
to be defined but will be a logical next step for investigation. Finally, an active and safe combination
regimen might produce dramatic benefit in the preoperative setting and should be investigated further.
