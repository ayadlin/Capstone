Physical Association of HDAC1 and HDAC2 with p63
Mediates Transcriptional Repression and Tumor
Maintenance in Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Matthew R. Ramsey, Lei He, Nicole Forster, Benjamin Ory, and Leif W. Ellisen

Abstract
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a treatment-refractory subtype of human cancer arising from stratified
epithelium of the skin, lung, esophagus, oropharynx, and other tissues. A unifying feature of SCC is high-level
expression of the p53-related protein p63 (TP63) in 80% of cases. The major protein isoform of p63 expressed in
SCC is DNp63a, an N-terminally truncated form which functions as a key SCC cell survival factor by mechanisms
that are unclear. In this study, we show that DNp63a associates with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2
to form an active transcriptional repressor complex that can be targeted to therapeutic advantage. Repression of
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member genes including p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) by p63/
HDAC is required for survival of SCC cells. Cisplatin chemotherapy, a mainstay of SCC treatment, promotes
dissociation of p63 and HDAC from the PUMA promoter, leading to increased histone acetylation, PUMA
activation, and apoptosis. These effects are recapitulated upon targeting the p63/HDAC complex selectively with
class I/II HDAC inhibitors using both in vitro and in vivo models. Sensitivity to HDAC inhibition is directly
correlated with p63 expression and is abrogated in tumor cells that overexpress endogenous Bcl-2. Together, our
results elucidate a mechanism of p63-mediated transcriptional repression and they identify the DNp63a/HDAC
complex as an essential tumor maintenance factor in SCC. In addition, our findings offer a rationale to apply
HDAC inhibitors for SCC treatment. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4373–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Understanding the biochemical basis for tumor maintenance is critical to the rational application of targeted therapeutic agents. In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the p53
family member p63 is a key survival factor whose inhibition by
RNA interference induces apoptosis, and whose degradation by
cisplatin-based chemotherapy is thought to be important for
the therapeutic response to this agent (1–4). The p63 gene is
expressed through two promoters as two distinct isoform
classes which either contain (TAp63) or lack (DNp63) an Nterminal transactivation domain. Additional isoform heterogeneity is generated through alternative C-terminal splicing
(5). Consistently, the major p63 isoform overexpressed in SCC
is DNp63a, a protein which has been shown to function as a
positive and negative transcriptional regulator of different
target gene subsets (5, 6).

Given its potential therapeutic relevance, precisely how
DNp63a mediates tumor-cell survival is under intensive investigation. We previously showed that DNp63a functions in part
by binding and suppressing the proapoptotic activity of the
related p53 family member p73 (1, 7). Whether binding to p73 is
sufficient for tumor-cell survival in this setting is unresolved. In
addition, we and others have observed localization of p63 to the
promoters of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members including p53
upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), raising the possibility that DNp63a functions as an active transcriptional
repressor (1, 8). Here, we use biochemical approaches to
identify an endogenous repressor complex involving DNp63a,
histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and HDAC2, and we show the
potential relevance of p63/HDAC-mediated transcriptional
repression in the response to cisplatin chemotherapy and
HDAC inhibitor therapy in SCC.

Results and Discussion
Lentiviral and retroviral production, luciferase assays,
and mRNA quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR
Production of virus, luciferase assays, and mRNA analysis
were carried out as described (1). Primers used for QRT-PCR
are shown in Supplementary Table S1.
Preparation of nuclear extracts and glycerol density
gradient fractionation
Nuclear extracts were prepared by suspending cells in hypotonic buffer (10mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10
mmol/L KCl) for 20 minutes, followed by douncing. Pelleted
nuclei were suspended in 1 volume 20 mmol/L KCl nuclear buffer
(20 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/L
EDTA, 25% glycerol). One volume 1.2 mol/L KCl nuclear buffer
was added dropwise then incubated for 30 minutes at 4 C with
rotation. Cleared supernatant was dialyzed against BC-100
buffer (100 mmol/L KCl, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.2
mmol/L EDTA, 20% glycerol). Glycerol density gradient fractionation was carried out as previously described (12).
Tandem affinity purification
Cells were stably infected with pMSCV-DNp63a- FLAG-HA
(C-terminal) or pMSCV-GFP-FLAG-HA plasmids, and cleared
lysates from nuclear extracts were incubated for 4 hours with
a-FLAG conjugated beads. Beads were washed with 100
mmol/L, 250 mmol/L, 500 mmol/L, 250 mmol/L, and 100
mmol/L KCl wash buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mmol/
L MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 10% glycerol).
Immune complexes were eluted with 0.5mg/mL FLAG peptide
in 150 mmol/L KCl wash buffer. Eluate was incubated 12 hours
at 4 C with a-HA conjugated beads. Beads were washed with
100 mmol/L, 200 mmol/L, 250 mmol/L, 200 mmol/L, and 100
mmol/L KCl wash buffer and boiled in Laemmli buffer.
Proteins were visualized using the SilverQuest Silver Staining
Kit (Invitrogen).
Immunoprecipitation and chromatin
immunoprecipitation
Cleared nuclear lysates were incubated with antibody and
protein A beads for 3 hours at 4 C, and immunocomplexes
were washed with 100 mmol/L, 250 mmol/L, 400 mmol/L, 250
mmol/L, 100 mmol/L KCl wash buffer. For transient transfections, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA-DNp63a–FLAG
(C-terminal) mutants and pcDNA3-HDAC1. Forty hours posttransfection, cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated
in hypotonic buffer for 20 minutes at 4 C. Following sonication, 3 mol/L KCl was added dropwise to a final concentration
of 150 mmol/L and proteins were immunoprecipitated as
above. ChIP was carried out as previously described (13) with
modifications detailed in Supplementary Methods.

Interaction between endogenous p63 and HDAC1/2
In order to uncover the biochemical basis for p63-dependent transcriptional regulation, we isolated p63-associated
nuclear proteins from JHU-029, a human squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC)-derived cell line in which endogenous p63
functions as an essential suppressor of apoptosis (1, 7). Using
tandem affinity purification (TAP), we purified complexes
from nuclear extracts of cells expressing either DNp63aFLAG/HA or control nuclear GFP-FLAG/HA. Expected p63associated proteins, including endogenous p63 and p73, were
identified on silver-stained gels and subsequently confirmed
by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1A) (1, 14). The next most abundant silver-stained band, observed consistently following
DNp63a but not green fluorescent protein (GFP) purification,
contained HDAC1 and HDAC2 proteins (Fig. 1A). To confirm
the specificity of their interactions with p63, we conducted
western analysis for HDAC1 and HDAC2 following TAP for
tagged DNp63a or nuclear GFP control. Consistent with our
mass spectrometry findings, endogenous HDAC1 and HDAC2
specifically interacted with DNp63a but not with nuclear GFP
(Fig. 1A).
Using glycerol density gradient fractionation, we observed
cofractionation of endogenous DNp63a, HDAC1, and HDAC2
in complexes greater than 440 kDa, potentially suggesting the
presence of a complex involving these three proteins (Fig. 1B).
To confirm the endogenous association we carried out reciprocal coimmunoprecipitations for p63, HDAC1, and HDAC2
in JHU-029 cells (Fig. 1C) and a second head and neck SCC
(HNSCC) line, FaDU (Supplementary Fig. S1A), and observed a
specific interaction between these three proteins. Finally, in
order to examine these interactions in more detail we mapped
the domain of p63 required for HDAC association. We transfected a series of FLAG-tagged p63 deletion mutants (Supplementary Fig. S1B) together with HDAC1 into 293T cells, and
carried out immunoprecipitations using either a-FLAG
(Fig. 1D) or a-HDAC1 (Supplementary Fig. S1C) antibodies.
Remarkably, only the transactivation inhibitory domain (TID)
of DNp63a was required for HDAC binding, whereas the sterile
alpha motif (SAM) domain, a putative protein interaction
domain, was entirely dispensable (5). Given the well-established association between HDAC1 and HDAC2 (15), our
findings collectively suggest that DNp63a, HDAC1 and HDAC2
exist in a trimeric complex in SCC cells.
Requirement for p63 promoter association in
p63-mediated repression
We hypothesized that p63 mediates direct transcriptional
repression in SCC cells through recruitment of HDACs to the
promoters of proapoptotic genes including PUMA. This
hypothesis requires that p63 and HDACs are localized to this
promoter, and that promoter binding by p63 is essential for its
ability to repress transcription. We therefore carried out
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for p63 and HDAC1

HDAC1 was also observed within the regulatory regions of
other p63-repressed genes (Supplementary Fig. S2A). To
address the functional contribution of promoter binding by
DNp63a we first used a PUMA promoter reporter assay (1). We
co-expressed either wild-type DNp63a (WT) or a naturallyoccurring DNA binding-deficient point mutant, DNp63a
(R304W) (5), together with TAp73b or p53 and examined
luciferase activity. Wild-type DNp63a was a potent suppressor
of both p73 and p53-dependent PUMA reporter activation,
while the non-DNA binding mutant DNp63a (R304W) was
defective in suppressing activation (Fig. 2B). Of note, the p63
mutant was expressed at similar levels as the wild-type

(Fig. 2B) and exhibits comparable binding to p73 (Supplementary Fig. S2B) but not to p53 (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Because transient reporter assays lack chromatin context,
we next tested whether suppression of endogenous PUMA
transcription required DNA-bound p63. We expressed retroviral FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant DNp63a (R304W) in
SCC cells, then carried out ChIP using an anti-FLAG antibody.
As expected, wild-type DNp63a showed significant binding to
the PUMA promoter, whereas the mutant showed little or no
binding over background (Fig. 2C). As a functional test we then
ablated expression of endogenous p63 in these cells, having
engineered the ectopic DNp63a constructs to contain silent
point mutants, which made them resistant to the lentiviral
shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Ectopic wild-type DNp63a

nearly completely suppressed PUMA induction following
endogenous p63 knockdown, whereas mutant DNp63a-expressing cells showed dramatic PUMA induction (Fig. 2D and
Supplementary Fig. S2E) and cell death (Supplementary
Fig. S2F) in this setting. Taken together, these data show the
requirement for promoter-bound p63 in suppression of endogenous PUMA transcription and cell death in SCC cells.
HDAC and p63-dependent regulation of PUMA and
chemotherapy response in squamous cell carcinoma
cells
Having documented the presence of endogenous HDAC1
and p63 at the PUMA promoter (Fig. 2A) we wished to test the
biochemical requirement for HDAC activity in PUMA regulation. Treatment with the potent class I/II HDAC inhibitor
trichostatin A (TSA) caused a dose-dependent induction of
PUMA mRNA in three different SCC cell lines (Fig. 3A). A

similar dose-dependent induction of PUMA was observed
following treatment with vorinostat (SAHA), a second generation inhibitor which is currently Food and Drug Administration–approved for treatment of cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma (CTCL) (Supplementary Fig. S3A) (16). PUMA
mRNA induction by TSA corresponded temporally with
increased histone H4 acetylation at the p63 binding site within
the PUMA promoter (Fig. 3B and S3B), consistent with a direct
effect of the inhibitor at this promoter. In order to show
directly a connection between the presence of p63 and HDAC
activity at the PUMA promoter we assayed histone acetylation
following p63 knockdown in SCC cells. Indeed, histone H4
acetylation was significantly induced following ablation of
p63, concurrent with endogenous PUMA upregulation
(Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3C). Thus, HDAC activity
controls PUMA expression in SCC cells in a p63-dependent
manner.

Cisplatin-based chemotherapy, a mainstay for treatment of
advanced HNSCC, promotes degradation of DNp63a and
induction of PUMA, which have been linked to the therapeutic
response in this disease (3, 4). We found that disruption of the
p63/HDAC complex contributes to the response to cisplatin,
as PUMA expression induced by cisplatin (Supplementary
Figs. S3D and S3E) was accompanied by a loss of endogenous
p63 and HDAC1 at the PUMA promoter, and by an increase in
histone acetylation (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S3D).
Thus p63/HDAC-mediated PUMA transcriptional repression
is mitigated in the physiological response to cisplatin chemotherapy.
Targeting p63/HDAC-dependent transcriptional
repression in squamous cell carcinoma
We have shown previously that some SCC cell lines are able
to bypass the requirement for DNp63a as a survival factor
through overexpression of endogenous Bcl-2 itself (1, 17).
Consistent with this observation, we found that SCC lines
which exhibit low expression of DNp63a showed high-level
expression of Bcl-2, and vice-versa [Fig. 4A and reference (1)].
We therefore hypothesized that lines with high DNp63a
expression are "addicted" to DNp63a/HDAC function and
therefore would be sensitive to HDAC inhibition, whereas
lines with low DNp63a would exhibit HDAC inhibitor resistance. Indeed, we observed a direct correlation between

www.aacrjournals.org

DNp63a protein levels and sensitivity to TSA in SCC cells
(Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4A). In addition, we found
that ectopic Bcl-2 expression was sufficient to confer remarkable in vitro TSA resistance in the TSA-sensitive line JHU-029
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). Thus, although multiple pathways
may contribute to effects of HDAC inhibition in SCC cells (18),
these data support a prominent role for the p63-dependent
pathway we describe here.
Finally, we sought to model HDAC inhibition for treatment
of SCC in vivo and to determine the contribution of Bcl-2
expression in this setting. Notably, we recently showed that
Bcl-2 expression in primary HNSCC is an intrinsic resistance
factor and a powerful predictor of relapse following cisplatinbased therapy (17). We established a xenograft assay using
JHU-029 cells, which form tumors in 100% of Nude mice when
injected subcutaneously. Mice bearing palpable tumors,
derived from JHU-029 cells expressing either a retroviral
control (GFP) or Bcl-2 vector, were treated by IP injection
with vorinostat or vehicle control. Vorinostat treatment substantially and consistently blocked tumor progression in mice
with GFP-expressing tumors (Fig. 4C). Remarkably, however,
expression of Bcl-2 induced complete resistance to vorinostat
treatment (Fig. 4C). To determine the physiological basis for
the response to HDAC inhibition in vivo we assayed markers of
proliferation and apoptosis in these tumors. We observed no
difference in proliferation following vorinostat treatment in

activity blocks SCC progression.
A, inverse correlation between
DNp63a and Bcl-2 levels in the
indicated SCC lines, assessed by
western blotting. Glyceraldehyde
3 phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) serves as a loading
control. B, direct correlation
between endogenous DNp63a
protein levels, assessed by
densitometry, and sensitivity to
TSA in SCC cells, assessed by
8-point standard curve at 3 days
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). All
values are relative to FaDU cells.
C, vorinostat blocks tumor
progression in SCC in vivo, but
Bcl-2 induces complete
resistance. JHU-029/GFP (left) or
JHU-029/Bcl-2 (right) xenografts
in Nude mice were treated either
with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
vehicle (n ¼ 22, 22) or 50 mg/kg
vorinostat (n ¼ 22, 16) daily by IP
injection starting at day 9.

in vivo. Left, lysates from the
indicated xenograft tumors were
examined for cleaved PARP1.
Right, cleaved caspase
3 was detected by
immunohistochemistry in sections

any tumors, as assessed by Ki67 staining (Supplementary Figs.
S4C,D). In contrast, control vorinostat-treated tumors showed
substantial cleaved PARP-1 (Fig. 4D) and activated Caspase 3
(Fig. 4D), which were completely absent in Bcl-2-expressing
tumors. All together, our findings show the presence of a
functional p63/HDAC complex which serves as a direct
repressor of the apoptotic transcriptional program in SCC.
HDAC inhibitors target this complex to induce tumor cell
killing through upregulation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members, whereas sensitivity to these drugs can be abrogated
in tumor cells that overexpress Bcl-2.
These findings reveal a tumor-specific context for HDAC
function in SCC, which will inform the rational and effective
application of these agents. For example, a recent clinical trial
of late-stage, chemotherapy-refractory HNSCC patients trea-

ted with vorinostat did not show clinical responses (19). This
finding is consistent with our data showing that a common
transcriptional and apoptotic response pathway involving p63
and HDAC1/2 seems to participate in the response to both
cisplatin and HDAC inhibitors. Conceivably, treating patients
earlier in the course of disease may improve the efficacy of
HDAC inhibition in SCC. Our study also provides insight into a
specific resistance mechanism, suggesting that HDAC inhibitors may not be useful as single agents in Bcl-2 positive SCCs.
An attractive approach for these tumors might instead include
Bcl-2 inhibitors, which are currently in clinical trials, either
alone or in combination with HDAC inhibitors (20). If successful, such a stratified and targeted approach based on an
understanding of tumor-selective biology would represent a
significant advance against this disease.
