BACKGROUND. Death receptors mediate both apoptosis and survival in cancer cells.
The authors analyzed death receptor expression in metastatic ovarian carcinoma.

METHODS. Viable tumor cells in ovarian carcinoma effusions (n 5 95) were analyzed for DR4, DR5, Fas, TNFR1, and TNFR2 expression using flow cytometry.
Results were analyzed for association with clinicopathologic parameters, chemotherapy response, and survival.

RESULTS. DR4, DR5, and Fas were expressed by the majority of specimens, with
less frequent expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2. DR4 (P 5 .005) and TNFR2 (P 5
.041) expression was higher in FIGO stage IV compared with stage III tumors.

CONCLUSIONS. The authors have presented the first evidence of death receptor coexpression in ovarian carcinoma effusions. The association of death receptor expression
in effusions with advanced stage, poor response to chemotherapy, and shorter survival suggests that these molecules are linked to an aggressive clinical course in metastatic ovarian carcinoma. Cancer 2008;112:84–93.  2007 American Cancer Society.

eath receptors (DRs) are members of the tumor necrosis factor
receptor (TNFR) superfamily and are able to induce the extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway upon ligand binding.
In addition to exhibiting the cysteine-rich extracellular domain
typical of the TNFR family, DRs are characterized by a conserved
cytoplasmic domain of approximately 80 amino acids, the death
domain (DD), which is essential for transduction of the apoptotic
signal. The mechanism of signal transduction is best described for
Fas (CD95/Apo-1), TNFR1, TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand
receptor-1(TRAIL-R1/DR4), and TRAIL-R2 (DR5). Their respective
ligands include FasL (CD95L/Apo-1L), TNF and TRAIL which binds
to both DR4 and DR5. Two decoy receptors, TRAIL-R3 (DcR1) and
TRAIL-R4 (DcR2), bind to TRAIL but do not transmit the apoptotic
signal.1,2
Upon activation, Fas, DR4, and DR5 form the death-inducing
signaling complex (DISC) by recruiting through their DDs the adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD). Pro-caspase-8

or -10 is recruited into the DISC by FADD, where it is
activated by cleavage. This triggers the executioners
caspase-3, -6, and -7 and apoptosis. Similarly, TNFR1
interacts with TNFR-associated death domain
(TRADD). TRADD interacts with FADD to engage
pro-caspase-8 or -10, thereby initiating apoptosis.1–3
TNFR2 lacks a DD, yet induces apoptosis indirectly
by activating TNFR1.2
DR-induced caspase-8 activation can also lead to
BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID) cleavage
and to its subsequent translocation into the mitochondria, where it mediates cytochrome c release. Thus,
the death signal originated by DRs can be amplified
by employing the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.1,3
Irradiation and the majority of conventional cytotoxic agents induce cell death through indirect
activation of the p53-dependent intrinsic apoptotic
pathway. Frequently, though, cancer cells acquire resistance to treatment through p53 inactivation.4
Triggering DRs to induce cancer cell apoptosis,
thereby circumventing the need for intact p53 signaling, is an appealing therapeutic strategy. Recombinant TRAIL or agonist antibodies that target DR4
and DR5 are undergoing clinical trials,5,6 whereas
TNF-a is already used in an isolated limb perfusion
setting for the treatment of locally advanced sarcoma, metastatic melanoma, and other unresectable
tumors. Systemic use of TNF-a is limited by its high
toxicity, related to its proinflammatory activity.1,7
Exploiting DR activation for cancer treatment
requires diligence, as growing evidence suggests that
Fas, DR4, and DR5 have nonapoptotic functions as
well, including promoting cell survival and proliferation,8–11 inducing inflammatory response,12,13 and
mediating tumorigenesis and tumor progression.14–16
These functions may involve NF-jB,12,15,17 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK),8–11,15 and Akt10,11
signaling. The ability of TNFR1 to induce apoptosis
is considered secondary to its role in regulating
inflammatory processes. The latter involves NF-jB
and JNK/AP-1 activation through the recruitment of
the secondary adaptor proteins, TNFR-associated
factor-2 (TRAF2) and receptor interacting protein
(RIP), by TRADD.18
Ovarian carcinoma (OC) frequently metastasizes
to the peritoneal and pleural cavities, with ascites
being present in 65% of patients at diagnosis.19 Effusions are, in addition, a frequent site of disease
recurrence. Whereas primary tumors are amenable to
surgical removal, effusions cannot be eradicated without chemotherapy. Metastatic OC, especially upon recurrence, is associated with primary or acquired
resistance to chemotherapy.20 Studies of effusions
and corresponding solid tumors have demonstrated

85

that cells in effusions differ in phenotype and genotype from their counterparts in solid lesions.19 These
factors underscore the need to study molecules
related to inhibition of apoptosis, cell survival, and
drug resistance that may have a role in the biology
of cancer cells in effusions.
We studied the expression of Fas, DR4, DR5,
TNFR1, and TNFR2 in OC effusions by using flow
cytometry. We further analyzed the association between DR expression levels, chemotherapy response,
and patient outcome. Expression of these receptors
was, in addition, studied in a small series of breast
carcinoma effusions as a comparative biological
model for gynecologic adenocarcinomas that affect
the serosal cavities. We present the first evidence of
death receptor coexpression in metastatic OC in effusions and demonstrate that their presence is associated with advanced stage, poor response to
chemotherapy, and shorter survival. We also show
that death receptors are expressed in breast carcinoma effusions, although Fas expression is significantly lower in breast carcinoma compared with OC
cells in effusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Material
Ninety-five fresh, nonfixed effusions (80 peritoneal,
15 pleural) were analyzed. Specimens were obtained
from 77 patients (65 patients with 1 effusion, 9 with 2
effusions, 2 with 3 effusions, and 1 with 6 effusions)
diagnosed with OC (n 5 63), primary peritoneal serous carcinoma (n 5 8), or tubal serous carcinoma (5
6). Because of their similar histogenesis, morphology,
and treatment, all are referred to as OC henceforth.
OC specimens and relevant clinical data were
obtained from the Department of Gynecology, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet Medical Center (Table
1). The chemotherapy agents used are detailed in Table 2. Forty-eight effusions were obtained at diagnosis
before chemotherapy administration. Among the
remaining 47 specimens obtained postchemotherapy,
43 were tapped at disease relapse, and 4 were tapped
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for primary disease.
Nine breast carcinoma effusions (8 pleural, 1 peritoneal) from 9 patients aged 33-81 years (mean, 57
years) diagnosed with infiltrating duct carcinoma were
also analyzed. Four effusions were tapped before
chemotherapy administration, and 4 were postchemotherapy specimens. Treatment status was unknown
for 1 patient.
Effusions were submitted for routine diagnostic
purposes to the Pathology Clinic at RikshospitaletRadiumhospitalet Medical Center during 1999–2005.

beads (BD Biosciences) for multicolor FCM setup, as
previously described.22 A mixture of T47-D breast
carcinoma cells, HS-Sultan Burkitt lymphoma cells,
and leukocytes served as positive controls.

Evaluation and scoring of FCM immunophenotyping
This was undertaken in a standardized way by using
CellQuest Software version 3.4 (BD Biosciences). A
gating procedure was generated by displaying sideangle light-scatter channel (SSC) versus 7-AAD/
CD45-PerCP fluorescence (7-AAD was detected in
the FL3 channel), and a region was drawn around
clear-cut populations having 7-AAD2/CD45-PerCP2
fluorescence. Cells in this region were reviewed by
generating a cytogram displaying SSC versus FSC
and were gated to exclude cell debris by including
only cells with relatively high SSC and FSC values.
Quadrant cursors were set by using isotypic controls,
so that 99% of cells were localized in the left lower
quadrant in negative controls. Cell populations were
interpreted as immunoreactive for a given antibody
only when unequivocal separation from the negative
controls was demonstrated.
The percentage of viable carcinoma cells expressing Fas, DR4, DR5, TNFR1, and TNFR2 was scored.
Expression in <1% of cells was scored as negative.
The minimum number of viable carcinoma cells
allowed was 1000.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by applying the
SPSS-PC package (Version 13; SPSS, Chicago, Ill).
Probability of <.05 was considered significant. Survival data were available for 76 of 77 OC patients.
Analyses of the association between DR expression
and clinicopathologic parameters (effusions site, age,
histological grade, FIGO stage, previous chemotherapy, response to chemotherapy at diagnosis, and first
disease recurrence) were undertaken by using the

87

Mann-Whitney U test. For these analyses and for
survival analyses, clinicopathologic parameters were
grouped as follows: Age: 60 years versus >60 years;
grade: 1-2 versus 3; FIGO stage: III versus IV;
response to chemotherapy for primary disease and
for disease recurrence: complete response versus partial response or stable disease or disease progression
or allergic reaction or adverse reaction. Analysis of
the association with response to chemotherapy for
primary disease was limited to primary diagnosis
specimens. Analysis of the association between DR4
and DR5 expression was performed using the Student t test for paired data. Comparative analysis of
receptor expression in OC versus breast carcinoma
was performed by using the Mann-Whitney U test.
Univariate survival analyses of overall survival
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were executed by using the Kaplan-Meier method and logrank test. For these analyses, Fas, DR4, and DR5
expression were grouped as low versus high based
on median values. Because TNFR1 and TNFR2 were
expressed only in approximately 50% of cases, their
expression was analyzed as positive versus negative.
In the survival analysis, only expression levels for the
first obtained specimen were included. Multivariate
survival analysis was performed by using the Cox
proportional hazard model.

RESULTS
Carcinoma Cells in Effusions Commonly Express
Death Receptors
Carcinoma cells were detected in all ovarian and
breast cancer effusions by using the Ber-EP4 antibody. Receptor expression data are shown in Table 4
and illustrated in Figure 1. DR4 and DR5 were significantly coexpressed in both tumor types in paired
analysis (P < .001 and P 5 .008 for OC and breast
carcinoma, respectively). Comparative analysis of OC
and breast carcinoma showed significantly higher
Fas expression in OC (P 5 .047), with nonsignificant
differences for the remaining 4 receptors.
Because some OC patients present without malignant effusions, we analyzed cell suspensions from
20 primary carcinomas (7 serous, 7 endometrioid, 2
clear cell, 3 undifferentiated, 1 mixed serous and
endometrioid carcinoma) from patients with reactive
effusions with no cancer cells, or no effusion, before
and during primary operation. As in effusions, we
observed frequent expression of Fas (19 of 20, 95%),
DR4 (17 of 20, 85%), and DR5 (14 of 20, 70%) but
infrequent presence of TNFR1 (3 of 20, 15%) and
TNFR2 (5 of 20, 25%) (Fig. 1).

Death Receptor Expression in OC Cells in Effusions
Is Associated With More Advanced Disease
We analyzed the association between DR expression
and clinicopathologic parameters in OC. Higher DR4
(P 5 .005) and TNFR2 (P 5 .041) expression were
associated with FIGO stage IV compared with
stage III disease. No association was found with effusion site, histological grade, patient age, or previous
administration of chemotherapy (P > .05, data not
shown).
Death Receptor Expression in OC Effusions Is Associated
With Poor Chemotherapy Response
Response to chemotherapy at diagnosis was available
for 69 of 75 patients who received this treatment and
was as follows: complete response 5 41, partial response 5 11, stable disease 5 1, progression 5 12,
other (allergic response or bone marrow toxicity) 5 4
patients. Response to chemotherapy at first disease
recurrence was known for 53 of 59 patients who
received it and was as follows: complete response 5
11, partial response 5 7, stable disease 5 5, progression 5 27, other (allergic response or bone marrow
toxicity) 5 3 patients. Comparative analysis was performed for patients with complete response versus
all other groups. DR expression levels showed no
association with response to chemotherapy administered for primary disease (P > .05, data not shown).
Higher DR4 (P 5 .006), DR5 (P 5 .01), and Fas (P 5
.001) expression was associated with poor response
to chemotherapy at disease recurrence.
Death Receptor Expression in OC Effusions Predicts
Worse Outcome
Follow-up period and OS for the 76 OC patients with
available survival data ranged from 1 month to 80
months (mean, 23 months). PFS ranged from 0–35
months (mean, 6 months), with 29 patients never
achieving disease-free status. At last follow-up, 59
patients were dead of disease, 13 were alive with dis-

ease, and 3 had no evidence of disease. One patient
was lost to follow-up.
In our cohort, comprising nonmatched prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy effusions, FCM
did not detect differences in the expression of any of
the 5 analyzed receptors between the 2 effusion types.
We, therefore, analyzed the association between DRs
and survival in the entire cohort.
In univariate survival analysis, higher DR4 expression correlated with poor OS (P 5 .0352) and PFS
(P 5 .0411) (Fig. 2). All receptor expression data and
clinicopathologic parameters associated with OS or
PFS with a P < .2 that were entered in the Cox analysis are detailed in Table 5.
In Cox analysis for OS, DR4 expression was an
independent predictor of poor OS (P 5 .008). Additional parameters that correlated with poor OS were
histological grade 3 (P 5 .029), FIGO stage IV (P 5
.026), and response to chemotherapy for primary disease (P 5 .012), and recurrent disease (P 5 .014).
Cox analysis for PFS showed comparable findings for DR4 (P 5 .003). Additional parameters that
correlated with poor PFS were similar to those
observed for OS as follows: histological grade 3 (P 5
.029), FIGO stage IV (P 5 .007), and response to
chemotherapy for primary disease (P 5 .003), and
recurrent disease (P 5 .001).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we used FCM to detect DR expression
in OC and breast carcinoma in effusions. In addition
to its high sensitivity and reproducibility, FCM facilitates the study of multiple markers simultaneously.
We previously found that carcinoma cells can be
detected and differentiated from other cell types in
effusions (leukocytes, mesothelial cells) using FCM,
by employing a panel of markers including Ber-EP4
and CD45.23 The addition of the DNA intercalator

plasma membrane, enabled us to exclude dead cells
from our analysis.
We detected Fas expression in the majority of OC
and breast carcinoma cases, with significantly higher
expression levels in OC effusions. The frequent
expression of Fas in OC is in concordance with previous studies. In 2 immunohistochemical studies of
Fas expression in primary OC, immunoreactivity
was detected in 43 of 63 and in 34 of 34 specimens.25,26 In an additional study, Fas mRNA expression was found in 24 of 25 primary and 14 of 14
recurrent OC specimens of unspecified anatomic
site, with Fas protein detected in all cases by Western blotting.27 The authors further documented Fas
expression in 3 primary OC cultures by using FCM.
Interestingly, the primary OC cultures were significantly less sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis compared with normal ovarian epithelial primary
cultures, although they expressed a greater level of
Fas.27 Our observation that higher Fas expression in
OC effusions is associated with poor response to
chemotherapy at disease recurrence is compatible
with the last finding.
TNFR1 was found in 49% and 33% of our OC
and breast carcinoma cases, respectively. TNFR2 was
detected in approximately 50% of cases of both
tumor types. Limited previous data are available. In a
study by Naylor et al., immunostaining for TNFR1
was positive in 12 of 12 primary OC and was confined to tumor cells. In contrast, TNFR2 was absent
from carcinoma cells but localized to the tumor-

stromal interface and to macrophages within the malignant gland lumina.28 Blocking of TNFR2 in the
OC cell line CAOV-3 resulted in some inhibition of
TNF-a mediated cytolysis,29 suggesting a proapoptotic role for this receptor. In contrast, TNFR2 expression was associated in our study with a more
advanced (FIGO stage IV) disease, possibly reflecting
involvement of this receptor in tumor progression.
This hypothesis is supported by the findings that
TNF-a is produced by OC cells isolated from ascites
specimens and that it functions as an autocrine and
paracrine growth factor at this anatomic site.30
In our cohort, DR4 and DR5 expression was
detected in the majority of specimens, with strong
coexpression of these 2 receptors in both OC and
breast carcinoma effusions. This concurs with the
study by Horak et al., in which coexpression of these
receptors was found in primary OC.31 The comparable presence of DRs in OC and breast carcinoma
effusions suggests that their expression may be a
generalized phenomenon in cancers affecting the
serosal cavities.
Analyzing 20 primary OCs, we observed frequent
expression of Fas, DR4, and DR5 but infrequent
presence of TNFR1 and TNFR2. This may suggest
that ovarian cancer cells frequently express the former 3 receptors already at the primary tumor phase.
The clinical significance of various components
of the TRAIL signaling pathway in OC has been
recently investigated. Arts et al. reported on the
increased immunostaining of DR5 but not of TRAIL,

Patients with effusions with higher DR4 expression (n 5 37, dashed line)
had mean PFS of 6 months versus 9 months for patients whose effusions
showed low DR4 expression (n 5 39, solid line; P 5 .0411). Curve begins
below 1.0 because some patients had PFS 5 0 months.

DR4, or DcR1 in postchemotherapy residual tumors
compared with matched primary tumors.32 In our series of nonmatched prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy effusions, no difference in DR4 or DR5
levels was observed between these 2 specimen types.
Possible reasons for this discrepancy between the
results by Arts et al. and our findings may be the different choice of method (immunohistochemistry versus FCM) and specimens (solid tumors versus
effusions), as well as the expression pattern scored as
positive (cytoplasmic versus membranous localiza-

tion). Lancaster et al. showed that TRAIL expression
was higher in OC from long-term survivors (>5
years) versus short-term survivors (<1 year),33
whereas Horak et al. found no prognostic role for tumor cell TRAIL expression in OC.31 The expression
levels of the long form of c-FLICE inhibitory protein
(c-FLIPL), capable of blocking caspase-8 cleavage,
showed no association with patient survival.31
Our data show that DR4 expression in OC effusions is associated with parameters of aggressive
clinical behavior, including FIGO stage IV disease,
poor response to chemotherapy at disease recurrence, and poor OS and PFS. DR5 expression similarly correlated with poor response to chemotherapy.
The correlation between DR4 expression and poor
survival was reproduced in multivariate analysis. In a
previous study of primary OC, DR4 and DR5 expression did not correlate with survival.31 This difference
concurs with our earlier observations of extensive
molecular differences between primary tumors and
metastatic cells in effusions.34
Several mechanisms underlying the association
between high DR expression and aggressive disease
have been proposed. In vitro data implicate the
involvement of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)
in colon, breast, and ovarian cancer cell resistance to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis.35–37 We recently found
XIAP expression in 94% of OC effusions and observed
its up-regulation at this anatomic site compared with
primary tumors and solid metastases.38 Survivin,
another inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family member,
was present in 88% of effusions. The DR-IAP link
and its effect on apoptosis in OC merit further
research, particularly in view of the ability of DRs to
transcriptionally up-regulate IAP expression through
NF-jB activation.39,40 In addition, DR-induced ERK
activation is generally associated with an antiapoptotic function,36,41 as is Akt activation.42

Overexpression of the decoy receptors DcR1 and
DcR2 may result in a death-inhibitory effect. DcR1
prevents the DISC assembly by competing for TRAIL
binding,43 whereas DcR2 associates with DR5 to
form a nonfunctional DISC.43,44 In addition, DcR2
overexpression prevents apoptosis through NF-jB
activation.45 Because OC cells that are TRAIL-resistant (SKOV-3.ip1 and COV-2) or TRAIL-sensitive
(OVCAR-3, CAOV-3) have comparable levels of these
2 decoy receptors,46 their clinical relevance remains
to be established.
Soluble DRs may hinder apoptosis signaling as
well. A soluble decoy receptor for Fas ligand, DcR3,
has been characterized and reported to be expressed
in lung and colon cancer.47 Osteoprotegerin is the
only soluble TRAIL receptor known to date. Although
its main activity is inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by
binding to the TNF-like cytokine TRANCE/RANKL, it
also binds TRAIL and blocks this route of apoptosis
signaling.48 The role of these receptors in ovarian
cancer is unknown.
In a recent study, OC effusion supernatants protected OVCAR-3 and CAOV-3 cells from TRAILinduced and FasL-induced apoptosis.49 This effect
was mediated by Akt phosphorylation, which resulted
in decreased activation of caspase-3 and reduced
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Aktdependent increase in the levels of the short form of
c-FLIP (c-FLIPS) was also observed after incubation
of CAOV-3 cells with effusion fluid, suggesting inhibition of the apoptotic signal at the DISC level.49 The
involvement of the c-FLIPL isoform in mediating resistance to TRAIL has also been documented.46,50
Our data suggest that the effusion microenvironment
confers similar protection against DR-induced apoptosis on cancer cells in clinical specimens. This
would be in agreement with our previous finding
that PARP cleavage is minimal in OC cells in effusions.51
In conclusion, the first analysis of DR expression
in tumor cells in effusions shows frequent expression
of these molecules in both OC and breast carcinoma.
The association between the presence of Fas, TNFR2,
DR4, and DR5, and parameters of clinically aggressive behavior in OC, including poor response to
chemotherapy, may suggest that cancer cells in effusions are protected from DR-induced apoptosis. DR4
independently predicts poor survival in OC effusions.
