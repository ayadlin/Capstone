ABSTRACT
Overexpression of the ErbB2/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase occurs in up to 20%
of human breast cancers and correlates with aggressive disease. Several efficacious
targeted therapies, including antibodies and kinase inhibitors, have been developed
but the occurring of resistance to these agents is often observed. New therapeutic
agents targeting the endocytic recycling and intracellular trafficking of membrane in
tumor cells overexpressing ErbB2 are actually in clinical development. Nevertheless
the mechanisms underlying ErbB2 downregulation are still obscure. We have
previously demonstrated that the overexpression of the p130Cas adaptor protein in
ErbB2 positive breast cancer, promotes tumor aggressiveness and progression. Here
we demonstrate that lowering p130Cas expression in breast cancer cells is sufficient to
induce ErbB2 degradation by autophagy. Conversely, p130Cas overexpression protects
ErbB2 from degradation by autophagy. Furthermore, this autophagy-dependent
preferential degradation of ErbB2 in absence of p130Cas is due to an increased ErbB2
ubiquitination. Indeed, the overexpression of p130Cas impairs ErbB2 ubiquitination by
inhibiting the binding of Cbl and CHIP E3 ligases to ErbB2. Finally, our results indicate
that p130Cas-dependent ErbB2 protection from degradation by autophagy may alter
the sensitivity to the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Consistently, in
human ErbB2 positive breast cancers that develop resistance to trastuzumab, p130Cas
expression is significantly increased suggesting that elevated levels of p130Cas can
be involved in trastuzumab resistance.

INTRODUCTION

and to identify therapeutic strategies to overcome the
resistance. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the
acquirement of resistance including the poor internalization
of ErbB2 resulting in a long half-life at the plasma
membrane [4–7]. Although it has been shown that Hsp90
inhibition can induce ErbB2 ubiquitination followed by its
downregulation [8, 9], the mechanisms underlying ErbB2
downregulation are still obscure.
p130Cas is a signaling molecule involved in the
linkage of actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix
during cell migration, cell invasion and cell transformation.
p130Cas protein has been described as a major player
in the cross-talk between EGF Receptor and integrins

Molecular and clinical studies indicate that ErbB2 has
important implications in tumor etiology and progression.
Overexpression of ErbB2 (Her2/Neu), is involved in the
pathogenesis of nearly 20–30% of invasive breast cancers
and is associated with an aggressive phenotype. Although
ErbB2 overexpression identifies patients who are likely
to respond to therapy with trastuzumab, not all patients
benefit from treatment. Approximately 15% of patients
relapse after therapy due to de novo or acquired resistance
[1–3]. Therefore, intense investigations are necessary to
understand the factors that contribute to the resistance

[10]. Due to its modular structure, p130Cas has been
shown to play a crucial role in signaling originating from
many amplified or mutated oncogenes, by undergoing
hyperphosphorylation and association with multiple
signaling partners required for transformation [11–13].
The overexpression of p130Cas in the mammary
gland leads to hyperplasia and delayed involution but
does not promote tumorigenesis [14]. Double transgenic
mice originated by crossing MMTV-p130Cas and
MMTV-NeuT mice, which express the oncogenic form of
the rat neu gene, homologous to human ErbB2, showed
an accelerated onset of mammary tumor formation.
Moreover, the analysis of human breast samples revealed
that tumors overexpressing both p130Cas and ErbB2
are characterized by an elevated proliferation index
[14]. Our previous data demonstrated that p130Cas is an
essential transducer element in ErbB2 transformation and
progression showing that p130Cas is necessary for ErbB2dependent foci formation, anchorage-independent growth,
in vivo tumor growth and metastatization [15]. Moreover,
we have reported that p130Cas over-expression promotes
ErbB2-dependent invasion in three-dimensional (3D)
cultures of human mammary epithelial cells and we have
identified the gene expression changes underlying this
invasive behavior [16, 17].
Moreover, p130Cas has been proposed as a crucial
modulator of both anti-estrogen and adriamycin resistance
[18, 19].
Here we demonstrate that in breast cancer cells
overexpressing ErbB2, p130Cas protects ErbB2 from
autophagy-mediated degradation by interfering with
its ubiquitination. Moreover, changes on the receptor
ubiquitination caused by modulation of p130Cas
expression leads to expression of different types of
autophagic markers, suggesting a link between ErbB2
degradation and autophagy in a p130Cas-dependent
manner. Here we show for the first time that high levels
of p130Cas expression might be crucial to promote
resistance to trastuzumab treatment by protecting ErbB2
from degradation.

cells (Figure 1A). Interestingly, when we evaluated ErbB2
expression in these cell lysates, we found that p130Cas
expression modulation results in changes of ErbB2
expression levels. Indeed, lowering p130Cas expression
in BT474 cells (Figure 1A) is sufficient to cause ErbB2
downregulation. The same results were obtained by
performing experiments in ErbB2 positive breast cancer
cell line SKBR3, further supporting the expression
correlation between ErbB2 and p130Cas (Supplementary
Figure 1A). To exclude that the ErbB2 downregulation
is an off-target effect of sh-p130Cas sequence, we tested
four different sequences and we confirmed that lowering
p130Cas expression results in ErbB2 downregulation
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Consistently, overexpression
of p130Cas leads to an increase of ErbB2 expression
(Figure 1A). These changes in ErbB2 expression upon
modulation of p130Cas expression, were not dependent
on alterations of HER2 gene transcription as shown in
Figure 1B, (right panel) but rather to its availability on the
cell membrane as demonstrated by FACS analysis (Figure
1C). In addition, the alterations of ErbB2 expression upon
modulation of p130Cas expression were highly specific,
since no expression changes were observed for Hsp90 and
ER alpha (Figure 1D).
Therefore, these data indicate that modulation of
p130Cas expression in breast cancer cells is sufficient to
strongly affect ErbB2 expression.

p130Cas silencing drives proteasome independentErbB2 degradation
Little attention has been paid to the role of ErbB2
degradation in cancers, although when compromised, it
may lead to increased ErbB2 levels and activity. Several
studies have shown that endocytic downregulation of
ErbB2 is impaired in cancer cells although there is
poor understanding of how this is achieved [4, 20].
It was recently demonstrated that treatment of ErbB2
positive SKBR3 and BT474 breast cancer cell lines
with proteasome inhibitor causes a 50% downregulation
of ErbB2 protein expression ([21] and Supplementary
Figure 2), indicating that ErbB2 degradation is proteasome
independent. In addition, p130Cas has been recently
described to regulate cell sensitivity to proteasome
inhibition [22].
To understand whether ErbB2 altered protein levels,
as a consequence of modulation of p130Cas expression,
implicate proteasome activity, we treated p130Cas
silenced, p130Cas overexpressing and relative BT474
control cells for 16 hours with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132. As shown in Figure 2, proteasome inhibition
induces ErbB2 degradation in control cells, as previously
demonstrated. However, we observed a significant
increased degradation of ErbB2 in p130Cas silenced cells
compared to control cells following treatment with 2 µM
of MG132 for 16 hours, while overexpression of p130Cas
minimizes the degradation of ErbB2 upon proteasome

RESULTS
Modulation of p130Cas expression interferes with
ErbB2 protein stability
To investigate the relevance of the modulation of
p130Cas expression in the control of ErbB2 stability we
used, as an experimental model, ErbB2 positive BT474
breast cancer cells. We infected cells with lentiviruses
expressing either p130Cas shRNAs or scramble control
shRNA sequences, and lentiviruses overexpressing
p130Cas with related control vectors. Within 48 hours,
p130Cas expression was effectively silenced by about
80% compared to cells infected with scramble sequences,
while p130Cas overexpression resulted in about 30–40%
increase of protein expression compared to control infected

inhibition. Interestingly, these data indicate that lowering
p130Cas expression can lead to further degradation of
ErbB2, while the overexpression of p130Cas protects
ErbB2 from degradation. Moreover, treatment of
p130Cas silenced and relative BT474 control cells with
cycloheximide with or without MG132, indicates that
ErbB2 degradation is prompted in p130Cas-silenced
conditions (Supplementary Figure 3).
It was previously demonstrated that ErbB2
degradation upon proteasome inhibition leads to the
formation of cytosolic aggregates directed to lysosomal
degradation [23]. Consistently, the treatment of control
(Ctr) cells with MG132 induced a reduction of ErbB2
level and an increased amount of the autophagic markers
LC3-II (Figure 2 left and right panels), indicating that

the induction of autophagy correlates with decreased
ErbB2 protein levels. Noteworthily, the downregulation
of p130Cas is sufficient to lower ErbB2 expression
and to enhance the conversion of LC3-I to its lipidated
form LC3-II respect to the control and to the p130Cas
overexpressing cells, suggesting that p130Cas-dependent
ErbB2 degradation is due to an increased activation of
the autophagic process. These experiments were also
performed in SKBR3 cell lines showing the same results
(Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B).
Most interestingly, high levels of p130Cas expression
that protect ErbB2 from degradation correlate with low
expression of the autophagy marker LC3-II independently
of proteasome inhibition. These data indicate that in
ErbB2 positive cells silenced for p130Cas and treated

with MG132, p130Cas inhibition leads to a stronger
activation of the autophagic flux leading to increased
ErbB2 degradation whereas p130Cas overexpression is
sufficient to impair autophagy thereby preventing ErbB2
degradation.

not significantly affect ErbB2 expression levels indicating
that the overexpression of p130Cas renders ErbB2
less sensitive to autophagy degradation. Moreover, the
concomitant treatment of HBSS and Chloroquine results
in the re-establishment of ErbB2 expression in p130Cas
silenced cells upon autophagy inhibition (Figure 3A)
and the concomitant accumulation of LC3-II expression,
confirming that absence of p130Cas favors ErbB2
degradation through autophagy.
Accordingly, as shown in Figure 3B (left and right
panels), the treatment with Chloroquine (100 µM) was
sufficient to restore ErbB2 levels in both control and
p130Cas silenced cells, while in p130Cas overexpressing
cells did not result in a significant change in the amount
of ErbB2 expression. Therefore, these results indicate
that blocking the autophagic flux, as demonstrated by the
increased expression of the lipidated form of LC3, rescues
ErbB2 expression in both control and p130Cas silenced
cells.

p130Cas expression level alters sensitivity of
breast cancer cells to autophagy
To demonstrate that the p130Cas expression can
interfere with the autophagic degradation of ErbB2, Ctr,
p130Cas silenced and overexpressing BT474 cells were
starved and cultured for 6 hours in presence of HBSS
(Hank’s balanced salt solution) to induce autophagy alone
or in combination with Chloroquine, a drug that arrests
the latter step of autophagy, resulting in the failure of
the autophagy process [24]. Cell lysates from control,
p130Cas silenced and overexpressing cells were collected
and western blot analysis performed. The results shown in
Figure 3A (left and right panels) confirm that in untreated
cells, silencing of p130Cas is sufficient to induce ErbB2
downregulation by autophagy as demonstrated by LC3II upregulation. In addition, the induction of autophagy
by HBSS treatment leads to approximately 50%
reduction of ErbB2 in Ctr cells compared to untreated
cells demonstrating that autophagy is implicated in
the degradation of ErbB2. The effectiveness of HBSS
treatment to trigger the autophagic flux is confirmed by the
presence of the lipidated form of LC3. Most interestingly,
in p130Cas overexpressing cells the HBSS treatment does

p130Cas-dependent ErbB2 degradation by
autophagy is regulated by mTOR activity
It is known that class I and class III of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) can regulate autophagy
in different ways. In cancer cells the growth factor receptorinduced activation of class I PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, inhibits
autophagy. Conversely, class III PI3K activity is required for
the sequestration of cytoplasmic material that characterizes the
autophagic process [25, 26].

In addition, we have previously demonstrated that
p130Cas overexpression in ErbB2 transformed cells leads
to the activation of mTOR [17]. Therefore, to identify
which autophagy signaling pathways were specifically
involved in p130Cas-mediated ErbB2 degradation, we
treated control, p130Cas silenced and overexpressing
BT474 cells for 16 hours with the mTOR activator
MHY1485 (2 µM) to block autophagy [27] and with
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (100 nM) to induce autophagy.
The results in Figure 4 indicate that treatment with
Rapamycin in p130Cas silenced cells increased ErbB2
degradation. As expected, LC3-II expression was present
following p130Cas silencing in control cells and was
strongly upregulated in cells treated with Rapamycin.
Conversely, experiments performed by treating cells with

the mTOR activator, indicate that the resulting inhibition
of autophagy is sufficient to reverse ErbB2 levels in
p130Cas silenced BT474 cells, further confirming the
key role of p130Cas in affecting signaling leading to
autophagy that is instrumental for ErbB2 degradation.
Importantly, p130Cas overexpressing cells were less
prone to undergo autophagic degradation induced by
Rapamycin. The inhibition of autophagy in cells treated
with the mTOR activator is supported by low levels of
LC3 expression and increased p62/sequestosome-1 protein
expression. The same results were obtained by using the
inhibitor of class III PI3K wortmannin, known to inhibit
autophagy (data not shown) [25]. These data show that
ErbB2 degradation by autophagy depends on p130Cas
expression levels, with low levels of p130Cas sensitizing

ErbB2 to authophagy degradation and high p130Cas levels
protecting it from degradation.

ErbB2 ubiquitination in presence or absence of p130Cas
can be due to an impaired accessibility of ErbB2 by
its E3 ligases. To this end, ErbB2 immunoprecipitates
from BT474 cells in which p130Cas was silenced or
overexpressed were probed with Cbl and CHIP antibodies.
The results show that both CHIP and Cbl association to
ErbB2 is highly increased in p130Cas silenced cells
(Figure 5C), indicating that the binding of p130Cas to
ErbB2 is sufficient to interfere with its polyubiquitination
by reducing the binding of E3 enzymes, pointing out an
uncovered chaperone function for p130Cas.

p130Cas protection of ErbB2 from ubiquitination
It has been recently demonstrated that ubiquitin
can be a crucial element to target protein aggregates to
selective autophagy [28]. Therefore, we speculated that
p130Cas can modify ErbB2 sensitivity to autophagy
degradation by affecting its ubiquitination status.
Therefore, ErbB2 was immunoprecipitated from
p130Cas silenced or overexpressing BT474 cells and
the immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-ubiquitin
antibodies. As shown in Figure 5A, greater amounts
of ubiquitinated ErbB2 were observed upon p130Cas
silencing compared to control cells. In addition,
higher levels of p130Cas were associated with lower
ubiquitination of ErbB2. Western blotting analysis on the
same cell extracts were performed to verify changes in
ErbB2 level after modulation of p130Cas (Figure 5B).
These results indicate that the presence or absence
of p130Cas can affect the ubiquitination of ErbB2. Since
CHIP and Cbl E3 ligases have been reported to associate
with ErbB2 and to mediate its ubiquitination [29–31]
and we have previously demonstrated that p130Cas
immunoprecipitates with ErbB2 ([15] and Supplementary
Figure 5), we tested whether the observed differences of

p130Cas sustains ErbB2 stability and resistance
to trastuzumab
Since activation of ErbB2 downstream signaling and
increased ErbB2 stability are hallmarks of resistance to
trastuzumab treatment [32], we hypothesized that p130Cas
can be a mediator of trastuzumab resistance. To examine
whether p130Cas levels of expression is involved in
trastuzumab resistance, experiments were performed in
ErbB2 overexpressing BT474 and SKBR3 made resistant
to trastuzumab [33]. Sensitive and resistant cells were first
compared for levels of p130Cas mRNA and protein levels
by performing quantitative real-time PCR and western
blot analysis. The results indicate that transcription
of p130Cas mRNA and its expression is upregulated

phospho-S6, S6, p62, LC3 and GAPDH as loading control. Right panel: Histograms show ErbB2, p62 and LC3 II levels, normalized to

in resistant SKBR3R and BT474R cells compared to
wt cells suggesting a functional role of p130Cas in the
acquired resistance to trastuzumab (Figure 6A and 6B).
To assess whether the increased stability of ErbB2
following p130Cas-dependent inhibition of autophagy is
a possible mechanism to induce resistance to trastuzumab,
p130Cas overexpressing BT474 cells and relative controls
were treated for 24 hours with rapamicyn (100 nM) and
trastuzumab (10 µM) alone and/or in combination.
As shown in Figure 6C, the treatment of cells with
rapamycin and trastuzumab does not affect significantly
the expression of ErbB2, whereas the combination of
treatments results in downregulation of ErbB2, confirming
what previously observed in preclinical studies using
mTOR inhibitor and trastuzumab alone or in combination
[34, 35]. Notably, the overexpression of p130Cas, as
expected, is sufficient to induce the expression of ErbB2
and to prevent its downregulation in the combined
treatment observed in control cells. These results indicate
that the overexpression of p130Cas can be one important
factor that contributes to trastuzumab resistance.
To further assess the involvement of p130Cas
in clinical resistance to trastuzumab, we evaluated the
correlation between p130Cas expression and failure
to trastuzumab-based therapy in ErbB2 positive breast
cancer patients. Therefore, we assessed the expression of
p130Cas in ErbB2 positive primary tumors of 11 patients
and in the relapsing trastuzumab resistant counterparts. As

shown in Table 1, 8 out of 11 tumors showed an increase in
p130Cas expression at the time of progression. Moreover,
3 out of 11 tumors were already 2+/3+ for p130Cas at
first diagnosis of breast cancer and they retained this high
p130Cas positivity after trastuzumab treatment (Figure
6D). These data suggest that high levels of p130Cas may
promote acquired resistance to trastuzumab therapy in
ErbB2 positive breast cancer.
Overall our results indicate that the modulation
of p130Cas expression correlates with alterations of
ErbB2 expression, and in particular we demonstrated that
p130Cas protects ErbB2 from autophagy degradation.
This protection from degradation points out p130Cas as
a crucial player in ErbB2 resistance to targeted therapy.

DISCUSSION
Here we demonstrate for the first time that the adaptor
protein p130Cas can act as a protecting agent against
ErbB2 degradation. Consistently, we show that lowering
p130Cas expression is sufficient to get ErbB2 degraded
while p130Cas overexpression increased ErbB2 stability
at the cell membrane. Our data also show that p130Casdependent ErbB2 degradation occurs preferentially by
autophagy rather than by proteasome. Interestingly, we have
demonstrated that the presence of p130Cas can impair the
binding of the ErbB2 with its E3 ligases CHIP and Cbl,
resulting in a defective ubiquitination.

We have previously extensively shown that
p130Cas supports and amplifies ErbB2 downstream
signaling pathways both in vivo and in vitro promoting
tumorigenesis and progression [14–17]. Here we describe
for the first time one possible mechanism through which
p130Cas can affect ErbB2 tumorigenesis. Our present data
indicate that p130Cas by binding to ErbB2, stabilizes the
receptor preventing its ubiquitinylation and subsequent
degradation by selective autophagy. Indeed p130Cas by
binding to ErbB2 does not allow the association with
CHIP and Cbl E3 ligases, possibly due to steric hindrance.
Conversely, low levels of p130Cas allows the binding
of CHIP and Cbl E3 ligases to ErbB2 promoting its
degradation by autophagy.
It was previously inferred that ErbB2 receptor is
resistant to down-regulation by endocytosis, probably
because of its association to Hsp90 chaperone that
might prevent due to steric hindrance the binding of E3
ligase to ErbB2 resulting in impaired ubiquitinylation
and degradation [23]. Indeed Hsp90 inhibitors, such
as geldamycin, induces a rapid ubiquitin-dependent

degradation of the receptor [8, 9, 20, 36]. We can speculate
that p130Cas mirrors in ErbB2 positive breast cancer the
function of Hsp90, protecting ErbB2 from degradation
but at the same time, assembling a signaling platform that
sustains and reinforces breast cancer growth, migration
and invasion.
Our data also points out that lowering p130Cas is
sufficient to induce ErbB2 degradation that preferentially
occurs by autophagy rather than by proteasome.
Interestingly, it has been speculated that the
docking of proteins to be degraded to the ubiquitinproteasome system (UPS) or to the autophagy—lysosomal
pathway depends on the differential attachment of
ubiquitin moieties. The association with K48-linked
polyUb chains will represent the recognition signal for
proteasome degradation, whereas the K63-linked chains
may preferentially target substrates to degradation by
autophagy [23, 28, 37, 38].
In parallel, it has been recently proposed in SKBR3
breast cancer cells that ErbB2 degradation is proteasome
independent and that the conjugation of K63-linked

polyubquitin chains to ErbB2 might be relevant to target
its degradation by the autophagy-lysosomal system [21,
23]. On the basis of these data we can speculate that in the
absence of p130Cas the observed ErbB2 degradation by
autophagy might be dependent by an increased amount of
K63 linkages that in turn are recognized by the autophagy
receptors and finally degraded. Further investigations
are needed to verify this hypothesis and to identify the
molecular players involved in p130Cas-dependent ErbB2
degradation and/or stability.
Nevertheless, the translational importance of the
levels of p130Cas expression in the regulation of ErbB2
stability is evident. Indeed, the p130Cas silencing in a
therapeutic setting will contribute to ErbB2 degradation
and thereby to limitations of its oncogenic properties,
whereas the overexpression of p130Cas by protecting
ErbB2 from autophagy can be implicated in resistance
to trastuzumab treatment. Our data indeed indicate that
high levels of p130Cas expression inversely correlate
with ErbB2 sensitivity to trastuzumab and the induction
of autophagy is not sufficient to promote its degradation.
The mechanism through which p130Cas mediates
resistance to trastuzumab might rely on the increased
ErbB2 stability to the cell membrane. However, it has
been reported that increased autophagosome formation
in trastuzumab resistant cells preserves breast cancer cell
survival [39]. These opposite data can be reconciled by the
fact that overexpression of p130Cas drives resistance to
trastuzumab by increasing ErbB2 stability and by blocking
the receptor ubiquitination and thus its degradation,
regardless of activation of downstream autophagy flux.
Our and others previous and current results indicate
that high levels of p130Cas are hallmarks of breast cancer
progression, invasion, metastatization and resistance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[11, 13, 40]. However, the mechanisms through which
p130Cas expression is upregulated in breast cancer still
remain an open question.
In conclusion, we provided evidence that p130Cas
overexpression prevents ErbB2 degradation by autophagy.
The resulting increased stabilization of ErbB2 by
p130Cas might be the crucial event driving breast cancer
progression and resistance, strengthening the relevance
of p130Cas as an unfavorable prognostic marker and
a putative therapeutic target to overcome resistance to
trastuzumab based treatment in ErbB2 positive breast
cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies
p130Cas mAbs have been previously described
[41]. ErbB2 NCL-L-Cb11 mAbs were purchased from
Novocastra (Leica Microsystems Srl, Germany). An
additional mAb directed to the cytoplasmic domain of
ErbB2 were prepared in our laboratory, by immunizing
mice with a recombinant protein encompassing amino acids
1031–1160 of rat ErbB2 cDNA sequence. mAbs to Vinculin
were from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). Antibodies to
c-Src, p-Tyr PY99, Actin, Cbl and CHIP were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA). pTyr416 c-Src
and Beclin-1 antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly,
MA,USA). Mono- and polyubiquitinylated conjugates
antibody was from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY).
LC3 polyclonal antibody was from Thermo Scientific Pierce
Antibodies (Rockford, Illinois). Secondary antibodies
conjugated with peroxidase were from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA).

mix). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 g for
10 minutes and the supernatants were collected and
assayed for protein concentration with the Bio-Rad protein
assay method (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were
run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Following
SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose,
incubated with specific antibodies and then detected
with peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies and
chemoluminescent ECL reagent. When appropriate,
the nitrocellulose membranes were stripped according
to manufacturers’ recommendations and re-probed.
Densitometric analysis was performed using the GS 250
Molecular Imager (Biorad).
For immunoprecipitation assay, 1 mg of cell extracts
were immunoprecipitated with ErbB2 antibody and then
probed for specific antibodies.
For ubiquitination experiments, 10 mg of cell extracts
were immunoprecipitated with ErbB2 antibody. After
blotting, the membrane were pre-incubated with denaturing
buffer (6 M guanidine-HCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl ph 7.5, 5
mM b-mercapto-ethanol, 1 mM PMSF) for 30′ at 4°C and
washed in PBS buffer. Then the membrane was blocked with
5% BSA in TBS buffer for 6 hours at room temperature and
incubated overnight at 4°C with the anti-ubiquitin antibody.

SKBR3 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A–15%
FBS and BT474 cell lines were cultured in DMEM-F12
with 10% FBS. SKBR3 and BT474 resistant cells were
respectively cultured in RPMI-1640 10% FBS and
DMEM 10% FBS. SKBR3 and BT474 made resistant to
trastuzumab were generated by Dr. Valabrega as described
in [33].

Proteasome and autophagy experiments
For proteasome inhibition experiments, MG132
(CAS-133407-82-6, Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany)
was directly added into medium at a concentration of
0.5, 2 and 6 µM for 16 hours. Cycloheximide was used
at 100 mg/ml and purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA). For autophagy induction cells
were cultured in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS,
Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
for 2, 4 and 6 hours. For autophagy pharmacological
inhibition, cells were treated with the PI3-kinase inhibitor,
wortmannin (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) at
100 nM and with chloroquine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA), an inhibitor of autophagosome formation at
100 µM for 16 hours. For mTOR inhibition cells were
treated with rapamycin (Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA) at 100 nM for 16 hours. For resistance
experiments, cells were treated for 20 hours with
trastuzumab (10 microg/ml) or Rapamycin (100 nM) or
with combination of both.

RNA isolation and qRT-PCR for mRNA detection
Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol™
Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). 1 μg of DNAse-treated RNA (RQ1 RNaseFree DNase kit, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was
retrotranscribed with High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Quantitative PCR was performed on an
Applied Biosystems, 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System
(standard settings) using the Universal Probe Library
system (Roche Italia, Monza, Italy) and Platinum™
Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Results were analyzed
with the 2−ΔΔCt method using the 18 S rRNA predeveloped
TaqMan assay (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) as an internal control. The median expression
across samples was used as calibrator.

Lentivirus generation
A pLKO.1 lentiviral vector carrying a shRNA
directed to human p130Cas (p130Cas shRNA) was
selected in the pLKO.1 target gene shRNA set (clone ID
TRCN0000115985), purchased from Open Biosystem
(Huntsville, AL, USA, http://www.thermoscientiﬁcbio.
com). pLKO.1 scramble shRNA vector (Addgene,
Cambridge, MA, USA, http://www.addgene.com)
was used as negative control. Lentiviral particles were
generated and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (50,000 g,
2 hours). BT474 and SKBR3 cells were infected with the
lentiviral p130Cas-shRNA (sh-p130Cas) and scrambleshRNA (Ctr). Puromycin (Sigma) (0.5 mg/ml) was added
24 hours after infection with PLKO.1 vectors as described
in [42]. For p130Cas expression, human p130Cas cDNA,
mouse p130Cas cDNA were cloned into pCCL lentiviral
vector, and viral particles production was performed as
described in [42].

In vitro cell assays
For proliferation assay, MTT (4,5 dimethyl-2-yl
2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) from Sigma Chemical
Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA) was performed on SKBR3 and
BT474 upon treatment with freshly added trastuzumab
(Herceptin) (2 µg/ml) for 4 days. For FACS analysis
cells were stained with ErbB2 mAb and with Alexa
488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Alexa 488 emission was detected
in the green channel (525 nm) following excitation by a
488 nm laser on a FACS Calibur cytometer (Becton,
Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

Immunobloting and immunoprecipitation analysis
Cells were extracted with RIPA buffer (1% Triton
X-100, 0,1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl ph 7, 0.4 mM Na3VO4, inhibitor
