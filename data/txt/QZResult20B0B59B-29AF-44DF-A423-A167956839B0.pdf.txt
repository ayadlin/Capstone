ABSTRACT:
Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor. Temozolomide
(TMZ) is the standard chemotherapeutic agent for this disease. However, intrinsic
and acquired TMZ-resistance represents a major obstacle for this therapy. In order
to identify factors involved in TMZ-resistance, we engineered different TMZ-resistant
glioblastoma cell lines. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that EFEMP1, an
extracellular matrix protein, is associated with TMZ-resistant phenotype. Silencing
of EFEMP1 in glioblastoma cells resulted in decreased cell survival following TMZ
treatment, whereas overexpression caused TMZ-resistance. EFEMP1 acts via
multiple signaling pathways, including γ-secretase-mediated activation of the Notch
pathway. We show that inhibition of γ-secretase by RO4929097 causes at least
partial sensitization of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide in vitro and in vivo. In
addition, we show that EFEMP1 expression levels correlate with survival in TMZtreated glioblastoma patients. Altogether our results suggest EFEMP1 as a potential
therapeutic target to overcome TMZ-resistance in glioblastoma.

INTRODUCTION

may develop acquired TMZ-resistance during treatment.
Therefore, TMZ-resistance represents a major obstacle in
the treatment of this disease.
The cytotoxic effect of TMZ is mainly mediated
through induction of the DNA adduct O6-methylguanine
(O6M-G) resulting in activation of the mismatch repair
(MMR) system, induction of DNA double strand breaks,
and subsequent cell death [3, 4]. The alkylation of the O6
position of guanine can be counteracted by the MGMT
protein (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase). It is
widely accepted that hypermethylation of the promoter of
the MGMT gene in the tumor tissue can predict sensitivity
to TMZ [5–7], since hypermethylation prevents the
expression of MGMT thereby sensitizing the cells to TMZ

Glioblastoma is the most common malignant
primary brain tumor in humans. Outcome for glioblastoma
patients is dismal, and carries a median survival of only
14 months [1]. Standard treatment consists of surgery
(if possible), followed by radiotherapy and adjuvant
temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy [1, 2]. Although
the addition of TMZ to radiotherapy has resulted in an
overall increase in survival of glioblastoma patients,
therapy still fails in almost all glioblastoma patients due to
incomplete tumor resection, and/or the apparent resistance
of tumor cells to irradiation and TMZ. Some tumors are
insensitive to TMZ already at diagnosis, whereas others

[8, 9]. The highly relevant role of MGMT in response
to TMZ is confirmed by the increased sensitivity when
combining TMZ with the competitive MGMT inhibitor
O6-benzylguanine [10–12]. Also the MMR status can
be important for TMZ sensitivity, as a functional MMR
mechanism is required to induce double strand breaks,
and subsequent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [3, 4, 13].
Defects in MMR have been suggested to be involved
especially in acquired TMZ-resistance [14–16]. Besides
the canonical MGMT and MMR TMZ-resistance
mechanisms it is likely that non-canonical mechanisms can
also contribute to TMZ-resistance. Further insight into the
underlying mechanisms of non-canonical TMZ-resistance
mechanisms may not only allow for better prediction of
treatment response, and thus to individualized therapy,
but may also provide targets for counteracting TMZresistance.
EFEMP1 (Fibulin-3) is an extracellular matrix
protein involved in tumor progression in several types
of cancer [17–20]. In glioblastoma, EFEMP1 has been
reported to stimulate tumor growth, invasion of tumor
cells, and resistance to apoptosis [21, 22]. EFEMP1 can
exert these tumor promoting effects through activation of
the Notch signaling pathway [22], although EFEMP1 was
also reported to activate EGFR and the downstream AKT/
PI3K/mTor, and MAPK pathways [19, 23]. Activation
of the Notch cascade has been previously implicated in
TMZ-resistance in glioblastoma, and plays an essential
role in determining cell fates such as differentiation,
proliferation, and apoptosis [24–26]. Here we identify
by gene expression profiling of both TMZ-sensitive and
non-canonical TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cell lines that
expression of EFEMP1 is associated with a TMZ-resistant
phenotype. Furthermore, we show that EFEMP1-mediated
TMZ-resistance is regulated – at least partly – through the
Notch pathway.

significant differences were observed between the parental
cell line and the resistant subclones (Supplementary
Table S1), suggesting that a non-canonical TMZresistance mechanism was acquired by these cells, and
– consequently - resulting in a useful tool to study noncanonical TMZ-resistance.
In order to determine which non-canonical
mechanisms are responsible for the observed TMZresistance, we isolated RNA from the parental glioblastoma
cells (designated WT) and the two independent TMZresistant subclones (designated R1 and R2). We performed
gene expression array analysis and a significance analysis
of microarrays (SAM analysis) using a false discovery rate
of <10%. We identified transcripts that were differentially
expressed between the WT and R1/R2 glioblastoma cells
of each individual glioblastoma cell line and overlapping
transcripts among the different resistant glioblastoma cells
(Fig. 1B). Genes that were differentially expressed in at
least five out of six TMZ-resistant glioblastoma subclones
are depicted in heatmap format (Fig. 1C). The top-6
transcripts overexpressed in all six resistant subclones
were validated by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1D). EFEMP1 emerged
as the most differentially expressed mRNA in all three
glioblastoma cell lines with >2-fold (p<0.05) increased
EFEMP1 expression in the TMZ-resistant glioblastoma
subclones (Fig. 1D). Moreover, by comparing the IC50
values of the WT, R1, and R2 glioblastoma cell lines to the
corresponding EFEMP1 expression levels, we identified a
positive correlation between these two variables (r2=0.56,
p=0.021) (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that
EFEMP1 expression is associated with a TMZ-resistant
phenotype.

RESULTS

To determine whether EFEMP1 can act as a sole
effector of non-canonical TMZ-resistance in glioblastoma
cells, we overexpressed EFEMP1 in Hs683 cells. We
compared the EFEMP1 expression levels of Hs683EFEMP1 cells to Hs683-WT and Hs683-R1 cells by
qRT-PCR and showed a >3-fold upregulation of EFEMP1
in Hs683-EFEMP1 cells compared to Hs683-WT cells
(Fig. 2A). We then treated Hs683-EFEMP1, Hs683WT, and Hs683-R1 cells with TMZ, and measured cell
viability four days later. The overexpression of EFEMP1
resulted in a significant increase in resistance to TMZ
as compared to the parental Hs683 cells (Fig. 2B). The
resistance effect of EFEMP1 overexpression in Hs683
cells was confirmed by clonogenic assays (Figs. 2C and
D), which showed a significant increase in clonogenic
survival of Hs683-EFEMP1 cells as compared to Hs683WT cells. Conversely, >80% knock down (p<0.05) of
EFEMP1 by siEFEMP1 as demonstrated by qRT-PCR
(Fig. 2E), resulted in reduced cell survival of TMZ-

In order to develop TMZ-resistant glioblastoma
cells, we treated Hs683, U87, and LNZ308 glioblastoma
cells twice a week with 33 µM TMZ for several weeks,
resulting in two independent stable TMZ-resistant
subclones for each glioblastoma cell line. The TMZ
sensitivity was determined by automated cell counting at
four days post-TMZ treatment (Fig. 1A). The IC50 values
of the resistant glioblastoma subclones showed >2-fold
increase in TMZ-resistance compared to the parental cell
lines (Supplementary Table S1). These cell lines were

that HES1 and/or HEY1 were >2-fold overexpressed
(p<0.05) in the TMZ-resistant cells, except for U87-R1.
Subsequently, we determined whether blocking of the
Notch pathway could overcome the EFEMP1-mediated
resistance to TMZ, by treating the Hs683-WT and
Hs683-R1 glioblastoma cells that demonstrated high
expression of HES1/HEY1 with TMZ and the γ-secretase
inhibitor (GSI) DAPT (Fig. 3C). Treatment of Hs683-R1
with DAPT in the absence of TMZ resulted in a 20%
decrease in cell viability (p<0.05), which was not observed
in Hs683-WT cells. Importantly, in combination with
TMZ, treatment with DAPT resulted in enhanced cell
kill as compared to TMZ alone (Fig. 3C). Subsequently,
we assessed the inhibitory effects of the clinically
available GSIs RO4929097, BMS-708163, LY450139,
and MK-0752 on the Notch pathway by determining
HES1 expression after GSI treatment (Fig. 3D). At

resulted in the largest reduction (approximately 75%,
p<0.05) of HES1 expression in Hs683-R1 glioblastoma
cells. Therefore, we selected RO4929097 for combined
treatment with TMZ on Hs683-WT and Hs683-R1 cells.
Similar as for treatment with DAPT (Fig. 3C), RO4929097
treatment alone resulted in decreased cell viability
and in combination with TMZ, RO4929097 treatment
significantly enhanced cell kill compared to TMZ alone in
the TMZ-resistant Hs683-R1 cells (Fig. 3E). In addition,
we demonstrated similar effects of combined treatment
with TMZ and RO4929097 on U87-WT and U87-R1 cells
(Fig. 4A) and on primary glioblastoma cell lines (Fig. 4B).
These primary glioblastoma cells were characterized for
their MGMT promoter methylation status and MGMT

with RO4929097 potentiated the TMZ effect on U87-R1

Moreover, these results support previous reports on TMZsensitizing effects of GSIs in glioblastoma cells [24–26].

glioblastoma cells were injected into the striatum of nude
mice (n=24). Six days post-implantation the luciferase
signal was measured and mice were randomized into
four treatment groups (i.e. CTRL; TMZ; RO4929097;
TMZ+RO4929097; n=6 per group). Directly after
randomization, mice were treated with TMZ and/or
RO4929097 for five consecutive days. At day 1 and 5
of treatment, mice were treated with only RO4929097
while on day 2, 3, and 4 mice were treated with both TMZ
and RO4929097 or corresponding vehicles. We assessed
glioblastoma growth over time by Fluc bioluminescence
imaging. Fluc activity demonstrated that treatment with
TMZ+RO4929097 significantly reduced Hs683-Fluc
tumor growth in vivo compared to tumor growth in nontreated mice (p=0.023) (Figs. 5A-C), although under
these devastating conditions we were not able to measure
significant effects on survival (survival 18±6 days after
injection of the Hs683-Fluc cells). These results suggest
that inhibitors of the Notch pathway may sensitize

EFEMP1 expression correlates to TMZ treatment
efficacy and survival in glioblastoma patients
In order to determine the clinical relevance of
EFEMP1 in glioblastoma, we determined the EFEMP1
expression levels in multiple publicly available
glioblastoma datasets [27–34] using the microarray
analysis and visualization platform R2 (http://r2.amc.nl)
and showed a significant overexpression of EFEMP1 in
glioblastoma tissues as compared to non-neoplastic brain
tissue (Fig. 6A). Next we analyzed whether EFEMP1
expression is a predictive biomarker candidate for the
efficacy of TMZ treatment in glioblastoma patients.
Therefore, we analyzed overall survival of glioblastoma
patients treated with or without TMZ (TMZ-treated
n=82, not TMZ-treated n=70, www.rembrandt.org) in
correlation with EFEMP1 expression. When EFEMP1

DISCUSSION

non-neoplastic tissue, red and green line), patients had a
worse prognosis in the TMZ-treated group (Fig. 6B, upper
panel), while no difference in survival was observed in
the non-TMZ treated group (Fig. 6B, lower panel).
Correspondingly, patients with low EFEMP1 expression
(<2-fold increased compared to non-neoplastic tissue,
blue and purple line) had a relatively good prognosis
when treated with TMZ (Fig. 6B). Thus, EFEMP1 is a
significant biomarker candidate for survival in the TMZtreated group (p=0.044), but not in glioblastoma patients
that are not treated with TMZ (p=0.46). These results
suggest that EFEMP1 overexpression is predictive for the
resistance to TMZ in glioblastoma patients. Finally, we
determined if EFEMP1 expression levels had increased
in patient samples upon progression of disease following
TMZ treatment. Therefore, EFEMP1 mRNA expression
was determined by qRT-PCR in relapse samples and
compared to their expression in the corresponding
samples at diagnosis. Although we had a limited number
of samples, a clear trend could be observed towards an
increased expression of EFEMP1 in glioblastoma samples
at the time of progression (Fig. 6C), suggesting that
EFEMP1 could be used as a marker for tumor progression
after TMZ treatment.

Glioblastoma is the most common malignant
primary brain tumor with a median survival rate of 14
months. While adding TMZ to radiotherapy results in
an overall increase in survival of glioblastoma patients,
almost all patients die. Multiple TMZ-resistance
mechanisms have been demonstrated, including
activity of MGMT [8, 9], MMR [14, 15], but also BER
resistance mechanisms [35–37], and drug efflux pumps
[38]. However, it is unlikely that these mechanisms are
responsible for all TMZ-resistance observed. Here we
attempted to determine non-canonical factors that may
influence the efficacy of TMZ in glioblastoma. Using
gene expression analysis of both TMZ-sensitive and
TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cell lines, we demonstrated
that overexpression of EFEMP1 is associated with a TMZresistant phenotype in glioblastoma cells.
EFEMP1 (Fibulin-3) belongs to the family of fibulin
proteins, which are secreted proteins that integrate into
the extracellular matrix. These proteins form anchoring
structures that were reported to regulate cell proliferation,
adhesion, and migration [39, 40], and several fibulins
have been associated with the development of solid

tumors [39, 40]. EFEMP1 is not significantly expressed
in normal brain [21, 27, 41, 42], however, it is highly
expressed in high-grade gliomas, where it promotes tumor
growth and invasion [21, 22]. Glioblastomas consist of
different molecular subtypes, i.e. classical, mesenchymal,
neural, and proneural glioblastoma subtypes [43]. It was
previously described that EFEMP1 is a mesenchymalrelated gene highly expressed in primary brain tumors [21,
44]. In addition, EFEMP1 levels were higher in gliomas
of the mesenchymal subtype compared to the proneural
subtype which have poor overall survival compared to the
other subtypes [22]. It would be of interest to determine
whether EFEMP1 expression correlates with TMZ
resistance and survival in this glioblastoma subclass.
In contrast, a recent report [45] identified patients with
glioblastomas of the proneural subtype enriched as
responders to Notch inhibition via γ-secretase inhibitors.
These proneural glioblastomas were characterized by high
Notch pathway activation. Yet unknown is whether these
patients also have increased levels of EFEMP1 expression.
Here we demonstrate a significant role for EFEMP1
in TMZ-resistance of glioblastoma cells. At this point,
however, inhibitors of EFEMP1 are not yet available.

EFEMP1 can act on multiple pathways, including EGFR
[19], and the downstream pathways MAPK [19], and
AKT/PI3K/mTor [19, 20, 23]. Moreover, EFEMP1 has
been identified as an activator of Notch signaling which
results in increased invasion, tumor cell self-renewal,
chemoresistance, and glioblastoma growth [22]. It was
postulated that EFEMP1 can serve as a target that restricts
anti-invasive and chemosensitizing effects to tumor cells
without the pleiotropic effects of current pharmacologic
inhibitors of Notch [22]. In our study, we show that
EFEMP1 overexpression activates the Notch pathway
in TMZ-resistant glioblastoma, while interference with
the Notch pathway conveys partial sensitivity to TMZresistant glioblastoma cells. It should be noted that Notch
signaling can also be activated in an EFEMP1-independent
manner. Therefore, it remains to be determined what the
exact contribution of EFEMP1 to Notch signaling is in
TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cells in relation to other
factors that can induce Notch signaling, including MAGP1/2, CCN3, YB-1, DLL, and Jagged [46–51]. Furthermore,
as mentioned above, EFEMP1 can act on other pathways,
including EGFR which could also convey resistance to
glioblastoma cells and could explain that only partial

sensitization to TMZ treatment is observed upon Notch
inhibition. Considering this, it would be of interest to
examine the potential involvement of these pathways in
providing TMZ-resistance.
Although we were able to demonstrate significant
effects of RO4929097 on TMZ sensitivity in vitro, and as
measured by a reduction of orthotopic Hs683-Fluc tumor
growth in mice in vivo, we were not able to measure
significant effects on survival between the different
treatment groups, which we mainly attribute due to the
relatively large variation in survival upon growth of these
devastating orthotopic Hs683-Fluc tumors in the brains of
mice. Supportive of our results are the previous reports on
Notch pathway inhibitors synergizing with TMZ treatment
in other glioblastoma models [24–26]. And, importantly,
the first clinical trial of the GSI RO4929097 with TMZ
treatment in glioblastoma patients has been initiated
(http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01119599). It would
be of interest to determine whether EFEMP1 expression
levels correlate with the effect of GSIs and TMZ on patient
survival in this patient group. Moreover, blood plasmabased assays are available to quantify secreted EFEMP1
expression levels [52]. Further research is needed to
determine whether EFEMP1 level in glioblastoma tissue
and/or in blood could serve as a stratification marker for
the treatment of patients with TMZ and/or GSIs.
In conclusion, we provide evidence for a role of
EFEMP1 in TMZ-resistance in glioblastoma. Inhibition
of EFEMP1 and/or its downstream signaling components
may be a potential therapeutic venue for the sensitization
of glioblastoma cells to TMZ.

which were not treated with TMZ were cultured in parallel
to use as controls for further analysis. To generate Hs683
cells overexpressing EFEMP1, cells were transfected with
an EFEMP1-overexpression construct kindly provided by
Dr. M.S. Viapiano (The Ohio State University Medical
Center and James Comprehensive Cancer Center,
Columbus, OH, USA). Transfected glioblastoma cells
were selected using 250 µg/ml of Zeocin Selection
Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For in vivo
experiments, Hs683 cells were stably transduced with a
lentivirus vector encoding firefly luciferase (Fluc) [53]
to establish Hs683-Fluc cells. Primary glioblastoma
cells, MGG4, MGG6, MGG8, and MGG23 were kindly
provided by Hiroaki Wakimoto (Massachusetts General
Hospital, Boston, MA, USA), and cultured as previously
described [54]. The cells used in this study were not
authenticated.

Gene expression profiling
Gene expression profiling was performed at the
VUmc array core facility as described elsewhere [55, 56].
Briefly, RNA samples were Cy3- or Cy5-labeled using the
Agilent Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit Plus,
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently,
equal amounts (825 ng) of the Cy3 and Cy5 labeled
samples were hybridized to Agilent 4×44K Whole Human
GE arrays (Agilent), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples derived from each individual
glioblastoma cell line (both parental cell line and resistant
subclones) were hybridized on a single slide. Slides were
scanned using an Agilent Microarray scanner (G2565BA).
Image analysis was performed using feature extraction
software version 9.5 (Agilent Technologies). The Agilent
GE2-v5_95 protocol was applied using default settings.
Array normalization was performed with R-package
Limma within the Bioconductor software. The microarray
data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), Series
Accession Number GSE53014.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
Human glioblastoma cell lines Hs683, U87, and
LNZ308 were cultured in DMEM (PAA Laboratories,
GmbH, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (PAA Laboratories, GmbH, Pasching,
Austria), and 1 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (both
PAA Laboratories, GmbH, Pasching, Austria) at 37°C
and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. TMZ (Schering
Plough, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare a stock concentration of 150
mM which was further diluted in cell culture medium to
the working concentration. To generate TMZ-resistant cell
lines, parental cells were treated twice a week in duplicate
with a clinically relevant concentration of TMZ (33 µM).
Exposure to TMZ was continued for multiple weeks (1018 weeks), until two individual resistant subclones were
generated of each parental glioblastoma cell line. TMZresistant cells were regularly challenged with 33 µM TMZ
to maintain the resistant phenotype. Passage controls

qRT-PCR
Quantitive RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was used
to determine the relative expression levels of EFEMP1,
HES1, HEY1, and GAPDH mRNA. Total RNA from cell
lines was isolated using TRIzol RNA isolation protocol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and total RNA from
paraffin-embedded glioblastoma tissue was isolated
using the RecoverAllTM Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit
(Ambion, USA). Equal amounts of RNA were converted
into cDNA using Omniscript kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Subsequently, qRT-PCR was performed
with primers designed using Primer-Blast (NCBI) and
manufactured by Invitrogen. The Ct values were used to

data were normalized to GAPDH expression levels.

vehicle p.o., while the RO4929097-treated group received
30 mg/kg RO4929097 p.o. and vehicle i.p.. The combined
treatment group was injected with the same concentration
of TMZ i.p. and RO4929097 orally. Mice were treated
once daily for five consecutive days with RO4929097 or
vehicle and on day 2, 3, and 4 with TMZ or vehicle. Mice
were sacrificed after the humane endpoints were reached
via sedation using isoflurane followed by i.p. injection
of Euthasol. To assess significant differences between
treatment groups, mice with Fluc bioluminescence values
within each treatment group outside the mean ±2 x SD
range were excluded from further analysis.

Cell viability/survival assays
Cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated the
subsequent day with increasing concentrations of TMZ
and/or the γ-secretase inhibitors RO4929097, DAPT,
BMS-708163, LY450139, MK-0752 (SelleckChem,
Houston, TX, USA). Four days after treatment, cells were
fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and DNA was stained
with DAPI diluted in PBS (0.3 µg/ml). Cell number was
assessed by counting the number of DAPI-stained cells
using the Acumen Ex3 laser scanning cytometer (TTP
LabTech, Royston, UK). Clonogenic assay was performed
by plating single cells in 6-well plates. Three different
cell dilutions (each in duplicate) were used per plate.
For siRNA experiments, cells were cultured in a 6-well
plate, transfected after 24 hrs with 66 nM of siEFEMP1 or
siCTRL using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), and plated as single cells subsequent day in
three different cell dilutions. The next day, cells were
treated with different drug concentrations. After 11-14
days, colonies were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7%
formaldehyde, stained with Giemsa staining (1:10 in demi
water), washed with water to remove the excess of Giemsa,
and air dried. The number of colonies was determined by
marking the stained colonies containing ≥50 cells using
light microscopy. The survival fraction was determined
by normalizing the number of colonies formed in the
treatment condition to the number of colonies formed
in the control condition [number of colonies formed /
(number of cells plated x plating efficiency)]. Plating
efficiency is defined as the percentage of cells plated that
actually formed colonies in the control group.

Statistical analysis
Difference in biological properties between treated
and untreated cells was analysed using two-sided Student’s
t-test. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant. SAM analysis (false discovery rate <10%)
was used to determine significantly differential expressed
genes in the gene expression microarray data [57].
Pearson’s correlation was used to determine association
between IC50 values and EFEMP1 mRNA expression.
Survival curves were compared by log-rank test.
