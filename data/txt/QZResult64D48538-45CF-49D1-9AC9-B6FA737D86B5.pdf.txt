Abstract
While the therapeutic activity of the deoxycytidine analogue
decitabine is thought to reflect its ability to reactivate
methylation-silenced genes, this agent is also known to trigger
p53-dependent DNA damage responses. Here, we report that
p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase (p53R2/RRM2B) is a
robust transcriptional target of decitabine. In cancer cells,
decitabine treatment induces p53R2 mRNA expression, protein expression, and promoter activity in a p53-dependent
manner. The mechanism of p53R2 gene induction by
decitabine does not seem to be promoter DNA hypomethylation, as the p53R2 5¶ CpG island is hypomethylated before
treatment. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting of DNA
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in wild-type p53 cells leads to
genomic DNA hypomethylation but does not induce p53R2,
suggesting that DNMT/DNA adduct formation is the molecular
trigger for p53R2 induction. Consistent with this idea, only
nucleoside-based DNMT inhibitors that form covalent DNA
adducts induce p53R2 expression. siRNA targeting of p53R2
reduces the extent of cell cycle arrest following decitabine
treatment, supporting a functional role for p53R2 in decitabine-mediated cellular responses. To determine the clinical
relevance of p53R2 induction, we measured p53R2 expression
in bone marrow samples from 15 myelodysplastic syndrome/
acute myelogenous leukemia (MDS/AML) patients undergoing
decitabine therapy. p53R2 mRNA and protein were induced in
7 of 13 (54%) and 6 of 9 (67%) patients analyzed, respectively,
despite a lack of methylation changes in the p53R2 promoter.
Most notably, there was a significant association (P = 0.0047)
between p53R2 mRNA induction and clinical response in
MDS/AML. These data establish p53R2 as a novel hypomethylation-independent decitabine gene target associated with
clinical response. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9358–66]

pharmacologic inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase enzymes
(DNMT) as anticancer agents (2, 3). The two DNMT inhibitors in
current clinical use are the cytidine analogue 5-azacytidine and
the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine (5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine;
Dacogen). These agents are suicide substrates that incorporate into
DNA following enzymatic conversion and form covalent adducts
with DNMT proteins present at the replication fork (4). Early studies
of 5-azacytidine and decitabine used these drugs at high doses to
achieve an anti-metabolite–driven cytotoxic mechanism of action
(5). In contrast, recent clinical studies have used lower doses of these
agents directed at reversing tumor-specific gene silencing and
promoting tumor cell differentiation (6). The success of the latter
strategy in phase III clinical studies led to Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval of 5-azacytidine and decitabine for
treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; refs. 6, 7).
Despite the success of these agents as treatments for MDS, the
basis for their activity, and to what extent it is related to reversal of
epigenetic gene silencing, is unresolved (8). Gene expression
profiling studies in cancer cell lines have revealed transcriptional
responses to DNMT inhibitors that include activation of methylation-silenced tumor-suppressor genes, as well as induction of
distinct groups of genes not hypermethylated in tumor cells (9). As
the result of these and other studies, at least three distinct
mechanisms have been proposed to explain therapeutic responses
to decitabine, including (a) activation of methylation-silenced
tumor-suppressor genes such as p15INK4b (10, 11); (b) activation
of cancer-testis or cancer-germline tumor antigen expression and
MHC class I expression, which may provoke antitumor immunity
(12–14); and (c) activation of p53-mediated DNA damage responses
(15, 16). Consistent with the last mechanism, MDS, the malignancy
for which decitabine therapy is FDA approved, rarely displays p53
mutations (17–19). Furthermore, decitabine treatment has been
observed to induce p53-mediated DNA damage responses in vitro
at clinically relevant concentrations (15, 16), and pifithrin-a,
a selective p53 inhibitor (20), reverses the growth-inhibitory and
apoptotic effects of 5-azacytidine treatment in colon cancer cells
(21). The mechanism by which 5-azacytidine and decitabine lead
to DNA damage and p53 activation may be related to cellular
recognition of DNMT/DNA adducts or to structural changes in
chromatin caused by global genomic DNA hypomethylation (3, 22,
23). Further support of a key role for the activation of DNA damage
pathways in the cellular response to decitabine comes from recent
reports indicating that decitabine treatment activates classic DNA
damage detection and signaling molecules, including ATM, CHK1,
and g-H2AX (24, 25).
Here, we report the discovery of a novel transcriptional target of
decitabine treatment, p53R2/RRM2B, which plays a key role in the
resolution of cellular DNA damage by providing deoxynucleotide

triphosphates (dNTPs) to allow DNA repair to proceed in cells
undergoing cell cycle arrest in response to p53 activation (26, 27).
We show that decitabine treatment induces p53R2 expression in a
p53-dependent manner, via a mechanism likely involving the
formation of covalent DNMT/DNA adducts but not involving
promoter DNA hypomethylation. In addition, we show that p53R2
induction occurs in response to treatment with other nucleoside
analogue-based DNMT inhibitors and that its induction functionally contributes to cell cycle arrest in tumor cells responding to
decitabine treatment. Most notably, we show that p53R2 induction
occurs in vivo in the bone marrow of MDS/AML patients treated
with decitabine and that its induction directly correlates with
clinical responses to decitabine.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and drug treatments. HT29, HCT116, and RKO colorectal
cancer cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
and were cultured as described previously (15). LOVO colorectal cancer cells
were obtained from ATCC and were cultured using the same conditions as
described for RKO (15). RKO cells expressing human papilloma virus E6
oncoprotein (RKO E6 cells) were a kind gift from Dr. Mark Meuth (Institute
for Cancer Studies, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom) and
were cultured as described for RKO (15). Decitabine (5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine), 5-azacytidine, zebularine [1-(h-D-ribofuranosyl)-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one], and RG108 (N-phthalyl-1-tryptophan) were obtained from
Sigma Chemical Company. The first three drugs were dissolved in 1
PBS, whereas RG108 was dissolved in DMSO. Drug concentrations and time
points for specific experiments are described in the text and figure legends.
Human tissue samples. Fifteen patients with MDS (n = 10), AML
(n = 4), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; n = 1) by WHO
criteria (28) were treated with decitabine administered as 15 mg/m2 i.v. over
3 h every 8 h for 3 d, repeated every 6 wk (29), or as 20 mg/m2 i.v. over
1 h daily for 5 d, repeated every 4 wk (30). Bone marrow aspirations were
performed pretreatment and at recovery from cycles 2, 4, 6, etc., and cells
were cryopreserved under an institutional review board (IRB)–approved
protocol. Response to treatment was defined using the 2006 International
Working Group criteria (31). The laboratory study was approved by the IRB.
Cryopreserved bone marrow samples were briefly thawed in a 37jC water
bath, and contents were separated to obtain RNA, DNA, and cytosolic
protein extracts. For RNA extractions, bone marrow cells were pelleted via
centrifugation at 4jC and the supernatant was removed. Trizol (500 AL;
Invitrogen) was added to the pellet and the suspension was homogenized
with a pestle motor (VWR International). After complete homogenization,
an additional 500 AL of Trizol were added and the sample was mixed by
pipetting up and down several times. Subsequent extraction steps were
performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. For DNA
isolation, genomic DNA was isolated using the Puregene kit (Gentra
Systems). For protein isolations, cytosolic protein fractions were isolated
using the NE-PER kit (Pierce Biochemical) according to the specifications of
the manufacturer. A motor pestle was used in steps that required
suspension of cell pellet in buffer. Twenty-five to 30 Ag of protein extracts
were used for Western blot analysis.
Northern blot analysis. Northern blot analyses were performed as
described previously (32). The p53R2 probe was generated by reverse
transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) of the p53R2 mRNA using the following
primers: F: 5¶-GACTTGAGAAGACAGTTTGATCC-3¶ and R: 5¶-ATGCAGGCTTGGCTTGATTGACC-3¶.
Western blot analysis. Western blots were performed as described
previously (33). p53R2 was detected using the N-16 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNMT1 was
detected as described previously (34).
5¶ RNA ligase–mediated rapid amplification of cDNA end mapping.
5¶ RNA ligase–mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE)
mapping for the 5¶ end of the p53R2 mRNA was performed as described
previously (35). Primer sequences are available upon request.

Quantitative RT-PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed
as described previously (33). Primer sequences for p53R2 and GAPDH are
reported in Supplementary Table S1, and PCR conditions are available upon
request.
DNA methylation analyses. Global DNA methylation was assessed by
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry measurement of 5-methyldeoxycytidine, and methylation of the LINE-1 repetitive element was determined
by quantitative sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing as described previously
(36, 37). Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and sodium bisulfite sequencing
were performed as described previously (33). Primers for p53R2 methylation
analysis by MSP and sodium bisulfite sequencing are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Human genomic DNA modified with SssI (New England
Biolabs) served as a methylated DNA control, and testis DNA (BioChain
Institute) served as an unmethylated DNA control.
Small interfering RNA knockdowns. Transient small interfering RNA
(siRNA) knockdown of DNMT1 in RKO cells was performed as described
previously (33). Transient knockdown of p53R2 in RKO cells was
accomplished by transfecting cells once with 50 nmol/L p53R2si (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) or 50 nmol/L controlsi 2 (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
p53R2 promoter luciferase assays. A 572-bp fragment of the p53R2
gene, containing the intron 1 p53 binding site (27) was amplified from RKO
genomic DNA using the following primers: F: 5¶-ATTAAATGGCATGCCCAGGA-3¶ and R: 5¶-TGACACTGAGCCACTGGTCT-3¶. After gel purification,
the PCR product was cloned into the pcDNA 2.1 vector (Invitrogen),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting clones were
digested with XhoI and HindIII (Fermentas) and ligated into the pGL3basic vector (Promega), generating pGL3-R2. A previously described p53
binding site point mutation (27) was introduced into the construct using
the Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs),
generating pGL3-R2mut. The Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega)
was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For drug treatment experiments, cells were treated with decitabine at
day 0 and again at day 3. Twenty-four hours later (day 4), cells were
cotransfected with 50 ng of a Renilla construct (to normalize for
transfection efficiency) and 150 ng of pGL3-R2 or pGL3-R2mut using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell extracts were harvested for luciferase assays 24 h later (day 5).
For DNMT1 siRNA experiments, RKO cells were treated as described above
except that DNMT1-specific or control siRNAs (33) were transfected at
day 0 and again at day 3 posttreatment.
Cell cycle analyses. Triplicate wells of RKO cells in 6-well plates were
transfected with either 50 nmol/L sip53R2 or sicontrol as described
above. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with 1 PBS or 0.5 or
2.0 Amol/L decitabine. After 3 d, cells were trypsinized and 2  106 cells
were washed in PBS. Next, 100% ice-cold ethanol was added dropwise to
the cell pellet while vortexing. After a 30-min incubation on ice, cells
were spun down and the cell pellet was washed in 0.5% bovine serum
albumin. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in propidium iodide
staining solution (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.02 mg/mL RNase, 0.2% NP40,
0.05 mg/mL propidium iodide, 1 N HCl, in deionized water). Cells were
then incubated in the dark for 4 h, passed through an 18-gauge needle,
and analyzed using a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson) using
standard methods. Data were analyzed using ModFit LT (Verity Software
House).

Results
Identification and characterization of p53R2 as a p53dependent decitabine target gene. In a previous epigenomic
reactivation microarray screen (9, 34), we identified p53R2 as a
potential decitabine target gene in human cancer cells (data not
shown). As p53R2 is a p53 target gene (26, 27), its induction in
response to decitabine treatment was of interest based on
observations that p53 status affects cellular responses to pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of DNA methylation (15, 16, 22).

Cancer Research

To evaluate p53R2 as a decitabine target gene, we first measured
p53R2 mRNA expression in human colorectal cancer cells
following treatment with 0.5 or 5.0 Amol/L decitabine, which are
clinically relevant concentrations based on human pharmacokinetic studies (38, 39). Additionally, to examine the role of p53 in
this response, we used cell lines with differing p53 status,
including cells containing wild-type p53 (RKO, LOVO, and
HCT116), cells containing mutant p53 (HT29), and RKO cells
sustaining partial p53 disruption via the expression of a viral
oncoprotein (RKOE6). Decitabine treatment led to a robust
induction of p53R2 expression in LOVO and RKO cells, a lower
level of induction in HCT116 and RKOE6, and no induction in
HT29 (Fig. 1A). Thus, p53R2 induction by decitabine is drug
concentration as well as p53 dependent. Very similar results were
obtained when p53R2 protein expression was examined (Fig. 1B).
Of the three wild-type p53 lines studied, p53R2 induction was least
dramatic in HCT116 (Fig. 1A and B). This may be due to a general
impairment of p53R2 induction in this cell type as etoposide, a
classic DNA-damaging agent and p53 activator, robustly induces
p53R2 expression in RKO but not HCT116 cells, despite activating
p53 equally well in both cell types (Supplementary Fig. S1). In
addition, one allele of p53R2 is mutated in HCT116 (40),
suggesting that impaired p53R2 function may have been selected
for in the HCT116 tumor. Notably, activation of p53R2 by
etoposide treatment in RKO cells suggested that decitabinemediated p53R2 induction may not be a consequence of promoter
DNA hypomethylation.

We hypothesized that decitabine-mediated p53R2 induction may
be driven in part by transcriptional activation by p53. To test this,
we cloned a region of the p53R2 intron 1, which contains the p53
binding site (27), into a luciferase reporter construct and measured
its activity in decitabine-treated RKO cells as well as p53 mutant
HT29 cells (as a negative control). The activity of the reporter
construct was induced by decitabine in a concentration-dependent
fashion in RKO but not HT29 cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore,
decitabine-mediated reporter activation in RKO cells is dependent
on the presence of a wild-type p53 binding site (Fig. 1C). Taken
together, these data suggest that decitabine-mediated activation of
p53R2 involves direct transcriptional activation by p53.
The p53R2 5¶ CpG island is hypomethylated. To further
investigate the mechanism of p53R2 induction, we measured DNA
methylation of the p53R2 gene. Examination of the p53R2 5¶ region
revealed that it contains a large and dense CpG island flanking the
transcriptional start site (TSS; Fig. 2A). RLM-RACE analysis revealed
that the p53R2 TSS in human colorectal cancer cells is located
within this 5¶ CpG island and f80 to 200 bp downstream of the
National Center for Biotechnology Information–predicted TSS
diagrammed in Fig. 2A (data not shown). We initially used MSP
(41) to determine the methylation status of the p53R2 5¶ CpG island
in the cell lines described in Fig. 1. MSP revealed that two different
regions of the p53R2 5¶ CpG island, one upstream and one
downstream of the TSS, are hypomethylated at baseline, before
decitabine treatment, regardless of cellular p53 status (Fig. 2B). To
confirm this finding, we performed sodium bisulfite sequencing of

three different regions of the p53R2 5¶ CpG island in HCT116, RKO,
and LOVO cells. These analyses revealed that the p53R2 5¶ CpG
island region is fully hypomethylated at each region and in each cell
type (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S2). These data strongly suggest
that decitabine-induced hypomethylation of the 5¶ CpG island of
p53R2 does not contribute to decitabine-mediated p53R2 gene
activation in these cell lines. Also consistent with this idea, HCT116,
LOVO, and RKO cells each express low levels of p53R2 in the
absence of decitabine treatment (Fig. 1A and B). We also note that
there are no CpG sites near the p53 binding site in intron 1 (the
closest sites are 40 bp upstream and 128 bp downstream of the p53
binding site; Fig. 2A and data not shown), suggesting that
differential DNA methylation at the p53 binding site also does not
account for the induction of p53R2 by decitabine.
p53R2 expression is induced by nucleoside analogue-based
DNMT inhibitors but not by genetic targeting of DNMT1. We
next used a genetic approach to investigate the mechanism of
p53R2 induction by decitabine. We targeted DNMT1 using siRNA to
test whether global genomic DNA hypomethylation, or hypomethylation of other loci caused by DNMT1 loss, leads to p53R2
activation in decitabine-treated cells. We efficiently knocked down
DNMT1 expression in RKO cells using direct transfection of siRNAs

www.aacrjournals.org

as described previously (ref. 33; Supplementary Fig. S3). DNMT1
knockdown in RKO cells leads to global genomic DNA hypomethylation, as assessed by analysis of genomic 5-methyldeoxycytidine, to a similar extent as seen following decitabine treatment
(Fig. 3A). However, p53R2 mRNA expression was unaltered in RKO
cells following DNMT1 knockdown (Fig. 3B) and p53R2 protein
expression was similarly unaffected (Supplementary Fig. S3). In
addition, unlike decitabine, DNMT1 knockdown did not induce
p53R2 promoter activity (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data
suggest that genomic DNA hypomethylation does not induce
p53R2, but rather that this effect is linked to a different
characteristic of decitabine treatment. We speculate that p53R2
induction emanates from the formation of DNMT/DNA adducts
(42, 43). Supporting this idea, the loss of DNMT1 from the soluble
nuclear protein compartment of RKO cells following decitabine
treatment (which is a surrogate measure of DNA adduct formation)
parallels the drug concentrations at which p53R2 induction occurs
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Decitabine is one of three nucleoside analogue-based DNMT
inhibitors, each of which acts by trapping DNMT enzymes to DNA,
following their incorporation into DNA (2). The other two
compounds are 5-azacytidine, which is FDA approved for

by qRT-PCR 5 d posttreatment with the indicated concentrations of decitabine, 5-azacytidine (5-aza), zebularine, or RG108. RKO cells were treated with the
indicated concentrations of drugs at days 0 and 3 and cells were harvested at day 5 posttreatment. PBS serves as the vehicle control for the first three drugs, whereas

treatment of MDS, and zebularine, which is in preclinical testing
(2). In addition, a nonnucleoside and noncompetitive inhibitor of
DNMT1, RG108, has recently been described (44). To determine
whether p53R2 induction is characteristic of treatment with these
other DNMT inhibitors, we measured p53R2 expression in RKO
cells following treatment with each of these drugs (Fig. 3D). Both
decitabine and 5-azacytidine caused dose-dependent induction of
p53R2 expression, whereas zebularine treatment induced p53R2
only at the highest drug concentration, consistent with the lower
potency of this agent (ref. 25; Fig. 3D). In contrast, RG108 did not
induce p53R2 expression at any concentration (Fig. 3D). We noted
a slight effect of RG108 on global 5mdC levels, but not LINE-1
methylation, suggesting that this agent is capable of inhibiting DNA
methylation (Supplementary Fig. S5). Taken together, these data
suggest that p53R2 induction is a cellular response to covalent
DNMT/DNA adducts and not to genomic DNA hypomethylation
per se.
siRNA knockdown of p53R2 reduces decitabine-mediated G1
arrest. Decitabine treatment induces growth arrest in cancer cell
lines, characterized by G1 arrest and a reduction of cells in the

S phase (15, 45). To determine whether p53R2 is functionally
involved in this response, we used siRNA to down-regulate p53R2
expression in RKO cells responding to decitabine treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S6). We used flow cytometry in conjunction
with propidium iodide staining to quantify the proportion of RKO
cells in G1, S, and G2 following decitabine treatment. Notably,
p53R2 knockdown led to a significant reduction in the proportion
of cells in G1 and an increased proportion of cells in S and G2
following treatment of RKO cells with either 0.5 or 2.0 Amol/L
decitabine (Table 1). In contrast, p53R2 knockdown had little effect
on the cell cycle profile of untreated RKO cells (Table 1). These data
reveal that p53R2 induction functionally contributes to cell cycle
arrest elicited by decitabine treatment, primarily through activation of the G1-S checkpoint.
p53R2 expression is induced by decitabine therapy in vivo
and correlates with clinical response in MDS/AML. To
determine whether p53R2 induction is a characteristic of
decitabine therapy in vivo, we focused our attention on MDS and
AML, diseases for which decitabine is in current clinical use (6). We
obtained bone marrow samples from MDS (n = 10), AML (n = 4),

and CMML (n = 1) patients before and after a variable number of
courses of decitabine treatment. Figure 4A shows the results of
p53R2 expression analysis in 13 patients from whom sufficient RNA
was obtained for analysis. Notably, seven patients (54%) showed
significant induction of p53R2 (ranging from 4- to 38-fold) at a
minimum of one time point following drug treatment (Fig. 4A).
Overall, there was good concordance of p53R2 induction levels at
different treatment times within individual patients, with the
exception of patient 1, who showed a high level of p53R2 induction
only after the fourth cycle of therapy (Fig. 4A). Considering all data
points, 13 of 28 (46%) of posttreatment samples displayed >4-fold
p53R2 induction, and the difference in p53R2 expression pretreatment and posttreatment over the entire sample group was
statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. S7A). We measured
p53R2 protein expression by Western blot analyses in the nine
patients whose samples yielded sufficient protein for analysis
(Fig. 4B). Six of nine patients (67%) analyzed showed significantly
increased p53R2 protein expression (>1.5-fold induction) at one or
more time point after drug treatment (Fig. 4B). As with p53R2
mRNA induction, the level of p53R2 protein induction in patient
samples was in many instances similar to or greater than that
observed in decitabine-treated RKO cells (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, a
number of posttreatment samples displayed decreased migration
of p53R2 protein coincident with its induction (Fig. 4B), suggesting
that the induced protein could have altered posttranslational
modifications or that a novel form of p53R2 protein is induced. We
determined the methylation status of the central region of the 5¶
CpG island of p53R2 in pretreatment and posttreatment samples
from two patients showing robust p53R2 induction (pt. 8, 8c; pt. 14,
8c; Supplementary Fig. S7B). As shown, p53R2 was hypomethylated
both before and after decitabine treatment, suggesting that, similar
to what was observed in vitro, hypomethylation does not account
for p53R2 induction in vivo. In addition, the 3¶ region of the 5¶ CpG
island of p53R2 was also hypomethylated in these clinical samples
(data not shown).
Finally, we investigated the potential relationship between
clinical response and p53R2 induction in the 15 MDS/AML
patients under study. Clinical responses included marrow complete
remission and partial remission in one patient each and stable
disease in six patients (Table 2). Strikingly, 7 of 8 patients (88%)
showing a clinical response displayed p53R2 mRNA induction,

whereas 0 of 5 (0%) nonresponding patients displayed p53R2
mRNA induction, a difference that was highly significant (Fisher’s
exact test, P = 0.0047; Table 2). In addition, 4 of 5 (80%) patients
showing a clinical response displayed p53R2 protein induction,
whereas 2 of 4 (50%) nonresponding patients displayed p53R2
protein induction, which was not significant (Fisher’s exact test,
P = 0.5238). Taken together, these data reveal that p53R2 mRNA
induction is associated with clinical responses to decitabine.

Discussion
We have identified and characterized p53R2 as a novel
decitabine gene target in human cancer. p53R2 activation links
decitabine activity to p53-mediated DNA damage responses, as its
induction is p53 dependent. This distinguishes p53R2 from p21/
CDKN1A, which we have previously shown is induced by decitabine
treatment by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms (15). p53R2 induction may thus be an appropriate pharmacodynamic marker for p53 activation by decitabine in vivo. In
MDS, p53 mutations are infrequent, ranging from 6% to 14% in
adult MDS patients (17–19). Thus, activation of p53R2 and other
p53 target genes may be important in mediating therapeutic
responses in this setting, consistent with the data presented here.
This hypothesis is also supported by our finding that p53R2
contributes to growth arrest in vitro in tumor cells responding to
decitabine treatment. Given the complex nature of cellular gene
expression changes following decitabine treatment (34), it is
remarkable that specific knockdown of p53R2 significantly alters
decitabine-mediated growth arrest and suggests that this protein
may play a key role in decitabine responses in tumors in which
wild-type p53 is retained.
Decitabine treatment induces p53R2 expression in vivo and its
induction correlates with clinical response in MDS/AML. It is
unclear whether p53R2 directly contributes to the therapeutic
effect of decitabine or alternatively whether its induction is a
surrogate marker for p53 activation, which may contribute to the
therapeutic response by a diverse set of mechanisms. Our
observation that p53R2 mRNA but not p53R2 protein induction
correlates with clinical response seems to support the latter model;
however, analysis of a greater number of patient samples is
required to adequately address this question. If p53R2 contributes

to therapeutic responses, we hypothesize that it may do so by
promoting tumor cell differentiation, a long-established effect of
DNMT inhibitors (46). p53R2, by catalyzing dNTP formation
required for DNA repair in growth-arrested cells, may allow for
enhanced cell survival in the face of genomic DNA hypomethylation. This could in turn promote cellular differentiation by allowing
the reexpression of epigenetically silenced genes in surviving
hypomethylated cells.
p53R2 is not induced by genomic DNA hypomethylation
mediated by genetic knockdown of DNMT1; furthermore, the 5¶
CpG island of p53R2 does not display methylation changes during
its activation by decitabine either in cell lines or in vivo. Moreover,
etoposide treatment induces p53R2, suggesting that p53R2 is not
silenced by DNA methylation in these cancer cell lines, even at
potentially cryptic regulatory sites. Taken together, these data
unlink DNA hypomethylation from p53R2 induction. Instead, we
hypothesize that covalent adduct formation between decitabineincorporated DNA molecules and DNMT enzymes leads to p53R2
induction. Supporting this model, dose response experiments
revealed a tight correlation between the loss of soluble DNMT1

from nuclear extracts and the induction of p53R2 following
decitabine treatment. In addition, two other DNMT inhibitors that
form covalent adducts, 5-azacytidine and zebularine, also induce
p53R2 expression whereas RG108, which does not form covalent
adducts, does not. Despite these data, it is possible that p53R2 is
silenced by DNA hypermethylation in certain tumors, although this
has yet to been reported. More generally, the fact that p53R2
induction in vivo seems to be independent of promoter DNA
hypomethylation emphasizes the role of hypomethylation-independent gene activation in the activity of decitabine in myeloid
malignancies. Additional support for the role of hypomethylationindependent effects comes from an earlier study that found that
the majority of decitabine-activated genes in MDS/AML do not
show induced promoter DNA hypomethylation following drug
treatment (47).
p53R2 is a homologue of the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide
reductase that pairs with the catalytic R1 subunit to form a
competent enzyme complex in nonproliferative cells (48). In
addition to its function in nuclear DNA repair, p53R2 has recently
been shown to provide dNTPs for mtDNA replication (49, 50).

Interestingly, p53R2 gene mutations were identified in individuals
with severe mtDNA depletion in muscle (49). Based on these data,
it has been suggested that the main function of p53R2 may not be
to mediate nuclear DNA repair but rather for mtDNA synthesis
(48). Thus, it is of interest to determine whether decitabine
treatment alters mtDNA function and whether this could affect
cellular responses to DNMT inhibitors.
The original reports on p53R2 used overexpression studies to
show that p53R2-induced cell cycle arrest via a G2 phase block
(26, 27). In agreement, our overexpression studies indicate that
p53R2 induces G2 arrest in RKO cells (data not shown). However,
our siRNA knockdown studies revealed that p53R2 primarily
contributes to decitabine-mediated growth arrest by mediating a
G1 phase block. Consistent with this observation, it was recently
shown that p53R2 contributes to G1 arrest in UV-irradiated cells by
disassociating from a direct interaction with p21 and facilitating the
accumulation of nuclear p21 (51). It is currently unknown whether
p53R2/p21 interactions are involved in cellular growth arrest in
response to decitabine; however, it is clear from our data that
overexpression studies may not accurately predict the functional
role of endogenous p53R2 in mediating cell growth arrest.
In summary, we report that p53R2, a ribonucleotide reductase
gene linked to p53-dependent DNA repair, is a robust gene target

p53R2 functionally contributes to cellular responses to decitabine
and that its induction directly correlates with clinical responses in
MDS/AML. These data open up a number of new lines of
investigation relevant for understanding the molecular pharmacology of decitabine and other epigenetic therapies as treatments
