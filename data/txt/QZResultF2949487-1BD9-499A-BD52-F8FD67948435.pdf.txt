BACKGROUND: Opioids may alter immune function, thereby potentially affecting cancer recurrence. The authors investigated the
association between postdiagnosis opioid use and breast cancer recurrence. METHODS: Patients with incident, early stage breast
cancer who were diagnosed during 1996 through 2008 in Denmark were identified from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group
Registry. Opioid prescriptions were ascertained from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Follow-up began on the date of primary surgery for breast cancer and continued until breast cancer recurrence, death, emigration, 10 years, or July 31, 2013, whichever
occurred first. Cox regression models were used to compute hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals associating breast cancer recurrence with opioid prescription use overall and by opioid type and strength, immunosuppressive effect, chronic use (6 months of
continuous exposure), and cumulative morphine-equivalent dose, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: In total, 34,188 patients were
identified who, together, contributed 283,666 person-years of follow-up. There was no association between ever-use of opioids and
breast cancer recurrence (crude hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.1; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.1), regardless of opioid type, strength, chronicity of use, or cumulative dose. Breast cancer recurrence rates were lower
among users of strongly (but not weakly) immunosuppressive opioids, possibly because of channeling bias among those with a high
competing risk, because mortality was higher among users of this drug type. CONCLUSIONS: This large, prospective cohort study
provided no clinically relevant evidence of an association between opioid prescriptions and breast cancer recurrence. The current
findings are important to cancer survivorship, because opioids are frequently used to manage pain associated with comorbid condiC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Opioids are frequently and increasingly used as analgesics for treating moderate to severe pain in patients with malignant
and nonmalignant conditions.1,2 Opioids inhibit cell-mediated immunity—a principal defense against cancer.3 Laboratory studies suggest that opioids induce tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis, cell cycle progression, migration, and
metastasis.3,4 These mechanisms may increase the rate of cancer recurrence. However, some in vitro studies have demonstrated that morphine and other opioids prevent angiogenesis, inhibit matrix metalloproteinase expression,3 and promote
apoptosis, albeit at high doses that may not be relevant for clinical practice.4 Murine breast cancer models have indicated
that morphine does not affect tumorigenesis but does appear to promote the growth of existing tumors.5 Methylnaltrexone, a l-opioid receptor antagonist used to treat opioid side effects, inhibits the growth of lung carcinoma and lung metastasis.6 This evidence suggests that opioids may modify cancer progression, although whether the balance of effects favors
increased or decreased recurrence risk remains unclear.
Studies of opioids and cancer progression in humans almost exclusively have evaluated the effect of opioid-based anesthesia on cancer survival.7-11 During the perioperative period, opioids may be administered in high doses, and tumor

cells may have a higher risk of disseminating into the general circulation.4,12 Some studies,9-11 but not all,7,8 indicate poorer survival among patients who received general
anesthesia with morphine compared with those who
received regional anesthesia (ie, local, paravertebral, or epidural). A l-opioid receptor gene polymorphism, which
diminishes response to opioids, has been correlated with
better survival in breast cancer patients,13 and high lopioid receptor expression has been correlated with
poorer survival in prostate cancer.14 A study based on 99
patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer demonstrated a
higher 5-year recurrence rate among patients who received
opioids in the first 96 hours postsurgery.15
Any role of opioids in cancer progression would
have important clinical implications for pain management
of patients with cancer or comorbid conditions.16 The
potential for such pain management to exacerbate malignant disease requires clarification. Therefore, we measured the association between use of prescribed opioids
and breast cancer recurrence in a large Danish
population-based study of breast cancer survivors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Danish Data Protection
Agency (record 2012-41-0793), the Danish Medicines
Agency, and the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative
Group (DBCG).
Source Population and Data Collection

This cohort study included all women residing in Denmark who were diagnosed with incident, invasive breast
cancer between 1996 and 2008 and whose diagnosis was
registered with the DBCG. The DBCG has captured
most cases of invasive breast cancer since its establishment
in 1976, with completeness of registration increasing over
time from 87% in 1986 to 96% in 1997.17 The DBCG
obtains prospective, prespecified data on tumor, treatment, and patient characteristics from treating physicians.
Patients with operable breast cancer registered in the
DBCG undergo semiannual follow-up examinations for
the first 5 years after diagnosis and annual examinations
for the next 5 years. Follow-up examinations include a
physical and, if indicated, a chest x-ray, bone scan, or
other diagnostic procedure to detect recurrent disease.18
Patients who develop recurrent disease between follow-up
examinations are also reported to the DBCG. From the
DBCG, we retrieved surgery date; age at diagnosis; menopausal status at diagnosis; disease stage based on World
Health Organization histologic tumor type and lymph
node status; histologic grade; tumor estrogen receptor
3508

(ER) status; type of primary surgery; receipt of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or endocrine therapy (ET); and
date and anatomic site of recurrence. Information on age
at the date of surgery and all-cause mortality was retrieved
from the Danish Civil Registration System.19
The National Prescription Registry maintained by
Statistics Denmark has recorded all prescriptions redeemed
at Danish pharmacies since 1995, including the date dispensed, drug prescribed (according to the Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical classification), and fill quantity.20
Data can be linked among registries using the civil personal
registration number, a unique personal identification number assigned to each Danish citizen by the Danish Civil
Registration System at birth or upon immigration.19 We
used the National Prescription Registry to ascertain information on prescriptions for opioids and potentially confounding coprescriptions, including simvastatin, aspirin,
and hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) (Supporting
Table 1; see online supporting information).
We obtained information on comorbidities from
the Danish National Registry of Patients, which has
recorded data on nonpsychiatric hospital admissions since
1977 and on outpatient hospital contacts since 1995,
including civil personal registration number, dates of
admission and discharge, and up to 20 discharge diagnoses.21 We examined specific comorbid diseases that were
prevalent on the date of breast cancer surgery, including
rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, diabetes, cancer diagnoses other than breast cancer, peripheral and cerebral
vascular disease, myocardial infarction, and congestive
heart failure. The specific International Classification of
Diseases Eighth and Tenth Revision codes used in the
study are listed in Supporting Table 2 (see online supporting information).
Analytic Variables

Age at diagnosis was included as a continuous variable in
multivariable models. Histologic grade was classified as low,
moderate, or high. We defined primary therapy as either
mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy,
chemotherapy as a dichotomous variable, and ER status and
endocrine therapy (ET) as a design variable (ER-positive/
received ET [ER1/ET1], ER1/no ET [ER1ET2], ERnegative/ET2 [ER2/ET2], or ET2/ET1).
Opioid prescriptions were modeled as a timedependent exposure that was updated daily during followup and lagged by 1 year. We chose an initial lag time of 1
year and conducted sensitivity analyses in which the models were lagged by 2 years but observed no change in the
effect estimates. Opioid exposure overall was defined as at

least 1 opioid prescription in the year before exposure
assessment. Thus, a patient was considered exposed to
opioids at a given time when she was prescribed an opioid
>1 year but <2 years before each assessment point. Similarly, prescriptions in the 2 years before diagnosis counted
toward the risk period in the first 2 years after diagnosis.
Opioid exposure was also classified by opioid strength
(prescriptions for weak opioids [tramadol, codeine, dextropropoxyphene], strong opioids [all others], and both
strong and weak opioids), and was modeled again as a
time-varying exposure lagged by 1 year. We also conducted sensitivity analyses changing the definition of
opioid exposure from 1 prescription to 2 prescriptions,
and again, lagging models by 1 and 2 years.
To investigate the potential immunosuppressive
effects of opioids (classified according to their in vitro
immunosuppressive effects),22 the following categories of
opioid exposure were examined: nonuse, exclusive use of
strongly immunosuppressive opioids (codeine, morphine,
fentanyl), exclusive use of weakly immunosuppressive
opioids (oxycodone, tramadol, buprenorphine, hydromorphone), and a single category for a combination of
strong and weak immunosuppressive opioids and other
opioids (ketobemidone, nicomorphine, pethidine, pentazocine, tapentadol, dextropropoxyphene).
Chronic, long-term opioid consumption, incorporating both quantity and duration of opioids exposure,
was defined as filling at least 1 opioid prescription per
month for at least 6 months of the prescribing year.2 Specifically, this was operationalized as 6 or more prescriptions, with 2 of these at least 150 days apart (180 days
apart in a sensitivity analysis), and no 2 consecutive prescriptions more than 37 days apart. We calculated the
morphine-equivalent dose based on morphine-equivalent
fractions as described by Jarlbaek et al.23 The cumulative
morphine-equivalent dose was equal to the product of the
number and dose of tablets (or injections) dispensed and
the morphine-equivalent conversion factors associated
with each prescription’s Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code. These values were aggregated and updated in
each follow-up cycle according to the following categories:
nonuse, 1 to 500 mg (low), 501 to 5000 mg (medium),
and >5000 mg (high).
Potential confounding drugs, including prescriptions for simvastatin and aspirin, which reportedly can
modify breast cancer prognosis,24,25 were defined as timevarying covariates lagged by 1 year. For opioids, exposure
to aspirin and simvastatin was lagged with a moving 1year exposure period. HRT was defined as a baseline
covariate.

Information on breast cancer recurrence was ascertained from the DBCG and defined by the DBCG as
locoregional or distant recurrence or contralateral breast
cancer.17 Follow-up began on the date of breast cancer
primary surgery and continued until the first of recurrence, death, emigration, completion of 10 years of
follow-up, or July 31, 2013. We censored patients at 10
years in accordance with the patients’ active follow-up
program.18
Statistical Analyses

We examined the frequency and proportion of opioid
ever-users and never-users within categories of covariates
(Table 1) and used Cox regression models to estimate
associations with breast cancer recurrence, computed as
hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) (a 5 .05), calculated by the Wald method.
Estimated associations were adjusted for the following
confounders: age, menopausal status, histologic grade,
ER/ET status, disease stage, primary surgery type, chemotherapy, time-varying exposures to simvastatin and aspirin, baseline HRT, and comorbid diseases, as described
above. All time-varying covariates were lagged by 1 year in
the Cox models, both to allow for an induction period
and to avoid the possibility that subclinical recurrence
could affect prescribing patterns. Effect measure modification was evaluated by stratifying analyses on ER/ET status, menopausal status, and surgery type. In addition, Cox
models were used to investigate the effect of cumulative
opioid exposure, chronic long-term opioid exposure, and
the potential immunosuppressive effect of opioids22 on
breast cancer recurrence. Cox models were also used to
investigate the association between the immunosuppressive effect of opioids and all-cause mortality. All analyses
were performed using SAS software (version 9.3; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
This study included 34,188 patients who were diagnosed
with invasive breast cancer between 1996 and 2008
(Table 1). Overall, 47% of patients were ever-users of
opioids, and 5325 patients were diagnosed with a recurrence over a median of 7.1 years of follow-up. Opioid
users were generally older at diagnosis (median age, 61.8
years vs 57.8 years) and were more likely to be postmenopausal. Overall, 20%, 21%, and 31% of the breast cancer
cohort had ever been prescribed aspirin, simvastatin, and
HRT, respectively. Compared with nonopioid users,
opioid users were more likely to be concurrent users of
simvastatin, aspirin, and HRT. A higher proportion of

Values indicate individuals who had a breast cancer recurrence during opioid exposure.
c
In the cumulative-dose model, the number of nonusers appears to be lower than in the other models. This is because, once patients were exposed to
opioids, they could not go back to being unexposed. However, in the other categories, nonusers encompass a mixture of those individuals who were exposed
to opioids but were not exposed to opioids when they developed recurrent disease and those who were never exposed to opioids.
d
Opioids were classified as strongly immunosuppressive (codeine, morphine, fentanyl) or weakly immunosuppressive (buprenorphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, tramadol) according to Sacerdote 2006.22
e
Other opioids included mixed exposure to strongly and weakly immunosuppressive opioids and/or exposure to ketobemidone, pethidine, pentazocine, tapentadol, nicomorphine, or dextropropoxyphene.

opioid users versus nonusers had stage I disease (39% vs
37%), grade 1 tumors (29% vs 26%), and ER1/ET1
disease (54% vs 51%). Opioid users were less likely than
nonusers to receive chemotherapy (26% vs 37%) and
had a higher frequency of comorbid diseases than
nonusers.
Tramadol was the most frequently prescribed
opioid, accounting for 36% of all opioid prescriptions.
Codeine accounted for 23% of prescriptions (Supporting
Table 3; see online supporting information). Oxycodone,
ketobemidone, and morphine were the most frequently
prescribed strong opioids (11%, 10%, and 9% of all
opioid prescriptions, respectively).
Among the 5325 patients who developed recurrent
disease, 1693 (32%) had ever used opioids. Compared
with nonuse, the use of opioids was not associated with

was lagged by 2 years (Supporting Table 4; see online supporting information). There was also no association

HRs were adjusted for age at diagnosis (as a continuous variable), menopausal status at diagnosis (premenopausal or postmenopausal), disease stage (I, II,
or III), histologic grade (low, moderate, or high), surgery type and radiotherapy receipt (mastectomy, breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy), ER status
and ET receipt (ER1/ET2, ER1/ET2, ER2/ET2, ER2/ET1), receipt of chemotherapy (yes/no), postdiagnostic simvastatin use and postdiagnostic aspirin use

and congestive heart failure (yes/no), peripheral and cerebrovascular disease (yes/no), malignant disease (yes/no), diabetes mellitus (yes/no), rheumatoid arthritis (yes/no), and osteoarthritis (yes/no).

In contrast, the use of assumed strongly immunosuppressive opioids was correlated with a decreased rate of
breast cancer recurrence (HRadjusted, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.570.99), whereas the use of weakly immunosuppressive
opioids or other/both types of opioids had no association
with breast cancer recurrence (Table 3). However, we
observed a 4-fold increase in the rate of all-cause mortality
associated with the use of strongly immunosuppressive
opioids (Supporting Table 5; see online supporting information). Finally, there was no evidence of effect modification in models stratified by ER/ET status, menopausal
status, surgery type, or chemotherapy receipt (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
The current study produced no evidence of an association
between postdiagnosis opioid prescriptions and breast
cancer recurrence. The effect estimates did not differ
according to opioid strength, cumulative dose, or chronic
long-term exposure or in analyses stratified by ER/ET status, menopausal status, and surgery type. Although we
observed a decreased rate of recurrence associated with the
use of strongly immunosuppressive opioids, such exposure was correlated with an increased rate of all-cause mortality in our population, consistent with previous reports.2
Therefore, the apparent effect of these opioids on recurrence may be attributable to channeling bias, in which the
3512

individuals with a high competing risk for mortality are
those prescribed strong opioids.26 In these patients, symptoms of recurrent disease may be masked by the opioids or
may be misattributed to comorbid diseases.
Several issues should be considered when interpreting our results. The large size and population-based
design of our study, in a country with universal taxsupported health care, minimized the potential for selection bias. The DBCG manages a breast cancer clinical
database that is considered one of the most comprehensive
in the world, with data quality comparable to that of a
clinical trial.17 The use of a prospective, population-based
prescription registry eliminated the potential for recall
bias. With the exception of HRT, we characterized prescribed opioids and comedications as time-varying exposures, which allowed for fluctuations in drug exposure
during follow-up. We note that >99% of aspirin exposure
in the current study was for low-dose aspirin prescriptions. Low-dose aspirin is almost exclusively prescribed
for cardiovascular disease prophylaxis/prevention.
Patients pay a proportion of the cost of their prescriptions,
and aspirin is reimbursable through the Danish national
health insurance system,27 so it seems likely that our estimates for aspirin, as well as those for the other confounder
drugs (HRT and simvastatin), reflect actual use. We
lagged the opioid and confounder drug exposures by 1

year and conducted sensitivity analyses lagging opioid exposure by 2 years to allow for a latency period between
opioid exposure and breast cancer recurrence and to minimize any potential reverse causation.
A potential concern is the possible misclassification
of opioid exposure because of nonprescription opioid use.
Opioids are legally available only by prescription in Denmark. Although we could not assess the possible use of
diverted opioid medications among cohort members, we
do not expect a high prevalence of illegal drug use among
patients with breast cancer. Prescription compliance is
also a concern. We assessed drug exposure based on
redeemed prescriptions, for which patients had to pay a
proportion of the costs. Therefore, our estimates are likely
to reflect actual use. Although we had no data on the specific indication for an opioid prescription or the severity
of the pain experienced, we observed no overall change in
effect estimates when we adjusted our analyses for specific
comorbid conditions.
Other types of opioid exposure misclassification are
also possible. We had no information on in-hospital or
perioperative opioid use, which, as noted above, may
influence cancer survival.7,9-11,28 However, its effect on
recurrence may be negligible, because the length of hospital stay is short for patients with breast cancer in Denmark.29 We also lacked a measure of endogenous opioids,
such as b-endorphin, which is induced by physiologic
stress and may have antineoplastic properties.12 bEndorphin expression may vary particularly around the
time of breast cancer surgery because of the physiologic
stress of surgery. Taken together, unmeasured effects of
anesthesia and endogenous opioids may work in concert
with prescribed exogenous opioids to alter the risk of cancer recurrence.
Our results are at odds with findings from some
published studies, which have reported survival differences according to methods of opioid-mediated anesthesia
and analgesia in cancer patients.9,10 Experimental research
suggests that extended exposure to high opioid concentrations may suppress tumor growth, whereas clinically relevant use of opioids may promote cancer growth.30
Accordingly, our null findings may reflect the evidently
paradoxical effects of opioids on cancer cell growth, with
growth-promoting effects negated by growth-inhibitory
effects. In this study, we sought to address the potential
self-neutralizing effect of opioids on breast cancer recurrence by lagging and continuously updating our drug exposure definitions, by distinguishing between the strong
and weak opioids, by assessing the cumulative morphineequivalent dose and the immunosuppressive effects of
Cancer

opioids, and by evaluating the effect of chronic, long-term
opioid exposure.
This large study, which included more than 34,000
patients with breast cancer, extends current knowledge by
providing new evidence on the effect of routine opioid use
in breast cancer patients after hospital discharge.2 This
evidence is particularly important given the increasing
prevalence of opioid consumption in western populations2,23; the increasing incidence of breast cancer; and,
consequently, the increasing numbers of individuals faced
with decisions regarding treatment for pain related to
their cancer or comorbid conditions. Because the setting
of our study was a nonmetastatic cancer population, our
findings are important to cancer survivorship settings, as
opioids are frequently used to manage pain associated
with comorbid conditions. In conclusion, the findings
from our large clinical population-based study provide no
evidence of an association between prescribed opioids and
breast cancer recurrence.
