ABSTRACT
Resistance to cisplatin is a major challenge in the current cancer therapy. In
order to explore new therapeutic strategies to cisplatin resistance, we evaluated,
in a model of lung cancer (H1299 and H460 cell lines), the nature of the pathways
leading to cell death. We observed that H1299 displayed a natural resistance to
cisplatin due to an inability to trigger an apoptotic response that correlates with
the induction of autophagy. However, pharmacological and genetic approaches
showed how autophagy was a mechanism associated to cell death rather than to
resistance. Indeed, pro-autophagic stimuli such as mTOR or Akt inhibition mediate
cell death in both cell lines to a similar extent. We next evaluated the response to
a novel platinum compound, monoplatin, able to promote cell death in an exclusive
autophagy-dependent manner. In this case, no differences were observed between
both cell lines. Furthermore, in response to monoplatin, two molecular hallmarks
of cisplatin response (p53 and MAPKs) were not implicated, indicating the ability
of this pro-autophagic compound to overcome cisplatin resistance. In summary,
our data highlight how induction of autophagy could be used in cisplatin resistant
tumours and an alternative treatment for p53 mutated patient in a synthetic lethally
approach.

INTRODUCTION

detected between cell lines. Indeed, a novel platinumbased compound monoplatin (MonoPt), which specifically
promotes autophagy, was able to kill CDDP-resistant
and sensitive cells in a similar fashion. This effect was
independent of key players of the cellular response to CDDP
such as p53 or MAPKs. Therefore, our results suggest that
a synthetic lethality approach based on autophagy could
open a new therapeutic window for tumours with a deficient
response to apoptotic stimuli like CDDP.

Cisplatin (CDDP) is one of the most widely used
drugs in cancer therapy. [1] Its mechanism of action has
been deeply investigated, being the DNA molecules the
main target of this drug. [2, 3] Since early 90’s, it is known
that apoptosis is the main mechanism by which CDDP
exerts its cytotoxic effect [4] (For an excellent review,
see ref. [5]). Nonetheless, resistance to this drug is still
a major challenge in cancer therapy due to its wide use
in the treatment of different types of tumours as well as
its use in combination with other therapies. [1] Therefore,
the search of new therapeutic alternatives to solve this
problem will have an impact in the daily clinical practice.
In this regard, novel molecules based on platinum are
currently developed and, some of them, under clinical
investigation like satraplatin, which is known to promote
apoptosis to execute its therapeutic effect. [6] Furthermore,
it has been proposed the use of novel targets for CDDP,
like mitochondrial DNA, to overcome CDDP resistance
rendering compounds like Platin-M which is able to
promote an apoptotic response. [7]
Autophagy is the main mechanism for recycling
cellular components. The most commonly studied type of
autophagy is macroautophagy and there is already a vast
knowledge about its molecular machinery (For a review,
see ref. [8]). Recently, a growing body of evidences is
implicating autophagy in cancer and its therapy. [9] There
are several ways of how autophagy is related to cancer
therapy. On the one hand, compounds able to trigger this
biological response are considered novel and promising
therapeutic approaches, being the mTOR inhibitors the
best example (For a review, see ref. [10]). On the other
hand, there are numerous examples of how autophagy is
related to a resistant response as in the case 5-Fluorouracil,
Doxorrubicin or ionizing radiation among others. [11–13]
Even, in response to non DNA-damaging agents like Tyrkinase inhibitors (vg. Sorafenib), it has been observed
the induction of autophagy, [14, 15] indicating the broad
implication of this process in cancer therapy. In this sense,
it is noteworthy how compounds able to block autophagy
are considered therapeutic agents, especially in combination
with DNA damaging agents, as in the case of chloroquine,
but with side effects that should be considered in future
therapies. [16] In summary, the role of autophagy in cancer
therapy seems to be dual, with implications either in
sensitivity and in resistance depending on the system and
the therapeutic agent used. [17, 18]
In this context, we decided to study the basis of
CDDP resistance in an experimental model of lung cancer.
Our data indicate that resistance to CDDP is due to the lack
of a functional apoptotic response. However, this resistance
correlates with the appearance of autophagy, which seems
to be a mechanism of cell death poorly triggered by CDDP.
Interestingly, in response of pro-autophagic compounds
such as mTOR or Akt inhibitors, no differences were

RESULTS
Resistance to CDDP correlates with lack of
apoptosis
To gain further insight into the basis of CDDP
resistance in lung cancer we used H1299 and H460 cells.
First, we performed a dose-response assay to CDDP
in both cell lines. As expected, H1299 showed a great
resistance by crystal violet method as well as by MTT
(Figure 1A and 1B), in agreement with previous reports
[19]. Considering that apoptosis is the main mechanism
for cell death associated to CDDP we evaluated it by
different methods in both experimental models. While
H460 cells displayed a consistent induction of apoptosis
by means of flow cytometry assays (Figure 1C and 1D),
western blotting and caspase enzymatic activity (Figure 1E
and 1F), no effect was observed in H1299 cells (Figures
1C, 1D, 1E, 1F). In the case of H460, no activation on
caspase 8 was observed (data not shown) thus leading
us to conclude that apoptosis was triggered through the
extrinsic pathway. To fully prove our observations, we
challenged a pan-caspase inhibitor like Q-VD-OPh
(Q-VD). [20] Q-VD was able to promote a decrease in
the apoptotic response in H460 cells that correlates with
an increase in their viability. Interestingly, the same
compound did not modify the response in H1299 (Figures
1G and 1H). Furthermore, another DNA-damaging agent
such as ionizing radiation, known to promote apoptosis,
was challenged in this experimental system showing again
a correlation between resistance and lack of apoptosis
(Supplementary Figure S1). In summary, this set of
experiments demonstrate that the lack of apoptosis is a
key mechanism in the resistance observed in H1299 cells.
To fully understand CDDP resistance associated
to H1299 cells we decided to analyse several anti- and
pro-apoptotic proteins. As it is shown (Figure 2A),
among the anti-apoptotic, Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-xL
and Bcl-w showed a slight upregulation in H1299 cells
while a marked downregulation was observed for Bcl-2.
In the case of pro-apototic, BH3-only proteins, Noxa and
Bax showed a marked downmodulation in H1299 cells,
in agreement with a previous report that connects these
proteins to CDDP response. [21] Indeed, the use of a
BH3-mimetic compound such as ABT263, [22] showed
no effect onto H460 cells, while in H1299, it was able to

promote a discrete effect onto the apoptotic response with
almost no effect on viability (Figures 2B and 2C). These
last data suggest that a deregulated pattern in pro- and
anti-apoptotic proteins could be a mechanism to partially
explain the resistant phenotype observed in H1299 cells.
However, it should coexist with other mechanisms to fully
explain the acute resistance of these cells.

our experimental model by evaluating lipidation of LC3
and degradation of p62/SQTSM1 following standard
procedures. [26] As it is shown, H1299 cells showed an
increase in the lipidated form of LC3 (LC3-II) as well
as a decrease of p62/SQSTM1 in response to CDDP,
which were not observed in H460 cells (Figure 3A). In
fact, transfection of GFP-LC3 in H1299 renders a pattern
consistent with the induction of autophagy (Supplementary
Figure 2A). To fully support the role of autophagy in
CDDP resistance, H1299 and H460 cells were incubated
in the presence of a known autophagy inhibitor,
3-methyladenine (3MA), [27] and viability in response to
CDDP was evaluated. As expected (Figure 3B), inhibition
of autophagy by 3MA did not modify the viability of H460

cells. Surprisingly, in H1299 cells we observed an increase
in the resistance (Figure 3C). These data prompted us to
consider that autophagy was a mechanism to explain the
low cell death observed in H1299 cells. Next, we used a
genetic approach to fully establish the role of autophagy
in CDDP resistance. To this end, Atg5 gene, which is key
player in the progression of autophagy, [8] was knockeddown by using shRNA. After achieving an effective
abrogation of ATG5 at the protein level in both cell lines
(Figure 3D), viability was evaluated, showing almost no
effect in H460 cells, while an increase in viability was
observed in H1299 cells (Figures 3E and 3F) correlating
with a lack of autophagy (Supplementary Figure S2B).
Therefore, this set of experiments allows us to
conclude that autophagy is not mediating the observed
resistant phenotype. Furthermore, it suggests that
autophagy is a plausible way to explain the cell death
poorly triggered by CDDP in H1299 cells.

overcome natural resistance to CDDP when apoptotic
response is impaired.

MonoPt-triggered autophagy is p53- and
MAPKs independent
In an attempt to fully validate our strategy, the use
of an autophagy-provoking compound in CDDP-resistant
cells, we challenged the role of two major determinants
of CDDP resistance such as p53 and MAPKs signalling
axis [31].
The role of the tumour suppressor p53 in CDDP
resistance has been well established for more than
20 years. [32] In fact, in our experimental model, a
strict correlation exists between lack of functional p53
and resistance. Therefore, to study the role of p53 in
MonoPt-associated autophagy, we took advantage of the
availability of the experimental model of HCT116 cells
with both p53 alleles disrupted [33] (Figure 6A). Next,
cells were exposed to CDDP or MonoPt and viability
was evaluated. As expected, p53-null cells showed a
clear resistance compared to p53-wt cells in response to
CDDP (Figure 6B). However, in the case of MonoPt, the
differences were undetectable (Figure 6C). Furthermore,
apoptosis was analysed, showing a nice correlation
with sensitivity to CDDP, while for MonoPt no effect
was observed as judged by caspase 3/7 activity (Figure
6D). However, a marked induction of autophagy was
observed in both experimental systems (Figure 6E). This
set of experiments indicates that autophagy associated to
MonoPt is independent of p53 activity, and could be a
therapeutic alternative for patients with alterations in this
tumour suppressor.
Next, MAPKs were challenged in response to
MonoPt. Among the several members of this family, we
decided to focus onto p38 and ERK1/2, which have been
shown to be implicated in the response to CDDP. [34,
35] As it is shown in Figure 7A, H460 cells displayed
a marked increase in the activation of p38 MAPK in
response to MonoPt, while in the case of H1299, it almost
remains unaffected, with exactly the same pattern than
in response to CDDP (data not shown and ref. [19]).
Therefore, to fully evaluate the role of this particular
MAPK we used a specific inhibitor for all p38MAPK
isoforms, such as BIRB796, [36] suggesting no role for
this signalling pathway in response to MonoPt (Figure
7B). Regarding to ERK1/2, both cell lines showed a
marked increase in the activation of this MAPK (Figure
7A). However, inhibition of this signalling pathway by
means of U0126, [37] only promotes resistance in H460,
correlating with the blockade of autophagy, with no effect
onto H1299 (Figures 7B, and 7D). In summary, this set of
experiments demonstrates a lack of implication for p38
MAPK in the response to MonoPt and suggests that the
effect of ERK1/2 seems to be cell-type specific, indicating
that this signalling pathway can be excluded as universal
mediator for the therapeutic effect of MonoPt.

H1299 do not display resistance to compounds
that promote autophagy
In light of our previous results, we considered
the possibility of exploiting autophagy as a therapeutic
mechanism in our experimental model of CDDP-resistant
cells. A growing body of evidences is supporting the
PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis as a potent therapy target in several
types of cancers including lung cancer. [28] Hence, we
challenged a potent promoter of autophagy such as
rapamycin. As expected, both cell lines showed a marked
induction of autophagy (Figure 4A) and a similar grade
of toxicity in response to rapamicyn (Figure 4B). Next,
treatment with the Akt inhibitor MK2206, known to
promote autophagic cell death [29] was also evaluated. As
it is shown in Figure 4C and 4D, both cell lines showed
the same behaviour in terms of autophagy, Akt inhibition
and viability upon MK2206 treatment. Therefore, these
results indicate that autophagy induction is effective
in both models to a similar extent and no resistance to
autophagy-prone drugs was observed in this experimental
system. In light of these findings we took advantage of
the availability of a novel platinum derivate, monoplatin
(MonoPt) able to promote specifically autophagic cell
death. [30] Then, cells were exposed to MonoPt and
viability was evaluated. As it is shown, H1299 and H460
cells showed similar sensitivity to this platinum compound
as judged by crystal violet method (Figure 5A) or by
MTT (Figure 5B). Next, we confirmed the induction of
autophagy (Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure 3A)
as well as the lack of apoptosis induction (Figure 5D).
In this case, blockade of autophagy promotes a resistant
phenotype in both cell systems by using either 3MA
(Figures 5E and 5F) as well as the interference of Atg5
(Figures 5G and 5H), correlating with an alteration in the
onset of autophagy (Supplementary Figures 3B and 3C).
In summary, our data demonstrate how autophagy
can be used as a novel synthetic lethally approach to

DISCUSSION

models, this conclusion is based on a mere correlation
rather than in a cause-effect demonstration (For example,
refs. [45–49]). In some reports, the effect due to autophagic
alterations seems to be discreet in terms of viability [43,
45, 50, 51] or the evidences presented are based only on
the use of chemical inhibitors such as chloroquine or 3MA
(vg. refs. [52–55]) which have been reported to also act
trough an autophagy-independent mechanism even in
response to CDDP. [56, 57] In addition, other evidences
connecting autophagy and CDDP resistance are based onto
resistant cell lines obtained by co-culturing [47, 50] or
even CDDP plus other drugs. [58] In fact, in this context of
acquired resistance, very different from natural resistance
like in H1299 cells, previous evidences demonstrate how
suppression of autophagy is a mechanism of resistance,
[59] suggesting that autophagy is a potential mechanism
of sensitivity. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that autophagy
has been proposed as the mechanism to induce cell death
in response to CDDP in the absence of key apoptotic
proteins. [60] Therefore, our data demonstrate that when
CDDP is unable to trigger an apoptotic response -the
natural and effective mechanism of cell death associated
to this drug, autophagy, -probably less effective than
apoptosis in response to CDDP- is promoting cell death,
indicating that both process cannot coexist. [25] Thus, our
work excludes autophagy as mechanism of resistance to
CDDP in our model, supporting the idea of a cytotoxic
autophagy. [18, 61]

Several conclusions can be drawn from the present
study. First, the lack of apoptosis is the main mechanism,
at least in our experimental model of lung cancer, for
CDDP resistance. This observation is inferred from
the data obtained in H1299 cells, which were unable to
trigger an apoptotic response. In this sense, promotion of
apoptosis is a possible way to induce chemosensitivity
in CDDP-based therapy. To this end, several approaches
have been considered such as the effective abrogation of
anti-apoptotic proteins, [38] the use of natural compounds,
[39] modulation of specific genes [40] or the use of BH3
mimetic compounds [41, 42] among others. However,
these interesting possibilities do not seem to be applicable
to our current model of H1299 cells, in which, for example
the use of ABT263, a BH3 mimetic, only induces a slight
increase in the apoptotic response of this cell line towards
CDDP with an almost undetectable shift in its sensitivity.
Therefore, our data suggest that, at least in some cases
(vg. H1299 cells), promotion of apoptosis is not a real
therapeutic alternative.
Second, regarding to autophagy, it has been
considered as a mechanism of resistance to CDDP in
several pathologies including ovarian and lung cancer. [24,
43, 44] However, in addition to the data presented here,
there are other evidences that do not support this idea as a
general mechanism. For example, in several experimental

Third, our data support a lack of involvement of
classical mediators of CDDP resistance (vg p53 and
MAPK) in the response to MonoPt. Regarding to p53,
the data obtained in H1299 as well as in HCT116 p53−/−,
support that this approach can also be used in mutant-p53
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumours. This issue is especially important considering that
alterations in p53 (mutation, inactivation, etc.) are common
events in different types cancers (For more information, see
http://p53.free.fr/ and http://p53.bii.a-star.edu.sg/index.php)
and are also major determinants in the therapeutic response

to CDDP. [32, 62, 63] Indeed, other determinants of chemoresistance linked to p53 such as MNK2 and wee-1 [64, 65]
could be overcome by MonoPt due to its p53 independent
mechanism. Regarding to p38 MAPK, previous report did
not detect any activation of p38 MAPK by MonoPt, [30]
however our data show how p38 MAPK is activated with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the same pattern than in response to CDDP (Data not shown
and ref. [19]). In this regard, it is notorious that p38 MAPK,
which has been proposed as a key mediator in the response
to CDDP [19, 35, 66] is not likely to be extrapolated to
MonoPt, probably due to the different cell death mechanism
triggered. Finally, regarding to ERK1/2, previous report

been previously considered (For a review, see ref. [72]).
But, what is more recent, is the concept of autophagy in
synthetic lethality approaches for cancer therapy as in the
case of renal cell carcinoma (For a review, see ref. [73]).
In this sense, our report is the first evidence showing the
potential role of a synthetic lethality approach based on the
use of two biological processes (autophagy and apoptosis)
for platinum-based therapy. This possibility is extremely
interesting in tumours with a compromised apoptotic
response, one of the main mechanisms of resistance to
CDDP, showing a new alternative to the classical approach
based on potentiation of CDDP-associated apoptosis. [74,
75]. Furthermore, considering the tumour heterogeneity
known to be implicated in the therapeutic response, [76]
our approach could overcome this problem as in the case of
clones with different status in key molecules as p53.
In summary, we present a novel therapeutic
approach to target those tumours in which the apoptotic
capability of a given stimulus (CDDP) is not triggered
(vg p53-mutant). In this context, the use of compounds
with a high potential to trigger autophagy (vg. MonoPt)

considered this MAPK as determinant of MonoPt toxicity
[30] in the same sense as in CDDP response. [34, 43] In
our experimental model, we found out that autophagy
triggered by MonoPt can be either ERK1/2 dependent and
independent as it is shown by the use of U0126 in both cell
lines, indicating that ERK1/2 are not universal mediators
of MonoPt-associated autophagy. Therefore, the definitive
role of ERK1/2 in MonoPt response needs to be more
deeply investigated.
Finally, a synthetic lethality approach based on the
balance of autophagy/apoptosis should be considered
as a novel way to overcome chemoresistance to CDDP
(Figure 8). Synthetic lethality means that a combination of
mutations in two genes leads to cell death, while one single
mutation has no effect (For a review, see ref. [67]). This
genetic principle can be extrapolated to several biological
processes including cancer therapy. [68, 69] It is noteworthy,
that previous works proposed synthetic lethality approaches
for platinum-based therapy by using PARP-inhibitors, [70]
or the use of ATR inhibitors in XRCC1 deficient cells. [71]
The idea of autophagy as an agent in cancer therapy has

could induce cell death independently of major molecular
determinants (vg p53, MAPKs). Whether our proposed
mechanism could apply to other types of tumours, the
putative implications in cancer therapy, as well as the
role of the different components of this synthetic lethally
approach, needs to be further investigated.

to follow the reported procedure in our laboratory have
resulted in a mixture of products, containing a platinum
complex with an unprotected -NH2 group due, probably,
to the Boc cleavage. In order to avoid these problems, and
thereby the formation of by-products, the reaction was
carried out at 60 ºC in the presence of two equivalents of
K2CO3, resulting in a new dimeric platinum complex (DiPt) that was obtained as pure in good yield. In a second
step, the hydrolysis of Di-Pt with HCl leads to MonoPt

Survival and viability assays
An initial population of 2·104 cells/well was seeded
in 24-well plates. 24 hours after, media were discarded and
replaced by media containing either drugs, inhibitors or
both of them at the concentrations indicated in each case.
After treatment (48 hours unless otherwise is indicated),
survival or viability were assessed either by crystal violet
method or by MTT respectively. For crystal violet, cells
were washed with PBS and incubated with crystal violet
reactant (C3886, Sigma Aldrich) (10 mg/ml in a distilled
water-0.5% glutaraldehyde solution) for 20 min at room
temperature in mild rocking. The dye was washed in
running water and colorant was recovered with 10%
acetic acid and transferred to transparent 96-well plates
for optical density evaluation at 595 nm. MTT assays
were carried out as follows: MTT reactant (Thiazolyl
Blue Tetrazolium Bromide, M2128, Sigma Aldrich),
at 5mg/ml in a PBS solution, was added to the cells in
a 1:10 ratio (MTT solution:culture medium) and left for
incubation during 1 h at 37ºC. Then, media were discarded
and formazan crystals adhered to the plate bottom were
recovered with DMSO and transferred to a transparent 96well plate for optical density evaluation at 570 nm.

best performing shRNA clone was selected as judged by
western blot against endogenous ATG5.
Lentiviral production and infections were as follows:
HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with pSAXS (helper
plasmid) and pVSV-G (envelope plasmid) lentiviral
vectors along with either pLKO-puro-shATG5 or pLKOpuro empty vector (SHC001, Sigma-Aldrich) plasmids.
Host cells were infected by adding packaging cells’ media
in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene from Sigma-Aldrich
(H9268). 48 hours after infection cells were exposed to
puromycin (ant-pr-1, Invivogene): 2 μg/ml for H460 and 3
μg/ml for H1299 cells, for at least 3 days before any assay.
Infected cells were routinely maintained at the appropriate
concentrations of puromycin.

For caspase activation assays, cells were plated at a
density of 104 cells/well in opaque 96-well plates 24 hours
prior to treatment. 24 hours after treatment, activation of
effector caspases 3 and 7 was evaluated with Promega’s
CaspaseGlo kit (G8090) following manufacturer’s
instructions. Resulting mixtures were quantified after 30
minutes of incubation at room temperature in a Beckton
Dickinson BD 3096 luminometer.
For Annexin V/Propidium Iodide citometry assays,
cells were seeded in 60-mm culture plates for a final
population of 70% confluence. After treatments, cells
were collected by trypsinization at the indicated times,
pelleted and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. A kit form
Immunostep (ANXVF-200T, BB10X-50ML and “PI”) was
used for FITC-AnnexinV and Propidium Iodide staining
following manufacturer’s instructions. Experiments were
checked for fluorescence in both green and red channels
in a MACSQuant Analyzer 10 cytometer from MACS/
Miltenyi Biotec. Dot plot corresponds to data obtained
from a representative experiment out of three. Grouped
column charts are the average of, at least, 3 independent
experiments.

Tranfections
H1299 cells were transfected with pEX-GFPhLC3wt or pEX-GFP-hLC3ΔG120 previously described,
by using Lipofectamine LTX from Invitrogene
(#15338500) following manufacturer’s instructions.
48 hours later, cells were selected by using G-418 from
Sigma-Aldrich (A1720) at 800 μg/ml for at least 10
days. Then, selected pools were treated and analysed as
indicated in Zeiss LSM-710 confocal microscope. Images
were acquired and processed using Zen 2009 Light Edition
software. Images show a representative fields out of 8. The
scale bars represent 25 μm.

Irradiation
Cells were irradiated in a Clinac Low Energy 600C
linear electron accelerator from Varian by the technical
staff of the University Hospital Complex of Albacete
according to the indications described elsewhere. [80] For
dose-response assays, 3·103 cells/well were seeded in 24well plates 24 hours prior to irradiation. Culture medium
was replaced 24 hours after IR and refreshed every 2 days
until the end of the experiment (6 days). Viability was
evaluated by the crystal violet method.

Data analysis
Results are represented as mean ± SEM (Standard
Error of the Mean) of, at least, three independent
experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis
was performed using the Prism 5.00 software (GraphPad)
and Office Excel 2013 (Microsoft). Significance was
determined using a t-test. The statistical significance of
differences is indicated in Figures by asterisks as follows:

Western blotting

*⇒ p < 0.05; **⇒ p < 0.01; and ***⇒ p < 0.001.

Western blot assays were performed following
standard procedures. [26, 80] Briefly, cells were collected
in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl, 1.5
mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS,
0.5% deoxycholic acid, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate) plus
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2
μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF and 0.1 mM Na3VO4) by
using 40 μg of total cell lysates. α-Tubulin was used as a
loading controls. Images show a representative experiment
out of 3 with nearly identical results.
