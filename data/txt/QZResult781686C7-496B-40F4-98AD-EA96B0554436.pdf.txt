ABSTRACT
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an attractive
death ligand in targeted cancer therapy. Many cancer cells are refractory to TRAILinduced cell death and the mechanisms underlying resistance are unclear. The
molecular mechanisms of HCC and gastric cancer cells resistant to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis were explored using molecular biological and immunological methods. In
vivo experiments were conducted to study the effect of interferon stimulated gene
12a (ISG12a) on human liver cancer xenografts in mice. ISG12a decreases in TRAILresistant cancer cells. ISG12a regulates the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL in vitro
and in vivo. MicroRNA-942 (miR-942) is inversely correlated with ISG12a expression
in cancer cells and tissues. Forced expression of miR-942 in TRAIL-sensitive cells
significantly reduces endogenous ISG12a level and changes the TRAIL sensitive
phenotype to a resistant one. Knockdown of miR-942 expression in TRAIL-resistant
cells restores the expression of ISG12a and sensitizes the cells to TRAIL treatment.
AKT control TRAIL resistance of cancer cells through downregulation of ISG12a by
miR-942. Downregulation of ISG12a by miR-942 is needed to maintain the TRAILresistant phenotype of cancer cells and favors cancer cell survival. MiR-942 may
offer a novel drug response marker with important implications in designing new
therapeutics for TRAIL resistant tumors.

INTRODUCTION

mitochondria-independent and mitochondria-dependent
intracellular death signaling pathways [9, 10]. Upon the
binding of TRAIL, DR4 or DR5 oligomerizes and forms a
death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) by recruiting the
adaptor protein FADD together with caspase-8, and FLIP.
Caspase-8 is activated and then it activates downstream
effectors caspase-3 and caspase-7 through both pathways
[11]. For the mitochondria-dependent pathway, caspase8-mediated cleavage of BID leads to oligomerisation of
Bax and Bak, resulting in the release of cytochrome c.
Cytochrome c activates caspase-9. Activated caspase-3
and caspase-7 provoke cellular destruction by cleaving
several hundred cellular proteins including poly ADPribose polymerase (PARP).
Although many human tumor cell lines are sensitive

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and gastric cancer
(GC) are among the most common cancers worldwide [1].
Only a small percentage of patients maintain well response
to current treatments. New therapeutic approaches are
needed for more effective treatment of these cancers.
Sorafenib was recently approved for the treatment of
advanced renal cell carcinoma and liver cancer patients
[2, 3]. However, it can only improve the survival from 7.9
months to 10.7 months for HCC patients [4].
TRAIL selectively induces the death of cancer
cells and spares normal cells, so it is an attractive death
ligand in targeted cancer therapy [5-8]. TRAIL-induced
apoptosis of cancer cells is carried out by activation of

to TRAIL agonist-mediated apoptosis and are being
evaluated in clinic trials [12, 13], many tumors including
HCC and gastric cancer are still resistant to TRAILinduced apoptosis. Inherent tumor resistance may be a
major barrier to effective TRAIL-targeted therapy.
Several mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL have
been proposed in different cell types, including death
receptor mutation, overexpression of antiapoptotic
proteins, and deficiency of BAX [14-17]. No dominant
mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
have been identified. Clear information about the
resistance mechanisms will guide subsequent studies in
patient selection and the development of combination
trails to counter drug resistance.
ISG12a is highly induced by type I IFN in many cell
types [18]. Inhibition of ISG12a expression prevents the
sensitization to etoposide-induced apoptosis [19]. Whether
ISG12a is involved in TRAIL sensitivity is unclear.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a small noncoding
family of 20-25 nucleotides RNAs that play an important
role in the negative regulation of gene expression by basepairing to complementary sites on the targeted mRNAs. It
is necessary to explore whether miRNAs modulate TRAIL
sensitivity in cancer cells.
Here we demonstrate that miR-942 is upregulated
in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells and decreased in
TRAIL-sensitive ones. MiR-942 is inversely correlated
with ISG12a expression in cancer tissues and cells.
AKT control TRAIL resistance of cancer cells through
downregulation of ISG12a by miR-942. Downregulation
of ISG12a by miR-942 is needed to maintain the TRAILresistant phenotype.

TRAIL-induced apoptosis whereas Huh7, HLCZ01 and
BGC-823 cells did not display sensitivity when exposed to
soluble TRAIL (Fig. 1B). PARP was cleaved in LH86 and
HLCZ02 cells with TRAIL treatment (Fig. 1B). GC cell
line HGC-27 was sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
while another GC cell line BGC-823 was resistant to
apoptosis (Fig. 1C). A possible mechanism of different
sensitivity of tested cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
could be due to the variable level of the death receptors
resulting in increased apoptosis signaling in sensitive cells.
However, functional TRAIL receptor isoforms (DR4 and
DR5) had comparable level in TRAIL-sensitive cells
compared to TRAIL-resistant cells (Fig. 1D). Moreover,
all the tested cells had similar expression levels of DcR1
and DcR2 (data not shown).

TRAIL induces ISG12a in sensitive cells and
ISG12a is highly expressed in normal liver tissues
and less invasive liver cancer tissues as compared
with aggressive liver cancer tissues.
The intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are two major
signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis in mammalian
cells [24]. To investigate the possible apoptotic signaling
pathway of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human HCC
and GC cells, we treated LH86, HLCZ02 and HGC27 cells with TRAIL for 4 hours in the presence of
pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK. Z-VAD-FMK
significantly blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HCC
and GC cells, suggesting that TRAIL induces caspasedependent apoptosis in human HCC and GC cells (Fig.
2A). Active form of caspase-9 and released cytochrome c
were observed in sensitive cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that
TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HCC cells was partially in a
mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway.
Although some cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL,
combination of TRAIL with other reagents significantly
potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in resistant cell
lines, indicating that TRAIL-mediated apoptotic pathway
is intact in the resistant cells [25, 26]. So we postulate
that there are other genes differ in sensitive and resistant
cell lines after treatment of TRAIL. To identify differently
regulated genes in response to TRAIL, we profiled gene
expression mediated by TRAIL in Huh7 and LH86 cells.
Interestingly, cohorts of genes induced by TRAIL are
IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) including ISG12a. Our realtime PCR results confirmed that TRAIL induced ISG12a
in LH86, HLCZ02 and HGC-27 cells but had no such
effect in Huh7, HLCZ01 and BGC-823 cells (Fig. 2C).
Moreover, the level of endogenous ISG12a was much
higher in sensitive cells than that in resistant cells (Fig.
2C). To determine the time course of ISG12a expression,
we treated LH86, Huh7, HLCZ01, HLCZ02, HGC-27 and
BGC-823 cells with TRAIL for different time periods, and
real-time PCR was used to quantify the level of ISG12a

RESULTS
The cytotoxic effect of TRAIL on human HCC
and GC cells.
To better understand liver tumor biology, we have
attempted to develop HCC cells using liver tumor tissue
samples. We established a novel HCC cell line HLCZ02.
HLCZ02 cells were derived from grade II differentiated
HCC tissue of a male patient (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
The cells express human liver-specific genes and proteins
albumin and Î±1-antitrypsin (Supplementary Fig. S1B,
S1C).
We examined TRAIL sensitivity of different human
HCC cell lines: LH86, Huh7, HLCZ01, HLCZ02 and GC
cell lines HGC-27 and BGC-823. Cells were exposed to
TRAIL and cell death was tested using DNA ladder assay
and flow cytometry. DNA ladder was apparently found
in TRAIL-treated LH86 and HLCZ02 cells while rare in
Huh7 and HLCZ01 cells (Fig. 1A). Flow cytometry data
showed that LH86, HLCZ02 and HGC-27 cells underwent

highly expressed in sensitive cells compared to that in
resistant cells (Fig. 2C). We wondered if this situation
occurs in vivo. To answer this question, we investigated
ISG12a in liver cancer specimens. ISG12a was highly
expressed in normal liver tissues and less invasive liver
cancer tissues as compared with aggressive liver cancer
tissues (Fig. 2D).

induced higher level of ISG12a in sensitive cells than in
resistant cells (Fig. 2C). To assess the impact of ISG12a
on apoptotic processes in TRAIL-resistant HCC cells, we
delivered the plasmid pcDNA3.1-ISG12a into Huh7 cells.
As expected, overexpression of ISG12a increased TRAILinduced PARP activation as assessed by the appearance
of the cleaved fragments in the cells (Fig. 3A). To further
confirm the effects of ISG12a on apoptotic processes in
TRAIL-resistant cells, we established a TRAIL-resistant
clone of LH86 cells, LH86-TR cells, obtained by in vitro
selection for TRAIL resistance (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Then we transfected pcDNA3.1-ISG12a into LH86-TR
cells and treated the cells with TRAIL. Increased activation
of PARP was observed in resistant cells overexpressing

ISG12a (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Enhanced activation
of PARP was also observed in resistant GC cells BGC823 when the cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1ISG12a (Fig. 3B). To ensure that ISG12a expression was
responsible for sensitizing the cells to the proapoptotic
stimulus TRAIL, we used short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
constructs pSilence-ISG12a shRNA designed to silence
ISG12a in LH86 cells (Fig. 3C). A shRNA plasmid,
encoding a scrambled shRNA sequence that does not lead
to the specific degradation of any known cellular mRNA,
was used as control. Compared with control shRNA,
transfection of ISG12a shRNA caused a corresponding

loss of sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LH86
and HLCZ02 cells (Fig. 3C). These data suggested that
ISG12a regulates the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis in vitro.
To test whether the high sensitivity of cancer
cells for apoptosis induction can be translated in cancer
treatment in vivo, we silenced ISG12a in LH86 or
overexpressed ISG12a in Huh7 cells and implanted these
cells into the right dorsal sides of immunodeficiency NOD/
SCID mice respectively. TRAIL treatment was initiated
10 days afterwards. Silencing ISG12a in TRAIL-sensitive
HCC cells conferred resistance to TRAIL-induced

apoptosis over control tumor (Fig. 3D). Conversely, forced
expression of ISG12a in TRAIL-resistant HCC cells
sensitized the cells to TRAIL treatment (Fig. 3D). These
findings suggested that ISG12a is an important target for
TRAIL resistance and might play an important role in
tumorigenicity of cancer cells.

IFN signaling pathway. To further explore the mechanisms
of ISG12a in TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we examined
the expression of IFN-Î² in TRAIL-treated cancer cells.
Interestingly, TRAIL indeed induced IFN-Î² in sensitive
LH86 cells (Fig. 4A). To investigate whether IFN-Î² was
involved in induction of ISG12a by TRAIL in sensitive
cells, we used specific shRNA to silence IFN-Î±/Î² receptor
(IFNR) and then evaluated the expression of ISG12a.
Surprisingly, specific IFNR shRNA lead to reduction
of endogenous expression of IFNR by 50% while it
had no effect on the induction of ISG12a by TRAIL
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). In consistent with the data,
IFNR shRNA had no effect on the TRAIL sensitivity
of LH86 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The results
indicated that induction of ISG12a by TRAIL in cancer

cells is independent of IFN signaling.
MiRNAs regulate the expression of many cellular
proteins and are differentially expressed in cancer cells
versus normal cells. To determine the mechanisms
implicated in the repression of ISG12a in resistant cells,
we performed a bioinformatics search (Targetscan, Pictar,
RNhybrid) the putative microRNA targeting ISG12a.
Among the candidate targets, 3â²UTR of human ISG12a
contains region that matches the seed sequence of human
miR-942 (Fig. 4B). We predicted that ISG12a is a targeted
gene of miR-942. To validate this hypothesis, we cloned
3â²UTR of ISG12a containing miR-942 binding sites into
downstream of the luciferase open reading frame of pGL3
control vector. The reporter construct pGL3-ISG12aUTR
and pcDNA3.1-miR-942 were used to transfect CHO
cells, which express very low level of endogenous miR942. Increased expression of miR-942 upon transfection

significantly decreased luciferase activity measured as
relative luciferase activity (Fig. 4B). Conversely, when
we performed luciferase assays using a plasmid harboring
ISG12a3â²UTR(Mut), where the binding sites for miR-942
were inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis, we did not
observe inhibitory effect of miR-942 (Fig. 4B). Moreover,
miR-942 is significantly upregulated in TRAIL-resistant
Huh7 and HLCZ01 cells, verse TRAIL-sensitive LH86
and HLCZ02 cells (Fig. 4C). To test whether miR-942
affects ISG12a expression, we examined the effect of
miR-942 forced expression on ISG12a level in LH86 cells.
Overexpression of miR-942 upon transfection markedly
reduced the level of ISG12a compared to LH86 cells
transfected with scrambled pre-miR (Fig. 4D). All the data
suggested that the 3â²UTR of ISG12a is a direct target of
miR-942.

MiR-942 is inversely correlated with ISG12a
expression in cancer tissues

MiR-942 modulates the sensitivity of cancer cells
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by targeting ISG12a

Our data show that ISG12a increases in less
invasive liver cancer tissues and TRAIL-sensitive cells, as
compared with aggressive liver cancer tissues and resistant
cells respectively. MiR-942 is significantly upregulated
in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells, verse sensitive cancer
cells. Furthermore, we found an inverse correlation
between miR-942 expression and ISG12a expression in
cancer cell lines analyzed (Fig. 2C and Fig. 4C). All the
data indicated that high expression of miR-942 might
be one of the mechanisms acting to negatively regulate
ISG12a in cancer cells. We wondered if this regulation
occurs in vivo. To answer this question, we examined the
expression of miR-942 and ISG12a by real-time PCR in
primary liver cancer and gastric cancer tissue samples. Of
the 17 primary liver cancer tissues examined, miR-942 is
inversely correlated with ISG12a expression in 15 liver
cancer tissues (Fig. 5A). Moreover, miR-942 is inversely
correlated with ISG12a expression in 23 of 28 gastric
cancer tissues (Fig. 5B). The pearson correlation indicated
that an inverse relation between miR-942 and ISG12a in
cancer tissues exists. The data further support the finding
that ISG12a may be a target of miR-942 in vivo.

To examine the effect of miR-942 forced expression
on the expression of ISG12a and TRAIL sensitivity in
cancer cells, we delivered pcDNA3.1-miR-942 into LH86
or HLCZ02 cells. Interestingly, forced expression of
miR-942 in LH86 or HLCZ02 cells significantly reduced
the endogenous level of ISG12a (Fig. 6A) and changed
the TRAIL sensitive phenotype to a resistant one, as the
activation of PARP evidenced by appearance of cleaved
PARP fragment was impaired (Fig. 6B). Conversely,
knockdown of miR-942 expression by anti-miR-942
in Huh7 cells, which was confirmed by real-time PCR,
restored the expression of ISG12a in resistant cells (Fig.
6C) and sensitized the cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 6D). To further corroborate the negative regulation
of miR-942 on TRAIL sensitivity in cancer cells, we
delivered pcDNA3.1-miR-942 into HGC-27 cells. Forced
expression of miR-942 in sensitive gastric cancer cell
HGC-27 significantly reduced the endogenous level of
ISG12a and changed the TRAIL sensitive phenotype to
a resistant one (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Conversely,
knockdown of miR-942 expression by anti-miR-942
restored the expression of ISG12a in resistant BGC-823

miR-942 and ISG12a for 17 subjects in liver cancer tissues or for 28 subjects in gastric cancer tissues was calculated statistically using
the Pearson correlation coefficient and the respective p value, 15 of 17 liver cancer tissues or 23 of 28 gastric cancer tissues significant at

together, these data suggested that miR-942 modulates

regulated via an AKT-dependent pathway [29]. We
postulate that AKT may regulate miR-942 expression.
When we used AKT inhibitor to block AKT activation,
miR-942 was downregulated and ISG12a was upregulated
(Supplementary Fig. S5A-C). To further investigate
whether miR-942 is regulated by AKT, we silenced AKT
in Huh7 cells. First, after AKT knockdown, miR-942
expression was downregulated (Fig. 7B). AKT knockdown
was confirmed (Fig. 7C). Second, by immunostaining, we
observed increased ISG12a expression levels after AKT
downregulation (Fig. 7C). Meanwhile, downregulation of
AKT leads to restoration of the TRAIL-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 7C). Overexpression of miR-942 or silencing ISG12a
reversed TRAIL-induced apoptosis by AKT knockdown
(Supplementary Fig.S6). These data collectively suggested
that AKT controls TRAIL resistance of cancer cells
through downregulation of ISG12a by miR-942.
To elucidate the direct involvement of AKT on miR942 expression levels, we analyzed the upstream sequence
of miR-942 with the Promoter.2 prediction server. We
found two DNA fragments containing the putative

observed in many types of cancers, including gastric
and liver cancer [27, 28]. AKT activation was observed
in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells compared with sensitive

of other survival factors including such as mTOR,
CFLAR(FLIP) and Bcl2 , pro-apoptotic factor such
as BAX, tumor suppressor PTEN and p38 in TRAILsensitive and resistant cancer cells (Fig. 7A). Furthermore,

+1~-2000nt). The two regions were amplified and cloned
into pGL3basic. The luciferase assay showed that both
sequences increased luciferase activity compared with the
vector suggesting that both regions could be the promoter
of miR-942 (Fig. 7D). To confirm that the two regulatory
regions were regulated by AKT, we knocked down AKT
by using siRNA and found decreased luciferase activity
after two reporter constructs overexpression (Fig. 7E).
These results indicated that miR-942 promoting sequences
are regulated by AKT.

is poor. One of the important factors affecting survival rate
is resistance to therapeutic agents. Owing to its specific
toxicity for cancer cells, recombinant TRAIL is among
the most promising apoptosis-based antitumor agents.
Therapy based on TRAIL is now in phase 2 clinical trial
in different types of cancers. However, many cancer cells
remain resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and the
mechanism of such resistance is unclear.
To identify specific signatures as potential
therapeutic targets for TRAIL-resistant phenotype in
human cancer, we analyzed the gene expression profile in
TRIAIL-sensitive cancer cells verse resistant cancer cells.

as ovarian carcinoma, sclerosing basal cell carcinoma and

cancer tissues compared with adjacent nontumorous
tissues and it was consistently highly expressed in
sensitive cells compared to that in resistant cells. These
findings indicated that ISG12a may play roles in different
tissues. Consistent with the recently suggested proapoptotic role of ISG12a [19, 31], our results showed
that force expression of ISG12a in TRAIL-resistant cells
restored the sensitivity in resistant cells and repression of
ISG12a is implicated in causing TRAIL resistance.
MiRNAs are attractive potential drug targets since
they regulate many cellular proteins and are differentially
expressed in malignant cells. They may modulate
TRAIL-induced apoptosis pathway. A recent study
showed that miR-221&222 overexpresses in aggressive
hepatocarcinoma cells regulate TRAIL resistance and
enhance tumorigenicity through PTEN and TIMP3
downregulation [32]. MiR-494 modulates TRAILinduced apoptosis through BIM down-regulation and is
regulated by ERK1/2 [33]. Our data demonstrated that
miR-942 is significantly upregulated in TRAIL-resistant
cells or aggressive cancer tissues, verse TRAIL-sensitive
cells or less invasive cancer tissue, clearly indicating
that miR-942 overexpression is a prerequisite of TRAILresistant HCC and gastric cancer cells. In vitro and in
vivo experiments revealed that elevated level of miR942 in TRAIL-resistant cells or aggressive cancer tissues
correlates with ISG12a downregulation, suggesting that
miR-942 might be a causal factor in the downregulation of
ISG12a in cancers. In the current study, the data indicated
that miR-942 modulates TRAIL sensitivity in cancer cells
mainly by targeting ISG12a. However, it seems plausible
that silencing of other targets of miR-942 contributes to
TRAIL resistance in cancer cells. MiR-942 may offer a
novel TRAIL response marker for cancer patient selection
and personalized medicine with important implications in
designing new therapeutics for TRAIL resistant tumors.
ISG12a is an important antiviral factor and sensitizes
cells to apoptotic stimuli [34]. One recent study implicates
ISG12a as a contributing regulator of IFN-induced
apoptosis, which in turn augment or support the antiviral
activities of type I IFN [25]. Our data demonstrated that
induction of ISG12a in cancer cells does not require IFN
feedback although TRAIL induces IFN-Î² and ISG12a.
Downregulation of ISG12a by miR-942 is needed to
maintain the TRAIL-resistant phenotype of cancer cells
and favors cancer cell survival, which might be the cell
defense response to external harmful stimulation.
PI3K/AKT pathway is a major cell survival
pathway, playing a key role in the development of multiple
drug resistance, such as TRAIL [35]. There are some
miRNAs which confer metastatic potentials in HCC cells
or inhibit tumor growth regulated through PI3K/AKT
pathway [36, 37]. We found that decreased expression
level of miR-942 correlates with AKT knockdown and
ISG12a expression is restored after AKT downregulation.
Our data suggested that AKT controls TRAIL resistance of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer cells through downregulation of ISG12a by miR942. Based on our findings, TRAIL combination with
AKT inhibitors may be used to counter drug resistance
for cancer treatment. Taken together, all the data indicate
that the intracellular miR-942 may modulate sensitivity
of cancer cells to TRAIL through targeting ISG12a with
important implications in the design of new therapeutic
agents.

primers 5â²-TGCCATGGGCTTCACTGCGG-3â²
5â²-CTGCCCGAGGCAACTCCACC-3â².

For construction of the expression plasmid
for ISG12a, the entire open reading frame of human
ISG12a gene was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplified from p3XFLAG-CMV-14-ISG12a (kindly
provided by Dr. Douglas W Leaman, The University
of Toledo), and inserted into pcDNA3.1/V5-His
(Invitrogen). The primers for amplification of ISG12a
are 5â²-CGCGCGGATCCATGG AGGCCTCTGCTCTC3â²(F), and 5â²-CTGCAGGAATTCGTAGAACCTCGCAAT
GA-3â²(R). The oligonucleotides encode 19-mer
hairpin sequence specific to the ISG12a mRNA were
incorporated into the pSilencer-neo plasmid (Ambion).
The sequences of ISG12a shRNAs targeting two regions
of ISG12a were 5â²-AAGTTCATCCTGGGCTCCATT-3â²
and
5â²-AATTAACCCGAGCAGGCATGG-3â².
Precursor of miR-942 was amplified from Huh7 cells
and inserted into pcDNA3.1/V5-His. The primers
for miR-942 are 5â²-GCATGGATCCGCTTTAACA
ATGGTTCCTCCG-3â²(F)
and
5â²-GCCGGTCTAGAAGCACCTTTTGTTTCTATTAT
CACG-3â²(R). All constructs were confirmed, and
transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents
(Invitrogen).

Flow cytometry analysis
The procedure has been published previously [20].

Luciferase Assay
The 3âUTR of the human ISG12a gene
were PCR amplified using the following primers:
5â-TTAATAATCTAGACTCCCTGCCCCTCGCCCTGCA
-3â (F) and 5â-GCGCCGGGTCTAGAGAAGAGTT
GCAACAATTCATC-3â(R). They were then cloned
downstream of the Renilla luciferase stop codon in pGL3
control vector (Promega). CHO cells were cotransfected
with 1Î¼g of ISG12a-3âUTR or 1Î¼g of ISG12a-3âUTR-Mut plasmids and 100 ng of Renilla luciferase
expression construct, pRL-CMV (Promega) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested
24 hr posttransfection and assayed with Dual Luciferase
Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturerâs
instructions. Three independent experiments were
performed in triplicate. DNA fragments containing
the putative regulatory regions upstream to miR-942
(from +1~-600 nt, +1~-2000 (+1 position corresponds
to the 5â terminus of miR-942 hairpin) were amplified
and cloned in pGL3basic (Promega). CHO cells were
transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), 1.0
Î¼g of pGL3basic empty vector or of pGL3 containing the
above genomic fragments, 100 ng of Renilla luciferase
expression construct pRL-CMV (Promega) and AKT
siRNA. After 48h, cells were lysed and assayed with
Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega) according to the
manufacturerâs instructions. The primers utilized for
the cloning were the followings: -2000pGL3b Forw:
5â-ggtaccgctttagactcaataatttaggacgattag -3â

Cells were exposed to TRAIL for 4 hours. Cellular
DNA was isolated and 2 Î¼g of DNA was separated on 1%
agarose gel at 50V for one hour.

Western blot analysis
The protocol has been reported previously [21].

Quantitative real-time PCR
The procedure has been published previously
[22, 23]. The cDNA of miR-942 were synthesized
from total RNA using stem-loop RT primer
(5â²-GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATT
CGCACTGGATACGACCACAT-3â²),
and
miR942 was quantized by real-time PCR using primers
5-GCGCGCTCTTCTCTGTTTTGGC-3â²
and
5â²-GTGCAGGGTCCGAGGT-3â².
The
internal
control was U6. The cDNA of U6 were synthesized
from total RNA using stem-loop RT primer
(5â²-CGCTTCACGAATTTGCGTGTCAT-3â²),
and
U6 was quantized by real-time PCR using primers
5â²-GCTTCGGCAGCACATATACAAAAT-3â²
and
5â²-CGCTTCACGAATTTGCGTGTCAT-3â².

In vivo animal experiments
Animal studies were performed according to the
protocol approved by Hunan Provincial Tumor Hospital
Review Board. Huh7 cells were transfected with
pcDNA3.1-ISG12a or pcDNA3.1 vector. The plasmid
pSilencer-ISG12a shRNA or pSilencer-control shRNA was
delivered into LH86 cells. After selection in antibiotics
for 10 days, 5 x 106 cells in 200ÂµL PBS were injected
subcutaneously into the low right flank of 6-week-old male
NOD/SCID immunodeficiency mice. Treatment started 10
days from the cells inoculation via tail vein injections of
