Of particular interest are the arylamine N-acetyltransferases
(NAT; EC 2.3.1.5), which catalyze the bioactivation and detoxification of many arylamine and heterocyclic amine carcinogens.
Human exposure to these carcinogens occurs during consumption of meat and through the use of tobacco products. Both
classes of carcinogens induce prostate tumors in animal models
(8, 9). Recently, it has been reported that human prostate tissue,
as well as prostate cells in culture, contains measurable levels of
the enzymes required for the activation of arylamine carcinogens
(10–14).
There are two functional NATs in humans (NAT1 and NAT2),
and both exhibit genetic polymorphisms that affect enzyme activity
(15). One allele of the NAT1 gene, NAT1*10, has been associated
with an increased risk for a number of different cancers, including
cancer of the prostate (16–18). In some studies, this allele leads to
an elevation in enzyme activity, in particular tissues such as the
colon and bladder (19). However, the NATs are influenced by
environmental factors that can both induce and inhibit cellular
activity (20, 21). An understanding of how these genes are regulated
by the environment is therefore important for deciphering their
role in diseases.
Several studies have shown that mouse NAT2 (which is
homologous to human NAT1) expression in the kidney exhibits a
sexual dimorphism (22, 23). Smolen et al. (22) showed that the
developmental difference in mouse kidney NAT2 activity was due
to an increase in testosterone. Androgenic modulation of NAT2
was caused by an increase in mRNA levels and subsequent
elevation in NAT2 protein content.
An androgen responsive element has been identified in an
intronic sequence of the mouse NAT2 gene (24). However, the
human homologue (NAT1) seems to have a different gene structure
and promoter elements (25, 26) than that described for the mouse
NAT2 gene (27). We were therefore interested in whether the
human NAT1 gene is regulated by androgens. Using human
prostate cancer cells that were androgen receptor (AR) positive or
AR negative, we found in the present study that NAT1 activity was
induced by AR activation as a result of increased NAT1 gene
expression. However, activated AR did not seem to directly regulate
NAT1. We mapped a 157-bp region of NAT1 promoter 1 (P1) that
contains the motif responsible for androgen up-regulation of NAT1.
In addition, we show that NAT1 expression in human prostate
tissue is greatest in epithelial cells, the cell type where AR is
predominantly expressed.

Abstract
Human arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NAT) bioactivate
arylamine and heterocyclic amine carcinogens present in
red meat and tobacco products. As a result, factors that
regulate expression of NATs have the potential to modulate
cancer risk in individuals exposed to these classes of
carcinogens. Because epidemiologic studies have implicated
well-done meat consumption as a risk factor for prostate
cancer, we have investigated the effects of androgens on the
expression of arylamine N-acetyltransferase type I (NAT1). We
show that NAT1 activity is induced by R1881 in androgen
receptor (AR)–positive prostate lines 22Rv1 and LNCaP, but
not in the AR-negative PC-3, HK-293, or HeLa cells. The effect
of R1881 was dose dependent, with an EC50 for R1881 of 1.6
nmol/L. Androgen up-regulation of NAT1 was prevented by
the AR antagonist flutamide. Real-time PCR showed a
significant increase in NAT1 mRNA levels for R1881-treated
cells (6.60 F 0.80) compared with vehicle-treated controls
(1.53 F 0.17), which was not due to a change in mRNA
stability. The increase in NAT1 mRNA was attenuated by
concurrent cycloheximide treatment, suggesting that the
effect of R1881 may not be by direct transcriptional activation
of NAT1. The dominant NAT1 transcript present following
androgen treatment was type IIA, indicating transcriptional
activation from the major NAT1 promoter P1. A series of
luciferase reporter deletions mapped the androgen responsive
motifs to a 157-bp region of P1 located 745 bases upstream of
the first exon. These results show that human NAT1 is induced
by androgens, which may have implications for cancer risk in
individuals. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):85–92]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers
in men from Western countries (1, 2). Whereas the etiology of
prostate cancer is not completely understood, there is compelling
epidemiologic evidence implicating intake of dietary components
such as animal fat, meat, and dairy products as a significant risk
factor for the disease (3–5). Studies into the genetic susceptibility
for prostate cancer have identified a number of genes that either
increase or decrease risk. These include genes that encode proteins
involved in androgen metabolism and signaling (6, 7) and the
metabolic activation/detoxification of carcinogens (7).

as outlined in the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase activities were
normalized to total protein.
Extraction of total RNA and reverse transcription. Monolayer
cultures were washed with PBS and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was
resuspended in RNase-free water and reverse transcribed using Superscript
II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega) as
outlined in the manufacturer’s instructions. For each RNA sample, a
reaction lacking reverse transcriptase was done and used in subsequent
PCR to ensure no DNA contamination.
Identification of NAT1 transcripts by reverse transcription-PCR.
First-strand cDNA was amplified by PCR using forward primers designed to
detect each of the exonic sequences known to exist in the 5¶-untranslated
region (5¶-UTR) of NAT1, in combination with a common reverse primer
located in the NAT1 coding sequence. The primers and PCR conditions
have previously been reported (26).
Quantitative real-time PCR. Expression levels of NAT1 mRNA were
determined using the iCycler IQ Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).
First-strand cDNA was amplified using specific primers for NAT1 or h-actin
(see Supplementary Table S1). Reactions contained iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad),
6 pmol of each primer, and 2 AL of cDNA mix in a total volume of 25 AL.
Samples were amplified using the following conditions: initial denaturation
at 95jC for 90 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95jC for 15 s, and
annealing/extension at 51jC for 60 s. A melting curve was obtained to verify
specificity of the PCR. Samples were analyzed using the standard curve
method. Standard curves were generated for NAT1 and h-actin using
10-fold serial dilutions of cDNA from controls. Expression values for
samples were then determined from the standard curves and NAT1 values
were normalized to h-actin.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded normal
human prostate tissue was prepared using conventional histologic methods.
Serial tissue sections (6 Am) were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated
through graded alcohol, and rinsed in distilled water. Antigen retrieval was
done in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 3.0) in a microwave oven (AR
staining) or by proteinase K treatment (NAT1 staining). Endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2 in water for 5 min. Slides
were blocked with rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; 50 Ag/mL) for AR
staining or with rabbit preimmune serum (1:100) for NAT1 staining. Rabbit
IgG and preimmune serum epitopes were blocked by treatment with Alexa
Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (20 Ag/mL; BioScientific, Gymea, New South
Wales, Australia). Slides were then treated with affinity-purified polyclonal
rabbit anti-human AR antibody (50 Ag/mL; AB561P, Chemicon, Boronia,
Victoria, Australia) or human NAT1 rabbit antiserum (1:100; produced as
described in ref. 29) at 4jC overnight. After washing, slides were incubated
with Dako EnVision Plus HRP (Dako, Botany, New South Wales, Australia)
for 30 min. Diaminobenzidine Plus was used as the chromogen. Nuclei were
lightly counterstained with hematoxylin and sections were dehydrated and
permanently mounted.
Data analysis and statistics. Data are expressed as mean F SE.
Statistical comparisons between different treatments were assessed by
Student’s t tests or one-way ANOVA assuming significance at P V 0.05. EC50
values for R1881 were estimated by fitting a standard sigmoidal doseresponse model to the data using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San
Diego, CA).

a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For androgen-free conditions,
cells were cultured in phenol red–free DMEM supplemented with 5%
dextran-coated charcoal-stripped FBS. Cells were treated with up to 100
nmol/L R1881 (Perkin-Elmer, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) or vehicle
(DMSO) for up to 48 h under androgen-free conditions. AR antagonists
bicalutamide (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, ON, Canada) and
flutamide (Sigma, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia) were used at 10
Amol/L. Actinomycin D (Sigma) was used at 5 Ag/mL and cycloheximide
(Sigma) at 20 Ag/mL.
Assay of NAT1 activity. Cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended
in buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 1 mmol/L DTT],
and lysed on ice by sonication. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 4jC and
the supernatant assayed for NAT1 activity as previously described (21).
Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (28).
Western blot analysis. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein
were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with a polyclonal NAT1-specific
antibody (29) as previously described (21).
DNA cloning of NAT1 P1. A 4,228-bp fragment of NAT1 P1 was
amplified from 22Rv1 genomic DNA by PCR using primers and conditions
previously described (25). This fragment was digested with HindIII and
cloned into HindIII-digested, shrimp alkaline phosphatase–treated pGL3enhancer (Promega, Annandale, New South Wales, Australia), yielding
pGL3-ex4-3657, where the number indicates base pairs upstream of exon 4.
NAT1 P1 construct pGL3-ex4-257 was made by PCR using pGL3-ex4-3657 as
template and forward primer FP4 (see Supplementary Table S1), which
contains an artificial KpnI restriction site, together with the reverse primer
used to PCR the 4,228-bp fragment. This PCR fragment was digested with
KpnI and HindIII and cloned into the same sites of pGL3-enhancer. A series
of deletion constructs was made by PCR using forward primers FP1, FP2,
FP3, FP5, FP6, and FP7 (see Supplementary Table S1) together with reverse
primer RP4, yielding pGL3-ex4-2972, pGL3-ex4-1865, pGL3-ex4-902, pGL3ex4-745, pGL3-ex4-587, and pGL3-ex4-438, respectively. All primers
contained KpnI sites and PCR fragments were cloned into KpnI-digested,
shrimp alkaline phosphatase–treated pGL3-ex4-257. All clones were verified
by DNA sequencing.
Transient transfection. 22Rv1 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a
density of 2.5  105 per well and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were
then transfected with 200 ng of the androgen-responsive probasin promoter
luciferase construct pARR3-TK-Luc (ref. 30; courtesy of Prof. Peter
Leedman, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research, Perth, Western
Australia, Australia) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Melbourne,
Victoria, Australia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and
incubated for 24 h under androgen-free conditions. Cells were then treated
with R1881 and/or AR antagonists under androgen-free conditions for up
to 24 h, washed twice with PBS, and prepared for luciferase assay. PC-3
cells were transfected with the AR expression vector pCMV-AR3.1 (ref. 31;
courtesy of Wayne Tilley, Hanson Institute, Adelaide, New South Wales,
Australia) and pARR3-TK-Luc by electroporation using a Bio-Rad GenePulser Xcell (280 V, 200 AF, 50 V; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Briefly, 15-Ag pCMVAR3.1 and 5-Ag pARR3-TK-Luc were added to 0.4-mL cells (1  107/mL) in
PBS and electroporated in a 2-mm cuvette. Electroporated cells were then
diluted in DMEM (5% FBS) and seeded at a density of 2.5  105/mL in
24-well plates. The cells were allowed to adhere overnight and then were
treated with either 100 nmol/L R1881 or vehicle under androgen-free
conditions for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and cell lysates
prepared for either NAT1 assay or luciferase assay. For promoter studies,
cells were seeded at a density of 2.5  105/mL in 24-well plates and allowed
to adhere overnight. Cells were transfected with 1 Ag DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 and incubated for 24 h, after which they were treated with
vehicle or 100 nmol/L R1881 under androgen-free conditions for a further
24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysates prepared for luciferase
assay. The transfection efficiency of electroporated cells was determined by
transfection with 20-Ag pEGFP (Scientifix, Cheltenham, Victoria, Australia).
Transfected cells were determined by flow cytometry 48 h after transfection.
Luciferase assay. Cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer and firefly
luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega)

Results
R1881 induced NAT1 activity in AR-positive prostate cancer
cells. Initially, the effect of the androgen R1881 on NAT1 activity
was investigated in the AR-positive prostate cell lines 22Rv1 and
LNCaP as well as the AR-negative cell lines PC-3 (prostate), HK-293
(kidney), and HeLa (cervical). Both AR-positive lines showed a
higher basal level of NAT1 activity (46–51 nmol/min/mg protein)
compared with the AR-negative lines (<15 nmol/min/mg protein).
Following treatment with 100 nmol/L R1881 for 24 h, there was a
significant increase in NAT1 activity in both 22Rv1 (2.5-fold) and

Androgenic Regulation of Human NAT1

that the half-life of NAT1 is f22 h in human cells (34), we
interpreted these results to suggest that the high basal level of
NAT1 activity in the AR-positive lines was not due to endogenous
androgen activation of NAT1 expression.
Androgens increase NAT1 transcription. Western blot analysis of 22Rv1 cells treated with 100 nmol/L R1881 showed an
increase in cellular NAT1 protein compared with vehicle-treated
controls (Fig. 2A). Quantification by densitometry (Quantity One
software, Bio-Rad) indicated a 2.2-fold increase in NAT1 protein
content, which was similar to the observed increase in NAT1
activity (Fig. 1A). To determine if the increase in NAT1 protein was
a result of elevated NAT1 mRNA levels, NAT1 mRNA from 22Rv1
cells treated with 100 nmol/L R1881 was quantified by real-time
PCR. A significant increase in NAT1 mRNA for R1881-treated cells
(6.60 F 0.80) compared with vehicle-treated controls (1.53 F 0.17)
was seen (Fig. 2B).
Because androgens have been shown to regulate gene expression
in part by stabilizing mRNA (35), we determined the decay rate of
NAT1 mRNA in the absence and presence of R1881 by real-time
PCR of 22Rv1 cells when transcription was blocked with
actinomycin D (Fig. 2C). In the absence of the drug, the half-life
of NAT1 message was 3.49 F 0.18 h, which was not significantly
different from that in the presence of the drug (3.62 F 0.14 h).
Taken together, the above results suggest that R1881 increases
NAT1 activity, at least in part, by an increase in gene transcription
without affecting message stability.
NAT1 mRNA has previously been shown to consist of several
splice variants that differ in the sequence of the 5¶-UTR (25, 26). In
addition, at least two independent promoters (P1 and P3 according
to the nomenclature in ref. 25) have been identified that use
markedly different transcriptional start sites. Amplification of the
different splice variants as previously described (26) showed that
the major splice variant in untreated 22Rv1 cells was type IIA
(Fig. 2D, left), which consists of exons 4 and 8 in the 5¶-UTR,

LNCaP (1.5-fold) cells but not in PC-3, HK-293, or HeLa cells
(Fig. 1A). The effect of androgen was dose dependent (Fig. 1B,
closed symbols). In 22Rv1 cells, a maximum NAT1 activity of
140 nmol/min/mg protein was seen at R1881 concentrations >10
nmol/L. The estimated EC50 for R1881 was 1.6 nmol/L (95%
confidence interval, 1.3–2.0 nmol/L). When 22Rv1 cells were
transfected with the AR reporter construct pARR3-TK-Luc, the
EC50 for R1881 induction of luciferase was significantly less than
that for induction of NAT1 (54 pmol/L; Fig. 1B, open symbols), but
similar to the reporter EC50 for this drug in other AR-dependent
expression systems (32).
To determine whether the induction of NAT1 by R1881 involved
the AR, 22Rv1 cells were treated with the drug (0.3 nmol/L) in the
absence or presence of the AR competitive antagonists flutamide
or bicalutamide. Both antagonists completely inhibited the effects
of R1881 on NAT1 activity, confirming their inhibitory action on AR
in these studies (Fig. 1C, closed bars). Moreover, in studies under
identical conditions with the AR reporter construct, both
antagonists also reversed the effects of R1881 (Fig. 1C, open bars).
These results indicate that the induction of NAT1 by R1881
involved activation of the AR.
Because the basal level of NAT1 activity was significantly higher
in the AR-positive cells (see above), an experiment was conducted
to determine if this could be explained by the endogenous
androgens found in bovine serum used to culture the cells. The
AR-positive line 22Rv1 was grown for up to 48 h in medium
supplemented with charcoal-stripped serum and devoid of phenol
red to reduce endogenous androgenic activity (33). In addition,
bicalutamide was added to further ensure inhibition of any
endogenous androgen. Figure 1D shows that, under these
conditions, the AR antagonist could completely inhibit the effect
of R1881 (closed bars, positive control). However, the activity of
NAT1 in cells not treated with R1881 did not change over 48 h in
the presence of the antagonist. Because we have previously shown

of exons. The different transcripts present can be deduced by the product sizes.

same for each gene. To investigate this possibility further, the time
course of R1881-dependent induction for NAT1 and the AR
reporter construct pARR3-TK-Luc was determined in 22Rv1 cells.
A significant increase in NAT1 activity was seen after 8-h treatment
and induction continued up to 48 h (Fig. 3A, closed circles). By
contrast, luciferase activity increased after only 2 h of treatment
and was maximal by 16 h (Fig. 3A, open circles). This difference in
time course supported the notion that the activation of the two
genes may not proceed by a common mechanism.
If NAT1 transcription is directly up-regulated by androgen, then
the lack of effect of R1881 in AR-negative cells should be overcome
by transfection of these cells with an AR expression vector.
However, when PC-3 cells were transiently transfected with pCMVAR3.1, NAT1 activity was not affected by treatment with 100 nmol/L
R1881 (Table 1), despite a >50% transfection efficiency. To show

together with exon 9, which contains the protein coding region.
There also was little or no evidence of the minor transcripts type
IIB (exons 4, 7, 8, and 9), type IID (exons 4, 6, 8, and 9), and type IIE
(exons 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9) in untreated cells. In addition, there was no
evidence for transcripts originating from P3. Following treatment
with 100 nmol/L R1881, minor transcripts originating from P1
became evident but type IIA remained the most prominent. Again,
there was no indication of transcripts originating from P3 (Fig. 2D,
right). These results suggest that the increase in NAT1 gene
transcription induced by R1881 is due to activation of the P1
promoter.
Androgen induction of NAT1 is an indirect effect. The
marked difference in the EC50 for R1881 activation of NAT1 activity
and activation of luciferase activity from the AR reporter construct
suggested that the mode of activity of the drug may not be the

mRNA by f6-fold compared with untreated cells, and that this
induction was attenuated by concurrent treatment with cycloheximide. Therefore, NAT1 transcriptional activation by R1881
requires prior protein synthesis and suggests that the AR may
induce a secondary transcription factor that functions at the NAT1
promoter.
Identification of a region of P1 that responds to androgen.
Initially, the luciferase reporter construct pGL3-ex4-3657 (where the
number indicates bp upstream of exon 4 and is the same as pGL34228 used in ref. 25) was transfected into 22Rv1 cells and then
treated with either vehicle or 100 nmol/L R1881. The luciferase
activity from androgen-treated cells was 2.6-fold higher than that of
vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 4A). Because the motif responsible for

that the expression vector was functional under these conditions,
PC-3 cells were cotransfected with pCMV-AR3.1 and the AR
reporter construct pARR3-TK-Luc. Following treatment with R1881
(100 nmol/L), a significant increase in luciferase expression was
observed (Table 1), indicating functional AR in these cells, which is
similar to several other reports (36, 37).
The lack of induction of NAT1 in AR-transfected PC-3 cells,
along with the differences in dose and time kinetics compared with
the AR reporter construct, suggested that the effect of R1881 may
not be by direct transcriptional activation of the NAT1 gene. To test
this possibility, cycloheximide inhibition of translation was used to
determine whether protein synthesis was a necessary step in NAT1
mRNA induction. Figure 3B shows that R1881 increased NAT1

restored original levels of activity. This led the authors to suggest
that androgen modulation of NAT2 acetylating capacity may be
responsible for the observed higher susceptibility of male mice to
arylamine-induced carcinogenesis. Characterization of the mouse
NAT2 promoter identified a hormone response element that may
be responsible for the androgenic regulation of NAT2 in mouse
kidney (23). However, the hormone response element resides in an
intronic sequence and was not shown to be functional in the
context of the promoter. The above observations prompted us to
investigate the possibility that human NAT1 expression was
regulated by androgens.
The synthetic androgen R1881 induced NAT1 activity in the ARpositive prostate cell lines 22Rv1 and LNCaP in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner. The induction of NAT1 was
prevented by AR antagonists, indicating that AR activation was
required. This is also supported by immunohistochemical data
showing NAT1 protein staining to be greatest in the epithelial cells
where AR is almost exclusively expressed in the prostate. The
localization of NAT1 in human prostate tissue to the epithelium is
similar to that reported elsewhere (11). The mechanism by which
androgen increased NAT1 protein levels was primarily by increased
transcription. There was a >4-fold increase in NAT1 transcript in
the presence of androgen, and this was not a result of message
stabilization as the mRNA decay rates in the absence and presence
of androgen were not significantly different.
The human NAT1 gene gives rise to mRNA consisting of several
different splice variants that differ only in the 5¶ noncoding
sequence, and at least two independent promoter regions have
been identified (25, 26). Amplification of the different mRNA splice
variants from 22Rv1 cells treated with androgen showed that all
detectable transcripts contained exon 4 and therefore originated
from the P1 promoter. Using a reporter construct containing a
3,657-bp fragment upstream of exon 4, we were able to show that
the motif responsible for androgen responsiveness was localized in
this region. A series of deletion constructs then allowed the
androgen responsive sequence to be mapped to a 157-bp sequence
located between 745 and 902 bp, relative to the start of exon 4.
Analysis of this sequence using MatInspector (39) identified 25

androgen up-regulation of NAT1 seemed to be in this region of
P1, a series of deletion constructs was made (pGL3-ex4-2972,
pGL3-ex4-1865, pGL3-ex4-902, and pGL3-ex4-257) to map this
region further. These reporter constructs were transfected into
22Rv1 cells, which were then treated with either vehicle or R1881.
Cells transfected with pGL3-ex4-2972, pGL3-ex4-1865, or pGL3ex4-902 showed 2.6-, 2.6-, and 2.4-fold increases in luciferase
activity, respectively (Fig. 4A). Cells transfected with pGL3-ex4-257
showed no evidence of R1881 induction. Therefore, the region
responding to androgen was located between 902 and 257 bp,
relative to the start of exon 4. To map the androgen-responsive
site further, pGL3-ex4-745, pGL3-ex4-587, and pGL3-ex4-439
reporter constructs were made. Transfection into 22Rv1 cells
and treatment with androgen revealed that none of the new
deletion constructs responded to R1881 treatment (Fig. 4B). It was
concluded that the 157-bp region between 902 and 745 bp
upstream of exon 4 contains elements responsible for androgen
up-regulation of NAT1. This region of the NAT1 gene is shown in
Fig. 4C. Putative transcription factor binding sites are indicated
on the sequence.
AR and NAT1 proteins are colocalized in human prostate.
Immunohistochemistry was done on sequential human prostate
tissue slices to determine if the expression of NAT1 protein was
higher in those cell types that expressed AR. AR exhibited a typical
luminal epithelial cell distribution, similar to that reported
elsewhere (38). The majority of the intracellular AR protein was
localized to the nuclei, although faint staining was evident in the
extranuclear space as well (Fig. 5, top). NAT1 was strongly localized
to AR-positive epithelium and dispersed throughout the cell (Fig. 5,
bottom). Some staining of nuclei as well as cytoplasmic bodies was
also seen. Control IgG staining is shown in Fig. 5 (left).

Discussion
A sexual dimorphism has been described for mouse kidney NAT2
activity, with males having about a 2-fold higher activity than
females (22). In the same study, castration reduced male kidney
NAT2 activity to female levels, whereas testosterone replacement

Androgenic Regulation of Human NAT1

serum used to culture the cells. This may be due to high basal
expression of the transcription factor that directly activates NAT1
gene expression and is subject to androgen regulation.
The potential role of the arylamine NATs in the development of
cancers through the bioactivation of procarcinogens is well
established (41, 42). As such, tissue-specific factors that up-regulate
expression of the NATs have the potential to enhance mutagenesis
and promote cancer. The up-regulation of NAT1 by androgens may
have functional significance in the prostate, as well as in the many
other tissues that express AR.
In conclusion, the present study has shown androgen-dependent
regulation of NAT1, which is mediated by increased transcriptional
activity of the NAT1 gene. Identification of the precise mechanism
that leads to this change in transcription is under investigation.
Because the arylamine NATs are able to bioactivate a number of
important human carcinogens (41), androgenic modulation may
have implications for cancer risk in individuals.

putative transcription factor binding sites. Of particular interest
was the presence of a putative X-box motif, which binds the basic
region leucine zipper transcription factor X-box binding protein-1
(XBP-1). XBP-1 is present in the prostate and has been shown to be
up-regulated in prostate cancer (40). Close examination of the
androgen-responsive sequence did not identify any AR binding
elements.
When the AR-negative PC-3 cells were transiently transfected
with AR, NAT1 expression was not affected by androgen treatment.
This suggested that the androgen signaling pathway responsible for
NAT1 up-regulation in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells was not intact in
these cells. In addition, the finding that cycloheximide abrogates
androgen-mediated increases in NAT1 mRNA indicated that
increased transcription of the NAT1 gene requires prior protein
synthesis, possibly of an androgen-regulated transcription factor.
Together, these data indicate that the activated AR does not
directly bind to the NAT1 promoter to increase transcription but
modulates the expression of a secondary transcription factor that
regulates NAT1. The indirect nature of androgen up-regulation of
NAT1 also is supported by the absence of an androgen response
element in the region of P1 identified as androgen responsive.
Interestingly, both AR-positive prostate cell lines that exhibited
androgen-mediated up-regulation of NAT1 have unusually high
basal expression levels, which is not due to androgen present in the
