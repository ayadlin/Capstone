ABSTRACT
Periostin (POSTN) expression in cancer cells and circulation has been related
to poor prognosis of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). However, the role of POSTN
expressed in intra-tumoral stroma on CRC progression remains largely unknown.
This study enrolled 1098 CRC patients who received surgical treatment in Shanghai
and Guangzhou, Mainland China. In Shanghai cohort, immunohistochemistry score of
stromal POSTN expression increased consecutively from adjacent mucosa, primary
CRC tissues, to metastatic CRC tissues (P < 0.001), while medium- and high-stromal
POSTN expression, rather than epithelial POSTN expression, independently predicted
unfavorable prognoses of CRC, adjusted for covariates including TNM stage and
postoperative chemotherapy in multivariate Cox models. The results in Shanghai
cohort were faithfully replicated in Guangzhou cohort. Stromal POSTN expression
dose-dependently predicted an unfavorable prognosis of stage III CRC patients with
postoperative chemotherapy in both cohorts. POSTN derived from colonic fibroblasts
or recombinant POSTN significantly promoted proliferation, anchorage independent
growth, invasion, and chemo-resistance of CRC cells; whereas these effects were
counteracted via targeting to PI3K/Akt or Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
CRC cell RKO-derived factor(s) significantly induced POSTN production in colonic
fibroblasts and autocrine POSTN promoted proliferation, migration, and anchorage
independent growth of fibroblasts. Conclusively, stromal POSTN is prognostic and
predictive for CRC via creating a niche to facilitate cancer progression. Targeting
POSTN-induced signaling pathways may be therapeutic options for metastatic or
chemoresistant CRC.

INTRODUCTION

and elucidate the mechanisms by which stromal POSTN
promoted the aggressiveness and drug-resistance of
CRC. This study should be helpful for the prediction and
targeted treatment of metastatic or chemoresistant CRC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most
common malignancies worldwide, with 1.23 million
newly diagnosed cases annually [1]. Surgical resection
is the primary option for CRC treatment. Approximately
20%–25% of CRC patients present with metastatic
disease at diagnosis and another 20%–25% will develop
metachronous metastases, resulting in an overall mortality
rate of 40%–45% [2]. Tumor stage, circumferential
resection margin involvement, obstruction/perforation,
rupture during surgery, vascular and perineural invasion,
poor differentiation, high-frequency microsatellite
instability, mismatch repair deficiency, thymidylate
synthase positivity, circulating tumor cells, KRAS
mutation, BRAF mutation, and elevated expression of
Snail or serpinA1 have been suggested to be prognostic for
CRC [2–5]. Postoperative chemotherapy is the standard
of care for stage III CRC patients. Some molecules or
signatures expressed in CRC tissues can be predictive
[6, 7]. Although these molecules are potentially prognostic
and/or predictive, few of them are clinically applied.
Identification of new biomarkers to improve CRC
prognosis classification and individualized treatment is
urgently needed.
Previously, we have demonstrated that periostin
(POSTN) is the top overlapping molecule in signatures
(4/5) with high concordance and repeatable prognostic
values for CRC. Further immunohistochemistry (IHC)
assays have demonstrated that POSTN is a key component
of the CRC cell-derived gene signature with robust
prognostic and predictive values [8]. POSTN, firstly
identified as osteoblast-specific factor 2 in 1993, is a
secretory, matricellular molecule with known functions
in bone development/maturation/repair, tissue repair,
mesenchymal remodeling, and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) [9]. POSTN expression in cancer cells
(epithelial POSTN expression) can promote metastatic
potential of CRC, via activating the PI3 kinase (PI3K)/
protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway [10]. In CRC
with liver metastasis, POSTN is significantly higher in
CD133+ than in CD133− tumor cells [11]. We and others
observed that POSTN was highly expressed in stromal
cells in CRC tissues [8, 12]. POSTN expressed in cancerassociated fibroblasts or other stromal cells may facilitate
the aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer,
prostate cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric
cancer, breast cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma [13–19].
The elevated level of POSTN in sera is also associated
with an unfavorable prognosis of CRC [20]. However,
the effect of POSTN expression in intratumoral stromal
cells (stromal POSTN expression) on the progression and
prognosis of CRC remains largely unknown. The objective
of this study is to clarify if stromal POSTN expression
in tumor tissues is prognostic and/or predictive for CRC

RESULTS
Expression pattern of POSTN in adjacent
mucosa, primary CRC, and metastatic
CRC tissues
Tissue microarrarys (TMAs) containing surgically
removed adjacent mucosa (n = 37), primary CRC at I–IV
stages (n = 755), and metastatic CRC specimens (n = 21)
from the 1st Affiliated Hospital of Second Military Medical
University were immunostained using antibody against
POSTN. POSTN was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm
of stromal cells and epithelial CRC cells, as shown in
Figure 1A. The immunostaining of POSTN was more
intensive in stromal cells than in epithelial cancer cells in
the specimens of 506 (67.02%) of the 755 CRC patients.
IHC score of stromal POSTN expression was significantly
higher in the metastatic CRC tissues than in primary CRC
tissues (P < 0.001) and also significantly higher in primary
CRC tissues than in the adjacent mucosa (P < 0.001), as
shown in Figure 1B. According to IHC scores of stromal
or epithelial POSTN expression, CRC patients were
classified into 3 groups: low- (0–4), medium- (6–8), and
high-score (9–12) groups. High IHC score of stromal
POSTN expression was significantly associated with low
differentiation grade (P < 0.001) and high TNM stage
(P < 0.001) in 755 CRC patients (Table 1).

Stromal POSTN expression had higher
discriminatory performances than epithelial
POSTN expression in predicting postoperative
prognosis of CRC
To compare the contributions of stromal POSTN and
epithelial POSTN expression to postoperative prognosis of
CRC, we initially included 682 stage I-III CRC patients
who received curative surgery and regular follow-up in
Shanghai cohort. The 5-year rates of disease-free survival
(DFS) were 93.6%, 72.9%, and 42.3%; while the 5-year
rates of disease-specific survival (DSS) were 96.2%,
85.4%, and 65.6%, in the groups with low-, medium-, and
high-score of stromal POSTN expression, respectively
(P < 0.001 for each). Patients with higher score of
stromal POSTN expression had shorter DSS and DFS
(Figure 2A, 2C). In terms of epithelial POSTN expression,
however, the survivals were not significantly different
between patients with high-score and those with mediumscore (Figure 2B, 2D). Next, the prognostic values of
POSTN expression were validated in Guangzhou cohort

that medium-score and high-score stromal POSTN
expression, rather than epithelial POSTN expression,

fibroblast cell line, and generated a stable POSTNexpression cell line named CCD-18Co-POSTN. Similarly,
the corresponding empty lentiviral vector was applied to
generate a control fibroblast clone named CCD-18CoNC. With the use of quantitative reverse transcription
PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, we confirmed that
POSTN expression was significantly higher in CCD18Co-POSTN than in CCD-18Co-NC and parental CCD18Co cells, respectively (Figure 4A, 4B). To elucidate
the effects of POSTN derived from fibroblasts on CRC
cells, we examined proliferation, anchorage independent
growth, and invasion of SW480 and HT29 cells cultured
with conditional media of CCD-18Co-POSTN and CCD18Co-NC cells, respectively. As expected, SW480 and
HT29 cells proliferated faster and formed more clones
in CCD-18Co-POSTN medium than in CCD-18Co-NC
medium (Figure 4C, 4D, 4E). CCD-18Co-POSTN medium

significantly enhanced invasion of SW480 and HT29 cells
than did CCD-18Co-NC medium (Figure 4F). To further
elucidate the role of POSTN on the aggressiveness of
CRC cells and the underlying mechanism, recombinant
human POSTN (rhPOSTN), PI3K/Akt kinase inhibitor
LY294002, and β-catenin-specific inhibitor XAV939
were applied in the in vitro study of CRC cells. It was
found that 100 ng/mL rhPOSTN significantly increased
proliferation of SW480 and HT29 cells; whereas 10 μM
LY294002 or XAV939 significantly decreased proliferation
of CRC cells (Figure 4G). Western blot assays showed
that rhPOSTN apparently increased phosphorylation of
Akt (pAkt) in SW480 and HT29 cells and expression
level of β-catenin in HT29 cells; whereas 10 μM
LY294002 or XAV939 apparently reduced rhPOSTNupregulated expression of pAkt and β-catenin in CRC
cells (Figure 4H). Anchorage independent growth of CRC

this effect was significantly counteracted by LY294002
or XAV939 (Figure 4I). Invasion of CRC cells was also
significantly increased by rhPOSTN but greatly reduced

(Figure 4J).

decreased by the inhibitors, especially by PI3K/Akt kinase
inhibitor LY294002 (Figure 5C).

POSTN increased the chemo-resistance of

To explore the effect of CRC cells on expression
of POSTN in colonic fibroblasts, we cultured parental
CCD-18Co cells with conditional media of CRC cell
lines SW480, HT29, LoVo, and RKO, respectively. It was
found that RKO conditional medium significantly induced
the expression of POSTN in CCD-18Co, as verified by
qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses (Figure 6A, 6B).
Surprisingly, CCD-18Co cultured with RKO conditional
medium grew significantly faster than did CCD-18Co
cultured routinely (Figure 6C). CCD-18Co-POSTN cells

significantly increased the chemo-resistance of SW480

100 ng/mL rhPOSTN greatly increased the chemoresistance of both CRC cells to 5-FU (Figure 5B).

with high POSTN expression also grew faster than did the
counterparts with low POSTN expression (CCD-18CoNC and CCD-18Co) (Figure 6D). Further experimentation
indicated that CCD-18Co-POSTN was more migratory but
not more invasive than CCD-18Co-NC (Figure 6E, 6F).
CCD-18Co-POSTN had a higher clone formation rate
than did CCD-18Co-NC, but this effect was counteracted
by LY294002 or XAV939. Western blot analyses showed
that expression levels of pAkt and β-catenin were higher

promoting cancer spread and metastasis [24, 26, 27]. Thus,
stromal POSTN whose expression accumulates during
CRC progression promotes cancer cell survival, growth,
and invasiveness via activating oncogenic pathways such
as PI3K/Akt and/or Wnt/β-catenin pathways.
We found that stromal POSTN expression in primary
CRC tissues dose-dependently predicted an unfavorable
prognosis of stage III CRC patients with postoperative
chemotherapy (Figure 3). Interestingly, POSTN in cell
culture significantly improved the chemo-resistance
of CRC cells but this effect was greatly decreased
via targeting to PI3K/Akt or Wnt/β-catenin pathways
(Figure 5). Tumor stem cells are naturally chemoresistant.
Molecules that confer the chemoresistence usually
increase the “stemness” of cancer cells via activating the
“stemness”-supportive signaling pathways such as Wnt/βcatenin [28, 29]. Ectopic overexpression of POSTN or
recombinant POSTN can induce multipotent stem cell-like
properties in human mammary epithelial cells and breast
cancer cells [30]. Expression of POSTN is significantly
higher in CD133+ CRC cells compared to CD133−
CRC cells [11]. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway often
promotes the evolution of the chemo-resistant “stemness”
of CRC [28, 29, 31]. Targeting PI3K/Akt or ERK signaling
pathway can attenuate the growth of CRC cells or sensitize
CRC cell lines to 5-FU [32, 33]. Based on our results and
the published data, we hypothesize that POSTN derived
from colonic fibroblasts facilitates the evolution of cancer
stem cells via activating PI3K/Akt and/or Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathways. Our data support that stromal POSTN
expression is predictive for chemo-resistance of CRC.
Targeting POSTN/αvβ3–6 integrins/PI3K/Akt and/or
Wnt/β-catenin pathways should be therapeutic options for
metastatic or chemoresistant CRC.
It is well established that chronic inflammation
promotes the development of CRC. Some proinflammatory
or immunosuppressive molecules including TGF-β1,
2, and 3, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
interleukin (IL)-3, 4, 6, and 13 can induce the expression
of POSTN in a cell-specific context [10]. In this study,
we found that conditional medium of RKO could induce
POSTN production in fibroblasts, possibly because RKO
secretes immunosuppressive factors such as TGF-β1,
VEGF, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and prostaglandin E2 [34].
These CRC cell-derived factors can induce the expression
of POSTN in colonic fibroblasts and autocrine POSTN
in turn promoted proliferation, migration, and anchorage
independent growth of colonic fibroblasts (Figure 6).
Cancer cells can induce fibroblast-mediated accumulation

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrated that stromal
POSTN expression was gradually increased from normal
tissues, primary CRC tissues to metastatic CRC tissues
(Figure 1), indicating that stromal POSTN expression
accumulates consecutively during CRC progression.
Importantly, stromal POSTN expression in primary CRC
tissues dose-dependently predicted poor postoperative
prognoses and had a higher discriminatory performance
than did epithelial POSTN expression. Multivariate Cox
regression analyses indicated that medium- and high-score
stromal POSTN expression, rather than epithelial POSTN
expression, predicted unfavorable postoperative prognoses
independently in both cohorts (Table 2). Furthermore,
medium-score stromal POSTN expression is comparable
to the CRC cell-derived gene signature in predicting
DFS of the same CRC patients in Shanghai cohort; while
medium-and high-score stromal POSTN expression is
also comparable to the CRC cell-derived gene signature
in predicting DSS in Guangzhou cohort [8]. Thus, stromal
POSTN expression in surgically removed tumors should
be a powerful and robust prognostic biomarker for CRC,
which is worth being clinically translated.
This study revealed that POSTN secreted from
gene-transfected colonic fibroblasts or rhPOSTN greatly
promoted proliferation, anchorage independent growth,
and invasion of CRC cell lines. These effects of POSTN
should be realized via interacting with its receptors, αvintegrins, on CRC cell lines. αvβ3, αvβ5, and/or α6β4
integrin complex are cell surface receptors of POSTN
in CRC, pancreatic cancer, epithelial ovarian carcinoma,
esophageal adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer cells
[10, 21–23]. We found that external POSTN induced
phosphorylation of Akt and the expression of β-catenin
in CRC cells and the effects of POSTN on CRC cells
could be greatly counteracted via targeting PI3K/Akt
or Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Figure 4). Based on our
findings together with previous publications [9, 10, 14,
17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25], we believe that POSTN may
induce phosphorylation of Akt and focal adhesion kinase
(FAK) after binds to its receptors, thus activating PI3K/

of stromal POSTN and POSTN derived from cancer
stem cells can recruit M2 tumor-associated macrophages
and promotes malignant growth [35, 36], indicating that
POSTN bridges cancer cells and cancer-supportive stromal
cells. Like other cancer biomarkers such as α-fetoprotein,
POSTN is actively expressed in a specific temporal and
spatial pattern during embryogenesis, silenced after birth,
and re-expressed in response to mechanical stress or
carcinogenesis [9]. These evidences indicate that stromal
POSTN may be re-expressed by proinflammatory factors
in chronic tumor-supportive inflammation, and facilitate
cancer evolution and development via creating a cancersupportive niche.
In summary, stromal POSTN expression in primary
tumor tissues independently predicted an unfavorable
prognosis of CRC patients after the adjustment with
covariates including TNM stage and postoperative
chemotherapy. Stromal POSTN expression also predicted
a poor prognosis of CRC patients with postoperative
chemotherapy dose-dependently. Both of POSTN derived
from colonic fibroblasts and rhPOSTN significantly
promoted proliferation, anchorage independent growth,
invasion, and chemo-resistance of CRC cells; however
these effects were greatly counteracted via targeting to
PI3K/Akt or Wnt/β-catenin pathways. CRC cell line RKOsecreted factors can induce the production of POSTN
in colonic fibroblasts and POSTN in turn promoted
proliferation, migration, and anchorage independent
growth of colonic fibroblasts. Thus, stromal POSTN
expression is prognostic and predictive for CRC, which
is worth being clinically translated. POSTN may facilitate
the evolution and development of CRC via creating a
cancer-supportive niche. Targeting POSTN-induced
signaling pathways should be therapeutic options for
metastatic or chemoresistant CRC.

chemotherapy (FOLFOX regimen). Baseline information of
each specimen donor in Shanghai cohort was summarized
in Table 1. Follow-up exam of 1025 patients with stage
I–III CRC were carried out as previously reported [8]. DFS
and DSS were defined as previously described [8]. This
study was approved by the institutional review boards of
The 1st Affiliated Hospital of Second Military Medical
University and The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun YetSen University. Informed consent has been obtained.

IHC
TMAs were developed as previously described
[8]. IHC was carried out in Pathology Core Laboratory
of the 1st Affiliated Hospital of Second Military Medical
University. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human
POSTN (1:500, ab14041, Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
were used for IHC according to protocols provided by
the manufacturers. The specificity and intratumoural
heterogeneity of this antibody has been verified in our
previous study [8]. Scores were independently assessed
by the first 4 authors and then verified by two pathologists
(YY and YD). Briefly, intensity of immunostaining in
stromal cells or epithelial cancer cells in tumor specimens
was graded as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) and
3 (strong); staining extent was graded as 0 (0%–4%),
1 (5%–24%), 2 (25%–49%), 3 (50%–74%) and 4 (>75%).
Values of the intensity and the extent were multiplied as
an immunoreactive score. POSTN expression was graded
as low (scores, 0–4), medium (scores, 6–8) and high
(scores, 9–12). Disagreements among the researchers were
resolved by consensus.

Cell culture
Human colonic fibroblast cell line (CCD-18Co)
and 4 human CRC cell lines (SW480, HT29, LoVo, and
RKO) were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were maintained
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (GIBCO, Grand
Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO), 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in a 5% CO2 humidified
atmosphere.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Pathologically proven formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) specimens of 1098 CRC patients were
enrolled in this study. Of these, 755 received curative
surgery in the 1st Affiliated Hospital of Second Military
Medical University (Shanghai, China) between January
2001 and December 2009 and 343 received curative
surgery in the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-Sen
University (Guangzhou, China) between January 2000
and January 2006. In addition, we also included FFPE
specimens of surgically removed adjacent mucosa from 37
CRC patients and surgically removed metastatic CRC from
21 CRC patients. TNM staging was reclassified according
to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
staging system (seventh edition). Some of them, especially
stage III CRC patients received a standard postoperative

Vector construction, transfection, and generation
of POSTN-producing colonic fibroblasts
A full-length of human POSTN cDNA clone
(CDS-h13016-2) was purchased from Axybio (Changsha,
China), released by SalI and EcoRI digestion, and inserted
into pLenO-GTP lentiviral vector (Invabio, Shanghai,
China). The resulting pLenO-GTP-POSTN lentiviral
construct was verified by direct DNA sequencing. The
empty pLenO-GTP lentiviral vector served as a negative
control, named pLenO-GTP-NC. The two constructs

pLenO-GTP-POSTN and pLenO-GTP-NC were transfected
into 293T cells to propagate lentiviruses, respectively.
CCD-18Co cells were incubated with lentiviruses
containing pLenO-GTP-POSTN or pLenO-GTP-NC with
4 mg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis) for 96 hrs,
and then selected in the presence of 3.5 mg/ml puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 7 d. Finally, we selected a CCD-18CoPOSTN cell line with stable POSTN expression and a

with or without rhPOSTN. Cell proliferation assay was
examined by using cell counting kit-8 (Beyotime, China)
according to the manufacture instruction. Cell invasion
assay was performed using 8-mm pore size 24-well tissue
culture Transwell plates (Corning, NY) as previously
described [39], with the exception that 100 ng/mL
rhPOSTN was added into medium in both chambers in
the experimental group. Anchorage independent growth
potential was evaluated by double-layered soft agarose
culture system. Diluted SW480 and HT29 cells were
seeded into 6-cm culture dishes (1000 cells/dish) and
incubated for 14 to 21 days, respectively. Cell clones in the
dishes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 10 min. The
number of stained clones containing >50 cells was counted
as survivors, and clone formation rate was calculated
with the formula: the number of survivors/1000 × 100%.
All examinations were performed in triplicate.

qRT-PCR
qRT-PCR was firstly applied to measure levels of
POSTN mRNA. The primers for the examination of POSTN
mRNA were 5′-GCACTCTGGGCATCGTGGGA-3′
(forward) and 5′-AATCCAAGTTGTCCCAAGCC-3′
(reverse), for GAPDH (an internal control) were
5′-AAATCCCATCACCATCTTCC-3′ (forward) and
5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (reverse). qRT-PCR
was performed as we previously described [37].

Chemo-resistance of CRC cells to 5-FU

Western blot

SW480 and HT29 were seeded in 96-well
plates (5 × 103/100 μL per well) and cultured with
conditional medium of CCD-18Co-NC, the medium
of CCD-18Co-POSTN, 100 ng/mL rhPOSTON,
and 100 ng/mL rhPOSTON plus 10 μM each of the
2 signaling inhibitors, respectively. The cells allowed
to grow for 24 h and then treated with 5-FU at various
concentrations (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL) for
36 h. Number of viable cells was measured by using
cell counting kit-8 assay. Then, inhibition of viable
cells was calculated according to the inhibition rate, as
previously described [7, 40].

Rabbit monoclonal antibody (mAb) to human
POSTN (1:1000, ab172615, Abcam, UK), mouse mAb
to human Phospho-Akt (Ser473) (587F11) (1:1000,
4051, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), rabbit
polyclonal antibody (pAb) to human Akt (1:1000, 9372,
Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit mAb to human
β-catenin (1:1000, 8480, Cell Signaling Technology)
and rabbit pAb to human GAPDH (1:1000, AP0063,
Bioworld Technology) were applied for Western blot
analysis. Signal intensity of each band was quantified
using Genetools software (version 4.02, Cambridge, UK).
Relative expression was calculated as that signal intensity
of POSTN divided by signal intensity of GAPDH in each
lane as previously described [38].

Proliferation, invasion, and anchorage
independent growth assays of CRC cells

Effects of CRC-derived factors on the
production of POSTN in fibroblasts and
autocrine POSTN on the growth, migration,
invasion, and anchorage independent
growth of fibroblasts

CCD-18Co-POSTN and CCD-18Co-NC were
cultured with FBS-free DMEM for 48 h, respectively.
The supernatants were aseptically filtered and mixed
with 5% FBS as conditional media. SW480 and HT29
were cultured with 100% conditional media of colonic
fibroblasts, complete medium with 100 ng/mL rhPOSTN
(10299-H08H, Sino Biological, Beijing, China), and
complete medium alone, respectively. PI3K/Akt kinase
inhibitor, LY294002 (Selleck, Shanghai, China) at
the final concentration of 10 μM or β-catenin-specific
inhibitor, XAV939 (Selleck, Shanghai, China) at the same
concentration was added into cell cultures to assess if
the effect of rhPOSTN was mediated by these signaling
pathways. The same amount of Dimethyl Sulphoxide,
dissolvant of the inhibitors, was also added to cell cultures

LoVo, SW480, HT29, and RKO were cultured
with serum-free DMEM for 48 h. The supernatants of the
cells were sterile filtered and mixed with FBS at the final
concentration of 10% to make CRC conditional medium,
respectively. The conditional medium of each CRC cell
line was applied to culture CCD-18Co cells. After 7 days’
culture, CCD-18Co cells were harvested and subjected to
exam the expression of POSTN by qRT-PCR and Western
blot. The growth of CCD-18Co in response to RKO
conditional medium as well as cell proliferation, invasion,
and anchorage independent growth assays of CCD-18CoNC and CCD-18Co-POSTN were examined as described
above. Cell migration assay was carried out as the
invasion assay except that the bottom of the culture insert
was not coated with Matrigel. The two inhibitors targeting
