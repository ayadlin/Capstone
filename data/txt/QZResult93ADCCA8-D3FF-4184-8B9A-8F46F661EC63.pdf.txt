rostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy
that affects men in the U.S.. Screening for prostate cancer has
resulted in an increased detection of clinically localized disease and
a recent decrease in overall disease-specific mortality.1,2 Treatments
for localized disease include watchful waiting, radical prostatectomy,
and radiation therapy. Ten-year survival rates in men with localized
disease are favorable; however, unfortunately, survival and treatment
options are more limited once the disease has spread beyond the
prostate. Hormone ablation in the form of surgical or chemical castration remains the standard of care for the initial treatment of metastatic disease. The clinical course of hormone-sensitive metastatic
prostate cancer generally is indolent, and side effects of hormone
ablation are the primary concern. Unfortunately, androgen-independence ultimately develops in most men on long-term hormone
deprivation. In the past, mitoxantrone and prednisone were administered for hormone-refractory disease to alleviate symptoms.
Recently, a survival advantage has been observed with 2 chemotherapy regimens in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer. Both docetaxel plus prednisone and combined docetaxel and
estramustine have demonstrated improved survival compared with
mitoxantrone and prednisone.3,4 Although these new regimens were
the first to improve survival significantly in patients with hormonerefractory prostate cancer (HRPC), the overall survival improvement
was modest at only 2 months.
Given the poor treatment outcomes and survival rates in
patients with advanced HRPC, new strategies are needed to improve
current regimens and to develop novel treatment options. Anticancer therapeutic regimens, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy, may trigger tumor cell death through the

induction of apoptosis. Alterations in apoptotic pathways may induce tumor resistance to current therapeutic regimens. In this review, we focused on
established aberrations of apoptosis in HRPC and
potential treatment strategies to overcome them.

Apoptotic Signaling Pathways
Anticancer therapeutic regimens, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy, may
trigger tumor cell death through the induction of apoptosis. Alterations in apoptotic pathways contribute
to tumor resistance to current therapies. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in
the regulation of apoptosis and how tumor cells
evade apoptotic death may provide insight into the
processes of carcinogenesis and progression of various malignancies, possibly enabling more rational
approaches to antitumor therapies.
Apoptosis is a specific process leading to programmed cell death through the activation of evolutionarily conserved intracellular pathways. Apoptotic
cell death is characterized by a series of unique biochemical and morphologic events, such as cleavage
of multiple proteins, phosphatidyl serine exposure,
cell shrinkage, and condensation and fragmentation

of chromatin. Apoptosis can be initiated through 2
alternative pathways. The extrinsic pathway uses
ligand-induced activation of death receptors, such as
CD95/APO1/Fas, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1
(TNF-R1), or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) death receptors DR4 and DR5 located on a
cell’s surface; and the intrinsic pathway channels
through mitochondrial mechanisms.5–9 Both pathways are regulated by several antiapoptotic and proapoptotic molecules, which are depicted and
referenced in Table 1 and Figure 1.

Mechanisms of Apoptosis Resistance in Prostate Cancer
The nuclear factor jB and B-cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia/lymphoma 2 pathways
Tumor resistance to therapeutic regimens occurs
frequently with androgen-independent prostate cancer. Progression to androgen independence is a
complex process by which cells acquire the ability
to survive in the absence of androgens and to proliferate by using nonandrogenic stimuli for mitogenesis. Multiple in vitro studies have demonstrated
that early response genes related to nuclear factor jB
(NF-jB) contribute to metastatic tumor progression
and development of HRPC. NF-jB regulates the sus-

FIGURE 1. Apoptosis can be initiated through 2 alternative pathways: the extrinsic pathway, which uses ligand-induced activation of death receptors, and the

ceptibility of various cell types to apoptosis through
transcriptional control of antiapoptotic genes, which
act on different levels of the apoptotic pathway.
These include B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/
lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-like 1 (Bcl-XL), and Bfl-1/
A1 (2 members of the Bcl-2 family), which act at the
mitochondrial level10,11; survivin, X-linked inhibitor
of apoptosis (XIAP), cytoplasmic inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (c-IAP1), and c-IAP2, which inhibit the activity of various caspases12–14; and TNF receptorassociated factor 1 (TRAF1), TRAF2, and immediate
early response 3 (IEX-1L), which act upstream in
the apoptotic pathway and are accountable for resistance to TNF-a-mediated apoptosis.14,15 NF-jB

also controls the ratio of TRAIL decoy receptors to
TRAIL death receptors, thereby regulating the sensitivity of cells to TRAIL. Over-expression of antiapoptotic proteins controlled by NF-jB family members
has been implicated as a key element of drug resistance in a wide variety of solid tumors, including
prostate cancer.16–18 Constitutive activation of NFjB in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells
may explain the observation that these cells are
remarkably resistant to therapeutic agents that
induce apoptotic pathways.19 Multiple in vitro studies also have documented that the inhibition of
NF-jB activity enhances the apoptotic effect of a
variety of death inducers,20–22 whereas pretreatment

Apoptosis-Resistant Prostate Cancer/Uzzo et al.

of cells with NF-jB inducers confers resistance
against apoptosis.23,24
Because Bcl-2 family members are of critical importance in the regulation of apoptosis, they have
become a focus for investigators examining apoptosis
resistance in HRPC. Bcl-2 levels increase after androgen withdrawal, which supports the hypothesis that
Bcl-2 expression confers resistance to androgen withdrawal by blocking the usual apoptotic signal from
androgen manipulation. Raffo et al. demonstrated
that the overexpression of Bcl-2 protects prostate
cancer cells from apoptosis in vitro and correlates
with the ability to form hormone-refractory prostate
tumors in vivo.25

The TRAIL pathway
TRAIL is a cytotoxic agent that preferentially
induces apoptosis in a variety of human cancer
cells. The most basic requirement for normal functioning of the death receptor pathways is that the
receptor is expressed on the tumor cell surface to
allow receptor ligand interaction. DR5 is located at
8p21-22, a region that frequently is lost in prostate
cancer,26 resulting in resistance to TRAIL. Expression of soluble receptors that act as decoys for
death ligands by tumor cells also may represent a
potential mechanism to escape immune destruction. Analysis of various prostate cell lines and tissue specimens suggests a strong correlation
between the expression patterns of TRAIL receptors
and TRAIL resistance. In those studies, the presence
of TRAIL decoy receptors on the surface clearly
confirmed TRAIL resistance despite high levels of
TRAIL death receptor expression.27 Similar findings
were reported by Hesry et al., who demonstrated
that the TRAIL decoy receptor DcR2 was significantly more abundant in tumor cells than in nonneoplastic cells.28

Alterative caspase pathways
Alterations in caspase expression reported in prostate
cancer cell lines also have been identified in human
prostate cancer specimens. Winter et al. compared
the levels of caspase-1, caspase-3, and caspase-9
expression in tissue samples from radical prostatectomy specimens with the levels in normal prostatic
tissues retrieved from cystoprostatectomy specimens.
Significant decreases in caspase-1 and caspase-3
expression levels were noted in prostate cancer specimens compared with normal prostatic tissue,
whereas significant increases in Bcl-2 levels were
identified in the prostate cancer samples.29

1663

Epigenetic modifications
Whereas genetic alterations in prostate cancer have
been studied for a long time, the appreciation of epigenetic changes is more recent. Epigenetic changes
alter the expression of tumor suppressor genes without changing the DNA sequence. Promoter methylation is one of the most commonly occurring
epigenetic events effecting cell function. DNA hypermethylation refers to the covalent addition of a
methyl group, which is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes to the 5-carbon of cytosine in a
CpG dinucleotide and is a reversible event, making it
a potential therapeutic target. XIAP-associated factor
1 (XAF1) is a new candidate tumor suppressor that is
known for exerting proapoptotic effects by interfering
with the caspase-inhibiting activity of XIAP. Lee et al.
reported that epigenetic alteration of XAF1 is frequent in human urogenital cancers and may contribute to the malignant progression of tumors by
providing tumor cells with a survival advantage,
potentially through attenuation of the p53 response
to apoptotic stresses.30 Epigenetic alterations of the
death receptor genes can decrease or prevent functional protein expression. Santourlidis et al. analyzed
4 CpG sites in the FAS promoter region that were
predicted to be in the NF-jB binding site and
observed partial hypermethylation in 4 of 32 prostatic tumors. In vitro, the 4 CpG sites examined were
unmethylated in 1 prostate and partially methylated
in 1 metastatic prostate cell line.31
Developing Strategies for the Treatment of HRPC
The mechanisms of apoptosis resistance described
above and the data gathered from prostate cell lines
have shed light on the limitations of the currently
available treatment regimens. Stimulation of the apoptotic pathway is a major contributor to cell death
from many current chemotherapeutic agents (Table
2). Furthermore, multiple alterations are present in
the apoptotic pathways of HRPC cell lines and other
human tumors, providing insight regarding how
these alterations affect the cellular response to chemotherapeutic agents. These findings are leading to
new strategies to enhance the current regimens
(Tables 3 and 4). Ongoing and recent clinical trials
are reviewed by mechanism below.
Bcl-2 family
One method of inhibiting Bcl-2 function is to block
translation by using antisense oligonucleotides.
Knock-down of Bcl-2 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides induced radiosensitization and inhibition of
angiogenesis in human PC-3 prostate tumor xenografts in vivo.32 This strategy formed the basis for a

Phase II study of oblimersen sodium (Genasense,
G3139), a phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide directed to the Bcl-2 mRNA, in combination
with docetaxel in 28 patients with HRPC.33 Overall,
14 of 27 patients in that study had a PSA response, 4
of 12 patients had an objective response, and the
median survival was 19.8 months. Although the overall PSA response rate, response rate, and median survival for combination therapy were comparable to
the results of single-agent studies for docetaxel in
patients with HRPC, no Phase III trials with this
agent in prostate cancer are planned. However, combined suppression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members using an alternative compound could be
an attractive strategy for inhibiting cancer progression through alteration of the apoptotic rheostat in
androgen-independent prostate cancer.34 For example, new small-molecule bcl-2 inhibitors, such as AT101, are emerging with preliminary evidence of activity in many solid tumors.
In another approach, Xiao et al. demonstrated
that oral administration of the garlic constituent diallyl trisulfide suppressed growth of PC-3 prostate
cancer xenografts in vivo. Diallyl trisulfide-mediated
inhibition of PC-3 xenograft growth was accompanied by induction of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bak
and Bax.35 Garlic has been explored in prostate cancer prevention studies, and a relative decreased risk
of prostate cancer was noted in consumers of garlic

in an Asian population, supporting its possible use
as an interesting agent in future studies.36
In summary, initial anti-Bcl-2 approaches have
been attempted in prostate cancer. Although activity
exists in preclinical models, this has not yet translated into clinical activity. Although the basic biologic
reasons for this observation need to be elucidated,
the populations of patients studied to date may not
have been uniform enough from a molecular standpoint to provide insight.

NF-jB
More than 750 inhibitors of the NF-jB pathway have
been identified, including a variety of natural and
synthetic molecules,37 such as antioxidants, peptides,
small RNA/DNA, microbial and viral proteins, small
molecules, and engineered dominant-negative or
constitutively active polypeptides. These molecules
can act as general or specific inhibitors of NF-jB
induction.37 For example, preclinical studies indicate
that the apoptotic efficacy of proteasome inhibition
with bortezomib (PS-341, Velcade) inhibits NF-jB
activity and decreases Bcl-2 levels in several human
cancer cell lines, including androgen-independent
PC-3 prostate cancer cells.38 Chemotherapeutic
agents, including docetaxel, induce NF-jB activation,
impeding apoptotic signaling in cancer cells. Cotreatment with docetaxel and an inhibitor of IjB kinase2, PS-1145, reportedly prevented docetaxel-induced

NF-jB activation and increased the effects of docetaxel on cell viability in PC-3 and DU-145 cells.39
Two Phase I/II studies of bortezomib combined with
docetaxel in patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer also indicated clinical benefit similar to docetaxel alone.40,41 Bortezomib used
alone in castrate metastatic prostate cancer was
inactive.42 A Phase I/II trial of bortezomib alone in
androgen-independent prostate cancer achieved inhibition of its target, 20S proteasome, and demonstrated modest activity (Table 3). Overall, however, to
date, combined and single-agent use of bortezomib
in prostate cancer has not been fruitful clinically.
Recent studies by Choi et al. revealed that apoptosis
induced by D,L-sulforaphane, a synthetic analogue
of cruciferous vegetable-derived isomer l-SFN, in
androgen-independent PC-3 cells was accompanied
by a marked decrease in the levels of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family proteins cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP

and inhibition of NF-jB activation.43 Kikuchi et al.
demonstrated suppression of HRPC by an NF-jB
inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin, in vivo.44
To our knowledge to date, this approach has not been
used in clinical trials.
In preclinical studies, thalidomide and arsenic
trioxide also demonstrated the ability to inhibit NFjB activation. A randomized Phase II trial of docetaxel plus thalidomide in HRPC indicated that combined therapy produced a greater PSA response (53%
vs 37%) and better median progression-free survival
(5.9 months vs 3.7 months for docetaxel alone). At 18
months, the overall survival rate also was improved
(68% vs 43% for docetaxel alone).45
Dandekar et al. investigated the ability of the
cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib to increase the
sensitivity of apoptosis-resistant cells to docetaxel.46
A synergistic increase in the induction of apoptosis
was noted in prostate cancer cells that were treated

with celecoxib and taxotere. The increased response
was associated with increases in caspase-3, caspase9 and Bax, whereas the NF-jB-regulated antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL was decreased significantly. This
and other work have led to at least 6 Phase II celecoxib-based trials in neoadjuvant,47–49 symptomatic,
and advanced HRPC.50–52 Unfortunately, the apparent activity of celecoxib must be balanced by its
potential for harmful cardiovascular sequelae.
Azrak et al. reported the synergistic antitumor
activity of the sequential treatment of C2G prostate
cancer cells with methylselenocysteine and docetaxel. The synergy was associated with induction of
apoptotic cell death, which was associated with caspase-3 activation and down-regulation of survivin, an
NF-jB target.53 It has been reported that small-interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the survivin gene
increased the sensitivity of androgen-independent
DU-145 prostate cancer cells to the Hsp90 inhibitor
17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin.54 On this
basis, a Phase II trial of YM155 (a survivin inhibitor)
in HRPC is ongoing (Table 4).
Thus, Phase II trials using targets of the NF-jB
pathway have been completed by using a variety of
agents. Because none demonstrated activity that
definitely was superior to historic single-agent docetaxel activity, Phase III trials of these combinations
have not been conducted to date, and it remains to
be determined which of the many targets is ideal for

proceeding to a Phase III trial. The order of administration and the patient populations tested may play a
role in signals of efficacy.

Mammalian target of rapamycin
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a
serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell
growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival,
protein synthesis, and transcription. Dysregulation of
the mTOR pathway is implicated as a contributing
factor to various types of cancer, including prostate
malignancy.55 Inhibition of mTOR through the
natural antibiotic rapamycin, which originally was
developed as an immunosuppressant, has been proposed as a therapeutic regimen in tumors such as
prostate malignancies.56 However, experimental resistance to rapamycin and its esterified derivatives
already has been demonstrated through the antiapoptotic effects of Bcl-2 in a mouse model of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia.55 After androgen
withdrawal, as Bcl-2 levels increase, clinical resistance to mTOR inhibitors in hormone-refractory prostate tumors may be expected. Shankar and Srivastava
reported that curcumin, a major chemical component of turmeric, down-regulated the expression of
Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and up-regulated the expression of
Bax and Bak in prostate cancer cells.57 Thus, concomitant treatment with mTOR inhibitors and curcumin may provide promising therapeutic possibilities

for prostate tumor targeting. Moreover, Li et al.
demonstrated that curcumin had anticancer, chemosensitization, and radiosensitization effects in human
prostate cancer models in vitro and in vivo through
the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/
mTOR/ETS2 signaling.58 A Phase II trial of neoadjuvant temsirolimus in patients with Gleason sum 8
and 9 prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy was conducted but has not been published
to date. In addition, a Phase I study is ongoing of
limited androgen ablation and antiandrogen therapy
followed by temsirolimus in patients with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer after prostatectomy
and/or radiotherapy (Table 4).

Death receptors
Apoptosis-resistant prostate cancer cells also have
demonstrated a decreased response to death receptor
ligands. Apo2/TRAIL is a death receptor ligand that
is known to activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway.59 However, Apo2/TRAIL has little effect on stimulating apoptosis in HRPC cell lines. Ng et al.
demonstrated that actinomycin D in combination
with Apo2/Trail synergistically increased the apoptotic response in hormone-refractory cell lines. The
addition of actinomycin D significantly decreased
levels of XIAP, allowing cytochrome c release,
mediated by Apo2/TRAIL, to activate downstream
effector caspases. Lashinger et al. recently reported
on the synergistic activity of TRAIL and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.16 The synergistic increase
in apoptosis was associated with an increase in p21
activity, which was associated with downstream
amplification of the caspase cascade.
Another study on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in
HRPC evaluated the combined effects of TRAIL and
doxorubicin in inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer
cell lines. This combination appeared to enhance cytotoxicity in malignant versus normal prostate cells.60
Anti-TRAIL antibodies currently are being tested in
combination with chemotherapeutic agents but to
our knowledge have not been evaluated to date in
Phase II trials for prostate cancer.
Studies from our laboratory revealed that the selenium metabolite methylseleninic acid (MSA) sensitizes apoptotic-resistant prostate cancer cell lines to
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.61 It was observed that
MSA down-regulated cFLIP, blocked TRAIL-mediated
BAD phosphorylation, and acted synergistically with
TRAIL in activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
Selenium is under evaluation in the Selenium and
Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial and in combination with brachytherapy (Table 4).

Epigenetic modifications
The drug azacitidine, which is known for its effects
on DNA modification, is being investigated both
alone and in combination with docetaxel in patients
with metastatic and nonmetastatic HRPC who have
rapid PSA doubling times. Likewise, vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was evaluated after treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer with
cytotoxic chemotherapy; however, no clinical benefit
was reported, and unexpected grade 3 toxicities were
encountered.62
Conclusions
Androgen-independent prostate cancer is associated with an extremely poor treatment response
and a limited prognosis using current therapeutic
modalities. Recent advances have increased our
understanding of the apoptotic pathways and the
mechanisms of apoptosis resistance observed in
HRPC. Combination therapies with currently available chemotherapeutic regimens and novel agents
and/or with naturally occurring compounds have
proven successful in the induction of apoptosis in
apoptosis-resistant prostate cancer cell lines, but to
our knowledge these combinations have not yet
been proven superior to existing regimens in clinical
trials.
There are several potential reasons why these
agents may not enhance the current activity of single-agent therapies such as docetaxel. First, given
the complexities of pharmacodynamics, the agents
may not be inhibiting the expected target. Moreover,
the target may be irrelevant biologically because of
the redundancy of human cellular systems and competing activating pathways. Second, because of difficulties obtaining tissues in many patients with
prostate cancer, especially those with small-volume,
aggressive primary tumors and those with metastases, there is a lack of data characterizing paired primary and metastatic tumor samples in this disease.
Thus, trials often are forced to resort to alternative
ways of assessing responses, such as measurement
of circulating tumor cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PSA. It is difficult to know whether
these are accurate approaches to assess response.
Finally, given the known heterogeneity of clinical
prostate cancer, the data reflected from in vitro or
in vivo animal studies may not be germane to individual patients, and there remains a great need to
further characterize patient populations using
molecular profiles.
The continued conduct of clinical trials with
attention to measuring target inhibition by an agent,
in addition to clinical parameters such as PSA

response, will be a necessary step in the development of novel strategies that target multiple apoptotic proteins. We hope that these efforts will result in
the ability to overcome apoptosis resistance and in
improvements in existing therapeutic regimens.
