alignant mesothelioma (MM) is a highly aggressive tumor that
arises from the surface serosal cells of the pleura and, less frequently, the peritoneum. The incidence of the disease in the majority of Western nations is expected to steadily rise and peak over the
next 2 decades.1 There is no known curative modality for MM and
long-term survival is rare even with aggressive multimodal therapy.
A strong link has been established between exposure to asbestos
and increased risk for MM.2 Subsequent laboratory research has
confirmed the carcinogenicity of asbestos in mesothelial cell lines
and in animal models. Despite recent restrictions on the use of
asbestos, the incidence of MM is continuing to rise due to the long
latency period for the development of MM after asbestos exposure.
Simian virus 40 (SV40) has also been implicated in the pathogenesis
of MM. SV40 may have synergistic oncogenic effects when combined with asbestos, although the exact role and importance of this
virus in the development of MM is controversial.3 One recent study
demonstrated that significantly lower amounts of asbestos were sufficient to cause MM in animals infected with SV40 compared with
uninfected animals, supporting the possible role of SV40 as a cocarcinogen in this disease.4 Using a novel SV40 large T antigen (Tag)
transgenic model of mesothelioma, Robinson et al.5 also demonstrated that asbestos-induced malignant transformation is SV40
dose-dependent, with higher copy numbers of the transgene
increasing the rate of tumor formation.
Treatment of MM with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy is rarely curative. Clinical trials of single modality treatment
with extrapleural pneumonectomy or pleurectomy, chemotherapy,
or radiation therapy have not shown significant improvement in
survival compared with supportive treatment. Median survival has
ranged from 10–17 months. A multimodal approach, including

surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, is
thought to improve survival in selected patient,
although this remains controversial. Sugarbaker
et al.6 reported a 15% 5-year survival with multimodal therapy and a 25% 5-year survival in patients
who underwent complete surgical resection. Recent
trials of new-generation platinum- and pemetrexedbased regimens have reported encouraging results. In
particular, a Phase III trial of pemetrexed plus cisplatin for MM reported a median survival of 12 months
compared with 9 months after treatment with cisplatin alone.6
Despite these promising results, long-term survival with currently available treatments is rare.
Novel therapies for MM are needed. Improvement in
our understanding of the molecular biology of MM
has already identified promising new therapies and
pathways that are candidates for targeted therapies.
In this review, we focus on the key molecular signaling pathways, including vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), Wnt,
and cell cycle control genes p53, pRb, and bcl2,
which appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of MM.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
VEGF is a potent inducer of angiogenesis and its critical role in tumor progression is well established.7
VEGF-targeted therapy is a promising approach
aimed at inhibiting tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. VEGF up-regulation appears to play an important role in mesothelial cell transformation. High
levels of VEGF have been observed in the serum of
mesothelioma patients compared with the serum of
normal subjects.8,9 Also, elevated pleural effusion
VEGF levels are associated with diminished survival
in patients with MM.10 Similarly, Demirag et al.11
reported that VEGF overexpression on immunohistochemistry (IHC) independently predicts short survival in patients with MM (P ¼ .0002).
Recent reports have suggested that SV40 may
play a role in inducing VEGF expression in MM cells.
One study demonstrated that the SV40 large tumor
antigen (Tag) is involved in VEGF promoter activation and that it potently increases VEGF levels in
several MM cell lines.12 Moreover, transfection of
normal human mesothelial cells with full-length
SV40 DNA resulted in a significant increase of VEGF
levels, suggesting that SV40 may contribute to
increased VEGF production by mesothelial cells.13
Evidence also suggests that interleukin-6 (IL-6), a
cytokine that is frequently overexpressed in MM,
might play a role in the induction of VEGF production. A recent study by Adachi et al.14 demonstrated

1455

that IL-6/IL-6R stimulation increased expression of
VEGF in 80% of MM cell lines and that an anti-IL-6R
antibody inhibited this expression.
In addition to stimulating the neovascularization
essential for tumor growth and metastasis, recent
evidence has demonstrated that VEGF may also act
in a functional autocrine loop capable of directly
stimulating the growth of malignant mesothelioma
cells. Strizzi et al.11 reported that MM cell lines express elevated levels of both VEGF and the VEGF
receptors, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR), compared with normal mesothelial cells. In that study
they found that recombinant VEGF phosphorylated
both Flt-1 and KDR and increased proliferation of all
MM cell lines examined. In contrast, neutralizing
antibodies against VEGF, Flt-1, or KDR significantly
reduced MM cell proliferation. Similar autocrine signaling in MM cells was demonstrated with VEGF-C
and its cognate receptor VEGFR-3.15 Simultaneous
inhibition of VEGF and VEGF-C displayed a synergistic effect in reducing the viability of mesothelioma
cells in vitro.
Interestingly, significant arterial vascularization is
rarely exhibited in MM. Whereas at least 2 studies16,17 reported a significant correlation between
VEGF expression by IHC and intratumoral microvascular and microlymphatic density, other studies
failed to find a correlation.10,11 Strizzi et al.11 proposed that competitive binding of VEGF in favor of
rapidly proliferating MM tumor cells might make
VEGF less available to stimulate the endothelial cells
necessary to promote angiogenesis.
These reports suggest that VEGF may play a key
role in MM tumor progression by regulating both
angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation, thus raising interest in VEGF as a therapeutic target in MM.
Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco,
Calif), a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF, in
combination with cisplatin produces an inhibitory
effect in an in vivo model of human MM. A Phase II
clinical trial of bevacizumab combined with gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with malignant mesothelioma is under way, with encouraging
preliminary results.18 A Phase II clinical trial at the
University of Chicago of SU-5416, a selective inhibitor of VEGF-R2, in patients with MM is also under
way.19

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
The role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
signaling in MM has become an active area of research in large part due to the success of EGFR-targeted therapies in lung cancer. EGFR is a member of
the erbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors, which

1456

CANCER

also includes erbB-2, -3, and -4. Multiple ligands
bind to and activate EGFR, including amphiregulin,
betacellulin, EGF, and transforming growth factor
(TGF)-a. The latter 2 are believed to be the most important ligands for EGFR. Ligand binding with EGFR
leads to receptor dimerization and internalization
followed by autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase domains. This subsequently results in
the activation of signaling pathways that are involved
in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.20
Overexpression of EGFR has been recognized to play
an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of a variety of malignancies, including colon cancer, nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and breast
cancer.
The involvement of EGFR in malignant pleural
mesothelioma was first reported by Dazzi et al.,21
who found expression of the receptor in 68% of fixed
paraffin-embedded MM tissue specimens. A similar
recent study found EGFR immunoreactivity in 55.7%
of MM samples and no immunoreactivity in normal
pleura.22 Both studies found that EFGR expression is
not an independent prognostic factor for patient survival. One recent IHC study of 168 tumor sections
identified EGFR expression in 44% of cases, with
EGFR positivity associated with improved survival
(P ¼ .01).23 The authors suggest that the favorable
prognosis associated with EGFR positivity may be
partly explained by the greater expression of EGFR in
the epithelioid cell type, which is known to have a
better prognosis than the sarcomatoid cell type.
Thus, the correlation between EGFR expression with
improved survival does not negate EGFR as a potential therapeutic target in MM.
Asbestos fibers are involved in the activation of
EGFR in mesothelioma. Pache et al.24 demonstrated
that asbestos fibers cause aggregation and increased
immunoreactivity of the EGFR protein in human
mesothelial cells in vivo and that asbestos-induced
EGFR autophosphorylation may lead to the induction
of the AP-1 family members, c-fos and c-jun.25,26
Crocidolite and erionite asbestos fibers were found
to induce EGFR expression in rat pleural mesothelial
cells.27 Intense patterns of EGFR protein expression
were linked to mesothelial cells phagocytosing longer
asbestos fibers. Previous studies have shown a relation between asbestos fiber length and carcinogenicity.28
It is uncertain whether there is a role for EGFR
inhibitors in the treatment of MM. A recent in vitro
study by Cole et al.29 demonstrated that inhibition
of EGFR signaling with the small molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) PD153035 suppresses MM cell
motility and invasion. Similarly, Janne et al.30 found

that gefitinib (Iressa, AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del),
another EGFR-TKI, significantly inhibits EGFR-dependent cell signaling including AKT phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and
2 in all MM cell lines examined. This resulted in
marked antiproliferative effects of these MM cells
in vitro. In another study, gefitinib increased tumor
responsiveness to radiation therapy in an animal
model of MM.31 Despite the promising in vitro activity of gefitinib in MM cell lines, the recently published Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Phase
II clinical trial of gefitinib treatment in 43 previously
untreated mesothelioma patients found that gefitinib
was not effective in this disease.32 This was in spite
of the fact that 97% of patients displayed EGFR overexpression. Interestingly, a recent study found that
common EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations
conferring sensitivity to gefitinib in lung cancer are
not prevalent in MM.33

p53 and pRB Pathways
Functional inactivation of the p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathways appears to be a critical
requirement in the development of several human
cancers, including lung cancer. These pathways play
key roles in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation.34 The
tumor suppressor protein pRB limits cell proliferation by inhibiting entry into the S-phase of the cell
cycle. Another key tumor suppressor protein, p53,
accumulates and is activated in response to cellular
stresses such as hypoxia, DNA damage, and oncogene activation. Activated p53 initiates transcription
of genes that can lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mutations and deletions the p53 and pRb
tumor suppressor genes occur frequently in many
human cancers. Such mutations, however, are extremely rare in MM, and several studies have demonstrated that pRb35 and p5336 remain genetically intact
in all MM specimens examined. In fact, 1 recent IHC
study37 found overexpression p53 in 81% of patient
mesothelioma samples.
In contrast, 1 of the predominant genetic abnormalities in human MM is homozygous deletion of
the 9p21 region, occurring at a frequency of greater
than 70% in MM cell lines.38 The INK4a/ARF locus
within the 9p21 chromosome band plays a critical
role in the regulation of both the pRb and p53 tumor
suppressor pathways (Fig. 1). This locus encodes 2
distinct proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, translated
from alternatively spliced mRNA. p16INK4a exerts its
tumor suppressive effect by inhibiting the cyclin Ddependent kinases (CDKs), thus preventing CDKmediated hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of
pRB and leading to G1-phase cell cycle arrest.

Molecular Biology of Mesothelioma/Lee et al.

FIGURE 1. The role of the INK4A/ARF locus in the regulation of the pRb
and p53 tumor suppressor pathways.

p14ARF acts by directly binding to and promoting
the degradation of Mdm2, thus leading to the stabilization of p53.39 Therefore, a single mutational event
at the INK4a/ARF locus has the potential to disrupt
both of these 2 key growth control pathways.
Xio et al.40 found deletion of this locus, by fluorescence in situ hybridization, in greater than 70% of
MM. Homozygous deletion of the p16INK4a gene
has been reported in 85% of MM cell lines and in
22% of primary tumor specimens examined.41,42 It
has been suggested that the greater frequency of p16
deletions in MM cell lines than in tumor samples
may be either because 1) this alteration occurs in the
culturing process and is an in vitro phenomenon or
2) the tumor specimens may be contaminated with a
small population of nonmalignant cells making it difficult to detect genetic abnormalities.43 At the protein
level it has been demonstrated that p16INK4A is
abnormally expressed in all cell lines and all primary
MM specimens examined.35 These findings also suggest that epigenetic mechanisms might play a role in
silencing gene expression in cells with an absence of
mutations in the INK4a/ARF locus. Indeed, Wong
et al.44 detected methylation of p16INK4a in 10% of
cell lines and 27% of primary tumors. Treatment of
these methylated MM cell lines with an inhibitor of
DNA methylation (50 -aza-20 deoxycytidine) resulted in
re-expression of the p16INK4a protein. Wong et al.44
hypothesize that methylation of p16INK4a may be a

1457

possible therapeutic target in MM and suggest that
responses to treatment of mesothelioma with the
demethylating agent DHAC in clinical trials may in
part be due to re-expression of p16INK4a. However,
due to the nonspecific actions of demethylating
agents it is difficult to link any specific gene to the
clinical response.
Recent studies have shown loss of p16 to be
associated with poor survival in MM patients. A microarray analysis of 99 MM specimens found homozygous deletion of p16 to be a significant independent
adverse prognostic factor in pleural mesotheliomas,
with a median survival of 10 months for p16-deleted
cases vs 34 months for nondeleted cases (P ¼ .001).45
This is consistent with a prior study by Borczuk
et al.46 that identified loss of p16 immunoreactivity
to be an independent predictor of poor survival in
peritoneal mesotheliomas.
The high frequency of abnormalities in the
INK4A/ARF locus in MM presents an attractive diagnostic marker or target for therapeutic intervention.
It has been proposed that detection of homozygous
deletion of this locus by FISH might be an efficient
approach for improving the cytologic diagnosis of
MM from body cavity effusions.47 Another study48
reported that mice treated with p16INK4a-based adenoviral vector gene therapy demonstrated prolonged
survival and even a potential cure. In MM cell lines
and mouse xenografts, re-expression of p16INK4a
led to cell cycle arrest, inhibition of cell growth, and
apoptosis.49
Similarly, we recently evaluated the potential
therapeutic efficacy of p14ARF expressed in an adenoviral vector (Adp14ARF) in human mesothelioma
cell lines that lack p14ARF expression.50 Overexpression of p14ARF resulted in increased levels of p53
and the p21WAF protein as well as dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Infection with
the Adp14ARF also led to cell cycle arrest, cell growth
inhibition, and apoptotic cell death. p21WAF, a p53
transcriptional target, is the universal cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. p21WAF inhibits cdk-mediated
phosphorylation of pRB, thus leading to cell cycle
arrest at the G1-phase checkpoint. In this way,
p14ARF can affect both the p53 and pRb pathways.
p14ARF gene therapy, by restoring and increasing
p53 activity, might also sensitize mesothelioma cells
to ionized irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents.
In addition to abnormalities in the INK4a/ARF
locus, SV40 is also a key candidate for the disruption
of the p53 and pRb tumor suppressor pathways.
SV40 is a powerful carcinogen that has been shown
to transform human mesothelial cells in vitro and to
induce mesothelioma development in animal mod-

els.3 The SV40 large T antigen (Tag) has been shown
to bind and inactivate both p53 and pRB in human
MM cells.51,52

Wnt Pathway
The Wnt signal transduction pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MM. The Wnt
pathway plays a critical role in cell fate determination, proliferation, and patterning during embryogenesis. Although this signaling is essential for normal
developmental processes, aberrant activation of the
Wnt pathway has been closely associated with tumorigenesis. Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway, via binding of the Wnt ligands to the frizzled
transmembrane receptors, leads to the stabilization
and accumulation of b-catenin in the cytoplasm. bCatenin subsequently becomes translocated into the
cell nucleus, where it interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors to promote the expression of Wntresponsive genes including the oncogenes c-myc and
cyclin D (Fig. 2).
In a recent IHC study using serous effusions and
pleural biopsies, Dai et al.53 found staining of b-catenin confined to the cell membrane in all normal and
reactive nonneoplastic mesothelium. In contrast,
they found reduced membranous staining and markedly increased nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of
b-catenin in 26 of 33 advanced stage and 7 of 9 early
stage MM. These findings are consistent with a similar study54 that found all MM tumors examined to be
positive for cytoplasmic b-catenin and 19% to also
have nuclear b-catenin, whereas no reactive mesothelial hyperplasia samples stained with either cytoplasmic or nuclear b-catenin. These findings strongly
suggest that the Wnt-b-catenin pathway is abnormally activated in MM.
Dysregulation of b-catenin signaling by activating mutations in exon-3 of the b-catenin gene is an
important event in the genesis of several human cancers but this has not been found in MM.54,55 Instead,
it appears that genes more upstream in the Wnt
pathway, including extracellular signaling components, may play a more important role. Our group
previously demonstrated that the Wnt signaling pathway is activated in MM through the overexpression
of disheveled proteins. Additionally, we have recently
found that endogenous extracellular Wnt antagonists,
such as the secreted frizzled related proteins (sFRPs)
and Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (Wif-1), are frequently
down-regulated in MM cell lines and primary
tumors.56,57 A monoclonal antibody or siRNA directed against Wnt-1 and Wnt-2 induced apoptosis in
cancer cells overexpressing Wnt. Furthermore, MM
cells treated with these antibodies displayed down-

regulation of key downstream Wnt signaling effectors
such as disheveled and b-catenin.58,59 These findings
suggest that Wnt-targeted therapies may be useful in
the treatment of MM.

BCL-2 Family
The poor response of MM to conventional therapeutic agents is partly due to this tumor’s resistance to
apoptosis. The bcl-2 family of genes is known to play
a major role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Its
members include both proapoptotic proteins such as
Bax, Bak, and Bad and antiapoptotic proteins such as
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. The proapoptotic Bcl-2
family members are thought to induce apoptosis by
promoting permeability of the mitochondrial membranes. This increased permeability results in the
release of caspase activators such as cytochrome c
and subsequently leads to the activation of downstream caspases that cause cellular demolition and
apoptotic morphology.60 In contrast, antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are thought to block this mitochondrial permeabilization. Bcl-2, in particular, has been
demonstrated to protect neoplastic cells from chemotherapy and radiation-induced apoptosis.61 Additionally, a low bax expression has been linked to
higher resistance to chemotherapy and a poor prognosis in breast carcinoma.62 It has been hypothesized
that by altering the ratio of expression of various
proapoptotic and antiapoptotic bcl-2 family genes,
apoptosis can either be induced or inhibited.63
Expression of bcl-2 is rare in MM, unlike in
tumors such as breast and endometrial adenocarcinomas, which frequently display up-regulation of
bcl-2.64–67 In contrast, elevated levels of Bcl-xL mRNA

Molecular Biology of Mesothelioma/Lee et al.

and protein have been detected in all mesothelioma
cell lines and tumor samples examined.66,68 Interestingly, Narasimhan et al.65 also found expression of
proapoptotic Bax in all 14 of 14 mesothelioma cell
lines, including those that were highly resistant to
proapoptotic stimuli. This suggests that overexpression
of Bcl-xL may be necessary to counteract the proapoptotic effect of Bax. Because uniform Bcl-xL overexpression in malignant mesothelioma could account for
resistance to apoptosis even in the presence of wildtype p53, Bcl-xL may be a possible oncogenic candidate in this tumor type.
Pharmacologic inhibition of Bcl-xL expression by
exposure to a histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium
butyrate (NaB), has been shown to lead to apoptotic
cell death in malignant mesothelioma.69 Antisense
oligonucleotides targeting the bcl-xL gene product
have been shown to similarly facilitate apoptosis in
mesothelioma.68,70 Additionally, a recombinant adenoviral vector that can transduce human cells with
the proapoptotic bax gene has been shown to effectively induce apoptosis in mesothelioma.71 Inhibition
of bcl-xL displayed a synergistic effect when combined with the adenoviral proapoptotic gene therapy
vectors AdBak and AdBax.63
Of interest, 1 recent study found that long-term
recurrent exposure to asbestos affects human immune
cells, leading to Bcl-2 enhancement in CD4þ lymphocytes in vitro.72 The same study found Bcl-2 expression in CD4þ peripheral blood lymphocytes to be
significantly increased in MM patients compared with
healthy volunteers (P ¼ .0153) and asbestosis patients
with no signs of malignancy (P ¼ .129). The clinical
significance of this increased Bcl-2 expression remains
to be addressed.
Further investigation on the role of the bcl-2
family members in the pathogenesis of MM, especially in relation to improved therapeutic strategies,
is needed.

Conclusion
Over the past decade there have been significant
advances in our understanding of the molecular
pathways involved in MM carcinogenesis. It is likely
that the implementation of high-throughput proteomic and genomic technologies such as microarray
analysis will further accelerate research in this field.
Despite this continuing progress in our understanding of the biology of MM, progress in treatment of
this fatal tumor has been slow and challenging, with
most treatments having no survival advantage over
palliative care.
Perhaps the greatest and most crucial challenge
now is to translate our growing knowledge of MM

1459

pathogenesis into more effective ways to treat this
devastating disease. MM is a complex tumor that
results from accumulation over many years of multiple genetic alterations, many of which remain to be
uncovered. Thus, it is overly simplistic to expect that
any single ‘‘magic bullet’’ may reverse the malignant
phenotype. Rather, elucidating the several key pathways involved will hopefully result in a rational treatment in which several molecularly targeted agents
will be combined with effective chemotherapeutic
regimes. Early diagnosis in high-risk populations
might also be a desirable goal as treatment effectiveness has been shown to be much greater the earlier
the clinical stage of the tumor at diagnosis. Timely
integration of laboratory-based studies into standard
clinical practice will require continued cooperation
between basic scientists and clinical investigators
working toward improved survival and quality of life
in patients with this aggressive and fatal disease.
