Abstract
Low doses of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) mediate antiangiogenic and immunostimulatory
effects, leading to potent tumoricidal activity in association with various immunotherapeutic strategies. Here,
we show in rodents and cancer patients that CTX markedly promotes the differentiation of CD4þ T helper 17
(Th17) cells that can be recovered in both blood and tumor beds. However, CTX does not convert regulatory T
cells into Th17 cells. Because Th17 are potent inducers of tissue inflammation and autoimmunity, these results
suggest impact on the clinical management of various types of malignancies treated with alkylating agents and a
potential need to optimize CTX-based immunotherapy in patients. Cancer Res; 71(3); 661–5. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Cyclophosphamide (CTX) at 100 to 150 mg/kg dose in mice
is known for decades to suppress inhibitory T-cell subsets
promoting delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses,
IFNg-mediated antitumor T-cell immunity synergizing with
anticancer vaccines, TLR agonists or adoptive T-cell transfer
(1, 2). The production of CTX-induced IFNa might account for
the augmented antibody responses and the persistence of
memory T cells (3). Interestingly, CTX can also ablate a subset
of dendritic cells involved in peripheral tolerance, thereby
contributing to enhanced T helper 17 (Th1) responses and
antitumor effects (4). Pioneering pilot studies indicated that
CTX alone or combined with vaccines could restore natural
killer (NK) and T-cell receptor (TCR)-driven effector functions
in end-stage cancer patients (5), augment DTH responses (6),
decrease the proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs; ref. 5),
and prolong survival of metastatic cancer patients (7).

Recent preclinical studies indicated a close association
between interleukin (IL)-17 produced by tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL) and tumor destruction (8–10). IL-17A–
deficient mice exhibited accelerated tumor progression correlating with decreased NK- and tumor-specific T-cell IFNg
release (8) or enhanced establishment of lung metastases in a
melanoma model (10). The adoptively transferred, antigenspecific Th17 CD4þ T cells evolved into IFNg-producing Th1like lymphocytes capable of eliminating large tumor burdens
(9) or behave as helper cells generating potent CTL responses
(10).
Given the plasticity of Th17 cells (11) and the unstable
phenotype of inducible Tregs (12), we addressed whether CTX
could exert significant effects on these in-transit lymphocytes
subsets. We found that at a low or lymphodepleting dosage in
mice and metronomic in humans, CTX promoted the differentiation of Th17 cells in cancer patients that could be
recovered in blood and tumor ascites. Animal models suggested that CTX-induced Th17 differentiation did not result
from the conversion of Tregs.

Material and Methods
Mice
C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice were obtained from Harlan Laboratories. Foxp3DTR mice [DT receptor–enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the Foxp3 promoter;
ref. (13] were bred in the local animal facility at our institution
in pathogen-free conditions. Animals were used between 9
and 14 weeks of age. All animal experiments were carried out
in compliance with French and European laws and regulations.
Phase I clinical trial IMAIL-2

each patient. Patients’ baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. During this trial, serial blood sampling was
carried out for immunomonitoring, but we focused here on
pre- versus post-CTX therapy. PBMCs were isolated on a Ficoll
gradient and frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis for phenotyping and functions.
Reagents
Cyclophosphamide (Endoxan; Baxter) was provided by
Institut de Cancerologie Gustave Roussy. Anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were purchased from BD Pharmingen
and eBioscience. LIVE/DEAD fixable violet stain fluorescence
for viability staining was purchased from Invitrogen/Molecular Probes. Anti-human mAbs were purchased from BD Pharmingen and Beckman Coulter. All cells were analyzed on a
Cyan flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) with FloJo (Tree Star)
software.
Cytokine assays
CD4þ and CD8aþ T cells were indirectly magnetically
sorted (Miltenyi Biotec) from spleens. A total of 2  105 cells

per well were incubated in MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) precoated
with anti-CD3a mAb (0.5 mg per well; eBioscience) and/or
anti-CD28 mAb (2 mg/mL; BD Pharmingen) and/or rIL-1b and
rIL-23 (10 ng/mL; R&D Systems). The supernatants were
assayed at 48 hours by ELISA for mouse IL-17A (eBioscience)
or IFNg ( (BD OptEIA) . CD4þCD25þFoxp3GFPþ T cells and
CD4þFoxp3GFP T cells were isolated from 2 or 3 pooled
spleens from Foxp3DTR mice by MoFlo- or BD FACSVantage–
mediated sorting. Human bulk peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) were cultured at 1  105 CD3þ T cells per well in
U-bottom 96-well plates with 1  104 anti-CD3/anti-CD28–
coated microbeads (Invitrogen/Dynal) and 10 IU of rIL-2/mL
(Proleukine). CD4þ and CD8þ T cells were isolated by MoFlomediated sorting from PBMCs or ascites fluids and incubated
at a ratio of 10 cells for 1 anti-CD3/anti-CD28 microbead (with
10 IU of rIL-2/mL) The supernatants were assayed at day 3 by
ELISA for human IL-17 (R&D Systems) or IFNg (BD OptEIA).

Results and Discussion
At 100 mg/kg, CTX blocked the growth kinetics of subcutaneous B16F10 (not shown) in a T-cell–dependent manner (1, 2). We examined more closely the phenotype of T cells
during CTX therapy. A single injection of 100 mg/kg of CTX
resulted, by 7 days, in a 50% reduction in the spleen
cellularity, including B, CD4þ T, and CD8þ T cells
(Fig. 1A), but no significant modulations of the proportions
of the CD4þ, CD8þ, and gd T-cell subsets (not shown). Seven
days post-CTX therapy, the TCR-driven cytokine release was
markedly increased in melanoma-bearing mice (Fig. 1B) in
spleens (but not in draining lymph nodes, not shown). While
IFNg production was increased both in CD4þ and CD8þ T
cells by CTX (Supplementary Fig. 2), CTX-driven IL-17
release increased specifically in CD4þ T cells (Fig. 1C). In
similar conditions, CTX did not significantly induce IL-17
production by CD8þ (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, both low (10
mg/kg causing only a slight decrease in the B-cell count) and
high (200 mg/kg causing profound lymphopenia) dosings of
CTX were associated with such a Th17 pattern (Fig. 1D).
Importantly, CTX also induced Th17 cells in naive (tumorfree) mice, suggesting that this drug does promote the
conversion of naive CD4þ into IL-17–polarized CD4þ T cells
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Recent studies showed that regulatory Foxp3-expressing CD4þ T cells (Tregs) could secrete IL17 (14–17). Taking advantage of the Foxp3DTR mouse model,
we clearly showed that Tregs failed to differentiate into IL17–producing cells whereas conventional T cells (Foxp3
negative) did after CTX treatment (Fig. 2). Therefore, the
major source of IL-17 at day 7 postinjection of CTX in
spleens is the CD4þ T-cell pool.
To further elucidate whether metronomic dosage of the
alkylating agent CTX may also convert CD4þ T cells into Th17
producers in humans, we analyzed the secretory pattern of T
lymphocytes prior to and after a 21-day therapy with 50 mg/d
of oral CTX in a cohort of 21 advanced cancer patients
(Table 1). This metronomic dosage in cancer patients promoted a drop in B-cell counts (but no significant decrease
in T-cell absolute numbers; Fig. 3A). All except 2 patients

exhibited a 2- to 10-fold increase in IL-17 production by T
lymphocytes after TCR cross-linking, as measured by ELISA
(Fig. 3B, left). Although the proportions of both CD4þ and
CD8þ T cells producing IFNg tend to increase following CTX
(not shown), the amount of IFNg produced by TCR-driven
lymphocytes did not significantly augment with CTX after 72
hours of stimulation (Fig. 3B, right). Cell sorting allowing
positive separation of various T-cell subsets, followed by
TCR cross-linking, led to the identification of CD4þ T cells
as the major source of IL-17A (Fig. 3C, left). In contrast, CTX
did not significantly modulate IFNg secretion by CD4þ T cells
after 72 hours of stimulation (Fig. 3C, right). Interestingly, the
pool of IL-17–positive CD4þ T cells failed to coproduce IFNg
(not shown). Here, we report a case of FIGO IIIc ovarian
cancer presenting with ascites and treated with metronomic
CTX together with anti-VEGF antibodies for 2 months. The
comparative analysis of TCR-driven IL-17 secretion by ascites
fluid–derived CD4þ T cells revealed that CTX significantly
enhanced IL-17 at days 16 and 54 and IFNg production at
day 54 by these TILs, thus also induced Th1 cells at tumor site
in patients. Interestingly, the increase of IL-17 was accompanied by a transient decrease in IL-6 secretion (Fig. 3D)
known to favor tumor proliferation and survival (18).

Altogether, these data indicate that CTX can directly or
indirectly increase the pool of Th17 cells in cancer-bearing
hosts. It remains to be established whether mafosfamide,
the active pharmacologic compound derived from the prodrug CTX, could directly promote the proliferation of prepolarized RORgTþ CD4þ T cells or act indirectly by favoring
mechanisms involved in Th17 differentiation. Both the

and inflammatory cytokines (such as TGF-b1, IL-6, and
IL-23) and the TRAIL-mediated tumor cell death triggered
by CTX (1) could induce Nlrp3 activation in inflammatory
phagocytes leading to IL-1b release (19), hence contributing
to the Th17 polarization of tumor-specific CD4þ TILs.

pathway did not antagonize the CTX-mediated tumoricidal activity (data not shown). However, further studies
will be needed to validate that CTX-driven Th17 producers play a beneficial or a deleterious role in tumor
immunosurveillance, as suggested by previous reports
(8, 9, 20). In such a case, CTX might be considered as a
drug modulating the tumor microenvironment (decreasing
Treg suppressors while favoring Th17 inflammatory cells
and Th1 cells) without exerting a major, direct tumoricidal
activity (18).
