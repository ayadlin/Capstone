ABSTRACT
Epidemiologic and systematic studies have indicated that flavonoid consumption
is associated with a lower incidence of breast cancer. Baicalein is the primary
flavonoid derived from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. In the current study,
the long-term exposure of breast epithelial cells to 17β-estradiol (E2) was used to
investigate the chemopreventive potential of baicalein on neoplastic transformation.
The results demonstrated that baicalein significantly inhibited E2-induced cell growth,
motility, and invasiveness, and suppressed E2-induced misshapen acini formation in
3D cultures. Furthermore, it inhibited the ability of E2-induced cells to form clones
in agarose and tumors in NOD/SCID immunodeficient mice. Docking studies using
Sybyl-X 1.2 software showed that baicalein could bind to both estrogen receptor-α
(ERa) and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30), which are two critical
E2-mediated pathways. Baicalein prevented the E2-induced ERa-mediated activation
of nuclear transcriptional signaling by interfering with the trafficking of ERa into the
nucleus and subsequent binding to estrogen response elements, thereby decreasing
the mRNA levels of ERa target genes. It also inhibited E2-induced GPR30-mediated
signal transduction, as well as the transcription of GPR30-regulated genes. Therefore,
these results suggest that baicalein is a potential drug for reducing the risk of
estrogen-dependent breast cancer.

long-term exposure to estrogen induces transformation
phenotypes and genomic changes in breast epithelial
cells including high invasiveness, loss of the ability to
form organized and growth-arrested spheroid acini, and
ultimately a modified glandular architecture and biological
characteristics in developing primary breast cancers [4,
5]. Two different but complementary estrogen pathways
have been identified. Oxidative metabolites of estrogen
and estrogen receptor-mediated genomic and nongenomic
signal transduction contribute to the carcinogenicity of
estrogen, and thus could initiate, promote, or progress
breast cancer [6]. Therefore, blocking the function
of estrogen receptors and reducing its synthesis or
metabolism may have implications for the development of

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in women; it accounts for 29% of all new cancer
diagnoses in women globally [1]. Although breast cancer
prevention has received less attention than treatment, the
primary prevention strategies including maintaining a
healthy body weight, regular physical activity, moderating
the alcohol intake, and chemoprevention have been
identified and applied [2]. A lifetime of exposure to
elevated levels of endogenous or exogenous estrogen is a
key risk factor in the occurrence of breast cancer [3]. The

cancer.
The biological actions of estrogens are mainly
mediated by binding to and activating the classical
estrogen receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ, which belong
to the nuclear receptor superfamily [7]. In the classical
pathway, ERα acts as a ligand-activated transcription
factor, undergoes conformational changes, unbinds from
heat shock proteins, and forms homo- or heterodimers. The
dimer then translocates to the cell nucleus where it binds
to the estrogen response elements (EREs), either directly
or indirectly via transcription factors, and regulates the
expression of estrogen-responsive genes [8]. ERα is
expressed in 50–80% of breast tumors and its expression
is a good indicator for anti-estrogen endocrine therapy [9].
However, some ERα-positive patients do not respond to
endocrine therapy, and some ERα-negative breast cancer
cells remain estrogen-responsive. This suggests the
existence of an alternative receptor for estrogen.
G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30,
formerly known as GPER) is another estrogen-responsive
receptor that functions independently of ERα. It activates
both rapid non-genomic signaling and transcriptional
events. GPR30 mediates estrogen responses via a
mechanism involving activating the non-receptor tyrosine
kinase SRC by the Gβγ subunit, which stimulates matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) to release the active mature
form of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HBEGF) from membrane-bound pro-HB-EGF. Subsequently,
the HB-EGF transactivates the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and the downstream extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and serine/threonine
kinase AKT though the serine-threonine kinase RAF
and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), respectively.
Both ERK and AKT ultimately regulate the expression
of target genes including FOS, JUN, EGR1, CTGF, and
ATF3 [10].
Epidemiologic studies and systematic analyses
have suggested that flavonoids exhibit promising
results in chemoprevention and therapy for breast
cancer [11]. Some studies have attributed the striking
differences in the incidence of breast cancer between
Asian and western women to dietary flavonoids intake
[12]. Nevertheless, the association between dietary
flavonoid intake and the risk of breast cancer remains
controversial. However, Chang et al. demonstrated
that the intake of flavonols and flavones, but not other
flavonoid subclasses or total flavonoids, is associated
with a decreased risk of breast cancer, especially among
post-menopausal women [13].
Baicalein is the primary flavone derived from
Radix Scutellariae, the traditional Chinese medicinal
herb Huang Qin; it bears the three-ring structure of the
flavone backbone with phenolic hydroxyl groups at the 5′,
6′, and 7′ positions (Figure 1D). It possesses a remarkable
spectrum of pharmacological activities and extensive

antitumor properties. It exerts potential effects on the
treatment of breast cancer via complicated mechanisms
including inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and
inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [14].
It was shown that flavonoids contain a polyphenolic
ring that is structurally similar to the steroid nucleus
of 17β-estradiol (E2), and they may exhibit estrogenic
or anti-estrogenic activity [15]. Previous studies found
that baicalein inhibits E2-induced ER transactivation in
MCF-7 cells and displaces >85% of estradiol binding in
mouse uterine cytosol [16, 17]. Furthermore, we recently
demonstrated that baicalein suppresses the E2-induced
migration, adhesion, and invasion of breast cancer cells
by disrupting GPR30 signaling in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3
breast cancer cells [18]. Taken together, these studies
suggest that baicalein may exert anti-estrogenic activity
and interfere with E2-induced ERα and GPR30 signaling
transduction.
The present study investigated the ability of
baicalein to prevent the E2 long-term exposure-induced
transformation of non-tumorigenic MCF-12A and MCF10A mammary epithelial cells using in vitro and in vivo
models. Furthermore, the ability of baicalein to inhibit E2induced ERα and GPR30 signaling activation in these cells
was discussed. The chemopreventive effects of baicalein
on E2-induced normal epithelial cell transformation and
its inhibitory effects on the two estrogen receptors may
provide a novel, promising approach toward breast cancer
prevention.

RESULTS
Baicalein inhibits E2-enhanced cell growth,
migration, and invasion in mammary
epithelial cells
Since long-term exposure of E2 leads to the
neoplastic transformation of human breast epithelial
cells, the current study assessed the protective effects of
baicalein by continuously treating non-tumorigenic MCF12A and MCF-10A cells with E2 (20 nM) with or without
baicalein (2, 4, or 8 μM) for 5 weeks. These concentrations
of baicalein used in the experiments did not cause toxicity
in the two cells (data not shown). Then, cell growth was
examined on four consecutive days using trypan blue dye
exclusion assay. Both cell lines grew faster than controls
after treatment with E2. But baicalein inhibited E2promoted cell growth (Figure 1A). Additionally, treatment
with baicalein at 8 μM alone did not cause significant
difference of the cell growth compared with control.
Specifically, treatment with E2 for 5 weeks also elicited
a significantly higher migration capacity in MCF-10A and
MCF-12A cells; however, baicalein treatment caused a
clear reduction in the width of the wound healing compared
with E2 (Figure 1B). Next, transwell chamber assays were

used to test the ability of MCF-12A and MCF-10A cells
to invade through Matrigel-coated filters after treatment
with E2 or E2 plus baicalein. The results showed that the
invasive capability of both cell lines increased markedly
when exposed to E2 for 5 weeks. However, baicalein
significantly reduced the number of cells that crossed the
Matrigel-coated filters compared with E2 (Figure 1C).

development process includes the initial proliferation of
a single cell, the deposition of the basement membrane,
and differentiation into two populations during the early
stages of morphogenesis (a well-polarized outer layer and
a poorly polarized inner layer). Then, the non-polarized
inner cells began to die by apoptosis, which coincides with
the formation of a hollow lumen [20].
Therefore, this model was used to further analyze
the effects of baicalein on the E2-induced transformation
of mammary epithelial cells. After the indicated treatment
for 5 weeks, cells were seeded in Matrigel and observed
at 0, 4, 8, and 12 days to follow the development of
acinar structures in a basement membrane gel. Cells in
all groups were seeded as single cells (Figure 2). On the
fourth day after plating, the acini remained small, and the
two-layer organization was not observed; there were no
clear differences between groups. By 8 days in culture,
the acini were larger in size. Those in the control groups
were rounded and well-organized, and had differentiated

Baicalein protects E2-disrupted acini grown in
3D cultures
Human mammary epithelial cells cultured in
reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) form
differentiated acini that resemble the acinar structures
of mammary lobules [19]. This 3D epithelial culture
model provides the appropriate structural and functional
context for studying the features of the breast epithelium
in vivo, as well as the features of malignant transformation
and breast cancer [4]. Previous studies showed that the

into two populations. However, the acini derived from E2treated cells differed from controls since they exhibited an
irregular spheroid shape and the two-layer organization
was unclear. In contrast, the shape of acini was rounded
and the two layers were visible in cells co-cultured with
baicalein and E2; the acini disruption caused by E2 was
reversed in the presence of baicalein. Finally, normal MCF12A and MCF-10A cells that had been cultured for 12 days
formed organized spheroid acini with hollow lumens.
Conversely, the acinar structures formed by E2-treated
cells were severely misshapen: they formed a disorganized
acinar morphology with a filled lumen, and some formed
complex multi-acinar structures. The distorted morphology
of the acinar structures suggested excessive proliferation
and indicated that the cells had escaped the normal
phenotypic proliferative arrest that is characteristic of
acinar development. Cells treated with the combination of
E2 and baicalein exhibited normal structural features, with
a spheroid shape and luminal clearing, yielding structures
that resembled the control acini in many ways.

colony formation in soft agar (Figure 3A), which is a typical
feature of cancer cells. However, the colony number and
colony size were significantly reduced in MCF-12A and
MCF-10A cells treated with E2 plus baicalein compared
with E2 alone. Moreover, treatment with baicalein at 8 μM
alone did not change the clone formation ability of the two
cells compared with control. Based on these in vitro results,
we next tested the inhibitory effects of baicalein on E2induced tumorigenic ability in vivo. MCF-12A or MCF10A cells were treated with E2 or E2 plus baicalein for 10
weeks, mixed with Matrigel at a volumetric ratio of 1:1,
and injected into the mammary fat pads of female NOD/
SCID mice (50 μl containing 2 × 106 cells). The growth of
these cells in vivo was monitored every other day for 30
days. As shown in Figure 3B, the MCF-12A and MCF-10A
tumor volume in the control groups reduced gradually, and
no colonies were observed after 30 days. E2-treated MCF12A or MCF-10A cells formed colonies in the mammary
fat pads after 30 days. However, the cells treated with E2
and baicalein (8 μM) were unable to form colonies or grow
in mammary fat pads.

cell lines treated with E2 showed a significant increase in

the potential affinity of E2 and baicalein for the Ligand
binding domains (LBDs) of ERα and GPR30 (Figure 4).
When E2 was docked in the LBD of ERα (Figure 4A(a)
and 4A(b)), three hydrogen bonds formed with Glu
353, Leu 349, and Arg 394 sites. Baicalein also formed
hydrogen bonds in the ERα LBD with Glu 353, Leu 387,
Leu 346, and Arg 394 sites (Figure 4A(a) and 4A(c)).
In the GPR30 model, E2 bound to the GPR30 LBD by
forming hydrogen bonds with His 197, Asp 202, and Glu
218 sites (Figure 4B(a) and 4B(b)). And baicalein was
formed hydrogen bonds with His 282, Asp 202, and His
200 in the LBD of GPR30 (Figure 4B(a) and 4(c)).

the amount of ERα in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic
protein β-actin and the nuclear protein lamin B were
used as loading controls and to confirm lysate purity.
Next, immunostaining and confocal microscopy were
used to confirm the effects of baicalein on the subcellular
localization of ERα in MCF-12A cells that had been
treated with E2. Under serum-free conditions, ERα was
present mainly in the cytoplasm. However, treatment with
E2 resulted in the obvious nuclear localization of ERα; the
nuclear localization of ERα was inhibited in the presence
of baicalein (Figure 5B).
The effects of estrogen on gene expression in
mammary cells are mediated by the interaction between
the ERα and EREs in target DNA. To investigate whether
baicalein influences E2-induced ERα-ERE complex
formation, EMSAs were performed with nuclear extracts
isolated from cells and oligonucleotides containing
the consensus EREs (“GGTCA” and “TGACC”) [21].
When the probes were incubated with nuclear extracts,
significant ERα-EREs complex formation was observed
in extracts from E2-treated cells. However, the intensity
of the band decreased with concurrent baicalein treatment
(Figure 5C). Unlabeled wild-type ERE oligonucleotide
(cold probe), but not a mutant ERE oligonucleotide,
competed for binding in the ERα complex. Furthermore, a
specific anti-ERα antibody was used to form a supershifted
complex, confirming that the complex contained ERα.

Baicalein inhibits E2-induced ERα nuclear
translocation and transcriptional activity
After pre-incubation in serum-free medium for 24
h and followed by treatment with E2 or E2 plus baicalein
under the same condition for 24 h, the intracellular
localization of ERα was analyzed in subcellular protein
fractions from MCF-12A cells. ERα was observed in
the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in control.
When treatment with E2, the nuclear abundance of
ERα increased significantly, whereas the amount of
cytoplasmic ERα decreased significantly (Figure 5A). In
contrast, baicalein significantly decreased the E2-induced
nuclear translocation of ERα. Baicalein also reduced

cells. Data are shown as means ± SEM (n = 3). *P < 0.05 vs. E2, #P < 0.05 vs. control. B. Cells (2 × 106 in 50 μl Matrigel) were implanted

Finally, we investigated whether baicalein modulates the
expression of ERα-regulated estrogen-responsive genes,
including pS2 and CYCLIN D1, [22–24]. As shown in
Figure 5D, the E2-induced upregulation of pS2 and
CYCLIN D1 was significantly inhibited in the presence
of baicalein.

EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr 1173; however, EGFR
phosphorylation was decreased in the presence of
baicalein (Figure 6A). Similarly, the E2-induced
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT at Thr 202/Tyr 204
and Ser 473, respectively, was suppressed by co-treatment
with baicalein. Meanwhile, the EGFR activation induced
by EGF in MCF-12A and MCF-10A cells was prevented
in the presence of baicalein (Figure 6B). The non-receptor
tyrosine kinase SRC is required for the cascades of GPR30
signal transduction [27]. The phosphorylation at Tyr 416
in the activation loop of the SRC kinase domain indicates
the increased enzyme activity [28]. Accordingly, the
phosphorylation of SRC at Tyr 416 triggered by E2 was
also inhibited by baicalein (Figure 6C), hence confirming
its inhibitory activity on GPR30-mediated signaling.
Furthermore, the E2-induced upregulation of c-FOS,
CTGF, CYR61, and EGR1 in MCF-10A cells and c-FOS
and CYR61 in MCF-12A cells was also suppressed by the
presence of baicalein (Figure 6D).

Baicalein prevents E2-induced GPR30-mediated
signal transduction and gene expression
The cells were pre-incubated with serum-free
medium for 24 h, and were then treated with E2 or E2
plus baicalein under the same condition for 1 h. GPR30
expression was unchanged by exposure to E2 with or
without baicalein in both MCF-12A and MCF-10A
cells (Figure 5A). This suggests that E2 and baicalein
do not directly influence GPR30 expression. Previous
studies suggested that GPR30 activation triggers the
MMP-dependent transactivation of EGFR, as well as the
activation of ERK and AKT [25]. GPR30 also triggers
transcriptional responses to upregulate the expression
of its target genes including c-FOS, EGR1, CYR61, and
CTGF [26]. Thus, we next evaluated whether baicalein
inhibits GPR30-mediated signal transduction and
gene expression. E2 treatment significantly increased

DISCUSSION
Advances in the diagnosis, surgical treatment,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have reduced the breast
cancer-associated mortality in the past 20 years [29].

However, the incidence of breast cancer has increased
steadily, even in many Asian countries where the incidence
of breast cancer is traditionally low [2]. It is estimated that
more than half of all breast cancers could be prevented by
healthy behavior and chemoprevention [2]. Thus, reducing
the incidence of breast cancer requires the development of
more effective methods for prevention.

Human breast cancer development is often
characterized by an early stage involving the
transformation of normal breast epithelial cells into mutant
cells. These cells then become transformed into benign
tumor cells, which subsequently progress into malignant
cells. Under prolonged estrogen stimulation, breast
epithelial cells have been confirmed to go transformation

and tumorigenesis [30]. The current experimental also
revealed that the long-term treatment of MCF-12A
and MCF-10A cells with E2 resulted in an accelerated
growth ability, increased motility and invasiveness, and
the formation of misshapen acini with filled lumen in
Matrigel, which together resemble the events that occur
during the early stages of breast cancer in humans [31].
Moreover, E2-treated cells were able to form colonies
in agarose and tumors when injected into NOD/SCID
immunodeficient mice with Matrigel, both of which
are potentially indicative of a cancerous phenotype.
Nevertheless, when the cells were co-treated with E2
and baicalein, the cells exhibited decreased growth, a
reduced migration and invasion ability compared with E2treated cells, and formed 3D duct-like structures similar
to control cells. The cells also did not have the potential
to form colonies and tumors. These results suggest that
baicalein can interfere with the E2-induced neoplastic
transformation of the breast epithelium. Therefore,
baicalein could be a potential chemopreventive agent
against the transformation of a normal cell into a tumor
cell during breast cancer initiation.
The association between breast cancer and ERs
is very well known. Altered ERs signaling has been
implicated in abnormal cell proliferation, as well as the
carcinogenesis and progression of breast cancer [32].
In particular, ERα stimulates cell proliferation and the

mutations arising from the replicative errors that occur
during pre-mitotic DNA synthesis in estrogen-mediated
carcinogenesis [33]. The selective ERα modulator
tamoxifen is used to reduce the incidence of both invasive
and non-invasive breast cancer in women at high risk
for the disease [34]. A previous study demonstrated that
baicalein suppresses E2-induced ERα transactivation in
MCF-7 cells [16]. The current study demonstrated that
baicalein interferes with the nuclear transcription function
of ERα by impeding the E2-induced nuclear localization
of ERα and subsequent binding to EREs containing
“GGTCA” and “TGACC”. Baicalein also suppressed the
E2-enhanced transcription of pS2 and CYCLIN D1, which
are two well-established ERα target genes [35] [36]. It was
indicated that baicalein interferes with E2-induced ERα
signaling activation.
Accumulating evidence has suggested that various
anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen, raloxifen, and fulvestrant
(ICI 182.780) function as GPR30 agonists, similar to E2,
which in turn leads to cancer cell proliferation, migration,
and invasion [37]. Recent literature has revealed that
GPR30 is involved in the development of tamoxifen
resistance [38] and that it correlates with clinical and
pathological biomarkers of poor outcome in breast
cancer [39]. Notably, GPR30 contributes E2-induced
proliferation in breast epithelial cells and both normal and
tumorigenic human breast tissue explants [27]. GPR30

is also overexpressed in invasive breast cancer, and its
expression is positively correlated with the development
of distant metastases [39, 40]. Additionally, GPR30
knockout MMTV-PyMT mice exhibit less aggressive
tumors and fewer metastases [27]. Therefore, GPR30
signaling seems to be an additional mechanism that
maintains the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to E2,
thereby facilitating tumor progression and antiestrogen
resistance. Targeting both ERα and GPR30 may be a
rational pharmacological strategy for the treatment of
breast cancer.
The current results demonstrated that baicalein
significantly suppressed the E2-induced phosphorylation
of SRC at Tyr 416, EGFR at Tyr 1173, ERK1/2 at Thr 202/
Tyr 204, and Akt at Ser 473 in both MCF-10A and MCF12A cells, a mechanism that was described previously for
the activation of GPR30 signaling [41, 42]. Meanwhile,
baicalein inhibits E2-induced GPR30-mediated target gene
expression by preventing E2-enhanced c-FOS, CTGF,
EGR1, and CYR61 mRNA levels [26]. Taken together,
these results suggest that baicalein exerts dual inhibitory
effects on E2-mediated ERα and GPR30 signaling. In the
present study, molecular modeling was used to assess
whether baicalein binds to ERα and GPR30. However,
it remains unclear whether baicalein could act as an
antagonist of both receptors and the detailed mechanisms
by which baicalein influences the downstream signaling
need to be addressed. Furthermore, the possible existence
of cross-talk between ERα and GPR30 in E2-induced
carcinogenesis and whether it could be influenced by
baicalein should also be investigated.
Although flavonoids have been studied for ~60
years, the cellular mechanisms behind their biological
activity remain largely unknown. The anticancer
activities of baicalein have been attributed to a variety of
mechanisms that are important in breast cancer, including
inhibiting 12-LOX activity [43], upregulating DDIT4
expression, inhibiting mTOR [44], and suppressing the
aromatase (CYP19) activity and thus decreasing estrogen
biosynthesis [45]. Several studies have revealed that
baicalein has good safety profile in preclinical and clinical
studies. For example, it is not mutagenic, does not cause
potentially detrimental genomic instability, and does not
appear to be toxic in mice [44, 46]. It also protects against
benzo[а]pyreneand aflatoxin B1-induced genotoxicity
[47]. Furthermore, the safety of orally administered
baicalein in healthy Chinese subjects was confirmed in
a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, single-dose clinical
trial [48]. It was safe and well-tolerated at single oral
doses of 100–2800 mg and no serious adverse events
were reported. Thus, these findings raise the possibility
that baicalein is an attractive candidate anti-cancer drug
and that further studies are warranted toward its clinical
development.
The current results demonstrated that baicalein
inhibits E2-induced neoplastic transformation and the

cancerous phenotype of the breast epithelium. Moreover,
baicalein suppressed the E2-mediated activation of two
key regulatory pathways involved in breast carcinogenesis:
ERα and GPR30 (Figure 7). Targeting the two pathways
simultaneously could represent a novel promising
pharmacological approach for the chemoprevention of
estrogen-dependent breast cancer that expresses one
or both receptors from the onset or following tumor
progression. Together, epidemiologic studies, preclinical
results, and the positive safety profile encourage the
development of baicalein as a potential preventative or
therapeutic drug for reducing the risk of breast cancer.

instructions. Both cell lines were cultured in a 1:1 mixture
of Ham’s F12 medium and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
10479

Oncotarget

medium (DMEM/F-12) (11330032, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), containing 0.1 μg/mL cholera enterotoxin (C8052,
Sigma), 10 μg/mL insulin (I6634, Sigma), 0.5 μg/mL
hydrocortisone (H0888, Sigma), 20 ng/mL epidermal
growth factor (AF-100-15, PeproTech, London, United
Kingdom), and 5% horse serum (HS; 1312396, Gibco).
All cell lines were incubated at 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Because phenol red (PR) has weakly estrogenic
effect [49], both cell lines were treated with 20 nM E2 [4,
50] in the presence or absence of different concentrations
of baicalein in PR-free DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 11039021)
supplemented with the factors mentioned above. Cells
were treated continuously for 5–10 weeks. The cells
were passed when the confluence reached 85–90%;
they were passed approximately twice a week; and the
media were changed every 2 or 3 days. And the followed
experiments were performed in PR-free DMEM/F12
added supplementary factors with or without serum.

well) were the resuspended in medium containing 0.33%
agarose and plated in the plates as the second layer. After
solidifying, 1 mL of medium was plated on top of the
second agar layer to prevent overdrying. Cells were fed
with fresh medium every 3 days and incubated for 21
days. The plates were stained with 0.005% crystal violet
and photographed.

Three-dimensional (3D) cultures on Matrigel
The cells were cultured in Matrigel as reported
previously [20]. Briefly, wells in an eight-chamber slide
were pre-coated with a layer of GFR Matrigel (60 μl/
well) and allowed to polymerize for 30 min. The cells
were counted and diluted in assay medium, and 400 μl of
cells (5000 cells/well) was plated on top of the solidified
Matrigel. The assay medium contained 2% GFR Matrigel,
5 ng/ml EGF, 2% HS, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/
ml cholera toxin, and 10 μg/ml insulin. The cells were
incubated for 12 days, and the media were replaced
every 4 days with fresh assay medium. Images were
captured at 0, 4, 8, and 12 days after seeding using a Leica
DMI 1 microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at 400 ×
magnification.

Trypan blue dye exclusion assay
Cell growth was assessed using the trypan blue
dye exclusion method with manual cell counting with a
hemocytometer (Qiujing, Shanghai, China). The cells were
collected and plated at a density of 5 × 104 in 1 ml/well
in 12-well plates and then incubated for 4 days. The cell
numbers were counted every 24 h, and a cell proliferation
curve was plotted based on the number of cells counted at
different time points.

Immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice models
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and the regulations of the State Food and Drug
Administration (SFDA) of China on animal care and
use of laboratory animals, and the study protocol was
approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal
Experiments of Guizhou Medical University.
Female non-obese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice aged 6–9 weeks
weighting 20–24 g were purchased from Western
Biotechnology Inc (Chongqing, China). The mice were
raised in air-conditioned pathogen-free rooms under
controlled lighting (12 h light/day) and fed with standard
laboratory food and water.
The cells were trypsinized, diluted in PBS, and
were mixed with Matrigel at 1:1 ratio. Cell mixtures
from different treatment groups (2×106 in 50 μl) were
separately implanted into the mammary fat pads of NOD/
SCID mice after treatment for 10 weeks (n = 6). All
mice received an intramuscular injection with exogenous
estrogen (0.3 mg/kg) once 3 days before inoculation
with cells, and the same dose of estrogen was provided
once per week until the end of the experiment [51, 52].
The tumor volume was calculated every other day using
caliper measurements from the time of tumor detection
for 30 days. Tumor size was calculated according to the
formula:
Tumor size = 0.5 × a × b × b,
where a is the tumor length and b is the tumor width
in millimeters.

Wound healing assay
Cells were seeded into 12-well plates and grown
to 90% confluence. The cell monolayers were wounded
with a micropipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove any
floating cells. Then, the cells were incubated in serum-free
medium for 24 h and images were captured at 0 and 24 h
after wound application.

Invasion assay
The invasive ability of the cells was measured using a
transwell chamber assay with 8-μm pore size (R3NA43983,
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) membranes coated with
Matrigel. The cells were trypsinized and suspended at a final
concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free medium. The
cell suspension was added to the upper chamber, and medium
containing 5% HS was added to the bottom chamber as a
chemoattractant. After incubation for 24 h, the upper surfaces
of the membranes were swabbed to remove non-invaded
cells, and any cells that were attached to the lower surface
were fixed in 100% methanol, stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology).

Soft agar colony formation assay
The 0.6% agarose in medium was solidified onto
six-well plates as a bottom layer. The cells (5000 cells/

Docking study

Statistical analysis

The structures of ERα and GPR30 were deposited in
the protein databank and were used with SWISS-MODEL
to build a homology model (ERα PDB code 3ERT, and
GPR30 PDB code 1G50). A molecular docking study was
performed using the Sybyl-X 1.2 protocol to analyze the
receptor-ligand complexes of baicalein and E2 with the
ERα and GPR30 LBDs.

Statistically significant differences were calculated
using one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni
posthoc test for multiple-group comparisons. P < 0.05
was considered to indicate a significant difference and data
are expressed as means ± SEM. The data presented were
obtained from three independent experiments.
