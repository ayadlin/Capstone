ABSTRACT
In metastatic breast cancers, the acquisition of metastatic ability, which leads
to clinically incurable disease and poor survival, has been associated with acquisition
of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program and self-renewing trait (CSCs)
via activation of PI3K/AKT and IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways. We found that
TrkB is a key regulator of PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT signal pathway-mediated tumor
metastasis and EMT program. Here, we demonstrated that TrkB activates AKT by
directly binding to c-Src, leading to increased proliferation. Also, TrkB increases
Twist-1 and Twist-2 expression through activation of JAK2/STAT3 by inducing c-SrcJAK2 complex formation. Furthermore, TrkB in the absence of c-Src binds directly to
JAK2 and inhibits SOCS3-mediated JAK2 degradation, resulting in increased total JAK2
and STAT3 levels, which subsequently leads to JAK2/STAT3 activation and Twist-1
upregulation. Additionally, activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway via induction of IL-6
secretion by TrkB enables induction of activation of the EMT program via induction
of STAT3 nuclear translocation. These observations suggest that TrkB is a promising
target for future intervention strategies to prevent tumor metastasis, EMT program
and self-renewing trait in breast cancer.

phenotype, which results in their having stem cell-like
characteristics (CSCs). There is accumulating evidences of
a role of PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways
in tumor metastasis and EMT. Activation of the PI3K/
AKT pathway, IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway, and stem
cell-like characteristics contribute to the poor outcomes
of metastatic breast cancers [8, 9]. Moreover, activated
JAK2/STAT3 increases AKT activation through the
induction of AKT [10], while increased STAT3 and AKT
activation leads to tumor development and EMT [11, 12].
Independent of these findings, TrkB, a member of the
tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) family of neurotrophin
receptors, is critical to biological processes in the
developing and mature nervous systems, including neuronal
growth, differentiation, and survival [13]. Also, TrkB is
overexpressed in various cancer types, including prostate

INTRODUCTION
There are several discrete steps in the biological
cascade of metastasis, loss of cellular adhesion, increased
motility and invasiveness, entry and survival into circulation,
exit into new tissue, and eventual colonization of a distant
site [1, 2]. During cancer pathogenesis, a transdifferentiation
program defined as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)
is activated to acquire the ability to execute the multiple
steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade [3–5]. Furthermore,
certain epithelial cells that pass through an EMT acquire the
self-renewing traits associated with normal tissue (SCs) and
cancer stem cells (CSCs) [6, 7].
Metastatic breast cancers are more chemoresistant
forms of breast cancer with expression of high levels of
EMT markers and exhibit a CD44high/CD24low antigenic

cancer [14], multiple myeloma [15], Wilms’ tumor [16],
lung cancer [17], pancreatic cancer [18] and neuroblastoma
[19], and is associated with poor prognosis [20, 21]. In
addition, TrkB expression is important to the regulation of
angiogenesis [22] and acts as a potent mediator of anoikis
resistance in epithelial cells through AKT activation [23, 24].
However, the signaling mechanisms of TrkB-mediated
PI3K/AKT activation have remained unclear. Thus, even
though TrkB expression may play an important role in the
tumorignicity of many tumors, it is currently unclear how
TrkB regulate interactions between metastasis and EMT at
the invasive front of the tumor. In this report, we identified
a new network involved in tumor metastasis and EMT that
regulates and coordinates with TrkB. Surprisingly, we found
that TrkB is primarily present in human breast cancer and
acts as a key regulator of the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT
signal pathway-mediated tumor metastasis, EMT, and selfrenewing trait.

as indicated by failure to form microscopic or macroscopic
colonies in soft agar when scored after 16 days (Figure 1C).
These observations led us to speculate that TrkB might
modulate expression or activation of c-Src. To determine
whether TrkB contributes to regulation of c-Src in MADMB-231 cells, we selected highly metastatic MDA-MB-231
and Hs578T cells stably expressing the TrkB-shRNAs. TrkBshRNA partially suppressed the expression of endogenous
TrkB (i.e., a 80% reduction) in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T
cells (Supplementary Figure 1A). We next examined the
expression of Src in MDA-MB-231 control-shRNA or
TrkB-shRNA cells. c-Src expression was not affected by
the knockdown of TrkB in MDA-MB-231 cells, but c-Src
phosphorylation levels were significantly decreased in
MDA-MB-231 TrkB-shRNA cells, suggesting that TrkB
activates c-Src in these cells (Figure 1D). We further
examined whether TrkB expression regulates MEK1/2
and AKT activation, as well as the induction of cyclin D1
expression. Levels of phosphorylated (activated) MEK1/2
and AKT as well as cyclin D1 expression were markedly
reduced in MDA-MB-231 TrkB-shRNA cells relative
to MDA-MB-231 control-shRNA cells (Figure 1E).
These results suggest that TrkB affects proliferation of
MDA-MB-231 cells through activation of c-Src.
To further investigate the induction of c-Src
phosphorylation by TrkB, we examined whether TrkB
directly interacts with c-Src in MDA-MB-231 cells.
Interestingly, endogenous TrkB was able to interact with
endogenous c-Src under physiological conditions (Figure
1F). To confirm this finding in a transient transfection
system, V5-tagged TrkB and HA-tagged c-Src were
transfected into 293T cells. As shown in Figure 1G, TrkB
interacted strongly with c-Src. To identify the functional
domain of c-Src responsible for the interaction with TrkB,
we used a series of c-Src deletion constructs. The c-Src
mutant lacking the N-terminal domain (c-Src ΔKD2, 3),
c-Src ΔC, c-Src ΔKD-1, and c-Src ΔKD-2 still interacted
with TrkB. However, the deletion of amino acid residues
275–360 a.a. (c-Src ΔKD-3) abrogated the TrkB interaction
(Figure 1H). These results clearly indicate that the region
including amino acids 275–360 of c-Src, which includes
the tyrosine kinase domain, is required for TrkB interaction.
Therefore, we examined whether c-Src activation is
involved in the TrkB-induced Mek1 and AKT activation as
well as cyclin D1 expression. To test this notion, we selected
MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing the c-Src-shRNAs. As
shown in Supplementary Figure 1B, knockdown of c-Src in
MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-MB-231 c-Src-shRNA cells)
resulted in decreases in the expression of endogenous c-Src of
over 60%. Moreover, TrkB-induced AKT activation and cyclin
D1 expression were significantly reduced in c-Src-shRNA
cells (Figure 1I), indicating that TrkB might be involved in
tumorigenicity and metastasis of breast cancer through TrkBmediated activation of PI3K/AKT and Ras-MAPK pathways
or upregulation of cyclin D1 expression. Taken together, our
findings show that c-Src is essential for the ability of TrkB

RESULTS
c-Src is required for TrkB-induced activation of
the PI3K-AKT pathway
It is reported that ectopic TrkB expression in RIE1 cells suppresses anoikis through AKT activation [25].
However, the signaling mechanisms that activates PI3K/
AKT signaling pathway have remained unclear. In addition,
c-Src appears to be important for multiple aspects of tumor
progression, including proliferation, disruption of cell/cell
contacts, migration, invasiveness, resistance to apoptosis, and
angiogenesis [26]. c-Src is also known to activate PI3K/AKT
and the MAP/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
kinase (MEK)/ERK cascades through both focal adhesion
kinase (FAK)-dependent and FAK-independent pathways
[27]. This raises the possibility that TrkB regulates tumor
progression by activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via
regulation of c-Src. However, the correlation of TrkB and c-Src
in breast cancer has remained unknown and none of these
findings indicates a link between these two sets of phenomena.
We initially examined whether the elevated levels
of TrkB associated with the increase in phosphorylation of
TrkB. As shown in Figure 1A, a highly metastatic MDAMB-231 human breast cancer cell line expresses high level
of TrkB and it is phosphorylated. Therefore, we investigated
whether TrkB collaborated with c-Src in tumorigenicity
of breast cancer. We found that pretreatment with K252a
(an inhibitor of TrkC tyrosine kinases) and SU6656 (an
inhibitor of c-Src tyrosine kinases) markedly reduced levels
of phosphorylated AKT, as well as induction of cyclin D1,
indicating that the PI3K/AKT pathway, and cyclin D1 act
downstream of c-Src in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1B).
We also investigated whether the inhibition of c-Src kinase
activity blocks the colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells
using SU6656. Upon addition of 5 μM SU6656, the colony
formation of MDA-MB-231 cells was markedly suppressed

also mediates resistance to trastuzumab [32]. Moreover,
activated STAT3 leads to AKT activation [10] and
upregulates Twist-1, an EMT-induced transcription factor
[33, 34]. These observations led us to speculate that TrkB
is involved in regulation of STAT3 activation and PI3K/
AKT signaling through activation of c-Src, and that it

inhibitor, AG490. However, JAK2 and STAT3 expression
levels were not significantly different after treatment
with AG490 (Figure 2B). Our results suggest that c-Src
activation is involved in the upregulation of JAK2, which
is correlated with JAK2 phosphorylation, but not with
STAT3 activation.
Given-mentioned role of TrkB as c-Src activator
via direct interaction, it is possible that the TrkB/c-Src
complex could activate JAK2 via interaction. Indeed, we
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

found that both TrkB and c-Src interacted with JAK2 after
transient transfection (Supplementary Figure 2A). Moreover,
endogenous TrkB interacted with endogenous c-Src/JAK2 in
MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells (Figure 2C). Furthermore,
JAK2 interacted with TrkB even in the absence of c-Src
or SU6656 treatment, indicating a direct binding of TrkB
to JAK2 (Figures 2D and Supplementary Figure 2B). To
identify the JAK2 functional domain responsible for its
interaction with TrkB, we used a series of JAK2 deletion

constructs. A JAK2 mutant containing the tyrosine kinase
domain interacted with TrkB, whereas TrkB did not interact
with the JAK2 B41, SH2, or pseudokinase domain mutants
(Supplementary Figure 2C). To further determine whether
TrkB-JAK2 formed a complex in the absence of c-Src, we
expressed TrkB in SYF cells derived from triple knockout mouse embryos lacking members of the Src kinase
family (c-Src, Yes, and Fyn) (Klinghoffer et al., 1999). We
transiently transfected SYF-TrkB and SYF-c-Src-TrkB cells
with JAK2. As shown in Supplementary Figure 2D, TrkBJAK2 complexes were detected in both c-Src-deficient
SYF-TrkB and SYF-c-Src-TrkB cells. Moreover, TrkB

in the absence of c-Src was sufficient to induce of JAK2
expression in SYF-TrkB cells (Supplementary Figure 2E).
Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 TrkB-shRNA cells
demonstrated much lower Twist-1 and Twist-2 mRNA
levels than MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SU6656
(Figure 2E). Additionally, TrkB knockdown exhibited an
almost 3-fold decrease in promoter activity of Twist-1 and
Twist-2 genes relative to SU6656 treatment (Figures 2E and
Supplementary 2F). These results suggest that Twist-1 or
Twist-2 upregulation by TrkB might be regulated via at least
two downstream pathways involving the c-Src. Moreover,

cells. Furthermore, JAK2, STAT3, and Twist-1 expression
was markedly increased in SYF-TrkB or SYF-cSrc-TrkB
cells compared to SYF or SYF-c-Src cells (Figure 2F and

luciferase activity in SYF-TrkB and SYF-c-Src-TrkB cells.
Also, ectopic TrkB expression increased promoter activity
of Twist-1 and Twist-2 genes in SYF cells and SYF-cSrc cells. Moreover, both TrkB and c-Src synergistically
increased Twist-1 and Twist-2 luciferase activity
(Supplementary Figure 2G), and significantly increased
JAK2 and STAT3 expression, suggesting that TrkB directly

(Figure  3A). Additionally, STAT3, Twist-1 and Twist-2
mRNA expression was markedly reduced in response to
TrkB knockdown (Supplementary Figure 3A and 3C).
Moreover, promoter activity of STAT3, Twist-1 and Twist-2
genes was significantly decreased in Hs578T and MDAMB-231 TrkB-shRNA cells compared to its control-shRNA

the inhibition of TrkB activation by K252a treatment
significantly reduced JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation

and downregulated JAK2, STAT3, and Twist-1 expression
(Figure 3B). These observations suggest that tyrosine kinase
activity of TrkB is required for JAK2/STAT3/Twist-1
induction as well as JAK2/STAT3 expression.
Because TrkB knockdown reduced the JAK2 protein
levels, we initially focused on JAK2 expression. TrkB
knockdown significantly reduced the JAK2 protein levels,
but had no effect on JAK2 mRNA levels (Figure  3C),
suggesting that TrkB post-translationally controls JAK2
protein stability. The SOCS3 protein is known to bind
to JAK2 and suppress JAK2 activity through direct
binding to the JAK2 catalytic center and promotion of
the proteasomal degradation of JAK2 [35]. Therefore,

we investigated whether JAK2 stabilization by TrkB was
mediated through the suppression of JAK2 ubiquitination.
When JAK2 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate,
level of JAK2 ubiquitination was markedly reduced when
TrkB was coexpressed (Figure 3D). TrkB also suppressed
JAK2 ubiquitination, even in the presence of SOCS3, which
mediated the negative feedback inhibition of the JAK–STAT
pathway (Figure 3E). Therefore, we investigated whether
TrkB induced JAK2 activation by blocking the ability of
SOCS3 to ubiquitinate and degrade JAK2 through SOCS3JAK2 complex formation. As expected, TrkB coexpression
significantly reduced the level of SOCS3-associated JAK2
(Figure 3F). We next compared the JAK2-SOCS3 complex
formation in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T TrkB-shRNA cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to that of the control-shRNA cells. The level of endogenous
SOCS3 associated with JAK2 was dramatically increased in
MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T TrkB-shRNA cells, which was
correlated with decreased JAK2 (Figure 3G). These results
indicated that TrkB inhibited proteasome-mediated JAK2
degradation by blocking SOCS3-JAK2 complex formation,
leading to activation of the JAK2/STAT3/Twist-1 axis.

functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and
survival (Catlett-Falcone et al., 1999; Heinrich et al., 2003;
Oshiro et al., 2001; Puthier et al., 1999). Moreover, the IL-6/
STAT3/JAK2 pathway is involved in the maintenance of
stem cell–like cancer cells [36] because CD44+CD24+ and
CD44+CD24- breast cancer cells have high phospho-STAT3
via their expression of genes such as IL6, PTGIS, and HAS1,
which activate an autocrine loop [8]. Furthermore, high
IL-6 levels have been associated with poor clinical outcome
in breast cancer patients [37]. We speculated that STAT3
activation by TrkB depends on the activation of autocrine
signaling loops. To investigate whether TrkB is relevant to
IL-6 expression, we examined IL-6 expression in a panel of
HMLE and MDA-MB-231 or its TrkB knockdown cells.
The mRNA levels of IL-6 were significantly upregulated
in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to HMLE and its TrkB
knockdown cells (Figure 4A and 4B). Together, increased
secretion of IL-6 protein (4.5- to 5-fold) by MDA-MB-231
cells, relative to TrkB knockdown cells, correlated with
increased mRNA levels of IL-6 (Figure 4C).
To further examine the TrkB-mediated regulation
of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, we assessed IL-6-induced
JAK2 and STAT3 activation in MBA-MB-231 and Hs578T
control-shRNA or TrkB-shRNA cells. Relative to the MDAMB-231 and Hs578T control-shRNA cells, TrkB-shRNA
cells showed significantly reduced activation and expression
of JAK2/STAT3, as well as Twist-1 expression after
stimulation with or without IL-6 (Figure 4D). Furthermore,
STAT3 nuclear translocation after IL-6 treatment was
markedly increased in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T controlshRNA cells relative to TrkB knockdown cells (Figure
4E). Additionally, the expression and promoter activity
of Twist-1 and Twist-2 genes was markedly increased in
MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T control-shRNA cells, but not in
its TrkB-shRNA cells (Figure 4F and 4G). Together, these
observations indicate that the role of TrkB in activation of
the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway can also serve to induce
entry into a stem cell-like state, allowing the derivation of
cells with metastatic potential.

and MCF10A-TrkB cells downregulated the expression
of mRNA and proteins of epithelial markers (such as
E-cadherin, and α-catenin), while they upregulated the
expression of mRNA and proteins of mesenchymal
markers (such as N-cadherin, fibronectin, and vimentin)
(Figure 5A and 5B). Also, promoter activity of E-cadherin
gene was also efficiently suppressed in the MDCK-TrkB
cells compared to the MDCK-control cells (Figure 5C).
In addition, immunostaining revealed that, relative to the
expression of E-cadherin in MDCK-TrkB cells, the level
of E-cadherin in MDCK cells was strongly induced and
N-cadherin expression was markedly reduced (Figure 5D).
During the process of tumor metastasis, which is
often enabled by EMT program, pleiotropically acting
transcription factors, such as E12, Goosecoid, SIP1,
Snail, Twist-1, and Twist-2, are induced that orchestrate
EMT programs [6, 41]. These recent study and our above
observations led us to speculate that TrkB might contribute
to induction of EMT via modulation of pleiotropically
acting transcription factors. We examined whether
TrkB regulates the expression of SIP1, E12, Goosecoid,
Twist-1, and Twist-2. There was a considerable increase
in the expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors,
specifically Twist-1, and Twist-2, in MDCK-TrkB
and MCF10A-TrkB cells but not with SIP1, E12, and
Goosecoid expression (Figure 5E), which was correlated
with increased luciferase activity and expression of mRNA
encoding Twist-1 and Twist-2 (Figure 5F and 5G).
Also, relative to the parental MDA-MB-231
control-shRNA cells, TrkB-shRNA cells significantly
downregulated the expression of mesenchymal markers such
as N-cadherin and fibronectin, whereas they upregulated the
expression of epithelial markers (such as E-cadherin and
α-catenin). Moreover, the levels of Twist-1 was significantly
downregulated in MDA-MB-231 TrkB-shRNA cells relative
to MDA-MB-231 control-shRNA cells (Supplementary
Figure 4A). Furthermore, we found that the immunoactivity
of epithelial or mesenchymal markers in MDA-MB-231
control-shRNA cells was correlated with the expression levels
of MDCK-TrkB cells as shown in Supplementary Figure 4B.
In addition, immunostaining data revealed that the Twist-1
protein in MDA-MB-231 control-shRNA cells was strongly
upregulated (Supplementary Figure 4C) relative to the
expression of Twist-1 in MDA-MB-231 TrkB-shRNA cells,
which was correlated with the expression of mRNA encoding
Twist-1 and Twist-2. These results provided further evidence
that TrkB contributed to the EMT phenotype through
activation of the PI3K/AKT and IL6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway.

TrkB induces EMT through activation of the
JAK2/STAT3 pathway and PI3K/AKT pathway
The results of a recent study suggests that Twist-1 and
Twist-2 induce activation of the EMT program to maintain
the resulting mesenchymal state [38–40]. Moreover,
cooperation between the Stat3 and AKT signaling
pathways results in tumor development and EMT in the
prostates of mice [11]. Therefore, we investigated whether
the contribution of TrkB to tumor metastasis involved
EMT induction through activation of the JAK2/STAT3
and PI3K/AKT pathways. To address this possibility, we
examined whether expression of TrkB was able to promote
an EMT in normal mammalian cells. To accomplish this,
we overexpressed TrkB in MDCK and MCF10A cells by
ectopic expression of TrkB. As anticipated, MDCK-TrkB

Knockdown of TrkB significantly reduces tumor
growth and metastasis in vivo
To determine the contribution of TrkB to primary
tumor formation, we injected MDA-MB-231 cells
expressing either TrkB-shRNA or control-shRNA into
the mouse mammary fat pads of BALB/c Nu/Nu mice
40166

and examined the resulting primary tumors 30 days later.
Control MDA-MB-231 cells formed primary mammary
tumors at identical rates, whereas primary tumor formation
by MDA-MB-231 TrkB-shRNA cells was markedly
decreased (Figure 6A and 6B). These results demonstrate
that TrkB is essential to primary tumor formation by
MDA-MB-231 cells.
To determine if the loss of TrkB expression affected
the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to metastasize, MDAMB-231 cells expressing either TrkB-shRNA or the control
shRNA were injected into the tail veins of BALB/c Nu/Nu
mice, and their lungs were examined for metastases 35 days
after injection. Suppression of TrkB expression strongly
reduced the number of metastatic nodules relative to
MDA-MB-231 control-shRNA cells (Figure 6C and 6D).
Additionally, histological analyses confirmed that the
number of micrometastatic lesions was drastically reduced
in the lungs of mice with MDA-MB-231 TrkB-shRNA cells
(Figure 6E). Importantly, few metastatic nodules in the
lungs of mice carrying TrkB-shRNA cells retained TrkB
expression, but TrkB expression in the lungs of mice with
TrkB-shRNA cells was greatly reduced relative to the lungs
of mice carrying control-shRNA cells (Figure 6F and 6G).
Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry
analysis of Twist-1 and Twist-2 revealed reduced expression
in the lungs of mice injected with MDA-MB-231 TrkBshRNA cells compared to their control counterparts (Figure
6H and 6I). These results indicated that expression of TrkB
is required for the full metastatic ability of highly metastatic
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

EMT, anokis suppression, c-Src activated PI3K/AKT and
Ras/MAPK cascades [23, 27, 48, 49].
We further dissected the role of TrkB in
tumorigenicity and metastasis. Activated STAT3 was
able to transform cells in vitro and was required for cell
transformation of a number of oncogenes and activation
of STAT3 by interleukin-6 or expression of activated c-Src
induced Twist expression at the protein and mRNA levels
[29–31, 34, 50–52]. These previous observations led us to
investigate whether TrkB regulates STAT3 activation via
c-Src activation. We found that c-Src activation by TrkB
was required for JAK2 activation through interaction with
JAK2, but not with STAT3. TrkB significantly upregulated
the JAK2 protein level, which had no effect on the JAK2
mRNA level. Moreover, TrkB in the absence of c-Src
is sufficient to activate JAK2/STAT3 through blocking
of JAK2 degradation by SOCS3 after directly binding
to the JAK2, as well as upregulation of EMT related
transcription factors, such as Twist-1 and Twist-2. A
great deal of research has described the role of SOCS3,
which specifically prevents activation of STAT3 by IL-6
[35, 53–57]. Our studies further uncovered TrkB as a key
regulator in coordinating the actions of JAK2 and c-Src in
tumorigenesis.
Recent studies showed that the IL-6 inflammatory
feedback loop leads to CSC self-renewal and induction of
EMT, both of which are implicated in tumor metastasis and
poor outcomes by therapeutic resistance [8, 9, 36, 37, 58].
Moreover, IL-6 secretion induced by HER2 overexpression
elicited JAK2/STAT3 activation [59]. Therefore, we
investigated whether TrkB enforces an autocrine loop
of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 via induction of IL-6 secretion.
Although IL-6 is regulated by multiple factors, increased
secretion of IL-6 protein (4.5- to 5-fold) by TrkB was
found to be correlated with increased mRNA levels of IL6. Furthermore, induction of STAT3 nuclear translocation
by TrkB induced EMT via increased expression of EMT
related transcription factors such as Twist-1 and Twist-2.
Recent evidence indicates transcription factors Twist-1
and Twist-2, which are master regulators of embryonic
morphogenesis, play an essential role in metastasis, CSCs
and EMT of breast cancer [39, 40, 60–66]. Both proteins
override oncogene induced premature senescence by
abrogating key regulators of the p53- and Rb-dependent
pathways. Moreover, AKT2 is a transcriptional regulatory
target of Twist that acts downstream of Twist to promote
cancer cell survival, migration, and invasion [67]. In
addition, JAK2/STAT3 activity is required for activation of
the PI3K/AKT pathway via upregulation of AKT1 promoter
activity [10, 68]. Those studies and our results presented
herein indicate that downstream mediation of TrkB is more
complex, and is likely to be cellular context dependent and/
or promoter dependent. Although the results of this study by
no means exclude the involvement of other factors, they do
suggest that activation of the IL-6 autocrine loop by TrkB
maintains the metastatic potential and CSCs self-renewal

DISCUSSION
TrkB is overexpressed in several human cancers,
ranging from neuroblastomas to pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinomas, and its overexpression suppresses
anoikis as an EMT inducer by regulation of Zeb1 [23, 42].
Independent of these discoveries, CD44high/CD24low cells,
which show a stem cell-like phenotype, are enriched in
highly metastatic breast cancer cells (basal or claudin-low
breast subtypes) have been proposed to be resistant to cancer
therapies through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway,
IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway, and EMT [8, 43–47]. Although
increasing evidence implies that altered PI3K/AKT signaling
in response to ectopic TrkB promotes tumor formation and
metastasis, the molecular mechanisms of TrkB-mediated
PI3K/AKT modulation in breast cancer have remained
unknown, and none of the findings reported to date hinted at
a link between these two sets of phenomena.
In the present study, we found that activation of the
MEK and PI3K/AKT pathway through TrkB-mediated
c-Src activation after TrkB-c-Src complex formation
induced tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of breast
cancer. These our results are supported by those of a
previous study in which the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathways required for

pathway, and EMT (Supplementary Figure 5). Overall, we
identified a new molecular and functional network present in
cancer metastasis that regulates and coordinates with TrkB.
Moreover, we demonstrated that TrkB has the potential for
use as a new target for improving the treatment efficacy of
metastatic breast cancer.

resulting cDNA was employed in PCR using SYBRGreen Master PCR mix and Taqman master PCR mix
(Applied Biosystems). All PCR analyses were conducted
in triplicate using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). All quantitations were
normalized to endogenous control 18S RNA. Specific
TrkB (Hs00178811_m1) and 18S (Hs99999901_s1)
quantitative probes for Taqman RT-PCR were obtained
from Applied Biosystems and the primer sequences used
to amplify the genes are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents

Luciferase reporter assay

Human breast cancer (MCF10A, SUM149, MDAMB-231, and Hs578T), SYF, 293T, and MDCK cell lines
were maintained as previously described [40, 69, 70]. The
protein kinase inhibitor K252a and SU6656, and AG490
was purchased from Calbiochem.

Cells that were 50% confluent in 12-well dishes
were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
A total of 0.5 μg E-cadherin, Twist-1, Twist-2, or STAT3
reporter gene constructs and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-gal were
cotransfected per well. Cell extracts were prepared 48 hrs
after transfection, and the luciferase activity was quantified
using an Enhanced Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega). All
experiments were performed in triplicate.

Plasmids
Each of the two shRNA-encoding oligonucleotides
against mouse and human TrkB was designed and verified
to be specific to TrkB through BLAST searches against
the mouse and human genomes, respectively. The primers
corresponding to TrkB were cloned into the pLKO lentiviral
vector to generate the TrkB-shRNA expression plasmid
(Supplementary Table 1). shRNA that did not match any
known mouse- or human-coding cDNA was used as a control.

Animal studies
BALB/c Nu/Nu mice were purchased from the
Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology
(KRIBB, South Korea) and handled in compliance with the
IACUC. For tumorigenicity studies, 1 × 105 cells suspended
in 50 μl PBS/Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected
subcutaneously into the left and right hind flank regions under
anesthesia. Mice were euthanized at 5 weeks and primary
tumors were excised for analysis. For tail-vein injection, 1 ×
105 cells suspended in 50 μl PBS were injected into the tail
vein of 7-week-old BALB/c Nu/Nu mice.

Antibodies, western blotting,
immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence
Assays were performed as previously described,
with modification [40, 69]. The antibodies were obtained
from the following companies: anti-HA(Y-11), anti-c-Src,
and anti-Myc (9E10) were from Santa Cruz; anti-V5 was
from Invitrogen; anti-TrkB and anti-SOCS3 were from
Abcam; anti-phospho-c-Src, anti-Twist-1, anti-STAT3,
anti-phospho-STAT3, anti-JAK2, and anti-phosphoJAK2 were from Cell Signaling Technology; and anti-Ecadherin, anti-fibronectin, anti-N-cadherin, anti-α-catenin,
and anti-β-catenin were from BD Transduction.

In vivo bioluminescent imaging
Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 150
ng/g D-Luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences, cat#12279)
and anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane. At 7–8 min after
injection, animals were imaged using the Xenogen
Spectrum (IVIS-200) imaging system.

IL-6 ELISA assay

Viral production, colony formation assay, and
RT-PCR

The equal numbers of MDA-MB-231 controlshRNA or TrkB-shRNA cells were plated and cultured for
3 days. Subsequently, conditioned media from these cell
cultures were collected and analyzed by the Human IL-6
Quantikine ELIZA kit (R&D systems) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

All assays were performed as previously described
[69, 71]. The primer sequences used to amplify the genes are
listed in the Supplementary Tables (Supplementary Table 2).

Quantitative RT-PCR
The primer sequences are listed in the supplemental
experimental procedures (Supplementary Table 2). Total
RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and reverse
transcribed with the hexa-nucleotide mix (Roche). The
