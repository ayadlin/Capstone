Abstract
The Rho-associated kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 are critical for cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting
they may be useful therapeutic targets. In this study, we describe the discovery and development of RKI-1447, a
potent small molecule inhibitor of ROCK1 and ROCK2. Crystal structures of the RKI-1447/ROCK1 complex
revealed that RKI-1447 is a Type I kinase inhibitor that binds the ATP binding site through interactions with the
hinge region and the DFG motif. RKI-1447 suppressed phosphorylation of the ROCK substrates MLC-2 and MYPT1 in human cancer cells, but had no effect on the phosphorylation levels of the AKT, MEK, and S6 kinase at
concentrations as high as 10 mmol/L. RKI-1447 was also highly selective at inhibiting ROCK-mediated
cytoskeleton re-organization (actin stress ﬁber formation) following LPA stimulation, but does not affect
PAK-meditated lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia formation following PDGF and Bradykinin stimulation, respectively.
RKI-1447 inhibited migration, invasion and anchorage-independent tumor growth of breast cancer cells. In
contrast, RKI-1313, a much weaker analog in vitro, had little effect on the phosphorylation levels of ROCK
substrates, migration, invasion or anchorage-independent growth. Finally, RKI-1447 was highly effective at
inhibiting the outgrowth of mammary tumors in a transgenic mouse model. In summary, our ﬁndings establish
RKI-1447 as a potent and selective ROCK inhibitor with signiﬁcant anti-invasive and antitumor activities and offer
a preclinical proof-of-concept that justify further examination of RKI-1447 suitability as a potential clinical
candidate. Cancer Res; 72(19); 5025–34. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The Rho family of small GTPases transduces biological
signals from cell surface receptors such as receptor tyrosine
kinases to the nucleus. They act as molecular switches that
bind GTP (active) and GDP (inactive) to regulate cell proliferation, survival and cytoskeleton organization, thus, affecting
cell shape/morphology, adhesion and movement (1–3). Some
of these GTPases, particularly RhoA and RhoC, have attracted
much attention because of their well-documented role in
malignant transformation hallmarks including migration,
invasion, and metastasis. For example, RhoA and RhoC are
required for Ras-driven malignant transformation (4), and
their overexpression induces migration, invasion, and metastasis whereas their dominant negative forms block these hallAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Drug Discovery Department, H. Lee Mofﬁtt Cancer

marks of cancer (5, 6). Furthermore, several Rho GTPases are
over expressed in a large number of human cancers (7–10), and
the expression of RhoA and RhoC has been shown to be much
higher in metastatic tumors (11, 12). Several studies have
suggested RhoC as a prognostic biomarker for metastasis in
melanoma, breast and pancreatic cancer patients (5, 11, 12).
The mechanism by which RhoA and RhoC contribute to
metastasis is believed to involve the binding of RhoA-GTP and
RhoC-GTP to their major effectors, the Rho-associated kinases
1 and 2, together referred to here as ROCKs (13–19). ROCKs
control cell shape, adhesion and migration by regulating actin–
myosin contractibility. This is accomplished by ROCKs phosphorylating several major substrates such as myosin light
chain (MLC), the MLC phosphatase PP1 regulatory subunit
MYPT-1 and LIM kinases 1 and 2. Phosphorylation of MLC
activates it to drive migration and invasion (14, 20). Phosphorylation of LIMK 1 and 2 activates it to phosphorylate and
inactivate coﬁlin from inhibiting migration/invasion (21).
Phosphorylation of MYPT-1 blocks dephosphorylation and
inactivation of MLC (16).
The role of ROCKs in migration, invasion and metastasis has
been well documented. For example, over expression of ROCKs
induces migration and invasion in several tumor types including breast cancer (22–24) whereas dominant negative ROCKs
and ROCKs inhibitors block invasion and metastasis in vitro
and in vivo (23, 25–30). Furthermore, the expression levels of

ROCKs is 10-fold higher in breast tumor biopsies as compared
to their corresponding normal mammary tissue, and these high
expression levels correlate with metastasis, poor clinical outcome and shorter survival time of breast cancer patients
(26, 31). The overwhelming evidence implicating the Rho
GTPases/ROCK pathway in migration, invasion and metastasis
prompted the development of inhibitors to interfere with this
pathway with the ultimate goal of discovering novel antitumor
drugs (14, 26, 27, 29). To this end several approaches have been
taken. One of these is to develop geranylgeranyltransferase-1
(GGT-1) inhibitors (GGTI), because GTPases such as RhoA and
RhoC require the lipid posttranslation modiﬁcation geranylgeranylation for their ability to induce malignant transformations (32). Although this approach has shown great promise
preclinically and one compound GGTI-2418 has reached Phase
I clinical trials (33), a drawback is that GGTIs inhibit GGT-1, an
enzyme that has dozens of substrates (32). A more selective
approach to interfering with the Rho GTPase/ROCK pathway is
to develop ROCK inhibitors as potential antimetastatic agents.
In this manuscript, we describe the discovery and development
of RKI-1447 a highly potent ROCK inhibitor. First, using X-ray
crystallography we solved the structure of the RKI-1447ROCK1 complex and determined the mode of action of RKI1447. Furthermore, we showed that RKI-1447 suppresses
ROCK-dependent signaling, cell morphology, anchorage-independent cell growth, migration invasion, and in vivo growth of
mammary tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Human breast (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) and lung
(H-1299) cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. These cells have not been authenticated.
ROCK1 and ROCK2 kinase assays
The Invitrogen Z-Lyte FRET kinase assay with KKRPQRRYSNVF peptide as substrate (from MLC sequence) was used
(Invitrogen, cat. PV3793) exactly as described by us (34).
Enzyme puriﬁcation and protein crystallography
Enzyme puriﬁcation and protein crystallography were carried out exactly as described by us previously (34). Data were
reduced with XDS (35). The structure was solved by molecular
replacement using the MolRep program from CCP4 (36) with
the monomer of pdb 3TV7 as a starting model. PHENIX (37)
was used for reﬁnement, and model building was done using
Coot (38). Figures were prepared using PYMOL (39).
Evaluation of the phosphorylation levels of MLC-2 and
MYPT-1 by Western blot analysis
Cells were plated and treated the next day with vehicle,
RKI-1447 or RKI-1313 for 1 hour. [The chemical synthesis of
RKI-1447 and RKI-1313 was described by us (34). The mesylate
salts of the compounds were used to enhance solubility.]
The cells were then harvested, lysed and processed for
Western blotting as described by us previously (40). The
antibodies that were used for Western blotting were MYPT1

Tubulin (Cat#T5168; Sigma).
Determination of anchorage-independent growth using
soft agar assays
The soft agar assays were carried out exactly as described by
us (41).
Migration assay
MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at 4  105 cells per well in a
6-well plate and allowed to grow overnight. The cells were then
starved for 24 hours. The media was then aspirated and the
cells were scratched with a pipette tip, and treated either with
vehicle, RKI-1447 or RKI-1313 at the indicated concentrations
for 24 hours. Pictures were taken with a Leica Microscope
before (time 0) and 24 hours after drug treatments.
Invasion assay
Invasion assay was carried out in Corning Transwell inserts
coated with Matrigel. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at
3.5  105 and allowed to grow overnight in a 6-well plate. The
cells were then treated with either vehicle, RKI-1447 or RKI1313 for 21 hours and trypsinized, resuspended in DMEM
containing 0.1% BSA and plated at 20,000 cells/insert in the
top chamber over the Matrigel. The bottom chamber contained 20% FBS as the "chemoattractant". The cells in the top
chamber were carefully removed after 48 hours and the ﬁlter
membranes containing the invaded cells were ﬁxed with
methanol, stained with crystal violet and photographed. The
membranes were then dis-solved in 10% acetic acid and the
absorbance was read at 540 nm.
Effects of RKI-1447 and RKI-1313 on cell morphology
NIH 3T3 cells were plated at 8000 cells/well in 8-chamber
slides in serum free media for 24 hours, and treated with
vehicle, 1 mmol/L RKI-1447 or 1 mmol/L RKI-1313 for 1 hour.
The cells were then stimulated with complete media,
10 mmol/L LPA, 200 ng/mL bradykinin, or 30 ng/mL PDGF
for 30 minutes. After stimulation, the cells were ﬁxed in 4%
para-formaldehyde and stained with Texas-Red Phalloidin.
Mounting medium containing DAPI (Cat#H-1200; Vector
Laboratories) was then added and at least 100 cells per well
were observed. The cells were imaged using Zeiss Upright
ﬂuorescence microscope.
RKI-1447 antitumor efﬁcacy studies
MMTV/neu transgenic mice [FVB/N-Tg (MMTVneu) 202
Mul/J] were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and bred
to produce multiple litters to maintain the colony. The antitumor efﬁcacy studies were carried out exactly as described
by us previously (41). In brief, the mice were treated i.p. daily
for 14 days with either vehicle [20%–2-hydroxypropyl-betacyclodextrin (HPCD)] or 200 mpk RKI-1447 dissolved in freshly

inhibitor). Figure 1A and B show that RKI-1447 inhibits
potently ROCK1 and ROCK2 in a dose-dependent manner with
IC50 values of 14.5 and 6.2 nmol/L, respectively. In contrast,
RKI-1313 where the meta-hydroxyl on the phenyl ring of RKI1447 was replaced with a para-methoxy group was much less
active and had IC50 values 34 mmol/L for ROCK 1 and 8 mmol/L
for ROCK2 (Fig. 1A and B).

Discovery of RKI-1447, a highly potent ROCK1 and
ROCK2 inhibitor
Our chemistry efforts resulted recently in the identiﬁcation
of a family of pyridylthiazole ROCK inhibitors (34). Structure
activity relationship studies of this family of ROCK inhibitors
led to the discovery of a pair of closely related analogues; RKI1447 (potent ROCK inhibitor) and RKI-1313 (weak ROCK

Crystal structure of the RKI-1447-ROCK1 complex
reveals that RKI-1447 is a Type 1 inhibitor that binds
both the hinge region and the DFG motif of the ROCK ATP
binding site
To determine the mode of binding of RKI-1447 to ROCK, we
determined the crystal structure of RKI-1447 in complex with

prepared HPCD. The percentage change in volume was calculated on the basis of the tumor volume on the last day of
treatment (Vf) relative to that on the day of initiation of
treatment (V0). The average percentage change in tumor
volume was then calculated for each treatment group.

the kinase domain of human ROCK1 (residues 6-415). The RKI1447-ROCK1 complex was crystallized in space group C2221
with 2 ROCK1 dimers in the asymmetric unit. The structure
was reﬁned to 2.9 Å with Rcryst and Rfree values of 22.8% and
29.0%, respectively. Figure 1C shows the overall structure of the
dimer and the interactions that RKI-1447 establishes in the
ATP binding site. Speciﬁcally, RKI-1447 is a Type I inhibitor
that binds to the hinge region through a hydrogen bond formed
between the pyridine ring nitrogen and the main chain amide
NH of Met156. The inhibitor extends from the hinge region
along Asp216 of the DFG motif towards the b-turn comprising
residues Gly85–Gly88. The urea moiety interacts with the
e-amino group of Lys105 and the carboxyl group of Asp216.
The phenol hydroxyl is in hydrogen bonding distance with the
main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly85. The pyridine, thiazole,
and phenol moieties of the inhibitor form multiple van der
Waals (hydrophobic) interactions with surrounding residues
(3.4 Å < d < 4 Å). The network of noncovalent binding
interactions between RKI-1447 and ROCK1 together with the
extended, low energy conformation of the inhibitor, explain the
high inhibitory potency of RKI-1447 towards ROCKs. This
binding mode also explains the weak inhibitory activity of the
analogue RKI-1313. Introduction of the methoxy group in para
position of the phenyl ring is likely to cause substantial steric
hindrance with Gly88 and Phe87 [Fig. 1C (panel (c)]. In
addition, elimination of the hydroxyl group from the meta
position of the phenyl ring will result in the loss of hydrogen
bonding potential with the main chain carbonyl of Gly85.

RKI-1447 is much more potent than RKI-1313 at
inhibiting the phosphorylation of the ROCK substrates
MLC-2 and MYPT-1 in human cancer cells
We next determined the ability of RKI-1447 and RKI-1313 to
inhibit ROCKs in intact human cancer cells. To this end, we
determined the effects of RKI-1447 and RKI-1313 on the
phosphorylation levels of 2 ROCK substrates: MLC-2 and
MYPT-1. This was carried out by treating cells with various
concentrations of the compounds and processing the cells for
Western immunoblotting to determine their effects on the
levels of P-MLC-2, P-MYPT-1, total MLC-2, and total MYPT-1 as
described under Materials and Methods section. Figure 2A
shows that RKI-1447 treatment of MDA-MB-231 human breast
cancer cells decreased the levels of P-MLC-2, but not total
MLC-2, in a concentration-dependent manner with signiﬁcant
effects starting at 100 nmol/L. RKI-1313 did not decrease PMLC-2 at 10 mmol/L consistent with its weak inhibitory activity
against ROCK1 and ROCK2 in vitro (Fig. 1B). RKI-1447 also
decreased the levels of P-MYPT-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells in a
dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S1). Similar
results were obtained with another human breast cancer cell
line, MDA-MB-468, where RKI-1447 decreased the levels of
both P-MLC-2 and P-MYPT-1 in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, RK1-1447 but not RKI1313 inhibited the levels of P-MYPT-1 in a concentrationdependent manner in H1299 human lung cancer cells (Fig.
2B). Figure 2A also shows that RKI-1447 had no effects on the
phosphorylation levels of Akt, Mek, and S6 suggesting that RKI-

1447 is selective for ROCK over kinases that phosphorylate Akt
(i.e., mTORC2), Mek (i.e., PAK), and S6 (i.e., S6K).

(Fig. 3B). These results further support the selectivity of RKI1447 as a ROCK inhibitor.

RKI-1447 inhibits LPA-induced actin stress ﬁber
formation but not PDGF-induced lamellipodia
formation or bradykinin-induced ﬁlopodia formation.
The ability of LPA to induce actin stress ﬁber formation is
known to be mediated by activation of the RhoA/ROCK
pathway whereas the ability of PDGF and bradykinin to induce
lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia is known to be mediated by the
RAC1/PAK and the CDC42/PAK pathways, respectively. We
reasoned that if RKI-1447 is selective for ROCKs, then it should
only inhibit LPA-induced actin stress ﬁber formation but not
lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia formation by PDGF and Bradykinin.
To this end, we starved NIH3T3 cells and treated them with
either vehicle or RKI-1447 before stimulation with either LPA,
PDGF or Bradykinin, stained the cells with phalloidin to
evaluate their morphological changes as described under
Materials and Methods section. Figure 3A shows that starved
cells contain no actin stress ﬁbers, ﬁlopodia or lamellipodia.
Stimulation with LPA resulted in actin stress ﬁber formation
and this was blocked by RKI-1447 but not RKI-1313 treatment.
Stimulation with PDGF resulted in the formation of lamellipodia and this was not affected by RKI-1447 treatment (Fig.
3B). Similar results were obtained with Bradykinin where RKI1447 had no effects on bradykinin-induced ﬁlopodia formation

RKI-1447 is much more potent than RKI-1313 at
inhibiting anchorage-independent colony formation,
migration and invasion of breast cancer cells
The results presented in Figs. 1–3, and Supplementary Fig.
S1 clearly showed that RKI-1447 is a potent and selective
ROCK1 and ROCK2 inhibitor capable of reaching its target
and inhibiting selectively the phosphorylation of the ROCK
substrates MLC-2 and MYPT-1. Because of the prominent role
that ROCKs play in adhesion, migration and invasion we
reasoned that inhibition of ROCKs should result in suppression
of these hallmarks of malignant transformation. To this end,
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with various concentrations of
RKI-1447 and its less active analogue RKI-1313 and processed
for anchorage-independent tumor colony formation in soft
agar, migration using wound healing assays and invasion using
Boyden Chamber assays as described under Materials and
Methods section. Figure 4 shows that treatment of MDA-MB231 cells with RKI-1447 hampered their ability to form soft agar
colonies with an IC50 value of 709 nmol/L. In contrast, RKI-1313
up to 30 mmol/L had little effect. Furthermore, in the absence of
RKI-1447, MDA-MB-231 cells migrated after being scratched
and ﬁlled the wound created by the scratch (Fig. 5). Treatment
with RKI-1447 inhibited this scratch-induced migration at both

MDA-MB-231 cells with RKI-1447 inhibited their seruminduced invasion by 53% and 85% at 1 and 10 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 6). Consistent with the soft agar and migration
assays, RKI-1313 had little effect on inhibiting MDA-MB-231
tumor cell invasion (Fig. 6). It is important to point out that
RKI-1447 at these concentrations (1 and 10 mmol/L) was more
than 10-fold less active at inhibiting anchorage-dependent
proliferation/survival of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
as measured by MTT assay (see Supplementary Fig. S2),

growth, migration and invasion is most likely not due to its
ability to inhibit anchorage-dependent proliferation/survival.
Consistent with this, RKI-1447 concentrations as high as
10 mmol/L did not induce apoptosis (PARP cleavage) and had
little effect on cell-cycle progression (Supplementary Fig. S3).
RKI-1447 inhibits mammary tumor growth in vivo
The results described in Figs. 1–6 show that RKI-1447 is a
potent and selective ROCK inhibitor that suppresses ROCKdriven cytoskeleton re-organization, signaling, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent tumor cell growth of breast
cancer cells. Although these results are encouraging they were
all carried out in cultured cells. We next determined whether
RKI-1447 can inhibit tumor growth in an in vivo environment.
To this end, we used the ErbB2 mammary cancer transgenic
mouse model. In this model, the mice harbor the ErbB2 gene
under the control of the MMTV promoter, and spontaneously
develop tumors in their mammary tissues. Mammary tumors
were measured beginning at the time of tumor onset and
treatment (once a day for 14 days) with vehicle (20% HPCD) or
RKI-1447 (200 mpk/day) began when tumor volumes reached
75 to 2,300 mm3. A wide range of tumor volumes was used to
ensure that responses were not volume dependent. Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 show initial volume before treatment, ﬁnal volume at the end of treatment and the percentage
change in tumor volume for 57 tumors from 28 mice treated
with RKI-1447 and 14 tumors from 13 mice treated with
vehicle. The percentage change was calculated from the tumor
volume on the last day of treatment relative to the volume on
the day of initiation of treatment. Figure 7A shows the percentage change in tumor volume for each individual tumor
whereas Fig. 7B shows the average percent change for each
treatment group. Tumors from mice treated with vehicle
increased in size with an average percent change in tumor
volume of 68.3% (Fig. 7B). In contrast, tumors from mice
treated with the RKI-1447 increased in size with an average
percent change in tumor volume of only 8.8% (P < 0.0001).
Thus, RKI-1447 inhibited mammary tumor growth by 87%
([1  (8.8/68.3)]  100), and on average the mammary tumors
from RKI-1447 treated mice were 7.7-fold smaller compared
with those tumors from mice treated with the vehicle control. A
closer look at the data from Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 7A

lead us to divide the RKI-1447 treated group into 3 subgroups:
those tumors that regressed (tumors whose volumes decreased
by 10% or greater—see representative growth curve in Fig. 7C
top right panel), those tumors that continued to grow (tumors
whose volumes increased by 10% or more-see representative
growth curve in Fig. 7C bottom right panel) and those tumors
whose growth was inhibited (tumors whose volume decreased
or increased by less than 10%—see representative growth curve
in Fig. 7C bottom left panel). Figure 7B shows that RKI-1447
treatment caused 20 tumors (35% of the total of 57 tumors
treated) to regress, 14 tumors (25%) to be growth inhibited and
had no effect on the growth of 23 tumors (40%). The 20 tumors
that regressed did by an average of 35.1%. The 23 tumors that
were not affected grew on average by 51.8% similar to the
vehicle treated tumors (average of 68.3%; Fig. 7B). Finally, RKI1447 treatment inhibited the growth of 14 tumors with a
change in volume of only 1.04%. Therefore, as compared with
the vehicle treated group where tumors grew on average 68.3%,
the tumors in this group grew only by 1.04% indicating a 98%
([1  (1.04/68.3)]  100) growth inhibition. Thus, in the
majority (60%) of tumors, RKI-1447 treatment caused either
regression (in 35% of tumors) or tumor growth inhibition (in
25% of tumors). RKI-1447 or vehicle treatments did not result
in mouse weight loss (see Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).

Discussion
Breast cancer accounts for 450,000 of cancer deaths and is
the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide (42). As
with other cancers, metastasis is the major reason breast
cancer patients succumb to this disease. The role of the Rho
family of GTPases in malignant transformation, and particularly the role of RhoA and RhoC in migration, invasion and
metastasis has been well documented both in preclinical
models as well as in human patients (4–6, 8–12). The ability
of RhoA and RhoC to induce migration and invasion is believed
to be mediated primarily through binding and activation of
their effectors ROCK1 and ROCK2 (ROCKs; refs. 14–19, 32). The
RhoA/C-ROCKs pathway has been shown to be elevated in

metastatic tumors as compared with their nonmetastatic
counter parts, and this has been associated with poor prognosis, resistance to therapy and shorter survival time of breast
cancer patients (26, 31). In this manuscript we describe the
discovery of RKI-1447 as a potential anti-invasive and antitumor agent in breast cancer. As control we have used RKI-1313 a
closely related analogue that is a much weaker ROCK inhibitor.
RKI-1447 inhibited potently ROCKs and blocked selectively
ROCK-dependent signaling and morphological changes. Furthermore, RKI-1447 was much more effective than RKI-1313 at
inhibiting breast cancer anchorage-independent growth,
migration and invasion. Finally, RKI-1447 signiﬁcantly inhibited mammary tumor growth in animal models.
The co-crystal structure of the RKI-1447-ROCK1 complex
revealed that RKI-1447 belongs to the Type I class of kinase
inhibitors. The high potency of RKI-1447 is reﬂected in an
elaborate network of noncovalent interactions in the binding
site that involve all inhibitor moieties. This provides a very tight
ﬁt of the entire inhibitor molecule and the ATP site over a
distance of 18 Å. Consequently, a slight modiﬁcation in the
phenyl ring, which is opposite to the hinge-binding pyridine,
disturbs the binding interactions between the inhibitor and
ROCK1 substantially and leads to a signiﬁcant loss of potency
as seen with RKI-1313. Indeed, the hydrogen bond between the
phenyl meta-hydroxyl in RKI-1447 is lacking in RKI-1313, and
this coupled with the steric hindrance caused by the paramethoxy in RKI-1313 offers a possible explanation for the large
difference in potency between RKI-1313 and RKI-1447.
Our studies also showed that RKI-1447 is selective and
inhibited the phosphorylation levels of ROCK substrates such
as MLC-2 and MYPT-1 but not substrates for PAK (Mek), S6K
(S6), and mTORC2 (Akt). This selectivity translated into highly
speciﬁc morphological effects of RKI-1447. Indeed, RKI-1447
inhibited LPA-induced, ROCK-dependent, actin stress ﬁber
formation but not the PAK-dependent, PDGF- and bradykinin-induced lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia formation, respectively. This inhibition of stress ﬁber formation and the resulting
disruption of the cytoskeleton organization suggested that

RKI-1447 might have effects on cell motility, invasion and other
cancer cell characteristics required for metastasis. Our results
clearly show that the ability of breast cancer cells to form
colonies in an anchorage-independent manner in soft agar is
hampered by RKI-1447. Similarly, RKI-1447 was very potent at
inhibiting breast cancer cell migration in a wound healing
assay as well as breast cancer cell invasion through matrigel.
In contrast, RKI-1313 was much less effective at inhibiting
anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion,
consistent with it its very weak activity to inhibit ROCKs
in vitro and in intact cells. The fact that RKI-1313 and RKI1447 are very close analogues structurally coupled with the
fact that their ability to inhibit ROCKs in vitro and in vivo
correlates with their biological effects suggests that the
ability of RKI-1447 to inhibit anchorage-independent
growth, migration and invasion is mediated by its ability
to inhibit ROCKs. Furthermore, the ability of RKI-1447 to
inhibit anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion is most likely not due to inhibition of tumor proliferation because the concentrations that inhibited the former

had little effects on the later. This is not surprising because
several studies have shown that the involvement of ROCKs
in oncogenesis is primarily by mediating invasion and
metastasis and not proliferation of tumors (22–30).
The receptor tyrosine kinase family plays a major role in
breast cancer oncogenesis. In particular, ErbB2 is a signiﬁcant
biomarker that predicts poor prognosis, therapy resistance and
poor survival of breast cancer patients. We have used a
transgenic mouse model where mammary tumor oncogenesis
is driven by ErbB2 to evaluate the effectiveness of RKI-1447 in
vivo. This model has extensively and successfully been used to
evaluate the effects of a variety of agents on mammary tumorigenesis. For example, this model was used to show that the
small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors lapatinib that targets
both ErbB2 and EGFR (43) and geﬁtinib that targets EGFR (44)
inhibited mammary tumorigenesis. Cytotoxic agents such as
the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG (45) and carboplatin (46) as well as
monoclonal antibodies against ErbB2 (47) were also very
effective in this model. In addition, this model was also
successfully used by us to show that the combination of the

RKI-1447, a Potent ROCK Inhibitor with Antitumor Activity

Akt inhibitor TCN-P and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor
Zarnestra is more effective than single agent treatment (41).
In this study, this mammary tumor model was used to show
that RKI-1447 treatment of 28 mice (57 tumors) resulted in an
average tumor growth inhibition of 87%; on average tumors
from mice treated with RKI-1447 were 7.7-fold smaller than
those from mice treated with vehicle. To our knowledge this is
the ﬁrst demonstration that a ROCK inhibitor affects the
growth of mammary tumors in an ErbB2-driven breast cancer
model. The draw back of this antitumor in vivo study is that it
did not investigate metastasis directly. However, the growth of
these mammary tumors as a 3-dimensional mass depends on
their ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner
that is ROCK-dependent and that was potently inhibited
by RKI-1447 in the soft agar studies.
The effect of RKI-1447 in this in vivo model was heterogeneous with 60% of the 57 tumors treated being sensitive and
40% resistant. Among the 34 sensitive tumors, 20 regressed,
and 14 were growth inhibited. There are several potential
mechanisms that could account for these heterogeneous
responses. One possibility could be related to expression levels
of certain biomarkers known to inﬂuence resistant/sensitivity
of beast tumors. For example, the expression levels of estrogen
receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) is often associated with sensitivity/resistance to chemotherapeutic agents
in both preclinical and clinical settings (48–50). However, this
mechanism is unlikely to contribute to the response differences that we have seen as it has been shown that the
mammary tumors in this MMTV-Her2 model all express very
low levels of ER and are PR negative (51). Another mechanism
that could account for the differences in response to RKI-1447
could be related to differences in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) status. In deed, EMT has been shown to
generate cells with properties of stem cells (52), and these can
become resistant to treatment (53). Therefore, it would be of
great interest to evaluate the EMT status in responders compared with nonresponders to RKI-1447. Furthermore, the
tumor stroma plays a pivotal role in breast tumor angiogenesis
and metastasis (54), and differences in the relative tumor
stroma/cancer cell mass could contribute to differences in
responses to RKI-1447. It is also possible that tolerance,
pharmacokinetics and bioavailability inﬂuenced RKI-1447
response, but this is unlikely because these mice are in-bred

and should behave similarly with regards to these parameters.
Understanding the mechanisms of resistance will pave the way
to designing combination therapies of RKIs with other antisignaling agents including ErbB2 inhibitors and ErbB2 neutralizing antibodies.
In summary, we have designed a highly potent and selective
ROCK Type 1 inhibitor that binds to the ATP site of ROCK 1 at
the hinge region and the DFG motif. RKI-1447 but not its
closely related analogue RKI-1313 was highly effective at
inhibiting ROCK-dependent signaling, cytoskeletal changes,
anchorage-independent colony formation, migration, and
invasion. Finally, RKI-1447 inhibited tumor growth and caused
tumor regression in animal models with little side effects. Our
studies warrant further advanced preclinical studies to determine the suitability of RKI-1447 as a potential clinical
candidate.
