ABSTRACT
Poor prognosis and frequent relapses are major challenges for patients with
high-risk neuroblastoma (NB), especially when tumors show MYCN amplification.
High-dose chemotherapy triggers apoptosis, necrosis and senescence, a cellular
stress response leading to permanent proliferative arrest and a typical senescenceassociated secretome (SASP). SASP components reinforce growth-arrest and act
immune-stimulatory, while others are tumor-promoting. We evaluated whether
metronomic, i.e. long-term, repetitive low-dose, drug treatment induces senescence
in vitro and in vivo. And importantly, by using the secretome as a discriminator for
beneficial versus adverse effects of senescence, drugs with a tumor-inhibiting SASP
were identified.
We demonstrate that metronomic application of chemotherapeutic drugs
induces therapy-induced senescence, characterized by cell cycle arrest, p21WAF/CIP1
up-regulation and DNA double-strand breaks selectively in MYCN-amplified NB. Lowdose topotecan (TPT) was identified as an inducer of a favorable SASP while lacking
NFKB1/p50 activation. In contrast, Bromo-deoxy-uridine induced senescent NB-cells
secret a tumor-promoting SASP in a NFKB1/p50-dependent manner. Importantly,
TPT-treated senescent tumor cells act growth-inhibitory in a dose-dependent manner
on non-senescent tumor cells and MYCN expression is significantly reduced in vitro
and in vivo. Furthermore, in a mouse xenotransplant-model for MYCN-amplified NB
metronomic TPT leads to senescence selectively in tumor cells, complete or partial
remission, prolonged survival and a favorable SASP.
This new mode-of-action of metronomic TPT treatment, i.e. promoting a tumorinhibiting type of senescence in MYCN-amplified tumors, is clinically relevant as
metronomic regimens are increasingly implemented in therapy protocols of various
cancer entities and are considered as a feasible maintenance treatment option with
moderate adverse event profiles.

aberrations [3–6]. Despite intensive multi-modal treatment,
recent developments in immunotherapy and inclusion of
novel targeted drugs in clinical studies, the prognosis of
children with high-risk neuroblastoma is still poor, with a
median 5-year overall survival between 50 and 70 percent
[7–9]. Thus, there is a high interest in new therapeutic
strategies that will prevent relapse and improve outcome.
In addition to apoptosis and autophagy,
chemotherapeutic agents causing DNA damage result
in therapy-induced senescence (TIS), a state of stable
proliferative arrest, in vitro and in vivo [10]. The
physiological and pathophysiological role of cellular
senescence includes organogenesis during embryonic
development [11, 12] and organismal aging [13] as well
as removal of damaged cells, as seen upon oncogeneactivation in pre-malignant lesions preventing tumor
initiation [14]. Even, established tumors gradually regress
in vivo when senescence is induced by p53 restoration
or oncogene inactivation [15–17]. In contrast, senescent
stromal cells, i.e. fibroblasts, stimulate the proliferation
of premalignant and malignant epithelial cells in culture,
and the tumorigenicity of premalignant cells in mouse
xenografts [18]. Thus, it is unclear whether TIS – affecting
probably both, tumor and stroma – will have tumorpromoting or -inhibiting effects.
Cellular senescence is defined by several
features, most importantly, cell cycle arrest accompanied
by p21WAF/CIP1 and p16Ink4a up-regulation, DNA-damage
response (DDR), global chromatin remodeling and
epigenetic changes and a characteristic senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (SASP) [13, 19–22].
Transcription of SASP factors mainly depend on p38MAPK
and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signaling [23, 24].
SASP components of senescent normal cells, oncogene
induced senescent premalignant cells and TIS tumor cells
comprise autocrine and paracrine factors reinforcing the
senescence phenotype, including growth arrest. On the
other hand, the SASP includes pro-inflammatory cytokines,
growth factors and tissue remodeling enzymes that might
act as tumor-promoters [19, 25, 26]. However, SASPcomposition differs depending on the genomic background,
cell type and senescence trigger. Thus, affecting immune
response, apoptotic, angiogenic and mitogenic properties
of nearby cells in different ways [20].
TIS has been studied extensively in vitro, but in
vivo data are limited and contradictory. Especially the
correlation of TIS with outcome in cancer patients is
unclear [27–29]. Currently, several approaches are under
investigation to exploit the tumor-inhibiting effects
of senescence as cancer therapy [30]. Up until now,
studies have focused on TIS induced upon conventional,
high-dose cytotoxic drug treatment in vitro and in vivo.
Metronomic, continuous low-dose drug application might
also induce TIS. In addition, treatment-related toxic
side effects are likely to be reduced under metronomic,
low-dose drug schedules. However, current evidence
is limited to in vitro studies. We have previously shown
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that long-term low-dose-treatment with hydroxyurea
(HU), a ribonuclease reductase inhibitor, induces
senescence in primary NB cell lines in vitro [31]. This
prompted us to screen for additional drugs that induce
tumor cell senescence without inducing tumor-promoting
properties, such as the unfavorable compartment of the
SASP. We further aimed to explore senescence induction
by metronomic drug treatment as a new therapeutic
strategy for high-risk NB. Therefore, we established an
in vivo model for low-dose therapy-induced senescence
and studied tumor-inhibiting versus -promoting roles of
senescent NB-tumor cells and the underlying mechanism
in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
Long-term, low-dose drug treatment results in
cell cycle arrest and senescence in aggressive
primary neuroblastoma cell lines
In initial dose-finding experiments 12 candidate
drugs (Table 1), targeting cell cycle regulation and/
or inducing DNA damage, were tested for inhibition
of cell proliferation in 6 MYCN-amplified (MNA)
and  5  non-amplified (nonMNA) NB cell lines (Suppl.
Table S1). Two MNA and two nonMNA cell lines showing
intermediate drug sensitivities among the cell lines tested
were selected for further testing (Table 1 and Suppl.
Table S2). Camptothecin (CPT), its derivative topotecan
(TPT), distamycin A (DMA), mitoxantrone (MIT),
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (CIS) and the previously
published senescence inducers, HU and 5-Bromo2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU), were tested for induction of
senescence in long-term cultures (three weeks) at three
different concentrations around the IC50 values (Suppl.
Table S2). DMA, MIT, 5-FU and CIS induced cell death,
but did not yield senescent cells (Suppl. Table S2).
However, HU, CPT, TPT and BrdU treatment resulted – in
addition to cell death (Suppl. Figure S1a) - in senescence
in both MNA, STA-NB-10 and CLB-Ma, but not in the
two nonMNA cell lines (Suppl. Table S2 and Figure 1).
Senescent cells had a strongly reduced DNA-synthesis
rate, an enlarged, flat morphology, and high senescenceassociated-beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) positivity
(Figure 1a and 1b). This shows that 4/12 drugs tested, i.e.
HU, CPT, TPT and BrdU, lead, in addition to cell death,
to senescence in aggressive MNA NB-cell lines, but not in
nonMNA cell lines.

Topotecan induces a favorable SASP
independent of NFKB1/p50 activation
Senescent normal cells and neoplastic cells have
been reported to produce metastasis- and angiogenesispromoting factors as part of their SASP [26]. As
secretion of these tumor-promoting factors shall be
avoided, HU-treated senescent (HUsen), CPTsen and
3572

BrdUsen STA-NB-10 cells were analyzed for their
secretome. Among the top 40 differentially secreted
proteins, a cluster of 12 growth factors and cytokines
highly associated with aggressiveness was exclusively
secreted at high levels in the BrdUsen cells, but not
in the HUsen or CPTsen or the untreated control cells
(Figure 1c). Further quantification confirmed that only
BrdUsen STA-NB-10 cells secreted the metastasis-related
factors MCP-3/CCL7 and MMP-9, the pro-inflammatory
protein RANTES and angiogenesis-inducing VEGFA.
In contrast, the immune-stimulatory IL-6 and NBfavorable PDGF-AA are secreted by HUsen, CPTsen and
BrdUsen cells (Figure 1d). A similar, but slightly distinct,
secretion pattern was observed for the CLB-Ma cell line
(Figure 1d). Further gene expression profiling confirmed
differences in cellular responses as mRNA expression
profiles of HUsen TPTsen and CPTsen are similar and
clustered more closely together in contrast to BrdUsen,
which clustered more distant in both cell lines analyzed
(Figure 1e). In contrast to long-term TPT treated cells,
short, 5 days, treatment, or all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)
which mainly induces neuronal-like differentiation in
NB, leads only to limited expression changes (Figure
1e). These data illustrate that drug-induced senescent
NB-cells undergo similar global expression changes,
but secretion of predominantly tumor-promoting SASP
factors was confined to BrdUsen cells.
The transcription of SASP factors was reported
to be dependent on the activation of the NFκB and/or
p38MAPK pathway [23, 24]. Thus, activation of these
pathways was investigated in TPTsen and BrdUsen cells.
p38MAPK was phosphorylated in both, TPTsen and
BrdUsen cells. However, NFKB1/p50 was up-regulated
and showed nuclear localization only in BrdUsen, but
not in TPTsen cells (Figure 2a and 2b). The NFKB1/p50
hetero-dimerisation partner RelA/p65 was not increased
(Figure 2a and 2c), suggesting that nuclear NFKB1/p50 is
required for the transcription of unfavorable SASP factors
in BrdUsen cells. SiRNA mediated silencing of NFKB1
reduced secretion of two NFκB target genes, MCP-3
and RANTES, significantly, but did not affect VEGFA
([32, 33] and Figure 2d and 2e). Also pharmacological
inhibition of IKKβ, a kinase up-stream of NFKB1/p50,
by BMS345541 similarly interfered with MCP-3 and
RANTES secretion (Figure 2e). Importantly, these data
demonstrate that TPTsen cells produce a more favorable
SASP than BrdUsen cells and this is most likely due to a
lack of NFKB1/p50 activation.

whether DDBs are present in response to the relatively
low doses, i.e. 5 nM TPT applied, nuclear γH2AX foci
were analyzed in short-term (4 days) and long-term
(3 weeks) TPT treated STA-NB-10 cells. Upon shortterm TPT treatment the mean spot count was 3-fold
higher as compared to untreated control cells; in longterm TPT treated senescent NB-cells the spot count was
2.2-fold higher, but with a high variance (0 to 70 spots
per nucleus) (Figure 3a and 3b). These data indicate
that DDB are induced in response to low-dose TPT.
Interestingly, some TPTsen cells contain several, small to
large micronuclei densely packed with γH2AX positive
DNA material (Figure 3a, lower panel), illustrating
the elimination of irreparable DNA by packaging in
micronuclei. In addition, TPTsen cells up-regulated
p21WAF/CIP1, but not p16Ink4a in response to DNA damage
(Figure 3c and Suppl. Figure S1b) and – in line with
previous observations in senescent NB cells [31, 35] MYCN mRNA and protein expression was abrogated
(Figure 3d and 3e).

TPTsen NB cells inhibit growth of non-senescent
NB cells in co-cultures in vitro
HU, CPT and TPTsen cells do not secrete a panel
of unfavorable, tumor-promoting factors (Figure 1).
Thus, we next investigated whether TPTsen cells
act tumor-inhibiting or tumor-promoting, i.e. affect
proliferation of non-senescent NB-cells in vitro. As cell
cycle and surface marker stainings cannot be combined
with SA-β-Gal staining for FACS analysis, we first
confirmed CD44, known to be up-regulated in TIS NB
cells, as an adequate surrogate FACS marker to identify
senescent NB-cells ([31], Figure 3f and Suppl. Figure
S2a). Next, TPTsen cells were co-cultivated with control
NB-cells at different ratios for 7 days (Figure 3g and
3h). In TPTsen cells EdU incorporation and Ki-67 were
drastically reduced (Figure 3h and Suppl. Figure S2b).
In co-cultures, the CD44 negative fraction, containing
mainly untreated, non-senescent NB-cells, showed
significantly reduced EdU incorporation in a dosedependent manner – the more TPTsen cells present, the
stronger the anti-proliferative effect (Figure 3h). This
proves that TPTsen tumor cells do not promote growth
of non-senescent neighboring tumor cells but rather
reduce their proliferation making TPT a good candidate
for further in vivo testing.

models including NB at various doses (0.2 – 2 mg/
kg/d), however, TIS was not analyzed and treatment
schemes usually consisted of several cycles of treatment
including treatment breaks [36, 37]. As our in vitro data
support TPT as a senescence-inducing drug, when added
continuously at relatively low doses (5 nM), for in vivo
analysis doses ranging from 0.01 to 1 mg/kg/d were
applied i.p. daily without treatment break (Figure 4a).
According to pharmacodynamics data, 0.1 mg/kg/d yields
tissue levels of approximately 5 nM, equivalent to the TPT
concentrations used in vitro [36]. As, to our knowledge,
no syngeneic mouse model exists for NB having a MYCN
amplification, a xenograft model was established by
transplanting the human MNA low passage cell line STANB-10 subcutaneously in CD1:Foxn1nu/nu mice. Treatment
was started when the mean longest axis of the xenotransplanted tumors exceeded 1 cm (Figure 4a).
In control mice, tumors reached the endpoint
criteria (d ≥ 2 cm) within 14–22 days. When mice were
treated for 6 or 15 weeks with 0.1 mg/kg/d TPT, complete
(69% at 6 weeks; 91% at 15 weeks) and partial tumor
remission, respectively were observed in all animals.

6 weeks 0.1 mg/kg/d treatment led to prolonged survival
for another 22–46 days after treatment had been stopped
(Figure 4b). If prolonged to 15 weeks, 45% stayed tumorfree for ≥ 300 days (Figure 4b). At week 2 of treatment,
tumor size was reduced in a drug-dose dependent manner
(Figure 4c). Importantly, in 0.1 mg/kg/d TPT exposed
tumors the proportion of SA-β-Gal positive cells and
CDKN1A (p21WAF/CIP1) mRNA expression was significantly
elevated over control, 0.03 or 0.01 mg/kg/d TPT, however
only slightly in the 1 mg/kg/d treatment group (Figure
4d and 4e). Notably, stromal cells of murine origin, i.e.
endothelial cells, fibroblasts and tumor infiltrating immune
cells, did not show altered SA-β-Gal activity in any of the
treatment groups (Suppl. Figure S3a). Treatment-related
toxic side effects, such as weight loss, splenomegaly or
treatment-related deaths have not been observed in the
long-term metronomic (0.1 mg/kg/d TPT) treated animals
(Suppl. Figure S3b).
Thus, we were able to establish a MNA NB in vivo
model for metronomic drug-induced senescence, showing
that, when applied at low doses in vivo, i.e. 0.1 mg/kg/d,
TPT triggers senescence in a considerably big proportion

the same extent in response to 0.1 and 0.03 mg/kg/d TPT
treatment (Figure 4f), but only in the 0.1 mg/kg/d treatment
group senescence was detected in a high proportion of cells
(Figure 4d). This indicates that in the 0.1 mg/kg/d dose
group senescence probably contributes - in addition to
apoptosis - to tumor remission. Next, we evaluated features
of aggressiveness in TPT exposed and control tumors,
including MYCN expression and proliferative activity. In
line with the in vitro observation, MYCN expression was
diminished by 60% (Figure 4g) and Ki-67 was lower in 0.1
mg/kg/d TPT-exposed tumors (Figure 5a).

Continuous low-dose topotecan reduces tumor
aggressiveness and does not trigger expression of
unfavorable SASP components in vivo
Previously, apoptosis of tumor cells and reduction
of tumor vascularization have been considered as the main
mechanisms of action of TPT, leading to tumor shrinkage
in vivo [38, 39]. Interestingly, apoptosis was elevated to

It is tempting to speculate that, based on our in vitro data,
pharmacological inhibition of the NFκB pathway could
reduce some of the tumor-promoting aspects caused by
certain drugs, especially when applied at high dose or in a
multi-modal setting.
While our data strongly suggest that part of the
unfavorable secretome in BrdUsen NB is dependent on
NFKB1, VEGFA production was not affected by NFKB1
silencing nor by pharmacological inhibition. In addition,
VEGFA expression and vascularization was strongly
reduced in metronomic TPT exposed tumors, an effect
described earlier for TPT. It has been shown that TPT
reduces HIF-1α expression leading to decreased VEGF
also in NB and is associated with tumor shrinkage [48–
50]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that hypoxia
suppresses senescence in normal and cancer cell lines
[51]. Thus, DNA-damage induction and alleviation of
hypoxic stress by TPT may both contribute to enable and
induce senescence.
Metronomic drug application uses continuous
low doses of drugs and has been proven effective in
phase I and II clinical trials in adult and pediatric solid
tumor patients [52–54]. This treatment modality has
been assumed to induce tumor cell dormancy and target
the tumor microenvironment by reducing the tumor
vasculature and by restoring immune surveillance while
having little side effects [55], however, the contribution of
tumor cell senescence has not been investigated. We here
provide evidence that tumor cell senescence might be a
major contributor to the tumor-inhibiting effects observed
upon low-dose metronomic TPT in MYCN-amplified
tumors (Figure 5d).
TPTsen cells show down-regulation of MYCN
expression in vitro and in vivo. Extra-chromosomal MYCN
amplicons have been shown to be subjected to micronucleusmediated oncogene elimination during TIS and in
spontaneously occurring senescent tumor cells in NB
[31, 35]. Another mechanism of MYCN down-regulation
may involve transcriptional silencing by epigenetic
changes taking place during senescence, as exemplified
by the formation of repressive heterochromatin at several
loci encoding for pro-proliferative genes [57, 58]. In turn,
MYCN-down-regulation may itself cause senescence as has
been demonstrated for c-myc inactivation [16].
In our in vitro cultures we have not observed
senescent cells to resume growth upon drug withdrawal,
however, a low proportion of cells may cycle very slowly
as indicated by low-level DNA-synthesis. It has formerly
been shown in vitro that replicative senescent fibroblasts
having depleted p53 can escape senescence and re-enter
cell cycle [59]. It is speculated that upon therapy cancer
cells that have accumulated additional mutations relieving
cell cycle block might be capable of bypassing or even
escaping senescence. Despite these pitfalls, in our study
metronomic TPT-induced senescence is associated with
tumor remission and prolonged survival. To further reduce

Evaluation of SASP expression in our in vivo
model showed that while several senescence-associated
markers were up-regulated in 0.1 mg/kg/d TPT exposed
tumors, NFKB1/p50 and SASP-components which
were exclusively up-regulated in BrdUsen cells in vitro,
i.e. unfavorable factors, were not up-regulated upon
metronomic TPT in vivo (Figure 1c and 5b). In turn,
some of the factors typical for TPTsen cells in vitro, were
up-regulated in vivo as well (Figure 5b). Also, metronomic
TPT treatment led to a decreased VEGFA expression and
reduced tumor vascularization (Figure 5b and 5c). Thus,
our in vivo data support the notion that metronomic TPT
induces senescence in a MNA NB model without upregulation of NFKB1/p50 and production of a tumorpromoting SASP.

DISCUSSION
Evidence is accumulating that senescence
contributes to cure in various murine and human
malignancies [15–17, 27, 28, 40, 41]. We here provide
evidence that metronomic, low dose topotecan treatment
leads to DNA-damage, p21WAF/CIP1 up-regulation,
senescence and tumor regression in vitro and in vivo
selectively in MNA NB cells. Topotecan was identified
in a small-scale drug screen. By using the SASP as a
discriminator for beneficial versus adverse effects of
senescence, we successfully screened for drugs that induce
a favorable SASP and tumor growth-inhibitory- rather than
growth-promoting properties, as demonstrated in coculture experiments (Figure 5d). The transition to a more
favorable phenotype is accompanied by a reduction of
MYCN protein, frequently overexpressed in MNA tumors
and a marker for bad prognosis. Thus, we propose that
metronomic TPT induces a favorable type of senescence
in MYCN-amplified NB which could be exploited in new
therapeutic protocols.
Previous reports have mainly focused on the
potential harmful nature of factors secreted by senescent
cells. Anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative effects of
senescent fibrosarcoma cell supernatants have been
demonstrated in previous co-culture experiments [42].
Here, we identified drugs, HU, CPT and TPT that do
not involve secretion of unfavorable SASP factors,
such as MMP-9, MCP-3, RANTES and VEGF, but still
induce senescence in vitro and in vivo. The fact that
different drugs trigger alternative senescence pathways
and cause differences in the secretion profile is in line
with earlier observations [43, 44], but this study is the
first to exploit this in a drug screen. Regulation of the
SASP by NFκB is well established in several cell models
[45–47]. We demonstrate that the massive production of
tumor-promoting secreted factors in BrdUsen cells is, at
least partly, due to the activation of the NFκB-pathway
probably involving NFKB1/p50 homodimers, but not
RelA/p65 as e.g. in ras-induced senescent fibroblasts [46].

relapses, future studies shall combine senescence inducing
drugs with drugs targeting metabolic pathways hyperactive
in senescence or DNA-repair, e.g. PARP1 inhibitors
[60, 61]. Another option may be to boost paracrine activity
of infiltrating CD4+ effector cells reinforcing senescence
or NK-cell mediated clearance of senescent tumor cells
[62, 63]. Such combination treatments could enhance the

proportion of senescent cells, stabilize cell cycle arrest
and/or enable elimination of senescent tumor cells.
Here, we demonstrate in a proof-of-principle study
that low dose metronomic TPT does not elicit a tumorpromoting, but rather tumor-inhibiting senescence
phenotype due to a lack of NFKB1/p50 activation and
leads to tumor remission in an animal model for the MYCN

SA-β-Gal staining, immunofluorescence
and iFISH

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SA-β-Gal staining on cultured cells or tumor touch
slides was carried out at pH 5.0 using the Senescence
Detection Kit (Biovision, USA) as described [31]. Cultured
SA-β-Gal stained cells were imaged using an Axiovert 40C
microscope (Zeiss, Austria) and a digital camera (PL-A662;
Pixelink, USA). 300 cells/sample were examined for SAβ-Gal positivity by three independent researchers. Tumor
touch slides were stained in duplicate, counterstained with
DAPI, pseudonymized and allocated into three classes: low
(0–10% SA-β-Gal positive of all tumor cells), intermediate
(10–30%) and high positivity (30–100%).
Immunofluorescence stainings were performed
on 4 μm cryo-sections or cytospin preparations from
in vitro cultivated cells as described [31]. Briefly, slides
were fixed with 4% PFA or methanol-acetone (1:1)
and, for detection of nuclear antigens, permeabilized
with 0.1% TritonX-100, 0.1% SDS, PBS or 0.3%
TritonX-100. Primary antibodies were applied as
indicated by the manufacturer (Suppl. Table S3). GD2
antibody (ch14.18) was FITC labelled as described in
[31]. Secondary antibodies: anti-m-Cy3, anti-rb-FITC
(Dianova) or -AF594, anti-r-AF594 (Life Technologies).
For F-actin, 100 nM Phalloidin-TRITC was incubated
for 30 min, at RT. TUNEL staining was performed
using the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL kit (Promega,
Austria) according to the manual.
Confocal images were acquired with a 63x objective
at a Leica TCS SP8X laser scanning microscope using
the software package LAS AF 4.0.0 (Leica, Germany).
Automated image acquisition was done on an Axioplan
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) coupled to a motor-driven
stage (Maerzhaeuser, Germany) with a 63x objective using
the Metafer Software (V 3.8.6., Metasystems, Germany).
Ki-67, γH2AX and p21 were quantified on 100–150
images/sample as described [65, 66]. Quantified cellular
properties were nuclear size, nuclear roundness, mean
signal intensity, signal background intensity and nuclear
spot count. For Ki-67 cells were allocated into six classes
according to cell cycle stages based on [67]. Image
scatter plots are used to visualize clipped cellular images
(combined fluorescence channels), based on iCluster [68].
Images are sorted along the axes using quantified features.
CD31 was quantified on 30 random images by Image J
(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download. html) and cumulative
vessel lengths were calculated. TUNEL positive cells
were quantified by counting positive cells in five areas
of comparable cell density by three researchers. MYCN
interphase-FISH was carried out on cytospin preparations
as previously described [31].

mRNA expression analysis
Fresh frozen tumors were homogenized in Trizol
(Invitrogen, Austria) by using the MACS Dissociator
(Miltenyi, Germany) and total RNA was isolated
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 104–106 in
vitro cultivated cells were used for mRNA-extraction
using the miRNEasy kit (Qiagen, Germany). RNA
concentration was measured on a Nanodrop ND-1000
(Peqlab, Austria) and RNA integrity was determined by
an Experion System (Experion RNA StdSens Analysis
Kit, Bio-Rad, Austria) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Following DNAseI digestion and RNA cleanup (RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit, Qiagen), 200 ng
RNA was used for the Primeview Expression Kit
(Gene Chip 3′IVT Express Kit, Affymetrix, Austria)
and gene expression analysis was performed according
to the manufacturer’s manual. Further analysis was
done in R using Bioconductor packages [70]. CEL files
were normalized using the RMA algorithm [71] and
the probeset with the highest variance across samples
was chosen for further analysis. Microarray data were
deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE59298).
Qlucore Omics Explorer 3.1 (Qlucore, Sweden) was used
for PCA analysis and hierarchical clustering.
For quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), 200 ng of
mRNA was used for cDNA synthesis using oligo dT20
primer (VbC Biotech, Austria) and M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For qPCR 5 ng cDNA was amplified using
the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix

Despite recent promising advances in refining multimodal (targeted) cancer therapies and immunotherapy,
prognosis remains poor for many aggressive cancer
entities, such as high-risk neuroblastoma. High-dose
DNA-damage inducing drugs cause apoptosis, necrosis and
senescence. The latter is a cellular stress response, leading
to cell cycle exit and the formation of a typical senescence
associated secretory phenotype (SASP), that comprises
tumor-promoting as well as –inhibiting components
shaping the tumor microenvironment. By chosing drugs
creating a tumor-inhibiting type of senescence, such as
topotecan, and applying them at a metronomic, i.e. longterm, repetitive low-dose treatment schedule we achieved
complete or partial rermission and prolonged survival
in xenotransplanted mice with well established tumors
grown from low-passage high-risk MYCN-amplified
patient derived cell lines. We here provide a new modeof-action of metronomic regimens which are increasingly
implemented in therapy protocols of various cancer entities
and are considered as a feasible maintenance treatment
option with moderate adverse event profiles.
