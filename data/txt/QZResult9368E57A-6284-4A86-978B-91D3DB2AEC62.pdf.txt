ABSTRACT
The constant presence of the viral genome in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated
gastric cancers (EBVaGCs) suggests the applicability of novel EBV-targeted therapies.
The antiviral nucleoside drug, ganciclovir (GCV), is effective only in the context of the
viral lytic cycle in the presence of EBV-encoded thymidine kinase (TK)/protein kinase
(PK) expression. In this study, screening of the Johns Hopkins Drug Library identified
gemcitabine as a candidate for combination treatment with GCV. Pharmacological
induction of EBV-TK or PK in EBVaGC-originated tumor cells were used to study
combination treatment with GCV in vitro and in vivo. Gemcitabine was found to be a
lytic inducer via activation of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/p53 genotoxic
stress pathway in EBVaGC. Using an EBVaGC mouse model and a [125I] fialuridine
(FIAU)-based lytic activation imaging system, we evaluated gemcitabine-induced
lytic activation in an in vivo system and confirmed the efficacy of gemcitabine-GCV
combination treatment. This viral enzyme-targeted anti-tumor strategy may provide
a new therapeutic approach for EBVaGCs.

poorer prognosis [3–5]; however, a recent retrospective
study revealed that EBV positivity in gastric cancer is
associated with lower mortality and provides an additional
prognostic indicator [2]. In addition to the conventional
chemotherapy and surgical treatments, many EBVpositive malignancy experimental treatments are aimed at
targeting the EBV episome, inhibiting EBV-transforming
proteins, EBV-dependent expression of cellular toxins,
and modulation of immune responses with EBV-specific
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) [6, 7]. Recent studies

INTRODUCTION
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a double-stranded DNA
human gamma herpes virus that establishes a persistent
infection in over 90% of individuals. Most infections
are self-limiting, but some cases are associated with the
development of malignancies of lymphoid or epithelial
origin [1]. EBV-associated gastric carcinomas (EBVaGCs)
make up about 9% of all stomach cancers [2]. The presence
of EBV in lymphoma or leukemia is known to confer a

based on the concept of selective destruction of tumor
cells have suggested that the induction of lytic activation
in EBV-associated tumors and combination treatment
with the antiviral agent ganciclovir (GCV) represents a
potential anti-cancer treatment modality [7–10].
GCV is efficiently phosphorylated and activated
by the viral thymidine kinase (TK) or protein kinase
(PK) [11, 12]. Phosphorylated GCV interferes with
subsequent cellular DNA synthesis, resulting in apoptotic
cell death [13, 14]. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-TK/
GCV cytotoxic gene therapy is effective in vitro, but the
gene delivery of HSV-TK is problematic in vivo [15].
Endogenous EBV-TK or EBV-PK (referred to as EBVTK/PK) induced during lytic activation in EBV-associated
tumors, however, may provide an alternative strategy [16].
Therefore, identification of the reagents that can induce
lytic activation in EBV-associated tumors is critical.
Several pharmacological agents are known to induce
lytic activation via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or
genotoxic stress response in EBV-infected cells [8, 9,
17–19]. We screened the Johns Hopkins Drug Library
(JHDL) to find clinically applicable new drugs as a drug
repositioning approach [20]. From this screen, we selected
gemcitabine (2, 2-difluorodeoxycytidine, dFdC; Gemzar),
which has been used in various cancer therapeutic
regimens [21–24]. Gemcitabine has been shown to be a
lytic inducer with therapeutic potential in EBV-positive B
cell lymphoma cell lines and nasopharyngeal carcinoma
cell lines [8, 25], but this drug has not been examined with
respect to the precise mechanism of lytic activation in the
context of EBVaGC.
In this study, we determined the dose of gemcitabine
required for the induction of EBV lytic activation and
explored the mechanism of this drug. Moreover, we
determined whether gemcitabine-GCV combination
treatment was effective in inducing cell death in SNU-719
cells, a gastric cancer cell line that is naturally infected
with EBV. We established an EBVaGC-bearing mouse
model and [125I]-1-(2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-arabinofuranosyl)5-iodouracil (FIAU)-based molecular imaging to evaluate
gemcitabine-induced lytic activation and gemcitabineGCV combination treatment in vivo. The effectiveness of
combination therapy was confirmed in vivo by this mouse
model and imaging system.

showing significantly increased luciferase activity when
compared with control (Supplementary Table S1).
Validation experiments were performed on the upper 15%
(29 drugs, bold lettering in Supplementary Table S1).
Gemcitabine was identified as an ideal candidate for
further evaluation. Treatment of the EBVaGC cell line
SNU-719 and the EBV-negative gastric cancer (EBVnGC)
cell line MKN-74 with gemcitabine as scheduled in
Figure 1A revealed that the EBV immediate early (IE)
lytic protein Zta was induced in SNU-719 cells even at
a low dose (5 ng/ml; Figure 1B). Zta protein expression
was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (IFA)
(Figure 1C). Moreover, this effect was observed beginning
48 h after gemcitabine treatment (Supplementary Figure
S1A and S1B). To determine whether the low dose of
gemcitabine induces other lytic genes, we performed
RT-PCR to evaluate the induction of BGLF4 (EBV-PK)
and BXLF1 (EBV-TK). These genes exhibited a similar
expression pattern to that of BZLF1, which encodes the
Zta (Figure 1D). Additionally, a component of virion,
gp350, was detected only in lytic activation-induced SNU719 cells (Figure 1E).
The ER or genotoxic stress response is associated
with EBV lytic activation [18, 26]. Moreover, the ataxia
telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase/p53 pathway is
activated during genotoxic stress-induced EBV lytic
activation [18]. We first screened for the involvement of
the ER stress response during gemcitabine-induced lytic
activation, but C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and
glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78), which are known
ER stress markers, exhibited no differences between
SNU-719 and MKN-74 cells following gemcitabine
treatment (Supplementary Figure S2). We next evaluated
lytic activation in the context of ATM/p53 activation.
SNU-719 cells have wild-type TP53 [27], yielding an
intact ATM/p53 pathway. Serine 1981 of ATM was
phosphorylated 3 h after gemcitabine treatment, and serine
15 of p53 was phosphorylated subsequently (Figure 1F).
Phosphorylated p53 was decreased following treatment
with the ATM inhibitor KU55933 (Figure 1G), which may
have suppressed Zta expression as previously reported
[18]. To further evaluate the involvement of the ATM/
p53 pathway in lytic activation, we performed siRNAbased knock-down experiments. Phosphorylation of p53
was decreased by si-ATM, resulting in a decrease of Zta
protein expression (Figure 1H). Moreover, this finding
was confirmed by si-TP53 (Figure 1I). Collectively, these
results suggest that gemcitabine induces lytic activation
via the ATM/p53-mediated genotoxic stress pathway in
SNU-719 cells.

that could induce lytic activation in EBVaGCs by highthroughput screening of JHDL using EBV BZLF1

was measured using the radio-isotope labeled-nucleoside
analogue, [125I] FIAU [28]. Cellular accumulation of
[125I] FIAU showed a positive correlation with the dose of
gemcitabine in SNU-719 cells but not in MKN-74 cells
(Figure 2A).
We examined the concentration of gemcitabine
that induced lytic activation while minimizing cell death
as gemcitabine is currently used as a chemotherapeutic
drug in various kinds of cancers [21–24]. The inhibition
of cell proliferation by 50% (IC50) for MKN-74 cells
was 2.2–3.8 ng/ml, which is similar to the concentration
previously reported [22], while that of SNU-719 cells
(8.4–16.8 ng/ml) was slightly higher (Figure 2B). Thus,
the induction of lytic activation in SNU-719 cells by 5
ng/ml gemcitabine occurred at a level below the IC50.
To establish a combination treatment protocol with
gemcitabine and GCV, we first treated cells with GCV
alone. Little difference in the response of SNU-719 and
MKN-74 cells to GCV treatment was noted, and GCV had
little influence on both cell types even at a relatively high
concentration (100 μg/ml; Figure 2C).
The cytotoxicity of the combination treatment was
evaluated under an optimized schedule as described in
Figure 2D. This schedule was based on the toxicity and
short half-life (8–17 min) of gemcitabine [29]. Gemcitabine
conferred cytotoxicity on GCV in SNU719 cells but
not in MKN-74 cells (Figure 2E and 2F). GCV worked
more efficiently in concert with the low concentration of
gemcitabine. That is, the decrease in cell survival was
more profound at 0.1–10 ng/ml than at 10–100 ng/ml.
GCV did not exert an additional effect at gemcitabine
concentrations of 1 μg/ml. GCV induced maximum
efficacy when 100 μg/ml GCV was combined with
lytic activation-inducible concentrations (1–100 ng/ml)
of gemcitabine in vitro. Taken together, a low dose
of gemcitabine combined with GCV is an efficacious
combination treatment option in these cells.

(Supplementary Figure S3C) and EBV-encoded small
RNAs (EBER)-in situ hybridization (ISH) (Supplementary
Figure S3D).
Next, we tested whether gemcitabine induced
functional EBV lytic proteins in this mouse model. The
gemcitabine concentration commonly used in cancer
therapy for human is 20–60 μM (i.e., 5.2–15.6 μg/ml)
in plasma, and such levels are achieved by infusion of
drug at a dose of 1,000–1,200 mg/m2 [29]. For our mouse
model, gemcitabine was used with a much lower dose than
used in cancer therapy, and induced Zta in SNU-719 cellimplanted tumors (referred to as SNU-719 tumors) in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). BGLF4 and BXLF1
were also induced in SNU-719 tumors (Figure 3B) as
observed in the in vitro system. We used [125I] FIAU-based
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
planar imaging to confirm the induction of functional
EBV-TK/PK in SNU-719 tumors. The intensity of the
[125I] FIAU signal showed a positive correlation with the
dose of gemcitabine, whereas this signal was not detected
in MKN-74 cell-implanted tumors (referred to as MKN74 tumors) (Figure 3C). This result was confirmed by
imaging of isolated tumors (Figure 3D).

Efficient gemcitabine-GCV combination
treatment in the EBVaGC mouse model
The ability of gemcitabine to induce EBV-TK/PK
in the mouse model system led us to test combination
treatment with GCV. Approximately 1 × 107 SNU719 cells or 2 × 106 MKN-74 cells were engrafted
subcutaneously in the right flank of NOD-SCID mice.
When the tumors reached approximately 1,000 mm3, the
mice were treated with the indicated dose of gemcitabine
or GCV as scheduled (Figure 4A). A dose of 10 mg/kg
gemcitabine and 25 mg/kg GCV had little influence on
tumor growth in MKN-74 cell-engrafted mice; however,
the same dose of gemcitabine, alone or in combination
with GCV, resulted in gradual regression of tumors until
the tumors were no longer palpable in SNU-719 cellengrafted mice (Figure 4B and 4C). Mice treated with
gemcitabine only and the gemcitabine-GCV combination
lost body weight severely, which made the experiment
discontinue after 3 cycles in accordance with IACUC
guidelines (Figure 4D). Therefore, we sought to identify a
gemcitabine concentration that produced synergism with
GCV without inducing adverse effects. The combination
of 0.5 mg/kg gemcitabine and 25 mg/kg GCV with
the same schedule suppressed the growth of tumors
significantly (Figure 5A), accompanied by significant but
tolerable body weight loss (Figure 5B).

Establishment of a lytic activation-inducible
SNU-719 cell-implanted NOD-SCID
mouse model
An EBVaGC animal model system is indispensable
for in vivo evaluation of gemcitabine-GCV combination
treatment. We therefore developed a mouse model for
this purpose using NOD-SCID. SNU-719 cell-implanted
mice developed measurable tumors in 40–45 days after
implantation. Although Matrigel did not affect cell
viability, Matrigel-based SNU-719 tumors were more
suitable for in vivo experiments than PBS-based inocula
because of improved tumor establishment efficiency and
consistency of tumor size (Supplementary Figure S3A).
Isolated tumors exhibited necrotic regions as reported
previously (Supplementary Figure S3B) [30, 31].
Moreover, tumors kept the phenotypes of SNU-719 cells
and EBV genome, which was verified by flow cytometry

strategies [32]. Three decades ago, virus-targeted
therapies were tried for the treatment of virus-associated
cancers [33]. An anti-viral prodrug, GCV, selectively
phosphorylated by HSV-TK, was suggested for the
treatment of virus-associated cancers [7]. EBV encodes
TK and PK enzymes that each have the capacity to
phosphorylate GCV and are only expressed during lytic
activation. Therefore, chemicals that act as lytic inducers
have been sought to facilitate treatment with GCV.
Epigenetic modifying agents (5-azacytidine, trichostatin
A, sodium butyrate, and valproic acid) and some anticancer drugs (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], cis-platinum, and
taxol) induce lytic activation in EBV-positive cell lines
that originate from various tumors [8, 9, 17, 19, 34, 35].
The effectiveness of these reagents differs among different
cell types. For instance, 5-FU and cis-platinum efficiently
induce lytic activation in EBV-positive epithelial cell
tumors but not in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) or
B cell tumors. These differences make it difficult to
generalize the outcome of EBV-lytic induction treatments,
and therefore only a few clinical trials of these agents have
been performed [36, 37]. Recently, EBV lytic activation
was reported to be induced by the ER or genotoxic
stress response. Moreover, the ATM/p53 pathway that is
activated during the genotoxic stress response directly
influences Zta induction [18, 26]. The different sensitivity
of lytic inducers among cell types may originate from
differences in the underlying molecular mechanisms
during lytic activation.
In this study, we attempted to find new drugs that
induce lytic activation more efficiently in EBVaGCs
and do not affect healthy cells and tissues by screening
JHDL with BZLF1 promoter-transfected AGS cells. This
library consists of drugs that are already used in patients
and approved for safety and toxicity, allowing a bypass
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of phase I/II clinical trials [38, 39]. Gemcitabine was
selected and was confirmed as a lytic inducer by induction
of lytic gene expression and EBV-TK/PK activity in
EBVaGC SNU-719 cells. Moreover, we observed that an
extremely low dose (5 ng/ml) of gemcitabine induced Zta
in SNU-719 cells compared to the dose required in LCLs
or B cell lines (1 μg/ml) [8], which was checked using
our optimized schedule (Supplementary Figure S1C). The
dose discrepancy between EBVaGC-derived cells and B
cell lymphoma-derived cells requires further evaluation
with respect to molecular mechanisms.
Furthermore, gemcitabine-induced lytic activation
was evaluated to determine whether the ER or genotoxic
stress pathway was involved. The ATM inhibitor
KU55933, si-ATM, or si-TP53 treatment induced a
decrease in Zta protein expression. Since the duration of
ATM inhibitor activity is very short, suppression by the
ATM inhibitor was relatively weaker than that of si-ATM.
Most Zta expression was diminished by si-ATM and siTP53. Therefore, the ATM/p53 pathway may be a key
regulator involved in lytic activation by gemcitabine.
For this reason, p53 may be applicable as a biomarker to
determine whether an EBVaGC patient is a candidate for
gemcitabine-GCV combination treatment. TP53 mutation
is frequently observed in gastric cancers of various types,
but is actually rarely observed in EBVaGCs [40, 41].
Moreover, the stability of p53 is also regulated by the
interaction with EBNA1 [42]. Thus, the status of p53 may
determine the responsiveness of gemcitabine-induced lytic
activation, although this notion requires further evaluation.
The final goal of this study was to apply GCV to
EBV-TK/PK-induced EBVaGC cells. The enzymatic
activity of gemcitabine-induced EBV-TK/PK was verified
by showing a positive correlation between gemcitabine
concentration and the accumulation of [125I] FIAU. The
31025

Oncotarget

accumulation of [125I] FIAU in the gemcitabine-untreated
SNU-719 cells may be due to abortive lytic activation as
discussed previously [8]. There are some data supporting
abortive lytic activation in this study. Despite the absence
of gemcitabine, BZLF1 was observed by RT-PCR in SNU719 cells and in mouse-implanted SNU-719 cells. Even
with an extremely low dose of gemcitabine, the survival
of SNU-719 cells was significantly decreased by GCV
treatment, and this is consistent with a previous report [8].
Despite these observations, it remains unclear whether
these observations are a direct read-out of abortive lytic
activation.
We also evaluated the toxicity of gemcitabine and
GCV respectively, and then examined the effects of an
in vitro combination treatment. Gemcitabine exhibited a
narrow safety window in SNU-719 and MKN-74 cells,
but GCV was safe at a relatively high concentration
(100 μg/ml). Synergistic effects of combination treatment
were observed with a range of 0.1–100 ng/ml, as reported
previously [8, 19]. The concentration of gemcitabine was
the most important factor for efficacy of the combination
treatment. In a previous report, the contribution of GCVinduced cytotoxicity may have been underestimated
due to the high dose of gemcitabine (1 μg/ml) [8], as
at this dose, we observed no beneficial outcomes in
combination with GCV. To overcome this problem, we
utilized multiple treatments of low-dose gemcitabine.
Gemcitabine-GCV combination treatment has previously
been reported as a treatment for cancers, albeit via a
completely different mechanism [15]. Gemcitabine was
utilized as a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, which
reduces endogenous dGTP to increase the incorpora­
tion of phosphorylated GCV into DNA. Moreover,
gemcitabine is also known to increase the sensitivity
of bystander cytotoxicity, although the concentration of
gemcitabine needed for such effects (10 μM or 2.6 μg/ml)
is 100 times higher than the concentration used in our
studies.
To date, only a few reports have described mouse
models bearing EBVaGC-originated cell lines due to the
rareness of EBV-naturally infected GC cell lines and the
limited establishment of tumors in immune competent
animals [19, 43] or nude mice [31]. In this study, we
established a lytic activation-inducible EBVaGC mouse
model using NOD-SCID mouse, and furthermore, [125I]
FIAU-based EBV lytic activation monitoring system.
Then, we evaluated a gemcitabine-GCV combination
treatment with this EBVaGC mouse model. In the initial
evaluation, gemcitabine was injected once a week, but
the regression of tumor growth was slow in spite of the
relatively high dose (data not shown). Following the
Ghosh et al. protocol for butyrate [44], we modified
the dosing schedule to consider gemcitabine toxicity and
rapid turnover rate, and observed the efficient induction
of lytic activation with a multiple low dose schedule. As
a result, we identified a combination treatment of 0.5
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mg/kg gemcitabine and 25 mg/kg GCV that suppressed
tumor growth more effectively than gemcitabine alone
without adverse effects. To increase the efficacy of
gemcitabine-GCV combination treatment, we would
consider establishing new EBVaGC model using the
nude mice due to the high sensitivity for drug-induced
apoptosis of NOD-SCID mice. Furthermore, recently,
it was reported that the combination treatment with
gemcitabine, valproic acid, and GCV was efficient in
EBV-positive refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma
patients [25]. Thus, additional combination with valproic
acid could be considered.
In summary, gemcitabine was selected from a screen
of JHDL for its ability to induce EBV lytic activation in
vitro and in vivo in an EBVaGC cell line, SNU-719. ATM/
p53 genotoxic stress is a key regulator of gemcitabineinduced lytic activation. We also developed a lytic
activation-inducible EBVaGC mouse model to evaluate
the efficacy of gemcitabine-GCV combination treatment
in vivo in concert with an imaging system for evaluating
lytic activation. EBV lytic activation-based GCV
combination therapy showed promising results in our
EBVaGC mouse model. To apply these results to EBVaGC
patients, gemcitabine-induced lytic activation must be
generalized using new patient-derived EBVaGC cell lines
and their xenograft-bearing mouse models.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
The SNU-719 and MKN-74 cell lines, which were
obtained from the Korea Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea),
are EBV-positive and EBV-negative gastric carcinoma
cell lines, respectively. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone,
Tauranga, New Zealand) at 37ºC in a humidified CO2
incubator.

Chemical reagents and siRNAs
Gemcitabine (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA),
ganciclovir (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA),
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 20 ng/ml; SigmaAldrich), and ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)
kinase inhibitor (KU55933, 10 μM; Calbiochem, San
Diego, CA, USA) were used. The siRNAs targeting ATM
(NM_000051) and TP53 (NM_000546) were designed
and generated as Supplementary Table S2 (Integrated
DNA Technologies; IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). The
target sequences of the selected siRNAs are as follows:

Induction and inhibition of EBV lytic activation
in SNU-719 cells

GCA CCA CC-3′. GAPDH expression was used as an
internal control. RT (-) PCR was performed to rule out
contamination by EBV genomic DNA.

Cells were treated with the indicated doses of
gemcitabine (0–80 ng/ml) as shown in Figure 1A. Briefly,
Cells were incubated for 24 h, then washed with PBS,
followed by additional culture for 48 h. To suppress
lytic activation, cells were treated with ATM inhibitor
(KU55933) for 1 h after gemcitabine treatment.

[125I] FIAU cellular uptake assay
Cells, which were induced into lytic activation as
described, were incubated with 1 μCi/2 ml [125I] FIAU at
37ºC for 4 h. Then cells were washed and harvested with
200 μl trypsin-EDTA (0.25%, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., Rockford, IL, USA), followed by addition of 400 μl
PBS. The radioactivity was measured using a γ-counter
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The accumulation of
[125I] FIAU was calculated as the percentage of the input
dose added to the medium (%AD) [45].

Western blot analysis
Cells or tumors were lysed with RIPA buffer (50
mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Samples were separated
on a 10% acrylamide gel and transferred to a 0.45 μm
nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Membranes were blocked in TBS containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20 solution and incubated
with primary antibody (Ab). The following antibodies
were used for western blot: anti-Zta (Argene, Verniolle,
France), anti-p53 (Novocastra, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA),
anti-p53 pSer15 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA,
USA), anti-ATM (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-ATM
pSer1981 (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-β-actin
(Sigma-Aldrich)

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was analyzed using the Cell Counting
Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Lab, Kumamoto, Japan). SNU-719
(3 × 103 cells/100 μl) and MKN-74 (2 × 103 cells/100 μl)
cells were plated in 96-well plates and incubated at 37ºC in
5% CO2 overnight. Then, the cells were treated as described
in Figure 2D. Then, 10 μl CCK-8 solut­ion (2-[2-methoxy4-nitrophenyl]-3-[4-nitrophenyl]-5-[2, 4-disulfophenyl]2H-tetrazolium) was added to each well. The plates were
incubated at 37ºC for 3 h, and the absorbance at 450 nm
was measured using a microplate reader (Perkin Elmer,
Waltham, MA, USA).

Immunofluorescence assay
Cells were fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 minute and blocked with 10% normal donkey serum
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) for
1 h at room temperature. Cells were stained with anti-Zta
or anti-gp350 Ab (gift from Prof. Song) and Rhodamine
Red-X-AffiniPure donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson
ImmunoResearch). and then visualized by LSM 700
confocal microscopy (Cal Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
In addition, 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) staining was also
performed to visualize cell nuclei.

Generating EBV-positive or -negative GC cell
line-implanted mice
All mice were maintained under specific pathogenfree conditions, and the experiments involving animals
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees (IACUC) at Yonsei University College of
Medicine (2012-0263). Six to seven-week-old female
NOD-SCID mice (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience
and Biotechnology, Daejeon, Korea) were used for all
experiments. SNU-719 or MKN-74 cells were suspended
in a 200 μl solution containing 100 μl Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and 100 μl PBS
and then injected subcutaneously into the right or left flank
of mice. Tumor size was measured approximately every
third day with calipers, and tumor volume was calculated
as l × w2 (l: long axis, w: width) [15]. Approximately 6
or 4 weeks after implantation of SNU-719 or MKN-74
cells, respectively, mice carrying tumors that reached
a volume of approximately 1,000 mm3 , were used for
in vivo experiments and imaging.

RT-PCR
RNA was isolated from cell pellets or tumor
tissues using the RNeasy Mini kit and RNase-free
DNase (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA was synthesized
using 5 μg total RNA, SuperScript III reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) and random hexamers. PCR was performed
to evaluate EBV lytic gene expression using the specific
primers: BZLF1, 5′-ACC AAG CCG GGG GAG AAG
CA-3′ and 5′-CCA GGC TTG GGC ACA TCT GC-3′;
BGLF4, 5′-CGC TCG GCT ACT CGC TGC TC-3′ and
5′-CGG AGG AAG CGG GCA AAC GT-3′; BXLF1, 5′TTA CCC TGC CCA GGG GAG CC-3′ and 5′-GTC ATC
GAG CCC AAG GCC GG-3′; GAPDH, 5′-GAT GGC
ATG GAC TGT GGT CA-3′ and 5′-GCA ATG CCT CCT

Molecular imaging of in vivo lytic activation
When the tumor size reached approximately 1,000
mm3, 200 μCi [125I] FIAU was administered to each tumorcarrying mouse through the tail vein. The mice were
31027

Oncotarget

imaged by [125I] FIAU-based SPECT planar imaging as
previously described [45]. Briefly, the mice were placed in
a posterior position on a warm-bed and anesthetized with
2% isoflurane (Choongwae, Seoul, Korea) before injection
of [125I] FIAU and 1.5% isoflurane during imaging. For
thyroid-blocked images, 1 mg sodium perchlorate (SigmaAldrich) was injected intraperitoneally into the mice
before injection of [125I] FIAU.
