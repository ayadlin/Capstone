Abstract
Identification and reversal of treatment resistance mechanisms of clinically refractory tumor cells is
critical for successful cancer therapy. Here we show that ATP-binding cassette member B5 (ABCB5) identifies
therapy-refractory tumor cells in colorectal cancer patients following fluorouracil (5-FU)–based chemoradiation therapy and provide evidence for a functional role of ABCB5 in colorectal cancer 5-FU resistance.
Examination of human colon and colorectal cancer specimens revealed ABCB5 to be expressed only on rare
cells within healthy intestinal tissue, whereas clinical colorectal cancers exhibited substantially increased
levels of ABCB5 expression. Analysis of successive, patient-matched biopsy specimens obtained prior to
and following neoadjuvant 5-FU–based chemoradiation therapy in a series of colorectal cancer patients
revealed markedly enhanced abundance of ABCB5-positive tumor cells when residual disease was detected.
Consistent with this finding, the ABCB5-expressing tumor cell population was also treatment refractory and
exhibited resistance to 5-FU–induced apoptosis in a colorectal cancer xenograft model of 5-FU monotherapy.
Mechanistically, short hairpin RNA–mediated ABCB5 knockdown significantly inhibited tumorigenic xenograft growth and sensitized colorectal cancer cells to 5-FU–induced cell killing. Our results identify ABCB5
as a novel molecular marker of therapy-refractory tumor cells in colorectal cancer patients and point to a
need for consistent eradication of ABCB5-positive resistant tumor cell populations for more effective
colorectal cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5307–16. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related
mortality. It arises from the accumulation of genetic mutations in normal epithelium, leading to the development of
adenomas with eventual neoplastic transformation into
invasive, metastatic carcinomas (1). Despite significant progress in early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer, a
high proportion of patients with surgically resectable tumors

eventually succumb to metastatic disease originating from
residual microscopic malignancy, not evident at the time
of surgery (1, 2). Adjuvant therapeutic modalities such as
radiotherapy and chemotherapy are designed to target residual tumor cells; however, their success is currently limited
by the existence of therapy-resistant cancer cell populations
(2–4).
Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the main chemotherapeutic
agents for colorectal cancer. In patients with advanced colorectal cancer, treatment with 5-FU reduces tumor size by
approximately 50 % and prolongs median survival by 5 months
(5). Identification and targeting of 5-FU–resistant populations
might, therefore, be expected to lead to further improvements
in advanced colorectal cancer survival.
Recent studies have revealed heterogeneity of human
colorectal cancers with regard to molecular markers that
identify highly tumorigenic and potentially therapy-resistant
cancer subpopulations, including CD133, ESAhighCD44þ,
CD166, ALDH1, and WNT (6–10). For example, in vitro
treatment of human HT-29 colorectal cancer cells with high
doses of 5-FU resulted in significant enrichment of CD133þ
colorectal cancer subpopulations (11) and CD133þ colorectal cancer cells can be sensitized to 5-FU- or oxaliplatinmediated cell killing by using an anti–IL-4 neutralizing
antibody (12) or specific gene silencing of the aurora-A
kinase (13). In addition, CD133-overexpressing tumors were

found to be more resistant to 5-FU–based chemotherapy
and CD133 expression was associated with poor prognosis in
a recent study of 501 cases of human colorectal cancer (14).
Although additional studies are required to further delineate
whether all heterogeneously expressed colorectal cancer
markers (6–10, 15) identify hierarchical tumor organization,
as posited by the cancer stem cell model (16), and while
more work is necessary to define their specific relationships,
the data to date suggest preferential survival of CD133þ
colorectal cancer cells following chemotherapy and underline the importance of identifying and, ultimately, targeting
all possible resistance mechanisms of these aggressive
tumor subpopulations (2, 3).
We have recently cloned and characterized ABCB5 [ATPbinding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 5; refs.
17–22], a chemoresistance gene in human melanomas (18, 23,
24) and hepatocellular carcinomas (25) preferentially
expressed on CD133þ tumor cells (18, 25), which correlates
with clinical tumor progression in these malignancies according to results from several laboratories (19, 25–27) and serves
as a major independent biomarker of tumor recurrence and
poor survival in human hepatocellular carcinoma patients
(25). Our previous analysis of mRNA expression across diverse
physiologic and malignant human tissues showed that ABCB5
is also expressed in human colorectal cancer (18). Therefore,
we hypothesized that ABCB5 might identify therapy-refractory tumor populations in patients with colorectal cancer and
that ABCB5, similar to its role in melanoma (23), might
contribute to 5-FU resistance in this malignancy. Our results
identify ABCB5 overexpression in clinical colorectal cancers
compared with healthy controls and show that ABCB5 marks
therapy-refractory tumor subpopulations following neoadjuvant 5-FU–based chemoradiation treatment in colorectal
cancer patients. Mechanistically, utilization of a colorectal
cancer xenotransplantation model reveals resistance of
ABCB5þ tumor subpopulations to 5-FU–induced apoptosis.
Moreover, stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated ABCB5
knockdown in human colorectal cancer cells enhances 5-FU–
mediated cell killing.

Materials and Methods
Clinical colorectal cancer specimens
Clinical colorectal tumor specimens were obtained from
patients according to human subjects research protocols
approved by institutional IRBs at the VA Boston Healthcare
System and the University of W€
urzburg Medical School.
Baseline ABCB5 expression was examined in tumors of
diverse stages resected from 15 patients not subjected to
preoperative treatment (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, patient-matched biopsy specimens derived from 7
rectal cancer patients prior to and following neoadjuvant
treatment with chemoradiation (bolus 5-FU treatment and
long-course 40–52 Gy total dose radiotherapy) and subsequent curative surgical resection were included in the study
(Supplementary Table S2) for analysis of ABCB5 expression
in pretreatment tumor biopsies and posttreatment surgically resected tumors.

Colorectal cancer cells and culture methods
Authenticated human colorectal cancer cell lines (HT-29
and SW480) were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection and were cultured and passaged for fewer than
6 months in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza Bio-Whittaker)
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Invitrogen GIBCO) and
1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza Bio-Whittaker).
COLO205, HCT-116, HCT-15, HT-29, HCC-2998, KM12, and
SW620 mRNA specimens were provided by the NCI/NIH
Developmental Therapeutics Program.
Antibodies
The anti-ABCB5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3C2-1D12
(17–19), commercially available from AbD Serotec, was used
for flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analyses.
Unconjugated MOPC-31C mouse isotype control mAb was
purchased from BD Pharmingen and APC-conjugated secondary Ab from eBioscience. For Western blots, the following
polyclonal Abs (pAbs) were used: rabbit anti-human ABCB5
(Abgent), rabbit anti-human a-Tubulin (Abcam), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG
(Jackson Immunoresearch). The following Abs were used for
immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence staining: Rabbit anti-CD133 (Abcam), alkaline phosphatase horse antimouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase goat anti-rabbit
IgG, Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor
488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen).
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
For single-label immunohistochemistry, 5-mm sections
were deparaffinized in xylene 2  10 minutes, followed with
2  100% ethanol, 95% and 75% ethanol, 3  dH2O, 2 minutes
for each. Subsequently, sections were placed in 1 target
retrieval solution (Dako) and boiled in a Pascal pressure
chamber (Dako) at 125 C for 30 seconds, 90 C for 10 seconds
and were then allowed to cool to room temperature. Immunohistochemistry was done as described previously (19, 22).
Briefly, the sections were incubated with primary Ab at 4 C
overnight. After washing out unbound primary Ab with TBS0.05% tween 20 (TBST), the tissue sections were incubated
with peroxidase-conjugated or alkaline phosphatase (AP)conjugated secondary Ab at room temperature for 30 minutes,
then washed with TBST 3  5 minutes. Immunoreactivity was
detected by using NovaRED peroxidase substrate or AP red
substrate (Vector Laboratories). For double-label immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized and heat-induced
antigen retrieval with Target Retrieval Solution (Dako) was
used. Sections were incubated with ABCB5 mAb and CD133
mAb at 4 C overnight and then with peroxidase-conjugated
horse anti-rabbit Ab (Vector) and AP-conjugated horse antimouse Ab at room temperature for 30 minutes. CD133 staining was detected with NovaRED peroxidase substrate and
ABCB5 staining was detected with AP red substrate (Vector
Laboratories). For double-label immunofluorescence, sections
were deparaffinized and heat-induced antigen retrieval with
Target Retrieval Solution (Dako) was used. Slides were
blocked for 30 minutes with serum, incubated with ABCB5
mAb and CD133 mAb at 4 C overnight and then incubated

with the appropriate secondary Abs in the dark for 1 hour.
After washing out secondary Ab, slides were then coverslipped
with ProLong Gold Anti-Fade with DAPI (40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole; Invitrogen). Sections were analyzed with a
BX51/BX52 microscope (Olympus America Inc.). Images
were captured by using the CytoVision 3.6 software (Applied
Imaging). For quantitative analysis of ABCB5 expression,
ImageJ software (http:/rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), which calculates
percentage pixel area, coupled with the Color Deconvolution
plug-in (http://www.dentistry.bham.ac.uk/landinig/software/
cdeconv/cdeconv.html), was used to quantify the percentage
of tissue that showed immunoreactivity for ABCB5 in microscopically acquired JPEG images of normal colon, clinical
colorectal cancers, and 5-FU–treated cancer xenografts. Measurements of ABCB5 expression in normal colon were done in
clinically and histologically uninvolved portions of surgical
specimens of the same group of colorectal cancer patients
(Supplementary Table S1). ABCB5 staining intensity in full
thickness colonic wall specimens was hereby evaluated in
histologically selected areas representing only colonic epithelium to avoid inclusion of nonepithelial stromal, submucosa
and muscular elements. In each case, ImageJ analysis software
was used to quantify the pixel intensity of the selected areas
as described previously (28).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling/ABCB5 costaining
The ApopTag TdT Enzyme Kit (Chemicon International)
was used for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. After
deparaffinization and antigen retrieval, the colorectal cancer
sections were incubated with TdT enzyme mixture with
77 mL ApopTag reaction buffer þ 33 mL ApopTag TdT
Enzyme (33 mL dH2O instead of TdT enzyme was used as a
negative control) at 37 C for 1 hour and then washed with
dH2O and PBS once for each assay. The sections were
incubated with ABCB5 mAb at 4 C overnight and then with
peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-DIG Ab (Roche) and
AP-conjugated horse anti-mouse Ab at room temperature
for 30 minutes. TUNEL staining was detected with NovaRED
peroxidase substrate (Vector) and ABCB5 staining was
detected with AP NBT/BCIP.
Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested by using Versene (Invitrogen) as
described (17, 18) and dissociated HT-29 and SW480 cell
cultures were passed through a 40-mm nylon mesh to exclude
cell aggregates followed by trypan blue examination for cell
viability, as described previously (29, 30). Single cell suspensions used for flow cytometry consistently showed more than
99% cell viability (trypan blue exclusion) and absence of cell
detritus or cell clusters. Analysis of ABCB5 expression in HT29 and SW480 colon cancer cells was done by single-color flow
cytometry as described previously (18, 19). Briefly, 1  106 cells
were incubated for 30 minutes at 4 C with APC-conjugated
anti-ABCB5 mAb or APC-conjugated isotype control mAb
(10 mg/mL), and single-color flow cytometry was subsequently
carried out on ungated cells with acquisition of fluorescence

emission at the FL4 (APC) spectrum on a Becton Dickinson
FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The positive gates were set at a
detection threshold of 0.1% of cells in control mAb-stained
samples.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was prepared from all 7 of the NCI-60 colorectal
cancer cell cultures maintained at the National Cancer Institute and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(qRT-PCR) was done as described previously (18). The primers
for ABCB5 [Homo sapiens ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B
(MDR/TAP), member 5 (ABCB5), transcript variant 2, mRNA
NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_178559.5] detection were 50 CACAAAAGGCCATTCAGGCT-30 (forward) and 50 -GCTGAGGAATCCACCCAATCT-30 (reverse) and the primers for b-actin
were 50 -CCTGGCACCCAGCACAAT-30 and 50 -GCCGATCCACACGGAGTACT-30 (18). Relative gene expression was measured with the GeneAmp 7000 Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems) and ABCB5 expression was assessed by
the ratio of the expression level in the sample against mean
expression in all samples as described previously (18).
Full ABCB5 mRNA open reading frame identification in
HT-29 and SW480 colorectal cancer cells
RNA was prepared by using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and
reverse-transcribed by using the Advantage RT-for-PCR Kit
(Clontech) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
cDNA was then subjected to PCR amplification of the full
ABCB5 open reading frame (ORF; transcript variant 2, mRNA
NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_178559.5) as previously
described for human melanocytes (17). For sequencing reactions, the PCR product was then used as a template for nested
PCR of 3 overlapping fragments encompassing the ORF.
N-terminal: Forward (ATGGTGGATGAGAATGACATCAGAGCTTT), reverse (GAATTAAATAGGCTCCAAATCGAAACCCT);
Middle: Forward (AATGACTGGATTTGCCAACAAAGATAAGC), reverse (TTCTCAGGGAGACCTTCAATAAAAGAATG);
C-terminal: Forward (AAATAG CAATCGTTCCTCAAGAGCCTGTG), reverse (TCACTGCACTGACTGTGCATTCACTAACT).
The full ORF sequences of ABCB5 (transcript variant 2,
mRNA NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_178559.5) expressed by
the human HT-29 and SW480 colorectal cancer cell lines were
submitted to the GenBank database under the following
accession numbers: GU437216 for HT-29, and GU437217 for
SW480.
Animals
Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice
(NOD/SCID) and NOD/SCID interleukin-2 (IL-2) Rg / mice
were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The human
colorectal cancer to NOD/SCID mouse xenotransplantation
model was used to dissect colorectal cancer drug resistance,
because it represents an established model system (6, 7).
NOD/SCID IL-2Rg / (NSG) mice, which have a higher tumor
take for some cancers because of more profound host immune
suppression (22), were selected as the model of choice to
assess intrinsic molecular function of ABCB5, independent of
potential tumor microenvironmental interactions (22). Mice

were maintained in accordance with the institutional guidelines of Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical
School and experiments were done according to approved
experimental protocols.

Tris pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). A tubulin Western blot was used as a control for lysate
concentrations.

Human colorectal cancer xenotransplantation and 5-FU
treatment
HT-29 or SW480 human colorectal cancer cells (1  106
each) were injected s.c. into the right flanks of recipient NOD/
SCID mice. Tumor formation was assayed weekly and tumor
volumes were calculated as described previously (19). At
5 weeks (HT-29) or 9 weeks (SW480) posttumor cell inoculation, mice were randomized into 5-FU (Teva) or vehicle
control treatment groups with similar tumor volumes. 5-FU
was administered by daily intraperitoneal injection for 5
consecutive days, as described (31, 32), at 50 mg/kg body
weight, and control animals were given PBS at equal volumes.
Tumor xenografts were harvested 1 day following administration of the final treatment dose, and frozen or paraffinembedded colon cancer sections were prepared for subsequent immunohistochemical analysis. In additional experiments, HT-29 or SW480 human colorectal cancer cells, or their
corresponding stable ABCB5 shRNA knockdown or vector
control variants (1  106 cells/mouse, respectively) were
injected s.c. into the right flanks of recipient NOD/SCID IL2Rg / mice. Tumorigenic growth of untreated HT-29 or
SW480 human colorectal cancer cells or their corresponding
stable ABCB5 shRNA knockdown or vector control variants
were assayed weekly as a time course, at least up to the
endpoint of 7 weeks, unless excessive tumor size or disease
state required protocol-stipulated euthanasia earlier, by determination of tumor volume as described previously (19).

MTT cell growth and cytotoxicity assays
In vitro growth kinetics of HT-29 or SW480 human colorectal cancer cells or their corresponding stable ABCB5 shRNA
knockdown or vector control variants were assayed by using
the MTT cell proliferation assay as described previously (18).
To determine the effect of ABCB5 gene knockdown on 5-FU–
induced cell killing, cells were seeded in 96-well dishes and
exposed to a range of 5-FU concentrations (0.5–100 nmol/L)
and the dose response of cell viability was measured after
7 days of drug treatment by using a TACS MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Trevigen) according to the manufacturer's
protocol, as previously described for doxorubicin in human
melanoma cells (18).

Generation of stable ABCB5 knockdown colorectal
cancer cell variants
Generation of stable HT-29-pSUPER-Retro-Puro-ABCB5,
SW480-pSUPER-Retro-Puro-ABCB5, or their respective empty
vector cell variants was accomplished by transfection of plasmids with FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent followed by puromycin selection (1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL, respectively). The
ABCB5 shRNA target sequence GCTGGAAAGATAGCAACTGAA was as previously described (24). Knockdown was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification by using ABCB5-specific
primers and 35 cycles of amplification and comparison relative
to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) RTPCR amplification from the corresponding samples, with 28
cycles of amplification. The primers were as follows: ABCB5:
Forward (GCGAGCAAAGGTCGGACTACAATCGTGG), reverse
(CCCAGAACCACAAAAGGCCATTCAGGC); GAPDH: Forward
(ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC), reverse (TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA). Confirmation of ABCB5 knockdown at the protein level was done by utilizing an immunoprecipitation (IP)Western blot by using a rabbit anti-ABCB5 pAb. Briefly, 1 mg
(HT-29) or 4 mg (SW480) total cell lysate and their respective
knockdown lysates were sonicated and precleared before
incubation with 2 mg ABCB5 Ab with protein G agarose for
3 hours at 4 C. IPs were then washed 4 before SDS-PAGE and
Western blot. The buffer used for lysis and IP was 50 mmol/L

Statistical analysis
Statistical differences between expression levels of markers,
between surviving cell fractions, or between tumor volumes
were determined by using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney
test, with 2-sided P values of P < 0.05 considered significant.
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for assessment of ABCB5 expression–drug potency relationships. The
dual criteria of P < 0.05 and r > 0.3 were used to identify
significant negative correlations as described previously (18).

Results
ABCB5 is expressed only on rare cells in healthy colonic
mucosa but markedly increased in human colorectal
cancer
In healthy human colon, we found ABCB5 to be expressed
only on rare, distinct cells residing preferentially at or near the
base of colonic crypts (Fig. 1A), which also contain CD133positive cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, ABCB5-positive crypt
cells coexpressed CD133, a candidate marker of intestinal
stem cells (33, 34) and this cell population represented a
subset of the CD133-expressing component (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, ABCB5 and CD133 were expressed on opposite poles
of individual cells, in keeping with the phenomenon of apicobasal polarity attributed to normal columnar epithelial
cells (35). In clinical human colorectal cancer specimens,
ABCB5 could also be detected to coexpress CD133, a marker
of 5-FU–resistant tumor populations in colorectal cancer
(14, 36) and a candidate marker of more aggressive colorectal
cancer cells according to some reports (7, 8), in the same
tumor regions and on the same cancer cells (Fig. 1C). Intriguingly, ABCB5 was expressed at higher levels in lesser differentiated areas of human colorectal cancer specimens
compared with better differentiated areas (Fig. 1D, left panels),
based on conventional histopathologic evaluation of the
correlative architecture and cytology of individual patient
samples (37), similar to previous observations in malignant
melanoma in which ABCB5 expression was found to correlate
with more advanced stages of disease (19, 26). Aggregate

A Therapy-Refractory Tumor Population in Colorectal Cancer

quantitative analysis of all tissue specimens examined (Supplementary Table S1) showed marked ABCB5 overexpression
in colorectal cancer specimens compared with normal colonic
mucosa (ABCB5 positivity 15.39%  4.06% vs. 0.66%  0.24%
of cells, respectively; mean  SEM, P ¼ 0.0016; Fig. 1D, right
panel). These results provide initial evidence that the chemoresistance mediator ABCB5 is overexpressed in human
colorectal cancer.
ABCB5þ colorectal cancer cells exhibit increased
resistance to 5-FU therapy
On the basis of previously shown functions of ABCB5 as a
chemoresistance mediator in human melanoma (18, 23, 24)
and hepatocellular carcinoma (25), and on the here-identified
preferential coexpression of ABCB5 with CD133, a marker of 5FU–resistant tumor populations in colorectal cancer (14, 36),
we investigated ABCB5 expression prior to and following
standard 5-FU–based neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy
in a series of human rectal cancer patients (Supplementary
Table S2). Analysis of matched diagnostic rectal cancer biopsy
specimens in a series of patients who underwent neoadjuvant
treatment prior to curative surgical tumor resection revealed
ABCB5 positivity in only 5.7%  4.6% of rectal cancer cells

(mean  SEM) in pretreatment specimens (Fig. 2A and B),
whereas posttreatment specimens showed markedly
increased levels of ABCB5 expression (P < 0.01), with 32.3%
 8.8% of cancer cells staining positively for ABCB5
(Fig. 2A and B). Posttreatment rectal cancer specimens also
revealed preferential coexpression of ABCB5 with CD133, in
the same tumor regions and on the same cancer cells (Fig. 2C).
These findings show that ABCB5þ rectal cancer cells are
more resistant to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy involving 5-FU.
To further dissect a potential role of ABCB5 in colorectal
cancer 5-FU resistance, we examined ABCB5 expression and
5-FU treatment response of ABCB5þ cancer cell populations
in an established in vivo model system utilizing NOD/SCID
murine recipients of human colorectal cancer xenografts
(6, 7). First, we found that ABCB5 expression levels correlated
significantly with colorectal cancer resistance to 5-FU (Pearson correlation r ¼ 0.531, P ¼ 0.019; Fig. 3A) when ABCB5
mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR analyses in
7 colorectal cancer lines from the NCI-60 panel used by the
National Cancer Institute for drug screening and compared
with the respective 5-FU GI50 values available from the
NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program (18). SW480 and

HT-29 cells were selected for further study on the basis of
their well-characterized in vivo tumorigenic potential and
were found to express the principal ABCB5 mRNA isoform
first identified in human malignant melanoma (ref. 17; NCBI
Reference Sequence: NP_848654.3), as determined by RT-PCR
amplification, cloning, and sequencing of the corresponding
complete 2,784-bp cDNA ORF (deposited to the GenBank
database under accession numbers GU437217 and
GU437216, respectively; Fig. 3B, left panel). ABCB5 protein
expression by SW480 and HT-29 cells was shown by flow
cytometry (Fig. 3B, right panels) and IP and Western blotting
(Fig. 4A), with 20.1% of SW480 and 4.9% of HT-29 colorectal
cancer cells found to express ABCB5 (Fig. 3B, right panels). In
vivo, quantitative immunohistochemical expression analyses

specimens derived from 5-FU–treated xenograft recipients
revealed enhanced resistance to 5-FU–induced apoptotic cell
killing of ABCB5þ cells (predominantly TUNEL-negative)
compared with ABCB5 cells (predominantly TUNEL positive) following systemic 5-FU therapy (Fig. 3C). In aggregate,
these results reveal increased therapeutic resistance of
ABCB5þ colorectal cancer cells, compared with ABCB5
tumor populations, to 5-FU treatment.
ABCB5 mediates 5-FU resistance in human colorectal
cancer cells
The findings of increased resistance of ABCB5þ colorectal
cancer cells to 5-FU therapy suggested that ABCB5 might
functionally contribute to 5-FU resistance in this malignancy,
similar to the role of a related ABCB5 isoform (NCBI Reference
Sequence: NM_001163942.1) in human melanoma (23). To
explore the potential role of ABCB5 as a 5-FU resistance
mediator in colorectal cancer, we generated stable ABCB5
shRNA knockdown (ABCB5-KD) or pSUPER vector control
variants for both SW480 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells.
Significant ABCB5 knockdown was shown for both HT-29 and
SW480 cells (Fig. 4A) at both the mRNA level by using RT-PCR

and real-time PCR (HT-29: 64% knockdown and SW480: 65%
knockdown) and at the protein level by using IP-Western blot
analysis (Fig. 4A). First, in vitro and in vivo growth characterization of ABCB5 knockdown variants versus controls
revealed that in vitro proliferation was not significantly different for HT-29ABCB5-KD versus HT-29control or SW480ABCB5-KD
versus SW480control cells (Fig. 4B), even upon long-term, 3week in vitro culture (culture doubling time HT-29ABCB5-KD vs.
HT-29control: 18.7  1.8 hours vs. 17.9  1.4 hours, mean  SD,
NS; culture doubling time SW480ABCB5-KD vs. SW480control: 17.9
 0.8 hours vs. 18.0  0.2 hours, mean  SD, NS). In contrast,
in vivo tumorigenic growth resulting from xenotransplantation of HT-29ABCB5-KD or SW480ABCB5-KD cells was significantly
inhibited compared with that resulting from xenotransplantation of HT-29control or SW480control cells, respectively (HT29ABCB5-KD vs. HT-29control at 7 weeks: 336  52 mm3 vs. 1,150
 269 mm3, 71% inhibition, P ¼ 0.0163; SW480ABCB5-KD vs.
SW480control at 5 weeks: 429  23 mm3 vs. 983  108 mm3,
66% inhibition, P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 4C), pointing to a functional role
of ABCB5 in tumorigenic growth. Next, on the basis of
identical growth characteristics of untreated control and
ABCB5-KD colorectal cancer cells in vitro, we subjected
ABCB5-KD or control cells to 5-FU–induced cell killing as a
dose response to increasing 5-FU concentrations in 1-week
drug exposure assays, followed by cell viability measurements
to assess relative cell death, using an MTT assay (18). ABCB5
knockdown significantly reversed the 5-FU resistance of both
HT-29 and SW480 colorectal cancer cells (Fig. 4D), resulting in
significant enhancement of cell killing at 5-FU concentrations
as low as 0.5 nmol/L in HT-29 cells, and at all 5-FU concentrations greater than 5 nmol/L in both HT-29 and SW480 cells,
with significant reductions of the LD50 for both HT-29ABCB5-KD
vs. HT-29control cells (LD50 2.6 nmol/L vs. 12 nmol/L, respec-

tively, 4.6-fold sensitization, P < 0.0001) and SW480ABCB5-KD
vs. SW480control cells (LD50 2.6 nmol/L vs. 22 nmol/L, respectively, 8.5-fold sensitization, P < 0.0001). These results show
that ABCB5 mediates 5-FU resistance in human colorectal
cancer cells.

Discussion
In this study, on the basis of our previous identification of
ABCB5 mRNA expression in human colorectal cancer (18), we
carried out an in-depth analysis of ABCB5 expression and
function involving healthy human colon specimens from 9
distinct individuals, colorectal cancer specimens from 23
patients, and 8 established colorectal cancer cell lines.
First, we found ABCB5 expression to be restricted to rare
cells within the healthy human colon but detected marked
overexpression in human colorectal cancer. These results
identify ABCB5 expression in clinical human colorectal cancer
and parallel findings in melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma of absent or rare ABCB5 expression in the respective
nonmalignant tissues, but overexpression in the corresponding
malignancies (19, 25–27). Intriguingly, we found ABCB5 to be
coexpressed with CD133 on the same individual cells in healthy
colon and in human colorectal cancer, also resembling previous findings of coexpression of these molecular markers in
human skin and malignant melanoma (17–19) and hepatocellular carcinoma (25). Because CD133 represents a candidate
intestinal stem cell marker (34) and potential marker of colorectal cancer stem cells (7, 8), and because colorectal cancers
can originate from physiologic intestinal stem cells (34, 38)
including CD133þ colonic crypt populations (34), ABCB5 might
provide a novel molecular link between the physiologic colonic
stem cell niche and the cell-of-origin for colon cancer.

ABCB5 protein expression analysis in colon cancer xenografts (% positive cells, mean  SEM) dissected from vehicle control (n ¼ 13) versus 5-FU–treated

Second, our results reveal that ABCB5þ malignant subpopulations are resistant to 5-FU–based chemoradiation therapy
in rectal cancer patients, thereby establishing ABCB5 as a
novel molecular marker of clinically therapy-refractory colorectal cancer cells. The preferential coexpression of CD133 by
5-FU–resistant ABCB5þ cancer cells is consistent with previous findings that documented increased CD133 expression
among 5-FU–resistant colorectal cancer cell subsets in vitro
(11), and clinical findings of increased resistance of CD133þ
colorectal tumors to 5-FU–based chemotherapy in human
patients (14). In addition, our results show that ABCB5þ
malignant subpopulations are also resistant to clinical radiation therapy. Importantly, although a functional role in cancer
therapeutic resistance has not been attributed to date to
CD133, ABCB5 isoforms have been shown to confer resistance

5314

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

to multiple chemotherapeutic agents in malignant melanoma
and hepatocellular carcinoma (18, 23–25). Our findings therefore establish a novel link between biomarkers of therapeutic
resistance and a molecular drug resistance mechanism in
clinical colorectal cancer.
Finally, the observed expression of the drug resistance
mediator ABCB5 by 5-FU–refractory colorectal cancer cell
populations suggested a potential functional role of ABCB5
as a mediator of 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer. Emergence of 5-FU resistance is a major impediment to successful
colorectal cancer therapy, but the various potential mechanisms of 5-FU resistance in this malignancy, particularly of more
aggressive and resistant CD133þ cancer subpopulations that
correlate with recurrence and poor prognosis (14, 36, 39), have
not been fully explored. Our results provide initial evidence for

a functional contribution of ABCB5 to 5-FU resistance in
human colorectal cancer, because stable shRNA-mediated
ABCB5 knockdown significantly sensitized human colorectal
cancer cells to 5-FU–induced cell killing. Thus, therapy-refractory colorectal cancer cells that might cause tumor recurrence
possess a protective mechanism, ABCB5, potentially intrinsic
to CD133þ populations from which the tumor arises (7, 8, 34).
This function parallels the roles of additional ABC transporters
in cancer drug resistance, including of ABCB1 and ABCG2,
which afford protection to normal stem cells and cancer cell
subsets in the corresponding malignancies in other tissues (40).
Our results therefore suggest a novel molecular link between
clinical drug resistance and potential tumor-initiating cells in
human colorectal cancer.
In aggregate, our results identify ABCB5 as a novel molecular marker of therapy-refractory tumor cell population in
colorectal cancer patients and point to a need for consistent
eradication of ABCB5-positive resistant tumor cell populations for more effective colorectal cancer therapy. ABCB5targeted resistance reversal or ABCB5-positive cancer cell

ablation might therefore represent novel, clinically relevant
strategies to ultimately enhance tumor eradication in colorectal cancer patients, to produce more durable clinical
responses than those obtained by therapeutic strategies
directed predominantly at the bulk population of tumor
cells.
