Abstract

Introduction

Lapatinib is active at the ATP-binding site of tyrosine kinases
that are associated with the human epidermal growth factor
receptor (Her-1 or ErbB1) and Her-2. It is conceivable that
lapatinib may inhibit the function of ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters by binding to their ATP-binding sites. The
aim of this study was to investigate the ability of lapatinib
to reverse tumor multidrug resistance (MDR) due to overexpression of ABC subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and ABC
subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) transporters. Our results
showed that lapatinib significantly enhanced the sensitivity to
ABCB1 or ABCG2 substrates in cells expressing these transporters, although a small synergetic effect was observed in
combining lapatinib and conventional chemotherapeutic
agents in parental sensitive MCF-7 or S1 cells. Lapatinib
alone, however, did not significantly alter the sensitivity of
non-ABCB1 or non-ABCG2 substrates in sensitive and resistant cells. Additionally, lapatinib significantly increased the
accumulation of doxorubicin or mitoxantrone in ABCB1- or
ABCG2-overexpressing cells and inhibited the transport of
methotrexate and E217BG by ABCG2. Furthermore, lapatinib
stimulated the ATPase activity of both ABCB1 and ABCG2
and inhibited the photolabeling of ABCB1 or ABCG2 with
[125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin in a concentration-dependent
manner. However, lapatinib did not affect the expression of
these transporters at mRNA or protein levels. Importantly,
lapatinib also strongly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel on the
inhibition of growth of the ABCB1-overexpressing KBv200 cell
xenografts in nude mice. Overall, we conclude that lapatinib
reverses ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR by directly
inhibiting their transport function. These findings may be
useful for cancer combinational therapy with lapatinib in the
clinic. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7905–14]

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to successful
chemotherapy treatment. MDR often results due to overexpression
of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. In the human genome,
48 different ABC transporters have been identified and are divided
into seven subfamilies (A-G) based on sequence similarities (1).
Thus far, the major members of the ABC transporters leading to
MDR in cancer cells include ABC subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1;
also called P-glycoprotein), ABC subfamily C members (ABCCs,
MDR-associated proteins), and ABC subfamily G member 2
(ABCG2; also called breast cancer resistance protein, mitoxantrone
resistance protein, and placenta-specific ABC transporter). These
membrane proteins actively pump out a wide range of structurally
and functionally diverse amphipathic anticancer drugs from the
inside of tumor cells, thereby decreasing their intracellular drug
accumulation and resulting in chemotherapeutic drug resistance
(1–4). Furthermore, each transporter can translocate unique
compounds in addition to some overlapping substrates (1). Drugs
transported by ABCB1 include hydrophobic compounds, either
uncharged or slightly positively charged, including most chemotherapeutic agents such as Vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines,
epipodophyllotoxins, and taxanes (5). A few of the ABCC subfamily
members have been shown to confer MDR to organic anion
compounds and phase II metabolic products, as well as some
natural product chemotherapeutic agents, antifolates, and nucleotide analogues (6). The spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents
transported by ABCG2 includes anthracyclines, mitoxantrone,
camptothecin-derived and indolocarbazole topoisomerase I inhibitors, methotrexate, and flavopiridol (7).
The ErbB/Her family of receptor tyrosine kinases mediates
the transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic
domain of tyrosine kinase receptors via homodimerization or
heterodimerization on ligand activation (8). In human tumors,
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; Her-1 or ErbB1) and
the other three members of the EGFR family, human epidermal
receptor type 2, 3, and 4 (Her-2, Her-3, and Her-4), are often
overexpressed, dysregulated, or mutated, and these abnormal
alterations of EGFR activate a series of intracellular protein kinase
signaling pathways, such as the Ras/mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, signal transducer
and activator of transcription, protein kinase C, and phospholipase
D pathways, promoting tumor growth and progression including
the promotion of proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis,
and inhibition of apoptosis (8, 9). Therefore, blockade of EGFR and/
or Her-2 activation may be able to suppress cancer cell growth and

progression. Lapatinib (Tykerb, GW572016) is an orally active small
molecule, which is a novel member of the family of kinase inhibitors
that inhibits the tyrosine kinases of Her-2 and EGFR. In preclinical
studies, lapatinib was not cross-resistant to trastuzumab (10, 11). In
clinical studies, lapatinib in combination with capecitabine has
shown promising results compared with capecitabine alone in a
phase III trial of Her-2–positive metastatic breast cancer patients
whose cancers become unresponsive to trastuzumab or to other
therapies (12). Lapatinib in combination with tamoxifen effectively
inhibited cell proliferation and restored tamoxifen sensitivity in
estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer models with shown
resistance to tamoxifen (13, 14). Several randomized phase I
and II studies (EGF104383, EGF104535, EGF30001, EGF105767,
EGF100161, and EGF1025801) are ongoing to compare paclitaxel/
docetaxel plus lapatinib as first-line treatment for Her-2–
overexpressing breast cancer patients. But the action and
mechanisms underlying the lapatinib-induced chemosensitivity of
conventional chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells remain to be
elucidated. Gefitinib, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of
Her-1, has been reported to interact with ABCG2 and ABCB1 and
to reverse ABCB1- and/or ABCG2-mediated MDR by directly inhibiting their drug pump function in cancer cells (15). Furthermore,
ABCG2-transduced cells were found to be resistant to gefitinib
(16), and expression of ABCG2, but not its nonfunctional mutant,
protects EGFR signaling-dependent tumor cells from death
on exposure to gefitinib, and this protection was reversed by
the ABCG2-specific inhibitor Ko143 (15). These reports strongly
suggested that ABCG2 can actively pump gefitinib out of the cells.
In our previous study, we also found that erlotinib was also able
to antagonize ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR, suggesting that
it might be a substrate of these two transporters (17). Lapatinib is
also a potent and reversible inhibitor that acts at the ATP-binding
site of the tyrosine kinase domains of both EGFR and Her-2. It is
conceivable that lapatinib may inhibit functions of ABC transporters by binding to their ATP-binding sites. These have spurred
on efforts to investigate whether lapatinib can enhance the efficacy
of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs via interaction with ABC
transporters in MDR cancer cells and tumor xenograft model.

Cell lines and cell culture. The following cell lines were cultured in
essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37jC in the
presence of 5% CO2: the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and its
doxorubicin-selected derivative ABCB1-overexpressing MCF-7/adr (18), the
human epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB and its vincristine-selected
derivative ABCB1-overexpressing KBv200 (19), and the colon carcinoma cell
line S1 and its mitoxantrone-selected derivative ABCG2-overexpressing
S1-M1-80 (20). HEK293/pcDNA3.1, ABCG2-482-R5, ABCG2-482-G2, and
ABCG2-482-T7 cells were established by selection with G418 after
transfecting HEK293 with either empty pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1
vector containing full-length ABCG2 coding either arginine (R), glycine (G),
or threonine (T) at amino acid 482 position, respectively, and were cultured
in medium with 2 mg/mL G418 (21). All cells were grown in drug-free
culture medium for >2 wk before assay.
Cytotoxicity assay. The MTT assay was used to access cytotoxicity
(22, 23). In detail, cells were grown in 96-well microtiter plates. To determine
the toxicity of lapatinib, various concentrations of lapatinib diluted with
medium were added into the wells. To test the effect of lapatinib on the
chemosensitivity of cancer cells, lapatinib was added to the medium with
various concentrations of doxorubicin in MCF-7, MCF-7/adr, and MX, or
topotecan in S1 or S1-M1-80 cells, respectively, and mitoxantrone and
cisplatin in HEK293/pcDNA3.1, ABCG2-482-R5, ABCG2-482-G2, and ABCG2482-T7 cells. The concentrations required to inhibit growth by 50% (IC50)
were calculated from survival curves using the Bliss method (24). The
degree of resistance was calculated by dividing the IC50 for the MDR cells
by that of the parental sensitive cells. The degree of the reversal of MDR was
calculated by dividing the IC50 for cells with the anticancer drug in the
absence of lapatinib by that obtained in the presence of lapatinib.
Experimental animals. Athymic nude mice, 5 to 6 wk old and weighing
18 to 23 g (Center of Experimental Animals, Sun Yat-Sen University), were
used for the KBv200 cell xenografts. All animals were provided with
sterilized food and water.
MDR human carcinoma xenografts. The KBv200 cell xenograft model
was established as described by Chen and colleagues (25). Briefly, KBv200
cells grown in vitro were harvested and implanted s.c. under the shoulder
in the nude mice. When the tumors reached a mean diameter of 0.5 cm,
the mice were randomized into four groups and treated with one of the
following regimens: (a) saline (q3d  4), (b) paclitaxel (18 mg/kg, i.p.,
q3d  4), (c) lapatinib (100 mg/kg, p.o., q3d  4), and (d) paclitaxel
(18 mg/kg, i.p., q3d  4) + lapatinib (100 mg/kg, p.o., q3d  4, given 1 h
before giving paclitaxel). The body weight of the animals was measured
every 3 d to adjust the drug dosage. The two perpendicular diameters
(A and B) were recorded every 3 d and tumor volume (V ) was estimated
according to the following formula (25):
V ¼

The curve of tumor growth was drawn according to tumor volume and
time of implantation. The mice were anesthetized and killed when the mean
of tumor weights was over 1 g in the control group. Tumor tissue was
excised from the mice and weighted. The rate of inhibition (IR) was
calculated according to the following formula (25):

Doxorubicin and mitoxantrone accumulation. The intracellular
doxorubicin accumulation in ABCB1-overexpessing MCF-7/adr cells and
their parental sensitive MCF-7 cells was examined by flow cytometry
(26). The logarithmically growing cells were treated with 0.625, 1.25, or
2.5 Amol/L of lapatinib at 37jC for 3 h. Then, 10 Amol/L doxorubicin was
added to the medium and the incubation continued for another 3 h. The
cells were then collected, centrifuged, and washed twice with cold PBS
containing 10 Amol/L verapamil. Cells were resuspended in 200 AL PBS

and then analyzed by flow cytometry (Elite, Beckman Coulter), with an
excitation wavelength of 488 nm (argon laser) for the mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) of intracellular doxorubicin. The relative value of drug
accumulation was identified by dividing the MFI for each measurement by
that of the ABCB1-expressing cells in the absence of lapatinib.
The accumulation of mitoxantrone in ABCG2-transfected cells was
measured using [3H]mitoxantrone. Confluent cells in 24-well plates were
preincubated with or without lapatinib for 1 h at 37jC. To measure drug
accumulation, the cells were then incubated with 0.2 Amol/L [3H]mitoxantrone for 2 h in the presence or absence of lapatinib at 37jC. After
washing thrice with ice-cold PBS, the cells were typsinized and lysed in
10 mmol/L lysis buffer (pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS).
Each sample was placed in scintillation fluid and radioactivity was
measured in a Packard Tri-Carb 1900CA liquid scintillation analyzer from
Packard Instrument Company, Inc.
Preparation of membrane vesicles and total cell lysates. Membrane
vesicles were prepared by the nitrogen cavitation method as previously
described (17, 27). Vesicles were stored at 80jC until ready for use. To
prepare the total cell lysates, cells were harvested and rinsed twice with
PBS. Cell extracts were prepared with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
(1 PBS, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 Ag/mL
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin) for
30 min with occasional rocking and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000  g
at 4jC for 15 min. The supernatant containing total cell lysates was stored at
80jC until it was ready for use. The protein concentration was determined
by Bradford method. High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were infected with
the recombinant baculovirus carrying the human ABCB1 or ABCG2 cDNAs
with a His6 tag at the COOH-terminal end {[BV-MDR1(His6)] or [BV-(His6)ABCG2]} as described previously, and the membrane vesicles of High Five
insect cells were prepared as previously described (28) and stored at 70jC.
In vitro transport assays. Transport assays were performed essentially
using the rapid filtration method as previously described (17, 29).
Membrane vesicles were incubated with various concentrations of lapatinib
for 1 h on ice, and then transport reactions were carried out at 37jC for
10 min in a total volume of 50 AL medium {membrane vesicles 10 Ag,
0.25 mol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
4 mmol/L ATP or 4 mmol/L AMP, 10 mmol/L phosphocreatine, 100 Ag/mL
creatine phosphokinase, and 0.5 Amol/L [3H]methotrexate or 0.25 Amol/L
[3H]E217hG}. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 mL of ice-cold
stop solution [0.25 mol/L sucrose, 100 mmol/L NaCl, and 10 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.4)]. During the rapid filtration step, samples were passed through
0.22-Am GVWP filters (Millipore Corp.) presoaked in the stop solution. The
filters were washed thrice with 3 mL of ice-cold stop solution. Radioactivity
was measured by the use of a liquid scintillation counter.
ATPase assay of ABCB1 and ABCG2. The Vi-sensitive ATPase activity
of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in the membrane vesicles of High Five insect cells was
measured as previously described (30). The membrane vesicles (10 Ag
protein) were incubated in ATPase assay buffer [50 mmol/L MES (pH 6.8),
50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L sodium azide, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 2 mmol/L DTT,
1 mmol/L ouabain, 10 mmol/L MgCl2] with or without 0.3 mmol/L
vanadate at 37jC for 5 min and then incubated with different
concentrations of lapatinib at 37jC for 3 min. The ATPase reaction was
induced by the addition of 5 mmol/L Mg-ATP, and the total volume was
0.1 mL. After incubation at 37jC for 20 min, the reactions were stopped by
loading 0.1 mL of 5% SDS solution. The liberated inorganic phosphate (Pi)
was measured as described previously (17, 30).
Photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP. The
photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP was performed
as previously described (17, 31). We have used the crude membranes from
MCF-7/Flv1000 cells expressing R482 ABCG2 and membrane vesicles of
High Five insect cells expressing ABCB1 for photolabeling experiments. The
membranes (50 Ag protein) were incubated at room temperature with
different concentrations of lapatinib in the ATPase assay buffer with
[125I]IAAP (7 nmol/L) for 5 min under subdued light. The samples were
photo-cross-linked with 365 nm UV light for 10 min at room temperature.
ABCG2 was immunoprecipitated using BXP21 antibody (32), whereas
ABCB1 was immunoprecipitated as described previously except that C-219

www.aacrjournals.org

antibody was used (30). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a
7% Tris-acetate NuPAGE gel, and the gels were dried and exposed to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at 70jC for 8 to 12 h. The radioactivity
incorporated into the ABCB1 or ABCG2 band was quantified using the
Storm 860 PhosphorImager system and ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics).
Reverse transcription-PCR. The cells were treated with lapatinib for
48 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated by Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies)
RNA Extraction kit following the manufacturer’s instruction. cDNA libraries
were prepared from drug-sensitive and MDR cells. Reverse transcription
was done with reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.). Oligonucleotide
primers for ABCB1, ABCG2, and GAPDH were synthesized commercially
(Invitrogen Co.). The primers used were the following: ABCB1, 5¶-CCCATCATTGCAATAGCAGG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-GTTCAAACTTCTGCTCCTGA-3¶
(antisense); ABCG2, 5¶-TGGCTGTCATGGCTTCAGTA-3¶ (sense) and 5¶GCCACGTGATTCTTCCACAA-3¶ (antisense); and GAPDH, 5¶-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3¶
(antisense). Using the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (PE Applied Biosystems),
reactions were carried out for ABCB1, ABCG2, and GAPDH at 94jC for
2 min for initial denaturation and then at 94jC for 30 s, 56jC for 30 s, and
72jC for 1 min. After 35 cycles of amplification, additional extensions were
done at 72jC for 10 min. Products were resolved and examined by 2%
agarose gel electrophoresis (24).
Western blot analysis. To determine whether lapatinib affects the
expression of ABCB1 or ABCG2, the cells were incubated with different
concentrations of lapatinib for 48 h. To test whether lapatinib is able to
block Akt or Erk1/2 phosphorylation, we incubated cells with different
concentrations of lapatinib (0.625–2.5 Amol/L) for different periods
(12–48 h). Then, the cells were harvested and rinsed twice with PBS. Cell
extracts were prepared by incubating with buffer (1 PBS, 1% NP40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 Ag/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin) for 30 min with occasional
rocking and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 15 min at 4jC.
Identical amounts (100 Ag protein) of cell lysates were incubated at 37jC for
20 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After being incubated in blocking
solution containing 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20] for 1 h at 4jC, membranes were
incubated with the appropriately diluted primary antibody. The expression
of GAPDH was used as a loading control. The membranes were then
incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibody at 1:1,000 dilution. Proteins were detected by the enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). Protein expression was
quantified by Scion Image software (Scion Co.; ref. 33).
Flow cytometry. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by the addition
of 0.5 mmol/L EDTA followed by three washes with an isotonic PBS buffer
[supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)]. For EGFR flow
cytometric analysis, f1  106 MCF-7, MCF-7/adr, S1, and S1-M1-80 cells
(100 AL) were incubated at 4jC for 45 min with 20 AL of R-PE–conjugated
anti-human EGFR reagent. Following this incubation, cells were washed
twice with PBS buffer (supplemented with 0.5% BSA) and the supernatant
was discarded. Finally, the cells were resuspended in 400 AL PBS buffer
for flow cytometric analysis. Isotype control samples were treated in an
identical manner with PE-labeled mouse IgG2bn antibody. For Her-2
expression analysis, 10 AL of PE-conjugated anti-human ErbB2 reagent were
mixed with 25 AL of cells (4  106/mL). After incubating for 45 min at 4jC,
the cells were washed twice with PBS buffer (supplemented with 0.5% BSA)
and resuspended in 400 AL PBS buffer for flow cytometric analysis. Isotype
control samples were treated in an identical manner with PE-labeled mouse
IgG2b antibody (34).
Statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated at least thrice and
statistical significance was determined using the Student’s t test.
Significance was determined at P < 0.05.

chemotherapeutic agents in various pairs of sensitive and resistant
cells in different concentrations of lapatinib are shown in Table 1.
In ABCB1-overexpressing MCF-7/adr cells, lapatinib produced a
significant dose-dependent increase in the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in MCF-7/adr cells. In contrast, lapatinib only produced a
f2-fold sensitization to doxorubicin in the parental MCF-7
cells. Importantly, lapatinib, at the lowest concentration tested
(0.625 Amol/L), was still able to reverse resistance to doxorubicin

effects of lapatinib alone in different cell lines using the MTT
assay. More than 90% of cells were viable at concentrations of
lapatinib up to 2.5 Amol/L in MCF-7, MCF-7/adr, S1, and S1-M1-80
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, lapatinib at 10 Amol/L
had virtually no cytotoxic effects on HEK293 cells (Supplementary

Reversal of Multidrug Resistance by Lapatinib

at 6.5-fold in MCF-7/adr cells. When MCF-7 and MCF-7/adr cells
were incubated with the specific ABCG2 inhibitor FTC at
2.5 Amol/L, we found that FTC did not significantly affect the
toxicity of doxorubicin in either MCF-7 or MCF-7/adr cell lines
(Table 1). This result indicated that lapatinib reverses the resistance of MCF-7/adr cells by interacting with ABCB1. Lapatinib
also significantly decreased resistance to mitoxantrone and topotecan in ABCG2-overexpressing S1-M1-80 cells. In addition, a small
synergetic effect was also observed for the combination of lapatinib with either topotecan or mitoxantrone in the parental S1
cells but FTC did not significantly enhance the toxic effects of
mitoxantrone in parental S1 cells (Table 1). These results suggest
that lapatinib strongly enhances the sensitivity of ABCB1- and
ABCG2-overexpressing MDR cells to conventional chemotherapeutic agents but has only a slight effect in the parental cells.
Recent studies have shown that mutations at amino acid 482
in ABCG2 affect the substrate and antagonist specificity of ABCG2
(21, 35). Therefore, we investigated whether lapatinib would reverse
ABCG2-mediated resistance to mitoxantrone in cells transfected
with either the wild-type (R482) or mutant (R482G and R482T)
forms of ABCG2. As shown in Table 2, the IC50 values for mitoxantrone in three ABCG2-transfected cell lines ABCG2-482-R5,
ABCG2-482-G2, and ABCG2-482-T7 cells were significantly greater
than those in their parental cell line HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells. Lapatinib, at 2.5 and 10 Amol/L, significantly reduced the IC50 value
for mitoxantrone and reversed resistance to mitoxantrone in cells
expressing either wild-type or mutant ABCG2. In addition, the
reversal effect produced by lapatinib at 10 Amol/L was similar to
that of the specific ABCG2 inhibitor FTC at 2.5 Amol/L and better
than that of another EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib
at 10 Amol/L (Table 2). There was no significant difference in the
IC50 values for mitoxantrone in the presence or absence of lapatinib in HEK293/pcDNA3 cells (Table 2). In addition, lapatinib did
not significantly alter the IC50 values of cisplatin, which is not a
substrate of ABCG2 in any of the cell lines. These results suggest
that lapatinib specifically enhances the sensitivity of ABCG2
substrates in cells expressing either wild-type or mutant R482G/T
ABCG2.
Lapatinib enhances the accumulation of chemotherapeutic
agents in MDR cells overexpressing ABCB1 and ABCG2. The
results above indicated that lapatinib could enhance the sensitivity
of MDR cells to certain chemotherapeutic agents. The mechanism
by which this occurs is unknown. Therefore, we examined its
effects on doxorubicin accumulation in ABCB1-expressing MCF-7/
adr cells and parental MCF-7 cells. Figure 1A illustrates the effect
of lapatinib on the accumulation of doxorubicin in the MCF-7/adr
and MCF-7 cells. Doxorubicin accumulation was significantly
higher (4.2-fold) in the sensitive MCF-7 cells than in the MDR
MCF-7/adr cells. In contrast, the level of doxorubicin accumulation
in the drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells was unaffected by 0.625, 1.25, or
2.5 Amol/L of lapatinib. In the absence of lapatinib, the level of
doxorubicin accumulation was low in MCF-7/adr cells and
lapatinib restored the level of doxorubicin accumulation to that
of the parental cells in a dose-dependent manner. The intracellular
accumulation of doxorubicin was 1.5-, 2.9-, and 3.6-fold higher
in MCF-7/adr cells in the presence of 0.625, 1.25, or 2.5 Amol/L
of lapatinib, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 1B, in all cells
overexpressing ABCG2, lapatinib at 1 and 2.5 Amol/L produced
a concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular accumulation of [3H]mitoxantrone, and the effects of lapatinib at
2.5 Amol/L were similar to that of FTC at 2.5 Amol/L. However,

lapatinib did not significantly alter the intracellular accumulation
of [3H]mitoxantrone in HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells. These results
show that lapatinib was able to increase intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents in cells expressing ABCB1 or
ABCG2.

activity of ABCB1. B, beryllium fluoride–sensitive ATPase activity of ABCG2. Inset, effect of lower concentrations of lapatinib on ABCG2-ATPase. The ATP hydrolysis
in membrane vesicles was determined with different concentrations of lapatinib, as described in Materials and Methods. The basal ATPase activity (in the absence
of lapatinib) was subtracted from the activities obtained at the indicated lapatinib concentrations and the graph was fitted by nonlinear least-squares regression
analysis using GraphPad Prism version 2.0. Points, mean of at least three independent experiments; bars, SE. The photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 (C ) and ABCG2 (D )
with [125I]IAAP was performed using indicated concentrations of lapatinib as described in Materials and Methods. The radioactivity incorporated into ABCB1 and
ABCG2 was determined by exposing the gel to an X-ray film at 70jC. C and D, autoradiograms and quantification of incorporation of IAAP into the ABCB1
and ABCG2 band, respectively, from at least three independent experiments.

Lapatinib inhibits the transport of [3H]methotrexate and
[ H]E217BG by wild-type ABCG2. To further confirm the effect of
lapatinib on the transport activity of ABCG2, we used membrane
vesicles prepared from HEK293/pcDNA3 and ABCG2-482-R5 cells
to perform inhibition experiments. We chose these two cell lines
as the rate of ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]methotrexate, an antifolate anticancer drug, and a substrate of ABCG2 in membranes
isolated from HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells was significantly different
from membrane vesicles of ABCG2-482-R5 cells but not from
membrane vesicles of ABCG2-482-G2 and ABCG2-482-T7 cell lines
(17). The effect of lapatinib on the transport of methotrexate by
ABCG2 was shown in Fig. 1C. The rates of [3H]methotrexate
uptake were significantly inhibited by lapatinib in a concentrationdependent manner. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of lapatinib on methotrexate transport by ABCG2 membrane vesicles
is comparable with that of erlotinib and FTC (Fig. 1C). In addition, lapatinib produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of
[3H]E217hG, another substrate of ABCG2 (data not shown). These
transport results suggest that lapatinib inhibits the transport of
[3H]methotrexate and [3H]E217hG in wild-type ABCG2-482-R5–
expressing cells.

Lapatinib activates the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and
ABCG2. The drug efflux function of ABCB1 and ABCG2 is linked
to ATP hydrolysis, which is stimulated in the presence of ABCB1
and ABCG2 substrates. To assess the effect of lapatinib on the
ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2, we measured ABCB1- and
ABCG2-mediated ATP hydrolysis using various concentrations of
lapatinib under conditions that suppressed the activity of other
major membrane ATPases. As shown in Fig. 2, lapatinib affected
the ATPase activity of ABCB1 (Fig. 2A) and ABCG2 (Fig. 2B) in a
concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the maximum
ATPase activities of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in the presence of lapatinib
were up to 42.9 F 1.9 and 64.9 F 1.7 nmol Pi/mg protein/min,
respectively. Interestingly, lapatinib significantly stimulates the
ATPase activities of ABCG2 at extremely low concentrations. This
is not easily observed in Fig. 2B. Consequently, only the low
concentrations of lapatinib affecting the ATPase of ABCG2 are
presented in Fig. 2B (inset). These data indicated that lapatinib
may be a substrate of ABCB1 and ABCG2.
Lapatinib affects the photolabeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2
with [125I]IAAP. ABCB1 and ABCG2 can be photolabeled by a
photoaffinity analogue of prazosin, [125I]IAAP, and their substrates

as well as inhibitors can compete for [125I]IAAP labeling of ABCB1
and ABCG2 (32). We therefore examined the photolabeling of
ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP by incubating membrane
vesicles in the presence of various concentrations of lapatinib to
primarily understand the physical interaction of lapatinib with the
substrate interaction sites of ABCB1 and ABCG2. As indicated
in Fig. 2, lapatinib strongly inhibited the photoaffinity labeling
of ABCB1 (Fig. 2C) and ABCG2 (Fig. 2D) with [125I]IAAP in a
concentration-dependent manner. The concentration of lapatinib
required for 50% inhibition of photolabeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2
with [125I]IAAP was 2.8 F 0.6 Amol/L and 3.2 F 1.1 Amol/L,
respectively. The results suggest that lapatinib binds to both the
ABCB1 and ABCG2 substrate-binding site(s) with high affinity.
EGFR and Her-2 status and effect of lapatinib on the
blockade of Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Using the MTT
assay as an index of cytotoxicity, we observed that lapatinib alone
does not produce significant cytotoxic effects in MCF-7 and S1 cell
lines. However, nontoxic concentrations of lapatinib significantly
enhance the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in MCF-7 cells,
whereas FTC does not significantly enhance the cytotoxic effects of
doxorubicin in MCF-7 cells (Table 1). To determine whether the
relative lack of cytotoxicity produced by lapatinib is related to the
expression of EGFR and/or Her-2, we used flow cytometry to detect
EGFR and Her-2 in MCF-7 and S1 cell lines (Fig. 3B). Calu-3,
a positive control cell line, expressed relative high levels of both
EGFR (66.6 F 2.8%) and Her-2 (97.5 F 1.2%). The expression level
of EGFR in S1 cells (65.0 F 4.9%) is significantly higher than that in
S1-M1-80 cells (37.6 F 2.5%), whereas the expression level of Her-2
in S1 cells (29.3 F 3.1%) is significantly lower than that in S1-M1-80
cells (49.3 F 6.6%). MCF-7 cell expressed low levels of EGFR (10.8 F
2.7%), whereas the MCF-7/adr cell line showed high expression
(65.0 F 4.5%). However, the MCF-7 (28.8 F 2.2%) and MCF-7/adr
(8.2 F 0.5%) cell lines expressed low levels of Her-2. These results
indicated that lapatinib potentiates the cytotoxic effects of
anticancer drugs independent of the level of EGFR and Her-2
expression. Furthermore, we tested whether the concentrations of
lapatinib that we used in our experiments can inhibit the
phosphorylation of Akt or Erk1/2. As shown in Fig. 3A, lapatinib
did not significantly block the phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2
in any of the four cell sublines. This result suggested that lapatinibinduced enhancement of the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic
agents in MCF-7, MCF-7/adr, S1, and S1-M1-80 cells is not due to
its antagonism of EGFR and Her-2 receptors.
Effect of lapatinib on the expression of mRNA and protein
levels of ABCB1 and ABCG2. The reversal of ABC transportermediated MDR can be achieved either by decreasing transporter
expression or by inhibiting function. Therefore, we determined the
effect of lapatinib on the expression level of mRNA and protein
levels using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot,
respectively. Our results showed that no marked difference in
ABCB1 or ABCG2 expression at the mRNA (Fig. 3C) or protein level
(Fig. 3D) was observed in MCF-7/adr cells (top) or S1-M1-80 cells
(bottom) treated with lapatinib for 48 h compared with untreated
cells. These results provide evidence that lapatinib does not affect
the expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Thus, it mediates the reversal
of MDR by inhibiting the function of ABCB1 and ABCG2.
Lapatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in vivo. We
examined the efficacy of lapatinib in vivo to reverse the resistance
to paclitaxel using established KBv200 cell xenografts in nude mice.
There was no significant difference in tumor size between animals
treated with saline, lapatinib, or paclitaxel alone. However, the

combination of lapatinib and paclitaxel produced a significant
greater inhibitory effect on tumor growth compared with animals
treated with only saline, paclitaxel, or lapatinib (P < 0.05; Fig. 4) and
the inhibition rate was 50.1%. In addition, at the doses tested, no
mortality or significant decrease in body weight was associated
with the combination treatments, suggesting that the combination
regimen did not result in increased toxicity.

Discussion
Lapatinib is an inhibitor of the intracellular tyrosine kinase
domains of both the EGFR and Her-2 receptors. Mutations or
dysregulation in these receptors has been shown to play a role in
the development of certain cancers. Lapatinib was approved for
use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of patients
with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpressed Her-2 and who had received prior therapy with an
anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab. As the new TKIs are
being introduced into the clinic, a significant effort will be
directed toward increasing the anticancer activity of conventional
chemotherapeutic agents or restoring chemosensitivity of resistant
cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Our results
showed for the first time that lapatinib had potent reversing
activity in both ABCB1- and ABCG2-expressing MDR cells in vitro.
Lapatinib, however, had no significant reversal effect in ABCC4overexpressing NIH3T3/ABCC4-2 cells and lung cancer-resistant
protein–overexpressing SW1573/2R1220 cells.5 Although lapatinib

slightly enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, mitoxantrone,
and topotecan in drug-sensitive MCF-7 and S1 cells, respectively,
lapatinib significantly potentiated the cytotoxicity of conventional
chemotherapeutic agents in ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing
MDR cells to a much greater extent. Furthermore, lapatinib did
not significantly alter cellular sensitivity to non-ABCB1 or nonABCG2 substrates. Although the concentrations of lapatinib used
in the current study (up to 2.5 Amol/L for MCF-7 and S1 cells)
have been reported to be sufficient to block the EGFR signaling
pathway, we did not observe any significant effect on the growth
and survival of cells (Supplementary Fig. S1 and S2). In addition,
we found that 2.5 Amol/L lapatinib does not block the phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 (Fig. 3A) in MCF-7 and S1 cell lines.
Thus, the potentiation of the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin
by lapatinib in MCF-7 cells may not be related to the antagonism of EGFR or Her-2 receptors. It is possible that this effect
may be generated by a nonspecific cytotoxic mechanism or other
unknown action of the drug. To determine if the in vitro effects
of lapatinib can be extended to an in vivo paradigm, we have
examined the effect of lapatinib on the antitumor activity of paclitaxel in xenograft model in mouse. Indeed, our results indicated
that the combination of lapatinib with paclitaxel results in
markedly enhanced antitumor activity of paclitaxel in an ABCB1overexpressing tumor xenograft model (Fig. 4A and B).
Our results suggest that lapatinib significantly potentiated the
toxicity of established ABCB1 or ABCG2 substrates in ABCB1- or
ABCG2-overexpressing MDR cells unrelated to its inhibitory
action of tyrosine kinase. Several groups have published in vitro
data that support our findings. Coley and colleagues (36) reported
that the addition of GW282974A, an analogue of lapatinib, to

Reversal of Multidrug Resistance by Lapatinib

paclitaxel resulted in a synergistic inhibition of cell survival in
ABCB1-expressing human ovarian cancer cell line PEO1TaxR. The
dual EGFR and Her-2 directed small-molecule TKI CI1033
enhanced the uptake and cytotoxicity of SN-38 and topotecan
in ABCG2-expressing glioblastoma T98G cells, colorectal carcinoma HCT8 cells, and ABCG2-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells (37).
Recently, Polli and colleagues (38) reported that lapatinib is a
substrate of ABCB1 and ABCG2 and an inhibitor of ABCB1 and
ABCG2 (IC50 values of 3.9 and 0.025 Amol/L, respectively). Their
results are not only consistent with our findings that lapatinib is
an inhibitor of ABCB1 and ABCG2, but their data are also in
agreement with our findings that low concentrations of lapatinib
are able to stimulate the ATPase activity of ABCG2 (Fig. 2A
and B) and inhibit the photolabeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with
IAAP (Fig. 2C and D), indicating that lapatinib directly interacts
with these transporters. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that
the pharmacokinetics of conventional chemotherapeutic agents
that are affected by ABC transporters may be altered in the
presence of lapatinib.
Clinical studies have also hinted at interactions between
lapatinib and ABC transporters. Lapatinib has been shown to
have clinical benefit in patients with brain-metastasized breast
cancer, increasing drug penetration across the blood-brain barrier,
presumably via inhibition of ABCB1 (37). The combination of
lapatinib and tamoxifen and ABCB1 substrate or conventional
chemotherapeutic agents, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, may be
active against hormone-refractory and chemotherapeutic drugresistant metastasized breast cancer (14, 39–41). In the phase I
study, when compared with irinotecan alone, the coadministration
of lapatinib and irinotecan significantly increased the area under
the plasma concentration-time curve of SN-38, the active
metabolite of irinotecan, which is an ABCB1 and ABCG2 substrate
(42). Despite the aforementioned promising findings, the authors
of these articles did not propose any clear mechanisms to explain
the synergy between lapatinib and chemotherapeutic agents.
However, in human pharmacokinetic studies, the highest peak
plasma lapatinib level was f3 Amol/L, the half-life was f17 h,
and steady-state concentrations were achieved after 6 to 7 days
of once-daily dosing (43, 44). These data suggest that the in vitro
concentrations of lapatinib used in our experiments are similar
to those obtained in plasma after therapeutic treatment. Thus,
it is possible that lapatinib affects chemosensitivity of refractory
or resistant cancer cells through its interaction with ABC
transporters.
Recently, Cusatis and colleagues (45) reported that one common
functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in the ABCG2 gene,
ABCG2 421C!A (Q141K), is associated with diarrhea, a gefitinibinduced adverse effect, and led to a high risk of diarrhea in patients
treated with oral gefitinib. The same group also reported that
this functional variant of ABCG2 was associated with a greater
accumulation of gefitinib at steady state and this may be relevant
to toxicity and antitumor activity of EGFR TKIs (46). These findings
suggest that the functional variants of ABCG2 in patients may
affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of not only
established ABCG2 substrates, such as camptothecins and mitoxantrone, but also novel molecular target anticancer drugs, such
as gefitinib and lapatinib. Therefore, these functional singlenucleotide polymorphisms can cause alterations in the adverse
events and therapeutic effects of chemotherapy. Similar to
gefitinib, the most frequent adverse effects of lapatinib in patients
are skin rash and diarrhea (47). Thus, these functional single-

www.aacrjournals.org

nucleotide polymorphisms of ABCG2 in patients may also affect
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lapatinib, resulting in an attenuation of its adverse events and therapeutic
effects.
The expression of the Arg482, Gly482, and Thr482 variant forms
of ABCG2 has been shown to confer greater resistance to some
substrates, such as mitoxantrone, and the sensitivity to some
ABCG2 modulators is decreased compared with the wild-type form
(48–50). Our results showed that lapatinib significantly enhances
the sensitivity of ABCG2 substrates not only in cells overexpressing
wild-type but also in the R482G/T variants of ABCG2. Mechanistically, similar to other MDR inhibitors, lapatinib may be able to
reverse ABCB1- or ABCG2-mediated drug resistance by inhibiting
drug efflux. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that
incubating MDR cells (such as MCF-7/adr and S1-M1-80 cells)
concomitantly with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (substrates of ABC transporters) and lapatinib resulted in a higher
intracellular drug accumulation in ABCB1- and ABCG2-expressing
cells than cells incubated with drug alone (Fig. 1A and B). A similar
result was obtained when we examined accumulation of rhodamine 123 in ABCB1-expressing cells (data not shown). Furthermore, the transport of E217hG and methotrexate inhibited by
lapatinib in a concentration-dependent manner in membrane
vesicles overexpressed wild-type ABCG2. However, the majority of
substrates that interact with the ABC drug transporters stimulate
ATP hydrolysis, and the fact that lapatinib stimulated the ATP
hydrolysis of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 suggested that it behaved
similarly to other known substrates of these transporters. These
data led us to speculate that lapatinib interacts directly with the
transporters. Indeed, this was confirmed by the finding that
lapatinib significantly inhibited the binding of the compound IAAP,
which photolabels the drug substrate–binding site of ABCB1 and
ABCG2. Lapatinib, however, had no significant effect on the
expression of ABCB1 in MCF-7/adr cells and ABCG2 in S1-M1-80
cells (Fig. 3C and D). These results suggested that lapatinib
reverses ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR by inhibiting the
function as opposed to expression of these two pumps. The
expression of EGFR and Her-2 (Fig. 3A) did not significantly alter
lapatinib toxicity in MCF-7/adr and S1-M1-80 cells or parental
MCF-7 and S1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Additional in vitro
studies in cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant EGFR may be
useful to determine if there is a difference in the efficacy between
tumors expressing wild-type or mutant EGFR. The observed
toxicity of lapatinib at such relatively high concentrations may be
generated by a non-EGFR phosphorylation pathway. However, in
this study, we did not examine the potential mechanisms of
lapatinib toxicity in our cell lines.
In conclusion, lapatinib may inhibit cellular ABCB1 and ABCG2
functions at clinically relevant concentrations. The inhibition of
drug efflux as a result of direct interaction of lapatinib with ABCB1
or ABCG2 may lead to increased clinical response when combined
with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Our analysis of the
reversal effect of lapatinib in tumor xenograft model indicates
that combination of lapatinib with other anticancer drugs may
be important in surmounting clinical resistance in cancer chemotherapy.
