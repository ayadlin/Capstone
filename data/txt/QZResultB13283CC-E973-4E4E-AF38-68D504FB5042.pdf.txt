ABSTRACT
Molecularly targeted drugs are used in the treatment of a variety of malignant
tumors, but this approach to developing novel therapies for oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) has lagged behind the progress seen for other cancers. We have
attempted to find appropriate molecular targets for OSCC and identified cell division
cycle associated 5 (CDCA5) as a cancer-related gene which was overexpressed in all
the human OSCC cells tested by microarray analysis. In this study, we investigated
the expression and function of CDCA5 in OSCC. First, we confirmed that CDCA5 was
overexpressed in 4 human OSCC cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR and Western
blotting. We then tested the effect of synthetic small interfering RNAs specific for
CDCA5 on the growth and invasion of human OSCC cells. Knockdown of CDCA5
markedly inhibited the growth of OSCC cells in vitro and in vivo. We also examined the
expression of CDCA5 protein in 80 cases of OSCC immunohistochemically and found a
significant association between CDCA5 expression levels and overall survival. These
results suggest that CDCA5 functions as a critical gene supporting OSCC progression
and that targeting CDCA5 may be a useful therapeutic strategy for OSCC.

INTRODUCTION

maintaining the cancer phenotype also provides molecular
targets, which can be exploited in cancer therapy [3].
Recent studies of human malignancies have shown that it
is possible to use pharmacological agents that inactivate
oncogenes to treat some types of human cancer. For
example, imatinib, which targets breakpoint cluster
region-abelson (BCR-ABL), is used to treat patients with
chronic myelogenous leukemia [4] and crizotinib, which
targets anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), is used to treat
patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer [5].
Although targeting oncogenes in this way has provided
novel therapeutic opportunities, the development of
molecular targeted therapy for OSCC has lagged behind
other cancers. Therefore, we have attempted to identify
appropriate molecular targets for OSCC. In a previous
study, we used microarray analysis and Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) to identify 465 cancer-related genes that
were overexpressed in all the human OSCC cell lines
examined [6]. Among these genes, we identified cell

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is estimated
263,000 new cases and 127,000 deaths in 2008 worldwide
[1]. OSCC has a high potential to invade local tissue
and metastasize to lymph nodes, and has a mortality
rate of approximately 50% within 5 years [2]. Despite
our increasing knowledge of OSCC pathogenesis and
advances in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery,
little improvement in the relative survival rate of patients
with OSCC has been observed in the past several decades
[2]. Therefore, novel strategies based on a greater
understanding of the pathogenesis of OSCC are needed
for the development of improved therapeutic approaches.
Cancer cells acquire abnormalities in multiple
oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Overexpression
and constitutive activation of some of these oncogenes
support the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of
cancer cells. However, this dependence on oncogenes for

division cycle associated 5 (CDCA5) as a substrate of the
anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and as a regulator
of sister chromatid cohesion in HeLa cells [7-9]. CDCA5
protein is degraded through Cdc20 homolog 1 (Cdh1)activated APC (APCcdh1)-dependent ubiquitination in the
G1 phase and is required for sister chromatid cohesion in
the S and G2 phases [7]. Furthermore, CDCA5 has been
reported to be overexpressed in the majority of human
lung cancers and urothelial cancers and to play a critical
role in carcinogenesis [10-13].
In this study, we investigated the expression and
function of CDCA5 in OSCC to clarify whether targeting

CDCA5 is likely to be a promising strategy for the
treatment of OSCC.

RESULTS
Overexpression of CDCA5 in human OSCC cells

RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). High levels of CDCA5 mRNA
expression were observed in all OSCC cell lines compared
with the human immortalized non-neoplastic keratinocyte
cell line, HaCaT (Figure 1A). Subsequently, we examined
the expression levels of CDCA5 protein by Western blot
analysis and detected its abundant expression in OSCC
cells, whereas its expression was hardly detectable in
HaCaT cells (Figure 1B). These results showed that both
CDCA5 mRNA and protein were overexpressed in human
OSCC cells.

excised tumor tissue was markedly suppressed, by 53%,
in the group treated with siCDCA5 (Figure 4B). During
the administration of siCDCA5, no reduction in either
food intake or body weight was seen in the mice. We also
examined the expression of interferon response genes
such as interferon stimulated gene factor 3 γ (ISGF-3γ),
2’, 5’-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2), and interferoninduced myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MX1) in liver
and lung tissues from mice by qRT-PCR. There was no
significantly induction of these genes by treatment with
siGFP or siCDCA5/atelocollagen complex (data not
shown).

Effect of CDCA5 suppression on the growth of
human OSCC cells in vitro

Effect of targeting CDCA5 in primary human
OSCC cultured cells

We clarified the function of CDCA5 in the
proliferation and invasiveness of human OSCC cells,
by transfecting them with synthetic small interfering
RNA (siRNA) specific for CDCA5 (siCDCA5) at a
concentration of 10 nM. Synthetic siCDCA5 suppressed
the expression of CDCA5 protein (Figure 2A). When we
then examined the effect of siCDCA5 on the growth and
invasion of human OSCC cells, we found that CDCA5
knockdown significantly inhibited cell growth by 5081% (Figure 2B) but not invasiveness (data not shown),
compared to an untargeted siRNA (siNT).

To confirm the usefulness of targeting CDCA5 in
OSCC, we established primary cell cultures from newly
resected tumor tissues from patients with OSCC. These
primary cultured cells were derived from two lower
gingival tumors, a lymph node metastasis, and a skin
metastasis. When we tested the effect of siCDCA5 on

Role of CDCA5 in the cell cycle in human OSCC
cells
CDCA5 has been reported to have an important role
in the cell cycle [7-9]. We therefore analyzed the effect
of siCDCA5 on the cell cycle by flow cytometry using
GFP-SAS cells. After the cells had been treated with 10
nM siCDCA5 for 48 h, significantly fewer cells were in
G0/G1 phase and significantly more were in G2 phase,
compared to cells treated with siNT (Figure 3A, 3B). The
data indicated that the anti-proliferative effect of siCDCA5
was due to an arrest in G2. Ca9-22, HSC2, and HSC3 cells
also showed the similar results (data not shown).

Effect of siCDCA5 on the in vivo growth of human
OSCC cells
We assessed the growth inhibitory effect of
siCDCA5 in vivo using a mouse model. We used GFPSAS cells for this in vivo assay because only these cells,
of the four lines we used, showed stable tumorigenicity.
We administered siCDCA5/atelocollagen complexes into
the subcutaneous spaces around the tumors every 3 days.
We found that these complexes significantly reduced the
size of subcutaneously xenografted GFP-SAS tumors,
compared with the control group treated with synthetic
siRNA specific for GFP (siGFP)/atelocollagen complexes
(Figure 4A). Furthermore, the expression of CDCA5 in

immunohistochemically. Most of the CDCA5 expression
in OSCC tissues was observed in tumor cells but not
stromal cells. In normal tissues, CDCA5 expression was
also detected in few lymphocytes (Figure 6B).
We also evaluated the association between CDCA5
expression, assessed immunohistochemically, in tumors
from 80 OSCC patients and their clinicopathological
parameters. We categorized CDCA5 expression as high
or low by the median value of positive rate of tumor
cells, and then examined the association between CDCA5
expression and the clinicopathological parameters of the

To clarify the clinical significance of CDCA5
expression, we examined the expression of CDCA5 in
OSCC tissue (n = 20). The expression of CDCA5 mRNA
in tumor and adjacent normal tissue derived from the same
patient was examined by qRT-PCR. Expression levels of
CDCA5 mRNA in OSCC tissue were significantly higher
than in normal tissue (Figure 6A). We examined CDCA5
protein expression in normal oral mucosa and OSCC tissue

inhibited the growth of human OSCC cells both in vitro
and in vivo. These results raise the possibility that CDCA5
is a novel therapeutic target for OSCC. However, at
present no CDCA5-targeted drugs are available.
Our study has also demonstrated the successful
transfection of tumor cell xenografts with siRNA
complexed with atelocollagen [6, 21]. Atelocollagenmediated siRNA delivery has been reported to be
effective in gene silencing following either local injection
directly into tumors or intravenous systemic injection.
This is because siRNA complexed with atelocollagen is
resistant to nuclease, so that siRNA can efficiently reach
a target site in vivo, without being degraded by nuclease,
when combined with an appropriate concentration of
atelocollagen [22, 23]. In addition, our recent studies
have shown that atelocollagen-mediated, systemic
administration of siRNAs specific for the androgen
receptor and three Akt isoforms resulted in significant
growth inhibition of human prostate cancer in nude mice,
without severe side effects such as lung, liver, or renal
damage [24, 25]. These results suggest that nucleic acidbased drugs, such as atelocollagen-complexed siRNA,
may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for human
malignancies, with minimal risks of adverse events.
In summary, CDCA5 is likely to play a significant
role in OSCC progression, so that targeting CDCA5 may
be a potentially useful therapeutic approach for patients
with OSCC.

OSCC patients. Although no significant relationship was
observed, high CDCA5 expression tended to be correlated
with local recurrences (Table 1). Furthermore, when we
examined the association between CDCA5 expression and
survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis, we found that high
CDCA5 expression was associated with a poor prognosis
(Figure 7A, 7B).

DISCUSSION
Although CDCA5 has been reported to have roles
in cell cycle progression in a variety of immortalized cell
lines, through its interaction with cohesin on chromatin [8,
9], there is only one report that has investigated its possible
role in carcinogenesis, in lung cancer [11]. High CDCA5
expression in lung cancer showed a significant association
with a poor prognosis for patients and also promoted
cell proliferation. In addition, CDCA5 was shown to be
phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) kinase at two phosphorylation sites, Ser79 and
Ser209, where consensus ERK phosphorylation site
sequences, which are highly conserved in many species,
were present. Ser209 phosphorylation by ERK kinase
seemed to be critically important for cancer cell growth
[11]. Furthermore, CDCA5 expression in peripheral
T cells as well as tumor cells was associated with poor
survival in lung cancer patients [10].
ERK is a member of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) family that regulates critical phases
of cell growth, including proliferation, differentiation,
transcription regulation, and development [14-16].
It is well known that MAPKs play pivotal roles in
carcinogenesis [17] and that the MAPK pathway is a key
downstream signaling pathway regulated by epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in a number of
cancers [14, 15]. Up to 90% of head and neck squamous
cell carcinomas (HNSCC), including OSCC, are known to
overexpress EGFR and this leads to excessive activation
of the EGFR signaling pathway [18, 19]. Activation of
EGFR-Raf-MAPK/ERK kinase-ERK signaling has been
reported in several cancers, including HNSCC, and has
led to the discovery of novel anticancer drugs. Recently,
we have been able to use the anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibody, cetuximab, to treat HNSCC patients. Compared
with platinum-fluorouracil (PF) chemotherapy alone,
cetuximab plus PF chemotherapy improved overall
survival and progression-free survival in patients with
recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, especially in OSCC
patients [20]. Therefore, targeting molecules associated
with ERK signaling, such as CDCA5, seems to be an
appropriate approach for the treatment of OSCC.
In this study, we have demonstrated the
overexpression of CDCA5 in OSCC, as well as a clinically
significant correlation between CDCA5 expression and
patient survival. Furthermore, we have demonstrated
that targeting CDCA5 using RNA interference (RNAi)

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture
We used four human OSCC cell lines, GFP-SAS
[26], Ca9-22, HSC2, and HSC3, and an immortalized
human non-neoplastic keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT,
as previously described [27, 28]. All cell lines were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; Wako, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biosource Camarillo, CA, USA),
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Wako),
referred to here as complete medium.
Primary cell cultures were established from
OSCC tumors harvested from patients. Tumor tissue
was surgically excised and rinsed several times with
complete medium. Each tissue sample was cut into
small fragments and dissociated by treatment with 0.1%
collagenase (Wako) at 37°C for 2 h. The cell suspension
was filtered through a 70 µm nylon mesh cell strainer
(BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The cells were collected
by centrifugation, resuspended in keratinocyte serumfree medium (K-SFM; Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), and seeded onto plastic dishes. In K-SFM,
tumor cells could continue to grow but not stromal and

immune cells. All cells were grown in an incubator with
a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Cells (5 × 105 for GFP-SAS, Ca9-22, HSC2,
and HSC3) transfected with siRNAs were grown in
monolayers for 48 h and then lysed in 0.5 M EDTA
(Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) and 1% NP-40 (Nacalai
Tesque, Kyoto Japan) in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS; Wako) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail
and a phosphatase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland). The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 g for
15 min at 4°C and the supernatants were electrophoresed
on SDS–polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford,
MA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk (Wako) in 1 × TBS-T (25 mM Tris–HCl,
125 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma–Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA)) for 1 h at room temperature. They
were then probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-CDCA5
antibody (Atlas Antibodies, Stockholm, Sweden; diluted
at 1:500), monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin antibody
(BD; diluted at 1:1000), or polyclonal goat anti-actin
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA;
diluted at 1:1000) in 5% non-fat dried milk in 1 × TBS-T
for 1 h at room temperature, followed by treatment with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
against rabbit, mouse (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire,
UK), or goat (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA)
IgG for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complexes
were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE
Healthcare). The density of visualized immune complexes
was digitized using a RAS3000 imaging system (Fujifilm,
Tokyo, Japan).

Samples from patients
Twenty OSCCs with the adjacent normal tissue and
80 paraffin-embedded OSCC samples were obtained at
the Ehime University Hospital between December 2001
and July 2012. Four primary cell cultures were derived
from OSCCs from the lower gingiva and a lymph node
metastasis (from a 55 year-old male, T4N2bM0), the
lower gingiva (from a 80 year-old female, T4N1M0), and
a skin metastasis (from a 61 year-old male, rT0N0M1).
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Ehime University
Hospital approved this study.

qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted by lysing the cells or
tissue using ISOGEN (NipponGene, Tokyo, Japan).
Tissue samples were homogenized in 1.0 ml of ISOGEN
using a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
The relative quantification of mRNA levels used the
comparative threshold cycle (CT) method (ΔΔCT
method), carried out by qRT-PCR using the SYBR®
system. Hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) was
used as internal controls. PCR amplification was carried
out in 10 μl final reaction mixtures containing 5 μl 2x One
Step SYBR® RT-PCR Buffer 4, 0.4 μl PrimeScript® One
Step Enzyme Mix 2 (Takara, Otsu, Japan), 0.4 μl forward
primer (10 μM), 0.4 μl reverse primer (10 μM), 0.2 μl
ROX reference Dye II (x 50), 2.6 μl RNase-free dH2O,
and 1 μl total RNA (100 ng/μl). The sequences of the
primers used were as follows: human CDCA5, forward
5’-ATC CAC CTC GCA GGA GCC CTA-3’ and reverse
5’-CTC TCC TTC CTT GGA GCT GGA CT-3’; human
HMBS, forward 5’-CAT GCA GGC TAC CAT CCA
TGT-3’ and reverse 5’-GTT AGC AGT GAT GCC TAC
CAA-3’. For analyzing tissue samples from mice, we
used the TaqMan® system. RT-PCR was performed in a
10 µl final reaction mixture containing 5 μl 2 × Quantitect
RT-PCR Master Mix, 0.1 μl Quantitect RT mix (Qiagen),
0.5 μl TaqMan® probe and primers (Life Technologies),
and 100 ng total RNA. The TaqMan® probe and primers
for mouse ISGF-3γ, OAS2, MX1 and HMBS were
purchased from Life Technologies. The thermal-cycling
conditions were reverse transcription at 42°C for 5 min
and 95°C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 5
s and 60°C for 30 s. SYBR® Green I or 5’-fluorescent
reporter dye fluorescence was detected with ViiATM7 (Life
Technologies).

Transfection with synthetic siRNAs
We used two siCDCA5. Synthetic siCDCA5-1 was
purchased from COSMO BIO Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan)
with the sequence: sense 5’-CGC AGG AGC CCU AGG
AUU UTT-3’ and antisense 5’-AAA UCC UAG GGC
UCC UGC GTT-3’. The second sequence, siCDCA5-2,
was designed by siDirect (http://sidirect2.rnai.jp): sense
5’-UCA AAC UCG GCA UUC AUG GTT -3’ and
antisense 5’-UGA UCC AAG AAG UAA GUU CTT-3’.
Another synthetic siNT was used as a negative control:
sense 5’-UAC GUA CUA UCG CGC GGA UTT-3’ and
antisense 5’-AUC CGC GCG ATA GUA CGU ATT3’. Transfections used Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life
Technologies) mixed with 10 nM siRNAs for Western
blotting and cell proliferation assays.

Cell growth assay

Tumor diameters were measured at regular intervals using
digital calipers and tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated
using the formula: length × width × height × 0.523. Three
mice were used in each group. Thirteen days after the first
administration of siRNAs, the GFP-SAS xenografts were
dissected and the CDCA5 protein expression levels were
determined by western blotting. The animal studies were
approved by the Ehime University animal care committee.

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates, using 2 ×
103/well for GFP-SAS and 3 × 103/well for HSC2, HSC3,
and Ca9-22, in complete medium with 10 nM synthetic
siRNAs and 0.2% Lipofectamine RNAiMAX in a final
volume of 100 μl. After 72 h, cell growth was evaluated
using WST-8 assays (Cell counting Kit-8; Dojindo).

Immunohistochemistry

Invasion assay

The surgically resected OSCC specimens were
fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and embedded
in paraffin. A series of 4 µm thick tissue sections were
prepared from each sample. Immunohistochemistry was
performed using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex
method. Briefly, the deparaffinized sections were
incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in distilled water for 5 min
to block endogenous peroxidase activity, and treated at
121°C in an autoclave for 20 min in 10 mM citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) to regenerate epitopes. The sections were then
incubated for 30 min at room temperature with antiCDCA5 antibody (diluted 1:50; Atlas Antibodies). After
washing, the sections were overlaid with biotinylated antirabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,
USA) at room temperature for 30 min, washed in TBS-T,
and then labeled with streptavidin-peroxidase complex
(Vector Laboratories). The sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin, dehydrated with ethanol, treated with
xylene, and mounted in synthetic resin. We selected three
hot spots for measuring labeled cells using a BIOREVO
BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) and the
prevalence of CDCA5 positive cells were calculated using
Dynamic cell count BZ-H1C software (Keyence) [29].
Immunohistochemical staining for CDCA5 protein was
categorized as high or low by the median value of positive
rate of tumor cells.

The cell invasion was measured using a Corning®
BioCoatTM FluoroBlokTM 24-Multiwell Insert System
(Corning, Corning, NY, USA). GFP-SAS cells were
treated with siRNAs for 24 h, after which they were
trypsinized, counted, and normalized for cell number
between treatments. Cells (1 × 105) in serum-free DMEM
were placed in an insert made of polycarbonate membrane
with 8-μm pores and precoated with basement membrane
matrix. The outer chamber was filled with 0.5 ml of
DMEM containing 5% FBS. The plate was incubated
at 37°C for 24 hours. The fluorescence of the invaded
cells was read at 485/535 nm with ARVOTM MX 1420
Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).

Flow cytometry
Human OSCC cells were transfected with 10 nM
synthetic siCDCA5 with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX for
48 h. After incubation, cells were detached with trypsin
at 37°C, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended
in 10 ml ice cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. The prepared cells
were washed twice with PBS and then incubated at 37°C
for 15 min in 0.25 mg/ml bovine pancreas ribonuclease
A (Sigma-Aldrich), using 1 ml per 1 × 106 cells. The
suspensions were stained with propidium iodide solution
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C for 30 min and analyzed using
an EPICS XL-MCl flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA, USA).

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was used to determine the
significance of differences between groups. Differences in
patient survival were determined using the log-rank test,
with p values < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
software, version 5.04 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
CA, USA).

Xenograft model and tumor therapy
GFP-SAS cells were complexed with Matrigel®
(BD) using 2 × 106 cells per 100 μl aliquot and injected
subcutaneously at two sites in the flanks of male athymic
nude mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan). One week later,
tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly divided into two
treatment groups, receiving either siCDCA5-1 or siGFP
with the sequence: sense 5’-CUA CAA CAG CCA CAA
CGU CTT-3’ and antisense 5’-GAC GUU GUG GCU
GUU GUA GTT -3’. The siRNAs were used at a final
concentration of 20 μM in atelocollagen (AteloGene;
Koken, Tokyo, Japan). These complexes were injected into
the subcutaneous spaces around the tumors every 3 days.
