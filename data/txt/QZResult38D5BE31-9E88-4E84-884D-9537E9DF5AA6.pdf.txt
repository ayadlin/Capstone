ABSTRACT
Growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene 45 (GADD45) family proteins play
a crucial role in regulating cellular stress responses and apoptosis. The present
study explored the prognostic and predictive role of GADD45γ in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) treatment. GADD45γ expression in HCC cells was examined using
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. The control of
GADD45γ transcription was examined using a luciferase reporter assay and chromatin
immunoprecipitation. The in vivo induction of GADD45γ was performed using
adenoviral transfer. The expression of GADD45γ in HCC tumor tissues from patients
who had undergone curative resection was measured using qRT-PCR. Sorafenib
induced expression of GADD45γ mRNA and protein, independent of its RAF kinase
inhibitor activity. GADD45γ induction was more prominent in sorafenib-sensitive HCC
cells (Huh-7 and HepG2, IC50 6–7 μM) than in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells (Hep3B,
Huh-7R, and HepG2R, IC50 12–15 μM). Overexpression of GADD45γ reversed sorafenib
resistance in vitro and in vivo, whereas GADD45γ expression knockdown by using
siRNA partially abrogated the proapoptotic effects of sorafenib on sorafenib-sensitive
cells. Overexpression of survivin in HCC cells abolished the antitumor enhancement
between GADD45γ overexpression and sorafenib treatment, suggesting that survivin
is a crucial mediator of antitumor effects of GADD45γ. GADD45γ expression decreased
in tumors from patients with HCC who had undergone curative surgery, and low
GADD45γ expression was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival, in
addition to old age and vascular invasion. The preceding data indicate that GADD45γ
suppression is a poor prognostic factor in patients with HCC and may help predict
sorafenib efficacy in HCC.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, is the current
standard systemic therapy for patients with advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1]. The major
mechanism of action includes inhibition of the Raf/
mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signalregulated kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) signaling and inhibition of tumor
angiogenesis [2]. However, the antitumor mechanisms
of sorafenib may involve complex interactions in
cellular signaling pathways, which are independent of
the inhibitory effects of sorafenib on Raf/MEK/ERK
activities [3–6]. Clarification of these “off-target effects”
of sorafenib will facilitate identification of predictive
biomarkers for treatment efficacy and combination therapy
design for HCC [3].
Growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene 45
(GADD45) family proteins have been reported to play
essential roles in cellular stress response, survival,
senescence, and apoptosis regulation [7]. Both tumorpromoting and tumor-suppressing effects of GADD family
proteins have been reported, depending on the cell types
tested, the types of oncogenic stresses, and the interaction
with other cellular signaling pathways [7]. GADD45
family proteins are frequently underexpressed in various
types of cancers including HCC [8, 9]. The induction
of GADD45 expression in the liver may facilitate the
regulation of liver regeneration after hepatectomy or
chemically induced liver injury [10, 11]. The role of
GADD45 expression in hepatocarcinogenesis remains
undetermined.
GADD45 family proteins are also crucial
mediators of genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis and
transforming growth factor-β-induced apoptosis [12,
13]. Induction of GADD45 expression can enhance
the therapeutic efficacy of cytotoxic agents in cancer
cells [14, 15]. We previously reported that GADD45β
expression was induced in HCC cells after sorafenib
treatment, and this induction was an important
predictor of sorafenib sensitivity in HCC cells [16]. We
hypothesized that GADD45 family proteins may serve as
predictive biomarkers for efficacy of molecular targeted
therapy for HCC.
In the present study, we explored the biological
significance of GADD45γ expression in HCC tumor
tissues, and the potential predictive value of GADD45γ
induction in HCC cells on the efficacy of sorafenib
treatment. GADD45γ has been reported to be a tumor
suppressor in multiple cancer types, and it can induce
growth arrest and apoptosis in response to environmental
stress [17]. Furthermore, GADD45γ expression was
suppressed in HCC, but the clinical significance was
unclear [18]. The regulatory mechanisms of GADD45γ
expression in response to sorafenib treatment was also
explored.

Induction of GADD45γ expression in HCC cells
by sorafenib correlated with sorafenib efficacy

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In vitro studies on the effects of GADD45γ
expression on sorafenib-sensitive (Huh-7 and HepG2,
IC50 6–7 μM), acquired sorafenib-resistant (Huh-7R
and HepG2R, IC50 12–15 μM), and intrinsic sorafenibresistant (Hep3B, IC50 12 μM) HCC cells are summarized
in Figure 1. The baseline GADD45γ expression did
not vary signficantly between sorafenib-sensitive and
sorafenib-resistant HCC cells (Figure 1A). However,
GADD45γ induction was more prominent in sorafenibsensitive HCC cells than in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells
and was independent of the MEK/ERK signaling in HCC
cells because the RAF inhibitor, ZM336372, or the MEK
inhibitor, U0126, could not induce GADD45γ expression
(Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S1).
The suppression of GADD45γ expression by using
siRNA increased the resistance to sorafenib in sorafenibsensitive HCC cells; this was evident with the increased
IC50 and reduced sorafenib-induced apoptosis (Figure
1B and Supplementary Figure S2A). Overexpression
of GADD45γ in acquired sorafenib-resistant HCC cells
significantly enhanced the suppression of proliferation
and sorafenib-induced apoptosis (Figure 1C and
Supplementary Figure S2B).
In vivo studies determining the significance of
GADD45γ induction in sorafenib-induced apoptosis are
summarized in Figure 2. Sorafenib treatment (10 mg/kg/
day) inhibited tumor growth in Huh-7 but not in Huh7R xenografts (Figure 2A). Inhibition of tumor growth
in Huh-7 xenografts was associated with the induction
of GADD45γ expression, increased tumor cell apoptosis
(TUNEL assay), and reduced tumor angiogenesis
(microvessel density) (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure
S3A and S3C). GADD45γ overexpression in Huh-7R
xenografts, achieved using adenoviral transfer (Figure 2C),
did not demonstrate tumor-suppressing effects by itself.
However, significant sensitization of the Huh-7R xenograft
to sorafenib, increased tumor cell apoptosis (TUNEL
assay), and reduced tumor angiogenesis were observed
(Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure S3D and S3F). The
body weight of animals with or without sorafenib treatment
or GADD45γ overexpression did not vary significantly
(Supplementary Figure S3B and S3E). This indicated that
GADD45γ induction may act in a synthetic-lethal manner
to enhance the antitumor activity of sorafenib in HCC cells.

Survivin is a crucial downstream mediator
of GADD45γ induction to reverse sorafenib
resistance
To explain the antitumor enhancement between
GADD45γ induction and sorafenib, we assessed the molecules

that have been linked to sorafenib resistance, including
survivin, DR5/FADD (the TRAIL pathway), and Mcl-1, by
using Western blotting [19–21]. Survivin was selected as the
candidate mediator to explain the apoptosis-enhancing effects
of GADD45γ because the variation in survivin expression
was compatible with the enhanced antitumor efficacy between
sorafenib and GADD45γ induction (Figure 3A and 3B). The
baseline survivin expression did not vary signficantly between
sorafenib-sensitive and acquired sorafenib-resistant HCC
cells (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S4A). Survivin
overexpression reduced the apoptosis-inducing effects of
GADD45γ overexpression combined with sorafenib in
the sorafenib-sensitive and sorafenib-resistant HCC cells
(Figure 3C, Supplementary Figure S4A–S4C, and S5A).
However, suppression of survivin expression by using siRNA
knockdown further increased the apoptosis-inducing effects
between GADD45γ overexpression and sorafenib (Figure
3D and Supplementary Figure S5B). Mcl-1overexpression,
which has been reported as an essential mediator of antitumor
effects of sorafenib in HCC, resulted in a similar trend of

negating the enhancement between GADD45γ and sorafenib
(Supplementary Figure S6). The preceding data supports
the role of survivin as an important downstream mediator of
antitumor enhancement between GADD45γ overexpression
and sorafenib.

CCAAT/enhancer binding protein as a potential
regulator of GADD45γ induction by sorafenib
We initially analyzed luciferase reporter activities of
GADD45γ promoter plasmids (with serial deletions in the
5′-flanking region) because our data indicated that sorafenib
induced GADD45γ expression at the transcriptional level.
The region of -449/-82 in the 5′-flanking region was crucial
for GADD45γ induction by sorafenib (Figure 4A). Two
binding sites for the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein
(C/EBP) transcriptional factor were identified in this
region (-340/-330 and -103/-93) by using the TFSEARCH
program (Supplementary Figure S7). Reporters with
mutations at these C/EBP binding sites demonstrated no

GADD45γ expression in HCC tumors facilitated
the prediction of survival in patients with HCC
who had undergone curative surgery

to sorafenib. In addition, suppression of GADD45γ
expression in HCC tumor tissue was observed to be an
independent predictor of poor overall survival in patients
with HCC who had undergone curative surgery. The
results indicate that GADD45γ may act as a prognostic
factor and as a marker for response to sorafenib in HCC.
Regulation of GADD45 expression, which
involves complex interaction between cellular growth
control and stress response, has been extensively
studied [24, 25]. Although suppression of GADD45
expression in cancer cells is commonly noted, the clinical
significance is unclear. In this study we demonstrated
that GADD45γ expression was not associated with other
clinicopathological features of HCC, and the suppression
of GADD45γ expression was correlated with poor overall
survival in patients with HCC who had undergone curative
surgery. Our data suggest that GADD45 family proteins
may serve as tumor suppressors in carcinogenesis, which is
different from the survival-promoting effects of GADD45
in liver regeneration [26, 27]. Because GADD45 family
proteins may be regulated by similar cellular mechanisms,
it is of value to explore the potential interaction between
GADD45γ and other GADD45 family proteins in HCC
progression and their prognostic values [28].
Validation of the predictive value of GADD45γ
induction in response to sorafenib treatment is challenging.
In our studies, the difference in GADD45γ induction after
sorafenib treatment varied significantly between sorafenibsensitive and sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Therefore,
comparison of GADD45γ between pre- and posttreatment
tumor samples is essential to validate the concept. Tumor
specimens for biomarker analysis were difficult to obtain
because of the prevalent clinical diagnosis of HCC [1]. An
additional difficulty was obtaining pre- and posttreatment

GADD45γ mRNA was more suppressed in
HCC tumor tissue than in the adjacent nontumor liver
tissue, and the median T to non-T ratio of GADD45γ
mRNA was 33.8% (0.7%–974.0%) (Figure 5A). The
expression levels of GADD45γ did not correlate with any
clinicopathological factors, including age, sex, underlying
chronic viral hepatitis, presence of cirrhosis, tumor grade
and stage, serum α-fetoprotein levels, and the presence of
vascular invasion (Table 1). Univariate analysis revealed
that low GADD45γ expression was associated with short
overall survival (Figure 5B and Supplementary Table S2).
After controlling the potential confounding factors by
using multivariate analysis, low GADD45γ expression
became an independent predictor of poor overall survival,
in addition to age and the presence of vascular invasion
(Table 1). The hazard ratio of death was 2.94 (95% CI
1.27–6.77, p = 0.012) for patients with low GADD45γ
expression (tumor to nontumor ratio of < 33.8%). The
potential prognostic value of GADD45γ expression was
supported by data from the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal
(http://cbioportal.org) [22, 23], which revealed a consistent
trend of superior survival in patients with GADD45γ
overexpression (Supplementary Table S3).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that GADD45γ
expression in HCC cells was associated with the sorafenib
sensitivity of HCC cells. The induction of GADD45γ
expression can reverse the resistance of HCC cells

because the majority of patients have a high bleeding risk
due to the underlying cirrhosis. Development of novel and
noninvasive technology may help detect the molecular
changes after drug therapy and facilitate the validation of
predictive biomarkers for HCC [29, 30].
A major finding in this study is that while
GADD45γ overexpression alone had no evident effects on
growth or apoptosis induction in HCC cells, GADD45γ
overexpression can significantly reverse the resistance
of HCC cells to sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. This
finding is consistent with previous studies, which suggest
that GADD45γ can enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic
therapy and provide opportunities for synthetic lethalitybased development of new therapeutic targets [31].
The frequently reported downstream mediators of the
proapoptotic effects of GADD family proteins include
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stress-related mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 and
MKK4) and the proapoptotic proteins Bim and PUMA
[32, 33]. The possibility of using GADD45 expression
as a marker for drug screening should be explored.
A more comprehensive exploration of the signaling
network pertinent to the proapoptotic effects of GADD45γ
in HCC will facilitate identifying new druggable targets
for HCC treatment.
Our results indicate that survivin and Mcl-1
are possible downstream mediators of the antitumor
enhancement between GADD45γ and sorafenib. Survivin,
which facilitates the integration of the cellular signals
determining cellular proliferation, survival, and drug
resistance, has been reported as a key regulator of the
resistance of HCC cells to various molecular targeted
agents [21, 34–36]. GADD45γ may act as a transcriptional
coactivator or interact with other cellular signaling
27960

pathways, including cell cycle control and stress response,
to regulate cell survival. Therefore, it may inhibit
survivin expression through both transcriptional and
posttranslational mechanisms [37, 38]. On the other hand,
survivin expression is regulated by a complex intracellular
signaling network and sorafenib may inhibit survivin
expression through the downregulation of a mammalian
target of rapamycin activity, independent of GADD45γ
[39]. Mcl-1 is also a crucial antiapoptotic protein for
cell survival maintenance and drug resistance regulation
[40–42]. Therapeutic strategies targeting survivin or Mcl1 have been developed, and additional studies based on
these strategies alone or in combination with sorafenib in
patients with HCC are warranted [43, 44].
In this study, we demonstrated that the
transcriptional factor C/EBP-δ may increase the induction
of GADD45γ by sorafenib. Previous studies have
indicated that C/EBP-δ has contrasting effects at different
stages of carcinogenesis [45]. However, C/EBP-δ can
suppress tumor growth by inducing apoptosis, augmenting
DNA damage response, and inhibiting cell cycle
progression [46, 47]. Furthermore, C/EBP-δ can induce
lymphangiogenesis and tumor metastases in response to
hypoxia [48, 49]. GADD45γ can also be induced by other
transcriptional factors and by the methylation status of the
promoter region [50]. Cumulative evidence indicates that
GADD45 family proteins may facilitate the integration of
cellular response and environmental stress by interacting
with different signaling pathways [7]. An improved
understanding of the mechanisms regulating GADD45
family protein expression in HCC cells will facilitate
clarification on whether GADD45 family proteins are
suitable targets for new drug development for HCC.
In conclusion, our study indicates that GADD45γ
suppression is a poor prognostic factor in patients with
HCC. The induction of GADD45γ expression contributes
to sorafenib-induced apoptosis in HCC cells and may
serve as a biomarker for the development of new targeted
therapy for HCC.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s

for the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene were

as follows: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles
of 95°C for 15 s (denaturation), and 60°C for 1 min
(annealing and extension). The relative mRNA amount
of the target and control genes was calculated using the
ΔCt (threshold cycle) method. Relative expression = 2 −ΔCt,
where ΔCt = Ct (target gene) − Ct (control gene).

The GADD45γ, Mcl-1, and scrambled nonspecific
(negative control) siRNAs were purchased from Ambion
(Austin, TX, USA) (see Supplementary Table S1 for the
sequences). The si-survivin (catalog number L-00345900-0005) and scrambled nonspecific (negative control)
siRNA (catalog number D-001810-10-20) were purchased
from Thermo Scientific (Dharmacon Division) as
previously described [34]. siRNA were transfected using
the siPORT NeoFx siRNA transfection reagent (Ambion).
The transfected HCC cells were subsequently treated with
sorafenib (10 μM) for 48 hours and collected for subsequent
Western blot or quantitative reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Huh-7 cells (approximately 5 × 106) with or without
sorafenib treatment were used for ChIP, employing an EZChIP assay kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The PCR
amplification was performed using primers spanning the
CEBP sites on the GADD45γ promoter from nucleotides
-443 to -61 (see Supplementary Table S1 for sequences),
as described previously [16]. The band intensities were
quantified using AutoChemi imaging system (UVP,
Cambridge, UK), and signal intensities representing
DNA content were normalized to H2O. The conditions for
quantitative PCR were as follows: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C
for 10 min, 50 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, and 60°C for 1 min.
The relative DNA amount of the target and 0.1% input
GADD45γ was calculated using the ΔCt (threshold cycle)
method as previously described.

Cell culture
The HCC cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3B, were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and
the Huh-7 cell line was from the Health Science Research
Resources Bank. In this study Huh-7 and HepG2 cells
(sorafenib IC50 6–7 μM) were classified as sorafenibsensitive because previous pharmacokinetic studies have
determined the maximal plasma concentration of sorafenib
in patients treated by the recommended dosage by Food
Drug Administration (400 mg twice daily), was between
5 and 10 μM [51, 52]. Cell lines with acquired resistance
to sorafenib, Huh-7R and HepG2R, were generated
through continuous sorafenib treatment (up to 10 μM).

deviation (SD). Comparisons were analyzed using
the Student t test and one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Survival time for the human HCC tissue
studies was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method
and compared in different subgroups of patients by using
the log-rank test. The prognostic significance of individual
clinicopathological factors and GADD45γ expression
was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model.
Significance was defined as p < 0.05.

The protocol for the xenograft experiments was
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the College of Medicine, National Taiwan
University. The animal studies were performed according
to the criteria outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of
Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health.
Male BALB/c athymic (nu+/nu+) mice were inoculated
subcutaneously with Huh-7 cells or Huh-7R cells
(approximately 1 × 106). Huh-7R cells infected with the
Ad-GADD45γ or Ad-empty virus were used to determine
the effects of GADD45γ overexpression on treatment
efficacy. When the tumor volume reached approximately
100 mm3 (volume [mm3] = [width]2 × length × 0.5), the
mice were randomized to receive sorafenib (10 mg/kg/day)
or vehicle treatment (n ≥ 5 in each group). Drug treatments
were given daily by gavage. Tumor volume and body
weight were recorded every 5 days. Tumor samples, freshly
frozen after drug treatment, were collected to measure
the levels of pertinent mRNA and proteins by using realtime PCR and Western blot, respectively. The total RNA
was extracted from cells of tumor specimens, which
was collected using laser capture microdissection [15].
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor samples after
drug treatment were collected for immunohistochemical
analysis of pertinent protein expression and tumor
angiogenesis and TUNEL assay to measure tumor cell
apoptosis, as described previously [16].

Tumor specimens from patients with HCC

FINANCIAL SUPPORT

Total RNA was extracted from HCC tumors and
adjacent liver tissues, which were obtained from the tissue
bank of Taiwan Liver Cancer Network (TLCN). Eightytwo patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) stage I to IIIA disease who had undergone curative
surgery were included in this study. An informed consent
for tissue collection was obtained from each patient prior
to surgery. Data of clinicopathological features at surgery
and postoperational follow-up were provided by TLCN.
Recurrence-free survival time was calculated from the
date of surgery to the date of documented HCC tumor
recurrence, and overall survival time was calculated from
the date of surgery to the date of death or last follow-up.
The primers for the GADD45γ gene were purchased from
Applied Biosystems (ABI TaqMan assay Hs00198672_m1).
Quantification of GADD45γ expression was using the ΔCt
(threshold cycle) method described previously and expressed
as a tumor ΔCt/nontumor ΔCt (T/non-T) ratio.
