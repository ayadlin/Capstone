BACKGROUND: Hypericin is a potent inhibitor of glioma growth in vitro. To examine whether synthetic oral hypericin
can be tolerated by patients with recurrent malignant gliomas (anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma) and to
investigate its efficacy against these tumors, the authors undertook an open-label, sequential dose escalation/deescalation tolerance study. METHODS: Patients with documented recurrent or progressive malignant gliomas who
had received standard radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy were included. Patients were excluded for
previous treatment with agents known to contain hypericin or treatment within 30 days with medications known to
cause photosensitivity. Enrolled patients were given gradually increasing dosages of oral synthetic hypericin (0.050.50 mg/kg) for up to 3 months if no toxicity was observed, and patient response to treatment was noted. The
patients were examined each month and underwent magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate tumor status at 3
months. RESULTS: Synthetic hypericin administered orally appeared to provide stabilization or a slight (<50%)
decrease in tumor volume (coded as stable disease) at 3 months for 7 of 42 patients (17%) and produced a tumor
reduction >50% (partial response) in 2 patients (5%). Seventeen patients (40%) survived for 3 months on daily synthetic hypericin at dose levels of 0.33  0.070 mg/kg daily. The mean maximum tolerated dose was 0.40  0.098
mg/kg daily. Twelve patients continued on hypericin therapy beyond 3 months. The median survival was 26 weeks
(Kaplan-Meier method). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that synthetic, oral hypericin is well tolerated in this patient group. The response results were comparable to those reported from other studies of salvage

Hypericin is a natural compound found in the stems and petals of plants of the genus Hypericum, which includes the
common St. John’s wort plant, Hypericum perforatum. In contrast to the St. John’s wort plant extract of hypericin, which
contains a variety of chemical constituents, synthetic hypericin (used in the current trial), a polycyclic naphthodianthrone,
is synthesized chemically in 3 steps. Early clinical trials evaluated synthetic hypericin (VIMRxyn; Hy BioPharma, Jamison,
Pa) as an antiviral agent in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus1 and hepatitis C.2 In addition, synthetic hypericin is known as a potent protein kinase C inhibitor.3 To evaluate the potential of hypericin as an inhibitor of glioma
growth, previous investigations were conducted on glioma cells in vitro.3 It has been demonstrated that hypericin inhibits
glioma growth in a dose-related manner in vitro, with the marked inhibition of growth, motility, and invasion in the lowmicromolar concentration range.4 Because the reported inhibitory effects of protein kinase C are enhanced by visible light,
[3H]thymidine uptake has been measured in both the presence and the absence of visible light. In glioma line A172, the

presence of light slightly increased the inhibitory effect of
hypericin. Moreover, in an apoptosis assay to determine
whether the treatment of glioma cells with hypericin was
cytostatic or cytocidal, DNA from cells that were treated
with hypericin for 48 hours exhibited a classic ‘‘ladder’’
pattern of oligonucleosome-sized fragments characteristic
of apoptosis. These data suggest that hypericin may have
potential as an antiglioma agent.4
Studies on its mechanism of anticancer activity indicate that hypericin binds to heat shock protein 90 (Hsp
90), leading to its ubiquitinylation. This disrupts several
critical client proteins that regulate cell growth pathways,
resulting in destabilization, rapid degradation, and elimination from the cells of a variety of Hsp 90 client proteins,
ultimately leading to cell death.5 Additional research indicates that photoactivated hypericin possesses significant
antiproliferative effects on activated normal human
lymphoid cells and malignant T-cells purified from the
blood of patients with Sezary syndrome or the leukemic
phase of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The mechanism of
the antiproliferative activity may be related to the high
rate of apoptotic death in these lymphoid cells.6 Experiments have demonstrated that hypericin also has antiangiogenic activity in several rat ocular models.7 Because
hypericin has been used in clinical trials for other tumor
types,8-10 the objective of the current study was to determine the tolerability and any potential antitumor activity
of orally administered, synthetic hypericin in patients harboring malignant gliomas (anaplastic astrocytoma and
glioblastoma multiforme) that had recurred after standard
therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
To determine whether hypericin can be tolerated by
patients with recurrent malignant gliomas and to investigate its efficacy against these tumors, we undertook an
open-label, sequential dose escalation/de-escalation tolerance study in 42 patients (7 with anaplastic astrocytomas
and 35 with glioblastomas) who had a diagnosis of recurrent malignant glioma. The study was conducted between
1996 and 1998 at 6 clinical centers in the United States
and Canada (Westchester Medical Center, New York
Medical College, Valhalla, NY; Trinity Medical Center,
Minot, ND; Tom Baker Cancer Center, University of
Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; University of Washington, Seattle, Wash; University of Southern California
University Hospital, Los Angeles, Calif; and Walt Disney
Memorial Cancer Institute at Florida Hospital, Orlando,

Fla). The study proceeded sequentially in groups of 4
study participants, with each group receiving a step-wise
higher dosage of hypericin if the previous group experienced no severe phototoxicity (mild phototoxicity was
accepted) or other toxicities, including neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, or myelotoxicity, after 14 days.
Study participants were treated as outpatients. Each
patient returned to the clinic once daily during the initial
2 weeks or the first month (depending on dose escalation)
to receive the dose of hypericin and, when indicated, to
have a blood sample drawn. Thereafter, patients were provided their medication as a ‘‘mail prescription’’ prepared
by the hospital pharmacist assigned to the study. Unless
they were withdrawn early because of toxicity or intolerance (or lack of effectiveness indicated by clinical symptom progression or tumor progression on imaging), each
study participant continued in the study for 3 months of
hypericin treatment and remained under observation as
noted until the follow-up visit. Each patient underwent a
physical examination 4 times during the first month and
then once monthly in Months 2 and 3. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done for tumor evaluation at 3 months.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Men or nonpregnant women aged 18 years with documented (by MRI supported by biopsy or [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography screening)
recurrent or progressive malignant gliomas were considered for the study. All tumor pathology at initial or repeat
surgical resection was reviewed by a neuropathologist
(D.R.H.). Included patients had previously received
standard external-beam radiation therapy with or without
adjunctive chemotherapy, had a Karnofsky performance
status 70, had adequate baseline organ function documented by clinical laboratory testing, and had no evidence
of intercurrent illness.
Patients were excluded from the study if they had
received previous treatment at any time with agents
known to contain hypericin (eg, Hyperforate 500 mg,
Psychotonin M alcohol extract, St. John’s wort), treatment within 30 days before study entry with any medications known to cause phototoxicity or photosensitization,
or treatment within 2 weeks before study entry with any
investigational drug(s). Other exclusion criteria included
the presence of significant cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or central nervous system disorders; concurrent substance abuse; or generalized skin rash or other

disorders that potentially could interfere with the assessment of phototoxicity.
All patients were adequately informed of the nature
and risks of study and provided written informed consent
before the first study procedures. Institutional review
board approval was obtained at each of the treating sites.
Treatments Administered
Hypericin was administered as an oral solution at doses
ranging from 0.05 to 0.50 mg/kg once each morning for
up to 3 months. Patients in the first group (Group I, 4
patients) received an oral dose of 0.05 mg/kg hypericin
once daily for 14 days. Then, because no severe phototoxicity or other toxicity was observed at the initial dosage,
the Group I patients were given higher dose levels of the
drug. The next treatment group (Group II, 4 patients)
received 0.1 mg/kg daily as the first dose. Because little (if
any) phototoxicity or other toxicity was observed at that
dosage level, dose levels for these patients were escalated,
and all subsequent patients (Group III, 34 patients)
received 0.20 mg/kg daily as the initial dosage. In each
group, if no toxicity was observed after 14 days of dosing
at 1 level, then the dosages were increased step-wise from
0.25 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg, at the discretion of the investigators if the drug was tolerated. The sponsor was notified
of negative effects experienced by the patients. The investigators and the sponsor confirmed the dose escalation
and de-escalation. The dosing escalation criteria were
intended to avoid or minimize potential harm to the
patients.
Hypericin dosing was calculated according to body
weight. Patients were weighed within 48 hours before
administration of the first dose of study medication, and
that weight was used to calculate the dosage for the duration of the patient’s participation in the trial. The maximum tolerated effective dose was defined as the dose that
caused antiglioma activity with minimal phototoxicity or
other toxicities, including neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal
toxicity, or myelotoxicity.
The objective of the dose adjustment scheme was to
have a minimum of 16 total patients from any group complete 3 months of treatment at the maximum tolerated
dose. If severe phototoxicity or other grade III or greater
toxicities were observed at any dose level, then no further
dose increases were made. In the event that either of these
conditions was met, the next dose group received a dose
that was a half of the log10 dose lower than the dose that
produced toxicity. Whenever severe toxicity was observed
in a patient, that patient was discontinued from the study

Cancer

and/or the dosage was adjusted downward at the discretion of the physician (with the consent of the patient). In
the event that moderate (tolerable grade II) toxicity was
observed in any patient, dose de-escalation (a half-log10
dosage level) was undertaken in that patient. In all instances, the patients were monitored closely for latent toxicity.
If patients developed mild, moderate, or severe phototoxicity, then a dermatologist was consulted on the same day,
and appropriate photographs were taken of the affected
skin with the patient number and day of treatment
recorded.
Stock solutions of chemically synthesized hypericin
(not the plant extract) were prepared from hypericin powder by VimRx Pharmaceuticals (Wilmington, Del; data
on file at Hy BioPharma Inc.). All dosage preparation
steps were documented by the study personnel, and
appropriate quality-assurance measures were applied to
assure the accuracy of the dosage calculations, weighing of
drug, dilutions, and other dosage preparation steps.
Drug Concentration Measurements and
Pharmacokinetics
Blood was drawn for pharmacokinetic analyses into heparinized tubes at predetermined times of 0 hours and 6
hours (1 day weekly) during Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3; an additional set of blood samples was obtained in Week 12 at 0
hours, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, 24
hours, and, in 2 cases, 48 hours. The plasma was centrifuged at 1000g for 10 minutes, aliquoted into cryovials,
stored at 20 C, and shipped in batches on dry ice to the
Clinical Core Laboratory at New York University Medical
Center.
Hypericin-spiked standard solutions were prepared
from a 2-mg/mL stock in ethanol to working dilution of 1
lg/mL. Aliquots of these working standards were used to
provide plasma standards in the range from 20 ng/mL to
1280 ng/mL as well as precision samples in low, medium,
and high range values of the standard curve (40 ng/mL,
120 ng/mL, and 640 ng/mL). Aliquots of 0.5 mL were
removed into 12  75-mm glass centrifuge tubes and
stored frozen at 20 C until they were used. For a given
assay, a 6-point standard curve with each concentration
extracted in duplicate was used along with triplicate samples of the 3 precision standards.
Each plasma sample was analyzed twice at 590 nM
using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method previously described11 with the following
modifications: Two 0.5-mL aliquots of the plasma sample
were processed through 2 consecutive extraction cycles

with 0.125 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide. This was followed
by the addition of 0.625 mL of a mixture consisting of
acetonitrile/2-butoxyethanol, 90/10 (volume/volume), to
the samples, which were then centrifuged. Supernatant
was collected and transferred to a 2-mL volumetric flask;
then, the volume was brought up to 2.0 mL.
Pharmacokinetic analyses of plasma levels were
undertaken using WinNonLin Pro Node (version 3.3;
Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, Calif), and the dose
proportionality of minimal plasma concentration (Cmin)
and maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) values were
assessed by regression analyses using Sigma Plot (version
8.0.2; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).
Statistical Analysis
A Kaplan-Meier test was used to determine the median
survival of all patients in the intent-to-treat population.
Survival was calculated from the first day of hypericin dosing to the date of death for 9 patients who were uncensored. For 33 patients who were censored, survival was
calculated conservatively from the first day of dosing to
the last available date patients were known to be alive,
which was the date they received their last dose of
medication.

and Cmax, which clearly indicate dose proportionality (P

indicated correlations (r2) of 0.95 and 0.83 for Cmin and
Cmax, respectively.
Figure 2 illustrates mean and log plasma profiles of
hypericin levels in patients who received a mean dose of
0.40  0.07 mg/kg. By using a ‘‘2-compartment openmodel’’ with first-order absorption and elimination rates,
a correlation coefficient r2 ¼ 0.941 was achieved. At
steady state, a long half-life was manifested with both the
mean and the geometric mean levels.

plasma levels in 6 patients. It is noteworthy that a long
half-life of 68.6 to 72.1 hours was observed at steady state,
and apparent extensive tissue distribution was observed

kinetic model. Also noteworthy were the magnitude of
rate constants K12 versus K21, which indicate that the rate
of distribution of hypericin into the tissue compartment
was >2-fold that of the distribution back into the ‘‘plasma
compartment.’’ These findings strongly suggest that hypericin is distributed rapidly into the intracellular tissue
compartment, where it behaves as a ‘‘tissue reservoir.’’
Tolerability
In total, 17 patients completed a 3-month treatment regimen, and 12 patients elected to continue therapy under a
compassionate-use exemption. For the latter patients,
daily hypericin at levels were 0.33  0.070 mg/kg. The
mean maximum tolerated dose was 0.40  0.098 mg/kg
daily.
Adverse Events
Toxicity was graded in the standard manner using
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.12
Of 42 patients who were enrolled in the intent-to-treat
cohort, 31 patients (73.8%) experienced adverse events
attributed to study medication. According to what might
be expected from the pharmacology of hypericin, the
body system/organ class with the highest incidence of
adverse events attributed to study medication was skin
and subcutaneous tissue disorders (30 of 42 patients;
71.4%), including photosensitivity reaction (18 of 42

patients; 42.9%), erythema (11 of 42 patients; 26.2%),
and skin burning sensation (6 of 42 patients; 14.3%). No
patient had a severe enough adverse effect from skin reaction that hospitalization was indicated. Nervous system
disorders (35 of 42 patients) included convulsions, hyperesthesia, and parasthesia, although the cause of these disorders most likely was disease progression rather than
study medication. Finally, gastrointestinal side effects,
including abdominal distension, vomiting, and diarrhea,
occurred in 10 of 42 patients (23.8%). No myelotoxicity
occurred during treatment with hypericin, although 1
patient had a mild case of thrombocytopenia. No significant alopecia occurred in any of the patients; 1 patient
had alopecia listed as an adverse event.
Response to Treatment and Survival
Twenty percent of patients with glioblastoma multiforme
responded to the treatment, and 29% of patients with
anaplastic astrocytoma responded (Table 3). For the 25
patients who failed to respond during the initial 3
months, the dose level ranged from 0.20 to 0.50 mg/kg,
and 60% of those patients received doses 0.40 mg/kg.
All of these patients failed within 30 to 60 days of initiating hypericin treatment. Among the patients who failed
to complete 3 months of treatment, none demonstrated
stable disease or partial response. For the patients who did
complete 3 months of treatment, final dose and response
data are listed in Table 4.
For purposes of efficacy analysis, patients were divided into 3 populations based on their length of treatment, as presented in Table 5. No patient had a complete
response to treatment. Twenty-two percent of patients (9
of 42) in the intent-to-treat population achieved either
stable disease (17%; 7 patients) or a partial response (5%;
2 patients) during hypericin treatment. The objective of
the study was for at least 16 patients to complete treatment with hypericin for 3 months (per protocol population). Of the 17 patients who completed 3 months of

treatment with hypericin, 53% (9 of 17 patients) achieved
either stable disease (41%; 7 patients) or a partial response
(12%; 2 patients). One additional patient completed at
least 2 months of treatment. Thus, for the 18 patients
who completed >60 days of treatment, 50% achieved either stable disease (39%) or a partial response (11%), similar to what was achieved by patients who successfully
completed only 3 months of treatment.
Of the 42 patients who were enrolled, 17 patients
(40%) survived to 3 months after enrollment. The median
survival for all patients in the intent-to-treat analysis, as
determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, independent of
their response to treatment, was 26 weeks (Fig. 3). In
addition, 8 of 42 patients survived beyond 6 months
(mean survival, 20.8  11.35 months). Further analysis
indicated that the mean progression-free survival of all
patients in the intent-to-treat group was 20 weeks (Fig. 4).
Partial radiographic reduction in tumor size (>50%
but <100%) was observed in 2 patients who had received
hypericin for >3 months. Both of those patients had
recurrent disease, 1 with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma
and the other with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
Figure 5 illustrates the response obtained in the patient
who had a recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma along with
the documented radiographic reduction in tumor size.

For a patient to be evaluable and allowed to continue in the study, the patient must have received a minimum of 5 consecutive doses in the first week and
must have missed only 1 dose per week in the first 2 weeks of therapy. Beyond Day 14, the patient, although deemed evaluable, would be allowed to continue
provided they did not skip more than 2 consecutive doses in any given week and a total of 4 skipped days in the 3-month treatment period.

Figure 3. This Kaplan-Meier plot illustrates the median survival of patients with glioma in the intent-to treat population. The median survival was 26 weeks.

That patient was stable at last follow-up (36 months posttreatment). The other patient, who had a recurrent glioblastoma, had undergone repeat craniotomy, resulting in
postoperative bone flap infection, necessitating its removal. This patient underwent hypericin treatment and
achieved a partial radiographic reduction in tumor
volume.

DISCUSSION
The prognosis for patients with malignant gliomas
remains poor despite advances in surgery, radiation, and
chemotherapy. The rationale for postulating an antitumor
effect for hypericin originally related to its ability to inCancer

hibit protein kinase C, an enzyme that has been demonstrated to correlate with glioma cell growth in vitro.3,13,14
However, other antitumor mechanisms, including ubiquitinylation of Hsp 90 and mediation by an O2-dependent degradation domain through the ubiquitinproteasome pathway, also probably are involved.5,15
Hypericin readily crosses the blood-brain barrier
and may be administered parenterally or orally.16 Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that hypericin has
a long half-life at steady state with extensive intracellular
tissue distribution. Quantifiable levels of hypericin have
been documented in the glioma tissue of a patient with
recurrent glioblastoma multiforme who underwent repeat
surgery and previously had received hypericin.

patient still was alive and functional.

tumor extractions and were measured in the range from

for patients with recurrent gliomas. Twelve patients in
our study continued on hypericin therapy beyond 3
months. These results indicate that hypericin is well tolerated orally in this patient group. The dose-limiting toxicity in these patients was photosensitivity. No significant
myelotoxicity or alopecia was observed in these patients.
The response results from this study are comparable
to those from other published studies on salvage therapies
for recurrent malignant brain gliomas that have been suggested as promising. Treatment with temozolomide for
recurrent glioblastoma using the standard 3-week-on and
1-week-off regimen in 33 patients with chemotherapy-naı̈ve, recurrent glioblastoma resulted in a 6-month progression-free survival rate of 30.3% and an overall response
rate of 9%.17 Implantation of Gliadel wafers (carmustine)
placed surgically for the treatment of recurrent malignant
gliomas resulted in an overall median survival of 46 weeks
after placement.18 Bevacizumab, the latest addition to the
US Food and Drug Administration-approved armamentarium for recurrent malignant gliomas, improved the 6month progression-free survival rate to 42.6% of patients
who received bevacizumab alone.19 In our study, hypericin administered orally appeared to provide stabilization
and even produced a slight (<50%) decrease in tumor
volume (coded as stable disease) at 3 months for 7 of 42
enrolled patients (17%) and a tumor reduction >50%
(but <100%), which was coded as a partial response, for
an additional 2 patients. Forty percent of the patients enrolled in our study survived to 3 months after enrollment
on daily hypericin. Eight of 42 patients (19%) survived
beyond 6 months (mean survival, 20.8 months).
When the treatment effect of hypericin was examined for each tumor type independently (Table 3),
because of the small sample size, hypericin did not demonstrate a significant treatment effect for recurrent
anaplastic astrocytoma. When combined with the glioblastoma response data, however, the astrocytoma data
were suggestive of a treatment effect on astrocytoma as
well. A larger sample size will be required to further evaluate the response to hypericin in patients with recurrent
gliomas.
There are several potential reasons for the discrepancy in overall survival for these patients. First, in the current study, there were no exclusion criteria based on
tumor size. Many of our patients had tumors as large as 4
 4  4 cm, often with adjacent mass effect, yet these
patients often had Karnofsky scores that were better than
would be expected from tumors of that size. Because hypericin is administered orally with the goal of inhibiting

protein kinase C, the time that was required for hypericin
to be effective may not have be long enough for the drug
to have an effect in some patients who had larger tumors.
Future trials will need to include tumor size as an exclusion criterion to control for the effect of slower drug
response. Finally, the effect of photosensitivity experienced by patients may be a potential attribute of longterm effects. For example, 1 patient who had an enduring
effect from hypericin had undergone previous bone flap
removal secondary to an infection. The possibility of hypericin photosensitization of the tumor bed to increase activity should be investigated further.
Since this hypericin study was performed, additional
protein kinase C inhibitors have come up for clinical trial;
however, to date, their use has not been without concern.
Enzastaurin is a protein kinase Cb selective inhibitor that
has been used in investigational studies for a wide range of
cancers, including gliomas, lung cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.20 In a phase 1 trial in patients with recurrent gliomas, Kreisl et al21 reported that increasing the
dosing of enzastaurin from daily to twice daily dosing
resulted in improved drug exposure but with unacceptable
toxicities of thrombocytopenia and prolonged QTc at
dose-limiting toxicities. These toxicities were not observed
at the dose-limiting toxicity for hypericin. Bryostatin 1 is
a protein kinase C partial agonist that reportedly has both
antineoplastic and immune-stimulatory properties. In a
phase 2 study in patients with recurrent metastatic melanoma, the major toxicity of this treatment was myalgia,
but investigators reported that bryostatin 1 was not an
effective treatment in these patients.22
The future of hypericin in the treatment of malignant gliomas most likely will focus on 4 potential areas of
treatment: 1) first-line therapy in conjunction with temozolomide and radiation therapy; 2) combination therapy
with other chemotherapeutic agents, including bevacizumab, irinotecan, and temozolomide; 3) use in temozolomide-resistant patients; and 4) local intratumoral
application. First-line therapy with hypericin in conjunction with temozolomide and radiation therapy in newly
diagnosed patients with malignant gliomas has the merit
that hypericin has been established as a good radiation
sensitizer and has an additive/synergistic effect with temozolomide in in vitro and in vivo models.23,24 This combination model will optimize the chemotherapeutic and
radiation-sensitizing model of hypericin. Hypericin also
may be used as combination therapy with other chemotherapeutic agents like temozolomide instead of temozolomide alone, which is used currently after radiation

therapy. Moreover, hypericin may be used in combination with drugs like irinotecan.25 The use of hypericin in
salvage therapy for temozolomide-resistant patients is a
possibility, and in vitro and in vivo experiments are pending to evaluate this application. Hypericin also reportedly
has antiangiogenesis effects. Its use as an adjunct or in
place of bevacizumab for temozolomide-resistant patients
will need to be evaluated in the future.7 Finally, the use of
hypericin for local photodynamic therapy of the tumor
bed has been evaluated by other investigators for other
cancers, including esophageal, nasopharyngeal, and bladder malignancies.26,27 Whether it may be used as a local
photodynamic agent for the treatment of malignant gliomas will need to be evaluated in the future.
In conclusion, the results from this phase 1/2 trial of
orally administered, synthetic hypericin in patients with
recurrent malignant gliomas indicate that it is well tolerated and exhibits modest efficacy in this patient group.
Further trials of hypericin as adjuvant therapy for patients
with malignant glioma are warranted.
