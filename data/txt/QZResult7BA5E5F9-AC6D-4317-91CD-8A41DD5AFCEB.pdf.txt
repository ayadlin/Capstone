BACKGROUND. In adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, treatment results generally
are expressed in terms of overall survival or disease-free survival at 3 years. In
this investigation, the authors attempted to express the results in terms of the
proportion of long-term disease-free survivors and in terms of lifetime in patients
who developed recurrent disease or died.

METHODS. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the influence
of different covariates on the 2 result criteria in 922 participants in the Adult
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-94 multicenter trial.

55 years (11.4%; 95% CI, 7–17.9%) and in patients with the t(9;22) BCR-ABL
karyotype (13.4%; 95% CI, 8.8–19.8%), and the highest proportion was observed
in patients with the t(4;11) MLL-AF4 karyotype (31.3%; 95% CI, 18.2–48.3%). The
mean expected lifetime of patients who were not cured was 11.4 months (95%
CI, 9.1–14.1 months). It was longer in men than in women and was shorter with
increasing age, performance status, hemoglobin level, and white blood cell
count.

uring the past decades, a better knowledge of several biologic
aspects and the development of new therapeutic strategies and
more adapted supportive care have greatly improved the prognosis
for adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thus, to
some extent, the severity of the disease is being counterbalanced by
increased chances of a cure. Nevertheless, the cure rates, which
currently reach 75% in children,1–3 remain as low as 20% to 40% in
adults.3,4
‘‘Shall I be cured?’’ and, ‘‘if not, how long shall I live?’’ are the
patient’s main interrogations. These 2 questions express precisely
the 2 major issues in cancer, cure and survival, and the physicians’
answers generally are based on the rates of complete remission (CR)
and on the probability that patients will survive at 3 years or 5 years
after diagnosis. Currently, in ALL, CR rates in adults range from 75%

to 93%, and the overall 5-year survival rate ranges
from 28% to 48%.5
In patients ALL, the assumption that a group will
be cured and survive while the other will die from
the disease is accepted widely in children but still is
discussed in adults. In adult ALL, previous studies
generally failed to determine who will recover and
who will not, and most stayed focused on survival
rates and relative risks of death. Those indicators are
essential when the disease is always fatal, but they
are inappropriate when a large number of patients
are cured. Therefore, it is important to distinguish 2
subpopulations of patients: 1) cured patients (ie,
long-term event-free survivors3 [LTEFS]), who are
censored on the extended final plateau of ALL survival curves; and 2) patients who will die from ALL
either because of resistance to the induction treatment or because of disease recurrence. Thus, the first
search for the factors that predict the proportion of
LTEFS should answer the question, ‘‘Who will be
cured?’’ Then, another search for the disease-related
prognostic factors that modify lifetime would respond
to the question, ‘‘How long will I live?’’ Overall, the
subsets of predictors relative to the 2 subpopulations
or the 2 questions may be similar or different, and
the common factors that predict death or survival
may result from 2 different types of analysis.
Between June 1994 and January 2002, 922
patients ages 15 years to 55 years (median age, 33
years) entered the Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-94 (LALA-94) multicenter trial and received a
standard 4-drug/4-week induction course, eventually
followed by salvage therapy, which consisted of an
intensive course of mitoxantrone plus intermediatedose cytarabine, and then a risk-adapted postremission therapy. Overall, 771 patients achieved a CR
(84%). The median overall survival (OS) was 23
months with a 3-year OS rate of 39% and a 5-year
OS rate of 33%. The median disease-free survival
(DFS) was 17.5 months with a 3-year DFS rate of
37% and a 5-year DFS rate of 30%.6
The current report presents a new analysis of this
large trial that involved adult patients who were diagnosed with ALL after a long follow-up. Using a mixture
model, the analysis determined the proportion of
LTFDS along with the covariates that predicted this
outcome. The analysis also used the covariates that
influenced survival to determine the length diseasefree lifetime in patients who were not cured.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The LALA-94 trial was carried out from June 1984 to
January 2002. This multicenter study enrolled 922

2059

patients ages 15 years to 55 years with newly diagnosed, previously untreated ALL.
The diagnosis of ALL was established on morphologic and cytochemical examination of a bone
marrow aspirate. Patients with the French-AmericanBritish L3 subtype were excluded.7 After induction
therapy, 771 patients (83.6%) reached CR, which was
established on morphologic examination of bone
marrow aspirates that showed <5% leukemic blasts.
Cytogenetic analysis was performed systematically,
and immunophenotyping was performed in 99% of
patients. Molecular biology was performed during
the study period. The details regarding different procedures have been published previously.6 The study
protocol was approved by the institutional ethics
committee, and all patients provided informed consent before they entered the study.

Risk Groups and Treatments
In the current study, we considered 4 risk groups.
Group 1, the standard-risk group, included only
patients who achieved CR after 1 course of chemotherapy. These patients had had T-cell or B-cell
ALL (CD10-positive/CD19-positive or CD19-positive/
CD20-positive with no positive myeloid markers)
without central nervous system (CNS) involvement;
without t(9;22), t(1;19), t(4;11), or cytogenetic abnormalities with 11q23 rearrangement; and with a
white blood cell (WBC) count <30 3 109/L at diagnosis. Group 2, the first high-risk group, included
patients who were ineligible for Group 1 and who
had a Philadelphia chromosome-positive cytogenetic
pattern (Ph1) or CNS involvement. Group 3, the
second high-risk group, included patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive and/or BCR-ABL-positive patterns. Group 4, the third high-risk group,
included patients who had evidence of CNS leukemia
at diagnosis.
First, all patients received 4-week/4-drug induction therapy with cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2 per
day on Days 1 and 8), vincristine (2 mg per day on
Days 1, 8, 15, and 22), prednisone (60 mg/m2 per
day on Days 1–7 and Days 15–21), and either idarubicin (9 mg/m2 per day on Days 1, 2, 3, and 8) or
daunorubicin (30 mg/m2 per day on Days 1, 2, 3, 15,
and 16) based on the first randomization. The response was assessed on Day 28 after the start of
induction therapy.
The subsequent treatment was adapted to the
risk group. On Day 35, patients in Group 1 randomly
received either intensive consolidation chemotherapy
(mitoxantrone and intermediate-dose cytarabine)
or less intensive chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide,
cytarabine, and mercaptopurine). These courses were

2060

backed by a maintenance chemotherapy regimen for
2 years. High-risk patients (Groups 2, 3, and 4)
received intensive chemotherapy as described above.
Those who did not achieve CR after this course were
excluded from the protocol.
Group 2 patients ages 15 years to 50 years who
had a human leukemic antigen (HLA)-matched
sibling donor underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) after standard conditioning (cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg per day for 2 days and
fractionated total body irradiation with 10 grays [Gy]
to 12 Gy). Group 2 patients ages 15 years to 50 years
without an HLA-matched sibling donor or aged 50
years were randomized either to undergo autologous
SCT after standard conditioning or to receive maintenance chemotherapy for 26 months.
Group 3 and 4 patients who found an HLAmatched sibling donor underwent allogeneic SCT.
The other patients underwent autologous SCT.
Matched or mismatched, unrelated donors were
accepted for allogeneic SCT in Group 3. Prior to
transplantation, patients received 1 or 2 courses of
L-asparaginase plus methotrexate. Immunosuppressive therapy varied according to the policy of each
center.6

Outcome
Event-free survival was calculated from the date of
diagnosis to the date of death or recurrence. The
cut-off date was January 1, 2004. The mean followup of LTEFS was 55 months (4.6 years) and was >35
months in 75% of patients.
Studied Factors
The covariates that we studied for their influence on
the proportion of LTEFS and on the lifetime of
patients who were not cured were sex, age, World
Health Organization performance status index (PSI),
creatinine level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level,
hematologic parameters collected at diagnosis (hemoglobin, WBC count, platelet count), CNS involvement, and immunophenotype and karyotype analyses
made at diagnosis. Analysis was performed for each
sex, for each PSI (patients with a PSI from 2 to 4
were grouped into 1 category), presence/absence of
CNS involvement, immunophenotype, and karyotype. For continuous variables, the analysis was
performed with covariates split into 3 categories
using the first and third quartiles.
Categorical covariates were analyzed using a disjunctive coding that allowed a 1-to-1 comparison
with an a priori-defined reference category. PSI was
divided into 3 categories with PSI ¼ 0 as the reference category to be compared with the categories

PSI ¼ 1 and PSI > 1. Karyotypic analysis considered
normal cytogenetics as the reference category. The
other cytogenetic groups were the t(9;22) and/or
BCR-ABL group, the t(4;11) and/or MLL-AF4 group,
the t(1;19) and/or E2A-PBX1 group, and a miscellaneous group of patients who had 1 other anomalies
detected.

Statistical Methods
In the literature, the statistical models used for
survival analysis are mainly the Cox proportional
hazards model8 and, less often, the accelerated failure time model.9 Both models share the fundamental
assumption that all patients belong to a single population that either will develop recurrent disease or
will die of the disease. From a clinical point of view,
this assumption means that most treatments generally are worthless. Thus, a better approach to the real
situation of patients with leukemia would consider 2
different subpopulations: cured patients who will
survive free from the disease (ie, LTEFS) and patients
who either will develop recurrent disease or will die
from the disease (leukemia progression or treatment
toxicity).
Statistical analyses of these 2 subpopulations
were performed using a mixture model that originally
was developed by Peng et al.10 This model estimates
the cure rates by using logistic regression and estimates the survival of patients not cured—assuming
that cured patients will not die or develop recurrent
disease—using an accelerated failure time model.
Thus, the effect of cure predictors was expressed as
the odds ratio, and the expected survival of patients
not cured was estimated in several subgroups of the
main predictors.
The use of a survival model is subject to the
distribution assumptions, so that departures from
these assumptions may lead to wrong conclusions.
For an optimal handling of this problem, in our mixture model, we used a generalized F distribution
with flexible distribution that included the lognormal, exponential, Weibull, and log-logistic distributions. During a preliminary analysis, the log-normal distribution proved to be the most relevant and,
thus, was used for the final analysis. The proportion
of long-term disease-free survivors and the survival
distributions were subjected to modeling. The relevance of the mixture model according to different
distributions was examined by plotting the real survival curves (using the Kaplan-Meier method) along
with the estimated survival curves (with the mixture
model). Time was plotted on a log scale, because
most of events occur generally during the first

Prognostic Factors in Adult ALL/Le et al.

12 months. Survival was calculated from the time of
diagnosis to the time of recurrence or death.
Finally, a multivariate analysis was performed
taking into account both the proportion of long-term
disease-free survivors and the mean survival. This
multivariate analysis yielded the odds ratios of being
not cured and the change in expected survival in several subgroups of patients not cured. Graphs were
drawn to illustrate the expected lifetime of patients
not cured according to age, creatinine, LDH, WBC
count, platelet count, and hemoglobin. The analyses
were performed using S Plus 2000 software (Insightful Inc.), especially the ‘‘gfcure’’ library.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The LALA-94 protocol included 922 patients. Among
these, 643 patients developed recurrent disease or
died at the cut-off date. Patient characteristics are
shown in Table 1. The sex ratio was 1.83. Twenty-five
percent of patients were aged <23 years, 25% were
aged >44 years, and the median age at diagnosis was
33 years. Nearly 50% of patients had a PSI ¼ 1. CNS
involvement was found in 6.7% of patients, and
B-lineage leukemia affected nearly 70% of them.

Proportion of Long-term Survivors and Survival
CR was reached by 771 patients (83.6%). Event-free
survival (no death or recurrence) was reached by
29.3% of patients (95% confidence interval [95% CI],
26.3–32.5%) at 5 years after diagnosis and by 27.2%
of patients (95% CI, 23.7–31.1%) at 10 years after diagnosis. The OS rates were 32.7% (95% CI, 29.6–
36.1%) and 28.4% (95% CI, 25.1–32.3%), respectively,
at 5 years and 10 years after diagnosis.
Figure 1 shows OS according to the important
prognostic factors: For patients with Ph1 ALL versus
patients with non-Ph1 ALL, the OS rates were 17.8%;
(95% CI, 12.7–24.8%) at 5 years and 15.2% (95% CI,
10.2–22.7%) at 10 years versus 35.4% (95% CI, 31.4–
40%) and 31.2% (95% CI, 26.9–36.2%), respectively.
For patients who had initial WBC counts 30 3 109/L
versus patients who had initial WBC counts
<30 3 109/L, the OS rates were 28.0% (95% CI, 23.4–
33.5%) at 5 years and 23.1% (95% CI, 18.1–29.4%) at
10 years versus 35.5% (95% CI, 31.6–40%) and 31.8%
(95% CI, 27.5–36.7%), respectively. For patients who
required >1 treatment course to achieve CR versus
patients who required only 1 treatment course to
achieve CR, the OS rates were 23.9% (95% CI, 16.6–
34.2%) at 5 years and 20.3% (95% CI, 13.3–31.1%) at
10 years versus 39.6% (95% CI, 35.8–43.8%) and

patients aged 35 years versus patients aged <35
years, the OS rates were 24.3% (95% CI, 20.1–29.4%)
at 5 years and 19.9% (95% CI, 15.4–25.6%) at 10 years

Figure 2 shows a good fit between the real
survival curve and the model survival curve. The proportion of LTEFS was 21.5% (95% CI: 18.1–25.4%) of
the whole population, and the mean expected survival for patients not cured was 11.4 months (95%
CI, 9.1–14.1 months).
The proportion of LTEFS was greater among
women than among men, but the mean lifetimes of
women and men not cured were rather close (Table
2). The proportions of LTEFS were lower and lifetimes were shorter with increasing age (Fig. 3) and
increasing WBC count (Fig. 4), but they did not differ
significantly between patients with T-cell ALL and

patients with B-cell ALL. Finally, a proportion of
LTEFS and a short mean lifetime were observed in
patients not cured with the t(9;22)/BCR-ABL karyotype. Patients with the t(4;11)/MLL-AF4 karyotype
had the highest proportion of LTEFS but the shortest
mean survival (Fig. 5).

Independent Predictors of the Proportion
of LTEFS and of Lifetime
The proportions of LTEFS were influenced significantly by karyotype: Patients with the t(4;11)/MLLAF4 or the t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 karyotype had nearly

the same chance of a cure as patients with the
normal karyotype; however, patients with the Philadelphia karyotype—t(9;22)/BCR-ABL—or in the
‘‘miscellaneous’’ group had 6 times and 2 times less
chance of achieving a cure, respectively (Table 3).
Finally, LDH was the only other covariate that influenced the proportion of LTEFS: High LDH levels
were associated with a low proportion of LTEFS.
In patients not cured, the lifetime also was influenced significantly by 1) age (lifetimes were shorter
with older age), 2) general condition (patients with a
PSI  1 had shorter lifetimes than patients a PSI
of 0), 3) hemoglobin level (lifetimes were shorter as
hemoglobin levels increased), 4) WBC count (lifetimes were shorter as WBC counts increased), 5)
platelet count (lifetimes were longer as platelet
counts decreased), and 6) CNS involvement (lifetimes
were shorter for patients with CNS involvement). The
karyotype group did not show a significant influence
on lifetime.

DISCUSSION
The LALA-94 multicenter trial included patients ages
15 years to 55 years (median age, 33 years). All
patients received a standard 4-drug/4-week induction course with or without salvage/consolidation
therapy, which consisted of an intensive course
of mitoxantrone plus intermediate-dose cytarabine.
Then, patients followed a risk-adapted postremission
therapeutic strategy that consisted of either consolidation/maintenance chemotherapy for 2 years or

allogeneic or autologous SCT. CR was achieved in
84% of patients. The median OS was 23 months, the
3-year OS rate was 39%, and the 5-year OS rate was
33%. The median DFS was 17.5 months, the 3-year
DFS rate was 37%, and the 5-year DFS rate was 30%.6
These results were in the range of those published by
most large cooperative groups (Table 4).4,11–15
Many pretreatment variables have been identified that have prognostic value in ALL; however, in
recent adult ALL studies with intensive regimens,
only a few risk factors have emerged. Unsurprisingly,
in our study, the most important independent covariate that influenced the proportion of long-term survivors was the karyotype: The t(9;22)/BCR-ABL group
and the miscellaneous group had low proportions of

long-term survivors. Although it may be noteworthy,
this result should be considered with caution, first
because the development and extensive use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib mesylate,16 in
Ph1 ALL are promising and soon may change that
result; and, second, because the miscellaneous group
is quite heterogeneous and includes >100 different
chromosomal abnormalities. The finding that the
proportions of long-term survivors in the t(4;11)/
MLL-AF4 group and in the t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 were
similar to the proportions of long-term survivors in
the patients with the normal karyotype raises many
questions, because it was reported previously that
those groups had poor outcomes.17,18 These translocations are found in approximately 10% of adult
patients and represent the second most frequent
structural cytogenetic abnormalities of adult ALL.
Recent pediatric studies have indicated that the use

2064

CANCER

of an intensive chemotherapy regimen was able to
overcome the poor outcome of these patients, raising
the issue of allogeneic SCT in first CR. The use of
molecular diagnostic techniques contributed to a
more exhaustive identification of patients with fusion
transcripts, including t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 or t(4;11)/
MLL-AF4.6 The risk-adapted therapy applied to the
patients of these groups in the LALA-94 protocol—
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation performed
in first CR whenever possible—may explain these

good results and confirm that allogeneic SCT must
be offered to these patients in first CR.19 This suggests the feasibility of using matched, unrelated donor SCT in future clinical trials for patients without a
sibling donor.
Compared with previous studies,11,12,20,21 we did
not observe any difference in terms of outcome
between patients with T-cell lineage ALL and patients
with non-Ph1 B-cell lineage ALL. The omission of
asparaginase for induction and consolidation in the
LALA-94 regimen and its relation to the prognosis for
patients with T-cell lineage ALL should be considered. Results in T-lineage ALL were disappointing
compared with the LALA-87 trial,22 in which the
consolidation phase consisted of 3 1-month courses
that included asparaginase combined with cytarabine
and the same anthracycline administered during
induction therapy. In studies from other groups,20,21
the improved outcome of patients with T-cell ALL
was attributed to cyclophosphamide and cytarabine
pulses. However, the hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone
(hyper-CVAD)
regimen
included
both
fractionated cyclophosphamide and cytarabine23 but
produced a 3-year survival rate lower than that
observed in Cancer and Leukemia Group B Study
8811.20 Asparaginase also was omitted in a trial that
addressed the importance of the drug during the
induction/consolidation phase.23

The influence of LDH level is more classic,
because it usually reflects the tumor burden. However, LDH, as a prognostic factor, is more relevant in
aggressive lymphomas than in ALL.
The influence of covariates other than LDH and
karyotype also was questionable when the usual
prognostic factors11,20,21 identified by the multivariate analyses specifically influenced lifetime but not
the proportion of long-term survivors. Age, general
condition, WBC count, hemoglobin level, and platelet
count had an impact on the lifetime of patients not
cured. Although most studies did not report any
prognostic value regarding hemoglobin level or platelet count, some investigators have reported an
adverse impact of lower platelet count at diagnosis
on the duration of remission.14,20 Surprisingly, hemoglobin and platelet increases were selected in our
study as unfavorable for patients not cured. Although
we do not have any obvious explanation for such
findings, it is possible that there may be a correlation
between cell cycle-dependant, drug-resistant disease
in less proliferative leukemias.
In addition, the influence of gender on lifetime
was close to significance. The benefit of being a
female, which was observed previously in children
with ALL,24,25 cannot be considered in adult ALL,
because, in the current study, men had a longer
mean lifetime than women. Finally, the impact of
CNS involvement at diagnosis was low, because it
influenced lifetime independently, but it did not
influence the proportion of long-term survivors.

The intrinsic objective of any therapy is a cure.
The concept of ‘‘cured’’ patients certainly is arguable,
because late recurrence and death may occur >10
years after ALL diagnosis and treatment. Moreover,
late cancer-related deaths may be the consequence
of disease recurrence or treatment-related toxicity
(eg, secondary malignancies or cardiac toxicity).
However, it may be possible to apply this concept to
long-term survivors in accordance with the definition
of ‘‘cured’’ patients proposed by Pui et al.3 The second debatable key point is the possibility of ‘‘cure’’
after a first recurrence, for example, because of allogeneic SCT in second CR. The use of OS instead of
event-free survival is better for handling that issue
because it provides longer follow-up. Postremission
strategies could not be evaluated in the current
study, because they resulted from a combination of
different prognostic factors that were assessed at diagnosis. Further studies should define their impact
depending on the risk-adapted treatment group.
Determining the proportion of long-term survivors and the mean lifetime are essential to answer
patients’ questions. However, in patients with ALL,
the proportion of long-term survivors—and the factors that affect them—have priority, because the factors that affect lifetime are less important for
prognostic purposes. Indeed, most factors (except
karyotype), which already have been recognized and
also were identified by multivariate analyses in
others studies,4,14,20,21 seemed to concern only patients who previously were considered patients not

cured. This finding may hamper the current classifications designed to determine risk-adapted, postremission, therapeutic strategies.
Factors that predict lifetime in patients who are
not cured also may predict treatment-related toxicity.
Thus, a major gain in lifetime could be obtained
with less toxic treatments; however, this may apply
more to allogeneic stem cell transplantation than to
chemotherapy. Determining case-specific mortality
accurately should enable an analysis that attempts
to determine which factors actually influence treatment toxicity. Lowering treatment-related mortality
obviously will increase the proportion of long-term
survivors.
Today, the most promising progress seems to be
based on the improvement of cytogenetics and
molecular diagnosis or on better gene profiling using
DNA microarrays. Monitoring of minimal residual
diseases using molecular biology during follow-up
would complete the therapeutic strategy. The introduction of new targeted therapies may modify the
predictive value of the factors that were studied for
this report. This already is the case for imatinib associated with standard chemotherapy, which improved
the efficacy of induction and continuation treatments
in patients with BCR-ABL ALL26 and for rituximab in
patients with B-cell CD20-positive ALL.27
Finally, the current results foster the dialogue
between the clinicians and their patients. They also
show that current risk-adapted strategies should
focus on cytogenetics, whereas the usual factors
seem to be less important. Studies of the usual prognostic factors also should focus on treatment toxicity.
Knowledge of the genuine value of these factors is
necessary to help to elaborate studies that test new
postremission strategies.
