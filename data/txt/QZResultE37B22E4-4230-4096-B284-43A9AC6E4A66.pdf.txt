ABSTRACT
Autophagy, which is constitutively executed at the basal level in all cells,
promotes cellular homeostasis by regulating the turnover of organelles and
proteins. Andrographolide and dehydroandrographolide (DA) are the two principle
components of Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees. and are the main
contributors to its therapeutic properties. However, the pharmacological activities
of dehydroandrographolide (DA) remain unclear. In this study, DA induces oral
cancer cell death by activating autophagy. Treatment with autophagy inhibitors
inhibited DA-induced human oral cancer cell death. In addition, DA increased LC3II expression and reduced p53 expression in a time- and concentration-dependent
manner. Furthermore, DA induced autophagy and decreased cell viability through
modulation of p53 expression. DA-induced autophagy was triggered by an activation
of JNK1/2 and an inhibition of Akt and p38. In conclusion, this study demonstrated
that DA induced autophagy in human oral cancer cells by modulating p53 expression,
activating JNK1/2, and inhibiting Akt and p38. Finally, an administration of DA
effectively suppressed the tumor formation in the oral carcinoma xenograft model
in vivo. This is the first study to reveal the novel function of DA in activating autophagy,
suggesting that DA could serve as a new and potential chemopreventive agent for
treating human oral cancer.

focus is on providing a scientific basis for using these
agents as a preventive strategy for people with a high
risk of cancer. Therefore, inducing the death of cancer
cells by using chemotherapeutic agents may facili­

Autophagy is a major intracellular degradation
mechanism that operates under stress conditions and can
promote survival during starvation or lead to programmed
type II cell death under specific conditions (e.g., apoptosis
inhibition). [5–7] Autophagy is a multifaceted process, and
alterations in autophagic signaling pathways are frequently
observed in cancer. However, the role of autophagy in
cancer remains controversial. [8, 9] One hypothetical
mechanism is that autophagy promotes tumor cell survival
in response to various stresses. [10] Inhibiting autophagy
has been determined to promote tumorigenesis, whereas
enhancing autophagy in established tumors has been
reported to promote cell survival. [11, 12] Furthermore,
autophagy spatially and temporally regulates tumor
development by suppressing tumor growth through
the regulation of cell proliferation in the early stages of
tumorigenesis. [13] Therefore, reduction in the rate of
autophagy contributes to tumor formation and growth
as a result of the breakdown of tumor cells following
autophagy-related cell death, leading to tumor cell
survival. [14] Recently, the role of autophagy in cancer
development and therapy has received extensive attention.
[15–17] Certain reagents can kill cancer cells through
some non-apoptotic pathways and evade chemoresistance,
which makes such reagents promising candidate molecules
for treating drug-resistant cancers. When treated with these
reagents, tumor cells with drawback in apoptosis undergo
autophagy, and inhibiting autophagy causes tumor cells
death through alternative mechanisms. [18, 19]
The mechanism of autophagy is a highly conserved
process; genetic analyses in yeast have identified several
AuTophaGy-related (ATG) genes, many of which have
mammalian orthologs. ATG products are implicated in
autophagosome formation and associated pathways.
[20] Upon autophagy induction, light chain 3 (LC3)-I,
the mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg8, conjugates with
phosphatidylethanolamine to form the autophagosomeassociated LC3-II. LC3-II levels (relative to actin or
tubulin loading controls) correlate with autophagosome
numbers. [21] The classical pathway regulating
mammalian autophagy involves serine or threonine
kinases, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). [22]
Various signals, such as growth factors, amino acids, and
energy status, regulate autophagy through the mTORC1
pathway. [23]
In vitro studies of mammalian cells have suggested
that ROS regulate autophagy in various cell lines, because
exogenous oxidative stressors induce autophagy. For
example, H2O2 and 2-methoxyestradiol induce autophagy
in transformed HEK293 cells, U87 cells, HeLa cells, and
astrocytes. [24, 25] TNF-alpha induces autophagy in EW7
cells in a ROS-dependent manner, and H2O2 scavenging
inhibits starvation-induced autophagy. [26] Similarly, the
endotoxin LPS induces autophagy in an H2O2-dependent
manner in cardiomyocytes. [27] In addition, nitric oxide
(NO), a potent cellular messenger, inhibits autophagosome
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

synthesis through several mechanisms. NO impairs
autophagy by inhibiting the activity of S-nitrosylation
substrates, JNK1, and IKKβ. Overexpression of nNOS,
iNOS, or eNOS impairs autophagosome formation
primarily through the JNK1–Bcl-2 pathway. Conversely,
NOS inhibition enhances the clearance of autophagic
substrates. [28] These results suggest that autophagy
induction may trigger programmed type II cell death by
inhibiting NOS expression.
Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees (family,
Acanthaceae), which is grown widely in many Asian
countries, has been shown to possess various pharmacological
properties such as anticancer, anti-HIV, anti-influenza virus,
and cardioprotective properties. [29–31] The reported
primary active ingredients of A. Paniculata are several
diterpene lactones, flavonoids, and polyphenols. [32, 33]
Two principle components, namely, andrographolide and
dehydroandrographolide (DA), are believed to be the main
contributors to its therapeutic properties. Previous studies
have reported that DA inhibits LPS-induced oxidative stress
by inactivating iNOS. [34] In addition, DA inhibits viral
DNA replication. [35] These studies confirm that DA is an
iNOS inhibitor and an antiinflammatory [36] and antiviral
agent. However, the pharmacological properties of DA
remain unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize the
effects of DA on human oral cancer cells and elucidate the
underlying molecular mechanism responsible for autophagy
in DA-treated oral cancer cells.

RESULTS
Cytotoxic effects of DA on human oral cancer
cell lines
The chemical structure of DA is shown in Figure
1A. To assess the effects of DA on cell viability, SAS
and OECM-1 cells were treated with DA at various
concentrations (0–100 μM) for 24, 48, and 72 h, and
then analyzed using the MTT assay. DA substantially
reduced the cell viability after 48 h of treatment in
SAS and OECM-1 cells compared with untreated cells
(Figure 1B). In particular, DA inhibited cell viability;
this inhibition was observed within 24 h in OECM-1
cells. To further investigate the anti–cell-growth activity
of DA, a clonogenic assay was performed to determine
the long-term effect of DA treatment on oral cancer cells.
DA (25 μM) significantly inhibited the colony-formation
ability of SAS and OECM-1 cells (Figure 1C). To clarify
the relevance of DA-induced cell death, Z-VAD-FMK
(a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor) and an autophagy
inhibitor (bafilomycin A1 [BafA1], prevents maturation
of autophagic vacuoles by inhibiting fusion between
autophagosomes and lysosomes) were used in the
following experiments. DA combined with Z-VAD-FMK
did not substantially increase the cell viability of SAS and
OECM-1 cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, cotreatment with

DA and BafA1 showed that DA induced a reduction in the
percentage of viable cells. However, the viability of SAS
and OECM-1 cells increased when BafA1 was included
(Figure 1E).

did not show nucleus condensation in both cell types after
48 h of treatment with DA (100 μM) compared with the
results of treating both cell types with hispolon (10 μM)
(Figure 2A). Treatment with hispolon induces apoptosis
(positive control). [38] In addition, annexin-V/PI double
staining was performed using flow cytometry. The results
showed no significant increase in the percentage of DA
(100 μM)-treated SAS and OECM-1 cells exhibiting
phosphatidylserine externalization compared with that
of hispolon (10 μM)-treated SAS and OECM-1 cells
(Figure 2B). Nonapoptotic programmed cell death is
ascribed to type II programmed cell death, which is
autophagy dependent. Whether autophagy triggers DAinduced human oral cancer cell death was examined.
At the beginning of autophagy, the cytosolic form of
microtubule-associated protein 1 LC3-I is converted to
the phagophore- and autophagosome-bound form of LC3II. After 48 h of treatment with DA, a substantial change

DA increases cell death as a result of autophagy
induction in human oral cancer cell lines
The reasons that DA inhibits cell viability
were investigated. Autophagy and apoptosis differ in
morphological characteristics. Cells undergoing apoptosis
exhibit an increase in nuclear chromatin condensation.
Autophagy is a type of cell death that occurs in the
absence of chromatin condensation but is associated with
massive autophagic vacuolization of the cytoplasm. [37]
First, we determined whether DA-induced cell death was
related to apoptosis. DAPI staining was performed to
analyze the changes in nuclear morphology. The results

in LC3 puncta formation was observed, indicating the
formation of autophagosomes in DA (100 μM)-treated
SAS and OECM-1 cells (Figure 2C). Acidic vesicular
organelle (AVO) formation (autophagosomes and
autolysosomes) is a characteristic feature of autophagy.
[39] To detect the development of AVOs, untreated and
treated SAS and OECM-1 cells were stained with acridine
orange. DA (100 μM) induced AVO formation in SAS
and OECM-1 cells (Figure 2D). To determine whether
DA induced autophagy, the protein expression of LC3-II,
SQSTM1 (p62), and beclin-1 was analyzed. Compared
with the control, the protein expression of LC3-II and
beclin-1 increased in both cells treated for 48 h with DA
(100 μM). However, SQSTM1 expression decreased in
DA-treated cells (Figure 2E). These results, combined
with the previous results, showed that autophagy was
induced by DA.

48 h of treatment, cell viability was analyzed using the
MTT assay. DA combined with autophagy inhibitors
substantially increased the viability of SAS and OECM1 cells treated only with DA (Figure 3C). Tamoxifen, an
antagonist of the estrogen receptor, stimulates autophagy
by increasing the intracellular level of ceramide, which
inhibits mTOR activation and stimulates the expression
of Atg genes. [42] Furthermore, SAS and OECM-1 cells
were pretreated with autophagy enhancers, rapamycin (10
and 20 nM) or tamoxifen (10 and 20 μM) for 1 h before
treatment with DA (100 μM) and then analyzed using
the MTT assay for 48 h. DA combined with autophagy
enhancers reduced the viability of SAS and OECM-1 cells
treated only with DA (Figure 3D).

Effects of treatment with autophagy enhancers
or inhibitors on DA-induced cell death in
human oral cancer cell lines

To clarify the role of autophagy in DA-mediated
oral cancer cell death, an LC3 silencing experiment was
conducted using a VZV-G pseudotyped lentivirus–shRNA
system. The responses of SAS shLuc cells and OECM-1
shLuc cells were similar to those of parental SAS and
OECM-1 cells after treatment with DA. In SAS shLC3
cells and OECM-1 shLC3 cells, DA-induced LC3-II
conversion was blocked (Figure 4A). Compared with
AVO formation in SAS shLuc cells and OECM-1 shLuc
cells, DA-induced AVO formation was blunted in SAS
shLC3 cells and OECM-1 shLC3 cells (Figure 4B).
The results suggested that LC3 silencing abolishes
autophagy in SAS and OECM-1 cells treated with DA.
Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of DA (100 μM) was
significantly decreased in SAS shLC3 cells and OECM-1
shLC3 cells (Figure 4C). Investigators have demonstrated
that beclin-1−/− mice die early in embryogenesis and
beclin-1−/+ mice have a high incidence of spontaneous
tumors. Stem cells from null mice exhibited an altered
autophagic response even though responses to apoptosis
appeared normal. [43] Extracts from SAS and OECM-1
cells transfected with control siRNA, beclin-1 siRNA I,
or beclin-1 siRNA II were subjected to western blot
analysis. Beclin-1 antibody confirms silencing of beclin-1
expression (Figure 4D). DA-induced AVO formation
decreased in SAS-transfected beclin-1 siRNA cells
compared with DA-treated SAS cells (Figure 4E). The
same results were observed in OECM-1 cells. In addition,
DA-mediated cell viability was significantly increased
in beclin-1 knockdown cell lines (Figure 4F). MDC, a
specific autophagolysosome marker to analyze at the
molecular level the machinery involved in the autophagic
process, was used to further investigate the formation of
autophagosome. The results showed that the number of
MDC-labeled vesicles in DA-treated cells was increased
(Figure 4G). To clarify the DA-induced cell death mode
in OSCC, the effect of LC3 knockdown on DA-induced
cell death was detected by Annexin-V/PI double staining.

Autophagy-related gene silencing inhibits
DA-induced oral cancer cell death

Autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine [3-MA],
wortmannin, and BafA1) acting at differing stages were
used in the following experiments to elucidate their effect
on DA-induced autophagy. 3-MA inhibits autophagy by
blocking autophagosome formation via the inhibition
of type III Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI-3K).
Wortmannin, PI3K inhibitor, can inhibit autophagic
sequestration. BafA1, prevents maturation of autophagic
vacuoles by inhibiting fusion between autophagosomes
and lysosomes. SAS and OECM-1 cells were pretreated
with 3-MA (5 mM), wortmannin (50 nM), or BafA1
(1 nM) for 1 h before treatment with DA; autophagyrelated molecules were examined using western blotting.
Adding 3-MA combined with DA (100 μM) to SAS and
OECM-1 cells resulted in a slight decrease in the levels
of LC3-II and beclin-1 (Figure 3A). However, the protein
expression of SQSTM1 increased in autophagy inhibitors
combined with DA-treated cells. The same results were
observed when wortmannin or BafA1 combined with DA
was added to SAS and OECM-1 cells (Figure 3B). In
addition, rapamycin induces autophagy, because inhibition
of mTOR mimics cellular starvation by blocking signals
required for cell growth and proliferation. [40] The protein
expression of LC3-II and beclin-1 increased in cells treated
only with DA, whereas that of SQSTM1 decreased in
rapamycin- and DA-treated cells (Figure 3B). The effects
of DA combined with autophagy enhancers or inhibitors
on cell viability were assessed. SAS and OECM-1
cells were pretreated with 3-MA (5 mM), wortmannin
(50 nM), BafA1 (1 nM), or chloroquine (10 μM) for
1  h before treatment with DA (100 μM). Chloroquine
inhibits autophagy as it raises the lysosomal pH, which
leads to inhibition of both fusion of autophagosome with
lysosome and lysosomal protein degradation. [41] After

data suggested that p53 plays a vital role in DA-induced
autophagy regulation.

DA-stimulated autophagy promotes the AMPK
pathway and influence mTOR signaling

Effects of inhibiting p53 expression on
DA-induced autophagy

The kinase mTOR is a critical regulator of
autophagy induction, with activated mTOR (Akt and
mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] signaling)
suppressing autophagy and negative regulation of mTOR
(AMPK and p53 signaling) promoting it. Class I PtdIns
3-kinase generates PtdIns (3,4) P2 and PtdIns (3,4,5)
P3, which bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of
Akt and its activator 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
protein kinase-1. [45] When the Akt signaling pathway is
activated, autophagic degradation is reduced. The Class
III PI3K complex, which contains beclin-1, p150, and
Atg14-like protein or the ultraviolet-irradiation-resistanceassociated gene, is required for the induction of autophagy.
The Class III PI3K is a critical regulator of autophagy [46].
To investigate the molecular mechanisms of DA-induced
autophagy, Class I PI3K, Class III PI3K, and AMPK
expression levels and mTOR kinase activity, as measured
by its phosphorylation, were examined using DA. In DAtreated oral cancer cells, Class I PI3K expression decreased
(Figure 6A and 6B), whereas Class III PI3K expression
increased. In addition, DA significantly induced AMPK
phosphorylation and inhibited mTOR phosphorylation
compared with the vehicle control. Inhibition of
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
correlates with increased autophagy [47]. To further
investigate the mechanism of DA-induced autophagy in
human oral cancer cell lines, the expression levels of the
mTOR complex-related proteins, Raptor and TSC were
examined. The results showed that DA treatment resulted

A previous study showed that inhibition of p53 led
to autophagy in enucleated cells, and cytoplasmic, not
nuclear, p53 repressed the enhanced autophagy of p53−/−
cells. [44] Furthermore, inhibition of p53 degradation
prevented the activation of autophagy. These results
provide evidence of a key signaling pathway that links
autophagy to the cancer-associated dysregulation of
p53. [44] To clarify the associated mechanisms of DAinduced autophagy in oral cancer cells, the p53 expression
levels in DA-treated oral cancer cells were detected using
western blotting. The results showed that p53 expression
decreased in DA-treated oral cancer cells along with DAstimulated LC3-II induction (Figure 5A). In addition, DA
(100 μM) suppressed p53 expression and induced LC3II conversion in a time-dependent manner (Figure 5B).
For further confirmation of the connection between p53
expression and autophagy induction in DA-treated oral
cancer cells, SAS and OECM-1 cells were transfected with
Wt-p53 and subsequently treated with DA. DA-induced
LC3-II expression decreased in Wt-p53-transfected oral
cancer cells compared with that in the cells treated only
with DA (Figure 5C). In addition, the DA-mediated cell
viability of oral cancer cells after p53 overexpression
by transfected Wt-p53 was measured. It was noted that
p53 overexpression reduced the cell-killing effect of
DA (Figure 5D). Conversely, when p53 expression was
knocked down by p53 siRNA, viability was significantly
inhibited in DA-treated cells (Figure 5E and 5F). These

significantly disrupts the binding between TSC-1 and
TSC-2. ULK induces autophagy by phosphorylating
beclin-1 and activating VPS34 lipid kinase [50]. The
possibility of direct control of ULK via phosphorylation
by AMPK, mTORC1 may negatively regulate ULK by
phosphorylation [47]. In this study, DA treatment resulted
in the activation of ULK at Ser555. By contrast, the
level of phosphorylated ULK at Ser757 was decreased
in both cell lines (Figure 7A and 7B). Previous studies
have reported that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibited beclin-1mediated autophagy by binding to beclin-1. In addition,
beclin-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL can cooperate with Atg5 or
Ca2+ to regulate both autophagy and apoptosis. Thus, Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL play crucial roles in the cross talk between
autophagy and apoptosis [51]. In this study, Bcl-2 and BclxL expression decreased in DA-treated oral cancer cells
(Figure 7C and 7D). The expression level of Mcl-1 has
been suggested to regulate autophagic flux. Specifically,
deletion of Mcl-1 in cortical neurons of transgenic
mice has been found to activate a robust autophagic
response. [52] In addition, when Bax and Bak were
present, inhibiting the prosurvival Bcl-2 family members
stimulated autophagy. [53, 54] In this study, treatment
with DA inhibited Mcl-1 expression; however, the Bax
and Bak expression levels increased in DA-treated cells
(Figure 7E and 7F). These results demonstrate that DAinduced autophagy through promotes the AMPK pathway
and influence the expression of mTOR complex-related
proteins and ULK. In addition, DA induces beclin-1mediated autophagy by inhibiting Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and
Mcl-1 expression.

treatment with DA and ERK1/2-specific inhibitors did not
influence the LC3-II, beclin-1, and SQSTM1 expression
levels (Figure 8C and 8D). Therefore, the inhibition of
Akt, p38 phosphorylation, and enhanced JNK1/2 signaling
pathways may result in DA-induced autophagy.

Significant antiproliferative effects of DA in an
SAS orthotopic graft model
To test the effect of DA on tumor growth, the in vivo
antitumor effect of DA was evaluated. Tumor volumes
were determined by caliper measurements for every 6
days. The control group of animals transplanting SAS
cancer cells showed a progressive increase in their tumor
volumes. In DA-treated mice receiving 100 but not 40 mg/
kg, the mean tumor volume on day 24 was significantly
inhibited compared to vehicle-treated (Figure 9A). As
illustrated in Figure 9B, the mean tumor weight in DAtreated mice was smaller compared to that of mice injected
with only vehicle. No significant difference in body
weight was detected among these groups (Figure 9C). In
IHC analysis for cell proliferation, Ki67-positive tumor
cells were significantly reduced after treatment with DA
compared to control mice. In addition, the expression of
LC3 in tumor specimens was increased in the DA-treated
group compared to the control group (Figure 9D). These
results showed that animals treated with DA show antitumor growth as compared with control animals.

DISCUSSION
Autophagy is a major intracellular degradation
mechanism that causes programmed type II cell
death under specific conditions. [5–7] Autophagy is
a multifaceted process, and alterations in autophagic
signaling pathways are frequently observed in cancer.
Previous studies have reported that different ROS have
different effects on autophagy. Superoxides induce
autophagy, [56] and NOs impair autophagosome
synthesis. Overexpression of nNOS, iNOS, or eNOS
inhibits autophagic flux primarily through the JNK1–
Bcl-2 pathway. Conversely, NOS inhibition enhances
the clearance of autophagic substrates. [28] These
results suggest that autophagy induction may trigger
the inhibition of NOS expression. Our data suggest that
distinct mechanisms related to DA induce autophagy.
First, DA inhibits p53 expression, leading to autophagy
in oral cancer cells. In this study, DA suppressed p53
expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Figure 5A and 5B). In addition, p53 overexpression
reduced LC3-II expression (Figure 5C) and the percentage
of DA-induced cell death (Figure 5D). Conversely,
when p53 expression was reduced by transfecting cells
with specific p53 siRNA, DA-induced autophagy cell
death increased (Figure 5F). Second, Akt and mTOR
phosphorylation decreased in a manner that was related to

DA induces cell autophagy by inhibiting Akt
and p38 phosphorylation and enhancing
JNK1/2 activation
MAPK signaling plays a critical role in the
outcome of and sensitivity to anticancer therapies.
Apoptosis and autophagy can be induced by extracellular
stimuli such as treatment with chemotherapeutic agents,
resulting in different cell responses to these drugs.
[55] To further clarify the association between DAinduced autophagy and MAPK signaling, the activation
of MAPK was investigated in DA-treated oral cancer
cells. In this study, treatment with DA inhibited Akt and
p38 phosphorylation; however, the ERK1/2 and JNK
phosphorylation expression levels increased in DA-treated
cells (Figure 8A and 8B). According to previous studies,
we investigated the effects of DA on specific inhibitors
of ERK1/2 (U0126) and JNK1/2 (SP600125) in SAS and
OECM-1 cells. The data showed that combined treatment
with the JNK1/2 inhibitor and DA at 100 μM further
reduced LC3-II and beclin-1 expression. The SQSTM1
expression levels were increased by combined treatment
with the JNK1/2 inhibitor and DA at 100 μM (Figure 8C
and 8D). Conversely, the results showed that combined

treatment with DA (Figures 5A and 6A). Previous studies
have reported that AMPK and mTOR regulate autophagy
through direct Ulk1 phosphorylation, and activated
AMPK promotes the inhibition of mTOR kinase. [57]
In this study, AMPK phosphorylation increased in DAtreated cells (Figure 5A). In addition, DA specifically
inhibited Class I PI3K expression and increased Class III
PI3K expression. These results are consistent with those
of the previous studies. [58] Wortmannin and 3-MA are
inhibitors of PI3K that blocks autophagy at an early stage;
3-MA inhibits autophagy by inhibiting Class III PI3K
expression and, thus, blocking autophagosome formation.
[59, 60] LC3-II, beclin-1, and SQSTM1 were affected by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment with 3-MA or wortmannin. In addition, DAinduced cell death decreased under 3-MA or wortmannin
treatment conditions (Figure 3). In the presence of
BafA1, accumulation of LC3-II-positive autophagosomes
would be evidence of efficient autophagic flux, while
failure of LC3-II protein to increase in the presence of
BafA1, would indicate a defect or delay earlier in the
process, prior to degradation at the autolysosome. LC3II accumulation is increased in the presence of BafA1.
[61, 62] These results reveal that DA induces autophagy
cell death in oral cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway. Third, DA induces cell autophagy by
reducing Akt and p38 phosphorylation and by inducing

JNK1/2 activation. Previous studies have shown that
SAHA-induced autophagy in glioblastoma stem cells
depends the inhibition of mTOR through the inhibition
of Akt activation. [63] Wang et al. determined that active
Akt can inhibit autophagy through mTOR-independent
mechanisms and Akt-mediated regulation of autophagy
through beclin-1 phosphorylation. [64] Autophagy
deficiency increases the activation of p38 [65]. The p38
MAPK has a dual role in the regulation of autophagy,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as both a positive and negative regulator. [55] Our data
show that DA inhibits Akt and p38 phosphorylation.
The results are consistent with those of previous studies.
[64, 66] Furthermore, our data suggest that DA induces
autophagy by activating JNK1/2 but not ERK1/2 (Figure
8C and 8D). These results are consistent with those of
previous studies [67, 68] and indicate that DA may be
involved in other cellular signaling responses. Fourth, DA

cells. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit autophagy by binding to
beclin-1. The inhibition of Mcl-1 is hypothesized to
induce autophagic cell death. In this study, Bcl-2, BclxL and Mcl-1 expression levels decreased in DA-treated
oral cancer cells. Furthermore, DA-induced autophagy
enhanced JNK1/2 signaling pathways (Figure 8C
and 8D). Activation of JNK1, but not JNK2, has been
recently shown to mediate starvation-induced autophagy
in mammalian cells by phosphorylating Bcl-2. [69] These
results show that one of the distinct mechanisms associated
with DA-induced autophagy may inhibit Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL expression or influence Bcl-2 phosphorylation by
increasing JNK activation, which reduces Bcl-2–beclin 1
bind. However, additional experimental studies are
required to confirm this finding. Finally, an administration
of DA effectively suppressed the tumor formation in the
xenograft model in vivo (Figure 9). The mean tumor
volume in DA treated mice was smaller compared to
control, however, is somewhat at odds with the in vitro
data (Figure 1).
In conclusion, our results reveal that DA inhibits
cell viability and induces autophagy in oral cancer cells,
suggesting that DA, an iNOS inhibitor, is an attractive
candidate for tumor therapies. DA could serve as a new
and potential chemopreventive agent for treating human
oral cancer.

(5 mice/group). All animals were housed with a regular
