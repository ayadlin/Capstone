Abstract
Aurora kinases play an important role in chromosome alignment, segregation, and cytokinesis during mitosis.
In the present study, we used a ligand docking method to explore the novel scaffold of potential Aurora B
inhibitors. One thousand compounds from our in-house compound library were screened against the Aurora B
structure and one compound, (E)-3-((E)-4-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-2-oxobut-3-en-1-ylidene)indolin-2-one
(designated herein as HOI-07) was selected for further study. HOI-07 potently inhibited in vitro Aurora B kinase
activity in a dose-dependent manner, without obvious inhibition of another 49 kinases, including Aurora A. This
compound suppressed Aurora B kinase activity in lung cancer cells, evidenced by the inhibition of the
phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser10 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibition resulted in
apoptosis induction, G2–M arrest, polyploidy cells, and attenuation of cancer cell anchorage-independent growth.
Moreover, knocking down the expression of Aurora B effectively reduced the sensitivity of cancer cells to HOI-07.
Results of an in vivo xenograft mouse study showed that HOI-07 treatment effectively suppressed the growth of
A549 xenografts, without affecting the body weight of mice. The expression of phospho-histone H3, phosphoAurora B, and Ki-67 was also suppressed in the HOI-07 treatment group. Taken together, we identiﬁed HOI-07 as a
speciﬁc Aurora B inhibitor, which deserves further investigation. Cancer Res; 73(2); 716–24. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Targeting the progression of mitosis is a highly successful
strategy for anticancer treatment (1). A closely related subgroup of 3 serine/threonine kinases, the Aurora kinases, are
believed to play a key role in protein phosphorylation in mitosis
and have been shown to contribute in the development and
progression of cancer. In mammals, the Aurora kinase family
comprises 3 members: Aurora A, B, and C (2). They display
distinct roles during mitosis, which are reﬂected in their
subcellular locations and functions. Aurora A is localized at
the centrosome from the time of centrosome duplication
through mitotic exit. It has been implicated in several pro-

cesses required for the generation of bipolar spindle apparatus,
including centrosome maturation and separation (3, 4). Smallmolecule inhibition of Aurora A kinase activity causes defects
in centrosome separation with the formation of characteristic
monopolar spindles (5). Aurora B is localized to the centromeres from the prophase to the metaphase–anaphase transition. Thereafter, it is localized to midzone spindle microtubules during the telophase and subsequently to midbody
during cytokinesis (2, 3). Aurora B is a chromosomal passenger
protein in complex with the inner centromere proteins
(INCENP), survivin, and borealin. During mitosis, as the "equatorial kinase," Aurora B is required for histone H3 phosphorylation, chromosome biorientation, the spindle assembly
checkpoint, and cytokinesis (6, 7). Inhibition of Aurora B kinase
activity with small molecules leads to failure in cytokinesis and
abnormal exit from mitosis, resulting in endoreduplication,
polyploidy cells, and ultimately apoptosis (8, 9). Aurora C is also
a chromosomal passenger protein considered to have a similar
subcellular location as Aurora B. It has been described only in
mammals, where it is expressed in testis and certain tumor cell
lines and localizes to spindle poles during late mitosis (2, 10).
Inhibition of Aurora kinases had been shown to be an
effective strategy for anticancer therapy, and several Aurora
inhibitors have been described, including VX-680 (11), Hesperadin (8), AZD1152 (12), and MLN8237 (13). More than 30 smallmolecule Aurora kinase inhibitors are currently in different
stages of preclinical and clinical development (14); however,
none have yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for clinical use.

HOI-07 Is a Novel Aurora B Inhibitor

HOI-07 on MRC-5 normal lung cells (C) and A549 lung cancer cells (D). No obvious cytotoxicity by HOI-07 was observed in either MRC-5 and A549 cells at
concentrations below 1 mmol/L.

Herein, we used a ligand docking computational method to
identify (E)-3-((E)-4-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-2-oxobut-3-en1-ylidene)indolin-2-one (i.e., HOI-07) as a novel Aurora B
kinase inhibitor. Biologic testing further conﬁrmed that
HOI-07 selectively and potently inhibited Aurora B activity
and exhibited antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and materials
Compound HOI-07 was synthesized in-house following
the reported protocol of similar compounds but with some
modiﬁcations (15). All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were cultured in
monolayers at 37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator according to
ATCC protocols. Cells were cytogenetically tested and
authenticated before the cells were frozen. Each vial of
frozen cells was thawed and maintained for about 2 months
(10 passages). For transfection experiments, the jetPEI
(Qbiogene, Inc.) transfection reagent was used following the
manufacturer's instructions.

Anchorage-independent cell transformation assay
Tumor cells were suspended in Basal Medium Eagle media
and added to 0.6% agar, with different concentrations of HOI07 in a base layer and a top layer of 0.3% agar. The cultures
were maintained at 37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 1 to 2
weeks, and then colonies were counted under a microscope
using the Image-Pro Plus software (v.4) program (Media
Cybernetics).
Cell-cycle and apoptosis analyses
Cells were plated in 60-mm plates and treated or not treated
with HOI-07 for the indicated time. At each time point, cells
were ﬁxed in 70% ethanol and stored at 20 C for 24 hours.
After staining, cell-cycle distribution or apoptosis was determined using a BD FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences).
MTS assay
To estimate the cytotoxicity of HOI-07, cells were seeded
(8  103 cells per well) in 96-well plates and cultured overnight.

Cells were then fed with fresh medium and treated with
different doses of HOI-07. After culturing for various times,
the cytotoxicity of HOI-07 was measured using an MTS assay
kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Western blot analysis
Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Millipore), which were
blocked with nonfat milk and hybridized with speciﬁc primary
antibodies. The protein bands were visualized using an
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare) after
hybridization with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibody.
Aurora B and Aurora A in vitro kinase assays
Inactive histone 3 proteins (1 mg) were used as the substrate
for an in vitro kinase assay with 100 ng of active Aurora B or
Aurora A kinase. Reactions were carried out in1 kinase buffer
[25 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate, 2
mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, and 5 mmol/L MnCl2] containing 100 mmol/L ATP at
30 C for 30 minutes. Reactions were stopped and proteins
detected by Western blotting.
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
A549 cells were seeded in 4-chamber slides and cultured
overnight. The cells were then treated with dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) or HOI-07 (1 mmol/L) for 48 hours at 37 C. After
treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed with
methanol for 12 hours, followed by blocking with 3% PBS for
1 hour. The cells were then incubated with an a-tubulin
antibody (1:100) overnight, and DNA was stained with 40 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Pierce) for 30 minutes at
room temperature. The cells were evaluated by ﬂuorescent
microscopy.
Hematoxylin–eosin staining and immunohistochemistry
Tumor tissues from mice were embedded in a parafﬁn block
and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
immunohistochemistry. Tumor tissues were deparafﬁnized
and hydrated, then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100/1
PBS for 10 minutes, hybridized with phospho-histone H3 (1:50),
phospho-Aurora B (1:50), and Ki-67 (1:500) as the primary
antibodies and an HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody
was used as the secondary antibody. After developing with 3,30 diaminobenzidine, the sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin. All sections were observed by microscope
(400 magniﬁcation) and the Image-Pro Plus software (v.4)
program (Media Cybernetics).
Xenograft mouse model
Athymic nude mice [Cr:NIH (S), NIH Swiss nude, 6-week-old]
were obtained from Harlan Laboratories and maintained
under "speciﬁc pathogen-free" conditions based on the guidelines established by the University of Minnesota (Austin, MN)
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were
divided into different groups (n ¼ 10 in each group). A549

Results
The predicted binding mode of HOI-07 with Aurora B and
cytotoxicity
With the purpose of identifying a novel Aurora B kinase
inhibitor, we conducted an intensive molecular docking analysis using Glide v5.7 (16) to screen our in-house library of
compounds against the structure of Aurora B. HOI-07 (Fig.
1A) was identiﬁed as a potential Aurora B inhibitor based on
its high docking score. HOI-07 is a novel compound synthesized in our laboratory. The predicted binding mode of
HOI-07 and Aurora B showed that HOI-07 occupies the ATPbinding site and forms a hydrogen bond with amino acid
Ala173 in the hinge linker region, which is quite similar to
the binding mode of other Aurora B kinase inhibitors
(Fig. 1B). We then examined the toxicity of HOI-07 on both

MRC-5 normal lung cells (Fig. 1C) and A549 lung cancer cells
(Fig. 1D). The result showed that HOI-07 possessed substantial toxicity to both cell types at concentrations greater
than 10 mmol/L. At a concentration of 1 mmol/L or less, no
obvious cytotoxic effects were observed in either cell line. At
5 mmol/L, HOI-07 treatment for 48 hours resulted in a weak
toxicity toward A549 cancer cells but not to MRC-5 normal
cells.

their anchorage-independent growth in a concentrationdependent manner. HOI-07 at 0.5 or 1 mmol/L caused a
decrease of more than 80 or 90% compared with control in
all cell lines detected. The inhibition by HOI-07 was not due
to cytotoxicity because no toxicity was observed at 1 mmol/L
HOI-07 (Fig. 1). Therefore, the results indicated that HOI-07 is
a novel and very potent compound possessing antitumor
activity and deserves further investigation. We also examined the effect of HOI-07 in a pair of colon cancer cell lines,
p53 wild-type (HCT116 p53þ/þ) and p53-deﬁcient (HCT116
p53/) cells to determine whether the sensitivity of cells to
HOI-07 directly correlates with the status of p53 in cells. Soft
agar assay results showed that HCT116 p53/ cells are
more sensitive to HOI-07 than HCT116 p53þ/þ cells (Fig. 2D).
HOI-07 at 0.05 mmol/L caused a 40% inhibition of growth of
HCT116 p53/ cells, whereas no inhibition was observed in
the wild-type p53 cells. Moreover, 0.1 mmol/L HOI-07 inhib-

ited growth by more than 95% in HCT116/ cells but only
55% inhibition in HCT116 p53þ/þ cells. These data are
consistent with a previous report (9) showing that p53/
cells are more sensitive to Aurora B inhibitors compared
with p53þ/þ cells.
HOI-07 is a potent inhibitor of Aurora B, but not Aurora A
We then used an in vitro kinase assay with a recombinant
Aurora B protein and various concentrations of HOI-07 to
determine whether HOI-07 could inhibit Aurora B kinase
activity. Results indicated that the phosphorylation of histone
H3 on Ser10, an Aurora B substrate, was strongly inhibited by
HOI-07 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). For
example, 0.05 mmol/L HOI-07 caused a 22% inhibition of
Aurora B kinase activity and 0.1 mmol/L HOI-07 resulted in
a 50% inhibition. At a concentration of 1 mmol/L, only a weak
histone H3 (Ser10) band was observed. In addition, we also

ylation on Ser10 in cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the Aurora B kinases are
involved in the antitumor activity of HOI-07.
HO1-07 induces polyploidy, cell-cycle arrest, and
apoptosis in lung cancer cells
Aurora B inhibition leads to failure in cytokinesis and
abnormal exit from mitosis, which could result in polyploidy
cells, cell-cycle arrest, and ultimately, apoptosis. The ability to
induce polyploidy cells was further examined in A549 cells
treated or not treated with HOI-07. Immunoﬂuorescence
results showed that treatment of A549 cells with 1 mmol/L
HOI-07 caused the induction of polyploidy cells, whereas no
polyploidy cells were observed in control cells (Fig. 4A). In
addition, HOI-07 treatment for 48 hours caused an increase in
the number of A549 (Fig. 4B) and H520 cells (Fig. 4C) occupying
the G2–M phase. Moreover, exposure of these cells to HOI-07
for 72 hours induced apoptosis as measured by Annexin V/
propidium iodide (PI) staining (Fig. 4D and E). For example,
exposure to 5 mmol/L HOI-07 induced 48.6% or 83.4% apoptosis
in A549 cells and H520 cells, compared with 8% or 41.3% in
untreated control cells, respectively. These results showed that
HOI-07, as an Aurora B inhibitor, induces polyploidy, apoptosis, and G2–M phase arrest in cancer cells and thus inhibits the
growth of cancer cells.

examined the effect of HOI-07 on Aurora A kinase activity
using an in vitro kinase assay, and no effect on histone H3
(Ser10) phosphorylation was observed at 1 mmol/L HOI-07
compared with control (Fig. 3B). These results continued to
support HOI-07 as a potent inhibitor of Aurora B kinase
activity.
HOI-07 blocks phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser10 in
lung cancer cells
To provide evidence showing that HOI-07 is acting by
inhibiting Aurora B in cancer cells, we examined its effects
on Aurora B downstream signaling. Evidence has shown that
histone H3 is a direct downstream target of the Aurora kinases.
Phosphorylation of a highly conserved serine residue (Ser10) in
histone H3 is thought to be crucial for entry into mitosis. Our
results showed that HOI-07 suppresses histone H3 phosphor-

Knockdown of Aurora B decreases the sensitivity of
cancer cells to HOI-07
We then examined whether knocking down Aurora B
expression inﬂuences the sensitivity of A549 cancer cells to
HOI-07. The efﬁciency of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown was examined, and the expression of Aurora B was
obviously decreased after shRNA transfection (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the growth of cells in soft agar also decreased after
transfection compared with the mock group (Fig. 5B). HOI07 (0.5 mmol/L) inhibited anchorage-independent growth of
A549 cells transfected with mock shRNA by about 90%. In
contrast, the inhibition was less than 40% in A549 cells
transfected with Aurora B shRNA, indicating that A549 cells
transfected with Aurora B shRNAs were more resistant to HOI07 treatment (Fig. 5B). These results suggested that Aurora B
plays an important role in the sensitivity of A549 cells to the
antiproliferative effects of HOI-07.
Kinase proﬁle result
To identify other potential targets of HOI-07, a kinase proﬁle
assay was conducted by Millipore, in which 49 kinases were
examined. Only Akt2 activity was suppressed more than 50%
after 5 mmol/L HOI-07 treatment, compared with an untreated
control (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, the kinase activity of Aurora A was decreased less than 25% at 5 mmol/L
HOI-07.
HOI-07 inhibits Akt1 and 2 kinase activities in vitro, but

Akt2 in vitro kinase assays and results indicated that HOI-07
inhibited both Akt1 (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and Akt2 (Supplementary Fig. S1B) in vitro kinase activities in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with 5 mmol/L HOI-07
caused a 32% or 52% inhibition of Akt1 or Akt2 activity,
respectively, which is quite consistent with the kinase proﬁler
assay result. However, Western blot analysis of A549 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1C) and H520 cells (Supplementary Fig.

no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt or its downstream
signaling molecules, including Akt (Ser473), GSK3b (Ser9),
p70S6K (Thr389), or S6 (Ser235,236). These results indicated
that although HOI-07 can inhibit Akt1 and Akt2 in vitro kinase
activity, it has no effect on Akt activity in cancer cells, suggesting that Akt1 and Akt2 might not be major antitumor targets of
HOI-07.

HOI-07 suppresses the growth of A549 xenografts in vivo
We then evaluated the ability of HOI-07 to inhibit the growth
of human A549 lung cancer cell xenografts in athymic nude
mice. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week, and mouse
weights were determined once a week. HOI-07 caused a marked
reduction in tumor size in the human A549 xenograft model
(Fig. 6A). In mice treated with HOI-07 at 20 mg/kg, twice a week
intraperitoneally, mean tumor volumes were reduced to 164
mm3 in comparison with control group (408 mm3; P < 0.01). In
addition, no obvious loss of body weight was observed (Fig. 6B),
indicating that HOI-07 is well tolerated by the mice. Moreover,
the effects of HOI-07 on phosphorylation of histone H3 and
Aurora B and Ki-67 a tumor proliferation marker were evaluated
by immunohistochemistry and H&E staining of A549 tumor
tissues after the 31 days of treatment. The expression of all 3,
including Ki-67, was markedly decreased by HOI-07 (Fig. 6C).

These results indicated that HOI-07 suppressed tumor growth
in vivo.

Discussion
Cancer is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled
proliferation of abnormal cells. Modulation of atypical cellcycle regulation would therefore be a valuable therapeutic
strategy for different types of tumors. Aurora kinases regulate many processes during cell division. Aurora B kinases
are essential for chromosome condensation, kinetochore
function, cytokinesis, and the proper function of the spindle
assembly checkpoint when spindle tension is perturbed
(2, 6, 9, 17). Accumulating evidence has shown that Aurora
B is implicated in cancer. For example, the expression of
Aurora B is frequently elevated in various types of cancer,
including non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colon, and
prostate (18–20). The evidence linking Aurora overexpression and malignancy has generated signiﬁcant interest in the
development of small-molecule inhibitors against these
proteins.
Oxindoles (indolin-2-ones) are an important class of molecules, which are known to possess a wide variety of biologic
properties, and in particular, as protein kinase inhibitors (21).
In the present study, HOI-07 was identiﬁed, using molecular
docking methods, as an Aurora B kinase inhibitor. The structure of the molecule HOI-07 is oxindole-based; however, it is
structurally different from reported oxindole-containing Aurora inhibitors. Up until now, only one molecule, which is similar
to HOI-07, has been reported in the literature, but without any
known biologic activity (15).
The results of an Aurora B kinase assay clearly showed
that HOI-07 potently and dose dependently inhibited Aurora
B kinase in vitro activity, indicating that this compound is a
potent and novel Aurora B inhibitor. In addition, HOI-07 had
no effect on Aurora A kinase in vitro activity at the same
concentration. A previous report showed that cells treated
with an Aurora kinase inhibitor entered and exited mitosis
without cell division and then proceeded to a second Sphase (9). Therefore, we further examined the effect of HOI07 on cancer cells and results showed that HOI-07 suppressed cell growth in a panel of NSCLC cell line. The
inhibition was associated with induction of polyploidy cells,
accumulation of G2–M cells, as well as apoptosis, which is
consistent with Aurora B inhibition. Moreover, knocking
down Aurora B expression in A549 cells decreased their
sensitivity to HOI-07, indicating that Aurora B plays an
important role in the antitumor activity of HOI-07. An in
vivo xenograft study also indicated that HOI-07 effectively
suppressed tumor growth without affecting mouse body
weight and was accompanied with a decrease in Ki-67
expression, which is a marker of proliferation. HOI-07 treatment also decreased phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10)
and Aurora B in tumor tissues.
According to our kinase proﬁling results, in which 49
kinases treated or not treated with HOI-07 were examined,
Akt might also be a potential target of HOI-07. Further
experimental results showed that HOI-07 inhibited Akt1 and
Akt2 kinase activity in vitro at a higher concentration (1

www.aacrjournals.org

mmol/L or more) than that required for Aurora B inhibition
(1 mmol/L or lower). However, it had no effect on Akt
downstream signaling in cancer cells, indicating that Akt
might not be a major target of HOI-07. Together, these
results indicated that HOI-07 is a potent and selective
inhibitor of Aurora B. More than 30 Aurora kinase inhibitors
are in different stages of preclinical and clinical development
currently (22). Most of the Aurora inhibitors are pan-Aurora
inhibitors or Aurora A selective inhibitors, whereas only limited
Aurora B selective inhibitors have been reported, including
compound AZD1152, which also inhibits Aurora A at higher
concentrations (IC50 of 0.37 vs. 1,368 nmol/L for Aurora B and
Aurora A kinases, respectively; 22). Here, we identiﬁed HOI-07
as an Aurora kinase inhibitor that is speciﬁc for the Aurora B
isoform. Previous reports showed that treatment of cells with
dual inhibitors of Aurora A and B results in mitotic defect
resembling inactivation of Aurora B. This might be caused by
the potential mechanism by which Aurora B is responsible for
mitotic arrest in the absence of Aurora A (17). Meanwhile,
several studies showed that Aurora A and B should be distinguished as 2 distinctive therapeutic objectives that can be
targeted independently (23, 24). Thus, our identiﬁcation of
HOI-07 as a speciﬁc Aurora B inhibitor provides one more
useful tool to study the phenomenon of Aurora B–speciﬁc
inhibition and to distinguish the potential differences between
inactivation of Aurora A and B. Our work also presents a novel
Aurora B selective inhibitor, which suppresses tumor growth
both in vitro and in vivo and deserves further investigation and
development.
