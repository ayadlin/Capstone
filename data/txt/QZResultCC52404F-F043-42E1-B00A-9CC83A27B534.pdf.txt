Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Acetylation of the RelA subunit of NF-κB at lysine-310 regulates the transcriptional activation of
NF-κB target genes and contributes to maintaining constitutively active NF-κB in tumors.
Bromodomain-containing factor Brd4 has been shown to bind to acetylated lysine-310 and to
regulate the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, but the role of this binding in maintaining
constitutively active NF-κB in tumors remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate the structural
basis for the binding of bromodomains of Brd4 to acetylated lysine-310 and identify bromodomain
inhibitor JQ1 as an effective small molecule to block this interaction. JQ1 suppresses TNF-αmediated NF-κB activation and NF-κB-dependent target gene expression. Additionally, JQ1
inhibits the proliferation and transformation potential of A549 lung cancer cells and suppresses the
tumorigenicity of A549 cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that depletion of Brd4 or treatment of cells with JQ1 induces the ubiquitination
and degradation of constitutively active nuclear form of RelA. Our results identify a novel
function of Brd4 in maintaining the persistently active form of NF-κB found in tumors, and they
suggest that interference with the interaction between acetylated RelA and Brd4 could be a
potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of NF-κB-driven cancer.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Transcription factor NF-κB/Rel family proteins are master regulators of immune and
inflammatory responses. The prototypical NF-κB, a heterodimer of p50 and RelA, is
sequestered in the cytoplasm by its association with the inhibitor IκBα in unstimulated cells.
A variety of stimuli, including proinflammatory cytokines, T or B cell signals, and bacterial
or viral products, activate NF-κB by triggering the activation of IκB kinases, leading to the
phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (1–3).
Once in the nucleus, NF-κB binds to the cognate κB enhancers and stimulates the
expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. In addition to its
essential role in immunity, NF-κB is also a key player in the initiation and progression of
human cancer (4–6). Many oncogenic proteins activate NF-κB, and constitutively active
NF-κB is found in a variety of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (6–9). Various
animal models of cancer in which NF-κB signaling is disrupted by genetic approaches also
demonstrate the promoting role of NF-κB in inflammation-linked cancer (10). In fact, many
of the key hallmarks of cancer, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation,
angiogenesis, and metastasis, are known to be regulated by target genes of NF-κB (8, 11).

Posttranslational modifications of histone and non-histone proteins, including
phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination, have been shown to be
critically involved in transcription regulation and cancer development (12, 13). Emerging
evidence suggests that reversible acetylation of the RelA subunit of NF-κB plays an
important role in modulating the pathophysiologic functions of NF-κB (14, 15). Stimuluscoupled acetylation of RelA by p300/CBP at lysine-310 enhances the transcriptional activity
of NF-κB (16, 17). Conversely, deacetylation of lysine-310 by histone deacetylases
(HDACs) reduces transcriptional activity of NF-κB and sensitizes cells to TNF-α-induced
apoptosis (16, 18). Hyperacetylated RelA has also been found in many cancer cells, and
acetylation accounts for constitutively active NF-κB in cancer cells by prolonging NF-κB
nuclear retention in tumors (19, 20). We have recently shown that acetylated lysine-310 of
RelA is specifically recognized by bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) via its two
bromodomains (21). Binding of Brd4 to acetylated lysine-310 recruits and activates CDK9
of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex to phosphorylate RNA
polymerase II for the transcriptional activation of a subset of NF-κB target genes (21).
However, it is not clear whether binding of Brd4 to acetylated lysine-310 also contributes to
the persistence of constitutively active NF-κB in tumors.
The multi-functional Brd4 belongs to the BET family of proteins that contain two tandem
bromodomains and an extra terminal (ET) domain (22–24). Brd4 binds to papillomavirus E2
proteins and tethers the viral DNA to host mitotic chromosomes for segregation of its
genome into daughter cells (25). Brd4 also regulates gene transcription by recruiting
different transcription components, such as Mediator and P-TEFb, to selective target genes
by binding to acetylated histone H3 or H4 (26, 27). Recent studies have suggested that Brd4
might have additional function in tumorigenesis. Chromosome translocation involving Brd4
is found in NUT (nuclear protein in testis) midline carcinoma, and the resulting fusion Brd4NUT oncoprotein is responsible for the pathogenesis of this rare human cancer (28). Brd4
has also been shown to be required for the maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia (29). The

essential role of Brd4 in cancer development is further demonstrated by the recent findings
that small molecules targeting bromodomains of Brd4 possess strong anti-tumor activities
(29–31). These small molecules displace BET bromodomains from histones by
competitively binding to the acetylated lysine recognition pocket (30, 32, 33). One of these
BET inhibitors (BETi), JQ1, induces rapid differentiation and growth arrest of cells from
NUT midline carcinoma and displays anti-tumor effects in several hematologic
malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Burkitt’s
lymphoma (29–31, 34). Interestingly, another BETi, I-BET, suppresses inflammatory gene
expression and protects mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock and
bacteria-induced sepsis (32). Brd4 functions as a coactivator of NF-κB, which plays an
essential role in regulating the inflammatory response and in the development of cancer,
raising the intriguing question of whether the anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects of
BETi might be partially derived from dislocation of Brd4 from the acetylated RelA subunit
of NF-κB.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In an effort to understand the function of Brd4 binding to acetylated RelA in cancer cells, we
found that Brd4 maintained the nuclear NF-κB levels by preventing its ubiquitination and
degradation. Blockage of the interaction between Brd4 and RelA with JQ1 inhibits NF-κB
activation and suppresses the proliferation and tumorigenicity of A549 lung cancer cells.
Our results reveal a mechanism by which binding of Brd4 to acetylated RelA contributes to
constitutively active NF-κB in cancer cells and suggest possible therapeutic approaches for
the treatment of NF-κB-driven cancer by targeting the interaction between NF-κB and Brd4.

Results
Structural basis for the binding of Brd4 to acetylated lysine-310 of RelA
We have previously shown that Brd4 coactivates transactivation of NF-κB by binding, via
its two bromodomains (BDs), to acetylated lysine-310 of the RelA subunit of NF-κB (21).
In order to understand the molecular basis of this interaction, we sought to determine the
three-dimensional structure of each of the two bromodomains in complex with a peptide
encompassing the acetylated lysine-310 of RelA. The co-crystal structure of BD1 was
solved to 1.5 Å resolution and that of BD2 to 2.0 Å resolution.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although the identical peptide was used for the co-crystallization with each of the two
bromodomain structures, the binding orientation of the peptide in each structure is distinct.
Our structural data reveal that acetylated lysine-310 (AcLys310) directly interacts with the
highly conserved asparagine (Asn) residues in both of the bromodomains (Asn140 in BD1
and Asn433 in BD2) (Figure 1A& 1B). Specifically, AcLys310 forms a hydrogen bond
through the carbonyl oxygen of the acetylated side chain to the nitrogen atom of the
respective asparagine residue in each structure (Figure 1A & 1B). Apart from the
conservation of this notable interaction, each bromodomain engages the peptide in markedly
different manners. In the BD1 co-crystal structure, the peptide adopts a helical conformation
and AcLys310 is located at the base of the helix where it points into a binding cleft (Figure
1A). There are no additional hydrogen bond interactions between BD1 and the peptide,
although there are a number of van der Waals contacts. In contrast, in the BD2 co-crystal
structure, the peptide adopts a slightly more extended conformation. Most notably,

histidine-437 (His437) is located immediately adjacent to the AcLys310 binding site, where
it engages in hydrogen bonding interactions with both threonine-308 (Thr308) and
serine-311 (Ser311) of RelA (Figure 1B). This residue is unique to BD2, and, in the BD1 cocrystal structure the corresponding residue (Asp144) is diverted away from the binding site
and does not make any contacts with the RelA peptide (Figure 1A). The additional
interactions between His437 of BD2 and Thr308 and Ser311 of RelA may account for
ligand specificity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further confirm the importance of the key amino acids (Asn140 in BD1 and Asn433 in
BD2) in the interaction with acetylated lysine-310, we mutated these amino acids together
with the adjacent highly conserved tyrosines to alanines (Figure 1C) and investigated the
effect of these mutations on the interaction with the acetylated lysine-310 peptides. In the
GST pull-down experiment, GST-Brd4 fusion proteins containing both bromodomains were
used to pull down acetylated RelA at lysine-310 (Figure 1C, right panels). Bromodomains of
Brd4 successfully pulled down acetylated RelA (Figure 1C). Mutation of the highly
conserved asparagine and tyrosine within BD1 (designated as M1) or within BD2
(designated as M2) decreased the interaction with acetylated RelA (Figure 1C, right panels).
Simultaneously mutation of these amino acids (designated as M1/2) abolished the
interaction with acetylated RelA (Figure 1C, right panels). These mutagenesis studies further
confirm that amino acids identified from our structural study are indeed involved in the
interaction with acetylated RelA.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since Brd4 coactivates transcriptional activity of NF-κB by binding to acetylated lysine-310
of RelA (21), we next assessed the abilities of these Brd4 mutants to coactivate NF-κB.
Wild-type Brd4 enhanced transcriptional activity of RelA in the κB-luciferase reporter assay
(Figure 1D). However, mutation of these key amino acids to alanines within BD1 or BD2 or
both BD1 and BD2 impaired the coactivation function of Brd4 (Figure 1D). Mutation of
these amino acids also compromised Brd4’s ability to coactivate TNF-α-induced
endogenous NF-κB activation (Figure 1E). Furthermore, when siRNA resistant mouse Brd4
was re-introduced into Brd4 knockdown HEK293T cells, WT but not mutant Brd4 was able
to recover reduced TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in κB-luciferase reporter assay (Figure
1F). Similarly, in Brd4 knockdown A549 cells, WT but not mutant Brd4 rescued TNF-αinduced NF-κB target gene expression (Figure 1G). These results support the notion that
binding of Brd4 to acetylated lysine-310 via its two bromodomains is critical for the
coactivation function of Brd4 for NF-κB target gene expression.
JQ1 inhibits the binding of Brd4 to acetylated lysine-310 and suppresses NF-κB activation
Bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 specifically binds to the asparagines of the bromodomains of
Brd4 and prevents the binding of acetylated histone peptides to the binding pocket (30). Our
structural and mutagenesis analysis of the bromodomains of Brd4 also reveals that these
highly conserved asparagines are critically involved in the direct interaction with acetylated
lysine-310 of RelA (Figure 1), raising the possibility that JQ1 might interfere with the
binding of acetylated RelA to the bromodomains of Brd4. To test this possibility, we first
employed an in vitro peptide-binding assay to examine the effect of JQ1 on the binding of
Brd4 bromodomains to acetylated lysine-310 RelA peptides. In this binding assay, biotin-

labeled RelA peptides containing acetylated lysine-310 were used to pull-down recombinant
GST-fusion proteins of the bromodomains of Brd4. Acetylated lysine-310 peptides were
found to associate with a substantial amount of bromodomains of Brd4 (Figure 2A).
Notably, the interaction was inhibited by the addition of JQ1 (Figure 2A), suggesting that
JQ1 inhibits the binding of acetylated lysine-310 RelA peptides to the bromodomains of
Brd4. To further confirm this, we examined the effect of JQ1 on the binding of acetylated
RelA to full-length Brd4 in an in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay. Consistent with our
previous findings (21), the interaction between RelA and Brd4 was enhanced by the coexpression of p300, which acetylates RelA at lysine-310 (Figure 2B). However, the
interaction was gradually reduced with the addition of increasing amount of JQ1 (Figure
2B). Furthermore, when the effect of JQ1 on the interaction between endogenous nuclear
RelA and Brd4 was examined in A549 cells, we found that JQ1 inhibited the interaction of
RelA and Brd4 (Figure 2C). All together these results indicate that JQ1 indeed attenuates the
binding of Brd4 to RelA.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since binding of Brd4 to acetylated RelA is essential for the transcriptional activation of
NF-κB (21), we hypothesized that JQ1, by blocking the interaction between RelA and Brd4,
might suppress the transcriptional activation of NF-κB. In the luciferase assay using 5X-κBLuc or IL-8-Luc luciferase reporter, we observed that JQ1 inhibited TNF-α-stimulated NFκB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2D). Furthermore, when we examined the
effect of JQ1 on TNF-α-induced NF-κB target gene expression, we found that JQ1
compromised TNF-α-induced expression of IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2 mRNA (Figure 2E).
However, TNF-α-induced expression of c-IAP2 was barely affected by JQ1, indicating that
JQ1 selectively inhibits TNF-α-induced NF-κB target gene expression (Figure 2E).
Interestingly, TNF-α-induced expression of c-Jun, which is activated by transcription factor
AP1 but not by NF-κB (35), was not affected by JQ1 (Figure 2F). Collectively, these data
demonstrate that JQ1 specifically inhibits the transcriptional activation of a subset of NF-κB
target genes.
JQ1 suppresses the tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since constitutively active NF-κB contributes to the proliferation of cancer cells and JQ1
suppresses the activity of NF-κB (Figure 2), we next examined the effect of JQ1 on the
proliferation of A549 lung cancer cells. A549 cells treated with control vehicles alone
exhibited a steady growth over the tested six days (Figure 3A). In contrast, the growth of
A549 cells was reduced in the presence of JQ1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A),
suggesting that JQ1 inhibits the proliferation of A549 cells.
Next, we investigated the effect of JQ1 on the transformation potential of A549 cells by
anchorage-independent growth assay. As expected, A549 cells formed colonies in soft agar
when treated with control vehicles (Figure 3B). Treatment with different concentrations of
JQ1 revealed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the size of the colonies formed from
A549 cells, from a moderate effect with 0.5 μM of JQ1 to a remarkable effect with 10 μM of
JQ1 treatment (Figure 3B). Additionally, we observed a similar inhibitory effect of JQ1 on
the number of the colonies formed from A549 cells (Figure 3C). These data indicate that
JQ1 impairs the transformation potential of A549 cells.

We then evaluated the effect of JQ1 on tumor formation and growth in a nude mouse
xenograft model. Measurable tumors were grown in immune-deficient nude mice after
subcutaneous injection with A549 cells for 2 weeks. A cohort of six mice bearing A549
xenograft were randomized into two groups with approximately equal tumor burden. One
group was treated with daily subcutaneous injection of JQ1 for 32 consecutive days,
whereas the control group was treated with control vehicles only. The A549 xenografts in
mice treated with JQ1 grew significantly more slowly than those in mice treated with control
vehicles after 12 days (Figure 3D). The average weight of the tumors formed from JQ1
treated mice was >60% lower than those treated with control vehicles (Figure 3E). All
together, these data suggest that JQ1 is effective in halting tumor growth, likely by
inhibiting the proliferation of the tumor cells.
Brd4 stabilizes nuclear NF-κB by preventing the ubiquitination of RelA

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In cancer cells, the sustained nuclear expression of NF-κB accounts for constitutively active
NF-κB, which is closely associated with the tumorigenicity of many cancer cells (6–9).
Since Brd4 inhibitor JQ1 inhibits NF-κB activity and suppresses the tumorigenicity of A549
lung cancer cells (Figures 2&3), we hypothesized that Brd4 might play a role in regulating
constitutively active NF-κB. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of downregulation of Brd4 using RNA interference on the levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-κB
in A549 cells. Notably, the decreased expression of Brd4 by Brd4 siRNA in A549 cells was
associated with reduced nuclear but not cytoplasmic levels of RelA (Figure 4A). This downregulation seems to be specific for RelA since knockdown of Brd4 had no effect on the
nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of p50 (Figure 4A).
The reduced nuclear levels of RelA in Brd4 knockdown A549 cells prompted us to
investigate whether Brd4 might regulate RelA stability. We treated the Brd4 knockdown
cells with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, and examined the levels of nuclear RelA.
Treatment with MG-132 reversed the decreased levels of nuclear RelA in Brd4 knockdown
cells (Figure 4B). Additionally, depletion of Brd4 had no effect on the level of RelA mRNA
(Figure 4C), suggesting that Brd4 regulates RelA at the protein level rather than at the
mRNA level and that Brd4 regulates the stability of nuclear RelA.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next examined the effect of Brd4 on the ubiquitination of RelA, an event that is required
for proteasome-mediated degradation. We knocked down the expression of Brd4 and
examined the ubiquitination of nuclear RelA in A549 cells. Nuclear RelA was moderately
ubiquitinated in cells transfected with control siRNA, reflecting a basal level turnover of
nuclear RelA (Figure 4D). However, depletion of Brd4 with Brd4 siRNA enhanced the
ubiquitination of nuclear RelA (Figure 4D), indicating that Brd4 regulates nuclear RelA
ubiquitination. Furthermore, when exogenously expressed Brd4 was examined for its effect
on the ubiquitination of nuclear RelA, we found that Brd4 suppressed the ubiquitination of
RelA (Figure 4E). In contrast, depletion of endogenous Brd4 or overexpression of Brd4 had
not effect on the ubiquitination of p50 (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). Collectively,
these data suggest that Brd4 stabilizes nuclear RelA by inhibiting its ubiquitination.

JQ1 induces the ubiquitination and degradation of nuclear NF-κB

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since JQ1 blocks the interaction between RelA and Brd4 and inhibits transcription activity
of NF-κB (Figures 2), we next determined whether JQ1 might have a similar effect as
knockdown of Brd4. We treated A549 cells with different concentrations of JQ1 at different
time points and examined the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of RelA. The nuclear levels of
RelA decreased with the increased concentration of JQ1 either at 4 hr or 8 hr (Figure 5A).
Similar to the Brd4 knockdown cells, the levels of cytoplasmic RelA were not changed by
JQ1 (Figure 5A). The effect of JQ1 on nuclear RelA appears to be specific since both the
nuclear and the cytoplasmic levels of p50 remained unaltered (Figure 5A). Similarly,
proteasome inhibitor MG-132 reversed the decreased nuclear levels of RelA (Figure 5B) and
the transcription of RelA was not affected by JQ1 (Figure 5C). These data suggest that
reduced levels of RelA in the nucleus is due to proteasome-mediated degradation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Furtehrmore, when we examined the ubiquitination of nuclear RelA in the presence and
absence of JQ1, we observed that JQ1 treatment enhanced the ubiquitination of nuclear
RelA (Figure 5D), indicating that JQ1 promotes RelA ubiquitination. Consistent with the
finding that nuclear p50 levels were not affected by JQ1 (Figure 5A), ubiquitination of p50
was barely affected by JQ1 (Supplementay Figure S3). Collectively, these data demonstrate
that JQ1 induces the ubiquitination and degradation of nuclear RelA.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Constitutively active NF-κB is observed in a variety of cancers and is responsible for many
features of cancer cells (8–10). While signals triggering the activation of NF-κB in cancer
have been intensively studied and elucidated, much less is known about how the activated
NF-κB is maintained in cancer cells. In this study, we have unveiled a mechanism by which
bromodomain-containing factor Brd4 plays an important role in this process. Brd4 stabilizes
nuclear RelA in A549 lung cancer cells by preventing RelA ubiquitination and degradation
through a specific recognition of the acetylated lysine-310 of RelA via its two
bromodomains (Figure 5E). More importantly, inhibiting the specific interaction using small
molecule JQ1 suppresses the transcriptional activation of NF-κB and inhibits the
tumorigenesis of A549 lung cancer cells (Figure 5E). These studies underscore the potential
of targeting posttranslationally modified NF-κB and its associated epigenetic regulators in
the prevention and treatment of cancer.
Emerging evidence suggests that reversible acetylation of the RelA subunit of NF-κB plays
an important role in controlling the functions of NF-κB under physiological and
pathological conditions (11, 15). Acetylation of lysine-310 of RelA facilitates the expression
of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory genes and is involved in bacterial and viral infectioninduced inflammation (15, 36, 37). Additionally, hyperacetylated RelA at lysine-310 is
responsible for Stat3-mediated sustained NF-κB activation in lung cancer (19). Targeting
the acetylation of NF-κB has therefore been proposed as a potential approach for the
treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer (15, 38, 39). Our current structural studies
identified a specific interaction between the acetylated lysine-310 and the highly conserved
asparagines in the two bromodomains of Brd4 (Figures 1A &1B). Mutation of the
asparagines inhibited Brd4’s interaction with acetylated RelA and impaired the coactivation

function of Brd4 for NF-κB (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1E). Consistently, WT but not the RelA
binding-defective mutant Brd4 rescued down-regulated TNF-α-induced transcriptional
activation of NF-κB in Brd4 knockdown cells (Figure 1F and 1G).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The specific interaction between acetylated RelA and Brd4 could be blocked by the small
molecule JQ1, which likely displaces the acetylated lysine-310 RelA from the binding
pocket through its competitive binding to the same asparagines within the bromodomains
(Figure 2). Importantly, JQ1 not only suppressed the transcriptional activation of NF-κB
(Figure 2) but also inhibited the tumorigenic potential of A549 lung cancer cells (Figure 3).
Therefore, in addition to directly targeting the acetylation of RelA, modulating the binding
of effector proteins to acetylated RelA could also be an effective approach for the prevention
and treatment of NF-κB-driven diseases. It has to be noted that JQ1 is an inhibitor targeting
all BET family proteins, which include Brd2, Brd3, Brd4, and a testis specific Brdt (40),
raising the possibility that the inhibitory effect of JQ1 on NF-κB might be derived from its
inhibition on other BET family proteins. However, both Brd2 and Brd3 don’t seem to be
involved in the transcriptional activation of NF-κB since co-expression of Brd2 or Brd3
failed to coactivate transcriptional activity of NF-κB and depletion of Brd2 or Brd3 by
siRNA did not inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-κB target gene expression (Supplementary
Figures S5, S6 and S7). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of JQ1 on NF-κB might reflect its
specific inhibition on Brd4 by blocking its interaction with acetylated lysine-310. Further
supporting this, we found that RelA-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
reconstituted with WT-RelA were much more sensitive to JQ1-mediated cell growth
inhibition compared to cells reconstituted with either vector or RelA-K310R
(Supplementary S4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BET family protein inhibitors, including JQ1 and I-BET, have recently emerged as
promising therapeutic molecules for the treatment of cancers and inflammatory diseases (30,
32, 41). These small molecules bind to bromodomains of BET family proteins and compete
with acetylated-lysine histone peptides (30, 32). The anti-tumor or anti-inflammatory
response activities of these small molecules are ascribed partially to their abilities to displace
the binding of Brd4 from chromatin and suppress the expression of genes involved in these
processes. Oncogene Myc has been identified as the primary target of JQ1 in acute myeloid
leukemia and multiple myeloma (29, 31, 34). JQ1 down-regulates the expression of Myc by
dislocating Brd4 from the promoter of Myc (29, 31, 34). Our studies demonstrate that RelA
is also a direct target of JQ1; JQ1 down-regulated the nuclear levels of RelA (Figure 5A).
However, different from its effect on Myc, JQ1 targets RelA at the protein level rather than
at the transcription level since the transcription of RelA was barely affected by JQ1 (Figure
5C). Consistently, JQ1 induced the degradation of RelA, which was prevented by treatment
with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Figure 5B). It appears that JQ1 might modulate the
properties of different proteins via distinct mechanisms, depending on the functional
consequences of the binding of Brd4 to the acetylated target proteins. Due to their structural
similarities, other BET bromodomain inhibitors might also target RelA and control the
functions of NF-κB through a similar mechanism. A recent study showed that BET-specific
bromodomain inhibitor MS417 inhibited NF-κB activity and NF-κB-mediated inflammatory

response (42). It seems likely that the anti-inflammatory effect of I-BET might also partially
result from suppression of NF-κB activity (32).

Our results demonstrate that depletion of Brd4 or treatment of cells with JQ1 induced the
ubiquitination and degradation of nuclear RelA, but not the cytoplasmic RelA (Figure 4 and
Figure 5). In contrast, the levels of p50 were not affected by the depletion of Brd4 or JQ1
treatment (Figures 4A and 5A). Consistently, the ubiquitination of p50 was not altered
(Supplementary Figures S1–S3). These data suggest that Brd4 or JQ1 specifically targets
RelA. However, it remains unclear how Brd4 prevents the ubiquitination and degradation of
nuclear RelA. It has been shown that acetylation of RelA at lysine-310 prevents Set9mediated methylation of RelA (43), which triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of
chromatin-associated NF-κB (44). Deacetylation of lysine-310 enhances the methylation
and the subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of RelA (43). It is possible that binding of
acetylated lysine-310 to the binding pocket of bromodomains of Brd4 might block the
access of the lysine-310 deacetylases, thus prolonging the acetylation signal and the activity
of NF-κB. Brd4 has been shown to stabilize papillomavirus E2 protein through its direct
interaction with E2 and the blockage of the recruitment of the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex
(45–47). Alternatively, Brd4 might utilize a similar mechanism to stabilize NF-κB. Binding
of Brd4 to acetylated RelA might directly impair the recruitment of the ubiquitination
machinery to NF-κB, which is subject to ubiquitination and degradation after activation (48,
49).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Taken together, our findings indicate that Brd4 plays an essential role in maintaining
constitutively active NF-κB in cancer cells. Depletion of Brd4 or treatment of cancer cells
by JQ1 down-regulates the nuclear levels and activity of NF-κB (Figures 3, 4 &5).
Furthermore, JQ1 suppresses the proliferation and transformation potential of A549 lung
cancer cells (Figure 3). JQ1 also inhibits the proliferation of a variety of cancer cells with
constitutively active NF-κB (Supplementary S8). As such, regulation of the interaction
between RelA and Brd4 by JQ1 or other BETi might be a potential approach for the
treatment of cancer. In many cancers, chemotherapy and radiotherapy induce constitutive
activation of NF-κB, resulting in the resistance of tumors to treatment. Blocking the
interaction between RelA and Brd4 by small molecules might also reduce the resistance to
chemotherapy and radiotherapy and increase the effectiveness of these treatments.
Therefore, identification of Brd4 as a novel regulator of constitutively active NF-κB in
cancer not only provides new insights into the tumor-promoting function of NF-κB in
cancer, but also provides potential approaches for the prevention and treatment of NF-κBdriven cancer by targeting epigenetic regulator Brd4.

Cell lines, recombinant proteins, and plasmids

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Human A549 lung carcinoma cells and HEK293T cells were purchased from ATCC and
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The GST fusion
proteins of GST-BD1/BD2 were prepared as previously described (21). Expression vectors
for Brd4 point mutation constructs were generated using Quickchange site-directed
mutagenesis (Stratagene, San Diego, CA, USA) and all mutations were confirmed by
sequencing.
Antibodies
Antibodies against RelA, p50, HDAC1, Flag, HA, GST, ubiquitin and tubulin were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Anti-Brd4 antibodies were from
Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX, USA). Anti-T7 antibodies were from Covance
(Emeryville, CA, USA). Anti-acetylated lysine-310 antibodies have been previously
described (50).
In vitro protein-protein interaction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Purified recombinant proteins of GST-bromodomains of Brd4 were incubated with biotin
labeled acetylated lysine-310 RelA peptide bound to Streptavidin agarose beads. JQ1 small
molecules were added to the binding buffer to a final concentration of 2 μM. Binding of
RelA to bromodomains of Brd4 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis, luciferase reporter assay and
quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting analysis, luciferase reporter assay, and quantitative
real-time PCR analysis were performed as previously described (21).
In vivo ubiquitination assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HEK293T cells transfected with expression vectors for T7-RelA or T7-p50, HA-ubiquitin or
Brd4 for 48 hr were lysed with a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0; 120 mM NaCl; 0.5%
NP40; and 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) followed by sonication. Before
immunoprecipitation with the anti-T7 antibody-conjugated agaroses, the concentration of
SDS in the binding buffer was diluted to 0.1% with dilution buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH8.0;
250 mM NaCl; 1% NP40; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM PMSF and 1X protease inhibitor cocktails).
The immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. For
ubiquitination of endogenous RelA or p50 in A549 cells, cells were treated with MG-132
(10μM) for 2 hr before lysis of cells. Nuclear RelA or p50 were isolated and subjected to
immunoprecipitation with anti-RelA or p50 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with
anti-ubiquitin antibodies.
Proliferation assay and soft-agar colony formation assay
Proliferation assay and soft-agar assays were performed as previously described (51).
Colony growth was scored after 4 weeks of cell incubation at the normal condition with or
without JQ1 treatment. All the proliferation and colony formation assays presented in this
study were repeated in at least 3 independent experiments.

In vivo tumorigenicity assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Five-week old female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Harlan Laboratories,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) were subcutaneously implanted with A549 cells (5X106) for two
weeks. Mice bearing A549 xenografts were treated with vehicle or JQ1 daily for 32 days
with the dosage of 50mg/kg (mpk). The recipient mice were monitored daily by palpation.
Mice were killed and dissected for tumor evaluation when tumor volume reached 2,000
mm3.

Materials and methods
Protein crystallization and structure determination

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For crystallization, an additional size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 16/60; GE
Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was added at the end of purification. Peptide complexes
were formed by incubation of the recombinant bromodomains with a 5-fold stoichiometric
excess of each peptide for 30 min on ice prior to initiation of crystallization. Crystals of the
bromodomain-peptide complexes were grown using the hanging drop method. Briefly, 1 μl
of the respective bromodomain-peptide complex was mixed with an equal volume of
precipitant solution (for the first bromodomain BD1: 0.2M NaNO3, 20% PEG3350, and for
the second bromodomain BD2: 2.5 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M Tris PH 8.5). Crystals appeared
overnight and reached the maximal size in about 3 days. Crystals of each bromodomainpeptide complex was briefly immersed in the corresponding mother liquor supplemented
with 20% glycerol prior to vitrification by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen.
Selenomethionine labeled BD2 was grown as described (REF) and crystals of SeMet BD2
were grown and manipulated under similar conditions.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All diffraction data were collected at an insertion device synchrotron source (Sector 21 IDD, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Labs, IL) using a Mar 300 CCD detector.
All data were indexed and scaled using the HKL2000 package. Initial crystallographic
phases were determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction methods using crystals
of SeMet BD2. The structures of BD1 and of each of the peptide complexes were
determined by molecular replacement using the refined coordinates of SeMet BD2 as a
search probe. For data from crystals of SeMet BD2, a six-fold redundant data set was
collected to 2.0 Å resolution with an overall Rmerge=0.067 and I/σ(I)=5 in the highest
resolution shell. The heavy atom substructure was determined using HySS and refinement of
heavy atom parameters using Phaser, as implemented in the PHENIX software package,
yielded a Fig. 1 of Merit of 0.513. The resultant experimental map was of exceptional
quality allowing the entire polypeptide chain to be automatically traced using ARP/wARP.
Further manual fitting using XtalView (50) was interspersed with rounds of refinement
using REFMAC5. Cross-validation, using 5% of the data for the calculation of the free R
factor was utilized throughout model building process in order to monitor building bias.
For the peptide complex structure, although clear and continuous density could be observed
for the peptide using initial phases from molecular replacement, the peptides were only built
into the model after the free R factor dropped below 30%. The stereochemistry of the
models was routinely monitored throughout the course of refinement using PROCHECK.

Figure 5. JQ1 induces the ubiquitination and degradation of nuclear RelA

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) JQ1 reduces the nuclear levels of RelA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A549 cells were treated with indicated dose
of JQ1 for 4 or 8 hr. The nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were immunoblotted for the levels of endogenous RelA and Brd4 as
in Figure 4A. (B) MG-132 reverses the JQ1-induced down-regulation of nuclear RelA. A549 cells were treated with 2.5 μM JQ1
for 8 hr, followed by treatment with or without MG-132 (10 μM) for 4 hr. The nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were
immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. (C). JQ1 does not affect the transcription of RelA. A549 cells were treated with 2.5
μM JQ1 for 8 hr before total RNA was extracted. Complementary DNA was synthesized and quantitative real-time PCR was
performed. Levels of RelA mRNA were normalized with the expression of actin. Data represent the average of three
independent experiments +/−SD. (D) JQ1 induces the ubiquitination of nuclear RelA. A549 cells were treated with 10 μM JQ1
for 4 hr followed by treatment with MG-132 (10 μM) for 2 hr to prevent the degradation of RelA. Nuclear extracts were isolated
and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RelA antibodies. RelA immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with antiubiquitin antibodies for the ubiquitination of endogenous nuclear RelA. (E) Schematic model for the binding of Brd4 to
acetylated lysine-310 of RelA to prevent the ubiquitination and degradation of nuclear RelA and the potential role of this
interaction in the maintenance of constitutively active NF-κB and in tumor formation.
