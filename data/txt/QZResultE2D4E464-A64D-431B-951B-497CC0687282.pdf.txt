Abstract
Tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (i.e., oxygenation) is a functional imaging endpoint that can reveal
variations in tissue hypoxia, which may be predictive of pathologic response in subjects undergoing neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. In this study, we used diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI) to measure concentrations of
oxyhemoglobin (ctO2Hb), deoxy-hemoglobin (ctHHb), total Hb (ctTHb ¼ ctO2Hb þ ctHHb), and oxygen
saturation (stO2 ¼ ctO2Hb/ctTHb) in tumor and contralateral normal tissue from 41 patients with locally
advanced primary breast cancer. Measurements were acquired before the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Optically derived parameters were analyzed separately and in combination with clinical biomarkers to evaluate
correlations with pathologic response. Discriminant analysis was conducted to determine the ability of optical
and clinical biomarkers to classify subjects into response groups. Twelve (28.6%) of 42 tumors achieved pathologic
complete response (pCR) and 30 (71.4%) were non-pCR. Tumor measurements in pCR subjects had higher stO2
levels (median 77.8%) than those in non-pCR individuals (median 72.3%, P ¼ 0.01). There were no signiﬁcant
differences in baseline ctO2Hb, ctHHb, and ctTHb between response groups. An optimal tumor oxygenation
threshold of stO2 ¼ 76.7% was determined for pCR versus non-pCR (sensitivity ¼ 75.0%, speciﬁcity ¼ 73.3%).
Multivariate discriminant analysis combining estrogen receptor staining and stO2 further improved the
classiﬁcation of pCR versus non-pCR (sensitivity ¼ 100%, speciﬁcity ¼ 85.7%). These results show that elevated
baseline tumor stO2 are correlated with a pCR. Noninvasive DOSI scans combined with histopathology subtyping
may aid in stratiﬁcation of individual patients with breast cancer before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been recommended as a
standard treatment for locally advanced breast cancer and is
currently accepted for patients having operable breast cancer
(1, 2). In the neoadjuvant setting, a pathologic complete
response (pCR) is an important surrogate endpoint, as it is
correlated with a favorable prognosis including longer diseasefree survival and overall survival (OS; refs. 3–5). There is
currently an effort to explore biomarkers associated with the
mechanisms of chemosensitivity and response in breast cancer

to aid in treatment planning and prognosis (6–8). Histologic
markers used to determine tumor grade, proliferation, and
biologic receptor status have been shown to be useful prognostic indicators (9). To date, there are no clinically accepted
prognostic imaging endpoints available before treatment that
can provide insight into the likelihood of an individual patient
responding to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Functional metrics
that quantify tissue oxygen saturation, vascular supply and
drainage, and tumor metabolism have been largely unexplored
in this context and may be closely associated with chemosensitivity and therapy response.
Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI) is a noninvasive functional imaging modality that uses near infrared light
to provide metabolic and hemodynamic information from
thick tissues. DOSI is capable of measuring tissue concentrations (ct) of oxygenated hemoglobin (ctO2Hb), deoxygenated
hemoglobin (ctHHb), water (ctH2O), and lipid (10). These
measurements are directly related to tumor metabolism and
vascular characteristics. For example, high levels of tumor ctO2
Hb are considered to be a surrogate marker for elevated
vascular supply potentially due to angiogenesis. High levels
of ctHHb reﬂect high oxygen consumption and tissue metabolism due to tumor proliferation and/or poor vascular drainage. Total hemoglobin concentration (ctTHb) corresponds to

Tumor Oxygenation and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response

the total blood volume in tumors and has been validated as an
index that corresponds to increased vascular density (11). Low
oxygen saturation [stO2, deﬁned as ctO2Hb/(ctO2Hb þ
ctHHb)] is an indication of tumor hypoxia or necrosis. Several
investigators have reported a relationship between hypoxic
tumors and lower partial pressure of oxygen (pO2; refs. 12–14),
and stO2 has been shown as a surrogate of pO2 by several
studies conducted using erythrocyte-containing phantoms
(15–17).
Previous studies by our group and others have shown that
DOSI and similar techniques are able to localize and characterize functional properties of breast tumors at baseline (18)
and during neoadjuvant treatment (19–22). Signiﬁcant
changes in hemoglobin, water, and lipid over the ﬁrst weeks
of therapy have been shown to correlate with overall pathologic response. All these studies examined the impact of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy on tumor physiology in individual
patients over the course of lengthy regimens.
In this research, we investigate, for the ﬁrst time, the
relationship between baseline tumor properties determined
by DOSI and ﬁnal post-surgical pathologic response. We
hypothesize that DOSI functional measurements before surgery can provide information that correlates with clinical
outcome. This is due to the direct relevance of DOSI-measured
properties on tumor perfusion and metabolism, which, in turn,
impact the delivery and use of chemotherapeutic drugs. Similar
attempts have been made to predict neoadjuvant therapy
response based on imaging endpoints obtained before treatment using MRI (23, 24), diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI;
refs. 25, 26), and molecular imaging techniques, [e.g. positron
emission tomography (PET); refs. 27, 28]. These studies were
designed to assess either pretreatment anatomic features of
tumors (MRI), the diffusion of water in tumor tissue (DW-MRI),
or the uptake of glucose and magnitude of blood ﬂow (18FDGPET and 15O-water). Because DOSI parameters reveal intrinsic
physiologic properties of tumors such as metabolism and
perfusion, they may be broadly applicable to different chemotherapeutic strategies and have the added advantage of not
requiring exogenous contrast agents.
This retrospective study examines 41 primary patients with
breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
enrolled in a University of California, Irvine (Irvine, CA) Institutional Review Board optical imaging clinical protocol over a
period of 7 years. Baseline DOSI measurements show that
pretherapy tumor tissue oxygen saturation, stO2, (also known
as oxygenation) is the single best DOSI-derived predictor of
pCR. In addition, we show that DOSI imaging endpoints can
enhance the use of conventional biomarkers, such as hormone
receptor status, potentially providing new insight for treatment planning and optimization before initiating therapy.

Patients and Methods
DOSI instrumentation
Details of the instrumentation are provided elsewhere (10).
Brieﬂy, DOSI uses near infrared light (650–1,000 nm) from 6
laser diodes and a broadband lamp to determine the optical
scattering and absorption properties of thick tissue such as the

www.aacrjournals.org

breast. Laser diode output is amplitude modulated between 50
and 600 MHz. Amplitude and phase delay of detected signals
are used as inputs into an analytic model of diffuse light
transport to determine tissue scattering and absorption coefﬁcients at the laser wavelengths. A broadband lamp is also used
to illuminate tissue and the detected reﬂectance spectrum is
scaled so that absorption is determined continuously over
the entire spectral range. Absolute tissue concentrations of
ctHbO2, ctHHb, ctH2O, and lipid are calculated by ﬁtting
known absorption spectra from these quantities to the measured absorption spectrum. ctTHb is deﬁned as ctHbO2 þ
ctHHb, and stO2 is ctHbO2/(ctHbO2 þ ctHHb).
A handheld probe is used to acquire measurements in
patients. The probe houses illumination optical ﬁbers that
transport light from the laser diodes and broadband lamp, an
avalanche photodiode detector (APD) that detects laser light,
as well as the distal end of an optical ﬁber that transports
broadband light to a spectrometer. Measurements are conducted by placing the handheld probe on the tissue with light
pressure so that there is adequate optical contact. We have
shown in previous studies that this procedure does not require
compression, does not inﬂuence tissue optical property measurements, and optical contrast is available even from small
(<15 mm) tumors embedded millimeters or centimeters below
the surface of the skin (18, 29).
Patient measurements
This is a retrospective analysis of 41 patients with newly
diagnosed, operative, and primary breast cancer measured
between October 2004 and March 2010. All patients provided
informed consent and participated in this study under a
clinical study approved by institutional review committee of
the University of California, Irvine. Women were excluded if
they were pregnant or were younger than 21 years or older than
75 years. Subjects were included in this analysis if they (i)
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgical resection
of tumors, (ii) were measured with the DOSI system at least 14
days after core biopsy and before neoadjuvant chemotherapy
treatment (average, 31.3 days; 14–110), and (iii) had evaluable
DOSI measurements. Of the 48 subjects measured during the
study period, 6 subjects were determined to be nonevaluable.
Nonevaluable measurements include measurements in which
a laser diode was malfunctioning (n ¼ 3), a subject had an
implant in close proximity to the tumor (n ¼ 1), or when the
tumor was retro-areolar and it was not possible to distinguish
contrast from tumor and contrast from areola (n ¼ 2). One
additional subject was excluded because of a diagnosis of
inﬂammatory breast cancer. All subjects included in the study
were histologically diagnosed with invasive ductal or lobular
carcinoma before neoadjuvant treatment. Age, tumor location,
tumor size, clinical stage, and histologic grading were obtained
from patients' medical records. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Ki67 staining, and c-erbB2 (HER2)
were immunohistochemically assessed in the specimens
obtained by core biopsy.
Patients were measured in a supine position using a handheld probe placed against the breast tissue. Sequential measurements were taken in a rectangular grid pattern marked on

the breast with each point separated by 10 mm. Measurements were taken to include the area of the underlying
tumor as determined by ultrasound and palpation, as well as
a margin of surrounding normal tissue. Contralateral normal
breast measurements were collected from patients with
unilateral breast cancer. A point measurement was acquired
in fewer than 30 seconds and total measurement time varied
between 20 minutes and 1 hour per patient. A detailed video
description of the patient measurement procedure developed for an ongoing American College of Radiology Imaging
Networks (ACRIN) clinical trial (ACRIN 6691) is available
(30).
Mean values of tumor ctO2Hb, ctHHb, ctTHb, and stO2 were
calculated by averaging DOSI measurements taken on breast
tissue corresponding to regions of interest (ROI) using a
previously described method (31). Brieﬂy, ROIs were determined by palpation, mammography, ultrasound, and MRI (if
available) to contain tumor. Tumor locations were additionally
conﬁrmed by an increase in ctHHb and water and a decrease in
lipids measured with DOSI. This combination of chromophore
values, designated as the tissue optical index (TOI), has been
previously shown to be a consistent indicator of tumor location
(32). Optical parameters from contralateral normal breast
tissue were also measured in corresponding mirror image
locations. The measurement procedure and example optical
property maps are shown in Fig. 1.
For the relatively large tumors measured in this study (mean,
3.5 cm in largest dimension), ROIs included at least 3 and
typically 5 discrete measurement points. Each optical parameter value reported is therefore a mean of the approximately 5
values within the ROI, and the SD is a reﬂection of the

physiologic variation for that patient. This contrasts with the
intrinsic instrument precision (relative SD), which has been
well-characterized on the basis of repetitive measurements of
homogeneous tissue phantoms and human breast tissue to less
than 5% for all relevant parameters (29).
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen
Twenty-four (58.5%) of 41 patients received a chemotherapy
regimen that consisted of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) intravenously and cyclophosphamide (AC regimen; 600mg/m2) intravenously every 14 days for 2 to 4 cycles with pegﬁlgrastim
support, depending on clinical response. This treatment was
followed sequentially with paclitaxel or nab-particle paclitaxel
(100 mg/m2), as well as weekly carboplatin [area under the
curve (AUC) ¼ 2] for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest, for 9 to
12 doses. Concurrent trastuzumab therapy was administered
at 4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by a maintenance dose of 2
mg/kg weekly for 10 to 12 cycles in 4 patients with HER2positive tumor. Concurrent bevacizumab therapy was administered at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 5 to 6 doses in 11 patients.
Seventeen (41.5%) patients received a concurrent regimen of
carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel combined with trastuzumab
for 10 to 12 cycles or with bevacizumab for 10 to 12 cycles,
respectively. This was sequentially followed by AC regimens
depending on clinical response.
Histological grading system
The histologic grading system was based on 3 morphologic
features consisting of nuclear pleomorphism of tumor cells,
degree of tumor tubule formation, and mitotic activity (33).
Scores of all 3 components are added together to give the grade,

Figure 1. DOSI measurement procedure and optical property maps. Measurements are taken using a handheld probe that is moved in a grid or line pattern over
tumor and normal breast tissue. Dots indicate measurement locations. In this example, an 6 cm by 7 cm region of tissue was measured containing a
clinical stage II IDC measured to be 27 mm in the greatest dimension. Maps of optical properties are made by interpolating data values between measurement
points. In this example, both deoxyhemoglobin (ctHHb) and oxygen saturation (stO2) are shown. In both maps, which are from identical tissue locations,
the dotted circle indicates the approximate tumor location determined by ultrasound and palpation. This subject was non-pCR. Note the relatively low
oxygen saturation in the tumor region compared with surrounding normal tissue.

score 3 to 7. Grade was classiﬁed into low-grade (III–V) and
high-grade (VI–IX).
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissues obtained for
diagnostic core biopsy were used for this study. Immunohistochemistry was conducted on 5-mm thick tissue sections.
After deparafﬁnation and rehydration, endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked for 10 minutes in a methanol solution that
contained 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase. After antigen retrieval
with 10-minute microwave in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH
6.0), a cooling-off period of 20 minutes preceded the incubation
of the primary antibodies. Brieﬂy, ER antibody (1D5, Dako), PR
antibody (PgR636, Dako), and Ki67 (MIB1, Dako) were readyto-use agents with overnight incubation in a cold room.
All antibodies were detected with the standard streptavidin–biotin complex method with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine as the
chromogen. All stainings were developed with anti-polyvalent,
HRP/DAB detection system and counterstained for 15 minutes
with hematoxylin and eosin. HER2 testing was done according
to the protocol of Herceptest Kit (Dako). Breast cancer tissues
previously determined to have positive results were used as
positive controls.
Evaluation of immunohistochemical biomarkers
Percentage of ER and PR immunostaining was calculated on
the basis of the fraction of positive tumor cells to whole tumor
cells (<5% of nuclei staining, negative; 5%–100% of nuclei
staining, positive). For Ki67, the index was estimated by
counting the percentage of Ki67-positive cell nuclei per a
minimum of 400 cancer cells in areas with the highest mitotic
activity at low-power ﬁelds (40) in representative sections of
the tumors. HER2 status was determined by immunohistochemistry or FISH analysis. Tumors with a score 3þ (entire
circumference of the cell membrane was strongly stained) or
tumors that ampliﬁed Her2/neu gene by FISH were deﬁned as
positive.
Pathological response
All specimens excised from the breast were sectioned into
5-mm-thick slices and were microscopically analyzed for the
presence of residual tumor by a board certiﬁed pathologist.
pCR was deﬁned as microscopic evidence that invasive components of cancer cells had entirely disappeared in all
inspected pathologic specimens. Regional lymph node involvement was not evaluated in this study. The tumors that did not
achieve pCR were considered to be non-pCR.
Surgery
Surgery was planned 3 to 5 weeks after the ﬁnal course of
chemotherapy was delivered. Conservative surgery with lumpectomy or segmentectomy was chosen depending on tumor
size and its location after tumor shrinkage. In patients who
achieved a signiﬁcant response to chemotherapy, an ultrasonographic examination was conducted before surgery to assist
in conﬁrming the location of the lesion. The remaining patients
underwent a modiﬁed radical mastectomy. In all patients,
axillary dissection was conducted.

Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons between response groups were computed using JMP software (Cary). Unpaired 2-sided Student t
tests and the Wilcoxon test were used to compare differences
in tumor values (T), contralateral normal values (N), and
normalized (T-N) values of ctO2Hb, ctHHb, ctTHb, stO2 as
well as ER staining, PR staining, Ki67 staining, and tumor size
between pCR and non-pCR groups. Fisher exact test was used
to compare HER2 status and grade between response groups.
P values <0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.
Discriminant analysis was conducted using MATLAB
(MathWorks). Two classiﬁcation algorithms were used, a
linear classiﬁer based on Bayesian parameter estimation,
which assumed multivariate normal densities and equal covariances for each group, and a ordinal logistic regression
model, which does not assume the data are normally distributed. A priori probabilities for the linear discriminant classiﬁer
were based on the relative proportion of each group. Five-fold
cross-validation was used for all classiﬁers to mitigate potential overperformance in this relatively small data set. Receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed using
computed posterior probabilities calculated from the classiﬁers. The AUC of the ROC curve was used as an overall
performance metric for the classiﬁer. Sensitivity, speciﬁcity,
negative predictive values, and positive predictive values were
also reported at the optimal threshold or Q-point. The Q-point
is the operating point on the ROC curve that has the minimum
geometric distance from the upper left hand corner of the plot.
For multivariate discrimination analysis, AUCs were compared
from classiﬁers using all possible combinations (2 at a time) of
the following features: ctO2Hb, ctHHb, ctTHb, stO2, ER staining, PR staining, Ki67 staining, and tumor size.
A 1-way ANOVA was conducted to estimate the inter- and
intratumor variance for each optical parameter, and the F test
was applied to test the null hypothesis of no difference between
these variances.

Results
Baseline characteristics of tumors
Forty-one patients were measured in this study. One patient
had bilateral disease so a total of 42 tumors were evaluated for
this study. There was at least a 14-day interval (average, 31.3
days; 14–110) between the diagnostic core biopsy and the
baseline DOSI measurements before the beginning of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The average number of days between
the baseline DOSI measurement and the ﬁrst infusion was 11.7
 10.7 days. Table 1 displays subject and tumor characteristics.
Twelve (28.6%) tumors achieved pCR and 30 (71.4%) tumors
were deﬁned as non-pCR. pCR rate did not differ between
subjects who received chemotherapy alone and those who
received monoclonal antibody combination regimens (P ¼ 0.4;
Student t test).

well as tumor size, ER staining, PR staining, Ki67 staining,
tumor grade, and HER2 status for both the pCR and non-pCR
groups. The stO2-T measured in subjects achieving pCR was
higher than non-pCR (median, 77.8% vs. 72.3%; P ¼ 0.02,
Student t test; P ¼ 0.01, Wilcoxon). There were no signiﬁcant
differences between response groups for the optical parameters ctO2Hb-T (P ¼ 0.4, Student t test; P ¼ 0.3, Wilcoxon),
ctHHb (P ¼ 0.2, Student t test; P ¼ 0.3, Wilcoxon), and ctTHb
(P ¼ 0.7, Student t test; P ¼ 0.5, Wilcoxon).
There were signiﬁcant differences between response groups
in ER (P < 0.0001, Student t test; P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon), PR (P ¼
0.01, Student t test; P ¼ 0.002, Wilcoxon), Ki67 (P ¼ 0.005,
Student t test; P ¼ 0.02, Wilcoxon), and HER2 status (P ¼ 0.04,
Fisher exact test). Tumor size and grade were not signiﬁcantly
different between response groups (P ¼ 0.3, Student t test;
P ¼ 0.1, Wilcoxon for tumor size; P ¼ 0.2, Fisher exact test for
tumor grade).
Figure 2 shows box-and-whisker plots of stO2 levels in pCR
and non-pCR in both tumor and contralateral normal tissue. As
described above, stO2-T measurements were signiﬁcantly
higher in tumor tissue measured in subjects achieving pCR
than non-pCR (P ¼ 0.02, Student t test; P ¼ 0.01, Wilcoxon).
The stO2 measurements from contralateral normal tissue did
not show signiﬁcant differences between pCR and non-pCR
response groups (median, 77.4% vs. 77.5%; P ¼ 0.97, Student t
test; P ¼ 0.98, Wilcoxon). When stO2 measured in normal tissue
was subtracted from stO2 measured in paired tumor tissue
(stO2-T-N), no statistical differences were detected between
pCR and non-pCR groups (median, 0.3% vs. 3.22%; P ¼ 0.06,
Student t test; P ¼ 0.05, Wilcoxon).
The stO2-T levels in pCR and non-pCR tumors were stratiﬁed
by either chemotherapy alone, trastuzumab combined with
chemotherapy, or bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy.
There were signiﬁcant differences between tumor stO2 in the
pCR and non-pCR groups when chemotherapy was used alone
using t tests but not with the Wilcoxon test (median, 80.5% vs.
76.1%, P ¼ 0.05, Student t test; P ¼ 0.06, Wilcoxon). Although
not signiﬁcant, the same trend occurred when chemotherapy
was combined with trastuzumab (median, 77.4% vs. 71.7%; P ¼
0.2, Student t test; P ¼ 0.3, Wilcoxon). There was an insufﬁcient
number of tumors treated with bevacizumab that achieved
pCR (n ¼ 3) to statistically compare stO2 values in this
treatment subgroup.
It is of note that the mean intratumor variation was significantly lower than the intertumor variation for stO2, ctO2Hb,
ctHHb, ctTHb, and TOI. Model-based estimates of the interand intratumor SDs and the P values for the F test with 41
and 186 degrees of freedom are as follows: stO2 (16.4, 3.2,
P < 0.0001), ctO2Hb (20.5, 7.4, P < 00001), ctHHb (6.7, 1.4,
P < 0.0001), ctTHb (24.9, 7.8, P < 0.0001), and TOI (7.8, 2.6,
P < 0.0001).
Discriminant analysis
Performance of the linear discriminant classiﬁer and the
ordinal logistic classiﬁer were compared and the AUC values
for both classiﬁers are shown in Table 3. Because the difference
between the models did not change the outcome or our
conclusions, thresholds, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive

This combination provides an 11.8% increase in AUC over
using ER staining alone and a 30.3% increase over stO2-T
alone. Table 3 also shows the highest performing combinations
of optical and clinical biomarkers for each biomarker. Other
combinations that achieved a high classiﬁcation accuracy
included ER and BRS grade (AUC, 0.897), ER and ctHHb (AUC,
0.871), and ER and ctO2Hb (AUC, 0.859).
Statistical signiﬁcance between ROC curves was determined
using the methods described in the work of Vergara and
colleagues (34). Posterior probabilities output from the discriminant analysis for the predictors of ctO2Hb, ctHHb, ctTHb,
stO2, ER, PR, tumor size, stO2 þ ER, stO2 þ PR, and stO2 þ
tumor size were used as inputs for the comparison. The
method requires sample sizes for each predictor to be equivalent and 2 data points were removed from several of the
predictors to meet this criterion. Ki67 was not compared with
the other predictors, as only 30 samples were available. The
combination of stO2 þ ER was statistically different (P < 0.05)
from all other predictors except for ER (P ¼ 0.23) implying that
this combination provides information not available from the
other predictors.

Discussion
In this retrospective analysis of 41 patients measured over a
period of 7 years using a standardized optical imaging technology, we observed that patients who exhibited a pCR to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy had higher tumor tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (stO2) values than non-pCR subjects. In
addition, tumor stO2 levels measured in subjects achieving pCR
were similar or higher than levels measured in paired normal
tissue. In contrast, non-pCR tumors had lower stO2 than in
normal tissue. Finally, stO2 levels were not different between

4324

Cancer Res; 72(17) September 1, 2012

response groups in contralateral normal breast tissue. These
ﬁndings support the idea that pCR and non-pCR tumors have
differential oxygen delivery and use. These results highlight the
potential use of DOSI measurements for understanding in vivo
tumor biology and represent one of the ﬁrst applications of
functional imaging for chemotherapy response prediction
using baseline measurements alone.
Discriminant analyses revealed the signiﬁcance of tumor
stO2 as a prognostic indicator of chemotherapy responsiveness. ROC analysis showed that tumor stO2 alone was sufﬁcient
to separate pCR from non-pCR response groups (AUC, 0.733)
with comparable accuracy to established predictive markers
such as ER (AUC, 0.854), PR (AUC, 0.707), Ki67 (AUC, 0.672), and
tumor size (AUC, 0.607). A sensitivity of 75.0% and speciﬁcity of
73.3% was shown for the classiﬁcation of pCR using an optimal
stO2 threshold of 76.7%.
We also explored the prognostic capability of more traditional biomarkers to predict pCR alone and in combination
with optical markers. In conﬁrmation of well-established
trends, we observed that lower hormone receptor expression
and higher proliferation as measured by Ki67 were both
correlated with pCR (35–37). Furthermore, when stO2 and ER
were used together in a multivariate discriminant analysis,
classiﬁcation of response groups improved (AUC, 0.955). The
combination of stO2 and ER was the best pairing of the
measured parameters. This ﬁnding suggests that the noninvasive optical measurements explored in this study provide
independent prognostic information that may be able to
supplement current standard of care tissue molecular biomarkers. It should be noted that only 2 parameters were tested at a
time for the discriminant analysis due to a relatively small
sample size. This did not allow for control of multiple other
covariates simultaneously. It is also of note that the predictive
value of ER alone in this study was excellent (sensitivity: 92%,
speciﬁcity: 82%) and other studies have reported more modest
correlations with response. For example, in 3 separate studies
of more than 200 subjects receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer with chemotherapy regimens similar to
those in this study, the predictive value of ER negativity was
sensitivity of 88%, speciﬁcity of 50%; sensitivity of 64%, speciﬁcity of 63%; and sensitivity of 90%, speciﬁcity of 61%
(35, 38, 39). The discrepancy is likely due to the small sample
size in this study.
In contrast to our previous work in which we showed a
correlation between normalized baseline oxyhemoglobin
concentration and neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in
a small cohort of patients (n ¼ 11) all receiving the same
drug regimen (19), this study shows that non-normalized
stO2 measurements are of prognostic signiﬁcance in a much
larger group of patients (n ¼ 41) receiving various chemotherapy regimens. Absolute measurements are advantageous, because they do not rely on a choice of a normal
tissue site and could potentially be implemented into clinical practice as a tumor measurement with a clearly deﬁned
saturation threshold (76.7%). Furthermore, we have shown
here that combining optical endpoints with clinical biomarkers signiﬁcantly improves discrimination between responders and nonresponders.

Figure 3. Results of discriminant analyses. A, ROC analysis revealed that the single feature of tumor stO2 (AUC, 0.733) was able to discriminate pCR
from non-pCR response groups with comparable accuracy to established predictive markers such as ER (AUC, 0.854) and Ki67 (AUC, 0.672). When stO2 and
ER were combined in a multivariate discriminant analysis, classiﬁcation of response groups improved further (AUC, 0.955). This was the strongest combination
of any parameters tested. B, the discriminator line indicates the optimal classiﬁcation between pCR and non-pCR groups when stO2 and ER were used
together (sensitivity, 91.7%; speciﬁcity, 96.4%). Note that this plot visually shows the separation of pCR and non-pCR tumors using these parameters; the
results reported in the text were achieved using cross-validation techniques that produced a somewhat lower discrimination accuracy.

The biologic basis for the observed associations between
tumor oxygenation and chemosensitivity are potentially
explained by several factors including the extent and condition
of tumor vasculature, hypoxia, drug delivery, and proliferation/
metabolism (40–42). Elevated levels of stO2 could be an indication of an efﬁcient blood supply to the tumor. This allows for
better delivery of drugs and nutrients necessary to maintain
replication and cell division (13, 43). In addition, in the presence of oxygen, cytotoxic drugs generate free radicals that
damage DNA of cancer cells (44). Differences in stO2 may reveal
differential metabolic pathways between pCR and non-pCR
tumors. Lower stO2 in non-pCR tumors is associated with
hypoxia and subsequent buildup of ctHHb. Higher stO2 in pCR
tumors reﬂects diminished oxygen extraction and tumor cells
that are in a more proliferative state (42). This may signiﬁcantly
enhance chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy, because rapidly proliferating cells are more sensitive to chemotherapy (45). Our data
show that neither baseline ctO2Hb nor ctHHb alone correlate
with response and that a combination of supply and metabolism (stO2) are necessary to explain the differences observed
between pCR and non-pCR tumors.
Our observations broadly concur with the small number of
other studies conducted using PET to correlate metabolic
tumor properties with neoadjuvant chemotherapy response.
For example, Mankoff and colleagues found that a low metabolic rate of 18F-FDG relative to blood ﬂow (measured with
15
O-water PET) was a predictor of complete response (27). It
was hypothesized that this ratio of glucose metabolism to
blood ﬂow represents the efﬁciency of glucose extraction by
tumors and that nonresponding, hypoxic tumors may be
particularly adept at extracting glucose even in the context
of poor delivery. Our observation that nonresponding tumors
have lower stO2 and relatively higher levels of ctHHb is
consistent with the idea that non-pCR tumors are adept at
extracting oxygen even in the presence of poor delivery.

Cancer Res; 72(17) September 1, 2012

Similar trends were shown by Specht and colleagues where
tumors were categorized by molecular subtypes (28).
Although this is the ﬁrst published study that shows a
correlation between breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy
response and baseline tissue oxygen saturation measurements,
it is important to note that caution should be used when
comparing oxygen saturation values derived using different
instruments. Technical details such as the separation between
the source and detector ﬁbers, the mathematical models used
for computing light propagation, whether measurements are
time-dependent, time-independent, or a combination of both,
and the number and selection of optical wavelengths will affect
measurement accuracy and precision. More speciﬁcally, these
factors will determine whether a given device is capable of
adequately resolving light absorption from scattering and
whether physiologic property estimates, including stO2, are
sufﬁciently accurate and reliable to compare different individuals. We have shown that the DOSI technology used in this
study combining multifrequency, frequency-domain photon
migration with spectrally broadband data has high information content and is well-suited for quantitative tissue optical
and physiologic property measurements (46, 47). Interpatient
comparison that uses tissue saturation devices designed for
relative trending measurements may not have similar performance. Because of these challenges, methods to standardize
optical tissue measurements remain an important and ongoing area of investigation.
A single handheld probe design using a ﬁxed source–detector separation (2.8 cm) was used for all measurements in this
study. It is of note that a variety of tumor sizes and depths were
investigated and that relative contributions of tumor and
normal tissue, also known as partial volume effects, are an
inevitable consequence of this type of analysis. DOSI measurements convey a smaller fraction of the optical and functional
properties of deep versus shallow tumors given equivalent

Tumor Oxygenation and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response

optical properties of tumor and surrounding normal tissue,
tumor size, and geometry.
Despite these limitations, stO2 measured with DOSI was a
signiﬁcant predictor of response. Comparable efforts have
been made to assess tumor oxygenation in breast cancer using
invasive microelectrodes and immunohistochemistry to derive
prognostic value from determining tumor hypoxia (13, 48).
Although direct measurements of tumor oxygen tension and
related molecular pathways are desirable, electrodes and
histochemical analyses probe highly localized tissue volumes
and they require multiple insertions and ﬁelds of view, respectively, to adequately sample large tumors. These methods are
susceptible to undersampling errors that can be particularly
challenging in the case of microenvironmental heterogeneity.
Thus, DOSI can potentially provide a noninvasive prognostic
alternative by rapidly measuring global levels of tumor and
normal tissue oxygenation.
In summary, this is the ﬁrst study to report stO2 as a
prognostic functional optical imaging endpoint for breast
cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy before drug administration. When considered in conjunction with previous molecular
imaging studies, these ﬁndings suggest a general framework
for predicting individual response to chemotherapy based on
the need for adequate perfusion and metabolism to support
drug delivery and use, respectively. With continued standardization of the measurement and analysis technology, these
features could be rapidly evaluated in the clinical oncologic
workﬂow and may be relevant for other types of large solid
tumors. Ultimately, the combination of noninvasive functional
imaging endpoints and tissue-speciﬁc biomarkers may provide
a promising strategy for predicting individual patient chemotherapy responsiveness and guiding clinical decision-making.
This information could be used, for example, in subjects
who are likely to be nonresponders where neoadjuvant chemotherapy would offer no beneﬁt and subjects might endure
signiﬁcant side effects. These individuals could immediately
undergo surgical resection with no change in overall outcome.
DOSI may also have use in devising new treatment strategies by
providing oncologists with feedback on drugs that enhance
tumor perfusion before the administration of cytotoxic agents.

FirstScan, Inc. and Volighten, Inc., for different ﬁelds of use, including breast
cancer (FirstScan, Inc.). This research was completed without participation,
knowledge, or ﬁnancial support of either company, and data were acquired and
processed from patients by coauthors unafﬁliated with either entity. The
Institutional Review Board and Conﬂict of Interest Ofﬁce of the University of
California, Irvine, have reviewed both patent and corporate disclosures and did
not ﬁnd any concerns. No potential conﬂicts of interest were disclosed by the
other authors.
