Abstract
Aneuploidy is frequently detected in human cancers and is
implicated in carcinogenesis. Pharmacologic targeting of aneuploidy is an attractive therapeutic strategy, as this would preferentially eliminate malignant over normal cells. We previously
discovered that CDK2 inhibition causes lung cancer cells with
more than two centrosomes to undergo multipolar cell division
leading to apoptosis, deﬁned as anaphase catastrophe. Cells
with activating KRAS mutations were especially sensitive to
CDK2 inhibition. Mechanisms of CDK2-mediated anaphase
catastrophe and how activated KRAS enhances this effect were
investigated. Live-cell imaging provided direct evidence that
following CDK2 inhibition, lung cancer cells develop multipolar anaphase and undergo multipolar cell division with the
resulting progeny apoptotic. The siRNA-mediated repression of
the CDK2 target and centrosome protein CP110 induced ana-

phase catastrophe of lung cancer cells. In contrast, CP110
overexpression antagonized CDK2 inhibitor–mediated anaphase catastrophe. Furthermore, activated KRAS mutations
sensitized lung cancer cells to CDK2 inhibition by deregulating
CP110 expression. Thus, CP110 is a critical mediator of CDK2
inhibition–driven anaphase catastrophe. Independent examination of murine and human paired normal–malignant lung
tissues revealed marked upregulation of CP110 in malignant
versus normal lung. Human lung cancers with KRAS mutations
had signiﬁcantly lower CP110 expression as compared with
KRAS wild-type cancers. Thus, a direct link was found between
CP110 and CDK2 inhibitor antineoplastic response. CP110
plays a mechanistic role in response of lung cancer cells to
CDK2 inhibition, especially in the presence of activated KRAS
mutations. Cancer Res; 75(10); 2029–38. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

E promoting DNA duplication, entry, and progression through
the cell cycle (2). Cyclin E-CDK2 deregulation is frequent in
epithelial carcinogenesis, including in lung cancer, where it is
associated with a poor prognosis (3). Transgenic mouse models
were engineered with surfactant C-targeted cyclin E expression in
the lung (4). This conferred chromosomal instability and lung
cancers in mice with tumors recapitulating key features of human
lung carcinogenesis (4).
Our prior work reported CDK2 inhibition caused anaphase
catastrophe and apoptosis in lung cancer cells (5). Results from a
high-throughput screen system testing the effect of seliciclib in
270 cancer cell lines revealed that in non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) cell lines, the most sensitive lines frequently had activated KRAS, whereas the 15 least sensitive cell lines all had wildtype (WT) KRAS, indicating that KRAS-mutant lung cancer cell
lines are most sensitive to CDK2 inhibition (5). Notably, lung
cancer cases with activated KRAS are chemoresistant and have a
poor prognosis (6). Therapeutic strategies for lung cancers with
KRAS mutations are needed. This study sought to elucidate
mechanistic pathways through which CDK2 inhibition confers
anaphase catastrophe, and how KRAS mutation enhances this
effect.
Anaphase catastrophe is observed in cancers with extra centrosomes that segregate chromosomes with multipolar spindles into
nonviable cells (7, 8). Centrosome ampliﬁcation occurs in diverse
cancers and is associated with chromosome instability, anaphase

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) regulate cell-cycle progression (1). CDK2 is activated by the temporal upregulation of cyclin

catastrophe, aneuploidy, and tumorigenesis (9–13). Agents that
cause anaphase catastrophe, including CDK2 inhibitors, exploit
the fact that cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes can
undergo multipolar cell division, leading to aneuploidy and cell
death (14).
To identify potential mediators of anaphase catastrophe
engaged by CDK2 inhibition, several CDK2 targets were examined. Among them, the centrosomal protein CP110 was highlighted as CP110 knockdown increased anaphase catastrophe in lung
cancer cells. CP110 is a direct target of cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin ACDK2, and cyclin B-CDC2 (15). CP110 has differing roles dependent on cell-cycle phase (15–20). During the G1–S phase, CP110
regulates centrosome duplication and maturation (15, 16), and
during the M phase it is involved in cytokinesis (17). In noncycling cells and cells in G0 phase, CP110 inhibits primary cilia
formation (18, 19). CP110 knockdown prevents centrosome
reduplication in S-phase–arrested cells and induces premature
centrosome separation (15), resulting in tetraploidy and binucleate cells, indicating cytokinesis failure (17).
This study demonstrates in lung cancer cells that CDK2 inhibition causes multipolar anaphase that temporally precedes apoptosis and cell death. We found that CP110 is a mediator of CDK2
inhibitor–conferred anaphase catastrophe. Intriguingly, KRAS
mutations sensitized lung cancers to CDK2 inhibitor–mediated
anaphase catastrophe by deregulating CP110 expression. Translational relevance of these CP110 ﬁndings was established by
comprehensively examining human malignant lung tissue arrays
with an associated clinical database and by investigating lung
cancers from engineered mouse models. Findings presented here
reveal a direct role for CP110 in lung cancer response to CDK2
inhibition, especially when KRAS mutations were detected.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and antibodies
Seliciclib (CYC202, R-roscovitine) was provided by Cyclacel
(stock solution 10 mmol/L in DMSO). Dosages of seliciclib used
in the study (5, 10, and 15mmol/L) are clinically achievable (21),
and biologic effects of seliciclib at those dosages were due to
CDK2 inhibition rather than to CDK7/9 blockade (5). Antibodies
used were: cytochrome C (556432; BD Pharmingen. 1:1,000),
a-tubulin (T6199; Sigma-Aldrich. 1:10,000), CP110 (sc-136629;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:1,000), actin (sc-1615; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:3,000), KRAS (sc-30; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:1,000), Texas Red anti-mouse IgG (HþL;
TI-2000, Vector Laboratories, Inc.), ECL anti-rabbit lgG (NA934V,
GE Healthcare), ECL anti-mouse lgG (NA931V; GE Healthcare),
and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (sc2020; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Pro-Long Gold anti-fade
reagent with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; P36935;
Invitrogen) preserved immunoﬂuorescence.
Cell culture
The murine lung cancer cell line ED-1 was derived and cultured,
as described previously (22). LKR13, 344p, and 393p murine lung
cancer cell lines were provided by others (23). Human lung cancer
cell lines Hop62, A549, H460, and H522 were purchased from the
ATCC and cultured as described previously (22).
Live-cell imaging
Cells plated on coverslips were treated with seliciclib (15
mmol/L) or vehicle for 24 hours before live-cell imaging.

2030 Cancer Res; 75(10) May 15, 2015

Multipolar metaphase cells were individually selected for
time-lapse live-cell imaging, as described previously (8). DIC
images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope and
an Andor cooled CCD camera using a 60  1.4NA oil immersion
objective. For Hop62 cell imaging, 21 z-axis optical sections of 0.5
mm were acquired at 10 minutes intervals for 25 hours.
Following time-lapse imaging, cells were ﬁxed with 3.5%
paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI and a cytochrome Cspeciﬁc antibody. Fluorescent images were acquired using 11 zaxis optical sections of 1.0 mm. Image stacks and full-volume
renderings were performed using Nikon Elements and contrast
enhancement was aided by Adobe Photoshop software. Cytochrome C immunoﬂuorescence images were quantiﬁed by calculating average (mean) of the mean pixel intensity of at least 20
regions of interest (area ¼ 0.8 mm2) within each cell to avoid any
mitochondrial staining and quantify only cytoplasmic cytochrome C. Background levels for each image were subtracted.
Expression plasmids and transient transfection
HA-tagged WT pcDEF3-CP110 (CP110-WT) vector and a
CP110 vector with 8 phosphorylation sites mutated pcDEF3CP110 (CP110-MUT) were generous gifts from others (15).
Logarithmically growing ED-1, LKR13, Hop62, H522, A549, and
H460 cell lines were each transiently transfected using TransITLT1 reagent (Mirus), following the manufacturer's instructions.
Each experiment was independently replicated at least three
times.
Indicated lung cancer cells were transfected with siRNAs using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The siRNAs targeting murine
CP110 (Dharmacon), human or murine CDK2 (IDT) and human
or murine KRAS (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) species and RISC
control siRNA (Dharmacon, IDT and Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
were purchased and validated for effects of each knockdown by
immunblot and qPCR assays. siRNA sequences appear in Supplementary File. S1. Each experiment was independently replicated at least three times.
Multipolar anaphase assay
Indicated lung cancer cells were ﬁxed in cold methanol and
stained with DAPI and an anti–a-tubulin–speciﬁc antibody and
examined using an Eclipse TE 2000-E microscope (Nikon). Anaphase cells that contained three or more spindle poles were scored
as multipolar. Data were expressed as the percentage of multipolar
versus total anaphase cells.
Generation of stable KRAS transfectants
Logarithmically growing ED-1 cells (3  106) were plated in
each 10-cm tissue culture dish, 24 hours before transfection.
Twelve mg each of the pCGN K-RasG12V, 188L plasmid (Addgene)
with the pPUR expression plasmid (Clontech) or an empty vector
with the pPUR plasmid was individually transfected into ED-1
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Puromycin selection
began 24 hours after transfection. Engineered KRAS overexpression was conﬁrmed by immunoblot analysis.
Proliferation and apoptosis assays
Logarithmically growing cells were plated onto individual 12well tissue culture plates (5  103 cells/well). Twenty-four hours
later, cells were treated with seliciclib over a range of concentrations versus vehicle controls. Three independent wells were

seeded in each experiment with triplicate independent replicates.
Proliferation was measured using the CellTiter-Glo Assay Kit
(Promega), as described previously (24). Trypan blue viability
assays were performed (22). Cellular apoptosis was measured by
Annexin V:PE positivity detected using the Annexin V Assay Kit
(Southern Biotech).
Immunohistochemistry
Thirty lung cancers (17 adenocarcinoma, eight squamous cell,
and ﬁve other histologies) from the New Hampshire State Cancer
Registry and Dartmouth Tumor Registry in addition to lung cancer
specimens obtained from Dartmouth's Department of Pathology
archives were used in paired normal and malignant lung tissue
microarrays. This study was reviewed and approved by the Dartmouth Committee for Protection of Human Subjects.
A larger set of tissue microarrays was from a lung cancer tissue
bank at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. The Institutional Review
Board approved these studies of 558 surgically resected NSCLC
(369 adenocarcinomas, 176 squamous cell carcinomas, 13 histology information not available).
IHC was performed on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded sections using a Leica BOND-MAX automated stainer (Leica Microsystems Inc.) and Leica Bond Polymer Reﬁne Detection reagents
to detect CP110 protein. Antibody speciﬁcity was conﬁrmed using
a blocking peptide (sc-136629; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.).
The IHC scoring system was similar to prior work (22, 25). CP110
immunohistochemical expression was scored by a reference
pathologist who was unaware of clinical ﬁndings. Both average
staining intensity and percentages of immunoreactive cancer cells
were recorded.
CP110 imunohistochemical analyses were independently performed in paired normal–malignant lung tissues from cyclin E as
well as KRAS-driven lung cancers in engineered mouse models
(4, 26).
Immunoblot analyses
Cells were lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors (BD Biosciences), and immunoblot analyses performed as
previously described (27). Lysates were size-fractionated by SDSPAGE before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher
and Schuell Bioscience) and probing with indicated antibodies.
Real-time reverse transcription PCR assays
Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNA Easy Kit
(Invitrogen). Reverse transcription (RT) was done using the High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems)
with a Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research). Quantitative realtime PCR assays were done using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) and the 7500 Fast Real time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems) for quantitation. RT-PCR assays were conducted following the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). Three replicate experiments were done. Primers sequences
appear in Supplementary File S1.
Statistical analyses
Results of independent experiments were pooled to assess
statistical signiﬁcance. Two-tailed t tests were used. Statistical
signiﬁcance was noted with  , P < 0.05 and  , P < 0.01.

Results
Live-cell imaging after CDK2 inhibition
Prior work established CDK2 inhibition caused anaphase
catastrophe in lung cancer cells (5, 7). Although prior work
revealed most progeny of multipolar cell divisions died or arrested
regardless of cell origin (8), direct evidence linking anaphase
catastrophe with induced cell death after CDK2 inhibition in
lung cancer cells remained to be shown. To determine the outcomes of cells undergoing multipolar anaphase, we used live-cell
imaging to follow their fates following CDK2 inhibitor treatment.
A representative Hop62 human lung cancer cell displaying a
multipolar metaphase was selected by DIC imaging and followed
by time lapse microscopy. After 25 hours of imaging (Fig. 1A,
whole video is provided in Supplementary File S2), Hop62 cells
were ﬁxed and stained for cytochrome C and DAPI. Cytoplasmic
cytochrome C was quantiﬁed in progeny. In Fig. 1B, representative
negative and positive control cells appear in the examined ﬁeld.
Compared with these cells, two of the daughter cells had significant cytoplasmic cytochrome C release, as quantiﬁed in Fig. 1C,
indicating apoptosis was initiated. The third daughter cell did not
show a signiﬁcant cytoplasmic cytochrome C signal. However, the
third daughter cell displayed marked DNA fragmentation and
micronuclei, features seen before cell death or senescence (28).
These results provide direct evidence that progeny of lung cancer
cells undergoing multipolar anaphases can undergo apoptosis.
CP110 regulates anaphase catastrophe
Because CP110 regulates centrosome function and is a direct
CDK2 phosphorylation target (15), it was hypothesized CDK2
inhibition induced anaphase catastrophe via CP110. To investigate whether CP110 knockdown caused anaphase catastrophe,
two different siRNAs targeting murine CP110 and a scrambled
control siRNA were each used. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
assays validated knockdown of targeted mRNAs. Marked knockdown of CP110 mRNA was achieved at both 24 and 48 hours
following transfection (Fig. 2A, left). CP110 knockdown significantly increased percentages of cells undergoing multipolar anaphase in murine ED-1 lung cancer cells; overexpression of WT
CP110 abrogated anaphase catastrophe conferred by CP110
knockdown (Fig. 2A, middle).
To investigate whether CP110 knockdown augmented anaphase catastrophe by selicicib-mediated CDK2 inhibition,
CP110-depleted ED-1 murine lung cancer cells were treated with
seliciclib for 24 hours and scored for multipolar anaphase (Fig.
2A, right). CP110 knockdown increased multipolar anaphases
induced by seliciclib treatment in ED-1 cells.
To examine whether increased CP110 levels affected anaphase
catastrophe via CDK2 inhibition, CDK2 activity was repressed,
genetically or pharmacologically, and CP110 was simultaneously
overexpressed in ED-1 cells (Fig. 2B). CP110 overexpression was
conﬁrmed by immunoblot analyses (Supplementary Fig. S1A)
and CDK2 knockdown was validated by real-time quantitative
RT-PCR assays and immunoblot analyses (Fig. 2B, left). Overexpression of CP110 signiﬁcantly antagonized multipolar anaphases induced by either Cdk2 knockdown (Fig. 2B, middle) or
seliciclib treatment (Fig. 2B, right). CP110 overexpression also
signiﬁcantly reduced apoptosis caused by seliciclib treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To examine whether seliciclib treatment affected CP110 expression level, we examined basal levels of CP110 at 24 and 48 hours

Live-cell imaging revealed the fate of cells undergoing multipolar anaphase. A, a representative Hop62 multipolar metaphase cell was selected and ﬁlmed for
25 hours. Hop62 cells were treated with seliciclib (15 mmol/L) for 24 hours before ﬁlming and were in medium with seliciclib (15 mmol/L) during ﬁlming.

after seliciclib treatment. Treatment of seliclcib did not appreciably affect CP110 protein levels in human and murine lung cancer
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E).
To investigate whether CP110 phosphorylation was critical for
protecting cells from undergoing anaphase catastrophe induced
by CDK2 inhibition, a mutant CP110 species with all potential
CDK2 phosphorylation sites transversed to alanines (15) was
transfected into murine lung cancer cells. Mutant CP110 overexpression did not antagonize induction of multipolar anaphase
(Supplementary Fig. S1C) or apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1D)
in ED-1 cells treated with the CKD2 inhibitor seliciclib. Similar
results were observed in LKR13 murine lung cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S2) and A549 human lung cancer cells (data not
shown). Together, these studies indicated that increasing WT
CP110 protein could override CDK2 inhibition and protect cells
from anaphase catastrophe. Cells with lower CP110 levels are
particularly sensitive to CDK2 inhibition.
The working model hypothesized that inhibition of CDK2
decreases CP110 phosphorylation levels, which leads to anaphase
catastrophe. Moreover, activated KRAS can downregulate CP110
basal levels, increase lung cancer cellular response to CDK2
inhibitors (Schematic diagram in Supplementary Fig. S3A).

2032 Cancer Res; 75(10) May 15, 2015

Engineered CP110 overexpression in human lung cancer cells
To investigate whether CP110 overexpression can rescue anaphase catastrophe caused by CDK2 inhibition in human lung
cancer cells, A549, Hop62, H460, and H522 cells were each
engineered with CP110 overexpression (Supplementary Fig.
S3B) before seliciclib treatment (15 mmol/L) for 4, 8, and 24
hours. Induction of multipolar anaphases by CDK2 inhibition
was observed as early as 4 hours after drug treatment of all four cell
lines (Fig. 3A), whereas apoptosis induction did not occur until 24
hours of this treatment (Fig. 3B). CDK2 knockdown was achieved
by independent siRNAs following CP110 overexpression in A549
and Hop62 cell lines. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays validated CDK2 knockdown (Fig. 4A and 4B, left) and multipolar
anaphases were scored 24 hours after transfection (Fig. 4A and B,
right). Consistent with results from murine cells, engineered
CP110 overexpression substantially reduced multipolar anaphases and apoptosis in all examined human lung cancer cell
lines, despite seliciclib treatment or CDK2 knockdown. Engineered gain of WT CP110 expression protected both human and
murine lung cancer cell lines from undergoing anaphase catastrophe and apoptosis induced by pharmacologic inhibition or
genetic knockdown of CDK2.

Right, ED-1 cells overexpressing WT CP110 or an empty vector were treated with indicated seliciclib dosages. ED-1 cells were scored for multipolar anaphases, 24

KRAS sensitizes cancer cells to anaphase catastrophe by
decreasing CP110 levels
To investigate the role of KRAS in seliciclib-mediated cytotoxicity, a KRASG12V expression vector or an empty vector was
independently stably transfected into ED-1 cells. Expression of
oncogenic KRAS was conﬁrmed by immunoblot analyses (Fig.
5A). KRASG12V-transfected ED-1 cells (KRAS-ED-1) exhibited
marked growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S4A), increased
multipolar anaphases (Fig. 5A) and apoptosis (Fig. 5B) after
seliciclib treatment as compared with control transfectants. Thus,
KRAS activation sensitized lung cancer cells to pharmacologic
CDK2 inhibition, as is consistent with previous work (5, 7).
CP110 protein levels were downregulated in KRAS-ED-1 cells,
but CP110 mRNA levels were not appreciably affected as compared with control cells (Fig. 5C). CP110 protein levels were also
lower in 344p, 393p, and LKR13 murine lung cancer cells that
harbor activating KRAS mutations as compared with ED-1 cells
that express WT KRAS (Supplementary Fig. S4C). To further
explore the role of KRAS in regulating CP110 expression, transient
KRAS knockdown was achieved in 344p and Hop62 cells using
siRNAs. Decreased KRAS expression was detected at 48 and 72

www.aacrjournals.org

hours after transfection. Increased CP110 expression was evident
72 hours after transfection for 344p cells and 96 hours after
transfection for Hop62 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4D and
S4E). This delay in a change in CP110 expression implied that
CP110 expression was regulated by targets downstream of KRAS.
To learn whether CP110 overexpression could reverse KRASED-1 cells sensitivity to CDK2 inhibition, WT CP110 was overexpressed in them. This reduced both multipolar anaphases and
apoptosis (Fig. 5D and E). Therefore, KRAS activation repressed
CP110 expression, which enhanced lung cancer cell response to
CDK2 inhibition.
CP110 expression in lung cancers
To investigate whether CP110 was differentially expressed in
human lung cancers with different KRAS mutation status, tumor
histology, size, age, or stage CP110 IHC assays were performed
(Fig. 6A).
In murine lung cancer cell lines driven by KRAS expression

Overexpression of CP110 rescues anaphase catastrophe induced by CDK2 inhibition in human lung cancer cells. A549, Hop62, H460, and H522 human lung
cancer cells overexpressing CP110 were each treated with seliciclib (15 mmol/L) for indicated hours and scored for multipolar anaphase (A) and analyzed for apoptosis
(B) as detected by Annexin V:FITC and 7-aminoactinomycin D staining.

versus malignant lung tissues from KRAS or cyclin E-driven murine
transgenic lung cancers (Supplementary Fig. S5). Notably, the
intensity of CP110 staining was much lower in the KRAS-driven
lung cancers as compared with lung cancers with WT KRAS status.
CP110 expression was higher in human malignant versus
adjacent normal lung tissues (Fig. 6A and 6B). A logistic regression
model using CP110 intensity as a dichotomous outcome (CP110
intensity  200, median) revealed that a larger proportion of
adenocarcinomas with KRAS mutations were low CP110 intensity
as compared with KRAS WT adenocarcinomas (Fig. 6C). However, average CP110 intensity did not show a difference between
KRAS mutant and WT lung tumors (data not shown). No significant differences were observed in CP110 expression in lung
cancer cases when stratiﬁed for survival (Fig. 6D), tumor stage
or age at diagnosis (data not shown).

Discussion
This study revealed that CP110 expression determines the
extent of anaphase catastrophe when CDK2 levels or activity are
inhibited. Reducing CP110 levels promotes anaphase catastrophe
and overexpression of CP110 signiﬁcantly reduces anaphase
catastrophe conferred by genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of
CDK2. Time-lapse live-cell imaging provided direct evidence
demonstrating that anaphase catastrophe results in apoptosis in
human lung cancer cells.
CP110 interacts with distinct protein complexes that regulate
centrosome duplication and separation, chromosome segregation, and cilia formation (16–20). It is not known to have

2034 Cancer Res; 75(10) May 15, 2015

enzymatic activity, but is thought to function structurally to
regulate microtubule growth and centriole length (29). CP110
is a direct target of cyclin E-CDK2 (15); however, functional
consequences of speciﬁc CP110 sites of phosphorylation by
CDK2 are not yet known. Studies presented in Fig. 2 revealed
that CP110 repression caused anaphase catastrophe. The impact
of CP110 on CDK2 inhibition–mediated anaphase catastrophe
was studied further.
Intriguingly, engineered KRAS expression downregulated
CP110 levels in lung cancer cells, which provided an explanation
for the observed enhanced sensitivity of lung cancer cells with
KRAS mutations to CDK2 inhibition (5). KRAS mutations are
linked to centrosome ampliﬁcation (30, 31) and chromosomal
instability (32). The deregulation of CP110 linked to activated
KRAS found here likely contributes to these processes.
CP110 is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues (15). Expression of CP110 changes in the cell cycle and is repressed when cells
enter G0 phase (15). The upregulation of CP110 expression
evident in malignant versus normal lung tissues could reﬂect an
increased proliferation of lung cancer cells or the presence of
inﬂammation because proinﬂammatory cytokines enhance
CP110 expression (33).
High CP110 expression induces centrosome ampliﬁcation
(20), but then delays centrosome separation and promotes centrosome clustering. High CP110 expression should protect cancer
cells with supernumerary centrosomes from undergoing multipolar cell division. High CP110 expression also inhibits primary
cilia formation (18). This contributes to cilia defects in cancer cells
(32). Primary cilia are crucial for signaling pathways through

The biologic relevance of these ﬁndings was conﬁrmed in lung
cancers from engineered mice where KRAS is the driver mutation.
These lung cancers exhibited lower CP110 levels as compared
with lung cancers from mice with WT KRAS (Supplementary Fig.
S5). Clinical relevance was established by determining that a
larger proportion of lung tumors with KRAS mutations were low
CP110 expression as compared with KRAS WT tumors when using
a logistic regression model categorizing tumors into high or low
CP110 intensity (Fig. 6C). This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis
that lung cancers with KRAS mutations are likely to be sensitive to
a CDK2 inhibitor therapeutic strategy. One of the mechanisms
underlying that is low CP110 levels increasing anaphase catastrophe. Although the overall average CP110 levels between KRAS
mutant and WT lung cancers did not show a signiﬁcant difference,
it is possible that the immunohistochemical assay used was not
sufﬁciently sensitive to appreciate subtle differences in CP110
expression.
The effect of KRAS mutations on CP110 expression is likely
complex and other proteins that interact with CP110 could be
affected by KRAS mutations. For instance, CP110 expression is
controlled by two independent ubiquitination pathways,
SCFcyclinF-mediated pathway (20) and NEURL4–HERC2 com-

2036 Cancer Res; 75(10) May 15, 2015

plex–mediated pathway (38). Recently, a centriolar deubiquitinating enzyme, USP33, was found to regulate CP110 expression
by countering cyclin-F–mediated destruction (25).
In summary, this study identiﬁed CP110 as a key mediator of
anaphase catastrophe induced by CDK2 inhibition that temporally
precedes apoptosis. KRAS mutations sensitized lung cancer cells to
seliciclib-mediated CDK2 inhibition, inducing anaphase catastrophe in part by downregulating CP110 levels. The translational
relevance of this ﬁnding is underscored by the fact that CP110 is
frequently overexpressed in NSCLCs and a larger percentage of lung
cancers with KRAS mutation are low CP110 expressing. Taken
together, these ﬁndings indicate a mechanistic link between CP110
expression and KRAS mutation. It is proposed that these species are
important to prioritize selection of a CDK2 inhibitor for the clinical
treatment of KRAS-mutant lung cancers.
