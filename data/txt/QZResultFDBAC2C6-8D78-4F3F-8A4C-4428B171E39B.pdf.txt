BACKGROUND: Proteasome inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors each have activity in various B-cell malignancies
and affect distinct cellular pathways. Their combination has demonstrated synergy in vitro and in mouse models. METHODS: The
authors conducted a single-arm, phase 2 trial of combined temsirolimus and bortezomib in patients with relapsed and refractory
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) using a dosing scheme that was previously tested in multiple myeloma. The patients received
bortezomib and temsirolimus weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 35-day cycle. RESULTS: Of 39 patients who received treatment, 3
achieved a complete response (7.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6%-21%), and 9 had a partial response (PR) (23%; 95% CI,
11%-39%). Thus, the overall response rate (12 of 39 patients) was 31% (95% CI, 17%-48%), and the median progression-free survival was
4.7 months (95% CI, 2.1-7.8 months; 2 months for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [n 5 18], 7.5 months for those with mantle cell lymphoma [n 5 7], and 16.5 months for those with follicular lymphoma [n 5 9]). Two extensively treated patients with diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma achieved a complete response. There were no unexpected toxicities from the combination. CONCLUSIONS:
The current results demonstrate that the combination of a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor and a proteasome inhibitor is
safe and has activity in patients with heavily pretreated B-cell NHL. Further studies with this combination are warranted in specific

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has increased over the past 30 years to approximately 70,800 new cases
per year in the United States.1 Although most patients respond to initial treatment, many relapse, and the overall 5-year
recurrence rate is approximately 50%. Because of this high recurrence rate, there is a need to investigate additional treatment
modalities and novel approaches for patients with relapsed and refractory NHL.
Bortezomib, a small-molecule proteasome inhibitor, has been widely used in both hematologic and solid malignancies. Bortezomib is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for both first-line and subsequent treatment
of multiple myeloma, for first-line treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL. Bortezomib reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome, resulting in its antineoplastic effect through different
mechanisms, such as inhibition of nuclear factor-jB, direct apoptosis, and antiangiogenesis effects.2 Orlowski et al
first described the activity of bortezomib in NHL in a phase 1 study that included patients with relapsed MCL and
relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL).3 Subsequently, several studies have confirmed the single-agent activity of bortezomib, with overall response rates (ORR) in the 30% to 40% range in both relapsed and refractory MCL and indolent

Original Article

Temsirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitor. The protein kinase mTOR is a downstream target of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase–protein
kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway, which, upon activation,
increases messenger RNA translation of proteins like
c-myc, ornithine decarboxylase, cyclin D1, and ribosomal
proteins, which are essential for cell proliferation and survival.9 Inhibition of mTOR leads to decreased translation
of these proteins, resulting in its antineoplastic effect.
Temsirolimus is approved in the United States for the
treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and in the European Union for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and relapsed or refractory MCL. Single-agent
temsirolimus has demonstrated an ORR between 22%
and 40% in relapsed and refractory MCL and between
28% and 50% in other NHL subtypes, such as FL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).10-13
Bortezomib has demonstrated synergy with several
novel agents, including mTOR inhibitors.14 In addition,
the clinical activity and safety of combining bortezomib
with temsirolimus was recently demonstrated by Ghobrial
et al in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.15 By using this weekly dosing scheme as a starting
point, we conducted a phase 2 trial of temsirolimus and
bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell
NHL.

days of enrollment were excluded. Patients who underwent prior autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation
(HCT) were eligible. Patients who had received prior
treatment with either bortezomib or temsirolimus were
eligible as long as they had not previously received both
agents.
Study Design

Patients were enrolled between February of 2011 and
May of 2013. At study initiation, patients received intravenous bortezomib (1.6 mg/m2) weekly on days 1, 8, 15,
and 22 along with intravenous temsirolimus (25 mg)
weekly on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. A cycle was defined as
35 days, and patients received a maximum of 6 cycles.
Because of a relatively high rate of thrombocytopenia,
after patient 14, the protocol was amended, and the
day-29 temsirolimus dose was eliminated.
Response was evaluated every 2 cycles. Positron
emission tomography/computed tomography scans were
used for response assessment for routinely positron emission tomography-avid lymphomas; in other patients, conventional computed tomography scans were used for
response assessment. Unless patients had disease progression or nonresolving, severe toxicities (grade 3-4), a maximum of 6 cycles was administered. Adverse events were
graded at each evaluation and are reported according to
version 4 of the National Cancer Institute’s Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.16

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Statistical Considerations

All investigations in this study were performed in accordance to the ethical principles outlined by the Declaration
of Helsinki. This study was conducted after we received
institutional review board approval from each site.
Patients were consented before inclusion in the study. Eligible patients were aged 18 years with relapsed or refractory NHL. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia were excluded, but
those with small lymphocytic lymphoma or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma were allowed into the study. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
between 0 and 2 was required. Patients who had an absolute neutrophil count <1500/lL or a platelet count
<100,000/lL were excluded (unless the low blood counts
were caused by bone marrow involvement or splenomegaly). Patients with alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of
normal were excluded. The total bilirubin level was
required to be no more than twice the upper limit of normal. Patients who had  grade 2 neuropathy within 14

The primary endpoints were the ORR and progressionfree survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included the
complete response (CR) rate, the duration of response
(DoR), and overall survival (OS).
The study was designed to test the null hypothesis
that the ORR would be 20% versus the alternative hypothesis that it would be 40%. A Simon 2-stage minimax design17 was used with the requirement of an objective response from at least 4 of 17 patients enrolled in the
first stage before continuing the accrual of 20 additional
patients for a final sample of 37 participants. This design
minimized the maximum sample size among all participants in the 2-stage design to a Type I error probability
<.05 and a power >0.85. To allow for a 5% to 10% rate
of subsequently identifying patients as ineligible or not
receiving protocol therapy, in total, 40 patients were
planned.
Binary or categorical data, such as objective
responses and adverse events, have been summarized using
proportions and confidence intervals (CIs), and numerical

and 4 adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of
patients were thrombocytopenia (44%), neutropenia
(26%), gastrointestinal toxicities (15%), lymphopenia
(15%), anemia (13%), infections (11%), and rash/pruritus (13%). Common grade 1 and 2 toxicities were rash,
hyperlipidemia, diarrhea, constipation, and peripheral
neuropathy. There were 4 episodes of grade 2 peripheral
neuropathy and no episodes of grade 3 or 4 peripheral

therapy because of an adverse event.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Disease
Characteristics

Between May 2011 and May 2013, 40 patients with
relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL were enrolled from 10
sites within the Wisconsin Oncology Network. One
patient withdrew consent immediately after enrollment
and was never treated. Therefore, we report results on the
remaining 39 patients. Table 1 summarizes the demographics and baseline disease characteristics for the 39 eligible participants. The median patient age was 68 years,
and 72% of participants were men. NHL subtypes consisted of DLBCL (n 5 18), FL (n 5 9), MCL (n 5 7),
small lymphocytic lymphoma (n 5 3), and marginal zone
lymphoma (n 5 2). Patients had received a median of 4
prior therapies (range, 1-11 prior therapies). Three
patients had previously received with bortezomib, 1 of
whom was refractory to a prior bortezomib-containing
regimen.

Response

Patients received a median of 3 cycles. The ORR was 31%
(95% CI, 17-47.6%;12 of 39 patients); 3 patients
achieved a CR (7.7%), and 9 patients achieved a PR
(23%). Fourteen patients had stable disease (36%), and
11 patients had progressive disease (28%). The DoR is
depicted in Figure 1. The median DoR was 7 months
(95% CI, 5.2-1 months); and it was 11.3 months in
patients with DLBCL, 8.5 months in those with FL, and
5.4 months in those with MCL. PFS is depicted in Figure
2. The median PFS was 4.7 months (95% CI, 2.9-7.8
months); and it was 2 months in patients with DLBCL (n
5 18), 7.5 months in those with MCL (n 5 7), and 16.5
months in those with FL (n 5 9) (Fig. 3). OS is depicted
in Figure 4. The median OS was 14.1 months (95% CI,
5.0-1 months).
Responses according to histologic subtype were as
follows: DLBCL, 3 of 18 patients (16.7%); MCL, 4 of 7
patients (57%); and FL, 5 of 9 patients (56%). There
were no responses among the patients who had small lymphocytic lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma. Even
patients who had stable disease had a PFS benefit. For

other 2 patients, 1 had disease progression, and the other

example, the median PFS for patients with FL and MCL
who had a response of stable disease was 14 months and 6
months, respectively. Among the patients with DLBCL,
although the ORR was low, 2 extensively treated patients
experienced a CR (Fig. 5). Among the patients with
MCL, 4 of 7 patients had an ORR, including 1 CR and 3
PRs. For 1 patient with MCL, a PR served as a bridge to
allogeneic HCT. That patient remained in CR 18 months
after allogenic transplantation. One patient with FL who
previously progressed 1.5 years after autologous HCT
achieved a PR after 6 cycles on protocol. The patient subsequently was observed off therapy for over 1 year yet
continued to exhibit a further response with each subsequent computed tomography scan (Fig. 6). At the last
assessment (13 months after the completion of therapy),
the patient was in near complete remission.
Three patients had previously received treatment
with bortezomib, 1 of whom was refractory to a prior
bortezomib-containing regimen. That patient had a PR to

DISCUSSION
Despite improved outcomes with frontline therapy in
recent years, there remains an unmet need for active regimens against relapsed and refractory NHL. On the basis
of in vitro and mouse model data suggesting synergy
between proteasome inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors, we
undertook a phase 2 trial of bortezomib and temsirolimus
in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL. In
our group of patients with heavily pretreated NHL (who
had received a median of 4 prior therapies), the combination of bortezomib and temsirolimus resulted in an ORR
of 31%, with 3 patients achieving a CR (7.7%) and 9
patients achieving a PR (23%). Compared with the activity of single-agent temsirolimus or single-agent bortezomib, the combination appears to result in improved PFS.
For example, in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL,
the reported median PFS was 5.3 months for single-agent
bortezomib and 4.8 for single-agent temsirolimus.6,12 In
the current study, the combination demonstrated a median PFS of 7.5 months in patients with MCL.
With regard to toxicity, our protocol was amended
to discontinue the day-29 temsirolimus because of a high
rate of thrombocytopenia. After this amendment, the toxicity was manageable, and the most common toxicities
were thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal toxicities, neutropenia, and neuropathy. Some patients required treatment for diarrhea, constipation, or hyperlipidemia. Five
patients were discontinued from the study because of an
adverse event.
Variable response rates among different histologic
subtypes of NHL have been observed with both

bortezomib and temsirolimus when used as single
agents.7,8 Similarly, our study also demonstrated variable
response rates based on the histologic subtype. The
patients who had FL and MCL had higher ORRs compared with those who had DLBCL. However, although
the patients with DLBCL had a low ORR, 2 patients had
dramatic responses after extensive prior treatment, achieving a CR after 2 cycles of therapy. Both of those patients
completed 4 more cycles of protocol therapy and then
maintained remission for 7 months after the completion
of protocol therapy. Presumably, the underlying genetic
heterogeneity of DLBCL19 accounts for the wide variation in responses observed with this regimen. Further
study to identify biomarkers that are predictive of a
response to the temsirolimus and bortezomib regimen
would be very informative and could help to identify
patients who are destined to respond well. For example,
the presence of protein phosphatase 2A predicts the ability
of temsirolimus to resensitize colon cancer to cetuximab.20 With regard to bortezomib, in multiple myeloma
xenograft models, bortezomib resistance was associated
with myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate
(MARCKS), and MARCKS knockdown inhibited tumor
growth and prolonged survival by overcoming bortezomib resistance.21 In the future, correlation of these and
other biomarkers with clinical response may allow for the
identification of patients who will benefit most from this
combination.
One patient with extensively previously treated FL
achieved a PR after 6 cycles on protocol. The patient subsequently continued to exhibit further response (off therapy) for an additional 13 months (see Fig. 6), eventually
achieving a near CR. This observation suggests that temsirolimus/bortezomib may have created an immunomodulatory/antilymphoma effect that persisted even after the
completion of protocol therapy. An immunomodulatory
effect of bortezomib has also been suggested in the allogeneic HCT setting, based on the observation of decreased
incidence of graft-versus-host disease when patients
receive bortezomib after transplantation.22,23
Our data demonstrate that combined bortezomib
and temsirolimus had activity in patients with heavily pretreated NHL, with manageable toxicities. This combination could be explored further in the future by adding
additional agents to the regimen or by replacing bortezomib with newer proteasome inhibitors, such as carfilzomib or ixazomib. Similarly, temsirolimus could be
replaced with other mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus
or everolimus, which have previously been evaluated in
patients with relapsed/refractory NHL.24,25 With the
3470

commercial availability of BTK (Bruton tyrosine kinase)
and PI3K inhibitors, in theory, previous therapy with
such agents could have an impact on response to the temsirolimus plus bortezomib regimen because of some overlap in the signaling pathways affected by these agents.
Although the combination of bortezomib and temsirolimus has not been tested against novel agents for NHL,
such as ibrutinib and idelalisib, or in patients who have
previously received treatment with such agents, the identification of a biomarker that is predictive of response may
allow more effective implementation of this combination.
Further investigation of this or similar combination
regimens in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL is
warranted.
