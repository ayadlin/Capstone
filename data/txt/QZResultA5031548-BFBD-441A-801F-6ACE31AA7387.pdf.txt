BACKGROUND: The outcome of patients with systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) had improved over
the past decade with the addition of monoclonal antibody therapy. Unfortunately, approximately 5% of these patients
still developed a secondary central nervous system (CNS) recurrence followed invariably by rapid death. This rate is
substantially increased in patients with certain high-risk features. Although prophylaxis against CNS recurrence with
either intrathecal or intravenous methotrexate is commonly used for such patients, to the authors’ knowledge, there
is no standard of care. Retrospectively evaluated was the role of high-dose systemic methotrexate combined with
standard cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone with rituximab (R-CHOP) chemotherapy to
decrease CNS recurrence in high-risk patients. METHODS: A total of 65 patients with DLBCL and CNS risk factors
were identified at the study institution between 2000 and 2008 who received intravenous methotrexate as CNS prophylaxis concurrent with standard systemic therapy with curative intent. CNS recurrence rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival were calculated. RESULTS: Patients received a median of 3 cycles of methotrexate at a
dose of 3.5 gm/m2 with leucovorin rescue. The complete response rate was 86%, with 6% partial responses. At a median follow-up of 33 months, there were only 2 CNS recurrences (3%) in this high-risk population. The 3-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 76% and 78%, respectively. Complications associated with methotrexate
therapy included transient renal dysfunction in 7 patients and a delay in systemic chemotherapy in 8 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous methotrexate can be safely administered concurrently with R-CHOP and is associated

The rate of secondary involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in lymphoma varies widely by histology but is

nearly always devastating. CNS dissemination in Burkitt and lymphoblastic lymphomas approaches 30%,1 necessitating
the routine incorporation of intravenous and intrathecal (IT) prophylaxis against secondary CNS disease in the treatment
programs for these histologies. The risk of CNS involvement and subsequent need for prophylaxis are less well described
for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and there is no standard of
care.
DLBCL carries a rate of secondary CNS involvement of approximately 3% to 5%, but the rate is considerably higher
in patients with certain high-risk clinical features present at the time of diagnosis.1-3 These risk factors include the involvement of specific extranodal sites (bone marrow, testes, and paranasal sinuses, as well as perhaps the kidneys, adrenal glands,
liver, and breast).1,4-10 Multivariate risk models have further identified the combination of an elevated lactate

dehydrogenase (LDH) and involvement of 2 extranodal
sites as conferring a risk of CNS recurrence as high as
34%.1,11 A large Norwegian retrospective analysis identified 5 independent risk factors for CNS recurrence: elevated LDH, age >60 years, involvement of >1 extranodal
site, retroperitoneal lymph node involvement, and hypoalbuminemia.3 When >3 of these risk factors were present
at diagnosis, the risk of CNS recurrence exceeded 25%.
The clinical outcome of CNS recurrence in patients with
DLBCL is poor, with rapid morbidity and death within 2
to 5 months.1,3,5
Identification of DLBCL patients at high risk for
subsequent CNS recurrence provides the opportunity to
offer prophylactic therapy at the time of diagnosis. Highdose methotrexate is uniformly included in regimens for
the therapy for Burkitt lymphoma and lymphoblastic
lymphoma and is the most active single agent in the therapy of primary CNS DLBCL. Despite these implications,
to our knowledge there is no clear standard for CNS prophylaxis in high-risk DLBCL patients. IT methotrexate
has been most commonly used historically,12 but evidence
of benefit has been equivocal, with no protective benefit
observed in 2 large randomized controlled treatment trials
of DLBCL.2,11,13-15 By contrast, the combination of systemic and IT methotrexate has demonstrated effective
reduction in CNS recurrence in DLBCL,16 suggesting
that intravenous methotrexate may be primarily responsible for the risk reduction; however, the protective benefit
of intravenous high-dose methotrexate without concurrent IT chemotherapy has never been formally evaluated.
In the current study, we present what to the best of our
knowledge is the first report of high-dose systemic methotrexate combined with standard chemoimmunotherapy to
decrease CNS recurrence in high-risk DLBCL patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We queried our Institutional Review Board-approved
clinicopathologic database, derived from comprehensive
tumor registry data at the Massachusetts General Hospital, for all patients aged 18 years who were diagnosed
with DLBCL between 2000 and 2008. A total of 1283
patients with DLBCL were identified in the database, 65
of whom (5%) met inclusion criteria and are included in
the analysis. Patients were selected for inclusion if they
were treated with curative intent with cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), with
or without rituximab (R-CHOP), plus at least 1 infusion
of systemic intravenous methotrexate at a dose of 3.5 g/m2

for CNS prophylaxis. CHOP and R-CHOP were administered by standard protocol on a 21-day cycle.17 Patients
were not included if they presented with primary DLBCL
of the CNS, or concurrent CNS and systemic involvement by DLBCL at diagnosis. CNS involvement was
determined by neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
examination in symptomatic patients at the discretion of
the treating physician. Patients were not included if their
pathology was consistent with Burkitt lymphoma or highgrade B-cell lymphoma with intermediate features
between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma. All patients
were considered high risk for CNS recurrence based on
published risk models, including involvement of >2
extranodal sites plus an elevated LDH1,18; Hollender 5point criteria3; or high-risk locations including bone marrow, paranasal sinuses, testes, epidural disease, liver, adrenal, renal, or orbit.1,5,6 Discordant bone marrow
involvement by a low-grade lymphoma was not considered an indication for CNS prophylaxis. Progression-free
and overall survival rates with 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) were calculated from date of diagnosis to disease
progression or death, or death, respectively, and were plotted by the method of Kaplan and Meier.

RESULTS
Sixty-five patients met inclusion criteria and were
included in the analysis. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was 60
years (range, 25-79 years), and 63% of patients were
male. The majority of patients had Ann Arbor stage IV
disease (73%). Using the revised International Prognostic
Index (IPI) score, 44 (68%) patients were high risk (score
of 3-5), predicting for a 4-year overall survival rate of
55%.19 One patient had human immunodeficiency virus
infection. LDH was elevated in 73% of patients, and 64
of 65 patients had extranodal involvement of their
DLBCL. Lumbar punctures (LPs) were performed at diagnosis in 19 patients, all of which were negative by cell
counts. Seventeen LPs underwent cytologic examination
and 14 underwent flow cytometry, none of which were
positive for malignant cells, although 2 flow cytometries
were believed to be equivocal due to paucity of cells, and
had negative accompanying cytology and cell count and
are included in the analysis. These LPs were performed at
the discretion of the treating physician. Cytogenetic information was available on 27 patients, 6 of whom had a
BCL2 rearrangement, 3 patients had a c-MYC rearrangement, and 5 had complex karyotypes. Two patients had

CHOP was given for a median of 6 cycles, with 44
patients receiving 6 cycles, 12 receiving 7 to 8 cycles, and
9 receiving 3 to 4 cycles. Methotrexate was administered
to all patients at a dose of 3.5 g/m2 intravenously for a median of 3 cycles (range, 1-8 cycles). Methotrexate was
most commonly administered on Day 15 of alternating
cycles of R-CHOP (ie, with Cycles 2, 4, and 6), as an
inpatient with leucovorin rescue. Four patients received a
single dose of IT methotrexate at the time of diagnostic
LP. Sixteen patients received consolidative involved field
radiotherapy.
The indications for CNS prophylactic therapy are
summarized in Table 2. Most prophylactic therapy was
given to patients with multiple extranodal sites plus an elevated LDH (46%), followed by involvement of bone marrow (22%); epidural disease (22%); a Hollender score of
4 or 5 (17%); and involvement of the kidney or adrenal
gland (14%), orbit (14%), liver (12%), paranasal sinuses
(9%), testes (8%), and breast (2%). Patients frequently
had >1 of the above risk factors present at diagnosis.
The median follow-up is 33 months. Outcome is
summarized in Table 3. The overall systemic response rate
was 92%, with 56 patients (86%) achieving a complete

survival rate was 78% (95% CI, 64-88%) (Fig. 1). Among
all patients with recurrent disease, the median Ki-67 proliferation index of diagnostic biopsy specimens was 70%
(range, 50-90%). Among 11 patients with recurrent systemic disease, the median follow-up is 2 years with 4
patients remaining alive at last follow-up.
CNS recurrence occurred in only 2 patients (at 4
months and 9 months, respectively from diagnosis), yielding a CNS recurrence rate of 3% in this high-risk population. Both patients died of their CNS recurrence at 32
days and 127 days from recurrence, respectively. One
patient had received IT methotrexate at the time of initial
diagnostic LP, which was equivocal by flow cytometry
and negative by cytology and cell count. The other patient
did not have an LP at diagnosis. Both patients received RCHOP. One patient developed disease recurrence during
treatment exclusively in the leptomeninges after receiving
3 cycles of R-CHOP and 1 infusion of systemic methotrexate. The other patient completed 6 cycles of R-CHOP
and 5 infusions of systemic methotrexate, and presented
48 days after completing chemotherapy with CNS recurrence in the brain parenchyma and leptomeninges, as well
as systemic disease recurrence. The indication for CNS
prophylaxis was bone marrow involvement by DLBCL in
both patients. LDH was markedly elevated in both
patients at diagnosis (2764 U/L and 798 U/L; normal
range for our laboratory, 110-210 U/L). Ki-67 staining at
initial diagnosis was available in only one of these patients
and was 70%. Neither patient had a detectable c-MYC
rearrangement.

Toxicity
The median creatinine at baseline was 0.9 mg/dl (range,
0.5-1.7 mg/dl). The median maximal creatinine within 2
weeks of the first methotrexate infusion was 1.1 mg/dl
(range, 0.6-2.8 mg/dl). Twenty-six patients had renal toxicity, defined as an increase in serum creatinine above the
upper limit of normal; 10 of these patients (38%) were
aged 60 years and 16 patients (62%) were aged >60
years. After the first methotrexate infusion, 7 patients had
an elevation in their creatinine to 2.0 mg/dl, 3 of whom
did not receive further methotrexate infusions but subsequently had complete recovery of renal function. One of
these cases of renal failure occurred in the setting of recent
intravenous contrast administration.
Sixty-one patients received a second infusion of
high-dose methotrexate, at which time the baseline creatinine was again 0.9 mg/dl (range, 0.5-1.7 mg/dl). Only 2
patients experienced elevations in their creatinine 2 mg/

dl, both of whom had also had developed creatinine >2
mg/dl after the first methotrexate infusion. Among
patients without renal dysfunction after Cycle 1, there was
no renal dysfunction with Cycle 2.
Fifty-eight patients received a third infusion of highdose methotrexate, with a median baseline creatinine of
0.9 mg/dl (range, 0.6-1.3 mg/dl). Two patients experienced creatinine elevations 2 mg/dl, and received no
further methotrexate. One patient developed a creatinine
of 6 and required temporary hemodialysis with subsequent recovery to dialysis independence. No other patient
in this series required renal replacement therapy. Nineteen
patients received a fourth infusion of high-dose methotrexate, 12 a fifth cycle, 6 a sixth cycle, and 1 a seventh and
eighth cycle. There were no episodes of acute renal failure
during methotrexate cycles 4 to 8. For the entire cohort,
the median end of treatment creatinine was 1.1 mg/dl
(range, 0.6-4.1 mg/dl), with only 2 patients having creatinine 2 mg/dl.
Nine patients (14%) had planned additional methotrexate treatments aborted due to nephrotoxicity. Eight
patients (12%) experienced a delay in R-CHOP because
of methotrexate toxicity. Six patients had delay of 1 cycle,
and 1 patient had 2 cycles delayed. Of the 8 delayed RCHOP cycles, 3 were by 1 week, 3 were by 2 weeks, and 2
were by 3 weeks. Reason for dose delay was renal toxicity
in 4 cycles, mucositis in 2 cycles, cytopenias in 2 cycles,
and both cytopenias and renal dysfunction in 1 cycle. One
patient died during treatment of chemotherapy-related
complications, including nephrotoxicity, mucositis,
pneumonia, and pancytopenia.

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study demonstrate that incorporation of intravenous systemic methotrexate at a dose of
3.5g/m2 into the standard R-CHOP treatment regimen is
associated with decreased CNS recurrence risk compared
with the published outcome in high-risk patients who did
not receive CNS prophylaxis. Our 3-year progression-free
survival rate approaching 80% is particularly encouraging
in a cohort of patients with a preponderance of high-risk
features for systemic disease recurrence, including highrisk IPI scores and high Ki-67 proliferation fractions.
Previous series demonstrate a CNS recurrence risk
of 2% to 8% in patients with DLBCL in general,1-3,5,11
but none of these series were limited to high-risk patients,
among whom the incidence of CNS recurrence is known
to be significantly higher. Specific extranodal sites are

highly associated with an elevated risk of CNS recurrence,
perhaps due to differential expression of integrin or chemokine receptor profiles that allow colonization of these
sites.20 Involvement of the bone marrow, testes, and paranasal sinuses as well as the kidneys, adrenal glands, liver,
bladder, breasts, mediastinum, bone, epidural space, and
peripheral blood have all been associated with an
increased risk of CNS recurrence.1,4-10,21 In addition,
univariate risk factor analysis of patients who develop
CNS recurrence also has identified LDH elevation, the
presence of extranodal sites of disease, age, and B symptoms as conferring an increased risk of CNS recurrence.1,3,18 On multivariate analysis, the presence of an
elevated LDH in concert with the involvement of multiple extranodal sites by DLBCL appears to be the most
strongly predictive clinical algorithm, predicting a CNS
recurrence risk of 17% to 34%.1,5,11 In our series, 30
patients met these criteria, none of whom experienced a
CNS recurrence. Both CNS recurrences in this series
occurred in patients with bone marrow involvement by
their DLBCL, which yields a 9% rate of CNS recurrence
among the 22 total patients with bone marrow involvement at baseline. Involvement of the bone marrow has
been associated with a nearly 20% risk of CNS recurrence,1 although this has not been uniformly observed
across published series. No CNS recurrences were
observed in patients with risk due to other identified highrisk locations including testes, paranasal sinuses, kidneys,
orbit, breast, or epidural space, but the small subset of
patients in each of these groups prevents drawing conclusions regarding the efficacy of systemic methotrexate in
preventing recurrence due to a specific site of high-risk
disease.
It is not routine practice at our institution to perform LPs at the time of DLBCL diagnosis in the absence
of neurologic signs or symptoms; however, 19 of the 65
patients had an LP performed before the initiation of systemic therapy at the discretion of the treating physician.
Sixteen (84%) of these LPs were sent for flow cytometry,
which has been shown to be the more sensitive than cell
counts or cytology in detecting occult CNS involvement
of the CSF.22 Two of the 16 samples sent for flow cytometry were equivocal for the presence of clonal B cells due to
a paucity of cells for analysis; in both of these cases, the cytology was negative. One of the patients with equivocal
flow cytometry results at diagnosis subsequently developed a CNS recurrence.
The majority of CNS recurrences in patients with
DLBCL occur during or shortly after the completion of

induction chemotherapy.3,5 The timing of these recurrences suggests that occult microscopic disease may already be present at the time of diagnosis. Before the
addition of rituximab to chemotherapy regimens, these
recurrences preferentially involved the leptomeninges in
approximately 70% of cases.1,3,23 However, DLBCL of
the testes has consistently demonstrated a unique natural
history with late recurrences and a predilection for the
brain parenchyma.2,7,8 The prominent leptomeningeal
pattern of DLBCL recurrence led to the adoption of IT
prophylactic therapy with methotrexate, with some retrospective analyses suggesting benefit,13,15,18 and others no
benefit.2,11,14
Two prospective controlled trials have randomized
DLBCL patients to therapeutic regimens either containing or not containing prophylactic CNS therapy with IT
methotrexate. Southwest Oncology Group 8516
(SWOG) was a 4-arm randomized trial of front-line therapy in DLBCL that included 2 arms with CNS prophylaxis for patients with bone marrow involvement
(prednisone, procarbazine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, and
methotrexate [ProMACE-CytaBOM] and methotrexate,
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine
[MACOP-B]), and 2 arms without CNS prophylaxis
(CHOP and methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone [mBACOD]). Patients treated with ProMACE-CytaBOM
received consolidative whole-brain radiotherapy to 24
gray (Gy) after chemotherapy if bone marrow was
involved at diagnosis. Patients on the MACOP-B arm
with a positive bone marrow at diagnosis received prophylaxis with IT methotrexate and cytarabine twice weekly
for 6 doses. Both arms also included intravenous methotrexate, but at significantly lower doses than are required
to achieve significant CNS penetration. The overall rate
of CNS recurrence in this trial was 2.8%, with no benefit
noted in patients treated with prophylactic IT therapy or
whole-brain irradiation.2 The RICOVER-60 trial
randomized patients to R-CHOP at 14-day or 21-day
intervals and included IT prophylaxis with methotrexate
for all high-risk patients (22%) defined by disease involvement of the bone marrow, paranasal sinuses, orbits, oral
cavity, tongue, or salivary glands.11 Of the total 1217
patients, 58 (4.8%) experienced a CNS recurrence; however, this rate rose to 34% in those patients with an elevated LDH and at least 2 extranodal sites of involvement.
The incidence of CNS recurrence was not affected by the
incorporation of IT therapy.

4288

The most compelling evidence for effective prophylaxis against CNS recurrence comes from the GELA
LNH 93-5 trial, which randomized patients with aggressive lymphomas and an age-adjusted IPI score of 1 to
either CHOP-21 or the intensive ACVBP regimen.16
The majority of patients (80%) had doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and prednisone
(DLBCL). CHOP patients received no CNS prophylaxis, whereas all ACVBP patients received 4 doses of IT
methotrexate (15 mg), and 2 infusions of intravenous
methotrexate at a dose of 3000 mg/m2 with leucovorin
rescue. The primary outcome of the trial demonstrated
an improved overall survival for ACVBP-treated patients
complicated by a higher treatment-related death rate.
Notably, ACVBP-treated patients experienced significantly fewer CNS recurrences than CHOP patients
(2.7% vs 8%). Although patients in this trial received
both IT and intravenous prophylaxis, the preponderance
of evidence, in conjunction with the SWOG and RICOVER-60 data, suggests that the intravenous methotrexate provided the improvement in efficacy. Our data
validate the hypothesis that effective CNS prophylaxis
can be provided with intravenous methotrexate alone in
a high-risk cohort of DLBCL patients. High-dose methotrexate overcomes multiple potential liabilities of IT
therapy, including uneven distribution within the neuroaxis, and failure to significantly penetrate the brain parenchyma. Lumbar administration of IT methotrexate
results in marked differences in peak levels throughout
the subarachnoid space, and subtherapeutic levels are
common, resulting largely from differences in bulk CSF
movement, choroidal uptake, and drug clearance.24 Intraventricular administration by means of an implantable Ommaya reservoir improves drug distribution
around the brain, but lumbar concentrations remain
lower.24,25 In contrast, intravenous administration of
methotrexate produces therapeutic drug levels that are
evenly distributed throughout the entire subarachnoid
space.24
All but 2 patients in our analysis received rituximabcontaining therapy. The addition of rituximab to standard
CHOP-21 appeared to have no influence on CNS recurrences in the landmark GELA trial of R-CHOP versus
CHOP, with an overall 5% risk of CNS recurrence
reported among elderly patients with DLBCL, regardless
of treatment arm.23 However, when the RICOVER-60
trial compared R-CHOP with CHOP in a dose-dense
manner, there were modestly fewer recurrences in the rituximab-treated patients noted on univariate analysis

(6.9% vs 4.1%), although this was not significant on multivariate analysis. A notable observation in both the GELA
and RICOVER-60 trials was that CNS recurrences in RCHOP-treated patients were predominantly parenchymal, not leptomeningeal, as had been reported before the
introduction of rituximab. This intriguing observation
raises the question of whether small amounts of rituximab
are able to penetrate and protect the leptomeningeal compartment and not the parenchyma. The increase in parenchymal recurrences in modern series further supports the
role of intravenous prophylaxis against CNS recurrence in
combination with rituximab-containing combination
chemotherapy regimens.
We also demonstrate that high-dose methotrexate
with concurrent R-CHOP can be administered safely,
even to elderly patients. Although renal dysfunction may
occur, it is uncommon and almost always self-limited.
Patients with renal impairment at baseline are not candidates for this approach, nor are patients with significant
effusions or ascites, which serve as a reservoir for methotrexate, resulting in extended toxicity. Careful attention to
adequate hydration, alkalinization of the urine, and
leucovorin rescue is critical to safe administration of
intravenous methotrexate, and methotrexate levels and
renal function must be closely followed after drug
administration.
This study is limited by its retrospective nature, but
to the best of our knowledge there are no prospective studies specifically evaluating the optimal method of preventing CNS recurrence in high-risk DLBCL patients.
Patients were selected for inclusion only if they had no evidence of CNS involvement at the time of DLBCL diagnosis. The majority of patients did not have diagnostic LPs,
which is consistent with standard of care when LPs are not
part of routine staging in DLBCL. Patients with diagnostic LPs demonstrating CNS involvement were excluded
from our analysis to focus purely on the question of prophylaxis. It is possible that our CNS recurrence rate was
low, in part, due to a better job of excluding patients with
occult CNS disease than previously published series due
to exclusion of patients with positive flow cytometry of
diagnostic CSF, thus making our data appear more favorable. It is likewise possible that some patients with occult
involvement of their CSF were included in the analysis
because most patients did not undergo diagnostic LP in
this series.
Placing our results in the context of the existing
data, we suggest that systemic intravenous methotrexate at
a dose of 3500 mg/m2 followed by leucovorin rescue be

Cancer

September 15, 2010

adopted for CNS prophylaxis in high-risk patients, and
that IT therapy be considered only for those patients who
cannot tolerate systemic therapy. Further investigation is
necessary to better understand the optimal dose, quantity,
and timing of high-dose systemic methotrexate required
to achieve effective prophylaxis against recurrent CNS disease while minimizing potential toxicities associated with
this therapy and will optimally be investigated in the context of prospective clinical trials.
