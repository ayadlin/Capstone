BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the levels of 15-lipoxygenase 1 (15-LOX-1) and 15-LOX-2 as well as their metabolites
13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HODE) and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE) are significantly reduced in
smokers with non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Furthermore, animal model experiments have indicated that the reduction of
these molecules occurs before the establishment of cigarette smoking carcinogen–induced lung tumors, and this suggests roles in
lung tumorigenesis. However, the functions of these molecules remain unknown in NSCLC. METHODS: NSCLC cells were treated
with exogenous 13(S)-HODE and 15(S)-HETE, and then the ways in which they affected cell function were examined. 15-LOX-1 and
15-LOX-2 were also overexpressed in tumor cells to restore these 2 enzymes to generate endogenous 13(S)-HODE and 15(S)-HETE
before cell function was assessed. RESULTS: The application of exogenous 13(S)-HODE and 15(S)-HETE significantly enhanced the
activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg), inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and activated
caspases 9 and 3. The overexpression of 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 obviously promoted the endogenous levels of 13(S)-HODE and
15(S)-HETE, which were demonstrated to be more effective in the inhibition of NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated
that exogenous or endogenous 13(S)-HODE and 15(S)-HETE can functionally inhibit NSCLC, likely by activating PPARg. The restoration of 15-LOX activity to increase the production of endogenous 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE may offer a novel research direction
for molecular targeting treatment of smoking-related NSCLC. This strategy can potentially avoid side effects associated with the

INTRODUCTION
A number of publications in the past decade have documented that lung cancer cells can express peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor c (PPARc) and that PPARc ligands generally show antitumor effects. The activation of PPARc by its
ligands exerts antineoplastic effects through inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and promotion of
cellular differentiation in lung cancer,1-4 and this indicates that PPARc functions as a potential tumor suppressor and
that ligands of PPARc may represent a promising therapeutic approach for lung cancer. Indeed, an increasing number of
studies have demonstrated the significance of PPARc activation in the inhibition and treatment of lung cancer.2-15
PPARc can be activated by both its endogenous ligands and synthetic ligands. In most studies, synthetic ligands have
been used in either in vitro or in vivo lung cancer treatments.4-13 Among the synthetic ligands, thiazolidinediones, a class
of medications originally used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, have been widely investigated as anti–lung
cancer agents. The administration of thiazolidinediones for anticancer therapy is known to produce some side effects.16

15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE Inhibit Lung Cancer/Li et al

Moreover, recent studies have further shown that the prolonged use of thiazolidinediones is associated with an
increased risk of bladder cancer.17 These adverse effects
have limited the therapeutic application of synthetic
PPARc ligands. The endogenous ligands of PPARc, which
are generated by in vivo metabolism, are generally believed
to be well tolerated and nontoxic at physiological concentrations. Unfortunately, studies have not actively explored
the therapeutic use of these natural endogenous ligands for
the treatment of cancers, including lung cancer.
Some naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs) have been classically proposed as natural
endogenous ligands for PPARc. Because of their lipophilic nature, PUFAs can readily pass through the lipid
bilayer of cells to perform various biological functions.18
Therefore, the modulation of PUFA-derived PPARc
ligands may have a great impact on cell activity, proliferation, and growth. PUFA-derived PPARc ligands are usually metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) or linoleic acid
(LA). There are several publications indicating that
13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HODE) and
15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE) function as endogenous PPARc ligands.20-27 13(S)-HODE is
produced from LA by 15-lipoxygenase 1 (15-LOX-1).
15(S)-HETE is generated from AA mainly by 15-LOX-2
and, to a lesser extent, by 15-LOX-1.
In an earlier study, we demonstrated that the levels
of both of 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE are significantly reduced in human non–small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) and in mouse lung cancer induced by
the tobacco smoke carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone.13,26 The reduction of both endogenous PPARc ligands is supported by corresponding
decreases in their metabolic enzymes 15-LOX-1 and
15-LOX-2 (or 12/15-LOX, a murine ortholog of human
15-LOXs). Importantly, the decreases in both enzymes
and ligands occurs before the establishment of lung cancer,26 and this suggests that they are very likely to function
as tumor suppressors and play roles in lung tumorigenesis.
In this study, we aimed to examine the function of
15-LOX-1, 15-LOX-2, 13(S)-HODE, and 15(S)-HETE
in lung cancer cells and thus verify their roles as tumor
suppressors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

(ELISA) kits were acquired from Assay Design (Ann Arbor,
Mich). All antibodies were provided by Santa Cruz (Santa
Cruz, Calif). Propidium iodide was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Ore). The luciferase assay system was
from Promega (Madison, Wis).
Cell Culture

Human NSCLC cell lines NCI-H23 (adenocarcinoma
cells) and NCI-H460 (large cell lung carcinoma cells)
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. NCI-H23 cells were confirmed to contain a Kras
12 mutation and to be L-dopa decarboxylase–negative,
and NCI-H460 cells were confirmed to contain KrasQ61K/
LKB1mut.
Cell Proliferation Assay

The proliferation of cells was determined with the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT)
assay.12,13 Exponentially growing NCI-H23 and
NCI-H460 cells (7000 cells/100 mL/well) were seeded in
each well of 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates. After
the cells were allowed to attach to the plate overnight, the
medium was removed, and various concentrations of
15(S)-HETE or 13(S)-HODE (100 lL) were added to
the cells. The medium without chemicals was added
as a control. The cells were incubated for 24, 48, and
72 hours. After treatment, 10 lL of MTT (5 mg/mL in
phosphate-buffered saline) was added. The plates were
incubated for 3 hours at 378C in a humidified incubator.
Then, the MTT solution was carefully discarded, and
200 lL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to dissolve the
crystals. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured with a
reference wavelength of 630 nm with an ELISA plate
reader. Cell viability was presented as the percentage of
control culture conditions. The concentrations of the
compound inhibiting cell growth by 50% were determined from cell survival plots.
Plasmid DNA and Transfection

The complementary DNAs for wild-type human 15-LOX-1
and 15-LOX-2 were generous gifts from Professor Alan R.
Brash (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine). The
FuGENE HD transfection reagent was used to transfect
plasmids into cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells transfected with the empty vector were used as
the control.
Reverse Transcription–Polymerase Chain
Reaction and Western Blotting

Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were performed as previously described.13,26

cells were transfected with recombinant 15-LOX-1 or 15-LOX-2 or the control vector plasmid. Cells without transfection served as
controls. Cells were harvested 24 and 48 hours after transfection. 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 messenger RNA was measured by reverse
transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Housekeeping gene GAPDH was used as an internal control (15-LOX-1, 295 bp; 15-LOX-2,
170 bp; and GAPDH, 136 bp). NCI-H23 and NCI-H460 cells were transfected with (B) 15-LOX-2 or (C) 15-LOX-1 expression plasmid for
24 hours and then incubated with 40 lM AA to produce 15(S)-HETE or with 40 lM LA to produce 13(S)-HODE. The production of
15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE was determined in cells transfected with 15-LOX-2 but without the addition of AA and in cells transfected with 15-LOX-1 but without the addition of LA, respectively. The culture supernatant and the cells were also collected 1 and
48 hours after incubation with AA and were analyzed for the formation of 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE as described in the Materials
and Methods section. Assays were repeated 3 times with similar results. The concentrations of 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE are
expressed as nanograms per 106 cells. Data are presented as means and standard deviations for independent triplicate determinations for each treatment. AA indicates arachidonic acid; cDNA, complementary DNA; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

and 13(S)-HODE in these 2 cells, the cells were transfected with 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 expression plasmids, respectively. The cells were then incubated with
LA or AA for 1 hour before the levels of 13(S)-HODE
or 15(S)-HETE were detected by ELISA.13,26,28,29 To
determine whether the levels of 15(S)-HETE and
13(S)-HODE were maintained during the incubation
period in these transfected cells, the levels of these 2
metabolites were also detected in the cells 48 hours after
the incubation.

RESULTS
15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE Inhibit Proliferation

15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE significantly reduced
proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2). The concentration inhibiting cell growth by
50% for 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE was found to be
nearly 40 lM after 48 hours of treatment. 15(S)-HETE
was more powerful in the inhibition of cell proliferation
than 13(S)-HODE among the cells tested. In addition,
NCI-H23 cells were more sensitive to either 15(S)-HETE
or 13(S)-HODE than NCI-H460 cells.

Analysis of Apoptosis

NCI-H23 and NCI-H460 cells (1 3 105 cells/2 mL/well)
were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated overnight so
that they could attach to the plate. Cells were incubated
with 15(S)-HETE (40 lM) and 13(S)-HODE (40 lM)
for 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours. For the apoptosis analysis, the
cells were trypsinized and harvested by centrifugation
and then fixed in cold 70% ethanol. Afterward, the cells
were stained with a propidium iodide/ribonuclease
staining solution (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
Mass) and subjected to a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Apoptotic cells
were identified as the sub-G1 peak of the DNA content
profiles.11-13
Cotransfection and Luciferase Activity Assay

A 15-LOX-1 or 15-LOX-2 vector or an empty vector
(pcDNA3.1) was combined with each of the following
reporter plasmids: the PPARc-responsive reporter plasmid pFATP-(PPRE) 3-tkLuc, the pGL3 basic vector,
and the pGL3 control. The pGL3 basic vector and the
pGL3 control were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The PPARc-responsive reporter plasmid contained a fatty acid transport protein–derived
PPARc response element with a firefly luciferase gene
under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter. The
combination of plasmids was cotransfected into the cells.
The cells were then exposed to a serum-free medium
with or without the corresponding substrate (LA or AA).
Twenty-four hours later, the luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates with luciferase assay reagents from
Promega.
Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed with the Student t test or a 1-way analysis of variance followed by the Student t test. All data are
presented as means and standard deviations. A P value was
considered significant when it was <.05.

15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE Induce Apoptosis

After cells were treated with 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)HODE, the percentage of the cells in the sub-G1 phase,
which represented apoptotic cells,11-13 was quantified.
The proportion of apoptotic cells was expressed as the relative fold change with respect to the control cells without
15(S)-HETE or 13(S)-HODE treatment. In agreement
with the reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis
was observed in cells treated with either 15(S)-HETE or
13(S)-HODE (Fig. 3A,B). The most obvious increase in
apoptosis was detected 72 hours after the treatment.
In comparison with 13(S)-HODE, treatment with
15(S)-HETE induced apoptosis in more cells. NCI-H23
cells were more sensitive to either 15(S)-HETE or
13(S)-HODE than NCI-H460 cells.
To further explore whether caspase activation was
involved in apoptosis induction, Western blotting was used
to measure caspase 3 and caspase 9. In treated NCI-H23
cells, there was a time-dependent reduction of procaspase
3, but there was an increase in cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 3C).
The maximal effect was detected 72 hours after treatment.
In agreement with the change in caspase 3, the activity of
caspase 9 was also increased in the treated NCI-H23 cells
because procaspase 9 was reduced but cleaved caspase 9 was
increased. Similar activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9 was
found in NCI-H460 cells when they were treated with
15(S)-HETE or 13(S)-HODE (Fig. 3D).
Restoration of the Expression and Enzymatic
Activity of 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2

To re-express 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2, 15-LOX-1 and
15-LOX-2 expression plasmids or the empty vector
pcDNA3.11 was transfected into cells. After transfection,
the levels of 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 messenger RNA
were markedly increased (Fig. 1A). To confirm that
15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 enzymes were catalytically
active, the levels of 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE (the
metabolites of 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2) were assayed

measured with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)22,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay, and it is expressed as the percentage of control
culture conditions (no treatment). The data are presented as means and standard deviations of 3 independent experiments with

by ELISA. The bulk of 15(S)-HETE (approximately
35-45 lM) and 13(S)-HODE (approximately 75-125
lM) production was detected after transfection, and this
confirmed that plasmid-driven 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2
expression produced catalytically active enzymes in both
cells (Fig. 1B,C). Significantly increased levels of 15(S)HETE and 13(S)-HODE were also observed 48 hours after incubation, and this suggested that the increased production of 15(S)-HETE or 13(S)-HODE was maintained
in the cells with the overexpression of 15-LOX-1 or
15-LOX-2.
Overexpression of 15-LOX-1 or 15-LOX-2
Induces Apoptosis

Because the cells transfected with 15-LOX-1 and 15LOX-2 were able to produce significantly higher levels of
15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE (Fig. 1B,C), it was
3134

reasonable to ask whether the transfected cells would
more likely be apoptotic than those without transfection.
It was found that in the presence of either LA or AA, apoptosis, as detected by sub-G1 cells, was significantly
increased in cells with 15-LOX overexpression (Fig.
4A,B). However, there was significantly less apoptosis in
the cells transfected with 15-LOX-1 or 15-LOX-2 but
without LA or AA incubation. A significant increase in apoptotic cells was observed as early as 6 hours after incubation with AA in cells with 15-LOX-2 overexpression,
whereas an obvious increase in apoptosis in 15-LOX-1–
transfected cells treated with LA occurred much later (24
hours after incubation). These findings suggest that the
cells are more susceptible to apoptosis induced by 15LOX-2/15 (S)-HETE versus 15-LOX-1/13(S)-HODE.
To confirm the occurrence of apoptosis detected by
the sub-G1 cell population, we determined the levels of

the counting of cells in the sub-G1 phase. The column figures represent the population of apoptotic cells with 15(S)-HETE or 13(S)HODE treatment. The proportion of apoptotic cells was calculated with respect to the Ctl cells without 15(S)-HETE or 13(S)-HODE

cleaved caspase 9 expression in (C) NCI-23 cells and (D) NCI-460 cells treated with 15(S)-HETE or 13(S)-HODE. Probing the blots for
b-tubulin confirmed the equal loading of protein. The columns show the mean values of the relative densitometric levels of procaspase 3, cleaved caspase 3, procaspase 9, and cleaved caspase 9 proteins at different time points.

caspases. The results showed that in comparison with the
control, the levels of procaspase 3 and procaspase 9 were
reduced (Fig. 4C,D). Consistent with the reduction of
procaspase, the levels of cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9
were increased in cells overexpressing 15-LOXs and incubated with LA or AA (Fig. 4E,F). The changes in both caspases were time-dependent. In contrast, without 15LOXs, LA or AA itself did not change the expression of
caspases. These results indicate that caspase 3 and caspase
9 are activated in cells transfected with either 15-LOX-1
or 15-LOX-2 DNA in the presence of LA or AA. Because
such manipulations of cells would significantly enhance
the production of 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE (Fig.
1) and both 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE are known
to induce apoptosis (Fig. 4), the findings suggest that the
3136

transfection of either 15-LOX-2 or 15-LOX-1 in the presence of LA or AA induces apoptosis by producing 15(S)HETE and 13(S)-HODE and that the induced apoptosis
is related to the activation of caspases 3 and 9.

percentages of the control (cells cotransfected with pcDNA3.11 and pFATP-(PPRE) 3-tkLuc). All data are presented as means
and standard deviations of 3 independent replicate determinations. AA indicates arachidonic acid; LA, linoleic acid; 15-LOX, 15-lipoxygenase; PPARg, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g.
The restoration of 15-lipoxygenases increases endogenous 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic
acid, which inhibit cigarette smoking–related non–small cell lung carcinoma by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g. This novel strategy for targeting non–small cell lung carcinoma may avoid side effects associated with synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g ligands.

known to produce increased amounts of 15(S)-HETE or

function as PPARc ligands to activate PPARc.20-26 Therefore, the results for luciferase activity suggest that the
increased PPARc transcriptional activity in cells transfected with 15-LOX-1 or 15-LOX-2 DNA results from
increased levels of 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 metabolites
(15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE).
DISCUSSION
It appears that both 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 can function as either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressing
enzymes according to the cancer type. For example, the
expression of 15-LOX-1 is lost in colorectal cancer, and its
upregulation inhibits cancer growth.22,23 In contrast, the
enhancement of 15-LOX-1 promotes the progression of
hepatocellular carcinoma.30 The expression of 15-LOX-2
is markedly reduced in prostate cancer, and its high expression suppresses tumor growth.21,24 However, enhanced
15-LOX-2 activity contributes to the progression of renal
cancer.31 In NSCLC and particularly smoking-related
NSCLC, we have demonstrated that 15-LOX-1 and
15-LOX-2 as well as their metabolites 13(S)-HODE and
15(S)-HETE are significantly reduced,13,26 and the result
has been confirmed by others.23,32 Significantly, the reduction of 15-LOXs and their metabolites occurs before the
formation of cigarette smoking carcinogen–induced lung
tumors, and this suggests that they play roles in lung
tumorigenesis.26 However, the functions of 15-LOX
metabolites 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE have not
been investigated in cancers.
In this study, we have demonstrated that growth
inhibition and apoptosis induction can be achieved in
NSCLC cells by either direct treatment with 15(S)HETE and 13(S)-HODE or the forced expression of
15-LOX-1 or 15-LOX-2 in the presence of LA or AA. LA
and AA are necessary substrates used by LOX-1 and
15-LOX-2 to produce 13(S)-HODE and 15(S)-HETE,
respectively.20-26 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE significantly inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells in a
time- and dose-dependent manner. In agreement with the
decrease in cell proliferation, apoptosis was increased in
cells treated with 15(S)-HETE or 13(S)-HODE. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the antitumor roles of 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE or 15-LOX1 and 15-LOX-2 in NSCLC cells. In addition to NCIH460 and NCI-H23 cells, we observed similar results in 2
other NSCLC cells (data not shown), and this suggests
that the inhibitory functions of 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)HODE are likely applicable to a wide range of NSCLC
cells.

In this study, apoptosis was determined with subG1 cells and cleaved caspases. Apoptotic cell death can be
caspase-dependent or -independent. To determine the
role of caspases in apoptosis induction, the levels of
caspase 3 and caspase 9 were measured in cells treated
with 15(S)-HETE or 13(S)-HODE. We found that
15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE could significantly activate caspase 3 and caspase 9. The increased activity of
both caspases was reflected by the reduced levels of procaspases 3 and 9 and by the elevated levels of cleaved caspases
3 and 9. Caspase 9 is an initiator caspase implicated in
mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis.33 Activated caspase
9 can directly trigger the release of caspase 3, which serves
as an executor caspase to induce apoptosis. Furthermore,
the activation of caspase 9 functions not only to initiate
the intrinsic caspase cascade but also to amplify the apoptotic signal. Studies have suggested that the activity/level
of caspase 9 is reduced and may function as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC.34,35 Therefore, the fact that 15(S)HETE and 13(S)-HODE are able to activate caspase 9 to
induce tumor cell death appears to reinforce the concept
that the reduction of both plays roles in lung tumorigenesis13,26 because such a reduction can contribute to the
caspase 9 defect in NSCLC.34,35 This finding thus constitutes a pathway by which 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE
work as tumor suppressors in NSCLC. Although we did
not explore in detail how 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE
activate caspase 9, apoptosis induced by 15(S)-HETE is
preceded by a decrease in B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and
Bcl-2 overexpression may protect tumor cells from
15(S)-HETE–induced apoptosis.27 The decrease in antiapoptotic Bcl-2 can enhance proapoptotic Bax and Bak,
which activate caspase 9.33 Furthermore, in our early
studies, we demonstrated that the activation of PPARc
could reduce the expression of Bcl-2 and lead to apoptosis
in NSCLC cells.11,12
The levels of 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 were significantly reduced in NSCLC tissues.13,23,26,32 In agreement
with their low expression, the enzymatic activities of these
2 molecules were markedly decreased. These findings may
suggest that the functions of 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2
are seriously damaged in NSCLC, and this may classify
NSCLC as a member of a 15-LOX–defective tumor
family. The discovery of the defect in 15-LOX-1 and
15-LOX-2 contributes to the understanding of the pathogenesis of NSCLC and provides an opportunity for new
treatments for this tumor. Before the generation of any
potential therapeutic approach, it is necessary to check
whether the restoration of 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 enzymatic activities would correct the problems caused by
3143

their reduction or loss. Our experiments demonstrated
that the forced expression of 15-LOXs could significantly
increase the production of 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2,
inhibit cell proliferation, activate caspases, and induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Thus, our findings have demonstrated that the forced expression of 15-LOXs is effective
in restoring the levels of 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE
and arresting the growth of lung tumors. The results suggest that NSCLC patients may benefit by using agents
that can stimulate the expression of 15-LOXs. In fact,
such an approach has been actively explored in some cancers whose 15-LOXs are damaged.21-24,32
It has been well established that the exogenous
administration of 15(S)-HETE or 13(S)-HODE can activate PPARc,20-24,27 and this finding has been once again
confirmed by this study. Our experiments further demonstrated that the activity of PPARc was much higher in cells
transfected with 15-LOX complementary DNA. Because
the levels of 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE were much
higher in these cells than those without transfection, we
suggest that the increased production of 15(S)-HETE and
13(S)-HODE by the forced expression of 15-LOX-1 and
15-LOX-2 could result in an elevation of PPARc activity
in NSCLC cells.
PPARc is normally or even abundantly expressed in
lung cancer cells.12,13,36 However, it remains unknown
why the activity of PPARc is not matched to the level of
PPARc expression, and frequently if not always, this activity is significantly reduced in lung cancer.11,12,37 The current findings provide a good answer to this question
because a reduction of the 2 major PPARc endogenous
ligands was found in lung cancer. Obviously the reduced
levels of 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE contribute to
the decreased PPARc activity found in NSCLC. The data
provide some solid evidence for the application of PPARc
ligands to treat NSCLC. Previous work has shown that
the synthetic PPARc ligand troglitazone can inhibit the
growth of lung cancer cells in a PPARc-dependent manner in lung cancer cells.11-13 Therefore, the downregulation or lack of PPARc activity may not only contribute to
lung cancer progression but also provide a potential area
for developing novel therapies for lung cancer. Because
the prolonged use of thiazolidinediones is associated
with an increased risk of bladder cancer and other side
effects,16,17 the development of endogenous ligands
15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE for treatments will be
particularly appealing. Therefore, knowing how to promote the levels of 15-LOXs or their metabolites 15(S)HETE and 13(S)-HODE may be the key to developing a
successful treatment for smoking-related NSCLC.

In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report on the antitumor roles of 15(S)-HETE and
13(S)-HODE or 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 in human
NSCLC cells. Our data evidently suggest that strategies
for restoring 15-LOX activity and thus increasing the production of endogenous 15(S)-HETE and 13(S)-HODE,
which are reduced or lost during lung tumorigenesis, may
offer a novel research direction for molecular targeting
treatment and prevention of smoking-related NSCLC.
