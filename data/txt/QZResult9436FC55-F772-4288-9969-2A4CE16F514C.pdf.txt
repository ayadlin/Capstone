ABSTRACT
Nelfinavir is an HIV protease inhibitor being repurposed as an anti-cancer agent
in preclinical models and in small oncology trials, yet the MTD of nelfinavir has not
been determined. Therefore, we conducted a Phase Ia study to establish the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of nelfinavir in subjects with
advanced solid tumors. Adults with refractory cancers were given oral nelfinavir
twice daily with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses. Twenty-eight
subjects were enrolled. Nelfinavir was generally well tolerated. Common adverse
events included diarrhea, anemia, and lymphopenia, which were mostly mild. The
DLT was rapid-onset neutropenia that was reversible. The MTD was established at
3125 mg twice daily. In an expansion cohort at the MTD, one of 11 (9%) evaluable
subjects had a confirmed partial response. This, plus two minor responses, occurred
in subjects with neuroendocrine tumors of the midgut or pancreatic origin. Thirty-six
percent of subjects had stable disease for more than 6 months. In peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, Nelfinavir inhibited AKT and induced markers of ER stress. In
summary, nelfinavir is well tolerated in cancer patients at doses 2.5 times the FDAapproved dose for HIV management and showed preliminary activity in tumors of
neuroendocrine origin.

toxicology and chemistry normally required for New
Molecular Entities, and has successfully delivered drugs
previously approved for non-cancer indications such as
thalidomide [5, 6] into the clinic, and itraconazole [7] and
chloroquine [8] into oncology clinical trials.
We hypothesized that nelfinavir could be
repurposed as an anti-cancer agent because of its
ability to inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
in preclinical studies. Activation of the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway is an important feature in
many cancers, and inhibitors of this pathway
have been developed as anti-cancer drugs [9, 10].
Inhibition of this pathway can induce toxicities such
as dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance
[11–13], all of which are commonly observed in

INTRODUCTION
The success of molecularly targeted agents such as
imatinib, erlotinib and vemurafenib established the era
of personalized medicine in oncology. Yet, for a majority
of cancer patients there remains an urgent need for more
effective, better-tolerated drugs. The rising price of new
oncology drugs [1], and the increasing length and cost
of drug development [2], have caused growing concern
within the government, academia and pharmaceutical
industry. One means of hastening drug development
and reducing costs is to identify new indications for
already approved drugs, referred to as ‘repositioning’
or ‘repurposing’ [3, 4]. Repurposing established drugs
may eliminate the years of pre-clinical pharmacology,

patients treated with HIV protease inhibitors. This
raised the possibility that HIV protease inhibitors
might have unappreciated clinical activity as inhibitors
of this pathway. Secondly, preclinical studies have
shown that nelfinavir has anti-cancer properties.
For example, nelfinavir inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway, inhibits cancer cell proliferation, and induces
endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy and apoptosis
[14] at concentrations that have been observed in
HIV patients.
Given that a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
nelfinavir was never established in early HIV clinical trials
because dose escalation stopped with suppression of HIV
RNA viral load [15, 16], we conducted a Phase Ia, dose
escalation study in subjects with advanced solid tumors to

determine the MTD and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of
nelfinavir in cancer patients.

RESULTS
Twenty-eight subjects with a wide variety of
tumor histologies and tissues of origin were enrolled
between 2007 and 2010 and are included in the
analysis (Table 1). The most common cancers were
colorectal adenocarcinoma (17.9%), small cell lung
cancer (14.3%), non-small cell lung cancer (14.3%),
and neuroendocrine tumor of the midgut or pancreas
(14.3%). Subjects were heavily pre-treated, with
42.9% having received three or more prior systemic

performance status of 1 or 2.
Twenty-four subjects were evaluable for safety,
while four subjects withdrew consent for non-toxicity
related issues prior to completion of cycle 1 and were
replaced. These subjects were considered non-evaluable
for the following reasons: one for progression of disease
(DL2), two due to patient preference (DL1 and DL4,
respectively), and one for protocol deviation (DL4).
The numbers of subjects evaluable for toxicity at each
dose level were: three each at DL1 (1250 mg bid), DL2
(1875 mg bid), DL3 (2500 mg bid), and DL5 (3750 mg
bid), and twelve patients at DL4 (3125 mg bid).

toxicities were observed. The dose-limiting toxicity was
grade 4 neutropenia, which occurred in two of three
patients at dose level 5 (Table 2). Nelfinavir-induced
neutropenia differed from that observed with conventional
cytotoxic chemotherapy in that it was characterized by
rapid onset (≤3 days), followed by rapid recovery after
discontinuation of drug (≤3 days), and a similar rapid
decline with re-challenge. A representative image of
a subject’s peripheral blood smear that experienced
nelfinavir-induced neutropenia (with acanthocytosis) is
shown in Figure 1.
The most common treatment-related adverse
events (AE) observed in cycle 1 included diarrhea (50%),
anemia (41.7%), lymphopenia (41.7%), fatigue (20.8%),
and hypoalbuminemia (20.8%) (Table 2). Rates of AEs
attributable to nelfinavir increased with dose escalation,
but clinically significant grade 3 or 4 AEs were rare.
Grade 3 to 4 AEs of interest include two cases of grade 4
neutropenia at DL5, one case of grade 3 diarrhea at DL4,

Safety
Subjects evaluable for toxicity (n=24) received 119
courses at five different dose levels. The median number
of cycles was 2 (range 1–35 cycles). No cumulative

and a grade 3 hypothyroidism at DL2. The hypothyroid
event was due to an interaction between nelfinavir and
levothyroxine, which has also been reported in HIV
patients taking protease inhibitors and thyroid replacement
therapy [17]. Following this event, the protocol was
amended to extend the interval between administration of
nelfinavir and levothyroxine to at least three hours apart,
and no further hypothyroid events were noted in patients
taking thyroid replacement therapy.

was evaluable for 19 subjects. A significant decrease
in midazolam clearance was observed on day 20, as
compared to pre-nelfinavir (p<0.001; Figure 2C).
Similarly, a significant increase in exposure and half-life
were noted (p<0.05 for each; data not shown).

Pharmacodynamics
Surrogate biomarkers in PBMCs collected at
baseline, D7 and D42 were analyzed by immunoblotting.
These biomarkers included evaluation of Akt activation
(P-Akt S473) and markers of ER stress (P-EIF2 alpha
S51, ATF3 or CHOP). There were no biomarker changes
noted in PBMCs collected from subjects at baseline to
either DL1 or DL2. Samples from 1 out of 3 subjects in
DL3 showed a decrease in P-AKT S473 or an increase
in EIF2 alpha S51 phosphorylation. At DL4, 45% of
subject PBMCs taken after 7 or 42 days of nelfinavir
treatment showed a decrease in P-AKT S473 and the
same percentage showed an increase in P-EIF2 alpha
S51, indicative of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In
addition, 27% of samples showed an increase in ATF3
and/or CHOP, also suggestive of ER stress. Within DL4, 3
subjects showed changes in 3 of 4 biomarkers evaluated,
two examples of which are shown (Figure 3). The rest
of the PBMC samples from DL4 subjects showed either
change in a single biomarker, or no change from baseline
in the 4 biomarkers evaluated.

Pharmacokinetics
First dose nelfinavir pharmacokinetics were
evaluable in 26 subjects across five dose levels, ranging
from 1250 to 3750 mg (Supplemental table 1). Nonlinear pharmacokinetics were observed following the
first dose of oral nelfinavir (Figure 2A). No increase
in overall nelfinavir exposure or maximal plasma
concentration was seen at doses in excess of 1875 mg.
However, variability in exposure was substantially
higher at higher dose levels.
Steady state (C2D1) nelfinavir pharmacokinetics
were evaluable for 17 subjects (Supplemental Table 2). No
significant association between dose and Cmax, Cmin and
AUC was observed (p=0.09 to 0.63) (Figure 2B), further
exemplifying the non-linear pharmacokinetics of this
agent. Nonetheless, there was a trend towards increasing
trough concentrations (regardless of morning or evening)
with increasing dose.
The pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a phenotyping
probe for CYP3A4 activity, were evaluated prior to the
start of treatment with nelfinavir (C1D-2) and at steady
state (C1D20). Complete, paired pharmacokinetic data

eleven in the expansion cohort at the 3125 mg bid MTD,
and ten at all other dose levels (Table 3). A patient with
progressive neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the midgut
and carcinoid syndrome had a partial response at the
MTD (subject 28, Table 3), yielding a 9.1% ORR at the
MTD and a 4.8% ORR in the overall population. Minor
responses (defined as tumor regressions < 30%) were
observed in three additional subjects, all of whom were
treated at the MTD. Two of these patients had NET of
the midgut or pancreas, (subjects 18 and 26) and one had
small cell lung cancer (subject 24, Table 3) although this
response was potentially confounded by radiation to the
target lesion completed months prior to enrollment. Four
subjects treated at the 3125 mg BID MTD (36%) who

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

had progressed prior to study entry, remained on study for
8 months or more. A subject with adenoid cystic carcinoma
was on study with stable disease for 11 months. Two of
the subjects with NET of the midgut were on study for at
least 8 months, and the subject that achieved a PR remained
on study for 23.5 months and received nelfinavir off study
for an additional six months with stable disease, prior
to disease progression in the liver and pelvis (Figure 4).
A subject with MEN1 syndrome and pancreatic NET was on
study for 12.4 months. In the responders with NET that had
carcinoid syndrome with flushing and diarrhea, nelfinavir
improved these symptoms within 7 days, which was
associated with transient decreases in levels of circulating
chromogranin, synaptophysin, and/or urinary 5-HIAA.

DISCUSSION

affecting bone marrow precursor cells. Unexpectedly,
several of the common toxicities of protease inhibitors
observed in HIV patients, such as central lipodystrophy,
dyslipidemia, or hyperglycemia were not frequently
observed in our study population.
One patient with NET of the midgut experienced
a partial response and two other patients with NET had
minor responses and prolonged stable disease after
documented progression prior to enrollment. Recently, a
trial with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus demonstrated
efficacy in pancreatic NET, driven mainly by stable
disease [27]. It is not known whether nelfinavir decreases
tumor growth in neuroendocrine tumors by inhibition of
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which can be activated
in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors by mutations in the
mTOR pathway [28], or by causing cytotoxicity due to ER
dysfunction and protein misfolding in a secretory tumor
with high rates of protein synthesis, bioactive hormone
release, and turnover.
The MTD of nelfinavir as a single agent in
solid tumors is 3125 mg bid, which is 2.5 fold over
the doses typically used in HIV patients. The PK data
showed potential non-linearity above doses of 1875
to 2500 mg. These data correspond with nelfinavir PK
in liposarcoma patients where the authors found nonlinearity above 3000 mg bid [24], and suggests that
dose escalation of nelfinavir to the 3125 mg bid MTD in
future single agent or combination studies in cancer may
not be warranted. Although our results and the results
in liposarcoma suggest that nelfinavir has activity as
a single agent, nelfinavir may have additional efficacy
when combined with different types of agents. For
example, nelfinavir has been combined with bortezomib
in preclinical studies to exploit proteotoxicity as a
mechanism of cancer cell death [29]. Nelfinavir can
also be safely combined with other chemotherapies
as well as radiation, because Phase I trials that used
the FDA-approved dose of nelfinavir with concurrent
chemoradiation in pancreatic cancer [30], rectal [31] and
NSCLC [32] have been reported.

Nelfinavir has pleiotropic mechanisms in cancer cells
including induction of ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy
[14], inhibition of angiogenesis [18], proteasome activity
[19], AKT [14], HIF1alpha [20], site-2 protease [21], and
hsp90 [22], as well as radiation sensitization [23]. The
fact that the crucial mechanism(s) in vivo are not known,
combined with the lack of knowledge regarding MTD,
informed our decision to perform a dose escalation phase I
trial. This study establishes the maximal tolerated dose of
nelfinavir in patients with mixed-cancer subtypes at 3125
mg BID, and is the first to describe potential benefit in
patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Nelfinavir was well
tolerated. At the 3125 mg BID MTD dose, patients did
not experience adverse reactions typically associated with
either cytotoxic chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
or the Akt/mTOR pathway (such as rash, mucositis and
hyperglycemia), nor did they experience significant
diarrhea as has been reported with nelfinavir in HIV
patients. These observations are consistent with the results
of a Phase I trial of nelfinavir in liposarcoma patients where
the MTD was not reached; however, auto-induction was
noted at the highest dose evaluated (4125 mg BID), and a
Phase II trial using a 3,000 mg BID dose is planned [24].
The dose limiting toxicity of nelfinavir is
neutropenia, and a blood smear from a patient
that experienced this DLT showed the presence of
cytoplasmic vacuoles in their neutrophils and monocytes,
as well as acanthocytosis. The presence of cytoplasmic
vacuoles is similar in appearance to the vacuoles
observed in cancer cell lines treated with nelfinavir in
vitro [14], and the red blood cell morphology is similar
that observed in GADD34 knockout mice [25] that
have increased levels of ER stress, because GADD34
dephosphorylates eif2alpha [26] and thereby reverses
translation inhibition under stress conditions. Cytosolic
vacuolization, plus the fact the neutropenia was rapidly
reversible, suggests this toxicity may be due to induction
of ER stress in mature cellular lineages rather than
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

8168

In conclusion, nelfinavir has great promise for
repositioning as an anti-cancer agent, as its DLT is readily
reversible, is otherwise well tolerated, and has preliminary
signs of anti-tumor activity, especially in patients with
NET of midgut and pancreatic origin. Future trials are
planned.

Drug Administration

METHODS

Subject Accrual

Nelfinavir was supplied by the Clinical Pharmacy
at the NIH Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center
(Bethesda, MD). Nelfinavir mesylate 625 mg tablets were
dispensed.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) intramural
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study
prior to its initiation. Subjects provided written informed
consent for their participation.

The starting dose of nelfinavir was the FDAapproved dose in HIV patients of 1250 mg twice daily,
which comprised dose level (DL) 1. Dose escalation
proceeded in 625 mg, twice-daily increments (DL2: 1875
mg, DL3: 2500 mg, DL4: 3125 mg, DL5: 3750 mg, DL6:
4375 mg).

Study Design

DLTs

This single institution, open-label, Phase Ia dose
escalation study was performed to establish the MTD and
DLT of nelfinavir in subjects with advanced refractory
solid tumors. The study used a modified Fibonacci
scheme, in which cohorts of three to six subjects were
entered at each dose level until two patients developed
DLT. If two or more subjects encountered DLT, then the
MTD was exceeded. The MTD was defined as the dose
level at which less than 2 of 6 subjects experienced DLT.
Each cycle lasted 21 days. Up to 6 additional patients
were allowed to be enrolled at the MTD in order to better
establish potential rates of toxicity.

Toxicity was graded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version
3.0. DLT was defined as any drug-related (possible,
probable, definite) grade 4 neutropenia, grade 3 or 4
neutropenia accompanied by fever 100.4 or greater,
grade 3 hypercholesterolemia, grade 3 diarrhea, or any
other grade 4 adverse event.

Ethics

Pharmacokinetic Methods
To determine CYP3A4 phenotype, a single 3 mg oral
dose of midazolam hydrochloride, a CYP3A4 substrate,
was administered at day -2 (2 days prior to commencing
nelfinavir) and again at steady state (cycle 1 day 20). Serial
venous blood samples were collected at 15, 30, 60, 120,
180, 240, and 300 minutes following administration of
midazolam. Nelfinavir pharmacokinetics (PK) were obtained
after single dose administration, cycle 1 day 1, and again at
steady state, cycle 2 day 1. Serial venous blood samples were
collected pre-dose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 hours after
administration. Plasma concentrations of midazolam and
nelfinavir were determined with a validated assay employing
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
with mass spectrometric detection. Noncompartmental
pharmacokinetic analyses were performed with WinNonlin
5.2 (Pharsight). Individual concentration-time profiles were
constructed for each patient, course and drug resulting
in four profiles per patient (two each for midazolam and
nelfinavir). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and
the time of maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) were
the observed values. Drug exposure was estimated using the
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). The area
under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero
to the time of the final quantifiable sample (AUClast) was
calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. The area
under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity
(AUCinf) was calculated by extrapolation, using the terminal
rate constant from the last measurable concentration.

Subject Selection
Subjects needed to have histologically confirmed
advanced cancer that had relapsed following or progressed
through standard therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2; expected
survival of at least 3 months, adequate hematologic and
renal function; total bilirubin less than the upper limit of
normal (ULN) and serum AST and ALT < 2.5 x ULN,
stable treated brain metastases, no uncontrolled intercurrent illness, no strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers,
no escalating doses of corticosteroids, no pregnant or
lactating women, and no chemotherapy or radiation within
28 days.

Clinical Care of Patients
Physical examinations, toxicity assessments and
laboratory analyses were conducted weekly during
cycle 1 and then every three weeks beginning cycle 2.
An electrocardiogram was performed every cycle, and
restaging scans were performed at baseline and every two
cycles thereafter. Subjects remained on study until disease
progression (as determined by RECIST), severe toxicity,
or individual choice.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were collected at baseline, and then twice after starting
nelfinavir: cycle 1 day 7 and cycle 1 day 42. Levels of
P-AKT S473, P-EIF2 alpha S51, ATF3 and CHOP in
PBMCs before and after nelfinavir were analyzed by
immunoblotting. Blood was collected in Vacutainer CPT
collection tubes with sodium heparin (BD Biosciences
cat# 362753) and mononuclear cells were isolated as per
the manufacturer’s instructions. PBMCs were washed
with PBS and lysed in 2X LSB buffer [33], aliquotted and
stored at -80°C. For analysis, equal amounts of protein
per sample were run on 10-12% SDS-PAGE gels, then
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes
were blocked in 5% milk in TBS + 0.1% tween (TBST)
and incubated with primary antibody diluted in 5% BSA

at C1D7 and C1D42 were compared against a baseline
sample for each patient, (prior to receiving nelfinavir).
Antibodies against P-AKT S473 #4060, P-EIF2 alpha
S51 #3398 and β-Actin #4970 were from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibodies to CHOP sc-7351
and ATF3 sc-188 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA).

Statistical Methods
Associations between pharmacokinetic parameters
and dose level of nelfinavir were determined using an
exact Jonckheere-Terpstra test for trend [35]. Comparison
of pharmacokinetic parameters between two time points
on paired subjects was performed with a Wilcoxon signed
rank test. All p-values are two-tailed.
