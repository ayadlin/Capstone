ABSTRACT
Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 strain (SAMP8) and PrP-hAβPPswe/
PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mice are classic animal models of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease
and familial AD respectively. Our study showed that object recognition memory,
spatial learning and memory, active and passive avoidance were deteriorated and
neuroendocrine immunomodulation (NIM) network was imbalance in SAMP8 and APP/
PS1 mice. SAMP8 and APP/PS1 mice had their own specific phenotype of cognition,
neuroendocrine, immune and NIM molecular network. The endocrine hormone
corticosterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, chemotactic
factor monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β,
regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted factor and eotaxin,
pro-inflammatory factor interleukin-23, and the Th1 cell acting as cell immunity
accounted for cognitive deficiencies in SAMP8 mice, while adrenocorticotropic
hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, colony stimulating factor granulocyte
colony stimulating factor, and Th2 cell acting as humoral immunity in APP/PS1 mice.
On the pathway level, chemokine signaling and T cell receptor signaling pathway
played the key role in cognition impairments of two models, while cytokine-cytokine
receptor interaction and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity were more important
in cognitive deterioration of SAMP8 mice than APP/PS1 mice. This mechanisms of
NIM network underlying cognitive impairment is significant for further understanding
the pathogenesis of AD and can provide useful information for development of AD
therapeutic drug.

INTRODUCTION

which accounts for early onset autosomal dominant forms.
There is no treatment prevent, halt, or reverse AD. Besides
the design problems and possible strategies including the
aspects of patients, drugs, outcome measurements, trial
protocol, and optimization of resources [1], the possible
reason of regretful results of these disease-modifying

Alzheimer`s disease (AD) is a progressive,
irreversible and age-related neurodegenerative disease.
AD mainly includes sporadic AD (SAD) which occurs in
patients aged 65 years or older and familial AD (FAD)

drugs could be poor understanding and methodology in
AD animal studies [2, 3].
PrP-hAβPPswe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mice and
senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 strain (SAMP8) are
classic animal models of FAD and SAD respectively. The
direct reason causing learning and memory impairment
in APP/PS1 mice is considered the overexpression of the
hAPP encoding gene with Swedish mutation together
with the mutant PS1 gene, which are combined to reach
elevated amyloid-β (Αβ) levels [4]. But the behavioral
defects do not show a synchronization with pathological
changes [5, 6] and the mechanisms responsible for the
AD-like behaviors of APP/PS1 mice may be associated
with the presences of intensive gliosis [7-9], tau-positive
neuritis [10], and dystrophic excitatory synaptic boutons
[11] with progressive amyloidosis. While, the direct reason
causing learning and memory impairment in SAMP8
mice is related to accelerated ageing. But it has also been
reported that the mechanisms of cognitive impairments in
SAMP8 mice may be related with neuronal degeneration
[12], inflammatory-amyloid cycle driven by oxidative
stress [13], age-related decrease in serum androgen and
estrogen levels [14, 15], elevated triggering receptor
expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) [16], increased
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [17]. Therefore,
the mechanisms of cognitive impairment in SAMP8 and
APP/PS1 mice remain elusive and unclear in multidimension and integrated system.
Neuroendocrine immunomodulation (NIM) network
plays an important role in the process of adaptation,
homeostasis, and defense against the factors of a hostile
environment [18]. The balance of NIM network maintains
the whole physiological homeostasis of body and normal
physiological process. Therefore, in this study, we
investigated the underpinnings of learning and memory
deficits in both AD animal models, SAMP8 and APP/PS1
mice, based on NIM network. We first comprehensively
examined the phenotypes of cognition, neuroendocrine,
immune and neuroendocrine immunomodulation
molecular network in both AD model. Then we identified
the key molecules in NIM network and cellular pathways
contributing to cognitive impairment in SAMP8 and APP/
PS1 mice using multiple linear regressions analysis and
network fingerprint analysis.

Results showed that the preferential index significantly
decreased at 1 and 24 hours after training in SAMP8
mice (Figure 1a), as well as in APP/PS1 mice (Figure 1b),
compared with their control SAMR1 and C57BL/6J (C57)
mice, respectively. This indicated that both SAMP8 mice
and APP/PS1 mice were deficit in the short and long term
object recognition memory respectively.
The step down test was used to determine passive
avoidance of SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice. Results
showed that SAMP8 mice had a significant increased
number of errors (Figure 1c) and a decreased in the latency
of reactions compared with the SAMR1 mice in step down
test (Figure 1d). Likewise, comparing with C57 mice,
the number of errors increased in APP/PS1 mice (Figure
1c). This indicated that there was impairment of passive
avoidance in SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice.
The shuttle box test was used to assess the active
avoidance of SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice. Results
showed that the successful avoidance times significantly
decreased in SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice compared
with SAMR1 and C57 mice respectively (Figure 1e).
This indicated that the active avoidance response was
deteriorated in SAMP8 and APP/PS1 mice.
The Morris water maze test was used to examine
ability of spatial learning and memory. Results showed
that SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice exhibited
longer retention latencies than SAMR1 and C57 mice
respectively in the learning task (Figure 1f). This result
indicated that the impairment of spatial learning occurs
in the SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice. The number of
crossing platform (Figure 1g) was less and the time in the
target quadrant (Figure 1h) was shorter than SAMR1 and
C57 mice respectively in the probe trial of Morris water
maze test. This indicated that the spatial memory ability
was deficient in SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice.

The abnormality of endocrine hormone and
cytokine in SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice
In order to investigate the mode of hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal (HPG) axis in SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice,
the concentration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) and concentrations of corticotropin releasing
hormone (CRH) in hypothalamuses, adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
and luteinizing hormone (LH) in pituitaries were measured
by radioimmunoassay. The level of testosterone (T)
and corticosterone (CORT) in plasmas were measured
by immunochemiluminescence assay and ELISA
respectively. Results showed that CRH, ACTH, and CORT
were significantly increased in SAMP8 and APP/PS1
mice compared with SAMR1 and C57 mice respectively.
Moreover, the concentration of CRH in SAMP8 mice was
more double than that in SAMR1 mice. This indicated

that specific pathways in MetaCore network of SAMP8 mice. These results indicated that the Chemokine signaling pathway and T cell
receptor signaling pathway might be potential target pathways for future AD drug development. Regarding to the SAD, the Cytokinecytokine receptor interaction and Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity should attract considerable attention as specific drug target
pathways, beyond that two common pathways.

was performed among all the endocrine hormone and
cytokine. Results showed that CORT, IL-5, MCP-1,
MIP-1β, TNF-β and IL-23 account for 96% of passive
avoidance response in SAMP8, while GM-CSF for 46%
in APP/PS1 mice (Table 3). LH and TNF-β account for
88% active avoidance response in SAMP8, and TNF-β for
76% in APP/PS1 mice (Table 3). FSH, LH, IL-2, MCP1, RANTES and IL-23 account for 95% spatial learning
and memory ability in SAMP8, and ACTH and G-CSF
for 58% in APP/PS1 mice (Table 3). GM-CSF, RANTES,
eotaxin and TNF-β account for 98% object recognition
memory in SAMP8, and ACTH, GnRH, IFN-γ and TNF-β
for 89% in APP/PS1 mice (Table 3).
For endocrine hormone contributing to cognitive
impairment, CORT, LH and FSH were important in
SAMP8, while ATCH and GnRH in APP/PS1 mice (Table
3). This indicated abnormal HPA and HPG axis trigger in
part the cognitive deficit in these two animal AD models.

For cytokines contributing to cognitive impairment,
chemotactic factor MCP-1, MIP-1β, RANTES and eotaxin
only decide deterioration of cognitive performance in
SAMP8, not APP/PS1 mice(Table 3). Pro-inflammatory
factor IL-23 contributed to cognitive impairment in
SAMP8, while colony stimulating factor G-CSF in
APP/PS1 mice (Table 3). The imbalance between Th1
and Th2 cell contributed to cognitive impairment in
SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice. But Th1 cell acting
as cell immunity accounted for learning and memory
deficiencies in SAMP8 mice(Supplemental material 5a),
while Th2 cell acting as humoral immunity in APP/PS1
mice (Supplemental material 5b).
In order to obtain the NIM network underlying
cognitive impairment, we submitted the factors

showed that the NIM network underlying cognitive
impairment of SAMP8 mice contained 127 nodes and 178
edges with characteristic path length 3.964 (Figure 3a3),
and network of APP/PS1 mice contained 67 nodes and 84
edges with characteristic path length 6.533 (Figure 3b3)
(supplemental material 2). The remarkable GO process
and KEGG pathway of SAMP8 mice were “response to
organic substance” and “Immune response IL-2 activation
and signaling pathway”, and those of APP/PS1 mice were
“cell surface receptor signaling pathway” and “Immune
response antiviral actions of interferons” (supplemental
material 3).
To identify the differences and similarities between
NIM network underlying cognitive impairment of SAMP8
and APP/PS1 mice, we adapted the “network fingerprint”
frameworks introduced by our colleagues recently [19].
The MetaCore networks in Figure 3a3 and Figure 3b3
were feed into this computational framework and making
systematic comparisons to well-characterized KEGG
pathways. The output standardized similarity score
(SSscorei) were graphically displayed in Figure 4a and
Figure 4b (Supplemental material 4). Since only positive
values are meaningful for functional association purpose,
we only plotted positive values as Figure 4c. Arbitrarily,
any pathway with SSscore >4 was considered to be a
specific functional pathway contributed to cognition
deficits. The scores plot showed the common pathways
correlated with cognition impairments of SAMP8 and
APP/PS1 mice (near the red dotted line) were chemokine
signaling pathway (#60) and T cell receptor signaling
pathway (#53) (Figure 4c), the different pathways (near
the blue dotted line) were cytokine-cytokine receptor
interaction (#24) and natural killer cell mediated
cytotoxicity (#57) and these were specific pathways in
MetaCore network of SAMP8 mice (Figure 4c).

imbalance of HPA and HPG axis. However, there was less
study on the HPA axis and HPG axis of APP/PS1 mice
and analogous models (Supplemental material 6). We
firstly detected the changes of HPA axis and HPG axis
of APP/PS1 mice, and the correlations between cognitive
impairment and them. According to our results, both HPA
axis and HPG axis in APP/PS1 mice were all malfunction.
Studies shows cytokines play a critical role in proand anti-inflammatory processes in AD, and complex
cognitive processes [32]. Compared the health, the
levels of IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-16, IL-18,
TNF, TGF-β, MCP and IL-8 are reportedly disordered in
AD [33]. This unbalanced state of cytokines have been
associated with cognitive decline and dementia [34, 35].
In this study, indiscriminate cytokine secretion was one
of potential mechanism underlying cognitive impairments
in APP/PS1 mice and SAMP8 mice, although the
direct reason causing AD-like behaviors and pathology
of APP/PS1 mice and SAMP8 mice was considered
the overexpression of the hAPP encoding gene with
Swedish mutation together with the mutant PS1 gene and
accelerated aging respectively.
In the present study, we firstly showed CORT, LH
and FSH correlated with the cognitive function of SAMP8
mice, ACTH and GnRH correlated with that of APP/PS1
mice. Moreover, TNF-β and GM-CSF correlated with
the cognitive function of SAMP8 and APP/PS1 mice,
while IL-2, IL-5, IL-23, MCP-1, MIP-1β, RANTES, and
eotaxin only correlated with the cognitive function of
SAMP8 mice, and IFN-γ, G-CSF only correlated with
that of APP/PS1 mice (Figure 5). In a clinical study,
testosterone and gonadotropins had been correlated with
cognitive impairment in normal male and the modulation
of Aβ metabolism [36]. In another clinical cross-sectional
study, a positive correlation between LH and TNF-α had
been described in people with AD [37]. In mice, reduction
of glucocorticoid receptor signaling stimulated the HPA
axis and impacted cognition [38, 39], and deletion of
glucocorticoid receptor could elevate corticosterone
concentration and aggravate cognitive impairment [40,
41]. It is well known that the APP/PS1 mice as FAD
animal model are induced by APP/PS1 transgene and
SAMP8 mice as SAD animal model are induced by
accelerated aging. However our present study indicated
the abnormal NIM network contributed the impairment
of cognition in both APP/PS1 transgene and SAMP8
mice. This is significant for further understanding the
pathogenesis of AD and can provide useful information
for research and development of AD therapeutic drug.
Comparing between the NIM network of APP/
PS1 and SAMP8 mice, we concluded that there were two
differences between them. The first is the T helper cell
polarization in NIM network contributing to cognitive
impairment. The Th1 cell acting as cell immunity
accounted for learning and memory deficiencies in
SAMP8 mice, while only Th2 cell acting as humoral

DISCUSSION
The disturbances of HPA axis contributed to the
cognitive impairments and psychological symptoms which
occurred in AD and thus participated in the etiology [20,
21]. Epidemiological and biochemical studies indicated a
relation between hormones of the HPG axis and cognitive
decline [2, 22-24]. Our previous study had shown that
impaired cognitive function of SAMP8 was related to the
age-related decrease in serum testosterone [25]. SAMP8
mice aged 26-31 weeks exhibited shortened estrous cycles
and high FSH levels compared to SAMP8 mice aged
8-12 weeks [26]. And there was an age-related increase
LH concentration, which higher in SAMP8 mice than
SAMR1 mice, after 7 months [27]. Our these previous
studies indicated that the HPG axis of SAMP8 mice was
ageing-induced malfunction, as well as the hyperactive
HPA axis of SAMP8 mice which might induce the
neurodegeneration [28-31]. The present study indicated
that SAMP8 mice at the age of 9 months exhibited the

immunity in APP/PS1 mice. It has been demonstrated that
the immunization with Aβ peptide results in prevention
of Aβ plaque formation and amelioration of established
plaques in the brain of transgenic mouse models of AD
[42, 43], and showed enhanced Th2 and down-regulated
Th1 immunity [44-46]. This explains why Th2 cell acting
as humoral immunity accounted for learning and memory
deficiencies in APP/PS1 mice. There were many studies
reported aging led to increased Th1 and Th2 cell numbers
and a decreased Th2/Th1 ratio [47, 48], while SAMP8
mice show the classic characteristic of AD due to aging.
These indicated that the overload of Aβ peptide caused the
enhanced Th2 cell immunity in APP/PS1 mice induced by
APP/PS1 transgene and Th1 cell in SAMP8 mice induced
by aging. The second difference is the pathways in NIM
network contributing to cognitive deterioration of both AD
mouse model. The cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction
(#24) and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity (#57)
were the specific pathways in NIM network of SAMP8
mice (Figure 4c). NK cells represent a subpopulation
of lymphocytes involving in innate immunity [49], as
well as the regulation of the immune response through
cytokine and chemokine production that activates other
cellular components of innate and adaptive immunity [50].
It was found in AD patients that the significant negative
correlations among the spontaneous release of cytokines
from NK cells and the decrease of cognitive function
[51, 52]. The dysfunction of NK cells substantially
accelerated Aβ pathogenesis and also exacerbated the
neuroinflammatory phenotype [53]. Alterations of NK cell
cytotoxicity control and NK-derived cytokine release were
involved in the neuroinflammatory mechanism related to
neurodegeneration and dementia progression in AD [54].
These indicated that chronic neuroinflammation may be
one cause inducing progressive neurodegeneration in
SAMP8 mice. That the NIM network is different between
SAMP8 and APP/PS1 mice can provide useful information
relating to understanding the relationship between NIM
network and AD. Therefore, when these two AD animal
models were used in the research and development
of AD drug, besides cognitive behavior and relative
pathological feature, it is requisite to take into account the
humoral immunity in APP/PS1 mice, cell immunity and
neuroinflammation in SAMP8 mice.
On above all, the present study provided a new
insight into the mechanisms underlying cognitive
impairments in SAMP8 and APP/PS1 mice. The
mechanisms of NIM network underlying cognitive
impairment in AD animal model suggested the restoration
of NIM network might be used to assess therapeutic
approaches to AD.

Experimental animals
SAMR1 and SAMP8 strains were obtained from
our breeding colonies, maintained as inbred strains
from original couples provided by Professor T. Takeda
(Department of Senescence Biology, Kyoto University).
There were male 9-month-old SAMR1 (n = 10) and
SAMP8 (n = 10) mice were utilized in two experimental
groups. The APP/PS1 mice were obtained from Beijing
HFK Bioscience CO., LTD.. The 11 male 12-monthold heterozygous transgenic mice, which harboring an
FAD-linked mutant AβPPswe/PS1ΔE9 co-expressing PS1
and a chimeric mouse-human AβPP 695 with mutations
(K595N, M596L) that are linked to Swedish pedigrees
via the mouse prion protein promoter and 15 age-matched
wild type mice were used in two experimental groups. All
animal experiments were performed in accordance with
the National Institutes of Health Guide of the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals.
All behavioral tests were performed between
19:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. (Beijing time). Following the
behavioral tests, the plasma, hypothalamus and pituitary
was collected for cytokine and hormone measurements.

Novel object recognition test
The procedure was according to Rick A bevins &
Toyce Besheer (2006) [55]. The experimental procedure
contains 3 phases: pre-training, training and testing. On the
1st and 2nd day, the mouse was allowed to acclimatize for
20 min per day. On the 3rd day, each mouse was allowed
to explore the sample objects for 16 min. One hour later,
the mouse was placed back to the similar chamber that
one of the two identical objects was switched to a new
one, to start a 4 min testing phase. On the 4th day (24
hours later), again the mouse was permitted to explore the
diverse objects freely for 4 min. In the testing session, the
preferential index (PI) was calculated using the following
formula:

Shuttle box test
The procedure of shuttle-box was according to
Cheng, et al. (2011) [56]. Working memory was evaluated
by the shuttle box apparatus (Med Associates Inc.).
Training session began with an acclimatization to the
chambers of 2 min followed by 30 trails, and inter-trial
interval was 30 s. The tone (60dB) and light (8W) were
used as the conditioned stimulus, for 10s. Followed by the
unconditioned stimulus, an electrical foot shock (0.2 mA),

for 5s. The shuttle-box procedure was performed for 5
consecutive days. At the 6th day, all mice were submitted
to another session (no shock) of shuttle-box to test the
level of the learning and memory ability. The number of
active avoidances was recorded during the test.

The level of plasma CORT in HPA axis of the mice
were measured with precoated corticosterone ELISA kit
(EC3001-1, ASSAYPRO) according to the manufacturer`s
instruction. The absorbance was measured at 450nm
with a reference wavelength of 570 nm using Enspire TM
multilabel reader 2300 (Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland).

Step-down test
The procedure of step-down was according to He,
et al. (2010), Shi, et al. (2010) and Luo, et al. (2012) [5759]. On the 1st day, mouse was allowed to acclimatize for
2 min. The learning trail, if the mouse stepped down from
the platform (error) with all four paws, they received an
aversive foot electric shock (36V, AC), and the learning
course was performed for 10 min. The number of errors
and the time of the mice first stayed on the platform were
scored. The testing trials (day 2-7), the procedure was
repeated at the same time, testing time was 3 min. The
number of errors was recorded.

Radioimmunoassay of
hypophyseal hormones

and

The hypothalamuses and pituitaries were weighed
and boiled in 1 mL saline for 5 min. Peptides were
extracted by homogenizing in 0.5 mL of 1 M glacial
acetic acid followed by centrifuging the mixture at 3000
rpm for 30 min. CRH and ACTH of HPA axis, GnRH,
LH, and FSH of HPG axis in the supernatants were
determined with 125I-ATCH RIA kit (North Institute of
Biological Technology), 125I-LH RIA kit (North Institute of
Biological Technology), 125I-FSH RIA kit (North Institute
of Biological Technology), 125I-CRH RIA kit (Department
of Neurobiology of the Second Medical University ),
125
I-GnRH RIA kit (Department of Neurobiology of the
Second Medical University), respectively.

Morris water maze test
The procedure of Morris-water maze test was
according to Vorhees CV and Williams MT (2006) [60].
The spatial learning phase consisted of 4 trials per day for
5 days, and one additional day (6th day) for probe trial.
In the spatial learning phase, each mouse was placed on
the platform for 60s before the first trial, then released
into the water, allowed to find platform within 60s. If the
mouse did not find the platform within 60s, it was gently
led to the platform and allowed to remain there for 10s,
the latency time was scored as 60s. The latency time was
recorded as measures for spatial learning. For the spatial
memory phase, the platform was removed, and the mouse
was released into the water at a novel position and allowed
to swim freely within 60s. The dependent measure for the
spatial memory was the time in the target quadrant and the
number of crossing the platform.

Immunochemiluminescence assay
The level of plasma T in HPG axis of the mice was
measured with Acces Immunoassay System (Beckman
Coulter), access testosterone (33560, Beckman Coulter)
and access testosterone calibrators (33565, Beckman
Coulter). The entire measurement processed according to
the scheduled program automatically.

Principal component analysis
PCA is a classical multivariate technique, the aim
is to extract the important information from numerous
(n) possibly correlated variables (M1, M2, …, Mn) and to
represent it as a set of fewer variables, named principal
components (PC) [61]. In the present study, a data matrix
with m observations on k1, k2 and k3 variables (m = 46,
the number of individuals in the entire data set, k1 = 4,
cognitive markers, k2 = 7, neuroendocrine markers, k3
= 16, immune markers). We chose the PC1 and PC2 to
plot, in order to distinguish SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice,
C57 and APP/PS1 mice from cognitive, neuroendocrine
and immune phenotype. The PCA was processed SAS 9.2
(SAS Institute Inc.), and visualized by GraphPad Prism®,
version 6.

Multiplex bead analysis
Cytokine were measured according to the
manufacturer`s instructions of multiplex bead analysis
(Millipore Corp.). The samples were analyzed by Luminex
200TM (Luminex). The concentrations of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-5,
IL-17, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF-α,
MCP-1, RANTES, eotaxin, MIP-1β were detected by a
milliplex map kit (MCYTOMAG-70K), and IL-23, TNF-β
were detected by another milliplex map kit (MGAMMAG300K).

Statistical analysis

Multiple linear regressions analysis is a modelling
technique for investigation of the relationship between
one dependent variable and several independent variables.
In the present study, in order to find the most important
molecule respectively contributing to 4 types of cognitive
impairments in SAMP8 mice and APP/PS1 mice, stepwise
multiple linear regression analysis was performed.
The dependent variables were the type of cognitive
impairments with 46 observations, and the independent
variables were 23 molecules of endocrine hormone and
cytokine. Statistical analyses were performed SAS 9.2.
The significance level was set at P < 0.05.

All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. GraphPad
Prism®, version 6 was used to plot and analyze data.
Data between two groups were compared by Student’s
t-test. Comparisons of data from multiple groups
against one group was analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test
or two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance with
Tukey multiple comparisons test. P < 0.05 was taken as
statistically significant. Linear regression was using twotailed Pearson analysis with 95% confidence interval
by GraphPad Prism, the correlation was considered
statistically significant if P < 0.05.

Metacore network analysis

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The procedure of Metacore network analysis was
according to Cheng, et al. (2013) [62]. We submitted
the differential molecules, the molecules correlated with
cognition analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis, and
the most important molecules contributing to cognitive
impairment analyzed by multiple linear regression
analysis in the present study to the MetaCore database,
respectively. To obtain comparatively complete networks
for SAMP8 and APP/PS1 mice, the “Auto expand”
algorithm was employed, and visualized by Cytoscape,
version 3.2.1 [63]. For the biological and functional
annotation of the networks, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway enrichment were performed based on the
MetaCore database. The top ten GO processes and KEGG
pathways (P < 10-3 and FDR < 0.01) were considered to
be a specific function and biological pathway networks.
