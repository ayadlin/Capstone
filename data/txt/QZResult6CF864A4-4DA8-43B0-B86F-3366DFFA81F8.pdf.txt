BACKGROUND: More than 80,000 postmenopausal breast cancer patients in the United States each year are estimated to begin a 5year course of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) to prevent recurrence. AI-related arthralgia (joint pain and/or stiffness) may contribute to
nonadherence, but longitudinal data are needed on arthralgia risk factors, trajectories, and background in postmenopause. This study
sought to describe 1-year arthralgia trajectories and baseline covariates among patients with AI and a postmenopausal comparison
group. METHODS: Patients initiating AIs (n 5 91) were surveyed at the time of AI initiation and at 6 repeated assessments over 1 year.
A comparison group of postmenopausal women without breast cancer (n 5 177) completed concomitantly timed surveys. Numeric
rating scales (0-10) were used to measure pain in 8 joint pair groups (bilateral fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles,
and toes). Poisson regression models were used to analyze arthralgia trajectories and risk factors. RESULTS: By week 6, the AI-initiating group had more severe arthralgia than did the comparison group (ratio of means 5 1.8, 95% confidence interval 5 1.24-2.7,
P 5.002), adjusting for baseline characteristics. Arthralgia then worsened further over 1 year in the AI group. Menopausal symptom
severity and existing joint-related comorbidity at baseline among women initiating AI were associated with more severe arthralgia
over time. CONCLUSIONS: Patients initiating AI should be told about the timing of arthralgia over the first year of therapy, and
advised that it does not appear to resolve over the course of a year. Menopausal symptoms and joint-related comorbidity at AI

INTRODUCTION
Randomized clinical trials have shown that aromatase inhibitors (AIs) improve breast cancer disease-free survival compared with tamoxifen among postmenopausal women with early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.1 On the
basis of these findings, AIs have, since 2006, become standard of care for adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal
women. The American Cancer Society estimates that there are nearly 3 million breast cancer survivors in the United
States, and more than 226,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.2 Each year, more than 80,000 women in the United
States are estimated to begin a course of 5 or more years of AI as adjuvant endocrine therapy.
AI-associated arthralgia (joint pain and/or stiffness) is of serious concern, in that it may be undermining effective
cancer treatment in these patients. Adverse event data from clinical trials and observational studies have indicated that AIs
are associated with arthralgia in some women.3,4 Arthralgia may negatively impact patients’ health-related quality of life
(HRQoL) and cause suboptimal adherence and/or discontinuation.3,5 More than half of patients taking adjuvant endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or AI) were found to discontinue early in one study.6 In another study, 24% discontinued AI

specifically due to musculoskeletal symptoms.7 AI adherence is known to decline over time, with nearly 40% suboptimal adherence by the third year of AI therapy.8
Findings to date on arthralgia incidence, risk factors,
and trajectories have been inconsistent.4,9-11 Prevalence
estimates for AI-associated arthralgia vary widely, from
10% to 61%.9,12,13 Some of these estimates come from
physician reports, whereas others are based on retrospective or small prospective studies that lacked consistent definitions of arthralgia, lacked control groups, did not
measure HRQoL, or were nested within clinical trials.
There is conflicting information about arthralgia risk
factors.4,9 Associations between patient characteristics,
treatments, and pain outcomes are highly variable across
studies,4,9,11 reflecting variation in measurement and
design methodologies.
Few prospective studies in clinical practice settings
have followed arthralgia longitudinally along with other
relevant clinical, demographic, and patient-reported outcomes. This prospective cohort was designed to longitudinally assess arthralgia, clinical and patient-reported
arthralgia predictors, and other clinical and patientreported outcomes including HRQoL, using consistent
measurement criteria to enable comparisons across groups
and against future studies. The objectives of this study
were to 1) quantify differences in arthralgia trajectories
between women initiating AIs and a comparison group of
postmenopausal women without cancer over a 52-week
observation period; 2) identify baseline demographic,
clinical, and HRQoL arthralgia risk factors such as age,
employment status, depression, or menopausal symptom
severity; and 3) identify arthralgia risk factors including
cancer-relevant clinical characteristics among the subgroup of women taking AIs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Setting

We conducted a prospective cohort study (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier NCT00954564) with 52 weeks of
follow-up per participant. The study was approved by the
Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board. To
measure patient-reported data, we used paper questionnaires administered at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 52
weeks. Clinical data were abstracted from electronic medical records. Study personnel at Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer
Center, Vanderbilt Institute for Medicine and Public
Health, and Vanderbilt Women’s Health Research
conducted screening, enrollment, data collection, and
analysis. Data were collected using paper surveys and
managed using Research Electronic Data Capture.14

Participants

We recruited participants into 2 groups: women initiating
AIs and a comparison group of postmenopausal women
who had never been diagnosed with breast cancer. Because
arthralgia is common in postmenopausal women regardless of breast cancer or endocrine therapy,15 the comparison group was selected to assess the background rate of
arthralgia in menopause, using the same measurement
scale and time frame. Starting in 2009, participants were
recruited either by their treating physician at a Vanderbilt
University Medical Center clinic or by community
recruitment (flyers, e-mail listserv, Metro Transit Authority bus advertisements) in greater Nashville, Tennessee.
Participants in either group had to be female, postmenopausal (self-report of at least 12 months without a menstrual period, unrelated to surgery or medication), aged
35 to 90 years, and have self-reported performance status16  3. AI group participants had to initiate anastrazole, exemestane, or letrozole within 30 days of baseline
assessment. Comparison group respondents had to never
have been told they had breast cancer by a doctor.
Respondents were ineligible if currently undergoing treatment for another cancer not of the breast, unable to provide informed consent, and/or were non-English
speaking, pregnant, or had metastatic disease. Screening
was either by telephone or self-administered via http://
www.breastcancersurvivorstudy.com. Follow-up comprised phone and mail contact to assist participants in
staying on schedule. Women were considered lost to follow-up if they missed more than 2 surveys in a row and
could not be reached after 6 attempts.
Variables

We measured clinical, demographic, and HRQoL variables using existing validated scales when such instruments
were available. Clinical characteristics included body mass
index, time in menopause, analgesic use, and comorbidities collected via patient self-report. We categorized
comorbidities as joint-related or not. The surveys also
assessed depression,17 performance status,18 menopausal
symptoms,19 physical function,20 sleep disturbance,21
exercise frequency,22 demographics (age, race, ethnicity,
marital/partnered status, employment status, education,
and income), comorbidities, and arthralgia. Among the
AI group, we collected information on cancer treatments
including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and stage at
diagnosis. Table 1 shows how categorical variables were
dichotomized for analysis.

preceding 7 days in 8 joint pair groups: bilateral fingers,
wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and toes.
We scored the PRAI by computing the sum joint pain rating across all joints, resulting in a composite arthralgia

Wilcoxon signed rank tests, t tests, chi-square tests, and
Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare baseline characteristics and arthralgia composite scores between the AI
and comparison groups. We used Poisson regression with

longitudinal joint pain sum scores on group, time since
enrollment, time 3 group interaction, and other baseline
covariates. The arthralgia composite score was taken as
the sum score across all joints for an individual at a given
week, with the Poisson model appropriately accounting
for the log number of joints with observed scores as the exposure offset (Tables 2 and 3). Such a structure allows
modeling the mean pain score per joint, adjusting for relevant covariates. An exchangeable correlation structure was
assumed for repeated measures, with the understanding
that GEE methods are robust for misspecification of the
covariance structure.
Baseline clinical and demographic variables selected
for the model were those factors hypothesized to be associated with greater arthralgia over time: baseline composite
arthralgia score, increased body mass index, joint-related
comorbidity, depression, less exercise, more severe menopausal symptoms, and greater sleep disturbance. We also
included factors by which the groups differed (Table 1) to
account for potential confounding by these factors: age,
years in menopause, education, marital status, income,
employment, performance status, strong analgesic use,
and physical function. Several baseline variables were
missing observations for about 5% of the sample, resulting in about 30% of patients missing data for at least 1
covariate. The median (continuous variables) or mode
(binary/categorical variables) was imputed for these covariates such that the model included all patients with outcome data. Given that missing data was at a rate of < 5%
per variable, more elaborate imputation strategies such as
multiple imputation yielded similar results (results not
shown).
A secondary and exploratory question was to identify arthralgia risk factors among the AI group. Because

certain clinical characteristics of interest (chemotherapy,
radiation, surgery, and stage at diagnosis) were specific to
the AI group, a subgroup analysis with a restricted sample
size was necessary to evaluate such factors. For this subgroup, a Poisson regression model with GEE was used to
regress longitudinal arthralgia composite scores on all
those baseline factors included in the previous model, plus
those clinical characteristics specific to the AI group. Statistical analyses were conducted using R software, version
2.15.2, and SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows cohort screening and enrollment. The analytic sample comprised data from 91 women enrolled in
the AI group and 177 women in the comparison group.
Attrition did not differ by group over time (P 5 .99);
attrition rates overall were 17% at week 2, 23% at week 4,
28% at week 6, 34% at week 8, 37% at week 12, and 47%
at week 52.
Baseline clinical, demographic, and HRQoL characteristics are shown in Table 1. At baseline, the AI and
comparison groups did not differ on the outcome of composite arthralgia score. Factors on which the groups did
differ were used to adjust the multivariable models. In all
tables, statistically significant results are indicated in bold.
Lack of differences between groups led us to exclude race,
ethnicity, and surgery in the multivariable models.
Figure 2 shows model-based mean trajectories of
arthralgia by group, and differences by group over 52
weeks of observation. In the multivariable model including both groups (Table 4), no baseline demographic or
clinical covariates (other than baseline arthralgia) were
associated with longitudinal arthralgia, adjusting for other
variables in the model. However, menopausal symptoms
(P 5 .08), joint-related comorbidity (P 5 .08), and exercise (P 5 .09) approached the 0.05 significance level.
Model-based trajectories diverged by group at week 6

(Fig. 2). The trajectories also showed an increase in
arthralgia severity over the 52 weeks of per-participant
observation.
As shown in Table 5, a multivariable model among
only the AI group showed that baseline severity of menopausal symptoms (ratio of means 0.97 [95% CI
0.95,1.00]) and presence of joint-related comorbidity (ratio of means 1.71 [95% CI 1.12,2.61], including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus,
gout, ankylosing spondylitis, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis,
osteopenia, or Sj€
ogren’s syndrome) were associated with
increased arthralgia severity over a year. We did not

chemotherapy.
With regard to adherence, over 1 year, 78 (83%) of
the women initiating AI were reported as still taking either
the AI they initiated or another AI; 11 (12%) were
reported switched to tamoxifen, and 5 (5%) were reported
as having discontinued adjuvant endocrine therapy
entirely.

All effect variables are baseline values coded dichotomously except as
otherwise noted. Exponentiated b estimates represent ratio of mean arthralgia
per joint between each level of categorical variables, and multiplicative mean
change for each 1-unit change in continuous variables. Estimates for intercept

enced a statistically significant increase in arthralgia severity. This finding is consistent with other recent
studies.24,25 Our trajectory analysis indicated that after
this 6-week worsening, arthralgia does not appear to
resolve, and in fact worsens further over the first year of AI
therapy. Future research should extend the observation
period beyond a year and should also address the clinical
meaningfulness of observed increases in arthralgia severity, using larger cohorts to enable more precise estimates
of the outcome over time.26 Future research should also
compare the AIs with each other and with tamoxifen,
because switching therapeutics appears to be a strategy for
managing AI-related arthralgia, yet little is known about
the relative benefits of switching with regard to arthralgia
severity.
We found not only that, over time, women taking
AI had more severe arthralgia than women in the comparison group, but also that women taking AI with more
severe menopausal symptoms or existing joint-related
conditions at the time of AI initiation had worse arthralgia

over time. Targeted intervention in these at-risk groups
may improve AI adherence. To date, no single treatment
strategy has emerged as satisfactory.3 Although analgesics
may be efficacious,13 it is feared that opioids may mask
the pain associated with actual degeneration of joints.3
Soy-derived genistein may alleviate symptoms by raising
estrogen levels, but in doing so, it interferes with the efficacy of AIs.27 Vitamin D,28,29 calcium, and bisphosphonates30 have been proposed for study on the basis of bone
loss underlying AI-associated arthralgia. Other therapies
include antidepressants, hypnotics, duloxetine, gabapentin, anti-irritants, omega essential fatty acids, steroidal
injections, targeted heat, weight loss, yoga, resistance exercise, cardiovascular aerobics, and water aerobics.3,31,32
More research assessing arthralgia, HRQoL, adherence,
and switching therapies should be done to aid in the development of effective intervention strategies.33-35
Our findings also suggest that arthralgia may be part
of a cluster of menopausal/vasomotor symptoms including hot flashes, sweats, vaginal discharge, loss of interest in
sex, diarrhea, headaches, and irritability; these factors
should also be assessed as potential AI secondary effects.
None of the following showed evidence of being arthralgia
risk factors: age, race, physical function, education,
income, employment, performance status, body mass
index, marital/partnered status, exercise frequency, or
sleep disturbance. This is consistent with other recent
studies that have lacked evidence for a clear set of arthralgia predictors, including studies on biomarkers.24,25 We
propose that menopausal symptom severity and the presence of joint-related conditions at AI initiation should be
points of focus, and that future studies of arthralgia in this
population measure these potentially important predictive
factors.
Our findings have specific implications for clinical
practice. First, women initiating AI should be advised that
arthralgia worse than what one could expect after menopause appears to develop 6 weeks after AI initiation, and
that it does not appear to resolve over the first year. They
should be monitored for arthralgia development and/or
worsening; follow-up visits could be timed so that patients
are seen within this interval to address emergent arthralgia. Women initiating AI therapy should be evaluated for
the presence of baseline menopausal symptoms and jointrelated conditions and advised about increased arthralgia
risk; these patients should also be targeted in future AI adherence interventions. Finally, all patients initiating AI
should be warned they may develop arthralgia, and strategies for managing arthralgia or switching therapies
should be discussed to reduce nonadherence.

Study limitations include selection bias as evidenced
by differences in baseline characteristics between the AI
and comparison groups. These differences were likely due
to the fact that more AI group participants than comparison group participants were recruited in-clinic versus in
the community, respectively. To minimize the impact of
these differences on our trajectory estimates, we included
the differing factors as adjustment variables in our multivariable models.36 With few African American women enrolled in the AI group, lack of variation led us to exclude
race as a risk factor, and comparisons in trajectories by
race were not possible; oversampling of African American
women is warranted to detect potential differences by
race. Missing outcome data due to loss to follow-up was
also a potential source of bias; however, attrition rates did
not differ by group. Finally, the subset model of the AI
group lacked sufficient sample size and was therefore overfitted; future research is needed to confirm findings from
this model.
By characterizing arthralgia in women initiating AI
and its background rate in women without breast cancer,
these findings can help oncologists advise their patients
with early-stage breast cancer about what to expect over
time. Improved understanding and management of AIassociated arthralgia are keys toward improving AI adherence and minimizing cancer recurrence.3,37 Further
research is needed not only on longer term arthralgia trajectories, but also on the relationships of arthralgia with
HRQoL, AI adherence, recurrence, and mortality in
women taking AIs.
