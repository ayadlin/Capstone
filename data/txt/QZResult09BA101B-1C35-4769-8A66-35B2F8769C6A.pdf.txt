Abstract
PR-104, currently in clinical trial, is converted systemically to
the dinitrobenzamide nitrogen mustard prodrug PR-104A,
which is reduced selectively in hypoxic cells to cytotoxic
hydroxylamine (PR-104H) and amine (PR-104M) metabolites.
Here, we evaluate the roles of this reductive metabolism, and
DNA interstrand cross-links (ICL), in the hypoxic and aerobic
cytotoxicity of PR-104. Using a panel of 9 human tumor cell
lines, cytotoxicity was determined by clonogenic assay after a
2-hour aerobic or hypoxic exposure to PR-104A. PR-104H and
PR-104M were determined by high performance liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry, and ICL with the alkaline comet assay. Under hypoxia, the relationship between ICL
and cell killing was similar between cell lines. Under aerobic
conditions, there was a similar relationship between ICL and
cytotoxicity, except in lines with very low rates of aerobic
reduction of PR-104A (A2780, C33A, H1299), which showed an
ICL-independent mechanism of PR-104A cytotoxicity. Despite
this, in xenografts from the same lines, the frequency of PR104–induced ICL correlated with clonogenic cell killing (r2 =
0.747) with greatest activity in the fast aerobic metabolizers.
In addition, changing levels of hypoxia in SiHa tumors
modified both ICL frequency and tumor growth delay in
parallel. We conclude that both aerobic and hypoxic nitroreduction of PR-104A contribute to the monotherapy antitumor activity of PR-104 in human tumor xenografts, and that
ICL are responsible for its antitumor activity and represent a
broadly applicable biomarker for tumor cell killing by this
novel prodrug. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):3884–91]

Introduction
The abnormal microvasculature in tumors gives rise to spatially
and temporally disorganized blood flow, resulting in regions of
severe hypoxia (1, 2). The difference in oxygenation between
tumors and normal tissues makes hypoxia a theoretically attractive
therapeutic target, particularly when hypoxic cells are refractory to
radiotherapy and many chemotherapy drugs, and also contribute
to tumor progression through multiple mechanisms (3, 4).

Attempts to target tumor hypoxia currently focus on agents that
exploit the molecular phenotype of hypoxic cells, especially
stabilized HIF-1 and its transcriptional targets (5), and on
hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAP, also called hypoxic cytotoxins
or bioreductive drugs). The latter are reduced enzymatically to
DNA-reactive cytotoxins via pathways that are inhibited by
molecular oxygen (3, 6–8). A complicating factor in targeting
HIF-1 is that its activity is subject to complex oxygen-independent
regulation (9–11). In contrast, many HAP can act as direct sensors
of oxygen that oxidizes the initial free radical reduction product to
regenerate the parent prodrug, thus confining toxicity to hypoxic
cells (12). Although many HIF-1 inhibitors and HAP are in
development, none have yet been registered for clinical use. The
HAP that is most advanced in clinical trial, tirapazamine, recently
failed its primary end point in a pivotal registration trial in
combination with chemoradiation for advanced head and neck
cancer (13), although improved locoregional control was shown in
a subset of patients with more hypoxic tumors as assessed by
positron emission tomography imaging (14). This observation is
consistent with a large body of evidence that hypoxia limits
outcome in radiotherapy of head and neck tumors (15–17), but the
clinical experience with tirapazamine points to the need for HAP
with superior therapeutic activity.
The 3,5-dinitrobenzamide mustard PR-104A is a new HAP that is
selectively reduced to reactive cytotoxic nitrogen mustards
(hydroxylamine PR-104H and amine PR-104M) under hypoxia
(18); chemical structures are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. PR104A is delivered by administration of a water-soluble phosphate
ester, PR-104, which shows greater antitumor activity than
tirapazamine in preclinical models (18, 19) and has recently
completed phase I trial (20). PR-104A penetrates into hypoxic
regions of tumors more efficiently than tirapazamine because it is
less rapidly reduced in moderately hypoxic tissue (19), which may
also avoid toxicities of tirapazamine that arise through physiologic
hypoxia in normal tissue (21, 22). In common with other
dinitrobenzamide mustards (23), reduced metabolites of PR-104A
are able to diffuse from cells in which they are formed (18) and
provide a bystander effect that seems to contribute to preclinical
antitumor activity of PR-104 as monotherapy and in combination
with radiation (18, 19).
Hypoxic tumor cells are often noncycling or slowly cycling
(24–26), making them resistant to many anticancer agents. A key
objective in the design of PR-104 was therefore to generate a
long-lived DNA lesion capable of killing hypoxic cells when they
reoxygenate and resume cycling. We therefore sought to exploit
the potency and longevity of nitrogen mustard DNA interstrand
cross-links (ICL) that are difficult for mammalian cells to repair,
requiring collaboration between proteins of the nucleotide

Hypoxia-Selective DNA Cross-Linking by PR-104

excision repair, mismatch repair, homologous recombination
repair, translesion synthesis, and Fanconi’s anemia pathways (27,
28). The first stage in repair of nitrogen mustard ICL
(‘‘unhooking’’) has a half-time of f1 to 2 days (29, 30) and
full repair is presumed to be even slower (27). Reflecting this
slow repair, nitrogen mustards show little loss of cytotoxic
potency in noncycling cells (31, 32).
To generate such a lesion in hypoxic cells, we used the
reduction of an electron-withdrawing nitro group (in PR-104A)
to an electron-donating hydroxylamine or amine, which acts as
an ‘‘electronic switch’’ that activates a prepositioned latent
nitrogen mustard moiety (33–35). A preliminary study showed
the formation of ICL from PR-104A, selectively in hypoxic cells,
and the subsequent ser-139 phosphorylation of histone H2AX,
which is presumably in part due to DNA replication fork arrest
(18). However, whether ICLs are the sole (or major) mechanism
of PR-104A cytotoxicity, in either aerobic or hypoxic cells, is
unknown.

Our two key objectives here were to clarify the mechanism of
action of PR-104 and assess whether ICL represent a reliable
surrogate for its antitumor activity. To this end, we examine
relationships between metabolism of PR-104A to its reduced
metabolites (by mass spectrometry), frequency of DNA ICL (by
alkaline comet assay), and cytotoxicity (by clonogenic assay) in a
panel of nine human tumor cell lines under aerobic and hypoxic
conditions. We also evaluate DNA cross-linking and clonogenic cell
killing in the corresponding tumor xenografts, and test whether
changing the level of hypoxia in SiHa tumors influences ICL and
antitumor activity.

Materials and Methods
Compounds. PR-104 was supplied as its clinical formulation by Proacta,
Inc. PR-104A was synthesized as described (36), stored at 20jC, and stock
solutions (200 mmol/L in DMSO) were stored at 80jC. PR-104H, prepared
by zinc dust reduction of PR-104A (18), was purified by preparative high

performance liquid chromatography and stored as acetonitrile stock
solutions (1.67 mmol/L) at 80jC. Tetradeuterated (d4) PR-104H was
synthesized from d4-PR-104A (37). All PR-104 compounds had a purity of
>95% by high performance liquid chromatography based on absorbance at
254 nm. Chlorambucil (Sigma) stock solutions (200 mmol/L in DMSO) were
stored at 80jC.
Cell lines. Cell lines were passaged in a minimal essential medium
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. Cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection except for gifts of H1299 and
C33A (Onyx Pharmaceuticals), HT29 (Dr. D. Ross, University of Colorado,
Boulder, CO), A2780 (European Collection of Cell Cultures), and SiHa (Dr. D.
Cowan, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada). The SiHa cell line
overexpressing NADPH:cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, SiHaCYPOR, has been
described (38). Cells were used within 3 mo of thawing frozen stocks
confirmed to be Mycoplasma free by PCR-ELISA (Roche Diagnostics).
Clonogenic assays. Cell killing was assessed by clonogenic assay after
2 h of drug exposure under aerobic or hypoxic conditions as described
(38), except that 2  106 cells were exposed in 3 mL medium/P60 dish.
Surviving fraction was calculated as the ratio of colonies from treated/
control plates.
Detection of DNA cross-linking (alkaline comet assay). Effects on
DNA breakage induced by cobalt-60 g-irradiation (10 Gy) was assayed
using the alkaline comet assay at the University of Auckland (Figs. 1, 3,
and 6) as previously described (18). One hundred images on duplicate
slides were analyzed to determine mean tail moment. DNA cross-linking
index was calculated as the ratio (A B)/A where A = (mean tail moment
of irradiated non–drug-treated cells) (mean tail moment of unirradiated
non–drug-treated cells) and B = (mean tail moment of irradiated drugtreated cells)
(mean tail moment of unirradiated drug treated cells).
Studies reported in Supplementary Fig. S4 and Fig. 5B were undertaken at
Stanford University using a variant (39) of the above comet assay, which
had lower sensitivity to ICL.
Determination of PR-104A metabolites by liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry. Cells were exposed to PR-104A under aerobic
and hypoxic conditions as for clonogenic assays above, except that 5  105
cells were plated per well in 24-well trays, in 0.35 mL medium. After
attachment for 2 h, 50 AL prewarmed medium without (controls) or with
PR-104A ( final concentration, 100 Amol/L) was added to triplicate cultures
for each cell line, which were incubated for 60 min. Plates were removed
from the aerobic or anoxic incubator onto ice, and the medium was
transferred to chilled microcentrifuge tubes. The cell monolayer was
extracted with 0.8 mL methanol containing 1.5 Amol/L d4-PR-104H internal
standard, added to the medium samples, mixed, and stored at 80jC for
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Details of the
analytic method are given in the legend to Supplementary Fig. S3.
Clonogenic killing and DNA cross-linking in human tumor
xenografts. Female homozygous nude (CD1-Foxn1nu) mice were bred by
the Vernon Jansen Unit (University of Auckland). Animal studies were
approved by the University of Auckland Animal Ethics Committee (approval
R279). Tumors were grown s.c from 107 cells in 100 AL a minimal essential
medium. Mice were randomized to treatment groups (5 per group) when
tumors reached 8 to 10 mm mean diameter and dosed i.p. with 348 mg/kg
(600 Amol/kg) PR-104 at 0.01 mL/g body weight. Twenty-four hours later,
tumors were excised, dissociated enzymatically (18), and clonogenic cell
survival and ICL were quantified as above.
Tumor growth inhibition and DNA cross-linking in SiHa xenografts.
Tumor growth delay experiments were done with 150 to 200 mm3 SiHa
tumors treated with 250 mg/kg PR-104 weekly for 3 wk with each exposure
being under 1 of 3 oxygen breathing conditions. Immediately after PR-104,
mice were transferred to chambers where they breathed carbogen (95%
oxygen, 5% CO2), air, or 10% oxygen for 2 h. This is sufficient time for PR-104
clearance (18). Tumor volumes were measured with calipers thrice per
week. Six hours after the first PR-104 dose, fine needle aspirates were drawn
from each tumor using a 20 cc syringe with a 23 gauge needle containing 2
to 3 mL cold calcium- and magnesium-free PBS. Cells were counted, diluted
to 3  104/mL, and irradiated on ice (5 Gy) for measurement of ICL by
comet assay. In parallel experiments, hypoxia in tumors under these three

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

oxygen-breathing conditions was assessed using the hypoxia marker
pimonidazole (100 mg/kg; Hypoxyprobe-1 kit; Chemicon Int). Percentages
of pimonidazole labeled cells were quantitated using point scoring under
150 magnification.

Results
ICL from PR-104A and chlorambucil are repaired with
similar kinetics. DNA ICL frequencies in SiHa cells, determined
using the alkaline comet assay, showed that ICL followed a similar
time course for both PR-104A and chlorambucil after a 1-hour
hypoxic exposure, increasing in the first 4 hours after treatment
before declining with a half-life of f2 days (Fig. 1A).
ICL correlate with PR-104A clonogenic cell killing in aerobic
and hypoxic SiHa cells. Consistent with previous reports (18, 19),
PR-104A was selectively toxic to SiHa cells under hypoxia; doseresponse curves for clonogenic cell killing showed a potency
differential between hypoxic and aerobic exposure (hypoxic
cytotoxicity ratio) of 22 (Fig. 1B). Dose-response relationships for
DNA ICL also showed f20-fold higher frequencies under hypoxia
(Fig. 1C), and the relationship between clonogenic cell killing and
ICL 24 hours after PR-104A exposure was similar under aerobic and
hypoxic conditions with f3 logs of cell kill at a DNA cross-link
index of 0.5 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the dose response for
chlorambucil-induced ICL and cell killing (Supplementary Fig. S2)
showed only minor differences between aerobic and hypoxic
exposure (1.2-fold for cell killing; f1.7-fold for ICL); again a DNA
cross-linking index of 0.5 corresponded to f3 logs of cell killing
under both conditions.
PR-104A ICL correlate with clonogenic cell killing in a panel
of human tumor cell lines under hypoxia. We then asked
whether this same relationship held across a panel of nine human
tumor cell lines. Clonogenic survival curves showed little difference
in PR-104A sensitivity between cell lines under hypoxia, with only a
3-fold range in concentrations required for 10% survival (C10;
Fig. 2). Under aerobic conditions, there was a larger 18-fold range
in C10 values, resulting in a f10-fold variation in hypoxic

cytotoxicity ratio values (Fig. 2). For 4 of these cell lines, we followed
the time course of ICL after a 2-hours hypoxic exposure to PR-104A
(Fig. 3A). This showed broadly similar kinetics in each cell line with
rapid ICL formation and slow repair. At 24 hours, residual ICLs were
readily measurable and this time was selected for comparison of all 9
cell lines. The dose response for ICL was similar in all cell lines except
C33A and 22Rv1, which required 2- to 3-fold lower concentrations for
a cross-linking index of 0.5 (Fig. 3B). The relationship between ICL
and clonogenic cell killing under hypoxia (Fig. 3B) was similar to that
for SiHa, and was indistinguishable for all 9 cell lines with an r2 for
the cytotoxicity/ICL correlation of 0.74 (P < 0.001).
Aerobic cytotoxicity of PR-104A is not mediated by ICL in all
cell lines. Under aerobic conditions, higher PR-104A concentrations

www.aacrjournals.org

were required to form ICL than under hypoxia, but much greater
differences between cell lines were now evident (Fig. 3C). Crosslinking frequencies were high in 5 of the lines but were lower in
HCT116 and not detectable in A2780, C33A, or H1299 cells at up to
600 Amol/L PR-104A. Plotting the cross-linking index against
clonogenic cell killing identified these three cell lines as outliers,
with substantial cell killing in the absence of significant cross-linking
(Fig. 3C, points within the dotted oval). Excluding these three cell
lines, there was again a strong correlation between the DNA crosslinking index and clonogenic cell killing (r2 = 0.57; P < 0.001); across
all 9 cell lines (Fig. 3C), the correlation was still significant (P < 0.001)
but weaker than under hypoxia with the r2 value decreasing to 0.34.
These observations suggested that aerobic cytotoxicity of PR-104A is

mediated by ICL in some tumor cell lines but is due to a different
mechanism in A2780, C33A and H1299.
Metabolism of PR-104A to its reduced metabolites by tumor
cell lines. To examine this further, we measured the metabolism of
PR-104A to its cytotoxic reduced metabolites, PR-104H and PR104M, which are considered responsible for the cross-linking
activity of PR-104A (18). To do this, we developed a triple
quadruple mass spectrometry assay using tetradeuterated (d4)
PR-104H as an internal standard. Difficulties in synthesizing
authentic PR-104M required calibrating the mass spectrometry
response by reducing 3H-PR-104A with hypoxic SiHaCYPOR cells
that overexpress the one-electron reductase NADPH:cytochrome
P450 oxidoreductase and generate relatively high levels of PR104M (38). Comparison of radioactivity and absorbance of the
PR-104A, PR-104H, and PR-104M high performance liquid chromatography peaks (Supplementary Fig. S3A) showed that molar
extinction coefficients of all three species are indistinguishable at
250 nm (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Comparing the ion counts for PR104H and PR-104M from these fractions showed that PR-104M was
detected with 1.73-fold higher efficiency than PR-104H under the
assay conditions used (Supplementary Fig. S3C), making it possible
to quantify PR-104M using the d0/d4 PR-104H calibration curve.
The assay gave a linear response (Supplementary Fig. S3D) over at
least 3 orders of magnitude from the lower limit of quantitation
(corresponding to 1 nmol/L in the cell culture).
We used this assay to determine steady-state concentrations of
PR-104H and PR-104M at 1 hour. Concentrations of both reduced
metabolites were similar to each other under anoxia (Fig. 4A),
with highest values in SiHa and lowest in A2780. Although this
13-fold difference was significant by ANOVA (P = 0.003), there was
no correlation between reduced metabolites (PR-104H, PR-104M,
or total) and cytotoxicity (C10 values; P > 0.05; r2 = 0.02),
suggesting differences in intrinsic sensitivity to the activated
nitrogen mustards are a larger determinant. Thus, under anoxia,
ICL determined with the comet assay provides a more reliable
biomarker for PR-104A cytotoxicity than levels of active
metabolites.
Oxygen suppressed levels of reduced metabolites in all cell lines,
but much larger differences were now evident (Fig. 4B) with a
f137-fold range between A2780 and the fastest metabolizer, A549.
Notably, the four cell lines with the slowest rate of aerobic
reduction of PR-104A (A2780, C33A, H1299, and HCT116) were the
lines with low levels of ICL (Fig. 3C), although the linear regression
between reduced metabolites and cytotoxicity under aerobic
conditions did not reach significance (P = 0.09; r2 = 0.34).
PR-104 forms hypoxia-dependent ICL in SiHa tumor
xenografts. We then tested whether the alkaline comet assay
could detect DNA cross-links in human tumor xenografts under
conditions providing monotherapy antitumor activity. After
treatment of mice with PR-104 at 175 mg/kg, ICL were maximal
at 4 to 6 hours, consistent with kinetics in vitro, although
subsequent unhooking of cross-links seemed to be more rapid
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). This might reflect faster elimination of
dead cells with ICL in tumors than in culture. PR-104 showed a
linear dose response for ICL formation up to at least 450 mg/kg in
SiHa tumors when assayed 6 hours after treatment (Fig. S4B).
To modify the level of hypoxia in SiHa tumors, we placed mice in
95% O2/5% CO2 (carbogen), air, or 10% O2/90% N2 for 2 hours after
dosing with the hypoxia marker pimonidazole and assessed its
binding in tumors by immunohistochemistry. Estimated hypoxic
fractions were 9.4%, 16.1%, and 45.9% for mice breathing carbogen,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (9). May 1, 2009

air, and 10% O2, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). These gas
mixtures were then used for 2 hours after each dose of PR-104 on a
weekly 3 schedule. Hyperoxic gas breathing suppressed monotherapy activity of PR-104, whereas the hypoxic gas mixture
increased its activity (Fig. 5A). We determined ICL frequency in fine
needle aspirate samples from the same tumors, 6 hours after the
first dose of PR-104, and in a second experiment in which separate
mice were used to determine tumor growth delay and ICL (Fig. 5B).
This showed a strong correlation between ICL frequency and
tumor growth delay, and confirmed that ICL formation depends on
the level of hypoxia in this tumor model.
PR-104 cross-links correlate with clonogenic cell killing in
xenografts. The above results suggest that ICL may provide a
pharmacodynamic biomarker of PR-104 activity in tumors.
However, in vitro studies showed that ICL are not universally
predictive of cytotoxicity under aerobic conditions across all cell
lines. To test whether ICL provide a reliable pharmacodynamic
biomarker across tumor types in vivo, we determined ICL and
clonogenic cell killing in the same 9 cell lines, grown as xenografts
in nude mice, 24 hours after a single i.p. dose of PR-104. This
showed a strong correlation (r2 = 0.75; P < 0.001) between ICL and
clonogenic cell killing across all 9 cell lines (Fig. 6).

for 2 h immediately after each PR-104 injection. Mice breathing carbogen also received nicotinamide (500 mg/kg, i.p.) 15 min before PR-104. Points, mean for

Discussion
The present study shows that PR-104A induces ICL in a hypoxiaselective manner in all nine human tumor cell lines investigated,
and that ICL correlate with clonogenic cell killing under hypoxia
across this cell line panel (Fig. 3B). This is strong evidence that ICL
formation is the dominant mechanism of PR-104A cytotoxicity in
hypoxic tumor cells, as intended in its design. Our findings are
consistent with the earlier demonstration that Chinese hamster
ovary cells with mutant XPF (defective in the unhooking of ICL)
show marked (f25-fold) hypersensitivity to the reduced metabolite PR-104H (18).
Coupled with evidence for replication arrest at PR-104A–
derived ICL, as shown by gH2AX (18, 40), this suggests that PR104A disrupts the DNA replication fork and thus shares a
common downstream mechanism with many other cytotoxins
(topoisomerase poisons, chain-terminating antimetabolites, and
cross-linking agents such as platins, mitomycin C, and nitrogen
mustards). Given the critical importance of these agents in
cancer therapy, the replication fork is arguably the most
important molecular target in oncology at present (28, 41),
and has clinically validated (if incompletely understood) tumor
selectivity that seems to reside in the alterations in cell cycle
progression, replication stress, and defects in the resolution of
stalled replication forks by homologous recombination in tumor
cells (41, 42). In fact, recent studies suggest that chronic hypoxia
suppresses translation of key proteins required for homologous
recombination, resulting in sensitization to ICL and radiation
(43). However, cells that are only transiently hypoxic may be
more important in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance
(9). PR-104 provides a strategy for exploiting the sensitivity of
chronically hypoxic cells to DNA cross-links but also superimposes a hypoxia-selective release mechanism that ensures
highly cytotoxic levels of DNA cross-links in both acutely and

chronically hypoxic cells. This selective prodrug activation is
clearly the main contributor to selective hypoxic cell killing by
PR-104A when cell cultures are made acutely hypoxic as shown
by much weaker hypoxic selectivity of chlorambucil (Supplementary Fig. S2) and by the demonstration that PR-104H lacks
hypoxic selectivity under similar conditions.3
PR-104A is metabolized to PR-104H at a much lower rate in
aerobic than hypoxic SiHa and MDA-231 cells (18, 38). A surprising
finding in the present study was that aerobic bioreductive
metabolism is highly variable between human tumor cell lines
(Fig. 4B); we have recently identified the enzyme responsible for
this metabolism as aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (44). Cell lines lacking
this two-electron reductase (A2780, C33A, H1299, and HCT116)
show little or no cross-linking after aerobic exposure to PR-104A,
whereas substantial cytotoxicity is still observed (Fig. 3C). These
results clearly establish that cross-linking by PR-104A is due to its
bioreductive metabolism but also show that there is a second (as
yet unidentified) mechanism of cytotoxicity in cell lines lacking the
aerobic reductase. Whatever the mechanism of cross-link–independent aerobic cytotoxicity in culture, it seems not to contribute
significantly in tumors at pharmacologically relevant exposures
given that we found a strong correlation between ICL and killing
across all cell lines when treated with PR-104 as xenografts (Fig. 6).
This validates ICL frequency as a surrogate end point for
clonogenic cell killing in tumors. The alkaline comet assay is
well-validated for quantifying ICL (45–47). Notably, in the present
study, we show that ICL frequency is a better biomarker than
PR-104H/M metabolite levels in culture, suggesting that the
downstream marker (cross-links) is likely to be more useful than

Figure 6. Relationship between DNA cross-links and
clonogenic cell killing in nine human tumor cell lines grown as
s.c. xenografts. Tumors (mean diameter, 8–10 mm) were
assayed 24 h after a single i.p. dose of PR-104 at
350 mg/kg. Each point is for a single tumor. Solid line, first

tumor metabolite levels in support of clinical development. In
addition, the much longer half-life of nitrogen mustard cross-links
than initial reactive metabolites makes ICL frequency more
practical as a response biomarker.
It is noteworthy that PR-104 showed broad spectrum activity
against human tumor xenografts as monotherapy after treatment
at just 45% of the maximum tolerated dose (Fig. 6). Monotherapy
activity was also observed for SiHa tumors using growth delay end
points (Fig. 5A) as previously described (18). This activity would
not be expected for a HAP that only eliminates the hypoxic
subpopulation. We have recently shown, using flow cytometry to
quantify pimonidazole binding, that the hypoxic fraction of the
tumors in the xenograft panel used in the present study is in the
range 10% to 62% (data not shown), which is too low to account for
the monotherapy activity of PR-104 (>90% kill) for 22Rv1, A549,
SiHa, and H460 tumors in Fig. 6. This raises the critical question as
to how PR-104 kills aerobic tumor cells; the evidence from the
present study suggests this reflects both aerobic nitroreduction to
PR-104H/M and a bystander effect due to their diffusion from
hypoxic zones.
The key observation suggesting a role for aerobic nitroreduction is
that the most sensitive tumors (SiHa, A549, H460, and 22Rv1) were
those with high rates of aerobic metabolism in culture. The
relationship between aerobic metabolism in cell lines (Fig. 4B) and
monotherapy activity in the present study (Fig. 6), although
significant, is weak (P = 0.032; r2 = 0.505 for first order regression of
log PR-104H+M against log cell kill), as is also the case for aerobic
cytotoxicity in culture (C10 values in Fig. 2) versus log cell kill in tumors
(P = 0.042; r2 = 0.470). This leaves open the possibility that hypoxic
metabolism also plays a part in monotherapy activity of PR-104.

The present study provides evidence that hypoxia is also
involved in the monotherapy activity of PR-104. Thus suppressing
hypoxia in SiHa tumors using carbogen/nicotinamide after PR-104
inhibited antitumor activity and ICL formation, whereas increasing
tumor hypoxia using 10% oxygen enhanced antitumor activity and
ICLs (Fig. 5). Even under conditions of hypoxic breathing,
monotherapy activity seems too great to be accounted for by
killing of the 46% of cells that are positive for pimonidazole binding
(Supplementary Table S1), suggesting the existence of a bystander
effect. This is consistent with a previous pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic modeling study that suggested tumor cell
killing in SiHa xenografts to be too great to explain without a
bystander effect (19). Further studies will be required to clarify the
relative contribution of these two pathways (aerobic activation and
hypoxic activation with a bystander effect) to the activity of PR-104
in both monotherapy and combination settings.
