BACKGROUND: IDH1 and IDH2 gene mutations are novel, recurring molecular aberrations among patients with normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Among 358 patients with AML treated on 4 protocols
using high-dose ara-C plus idarubicin induction, pretreatment samples were available for 170 (median age 53 years,
[range, 17-73]; 96% 65) and were evaluated for IDH1R132, IDH2R172, and IDH2R140 mutations or the codon 105 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IDH1. RESULTS: IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were present in 12 (7%) and 24 (14%)
of patients, and IDH1 G105 SNP in 24 (14%). Overall, 52 (30%) patients had IDH gene alterations. There was no association with complete response (CR), remission duration, overall survival, and event-free survival and any of the IDH
alterations, and no association with a higher CR rate or survival with the 4 regimens for the 52 patients with aberrant
IDH. Among the patients with diploid karyotype and NPM1mutFLT3WTgenotype, those with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations
had an inferior outcome. CONCLUSIONS: IDH aberrations and IDH1 codon 105 SNP occur in about 30% of younger
patients with AML, mostly with diploid karyotype. Using high-dose ara-C-based induction regimens, we did not

INTRODUCTION
Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a member of the b-decarboxylating dehydrogenase family of enzymes and catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into a-ketoglutarate (a-KG) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, an important biochemical pathway in the synthesis of nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids.1 Three isoforms of the IDH
enzymes with different subcellular localization have been described in mammalian cells: IDH1 is localized in the cytoplasm and the peroxisomes, whereas IDH2 and IDH3 are mitochondrial enzymes.2 These enzymes use nicotanomide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or NAD phosphate as cofactors to catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to a-KG yielding
NADH or NADPH as a result.
Recent interest in this family of enzymes in relation to carcinogenesis is based on the initial observations in colorectal
cancer and gliomas with several reports of recurring mutations in the IDH1 gene on chromosome band 2q33.3 and the
IDH2 gene on chromosome band 15q26.1 in patients with grade II and III gliomas and, in particular, secondary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) developing from lower grade gliomas.3-7 Overall, these mutations have been associated with a
longer survival in patients with GBM.
The IDH mutations identified in brain tumors (and in patients with AML) alter the amino acid residues R132 in
IDH1 and R172 and R140 in IDH2. The mutated enzyme protein products have been associated with a loss of function
in the forward reaction that decorboxylates isocitrate as well as a gain of function in the reverse reaction that reduces a-KG

to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG).8 Both these loss and gain of
function reactions have significant implications for cellular metabolism with 2HG potentially deregulating several
a-KG-dependent enzymes and transcription factors, such
as HIF-1a, implicated in carcinogenesis.9,10
Initial studies failed to detect mutations of the IDH
genes in patients with leukemia.6,11,12 Recently, Mardis et
al13 examined the entire genome sequence of leukemia
cells from a single patient with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) with normal cytogenetics (CN-AML) comparing
it with the sequence from normal skin cells from the same
patient. Among 750 possible mutations, several (including mutations in NPM1 and NRAS, as well as IDH1) were
recurrent in other AML genomes, suggesting their potential role in leukemogenesis.13 This had led to several
groups investigating the incidence and prognostic implications of mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 in patients with
AML (particularly those with normal karyotype) in an
effort to further improve stratification of these patients
and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
These studies have reported conflicting associations
between the presence of these mutations and clinical
outcomes.
In a study by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB), leukemia cells from a third of 358 patients
examined harbored the IDH1 or IDH2 mutation.14
Among the younger patients (<60 years) with molecular
low-risk group (mutated NPM1 but without fms-like tyrosine kinase-3- internal tandem duplication [FLT3-ITD]),
patients with mutated IDH1 (IDH1 R132) had a significantly worse disease-free survival (DFS) with a trend for
worse overall survival (OS).14 Patients with R140 IDH2
had no differences in disease outcomes compared with
those with wild-type (WT) IDH1/IDH2, whereas older
patients with R172 IDH2 had a lower complete remission
(CR) rate than those with IDH1/IDH2 WT gene.14
In another study conducted by the German-Austrian AML study group (AMLSG), 129 (16%) of 805
adults (age range, 16-60 years) with AML had 1 of the
IDH mutations.15 Among patients with CN-AML,
mutated NPM1, and FLT3WT AML, IDH mutations
adversely affected relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS,
whereas the outcome was not affected in patients lacking
this genotype.15 In a study by the Acute Leukemia French
Association (ALFA), IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were
identified in 9.6% and 3% of adults with AML with an
association with a worse outcome for IDH2 among the
patients with CN-AML and for IDH2 for those patients
with CN-AML and a favorable genotype (NPM1

mutated, FLT3WT).16 Other groups have also reported on
an adverse prognostic effect for IDH mutations as well as
the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1554137
located in codon 105 in the same exon as the IDH1 R132
mutations in patients with CN-AML, particularly those
with NPM1 mutated, FLT3WT genotype.17-19 Although
this SNP does not result in a change in the amino acid
sequence, it has been reported to be associated with a
higher mRNA expression compared with patients with 2
WT alleles.
Here we examined the incidence and prognostic
impact of IDH mutations as well as the G105 polymorphism among 358 younger patients with AML treated
with an induction regimen containing idarubicin, highdose cytarabine with or without tipifarnib, sorafenib, or
vorinostat; we also sought to determine whether any of
the 4 regimens had an impact on the outcome of the IDH
mutated patients. Although IDH1 G105 polymorphism
is not a true aberration and has not been to date shown to
be associated with generation of 2HG, we decided to
include these patients in the analysis due to recent reports
suggesting their negative impact.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment
From October 2004 to February 2010, 358 patients with
newly diagnosed AML were treated on 4 consecutive protocols using high-dose ara-C plus idarubicin induction
therapy (IA alone, IA plus tipifarnib [IAT], IA plus sorafenib [IAS], and IA plus vorinostat [IAV]). The details of
the 4 regimens have been published previously.20-22 All
patients reviewed and signed a consent, approved by The
MD Anderson Cancer Center institutional review board
to participate in the clinical trials and to provide bone
marrow samples for analysis. The induction regimen in all
patients included ara-C 1.5 g/m2 given by 24-hour continuous infusion daily for 4 days (3 days in patients 60
years or older) and idarubicin 12 mg/m2 intravenously
daily for 3 days. Patients received tipifarnib 300 mg twice
daily for 21 days, sorafenib 400 mg twice daily for 7 days,
or vorinostat 500 mg 3 times daily for 3 days, with IAT,
IAS, or IAV regimens, respectively. Patients could receive
up to 2 induction courses and if in CR or CR without platelet recovery (CRp) would proceed to receive consolidation, which consisted of up to 5 courses of idarubicin 8
mg/m2 per day on days 1-2, ara-C 0.75 g/m2 per day on
days 1-3, and tipifarnib, sorafenib, or vorinostat as appropriate to the protocol. Maintenance with tipifarnib,

Patients treated with the IA regimen would receive no further therapy after the completion of the 5 courses of consolidation chemotherapy with no maintenance (Table 1).
It should be further emphasized that cytarabine was
administered by continuous infusion during induction in
all regimens.
Pretreatment samples for testing for IDH1R132,
IDH2R172, and IDH2R140 mutations were available for
170 patients and these are the subjects of this report. Their
median age was 53 years (range, 17-73) and the majority

Table 2.
Molecular Analysis for IDH1 and IDH2
Mutations and SNP
For IDH1, a 214-bp partial exon 4 sequence containing
both G105 and R132 was amplified using a forward
primer within exon 4 and a reverse primer within intron
4. For IDH2, a 288-bp sequence with the entire exon 4
containing R140 and R172 was amplified using forward
primer within intron 3 and a reverse primer within intron
4. All primers were tagged with M13 sequence to allow
Sanger sequencing using M13 primers. This design
allowed interrogation of all 3 active site arginine residues
for both IDH1 (R100, R109, R132) and IDH2 (R140,
R149, R172). The primer sequences were as follows:
M13-IDH1 forward, TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTT
GAGAAGAGGGTTGAGGAGTT; M13-IDH1 reverse,
CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCAACATGCAAAATCAC

GAGGAGCTCCAGT; M13 forward, TGTAAAACG
ACGGCCAGT; M13 reverse, CAGGAAACAGCTA
TGACC.
All Sanger assays were performed bidirectionally
using M13 primers. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing is an
accepted and more stringent way of confirming the presence of a mutation compared with simply repeating a unidirectional sequencing. For Sanger sequencing performed

directly from the DNA aliquot, reaction mixtures of 50
lL contained 1 mM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl2, 200 nM primers, 1.5 U Taq Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, Calif). For each reaction, 200 ng of genomic DNA
was amplified with the following PCR conditions: an initial 10-minute denaturation at 95 C followed by 40 cycles
of 30 seconds at 95 C; 30 seconds at 60 C; 30 seconds at
72 C, and a final extension of 7 minutes at 72 C.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were
purified using Agencourt Ampure magnetic beads kit
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif) prior to quality and quantity assessment by gel electrophoresis. Sequencing analysis
was performed using a multicapillary sequencer (ABI
3130 Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems) following
cycle sequencing using dye-terminator chemistry according to manufacturer’s protocol (BigDye Terminator v1.1
Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing Kit; Applied Biosystems). Briefly, 4 lL of PCR product in a total volume 20
lL containing, 3.2 pmol of either the forward or reverse
M13 primer and 6 lL of the sequencing mixture were
placed in a DNA thermal cycler and amplified at 96 C for
1 minute, 25 cycles at 96 C for 10 seconds, 58 C for 5
seconds, 60 C for 4 minutes, and final hold at 4 C.
Sequencing reactions were purified using the Qiagen
DyeEx purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) as per
manufacturer’s protocol. The resulting data was analyzed
by Seqscape software (Applied Biosystems).

Molecular Analysis for NPM1 and FLT3
Mutations
Mutations in coding regions of exon 12 of NPM1 were
detected using PCR amplification of a 168 base-pair segment followed by capillary gel electrophoresis. PCR primers included forward, 50 -FAM-GATGTCTATGAA
GTGTTGTGGT-TCC-30 and reverse, 50 - GGACAGC
CAGATCAACTG-30 . PCR was performed in a 50-lL
reaction volume that contained 2 lL of patient DNA
(100 ng/lL), 5 lL of 10 ThermoPol Buffer (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass) with magnesium sulfate, 5
lL of 10 mmol/L dNTP, 1 lL of NPM1 forward primer
(10 lmol/L), 1 lL of NPM1 reverse primer (10 lmol/L),
35.2 lL of water, and 0.75 lL of Vent DNA polymerase
(New England Biolabs) (2 U/lL). PCR conditions
included initial denaturing at 95 C for 10 minutes, 40
cycles of 95 C for 30 seconds, 55 C for 30 seconds, and

2668

72 C for 30 seconds, and final extension at 72 C for 7
minutes. PCR products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on a 3100 or 3130 genetic analyzer (Applied
Biosystems).
A multiplex fluorescent-based PCR method was used
to detect ITD and D835 point mutations in FLT3. DNA
was isolated from bone marrow aspirate samples by using a
standard phenol-chloroform extraction method. The presence of ITD was assessed by amplification of the juxtamembrane domain using primers from exons 11 and 12 as
described by Kiyoi and Naoe.23 The presence of D835
point mutations was assessed by a restriction fragment
length polymorphism-mediated assay using primers flanking the mutation site.15 To facilitate the detection of PCR
products by capillary electrophoresis on a 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), forward primers for ITD and D835 were labeled with a fluorescent
dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM).16 The presence of any
PCR fragment larger than the WT allele was considered
positive for ITD. D835 PCR products were digested with
the EcoRV restriction enzyme before capillary electrophoresis. The WT allele cut by this enzyme resulted in 2 fragments of 64 and 48 base pairs. In contrast, mutations at
D835 alter the EcoRV recognition site and result in 1 112
base-pair fragment. The sensitivity of these assays is approximately 2%, that is, 1 mutated cell in 50 total cells, as established by dilutional studies.
Statistical Methods
Patient characteristics are summarized using median
(range) for continuous variables and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. OS is defined as the time
interval between the date of initiation of treatment and
the date of death due to any cause; patients alive at last follow-up are censored at the last follow-up date. Event-free
survival (EFS) is defined as the time interval between the
date of initiation of treatment and date of treatment failure, relapse, or death, whichever occurred first; patients
were otherwise censored at the last follow-up date. The
probabilities of OS and EFS were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and were compared among subgroups of patients using the log-rank test. The predictive
effects of IDH mutations and other patient characteristics
on OS and EFS were examined using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Univariate
and multivariate logistic regression models were also used
to assess the association between patient covariates and
the probability of response. All statistical analyses were
conducted in SAS 9.0.

RESULTS
Incidence of IDH Mutations and the G105 SNP
Mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 were present in 12 (7%)
and 24 (14%) patients, respectively, and IDH1G105 SNP
was noted in 24 (14%). Overall, 52 (30%) patients had
IDH gene mutations or the previously described SNP rs
11554137 in codon 105 of IDH1.17 In concordance with
previous reports IDH1 and IDH2 mutations did not commonly occur in the same patient with the exception of a
single patient who had IDH1R132 mutation, IDH1G105
SNP, and IDH2R140 mutation.14-16 Two patients had
concomitant IDH1R132 mutation and IDH1G105 SNP,
3 patients had IDH2R140 mutation and IDH1G105
SNP, 1 patient IDH2R172 mutation and IDH1G105
SNP. IDH1 mutations were most commonly R132H or
R132C with the exception of 1, which was R132G.

Twenty-four patients had IDH2 mutations, either IDH2
R172 or R140. All IDH2 R172 mutations led to a R172K
substitution.
Association of Clinical Characteristics with
IDH Mutations and SNP
There was a strong association with normal karyotype
with 11 of 12 (92%) of IDH1 mutated, 18 of 24 (75%) of
IDH2 mutated, and 17 of 24 (71%) of IDH1 SNP being
diploid (Table 3). There was no association between any
of the IDH alterations and patient age, sex, therapyrelated versus de novo AML, presenting white blood cell
(WBC), peripheral blood blasts, or French-AmericanBritish (FAB) subtype.
Among the 52 patients with IDH mutation or SNP,
12 had FLT3-ITD, 5 FLT3-TKD (including 2 patients

2669

Original Article

with both ITD, and TKD), and 21 had NPM1 mutation.
There was a strong association between IDH1 and IDH2
mutations, and NPM1 mutations (P ¼ .0004 and .04,
respectively). However, 12 of 52 patients with IDH alterations also had FLT3-ITD compared with 24 of 116
patients with IDHWT (P ¼ NS). The favorable genotype,
diploid, NPM1mut, and FLT3 WT occurred in 9 patients.

Association of IDH Mutations with Outcome
of Therapy
There was no association with achievement of CR, remission duration, overall, and EFS and either of the IDH
mutations or IDH1 SNP (Fig. 1A, B, and C). Similarly,
combining all patients with IDH mutations or SNP
G105, we were not able show any difference in survival,
EFS, or CR duration (Fig. 2A, B, and C). Furthermore,
there was no association with a higher CR rate or survival
among any of the 4 different regimens for the 52 patients
with IDH gene mutations or IDH1 SNP. On univariate
analysis for response, EFS, and OS having IDH1, or
IDH2 mutations or any IDH aberration was not significantly associated with the outcome and predictors known
to be important such as cytogenetics, NPM1mut/FLT3wt
genotype, and de novo versus secondary AML were significant on the multivariate model (data not shown).

IDH Mutations and Outcome in Molecular
Subsets
Among the 104 patients with diploid cytogenetics, IDH1
mutations occurred in 11 (11%), IDH2 mutations in 18
(17%), and G105 SNP in 17 (16%) of patients. The presence of IDH1 or IDH2 mutations or the IDH1 SNP did
not affect the outcome and was not significant on univariate analysis (data not shown). However, among the 23
patients with diploid karyotype and the favorable genotype of NPM1mutFLT3WT, those with IDH1R132,
IDH2R140, or IDH2R172 had a significantly worse survival compared with those without these mutations (Fig.
3A and B). However, the outcome of the patients with the
diploid cytogenetics and the favorable genotype
NPM1mutFLTWT was not affected by the presence or absence of the G105 SNP. Furthermore, among the patients
with diploid cytogenetics who were FLT3 mutated, presence of IDH1 mutation (but not IDH1 SNP G105 or
IDH2 mutations) was associated with an improved outcome although this was based on a small number of
patients (Fig. 3C).

Association of Outcome of Therapy with the
4 Regimens Used in the Molecular Subsets
We also examined whether any of the 4 regimens used to
treat the patients (IA, IAT, IAS, or IAV) had an impact on
the response rate or survival of patients with IDH1, IDH2
mutations, or G105 SNP and did not find any correlation
with a better or worse outcome among the 4 regimens.

DISCUSSION
Identification of IDH1 mutations by sequencing the
whole leukemia genome of a patient with diploid AML
has generated significant interest in the IDH genes and
their potential role in leukemogenesis.10,13,24 IDH mutations were previously described in patients with glioma
where they are associated with a more favorable outcome.4,25 A number of studies have suggested that these
mutations may be an early event in the oncogenesis of secondary GBM.24 Similarly, a number of reports have
shown a low incidence of these mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative disorders but have suggested a possible role for them in
transformation into acute leukemia.26-28
In AML, a number of groups have examined the
incidence and clinico-pathological features of these mutations in patients, particularly those with diploid cytogenetics.13-19,29,30 These studies have suggested that IDH1
and IDH2 mutations each occur in 5% to 15% of patients
with a strong association with the diploid karyotype. The
IDH1 SNP in codon G105 occurs in about 12% of cytogenetically normal patients and healthy volunteers and is
associated with an inferior outcome with the impact most
pronounced among those with the high-risk genotype
(NPMWT or FLT3-ITD positive).17
In the current study, we detected IDH1 and IDH2
mutations in 12 (7%) and 24 (14%) of patients (overall
21%) and IDH1 G105 in another 24 (14%) of patients.
Among the patients with diploid cytogenetics, IDH1 mutations occurred in 11 (11%), IDH2 mutations in 18 (17%),
and G105 SNP in 17 (16%) of patients. Overall, the presence of the mutations and/or the G105 SNP was not associated with any impact on the achievement of CR, EFS,
and OS. Similarly, among the patients with diploid cytogenetics (n ¼ 104), the presence of these IDH alterations did
not affect any of the outcome measures adversely. However,
when we examined the group of patients with diploid
karyotype and the favorable genotype of NPM1mut/
FLT3WT (n ¼ 23), patients with either IDH1 or IDH2
mutations had a significantly worse survival than those

2672

without the mutations but the presence of G105 SNP did
not affect the outcome, although it should be stressed that
these findings are in small numbers of patients.
Our results are consistent with those from other
investigators reporting the incidence of these mutations as
about 5% to 15% (overall up to 30%) of patients with
AML with a strong association with those with cytogenetically normal disease.14-16,19,29,30 The variations among
the various reports is likely due to different patient populations including differences in the age of the patients evaluated in the studies. We also detected a similar incidence
of the G105 SNP among the patients with AML as was
previously reported by Wagner et al,17 but failed to show
an adverse prognostic impact on survival as suggested by
them. Overall, alterations in the IDH genes account for a
sizable proportion of patients, particularly those with normal cytogenetics and appear to have an impact on survival
among those with a favorable genotype of NPM1mut/
FLT3WT. This is considerable importance in further refining the prognosis of this group of patients and the potential for different forms of postremission therapy.
Importantly, we also were not able to show any impact of
the selection of the 4 different treatment regimens on the
outcome of patients with IDH alterations.
Further studies on the role of IDH enzymes in cellular metabolism is likely to provide further insight into the
association of the IDH gene alterations with diploid karyotype AML and their impact on the outcome of the subset
with NPM1 but without FLT3 ITD mutations. In gliomas,
1 possible theory of the improved outcome of the patients
with IDH1 mutation is sensitization of the glioma cells to
chemotherapy and radiation through the reduction of intracellular pools of NADPH.31 If this were to be a true mechanism in gliomas, the paradox in AML where, among the
patients with favorable genotype, those with IDH mutations appear to have a worse outcome has to be reconciled.
Other important effects of the deregulated IDH function
such as reduction of decorboxylation of isocitrate to a-KG
as well as increased conversion of a-KG to 2HG may be
potentially responsible for their prognostic influence in specific subsets; recent studies have demonstrated the accumulation of 2HG in AML cells.32,33 A potential hypothesis is
that, through its structural similarities to a-KG, 2HG competitively inhibits several a-KG-dependent enzymes important in leukemogenesis. A recent report suggested that IDH
mutated AML cells display global DNA hypermethylation
with a specific signature, and expression of 2HG producing
IDH alleles in cells induced global hypermethylation.34 The
authors further demonstrated that loss-of-function

mutations in TET2, an a-KG-dependent enzyme, also produced similar methylation defects as IDH mutants and
expression of mutatnt IDH1/2 or depletion of TET2
resulted in impaired hematopoietic differentiation.34
