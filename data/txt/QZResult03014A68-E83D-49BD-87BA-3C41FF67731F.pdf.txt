Scaling Laws for Plasma Concentrations and
Tolerable Doses of Anticancer Drugs
Thomas H. Dawson

Abstract
General scaling laws are developed for projecting measurements of the plasma concentrations of anticancer
drugs from laboratory animals to humans and among humans of different sizes. Associated scaling laws for
critical drug doses are established from these laws. Broad categories of single and periodic i.v. bolus dosings
are considered. Validity of the relations is shown using measurement from the literature for several wellknown cytotoxic agents. The scaling theory is also shown to apply to novel anticancer drugs now available
or presently under development, as represented by the p.o. administered prodrug capecitabine, the gene silencing inhibitor zebularine, and the blood vessel inhibitor bevacizumab. Scaling considerations for the modern practice of combination chemotherapy are also discussed. Cancer Res; 70(12); 4801–8. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Because of critical dosing requirements in cancer chemotherapy, it is general practice to express recommended doses
of anticancer drugs in terms of body surface area rather than
body mass so that presumably safe, yet effective, doses for
individuals can be determined more precisely than otherwise. Involved here is not only dosage determination in clinical practice but also the scaling of tolerable doses from
laboratory animals to humans for guidance with starting
doses in clinical trials. The physical basis for this dosing
practice rests in the plausible assumption that drugs are
used and expended in the body by basic physiologic processes that vary with body surface area rather than body weight
(1). Although various studies (1, 2) have provided a general
endorsement for this concept, measurements of critical
doses of laboratory animals and humans, when referenced
to their body surface areas, have often differed appreciably
from one another, contrary to the equal values expected.
For example, for the well-known agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
and a schedule of 1 dose per day for 5 days, Freireich and
colleagues (2) reported measured maximum tolerable doses
for the monkey and human of about 210 and 500 mg/m2, respectively. These and other measurements thus indicate that
the matter of scaling of drug doses from laboratory animals
to humans and among humans of different sizes is not yet a
settled matter and that the subject can benefit from further
study.

tion between the time history of concentrations of the anticancer agent methotrexate in the blood of mouse and
human. Recent further work on this subject has, in fact,
now revealed a more general scaling theory for concentration-time measurements as well as related scaling laws for
drug dosage that ensure similar systemic exposure for both
single and periodically administered agents. The purpose of
the present article is to discuss these new developments.

Materials and Methods
Materials used in this work are mainly measurements of
the time history of plasma concentrations and critical doses
of various anticancer agents, as reported in the literature.
The overall method of the present work involves (a) development and confirmation of a general algebraic relation
describing plasma concentrations of anticancer agents,
and (b) application of this relation in establishing scaling
laws for projecting critical doses of these agents from
small mammals to humans and among humans of different
sizes.

Results
Scaling theory for plasma concentrations
The algebraic description of the time history of drug concentrations in the blood is developed here in a relatively general form that is independent of many of the details of the
contributing processes. In particular, a drug of initial mass
MD is first assumed to be injected fully into an element of
blood as it passes the injection site. Following injection, a
basic process is envisioned where exchange of water and
drug with surroundings occurs as the element passes
through the capillary system and where, after the first few
rounds of circulation, the entire amount of drug initially
in the element has been removed and some of it returned,
with a tendency toward uniform distribution in the blood.

The time for the process will of course equal the product of
the time for a complete cycle of circulation, say T, and the
number of cycles, say N, needed before this condition is
reached.
The mass of drug ΔMD returned after the initial number of
cycles of blood circulation can be considered to be proportional to the net volume of the mixture of water and drug
that is reabsorbed into the plasma over the time NT. The latter is described by the product of this time and the net inflow
Q of the mixture. The actual drug mass ΔMD reabsorbed
must then equal this product QNT when multiplied by the
average drug mass per unit volume of the mixture, and this,
in turn, can be expected to be proportional to the initial drug
mass MD per unit volume of plasma VP. On dividing ΔMD and
QNT by the plasma volume, the governing proportional relation (with symbol ∝ denoting proportionality) may thus be
written as
ΔMD MD QNT
∝
VP
VP VP

ðAÞ

During this early stage, plasma protein binding with the
drug can occur and effectively remove some of the drug from
further action. This can be accounted for by including a factor U on the right side of this relation (Eq. A) that denotes the
fraction of unbound drug left after the binding process. In
addition, plasma volume may be replaced by body mass M
on the right-hand side of this proportional relation, consistent with known variation among mammals of different sizes
(5). Physiologic scaling theory developed in earlier work by
the author (3–7) further requires that the flow Q across capillary walls must scale with body mass to the power 5/6 and
that the time for circulation T must scale as body mass to the
1/4th power. The product QT must therefore vary with M to
the 13/12th power.
With additional cycles of circulation, a reduction of drug in
the blood will occur as a result of additional transfer processes in the capillaries. This continuing decrease in the concentration can be described in terms of time t by a factor f (t/NT),
where f (-) denotes a function of the dimensionless time t/NT
(denoting the number of groups of N cycles that have occurred up to time t). The concentration of drug C (in units
of drug mass per unit volume of plasma) may thus be expressed as

together with the condition that the ratio t/NT is the same
for human and laboratory animal.
For the case of “complex drug behavior,” where one or
both of the factors U and N are different for the human
and laboratory animal, the scaling relations may be written
from Eq. C as

Because variables associated with time aspects of concentration measurements from laboratory animals can usually
be represented by so-called allometric relations involving
body mass raised to a fixed power (8), it can be expected
from Eq. E that the ratio of circulation factors can similarly
be so represented. This is indeed the case, as will be seen
below.
The validity of Eqs. D and E is illustrated in Fig. 1 for concentration data (mg/L per mg/kg) reported by Mitsuhashi
and colleagues (9) for an i.v. bolus injection of the anticancer
agent nimustine hydrochloride. Here, adjustment was made
for measured total (rather than unbound) concentrations.

where D denotes the initial drug mass per unit of body
mass.
Now, if the ratio t/NT is fixed in this relation (Eq. B), the
value of the function f (-) will also be fixed and the ratio on
the left-hand side of this relation must then be proportional
to the first ratio on the right. This provides the scaling law for
the normalized concentration C/D as a function of time.
Thus, the ratio C/D when multiplied by the ratio M/UQNT
must equal the constant proportionality factor implied by
Eq. B. Using the above-noted dependence of the product
QT on body mass, the scaling law for the relative concentra-

laboratory animal (subscript M) as

Calculations provided values of U H /U M for human and
mouse (1.6) and human and dog (2.5), and the concentration
data indicated that NH/NM must vary with MH/MM to the
power −0.10.
Pharmacokinetic variables. Directly connected with the
scaling of concentration data are the associated scaling laws
for various pharmacokinetic variables. These follow from the

For the case of “simple drug behavior” (factors U and N

times T*, clearance Cl, and volumes V must scale with body

Scaling theory for single i.v. bolus doses
Significant results associated with scaling laws for drug
dosage follow from the above general description of plasma
concentrations. Attention is restricted first to single i.v. bolus
doses. The similarity condition for drug dosing is assumed to
be as follows: that the plasma concentrations C of the human
and laboratory animal (or another human) must be the same
at corresponding times t/NT.
The requirement for this “similar-exposure” condition follows from Eq. B such that

for unit conversion (5).
For illustration of applicability of Eq. J, attention may be
directed to critical doses of drugs from the platinum anticancer agents, as reported by Clark and colleagues (10).
Single i.v. bolus doses were used in the study. Measurements
for the dog and human (with assumed body masses of 8 and
70 kg, respectively) are found here to follow well the predic-

tions from Eq. J for the case of simple drug behavior (UM = UH
and NM = NH). Results are shown in Fig. 2 where measurements of the critical (maximum tolerated) dose for humans
are compared with predictions from measurements on dogs
when determined only from body surface area (no scaling)
and, alternatively, from Eq. J. The latter clearly shows superior agreement with the measurements.
Scaling theory for periodic i.v. bolus doses
Attention is next directed to periodically administered i.v.
doses, with the rate of drug dose DR defined as ΔD/Δt, where
Δt denotes the interval between injections of amount ΔD
(per unit of body mass, as earlier). In the usual way, Δt
and the total number of injections, say n, then define the
schedule for dosing. The scaling law for rate of drug dose
in the human in terms of that for the laboratory animal
can be determined from the basic relation of Eq. B when D
is replaced by DRΔt and the function f is expanded to include
the ratio Δt/NT and the number n of doses given, that is,

Now, the similarity condition here for periodic drug dosing
among humans and laboratory animals is assumed to be an
expanded version of that for single dosing, namely, that the
plasma concentrations C of the human and laboratory animal (or another human) must be the same at corresponding
times t/NT when the ratio Δt/NT and the number of doses n
are fixed.
Requirements for this similar-exposure condition within
the framework of the present theory can be determined in

An interesting result from Eqs. L and M arises for the case
of simple drug behavior (UM = UH and NM = NH), where Eq. L
reduces to the condition that the rate of drug dose per unit of
body surface area is the same for human and laboratory animal. This is a noteworthy result because it is based on fundamental physiologic processes and yet provides a basis for
scaling of drug dosage with body surface area, such as that
discussed in the introductory remarks. Of course, it is now
seen from Eq. M (with NH = NM) that a restriction on drug
schedules accompanies this scaling law such that the time
interval between injections must scale with body mass to
the 1/4th power and, with a fixed total number of injections,
that the total period for injections must similarly scale in this
manner. That scaling of drug schedules should accompany
scaling of critical doses from laboratory animals to humans
was recognized and discussed earlier by Mordenti (11).
Approximate formula. For an approximate adjustment of
the theory to account for a fixed schedule for both humans
and larger laboratory animals such as dogs and monkeys, the
strict requirement of precise similarity of concentration-time
histories for human and laboratory animal may be relaxed,
and the average value of the ratios Δt/NT for the two may
be assumed in the function f of Eq. K. In this case, drug dosage is based on similarity of an average concentration-time
history, and Eq. K then requires (with n constant and ΔtM =
ΔtH = Δt) the single scaling relation

This approximate equation for periodic rate of dosing is similar to the exact relation of Eq. J for single i.v. bolus doses and
becomes identical to it when both sides of Eq. N are multiplied by the common interval Δt.
For illustration of the adequacy of Eq. N for periodic dosing with fixed schedule, attention may be directed back to
the introductory remarks on studies of 5-FU with a dosing
schedule of 1 dose per day for 5 days. The maximum tolerated doses for the monkey and human were noted to be approximately 210 and 500 mg/m2 per day, respectively. Using
Eq. N, with the assumption of simple drug behavior (UM = UH
and N M = N H ), the dose for the monkey (M M = 3 kg)
when scaled to the human (MH = 70 kg) is found equal to
460 mg/m2 per day and, thus, is consistent with the measurements (within 8% or so).

Applications of theory
It is of interest to apply the scaling theory of the present
work to measurements from some relatively new agents for
cancer chemotherapy, as represented here by the now available antitumor agents capecitabine and bevacizumab and by
the experimental antitumor drug zebularine, presently under
development. Such applications are discussed below. In addition, scaling theory and application are discussed for the
modern practice of combination chemotherapy.
(a) P.o. administered drugs: capecitabine. Work here has
thus far been concerned with scaling laws for i.v. bolus administration of anticancer agents. In contrast, results are
presented here for capecitabine, an agent that allows p.o. administration and also has novel antitumor activity because of
its ability to change from a relatively inactive substance, as
administered, to the antitumor agent 5-FU (discussed above)
at the tumor site.
Onodera and colleagues (12) have provided measurements
of the plasma concentrations of capecitabine after single p.o.
administrations to monkeys and mice. These data may be
examined using the scaling laws of Eqs. D and E, with subscripts MK (monkey) and MS (mouse) momentarily replacing
H and M. Assuming typical values of body mass of the monkey MMK and mouse MMS of 3 and 0.02 kg, respectively, inspection of the data shows that these equations will apply
when the nonbinding fractions UMK and UMS are equal and
when the ratio N MK/NMS is equal to the ratio MMK/MMS
raised to the power −0.08. Results from this scaling are
shown in Fig. 3 using measurements from the mouse with
a dose of 539 mg/kg and from the monkey with doses as indicated. The agreement can be seen to be good.

Scaling Laws for Tolerable Doses of Anticancer Drugs

The approximate relation for scaling dose rate from monkey to human with fixed dosing schedule follows from Eq. N
on assuming descriptions for nonbinding fractions and circulation numbers like that described above. Evidence that it is
applicable can be found in the work of Cassidy and colleagues (13) and Budman and colleagues (14) for twice-daily
dosing of monkeys and humans over an extended period of
4 to 6 weeks. Here, the highest nontoxic dose rate for the
monkey (MM = 3 kg) was observed to be approximately
520 mg/m2 per day. Equation N accordingly provides the
scaled value for the human (MH = 70 kg) of 1,470 mg/m2
per day, and this compares favorably with the measured
value of 1,330 mg/m2 per day for the human.
(b) Gene silencing inhibitor: zebularine. The experimental agent zebularine is a small-molecule inhibitor that acts to
limit the cancer-induced silencing of tumor suppressor
genes. Holleran and colleagues (15) have reported measurements of the time history of plasma concentrations of zebularine for mice and monkeys following i.v. bolus injection,
and it is worthwhile to examine these measurements in
terms of the present work. Again, it is convenient to momentarily let subscripts MK (monkey) and MS (mouse) replace H
and M in Eqs. D and E. Inspection of the data suggests that
UMK = UMS and that the ratio NMK/NMS must vary with the
ratio MMK/MMS raised to the power −0.05. Figure 4 shows application of the scaling equations D and E when data from
the mouse (with body mass MMS = 0.02 kg) for single i.v. bolus dose of 100 mg/kg are scaled to the monkey (with body
mass MMK = 7 kg) and compared with direct measurements
for a dose of 500 mg/kg. It can be seen that the scaled and
measured values agree well with one another.

Figure 4. Measurement of time history of plasma concentrations of
zebularine in mouse and monkey and values from the mouse when
scaled to the monkey using Eqs. D and E. Basic data source: ref. 15.

www.aacrjournals.org

Regarding effective and tolerable dosings of zebularine,
Cheng and colleagues (16) have shown that daily p.o. administration of 2,720 mg/m2 of this drug to tumor-bearing mice
is associated with a decrease in tumor volume of about 20%
over an 18-day treatment period, in contrast with about a
250% increase for similar untreated mice. In the work referred to above, Holleran and colleagues have further shown
that the percentage of p.o. administered zebularine that finds
its way to the blood is only about 7%, so that a safe yet
effective daily i.v. dose for the mouse can be expected to
be about 190 mg/m2 per day for some 18 days.
For comparison purposes, this effective i.v. dose and schedule can be scaled to that for the human using exact scaling
theory as represented by Eqs. L and M. Results are as follows:
dose rate = 430 mg/m2 per day with interval of 5.11 days and
total dosing period of 18 × 5.11 = 92 days. The actual dose per
interval is of course 5.11 × 430 = 2,200 mg/m2, and consistent
with the dosing of the mice, this dose is to be administered at
the beginning of each of the 18 intervals.
(c) Blood vessel inhibitor: bevacizumab. The relatively
new agent bevacizumab is an anticancer drug that acts to
block the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumor
growth. In a preclinical study of its pharmacokinetics, Lin
and colleagues (17) have determined time histories of its
plasma concentrations for mouse and monkey, and Gordon
and colleagues (18) have given clinical data for humans.
These measurements can be compared with predictions
from Eqs. D and E. Inspection indicates a characterization
similar to that just discussed for zebularine. In particular,
the unbound fractions can be assumed equal and the ratio
NH/NM assumed equal to the ratio MH/MM to the power
−0.06. Application of these equations is illustrated in Fig. 5
where measurements from the mouse (M M = 0.02 kg)
and monkey (MM = 3.5 kg) have been scaled to the human
(MH = 70 kg) and compared with corresponding measurements. It can be seen that the agreement is good and very
supportive of the theory.
With regard to toxic doses, Ryan and colleagues (19) have
reported studies on monkeys where no signs of toxicity were
observed for twice-weekly i.v. bolus doses of 58 mg/m2 per
week over a period of 4 weeks. It is of interest to use the
present theory to determine the scaled value of this dose
for humans. With the results leading to the scaling predictions shown in Fig. 5, and with the dosing interval for the
monkey as ΔtM = 0.5 week, Eq. M gives the value of the
corresponding interval for the human as 0.91 week, and
Eq. L gives the dose for the human as 84.6 mg/m2 per week,
or 77 mg/m2 for each of the 8 intervals.
(d ) Combination chemotherapy. In the case where two or
more anticancer agents are combined for improved therapy,
the scaling theory is more involved. Scaling is, however,
still possible under special circumstances. This matter is illustrated here for the case of combination chemotherapy with
capecitabine and bevacizumab. With combination chemotherapy, it is generally required that the agents do not interact
with one another, that their basic processes for therapeutic
action are different, and that their toxicities do not overlap.
This is the case with capecitabine and bevacizumab.

In considering dosage scaling so as to provide similar
exposure of the combination of agents (independent of body
size), Eq. K may first be considered to describe the concentrations of capecitabine by tagging the variables DR, Δt, U, N, and
n, as well as the function f, in this relation with subscript C.
Likewise, for description of the concentration of bevacizumab, the same may be done using subscript B. Now, for
similarity of exposure, both descriptions must depend on the
same variables. This can be done by including the following
additional ratios in the functions fC and fB of each description:
NB UB ΔtB nB

NC UC ΔtC nC

For example, in the second description, the variable t/NBT may
then be changed to t/NCT by multiplying by the first of the
above ratios. Similar changes can be made for the remaining
variables using one or more of the ratios (but, in all cases,
keeping all the ratios in both functions). Analogous to the
treatment used in establishing Eqs. L and M from Eq. J, the
ratios in the functions fC and fB are required to be fixed in value
in the scaling process. The following scaling relations for the
agent capecitabine, like Eqs. L and M, may thus be written as

Consistent with earlier requirements of Eq. K and its generalization here, the number of doses for each agents must also be
the same for the human and laboratory animal, although the
number may of course be different for the two agents. This
condition then automatically satisfies the requirement for
fixed value of the last of the above ratios.
This scaling theory may be applied to the study by
Kolinsky and colleagues (20) where, in addressing the matter
of combination therapy involving capecitabine and bevacizumab, laboratory studies were made on mice having tumors
formed from implanted cancer cells. With dosing schedule
of 2-week cycles (7-day dosing followed by 7-day rest),
capecitabine was administered (p.o.) once a day for 7 days
of each treatment week with a dose of 1,360 mg/m2 per
day, and bevacizumab was administered (i.p.) twice weekly
(1st and 4th injections) of each treatment week with a dose
of 14.6 mg/m2, or average of 4.17 mg/m2 per day. Tumor
volume at the beginning of treatment was approximately
100 mm3. At the end of the treatment week of the second
cycle, tumor volume had increased by a factor of 4 when capecitabine alone was used, whereas no increase occurred
when bevacizumab was included. In contrast, the tumor volume in mice receiving no treatment increased by a factor of
15. These results are impressive and it is of interest to determine the corresponding scaled doses and schedule for the
human.
First, it can be seen that Eq. T is essentially satisfied here,
as it was found earlier in the individual studies of capecitabine and bevacizumab that UC and UB could be considered
independent of body mass and NC and NB could be considered to vary with body mass to the powers −0.08 and −0.06,
respectively, that is, with body mass to the value of about
−0.07. Next, the scaled values of the dose and interval of capecitabine for the human (MH = 70 kg) may be determined
from Eqs. P and Q and the above values for the mouse (MM =
0.025 kg) as 4,130 mg/m2 per day for intervals of 4.17 days.
The dose per interval is the product of these two values and
is 17,200 mg/m2. With 7 intervals, the total period of dosing
for the human is also found to be 29.2 days. For bevacizumab, Eqs. R Eqs. S Eqs. T provide corresponding values for
the human of 12.7 mg/m 2 per day over 29.2 days, with

Scaling Laws for Tolerable Doses of Anticancer Drugs

Discussion
The concept of using body surface area for scaling critical
doses of anticancer drugs from laboratory animals to humans and among humans of different sizes has been in place
now for some 50 years. Limitations on its applicability have,
however, not yet been identified in a systematic manner. The
present work has been concerned with this subject within
the larger context of developing scaling laws for single and
periodic dosing. Scaling laws for projecting critical doses of
anticancer drugs from laboratory animals to humans and
among humans of different sizes have been considered in
terms of the requirement of similarity of the concentrationtime history of a particular agent. These indicate appropriate
dosage scaling on the basis of body surface area provided adjustments are made for complex drug behavior involving
plasma protein binding and cycles of blood circulation
needed for adequate capillary exchange. In the case of single
dosing, a further adjustment for body mass is needed for
scaling dose itself, and for periodic dosing rate, an accompanying scaling restriction on drug schedule is required. In this
case, dose per interval (or per injection) is determined by the
product of dose rate (mg/m2 per day) and dosing interval
(time between doses). Application and extension of these
scaling laws have already been discussed here in some detail.
It is, however, worthwhile to consider briefly some further
matters regarding the particular case of dosing of humans,
where reference is to a standard human and associated standard dose.
Dosing of adult humans
Some simplification of the above general relations may be
considered for scaling between adult humans because of the
limited range of body sizes that are involved. In particular,
the effects of complex drug behavior, mentioned above,
may likely be neglected so that Eq. L can be reduced to the
general requirement of dosage scaling on the basis of body
surface area. Also, because the range of body masses is rela-

tively small, no significant adjustment is likely to be required
by Eq. M for drug schedule, so that the entire scaling procedure here is like that of standard clinical practice.
Pediatric dosing
Based on the present work, it can be anticipated that scaling of both drug dose and schedule will generally be important in pediatric dosing. For example, for the case of a
standard human with a body mass of 60 kg and a drug similar, say, to zebularine, but with a standard dose of 20 mg/m2
per day for 5 days, the dose per day for a small child with a
body mass of 10 kg is 16.7 mg/m2 per day, and the interval
between injections is 0.70 day. The dose per interval (and injection) is therefore 11.7 mg/m2, and this is to be given every
0.70 day for 5 injections, with a total dose of 58.5 mg/m2.
This dose may be compared with the more intense dosing
based solely on body surface area, which requires a daily
dose of 20 mg/m2 per day for 5 days, with a total dose of
100 mg/m2. Thus, dosing on the basis of body surface area
alone is predicted here to result in significant overdose in
small children, by a factor of 1.7. This result is in general
agreement with experience, as reported by Johnson (21) for
a wide variety of drugs.
Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest
No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

Correction: Scaling Laws for Plasma
Concentrations and Tolerable Doses of
Anticancer Drugs
In this article (Cancer Res 2010;70:4801–8), which was published in the June 15, 2010,
issue of Cancer Research (1), there is an error in presentation of values for the ratio
UH/UM in the illustrative example involving nimustine hydrochloride. Approximate

Figure 1. (revised). Normalized total concentration values of mouse and dog as
scaled to human and compared with direct measurements from the human.

values for this ratio for mouse and dog (as used for Fig. 1) should have been stated as
0.63 and 0.40, respectively. In addition, the vertical axes of Figs. 1, 3, 4, and 5 should
have indicated normalized total concentrations C(tot)/D. All equations in the article
refer to free (unbound) drug concentrations C(fre), whereas data in the ﬁgures
involve total concentrations C(tot). Unfortunately, this fact was masked in the
article by use of the identical symbol C (without qualiﬁcation) for both.
With regard to Fig. 1, recent analysis has also indicated improved values of UH/UM
for mouse and dog of 0.79 and 0.63, respectively, and an improved value of the
exponent b in the relation NH/NM ¼ (MH/MM)b of 0.09. Details concerning
application of the theory are also worthy of mention: Total concentrations must
ﬁrst be converted to free concentrations (with free-concentration fractions fu)
before the theory can be used. The equations in the article can then be applied to
scale the resulting data for mouse and dog to the human, with this operation
followed by reversion of the scaled results to total concentrations by division by fu
for the human. Results (using the above improved values) are shown above in the
revised Fig. 1. Fractions fu for mouse, dog, and human are 0.56, 0.89, and 0.35,
respectively (from ref. 9 of article).
With respect to results shown in Figs. 3–5, initial calculations indicated the ratio
UH/UM ¼ 1 for the various cases considered. For this condition, the equations in the
article can be applied directly for both free and total concentrations (2). This was, in
fact, done in obtaining the results shown in the original ﬁgures. No changes to these
results are required, although corrections should be made to the wordings of the
vertical axes and ﬁgure captions analogous to those indicated above in the
revised Fig. 1.
