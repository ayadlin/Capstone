ABSTRACT
Sodium potassium pump (Na+/K+ ATPase) is a validated pharmacological target
for the treatment of various cardiac conditions. Recent published data with Na+/K+
ATPase inhibitors suggest a potent anti-cancer action of these agents in multiple
indications. In the present study, we focus on istaroxime, a Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor
that has shown favorable safety and efficacy properties in cardiac phase II clinical
trials. Our experiments in 22 cancer cell lines and in prostate tumors in vivo proved
the strong anti-cancer action of this compound. Istaroxime induced apoptosis,
affected the key proliferative and apoptotic mediators c-Myc and caspase-3 and
modified actin cystoskeleton dynamics and RhoA activity in prostate cancer cells.
Interestingly, istaroxime was capable of binding to mAR, a membrane receptor
mediating rapid, non-genomic actions of steroids in prostate and other cells. These
results support a multi-level action of Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors in cancer cells and
collectively validate istaroxime as a strong re-purposing candidate for further cancer
drug development.

INTRODUCTION

reported [3–7]. Istaroxime represents the lead candidate
from this class and has successfully concluded phase II
clinical trials in cardiac failure patients [8–10]. Na+/K+
ATPase is also emerging as a novel anti-cancer target.
Overall, four layers of evidence support this role (reviewed
in [11]). First, aberrant expression of enzyme subunits has
been observed in a growing number of cancers. Second,
several different CTS have shown outstanding activities

Na+/K+ ATPase is a well-established pharmaco­
logical target acting as a receptor for cardiotonic steroids
(CTS) such as digoxin and digitoxin [1, 2]. Most recently,
a new generation of non-sugar containing steroidal
enzyme inhibitors with improved therapeutic indices (i.e.
better ratio of therapeutic activity versus toxicity) has been

prostate cancer xenografts

in chemical and functional screens. Third, data from
multiple epidemiological studies involving CTS-treated
cardiac patients have shown reduced cancer development
risk, incidence or mortality in certain cancer indications.
Finally, clinical trials with various CTS have proven the
promising anti-cancer potential of these inhibitors.
Based on the promising anti-cancer properties
described above, our group previously assessed the anticancer potential of novel Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors [3–7],
showing strong activity of these compounds in multiple
cancer cell lines [12, 13]. Moreover, 3-R-POD, the most
active derivative of this series, exhibited dose dependent
tumor inhibition in prostate and lung cancer xenografts
in vivo [12, 13]. In the current study, we focused on
istaroxime, the lead inhibitor of this class. Specifically, we
show that istaroxime is active in 22 different cancer cell
lines derived from 9 tumor panels in vitro as well as in
prostate cancer xenografts in vivo. We demonstrate novel
mechanistic insights on the signaling of this compound
in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we link for the first
time Na+/K+ ATPase and mAR, a membrane androgen
receptor mediating rapid, non-genomic anti-cancer effects
of androgens in multiple cancer cells [14, 15]. Our results
provide novel insights into the anti-cancer properties of
istaroxime further supporting development of this agent
as a novel anti-cancer drug candidate.

To further characterize the anti-cancer properties
of istaroxime, we have performed experiments in PC-3
prostate xenografts in vivo. Initially, we determined the
compound’s maximum tolerated dose (MTD) by injecting
increasing doses in NOD/SCID mice via intraperitoneal
(IP) injection. These studies defined the acute MTD (single
dose) at 200 mg/kg. Daily administration of 40–50 mg/kg
over a period of several days (chronic administration) was
also well tolerated (data not shown). Taken together this
dosing information and the short half-life of the compound
(< 1 hour; [18]), we have selected a dose of 22.5 mg/kg
administered IP twice daily (at 12 hours intervals) for
prostate xenograft experiments. Docetaxel, an anticancer drug approved for metastatic prostate cancer was
also included as a positive control in our assays (dosed
intravenously at 12 mg/kg, once weekly). As shown in
Figure  1B, istaroxime showed statistically significant
tumor growth inhibition against PC-3 xenografts (p < 0.05,
days 7, 10, 17 and 24). DT/DC values ranged between
41–67% throughout the experiment (Figure 1; Panel C),
whereas Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI) at day 24 was
43.1%. Neither istaroxime nor docetaxel significantly
modified body weight as indicator of toxicity (Figure 1;
Panel D). Similar results were obtained in a separate
xenograft experiment employing a dose of 40 mg/kg
injected IP once daily (four daily treatments followed
by three days of rest for three weeks; data not shown).
Altogether, these results confirm the anti-cancer activity of
istaroxime in prostate cancer xenografts in vivo.

RESULTS
In vitro anti-cancer activity of istaroxime in
multiple cell lines
Having recently characterized 17 cardiac enzyme
inhibitors in anti-cancer assays [12, 13], we tested the
anti-cancer activity of istaroxime, the prototype cardiac
inhibitor of this class (Figure 1A, Na+/K+ ATPase IC50:
407.5  nM). Specifically, we determined GI50, TGI and
LC50 values (see SRB assays, Methods) of the compound
in 22 different cancer cell lines from 9 tumor panels
(lung, melanoma, ovarian, renal, CNS, breast, pancreas,
colon and prostate). Istaroxime exhibited GI50 and LC50
values in the low micromolar range in all cell lines; PC-3
and DU145 prostate cancer cells were among the most
sensitive cells to the action of the compound (Table 1).
Although some anti-proliferative activity was observed
in normal fibroblasts, TGI and LC50 values of istaroxime
were significantly higher in comparison to values in cancer
cells (Table 1). Interestingly, and as shown previously
for other inhibitors of the same class [12], istaroxime
exhibited comparable anti-cancer activity in multi-drug
resistant NCI/ADRRES cells [16, 17]. Similar results
were observed with MTT assays in DU145 and CAKI-1
cells (Table 1) further confirming istaroxime’s anti-cancer
action.

Istaroxime induces apoptosis and caspase-3
activation in prostate cancer cells
We further analyzed the apoptosis of DU145
prostate cancer cells treated with 5 μM of the compound
over a period of 24 hours. As shown by FACS analysis
(Figure 2, Panels A, B), istaroxime increased the number
of apoptotic cells from 9.48% in control samples to
46.54% following treatment (Figure 2, Panel C). In
agreement with the FACS data, istaroxime induced a
modest, yet reproducible increase in caspase-3 activity
peaking at 24 h post treatment initiation (Figure 2;
Panel D).

Istaroxime reduces c-Myc expression and
induces actin cytoskeleton re-organization and
RhoA activation in prostate cancer cells
Recent studies with other CTS have recently reported
a reduction of c-Myc oncoprotein expression and actincytoskeleton re-arrangements in prostate and lung cancer

cells [19, 20]. To assess whether istaroxime induced similar
effects, we performed c-Myc Western blot analysis in
DU145 prostate cells treated with 5 μΜ of the compound
in a time course extending up to 6 hours. In agreement
with previous observations, istaroxime significantly
down-regulated c-Myc protein levels (Figure 3). c-Myc
mRNA levels remained unchanged at the same time (data
not shown), indicating that istaroxime-mediated effects
most likely occurred through protein destabilization.
Interestingly, the compound modulated actin polymerization
dynamics by inducing rapid -within 30 minutes- F/G-actin
ratio increase; actin polymerization persisted for at least
120 minutes (Figure 4A). This finding was supported by
laser scanning microscopy analysis (Figure 4B), showing a
reorganization of the actin network with formation of stress
fibers (Figure 4B arrows) in treated cells.
The Rho family of small GTPases holds a prominent
role in regulating rapid actin reorganization induced
by various effectors [21–23]. Thus, we performed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

affinity precipitation assays with a GST-fusion protein
comprising the rhotekin Rho-binding domain (GSTRBD) to assess RhoA GTP loading [24]. As shown in
Figure 4C, treatment with a positive control (PC; 10−7 M
testosterone-HSA conjugate) induced a rapid and moderate
1.5 fold activation of RhoA as reported previously [14,
25]. Interestingly, istaroxime was also able to induce
early and robust RhoA activation (3.2 fold); this result
was in agreement with its capacity to induce rapid actin
polymerization and the reported role of RhoA in this
process [23, 26].

Istaroxime precludes binding of testosterone
conjugates to the membrane androgen receptor

istaroxime in actin cytoskeleton re-organization and rapid

receptor (mAR) (e.g. Testosterone-Human Serum Albumin
conjugates; Testo-HSA conjugates, TAC), [14, 15] and ii)
istaroxime contains the typical steroid A-D ring structure
similar to testosterone-HSA conjugates (Figure  1A),
we tested the capacity of this compound to preclude
binding of a fluorescent Testosterone-HSA conjugate
(TAC-FITC) to mAR in fluorescent-based assays as
described previously [27]. For these assays, we used
LNCaP prostate cancer cells due to their optimal mAR
detection properties and similarities in growth responses
to istaroxime in comparison to DU145 or PC-3 cells (data
not shown). In agreement with published results [27],
TAC-FITC conjugates showed clear membrane staining,
(Figure 5, Panel B) while cells stained with empty
HSA-conjugates (HSA-FITC) exhibited no membrane
staining (Figure 5, Panel A). Pre-incubation of cells with
istaroxime resulted in loss of membrane fluorescence
indicating that istaroxime precludes binding of TAC-FITC
to the membrane androgen receptor (Figure 5, Panel C).
Similar results were obtained with another Na+/K+ ATPase
inhibitor, digoxin (Figure 5, Panel D).

In this study, we focused on istaroxime, a Na+/K+
ATPase inhibitor designed to overcome known proarrhythmic and other limitations of CTS [6, 18]. Having
shown favorable properties in cardiac phase II clinical
trials [8–10], istaroxime seemed an ideal cancer repurposing candidate. Our growth assays in multiple cell
lines (Table 1) together with efficacy experiments in PC-3
prostate cancer xenografts in vivo (Figure 1) confirmed the
purported anti-cancer effects of this compound. Analyzing
istaroxime’s mechanism of action, we have shown that
the compound induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation
in prostate cancer cells (Figure 2). Similar to what was
shown for other Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors, istaroxime
suppressed c-Myc oncoprotein expression (Figure 3) and
induced actin cytoskeleton re-organization in prostate
cancer cells (Figure 4). Finally, in agreement with its actin
re-modeling role, istaroxime treatment resulted in rapid
activation of RhoA signaling (Figure 4C). We believe
that the activation of RhoA induced by istaroxime is an
early and transient stimulus of actin polymerization, rather
than associated with enhanced invasiveness of the cells
[37]. In line with this, a wound healing assay showed
clear inhibition of cell migration in DU145 cells treated
by istaroxime as compared to untreated cells (data not
shown). Further studies are now needed to address this
issue in more detail.
Searching for additional targets and/or downstream
effectors of istaroxime, we have also tested the potential
functional crosstalk of Na+/K+ ATPase with mAR, a
membrane receptor mediating rapid, non-genomic anticancer effects of androgens [14, 15]. Our hypothesis was
triggered by the observation that mAR activation shared
several similarities to Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition, namely
induction of rapid actin cytoskeleton reorganization
and rapid RhoA activation (Figure 4; [15]). Using both
fluorescent binding exclusion (Figure 5) and displacement
assays (Figure 6), we have shown binding of istaroxime
to the mAR. This indicated functional crosstalk of this
receptor with the Na+/K+ ATPase.
These results initially supported the idea that the
membrane pool of Na+/K+ ATPase may actually serve as
the elusive mAR, a hypothesis also put forward more than
20 years ago by Farnsworth [38]. However, several lines of
evidence argue against this hypothesis. First, we have been
unable to show direct inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase activity
by testosterone, DHT, testosterone-albumin conjugates
or testosterone 3-CMO (a selective mAR ligand [39]) in
assays using purified Na+/K+ ATPase (data not shown).
Similarly, assays in Xenopus laevis oocytes failed to show
any influence of testosterone on Na+/K+ ATPase currents
(data not shown). Third, neither istaroxime nor digoxin
or ouabain were capable of blocking mAR dependent
apoptosis triggered by testosterone-albumin conjugates in
prostate cancer cells and vice versa (data not shown). These
results together with observations that mAR is a G-protein
coupled receptor (reviewed in [40]) further support the

Istaroxime displaces radioactive testosterone
bound to the membrane androgen receptor
To further characterize the putative interaction of
istaroxime with mAR, we performed binding experiments
using radiolabeled testosterone in membrane preparations of
DU145 cells. As shown in Figure 6, membrane preparations
incubated with [3H]-testosterone in the presence of
increasing concentrations of Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
(10–12 to 10–5 M) revealed a displacement of radiolabeled
testosterone by DHT. In agreement with fluorescent assay
results, istaroxime displaced radiolabeled testosterone and
was more potent than DHT in this assay. Displacement of
radiolabeled testosterone seemed to be more pronounced
when both DHT and istaroxime were combined. However,
differences between groups were not statistically significant.
These results indicated direct binding of istaroxime to the
mAR. Of note, similar results were obtained with digoxin
(data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Recent preclinical and clinical data point to a
potential anti-cancer effect of Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition
in various indications [28]. For example, several cancer
types harboring isoform overexpression or holoenzyme
subunit alterations have been identified (reviewed in [11];
references herein). In addition, a series of screening and
epidemiological studies qualify CTS as highly active anticancer compounds with the potential to reduce cancer
risk [29–33]. In agreement with these observations,
plant derived inhibitors such as PBI-05204/oleandrin or
HuaChanShu have shown anti-cancer activity in early
clinical trials [34–36].

notion that Na+/K+ ATPase and mAR may not be identical.
Indeed, the finding that istaroxime together with DHT was
more effective than each agent alone in displacement assays
performed with membranes of DU145 cells (Figure 6),
support the notion that Na+/K+ ATPase and mAR may either
share a common subunit, be part of a bigger membrane
complex or be functionally interlinked. For example,
it is possible that istaroxime binds to a Na+/K+ ATPase
accessory factor increasing its affinity to mAR or a relevant
complex. This may result in mAR activation (explaining the
results on rapid RhoA activation and actin re-organization,
Figure 4). Alternatively, membrane calcium channels could
be formed on the membrane linking Na+/K+ ATPase and
mAR [41]. This could explain the observations that both,
Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition and mAR activation result in an
increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels [42–44].

The pore forming Ca2+ release activated Ca2+
channel (CRAC) subunit Orai, shown to participate in
both mAR signaling and regulation of Na+/K+ ATPase
expression in various tumors [45–48] may play as well
a role. The same applies for Na+/H+ exchanger and
glucocorticoid inducible kinase-1 (SGK1), both shown to
be functionally interlinked with mAR and Na+/K+ ATPase
[49–52]. Additional candidates include GPRC6A, a Ca2+
activated G-protein coupled receptor proposed to be
identical to mAR [53, 54] or the zinc transporter ZIP9
also proposed to fulfill the role of mAR in cancer cells
[55]. Finally, it is worth noting that potential involvement
of the intracellular androgen receptor (iAR) to Na+/K+
ATPase is highly unlikely at this point since i) iAR is
functionally discrete to mAR as shown by multiple
publications (reviewed by [15]) and ii) istaroxime does

not bind the iAR [6]. On the other hand, published
observations that progesterone may directly bind the
Na+/K+ ATPase complex clearly point to the necessity of
performing a more detailed functional characterization of
the interplay of Na+/K+ ATPase with mAR, iAR or other
steroid receptors.

In conclusion, istaroxime, a clinically validated
cardiac Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor, exhibits strong anticancer potential in vitro and in in vivo. Our results
and reported mechanisms of action support a drug
re-purposing potential of the compound against prostate
and other tumors.

response parameters were calculated for each agent.
Growth inhibition of 50% (GI50): drug concentration
resulting in a 50% reduction of growth; Total growth
inhibition (TGI): drug concentration resulting in a
100% reduction of growth and lethal concentration of
50% (LC50): concentration of drug resulting in a 50%
reduction of cell viability. Typically, all assays were
done in triplicates in 2–3 repetitions for each compound.
This is deemed sufficient to extrapolate on the activity of
each compound. Note that MTT-calculated IC50 values
may differ from SRB-assay calculated GI50 values due to
inherent differences in assay methodologies.

Compounds
Istaroxime was synthesized as described previously
[6] with modifications (see Supplementary Methods).
DHT, HSA-FITC, Testosterone-HSA, Testosterone-HSAFITC conjugates, Testosterone-3-CMO, ouabain and
digoxin were obtained by Sigma (Germany).

Ethical statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors’
institutional review board.

Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) assays
Female NOD/scid mice, 8 weeks old, weighing
~21 g were used for the MTD studies according to NCI
guidelines (https://dtp.cancer.gov/organization/btb/acute_
toxicity.htm). Briefly, one animal per individual dose was
injected with a single dose of 200/100/50/25/12.5 mg/kg
of instaroxime respectively, in a volume of 20  μL/g of
weight. Animals were weighed prior to each administration
and volumes/dose administered was adjusted according
to body weights. The animal that received 200 mg/kg
suffered from sedation but recovered within 1–2 hours; all
other animals showed no side effects. In a second round of
experiments, animals received once-daily doses of 40 and
50 mg/kg for several consecutive days; these treatments
were also well tolerated. Based on these studies, we
concluded that the compound’s acute MTD was 200 mg/kg
whereas the chronic MTD was > 50 mg/kg.

Cell lines
With the exception of CCSWD1 cells (generated
from a human clear cell sarcoma/malignant melanoma
tumor [56]), and normal human fibroblast cells (Lonza,
USA), all cancer lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) or the National
Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH (Bethesda, MD, USA). These
cell lines are categorized as follows: lung: A549, EKVX,
H460; melanoma: SK-MEL28, LOXIMVIb, MDAMB-435; breast: MCF7, T47D; ovarian: OVCAR-5,
OVCAR-3, IGROV1, NCI-ADRES; prostate: PC-3,
DU145, LNCaP; pancreas: SU8686; renal: CAKI-1;
Central Nervous System: SF-295, U251, SF-268; colon:
HCT-116, HCT15. Cell lines were adapted to grow in
RPMI1640 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM
L-Glutamine, 5–10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics
in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37°C.

PC-3 xenograft studies
Xenografts were generated by subcutaneously
injecting exponentially growing cultures of ~2 × 106
PC-3 cells (in Matrigel in 0.1 ml PBS) at the right flank
of 6–8 weeks old male Balb/c nude mice. Following
development of palpable tumors (150–200 mm3) and
group randomization (10 animals per group), the following
treatments were administered:
Group A: Water for Injection (WFI), IP, twice daily
for 23 days at 12 hours intervals.
Group B: Istaroxime at 22.5 mg/kg, IP, twice daily
for 23 days at 12 hours intervals.
Group C: Docetaxel at 12 mg/kg, IV, once weekly
for 23 days.
Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly in
two dimensions using a caliper according to the formula
V = 1/2 × a × b2 where a and b are the long and short
diameters of the tumor respectively. %DT/DC values were
also calculated, where DT = T − Do and DC = C − Do
(Do is the average tumor volume at the beginning of
the treatment; T and C are the volumes of treated and
untreated tumors, respectively, at a specified day). Tumor
Growth Inhibition was calculated as the percentage of

Na+/K+ ATPase assays
Istaroxime’s inhibitory effect on ATPase activity was
assessed in vitro using the Adenosine 5´-Triphosphatase
Enzymatic Assay of Sigma (St.Louis, MO) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions as reported previously
[12]. This assay utilizes enzyme isolated from porcine
cerebral cortex.

MTT and SRB assays
Cell proliferation/viability was assessed by MTT
[3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] assays (Sigma, St.Louis, MO) done as
previously described [12]. Sulforhodamine B (SRB)
assays were performed according to NCI guidelines
for anti-cancer drug screening (https://dtp.cancer.gov/

Losses of weight, neurological disorders, behavioral
and dietary changes were also recorded as indicators
of toxicity (side effects). Experiments were terminated
when tumors in control animals reached a volume of
~2000–2500 mm3 (about 11% of the body weight).

the chromophor p-nitroaniline) for 2 h at 37oC. The
absorbance of each sample was measured at 405 nm by
using a 96-well colorimetric plate reader.

Immunoblotting
Cells were incubated with 5 μM istaroxime for the
indicated time periods, washed twice with ice cold PBS
and suspended in 500 μl ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/
HCl, 1% TritonX-100 pH 7.4, 1% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, 0.15% NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate) containing protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma). The protein concentration was determined using
the Bradford assay (BioRad). Sixty µg of protein were
solubilized in sample buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE
and transferred on PVDF membranes. The membranes
were initially analyzed with anti c-Myc antibody (1:100,
9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and subsequently,
after stripping, with anti-beta Actin (1:100, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA). Appropriate horseradish peroxidase
conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000, Cell Signaling,
USA) and the ECL detection reagent (Amersham,
Germany) were used. Blots were quantified using Quantity
One Software (Biorad, Germany).

Ethical conduct of animal experiments
MTD experiments were performed at the Pharmacy
Department, University of Athens, Greece under the
approval of the veterinary committee (Approval number
Κ/2844) and in agreement with Greek laws (2015/92),
EU & European council guidelines (86/609 and ETS123,
respectively), and Compliance with Standards for
Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NIH, USA
(Assurance No. A5736–01).
Animals used in xenograft studies were treated
according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources,
National Academy Press, Washington, 1996. Specific
conditions regarding handling of moribund animals
as determined by the veterinary staff of the test facility
were explicitly defined in the study protocol according to
international guidelines including euthanasia for humane
reasons. This included carbon dioxide inhalation followed
by exsanguination. Final disposition of all animals placed
on study was documented in all study records.

Measurement of F/G actin ratio by Triton X-100
fractionation
The Triton X-100 soluble G-actin and Triton X-100
insoluble F-actin containing fractions of cells exposed
to 5 μM istaroxime for the time periods indicated in
Figure legend, were prepared as previously described [58].
An increase of the triton-insoluble (F-) to the triton-soluble
(G-) actin ratio is indicative of actin polymerization.

TUNEL apoptosis assay and FACS analysis
DU145 cells were cultured in serum containing
medium in the absence or presence of 5 μM istaroxime for
24 hours. At the end of the treatment, cells were harvested
in PBS and apoptosis was assessed using the APO-BrdU™
TUNEL Assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The APOBrdU™ TUNEL Assay kit labelled DNA strand breaks for
the detection of apoptotic cells through addition of BrdU
at the 3´-hydroxyl ends by terminal deoxynucleotide
transferase. Final detection of BrdU incorporation at DNA
break sites was detected using an Alexa Fluor488–labeled
anti-BrdU antibody. Propidium Iodide was used to stain
the total cell population. Flow cytometry was performed
with FACSArray apparatus (BD Biosciences) and the
results were analyzed by the CellQuest software (BD
Biosciences).

Confocal laser scanning microscopy
Cells were cultured on glass coverslips with
5 μM istaroxime for the time points indicated in the
Figure  legend. For direct fluorescence microscopy of
F-actin, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in
PBS for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100
in PBS (10 min) and incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, 1:100 dilution) for
40 min in the dark. Confocal microscopy was performed
with a Zeiss LSM 5 EXCITER confocal laser-scanning
module (Carl Zeiss) and images were analyzed with the
instrument’s software.

Caspase-3 assay

RhoA activity determination

The activity of caspase-3 was measured in whole
cell lysates pretreated or not with 5 μM istaroxime for
the time periods indicated in the Figure legends, using
the Clontech ApoAlert® Caspase Colorimetric Assay kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Caspase-3
activity was determined by incubating lysates with a
caspase-3 substrate (the peptide DEVD conjugated to

FACS analysis.

To determine the capacity of a given compound
to preclude binding of fluorescent testosterone-HSA
conjugates (TAC-FITC) to the mAR, starved LNCaP
cells grown on coverslips were pre-treated with 40 μΜ
of the indicated drug for 30 minutes prior to the addition
of testosterone-HSA-FITC. At the end of the incubation
period, cells were washed twice with PBS and 40 μΜ
of testosterone-HSA-FITC was added. Specimens were
prepared and analyzed as described above. Compounds
binding to the mAR preclude binding of fluorescent
testosterone-HSA conjugates to their target and abolish
membrane-specific fluorescence.

Detection of membrane androgen receptors and
competition assays
For membrane preparation DU145 cells cultured in
five 75 cm2 flasks, were washed twice with PBS, removed
by scraping, and centrifuged at 1, 500 g for 5 min. Pelleted
cells were homogenized by sonication in 50 mM Tris-HCl
buffer, pH 7.4, containing freshly added protease inhibitors
(10 μg/ml PMSF and Roche complete protease inhibitor
tablets). Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation
at 2, 500 g for 15 min. Membranes were obtained by
centrifugation at 20, 000 g for 1 h and washed once with
the same buffer. Protein concentration was measured by
the method of Bradford using reagents from Bio-Rad
(Hercules, CA). Displacement binding experiments were
performed as previously described [59]. In brief, cell
membrane preparations at a final concentration of 1.0 mg/
ml were incubated with 5 nM [3H] testosterone in the
absence or in the presence of different concentrations of
unlabeled steroid (istaroxime, DHT, istaroxime and DHT),
ranging from 10–12 to 10–5 M. Non-specific binding was
estimated in the presence of 5 μM istaroxime. In both types
of binding experiments, after an overnight incubation at
4°C, bound radioactivity was separated by filtration under
reduced pressure through GF/A filters previously soaked
in 0.5% polyethylenimine (PEI) in water and rinsed
three times with ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer. Filters were
mixed with 10 ml scintillation cocktail (03999, Fluka),
