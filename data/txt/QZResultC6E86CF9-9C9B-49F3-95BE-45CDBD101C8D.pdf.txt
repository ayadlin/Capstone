Abstract
Aromatase inhibitors (AI) have become the ﬁrst-line endocrine
treatment of choice for postmenopausal estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ) breast cancer patients, but resistance remains a major
challenge. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer
and may contribute to drug resistance. Here, we investigated
the link between altered breast cancer metabolism and
AI resistance using AI-resistant and sensitive breast cancer
cells, patient tumor samples, and AI-sensitive human xenografts. We found that long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED), a
model of AI resistance, was associated with increased glycolysis
dependency. Targeting the glycolysis-priming enzyme hexokinase-2 (HK2) in combination with the AI, letrozole, synergistically reduced cell viability in AI-sensitive models. Conversely,
MCF7-LTED cells, which displayed a high degree of metabolic
plasticity, switched to oxidative phosphorylation when glycol-

ysis was impaired. This effect was ER dependent as breast cancer
cells with undetectable levels of ER failed to exhibit metabolic
plasticity. MCF7-LTED cells were also more motile than their
parental counterparts and assumed amoeboid-like invasive
abilities upon glycolysis inhibition with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). Mechanistic investigations further revealed an important
role for miR-155 in metabolic reprogramming. Suppression of
miR-155 resulted in sensitization of MCF7-LTED cells to metformin treatment and impairment of 2-DG–induced motility.
Notably, high baseline miR-155 expression correlated with poor
response to AI therapy in a cohort of ERþ breast cancers treated
with neoadjuvant anastrozole. These ﬁndings suggest that miR155 represents a biomarker potentially capable of identifying
the subset of breast cancers most likely to adapt to and relapse
on AI therapy. Cancer Res; 76(6); 1615–26. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

(ICI182,780), which induces ER degradation (1). In postmenopausal patients, AIs have become the ﬁrst-line treatment choice,
showing higher efﬁcacy than tamoxifen therapy (2). However,
resistance remains a problem. Several molecular mechanisms
have been proposed to contribute to AI resistance including
hypersensitization to estrogen (3, 4) and activation via aberrant
growth factor signaling (5). These ﬁndings have been exploited
clinically by combination therapy approaches in which AIs have
been effectively combined either with HER2-targeting compounds (6, 7) or with inhibitors targeting downstream signaling
effectors such as mTORC1 (8). However, given the adaptability of
tumor cells, targeting a single growth factor or a downstream
signaling hub will likely lead to compensatory upregulation.
Indeed, many patients fail to beneﬁt from these combined therapeutic approaches and there remains an urgent need for more
efﬁcient therapeutic strategies. It has been shown that targeting
bioenergetic alterations sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapy (9–11) and to biologic therapy, such as Herceptin (12).
However, it is unclear whether cancer cell metabolic reprogramming may contribute to AI resistance and whether targeting it may
sensitize cancer cells to AIs.
Most cancer cells, even in the presence of oxygen, show
increased glycolysis followed by fermentation of pyruvate to
lactate (Warburg effect) using only a small fraction of glucose
for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Clinically, highly

A majority of breast tumors at primary diagnosis express
estrogen receptor-a (ERa, called hereafter ER) and rely on ER
signaling for growth and survival. Several endocrine therapies
have been developed clinically to target the ER pathway, including
aromatase inhibitors (AI), which block the conversion of androgens to estrogens; selective ER modulators such as tamoxifen,
which compete with estrogen for ER; and fulvestrant

glycolytic tumors can be detected using labeled glucose for PET
imaging. These tumors show worse outcome (13), underscoring the therapeutic potential of inhibiting glycolysis. Several
glycolytic inhibitors have been shown to hinder tumor growth,
particularly in preclinical models, and are currently under
clinical investigation. However, no deﬁnitive answers are available for glycolysis inhibitors used as single agents, possibly due
to tumor adaptation to monotherapy (www.clinicaltrial.gov,
ID: NCT00633087; ref. 14).
In this study, we have characterized the metabolic reprogramming that ERþ breast cancers undergo in response and adaptation
to long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED). Crucially, we have
identiﬁed the miR-155/hexokinase-2 (HK2) axis as an important
regulator of tumor plasticity and demonstrate that it may have
predictive utility in response and adaptation to AI for breast cancer
patients.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Wild-type (wt) MCF-7 and ZR75-1 were obtained from ATCC
and independently validated by STR proﬁling by DNA Diagnostic Centre (DCC). Cells were ampliﬁed, stocked, and once
thawed were kept in culture for a maximum of 4 months. Cells
were maintained in phenol red–free RPMI1640 supplemented
with 10% FBS (Euroclone), 2 mmol/L glutamine, and 1 nmol/L
17-b estradiol (E2, Sigma). Long-term E2-deprived (LTED)
MCF-7 and ZR75-1 were cultured in steroid-depleted medium
in phenol red–free RPMI1640 medium containing 10% dextran
charcoal-stripped (DCC) FBS (Hyclone) and 2 mmol/L glutamine (DCC medium). MCF7 cells expressing full-length
human aromatase, known as MCF7-2A and MCF7-AROM1,
were generated and maintained as described previously
(15, 16). For functional assay, cells were cultured for three
days in DCC medium.
2-Deoxyglucose and metformin were from Sigma and 3-bromopyruvic acid from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ICI182,780 was
from Tocris Bioscience and the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
inhibitor, ilomastat, was from Chemicon International. All of the
antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, except for HKII
(Cell Signaling Technology), anti-RAC1 (BD transduction laboratories) and GLUT1 (Abcam).
Cell viability
Cell survival fraction was conducted as reported previously
(17).
Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses were conducted as described previously
(15). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and 20–50 mg of total
proteins were loaded on precast SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad).
In vitro Boyden motility and invasion assay
Motility and invasion assays were conducted as described
previously (18).
RhoA or Rac1 activity assay
RhoA or Rac1 activity assay was conducted as described previously (19).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and miRNA analysis
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA
synthesis performed using Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems). For miRNA analysis, miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and
miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen) were used. qRT-PCR was conducted as
described previously (15, 18, 19) using both Power SYBR green
dye (Applied Biosystems) or TaqMan assays for HK2
(Hs0060686_m1). Data were normalized on b-2 microglobulin
for SYBR or GAPDH (Hs02758991_g1) and ACTB (4310881E),
for TaqMan. For miRNA analysis on cell lines, miScript Primer
Assay Hs_miR_143_1 and Hs_miR_155_2 were used and normalized on Hs_SNORD61_1 (Qiagen). For miR-155 analysis on
patient-derived RNA, we used a DCt technique normalizing on
both SNORD61 and RNU6-2.
RNAi transfection
Cells were transfected with 20 nmol/L anti-miR-155 (Ambion)
or negative controls (Ambion, AM17011) using Lipofectamine
2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) and analyses were performed 3 days
after transfection.
Radioactive assays
Breast cancer cells were treated as described in the Figures
for 3 days and subjected to radioactive assays as described
previously (18).
In vivo experiments
Female Ncr Foxhead nude 6- to 8- week-old mice (Harlan)
were kept under sterile conditions with free access to food and
water. Mice were ovariectomized and then allowed to acclimatize for approximately 14 days. MCF7-AROM1 xenografts were
initiated by subcutaneous inoculation of 100 mL cell suspension containing 1  107 cells in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) into
the right ﬂank. Growth was maintained by androstenedione
support through intradermal daily injection (100 mg/day).
Tumors were grown to approximately 8-mm diameter and
assigned to treatment groups. Mice continued to receive androstenedione support and were randomized to receive daily doses
of vehicle (10% N-methyl-pyrollidone (NMP)/90% polyethylene glycol (PEG300) or letrozole (1 mg/kg in 150 mL of 10%
NMP/90% PEG300). Letrozole was administered daily and
mice were sacriﬁced after 21 days. All animal work was carried
out with UK Home Ofﬁce approval.
Immunostaining
For GLUT1 IHC, antigen retrieval was carried out by microwave for 5 minutes at full power (900 W) in citrate buffer pH
6.0. Anti-GLUT1 antibody was applied at 1/3,000 dilution. The
stained slides were then scanned on a whole slide scanner
(Nanozoomer 2.0-HT, Hamamatsu).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism
Software as reported in the ﬁgure legends and Results.

miR-155 Drives Metabolic Reprogramming of AI-Resistant Cells

in response to letrozole in the presence of a standard concentration of androstenedione (Fig. 1A; refs. 15, 20). Of note, 3day letrozole treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in
glycolysis capacity, indicated by reduced radioactive [3H] glucose uptake (Fig. 1B). However, at this time point, no significant cell growth inhibition was observed. These results suggest
that the inhibition of glycolysis by letrozole precedes cell
growth inhibition, indicating that glycolysis impairment is not
merely a bystander effect of the cell growth inhibition. In fact,
the inhibition of glycolysis (glucose uptake) positively correlates with the inhibition of cell viability induced by letrozole
(r ¼ 0.92, P < 0.001; Fig. 1C), suggesting that combining
letrozole with a glycolysis inhibitor may be more efﬁcient than
using AI alone. Indeed, the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose
(2-DG) signiﬁcantly enhanced the effect of letrozole in inhibiting MCF7-2A cell survival, but had no effect on parental MCF7
cells, which have no endogenous aromatase expression
(Fig. 1D). Of note, combination index (CI) analysis for 2-DG
showed that the effect was synergistic (Supplementary
Table S1). Comparable results were obtained when letrozole
was combined with the glycolytic inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

Aerobic glycolysis is enhanced in an in vitro model of AI
resistance
MCF7-LTED provides a widely accepted model of breast cancer
cells that have developed resistance to AI treatment (3). To
investigate the central carbon metabolism in the context of AI
resistance, we assessed key molecular components of the glycolytic pathway by Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR. Compared
with parental MCF7 cells, independent of estrogen (E2) stimulation, MCF7-LTED cells showed higher expression at both mRNA
and protein level of HK2, an enzyme that catalyzes the priming
step of glycolysis (Fig. 2A and B). Importantly, MCF7-LTED cells
showed increased expression of the glucose importer GLUT1
(also known as SLC2A1) (Fig. 2C) and of the lactate exporter
monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4, also known as SLC16A4;
Fig. 2A). This increase in glycolysis-associated components
reﬂected enhanced glucose uptake (Fig. 2D) and was accompanied by reduced glucose respiration, assessed by [14C] CO2 release
(Fig. 2E). Conversely, MCF7-LTED cells did not differ from
parental MCF7 cells in lactate consumption, revealed by analyses
of lactate upload (Fig. 2F) and MCT1 (also known as SLC16A1)
expression (not shown), but reduced the amount of lactate
respired (Fig. 2G), a general indication of OXPHOS impairment

in culture conditions. No signiﬁcant differences were observed in
basal metabolic activity when cells were cultured in human normoglycemic 5 mmol/L glucose compared with 11.1 mmol/L
glucose, which is the routinely used RPMI culture medium (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Metabolic targeting does not affect MCF7-LTED cell growth
revealing their metabolic plasticity
To investigate whether targeting MCF7-LTED glycolysis dependency could lead to decreased cell survival, parental MCF7
and their LTED derivatives were exposed to the metabolic poisons:
2-DG, which inhibits glycolysis, and metformin, which targets
complex 1 of the electron transport chain, leading to inhibition of
OXPHOS. Single drug treatment signiﬁcantly impaired parental
MCF7 cell survival, both in presence and absence of E2 (Fig. 3A).
Conversely, no effects were observed, either on cell survival (Fig.
3A) or apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3A), when MCF7-LTED
cells were treated with metformin, and only minor survival
fraction changes were noted when MCF7-LTED cells were treated
with 2-DG (Fig. 3A, black bars). As expected, 2-DG plus metfor-

1618 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

min dramatically impaired cell survival of both parental MCF7
and LTED cells, suggesting that the MCF7-LTED cells were capable
of switching from glycolysis to OXPHOS metabolism when
glycolysis was impaired. Indeed in MCF7-LTED cells, 2-DG treatment decreases HK2 expression (Fig. 3B) and glucose uptake
(Fig. 3C) while inducing their ability to upload lactate
(Fig. 3D), which can be diverted to OXPHOS metabolism.
Compared with MCF7 cells, ZR75-1 cells have similar ER
expression. However, in contrast to MCF7-LTED cells, ZR75-1LTED cells have undetectable levels of ER (15). 2-DG and
metformin administration reduced the survival fraction of both
parental and ZR75-1-LTED cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Crucially, combining metformin with 2-DG had an additive
effect. This suggests that ER expression is a prerequisite for the
metabolic plasticity observed in MCF7-LTED cells. This prerequisite was further reinforced by administration of the ER downregulator ICI182,780. Importantly, parental MCF7 cells and
their derivatives (LTED and MCF7-2A) treated with ICI182,780
showed impaired glucose uptake and enhanced OXPHOS rate
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

2-DG treatment enhances amoeboid-dependent cell motility
and invasion of MCF7-LTED cells
Metabolic reprogramming and motile plasticity correlates with
enhanced aggressiveness of cancer cells (21). To characterize
whether metabolic plasticity was paralleled by motile plasticity,
MCF7-LTED cells were ﬁrst subjected to a Boyden assay, in the
presence or absence of a Matrigel barrier. MCF7-LTED cells
showed increased migration compared with parental MCF7, both
in the presence and absence of E2 (Fig. 4A and B) as well as
increased invasion (Fig. 4E). E-cadherin and vimentin protein
levels were unchanged, suggesting that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is not directly involved in the enhanced
motility (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Alternative to mesenchymal
motility, cells can also adopt amoeboid motility allowing them to
slide through the extracellular matrix (22). Amoeboid migration
is characterized by MMP exclusion, inhibition of Rac1, and
activation of RhoA (23). Accordingly, MCF7-LTED cells showed
enhanced RhoA-GTP expression levels and decreased Rac1-GTP
(Fig. 4C). In addition, treatment with the MMP inhibitor ilomastat did not reduce the invasive capacity of MCF7-LTED cells
through Matrigel (Fig. 4D). Finally, gelatin zymography of parental and MCF7-LTED cells revealed no signiﬁcant differences in
MMP activity (Supplementary Fig. S5B) and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-collagen release assays showed no increase in
collagen degradation (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
As 2-DG and metformin monotherapies had no substantial
effect on MCF7-LTED cell survival, we investigated whether these
treatments impeded their migratory capacity. Surprisingly, 2-DG
treatment enhanced MCF7-LTED cell motility (Fig. 4B) and
invasive abilities (Fig. 4E), without affecting MMP activity (Supplementary Fig. S5B) or their collagen-degrading capacity (Supplementary Fig. S5C). These features were conﬁrmed in a three-

dimensional tumor spheroid invasion assay (24). MCF7-LTED
spheroids embedded in Matrigel treated with 2-DG were more
invasive than those generated from untreated MCF7-LTED cells
and the invading cells were characterized by single cell dispersal,
resembling typical amoeboid migration (Supplementary Fig. S6;
ref. 24). Therefore, MCF7-LTED cells are characterized by amoeboid motility, in line with the absence of EMT markers expression
and MMP activity.
ER-dependent miR-155 is responsible for metabolic and motile
plasticity of MCF7-LTED cells
As targeting the glycolytic metabolism with 2-DG in the AIresistant cell model led to surprising results, we investigated the
molecular mechanism responsible for the metabolic and motile
plasticity of MCF7-LTED cells.
Deregulation of miRNA expression has been demonstrated in
many types of cancer as they act as upstream regulators of mRNA
expression of genes involved in carcinogenesis (25). In particular,
miR-155 has been shown to be overexpressed in breast cancers
(26–28) and is modulated by estrogens (29). In addition, miR155 controls miR-143 expression, a miRNA known to target
HK2 in MCF7 cells (30). Indeed, miR-143 inhibits HK2 expression via a conserved miR-143 recognition motif located in the
30 -untranslated region (30 UTR) of HK2 mRNA (31). Therefore, we
hypothesized that miR-155 and miR-143 may be deregulated in
MCF7-LTED cells and responsible for the glycolytic metabolism
increase noted in this model. qRT-PCR showed that E2 induced a
signiﬁcant increase in miR-155 expression in parental MCF7 and
that MCF7-LTED cells had higher (3-fold) miR-155 expression
when compared with their parental counterpart (Fig. 5A). This
increased miR-155 expression was paralleled by a signiﬁcant
reduction in miR-143 (Fig. 5B), consistent with the increased

cells upon androstenedione administration (Supplementary
Fig. S7A). Importantly, blocking androgen to estrogen conversion
by letrozole administration restored basal miR-155 expression
(Supplementary Fig. S7A). In addition, ER dependency was validated in both E2-treated MCF7 and MCF7-LTED cells by administration of ICI182,780 (Supplementary Fig. S7B). We therefore
hypothesized that the enhanced expression of miR-155 and HK2
in MCF7-LTED cells was related to their retention of a functional
ER. This was further supported by our observation that miR-155
and HK2 expression were not signiﬁcantly altered in ER ZR75-1LTED cells (Supplementary Fig. S7C)
We subsequently targeted miR-155 to impair metabolic and
motile properties of MCF7-LTED cells. Anti-miR-155 caused a
marked reduction of miR-155 and HK2 expression and a corresponding increase of miR-143 expression (Supplementary Fig.
S8). Anti-miR-155–transfected MCF7-LTED cells showed a small
change in cell survival when compared with anti-miR scramble
control. However, exposure of the anti-miR-155–transfected cells
to metformin led to a marked reduction in cell survival (Fig. 5C).
To demonstrate that miR-155 may also be responsible for the 2DG–induced migration of MCF7-LTED cells, we compared the
anti-miR-155 transfected to the anti-miR scramble control cells.
Notably, anti-miR-155 transfection reverted the motile ability of
MCF7-LTED cells when exposed to 2-DG (Fig. 5D).

formed tumors under androstenedione support, due to the conversion into estrogen. Tumor-bearing mice were then treated with
or without letrozole and sacriﬁced after 21 days. Letrozole-treated
tumors were signiﬁcantly smaller than those of the vehicle-treated
mice (P ¼ 0.009, Supplementary Fig. S9). To determine the effects
of letrozole treatment on the glycolytic key players, GLUT1 and
HK2, and on miR-155 levels in breast cancer xenografts, MCF7AROM1 tumors were subjected to IHC and/or protein and RNA
were extracted for Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR analyses,
respectively. Letrozole signiﬁcantly reduced the expression levels
of GLUT1, as shown by IHC (Fig. 6A) and Western blot analysis
(Fig. 6B), and that of HK2, both at protein (Fig. 6B) and at mRNA
levels (Fig. 6C), although the latter with borderline statistical
signiﬁcance. Importantly, miR-155 levels were signiﬁcantly
reduced by letrozole administration (Fig. 6D), reinforcing the in
vitro ﬁndings linking miR-155 expression and the glycolytic
phenotype.
Glycolytic key players correlate with response to AI
treatment in vivo
Next, we evaluated whether key glycolytic players, such as
GLUT1 and MCT4, which were differentially expressed in
MCF7-LTED versus parental control, correlated with response to
AI treatment. In silico analysis was performed by retrieving publicly available gene expression data from biopsies of 52 ERþ
breast cancer patients taken before and after 2 weeks of neoadjuvant letrozole treatment (32). The patients were subsequently
divided into responders and nonresponders deﬁned by a more
than 50% and less than 50% reduction, respectively, in tumor
volume, following a further 3 months of letrozole treatment.
Pairwise comparison shows a signiﬁcant decrease in GLUT1
expression after 2 weeks of letrozole treatment in the responder

Conversely, MCT4 expression increased in the nonresponder
cohort with a borderline statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 7B, P ¼
0.055), but not in the responder cohort. HK2 expression was
also analyzed and although no signiﬁcant differences were
reported by paired t test in both responder and nonresponder
patients, it was interesting to note that 57% (21/37) of the
responders showed a decreased HK2 expression, whereas 67%
(10/15) of the nonresponders showed an increased expression
after 2 weeks of treatment with letrozole.
These ﬁndings were independently validated in gene expression
data derived from 69 paired ERþ tumor biopsies taken pre- and
post- 2-week neoadjuvant treatment with the nonsteroidal AI
anastrozole (33). As previously reported, lack of response to AI
treatment can be monitored by a decrease in Ki67 staining (15), a
parameter that has been shown to predict poor long-term disease
outcome (1). Pretreatment (i.e., samples before receiving anastrozole) MCT4 expression showed a signiﬁcant inverse correlation with pretreatment Ki67 levels (Fig. 7C; r ¼ 0.28, P ¼ 0.02),
suggesting that MCT4 expression is not merely a surrogate marker
of highly proliferating tumors. Furthermore, the change in GLUT1
expression in the pre- and posttreatment samples positively
correlated with the proportional 2-week change in Ki67
(Fig. 7D; r ¼ 0.26, P ¼ 0.03). In addition, we investigated whether
the glycolytic components monitored in the AI setting could
also be responsible for patient stratiﬁcation in breast cancers

analysis revealed that patients characterized by higher levels of
HK2 (HR ¼ 1.72, P ¼ 0.0015), MCT4 (HR ¼ 1.46, P ¼ 0.019), or
GLUT1 (HR ¼ 1.36, P ¼ 0.062) showed poorer relapse-free
survival when compared with lower expressing tumors (Supplementary Fig. S10A–S10C). Crucially, high miR-155–expressing
tumors also showed a poorer prognosis (HR ¼ 3.62, P ¼ 0.0048;
Supplementary Fig. S10D), suggesting that miR-155 and glycolysis could also have a role in tamoxifen response. These data
support the concept that glycolytic metabolism plays an important role in the response and adaptation of breast cancer patients
to AI treatment and potentially to other endocrine agents, such as
tamoxifen.

As our in vitro data suggested miR-155 as a key component of

wanted to validate whether this could be of clinical relevance.
Therefore, we analyzed by qRT-PCR the expression levels of miR155 in 64 ERþ and HER2 breast cancer patients before undergoing anastrozole treatment (33). Ki67 levels were also monitored before and after 2 weeks of anastrozole treatment and used
as an indicator of therapy response (15). Notably, pretreatment

Pretreatment miR-155 levels did not show a signiﬁcant correlation with pretreatment Ki67 levels (r ¼ 0.22, P ¼ 0.08), thus
excluding a possible association between miR-155 and proliferation. These results indicate that high miR-155 levels correlate
with poor response to anastrozole therapy, reinforcing the idea
that miR-155 plays a role in the response and adaptation of breast
cancer patients to AI treatment.

Discussion
Resistance to AI therapy is an important clinical challenge as AIs
have become the standard of care for many patients, particularly
in the western world. Current preclinical data suggest that a
fundamental role in developing resistance is played by growth
factor–induced signaling pathways and clinical trials have shown
encouraging results. However, cancer cells are highly plastic and
eventually undergo signaling rewiring when trying to block a
growth-driving signaling pathway: this could explain why targeting downstream pathway hubs (e.g., mTOR) or impacting directly
on tumor cell cycle (e.g., cyclin-dependent kinases; ref. 34) gave
better results than targeting single growth factor receptors. Metabolic adaptation is essential to satisfy the different energetic
requirements that support a cancer cell during proliferation, exit
from the primary site (dissemination), and engraftment to distal
tissues. As such, we investigated primarily whether metabolic
reprogramming could be responsible for breast cancer cell adaptation to LTED and whether metabolic targeting could be of any
beneﬁt in AI-sensitive and AI-resistant in vitro models.
Several recent studies have reported that OXPHOS metabolism
is associated with aggressiveness of cancer cells (35) and characterizes cancer cells that have developed resistance to different
chemotherapeutic agents in various cancer models (36, 37).
Conversely, reprogramming toward a hyperglycolytic metabo-

1622 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

lism has been associated with resistance to biologic agents such
as Herceptin and Avastin in breast cancer (12, 38). To study the
metabolic reprogramming that a cell undergoes in response and
resistance to AI treatment, we have used an array of different in
vitro and in vivo models. As breast cancer cell lines are characterized
by low or no expression of endogenous aromatase, we have used
cells transfected with the human aromatase gene to study AI
response. In addition, we have used ERþ cells adapted to LTED
to study AI resistance, as lack of estrogen in the medium mimics
the hormone withdrawal that occurs during AI treatment. However, such models have some limitations, that is, MCF7 cells
overexpressing aromatase do not account for the fact that androgen to estrogen conversion predominantly occurs in the stromal
cells of breast cancers, and LTED models cannot mimic the
rewiring that cancer cells undergo when chronically treated with
an AI. Therefore, to conﬁrm the clinical relevance of our in vitro
ﬁndings, we have used tumor biopsies derived from patients
enrolled in neoadjuvant trials of AIs and a xenograft model that
mimics letrozole clinical treatment. To identify the metabolic
pathways associated with AI resistance, we ﬁrst analyzed the
expression of key glycolytic components and performed tracking
radioactive assays in ERþ breast cancer cells and then assessed the
expression of glycolytic-related genes MCT4 and GLUT1 in publicly available clinical datasets. Doyen and colleagues reported the
increased expression of GLUT1 and MCT4 in triple-negative breast
cancers. Importantly, their expression levels correlate with worse
clinical outcome. In particular, MCT4 was suggested to be a new
independent prognostic factor in breast cancer (39). Our data
implies that AI-resistant patients are characterized by enhanced
MCT4 and GLUT1 expression (i.e., hyperglycolytic phenotype)
and therefore may have a potential value in predicting AI
response. In addition, we observed reduced expression of the
glycolytic-related components GLUT1 and HK2 in a human
xenograft model that were responsive to treatment with letrozole.

Taken together, our results highlight a "glycolysis dependency" of
the MCF7-LTED cells and of the AI-sensitive xenograft. Furthermore, letrozole sensitivity of MCF7-2A cells was potentiated in
vitro by concomitant antiglycolytic agent administration. To our
surprise, however, targeting glycolytic metabolism in AI-resistant
MCF7-LTED cells did not impact on cell survival. Indeed, these
cells were capable of switching from glycolysis to OXPHOS
metabolism; furthermore, 2-DG treatment enhanced their promigratory and proinvasive capabilities. This different response
might explain the discrepancy in 2-DG clinical trials. In fact, it has
been reported that luminal B breast cancers show a higher FDGPET signal (i.e., higher glucose uptake) when compared with
luminal A (40). Notably, luminal B tumors have poorer prognosis
compared with luminal A with an increased risk of early relapse
and resistance to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy (41). This
suggests that the acquisition of a hyperglycolytic phenotype

correlates with aggressive clinical features of the luminal B subtype. Consequently, 2-DG used in combination with standard
therapy regimes could be beneﬁcial if patient subsets are characterized and properly assigned. For example, in the preclinical
models described here, combining glycolysis targeting with 2-DG
might be beneﬁcial in the AI-sensitive tumors but detrimental to
AI-resistant ones. In particular, our data support the concept that
the aggressive features of tumor cells are not necessarily linked to a
speciﬁc steady-state metabolic phenotype. Conversely, such
tumors are characterized by a "dynamic" phenotype that confers
to cancer cells many escape routes to bypass signaling, metabolic
and/or motile blockades; this plasticity allows cancer cells adaption to target treatments and is ultimately responsible for resistance and relapse.
We therefore explored the molecular components that could be
responsible for the metabolic and motile reprogramming that

MCF7 cells undergo under LTED conditions and after 2-DG
treatment. Deregulation of miRNA expression has been demonstrated in many types of cancer and the involvement of miRNAs
has been previously described in breast cancer etiology (42) and
in endocrine therapy response and resistance (43). For example,
miR-221/222 was able to confer tamoxifen resistance (44), while
reexpression of miR-375 (45), let-7 (46), miR-342 (47), or miR320 (48) induced tamoxifen sensitivity. As the metabolic plasticity described in the current article was exclusive to the LTED
cells that retain ER expression, that is, MCF7, but not in those who
lose it during LTED adaptation, for example, ZR75-1, we focused
our attention on those miRNAs known to be regulated by ER
signaling.
miR-155 was found to be associated with metastasis events
and invasive properties of breast cancer (49) and E2 has been
shown to upregulate miR-155 expression in MCF7 cells (29).
Furthermore, miR-155 ectopic overexpression in MCF7 cells
induced the upregulation of the key glycolytic enzyme HK2
(30). Indeed, Jiang and colleagues showed that miR-155 promotes HK2 transcription by activation of STAT3 and via targeting C/EBPb (a transcriptional activator for miR-143); miR-155
represses miR-143, a negative regulator of HK2, thus resulting
in upregulation of HK2 expression at the posttranscriptional
level (30). In addition, miR-155 transfection increases the
motility of lymphoma cells by impacting on RhoA activity and
RhoA downstream effectors regulating stress ﬁber formation
and actin polymerization (50).
As miR-155 and miR-143 expression levels were found to
be deregulated in MCF7-LTED cells, we hypothesized that miR155 could be responsible for the altered metabolism observed
in these cells and for the motile and invasive abilities displayed.
Notably, impairing ER signaling by adding letrozole to androstenedione-treated MCF7-2A cells or by ICI182,780 administration in MCF7-LTED cells, conﬁrms ER dependency of miR155 expression. Moreover, it suggests why ER ZR751-LTED
cells do not have such characteristics. This was further conﬁrmed in the xenograft-derived samples, where miR-155
expression was signiﬁcantly decreased following ER signaling
impairment, induced by in vivo letrozole administration.
Crucially, we identify miR-155 levels to be signiﬁcantly
associated with response to AI therapy in ERþ breast cancers
and identiﬁed a subset of patients that could beneﬁt from a
combinatorial approach (i.e., high miR-155) rather than an
AI monotherapy. In silico analysis of publicly available datasets
also showed that high miR-155 levels associated with poor
prognosis on tamoxifen. Several studies have reported
that miR-155 levels could be monitored in patients' blood
samples, and that this miRNA is differentially expressed in
breast cancer patients when compared with healthy women
(26, 51, 52). Therefore, our results highlight a potential diagnostic approach and therapeutic intervention based on miR155 patient stratiﬁcation.

Finally, targeting miR-155 with anti-miR agents impairs 2-DG–
induced motility of MCF7-LTED cells and potentiated the effect of
metformin treatment, indicating that miR-155 targeting could
have a potential therapeutic implication in AI-resistant tumors
that retain ER expression.
Here, we show that metabolic reprogramming has a fundamental role in response and adaptation to LTED and therefore
is important for AI therapy response. Particularly, our in vitro, in
vivo, and in silico analyses suggest that concomitant targeting of
glycolysis and the ER signaling pathway may be beneﬁcial in
the AI-sensitive setting but has to be carefully considered in the
AI-resistant setting, where 2-DG treatment may enhance aggressive features of cancer cells. However, miR-155 targeting may be
achieved in the latter scenario and could ameliorate the current
therapeutic strategies, particularly for the AI-resistant setting.
