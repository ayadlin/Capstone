ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) occurs in the majority of cases
with early loco-regional spread and distant metastases at diagnosis, leading to
dismal prognosis with a 5-year overall survival rate moderately over than 5%. This
malignancy is largely resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, but the reasons of the
refractoriness to the therapies is still unknown. Evidence is accumulating to indicate
that the PDAC microenvironment and vascularity strongly contribute to the clinical
features of this disease. In particular, PDAC is characterized by excessive dense
extracellular matrix deposition associated to vasculature collapse and hypoxia with
low drug delivery, explaining at least partly the low efficacy of antiangiogenic drugs
in this cancer. Strategies aimed to modulate tumor stroma favoring vasculature
perfusion and chemotherapeutics delivery are under investigation.

INTRODUCTION

have low stroma and pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs)
are close to the vessels, GEMMs and human PDAC are
characterized by a dense stroma, which is responsible of
a high interstitial pressure and collapsed vessels with and
impaired drug delivery.
This review will focus on the peculiar tumor
angiogenesis and microenvironment in PDAC, and on the
effects of these findings on the efficacy of anti-angiogenic
clinical trials.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is
characterized by a low microvascular density (MVD) as
compared to other tumor types [1]. Therefore, hypoxia
inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial
growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression is increased and
correlates with poor prognosis [2-3]. Another typical
feature of PDAC is the presence of an intense fibroinflammatory reaction, namely desmoplastic reaction
(DR), responsible of an high intratumoral pressure and
solid stress causing vasculature collapse [1, 4].
However, even though the anti-angiogenic
treatments improved survival in subcutaneous and
orthotopic pre-clinical models, the same treatments
resulted ineffective in genetically engineered mouse
models (GEMMs) of PDAC, as well as in clinical trials
[5]. Differently from the transplantable models that

ANGIOGENESIS
AND
TUMOR
MICROENVIRONMENT IN PDAC
Different studies have demonstrated a relationship
between microvascular density (MVD), tumor
VEGF-A levels, and disease progression in PDAC [610]. The functional analysis of the tumor vasculature

has demonstrated that vessels appear collapsed as a
consequence of high interstitial pressure with a low
delivery of small molecules [1, 4]. PDAC is characterized
by a fibro-inflammatory reaction, namely DR, which
consists in an abundant deposition of dense collagen
types I and III bundles, hyaluronic acid and fibronectin,
loss of basement membrane integrity, and invasion of
malignant cells into the interstitial matrix associated with
a disorganized vasculature characterized by vessels with
variable diameters, abnormal multiple branching and
disrupted interendothelial junctions [11-13].
DR is the result of a complex interplay between
pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and PCCs. Co-colture of
these two types of cells or the incubation of PCCs with
PSCs supernatants results in a significant increase of
release of endostatin by PCCs. Moreover, both PSCs and
PCCs produce matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12)
and cathepsin B to cleave endostatin from collagen XVIII.
Endostatin increases hypoxia levels by inhibiting the
angiogenesis and at the same time stimulates the secretion
of MMPs by PSCs [14].
This hypoxic microenviroment, not only contributes
to pro-fibrogenic activity of PSCs but stimulates PSCs to
produce several angiogenic molecules, including VEGF,
fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), platelet derived
growth factor (PDGF), interleukin-8 (IL-8), MMP-9,
and vasohibin-1, resulting in foci of angiogenesis in the
peripheral areas of the tumor [14-15] (Figure 1). High
levels of HIF-α increases, in turn, VEGF-A expression,
and HIF-1α and VEGF-A not only contribute to PDAC
aggressiveness by angiogenesis but also by a direct
stimulation of tumor cell proliferation and metastatic
capacity [2-3]. Stimulation of tumor cell proliferation
and metastatic capacity through the regulation of the
expression of actin-bundling proteins, MMPs and
chemokine receptors, also occurs [16]. Furthermore, in
PDAC other mitogenic and pro-angiogenic growth factors
are over-expressed including transforming growth factor
beta (TBF-β), hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth
factor, and insulin like growth factor [17]. In particular,
once activated, TGF-β receptors phosphorylate SMAD
proteins to form complexes with transcription factor
SMAD4, involved in the regulation of several genes which
control angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling
[18].

pathology and, at the same time, they are more numerous
in PDAC than in the normal adjacent tissue [22-23]. In
addition, PDACs with elevated numbers of infiltrating
MCs and high MVD have a worse prognosis [24-25].
PCCs induce MCs and macrophages migration releasing
chemoattractant molecules, such as colony-stimulating
factor-1 and chemokine ligand 2 [26]. MCs express proangiogenic factors as VEGF-A, FGF-2, PDGF, tryptase,
chymase, and MMPs promoting tumor growth [27-28].
Moreover, MCs promote PSCs proliferation releasing IL13 and tryptase, and PSCs stimulate MCs proliferation
[29].
Tumor-supportive M2-macrophages number is
higher in PDAC than in benign pancreatic pathology
and in normal tissue [22], and correlates with higher
rate of metastasis and poor prognosis [30]. Inhibition of
macrophage recruitment to the tumor microenvironment
by targeting adhesion molecule integrin α4β1 or myeloid
PI3Kγ resulted in a marked decrease of blood vessel
formation in pancreatic cancer models [31].

GENES
INVOLVED
ANGIOGENESIS

PDAC

HIF-1α G1790A and C1772T single nucleotide
polymorphisms appeared more frequently in PDAC,
predicting higher risk for its development [32]. HIF-1α
expression in PSCs results as a sensor of oxygen levels
in pancreatic tissue, inducing an up-regulation of VEGF
levels [15]. Moreover, PSCs improve angiogenesis by
enhancing the levels of angiopoietin-1 and its receptor
Tie-2 mRNA, both involved in the control of tumor
angiogenesis, in PDAC microenvironment [15, 33].
Angiogenic gene signature has been assessed in
PDAC analyzing the levels of 129 angiogenic genes
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). About 35% of
PDACs show an up-regulation of pro-angiogenic genes,
including FGFR-1, and VEGFR-1, −2 and −3, and of
pro-inflammatory genes, such as IL-1B, IL-6, and JAK2,
anti-inflammatory IL-10, as well as histone deacetylase-9,
with a major involvement of TGF-β, which regulates
the smad signal pathway [34]. Most of PDAC show
loss of heterozygosity for SMAD4 locus, with 50% of
PDAC having either homozygous deletion or mutational
inactivation of the second allele. SMAD4 restoration
inhibited both angiogenesis and extracellular matrix
remodeling [18]. Conversely, SMAD4 re-expression in
BxPC3 PCCs fails to suppress angiogenesis in vivo [35].
SMAD4 and nuclear SMAD4 expression correlates with
high levels of CD31, the main endothelial cell-specific
marker [34].
MicroRNAs (miRNA), play an important role in
the regulation of gene expression in PDAC, including
angiogenesis [36]. Hypoxia induces the expression of
miRNA-21 in PDAC cells via HIF-1α allowing cells
to avoid apoptosis [37], at the same time miRNA-21

INFLAMMATION IN PDAC
Inflammatory cells contribute to the proliferative
and invasive capacity of solid and hematological
malignancies [19-21]. PDAC is characterized by an
abundant inflammatory infiltration consisting in cancerassociated fibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells (MCs) and
lymphocytes [12, 22]. MCs are now recognized as critical
components of tumor stromal microenvironment. They
are more numerous in PDAC than in benign pancreatic

acts as an inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation and
migration [38]. In a PDAC model, a lentiviral transported
antimiRNA-21 improved tumor angiogenesis, improving
the flow of gemcitabine with a synergistic antitumoral
effect [39]. Whereas, MiR139 and miR200c resulted
upregulated in primary endothelial cell cultures derived
from PDAC patients, suggesting that they may improve
tumor angiogenesis [40].
Although there has been some progress concerning
angiogenesis gene signature in PDAC, the epigenetic
regulation systems seem to be still poorly known, and
might be used as a possible therapeutic target.

drug delivery due to reduced vascularization [1]. In this
context, murine models have been developed in order to
normalize the vasculature [50] or to reduce the pressure
on the collapsed vessels, [1, 51]. The small molecule LB100, an inhibitor of phosphatase 2A (PP2A), increased
MVD in the PDAC xenograft model resulting in a
higher chemotherapeutics delivery with improvement of
objective response [50].
A recombinant human hyaluronidase conjugated
with polyethylene glycol has been used in KPC mice
PDAC models with a reduction of intratumoral hyaluronan
and a significant improvement of tumor perfusion
without an increase of MVD favouring chemotherapeutic
delivery. KPC mice treated with gemcitabine together
with this drug or gemcitabine alone, show a significantly
increased response and mOS [1]. In a parallel similar
study, Jacobetz et al demonstrate that hyaluronidase
leads to microenvironment changes in endothelium with
an increase of vascular permeability drug permeability,
and an increase of survival in KPC mice treated with
gemcitabine [4]. IPI-926, a derivate of cyclopamine,
targeting Hedgehog pathway by inhibiting Smo, reduced
the collagen-1 content and destroyed tumor-associated
desmoplastic tissue, increased the MVD and concentration
of gemcitabine, in KPC mice model [51]. Nonetheless,
in contrast with this last study, in a Kre PDAC mice
model, both the Shh (Sonic Hedgehog, a peculiar ligand
of Hedgehog pathway) gene delection and Hedgehog
targeting through IPI-926, reduced stromal content, but
generated more aggressive PDAC with a high proliferation
rate and an increased vascularity [52]. Furthermore,
administration of DC101, an antibody blockingVEGFR-2,
in Shh-deleted mice, reduces tumor proliferation inducing
tumoral necrosis through angiogenesis inhibition.
Moreover, inhibition of desmoplasia with depletion of
myofibroblasts, resulted in transgenic mice with shorter
survival and invasive and aggressive PDAC [53].
Despite the fact that many attempts to reduce
the stroma to normalize tumor vascularization led
to interesting results in vivo, most recent data have
highlighted how this approach lead to a more aggressive
phenotype with a lower survival. In parallel, although
classic anti-angiogenic molecules, such as bevacizumab
and sunitinib, has failed to induce tumor regression, the
use of alternative angiogenetic targets, such as SB505124
and ruxolitinib of TGF-β type I receptor kinase and JAK1
phosphorylase, give more promising results in PDAC
treatment.

PRE-CLINICAL
ANTI-ANGIOGENIC
APPROACHES IN PDAC
Several Authors targeted VEGF signaling using
nude mouse models of human PDAC. Injection of PDAC
antisense VEGF-A gene cells into athymic nude mice lead
to an 80% decrease of tumor growth compared with mice
injected with control cells [41]. Engineerization of Panc-1
cells and PK-8 cells to produce a soluble form of the decoy
receptor of VEGF, inoculated in SCID mice, resulted in a
PDAC model with both low MVD and tumor growth [42].
Ziv-aflibercept, a VEGF-Trap, decreased tumor MVD
and suppressed cancer cell proliferation in an orthotopic
model of PDAC [43]. More recently, curcumin analogues
UBS109 and EF31 downregulated angiogenic factors
such as HIF-1α, Hsp90, COX-2 and VEGF in xenograft
models of PDAC showing antitumor and anti-angiogenic
effects [44]. LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) in combination
with gemcitabine and ionizing radiation, inhibited cancer
cell growth, metastasis and angiogenesis targeting PI3K/
MMPs/Ln-5γ2 signaling pathways in xenograft model in
which vasculogenic mimicry occurs. [45]. Ginsenoside
Rg3, a tetracyclic triterpenoid saponin, altered
vasculogenic mimicry process in nude mouse xenografts
of PDAC, downregulating the expression level of VEcadherin, EphA2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA [46]. The
simultaneous target of TGF-βR and JAK1 phosphorylase,
using SB505124 and ruxolitinib suppressed endothelial
activation in 3D co-cultures of PDAC and endothelial cells
by suppressing proliferation and angiogenesis [34].
Experimental models are characterized by an high
vascularity and the absence of desmoplastic reaction, as
instead occurs in human PDAC. To avoid this pitfall, a
GEMM of PDAC characterized by a dense stroma and
collapsed vessels has been developed, using mutant
Kras and p53 alleles in pancreatic cells (KPC) mice
models [47]. In these models, sunitinib , targeting VEGF
and PDGF receptors impair angiogenesis, but fail to
reduce tumor burden [48]. Similarly, gemcitabine plus
bevacizumab did not achieve a statistical increase of
median (m) OS or progression free survival (PFS) [49].
As consequences of hypoperfusion, a reduced
sensitivity to chemotherapy derives from a limitation of

a mOS of 8.8 months with the combination gemcitabine
plus bevacizumab [54], Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized phase III trial of gemcitabine/bevacizumab
versus gemcitabine/placebo in advanced PDAC. Five
hundred and thirty-five patients were enrolled to receive
gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on days
1, 8, and 15 every 28 days and bevacizumab at 10 mg/
kg or placebo on days 1 and 15 every 28 days. In spite
the promising results of the phase II trial, the addition
of bevacizumab to gemcitabine did not improve mOS
of 5.8 and 5.9 months, with a not statistically improved
mPFS of 3.8 and 2.9 months for combination arm and
gemcitabine alone arm, respectively. The only statistically
significant differences in grades 3 and 4 toxicity regarded
hypertension (10% v 3%; P < .001) and proteinuria (5%
v 1%; P = .002) [5]. The Authors imputed the different
results between the two phase trials to the different
selection of patients, i.e. a better PS in the phase II study.
A subsequent study, with the aim to identify
predictive biomarkers of response to bevacizumabcontaining regimen in PDAC has been conducted using
serum from patients enrolled in the CALGB 80303
trial. One hundred and fifty-six proteins were quantified
and authors selected histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG)
and complement factor H (CFH) as possible predictive
markers. Unfortunately, there was no evidence for
interaction with bevacizumab and HRG, but there was

some evidence for a weak positive correlation of HRG
with OS (τ = 0.11 [0.03, 0.19]; P < .01). CFH was found
to be neither a predictive nor a prognostic factor for
OS [55]. Subsequently, on the same setting of patients,
three markers predictive for bevacizumab response were
identified: VEGF-D, SDF1, and Ang-2. In particular,
low levels of VEGF-D were predictive to benefit from
bevacizumab plus gemcitabine arm, whereas, below
median levels of both Ang-2 and SDF1 predicted for
greater benefit in the placebo group [56]. However, the
same authors assert the need to evaluate these markers in
a larger sample in order to select the highest number of
positive and negative predictive markers of response to
anti-angiogenic treatment.
From the evidence that simultaneous inhibition of
EGFR and VEGFR leads to better target angiogenesis,
a phase III trial tested the use of bevacizumab added to
the association gemcitabine-erlotinib. Three hundred
and one PDAC patients were randomly assigned to
receive gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)/week), erlotinib
(100 mg/day), with or without bevacizumab (5 mg/
kg every 2 weeks). Despite a good safety profile and a
better significant PFS (HR 0.73;P = .0002) of the triplet
schedule, the addition of bevacizumab did not show
a statistically significant improvement in terms of OS
(7.1 and 6.0 months in the bevacizumab and placebo
arms, respectively, HR 0.89; P = .2087) [57]. Similarly
negative results were achieved in phase III trials using

combination of gemcitabine with anti-angiogenic agents
such as axitinib [58], sorafenib [59], and ZIV-aflibercept
[60]. In a phase II randomized trial, sunitinib , a tyrosine
kinases inhibitor, compared to observation alone showed
a PFS at six months of 22.2% and 3.6%, a 2 years OS of
22.9% and 7.1%, respectively, in the maintenance therapy
after a gemcitabine -based first line [61]. Even so, a not
significant superiority was achieved for the combination of
Sunitinib and Gemcitabine in a randomized phase II trial
in first line locally advanced or metastatic PDAC [62].
Moreover, Elpamotide, a peptide VEGFR-2 vaccine
inducing a cellular immune response against VEGFR-2
expressing endothelial cells, did not improved mOS
or PFS compared to gemcitabine alone, although the
subgroup that showed severe side effects at the injection
site apparently had a better outcome [63]. Probably
the failure of anti-angiogenesis could depend on the
absence of predictors of response, moreover, only 35% of
PDAC seems to have an angiogenic phenotype [34, 64].
Ramucirumab, a recombinant fully human monoclonal
antibody directed against human VEGFR-2, is under
investigation in a phase II study, evaluating the efficacy
and safety of FOLFIRINOX plus ramucirumab (Arm A)
vs. FOLFIRINOX plus placebo (Arm B) in 94 subjects
with advanced pancreatic cancer [65].
As mentioned above in the pre-clinical studies, lack
of response may derive from high interstitial pressures
and collapse of tumor vasculature. In fact, targeting
stromal microenvironment elements could be an efficient
therapeutic strategy in addition to classical and new
chemoterapic agents [1]. The possible therapeutic role of
PEGPH20, has been recently investigated in a randomized
phase II trial. The study enrolled untreated patients
with metastatic PDAC to receive nab-paclitaxel and
gemcitabine (nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 plus gemcitabine
1000 mg/m2 given IV x1/week 3/4 weeks per cycle)
combined with PEGPH20 (3ug/kg IV x 2/week for cycle
1 and weekly for cycle 2 and beyond, PAG) or placebo
(AG). Following an initial clinical withdrawal for the
evidence of several thromboembolic events (29% and 15%
for PAG and AG, respectively) the trial was started again
with a prevention treatment with low molecular weight
heparin, and concluded that in hyaluronan-high expression
patients receiving PAG and AG, the ORR was 52% vs
24% respectively (P = .038), while there was no difference
in 37% vs 38% hyaluronan-low expression patients.
Moreover PFS was increased in patients with hyaluronanhigh expression, 9.2 and 4.3 for PAG and AG, respectively,
and a there was a positive trend in OS [66]. On the basis of
these results, a phase III trial of PAG has been started [67].
Based on encouraging preclinical data in Hedgehog signal
role inhibition in tumor-associated stroma [51], IPI-926,
an oral Hedgehog inhibitor, was evaluated in combination
with FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan,
oxaliplatin) in a multicenter phase Ib study. Patients were
treated with once-daily IPI-926 plus FOLFIRINOX
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

at 3 + 3 dose escalation design. The combination was
generally well tolerated, with common treatment-related
adverse events such as liver function test abnormalities,
neuropathy, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Patients
presented a promising ORR of 67%, with evident decline
of CA19-9 levels [68]. Unfortunately, a phase II trial of
IPI-926 plus gemcitabine was closed early due to an initial
detrimental effect of this combination [69]. Furthermore,
the MMP inhibitor marimastat was tested in patients with
PDAC, based on the data that aberrant MMP expression
is observed in this neoplasm. Bramhall et al. designed
a phase III randomised study on 239 PDAC patients to
compare orally administered marimastat in combination
with gemcitabine to gemcitabine alone. There was no
significant difference in OS between combination and
gemcitabine plus placebo arm (P = 0.95), with a 1-year
survival of 18% and 17%, respectively. Also no significant
advantage was seen in ORR (11 and 16% respectively), in
PFS (P = 0.68) and in time to treatment failure (P = 0.70)
between the treatment arms [70].
In the future, the PDAC patients will be selected
for the use of anti-angiogenic therapy through the
angiogenetic signature. Moreover, the target of stroma
through Hedgehog inhibitors or hyaluronidase enzymes
together with actual standard therapies will plays a key
role in the treatment of this malignancy. The main clinical
trials are in progress are summarized in Table 1.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The hypothesis that the peculiar stroma is
responsible of chemoresistance in PDAC explains the low
efficacy of anti-angiogenic agents in PDAC treatment.
On the other hand, this biological property of PDAC
microenvironment has led to suggest the depletion
of tumor stroma as a strategy for PDAC treatment.
However, this approach seems contradictory because in
some GEMM studies stromal depletion with increased
tumor vascularity and drug diffusion resulted efficacious,
resulting in increasing survival. In the meantime, other
studies have demonstrated that increased vasculature
correlates with disease progression. In this context,
strategies aimed to achieve a more precise and efficacious
modulation of desmoplasia and tumor vascularity in
PDAC are necessary.
