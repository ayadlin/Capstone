ABSTRACT
As a cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor, p27 is frequently misregulated
in human cancers. Increased degradation is the most common mechanism of
misregulation, however in some cancers, p27 is mislocalized from its cell cycle
inhibitory location in the nucleus, to the cytoplasm. In normal cells cytoplasmic
p27 has functions that are distinct from its cell cycle-regulatory nuclear functions.
Therefore, an important question is whether localization of p27 to the cytoplasm
in tumor cells is primarily a mechanism for cancelling its inhibitory effect on cell
proliferation, or whether cytoplasmic p27 has more direct oncogenic actions. To study
p27 mislocalization in human cancers we screened a panel of common breast cancer
cell lines. We observed that p27 accumulated in the cytoplasm exclusively in cell
lines that are Her2+. To address the significance of p27 mislocalization in Her2+
breast cancer cells we interrogated the cellular response to the dual-Her2/EGFR
kinase inhibitor, lapatinib. Knockdown of p27 using shRNA sensitized Her2+ cells to
lapatinib-induced apoptosis. Moreover, expression of a constitutively cytoplasmic
form of p27 (p27ΔNLS) reversed the lapatinib-induced apoptosis, suggesting that
cytoplasmic p27 contributed to lapatinib resistance in Her2+ breast cancer cells by
suppressing apoptosis. Our results suggest that p27 localization may be useful as a
predictive biomarker of therapeutic response in patients with Her2+ breast cancers.

p27 correlates with poor prognosis and survival in many
types of cancers.
Surprisingly, p27-haploinsufficient mice are more
sensitive to ErbB2/Neu induced transformation compared
to p27 null mice [7]. Similarly, in mice lacking the
homeobox gene Nkx3.1 and the tumor suppressor PTEN,
prostate carcinogenesis was enhanced when one allele of
p27 was lost, while cancer progression was inhibited when
both alleles of p27 were deleted [8]. These observations
suggest that while p27 is a tumor suppressor, partial loss
of p27 function is more oncogenic than complete loss,
although the mechanisms for this remain unclear.

INTRODUCTION
p27Kip1 (hereafter p27) negatively regulates the
G1 to S phase progression by binding to and inhibiting
cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) [1]. p27 knock out mice
have multiorgan hyperplasia and spontaneously develop
pituitary tumors, supporting the tumor suppressor role
of p27 [2–4]. Unlike other cell cycle inhibitors such as
p16 and p21, which are frequently mutated or deleted in
human cancers, genetic alterations of p27 are rare. Rather,
p27 is misregulated in cancers by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms [5, 6]. Likewise, low levels of

The finding that p27 has functions in addition to
its role as a cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor
has important implications for understanding p27
misregulation in cancer. Mice expressing a form of p27
that is unable to bind or inhibit cyclin-CDK complexes,
known as p27CK-, develop hyperplastic lesions and
tumors in multiple organs. Moreover, the pituitary tumors
in these mice are more aggressive compared to p27 null
mice, suggesting p27 may have oncogenic functions [9].
How p27 changes it role from a tumor suppressor to a
tumor promoter is poorly understood, but this may result
when p27 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm. Indeed,
p27CK- was detected in the cytoplasm in urethane
induced lung tumors, and cytoplasmic localization of p27
correlated with K-Ras induced cell transformation [10,
11]. In MCF7 breast cancer cells, when a mutant form
of p27 which exclusively localized to the cytoplasm was
overexpressed, cell motility and survival increased [12].
Likewise, knock down of p27 in a glioma cell line in
which p27 is localized predominantly to the cytoplasm
decreased tumorigenicity [12]. Consistently, cytoplasmic
expression of p27 induced melanoma motility and
metastases [13], and nuclear sequestration of p27 by
PI-3K inhibition reduced tumorigenesis in a mouse lung
cancer model [14]. Cytoplasmic p27 contributes to cell
migration by interacting with the GTPase RhoA and
the microtubule destabilizing protein Stathmin and this
may, in part, promote tumor progression and metastasis
[15–17].
Cytoplasmic p27 has been detected in many
human cancers, including melanoma, ovarian carcinoma,
renal cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, acute myelogenous
leukemia, and breast cancer. Mislocalization of p27
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is generally associated
with poor prognosis and survival, high tumor grade and
metastasis [13, 18–22], suggesting a potential application
of cytoplasmic p27 as a clinical prognostic marker.
However, the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic p27 is
oncogenic, and may impact responses to therapeutics,
remain incompletely understood.
Multiple mechanisms misregulate p27 in tumors.
Increased expression of Skp2, the predominant ubiquitin
ligase that targets p27 for degradation, has been
correlated with decreased p27 levels and poor prognosis
in young women with breast cancer and in patients with
Her2− breast tumors [23, 24]. Also, cytoplasmic p27 in
some primary breast tumors has been correlated with
activation of the serine/threonine kinase, AKT. Since p27
is a substrate for AKT, it has been proposed that p27 is
sequestered in the cytoplasm through phosphorylation on
T157 [20, 25, 26].
Amplification of Her2 occurs in 15–20% of breast
tumors and correlates with poor prognosis [27, 28].
Treatment of Her2+ breast cancer cells with the Her2−
specific antibody trastuzumab or the dual-Her2/EGFR

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitor Lapatinib results in cell cycle arrest, possibly
due to increased p27 protein levels [29]. However, the
role of cytoplasmic p27 in breast cancer and targeted
therapy hasn’t been fully assessed. Here we show that
p27 becomes mislocalized to the cytoplasm specifically
in Her2+ breast cancer cells released into cell cycle from
mitogen deprivation induced arrest. As expected Lapatinib
treatment blocked Her2+ cell proliferation, and also
prevented p27 cytoplasmic mislocalization. Moreover
p27 silencing by shRNA decreased lapatinib-induced
cell cycle arrest, indicating that nuclear p27 contributes
to this arrest. All of these results were consistent with
p27’s canonical tumor suppressor function as a CDKinhibitor. However, we also found that cytoplasmic p27
suppressed lapatinib-induced apoptosis, and that the net
effect of decreasing p27 was to sensitize Her2+ cancer
cells to lapatinib. This indicated, for the first time, that the
tumorigenic effect of cytoplasmic p27 might be mediated
by a suppression of apoptosis, which we suggest may
cause increased resistance to anti-tumor therapies that
induce cancer cell death.

RESULTS
P27 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm in Her2+
breast cancer cells
To investigate p27 regulation in human breast cancer,
we compared p27 protein levels in quiescent (serum starved)
and proliferating cells in a panel of Her2− and Her2+
breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A). Cells were synchronized
by serum starvation and released into the cell cycle upon
mitogen stimulation. As seen in normal cells, p27 protein
abundance decreased when the immortalized, but nontumorigenic breast cell line MCF10A was stimulated with
mitogens to enter the cell cycle. A similar pattern was
seen in breast cancer cell lines representing subtypes other
than Her2+ breast cancers (Fig.1A and data not shown).
Unexpectedly, p27 remained abnormally high in Her2+ cell
lines, even after 48 hrs of serum stimulation. Consistent with
the western blots, immunofluorescence staining showed that
p27 steadily declined when Her2− cells begin proliferating
(Fig. 1B, HCC38, Supplemental Fig.1, HCC1395 and data
not shown). In contrast, whereas nuclear p27 abundance
decreased in Her2+ cells, p27 accumulated in the cytoplasm
upon serum stimulation (Fig. 1B, UACC893, Supplemental
Fig.1, HCC1419 and data not shown). In addition, cells
located in the middle of the cell cluster, an area where cell
proliferation is inhibited by contact inhibition, exhibited the
largest amount of cytoplasmic p27. These data suggested
that p27 was regulated differently during the cell cycle
depending on Her2+ status. That is, p27 is degraded in the
nucleus as Her2− breast cancer cells and MCF10A cells
progress through the cell cycle, but is instead mislocalized
to cytoplasm in Her2+ cells.

Lapatinib induces p27 nuclear re-distribution
and cell cycle arrest in Her2+ breast cancer cells

significantly increased cell proliferation compared with
nuclear p27.
Her2 inhibition with therapeutics such as
trastuzumab or lapatinib leads to an increase in p27
protein levels, which is speculated to be important for
these reagents’ anti-proliferative effects [29]. We thus
investigated the response of Her2+ cells to lapatinib
treatment by co-immunostaining of p27 and BrdU. We
found that cell proliferation stopped upon Lapatinib
treatment, as measured by BrdU incorporation (Fig. 2B).
Even after a 13 hr pulse labeling, very few cells were BrdU
positive. Importantly, lapatinib treatment also caused these
cells, which exhibit p27 cytoplasmic mislocalization, to
express nuclear rather than cytoplasmic p27.
We next determined if nuclear p27 accumulation
played a causal role in lapatinib-mediated cell cycle arrest,
or was simply a secondary effect of cell cycle arrest. First,
we examined p27 expression during cell cycle re-entry
to address whether lapatinib induced nuclear p27 before
or after cell cycle arrest. At the indicated time points

We investigated the relationship between p27
localization and cell proliferation by labeling cells with
BrdU for 5 hr and co-immunostaining the cells with
p27 and BrdU antibodies (Fig. 2A). Cells were classed
in three categories: those with p27 exclusively in the
cytoplasm (indicated by white arrow), with high nuclear
p27, (indicated by blue arrow), and with low p27 in both
the nucleus and cytoplasm (indicated by yellow arrow).
Consistent with its cell cycle inhibitory role in the nucleus,
BrdU was rarely detected in cells with high nuclear p27
(blue arrow). Quantification of 50 cell clusters (80–150
cells per cluster) indicated that 12% of the cells with high
nuclear p27 were BrdU positive, whereas 50% of the
cells with low nuclear (yellow arrow) had incorporated
BrdU. Cells with p27 exclusively localized to the
cytoplasm (white arrow) also hyper-proliferated (25%
BrdU positive). Cytoplasmic p27 thus correlated with

(indicated by yellow arrow) and 3) cells with p27 exclusively in the cytoplasm (indicated by white arrow). BrdU positive cells from at least
10 cell clusters were quantified. The average percentage of BrdU positive cells/cluster in each category were graphed (error bars-STDEV).

after lapatinib treatment, cells were fixed to evaluate p27
localization by immunostaining or BrdU pulse labeled
(2 hrs) to evaluate their cell cycle distribution by flow
cytometry (Fig. 3A). Whereas the percentage of cells in S
phase didn’t significantly drop until 12 hrs after treatment
with lapatinib, nuclear p27 accumulation began as early as 8
hrs after treatment, at which point the number of cell clusters
exhibited nuclear p27 in most cells increased from 14% to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

32%. Thus p27 nuclear accumulation preceded cell cycle
arrest, supporting the hypothesis that p27 was a cause, rather
than a consequence, of lapatinib’s anti-proliferative effect.
To directly determine the requirement for p27
expression in lapatinib-induced cell cycle arrest, we
knocked down p27 with shRNA in UACC893 and BT474
cells (Fig. 3B). As expected, decreased levels of p27 led
to an increased rate of proliferation, as evaluated by cell

number (Fig. 3C). We then synchronized cells by serum
starvation/restimulation and examined the effect of p27
shRNA on the ability of lapatinib to arrest the cell cycle.
Unlike the control cells, which underwent cell cycle arrest
upon lapatinib treatment, a much greater percentage of
cells expressing p27 shRNA entered S-phase, as shown
by incorporation of BrdU (Fig. 3D). Induced nuclear
accumulation of p27 thus appeared essential for laptinib’s
anti-proliferative effect.

after lapatinib treatment in both UACC893 and BT474
cells, as shown by cleaved-caspase3 (hereafter caspase3)
immunostaining. This increase in apoptosis counter-acted
the increased ability of p27-knockdown cells to enter S
phase, the net effect being increased drug sensitivity.
These results suggested that cytoplasmic p27 was
not simply null with respect to function, but might promote
tumorigenesis by suppressing cell death. Alternatively,
increased cell death in p27 knockdown cells may be an
indirect effect caused by inappropriate cell cycling after
exposure to lapatinib. To distinguish between these two
hypotheses, we expressed a constitutively cytoplasmic
p27 mutant (p27ΔNLS) in UACC893 and BT474 cells,
in which endogenous p27 expression was silenced by
shRNA that did not target the ectopic p27 expression. We
confirmed that p27ΔNLS did not enter the nucleus, and
was unable to inhibit cell proliferation [12]. p27ΔNLS
was expressed at levels comparable to endogenous p27
(Fig. 5A) and localized predominantly in the cytoplasm,
even after lapatinib treatment (Fig. 5B). Importantly
the replacement of endogenous p27 with P27ΔNLS
reversed lapatinib sensitivity in BT474 and UACC893
cells (Fig. 5C) and reduced lapaitinib-induced apoptosis

ShRNA inhibition of p27 sensitizes Her2+ cells to
lapatinib-induced apoptosis
Our observations raised the question whether
cytoplasmic p27 in Her2+ tumor cells had potentially
oncogenic consequences beyond simply reducing nuclear
(anti-proliferative) p27. To address this, we measured the
effect of lapatinib on the viability of UACC893 and BT474
cells after p27 knockdown. Remarkably, we found that
p27 knockdown rendered Her2+ cells hypersensitive to
lapatinib treatment, as measured by the number of viable
cells 72 hrs after drug treatment (Fig. 4A). As shown in
Fig. 4B, p27 knockdown caused increased apoptosis

abundant cytoplasmic p27. One proposed mechanism
involves sequestration of the tumor suppressor PTEN
by cytoplasmic p27, which inhibits PTEN by preventing
its nuclear translocation [33]. AKT is thought to prevent
p27 nuclear localization in breast cancer cells by
phosphorylating p27 within its nuclear localization signal
on T157 [20, 25, 26]. Moreover, in renal cell carcinoma
cells, inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway reduced p27
T157 phosphorylation and restored its nuclear localization
[34]. Since Her2 signaling activates AKT, we considered
that lapatinib might promote p27 nuclear relocalization
by inhibiting phosphorylation of p27 by AKT. However,
whereas lapatinib treatment decreased AKT activity in
Her2+ cells, we found that p27 cytoplasmic localization
was unaffected by inhibition of AKT activity using an
AKT specific inhibitor (Supplemental Figs. 2A–2B).
Thus, other pathways(s) down stream of Her2 exist which
controls the cytoplasmic retention of p27. Identification
of such pathway(s) would not only improve our
understanding of the mechanism of p27 mislocalization
but also provide insight into new therapeutic targets.

DISCUSSION
Cytoplasmic p27 is associated with poor prognosis
in multiple human cancers including breast cancer, but
its mechanisms of mislocalization and role in therapeutic
responses are poorly understood. In this study, we
examined Her2+ breast cancer cells, in which we found
that p27 was mislocalized in the cytoplasm, and this
finding is supported by Andre et al., who reported that a
low p27 nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio correlated with Her2
expression in human breast cancer [30]. In addition to its
role as a cell cycle inhibitor, p27 also regulates apoptosis.
We previously found that p27 depletion caused increased
apoptosis in cells deprived of growth factors and that
CDK2 activity was consistently enhanced in these cases,
suggesting that the CDK2 inhibition by p27 is instrumental
in blocking apoptosis [31, 32]. Here we show that
treatment of Her2+ breast cancer cell lines with lapatinib
blocks cell proliferation, and that this is associated with
increased nuclear p27 abundance in conjunction with
decreased cytoplasmic p27. These results suggested that
nuclear p27 relocalization was required for lapatinib
induced cell cycle arrest, which we confirmed by using
p27shRNA to prevent p27 nuclear accumulation. Although
p27 knockdown caused lapatinib-treated Her2+ cells
to continue to proliferate, this was also associated with
increased apoptosis, consistent with the role of enhanced
CDK2 activity in promoting apoptosis. The combined
impact of these seemingly opposite consequences of
p27 knockdown (increased proliferation and increased
apoptosis) was to increase the sensitivity of Her2+ cells
to lapatinib treatment.
Because Her2+ breast cancer cells exhibit p27
mislocalization rather than reduced p27 abundance, we
determined the role of p27 cytoplasmic mislocalization
in apoptotic responses by expressing a constitutively
cytoplasmic p27 mutant, which actively suppressed
lapatinib-induced apoptosis. These data suggested that in
addition to preventing its role as a CDK inhibitor in the
nucleus, cytoplasmic p27 mislocalization had another role
in determining lapatinib responses, by actively suppressing
apoptosis. However, since cytoplasmic p27 re-expression
only partially rescued apoptosis in p27 knockdown cells, it is
likely that both p27 functions (apoptosis suppression in the
cytoplasm and CDK2 inhibition in the nucleus) play roles in
modulating apoptotic responses to lapatinib treatment
Although the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic
p27 blocks apoptosis are unknown, this appears to be a
widespread feature of cancer cells, and related findings
have been reported in mitogen-depleted MCF7 breast
cancer cells [12] and in U87-MG glioma cells, that express

Na-Borate for 12 min at room temperature to neutralize
HCl. Coverslips were then washed and incubated with
anti-BrdU antibody for 1 hour. After washing, coverslips
were incubated with Alexa-488 conjugated secondary
antibody for 30 min in dark. Coverslips were washed
and mounted on glass slides with anti-fade containing
dapi. Slides were visualized on a Nikon Eclipse 800
microscope and images were obtained with a 20 x
objective using a Spot charge-coupled-device camera
(Diagnostic Instrument).
For quantification of p27 localization, cells from at
least 50 cell clusters were counted. For each cluster, if the
ratio of cells with p27 exclusively in the nucleus to cells
with p27 exclusively in the cytoplasm was greater than 1,
the cell cluster was scored as “nuclear” (n). If the ratio is
less than 1, the cell cluster was scored as “cytoplasmic”
(c). If the ratio was equal to 1, the cell cluster was scored
as “cytoplasmic + nuclear” (n + c). For quantification of
apoptotic cells, caspase 3 positive cells were counted from
at least 10 cell clusters.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in buffer consisting of 50 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 10%
glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease/phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail. 30 μg of protein was loaded onto SDSPAGE gels for western blotting. For detection of p27,
γ-tubulin and Akt, membranes were blocked in buffer
consisting of PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% milk for 10
min at room temperature. For detection of phosphorylated
Akt, membranes were blocked in buffer consisting of TBS,
0.1% Tween-20 and 5% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature.
Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with secondary
antibodies for 2 hrs at room temperature.

Cell proliferation and drug sensitivity assay
For analysis of cell proliferation, cells were seeded
at a density of 3 x 105 cells/ 60mm plate. At the indicated
time points, cells were trypsinized and viability was
determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were counted
using a hemocytometer. For drug sensitivity assays, cells
were incubated in serum free medium for 72 hrs for
synchronization 2 days after seeding. Cells were then
switched into medium with serum for 48 hrs followed
by lapatinib treatment for 72 hrs. Cell viability was
determined by trypan blue exclusion. The survival rate
was calculated by normalizing the cell number under drug
treatment to vehicle (DMSO treatment). Experiments were
repeated for three times.

Immunofluorescence and quantitation
Cells were seeded on glass coverslips and
treated as described, followed by fixation in 2%
paraformaldehyde in PBS at 37°C for 20 min. For
detection of p27 and caspase 3, cells were permeabilized
for 6 min in 0.2% Triton-X100, blocked for 30 min in
blocking buffer (1x PBS, 0.1% goat serum) and stained
for 1.5 hrs with primary antibodies. The coverslips
were then washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor647-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min in
the dark. After washing, coverslips were mounted
on glass slides with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent
containing DAPI (Invitrogen). BrdU immunostaining
was performed according to the manufacture’s protocol
(Abcam) with some modification. Briefly, for p27 and
BrdU double immunostaining, cells were pulse labeled
with 25 μM of BrdU for 5–13 hrs before fixation. After
p27 immunostaining and washing, coverslips were
incubated in HCl (2N) for 25 min at room temperature
followed by incubation for 20 min at 37°C. Coverslips
