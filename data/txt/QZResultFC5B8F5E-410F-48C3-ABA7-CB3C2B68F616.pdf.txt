BACKGROUND. The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are divided into low-risk
and high-risk diseases. Predictive models for response to growth factors (GF)
have been developed based on red blood cell transfusion needs and erythropoietin levels. For low-risk MDS the optimal initial therapy (GF vs nongrowth factor
[NGF] therapies, including differentiation and immunomodulatory agents) based
on response rates to NGF and GF and survival, has not been defined.

METHODS. A Markov decision analysis was performed on 799 low-risk MDS

apy. The treatment strategies analyzed included initial GF or NGF therapies,
assuming 3 different states: Patients were either in the good GF predictive group
GF predictive group (high transfusion needs and high erythropoietin levels).

RESULTS. In the good GF predictive group, initial therapy with GF improved survival compared with NGF therapies at 3.38 years vs 2.57 years for a typical MDS
patient. The advantage of GF to NGF was lost when NGF therapies produced a
response in 46% of patients. In the intermediate or poor GF predictive groups,
NGF maximized survival, provided response rates for NGF were >14% and 4%,
respectively, for each predictive group. Quality of life adjustment did not alter the
preferred strategy.

CONCLUSIONS. Modeling estimates suggest that patients who fall into a good GF
predictive group should almost always receive GF initially, whereas those in intermediate and poor predictive groups should almost always be treated with NGF.

T

he myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a spectrum of
heterogeneous hematopoietic disorders in which blood cells are
derived from abnormal multipotent progenitor cells, with resultant
peripheral blood cytopenias involving 1 or more lineages.1–3 Attention to cytogenetic features, clinical parameters (including the numbers and types of peripheral blood cytopenias and transfusion
needs), and morphologic characteristics is crucial in determining
prognosis, as has been demonstrated with the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)4 and the World Health Organization
Prognostic Scoring System.5
Whereas MDS can be subclassified into various subtypes,
depending on the pathologic classification system applied,6,7 in
broad strokes these disorders are divided into ‘‘low-risk,’’ or indolent
disease, in which pro-apoptotic forces predominate (frequently defined as ‘‘Low’’ or ‘‘Int-1’’ under the IPSS), and ‘‘high-risk,’’ or
aggressive disease, in which pro-proliferative factors prevail (fre-

quently defined as ‘‘Int-2’’ or ‘‘High’’ by the IPSS). In
low-risk MDS, hematopoietic precursors have an
impaired survival, due in part to the presence of inhibitory or inflammatory cytokines and enhanced
angiogenesis.8–10 Therapeutic approaches capitalize
on these distinctions. Thus, drugs that have shown
more efficacy in high-risk MDS are pro-differentiating, promote the transcription of tumor suppressor
genes, or are directly cytotoxic, whereas agents targeting low-risk MDS stimulate the remaining effective hematopoiesis and/or abrogate the effects of
negative stimulatory cytokines. Recognizing this, and
to standardize variable definitions of outcome, an
International Working Group (IWG) created universal
measures of response to therapy in MDS.11,12
Once low-risk MDS patients require regular red
blood cell transfusions, hematopoietic growth factor
(GF) therapy (including recombinant erythropoietin
alone or in combination with colony-stimulating factors) is often initiated. Predictive models for response to
GF have been developed based on red blood cell (RBC)
transfusion needs and erythropoietin (epo) levels.13,14
Patients with low transfusion needs and low serum epo
levels (ie, <2 units RBC per month and an epo level
500 U/L) have a good chance (74%) of responding to
GF; patients with moderate transfusion needs and epo
levels (ie, <2 units RBC per month with an epo level
>500 U/L, or 2 units RBC per month with an epo level
500 U/L) have an intermediate chance (23%) of
responding to GF; and patients with high transfusion
needs and high epo levels (ie, 2 units RBC per month
and an epo level >500 U/L) have a poor chance (7%) of
responding to GF. There is no difference in survival
among good, intermediate, and poor GF predictive
groups.15 The optimal initial therapy (GF vs nongrowth
factor [NGF] therapies, including differentiation agents
and immunomodulatory drugs) in transfusion-dependent MDS patients based on response rates to NGF and
GF and on survival has not been defined.
Decision analysis has been used to answer similar therapeutic questions in other hematologic malignancies.16–18 It allows for testing multiple initial
conditions while incorporating standardized risk factors (such as IPSS score), response rates, survival,
and quality of life (QOL) data in outcomes. It is a
statistical tool that allows the user to play out certain
clinical scenarios, given already-established probabilities (such as the probability of responding to a drug
or probability of living 1 year), to guide clinical decisions in future patients. In MDS this statistical technique has influenced practice in determining the
optimal timing for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT).19 In that decision analysis, the probability of survival was calculated based on baseline IPSS

risk scores and the risk of death or the potential benefit of performing a BMT at diagnosis, various years after diagnosis, or at transformation to acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). The model concluded, for example,
that patients with high-risk MDS gained the greatest
survival by undergoing a BMT at diagnosis, rather
than waiting. We performed a decision analysis to
determine the most appropriate initial therapy for
low-risk MDS patients falling into good, intermediate,
or poor GF predictive groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were identified from a MEDLINE search on
the keywords ‘‘MDS’’, ‘‘RA’’, ‘‘RARS’’, ‘‘treatment’’, ‘‘GF,’’
and ‘‘chemo.’’ Original articles with individual patient
characteristics, pathologically confirmed RA or RARS
MDS subtypes, and documented effect of therapy
were included. From 1985 through 2005, 164 articles
representing 2604 patients with low-risk MDS were
reviewed (Fig. 1). Individual patient data, for precisely
quantifying expected outcomes, were available on 811
patients from 90 articles (grouped data cannot be
used in decision analyses). In studies that included
both low-risk and high-risk MDS patients, only data
on low-risk MDS patients (MDS with <5% bone marrow blasts) were used in this decision analysis. When
comparing baseline characteristics, response patterns,
and overall survival between individual patient data
and grouped patient data, no significant differences
were detected; thus, individual data were determined
to be a good representation of the grouped data.
Patients with available individual data were then divided into those treated with NGF therapies (n ¼ 405,
from 79 articles comprising 1005 patients) and those
treated with GF (n ¼ 394, from 85 articles comprising
1587 patients). Another 12 patients received placebo
and were not included in further analyses.
NGF therapies included differentiation agents,
immunomodulators, and nonablative cytotoxic agents

granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (single
therapy and combination studies). As interferon and
interleukin therapy can be considered either NGF or
GF therapies, patients treated with these agents were
first included as NGF subjects, and then as GF subjects, with no change in results. Thus, for the purposes of these analyses, they were grouped and
reported as NGF subjects. Patients receiving both single-agent GF and combined GF therapy were combined, as the 2 approaches yielded similar response
rates. The number of patients with available cytogenetics data, baseline erythropoietin levels, and baseline transfusion amount did not differ for GF and
NGF patients. IPSS scores were either recorded in a
publication, or calculated when sufficient data were
available, in 584 patients.

Statistical Methods and Decision Modeling
Responses were standardized and recalibrated (when
necessary) according to the IWG criteria and included complete response, partial response, and hematologic improvement.11,12 Median survival in GF
patients was derived from the Jadersten et al. study,15
and was validated with data from GF patients in our
database. Survival in GF and NGF patients was also
determined directly from the database and was available for 607 patients. T-tests were performed for continuous variables, and chi-square for categorical values,
comparing GF and NGF groups. Survival analysis was
performed by assuming, for each article, a constant
hazard for all patients.
Decision model
The primary decision examined in this study was to
define the optimal initial treatment strategy in
patients with low-risk MDS. Two possible strategies
were explored: 1) treating patients initially with GF,
and 2) treating patients initially with NGF therapies.
These 2 strategies were examined assuming 3 different initial states: i) patients were in the good GF predictive group, ii) patients were in the intermediate
GF predictive group, and iii) patients were in the
poor GF predictive group. Analyses were performed
using a decision-tree modeling approach. The final
outcomes of interest include the survival time in
years and the QOL-adjusted survival time expressed
as the quality adjusted life years (QALYs).

1127

A Markov decision model20 was designed after a
hypothetical cohort of patients transitioned among
predefined health states. Possible health states considered in this model included ‘‘alive’’ with or without response to treatment, and ‘‘death’’ with or
without response to treatment. The baseline starting
age of this cohort was 60 years. One month was used
as the transition cycle in the Markov model. The
monthly transitional probabilities were derived from
the median survival time in available publications.15,21 The death state was considered absorbing
by design, meaning no transitions occurred from this
state to others.
To perform the decision analysis, certain assumptions had to be made, based on best practice standards for MDS. Patients initially treated with NGF
continued on NGF therapies if they responded to the
treatment. Nonresponders remained on therapy for
only 2 months. Patients initially treated with GF continued on GF therapy if they responded to the treatment. Otherwise, an NGF treatment (including
chemotherapy) was used to replace the initial therapy after an average of 2 months of failed GF therapy. In these patients, a similar scenario of NGF
therapy was assumed for those who switched to NGF
therapy after failing the GF therapy (Fig. 2). The
response rates to NGF and GF therapies were derived
from our database (Table 1).
The monthly death probabilities were assumed
the same for patients who did not respond to NGF in
both comparison arms. They were also assumed to
be higher than the monthly death probabilities for
patients who responded to NGF or GF therapy, which
is clinically intuitive and supported by studies in
low-risk MDS patients.15,22,23 Sensitivity analysis
results were derived from the model for the cutpoint
where either decision of GF or NGF treatment is
indifferent.
There are limited data on QOL for MDS patients
in the literature receiving either GF or NGF
therapy.19,24,25 No utility measurements, the ideal
outcome measures for decision analysis and costeffectiveness analysis, were identified from the existing articles to assess the overall QOL in this population. Utilities are numerical values that range from
0–1.0 that represent the perceived value of a given
health state. For example, a value of 0 may represent
death, whereas 1.0 would represent perfect health.
The best available source uses a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
instrument and an overall QOL item administered to
patients receiving either 5-azacytidine (an NGF therapy) or best supportive care.26 This study accompanied the phase 3 registration trial of MDS patients

RESULTS
Patients
Patient characteristics are displayed in Table 2.
Patients receiving NGF therapies were younger, with
a median age of 65 years (range, 21–83 years), compared with 69 years (range, 19–81 years) for GF
patients (P < .05). The populations of GF and NGF
patients were similar with respect to gender, cytogenetics, baseline transfusion needs (median of 2 pRBC
transfusions per month [range, 0–8]), erythropoietin
levels, and FAB and IPSS classifications. The IPSS
score was 0–1.0 in 89.7% of the NGF patients and
91.2% of the GF patients. Patients receiving NGF
therapies had a response rate (RR) of 41.5%, compared with 46% for GF patients (P < .05) and were
more likely to have received prior therapies. Despite
this, survival in the 2 groups did not differ, even after
adjusting for age and baseline transfusion needs
(hazard ratio 2.25 favoring GF patients, P ¼ .14, Fig. 3).

Decision Model
Life expectancies for the 3 GF predictive groups and
the 2 treatment strategies are shown in Table 3. For
an average patient with an RR of 30% for NGF therapies, NGF will be a preferred treatment if s/he is in
the intermediate or poor GF predictive group. GF
will be a preferred treatment if s/he is in the good
GF predictive group. For a patient in the good GF
predictive group, his/her survival would be 3.38 years
for GF, versus 2.57 years for NGF. If the patient is in
the intermediate or poor GF predictive group, his/
her survival time for GF would decrease to 1.50 or
0.81 years, respectively, less than the 2.57 years for
NGF therapies. The preferred treatment strategy for
each GF predictive group did not change when using
NGF RRs that ranged from 20% to 50%. This range
included the 50% RR seen in patients treated with
anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A.
Using the decision model, with survival time as
the outcome of interest, the base case results showed

FIGURE 4. Algorithm for choice of initial therapy in low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients.
that patients in a good GF predictive group should
receive GF unless NGF therapies have a chance of
producing a response in 46% of patients (Fig. 4).
Patients in the intermediate GF predictive group
should receive NGF therapies if the therapies have a
chance of producing a response in >14% of patients.
Patients in the poor GF predictive group should
receive NGF therapies in almost all cases, as long as
the therapies have a chance of producing a response
in >4% of patients. These results did not vary appreciably when analyses were limited to the 584 patients
with an IPSS score, or the 90.5% of patients with an
IPSS score 1.0. Results were also identical for previously untreated patients.
Sensitivity analyses indicated that the RRs for GF
and NGF were the 2 most sensitive variables in the
model. The change of their values was likely to
change the final treatment choice between GF and
NGF, which was demonstrated in the results above.
Other variables, including risk of death, were not
sensitive enough to change treatment decision-making. As an example, for an average patient with an
RR of 30% for NGF, which is larger than the range
between 11.2% and 18.0% (25% of the threshold of
the intermediate GF predictive group), NGF would
still be the preferred treatment choice.
If QOL-adjusted survival time is the outcome of
interest, the preferred treatment strategy has almost

no change. Patients in a good GF predictive group
should receive GF unless NGF therapies have a
chance of producing a response in >46% of patients.
Patients in the intermediate GF predictive group
should receive NGF therapies if the therapies have a
chance of producing a response in >14% of patients.
Patients in the poor GF predictive group should
receive NGF therapies in almost all cases, as long as
the therapies have a chance of producing a response
in >4% of patients.
Quality-adjusted life expectancies echo nonquality-adjusted findings (Table 3). If a patient is in the
good GF predictive group, his/her QOL-adjusted survival time would be 1.94 QALYs for GF, vs 1.45 QALYs
for NGF. If the patient is in the intermediate or poor
GF predictive group, his/her QOL-adjusted survival
time for GF would decrease to 0.91 or 0.46 years,
respectively, less than the 1.45 QALYs for NGF.

DISCUSSION
Treatment decision-making in patients with low-risk
MDS used to be simple, when the standard of care
was considered to be supportive and patients either
responded to growth factors or relied on long-term
blood product transfusions. The past decade has
seen numerous clinical trials with NGF approaches
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ap-

proval of 3 drugs specifically for the treatment of
MDS. Due to the limited efficacy of GF, we are
experiencing a renaissance in disease-specific, targeted NGF therapies. With these newer classes of
drugs has come the need to define when their use
should supersede that of GF as initial therapy, particularly given their costs, variable response rates and
definitions of response, and limited survival data.
Our treatment algorithm suggests that low-risk
MDS patients falling into a good GF predictive group
(low RBC transfusion needs and low epo levels)
should initially be treated with GF unless NGF therapy response rates are 46%. Other low-risk MDS
patients, once they reach a point at which therapy is
being considered (frequently, once blood transfusions
are being initiated or the hemoglobin has dropped
below 9–10 g/dL), should probably be treated with
NGF therapies initially.
The advantage of performing a decision analysis
is that we were able to use a large amount of individual patient data from published trials of therapies for
low-risk MDS. In doing so, we standardized response
criteria and prognostic variables and pooled available
survival data to develop a systematic approach to this
patient population. We used an already-published predictive model for low-risk MDS patients because it is
useful clinically, and expanded it to use in patients
being considered for NGF therapies.
Naturally, the conclusions reached here apply to a
large database of patients, and application to an individual patient must take into account factors difficult
to assess in already-published data. For example, the
cost of NGF therapy may be prohibitive to a patient
with a high baseline erythropoietin level who is covered by Medicare for growth factor therapy received in
a clinic setting, but who does not also have prescription drug coverage. Nonetheless, all things being equal,
the results of this analysis suggest that this patient
should be treated initially with NGF therapy.
This study has several potential limitations. First,
there is a natural tendency toward a selection bias in
patients who have been enrolled in a clinical trial of
GF or NGF therapies, and 1 of the baseline characteristics reflects this: NGF patients were more likely to
have received prior therapy, and thus likely to have
had MDS for a longer period of time. Insufficient
data were available from studies to actually report
time since diagnosis for each cohort. However, this
cohort’s survival was no different from that of GF
patients when baseline variables were taken into
account, and the results and conclusions remained
unaltered when only untreated patients were
included in the analysis. The raw survival time was
also incorporated into the decision model to yield

1131

the results presented herein. The counterargument
would hold that patients enrolled onto clinical trials of
NGF therapies were actually healthier, and that GF
patients may have been deemed by their physicians to
be too ill to receive NGF therapies. Similar performance
statuses, when available, belie this claim, as do other
similar baseline characteristics, including IPSS scores.
Survival data, as well as certain other baseline
characteristics (such as cytogenetics and baseline
transfusion needs and erythropoietin levels), were not
available on all subjects. As these were not differentially absent in both GF and NGF groups, however,
their absence would tend to result in random misclassification bias, and a tendency toward the null hypothesis of no difference. This was not the case. Analyses
of the data including only patients with IPSS scores
and survival did not alter the conclusions.
Another potential source of bias is the assumptions we made regarding the transitional probabilities. We assume the transitional probabilities were
the same for patients who do not respond to NGF
and those who do not respond to both GF and NGF,
which might not be the case in reality. There are no
available data to suggest the difference, including no
clear-cut survival advantage to the use of GF or NGF
in MDS patients. Additionally, we made the assumption that NGF replaces GF after an average of 2
months of failed GF therapy. As neither GF nor NGF
therapies have been demonstrated to improve survival in low-risk MDS patients, building into the
model a ‘‘watch and wait’’ period before this transition would not have had an effect on the findings.
In conclusion, patients with low-risk MDS should
be classified according to GF predictive models of
response, with therapy tailored according to likelihood of responding to growth factors. Those who fall
into a good predictive group should almost always
receive GFs, unless NGF approaches yield a high
response rate, as might be the case with, for example, lenalidomide for MDS associated with a del(5q)
cytogenetic abnormality, where response rates (defined as transfusion independence) approaches twothirds.30,31 Those in intermediate and poor predictive
groups should almost always be treated initially with
NGF therapies. These recommendations should only
serve as a guide for treatment in the absence of randomized studies, with therapy tailored to the individual patient.
