Abstract
Biological responses to estrogens in normal and malignant tissues are mainly mediated by the estrogen
receptors ERa and ERb, which function as ligand-activated transcription factors. In addition, the G protein–
coupled receptor GPR30 (GPER) mediates estrogenic signaling in breast cancer cells and cancer-associated
ﬁbroblasts (CAF) that contribute to cancer progression. In this study, we evaluated the role elicited by GPER in the
estrogen-regulated expression and function of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ER-negative breast
cancer cells and CAF. We demonstrated that 17b-estradiol (E2) and the GPER-selective ligand G-1 triggered a
GPER/EGFR/ERK/c-fos signaling pathway that leads to increased VEGF via upregulation of HIF1a. In further
extending the mechanisms involved in E2-supported angiogenesis, we also showed that conditioned medium
from CAF treated with E2 and G-1 promoted human endothelial tube formation in a GPER-dependent manner. In
vivo, ligand-activated GPER was sufﬁcient to enhance tumor growth and the expression of HIF1a, VEGF, and the
endothelial marker CD34 in a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer. Our ﬁndings offer important new insights
into the ability of estrogenic GPER signaling to trigger HIF1a-dependent VEGF expression that supports
angiogenesis and progression in breast cancer. Cancer Res; 74(15); 4053–64. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy
in women in the United States and the leading cause of cancerrelated death in women worldwide (1). Although the molecular
mechanisms involved in breast tumor development remain to
be fully understood, it has been established that E2 triggers
stimulatory effects by binding to the estrogen receptor (ER)a
and ERb that regulate the expression of genes involved in cellcycle progression, cell migration, and survival (2, 3). In addition, the G protein–coupled receptor (GPR)30/GPER has been
shown to mediate estrogenic signaling in different normal and
malignant cell contexts, including breast cancer (3–7). In this
regard, the identiﬁcation of selective GPER agonists or antagonists (8–12) has allowed the evaluation of certain biological
responses elicited through GPER. Actually, GPER activates a
network of transduction pathways involving the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), the intracellular cyclic AMP
(cAMP), the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) cascade, and calcium mobilization (13–15). Moreover, the poten-

tial of GPER to mediate growth effects in diverse types of
tumors has been evidenced (6, 7) together with its involvement
in the estrogen responsiveness of ER-negative breast cancer
cells (16). In accordance with these ﬁndings, the expression of
GPER was associated with aggressive features and lower
survival rates in patients with endometrial and ovarian cancer
(17, 18), whereas GPER was negatively correlated with relapsefree survival and positively associated with the resistance to
tamoxifen treatment in breast tumors (19). Therefore, GPER
may be considered as a prognostic marker and a further player
involved to some extent in the failure of endocrine therapy in
estrogen-sensitive malignancies (20). In addition, the GPER/
EGFR signaling mediates the expression of cell-cycle regulatory
genes in cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAF) derived from
patients with breast tumor, suggesting that the action of
GPER may involve a functional interaction between these
main components of the tumor microenvironment and cancer
cells (21).
Tumor angiogenesis is a complex process initiated by paracrine signals occurring through tumor cells and the surrounding stroma (22). As the vascular endothelial growth factor-A
(VEGF-A, also referred to as VEGF) mainly drives cancer
progression upon hypoxic conditions (23), VEGF inhibitors
are currently used in different chemotherapeutic strategies
(24). Hence, great efforts are still addressed toward a deeper
understanding of the transduction mechanisms involved in the
expression and function of VEGF. In this regard, it should be
mentioned that ERa mediates the upregulation of VEGF by
17b-estradiol (E2) in estrogen-sensitive tumors (25, 26). In
addition, E2 induced through ERa the expression of hypoxia
inducible factor-1a (HIF1a), which is an acknowledged VEGF

regulator (27, 28). Nevertheless, it remains to be elucidated the
potential of E2 in stimulating VEGF expression and angiogenesis in cell contexts lacking ER expression.
On the basis of the aforementioned data and our previous
investigation showing that HIF1a/GPER signaling mediates
the induction of VEGF by hypoxia in different model systems
(29), in this study we have assessed the ability of ligandactivated GPER to regulate VEGF in ER-negative breast cancer
cells as well as in CAFs and breast tumor xenografts. Our
results provide novel insights into the ability of estrogens to
induce VEGF expression and angiogenesis through GPER,
hence extending the mechanisms through which estrogens
trigger breast cancer progression.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
17b-Estradiol (E2), b-estradiol 6-(O-carboxy-methyl)oxime:
BSA (E2-BSA), and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Srl. 1-[4-(-6-Bromobenzol[1,3]diodo-5-yl)3a,4,5,9btetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c-] quinolin8yl] ethanone
(G-1) and (3aS,4R,9bR)-4-(6-bromo-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)3a,4,5,9b-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolone (G-15) were obtained
from Tocris Bioscience. Tyrphostin AG1478 (AG) was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories. PD98059 (PD) was
obtained from Calbiochem. Human VEGF was purchased from
Peprotech. All compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) except E2 and OHT, which were solubilized in
ethanol, and VEGF and E2-BSA, which were solubilized,
respectively, in water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Before use, E2-BSA stock solution was mixed with dextran

was a kind gift from Dr. P. Soumitro (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA). The hypoxia responsive element (HRE)-mutated
VEGF promoter (pVEGF-mut) reporter gene was kindly provided by Dr. J. Cheng (Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of
Medicine, Shanghai, China). CAFs and SkBr3 cells (1  105)
were plated into 24-well dishes with 500 mL/well culture
medium containing 10% FBS and transfected for 24 hours
with control shRNA, shHIF1a, and shGPER. A mixture containing 0.5 mg of reporter plasmid and 10 ng of pRL-TK was then
transfected by using X-treme GENE 9 DNA Transfection
Reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). After 8 hours, cells were treated for 18 hours with E2
and G-1 in serum-free medium. Luciferase activity was measured with Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega) and normalized to
the internal transfection control provided by Renilla luciferase.
The normalized relative light unit values obtained from cells
treated with vehicle were set as 1-fold induction, upon which
the activity induced by treatments was calculated.
Gene expression studies
Total RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized by
reverse transcription as previously described (29). The expression of selected genes was quantiﬁed by real-time PCR using
Step One sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems Inc.).
Gene-speciﬁc primers were designed using Primer Express
version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems Inc.). For ERa, ERb,
c-fos, HIF1a, VEGF, and the ribosomal protein 18S, the primers
were: ERa Fwd: 50 -AGAGGGCATGGTGGAGATCTT-30 and Rev:
50 -CAAACTCCTCTCCCTGCAGATT-30 ; ERb Fwd: 50 -GACCACAAGCCCAAATGTGTT-30 and Rev: 50 -ACTGGCGATGGACCACTAAA-30 ; c-fos: Fwd: 50 -GAGCCCTTTGATGACTTCCT-30
and Rev: 50 -GAGCGGGCTGTCTCAGA-30 ; HIF1a Fwd: 50 -TGCATCTCCATCTTCTACCCAAGT-30 and Rev: 50 -CCGACTGTGAGTGCCACTGT-30 ; VEGF: Fwd: 50 -TGCAGATTATGCGGATCAAACC-30 and Rev: 50 -TGCATTCACATTTGTTGTGCTGTAG30 ; 18S Fwd: 50 -GGCGTCCCCCAACTTCTTA-30 and Rev: 50 GGGCATCACAGACCTGTTATT-30 . Assays were performed in
triplicate and the RNA expression values were normalized using
18S expression and then calculated as fold induction.

Cell cultures
CAFs obtained from breast malignancies were characterized
and maintained as we previously described (29). The SkBr3
breast cancer cells were obtained by ATCC, used less than 6
months after resuscitation, and maintained in RPMI-1640
without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 100 mg/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), kindly
provided by Dr. A. Caruso (University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy)
and routinely tested and authenticated according to the ATCC
suggestions, were seeded on collagen-coated ﬂasks (SigmaAldrich Srl) and cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM;
Lonza), supplemented with 5% FBS (Lonza). Breast MCF-7 and
prostate LNCaP cancer cells were obtained by ATCC, used less
than 6 months after resuscitation, and maintained respectively
in DMEM and RPMI-1640, both supplemented with 10% FBS
and 100 mg/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies).
Cells were switched to medium without serum 24 hours before
experiments.

Western blot analysis
SkBr3 cells, CAFs, and tumor homogenates obtained from
nude mice were processed according to a previous described
protocol (29). Protein lysates were electrophoresed through a
reducing SDS/10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto
a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with primary antibodies
against HIF1a (R&D Systems, Inc.), ERb (Serotec), ERa (F-10),
GPER (N-15), CD34 (ICO115), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4),
ERK2 (C-14), phosphorylated EGFR (Tyr 1173), EGFR (1005),
and b-actin (C2) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(DBA). Proteins were detected by horseradish peroxidase–linked
secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA) and
revealed using the ECL System (GE Healthcare).

vector, a speciﬁc shRNA sequence for each target gene, the
plasmid DN/c-fos encoding a c-fos mutant that heterodimerizes with c-fos dimerization partners but not allowing
DNA binding (kindly obtained from Dr. C. Vinson, NIH,
Bethesda, MD; ref. 30). The HIF1a shRNA and the respective
control plasmid were purchased from SABioscience Corporation. The silencing of GPER expression was obtained by a
construct previously described (31).
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
SkBr3 cells and CAFs were grown on coverslips, then serum
deprived and transfected for 24 hours with shHIF1a or shGPER
and the respective control plasmids. Thereafter, cells were
treated for 18 hours with E2 and G-1, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed 3 times
with PBS, and incubated overnight with a mouse primary
antibody against VEGF (C-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA).
After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS
and incubated with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich) and donkey
anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:300; purchased from Alexa Fluor; Life
Technologies). Leica AF6000 Advanced Fluorescence Imaging
System supported by quantiﬁcation and image processing
software Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence
(Leica Microsystems CMS) were used for the microscopy
evaluation.
Conditioned medium
CAFs were cultured in regular growth medium, then cells
were washed twice with PBS and transfected for 24 hours in
serum-free RPMI-1640 with shGPER or control shRNA using
X-treme GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were treated for 18 hours with E2 and G-1, the
culture medium was then replaced for additional 18 hours
with medium without serum and treatments. Thereafter, the
supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 5
minutes to remove cell debris, and used as conditioned
medium in HUVECs.
Evaluation of E2 production
SkBr3 and CAFs cultured in regular growth medium were
rinsed twice with PBS and incubated with serum-free medium
for 24 hours. Culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 5 minutes to remove cell debris. Three
hundred pg/mL of E2 were added to collected supernatants in
order to obtain a positive control. E2 production was measured
by ELISA (Enzo Life Sciences) in three independent experiments performed in triplicate.
Tube formation assay
The day before the experiment, HUVECs were cultured in
serum-free medium (EBM; Lonza). Growth factor–reduced
Matrigel (Cultrex; Trevigen Inc.) was thawed overnight at
4 C on ice, plated on the bottom of prechilled 96-well plates,
and left at 37 C for 1 hour for geliﬁcation. Starved HUVECs
were collected by enzymatic detachment (0.25% trypsin-

www.aacrjournals.org

EDTA solution; Life Technologies), counted, and resuspended in conditioned medium from CAFs. Then, 10,000
cells/well were seeded on Matrigel and incubated at 37 C.
Cord formation was observed 2 hours after cell seeding.
Tube formation was quantiﬁed by using the software NIH
ImageJ.
Proliferation assay
For quantitative proliferation assay, SkBr3 cells (1  105)
were seeded in 24-well plates in regular growth medium. Cells
were washed once they had attached and then incubated in
medium containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS with the indicated treatments; medium was renewed every 2 days (with
treatments) and cells were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter, as recommended by the manufacturer's
protocol (Life Technologies).
In vivo studies
Female 45-day-old athymic nude mice (nu/nu Swiss; Harlan
Laboratories) were maintained in a sterile environment. At day
0, exponentially growing SkBr3 cells (8.0  106 per mouse) were
inoculated subcutaneously in 0.1 mL of Matrigel (Cultrex;
Trevigen Inc.). When the tumors reached average 0.15 cm3
(i.e., in about 1 week), mice were randomized and divided into
four groups, according to treatments administered by intramuscular injection for 40 days. The ﬁrst group of mice (n ¼ 7)
was treated daily with 100 mL of vehicle (0.9% NaCl with 0.1%
albumin and 0.1% Tween-20; Sigma-Aldrich), the second
group of mice (n ¼ 7) was treated daily with 100 mL G-1
(0.5 mg/kg/die), the third group of mice (n ¼ 7) was treated
daily with 100 mL G-15 (3.5 mg/kg/die), and the fourth group of
mice (n ¼ 7) was treated daily with 100 mL G-1 in combination
with G-15 (at the concentrations described above). G-1 and G15 were dissolved in DMSO at 1 mg/mL. For treatments, 6.2 mL
of G-1 were added to 93.8 mL of vehicle and 44 mL G-15 were
added to 56 mL of vehicle. The doses of G-15 were chosen to
represent an approximately 1:7-fold mg excess with respect to
G-1. SkBr3 xenograft tumor growth was evaluated by caliper
measurements, along two orthogonal axes: length (L) and
width (W). Tumor volumes (in cm3) were estimated by the
following formula: TV ¼ L  (W2)/2. At day 40, the animals
were sacriﬁced following the standard protocols and tumors
were dissected from the neighboring connective tissue. Specimens of tumors were frozen in nitrogen and stored at 80 C,
the remaining tumor tissues of each sample were ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and embedded in parafﬁn for the histologic
analyses. Animal care, death, and experiments were done in
accordance with the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication
No. 85-23, revised 1996) and in accordance with the Italian law
(DL 116, January 27, 1992). The project was approved by the
local ethical committee.
Histologic analysis
Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded sections of tumor
xenografts were cut at 5 mm and allowed to air dry. Deparafﬁnized, rehydrated sections were stained for 6 minutes
with hematoxylin (Bio-Optica), washed in running tap water,

then dehydrated, cleared with xylene, and mounted with
resinous mounting medium. Morphologic analyses were
carried out on parafﬁn-embedded tumor sections, stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), or immunolabeled with
human cytocheratin 18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA).
Tumor sections were immunolabeled with CD34, which
served as a vessel marker (32, 33).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by
Newman–Keuls' testing to determine differences in means.
Statistical comparisons for in vivo studies were made using the
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
E2 and G-1 induce VEGF expression through GPER
Considering the ability of estrogens to stimulate the expression of the proangiogenic mediator VEGF (25, 26), we aimed to
evaluate whether GPER may be involved in this response to
estrogens. To this end, we used as a model system the SkBr3
breast cancer cells and CAFs that do not express the classical
ERs (Supplementary Fig. S1) and are not able to produce E2
following our experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig.
S1). As determined by real-time PCR, the selective GPER
agonist G-1 and E2 induced the mRNA expression of VEGF

4056

Cancer Res; 74(15) August 1, 2014

(Fig. 1A and B). Accordingly, G-1 and E2 transactivated a VEGF
promoter construct (Fig. 1C) through GPER, as the luciferase
activity was repressed knocking down the expression of GPER
in SkBr3 cells (Fig. 1D) and CAFs (data not shown). The
aforementioned ﬁndings were then conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescence experiments performed in both SkBr3 cells (Fig. 2)
and CAFs (Supplementary Fig. S2), further corroborating the
involvement of GPER in the upregulation of VEGF protein
expression induced by estrogens in these cells.

HIF1a expression is regulated by estrogens through
GPER along with the EGFR/ERK/c-FOS transduction
pathway
On the basis of previous data showing that estrogens
induce the expression of HIF1a, which has been largely
involved in the transcriptional regulation of VEGF (27,
28), we asked whether this action of estrogens may occur
through GPER. Notably, E2 and G-1 upregulated the mRNA
expression (Fig. 3A and B) and the protein levels of HIF1a
(Fig. 3C–F) in a GPER-dependent manner as the GPER
silencing abrogated these responses (Fig. 3G and H and
Supplementary Fig. S3). Next, the HIF1a protein increase
by E2 and G-1 was abrogated in presence of the EGFR
inhibitor AG1478 (AG), the MEK inhibitor PD, or using a
plasmid encoding a c-fos mutant named dominant/negative
c-fos (DN/c-fos) in both SkBr3 cells (Fig. 4A and B) and CAFs
(Fig. 4C and D). Taken together, these data indicate that

mediate the HIF1a expression induced by E2 and G-1.
HIF1a is involved in the upregulation of VEGF induced
by E2 and G-1
Considering that HIF1a exerts a crucial role in the regulation of VEGF in diverse pathophysiologic conditions, we aimed
to evaluate whether the VEGF protein induction by E2 and G-1
is mediated by HIF1a. Performing immunoﬂuorescence assays
we ascertained that the upregulation of VEGF induced by these
ligands is abrogated knocking down HIF1a expression in both
SkBr3 cells (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S3) and CAFs
(Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). Accordingly, the transactivation of a VEGF promoter construct triggered by E2 and G-1 was

mentary Fig. S5) and CAFs (data not shown). Likewise, the
luciferase activity induced by E2 and G-1 was prevented
transfecting cells with a HRE-mutated VEGF promoter construct (Supplementary Fig. S5). It is worth noting that E2 and G1 were also not able to stimulate VEGF expression transfecting
both SkBr3 cells and CAFs with the DN/c-fos plasmid (data not
shown).
Further supporting the aforementioned ﬁndings, in SkBr3
cells the membrane impermeable E2-BSA induced the EGFR
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S6) as well
as the upregulation of c-fos, HIF1a, and VEGF mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. S6). In addition, E2 and G-1 alone and
in the presence of the ER antagonist OHT promoted the
activation of EGFR and ERK1/2 (Supplementary Fig. S6) as
well as the upregulation of c-fos, HIF1a, and VEGF mRNA

expression (Supplementary Fig. S6). It is worth noting that
OHT stimulated the aforementioned responses (Supplementary Fig. S6) acting as a GPER agonist, according to previous
studies (4, 7). Altogether, these data may suggest that GPER
mediates the estrogen-induced expression of VEGF through
the EGFR/ERK/c-fos transduction pathway and the involvement of HIF1a.
GPER is involved in VEGF-mediated tube formation
induced by E2 and G-1
Having established that GPER mediates the estrogeninduced upregulation of VEGF, we analyzed the potential role
of GPER in endothelial tubulogenesis. HUVECs that represent a
useful model system for in vitro evaluation of neoangiogenesis
(34) were cultured using conditioned medium from CAFs
previously treated with E2 and G-1. Interestingly, a ramiﬁed

4058

Cancer Res; 74(15) August 1, 2014

network of tubules was generated in HUVECs grown in medium from CAFs treated with E2 and G-1 (Fig. 6A), whereas these
ligands had no effects knocking down the expression of GPER
in CAFs (Fig. 6B). Further supporting these data, the addition of
VEGF to medium collected from GPER-silenced CAFs rescued
the generation of tubule structures in HUVECs (Fig. 6C). These
results, recapitulated in Fig. 6D–F, indicate that VEGF may be
considered as a target of the estrogenic GPER signaling toward
new blood vessels formation.

Then, we turned to an in vivo model system. Female nude
mice bearing into the intrascapular region SkBr3 cell tumor

administrations were well tolerated as no change in body
weight or in food and water consumption was observed
together with no evidence of reduced motor function. In
addition, no signiﬁcant difference in the mean weights or
histologic features of the major organs (liver, lung, spleen, and
kidney) was observed after sacriﬁce among vehicle and
ligands-treated mice, thus indicating a lack of toxic effects.
Histologic examination of SkBr3 xenografts revealed that
tumors were primarily composed of tumor epithelial cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7). After 40 days of treatment, the tumor
growth induced by G-1 was prevented by G-15 (Fig. 7A).
Representative tumor images are shown in Fig. 7B. As

evidenced in Supplementary Fig. S6, E2 and G-1 stimulated
the proliferation of SkBr3 cells also in growth assays performed in vitro. Next, we found increased HIF1a and VEGF
protein levels in tumor homogenates obtained from G-1–
stimulated mice with respect to vehicle-treated mice; however, these stimulatory effects were abrogated in the animal
group receiving G-15 in addition to G-1 (Fig. 7C). The
acknowledged marker of endothelial cell proliferation CD34
(32, 33) paralleled the increased expression of HIF1a and
VEGF upon treatments (Fig. 7C and Supplementary Fig. S8),
suggesting that ligand-activated GPER may stimulate tumor
growth and angiogenesis.

Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated that GPER mediates the
upregulation of VEGF expression induced by E2 and G-1 in
breast cancer cells and CAFs. In particular, we have ascertained
that GPER activation by both ligands engages the EGFR/ERK/
c-fos transduction signaling toward the induction of HIF1a
and VEGF transcription. As a biological counterpart, we have
evidenced that GPER mediates endothelial tube formation in
HUVECs cultured in medium from CAFs, which were previously treated with E2 and G-1. In addition, we have determined
that G-1 induces growth effects in SkBr3 tumor xenografts and
increases the expression of HIF1a, VEGF, and CD34 in tumor
homogenates. Therefore, the present ﬁndings provide novel
insights into the potential of GPER to mediate estrogendependent regulation and function of VEGF, which plays a
main role in tumor angiogenesis and progression (23, 24).

Breast cancer is stimulated by estrogens that activating the
classical ERs modulate cell proliferation, adhesion, migration,
and invasion in estrogen-sensitive tumors (2, 3). In addition,
estrogens promote the formation of new blood vessels within
the tumor mass (35), hence suggesting that these steroids elicit
a stimulatory role not only in cancer cells but also in components of the surrounding stroma in accordance with the results
obtained in this study. As the complex process of angiogenesis
is required for tumor progression, it represents a central
biological target in cancer (36). VEGF is one of the most potent
proangiogenic factor playing a paramount role in the formation of blood vessels in the development of different types of
tumors, including breast cancer (23). Accordingly, VEGF is
highly expressed in breast cancer specimens compared with
normal breast tissue (37) and its suppression leads to the
inhibition of breast tumor development (38). Diverse factors

regulate VEGF expression like hypoxia, cytokines, growth
factors, and hormones (23). In this regard, previous studies
have demonstrated the ability of estrogens to upregulate VEGF
levels activating ERa, which binds to the estrogen response
elements (ERE) located within the VEGF promoter region (25,
26, 39). As these studies evaluated the mechanisms involved in
the estrogen-regulated VEGF expression in ER-positive cells, in

www.aacrjournals.org

this study we evaluated the potential of estrogens to trigger the
transcription of VEGF in ER-negative cells. In particular, using
both in vitro and in vivo model systems we have provided novel
evidence about the GPER-mediated stimulation of VEGF,
although further investigations are needed to better clarify
the role played by GPER in the modulation of VEGF in diverse
pathophysiologic conditions.

Interestingly, our data may recall previous ﬁndings showing
that the ER antagonist and GPER agonist OHT (4, 7) is able to
upregulate VEGF in different tumor types, including breast
cancer (40, 41). In addition, it has been recently reported that
low survival rates in patients with endometrial cancer are
associated with both elevated GPER expression and VEGF
levels (42), further providing a relationship between these 2
main players of tumor cells and the surrounding stroma.
HIF1a constitutes with HIF1b the active transcriptional
complex HIF1 that regulates many genes involved in important
biological functions in cancer cells like energy metabolism,
survival, cell migration, and neovascularization (43). Cytokines, growth factors, and hormones beyond hypoxia were
shown to upregulate the expression of HIF1a (44). For
instance, in normoxic conditions activated EGFR increased
HIF1a expression through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and
MAPK transduction pathways (45). Further extending these
data, our present results indicate that the GPER/EGFR/ERK/cfos transduction signaling is involved in the upregulation of
HIF1a by estrogens, thus providing novel insights into the
mechanisms mediating the HIF1a-dependent stimulation of

4062

VEGF. Moreover, the current results corroborate our previous
studies showing that a cross-talk between HIF1a and GPER
regulates the expression and function of VEGF upon hypoxic
conditions (29).
The stromal contribution to the development of a wide
variety of tumors has been extensively assessed using both in
vitro and in vivo model systems (46, 47). For instance, it has
been shown that malignant cells may recruit into the tumor
mass diverse components of the microenvironment like CAFs,
inﬂammatory and vascular cells that actively cooperate toward
cancer progression (46, 47). In particular, increasing evidence
has suggested that CAFs contribute to cancer aggressiveness
through the production of secreted factors that target numerous stromal components and cancer cell types (46–48). In
breast carcinomas, CAFs have been shown to elicit relevant
biological activities including the stimulation of new blood
vessels formation, which closely correlates with cancer growth,
metastasis, and poor prognosis (29, 46–48). Our results further
extend these ﬁndings as the medium collected from CAFs,
which were stimulated by estrogens, induced tube formation in
HUVECs. This response occurred through the GPER-mediated
release of VEGF, suggesting that the paracrine signaling
between CAFs and endothelial cells may trigger angiogenic
processes toward tumor progression. Likewise, the growth
effects observed in breast cancer xenografts upon ligandactivated GPER were paralleled in tumor homogenates by an
increased expression of HIF1a, VEGF, and the vessel marker
CD34. In line with these data, an enhanced tumor growth
occurred in vivo using breast cancer cells engineered to express
elevated levels of VEGF (49), on the contrary the inhibition of
VEGF led to the growth arrest of breast carcinomas in nude
mice (38). In addition, an increased VEGF expression upon E2
exposure was found in rat mammary cancer (50), further
highlighting the main role played by VEGF in breast
tumorigenesis.
The present data provide novel insights into the potential of
estrogenic GPER signaling to trigger the HIF1-mediated
increase of VEGF toward angiogenesis and cancer progression.
Furthermore, the paracrine responses mediated by GPER
extend the current knowledge on the critical interaction
between cancer cells and the surrounding stroma, which plays
a pivotal role in tumor development and metastasis. Altogether, these ﬁndings may be taken into account in setting novel
therapeutic strategies targeting the stimulatory action of
estrogens in breast cancer.
