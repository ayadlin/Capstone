ABSTRACT
Autophagy is a tightly regulated catabolic process that leads to the degradation
of cytoplasmatic components such as aggregated/misfolded proteins and organelles
through the lysosomal machinery. Recent studies suggest that autophagy plays such
a role in the context of the anti-tumor immune response, make it an attractive target
for cancer immunotherapy. Defective autophagy in hematopoietic stem cells may
contribute to the development of hematologic malignancies, including leukemia,
myelodysplastic syndrome, and lymphoproliferative disorder. In blood cancer cells,
autophagy can either result in chemoresistance or induce autophagic cell death that
may act as immunogenic. Based on the successful experimental findings in vitro and in
vivo, clinical trials of autophagy inhibitor such as hydroxychloroquine in combination
with chemotherapy in patients with blood cancers are currently underway. However,
autophagy inactivation might impair autophagy-triggered anticancer immunity,
whereas induction of autophagy might become an effective immunotherapy. These
aspects are discussed in this review together with a brief introduction to the
autophagic molecular machinery and its roles in hematologic malignancies.

condition of stimulation of autophagy, the type I PI3KAKT-mTOR signaling is inhibited and type III PI3K
mammalian vps34/Beclin-1 (Atg6) is activated. Inhibition
of mTOR reassociates dephosphorylated Atg13 with
Atg1, which in turn results in redistribution of mAtg9
from trans-Golgi to late endosome and induces autophagy
[9, 10]. Simultaneously, the activation of vps34/Beclin-1
generates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) P3 (PIP3) on
endomembrane, resulting in isolation and decoration with
Atg5 and Atg16 of a small template membrane, which
designated as phagophore [11]. (ii) vesicle expansion and
completion: the structure of phagophore could not get
further progression without two ubiquitin-like conjugation
systems. One pathway involves the covalent conjugation of
Atg12 to Atg5, with the help of Atg7 (E1-like enzyme) and
Atg10 (E2-like enzyme). Atg12-Atg5 successionally binds
to Atg16 and multi-dimerizes to form a large complex
[12–14]. The second pathway involves the conjugation of
phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) to microtubule-associated
protein1 light chain LC3 (homologue of mammalian Atg8)
by the sequential action of Atg4, Atg7 and Atg3. Briefly,
LC3 is cleaved by Atg4 to produce the cytosolic form
LC3-I (non-lipidated, 18KD), which is activated by Atg7

INTRODUCTION
Cell homeostasis is dependent on the balance
between biosynthesis and catabolism of macromolecules.
Eukaryotic cells possess two major protein degradation
routes: the ubiquitin-proteasome and the lysosomal
systems [1]. The proteasome system is responsible for
the selective degradation of most short-lived proteins [2],
while the lysosomal system degrades and recycles longlived proteins and defective organelles, these substances
from both inside and outside of cell are delivered to the
lytic compartments [2, 3]. There are four major pathways
to the lysosome for degradation: endocytosis/phagocytosis,
microautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA),
and macroautophagy [4, 5]. Degradation of exogenous
materials and membrane proteins is mediated by
the process of endocytosis/phagocytosis, whereas
degradation of cytoplasmic component is carried out by
microautophagy, CAM and macroautophagy [6].
Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as
“autophagy”) is the main form of autophagy, which
is a multi-step process involving at least four stages
[7, 8]: (i) autophagy induction: when cells were under the

and transferred to Atg3, then modified into autophagicvesicle-associated form LC3-II (PE-conjugated, 16KD),
used as a marker of autophagy [14, 15]. (iii) maturation
and fusion: autophagosomes undergo maturation
(including the encapsulation of cellular components), and
then fuse with lysosomes to become autolysosomes. (iv)
degradation: in the autolysosomes, engulfed components
are eventually degraded by lysosomal enzymes (Figure 1).
Autophagy is involved in various aspects of
biological processes, including cell survival/death,
proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and carcinogenesis
[16, 17]. The role of autophagy in cancer is controversial.
The degradation mechanism enables cells to recycle
cytoplasmic constituents and restore metabolic homeostasis,
maintaining cells survival under harsh conditions. However,
excessive autophagy also induces a non-apoptotic form of
programmed cell death, termed as type II programmed
cell death [18]. Not surprisingly, aberrant regulation of
autophagy is associated with many diseases such as cancer,
neurodegenerative disorders, myopathies, cardiovascular
diseases and so on. Recently, a series of studies reveal a
crucial role of autophagy pathway and its interacting
proteins in the regulation of immune response. This
review article will focus on autophagy-associated adaptive
immune responses and its role in hematologic malignancies
because a deeper understanding of the effects of autophagy
on immune and autophagy-associated adaptive immune
responses allow us to explore potential immunotherapeutic
approaches to cure hematologic malignancies.

It is well known that autophagy is regulated by
many signaling pathways (Figure 2). The PI3K- AMPKmTOR signaling pathways play a central role in the
regulation of autophagy [19, 20]. Among them, class I
PI3Ks phosphorylatePI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2, which bind to
the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT and its activator
3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), as a result, activation of AKT attenuates autophagy
[21–24]. Conversely, a dominant negative form of AKT
enhances autophagy. AKT-PDK-1 signaling pathway
activates a series of downstream signals, including
mTOR that has been considered as a “gate keeper” of the
autophagic pathway for it is a sensor for amino acids and
ATP, two metabolites known to regulate autophagy [20,
25, 26]. In contrast to class I PI3Ks, the class III PI3Ks
stimulate autophagy, which phosphorylate PI to generate
PIP3 and participate in sequestration of cytoplasmic
material in autophagic vacuoles [27]. An integral protein
in the class III PI3Ks pathway is Beclin-1, a mammalian
ortholog of yeast Atg6/Vps30, which is required for
autophagosome formation. Knockdown or antisense
Beclin-1 inhibits autophagy [28, 29]. The AMP-dependent
protein kinase (AMPK) is activated during hypoxia,
metabolic stress or ATP consumption by increased
ratios of AMP to ATP and stimulates autophagy through
inhibiting mTOR pathway [30, 31].

Figure 1: Schematic model of autophagy process. Autophagy is a multi-step process involving at least four main phases, which

is controlled by more than 30 autophagy-related (Atg) proteins and mediated by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, Atg12-Atg5 and
Atg8/LC3: including the initiation, vesicle expansion and completion, maturation and fusion, and ultimate degradation of the membrane
and its contents within the lysosomes.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response
can induce autophagy through the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4
and IRE1-ASK1-JNK1 pathways [32, 33]. The hyperexpression of death-associated protein kinase (DAPK)
and DAPK related protein kinase (DRP-1) trigger cell
membrane blebbing and extend autophagy continually [34].
DNA damage promotes autophagy through p53 signal [35].
Raf/MEK/ERK pathways stimulate autophagy in amino
acid depletion condition [36]. Hypoxia irritates autophagy
by up-regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1(HIF-1)
[37]. Together, these signaling pathways not only control
autophagy but also are involved in cancerogenesis, and
modulation of autophagy by targeting these pathways may
affect autophagy-associated adaptive immune responses.

as an instrument to detect invading pathogens or monitor
transforms in the status of self [38, 39]. Specific roles
of autophagy in innate immunity, which is regulated by
pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) signaling, include
the regulation of the inflammasome and the clearance
of apoptotic corpses to prevent either insufficient
inflammatory or excessive inflammatory responses
[17, 39]. In adaptive immunity, autophagy is essential
to antigen presentation, thymus selection, lymphocyte
development and homeostasis, which participates in anticancer effects. In this part, we therefore summarize current
understanding of roles of autophagy in adaptive immune
regulation.

Autophagy in antigen presentation

AUTOPHAGY AFFECTS ADAPTIVE
IMMUNITY

T cells recognize intra- and extra-cellular antigen
peptides that are presented to on major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) molecules at cell surface, which is crucial
for activation of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, respectively. In
generally, MHC-I molecules present antigenic peptides
derived from intracellular proteins. For this purpose,

Recent accumulating evidences have shown that
autophagy is also related to regulation of innate and
adaptive immunity. Immune system utilized autophagy

multiple stress situations during cancer progression, including amino acid depletion, hyper-expression of death-associated protein kinase,
DNA damage, energy depletion, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, hypoxia and other diverse stresses. The key signaling molecules are
the PI3K-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways, which determinate the levels of autophagy in cancer. Other autophagy-associated signaling

MHC-I molecules are loaded mainly with proteasomal
products for their recognition by CD8+ T cells, while
MHC-II molecules receive antigenic peptides from
extracellular antigens processed via lysosomal degradation
for their recognition by CD4+ T cells [40]. However, there
is an unconventional pathway named “cross-presentation”,
which allows dendritic cells (DCs) to present extracellular
antigenic peptides after lysosomal degradation through
MHC-I molecules [41, 42]. Similarly, intracellular
peptides can be loaded onto MHC-II molecules [43].

autophagy-inducing gene) siRNA inhibited recognition
by EBNA-1-specific CD4+T cells [51]. However, there
is a limited CD4 epitope display from endogenously
expressed EBNA1 because autophagy is predominantly a
cytoplasmic process [52].
Together, these reports suggest the important role
of autophagy in intracellular antigen processing for MHC
class II presentation to CD4+ T specific cells (Figure 3A).

Extracellular antigen processing for MHC class
II presentation by autophagy

Intracellular antigen processing for MHC class
II presentation by autophagy

Autophagy also plays an important role in
facilitating the recognition of extracellular antigens
phagocytesed by APCs in which antigens are delivered
to autophagosomes [45, 53, 54]. For example, Atg5 and
other proteins required for autophagy were demonstrated
to be essential for optimal processing and presentation of
a variety of forms of phagocytesed antigens containing
Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists [55]. It was reported
that targeting of the Influenza Matrix Protein 1 (MP1) to
autophagosomes via fusion to the Atg8/LC3 resulted in
an enhanced MHC-II presentation to CD4+ T cells [44].
However, a more recent study showed that autophagy
induced by influenza A virus failed to contribute to MHCII-restricted presentation [56]. In addition to viral and
bacterial antigen delivery for MHC II presentation after
autophagy, another role for this catabolic process in tumor
antigen delivery was recently suggested. Autophagic cargo
that can be extruded into the extracellular matrix from
cancer cells should be superior sources from which DCs
can intake antigen for T cell priming [57].
Autophagy machinery contributes to deliver
phagosomes to lysosomes for extracellular antigen
processing [58]. However, the exact mechanisms of this
process remain elusive. There are two hypotheses that
have been put forward to explain enhanced phagosome
processing with the help of autophagy: One is Atg8/
LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), which recruited
to phagosome membrane for strengthened fusion with
lysosomes. And the other one is amphisomes formation,
the procedure prior to lysosome fusion. Phagocytosis,
a prominent endocytic pathway, has been found to be
regulated by Atg proteins. During this LAP, LC3 seemed
to be transiently recruited to a subset of phagosome
membrane, which surrounded by pathogen-associated
molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors, including the TLR
family, primarily TLR2, or the C-type lectin Dectin-1,
the T-cell immunoglobulin mucin protein 4 (TIM4) or Fc
receptors for immunoglobulins, thus enhances phagosome
fusing with lysosomes [58–60]. The generation of ROS
produced by NADPH oxidases (NOX2) at the phagosome
was proposed to be needed to maintain the conjugation
of LC3 to phagosomes in LAP [61]. The fate of these
phagosomes depends on cellular background. In some cell
types, primarily mouse macrophages, the contents of LAP

Autophagy can deliver cytoplasmic constituents
for lysosomal hydrolysis, which contributes to the
processing of intracellular antigens for presentation by
MHC-II molecules. Some previous studies revealed that
equal to 20% of natural MHC class II ligands are derived
from cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Subsequent studies
demonstrated that antigens including viral antigens, selfproteins and tumor antigens can be presented on MHC-II
molecules [44, 45]. Biosynthesized, intracellular antigens
presented by MHC-II also documented in B cells and
fibroblasts. Brazil et al. demonstrated that presentation
of endogenous C5 protein (a component of complement)
by macrophage could be achieved when the macrophage
were treated with low doses of the lysosome tropic
agent ammonium choride, whereas in the presence of
an inhibitor of autophagy presentation of biosynthesized
C5 was inhibited [46]. In another in vitro experiment,
the agents specifically blocking autophagy (3-MA and
wortmannin) had been shown to reduce the capacity of
DCs to present MHC-II-restricted peptide derived from
endogenously synthesized mucin 1 protein(MUC1)
[47]. Because MUC1 is a heterodimeric protein that is
aberrantly expressed in various cancer cells including
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and AML stem
cells [48, 49], it is likely that autophagy induced by
chemotherapic drugs and small molecular inhibitors
in AML enhances the loading of MUC1 onto MHC
molecules. Presentation by MHC molecules of peptides
that suffer post-translational modifications and may form
neo-antigens is a key mechanism for the activation of T
cells. Autophagy in antigen presenting cells (APCs) has
been demonstrated to result in presentation of citrullinated
peptides to CD4+ T cells, which can be reduced by either
3-MA or ATG5 siRNA [50].
In addition to self-proteins, pathogen derived
antigens including some viral and bacterial antigens
that escape after endocytosis or release into the cytosol
could also get processed via autophagy for MHC class
II presentation. For example, Epstein Barr virus nuclear
antigen 1(EBNA1) was found in autophagosomes, which
could be presented to CD4+ T cells by EBV transformed
B cells via MHC class II pathway, and Atg12 (an essential

phagosomes seem to be degraded more rapidly than LC3
negative phagosomes, possibly because of more efficient
transport along microtubules through LC3 binding to
FYVE and coiled-coil domain containing 1 (FYCO1)
protein, which accelerates LAP phagosomes fusing with
lysosomes [62, 63]. Whereas, in plasmacytoid dendritic
cells (pDCs) and human macrophages, LAP vesicles seem
to be stabilized for fusion with TLR-containing endosomes
and postponed the presentation of extracellular antigens
for MHC class II [61]. Thus, the autophagy machinery
that mediates LAP can affect the fate of phagosomes and
facilitate the presentation of exogenous antigens by MHC
class II (Figure 3B).
Amphisomes have been characterized and defined
as an intermediate organelles, formed during autophagy
through the fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes.
Complex multi-vesicular vacuoles, an amphisomelike structure, have been observed in various cell types
[64, 65]. But, whether amphisomeis an alternative for

phagosomes fusion with autophagosomes for more
efficient delivery of endocytosed cargo, or just a tentative
structure with no biological effects is still enigmatic.

Antigen packaging for cross-presentation via
autophagy
Limited evidence displays that autophagy plays
a role in the conventional MHC class I presentation,
however, autophagy machinery has been implicated in
the presentation of extracellular, endocytosed antigens
by MHC class I molecules, a pathway termed crosspresentation that plays a critical role in cytotoxic T cell
immunity against viruses and tumors. The autophagic
exocytosis of antigen donor cell might benefit antigen
processing and had been shown to facilitate the crosspresentation of tumor and viral antigens [66, 67]. Li,
et al. demonstrated that autophagy in melanoma cells or
ovalbumin antigen-expressing human HEK 293T cells

for cross-presentation on MHC class I molecules in the donor cell. Both viral and tumor antigens benefit from the cross-presentation via

machinery for cross-presentation.

is essential for cross-presentation by DCs both in vitro
and in vivo [66]. Inhibition of autophagy by the RNAinterference (RNAi)-mediated depletion of Atg12 or
Beclin-1abolished cross-presentation almost completely,
whereas induction of autophagy by rapamycin or
starvation dramatically enhanced cross-presentation
of tumor antigens [66]. Recently, a working model has
been established to explain antigen accumulation inside
autophagosomes: when both proteasomes and lysosomes
are inhibited, short-lived proteins, defective ribosomal
products, likely component of the antigen pool in tumor
cells, and misfolded proteins accumulate and form
protein aggregates. This process then induces autophagy
via p62 and Atg8/LC3 interaction [68]. Of note, further
studies on mechanism of cross-presentation and
therapeutic efficacy showed potent anti-tumor efficacy
of the autophagosome-based DRibble (DRiPs-containing
blebs) vaccine [69, 70].
But how do autophagosomes and their contents leave
cells for cross-presentation is difficult to envision. One
most possibility might be dependent on unconventional
secretion of proteins, briefly, autophagosomes fuse
with late endosomes to generate multi-vesicular bodies
(MVBs), which could release exosomes, an immunogenic
vesicles [69, 70]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate
that autophagy could facilitate exosomes release, and then
antigens can be secreted by an unconventional pathway
from MVBs that receive input from autophagosomes.
Thus, autophagy might facilitate the packaging of antigens
efficiently for cross-presentation on MHC I molecules
(Figure 3C).

cells during infection with virus [78]. Furthermore, another
role for autophagy in inducible natural killer T (iNKT)
cells development has been displayed. The early stage of
iNKT development is retarded in mice with deficiency of
vps34/Beclin-1 [79]. Interestingly, autophagy has recently
been found to modulate energy metabolism in T cells.
With autophagy inhibitors treatment, ATP production
might not be normally increased accompanying with the
T cells activation, and ultimately, exhibit some defective
in T cells, which could be reversed by exogenous energy
source [80]. Thus, autophagy might be required for T-cell
homeostasis and function, though much remains to be
explored (Figure 4A).

AUTOPHAGY IN THE DEVELOPMENT
AND FUNCTION OF B CELLS
Current data from multiple studies have showed
that autophagy plays a complex role in the development
and function of B cells. Studies of Atg5 deficient
mice revealed a key role for autophagy in B cell
development and maintenance [81]. The quantity of B
cells compromised when genes encoding essential Atg
proteins are deficient, the decrease seems to originate
from autophagy-deficient B-cell progenitors’ failure of
transition between pro- and pre-B-cell stages in the bone
marrow, suggesting autophagy is required for B cells
development (Figure 4A).
The terminal step of the humoral immune
response is attributed to plasma cells generate antibodies
continuously. Besides, memory B cells can also be
reactivated for antibody production upon encountering
cognate antigen. Autophagy gene is essential for
plasma cell homeostasis and the survival of memory
B cells [82]. With the use of mice with B-cell-specific
deletion of Atg5, Miller’s group testified that plasma cell
differentiation initiated by T cell-dependent/-independent
antibody responses required autophagy [81]. Moreover,
the long-term survival of plasma cells in the bone
marrow are diminished in these autophagy deficient mice
[83]. The absence of autophagy in plasma cells had a
larger ER and more ER stress signaling than did their
wild-type counterparts, which led to higher expression
of the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1 and triggered
unfolded protein responses during the production of
immunoglobulins. The uncontrolled stress response
was associated with less intracellular ATP and induced
plasma cell death [84]. In addition to the maintenance of
plasma cells, autophagy is also required for the survival
of memory B cells. Mice with autophagy deficient B
cells have deadly impaired specific secondary antibody
responses to influenza A virus due to compromised
maintenance of memory B cells [85].
Taken together, autophagy functions as an important
role in B cells development, memory B cells survival and
plasma cells homeostasis.

AUTOPHAGY AND T CELL
HOMEOSTASIS
In addition to antigen processing, autophagy
modifies adaptive immunity via its contribution to
the development, repertoire selection, maturation,
homeostasis and effector functions of CD4+ / CD8+ T
cells. Basal autophagy maintains homeostasis in T cells
and can be up-regulated following T cell receptor (TCR)
stimulation, and the absence of autophagy causes T cells
differentiation abnormalities and function deficiency [71,
72]. Autophagy-associated presentation plays a crucial
role in positive and negative selection of naïve T cells.
When autophagy is abrogated, the number of naïve T cells
drastically decreased [73–75]. Similarly, autophagy is also
essential for mature T cell homeostasis and maintaining
periphery T cell survival during proliferation, which
entails clearance of damaged mitochondria and sustains
proper Ca2+ homeostasis by trimming the ER [72–76]. The
lack of autophagy results in increasing CD4+ T cell death,
because of increased ROS production, elevated amounts of
p38 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase), and imbalance of
pro- and pre-apoptotic protein [77]. Moreover, deficiency
in autophagy causes impaired survival of memory CD8+ T

cancer initiation and progression, which facilitates or even
triggers tumorigenesis (Figure 4B).
On the other hand, when tumor is established,
autophagy is able function as a pro-survival pathway.
Indeed, cancer cells utilize autophagy as a means to adapt
to the hypoxic, nutrient and growth factor deprivation,
and metabolically stressful tumor microenvironment
and therapeutically induced cell stress or damage [93].
Pharmacologic such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug administration for
clinical use [94] or genetic inhibition of autophagy restores
chemosensitivity and enhances tumor cell apoptosis in
many types of hematopoietic malignancies [95]. However,
autophagy also represents a distinct mechanism of cell death
(autophagic cell death, ACD) in well-defined circumstances.
For example, arsenic trioxide was showed to induce ACD
in leukemic cell lines and AML progenitors, which could be
reversed by knockdown of Beclin-1 or Atg7 [96]. We have
reported that overexpression of Beclin-1 delivered by an
oncolytic virus could induce significant ACD in a variety of
leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic blasts [97]. ACD
induced by anticancer agents in blood cancers has been
summarized in an excellent review [95].

Autophagy activity has been shown to be
constitutively high in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), and
is required for the differentiation and self-renewal of HSCs
[86–88]. It is well known that mechanisms protecting HSCs
from cellular damage are essential to prevent hematopoietic
malignancies. Autophagy is activated in response to various
cellular stresses including DNA damage and genomic
instability, removing unnecessary or harmful substances
via lysosomal degradation mechinery [89, 90]. Several lines
of evidence have shown that lack of autophagy in HSCs
is involved in the pathogenesis of blood cancers [91, 92].
Beclin-1 haploinsufficiency contributes to the development
of lymphoma and lymphoproliferative disease [91], whereas
impairment of autophagy caused by Atg7 deletion leads
to the expansion of progenitor cells in the bone marrow
giving rise to a severe, invasive myeloproliferation [92].
Collectively, autophagy deficiencies impair HSCs, and
cause oxidative stress, activation of the DNA damage
response and genome instability, a known cause of blood

Figure 4: The roles of autophagy in immune homeostasis and tumorigenesis. A. The normal state of autophagy regulation

mechanism is crucial for immune homeostasis. Autophagy plays a crucial role in positive and negative selection of naïve T cells and
is essential for mature T cell homeostasis and maintaining periphery T cell survival during proliferation. Autophagy also affects selfrenewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), B1a cell development, memory B cell maintenance, plasma cell survival, and IgG-balanced
secretion. B. The abrogation of autophagy leads to immune homeostasis imbalance, HSCs self-renewal impeded, cells are more sensitive
to various stresses, eventually resulting in the initiation and progression of blood cancers including leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome,
and lymphoproliferative disorder.

Recently, a deeper understanding of the process of
immunogenic cell death (ICD) that can elicit a protective
immune response against dead-tumor cell antigens
induced by ICD inducers such as anticancer cytotoxic
drugs and small molecular inhibitors has highlighted the
importance of cancer immunotherapies and proposed
novel antitumor strategies [98, 99]. There is increasing
evidence to suggest some chemotherapeutic agents
are intrinsically endowed with ability to trigger ICD
(Table 1). These cytotoxic anticancer drugs are employed
in the clinic for the treatment of hematologic malignancies,
including various anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin,

[99–101]. In AML cells, cytarabine, daunorubicin, alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) and valproic acid were also
found to induce increased calreticulin exposure (ecto-CRT)
and release of HSP70 and HSP90, which indicating an
induction of immunogenic apoptosis, although the level of
CRT exposure/HSP release seems to depend on individual
patients characteristics rather than the apoptosis-inducing
drug [102]. Bortezomib had been showed to induce
immunogenic death of human multiple myeloma, including
primary tumor cells, which is dependent on cell-cell contact
and linked to the expression of Hsp90 on the surface of
dying cells [103]. More recently, diverse pro-apoptotic
drugs, including topoisomerase II inhibitors, kinase
inhibitors, and proteosome inhibitors have been shown to
activate pannexin-1 channels and ATP release in Jurkat T
cell acute lymphocytic leukemia model, which mediate
immunogenic anti-tumor responses [104]. It is important to
note that these anticancer agents could induce autophagy in
both solid tumors and blood cancers (Table 1), thereby the
relationship between autophagy in response to the cytotoxic
agents and ICD in blood cancers deserve further attention.
A detailed discussion of the molecular and cellular
mechanisms involved in chemotherapy induced ICD
can be found in Ref [100, 105]. Briefly, ICD is preceded
or accompanied by the emission by dying cancer cells of
immunostimulatory molecules called damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs that are crucial
for ICD consist of ATP, high-mobility group protein B1
(HMGB1), and exposed molecules on the outer membrane
of dying cells such as calreticulin, heat-shock proteins
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Hsp90 and Hsp70), and ER sessile proteins. Mounting
evidence indicates that autophagy plays a critical role
in the induction of ICD. Michaud et al [106]. reported
that the process of autophagy is necessary for the antitumor immune response evoked by apoptotic tumor
cells in response to chemotherapy by regulation of ATP
release. HMGB1, a key DAMP factor, serve as powerful
immunological adjuvants and mediates ICD in cancer
therapy [107]. Autophagy regulates passive HMGB1
release from dying cells and active HMGB1 secretion [105,
108]. Additionally, ACD in cancer cells exhibits an ICD
property, especially in the ICD induced by some cytotoxic
agents (anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, and oxaliplatin),
vorinostat and bortezomib [99]. However, there is a few
studies suggest that autophagic response of melanoma cells
to ER stress suppresses basal ecto-CRT and restrains ICD
induced by photodynamic therapy, suggesting that the role
of autophagy in ICD needs to be assessed in context with
the cancer model and the type of ICD inducer [109, 110].

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
Autophagy, as an evolutionarily conserved catabolic
process, has been implicated in regulation of various
aspects of biological process, including cell survival/
death, proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and
carcinogenesis. Current evidence suggests an important
role for autophagy in both innate and adaptive immunity.
In fact, autophagy is widely involved in antigen
processing, and presentation, or function of antigen
donor cells, APCs and T cells. Furthermore, premortem
autophagy has been to determine the immunogenicity of
chemotherapy-induced cancer cell death via promoting
release of ATP. Like apoptotic cell death, autophagic
cell death also entails immunogenicity after anticancer
treatments. As autophagy plays multiple roles in antitumor
immune, it is a potential target for therapies in cancer
including hematologic malignancy.
Dysregulation of autophagy in HSCs is linked to
the initiation and progression of blood cancers including
leukemia [111], myelodysplastic syndrome [112], and
lymphoproliferative disorder [113]. In blood cancer
cells, autophagy is also a double-edged sword. Recently,
many clinical trials using autophagy inhibitor, such as
chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine, are

being applied to multiple blood cancer types, including
acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia and
multiple myeloma, in combination with chemotherapies
or target therapies (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02631252;
NCT01227135; NCT01689987 and NCT00568880).
However, an interesting unresolved is whether systemic
autophagy inactivation will be sufficiently selective to
kill cancer cells while sparing immune cells from the
deleterious consequences. Although autophagy-triggered
modulation of anticancer immune response is a very
complicated process, we need to elucidate some aspects
of antitumor immunity in the patients with hematologic
malignancy when autophagy inhibitor is administered.
