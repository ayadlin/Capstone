Abstract
Myeloid Translocation Gene, Related-1 (MTGR1) CBFA2T2 is a member of the Myeloid Translocation Gene
(MTG) family of transcriptional corepressors. The remaining two family members, MTG8 (RUNX1T1) and
MTG16 (CBFA2T3) are identified as targets of chromosomal translocations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Mtgr1/ mice have defects in intestinal lineage allocation and wound healing. Moreover, these mice show signs
of impaired intestinal stem cell function. Based on these phenotypes, we hypothesized that MTGR1 may
influence tumorigenesis arising in an inflammatory background. We report that Mtgr1/ mice were protected
from tumorigenesis when injected with azoxymethane (AOM) and then subjected to repeated cycles of dextran
sodium sulfate (DSS). Tumor cell proliferation was comparable, but Mtgr1/ tumors had significantly higher
apoptosis rates. These phenotypes were dependent on epithelial injury, the resultant inflammation, or a
combination of both as there was no difference in aberrant crypt foci (ACF) or tumor burden when animals were
treated with AOM as the sole agent. Gene expression analysis indicated that Mtgr1/ tumors had significant
upregulation of inflammatory networks, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for immune cell subsets revealed a
marked multilineage increase in infiltrates, consisting predominately of CD3þ and natural killer T (NKT) cells as
well as macrophages. Transplantation of wild type (WT) bone marrow into Mtgr1/ mice, and the reciprocal
transplant, did not alter the phenotype, ruling out an MTGR1 hematopoietic cell-autonomous mechanism. Our
findings indicate that MTGR1 is required for efficient inflammatory carcinogenesis in this model, and implicate
its dysfunction in colitis-associated carcinoma. This represents the first report functionally linking MTGR1 to
intestinal tumorigenesis. Cancer Res; 71(4); 1302–12. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Myeloid Translocation Gene, Related-1 (MTGR1) CBFA2T2,
MTG8 (RUNX1T1) and MTG16 (CBFA2T3) are members of a
gene family (MTGs) in which MTG8 and MTG16 were originally identified as targets of chromosomal translocations in
acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 1, 2). Translocations involved
in cancer identify master regulatory genes often affecting
cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. MTGs
are transcriptional corepressors lacking both enzymatic activity and DNA binding capabilities, and act as scaffolding

proteins upon which other transcriptional corepressors
(mSin3a, N-CoR, SMRT), histone deacetylases, and transcription factors assemble, thus directing promoter-specific targeting of repressor complexes (1, 2). The aggregate effect of these
complexes is chromatin remodeling via post-translational
histone modifications.
In addition to their pivotal role in AML, MTG8 and MTG16
have been implicated in epithelial malignancies, with the
identification of multiple nonsynonymous mutations in
MTG8 and MTG16 in colorectal carcinoma (CRC; 3, 4) and
more recently additional mutations in MTG8 identified in
breast and lung cancer (5). Furthermore, MTG16 is proposed
to function as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer (6).
Recently, it has been demonstrated that MTGs bind to transcription factor 4 (TCF4) and repress its transcriptional activity, thus linking MTGs with a stem cell regulatory pathway
critical for epithelial homeostasis that is frequently targeted in
malignancy (7). The role in tumorigenesis of MTGR1, the third
MTG family member, has yet to be determined.
Observations made in Mtgr1/ and Mtg8/ mice have
identified MTGs as participating in intestinal developmental
and differentiation programs. Roughly a third of Mtg8/ mice
demonstrate a complete deletion of the midgut (8). Mtg16/
mice revealed that MTG16 is required for hematopoietic

progenitor cell fate decisions and early progenitor differentiation (9). Mtgr1/ mice have increased intestinal proliferation
and the progressive depletion of the secretory lineage in the
small intestine, indicating that MTGR1 regulates intestinal
proliferation and differentiation programs (10). Additionally,
Mtgr1/ mice are sensitive to DSS-induced colitis and exhibit
chronic architectural changes with this type of injury implicating MTGR1 in epithelial repair programs (11). Collectively,
the genetic evidence suggests that MTG proteins play key roles
in intestinal biologic processes and could influence intestinal
tumorigenesis.
Chronic inflammation, as in Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's
Colitis, predisposes to malignancy (12–14), but with an
extended latency. While inflammation can be linked to tumorigenesis, the long latency makes the molecular basis of these
links less clear. Moreover, in certain malignancies inflammation may impair tumor growth. This is termed "tumor immunoediting" and represents the dynamic nature between the
antitumoral and protumoral activities of immunity (15). Thus
it is difficult to predict the impact a particular gene or pathway
may have on tumorigenesis a priori.
We hypothesized that MTGR1 could modify inflammatory
carcinogenesis, but whether this would be stimulatory or
inhibitory was unclear. In order to test this hypothesis, we
applied the azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/
DSS) murine inflammatory colitis model to Mtgr1/ mice.
This model has been employed to dissect NF-kB (16), toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4) (17), and tumor necrosis factor (TNFa) (18)
signaling, innate immune responses (19), and the role of
intestinal microflora (20) in inflammatory carcinogenesis.
We found a striking decrease in tumor formation in the

absence of MTGR1 coupled with increased intratumoral
apoptosis. This phenotype required injury and was nonhematopoietic cell autonomous; however, global gene expression
analysis revealed that members of WNT networks were
decreased and genes associated with innate and adaptive
immune networks upregulated in Mtgr1/ tumors, implicating tumor immunity as a potential mechanism of tumor
clearance. Supporting this concept, we observed decreased
nuclear b-catenin and increased CD3þ, B220þ, NKp46þ, and
F4/80þ infiltrates in Mtgr1/ tumors. Thus, MTGR1 is
required for efficient AOM/DSS-induced tumorigenesis and
may promote survival of initiated colonocytes perhaps by its
influence on suppressing tumor immunity.

Methods
Murine inflammatory carcinogenesis protocol
Eight- to ten-week old C57BL/6/129 mixed background
wild type (WT; n ¼ 22) or Mtgr1/ (n ¼ 19) mice were
injected with 12.5 mg/kg of AOM (Sigma-Aldrich) intraperitoneally as described by Greten and colleagues (21). After a
3-day recovery period, the animals were started on the first
of four cycles of 3% DSS ad libitum (See Schematic in
Fig. 1A). Each cycle lasted 5 days and was separated by a
16-day recovery period. After the last cycle, animals were
sacrificed following a 26-day recovery period. Tumor counts
and measurements were performed in a blinded fashion
under a stereo-dissecting microscope. Microscopic analysis
was performed for severity of inflammation (22) and dysplasia on (H&E) stained "Swiss rolled" colons by a gastrointestinal pathologist (MKW). All in vivo procedures were

carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the
Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Mtgr1 expression
Tumors and adjacent nontumor tissue from four colons
were dissected from WT mice and RNA was isolated using the
RNEasy MiniKit (Qiagen). SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) qRT-PCR
using Mtgr1 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) specific primers was performed in triplicate as
previously described (11). Analysis of fold-change was performed using the DDCt method.
In situ hybridization
The MTGR1–1699T and MTGR1–2020B probe set and
protocol of Amann and colleagues were used (10). Images
were taken on a Zeiss Axioskop under identical conditions.
Immunohistochemistry
Two hours prior to sacrifice, animals were injected with 16.7
mg/kg bromodeoxyuridine. Five micrometer sections were cut,
dewaxed, hydrated and endogenous peroxidase activity
quenched with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in MeOH. Antigen
retrieval was performed using the boiling sodium citrate
method in a microwave (20 mmol sodium citrate pH 6.5) for
16 minutes at 30% power. After blocking, primary antibody was
added (a-b-catenin, (BD Transduction Laboratories), 1:1000;
a-CD3, (Serotec), 1:1000; a-CD45r, (BD Pharmingen), 1:40,
monoclonal a-BrdU (Accurate Labs) 1:2000), a-arginase I
(ARG1), (Santa Cruz), 1:500; a-IL-1b, (R&D Systems), 1:50;
a-NKp46, (Santa Cruz), 1:500; a-matrilysin 338 (23), diluted
1:500) overnight at 4 C. Isotype-matched antibodies were
included as negative controls. The Vectastain ABC Elite System
(Vector Labs) was used to visualize staining for IHC. For
immunofluorescence, slides were counterstained with DAPI
(Invitrogen) and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade (Invitrogen). Identification of intratumoral apoptotic cells was
performed using the ApopTag Plus Peroxidase in situ Apoptosis
Kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Control stains were obtained by omitting the terminal transferase (TnT) enzyme. Immune cell, apoptosis, and proliferation
indices were generated by counting the number of positive cells
per high-powered field (HPF; 40 objective) within each tumor
(15 Mtgr1/ 42 WT tumors) from 9 Mtgr1/ and 14 WT tumor
bearing mice. A total of 82 Mtgr1/ and 319 WT HPFs were
examined and the mean positive cells per HPF was calculated.
A crypt apoptosis and proliferation index was generated by
counting 20 crypts per mouse. This is presented as the mean
number of TUNELþ or BrdUþ cells per crypt.
Cell culture and siRNA transfection
Human colon tumor (HCT116) cells were obtained from Dr.
Robert Coffey and have morphologic characteristics consistent with their known identity. Formal authentication was not
performed. One day prior to siRNA transfection, cells were
plated at 2  105 cells per well in a 6-well plate. Cells were then
transfected with ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA for
Mtgr1/CBFA2T2 (Thermo Scientific) using RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Six hours after

transfection, the transfection mixture was replaced with
complete media. The next day, cells were starved overnight
with media containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
the next morning cells were washed and complete media was
added. After harvesting, cells were analyzed for apoptosis
using the TACS Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry kit (R&D
Systems). Cells were analyzed on the 5-laser BD LSRII analyzer
and unstained controls were used to establish proper gating.
Presented are the average percentage of annexin V positive
cells per 10,000 cells over three different trials.
Expression array assays
Tumors were dissected from WT and Mtgr1/ mice and
RNA was isolated using the RNEasy MiniKit (Qiagen). RNA
integrity was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All RNA samples had
RNA integrity numbers (RINs) >8 and were deemed suitable
for hybridization. A total of 10 mg of cRNA was used in the
second cycle of first strand synthesis to generate the correct
sense for target hybridization. Mouse gene 1.0 ST arrays
(Affymetrix) were scanned the next day. CEL files were
imported into Partek Express (Partek) and Robust Multichip
Average (RMA) was run across all eight samples. Pivot data
was exported and posted. A t-test was run between the
Mtgr1/ and WT sample groups in Partek. The P-value
was multiple testing corrected with Bonferroni and Stepup. Expression array analysis was performed hybrizing cRNA
to the Mouse gene 1.0 ST chip (Affymetrix). Differentially
expressed genes were classified using the PANTHER (Protein
Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) classification
system (www.pantherdb.org/gen).
Bone marrow transplant
A single cell suspension of bone marrow cells was
obtained from the tibia and femur of two Mtgr1/ and
four WT 6-week old donor mice, and the red blood cells were
lysed with erythrocyte lysis buffer (Buffer EL, Qiagen). 0.85 
106 bone marrow cells were injected via the tail vein into 15
Mtgr1/ and 17 WT lethally irradiated (900 rads) 8–12-week
old recipient mice. The mice were then fed acidified water
(0.015% HCl in autoclaved water) supplemented with 1.1 g/L
neomycin sulfate and 125 mg/L polymyxin B sulfate for
2 weeks post-transplantation (modified from Cotta and
colleagues. (24)). Eight weeks post-transplantation, the mice
were placed on the Murine Inflammatory Carcinogenesis
Protocol.
Statistical methods
Apoptosis, proliferation, and immune cell indices as well as
the tumor and burden counts were analyzed using the
Student's t-test using Graphpad Prism 5.0c, unless otherwise
indicated.

MTGR1 Is Required for Efficient AOM/DSS Tumorigenesis

newly discovered role of MTGR1 in regulating these processes coupled with the observation that loss of MTGR1
results in sensitization to gut injury, we hypothesized that
Mtgr1 expression maybe altered in AOM/DSS tumors. For
these experiments, 8–10-week-old mice were injected with
AOM and treated with four cycles of DSS as defined in the
Methods section and shown in Figure 1A. Tumors and
adjacent tissue were harvested and both qRT-PCR and in
situ hybridization for Mtgr1 mRNA expression was performed. A 10.7-fold increase (P < 0.001) in Mtgr1 mRNA
expression was demonstrated in tumors compared to adjacent mucosa (Fig. 1B) and this expression was localized to a
majority of the epithelial cells within the tumor whereas in
adjacent histologically normal appearing colonic crypts it
was expressed in only a small population of epithelial cells
within the lower crypt region, consistent with the published
expression pattern (Fig. 1C; 10). We next wanted to determine if MTGR1 levels varied in human colon cancer. We were
unable to obtain human colitis associated carcinoma samples therefore we performed qRT-PCR for MTGR1 on two
colorectal cancer sample groups. The first consisted of
nonmatched normal and CRC tissues. In this group, we
observed a 2.3-fold increase in MTGR1 expression in the
CRC samples (P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S1A). We then
looked at nine matched normal/colon cancer samples and
found heterogeneity in MTGR1 expression, however, 55% of
the CRC samples demonstrated an increase in MTGR1
expression (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These results suggest
that MTGR1 may contribute to inflammatory carcinogenesis
in the colon and we postulated that deletion of MTGR1 may
prevent tumor formation.
Mtgr1 is required for efficient inflammatory
tumorigenesis
Using genetic manipulation in the mouse, we tested
whether MTGR1 was required for tumorigenesis in the
AOM/DSS model. Eight- to ten-week-old WT or Mtgr1/
mice were placed on the AOM/DSS protocol (Fig. 1A). Consistent with our prior report (11) Mtgr1/ mice experienced
greater weight loss in comparison to WT animals with each
DSS treatment. Looser stool was evident in both groups, with
frank blood frequently seen in the Mtgr1/ mice. Four weeks
after the last DSS cycle, the animals were sacrificed. Despite
the increased sensitivity to colitis, the Mtgr1/ mice actually
had significantly fewer polyps compared to WT mice (1.8 
0.5 vs 7.5  0.8, Fig. 2A) and decreased tumor size (4.6  0.62
mm2 vs 8.4  0.83 mm2, Fig. 2B), which was apparent upon
gross inspection (representative colons, Fig. 2C). Histologic
examination of H&E stained sections from colons prepared as
"Swiss Rolls" revealed adenomas with high grade dysplasia
characterized by loss of epithelial polarity and a more complex
tumor growth pattern frequently present in WT tumors,
whereas the adenomas observed in the Mtgr1/ colons
(Fig. 2D) more often showed only low grade dysplastic
changes. WT or Mtgr1/ mice treated either with AOM as
a single modality, or with multiple exposures to DSS in the
absence of AOM, did not develop tumors over this time frame
(data not shown).

www.aacrjournals.org

A decrease in tumor multiplicity in Mtgr1/ mice suggested that MTGR1 may be playing a role in initiated or early
tumor progenitor cell survival after injury, as opposed to
influencing tumor promotion, in which case similar number
of tumors, but smaller tumors would be expected. To determine if epithelial injury was required for this effect, we treated
animals with AOM as a single agent (12.5 mg/kg IP) and
assessed effects 48 weeks later. At necropsy, there was no
difference in polyp or aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation
between WT and Mtgr1/ mice (polyps, 3.5  0.2 vs 4.1  0.5,
P ¼ 0.40; ACF, 23.4  0.1 vs 27.0  2.0, P ¼ 0.21, Supplementary
Fig. S2A, B). These data indicate that alterations in epithelial
injury, either due to DSS itself or due to inflammatory infiltration was required for the different AOM/DSS phenotype in
Mtgr1/ versus WT mice. Collectively, these experiments
suggest that MTGR1 could protect early tumor progenitor
cells from clearance after enterocyte injury.
Altered intratumoral apoptosis in the absence of
MTGR1
Variations in proliferation or apoptosis may account for the
difference in tumor burden between Mtgr1/ and WT mice.
Intratumoral apoptosis rates were assessed using in situ
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) staining. Mtgr1/ mice demonstrated an average of
32.0  5.1 TUNELþ cells/tumor HPF. WT mice, on the other
hand, displayed 12.9  0.9 TUNELþ cells/tumor HPF (P <
0.001, Fig. 3A), while no differences were seen in apoptotic
indices within crypts. To investigate whether there is a direct
link between loss of MTGR1 and induction of apoptosis, we
utilized a cell culture model using the human colon cancer cell
line HCT116. Knockdown of MTGR1 by siRNA resulted in
increased apoptosis as measured by annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI) flow cytometry (Fig. 3B), but no change in proliferation (data not shown).
Next, to analyze proliferation rates, BrdU immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. BrdU positive cells/crypt
were counted and averaged. As observed previously (11),
nontumorigenic Mtgr1/ colonic epithelium showed a modest increase in proliferation compared to WT mice (5.2  0.3
vs 4.3  0.2 BrdU positive cells/crypt, P ¼ 0.02, Supplementary
Fig. 3A). However, intratumoral proliferation rates were similar between WT and Mtgr1/ mice (100.2  12.3/HPF vs 82.7
 7.3/HPF, P ¼ 0.28, Supplementary Fig. 3A), suggesting that
the difference in tumor formation and/or size was not a
function of differences in epithelial proliferation rates between
WT and Mtgr1/ animals, but more likely due to differences
in intratumoral apoptosis.
Decreased nuclear and total b-catenin in Mtgr1/
tumors
All three MTG family members (MTGR1, MTG16, and
MTG8) are capable of competing with b-catenin for TCF4
occupancy and can repress TCF4 mediated transcriptional
activity (7). Based on this observation, we stained WT or
Mtgr1/ tumors with a b-catenin specific antibody to determine the levels of b-catenin expression and its localization.
We derived a b-catenin staining index, which incorporates the

decreases in both Wnt (P ¼ 0.001) and Cadherin (P ¼

the most significant reductions in the WNT target Lgr5 (8.95fold), consistent with decreased WNT signaling tone in the
Mtgr1/ tumors. Paradoxically, repressors of WNT signaling

matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp-7 6.8x, Mmp-13 3.9x, Mmp-12
3.5x, and Mmp-14 3.4x) were also decreased in Mtgr1/
tumors (Supplemental Table 1). MMP7 is a known target
gene of the WNT pathway (26) and its overexpression has
been associated with colon cancer (27). We therefore assessed
MMP7 at the protein level by immunofluorescence, and
observed not only decreased expression but also decreased
secretion of MMP7 from colonic polyps in the Mtgr1/ versus
WT mice (Fig. 5A and B). These findings suggest that
decreases in WNT signaling and MMP expression may contribute to decreased tumor size in Mtgr1/ mice.
Immune pathways are upregulated in Mtgr1/ tumors

revealed increased MHC-I (P ¼ 0.001), MHC-II (P ¼ 0.003),

pathways (P ¼ 0.007), indicating that these gene classes are
over-represented in the Mtgr1/ tumors (Supplementary
Table 2). To both confirm and extend these observations,
we performed immunohistochemistry on WT and Mtgr1/
tumors to classify intratumoral inflammation. In Mtgr1/ vs
WT tumors (Fig. 6A and B), there were increased CD3þ Tlymphocytes (13.6  2.5/tumor HPF vs 49.4  5.6, P < 0.001),

were smaller than WT tumors and mononuclear phagocytes
can exert antitumor activity by directly killing tumor cells and
eliciting tissue disruptive reactions (28), we used F4/80 and IL1b costaining and observed increased M1 macrophages in

considered protumorigenic (28), we anticipated that costaining with F4/80 and ARG1 would identify fewer M2 mononuclear cells in the Mtgr1/ tumors. We were surprised to
find increased M2 cells in the Mtgr1/ tumors (15.8  2.6

induced tumors (Fig. 1C). However, MTGR1 is present in
many tissue types, including hematopoietic lineages (29).
Given the dramatic changes in inflammatory cell infiltration

in the tumors, MTGR1 could be acting in a hematopoietic cell
autonomous fashion to repress immune infiltration, or alternatively, MTGR1 could be acting in the stromal or epithelial
compartment to repress immune cell recruitment. To test
whether the MTGR1 effect is hematopoietic cell autonomous,
we restored MTGR1 expression in hematopoietic cells in the
Mtgr1/ mouse via bone marrow transplantation of WT
marrow. In addition, WT mice were transplanted with
Mtgr1/ marrow and control transplants consisting of WT
or Mtgr1/ mice transplanted with WT or Mtgr1/ marrow,
respectively, were also performed (Fig. 7A and B). Nontransplanted controls did not survive 2 weeks post-irradiation,

indicating that the endogenous marrow was ablated.
Transplanted animals were allowed to recover for 3 months
prior to placing the animals on the AOM/DSS protocol.
WT mice rescued with either WT or Mtgr1/ bone marrow
had equivalent tumor burden (2.125  0.693 and 1.5  0.756,
polyps/mouse, respectively). No tumors were observed in
either of the Mtgr1/ recipient groups. This indicates, at
least in this model, that it is the absence of MTGR1 in
nonhematopoietic cellular compartments that protects from
AOM/DSS-induced tumorigenesis. This data coupled with
increased epithelial apoptosis in the HCT-116 cells suggests
that MTGR1 promotes tumorigenesis through its actions in
the epithelium.
Discussion
Myeloid Translocation Genes (MTGs) are transcriptional
corepressors that were first identified in AML where the
prototypic event is the 8:21 translocation (30). Considerable
information has been gained from the creation of constitutional null alleles for each MTG family member. Mtgr1/
mice have increased enterocyte proliferation, mainly localized
to the lower 1/3 of the crypt, as well as the progressive

depletion of the secretory lineage in the small intestine
(10). The presence of MTGR1 is required for maintenance
of epithelial integrity after DSS-mediated injury and chronic
architectural changes occur after a solitary DSS-mediated
injury (11).
In this report, we demonstrate that MTGR1 is required for
efficient inflammatory-associated colonic carcinogenesis.
AOM is a procarcinogen and is metabolically activated to a
potent alkylating agent forming O6-methyl-guanine (31). Its
oncogenic potential is markedly augmented in the setting of
chronic inflammation, such as that induced by repeated cycles
of DSS treatment (32). The power of this model has recently
been demonstrated in deciphering the epithelial versus myeloid cell contribution of IKKb to polyp formation in the setting
of inflammation (21), and the contributions of IL-6 and its
downstream mediator, STAT-3 (33). IL-6 and MTGR1 are
required for maintenance of mucosal integrity after injury
(11), (33). Both Mtgr1/ and IL-6/ mice are protected from
tumorigenesis in the AOM/DSS model. In the case of the
Mtgr1/ mice, higher levels of intratumoral apoptosis, with
no appreciable difference in proliferation, may mediate the
beneficial affect of MTGR1 deletion. Injury is required for

Figure 7. Autologous transfer of Mtgr1þ/þ marrow does not reverse the Mtgr1/ AOM/DSS phenotype. Bone marrow transplants were performed on WT and
Mtgr1/ mice as indicated. A, wild type mice given Mtgr1/ bone marrow have more polyps per colon than Mtgr1/ mice given WT bone marrow (**P < 0.01).

the Mtgr1/ protective effect, as there was no difference in
tumor burden when mice were injected with AOM without
subsequent cycles of DSS. This suggests that MTGR1, similar
to IL-6, protects initiated epithelial cells from apoptosis. In the
case of IL-6, this is mediated via its production by lamina
propria myeloid cells, and our data indicate that hematopoetic
MTGR1 production does not modify tumorigenesis.
Alteration in WNT signaling is a common initiating event in
sporadic CRC (34); however, it is less common in colitisassociated carcinoma (CAC), and when it does occur, it
typically does so as a late event (35). We were surprised to
find evidence of low WNT signaling in Mtgr1/ tumors as it
has previously been shown that MTGs bind to TCF4 and
compete with b-catenin for occupancy; thus, at least in certain
circumstances, antagonizing WNT transduced signals (7). One
potential explanation for this apparent paradox is that MTGs
are known to function as transcriptional corepressors via
diverse interactions with multiple transcription factors (i.e.,
PLZF, BCL6, GFI-1) in addition to TCF4. They also form
bridging interactions with other transcriptional corepressors
such as N-CoR, SMRT, mSin3A, and HDACs 1, 2, and 3 (2, 36,
37). Our results suggest that the effect of MTGR1 on WNT
signaling may be less important than its ability to inhibit
apoptosis via modulating other pathways.
Our data suggest that loss of MTGR1 shifts the inflammatory response towards an antitumorigenic state by
increasing expression of tumoricidal immune cells such as
natural killer cells and M1 macrophage subsets. Perplexingly, there is also a concomitant increase in "protumorigenic" M2 polarized macrophages. It is theorized that there
is a balance between M1 (antitumorigenic) and M2 (protumorigenic) within the tumor microenvironment and it is
proposed that this balance could have different net effects at
different stages of tumor progression (28). As the overall
observed effect in the absence of MTGR1 was smaller and

1310

Cancer Res; 71(4) February 15, 2011

fewer tumors, this observation suggests that MTGR1 could
influence the balance between anti- and pro-tumorigenic
macrophage function. Furthermore, the fact that WT marrow transplanted into Mtgr1/ mice failed to prevent the
reduction in tumorigenesis in the Mtgr1/, AOM/DSS phenotype indicates that this process is not acting in an
autonomous manner in hematopoietic cell in this tumor
model. This raises the possibility that MTGR1 suppresses
inflammatory recruitment, perhaps via regulating production of epithelial derived chemokines and cytokines.
We observed decreased Mmp-7 (Matrilysin), 12, 13, and
14 in Mtgr1/ tumors. These matrix metalloproteinases
are overexpressed in human CRCs with increased Mmp-7
observed early in malignant progression and in 85%
of surveyed tumors (38). Mmp-7/ mice bred with ApcMin/þ
mice have a 50% decrease in polyposis (27, 39). MMP-7 has
pleiotropic effects promoting cancer progression via
its proteolytic activity against the ectodomain of a
number of cell surface proteins. For example, MMP-7 cleavage
of CD95L makes tumor cells resistant to apoptosis (40, 41),
MMP-7 mediated cleavage of proHB-EGF into mature HB-EGF
promotes proliferation and angiogenesis (42), and E-cadherin
is cleaved to soluble E-cadherin, promoting invasion (43). The
tumor promoting effects of increased MMP expression could
contribute to tumor growth differences and raises the intriguing possibility that MMPs may be important targets of
MTGR1-mediated repression.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that removal of MTGR1
enhances inflammation, increases intratumoral apoptosis,
and reduces production of proteins such as MMPs known
to be pivotal to tumor growth. Thus, MTGR1 appears to
influence the tumor microenvironment and in addition to
its effects on initiated cell survival may also suppress tumor
immunosurvelliance. These studies provide insight into
disease pathogenesis and implicate MTGR1 dysfunction in
