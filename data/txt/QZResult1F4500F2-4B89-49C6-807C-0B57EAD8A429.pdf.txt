Abstract
The Golgi apparatus is responsible for transporting, processing,
and sorting numerous proteins in the cell, including cell surfaceexpressed receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). The small-molecule
compound M-COPA [2-methylcoprophilinamide (AMF-26)] disrupts the Golgi apparatus by inhibiting the activation of Arf1,
resulting in suppression of tumor growth. Here, we report an
evaluation of M-COPA activity against RTK-addicted cancers,
focusing speciﬁcally on human gastric cancer (GC) cells with or
without MET ampliﬁcation. As expected, the MET-addicted cell
line MKN45 exhibited a better response to M-COPA than cell lines
without MET ampliﬁcation. Upon M-COPA treatment, cell surface

expression of MET was downregulated with a concurrent accumulation of its precursor form. M-COPA also reduced levels of the
phosphorylated form of MET along with the downstream signaling
molecules Akt and S6. Similar results were obtained in additional
GC cell lines with ampliﬁcation of MET or the FGF receptor FGFR2.
MKN45 murine xenograft experiments demonstrated the antitumor activity of M-COPA in vivo. Taken together, our results offer an
initial preclinical proof of concept for the use of M-COPA as a
candidate treatment option for MET-addicted GC, with broader
implications for targeting the Golgi apparatus as a novel cancer
therapeutic approach. Cancer Res; 76(13); 3895–903. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

"hepatocyte growth factor receptor") and ﬁbroblast growth factor
receptor 2 (FGFR2), which have been shown to drive cells to
malignant proliferation and survival (3, 4).
Thanks to recent progress in understanding molecular pathways underlying carcinogenesis, new targeted treatment options
have become available for treating cancer patients. In respect to
the development of targeted therapies, monoclonal antibodies
(mAb) and small-molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinase (TKI)
activity are ideal candidates that target tumor cells via binding to
RTKs. For example, trastuzumab is an mAb developed for treating
HER2-positive breast cancer; geﬁtinib is a small-molecule TKItargeting EGFR developed for treating lung cancer. So far, six mAbs
and 23 TKIs have been developed as approved drugs for treating
cancer; however, trastuzumab and ramucirumab are the only two
molecularly targeted drugs approved to date for treating GC
patients. Therefore, the development of new targeted drugs
against GCs is of keen interest. Because gene ampliﬁcation of
MET, HER2, and FGFR2 is often observed in GCs, many TKIs
targeting these RTKs have been developed and several clinical
trials in GC patients are in progress.
The Golgi apparatus plays an essential role in the transport,
processing, and sorting of numerous proteins (5–8). Most cellsurface and secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells pass through the
Golgi apparatus, allowing for posttranslational modiﬁcation such
as processing and glycosylation, and subsequently transport to
plasma membrane (9–11). Aberration of Golgi function is associated with certain forms of inherited diseases, cancer, and diabetes (12). ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), a small GTPase and a
member of Ras superfamily (13, 14), is required for maintenance
of Golgi structure and function via formation of complex I (COPI)
or clathrin-coated vesicles transported among the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), Golgi, and post-Golgi (15–19). We previously

Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide, and its incidence remains high especially in east
Asia, including Japan and Korea (1). GC is often diagnosed at an
advanced stage, and the prognosis of such patients is poor. Owing
to its diversity of morphologic forms and considerable heterogeneity, the classiﬁcation of GC has been complicated. Recently, The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network proposed a new
molecular classiﬁcation of GC into four subtypes (2). Among
these, approximately 50% of gastric tumors were categorized as
the chromosomal unstable subtype, containing frequent gene
ampliﬁcation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), such as human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), MET (also called

demonstrated that M-COPA (2-methylcoprophilinamide, also
called "AMF-26") suppressed Arf1-mediated vesicle transport,
disrupted the structure of the Golgi apparatus, and exerted antitumor activity in vivo against tumors xenografted into mice (20).
In fact, M-COPA has been shown to inhibit secretion of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and cell surface expression
of VEGFR-2 (21). Therefore, we postulated that M-COPA could
inhibit the processing and transport of RTKs to the cell surface and
extracellular space, and thereby exert antitumor activity against
RTK-addicted cancers.
In this study, using GC cell lines with or without MET ampliﬁcation, we demonstrated that M-COPA inhibited the processing
and transport of MET protein onto the cell surface, attenuated
aberrant MET signaling and exerted preferential antitumor activity
against MET-addicted GCs. Moreover, we obtained similar results
in FGFR2-ampliﬁed signet ring GC cells KATO III. The present
results suggest that a Golgi-targeted drug could be a novel therapeutic modality against MET-addicted GCs, as well as perhaps
RTK-addicted cancers from different origins.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
M-COPA (also called "AMF-26," chemical name: (2E,4E)-5[(1S,2S,4aR,6R,7S,8S,8aS)-7-hydroxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-1,2,4a,5,
6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-2-methyl-N-(pyridin-3ylmethyl)penta-2,4-dienamide] was totally synthesized by
Eisai Co., Ltd. according to the methods established previously
(22). 5-FU and paclitaxel were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Co. LLC., crizotinib was purchased from Selleck Chemicals.
For in vitro studies, these compounds were reconstituted to 20
mmol/L in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at 20 C. SN38 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and cisplatin was
purchased from Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd. For animal experiments, M-COPA was suspended in 0.15N hydrochloride acid
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Antibodies used for immunostaining are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell lines and cell culture
Four GC cell lines (St-4, MKN1, MKN45, and MKN74) are
components of the JFCR39 panel of human cancer cell lines
described previously (23, 24). Of these, St-4 was established in
our foundation in 1990 (25). MKN1, MKN45, and MKN74 were
purchased from Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. in
1991. Other two GC cell lines, Hs-746T, and SNU-5 were purchased from the ATCC in 2014. Cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) supplemented
with 5% (v/v) FBS (Moregate Biotech), penicillin (100 U/mL),
streptomycin (100 mg/mL), and kanamycin (1 mg/mL) in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere including 5% CO2 at 37 C. Authentication of St-4, MKN1, MKN45, and MKN74 cell lines was performed
by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis using PowerPlex16 Systems
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions by BEX
CO., LTD., in 2009 and 2016. Details were described in Supplemental Materials and Methods. Finally, the STR proﬁles of MKN1,
MKN45 and MKN74 were compared with those in the reference
database of the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell
Bank. Because St-4 was developed in our foundation and no
reference data was deposited, we compared the proﬁle determined in 2016 to that in 2009. The KATO III cell line was
originally purchased from the ATCC in 2000. Authentication of

3896 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

the cell line was performed in 2016 and compared the proﬁle with
that in the ATCC STR database.
Analysis of cell growth inhibition
The inhibition of cell growth was assessed by measuring changes
in total cellular protein in a culture of each GC cell line after 48
hours of drug treatment by use of a sulforhodamine B assay (26).
Positive values represent net protein increase before and after drug
exposure (% of control growth) and negative values represent cell
death [protein amount after 48 hours-exposure (%) of control cells
at the start of drug exposure]. The drug concentration required for
50% reduction in net protein increase (GI50) was calculated as
described previously (23, 27, 28).
Flow cytometric analysis
Cells were incubated with M-COPA for 6 or 24 hours, and then
washed with ice-cold PBS and stained with antibodies against
human MET or human FGFR2 conjugated with phycoerythrin
(PE). Then cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and
stained with propidium iodide (1 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). The
ﬂuorescence intensity of cell surface MET or FGFR2 was measured
by ﬂow cytometric analysis (FACS Calibur or FACS Verse, Becton,
Dickinson and Company). The data were analyzed by using
FlowJo (FlowJo LLC.).
Western blot analysis
Cells were incubated with M-COPA for 1, 6, or 24 hours, and
then lysed as described previously (29). Proteins in cell lysates
were separated in 4% to 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories) electrophoresis, followed by
electroblotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Immunoreactive bands were identiﬁed with an ODYSSEY CLx Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).
Animal experiments
The antitumor effect of M-COPA was tested in vivo against
MKN45-derived human GC xenografts in mice. Animal care and
treatment was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the
Animal Use and Care Committee of the Japanese Foundation for
Cancer Research, and conformed to the NIH Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals. Female nude mice of BALB/c genetic
background were purchased from Charles River Laboratories
JAPAN, Inc., maintained under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions
and provided with sterile food and water ad libitum. Each nude
mouse was subcutaneously inoculated with a generated tumor
fragment of size 3 mm  3 mm  3 mm. When the tumors reached
a volume of 100 to 300 mm3, animals were randomly divided into
control and M-COPA groups (each group containing ﬁve or six
mice). Then administration of M-COPA was started (day 0). The
experimental group of mice was orally administered a given dose of
M-COPA (50 mg/kg of BW) on a daily basis from day 0 to 4 (n ¼ 6),
or weekly (75 mg/kg of BW) on day 0, 7, and 14 (n ¼ 5). The control
group of mice (n ¼ 6) was orally administered with 0.15N
hydrochloride acid solution instead of M-COPA. The tumor volume of tumor-bearing mice was measured as described previously
(29). To assess toxicity, the body weights of the tumor-bearing mice
were measured.
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections (4-mmthick) were deparafﬁnized in xylene and taken through a series

Antitumor Effect of a Golgi Disruptor in MET-Addicted Cancer

Figure 1.
Inhibitory effect on cell surface expression of MET. M-COPA signiﬁcantly inhibited cell surface expression of MET protein in cell lines with MET gene ampliﬁcation.
A, baseline expression of MET, EGFR, HER2, HER3, FGFR2, and their phosphorylated forms in the JFCR39 GC cell line panel and MET-addicted cell lines,
such as Hs-746T and SNU-5, were examined by immunoblot analysis. Cells were lysed and the proteins in the cell extract were separated by SDS-PAGE and
electroblotted onto a membrane. The membrane was then probed with antibodies against the indicated proteins. Experiments were performed at least
twice and representative results are indicated. The positive control lysates were as follows: EGFR and p-EGFR from NCI-H3255 that had EGFR-activating
mutation, HER2 and p-HER2 from EGF-stimulated HBC-5, HER3 and p-HER3 from heregulin b1-stimulated MCF-7, and FGFR2 from KATO III. B and C, MET
expression on the cell surface was measured by FACS analysis. Cells were treated with M-COPA at the indicated concentrations for 6 or 24 hours and stained
with a PE-conjugated anti-MET antibody. Lines and areas were used to indicate drug concentrations: Black solid lines with dark gray area, no drug; black
dotted lines, 30 nmol/L; black dashed lines, 100 nmol/L; black long dashed lines, 300 nmol/L; black chain lines with light gray area, 1,000 nmol/L; gray
solid lines, stained with isotype-control IgG. Experiments were performed at least twice and representative results are indicated.

of graded alcohols to water. Then antigens were retrieved through
wet autoclave pretreatment (20 min at 121 C) in 10 mmol/L
citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Sections were blocked with 3% H2O2 and
1% goat serum before incubation with the primary antibody at
4 C overnight. By using Dako EnVision Detection System/HRP,
Rabbit/Mouse (DABþ; Agilent Technologies Company), sections
were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated
polymer secondary antibody, and thereafter peroxidase activity
was visualized by DAB reaction according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin
(Dako). The immuno-stained specimens were imaged using a
microscope BX41 (Olympus Corp.) with a 20x, NA 0.50, objective, and DP2-BSW Software (Olympus Corp.).

Statistical analysis
The two-sided Mann–Whitney U test was used to assess the
statistical signiﬁcance of the antitumor efﬁcacy of M-COPA in terms
of relative tumor growth ratio and body weight change on days 2, 4,
8, 11, 15 and 18. The number of samples is indicated in the
description of each experiment. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results
Overexpression of MET protein and the Inhibitory effect of MCOPA on its cell surface expression in MET-ampliﬁed GC cells
First, we examined the effect of M-COPA on cell surface
expression of MET protein in GC cell lines. To this end, we

exploited three GC cell lines with or without MET ampliﬁcation.
As shown in Fig. 1A, the MET-ampliﬁed GC cell lines, MKN45,
Hs-746T, and SNU-5, overexpressed total MET protein and its
phosphorylated active form, as previously reported (30). The St-4
cell line also expressed total and phosphorylated form of MET,
even though the intensities of those expression were weaker than
those of MET-ampliﬁed GC cells. We also examined baseline
expression of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and FGFR2, which have been
reported to be ampliﬁed in GC cells (2). None of the phosphorylated forms of these proteins except HER3 in MKN45 were
detected in any of the GC cell lines examined, although total
EGFR and HER3 were detected in some cell lines.
We then examined cell surface expression of MET and the effect
of M-COPA treatment in these GC cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1B,
baseline MET expression on the cell surface was higher in METampliﬁed GC cell lines (MKN45, Hs-746T, SNU-5) than that
observed in other GC cell lines, in parallel with the levels of total
MET protein determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A). Upon
treatment with M-COPA for 24 hours, cell surface expression of
MET efﬁciently decreased in a dose-dependent manner; it was
signiﬁcantly reduced at concentrations of 100 nmol/L or higher in
SNU-5 and MKN45 cells, whereas 300 nmol/L was needed to
mediate such reduction in Hs-746T cells. Next, we examined the
expression proﬁle of MET protein over time following treatment
of MKN45 cells with M-COPA. After 6 hours treatment, MET
protein expression was reduced to approximately 25% (1/4) at
concentrations of 100 nmol/L or higher and was dramatically
declined to negative control levels (IgG-isotype control antibody)
within 24 hours at concentrations of 300 nmol/L or higher
(Fig. 1C). From these data, we concluded that M-COPA efﬁciently
inhibited cell surface expression of MET protein in MET-ampliﬁed
GC cells, in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
Growth inhibitory effect of M-COPA against GC cell lines with
or without MET ampliﬁcation
We next evaluated the effect of M-COPA on the growth of GC
cell lines with or without MET ampliﬁcation. Expectedly, all three
MET-ampliﬁed cell lines were highly sensitive to the MET inhibitor crizotinib (Fig. 2B), as compared with other GC cell lines,
indicating that their growth was addicted to MET, in agreement
with previous reports (31). Interestingly, MET-ampliﬁed cell
lines also exhibited a better drug response to M-COPA than
those without MET ampliﬁcation, albeit the selectivity was not
as marked as that observed with crizotinib (Fig. 2A). Moreover,
the concentrations of M-COPA needed to inhibit cell growth
was comparable with those needed to inhibit cell surface
expression of MET in the MET-ampliﬁed cell lines; the GI50
concentration for the MKN45, Hs-746T, and SNU-5 cell lines
was 29, 40, and 19 nmol/L, respectively. These data indicated
that M-COPA preferentially inhibited the growth of METaddicted GC cells and the growth inhibition coincided with
decreased expression of MET protein on the cell surface. For
comparison, the anticancer effects of chemotherapeutic agents
used in the clinic for GC patients, namely 5-FU, paclitaxel, SN38, and cisplatin, were examined. However, neither 5-FU,
paclitaxel nor cisplatin exhibited signiﬁcant differences in terms
of growth inhibitory activities in the GC cell lines with MET
ampliﬁcation with the only exception that SNU-5 tended to be
highly sensitive to these agents. On the other hand, SN-38
exhibited preferential activity in these MET-ampliﬁed cell lines
in a similar vein to M-COPA (Fig. 2C–F).

inhibited the cell growth of MET-addicted cell lines in a more robust manner
than that observed with non-addicted cell lines. The inhibition of cell
proliferation was assessed by measuring changes in total cellular protein.
After 48 hours of drug treatment, cells were ﬁxed and stained by use of a
sulforhodamine B assay. Growth curves under drug treatment with M-COPA

The effect of M-COPA on processing of MET protein and its
downstream signaling molecules in MET-ampliﬁed GC cells
MET is a transmembrane heterodimer that composed of two
disulﬁde-linked chains of 50 kDa a-subunit and 145 kDa b-subunit (32). The molecule is originally synthesized as a single-chain
170-kDa precursor (Pr170), which is cotranslationally glycosylated. Terminal glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage generate
the mature heterodimer (33). To clarify whether M-COPA could
disturb processing of MET, expression levels of the precursor form
and a mature b-subunit of MET were estimated in MKN45 cells by
Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, the amount of the
Pr170 was increased upon treatment with M-COPA in a dosedependent manner at 6 hours, whereas the active b-subunit and
phosphorylated form of MET were decreased. Finally, the active
phosphorylated form of MET were dramatically reduced at

Antitumor Effect of a Golgi Disruptor in MET-Addicted Cancer

regulation of cell surface expression, electrophoretic mobility shift
probably due to inhibition of post-translational modiﬁcation,
and dephosphorylation of FGFR2 protein, and ﬁnally decreased
phosphorylated form of downstream signaling molecules such as
Akt and S6 (Fig. 4A and B). These effects were observed in the
similar concentration range to that required for inhibition of cell
growth (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that M-COPA suppressed cell surface expression of FGFR2 as a result of Golgi
dysfunction, and thereby exerted antitumor effect in FGFR2ampliﬁed cells, as well as MET-ampliﬁed cells.
Antitumor efﬁcacy of M-COPA against MKN45-derived tumor
xenografts in vivo
Finally, we tested the antitumor efﬁcacy of M-COPA against
tumor xenografts derived from the MET-ampliﬁed GC cell line,

Time-course and dose-dependent effects on processing of MET protein, and

its downstream signaling at the same concentration range and time points as
observed with respect to the inhibitory effect on cell surface expression of
MET in MKN45 cells. A and B, after M-COPA treatment with indicated
concentrations for 1, 6, or 24 hours, MKN45 cells were lysed. A, processing

concentrations of 100 nmol/L or higher in 24 hours, in parallel to
inhibition of cell surface expression of MET (Fig. 1C) and cell
growth (Fig. 2A). These results indicated that the processing and
the transport of MET protein onto the cell surface were prevented
by M-COPA treatment.
We next examined the effect of M-COPA on the activation status
of the downstream signaling pathway from MET. M-COPA
decreased the levels of phosphorylated Gab2, Akt, and S6 within
the same drug concentration range and time-course as those
required for inhibition of MET processing and transport (Fig.
3B). The effectiveness of M-COPA was also demonstrated in other
two MET-addicted GC cell lines, Hs-746T and SNU-5 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). M-COPA also inhibited the cell surface expression of MET in St-4 cells (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we investigated the
activation status of MET and its downstream signaling pathway
molecules. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1B, M-COPA
repressed the MET processing, MET-activation, and phosphorylation of Akt. However, phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein
was still remained by M-COPA treatment, and concordantly St-4
cell line showed lower sensitivity to crizotinib and M-COPA
(Fig. 2A). From these data, we concluded that M-COPA inhibited
the MET-dependent signaling pathway via inhibition of MET
processing and its cell surface expression as mediated by the
Golgi apparatus, resulted in attenuating the abnormal cell
proliferation in MET-ampliﬁed GC cell lines.
The antitumor effect of M-COPA against FGFR2-ampliﬁed GC
cells
To examine the effect of other RTKs ampliﬁed in GCs, we
exploited KATO III, which was known as a FGFR2-ampliﬁed
signet ring cell GC cell line that exhibited a high sensitivity to
FGFR2-TKI (34, 35). As we expected, M-COPA caused down-

measured by FACS analysis. Cells were treated with M-COPA at the indicated

used as described in Fig. 1B legend. B, after M-COPA treatment with indicated
concentrations for 24 hours, KATO III cells were harvested and cell lysates
were prepared. Immunoblot analysis of total and phosphorylated form of
FGFR2 protein and phosphorylation status of downstream signaling
molecules, including Akt and S6 ribosomal protein (S6), were examined.
C, the inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by sulforhodamine B assay.
Symbols were used as described in Fig. 2 legend.

MKN45, in vivo. M-COPA was orally administrated daily for the
ﬁrst 5 days, or weekly for 3 weeks. In both administration groups,
treatment with M-COPA signiﬁcantly decreased the tumor size
than that observed in the control group (Fig. 5A, top). Slight but
signiﬁcant weight loss was observed in the daily administration
group on days 2 and 4; however, after stopping administration, no
signiﬁcant difference was observed among the three groups on
day 8 and later (Fig. 5A, bottom).
To validate the proof of concept that M-COPA administration exerts an antitumor effect via inhibition of cell surface
expression of MET, we examined the expression of phosphorylated MET in tumor tissue sections by immunohistochemistry.
The immunostaining intensities of phosphorylated MET on the
cell membrane were markedly decreased in the M-COPA–treated group on day 2 compared with those in the control group
(Fig. 5B and C). These data strongly suggested that M-COPA
exerted an in vivo antitumor effect on MET-ampliﬁed MKN45derived xenografts via downregulation of cell surface expression of active MET.

Discussion
As mentioned, MET protein is produced as a 170 kDa singlechain precursor form, and the precursor is then posttranslationally
glycosylated, cleaved to yield a mature form consisted of an
a-chain (50 kDa) and a b-chain (145 kDa) via the Golgi apparatus
(32, 33, 36). In MET-ampliﬁed cells, overexpression of MET
protein triggers its autophosphorylation and recruitment of its

3900 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

effectors, resulting in hyperactivation of intracellular downstream
signaling pathways, including the PI3K–AKT axis (37). This abnormal signal activation is known to drive cells to malignant proliferation, thereby entering a "MET-addicted" state (38, 39). In the
present study, we clearly demonstrated that M-COPA decreased
the level of the active b-subunit form and increased the precursor
form in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with a previous
report showing that a Golgi inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) abrogated
the processing of nascent MET protein (36). Moreover, we found
for the ﬁrst time that inhibition of MET processing by M-COPA
coincided with downregulation of its cell surface expression and
abrogation of its downstream oncogenic signals represented by
reduction of phosphorylated forms of Gab, Akt, and S6, and
ultimately suppressed tumor growth in MET-addicted GC cell
lines. Downregulation of cell surface expression of activated MET
protein in parallel to the observed antitumor effects was also
conﬁrmed in the case of MKN45-derived tumor xenografts after
administration of M-COPA in vivo. These results strongly suggested
that inhibition of processing and cell surface expression of MET
protein is the main mechanism by which M-COPA exerts antitumor effects against MET-addicted GC cells. In addition to MET,
phosphorylated HER3 was also detected in MKN45 cells (Fig. 1A),
as previously reported (40). MET has been shown to interact with
HER3 and activate HER3 signal in gastric and lung cancer cells (40,
41). In our study, M-COPA also repressed phosphorylation and
cell surface expression of HER3 (Supplementary Fig. S2), as well as
MET, suggesting that repression of HER3 signal could also be
involved in antitumor effect of M-COPA in MKN45 cells.

Antitumor Effect of a Golgi Disruptor in MET-Addicted Cancer

We also demonstrated that cell surface expression of FGFR2 was
also downregulated by M-COPA treatment in FGFR2-addicted
KATO III, a human signet ring cell GC cell line (Fig. 4). FGFR2 is
known as a target for cancer therapy, and now several FGFR2-TKIs,
such as AZD4547, are in clinical study stage. M-COPA also
repressed the maturation of FGFR2, phosphorylation of its signaling pathway molecules, and inhibited cell growth under the
concentration of submicromole order. These data strongly suggested that M-COPA could exert antitumor effect in cancer cells
addicted to not only MET but also FGFR2 and other RTKs,
including HER2, mutant EGFR, and so on.
St-4 is a cell line that expresses small amount of MET protein
(Fig. 1A). This cell line is not addicted to MET expression and it did
not respond to crizotinib (Fig. 2B). Our results indicated that MCOPA abolished cell surface expression (Fig. 1B) and processing
of MET, but it hardly affected phosphorylation level of S6 ribosomal protein (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and did not exhibit high
sensitivity to M-COPA (Fig. 2A). In contrast, St-4 expresses substantial amount of EGFR at the cell surface, but M-COPA hardly
attenuated cell surface expression of EGFR (Supplementary Fig.
S3). The precise mechanism by which these differences in MCOPA response were achieved remains unclear. Interestingly,
phosphorylated form of MET was detected but that of EGFR was
hardly detected in the St-4 cell line before drug exposure (Fig. 1A),
suggesting that cell surface expression of RTKs in its activated form
could be selectively abolished by M-COPA treatment. Involvement of phosphorylated status of RTKs in M-COPA efﬁcacy is
under investigation.
Besides RTKs, we examined the effect of M-COPA on ABC
transporters such as P-glycoprotein and BCRP. Although M-COPA
reduced cell surface expression of BCRP in BCRP-expressing breast
cancer HBC-5 cells, it did not affect cell surface expression of Pglycoprotein in adriamycin-resistant AD10 cells derived from
human ovarian cancer A2780 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). We
have not yet determined the mechanism by which these differences caused, but we supposed that the differences in coated
vesicles (e.g., COPI-coated or clathrin-coated vesicles) may cause
different M-COPA response. Further studies are needed to clarify
the mechanism by which M-COPA attenuates protein expression
at the cell surface.
There are three approaches to downregulation of HGF/MET
signaling in human clinical studies: anti-HGF mAbs, anti-MET
mAbs, and small-molecule MET TKIs (42). Class I TKIs, such as
crizotinib, bind to the MET ATP–binding pocket and show
speciﬁcity against MET and some other tyrosine kinases, including
ALK (43). Crizotinib seemed to exert better antitumor activities to
MET-ampliﬁed GC xenografts (44), in other words, M-COPA
response was modest as compared with crizotinib (Fig. 5). However, crizotinib usage has been reported to induce a second
mutation at the gatekeeper position of the ATP-binding pocket
of the targeted kinases, resulting in acquired resistance (45, 46).
Class II TKIs such as cabozantinib, show broad speciﬁcity as
compared with class I inhibitors, binding to a region past the
gatekeeper position and occupying a hydrophobic pocket at a
deeper location (47). The present results imply that Golgi-targeted
drugs such as M-COPA could be a novel therapeutic option in
addition to mAbs and TKIs for treating GCs addicted to MET or
FGFR2 via inhibition of the processing and the transport of MET/
FGFR2 onto the cell surface. Moreover, this class of drug could also
be useful for treating cancers from different tissues of origin whose
growth is dependent on RTK expression, especially those harbor-

ing a secondary mutation exhibiting acquired resistance to pretreated TKIs. In this situation, the Golgi-targeted drugs are also
expected to overcome the TKI resistance by inhibiting cell surface
expression of the mutated RTKs. The effect of M-COPA on other
RTK-addicted cancer cells (e.g., EGFR-mutated lung cancer) and
TKI-resistant cells is under investigation.
We demonstrated that M-COPA exhibited higher sensitivity
to MET-addicted cell lines than MET non-addicted cell lines
(Fig. 2A); however, the selectivity for MET-addicted cells was
not as marked as that seen with crizotinib. In other words, MCOPA did partially interfere with the growth of MET nonaddicted GC cells. Although we demonstrated that neither
EGFR, HER2, HER3, nor FGFR2 were activated in these cell
lines, involvement of other RTKs or other cell surface proteins
should be considered. BFA, another Golgi disruptor, is known
to trigger ER stress and unfolded protein response (48), and
similar efﬁcacy of M-COPA is expected. Involvement of this
pathway in antitumor effect of M-COPA in both MET-addicted
and non-addicted cancer cells is under investigation. On the
other hand, a selection of chemotherapeutic drugs, apart from
SN-38, did not display any evidence of MET status-speciﬁc
sensitivity in the panel of MET ampliﬁed and unampliﬁed cell
lines tested (Fig. 2C–F). The reason why SN-38 was more
sensitive toward MET-addicted cell lines than nonaddicted cell
lines remains unclear.
In M-COPA–treated MET-ampliﬁed cell lines, processing of
MET protein was suppressed, but the loss of mature MET b-chain
was not accompanied by a corresponding increase of MET precursor, especially in SNU-5 cells. At present, we have not yet
elucidated the precise mechanism by which this occurred, and the
fate of MET protein in M-COPA treated cells remains unclear.
Unfolded protein response is known to attenuate translation
initiation via phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha by PERK (48).
Therefore, one possibility is that attenuation of total MET protein
might be occurred as a consequence of general translation
suppression.
We assessed M-COPA–induced toxicity by measuring body
weight loss. As described before, slight weight loss was observed
in the daily administration group, whereas weight loss was
alleviated after stopping administration. Concurrently, loss of
weight was observed in tumor bearing control mice, as well as
those weekly administered, in accordance with the previous report
that inoculation of MKN45 cells into nude mice caused cachexia
and body weight loss (49), which resulted in no signiﬁcant
difference among the three groups on day 8 and later.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that M-COPA inhibited the
processing and the transport of MET protein onto the cell surface,
attenuated aberrant MET signaling, and exerted a preferential
antitumor activity of M-COPA against MET-addicted GCs. The
present results suggested that a Golgi-targeted drug could be a
novel therapeutic modality that has a unique mode of action for
targeting RTK, in addition to mAb and TKI therapies.
