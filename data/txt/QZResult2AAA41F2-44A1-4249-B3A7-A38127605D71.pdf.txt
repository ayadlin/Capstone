BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Pelvic external beam radiotherapy
(EBRT) is known to increase the risk of hip fractures in women, but the effect in men is unknown. METHODS: From
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, 45,662 men who were aged 66 years
and diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1992-2004 were identified. By using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards models, the primary outcome of hip fracture risk was compared among men who received radical
prostatectomy (RP), EBRT, EBRT plus androgen suppression therapy (AST), or AST alone. Age, osteoporosis, race,
and other comorbidities were statistically controlled. A secondary outcome was distal forearm fracture as an indicator of the risk of fall-related fracture outside the radiation field. RESULTS: After covariates were statistically controlled, the findings showed that EBRT increased the risk of hip fractures by 76% (hazards ratio [HR], 1.76; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.38-2.40) without increasing the risk of distal forearm fractures (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56-1.14).
Combination therapy with EBRT plus AST increased the risk of hip fracture 145% relative to RP alone (HR, 2.45; 95%
CI, 1.88-3.19) and by 40% relative to EBRT alone (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.17-1.68). EBRT plus AST increased the risk of distal
forearm fracture by 43% relative to RP alone (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.97-2.10). The number needed to treat to result in 1
hip fracture during a 10-year period was 51 patients (95% CI, 31-103). CONCLUSIONS: In men with prostate cancer,
pelvic 3-D conformal EBRT was associated with a 76% increased risk of hip fracture. This risk was slightly increased
further by the addition of short-course AST to EBRT. This risk associated with EBRT must be site-specific as there
was no increase in the risk of fall-related fractures in bones that were outside the radiation field. Cancer

Hip fracture is associated with high morbidity and significant mortality.1,2 Osteoporosis is the single greatest risk factor
for fractures in general and hip fracture in particular. Factors associated with osteoporosis include age, body mass index,
multiple comorbidities, glucocorticoid therapy, postmenopausal status in women, and androgen suppression therapy
(AST) for prostate cancer in men.3 Fragility fractures, such as distal forearm and hip fracture, are uniquely associated with
falls.4 It is well accepted that pelvic external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for gynecological malignancies and anorectal carcinoma in women increases the risk of hip fractures5,6; the mechanism is understood to be radiation-induced osteonecrosis
that can occur as the beam path passes through the bone to reach the target site.7-9
The effect of pelvic EBRT on hip-fracture risk in men is unknown. Prostate cancer is the most common solid-organ
malignancy in men, affecting nearly 200,000 men annually. In 2006, 28% of all men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer received EBRT within 6 months of diagnosis.10 Elderly men with prostate cancer are more commonly treated with
EBRT, with or without AST, than younger men.11,12 Elderly men are also the subpopulation at highest risk for hip

fracture on the basis of their age and comorbidities.
Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated improved
survival with EBRT plus 6 months to 36 months of AST
(EBRT þ AST) compared with either treatment alone in
locally advanced prostate cancer,13,14 and 50% of high
risk prostate cancer patients treated with EBRT also
receive AST.15 Moreover, recent evidence shows that men
with high-risk prostate cancer treated with lifelong androgen deprivation have improved survival with the addition
of EBRT.16
The prevalence of prostate cancer combined with
high use of EBRT, particularly in the elderly, plus the frequent combination of EBRT þ AST intensify the need
for understanding the effect of EBRT alone or in combination with AST on prostate cancer patients’ risk of developing hip fractures, especially among the elderly.
Our hypotheses were that compared with radical
prostatectomy (RP), pelvic EBRT increases the risk of hip
fractures, but not fragility fractures outside the radiation
field (distal forearm fractures), and that EBRT þ AST
would have a higher risk of hip fractures than EBRT
alone. Our analysis was limited to 3-D conformal EBRT
(henceforth termed EBRT) and did not include intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
After approval from the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board, data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer
registry linked to Medicare enrollment and utilization
data (SEER-Medicare). SEER contains patient and tumor
characteristics as well as complete treatment information
through 6 months after cancer diagnosis. The 17 geographic regions composing the SEER registry account for
26% of the US population. An elderly subset of the SEER
population can be followed beyond their initial year after
diagnosis by linking their SEER information to claims
data available through Medicare.
Study Subjects
Men aged 66 years or older who received a first diagnosis of nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the years 1992
through 2004 were identified in SEER (n ¼ 232,071;
Fig. 1). To ensure complete information, we limited our
analysis to those most likely to have complete claims; we
excluded patients who were not enrolled in both Part A
and Part B Medicare for the 12 months before prostate

cancer diagnosis or throughout the study period followup, whose prostate cancer had been diagnosed on autopsy or on a death certificate, and those for whom the
month of diagnosis was unknown (n remaining ¼
151,867). Because they might have received treatment
that could put them at risk for fracture, 17,123 men
with a prior cancer were excluded. We limited our comparisons to those men managed with 1 of 4 nonoverlapping treatment strategies within 6 months of prostate
cancer diagnosis: 1) radical prostatectomy (RP) without
EBRT or AST, 2) EBRT without AST, 3) EBRT þ
AST, or 4) AST without EBRT. EBRT was limited to
3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy because IMRT
was not used in significant quantity in the Medicare
population until 2003, and the short follow-up available
(through 2007) would be inadequate to draw conclusions about the long-term risk of hip fracture. We
excluded men who received any of these therapies for
the first time after 6 months to yield a uniform risk
group who were all ‘‘exposed’’ to the etiology of interest
soon after cancer diagnosis. Among those receiving
EBRT þ AST, we included only those who received a
range (6 months to 36 months) of AST doses supported

by evidence. These limitations excluded men who initiated AST later in their disease course (after 6 months for
the RP and EBRT groups and after 36 months for the
EBRT þ AST group), thus minimizing the possibility of
new metastatic disease after 6 months. Because AST as a
sole therapy in nonmetastatic disease is not supported by
evidence, we did not place an upper limit on the length
of therapy but did require that at least 3 months (commonly, 1 depot injection) be given. This yielded a final
cohort of 45,662. Of these men, 7854 also received
brachytherapy, cryotherapy, or thermal ablation. We
alternately included, excluded, and censored these 7854
men and assessed for a change in outcomes.
Outcomes Defined
Our primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of
hospitalization for hip fracture through 2007, identified
by Medicare inpatient claims. The cumulative incidence
of distal forearm fracture was determined from Medicare
Part A and B (ie, hospital and physician claims) claims for
fracture of the radius and/or ulna. We excluded fractures
that occurred in the year of diagnosis to allow for a
washout of differences in baseline risk and because such
radiation effects are thought to be delayed in onset.
Demographic and Cancer Characteristics
Age was defined as the age at diagnosis of prostate cancer
and was categorized in 5-year increments. A modification
of the Charlson comorbidity index for use with Medicare
claims data was used.17 Charlson score was categorized as
0, 1, 2. Disease grade and stage were obtained from the
SEER database. Grade was categorized by World Health
Organization strata. Stage was categorized by using the
1997 modification (ie, 2 substages within T2) of the TNM
classification because more detailed stage information as
reported in the 1992 modification (ie, 3 substages within
T2) is not available in SEER for the years 1998-2003.
Race, year of diagnosis, and SEER registry (ie, geographic
location) were determined from SEER. A history of osteoporosis was identified from diagnosis codes on Medicare
Part A or B claims in the year before cancer diagnosis. Demographic and cancer characteristics were compared across
primary cancer treatment groups, and significant differences were determined by chi-square analysis.
Cumulative Incidence of Hip and Distal
Forearm Fracture
Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analysis was used to measure

forearm fracture, stratified by primary cancer treatment
group. Fracture rates were compared across treatment
groups by using the log-rank test. Men were censored at
diagnosis of a second cancer, death, or end of study.
Multivariate Model
Multivariate time-to-event analyses were performed with
the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression. Separate
models were constructed for the outcomes of hip and distal forearm fracture. The primary etiology of interest was
the type of prostate cancer treatment. We were, thus, primarily interested in the hazard ratio of hip or distal forearm fracture in those managed with EBRT versus RP,
AST versus RP, and EBRT þ AST versus RP. We also
report the risk of hip and distal forearm fracture after
treatment with EBRT þ AST versus EBRT. Other covariates in the model included age, race, year of diagnosis,
registry, comorbidities, osteoporosis, tumor stage, and
tumor grade. To provide an absolute measure of the
impact of EBRT on hip fracture, the number of men who
must be treated with EBRT to result in 1 hip fracture was
calculated. This was performed by calculating the inverse
of the difference between the adjusted risk of hip fracture
in the RP-treated and EBRT-treated men at 10 years. All
analyses were 2-sided. Type 1 error rate was set at P < .05.
All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

RESULTS
The final cohort of 45,662 consisted of 8146 men managed with RP, 13,396 managed with EBRT, 6974 managed with EBRT þ AST, and 17,146 managed with AST
(Table 1). Median follow-up for the total cohort was 49
months and varied by treatment group (RP, 54 months;
EBRT, 62 months; EBRT þ AST, 46 months; AST, 38
months; Table 1). The 10-year probability of overall survival likewise varied across treatment groups with RPtreated men having the highest likelihood of survival
(77%) followed by EBRT (48%), EBRT þ AST (40%),
and AST (29%). Of the 45,662 men in the cohort, 1636
(3.6%) developed hip fracture; distal forearm fracture
occurred in 451 (1%; Table 1).
Demographic and Cancer Characteristics
Stratified by Cancer Treatment
Men treated with RP were the youngest and healthiest
group and had the best 10-year overall survival, whereas
those managed with AST were the oldest and were
more likely to have multiple comorbidities and the lowest

10-year overall survival (Table 1). Men treated with
EBRT or EBRT þ AST were of intermediate age, had intermediate levels of comorbidities, and had intermediate
survival. Known osteoporosis at baseline was rare in all
groups (1.3%-2.3%). Of both RP-treated and EBRTtreated men, 14% had high-grade disease, whereas the
rate of high-grade disease in those receiving EBRT þ AST
was 38% and in those receiving AST was 28%. Less than
5% of men in the EBRT, EBRT þ AST, and AST groups
also underwent RP. By definition, no one in the RP group
received brachytherapy. Brachytherapy was used in 15%22% of the other groups. High dose-rate brachytherapy
was used in 3% and 5% of men in the EBRT and EBRT
þ AST groups, respectively, and was rare in the other
groups. Thermal ablation and cryotherapy were rare in all
groups (<1% in most cases).
Unadjusted Cumulative Incidence of Hip
or Distal Forearm Fracture
The cumulative incidence of hip fracture at 10 years was
2.6% in men undergoing RP and 8.4% in men undergoing EBRT (P < .001; Fig. 2a and Table 1). The addition of AST (mean, 11 monthly AST doses) to EBRT
slightly increase the risk of hip fracture above that with
EBRT alone (8.7% vs 8.4%, P ¼ .014). Hip fracture risk
was highest in those managed with AST alone (16.2%;
mean, 19 monthly AST doses). Except for EBRT versus
EBRT þ AST, all other pair-wise comparisons by logrank test (ie, EBRT vs RP, EBRT vs AST, AST vs RP,
AST vs EBRT þ AST, and RP vs EBRT þ AST) were
statistically significant at P < .0001.
The 10-year incidence of distal forearm fracture was
1.6% for men treated with either RP or EBRT (P ¼
.6313) but was 2.5% in those undergoing EBRT þ AST
and was 4.4% in those on AST (Fig. 2b and Table 1).
Except for EBRT versus RP, all other pair-wise comparisons by log-rank test (ie, EBRT vs AST, EBRT vs EBRT
þ AST, AST vs RP, AST vs EBRT þ AST, and RP vs
EBRT þ AST) were statistically significant at P < .002.
Multivariate-Adjusted Cox Models
After we controlled for measurable confounding variables,
men managed with EBRT were at a 76% increased risk of
hip fracture compared with men managed with RP (HR,
1.76; 95% CI, 1.38-2.40) but at no increased risk of distal
forearm fracture (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.36-1.78) (Fig. 3
and Table 2). EBRT þ AST increased the risk of hip fracture by 145% relative to RP (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.883.19) and increased the risk of distal forearm fracture by

Cancer

43% relative to RP (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.97-2.10).
Finally, AST tripled the risk of hip fracture (HR, 2.97;
95% CI, 2.32-3.80) and doubled the risk of distal forearm
fracture (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.43-2.85). EBRT þ AST
increased the risk of hip fracture by 40% compared with
EBRT alone (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.17-1.68). Other factors associated with hip and distal forearm fracture
included age, comorbidities, race, and a baseline diagnosis
of osteoporosis (see Table 2 for details). Year of diagnosis
was associated with hip fracture but not distal forearm
fracture. There was no change in the hazard ratio of hip or
distal forearm fracture associated with the various treatment groups when patients who received brachytherapy,
cryotherapy, or thermal ablation were excluded or censored at the time of therapy rather than included. The
number of patients needed to treat to result in 1 hip fracture during 10 years was 51 (95% CI, 31-103).

DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated that 3-D conformal pelvic EBRT
increases the risk of hip fracture by 76% in men aged older
than 65 years who are being treated for prostate cancer. To
analyze the site-specific risk modification of the EBRT, we
also tested the effect of EBRT on the risk of fall-related
fractures to bones outside the radiation field, specifically
distal forearm fracture. Indeed, we show that whereas
EBRT increased the risk of hip fracture, it did not increase
the risk of distal forearm fracture. As reference points, the
added hip fracture risk due to EBRT treatment is similar in
scale to the added risk from a 7-year increase in age (HR,
1.097 per year); or having a Charlson comorbidity score of
2 versus a score of 0 in our model, the risk imparted by a
baseline diagnosis of osteoporosis; or the increased risk
others have shown due to being a current smoker versus a
never smoker.6 In absolute risk terms, 51 men need to be
treated with EBRT to induce 1 hip fracture during 10 years
of follow-up. Given that more than 28% of the nearly
200,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer each year
receive EBRT, 3-D conformal EBRT may be linked to
approximately 1000 hip fractures each year.
We have previously shown that pelvic EBRT is a significant risk factor for hip fractures but not other fractures
in women with gynecologic and colorectal malignancies.5
Similarly, the Stockholm trial of short-course radiotherapy for rectal cancer resulted in a doubling of fracture incidence in the radiated group for both men and women.18
The bony pelvis lies in close proximity to genitourinary
pelvic organs and their lymphatics. Therefore, when

radiation is used to treat the prostate and/or the pelvic
lymph nodes, nearby bony structures are also irradiated.
Radiation damage occurs in the bone matrix, at the
cellular level and at the vascular level.7 Radiation can lead
to death of osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, resulting in a reduction in bone matrix production. In addition,
radiation damage to the vascular supply to the bone may
lead to further bone loss.9 Radiotherapy has been associated with fractures of the femur, pubic rami and pubic
symphysis, acetabular failure, and avascular necrosis of the
hip.8,9,19 Adding to the complexity of the problem, fractures after radiotherapy are more difficult to treat; hip
replacement after radiotherapy is associated with an
increased risk of infection and malfunction.8,20
This study did not analyze the association between
IMRT and hip fractures. Prostate IMRT use has increased
greatly over the last decade since it was first approved for

payment by Medicare in 2002. Whereas some of the 3-D
conformal EBRT beams pass through the hip en route to
the prostate (Fig. 4), IMRT can allow planners to decrease
the dose to the hip or completely avoid the hip when necessary without compromising dose to the prostate or increasing scatter to the rectum and bladder.21 This may create a
lower risk for hip fracture with IMRT. However, we did
not include IMRT in this analysis because it was introduced late in our study period and because our Medicare
claims follow-up would have been too short (3-4 years) to
measure the long-term risk of hip fracture in this group.
AST is known to increase the risk of fractures.22
Because EBRT þ AST combination therapy in high-risk
prostate cancer is known to improve survival compared
with either treatment alone,13,14,16 we were interested in
the combined effect of these modalities on the risk of hip
fracture. As all cancer therapy should be aimed at balancing benefits and risks, an examination of the risk of combination therapy is important. As expected, hip and
distal forearm fracture risk was highest in the group
treated with AST alone (mean, 19 monthly doses).
Although the addition of short course AST to EBRT
(mean, 11 monthly doses) did increase the risk of hip
fracture by 40% compared with EBRT alone, the added
effect of AST was not as dramatic as that seen at the
higher number of doses used with AST monotherapy.
Given that current trial evidence favors 36 months over
6 months of AST when combined with EBRT,14 it
would be interesting to know how more AST doses affect
hip fracture risk in the EBRT þ AST group. However, a
low number of events (hip fractures) in each group after
stratification by the number of AST doses prevented us
from investigating for such a dose-response relation.

Certain limitations deserve mention. As our findings are based on a population of men aged >65 years,
conclusions may not be applicable in younger patients.
Claims-based research can be an inexact measure of
minor events; however, hip fracture nearly always results
in acute hospitalization and claims-based methods have
been shown to be valid in such disease models.23 It may
be argued that the older age and higher number of
comorbidities of our EBRT-treated cohort are evidence
that men who select EBRT are generally more ill and at
higher baseline risk for hip fracture. We have controlled
for such a selection bias in 2 ways. First we demonstrate
that EBRT-treated patients were not at higher risk for
distal forearm fractures. In a way, distal forearm fracture
serves as an internal control—if the increase in hip fracture risk seen in the EBRT-treated men was due to selection bias then one would expect their risk of distal
forearm fracture to have been higher too. Second, our
multivariate model demonstrates that after controlling
for these other risk factors (eg, age and comorbidities),
EBRT still increases the risk of hip but not distal forearm
fracture. Of note, there may be residual confounding due
to differences in the prevalence of risk factors that we
were not able to measure such as patient weight, smoking,
glucocorticoid therapy, alcohol use, and radiation dose to
the hip—some of these risk factors may be correlated
with the receipt of EBRT. Finally, we were able to
exclude metastatic disease only through 6 months after
diagnosis. Should new bony metastases occur after 6
months, these may result in fracture. This may confound
measurement of our outcome when the likelihood of
delayed metastatic disease differs between RP and EBRTtreated men. We controlled for the risk of confounding
due to metastases by excluding men who initiated AST or
underwent orchiectomy more than 6 months after diagnosis. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that
even among men with advanced prostate cancer managed
with AST, only 7%-16% of fractures are due to metastases.24,25 Randomized studies would be needed to confirm
these findings. Such studies should have extended followup (10 years) and be of sufficient size to be powered to
detect a difference in events that occur in <10% of men.
These studies should control for the risk factors we were
unable to directly measure.
Conclusion
In men with prostate cancer, pelvic 3-D conformal EBRT
is associated with a 76% increase in the risk of hip fracture. This risk is slightly increased further by the addition

of short-course AST to EBRT. This risk associated with
EBRT is site-specific as no increase in the risk of fallrelated fractures outside the radiation field is seen. An
assessment of baseline bone health may prove useful in
men considering EBRT.
