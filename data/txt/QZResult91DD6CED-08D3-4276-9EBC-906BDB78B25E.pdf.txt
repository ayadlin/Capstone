ABSTRACT
Long-term outcome of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC)
remains poor as a result of recurrence and the emergence of drug resistance.
Almost all the patients were given the same platinum-based chemotherapy after
debulking surgery even though some of them are naturally resistant to the first-line
chemotherapy. No method could verify this part of patients right after the surgery
currently. In this study, we used 156 paraffin-embedded high-grade HGSOC specimens
for immunohistochemical analysis with 37 immunology markers, and association
between the expression levels of these markers and the chemoresponse were
evaluated. A support vector machine (SVM)-based HGSOC prognostic classifier was
then established, and was validated by a 95-patient independent cohort. The classifier
was strongly predictive of chemotherapy resistance, and divided patients into
low- and high-risk groups with significant differences progression-free survival (PFS)
and overall survival (OS). This classifier may provide a potential way to predict the
chemotherapy resistance of HGSOC right after the surgery, and then allow clinicians
to make optimal clinical decision for those potentially chemoresistant patients. The
potential clinical application of this classifier will benefit those patients with primary
drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION

HGSOC is highly heterogeneous. Conventional
prognostic features such as patient age, International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)
stage, histological grade, and initial surgery results
are insufficient to capture individual variations in
chemoresponse and prognosis. All patients receive
the same regimen regardless of their chemoresponse.
Therefore, it is important to develop methods that can
identify patients who may be resistant to traditional
platinum-based chemotherapy and then redirect them to

Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is the fifth
leading cause of cancer death in women [1]. The 5-year
survival rates for late-stage EOC were < 10% between
2004 and 2008 [2]. Long-term outcome remains poor as a
result of recurrence and the emergence of drug resistance
after original debulking surgery and chemotherapy,
especially for the high-grade serous epithelial ovarian
carcinoma (HGSOC).

alternative, potentially more efficacious, chemotherapeutic
agents (e.g., topotecan) or radiation therapy [3], which
may help to improve their overall survivalts.
Molecular prognostic markers could potentially be
represented by changes in gene copy number, mRNA and
protein expression levels. For example, large-scale RNA
expression profiling has been used to screen molecular
markers associated with response to chemotherapy
and prognosis in ovarian carcinomas [4–7]. However,
mRNA expression detection generally requires fresh
or frozen tissue that must be microdissected to remove
associated non-tumor tissue that may attenuate the gene
expression signature of the tumor. Furthermore, mRNA
expression was not always correlated with protein
levels [8]. In the clinical setting, immunohistochemistry
(IHC) remains the most robust and widespread means
to evaluate protein abundance in the neoplastic cells
or stromal cells, since it only need paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tumor tissues that are routinely prepared in
medical practice and are easy to store. Many studies
have reported the assessment of single IHC markers for
prognosis in ovarian cancer [9–13], but no consistent
results have been obtained. We hypothesised that the
value of prognostic predictors would be greatly enhanced
by using a cluster of specific features, including multiple
IHC markers. Support-vector machine (SVM) is a stateof-the-art classification algorithm that can take a small
subset of highly discriminating genes to build extremely
reliable cancer classifiers. This approach has not yet
been applied to HGEOC. In this study, we developed a
SVM-based prognostic classifier to predict the
chemotherapy response of HGSOC which provides a
more accurate measurement of chemotherapy response
than is possible through traditional clinical means.

ROC curves for traditional clinicopathological
prognostic factors, including age, and clinical stage,
grade, residual tumor volume as well as each individual
molecular marker and the HGSOC-SVM classifier in
both the testing and validation cohorts sets, are illustrated
in Figure 2. In the testing cohort (n = 56), the HGSOCSVM classifier (AUC = 0.802) outperformed all the other
individual prognostic factors (Figure 2A). The HGSOCSVM classifier was strongly predictive of chemotherapy
resistance (overall accuracy, 83.9%; sensitivity, 94.1%;
specificity, 68.2%). These prognostic associations were
also observed in the independent validation cohort
(n = 95) (AUC = 0.776) (Figure 2B) including prediction
of chemotherapy resistance (overall accuracy, 80.0%;
sensitivity, 86.7%; specificity, 68.6%).
In univariate logistic analysis based on the testing
cohort (Supplementary Table 3), the high-risk group based
on the HGSOC-SVM classifier was highly associated with
chemotherapy resistance (OR = 34.3, 95% CI: 6.35 to
185.24, P < .001). By contrast, there was no significant
difference in chemotherapy resistance by age, histological
grade, clinical stage, or optimal surgery. Similarly,
in the validation cohort, high-risk group according
to the HGSOC-SVM classifier was also the most
important predictive factor for chemotherapy resistance
(OR = 14.18, 95% CI: 5.05 to 39.77, P < .001)
(Supplementary Table 3).

HGSOC-SVM classifier and HGSOC OS and
PFS
In the 56 testing patients, HGSOC-SVM classifier
defined 39 patients as low risk and 17 patients as high
risk. OS differed significantly between low- and highrisk patients (median OS: 50.0 months, 95%CI: 41.8 to
53.5 months vs. 27 months, 95%CI: 19.5 to 35.2 months,
P < .001) (Figure 3A). In the validation cohort of 95
patients, the HGSOC-SVM classifier was used to define 63
patients as low risk and 32 patients as high risk. Again, the
OS differed strikingly between low- and high-risk patients
(P = 0.017) (Figure 3B). PFS differed significantly
between low- and high-risk patients in both the 56 testing
patients (median PFS: 24.0 months, 95% CI: 19.1 to
28.9 months vs. median PFS: 11 months, 95% CI: 6.2
to 15.8 months, P < .001) (Figure 3C) and 95 patients
of the independent validation cohort (median PFS: 23.0
months, 95% CI: 16.4 to 29.6 months vs. median PFS:
14 months, 95% CI: 11.8 to 16.2 months, P < .001)
(Figure 3D). Univariate associations of the HGSOC-SVM
classifier, clinicopathological parameters, and expression
of each of the 6 immunological markers with OS and
PFS in the 56 testing patients and in the 95 patients from
validation cohort are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Only the

Patient characteristics and components of
HGSOC-SVM classifier
Table 1 shows the demographic, clinical, and
tumor characteristics of the patients in the discovery and
validation cohorts. There was no significant difference
in clinical or tumor characteristics between the training
and validation cohorts. Moreover, we find that only the
residual tumor (> 1 cm) is associated with chemotherapy
resistance in validation cohort (Supplementary Table 1).
On the basis of SVM-RFE analysis of the 100 cases of
the training set, the final HGSOC-SVM classifier integrated
one clinicopathologic feature (optimal debunking surgery)
and expression of 6 proteins, BRCA2, E-Cadherin, P53,
BRCA1, p-AKT, Dicer1, as critical factors. Representative
IHC staining for these six SVM-RFE selected markers in
HGSOC tumor tissues is shown in Figure 1. Raw data was
provided as the Supplementary Table 2.

[14, 15]. Immunological biomarkers may have superior
prediction capacity. Many studies have reported
the value of single prognostic immunomarkers in
ovarian cancer, but no consistent results have been
obtained [9–13].
To improve the prognostic predictive value of
individual genes, supervised methods, such as decision
trees, artificial neural network, could be used to combine
independently informative markers to improve predict
values [16–18]. SVM is one of the most classic supervised
learning algorithms, useful for recognizing subtle
patterns in complex datasets. The algorithm performs
discriminative classification, learning by example to
predict the classifications of previously unclassified

data. Compared with other machine learning algorithms,
SVM is well suited to managing high-dimensional data
in limited numbers of training samples. Through the
recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique, SVM
models are also effective for discovering informative
features or attributes from a large number of candidate
features. In SVM-RFE analysis, the SVM framework
was used to evaluate all the markers collectively with
the least important marker first identified by the SVM
subsequently eliminated. This process is repeated until
only one marker is left. SVM-RFE is especially useful to
determine the independent contribution of each marker
for model performance. Many studies have reported
that the combination of gene expression and clinical
data leads to better classifiers for predicting a patients’
outcome. Thus, SVM model is appropriate for integrate
clinicopathologic features with predominant genes
to predict the outcome of patients. In this study, our
HGSOC-SVM classifier integrated optimal surgery and
expression of six proteins (BRCA2, E-Cadherin, P53,
BRCA1, p-AKT and Dicer1). The genes identified in this
SVM classifier are in commonly deregulated pathways
in ovarian cancer [14, 19, 20]. BRCA1/BRCA2, P53, the
EMT phenotype (particularly E-Cadherin expression)
and Dicer1 expression have independently been reported
as a prognostic factors for chemotherapy resistance and
survival of women with ovarian carcinoma [19–24].
We also have reported that higher BRCA1 expression is
associated with chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer patients
[25], and ovarian cancer patients with BRCA dysfunction
tend to have a better outcome [11]. What’s more, these
markers also hold considerable promise as therapeutic
targets. Agents targeting p53, p-AKT are currently under
investigation in clinical trials. Many studies have shown
that tumors with BRCA1/BRCA2 dysfunction are highly
responsive to PARP inhibitors [26]. Our results indicate
that when each of these molecules individually in HGSOC
was weakly associated with chemoresistance, PFS
and OS, the HGSOC-SVM classifier was substantially
stronger than any single component. Thus, HGSOC-SVM
classifier was able to select the most informative factors
that contributed independently and collectively to the
prediction of HGSOC prognosis.
The study has a few limitations. Although we
validated our findings in an independent cohort, more
samples from multicenter will be needed to strengthen
our results in the future, which may increase sensitivity
and specificity. Additionally, we chose candidate
proteins based on published studies, not whole-genome
analyses, and thus we cannot exclude the possibility of
better models comprising other molecular biomarkers.
Finally, our results are based on retrospective data, we
need more prospective validation to gain the possibility
that this method could help clinical decision making and
improving outcome for those potentially chemoresistant
patients.

In summary, we have developed an SVM-based
prognostic method to predict chemotherapy response in
ovarian cancer patients; this method has high sensitivity
and specificity, with high positive and negative predictive
value. This HGSOC-SVM classifier predicts the
chemoresponse, PFS and OS of patients better than any
other clinical parameters. Although further validation is
necessary, this prognostic strategy may allow clinicians
to select the most appropriate therapies, apart from the
standard paclitaxel and cisplatin approach, for individual
ovarian cancer patients in advance, especially potentially
chemoresistant patients.

METHODS
Patient selection
With the approval and support of the Ethics/
Institutional Review Board of Tongji Hospital and Hubei
Cancer Hospital (Wuhan, Hubei Province, China), HGSOC
patients with FIGO stage IIIC or IV were identified. All
patients were primary, biopsy-confirmed HGSOC who
underwent debulking surgery and subsequent platinum/
taxane-based chemotherapy. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients. We enrolled two independent
sets of HGSOC patients, including a discovery cohort
of 156 patients diagnosed between October 2001 and
July 2009 at Tongji hospital and a validation cohort of
95 patients with HGSOC diagnosed between October
2009 and December 2012 at Tongji Hospital and Hubei
Cancer Hospital. Clinical features are listed in Table 1.
Follow-up information was updated in Jun 2014
through the patients’ medical records and telephone based
follow-up review. Chemotherapy resistance or sensitivity
was defined as tumor relapse/progression within 6 months
or 6 months after completion of prior platinum-based
chemotherapy, respectively. Primary therapy response
was defined as response evaluation criteria in solid tumors
(RECIST). Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated
from time of surgery to time of progression or recurrence.
Optimal debulking was defined as when residual tumors
were ≤ 1 cm.

Tissue microarray construction and IHC
After review of HE-stained sections, three 1.5 mm
cores were identified from the most representative areas
of tumor tissue and re-embedded into tissue microarray
blocks with a Manual Tissue Microarrayer (Beecher
Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). Array blocks were
sectioned to produce 4 μm sections.
Candidate protein markers used to build new
prognostic classifiers in this study were selected from
previous literatures, and involved in different aspects
of chemotherapy resistance of HGSOC, including ABC
transporter (LRP, MRP1, MRP2, ABCA1, SLC31A1),

BRCA1, Rad51, BRCA2, PARP1, 53BP1), cell cycle
(Cyclin D1, CDK1, Ki67, Cyclin E1, P21WAF1,
P27kip1), apoptosis (BAX, BCL-2, HSP27), epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) (E-cadherin, Vimentin,
transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β1], β-catenin), protooncogenes (MYC, FAK, HER2, EGFR, p-AKT), cancer
stem cell marker (ALDH1, OCT4), ROS detoxification
(SOD1, GSTP1), MicroRNA processing (Dicer1) and
tumor suppressor (P53, PTEN) genes. IHC staining
was performed according to standard procedures [27].
The information of these biomarkers is summarized in
Supplementary Table 4. Appropriately selected positivecontrol samples were used according to the manufacturers’
instructions and included in each batch. For a negativecontrol samples were processed as per the standard
protocol but without the primary antibodies from the
dilution buffer.

Before training, all continuous data were
preprocessed by standardizing to zero mean and unit
variance. The same offset and scaling were applied to
the test data. We adopted the SVM-recursive-featureelimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm for feature selection.
The radial basis function kernel was used, since our
classification problem was nonlinear. During the training
phase, 10-fold cross validation was used to determine
the optimal values of the kernel parameter a and the
regularization parameter C with a 10 × 10 grid search in
the region −10 < log2 a < 10 and −10 < log2 C < 10, and
step size of log21 . This algorithm is performed 40 times,
and each time, one feature subset is excluded. During the
training, we evaluated the performance of SVM using
10-fold cross validation error. After the feature subset with
the best 10-fold cross validation performance was selected,
we predicted the labels of tested and validation samples
and recorded the actual performance of the trained SVM
models. The programs were coded with Matlab software
(MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).

IHC scoring
Tissue samples were scored manually using methods
previously described [17]. Briefly, the aggregate score is
the average of the score of tumor-cell staining multiplied
by the score of staining intensity. Tumor-cell staining was
assigned a score using a semi-quantitative five-category
grading system: 0, no tumor-cell staining; 1, 1–10%
tumor-cell staining; 2, 11–25% tumor-cell staining; 3,
26–50% tumor-cell staining; 4, 51–75% tumor-cell
staining; and 5, > 75% tumor-cell staining. Staining
intensity was assigned a score using a semi-quantitative
four-category grading system: 0, no staining; 1, weak
staining; 2, moderate staining; and 3, strong staining.
Every core was assessed individually and the mean of the
three readings was calculated for every case. The pattern
of staining (cytoplasmic, membranous, nuclear) was also
described in each case. Two trained histopathologists
(Dr Su and Dr Li) blinded to clinical data scored all cases
and a concordant score was obtained for 85.2% of the
cases. A consensus score was recorded for the 14.8% of
cases with a discordant score.

Statistical analysis
Differences in patient characteristics between
different groups were tested with Pearson χ2 test. To
identify the association between all features with
chemotherapy resistance, univariate Logistic regression
was performed. Survival curves were estimated by
the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between
survival curves were compared by the log-rank
test. Univariate analyses of prognostic factors were
performed with Cox proportional hazards regression
modeling. In Logistic and Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis, all immunological features were
dichotomized according to cutoff values based on
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. A
significant difference was defined as a P value of ≤ .05
from a two-tailed test. All statistical analyses were
performed with SPSS 16.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA).

Introduction of SVM and details of experiments

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDINGS

SVM was used to predict whether a patient
would have chemotherapy-resistant HGSOC based on
clinicopathological features and immunomarkers. We
performed a set of experiments in the discovery cohort
of 156 HGSOC patients. And this cohort was further
randomly subdivided into 100 patients for SVM training,
and 56 for testing. To make an accurate assessment of
the model, we re-enrolled an independent cohort of 95
patients in accordance with the modeling standards. These
patients were input into the model as a double-blind test
set to evaluate and calculate the sensitivity and specificity
of the model. (Supplementary Figure 1)
