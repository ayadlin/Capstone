ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults. Because of
molecular and cellular heterogeneity, high proliferation rate and significant invasive
ability, prognosis of patients is poor. Recent therapeutic advances increased median
overall survival but tumor recurrence remains inevitable. In this context, we used
a high throughput screening approach to bring out novel compounds with antiproliferative and anti-migratory properties for glioblastoma treatment. Screening
of the Prestwick chemical library® of 1120 molecules identified proscillaridin A, a
cardiac glycoside inhibitor of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, with most significant effects
on glioblastoma cell lines. In vitro effects of proscillaridin A were evaluated on GBM6
and GBM9 stem-like cell lines and on U87-MG and U251-MG cell lines. We showed
that proscillaridin A displayed cytotoxic properties, triggered cell death, induced G2/M
phase blockade in all the glioblastoma cell lines and impaired GBM stem self-renewal
capacity even at low concentrations. Heterotopic and orthotopic xenotransplantations
were used to confirm in vivo anticancer effects of proscillaridin A that both controls
xenograft growth and improves mice survival. Altogether, results suggest that
proscillaridin A is a promising candidate as cancer therapies in glioblastoma. This
sustains previous reports showing that cardiac glycosides act as anticancer drugs in
other cancers.

GBM remain with poor prognosis and require new
therapeutic approaches.
GBM show a high proliferation rate and invasive
properties which are the major causes of recurrence.
In addition, GBM are highly heterogeneous. Indeed,
molecular characterization of these tumors allowed
the identification of gene expression-based molecular
classifications into four subtypes: proneural, neural,
classical and mesenchymal, which seemed to present
distinct outcome [4, 5]. GBM are also heterogeneous
regarding treatment response and up to now the MGMT
promoter methylation status remains the best biomarker
for response to temozolomide [6]. At last, heterogeneity is

INTRODUCTION
Gliomas are the most common primary brain
tumors in adults [1]. Among them, glioblastomas (GBM)
represent the ultimate grade of malignancy and is one of
the most aggressive cancers with a median overall survival
(OS) of about 15 months after surgical resection followed
by radiotherapy and temozolomide (concomitant then
adjuvant) which is the standard of care [2]. More recently,
two larger randomized phase III trials (AVAglio and
RTOG 0825), which aimed to compare anti-angiogenic
therapy (bevacizumab) with standard of care, failed to
demonstrate significant OS improvement [3]. Therefore,

also recorded regarding cell composition, since GBM may
derive from cancer stem cells that are mainly involved in
gliomagenesis, treatment resistance, invasion and thus
tumor recurrence [7–11]. Therefore, identification of new
therapies should take into account GBM molecular and
cellular heterogeneity.
In order to find novel anticancer compounds, we
have first screened the Prestwick chemical library® to
find molecules with anti-proliferative and anti-migratory
properties towards two human primary GBM stem cell
lines, GBM6 and GBM9, previously established and
characterized in our laboratory [11, 12]. They represent
two appropriate study models of GBM that differed in
their cellular composition, displayed specific molecular
signature and strikingly differed in their in vitro
behavior. Indeed, GBM6 cells were highly migratory
whereas GBM9 cells exhibited much lower migratory
capacities but a higher proliferation rate. Moreover, they
displayed distinct in vivo growth pattern [11, 12]. The
screening allowed to select the best candidate molecule,
proscillaridin A, a cardiac glycoside inhibitor of the Na+/K+
adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) pump. Na+/K+ ATPase
is a transmembrane protein that catalyzes the active
transport of Na+ and K+. In addition, it may participate to
signal transduction complexes [13]. Structurally, Na+/K+
ATPase is a heterodimer of a catalytic α-subunit and a
glycosylated β-subunit. The α-subunit has binding sites for
ATP, Na+, K+ and cardiac glycosides. Literature reported
that α1 subunit was preferentially expressed in glial cells
[14] and that an increase in the α1 subunit level enhanced
sensitivity to cardiac glycosides [15]. Here, we analyzed
the expression of Na+/K+ ATPase α1 subunit, known as
the putative target of proscillaridin A, in a series of GBM
human samples and we confirmed its expression in our
GBM cell line models. In a second step, we analyzed the
in vitro and in vivo effects of proscillaridin A. We showed
that proscillaridin A induced apoptosis, decreased cell
proliferation by blocking cell cycle at the G2/M phase in
all GBM cell lines. In addition, proscillaridin A impaired
in vitro GBM stem cells self-renewal capacity, reduced
tumor growth and improved mice survival in vivo.

cardiotonic agents (strophantin octahydrate, digoxin,
proscillaridin A and strophantidin) (data not shown). To
better select the candidates, the 8 molecules were tested
at 0.05 µM. Emetine dihydrochloride, proscillaridin A and
strophantidin showed the most significant effect on both
GBM6 migration and GBM9 proliferation rates (p<0.05)
(Fig. 1B and C). According to these results and to previous
relevant studies [16-18], we chose to further analyze only
proscillaridin A (Fig. 1D) in vitro as well as in vivo on
GBM tumor growth.

Expression of Na+/K+ ATPase α1 subunit
(ATP1A1)
First, we measured by real-time quantitative
PCR (RT-qPCR) the expression of ATP1A1 in a
series of frozen human GBM samples (n = 26). The
median expression level was 87.8 (IQR [71.7 – 106.3])
showing a widespread expression in the series
despite an inter-individual variability (Fig. 2A). Prior
to analyzing the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumoral
effects of proscillaridin A on our GBM models we
also analyzed the expression of ATP1A1 in GBM6,
GBM9, U87-MG and U251-MG cell lines. The median
expression level was 103.20 (IQR [74.32 – 108.86]),
66.95 (IQR [53.45 – 86.85]), 91.26 (IQR [76.06 – 105.20])
and 143.31 (IQR [139.65 – 180.41]) respectively (Fig. 2A).
We confirmed that the ATP1A1 was expressed in all GBM
cell lines with expression variations from one cell line to
another in accordance to GBM samples results. Therefore,
these 4 GBM cell lines represent appropriate models for the
study of anti-tumoral effect of proscillaridin A on GBM.

Cytotoxic effect of proscillaridin A and
consequences on cell cycle
We evaluated the cytotoxic effect of proscillaridin
A on GBM6, GBM9, U87-MG and U251-MG GBM cell
lines by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, the cardiac
glycoside had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell
survival. IC50 (concentration required to inhibit 50% of cell
viability) values were 4 +/- 6 nM for GBM6, 3 +/- 5 nM
for GBM9, 2 +/- 4 nM for U87-MG and 3 +/- 5 nM for
U251-MG. Interestingly, these values were much lower
than reported, for example, in breast and pancreatic cancer
cell lines [19, 20]. Moreover, cytotoxic efficacy of other
cardiac glycosides has been reported in some GBM cell
lines [21] and our present results show that proscillaridin
A is the most efficient in GBM.
To further characterize this cytotoxic efficacy, we
measured cell death induction after a 72h treatment with the
respective IC50 of proscillaridin A. Apoptotic (sub G0/G1)
cells confirmed cell death with a significantly increase
in GBM6 (p<0.05), GBM9 (p<0.01), U87-MG (p<0.01)
and U251-MG (p<0.05) cell lines (Fig. 3A). Moreover,
proscillaridin A similarly influences cell cycle progression

RESULTS
Prestwick chemical library® in vitro screening
A synthesis of the procedure is summarized in
Fig. 1A. The 1120 molecules were first tested at 2 µM
and results showed that only 84 had a significant effect
on both migration and proliferation of GBM6 and
GBM9 cells. These 84 molecules were then tested at
0.1 µM and 8 molecules remained significantly efficient
at this concentration. Two of them were anti-mitotic
agents (paclitaxel, colchicin), one was a topoisomerase
I inhibitor (camptothecin), one was a protein synthesis
inhibitor (emetine dihydrochloride) and 4 were

in GBM6 (p<0.01) and GBM9 (p<0.05) cells and tends to
be increased in U87-MG and U251-MG cells. G1 phase
is decreased in U251-MG (p<0.05) cells and tends to be
decreased for the 3 other cell lines. We did not find any
significant effect on S phase. These results suggest that

proscillaridin A (at IC50) blocks cell cycle at the G2/M
phase and increases apoptotic process. As a result of these
proliferation and survival inhibitory effects, the phenotype
of GBM cell populations was highly modified, with a
reduced cell density and a weakened cellular network
(Fig. 3B).

Proscillaridin A impairs GBM stem cell
self-renewal capacity

A total of 29 U87-MG subcutaneous tumors were
also generated, to be treated with proscillaridin A (n = 15)
or vehicle (n = 14), from 2 to 4 weeks after cells injection.
At the end of the experiment, no significant difference was
recorded between control and proscillaridin A treated-mice,
suggesting that the tumors may escape from treatment
probably due to high proliferation rate of U87-MG
cells. New investigations with a different protocol of
treatment (earlier starting time) need to be set up.

We evaluated the stem cell self-renewal capacity
of GBM6 and GBM9 cells using limiting dilution. The
quantification of self-renewal showed a significant
decrease of sphere formation ability for both cell lines
(p=0.002) (Fig. 4A). As a result of this impairment,
many cells exhibited propensity to adhere to plastic plate.
Consequently, GBM6 and GBM9 cell lines adopted a
differentiation phenotype (Fig. 4B).

Proscillaridin A improves survival of
tumor-bearing mice

Proscillaridin A reduces tumor growth in vivo

A total of 38 orthotopic intracranial tumors have
been generated in nude mice after stereotactic injection
of GBM6 (n = 21) or U87-MG (n = 17) cells. Among
them, 11 mice (GBM6) and 10 mice (U87-MG) have
been treated with proscillaridin A. The remaining mice
(10 for GBM6 and 7 for U87-MG) were DMSO controls.
At the end of the experiment, extracted brains have been
sectioned, stained and microscopically analyzed for
the presence of tumor. Tumors were recorded in 15/21
animals injected with GBM6 cell line (71%) and in 15/17
animals implanted with U87-MG cell line (88%). Only
mice bearing tumors were included in survival analyses
(Fig. 6A). Interestingly, proscillaridin A treatment induced
significant survival benefits as compared to vehicle
injection (p<0.05 and p<0.001 for GBM6 and U87-MG
respectively). In GBM6 tumor-bearing mice, median
survival was indeed more than two-times increased,
from 58 days in control mice to 137 days in treated mice
(Table 1). A similar improvement of median survival
was measured in U87-MG bearing mice, from 16.5 days
in control mice to 30 days in treated-ones (Table 2).
For GBM6 tumors, strong differences were observed
between control and treated mice. According to Ki-67
immunohistochemistry, we observed in control mice that
cells migrated throughout the corpus callosum and used
myelinated fibers to invade the brain giving rise to huge
tumors. As expected, when treated with proscillaridin A,
less GBM6 tumor cells were recorded and consequently
they appeared as scattered in the corpus callosum
(Fig. 6B). U87-MG tumors were histologically examined
after hematoxylin/eosin staining. Tight tumors, sharply
demarcated from the brain parenchyma, with irregular
rim were recorded in 4/6 control brains as compared with
3/9 treated-ones, suggesting the anti-migratory property of
proscillaridin A (Fig.6B).

To highlight in vivo anti-tumoral effect of
proscillaridin A on GBM development, we first achieved
preliminary experiments on healthy nude mice in order
to set up a treatment protocol. Briefly, daily doses (range:
0.5–20 mg/kg body weight) were evaluated for 7 days to
exclude lethal doses. In this way, the dose of 7 mg/kg body
weight was determined as the maximum tolerated dose in
mice, and then kept for all the treatments applied in this
study. At that dose, treatment was generally well tolerated
as evidenced by an absence of weight loss or change in
animal well-being as compared with vehicle (Dimethyl
Sulfoxide (DMSO)) -injected mice (data not shown).
For GBM6 subcutaneous tumors, 5 mice were
treated with proscillaridin A and 5 control mice were
injected with vehicle from 4 to 8 weeks after cells
injection. Tumor volumes were recorded every 4 days
(Fig. 5A). At day 5, a difference in tumor volume
was already recorded. After 17 days, and even more
after 21 days, the tumor volume was significantly
decreased by proscillaridin A (p<0.05 and p<0.0001
respectively). At the end of the experiment, average
tumor volume in control mice was 1266 mm3, while
it was of 201 mm3 in treated mice. Tumors were
sectioned and stained either with hematoxylin/eosin
for conventional histology, or with Ki-67 or antiGlial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) antibodies.
As expected, histological examination showed high
cellularity in all GBM6 subcutaneous tumors. Enlarged
intercellular spaces were observed in treated tumors, as
a hallmark of proscillaridin A efficacy (Fig. 5B. a, b).
Accordingly, GBM6 cell proliferation was slowed
in treated tumors, as showed by the decrease in Ki-67
staining. Moreover, the increase in GFAP staining in
proscillaridin A-treated tumors suggested GBM6 cell
differentiation (Fig. 5B. c, d). Electron microscopy
analyses also revealed differences between treated tumors
and control ones (Fig. 5B. e, f). First, they confirmed
the intercellular spaces enlargement in proscillaridin
A-treated tumors (Fig. 5B. f(1)). In addition, treatment
induced chromatin aggregation within nuclei (Fig. 5B.
f(2)) and gliofilaments accumulation (Fig. 5B. f(3)),
indicating ongoing cell death and differentiation
respectively.

DISCUSSION
In this study we have reported that proscillaridin A,
a cardiac glycoside, is cytotoxic for GBM cell lines and
controls tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Proscillaridin
A was the best active compound selected after screening
of the Prestwick chemical library® on GBM6 and GBM9
cell lines which represent two different appropriate

models of human GBM [12]. Proscillaridin A exerts both
anti-proliferative and anti-migratory activities in these
cell lines at a concentration of 0.05 μM. According to
these results and to previous relevant studies [16-18],
we further analyzed only proscillaridin A in vitro as
well as in vivo on GBM tumor growth. In addition to
proscillaridin A, strophantidin, another cardiac glycoside
and emetine dihydrochloride, a protein synthesis inhibitor,
displayed similar properties, but their effects were less
obvious. Interestingly, these compounds were much more
active than temozolomide, the gold standard for GBM
chemotherapy, which had no effect on migration nor
proliferation rate of GBM6 and GBM9 cell lines at 0.1 and
2 μM.
Cardiac glycosides are a class of natural products.
By increasing intracellular calcium, they increase cardiac
contractile force in patients with congestive heart failure
and cardiac arythmias [22–24]. Epidemiological studies
first showed that digitalis could mediate anticancer
effects: patients with breast cancer treated with digitalis
have been found to have a lower death rate compared with
those not treated [25]. A number of cardiac glycosides
have demonstrated in vitro anti-tumor activity against
a range of cancer types, including glioma [26–28].
Interestingly, cytotoxic profiles of seven cardiac
glycosides in primary culture of tumor cells of different
origins (leukaemia, renal cancer and myeloma) revealed
that proscillaridin A was the most potent out of them [29].
We reported here that the four GBM cell lines
studied, either growing as spheres (GBM6 and GBM9) or
as adherent monolayer (U87-MG and U251-MG), were
highly responsive to proscillaridin A. IC50 values indeed
ranged from 2 to 4 nM, concentrations that are even lower
than those used in other cell types studied [29]. Several
mechanisms of cardiac glycosides have been hypothesized
and the most widely accepted involves the ability of
cardiac glycosides to bind to the membrane-bound Na+/K+
ATPase pump [30]. Accordingly to Lefranc et al. [15, 31],
in the present study, RT-qPCR analysis of ATP1A1
expression revealed that a series of GBM human samples
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and our GBM cell lines models commonly expressed
the potential target, although expression level appeared
heterogeneous in tumors as well as in cell lines. Inhibition
of the ion pump activity by cardiac glycosides has been
described to cause an increase in intracellular sodium
concentration and a decrease in intracellular potassium
concentration [30]. Moreover, besides its ion pumping
activities, it is now established that the Na+/K+ ATPase
acts as a scaffold for the assembly of a multiple protein
signaling complexe in caveolae that transmits signal to
various intracellular compartments [16, 32, 33]. Many
different pathways have been suggested to be responsible
for mediating cytotoxic effects of cardiac glycosides, as
including the calcium-dependant activation of caspases
[34], inhibition of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF1α)
synthesis, and interference with signal transduction
pathways such as protein kinase Src, Epidermal Growth
Factor Receptor (EGFR) or p21[17]. Because most GBM
express EGFR [5] and since HIF1α is a marker gene
upregulated upon hypoxia in GBM [35], proscillaridin
A likely influences GBM tumor growth via various
mechanisms.
We have shown that, in vitro, proscillaridin A exerts
a dose-dependent cytotoxicity through both an increase
in GBM cell death and a G2/M phase arrest. Cellular
heterogeneity is a hallmark of GBM. In particular stemlike cells confer chemoresistance and are considered
as the main brake to GBM therapy efficacy [7–11].
Our results showed for the first time that proscillaridin
A impaired GBM stem self-renewal capacity and could
be considered as a promising candidate for GBM
treatment. In accordance, the number of Ki-67 expressing
cells decreased in xenografts after proscillaridin
A administration. We also learnt from in vivo studies that
proscillaridin A induced a differentiation of GBM cells,
as shown by the increase in GFAP expressing cells and
accumulation of gliofilaments. Treatment also induced
cell detachment in vitro and increased size of intercellular
space in vivo. These results are in agreement with previous
results reporting that ouabain, another cardiac glycoside,
10943

Oncotarget

Prestwick chemical library® screening: analysis
of migration and proliferation of GBM6 and
GBM9 cell lines in vitro

induced cell detachment of MDCK cells and that cells
treated with ouabain accumulated in the G2/M phase in
which they were more sensitive to radiation [36].
As a result of its cytotoxic properties, proscillaridin
A was also shown here to be efficient to slow down the
disease progression in vivo. Indeed, treatment inhibited
tumor xenograft growth and increased the overall health
and survival of nude mice implanted with GBM cell lines.
These effects were measured in tumors obtained from two
different cell lines and were observed successfully for
intracranial xenografts whereas they were less obvious for
subcutaneous xenografts.
To conclude, we have shown for the first time
that proscillaridin A, known as a cardiac glycoside, also
acts as a new therapeutic drug in human GBM. This
study supports the proscillaridin A as a potent candidate
for drug repositioning with advantages of toxicity and
pharmacokinetics profiles already known as well as timeand cost-saving [37, 38]. To finish, further investigations
to determine its underlying mechanisms as well as its place
among the therapeutic strategy in GBM are warranted.

The Prestwick chemical library® (Prestwick
Chemical, Illkirch, France) contains 1120 molecules,
100% approved drugs (FDA, EMA and other agencies)
and selected for their safety in humans. The 1120
molecules, all dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in
sterile H2O to 100 μM, were screened in duplicate using
scratch assay and flash-cytometer acquisitions [11]. Both
cell migration and proliferation of GBM6 and GBM9
cells were measured after 3 days in culture on 96-well
black plates (Greiner Bio-One, Courtaboeuf, France)
coated with poly-DL-ornithin. Analyses were performed
using MetaMorph® Software. Molecules were first used
at a concentration of 2 µM. Only molecules reducing
significantly the migration and proliferation of both
GBM6 and GBM9 cells at 2 µM were analyzed at 0.1 µM
and 0.05 µM.

GBM6 (n = 9 samples, passages 75, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83,
84, 85 and 86) and GBM9 (n = 7 samples, passages
80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85 and 86) cell lines, cultured as
floating spheres with serum-free medium supplemented
with EGF and bFGF, U87-MG (n = 6 samples,

Science, Meylan, France) at 37°C for 20  min. One µg
of total RNA was used for reverse transcription using
random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase
as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Cergy Pontoise, France). The ATP1A1
transcript was analyzed by RT-qPCR using a LightCycler®
480 and the LightCycler 480 SYBRGreen I Master
(Roche Applied Science, Meylan, France). Ribosomal
18S and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) were used as reference genes. Forward and
reverse primers for each transcript were designed using
Primer express 3.0 software and are listed below: ATP1A1:
5¢-tcgtcagtatcgtggtggtg-3¢, 5¢-gggcagtaggaaaggaaagc-3¢;
18S:
5¢-ctaccacatccaaggaaggca-3¢,
5¢-tttttcgtcactacctccccg-3¢;
GAPDH:
5¢-caaattccatggcaccgtc-3¢, 5¢-cccactygattttggaggga-3¢.
PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, followed
by 45 cycles of 15s at 95°C and 30s at 65°C, 67°C
and 65°C for ATP1A1, 18S and GAPDH respectively.

Cell lines
GBM6 and GBM9 stem cell lines, established
at our laboratory from 2 different human GBM tumor
samples, exhibited features reminiscent of the clinical
characteristics of the original tumors respectively [11, 12].
These cells were maintained and grown as floating
spheres in serum-free medium supplemented with EGF
and bFGF as previously described. When necessary, cells
were grown in the same medium on 10 μg/ml poly-DLornithin. Under these conditions, they were able to adhere
to the plastic without differentiating [11]. U87-MG and
U251-MG (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville,
MD, USA) were cultured as monolayers in Dubelcco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Life technologies,
Saint Aubin, France) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air.

Tumor samples
Primary human GBM samples were collected at
Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Marseille (AP-HM) and
frozen samples were stored and provided by the AP-HM
tumor bank (authorization number AC-2013-1786).
Tumor specimens were obtained after written consent and
according to a protocol approved by the local institutional
review board and ethics committee. GBM were diagnosed
according to the 2007 WHO classification [1]. Histological
review (DFB) confirmed the neoplastic nature of the tissue
containing at least 60% of tumor tissue and less than 40%
of necrosis.

Efficiencies were calculated from the given slopes in
the LightCycler 480 software using serial dilutions of
human total RNA reference (Stratagene, Massy, France).
The relative expression ratio of the target gene transcript
and reference gene transcripts was calculated as ddCt as
previously described [39]. Quantifications were performed
in triplicate for each sample. Results were expressed in
arbitrary unit, as median and interquartile range (IQR).

DMSO for 72h. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended
into 0.1% trinatriumcitrat-dihydrat pH 7,4, 0,1 % triton
X10 and 100 μg/ml PI for at least 2h on ice. A total of
10 000 events were counted for each sample. Results
were harvested with the CellQuest Pro Software (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software
choosing the Dean-Jet-Fox model analysis.

Self-renewal analysis

Viability assay

Effect of proscillaridin A on self-renewal capacity on
GBM stem cells was evaluated by limiting dilution [40].
GBM6 and GBM9 stem cells were seeded in previously
poly-DL-ornithin coated 6-well plates (150 000 cells/
well) in the presence of 1.5 mL of serum-free medium
supplement with EGF and bFGF. After 24h, cells were
treated with IC50 concentration of proscillaridin A or
DMSO for 72h. At the end of treatment, the supernatant
was removed, cells were harvested, dissociated into single
cells and plated in 96-well plates (1–5 cells/well) with
serum-free medium supplement with EGF and bFGF.
Eight days later, the spheres were counted. The sphere
formation efficacy was calculated as the number of
spheres formed divided by the original number of cells
seeded. Three experiments were performed in duplicate
for each cell line. In addition, 30 000 treated dissociated
cells were also plated in a dish to assess spheres formation
and were photographed 8 days later under an inverted light
microscope (Leica DMI 4000B).

Proscillaridin A (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin
Fallavier, France) was dissolved at 18,8 mM in cell
culture-grade DMSO at a maximum concentration of
0,5% and stored at -20°C until use. Cytotoxic effect
of proscillaridin A on GBM6, GBM9, U87-MG and
U251-MG cell lines was evaluated by assessing cell
metabolic capacity, which reflects viability, using the MTT
method (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide, Sigma-Aldrich). GBM6 and GBM9 were seeded
in previously poly-DL-ornithin-coated 96-well plates
(7500 cells/well). U87-MG and U251-MG were seeded
in 96-well plates (7500 cells/well). After 24h, cells were
treated with serial concentrations of proscillaridin A
(0; 0,01; 0,1; 0,5; 1; 5; 10; 50; 100; 500; 1000 nM) in
200 μl of cell-specific media per well. After 72h treatment,
20 μl of MTT reagent were added to each well and plates
were incubated for 3h at 37°C. The reduced formazan
was dissolved in DMSO and absorbance was measured
at 562 nm with an Elx800 microplate reader (Bio-Tek,
France). The cell viability was expressed as a percentage
as compared to DMSO control cells. A concentration of
proscillaridin A required to inhibit 50% of cell viability
after 72h of drug incubation (IC50) was deduced for each
cell line using CalcuSyn software. The experiments were
carried out 3 times in triplicate.

Subcutaneous injections
All experimental procedures and animal care were
carried out according to a protocol approved by the local
institutional review board and ethics committee and
according to national regulations. Five hundred thousand
of GBM6 cells (passage 72) were subcutaneously
transplanted into the right flank of 6-week-old athymic
nude mice (Harlan France, Gannat, France); a total of
10 mice were injected. Usually, tumors were apparent
from 3 to 5 weeks after injection (as determined using
a vernier caliper and the standard formula tumor
volume = (thickness x length x width) x π / 6). Same
procedure was conducted with 500 000 U87-MG cells
(n = 29 mice). In that case, tumors were apparent from
1 to 2 weeks after injection. As soon as the subcutaneous
tumors reached 2-4 mm3 volume, the mice were
randomized into 2 equivalent groups and given on
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (200 μl bolus) 5 days a week
of either proscillaridin A (7 mg/kg body weight diluted
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) or vehicle (DMSO
diluted in PBS). The tumor size and general clinical status
were recorded every 4 days. After 3 weeks of treatment,
mice were euthanized, tumors excised and rinsed in PBS.
A portion of 1 mm3 was fixed in glutaraldehyde 2.5%.
Then the remaining of the tumor was formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded for histology analysis.

Cell morphology analysis
Briefly, 150 000 cells/well were seeded in a
previously poly-DL-ornithin-coated 6-well plate for
GBM6 and GBM9 cell lines whereas U87-MG and
U251-MG cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates. Cells
were treated with IC50 concentration of proscillaridin
A or DMSO for 72h. Proscillaridin A impact on cell
morphology was examined using an inverted light
microscope (Leica DMI 4000 B).

DNA fragmentation and cell cycle analysis
DNA fragmentation and cell cycle analyses using
flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences, Le Pont
de Claix, France) were performed by propidium iodide
(PI) staining. GBM cells were seeded at 150 000 cells/
well into previously poly-DL-ornithin-coated 6-well plates
(GBM6 and GBM9) or not (U87-MG and U251-MG)
and treated with IC50 concentration of proscillaridin A or

Intracranial injections

A treated cell lines and DMSO control cell lines. Cell
self-renewal capacity was analyzed by the non-parametric
Mann-Whitney test. To compare the mean tumor volume
variations in the two subcutaneously transplanted groups
(vehicle vs proscillaridin A) we performed the analysis
of variance (ANOVA) test, and after confirmation of
normality, the means were compared by the ANOVA posthoc Tukey test. Overall survival curves of intracranial
xenografted mice were obtained according to the KaplanMeier method and compared using the Log-rank test.
All statistical tests were two-sided and the threshold for
statistical significance was p<0.05. Wilcoxon, MannWhitney and ANOVA tests were conducted using the
XLSTAT 2013 software (Addinsoft, Paris, France)
whereas survival analyses were made using the GraphPad
Prism4 software (GraphPad, Inc.)

Six-week-old athymic nude mice were anesthetized
and 50 000 cells of GBM6 or U87-MG cells were
stereotactically injected in the corpus callosum (1 mm
anterior to bregma, -1mm lateral and -2 mm in deep of the
cortex surface) as previously described [11]. Animals were
observed until they fully recovered. A total of 21 mice
were injected for GBM6 cell line and 17 mice were
injected for U87-MG cell line. They were randomized into
2 groups. For GBM6, 11 mice were given on i.p. injection
(200 μl bolus) 5 days a week of proscillaridin A (7 mg/kg
body weight) and 10 mice were treated with the same
volume of vehicle. For U87-MG, 10 mice were treated
with proscillaridin A and 7 mice were treated with vehicle.
According to tumor graft delay, i.p. treatment was started
2 weeks after U87-MG cells injection and 2 months after
GBM6 cells injection. The body weight and clinical status
of mice were recorded every 2 days. Mice were euthanized
when exhibited more than 20% reduction from initial
body weight or significant neurological deficit. Brains
were extracted, fixed in formalin and paraffin-embedded
according to standard procedures.
