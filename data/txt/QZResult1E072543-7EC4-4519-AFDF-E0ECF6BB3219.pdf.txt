ABSTRACT
Several promising targeted-therapeutics for prostate cancer (PCa), primarily
affecting the androgen receptor (AR) and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-pathway, are in
various phases of development. However, despite promise, single-agent inhibitors
targeting the two pathways have not shown long-term benefits, perhaps due
to a complex compensatory cross talk that exists between the two pathways.
Combination therapy has thus been proposed to maximize benefit. We have carried
out a systematic study of two-drug combination effect of MDV3100 (AR antagonist),
BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor), TKI258 (pan RTK inhibitor) and RAD001 (mTOR inhibitor)
using various PCa cell lines. We observed strong synergy when AR-positive cells are
treated with MDV3100 in combination with any one of the PI3K-pathway inhibitors:
TKI258, BKM120, or RAD001. Growth curve based synergy determination combined
with Western blot analysis suggested MDV3100+BKM120 to be the most effective
in inducing cell death in such conditions. In the case of dual targeting of the PI3Kpathway BKM120+TKI258 combination displayed exquisite sensitivity in all the 5
cell lines tested irrespective of androgen sensitivity, (LNCaP, VCaP, 22Rv1, PC3 and
Du145). The effect of blockade with BKM120+TKI258 in PC3 cells was similar to a
combination of BKM120 with chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel.
Taken together, our observation supports earlier observations that a combination
of AR-inhibitor and PI3K-inhibitor is highly synergistic. Furthermore, combining
BKM120 with TKI258 has better synergy than BKM120+RAD001 or RAD001+TKI258
in all the lines, irrespective of androgen sensitivity. Finally, BKM120 also displayed
synergy when combined with chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel. No antagonism however
was observed with any of the drug combinations.

progress to a castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
phase with poor prognosis [2]. Although some CRPCs
respond to chemotherapeutic drugs, like docetaxel
[3] or cabazitaxel [4], the benefit is limited and often
short-lived. Recent studies have cemented earlier
observations that deregulation of androgen-receptor
(AR) signaling and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer
in American men and the second-leading cause of
the approximately 28,000 cancer-related deaths each
year [1]. Although initially responsive to androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT), nearly all metastatic PCa

play important roles in carcinogenesis, progression and
development of resistance [5–7].
The AR-signaling pathway has been the main
therapeutic target for more than 70 years and ADT shows
remarkable beneficial effect in controlling the early phase
of the disease. Studies directed towards understanding the
mechanism of CRPC development identified upregulation
of AR-signaling in more than 60% of CRPCs, either
through overexpression, mutation or AR splice-variant
production [8]. This prompted the development of new
AR-signaling blockers Enzalutamide and Abiraterone,
both of which recently acquired FDA approval [9–12].
Since Enzalutamide directly binds and inhibits AR
function it has also been approved for treatment-naïve
patients [11].
The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway on the other
hand is important for normal growth and survival of the
cell. It has been shown to be upregulated in 30-50% of
all prostate cancers [13]. PTEN alone is lost in more
than 40% of highly lethal CRPCs [14] and around 15%
of primary prostate cancer [7]. Thus, small molecule
inhibitors targeting critical members of this pathway
are in various stages of development or clinical trials,
including BKM120 [15], TKI258 [16] and RAD001 [17].
Whereas BKM120 (a PI3K inhibitor) and RAD001 (an
mTOR inhibitor) directly inhibit key members of the
PI3K-pathway, TKI258 is a pan-receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (targeting FGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, etc) that
has been shown in breast and colorectal cancer models
to act primarily through inhibition of the PI3K-pathway
signaling [18, 19].
Despite the availability of the new targetedchemotherapeutics, treatment of patients is impeded by
the emergence of drug resistance. For instance, CRPC
patients on enzalutamide therapy develop resistance
within 2 years [20] and single agent RAD001 and
BKM120 treatment have failed clinical trials [21, 22].
Remarkably, a crosstalk between the AR- and PI3Kpathway has been established where the loss of AR leads
to upregulation of the PI3K-signaling pathway, suggesting
a need for simultaneous targeting of both the pathways
[23, 24]. Indeed, combination therapy regimens in breast
cancer, another hormone-dependent system, have shown
not only to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce drug
toxicity but also delay drug resistance development [25].
In PCa combined inhibition of AKT (with AZD5363) and
AR (with MDV3100 or bicalutamide) has been shown to
be effective in delaying PCa progression in preclinical
models [26, 27]. However, with several different drugs
targeting different members of the PI3K-signaling
cascade, a robust and facile method of determining the
best synergistic combination is required. Moreover,
determining the nature of interaction of two drugs to be
combined is essential in making therapeutic choices for
the most favorable outcome. Some drug combinations can
be antagonistic and would require more of each drug to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

achieve similar outcomes [28]. Or, they can synergize and
increase each others’ effect thus requiring lower overall
dose and lesser toxicity [29]. Finally, identifying the
critical targeting node in a signaling pathway will enable
designing better combination for complete pathway
inactivation. In the era of precision medicine, identifying
the complex nature of drug interaction will be helpful in
formulating treatment regimens that are appropriate and
likely to prolong remission.
In this study we used an AR antagonist and several
PI3K-pathway inhibitors (Figure 1) targeting various
nodes of the complex signaling pathway and tested their
as single agents or in combination in several prostate
cancer cell lines. The WST-1 assay in combination with
the CompuSyn algorithm and western blot analyses were
utilized to compute and validate the combination indices
(CI) of combined-treatment effect of Enzalutamide
(MDV3100, AR antagonist), Dovitinib (TKI-258,
pan RTK inhibitor), Buparlisib (BKM120, pan PI3K
inhibitor), Everolimus (RAD001, mTOR inhibitor) and
chemotherapy drug Cabazitaxel in different PCa cell lines.
Not only does our data confirm previous observations of
combining AR- and PI3K-pathway inhibition for better
efficacy, it identifies the targeting node on the PI3K axis
for maximal inhibitory effect. Our study also identified
that dual targeting of upstream targets (such as receptor
tyrosine kinases) with an AKT level blockade (with PI3K
inhibitor) is most synergistic.

RESULTS
Single-agent drug treatment
We began by testing the sensitivity of the PCa cell
lines to single-agent treatments. For this, we generated
the dose-response curves and calculated the IC50 values
of single-agent inhibitors in LNCaP (Supplementary
Figure S2), PC3 (Supplementary Figure S3) and 22Rv1
(Supplementary Figure S4) and Table 1. In LNCaP cells,
the IC50 value determined for MDV3100 was relatively
high at around 6.31 μM similar to what has previously
been reported [23, 30]. However, the IC50 values for
TKI258, BKM120 and RAD001 were 3.4μM, 3.23μM and
4.05μM respectively. In the case of PC3 cells, IC50 values
for TKI258, BKM120 and RAD001 were determined
to be 2.57μM, 2.81μM and, 5.46μM respectively. The
increased IC50 in the case of RAD001 is perhaps due to
the inactivation of PTEN in both LNCaP and PC3 cells
(via either frameshift mutation or homozygous deletion,
respectively), which drives constitutive PI3K-pathway
activation. Indeed, 22Rv1 cells, which express wildtype PTEN, have increased sensitivity to RAD001 at
1.57μM and BKM120 at 1.7μM (Supplementary Table
S1 and Supplementary Figure S4), similar to that reported
with CH5132799, another mTOR inhibitor in the same
cell line [31].

To test whether each of the drugs was able to
physiologically inhibit its intended target, western blot
analysis was performed on whole-cell lysates from PCa
cells treated acutely for 1 day with a high concentration
(2xIC50) of the drugs. This treatment was done to exclude
the physiological effect of pathway inhibition (cell death,
altered growth profile, etc) from the direct effect of signaling
block. LNCaP cells treated with MDV3100 displayed
loss of PSA expression, Figure 2 (lane 2). Whereas
BKM120 treatment resulted in almost complete loss of
AKT phosphorylation, the effect was partial with TKI258
treatment, Figure 2 (lanes 3 and 4). Treatment with RAD001
led to the complete loss of S6 phosphorylation without
affecting AKT phosphorylation, Figure 2 (lane 5). Similar
results were observed in other PCa cell lines; VCaP, (Figure
2), PC3, 22Rv1 and Du145 (Figure 4). These observations
are consistent with expected response of downstream
effectors upon the inhibition of upstream targets, Figure 1.

combination had a synergistic or antagonistic effect,
each above-mentioned factor was integrated using the
CompuSyn algorithm and CI values were calculated,
both at Fa 0.5 (50% cell death) and Fa 0.8 (80% cell
death), Table 2. CI values less than 1 denotes synergism
and greater than 1 antagonism. Finally, the fold changes
affected due to the drug-combinations were also
tabulated, Supplementary Table S1.

Targeting both AR and PI3K pathways
simultaneously
The dependency of PCa on AR- and PI3Kpathways provides an ideal therapeutic opportunity for
a combination treatment that inhibits both the pathways
simultaneously. Indeed, when LNCaP cells were treated
with AR antagonist MDV3100 in combination with a
PI3K pathway inhibitor (TKI258, BKM120 or RAD001)
various levels of synergy were observed. The strongest
synergism was observed for MDV3100+RAD001 (CI 0.11),
followed by MDV3100+BKM120 (CI 0.26), and finally
MDV3100+TKI258 (CI 0.33). Remarkably, in the case of
MDV3100+RAD001 treatment, synergy was observed even
at highest concentration with Fa 0.7 and Fa 0.8 points in the
isobologram segregated at the origin, Figure 3i. Moreover,
the CI-Fa plot showed all points to be close to the horizontal
axis at all concentrations, Figure 3h. This was in contrast
to MDV3100+TKI258 combination where at high drug
concentration, the curve tended towards additive (CI =1),
Figure 3b and Table 2. Furthermore, whereas in the case

To identify whether a drug combination was
synergistic, the combination index (CI) of each drug-pair
was calculated. For this, cells were treated with seven
inhibitor combination ratios, taking three concentrations
above, and three below the approximate IC50 value
of each drug as described in the Methods section.
Thereafter, using survival data generated from the WST-1
assays, CI-Fa, isobologram and dose-response plots were
generated for each drug-pair. To identify whether a drug

of MDV3100+RAD001 this translated to a 90 and 19
fold reduction in drug dose for MDV3100 and RAD001
respectively to achieve 50% inhibition as compared to
single-agent treatment, in the case of MDV3100+TKI258
or MDV3100+BKM120, the synergistic effects were
equivalent to a reduction of drug dose by 42 and 7, and
57 and 7 folds respectively, Table 3. Analysis of the doseresponse curves generated upon combining MDV3100 with
TKI258, BKM120 or RAD001 in LNCaP cells (Figure 3,
first column) suggested the best shift to be generated upon
BKM120 or RAD001 combination, Figure 3g. To determine
the best combination between MDV3100+BKM120 and
MDV3100+RAD001, we carried out western blot analysis
upon 1-day treatment with various drug-combinations
at 2x IC50 concentrations. The drug concentration was
chosen to make comparison consistent with single agent
treatment. The level of downstream effector inhibition and
cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase 1 (cPARP1), shown
to be a robust read out for apoptosis [32], upon treatment

was evaluated. Remarkably, contrary to the CI values,
the level of cPARP1 was much higher in cells treated
with MDV3100+BKM120 compared to cells treated with
MDV3100+RAD001, Figure 2 (left, lane 6, 7 and 8). Grown
in charcoal stripped media (to mimic castrate conditions)
also showed similar results, Supplementary Figure S5. This
could be a ramification of acute treatment of the cells, or
perhaps MDV3100+RAD001 induces more of a cytostatic
effect whereas MDV3100+BKM120 induces apoptosis.
Further experiments are required to differentiate between
these two effects. The same effect was observed in the AR
positive cell line VCaP when treated similarly Figure 2
(right, lanes 6,7 and 8). We further validated this observation
in another AR-positive but CRPC cell line 22Rv1, which
expresses a combination of full-length and a splice variant
form of AR that lacks the ligand-binding domain making it
insensitive to anti-androgens [33]. Similar to observations
in LNCaP and VCaP cells, MDV3100+BKM induced
higher levels of cPARP1 in 22Rv1 cells when compared to

MDV3100 or BKM120 alone, Figure 4 (lane 6). However,
we observed a slightly higher level of cell death induced
with the MDV3100+TKI258 combination, Figure 4 (lane
7). Perhaps the cells are still wired, in part, for survival
through the full-length AR signaling pathway and signaling
upstream of PI3K. Taken together, this indicates that
combining MDV3100 with BKM120 is highly synergistic.
This finding is in line with earlier observations where a
combination of MDV3100 with CH5132799 (an AKT
inhibitor) was shown to be effective in delaying resistance
development in preclinical models of PCa [26, 27].

Figure 2 (lane 9, 10). Although both BKM120+TKI258
and BKM120+RAD001 exhibited very similar increases
in cPARP1 levels, in VCaP cells, the level of S6 activation,
only in the case of BKM120+TKI258, was similar to
LNCaP cells treated similarly, Figure 2 (lanes 10, 11).The
increased sensitivity of VCaP cells to BKM120+RAD001
combination is perhaps due to its intact PI3K-signaling
when compared to LNCaP cells that have inactive PTEN
resulting in upregulation of the pathway. The increase
in S6 activation in VCaP cells upon BKM120+RAD001
treatment, when compared to LNCaP cells treated
similarly needs further investigation. Taken together,
however, our experiments suggest BKM120+TKI258 to
be the combination treatment of choice to bring about the
most synergy with complete PI3K pathway inhibition.
We next looked at the effect of drug-combination
in CRPC lines. In the case of PC3 cells,
treatment with BKM120+TKI258, BKM120+RAD001
or TKI258+RAD001 yielded CI value of 0.77, 0.65 and
0.54, respectively (Table 2 and Figure 7), suggesting high
to moderate levels of synergy. However, unlike LNCaP
cells, the CI-Fa plots in PC3 cells displayed a trend towards
additive and beyond, especially at higher Fa values,
Figure 7 (middle column). This was particularly prominent
for the BKM120+TKI258 combination (Figure 7h) and
was reflected in the highest CI (Fa 0.8) value of 1.14
(Table 2). To test if PC3 cells treated with the combination
of BKM120+TKI258 would result in the greatest increase in
cPARP1 levels, as previously observed in LNCaP and VCaP
cells, we carried out western blot analysis upon treatment
with the various drug combinations. As seen in Figure 4
(lanes 5 and 6) for PC3 cells, the most prominent cPARP1
bands observed were from cells treated with combinations
of BKM120+TKI258 or BKM120+RAD001. To test if this
was a consistent trend, we treated two other CRPC cells,
22Rv1 and Du145, both of which do not respond to AR
antagonists. Consistent with results from LNCaP and VCaP
cells, the BKM120+TKI258 combination elicited the
highest amount of PARP cleavage (Figure 4, 22Rv1 lane
9, and Du145 lane 5). Taken together, our CI computation
and biochemical data suggests that in prostate cancer a

Combined targeting of PI3K pathway
More than 49% of the somatic alteration in
metastatic CRPC [6] and around 23% in primary PCa
have been associated directly with the PI3K pathway [7]
underscoring the dependence of PCa on this pathway.
Since the pathway is multi-nodal, identifying the
correct combination is crucial for effective abrogation
of the pathway in relation to PCa. To achieve this we
combined BKM120+TKI258, BKM120+RAD001 and
TKI258+RAD001 and tested their effect on various
PCa cell lines. When LNCaP cells were treated with
combinations of BKM120+TKI258, BKM120+RAD001
or TKI258+RAD001, we observed CI values of 0.20.
0.19 and 0.34, respectively, Table 2. Remarkably, the
CI at Fa 0.8 remained similar to Fa 0.5 in this cell line
for all the combinations, Table 2 and Figure 6 middle
column, suggesting the drugs to be well tolerated for
high drug combinations. However, between the three,
the least amount of synergism was observed for the
TKI258+RAD001 combination, which was confirmed
with western blot analysis where the levels of cPARP
were least, when compared to BKM120+TKI258
BKM120+RAD001 levels, Figure 2 (lane 11). This
was also observed when VCaP cells were treated
similarly. However, whereas in VCaP cells both
BKM120+TKI258 and BKM120+RAD001 combinations
led to increased cPARP1 levels, it was only observed
with the BKM120+TKI258 combination in LNCaP cells,

combination of BKM120+TKI258 is perhaps the most
effective treatment modality to inhibit the PI3K-pathway
resulting in maximum apoptotic response in the tested
conditions.
Drug-antagonism can impair the efficacy of
combination therapy. To further understand the
trend towards antagonism observed in the case of
BKM120+TKI258 combination (Figure 7h) we carried
out a detailed study with increasing drug-concentration
ratios in PC3 cells, Table 4. Although synergy is
evident across most drug-ratios (CI values 0.03-0.89),
it was strongly synergistic at lower concentrations of
BKM120 and TKI258 (green boxes in Table 4). As the
concentration of each drug increased, the synergy of

combined treatment began to decrease with CI values
≥1 (yellow) and, at even higher drug concentrations, the
effect shifted predominantly to antagonism (red). Perhaps
the drug-target complexes are all completely saturated and
thus become a limiting factor, or perhaps the drugs are
somehow interacting with each other. Another possibility
is that these drugs are no longer completely soluble at
such high concentrations, leaving only a fraction of the
drug available to inhibit the intended target. Nevertheless,
this detailed analysis suggests that the effect of drug
combination changes from synergy to antagonism when
drug concentrations are increased. Thus, a careful analysis
is imperative to designing a combination therapy to yield
better response with reduced toxicity.

PC3 cells treated with MDV3100 and BKM120
or RAD001

MDV3100+RAD001 is the same as RAD001 alone, albeit
slightly lower than BKM120 combination, Figure 5b.
Thus, the presence of MDV3100 does not seem to affect
the inhibitory property of BKM120 or RAD001.

Due to the recurrent loss of PTEN in PCa, BKM120,
the inhibitor of PI3K, presents one of the most promising
alternatives for PCa treatments. As mentioned above, the
CI value can change with Fa and might result in reduced
synergy between drugs, especially at high concentrations.
To test whether an antagonistic effect existed between
MDV3100 and BKM120 (as observed with BKM120
and TKI258 in PC3 cell) or MDV3100 and RAD001, we
studied the two-drug combinations in PC3 cells, which
have lost both AR and PTEN expression. The curveshift plot in Figure 5a shows that combining BKM120
with MDV3100 is similar to the effect of BKM120
treatment alone. Similarly, the effect of combining

Effect of combining targeted therapy with
chemotherapy
In addition to testing the combination effect of
targeted therapies, we investigated the combination effect
of chemotherapy drug cabazitaxel with a PI3K-pathway
inhibitor (BKM120, TKI258 or RAD001). Cabazitaxel
is FDA approved drug to treat metastatic hormone
refractory prostate cancer [4, 34]. When LNCaP and
PC3 cells were treated with a PI3K-pathway inhibitor
in combination with Cabazitaxel, comparable levels of

Antagonism (CI > 1, red)
Additive (CI = 1, yellow)
Synergism (CI < 1, green)
synergism were observed in both the cell lines. The CI
values ranged between 0.46-0.74 suggesting moderate
to slight synergism (Table 2). In general, the CI value of
cabazitaxel in combination with a targeted therapy was
higher (less synergistic) than the CI value of two targeted
therapies that included one of the same drugs, Table
2 and Figure 8 and 9(a, d, g). Interestingly, however,
the cabazitaxel+BKM120 combination in LNCaP cells
displayed no trends towards antagonism in the Fa-CI
plot and distinct curve shift in the dose-response plot,
Figure 8e. Intriguingly, in PC3 cells, the combination of
cabazitaxel with BKM120 was more synergistic (CI 0.47)
than BKM120+TKI258 (CI 0.77), Figure 8 and Table 2.
Taken together, this suggests that using the combination
of a PI3K inhibitor, especially BKM120, with cabazitaxel
could have treatment benefit beyond that of using
cabazitaxel alone. Overall, no significant antagonism was
observed with any drug-combination in the PCa cell lines
tested.

such MDV3100 and RAD001 is underway [37]. Other
drugs (such as docetaxel, bicalutamide and ARN509) in
combination with RAD001 are also in various phases of
early clinical trial [37, 38].
Our data suggests that in AR positive conditions
(LNCaP and VCaP cells) the BKM120+MDV3100
combination has the most synergistic effect with the
ability to induce apoptosis. However, early clinical trail
results with BKM120 (inhibitor of PI3K), either alone
or with MDV3100, have not been very encouraging
[22]. This could because the patients on the trial had
already progressed on MDV3100. In this regards, our
data suggests that combining BKM120+MDV3100
as first line therapy would be more efficacious than
MDV3100 alone. The failure of single-agent PI3K
pathway inhibitors suggests the complex and branched
nature of the pathway requires better two-stage targeting
to completely inhibit it. The focus remains at PI3K,
which mediates the activation of AKT, along with mTOR
a major effector of the TORC1 complex downstream
of AKT. In this regard, our data also suggests that a
BKM120+TKI258 combination to be more effective
than BKM120+RAD001, and thus could have beneficial
effect. Although there is an ongoing trail of BEZ235
(a dual PI3K - mTOR inhibitor) in combination with
BKM120 [39], no clinical trial of BKM120+TKI258 in
prostate cancer is being carried out.

DISCUSSION
A complex compensatory crosstalk between the
AR- and PI3K-pathways has been identified, limiting the
success of single-agent therapy targeting the individual
pathways [23, 24, 35]. Indeed clinical trial of single agent
RAD001 in chemotherapy-naïve patients showed only a
moderate response [21], and all patients on MDV3100
develop disease resistance within 2 years [20, 36]. Thus,
a combined treatment with inhibitors targeting the two
pathways could act as a viable alternative [27]. Presently a

Antagonism and development of resistance
Although, at Fa 0.5 (50% cell death), we saw
synergy in all the different combinations, we observed
trends towards antagonism at higher Fa values especially
76190

Oncotarget

in the case of BKM120+TKI258. For better therapeutic
effect a threshold at Fa=0.8 (80% cell death) is most
commonly used when investigating oncogenic drugs [40].
Interestingly, in microbial systems it has been shown
paradoxically that antagonistic drug combinations lead
to a reduction in the evolution of resistance [28, 41–43].
However, such drug-combination studies and their
correlation with resistance-development have not been
explored in cancer. This is of particular interest for PCa
as it is a slow-progressing disease with a median age of
diagnosis of 65 years. Keeping the tumor burden low or
stagnant, with reduced chance of resistance development,
than quick elimination of tumor load with increased
chance of resistance development and compromised
quality of life, could be a viable alternative.

Finally, we found synergistic effect of cabazitaxel
in combination with any of the PI3K-pathway inhibitors,
most prominently with BKM120 (Table 2). Furthermore,
better synergy was observed when MDV3100 was
combined with a PI3K-pathway, than when cabazitaxel
was combined with the same PI3K-pathway inhibitor.
However, similar synergies were observed when twodrugs targeting the PI3K-pathway were used or when a
PI3K-pathway inhibiting drug was used in combination
with cabazitaxel (Table 2). Taken together our study
suggests that addition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR-pathway
inhibition especially at the level of PI3K (with drugs
such as BKM120) to existing therapies can enhance
therapeutic efficacy. The study described here can be used
in conjunction with newer techniques of culturing human

Where CA,x and CB,x are the concentrations of
drug A and drug B in the combination to produce a certain
effect X. ICx,A and ICx,B are the concentrations of drug
A and drug B used as a single agent to produce that same
effect.

Cell viability was assessed using the water-soluble
tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay (Clontech) following
manufacturer’s instructions. 5,000-10,000 cells/well were
plated in a 96-well plate and after the cells had adhered the
culture media was replaced with drug/s-containing media
and cells further incubated for 72 hours. Thereupon, cell
viability was assessed using the WST-1 protocol. The cell
viability data was used to generate IC50 values using Prism
6 (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, USA). Experiments
were always set in triplicates and repeated three times.

Interpreting drug-combination plots
CompuSyn also generates a plot of CI values at
different fraction affected (Fa) levels referred to as Fa-CI plot
or the Chou-Talalay plot, which are widely used to interpret
drug combination effects [40, 45] and Supplementary Figure
S1. A CI value of <0.1 indicates very strong synergism, 0.1–
0.3 strong synergism, 0.3–0.7 synergism, 0.7–0.9 moderate
to slight synergism, 1 nearly additive, 1.1–1.45 slight to
moderate antagonism, 1.45–3.3 antagonism, and >3.3 strong
to very strong antagonism. The relation of CI and Fa is
depicted in Supplementary Figure S1A.
To further study the dose-dependent interaction of
two drugs’ isobolograms, particularly at Fa levels of 50%,
70%, and 80% inhibition were created, Supplementary
Figure S1B. Since the single agents Fa value corresponds
to IC50 value, the 50% isobologram of the combination
provided direct comparison with single agent treatment. The
70% and 80% isobologram represent combination at a high
effect level and have practical implications in therapeutic
oncology [46]. Data points above or below the line of
additivity indicate antagonism or synergism, respectively.
Finally, to study the nature of inhibition with the drug
combinations, a drug-effect-shift analysis of single-agent
and combination was carried out, (Supplementary Figure
S1C) which allowed for a direct comparison in terms of
IC50 equivalents. Here synergy refers to a lowering of IC50
equivalent (left-shift) when compared to single agent curves
on the same plot [47], and Supplementary Figure S1C.

Drug formulations and treatment
Buparlisib (BKM120, cat. S2247), Dovitinib (TKI258, cat. S2269), Everolimus (RAD001, cat. S1120),
Enzalutamide (MDV3100, cat. S1250) and Cabazitaxel (cat.
S3022) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston,
TX, US). All drugs were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and aliquots stored
in −80°C. Experiments were designed such that none of the
inhibitors or inhibitor combinations would completely kill
all the cells in any given experiments. The half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of each drug was
determined by treating cells with a range of 0.012 – 200
μM concentration for three days. For combination studies,
0, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, and 4 times IC50 of each drug and its
combination was used in an array format. For BKM120TKI258 studies in PC3 cells, both the drug concentrations
ranged from 0–50μM in two-fold increments.

Combination effect analysis
The fraction of viable cells remaining after three
days of drug treatment was normalized to DMSO
treated control and plotted against drug concentrations
in the logarithmic scale. IC50 values were calculated by
performing nonlinear regression analysis using Prism6.
Although experiments were set in triplicates and
replicated three times, only one set of representative
data with the greatest best-fit curve was used for the
computation.

Western blot analysis
Prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, 22Rv1,
PC3, and Du145) were seeded in 12-well tissue culture
plates and grown in complete RPMI 1640 media
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine (FBS) and 1%
antibiotic-antimycotic solution (A/A). When cells
reached 80% confluence they were treated with 2xIC50
concentrations of MDV, BKM120, TKI258 or RAD001
alone or in combination for 24 hours. After treatment,
excess media was removed and cells were collected
and washed with 1X PBS after dissociation with 0.25%
trypsin. For serum-starved experiments, LNCaP cells were
first allowed to attach and grow in complete media until
they reached 80% confluence. Cells were then cultured in
phenol red-free RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 5%
charcoal-stripped FBS and 1% A/A solution for 72 hours
prior to treatment with drugs. All cells were maintained
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2
(Heracell™ 150i incubator).

Combination index
The unified theory of using both linear and nonlinear regression analysis, introduced by Chou, was used
to evaluate the synergism, additivity and antagonism
of the combination drug treatment [40]. Combination
index (CI) values were calculated using the CompuSyn
software (CompuSyn Inc., Paramus, NJ)[44] which uses
the equation:
CI =

lysed by passing them five times through a 28G 1/2 needle.
After lysis, the homogenates were centrifuged at 4°C for
