Suboptimal Responses in Chronic
Myeloid Leukemia
Implications and Management Strategies

The high response rates and increased survival associated with imatinib therapy prompted a paradigm shift in the
management of chronic myeloid leukemia. However, 25% to 30% of imatinib-treated patients develop drug resistance
or intolerance, increasing the risk of disease progression and poor prognosis. In 2006, the European LeukemiaNet
proposed criteria to identify patients with a suboptimal response to, or failure associated with, imatinib; these recommendations were updated in 2009. Suboptimal responders represent a unique treatment challenge. Although they
may respond to continued imatinib therapy, their long-term outcomes may not be as favorable as those for optimally
responding patients. Validation studies demonstrated that suboptimal responders are a heterogeneous group, and
that the prognostic implications of suboptimal response vary by time point. There are few data derived from clinical
trials to guide therapeutic decisions for these patients. Clinical trials are currently underway to assess the efficacy of
newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this setting. Identification of suboptimal responders or patients failing treatment
using hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular techniques allows physicians to alter therapy earlier in the treatment

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) afflicts approximately 1.5 per 100,000 individuals in the United States, with an

estimated 5000 new cases diagnosed annually.1,2 The etiology of CML is a chromosomal aberration known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which is created by the reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 (t[9;22][q34;q11]).3
The Ph chromosome leads to the expression of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, an oncogenic fusion protein. BCR-ABL, identified in 1985 as the cause of malignant transformation in Phþ CML,4 served as the target for design of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs).
The first TKI approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Phþ CML in chronic
phase (CML CP) was imatinib (STI571; Gleevec; Novartis, Florham Park, NJ), which quickly replaced interferon (IFN)
alpha as the standard of care. Results from the 6-year follow-up study of the International Randomized Study of Interferon
Plus Ara-C Versus STI571 (IRIS) demonstrated an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 83% and an estimated rate of freedom
from progression (FFP) to advanced disease (accelerated phase [AP] or blast crisis [BC]) of 93%, associated with imatinib
therapy5; results at 8 years confirmed the durability of these responses.6 The newer TKIs, nilotinib (Tasigna, Novartis)
and dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), have been commercially available for >3 years and were
indicated first for patients who developed resistance or intolerance to first-line therapies, including imatinib.7,8 In June
2010 and October 2010, nilotinib and dasatinib, respectively, were FDA approved as first-line therapy for patients with
newly diagnosed CML CP.8 The efficacy of TKIs has extended treatment goals beyond those previously attainable with
IFN-based therapies to include molecular responses. Currently recognized response milestones of treatment are complete
hematologic response (CHR), complete cytogenetic response, major molecular response, and complete molecular
response (or undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts by current technology).9

Review Article

Despite imatinib’s efficacy, 24% of newly diagnosed
CML CP patients treated with imatinib in the IRIS trial
failed to achieve complete cytogenetic response within 18
months of treatment, and 14% discontinued treatment or
crossed over to the IFN-alpha/cytarabine arm.10 To assist
clinicians in determining when a change in therapy may
be needed based on individual patient responses, the European LeukemiaNet defined treatment responses at various time points as failure and suboptimal.11 Patients
classified as experiencing failure would likely benefit from
a change in treatment. Patients experiencing suboptimal
response may benefit from continued therapy; however,
long-term outcomes may not be as favorable as those for
patients achieving milestone responses.11
Treatment failures are relatively straightforward to
identify and treat; the management of suboptimal
responses may be more complex. There is less awareness
of what constitutes suboptimal response, and physicians
may elect to continue imatinib treatment for the duration
of measurable response. Furthermore, there are differences between CML guidelines regarding these defined
responses. The European LeukemiaNet guidelines define
suboptimal response and failure; the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines define target
responses by specific time points. Physicians should carefully monitor each patient’s response to treatment and
identify patients not achieving optimal responses as early
in the treatment course as possible.
Current Monitoring Recommendations
Regularly scheduled monitoring after treatment initiation
may help identify patients at risk of suboptimal response
or failure. CML remission occurs in the sequence CHR,
complete cytogenetic response, major molecular response,
and complete molecular response. Internationally
endorsed guidelines describe the expected response milestones, critical time points, and frequency of
monitoring.9,12,13
Hematologic responses should be assessed every 2
weeks after initiating treatment, until CHR is achieved
and confirmed.9 Bone marrow cytogenetics are recommended at diagnosis, at 3 and 6 months after treatment
initiation, and then every 6 months until complete cytogenetic response is achieved and confirmed. Thereafter,
cytogenetic analysis is reserved for when molecular monitoring is not feasible or for patients exhibiting myelodysplastic features (eg, cytogenetic abnormalities in diploid
cells), suboptimal response, or failure.9 Molecular monitoring of the BCR-ABL transcripts by quantitative real-

1182

time polymerase chain reaction should be conducted
every 3 months until a major molecular response is
achieved and confirmed and at least every 6 months thereafter. Molecular monitoring has the highest sensitivity of
current tests for treatment responses in CML; in clinical
practice, it is typically used once patients have achieved
complete cytogenetic response.14
Defining Suboptimal Responses
Suboptimal responses are defined based on the lack of
achievement of certain response milestones (hematologic,
cytogenetic, and molecular; Table 1) at specific time
points. European LeukemiaNet9 and the European Society for Medical Oncology15 have each defined suboptimal
response to treatment milestones and accompanying treatment recommendations. The definitions were based on
responses at time intervals observed in clinical studies,
including the IRIS trial, and clinical experience.16 European LeukemiaNet and European Society for Medical
Oncology guidelines define suboptimal response as: 1)
less than a CHR at 3 months; 2) less than a partial cytogenetic response at 6 months; 3) less than a complete cytogenetic response at 12 months; 4) less than an major
molecular response at 18 months; or 5) loss of major
molecular response or development of partially imatinibsensitive BCR-ABL mutations at any time (Table 2).9,15
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines
do not define suboptimal response per se; however, treatment recommendations at specified time points after initiating TKI therapy are provided based on the response.17
Clinical Implications of Suboptimal Response
Patients achieving optimal milestone responses have
improved long-term outcomes.5,18-24 Patients with European LeukemiaNet-defined suboptimal response at 6 and
12 months have a worse long-term prognosis than patients
with optimal responses.25,26 The predictive value of
responses varies by time point (eg, responses at 3 and 6
months are qualitatively different from those at 12 and 18
months); these issues are further discussed in the subsequent section. Patients with suboptimal responses have
greater risk of disease progression than optimal responders.18,27-29 Furthermore, patients who have transformed
to AP or BC generally respond poorly to standard treatment and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality.30
In several clinical studies, investigators have applied
the definitions of suboptimal response to treatment outcomes to determine the prognostic significance of these
responses (Table 3). Data for 281 patients with CML CP

participating in clinical trials at The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center were retrospectively analyzed.25 At 6, 12, and 18 months, 4%, 8%, and 50% of
patients, respectively, had suboptimal responses. The outcomes for suboptimal responders varied by time point.
For patients who were suboptimal responders at 6
months, the 4-year EFS and treatment-free survival rates
were significantly worse than those of optimal responders.
Patients with suboptimal response at 12 months showed a
trend toward lower EFS; those with suboptimal response
at 18 months had a treatment-free survival comparable to
optimal responders. The authors concluded that patients
with suboptimal responses generally have worse long-term
outcomes than patients with optimal responses, particularly if the suboptimal response occurs early in treatment.

These findings are supported by an analysis of 224
patients with CML CP treated with imatinib at the Hammersmith Hospital in the United Kingdom (Table 3).26
In this analysis, the prognostic significance of suboptimal
response also varied by time point. Compared with optimal responders, suboptimal responders at 6 and 12
months had significantly lower progression-free survival
(PFS) and probability of complete cytogenetic response,
and suboptimal responders at 12 months had significantly
worse overall survival (OS), but suboptimal responders at
18 months did not have significantly different OS or PFS.
The Italian GIMEMA (Group for Hematological
Malignancies of the Adult) CML Working Party analysis
also evaluated the outcome of patients with European
LeukemiaNet-defined suboptimal response (Table 3).31
Suboptimal responders at 6 and 12 months had significantly lower probability of achieving complete cytogenetic
response, major molecular response, failure-free survival,
and EFS at 5 years than optimal responders; however, OS
was not different between the 2 groups.
The level of initial response also appears to predict
achievement of subsequent responses. In the retrospective
analysis by Alvarado and colleagues at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, no suboptimal responders at 6 months ever achieved major molecular

response, and only 30% achieved complete cytogenetic
response (Table 3).25 Of suboptimal responders at 12
months, 39% and 72% eventually achieved major molecular response and complete cytogenetic response, respectively, resulting in a transformation rate similar to that in
optimal responders but with a higher probability of an
event (26% vs 8%, respectively), including loss of CHR
or major cytogenetic response, progression to AP/BC, or
death from any cause. Among suboptimal responders at
18 months, 66% eventually achieved major molecular
response.
In another analysis, the long-term impact of delayed
treatment responses was determined in 258 patients with
CML CP.32 Patients who failed to achieve complete cytogenetic response after 3, 6, and 12 months of imatinib
treatment were increasingly unlikely to achieve complete
cytogenetic response (P ¼ .002) or major molecular
response (P ¼ .004). The probability of an event—loss of
CHR, loss of minor cytogenetic response, increasing
white cell count, transformation to AP/BC, or death from
any cause during imatinib treatment—increased as the
time to complete cytogenetic response increased (P ¼
.16). The authors concluded that although favorable outcomes are possible after delayed responses, patients who
do not achieve early cytogenetic responses may progress
before achieving optimal responses. Therefore, early identification of patients at high risk of not achieving critical
milestones is crucial.32
Clinical trial results also suggest a benefit to achieving early major molecular response in patients receiving
imatinib therapy (Table 3). A recent analysis of 7-year
data by the IRIS investigators demonstrated the long-term
prognostic value of molecular response at specific time
points.33 This analysis used the complete molecular monitoring dataset, consisting of 3627 blood samples from
476 patients in the imatinib arm of the IRIS trial. BCRABL transcript levels at 6, 12, and 18 months predicted
long-term EFS and FFP to AP/BC. EFS was defined as
the time from treatment initiation to loss of CHR, loss of
major cytogenetic response, progression to AP/BC, or
death by any cause. Major molecular response by 12 or 18
months predicted EFS rates of 91% and 95%, respectively, at 7 years. However, achieving major molecular
response at 12 months showed no EFS benefit when compared with not achieving major molecular response but
having complete cytogenetic response; there was minimal
EFS benefit when major molecular response was achieved
at 18 months versus not achieving major molecular
response but having complete cytogenetic response. Con-

versely, EFS was 79% in patients achieving major molecular response by 12 months and 75% in those not
achieving major molecular response at 18 months (vs
achieving major molecular response at 12 months [P ¼
.001] and 18 months [P < .001]). When the definition of
EFS was expanded to include loss of complete cytogenetic
response, EFS rates were 87% for patients with major molecular response at 12 months versus 73% for patients
with no major molecular response (P ¼ .0006), and 92%
for patients with major molecular response at 18 months
versus 65% for patients with no major molecular response
(P < .001). Major molecular response at 12 or 18 months
also was associated with a significantly decreased rate of
transformation to AP/BC. Estimated rates of PFS at 7year follow-up were 99% for patients with major molecular response versus 90% for those without major molecular response at both 12 and 18 months (P < .001 for both
comparisons).33 Furthermore, a reanalysis based on
updated data (excluding 1 patient who died from nonCML causes) found that no patient with major molecular
response at 12 or 18 months progressed to AP or BC over
the 7-year follow-up. Similarly, although follow-up data
in studies of nilotinib and dasatinib in a front-line setting
are immature, 12-month follow-up data indicate that
patients who achieved major molecular response at any
time point did not transform to AP or BC.34
Adherence and Suboptimal Response
Marin and colleagues from the Hammersmith Hospital
have shown that the degree of patient adherence to imatinib is critical in achieving major molecular response.35
These investigators examined adherence patterns during a
3-month period in 87 patients with complete cytogenetic
response who had been receiving imatinib for a median of
approximately 5 years. Highly adherent patients (those
who took >90% of medication as prescribed) had a significantly higher 6-year probability of achieving major
molecular response than did less-adherent patients (94%
vs 14%, respectively; P < .001 [Fig. 1]). Furthermore,
patients who were highly adherent, even if they did not
achieve major molecular response by 12 or 18 months,
had a high probability of eventually achieving major molecular response.35 The authors performed a univariate
analysis of several variables—patient age, sex, weight,
plasma imatinib level, percent adherence, and Sokal risk
group—and found that adherence was the only independent predictor for major molecular response. Clearly, adherence is an important parameter to investigate among
patients with suboptimal response to TKI treatment.

patient education, improved patient-physician communication, and regular physician contact.37
Treating Patients With Suboptimal Response
The optimal treatment course for patients with suboptimal response remains unclear because of a dearth of prospective randomized trials evaluating the correlation
between interventions and clinical outcomes. Options,
however, include increasing the dose of imatinib, changing TKI therapy to nilotinib or dasatinib, or participation
in a clinical trial of an investigational agent.
Figure 1. Six-year probability of major molecular response
(MMR) in 87 patients treated with imatinib is shown according to the measured adherence rate. The probability of MMR
for the 23 patients with an adherence rate 90% was 13.9%,
whereas the probability of MMR for the 64 patients with an
adherence rate >90% was 93.7% (P < .001).35 Reproduced

Assessing Adherence in Patients With
Suboptimal Response
It is important that physicians maintain an index of
suspicion when evaluating whether adherence is a factor
in suboptimal responses in TKI-treated patients. As
recommended in the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network guidelines, adherence should be assessed during
follow-up evaluations in any patient not achieving an
anticipated response within the expected time.17
Although there are few studies of adherence in patients
with CML, several factors have been identified as predictors of poor adherence to TKI therapy; knowledge of these
factors can help physicians recognize at-risk patients.
A retrospective cohort study using a database of participants in employer-based health plans found that
younger age, shorter exposure to imatinib, starting imatinib dose of 400 mg, longer delay between CML diagnosis and imatinib prescription fill, higher concomitant
prescriptions, and higher copayment percentage were
associated with poor adherence to imatinib therapy.36 In
addition, the study by Marin and colleagues at the Hammersmith Hospital found that younger age, adverse events
(AEs [specifically, asthenia, nausea, muscle cramps, and
bone or joint pain]), taking imatinib independently of
meals, and unexplained increases in BCR-ABL1 transcript
levels were associated with poor adherence.35 Several of
these risk factors, particularly AEs, can be modified with
prompt supportive care. Others can be addressed through

1186

Imatinib dose escalation

Interest in optimizing the imatinib dose has arisen
because the maximum tolerated dose was not determined
in patients with CP; only the 400-mg/d dose was studied
in these patients.38 Results of several studies suggest that
although higher imatinib doses as first-line therapy are
associated with early responses, these responses have not
translated into improved EFS, PFS, or OS.9,39,40 In an
early study of imatinib dose escalation, Kantarjian and
colleagues evaluated the efficacy and safety of increasing
imatinib dose to 600 or 800 mg daily in 54 patients with
hematologic resistance or relapse (n ¼ 20) or cytogenetic
resistance or relapse (n ¼ 34) on imatinib 400 mg daily.41
Of the 20 patients receiving escalated doses because of hematologic resistance or relapse, 65% achieved hematologic response, and 5% achieved major cytogenetic
response. Of the 34 patients with cytogenetic resistance or
relapse, 38% achieved major cytogenetic response with
escalated imatinib doses. In a longer-term analysis of
patients having a median follow-up of 61 months from
dose escalation (n ¼ 84), 40% achieved complete cytogenetic response, and 14% achieved partial cytogenetic
response.42 Of patients who received dose escalation
because of cytogenetic failure (n ¼ 63), 52% achieved
complete cytogenetic response, and 16% achieved partial
cytogenetic response; of 21 patients qualifying because of
hematologic failure, 5% achieved complete cytogenetic
response, and 10% achieved partial cytogenetic response.
Results of a retrospective analysis of the IRIS data in
patients who required imatinib dose escalation per protocol or based on European LeukemiaNet recommendations also suggest that dose escalation may benefit patients
with CML CP with suboptimal cytogenetic response.43
The most recent data regarding imatinib dose escalation
were reported in a 2010 Korean study by Koh and colleagues that included 19 patients with suboptimal
response to the standard imatinib dose.44 Consistent with

the results of the IRIS retrospective analysis, escalating the
imatinib dose was found to be a reasonable option for
CML patients with suboptimal response to standard imatinib doses.44 Response in a small number of patients
receiving escalated imatinib doses was found not to
be durable, generally 3 to 6 months.45 Collectively,
these data suggest that higher imatinib doses can overcome lack of optimal response in some patients; however,
higher doses may also be associated with poor
tolerability.46
Treatment with nilotinib in patients resistant
or intolerant to imatinib

The efficacy and safety of nilotinib in patients with
suboptimal response to imatinib are under investigation
in several clinical trials. In the phase 3b, open-label, multicenter ENACT (Expanding Nilotinib Access in Clinical
Trials) study conducted between January 2006 and October 2008, the safety and efficacy of nilotinib 400 mg twice
daily were evaluated in 1422 patients with CML CP who
were resistant and/or intolerant to imatinib in a clinical
practice setting.47-49 Nilotinib was well tolerated overall.
In a subset of patients with suboptimal cytogenetic
response to imatinib (n ¼ 12), 75%, 50%, and 67%
achieved major cytogenetic response, complete cytogenetic response, and CHR, respectively, compared with
45%, 34%, and 43%, respectively, for the overall population (n ¼ 1422).47 The median times to major cytogenetic response and CHR among suboptimal responders
(3.8 and 3.4 months, respectively) were less than in the
overall study population (6.1 and 4.9 months, respectively). On the basis of these data, nilotinib was more
effective in patients with suboptimal response to imatinib
at 6 or 12 months than in patients with imatinib failure.
Preliminary results of an exploratory, United Statesbased, multicenter, open-label study of nilotinib 300 mg
twice daily in patients who achieved complete cytogenetic
response but had suboptimal molecular response to imatinib (BCR-ABL/ABL levels >0.1% on the International
Scale after 12 months; >1-log increase in BCR-ABL/
ABL levels at any time) demonstrated that 6 of 8 evaluable
patients (75%) achieved major molecular response after 3
months of nilotinib treatment.50 All patients maintained
complete cytogenetic response, and 80% of evaluable
patients achieved major molecular response within 9
months. An updated analysis after continued enrollment,
which included 14 patients with a median of 10 months
of nilotinib treatment, showed that 88% of patients
achieved major molecular response at any time.51

Switching to nilotinib after suboptimal response or
intolerance to imatinib in the TIDEL (Therapeutic Intensification in DE-novo Leukemia) II multicenter study in
newly diagnosed patients with CML CP also demonstrated favorable results.52 In this ongoing study, patients
are treated with high-dose imatinib (600 mg/d) and evaluated for imatinib intolerance or suboptimal response (as
defined by BCR-ABL transcript levels of 10% at 3
months, 1% at 6 months, and 0.1% at 12 months by
International Scale). Suboptimal responders receive a
dose escalation of imatinib to 800 mg daily; if the BCRABL transcript target level is not achieved by 3 months after dose escalation or if patients become intolerant to imatinib treatment, patients are switched to nilotinib
(400 mg twice daily). In an interim analysis of 105
patients with a median follow-up of 295 days, 21 patients
switched to nilotinib, and 95% achieved or maintained
complete cytogenetic response. With a median follow-up
of 295 days after switching to nilotinib, 9 of the 12
patients who were intolerant to imatinib achieved major
molecular response; 1 of the 7 patients with suboptimal
response to imatinib achieved major molecular
response.52
An ongoing open-label, randomized, phase 3 study
(NCT00802841) in patients responding suboptimally to
imatinib 400 mg daily is comparing imatinib dose escalation (600 mg daily) with switching to nilotinib 400 mg
twice daily. Eligibility requirements include 3 to 18
months of imatinib treatment and suboptimal response to
imatinib (defined as no cytogenetic response at 3 to <6
months of treatment, no partial cytogenetic response at
6 to <12 months of treatment, and no complete cytogenetic response at 12 to <18 months of treatment).
Additional prospective trials of nilotinib are underway. A phase 3 study comparing nilotinib 400 mg twice
daily with imatinib 600 mg daily in patients with suboptimal response to imatinib 400 mg daily (LASOR) is
ongoing, with primary outcome data expected in early

nilotinib therapy in patients with suboptimal response to
imatinib at 18 months.54
Treatment with dasatinib in patients resistant or
intolerant to imatinib

Treatment with dasatinib was studied in an openlabel, randomized, phase 3, dose-optimization trial conducted in patients with CML CP who were imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant. Patients were randomly
assigned to 1 of 4 dasatinib treatment groups: 100 mg
once daily (n ¼ 167), 50 mg twice daily (n ¼ 168), 140
mg once daily (n ¼ 167), or 70 mg twice daily (n ¼
168).55 Although the results were not stratified according
to suboptimal response at study initiation, 43% of
patients entered the study with CHR, and 17% of patients
entered with major cytogenetic response. Results at 48
months of follow-up were recently reported.56 Response
rates were similar across all 4 treatment arms, and PFS was
similar in patients with or without baseline BCR-ABL
mutations. The authors concluded that dasatinib 100 mg
once daily has an acceptable benefit-risk profile in patients
failing or responding suboptimally to imatinib.
In addition, a phase 2-3 open-label study of dasatinib versus imatinib 800 mg daily in patients with a suboptimal response to imatinib was recently completed, and a
prospective, open-label, randomized study evaluating the
efficacy of dasatinib and imatinib 600 mg daily is ongoing
in Japan. These prospective studies will better define the
efficacy and safety of different treatment options, including escalated imatinib doses and treatment with nilotinib
and dasatinib, in patients with a suboptimal response to
imatinib.
With the recent regulatory approvals and availability
of positive, longer-term data for front-line nilotinib and
dasatinib therapy in CML patients,57,58 more clinicians
will likely prescribe these drugs for newly diagnosed
patients. There are no clinical data yet describing suboptimal response to first-line therapy with nilotinib or dasatinib. As experience with these agents in newly diagnosed
patients accumulates, the definitions of suboptimal
response and failure may need to be revisited. Some clinicians may be concerned that patients with suboptimal
responses to nilotinib or dasatinib may have poorer outcomes than patients with similar responses to imatinib;
the prognosis of these patients will become clear with
greater clinical experience. Furthermore, the best way to
manage these patients is not clear. The outcomes after
switching from first-line nilotinib to dasatinib (and vice
versa) or changing to imatinib, or a clinical trial of an ex-

1188

perimental agent (eg, bosutinib or ponatinib) remain to
be studied. Although data on response to second-line nilotinib after first-line dasatinib failure or dasatinib response
after first-line nilotinib failure have not yet been reported,
nilotinib has shown favorable third-line response in a single phase 2 study in patients who failed imatinib and dasatinib.59 Similarly, third-line response to dasatinib has
been demonstrated in a small study of patients who failed
both imatinib and nilotinib.60
Treatment with an investigational agent

Patients not achieving optimal response to currently
available treatments can be considered for a clinical trial
of an investigational agent.17 Several targeted therapies
are in clinical development. Preliminary results from an
ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study of the multikinase,
pan–BCR-ABL inhibitor ponatinib (AP24534) showed
antileukemic activity in patients with refractory CML,
including patients with the T315I mutation.61 Phase 1
and 2 trials of ponatinib are ongoing in patients with refractory CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Danusertib (PHA-739358) is a multikinase aurora inhibitor
with in vitro activity against wild-type ABL and ABL/
T315I62; preliminary results from an ongoing phase 1
dose-escalation study indicate antileukemic activity in
patients with AP or BC who failed imatinib and/or nilotinib or dasatinib.
Bosutinib (SKI-606), a dual Src/ABL inhibitor, is
the furthest along in clinical development for CML. Preliminary results from a phase 1-2 study in patients in CP
with resistance or intolerance to imatinib demonstrated
bosutinib efficacy in patients failing to achieve optimal
response to imatinib.63 Bosutinib had a favorable toxicity
profile in both phases of the study. Bosutinib has also
been studied in the third-line setting. An open-label phase
1-2 study of patients who failed imatinib therapy and
were resistant or intolerant to dasatinib, or resistant to
nilotinib, demonstrated that 13% of patients achieved
complete cytogenetic response and 26% achieved major
cytogenetic response at 6 months of bosutinib therapy.
Bosutinib was well tolerated in these patients, although
27% of dasatinib-intolerant, 14% of dasatinib-resistant,
and 11% of nilotinib-resistant patients discontinued
treatment because of AEs.64

producing a constitutively active tyrosine kinase4 led to
the rational development of TKIs. In the landmark IRIS
trial, imatinib demonstrated significantly improved longterm outcomes compared with an IFN-alpha/cytarabine
combination regimen.10 With the more potent TKIs,
nilotinib and dasatinib, the need to quantify responses
beyond cytogenetic responses became apparent. Therefore, alongside the development of more effective therapies, more sensitive monitoring techniques are becoming
a standard of care in the management of CML.
The European LeukemiaNet and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines are evolving as experience with TKIs grows and clinical data mature. As the
predictive value of cytogenetic and molecular responses at
given time points becomes clearer, physicians are better
able to identify patients at risk of failure or suboptimal
response. Patients who fail first-line therapy have
unequivocally poorer outcomes compared with optimal
responders.25,26 Patients with early suboptimal responses
tend to have poor long-term outcomes, and a change in
treatment should be considered for these patients. The
best treatment approach for these patients is still an active
area of research.
There are 3 key issues to consider in patients with
suboptimal response: 1) identification of suboptimal
response, which requires familiarity with the milestone
responses typically achieved during imatinib treatment at
specific intervals; 2) monitoring frequency, particularly
for cytogenetic analysis and molecular monitoring of
BCR-ABL transcript levels (it is noteworthy that according
to 1 survey, not all physicians perform cytogenetic analysis
or polymerase chain reaction testing according to guideline recommendations66); and 3) treatment of suboptimal
response, which requires regular clinical assessment.
Physicians may be hesitant to switch to a second-line therapy when the first-line treatment continues to provide
benefit.9
Despite incremental short-term and medium-term
gains associated with continued imatinib therapy—even
at higher doses—in patients with suboptimal responses,
the long-term prognosis with this strategy remains poor.
Preliminary data suggest that switching to second-line
therapies may be effective for patients with suboptimal
response, but this needs confirmation.46,67-72 Comparison of the relative efficacy of imatinib dose escalation and
next-generation TKIs awaits results from prospective
randomized studies. This is an exciting era in CML management. With more effective treatments, increasingly
sensitive monitoring techniques, and the ability to iden-

tify patients at risk of suboptimal response and poor longterm outcomes, physicians move closer to individualized
care of patients for longer patient survival.
