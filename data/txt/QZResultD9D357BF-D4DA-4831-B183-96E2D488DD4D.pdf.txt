Abstract

Author Manuscript

Rates of the most common gynecologic cancer, endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC), continue to
rise, mirroring the global epidemic of obesity, a well-known EAC risk factor. Thus, identifying
novel molecular targets to prevent and/or mitigate EAC is imperative. The prevalent Type 1 EAC
commonly harbors loss of the tumor suppressor, Pten, leading to AKT activation. The major
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, GRP78, is a potent pro-survival protein to maintain ER
homeostasis, and as a cell surface protein, is known to regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway. To
determine whether targeting GRP78 could suppress EAC development, we created a conditional
knockout mouse model utilizing progesterone receptor (PR)-Cre-recombinase to achieve Pten and
Grp78 (cPtenf/fGrp78f/f) deletion in the endometrial epithelium. Mice with a single Pten (cPtenf/f)
deletion developed well-differentiated EAC by 4 weeks. In contrast, no cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice
developed EAC, even after more than 8 months of observation. Histologic examination of uteri
from cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice also revealed no complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH), a wellestablished EAC precursor. These histologic observations among the cPtenf/fGrp78f/f murine uteri
also corresponded to abrogation of AKT activation within the endometrium. We further observed
that GRP78 co-localized with activated AKT on the surface of EAC thus providing an opportunity

for therapeutic targeting. Consistent with previous findings that cell surface GRP78 is an upstream
regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling, we show here that in vivo short-term systemic treatment with a
highly specific monoclonal antibody against GRP78 suppressed AKT activation and increased
apoptosis in the cPtenf/f tumors. Collectively, these findings present GRP78-targeting therapy as
an efficacious therapeutic option for EAC.

INTRODUCTION
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the most prevalent gynecologic cancer in the
United States (US) and accounts for nearly 50,000 incident cases annually.1 Contemporary
molecular characterization of EAC has unearthed additional deleterious mutations and
mechanisms responsible for tumor development.2 One of the most common mutations
detected in the more prevalent Type 1 EAC is the loss of the tumor suppressor gene, Pten
(phosphatase and tensin homolog) and its phosphatase protein product.3,4 Pten mutations
resulting in PTEN loss are involved in a wide variety of human cancers, including >60% of
endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the endometrium.3,4 The deleterious phenotype resulting
from Pten-loss has also been observed in in vitro and in vivo tumor models.5–9 While
constitutive deletion of Pten results in embryonic loss, conditional deletion of Pten in target
cells has permitted exploration of spontaneous tumorigenesis in various tissues.10–12 For
EAC a conditional Pten deletion within the endometrial epithelium leads to development of
endometrial hyperplasia and Type I EAC in female mice.5 Furthermore, the knockout of
Pten by the progesterone receptor (PR)-driven Cre-recombinase progresses along the
histologic continuum of complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) to EAC, thereby
facilitating specific interrogation of Pten-driven EAC development, and exploring strategies
to therapeutically block EAC development.5

The glucose regulated protein-78 (GRP78) is a key member of the heat shock protein-70
(HSP70) family and an important endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein.13,14 The
ER is an essential organelle required for the synthesis and maturation of membraneassociated and secretory proteins. Pathophysiologic conditions that disrupt the ER result in
ER stress, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and marked upregulation of
GRP78.15 ER stress has been reported to be transmissible to the tumor microenvironment16
and is activated in EAC.17 The role of GRP78 in human cancers appears to be multifaceted,
and its overexpression has been cited in a wide variety of human cancers, including breast
and gynecologic cancers.18–20
EAC development has been linked to obesity,20 and increased secretory activities associated
with obesity lead to ER stress, UPR activation, and GRP78 upregulation.21 Within the
uterus, GRP78 overexpression is more frequently apparent in EAC than in normal
endometrium.17,19,22 Although benign endometrial epithelial cells will have some basal
expression of GRP78, women with EAC whose carcinoma cells exhibit even higher levels

of GRP78 expression tend to fare worse, clinically.22 Furthermore, GRP78 expression levels
in visceral adipocytes adjacent to the uterine corpus are also higher in women with EAC
who have more worrisome clinical features (e.g., myometrial invasion, advanced stage).22
While GRP78 is known to be an upstream regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, GRP78 has
also been shown to be a downstream target of AKT, an important signal transduction
pathway in EAC.19 Additionally, GRP78 is important for the optimal activation of AKT in
response to cisplatin in EAC cell lines.19 Despite these observations, the key question of
whether GRP78 is required for EAC development or progression is still not known.

Author Manuscript

Traditionally, GRP78 is regarded as an ER luminal protein critical for protein folding and
processing, degrading malfolded ER proteins, and maintaining the transmembrane ER stress
sensors and pro-apoptotic components in their inactive forms.15,23–25 Recent discovery of
GRP78 localized on the plasma membrane of cancer cells, has led to the further
characterization that ER stress, as seen in cancer cells due to both intrinsic and extrinsic
factors, can actively promote the surface expression of GRP78.26,27 At the cell surface,
GRP78 forms complexes with PI3K and enhances PI(3,4,5)P3 production, consistent with
its novel role as a regulator of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which promotes cell
proliferation, survival, metastasis, and chemoresistance.28 Furthermore, the preferential
presence of GRP78 on the surface of cancer but not normal cells in vivo provides a potential
opportunity for highly specific therapeutic intervention.26,29–32 Recently, a high-affinity,
highly specific monoclonal antibody (MAb159) against GRP78 has been identified and has
shown therapeutic efficacy in reducing tumor growth in vivo.32 In this study, we used a
combined approach of genetic knockout and antibody targeting of GRP78 to provide direct
evidence that GRP78 is critical and necessary for the development of Pten-driven EAC, and
may represent a new therapeutic opportunity for EAC.

RESULTS
Creation of biallelic deletion of Grp78 and Pten in the mouse uterus
Across successive breeding generations, PCR analysis of female pups at 10 days confirmed
the generation of the distinct genotypes used throughout these studies: cPtenf/fGrp78+/+,
cPtenf/fGrp78f/+, and cPtenf/fGrp78f/f with mice lacking Cre expression serving as wild-type
(WT) mice. Mouse tail genomic DNA was used for genotyping and the status of Pten and
Grp78 alleles in the uterus was confirmed by PCR of uterine DNA analyzed at 8 weeks
(Figure 1a).

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemical staining of uterine cross-sections first showed progesterone receptor
(PR) primarily localized in the endometrium (Figure 1b). Loss of expression of the targeted
genes within the endometrium was then confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis
(Figure 1b). GRP78 and PTEN protein expression was detected in the uteri of WT mice,
while expression of both proteins was substantially reduced in the endometria from
cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice (Figure 1b).
To assess the level and durability of PTEN and GRP78 loss, Western blot analysis of tissue
lysate from the uteri at 4- and 20-weeks was performed. Reduction or loss of PTEN
expression was confirmed at each time point. Similarly, GRP78 expression in the uterus

declined significantly in mice homozygous for the Grp78 floxed alleles compared to the
uteri from WT mice (Figure 1c). Interestingly, we noted that for the cPtenf/fGrp78f/+ mice,
the expression level of GRP78 was only modestly reduced at 4 weeks and by 20 weeks, its
level was similar to that of WT, thereby suggesting a compensatory response in the
heterozygous mice to restore normal levels of GRP78 (Figure 1c). Immunohistochemical
evaluation of GRP78 expression in FFPE uterine sections further confirmed durable and
near absent GRP78 expression within the endometrial epithelial cells of cPtenf/fGrp78f/f
uteri at both 4- and 8-weeks (Figure 1d).
Conditional Grp78 deletion from the endometrium blocks endometrial cancer development

Author Manuscript

To determine if anatomic differences existed in the murine uteri from different genotypes,
biometric data were taken from euthanized mice (Table 1). The mean uterine weights
between cPtenf/fGrp78f/f and WT mice were not statistically different at 10 days and 4
weeks (Table 1). However, by 4 weeks, the mean uterine weights of cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ mice
were significantly greater than that of both WT and cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice. cPtenf/fGrp78+/+
mice at 8 weeks showed the greatest mean uterine weight compared to cPtenf/fGrp78f/+ and
cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice (Figure 2). There was no statistically significant difference in mean
uterine weights between cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ and cPtenf/fGrp78f/+ mice at both 4- and 8-weeks
(Table 1).

Author Manuscript

To account for any variability in constitutive differences in mouse size, uterine weights were
individually normalized against the total body weights (TBW). There was no statistically
significant difference in mean TBW or normalized uterine weights across the
cPtenf/fGrp78+/+, cPtenf/fGrp78f/+, cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice at 10 days regardless of their
Grp78 status (p-values >0.7, Figure 2). However, at 4- and 8-weeks, both cPtenf/fGrp78+/+
and cPtenf/fGrp78f/+ mice had significantly greater normalized uterine weights compared to
WT and cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice (both p<0.01, Figure 2). While the normalized uterine weights
for 4 week-old WT and cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice were similar, interestingly, normalized uterine
weights from cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice at 8 weeks were also significantly smaller than that from
WT mice (p =0.01, Figure 2).
Endometrioid adenocarcinoma is histologically undetectable after conditional Grp78
deletion from the endometrium

Author Manuscript

To determine whether GRP78 blocked or delayed EAC development, the uteri from all mice
were anatomically and histologically evaluated from 10 days onwards by a gynecologic
pathologist (PMF). Anatomic inspection of uteri at 4- and 8-weeks showed no morphologic
differences between cPtenf/fGrp78f/f and WT mice (Figure 3a). Histologically, uteri from
cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ mice as early as 10 days showed complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH), and
well-differentiated (i.e., Grade 1) EAC was observed as early as 11 days (Figure 3b). EAC
was seen in 82% of cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ mice, and 92% of cPtenf/fGrp78f/+ mice by 4 weeks
(Figure 3c). At 8 weeks, 80% of cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ mice and 94% of cPtenf/fGrp78f/+ mice
demonstrated EAC. Remarkably, however, at 4- and 8-weeks, no EAC was observed in the
cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice (all p-values <0.001). (Figure 3c).

To characterize whether EAC development was halted or delayed, we performed necropsies
of the cPtenf/fGrp78f/f mice at 4- and 5-months. At both time points, no cases of EAC were
identified (Figure 4). In contrast, 80% and 100% of cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ and cPtenf/fGrp78f/+
mice, respectively, developed EAC at 4 months. Mice with both Pten and Grp78 inactivated
(cPtenf/fGrp78f/f) failed to develop any EAC even after 8 months, findings similar to that
seen in WT mice (log-rank p=1.0, Figure 4). Collectively, our data demonstrated that
homozygous Grp78 deletion completely blocked development of both Pten-mediated EAC
and its precursor, CAH, while heterozygous Grp78 deletion could significantly delay EAC
development (log-rank p=0.03, Figure 4) but was insufficient to prevent tumor development
altogether (log-rank p<0.0001, Figure 4).
GRP78 deficiency inhibits AKT activation in Pten-null endometrium

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

AKT activation is an important mechanism in the development and progression of many
solid tumors, including this Pten-null EAC model. Recent in vitro evidence shows that
GRP78 is needed for optimal AKT activation in EAC19; therefore, we sought to determine
whether genetic deletion of Grp78 from the endometrial epithelia could block AKT
activation in cPtenf/fGrp78f/f uteri. As demonstrated by immunofluorescent staining
followed by confocal microscopy, endometrial tumors harvested from necropsy showed
robust expression of AKT and GRP78 in cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ endometrial epithelial cells
(Figure 5a). Although AKT was activated in the cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ uteri as evidenced by
serine 473 phosphorylation, this activation was markedly suppressed in the cPtenf/fGrp78f/f
uteri, correlating with the lack of GRP78 expression (Figure 5a). This result was confirmed
in Western blots using lysates from WT, cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ and cPtenf/fGrp78f/f uteri (Figure
5b). We further determined that S6 phosphorylation (serine 235/236), which is downstream
of AKT activation was also suppressed in cPtenf/fGrp78f/f uteri (Figure 5c). Dual
immunofluorescent staining of pAKT and GRP78 in 4 week cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ uteri further
demonstrated that GRP78 colocalized with pAKT at the cell surface (Figure 5d).
UPR activation is often associated with tumorigenesis.15 In the Pten-null EAC model, eIF2α
phosphorylation downstream of PERK signaling was observed in the cancerous
cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ uteri but not in the WT (Figure 6). Phosphorylation of eIF2α was also
detected in the cPtenf/fGrp78f/f uteri, consistent with previous reports of eIF2α activation in
GRP78 knockdown in other cell types (Figure 6).33 In contrast, the expression of CHOP, a
pro-apoptotic UPR marker downstream of PERK signaling, was detected in only a few cells
in the cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ uteri and not detected in the WT or the cPtenf/fGrp78f/f uteri (Figure
6).

Therapeutic targeting of cell surface GRP78 induces endometrial cancer regression
The detection of GRP78 at the surface of EAC cells presents a key opportunity for
therapeutic targeting.34 To test this, 3-week-old cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ mice were randomized to
receive either IgG-vehicle or the highly specific anti-GRP78 antibody, MAb159 via
biweekly intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections for 4 weeks. Uteri were collected at necropsy and
examined with a gynecologic pathologist (PMF) blinded to the treatment group. Uteri in
both treatment groups were morphologically abnormal with indurated uterine horns;
however, MAb159-treated uteri were generally smaller (about 40%) than IgG-treated uteri

(Figure 7a). After 4 weeks of treatment, uterine cross-sections from the IgG group showed
well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma defined as and as evidenced by back-toback endometrial glands exhibiting hyperchromatic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli (Figure
7b). There are also focal areas with superficial myometrial invasion. Uteri from the
MAb159-treated group also showed similar morphology as those in the IgG-treated group,
but MAb159-treated uteri also showed larger areas of necrosis than their IgG counterparts
(Figure 7b). To determine whether or not GRP78-targeting therapy is capable of suppressing
AKT and S6 activation, we analyzed the uteri from cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ mice for pAKT and
pS6. Both AKT and S6 activation were observed in established cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ EAC
tumors at 7 weeks (Figure 7c). Therapeutic delivery of MAb159 against cell surface GRP78
mitigates AKT and S6 activation and results in decreased expression of pro-tumorigenic
pAKT and pS6. Furthermore, TUNEL staining revealed an increase in apoptotic cells after
MAb159-treatment compared to IgG-vehicle treated cells (Figure 7c), which, taken together,
provides additional support for GRP78 as a therapeutic target for EAC treatment by
suppressing AKT activation and increasing apoptosis.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

We use a conditional knockout mouse model of EAC to demonstrate that the specific
ablation of GRP78 from the endometrium inhibits AKT activation while durably preventing
PTEN-mediated EAC development even beyond 300 days of life. Another key finding of
particular importance in our work was the prevention of the EAC precursor, complex
atypical hyperplasia, after tissue-specific GRP78 knockout. Furthermore, we also show that
homozygous Grp78 deletion in the endometrial epithelial cells not only prevents EAC
development, it also interrupts and attenuates AKT activation mediated by PTEN loss.
Interestingly, re-expression of GRP78 to the WT level was observed in mice still harboring a
single functional Grp78 allele, suggesting some compensatory response to restore normal
GRP78 levels. While the EAC tumor formation was delayed in these mice, they eventually
developed EAC, similar to the cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ mice. Importantly, with GRP78 detectable
on the surface of the EAC cells, we show that GRP78 is therapeutically targetable with a
monoclonal antibody, and that GRP78-targeted therapy results in reduction of AKT
activation and increased areas of tumoral apoptosis.

Author Manuscript

The critical role of GRP78 in the development of several human cancers and the
manifestation of chemo- or hormone-resistant phenotypes is well-documented.18,35,36
Higher GRP78 expression levels in tumors have been correlated with more aggressive tumor
characteristics (e.g., invasion, lymph node involvement) and worse clinical outcome (e.g.,
survival).14 The level of GRP78 expression in clinical samples of invasive breast carcinoma
has been shown to predict responsiveness to certain cytotoxic chemotherapies, such as
anthracyclines and alkylating agents.18,37 Meanwhile, in cell lines, high GRP78 levels
appear to be associated with aggressive phenotypes, including increased growth,
invasiveness, decreased apoptosis and increased survival.34,38 GRP78 also plays an integral
role in several critical cell signaling pathways, many of which (e.g., PI3K/AKT), figure
prominently in human cancers.39

In vitro and in vivo cancer models support the relationship between GRP78 and AKT
activation.14,27,32,40,41 For example, in PTEN loss driven prostate cancer and leukemia, a
partial reduction of GRP78 suppresses AKT activation.6,7 But, how GRP78 affects AKT
activation could be multifactorial. Although GRP78 is generally regarded as an ER resident
protein, a subfraction of GRP78 localizes at the cell surface in selected cell types, notably
cancer cells.27,41 Cell surface GRP78, through its interaction with different ligands and cell
surface proteins, can mediate important signal transduction pathways including PI3K/AKT
and this could play a major role since MAb159 targeting cell surface GRP78 is highly
effective in suppressing AKT activation in a variety of tumors, including EAC. However, it
is also possible that, as a major molecular chaperone in the ER, GRP78 may be required for
processing important growth factors and the cell surface expression of their corresponding
receptors, which might regulate AKT activation.

Author Manuscript

One proposed mechanism in which cell surface GRP78 activates AKT is by complexing
with PI3K to promote PIP3 formation.28 Consistent with this notion, colocalization of
GRP78 with pAKT on the cell surface in Pten-null EAC was detected, similar to the
phenomena seen in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.42 Collectively, we report here for the first
time that, in this murine Pten-null EAC, endometrium-specific GRP78 deletion is able to
suppress AKT and S6 activation. Our targeted genetic deletion of GRP78 using floxed
murine models provides compelling evidence to explore and identify pharmacologic means
to block GRP78 and further represents a therapeutic opportunity to exploit this target.14,30

Author Manuscript

In endometrial cancer, perturbation of cell surface GRP78 with a polyclonal antibody
directed against its C-terminus induced apoptosis in AN3CA cells in vitro in association
with reduced AKT phosphorylation.34 We have recently identified a highly specific
monoclonal antibody against GRP78 that is capable of inhibiting PI3K/AKT activation and
suppressing tumorigenesis, thus, representing a new anti-cancer therapeutic strategy.32 In
the current study, monoclonal antibody targeting of GRP78 in vivo not only resulted in
decreased tumor with increased tumoral apoptosis, but also in the suppression of AKT
activation, further supporting the interplay between GRP78 and AKT during EAC
development and growth. Given the pleiotropic role of GRP78 in tumorigenesis and
progression, additional mechanisms for this anti-tumor phenotype towards interruption of
endometrial epithelial cell growth and maturation, merits further exploration.

Author Manuscript

In the decades since identifying the link between EAC, obesity and hyperestrogenism,
significant progress has been made to better understand the molecular and genetic
underpinnings of endometrial carcinoma.43 The whole genome characterization of
endometrial carcinomas by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) further implicates PTEN
mutations and co-existing AKT pathway alterations as common genomic events early in the
development of EAC.2 Endometrioid adenocarcinomas are clearly the more prevalent form
of EAC, accounting for >65% of all EACs. This type of EAC also has a recognizable
precancerous state, complex atypical hyperplasia, which is blocked experimentally by
tissue-specific GRP78 deletion. Given the pervasiveness of EAC due to the obesity
epidemic, preventive and therapeutic strategies to block obesity-related CAH and EAC carry
significant potential to deliver a tremendous public health impact.

The parental male mouse PRCre/+ Ptenf/f, on a C57BL6/129SV genetic background5 was
mated with parental female mouse Ptenf/fGrp78f/f on a C57/BL6xDBA2/129 genetic
background.6 These mice were then crossed over successive generations to yield, first,
PRCre/+Ptenf/fGrp78f/+ mice, then PRCre/+Ptenf/fGrp78f/f (cPtenf/fGrp78f/f) mice
(Supplementary Figure 1). Mice without the PRCre/+ allele served as the phenotypic wildtype controls. All animal experiments were conducted in concordance with the U.S. Public
Health Service Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals after protocol
approval from the USC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Genotyping of tail or uteri genomic DNA were performed using PCR primers
(Supplementary Table 1) as previously described.5,6 At various time points, all uteri were
harvested, weighed, and measured at the time of necropsy, just prior to snap freezing for
tissue lysate or fixation in 10% buffered formalin for microscopic examination. Tissue
morphology was examined after hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining of 5 μm thick formalinfixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections. All histologic diagnoses were rendered by a
gynecologic pathologist with expertise in gynecologic cancers (PMF).

In vivo monoclonal antibody treatment
Three-week-old cPtenf/fGrp78+/+ mice were randomized into two treatment groups: IgGvehicle and MAb159, a highly specific anti-GRP78 antibody. The mice were treated with
either IgG-vehicle or MAb159 (10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection twice weekly for 4
weeks after which time mice were euthanized. Uteri were collected at necropsy for analysis.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Data regarding mouse and uterine weights are expressed as mean ± SD. The Mann-Whitney
rank-sum test was used to analyze nonparametric and non-normally distributed data. Logrank analyses were used to compare survival curves. A 2-tailed p-value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using GraphPad (Prism
Version 5, La Jolla, CA).
