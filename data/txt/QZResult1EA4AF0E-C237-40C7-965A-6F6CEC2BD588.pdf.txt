ABSTRACT
We tested the efficacy of lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which
interrupts the HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways, in
a panel of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, and examined the drug
mechanism. Lapatinib showed an anti-proliferative effect in HCC 1937, MDA-MB-468,
and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Lapatinib induced significant apoptosis and inhibited
CIP2A and p-Akt in a dose and time-dependent manner in the three TNBC cell lines.
Overexpression of CIP2A reduced lapatinib-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells.
In addition, lapatinib increased PP2A activity (in relation to CIP2A inhibition).
Moreover, lapatinib-induced apoptosis and p-Akt downregulation was attenuated
by PP2A antagonist okadaic acid. Furthermore, lapatinib indirectly decreased CIP2A
transcription by disturbing the binding of Elk1 to the CIP2A promoter. Importantly,
lapatinib showed anti-tumor activity in mice bearing MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors,
and suppressed CIP2A as well as p-Akt in these xenografted tumors. In summary,
inhibition of CIP2A determines the effects of lapatinib-induced apoptosis in TNBC
cells. In addition to being a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2 and EGFR, lapatinib
also inhibits CIP2A/PP2A/p-Akt signaling in TNBC cells.

INTRODUCTION

subtype breast cancer with aggressive behavior, advanced
disease status and poor prognosis. Because of the lack of

targeting agents and limited therapeutic options, treatment
of TNBC remains a great clinical challenge.
Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A
(CIP2A) was originally identified as a cellular protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, and has been shown
to control oncogenic cellular signals by suppressing the
tumor suppressor PP2A [1, 2]. CIP2A overexpression
has been found in several human malignancies including
breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer,
head and neck cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer and
non-small cell lung cancer [1-9]. In addition, CIP2A
promotes the malignant growth of breast cancer cells
and correlates with poor prognosis [3, 10]. Recently
a comprehensive review by De et al. proposed an
interconnected regulatory network (oncogenic nexus) of
CIP2A [1]. This nexus is established through either direct
interactions of CIP2A or indirectly through interactions
of the CIP2A-PP2A with either multiple key cellular
proteins/transcription factors or with components of key
oncogenic pathways [1]. For example, through suppressing
the serine/threonine phosphatase function of PP2A, CIP2A
can activate oncogenic proteins such as c-Myc, ERK, and
Akt [1, 11, 12]. Moreover, as an oncogenic protein in the
transformation of cells and cancer progression, CIP2A
has been shown to correlate with a number of drug effects
in cancer [1]. In our previous studies, we demonstrated
that pharmacological decrease of CIP2A, thereby
increased PP2A activity and subsequent inactivation of
the p-Akt signaling, inhibited proliferation and induced
apoptosis in breast cancer cells [13, 14]. Furthermore,
recent reviews have extensively outlined approaches to
circumvent multiple challenges for CIP2A-based drugs to
be established as a conventional and effective anticancer
therapy in the clinics [1, 15, 16]. The comprehensive
review by Khanna et al [15] summarized that CIP2A
overexpression is found in almost all solid cancers and
in some hematological malignancies such as acute and
chronic myeloid leukemia, and that high expression of
CIP2A has been proposed as a useful biomarker that
predicts therapeutic response to chemotherapeutics such as
doxorubicin, cisplatin, bortezomib, erlotinib, Checkpoint
Kinase 1 inhibitors and pro-senescence based therapies
such as vinka alkaloids chemotherapy and several in
development small molecules [15, 17, 18]. Together,
these data suggest that CIP2A plays an important role in
breast cancer cells and that targeting CIP2A could be a
new therapeutic option.
Lapatinib, an orally active small molecule that
inhibits the tyrosine kinases of HER2 and epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), is approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore,
inhibition of p-ERK, p-Akt, cyclin D1 and transforming
growth factor alpha, are also related in lapatinib-induced
HER2-positive breast cancer cell apoptosis [19-24].
Several studies have demonstrated that lapatinib in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

neoadjuvant setting achieved higher pathological complete
response [25-28]. A phase III study revealed that the
combination of lapatinib and capcitabine is effective in
previously treated metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer
[29]. Interestingly, lapatinib had an antiproliferative effect
in HER2-negative breast cancer or TNBC cells [30-33].
These findings suggest that lapatinib might have certain
HER2 independent anticancer properties. However,
little has been explored regarding the drug effects and
mechanisms of lapatinib in HER2-negative breast
cancer cells. In this present study, we tested the efficacy
of lapatinib in a panel of TNBC cells and examined the
drug activity. We further reported the apoptotic effect and
mechanism of lapatinib in TNBC cells. We found that
CIP2A correlated with the effect of lapatinib in TNBC
cells.

RESULTS
Lapatinib induced apoptosis in triple negative
breast cancer cells
To investigate the apoptosis effect induced by
lapatinib, we tested three TNBC cell lines: MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-468, and HCC-1937. The triple negative
characteristics of all cell lines were substantiated by
western blotting. MCF-7 was used as a positive control
for ER expression and SK-BR3, an HER2 positive
breast cancer cell line, was a positive control for HER2
expression (Figure 1A). Since lapatinib is a dual EGFR/
HER2 kinase inhibitor, we first examined the target effects
(on HER2 and EGFR signals) of lapatinib in HER2positive SK-BR3 cells. As shown in Figure 1B, MTT
test confirmed the antiproliferative effect of lapatinib
on SK-BR-3. Lapatinib, and trastuzumab, an anti-HER2
monoclonal antibody, both revealed inhibition of p-HER2
in SK-BR3. Similarly, lapatinib and cetuximab, an antiEGFR monoclonal antibody, both downregulated p-EGFR
and p-ERK in SK-BR3. Interestingly, only lapatinib
demonstrated CIP2A inhibition, and both anti-EGFR
or anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies had no effects on
CIP2A (Figure 1B, right). Furthermore, lapatinib elicited
apoptosis in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and HCC1937 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C). Flow
cytometric detection of sub-G1 cells at the indicated
times (24, 48 and 72 h) and doses (2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10
μM) also demonstrated that lapatinib induced apoptosis
(Figure 1D). To summarize, lapatinib-induced apoptosis
in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and HCC-1937 cells
is both dose- and time-dependent. These results indicated
that TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and
HCC-1937, as well as HER2 positive cell line SK-BR-3,
are sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of lapatinib.

MB-468, and HCC-1937 cells after treatment for 48 hours.
Lower CIP2A and p-Akt levels were also noted when cells
were treated with lapatinib (10 μM) for other treatment
periods (24, 36, 48 h) (Figure 2B).

In our previous study, we found that bortezomib
induced apoptosis in TNBC cells through downregulation
of CIP2A and p-Akt, suggesting that CIP2A is a target of
bortezomib [13]. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized
that CIP2A may also play a role in the molecular events
associated with apoptosis induced by lapatinib in TNBC
cells. As demonstrated in Figure 2A, the protein level of
CIP2A and p-Akt decreased significantly in proportion
to the lapatinib concentration in MDA-MB-231, MDA-

Validation of the CIP2A/p-Akt pathway as a

reduced significantly in CIP2A overexpressing MDAMB-468 cells (Figure 3A). Because CIP2A is a cellular
inhibitor of PP2A [2, 34], we tested the PP2A activity in
lapatinib-treated cells. As shown in Figure 3B, lapatinib
significantly increased the phosphatase activity of PP2A
in lapatinib-sensitive cell lines. In addition, okadaic acid,
a PP2A inhibitor acting as a negative control, decreased
the phosphatase activity of PP2A in these three cell lines;
while forskolin, a PP2A agonist acting as a positive
control, increased PP2A activity in the cells (Figure 3B).
Moreover, pretreatment with okadaic acid eliminated the
effects of lapatinib on apoptosis in lapatinib-sensitive
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453
cells (Figure 3C). Next we performed siRNA of PP2Ac
(Catalytic subunit of PP2A enzyme complex) and examine
the role of PP2A in lapatinib-induced effects. As shown
in Figure 3D, since CIP2A is an endogenous inhibitor
of PP2A, knockdown PP2Ac did not significantly alter
CIP2A protein expression or lapatinib-induced CIP2A
inhibition (row 1, Figure 3D western blot). However,
knockdown PP2Ac by siRNA reduced lapatinib-induced
apoptosis (Figure 3D, upper panel), in association with
increased PP2A phosphatase-related p-Akt expression

(row 3, Figure 3D western blot). The result suggested
knockdown of PP2Ac partially reversed the effects of
lapatinib on p-Akt and apoptosis, supporting the role of
PP2A in lapatinib-induced apoptosis and p-Akt inhibition.
Together, these results suggest that lapatinib mediates
apoptosis in TNBC cells through the CIP2A/PP2A/p-Akt
pathway.

Lapatinib inhibits transcription of CIP2A in
TNBC cells
To further study how lapatinib inhibited CIP2A
expression, we first tested whether lapatinib could increase
CIP2A elimination (degradation) when translation was
blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
(CHX). Our data showed that after protein translation was
blocked by CHX, the rate of CIP2A degradation did not
change significantly with or without lapatinib treatment in
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 4A). This
suggested that the effect of lapatinib on CIP2A may occur
at the pre-translation level. We next investigated whether
lapatinib suppressed CIP2A transcription via real-time

quantitative PCR analysis. As shown in Figure 4B, CIP2A
mRNA levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner upon
treatment with lapatinib in sensitive MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468, HCC-1937 cells (Figure 4B). Therefore,
we hypothesized that lapatinib inhibited CIP2A at the
transcription level.
To further illustrate the possible mechanism through
which lapatinib reduced CIP2A mRNA, we assumed
that lapatinib may inhibit CIP2A promoter activity
through transcription factor(s), since some studies have

unraveled several transcriptional regulators of the CIP2A
promoter [35, 36]. Accordingly, MDA-MB-468 cells
were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs for
CIP2A promoter of varying lengths. As shown in Figure
4C, lapatinib signiﬁcantly downregulated the activity of
CIP2A promoter in cells transfected with constructs of
-1 to -2000, -1 to -1000, -1 to -400, -1 to -300 and -1 to
-150, respectively, while this promoter activity reduction
was not found when cells were transfected with constructs
of -1 to -62 and -1 to -110 bp. According to previous

studies [35, 36], Ets1 and Elk1 could bind to promoter
regions between -400 to -110 bp. Therefore, we performed
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) assay to
examine whether the binding of Ets1 or Elk1 (or both) to
CIP2A promoter was inhibited by lapatinib. We found that
lapatinib disturbed the binding of Elk1 to CIP2A promoter.
Further western blotting of Elk1 in nuclear/cytoplasmic
extracts from MDA-MB-468 cells treated with or without

lapatinib revealed that lapatinib reduced Elk-1 expression
in the nuclear extracts (Figure 4D). These data suggest
that lapatinib may decrease CIP2A transcription via
inhibiting the binding of Elk1 to the CIP2A promoter. We
also validate the role of Elk1 in lapatinib-induced CIP2A
inhibition by ectopic expression of Elk1 with pCMVElk1-GFP vector. As shown in Figure 4E, ectopic Elk1
expression upregulated CIP2A expression, and suppressed

xenograft tumor growth in vivo in association with CIP2A
downregulation. Third, lapatinib indirectly downregulated
CIP2A transcription by disturbing the binding of Elk1 to
the CIP2A promoter. These findings not only increase
current understanding of the drug mechanisms of lapatinib
but also support the rationale for targeting CIP2A in future
development of therapies for TNBC.
Our findings strengthen the evidence for the use of
CIP2A as an anti-cancer target. Several studies support
the use of CIP2A as an anticancer target [2-4, 10, 34, 3742]. Accordingly, several agents that inhibit CIP2A have
been identified, and some have demonstrated efficacy
against different cancer cells. In our previous studies, we
demonstrated that bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor,
induced apoptosis via proteasome-independent inhibition
of CIP2A in TNBC cells [13], hepatocellular carcinoma
cells [41], leukemia cells [34] and head and neck cancer
cells [40]. In this study, we found that lapatinib, a dual
tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2 and EGFR, induced
significant cancer cell apoptosis in TNBC (Figure 1). We
confirmed the role of the CIP2A/PP2A/p-Akt signaling
pathway in lapatinib-induced apoptosis in TNBC cells. It is
noteworthy the concentrations of lapatinib used in current
study were several fold higher than previous studies [31,
32], we also tested whether lapatinib had effects in TNBC
cells at lower concentrations. As shown in Supplement
Figure S1, lower concentrations of lapatinib (0.1 and 1
µM) had little effects on TNBC cells in terms of apoptosis
and CIP2A protein expression. This result suggested that
higher doses of lapatinib are required for lapatinib-induced
CIP2A inhibition and apoptosis in TNBC cells.
Prior studies have indicated the role of CIP2A in
senescence induction, that CIP2A may render breast
cancer cells resistance to senescence induction [16,
43]. Moreover, Come et al [3] has demonstrated that
CIP2A depletion by siRNA resulted in a decrease of the
anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB-231 cell. Li
et al [38] also showed CIP2A depletion by siRNA lead to
impaired clonogenicity and senescence in gastric cancer
cells. It would be interesting to see whether lapatinibinduced CIP2A downregulation is also associated with
clonogenicity and senescence. Accordingly, we performed
colony-forming assay and senescence-associated betagalactosidase (SA-β-gal) assay. As shown in Supplement
Figure S2, lapatinib at dose of 5 µM, but not at lower
doses (0.1 and 1 µM), significantly suppressed the colony
forming ability of MDA-MB-231 cells. The result was
in consistence with that by Chen et al [31], which also
showed that lapatinib at 1 µM did not suppress colony
forming ability of MDA-MB-231 cells (in their Figure
6B). In contrast, lapatinib induced only minor cell
senescent-phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells, and not in
a dose-dependent manner. Previously, Angelini et al [44]
showed that lapatinib could not revert the HER2-induced
senescence phenotype in a constitutive active HER2 (+)
(MCF7 Tet-Off/p95HER2) cells, whereas McDermott

Effect of lapatinib on triple negative breast cancer
xenograft tumor growth in vivo
In order to confirm that using lapatinib to inhibit
CIP2A is potentially clinical relevant in TNBC, we next
used TNBC xenograft models to evaluate the effect of
lapatinib in vivo. MDA-MB-468 xenograft was generated
to validate the role of CIP2A in vivo. After successfully
establishing the xenograft model in nude mice, these
tumor-bearing mice were treated with lapatinib at a
dose of 100 mg/kg or vehicle (as control) orally three
times weekly for 7 weeks. As shown in Figure 5A and
5B, lapatinib inhibited MDA-MB-468 tumor size and
tumor weight significantly. PP2A activity in MDAMB-468 xenografts treated with lapatinib increased
significantly compared with the control group (Figure
5C). Furthermore, the protein expression of CIP2A, p-Akt
and Akt were checked to confirm the correlation between
the biological response observed in vivo and the molecular
mechanism discovered in vitro. Lapatinib increased the
expression of CIP2A and p-Akt consistently in the three
representative MDA-MB-468 tumors, while no change
was seen in the control (vehicle)-treated tumors (Figure
5D). At the end of the experiment, all the animals had
tolerated the treatments quite well without observable
signs of toxicity and had stable body weights throughout
the whole treatment course (Figure 5E). Moreover,
we performed hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain, and
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for CIP2A, p-Akt
and the proliferative index Ki-67 in the MDA-MB-468
xenografts. As shown in Figure 5F, xenograft tumors from
lapatinib treatment group showed reduced expressions of
CIP2A, p-Akt, and ki-67 in the cancer cells population,
defined by HE stain (Figure 5F). A schema summarizing
the molecular mechanism of lapatinib in sensitive TNBC
cells is presented in Figure 5G. Lapatinib indirectly
inhibited CIP2A transcription by disturbing the binding
of Elk1 to the CIP2A promoter and restoring PP2A
activity, which led to p-Akt downregulation and cancer
cell apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated a novel mechanism
through which lapatinib induces apoptosis in TNBC cells,
i.e., through ELK-1-related CIP2A downregulation. We
further identified CIP2A as a major molecular determinant
of the apoptosis-inducing effect of lapatinib in TNBC cells.
First, we found that downregulation of CIP2A and p-Akt
correlated with lapatinib-induced apoptosis in TNBC
cells. Moreover, overexpression of CIP2A upregulated
p-AKT and protected sensitive MDA-MB-468 cells from
lapatinib-induced apoptosis. Second, lapatinib inhibited

et al [45] showed lapatinib induced senescent-like
phenotype in HER2 positive HCC1419 breast cancer cells.
Together with these findings and that lapatinib decreased
CIP2A at doses of 5 µM and higher, we suggested that
lapatinib-induced CIP2A inhibition may also suppress
clonogenicity in TNBC cells. It remains inconclusive the
role of lapatinib-induced CIP2A inhibition in senescence
induction and more studies are necessary.
Elk-1, a member of the ETS family of transcription
factors, is involved in a number of important cellular
processes in a number of normal tissues as well as in
many malignancies [46]. In particular, in cancer cells
Elk-1 has been shown to correlate with tumor progression
via activation of different genes that regulate cell growth,
differentiation, and survival [47, 48]. The role of Elk-1
in cancer cell formation has been progressively revealed
over the past few years [49-52]. Furthermore, Elk-1 has
been found to physiologically regulate CIP2A. Pallai et
al. demonstrated that Elk-1 and Ets-1 are both required
to coordinate binding to the proximal CIP2A promoter
for CIP2A expression in cervical, endometrial and liver
carcinoma cell lines [36]. In contrast, Khanna et al.
showed that only Ets-1 is required for the regulation of
CIP2A expression in prostate and gastric carcinoma [35].
It has been suggested that different transcription factors
regulate CIP2A expression in a cell-type specific manner.
According to the Figure 4C and 4D results, lapatinib
may disturb Elk1 binding to CIP2A promoter in TNBC
cells. Since Elk1 can also regulate Mcl-1 transcription,
an anti-apoptotic protein, by binding to Mcl-1 promoter
[53]. We used primers of Mcl-1 promoter as a positive
control for ChIP assay. As shown in Supplement Figure
S3, ChIP assay demonstrated that immunoprecipitated
Elk1 protein bound with Mcl-1 and CIP2A promoter DNA
fragments. Interestingly, lapatinib did not significantly
inhibit Elk1 binding to Mcl-1, suggesting lapatinib
disturbed Elk1-CIP2A but not Elk1-Mcl-1 protein-DNA
interaction, more studies are necessary to further dissect
the mechanism. However, non-specificity issues may exist
at relatively higher doses of lapatinib used in luciferase
promoter assays. We used luciferase reporter constructs
for Mcl-1 promoter (pGL2-Mcl-1) as a positive control
for luciferase promoter assays. As shown in Supplement
Figure S4, treatment with lapatinib at 5 µM suppressed
about one-fourth the luciferase reporter activity. As a
specific kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER2, lapatinib
has been demonstrated to affect multiple cellular
pathways downstream of EGFR and HER2 inhibition
[54, 55]. Moreover, Mcl-1 expression can be enhanced
by EGFR-dependent transcriptional regulation [56].
Therefore, it is possible that lapatinib decreased Mcl-1
promoter activity through EGFR-dependent signaling
or yet-to-be identified transcriptional signals other than
Elk1-Mcl-1. Nevertheless, we have validated the role
of Elk-1 in lapatinib-induced CIP2A downregulation;
ectopic Elk1 expression upregulated CIP2A expression,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and suppressed lapatinib-induced CIP2A downregulation
(Figure 4E). Based on aforementioned studies and our
results, we suggest that any attempt to therapeutically
decrease CIP2A expression through inhibition of specific
transcription factors will need to be guided by the type of
cancer that is being treated. These studies also suggested
that CIP2A regulation is quite complex and needs further
investigation to be thoroughly understood.
Because lapatinib is an EGFR/HER2 kinase
inhibitor, it would be interesting to see whether other
similar kinase inhibitors may also inhibit CIP2A
expression. We further tested neratinib (formally HKI272) and afatinib, both of which are pan epidermal
growth factor receptor (ErbB) family inhibitor [57], to
demonstrate their effects on p-EGFR, p-HER2 and on
CIP2A. As shown in supplement Figure S5, both neratinib
and afatinib decreased p-EGFR and p-HER2 but did not
inhibit CIP2A expression in SK-BR3 cells. In comparison,
lapatinib decreased CIP2A, p-EGFR, and p-HER2. All
three tyrosine kinase inhibitors induced apoptosis, as
evident by PARP cleavage. In line with the data shown in
Figure 1B that both anti-EGFR or anti-HER2 monoclonal
antibodies had no effects on CIP2A, our results suggested
lapatinib-induced CIP2A inhibition may not be necessarily
associated with tyrosine-kinase inhibition of EGFR and
HER2. However, more studies are needed to fully address
the correlation.
Although most clinical evidence suggests that
lapatinib is particularly effective for HER2-positive
breast cancer because it acts by reversible inhibition of
the HER2 receptor [19, 20, 22, 23], the antitumor effect
of lapatinib in HER2-negative breast cancer continues to
be of interest. EGFR expression has been reported to exist
in 45% to 76% of cases of TNBC [58-61]. The selective
EGFR-targeting and clinical benefit of lapatinib in cancer
progression and metastasis indicate that lapatinib might
be a candidate therapeutic drug for TNBC. Unfortunately,
the antiproliferative effect of lapatinib on TNBC cells
in vitro did not transfer into solid efficacy in vivo. Chen
et al [31] showed that lapatinib (at dose of 1 µM) could
induce nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation, independent
of EGFR/HER2 inhibition, in TNBCs. They found that
lapatinib, but not other EGFR inhibitors synergized
the anti-tumor activity of proteasome inhibitors both in
vitro and in vivo, suggesting that treatment of TNBCs
with lapatinib may enhance their oncogene addiction
to NF-κB, and thus augment the anti-tumor activity of
proteasome inhibitors. On the other hand, Hsia et al found
an opposing effect of lapatinib in TNBC that lapatinib may
increase the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231
cells by upregulating EGFR and COX-2 through the
downregulation of microRNA-7, providing a potential
explanation for the worse clinical outcome of TNBC
patients who receive lapatinib-based treatment [62]. It
remains unknown whether and how lapatinib elicits the
aggressiveness of such cancer cells. Meanwhile, it would
9143

be interesting to see cells that may be resistant to lapatinibinduced CIP2A inhibition and discover the resistance
mechanism in the future.
The current study also has some limitation. First,
despite we showed Elk1 plays a role in lapatinib-induced
CIP2A inhibition (Figure 4D to 4E), the detail mechanism
by which lapatinib suppresses the CIP2A promoter remains
unsolved thereby represents a limitation of current study.
Future experiments using a site-directed mutagenesis of
the specific cellular component that is affected or brought
into action following the treatment of lapatinib may help
delineate the mechanism. Secondly, whereas we showed
siRNA PP2Ac treatment reduced lapatinib-induced
decrease of p-Akt (Figure 3D), the lowering of p-Akt can
also be contributed by lapatinib’s kinase-inhibitory effects
on the EGFR/HER2 signaling pathways (independent of
CIP2A-PP2A axis). Moreover, although various studies
have indicated the clinical relevance and prognostic value
of CIP2A in various cancers [1, 15], its implication as
a therapeutic target for TNBC remains to be validated.
We also performed in silico analysis of CIP2A mRNA
expression (mRNA seq v2) from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) public data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.
gov/tcga/). As shown in Supplement Figure S6, Elk1 and
CIP2A showed higher mRNA expression in tumor versus
adjacent normal tissue from all breast cancer patient
samples, from paired tumor/normal tissue and from the
TNBC subpopulation. Future more clinical studies are
required to identify CIP2A upregulation or overexpression
specifically in patients with TNBC and correlate the
expression or downstream function of the protein with the
clinical outcome in these patients.

tablets obtained from GlaxoSmithKline (London, UK)
were used for in vivo animal experiments. For in vitro
studies, lapatinib at various concentrations was dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to cells in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). The final DMSO concentration
was 0.1% after addition to the medium. Antibodies for
immunoblotting of CIP2A and ER-α, Ets1, and Elk1 were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego,
CA, USA).. Other antibodies such as Akt, p-Akt (Ser473),
caspase 3 and Myc-tag were obtained from Cell Signaling
(Danvers, MA, USA).

CONCLUSIONS

Drug-induced apoptotic cell death was assessed
using measurement of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry
(sub-G1 analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells) and
western blot analysis of caspase 3 cleavage.

Cell culture and western blot analysis
The HCC-1937, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468,
SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).
All breast cancer cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10%
FBS, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 2 mM
L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 µg/mL
streptomycin sulfate, and 25 µg/mL amphotericin B in a
37°C humidified incubator and an atmosphere of 5% CO2
in air. Lysates of breast cancer cells treated with drugs at
the indicated concentrations for various periods of time
were prepared for immunoblotting of p-Akt, Akt, CIP2A,
etc. Western blot analysis was performed as previously
reported [13].

Apoptosis analysis

Lapatinib shows a favorable apoptosis-inducing
effect in TNBC cells through a novel mechanism, i.e., the
Elk-1/CIP2A/PP2A/p-Akt pathway. This study strengthens
the notion that CIP2A is a major molecular determinant
of the sensitivity of TNBC cells to lapatinib-induced
apoptosis. Targeting the interactions of transcription
factors, oncoproteins, phosphatases and kinases could be
a novel anti-cancer strategy. Future studies to explicate the
mechanism by which lapatinib inhibits Elk-1 may lead to
further progress in the development of molecular-targeted
therapies for TNBC.

Generation of MDA-MB-468 cells with ectopically
expressed CIP2A
CIP2A cDNA (gene name KIAA1524) was
purchased from Origene (RC219918; Rockville, MD,
USA) and constructed into pCMV6 vector. MDAMB-468 cells were transfected with myc-tagged CIP2A as
previously described [30]. Briefly, following transfection,
cells were incubated in the presence of Geneticin (G418,
1.40 mg/mL, Invitrogen). After 8 weeks of selection,
surviving colonies, i.e., those arising from stably
transfected cells were selected and individually amplified.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and antibodies

Oncotarget

assay kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described
[30]. In brief, drug-treated or control cells were lysed
and PP2A was immunoprecipitated with anti-PP2A C
subunit antibodies and protein A agarose beads overnight.
Protein phosphatase activity of PP2A was determined by
measuring the generation of free phosphate from threonine
phosphopeptide using the malachite green-phosphate
complex assay. To avoid variability due to differences
in the amounts of immunoprecipitated protein between
samples, the phosphatase activities were normalized to
the amount of PP2A immunoprecipitated, as detected and
quantified by immunoblot analysis for each treatment
group.

min); phosphatase inhibitor and protease inhibitor were
added in the cell lysis step to avoid protein degradation.
Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,500 × g
for 5 min at 4°C. Immunoprecipitation was performed
by adding Elk1, Ets1 or rabbit IgG antibodies as the
negative control. The immunocomplex was precipitated
by incubation with 25 μl of protein A/G magnetic beads
for 1 h at 4°C. The protein/DNA complex was eluted using
200 μl of elution buffer from the beads. Cross-linking of
protein-DNA was reversed by adding 8 μl of 5 M NaCl at
95°C for 15 minutes. The DNA was purified using spin
columns and 2 μl of the DNA was used in the semi-PCR
reaction for amplification of the CIP2A promoter region
(-139/-16 bp). Anti-RNA polymerase II antibody and
GAPDH primers were provided by the manufacturer as a
positive control for assay technique and reagent integrity.

Luciferase reporter constructs for the CIP2A
promoter and 5’ detection analysis

Xenograft tumor growth

The upstream region of the CIP2A promoter
containing exon 1 (-2000 bp to -1 bp) was amplified by
PCR from the genomic DNA of cells and cloned into
the reporter vector, Firefly vector (pGL4.17, Promega,
Madison, WI) by KpnI and Bgl II restriction sites. PCR
amplified promoter regions -2000/-1, -400/-1, -110/-1,
-62/-1, were cloned into the KpnI and Bgl II restriction
sites of the pGL4-basic vector. The nucleotide sequence
of the clones was verified by sequencing.

Female NCr athymic nude mice (5-7 weeks of
age) were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal
Center (Taipei, Taiwan, ROC). The mice were housed
in groups and maintained in an SPF-environment.
All experimental procedures using these mice were
performed in accordance with protocols approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei
Veterans General Hospital. Each mouse was inoculated
orthotopically to the mice mammary pads with 5 × 106
breast cancer cells suspended in 0.1 mL serum-free
medium containing 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Bedford, MA) under isoflurane anesthesia. Tumors were
measured using calipers and their volumes calculated
using a standard formula: width2 × length × 0.52. When
tumors reached around 200 mm3, mice were administered
orally with 100 mg/kg body weight lapatinib three times
weekly for 7 weeks. Controls received vehicle (1×
phosphate buffered saline). Upon termination of treatment,
mice were sacrificed and xenografted tumors were
harvested and assayed for tumor weight, PP2A activity,
and molecular events by western blot analysis.

Dual-luciferase reporter assay
The promoter activity of CIP2A was determined
using the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega,
Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. MDA-MB-468 cells were co-transfected
with the luciferase reporter constructs pGL4.17-CIP2Apromoter (Firefly fluorescence reporter) and PGL4.74renilla (Renilla fluorescence reporter) as an indicator of
normalization of transfection efficiency. Twenty-four
hours post-transfection, cells were treated with lapatinib
(5 µM) or DMSO for 24 hours. Cells were then lysed and
assayed for luciferase activity. The promoter activity was
repeated three times in parallel for statistical analysis.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using
TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and RTPCR was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). RT-PCR
analyses were performed as previously described [13],
using specific primers for human CIP2A (forward primer,
5′-TGGCAAGATTGACCTGGGATTTGGA-3′; reverse
primer, 5′-AGGAGTAATCAAACGTGGGTCCTGA-3′;
172 bps), and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed
using Pierce Agarose ChIP Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, 1 × 107 MDA-MB-468 cells were
treated with lapatinib (5 µM) or DMSO for 24 hours.
Physical cross-linking between chromatin (DNA)
and proteins was fixed by 1% formaldehyde at room
temperature for 10 min. Then, cells were lysed for DNA
