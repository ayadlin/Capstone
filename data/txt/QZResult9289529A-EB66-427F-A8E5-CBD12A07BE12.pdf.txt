ABSTRACT:
Current therapeutic regimens attempt to eliminate all malignant cells of a melanoma
lesion. Pre-clinical data, however, indicate that melanoma is maintained by a minor
subset of cancer cells, which are characterized by CD20 expression. We attempted
to eliminate those cells in a progressing, chemotherapy-refractory metastatic
melanoma patient by lesional injections of the anti-CD20 therapeutic antibody
rituximab and concomitant dacarbazine treatment, which was ineffective as
monotherapy. Although the frequency of CD20+ melanoma cells within the tumor
lesions was initially about 2% and the bulk of tumor cells did not express CD20,
rituximab treatment produced lasting remission accompanied by a decline of the
melanoma serum marker S-100 to physiological levels. Detailed in-depth-analyses
revealed a switch of serum cytokines from a T helper-2 to a pro-inflammatory T
helper-1 cell profile. Apart from B cell elimination and decline in gammaglobulin
levels, no grade 3/4 toxicity related to treatment was observed. Data provide
the first clinical evidence that targeting the minor subset of CD20+ “melanoma
sustaining cells” produces regression of chemotherapy-refractory melanoma and
highlight the potency of selective cancer cell targeting in the treatment of melanoma.

INTRODUCTION

after treatment [2]. For instance, metastatic relapse of
melanoma can occur more than a decade after curative
surgical treatment of the primary lesion; this phenomenon
is thought to be due to the same cancer initiating cell that
drives cancer progression.
Although cancer stem cells have been experimentally
proven for a variety of solid tumors and leukemia by
their functional capacities, they do not share a common
marker. In the melanoma CD20 was first reported to
be expressed on those cells [3]; other reports showed
ABCB5 [4], CD271 [5] and other markers depending on
the assay used to test for cancer stem capacities. These
tumor-initiating cells may be variable in number and must
not necessarily be rare in the case of melanomas [6,7].

Current regimens in cancer therapy attempt to
eliminate all malignant cells of a tumor lesion; the
approach is based on the assumption that every cancer
cell has equal malignant capacities. The contrary paradigm
that an established tumor lesion is hierarchically organized
is supported by the enormous cellular heterogeneity of
tumor lesions with a minority of tumor cells, but not a
random cancer cell, which populates the tumor cell mass,
initiates tumor growth and drives progression [1]. Cancer
initiating cells renew themselves, are more resistant to
chemo- and radiotherapy, stay quiescent for long time,
and drift to distant sites to initiate metastases and relapse

RESULTS

Moreover, melanoma cells exhibit a remarkable plasticity
since isolated melanoma cells of different phenotypes can
initiate new tumor lesions by asymmetric cell divisions
when transplanted under appropriate conditions. Once
established, however, a minor subset of melanoma cells
seems to maintain tumor progression. A major implication
thereof is that specific elimination of the minor side
population with tumor progression capacities may be
sufficient to shrink the tumor in the long term. The
assumption is sustained by mathematical models implying
that successful tumor therapy requires eradication of those
stem cells to produce complete clinical response [8]. A
strong rationale for selective cancer cell elimination in
melanoma therapy was most recently provided by the
observation that targeted elimination of the less than 2%
subset of CD20+ melanoma cells in a transplantation model
can lastingly eradicate the tumor lesion [9,10]. While
those pre-clinical data imply CD20+ melanoma cells as
the major driver of melanoma progression, we here firstly
report complete remission of melanoma upon targeting of
the CD20+ subset of melanoma cells by the CD20-specific
therapeutic antibody rituximab in off-label use in a patient
with advanced metastatic melanoma.

Case Report
The patient, a 74-aged Caucasian male, received
a diagnosis of stage IIIB (AJCC) ulcerated, acrolentiginous malignant melanoma on the left heel with a
tumor thickness of 2.0 mm in May 2010. Surgical tumor
excision was conducted with a 3 cm margin. Inguinal
lymph nodes were infiltrated with tumor cells, whereas
popliteal lymph nodes were found to be free of tumor
cells by lymph node scintigraphy and sentinel lymph node
biopsy. Tumor cells exhibited wild-type alleles of BRAF
and c-Kit as revealed by RT-PCR. The patient received
adjuvant therapy with interferon-alpha (3 mio. IU s.c.
three times a week) from August to October 2010. Left
inguinal lymphadenopathy enforced lymphadenectomy
in November 2010 with extirpation of 5 lymph nodes;
three of them with metastatic infiltrations, one of which
extended beyond the lymph node capsule. In February
2011, the patient progressed into AJCC stage IV (M1a)

with disseminated lymph node metastases and multiple
widespread cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases. The
patient’s skin and lymph node metastases still progressed
during two further cycles of therapy with dacarbazine
(1 g/m2 every 4 weeks) combined with epifocal
dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) treatment in increasing
doses from 0.1% up to 2% once per week accordingly
to Trcka et al [11]. The patient did not meet inclusion
criteria of ongoing trials. In May 2011, the patient was
enrolled in an off-label use of rituximab according to the
treatment schedule Table 1. The procedure was reviewed
and approved by the institutional “Tumor Review Board
of the Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO)”, University
Hospital of Cologne.

each lesion with a total dose of 10 – 20 mg rituximab.
The same procedure was repeated at day 15, 20 and 29. At
day 36, injected dose of rituximab was increased to 40 80 mg per lesion and repeated 12 days later. The ongoing
treatment with dacarbazine (1 g/m2) every four weeks
was continued and administered on days 20 and 48. Aside
from minimal swelling due to the injection volume, no
local or systemic toxicity was observed. Rituximab was
administered by i.v. injection in a dose of 187.5 mg/m² at
day 101 and in a dose of 375 mg/m² at day 129 followed
by local injections into the inguinal lesion at day 187 and
day 194. The remaining inguinal lesion was removed by
surgery at day 228.

Clinical response and evaluations

Therapeutic anti-CD20 antibody injections

Cutaneous melanoma lesions and metastases
continuously progressed during treatment with
dacarbazine and DNCB. After 7 courses of rituximab
injections, however, treated metastases had substantially
regressed or were no longer detectable (Table 1).
Histological screening of a treated lesion in far distance
from the first biopsy confirmed morphological destruction
of the melanoma tissue; no CD20+ melanoma cells were
detected (Fig. 1). Interestingly, no substantial infiltration
by immune cells occurred during treatment. Sonographic
recording confirmed continuous regression of a left
popliteal metastasis from approximately 38 x 19 mm to
15 x 9 mm in diameter within the course of 7 rituximab

A cutaneous melanoma lesion from the left heel was
subjected to immunohistological screening for CD20+
melanoma cells. As shown in Fig. 1, a minority of cells in
the melanoma lesion expressed CD20 which represented
about 2% of melanoma cells. The patient was subjected to
off-label therapy with intra-lesional rituximab injections
after informed consent. Treatment started with rituximab
injections at a total dose of 20 mg into a cutaneous
metastasis at the left heel and 30 mg into metastases in the
popliteal region (for treatment schedule see Table 1). Since
no toxicity was observed, the same lesions were treated
again at day 7 together with an additional inguinal lesion,

treatments (Fig. 2). Regression of melanoma lesions
was furthermore objectified by MRI scan as exemplarily
shown in Fig. 3. Both popliteal metastases regressed
during treatment and complete remission was achieved
within 7 months of rituximab therapy. Although they
had not received intra-tumoral injections, the inguinal
metastasis regressed during therapy as well (Fig. 4). While
the metastasis progressed during chemotherapy from 15
mm to 19 mm in diameter within 3 months, they regressed
to 9 mm as revealed by CT scans and was removed by
surgery 7 months after first rituximab treatment (Fig. 4).
Along with the regression of metastatic melanoma
lesions, serum S-100, a marker for melanoma progression,
declined during rituximab therapy from 1.78 µg/l to
near physiological levels (0.23 - 0.11 µg/l) (Fig. 5).
Other serum enzymes including LDH and AP were in
the physiological range. Recording of peripheral blood
immune cells revealed complete depletion of CD19+ B
cells, accompanied by decline in gamma-globulin levels,
which was most likely due to rituximab targeting healthy
B cells. CD4:CD8 T cell ratio was increased with increase

before rituximab treatment

in CD4+ helper T cells to 81% and decrease in effector
CD8+ T cells to 7%. Before rituximab treatment the panel
of serum cytokines indicated a predominant TH2 immune
status which changed to a more pro-inflammatory TH1
cytokine signature at day 82 after rituximab treatment
indicated by increase in IFN-γ, TNF-α, and other
cytokines including IL-12 (Table 2). The elevated number
of CD4+ helper T cells was accompanied by increased
serum levels of IL-1β, IL-9, IL-10 and eotaxin pointing
on their increased functional activity. The anti-angiogenic
factor CXCL10 was additionally increased after rituximab
treatment which together with a decreased VEGF level
likely contributes to the shrinkage of the melanoma
lesions.

DISCUSSION
We report that local treatment with the therapeutic
anti-CD20 antibody rituximab produced complete
regression of all melanoma metastases with the exception

The observation is unexpected since the melanoma
metastases were continuously progressing during
chemotherapy while rituximab therapy targeted CD20+
melanoma cells which comprised about 2% of cells in
the lesions whereas the majority of melanoma cells lack
CD20. After the elimination of CD20+ melanoma cells,
notably, the number of CD20- melanoma cells declined
accompanied by a decrease in the S-100 serum marker to
near physiological levels.

evident tumor regression. Indeed, the injected doses
of 10 - 40 mg rituximab per lesion once a week were
several orders of magnitude below doses used in current
lymphoma therapy in which rituximab is systemically
administered [12]. Subcutaneous drug injections, almost
produce some systemic leachate, even when the drug
is administered at low doses, which explains tumor
shrinkage at remote sites. The conclusion is sustained by
the fact that locally injected rituximab was sufficient to
clear healthy CD20+ B cells from the peripheral blood
circulation in long-term as indicated by flow cytometric
decline in B cell counts and the gradual decline in serum

gamma-globulin levels. Loss of regulatory B cells and
concomitant augmented T cell immunity, however, may
contribute to but are unlikely to be entirely responsible
for the effect since tumor shrinkage was observed before
decline in blood B cell counts. B cell lymphopenia as a
side effect of targeting CD20+ melanoma cells did not
produce recurrent infections in the patient and we expect
B cell repopulation after discontinuation of treatment as
known in rituximab lymphoma therapy [12].
Melanoma regression is likely accompanied by
a concerted action of various anti-tumor mechanisms
including a cellular immune response and vascular remodeling. The assumption is sustained by our observation
that serum cytokine levels changed from a pronounced
TH2 signature before rituximab therapy to a more proinflammatory TH1 signature with a nearly 8fold increase
in IFN-γ and TNF-α levels indicating a strong induction
of an adaptive immune cell response. Concomitantly, the
functional activity of CD4+ helper T cells was improved
indicated by increased serum levels of IL-1β, IL-9, IL10 and eotaxin. We did not observe, however, autoimmune destruction of melanocytes resulting in vitilgo
which is thought to be a side effect of anti-melanoma
T cell response and is now discussed to play a role in
supporting T cell responses to melanoma (13). Increased
IL-12, on the other hand, contributes to boost the innate
immune response while the increase of the anti-angiogenic
factor CXCL10 together with a decreased VEGF
level counteracts neo-angiogenesis and thereby likely
contributes to the observed shrinkage of the melanoma
lesions.
The therapeutic effect, however, is unlikely due to
the concomitant dacarbazine therapy since melanoma
lesions continuously progressed for 3 months during
that treatment while stopped progression and turned into
regression after the rituximab administration. Low dose
dacarbazine treatment, however, may potentiate the effects
of rituximab to some extent, for instance by sensitizing
tumor cells which would otherwise survive therapy.
Whether this or other pre-treatment regimens would
further increase the anti-melanoma activity of rituximab
remains to be resolved.
Whereas the cancer stem cell concept has thus
far been based on pre-clinical models, the present data
provide the first clinical evidence for a hierarchical tumor
cell organization in an established melanoma lesion,
in particular the predominance of CD20+ melanoma
cells as the “master cell” required for maintaining and
promoting an established melanoma lesion. The crucial
feature of the therapeutic approach is that the minority
of CD20+ melanoma cells needs to be therapeutically
targeted to produce regression of the melanoma lesion
as a whole. Recent data from our group [9] based on a
pre-clinical transplantation mouse model provide strong
evidence that T cell targeted elimination of the minority
of CD20+ melanoma cells prohibit melanoma progression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resulting in the eradication of the disease whereas the
mass of cancer cells is not therapeutically targeted.
Moreover, mathematical models which simulate the effect
of targeting different tumor subset cells [8] support our
observation that elimination of tumor-maintaining “master
cells” is both required and sufficient to induce tumor
regression, whereas increase in the death rate or decrease
in the production of mature tumor cells may be auxiliary
but inadequate to eradicate progressively growing
cancer lesions when used alone. The delayed onset of
tumor shrinkage after rituximab therapy is expected in
this context. These models, however, do so far not take
the plasticity of cancer cells into account, meaning that
differentiated tumor stem cells may acquire stem cell
properties when gaining access to the stem cell niche
(14). Consequently, anti-stem cell therapy needs to be
repetitively applied to eliminate those reverting cells and
provides the rationale to administer rituximab repetitively
over a longer period of time in our patient.
The same melanoma subset cells may be targeted by
other therapeutic anti-CD20 antibodies like ofatumumab
or the next generation antibody GA-101 which possibly
show more potent in the therapy of chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (15). Instead of antibodies, CD20-specific
cytolytic T cells can be adoptively transferred which were
engineered by expression of a recombinant T cell receptor
or a chimeric antigen receptor; the latter was recently
explored in a pre-clinical model [9]. Unlike cell-based
therapies, antibody-mediated therapy has the benefit that
antibody doses can be controlled in serum levels and are
cleared with a defined half-life which is crucial in case
of adverse events. Drug discovery approaches to target
crucial signaling pathways in cancer stem cells including
the Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathway are
currently explored at various levels (16). Complete
response of chemotherapy-resistant melanoma highlights
the potency of selectively eliminating tumor sustaining
cells and warrants exploration of a greater patient cohort.

Serum cytokines

REFERENCES

The concentration of a panel of 27 cytokines and
chemokines in patient sera was determined using the
“Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-Plex Panel” (Bio-Rad,
Munich, Germany) and the “Luminex Reader” according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cutaneous melanoma metastases on the lateral part
of the left ankle, subcutaneous metastases in the left
dorsal popliteal region and in the left inguinal region
were treated by intra-lesional rituximab injections
(10 mg in 4 ml NaCl 0.9%). Treated areas were first
disinfected and anesthetized with a 2% (v/v) xylocaine
injection. Rituximab doses and the treatment schedule are
summarized in Table 1. No treatment related side effects
occurred. Ongoing i.v. dacarbazine (1 g/m2 in 1L NaCl
0.9%) treatment was repeated at monthly intervals. Premedication was performed with granisetron (1 mg) and
dexamethason (4 mg). Blood and serum samples were
analyzed in the accredited Central Laboratory at the
University Hospital Cologne.
