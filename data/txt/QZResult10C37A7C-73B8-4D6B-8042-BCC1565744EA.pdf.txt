Abstract
The emergence of drug resistance is a primary concern in any cancer treatment, including with targeted kinase
inhibitors as exemplified by the appearance of Bcr-Abl point mutations in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
patients treated with imatinib. In vitro approaches to identify resistance mutations in Bcr-Abl have yielded
mutation spectra that faithfully recapitulated clinical observations. To predict resistance mutations in the receptor
tyrosine kinase MET that could emerge during inhibitor treatment in patients, we conducted a resistance screen in
BaF3 TPR-MET cells using the novel selective MET inhibitor NVP-BVU972. The observed spectrum of mutations in
resistant cells was dominated by substitutions of tyrosine 1230 but also included other missense mutations and
partially overlapped with activating MET mutations that were previously described in cancer patients. Cocrystallization of the MET kinase domain in complex with NVP-BVU972 revealed a key role for Y1230 in binding of
NVP-BVU972, as previously reported for multiple other selective MET inhibitors. A second resistance screen in
the same format with the MET inhibitor AMG 458 yielded a distinct spectrum of mutations rich in F1200
alterations, which is consistent with a different predicted binding mode. Our findings suggest that amino acid
substitutions in the MET kinase domain of cancer patients need to be carefully monitored before and during
treatment with MET inhibitors, as resistance may preexist or emerge. Compounds binding in the same manner
as NVP-BVU972 might be particularly susceptible to the development of resistance through mutations in Y1230, a
condition that may be addressed by MET inhibitors with alternative binding modes. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5255–64.

Several kinase inhibitors are approved medications, such as
imatinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML), and numerous others are in preclinical or clinical
development. Despite remarkable success in specific cancer
indications, where the respective target kinase confers cancer
dependence, a recurrent problem encountered in clinical
practice is the emergence of resistance. Often resistance
results from kinase mutations that interfere with inhibitor
binding without compromising kinase function. This is particularly well documented in the case of CML therapy with
imatinib, where multiple mutations in the target protein BcrAbl conferring various degrees of resistance have been isolated
from patients (1, 2). Likewise, resistance mutations have been
reported in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors that
were treated with imatinib (3). In case of Bcr-Abl, the secondgeneration inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib are now available. These compounds overcome the majority of imatinib
resistance mutations with the notable exception of the crossresistant gatekeeper mutation T315I (2, 4). The corresponding
gatekeeper mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), T790M, has also been found to cause resistance to
the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in
lung cancer (5).

Tiedt et al.

In vitro identification of resistance mutations in Bcr-Abl has
been reported in a number of studies. One successful
approach was to generate a library of mutant Bcr-Abl constructs by passaging a retroviral vector containing wild-type
Bcr-Abl through the mutagenic Escherichia coli strain XL-1 red
(6, 7). Mutated Bcr-Abl constructs were then expressed in
BaF3 cells to select inhibitor-resistant clones. One advantage
of this method is that one can estimate the complexity of the
library of mutants and thus the coverage of the respective
kinase. Another example where this methodology was applied
successfully is the recent identification of resistance mutations in MEK1 by expressing a saturating cDNA library of
mutants in a MEK inhibitor–sensitive lung cancer cell line (8).
In an alternative protocol, BaF3 cells transformed with an
oncogenic kinase are directly mutagenized by exposing them
to the alkylating agent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Subsequently, resistant cells can be selected by incubation with an
inhibitor of choice (9, 10). Such a cell-based resistance screen
could potentially yield mutations in genes other than the
kinase of interest, and an estimation of mutation coverage
is more difficult to obtain. However, this simpler method was
shown to faithfully reproduce the spectrum of mutations in
Bcr-Abl that was observed in imatinib-resistant patients (9). A
similar cell-based resistance screen with nilotinib yielded a
comparable mutation profile even in the absence of ENU (11),
suggesting that at least in Bcr-Abl–driven BaF3 cells, the rate
of spontaneous mutations is sufficiently high to screen for
resistance.
The receptor tyrosine kinase MET has been linked to cancer
by numerous findings, including the presence of activating
mutations in cancer patients, hyperactivation due to gene
amplification, as well as autocrine growth stimulation by the
ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in certain tumor
models (12). Accordingly, several agents targeting the
MET–HGF axis are in preclinical and clinical development
for cancer treatment (13). Here, we sought to predict resistance mutations in MET that may emerge upon exposure to
the highly selective inhibitor NVP-BVU972. The strategy we
used was based on the previously described Bcr-Abl ENU
mutagenesis screens in BaF3 cells (9, 10), in this case however
using BaF3 cells driven by the oncogenic TPR-MET fusion
gene, in which the MET kinase domain is constitutively
activated. These cells are strictly dependent on MET kinase
activity (14) and therefore highly sensitive to MET inhibitors
like NVP-BVU972. A screen with various concentrations of
NVP-BVU972 resulted in isolation of 85 resistant BaF3 TPRMET clones containing 10 different mutations in the MET
kinase domain. The vast majority of mutations were found in
residues Y1230 and D1228. Cocrystallization of NVP-BVU972
and the MET kinase domain provided a clear explanation for
the observed mutation profile and revealed a binding mode
that is very similar to several other MET inhibitors that are in
clinical or preclinical development. A similar screen with the
MET inhibitor AMG 458 yielded a distinct spectrum of mutations, which is likely due to its different binding mode. Finally,
screens were repeated and the resultant cell populations
pooled and sequenced using next generation sequencing
(NGS) technologies. The observed mutation spectra largely

Resistance Mutations in the MET Kinase

X-ray crystallography
MET crystals were produced by microseeding at 18 C by
the hanging drop method. Purified MET kinase (5 mg/mL) in
20 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, and
3 mmol/L Tris (2-carboxy-ethyl) phosphin HCl (TCEP) was
incubated with 0.5 mmol/L NVP-BVU972 and was mixed at a
ratio of 1:1:0.2 with reservoir solution (100 mmol/L HEPES,
pH 7.5, 16% PEG4000, 8% isopropanol, and 3 mmol/L TCEP)
and MET microseeds. Crystals appeared overnight, continued to grow for approximately 3 to 5 days, and were
transferred to 100 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.2, 20% PEG4000,
and 20% glycerol before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen.
Data were collected at beam line 5.0.2 of the Advanced Light
Source (Berkeley, California), integrated with X-ray Detector
Software (XDS; ref. 17), and scaled with SCALA (18).
The structure was solved by molecular replacement with
PHASER (19) and refined with PHENIX (20) and BUSTER
(21). Iterative rounds of model building were done with
COOT (22).

remaining 2 mL of expanded cells were cryopreserved for
later analysis. For sequence analysis, a DNA fragment covering the entire kinase domain of MET was amplified with a
PCR Master kit (Roche) using the primers 50 -AAATACTGTCC-ACATTGACCTC-30 and 50 -GCCAGCATTTTAGCATTACTTC-30 , yielding an 818-bp product. PCR products
were then purified with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and sequenced by standard Sanger sequencing using
the reverse PCR primer. Mutations were identified by alignment to the National Center for Biotechnology Information

mg/mL. All the material that came in contact with ENU was
decontaminated with 0.2 mol/L NaOH. Per one resistance
screen, approximately 1.5  108 BaF3 TPR-MET cells in a
total of 160 mL growth media were exposed to a final
concentration of 50 mg/mL ENU. After approximately 16
hours, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and
split into 5 aliquots of 3  107 cells each. Compound (NVPBVU972 or AMG 458) was added to a final concentration of
600, 1,200, 2,400, 4,800, or 9,600 nmol/L, and cells of each
aliquot were distributed into three 96-well plates, thereby
placing 105 cells in 100 mL media into each well. Plates were
incubated over a course of 4 weeks with regular inspection.
When clear signs of cell outgrowth were observed in the
microscope and by color change of the media, the respective
well content was transferred into 3 mL of growth media
containing the original concentration of MET inhibitor on a
6-well plate. After approximately 1 week of expansion, the
cell number was sufficient for further processing (see below).

kinase assays, or even greater than 10 mmol/L in 56 of these
assays including the most closely related kinase RON (Table 1).
Growth inhibition of the MET gene amplified cell lines GTL-16,
MKN-45, and EBC-1 (23, 24) as well as suppression of constitutive MET phosphorylation in GTL-16 cells or HGF-stimulated MET phosphorylation in A549 cells was detected in a
concentration range that was only slightly above the biochemical activity (Table 1). Furthermore, growth inhibition with low
nanomolar potency was also seen in BaF3 cells transformed
with a TPR-MET fusion (14) but not in BaF3 wild-type cells
grown in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3) or in 13 other
BaF3 cell models transformed with different activated tyrosine
kinases (Table 1). These biochemical and cellular data show
that NVP-BVU972 is a selective and potent MET inhibitor.
Selection of BaF3 TPR-MET cells that are resistant to
NVP-BVU972
To predict MET mutations that might cause resistance to
NVP-BVU972 in MET driven cancers, we conducted a random
mutagenesis screen in BaF3 TPR-MET cells. To this end, we
exposed mutagenized BaF3 TPR-MET cells in 96-well plates to
various concentrations of NVP-BVU972 ranging from 600
nmol/L to 9.6 mmol/L. In this concentration range, the IC50
value for inhibition of proliferation is exceeded by about 6- to
100-fold. Between 2 and 4 weeks after initial plating, resistant
cells were isolated from single wells that showed evidence of
growth based on media color change and microscopic observations. After expansion in fresh media containing the initial
drug concentrations, DNA for sequencing was extracted and
an aliquot from each well was cryopreserved for functional
characterization. Within a 4-week period, cells grew in 85 of
1,440 wells (5.9%). The relative scarcity of positive wells,
together with the microscopic observation that living cells
generally appeared to originate from a single center, suggested
that each well represented an individual resistant clone.
PCR amplification and sequencing of the complete MET
kinase domain from all 85 wells with outgrowing cells revealed
a total of 10 mutations in 4 different amino acid residues
(Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S1). Four of these 10
mutations had previously been reported in cancer patients.
Y1230 mutations (88%) were dominating at all concentrations
of NVP-BVU972, followed by D1228 (9%) and the overall yield
of clones decreased significantly at the 2 highest concentrations (Fig. 1C). Except for 1 clone with a dual Y1230H/M1211V
mutation, all clones contained exactly 1 point mutation in the
kinase domain of TPR-MET (Supplementary Fig. S1), further
supporting the hypothesis that only single clones were
obtained. Sequence traces of 83 of 85 clones showed a
wild-type peak of approximately the same intensity as the
mutant peak, resembling a heterozygous SNP. Only 2 clones, 1
with a Y1230N and 1 with a Y1230C mutation, lacked the wildtype peak. This observation could be explained by the presence of 2 TPR-MET copies in the initial BaF3 strain. It
appears that 1 mutant copy of TPR-MET is sufficient to cause
resistance despite the retention of 1 wild-type copy. It is also
interesting to note that the susceptibility of developing
resistance to NVP-BVU972 primarily through mutations at
Y1230 is underscored by the fact that all possible amino acid

5258

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

substitutions (with the exception of Y1230F) arising from a
single-nucleotide change were detected.
Cocrystal structure of the MET kinase domain and NVPBVU972 explains frequently observed resistance
mutations
The binding mode of NVP-BVU972 to the MET kinase
domain was determined by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 2).
An important binding interaction is the p-stacking of the
core imidazo-pyridazine moiety of NVP-BVU972 with the
aromatic side chain of Y1230, explaining why mutations of
this residue abrogate binding of the compound and lead to
resistance in biochemical and cellular assays. The 3 other
residues that were found to be mutated in resistant clones
play a role in stabilizing the particular conformation of the
activation loop seen in the cocrystal structure: D1228 is
engaged in a hydrogen bond with K1110, whereas V1155
and F1200 are involved in hydrophobic interactions with
activation loop residues L1225 and F1223, respectively. All 3
interactions appear to be important to keep the activation
loop in a conformation allowing for the critical p-stacking
interaction between Y1230 and NVP-BVU972.
Mutation spectra obtained with the MET inhibitors
NVP-BVU972 and AMG 458 are partially overlapping
To further explore the utility of the BaF3 resistance screening system, we conducted a second resistance screen with
AMG 458, a MET inhibitor that is structurally distinct from
NVP-BVU972 and predicted to bind MET in a different fashion. The same experimental setup and concentration range
as for NVP-BVU972 were used. The previously observed
outgrowth of clones in a subset of wells was only seen at
2.4 mmol/L of AMG 458 and to a lesser extent at 4.8 mmol/L,

Resistance Mutations in the MET Kinase

whereas the 2 lowest concentrations were insufficient for
complete growth suppression and 9.6 mmol/L AMG 458 did
not allow growth of any clones (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Between 2 and 4 weeks after plating, more than 50% of wells
showed signs of growth at 2.4 mmol/L and below. A random
selection of 99 clones, mostly outgrowing at 2.4 mmol/L AMG
458, was further analyzed and only 57 (58%) contained a kinase
domain mutation. This is in contrast to the NVP-BVU972
screen where a kinase domain mutation could be detected in
every clone obtained (Supplementary Fig. S1). The fact that
AMG 458 is less potent and selective than NVP-BVU972 might
reduce the selective pressure to acquire resistance through
MET alterations, but alternative resistance mechanisms were
not investigated in this study.
Within the subset of clones that contained kinase domain
mutations, a total of 15 different mutations on the DNA level
were observed, resulting in 13 amino acid changes in 10 different residues (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S2). Three
of these mutations (V1155L, F1200I, and D1228A) had been

found in the NVP-BVU972 screen as well, whereas Y1230
mutations were not detected in the presence of AMG 458.
The most frequently altered residue in the AMG 458 resistance
screen, accounting for 60% of all kinase domain mutations,
was F1200 (Fig. 3A). The chemical structure of AMG 458
suggests that it belongs to the so-called "type II" class of
kinase inhibitors that bind to the "DFG out" type of kinase
conformation. This is why, in the absence of an available
cocrystal structure of AMG 458 and MET, we modeled the
binding mode of the inhibitor (Fig. 3B) using the reported
crystal structure of MET in complex with a type II pyrrolopyridine-pyridone inhibitor of similar chemical structure (25).
This model provides a plausible and simple explanation to the
appearance of mutations at residues Y1159, G1163, M1211,
V1155, L1195, and F1200 in the resistance screen. All these
residues form direct interactions with AMG 458 in the model,
the first 3 with the quinoline ring and the last 3 with the
dihydropyrazolone moiety. The other more distant mutations
may influence the conformation of the kinase and render it
unfavorable for type II inhibitors to bind.
NGS can detect low-frequency variants in pools of
resistant BaF3 cells
Next, we tested whether NGS could be used to determine
mutation profiles in resistant BaF3 cell pools. To this end, such
pools were generated by repeating resistance screens with
either NVP-BVU972 or AMG 458 in a slightly different format.
As before, the MET kinase domain was PCR amplified and the
single amplicon originating from each pool subjected to NGS
(Supplementary Materials and Methods). A high level of
sequence coverage was achieved across the 818 bps with a
dip in coverage on the ends due to incomplete shearing of the
PCR amplicon (Supplementary Fig. S2). Low frequency variants could be detected, and the NGS-derived variants identified in the pooled screens correlated well with those identified
previously by single-clone sequencing (Supplementary
Table S3). However, several mutations were not identified
in the pooled products, notably D1228 mutations in the NVPBVU972–treated BaF3 cells. This is probably not due to the
sensitivity of the NGS platform but could be a consequence of
the different selection process (Supplementary Materials and
Methods). There was also a strand-specific artifact that manifested in a markedly higher variant frequency in one strand
versus the complementary strand. This artifact was largely
removed by the analysis pipeline described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Extent of cellular resistance correlates with frequency
of mutations in resistance screens
To functionally validate the resistance mutations, we first
compared the ability of NVP-BVU972 and AMG 458 to inhibit
proliferation of BaF3 cells containing wild-type or selected
mutant versions of TPR-MET by making use of the clones
obtained in the 2 resistance screens. In these experiments, we
included 2 additional previously described MET inhibitors to
cover a more diverse set of chemical structures. The dual
MET/ALK inhibitor PF-02341066 is not chemically related to
NVP-BVU972 but binds to a similar conformation of MET, also

making a direct contact with Y1230 (26). XL880 has been
shown to bind to a DFG out conformation of MET that is
significantly different from the one observed with NVPBVU972 (27). This type II MET inhibitor bears chemical
similarity to AMG 458, suggesting a comparable binding
mode.
In line with their high frequency in the NVP-BVU972 screen,
Y1230 and D1228 mutations caused dramatic shifts in the
measured IC50 values for NVP-BVU972 in cellular proliferation
assays (Fig. 4A and Table 2). In agreement with previous data
(26), PF-02341066 was also substantially affected by alterations in these 2 residues, whereas no or only mild IC50 shifts
were observed with AMG 458 and XL880 (Table 2). F1200I had
a clear impact on potency of all tested compounds (Fig. 4A
and Table 2), which is expected due to the high frequency of
F1200 mutations in the AMG 458 screen and its appearance
in the NVP-BVU972 screen. A comparable profile was seen
with L1195V, whereas resistance elicited by V1155L was more
restricted to NVP-BVU972 and PF-02341066 (Fig. 4A and
Table 2).

To rule out the impact of additional undetected mutations
in the clones obtained from random mutagenesis screens,
selected mutations were produced by site-directed mutagenesis in TPR-MET expression constructs that were then introduced into parental BaF3 cells. Proliferation assays in the
resulting strains confirmed the shifts in compound potency
that had been measured in the random mutagenesis clones
before (Supplementary Table S4). Furthermore, biochemical
assays were conducted with recombinant MET proteins,
either unmutated or containing Y1230H or F1200I mutations.
Data in this assay format were largely in agreement with the
cellular resistance pattern (Table 2).
Resistance correlates with maintenance of tyrosine
phosphorylation in the presence of MET inhibitors
Active recombinant MET protein and TPR-MET fusion
protein expressed in BaF3 cells display a high level of tyrosine
phosphorylation in the activation loop (14). We compared by
Western blot analysis the levels of Y1234/Y1235 phosphorylation in recombinant proteins that were used for kinase assays

NOTE: Top section: Antiproliferative activity of 4 structurally distinct MET inhibitors in BaF3 cells containing wild-type (WT) TPR-MET
or the indicated mutant TPR-MET versions. Resistant clones from random mutagenesis screens were used. IC50 values for all mutants
are expressed as fold shift in comparison to WT (n ¼ 3). Comparable results were obtained with NVP-BVU972 and PF-02341066 in all
other clones with Y1230 or D1228 mutations that occurred in the NVP-BVU972 resistance screen (data not shown). Bottom section:

as well as in TPR-MET of representative resistance clones
covering the most frequent mutations from both screens.
Both Y1230H and F1200I were associated with enhanced
phosphorylation in purified recombinant proteins (Fig. 4B).
Very modest mutation-dependent differences in TPR-MET
phosphorylation were also observed in protein lysates from
BaF3 cells (Fig. 4C).
Next, we examined the impact of NVP-BVU972 and AMG
458 on TPR-MET phosphorylation in BaF3 TPR-MET wildtype cells and selected mutants. We observed a dose-dependent reduction in TPR-MET phosphorylation when applying
either NVP-BVU972 (Fig. 4D, top) or AMG 458 (Fig. 4D,
bottom) to cells expressing wild-type TPR-MET. Both
Y1230H and D1228A mutations abrogated the effect of
NVP-BVU972 but not AMG 458, whereas F1200I and
L1195V interfered with the potency of both compounds to
inhibit TPR-MET phosphorylation (Fig. 4D). Unexpectedly,
this effect was more pronounced in the case of NVPBVU972, even though the opposite trend had been observed
with a proliferation readout. Nevertheless, mutation-mediated
effects on phosphorylation and proliferation are generally well
correlated and in line with the acquired resistance.

Discussion
In an attempt to prospectively identify resistance mutations
affecting the novel MET inhibitor NVP-BVU972, we carried out
a cellular drug resistance screen in TPR-MET–transformed
BaF3 cells and detected a large proportion of Y1230 mutations.

www.aacrjournals.org

Cocrystallization of NVP-BVU972 with the MET kinase
domain provided a clear explanation for this resistance hot
spot by revealing a p-stacking interaction of the central
imidazo-pyridazine ring system of NVP-BVU972 and the activation loop residue Y1230. Therefore, resistance caused by
alterations of this residue is likely due to direct disruption of
an interaction that is crucial for drug binding. This hypothesis
is also supported by data obtained with similar MET inhibitors
(see below). Interestingly, we observed with more potent
derivatives from the NVP-BVU972 series that the potency
shift caused by Y1230H or Y1230F was less pronounced than
with Y1230C, suggesting that aromatic side chains as in
histidine or phenylalanine can still weakly support an interaction with the central ring system of the compounds (data
not shown).
Pronounced resistance was also observed with alterations
of the residue D1228, whereas mutations in V1155 and F1200
were infrequent and had milder effects. On the basis of the
cocrystal structure, these residues are engaged in interactions
that hold Y1230 in place to support the conformation needed
for NVP-BVU972 binding. In contrast, a screen with the
structurally unrelated MET inhibitor AMG 458 revealed a
mutation profile that was clearly distinct and enriched in
F1200 mutations. Even though 3 mutations were shared
between both resistance profiles, the frequency of these
mutations in the respective screens differed significantly. A
model of AMG 458 bound to MET suggested a structural
rationale for most resistance mutations. The extent of resistance was quantified using cellular and biochemical kinase

assays; however, the interpretation of these data was complicated by the finding that the basal phosphorylation levels of
TPR-MET in BaF3 cells and of recombinant MET protein
depended to some extent on the respective mutation. In
biochemical assays, the Km value for ATP was found to be
about 6 times and about 4 times lower for F1200I and Y1230H
compared with wild-type MET. To account for these differences, ATP concentrations in the assay were adjusted accordingly. Even though it is conceivable that differential affinity for
ATP and basal phosphorylation levels contribute to the
observed shift in IC50, we believe that this factor is minor
in light of the very pronounced IC50 shifts caused by some of
the mutations because of the plausible structural explanations
for resistance effects.
Activating mutations in the MET kinase domain have been
originally reported in patients with hereditary and sporadic
papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) and later in several
other cancer types (28). Some of these activating mutations
are identical to resistance mutations that were discovered in
our screens. D1228N, Y1230C, Y1230H, and Y1230D have all
been found in hereditary or sporadic PRCC (28, 29), and
Y1230C has also been reported in metastases of head and
neck cancer (30, 31). In a recently published crystal structure
of the autoinhibited, completely dephosphorylated kinase
domain of MET, both D1228 and Y1230 were found to be
involved in interactions that stabilize the inactive conformation, providing an explanation why mutations of these residues are selected for to enhance kinase activity (32). Because
of their activating nature, some of the NVP-BVU972 resistance
mutations might thus confer a selective advantage even in the
absence of inhibitor treatment.
Several highly selective MET inhibitors including JNJ38877605 (Johnson & Johnson; phase I), PF-04217903 (Pfizer;
phase I), SGX523 (SGX Pharmaceuticals; phase I discontinued), and probably AMG 208 (Amgen; phase I) are structurally similar to NVP-BVU972 (26, 33–36). Cocrystal
structures of MET and the respective inhibitor have been
published for PF-04217903, SGX523, and 2 Amgen triazolopyridazines. In all cases, a critical p-stacking interaction
with Y1230 was observed. The chemically unrelated dual
MET/Alk inhibitor PF-02341066 was also found to bind to a
similar MET conformation (26, 33, 34, 37). Because of these
concurrent binding modes, the NVP-BVU972 resistance
mutation profile might be predictive for many other selective MET inhibitors. Prompted by the literature reports on
MET mutations in cancer patients, several MET inhibitors
have already been tested against various subsets of these
mutations. The Y1230-interacting compounds PF-02341066
and PF-04217903 were both tested in a panel of MET
mutations in biochemical as well as cellular assays (26).
Y1230C and D1228H were found to profoundly impair the
activity of both compounds, and substantial resistance was
also seen with Y1235D. Conversely, the related compounds
AM7 and AMG 458 retained activity against several mutations including Y1230H and D1228H (16, 38). Our resistance
screens confirmed these prior findings.
Neither Y1235 nor L1195 mutations were observed in our
initial NVP-BVU972 screen despite their potential to cause

5262

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

resistance against NVP-BVU972 and related molecules
(Table 2 and ref. 26). NGS of a NVP-BVU972–resistant pool
revealed a L1195I mutation, but D1228 variants were absent
from this pool (Supplementary Materials and Methods).
Similar to NVP-BVU972, mutation profiles obtained with
AMG 458 were not entirely overlapping when comparing
single clones and NGS. Furthermore, all missense mutations
of Y1230 that can be obtained with a single bp change were
found in the NVP-BVU972 screen with the exception of
Y1230F. However, when introducing Y1230F into BaF3
TPR-MET, we observed strong resistance (data not shown).
Together these observations indicate that our random mutagenesis screens were not fully comprehensive and a substantial scale-up in the screening format might be needed to
reliably cover rare mutations.
High-level amplification of the MET gene has been linked to
MET-dependent growth in gastric and lung cancer cell lines
(23, 24). In this context, it is important to determine whether
resistance mutations in only a fraction of MET copies are
sufficient to drive resistance. The T790M mutation in EGFR is
frequently found in patients with acquired resistance to the
EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. In one report, where
the gefitinib-sensitive and EGFR-amplified cell line H3255 was
exposed to gefitinib for a prolonged period, a resistant subclone was obtained that contained T790M in only a small
fraction of the amplified alleles (39).
Although the activated TPR-MET fusion used in our cellular
screening model may influence protein folding compared with
full-length MET, our choice of this construct was motivated by
the fact that it readily renders BaF3 cells IL3-independent, that
substantial MET inhibitor drug discovery has been carried out
across the industry using this fusion protein, and, most
importantly, that the structural activity relationship across
multiple chemotypes has been found to track between TPRMET and cell lines expressing native full-length MET. Thus, we
can assume that the entire MET kinase domain fused to TPR
likely recapitulates the structure of the same domain in the
context of full-length MET. We attempted to express fulllength MET containing resistance mutations in several cellular systems but failed to obtain sufficient protein expression
for functional evaluation. However, while this article was
under revision, Qi and colleagues reported MET-Y1230
mutations in resistant derivatives of a gastric cancer cell line
expressing full-length MET, which were obtained under
treatment with MET inhibitors that rely on p-stacking with
Y1230, similar to NVP-BVU972 (40). Hence, confirming that
the same predominant mutation arises to confer resistance to
p-stacking inhibitors in the context of full-length or TPR-fused
MET.
Alternative resistance mechanisms involving the compensatory activation of EGFR or KRAS amplification have also
been observed in MET-dependent cells (41–44). Importantly,
EGFR-dependent cell lines could be rescued from EGFR
inhibition by MET activation, indicating that this mechanism
can operate reciprocally (45–47).
To our knowledge, there are no reports of acquired
resistance mutations in MET from clinical trials yet.
However, the results of our random mutagenesis screens

underline the need to carefully monitor the preexistence or
emergence of MET mutations in clinical trials with MET
inhibitors. This will not only be crucial to fully understand
the observed response patterns but may also guide the
choice of the suitable inhibitors, either used sequentially
or even concomitantly, in case compounds with different
binding modes become clinically available. Furthermore,
our resistance mutation profiling setup could be used
preclinically to differentiate novel drug candidates from
already existing clinical candidates.
