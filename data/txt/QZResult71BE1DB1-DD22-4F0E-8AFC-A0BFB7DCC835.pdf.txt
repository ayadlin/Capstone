ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate the possible crosstalk between C-X-C chemokine receptor
4 (CXCR4)/C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12)/C-X-C chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7)
axis with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in neuroendocrine
tumors (NETs).
Methods: Sixty-one human NETs were included into the study. CXCR4/CXCL12/
CXCR7 axis and mTOR pathway were assessed by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry
(IHC). The effect of mTOR inhibitor, RAD001, was evaluated on CXCR4 pathway
through proliferation and p-Erk and p-AKT induction. Results: CXCR4/CXCL12/
CXCR7 axis and p-mTOR were found to be active and correlated with grading, Ki67
index and tumor stage. mTOR pathway activation significantly correlated with poor
prognosis. In human NET cells, CXCL12 induced mTOR signalling while AMD3100
(CXCR4-antagonist) impaired it. The mTOR-antagonist, RAD001, impaired the CXCL12dependent induction of CXCR4 downstream effectors. Combination of AMD3100 and
RAD001 potentiate cell growth inhibition.
Conclusions: CXCR4/CXCL12/CXCR7 axis is active in NETs and signals on mTOR.
CXCR4 might be considered a prognostic factor in NETs. Combined treatment with
AMD3100 and RAD001 may provide clinical benefits in NET patients with drugresistant.

INTRODUCTION

potent anti-proliferative effect of RAD001, mediated by
the cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, but not apoptosis,
was recently shown in MTC cells [18]. To date, mTOR
inhibitors failed to provide relevant benefits and patients
often develop resistance to therapy and progression of
disease [22]. Thus there are still unmet need for new
therapeutic targets [23-25].
The chemokine CXCL12 binds the two receptors
CXCR4 and CXCR7 and transduces on the mTOR
pathway in pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, T cell
leukemia cell and in human renal cancer cells [2628]. Chemokines are a superfamily of chemoattractant
proteins that induce cytoskeletal rearrangement, firm
adhesion to specific cells and directional migration [29].
The binding of chemokines to their receptors triggers
a cascade of events, including receptor dimerization,
recruitment of heterotrimeric G proteins, and activation
of the Janus kinase and Signal Transducer and Activator
of Transcription (STAT), PI3K and mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated
kinases (ERK) pathways. Emerging evidence indicates
that chemokine receptors pathways control tumor
development, including tumor growth, progression, and
metastasis [30, 31] and that CXCL12/CXCR4 activation
induces migration and metastatic processes [32-34].
The aim of the study was to evaluate the CXCR4/
CXCL12/CXCR7 axis and the possible crosstalk with
mTOR pathway in NETs to identify new prognostic and
therapeutic targets.

Neuroendocrine tumors are relatively rare (incidence
about 1-5 cases/100,000/year) and heterogeneous
neoplasms with increasing incidence and prevalence [1].
NETs display variegate biological and clinical course in
which primary site, stage and grading affect prognosis.
According to the last classification of the World Health
Organization (WHO) 2010, gastroenteropancreatic NETs
(GEP-NETs) are classified into low (G1) intermediate
(G2) and high-grade (G3) lesions, based on mitotic count
and Ki67 score [2, 3]. High grade lesions (neuroendocrine
carcinomas, NEC) present a mitotic count of >20 for 10
high-powered fields (HPF) or a Ki67 proliferation index
of >20% [4], and are generally treated with platinumbased chemotherapy regimens. On the contrary, welldifferentiated, low- and intermediate-grade NETs (G1,
G2) are clinically indolent with a low proliferation
index and good prognosis. Approximately 50% of NETs
present with metastases at the diagnosis; the conventional
treatment is based on biological therapies (somatostatin
analogues, α2b-interferon) or chemotherapy. Nevertheless
no significant impact on survival has been obtained [5].
Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a malignant
tumor of the thyroid (5 to 10% of all thyroid malignancies)
originating in C-cell, deriving from the neural crest,
expressing neuroendocrine markers (chromogranine
and synaptofisin). Stage in thyroid cancer is based on
TNM Classification and separate stage groupings are
recommended for different histotypes [6, 7]. MTC is a
well differentiated NET, slowly growing and insensitive
to chemotherapy. Somatostatin analogues and interferon
only ameliorates symptoms, while the newly identified
TK-inhibitors vandetanib and cabozantinib have
antiproliferative effect [8-11].
As of today mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitors, such as RAD001, have been approved
as second-line therapy in patients with progressive
pancreactic NETs [12-14]. mTOR is a serine-threonine
kinase regulating different cellular processes, such as
metabolism, nutrient sensing, translation and cell growth
[15]. Both mTOR molecular complexes, mTORC1 and
mTORC2, use mTOR as the catalytic subunit. mTORC1
increases cell growth and proliferation through ribosomal
protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein (4EBP1)
[16, 17]. mTORC2 phosphorylates Protein kinase B
(Akt), at Thr450 and Ser473 [18, 19]. Evidence suggest
that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/
mTOR signaling is involved in NET tumorigenesis and
progression, given its critical role in cell proliferation and
angiogenesis. Tamburrino et al. showed that the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathway is crucial to MTC tumorigenesis [20]
and in a recent review, Manfredi et al. showed that MTC
cell proliferation depends on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling,
suggesting a novel therapeutic target for MTC [21]. A

RESULTS
CXCR4/CXCL12/CXCR7 pathway is
overexpressed in GEP-NETs and MTCs
Clinical and pathological characteristics of the study
population are summarized in Table 1. CXCR4, CXCL12
and CXCR7 mRNA expression was evaluated in 61 NETs
and in 36 normal tissues, as shown in Figure 1. CXCR4,
CXCL12 and CXCR7 were significantly overexpressed in
NETs as compared to normal samples (p<0.0001).
CXCR4, CXCL12 and CXCR7 protein levels were
evaluated by IHC in 53/61 patients (31 GEP-NETs, 18
MTCs and 4 unknown). A positive immunostaining was
found in 28/31 (90%) GEP-NETs and 13/18 (72%) MTCs
for CXCR4, in 29/31 (93%) GEP-NETs and 17/18 (94%)
MTCs for CXCR7 and in 30/31 (97%) GEP-NETs and
16/18 (89%) MTCs for CXCL12 (Table 2) (Figure 2).
A significant correlation was identified among
CXCR4, CXCR7 and CXCL12 (Table 3). In GEP-NETs,
a significant positive correlation was observed between
the CXCR4/CXCL12/CXCR7 immunostaining score
and Ki67 score (p<0.05). CXCR4 and CXCR7 were
more expressed in G3 than in G1/G2 (p<0.05). In MTCs,
CXCR7 and CXCL12 immunostaining was significantly
higher in stage II-III as compared to stage I (p<0.05).

Neither in GEP-NETs nor in MTCs, CXCR4/CXCL12/
CXCR7 level correlated with clinical outcome.
The mTOR pathway was evaluated; 18 of 31 GEPNETs (58%) were positive for both mTOR and p-mTOR,
10 (56%) and 14 (78%) of 18 MTCs were positive for
mTOR and p-mTOR respectively. Moreover, 19/31
(61%) GEP-NETs and 12/18 (67%) MTCs were positive
for p-S6K1, 16/31 (52%) GEP-NETs and 9/18 (50%)

MTCs for p-4EBP1 (Table 2). As expected, a significant
positive correlation was observed between mTOR and
p-mTOR (p<0.05), mTOR and both p-S6K1 and p-4EBP1
(p<0.05 and p<0.0001) and between p-mTOR and its
two effectors (p<0.05) (Table 3). The immunostaining
score for p-mTOR (p<0.05) was significantly higher in
G1/G2 tumors than in G3 in GEP-NETs, while it was
not significantly correlated to tumor stage in MTCs.

In the whole NET population, p-mTOR (p<0.01) and
p-4EBP1 (p<0.01) scores were significantly high in
patients with unfavorable outcome. In particular in GEPNETs, p-mTOR (p<0.05), p-S6K1(p<0.05) and p-4EBP1
(p<0.05) scores were high in patients with unfavorable
outcome. In MTCs, there was no significant correlation
between mTOR pathway immunostaining and outcome.
Finally, CXCR4 significantly correlated with
mTOR (p<0.01) and p-S6K1( p<0.05) while CXCR7 with
p-S6K1(p<0.05) (Table 3).

(pancreatic-NET) were tested for CXCL12 induced
signaling. As shown in Figure 3, in BON and NCI-H727,
CXCR4 and CXCR7 were overexpressed. CXCL12
induced the mTOR targets p-S6K1 and p-4EBP1 in BON
cells and the CXCL12-induction was inhibited by the
specific CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 (Figure 4). As
expected, addition of mTOR inhibitor, RAD001, blocked
the downstream mTOR effectors (Figure 4A); RAD001
modestly impaired CXCL12-mediated p-Erk1/2, p-P38
and p-Akt induction. Moreover CXCL12 induced the
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and P38, which was inhibited
by AMD3100 (Figure 4B).
Then, the effects of CXCL12 were evaluated on the
BON and NCI-H727 cells growth. AMD3100 and RAD001
reduced cell growth already at 24 hrs (Figure 5). Moreover,

DISCUSSION

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To shed further insight on NET biology the role
of the CXCR4/CXCL12/CXCR7 axis and the possible
interconnection with the signaling on mTOR pathway was
investigated. It was observed that CXCR4, CXCL12 and
CXCR7 increased in both GEP-NETs and MTCs. Recent
evidence demonstrated that CXCR4 is expressed in lung
NETs [35] and significantly correlated with negative
patient outcome [36]. To the best of our knowledge this
is the first time that the whole CXCR4/CXCL12/CXCR7
axis was found overexpressed in NETs and correlating
with tumor grading and Ki67 [37]. In MTCs, high CXCR7
and CXCL12 expression was detected in more advanced
tumors and high p-mTOR level was observed in G1/G2
GEP-NETs compared to G3. The correlation between
tumor grading and activation of p-mTOR in NETs is
controversial [38, 39] probably because NETs are rare
tumors but also because the poor differentiated NETs
are underrepresented in the most of studies. Furthermore
these data confirmed that the mTOR pathway is broadly
expressed in NETs and seems prognostic factors [40].
Crosstalks between CXCR4, CXCL12 and PI3K/mTOR
had been previously described in peritoneal disseminated
gastric cancer [26], pancreatic cancer [41], human T-cel
leukemia [42] and renal cancer [28]. The existence
of an interplay between CXCR4, CXCL12 and PI3K/
mTOR has been demonstrated in NETs, where CXCL12
induced p-S6K1 and p-4EBP1 in NET cell lines and
the CXCL12-induction was inhibited by AMD3100.
The addition of RAD001 blocked and further reduced
the mTOR downstream effectors. In addition, at the
immunohistochemical analysis, CXCR4 correlated
with mTOR and p-S6K1 and CXCR7 with p-S6K1. As
RAD001 impaired CXCL12-mediated p-Erk1/2 and p-P38
induction, the conclusion was that mTOR inhibition is
downstream of CXCR4 axis.
CXCL12 dependent CXCR4 signals on mTOR
inducing human NET cell growth while the inhibitors
AMD3100 and RAD001 impaired cell growth with an
additive effect. We recently developed a new class of
cyclic peptidic CXCR4 antagonists [43], that could be
evaluated in combination with RAD001in NET patients.
The goal of this study will be to provide a dose and
regimen for the combined treatment and its tolerability,
as reported by other ongoing clinical trials exploiting the
interaction of mTOR with other pathways [44].
In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report of CXCR4 expression and signaling in
NETs through the mTOR pathway. CXCR4 may represent
a new prognostic factor in NET tumors and mTOR
inhibitors coupled with the CXCR4 inhibitors could

Patients and specimens

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Sixty-one patients diagnosed with NETs and
followed in two Units of the Multidisciplinary NET group
of Naples (the “Federico II” University Hospital and the
Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori,
Fondazione “ G. Pascale” of Naples) were enrolled. Out
of 61 patients, 53 tumor samples were available as paraffin
embedded tissue (31 GEP-NETs, 4 unknown primary
origin and 18 MTCs) and 8 as fresh tissue (5 GEP-NETs
and 3 MTCs). GEP-NETs were classified according
to the WHO International Histological Classification
of Endocrine Tumors 2010 [37, 45] while MTCs were
classified following the latest staging system (TNM) valid
for thyroid tumors [7]. Normal tissue samples (7 thyroid,
29 gastrointestinal) were available for comparative studies.
Expression analysis by quantitative real-time PCR
was performed on tumor samples of the whole NET
population (53 paraffin embedded and 8 fresh tissues) and
36 normal tissue samples (28 paraffin embedded and 8
fresh tissues) while immunohistochemistry was performed
on 53 tumors. Clinical course of disease after surgery
was classified as favourable (no evidence of disease, no.
23) and unfavourable (disease persistence no. 11, death
for tumor progression no. 10). Follow-up data were not
available in 17 patients.
The study was approved by the institutional review
board of the Institutions involved in the study (protocol
n°102/2013 approved by the Federico II University Ethical
Committee). Informed consent was obtained from patients
for their tissues to be used in research.
The data were analyzed anonymously and all
clinical investigation have been conducted according to
the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using
the primary monoclonal antibodies: CXCR4, CXCR7 and
CXCL12 were from R&D Systems; mTOR, p-mTOR
(Ser2448) and p-S6K1 (Thr389) were from Cell Signaling
Technology; p-4EBP1 (Thr70) was from Abcam. The
specificity of all reactions was validated in parallel with
negative controls obtained omitting primary antibodies.
Immunohistochemical findings were independently
evaluated by four pathologists (EG, MDBDC, SL, FT).
Cases with conflicting scores were reviewed jointly with
a multi-head microscope until a consensus was reached.
All cases were evaluated using a semi-quantitative
scoring (IRS) system [46]. Staining intensity was scored
as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong)
18871

Oncotarget

(Figure  1). The percentage of tumor cells stained were
scored as 0 (none), 1 (1–10%), 2 (11–50%), 3 (51–80%),
4 (> 80%). The intensity and percentage were multiplied,
resulting in an individual immunoreactivity score (IRS)
ranging from 0 to 12. The raw expression scores were
used for correlation analysis. For correlation with clinic
pathological variables, any expression of CXCR4,
CXCR7, CXCL12, mTOR, p-mTOR, p-S6K1 and
p-4EBP1 (IRS 1–12) was considered positive.
Ki67 score was evaluated in GEP-NETs tumor
samples by counting >2000 cells in immunohistochemical
samples representative of the tumour, and a percentage
of immunoreactivity (Labeling Index) was calculated
[47]. The mitotic count was evaluated according to the
method recommended in the 7th edition of the AJCC
Cancer Staging Manual: enumerate mitoses in the most
mitotically active area (“hot spot”) and then extend mitotic
count to adjacent contiguous fields. If no mitotic activity
was evident, random representative tumor fields were
scanned for mitoses.

The gene specific primers used for amplification
were as follows:
CXCR4: Fw 5’-TGGGTGGTTGTGTTCCAGTTT-3’
Rw 5’-ATGCAATACCAGGACAGGATGA-3’,
CXCR7: Fw 5’-GATTGCCCGCCTCAGAAC-3’
Rw 5’-GCAGGACGCTTTTGTTGG-3’,
CXCL12: Fw 5’-TGTGGCACTCAGATACCGACT-3’
Rw 5’-CCCACAGAGCCAATCACT-3’.
A498 and MCF7 cell lines were used as CXCR4 and
CXCR7 positive control, respectively; FB1 and SF295
as CXCR4 and CXCR7 negative control, respectively.
Samples were run in triplicate, and their relative
expression was calculated in the following formula using
β-actin as endogenous control: 2-ΔΔCt.

Western blot
BON cell line was allowed to grow in T75 flasks
until 70% confluence. The CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100,
was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and
RAD001 from Novartis. Complete media was replaced
with CXCL12 (100 ng/ml) for 10 min and after with
AMD3100 (5 μM), with or without the RAD001 (1μM).
After treatment, total protein was extracted from cells,
after homogenization in lysis buffer (10 mM NaF, 10
mM Na-pyrophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4. Invitrogen)
containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (SigmaAldrich). Then the supernatants were obtained using
centrifugation at 4 °C, 14 000 r.p.m. for 15 min. Total
proteins (50 μg) were separated using Sodium Dodecyl
Sulphate - PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) at 10%. Proteins on gels were transferred to
Nitrocellulose Blotting Membranes 0.45 μm (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences) for 1.5 hours at 220 mA in a
transfer chamber. Membranes were blocked with 5%
milk in TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl,
0.05% Tween-20) for 1 hour at room temperature and then
incubated overnight in primary antibodies at 4 °C. Rabbit
monoclonal antibodies for Erk1/2, p-Erk1/2 (Thr202/
Tyr204), S6K1, p-S6K1(Thr389), 4EBP1, p-4EBP1,
p-P38 (Thr180/Tyr182), P38, p-Akt (Ser473), Akt were
from Cell Signaling Technology. The non-phosphorylated
form of each protein was used as internal control.
Membranes were washed three times with TBST for 10
minutes and incubated with secondary antibody for 2
hours at room temperature. Secondary antibodies include
goat anti-rabbit-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After
3 TBST washes of 10 minutes each, membranes were
revealed through EMD Millipore Immobilon™ Western
Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (ECL).

Cell culture
Human NET cell lines used in this study include a
Bronchial-NET cell line (NCI-H727) and a pancreaticNET cell line (BON). NCI-H727 cell line was obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and BON
cell line was gifted by Professor Papotti (University of
Turin at San Luigi Hospital, Orbassano).
NCI-H727 was maintained in Rosswell Park
Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 and BON was cultured
in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium:Nutrient Mixture
F-12 (DMEM/F12) both supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 2 nM L-glutamine, penicillin 10, 000
IU/mL and streptomycin 10, 000 μg/mL (all from Sigma–
Aldrich) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2
at 37°C. Human renal cancer cells (A498), human breast
adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) and human glioblastoma
cells (SF295) were obtained from the NCI-Drug Screen
Program and human anaplastic thyroid cancer cells (FB1) were obtained from the courtesy of Prof. Rosamarina
Melillo, Federico II University, Naples-Italy.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was isolated from NETs fresh tissue or
paraffin-embedded tissues using the RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and RNeasy FFPE Kit
according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was
synthesized for cDNA using SuperScript III Reverse
Transciptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was
performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). β-actin gene was used as an
endogenous control for sample normalization. Data were
collected and quantitatively analyzed on an ABI Prism
7000 System (Applied Biosystems).

Proliferation assay
BON and NCI-H727 cells were plated into 6-well
plates at a density of 50 x 104 cells/well in duplicate. After
24 hrs, RAD001 (1μM), AMD3100 (5μM) or both agents

Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad 5
software (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and the
results were considered statistically significant at a level
of p<0.05. The t Tests, nonparametric Mann-Whitney test,
one-tailed was used to analyze relative mRNA expression
level of CXCR4/CXCL12/CXCR7 axis in tumors
versus non-tumor tissues and it was used to compare
the distribution of the markers investigated among the
different tumor groups and with clinical and pathological
variables. The Spearman’s test was used to analyze the
correlation index among markers expression. One-way
ANOVA and multiple comparisons with Bonferroni
correction was used to evaluate the growth cells in vitro.
