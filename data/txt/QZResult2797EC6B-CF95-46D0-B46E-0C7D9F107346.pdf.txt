origin migrate to tumors derived from humans, rats, or mice (1, 3, 4).
Further, stem/progenitor cells of human or murine origin migrate to
multiple tumor types, including melanoma, glioblastoma, prostate
and breast carcinoma, and neuroblastoma in immunocompromised
mouse models (1–6). Our laboratories have been investigating the
possibility that the tumor tropism of stem or progenitor cells might
be exploited to deliver therapeutic cDNAs selectively to tumors to
maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize toxic side effects.
Specifically, we have evaluated the potential use of HB1.F3.C1
cells, a v-MYC-immortalized clonal cell line derived from human
fetal telencephalon cells, as delivery vehicles for therapeutic
cDNAs, such as IFN-h (7), cytosine deaminase (1, 3), or carboxylesterase (2). One of the major goals of the current study is to
determine whether these cells or cells with similar properties might
be used to effectively treat metastatic solid tumors.
We recently documented the preferential migration of HB1.F3.C1
cells to disseminated SK-N-AS, NB-1643, and NB-1691 neuroblastoma tumors in a preclinical model. We also reported efficacy
following treatment with HB1.F3.C1 cells expressing IFN-h and an
interim analysis (6-month survival) following treatment with
HB1.F3.C1 cells expressing a secreted form of a rabbit carboxylesterase (rCE) in combination with CPT-11 (2, 7–10). We now
report the long-term efficacy for the latter approach and also
document that plasma carboxylesterase activities are unchanged
and SN-38 levels are within levels tolerated by pediatric patients
(11–13) at doses of CPT-11 that produced 1-year disease-free
survival of 90% of mice.

Abstract
Neural stem cells and progenitor cells migrate selectively to
tumor loci in vivo. We exploited the tumor-tropic properties of
HB1.F3.C1 cells, an immortalized cell line derived from human
fetal telencephalon, to deliver the cDNA encoding a secreted
form of rabbit carboxylesterase (rCE) to disseminated
neuroblastoma tumors in mice. This enzyme activates the
prodrug CPT-11 more efficiently than do human enzymes.
Mice bearing multiple tumors were treated with rCE-expressing HB1.F3.C1 cells and schedules of administration of CPT-11
that produced levels of active drug (SN-38) tolerated by
patients. Both HB1.F3.C1 cells and CPT-11 were given i.v. None
of the untreated mice and 30% of mice that received only CPT11 survived long term. In contrast, 90% of mice treated with
rCE-expressing HB1.F3.C1 cells and 15 mg/kg CPT-11 survived
for 1 year without detectable tumors. Plasma carboxylesterase
activity and SN-38 levels in mice receiving both rCE-expressing
HB1.F3.C1 cells (HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE) and CPT-11 were
comparable with those in mice receiving CPT-11 only. These
data support the hypothesis that the antitumor effect of the
described neural stem/progenitor cell–directed enzyme prodrug therapy (NDEPT) is mediated by production of high
concentrations of active drug selectively at tumor sites,
thereby maximizing the antitumor effect of CPT-11. NDEPT
approaches merit further investigation as effective, targeted
therapy for metastatic tumors. We propose that the described
approach may have greatest use for eradicating minimum
residual disease. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):22–5]

Introduction

Cell lines. The SK-N-AS human neuroblastoma cell line was obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD); the cell line has
a normal MYCN gene copy number but expresses readily detectable levels of
MYCN RNA. SK-N-AS cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS at
37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. The HB1.F3.C1 cell line is a
multipotent cell line generated by retroviral transduction of fetal human
telencephalon cells of gestation of 15 weeks. This cell line was established at
the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada)
with all necessary permission from the Anatomical Pathology Department
of Vancouver General Hospital and by the Clinical Research Screening
Committee Involving Human Subjects of the University of British Columbia
and has been extensively characterized (14, 15). HB1.F3.C1 cells have
characteristics both of NSCs and of NPCs. To express therapeutic
transgenes, HB1.F3.C1 cells were transduced with replication-deficient
adenovirus [multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20] by standard methods as
reported previously (16). The HB1.F3.C1 cell line was grown in DMEM with
10% FCS at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2.

Neural stem cells (NSC), neural progenitor cells (NPC), and
mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow or adipose tissue
migrate in vivo to sites of pathology, including tumors (1–6). The
tumor tropism of these types of cells seems to be independent of
immune response, as it is evident in syngeneic models as well as in
severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and nude mice. The
molecular mechanism responsible for the tumor tropism of stem
and progenitor cells is poorly understood, but it is unlikely that
species specificity plays a dominant role because cells of murine

HB1.F3.C1 cells transduced to express rCE activate CPT-11 in vitro.
HB1.F3.C1 cells were exposed to a MOI of 20 of AdCMVrCE or empty vector
AdCMV for 24 h. Forty-eight hours later, CPT-11 (5 Amol/L) was added to
each flask for 4 h. Medium from flasks containing cells transduced with
AdCMVrCE or AdCMV was first centrifuged to remove cell debris and
serially diluted, and then diluted medium was applied for 4 h to tissue
culture wells containing SK-N-AS cells. Conditioned media were then
replaced with drug- and enzyme-free media, clonogenic assays were done by
standard methods as reported previously, and results are expressed as
percentage of colonies observed in wells containing medium from
AdCMVrCE-transduced HB1.F3.C1 cells compared with AdCMV-transduced
HB1.F3.C1 cells at the indicated dilutions of neat medium.
Determination of carboxylesterase activity and activated CPT-11
(SN-38) in plasma. The assays used to quantitate the carboxylesterase
activities and SN-38 concentrations in plasma have been published in detail
elsewhere (17). Briefly, carboxylesterase activity in the plasma was
determined by spectrophotometric quantitation of the conversion of the
general esterase substrate o-nitrophenyl acetate (o-NPA) to o-nitrophenol
(o-NP). One unit represents the amount of enzyme required to convert
1 nmol of o-NPA to o-NP per minute. SN-38 was quantitated by standard
high-performance liquid chromatography methods.
Long-term (1 year) therapeutic efficacy of HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE/
CPT-11 neural stem/progenitor cell–directed enzyme prodrug therapy.
To assess the efficacy of rCE/CPT-11 neural stem/progenitor cell–directed
enzyme prodrug therapy (NDEPT), mice were injected i.v. with SK-N-AS
neuroblastoma cells to develop disseminated tumors as described
previously. In this model, tumors develop at multiple anatomic locations,
including the kidney, liver, lung, ovary, and bone marrow in 100% of animals
(18). HB1.F3.C1 cells transduced to express a secreted form of rCE were
given 2 weeks following injection of neuroblastoma cells. Methods and
treatment protocols have been published in detail previously (2). Briefly,
HB1.F3.C1 cells (2 million/200 AL PBS) were given by tail vein injection.
Three days later, daily  five injections of CPT-11 (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) were
given also by the i.v. route. This protocol was given 2 weeks in a row
followed by a 2-week rest period and a second 2-week course of treatment.
Plasma esterase–deficient SCID (Es1e /SCID) mice were used for these
studies because they have plasma esterase levels similar to those in human
plasma. Groups of mice (n = 10) received no treatment, CPT-11 only, or
HB1.F3.C1 cells transduced to express rCE plus CPT-11. Mice were housed
in American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–
accredited vivaria. All animal protocols were approved by either the City of
Hope or the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Discomfort or distress was assessed by animal care
personnel with no knowledge of the protocol design. All euthanized mice
were verified as tumor bearing by necropsy. The end point for the
therapeutic study was long-term survival.
Statistical analyses. GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA) was used to analyze all data. Cell survival results (mean cell
number F SE) were analyzed using a two-tailed t test. Survival data are
presented as Kaplan-Meier plots and were analyzed using a log-rank
(Mantel-Haenszel) method.

whether a ‘‘therapeutic level’’ of rCE can be expressed by HB1.F3.C1
cells and also whether the rCE expressed or SN-38 produced at
tumor sites would remain at these loci to minimize systemic
toxicity. To evaluate the first of these components, we transduced
HB1.F3.C1 cells with replication-deficient adenovirus to express
rCE (HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE) and quantitated expression of active,
secreted rCE by assessing the carboxylesterase activity in
conditioned medium by two types of assays. First, we determined
that conditioned medium harvested from transduced cells readily
converted the general carboxylesterase substrate o-NPA to o-NP
(Fig. 2A), with approximately 500 to 800 units/mL of enzyme
activity detected 3 to 10 days following adenovirus transduction.
Second, coculturing of SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells with undiluted
conditioned medium containing the secreted rCE and CPT-11
reduced colony number by >95% (Fig. 2B). Although it was
unknown whether this level of expression of the secreted enzyme
was sufficient to produce an antitumor response in vivo, the data
show clearly that HB1.F3.C1 cells transduced with AdCMVrCE
express levels of secreted rCE sufficient to sensitize tumor cells to
CPT-11.
However, even if these observed levels of rCE expressed by
transduced HB1.F3.C1 cells proved sufficient to enhance the
antitumor efficacy of CPT-11, tumor-selective cytotoxicity would
be achieved only if the rCE expressed and the SN-38 produced at
tumor foci did not enter systemic circulation. Therefore, we
quantitated carboxylesterase activity and SN-38 levels in the plasma
of tumor-bearing mice that had been treated with 2 million
HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE cells and 15 mg/kg CPT-11. Plasma samples
for carboxylesterase activity assays were obtained at time 0 before
injection of HB1.F3.C1 cells and then at 24-h intervals for 4 days
following i.v. injection of AdCMVrCE-transduced HB1.F3.C1 cells
(Fig. 2C ). Plasma samples (100 AL) were incubated with
25 Amol/L CPT-11 in vitro, and the SN-38 produced was quantitated.
Plasma carboxylesterase activity in mice receiving AdCMVrCEtransduced HB1.F3.C1 cells was the same as that in naive control

Results and Discussion
Schematic diagram of NDEPT. Figure 1 shows a schematic
representation of the NDEPT approach to treatment of disseminated neuroblastoma that was used in this study. Mice bearing
disseminated SK-N-AS neuroblastoma tumors were given by tail
vein injection HB1.F3.C1 cells transduced to express rCE. In theory,
HB1.F3.C1 cells expressing rCE would migrate to tumors and,
following i.v. injection of CPT-11, would produce high concentrations of SN-38 at tumor sites to affect long-term disease-free
survival.

Intuitively, NDEPT approaches might be best used to eradicate the
few viable tumor cells that remain following conventional therapy
to prevent relapse. Therefore, the specific goal of these studies was
to determine if long-term survival could be achieved without
evidence of disease when treating mice bearing microscopic tumor
burdens.
Mice were injected i.v. with 500,000 SK-N-AS neuroblastoma
cells. Two weeks later, when tumors were microscopic to mimic
minimum residual disease, 2 million HB1.F3.C1 cells transduced to
express rCE were given by tail vein injection. Four days thereafter,
when the HB1.F3.C1 cells express maximal levels of rCE, CPT-11
was given daily  five. This therapy was given for 2 weeks followed
by a 2-week rest period and a second 2-week course of treatment.
Two cohorts of mice were treated: one with 7.5 mg/kg CPT-11 and
one with 15 mg/kg CPT-11. This protocol design provided doseresponse data to gain insight into the dose of drug required to
produce complete cures in this model.
With 1-year survival as the end point, Kaplan-Meier plots
(Fig. 3A and B) show a clear dose-response relationship for mice
treated with 7.5 mg CPT-11 compared with 15 mg/kg CPT-11, both

mice. At 96 h following injection of HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE cells, the
same mice were injected i.v. with 15 mg/kg CPT-11. Plasma samples
were obtained 5 min following injection of CPT-11 because this is
the time corresponding to the peak plasma concentration of SN-38.
Data in Fig. 2D show that the peak level of SN-38 in systemic
circulation was similar in mice receiving transduced HB1.F3.C1 cells
and CPT-11 compared with mice receiving CPT-11 alone. These
results indicate that systemic SN-38 concentrations are not
increased following injection with transduced HB1.F3.C1 cells and
suggest that unexpected drug toxicity at this dose is likely to be
minimal. Importantly, the plasma concentrations of SN-38 that
we observed are tolerated clinically when CPT-11 is given i.v. on a
daily  five schedule of administration.
As mentioned above, we propose that the most useful
application of NDEPT approaches to therapy will be to eradicate
minimum residual disease. Neuroblastoma patients frequently
achieve apparent complete remissions with surgery and chemotherapy, residual tumor being undetectable. However, the majority
of high-risk patients relapse with tumor at multiple sites, and no
effective therapy is available for metastatic disease at relapse.

Figure 2. HB1.F3.C1 cells transduced with
AdCMVrCE express sufficiently high levels of a
secreted form of rCE to activate CPT-11 and
sensitize neuroblastoma cells to this drug
in vitro. A, transduced HB1.F3.C1 cells
express approximately 30- to 40-fold higher
levels of carboxylesterase (CE ) activity than
untransduced cells 3 to 10 days following
transduction. B, conditioned medium from
HB1.F3.C1 cells transduced with AdCMVrCE
and cocultured with CPT-11 reduces the
clonogenic survival of SK-N-AS cells by up
to 98% compared with medium from cells
transduced with AdCMV and coincubated with
CPT-11. Experiments were done using
standard methods as detailed in Materials and
Methods. The average number of colonies in
control wells was 378 F 71. X axis, 1, undiluted
conditioned medium. C, treatment of tumorbearing mice with rCE-expressing HB1.F3.C1
cells and CPT-11 did not increase circulating
levels of carboxylesterase activity. Tumorbearing mice received 2 million HB1.F3.C1
cells transduced with AdCMVrCE i.v. The
plasma level of carboxylesterase activity at
time 0 before injection of cells and for up to
96 h thereafter showed similar levels of plasma
carboxylesterase activity. D, tumor-bearing
mice that received only CPT-11 (15 mg/kg) or
HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE cells and the same
dose of CPT-11 had similar plasma levels of
SN-38 5 min following i.v. injection of CPT-11.

Targeted Therapy for Disseminated Solid Tumors

Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier plots of tumor-bearing mice treated with HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE and CPT-11. Mice (10 per group) were injected i.v. with 500,000 SK-N-AS
cells to produce disseminated neuroblastoma (NB ) tumors in 100% of mice. Two weeks later, mice were treated with rCE/CPT-11 NDEPT by the following treatment
protocol: week 1, 2 million HB1.F3.C1 cells transduced with a MOI of 20 of AdCMVrCE followed by CPT-11 daily  five i.v. at the indicated doses; week 2, repeat
of week 1; weeks 3 and 4, no treatment; and weeks 5 and 6, same as weeks 1 and 2. The doses of CPT-11 given were 7.5 mg/kg (A) or 15 mg/kg (B).

reasoned that approaches to increase the therapeutic index of
CPT-11 might increase its efficacy, and our data support this
conclusion. Importantly, in contrast to previous reports using
similar approaches (1, 3, 4, 6, 7), we achieved disease-free, longterm survivals in 90% of animals. In principle, the described
approach might be modified to design effective therapy for any
metastatic solid tumor for which therapeutic cDNAs can be
identified.

for mice treated with CPT-11 alone (10% survival versus 30%,
respectively) and with CPT-11 as a component of NDEPT (50%
versus 90%, respectively). All mice surviving 1 year showed no
evidence of tumor. The data show that rCE/CPT-11 NDEPT was
more effective than CPT-11 alone and that 90% survival was
achieved in mice receiving NDEPT with 15 mg/kg CPT-11.
Other published studies in which stem or progenitor cells were
used to deliver prodrug-activating enzymes to tumors differed from
the study reported here in several ways (1, 3). First, the tumor
model we used was one of a disseminated solid tumor as a model
of metastatic disease. Second, the HB1.F3.C1 cells were injected
intravascularly, instead of intratumorally, as would be essential if
this type of approach was developed to treat microscopic
metastatic disease. Third, carboxylesterase/CPT-11 was chosen as
the enzyme/prodrug combination rather than the previously
reported cytosine deaminase/5-fluorocytosine combination (1, 3)
specifically because CPT-11 has shown encouraging, although not
necessarily curative, activity in neuroblastoma patients. We
