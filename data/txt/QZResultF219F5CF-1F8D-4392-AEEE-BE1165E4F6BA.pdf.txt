BACKGROUND: Drug choice and delivered dose of treatment potentially influence outcome in patients treated for follicular lymphoma (FL). Historically, observational studies have evaluated drug choice. The National LymphoCare Study (NLCS) is a prospective,
observational study of patients with FL who were enrolled at academic and community practice sites in the United States between
2004 and 2007. In the current study, the authors report on measures of delivered dose and its impact on outcomes for the most
common first-line regimens. METHODS: All evaluable patients with FL who were treated with initial rituximab plus cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP); rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CVP); or rituximab plus a fludarabine-containing regimen (R-Flu) were included. Associations between baseline factors, choice of treatment, number of cycles received, completion of therapy, and patient outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 646 patients received RCHOP, 297 received R-CVP, and 222 received R-Flu. Characteristics were similar between the 3 groups with the following exceptions.
Patients receiving R-CHOP were more often found to have grade 3 FL and patients receiving R-CVP were older and had higher Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index scores. The majority of patients (80%) received  5 cycles of treatment. Toxicity, but
not disease progression, was commonly cited as the reason for the early discontinuation of treatment (51% vs 6%). Time to retreatment was shorter for patients receiving  4 cycles, regardless of the treatment regimen used. The number of cycles was associated
with overall survival, progression-free survival, and lymphoma-related mortality for patients receiving R-CVP. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with FL receiving chemoimmunotherapy in the NLCS completed  5 cycles of treatment. Strategies to improve dose
delivery appear unlikely to impact outcomes, except possibly in patients receiving R-CVP. Although early treatment discontinuation

INTRODUCTION
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common type of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma in North America and is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical presentation and outcome.1 To the best of our knowledge, there is no single accepted
standard of care for the first-line treatment of this disease.2 Observational studies have traditionally provided data regarding drug regimens. However, drug delivery factors, including total dose and intensity, also may influence outcomes.3 The
delivery of chemoimmunotherapy in standard clinical practice may be different from when treatment is administered as
part of a clinical trial, in which patients are highly selected and adherence to protocol is required. Factors such as age, stage
of disease, and prognostic scores impact treatment choices and delivery in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL),4,5 but to the best of our knowledge little is known about the impact of these factors on the delivery of therapy
to patients with FL, and little is known about the association between delivered dose and clinical outcomes.
The National LymphoCare Study (NLCS) is a prospective, observational study of > 2700 patients with FL who
were enrolled at academic and community practice sites in the United States between 2004 and 2007. We previously
reported patterns of initial management strategies, demonstrating that just over one-half of patients are initially managed
with chemoimmunotherapy.6 Of those patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy, the most prevalent regimen was

rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) (50%), followed by rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
prednisone (R-CVP) (23%) and rituximab plus a
fludarabine-containing regimen (R-Flu) (17%), as well as
R-other combinations (9%). We now report for what to
our knowledge is the first time a quantitative assessment
of delivered dose and intensity for the 3 most common
regimens. We also described patient factors associated
with dose delivery as well as associations between delivered dose and patient outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between 2004 and 2007, patients with FL who were diagnosed within the previous 6 months and with no prior history of lymphoma were recruited from US community
practices and academic centers. All patients provided
informed consent. Collected data included demographics
such as date of birth, race, prior malignancies, and clinical
trial participation; clinical data such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Ann
Arbor stage of disease (highest known stage and studies
used to determine staging), the presence of B symptoms,
number of lymph node sites and extranodal sites, and
bone marrow or splenic involvement; laboratory data
such as complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase
(normal vs higher) and albumin; serial management strategies including drug choices but not doses; response to
treatment; and events such as disease recurrence and
death. Management decisions were made by the treating
physician according to clinical judgment. No treatment
regimen or prescribed intervention was specified, and the
number of cycles=doses required for treatment completion was not stipulated a priori.
All treatments (drugs and start=stop dates and number of cycles but not doses) that patients received for FL
were recorded, including the initial treatment regimen
and any subsequent therapy. Growth factor use was not
recorded. Treating physicians were asked if therapy was
completed and if so, how many cycles were administered.
The reason for discontinuation was requested when treatment was not completed, as was reason for the initiation
of all subsequent treatments. When initial management
was observation, this was recorded as the first strategy.
Patients who received therapy within 90 days of their date
of diagnosis were not included in the observation cohort
but were categorized by the initial treatment received. To
avoid bias that might arise from prespecified criteria,
patients enrolled in a prospective clinical trial dictating
treatment were analyzed as “investigational therapy” irre4130

spective of the regimen delivered on the trial and were not
reported in the current analysis.
All evaluable patients receiving treatment with RCHOP, R-CVP, or R-Flu were included in the current
analysis. Individuals with FL plus other lymphoma histology or no FL histology were excluded. Patients who
received treatment after an initial management strategy of
observation were not included, nor were patients who
received initial chemotherapy as part of combined modality therapy. Patients who went on to receive a maintenance course of therapy were analyzed according to their
induction chemoimmunotherapy.
Response and disease progression were assessed
locally, not centrally, in accordance with published International Working Group criteria.7 Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of
diagnosis to the date of first disease progression or death
from any cause. Time to next treatment (TTNT) was
defined as the time from the date of treatment initiation
to the date of initiation of a next treatment for any reason.
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the
date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause.
Lymphoma-related mortality (LRM) was defined as the
time from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from
lymphoma-related causes or toxicity related to lymphoma
treatment. Cycle intensity was defined as the expected
cycle length (21 days for R-CHOP and R-CVP and 28
days for R-Flu) divided by the actual cycle length (ie, a
cycle intensity > 1.1 indicated greater-than-expected intensity, a cycle intensity of 0.9-1.1 denoted cycles of
expected length, and a cycle intensity < 0.9 indicated lessthan-expected intensity).
Statistical Analysis

The associations between baseline characteristics and
choice of treatment (R-CHOP, R-CVP, or R-Flu), the
number of cycles received ( 4, 5-6, and > 7), and completion of therapy were assessed using the Pearson chisquare test for categorical variables and analysis of variance
for continuous variables. Associations between cycle intensity and treatment were assessed using the Pearson chisquare test. Factors associated with the risk of early discontinuation (treatment, age, stage of disease, and grade)
were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Factors associated with the number of treatment cycles were
assessed using a generalized logits model. Age-by-stage,
stage-by-grade, and all 2-way interactions with treatment
were examined using backward stepwise selection (using
P > .10). Kaplan-Meier survival methods were used to
generate estimates and curves for OS, PFS, TTNT, and

LRM stratified by treatment regimen and by the number
of treatment cycles within each regimen. Associations
between the number of treatment cycles for each treatment regimen and OS, PFS, TTNT, and LRM were
assessed using Cox regression with an interaction term for
the number of cycles by treatment regimen and adjusting
for Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index
(FLIPI) components (with age categorized as  50 years,
51 years-60 years, 61 years-70 years, and  71), ECOG
performance status, and the use of maintenance
rituximab.

The treatment characteristics are detailed in Table 2. The
distribution of the number of cycles delivered demonstrated a high degree of compliance with published regimens. The majority of patients (80%) received at least 5
cycles of treatment, and cycle intensity was as expected for
the majority of patients treated with R-CHOP and RCVP, but not for those who received R-Flu, among
whom a higher percentage of patients experienced both a
greater-than-expected and less-than-expected cycle intensity. Generalized logits modeling comparing the odds of
receiving  4 treatment cycles versus 5 to 6 cycles and > 7
treatment cycles versus 5 to 6 cycles (Table 3) showed that
compared with patients aged  50 years, those aged > 71
years had a greater odds of receiving  4 cycles (odds ratio
[OR], 2.37; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.443.89) and a lower odds of receiving  7 cycles (OR, 0.68;
95% CI, 0.39-1.18). Compared with individuals with
stage I to II disease, those with stage III to IV disease had a
reduced odds of receiving  4 cycles (OR, 0.55; 95% CI,
0.38-0.80). There was a significant interaction between
grade and the effect of the treatment selected on the number of treatment cycles received (P 5 .036). For patients
with grade 1 to 2 disease, R-CVP was associated with a
greater odds of receiving  7 cycles (OR, 1.61 [95% CI,
1.03-2.52] compared with R-CHOP), whereas R-Flu was
associated with a greater odds of receiving  4 cycles (OR,
2.23 [95% CI, 1.40-3.59] compared with R-CHOP). For
patients with grade 3 disease, the R-Flu regimen was again
associated with a greater odds of receiving  4 cycles (OR,
9.78 [95% CI, 3.59-26.60] compared with R-CHOP).

Patient Characteristics

The NLCS enrolled 2731 patients at 266 sites; approximately 80% of the patients were enrolled at community
sites. A total of 1165 patients were considered to be evaluable for the current analysis (Fig. 1). The demographic
and disease characteristics of the evaluable patients who
were treated with R-CHOP, R-CVP, or R-Flu are summarized in Table 1. A total of 646 patients were initially
managed with R-CHOP chemotherapy, 297 were initially managed with R-CVP chemotherapy, and 222 were
treated with R-Flu combinations. Patients in the 3 treatment groups were similar except that those receiving RCancer

that early discontinuation was associated with patient age

shown). Reasons for treatment discontinuation are listed
in Table 4. Toxicity was the most commonly cited reason
for early discontinuation, whereas disease progression was
rarely cited.
Patient Outcomes

The percentage of patients achieving a complete or partial
response was associated with the number of cycles received
only for those patients treated with R-CVP (P 5 .005),
with those receiving  4 treatment cycles (73.8%) having
a lower response rate compared with those receiving 5 to 6
cycles (90.7%) or  7 cycles (91.8%) (data not shown).
Although not statistically significant (P > .05), a similar
trend was noted for R-CHOP and R-Flu. After adjusting
for baseline factors and the use of rituximab maintenance,
the number of treatment cycles was associated with OS,
PFS, and LRM for patients receiving R-CVP (Table 5).

Flu. TTNT was significantly associated with the number
of cycles for R-CHOP, R-CVP, and R-Flu, with those
patients who received  4 cycles having a shorter interval
between first-line and second-line treatment than those
receiving  5 cycles (Table 5). A sensitivity analysis was
conducted excluding patients who discontinued planned
treatment early (eg, patients who may have not been able
to tolerate a full course of treatment). A similar relation
was noted between the number of treatment cycles and
OS, PFS, LRM, and TTNT for R-CVP. However, for RCHOP and R-Flu, there was no longer a significant association observed between the number of treatment cycles
and TTNT.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we report what to the best of our
knowledge is the first large prospective study of patterns
of delivery for common first-line chemoimmunotherapy
regimens in patients with FL in the United States. The
findings suggest that adherence to the recommended total
number of delivered cycles, as well as the cycle intensity, is
relatively high in the United States. This was true for RCHOP, which was the most commonly prescribed regimen during the 3 years of this observation study, as well as
for R-CVP, and was less apparent for fludarabine-based
chemoimmunotherapy regimens. The administration of
< 5 cycles or > 6 cycles did not appear to have a significant impact on patient outcomes for patients treated with
R-CHOP or R-Flu. Patients treated with < 5 cycles of RCVP were found to have inferior outcomes across all clinical endpoints in a multivariate Cox hazard model that
adjusted for maintenance therapy. If these results can be
replicated elsewhere, they should give caution to clinicians

considering the early cessation of R-CVP. It is interesting
to note that this study does not address the choice of a specific chemotherapy regimen or the use of posttreatment
rituximab maintenance.
The association between early discontinuation and
the R-Flu regimen is consistent with prospective randomized studies demonstrating the increased toxicity of
fludarabine-based regimens. The phase 3 ECOG 1496
trial was designed with a 2 3 2 factorial design comparing
frontline treatment with CVP versus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) and rituximab maintenance versus
observation. Due to an increased toxic death rate, the FC
arm was closed and the remaining patients were all treated
with CVP. The FOLL05 trial from the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi randomized 534 patients with previously
untreated follicular lymphoma to treatment with either
R-CHOP, R-CVP, or rituximab plus fludarabine and
mitoxantrone (R-FM).9 Patients treated with R-FM experienced significantly more grade 3 to 4 neutropenia than
those receiving R-CHOP or R-CVP (64% vs 50% vs
28%). In addition, patients treated with R-FM appeared
to experience a higher rate of subsequent cancers. Similar
findings were reported in a phase 3 trial in older patients
with mantle cell lymphoma.10 Although the results of the
current study indicated that toxicity was cited as the most
common reason for not completing planned therapy, it
accounted for early discontinuation in only 11% of
patients receiving R-Flu regimens, suggesting that
attempts to make fludarabine-based treatment more tolerable are unlikely to impact many patients. The TTNT
outcome was likely worse in patients treated with R-Flu
who received  4 cycles due to early changes in therapy
due to toxicity. This is supported by our observation that
TTNT was not affected by the number of cycles administered to patients receiving R-Flu or R-CHOP when only
those patients who were considered to have completed
therapy were analyzed (data not shown).

Contrary to population studies in patients with
DLBCL, the delivery of R-CHOP in patients with FL in
the current study was excellent.4,11 Predictors of low
chemotherapy dose among patients with DLBCL are
reported to include older age, advanced stage of disease,
poor performance status, and no prophylactic filgrastim.11 Due to the curative intent of therapy in patients
with DLBCL, treating physicians are likely to select RCHOP despite the probability of early discontinuation in
poor-risk patients. The older age and higher FLIPI scores
of the patients treated with R-CVP in the current study
suggest that clinicians avoided R-CHOP in patients with
FL who were less likely to tolerate it at the recommended
dose intensity, which is an appropriate strategy given the
lack of a proven OS benefit of R-CHOP over R-CVP in
patients with FL. The lack of an association between the
number of cycles of R-CHOP received and OS, PFS, and
LRM suggests that some patients with FL may not require
a full 6 cycles of treatment and that early surrogates for
duration of benefit (eg, interim 18F-fluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography status) should be
evaluated.
Despite their elevated age and higher FLIPI scores,
> 80% of patients receiving R-CVP completed at least 5
cycles, and only 13% did not complete planned therapy,
including 19 of 297 patients (6%) who withdrew from
treatment prematurely because of toxicity. Nonetheless,
patients who received  4 cycles of R-CVP had worse OS,
PFS, TTNT, and LRM compared with patients receiving
5 to 6 cycles. It is difficult to reconcile the low rate of early
cessation of therapy because of toxicity or disease progression with the poor PFS and LRM. At the very least, it
appears that stopping treatment prematurely did not benefit these patients, and it is unknown whether improving
the delivery of R-CVP would have made a significant difference. Although the delivery of  4 cycles of R-CVP
was associated with worse survival, this analysis does not
implicate causality.
There are several limitations to the current study.
Treatment decisions were made by the treating physician,
with no guidelines regarding treatment choice, duration,
criteria for withdrawing or changing treatment, or criteria
for retreatment. Because this was an observational study,
treatment decisions were not randomized and thus may
be biased by patient selection and other confounding factors. Therefore, replication in other patient populations is
needed. Nevertheless, the results of the current study are
reflective of clinical practice outside the clinical trial setting. The completion of therapy was defined by the treating physician after therapy was stopped, not a priori.

Bold type indicates statistical significance (P < .05).

Initially, the number of treatment cycles received by
patients who discontinued treatment early was not captured in the database and was instead collected retrospectively. When sensitivity analyses that excluded 128
patients from 46 closed sites were performed, similar
results were obtained.
Due to the time period over which patients on the
NLCS were enrolled, there are no data regarding the
frontline use of bendamustine. More recently, multiple
phase 3 trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of
the combination of bendamustine and rituximab compared with R-CHOP, R-CVP, or R-Flu.12-14 Despite the

increased toxicity of the non-bendamustine treatment
arms in those studies, treatment appeared to be delivered
as expected. Data from the current study support the concept that differences in efficacy between bendamustine
and the other regimens are not due to improved tolerability of the drug.
Unlike patients with DLBCL, to the best of our
knowledge very little has been published to date regarding
the importance of dose delivery in patients with FL.
Recent phase 3 trials have demonstrated that neither dose
intensity (high-dose therapy plus autologous stem cell
transplantation)15 nor dose density (R-CHOP-14 vs R4135

Original Article

CHOP-21, ie, R-CHOP given every 14 days vs every 21
days)16 impacts OS, and dose density has no impact on
PFS. The findings of the current study suggest that the
delivery of R-CHOP, R-CVP, and R-Flu regimens in the
United States is generally complete. With the possible
exception of R-CVP, strategies to improve dose delivery
appear unlikely to affect patient outcomes. Rather, the development of effective, well-tolerated, novel therapies
should be pursued.
