Abstract
Pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) binding factor (PBF; PTTG1IP) is a relatively uncharacterized oncoprotein whose function remains obscure. Because of the presence of putative estrogen response elements (ERE) in its
promoter, we assessed PBF regulation by estrogen. PBF mRNA and protein expression were induced by both diethylstilbestrol and 17β-estradiol in estrogen receptor α (ERα)–positive MCF-7 cells. Detailed analysis of the PBF promoter showed that the region −399 to −291 relative to the translational start site contains variable repeats of an 18-bp
sequence housing a putative ERE half-site (gcccctcGGTCAcgcctc). Sequencing the PBF promoter from 122 normal
subjects revealed that subjects may be homozygous or heterozygous for between 1 and 6 repeats of the ERE. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and oligonucleotide pull-down assays revealed ERα binding to the PBF promoter. PBF
expression was low or absent in normal breast tissue but was highly expressed in breast cancers. Subjects with
greater numbers of ERE repeats showed higher PBF mRNA expression, and PBF protein expression positively correlated with ERα status. Cell invasion assays revealed that PBF induces invasion through Matrigel, an action that
could be abrogated both by siRNA treatment and specific mutation. Furthermore, PBF is a secreted protein, and loss
of secretion prevents PBF inducing cell invasion. Given that PBF is a potent transforming gene, we propose that
estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women may upregulate PBF expression, leading to PBF secretion and
increased cell invasion. Furthermore, the number of ERE half-sites in the PBF promoter may significantly alter
the response to estrogen treatment in individual subjects. Cancer Res; 70(9); 3739–49. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Breast carcinogenesis requires multiple genetic changes, including the altered expression and function of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Most human breast cancers evolve
from normal epithelial cells in terminal duct lobular units
through a series of increasingly abnormal stages over long periods of time. Key stages in this progression are hyperplasia,
atypical hyperplasia, in situ carcinoma, invasive carcinoma,
and, finally, metastatic disease (1). Invasion into surrounding
stroma defines the transition from in situ to invasive carcinoma. However, most defects responsible for the development
and progression of malignant disease remain unknown (1).
Described in only nine publications (2–10), four of which
are from our own group (2, 3, 6, 8), Pituitary tumor trans-

forming gene (PTTG) binding factor (PBF) was identified
through its ability to interact with PTTG1, the human securin
(4). First isolated in 1997 (11), PTTG1 is an estrogen-regulated
gene (12, 13) previously implicated in breast cancer, with
highest expression in invasive and metastatic breast cancers
(14). Its binding partner PBF has not, however, been studied
in the context of breast cancer before.
Initially identified in 1998 (10), PBF comprises six exons
spanning 24 kb within chromosomal region 21q22.3. The
180–amino acid peptide sequence of PBF shares no significant homology with other human proteins but is highly conserved across a wide diversity of animal species (73%
homology to mouse, 67% frog, 60% chicken, 52% zebra fish),
suggesting both unique functionality and significant evolutionary importance.
PBF is ubiquitously expressed (15), but a decade after its
cloning, very little has been reported concerning its function. We previously characterized PBF expression in thyroid
cancers and showed it to be a transforming gene in vitro and
to be tumorigenic in vivo (8). Furthermore, high PBF expression was independently associated with poor prognosis in
human thyroid cancer. Most recently, we showed that PBF
repressed iodide uptake in thyroid cells, both through transcriptional regulation (3) and through altered subcellular
trafficking (6).
PBF is thus a relatively uncharacterized transforming gene
that plays a part in multiple cellular processes, particularly in
the setting of endocrine neoplasia. We now present extensive

data, outlined below, that suggest PBF represents an entirely
novel gene of direct relevance to breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Tissues. Breast tumor paraffin-embedded samples arranged on tissue microarrays (TMA) were available from
146 patients (16). There were 6 cases of ductal carcinoma
in situ, 4 cases of medullary carcinoma, 1 atypical medullary
carcinoma, 7 cases of mucinious type, 2 cases of tubular carcinoma, 22 cases of lobular carcinoma, 1 lobular-papillary,
and 1 benign tumor. A further 101 cases were designated
pathologically as being of no special type (breast tumors
not fitting the histologic categories above but tending to be
invasive ductal carcinomas that could not be further characterized on morphologic grounds; ref. 16). Clinical follow-up,
encompassing tumor grade, vascular invasion, lymph node
stage, Nottingham prognostic index, and estrogen receptor
(ER) status was available for the breast cancer series. Normal
breast paraffin-embedded samples were available from US
Biomax (n = 6).
Cell lines and hormonal treatments. MCF-7 human
Caucasian breast adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from
the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures in April
2008. Low passage number cells obtained from the original
stock were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were
treated with diethylstilbestrol (DES) and 17β-estradiol
(EST) at final concentrations of 10 nmol/L and 20 nmol/L,
respectively, and with ICI 182780 (Faslodex/Fulvestrant)
at 100 nmol/L and 1 μmol/L in RPMI 1640 phenol red–free
medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10%
charcoal-stripped serum.
RNA extraction, reverse transcription quantitative PCR,
and Western blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted from
MCF-7 cells using Sigma Trizol kit, as previously described
(3). RNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded tissues on microscope slides using the Pinpoint Slide RNA Isolation System
kit (Zymo Research). RNA was reverse transcribed using
Reverse Transcription System (Promega), as previously
described (3). Expression of specific mRNAs was determined
using 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems;
ref. 8). Western blot analyses were performed as we have
described previously (2, 6, 17, 18).
Cross-linking chromatin immunoprecipitation. Briefly,
MCF-7 cells were cross-linked by addition of 1% final concentration formaldehyde directly to 1.5 × 106 midexponential
cells. After sonication samples were immunoprecipitated
with Protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotech) with 5 μg
ER antibody (Santa Cruz), alongside an IgG sample as a background control (Abcam). Immunocomplexes were then
sequentially washed, and cross-links were removed before
DNA extraction. PBF promoter primers of sequence 5′GCA-GCC-CTT-TAG-GAT-GGA-G and 5′-GAG-GAA-AGGAGC-CTG-GTA-GC were then used with 5 μL of chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) DNA material for analysis by
semiquantitative PCR.

DNA extraction. Genomic DNA from normal and tumorous colorectal samples and normal thyroid specimens had
previously been extracted (17, 19). Normal DNA was also obtained from whole blood from patients with normal thyroid
function (20). Genomic DNA was isolated from breast tumor
and normal tissue, which had been formalin fixed and paraffin embedded using the Pinpoint Slide DNA Isolation System
kit (Zymo Research).
PCR. Two primer sets were designed to amplify the region
of the PBF promoter, which contains a repeated 18-bp
sequence. Forward (F) and reverse (R) sequences were
primer set 1(F) 5′-GCG-CTC-CCC-TAG-TCC-CCT-3′, primer
set 1(R) 5′-GCG-AGG-AGA-GCG-GCT-GA-3′; primer set 2(F)
5′-GCA-GCC-CTT-TAG-GAT-GGA-G-3′, primer set 2(R)
5′-GAG-GAA-AGG-AGC-CTG-GTA-GC-3′. Product sizes were
220 and 286 bp, respectively. Sequencing was carried out to
confirm estrogen response element (ERE) repeat numbers
using the forward primer of primer set 1 or 2.
Luciferase assays. The pGL3_PBFpromoter construct was
created by inserting bases −510 to −211 relative to the translational start site into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Cells
were harvested in passive lysis buffer (Promega). The Dual
Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) was used, and
data were expressed as a ratio of Renilla luciferase activity.
Biotinylated oligonucleotide pull-down assay. Pull-down
assays were essentially as described previously (21). Oligonucleotides of a consensus ERα binding sequence (22), 5′-GTCCAA-AGT-CAG-GTC-ACA-GTG-ACC-TGA-TCA-AAG-TT-3′,
PBF ERE sequence (half-sites in bold), 5′-CTC-GCC-CCTCGG-TCA-CGC-CTC-GCC-CCT-CGG-TCA-CGC-CTC-GCCCCT-CGG-TCA-CGC-CTC-GCC-CCT C-3′ and mutant PBF
ERE sequence (base changes underlined), 5′-CTC-GCC-CCTCAA-TTT-CGC-CTC-GCC-CCT-CAA-TTT-CGC-CTC-GCCCCT-CAA-TTT-CGC-CTC-GCC-CCT-C-3′ were 5′ end-labeled
with biotin and incubated with recombinant ERα protein
(P2187; Invitrogen, Ltd.). In competition reactions, recombinant protein was additionally incubated with 1 to 2 nmol of
nonbiotinylated oligonucleotide. DNA/protein complexes
were captured with 0.1 mg of magnetic streptavidin beads
(Promega). Subsequently, bound proteins were probed with
an anti-ERα antibody (Santa Cruz).
Immunohistochemistry. Normal and tumorous breast
specimens were immunostained using our specific rabbit
polyclonal antibody to PBF (1:200). For negative controls,
the primary antibody was replaced by 2% normal serum. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin, and
blinded scoring was carried out according to the intensity
(0, not present; +1, least intense; +3, most intense) and percentage (<25, 25–50, 50–75, >75) of PBF staining.
Invasion assays. MCF-7 cells transfected with vector only
(VO), hemagglutinin (HA)–tagged PBF (PBF-HA), or the PBF
mutant Δ29-93 were seeded onto BD Falcon cell culture inserts (pore size, 8 μmol/L). Subsequently, 800 μL of RPMI
1640 supplemented with 20% FBS or charcoal-stripped serum
were added to the well below the BD Falcon cell culture
inserts. For knockdown, cells were treated with either
50 nmol/L of scrambled (negative control 1, Ambion) or
PBF-specific siRNAs 14399 and 147350 (mixed in equal

quantities; Ambion). After 24 or 48 hours, cells were fixed and
stained using Mayer's H&E (Sigma).
MTT assays. Cells were transfected or treated with DES
and EST at final concentrations of 10 and 20 nmol/L. At 24
and 48 hours post-PBF transfection or 48 hours post-estrogen
treatment, 100 μg of MTT were added to each well, as previously described (23).
Detection of PBF secretion by Western blotting. Cell
lysates were harvested in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer. Cell medium was removed from MCF-7 cells
and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Supernatants
were then added to three volumes of 100% ethanol and
centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer.
Detection of PBF secretion by immunoprecipitating
radiolabeled PBF. Cells were maintained in 1 mL of medium
containing 2/3 standard medium and 1/3 leucine-free equivalent, along with 10 μCi L-leucine [3,4,5-3H] (MP Biomedicals). Media extracts were centrifuged to remove floating
cells. To obtain cell lysate fractions, cells were lysed in RIPA
buffer. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PBF antibody (5 μL; ref. 6) or
normal rabbit control serum (5 μL) was added to cell medium and lysate fractions. Immunocomplexes were pelleted by
centrifugation at 13,000 × g, and dpm was measured. Western

blot analysis of PBF immunoprecipitation confirmed that
PBF was specifically pulled down.
Immunofluorescent analysis of PBF vesicular localization.
MCF-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg PBF-HA and 1 μg
chromogranin A-GFP (24) on coverslips. Cells were fixed
and permeabilized before blocking. Rabbit polyclonal antiHA (Y-11) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used
as primary antibody, and Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) was used as secondary antibody.
Hoechst stain was used to visualize nuclei (1:1,000).
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using Sigma Stat
(SPSS Science Software UK Ltd.). Normally distributed data
were analyzed using a two-sample Student's t test. The
Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used for comparison between the two groups of nonparametric data. Data containing
categorical information were analyzed using the χ2 test and
Fisher's exact test.

cancer (14). We therefore examined whether PBF might
also be estrogen regulated. PBF mRNA expression was induced
48 hours after treatment by 10 and 20 nmol/L DES and 10 and
20 nmol/L EST in ERα-positive MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A). PBF protein expression levels were also significantly upregulated 2-fold
to 3-fold compared with vehicle controls (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, treatment with the anti-estrogen ICI 182780 at 100
nmol/L and 1 μmol/L concentrations repressed EST stimulation of PBF expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C).
To investigate whether EST stimulation of PBF expression
occurred directly through the PBF promoter, cross-linking
ChIP assays were carried out as described in Materials and
Methods. In each case (n = 4 experiments), ERα bound to the
human PBF promoter, with most pronounced binding occurring between 24 and 48 hours post-estrogen treatment in
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1D).

The human PBF promoter is polymorphic for ERE half-sites.
In silico analysis of the human PBF promoter identified
the region −399 to −292 relative to the translational start
site to be replete with putative EREs (Fig. 2A). Preliminary
sequencing of this region revealed that it contained variable
repeat numbers of an 18-bp sequence housing a putative
consensus ERE half-site (gcccctcGGTCAcgcctc; Fig. 2A).
PCR and sequencing of the region were additionally
examined with a separate set of primers, confirming the
existence of polymorphic numbers of 18-bp repeats (Fig. 2A).
A panel of 92 genomic DNA samples was available to us,
DNA being prepared from normal thyroid and colon tissue
and from tumorous colon. PCR and sequencing revealed
that subjects may be homozygous or heterozygous for
between one and six repeats of the 18-bp region housing
the ERE (Fig. 2B). We next examined ERE repeat number

Figure 2. Polymorphism of the PBF promoter. A, a hypervariable region between −399 and −292 upstream of the ATG contains between 1 and 6 repeats of

treatment. D, oligonucleotide pull-down assay of recombinant human ERα binding to three ERE half-sites in the human PBF promoter (PBF). NEG, negative

PBF in Breast Cancer

in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast TMA samples. Of
the ∼60 tumors assessed, 27 tumors gave informative sequencing data for ERE repeat number, and three of the six normals
yielded unambiguous sequence data. These studies revealed
that breast tumors could either be homozygous (three and
three repeats) or heterozygous (three and five repeats), whereas
the n = 3 normal breast specimens were all homozygous for
three repeats (Fig. 2B). None of the other variants were detected
in breast DNA. Overall, as each 18-bp repeat houses a putative
consensus ERE half-site, subjects therefore differ in the number
of EREs present in their PBF promoter.
The promoter region −399 to −292 is estrogen responsive.
Having determined that PBF is regulated by estrogen and that
ERα binds to the PBF promoter in ChIP assays and having
identified a polymorphic region in the human PBF promoter
containing variable numbers of putative ERE half-sites, we
next examined the estrogen responsiveness of this fragment
of the promoter. DES and EST (20 nmol/L) both induced significant luciferase activity compared with vehicle-treated
cells after 24 hours (Fig. 2C). At 48 hours, the effect was more
pronounced (DES, 1.8 ± 0.2-fold, P < 0.01 compared with vehicle, n = 3; EST, 1.7 ± 0.3-fold, P < 0.05 compared with vehicle,
n = 3; Fig. 2C).
Next, we investigated whether the polymorphic ERE halfsites identified within the promoter region −399 to −292 were
capable of binding ERα directly. We performed pull-down assays using oligonucleotides containing either a series of three
wild-type (WT) or three mutated PBF ERE half-site repeats.
Recombinant human ERα bound specifically to the biotinylated double-stranded PBF ERE oligonucleotide (Fig. 2D),
which could be competed out by incubation with increasing
excesses of unlabeled PBF oligonucleotide. Furthermore,
recombinant ERα bound a biotinylated consensus doublestranded ERE oligonucleotide, and binding was repressed
by competition with unlabeled WT PBF ERE oligonucleotide
but not by the mutated PBF oligonucleotide in which the
EREs had been abolished. As PBF mRNA was induced 1.5-fold
to 3-fold at identical time points and at identical doses of
estrogen (Fig. 1), these data indicate that the short promoter
region −510 to −211 is positively regulated by estrogen and
confers most, but not all, of PBF's responsiveness to DES
and EST. In addition, the specific ERE half-site region identified within the promoter region −399 to −292 is capable of
binding ERα, suggesting that the main mechanism of estrogen regulation of PBF is directly via the polymorphic EREs of
the proximal promoter.
PBF expression and correlation in a breast tumor series.
We next investigated whether PBF was expressed in human
breast tumors. Initial mRNA investigations used 20 breast
TMA specimens and 6 normal breast specimens. PBF mRNA
expression was apparent in RNA extracted from 18 of 20 TMA
tumor samples, with a mean Taqman reverse transcription–
PCR (RT-PCR) ΔCt of ∼8 to 10, suggesting robustly detectable
levels of expression (Fig. 3A). Reverse transcriptase negative
controls confirmed that amplification in the tumor samples
examined was not an artifact of genomic DNA contamination
(data not shown). In contrast, PBF mRNA was not detected in
any of the six normal breast specimens analyzed (Fig. 3A).

www.aacrjournals.org

PBF protein expression was next quantified in a larger
series of normal breast specimens (n = 8) and TMA tumor
samples (n = 146) through immunohistochemistry, using
our rabbit polyclonal antibody (6). Examples of scoring intensities are provided in Fig. 3B. PBF expression was low
or absent in normal breast tissue, whereas it was strongly
expressed in epithelial cells of all tumor types and grades
of breast tumor assessed (Fig. 3C). Specificity of staining
was confirmed in negative control experiments (data not
shown). Importantly, ERα status positively and significantly
correlated with the percentage of PBF protein expression
(P < 0.001). However, the remaining phenotypic end-points
examined (tumor grade, vascular invasion, lymph node
stage, or Nottingham prognostic index) were not associated
with PBF staining intensity or percentage expression.
Next, we investigated the relationship between ERE number and PBF mRNA expression. Eight fixed tumor specimens
and three normal breast samples yielded both mRNA and
promoter sequencing data. PBF expression was apparent in
86% of three and five heterozygotes but only 25% of three and
three homozygotes (P = 0.044). Thus, PBF is estrogen regulated, its expression is higher in ER-positive than ER-negative
tumors, and a greater number of ERE repeats is associated
with higher PBF expression.
PBF and estrogen both induce invasiveness in MCF-7
cells. The exact function of PBF in cell transformation is
not known (8). Given that PBF is induced in breast cancer
and that invasion and metastasis are critical processes in
breast cancer progression, we next assessed whether PBF
might play a role in cell invasion.
When 1 × 105 cells per well were seeded in invasion assays,
PBF overexpression was associated with a 2.5 ± 0.6-fold
increased cell invasion compared with VO treatment at
24 hours (n = 6, P < 0.01) and a 6.1 ± 2.9-fold increase at
48 hours (n = 6, P < 0.01; Fig. 4A). At a density of 2 × 105 cells
per well, PBF induced a 2.5 ± 0.3-fold increase in cell invasion
after 48 hours (n = 6, P < 0.01).
To determine whether the enhanced invasiveness of
MCF-7 cells following PBF transfection reflected an increase
in cell proliferation, MCF-7 cells were transfected with VO or
PBF, and cell number estimated after 24 and 48 hours using
MTT assays (Fig. 4B). PBF did not significantly increase the
proliferation of MCF-7 cells after 24 hours but did marginally
(∼10%) increase cell number after 48 hours. These data
suggest that increased proliferation does not explain PBF's
influence upon invasion.
PBF confers estrogen induction of MCF-7 cell invasion.
As estrogen induces PBF and MCF-7 cells are well documented as an estrogen-responsive cell line, we next examined the
influence of treatment with 10 nmol/L DES on cell invasion.
DES treatment induced MCF-7 cell invasion by ∼2.3-fold
compared with vehicle treatment (n = 3, P < 0.001; Fig. 5A).
DES and EST (10 and 20 nmol/L) treatment did not significantly alter MCF-7 cell proliferation (data not shown).
Subsequently, we validated transient knockdown of PBF in
MCF-7 cells using siRNA. PBF-specific siRNA (50 nmol/L) elicited ∼80% to 90% knockdown compared with a scrambled
control (Fig. 5B). Cell invasion assays were then repeated

Critically, the increased cell invasion observed after DES
treatment in the presence of a scrambled control (103 ± 17
cells, P = 0.002, n = 2) was abolished when PBF was simultaneously knocked down using a PBF-specific siRNA (27 ±
14 cells, P = not significant, n = 2; Fig. 5C). These data suggest
that estrogen induction of MCF-7 cell invasion through
Matrigel is mediated via PBF.
PBF is a secreted protein. As the induction of invasion
by PBF could not be explained by increased cell number

www.aacrjournals.org

and because cell invasion is a process frequently associated
with secretion, we assessed whether PBF is a secreted protein.
MCF-7 cells were grown in the presence of L-leucine [3,4,5-3H],
cell medium fractions were harvested after 24 hours, and immunoprecipitations were carried out with our PBF antibody
(Fig. 6). Immunoprecipitation of labeled PBF revealed that
PBF is indeed a secreted protein with vector-only transfected
MCF-7 cells showing that ∼20% of total cellular PBF is secreted over the experimental time frame of 24 hours (Fig. 6A).
This was significantly enhanced by transient overexpression

of PBF (49 ± 3% secretion, n = 3, P < 0.05 compared with VO).
Furthermore, a mutant of PBF lacking amino acids 29 to 93
(and hence, a functional signal peptide and two potential putative glycosylation sites; ref. 6) showed reduced secretion into
the cell medium compared with WT (28 ± 7%, n = 3) but did not
differ statistically from VO (Fig. 6A).
To confirm that PBF is secreted into the cell medium, we
further carried out Western blotting for PBF-HA. Cell lysates showed successful transfection of PBF-HA (Fig. 6B).
Wild-type PBF is a putative glycoprotein (10), which runs
as a doublet at around 25 to 30 kDa. Mutant Δ29-93 was,
as anticipated, smaller and ran at ∼20 kDa (Fig. 6B).
Whereas WT PBF was easily detectable in cell media, confirming that PBF is a secreted protein, mutant Δ29-93 was
not apparent.
To investigate the mechanism by which PBF is secreted,
MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with PBF-HA and chromogranin A-GFP. Chromogranin A-GFP is a chimeric photoprotein that is transported via the regulated pathway for
exocytosis (24) and has recently been used as a marker for
secretory granules in MCF-7 cells (25). As shown previously
in other cell lines, PBF-HA was found within intracellular vesicles, often detected toward the periphery of cells (6), in

keeping with a secretory phenotype (Fig. 6C). Although these
vesicles were localized in a similar pattern to the chromogranin A-GFP–labeled secretory granules, no colocalization
with PBF was observed. This suggests that PBF is secreted
via the constitutive pathway of secretion rather than via
regulated secretion. Overall then, PBF is secreted by MCF-7
cells, higher expression results in increased secretion, and deletion of the amino acid region Δ29-93 results in significantly
attenuated secretion into the cell medium.
Induction of MCF-7 cell invasion is modulated by PBF
secretion. Having shown that PBF is secreted by MCF-7 cells,
we investigated the relationship between secretion and invasion. As before, PBF induced significant cell invasion when
overexpressed (269 ± 52 invading cells, n = 10 experiments,
P = 0.018 compared with VO control; Fig. 6C). However, mutant Δ29-93 failed to induce cell invasion compared with VO
(161 ± 45 invading cells, n = 10 experiments, P = 0.518 compared with VO). Thus, secretion of PBF contributes significantly to its induction of cell invasion.
In summary, PBF is a relatively uncharacterized protooncogene that is induced by estrogen in MCF-7 cells, shows
increased expression in breast cancer, and stimulates cell
invasion, at least in part through secretion. On this basis,

PBF warrants further and intensive study in the context of
breast cancer initiation and progression.

Discussion
Numerous genetic changes governing the initiation, progression, and metastasis of breast cancer have already been
described, but new genetic markers and therapeutic targets
are vital for continued progress in addressing the approximately half-million global deaths annually from the disease.
Based on our investigations, we propose four principle lines
of evidence suggesting a critical role of PBF in breast cancer. First, PBF is highly expressed in breast tumors, where
its expression correlates with ER positivity. Second, it is
regulated by DES and EST, both at the mRNA and protein
level. Third, PBF upregulation results in significant MCF-7
cell invasion through Matrigel, a phenomenon highly dependent upon PBF secretion. Fourth, repressing PBF expression in the face of estrogen stimulation prevents
estrogen-mediated induction of cell invasion. Hence, estrogen regulates PBF expression in MCF-7 cells, tumors show
increased levels of the protein, and its functional property
in promoting invasion can be ameliorated both through
mutation and knockdown.
Although highly conserved, the 180–amino acid peptide sequence of PBF shares no significant homology with other human proteins. Its exact mechanisms of action have not been
divined, but it has been shown to induce tumors in nude
mice (8), to regulate expression and function of the sodium
iodide symporter (3, 6), and to interact with the human securin PTTG (4). Our experiments are the first to report a role
for PBF in the breast and to elucidate a function in cell invasion. We now propose that estrogen regulates PBF mRNA
and protein expression and suggest that this is mediated predominantly by a cluster of ERE half-sites ∼300 bp upstream
of the translational start site.
One surprising finding of our preliminary sequence analysis was that the human PBF promoter is polymorphic for
an 18-bp repeat housing a putative ERE half-site. Importantly, a higher number of putative EREs were statistically
associated with greater PBF mRNA expression in the breast
and ER-positive tumors having significantly increased PBF
protein expression compared with ER-negative tumors. Although these findings would need to be confirmed in a larger series of samples, a higher number of EREs in a breast
tumor would therefore predict a greater response to circulating estrogen and hence increased expression of a known
transforming gene.
Estrogen has previously been shown to enhance expression of PTTG, the binding partner of PBF (12, 13), and
PTTG upregulation has been described in breast cancer
(14). Whereas it was not the focus of the current investigation, it would be interesting to correlate PTTG and PBF expression in individual breast tumors. The functional
implications of simultaneous overexpression are hard to
gauge, given that both proteins are inherently multifunctional and likely to have dependent and independent modes
of action. However, future studies may delineate the

3748

individual contributions of each gene to breast cancer initiation and progression.
Our in vitro experiments were predominantly carried out in
MCF-7 cells, which remain the “gold standard” ERα-positive
and estrogen-sensitive breast cell line (26). Furthermore,
MCF-7 cells are weakly invasive (27), allowing us to perform
physiologically relevant invasion assays.
Our wider clinical associations did not reveal striking associations between PBF expression and tumor phenotype,
which was unexpected. Clinical associations were hampered
by a lack of a matched normal/tumor cohort, which would
allow a more detailed interrogation of the association between promoter polymorphism and clinical outcome. Furthermore, fresh tissue would have allowed us to perform
Western blotting for PBF expression, which would have
provided more quantitative expression data than through
immunohistochemistry on FFPE slides.
The mechanism by which PBF induces cell transformation
is not known. Our current study suggests that this might be
via the induction of cell invasion. MCF-7 cells showed potent increases in invasion through Matrigel in response to
PBF transfection. A mutant PBF, which was not secreted
into the cell medium, lost this phenotype. Furthermore, a
specific siRNA entirely blocked estrogen induction of cell
invasion. Thus, we hypothesize that estrogen induces PBF,
which in turn drives breast cell invasion, at least in part
through secretion. As estrogen stimulation of PBF expression was abrogated by cotreatment with the anti-estrogen
ICI 182780, ER antagonists might be useful in treating
tumors with high PBF expression to block potential cell
invasion mediated by PBF.
In summary, we present evidence that the poorly characterized proto-oncogene PBF has particular relevance to
breast tumorigenesis, particularly with respect to progression. Based on our in vitro and ex vivo findings, we predict
that estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women may
upregulate PBF expression, leading to increased PBF secretion. Given that individuals have different numbers of ERE
repeats, it is likely that estrogen will stimulate PBF expression variably, with a potentially critical effect upon breast
cell invasion.
