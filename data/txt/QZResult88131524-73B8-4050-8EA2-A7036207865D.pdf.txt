Somatic mutations that lead to constitutive activation of NRAS and KRAS proto-oncogenes are among the most common in human
cancer and frequently occur in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). An inducible NRAS(V12)-driven AML mouse model has established a
critical role for continued NRAS(V12) expression in leukemia maintenance. In this model genetic suppression of NRAS(V12)
expression results in rapid leukemia remission, but some mice undergo spontaneous relapse with NRAS(V12)-independent (NRI)
AMLs providing an opportunity to identify mechanisms that bypass the requirement for Ras oncogene activity and drive leukemia
relapse. We found that relapsed NRI AMLs are devoid of NRAS(V12) expression and signaling through the major oncogenic Ras
effector pathways, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase, but express higher levels of an alternate Ras
effector, Ralb, and exhibit NRI phosphorylation of the RALB effector TBK1, implicating RALB signaling in AML relapse. Functional
studies conﬁrmed that inhibiting CDK5-mediated RALB activation with a clinically relevant experimental drug, dinaciclib, led to
potent RALB-dependent antileukemic effects in human AML cell lines, induced apoptosis in patient-derived AML samples in vitro
and led to a 2-log reduction in the leukemic burden in patient-derived xenograft mice. Furthermore, dinaciclib potently suppressed
the clonogenic potential of relapsed NRI AMLs in vitro and prevented the development of relapsed AML in vivo. Our ﬁndings
demonstrate that Ras oncogene-independent activation of RALB signaling is a therapeutically targetable mechanism of escape
from NRAS oncogene addiction in AML.

INTRODUCTION
Despite aggressive combination chemotherapy, the majority of
patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) die of relapsed
treatment refractory disease.1 Furthermore, a large number of
older and/or unﬁt AML patients cannot tolerate intensive
treatment approaches and are cured o 10% of the time.1 The
disappointing outcomes with conventional treatment approaches
for AML have driven intense interest in safer and more effective
targeted treatment approaches. While the genetic landscape of
AML has been extensively characterized, genetically based
targeted therapies have yet to be realized and the optimal
therapeutic target(s) are not known.2,3
RAS proto-oncogenes are mutated in about 10–15% of human
AML, and additional recurring AML mutations rely on Ras signaling
for their oncogenic effects (that is, PTPN11, NF1, FLT3-ITD and KIT).3–6
A critical role for oncogenic Nras and Kras in leukemogenesis and
maintenance of AML cells has been substantiated in genetically
engineered mouse models.7–10 Furthermore, the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3kinase (PI3K) pathways downstream of Ras have been shown to
regulate leukemic stem cell self-renewal in AML.11 In fact,
the MAPK and PI3K pathways are active in the majority of
1

patient-derived AML samples, further supporting a key role for Ras
signaling in AML maintenance.12,13
Oncogenic RAS mutations are among the most common
molecular alterations in human cancer, and thus Ras has been
the focus of intense interest for drug development.14 A major
obstacle for targeted cancer treatment approaches has been the
almost ubiquitous development of treatment resistance. For
example, disruption of the post-translational modiﬁcation of Ras
with farnasyltransferase inhibitors demonstrated encouraging
preclinical activity, but their clinical activity has been limited
owing to resistance conferred by alternative biochemical pathways for the prenylation of Ras.15 Targeting BRAF and/or MEK has
shown encouraging responses for BRAF(V600E) mutant non-smallcell lung cancer and melanoma, but responses have been variable
and transient owing to treatment resistance.16–20 It has become
clear that diverse mechanisms such as disruption of drug–target
interaction, mutations or ampliﬁcations that lead to activation of
downstream signaling pathways, and/or activation of alternative
growth and survival pathways can lead to resistance to most, if
not all, targeted cancer therapies.21,22 Therefore, a better understanding of disease and context-speciﬁc resistance mechanisms

RESULTS
Suppressing Ras oncogene expression in NRAS(V12)-driven AML
leads to spontaneous relapse with NRI disease
We leveraged the tNM AML model to investigate potential
mechanisms of relapse after targeting the Ras oncogene in
AML.8 In this system, suppression of NRAS(V12) expression resulted
in rapid leukemia regression (Figure 1). Notably, some mice
spontaneously relapsed with NRI AMLs despite continued Dox
treatment (Figure 1). Relapsed NRI AMLs were harvested for
further characterization (relapsed NRI1 and NRI2 AMLs).
We conﬁrmed NRAS oncogene independence of relapsed NRI
AMLs by transplanting NRI1 and NRI2 AMLs into secondary
recipients. Unlike the parental de novo NRD AML, relapsed NRI1
and NRI2 AMLs did not regress after in vivo Dox treatment, and
mice rapidly succumbed from progressive leukemia (Figure 2a).
Similarly, ex vivo treatment of leukemia cells with Dox potently
suppressed the clonogenic potential of de novo NRD but
not relapsed NRI1 or NRI2 AMLs (Figure 2b). Western blotting
excluded the possibility of aberrant re-expression of NRAS(V12) in
relapsed NRI AMLs in the presence of Dox treatment, thereby
conﬁrming the NRAS(V12) independence of the relapsed NRI AMLs
(Figure 2c).

reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analyses of key cancer
signaling pathways. Flow cytometric analysis conﬁrmed a
decrease in canonical oncogenic Ras effector signaling pathways
—MAPK and PI3K—with decreased levels of phosphorylated ERK
and AKT following Dox-mediated suppression of NRAS(V12) in
both de novo NRD and relapsed NRI AML cells (Figure 3a).
Phosphorylation of TBK1, a key target of RALB signaling, was
decreased after Dox-mediated NRAS(V12) suppression in de novo
NRD AML, but was maintained at higher levels in relapsed NRI
AMLs, even in the absence of NRAS(V12) expression (Figure 3a).
The expression of BCL-xL and BCL2 proteins, which are established

WBC (x1000 per µL)

will be essential to develop rational combination strategies for
speciﬁc diseases.
To model Ras oncogene-targeted therapy for AML, we used a
tetracycline-repressible NRAS(V12) and Mll-AF9-driven AML genetically engineered mouse model (tNM AML).8 The leukemia cells in
this model are NRAS(V12)-dependent (NRD), and suppressing NRAS
(V12) expression leads to rapid remission in leukemic mice, further
highlighting the clinical potential of targeting oncogenic NRAS in
AML.8 This model faithfully recapitulates the key challenge for
clinically targeted cancer treatment, in that some mice spontaneously relapse with NRAS(V12)-independent (NRI) AML, providing
a robust tool to study the mechanisms of relapse after Ras
oncogene-targeted therapy. We interrogated key cancer signaling
pathways, performed global gene expression analysis and
performed functional studies to identify mechanisms that drive
relapse with NRI AML and provide insight into the rational
development of novel targeted treatment approaches for AML.

targets of RALB-TBK1 signaling, were also maintained at higher
levels in relapsed NRI AMLs (Figure 3a and Supplementary
Figure S1). Proapoptotic proteins BIM, BAD and BAX were
expressed at lower levels in NRI AMLs (Supplementary
Figure S2), suggesting that an altered balance of pro- and
antiapoptotic proteins contributes to the survival of relapsed
NRI AML cells. There were no differences in the expression
levels or activation of other Ras effector proteins, oncoproteins or
tumor suppressor proteins that were evaluated (Supplementary
Figure S2).
We complemented our ﬂow cytometric analysis by performing
RPPA analysis.23 Of the 292 epitopes interrogated, 27 showed

different levels of protein expression or phosphorylation between
Dox-treated NRD AML and relapsed NRI AMLs (Supplementary
Table S1 and Figure 3b). We observed lower levels of Rasassociated proteins including PI3K p85, BRAF(p445), mTOR and
PKC βII(p660) in relapsed NRI AMLs compared with NRD AML.
Consistent with our ﬂow cytometric analysis, relapsed NRI AMLs
also expressed lower levels of proapoptotic mediators BIM and
BAX. Relapsed NRI AMLs also had lower levels of CHK1(p296) and
increased levels of YAP and CDK1 compared with NRD AMLs.
Notably, YAP has been shown to mediate resistance to MAPK
targeted therapy and can reverse Kras oncogene addiction in a
Kras oncogene-driven pancreatic cancer model.24,25

Next-generation RNA sequencing of de novo NRD and relapsed
NRI AMLs
We then explored potential mechanisms driving the NRAS
oncogene independence of relapsed NRI AMLs using nextgeneration RNA sequencing. We interrogated gene expression
and transcript characteristics of Dox-treated NRD cells and NRI
AMLs. This analysis identiﬁed 3606 transcripts that were differentially expressed between both NRD vs NRI1 and NRD vs NRI2 AMLs
(Figure 4a). No consistent single-nucleotide variations, copy
number alterations by array comparative genomic hybridization
or fusion transcripts were identiﬁed other than the Mll-AF9 fusion
knock-in gene that is known to be present in both NRD and NRI
AMLs (data not shown).8 NRI1 and NRI2 AML cells were more
similar to each other than NRD AML cells as determined by
unsupervised clustering. Notably, NRI1 and NRI2 samples did not
segregate in unsupervised clustering based on all identiﬁed
transcripts (Figure 4b), suggesting that they may share a common
mechanism for NRI growth and survival.
We performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify enriched
cellular processes, signaling pathways and predicted upstream

regulators of differentially expressed genes (Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3). The Tec kinase pathway was among the most
activated pathways in relapsed NRI AMLs compared with de novo
NRD AML (z-score 4.333, P = 5.888 × 10 − 6). Bruton’s tyrosine
kinase, a member of the Tec kinase family, has been identiﬁed
as a targetable pathway in AML.26–28 The PI3K signaling pathway
was the most inhibited pathway in relapsed NRI AMLs compared
with de novo NRD AML (z-score = − 3.087, P = 2.570 × 10 − 5),
consistent with their decreased dependence on canonical Ras
signaling. The canonical nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway was
activated in relapsed NRI AMLs compared with de novo NRD AML
(z-score = 2.111, P = 1.479 × 10 − 4) and NFKB1 was among the
predicted activated upstream regulators in relapsed NRI AML cells
(z-score = 2.603, P = 2.000 × 10 − 4). Other predicted upstream
regulators that were activated in relapsed NRI AMLs included
HOXA9 (z-score = 2.865, P = 5.420 × 10 − 7), CEBPA (z-score = 2.307,
P = 2.510 × 10 − 12) and STAT3 (z-score = 2.084, P = 1.340 × 10 − 10)
that have established roles in AML.29–31
Many transcriptional regulators were differentially expressed
between de novo NRD AML and relapsed NRI AMLs (Supplementary

Table S4). The leukemogenic transcription factors Gﬁ1 and Myb
were among the most highly upregulated in relapsed NRI AMLs
compared with the de novo NRD AML. ID1, a transcriptional
regulator that cooperates with oncogenic Ras in the development
of metastatic breast cancer, was also upregulated in relapsed NRI
AMLs.32 Similar to ﬂow cytometric and RPPA analyses, several
mediators of apoptosis were differentially expressed between de
novo NRD and relapsed NRI AMLs (Supplementary Figure S3).
Notably, relapsed NRI AMLs expressed lower levels of proapoptotic
Bim and higher levels of antiapoptotic Bcl2 transcripts.
To further investigate the role of RALB signaling as a mediator
of NRAS(V12) independence for relapsed NRI AMLs we evaluated
the differential expression of genes that are known to be
associated with RALB activation and signaling (Figure 4c). Notably,
Cdk5 and Rgl2, positive regulators or RALB activation, were both
enriched in relapsed NRI AMLs compared with de novo NRD
AML.33,34 Ralb was also upregulated in relapsed NRI AMLs, and
RALB effectors including components of the nuclear factor-κB
transcriptional complex, Nfkb1 and Rel, and prosurvival Bcl2 were
also enriched in relapse NRI AMLs compared with de novo NRD
AML. Other noncanonical IκB kinases, IκBKβ and IκBKε, were also
upregulated in relapsed NRI AMLs. Taken together, the differential
expression of RALB-associated proteins and genes support a key
role for RALB signaling in NRI AML relapse.
Inhibition of RALB activation with dinaciclib has potent
antileukemic effects on human AML cells in vitro
While clinically relevant direct Ras-like (Ral) inhibitors are lacking,
dinaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, has been shown to
inhibit CDK5-mediated activation of Ral signaling.33,35 We
evaluated the effects of dinaciclib on RALB signaling in AML cell
lines. In vitro treatment of human KG1 AML cells with dinaciclib
potently inhibited RALB activation, resulting in a dose-dependent
reduction in RALB-GTP levels (Figure 5a). Dinaciclib treatment also
led to reduced phosphorylation of the RALB target TBK1 and
increased cleavage of apoptotic effector, CASP3 (Figures 5b and c),
but did not alter the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the
cell cycle (Figure 5c). Dinaciclib potently reduced leukemic cell
viability with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration in the low
nanomolar range for a panel of genetically diverse human AML
cell lines (THP1, KG1, Kasumi-1, K562 and MV4-11; Figure 1d and
Supplementary Figure S4). To verify the RALB-dependent effects
of dinaciclib on AML cells, we rescued the clonogenic potential of
THP1 cells by ectopically expressing constitutively activated RALB
(Q72L)36 (Figure 5e). Notably, ectopic expression of constitutively
activated forms of other major Ras effectors, myristoylated AKT
(myrAKT) or CRAF 22W, did not effectively rescue leukemic colony
formation (Figure 5e).
Dinaciclib induces apoptosis in patient-derived AML samples
in vitro and has potent antileukemic activity in preclinical AML
models in vivo
We then evaluated effects of dinaciclib on primary patient-derived
AML samples. We previously found that primary AML samples
have increased levels of RALB-TBK1 signaling compared with
normal blood mononuclear cells from healthy mobilized peripheral blood donors.37 In vitro treatment of a panel of AML samples
with dinaciclib uniformly resulted in decreased phosphorylation of
TBK1 and increased cleavage of CASP3, while normal mononuclear cells from healthy donors were relatively insensitive to
dinaciclib treatment (Figure 6). There was not a clear relationship
between the response to treatment and the clinical characteristics
of the samples (Supplementary Table S5).
To further evaluate the translational potential of our ﬁndings,
we tested the in vivo activity of dinaciclib against human AML cell
line mouse xenografts. Mice with established leukemia were
treated with ﬁve daily doses of 20 mg/kg dinaciclib or control

vehicle. A ﬁve-day regimen reduced the leukemic burden in
human THP1-luciferase mouse xenografts compared with controls
(Figure 7a). We then evaluated the activity of dinaciclib against
patient-derived AML mouse xenografts (PDX). Leukemic PDX mice
were treated with ﬁve daily doses of 20 mg/kg dinaciclib or
control vehicle. Treatment with dinaciclib led to a marked
reduction in bone marrow involvement by human AML cells and
a 2-log reduction in absolute leukemic burden compared with
control treated PDX mice (Figure 7b).
Inhibition of RALB activation potently suppresses leukemic colony
formation and prevents NRI AML relapse
To explore the therapeutic potential for inhibiting RALB activation
in relapsed NRI AMLs, we evaluated the activity of dinaciclib
against de novo NRD and relapsed NRI AMLs. Treatment of de novo
NRD AML and relapsed NRI AMLs with dinaciclib resulted in a
dose-dependent reduction in leukemic colony formation in the
low nanomolar range (Figure 8a). Similarly, inhibition of BCL2
family proteins with ABT-737 or ABT-199 suppressed the
clonogenic potential of de novo NRD AML and relapsed NRI AMLs
(Figure 8a), consistent with the established role of BCL2 proteins
to support cancer cell survival downstream of RALB.38
We then evaluated the in vivo activity of dinaciclib in human
preclinical AML mouse models. To increase the frequency of AML
relapse in the tNM model, we transferred a 1:1 ratio of de novo
NRD AML and relapsed NRI1 AML cells into recipient mice.
Leukemic mice were assigned to treatment with control vehicle,
Dox (to suppress NRAS(V12) expression), or dinaciclib (Figure 8b).
The leukemia initially regressed in Dox-treated mice, but mice
relapsed between 3 and 4 weeks despite continued Dox
treatment. Conversely, dinaciclib induced a prompt response in
leukemic mice, and none of the dinaciclib-treated mice relapsed
out to 40 days, further supporting the role of RALB activation in
relapse with NRI AML and demonstrating the therapeutic potential
of targeting this pathway.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated potential mechanisms that bypass
the requirement for NRAS(V12) in AML and represent putative
mechanisms of resistance to therapeutically targeting oncogenic
NRAS. In the NRAS(V12)-addicted tNM AML mouse model, some
mice spontaneously relapsed with NRAS oncogene-independent
AML despite continued suppression of NRAS(V12) expression. The
spontaneous relapse seen after mimicking RAS oncogene-targeted
cancer therapy closely resembles the major clinical challenge for
targeted cancer therapies in general,15–22,39,40 and conﬁrm that
NRAS(V12)-addicted AML cells can acquire alternative mechanisms
for maintained growth and survival and survive in the absence of
the NRAS oncogene. With renewed efforts to therapeutically target
oncogenic Ras proteins, our results have important implications
for anticipating therapeutic challenges for such treatment
strategies.41,42 Speciﬁcally, we found that relapsed AMLs developed an NRI mechanism to maintain signaling through RALB. The
ability of inhibition of RALB signaling to suppress the clonogenic
potential of relapsed NRI AML and to prevent AML relapse in
leukemic mice supports further investigation of this pathway as a
therapeutic target. Furthermore, the potent antileukemic effect of
inhibiting RALB signaling in human AML, including patientderived AML cells in vitro and in vivo, highlights the translational
potential for our ﬁndings.
There is mounting evidence that the activation and cellular
localization of Ral GTPase effector proteins have an important
role in Ras-driven transformation, proliferation, migration and
survival.43 Consistent with this, we recently demonstrated a key
role for RALB in AML cell survival.37 RALA or RALB activity are
essential for cancer cell proliferation in a murine KRAS-driven nonOncogene (2017) 3263 – 3273

innate immune signaling, chronically activated RALB associates
with SEC5 in the exocyst complex and activates the noncanonical
IκB kinase family member TBK1, a critical mediator of RALB’s

oncogenic activity.45 The mechanism by which the RALB-TBK1
axis supports cancer cell survival remains unclear and are
likely context and disease dependent, but have been shown to
involve regulators of normal innate immune signaling in several

cells that could be a direct or indirect result from enhanced RALB
signaling warrants further investigation. YAP, a mediator of the
Hippo signaling pathway that has been shown to mediate
resistance to inhibition of MAPK signaling and promote Kras
oncogene independence in oncogenic pancreatic cancer,24,25 was
enriched in relapsed NRI AMLs. Overall, the broad deregulation of
signaling and gene transcription observed provides a foundation
for the ongoing rational development of targeted treatment
approaches designed to mitigate or prevent relapse after Ras
targeted treatment strategies.
This work provides important insight into the mechanisms of
response and resistance to targeted cancer treatment approaches
in general, and particularly for renewed efforts to therapeutically
target Ras signaling.41 Furthermore, our results support further
characterization of RALB signaling as a key mediator of survival
and NRAS-independent relapse in AML and as a valid therapeutic
target.

models.38,46 A large-scale synthetic lethal RNAi screen uncovered a
critical role for TBK1 in KRAS-driven transformation of epithelial
cells through activation of nuclear factor-κB antiapoptotic signals
involving REL and BCL-xL.38 We found that upregulation of Cdk5
and Rgl2, activators of RALB signaling,34,35 as well as increased
Ralb expression was associated with NRI activation of RALB-TBK1
signaling in relapsed AMLs. Activation of RALB signaling and
upregulation of components of the nuclear factor-κB transcriptional complex were accompanied by an altered balance of
pro- and antiapoptotic mediators, consistent with previous reports
suggesting that nuclear factor-κB signaling downstream of RALB
supports cancer cell survival.38,45 We have previously shown that
RALB enhances expression of BCL2 in AML, providing a potential
mechanism by which RALB drives NRI AML relapse.37 Consistent
with this, BCL2 family inhibitors to suppressed the clonogenic
potential of relapsed NRI AML cells; however, the precise
mechanisms that promote AML cell survival downstream of RALB
remain to be elucidated.
While targeting RALB activation with dinaciclib demonstrated
potent RALB-dependent antileukemic effects on AML cells, we
cannot exclude the contribution of RALB-independent effects. It is
possible that dinaciclib-mediated inhibition of CDK1, another
protein that was enriched in relapse NRI AMLs, or CDK9, an
alternate survival pathway for MLL-rearranged AMLs,47 contributes
to the antileukemic activity of dinaciclib. In fact, drugs that target
multiple pathways may reduce the ability of AML cells to coopt
alternate resistance pathways. Our ﬁndings support the further
investigation of the critical targets of dinaciclib in AML. New small
molecules that directly inhibit Ral function may provide additional
tools to study the role and therapeutic potential of RALB signaling
in AML as they become available.48
Our data also identiﬁed several other potential mechanisms that
may bypass RAS oncogene dependence of AML cells. The altered
balance of pro- and antiapoptotic mediators in relapsed NRI AML

All mouse studies were approved by the University of Minnesota
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Roughly equal number of
male and female mice were used for all experiments and evenly allocated
to experimental groups without systematic randomization or blinding.
Group sizes were determined based on the number of mice required for
80% power to detect a difference in the mean AML burden of at least 1.5 s.d.
between experimental and control groups with Po0.05 using a t-test.
For leukemic cell transplantation, 2 × 106 tNM AML cells, 4 × 106 THP1luciferase AML cells or 2 × 106 patient-derived AML cells were injected via
tail vein into 6–10-week-old recipient mice. Severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID) beige (Charles River, Burlington, MA, USA) mice did not
receive any preconditioning before murine AML transplantation. NRG or
NRGS (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) mice received 375 cGy from an
X-ray source 24 h before human AML transplantation. Peripheral blood was
obtained by retro-orbital blood sampling and leukocyte counts were
monitored using a Hemavet 950 (Drew Scientiﬁc, Miami Lakes, FL, USA).
THP1-luciferase mice were monitored using an IVIS 100 Imaging System
(Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). PDX mice were monitored by ﬂow
cytometry of peripheral blood stained for human CD45 and human CD33.
Doxycycline-treated mice were given 4 mg intraperitoneally doxycycline
(Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) followed by 5 mg/ml in their water.

Inhibitors
Dinaciclib, ABT-737 and ABT-199 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals
(Houston, TX, USA) and reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). For
in vitro studies inhibitors were diluted in the growth medium. For in vivo
studies dinaciclib was diluted in 20% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and
administered intraperitoneally.

Leukemia colony-forming cell assay
NRD and NRI AML cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Lonza, Basel,
Switzerland) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins,
CO, USA) with or without 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h or
inhibitors for 24 h and then plated in IMDM (Lonza) with 30% fetal bovine
serum, 1.275% methylcellulose (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and
2 ng/ml murine GM-CSF (R&D Systems). Human AML cells were treated
with inhibitors for 24 h and then plated in MethoCult H4034 (Stem Cell
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Colonies were scored after 7–14 days
on an inverted microscope.

Western blotting and RALB-GTP assay
Protein lysates were run on 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels
and transferred to a PVDF using the NuPAGE and iBlot Systems (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RALB-GTP levels were determined using
the RALB Activation Assay Kit (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Blots were
blocked and stained according to antibody manufacturer’s recommendations. Blots were developed using the SuperSignal West Pico ECL (Thermo
Fisher, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or Advansta Quantum ECL Kit (Advansta,

nitrogen and sent to the MD Anderson RPPA Core Facility for analysis.
Brieﬂy, protein lysates were serially diluted and arrayed on nitrocellulosecoated slides using an Aushon 2470 Arrayer (Aushon BioSystems, Billerica,
MA, USA). The slides were scanned, analyzed and quantiﬁed using ArrayPro Analyzer (Tecan Group Ltd, Männedorf, Switzerland). Protein concentrations were normalized by median polish, which was corrected across
samples by the linear expression values using the median expression levels
of all antibody experiments to calculate a loading correction factor for each
sample. Normalized protein values were used to evaluate differential target
levels between NRD and NRI samples using a Benjamini–Hochbergcorrected q-value of ⩽ 0.05.

Cell culture and primary AML samples
Cell lines were originally obtained from ATCC or DSMZ, maintained under
standard cell culture conditions, tested monthly for mycoplasma
contamination and authenticated by STR analysis at the University of
Arizona Genomics Core. De-identiﬁed mobilized peripheral blood and AML
patient samples were obtained after informed consent according to
protocols approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review
Board. Primary AML samples were cultured in IMDM (Thermo Fisher)
