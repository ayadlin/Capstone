ABSTRACT
Genotoxic stress inflicted by anti-cancer drugs causes DNA breaks and genome
instability. DNA double strand breaks induced by irradiation or pharmacological inhibition
of Topoisomerase II activate ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) kinase signalling
pathway that in turn triggers cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. ATM-dependent gammaphosphorylation of histone H2Ax and other histone modifications, including ubiquitnylation,
promote exchange of histones and recruitment of DNA damage response (DDR) and repair
proteins. Signal transduction pathways, besides DDR itself, also control expression of
genes whose products cause cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis thus ultimately affecting
the sensitivity of cells to genotoxic stress. In this study, using a number of experimental
approaches we provide evidence that lysine-specific methyltransferase (KMT) Set7/9
affects DDR and DNA repair, at least in part, by regulating the expression of an E3
ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2. Furthermore, we show that Set7/9 physically interacts with
Mdm2. Several cancer cell lines with inverse expression of Set7/9 and Mdm2 displayed
diminished survival in response to genotoxic stress. These findings are signified by our
bioinformatics studies suggesting that the unleashed expression of Mdm2 in cancer
patients with diminished expression of Set7/9 is associated with poor survival outcome.

The signal transduction cascade triggered by these kinases
is transmitted further to several other kinases, including
Chek1 and Chek2, which, in turn phosphorylate dozens
of proteins that coordinate cell cycle checkpoints and the
assembly and functioning of DNA repair mechanisms [4].
One of the hallmarks of DNA damage response (DDR)
is the formation of γ-H2Ax foci caused by histone H2Ax
phosphorylation by ATM/DNA-PK on serine 139 [5]. These
modified histones spread in both directions on the distance
of megabases from the site of damage and therefore can
be easily visualised by microscopy [6]. Propagation of the
γ-H2Ax foci depends on the recruitment of DDR factors
like MDC1 and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex,
which can then in turn recruit and activate additional ATM
molecules, leading to an amplification of the initial signal [7].
In addition to phosphorylation of histones, DNA
damage also elicits multiple chromatin post-translational
modifications (PTMs) including acetylation, ubiqui­tinylation

INTRODUCTION
DNA damage is one of the most dangerous forms
of cellular stress. Genotoxic stress may be caused by
both extrinsic and intrinsic factors, such as gamma- and
UV-irradiation, DNA replication stress, reactive oxygen
species and others. Among those double-strand breaks
are considered to be the most deleterious to cells. Even a
single unrepaired break can cause genomic instability and
tumorigenesis [1]. There are two major pathways of DNA
repair dealing with this type of lesions: non-homologous
end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination
(HR) [2]. These two mechanisms are initiated by several
members of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase family (PI3)
members exerted by different protein complexes. The
first two (ATM and DNA-PK) are activated in response to
double-strand breaks (DSB), whereas ATR is activated in
response to stalled replication and transcription forks [3].

and lysine methylation [8]. For example, acetylation of
Lys5 (K5) in γ-H2Ax and multiple lysines in histone H4 by
Tip60 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) in response to DDR
increases the mobility and dynamics of chromatin, thereby
facilitating the clearance of damaged DNA from histones
and providing an access of DNA repair enzymes to the sites
of damage [9]. Importantly, Tip60 loading onto chromatin
occurs in histone H3-K9 methylation (H3-K9me) dependent
manner [10, 11]. The latter modification is mediated partly by
KMT Suv39 h1, which in turn is regulated by another KMT,
Set7/9 [12]. Another lysine-specific covalent modification
that competes with acetylation is ubiquitinylation. RNF8/
RNF168-dependent ubiquitinylation of histone γH2AX
and H2B promotes DDR by augmenting the recruitment
of 53BP1 to the sites of DNA damage [13–15]. In response
to DNA damage histones also undergo lysine methylation,
which is important for recruitment of the DDR proteins.
For example, lysine methyltransferase (KMT) MMSET
methylates histone H4 on K20 (H4-K20) to recruit 53BP1 via
its Tudor domain, which specifically recognises methylated
lysines [16]. Furthermore, SET8 (PR-SET7) and Suv4-20 h1/
h2 also mono- and di-methylate H4-K20 and are found at the
sites of DNA damage leading to transient deacetylation of
histones [17].
Set7/9 was initially identified as KMT that
specifically deposited mono-methyl mark on lysine 4 of
histone H3 (H3-K4me1) in vitro [18, 19]. However, we
and others showed that the recombinant Set7/9 failed to
methylate histones as part of nucleosomes [20–22]. This
suggests that Set7/9 either methylates free histones or
modifies chromatin modifiers thereby indirectly affecting
chromatin remodelling. In line with notion, SET7/9 was
shown to methylate a number of transcription factors,
including TAF10 [23], estrogen receptor α (ERα) [24],
RelA [25], PCAF [26], Stat3 [27], Yap [28], Suv39 h1
[12], AR [29, 30], p53 [31] and E2F1 [32].
Importantly, the two targets of SET7/9-mediated
methylation, E2F1 and p53, are the critical regulators of
not only cell cycle progression and apoptosis, but also
participate in DDR [33–35]. E2F1 controls transcription
of the CCNE gene, whose product, cyclin E, forms a
complex with cdk2 to promote DNA replication [36].
On the contrary, p53 regulates transcription of p21/Cip
gene, whose product blunts the activity of cdk2/cyclinE
complex and hence, causes cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase.
Upon DNA damage, both p53 and E2F1 are stabilised and
activated by phosphorylation and acetylation mediated
by Tip60, p300/CBP and PCAF [37, 38]. Subsequently,
both p53 and E2F1 participate in DNA damage-induced
apoptosis: p53 activates transcription of Bax, Puma,
Noxa and several other pro-apoptotic genes, whereas
E2F1 switches from activation of cell cycle genes to proapoptotic TP73 gene [38–40]. Furthermore, both p53
and E2F1 when phosphorylated by ATM can be found at
DNA damage foci, suggesting that they can physically
recruit DNA repair proteins [41, 42]. One of the critical
regulators for both p53 and E2F1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Mdm2. Interestingly, while Mdm2 attenuates the activity
of p53 by targeting it for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal
degradation, the transcriptional activity of E2F1 is blunted
by Mdm2 without triggering its degradation [38, 43].
Our recent findings highlighted an important role
of Set7/9 in DDR. On the one hand, Set7/9 is required
for activation of p53 in response to genotoxic stress [44],
but on the other hand, the lack of Set7/9 promotes E2F1dependent transcription of another tumor suppressor,
TP73 [38] [45]. These results prompted us to investigate
the role of Set7/9 in DNA damage response more closely.
In the present study we report that SET7/9 is involved
in DDR via additional mechanism that involves Mdm2.
Specifically, by using various approaches we demonstrate
that forced attenuation of SET7/9 expression is associated
with increased DNA damage sensitivity, which, at least
partly, is mediated through the regulation of Mdm2
expression.

RESULTS
Down-regulation of Set7/9 augments sensitivity
to genotoxic stress by doxorubicin
Both p53 and E2F1 transcription factors are
activated and stabilised upon DNA damage and
regulate DDR by eliciting cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis, respectively [33, 38]. Our previous studies
have uncovered the role of Set7/9 as an important
transcriptional co-regulator for p53 and E2F1 [32, 38,
44, 46, 47]. Based on these findings, we decided to
investigate a potential role of Set7/9 in DDR. To this end,
we have established a cell line with inducible expression
of shRNA against Set7/9 (Set7/9 Knock Down) based on
U2-OS (Figure 1A and [45]). Upon induction of shRNA
against Set7/9 with doxycycline for three days the level of
Set7/9 expression fell down more than five-fold as judged
by western blotting.
Upon DNA damage Set7/9KD cells showed
attenuated expression of p53 and cyclin E, which is in a
good agreement with previously published data [20, 45].
Next, we examined U2-OS Set7/9KD cells along with
the parental cells expressing non-specific shRNA for
their ability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
response to genotoxic stress elicited by doxorubicin by
FACs (Figure 1B). Due to the over-expression of PP4
phosphatase U2-OS cells elicit G2/M arrest despite the
presence of wild-type p53 [48] (Figure 1B). In response to
doxorubicin Set7/9KD cells exhibited a more pronounced
arrest in G1 and S phases compared to the parental
cells. This is due to the compromised E2F1-dependent
transcription of the cyclin E gene in these cells [45].
Remarkably, Set7/9KD cells were also more susceptible
to apoptosis compared to the control cells (Figure 1B,
compare sub-G1 fractions). Taken these results together it
was prudent to speculate that the attenuation of Set7/9 may
cause DNA damage sensitivity.

cells stably expressing control or Set7/9-specific shRNA were treated with 0.5 μM of Doxorubicin for the indicated periods of time
and were subsequently analysed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies. B. The same cell lines were treated with doxorubicin
for the indicated periods of time. The resulting cells were fixed, stained with propidium iodide and analysed for cell cycle distribution.
C. Clonogenic survival assay of U2-OS control and Set7/9KD cells treated with different concentrations of doxorubicin or MNNG. The
numbers of colonies formed in each case are shown in the table below. D. U2-OS cells expressing control (Set9+) or Set7/9-specific
shRNA (Set9–) were treated with the indicated amounts of doxorubicin for 16, 24 and 48 hours. At each time point the number of cells was
determined for both cell lines using an automated microscopy system.

We directly explored this possibility using the
clonogenic survival assay in which we compared the
survival rates of U2-OS Set7/9KD cells with the ones of
the parental cells after treatment with different genotoxic
compounds (Figure 1C). Prior to this, we examined
a range of different concentrations of doxorubicin to
establish the efficient dosage of drug to induce cytotoxicity
for both cell types (Figure 1D). Low doses of doxorubicin
(0.04 and 0.02 μM) did not dramatically affect the growth
of both types of cells despite the division time for U2OS Set7/9KD cells was slightly longer than that of the
wild type (Supplementary Figure S1). Since only at 0.1
μM of doxorubicin Set7/9KD and control cells began to
show differential sensitivity, we decided to test 0.2 μM
concentration of this drug in the clonogenic assay. We also
tested the effect of methylnitronitrosoguanidine (MNNG),
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

an alkylating agent that induces DNA mismatch repair
[49]. Although Set7/9KD cells showed 1.5 fold increased
susceptibility to 4 uM concentration of MNNG compared
to the control cells, the effect was not as dramatic as in
the case of doxorubicin treatment. At the concentration of
0.2 uM of doxorubicin Set7/9KD cells gave 5.5 times less
colonies than the wild-type ones (Figure 1C, bottom row
of the table). This result strongly suggests that Set7/9KD
cells are prone to DNA damage induced by doxorubicin.

Set7/9 knockdown impairs DNA damage
response and DNA repair
The hallmark of DNA damage response in eukaryotic
cells is the formation of γ-H2Ax foci. These foci spread
on a long distance from the initial site of damage and

manifest the activation of ATM/ATR kinases that in turn
phosphorylate serine 139 of histone H2Ax [50]. Accordingly,
we first assessed levels of γ-H2Ax staining in both U2-OS
control and Set7/9KD cells after sustained treatment with
doxorubicin (Figure 2A). We found that the level of γ-H2Ax
staining in Set7/9KD cells was higher than in the parental
cells, especially at early time points (Figure 2A, upper panel).
Another well-known marker of DNA damage is Rad51
[51]. Again, the western blot signal of Rad51 was higher
in Set7/9KD cells versus control cells (Figure 2A, middle
panel), suggesting that DDR is higher in Set7/9KD cells.
The amount of DNA damage is characterized by
the number of γ-H2Ax foci and their intensity. To directly
assess the effect of doxorubicin treatment on the intensity
of γ-H2Ax foci in Set7/9KD and wild-type U2-OS cells
we used an automated microscopy “Operetta” to count
the intensities of γ-H2Ax foci per nucleus (Figure 2B).
Importantly, the level of γ-H2Ax staining obtained by
indirect immunofluorescence was also higher in Set7/9KD
cells compared to wild-type U2-OS cells.

Because increased sensitivity of Set7/9KD cells to
doxorubicin-induced genotoxic stress may be caused by
various mechanisms, including the attenuation of ABC
transporter activity that controls intracellular levels of
the drug [52], we decided to measure directly the levels
of DNA repair in U2-OS control and Set7/9KD cells
after exposure to 5 Grey of γ-irradiation (Figure 2C). A
representative picture of the Comet assay is shown (Figure
2C). As evident from the results of this experiment,
consistent with high level of γ-H2Ax staining, more unrepaired DNA remains in Set7/9KD cells in comparison
to the control cells.
Doxorubicin is an inhibitor of Topoisomerase II that
causes double strand breaks in the DNA. It is known that
the double strand DNA breaks repair is largely mediated
by two mechanisms: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)
and homologous recombination (HR) [2]. Thus, we
sought to determine which mechanism of DNA repair was
compromised in U2-OS Set7/9KD cells. To address this
question we used a previously described GFP reporter-based

specific shRNA (Set9–) were treated with doxorubicin for the indicated periods of time. Cell extracts for each time point were analyzed by western
blotting for expression of γ-H2Ax and Rad51. Coomassie staining (loading) was used for normalization. B. U2-OS cells expressing control
(Set9+) or Set7/9-specific shRNA (Set9–) were treated with doxorubicin for the indicated periods of time. At each time point the number and
intensity of γ-H2Ax foci normalised to the number of cells in the well was determined for both cell lines using an automated microscopy system.
Statistical analysis is done by two-way ANOVA. C. A representative experiment of the Comet assay in denaturing conditions on U2-OS control or

system for measuring the efficiency of both types of DNA
repair inside cells [53] (Figure 2D). In brief, this system
allows monitoring the efficiency of repair of the GFP gene
digested with restriction enzymes. The GFP reporter before
being repaired by either NHEJ or HR mechanism is inert
because of the presence of an inactivating mutation or
insertion in the GFP gene, which is subsequently eliminated
upon successful repair [53]. As evident from the results
shown in Figure 2D both NHEJ and HR repair mechanisms
were attenuated in Set7/9KD cells compared to the parental
cells. Collectively, these results suggest that the attenuation
of Set7/9 expression sensitised cells to DNA damage by
affecting both NHEJ and HR DNA repair mechanisms.

harvested at different time points (Supplementary Figure S2
and data not shown). Since Set7/9 was shown to co-regulate
transcription mediated by p53, E2F1, and AR we primarily
focused on the known targets of these transcription factors.
Another criterion of selection for genes to be studied
further was the involvement of their products (directly or
indirectly) in DDR and DNA repair. Applying these criteria
to the targets of Set7/9 yielded us a gene list shown in
Supplementary Figure S2A. Importantly, among these genes
was Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Furthermore, Mdm2 is
a known target of p53 and the regulator of E2F1 activity,
suggesting that Set7/9-dependent DNA damage sensitivity
may be mediated by the Mdm2 axis [54].
Next, we validated the results of microarray gene
expression experiment by performing (Q)RT-PCR on the
Mdm2 gene in U2-OS control and Set7/9KD cells since
it has been shown to interact with several well-known
regulators of DDR, including NBS1 [55, 56]. Results of
(Q)RT-PCR confirmed that Mdm2 was up-regulated in
Set7/9KD cells compared to the control cells after DNA
damage (Figure 3A). Interestingly, maximal difference in

Attenuation of Set7/9 expression increases
cellular levels of Mdm2 upon genotoxic stress
To gain insights into molecular mechanisms of DNA
damage sensitivity of Set7/9KD cells we performed a
genome-wide gene expression analysis of U2-OS and U2-OS
Set7/9KD cells before and after treatment with doxorubicin

the levels of Mdm2 gene expression between Set7/9KD
and control cells was observed at 24 hrs after DNA
damage (Figure 3A). Importantly, the difference in the
levels of Mdm2 expression was also confirmed by western
blotting (Figure 3B). Since Mdm2 has been shown to
participate in the regulation of DDR by physical binding
with several chromatin-associated factors, including
E2F1, PCAF, Tip60 and NBS1 [56], we probed whether
Mdm2 also physically associated with Set7/9. To address
this, several GST-fusions of truncated Mdm2 mutants
(shown in Figure 3C, upper panel) were incubated with
cell extracts that contained Set7/9 (Figure 3D). Results
of western blotting analysis showed that Set7/9 bound
avidly only with the full-length version of Mdm2.
However, a much weaker binding was also detected
between the Set7/9 protein and the 61-491 fragment of
Mdm2. Importantly, protein expression levels of all the
Mdm2 mutants were comparable (Figure 3D, upper and
lower panels). Apparently, Set7/9 binds both the aminoand carboxyl-termini of Mdm2. Taken these results, we
concluded that Set7/9 likely modulates cellular sensitivity
to genotoxic stress, at least in part, via Mdm2.

with MG132 decreased the difference in γ-H2Ax signals
between H1299 control and Set7/9 KD cells. This result
argues that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 is
important for DDR, although this observation requires
additional investigation.

Attenuated expression of Set7/9 is associated
with higher sensitivity to genotoxic stress in
lung cancer cell lines
We next decided to investigate whether the role of
Set7/9 in activation of DDR and cellular cytotoxicity is
cell type-dependent. To address this question, we chose
two lung cancer cell lines that differentially express
Set7/9: H522 cells contain high levels of Set7/9, whereas
H1650 cells contain low levels of Set7/9 (Figure 5A,
upper panel). Importantly, western blot analysis revealed
that H1650 cells expressed higher amounts of Mdm2
compared to H522 cells irrespective of doxorubicin
treatment (Figure 5A, middle panel), which is consistent
with our results on U2-OS cells that Set7/9 inversely
correlates with Mdm2. To assess the role of Set7/9 in
DDR, we examined the ability of H522 and H1650 cells
to proliferate in response to sustained treatment with
doxorubicin. (Figure 5B, 5C). We reasoned that if Set7/9
plays role in DNA damage sensitivity, then H1650 cells
should be more prone to doxorubicin compared to H522
as the former express lower levels of Set7/9. Thus, both
cell types were continuously treated with increasing
amounts of doxorubicin and their growth was monitored
by automatic microscopy at 16, 24 and 48 hours (Figure
5B, 5C). To determine the rate of proliferation we
arbitrary set the number of cells at 16 h time point as
1 and then plotted the ratios of numbers of cells at 24
and 48 h time points treated with various concentrations
of doxorubicin (Figure 5B, 5C). H522 cells (high
expression of Set7/9 and low expression of Mdm2)
treated with low concentrations of doxorubicin were able
to proliferate (Figure 5B,compare the ratios at 24 and 48
hrs at 0.02 μM of doxorubicin). On the contrary, H1650
cells (low expression of Set7/9 and high expression of
Mdm2) were extremely sensitive to doxorubicin, as
they displayed decreasing ratios of proliferation even
at 0.02 μM of doxorubicin (Figure 5C). At higher dose
of sustained doxorubicin treatment (0.5 μM) both cell
lines showed decreased ratios of proliferation, yet at
48 hours the proliferation ratio was two-fold lower for
H1650 cells compared to H522 (compare Figure 5B and
5C, 0.5 μM dose). In support of our hypothesis, H522
cells that express elevated levels of Set7/9 were tolerant
even to 0.1 μM dose of doxorubicin, while H1650 cells at
this dose underwent cell cycle arrest (Figure 5B and 5C,
respectively and data not shown). Thus, we concluded
that the correlation between levels of Set7/9 expression
and DNA damage resistance does not depend on cell type
and may be an important prognostic marker.

Mdm2 affects levels of γ-H2Ax upon
genotoxic stress
To further investigate the role of Mdm2 in Set7/9mediated DDR, we down-regulated the expression of
Mdm2 by specific si-RNA in U2-OS control and Set7/9
KD cells and compared those for the intensity of γ-H2Ax
staining after DNA damage induced by doxorubicin
(Figure 4A). While there was a minimal difference in
γ-H2Ax signals between the control and Mdm2 siRNA
samples in the absence of DNA damage, a significant
increase in γ-H2Ax staining was detected in U2-OS
Set7/9 KD cells versus the control ones after doxorubicin
treatment (Figure 4A). Importantly, down-regulation of
Mdm2 expression by siRNA in these samples (Figure 4B)
negated the difference in γ-H2Ax staining, confirming our
hypothesis that Set7/9 operates in DDR, at least in part,
via Mdm2.
Next, we asked the question of whether the E3
ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 is important for DDR
in Set7/9 KD cells. To address this question we decided
to block with MG132 the functional effect of Mdm2
ubiquitinylation activity, i.e. proteasome-mediated degra­
dation of ubiquitinylated proteins [57], and compare the
γ-H2Ax signals in MG132-treated and non-treated cells
(Figure 4C). To eliminate potential effect of p53 on DNA
repair, we used p53-negative lung carcinoma cells, H1299,
where the expression of Set7/9 was stably knocked down
(Figure 4D). In agreement with our previous results,
attenuation of Set7/9 expression in H1299 cells upon
sustained treatment with doxorubicin resulted in elevated
γ-H2Ax staining compared to Set7/9 control cells
(Figure 4C and 4D, middle panel). Notably, the treatment

to SDS-PAGE, followed by western blotting with Set7/9 and γ-H2Ax antibodies. Histone H3 signal was used for normalization.

Inverse expression of Set7/9 and Mdm2 correlates
with better survival of breast cancer patients

patients into two cohorts. The first one was enriched with
positive correlation between the levels of Set7/9 and Mdm2
expression, while all the other patients formed the second
cohort (Figure 6C and 6D). To identify statistical differences
in survival outcome between the two groups of patients, the
R statistical package was used to perform statistical tests
and to derive the P-value (for the full description of the
procedure see [60]). Importantly, we found that the cohort of
patients with strong negative correlation between Set7/9 and
Mdm2 (-0.53) showed better survival outcome compared
with the cohort where Set7/9 and Mdm2 exhibited strong
positive correlation (0.59) (Figure 6E). Similar correlation
we detected in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting that this observation
is not unique to specific type of cancer.
Moreover, we attempted to assess the effect of p53
status on the negative correlation between Set7/9 and Mdm2
expression in breast cancer patients using the METABRIC
database [61] (Supplementary Figure S4). To this end, we
compared correlation signals between Set7/9 and Mdm2
in two cohorts of patients: with wild type p53 and mutant

To assess the biological significance of our findings,
we decided to utilize a bioinformatics approach. Our results
suggested that down-regulation of Set7/9 in osteosarcoma
U2-OS cells led to defects in DNA repair and hence,
enhanced apoptosis (Figure 2D). Since Set7/9KD cells
exhibit elevated levels of Mdm2 expression, we questioned
whether the product of this gene may negatively affect
DNA repair and thus affect the survival of cancer patients.
Using the expression data available for breast cancer
patients and the algorithm described in [58, 59] we found
that high expression of Set7/9 (SetD7) correlated with
better survival (Figure 6A). On the contrary, up-regulation
of the Mdm2 gene correlated with poor survival outcomes

Next, we thought to determine whether a correlation
between the expression profiles of Set7/0 and Mdm2 may
affect the survival of cancer patients. To achieve this goal
we implemented a statistical procedure, which divided the

or no p53 expression (Supplementary Figure S4). Also,
we performed the same procedure for two other Set7/9
target genes, HDAC2 and XRCC5 (Supplementary Figure
S2A, S2B). Interestingly, the negative correlation between
Set7/9 and Mdm2 (–0.17) was detected only in the samples
with mutated p53, whereas the correlation for this pair in
the samples with wild-type p53 was insignificant (–0.01)
(Supplementary Figure S4). However, no statistically
significant effect of p53 was observed on correlations between
Set7/9 and HDAC2 or XRCC5 (Supplementary Figure S4).
Collectively, these results argue that Set7/9 participates in
DDR by regulating expression of a number of genes, from
which only a portion are transcriptional targets of p53.

caused by defects in both mechanisms of double strand
breaks repair, NHEJ and HR (Figure 2D). Sensitivity of
Set7/9KD cells to sustained exposure to genotoxic drugs
was accompanied by an increased formation of γ-H2Ax
foci, which manifests DDR (Figure 2A, 2B). Microarray
gene expression analysis of Set7/9KD and wild-type
cells revealed that Set7/9 attenuation resulted in altered
expression of a number of genes involved in DNA damage
signalling and repair, cell cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis.
(Supplementary Figure S2A, S2B). Importantly, the level
of p53 expression itself was attenuated in Set7/9KD cells
consistent with our previously published results.
One of the principal regulators of p53 activity and
stability in the cell is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2. The
latter is the target of p53 activity itself. Surprisingly, our
results suggest that the lack of Set7/9 increases the level of
Mdm2 expression (Figure 3A, 3B), despite the attenuation
of p53 levels.
To circumvent this discrepancy, we hypothesize
that the elevated expression of Mdm2 in Set7/9KD cells

DISCUSSION
In this study we uncovered a novel function of KMT
Set7/9 in DDR. Abrogation of Set7/9 expression in U2-OS
cells induced their sensitivity to genotoxic stress elicited
by anti-cancer drugs (Figure 1C, 1D). This sensitivity was

depends on other transcriptional factors, e. g. TAp73, which
can often substitute p53. Noteworthy, the level of TAp73
expression is elevated in Set7/9KD cells upon DNA damage
[45]. Alternatively, the lack of Set7/9 may down-regulate
Mdm2-targeting micro-RNAs thus resulting in stabilization
of the Mdm2 RNA message. Consequently, Mdm2 interferes
with DNA repair by sequestering NBS1 from sites of DNA
damage [55, 62]. The functional significance of Mdm2 in
DDR is also signified by the fact that down-regulation of
the Mdm2 level by siRNA, or its activity by MG132, led to
attenuation of the γ-H2Ax staining in Set7/9KD cells upon
sustained doxorubicin treatment (Figure 4A, 4C).
It is also important to note that Set7/9 was found to
physically interact with Mdm2 (Figure 3D). Apparently,
this interaction is complex, as both the amino- and
carboxyl termini of Mdm2 are required for the interaction
with Set7/9. We assume that in the cells where Set7/9 is
expressed at high levels, the latter is able to neutralize the
negative effect of Mdm2 on DNA repair.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Alternatively, Set7/9 as an important transcriptional
coactivator of several transcription factors may affect
DDR via regulation of other genes, besides Mdm2,
including long non-coding and micro-RNAs [59, 63, 64].
In this respect, it would be interesting to determine the list
of micro-RNAs affected by Set7/9 and whether their gene
targets are involved in DDR. This work is under its way.
From the cancer therapy point of view it is important
to note that lung carcinoma cell lines H522 and H1650
that differ in the levels of Set7/9 expression also displayed
differential sensitivity to genotoxic stress induced by
doxorubicin. These data argue that negative correlation
between Set7/9 and Mdm2 expression levels may be an
important prognostic marker of tumour sensitivity to
genotoxic therapies. Our bioinformatics data on breast
cancer patients support this notion.
Undoubtedly, more experimental work is required
to ascertain the role of Set7/9 in the process of DDR and
its effect on cellular cytotoxicity in response to genotoxic

pre-coated slide. Lysis was performed overnight in
alkaline conditions as described [66]. Next day slides
were rinsed, subjected to electrophoresis, stained
with 2.5 mg/ml of propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich),
and analysed by CometScore 1.5 software. Two
hundred cells were manually inspected in each case.
Experiments were repeated at least three times showing
the same trend.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines manipulations
All cells used in this study were purchased
from ATCC, if not stated otherwise. Human lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines H522 and H1650 were
propagated in RPMI medium (Gibco) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco). Human
osteosarcoma cell line U2-OS and its derivatives were
maintained in DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco). Cells were
grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.
U2-OS cells with Tet-inducible expression of shRNA
against Set7/9 and the reference cell line were generated as
described in [45]. To manipulate with the expression level
of Mdm2 specific siRNA (siRNA-Mdm2) as well as the
control one (c-siRNA) were purchased from Ambion Life
Technology (Cat#4390824, ID S8630). Typically, 50nM of
c-siRNA or siRNA-MDM2 were used for transfection with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Life technologies, USA) in OptiMEM (Gibco, USA). Following two days of incubation
to achieve knockdown of Mdm2 expression, cells were
treated with doxorubicin as described.

DNA repair analysis using reporter constructs
for NHEJ and HR
Plasmids carrying NHEJ or HR reporter cassettes
containing a GFP gene, as described [53], were
linearized by I-SceI (NEB) and used for transfecting
cells: 0.5 μg and 2 μg respectively. 0.1 μg of pmCherry
vector (Clontech) was co-transfected in both cases
as a transfection efficiency control. Transfections
were performed using TurboFect transfection reagent
(Fermentas). 48 hrs later cells were harvested and
analysed by 2-laser FACS.

RNA isolation and relative quantification RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells
using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For relative quantification
RT-PCR analysis of Tip60, MDM2, and GAPDH mRNA,
1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with
oligo d(T) using RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). cDNA were amplified
by real-time PCR on an RotorGene 6000 PCR machine
(Qiagene) using SYBR green mix (BioLine). All reactions
were run in triplicate. Data were analysed by RotorGene
6000 Series Software. Relative amounts of Tip60 and
MDM2 mRNAs were normalized to GAPDH mRNA.
Expression of these genes was analysed by RT-PCR using
the following primers: (Tip60) F-ttttccccagaatggagccg,
R-gtggtgctgacggtattcca; (MDM2) F- tgggcagcttgaagcagttg,
R-caggctgccatgtgacctaaga; (GAPDH) F-gggaag gtgaagg
tcggagt, R-ttgaggtcaatgaaggggtca.

Cell cycle analysis
For the cell cycle analysis cells were harvested,
washed once with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight
at −20°C. Staining for DNA content was performed with
50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μg/ml
RNase A for 30 min. Analysis was performed on a FACS
Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with Cell Quest
Pro software. Cell cycle modelling was performed with
Modfit 3.0 software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME).

Clonogenic assay

Microarray gene expression analysis

Cells were seeded in amount of 5 × 103 per well
and 16 hrs later were treated with 4 and 10 μM MNNG
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hr in OPTI-MEM or 0.2, 1, or
2 μM doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hrs in DMEM.
After treatment cells were washed with PBS and grown
in DMEM for 2 weeks. After that time cells were fixed
with 10% formalin (Sigma-Aldrich), stained with Giemsa
as described [65], and colonies were counted.

Microarray gene expression analysis was perfo­
rmed using Human Gene Expression 4x44K Microarray
Kit and Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Quality of RNA was tested by 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). 100 ng of each
RNA sample were used for cRNA synthesis and were
simultaneously labelled with Cy-3. After purification
1.65 ng of each cRNA sample were hybridised with
oligonucleotide probes on microarray slides for 17 hrs.
Next day slides were washed and scanned. Data were
analysed by GeneSpring GX11.5 software.

The γ-H2Ax intensity levels in U2-OS, H1299
and matching cell lines with knockdown of Set7/9 as
well as in H522 and H1650 cell were estimated using
automated microscopy (Operetta, Perkin Elmer) at 40X
magnification. Typically, for the automated microscopy
analysis cell lines were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized
with 0, 5% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-γ-H2AX
antibodies at 1:500 dilution. To visualize nuclei, cells were
stained with Hoechst (3 μg/ml) and were subsequently
analysed in the Hoechst channel with exposition time
50  ms; γ-H2Ax foci were analysed in the Alexa 488
channel with exposition time 200 ms. The intensity levels
of γ-H2Ax foci were calculated using the following spots
parameters: radius < or = 0.95 μm, distance between foci
> or = 0.74 μm. Total intensity of γ-H2Ax in foci was
normalised to the number of cells in the well.
