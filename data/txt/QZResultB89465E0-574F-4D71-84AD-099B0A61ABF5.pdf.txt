Abstract
Folate receptors (FR) may be of use for targeted delivery of cytotoxic drugs in invasive urothelial carcinoma
(iUC), for which improved therapy is needed. FR expression and function in iUC were explored and the antitumor
activity and toxicity of a folate-targeted vinblastine conjugate were evaluated in dogs with naturally occurring
iUC, an excellent model for human iUC. FR immunohistochemistry was carried out on iUC and normal human
and dog bladder tissues together with nuclear scintigraphy in dogs to monitor iUC folate uptake. Dose escalation
of a folate-targeted vinblastine compound, EC0905, was conducted in dogs with biopsy-conﬁrmed, FR-positive
iUC. FRs were detected by immunohistochemistry (PU17) in most primary iUC and many nodal and lung
metastases from dogs, and scintigraphy conﬁrmed folate uptake in both primary and metastatic lesions. The
maximum tolerated dose of EC0905 in dogs was 0.25 mg/kg IV weekly, with neutropenia at higher doses. Tumor
responses included partial remission (50% reduction in tumor volume) in ﬁve dogs and stable disease (<50%
change in tumor volume) in four dogs. Immunoreactivity to PU17 was similar in humans (78% of primary iUC, 80%
of nodal metastases). Less immunoreactivity to mab343 (22% of cases) occurred. FR-b was noted in 21% of human
iUC cases. Our ﬁndings suggest folate-targeted therapy holds considerable promise for treating iUC, where FR-b
may be important in addition to FR-a. Cancer Res; 73(2); 875–84. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Invasive urinary bladder cancer (invasive urothelial carcinoma, iUC) that has metastasized causes more than 14,000
deaths each year in the United States (1, 2). Nonspeciﬁc
cytotoxic drugs used to treat iUC have failed to eradicate the
cancer, and have caused substantial toxicity in many patients
(2, 3). Targeted therapy for iUC may offer the opportunity to
increase treatment efﬁcacy and reduce toxicity.
An emerging approach to direct drugs to cancer cells while
limiting damage to normal cells has been to exploit folic acid
(folate, vitamin B9) uptake in cancer cells (4, 5). Folate receptor
(FR) expression in normal tissues is limited, while upregulation
of FRs has been noted in several forms of human cancer (5, 6).
Folate has been conjugated to a variety of cancer treatment
agents including traditional chemotherapy drugs and other

agents (7–12). In drug delivery, the folate–drug conjugate binds
to FRs and is internalized by endocytosis (4). Within the mildly
acidic environment of the endosome, FRs change conformation, thus releasing the conjugate. A self-immolative linker
contained with the conjugate breaks inside the endosome to
release the active drug, which subsequently diffuses across the
endosomal membrane and exerts its pharmacologic activity
within the cell. The FRs then recycle to the cell surface for
another round of folate conjugate uptake (4).
Of the 4 isoforms of the FR, the a- and b-isoforms are
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored to the cell membrane,
are functional for high-afﬁnity folate binding, and can be
exploited to deliver cancer treatment agents into the cancer
cells (4–12). The expression of FR-a is minimal in normal
tissues and is typically limited to the apical surfaces of a few
polarized epithelia, where it is inaccessible to intravenously
administered folate-conjugated drugs (4, 6). Human cancers
that overexpress FR-a include those arising from epithelial
cells in the ovary, lung, breast, kidney, and colon (4–6, 12). FR-b
is largely expressed on activated macrophages and monocytes,
although it is also expressed in some hematopoietic cancers
and other cancers (4–6).
Although the overexpression of FRs has been documented in
several forms of cancer in humans, FR expression in iUC has
not been deﬁned. This work was carried out to determine FR
expression in human iUC and to study folate-targeted therapy
in a highly relevant animal model of iUC, that is, naturally
occurring iUC in dogs. Naturally occurring iUC (also referred to

as invasive transitional cell carcinoma) in dogs and humans is
very similar in histopathology, molecular features, biologic
behavior including local invasion and distant metastasis, and
chemotherapy response (13). Dogs with iUC offer an ideal
model to evaluate new cancer therapies. Positive ﬁndings from
dog studies can be translated into human studies, as well as
improve the outlook for dogs with cancer. Vinblastine, a vinca
alkaloid chemotherapeutic agent (14), was selected for the
pilot study of folate-targeted therapy in dogs. Vinblastine has
activity against iUC in humans (15, 16) and dogs (17), and it has
been successfully conjugated to folate for therapy in humans
(ref. 9, 18; ongoing phase III clinical trial, Endocyte Inc., West
Lafayette, IN). The objectives of the work were to determine FR
expression in iUC in humans and dogs with comparison to the
normal bladder, and to conduct a pilot study of folate-targeted
therapy in dogs with iUC.

Materials and Methods
FR expression was detected by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) in human and canine iUC samples, with comparison to
normal bladder tissues. Folate uptake and binding were determined by ex vivo folate-binding assay on iUC tissues and by in
vivo nuclear scintigraphy in dogs with iUC. A pilot study was
conducted in dogs with naturally occurring iUC to investigate
the potential antitumor activity and toxicity of folate-targeted
vinblastine treatment. The work was conducted with the
approval of the Institutional Review Board and Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Tissues
Human iUC tissues (primary tumor and lymph node metastases), bladder tissues adjacent to the cancer, and samples
from normal bladders were obtained from the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center Tissue Bank, Indianapolis, Indiana and the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, Midwestern
Division, Columbus, Ohio. Canine iUC (primary tumor, lymph
node, and lung metastases) and normal bladder from normal
dogs were obtained from the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and the Purdue Comparative Oncology
Program, Purdue University (West Lafayette, IN).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted on formalinﬁxed tissues similarly as previously described (19–22). IHC on
human tissues included 3 primary antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal antibody (PU17), a monoclonal antibody to FR-a
(mab343), and a monoclonal antibody to FR-b (mab909) kindly
provided by Dr. Phillip Low, Purdue University, West Lafayette,
Indiana, and by Endocyte. IHC studies focused on FR-a, which
is expressed in other epithelial cancers. Folate-binding assay
and IHC (FR-a and FR-b) were conducted on a subset of
samples. Immunostaining with mab343 and PU17 was carried
out at Purdue University; IHC with mab909 was conducted at
the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. PU17 was selected for
canine tissues, as there was consistent and speciﬁc immunoreactivity in the apical (luminal) membrane and cytoplasm of
renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (positive control; Fig. 1).

tubular epithelial cells (A, positive control). Immunoreactivity was absent
in the paired negative control slide (B; Universal Negative control serum
was applied; Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek). "G" denotes glomerulus.
Marked immunoreactivity was observed in canine primary iUC (C). A
paired negative control slide (D) was evaluated with each iUC section. FR
immunoreactivity was observed in lung metastases (E), as well as in
the normal urothelium in normal bladders (F). In A and B, the scale of bars,
260 mm. In C–F, scale of bars, 65 mm.

There was no immunoreactivity to the monoclonal antibodies
in the canine tissues. With the polyclonal antibody used in the
canine studies, paired negative reagent control slides were
included using the Universal Negative control serum (Biocare
Medical).
Slides were reviewed independently by 3 investigators (L.
Cheng and D. Dhawan for human specimens and J.A. RamosVara and D. Dhawan for canine specimens). Any discrepancies
between reviewers were resolved by screening those cases
concurrently to reach a consensus. The percentage of positively immunostained tumor cells was categorized as follows: 0,
0% to 9% of cells; 1, 10% to 19% of cells; 2, 20% to 49% of cells; 3,
50% to 79% of cells; and 4, 80% to 100% of tumor cells staining.
Staining intensity (0, no staining; 1, equivocal staining; 2,
moderate to intense staining; and 3, highest intensity staining)
was multiplied by category for percentage of positive cells to
determine the IHC score (23, 24). The FR location (membrane

while reacting with the heretobiﬁntional cross-linker,
2-[benzotriazole-1-yl-(oxycarbonyloxy)-ethyldisulfanyl]-pyridine. The product was reacted with the peptide-based folatespacer unit Pte-gGlu-{[(1-amino-1-deoxy-D-glucitol)-Glu]Glu}3-[(1-amino-1-deoxy-D-glucitol)-Glu]-Cys-OH, and the
resulting conjugate puriﬁed by preparative high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). Clean product fractions were
combined, lyophilized, and characterized by 1H-NMR and
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS).
Dose-dependent FR-speciﬁc activity of EC0905 was determined as described previously (Fig. 2B; ref. 26). KB cell (American Type Culture Collection; ATCC) integrity was conﬁrmed
(Genetica DNA Labs, Cincinnati, Ohio) with cells being 100%
identical to reference cells from the ATCC. KB cells from the
ATCC do contain HeLa markers.
The in vivo activity and toxicity of EC0905 were determined
in nu/nu mice (Balb/c-derived; Charles River, Wilmington, MA)
fed a folate-free diet (Harlan diet #TD00434, Harlan Teklad,
Madison, WI) to achieve serum folate concentrations similar
to those in humans (26, 27). EC0905 (2 mmol/kg) or vehicle
control was administered intravenously 3 times per week for
2 weeks to mice with FR-positive KB xenografts, and tumor
size and animal performance were monitored.

or cytoplasm) was recorded. Positive cases were those
with immunoreactivity in 10% or more of tumor cells (IHC
score  1).
Folate-binding assay
Assessment of folate binding in snap-frozen iUC tissues and
control tissues was conducted as previously described (6).
Scintigraphy
Following pet owner consent, privately owned dogs with
naturally occurring iUC were imaged with a technetium-folate
conjugate (99mTc-EC20; ref. 4, 22). Brieﬂy, 5 mCi 99mTc was
added to EC20 solution (Endocyte) and injected intravenously
2 hours before imaging. For imaging, dogs were placed under
general anesthesia. Full-body static images were acquired in
right and left lateral, ventrodorsal, and dorsoventral recumbencies over a 90-second per view time using a single-head
gamma camera (MiE Equine Scanner H.R.; Scintron VI). Various positional acquisitions were also obtained according to
tumor location.
Synthesis of folate–vinblastine conjugate (EC0905) and
conﬁrmation of speciﬁc activity
In preparation for subsequent dog studies, EC0905 (Fig. 2A)
was synthesized (25), and speciﬁc antitumor activity evaluated
in vitro and in vivo in rodents. Desacetylvinblastine hydrazide
was converted to a pyridinyldisulfanyl-activated derivative

Veterinary Teaching Hospital (PUVTH). Dogs lived at home
with their families and came into the PUVTH for evaluation
and treatment. Inclusion criteria included: measurable, histologically conﬁrmed iUC, positive folate uptake detected by
scintigraphy or FR expression observed in the tumor via IHC,
expected survival of 6 weeks or longer, and written dog owner
consent. The pilot study was open to dogs that had failed or
who were not eligible for standard therapy.
EC0905 was administered by rapid injection through an
intravenous catheter once weekly (starting dose 0.2 mg/kg on
the basis of laboratory animal studies and interspecies scaling;
unpublished data, Endocyte). Dose escalation was carried out
within dogs (after 2 doses with no toxicity) and between dogs
(minimum 3 dogs per dose group and 6 dogs treated at the
maximum tolerated dose, MTD). The dose was increased to
0.225 mg/kg, then to 0.25 mg/kg, and later increased by 0.02
mg/kg for each subsequent dose group. Toxicity was assessed
by complete blood counts (CBC), serum chemical proﬁles,
urinalyses, physical exams, and owner observations, and was
classiﬁed by the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group
(VCOG) criteria (28). Urologic toxicity was categorized as
previously described (29). The MTD was deﬁned as the highest
dose that resulted in 0 of 6 dogs having grade 4 toxicity and 0 or
1 of 6 dogs having grade 3 toxicity.
The EC0905 dose was reduced by 10% if grade 2 toxicity was
noted, and by 20% if grade 3 or higher toxicity occurred.
Treatment was delayed if the neutrophil count was less than
3,000/mm3 or platelet count less than 100,000/mm3 the day
treatment was due. Treatment was scheduled to continue until
8 weeks beyond complete remission, until cancer progression,
or until unacceptable toxicity (considered unacceptable by the
dog owner or attending veterinarian) was noted. Dogs that
failed EC0905 due to cancer progression or unacceptable
toxicity were eligible to receive other therapies off study.
Physical exam, medical history, and CBC were carried out
weekly. Monthly evaluation included CBC, serum biochemical proﬁle, urinalysis, urinary tract ultrasound, and ultrasound mapping of bladder masses. Urinary tumors were
measured by a single ultrasound operator following a standardized mapping procedure (30, 31), and estimated tumor
volume was recorded. Ultrasound was selected because it
could be conducted without general anesthesia and urinary
catheterization (as would be required for computed tomography). The coefﬁcient of variation when measuring bladder
masses by this protocol at our institution is typically 3% to
15% (31). Before treatment and at 8-week intervals, complete
tumor staging (thoracic radiography, 3 views; full abdominal
ultrasonography) was carried out, and tumor stage determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for
canine bladder tumors (32). Tumor response was deﬁned as:
complete remission (no cancer detected), partial remission
(PR, 50% decrease in tumor volume and no new tumor
lesions), stable disease (SD, <50% change in tumor volume
and no new tumor lesions), and progressive disease (PD,
50% increase in tumor volume or the development of new
tumor lesions). Permission to conduct a necropsy was
requested at the time of the dog's death (death from cancer
or other causes).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon—Mann–Whitney
test, Spearman's rho (rs), c2 analysis, and Fisher exact test.
P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant for all analyses.

Results
Folate receptor expression and folate uptake in canine
iUC
Samples were studied from 74 dogs with muscle invasive
iUC. Using the WHO classiﬁcation for canine iUC (32), there
were 49 T2 tumors (muscle invasive) and 25 T3 tumors (tumor
invading neighboring organs). There were 40 spayed female, 32
neutered male, and 2 intact male dogs (median age, 11 years;
range, 4–17 years), with several breeds represented. Nodal
metastases were present in 23 dogs (31%), and distant metastases in 28 dogs (38%). FR expression was detected in 56 of 74
(76%) primary tumors (78% of T2, 72% of T3 tumors), in 7 of 12
(58%) nodal metastases, and in 10 of 21 (48%) of lung metastases (Table 1, Fig. 1). In 67% of cases, the FR expression in the
primary tumor and lung metastases were similar (either positive in both sites, or negative in both sites); in 33% of cases, FR
expression was detected in the primary tumor but not in
metastases. The FR expression in the primary tumor did not
differ between dogs with metastases and dogs without metastases. Immunoreactivity was noted in the epithelial cells in 8 of
8 normal bladders from dogs (80% cells positive, 2–3þ
staining intensity, and membrane and cytoplasmic in location).
Folate binding was detected ex vivo in iUC samples from 10
dogs (range, 0.17–3.10; median, 1.31 pmol FR/mg protein). All
10 cases had positive immunoreactivity in tumor cells on IHC.
No differences were observed in IHC ﬁndings (percentage of
positive cells, staining intensity, and stain location) between
samples with the lowest versus the highest folate binding.
Folate binding in normal full-thickness bladder sections (median, 0.13 pmol FR/mg protein; range, 0.05–0.35 pmol FR/mg
protein; n ¼ 7) was signiﬁcantly less (P < 0.0062) than that in
the iUC tissues. The binding in normal bladder mucosal
sections (median, 0.39 pmol FR/mg protein; range, 0.09–1.22
pmol FR/mg protein; n ¼ 5) was not different(P ¼ 0.098) than in
iUC.
Scintigraphy was carried out in 13 dogs, with shipment of the
99m
Tc scheduled to allow scanning with approximately 5 mCi.
The actual mean activity of the injected conjugate was 6.2 mCi
per dog (range, 3.8–10.2 mCi per dog). EC20 uptake was
detected in the iUC (primary and/or metastases) in 12 of 13
dogs (Fig. 3). The 12 dogs with positive scans also had FR
expression in tumor cells detected by IHC. One dog with bulky
spread of the cancer had a negative scan and negative IHC.
With the EC20 being eliminated through the urine, special
steps were required to observe uptake in bladder masses. This
included catheterization, removing urine from the bladder,
and distending the bladder with sterile saline as well as
individual dog positioning based on tumor location within
the bladder. Uptake in the cancer in the urethra and prostate
was observed, especially when the bladder was shielded (Fig. 3).
Six of 13 dogs scanned had histopathologically conﬁrmed
distant metastases of iUC at necropsy. Two additional dogs

had radiographic evidence of lung metastases not conﬁrmed
by biopsy (owners declined necropsy). One of the 2 dogs had
ﬁne needle aspiration cytology consistent with carcinoma; in
the other dog, the pulmonary lesions were considered too small
and deep for safe aspiration. EC20 uptake was observed in 4 of 6
dogs with biopsy-conﬁrmed metastases as well as in 2 of 2 dogs
with radiographic evidence of metastases (Fig. 3). In 2 dogs, the
metastatic lesions were obscured by nonspeciﬁc EC20 uptake
in the liver, as has been previously reported (4). Shielding the
liver facilitated detection of radioactivity in lung metastases
(Fig. 3), although lesions very caudal in the lung ﬁeld were still
overshadowed by the liver.
Folate receptor expression and folate uptake in human
iUC
IHC was conducted on tumor samples from 37 humans with
iUC including 8 T2, 1 T2a, 3 T2b, 2 T3, 7 T3a, 7 T3b, 3 T4, and 6
T4a tumors (WHO 2010 TNM staging system; ref. 33). Nodal
metastases were reported in 23 of the patients. Distant metastases were not detected. The median patient age was 65 years
(range, 39–82 years), and there were 25 male and 11 female
patients (gender was not recorded in 1 patient).
Immunoreactivity to PU17 was noted in tumor cells in 29 of
37 (78%) primary tumors including 83% of T2, 75% of T3, and

www.aacrjournals.org

78% of T4 tumors as well as in 12 of 15 (80%) nodal metastases
(Table 1, Fig. 4). The epithelium adjacent to the tumor had
immunoreactivity to PU17 in 5 of 5 cases studied (50–75%
positive epithelial cells per section, 2–3þ stain intensity,
mostly cytoplasmic). The urothelium in samples from 2 normal
bladders had immunoreactivity to PU17 (>80% positive epithelial cells per section, 2–3þ stain intensity, mostly cytoplasmic). With the mab343, immunoreactivity in tumor cells
was detected in 8 of 37 (22%) primary tumors (25% of T2, 19% of
T3, and 23% of T4 tumors) and in 6 of 17 (35%) nodal
metastases. There was no association between FR expression
in the primary tumor and the T or N stage. The epithelium
adjacent to the tumor was negative in all 5 cases with mab343,
and the urothelium in the normal bladders was negative in 2 of
2 cases.
In the folate-binding assay, binding ranged from 0.06 to 10.12
pmol FR/mg protein (median, 1.71 pmol FR/mg protein, n ¼
17; Table 2). There was a signiﬁcant positive association
between the level of folate binding and IHC score for mab343
(rs, þ0.55; P, 0.023), but not between the level of folate binding
and PU17 IHC score (rs, þ0.45; P, 0.067) or mab909 IHC score
(rs, 0.09; P, 0.75; n, 14). In 2 cases (Table 2, case # 11 and 12),
IHC with PU17 revealed immunoreactivity in inﬂammatory
cells, but not tumor cells. FR-b was expressed in tumor cells in 3

of 14 cases (21%). Folate binding in 1 sample available from a
normal bladder was 0.48 pmol FR/mg protein. Folate binding
was noted in bladder tissues adjacent to the cancer (median,
2.32 pmol FR/mg protein; range, 0.04–3.09 pmol FR/mg protein; n, 5).
In vitro and in vivo activity of EC0905 in mice
In in vitro experiments, FR-positive KB xenografts were
highly sensitive to EC0905 with an IC50 of 2 nmol/L; cytotoxicity was dependent on FR expression (Fig. 2B). EC0905 caused

dose. The 0.25 mg/kg dose group was then expanded to 6 dogs,
and toxicities included grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicity in 3
dogs, grade 1 lethargy in 1 dog, and grade 2 lethargy in 1 dog.
The MTD of EC0905 was deﬁned as 0.25 mg/kg once weekly. No
urologic toxicity occurred. In dogs receiving several weeks of
treatment, dose reduction did become necessary due to GI
toxicity and neutropenia. Neutropenia occurred in 4 dogs
receiving a lower dose of EC0905 (grade 1 in 3 dogs and grade
2 in 1 dog).
Tumor response was assessed in 9 of the 10 dogs. Tumor
response could not be assessed in 1 dog who died following
surgery for acute gastric dilatation and volvulus a few days after
treatment. The dog had no evidence of EC0905 toxicity and had
been eating well; there was no indication that the gastric
dilatation was due to the cancer or treatment. Tumor response
in 9 dogs included partial remission in 5 (56%) dogs and stable
disease in 4 (44%) dogs. Median time to treatment failure was

The IHC score was determined by multiplying the category for percent positive cells (1 ¼ 10–19% positive, 2 ¼ 20–49% positive, 3 ¼
50–79% positive, and 4 ¼ 80–100% positive) by the stain intensity (1–3 with 3 being the most intense stain intensity).

58 days (range, 3–428 days). Treatment failure was due to
cancer progression in 4 dogs, other life-threatening illness
unrelated to cancer or treatment in 3 dogs, other concurrent
cancers in 2 dogs, and discontinuation of EC0905 in 1 dog due
to the dog owner's inability to return the dog for follow-up. Five
of 9 dogs went on to receive other therapies after discontinuing
EC0905. The median survival in all 10 dogs was 115 days (range,
3–428 days). Necropsy was carried out on 6 dogs, and marked
FR expression was still present in the cancer in all 6 dogs.

Discussion
The study results provide strong evidence for the potential
beneﬁt of targeting FRs to treat iUC. In the canine studies, FRs
were expressed in the majority of iUC cases studied, and folate
uptake was conﬁrmed by ex vivo folate-binding assay and by in
vivo scintigraphy. Speciﬁc antitumor activity and safety of
EC0905 was observed in mice, and the drug had impressive
antitumor activity in dogs with iUC. Canine iUC is very similar
to iUC in humans in regard to cellular and molecular features,
sites and frequency of metastases, and response to traditional
chemotherapy drugs (13). Although the pilot study only included 9 dogs with posttreatment follow up, the ﬁnding of partial
remission in 5 dogs (including durable remission of up to 47
weeks) and stable disease in 4 dogs was considered very
positive. In comparison, standard chemotherapy regimens for
iUC in dogs (carboplatin, vinblastine, or mitoxantrone with or
without a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) result in remission (mostly
partial) in approximately 35% of dogs and stable disease in 45%

www.aacrjournals.org

to 50% of dogs (13, 17, 34, 35). Another positive ﬁnding was that
EC0905 was generally well tolerated. As in humans (4, 6, 36), FR
expression was detected in the normal bladder and kidneys in
dogs, but no toxicity to these organs was noted with EC0905.
Lack of renal and urologic toxicity has also been observed with
folate-targeted therapy in humans (18, 37).
The ﬁndings in dogs together with results of the IHC in
human tissues provide justiﬁcation to pursue studies leading
to folate-targeted therapy in humans with iUC. Deﬁning the
percentage of humans that could beneﬁt will require further
study. Using monoclonal antibodies (mab343 and mab909) for
IHC, FR expression in iUC cells was detected in 43% of human
cases. The results of the PU17 IHC suggest that a higher
percentage of human iUCs express FRs, with 78% of samples
having immunoreactivity in the tumor cells. The immunoreactivity to PU17 in macrophages (which express FR-b; refs. 4, 6)
in the iUC sections in dogs and humans suggest that this
polyclonal antibody could bind to FR-b, as well as FR-a in the
cancer cells. It is possible that the ﬁndings with mab343 and
mab909 underestimate the number of patients with FR-positive cancer. Mutations in the FR, other changes in receptor
conﬁrmation, and loss of epitopes over time could preclude
mabs from binding to the FR, leading to an underestimation of
the frequency of FR expression. In addition, subjectively, it
appeared that immunoreactivity was more prevalent in recently collected iUC specimens than from older archival specimens.
A next step would be to conduct scintigraphy to detect folate
uptake in iUC in humans.

The starting dose in the dose-escalation plan was 0.2 mg/kg per week. In 2 dogs, the dose was reduced to less than 2 mg/kg (0.15–0.18
mg/kg) due to myelosuppression.

The scintigraphy studies in dogs provided insight into how
to best observe folate uptake in primary and metastatic iUC.
Observing uptake in metastases is especially important. The
majority of deaths from iUC in humans are due to chemotherapy-resistant metastases (2, 3), and this may be an area
where folate-targeted therapy could be most important. To
observe metastases in close proximity to the liver, it was
necessary to shield the radioactivity in the liver. As previously
observed (4, 38), there can be nonspeciﬁc uptake of 99mTcEC20 in the liver of humans and animals. The administration
of antifolate compounds before the administration of folate
radioconjugates has been reported to reduce uptake in nonmalignant tissues in humans (38). This approach was not used
in the dog study; thus, more background may have been
present. For patients who pursue bladder-sparing treatment
options for iUC (39), being able to detect folate uptake in the
primary tumor in the bladder would also be important. In the
dog studies, using a catheter to remove the radioactive urine
from the bladder and redistending the bladder with saline was
useful in detecting folate uptake in tumor masses in the
bladder. Shielding the liver, kidneys, and bladder facilitated
the detection of the 99mTc-EC20 uptake in nearby organs
(urethra, ureters, prostate, and lymph nodes).

Cancer Res; 73(2) January 15, 2013

The analysis of tissues obtained following EC0905 treatment in dogs offered the opportunity to help rule out 1 of the
possible mechanisms that could lead to failure of folatetargeted therapy over time, that is the potential loss of FRs.
It was important that marked FR expression was still present
in iUC cells in tissues from 6 of 6 cases examined post
treatment. This indicates that patients that have failed
folate–vinblastine could still beneﬁt from other folate–drug
conjugates.
In conclusion, this study provides strong evidence for
the potential beneﬁt of folate-targeted therapy in iUC, and
support for subsequent studies in humans with iUC. FR-b,
as well as FR-a, could be important in iUC. Nuclear
scintigraphy studies could further deﬁne the percentage
of humans who could beneﬁt from folate-targeted therapy.
