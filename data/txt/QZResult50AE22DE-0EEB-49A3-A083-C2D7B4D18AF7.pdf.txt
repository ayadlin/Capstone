ABSTRACT:
Among the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR) has attracted increasing attention as a potential target of
anti-tumor therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). To study the function of PDGFRβ in
CRC cell lines, SW480, DLD-1 and Caco-2 cells showing high PDGFRβ expression
were used for receptor down-regulation by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and using
the pharmacological inhibitor of PDGFRβ Ki11502. Blockade of PDGFRβ using both
approaches led to moderate inhibition of proliferation and diminished activation of the
downstream PI3K-signaling pathway in all three cell lines. Surprisingly, incubation
with Ki11502 resulted in an arrest of SW480 cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle,
whereas the siRNA approach did not result in this effect. To address this difference,
we analyzed the involvement of the PDGFRβ family member c-KIT in Ki11502
effectiveness, but siRNA and proliferation studies in SW480 and DLD-1 cells could
not prove the involvement of c-KIT inactivation during Ki11502 treatment.
Hence, an RTK activation antibody array on SW480 cells led us to the identification
of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC, which is inactivated after Ki11502 treatment
but not after the siRNA approach. Further studies using the SRC-specific inhibitor PP2
showed that SRC inhibition upon treatment with the inhibitor Ki11502 is responsible
for the observed effects of Ki11502 in SW480 and DLD-1 CRC cells. In summary,
our results demonstrate that the inhibition of PDGFRβ alone using siRNA has only
moderate cellular effects in CRC cell lines; however, the multi-target inhibition of
PDGFRβ, c-KIT and SRC, e.g., using Ki11502, represents a promising therapeutic
intervention for the treatment of CRC.

INTRODUCTION

cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Blockade of
EGFR signaling significantly inhibits tumor growth in
animal models of colon cancer [3]. In clinical practice,
using monoclonal antibodies to inhibit EGFR is now well
established in the treatment of CRC [4].
Immunohistochemical studies on human colon
cancer specimens revealed inter- and intratumoral
heterogeneity for the expression of different receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including EGFR, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2), and

Growth factors and their receptors play a significant
role in the regulation of cancer growth, tumor angiogenesis
and metastasis [1, 2], making these molecules attractive
for targeted therapies. One of the approaches to target
a growth factor receptor is the inhibition of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) by inhibiting EGFR
tyrosine kinase using small-molecule inhibitors or
antibody-induced receptor blockade in different human

platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ). This
observation indicates that targeting a single RTK might
not be sufficient for an optimal therapeutic effect [5].
We previously reported that the simultaneous blocking
of two RTK pathways, i.e., the insulin-like growth factor
receptor (IGF-IR) and EGFR pathways, produced more
efficient therapeutic effects in colon cancer cell lines
than the inhibition of a single pathway [6]. From these
observations, it can be speculated that the therapeutic
efficacy can be even further increased by inhibiting more
than two RTK pathways.
PDGF and its receptor PDGFR represent a ligandtyrosine kinase receptor system that is involved in different
tumor-associated processes. PDGF binds to PDGFR and
induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation,
leading to the activation of intracellular signaling pathways
[7]. PDGF plays a role in the autocrine growth stimulation
of tumor cells, regulating tumor stroma fibroblast function
and tumor angiogenesis. Different studies have indicated
that PDGF and PDGFRβ are expressed by tumor cells [8,
9] as well as tumor-associated endothelial cells, pericytes,
and other stromal cells in colon carcinomas [10-12], which
are thought to provide a favorable microenvironment
for the growth and survival of cancer cells [11, 13].
Furthermore, PDGFRβ expression levels are associated
with angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of colon cancer
[10, 14, 15]. A recent study showed significantly increased
PDGFRβ mRNA levels in locally advanced rectal tumors
compared with the corresponding normal mucosa [16].
By contrast, in colon carcinoma cell lines expression of
PDGFRβ at the mRNA level was lower. Imatinib mesylate,
which inhibits phosphorylation of PDGFRβ, decreased the
growth of primary cecal tumors and the incidence of liver
metastasis in an orthotopic nude mouse model [17]. Some
studies have elucidated the role of PDGF in colon cancer
angiogenesis [12, 18].
Therefore, functional aspects of PDGFRβ
expression were studied in CRC cell lines. In the present
study, we showed that blockade of PDGFRβ alone using
an siRNA approach does not lead to a sufficient reduction
of proliferation. Instead, treatment with the PDGFRβ
inhibitor Ki11502 resulted in a clear reduction of the
proliferation and G2 cell cycle arrest of CRC cells, effects
that were shown to be the result of the additional inhibition
of c-KIT and SRC by Ki11502.

and western blotting (Fig. 1). The expression levels of
PDGFRβ in HT-29, HCT116 and SW837 cells were
significantly lower compared with Caco-2 cells (6 ± 5%,
13 ± 5% and 35 ± 13%, respectively). Higher expression
levels of PDGFRβ were detectable in DLD-1 cells (117
± 34%) and in SW480 cells (173 ± 31%) than in Caco2 cells (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis demonstrated
PDGFRβ subunit-specific protein bands in Caco-2, DLD1, SW480 and SW837 cells, respectively, whereas HT-29
and HCT116 cells failed to show any immunoreactivity
against the PDGFRβ antibody (Fig. 1B). SW480 cells
showing the highest PDGFRβ expression were chosen to
study the role of PDGFRβ by siRNA-mediated receptor
blockade or the RTK inhibitor Ki11502.
The expression of PDGFRα was undetectable in the
CRC cell lines studied by quantitative RT-PCR or western
blotting (data not shown).

PDGFRβ blockade results in reduced cell
proliferation
For silencing of PDGFRβ expression in SW480
cells, three different PDGFRβ-specific siRNAs (P37, P58
and P60) were used for transfection studies. SW480 cells
transfected with siRNAs against the luciferase gene (Luc)
were used as controls. The down-regulation of PDGFRβ
mRNA expression in SW480 cells was determined by
quantitative RT-PCR after siRNA transfection (Fig. 1C).
The siRNA-mediated silencing of PDGFRβ mRNA
expression was in the range of 10 to 20% of controls at 72
h after transfection (Fig. 1C).
In SW480 cells, western blot analysis revealed
PDGFRβ-specific protein bands that were down-regulated
in siRNA-transfected SW480 cells to approximately 9% to
13% of control levels of Luc-transfected (Luc) cells at 48
h after transfection and to approximately 5% to 12% at 72
h after transfection (Fig. 1D).
As a second approach, the pharmacological
PDGFRβ tyrosine kinase inhibitor Ki11502 was used. This
inhibitor was tested to be exclusively specific for PDGFRβ
in leukemia and vascular smooth muscle cells (19, 26),
not targeting PDGFRα and c-KIT. To study whether
blockade of PDGFRβ in SW480 cells was associated
with alterations in cell proliferation and apoptosis,
SW480 cells were transfected with PDGFRβ-specific
siRNAs or cultivated in the presence of the inhibitor
Ki11502. The siRNA-dependent blockade of PDGFRβ
was associated with a moderate but significant inhibition
of cell proliferation at 24 and 48 h after transfection
compared with Luc-siRNA-transfected SW480 cells
(Fig. 2A). Seventy-two hours after transfection, PDGFRβ
siRNA transfection was associated with a reduction in cell
proliferation to approximately 74% to 77% of the levels
observed in Luc-transfected SW480 cells. Treatment
of SW480 cells with Ki11502 resulted in the time- and

dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 2B).
Maximal effects were observed after incubating SW480
cells with 20 µM Ki11502 for 72 h, showing a reduction
in cell proliferation to approximately 64% of the levels
observed in DMSO-treated control cells (Fig. 2B).
The siRNA-mediated down-regulation of PDGFRβ
was associated with a moderate increase of up to 5%
dead cells compared with Luc-transfected cells (Suppl.
Fig. 1A). Similarly, the PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
Ki11502 only marginally stimulated the increase of dead
cells at all concentrations tested (Suppl. Fig. 1B).

AKT and ERK1/2. Treatment of SW480 cells with PDGFBB for 20 minutes stimulated the phosphorylation of AKT
(Ser473), but no activation of ERK1/2 was detected (Figs.
2C, 2D). In SW480 cells transfected with the PDGFRβspecific siRNAs P37, P58 and P60, the PDGF-BBmediated phosphorylation of AKT was abrogated (Fig.
2C). The PDGFRβ inhibitor Ki11502 reduced the PDGFBB-induced phosphorylation of AKT upon treatment of
cells with 1 µM Ki11502, showing a significant inhibition
of AKT phosphorylation at a concentration of 5 µM. There
was no detectable change of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Fig. 2D).

with PDGFRβ-specific siRNAs or treated with the
PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor Ki11502 were subjected
to flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3). These experiments
demonstrated that in DMSO-treated control cells, the
major fraction of cells were in the G1 phase (65.2 ± 7.7%),
whereas only a minor portion of cells were in the S or G2
phase, respectively. Treatment of SW480 cells with 20 µM
Ki11502 resulted in a reduction of cells in the G1 phase
(11.4 ± 7.6%), whereas most cells were arrested in the G2
phase (74.8 ± 9.1%) (Figs. 3A, 3B).
Unexpectedly, the down-regulation of PDGFRβ
in SW480 cells using the siRNA approach did not result
in G2 arrest (Suppl. Fig. 2). Cell cycle analyses did not
reveal any detectable changes using flow cytometry.

that Ki11502 is not as specific for PDGFRβ as expected.
Therefore, we first screened different CRC cell lines for
c-KIT, FLT3 and MSCF expression in comparison to the
Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi (Fig. 4A). DLD-1 cells
showed very strong c-KIT expression; however, Caco2 cells showed no c-KIT expression, and SW480 cells
displayed moderate to weak expression. All three cell
lines expressed PDGFRβ at the protein and mRNA levels.
FLT3 and MSCF were only hardly expressed in all cell
lines tested.
To analyze the influence of the Ki11502 inhibitor on
c-KIT activity, we treated DLD-1 and Caco-2 cells with
Ki11502 or down-regulated the expression of PDGFRβ
using the established siRNA approach (Suppl. Figs. 3A,
3B) and measured the capacity of cell proliferation and
cell cycle distribution. DLD-1 cells showed a strong
decrease of proliferation (>60%) 72 h after the inhibition
of PDGFRβ using Ki11502. However, only a moderate
inhibition of proliferation was observed when using the
RNAi approach (Suppl. Figs. 3C, 3E), although the downregulation was verified using qPCR and western blot
analyses (Suppl. Figs. 3A, 3B). Using flow cytometry
analyses, we also observed an increase of cells in the
SubG1 phase, indicating that these cells might undergo

apoptosis (Suppl. Fig. 4A). However, Caco-2 cells
only moderately responded to either type of PDGFRβ
inhibition, showing only a 20% reduction in proliferation
(Suppl. Figs. 3D, 3F). There was an increase of cells in the
G2 phase after Ki11502 inhibitor treatment (Suppl. Fig.
4B).
We then down-regulated the expression of c-KIT
in SW480 (Figs. 4B, 4E) and DLD-1 (Figs. 4C, 4D,
and 4F) cells (high expression of c-KIT) using three
different siRNAs (Figs. 4B, 4C, and 4D). Although c-KIT
expression was diminished in both cell lines, only a
moderate inhibition of proliferation was observed (Figs.
4E, 4F). These results suggest that c-KIT inhibition is not
the underlying cause of the effectiveness of Ki11502 in
SW480 and DLD-1 cells.

SRC is inhibited by Ki11502 and contributes to
the inhibition of proliferation in CRC cell lines
To determine whether other RTKs might be
influenced by treating CRC cells with the Ki11502
inhibitor, we performed an RTK activity assay. Using this
antibody-based approach, we screened for the activity of
several RTKs and their downstream signaling components

after the treatment of SW480 cells with siRNAs against
PDGFRβ, c-KIT, and the combination of both (Fig. 5A), as
well as with two concentrations of Ki11502 (1 and 5 µM).
We performed this array twice with independent biological
samples. In both experiments, the non-receptor tyrosine
kinase SRC showed a special activation pattern: whereas
the downregulation of PDGFRβ, c-KIT or the combination
using the siRNA approach did not result in a change of
SRC phosphorylation, Ki11502 treatment inhibited the
activation of SRC after stimulation with 10% FCS (data
not shown). We verified the array results using the same
biological samples by western blot analysis (Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, the treatment of SW480 and DLD-1 cells
with Ki11502 resulted in a reduction in SRC activation
similar to that observed after treating these cells with the
SRC-specific inhibitor PP2. No difference was observed
among the stimuli used (FCS, IGF-I, EGF or PDGF-BB;
Fig. 5C, Suppl. Fig. 5A). In contrast, the down-regulation
of the receptors PDGFRβ, c-KIT or both did not change

the activation of SRC compared with the controltransfected cells (Fig. 5D, Suppl. Fig. 5B). Additional
treatment of both cell lines showing reduced receptor
expression with the SRC-specific inhibitor PP2 reduced
the phosphorylation of SRC and, therefore, the activity
of this tyrosine kinase. We then analyzed the influence of
SRC inhibition on the proliferation capacity of SW480 and
DLD-1 cells. As depicted in Fig. 6, the down-regulation of
PDGFRβ and c-KIT alone resulted in a moderate decrease
in cell proliferation, whereas adding the SRC-specific
inhibitor PP2 diminished the proliferation capacity to the
level observed after using the PDGFRβ inhibitor Ki11502.
DLD-1 cells responded more strongly to the treatment
with PP2, and proliferation was decreased to levels
observed for the Ki11502 inhibitor. Taken together, these
results support the hypothesis that the PDGFRβ inhibitor
Ki11502 inhibits SRC, thus resulting in the cellular effects
of decreased proliferation and cell cycle arrest, both of
which could not be achieved through the downregulation

specific siRNAs, the mRNA and protein levels of PDGFRβ
in SW480 cells were significantly decreased. The
siRNA-mediated knockdown of the PDGFRβ inhibited
the proliferation of SW480 cells, whereas its effect on
cytotoxicity was only marginal. The pharmacological
inhibition of PDGFRβ by the inhibitor Ki11502 resulted
in a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation and showed
no significant effect on the cytotoxicity of SW480 cells,
even when cells were treated with high concentrations
of Ki11502 (>5 µM). The activation of PDGFRβ by
PDGF-BB induced the phosphorylation of AKT, which
is a known downstream component of the signaling
pathways of PDGFRβ. Receptor blockade via siRNA

DISCUSSION
In the present study, a subset of different CRC
cell lines was analyzed for the expression of the α- and
β-subunits of PDGFR. The highest levels of PDGFRβ
were detectable in SW480 cells, whereas PDGFRα was
below the limits of detection in all CRC lines analyzed.
Therefore, SW480 cells were firstly used to investigate the
effect of the down-regulation of PDGFRβ expression using
siRNA technology and the pharmacological inhibitor of
PDGFRβ tyrosine kinase Ki11502, which was described to
be specific for PDGFRβ. After transfection with PDGFRβ-

with higher concentrations of Ki11502, SW480 cells
were arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This effect
was not visible using the siRNA approach, leading us to
ask whether the small-molecule inhibitor Ki11502 was
not as specific as expected from the literature [19]. Due
to the high expression of c-KIT in DLD-1 cells, which
responded to the treatment with Ki11502 to a higher extent
than SW480 cells, we speculated that c-KIT inhibition by
Ki11502 might be the underlying cause of the difference
between the siRNA approach and small-molecule inhibitor
treatment. This hypothesis was supported by the finding
that Caco-2 cells, which express c-KIT beyond the limits
of detection, did not present with reduced proliferation
after treatment with Ki11502. However, the downregulation of c-KIT alone or in combination with PDGFRβ
in SW480 and DLD-1 cells did not result in the observed
effects mediated by Ki11502, indicating that additional
c-KIT inhibition is unlikely to be an underlying molecular
cause of Ki11502 inhibition.
Therefore, we performed antibody-based screening
of RTKs and their signaling activation. Using this
approach, we determined that the tyrosine kinase SRC
was inactivated after Ki11502 treatment in CRC cells,
whereas there was no influence on or even an increase in
SRC activation after the down-regulation of PDGFRβ,
c-KIT or both using siRNAs. SRC plays an integral role
in multiple cellular processes through its interaction with
structural and signaling proteins through its SH2 and SH3

domains, including invasion, migration, proliferation,
angiogenesis, and apoptosis. SRC is activated by
several processes, including binding to growth factor
receptors and integrins. Because SRC activation has been
implicated in a large percentage of common solid tumor
types, SRC has become a recent target for drug therapy
(reviewed in [20]). In CRC, SRC deregulation was found
in 80% of cases, with increasing SRC activity along
the adenoma-carcinoma sequence from normal mucosa
and colonic polyps to distant liver metastases [21, 22].
Hence, increased SRC activity represents an independent
indicator of poor clinical prognosis in all stages of colon
cancer [23].
SRC plays a critical role in the mediation of
signaling through PDGFR [24, 25]. Therefore, we
cannot fully rule out that the reduced activation of SRC
after treatment with the inhibitor Ki11502 is due to the
inhibition of PDGFR signaling, whereas residual active
PDGFRβ in PDGFRβ knockdown cells can still activate
downstream signaling via SRC. Nevertheless, in the
latter case, we expected at least the minimal inhibition
of SRC activation, which was completely absent in our
experiments. This result supports our hypothesis that
Ki11502 does additionally inhibit SRC activation. Notably,
in the original publication, the specificity of Ki11502 was
verified by screening the activation status of a number of
RTKs; however, the influence of Ki11502 on the activation
of SRC was not investigated [19]. Subsequent publications
considering Ki11502 also did not include SRC in their
portfolio [26, 27].
Our results also continue the discussion of whether

FIGURE 6 : Influence of SRC inhibition on the proliferation capacity of CRC cells. DLD-1 and SW480 cells were transfected

with siRNAs against PDGFRβ (P37), c-KIT (cK6) or both (P37+cK6) in the presence or absence of 10 µM of the SRC inhibitor PP2.
Proliferation was determined 72 h after transfection. Treatment with PP2 in addition to the down-regulation of PDGFRβ and c-KIT results
in a stronger reduction of proliferation, showing the highest effects in DLD-1 cells compared with the effects of PP2 single treatments.
Treatment with Ki11502 still demonstrates stronger effects than the combination strategy of siRNA and PP2. Statistically significant
differences relative to Luc siRNA-transfected and DMSO treated CRC cells are indicated, respectively: *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 (Student’s
t-test).

the down-regulation of certain proteins using siRNA
or knockout approaches is the correct methodology to
validate the specificity of small-molecule inhibitors
[28]. On the one hand, an exclusive examination of our
siRNA studies against PDGFRβ would have resulted in
the findings that PDGFRβ plays a minor role in CRC and
that targeting this RTK will not lead to an improvement
of therapy options for patients. On the other hand,
focusing only on small-molecule inhibitor studies would
have clearly indicated the need for further studies on the
influence of PDGFRβ in CRC and in the continued use
of this therapy option, not knowing that the observed
effects are due to the side inhibition of additional kinases.
Only a comparison of the results of both studies led to
our hypothesis that PDGFRβ alone is not essential in
the progression of CRC. However, effective blockade of
PDGFRβ together with its family member c-KIT and the
downstream signaling molecule SRC might be a promising
therapy approach for CRC in the future.
The blockade of multiple RTKs as a molecular
targeted therapy option is not a new issue. We [6] and
others [29] have already shown that the inhibition of
more than one RTK is more effective in the treatment
of various solid tumors than is a single-RTK blockade.
Three different PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are
currently under clinical investigation for the treatment
of CRC, i.e., imatinib mesylate, sunitinib, and sorafenib,
which all inhibit, in addition to PDGFR, other RTKs such
as SCF, VEGF and KIT or the Raf cascade, respectively
[30, 31]. Imatinib mesylate has shown anti-tumor activity
in human CRC cells in preclinical and phase II studies
[32]. A phase I/II study of XELOX in combination with
bevacizumab and imatinib in first-line metastatic CRC
(mCRC) is ongoing. Phase II/III studies are evaluating
the activity of sunitinib and sorafenib in patients with
mCRC. Sorafenib has shown clinical activity in the
initial phase I study. A phase II study of sorafenib and
capecitabine (SorCape) in previously treated metastatic
colorectal cancer (mCRC) (NCT01471353) showed
promising results, with a preliminary PFS of 4.1 months
[33]. In addition, several clinical trials have tested the
activity of sorafenib in combination with oxaliplatin- and
irinotecan-based chemotherapy and with other targeted
therapies, such as cetuximab, in mCRC patients. Novel
multi-targeted kinase inhibitors have been developed, e.g.,
ABT-348, a new ATP-competitive multi-targeted kinase
inhibitor against Aurora, VEGF/PDGFR and SRC with
nanomolar potency [34]. The first in vitro and xenograft
studies demonstrated high efficiency in solid tumors and
hematological malignancies for ABT-348 and are now
awaiting in vivo approval.
In summary, the present study shows that the
inhibition of PDGFRβ alone has no effective influence
in CRC cells, but blockade of PDGFRβ, c-KIT and SRC
using the small-molecule inhibitor Ki11502 decreases the
proliferation capacity of CRC cells, supporting ongoing

studies for the implementation of such multitarget
treatments in clinical issues.

Cell lines and cell culture
The human colon cancer cell lines SW480, Caco2 and DLD-1 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) and
approved for cell line contamination using STR-profiling.
Caco-2 cells were maintained in Minimum Essential
Medium (MEM) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum
(FCS), and DLD-1 and SW480 cells were maintained
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 1.2%
penicillin/streptomycin (PAN-Systems) at 37°C and 5%
CO2 in humidified air. The medium was changed three
times per week, and cells were passaged using trypsin/
EDTA.

Treatment of CRC cells
Before addition of stimuli, cells were allowed to
grow until 70% confluency and were then washed with
PBS. All cultures were maintained under serum-reduced
conditions by addition of the specified media without FCS
1045

overnight, and then incubated with or without growth
factors (1 nM IGF-I, 100 ng/ml EGF, 10 ng/ml PDGFBB) for 10 minutes at 37°C. The cells were washed with
cold PBS and immediately processed for RNA isolation
or protein extraction. For treatment with Ki11502 and
PP2, cells were incubated in the presence of the inhibitor
for 48 h followed by serum starvation overnight. Growth
factors were added the next day for 10 minutes, followed
by protein isolation.

line primer design program (http://www-genome.wi.mit.
edu/genome_software/other/primer3.html.). Primers used
for quantitative RT-PCR are listed in the supplemental
information section of the current manuscript. A standard
curve for quantitative PCR was generated with the same
reaction set-up using one control sample as a standard
(1:4 to 1:80). Fluorescence signals were monitored using
the 7900HT sequence detection system and terminated
when all reactions reached an amplification plateau,
whereas a template-free control remained at a basal level.
Data analysis was performed using the detection system
software SDS 2.1 (Applied Biosystems). To verify that
only specific PCR products evoked fluorescence signals,
PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels and analyzed
using the E.A.S.Y. Win 32 software (Herolab, Wiesloch,
Germany). Receptor mRNA expression was normalized
to both PBGD and TBP mRNA expression, respectively,
to compensate for different sample capacities. All
quantification assays were performed in triplicate.

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate,
protease inhibitors (complete mini) and PhosStop (both
Roche). Protein concentration was determined using
the Bradford assay (Nanoquant, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe,
Germany). Aliquots of 10 to 50 µg of total cell lysates
were boiled and denatured in sample buffer containing
SDS and dithiothreitol (DTT; Invitrogen) followed by gel
electrophoresis using a NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris pre-cast
gel (Invitrogen) in MES buffer (Invitrogen). The proteins
were electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane (MachereyNagel, Düren, Germany). The membrane was blocked
in 5% dry milk in TBS-T for 1 hour at RT and was then
incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight.
After washing the membrane three times, proteins were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according
to the manufacturer´s instructions (ECL Plus and ECL
Prime; GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). The signals
were captured using a FluoroChem Q (Biozym Scientific
GmbH, Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany) and analyzed using
FluoroChem Q SA Software (Biozym Scientific GmbH).

Transfection
CRC cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density
of 6.5 × 104 cells per well before transfection with siRNA
oligonucleotides. After an incubation of 24 h, the cells
were transfected using Oligofectamine Reagent and
OPTIMEM I medium (both from Invitrogen, Karlsruhe,
Germany) according to the supplier’s instructions with
different IGF-IR or EGFR gene-specific stealth™
siRNA duplex oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) at a final
concentration of 80 nM, respectively. As a control, cells
were transfected with siRNA duplex oligonucleotides
(Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) against the firefly
(Photinus pyralis) luciferase gene (Luc). Forty-eight and
seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were collected
and used in the following experiments. The target
sequences of the gene-specific stealth™ siRNA were as
follows:

Reverse transcription and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA from cells was extracted using
TriReagent (Sigma). RNA integrity and quantity
were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and
spectrophotometry, respectively. Subsequently, 1 µg of
total RNA was reverse transcribed using Oligo dT primers
and the Superscript Plus Kit (both from Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer´s instructions. The
quantification of receptor expression and the expression of
the two housekeeping genes porphobilinogen deaminase
(PBGD) and TATA box binding protein (TBP) was
determined using the 7900HT sequence detection system
(Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) using the
SYBR-Green chemistry kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
The 5-µl reaction from the kit was supplemented with
2.5 µl of cDNA (diluted 1:20) and 0.25 µM of genespecific primers for PDGFRβ, c-KIT, FLT3, MCSF,
PBGD and TBP, respectively. All primers (Operon,
Cologne, Germany) were designed using the primer3 onwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
All experiments were replicated three or four times.
Autoradiographs of western blots were scanned (BIORAD, Hercules, CA, USA). After background subtraction,
the densitometry of individual bands was analyzed using
the ImageJ software (Version 1.34 s, NIH, Bethesda)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative
densities of the bands were expressed as a percentage of
the control. Proliferation assays, cell viability experiments
and apoptosis studies were each performed in triplicate.
The means ± standard deviation (SD) were indicated
relative to the control. Student’s t-test for paired values
was used, and a P value less than 0.05 was deemed to be
statistically significant.

After transfection with siRNA oligonucleotides
or treatment with the accordant inhibitors, cells (5 ×
103 cells/well) were plated in 100 μl of cell culture
medium in a 96-well plate as described above. After
different periods of incubation (3, 24, 48 and 72 h),
cell proliferation was determined using the CellTiter
96® AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay
(MTS; Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. A microplate reader (E800x;
BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, Vermont) was used to
measure the optical density at a wavelength of 495 nm and
a reference wavelength of 620 nm. All experiments were
performed in triplicate. For measuring cytotoxicity, the
LDH Plus Cytotoxicity Kit (Roche) was used according
to the manufacturer´s instructions.

To analyze receptor activation, the PathScan RTK
signaling antibody array (Cell Signaling) was used
according to the manufacturer´s instructions. Briefly,
SW480 cells were transfected with siRNAs against
luciferase gene, PDGFRβ (siRNA P37), c-KIT (siRNA
cK6) or both PDGFRβ and c-KIT and were then incubated
for 48 hours. After serum starvation overnight, cells were
stimulated with 10% FCS for 10 minutes, and the protein
was isolated. For treatment with the inhibitor, SW480
cells were incubated in the presence of 1 µM and 5 µM
Ki11502 for 48 h, respectively, serum-starved overnight
and stimulated with 10% FCS according to the siRNA
samples. Next, 45 µg of protein at a concentration of 0.3
mg/ml was hybridized to the antibody array. Fluorescent
readout was performed on a Fluorochem Q (Biozym).
Data analyses were carried out using the Fluorochem Q
SA software.
