ABSTRACT
Stichoposide D (STD) is a marine triterpene glycoside isolated from sea
cucumbers. We examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity
of STD in human leukemia cells. The role of Fas (CD95), ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6)
and p38 kinase during STD-induced apoptosis was examined in human leukemia
cells. In addition, the antitumor effects of STD in K562 and HL-60 leukemia xenograft
models were investigated. We found that STD induces Fas translocation to lipid rafts,
and thus mediates cell apoptosis. We also observed the activation of CerS6 and p38
kinase during STD-induced apoptosis. The use of methyl-β-cyclodextrin and nystatin
to disrupt lipid rafts prevents the clustering of Fas and the activation of CerS6 and p38
kinase, and also inhibits STD-induced apoptosis. Specific inhibition by Fas, CerS6, and
p38 kinase siRNA transfection partially blocked STD-induced apoptosis. In addition,
STD has antitumor activity through the activation of CerS6 and p38 kinase without
displaying any toxicity in HL-60 and K562 xenograft models. We observed that the
anti-tumor effect of STD is partially prevented in CerS6 shRNA-silenced xenograft
models. We first report that Fas/CerS6/p38 kinase activation in lipid rafts by STD is
involved in its anti-leukemic activity. We also established that STD is able to enhance
the chemosensitivity of K562 cells to etoposide or Ara-C. These data suggest that STD
may be used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents to treat
leukemia.

C2-ceramide is capable of inducing DNA fragmentation.
Interestingly, resistance to radiation therapy developed
because of defective ceramide metabolism has been
reported in Burkitt’s lymphoma and myeloid leukemia
[5]. Therefore, manipulation of ceramide metabolism in
patients to promote ceramide production may be helpful in
chemotherapeutic treatment [1]. Thus, there is demand for
a novel compound that is able to augment the production
of ceramide during chemotherapy, potentiating cell killing
and leading to more effective anti-leukemic strategies.

INTRODUCTION
Ceramide is a structural component of the
membrane with important roles in the regulation of cell
growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and cell senescence
[1]. Ceramide is generated by de novo biosynthesis
through ceramide synthases (CerS) or by membrane
sphingomyelin (SM) degradation, which is catalyzed
by sphingomyelinases (SMases) [2, 3]. Obeid et al. [4]
reported that in leukemia, the synthetic ceramide analog

Many investigators have recently focused on the
development of anticancer agents from natural marine
compounds. Marine triterpene glycosides are known to
have a wide spectrum of biological activities, including
antifungal, antitumor, hemolytic, and cytostatic activity
against various tumor cells [6, 7]. Previous studies have
demonstrated that stichoposides from sea cucumbers
have antifungal, cytotoxic, and antitumor activities
[8]. In a previous study, we showed that stichoposide C
(STC) induces apoptosis by generating ceramide through
the activation of acid SMase after activating caspase-8,
and through the activation of neutral SMase resulting
from GSH depletion and increased ROS production [9].
However, it was reported that stichoposide D (STD),
a structural analog of STC that contains glucose in its
carbohydrate chain instead of quinovose (Fig. 1A),
induces apoptosis through the activation of CerS in
HL-60 and K562 cells [10]. In a previous study, fumonisin
B1 (FB1), a chemical inhibitor of CerS, was used to
evaluate the involvement of CerS in STD-mediated
cell death. However, which of six mammalian CerS is
affected by STD, and how this action is connected with
its influence on various mechanisms that stimulate tumor
cell death, remained obscure. For this reason, we aimed to
employ CerS siRNA transfection to confirm the essential
role of CerS in STD-induced apoptosis and to determine
which type of CerS is involved in STD-induced cell death.
Here, we show that STD is able to enhance ceramide
generation by up-regulating CerS6, and therefore modulate
the phosphorylation of p38 kinase, leading to apoptosis
in K562 cells, HL-60 cells, and human primary leukemia
cells derived from patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). Our results suggest that STD is a promising
compound that may be useful in future novel antileukemia strategies by targeting multiple pathways along
with ceramide generation through the activation of Fas and
CerS6, leading to p38 kinase activation in lipid rafts.

inhibitor of CerS, was used to evaluate the involvement
of CerS in STD-mediated cell death. However, we do not
know which type of CerS is involved in STD-induced
cell death. Thus, we examined the expression of CerS4,
CerS5, and CerS6 during STD-induced apoptosis. STD
treatment markedly induced CerS6 expression, but not
CerS4 or CerS5 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1A,
S1B). Thus, we focused on the role of CerS6 in STDmediated cell death. We used Western blot analysis
and immunofluorescence staining to examine CerS6
expression during STD-induced apoptosis. We found that
treatment with STD increases the expression of CerS6 in
K562 and HL-60 cells (Fig. 1C, 1D).
To further confirm the essential role of CerS6
activation in STD-mediated cell death, K562 and
HL-60 cells were transiently transfected with two different
siRNAs against CerS6 (CerS6 siRNA-1, CerS6 siRNA-2)
and compared with cells transfected with nonspecific
control siRNA. Knockdown of CerS6 was confirmed by
Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining
(Fig. 1C, 1D). The extent of apoptosis was monitored in
transfected cells exposed to STD. Knockdown of CerS6
by two different siRNAs partially protects cells from STDinduced apoptosis (Fig. 1E).

Activation of CerS6 by STD occurs downstream
of Fas activation, and upstream of activation of
caspase-8 and the mitochondrial pathway

RESULTS

To investigate the hierarchy of events accompanying
STD-induced cell death, activation of Fas, caspase-8,
and the mitochondrial pathway by STD were monitored
in CerS6 siRNA-transfected K562 and HL-60 cells. Fas
activation was not reversed by CerS6 siRNA transfection
(Fig. 1C, 1D). However, activation of caspase-8;
loss of MMP; cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c,
Smac/DIABLO, and AIF; and activation of caspase-9 or
caspase-3 after STD exposure were reversed by CerS6
siRNA transfection (Fig. 1C, 1E, 1F).

STD induces apoptosis by activating CerS6

Knockdown of Fas inhibits STD-induced
CerS6 activation and apoptosis

To evaluate the effect of STD on the growth of
K562 and HL-60 cells, cells were treated with STD
(0, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 μM) for 24 h. Cell viability was
determined using the MTT assay. STD significantly
inhibited the growth of K562 and HL-60 cells in a dosedependent manner [IC50 of STD: 1.0 μM (K562 cells)
and 1.5 μM (HL-60 cells)] (Fig. 1B). To confirm the
induction of apoptosis by STD, K562 and HL-60 cells
were treated with various concentrations of STD for 6 h
and co-stained with propidium iodide (PI) and FITCconjugated annexin V. STD treatment resulted in a dosedependent increase in apoptotic cell proportions (Fig. 1B).
In a previous study, fumonisin B1 (FB1), a chemical

STD treatment activates Fas (Fig. 1C, 1D). To
evaluate the functional significance of Fas activation
in STD-induced apoptosis, K562 and HL-60 cells were
transiently transfected with a Fas siRNA, and compared
with cells transfected with nonspecific control siRNA.
Knockdown of Fas was confirmed by Western blot
analysis and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2A, 2B),
and the extent of apoptosis was monitored in transfected
cells exposed to STD. Knockdown of Fas partially
protected cells from STD-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2C).

of Fas also reduced STD-induced CerS6 activation and

siRNA transfection inhibited activation of caspase-8;

pathway were also partially inhibited (Fig. 4A, 4C, 4D,
Supplementary Fig. S2B).

P38 kinase activation occurs downstream of
Fas and CerS6 activation and upstream of the
mitochondrial pathway, and may contribute to
STD-induced apoptosis in human leukemic cells

The above observations suggest that STD activates
Fas and CerS6, leading to ceramide generation, and then
activates p38 kinase. To examine the clustering of these
signaling molecules (Fas, CerS6, ceramide, and p38
kinase) in lipid rafts during STD-induced apoptosis, K562
and HL-60 cells were pretreated with the cholesteroldepleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and
nystatin 1 h before treatment with STD, and the extent of
apoptosis and the activation of Fas, caspase-8, caspase-9,
caspase-3, and CerS6 was determined and compared with
STD-treated cells. Incubation of K562 and HL-60 cells
with MβCD and nystatin inhibited STD-induced apoptosis,
as well as the activation of Fas, caspase-8, caspase-9,
caspase-3, and CerS6 (Fig. 5A–5C, Supplementary
Fig. S3A).
The cholera toxin (CTx) B subunit binds to
ganglioside GM1, which is mainly found in rafts. Using the
lipid raft marker Alexa 488-labeled CTx B, we observed
that STD promoted the co-aggregation of Fas/CD95,
CerS6, ceramide, p-p38 kinase, active caspase-8, and
rafts in K562 and HL-60 cells (Fig. 5C, Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Furthermore, incubation of K562 and HL-60
cells with MβCD inhibited STD-induced activation of the
mitochondrial pathway (Fig. 5D, 5E).

Clustering of Fas and its downstream signaling
molecules in lipid rafts during STD-induced
apoptosis

Ceramide activates multiple signaling pathways,
including the mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) [11–15]. MAPKs, including the extracellular
signal regulating kinase (ERK), p38 kinase, and c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK), are centrally involved in
stress-induced cell death, as well as in apoptotic
signaling of ceramide. MAPKs are also involved in cell
survival and stress-induced cell death, in which ERK
exerts the opposing effects of p38 kinase and JNK on
apoptosis. To investigate whether ERK, JNK, and p38
kinase were involved in STD-induced apoptosis, K562
and HL-60 cells were treated with STD for a range
of times, and MAPK protein levels were measured
by Western blot analysis. STD activates all MAPKs
in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). To ascertain
the roles of activated ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase in
STD-induced cell death, we used specific inhibitors
of ERK (PD98059), JNK (SP600125), and p38 kinase
(SB203580) and measured the extent of apoptosis
after 6 h of STD treatment. Inhibition of p38 kinase
significantly reduced apoptosis, but ERK and JNK
inhibition did not reduce STD-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 3B). The inhibition of p38 kinase also significantly
inhibited caspase-8 activation and mitochondrial
pathway (Fig. 3C–3F, Supplementary Fig. S2A, S2C),
but not the activation of Fas, CerS6, or ceramide
generation by STD (Fig. 3C, 3D, Supplementary Fig.
S2A, S2C).
To confirm that p38 kinase plays a crucial role in
STD-mediated apoptosis, K562 and HL-60 cells were
transiently transfected with a p38 kinase siRNA, and
compared with cells transfected with nonspecific control
siRNA. Knockdown of p38 kinase was confirmed by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Fig. S2B),
and the extent of apoptosis was monitored in transfected
cells exposed to STD. Knockdown of p38 kinase partially
protected cells from STD-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B).
To investigate the hierarchy of events accompanying
STD-induced cell death, activation of Fas and CerS6
were monitored in p38 kinase siRNA-transfected cells.
Knockdown of p38 kinase did not reduce STD-induced

STD induces apoptosis through the activation
of Fas, CerS6, and p38 kinase in primary
human leukemia cells, but not in normal human
hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+ cells)
To evaluate whether the induction of apoptosis
through the activation of Fas, CerS6, and p38 kinase
by STD is specific to HL-60 and K562 cells, or
a more general effect, the same experiment was
performed in other types of human primary leukemia
cells. We also observed the induction of apoptosis
by STD in human primary leukemia cells from five
patients with different types of AML, although the
effective concentration of STD used in each cell line
was different (Fig. 6A, Table 1). The characteristics
of each patient were summarized in Table 1. These
results indicated that STD can induce apoptosis in
different AML types. In contrast, the concentrations
of STD that were used in this study (1.0–2.5 μM) did
not increase apoptosis in normal human hematopoietic
progenitor cells (CD34+ cells) compared with control,
as further confirmed by annexin-V/PI staining
(Fig. 6B). We used immunofluorescence to confirm the
molecular mechanisms underlying STD-induced apoptosis

both models (Fig. 7A). The tumors from control mice
displayed the typical histologic appearance of leukemic
cells. After 21 d, the mean volume of tumors in STDtreated mice was more than 70% smaller than that of
tumors in vehicle-treated HL-60 and K562 xenograft
mice, respectively (control group: 4447.89 ± 867.45
mm3, 2963.44 ± 528.73 mm3; STD group: 1327.70 ±

markedly decreased in sections from STD-treated HL60 and K562 xenograft tumors, and apoptotic regions
exhibited inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 7B). As
expected, tumors from vehicle-treated control mice
exhibited weak expression of CerS6 and p-p38 by
Western blot (Fig. 7C), and stained weakly for CerS6,
ceramide, and p-p38 (Fig. 7D). In contrast, Western
blot and immunohistochemical analysis of tumors from
STD-treated mice revealed up-regulation of CerS6,
ceramide, and p-p38 (Fig. 7C, 7D). The expression and
staining of p38 kinase did not differ between control and
STD-treated tumors (Fig. 7C, 7D). We employed CerS6
shRNA knockdown in a stable K562 cell xenograft
model in order to investigate the involvement of
CerS6 in the antitumor activity of STD in vivo. CerS6silenced cells and nonspecific control (NC) cells were
subcutaneously inoculated into 6-week-old nude mice
in parallel. Next, STD or vehicle was injected into each
mouse. We observed that the anti-tumor effect of STD is
partially inhibited in CerS6 shRNA-silenced xenograft
models (Fig. 7E; 77.2% and 75.2% inhibition of tumor
growth in NC-shRNA-1 and NC-shRNA-3 xenograft
models, respectively, vs. 23.5% and 18.0% inhibition
of tumor growth by STD in CerS6-shRNA-1 and NCshRNA-5 xenograft models, respectively). These data
are consistent with in vitro findings.

many traditional chemotherapeutic agents, such as the
topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide [16]. To investigate
whether STD treatment affects the sensitivity of K562
cells to etoposide or Ara-C, K562 cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of etoposide or Ara-C for 24 h,
then analyzed by MTT assay and Annexin V/PI staining.
The combination index values for apoptosis induction
were determined using the median effect method of Chou
and Talalay [17]. The combination index values were
< 1, indicating a synergistic interaction (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Thus, these data suggest that STD can be used
alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic
agents in treating leukemia.

DISCUSSION
Ceramides with distinct acyl chain lengths are
synthesized by the CerS family, which consists of six
members, CerS1–6 [18, 19]. Different CerS also display
remarkably different biological properties; each has
distinct roles in processes as diverse as oncogenesis, tumor
suppression, the response to chemotherapeutic drugs, and
apoptosis [20]. Previous studies have suggested that upregulation of CerS4 and CerS6 leads to inhibition of cell
proliferation and induction of apoptosis, and that CerS2
up-regulation increases cell proliferation [21]. Some
reports have demonstrated that CerS2 overexpression
confers partial protection from irradiation-induced
apoptosis, while the overexpression of CerS5 and CerS6
increases apoptosis in HeLa cells [22]. We found that STD
markedly increased CerS6 expression, but not CerS4 or
CerS5 expression. CerS6 siRNA transfection resulted in
the inhibition of STD-induced ceramide generation and
apoptosis. These data suggest that the activation of CerS6
might be involved in STD-induced apoptosis.
A previous study suggested that CerS6 overexpression might be involved in drug-induced Fas/CD95
activation and enhanced tumor cell killing [22, 23]. Fas
activation was not reversed by CerS6 siRNA transfection.
However, CerS6 activation and ceramide production were
reversed by Fas siRNA knockdown. These data indicate

STD enhances the chemosensitivity of K562 cells
to etoposide or Ara-C
Ceramide production is reportedly helpful in
chemotherapy [1]. In this study, we observed ceramide
generation by STD (Fig. 1D). K562 is resistant to

that STD leads to Fas activation, followed by CerS6 activation and ceramide generation.
MAPKs play a central role in stress-induced cell
death, as well as ceramide signaling during apoptosis.
Ceramide causes ERK dephosphorylation, and induces
p38 kinase and JNK phosphorylation [11–15]. Ceramideactivated p38 kinase and JNK contribute to cell apoptosis
through mitochondrial damage and caspase activation.
However, the upstream mechanisms regarding p38 kinase
and JNK activation by ceramide remain unresolved
[24]. There is mounting evidence that ceramide is an
important regulator of p38 kinase in various cell systems
[24, 25]. Although some studies indicate that p38 kinase
acts downstream of ceramide, the opposite has also been
described [26], suggesting that ceramide-associated
regulation of p38 kinase may differ depending on the cell
system. The present study shows that the activation of p38
kinase in response to STD occurs downstream of Fas and
CerS6 activation, and upstream of caspase-8 activation
and the mitochondrial pathway.
Lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol and
sphingolipids (glycosphingolipids and SM) and actively
participate in metabolic and signal transduction processes,
particularly in the Fas receptor death pathway [27, 28].
The plasma membrane has been considered the most
important target, other than DNA, for many anticancer
drugs [29]. However, little is understood about the key
early plasma membrane events that are involved in
chemotherapy-induced cell death. Because the role of
plasma membrane lipid rafts in drug-induced apoptosis
was reviewed recently [30], the present paper focused on
the role of the Fas death receptor pathway and ceramideenriched membrane domains in STD-induced cell death
using MβCD and nystatin. STD induced Fas clustering
in lipid rafts. The Fas downstream signaling molecules
CerS6, ceramide, p38 kinase, and caspase-8 were also
co-localized in lipid rafts upon STD stimulation, and
MβCD blocked STD-induced Fas and the clustering of
downstream signaling molecules. These results suggest
that the clustering of Fas and downstream signaling
molecules in lipid rafts is essential in STD-induced
apoptosis.
STD treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth
compared with control and led to the up-regulation of
CerS6 and ceramide, as well as the activation of p38
kinase, in mouse HL-60 and K562 leukemic xenograft
models. The anti-tumor effect of STD was partially
prevented in CerS6 shRNA-silenced xenograft models.
These results are consistent with in vitro data. In addition,
the lack of toxicity toward normal hematopoietic
progenitor cells points to STD as a potential candidate
for therapeutic use. We also observed that STD is able to
enhance the chemosensitivity of K562 cells to etoposide
or Ara-C. Thus, these data suggest that STD may be used
alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic
agents in the treatment of leukemia.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Future studies are needed to explore the antitumor
activity of STD in other leukemias (e.g., lymphocytic
leukemia) and other types of cancer, as well as
investigations of the detailed molecular mechanism
involved in STD-induced apoptosis.
This study provides the first evidence that STD
induces apoptosis of human leukemic cells through
ceramide generation by activating CerS6 as a result of
Fas clustering and p38 kinase activation in lipid rafts
(Fig. 8). In addition, STD has antitumor activity through
the activation of CerS6 and p38 kinase in vivo. These
results suggest that STD may be of therapeutic relevance
in the treatment of human leukemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell preparations
Human leukemic K562 and HL-60 cell lines were
obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul National
University, Seoul, Korea) and cultured in RPMI1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
Human hematopoietic progenitor CD34+ cells were
purchased from STEM CELL Technologies (Vancouver,
BC) and were cultured in Hematopoietic Progenitor
Expansion Medium DXF with cytokine mix E (PromoCell,
Heidelberg, Germany). Human primary leukemic cells
were obtained from five patients with AML at the Dong-A
University Hospital, Busan, Korea. Informed consent
was obtained from all patients before sample collection,
according to the Institutional guidelines. Clinical data
were obtained by retrospective review of medical
records. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated
by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont,
Buckinghamshire, UK) density-gradient centrifugation.
Samples ranged from 75% to 91% blasts. Flow cytometry
immunophenotyping using CD45 dim (+), lineage-specific
(myeloid) markers, and side scatter (SSC) confirmed
that cell sample purity exceeded 95%. These cells were
cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
Cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of
95% air/5% CO2 at 37°C.

Reagents
STD was isolated according to the procedure
published by Stonik et al [31]. Briefly, specimens of the
sea cucumber Thelenota anax were collected at the Great
Barrier Reef area, Australia, in September 1988, and were
cut and extracted with ethanol at room temperature over 1
week. The extract was lyophilized, dissolved in water, and
loaded onto a column with Teflon powder (Polychrom-1,
Biolar, Latvia). Before use, the column was filled with
the sorbent in alcohol and washed with water. After salts

and polar impurities were washed off with water, the
crude glycoside fraction was eluted with a 1:1 mixture of
acetone and water. The obtained eluate was concentrated
by vacuum drying. The crude glycoside fraction was
separated by repeated chromatography on a column with
Si gel using chloroform – methanol – water (75:25:1) to
yield STD. The purity of STD was confirmed by direct
comparison of 1H and 13C NMR spectra and physical
constants, as well as by TLC on silica gel plates against a
standard sample of the glycoside isolated from Stichopus
chloronotus.
For experiments, STD was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). Annexin V was from BD Biosciences
Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA). Anti-procaspase-8, antiprocaspase-3, anti-procaspase-9, anti-CerS4, anti-CerS5,
and anti-cytochrome c antibodies were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Antibodies against poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP), p38 kinase, p-p38 kinase, JNK, p-JNK, Erk1/2,
p-Erk1/2, Smac/DIABLO, and cytochrome oxidase
IV (COX IV) were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). The anti-CerS6
antibody was from Biorbyt (San Francisco, CA). The
anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO, USA). Unless stated otherwise, all other chemicals
were purchased from Sigma.

To evaluate the effect of STD on HL-60 and K562
cell growth, cell viability was determined using the
[3-(4, 5)-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. In brief, cells were seeded onto
a 96-well plate (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA)
at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells/well in a volume of
200 μl. The cells were incubated with STD at several
concentrations for 24 h. After incubation for the indicated
times, 20 μl MTT (Sigma, USA) solution (5 mg/ml
in PBS) was added to each well, and the plates were
incubated for an additional 4 h at 37°C. Next, the MTT
solution in the medium was aspirated off. To dissolve the
formazan crystals formed in viable cells, 100 μl DMSO
was added to each well before the absorbance at 570 nm
was measured. Chemosensitivity values were expressed
as percent cell viability of the drug concentration that
inhibited 50% cell growth. IC50 values were calculated
from the concentration-effect relationships using CalcuSyn
software (Biosoft, Version 2.0, Cambridge, UK).

The mixture was added to an electroporation cuvette
(0.4-cm electrode gap) and subjected to 300 V and 950 μF
(Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporation System; Bio-Rad,
Richmond, CA, USA). After electroporation, cells were
cultured in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI1640 for 48 h,
then treated with 0.1% DMSO or STD for indicated
times. Next, these cells were used for annexin-V staining,
immunofluorescence analysis, and Western blot analysis.

Variations in mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP; Djm) during the induction of apoptosis were
examined with DiOC6 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR),
as previously described [32].

Separation of the cytosolic and mitochondrial
proteins
Cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins were separated
as previously described [33]. Briefly, cells treated with
0.1% DMSO or with STD for indicated times were
collected and resuspended in mitochondrial isolation buffer
and protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim)
supplemented with 10 μM digitonin. Suspensions were
incubated at 37°C for 5 min and centrifuged at 12, 000 g for
15 min. The supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was collected
for Western blotting. The pellets were resuspended in RIPA
buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail, incubated at 4°C
for 30 min with vortexing, and centrifuged at 15, 000 rpm
for 30 min. The supernatant (mitochondrial fraction) was
collected for Western blotting.

Western blot analysis
Cell lysis and Western blot analysis were performed
as described previously [32]. Thirty micrograms of protein
were used for immunoblotting, with β-actin as the loading
control. Bands were quantified using Image Studio Lite
Ver 3.1.

Generation of a CerS6-silenced K562 cell line
A shRNA construct containing CerS6 shRNA
[MISSION® shRNA plasmid DNA (CerS6-pLKO.1puro)] and non-targeting control construct NCpLKO.1-puro were provided by Sigma (St. Louis,
MO, USA). The CerS6 shRNA sequences were

GTAAGACCAGAAGCAGTTCTTTTTG-3′ and 5′-CCGG
CGGACGAACTAGGTGTTTAATCTCGAGATTAAACA
CCTAGTTCGTCCGTTTTTTG-3. The NC shRNA
sequence was 5-GCGCGATAGCGCTAATAATTT-3′.
K562 cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of CerS6pLKO.1-puro or NC-pLKO.1-puro using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), following the
manufacturer’s recommended procedure. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, the cells were selected with
2 μg/mL puromycin for 14 days to obtain stable clones, and
positive clones were picked for identification. Stable cell
lines were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with
10% FBS, 2 μg/ml puromycin, 100 U/ml penicillin, and
100 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). Cultures were maintained
in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 at 37°C.

Immunofluorescence staining
Cells were fixed and permeabilized with 1%
formaldehyde/methanol in PBS for 10 min at room
temperature. After the cells were washed, primary antibodies
were applied as indicated, followed by PE-conjugated goat
anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (IgG;
Calbiochem, San Diego, CA); Alexa 488-labeled cholera
toxin B antibody was used as a raft marker. Next, samples
were mounted in glycerol and analyzed using confocal
microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood,
NY) with a 40× C-Apochromat objective. Negative control
staining was performed with secondary antibodies alone.

K562 cells (1.5 × 107/100 μl PBS per mouse) and
HL-60 cells (2 × 107/100 μl PBS per mouse), as confirmed
by trypan blue staining, were injected into the right flank of
6-week-old female Balb/c nude mice (n = 5 mice per group;
Orient Bio Inc., Korea), as previously described [10]. To
confirm the essential role of CerS6 in the antitumor activity
of STD in vivo, K562 cells expressing NC construct (1.5 ×
107/100 μl PBS per mouse) and K562 cells expressing two
kinds of CerS6 shRNA (1.5 × 107/100 μl PBS per mouse)
were injected into the right flank of 6-week-old female
Balb/c nude mice (n = 5 mice per group; Orient Bio Inc.,
Korea). When the average subcutaneous tumor volume
reached 60–100 mm3, mice were assigned to one of two
treatment groups (Control and STD). Mice in the STD
group received 21.79 μg/kg STD via tail vein every 3 days.
Control mice were treated with vehicle only. Tumor size
was measured with a caliper (calculated volume=shortest
diameter2 × longest diameter/2). Mice were followed for
tumor size and body weight, and were sacrificed on the 14th
or 21st day. Tumors were resected, weighed, and frozen or
fixed in formalin and paraffin embedded for Western blot or
immunohistochemical studies.

Conventional karyotyping
Conventional chromosome analysis was performed
on G-banded metaphase cells prepared from unstimulated
bone marrow aspirate cultures (24 and 48 hours) using
standard techniques. Twenty metaphases were analyzed,
and the results were reported using the International
System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature
(2013) [34].

Analysis of combined drug effects
We used the isobologram and combination index
(CI) methods (derived from the median effect principle
of Chou and Talalay [17]) and CalcuSyn software version
2.0 (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) to analyze synergistic
drug effects. Data obtained from the growth inhibition
experiments were used to perform these analyses. We
studied the isobologram analysis of STD with etoposide
and Ara-C using the computer software. The CI method is
an analysis of the combined effects of two drugs using a
median effect plot analysis. A CI < 1 indicates a synergistic
effect; a CI value of 1 indicates an additive effect; and a CI
value > 1 indicates an antagonistic effect.

Histology and immunohistochemical analysis
Tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin/
eosin, and immunohistochemistry was performed
as follows using the Discovery XT automated
immunohistochemistry stainer (Ventana Medical
Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA). Tissue sections
were deparaffinized using EZ Prep solution (Ventana
Medical Systems). For antigen retrieval, CCl standard
(pH 8.4 buffer contained Tris/Borate/EDTA, [Ventana
Medical Systems]) was used for 45 min with anticeramide antibody, 24 min with anti-CerS6 antibody,
45 min with anti-p-p38 antibody, and 60 min with
anti-p38 antibody. Slides were treated with Inhibitor D
(3% H2O2, endogenous peroxidase, [Ventana Medical
Systems]) for 4 min at 37°C. Slides were incubated
with anti-ceramide antibody (Enzo Life Sciences Inc.,
PA, USA; dilution, 1:10) for 1 h, anti-CerS6 antibody
(Biorbyt Limited, Cambridge, UK; dilution, 1:200) for
30 min, anti-p-p38 antibody (Cell signaling technology,
Inc., MA, USA; dilution, 1:50) for 1 h, and anti-p38
antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank,
Iowa City, Iowa; dilution, 1:50) for 2 h at 37°C. Next,
slides were treated with Dako REAL™ Envision™ antirabbit/mouse HRP (Dako) secondary antibody at 37°C
for 8 min versus anti-ceramide antibody, anti-CerS6
antibody, and anti-p-p38 antibody; and for 16 min versus
anti-p38 antibody. Slides were incubated in DAB+ H2O2
substrate using the Ventana Chromo Map Kit (Ventana
Medical Systems) for 8 min, followed by hematoxylin/
eosin counterstaining. Sections were washed with

determine whether there were significant differences
in cell viability between STD-treated and control cells.
Differences in tumor volume between treated and control
groups were evaluated using Student’s unpaired t-test.
Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
