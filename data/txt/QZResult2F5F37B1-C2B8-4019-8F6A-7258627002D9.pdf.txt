Abstract
Cancer cells are defined by their ability to invade through the basement membrane, a critical step during
metastasis. While increased secretion of proteases, which facilitates degradation of the basement membrane,
and alterations in the cytoskeletal architecture of cancer cells have been previously studied, the contribution
of the mechanical properties of cells in invasion is unclear. Here, we applied a magnetic tweezer system to
establish that stiffness of patient tumor cells and cancer cell lines inversely correlates with migration and
invasion through three-dimensional basement membranes, a correlation known as a power law. We found that
cancer cells with the highest migratory and invasive potential are five times less stiff than cells with the lowest
migration and invasion potential. Moreover, decreasing cell stiffness by pharmacologic inhibition of myosin II
increases invasiveness, whereas increasing cell stiffness by restoring expression of the metastasis suppressor
TbRIII/betaglycan decreases invasiveness. These findings are the first demonstration of the power-law relation
between the stiffness and the invasiveness of cancer cells and show that mechanical phenotypes can be used to
grade the metastatic potential of cell populations with the potential for single cell grading. The measurement of a
mechanical phenotype, taking minutes rather than hours needed for invasion assays, is promising as a
quantitative diagnostic method and as a discovery tool for therapeutics. By showing that altering stiffness
predictably alters invasiveness, our results indicate that pathways regulating these mechanical phenotypes are
novel targets for molecular therapy of cancer. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5075–80. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The spread of cancer from its primary site to distant organs,
the "invasion-metastasis cascade," is the main cause of cancer
death and invasion of cells into the lymphatics and blood
vessels is a crucial step in metastasis, correlating with a poorer
patient prognosis (1). Hallmarks of invasion include secretion
of proteases, alterations in adhesion receptors, and changes in
cell morphologic and migratory properties (2). Drugs targeting
the metastatic cascade, including the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), which degrade the extracellular matrix, or the

migratory machinery, are being evaluated in clinical trials (3)
but results have been disappointing potentially because of the
complexity and redundancy of the metastatic cascade.
Cell stiffness has been postulated to play roles in transmigration of cancer cells through a basement membrane (4). A
variety of biophysical techniques including membrane
stretching, atomic force microscopy, optical traps, and micropipette aspiration have been used to probe the mechanical
properties of cells (5). These techniques use ferromagnetic or
superparamagnetic beads to attach to membrane receptors
and are followed by application of either a twisting or a pulling
motion to the bead and thus to the cell via an electromagnet
(6). Magnetic tweezers, like the one described here, provides
for a wide range of force magnitudes (10 pN–10 nN), the ability
to probe individual cells and to conduct measurements in
minutes to understand the time-dependent development
mechanical state of a cell (7). While cancer tissue has been
found to be generally stiffer than normal tissue, recent studies
have shown that cancer cells themselves are more compliant
than normal cells (8). However, the extent of the correlation
between mechanical properties and specific aspects of cancer
progression has not been determined. Specifically, whether
modification of cell stiffness might alter key aspects of metastasis such as invasion is unclear. The measurement of metastatic potential through 2-dimensional substrates (migration;
movement through membrane pores) and 3-dimensional (3D)
motion through tissue matrix material (invasion) are common
assays used in cancer cell biology and applied as population

studies over longer time durations. Therefore, it is of broad
interest from an analytical, diagnostic, and cancer biology
context to understand how a mechanical phenotype measure
could be utilized relative to current metastatic potential
assays. To address these questions, we have used a magnetic
tweezer system in parallel with Matrigel invasion assays to
examine the specific correlation between mechanical properties of cancer cells and their metastatic potential, specifically
their invasive potential.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
Human ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCA429, IGROV, SKOV3,
HEY, DOV13, OV2008, and Ovca420 and ovarian cancer stable
cells lines, Ovca429Neo, Ovca429TbRIII were cultured, and
TbRIII were cultured, derived, and characterized as previously
described (9). Antibody to phosphorylated myosin light chain
(pMLC) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (catalogue no. 3671) and pan-cytokeratin antibody was obtained from
Santa Cruz (catalogue no. 81714).
Isolation of cancer cells from ascites
Primary short-term epithelial ovarian cancer cell cultures
were established from the ascites of patients with stage III or
IV epithelial ovarian cancer as described previously (10). Cells
were seeded and grown on 10 mg/mL fibronectin-coated
culture dishes in Roswell Park Memorial Institute media
containing 20% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution
at 37 C in 5% CO2. Adhered cells were subject to limited
dispase digestion for the first passage to remove fibroblasts
and stained with a pan-cytokeratin antibody to confirm
epithelial origin.
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence was conducted essentially as
described previously (9) and images were obtained using a
Nikon inverted microscope.
Matrigel invasion and transwell migration assays
Cancer cells were seeded at a cell density of 25,000 to 70,000
on either Matrigel-coated or uncoated filters and allowed to
invade for 18 to 24 hours toward 10% FBS in the lower
chamber. Cells invading and migrating through the Matrigel
layer were visualized and counted as described (9). Percent
cell migration or invasion was determined as the fraction of
total cells that invaded through the filter. Blebbistatin
(100 mM; ref. 10) was added to the top chamber of the
transwell and migration and invasion allowed to proceed.
Each assay was set up in duplicate, and each experiment was
conducted at least 3 times with 4 random fields from a 10
magnification analyzed for each membrane.
Magnetic tweezers assay
The 3D force microscope (3DFM; ref. 11) was used for
applying controlled and precise 60 to 100 pN local force
(Supplementary Fig. S1) on 2.8 mm magnetic beads (DYNAL
Biotech) coated with fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich). Briefly,

cells were plated on coverslips followed by addition of the
beads. Cells and beads were incubated for 30 minutes
followed by force application and resultant bead displacements were recorded and analyzed. The displacement of the
beads was recorded with high-speed video camera (JAI
Pulnix) and tracked using Video Spot Tracker (http://
cismm.cs.unc.edu). The mean creep compliance was calculated from the tracked displacements as described. Spring
constants were derived by fitting the compliance curves to a
Jeffrey's model for viscoelastic liquids (Supplementary
Fig. S1). For pharmacologic experiments, blebbistatin
(100 mM) was added to the cells for 30 minutes, before
addition of the beads and the reagent left in for the remainder of the experiment.

Results and Discussion
The invasiveness and migratory capacity of a panel of
ovarian cancer cell lines and primary cells derived from ascites
of patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer was determined by using transwell assays in the presence or absence of
reconstituted Matrigel (Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Fig. S2). Although both ovarian cancer cell lines and
primary cancer cells were able to invade through Matrigel, the
degree of invasiveness varied widely among individual lines,
with the most invasive and migratory cell line, HEY, being 2
orders of magnitude more invasive (IHEY ¼ 0.85%, IIGROV ¼
0.006%) than the least migratory and invasive cell line, IGROV
(Fig. 1A). Similarly, while primary cells were obtained from
patients at either stage III or stage IV disease (Supplementary
Table S1), the most invasive primary cell line, OV207, was an
order of magnitude more invasive than the least invasive
primary cell line, OV445 (Fig. 1B; IOV207 ¼ 0.193%, IOV445 ¼
0.006%). Mechanical properties of the cancer cells from the
same passage as used for invasion studies were determined in
parallel by using a 3DFM-based magnetic tweezer system (11).
The creep compliance (deformability) was calculated as the
average time-dependent deformation normalized by the constant stress applied (Jmax ¼ rmaxF 6pa, where a is the radius of
the bead and rmax is maximum bead displacement). We find
that the most invasive cell line, HEY, was 10 times more
deformable than the least invasive cell line, IGROV. In addition, OV207 that exhibited 30-fold greater invasion than
OV445, had a Jmax ¼ 3.1 Pa1 in contrast with the Jmax ¼
0.3 Pa1 observed for OV445 (Fig. 1C and D). Hence, both cell
lines and primary cells that exhibited high invasive behavior
also presented high Jmax values and were more compliant. To
further examine the relationship between cancer cell deformability and invasive potential, the effective shear modulus
(here on referred to as the stiffness, k) of the cell was
calculated by fitting a modified Kelvin–Voigt model (12) to
the compliance using a least squares fit (see Supplementary
Materials). The cancer cell lines and primary cells were
classified both by their stiffness and their invasiveness, with
both parameters falling into 3 classes of low, medium, and
high stiffness or invasiveness, respectively. Cell lines within a
given class did not exhibit statistically significant differences
in their stiffness, whereas cell lines between classes, were

findings, the distribution of all stiffness values for the less
invasive cell line (IGROV) showed a log normal distribution
whereas the highly invasive cell line (SKOV3) showed a normal
distribution (Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 8). Scaling the cell line
and primary cell correlations separately with their respective
highest cell stiffness values resulted in a single parameter
power law (Fig. 2D). A similar correlation and power law was
also observed for stiffness and cell migration (Supplementary

cell stiffness of cancer cells either from body fluids or tumors
(13), our data using ovarian cancer cell lines and cells from
patient ascites show that cancer cells across a given disease
population exhibit a varying degree of stiffness, a phenomenon
previously not described. In addition, the variability in stiffness correlates directly with a specific measure of metastatic
progression as determined by using in vitro 3D invasion assays.

(Fig. 3A and B), high E-cadherin expression and low vimentin
expression (Supplementary Fig. S5), they exhibited a 1.7-fold
difference in stiffness, which corresponded to a 4-fold difference in invasion (Figs. 1 and 2). These data show that cell
stiffness measurements conducted as described may be a
more discerning measurement of metastatic potential than
examining cell structure or epithelial character.
To investigate the role of stiffness as impacted by the
cytoskeleton on migration and invasion, we determined the
effect of altering actomyosin contractility on these properties. Because cells with differential invasiveness (IGROV vs.
HEY) had distinct pMLC localization and cytoskeletal architecture (Fig. 3), we used blebbistatin, a myosin II inhibitor on
the stiffest cell line (IGROV) and examined the effect on cell
stiffness, migration, and invasion. Blebbistatin, at a concentration that disrupted cortical pMLC localization but did not
affect viability, increased cell invasion by 2.5-fold, cell migration by 4-fold, and decreased cell stiffness by 2-fold (Fig. 4C
and D). We also observed concomitant alterations in the
actin cytoskeleton of IGROV cells (Supplementary Fig. S3),
supporting a relationship between actomyosin contractility,
cell stiffness, and invasion of cancer cells. Another factor
implicated in regulating migration and invasion either via

Stiffness and deformation are strongly regulated by actomyosin contractility (14, 15). Phosphorylation of the 20-kD
regulatory MLC subunit on the Ser19 (mono) or on Ser19/
Thr18 (di; ref. 16) has been shown to promote cell contractility
via changes in the actin myosin network (17). Visualization of
actin in the stiffest and least invasive cell line, IGROV, revealed
strong cortical actin staining with little to no cell protrusions
or lamellipodial structures (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the compliant
and invasive cell lines, including SKOV3 and HEY cells,
exhibited distinct lamellipodial and protrusive structures with
limited cortical actin. In addition, pMLC was found distinctly
along the cell periphery in IGROV (Fig. 3B) whereas SKOV3
and HEY cells had little to no peripheral pMLC localization.
This phenotypic difference between the stiffest/least invasive
and the compliant/most invasive cell lines might reflect
differences in epithelial character of the cells. Accordingly,
we examined the expression of an epithelial marker (E-cadherin) and a mesenchymal marker (vimentin) in these cell
lines. Indeed, the stiffest/least invasive cell lines expressed
more E-cadherin and less vimentin, whereas the compliant/
most invasive cell lines expressed less E-cadherin and more
vimentin (Supplementary Fig. S5). Intriguingly, while the
Ovca420 and IGROV cells both exhibited high cortical actin

the cytoskeleton or via secretion of proteases like MMPs is
TGF-b (18). Early in carcinogenesis tumors become resistant
to the homeostatic effects of TGF-b. One of the proposed
mechanisms is loss of expression of the type III TGF-b
receptor (TbRIII), which has been shown in a number of
human cancers, including cancers of the breast, lung, ovary,
pancreas, and prostate (reviewed in ref. 18). TbRIII has been
shown to regulate cancer cell motility via alterations in the
actin cytoskeleton (9). To further investigate the contribution of the cytoskeleton and stiffness on cancer cell invasion,
we examined the effect of TbRIII expression on cancer cell
stiffness using stable cell lines Ovca429Neo (no TbRIII
expression), and Ovca429TbRIII (TbRIII expression restored;
ref. 9). We found that Ovca429TbRIII cells were 2-fold stiffer
than Ovca429Neo cells (Kovca429TbRIII ¼ 2.9 Pa, KOvca429Neo ¼
1.29 Pa; Fig. 4B). Furthermore, this increase in stiffness
corresponded to a decrease in invasiveness, similar to the
correlation observed in the cancer cell lines (Fig. 4A).
In addition, treating Ovca429TbRIII cells with blebbistatin
increased their invasiveness by 4-fold and decreased the
stiffness by 2-fold (Kovca429TbRIII-blebbistatin ¼ 1.48 Pa,
Iovca429TbRIII-blebbistatin ¼ 0.04%) similar to effects seen with
blebbistatin treatment of the stiffest ovarian cancer cell line,
IGROV (Fig. 4C and D). Hence, cytoskeletal stiffness and
effects on myosin II function may mediate suppression of
migration and invasion by TbRIII.
Our results are the first evidence that metastatic potential
measured through cancer cell invasion shows an inverse
power-law relationship with cell stiffness. The particular
exponent we derive may depend on the methodology
employed for mechanical property determination. As cancer
cells get progressively more invasive, they display softer
mechanical characteristics that result in cell deformation
and shape changes suitable for a metastatic population. We
also find that cell lines having similar cytomorphology and

cells from patients with similar stage disease can have
widely different invasive potential that correlates with differences in stiffness. Currently, cell-based diagnoses in cancer rely on histology examination of the removed tissue
sample through antibody labeling of specific markers. This
complex process is not always reliable and lacks quantified
assessment of the disease state. Hence, sensitive biophysical
measurements such as those shown here, can be done in
short periods of time, on samples obtained from either
ascites or circulating cells, providing potentially unique
information about the patient's cancer including metastatic
potential. Application of more sophisticated models to
quantify scale-free cell mechanics will provide further
insight into this relationship (19, 20). These insights into
biomechanical changes during cancer progression have the
potential to lead to novel therapy for treatments. Our
observation that the relationship between invasiveness
and stiffness is maintained across a series of cancer cell
lines, in patient tumor specimens, and under cell biochemical modifications that increase and decrease cell stiffness,
suggests that magnetic bead assays for stiffness may be an
clinically applicable predictor of invasive potential, and that
treatments that affect cellular stiffness, independent of
mechanism, may be useful antimetastatic approaches.
