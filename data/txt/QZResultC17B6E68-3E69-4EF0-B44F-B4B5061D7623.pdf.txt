Abstract
Genome-wide copy number analyses of human cancers identified a frequent 5p13 amplification in
multiple solid tumor types, including lung (56%), ovarian (38%), breast (32%), prostate (37%) and
melanoma (32%). Integrative analysis of the region identifies a Golgi protein, GOLPH3, as a
candidate targeted for amplification. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo
validated GOLPH3 as a potent oncogene. Physically, GOLPH3 localizes to the trans-Golgi
network and interacts with components of the retromer complex, which in yeast has been linked to
TOR signaling. Mechanistically, GOLPH3 regulates cell size, enhances growth factor-induced
mTOR signaling in human cancer cells and alters response to mTOR inhibitor in vivo. Thus,
reinforcing genomic and genetic, biological, functional and biochemical data in yeast and humans

establish GOLPH3 as a novel oncogene that is commonly targeted for amplification in human
cancer and capable of modulating the response to rapamycin, a cancer drug in clinical use.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Cellular growth, proliferation and survival are regulated by a complex network of
intracellular and extracellular signal transduction cascades. The growth factor-responsive
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) - phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays a
major role in governing these processes1. The serine/threonine kinase AKT functions as a
central integrator of RTK-PI3K signaling to modulate downstream effectors, most notably
the TSC1/2-mTOR complexes. mTOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase and ‘target of
rapamycin’, serves as a primary regulator of protein synthesis and cell growth2. Genetic
studies in Drosophila and mice3;4;5;6 have shown that mTOR activity can influence cell
size, a key parameter governing entry into the cell cycle7. mTOR also integrates diverse
upstream signals that include amino acid and energy stress sensing to regulate cell
proliferation, growth and survival8;9. mTOR is present in two separate signaling complexes,
mTORC1 and mTORC2, which differ in subunit composition and their sensitivity to the
bacterial macrolide rapamycin. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR activity when bound to the
protein Raptor, leading to reduced cell growth, cell size and proliferation10;11;2.

A hallmark feature of human cancer is its highly rearranged genome, manifesting as
numerous copy number amplifications and deletions detectable by genome-wide array-based
comparative genome hybridization (array-CGH) profiling. Reasoning that genomic
alterations recurrent in different human cancer types are more likely to represent “driver”
events targeting cancer genes of broad biological and pathogenetic significance, we defined
a focal amplification within a larger 5p13 regional gain present at high frequencies in
multiple solid tumors that include melanoma, colon adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung
cancer. Integrative genomics combined with clinicopathological and functional validation
identified a Golgi-localizing protein, GOLPH3, as a novel oncogene targeted for
amplification at 5p13. Mechanistic studies utilizing both yeast and human systems linked
GOLPH3 to the retromer protein trafficking complex, mTOR signaling and the response to
rapamycin.

Results
GOLPH3 is a target of 5p13 amplification

Author Manuscript

Array-CGH analysis of 83 melanoma specimens revealed a focal amplification within a
larger 5p13 regional copy number gain, which was also present in non-small cell lung cancer
and colon adenocarcinomas (Fig. 1a), prompting a broad survey by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). Analysis on tumor tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 307 cores of
diverse tumor types showed that 5p13 gain was present significantly in all tumor types
surveyed, including 56% (27 of 48) of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cores, 38%
(18 of 48) of ovarian carcinoma cores, 37% (16 of 43) of prostate cancer cores as well as
32% (12 of 38) of melanoma cores (Fig. 1b, Supp Fig. S1 and Supp Table S1). Quantitative
real-time PCR across the 5p13 region in informative tumor samples delimited a 0.8 MB

minimal common region (MCR) encompassing four resident annotated genes (Fig. 1c, d).
Given that copy number aberration (CNA) is a mechanism to drive deregulated gene
expression, we next investigated the expression pattern of these resident genes in a NSCLC
collection with matched expression and array-CGH profiles. As shown in Fig. 1e, only
GOLPH3 and SUB1, but not MTMR12 and ZFR, showed statistically significant correlation
between expression level and copy number status, thereby pointing to GOLPH3 and SUB1
as viable candidate target(s) of this amplification.

Author Manuscript

To assess the cancer-relevance of GOLPH3, SUB1 or both, knockdown assays using pooled
siRNAs (Fig. 1f) were performed to gauge the dependence of human tumor (NSCLC and
melanoma) cell lines on either gene for their transformed phenotype relative to the
underlying copy number status and overall protein expression level (Supp Fig. S2a).
Knockdown of GOLPH3 resulted in significant loss of anchorage independent growth in
CRL-5889 (NSCLC), Sbcl2 and SK-MEL-5 (melanoma), three human cancer cell lines with
5p13 amplification and high expression level. However, a similar level of knockdown in
1205LU, a melanoma cell line without the 5p13 CNA and with low protein expression,
resulted in minimal effect on anchorage independence (Fig. 1f). In contrast, equally effective
knockdown of SUB1 in the 5p13-amplified tumor lines had either no or relatively modest
effects on anchorage independence.

Author Manuscript

To confirm that the observed knockdown activity was not due to an off-target effect of the
GOLPH3 siRNA, we deconvoluted the siRNA pool and verified that two of the four
independent siRNA duplexes (siRNAs #3 and #4) were effective at knocking down
GOLPH3 (Supp Fig. S2b), which led to potent suppression of soft agar growth and
inhibition of proliferation in 5p13-amplified CRL-5889 cells (Fig. 2a). Similarly effective
knockdown in 1205LU without 5p13 gain and low GOLPH3 expression showed minimal
effect, indicating that acute GOLPH3 depletion is not generally toxic to all cells (Fig. 2a and
Supp Fig. S2b). Importantly, specificity of siRNA#3 against GOLPH3 was further
documented by rescue of A459 proliferation by a GOLPH3 cDNA engineered to be
insensitive to siRNA#3 (siRES) (Fig. 2b). Together, these genetic loss-of-function studies
using RNAi-mediated knockdown pointed to GOLPH3 as the likely functionally active
target of this amplification.

Author Manuscript

We next examined the impact of ectopic GOLPH3 expression in a number of model
systems. GOLPH3 was capable of effecting malignant transformation of both primary nontransformed mouse and human cells. Specifically, in the classical co-transformation assay,
GOLPH3 cooperated with activated HRASV12 to increase transformed focus formation in
Ink4a/Arf- deficient primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (Fig. 2c; 3.4-fold increase
relative to HRASV12 alone). In primary human cells, GOLPH3 cooperated with oncogenic
BRAFV600E in TERT-immortalized human melanocytes (hereafter referred to as
“HMEL”)12 to confer anchorage independent growth in soft agar, whereas SUB1 showed
no transforming activity in this system (Fig. 2d). Similar activity was also observed in the
1205LU melanoma cell line (no 5p13 amplification, low GOLPH3 expression), wherein
GOLPH3 over-expression (Supp Fig. S2c) enhanced anchorage independent growth and cell
proliferation in vitro (Supp Fig. S2d and data not shown). Lastly, GOLPH3 over-expression
(Supp Fig. S2e-f) significantly enhanced xeno-transplanted tumor growth (Fig. 2e) of human

melanoma (WM239A) and NSCLC (A549) cell lines, both without 5p13 amplification. This
series of reinforcing knockdown and over-expression studies demonstrates that GOLPH3 is
a bona fide oncogene with potent transforming activity.
Yeast genetics links GOLPH3 to mTOR

Author Manuscript

GOLPH3 (alias GPP34; GMx33) was initially identified as a peripheral membrane protein
localized to the trans-Golgi Network (TGN)13;14. Subsequent work with the rat homolog,
GMx33, revealed that the protein is dynamically associated with the trans-Golgi matrix,
rapidly moving from the TGN to the cytosol with localization in endosomes and at the
plasma membrane15. As a class, TGN-localizing proteins have not been directly implicated
in cancer pathogenesis. Thus, we first confirmed by confocal microscopy that both
exogenously-expressed and endogenous human GOLPH3 indeed co-localized to the Golgi
apparatus via co-immunofluorescence with the TGN marker, TGN46, and to endosome-like
structures as described previously15 (Fig. 3a).
To gain mechanistic insights into the biological functions of GOLPH3, we screened for
GOLPH3-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system (Supp Information and
Supp Table S2). Most notable among the GOLPH3-interacting proteins was VPS35, a
highly conserved member of the cargo-recognition complex of the retromer, which regulates
retrograde transport of proteins that include transmembrane receptors from endosomes to the
TGN16. After documenting bait-dependent interaction of GOLPH3 with VPS35 in yeast
(Supp Fig. S3a-b), we showed physical interaction of VPS35 with both exogenouslyexpressed and endogenous GOLPH3 in human cells by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3b and
Supp Fig. S3c). Confocal co-immunofluorescence studies further confirmed co-localization
of endogenous VPS35 and GOLPH3 at endosome-like structures (Fig. 3c).

Author Manuscript

A large-scale chemical genomic profiling screen in S. cerevisiae17 has found that deletion
mutants of VPS35 and VPS29 exhibited altered sensitivity to rapamycin, an inhibitor of TOR
signaling, suggesting that the retromer complex might function in the TOR signaling
pathway in budding yeast. Thus, we postulated that GOLPH3 might regulate the mammalian
ortholog of TOR (mTOR) thereby contributing to the pro-tumorigenic effects of GOLPH3.
This hypothesis is supported by the observation that, in human NSCLC tumor specimens,
high 5p13 copy number was associated with increased mTOR expression and elevated
phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate, S6 Kinase (S6K) by AQUA® quantitative
immunofluorescence18 (Fig. 3d and Supp Tables S3-S4). Specifically, mTOR expression
level was associated with cytoplasmic, but not nuclear nor total, phospho-S6KThr389 (pS6K)
level (Pearson’s R=0.42, p=0.001). When the 5p13 copy number status was binarized into
normal (with FISH-determined signal <1.5) and gained (FISH signal >=1.5), a significant
correlation with increased mTOR (Spearman’s rho=0.475, p=0.04) and cytoplasmic pS6K
(Spearman’s rho=0.724, p<0.0001) was observed, signifying that 5p13 CNA is positively
correlated with mTOR-pS6K activity in the adenocarcinoma subtype of NSCLC.
Importantly, even when the 5p13 copy number was treated as a continuous variable,
significant correlation was still observed with cytoplasmic pS6K in this subtype of NSCLC
(Pearson’s R=0.513, p<0.025; Table S4). Taken together, this correlative relationship in

human cancers, coupled with the yeast genetic interaction data, supports the hypothesis that
GOLPH3 regulates mTOR activity in mammalian cells.
GOLPH3 activates mTOR signaling
To test the hypothesis that GOLPH3 activates mTOR signaling, we first examined the
biological consequences of GOLPH3 modulation. Consistent with mTOR’s role in cell size
regulation, RNAi-mediated GOLPH3 depletion led to a significant cell size reduction in
A549, an effect that was comparable to treatment with rapamycin19 (Fig. 4a). Next, we
assayed the biochemical consequences of GOLPH3 modulation.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Since the mTOR substrate S6K is a kinase effector of cell size that is phosphorylated at
Thr389 by mTOR20;21, we investigated phospho-S6K status as a readout of the mTORC1
axis. Consistent with the human tumor data showing elevated pS6K in 5p13 amplified
NSCLC specimens, GOLPH3 over-expression resulted in elevated pS6K in tumor cell lines
(1205LU and A549) as well as in HMEL-tet-GOLPH3, a TERT-immortalized human
melanocyte cell line engineered with a tet-regulated GOLPH3 expression construct (Fig.
4b). Substantiating these observations using the inducible system, GOLPH3 induction
further enhanced pS6K accumulation in response to growth factor stimulation by epidermal
growth factor (EGF; Fig. 4c). At the same time, we monitored phosphorylation of AKT
(pAKT) at Ser473, a direct substrate of mTORC222;23. Similar to mTORC1-mediated
phosphorylation of S6K, we observed a comparable increase in pAKT phosphorylation in
GOLPH3 over-expressing cells (Fig. 4b), suggesting that GOLPH3 can enhance signaling
through both mTOR-associated complexes. Moreover, AKT and S6K phosphorylation was
significantly abrogated in siGOLPH3-treated NSCLC A549 and CRL-5889 cells compared
to control cells in response to EGF (Fig. 4d-e). Additional biochemical analyses showed
altered phosphorylation of the mTOR substrates S6KThr389, p4E-BP1Thr37/46 and AKTSer473
with little to no affect on other signaling proteins including PTEN, MEK1/2 and p44/42
(Erk1/2) among others (Supp Fig. S4). Collectively, these data provided strong biochemical
evidence that GOLPH3 activates mTOR signaling through phosphorylation of both
mTORC1- and mTORC2-specific substrates.
GOLPH3 modulates rapamycin sensitivity

Author Manuscript

Complementing the genetic studies above, we next asked whether GOLPH3 expression
levels affect tumor cell sensitivity to pharmacological mTOR inhibition in vivo. Here, we
selected two human melanoma cells, 1205LU and WM239A, based on their normal
GOLPH3 copy-number and low protein expression as well as their ability to readily form
subcutaneous (SQ) tumors in vivo. Parental cells were engineered to stably express either
empty vector (EV) or GOLPH3 for orthotopic subcutaneous transplantation into
immunodeficient animals for tumor growth. Next, we compared the degree of tumor growth
inhibition (%TGI) in GOLPH3-expressing versus EV-control tumors upon rapamycin
treatment.
Consistent with above (Fig. 2e), 1205LU-GOLPH3 cells exhibited a significant growth
advantage compared to 1205LU-EV control cells in vivo (1.9-fold increase in tumor volume
at 36 days post-injection in vehicle control cohort, p-value=0.0148). Upon tumors reaching a

baseline volume of ~100 mm3, the animals were randomized into control and treatment
cohorts for intraperitoneal injection of either vehicle or rapamycin (6.0 mg/kg) every other
day. The treatment trial was terminated when one animal in any cohort had to be sacrificed
for tumor burden according to IACUC regulations. The inhibitory effect of rapamycin on
mTOR activity of treated tumors was verified by Western analysis (Supp Fig. S2g). The
efficacy of rapamycin treatment was then calculated as %TGI of treated versus non-treated
cohorts after 4 doses (day 8 of trial) for WM239A and 6 doses (day 12 of trial) for 1205LU.
Indeed, GOLPH3-expressing tumors were significantly more sensitive to rapamycin in vivo
(Fig. 5a-c and Supp Fig. S5). Therefore, we conclude that GOLPH3’s biochemical effect on
mTOR signaling is a critical aspect of its oncogenic function, as inhibition by rapamycin
effectively blocked the growth advantage conferred by GOLPH3 in vivo.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In this study, integrative analyses of genome-wide copy number and expression data coupled
with reinforcing knockdown and over-expression assays in vitro and in vivo led to the
identification of GOLPH3 as a bona fide oncoprotein frequently targeted for copy number
gain/amplification in diverse human cancers. A suspect role for the Golgi apparatus in
regulating cancer-relevant signaling has been speculated based on observation that some
cytoplasmic membrane oncoproteins, such as RAS, can functionally signal when temporally
present at the Golgi apparatus24. However, proteins such as GOLPH3 that are
predominantly localized to the TGN have not been directly linked on a genetic level to
cancer; therefore, GOLPH3 represents a first-in-class Golgi oncoprotein. Mechanistically,
we show that enhanced activation of mTOR signaling represents a molecular basis for
GOLPH3’s oncogenic activity. In this light, enhanced and sustained mTOR activation in
vivo would be expected to confer a significant growth advantage to cancer cells, a likely
basis for increased GOLPH3 gene copy number or expression in a large fraction of human
cancers.

Author Manuscript

Although we show through genetic and pharmacological studies that activation of mTOR is
essential for GOLPH3’s tumorigenicity, the precise structural and biochemical basis for
GOLPH3’s activity remains to be fully elucidated. Our molecular data on the physical
interaction between GOLPH3 and the retromer complex, which is responsible for protein
trafficking between endosomes and the TGN16, for the first time genetically implicates this
biological process in cancer. This is consistent with recent reports on the essential role of the
retromer and retrograde transport in regulation of the Wntless receptor and proper secretion
of the WNT morphogen25, which is important in both normal and neoplastic development.
Along the same line, depletion of VPS35 in Drosophila inhibited endocytosis of RTKs with
concomitant alterations in downstream signaling26. Taken together, these data raise the
possibility that GOLPH3 might function with VPS35 and the retromer to regulate receptor
recycling of key molecules thereby influencing downstream signaling through mTOR.
It has recently been discovered that Vps74, the yeast homolog of GOLPH3, is required for
proper docking and localization of glycosyltransferases to the Golgi apparatus27;28. Protein
glycosylation is one of the most prevalent forms of post-translational modification, and
altered glycosylation is a hallmark feature of cancers29. It is noteworthy that glycosylation

is known to be important for growth factor-activation of transmembrane receptors, since
glycosylation mediates receptor sorting, ligand binding and endocytosis29;30. Thus, it is
plausible that human GOLPH3 might serve a similar function in glycosyltransferase docking
as in S. cerevisiae and therefore might influence the downstream mTOR signaling response
through its effect on membrane RTKs.

Author Manuscript

The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling cascade is activated in nearly all cancers and hence
represents an intense focus for cancer drug development. However, the clinical response to
rapamycin and its analogs has been feeble11. Our demonstration of GOLPH3’s role in
activating mTOR signaling and conferring increased sensitivity to rapamycin in preclinical
setting raises the possibility that GOLPH3 expression level or copy number status may
predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors. Indeed, endpoint analysis of our preclinical treatment
studies showed that rapamycin was significantly more effective against xenograft tumors
expressing high level of GOLPH3 (p = 0.0268; 1205LU-GOLPH3 vs. 1205LU-EV tumor
volumes at endpoint; Supp Fig. S5b), thereby suggesting that GOLPH3 levels may be a
positive predictor of rapamycin sensitivity. Although the predictive value of GOLPH3 as a
biomarker remains to be demonstrated, the formulation of this hypothesis highlights the
importance of mechanistic insights beyond functional and clinicopathological validation in
the translation of cancer genomics.

METHODS SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Array-CGH profiles of melanoma, NSCLC and colon adenocarcinoma were analyzed as
previously described31. FISH analyses on TMAs of 9 tumor types using 5p13 and CEP1
centromeric probes determined frequency of copy number gain. Real-time quantitative
genomic PCR in informative samples containing the 5p13 CNA defined an MCR containing
4 genes, and integration with NSCLC tumor and cell line transcriptome profiles identified
MCR-resident genes with copy number correlated expression patterns. Oncogenic activity
was assayed by in vitro (proliferation, MEF transformation, and anchorage independent
growth in soft agar) and in vivo (subcutaneous tumor growth) through loss-of-function (by
RNAi targeting GOLPH3) and gain-of-function (by over-expression of GOLPH3) in
primary (MEF, HMEL) and transformed mouse and human cells. The yeast 2-hybrid screen
was performed using a human cDNA brain library with a GOLPH3 bait construct. Serumand EGF-induced mTOR and AKT activity was measured with pS6KThr389 and pAKTSer473
as readout by Western blotting. Total mTOR and pS6KThr389 were used to quantitate
relative protein expression level on tumor tissue microarrays by AQUA® to correlate
expression with copy number status determined by FISH. Rapamycin sensitivity was
determined by drug treatment in in vivo xenograft assays.

Figure 5. The in vivo GOLPH3 growth advantage is abrogated by treatment with rapamycin

Author Manuscript

a, b Mice harboring tumors of the melanoma cell lines a, WM239A and b, 1205LU
transduced with empty vector (EV; left panels) or GOLPH3 (right panels) were treated with
vehicle or rapamycin (6.0 mg/kg) at two-day increments following treatment onset (tumor
baseline volume ~100 mm3). Growth curves plotted as mean change in tumor volume
relative to baseline starting volume for each group. Bars indicate ±S.E.M. for biological
replicates. %TGI = percent tumor growth inhibition at time course endpoint. c, Table
summarizing data from the rapamycin treatment xenograft studies in Fig. 5a at the same
time point (day 8, post 4 doses). Veh=vehicle; Rap=rapamycin; %TGI = percent tumor
growth inhibition. Note 1205LU-GOLPH3 tumors treated with vehicle grew 2.5X in size
during the 8 days of treatment. In comparison, WM239A-GOLPH3 tumors grew 5.8X in
size during the same period of 8 days. The %TGI in these two cohorts of tumors was similar,
at 81.9% and 80.9% respectively, indicating that growth rate did not impact on the response
to rapamycin.
