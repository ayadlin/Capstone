Abstract
Drugs that inhibit insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGFI) receptor IGFIR were encouraging in early trials, but
predictive biomarkers were lacking and the drugs provided insufﬁcient beneﬁt in unselected patients. In this
study, we used genetic screening and downstream validation to identify the WNT pathway element DVL3 as a
mediator of resistance to IGFIR inhibition. Sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition was enhanced speciﬁcally in vitro and in
vivo by genetic or pharmacologic blockade of DVL3. In breast and prostate cancer cells, sensitization tracked with
enhanced MEK–ERK activation and relied upon MEK activity and DVL3 expression. Mechanistic investigations
showed that DVL3 is present in an adaptor complex that links IGFIR to RAS, which includes Shc, growth factor
receptor–bound-2 (Grb2), son-of-sevenless (SOS), and the tumor suppressor DAB2. Dual DVL and DAB2 blockade
synergized in activating ERKs and sensitizing cells to IGFIR inhibition, suggesting a nonredundant role for DVL3
in the Shc–Grb2–SOS complex. Clinically, tumors that responded to IGFIR inhibition contained relatively lower
levels of DVL3 protein than resistant tumors, and DVL3 levels in tumors correlated inversely with progression-free
survival in patients treated with IGFIR antibodies. Because IGFIR does not contain activating mutations
analogous to EGFR variants associated with response to EGFR inhibitors, we suggest that IGF signaling achieves
an equivalent integration at the postreceptor level through adaptor protein complexes, inﬂuencing cellular
dependence on the IGF axis and identifying a patient population with potential to beneﬁt from IGFIR inhibition.

Introduction
Type 1 insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFIR)
signals via recruitment of adaptors, including insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Shc, to drive proliferation, invasion, and cell survival (1). In the clinical and experimental
setting, low IGF bioactivity protects from tumor development and metastasis, suggesting that IGFs provide a potent
protumorigenic signal (2, 3). In early clinical trials, IGFIR
inhibitory drugs induced objective regressions, some dramatic and durable, as monotherapy in Ewing sarcomas and
other uncommon tumors, and with chemotherapy or targeted agents in common cancers (4–9). However, these
encouraging early reports have not translated to phase III
beneﬁt in unselected patients (10). Clearly, a better understanding of IGFIR biology is required if this therapeutic
approach is to be successful. Key priorities are to understand
what makes tumors resistant to IGFIR inhibition, use this
information to target these drugs to potentially responsive
patients, and select rational treatment combinations for
clinical testing. To address these issues, we used genetic
screening and downstream validation to identify novel
determinants of resistance to an IGFIR antagonist.

DVL3 Mediates Resistance to IGFIR Inhibition

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
DU145, PC3, LNCaP, and LNCaP-LN3 prostate cancer and
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were
from Cancer Research UK Cell Services (Clare Hall Laboratories),
22Rv1 prostate cancer cells from the ATCC, and BT20 and BT549
from Dr. Anthony Kong, University of Oxford, Oxford, United
Kingdom. All cell lines were mycoplasma-free when tested with
MycoAlert (Lonza Rockland Inc.). AZ12253801 and geﬁtinib were
provided by AstraZeneca, DVL-PDZ inhibitor II (DVLi) purchased from Calbiochem, and BMS-754807, XAV939, and
AZD6244 from Selleck Chemicals. DVL3 cDNA (Addgene) was
ampliﬁed using primers 50 -GGATCCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGA-30 and 50 -CTCGAGTCACATCACATCCACAAAGAACT-30 incorporating BamH1 and Xho1 sites, respectively
(underlined), digested with BamH1 and Xho1 (New England
Biolabs), cloned into BamHI-XhoI–digested pHRSIN-CSGW
HIV vector, and after veriﬁcation of the insert by DNA
sequencing, used for virus production as described (11).
Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and pulldown
assays were performed using reagents described in ref. 12,
Supplementary Methods, and Supplementary Table S1.
siRNA screens
Screens were performed as described previously (13 and
14), using kinase siRNA library (siARRAY, targeting 779
known and putative human protein kinases; Dharmacon)
containing SMARTPools of four siRNAs targeting each transcript, and human DNA Repair siRNA Set V1.0 siRNA library
(Qiagen), together with siPLK1 and Allstars siRNA as positive and negative controls, respectively. Cells were reversetransfected with 50 nmol/L siRNAs using Dharmafect 1
reagent for DU145 and Dharmafect 3 for MCF-7. Two days
later, cells were exposed to vehicle (0.01% DMSO) or
AZ1223580 at the GI50 for 5 days, and viability was assessed
by CellTiter Glo (CTG) assay (Promega). Duplicate primary
screens were analyzed to derive Z0 factors (dynamic range)
and Z-scores (effect of siRNA on viability, corrected for
within/between plate variation), as described (14–16). Triplicate second-round screens used four individual siRNAs and
the four siRNAs pooled; these and additional siRNAs are listed
in Supplementary Table S2. Data were analyzed to generate log2
surviving fractions as the ﬁnal score for the effect of IGFIR
inhibition on viability; scores <0.2 were regarded as signiﬁcant, as described (13, 14). Hits were validated by siRNA
transfection as above, analyzing after 48 hours by Western blot
or quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR, with primers listed in Supplementary Table S3), or treating with solvent
or AZ12253801 and assaying for viability after 5 days or
clonogenic survival after 10 to 20 days. Pooled data from 3
independent experiments were curve-ﬁtted using GraphPad
Prism v5 to interpolate GI50 and SF50 (concentrations inhibiting 50% of growth or survival).
Immunoﬂuorescence and IHC. Cells underwent immunoﬂuorescent staining using ERK antibody (#4695; Cell Signaling Technology). IHC used DVL3 antibody 4D3 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; see Supplementary Methods).

Xenografts. As detailed in Supplementary Methods,
mice bearing DU145 xenografts were randomly allocated to
14 days treatment with 0.05-mL solvent (DMSO), 25 mg/kg
AZ12253801 twice daily, 50 mg/kg DVLi once daily, or
combination treatment.

Results and Discussion
siRNA screens for sensitization to IGFIR inhibition
IGFIR overexpression occurs frequently in common cancers,
but is a poor predictor of clinical sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition
(10). Consistent with this, IGFIR overexpression in PC3 prostate cancer cells did not inﬂuence response to IGFIR tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) AZ12253801 that has approximately 10fold selectivity over the insulin receptor (INSR; Supplementary
Fig. S1A; ref. 17). To identify proteins that inﬂuence response to
AZ12253801, we performed siRNA screens in DU145 prostate
cancer and MCF7 breast cancer cells, conﬁrming that
AZ12253801 inhibited IGFIR phosphorylation and cell viability
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Primary screens were performed to
deplete approximately 1,000 targets; given our interest in the
involvement of IGFIR kinase in the DNA damage response
(12, 18), we selected siRNA libraries targeting kinase-related
and DNA repair–associated proteins, with positive (siPLK1)
and negative (Allstars) control siRNAs, as described (13, 14).
Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection to allow target
depletion, cells were treated with solvent or AZ12253801 at the
GI50, and viability was assayed 5 days later. Duplicate DU145
screens were highly reproducible (R2 values 0.8) and sensitive, with Z0 -factors of 0.23 to 0.6 (Supplementary Table S4)
indicating good discrimination between positive and negative
controls (15). We calculated drug sensitization Z-scores (13)
for each siRNA, rank-ordered siRNAs by Z-score, and selected
54 genes for validation (Supplementary Table S5). Triplicate
second-round screens identiﬁed 12 putative resistance mediators, including regulators of the cell cycle and DNA damage
response, and proteins with poorly characterized functions
(Fig. 1A). Seven hits in DU145 screens (CDKN2C, CNKSR1,
DUSP5, HUNK, LMTK3, MPP2, and DVL3) were also candidate
hits in MCF7 cells. Validation in low-throughput format conﬁrmed that depletion of each hit enhanced AZ12253801 sensitivity (Supplementary Table S6).
DVL3 mediates resistance to IGFIR inhibition
Known cross-talk between the IGF and WNT axes (19–21)
prompted us to investigate one of the most robust hits:
Dishevelled homolog 3 (DVL3), a poorly characterized WNT
component. DVL3 is one of three mammalian homologs of
Drosophila Dsh, a cytoplasmic protein that is phosphorylated
on binding of Wnts to Frizzled (Fz) receptors, blocking the
b-catenin destruction complex (22). DVL3 was the dominant
isoform in both DU145 and MCF7 cells (Fig. 1B), and depletion
of DVL3 but not DVL 1 or 2 sensitized to AZ12253801 (Fig. 1C
and D). Expression of siRNA-resistant FLAG-DVL3 was able to
rescue from AZ12253801 sensitization induced by DVL3 siRNA
targeting the 30 -UTR of endogenous DVL3 mRNA (Fig. 1E),
suggesting that sensitization by DVL3 depletion was unlikely to
be an off-target effect of DVL3 siRNA. As noted above,
AZ12253801 can also inhibit the closely related INSR. Although

were analyzed by Western blot. DVL3 depletion enhanced IGF-induced ERK activation, and this effect was suppressed in AZ12253801-treated cells.

DVL3-depleted DU145 and MCF7 cells were sensitized to
IGFIR depletion, INSR-depleted cells showed no signiﬁcant
reduction in viability upon DVL3 depletion (Fig. 1F and Sup-

the ability of AZ12253801 to block IGFIR. We next tested

whether intrinsic sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition is related to
endogenous DVL3 expression. In prostate (n ¼ 5) and breast
cancer (n ¼ 5) cell lines, there was no apparent relationship
between endogenous DVL3 protein and AZ12253801 GI50
(Supplementary Fig. S1D), perhaps reﬂecting genotypic differences in these small panels. In a larger sample (n ¼ 40) of wellcharacterized colorectal cancer cell lines (23, 24), mean DVL3
protein levels were signiﬁcantly lower in cell lines that were
sensitive to IGFIR antibody ﬁgitumumab (n ¼ 11), compared
with cell lines that were moderately (n ¼ 8) or highly (n ¼ 21)
ﬁgitumumab resistant (Fig. 1G), supporting the hypothesis
that DVL3 protein is associated with resistance to IGFIR
inhibition. There was no correlation with IGFIR expression
(Supplementary Fig. S1E and S1F), consistent with the
unchanged response to AZ12253801 in IGFIR-overexpressing
PC3 prostate cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). We also
noted lack of correlation between DVL3 protein and mRNA in
the colorectal cancer cell lines, likely due to posttranscriptional
regulation of DVL3 expression (25), and DVL3 mRNA did not
associate with response to ﬁgitumumab (Supplementary
Fig. S1G).

DVL3-depleted cells show enhanced ERK activation
We speculated that the association between DVL3 and
resistance to IGFIR inhibition may reﬂect cross-talk between
the WNT and IGF pathways. Previously, we and others showed
that the adaptor protein IRS-1 undergoes IGF-induced interaction with b-catenin, promoting b-catenin stabilization and
transcriptional activity (19, 20). However, in DU145 cells, there
was no evidence that IGFI affected levels of active (nonphosphorylated) b-catenin or phosphorylated DVL3 (Fig. 2A).
DVL3 depletion suppressed active b-catenin and phosphorylation of mTOR effector S6, consistent with known roles for
DVL3 in canonical WNT signaling and mTOR activation
(22, 26). DVL3-depleted cells showed no change in IGFIR
expression or activation, but unexpectedly showed increased
MEK–ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Quantiﬁcation of these
data indicates that DVL3 depletion had a detectable (although
not statistically signiﬁcant) effect on basal (ligand-unstimulated) ERK activation, and signiﬁcantly enhanced IGF-induced
ERK activation. This effect was accompanied by ERK nuclear
translocation and upregulation of ERK–E twenty-six (ETS)-like
transcription factor (ELK) target genes (Fig. 2B and C; ref. 27).

Figure 3. DVL inhibition recapitulates effects of DVL3 depletion and sensitizes to AZ12253801 in vitro and in vivo. A, serum-starved DU145 cells were DVLitreated for 16 hours, and whole-cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. DVLi inhibited DVL3 phosphorylation,
reduced active b-catenin and phospho-S6, and increased levels of phospho-ERKs. B, DU145 whole-cell extract was treated with lamda phosphatase (l) in the
absence or presence of phosphatase inhibitors (PI). The upper band of DVL3 immunoreactivity was abolished by l phosphatase and restored by PI,
consistent with DVL phosphorylation, as reported (22). C, DU145 cells were treated with AZ12253801 alone or with 100 mmol/L DVLi. Legend shows GI50

DVL3 Mediates Resistance to IGFIR Inhibition

The IGF-induced component of ERK activation in DVL3depleted cells was effectively suppressed by AZ12253801 (Fig.
2D). These data suggest that DVL3 depletion enhances both
basal and IGF-stimulated ERK activation, analogous to effects
of PTEN loss on basal and ligand-induced AKT activation (28).
Of 12 candidate screen hits (Fig. 1A), ﬁve have known
or putative roles as signaling regulators. In addition to DVL3,
these include dual-speciﬁcity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5), connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of RAS (CNKSR1), lemur
tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3), and hormonally upregulated neuassociated kinase (HUNK), reported to regulate ERKs, RAS,
AKT, and EGFR, respectively (29–32). Indeed, in DU145 cells,
HUNK depletion enhanced IGF signaling to AKT (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C), supporting the concept that response to
IGFIR inhibition is regulated by factors downstream of IGFIR.
Proximal WNT inhibition mimics effects of DVL3
depletion
Aiming to ﬁnd a drug that recapitulates effects of DVL3
depletion, we tested compounds that block WNT signaling at
different levels. Consistent with a role in Axin stabilization (33),
the toolbox tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 upregulated Axin1 and
inhibited mTOR, but did not activate ERKs or sensitize to

AZ12253801 (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C). We then tested
effects of WNT inhibition at a more proximal step, blocking
DVL function directly. The DVL-PDZ domain has a peptidebinding cleft, involved in transducing signals from the membrane receptor Fz to downstream canonical and noncanonical
pathways (22). The small-molecule inhibitor DVLi competitively binds to the cleft of the DVL-PDZ domain and blocks
WNT signaling in Xenopus embryo and PC3 prostate cancer
cells (34). This agent inhibited DVL3 phosphorylation and
phenocopied DVL3 depletion, reducing active b-catenin and
phospho-S6, activating ERKs in the absence of ligand, and
sensitizing to AZ12253801 in viability and clonogenic assays
(Fig. 3A–D). DVLi also sensitized to IGFIR TKI BMS-754807
that is being evaluated clinically (35; Supplementary Fig. S3D).
We noted evidence for reciprocal sensitization: despite suppressing active b-catenin and mTOR, DVLi alone caused
negligible growth inhibition, perhaps related at least in part
to ERK activation, but with AZ12253801 caused signiﬁcant loss
of viability (Fig. 3E).
Although the DVLi we used has relatively low potency, the
WNT pathway is an intense focus for drug development
(34, 36), offering the prospect of more potent inhibitors in
future. Therefore, we used this DVLi to perform proof-of-

Figure 4. The ability of DVL3 to inﬂuence sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition is linked to its capacity to regulate ERK activation. A, serum-starved DU145 cells were
treated with 100 mmol/L DVLi for 16 hours and in the ﬁnal 0 to 60 minutes with 10 nmol/L IGFI. B, serum-starved DU145 cells were treated with 100 mmol/L DVLi
for 1 to 16 hours and in the ﬁnal 30 minutes with 10 nmol/L IGFI. Graphs (A and B) show phospho-ERK (mean  range), corrected for total ERK, from
two independent experiments. C, serum-starved DU145 cells were treated with 100 mmol/L DVLi and/or 5 mmol/L AZD6244 for 16 hours and in the
ﬁnal 30 minutes with 10 nmol/L IGFI. D, DU145 cells were treated with AZ12253801 alone or 100 mmol/L DVLi alone or with 5 mmol/L MEK inhibitor
AZD6244, and cell viability was assayed after 5 days. Graph shows pooled data from four independent experiments; legend shows GI50 values and fold
sensitization (GI50 ratio). Right, graph, relative proliferation at 100 nmol/L AZ12253801 (  , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001, by one-way ANOVA).

principle experiments, testing its ability to inﬂuence sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition in the prostate and breast cancer
cell lines we characterized previously (Supplementary Fig.
S1D). Two prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and 22Rv1) were
sensitized to AZ12253801 by DVL inhibition; both had
detectable basal ERK phosphorylation that was enhanced
by DVLi (Fig. 3F). The other three (PC3, LNCaP, and LNCaPLN3) did not manifest detectable basal or DVLi-induced ERK
phosphorylation and were not sensitized to AZ12253801 by
DVLi. The ﬁve breast cancer cell lines all showed increased
ERK activation and enhanced response to AZ12253801 upon
DVL inhibition (Fig. 3G). Thus, 7 of 10 cell lines showed
DVLi-induced ERK activation, and in each, DVLi enhanced
response to IGFIR inhibition. Supporting the existence of
functional cross-talk between the IGF axis and proximal
WNT components, upregulation of IGF-binding protein 5
was shown to mediate growth inhibitory effects of a soluble
Wnt inhibitor in murine MMTV-Wnt1–driven tumors (36).
Therefore, to test the potential clinical relevance of our
ﬁndings, we evaluated IGFIR and DVL inhibition in mice
bearing DU145 prostate cancer xenografts. AZ12253801 or
DVLi alone had no signiﬁcant effects on tumor growth, but
growth in the combination treatment group was signiﬁcantly retarded compared with control-treated (P < 0.001),

AZ12253801-treated (P < 0.001), and DVLi-treated animals
(P < 0.01; Fig. 3H).
DVL3 regulates IGFI-induced ERK activation
These data indicate that blockade of proximal WNT signaling enhances sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition, and suggest that
this property tracks with regulation of MEK–ERK signaling
(Figs. 2A–C and 3F and G). To characterize this effect further,
we performed time-course experiments in DVL-inhibited
DU145 cells. IGFI induced rapid activation of IGFIR and AKT
that persisted in control cells for at least 60 minutes, whereas
ERK activation peaked at 10 minutes and resolved to basal
levels by 60 minutes (Fig. 4A). In contrast, there was clear
persistence of IGF-induced ERK phosphorylation at 30 to 60
minutes in cells where DVL3 was inhibited (Fig. 4A) or depleted
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). Persistent ERK activation in DVLinhibited cells was apparent within 4 hours of DVLi treatment,
and was strikingly enhanced upon IGF treatment (Fig. 4B). An
increase in IGF-induced ERK activation was also observed in
MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). These results support the
existence of a link between the ability of DVL3 to inﬂuence
sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition and to attenuate the response of
the IGF axis to a mitogenic stimulus via MEK–ERK. Consequently, DVL3 depletion or inhibition creates an environment

DVL3 Mediates Resistance to IGFIR Inhibition

that is permissive for signaling, recently characterized as
"signalability" (37). In contrast, DVL inhibition did not inﬂuence the response to IGFI in PC3 prostate cancer cells that were
not sensitized to AZ12253801 by DVLi (Supplementary Fig.
S4C). To test whether ERK activation is required for DVL3 to
modify the response to IGFIR inhibition, we abolished ERK
activity using MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (Fig. 4C). MEK-inhibited
DU145 cells showed almost complete rescue from DVLiinduced sensitization to IGFIR inhibition (Fig. 4D), suggesting
that the ability of DVL3 to regulate MEK–ERK contributes to
the sensitization effect.
DVL3 complexes with SHC, Grb2, and SOS to regulate
RAS activation
To investigate how DVL3 regulates ERKs, we performed
RAS activation assays and found that RAS was activated in
DVL-inhibited cells (Fig. 5A). This contrasts with previously
reported WNT:ERK cross-talk, occurring at more distal WNT
signaling nodes, that generates positive feedback between
the two pathways (38). Given that DVL3 depletion did not
activate IGFIR itself (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4B),
and DVL3-depleted or DVL-inhibited cells showed no
change in EGF-induced ERK activation or sensitivity to
EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib (Supplementary Fig. S5A and
S5B), we reasoned that RAS activation in DVL-depleted or
DVL-inhibited cells was unlikely to be initiated at the level of
these RTKs.
It is increasingly recognized that mitogenic signals generated by RTKs are integrated by complexes of adaptor and
scaffolding proteins, including IRS-1, a well-recognized focus
for feedback signaling via ERKs and mTOR-S6 kinase (39).
However, IRS-1 knockdown did not inﬂuence AZ12253801
sensitivity or ERK activation induced by DVL inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S5C and S5D). In contrast, ERK activation in
DVL-inhibited cells was suppressed by depletion of the adaptor
protein Shc, exchange factor son-of-sevenless (SOS), or growth
factor receptor–bound-2 (Grb2; Fig. 5B). ERK activation was
not abolished by depletion of IGFIR (Fig. 5B), suggesting that
the ability of DVL3 depletion or DVL inhibition to activate
basal (ligand-unstimulated) MEK–ERK signaling was IGFIR
independent, perhaps induced by another RTK or signaling
complex.
These data suggest that DVL3 suppresses signal transduction at the level of the Shc–Grb2–SOS complex. DVLs
were not identiﬁed as Grb2 interactors in HEK293 cells (40),
but DVL3 does contain the atypical proline-rich region
shown in DVL2 to bind Grb2 and promote canonical WNT
signaling (41). Indeed, complexes containing Grb2 and DVL3
were detectable in DU145 cells by immunoprecipitation and
Grb2 pulldown (Fig. 5C and D). These complexes also contained the putative tumor suppressor Disabled 2 (DAB2),
reported to limit RAS activation by competing with SOS for
Grb2 binding (42–44). Consistent with this role, and with the
association between ERK activation and sensitization to
IGFIR inhibition (Fig. 3F and G and Fig. 4D), DAB2 depletion
mimicked DVL3 depletion in sensitizing to AZ12253801 and
enhancing IGF-induced ERK activation (Fig. 5E). DVL3 and
DAB2 showed similar binding patterns to individual Grb2

www.aacrjournals.org

domains (Supplementary Fig. S5E), interacting principally
with the amino-terminal SH3 domain and central SH2
domain, whereas as reported, SOS bound to Grb2 amino
and carboxy-terminal SH3 domains (45). We speculated that
DVL3 interacts with Grb2 via DAB2, but found that DAB2depleted cells still contained DVL3:Grb2 complexes (Supplementary Fig. S5F), and could be further sensitized to
IGFIR inhibition by DVLi, with 18-fold reduction in
AZ12253801 GI50 in DAB2-deleted, DVL-inhibited cells, compared with 2.8- and 4.6-fold sensitization induced separately
by DAB2 depletion or DVL inhibition (Fig. 5F). These data
suggest that DVL3 has a different role from DAB2 in regulating signal transduction to RAS.
DVL3 expression in clinical cancers
To investigate the clinical relevance of these ﬁndings, we
evaluated DVL3 expression in patient tumors. Given the lack
of correlation shown previously between DVL3 mRNA and
protein (Supplementary Fig. S1G), we developed an IHC
protocol, with controls including DVL3-depleted DU145 cells,
to assess DVL3 expression by intensity  percentage score
(IPS; Supplementary Methods; Fig. 6A and Supplementary
Fig. S6A and S6B). Approximately 50% of breast and prostate
cancers contained moderate or heavy cytoplasmic DVL3
(Supplementary Fig. S6C) that did not correlate with stage,
grade, or patient survival (Supplementary Table S7). As a ﬁrst
approach to testing for the correlation between DVL3 protein
and sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition, we assessed DVL3 in
Ewing sarcomas, reported to be responsive to IGFIR inhibitor
monotherapy (4, 5, 46, 47), and head and neck squamous cell
cancers (HNSCC) that are resistant (48). The results are
shown in Fig. 6B and C; all but one of the Ewing sarcomas
contained low or no detectable DVL3, and the mean DVL3
staining score was signiﬁcantly higher in HNSCCs (P ¼
0.0032). We then assessed DVL3 protein expression in archival tumors from patients recruited to early-phase clinical
trials of IGFIR antibodies ﬁgitumumab or AVE164 (Supplementary Table S8; refs. 9, 48). Figure 6D shows examples of
DVL3 staining in eight of the trial cases, and Fig. 6E shows
analysis with respect to progression-free survival (PFS).
Although there was overlap in DVL3 expression between
patients experiencing early progression versus prolonged
control, it was notable that of eight patients achieving
prolonged disease control (>84 days, including one partial
remission), six of these tumors had low DVL3 expression (IPS
<5; Supplementary Table S8). PFS was longer in patients
whose tumors showed no/low DVL3 (n ¼ 9; PFS, 137  28
days) compared with patients whose tumors had moderate
or strong DVL3 (n ¼ 11; PFS, 70  13 days; P ¼ 0.031), and
DVL3 staining was negatively correlated with PFS (Spearman
r ¼ 0.55; P ¼ 0.0125; Fig. 6E). Included here were melanomas, ovarian, gastrointestinal, and HNSCCs (Supplementary
Table S8), suggesting that DVL3 expression may have predictive value for response to IGFIR inhibition in a range of
tumor types.
These data deﬁne new roles for DVL3 in suppressing
signal transduction from IGFIR to RAS, and regulating
response to IGFIR blockade. The association between RAS

DVL3 Mediates Resistance to IGFIR Inhibition

Figure 7. Model for DVL3 as a regulator of RAS activation and mediator of resistance to IGFIR inhibition. DVL3 exists in a complex of adaptor proteins
that includes Shc, Grb2, and the tumor suppressor DAB2. Both DVL3 and DAB2 suppress signal transduction from IGFIR to RAS. When DVL3 and/or
DAB2 are depleted, or DVLs are inhibited, there is enhanced basal (ligand-unstimulated) RAS–MEK–ERK activation, and in the presence of
ligand, selective ampliﬁcation of IGF signaling via the RAS–MEK–ERK pathway. This state is associated with increased dependency on IGF signaling
and enhanced sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition.

activation and sensitization to IGFIR inhibition is counterintuitive, but is consistent with a report that KRAS-mutated
non–small cell lung cancer cells show IGF-dependent PI3K
activity and are sensitive to IGFIR inhibition (49). The
ﬁnding that responses to IGFIR inhibition are modiﬁed by
manipulating DVL3 expression or function suggests that
DVL3 contributes to the resistance phenotype. Thus, DVL3
depletion or inhibition leads to ampliﬁcation of IGF-induced
RAS–MEK–ERK activation, and this property is associated
with enhanced sensitivity to IGFIR inhibition (Fig. 7). Similar
AZ12253801 sensitization and ERK activation were induced
by depletion of DAB2 (Fig. 5E), reported to interact with
Grb2 and suppress RAS activation (42–44). DAB2-depleted
cells were capable of responding to DVL inhibition with
enhanced ERK activation and AZ12253801 sensitization (Fig.

5F), suggesting that DVL3 has a nonredundant function in
the Shc–Grb2–SOS complex.
Our screen identiﬁed additional candidate resistance mediators (DVL3, DUSP5, CNKSR1, LMTK3, and HUNK) with roles
in regulating receptor or postreceptor signaling. The ability to
inﬂuence IGFIR sensitivity to both ligand and receptor inhibition is reminiscent of the functional effects of EGFR kinase
mutations, which favor the active conformation of EGFR
kinase and render EGFR sensitive to EGFR TKIs (50). Comparable mutations have been sought but not reported in IGFIR; it
is plausible that similar tuning of IGF signaling is achieved by
changes in signal transduction complexes downstream of
IGFIR. In summary, our data identify a role for DVL3 in
suppressing signal transduction from IGFIR to RAS and attenuating response to IGFIR blockade. We propose that the

Figure 6. DVL3 protein expression is inversely correlated with response to IGFIR antibody. A, DU145 cells were transfected with Allstars or DVL3 siRNA,
after 48 hours were formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded and used as controls for immunostaining, in parallel with sections of a transurethral resection

and tissue controls were included in every staining run for quality control purposes. B, TMAs of Ewing sarcoma and HNSCC underwent IHC staining in
the same staining run. Representative images of Ewing sarcoma (top), a sample of normal kidney included as a control on the same TMA slide (left),
