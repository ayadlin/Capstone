Abstract
In breast cancer cells with HER2 gene amplification, HER2 receptors exist on the cell surface as monomers,
homodimers, and heterodimers with EGFR/HER3. The therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, an approved therapy
for HER2þ breast cancer, cannot block ligand-induced HER2 heterodimers, suggesting it cannot effectively
inhibit HER2 signaling. Hence, HER2 oligomeric states may predict the odds of a clinical response to
trastuzumab in HER2-driven tumors. To test this hypothesis, we generated nontransformed human MCF10A
mammary epithelial cells stably expressing a chimeric HER2–FKBP molecule that could be conditionally
induced to homodimerize by adding the FKBP ligand AP1510, or instead induced to heterodimerize with EGFR
or HER3 by adding the heterodimer ligands EGF/TGFa or heregulin. AP1510, EGF, and heregulin each induced
growth of MCF10A cells expressing HER2–FKBP. Trastuzumab inhibited homodimer-mediated but not
heterodimer-mediated cell growth. In contrast, the HER2 antibody pertuzumab, which blocks HER2 heterodimerization, inhibited growth induced by heregulin but not AP1510. Lastly, the HER2/EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor lapatinib blocked both homodimer- and heterodimer-induced growth. AP1510 triggered phosphorylation of Erk1/2 but not AKT, whereas trastuzumab inhibited AP1510-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation and ShcHER2 homodimer binding, but not TGFa-induced AKT phosphorylation. Consistent with these observations,
high levels of HER2 homodimers correlated with longer time to progression following trastuzumab therapy in a
cohort of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Together, our findings confirm the notion that HER2
oligomeric states regulate HER2 signaling, also arguing that trastuzumab sensitivity of homodimers may reflect
their inability to activate the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT pathway. A clinical implication of our
results is that high levels of HER2 homodimers may predict a positive response to trastuzumab. Cancer Res; 71(5);

HER2 gene amplification and protein overexpression, present
in about 25% of invasive breast cancers (5), are associated with
poor patient prognosis. In HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells, HER2 is present in a complex equilibrium of preassociated active and inactive homodimers, heterodimers, and
monomers on the cell surface (6). Recruitment of HER2 to its
coreceptors potentiates signaling by HER2-containing heterodimers (7, 8). In HER2-overexpressing cells, the kinaseimpaired HER3 coreceptor is the main adaptor that directly
couples to the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT pathway (9). HER2 overexpression
also activates the Ras/Raf/MEK (MAP/ERK kinase)/MAPK
(mitogen activated protein kinase) pathway via the recruitment of the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Shc (10).
Trastuzumab, an antibody against the ectodomain of HER2,
is approved for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer (11, 12). Overall, trastuzumab is clinically effective but a
significant proportion of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
patients either do not respond or eventually become resistant
to trastuzumab (13–15). Predictive assays to reliably identify

HER2-overexpressing cancers that will respond or not to
existing anti-HER2 therapy are not yet available.
Several studies have reported on possible mechanisms of
resistance to trastuzumab. For example, amplification of PI3K
signaling due to loss of lipid phosphatase PTEN or expression
of PIK3CA-activating mutations is associated with lower
response to trastuzumab (16, 17). Another pathway to resistance is overexpression of ligands of EGFR and HER3/4 (18).
This is consistent with structural and cellular data using ErbB
receptor ectodomains, which show that trastuzumab is unable
to block ligand-induced EGFR/HER2 and HER2/HER3 heterodimers (19, 20). Thus, we hypothesized that HER2-overexpressing breast cancers containing high levels of EGFR/HER2 and
HER2/HER3 heterodimers, surrogate markers of ErbB ligandinduced transactivation of HER2, will exhibit a lower response
to trastuzumab compared with HER2þ tumors with undetectable or low levels of these heterodimers. In order to
identify differential signaling induced by HER2-containing
homo- and heterodimers and to develop potential biomarkers
of response to trastuzumab, we have developed a cell system
in which HER2 dimerization can be conditionally regulated.

Triton lysis buffer, followed by immunoprecipitation with an
HER2 antibody Ab8 (Neomarkers), as described (24, 25). For
immunoblot analysis, cells were lysed in 1% NP-40 buffer
containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples
were sonicated for 10 seconds and centrifuged at 14,000
rpm for 5 minutes at 4 C; protein concentrations were quantitated using the BCA assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations
were done with HER3 or HA antibodies, followed by protein G
(for HA) or protein A (for HER3) beads (Sigma), as described
(26). Immune complexes and whole cell lysates were subjected
to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane.
Primary antibodies for immunoblotting included total
AKT, S473-pAKT, T308-pAKT, HA, pErk1/2, Erk1/2 (Cell
Signaling), HER3, EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HER2
(Neomarkers), actin (Sigma), and the 4G10 phosphotyrosine
antibody (Millipore).

Materials and Methods

Gene expression profiling
RNA was isolated from cells grown on 100-mm dishes, using
the ToTALLY RNA kit from Ambion following the manufacturer's protocol. Synthesis of cRNA target, its hybridization to Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays, and scanning of those
arrays was done using Affymetrix GeneChip products and
reagents at the Vanderbilt Microarray Shared Resource. Data
were analyzed as described in Supplementary Methods (27).
Raw data are available in GEO (accession # GSE22288).

Generation of MCF10A cells expressing HER2–FKBP–
HA chimeric receptors
Vector-expressing HER2–FKBP–HA chimera was generated
as described in Supplementary Methods (21). Retroviruses
expressing HER2 chimeras were produced by transfecting
Phoenix-Ampho cells, using published methods (22), and then
utilized to transduce MCF10A human mammary epithelial
cells. Stably transfected cells were selected in 1 mg/mL
G418 (22).
Cell culture, receptor ligands, and inhibitors
MCF10A–HER2–FKBP–HA cells were maintained in
DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with epidermal growth
factor (EGF; 20 ng/mL; Invitrogen/Gibco), cholera toxin
(100 ng/mL; Sigma), hydrocortisone (500 ng/mL; Sigma),
insulin (10 mg/mL; Invitrogen/Gibco), and 5% horse serum
(HS; Hyclone). For experiments examining receptor dimerization and signaling, cells were treated with ligands  inhibitors,
as described in Supplementary Methods.
Three-dimensional Matrigel growth assay
About 5  103 cells/well were seeded in 8-well chamber
slides in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with cholera
toxin, hydrocortisone, insulin and 2% HS on growth factor–
reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences), as described (23). Ligands
 inhibitors were added at the time of seeding cells and
replenished along with fresh media every 3 days. Acinar
growth was quantified as described in Supplementary
Methods.
Cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, and
immunoblotting
Cells were cross-linked with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate
(BS3), as described (24). After cross-linking, cells were lysed in

Cell-surface biotinylation
The Cell Surface Protein Isolation kit (Pierce) was used for
biotinylation studies according to the manufacturer's protocol
and as described in Supplementary Methods.

Reverse-phase protein array
Cell lysates were prepared for reverse-phase protein array
(RPPA), as described previously (28–30). RPPA was done, and
data were analyzed as described in Supplementary Methods.
Fluorescent proximity–based antibody-dependent
dimer detection (VeraTag) assay
VeraTag assays with tumor sections and cells treated with
receptor ligands were carried out as described previously (25)
and in Supplementary Methods.
Study patient population
A description of clinical characteristics of the study population is provided in Table 1. Response to treatment was
documented by review of all imaging studies according to
Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria, as previously
described (31). Further details are provided in Supplementary
Methods.
Statistical analysis
Clinical cutoffs for HER2 homodimer levels (HER22) were
determined by positional scanning analysis and selection of
the cutoff associated with the lowest P value for time to
progression (TTP). Correlation of HER22 levels with clinical
outcome was determined as described in Supplementary
Methods.

Results
Cell system with controlled ErbB receptor dimerization
We generated HER2 chimeras containing the full-length
human HER2 sequence fused to HA-tagged ligand-binding
domain of FK506-binding protein (FKBP; Fig. 1A). A retroviral
vector encoding for this chimera was stably transduced into
MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells to produce
MCF10A/HER2/FKBP/HA cells (henceforth FKBP–HA cells).
Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked HER2 confirmed induction of HER2 homodimer formation following addition of
synthetic FKBP ligand AP1510 (Fig. 1B, left). Sustained
AP1510-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 (24 hours)
was confirmed by precipitation with an HA antibody followed
by p-Tyr immunoblot (Fig. 1B, right). Western blot analyses
revealed activation of pErk1/2 but not T308- or S473-pAKT
following AP1510 treatment (Fig. 1C, left). To confirm that
AP1510-induced pErk1/2 does not involve EGFR activation,
FKBP–HA cells were treated with receptor ligands  the

www.aacrjournals.org

EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Erlotinib blocked TGFa (EGFR
ligand)-induced but not AP1510- or heregulin (HER3
ligand)-induced pErk1/2 (Fig. 1C, right). These results suggest
that HER2 homodimers and HER2-containing heterodimers
preferentially engage different downstream signaling effectors
with HER2 homodimers activating the Erk1/2 but not the AKT
pathway.
Since we used full-length human HER2 to produce the
HER2–FKBP–HA chimera, we reasoned the transfected
HER2 receptor should retain its ability to dimerize with
ligand-stimulated EGFR and HER3. To test this, FKBP–HA
cells were treated with AP1510, heregulin, and TGFa. Immunoprecipitation with HER3 antibody followed by HA immunoblot indicated heregulin-enhanced HER2/HER3 heterodimer
formation compared with AP1510-treated cells (Fig. 1D, right).
Similarly, precipitation with HA antibody followed by EGFR
immunoblot analyses showed that TGFa but not AP1510
stimulated the formation of HER2/EGFR heterodimers
(Fig. 1D, left).
Cell growth following HER2 homodimerization is
inhibited by trastuzumab
We next examined growth of FKBP–HA cells in response to
different ligands. Wild-type MCF10A cells form polarized,
single-cell, quiescent acini in 3-dimensional (3D) basement
membrane. However, in MCF10A cells transfected with an
HER2 chimera, activation of HER2 results in enhanced proliferation, reduction in apoptosis of centrally located cells,
disruption of tight junctions and polarity, and induction of
acinar expansion without invasion into surrounding matrix
(23, 32). Like in these previous reports, all three ligands,
AP1510, EGF, and heregulin, induced formation of invasive
FKBP–HA cell acini in growth factor–reduced 3D Matrigel
while cells in which HER2 had not been activated did not grow
(Fig. 2A). Trastuzumab completely inhibited AP1510-stimulated but not EGF- or heregulin-stimulated growth. Pertuzumab, an antibody that binds to the heterodimerization
domain of HER2 (33), inhibited acinar growth induced by
heregulin but not by AP1510 or EGF. Lapatinib, a dual
inhibitor of the HER2 and EGFR tyrosine kinases, blocked
EGF-, heregulin-, and AP1510-induced growth (Fig. 2). These
results confirm that growth of FKBP–HA cells as a result of
ligand-induced HER2 heterodimerization is insensitive to
trastuzumab.
Differential signaling by HER2-containing homo- and
heterodimers
HER2 homodimers activated Erk1/2 but not PI3K/AKT
(Fig. 1C). On the other hand, TGFa-induced HER2/EGFR
heterodimers and activated both AKT and Erk1/2 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Heregulin induced HER2/HER3 complex
formation but the effect on AKT and Erk1/2 was not pronounced, presumably due to low levels of HER3 present in
FKBP–HA cells (Supplementary Fig. 1A). To further characterize dimer-induced signaling, we carried out RPPA assays on
cells treated with receptor ligands over a time course. We used
96 antibodies against total and phosphorylated proteins, using
methods analogous to high-throughput dot blotting (29, 30).

were stimulated with AP1510 or TGFa (left) or with AP1510 or heregulin (right), each for 15 minutes. Cell lysates were precipitated with HA (left) or HER3 (right)
antibodies, and immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with HA, EGFR, or HER3 antibodies as indicated.

We undertook step-down quadratic regression analysis for
pattern recognition in time course studies (ref. 34; Supplementary Fig. 1B) and significance analysis using the Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) algorithm [false discovery
rate (FDR) ¼ 0%; Fig. 3A] on RPPA from ligand-stimulated
cells. We also studied activation of signaling downstream of
the PI3K/AKT (as phosphorylation of AKT, GSK3, mTOR,
p70S6, 4EBP, and S6) and MAPK (as phosphorylation of
MAPK, MEK, Ser118 ERa, and JNK) pathways (35). RPPA assays
confirmed that TGFa induced both PI3K and MAPK pathways, whereas AP1510 stimulated only the MAPK pathway as
measured by activation of signaling downstream of these two
pathways (Supplementary Fig. 2). RPPA analysis also confirmed previously reported association between HER2/HER3
heterocomplex formation and activation of Src measured as
phosphorylation at Y416 (Fig. 3A, iii and iv; refs. 36, 37). This is
consistent with a previous report in which heregulin induced
recruitment of HER3 to an HER2-Src (36). Furthermore, 2
studies have reported on heregulin-induced activation of
HER3/HER2 dimers resulting in Src kinase activation (37,

1874

Cancer Res; 71(5) March 1, 2011

38). In contrast to HER3/HER2 heterodimers, RPPA analysis
showed that HER2 homodimers and HER2/EGFR heterodimers did not induce Src.Y416 phosphorylation.
We next generated microarrays on RNA isolated from cells
treated with receptor ligands. Analysis of transcriptional
events induced by activation of ErbB dimers indicated that
unique genes were regulated by HER2/HER2, HER2/EGFR,
and HER2/HER3 dimers (Fig. 3B). SAM identified 323 genes
(FDR ¼ 0%) that are significantly different among the 4
treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 3). Furthermore, gene
expression data from triplicate RNA samples from different
treatments cluster into distinct groups, indicating that HER2containing dimers activate unique transcriptional profiles
(Fig. 3C). A comparative analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Software) of the effect of activated ErbB receptors on canonical
pathways involved in human malignancies revealed that
HER2/HER2 and HER2/EGFR, but not HER2/HER3, can modulate the "cell cycle: G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation" pathway (Fig. 3D). Cyclin B1 (CCNB1), a known regulator
of G2/M transition (39), is associated with aggressive pheno-

type in breast cancer (40). Interestingly, our RPPA data show
that HER2 homodimers and HER2/EGFR heterodimers, but
not HER2/HER3 heterodimers, enhance CCNB1 expression
(Fig. 3A, i, ii, and vi), thus concurring with the Ingenuity
Pathway analysis.
In a recent study, hierarchical clustering of gene expression
data from 58 HER2-overexpressing patients identified a 158gene signature that can distinguish between patients with
poor and good prognoses (27). To examine if this HER2derived prognostic predictor (HDPP) gene signature correlated with the ligand-induced RNA expression signatures, we
merged our microarray data with the "good prognosis" and
"poor prognosis" centroids (27). Complete hierarchical clustering was done using 139 of 158 centroid genes (due to
platform representation). Consistent with broader induction
of signaling, the TGFa-induced signature clustered with the
poor prognostic signature whereas AP1510-induced signature
clustered with the good prognostic signature (Supplementary
Fig. 4). Although heregulin-treated cells showed a trend
toward increased similarity with the poor prognostic signature, they clustered with the good prognostic signature (Supplementary Fig. 4). This analysis further supports differential
molecular outputs of different HER2-containing dimers and is

compatible with EGFR/HER2 heterodimers being the key
complex associated with a worse prognosis.
Trastuzumab blocks HER2 homodimer- but not
heterodimer-induced Erk1/2 activity
We next sought to determine if trastuzumab selectively
blocks signaling downstream of the ErbB receptor network.
Immunoblot analysis of lysates from ligand-stimulated FKBP–
HA cells showed that trastuzumab blocked AP1510-induced
but not TGFa- or heregulin-induced pErk1/2. Consistent with
the cell growth data, trastuzumab did not inhibit TGFa- or
heregulin-induced pAKT (Fig. 4A). Cell-surface biotinylation
studies indicated that trastuzumab can induce similar HER2
internalization in AP1510-, TGFa-, and heregulin-treated cells
(Fig. 4B), suggesting that the selective inhibitory effect of
trastuzumab on Erk1/2 was not due to a differential effect
on receptor binding and subsequent receptor downregulation
from the cell surface.
The adaptor protein Shc is recruited by HER2 to induce
MAPK signaling (10); thus, we examined whether trastuzumab
impaired the engagement of Shc by activated HER2. Chimeric
HER2 was precipitated using an HA antibody from cells
treated with different ligands  trastuzumab followed by

treated with AP1510, TGFa, or heregulin for 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours, as indicated in Materials and Methods. Hierarchical clustering was done with
proteins that underwent statistically significant change (identified using the SAM algorithm with an FDR of 0%) compared with control for each time point.
Specific proteins are indicated to the right of each panel. B–D, RNA was isolated from control, AP1510-, TGFa-, or heregulin-treated cells (48 hours) and
subjected to microarray analysis as indicated in Materials and Methods. B, Venn diagram was drawn with up- or downregulated genes with each treatment.
Only genes that underwent at least a 1.5-fold change (P < 0.05) were included. C, hierarchical clustering was done with a gene list generated by the

dissociated Shc only from AP1510- but not from TGFa- or
heregulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 4A, bottom two panels). This
result suggests that trastuzumab selectively blocks HER2
homodimer–induced Erk1/2 by causing a dissociation of Shc
from HER2 homodimers. We next postulated that inhibition of

we treated AP1510- and EGF-stimulated cells in 3D Matrigel

inhibited pErk1/2 in both AP1510- and EGF-induced cells
whereas BEZ-235 blocked EGF-induced as well as basal pAKT
(Fig. 4E). Although AP1510-induced growth is driven by Erk1/2
activity, we believe that blocking the prosurvival PI3K/AKT
pathway by BEZ-235 is sufficient to suppress growth in the
absence of any compensatory upregulation of pErk1/2.
Although it is possible that the inhibition of mTOR also plays
a role in suppressing AP1510-induced growth by BEZ-235, we
chose the drug to ensure complete inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR network. Such a strategy may minimize the possibility of
PI3K pathway reactivation (41). These results suggest that the
increased sensitivity of HER2 homodimer–driven growth to
trastuzumab can be attributed to selective inhibition of Erk1/2
and low levels of active AKT.
High HER2 homodimer levels correlate with response
to trastuzumab
We expanded our study to measure levels of HER2-containing homo- and heterodimers in a panel of 3 trastuzu-

mab-sensitive and 5 trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer
cell lines with HER2 gene amplification (Supplementary
Table 2). We employed a fluorescent antibody–based proximity assay (VeraTag). This assay can quantify protein–
protein interactions in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) cell pellet or tissue sections and involves the use
of 2 HER2 monoclonal antibodies, one conjugated to a
fluorescent reporter tag and the other linked to a photosensitizer molecule. Photoactivation with UV light results in
the photosensitizer generating singlet oxygen, which then
cleaves the fluorescent tag on the second antibody. The
sphere of influence of the singlet oxygen is limited by the
proximity of receptors to which the antibodies are directed
(25). The cleaved fluorescent tag can then be quantified
using capillary electrophoresis and used as an indicator of
levels of protein–protein interaction. Using this assay, we
confirmed that HER2 homodimers were induced only in
AP1510-treated but not TGFa- or heregulin-treated, formalin-fixed FKBP–HA cells (Fig. 5A).

Figure 5. HER2-containing dimer levels in HER2þ breast cancer cell lines. A, fluorescent antibody-based proximity (VeraTag) assay to confirm receptor
ligand-induced HER2 homodimers (HER22). Cells were treated with AP1510, TGFa, or heregulin for 15 minutes; formalin-fixed cell pellets were prepared as
indicated in Materials and Methods. SKBR3 cells, which exhibit HER2 gene amplification (7), were used as positive controls. B, lysates from the indicated cell
lines were subjected to the VeraTag assay to measure HER2 homodimers and total HER2. MCF7 cells, with a single copy of HER2, were used as a negative
control. C, lysates from the indicated cell lines were subjected to the VeraTag assay to measure HER2/HER3 heterodimers (HER23) and total HER3. MCF7
cells treated with heregulin were used as a positive control for HER2/HER3 dimer formation. D, nonparametric t test (Mann–Whitney) to compare
HER2-containing dimer formation between trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant lines.

There was a trend for higher levels of HER2/HER2 homodimer (HER22) in trastuzumab-sensitive lines compared with
the resistant lines [P ¼ 0.07; Fig. 5B (left) and D (left)]. We
realize that this is a small sample size and as such the power

Signaling by HER2 Dimers and Response to Trastuzumab

Figure 6. High HER2 homodimer levels correlate with response to trastuzumab. A, tumor sections from paraffin blocks of HER2þ primary tumors were
subjected to the VeraTag assay as indicated in Materials and Methods. Patients were divided into 4 groups on the basis of quartiles of measured HER2
homodimer (HER22) levels. ORR and CB were calculated for each subgroup of patients. CR, complete response; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; PD,
progressive disease. B, univariate KM analysis examining TTP using HER22. Cutoffs were determined by positional scanning and used to differentiate high

(HER23; P ¼ 0.07) levels in sensitive lines than in resistant lines
(Fig. 5C and D, right). This observation points to the possibility
that in these 3 sensitive lines (BT474, SKBR3, and SUM225),
trastuzumab blocks the high levels of both HER22 dimers and
ligand-independent HER23 dimers (43).
Finally, we employed this assay to quantify levels of HER22
dimers in FFPE sections from HER2-overexpressing primary
breast cancers that had been treated with trastuzumab and for
which outcome data were available (Table 1). Patients were
sorted into 4 groups according to quartiles of measured
HER22. Overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit
(CB) were calculated for each subgroup of patients as outcome
measures (Fig. 6A). In both analyses, a statistically significant
trend favoring better responses at higher levels of HER22 (test
for trend P ¼ 0.002 for ORR and P ¼ 0.012 for CB) was
observed. Univariate Kaplan–Meier (KM) analyses examining
TTP were done. Cutoffs determined by positional scanning
were used to discriminate "high" from "low" HER22 (HER22

vs. <HER22 ¼ 2.5). Statistically significant relationships were
observed with those patients exhibiting higher levels of HER22
(HR ¼ 0.43; P ¼ 0.0015) experiencing longer TTP than those
patients with lower HER22 (Fig. 6B). Median TTP was 4.2 and
11.3 months for the subgroups with HER22 values below and
above the cutoff, respectively. Univariate KM analyses were
also done using overall survival (OS) as the outcome end point
(Fig. 6C). Patients with higher levels of HER22 exhibited a
median OS of 37.4 months versus 26.6 months in those with
HER22 levels below the cutoff (HR ¼ 0.54; P ¼ 0.039).

Discussion
In tumors with HER2 gene amplification, activation of HER2
network results in downstream activation of PI3K/AKT (9) and
MAPK (10). The HER2 antibody trastuzumab has changed the
natural history of breast cancer overall. However, many
patients with HER2 gene–amplified tumors do not respond

or eventually progress after therapy with trastuzumab (14, 44),
thus suggesting the presence of de novo and acquired mechanisms of drug resistance. Coexistent mutational alterations in
PI3K/AKT pathway have been associated with a lower response
to trastuzumab in preclinical and retrospective clinical cohorts
(16, 17). HER2þ tumors with high levels of HER2 C-terminal
fragments that lack the trastuzumab-binding epitope have also
been reported to be resistant to trastuzumab (45). Despite
these important leads, there is no widely used biomarker(s)
that can reliably predict lack of benefit from trastuzumab in
patients bearing HER2-overexpressing tumors.
In this study, we developed a cell-based model in which we
conditionally regulated activation of the ErbB network (Fig. 1).
Using this model, we identified distinct transcriptional and
signaling profiles induced by activation of HER2-containing
homo- and heterodimers (Fig. 3). HER2 homodimers activated
predominantly the MAPK but not the PI3K/AKT pathway (Fig. 3;
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Likely as a result of the high levels
of EGFR in MCF10A cells (46) used to generate the FKBP–HA
cells, the EGFR ligand TGFa induced a broader signaling
spectrum than AP1510 (Fig. 3; Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2).
Furthermore, gene expression induced by the EGFR ligand was
associated with a recently reported poor prognosis signature in
patients bearing HER2-overexpressing breast cancers (27).
All ligands used in this study, AP1510, TGFa (or EGF), and
heregulin, stimulated FKBP–HA cell growth. Interestingly,
trastuzumab was only effective at inhibiting AP1510-stimulated, HER2 homodimer–induced cell growth (Fig. 2). This
action correlated with the ability of trastuzumab to induce
dissociation of Shc from HER2 homodimers and subsequent
inhibition of pErk1/2 (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with earlier
reports supporting trastuzumab-mediated inhibition of both
cell growth and Erk1/2 in cell lines (47). Furthermore,
published clinical data from Mohsin and colleagues have
shown that in HER2-overexpressing primary human tumors,
levels of pErk1/2 but not pAKT as assessed by immunohistochemistry of tumor sections are reduced by treatment
with trastuzumab given alone (48). Of note, TGFa- and
heregulin-induced Erk1/2 activation was resistant to trastuzumab. Moreover, HER2 heterodimer–induced growth
was resistant to the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 (Fig. 4C and
D), likely due to the simultaneous activation of AKT, which
was not observed with AP1510. These data also suggest that
HER2 homodimer–induced growth is sensitive to trastuzumab because of the inability of these dimers to potently
activate the prosurvival AKT pathway. These results imply
that because of the more limited signaling output, HER2þ
tumors with high levels of HER2 homodimers may exhibit a
better outcome than tumors in which HER2 is predomi-

nantly in a hetero-oligomeric conformation as supported by
the data shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.
An implication of these results is that clinically applicable
assays that measure the oligomeric conformations of HER2 in
HER2þ tumors will help predict the odds of response to
trastuzumab. Indeed, in a cohort of patients bearing metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, higher HER2 homodimer levels measured with a proximity-based, antibodydependent HER2 dimer detection assay correlated with better
clinical outcome following therapy with trastuzumab and
chemotherapy (Fig. 6). We realize that the results of this
analysis are limited by the small size of the patient cohort,
the retrospective nature of the study, and the heterogenous
chemotherapy with which patients were treated. Furthermore,
the cutoff value used to distinguish between high and low
HER2 homodimer levels applied to the outcome analysis was
derived from the same cohort. As such, the observed relationships and derived cutoff values will require validation in an
independent cohort before being regarded as widely useful.
However, consistent with our observations from in vitro
experiments, this data set suggests that trastuzumab has
preferential activity against tumors driven predominantly
by HER2 homodimer–induced signaling. Whether the converse is true with assays measuring HER2-containing heterodimers will require further investigation.
