BACKGROUND. Lamotrigine, an antiepileptic agent, has been reported as being
effective in reducing symptoms of neuropathy associated with various etiologies.
Based on such data, a multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of lamotrigine on pain and other neuropathic symptoms due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

METHODS. Patients with symptomatic CIPN with symptom scores of either 1) >3
on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) or 2) >1 on the 0-3 the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) neuropathy scale (ENS) were eligible (higher numMD

bers corresponding to greater severity of symptoms in both scales). Patients were
randomly assigned to receive lamotrigine (target dose of 300 mg/day) or placebo
for 10 weeks. Endpoints were measured biweekly.
RESULTS. In all, 131 patients were enrolled. Both groups were well matched at
baseline. Over the 10-week period of the trial, the average pain scores (NRS) for
the lamotrigine and placebo arms declined in both arms, with no statistically significant difference noted between the changes in the 2 groups (0.3 and 0.5 unit
reduction from baseline, respectively; P 5.56). Similarly, decreases in the ENS with
therapy were not statistically different (0.4 and 0.3, respectively; P 5.3). Changes in
other subjective symptom scales were also not found to be statistically different
between the 2 groups. Toxicities were mild and similar in each group.

CONCLUSIONS. The results suggest that lamotrigine is not effective for relieving
neuropathic symptoms in patients because of CIPN. Cancer 2008;112:2802–8.

C

hemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
(CIPN) is a common toxicity of cancer therapy.
CIPN frequently complicates the use of several
classes of chemotherapeutic agents—taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel), platinum-based compounds
(carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin), and vinca
alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine). Because these
drugs are frequently used to treat several prevalent
cancers (eg, colon, lung, and breast), CIPN is relatively common. CIPN has been estimated to afflict
30% to 40% of patients treated with certain chemotherapeutic agents.1–3 CIPN-related symptoms
have negative effects on quality of life and functional
capacity. In addition, the onset of CIPN often results
in reduced doses of chemotherapy, or discontinuation of therapy altogether—likely impacting cancerrelated outcomes in a negative way. Identifying effective therapies for CIPN remains an urgent unmet
need for oncology patients.
Currently available therapy options for CIPN (eg,
opioids or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
[NSAIDs]) are suboptimal because they are only
minimally effective in relieving symptoms (pain and
discomfort) of CIPN and/or result in significant
adverse events. Tricyclic antidepressants and antiepileptics (eg, gabapentin) are often utilized in clinical
practice to treat CIPN; however, clinical trials evaluating the benefits of such therapies for therapy4,5 or
prophylaxis6 of CIPN do not support such use.
Lamotrigine (Lamictal; GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, PA) is an antiepileptic agent that is reported
to inhibit the function of neuronal sodium channels
in a concentration-dependent and voltage-dependent
manner, decreasing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, especially glutamate and aspartate.7–9
Lamotrigine has been suggested as a potentially useful agent for treating pain in neuropathic syndromes,
based on the observation that increased activity of
sodium channels appears to be the basis for hyperalgesia (eg, as suggested by the benefit of sodium
channel inhibitors such as lidocaine on raising the
pain threshold). In normal volunteers lamotrigine
has been demonstrated to raise the threshold to
cold-induced pain compared with placebo.10 At the
time this study was designed, data were available to
suggest a role for lamotrigine in the therapy of pain
from a variety of etiologies, including painful diabetic
neuropathy,11 central poststroke pain,12 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neuropathy,13
and trigeminal neuralgia.14 In addition to these data,
local anecdotal experience of using lamotrigine to
treat patients with CIPN suggested that some
patients appeared to benefit with such therapy, with
a reduction in pain and other symptoms (such as

2803

numbness and tingling). Based on these preliminary
data, a phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled study
was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of lamotrigine
in treating pain and other neuropathic symptoms
resulting from chemotherapy exposure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was conducted after appropriate approval
by the individual Institutional Review Boards in participating North Central Cancer Treatment Group
(NCCTG) institutions. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients. The study drug and placebo were kindly supplied by the manufacturer
(GlaxoSmithKline). No other associated funding for
this study was provided by any private company.

Patient Characteristics
Adult patients with symptomatic CIPN, 1 month
duration, because of neurotoxic chemotherapy (ie,
taxanes [paclitaxel and docetaxel], platinum compounds [carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin], and
vinca alkaloids [vincristine and vinblastine]) were eligible. Patients who were currently receiving chemotherapy, as well as those who had completed therapy
at the time of study entry, were eligible. To be eligible, patients had to report having ‘average’ daily pain
severe enough to have either 1) a rating of 4 using
the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; 0 5 no pain and
10 5 worst pain possible), or 2) >1 using the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group neuropathy scale (ENS;
0 5 none; 1 5 mild paresthesias, loss of deep tendon
reflexes; 2 5 mild or moderate objective sensory loss,
moderate paresthesias; 3 5 severe objective sensory
loss or paresthesias that interfere with function). Serum creatinine 1.5 times the upper limit of normal
and an estimated life expectancy of 6 months were
required. Patients were ineligible if they had preexisting symptomatic neuropathy because of other causes
(eg, radiation or malignant plexopathy, lumbar or
cervical radiculopathy, vitamin B12 deficiency or diabetes), or if they were pregnant or lactating. Patients
using the following agents at baseline were ineligible:
antidepressants, opioids, adjuvant analgesic agents
(eg, anticonvulsants, clonazepam, or mexelitine),
topical analgesics, and amifostine (although therapy
with any of these agents could be initiated after
study entry, if necessary). The use of NSAIDs was
permitted.
Study Design
The study employed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design. Eligible patients were randomly treated with lamotrigine (target dose of 300

2804

mg, based on published data suggesting that this was
an effective dose13) versus an identical-appearing
placebo. Patients were started on a placebo or lamotrigine at a dose of 25 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks,
then 25 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, then 50 mg twice
daily for 2 weeks, then 100 mg twice daily for 2
weeks, and then the dose was escalated to 150 mg
twice daily, at which time therapy continued for 2
weeks. Dose escalation was continued per this
schedule to allow each patient to reach his/her maximum tolerated dose. After a total of 10 weeks, of
therapy from the time of drug initiation, patients
were tapered off the drug/placebo over a 4-week period. If a patient wished to stop sooner for any reason before 10 weeks, they were encouraged to taper
the drug over a 4-week period rather than discontinuing therapy abruptly.

Efficacy Assessment
The primary efficacy measure was patient-reported
‘average’ daily pain over a particular day, as measured using the NRS15,16 and ENS.17 These primary
outcomes, as well as adverse events, were assessed
weekly. Patients were also asked to assign a score for
their ‘worst’ and ‘least’ pain experiences on the day
of evaluation using the NRS. Because CIPN results in
a spectrum of symptoms (several of which are
related to, but are distinct from pain), several additional secondary measures were utilized to evaluate
for changes in these symptoms. These secondary efficacy measures included: 1) the World Health Organization (WHO) classification scale for neuropathyrelated symptoms (0-4; 0 5 none; 1 5 paresthesias
and/or decreased tendon reflexes; 2 5 severe paresthesias and/or mild weakness; 3 5 intolerable paresthesias and/or marked motor loss; 4 5 paralysis)18;
2) the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire
(assesses different characteristics of neuropathic pain
such as throbbing, gnawing, shooting, aching, and
burning)19; 3) the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form
(BPI; assesses pain and its effects on functional abilities)20; 4) the Subjective Global Impression of
Change (SGIC; a 7-point scale which rates the
change in overall status of symptoms since the beginning of the study with choices of ‘much
improved,’
‘moderately
improved,’
‘minimally
improved,’ ‘no change,’ ‘minimally worse,’ ‘moderately worse,’ or ‘much worse’)21; 5) the Symptom Distress Scale (a 5-point scale which evaluates a range
of symptoms commonly encountered by cancer
patients)22; 6) the Profile of Mood States (POMS)
Short Form (a 30-item scale to assess mood states)23;
7) a quality of life (QOL) Uniscale (a single-item
measurement of global QOL on a numerical analog

scale from 0 to 100)24; and 8) the Neuropathy Pain
Scale (NPS)25 (a 10-point scale that evaluates several
specific pain qualities). These secondary measures
and adverse events were assessed prospectively by
biweekly phone calls and questionnaires. Toxicities
were graded using the United States National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3).

Statistical Methods
This study was designed to have 60 patients in each
arm to provide 80% power to detect differences in
‘average’ pain scores of 0.57 standard deviation for
each coprimary endpoint (moderate effect size), with
a 2-sided type I error rate of 2.5% to account for the
presence of 2 primary endpoints via a Bonferroni
correction. Patients were stratified by type of neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (vinca alkaloids vs
taxanes vs platinum-based compounds vs combination of 2 or more of the previous agents); age; and
whether the patient was enrolled during chemotherapy versus after completion of therapy. Methods
used to analyze the data in the present study were
similar to those used for previous NCCTG 2-treatment, placebo-controlled trials.26–28 Analytical procedures used in these studies have been compiled into
a specialized computer algorithm by the Mayo Clinic
Cancer Center Statistics Unit for use in crossover studies.29 These routines have recently been augmented
by inclusion of a Bayesian modeling approach involving Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedures and
Gibbs sampling.30

RESULTS
Between February 2004 and March 2005, 131 patients
meeting the study entry criteria were registered. Of
these, there were 4 cancellations and 2 patients were
found to be ineligible. There were 125 eligible
patients randomized to receive lamotrigine (n 5 63)
and placebo (n 5 62). The CONSORT diagram31 is
depicted in Figure 1.
Patients in each arm were generally balanced
with regard to demographic factors and chemotherapy drug(s) responsible for CIPN at baseline (Table
1). The proportion of patients actively receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy at the time of enrollment was
38% and 45% (P 5 .47) for the lamotrigine and placebo arms, respectively, with the others having completed chemotherapy at the time of enrollment. At
the time of study entry, the scores for average pain
using the NRS were 4.2 and 3.6 (P 5 .22), and symptoms using the ENS were 2.0 and 1.9 (P 5 .31) for
the lamotrigine and placebo, respectively. Baseline
symptoms were generally similar in severity when

measured using the other scales; however, a few
minor differences were noted in a few of the secondary measures. For example, patients on lamotrigine
had a higher score on the NPS sensitivity scale
(mean, 3.5, 2.4; P 5 .03) and lower scores on the
Symptom Distress Scale (SDS) insomnia scale (mean,
61, 71; P 5 .05) and SDS nausea frequency scale
(mean, 88, 93.5; P 5 .03). There were no other significant differences in baseline characteristics by treatment arm.
At the end of the 10 weeks of therapy, symptom
severity decreased, without significant differences
between treatment groups. The mean score for average pain using the NRS decreased by 0.3 and 0.5
units (P 5 .56) (Fig. 2) and symptom severity measured by the ENS decreased by 0.4 and 0.3 units (P
5 .36) (Fig. 3) in the lamotrigine and placebo arms,
respectively. Similarly, the changes in the worst and
least pain scores by NRS (20.2 and 0.1) and the
WHO pain scales (20.2 and 20.1) (Fig. 4) were similar between the lamotrigine and placebo arms,
respectively. A few minor differences were noted
between the 2 groups with regard to some of the secondary endpoints; for example, patients on the
placebo arm more often reported a 10% improvement in SDS appearance (27% vs 10%, respectively;
P 5 .01) and NPS hot pain (20.3 vs 0.3, respectively,
P 5 .03 at week 6). These findings likely are the artifacts of multiple testing, and do not appear to be
clinically significant. No other differences were noted
between the 2 groups using any of the other secondary endpoints (ie, SDS, McGill Pain Rating Index,
BPI, QOL Uniscale, and SGI) at any point during
therapy. These results are depicted in Table 2.

stratification factors (eg, those patients still receiving

had a statistically significant different response to
the study drug compared with placebo. Post hoc subset analyses did not reveal any significant differences
in the outcomes between the 2 groups among
patients with the highest symptom scores at baseline.
At the end of the 10 weeks of therapy, 80 (65%) of
those enrolled were receiving therapy; 34 (56%) and
46 (74%) of those randomized to lamotrigine and
placebo, respectively.
Adverse events occurred at relatively equivalent
rates in both groups (Table 3). However, patients
receiving lamotrigine were more likely to go off study
because of refusals or adverse events than were
patients on placebo (33% vs 18%, respectively,
P 5 .06). The most common toxicities that were
grade 2 or more in severity, as reported by those enrolled in the lamotrigine and placebo arms, were:
ataxia (24%; 16%), rash (6%; 5%) constipation (0; 2%),
arthralgia (2% each), dyspepsia (2; 0%), nausea and
vomiting (0; 2%), pruritis (2%; 0), fatigue (2% each), and
headache (0 and 4%), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of any of
these individual toxic events between the 2 groups.

DISCUSSION
Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is a common
and often debilitating toxicity induced by exposure
to several commonly used chemotherapeutic agents.
Whereas much clinical research has focused on
developing therapies for neuropathy from several different etiologies, to our knowledge very little of this

effort has focused on patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapeutic agents.
To our knowledge to date, no single therapeutic modality has been demonstrated to have a benefit when
used to treat and/or prevent CIPN. Identifying an
active and well-tolerated agent to treat CIPN is thus
an unmet need for oncology patients. The identification of such an agent should have a significant positive impact in the management of patients with
CIPN and on the applicability of chemotherapy in
general.
A main strength of this study is the inclusion of
a placebo control arm for an adequate comparison
of drug effect. In the absence of such controlled
comparisons, natural temporal improvement of
symptoms may have been falsely attributed to drug
effect(s). The relatively high proportion of patients
who failed to complete therapy may be noted as a limitation. Although one would have liked to have
seen all of the entered patients complete the entire
planned study program, extensive experience has
repeatedly demonstrated that this is not clinical reality for symptom control studies in oncology. In this

In addition, there are some clinical data (mostly
from small uncontrolled clinical trials) suggesting a
benefit to using lamotrigine for treating pain in normal volunteers or in patients with a variety of neuropathic syndromes.10,12–14,38–46 Conversely, several
other studies have noted either a lack of benefit or
an inconsistent benefit47–49 when lamotrigine was
tested for its benefit in neuropathy, a meta-analysis
of all the placebo-controlled studies published concluding that there were no data to support the utility
of lamotrigine as a therapy for pain syndromes.50
This current trial adds to this literature, with evidence supporting the lack of efficacy of lamotrigine
when used to treat CIPN-related symptoms.

regard, the experience in this study is comparable to
another recently completed study in which gabapentin was tested for its effects on CIPN symptoms.5 In
many aspects, this experience is not unlike regular
clinical practice when instituting a potentially effective (or ineffective) treatment for management of a
symptom, wherein patients who perceive a lack of
benefit choose to stop therapy.
The dose chosen to be tested in this study (300
mg per day) was selected based on efficacy data
from a previous study.13 Subsequent studies have
used a slightly higher dose (400 mg daily) as possibly
being more efficacious. However, a subsequent randomized controlled trial that tested this higher dose
in HIV neuropathy patients was negative.32 Moreover,
the high rate of discontinuation of therapy in this
study (higher in the lamotrigine arm when compared
with placebo) would indicate that a higher dose
would be less well tolerated. Therefore, it appears
unlikely that the lack of efficacy noted in this study
can be attributed to suboptimal dosing.
The suggested benefit of lamotrigine in treating
neuropathic symptoms is based on preclinical studies that suggest that sodium channel inhibitors
reduce signaling caused by neuronal damage.7–9,33–37
