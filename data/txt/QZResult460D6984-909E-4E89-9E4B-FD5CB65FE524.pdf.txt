ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated macrophages accelerate tumor
progression via growth factor release. Therefore, tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs)-initiated signaling cascades are potential therapeutic targets. To better
understand anticancer effects of systemic HCC therapy, we studied sorafenib’s effect
on macrophage function, focusing on macrophage-related growth factor secretion.
We found that dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) is a direct target of miR-101.
Transfection of miR-101 reduced DUSP1 induction in M2 macrophages and prolonged
ERK1/2, p38 and JNK activation, whereas inhibition of miR-101 enhanced DUSP1
expression and decreased ERK1/2, p38 and JNK activation. miR-101 expression was
decreased by sorafenib, and inhibition of PI3K/AKT blocked induction of miR-101 by
LPS in M2 cells. M2 cells with greater TGF-β and CD206 mRNA expression compared
to M1 cells had increased hepatoma growth, metastases and EMT. Sorafenib inhibited
miR-101 expression and enhanced DUSP1 expression and lowered TGF-β and CD206
release in M2 cells, slowing macrophage-driven HCC. Our studies demonstrate miR101 regulates macrophage innate immune responses to LPS via targeting DUSP1.
Sorafenib alters macrophage polarization, reduces TGF-β driven cancer growth,
metastases and EMT in vitro, and partially inhibits macrophage activation in vivo.
Thus, macrophage modulation might explain the anticancer effects of sorafenib.

and promotes cytokines secretion into the TME to
enhance tumorigenesis and metastases [4]. Abundant
TAMs correlate with poor prognosis of solid tumors,
including liver cancer [5]. TAMs typically resemble
a M2-polarization within the functional spectrum of
macrophages, which transmits a series of signaling
cascades leading to mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) activation [6]. MAPKs are highly conserved
serine/threonine protein kinases that include ERKs, JNK/
stress-activated protein kinase and p38 MAPKs. Once
activated, MAPKs phosphorylate downstream protein
kinases and transcription factors, leading to the production
of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6,
and endothelial growth factor (EGF). These inflammatory
mediators facilitate tumor angiogenesis, extracellular

INTRODUCTION
Nearly 500,000 people are diagnosed with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) each year, and their
overall 5-year survival rate is less than 12% [1]. Advanced
liver cirrhosis and impaired liver function are also critical
components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), but
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor
stroma can affect tumor prognosis via participation in
innate and adaptive immunity [2].
TAMs are an infiltrating macrophage subpopulation
derived from circulating monocytes with a M2 phenotype
activated by type 2 T helper cells (Th2) cytokines,
such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) [3]. TME is key to
directing macrophages to express the M2 phenotype

matrix degradation and remodeling, and promote tumor
cell motility [7].
Deactivation of MAPKs is regulated mainly by a
family of MAPK phosphatases [8]. Originally identified
as an immediate early gene, DUSP1 later confirmed to be
a dual-specificity phosphatase and a negative regulator of
MAPKs activities [9–12]. DUSP1-deficient macrophage
cells (M2) have prolonged p38 and JNK/stress-activated
protein kinase activation and enhanced production of
TNF-α and IL-6 compared with wild-type cells [13].
Moreover, DUSP1 knockout mice produce substantially
greater quantities of inflammatory cytokines and have
greater mortality from endotoxic shock [14].
miRNAs are small, highly conserved noncoding
RNAs known to suppress expression of protein-coding
genes through imperfect complementarity with the
3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of target mRNA [15].
Previously, we reported that miR-101 expression is
decreased in HCC tissues and hepatoma cells [16].
Recently, miRNAs have been shown to be involved in
innate immune responses; specifically, in response to
stimulation by LPS or other microbial components, a
rapid increase in selected miRNA expression occurs
and has been observed in monocytic cell lines or mouse
macrophages [17, 18].
Sorafenib is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor
approved for systemic HCC treatment and has become the
standard therapy for patients with advanced HCC. How
sorafenib works is unclear, so we investigated the drug’s
mechanism of action on macrophage-induced tumor
development.
In this study, we investigated the influence
of sorafenib on macrophage polarization and macrophagedependent secretion in vitro, and we explored macrophage
and tumor cell interactions in HCC patients. DUSP1 was
identified to be a target of miR-101, a tumor-related
miRNA that is induced after cellular activation via LPS.
Induction of miR-101 by LPS depends on the PI3K/
AKT pathway. We also observed that miR-101 regulates
sorafenib-induced production of DUSP1 and subsequent
MAPKs activation in macrophages. We thus suggest
the targeting of DUSP1 by miR-101 regulates MAPKs
activation during sorafenib-mediated inhibition of
macrophage-induced hepatocarcinoma growth.

(Figure  1A). CD68 and HLA-DR mRNA expression
confirmed macrophage polarization and differentiation
in both cell types, whereas differential expression of
CD206 indicated an alternative polarization state in M2
macrophages (Figure 1B). Functional polarization into M1
and M2 macrophages resulted in IL-12 or IL-10 dominated
cytokine secretion upon LPS stimulation, respectively.
Shedding of CD206 by M2 macrophages further confirmed
their alternative polarization (Figure  1C). Transforming
growth factor beta (TGF-β) expression was measured in
both polarization states and was markedly increased in M2
cultures (Figure 1D). Proliferation assays in the presence of
macrophage-conditioned culture media were performed to
verify functional relevance of secreted growth factors for
hepatoma cell growth. HepG2 and Huh7 cells proliferated
faster in the presence of M2 compared to M1 macrophage
conditioned cell culture media or unconditioned controls
(Figure 1E). Cell motility was quantified in both cell lines
using a Boyden chamber assay. M2 secreting supernatants
had greater motility relative to M1 and NC in HepG2 and
Huh7 cells (Figure 1F). To investigate invasiveness of the
cells, an in vitro invasion assay was performed. M2 had
more invading cells compared with M1 and NC (Figure 1F).
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial
step in cancer cell metastasis. As shown in Figure 1G, M2
supernatants transfected in HepG2 and Huh7 cells downregulated E-cadherin expression and up-regulated vimentin,
N-cadherin, and fibronectin expression. Thus M1/M2
macrophages are suitable for studying hepatoma progression
in response to macrophage-derived growth factors.

miR-101 represses DUSP1 expression
through 3′-UTR interactions
It is accepted generally that miRNAs exert their
function through regulation of downstream target
gene expression. To examine the effect of miR-101 on
DUSP1 expression, M1 and M2 macrophage cells were
transfected with miR-101 mimics or negative control and
stimulated with LPS. We found that over-expression of
miR-101 caused a significant decrease in DUSP1 mRNA
(as measured by qRT-PCR) and protein level (as measured
by Western blot) in M2 cells (Figure 2A-2B). Next, we
transfected the miR-101 inhibitor or negative control into
M1 and M2 macrophage cells and stimulated with LPS,
the results showed that inhibition of endogenous miR-101
expression resulted in up-regulation of DUSP1 mRNA and
protein level in M2 cells (Figure 2A-2B), but M1 is not
different (data not shown). Thus, to determine putative
miR-101 targets, we performed target prediction analysis
using TargetScan and miRanda prediction programs. To
validate whether DUSP1 is a bona fide target of miR-101,
a human DUSP1 3′-UTR fragment containing wild-type
or mutant miR-101-binding sequence (Figure 2C) was
inserted into a plasmid downstream of a firefly luciferase
reporter gene, and the plasmids were transfected into

miR-101 regulates the LPS-induced activation of
ERK1/2, p38 and JNK and induces production
of TGF-β

Sorafenib inhibits miR-101 expression
and inhibits growth factor expression in
macrophages

Because miR-101 negatively regulates the
expression of DUSP1, which is known as a phosphatase
of MAPKs, we next examined whether miR-101 plays a
role in the activation of MAPKs. M2 macrophage cells
were transfected with miR-101 mimics or miR-101
inhibitor and then stimulated with LPS. Activation of
MAPKs was measured by Western blot. LPS stimulation
induced the expression of DUSP1 protein which peaked
at 60 min, but transfection with miR-101 mimics
markedly inhibited DUSP1 expression and prolonged the
phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and JNK apparently to
60, 90 or 120 min (Figure 2E). In contrast, treatment of cells
with miR-101 inhibitor enhanced the expression of DUSP1
and attenuated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and
JNK (Figure 2E). These results suggest that miR-101 may
regulate the LPS-induced activation of ERK1/2, p38 or
JNK through targeting DUSP1. Because miR-101 has been
shown to regulate the expression of DUSP1 and subsequent
activation of MAPKs, we then examined whether miR101 regulates TGF-β production. M1 and M2 cells were
transfected with miR-101 mimics and then stimulated with
LPS and TGF-β was measured with ELISA. Figure 2F
shows that miR-101 mimics increased TGF-β up to 1.7-fold
in M2 cells compared with control treatment, and M1 cells
were not different (data not shown).

Sorafenib is one of the most effective anti-cancer
drugs that inhibit activation of MAPKs. To examine
whether sorafenib alters miR-101, M2 cells were treated
with LPS, LPS plus sorafenib, or sorafenib only for
different time periods. After LPS stimulation, treatment
sorafenib markedly increased DUSP1 expression and
attenuated activation of ERK1/2, p38 and JNK (Figure 4A).
Also, treatment with sorafenib inhibited LPS-stimulated
activation of PI3K/AKT and the LPS-induced
expression of miR-101(Figure 4B). So, up-regulation of
DUSP1 by sorafenib may correlate with down-regulation
of miR-101 due to AKT inhibition. We then measured the
effect of miR-101 mimics on the up-regulation of DUSP1
by sorafenib in LPS-stimulated  M2 cells. Figure  4C
indicates that treatment with miR-101 mimics and
sorafenib inhibited induction of DUSP1 in LPS-stimulated
M2 cells. Therefore, part of the anti-inflammatory effect
of sorafenib may occur through inhibition of LPS-induced
activation of PI3K/AKT, reducing miR-101 expression and
subsequent induction of DUSP1 to deactivate MAPKs.
Treatment of M2 macrophages with increasing sorafenib
concentrations decreased TGF-β and CD206 mRNA
expression (Figure 4D-4E). In line with mRNA expression
data, TGF-β and CD206 protein was suppressed in
M2 macrophage culture-derived media by sorafenib
(Figure  4F-4G). The decrease in CD206 also indicated
a reversion of alternative macrophage polarization,
particularly because LPS-stimulated IL-10 secretion
(Figure 4H) by M2 macrophages was reduced in favor of
a classical IL-6 response after addition of sorafenib in a
dose-and time-dependent fashion (Figure 4I-4J). However,
M1 macrophages did undergo cytokine induction and
macrophage morphology did not change during sorafenib
treatment.

The PI3K/AKT pathway regulates the induction
of miR-101 by LPS
Stimulation by LPS triggers the activation of
multiple signaling pathways. Treatment of M2 cells with
LPS enhanced miR-101 expression in a time-dependent
manner that reached a peak in ~90 min (Figure 3A).
We next analyzed pathways regulated after LPS-stimulated
induction of miR-101 using different kinase inhibitors. PI3K/
AKT inhibitor LY294002, ERK inhibitor PD98059, p38
inhibitor SB203580 or JNK inhibitor SP600125 specifically
inhibited corresponding kinase. M2 cells were pretreated
with inhibitors and then stimulated with LPS and miR-101
expression was measured with qRT-PCR. Only inhibition
of PI3K/AKT by LY294002 markedly attenuated LPSinduced expression of miR-101. Treatment with SB203580,
SP600125, or PD98059 did not have a significant effect on
miR-101 induction by LPS (Figure 3B-3F). Furthermore,
upon LPS stimulation, treatment with LY294002 increased
production of DUSP1 and shortened activation of ERK1/2,
p38 and JNK (Figure 3G, 3I). Specific inhibition of AKT
by siRNA also gave similar results (Figure 3H, 3J). Thus,
part of the effect of miR-101 may occur through inhibition
of LPS-induced activation of PI3K/AKT, thus reducing
expression of miR-101 and subsequently inducing DUSP1
to deactivate MAPKs.

Sorafenib inhibits HCC progression
through TGF-β
We measured HepG2 and Huh7 cells growth in
the presence of media derived from sorafenib pretreated
M1 and M2 macrophage cultures in a time course
experiment to understand the effect of sorafenib treatment
on growth factor release by macrophages. Macrophage
medium was exchanged after sorafenib treatment to avoid
direct inhibitory effects on hepatoma cells. Pretreatment
with sorafenib (5 μg/ml) reduced M2-induced Huh7 and
HepG2 cells proliferation during the 8 days period. Thus,
sorafenib had a dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect.
Inhibition of the growth promotion reached 47.0 + 12.0%
(mean + SD) and 64.0 + 5.5% (mean + SD). In contrast,
no relevant effects on M1 macrophage-driven growth
induction were observed (Figure 5A-5D). Sorafenib

in M2 supernatant showed a significant decrease in the
number of invading cells compared with the control in
HepG2 and Huh7 cells (Figure 5E). Sorafenib upregulated
the epithelial marker E-cadherin and downregulated
the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin
(Figure 5F).
We performed supplementation experiments to
determine which growth factor blocked by sorafenib
was essential for M2 macrophage-promoted hepatoma
cell growth. Supplementation of TGF-β to the medium
of sorafenib-treated M2 macrophage cultures restored
HepG2 and Huh7 cells proliferation (Figure 5G). To
confirm the contribution of M2 macrophage-derived
TGF-β signaling on hepatoma cell growth, we performed
TGF-β receptor blocking experiments using the specific
phosphorylation inhibitor LY2157299. As expected,
TGF-β and M2 macrophage culture supernatant induced
HepG2 cells growth and TGF-β phosphorylation. Most
importantly, inhibition of TGF-β receptor phosphorylation
reduced HepG2 cells proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 5H). LY2157299 elicited its effect at low
concentrations, minimizing potential off-target activity.
From these experiments, we conclude that sorafenib
inhibits macrophage release of TGF-β, a pivotal growth
factor for macrophage-driven hepatoma cell growth and
metastases (Figure 5I–5K).

t­issue ­treated with sorafenib (p < 0.05) (Figure 6B-6C).
­However, the M1 marker HLA-DR showed no difference;
CD206 levels in the non-tumorous tissue were unaltered
after treatment with sorafenib.
Developed HCC with the up-regulation of
TGF-β in liver serum, which implied the essential
role of TGF-β in HCC. Notably, expression of M2
macrophage marker which includes CD206 was also
increased during mice hepatocarcinogenesis and closely
correlated with the up-regulation of TGF-β (R = 0.6123,
p = 0.003) (Figure  6D–6F). The M2 marker CD206 was
significantly decreased in surrounding and tumor tissues of
Sorefenib-treated mice, compared to IgG controls (p < 0.05).
The M1 marker HLA-DR was slightly decreased in sorafenibtreated tumors (Table 2). More importantly, a small portion of
macrophage in DEN-treated mice cirrhotic livers were found
to co-express CD206, indicating that the macrophage may
acquire tumor initiating cell features during carcinogenesis.
These results suggest the importance of TGF-β in the
generation of macrophage during hepatocarcinogenesis.

Macrophage and secreted TGF-β clinically
correlated with HCC
The presence of M2-polarized TAMs in HCC tissue
was measured using CD206 specific stains of curatively
respected HCC. Because truncated CD206 is shed into
serum by activated macrophages during inflammation,
it can serve as a biomarker for M2 macrophage response
in vivo (Figure 7A). We concluded that M2 cells were
activated in HCC patients. As expected, interestingly,
CD206 were scarcely expressed in non-tumors but
highly expressed in HCC along with up-regulated TGF-β
(Figure 7B). Analysis of CD206 and TGF-β expression
has referential significance for clinical gene-targeted
therapy. Increased CD206 expression in liver cancer
indicates a poor prognosis (Table 3). Furthermore, TGF-β
levels were positively correlated with CD206 expression
in HCC, implying the effect of CD206 and TGF-β on the
transformation of HCC (R = 0.57, p = 0.002) (Figure 7C).

Effects of Sorafenib on macrophage cells in vivo
To explore the role of sorafenib in hepatocarcinogenesis, we examined the status in the livers of mice
­administrated with DEN. Treatment with sorafenib as
monotherapy significantly decreased HCC burden compared to IgG controls (p < 0.01) (Table 1).Treatment
with sorafenib improved survival (p < 0.05) (Figure 6A).
The M2 marker CD206 was significantly decreased in
the tumor tissue (p = 0.012), and down-regulation of
TGF-β ­occurred in HCC tissue treated with sorafenib
(p  =  0.02). A  significant down-regulation of vimentin and u
­ p-regulation of E-cadherin were seen in HCC

Considering the consistent results of DEN-induced mice
hepatocarcinogenesis, we speculated that the macrophage
cells may undergo malignant transformation towards
HCC, where the unique TGF-β exposure may play an
important role.

induced, and it returns to basal levels quickly [28]. It is
a critical negative regulator of macrophage signaling in
response to inflammatory stimuli and is responsible for
switching off the production of proinflammatory cytokines
and its expression has been found to correlate with cancer
development and progression. Up-regulation of DUSP1 in
the early phase of cancer helps the tumor to evade JNK1induced apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of DUSP1
allows for proliferation and increased tumor mass in the
more advanced stages of tumorigenesis [29].
Previously, we reported that miR-101 was frequently
down-regulated in HBV-positive HCC tumor tissues
compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues, suggesting
that miR-101 may play a tumor-suppressive role in HCC
development. Here, we found that DUSP1 is a direct target
of miR-101 and that stimulation of the LPS-activated
PI3K/AKT pathway to induce miR-101 expression and
that miR-101 expression repressed DUSP1 expression,
prolonging activation of MAPKs. Collectively, our data
suggest an essential role for miR-101 in regulating innate
immune responses to LPS stimulation. Because miR-101
expression is inhibited by sorafenib, repression of DUSP1
by miR-101 may be a general mechanism by which
proinflammatory cytokine production is regulated by LPS.
Therefore, sorafenib differential regulation of MAPKs
phosphorylation strongly suggests that the upstream
regulator may be DUSP1.
PI3K-deficient cells had enhanced p38 activation
and IL-12 production [30]. An explanation for this
may be that PI3K/AKT suppresses p38 activation
through inhibition of upstream regulators, apoptosis
signal-regulating kinase 1, and MEK kinase 3 [31, 32].
Our research shows that M2 cells treated with PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 inhibits LPS-induced activation of
JNK, suggesting PI3K is a positive regulator of MAPKs.
We also observed that inhibition of PI3K by LY294002
or specific inhibition of AKT expression by siRNA
decreases activation of MAPKs. In addition, inhibition

DISCUSSION
Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor that suppresses
HCC growth and represents the sole approved systemic
therapy for HCC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are
promising candidates for TAM-directed therapy [22]
and sorafenib is a standard palliative treatment for HCC
[23]. TAMs located in the tumor microenvironment
increase HCC progression, TAMs thereby foster tumor
cells proliferation and tumor spread. Interestingly, the
macrophage M2 phenotype resembled by TAMs changed
under sorafenib treatment. Sorafenib treatment reversed
alternative macrophage polarization, indicated by a
shift of phenotypic or functional markers (IL-6, IL-10
and CD206), towards a classical M1 polarization state.
In serum samples from HCC patients, elevated CD206
indicated a M2-type macrophage activation, which, along
with CD206 release is correlated with unfavorable clinical
outcomes of HCC.
Sorafenib blocks different tyrosine kinases, such as
Ras, Raf and ERK, inhibiting proliferation and survival
of tumor cells in addition to anti-angiogenic effects, these
effects promote HCC regression [24]. In response to the
stimulation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns,
MAPKs are activated rapidly, leading to the production of
proinflammatory cytokines [25]. Therefore, the threshold
and magnitude of MAPKs activation must be tightly
controlled to modulate inflammatory responses. Sorafenib
subverts immune responses by mitigating MAPKs [26].
DUSP1 preferentially dephosphorylates activated
p38 and JNK relative to ERK1/2 [27]. In LPS-stimulated
macrophages, DUSP1 is transiently expressed and rapidly

of PI3K enhances DUSP1 expression. Moreover, cells
treated with LY294002 markedly attenuated miR-101
expression induced by LPS. Thus, PI3K may function
as a positive regulator of innate immune responses, and
the discrepancy may be due to different cell types used or
different experimental conditions. We observed that PI3K/
AKT regulates miR-101 expression, thereby up-regulating
DUSP1. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT by PI3K inhibitors
suppressed miR-101 induction by LPS, leading to
enhanced DUSP1 production and subsequent p38 and JNK
inhibition. Thus, PI3K/AKT likely negatively regulates
DUSP1 expression through induction of miR-101.
Previously, we noted that TGF-β was an inducer
of early hepatic dysplasia and HCC growth, suggesting
clinical relevance. TGF-β is the most potent hepatic profibrogenic cytokine produced by activated mesenchymal
cells upon chronic liver damage [33] and it is suggested to
be a multifunctional cytokine that exerts biological effects
on tissue and organ development, cellular proliferation,
differentiation, survival, and apoptosis [34]. TGF-β is
thought to be a link among chronic injury, cirrhosis, and
HCC [32]. Accumulating evidence indicated that TGF-β
modulates expression of numerous genes relevant to
tumor development [35], so it is thought to have a central
role in the EMT, a critical cellular event during tumor
metastasis [36]. HCC usually occur in cirrhotic livers in
which TGF-β is highly expressed compared with healthy
controls, indicating a possible pro-oncogenic role of
TGF-β in HCC initiation [35]. If the effect of miR-101
is solely through DUSP1, then TGF-β regulation may be
an early observation. However, we found that miR-101
had no such effect on TGF-β secretion in the first 24 h,
whereas TGF-β production was substantially higher
in cells transfected with miR-101 at 72 h. Therefore,
miR-101 also may regulate TGF-β production via

targeting expression of other genes. Macrophages are a
relevant source of active TGF-β, which can be targeted by
sorafenib. We postulate that sorafenib-triggered changes
of macrophage polarization are responsible for reduced
TGF-β secretion and macrophage-induced HCC growth.
Accordingly, complete macrophage marker depletion
improved tumor response to sorafenib in HCC harboring
mice. In our study serum CD206 which is an indicator of
macrophage activation decreased after sorafenib treatment
in vivo and positively correlated with TGF-β.
In summary, sorafenib alters the function of
M2-polarized TAMs and reduces TGF-β-driven HCC
progression. miR-101 directly targets DUSP1 to regulate
MAPKs activation and subsequent cytokine production in
response to LPS stimulation (Figure 8). These data suggest
a complexity of signal transduction pathways involved
innate immune responses to sorafenib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
CD14+/- monocytes were isolated from
PBMC by magnetic bead positive selection
(Miltenyi  Biotec)  and  cultured in the presence of
800 U/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) (Bayer Healthcare) for one week to
generate M1 macrophages, and 100 ng/ml macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (Peprotech) for one
week to generate M2 macrophages. Macrophage medium
(RPMI 1640, Gibco) was supplemented with FBS (10%),
L-glutamine (1%), penicillin (1%) and streptomycin (1%)
(Invitrogen). HepG2 and Huh7 cells were maintained
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells
were maintained in a humidified 37°C incubator with an

atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transfections were performed
with Lipofectamine 2000 kit (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Double-stranded miR101 mimics, single-stranded miR-101 inhibitor, or their
relative negative control RNA (GenePharma, Shanghai,
China) was introduced into cells at a final concentration
of 50 nM.

After one week of differentiation, sorafenib was added to
the cell culture medium of monocyte-derived macrophages
for 24 h, followed by a medium exchange and addition of
serum-free macrophage medium for 24 h. Cell viability
and number was calculated via CCK-8 assay according to
instructions provided by the supplier. Substrate turnover
after standardized incubation (3 h) was analyzed with
a photometer. Serum-free macrophage medium was
conditioned in the presence of M1 or M2 macrophage
cultures for 24 h. Conditioned medium was transferred to
cultured HepG2 and Huh7 cells seeded in a flat-bottom
96 well-plate (1, 000 cells/well) one night before growth
kinetic assessment. Conditioned or unconditioned control
media was exchanged every 48 h and cell growth was
measured by CCK-8 assay. The TGF-βphosphorylation
inhibitor LY2157299 (Novartis Pharma) was added to the
transferred media in concentrations indicated. Macrophage
cultures were stimulated with 1 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) (Invitrogen) for 3 h. Recombinant TGF-β
(Peprotech) was added in concentrations as indicated.

Reverse transcription and qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using
the M-MLV Reverse Transcription System (Promega).
Stem-loop reverse transcription for mature miR-101 and
U6 primers was performed as previously described [16].
U6 RNA was used as a miRNA internal control. The
primers used for stem loop reverse-transcription PCR for
miR-101 were purchased from RIBOBIO (Guangzhou,
China). qRT-PCR was performed using a standard
SYBR-Green PCR kit protocol on a StepOne Plus system
(Applied Biosystems, CA), and β-actin was used as the
endogenous control to normalize the relative amount
of total mRNA in each sample. The primer sequences
are summarized in Table 4. qRT- PCR reactions were
performed in triplicate and included no-template controls.
Relative expression was calculated using the comparative
Ct method.

Migration and invasion assay
Boyden chamber Matrigel cell invasion assays
were performed following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were plated into cell culture inserts
with microporous filters (BD, U.S.) coated with (invasion)
or without (migration) Matrigel and incubated. After
incubation for 48 h, the invaded cells at the bottom of
the membrane were stained and counted under a light
microscope.

ELISA
After stimulation at indicated time points, cell
supernatants were collected and analyzed using a
Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems) according to the
manufacturer’s Instructions.

Luciferase reporter assay
For the luciferase reporter assay, 4 × 103 293T cells
were plated in each well of a 96-well plate. The cells were
co-transfected with miR-101 mimics or negative control
RNA at a final concentration of 50  nM  and  10  ng  of
either  pmiR-RB-REPORT™-DUSP1–3′-UTR-WT or
pmiR-RB-REPORT™-DUSP1–3′-UTR-MUT (RIBOBIO,
Guangzhou, China) using the calcium phosphate

Cell proliferation assay
Sorafenib (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA)
was dissolved in DMSO and was further diluted to
0.01%v/v in cell culture medium to a final concentration
of 1.2–5 μg/ml. Mock controls were DMSO (0.01% v/v).
