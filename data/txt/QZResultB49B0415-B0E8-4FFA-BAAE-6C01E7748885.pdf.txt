Abstract
Iodide uptake in the thyroid and breast is mediated by the
sodium/iodide symporter (NIS). NIS activation is used for
radioiodide imaging and therapeutic ablation of thyroid
carcinoma. NIS is expressed in >70% of breast cancers but at
a level insufficient for radioiodine treatment. All-trans
retinoic acid (tRA) induces NIS gene expression and functional
iodide uptake in human breast cancer cell lines and mouse
breast cancer models. tRA usually regulates gene expression
by direct interaction of RA receptor (RAR) with a target gene,
but it can also act through nongenomic pathways. We report a
direct influence of tRA treatment on the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K) signal transduction pathway that mediates
tRA-induced NIS expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
MCF-7 cells express all three RAR isoforms, A, B, and ;, and
RXRA. We previously identified RARB and RXRA as important
for NIS induction by tRA. Treatment with LY294002, the PI3K
inhibitor, or p85A knockdown with siRNA abolished tRAinduced NIS expression. Immunoprecipitation experiments
and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay showed a direct
interaction between RARB2, RXRA, and p85A. RA also induced
rapid activation of Akt in MCF-7 cells. Treatment with an Akt
inhibitor or Akt knockdown with siRNA reduced NIS expression. These findings indicate that RA induction of NIS in MCF7 cells is mediated by rapid activation of the PI3K pathway and
involves direct interaction with RAR and retinoid X receptor.
Defining these mechanisms should lead to methods to further
enhance NIS expression, as well as retinoid targets that
influence growth and differentiation of breast cancer. [Cancer

Introduction
The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) is a transmembrane
glycoprotein that transports iodide into the thyroid to maintain
adequate thyroid hormone production (1). NIS is expressed on the
basolateral membrane of alveolar cells in lactating mammary
gland, concentrating iodide in milk, but is not expressed in the
nonlactating breast (2–4). It has been reported that >70% of breast
cancer tissue expresses NIS, although the level of basal iodide
transport is very low (3, 4). A variety of approaches have been used
to enhance functional NIS expression in breast cancer, with the

goal of using radioiodide to image and treat some differentiated
breast cancer (5). Our previous studies have shown that all-trans
retinoic acid (tRA) significantly induces NIS gene expression and
iodide uptake in human breast cancer cell line and breast cancer
mouse models, but the precise mechanism has not been
established (6, 7).
Retinoids, active metabolites of vitamin A, comprise both
naturally occurring and synthetic compounds that have been used
in animal models and humans as differentiation agents for various
types of cancers, including breast cancer and promyelocytic
leukemia (8, 9). The classic retinoid pathway involves the ligandactivated nuclear receptors, RA receptors (RAR) and retinoid X
receptors (RXR; ref. 9). Both RAR and RXR have three isoforms, a,
h, and g. RAR-RXR heterodimers bind to RA or retinoid X-response
element and activate transcription (9, 10). Many hormones
classically acting through nuclear receptors, however, have been
shown to also act through nongenomic pathways (11, 12). It has
been reported that nuclear receptors can initiate second messenger
production and interact with other cellular systems (11–13). The
mechanism of rapid nuclear receptor signaling, however, is not
established and a variety of models have been described (12, 13).
We have recently studied the human NIS gene and directly
characterized 44 kb of upstream and downstream sequence but
could not identify a functional RA response element (14). We used
signal transduction inhibitors to show that RA induction of NIS is
likely to be through a nongenomic pathway (14). Signal transduction pathways have been implicated by several studies of NIS
expression in breast cancer (15, 16).
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway influences cell growth, cell survival, and cell movement, and signaling
defects have been identified in a wide spectrum of human cancers
(17, 18). PI3Ks are a family of enzymes and can be subdivided
into three classes—class I, II, and III (19). Class IA PI3Ks are
heterodimers of regulatory and catalytic subunits (18, 19). A
regulatory subunit of class IA PI3Ks, p85a, is a phosphoprotein
substrate of many cytoplasmic and receptor tyrosine kinases
(17, 19). Members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as the
estrogen, thyroid hormone, and RARs, have been shown to interact
with p85a, and activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (20–23).
We have investigated the mechanism of tRA induction of NIS. We
show that rapid activation of PI3K/Akt by RA induces NIS
expression in MCF-7 cells. We also show that this rapid activation
of PI3K/Akt pathway is initiated by a direct interaction between
p85a and RARh, in association with RXRa.

according to the recommended conditions. In the perfomance of
immunoprecipitation, Akt phosphorylation, and cell fractionation studies,
cells were serum-starved in phenol red–free DMEM for at least 24 h, and
then treated with 1 Amol/L tRA for the indicated time.
Reagents and antibodies. tRA and 9cRA were purchased from Sigma.
LY294002 and Akt inhibitor VIII were purchased from EMD Biosciences.
Antibodies for phosphorylated S473 Akt, total Akt, h-actin, and PARP were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. RXRa antibody was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p85a antibody was purchased from
Millipore. FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma. NIS antibody was
a gift from Dr. Nancy Carrasco (Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
Bronx, NY).
Western blot analysis. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described
previously (21) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with
ice-cold PBS and lysed with cell lysate buffer (Tris-HCl [20 mmol/L (pH
7.4)], EDTA [10 mmol/L], NaCl [100 mmol/L], Nonidet P-40 [1%], sodium
deoxycholate [5%], Na3VO4 [1 mmol/L], sodium PPi [2.5 mmol/L],
h-Glycerolphosphate [1 mmol/L], and the protease inhibitor cocktail
[Sigma]). Cells were sonicated for 20 s, centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 g at
4jC. Supernatant was collected and 2 sample buffer was added, then
incubated at 95jC for 5 min. Membrane fraction was prepared as previously
described (6). Protein concentrations of the samples were measured using
the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Western blot was performed as
described previously (24), except the protein was visualized by ECL Western
blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). For the same
experiment, membranes were stripped with a stripping buffer (Pierce) and
immunoblotted with another antibody.
Immunoprecipitations. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed
with cell lysate buffer. Immunoprecipitating antibody was added to equal
amounts of cell lysates (3–5 mg) in 1 mL of lysis buffer for 12 h at 4jC
rotating. Then, 40 AL of 1:1 Protein-A agarose was added and rotated for
another 3 h at 4jC. The immunoprecipitates were washed with an ice-cold
lysis buffer for 5 times, then resuspended in a sample buffer and incubated
at 95jC for 5 min. The bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot
analysis. The FLAG-IP, anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) was used and
immunopreciptiation was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. Glutathione S-transferase
(GST) fusion protein was expressed in BL21 bacteria cells and purified using
standard techniques. For the pull-down assays, bovine recombinant GSTp85a fusion protein or GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads was
suspended in 500 AL of AM-1 Buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20%
Glycerol, 100 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L DTT, and 0.2 mmol/L EDTA] and
incubated with 1 Ag human recombinant RXR (Active Motif) for 1 h at 4jC.
The samples were washed 5 times with ice-cold PBS, then resuspended in a
sample buffer and incubated at 95jC for 5 min. The bound proteins were
analyzed by Western blotting.
Reverse transcription-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR analysis.
Total RNA isolation, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and real-time PCR
analysis were carried out as previously described (5, 7). Sequences of PCR
primer pairs for RARhs, p85a, and Akts are shown in Supplementary Data.
Primers for NIS and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
have been described previously (5).
Plasmid constructs. pcDNA3.0-RARh2 and FLAG-RARh2 were subcloned from pCMX-RARh2 into HindIII-BamHI site of pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen)
and p3XFLAG-14 vector (Sigma), respectively. For RARh4, inserts were
created by PCR amplification of cDNA obtained from the breast cancer cell
line, Hs578T. cDNA was obtained as described above. Primers used for
cloning are as follows: 5¶-CAAGCTTAGCGCCTGTGAGGGATGTAAG-3¶
( forward primer), 5¶-ACTCGAGAAGGTACTGGGGAATGTTTGAAGTAG-3¶
(reverse primer). TOPO-Cloning kit was used and performed according to
the manufacturer’s manual. RARh4 construct was then subcloned into
HindIII-XhoI site of pcDNA3.0. Because there was another ATG site at
nucleotide 411, 37 bp 5¶ of the RARh4 transcription start site at nucleotide
448, the ATG site at 411 was modified to TTG by in vitro site-directed
mutagenesis using PCR. Primer used for mutagenesis was 5¶-GAAAAAGCCCTTACAACCCTCACAGGCGCT-3¶. pCMX-RARh2 was a gift of

RA Induces NIS by PI3 Kinase Activation in MCF-7 Cells
Small interfering RNA preparation. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA)
targeting RARb2 gene were designed and were chemically synthesized by
Dharmacon RNA Technologies. The sequences for siRNAs are as follows:
GTATGGATGTTCTGTCAGT and GGATTTCTACACTGCGAGT. Nontargeting control siRNA (SMARTpool control) and predesigned siRNAs against
RXRa, p85a, Akt1, and Akt2 (siGENOME siRNA) were also purchased from
Dharmacon.
Transfection. Plasmids were transfected into MCF-7 cells and COS-7
cells with Effectene and Polyfect (Qiagen), respectively. siRNAs were
transfected into cells at a final concentration of 100 nmol/L by using
transfection reagent, DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon). Transfection was
performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Iodide uptake. The iodide uptake assay was performed as described
previously (5). The uptake was normalized to the cellular protein
concentration measured with Bio-Rad protein assay.
Statistical analysis. For statistical analysis, one-factor ANOVA followed
by the Scheffe’s F test was used. Values were expressed as means F SD, and
P value of <0.01 was considered significant. All the experiments were
performed with at least three replicates.

Results
Response to natural and synthetic retinoids. We used
isoform-specific retinoid receptor ligands to characterize the
isoform specificity of tRA induction of NIS expression. We have
reported previously that an RAR h/g agonist was the most potent
retinoid stimulator of NIS expression (5). We extended these
studies and performed iodide uptake and NIS mRNA expression

with the RAR a/h agonist, Am80, a pan-RAR agonist, Re80, and
pan-RXR agonists, PA024 (Fig. 1A and C). Although a natural panRAR agonist, tRA, and a natural pan-RAR/RXR agonist, 9cRA,
induced iodide uptake and NIS mRNA expression to the greatest
level of expression, Am80 induced NIS to a similar level as Re80.
This result, along with those from our previous study (5), indicates
that RARh plays the major role in NIS induction by tRA. In
addition, we performed iodide uptake after treatment with an RAR
antagonist, LE540, and an RXR antagonist, HX531. Interestingly,
both LE531 and HX531 blocked tRA-stimulated iodide uptake
(Fig. 1B). The RXR antagonist, HX531, is known to selectively
inhibit the activity of RAR-RXR heterodimers (25). Inhibition of NIS
induction by HX531 indicates that heterodimerization of RAR and
RXR is required for the tRA-induction of iodide uptake.
Nuclear receptor RARB2 and RXRA are required for the NIS
induction by tRA in MCF-7 cells. The pharmacologic studies
showed that RARh and RXR are important for tRA-mediated NIS
induction. We further evaluated the role of RARh and RXR by
determining the influence of loss- and gain-of-function experiments on NIS induction. MCF-7 breast cancer cells express RARa,
h, g, and RXRa (26, 27). RARh generates multiple variants by using
two promoters and alternative splicing (26). Variants of RARh have
been identified in human breast cancer cells: h2, h2S, h4, and h5
(Fig. 2A; refs. 26, 28, 29). RARh2 encodes the full-length isoform,
whereas RARh2S, h4, and h5 are truncated variants of RARh2,
and the corresponding sequences are indicated by gray boxes

(26, 28, 29). Two kinds of protein are translated from these variants.
One is the product of RARh2 and h2S, which include the receptor
domains A to F, and the other is the product from h4 and h5, which
lack the A, B, and C domains (Fig. 2A). MCF-7 cells express h2, h2S,
h4, and h5 mRNA as determined by RT-PCR (data not shown). We
stably transfected MCF7 cells with vectors expressing one of the
two RARh protein product variants, either RARh2 or h4, and
performed RT-qPCR of NIS mRNA and iodide uptake (28, 29).
Overexpression of RARh2 significantly increased tRA-induction of
NIS mRNA and iodide uptake (data not shown), whereas RARh4
expression reduced both (Fig. 2B). Selective knockdown of RARh2,
as well as RXRa, significantly decreased RA-induced NIS mRNA
expression in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that tRAinduced NIS expression uses RARh2 and RXRa, likely as
heterodimers, whereas the truncated RARh4 functions as an
inhibitor.
Activation of PI3K is required for NIS induction by tRA. The
specific inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, blocked the induction of NIS
mRNA expression by tRA in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A).
LY294002 treatment also inhibited NIS protein expression on the
membrane in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3B). This is consistent
with our recent study showing that LY294002 blocked the RAinduction of iodide uptake at an IC50 of 7.87 F 1.1 Amol/L (14).

Furthermore, tRA-induction of NIS mRNA did not require de novo
protein synthesis because cotreatment of tRA and cycloheximide
did not influence NIS mRNA expression (data not shown). These
pharmacologic data, as well as our previous studies in which a
functional RA response element was not identified in the NIS gene
locus or adjacent sequences (14), suggest that tRA treatment
induces NIS expression in MCF-7 cells by modulating the PI3K
signal transduction pathway.
We further investigated the involvement of PI3K in NIS
induction by tRA, by using siRNA targeting p85a, one of the
regulatory subunit of class IA PI3Ks. Knockdown of p85a
significantly decreased the NIS mRNA induced by tRA compared
with the control cells (Fig. 3C).
RARB2 and RXRA forms a complex with p85A. To determine
the mechanism of PI3K activation by tRA, we investigated whether
RARh2 and RXRa directly interact with p85a, by performing
coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. Immunoprecipitation experiments using COS-7 cells transfected with RARh2, p85a,
and RXRa showed a direct interaction between RARh2 and p85a in
a tRA ligand-independent manner (Fig. 4A). Conversely, a similar
stable interaction between RARh2 and p85a was observed with
immunoprecipitation performed with anti-p85a antibody (Fig. 4B).
These finding show direct ligand-independent binding of RARh2

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were

for 30 min. Whole-cell extracts (3 mg) were
immunoprecipitated (IP ) with either anti-FLAG
antibody (A) or anti-p85a antibody (B ) and then

and p85a. We then examined the interaction between RXRa and
p85a in a cell-free system by performing a pull-down assay using
GST-p85a fusion protein. GST-p85a fusion protein bound to the
human recombinant RXRa but GST alone did not. Interestingly,
both pan-RAR and -RXR antagonist inhibited the binding of RXRa
to p85a (Fig. 4D). This is consistent with findings from the
functional studies using pharmacologic antagonists that blocked
tRA-induced NIS expression (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, using the
coimmunoprecipitation assay with endogenous p85a and RXRa
from cell lysates of MCF-7 cells, we found that tRA increases the
association of p85a and RXRa (Fig. 4C).
Akt, downstream of PI3K pathway, is rapidly activated after
treatment with tRA in MCF-7 cells. Several nuclear receptors
have been shown to rapidly activate Akt after PI3K activation. We
determined whether tRA activates Akt in MCF-7 cells. The cells
were serum starved for 24 to 48 hours before tRA treatment.
Treatment with 1 Amol/L tRA rapidly increased Ser-473 phosphorylation of Akt at 5 to 10 minutes and then decreased to the basal
level at 20 minutes (Fig. 5A). Treatment with an Akt inhibitor VIII,
an isozyme-specific inhibitor that inhibits Akt1 and Akt2
selectively, reduced NIS mRNA induced by tRA (Fig. 5B ).
Combining Akt inhibition with PI3 kinase inhibition did not

further reduce NIS mRNA (Fig. 5B). High concentrations of Akt
inhibitor VIII (IC50, 4.5 Amol/L) inhibits tRA-induced iodide uptake
in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5C). Combination treatment of Akt1 and Akt2
siRNAs in MCF-7 cells also decreased tRA-induced NIS mRNA
expression f25%, but it was not a significant reduction (Fig. 5D).
We also performed a selective knockdown of Akt1 or Akt2
separately, but there was a trend in these studies toward increased
NIS mRNA induced by tRA (data not shown).

Discussion
A high fraction, f70%, of breast cancers express NIS, but
functional iodide concentration is rare (3, 4). Selective induction of
NIS provides the potential for developing NIS-mediated radionuclide therapy as a safe and effective treatment for breast cancer.
Baseline iodide transport in breast cancer, however, is insufficient
and stimulation of expression is necessary. Identification of the
mechanism(s) of RA induction of NIS expression is essential to
determine approaches to augment functional uptake. The involvement of signal transduction pathways, including PI3K, in NIS
induction in breast cancer has been suggested by several previous
studies (15, 16). The current study shows that liganded RAR directly

induces the rapid activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to the
activation of a yet unknown transcription factor, which then
induces NIS mRNA expression (Fig. 6).
The activation of PI3K/Akt has been reported by other nuclear
receptors, including estrogen, thyroid hormone, and glucocorticoid
receptors (20–23). Recently, it has been reported that RA can
activate PI3K/Akt pathway through interaction between RARa and
p85a (22, 32). In this study, we have identified a novel liganddependent interaction between RARh2, RXRa, and p85a. Ligand
binding in MCF7 cells facilitates the association of RXRa,
subsequently activating PI3K and Akt. Although we were able to
observe ligand-dependent interaction of RXRa and p85a by
immunoprecipitation assay, we were not able to observe the same
result in GST-p85a pull-down assay. This may be due to the
differences between the in vitro and in vivo conditions. The

interaction between RARh2 and p85a, however, was ligandindependent. This finding is consistent with previous reports
showing the interaction of thyroid hormone receptor and RARa
with p85a (20, 22). Inhibitor for PI3K and Akt, as well as siRNAs for
p85a and Akt1/Akt2, decreased tRA-induced NIS mRNA expression. We have also found that Akt was rapidly phosphorylated
within 5 to 10 minutes after tRA stimulation. These results indicate
that the rapid activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by tRA led to an
increase in NIS mRNA expression and iodide uptake. Several
studies have shown that tRA has a negative effects on PI3K activity
in MCF-7 cells (33, 34). One group showed that long-term
treatment with tRA induced growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells,
mediated by down-regulation of IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway (33). The
different influences of tRA on PI3K may be due to short-term rather
than long-term treatment.

RA Induces NIS by PI3 Kinase Activation in MCF-7 Cells

Figure 6. Model for the mechanisms of retinoid induction of NIS expression in
MCF-7 cells. Factors that stimulate expression are shown with a ‘‘+’’ and
those that inhibit are shown by a ‘‘ .’’ PI3K activation of additional pathways is
likely required for NIS gene expression.

Inhibition of tRA-induction of NIS required high concentrations
of the Akt inhibitor. The IC50 for Akt inhibitor VIII using the in vitro
kinase assay has been reported to be 58 and 210 nmol/L for Akt1
and Akt2, respectively (35). Even the high concentration of Akt
inhibitor VIII, 10 Amol/L, only inhibited NIS mRNA expression by
50%. This indicates that Akt is likely not the only pathway required
for the NIS induction by tRA. Indeed, our previous study using
various kinds of signal transduction inhibitors showed that Janus-

activated kinase, Rac, and p38 inhibitors also partially inhibited the
induction of NIS by tRA (14). Akt inhibition also reduced iodide
uptake, suggesting actions of Akt activation on NIS protein
processing or membrane insertion. The combination knockdown
of Akt1 and Akt2 decreased the NIS expression, but knockdown of
each Akt1 or Akt2 did not decrease but rather increased the tRAinduced NIS mRNA expression. Blocking either Akt1 or Akt2
pathway may activate the other pathway and increase the overall
Akt activation, resulting in an increase in NIS expression.
Growing evidence shows that rapid nongenomic actions of
nuclear receptors are initiated outside the nucleus; however,
considerable controversy about these actions remain (11, 13, 36).
Transfection of a chimeric RARa/c-Src myristylation domain
construct, which was targeted to plasma membrane, in mouse
embryonic fibroblast-RAR(ahg)L /L null cells and COS-7 cells
resulted in strong activation of PI3K/Akt signaling, indicating that
interaction of RARa and p85a can occur at the plasma membrane
(22). The interaction among RARh2, RXRa, and p85a might also
take place in the cytoplasm or near the plasma membrane,
although p85a is localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus.
Phosphorylation of RARa in promyelocytic leukemia cells reduces
transcriptional activation, and RAR/RXR phosphorylation may
influence signal transduction (37). Further studies are required to
determine the underlying mechanism.
Due to their role in the regulation of cell growth and
differentiation in preclinical models, retinoids are being extensively
evaluated in clinical trials of cancer prevention and therapy,
including breast cancer (8). Retinoid receptors are expressed in
normal and malignant epithelial breast cells and are critical for
normal development. It has been suggested that biological effects
of tRA are partially mediated through multiple signal transduction
pathways. These nongenomic actions of RARh may play an
important role in indirectly regulating gene expression, not only
for NIS induction but also for other tRA-regulated influences on
cancer growth and differentiation.
