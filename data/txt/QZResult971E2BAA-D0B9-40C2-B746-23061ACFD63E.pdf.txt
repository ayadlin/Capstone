Abstract:

Previous genetic analyses have suggested that mutations of the genes encoding
PI3Kα facilitate invasion and metastasis but have less effect on primary tumor
growth. These findings have major implications for therapeutics but have not
been factored into pre-clinical drug development designs. Here we show that
the inhibition of PI3Kα by newly designed small molecule inhibitors prevented
metastasis formation in mice but had much less effect on the growth of subcutaneous
xenografts or primary intra-abdominal tumors. These data support the idea that
PI3Kα plays an important role in the metastatic process and suggest a more informed
strategy for selecting drugs worthy of further development for clinical application.

INTRODUCTION

forms of PI3Kα suggest a release of inhibition by its
regulating subunit p85 as well as altered membrane
binding as causes for the observed biochemical over
activity of the mutants [4-8]. The mutational activation
of PI3Kα permits cell survival in culture when growth
factors are limiting [6, 8].
PI3Kα is a heterodimer of a catalytic subunit
encoded by PIK3CA and one of several regulatory
subunits [9]. The high frequency of PIK3CA mutations in
human tumors, the localization of mutations to particular
“hotspot” regions, and the enhanced enzymatic activity of
the mutant gene’s products have made PI3Kα a preferred
target for drug development. Indeed, PI3KCA is one of the
two most highly mutated oncogenes ever discovered (the
other being KRAS). For these reasons, many academic
and industrial groups are attempting to develop inhibitors
of this enzyme [10-21]. There are currently nine PI3K
inhibitors in clinical trials, none of which are particularly

The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K) class
1A family is a critical regulator of growth, motility and
survival functions [1]. PI3K class 1A members transmit
signals from a variety of growth factor receptors, creating
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3
serves as activator and membrane docking station for
PDK1 and Akt proteins, thereby initiating a kinase
cascade that connects the cell membrane receptors with
nuclear transcription factors. In light of its central role
in numerous cellular processes, the phosphorylation of
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is tightly
regulated, with PTEN reversing the phosphorylation of
PIP2 catalyzed by PI3K Class 1A family members.
The alpha isoform of PI3K (PI3Kα) is one of the
most frequently mutated kinases in solid tumors [2, 3].

specific for PI3Kα. These inhibitors can be classified into
six core structures. PX-866 and SF1126 are analogues of
wortmannin and LY294002, respectively, with improved
pharmacokinetic properties [13, 22]. NVP-BEZ235, PF04691502, BGT226 and XL765 are novel compounds
with a broader and more potent inhibition profile that
target PI3Ks as well as mTOR [23-25]. GDC-0941,
XL147 and NVP-BKM120 are potent pan PI3K class 1A
inhibitors lacking mTOR inhibition [26, 27].
Metastases, rather than the primary tumors
themselves, are the cause of death in the vast majority of
cancer patients. Interestingly, cancer cell lines in which the
spontaneously mutated PI3Kα is genetically disrupted still
grow as xenografts in nude mice, though their metastatic
ability is severely compromised [8]. Similarly, cell lines
in which Akt1 and Akt2 are genetically disrupted form
xenografts at their primary sites but do not metastasize
as well as their parental lines [28]. Overexpression of
Akt1 has also been shown to enhance metastasis in rodent
models and Akt2 knockdown inhibited such metastasis
[29]. Clinical evidence of the importance of the PI3K/
Akt pathway in metastasis development has also been
documented [30, 31].
The purposes of the current study were (i) to
introduce a novel set of PI3Kα specific inhibitor analogs
based on an imidazopyridine core, and (ii) to test the most
promising of these compounds for their in vivo activities

against primary andFigure
metastatic
tumors.

Synthesis and structure–activity relationship
(SAR) studies of imidazopyridine-based J-series
compounds
We synthesized 121 compounds based on N’- [(1E)(6-Bromoimidazo [1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)methylene]-N,2dimethyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonohydrazide hydrochloride
(J27), a potent PI3Kα inhibitor reported previously
[14]. Cyclization of 5-bromo-2-aminopyridine with
chloroacetaldehyde gave imidazopyridine, which was
formylated and further reacted with various hydrazines
to provide the key intermediate compound 3. Acylation
or sulfonylation of compound 3 generated the desired
compounds (Supplementary scheme 1). Each of the
compounds was tested for selective biochemical inhibition
of PI3K isoforms in vitro. For this purpose, a baculovirusbased expression system was used to produce the catalytic
and regulatory subunits of PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, and PI3Kδ. In
the case of PI3Kγ, no regulatory subunit was required for
activity [32].
SAR studies began by changing R1 from methyl (J27)
to ethyl (J32). The potency for PI3Kα was retained but
selectivity against the other three isoforms increased by up
to 8-fold (Supplementary scheme 1, Table 1). Increasing

Figure 1: Biochemical activities of selected J-series compounds exemplify their PI3Kα selectivity and potency. Inhibitor
concentration is plotted against relative biochemical activity. Four PI3K isoforms were tested: alpha (red), beta (blue), gamma (green) and delta
(purple). The structures of the compounds are shown above each panel.

had IC50’s below 100 nM and 9 had IC50’s below 20 nM
(examples in Fig. 1). The most specific of these (J171)
had ~670-fold selectivity against PI3Kβ, 60-fold against
PI3Kγ, and 100-fold against PI3Kδ with a potency of 19
nM for PI3Kα (Table 1). More typical selectivity values
were >20 (β), >30 (γ), and >10 (δ), respectively, with a
potency for PI3Kα at 10 nM (e.g. J124). The compounds
were also tested for their capacity to inhibit two common
mutant forms of PI3Kα – E545K and H1047R [2, 33].
None of the compounds discriminated between the wildtype (wt) and mutant forms of the enzyme (data not
shown). Finally, we also tested one of the compounds
(J124, chosen for reasons discussed later) against a panel
of 273 kinases. This compound proved to be moderately
selective, inhibiting 22 of 273 tested kinases, but not
mTOR, with an IC50 of 11 nM or lower (Supplementary
Table 1).

the size of R1 by substituting ethyl (J32) with isopropyl
(J55), iso-butyl (J46) or benzyl (J30) caused a 6 to 49fold drop in inhibitory activity for PI3Kα. Polar groups
such as ester (J43) and nitrile (J47) at R1 did not increase
potency. A switch of the sulfonyl group at X to a carbonyl
(J45) did improve inhibitory activity for PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ
and PI3Kδ, but not for PI3Kα, thus decreased selectivity
for the latter. With respect to the terminal phenyl ring,
deleting a methyl group at R2 (J37) or a nitro group at
R3 (J40) resulted in greater than 3.6-fold and 1333-fold
decreases in inhibitory activity for PI3Kα, respectively.
However, a chloro (J101) substituent at R2 was able to
maintain potency and isoform selectivity as long as a nitro
group was also present at R3. The R3 nitro group turned
out to be critical in this configuration, as substitutions by
various moieties, including carboxylic acid (J100), amino
(J44), amido (J125) and methyl sulfonyl (J41) groups all
impaired potency. We discovered that a substitution at
the R4 position next to the nitro group on the phenyl ring
was beneficial and that the R4 position in general accepted
larger substituents without major impact on potency.
Amino (J124-I), glycino (J159) and trifluoroacetylamino
(J124) groups at the R4 position increased inhibitory
activity for PI3Kα by 7.5, 3.8 and 1.4-fold, respectively,
when compared to J32. Other substitutions, such as fluoro
(J120), hydroxyl (J129) and various amino groups (J157,
J158, J161, J162, J163), did not impact the inhibitory
activity for PI3Kα substantially. Even larger substitutions
as well as oligopeptide adducts retained nanomolar
potencies (e.g. J171).
In summary, seventy-four of the 121 compounds
had a IC50 for PI3Kα below 1 µM, but of these, only 42

J-series compounds inhibit the proliferation of
cancer cells with and without mutant PI3Kα
All 42 compounds with a PI3Kα IC50 below 100
nM were assayed for their ability to inhibit the growth of
HCT116 cells in culture. These cells were derived from a
human colorectal cancer containing one mutant (H1047R)
and one normal allele of the PIK3CA gene. Paired isogenic
lines in which one of the two alleles was disrupted through
homologous recombination have been generated [8] and
were also tested. We found that the 42 compounds inhibited
cell growth to varying extents, but none of them inhibited
the growth of the cells with a mutant PIK3CA allele more
342

Oncotarget 2010; 1: 339 - 348

than their isogenic counterparts with only a normal allele
(example in Fig. 2A). It has previously been demonstrated
that the PIK3CA mutations allow cells to proliferate in
growth medium containing limiting concentrations of
growth factors [2]. Cells with both genotypes were more
sensitive to the compounds when grown under conditions
where growth factors were limiting, but these conditions
did not provide specificity for the cells with a mutant
PIK3CA allele (Fig. 2A)
To identify the most promising drug leads for in
vivo evaluation, a matrix of cellular and biochemical
potency of the 42 compounds with nanomolar IC50’s was
constructed (Fig. 2B). We searched for potent compounds
that inhibited cell growth at concentrations consistent with
their ability to inhibit PI3Kα enzymatic activity. None of
the compounds inhibited growth at concentrations less
than their biochemical Ki. Compounds that did not inhibit
cell growth even at concentrations much greater than their
Ki’s were assumed to be cell impenetrant or inactive in

an intracellular environment. Four compounds (J32, J124,
J124-I, and J128) with biochemical and cellular activities
which we considered optimal were chosen for further
analysis.
To determine whether these compounds inhibited
the pathway regulated by PI3Kα, we evaluated the
phosphorylation of Akt1 and Akt2 in HCT116 cells
following exposure to the compounds for 6 hours. Previous
studies have demonstrated that the Akt1 and Akt2 proteins
are reliable indicators of PI3Kα pathway activity [8, 28].
As assessed by western blot, the four compounds all
inhibited phosphorylation of Akt1 and Akt2 when used at
concentrations that inhibited cell growth (example in Fig.
2C).

inhibitors of metastatic disease
We next tested these compounds in vivo. Through

dose escalation studies, we found that the compounds
were tolerated at concentrations up to 150 mg/kg when
administered intraperitoneally daily for three weeks. Two
of the compounds (J32, J124-I) were evaluated for their
ability to inhibit the growth of subcutaneous HCT116
xenograft tumors in nude mice. Only a minor anti-tumor
activity was noted (Supplementary Fig. 1), even though
the compound inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt1/2 in
the growing tumors (Fig. 2D).

To test the compounds in a context more relevant
to the proposed tumorigenic role of PI3Kα, we evaluated
their ability to inhibit the development of metastases from
tumors injected into the spleen. Such injections give rise to
large, primary intrasplenic tumors and multiple metastatic
lesions in the liver, as well as a few tumor nodules in the
lungs. The tumor-bearing animals were treated daily by
intraperitoneal injections of J124 or J128 at 150 mg/kg
starting three days after tumor implantation. Metastatic

might be useful in the clinic.
The pharmacologic data provided in this study are
in perfect accord with prior genetic data. In particular,
homologous recombination-mediated disruption of a
mutant PIK3CA allele did not inhibit the growth of primary
tumors but did inhibit metastatic growth [8]. No drug could
possibly inhibit the mutant PI3Kα isoform as completely,
permanently, and specifically as a genetic knock-out.
We would thus argue that any drug that is designed to
inhibit this enzyme should yield similar results in vivo,
exhibiting minor effects on primary tumors and major
effects on metastases. And conversely, drugs that inhibit
the growth of primary tumors grown subcutaneously must
be doing so by off-target effects. We believe that most
of the drugs now being considered or used for clinical
trials have not met this straight-forward expectation. On
a positive note, attention to this expectation could lead to
an improved selection of drugs for future clinical trials,
thereby expediting the drug development process.

burdens were assessed through histopathology analysis
three weeks later. All mice had large intrasplenic tumors,
but the mice injected with J124 or J128 had few, if any,
metastatic foci in their livers compared to animals injected
with the vehicle alone (Fig. 3A). Sections of the liver and
lungs revealed multiple tumor foci in control mice but not
in mice treated with J124 or J128 (Fig. 3B).
To quantitatively measure metastatic tumor burdens
in these mice, we performed real-time PCR using humanspecific primers [34]. The spleens of the mice treated
with J124 or J128 showed a modest reduction in primary
tumor burdens (~50%) compared to the mice treated with
only the vehicle (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the metastatic liver
burden was reduced by 13-fold and 9-fold, respectively,
in the mice treated with J124 and J128. There were a few
metastatic lesions in the lungs of the control mice but no
lesions in the lungs of the treated mice.

DISCUSSION

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We describe above a class of inhibitors that are
highly specific for the alpha isoform of PI3K enzymes.
Most published cell biologic and physiologic studies
employing PI3Kα inhibitors have used either wortmannin
or LY290042. These classic compounds have proven
useful but are non-specific with respect to PI3K isoforms.
The compounds we have synthesized should prove
superior for such research purposes and will be made
freely available upon request. Furthermore, the detailed
evaluation of structure activity relationships provides
leads for further optimization of this and related classes
of compounds. Particularly intriguing was the discovery
that the R4 position accepted very large substituents,
even peptides, without major impact on potency. This
finding sets the stage for the development of bi-functional
compounds that may have uniquely specific activities.
Our studies also provide strong pharmacologic
evidence for the role of PI3Kα in metastasis. Apart from
the biologic implications of this finding, it has important
practical ramifications. All anti-cancer compounds,
including those targeting PI3Kα, are tested in pre-clinical
models prior to their introduction into Phase I clinical
trials. In general, therapeutic efficacy against a well-chosen
tumor cell line is required to move forward. For example,
PI3Kα inhibitors might be tested against xenografts of
human cancer cell lines which have mutations of PIK3CA,
for obvious reasons. Our results show that it is not only
the choice of cell line that is important for pre-clinical
testing, but also the choice of the in vivo model in which
the testing is performed. J124 and J128 have little activity
against subcutaneous tumors, or even against intraabdominal primary tumors, but could potently inhibit
the development of metastases. These results suggest
that testing of novel compounds against tumors grown
subcutaneously in immunocompromised mice could be
misleading, stimulating researchers to discard drugs that

PI3K expression and purification
cDNA clones of PIK3CA, PIK3CB and PIK3CG were
obtained from Origene (Rockville, MD, USA). PIK3CD
was generously provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.
The cDNA clones were sub-cloned into pFastBac His-Tag
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and baculovirus clones
were generated by the Bac-to-Bac expression system
(Invitrogen). p110α, p110β and p110δ were co-expressed
in Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) with a nSH2-iSH2 fragment
of the regulatory subunit p85 comprising AA residues 322
to 600 [4]. p110γ was expressed without a regulatory
subunit. Sf9 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM
sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol,
1% Triton X-100, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM
orthovanadate, 10 mM imidazole, and sonicated on ice
for 1 minute. Proteins were purified by adding Ni-NTA
Superflow beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) to the
lysate and subsequent rolling for 30 min at 4oC. Beads
were washed twice with 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0,
0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Imidazole, 2 mM DTT and eluted
in the same buffer but with 200 mM imidazole. Purified
PI3K’s were mixed 1:1 with glycerol and stored at -20oC.

Bromophenol blue, 20 µl 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4,
and Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche,
Nutley, NJ, USA) without EDTA and sonicated for 30
seconds. Phospho-Akt was assayed with Phospho-Akt
(Ser473) antibody (#9271, Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA). Subsequently the membrane was
stripped and incubated with Akt1 (D-17) antibody (sc7126, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,Santa Cruz, CA, USA))
for loading control.

J-series inhibitors were dissolved, serial diluted in
DMSO and deposited into 96 well plates at a final DMSO
concentration of 1%. We used a novel assay to determine
their potency and selectivity. In brief, micelles of 2.5
µg L-a-Phosphatidylinositol and 2.5 µg 1,2-Diacyl-snglycero-3-phospho-L-serine were formed by sonication,
mixed with the individual PI3K isoforms and added to
the drug dilutions in a reaction buffer containing 10 mM
HEPES, 25 mM NaCl, 0.125 µg/µl BSA, and 2 mM
BME (final concentrations). Reactions were timed after
the addition of 10 µM ATP with 40 μCi/ml γ-32P-ATP
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and 2 mM MgCl2
(all final concentrations). The reactions were terminated
after two hours by the addition of 2 N HCl and the lipids
extracted with 1:1 MetOH/Chloroform. Radio-labeled
phosphatidyl-inositol-3-phosphate in the extracted organic
fraction was quantified after the addition of Microscint O
(PerkinElmer) using a TopCount 96 well plate scintillation
counter (PerkinElmer). IC50 concentrations and inhibition
curves were calculated using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA).

Intraspleenic tumor model
Intraspleenic-injected HCT116 liver and lung
metastases in NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ
mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were
generated as described in Erikson et. al. [28]. J-series
compounds were solubilized in 1:1 DMSO/Cremophor
EL (Sigma-Aldrich) and diluted 2.3-fold in water to a final
concentration of 7.5 mg/ml. 400 µl of this formulation (150
mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (IP) once a day for
three weeks, beginning the third day post-surgery. Mice
were sacrificed after the treatment and the liver, lungs,
and spleen sampled. DNA was extracted from organs
with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The qPCR
assay used for quantification of human DNA in mouse
organs has been described [34]. All mouse protocols were
designed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Cell-based inhibition assays
The colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 was obtained
from ATCC and the generation of somatic knock-out
derivatives with PI3Kα wt or H1047R genotypes has been
described [8]. Cells were seeded in McCoy’s 5A medium
(Invitrogen)supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum
(FBS, HyClone, Logan, UT, USA)at a density of 4000
cells per well in 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning,
Corning, NY, USA). Once the cells had adhered to the
plates (~5 hours after seeding), J-series inhibitors were
added. All control and assay wells were adjusted to a final
DMSO concentration of 1% and incubated for 48 hours.
The media was removed and the adherent cells lysed by
incubation for 1 hour at 37oC with 100 µl 10 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.8, 0.5% Igepal (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA), 25 µg/ml Proteinase K (Invitrogen), and 0.05%
SYBR green (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
DNA was measured with a FLUOstar Galaxy 96-well
plate reader (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC, USA), and cell
numbers were approximated by DNA content.

Xenograft tumor model
Tumor xenografts were established by injecting
5x106 HCT116 cells subcutaneously into the right flanks
of female nude mice. Tumor volume was measured twice
weekly using electronic calipers and calculated as length
x width2 x 0.5. After tumors reached an average volume
of 50 mm3, animals were treated daily with drugs at 150
mg/kg via IP injection for three weeks. Tumor phosphoAkt levels were determined following harvest on the last
day of the study. Xenografts were excised, snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen and pulverized with a pestle. Homogenized
tissue was re-suspended in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology) and protein contents normalized by Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Western blots were performed as described above.

cells. 1x106 cells/well were seeded in six-well plates
and serum starved for 2 hours in McCoy’s 5A medium.
Drugs were pre-mixed with complete medium containing
10% FBS and incubated with the cells for 6 hours. Cells
