ABSTRACT
Upregulation of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC) correlates with poor
prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Previous study revealed that
(E)-N-hydroxy-3-(1-(4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6yl)acrylamide (Compound 11) is a potent and selective class I HDAC inhibitor,
exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity in various human cancer cell
lines. In current study, we demonstrated that compound 11 exhibited significant
anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activity in CRC cells. Notably, compound 11
was less potent than SAHA in inhibiting HDAC6 as evident from the lower
expression of acetyl-α-tubulin, suggesting higher selectivity for class I
HDACs. Mechanistically, compound 11 induced cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M
phase, activated both intrinsic- and extrinsic-apoptotic pathways, altered the
expression of Bcl-2 family proteins and exerted a potent inhibitory effect on
survival signals (p-Akt, p-ERK) in CRC cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that
compound 11 suppressed motility, decreased mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin
and vimentin) and increased epithelial marker (E-cadherin) through downregulation of Akt. The anti-tumor activity and underlying molecular mechanisms
of compound 11 were further confirmed using the HCT116 xenograft model
in vivo. Our findings provide evidence of the significant anti-tumor activity
of compound 11 in a preclinical model, supporting its potential as a novel
therapeutic agent for CRC.

repression of genes that normally function in growth
arrest, differentiation and apoptosis [2]. Accordingly,
pharmacological inhibitors of HDACs have been
experimentally utilized for the treatment of colorectal
cancer. Several lines of evidence have suggested that
combined treatments involving HDAC inhibitors plus
tyrosine kinase inhibitors have synergistic effects in
cancer cells [3–5]. Vorinostat (also known as SAHA;
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid), a pan-HDAC inhibitor,
is currently used in the clinic to treat cutaneous T cell
lymphoma (CTCL). In addition, a number of ongoing

of immune responses, and altered angiogenesis [1].

of class I HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3, 8) in colorectal

clinical trials have assessed the combined use of SAHA
and erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC [6].
Genesis of the metastatic phenotype, which involves
alterations of functions and structures in the epithelium,
is the major cause of death in CRC patients [7]. These
changes include dedifferentiation, loss of adhesive
constraints and increased cellular motility, important
hallmarks of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [8].
EMT is considered a pathological process that contributes
to cancer progression, particularly in relation to invasion,
metastasis and drug resistance [9]. In CRC, it has been
reported that tumor cells having undergone EMT are
represented by the presence of tumor buds at the invasive
front [10]. Proteins involved in transcriptional repression
of E-cadherin gene, such as Snail, Slug and Twist, have
been shown to contribute to invasion and metastasis in
carcinoma progression [11]. Therefore, the EMT pathway
presents a promising therapeutic target for developing new
anti-cancer agents.
Compound 11 ((E)-N-hydroxy-3-(1-(4-methoxyp­
henylsulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)acrylamide)
is a novel HDAC inhibitor with cytotoxicity in a variety
of human cancer cell lines [12]. Of note, compound 11 is
more potent than SAHA in lung cancer (A549) and CRC
(HCT116) cells. In the present study, we examined the
anti-cancer activity of compound 11 and its underlying
mechanisms in human CRC cells. Our results revealed
significant anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activity in CRC
cells, and caspase-dependent activation of both intrinsicand extrinsic-apoptotic pathways. Notably, compound 11
suppressed cell motility and reversed the mesenchymal
phenotype through downregulation of Akt. Moreover, tumor
growth in a HCT116 xenograft model was significantly
suppressed by compound 11 in vivo. These findings
collectively support the potential of compound 11 for
further development as a therapeutic agent in CRC.

activity of compound 11 in HCT116 cell nuclear extracts
was measured with the HDAC Fluorescent Activity Assay.
Compound 11 exerted greater HDAC inhibition activity
than SAHA in HCT116 cells with extrapolated IC50 value
of 9.21 ± 0.19 μM, relative to 157.73 ± 6.53 μM for SAHA
(Figure 2A). We further confirmed the epigenetic effects of
compound 11 by analyzing the acetylation of histone and
nonhistone proteins, and induction of the epigenetically
silenced gene, p21. Exposure to compound 11 and SAHA
led to upregulation of acetyl-histone H3, acetyl-α-tubulin,
and p21 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner
(Figure 2B and 2C). Notably, compound 11 was less
potent than SAHA in inhibiting HDAC6 as evident from
the lower expression of acetyl-α-tubulin, suggesting
higher selectivity for class I HDACs. Our results provide
evidence of the HDAC inhibitory activity of compound
11, which exerts anti-proliferative activity and cytotoxicity
in colorectal cancer cells.

Compound 11 induces cell cycle arrest and
caspase-dependent apoptosis
To establish the mechanism by which compound
11 suppresses cell growth, we initially examined its
effect on cell cycle progression via flow cytometry. As
shown in Figure 3A, treatment with 0.6 μM compound
11 induced G2/M-phase accumulation at 6–12 h (lane
2 and lane 5) and apoptosis (sub-G1) at 24 hours
treatment (lane 8). We noted a consistent increase in the
expression levels of general mitotic markers, such as
MPM-2, cyclin B1, and phosphorylated histone H3, in
drug-treated cells (Figure 3B). Exposure to compound
11 led to a concentration- and time-dependent cleavage
of caspase 3, 8, 9 and PARP, and induction of γH2AX
in HCT116 cells (Figure 3C and 3D). These data further
confirmed the characteristic hypodiploid peak (subG1
phase) that appeared after 24 h of treatment presented in
Figure 3A. Furthermore, compound 11-induced apoptosis
was prevented upon co-treatment with the pan-caspase
inhibitor zVAD (Figure 3E), clearly indicating activation
of caspase-dependent cell death in HCT116 cells.

Compound 11 is a novel HDAC inhibitor
with anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects in
colorectal cancer cells

Effect of compound 11 on Bcl-2 family proteins
and survival signaling pathways

We initially examined the effects of compound 11 on
proliferative activity and viability of human colon cancer
cell lines, HCT116 (p53 wild-type, Figure 1A) and HT-29
(p53 mutant, Figure 1B). Compound 11 exerted significant
anti-proliferative activity and cytotoxicity in both cell
lines, despite their differing p53 status. In a previous
study, we examined the target specificity of compound
11 using an in vitro HDAC inhibition assay. Compared
with SAHA, compound 11 was 2- to 5-fold more potent
against HDAC 1, 2, and 8, but is 8-fold less potent against
HDAC 6 [12]. In the current study, the nuclear enzyme
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Compound 11 induced activation of caspase 3, 8,
and 9 in HCT116 cells (Figure 3C and 3D). Caspase 9
and Caspase 8 are indicators of intrinsic mitochondrial
and extrinsic membrane apoptotic pathway, respectively.
In addition, Bcl-2 family proteins including anti- and proapoptotic members, regulate life or death decisions and
play important roles in intrinsic apoptotic pathways in
cells [13]. In our experiments, the levels of anti-apoptotic
proteins, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, survivin, and Bcl-XL, decreased in a
time-dependent manner following compound 11 treatment

(Figure 4A). On the other hand, the proapoptotic proteins
Bak, Bim, and cytochrome c were also increased, although
the drug had little or no effect on the expression of
proapoptotic Bax (Figure 4A). PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK are the major known pathways activated in
cancer cells [14–16]. As shown in Figure 4B, treatment
with compound 11 dramatically reduced the levels of
phospho-Akt (Ser473), and phospho-ERK (Thr202/
Tyr204) in HCT116 cells. Notably, protein expression
of total Akt was also decreased. The phenomenon was
further confirmed by compound 11-mediated suppression

motility using Boyden chamber assay and wound healing
assay. Compound 11 suppressed HCT116 cell migration
at non-cytotoxic doses (0.3 μM) to a significant extent
(Figure 5A). Consistently, data from the wound healing
assay revealed that fewer cells migrated from the wound
edge to the center space upon treatment with compound 11
(Figure 5B). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
reported to play a critical role in the invasive and metastatic
activity of colorectal cancer [10, 17]. Accordingly, we
examined the effects of compound 11 on expression
of EMT-associated markers. Compound 11 induced
downregulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin
and vimentin) and invasive marker (p-FAK), whereas the
protein level of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, was
increased (Figure 6A). Given that Akt signaling activation
is crucial for EMT in colorectal cancer cells [18, 19] and
compound 11 decreases Akt protein expression (Figure
4B), we further examined the putative link between Akt
and compound 11-mediated reduction in cell migration and
EMT. Ectopically expressed Myr-Akt induced expression of
its downstream target β-catenin and rescued the inhibitory
effects of compound 11 on EMT-associated proteins (Figure
6B). The finding was further validated by the reversal
effects on cell migration, as demonstrated with Boyden
chamber (Figure 6C) and wound-healing assays (Figure
6D). Accordingly, these data propose that compound 11
reverses mesenchymal properties and suppresses migration
through downregulation of Akt in HCT116 cells.

To further evaluate the antitumor efficacy of
compound 11 in the preclinical setting, athymic nude
mice bearing established HCT116 tumor xenografts were
treated orally with vehicle or compound 11 at 50 or 100
mg/kg body weight per day. As shown in Figure 7A,
oral administration of 50 and 100 mg/kg compound 11
significantly inhibited tumor growth by 23.5% and
51.6%, respectively. Notably, SAHA was less potent than
compound 11 with 39.3% tumor growth inhibition (TGI)
at 200 mg/kg. In addition, compound 11 was well tolerated
by tumor-bearing mice and induced no appreciable change
in body weight was observed (Figure 7B). To ascertain
whether compound 11-suppressed tumor growth via
inhibition of HDACs and induction apoptosis in vivo,
intratumoral biomarkers were assessed via Western
blot. The data showed that compound 11 increases
acetylation of histone H3 and α-tubulin as well as the
cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP (Figure 7C), consistent
with our mechanistic data in vitro. Moreover, compound
11 inhibited the expression of mesenchymal markers
(N-cadherin and vimentin) and invasive marker (p-FAK),
accompanied by the induction of the epithelial marker,
E-cadherin (Figure 7D). These results clearly demonstrate
that compound 11 induces apoptosis and reverse the
mesenchymal phenotype of HCT116 cells in vivo.

DISCUSSION

compound 11 is selective for Class I HDACs. Compared
with SAHA, compound 11 is 2- to 5-fold more potent
against HDAC 1, 2, and 8, but 8-fold less potent in
inhibition of HDAC 6 [12]. These results are consistent
with our current data that compound 11 induces lower
levels of α-tubulin acetylation than SAHA (Figure 2B and
2C). In addition, compound 11 suppressed proliferation
and viability in colorectal cancer cell lines, regardless
of the mutational status of K-Ras (Figure 1). From a
clinical viewpoint, anti-tumor activity of compound 11
in a HCT116 xenograft model was demonstrated in vivo,
with no adverse effects on body weight. Our results
indicate that compound 11 is a potent HDAC inhibitor
efficacious for CRC.
The effects of HDAC inhibitors on tumor cells
include cell cycle arrest, induction of cell death,
senescence, differentiation and autophagy [22, 23].

Colorectal cancer is the third most common
malignant neoplasm worldwide and the third highest
cause of death in men and women in the United States
[20]. Extensive evidence suggests that dysregulation
of HDACs is correlated with significant decreases in
both disease-free and overall survival in several types
of cancer, including colorectal cancer [2]. Among
the different HDAC isoforms, expression of class I
HDACs has an independent prognostic impact on
human colorectal cancer [21]. In the current study,
we have provided evidence that compound 11, a
derivative of 1-arylsulfonyl-5-(N-hydroxyacrylamide)
tetrahydroquinolines, is a novel HDAC inhibitor
applicable for the treatment of CRC. Data obtained from
a previous in vitro HDAC inhibition assay showed that

The ability to cause mitotic arrest reportedly correlates
with higher cytotoxicity of HDAC inhibitors [24]. Here,
compound 11 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest from 6 to
12 h and pronounced apoptosis after 24 h treatment in a
caspase-dependent manner (Figure 3A). The expression

levels of mitotic markers, such as MPM-2, cyclin B1,
and phosphorylated histone H3, was increased in
compound 11-treated cells (Figure 3B). Several kinases
and regulatory proteins, such as Aurora B, survivin and
RhoA GTPase, are reportedly required for successful

cytokinesis [25] Downregulation of Aurora B and
survivin proteins via the 26S proteasome pathway upon
treatment of HDAC inhibitors has also been reported
[26, 27]. Therefore, further investigation of the effects
of compound 11 on these enzymes is warranted.
We further confirmed that compound 11-induced
apoptosis occurs through intrinsic and extrinsic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathways (Figure 3C and 3D). The levels of the antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, survivin, and Bcl-XL
were decreased, whereas proapoptotic Bak, Bim, and
cytochrome c were increased in a time-dependent manner
upon compound 11 treatment (Figure 4A). Clearly,
compound 11 is able to disrupt cell cycle progression
and induce apoptosis in CRC cells.

During embryogenesis of both vertebrates and
invertebrates, epithelial cells undergo conversion to a
phenotype more amenable to migration and invasion, a
process known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). EMT is also a critical process in tumor progression
that promotes cell breaching of the basement membrane
and metastasis to distant sites [11]. Emerging evidence
demonstrates a pathological role of EMT in colorectal cancer
that promotes metastasis and resistance to neoadjuvant
therapy [28]. Therefore, EMT presents a promising
therapeutic target for CRC. Our experiments showed that
compound 11 suppresses the migration of CRC cells (Figure
5A and 5B). Compound 11 also increases the epithelial
marker E-cadherin, and decreases the mesenchymal markers
(N-cadherin and vimentin) as well as the invasive marker
(p-FAK) (Figure 6A). Furthermore, these mechanisms
may occur through downregulation of Akt by compound
11 (Figure 6B and 6C). HDAC inhibitors are reported to
regulate Akt activity directly through modulating gene
expression or indirectly through disrupting the interactions
between HDAC and protein-phosphatase 1 (PP1) [29].
Valproic acid and butyrate inhibit gene transcription of Akt
and cause caspase-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells [30].
In the current study, compound 11 induced a significant
decrease in Akt protein expression at 6 h, consistent with
the suppression of its downstream targets, pGSK3-β and
β-catenin (Figure 4B). The data also demonstrated that both
of compound 11 and SAHA decrease the protein expression
of Akt and β-catenin in a concentration-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure S1). Given the role Akt in regulating
EMT and survival pathways in cancer cells, elucidation
of the mechanism underlying compound 11-induced Akt
downregulation would be of considerable research interest.
In conclusion, compound 11 is a novel HDAC
inhibitor exerting significant anti-tumor activity in CRC
cells. Compound 11 induces cell cycle arrest, and activates
both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in a caspasedependent manner. Moreover, compound 11 alters the
expression levels of Bcl-2 family proteins and has a potent
inhibitory effect on survival signals in CRC cells. Inhibition
of cell motility and reversal of the mesenchymal phenotype
are induced through downregulation of Akt. Consistent with
in vitro findings, compound 11 significantly suppresses
tumor growth in a HCT116 xenograft model in vivo. Our
results collectively validate the activity of compound 11
as a novel HDAC inhibitor and support its potential for
further development as targeted therapy for CRC.

then expressed as the percent of migration, setting the gap
width at 0 h as 100%. Percentages of migrated cells were
determined relative to cells treated with DMSO.

In vivo HCT116 xenograft model
Eight-week-old female athymic nude mice were
group-housed under conditions of constant photoperiod
(12 h light/12 h dark at 21–23°C and 60%–85% humidity)
with ad libitum access to sterilized food and water. All
animal experiments followed ethical standards, and
protocols have been reviewed and approved by Animal
Use and Management Committee of National Taiwan
University (IACUC Approval No: 20100225). Each
mouse was inoculated s.c. with 1 × 106 HCT116 cells in
a total volume of 0.1 mL serum-free medium containing
50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences). As tumors became
established (~100 mm3), mice were randomized to four
groups (n = 8) that received the following treatments: (a)
0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose/0.1%Tween 80 vehicle,
(b) Compound 11 at 50 mg/kg/d or (c) 100 mg/kg/d, and
