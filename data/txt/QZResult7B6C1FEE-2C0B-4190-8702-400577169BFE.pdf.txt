ABSTRACT
Pharmacological targeting of BTK using ibrutinib has recently shown encouraging
clinical activity in a range of lymphoid malignancies. Recently we reported that
ibrutinib inhibits human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blast proliferation and
leukemic cell adhesion to the surrounding bone marrow stroma cells. Here we report
that in human AML ibrutinib, in addition, functions to inhibit SDF1/CXCR4-mediated
AML migration at concentrations achievable in vivo. It has previously been shown
that SDF1/CXCR4-induced migration is dependent on activation of downstream BTK
in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma. Here we show that
SDF-1 induces BTK phosphorylation and downstream MAPK signalling in primary AML
blast. Furthermore, we show that ibrutinib can inhibit SDF1-induced AKT and MAPK
activation. These results reported here provide a molecular mechanistic rationale for
clinically evaluating BTK inhibition in AML patients and suggests that in some AML
patients the blasts count may initially rise in response to ibrutinib therapy, analgous
to similar clinical observations in CLL.

INTRODUCTION

receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Tec family
and clearly has an important function in a number
of benign and malignant cells of the haematopoietic
system [3-7]. Moreover, recent phase 1, 2 and 3 studies
of the irreversible oral BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib have
demonstrated excellent clinical activity and tolerability
against a variety of B-cell malignancies including, chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma,
hairy cell leukaemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
in younger and older patients alike [8-16]. Furthermore,
it is now clear that the mechanism of action [MOA] of
ibrutinib is multifactorial in nature with a significant
component of its function in lymphoid malignancy
involving disruption of the interaction between the tumor
cell and the microenvironment that protects it. Recently
our group and others have shown that there is high BTK
phosphorylation and RNA expression in AML [17-19].
Moreover, our recent study described for the first time
that ibrutinib and BTK-targeted RNA interference reduced

Despite recent significant progress in the
understanding of the biology of AML the clinical
outcomes for the majority of patients diagnosed with AML
presently remain poor. AML is primarily a disease of the
elderly[1], and for most of the 75% of patients aged over
60 at diagnosis long term survival has barely improved in
the last 40 years [2], largely because the intensity and side
effects of existing curative therapeutic strategies (which
are commonly used to treat the younger fitter patients)
coupled to patient co-morbidities, frequently limit their
use in this older less fit population. Consequently, there
is an urgent need to identify pharmacological strategies in
AML, which are not only effective but can be tolerated by
the older, less well patient. It is envisaged that treatments
which target tumor-specific biology will help realise this
goal.

factor-induced proliferation of both AML cell lines and
primary AML blasts, as well as reducing AML blast
adhesion to BMSC [19].
Inhibition of BTK has been shown to regulate
CLL, MCL and MM cell migration by inhibiting SDF1
(stromal derived factor 1) induced CXCR4 regulated cell
trafficking [20-22]. SDF1 is an extracellular chemokine
which is abundantly produced by the bone marrow
microenvironment binds to and activates its receptor
CXCR4 which is highly expressed on many non-malignant
and malignant cells including breast cancer cell, normal
haematopoietic CD34+ cells as well as AML blasts [23,
24]. In this study we investigate the role of BTK inhibition
on the function of SDF-1/CXCR4 in AML. Furthermore,
we examine the intracellular signalling cascade down
stream of SDF1/CXCR4 activation, specifically the effects
on AKT and MAPK. Finally, we examine the role of BTK
RNAi on SDF-1/CXCR4-mediated AML migration.

normal B cells [21, 27], we examined the activity of BTK
phosphorylation and downstream AKT and MAPK in
response to SDF1 and found that SDF1 increases levels
of pBTK and downstream MAPK in primary AML blasts
(Figure 2A). Since CXCR4 activation has been shown to
mediate downstream MAPK and AKT activity [28, 29], we
examined if ibrutinib could inhibit SDF1 induced MAPK
and AKT signalling in primary AML blast. Figure 2B
shows that ibrutinib inhibits SDF1 induced BTK, MAPK
and AKT phosphorylation in AML at concentrations
equivalent to those that can be achieved in vivo (based on
ibrutinib 420 mg orally once a day) [10, 16]. These results
demonstrate that ibrutinib inhibits CXCR4 mediated
signalling in primary human AML cells.

RESULTS

Since CXCR4 is a Gi-coupled receptor and pertussis
toxin inhibits Gi-coupled receptor activation [30],
we used pertussis toxin to determine if SDF1 induces
phosphorylation of BTK through CXCR4. To do this we
treated AML cell line MV4-11 with pertussis toxin for
15 mins before the addition of SDF1 for 10mins. Figure
3A shows that pertussis toxin can inhibit SDF1 mediated
phospoBTK activation in AML blasts. Next we wanted to
determine if inhibition of CXCR4 activation by pertussis
toxin as well as inhibition of downstream AKT and MAPK
, could also block SDF1 induced migration of AML cell
line MV4-11. Figure 3B shows that pertussis toxin,
PD98059 and AKT inhibitor VIII could all inhibit SDF1
induced migration in MV4-11 cells.

Pharmacological inhibition of G proteins inhibits
SDF1 induced BTK activation

Ibrutinib inhibits AML cell migration in response
to SDF-1
Previously we have shown that ibrutinib inhibits
AML proliferation and adhesion to BMSC. In myeloma
and CLL ibrutinib inhibits CXCR4/SDF1-mediated
migration [11, 25]. Moreover, inhibition of CXCR4/SDF1
axis using AMD3100 (Plerixafor), an agonist for CXCR4,
has been shown to decrease AML tumor burden in AML
leukaemic mice in combination with conventional AML
chemotherapy [26]. Therefore we initially examined the
expression of CXCR4 in human AML cell lines and found
that 4/4 cell lines were positive for CXCR4 expression
(Figure 1A). Next we examined the effects of ibrutinib on
the migration of the AML cell lines U937, MV4-11, HL60
and THP-1 in response to SDF1. Figure 1B shows that
ibrutinib can inhibit the migration of all AML cell lines
tested. Finally, we tested the in-vitro activity of ibrutinib
on SDF-1 induced migration in a spectrum of primary
AML blasts from a wide age spectrum of adult patients
and across a range of WHO AML subclasses (Table 1).
Figure 1C shows that ibrutinib significantly inhibits
primary AML blast migration (n=12). Taken together these
data show that ibrutinib inhibits SDF1/CXCR4 driven
migration in human AML.

Knockdown of BTK inhibits SDF1 induced
migration in AML
It has been shown that ibrutinib has multiple kinase
targets including interleukin-2-inducible kinase [31],
as well as other members of the TEC kinase family.
Therefore to eliminate the problems associated with
off target inhibitor activity we evaluated migration of
AML cells lines using genetic inhibition of BTK. To do
this we generated lentivirus-mediated long-term BTK
knockdown using targeted artificial microRNA (BTKtargeted miRNA) and visualisation of infected cells by
a concurrently expressed GFP signal tag as previously
described [19]. The introduction of BTK-specific miRNA
dramatically inhibited the expression of BTK in THP-1
and HL60 (Figure 4A). Next we examined the role of
mRNA targeted BTK knockdown on THP-1 and HL60
migration. Figure 4B shows that AML cells with BTKKD had reduced SDF1 mediated migration confirming
that BTK is involved in regulating AML migration in
response to SDF1. Figure 4C shows a schematic of how
BTK targets SDF1/CXCR4 signalling in AML.

DISCUSSION

ibrutinib inhibits SDF1/CXCR4 pathway and functions
to disrupt migration signals from the microenvironment
This study further validates an emerging focus of targeting
kinases critical for the survival of malignant cells and
gives us a clearer understanding of how inhibition of BTK
may optimally be harnessed therapeutically in AML. In
summary, we provide additional scientific support for
clinical trials of ibrutinib in patients with AML.

BTK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase widely
expressed in hematopoietic cells and long known to be
critical in B cell differentiation and survival pathways.
BTK is a member of the BTK/Tec family of tyrosine
kinases [32]. BTK activation has been implicated in a
variety of hematopoietic cellular responses and there is
a growing literature supporting the role of BTK in HSC
and cells of the myeloid compartment [33-35]. Previously
we have shown that ibrutinib inhibits AML adhesion to
BMSC. In the present study we develop on these findings
to investigate the effect of BTK inhibition using ibrutinib
on AML blast migration.
In CLL and other B cell malignancies ibrutinib
inhibits SDF1/CXCR4-induced tumor cell migration
[20, 25]. We hypothesised that SDF1/CXCR4 signalling
was also regulated by BTK in AML. Inhibition of
CXCR4 signalling using the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100
(Plerixafor) can mobilise non-malignant hematopoietic
stem cells from the bone marrow in to the peripheral
blood for harvesting[36]. Moreover, in AML AMD3100
has been shown to increase the level of AML cells in the
peripheral blood and therefore increase their sensitivity to
chemotherapy in murine models [26]. Our data confirm
that ibrutinib targets SDF1/CXCR4 signalling.
Ibrutinib has been shown to be well tolerated
with limited grade 3 and 4 toxicity across a broad age
range of patients with CLL and MCL [5, 15, 16] . Since
AMD3100 inhibits SDF1-mediated non-malignant CD34+
cell migration we also expect ibrutinib to do the same,
however, as we have observed previously we expect
ibrutinib to inhibit pro-survival signals including SCF
mediated and to a lesser extent IL-3 and GM-CSF in AML
[19]. The clinical significance of the ibrutinib effect on
non-malignant HSC in patients with AML can only be
defined in the context of clinical trials.
In patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib an
initial and sometimes persistent rise in the circulating
lymphocyte count may be seen, even in the context of
clinically responding disease [8]. This is believed to occur
in part because of an egress of malignant cells from nodal
compartments[37]. In AML blocking of SDF/CXCR4 by
AMD3100 is associated with a rise in circulating tumour
cells[26]. In light of these reports and our own findings
that Ibrutinib inhibits CXCR4/SDF1 mediated migration
in AML we hypothesise that in some AML patients the
blast count may initially rise in response to ibrutinib
therapy. However while the rising lymphocyte count in
CLL causes no known harm to the patient, an uncontrolled
rise in the blast count in AML may put patients at risk
of leucostasis. Accordingly we suggest future clinical
trial protocols of BTK inhibition in human AML should
include strategies to manage a rising blast count (such as
addition of cytoreductive chemotherapy) should it occur.
Here we show for the first time that in human AML
