Abstract
Expression of cyclin E proteolytic cleavage products, low-molecular weight cyclin E (LMW-E), is associated
with poor clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer and it enhances tumorigenecity in mouse models.
Here we report that LMW-E expression in human mammary epithelial cells induces an epithelial-tomesenchymal transition phenotype, increases the CD44hi/CD24lo population, enhances mammosphere
formation, and upregulates aldehyde dehydrogenase expression and activity. We also report that breast
tumors expressing LMW-E have a higher proportion of CD44hi/CD24lo tumor cells as compared with tumors
expressing only full-length cyclin E. In order to explore how LMW-E enriches cancer stem cells in breast
tumors, we conducted a protein microarray analysis that identiﬁed the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Hbo1
as a novel cyclin E/CDK2 substrate. The LMW-E/CDK2 complex phosphorylated Hbo1 at T88 without
affecting its HAT activity. When coexpressed with LMW-E/CDK2, wild-type Hbo1 promoted enrichment of
cancer stem-like cells (CSC), whereas the T88 Hbo1 mutant reversed the CSC phenotype. Finally, doxorubicin
and salinomycin (a CSC-selective cytotoxic agent) synergized to kill cells expressing LMW-E, but not fulllength cyclin E. Collectively, our results suggest that the heightened oncogenecity of LMW-E relates to its
ability to promote CSC properties, supporting the design of therapeutic strategies to target this unique
function. Cancer Res; 73(17); 5556–68. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Before the G1–S phase boundary, cyclin E associates with
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) to further phosphorylate
and inactivate the pRb–E2F complex and promotes the Sphase entry (1–3). Cyclin E overexpression by genomic and
transcriptional ampliﬁcation has been reported in multiple
cancers, particularly in breast cancer (4–8). In addition,
posttranslational proteolytic cleavage of cyclin E mediated
by a serine protease generates two low-molecular weight
cyclin E (LMW-E) isoforms in cancer cells (9, 10). Compared
with full-length cyclin E (EL), the LMW-E isoforms are
hyperactive by forming tighter interaction with CDK2 and
are more resistant to p21 and p27 inhibition, resulting in
higher rate of proliferation (11, 12, 13). Transgenic mice
expressing LMW-E isoforms are themselves malignant as

approximately 27% of LMW-E transgenic mice develop
mammary adenocarcinomas compared with 10% of transgenic mice with EL expression (14). Furthermore, approximately 25% of the LMW-E tumors develop metastasis compared with 8% in the EL tumors (14). We recently showed
preferential accumulation of LMW-E/CDK2 complexes in
the cytoplasm (15). The altered subcellular localization of
LMW-E renders it less susceptible to Fbw7-directed proteasomal degradation. This ﬁnding implicates many possibilities that can explain the particular oncogenic characteristics
of LMW-E that are distinct from full-length cyclin E, and
that these effects could be independent from cell-cycle
regulation.
Compared with the EL isoform, overexpression of LMW-E
induces aberrant acinar morphogensis and mammary tumorigenesis in a CDK2-dependent manner (15, 16). In addition,
examination of 395 breast cancer patient tissues identiﬁed
LMW-E as an independent and powerful prognostic and
predictive marker of patient outcome (17). Finally, we recently
reported that the b-Raf-ERK1/2-mTOR pathway was activated
in LMW-E–expressing patient samples, and activation of this
pathway was associated with poor disease-speciﬁc survival
(16).
Here, we provide evidence that the tumorigenicity of LMW-E
is mediated through induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that leads to enrichment of the cancer
stem-like cells (CSC) population via the phosphorylation of
Hbo1 [HAT binding to ORC1 (origin recognition complex 1)]

Hbo1 Is a Substrate for Cyclin E and Enriches CSC

and shows that these tumor cells can be effectively targeted by
combination treatments targeting both cell proliferation (i.e.,
doxorubicin) and CSCs (i.e., salinomycin).

Materials and Methods
Detailed description of methods on bright ﬁeld and indirect
immunoﬂuorescence analysis, quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) analysis, tissue samples, immunohistochemical
staining, Western blot analysis, drug treatment, high-throughput survival assay (HTSA), histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
activity colorimetric assay, ALDEFLUOR assay, lentiviral packaging, infection of short hairpin RNAs (shRNA), scratch assay,
and sorting of CD44hi/CD24lo is provided in the Supplementary
Methods.
CD24/CD44 FACS analysis
Half a million cells were washed three times with PBS
containing 1% horse serum and resuspended with 10 mL
phycoerythrin (PE) anti-mouse CD24, 10 mL allophycocyanin
(APC) anti-mouse CD44 (BD Pharmingen), and 30 mL of the 1%
serum PBS buffer. Samples were incubated for 20 minutes on
ice, washed with 1% serum PBS buffer, and analyzed with the
FACSCalibur. The data were analyzed by the FlowJo software
(version 8.8.6; TreeStar, Inc.). Cells with only a single antibody
label were used to set up the gates for analysis.
Mammosphere formation efﬁciency
To generate primary mammospheres, cells were grown in
serum-free, growth factor–enriched media in low attachment
plates as previously described by Dontu and colleagues (18).
Brieﬂy, cells were trypsinized, and single cells seeded in 6-well
ultralow attachment plates (40,000 cells/mL) in serum-free
Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL
basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF), 20 ng/mL EGF and B27
(Invitrogen), and incubated for 5 to 7 days. For secondary
mammosphere assay, cells from primary mammospheres were
dispersed with 0.05% trypsin, seeded in 6-well ultralow attachment plates (20,000 cells/mL) in mammosphere media, and
incubated for 5 to 7 days. Mammospheres with at least a size
of 100 mm were counted with an automated colony counter
(Oxford Optronix) following MTT staining (Sigma-Aldrich)
to increase the contrast and allow automatic detection of
mammospheres.
ProtoArray human protein microarray analysis
The ProtoArray Human Protein Microarrays (Invitrogen)
contain more than 6,100 kinase substrates expressed as
N-terminus glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions (www.
invitrogen.com/protoarray). Puriﬁed FLAG-EL/CDK2 and
FLAG-LMW-E/CDK2 complexes were produced in sf9 insect
cells, puriﬁed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with FLAGtagged antibody and eluted with 3 FLAG peptide (Sigma).
Arrays were incubated either with recombinant active EL/
CDK2 or LMW-E/CDK2 at a concentration of 50 nmol/L in
the presence of 33P-g-ATP for 1 hour at 30 C. After washing
and drying, arrays were exposed to X-ray ﬁlm overnight.
Imaging and data analysis were conducted as recommended
by the manufacturer.

Statistical analysis
Each cell culture experiment was carried out at least three
times. Continuous outcomes were summarized with mean and
SDs. Comparisons among groups were conducted using SPSS
software, version 12.0 through either unpaired Student t test or
Pearson x2 test as indicated in the ﬁgure legends.

Results
LMW-E activates gene expression associated with the
EMT and enhances cell migration
The cell line system used in this report was previously
derived and described (16). Brieﬂy, to investigate the functional
tumorigenic difference between the EL and LMW-E isoforms,
we used the 76NE6 cell line [which is a human mammary
epithelial cell (hMEC) derived from reduction mammoplasty]
and exogenously introduced empty vector, EL, and LMW-E
cyclin E isoforms to generate stable cell lines (herein referred to
as 76NE6-V, 76NE6-EL, and 76NE6-LMW-E). These cells were
subjected to xenograft transplantation and in vivo passaging.
Only the 76NE6-LMW-E (but not the 76NE6-V or 76NE6-EL)
cells were tumorigenic. The tumors were removed, prepared
for culture in vitro, and then injected back into the mice for four
successive generations. As a result, the cell lines derived from in
vivo passaging of the 76NE6-LMW-E cells and used in this
article are T1G2.2, T1G3.1, and T1G4.2, in which T denotes
tumor and G generation and are herein referred to as tumorderived cells (TDC). We found that continued passaging of the
76NE6-LMW-E cells in vivo generated more aggressive tumors
with a selection for an increase in the level of LMW-E protein
and a decrease in EL protein level (16).
We initially observed that the TDCs displayed reduced cell–
cell contact. Immunostaining shows dramatically reduced Ecadherin expression in LMW-E–expressing cells (Fig. 1A and
B), particularly at the membrane junction, whereas the parental 76NE6 cells display strong membranous E-cadherin staining (Fig. 1A, white arrows).
76NE6-LMW-E and the TDCs showed high expression of
cyclin E mRNA levels, and reduced expression of E-cadherin
mRNA levels (Fig. 1C and D). Furthermore, the cells that show
high cyclin E expression also upregulate N-cadherin, twist, slug,
and vimentin mRNA levels, which are the genes associated with
the EMT (Fig. 1E–H). Taken together, exogenous LMW-E
expression in the 76NE6 cells resulted in reduced cell–cell
adhesion and induced transcriptional changes that are features of the EMT.
The passage of cells through an EMT is associated with
increased migratory and invasive properties. Previously (16),
we showed that hMECs with LMW-E expression invaded
signiﬁcantly more than cells with EL expression. Therefore,
to test if LMW-E may also contribute to the migratory phenotype of these cells, we subjected the TDCs and the parental
cells to in vitro scratch assay (Supplementary Fig. S1). The
average area closure for the 76NE6-EL cells was 28.8%  7.9% at
16 hours compared with 43.8%  6.9% (P < 0.05) for the 76NE6LMW-E and 61.7%  11.2%, 66.0%  8.7%, and 57.8%  9.0% (P
< 0.01) for the T1G2.2, T1G3.1, and T1G4.2 cells, respectively.
This result shows that LMW-E expression enhances the migratory property of mammary cells signiﬁcantly more than EL

Figure 1. LMW-E activates gene expression associated with the EMT. 76NE6 cells with stable expression for cyclin E (V, EL, and LMW-E) and three of the in vivo
passaged lines (T1G2.2, T1G3.1, and T1G4.2) were ﬁxed and immunostained with E-cadherin antibody and nuclei were counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; scale bar, 100 mm; A), and subjected to Western blot analysis with cyclin E and E-cadherin (B). C–H, cells were cultured on

expression and is consistent with the invasive (16) and EMT
properties associated with LMW-E expression.
LMW-E expression enriches the mammary CSC
population
The connection between induction of the EMT and generation of cells with CSC properties (19) led us to suspect that
the tumorigenicity of LMW-E could be due to its ability to
induce the EMT and enrich CSCs. To investigate whether
ectopic expression of EL or LMW-E can enrich this population,
cells were stained using antibodies to CD24 and CD44, and
their relative expression levels were measured by ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Fig. 2).
We found that expression of LMW-E increased the number of cells with CD44hi/CD24lo phenotype compared with
the EL expressing 76NE6 cells and to vector control cells (P <
0.05; Fig. 2A). The difference was more remarkable in the
TDCs, in which most of the clones contained approximately
60% of this CSC population. Furthermore, Western blot
analysis using CD24 and CD44 antibodies conﬁrmed that

5558

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

the LMW-E–expressing cells downregulated CD24 and upregulated CD44 protein levels (Fig. 2E). Because in vivo passaging led to the enhancement of LMW-E expression as well
as enrichment for the CD44hi/CD24lo population, we propose that cyclin E is involved in selecting for this CSC
population. Cyclin E expression levels also positively correlated with the CD44hi/CD24lo population with R2 ¼ 0.853
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 2B).
CSCs also have the increased ability to form mammospheres
(18, 20). As expected, the 76NE6-V control cells underwent
apoptosis as apparent by extensive membrane blebbing (Fig.
2C). In contrast, the 76NE6-LMW-E cells and the TDCs were
able to form more and larger mammospheres compared with
the 76NE6-EL cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 2C and D). The breast cancer
cell line Sum159, which contains a high percentage of CD44hi/
CD24lo cells and forms robust mammospheres, served as a
positive control (21). Similar to primary mammospheres, all
the LMW-E–overexpressing 76NE6 cells formed signiﬁcantly
more secondary mammospheres than EL-expressing 76NE6
cells (Fig. 2D) conﬁrming their self-renewal abilities.

using the automated GelCount program and statistical analysis used was unpaired Student t test (error bars, SEM). For secondary mammosphere
assay, cells from primary mammospheres were dispersed with 0.05% trypsin, seeded in 6-well ultralow attachment plates in mammosphere media, and
incubated for 5 days and counted as described earlier. E, lysates from cell cultured on regular tissue culture treated plates were extracted and subjected to
Western blot analysis with antibodies against cyclin E, CD24, CD44, and b-actin. In addition, lysates from mammosphere cultures were extracted and
subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against ALDH and b-actin. F, ALDELUOR assay was conducted on cells cultured on monolayer. For each
sample, 500,000 cells were incubated with the ALDH substrate alone or with the ALDH inhibitor (DEAB) and subjected to FACS analysis. The ALDH activity is
obtained by subtracting the DEAB inhibitor value and the statistical analysis used was unpaired Student t test (error bars, SEM).

To determine if the CSCs (CD44hi/CD24lo) are able to
differentiate into non-CSCs, we sorted the CSC fraction
(CD44hi/CD24lo) of each of the 76NE6 cell lines (EL, LMW-E,
T1G2.2, T1G3.1, and T1G4.2) and examined the distribution of

cell types after growth of isolated CSCs from 76NE6 cell lines
for 1 week (Supplementary Fig. S2). The results revealed that
sorted CSCs rapidly differentiate into non-SCCs after 7 days
(53% for EL, 30% for LMW-E, and 13%–43% for the TDCs). This

result shows that LMW-E–generated CSCs are also capable of
generating non-CSCs.
High aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) protein and enzymatic levels are also associated with CSC phenotypes (22). The
76NE6-LMW-E cells and the TDCs express high LMW-E and
ALDH protein levels (Fig. 2E) along with statistically higher
ALDH activity compared with the 76NE6-EL and vector control
cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 2F). Collectively, the evidence we provide in
these series of experiments suggest that LMW-E enriches cells
with CSC properties by upregulating the ALDH activity level
and enabling hMECs to survive and undergo self-renewal in the
absence of basement membrane attachment.
Hbo1 is a novel substrate of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex
To elucidate the signaling pathway downstream of LMW-E,
we used the ProtoArray Human Protein Microarray from
Invitrogen. Recombinant EL/CDK2 and LMW-E/CDK2 complexes were expressed and puriﬁed from insect cell lysates and
a kinase assay was conducted using GST-Rb as a substrate to
conﬁrm that these complexes have robust kinase activity
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Next, the Protein Microarray, which contains more than 9,000 unique human proteins
(Supplementary Fig. S3C), was subjected to kinase assay with
puriﬁed EL/CDK2 and LMW-E/CDK2 complexes. A list of
proteins that were most differentially phosphorylated by
EL/CDK2 and LMW-E/CDK2 complexes was generated (Supplementary Table S1). Our screen identiﬁed 146 substrates
common to both EL/CDK2 and LMW-E/CDK2 complexes.
Interestingly, we only identiﬁed four proteins that were phosphorylated by EL/CDK2 signiﬁcantly more than by LMW-E/
CDK2 as compared with the 14 potential substrates that were
preferentially phosphorylated by LMW-E/CDK2 (Supplementary Fig. S3D). This suggests that by losing the N-terminal
portion of cyclin E, the LMW-E/CDK2 kinase complex is able to
speciﬁcally interact and phosphorylate additional proteins.
Results obtained from 2 independent ProtoArray microarray
experiments identiﬁed Hbo1 as a novel substrate for LMW-E/
CDK2 with the phosphorylation signal being 3-fold higher than
that noted by EL/CDK2 (Fig. 3A). Hbo1 is highly conserved
from yeast to humans and has been implicated in regulating
gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA repair (23–26).
Ectopic overexpression of Hbo1 in MCF7 and SKBR3 cells
enhanced soft agar colony formation, whereas knockdown of
Hbo1 with siRNA blocked S-phase progression and reduced
cell proliferation (27, 28). Furthermore, Hbo1 is highly
expressed in breast cancer tissues and correlates positively
with histologic grade in estrogen receptor-a (ER-a)–positive
tumors (29). Therefore, we decided to further investigate its
relationship with cyclin E/CDK2 in mediating mammary
tumorigenesis.
To examine if Hbo1 is in the same complex as LMW-E/
CDK2, we coexpressed FLAG-EL or FLAG-LMW-E, HA-CDK2,
with Myc-Hbo1 into HEK293T cells. We observed binding of EL
and LMW-E as well as CDK2 with Hbo1 both using Myc and
Flag antibodies (Fig. 3B).
To conﬁrm whether Hbo1 is a substrate of the cyclin
E/CDK2 kinase complex, puriﬁed EL/CDK2 and LMW-E/CDK2
kinase complexes were used in kinase assays (Fig. 3C). Both

5560

Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013

kinase complexes phosphorylate Hbo1 at similar levels, and
addition of roscovitine (a CDK1/2 inhibitor) efﬁciently inhibited the Hbo1 phosphorylation signal (Fig. 3D). There are six
potential CDK2 phosphorylation sites on the Hbo1 gene
sequence (Fig. 3E) that were mutated to alanine to identify
which site is being phosphorylated by the LMW-E/CDK2
complex. The mutant proteins were transfected into HEK293T
cells, puriﬁed by IP, and subjected to kinase assay (Fig. 3F).
Only the T88A-mutant variant of Hbo1 showed abolished
radioactive signal, suggesting that of the six potential phosphorylation sites, the LMW-E/CDK2 complex is phosphorylating Hbo1 only at the T88 residue (Fig. 3G). Collectively, these
results identify Hbo1 as a novel substrate of the LMW-E/CDK2
complex that may mediate critical downstream signaling to
contribute to the ability of LMW-E/CDK2 to enrich a CSC
phenotype.
Cyclin E/CDK2 phosphorylation of Hbo1 does not affect
the HAT activity of Hbo1
CDK1 phosphorylates Hbo1 at T85/T88 to create a docking
site for polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1; ref. 30), which subsequently
activates the HAT enzymatic activity of Hbo1. We speculated
that the interaction and phosphorylation of Hbo1 by the cyclin
E/CDK2 complex may also affect the HAT activity of Hbo1. To
test this hypothesis, we puriﬁed the following proteins from
HEK293T cells overexpressing Myc-Hbo1 (wt, T88A, and
T88D), streptavidin-ﬂag-S protein (SFB)-tagged EL, SFBLMW-E, and SFB-CDK2 by IP with Myc or FLAG antibodies
and subjected to an in vitro HAT activity colorimetric assay
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S4C, phosphorylation of Hbo1 at T88 did not alter the HAT
activity of Hbo1 as the T88A and T88D mutants exhibited
similar HAT activity levels to wild-type (wt) Hbo1. Furthermore, inhibition of the kinase activity of EL/CDK2 and LMWE/CDK2 by addition of roscovitine did not affect the HAT
activity level. These results suggest that the HAT activity of
Hbo1 is unlikely to modulate the LMW-E–mediated CSC
phenotype.
Hbo1 is overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and
when coexpressed with LMW-E/CDK2, enhances selfrenewal capability of hMECs
We next set out to directly decipher if Hbo1 has a role in
inducing the CSC properties of the LMW-E–expressing cells.
We ﬁrst determined that Hbo1 is highly expressed in 13 of 18
breast cancer cell lines tested with no breast cancer subtype
speciﬁcity compared with the relatively low levels in the three
hMEC lines (Fig. 4A). The 76NE6-LMW-E, T1G2.2, T1G3.1, and
T1G4.2 cells also express high levels of Hbo1 protein compared
with the 76NE6-V and 76NE6-EL cells (Fig. 4B). To determine
whether coexpression of cyclin E (EL or LMW-E), CDK2, and
Hbo1 in the 76NE6 cells affect the CSC population, these gene
constructs were introduced into the 76NE6 cells via lentiviral
infection and stable cell lines were generated through antibiotic selection (Fig. 4C). The 76NE6 cells coexpressing wt Hbo1
with the LMW-E/CDK2 complex (Fig. 4C, lane 8) formed
signiﬁcantly more mammospheres than those with the EL/
CDK2 complex (Fig. 4C, lane 7; P ¼ 0.0027).

Figure 3. Hbo1 is a novel substrate of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex. A, the ProtoArray microarray experiment was carried out in 2 independent experiments.
The phosphorylation signals indicate relative radioactive signal detected in the microarray spots. B, FLAG-EL or LMW-E, HA-CDK2, and Myc-Hbo1
constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells and IP with either Myc- or FLAG-tagged antibodies and probed with the indicated antibodies. IB, immunoblot.
C, SFB-EL or SFB-LMW-E was cotransfected with SFB-CDK2 into HEK293T cells, puriﬁed using FLAG-tagged antibody, eluted with 3X FLAG peptide, and
visualized by Western blot analysis. Myc-Hbo1 was transfected into HEK293T cells and puriﬁed using Myc-tagged antibody. D, the EL/CDK2 or LMW-E/CDK2
32
kinase complex was incubated with puriﬁed Hbo1 in the presence of P-g-ATP, with or without roscovitine. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE
and exposed to X-ray ﬁlms. E, schematic of the Hbo1 gene construct with the potential phosphorylation sites predicted on the basis of the CDK2
consensus phosphorylation motif (S/T-P-X-R/K/H). F and G, the six potential phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine, expressed, puriﬁed, and
subjected to similar kinase assay as in D. IB, immunoblot.

The data in Fig. 4C further strengthen our observation in Fig.
4A and B, which is that breast cancer cell lines express high
levels of Hbo1 proteins and that the 76NE6-LMW-E, and the
TDCs T1G2.2, T1G3.1, and T1G4.2 cells also express high level
of Hbo1 protein compared with the 76NE6-V and 76NE6-EL
cells. The parental 76NE6 cell line expresses very low level of
Hbo1 and thus explains why retroviral induction of EL/CDK2
or LMW-E/CDK2 does not result in a difference in the ability of
these cells to form mammospheres (Fig. 4C, lanes 5 and 6).
However, when Hbo1 is concomitantly overexpressed, we
observed a signiﬁcant difference in the number of mammospheres formed between EL- and LMW-E–expressing cells,
indicating that LMW-E/CDK2 coexpression with Hbo1
enhances self-renewal capability of hMECs to a higher extent
that with EL/CDK2 (Fig. 4C, compare lane 7 with lane 8).

Perhaps during tumor evolution, Hbo1 upregulation is selected
for tumor growth advantage as we observe that most of the
breast cancer cell lines that we examined express very high
level of Hbo1 protein in Fig. 4A.
In addition, coexpression of the T88A Hbo1 mutant in the
76NE6 cells (Fig. 4C, lanes 9 and 10) reduced the number of
mammospheres to similar levels as in the cells without Hbo1
overexpression (Fig. 4C, lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that the
phosphorylation of Hbo1 by the cyclin E/CDK2 complex is
critical for the enhanced self-renewal capability of these cells.
Furthermore, the cells with the T88D Hbo1 phosphorylation
mimetic expression (Fig. 4C, lanes 11 and 12) showed increase
in mammosphere formation compared with T88A Hbo1 (Fig.
4C, lanes 9 and 10) underscoring the importance of the
phosphorylation of Hbo1 at T88 by the cyclin E/CDK2 complex

Hbo1 Is a Substrate for Cyclin E and Enriches CSC

to generate a docking site for protein recruitment. Collectively,
these results indicate that Hbo1 along with LMW-E/CDK2
function to alter the physiology of the cell to generate cell
properties associated with CSCs.
Next, we interrogated the role of Hbo1 in enriching the CSC
population. For these studies, shRNAs targeting the Hbo1
mRNA were packaged into lentivirus with HEK293T cells and
used to infect the 76NE6-V, EL, LMW-E, T1G2.2, T1G4.2, and
Sum159 cells. Approximately 98% of the cells expressed high
levels of GFP, suggesting that the shRNAs were integrated
successfully (Fig. 4D). Western blot analysis indicated that
while the shHbo1-4 construct moderately downregulates
Hbo1, the shHbo1-5 construct is much more effective at
knocking down Hbo1 expression (more than 60%; Fig. 4E).
Knockdown of Hbo1 signiﬁcantly reduced the CD44hi/CD24lo
population as well as the ability of the cells to form mammosphere structures compared with the shControl cells (Fig. 4F
and G). Furthermore, reexpression of an shHbo1–5–resistant
construct (shHbo1–5R; Fig. 4E) rescued the reduced CD44hi/
CD24lo population as well as the number of mammospheres
formed (Fig. 4F and G). Collectively, our ﬁndings suggest that
the presence of Hbo1 in LMW-E–expressing cells enhanced the
properties associated with CSCs, which can be reduced by
knockdown of Hbo1 expression.
To determine whether Hbo1 indeed functions downstream
of LMW-E/CDK2 to induce the EMT phenotypes, we measured
the mRNA levels [relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and relative to the level seen in cells
infected with the scrambled shRNA, shEmpty] of the T1G4.2
cells for the expression of Hbo1, cyclin E, and the EMT marker
genes E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, twist, and slug by RTPCR. We show that knockdown of Hbo1 in T1G4.2 cells leads to
a reduction in Hbo1 and cyclin E levels concomitant with a
reduction in vimentin, twist, and slug mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition, reintroduction of the shHbo1–5–
resistant construct seems to be able to rescue the expression
levels of these genes. This is consistent with Hbo1 and cyclin E
expression being required for some of the EMT gene markers
expression.
Cytoplasmic cyclin E expression correlates with high
CD44hi/CD24lo population in breast cancer patient tissue
Given that cyclin E expression positively associates with the
CD44hi/CD24lo population in hMECs, we aimed to determine
whether this correlation also exists in tumor tissue samples
from patients with breast cancer. Breast cancer patient tissues
(n ¼ 118) were analyzed for CD24 and CD44 expression by
double IHC staining and visualized by 3,30 -diaminobenzidine
(DAB) and permanent red, respectively (Fig. 5A). The clinicopathogic characteristics of the patient cohort are presented in
Supplementary Table S2. The slides were given a score of 0 to 5

that correspond to increasing percentage of CD44hi/CD24lo
(Fig. 5A). In addition, duplicate slides from the same patient
cohort were subjected to IHC staining using a cyclin E antibody
and a scoring system as deﬁned in Fig. 5B. Finally, lysates
prepared from these patient samples were also analyzed for the
protein levels of EL and LMW-E by Western blot analysis
followed by densitometric analysis (Fig. 5C). Statistical analysis
was applied to data obtained from (i) CD24/CD44 double IHC
staining, (ii) cyclin E IHC staining, and (iii) EL versus LMW-E
protein levels from Western blot analysis.
Statistical analysis revealed that more than 60% of the
patient tissues contain less than 10% of the CD44hi/CD24lo
population (i.e., tumors that received a score of 0 or 1; n ¼ 72),
and this patient distribution was similar to that previously
reported (Table 1; ref. 31). In Fig. 5D, we show that cytoplasmic
staining of cyclin E signiﬁcantly correlated with high percentage of the CD44hi/CD24lo population (P ¼ 0.0435, unpaired
Student t test; Fig. 5D). In addition, high LMW-E expression
levels as measured by Western blot analysis signiﬁcantly
associated with cytoplasmic cyclin E staining (P ¼ 0.0194,
Pearson x2 test; Fig. 5G), whereas EL (Fig. 5F) and total cyclin E
(Fig. 5E) expression levels did not. In other words, the cytoplasmic cyclin E staining observed from IHC analysis is likely to
represent LMW-E cyclin E and not of full-length cyclin E
consistent with our previous report showing that LMW-E
preferentially accumulates in the cytoplasm in complex with
CDK2 and associated kinase activity (32). Interestingly, the
altered subcellular localization of the LMW-E isoform renders
it less susceptible to proteasomal degradation by Fbw7. As a
result, we believe that the cytoplasmic localization of LMW-E
further enhances the stability of the LMW-E/CDK2 complex
compared with the EL/CDK2 complex. The results found here
further support this observation (32). In conclusion, similar to
our cell line data, tumor tissue from patients with breast cancer
who have high CD44hi/CD24lo population signiﬁcantly correlate with cytoplasmic cyclin E, and we have shown that
cytoplasmic cyclin E protein represents the LMW isoforms.
Doxorubicin synergizes with salinomycin to kill LMW-E–
expressing tumor cells
Salinomycin was recently identiﬁed from a large screen of
small-molecule inhibitors to speciﬁcally kill CSCs (33). Breast
cancer cells treated with salinomycin showed a decrease in the
CD44hi/CD24lo population and reduction in their ability to
form mammospheres, and the 4T1 xenograft tumors formed
fewer metastases compared with parallel paclitaxel treatment
(33). Indeed, we showed that salinomycin treatment reduced
the CD44hi/CD24lo population of the LMW-E–expressing cells
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig.
S6). The TDCs contain approximately 80% of the CD44hi/
CD24lo population, in which only 10% of these cells remained

(wt, T88A, or T88D) constructs were used to infect the 76NE6 cells and then subjected to mammosphere culture. The results were averaged from at
least 2 independent experiments and the statistical analysis used was unpaired Student t test (error bars, SEM). D–G, shControl, shHbo1-4, and shHbo1-5
lentiviruses were produced in HEK293T cells and used to infect the 76NE6 stable cell panel, two of the TDCs, and Sum159 cells and subjected to
GFP FACS analysis (D), Western blot analysis (E), CD44/CD24 FACS analysis (F), and mammosphere formation assay (G). These cells were then infected with
lentivirus carrying the shHbo1-5R construct followed by the same analyses. The FACS and mammosphere formation results were averaged from at least
2 independent experiments and the statistical analysis used was unpaired Student t test ( , P < 0.05; error bars, SEM).

Figure 5. Cytoplasmic cyclin E expression correlates with high CD44 /CD24 score in breast cancer patient tissue. A, a total of 118 breast cancer patient tissue
slides were subjected to IHC double staining with CD24 and CD44 antibodies and scored for %CD44hi/CD24lo. The slides were given a score of 0 to
5 that correspond to increasing percentage of CD44hi/CD24lo population as follows: 0 (0%), 1 (1%–10%), 2 (11%–25%), 3 (26%–50%), 4 (51%–75%), and 5
(76%–100%). B, IHC single staining using cyclin E antibody and scored with respect to intensity as well as cytoplasmic versus nuclear localization.
Breast tumors were considered negative when no staining was detected either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm (score ¼ 1). Among the cases evaluated as
cyclin E–positive, if the score assigned to the nucleus exceeded the score assigned to the cytoplasm, cyclin E expression was considered predominantly
nuclear (score ¼ 2). When the nucleus and the cytoplasm received equal scores, cyclin E expression was considered both nuclear and cytoplasmic (score ¼ 3).
If cytoplasmic staining was graded higher than nuclear staining, cyclin E expression was considered predominantly cytoplasmic (score ¼ 4). The slides were
scored blindly by 2 independent investigators. Cyclin E staining is considered "nuclear" when the score is 1 and 2 and "cytoplasmic" when the score is 3 and 4.
C, cyclin E EL and LMW-E protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis from breast cancer patient tissues and quantiﬁed by densitometry.
Representative samples illustrate the IHC staining that reﬂect the scoring assigned and the LMW-E protein levels by densitometry. D, patient tissues
were subjected to IHC analysis using CD24, CD44, and cyclin E antibodies. The CD44hi/CD24lo scores in A were correlated to the nuclear versus cytoplasmic
cyclin E staining scores in B. The statistical analysis used was unpaired Student t test (error bars, SEM). The cyclin E nuclear and cytoplasmic staining
scores were correlated with total cyclin E (E), EL (F), and LMW-E (G) protein levels from densitometry of Western blot analysis. The statistical analysis
used was Pearson x2 test.

after treatment with 8 mmol/L salinomycin. We show that
salinomycin treatment results in the enrichment of the cell
population with non-CSC (CD44hi/CD24hi) cells that are not
killed by salinomycin. In addition, salinomycin treatment
effectively disrupted their ability to form mammospheres (Fig.
6B). This observation led us to hypothesize that cotreatment
with doxorubicin, which is expected to target the non-CSC
population and thereby will lead to eradication of the whole
tumor cell population.
Most highly proliferative cancer cells are sensitive to conventional chemotherapy drugs, whereas CSCs are believed to
be more resistant to these agents, resulting in high frequency of
tumor recurrence (34). As anticipated, doxorubicin treatment
with increasing drug concentration did not affect the distribution of the CD44hi/CD24lo population of any of the cell lines
examined (Fig. 6C). Therefore, a combination treatment reg-

imen was used in which the LMW-E tumor cells were ﬁrst
treated with doxorubicin to eliminate the non-CSC population
and then followed by salinomycin to target the CSC population.
An advantage of combining drug treatment is that it often
allows for administration of the drugs at lower concentrations
and therefore lessens the toxic side effects if the drugs are
synergistic. We used the HTSA to examine the toxicity
of combining doxorubicin and salinomycin (Supplementary
Fig. S3).
Using the CalcuSyn software, the isobolograms of the
76NE6-V and 76NE6-EL cells indicated that the combined
drug treatment resulted in additive to antagonistic effects (Fig.
6D and E). In contrast, the drug treatment showed a synergistic
effect in the LMW-E–expressing cells (76NE6-LMW-E, T1G2.2,
T1G3.1, and T1G4.2) and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells,
which express endogenous LMW-E isoforms. An average of the

combination indices conﬁrmed that the doxorubicin and
salinomycin combination resulted in additive/antagonistic
effects in the 76NE6-V and 76NE6-EL cells but synergistic
effects in the 76NE6-LMW-E and the TDCs (Fig. 6F). These
results suggest a promising therapeutic strategy of combining
doxorubicin and salinomycin to selectively treat patients with
breast cancer who have high levels of LMW-E expression and
enriched CSC population.

Discussion
The role of LMW-E in breast cancer was strongly established by its association with poor clinical outcome and was
subsequently reinforced by the demonstration that transgenic mice with ectopic LMW-E expression develop mammary carcinoma and metastasis at signiﬁcantly higher frequency compared with transgenic mice with EL expression
(15, 17). We recently described similar ﬁndings in a xenograft
mouse model in which hMECs expressing LMW-E/CDK2
yielded higher tumor incidence compared with cells with
EL/CDK2 expression (16).
By expressing LMW-E, the 76NE6 mammary epithelial cells
underwent a morphologic switch by adopting mesenchymal
characteristics as well as CSC properties (16). Here, we elucidate the mechanism that provides LMW-E–expressing cells
increased tumorigenic potential. LMW-E–expressing cells contain a high percentage of cells in the CD44hi/CD24lo population,
were able to form mammospheres in nonadherent culture,
and had upregulated expression and enzymatic activity of
ALDH. More importantly, the phenotypes observed were more
robust with exogenous LMW-E overexpression than with EL
overexpression.
Furthermore, we observed a strong positive association
between LMW-E expression in breast cancer tissues from
patients with tumors that contain high CD44hi/CD24lo population, suggesting that breast cancer cells with LMW-E expression have CSC-like characteristics. More importantly, statistical analysis also revealed a signiﬁcant association between

www.aacrjournals.org

LMW-E expression and cytoplasmic localization from IHC
staining of the tumor tissues, which is a more efﬁcient way
to identify LMW-E expression in tumor tissues by IHC rather
than by Western blot analysis.
We have previously reported that overexpression of the
LMW-E protein in mammary epithelial cells results in an
increase in the expression of full-length cyclin E (EL; ref. 16).
This phenomenon was observed in both cell line and transgenic mouse model systems with inducible LMW-E expression.
Perhaps during tumor progression, LMW-E induces an
unchecked G1–S phase progression, thus resulting in a positive
feedback loop that drives increased cyclin E transcription. As a
result, EL overexpression further contributes to the tumorigenic phenotypes. In all of our functional assays, we observed
that overexpression of EL resulted in a mild induction in the
phenotypes compared with those from overexpression of
LMW-E (50%). However, LMW-E/CDK2 is a stronger and
more stable kinase complex compared with the EL/CDK2
complex (32) and given that approximately 30% of patients
with breast cancer express high levels of LMW-E, their tumor
induction and progression may be due to an enhanced CSC
population.
Our screen for novel substrates of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex identiﬁed Hbo1, which is a HAT that can alter the
expression pattern of multiple genes. The consensus phosphorylation motif for CDK2 is S/T-P-X-R/K/H, and we found
that cyclin E/CDK2 phosphorylated Hbo1 at T88PKK conﬁrming that the phosphorylation is speciﬁc. T88 is located within
the N-terminal serine-rich region of the Hbo1 gene, which is the
regulatory domain, whereas the C-terminal region contains the
Zn-ﬁnger and a HAT domain that carries out the enzymatic
function (26, 35). The results from our in vitro kinase assay
showed similar phosphorylation levels of Hbo1 by both the EL/
CDK2 and LMW-E/CDK2 kinase complexes. The reason no
difference in the extent of Hbo1 phosphorylation between the
EL/CDK2 and LMW-E/CDK2 complexes is detected is due to
the saturated concentrations of the kinase as well as the
substrate in this in vitro kinase assay condition compared with
the condition conducted for the ProtoArray. The kinase concentration was 50 nmol/L in the microarray experiment and
was approximately 500 nmol/L in this in vitro kinase assay. In
addition, as the LMW-E isoforms are overexpressed in breast
cancer, we speculate that it is these truncated forms of cyclin E
in complex with CDK2 that phosphorylate Hbo1 and not the
full-length cyclin E form.
The fact that coexpression of Hbo1 with LMW-E/CDK2
further increased the CSC properties of hMECs, whereas
knockdown of Hbo1 expression reduced the CD44hi/CD24lo
population and mammosphere formation ability suggests
that Hbo1 plays a role downstream of LMW-E in enriching
the CSC population. We speculate that in the cellular
context, phosphorylation of Hbo1 by the LMW-E/CDK2
complex at T88 may also create a docking site for speciﬁc
kinases/proteins to be recruited to regulate Hbo1's HAT
activity.
Given that the understanding of breast CSCs has only
recently evolved, clinical therapy aimed at targeting these cells
is currently under active investigation. In a large screen for

Figure 6. Doxorubicin synergizes with salinomycin to kill LMW-E–expressing tumor cells. A, cells were seeded on monolayer for 24 hours and treated
with salinomycin for 4 days with the drug-containing media replaced every 48 hours. After 3 days of recovery in drug-free medium, the cells were
trypsinized and stained for PE-CD24 and APC-CD44 antibodies and analyzed by FACS analysis (error bars, SEM). B, cells were seeded on ultralow
attachment plates on day 0 and then treated with salinomycin on days 1 and 3. On day 7, MTT solution was added to the mammosphere cultures and
incubated at 37 C for 1 hour. Number of mammospheres were quantiﬁed using the automated GelCount program (error bars, SEM). C, cells were seeded on
monolayer for 24 hours and treated with doxorubicin and analyzed by FACS as in A (error bars, SEM). D, an isobologram illustrates the effects of
the combined drugs calculated from the CalcuSyn software. The combination indices calculated that lay above the line of additivity represent antagonistic,
on the line are additive, and underneath the line are synergistic effect. E, the results obtained from A were subjected to calculation using the CalcuSyn
software. The isobolograms shown are representative from 3 independent experiments. F, the combination indices were averaged from 3 independent
experiments and the statistical analysis used was unpaired Student t test (error bars, SEM).

small-molecule inhibitors that can speciﬁcally kill CSCs, Gupta
and colleagues identiﬁed salinomycin as a potent agent that
can abrogate the phenotypes associated with CSCs and thereby
reduce tumor aggressiveness and regrowth (33). Recently,
salinomycin was reported to sensitize cancer cells to doxorubicin and etoposide, leading to increased DNA damage and
apoptosis (36). In our study, we also showed that the combination of doxorubicin and salinomycin effectively targeted
both the tumor bulk (non-CSCs) and the CSCs. (37, 38). Such
synergistic effect on cancer cell toxicity further encourages
investigation into other drug combinations that target both the
CSC and non-CSC populations, which could be used in the
clinic. Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of Hbo1 as a downstream substrate of the LMW-E/CDK2 complex provides a

novel mechanism of how LMW-E mediates mammary
tumorigenesis.
The level of Hbo1 phosphorylation can also be analyzed
for association with the percentage of the CD44hi/CD24lo
population as well as survival outcome in patients. For
instance, a combination between a CDK inhibitor (i.e.,
roscovitine) and salinomycin might be effective at inhibiting
the CSC population in patients with high LMW-E expression.
Although CDK inhibitors such as ﬂavopiridol and roscovitine have shown unimpressive response in clinical trials as a
single agent, it must be noted that the patients in these trials
were not selected on the basis of LMW-E levels (20, 39). By
inhibiting the CSC population in the high LMW-E–expressing tumors, we may be able to achieve favorable outcome
