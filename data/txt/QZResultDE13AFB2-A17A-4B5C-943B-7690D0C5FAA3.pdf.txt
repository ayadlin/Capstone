Abstract
Despite an excellent initial response to first-line hormonal
treatment, most patients with metastatic prostate cancer
will succumb to a hormone-refractory form of the disease.
Because these tumors are still dependent on a functional
androgen receptor (AR), there is a need to find novel and more
potent antiandrogens. While searching for small molecules
that bind to the AR and inhibit its transcriptional activity,
BMS-641988 was discovered. This novel antiandrogen showed
an increased (>1 log) potency compared with the standard
antiandrogen, bicalutamide, in both binding affinity to the AR
and inhibition of AR-mediated transactivation in cell-based
reporter assays. In mature rats, BMS-641988 strongly inhibited androgen-dependent growth of the ventral prostate and
seminal vesicles. In the CWR-22-BMSLD1 human prostate cancer xenograft model, BMS-641988 showed increased efficacy
over bicalutamide (average percent tumor growth inhibition
>90% versus <50%), even at exposure levels of bicalutamide
3-fold greater than what can be attained in humans. Furthermore, BMS-641988 was efficacious in CWR-22-BMSLD1
tumors initially refractory to treatment with bicalutamide.
BMS-641988 was highly efficacious in the LuCaP 23.1 human
prostate xenograft model, inducing stasis throughout the
f30-day dosing. To explore the functional mechanisms of
BMS-641988, gene expression profiling analysis was done
on CWR-22-BMSLD1 xenograft models in mice. Treatment
with BMS-641988 resulted in a global gene expression profile
more similar to castration compared with that of bicalutamide. Overall, these data highlight that the unique preclinical
profile of BMS-641988 may provide additional understanding for the hormonal treatment of prostate cancer. [Cancer Res

factor member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (2, 3),
plays an important role in both the etiology and the progression
of prostate carcinoma. The binding of its specific steroid hormones, testosterone and the more potent dihydrotestosterone
(DHT), to the ligand-binding domain of the AR, promotes its
disassociation from heat shock proteins and related chaperones,
allowing its dimerization, phosphorylation, and subsequent
translocation into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, the AR
binds to the androgen response elements present in the regulatory
regions of a variety of genes, many of which are involved in the
growth, survival, and differentiation of prostate cells (4). Complete
androgen blockade was pursued in the clinic by the use of
antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide (AstraZeneca), flutamide
(Schering Plough), or nilutamide (Sanofi-Aventis), in combination
with chemical castration achieved by the use of luteinizing
hormone–releasing hormone agonists, such as leuprolide acetate
(Takeda). Despite an impressive initial response, in most cases, the
tumors will progress through treatment to a hormone-refractory
prostate cancer (HRPC) or castration-resistant prostate cancer
stage in an average of 18 months (5). The first designation is a
misnomer, because these tumors are by no means AR-independent,
as shown by a significant body of evidence recently accumulated;
there is a clear dependence on AR signaling, even in the most advanced HRPC. Analysis of tumor samples from patients with HRPC
has revealed several mechanisms used by tumor cells to reactivate the AR signaling at subphysiologic serum concentration of
androgens or even in the presence of AR antagonists. These
mechanisms include (a) gene amplification and increased expression of the AR protein (6); (b) selection of point mutations in the
AR ligand binding that can result in activation by nonandrogenic
ligands (7), or mutations in other regions, such as the amino terminus (8) or the DNA-binding domain that confer oncogenic
properties to the AR (9); (c) expression of alternatively spliced
variants of the AR that lack the ligand-binding domain and are
constitutive active (10–12); the mRNA of two of the most abundant
isoforms, AR-V1 and AR-V7, showed an average 20-fold higher
expression in HRPC specimens (n = 25) when compared with
hormone-naive prostate cancer (n = 82; P < 0.0001; ref. 11); (d)
changes in the expression ratios between AR, coactivators, and
corepressors (13–15); (e) changes in the expression of enzymes
involved in steroidogenesis (16); and ( f ) changes in signal transduction pathways (epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth
factor, interleukin-6, Wnt signaling, Stat5a/b, Ras/Raf/mitogenactivated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, etc.)
that promote post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation) of the AR and potentiate its activity under androgen-depleted
conditions (17–21). Consistent with these observations, recent data
have shown that many patients will respond to a second round of

hormone therapy, confirming the critical role of the AR in HRPC
and suggesting that targeting the AR with novel agents could have
additional clinical benefits.
In this report, the preclinical characterization of BMS-641988, a
new-generation small-molecule inhibitor of androgen signaling,
is described. Our data show that BMS-641988 is a potent antiandrogen both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, gene expression
analysis indicates that BMS-641988 functions more similar to castration than does bicalutamide.

Materials and Methods
AR binding assay. A cell-based radioligand AR-competitive binding
assay was performed using the human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB453 cells as reported previously (22). For the saturation analysis, medium
containing [3H]DHT (0.1-16 nmol/L) without (total binding) or with
(nonspecific binding) 500-fold molar excess unlabeled DHT was used.
Specific binding was evaluated by Scatchard analysis; the K d for [3H]DHT
was 0.4 nmol/L. For the competition studies, medium containing 2 nmol/L
[3H]DHT and test compounds (two replicates/sample) in concentrations
ranging from 1010 to 105 nmol/L was used. K i was determined by using
the Cheng-Prusoff equation.
Cell-based AR-dependent transactivation assay. The human breast
MDA-MB-453 (expressing wild-type AR) and prostate LNCaP (American
Type Culture Collection) or 22rv1 (ref. 23; American Type Culture
Collection; both expressing mutant endogenous AR; refs. 12, 24) cell lines
were used. Transient transfections by electroporation were optimized
accordingly (25) with either pSEAP2/PSA540/Enhancer or pGL3/PSA540/
Enhancer luciferase reporter plasmid. The secreted alkaline phosphatase
reporter plasmid is composed of the human prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) promoter (position 5284-5831; accession no. U37672; ref. 26) and
a PSA upstream enhancer containing additional androgen response
elements (position 503-1952), which were generated by PCR and subcloned
into the BglII/HindIII and XhoI/HindIII sites of pSEAP2/basic (Clontech),
respectively. The firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (PSA-Luc) was
constructed in a similar manner, using the pGL3 vector (Promega).
Cells were collected in medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal
bovine serum. LNCaP and MDA-MB-453 cells were distributed into cuvettes
and electroporated with 8 Ag reporter construct using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser
at 210 V and 960 AF. 22rv1 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen), 50 ng of the reporter plasmid, and 25 ng of a Renilla luciferase
control plasmid (Promega). Cells were assayed in the absence (blank) or
presence (control) of 1 nmol/L DHT (Sigma) and BMS-641988 or bicalutamide
(1010105 mol/L). After 24 or 48 h, supernatants from duplicate samples
were assayed individually for secreted alkaline phosphatase or luciferase activity using the Phospha-Light Chemiluminescent Reporter Gene Assay System
(Tropix) or the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega), respectively.
Proliferation assays. Cell proliferation was determined by using the
CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega),
by [3H]thymidine incorporation, and by direct cell counting. IC50 was
defined as the concentration that inhibited 50% of cellular growth.
Animal studies. All animal studies were done according to the USPHS
Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in an American
Association for Laboratory Animal Care–approved site.
Mature rat prostate weight model. Matched sets of Harlan-SpragueDawley rats (40-42 days old, 180-220 g) were treated orally by gavage (p.o.)
once a day for 14 days with the test compounds in dissolved/suspensions of
80% PEG-400 and 20% Tween 20. Intact and castrated animals ( five per
cohort) were dosed at 0.5 mL vehicle/100 g body weight. Two additional
groups of intact animals were dosed with BMS-641988 or bicalutamide
(AstraZeneca). Animals were sacrificed and the ventral prostate, seminal
vesicles, and liver were removed surgically and weighed. Immediately after
euthanasia, serum was collected and promptly frozen (80jC). Serum rat
luteinizing hormone was quantified using the rLH-[125I] Biotrak assay
(Amersham). Total testosterone was quantified using Coat-A-Count
(Diagnostic Products; PITKTT-3).

Immunohistochemistry. Tissue specimens were prepared by standard
techniques. Staining optimization was automated in a BioGenex i6000. For
antigen retrieval, Citra Plus (BioGenex) was used at 95jC for 15 min.
Cellular proliferation was determined with primary rabbit monoclonal
antibody Ki-67 at 1:100 dilution (Thermo Scientific). For detection, an
EnVision kit (DAKO) was used. Slides were then scanned with the Aperio
Scanning System and analyzed using the nuclear quantification algorithm.
Efficacy studies in s.c. human prostate cancer xenograft models.
Male immunodeficient mice [BALB/c athymic (nu/nu); Harlan; 8-10 weeks
old] were used. CWR-22-BMSLD1 and LuCaP 23.1 human xenografts were
implanted s.c. Compounds were prepared in 80% PEG-400 and 20% Tween80 and administered orally by gavage needle. Treatments were initiated
when tumors reached a median size between 75 and 200 mm3. Each
treatment regimen was tested in cohorts of eight mice. Tumors were
measured weekly for LuCaP 23.1 and twice-weekly for CWR-22-BMSLD1.
Tumor size (mm3) was calculated as (length  width2) / 2. Efficacy was
defined as z50% median tumor growth inhibition (%TGI) for longer than
one tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) compared with controls. Efficacy
was determined by time to tumor progression to target size (T-C), where the
time (days) for the median tumor size of control (C) mice to reach target
size was subtracted from that of treated (T) mice. A delay of more than one
TVDT in reaching target size was considered an active result.
To determine whether BMS-641988 could exhibit antitumor activity in
tumors that failed bicalutamide treatment, animals bearing CWR-22BMSLD1 tumors (median tumor size of 80 mm3) were treated daily, starting
at day 21 post-implant with bicalutamide (150 mg/kg). Once the median
tumor size of the group tripled, animals were randomized into two groups:
one continued receiving bicalutamide (150 mg/kg) and the other group
switched to BMS-641988 (90 mg/kg). BMS-641988 was also evaluated as a
single agent at 90 mg/kg.
PSA determination. Mouse blood samples were collected from the
retro-orbital plexus and serum PSA levels were determined weekly in
duplicate 5 AL samples using an EIA kit (Sierra).
Gene expression analysis of CWR-22-BMSLD1 tumors. CWR-22BMSLD1 human prostate tumors were implanted into nude mice at an
average volume of 150 mm3 and treated with vehicle (p.o.; 80% PEG-400 and
20% Tween 20), BMS-641988 (p.o.; 90 mg/kg), castration, or bicalutamide
(p.o.; 150 mg/kg). RNA samples were isolated (one tumor per animal, three
mice per group per time point) at 1, 2, and 7 days. Tumors were profiled on
Affymetrix U133A DNA microarray chips, containing sequences of f22,000
different genes (36 microarrays). The resulting microarray data were analyzed using Rosetta Resolver.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. cDNA was prepared with
SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and random primers. Quantitative PCR analysis
was done on a 7900HT SDS with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). Gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table S1) were designed
using Primer Express software. cDNA equivalent to 25 ng RNA was used as
PCR template. Sample variation was normalized by 18S RNA. Samples were
run in duplicate using the default thermal profile. Dissociation curve
analysis was done after completion of PCR to confirm the specificity of
amplified products.
Statistical methods. Analysis of covariance on the tumor volume at
specific time points was applied for the tumor efficacy studies. P values of
the multiple comparisons at each time point were adjusted by Hochberg’s
method. Two-sample t tests were used to analyze results from the Mature
Prostate Weight Model and PSA serum levels.

Results
BMS-641988 has potent in vitro antiandrogen activity. BMS641988 was identified as a novel and highly potent series of [2.2.1]oxobicyclo-imide–based AR antagonists (ref. 27; Fig. 1A). BMS641988 binds to the endogenous wild-type AR with 20-fold higher
affinity compared with the standard antiandrogen bicalutamide
as determined by [3H]DHT competition assays done with MDAMB-453 cells (Table 1). BMS-641988 binds with high selectivity to

the AR compared with the glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors (data not shown). To determine the effect of BMS-641988
on the transcriptional activity of the AR, cell lines expressing either
endogenous wild-type (MDA-MB-453) or mutant (LNCaP or 22rv1)
forms of the AR were transiently transfected with a construct
consisting of the secreted alkaline phosphatase or the luciferase
reporter genes driven by both the immediate promoter and the
enhancer of the human PSA gene. In these assays, BMS-641988
displayed between 3- and 7-fold increased antagonist activity of AR
transactivation compared with bicalutamide (Table 1). Interestingly, as observed with other potent antiandrogens (24, 28), BMS641988 stimulated the proliferation of LNCaP cells.
BMS-641988 exhibits potent antiandrogen activity in mature rats. The effect of BMS-641988 on the ventral prostate and
seminal vesicles, two organs normally regulated by androgens, was
tested in sexually mature male rats. As shown in Table 1, castration
promoted a dramatic reduction in the weights of ventral prostate
[5 F 3% with respect to the vehicle-treated controls (%C)] and
seminal vesicles (10 F 1%C). In addition, BMS-641988 produced a
significant reduction in the weight of ventral prostate compared
with bicalutamide (52 F 7%C versus 70 F 24%C; P = 0.013) at
1 mg/kg and in the weight of the seminal vesicles (32 F 3%C versus
50 F 5%C; P = 0.0035) when administered at 1 mg/kg as well as
when dosed at 3 mg/kg (26 F 6%C versus 33 F 15%C; P = 0.020).
To determine the effect of BMS-641988 and bicalutamide on the
rate of cellular proliferation in the prostate, tissue sections were
subjected to immunohistochemistry staining for the detection
of Ki-67 expression. As shown in Fig. 1B, prostates isolated from
control animals treated with vehicle alone showed nuclei positive
for Ki-67 (5.1% of all nuclei showed brown staining; Fig. 1C).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

Prostates from animals treated with BMS-641988 or bicalutamide at
3 mg/kg showed 2.1% and 4.7% of the nuclei stained positive,
respectively (P < 0.0001, t test). These results suggest a more marked
antiproliferative effect of BMS-641988 at that dose. Prostates from
castrated animals showed the lowest levels of proliferation (0.7%),
which is expected because prostates do not develop in the absence
of androgen signaling.
The use of sexually mature rats allowed the assessment of the
effects of the compounds on the androgen-controlled hypothalamic-pituitary-endocrine axis, specifically on the changes in the serum
levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone. As the result of its
potent antiandrogen activity, BMS-641988, at its highest dose, significantly increased the serum levels of serum luteinizing hormone
and testosterone compared with vehicle-treated controls (Table 1).
BMS-641988 has potent antitumor activity in the human
prostate cancer model CWR-22-BMSLD1. The CWR-22 human
tumor xenograft model was derived from a primary adenocarcinoma of the prostate of a patient undergoing prostatectomy
(29, 30). The AR in this tumor line exhibits a H874Y substitution in the ligand-binding domain (31). CWR-22 cells grow in
athymic male mice without testosterone supplementation,
unlike the original tumor line developed by Pretlow and
colleagues (29).
Paradoxically, CWR-22-BMSLD1 cells retain sensitivity to
endogenous circulating levels of androgens, because marked TGI
occurs on castration. With regard to antiandrogen sensitivity,
CWR-22-BMSLD1 tumors are marginally responsive to flutamide
(data not shown) or bicalutamide (Fig. 2A). Thus, this model is
appropriate to investigate the antitumor activity of BMS-641988
(10, 30, and 90 mg/kg) compared with bicalutamide (50 and

150 mg/kg). Both compounds were administered p.o. once a day 
37. BMS-641988 (90 mg/kg) showed a markedly superior, dosedependent antitumor effect with significant (P < 0.05) activity at
all doses tested compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2A;
Table 2A). Furthermore, at 90 mg/kg, minimal increases in tumor
growth were observed over time: the median tumor size at initiation and end of treatment was of 106 and 144 mm3, respectively.
Conversely, animals treated with 150 mg/kg bicalutamide had
tumors that grew progressively (Fig. 2A).
On cessation of treatment, tumors restored their capacity to
grow. However, treatment with 90 mg/kg BMS-641988 delayed
progression of tumor growth to target size (1,000 mm3), as
indicated by a T-C of 36 days (approximately three TVDT),
whereas 150 mg/kg bicalutamide only delayed tumor growth to
target size by 12 days (approximately one TVDT). All doses of
BMS-641988 and bicalutamide were well tolerated throughout the
study (data not shown).
It was also investigated whether mice treated for 30 days with
BMS-641988 had decreased serum PSA levels, a surrogate marker
for tumor burden in humans (32) and, in this case, an in vivo
pharmacodynamic endpoint of antiandrogen activity. BMS-641988
was evaluated at its optimal dose of 90 mg/kg compared with
bicalutamide at 150 mg/kg (Table 2B). BMS-641988 treatment
resulted in almost complete stasis of tumor growth (%TGI = 95%),
whereas bicalutamide showed marginal antitumor activity
(%TGI = 33%). Similar to its antitumor activity, BMS-641988
reduced PSA levels >80% compared with vehicle controls, whereas
bicalutamide reduced PSA levels by only 20% to 50%.

BMS-641988 shows antitumor activity in CWR-22-BMSLD1
tumors that progress during bicalutamide treatment. BMS641988 was tested in CWR-22-BMSLD1 xenografts that failed
bicalutamide treatment. Fourteen days after initiation of treatment
(day 21), the group receiving daily bicalutamide 150 mg/kg showed
a 3-fold increase in median tumor size. At this point, the animals
were randomized into two groups (Fig. 2B, arrow). The first group
continued to be treated with bicalutamide at 150 mg/kg, and
the second group was switched to treatment with BMS-641988 at
90 mg/kg. There was a significant delay of tumor growth in the
group switched to BMS-641988 compared with the bicalutamideonly group (Fig. 2B, days 43-56; Table 2C; P < 0.05). Clearly, tumors
from animals switched to BMS-641988 showed minimal growth,
whereas tumors from animals treated with bicalutamide alone
grew progressively. As seen in previous studies, BMS-641988 as a
single agent showed efficacy at 90 mg/kg with a T-C of 35 days.
Conversely, bicalutamide (150 mg/kg) in mice bearing CWR-22BMSLD1 tumors that failed a suboptimal dose of BMS-641988 did
not inhibit tumor growth (data not shown).
Antitumor activity of BMS-641988 in the LuCaP 23.1 human

evaluated in LuCaP 23.1 cells (33), a human prostate tumor line
that presents two copies of the wild-type AR gene, expresses high
levels of PSA, responds to bicalutamide, and is androgen dependent
(34). BMS-641988 at doses of 10, 30, and 90 mg/kg and bicalutamide at doses of 16.7 and 150 mg/kg produced significant
inhibition of tumor growth (P < 0.01; Fig. 3; Table 2D ). Once
treatments ended, tumors treated with both bicalutamide and

BMS-641988 began to grow at similar rates. These data suggest that,
in a tumor model sensitive to bicalutamide, BMS-641988 produced
significant antitumor activity within a wide range of doses.
BMS-641988 generates a transcriptomic profile that more
closely resembles to castration than does bicalutamide. To
elucidate mechanistic differences, the global gene expression of
CWR-22-BMSLD1 human prostate xenografts in nude mice treated
was compared with vehicle control, castration and 90 mg/kg
BMS-641988 or 150 mg/kg bicalutamide, the doses with maximal
antitumor activity. Gene expression was profiled on Affymetrix
U133A DNA microarray chips. Three hundred fifty-six transcripts
significantly changing among the treatments (defined as P < 0.01
and z2-fold change for at least two of three time points in a
treatment group) showed a significantly higher correlation between
BMS-641988 and castration than between bicalutamide and castration (a correlation of 92% versus 67% following 7 days of treatment; Fig. 4A).
More than 50 PCR probe sets that displayed high confidence
changes on the DNA microarray analysis were selected, and the
responses to 7 days of castration were confirmed by quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR. The fold changes (castration versus control) from the Affymetrix chips analysis correlated well with those
from quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Supplementary
Table S2). In addition, the profile for several of the genes tested
(IGFBP3, FKBP5, and ODC1) correlated with previous reports
(35–37). The similarity between BMS-641988 treatment and castration on several genes was further confirmed by ANOVA of the microarray data (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S1). The similarities between
the global effects exhibited by treatment with BMS-641988 and castration are striking and grant further investigation of BMS-641988.

Discussion
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in
men in the United States, and although androgen ablation
modalities have been used effectively as palliative therapies over
the past 60 years, they are almost never curative. The AR plays a
key role in the etiology and progression of prostate cancer (7, 38).
Highlighting its importance, the expression of the AR is preserved
in most prostate cancer specimens independently of the stage and
grade. Unlike the ER in breast cancer, the AR is rarely lost; for example, Sasaki and colleagues reported that only 3 of 38 (8%) HRPC
patient specimens presented methylation of the AR promoter;
similarly, all normal tissues studied were unmethylated (39). The
understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the
prostate cancer transition to a hormone-refractory stage remains
a challenge, both therapeutically and experimentally. However, a
large amount of evidence supports the notion that functional AR
signaling is required for the growth of castration-resistant prostate
cancer and that more potent antiandrogens could address many of
the proposed resistance mechanisms (7). In this report, data are
presented on the preclinical characterization of BMS-641988, a
member of a novel and highly potent series of [2.2.1]-oxobicycloimide–based AR antagonists (27).
In most studies presented herein, BMS-641988 was compared
directly with bicalutamide (Casodex; AstraZeneca), the most widely
used antiandrogen in the clinic. BMS-641988 is an androgencompetitive inhibitor that binds to the endogenous AR with 20-fold
higher affinity compared with bicalutamide. It exhibits between
3- and 7-fold increased potency as an antagonist of both wild-4type
and mutant AR transcriptional activity compared with the standard antiandrogen. Although BMS-641988 showed potent antagonist
activity in transactivation assays done with LNCaP cells transiently

transfected with the artificial reporter constructs, it promoted
the proliferation of these cells. This agonist activity has been
observed with other potent antiandrogens, such as nilutamide and
flutamide. This effect was attributed to the altered ligand
specificity of a mutant AR (40). Although the real incidence of
AR mutations in prostate cancer is not known, it has been reported
to be between 10% and 40% (7). Interestingly, exposure to
antiandrogens could promote the selection for certain mutant
forms of the AR; for example, sequencing of the AR expressed in
bone marrow samples of histologically prostate cancer–positive

www.aacrjournals.org

biopsies showed that 5 of 16 patients previously treated with longterm hydroxyflutamide presented mutations in codon 877 compared with only 1 (in codon 890) of 17 patients who did not receive
this drug (41). Two additional AR mutants (W741C or W741L) were
isolated from prostate cells, the growth of which is induced by
bicalutamide (42, 43), and BMS-641988 is a strong antagonist of
both of them (Supplementary Fig. S2). Unfortunately, further
understanding of the clinical relevance of these mutations has been
hampered by the difficulty in accessing large numbers of
metastatic prostate cancer samples (7, 44).

tumors were s.c. implanted in male nude
mice. Treatments were administered p.o.
once a day  70 (empty triangles).

The potent in vitro antiandrogenic activity of BMS-641988 was
evident by its effect on the secondary sexual organs of mature male
rats after 14 days of treatment. BMS-641988 produced a significant
reduction in the weights of the ventral prostate and the seminal
vesicles as well as in the percent of nuclei stained positively for the
proliferation marker Ki-67 in prostate sections compared with the
values derived from animals treated with vehicle control. In addi-

tion, the highest dose of BMS-641988 yielded a significant increase
in serum levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone compared
with the levels attained with the same dose of bicalutamide.
BMS-641988 had significant antitumor activity in the human
xenograft model CWR-22-BMSLD1, a tumor model derived from
advanced prostate cancer and established in our laboratory in the
absence of testosterone supplementation. CWR-22-BMSLD1 was

marginally sensitive to 150 mg/kg bicalutamide, which yields 3-fold
higher steady-state exposures in mice than in humans (150 versus
52 Amol/L; ref. 45). Furthermore, tumors treated with bicalutamide
grew progressively during treatment. Conversely, only minimal
increases in tumor growth were observed over time in the group
treated with the highest dose of BMS-641988. On cessation of
treatments, tumors recovered their growth capacity; however, animals receiving the highest dose of BMS-641988 showed a 3-fold
delay in target tumor progression compared with those receiving
the highest dose of bicalutamide. In addition, BMS-641988 was
active in the androgen-dependent LuCaP 23.1 xenograft model.
The effectiveness of BMS-641988 as a second-line hormonal
therapy was explored. Several studies have shown the benefits of
such approaches in the clinic; for example, nilutamide treatment
promoted a 50% reduction in PSA in 29% of patients whose disease
had progressed on flutamide or bicalutamide (46). A retrospective
data analysis showed that 40% of patients who received nilutamide
as second-line hormonal therapy experienced >50% reduction in
PSA with a median time to progression of 4.4 months (47). More
recently, a multicenter trial followed the clinical outcome of 232
patients with advanced prostate cancer who relapsed to first-line
therapy (surgical or medical castration combined with a nonsteroidal antiandrogen) after switching to a second antiandrogen.
These studies showed that 61.2% of the patients showed a PSA
decrease (>50%) in response to an alternative antiandrogen and
that these responders had significantly better survival than nonresponders (48). Our studies show that BMS-641988 therapy
promoted stasis of CWR-22-BMSLD1 tumor growth that had
tripled in size under bicalutamide treatment, whereas tumors from
animals continuing under bicalutamide alone grew progressively.
On the other hand, bicalutamide did not delay the growth of the
tumors progressing in animals receiving suboptimal doses of BMS641988 (data not shown). These results support the testing of BMS641988 as a second-line hormonal therapy in the clinic.
It has been reported for the estrogen receptor that different
ligands can promote the recruitment of different peptides corresponding to coactivators and corepressors (49). Therefore, it is conceivable that BMS-641988 and bicalutamide, two distinct chemical
entities, could promote, on binding to the AR, different conformations with different capacities to recruit coactivators and/or corepressors, ultimately mediating distinct effects on AR-dependent
gene expression. Those potential differences were explored by
comparing the global gene expression profile in CWR-22-BMSLD1

tumors from mice subjected with the comparison of treatments.
This approach suggests that BMS-641988 promotes qualitative and
quantitative changes in the mRNA expression profiles more similar
to the changes promoted by castration when compared with bicalutamide. These results need to be further validated at the protein
level. This supports the hypothesis that, based on their chemical
differences, BMS-641988 and bicalutamide could promote distinct
ligand-AR conformations with distinct transcriptional activity.
Furthermore, the closer similarities between BMS-641988 treatment
and surgical castration are compelling and could imply therapeutic
benefits, because it has been shown that castration promotes
apoptosis in this tumor model (50). On the other hand, BMS-641988
faces, as other antiandrogens, two main challenges. The first
challenge is the plasticity of cancer cells in general and of the AR
in particular; the resistance mechanisms already mentioned to be
involved in castration-resistant prostate cancer could also apply to
BMS-641988. The second challenge is the existence of constitutive
active variants of the AR that lack the ligand-binding domain and
therefore would not be affected by BMS-641988; patients expressing these isoforms should not be treated with antiandrogens. In
summary, BMS-641988 is a novel and potent antiandrogen that is
active in human prostate xenograft models, including CWR-22BMSLD1 failing bicalutamide treatment. Furthermore, BMS-641988
presents a gene expression signature similar to surgical castration in
the preclinical experimental model tested. These data offer
opportunities to further understand the biology of antiandrogens
and their utility for the treatment of prostate cancer.
