Abstract

Introduction

Resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer, a
leading cause of cancer deaths. Therefore, novel strategies are
required to target apoptosis resistance. Here, we report that
the combination of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)
inhibition and tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) is an effective approach to trigger
apoptosis despite Bcl-2 overexpression and to suppress
pancreatic cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown
of XIAP by RNA interference cooperates with TRAIL to induce
caspase activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential,
cytochrome c release, and apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma
cells. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release are extensively inhibited by a broad range or
caspase-3 selective caspase inhibitor and by RNAi-mediated
silencing of caspase-3, indicating that XIAP inhibition
enhances TRAIL-induced mitochondrial damage in a caspase-3–dependent manner. XIAP inhibition combined with
TRAIL even breaks Bcl-2–imposed resistance by converting
type II cells that depend on the mitochondrial contribution
to the death receptor pathway to type I cells in which TRAILinduced activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and apoptosis
proceeds irrespective of high Bcl-2 levels. Most importantly,
XIAP inhibition potentiates TRAIL-induced antitumor activity
in two preclinical models of pancreatic cancer in vivo. In the
chicken chorioallantoic membrane model, XIAP inhibition
significantly enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and suppression of tumor growth. In a tumor regression model in
xenograft-bearing mice, XIAP inhibition acts in concert with
TRAIL to cause even regression of established pancreatic
carcinoma. Thus, this combination of XIAP inhibition plus
TRAIL is a promising strategy to overcome apoptosis
resistance of pancreatic cancer that warrants further investigation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7956–65]

Despite intensive protocols, treatment resistance of pancreatic
cancer considerably contributes to the poor prognosis of this
disease (1, 2). Evasion of apoptosis (programmed cell death) can
lead to treatment failure in pancreatic cancer because intact
apoptosis pathways are crucial for therapy-induced cytotoxicity
(3, 4). Thus, new strategies that target apoptosis resistance are
required to improve the dismal prognosis of pancreatic cancer
patients.
Two principal apoptosis pathways eventually lead to activation
of caspases, i.e., the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway and the
mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway (4, 5). Ligation of death
receptors, e.g., agonistic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors by TRAIL, results in
caspase-8 activation that cleaves effector caspase-3 either directly
or indirectly via the mitochondrial route (6). In the mitochondrial
pathway, effector caspases are activated upon the release of
apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c or second mitochondriaderived activator of caspase (Smac)/direct inhibitor of apoptosis
protein (IAP) binding protein with low PI (DIABLO) from
mitochondria into the cytosol (7). Cytochrome c triggers caspase3 activation via formation of the cytochrome c/caspase-9/Apaf-1
apoptosome complex, whereas Smac/DIABLO promotes apoptosis
by neutralizing IAPs (7). The mitochondrial contribution to death
receptor signaling is of special relevance in type II cells, for example
pancreatic carcinoma, which rely on the apoptotic function of
mitochondria for full activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis (8–10).
In type I cells, caspase-8 is activated upon death receptor
ligation at the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) in
quantities sufficient to directly activate caspase-3 (8). Accordingly,
blocking the mitochondrial pathway, e.g., by overexpression of
Bcl-2, inhibits death receptor-induced apoptosis in type II but not
in type I cells (8).
Among the death receptor ligands, TRAIL is considered as the
most promising candidate for medical application because it
triggers apoptosis preferentially in cancer cells with no or minimal
toxicity to nonmalignant human cells (11). However, many human
cancers including pancreatic carcinoma display primary or
acquired resistance to TRAIL (9, 12). X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
(XIAP) may contribute to resistance to TRAIL because XIAP blocks
apoptosis at a key node of the apoptotic machinery through
inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-9 (13, 14). Searching for
strategies to restore sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer, we investigated XIAP as a molecular target
in vitro and in vivo.

XIAP Inhibition Breaks Bcl-2 Resistance to TRAIL

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. Pancreatic carcinoma cell lines PancTu1 and
PaTuII were established from distinct human poorly differentiated
pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens (15, 16) and cultured in RPMI1640
(Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (12). TRAIL was purchased from R&D
Systems, Inc., and all chemicals from Sigma unless indicated otherwise.
Transduction and transfection. To knockdown XIAP, shRNA targeting
XIAP sequence 241 (gtggtagtcctgtttcagc; ref. 17) corresponding to mRNA
sequence were cloned into pRETRO-SUPER as previously described (12).
A sequence with no corresponding part in the human genome (gatcatgtagatacgctca) was used as control. Stable bulk cultures were generated by
selection with 2 Ag/mL puromycin and clones by limited dilutions. For
RNAi-mediated knockdown of caspase-3, cells were transiently transfected
twice with 0.06 nmol caspase-3 Stealth or control RNAi (Invitrogen) using
TransMessenger (Qiagen). For Bcl-2 overexpression, cells were transduced
with pMSCV vector containing mouse Bcl-2 or empty vector using the
packaging cell line PT67 (BD Biosciences). Stable cell lines were selected by
10 Ag/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen).
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed as
described previously (18) using the following antibodies: mouse anti–
caspase-8 (ApoTech Corporation), rabbit anti–caspase-3 (Cell Signaling),
rabbit anti–caspase-9, mouse anti–caspase-2, mouse anti–caspase-7,

mouse anti-XIAP from BD Biosciences, mouse anti-mouse Bcl-2 (Zymed),
or mouse anti–h-actin (Sigma) followed by goat-anti-mouse IgG or goatanti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection
(Amersham Bioscience).
Bax immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed for 25 min in CHAPS lysis
buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% CHAPS]. Five
hundred micrograms of protein were incubated with 4 Ag mouse anti-Bax
antibody (6A7; Sigma) overnight at 4jC on rotator followed by addition of
10 AL Dynabeads Pan Mouse IgG (Dako) and incubated for 2 h at 4jC on
rotator. Beads were washed thrice with CHAPS lysis buffer. Immune
complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-BaxNT
antibody (Upstate Biotechnology).
Determination of apoptosis and cell viability. Apoptosis was
determined by Annexin-V staining or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis of DNA fragmentation of propidium iodide–stained nuclei
as described (12). Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics).
Determination of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release. CMXRos (1 Amol/L; Molecular Probes) was used to
measure the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Cells were incubated
for 30 min at 37jC in the presence of the fluorochrome and immediately

Xenograft mouse model. PancTu1 cells (1  106) transduced with control
or XIAP shRNA were s.c. inoculated at left and right dorsal sides, respectively,
of 6-wk-old female NMRI/nu-nu mice (Janvier Laboratories). Treatment
started 1 wk after tumor cell inoculation by daily i.p. injection of isoleucine
zipper–TRAIL (22) for 10 consecutive d, TRAIL maintenance buffer served as
control. Tumor size was assessed twice weekly by caliper; the tumor volume

was calculated according to the formula 0.5  L  W  T (L, length; W, width;
T, thickness). Relative tumor growth ratio (treated versus control, T/C) was
calculated by tumor volume in treated group divided by tumor volume in
control group. At the end of experiments, tumors were recovered for
histologic and pathologic analysis. Additional 3 mice were sacrificed 24 h
after the second injection of TRAIL on day 10 of the experiment, and tumor
tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Animal experiments
were performed in accordance with relevant institutional and national
regulations; research protocols were approved by relevant authorities.

Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining was performed
with 1:1 hematoxyline and 0.5% eosin, anti–Ki-67 (Dako) or anticleaved
caspase-3 antibody (Biozol) as previously described (23). Apoptosis was
assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL; Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Negative controls were performed by omitting the first step
with primary antibody and yielded negative results. The percentage of
positive cells was independently determined by two examiners.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was assessed by Student’s
t test or Mann-Whitney U test, where appropriate, using Winstat (R. Fitch

Results
XIAP knockdown sensitizes pancreatic carcinoma cells for
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To antagonize XIAP in pancreatic
cancer, we generated clones of PancTu1 and PaTuII pancreatic
carcinoma cells in which XIAP was substantially down-regulated by
retroviral short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors (Fig. 1A). Knockdown
of XIAP significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a
concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B and C; XIAP
shRNA clone 10 for PancTu1 cells, XIAP shRNA clone 4 for PaTuII
cells). Similar results were obtained in distinct clones with XIAP
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and also in another
pancreatic carcinoma cell line, i.e., Colo357 (12). For subsequent
experiments, XIAP shRNA clone 10 were used for PancTu1 cells
and XIAP shRNA clone 4 for PaTuII cells. Apoptotic cell death was
confirmed by analysis of DNA fragmentation and by typical
morphologic features, e.g., nuclear condensation and fragmentation (data not shown). Furthermore, XIAP knockdown cooperated
with TRAIL to suppress clonogenic survival (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). By comparison, XIAP knockdown did not significantly
alter chemotherapeutic drug–induced cytotoxicity in PancTu1 and
PaTuII cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C). We also extended our study
to another IAP protein, i.e., survivin (24). Knockdown of survivin
significantly increased apoptosis without the addition of TRAIL
and also acted in concert with TRAIL to induce apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Together, these findings show that
inhibition of XIAP or survivin sensitizes pancreatic carcinoma
cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
XIAP knockdown enhances TRAIL-induced caspase activation and mitochondrial perturbations. Next, we explored
molecular mechanisms responsible for the cooperative action of
XIAP inhibition and TRAIL in pancreatic carcinoma cells. Analysis
of caspase activity by enzymatic caspase assay revealed that XIAP
knockdown significantly increased TRAIL-induced activation of
caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-2 (Fig. 2A). Activation
of caspases was also confirmed by detection of active caspase
cleavage fragments by Western blotting (data not shown). Addition
of the broad range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk extensively
inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cells with XIAP knockdown
(Supplementary Fig. S3), demonstrating that apoptosis occurs in a
caspase-dependent manner.
Furthermore, we investigated whether XIAP inhibition has an
effect on the mitochondrial pathway during TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. XIAP knockdown significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced
loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c
release from mitochondria in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B
and C). We also assessed Bid cleavage and Bax conformational
change as possible links between caspase activation and mitochondrial injury. XIAP knockdown enhanced TRAIL-induced Bid
cleavage as well as Bax activation as indicated by higher levels of
conformationally active Bax in TRAIL-treated cells with XIAP

knockdown compared with control cells, whereas total levels of
Bax protein were not up-regulated in cells with XIAP knockdown
(Fig. 2D). Together, this shows that XIAP inhibition cooperates with
TRAIL to trigger caspase activation and mitochondrial perturbations in pancreatic carcinoma cells.
XIAP knockdown promotes TRAIL-induced mitochondrial
perturbations in a caspase-dependent manner. Because we
observed an increase in caspase activity before mitochondrial
perturbations in TRAIL-treated cells with XIAP knockdown
(Fig. 2A–C), we asked whether caspases are involved in causing
mitochondrial damage. To address this issue, we examined the
effect of the broad range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk and the
relatively specific caspase-3 inhibitor zDEVD.fmk on mitochondrial
apoptogenic functions upon treatment with TRAIL. zVAD.fmk as
well as zDEVD.fmk extensively blocked TRAIL-induced loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release
(Fig. 3A and B). In a second approach, we specifically knocked
down caspase-3 by RNA interference because chemical inhibitors of
caspases lack absolute substrate specificity (25). Control experiments showed that caspase-3 siRNA caused down-regulation of
caspase-3 with no detectable effects on expression levels of caspase7, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-2 (Fig. 3C). Interestingly,
silencing of caspase-3 significantly reduced TRAIL-induced loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release
(Fig. 3D). This indicates that XIAP inhibition promotes TRAILinduced mitochondrial damage in a caspase-3–dependent manner.
XIAP knockdown overcomes Bcl-2–mediated resistance to
TRAIL. Because pancreatic carcinoma cells have been reported to
classify as type II cells that express antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins at high levels and depend on the mitochondrial
contribution to death receptor–induced apoptosis (9), we next
asked whether blockade of the mitochondrial pathway impairs
apoptosis induced by the combination of XIAP knockdown and
TRAIL. To address this issue, we stably overexpressed Bcl-2 in cells
with XIAP knockdown (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, XIAP knockdown
enhanced TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity irrespective of Bcl-2 overexpression, whereas Bcl-2 overexpression conferred resistance to
TRAIL in control cells with high XIAP expression (Fig. 4B). Also,
XIAP knockdown increased TRAIL-induced cleavage of caspase-3
into the active p17/p12 cleavage fragments and cleavage of
caspase-9 regardless of high Bcl-2 levels (Fig. 4C).
To elucidate whether XIAP knockdown bypasses the requirement
of the mitochondrial pathway for TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Bcl2–overexpressing cells or whether it alternatively breaks mitochondrial resistance, we examined variables of mitochondrial apoptosis
that are controlled by Bcl-2 (26). Bcl-2 overexpression failed to
inhibit loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c
release in TRAIL-treated cells with XIAP knockdown, whereas it
significantly reduced these mitochondrial perturbations in control
cells with high XIAP expression (Fig. 4D). This set of experiments
shows that XIAP knockdown converts type II pancreatic carcinoma
cells, in which Bcl-2 confers protection against TRAIL, to type I cells
in which TRAIL triggers activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and
apoptosis regardless of high Bcl-2 levels.
XIAP knockdown enhances TRAIL-induced antitumor activity against pancreatic carcinoma in vivo. We then evaluated the
antitumor activity of concomitant XIAP inhibition and TRAIL
in vivo using the CAM model, an established in vivo tumor model
(21, 27). To this end, PancTu1 cells transduced with XIAP or control
shRNA were seeded on the CAM of chicken embryos, allowed to
form tumors, and then treated with TRAIL. Importantly, XIAP

suppressed the growth of pancreatic carcinoma in vivo (Fig. 5A).
Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissue revealed that XIAP
knockdown significantly increased TRAIL-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis and also acted in concert with TRAIL to
suppress proliferation (Fig. 5B–D). This shows that XIAP inhibition

of pancreatic cancer in vivo.

been established. Strikingly, XIAP knockdown cooperated with
TRAIL to cause regression of established pancreatic carcinoma in
a dose-dependent manner, an effect that was sustained also after
discontinuation of TRAIL treatment (Fig. 6A and B ). By
comparison, TRAIL treatment alone only slowed down growth of
control tumors (Fig. 6A and B). XIAP knockdown substantially
enhanced the TRAIL-induced reduction in tumor volume even at
the lowest dose of TRAIL, with T/C ratios of 4%, 0.3%, or 0.3% upon
treatment with 20, 50, or 125 Ag TRAIL in tumors with XIAP
knockdown compared with T/C ratios of 63%, 44%, or 42% upon
treatment with 20, 50, or 125 Ag TRAIL in control tumors (Fig. 6A).
Similarly, analysis of tumor weight showed that TRAIL treatment
was more effective in pancreatic carcinoma with XIAP knockdown
compared with control tumors (Fig. 6C). The suppressive effect of
XIAP knockdown alone on tumor growth in xenografted tumors
suggests that the XIAP-mediated survival effect may become
relevant under cellular stress conditions in vivo, i.e., under hypoxia,
as XIAP is translationally up-regulated via an internal ribosome
entry site during hypoxia (28).
In parallel, we monitored apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma
tissue in situ during the course of TRAIL treatment. To this end,
three additional mice of each treatment group were sacrificed
24 h after the second injection of TRAIL on day 10 of the
experiment and tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. TRAIL-treated pancreatic carcinoma with XIAP
knockdown displayed a significant increase in cells with cleaved
caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity and a reduction of Ki-67–positive
cells (Fig. 6D). These findings reflect at the cellular level in tumor
tissue in vivo that XIAP inhibition acts in concert with TRAIL to
trigger apoptosis and to suppress tumor growth. Notably, no
signs of acute or delayed toxicity were observed during treatment
or at the end of the experiment as assessed by clinical
observation, body weight, blood cell counts, and liver enzymes
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Together, this set of experiments in
xenograft-bearing mice shows that XIAP inhibition strongly
augments the antitumor activity of TRAIL, causing regression of
established pancreatic carcinoma in vivo without detectable
toxicities to normal tissues.

Discussion
Evasion of apoptosis is a key factor preventing treatment
responses in pancreatic cancer, a leading cause of cancer deaths
(3). This highlights the need for novel strategies to overcome
apoptosis resistance to improve the outcome of this lethal disease.
In response to this demand, we develop in the present study the
combination of XIAP inhibition plus TRAIL as an effective
approach to trigger apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma, which
overcomes Bcl-2–mediated resistance and even causes regression
of established tumors in vivo. This conclusion is supported by the
following pieces of evidence. First, neutralizing XIAP by RNA
interference acts in concert with TRAIL to trigger apoptosis in
pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro. Second, the combination of
XIAP inhibition and TRAIL breaks Bcl-2–imposed resistance by
converting type II pancreatic carcinoma cells to type I cells. Third,
inhibition of XIAP substantially enhances the antitumor activity of
TRAIL against pancreatic cancer in two preclinical models in vivo.
Importantly, the combination of XIAP inhibition and TRAIL causes
regression of established pancreatic carcinoma in xenograftbearing mice. Together, these results show that XIAP inhibition is
a powerful strategy to potentiate the antitumor activity of TRAIL
against pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

Conceptually, we show for the first time that down-regulation of
XIAP breaks Bcl-2–mediated resistance to TRAIL, switching type II
pancreatic carcinoma cells that depend on the mitochondrial
contribution to the death receptor pathway to type I cells in which
TRAIL-induced apoptosis proceeds irrespective of high Bcl-2 levels.
Neutralizing XIAP enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis at the
postmitochondrial level by relieving the XIAP-mediated inhibition
of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Thus, XIAP inhibition elicits apoptosis
also in cells in which the mitochondrial pathway is blocked, e.g.,
by antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. It is interesting to note that
there is recent evidence that caspase-9 activation can occur in
certain cell types in the absence of a functional apoptosome as long
as XIAP is kept in check (29). Also, our data indicate that inhibition
of XIAP enhances TRAIL-induced mitochondrial breakdown by
promoting caspase-3 activation. Caspase-3 may act back on
mitochondria by cleaving Bid, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins,
and/or components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (26,
30–33). By comparison, g-irradiation and DNA-damaging anticancer drugs were shown to cooperate with TRAIL in Bcl-2
overexpressing cells by bypassing the mitochondrial pathway via
enhanced TRAIL DISC formation without causing mitochondrial
disassembling (34, 35). Because antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins
have been reported to be expressed at high levels in pancreatic
cancer and to contribute to apoptosis resistance (2, 9), bypassing
the requirement for mitochondrial apoptogenic events in the
course of TRAIL-induced apoposis, e.g., by inhibition of XIAP, may
have important implications to restore sensitivity to TRAIL in
pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, it will be interesting to explore
whether the combination of TRAIL and XIAP inhibition may
bypass c-FLIP–imposed apoptosis resistance because a novel
caspase-8 activation pathway has very recently been identified in
the course of TNFa plus Smac mimetic–triggered apoptosis that
is less sensitive to c-FLIP inhibition (36).
Our study also underscores the relevance of TRAIL-based
combination protocols for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The
antitumor activity of TRAIL receptor agonists that are currently
under evaluation in early clinical trials in various human
malignancies (37) may be impaired by resistance of pancreatic
carcinoma to TRAIL. This calls for rational combinations to target
defective apoptosis programs in pancreatic cancer. Our data
provide, for the first time, evidence that the combination of XIAP
inhibition plus TRAIL is a potent strategy to trigger regression of
established pancreatic carcinoma in xenograft-bearing mice without
detectable toxicities to normal tissues. Thus, our findings provide
the rationale to further develop the combination of XIAP inhibition
and TRAIL to overcome apoptosis resistance of pancreatic cancer.
