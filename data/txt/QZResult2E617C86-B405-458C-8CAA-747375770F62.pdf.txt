ABSTRACT
Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is overexpressed or mutated in several disorders
such as hematological cancers, and plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation,
cell cycle progression and developmental processes. Here, we performed comparative
transcriptome analyses in acute myeloid leukemia to investigate the biological
implications of HDAC2 silencing versus its enzymatic inhibition using epigenetic-based
drug(s). By gene expression analysis of HDAC2-silenced vs wild-type cells, we found
that HDAC2 has a specific role in leukemogenesis. Gene expression profiling of U937
cell line with or without treatment of the well-known HDAC inhibitor vorinostat (SAHA)
identifies and characterizes several gene clusters where inhibition of HDAC2 ‘mimics’
its silencing, as well as those where HDAC2 is selectively and exclusively regulated by
HDAC2 protein expression levels. These findings may represent an important tool for
better understanding the mechanisms underpinning immune regulation, particularly
in the study of major histocompatibility complex class II genes.

INTRODUCTION

Innovative strategies are therefore urgently needed. The
increasing understanding of AML biology has led to the
introduction of many novel anti-AML drugs [3]. Both
hematological and solid neoplasms, such as breast cancer,
may be caused by alterations in the balance between
histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases
(HDACs)[4]. Aberrant epigenetic modulations, including
deregulation of DNA methylation and other posttranslational histone modifications such as acetylation [5],
together with genetic mutations, are causally linked to
cancer. Acetylated histones are involved in an epigenetic
mechanism marking transcriptionally active regions of
chromatin [6]. Specifically, HATs and HDACs differently
regulate protein acetylation levels by modulating gene
expression and cellular signals. HATs catalyze the transfer
of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to the ε-NH2 group of
lysine residue side chains. In contrast, HDACs contain a
highly conserved deacetylase domain, which spans 300
amino acid residues and catalyzes hydrolytic release of the

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with a
distinct group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders
in which both failure to differentiate and over-proliferation
in the stem cell compartments result in accumulation of
non-functional immature cells termed ‘myeloblasts’.
Better insights into the genetic background of AML are
currently leading to a wide array of so-called ‘targeted
therapies’, many of which are in clinical development. The
AML classification system has evolved from being
morphologic- to cytogenetic/genetic-based, reflecting the
recognition of the importance of subtype-specific biology.
Recently, several molecular-based prognostic factors have
been described, although the impact of such findings on
treatment decisions remains unclear [1]. Standard
treatment of AML results in a median survival of
approximately one year [2] and outcomes of
myelodysplastic syndromes likewise remain poor.

acetyl group [7]. Hence, acetylation-dependent regulatory
pathways, in cooperation with additional post-translational
modifications, are key homeostasis determinants. In
mammals, 18 HDACs have been identified and grouped
into four classes. The class I enzymes HDAC1 and
HDAC2 are close homologs of yeast Rpd3, which is the
most important HDAC regulating total levels of histone
acetylation in yeast [8]. HDAC3 and HDAC8 also belong
to the class I HDAC family. Class IIa (HDAC4, HDAC5,
HDAC7, HDAC9) and IIb (HDAC6, HDAC10) family
members are related to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
HDAC Hda1p. HDAC11 shares some sequence homology
with class IIa and IIb HDACs and is the only member of
class IV. Class III HDACs, the mammalian sirtuins
(SIRT1–7), are homologs of S. cerevisiae silent
information regulator 2 (Sir2p). While class I, II and IV
HDACs use Zn2+ for catalysis, class III HDACs use NAD+
[9]. Structural homology and common catalytic
mechanism(s) can be considered as a functional
redundancy of HDACs [10]. However, many important
physiological functions, such as growth, differentiation,
and reactions to external and internal stimuli, may be
crucially controlled by a single HDAC. For example, gene
expression analyses in brain and cardiac tissues have
shown that, despite sharing 80% sequence homology,
HDAC1 and HDAC2 affect different sets of target genes.
Specifically, HDAC1 and HDAC2 are together involved in
early synaptogenesis, whereas HDAC2 has a wide-ranging
effect on synaptic transmission in mature neurons [11].
Aberrant expression of HDAC2 has been identified in
dystrophic muscles and chronically inflamed tissues [12],
as well as in prostate, ovarian, endometrial and gastric
cancer. HDAC2 expression and activity are both regulated
at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and posttranslational levels. HDAC2 occupies the promoter
regions of p21 and p57 genes, indicating that regulation of
their expression levels controls cell cycle progression. In
addition, both HDAC1 and HDAC2 promote G1-S phase
transition by inhibiting expression of p21 and p57 [13].
Furthermore, HDAC2 and N-Myc decrease p53
phosphorylation at serine 46, repressing gene transcription
of tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 [14].
HDAC2 is crucial for embryonic development, affects
cytokine signaling involved in immune responses, and is
often highly up-regulated in solid and hematological
tumors [12]. DNA damage is induced during tumor
evolution, and HDAC2 is overexpressed in many cancers
promoting the effective repair of DNA and regulating
histone acetylation, including acetylation of histone H4 on
lysine 16. This particular histone modification shows a
biphasic response to DNA damage as expression levels are
initially reduced, but increase in the long term due to DNA
repair. Indeed, replication stress produces an increase in
the expression of histone H4 acetylated on lysine 16 [15].
Nevertheless, transformed cells lacking HDAC2 as a result
of somatic mutations were recently described [16]. Studies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggest that both individual and specific groups of HDAC
enzymes may be associated with certain cancers, and
inhibition of HDACs could translate into therapeutic
benefit in malignancies. Furthermore, HDAC inhibitors
(HDACi) can also be used as sensitization agents in
chemotherapy or hormonal intervention [17]. HDACi have
been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation and
chromatin de-condensation, to inhibit angiogenesis, and to
induce apoptosis [18]. HDACi are classified into six
groups according to their chemical structure, and at least
12 are currently in clinical trials [19] [20] [21]. To date,
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
approved two HDACi, vorinostat (suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid or SAHA, Zolinza®) and romidepsin
(FK228, depsipeptide, Istodax®) for the second-line
treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Another widely
studied HDACi, entinostat (MS-275), is currently in
clinical trials for treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma and
advanced breast cancer. HDACi are also associated with
immune-modulatory effects, and much attention is being
focused on antigen-presenting cells, which are key
regulators of immune activation. The epigenetic silencing
of immune genes in cancer may result in a lower
checkpoint control and thus in cancer advancement.
Increased immune gene repression has been associated
with HDAC overexpression. The first study describing the
activation of silenced major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) genes in many tumor cells was performed with the
HDACi Tricostatin A (TSA) [22]. In vitro treatment with
HDACi can alter the acetylated state of chromatin and
trigger the transcription of silenced genes, including MHC
class II genes [23]. Systemic treatments with HDACi
could potentially enhance host immune responses by
correcting the negative effects of cancer cells on host
immunity. Recent studies revealed that HDACi-treated
tumor cells are capable of activating both innate and
adaptive immune responses in vivo [24]. Although tumor
suppressor and immune genes are often silenced by
HDACs in cancer cells, the mechanisms leading to
epigenetic silencing are still not well understood. In
particular, HDAC2 was reported to inhibit transcription of
the CIITA gene and expression of MHC class II genes in
human cervical cancer cell lines [25]. MHC class II genes
are required for the recognition of tumor cells by CD4+ T
cells, and antigen presentation via MHC class II is critical
for activation of adaptive immune responses. HDACi may
be used to modify immunity through multiple host and
tumor pathways to improve the efficacy of antitumor
therapy. Several HDACi are effective in selected immune
disease models. For example, treatment with SAHA
inhibits TNF-alpha and IL-6 production by stimulating
mesangial cells in vitro, and blocks renal disease
progression in a murine model of systemic lupus
erythematosus [26]. A well as elucidating the role of
HDAC2 in cellular fate, these findings indicate that
HDAC2 is a therapeutically important target that can be

controlled pharmacologically. Although it is clear that
inhibition of individual HDACs may elicit distinct
functions and impact on the biological effects of HDACi,
a systematic approach to understand the role of specific
HDAC silencing compared to the inhibitory effect of
HDACi has not yet been undertaken.
Here, we show that HDAC2 silencing induces
modulation of gene expression leading to strong
transcriptional activation. The lack of HDAC2 stably
determines chromatin changes and a different acetylation
state by promoting the transcriptional activation of specific
target genes. Furthermore, inhibition of HDAC2 leads to
the expression of genes involved in activation of immune
responses, such as genes in the human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) family [27], required in the effector stages of
antitumor immunity. Such active immunoregulation may
increase the efficacy of antitumor therapies. Interestingly,
by treating wild-type and HDAC2-silenced U937 AML
cells for 24 hours with or without SAHA we identified: a)
a subset of 163 genes specifically dependent on HDAC2
silencing but not on its inhibition; b) a subset of 582
genes specifically regulated by SAHA only in absence of
HDAC2; c) 466 genes exclusively regulated by SAHA,
where HDAC2 inhibition/expression is dispensable; d)
28 genes regulated by both SAHA and HDAC2 silencing
together; e) 66 genes regulated by SAHA or by HDAC2
silencing; f) 106 genes both regulated by HDAC2
inhibition and by SAHA alone; g) 1620 genes regulated
by SAHA only if HDAC2 is expressed.

finding that HDAC2 silencing reduces proliferation
and colony formation in leukemia cells. The fact that
HDAC1 and HDAC3 protein expression levels remained
unchanged with or without treatment using the HDACi
MS-275 or SAHA demonstrates both the selectivity
of HDAC2 silencing and the specific correlation of the
effects observed with the reduction in HDAC2 expression
(Figure 1D). To characterize the effects of HDAC2
silencing on chromatin, histone H3 and H4 acetylation
levels were tested. Although no differences in either total
H3 or H3K56 acetylation levels were detected between
scr and sh2 cells with or without treatment using MS-275
or SAHA, acetylation of H4K16 drastically decreased in
the sh2 clone (Figure 1E), suggesting that the so-called
‘epigenetic hallmark’ of cancer [28] might be decreased
and possibly account for the reduced proliferation of
tumor cells. Accordingly, when HDAC2 silencing was
induced in MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells using a
different sh2 target sequence and a different expression
vector (Figure 2A), we obtained similar levels of H3 and
H3K56 acetylation and a similar decrease in acetylation
levels of H4K16 (Figure 2B). Again in MDA-MB231
cells, both reduction in proliferation rate (Figure 2B and
2C) and (in this case) inhibition of migration potential in
real-time curves were detected (Figure 2D). When HDACi
response rate was assessed, we did not detect any major
difference between sh2 and scr cells, likely suggesting that
the presence of all the other HDACs is still sufficient for
HDACi treatment response (Supplementary Figure 1A-D).
Taken together, our results show that HDAC2
silencing reduces proliferation and migration of
hematopoietic and solid cancer cells without altering
HDACi anticancer effects in terms of apoptotic response
in these settings.

cancer

silencing in leukemia cells

HDAC2 gene is strongly upregulated in primary
human AML. Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) analysis of
cells derived from six AML patients showed a higher
HDAC2 expression as compared to normal expression
levels in CD34+ myeloid progenitors (Figure 1A and
Table 1). In order to investigate the role of deregulation
in AML, HDAC2 silencing in U937 AML cell line was
performed. More than 100 U937 HDAC2-silenced (sh2)
clones were tested for HDAC2 expression. The results
clearly indicate a decrease of about 80% in expression of
HDAC2 as shown, representatively, in one of the selected
sh2 clones by q-PCR (Figure 1A), Western blot and semiquantitative PCR (Figure 1B). When proliferation rate was
assessed, the intrinsic proliferation level in sh2 clone was
significantly lower than in scramble (scr) cells mimicking
wild-type HDAC2 expression (Figure 1B, bottom). In
addition, a colony formation assay was performed in
sh2 and scr U937 cells (Figure 1C), corroborating the

To evaluate the transcriptional impact of HDAC2
silencing, the gene expression profiles of sh2 and scr
clones were analyzed. T-test analysis revealed the presence
of 269 differentially expressed genes by applying a high
threshold of significance with a fold change >2 and an
FDR <0.01. Statistical analysis showed that about 80%
of the altered genes were upregulated when HDAC2 was
silenced (Figure 3A). Validation of the regulation of some
targets was performed and in each case corroborated the
data shown (Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology
analysis identified different cellular processes caused by
changes in gene expression following silencing of HDAC2
(Figure 3A). In particular, genes involved in regulation of
the immune system such as those in MHC class II were
up-regulated (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 2A-C
and Supplementary Table 1). MHC class II genes were

also shown to be modulated in MDA-MB231 cells, when
silenced for HDAC2 (Supplementary Figure 2B), strongly
supporting a direct and cell type-independent link between
HDAC2 expression and MHC class II gene regulation.

(Figure 3B, Supplementary Figure 2D), likely indicating
a late HDAC2-dependent response to SAHA. The fact
that 173 genes are only modulated by HDAC2 silencing
and not by SAHA indicates that this cluster specifically
requires HDAC2 expression but not its inhibition, likely
suggesting the involvement of an additional repressive
HDAC2 domain in the enzymatic pocket.
To corroborate and extend this hypothesis we also
treated HDAC2-silenced cells with SAHA. Interestingly,
when the gene expression profile induced by SAHA (24
hours) in both sh2 and scr cells was compared with that
of untreated sh2 cells (Figure 4A), a cluster of 163 genes
specifically dependent on HDAC2 expression (HDAC2
silencing-dependent genes) was identified. The genes
in this cluster were not modulated by HDAC inhibition
in either sh2 or scr U937 cells, indicating that only the
silencing of HDAC2 is essential for gene expression
modulation, and corroborating the fact that HDAC2repressive action is exerted via non-enzymatic functions
in these conditions. All the 163 target genes are contained
in the previously identified group of 173 genes (see Figure
3B). Namely, these genes were specifically altered by
HDAC2 silencing. Notably, related biological processes
include primarily MHC class II antigen expression and
defense response. These findings indirectly suggest that

Comparative analysis between HDAC inhibition
and HDAC2 knockdown identifies specific clusters
of HDAC2-modulated genes in AML
In order to determine which genes were specifically
modulated by enzymatic inhibition (enzyme function
required) or by HDAC2 knockdown (HDAC2 expression
required) or both, several comparative analyses were
performed. By comparing scr U937 cells treated with
SAHA for 6 and 24 hours with the sh2 clone expression
profile (Figure 3B), a cluster of 23 commonly regulated
genes is observed, strongly indicating the dependence
of these genes both on HDAC inhibition (SAHA) and
HDAC2 silencing (Figure 3B) in these settings. These 23
genes can therefore be considered as directly modulated
by HDAC2 inhibition in response to SAHA, although it
cannot be excluded that other HDACs might also play a
role. In addition, 71 genes were shown to be regulated
by both SAHA after 24 hours and by HDAC2 silencing

Impact of HDAC2 silencing on gene expression
and drug response: definition of HDAC2
expression-dependent gene modulation

HDAC2 overexpression in cancer might be strongly
related to repression of immune defense and immune
recognition of tumor cells. Furthermore, the fact that a
cluster of 582 genes was found to be specifically regulated
by SAHA in absence of HDAC2 suggests that these genes
are ‘drug responsive’ when HDAC2 is absent, indicating
that gene modulation might be favored by the absence
of HDAC2. In contrast, 1620 genes were exclusively
regulated by SAHA in presence of HDAC2, thus being
potentially dependent on HDAC2 enzymatic function
alone. The 466 genes commonly regulated by SAHA in
presence or absence of HDAC2 indicate that for this gene
cluster HDAC2 expression is dispensable. Lastly, 106
genes were regulated by both HDAC2 inhibition (SAHA)
and HDAC2 silencing.

A Gene Ontology analysis was performed and a
heat map was generated to better investigate the biological
mechanisms involved after HDAC2 silencing (Figure
4B). The sh2 clone treated with SAHA for 6 and 24
hours was further analyzed, confirming that modulation
of gene expression exerted by SAHA occurs when
HDAC2 is silenced and that this modulation is timedependent. Findings from these statistical tests likely
reflect the fact that gene expression may be repressed by
HDACs other than HDAC2 and that thus the inhibition

of several HDACs by SAHA might produce similar
results to HDAC2 silencing. Interestingly, 222 genes
were exclusively deregulated by HDAC2 silencing
and not by SAHA (Figure 4C). These 222 genes are
part of the cluster of 269 genes shown in Figure 3A,
corroborating and extending the finding that this group
comprises HDAC2 expression-dependent genes, which
are modulated only when HDAC2 is silenced, and not
enzymatically inhibited, suggesting a ‘non-druggable’
HDAC2 functional repression. It should be underlined
that our analysis quantitatively discriminates between
gene clusters modulated by HDAC2 enzymatic function
and clusters modulated by its expression.

areas and the recruitment of p300 with consequent
increase in acetylation levels. These results corroborate
and strengthen the role of HDAC2 in reducing gene
expression by repressing areas of chromatin that do not
allow p300 binding and consequent acetylation. Given
the role of target genes, these mechanism(s) may give
rise to reduced immunity surveillance within tumor cells
overexpressing HDAC2. Figure 6D shows a schematic
model illustrating the HDAC2 mechanism. In healthy
conditions, transcriptional machinery is active due to the

HDAC2 abrogates MHC class II gene expression
by altering binding complexes at promoters in
leukemia
In order to investigate the relationship between
basal expression of HDAC2 (Figure 1A) and expression
of genes in MHC class II, the most represented class
based on Gene Ontology analysis (Figure 3A and Figure
4A), qPCR was performed in six samples from different
patients affected by AML. In these settings, the expression
level of two different HLA genes, HLA-DRA and HLADPA1 taken as examples of HDAC2 expression-dependent
genes, is dramatically reduced (Figure 5A and 5B). In
full agreement, HLA-DP-DR and the transactivator
CIITA expression levels in HDAC2 silenced cells (sh2)
were upregulated (Figure 5C-D). Interestingly, rescue
experiments of HDAC2 function demonstrated that reexpression of HDAC2 in sh2 cells was able to reduce the
expression of MHC class II genes (HLA-DRA) (Figure
5E). Strengthening the repressive role of HDAC2 in a
non-enzymatic manner, three different HDAC2 catalytic
mutants displayed similar features in these settings
(Figure 5F). Given the opposite regulation of MHC class
II genes and HDAC2 expression, the promoters of these
two targets were selected for further investigation. A
bioinformatic analysis of transcription factors (TFs) and
binding site complexes of these promoters associated
with potential indirect HDAC2 binding to chromatin
was performed. Supplementary Table 2 and 3 contain
a list of the motifs for TFs found on the promoters of
these two genes which might be correlated to HDAC2.
Particular attention was given to regions that may contain
a p300 binding site. Figure 6A shows a schematic
representation of the promoters. Region 1 corresponds
to the area near ATG, while Region 2 corresponds to the
area that presumably contains a p300 binding site. ChIP
assays for each promoter region were performed by
immunoprecipitation with HDAC2, p300, acH4K16 and
acH3K9K14 (Figure 6B and 6C). Interestingly, the data
obtained for both promoters show an inverse correlation
between the presence of HDAC2 and acH4K16 in these

highly acetylated status of chromatin and low occupancy
of HDAC2. Conversely, in AML, transcription is inactive
as a result of HDAC2 upregulation and absence of
acetylation. In sh2 clone, transcription is activated by
restoring a condition very similar to the healthy state.
Finally, the HDAC2-mediated mechanism of repression
is one of the enzyme-independent functions exerted by
deacetylases in tumorigenesis.

H4K16ac, is specifically downmodulated in HDAC2silenced cells suggests decreased tumorigenicity, further
corroborated by the lower clonal potential of these cells.
This is also the case for specific chromatin areas where
silencing of HDAC2 determines p300 recruitment and a
general H3K9-14 acetylation, supporting a very complex
chromatin remodeling with possible prioritization of
acetylations. Nonetheless, the main impact of HDAC2
interference seems to be de-repression of immune
functional genes. Gene expression analysis indicates that
HLA complex genes are all upregulated, as are membrane
proteins such as MMP-1, cadherins, cathepsins, proteins
of gap junctions, integrins, proteins, and collagen,
validating the hypothesis that lack of HDAC2 leads to a
reorganization of complexes involved in the regulation
of immune response and extracellular matrix (ECM).
Following characterization of the gene expression profile
induced by HDAC2 silencing, sh2 and scr clones were
treated with the HDACi SAHA, which causes growth
arrest and apoptosis in many tumors both in vitro and
in vivo. We found a cluster of 163 genes modulated
by HDAC2 silencing but not by its inhibition, clearly
indicating that the functions performed by HDAC2
(and possibly other HDACs) are not purely enzymatic.
In agreement, HDAC2 rescue experiments in silenced
HDAC2 cells (sh2) using different catalytic mutants
strongly supported that the HDAC2 repressive role on
immune function is not (or not only) mediated by its
enzymatic activity. Our investigation identified genes
selectively regulated by the action of HDAC2. For
example, the MHC class II genes HLA-DRA and HLADPA1, located on chromosome 6, have been labeled as
targets of HDAC2. The MHC class II transactivator CIITA
is a key mediator of many immunological processes
through the transcriptional regulation of interferon
gamma. The transcriptional activity of CIITA is regulated
by several post-transcriptional modifications and, in
particular, interacts with HDAC2. HDAC2 antagonizes the
activity of CIITA by committing it to protein degradation.
Furthermore, CIITA is considered to be the main regulator
of MHC class II and therefore of immune response.

DISCUSSION
Epigenetics has a key impact on the regulation of
gene expression. Specifically, epigenetic modifications
affect vast areas of cell biology and are involved in many
human diseases. From a basic research point of view,
understanding how these mechanisms are implicated in
cancer and what the consequences are for tumorigenesis
is crucial. Furthermore, immune system deregulation
is closely associated with tumor development and
maintenance. Cancer immune escape is mediated by
both epigenetic events and genome aberrations involved
in tumor progression. Recent findings suggest that many
tumor cells do not present antigen, which drives the
activation of immune response. An altered expression
of MHC class II genes has been described in several
hematopoietic cancers [29]. This deregulation has been
correlated with highly aggressive potential, negative
prognosis and loss of immune surveillance [30]. In solid
tumors, however, the relationship between expression
and prognosis is still unclear [31]. Some studies have
reported that HDACi can turn on genes of the immune
system (such as MHC class I and II genes), thus helping to
recognize ‘non-self’ insults. Here, we functionally address
the role of HDAC2 in AML. Although interference with
HDAC2 expression in both hematological and solid
cancer cells clearly demonstrates that HDAC2 exerts
an anti-proliferative action, this does not seem to be its
primary activity. The presence of high expression levels of
other HDACs may influence the response of cancer cells
to HDACi even when HDAC2 is silenced. Interestingly,
the fact that the epi-mark of cancer progression [32],

CIITA is also involved in the modulation of a series of
genes including IL-4, IL-10, MMP9 and collagen type I,
underscoring its importance in immune response and in the
restructuring of ECM [33]. The investigation of responsive
promoters further supports the immune-modulatory effect
of HDAC2 silencing. In AML, the promoter regions of
both HLA-DRA and HLA-DPA1 display low acetylation
(H3K9-14), presence of HDAC2 and absence of HATs
such as p300, which has a predicted binding. Upon
HDAC2 silencing, the scenario is partially reverted,
displaying hyperacetylation, presence of p300 and reduced
HDAC2 occupancy. Whether this effect is intrinsically
correlated with the overexpression of HDAC2 in cancer,
leading to an aberrant alteration of immune response
or, conversely, is also present in normal cells in specific
settings, remains to be determined. This is by no means a
trivial question. One possible scenario is that cancer cells
might ‘learn’ from normal cells, mimicking a normal and
likely transitory repressive regulation possibly exerted by
HDAC2 on its MHC targets during the life span of normal
cells. HDAC2 overexpression may therefore play a crucial
role in tumor immune escape. It is tempting to speculate
that HDAC2 (and possibly other HDACs) may act as a
connecting bridge between immune response modulation
and cancer development. If this was the case, an opposite
regulation should also apply to autoimmune disorders.
Lastly, it has also been proposed that HDACi modulate
MHC class I and II genes, and that this action may
intrinsically contribute to their anticancer properties [34].
The hypothesis that the effect of HDACi against cancer
rely on unimpaired immune capabilities, together with
our findings that HDAC2 overexpression in AML leads
to repression of MHC class II genes, strongly indicates
that levels of HDACs and in particular of HDAC2 might
impact on HDACi response in vivo and should be taken
into consideration as a cause of possible resistance.
Immune stimulatory approaches might be beneficial in
these settings.

supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone Laboratories),
100 μg/mL penicillin-streptomycin solution (EuroClone),
2 mM L-glutamine (EuroClone), 250 mg/mL amphotericin
B (EuroClone) and 0.5 mg/mL puromycin (Invitrogen) in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.

Drugs
MS-275 (Bayer-Schering AG) and SAHA (Merck)
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and used at
the final concentration of 5 μM.

Cell proliferation analysis with trypan blue
The analysis was performed using colorimetric
method. The cells (2 x 105 cells/mL) were plated in 6-well
multi-wells in triplicate. Following stimulation at different
times and concentrations (as indicated), cells were then
diluted 1:1 in trypan blue (Sigma) and counted by light
microscopy to distinguish dead cells (blue) from living
cells, which do not stain.

Colony forming cell assay
Supernatants in three protocols were centrifuged and
re-suspended in RPMI with 10% FBS at a concentration
of 5 × 105 cells per mL. Subsequently, 0.3 mL of this
cell suspension was added to 3 mL Metho-Cult (H4535,
STEMCELL Technologies), followed by vortexing to mix
thoroughly. Mixture was then kept still for 2-5 min before
1.1 mL was added to each of two or three 35 mm dishes.
All cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2, with ≥95%
humidity for 14 to 18 days.

Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested, washed by PBS with 1% BSA,
incubated with 10μL of monoclonal anti-HLA-DR-DPFITC antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for
30 min as previous described. Cells were fixed by PBS
with 2% paraformaldehyde and then analysed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) with the
Cellquest software (BD Biosciences).

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell culture
U937 cells were obtained from ATCC. The
cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium (SigmaAldrich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone Laboratories), 100 units/
mL penicillin G (EuroClone), 100 μg/mL streptomycin
(EuroClone), 2 mM L-glutamine (EuroClone), 250 mg/
mL amphotericin B (EuroClone) and 50 mg/mL G-418
sulfate (Invitrogen). The estrogen-independent MDAMB231 human breast cancer cell line was cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Real-time cell proliferation
Tumor cell proliferation was monitored with the
xCELLigence system (Roche). MDA-MB231 cells were
suspended in DMEM and added to a 96-well microtiter
plate that is specifically designed to measure cellular
impedance (E-Plate, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The
measured impedance, which is dependent on the level
of confluence, was expressed as an arbitrary unit called
896

Oncotarget

Cell Index (CI). The Cell Index at each time point is
defined as (Rn-Rb)/(15X), where Rn is the cell-electrode
impedance of the well when it contains cells and Rb is
the background impedance of the well with the medium
alone. xCELLigence monitors cellular events in real time
measuring electrical impedance across inter-digitized
micro-electrodes integrated on the bottom of tissue
culture E-Plates. The impedance measurement provides
quantitative information about the biological status of the
cells, including cell number, viability and morphology. A
dimensionless parameter called Cell Index (CI) is derived
as a relative change in measured electrical impedance to
reflect the integrated cellular status in the culture. For
experiments, both scramble (scr) MDA-MB231 clone,
containing the empty vector, and the sh2 clone were
starved in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS overnight
before being seeded on an E-Plate 96. Two hours after
seeding, scalar cell concentrations were added in triplicate.
Dynamic CI values were monitored at 30-minute intervals
from the time of plating until the end of the experiment. CI
values were calculated and plotted on the graph. Standard
deviation of tetraplicate wells for the two cells types with
different treatments were analyzed using RTCA Software.

time monitoring and low and high seeding densities were
quantitatively monitored and reflected by the CI values.

RNA extraction
RNA extraction was performed using RNasefree material and solutions prepared with diethyl
pyrocarbonate (DEPC) (Sigma) to prevent RNA
degradation by ribonuclease. Cell lysis was obtained
by TRIzol method (Invitrogen) using 1 mL TRIzol/107
cells, according to protocol. After centrifugation at
12000 rpm for 15 minutes, Bromo-1-chloro-3-propane
was added at a ratio of 1:10 with TRIzol. Once RNA
was recovered, it was precipitated in isopropanol at
-80°C for 30 minutes. The RNA samples were then
centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes and washed in
cold 75% ethanol. Finally, they were dried at 42°C and
suspended in DEPC H2O. For mRNA expression, total
RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using SuperScript
VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Primers used for qRT-PCR
and semi-quantitative PCR analysis were: HDAC2 FW:

GAPDH REV: 5-GCTGGATGGAATGAAAGG-3’

Cell migration assay
Kinetic information about cell migration was
obtained in real time without exogenous labels using
the Roche xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analyzer
(RTCA) DP instrument. The RTCA DP instrument uses
the CIM (cellular invasion/migration)-Plate 16 featuring
microelectronic sensors integrated into the underside of the
micro-porous polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane
of a Boyden-like chamber. In this way cells migrate from
the upper chamber through the membrane into the bottom
chamber in response to the chemo-attractant (FBS) thus
contacting and adhering to the electronic sensors on the
underside of the membrane, resulting in an increase in
impedance. The impedance increase is proportional to
increasing numbers of migrated cells on the underside of
the membrane. Moreover, CI values reflecting impedance
changes are recorded by the RTCA DP instrument.
Serum-free medium was placed in the top chamber to
hydrate and pre-incubate the membrane for one hour in
the CO2 incubator at 37°C before obtaining a background
measurement. MDA-MB231 cells were re-suspended at
the indicated concentration in serum-free medium. Once
the CIM-Plate equilibrated, it was placed in the RTCA
DP station and the background cell index values were
measured. The CIM-Plate was then removed from the
RTCA DP station and cells were added to the top chamber
at the desired concentration. The CIM-Plate was placed in
the RTCA DP station and migration was monitored every
two minutes for several hours. MDA-MB 231 cells were
analyzed in absence or presence of 10% FBS in the bottom
chamber. Cell migration was detected by automated realwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blot analysis
After removal of the culture medium, the cells
were washed with cold 1X PBS and were lysed using a
lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl,
1% NP40, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 40 mg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), 20 g/mL aprotinin, 20 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/
mL antipain, 10 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mg/
mL pepstatin A and 20 nM okadaic acid. Cells were then
centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C, and
protein content of supernatant was used to determine
the protein concentration by colorimetric assay (Biorad,
Italy). Cell extracts were diluted 1:1 in sample buffer 2X
Laemmli (0.217 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 52.17% SDS, 17.4%
glycerol, 0.026% bromo-phenol blue, 8.7% beta-mercaptoethanol), and then boiled for 3 minutes. Equal amounts of
protein (50 μg) were run and separated by SDS-PAGE gel

Histone extraction

Generation of HDAC2 catalytic inactive mutants
and HDAC2 rescue in sh2 cells

Cells were harvested and washed twice with cold
1X PBS and lysed in Triton extraction buffer (TEB: PBS
containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v), 2 mM PMSF, 0.02%
(w/v) NaN3) at a cellular density of 107 cells per mL
for 10 minutes on ice, with gentle stirring. After a brief
centrifugation at 2000 rpm at 4°C, the supernatant was
removed and the pellet was washed in half the volume of
TEB and centrifuged as before. The pellet was suspended
in 0.2 M HCl at a cell density of 4 × 107 cells per mL and
acid extraction was left to proceed overnight at 4°C on a
rolling table. Next, the samples were centrifuged at 2000
rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, the supernatant was removed
and protein content was determined using the Bradford
assay. Antibodies against acetylated histones H3 and H4
and all hyperacetylated forms (Upstate Biotechnologies)
at concentrations of 2 mg/mL were used.

HDAC2 expression vector was constructed
by cloning the HDAC2 cDNA into a pcDNA 3.1/
V5-His A vector (Invitrogen). HDAC2 sequence
used in the rescue experiments was the following:
ATCAACCCAGCGCTGTTGTTTTACAG. In addition,
rescued-HDAC2 catalytic mutants expressing HDAC2A100
[35], HDAC2D142, HDAC2R11 were generated by using the
QuickChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit
(Stratagene) according to the manufacturers’ protocol.
Transfections of sh2 clones with rescued and HDAC2
mutants, were performed as previously described.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
U937 cells were diluted to a concentration of 2 × 105
cells/mL the day before the experiment (usually 50 mL per
flask). Cells were then cooled by placing the flask in ice.
Crosslinking was performed at room temperature for 10
minutes by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration
of 1%. The action of formaldehyde was neutralized by
adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM. Cell
suspension was then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5-10
minutes (working on ice with cold buffers and protease
inhibitors). The cell sediment (pellet) was suspended in 1X
PBS. Subsequently, cells were suspended in lysis buffer
(approximately 20 mL per 5 × 106 cells) and placed on
a shaker at 4ºC for 10 minutes. Another centrifugation
was performed to collect the nuclei. Immediately after
the preparation of cells, or after thawing, the pellet was
suspended in RIPA buffer, again in ice, at a concentration
of 20 or 25 × 106 cells in 500 μL of equivalent volume.
The nuclei were sonicated at maximum intensity. After
sonication, samples were centrifuged at 13000 rpm
for 20 minutes at 4ºC. The supernatant was the extract
purified and used for ChIP assay analysis. Before the
sample was incubated with antibody, 10% of the sample
was taken as an input indicator for further PCR analysis.
The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube where
the antibody was also added (about 3 μg per reaction).
Immunoprecipitation was continued overnight at 4ºC
with shaking and by adding 40 μL of salmon sperm
DNA/Protein A agarose/BSA. The following day, the
fragments were recovered by centrifugation at 1200
rpm for 5 minutes at 4ºC. The supernatant was removed
with a first wash. Depending on antibody used, several
washes of 3-5 minutes at 4ºC, using 500 μL of each wash
buffer, were then performed. After the final wash, most

MDA-MB231 cells
Silencing of HDAC2 was performed using the Sure
Silencing™ sh2 plasmid vector (SuperArray Bioscience
Corporation for U937 and Sigma for MDA-MB231).
We tested four different sh2 nucleotide sequences able
to recognize the mRNA coding for HDAC2 and induce
gene silencing. The sequences were first submitted to a
search by BLAST algorithm against the entire human
genome sequence to ensure that only the gene of interest
was recognized and silenced. In stable transfection
experiments U937 cells were used at a concentration of 1
x 106 per mL and were stably transfected by nucleofection
using the Amaxa® Cell line Nucleofector® (Kit C for
U937 cells, ATCC; Kit V for MDA-MB231 cells, ATCC).
A suspension of 1 x 106 U937 cells was pelleted at 700
rpm for 7 minutes, and all the medium was removed.
A 12-multiwell plate with 1 mL RPMI culture medium
supplemented with 10% FBS to each well was prepared
and placed in the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. A
mixture of 90 μL Nucleofector Solution and 20 μL
Supplement for each test point was prepared. Finally, 1 μg
of the sh2 vector, 1 μg of the empty vector, consisting of
the negative control vector without insert for sh2 and the
positive control pmax-GFP, were added at each test point.
The samples were introduced into cuvettes, placed in the
electroporator and pulsed with the optimized program
for U937 cells. After electroporation, 500 microliters of
RPMI with 10% FBS were added to each sample, which
was then transferred to the previously prepared multiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the liquid from the debris was removed and 250 μL
of elution buffer was added. Elution was carried out
for 30 minutes at room temperature with agitation. The
fragments were sedimented and the supernatant was put
into a new tube. In addition, 500 μL of elution buffer was
added to the frozen input sample. Subsequently, 20 μL
of 5 M NaCl was added to 500 μL of the sample. Decrosslinking was continued from 4 hours to overnight at
65ºC. Proteins were degraded by treatment with proteinase
K, performed by incubating proteins with 10 μL 0.5 M
ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid, 20 μL 1 M Tris pH 6.5
and 2 μL proteinase K for 1 hour at 45ºC. DNA was then
recovered with phenol/chloroform, chloroform extraction
and ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellet was suspended
in 30-40 μL of Milli-Q water. Real-time PCR analysis
was then performed on these samples. The antibodies
used for this assay were p300, HDAC2 (Abcam),
acH4K16 (Abcam) and acH3K9K14 (Diagenode). The

Microarray analysis

Authorship contribution

Microarray quality control reports generated by the
Agilent Feature Extraction software were used to detect
hybridization artifacts. Probe level raw intensity data were
processed using R/Bio-Conductor [36] and Limma [37]
packages. Background correction was performed using
Limma’s normexp method and data normalization was
carried out in two steps: within-array loess normalization
to correct systematic dye-bias and between-array quantile
normalization to detect systematic non-biological bias.
Ratios representing relative target mRNA intensities
compared to control RNA probe signals were derived from
normalized data. Differentially expressed genes between
conditions (sh2 vs scr) were identified using a paired
Bayesian T-test [38]. For each p-value, the BenjaminiHochberg procedure was used to calculate the false
discovery rate (FDR) in order to avoid the problem of
multiple testing. The selected gene list was obtained using
the following thresholds: FDR <0.01 and fold change >2.
The relative abundance of biological processes based on
Gene Ontology terms in each of the selected lists was
analyzed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization
