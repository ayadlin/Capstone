ABSTRACT
Usage of combination therapies to deliver multiple therapeutics to increase
treatment efficacy has shown promising results in the clinic. In an effort to maximize
the synergistic effect of co-delivery of a drug and siRNA, we have developed a timedependent sequential drug delivery system (DDS) based on a disulfide-linked chitosanbased nanocarrier (CS-ss-SA) for the co-delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) and Bcl-2 specific
siRNA (siBcl-2). This CS-ss-SA nanocarrier is able to transport both drug and siRNA
by entrapment of PTX and adsorption of siRNA on the shell by electrostatic attraction.
We show that this nanocarrier transports siRNA into tumor cells via its glycolipidlike spatial structure and releases a hydrophobic model drug, Nile Red 8-11 h later.
Next, when siRNA and the hydrophobic drug PTX were co-delivered to tumor cells, a
synergistic effect was observed in both cell cycle arrest and cell viability. Ultimately,
the co-delivery of PTX and siBcl-2 by CS-ss-SA may prove to be more efficacious and
may even help overcome drug resistance.

the system, which is a key factor to achieve the best
synergistic outcome is not well understood. The ideal codelivery carrier with an optimized drug releasing sequence
should first release the siRNA to achieve knock-down of
the target gene, leading to a transient window of increased
cytotoxin sensitivity. The ideal co-delivery carrier would
only then release the cytotoxin, for maximum efficacy [11,
12].
According to these principles, we proposed a
disulfide-linked glycolipid-like nanocarrier (chitosanSS-stearic amine, CS-ss-SA) as the co-delivery system.
Chitosan, with a positive zeta potential has been
demonstrated to compact oligonucleotides readily on
its shell [13]. With the particular spatial structure of the
glycolipid-like nanocarrier, hydrophobic drugs can be
easily encapsulated in their inner cores, which makes it
possible to deliver both nucleotide and small molecule
drugs in one regimen [14, 15]. With the selective redox
responsive disulfide linker, the shell will be detached
upon internalization, releasing the compacted siRNA.
Subsequently, the cytotoxin will gradually release from

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, advances in nanotechnology
and biotechnology have opened up unprecedented
opportunities for controlled drug delivery and novel codelivery strategies [1, 2]. With a rational design, a drug
combination with different therapeutic agents in the same
delivery system can allow significant benefits in cancer
therapy, including reduced therapeutic doses, side effects,
development of drug-resistance and, in the long run, cost
[3–6]. In particular, through gene silencing, a window can
open where the tumor cells are transiently sensitized to
a cytotoxin. Therefore, sequential delivery of siRNA and
a conventional cytotoxin in a single nanocarrier offers
considerable potential for improving therapeutic outcomes
[7–10].
However, it should be noted that the
chemotherapeutics and RNAi combination therapy still
faces significant challenges to fulfill potential clinical
applications. First, the optimized timing/sequence

Therefore, this nanocarrier would allow for the sequential
delivery of therapeutic agents.
In this manuscript, we report the development of a
glycolipid-like nanocarrier based on chitosan (CS-ss-SA)
for the co-delivery of a Bcl-2 specific siRNA (siBcl-2)
and the hydrophobic antitumor drug paclitaxel (PTX). We
studied the cellular pathway of the co-delivery system,
including internalization, endo-lysosome escape and
sequential drug release against the MCF-7 breast cancer
cell line. Then we investigated cell cycle arrest and loss
of cell viability induced by the co-delivery of PTX and
siBcl-2 to normal and multi-drug resistant MCF-7 cell
lines. We demonstrate time dependent sequential drug
delivery achieves synergetic effects and potentially can be
used to treat drug resistant cell lines (Scheme 1).

molecular weight of the final polymer as approximately
18.9 KDa.
To prepare the disulfide-linked glycolipid-like
co-delivery complexes, first, paclitaxel was loaded into
Chitosan-SS-steraic acid (CS-ss-SA) with approximately
80% loading efficiency. Next, siRNA was electrostatically
bound to the positive amine groups on the chitosan shell
of the drug-loaded nanoparticles. The hydrodynamic
size of the co-delivery core/shell nanoparticles was
measured to be 160.0 ±37.0 nm by DLS (Figure 1a)
and the size measured by TEM was approximately 140
nm (Figure 1b), which showed increased particle size
than only drug-loaded nanoparticles (Figure S1). The
zeta potential of the co-delivery complexes was 15.6 ±
2.8 mV (Figure 1c), which was lower than that of only
drug-loaded nanoparticles (33.9 ± 1.3 mV) because of the
incorporation of negatively charged siRNA on the shell.
The binding ability of the complexes was assessed using
a gel retardation assay (Figure 1d). When the N/P ratio
of complexes reached 75, the migration of siRNA was
completely retarded, suggesting that stable complexes
were formed when the N/P ratio was at or above 75. Since
siRNA is readily enzymatically degraded by RNases, a
critical advantage of nanocarrier-mediated delivery is the
ability to prevent premature destruction of siRNA [14]. In
order to assess the capacity of CS-ss-SA to protect siRNA
from degradation by RNases, CS-ss-SA/siRNA complexes

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Preparation and characterization of co-delivery
core/shell complexes
The nano-carrier CS-ss-SA was prepared using a
previously reported procedure [16]. SA was crosslinked
with chitosan by a two-step amide coupling to produce
CS-ss-SA. The amino substitution ratio (SD%) was
determined as 9.57% (molar ratio), which provided the

were prepared with N/P ratios = 75 and incubated with a
solution of RNase A. Degradation of siRNA was visualized
via gel electrophoresis and the results are presented in
Figure S2. Free siRNA was completely digested with no
full-length band observed, while clear migration of the
full-length siRNA band was observed even after RNase
treatment. These results indicate that CS-ss-SA is able to
effectively protect siRNA from RNase degradation.

were incubated in non-reducing and reducing (10 mM
GSH) environments. As shown in Figure S3, fluorescence
intensity (I) and FAM-siRNA concentrations (C) showed a
linear regression: I = 37.08 × C – 0.62, r2 = 0.9995, which
confirmed to be 0.165–13.2 μg/mL. The disassociation of
the siRNA from the CS-ss-SA/FAM-siRNA complex was
fairly rapid with a cumulative release of 78.2% in 8 h,
when in the presence of 10 mM GSH. While in the GSHfree release medium, siRNA release rate was relatively
slow in which the cumulative release was less than 50%
at 12h. The difference in release rates is most likely due
to the weakening of the electrostatic interactions between
chitosan and siRNA upon reduction of the nanoparticle
chemical backbone.

In vitro siRNA release
In order to release the siRNA from the chitosan
shell, the disulfide bonds must be reduced to free thiols,
which disrupt the overall structure of the DDS. In order
to tune the sensitivity of the disulfide reduction such
that the siRNA is not prematurely released before the
DDS reaches its target, the structural characteristics of
the DDS were modified. In previous studies, we have
prepared CS-ss-SA with a range of graft ratios [16]. We
found that the introduction of additional disulfide linkers
decreased the sensitivity to cleavage in higher reducing
environments. Using this rational design strategy, CS-ssSA could degrade correspondingly to different levels of
reducing environment, release the payloads, and be used
for triggered-release in different tumor types. In this study,
we used the optimal ratio of disulfide linkers to construct
the CS-ssSA20% which should only release their siRNA
cargo in highly reducing environments. To determine the
rate of release, fluorescently labeled siRNA was adsorbed
onto CS-ss-SA20% nanoparticles. These nanoparticles

Cellular uptake and endo-lysosome escape
To track complexes after cellular uptake and
to evaluate their endo-lysosome escape capacity, the
intracellular distribution of CS-ss-SA/siRNA complexes
in MCF-7 cells was investigated by confocal laser
scanning microscopy (CLSM) (Figure 2). Co-localization
of the fluorescent FAM-siRNA (green) with Lysotrackerstained lysosomes (blue) produced cyan fluorescence in
the merged images. At 1h, large numbers of cyan pixels
were observed in treated cells with 82.4% of siRNA colocalized with lysosomes. This result indicates the CSss-SA/siRNA complexes were trapped in the lysosomes.
After 4 h, fewer cyan pixels were observed. After 12 h,
only 8.03% of siRNA was co-localized with lysosomes,

suggesting that most of the complexes have escaped.
These observations may be due to the ionization state
of chitosan at tumor acidic endo-lysosome environment
(pH 4.5 – 6.4), which is near its pKa (5–7 for chitosan
and independent on the degree of ionization), which may
increase endosomal pH leading to endosomal release [13,
21].

and untreated MCF-7 cells were used as a control [22].
RITC-CS-ss-SA/FAM-siRNA complexes were incubated
with BSO pre-treated or untreated cells. FRETeff (%)
between the donor and acceptor as a function of time
is shown in Figure 3. When the receptor (RITC) was
bleached in the region, fluorescence intensity of the donor
(FAM, green) rapidly increased, indicating significant
FRET between the two fluorophores (Figure 3a). As
seen in Figure 3b, after 1 h of incubation, the different
GSH concentrations made no significant difference in the
FRETeff of the MCF-7 cells. In 2 h, the FRETeff of untreated
MCF-7 cells decreased significantly (p = 0.032). After 12
h of incubation, the FRETeff of untreated MCF-7 cells
decreased even further to below 30%, indicating siRNA
release from the complexes during the 12 h. Whereas
the FRETeff of BSO pre-treated cells maintained a high
percentage (~50%), which illustrated that the release of
siRNA from the complexes was significantly slower with
a lower GSH concentration in the BSO pre-treated cells.
Molecular beacon (MB) is a dual-labeled hairpin
oligonucleotide probe comprising a fluorophore and a
quencher at opposite ends. With the stem-loop structure,
the fluorescence of the fluorophore remains quenched
in the absence of a complementary target. When the

Intracellular triggered siRNA release
To further characterize the intracellular siRNA
release, a FRET assay and molecular beacons (MB)
were applied. Real-time monitoring of redox-responsive
complexes in the presence of high/low levels of GSH in
MCF-7 cells was enabled.
In this study, non-coding siRNA labeled with FAM
(FAM-siNC, Ex=487 nm) and the cationic vector CS-ssSA labelled with RITC (RITC-CS-ss-SA, Ex=546 nm)
were used as the FRET donor and receptor, respectively.
These two dyes were chosen because of their superior
photostability, large spectrum overlaps and high FRET
efficiency.
Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) was added to lower
the intracellular GSH concentration according to literature

molecular beacon hybridizes with its target, the hairpin
structure will open, allowing the fluorescence signal to
be emitted [23, 24]. Based on these principles, a Cy5labeled molecular beacon targeting the human GAPDH
(glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) GAPDHMB (Cy5-MB) was utilized in this study to transduce
the oligonucleotide release from the CS-ss-SA/Cy5-MB
complexes directly into a fluorescence signal by flow
cytometry.
Fluorescence intensity of untreated and BSOpretreated MCF-7 cells as a function of time was shown
in Figure S4. The fluorescence intensity of untreated group
increased gradually over time, which indicated that with
the high GSH concentration in the tumor cells, Cy5-MB
fast released from the CS-ss-SA/Cy5-MB complex, bind
to the target GAPDH sequence, and emitted fluorescence.
Whereas in the BSO-pretreated group, intracellular
fluorescence intensity showed no significant change over
time. The fluorescence intensity of the untreated group
was 39 times higher than that of the BSO-pretreated
group, indicating that the amount of free MB in the BSOpretreated cells dissociated from the complex was only
2.6% of the untreated group.
These results demonstrated that in response to
the high concentration of reducing agents, CS-ss-SA
complexes can readily release the siRNA/oligonucleotides
into tumor cells. When the GSH concentration was
decreased by BSO in the tumor cells, the release rate
significantly decelerates.

significant modifications of the carrier design. We
further studied the intracellular sequential drug delivery
of complexes in MCF-7 cells. Nile red (NR) and FAMlabeled non-coding siRNA (siNC) were used as the model
drugs and fluorescent probes.
NR was chosen for its unique spectral signature,
where the emitted signal is dependent upon the
hydrophobicity of its environment. When NR became
trapped inside the nanoparticle, its fluorescence intensity
at this wavelength essentially disappeared (Figure S5).
The cells underwent incubation with CS-ss-SA/
NR/FAM-siNC complexes for periods of 1, 4, 8, and 12
h respectively and intracellular fluorescence images were
observed to monitor the drug delivery behavior. As shown
in Figure 4, large numbers of green fluorescent bodies
(FAM-siNC) were observed in the first hour, indicating
the complexes first released the siRNA cargo nearly
immediately after cellular internalization. The majority of
visible red fluorescent bodies (NR) started to appear after
the 8 h timepoint, which shows the distinctly different
release kinetics of the two cargoes with the NR clearly
being released 7 to 11 hours later than the siRNA.

In vitro siRNA transfection
MCF-7 cells were incubated with CS-ss-SA/siBcl-2
complexes for 24 h and then intracellular Bcl-2 mRNA
levels were determined by RT-PCR. After sequencespecific Bcl-2 silencing by CS-ss-SA/siBcl-2 complexes,
reduced Bcl-2 mRNA levels were observed (Figure 5a).
Elevated siBcl-2 concentrations produced increased gene
knockdown, with 50, 100 and 200 nM of siBcl-2 by CSss-SA/siBcl-2 complexes inducing 79.4%, 85.8% and
93.1% knockdown of Bcl-2 mRNA. In comparison, the
negative control showed neglible knockdown efficiency.
Transfection using the CS-ss-SA/siBcl-2 complexes is
similar to that of the Lipofectamine2000 transfection reagent

Intracellular sequential drug delivery
The biggest challenge in co-delivery is to find
applicable carriers to optimize the timing/location of
release of chemotherapy and siRNA agents in tumor cells.
The incorporation of additional drug payloads affects
the pharmacokinetics of the nanocarrier and requires

highly effective.

Simply knocking down Bcl-2 has not been found to
effectively suppress cancer activity, most likely due to the
complexity of the apoptotic signaling pathway [26–29].
According to the mechanism of drug action, the silencing
of the Bcl-2 gene will open a window of time in which
the cell population’s cell cycle is transiently synchronized,
becoming more sensitive to chemotherapy [11, 30]. As

one of the most frequently used drugs in the treatment of
breast cancer, dose-dependent side effect of PTX greatly
limits its clinical application [31]. Thus, reducing the
PTX dose or increasing the sensitivity of tumor cells is of
particular importance. PTX interferes with mitotic spindle
function through tubulin polymerization and arrests the
G2/M phase of cell cycle.
In this study, CS-ss-SA/siBcl-2/PTX complexes
were incubated with MCF-7 cells and multi-drug resistant
MCF-7/Adr cells, which introduced G2/M cell-cycle arrest
after 48 h (Figure 5b). In MCF-7 cells, G2/M population
gradually increased from 10.0% to 21.5%, indicating
that PTX-loaded CS-ss-SA nanoparticles release PTX.
Whereas after incubation with CS-ss-SA/siBcl-2/PTX
complexes, the G2/M population increased significantly
to 67.3%, indicating that co-delivery of siBcl-2 and
PTX was more efficacious. A similar tendency was also
seen in MCF-7/Adr cells, indicating the possibility of
the synergetic effect induced by the co-delivery system
against both drug-sensitive and resistant cells.

the drug resistance of MCF-7 and MCF-7/Adr cells.
The experiments were designed to gain insight into the
quantitative measurement of Bcl-2 silencing and PTX to
exert their maximum effect. As shown in the Figure 6a-6c,
CS-ss-SA micelles exhibited negligible toxicity in MCF7 cells, while CS-ss-SA/siBcl-2/PTX complexes showed
a high cytotoxicity (74.9%). The co-delivery CS-ss-SA/
siBcl-2/PTX complexes presented significantly higher
cytotoxicity than that of CS-ss-SA/PTX nanoparticle
(39.1%, p = 0.0023) or CS-ss-SA/siBcl-2 complexes
(28.6%, p = 0.0082) alone. Since the concentration of PTX
in the experiment was 0.1 μg/mL, the greatly increased
cytotoxicity was possibly attributed to the synergistic
effect of PTX and silencing of Bcl-2 gene.
To further confirm the synergistic assumption
of the co-delivery system, we used the the ChouTalalay combination index (CI) method to quantitate
the synergistic effect [32]. A free computer software
“Calcusyn” provided by Prof. Chou was used for data
analysis. The software generated the simulation and
provided PD parameters (Dm and m), curves for doseeffect, the Fa-CI and median effect plot, and the Summary

In this study, calculated CI values were established
for doses providing a 50, 75, and 90% cancer cell-killing
effect (ED50, ED75 and ED90). The results for ED90 revealed
that co-delivery of PTX and siBcl-2 with all doses had
CI values between 0.29 to 0.03, indicating a strong
synergistic effect (Figure 6c). For the drug resistant MCF7/Adr cells, the CI values ranged from 0.31 to 0.10, also
indicating a significant synergism (Figure 6f). Based on
these results, we conclude that the co-delivery complexes
had synergistic effects, and showed the capacity of
overcoming multi-drug resistance.
Interestingly, the co-delivery system showed
higher cell growth inhibition than that of the mixture of
PTX-loaded nanoparticles and siRNA-bound complexes
administered at the same dose. Reports have shown that
siRNA and chemotherapeutic agents co-delivered in the
same carrier system had a greater inhibitory effect on cell
proliferation than delivered separately in different carriers
[33–35]. This is mainly because the same drug delivery
system with chemotherapeutics and siRNA guaranteed
similar cell internalization and intracellular sequential
drug release for both treatments in the tumor cells. For
long-term consideration, a co-delivery system with the
same carrier could guarantee similar pharmacokinetics
and concomitant passive accumulation of both treatments
in the same tissue and cells [1, 36].

Synthesis of CS-ss-SA

CONCLUSION

The CS-ss-SA was synthesized according
to a literature method [16]. SA was conjugated
with 3, 3’ -dithiodipropionic acid mediated by
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) / dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP) in a molar ratio of 1:1. The reaction was
performed at 60 °C for 24 h under an atmosphere
of N2 and filtered to remove the byproducts. The
intermediate product was activated by 1-ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and added
to the chitosan aqueous solution. Anhydrous DMSO
was added (DMSO: H2O=8:5, molar ratio) to avoid
precipitation. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C for the next
8 h and dialyzed against DI water for 48 h and centrifuged.
The supernatant was lyophilized and rinsed using hot
ethanol to remove the unreacted reagent. The product (CSss-SA) was re-dispersed in DI water and lyophilized.

In conclusion, we have designed and applied
an effective co-delivery nanocarrier for an optimized
synergetic effect. Significantly, the release of siRNA
was correlated positively with the intracellular GSH
level. SiRNA and a hydrophobic drug were sequentially
delivered into cells by a nanocarrier and generated cell
cycle arrest and cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells and
drug-resistant cells. This co-delivery system will facilitate
the rational design of a sequential combined therapy.

Intracellular triggered siRNA release

CS-ss-SA was dissolved in DI water and PTX/
ethanol solution was added (20%, w/w) dropwise with
constant stirring for 20 min. The mixed solution was
dialyzed against DI water overnight (MWCO = 7000 Da)
and the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min
to remove the unloaded PTX. The resulting supernatant
was lyophilized and PTX loaded CS-ss-SA was obtained.
The amount of PTX inside the cores was determined by a
HPLC assay [17].

A förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay
was used to monitor the assembled structure and release
dynamics of the complexes [18]. RITC-labeled CS-ss-SA
solution was typically added to the FAM-siRNA solution
at the desired N/P ratios to form FRET complexes. MCF7 cells were seeded into 12-well plates containing cover
slips at a density of 5×104 cells per well. After 24 h of
plating, FRET complexes (100 μL) were added. After
incubation for 1, 2, 4, and 12 h, cells were rinsed with
fresh PBS and fixed with 4% PFA. FRET images of
complexes were visualized by confocal microscopy
(Nikon A1). An acceptor bleaching (AB) method was used
to measure FRET efficiency by bleaching the acceptor and
calculate the enhancement of the donor fluorescence [19].
The energy transfer efficiency (FRETeff) was quantified as:

Consider that molecular beacon (MB) has a unique
stem–loop configuration combined with fluorophore
and quencher [20], we applied a Cy5-labeled GAPDHMB (Cy5-GAPDH-MB) as the oligonucleotide release
indicator. CS-ss-SA/Cy5-GAPDH-MB complex was
prepared by a similar method to the CS-ss-SA/siRNA
complex. MCF-7 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at
a density of 2×105 cells per well. After 24 h of plating,
CS-ss-SA/Cy5-GAPDH-MB complex were added.
After incubation for 1, 2, 4, and 12 h, cells were rinsed
with fresh PBS, collected and fixed with 4% PFA. After
centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and wash
with PBS twice, the cells were re-suspended in 0.5 mL of
buffer. Flow cytometry (FC500MCL, Beckman Coulter)
was used to measure the fluorescence intensity.

were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel
containing ethidium bromide, using E-Gel electrophoresis
system (Invitrogen) and visualized under UV light.

RNase protection assay
CS-ss-SA/siRNA complexes (containing 1 μg
siRNA) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature,
followed by the addition of RNase A (10 U). As a control,
free siRNA (1 μg) was also treated with RNase I under
the same condition. After 30 min incubation, the samples
were further treated with RNase inhibitor (RI, 1 μL= 40
U) and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C to terminate the
activation of RNase A, followed the addition of heparin
(0.05%) incubated for 30 min. The integrity of siRNA was
determined by gel electrophoresis at the same conditions
as described before.

Intracellular sequential drug delivery trafficking
The fluorescence probe Nile red (NR) was utilized
as the hydrophobic model drug and encapsulated in the
CS-ss-SA/FAM-siNC complexes in accordance with the
protocol. MCF-7 cells were seeded into 6-well plates
containing cover slips at a density of 3×104 cells per well.
After 24 h of plating, sequence-release complexes (CSss-SA/FAM-siRNA/NR) were added. After incubation for
4h, the medium was withdrawn and replaced with fresh
medium. After 1, 4, 8, and 12 h, cells were rinsed with
fresh PBS and fixed with 4% PFA. Fluorescence images
of complexes were visualized by structured illumination
microscopy (SIM).

Cell uptake and endo-lysosome escape studies
The in vitro cell uptake and endo-lysosome escape
of CS-ss-SA/siRNA complexes was determined by
confocal studies. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to uptake in
12-well plates containing cover slips at a density of 5×104
cells per well. CS-ss-SA/siRNA complexes were added to
yield a final siRNA concentration of 100 nM. FAM-labeled
siRNA (FAM-siRNA) was used as the model drug. After
1, 4, and 12 h of incubation, the media were replaced and
stained with Lyso-tracker. Cells were subsequently rinsed
with fresh PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). The green fluorescence of complexes and blue
fluorescence of endo-lysosome were visualized with the
confocal microscope (Olympus IX81-FV1000).

Bcl-2 silencing
For gene silencing, MCF-7 cells were seeded into
6-well plates at a density of 3×105 cells per well. After 24
h of plating, cells were incubated with CS-ss-SA/siBcl-2

complexes with different siBcl-2 concentrations (50, 100,
200 nM). Lipofectamine2000/siBcl-2 (100nM) was used for
control. RNA was extracted with TRIzol according to the
standard protocol and total mRNA concentrations were
detected by the nanodrop spectrophotometer. Reverse
transcription was conducted with PrimeScript™ RT
Reagent Kit (TaKaRa) in a 20 μL SYBR® Green assay.
Real-time PCR (StepOne, Applied Biosystems) was
used to perform the amplification reaction. Bcl-2 primer
sequence was 5’-GGATTGTGGCCTTCTTTGAG-3’ and
the reverse was 5’-TACCCAGCCTCCGTTATCCT-3’.The
protocol was carried out for 40 cycles, comprising 95°C
for 5 s and 60°C for 34 s. GAPDH was also amplified as
an internal control. A ΔΔCT method was used for relative
quantification of the expression levels. Each sample was
performed in triplicate.

Co-delivery complexes (containing 100 nM of
siBcl-2 and 100 ng of PTX) treated MCF-7 and MCF7/ADR cells (2×106 cells/well for 6-well plate) in 10%
serum-containing culture medium were collected 48 h
post-incubation and washed with ice cold PBS. The cells
were fixed by ice cold 70% ethanol over night. After
centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and wash
with PBS twice, the cells were re-suspended in 0.5 mL of
buffer containing RNase A and 50 mg/mL PI. All samples
were measured by Beckman Coulter Cytomics FC-500
and cell cycle distributions were analyzed.

In vitro cytotoxicity of the co-delivery complexes
was evaluated by a cell viability assay. The MCF-7 and
MCF-7/Adr cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a
density of 5×104 cells per well. After 24 h of plating, cells
were incubated with CS-ss-SA/siBcl-2/PTX complexes.
After 48h of incubation, MTT solution (5.0 mg/mL)
was added and incubated for 4 h. The culture medium
was changed to DMSO to dissolve the purple formazan
crystals. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a
micro plate reader. The results indicated the cytotoxicity
of co-delivery complexes was calculated.
