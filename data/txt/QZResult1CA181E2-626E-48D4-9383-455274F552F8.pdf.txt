ABSTRACT
DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that contributes to stable gene
silencing by interfering with the ability of transcriptional regulators to bind to DNA.
Recent findings have revealed that hormone stimulation of certain nuclear receptors
induces rapid, dynamic changes in DNA methylation patterns alongside transcriptional
responses at a subset of target loci, over time. However, the ability of androgen
receptor (AR) to dynamically regulate gene transcription is relatively under-studied
and its role in the regulation of DNA methylation patterns remains to be elucidated.
Here we demonstrate in normal prostate cells that hormone stimulated AR activity
results in dynamic changes in the transcription rate and DNA methylation patterns at
the AR target genes, TIPARP and SGK1. Time-resolved chromatin immunoprecipitation
experiments on the SGK1 locus reveals dynamic recruitment of AR and RNA Polymerase
II, as well as the recruitment of proteins involved in the DNA demethylation process,
TET1 and TDG. Furthermore, the presence of DNA methylation at dynamic regions
inhibits protein binding and transcriptional activity of SGK1. These findings establish
AR activity as a contributing factor to the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation
patterns at target genes in prostate biology and infer further complexity involved in
nuclear receptor mediation of transcriptional regulation.

INTRODUCTION

chromatin remodeling proteins and components of the
basal transcriptional machinery [3].
Early models of transcription illustrated a
mechanism that assumed a static chromatin environment,
wherein promoter DNA regulatory elements served as
stationary platforms to which nuclear receptors and
their respective co-regulators bound as stable protein
complexes, where they initiated and activated gene
transcription [4]. Under this model, it was proposed that
these large protein complexes would remain bound to
the DNA to continuously regulate transcription for long
periods, until stimulus was withdrawn [5]. However,
recent studies have contrasted this model, revealing
that hormone-dependent transcription is a dynamic
signaling process that requires the continuous cyclical
recruitment and sequential release of nuclear receptors
at DNA response elements [6]. This model has been

Androgens are steroid hormones which exert their
biological effects through the androgen receptor, a liganddependent nuclear receptor that binds androgen response
elements (AREs) in the DNA to regulate gene expression
[1]. Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that play
important roles in many physiological processes, which
include but are not limited to metabolism, development,
reproduction and various immune responses [2]. What
sets nuclear receptors apart from other transcription
factors is that they bind directly to specific lipophilic
ligands: steroids, retinoids, thyroid hormones and dietary
lipids. Upon ligand binding, nuclear receptors become
activated and transcriptionally regulate downstream gene
expression pathways by binding to sequence-specific
DNA elements and recruiting co-regulatory proteins,

for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) [7], the estrogen
receptor α (ERα) [8], the vitamin D receptor (VDR) [9,
10], and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) [9]. The dynamic
recruitment of these nuclear receptors to their respective
DNA response elements has been reported to occur in
phase with gene transcription. An in-depth analysis of ERα
binding to the TFF1/pS2 promoter revealed that alongside
the dynamic recruitment of ERα, co-factors and chromatin
modifiers, such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and
histone deacetyltransferases (HDACs), were also recruited
in a similar fashion [8]. Similarly, the androgen receptor
(AR) has also been reported to be dynamically recruited
to targets genes to mediate transcription [11]. However,
these dynamics have only been reported in prostate cancer
cells on the PSA locus, and the relevance of dynamic AR
signaling to normal prostate biology remains unexplored.
Epigenetic DNA modifications are heritable marks
that are required for correct gene expression and for the
compartmentalization of the genome into euchromatic and
heterochromatic regions [12]. When used in many diverse
and complex combinations, these modifications regulate
cell reprogramming and dictate cell fate decisions during
stages of development and differentiation. Additionally,
epigenetic DNA modifications are known to be largely
responsible for dictating chromatin remodeling structures
in order to regulate gene expression profiles.
An important example of an epigenetic modification
is DNA methylation. DNA methylation is a chemical
modification that involves the covalent addition of a
methyl group to the fifth carbon of a cytosine residue
and typically occurs within a CpG dinucleotide context
in adult somatic cells [13]. Not only is DNA methylation
vital for mammalian development and adult homeostasis,
but it is also a central mechanism of epigenetic regulation
in eukaryotic cells [13-15]. DNA methylation controls
important biological functions, such as inactivation of the
X chromosome, genomic imprinting and the regulation
of gene expression [16]. DNA methylation is associated
with stable gene silencing, either through the interference
of transcription factor binding to the DNA or through the
recruitment of several repressor proteins that bind to sites
containing methylated DNA, consequently creating a
repressive transcriptional environment.
While the DNA methyltransferase family of proteins
(DNMTs) has been well-known to catalyze the addition
of a methyl group to the number five carbon in a CpG
dinucleotide [14], it was not until the discovery of the role
of the ten eleven translocation (TET) family of proteins
that the mechanism of DNA demethylation became fully
understood. These studies have shown that the TET
enzymes are able to successively oxidize 5-methylcytosine
to 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine and
5-carboxylcytsonine [17, 18]. Thymine DNA glycosylase
(TDG) recognizes these oxidized bases and excises them,
which paves the way for DNA repair mechanisms to

replace the base with an unmethylated cytosine [18]. These
observations have led to a renewed focus on the dynamics
of DNA methylation in all contexts of cell function.
Many of these studies have focused on comparing global
methylation dynamics that dictate embryonic stem cells
before and after lineage commitment and differentiation
[19]. These cell states are typically differentiated on a
timeline of days to weeks [20]. However, locus-specific
dynamic methylation on the order of minutes remains
largely unexplored. While reports have indicated that
DNA methylation is a dynamic mark that is associated
with ERα signaling in the context of a transcriptional
response [21, 22], a role for dynamic DNA methylation in
relation to androgen receptor (AR) signaling, has not been
investigated to date.
Here we demonstrate that hormone stimulation of
AR leads to dynamic patterns in the transcriptional rate
of AR target genes in normal, non-transformed prostate
epithelial cells. This occurs along with dynamic changes
in the DNA methylation patterns at androgen response
elements (AREs) within these genes. Additionally,
we show that AR, TET1 and TDG are all seen to be
dynamically co-recruited to these regions. These data
establish a central role for the hormonal stimulation of AR
in the regulation of the DNA methylation pattern of AR
target genes, alongside the more elucidated role of AR as
a transcriptional regulator.

RESULTS
HPr1-AR cells are a normal, prostate cell line that
expresses AR and semi-differentiates in response
to DHT
To study the association between androgen receptor
(AR) signaling and DNA methylation patterns in normal
prostate biology, we used the Human Prostate-1 (HPr1)
cell line that stably expresses exogenous AR under
control of the CMV promoter (HPr1-AR) [23]. These
cells constitutively express AR protein in the cytoplasm
but demonstrate nuclear accumulation of AR and
differentiate in response to long term androgen-exposure
[23]. However, their short-term response has not been
characterized. We observed that short-term treatment
with 10 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for as little as 1
h resulted in an increase in nuclear AR localization, as
demonstrated by western blot analysis of nuclear lysates
(Figure 1A, lower panel). As expected, AR protein
expression is completely absent in the parental cell line,
HPr1 (Figure 1A, upper panel). We next investigated
whether HPr1-AR cells differentiated in response to
short-term DHT treatment by measuring the expression
of differentiation cytokeratin markers. A decrease in the
basal marker CK5, paired with a simultaneous increase in

the luminal marker CK8, shows that the HPr1-AR cells
semi-differentiate toward a more luminal-like phenotype
when treated with DHT (Figure 1B, 1D). Additionally, a
significant decrease in the growth rate of the cells after

48 h of DHT treatment was observed (Figure 1C). These
results indicate that the HPr1-AR cells behave similar
under short-term androgen treatment as they do under
long-term treatment [23] and provide an ideal model

Studies of transcriptional dynamics often begin
with extraordinary efforts to synchronize cells such as 72
hours of serum starvation followed by a short treatment
with the RNA polymerase inhibitor α-amanitin to turn off
transcription in all cells. This is followed by washing out

the transcription inhibitor and adding the stimulus. While
this is highly effective at synchronizing transcriptional
response to the stimulus, thereby allowing for detection
of coordinated dynamics, it places the genome in an
artificial basal state that might influence the basal DNA
methylation we want to study. Such an artificial basal
state might then exaggerate or subdue any potential

dynamic changes to methylation in a short time frame.
Omitting synchronization of the cells other than the
addition of ligand (androgen) allowed for detection of
dynamic transcription and DNA methylation in individual
replicates, however there was too much variation in
biological triplicates to be confident of the data (data not
shown). Therefore, we explored alternate methods of cell
population synchronization that relied on growth factor
withdrawal. The growth media for HPr1-AR cells contains
bovine pituitary extract (BPE) that may be a source of
potential hormone that can activate AR. BPE starvation of
the cells reduced basal nuclear AR levels (starved media
condition) in the absence of DHT. Western blot analysis
of nuclear lysates in Figure 2A demonstrated that after 48
h of BPE withdrawal, nuclear AR levels were decreased.
To determine if this method of synchronization
resulted in a robust and consistent transcriptional response
to the addition of DHT, total mRNA levels of target genes
were measured in cells that were either grown in BPEcontaining or BPE-starved media for 48 h, and then treated
with DHT. While the magnitude of the transcriptional
response to the addition of ligand at 2 h and 4 h was
muted in the starved cells compared to the cells grown
in full media, the biological triplicates were far more
consistent with tighter error bars in the BPE-starved cells
(Figure 2B). We determined that the reduction in signal
amplitude was an acceptable trade-off to facilitate our goal
of observing dynamics that were highly consistent across
replicates.

3:00 h (Figure 3B-3C, top graphs). These data establish
that DHT stimulation of AR leads to dynamic transcription
rates of AR target genes.
We used MassARRAY EpiTYPER to quantitate the
methylation status of CpG dinuceotides located near or at
AREs of the TIPARP and SGK1 loci to determine if the
regions displayed changes in DNA methylation in relation
to oscillations in transcription rate over time. Figure 2A
outlines the regions that were interrogated. We observed
methylation oscillations at CpG sites at or near the
AREs in response to DHT treatment. Specifically, DNA
demethylation was observed at ARE II of TIPARP between
1:15 h and 1:45 h after DHT treatment at CpG -643,
which correlates with an increase in the transcriptional
rate (Figure 3B). This is preceded by drops in methylation
levels at CpGs -669, -776, and -890 at the 0:30 and 0:45
time points. Furthermore, when the transcriptional rate
decreases after the 1:45 time point, methylation returns
to CpG -643. Spearman correlation analysis reveals that
CpG sites -643 and -890 negatively correlate significantly
with the transcription rate 15 minutes later (Table 1.1).
This suggests that the methylation status at these sites
may be predictive of the expression pattern of TIPARP.
Interestingly, CpG -669 correlates positively with
transcription rate 15 minutes later.
We further observed dynamic changes in DNA
methylation at the ARE I region of SGK1 at CpG sites
-1024/-1029, -1079, -1118, -1150 and -1228 (Figure 3C).
These dynamic regions are in contrast to CpG sites -933,
-946, -1133 and -1140, which do not exhibit dynamics.
DNA demethylation occurs from 0:30 h to 1:00 h and
also from 2:00 h to 2:45 h at CpG -1079, in phase with
an increase in the transcriptional rate during each time
window (Figure 3C). Similar statistical analysis on the
predictive measure of the methylation on the transcription
rate revealed no significant correlations at any of the
tested CpG sites (data not shown). Statistical analysis on
the change in methylation compared to the change in the
transcription rate also revealed no significant correlations
(Table 1.2). However, it is noteworthy that most of the
CpG sites in the ARE I region of SGK1 have a negative
correlation value in relation to the transcription rate (Table
1.2). These analyses suggest that the regulation at SGK1
may be a more complex mechanism than at TIPARP.
The ARE I region for TIPARP and the ARE II and
TSS (transcription start site) regions for SGK1 did not
show any methylation dynamics at the time points and
conditions used in our study (Supplementary Figure
1). Collectively, these data demonstrate that contextdependent, dynamic DNA methylation occurs at select
AREs in response to androgen stimulation, suggesting a
link between AR signaling and DNA methylation.

Androgen-induced dynamics in transcriptional
output occurs alongside dynamic changes in the
DNA methylation patterns at gene regulatory
elements
To assess the correlation between the transcriptional
rate of AR target genes and their respective DNA
methylation patterns, both RNA and DNA were collected
from the same cell population every 15 min after DHT
treatment over a 4 hour window. All experiments were
performed as biological triplicates and the transcription
rate is represented as fold change over the vehicle control
at each of the 17 time points. We interrogated two AR
target genes, TIPARP (TCDD-Inducible Poly(ADPRibose) Polymerase) and SGK1 (serum/glucocorticoid
regulated kinase 1), which have been reported previously
to be up-regulated upon hormone treatment in HPr1-AR
cells [24]. Nascently transcribed RNA was isolated to
measure the transcription rate of these two genes over
the timeline. As shown in Figure 3B, TIPARP has one
transcription rate peak that occurs between 1:15 h and
1:45 h after DHT treatment and then another peak of
transcriptional activity that begins 4 h after treatment.
SGK1 has two distinct transcription rate peaks that occur
between 0:45 h through 1:45 h and between 2:15 h through

Dynamic recruitment of AR, TDG and TET1 is
observed at the SGK1 ARE I

following 1:30 h of DHT treatment. Analysis of the SGK1
TSS region revealed a similar pattern of AR recruitment.
Similar patterns of dynamic recruitment were also
observed for RNA polymerase II in the first 1:30 h after
DHT treatment (Supplementary Figure 2). Together, these
ChIP data for AR and RNA Pol II demonstrate that both
proteins are dynamically recruited alongside one another
to mediate gene transcription in response to DHT.
DNA demethylation has been attributed to the
function of TET1 and TDG proteins. Therefore, ChIP for

While there was no other observed recruitment of TET1
at other time points, we were able to detect a second cycle
of TDG occupancy at 2:00 h. The recruitment of TET1
and TDG at the 30 minute time point is 30 minutes prior to
the first increase in transcriptional rate, and 15-30 minutes
preceding demethylation that was observed for CpG sites

-1079 and -1288. The recruitment of TDG at the 2:00 time
point precedes a transcriptional rate peak by 30 minutes

Methylation of CpG sites at the SGK1 ARE I
inhibits protein binding and androgen responsive
transcription

protein binding (Figure 5B). Note that despite only having
2 CpG sites in Probe A (-1024 and -1029) and 1 CpG
site in Probe B (-1079), their methylation was sufficient
to greatly inhibit protein binding. This suggests that the
dynamic demethylation of these CpG sites in response to
DHT treatment is likely a prerequisite for the recruitment
of DNA-binding regulatory factors that contribute to the
transcriptional response.
To assess the biological function of methylation of
ARE I of the SGK1 locus, we inserted a 450 bp fragment
containing the ARE I region into the pCpGfree-promoterLucia reporter vector upstream of the hEF1 promoter.
The CpG free nature of this vector allows for artificial
methylation of only the inserted DNA by incubation
with methyltransferases. We created both partially (2 of
12 CpG sites, -1118 and -1140) and fully (12 of 12 CpG
sites) methylated versions of the ARE I region using
HpaII or SssI methylase enzymes, respectively, to test the
effect of DNA methylation on promoter activity. Upon
transfection and treatment with DHT, the unmethylated
vector significantly induced transcriptional activity in
HPr1-AR cells, confirming the androgen responsiveness
of this element (Figure 6). Partial methylation of ARE I
had no effect on androgen response. However, the fully
methylated SGK1 ARE I resulted in a complete block in
androgen responsiveness. These data establish the ARE
I within the SGK1 gene as a positive regulator of SGK1
transcription, with putative enhancer activity. Further, our
findings indicate that methylation of this region, which
displays dynamic DNA methylation changes in response
to androgen treatment, plays an inhibitory role in SGK1
transcription.

We next sought to investigate the significance
of methylation at the CpG positions showing dynamic
responses. We hypothesized that methylation of these
CpGs would prevent the binding of transcriptional
regulatory proteins. We utilized Electromobility Shift
Assays (EMSA) to interrogate protein-DNA binding to
DNA probes that overlapped the AR consensus sequences
and the dynamic CpGs that were observed in the SGK1
ARE I region. Because there were two AR consensus
binding sites in this region, we created two different probes
that covered both of these sequences: one probe (Probe
A, 24 nts in size) that covers CpG sites -1024 and -1029
and a second probe (Probe B, 27 nts in size) that covered
CpG site -1079 (Figure 5A). When we incubated our DNA
probes with DHT-stimulated HPr1-AR nuclear extract, we
observed a shift that indicated binding of protein to both
probes, with clearly strong binding to Probe B. All lanes
included 200x molar excess of non-specific competitor
poly dI:dC to block non-specific interactions. The gel
shift was effectively competed out by the introduction
of a specific competitor, the unlabeled probe (Figure 5B)
at 200x molar excess. These results demonstrate specific
nuclear protein binding to both probes. To determine the
effect that methylation has on protein binding, we used
SssI methylase to generate fully methylated versions of
both probes. Methylation resulted in a lack of gel shift
for both probes indicating that methylation interferes with

DISCUSSION

factor binding and enhancer activity [25, 26, 30]. These
observations have been shown in both mouse and human
cells.
Whether or not AR itself is responsible for dictating
methylation patterns during transcriptional control remains
to be determined; however, the link between androgen
stimulation, selective transient DNA demethylation, and
the recruitment of AR, TET1, and TDG is clear. Previous
reports have linked DNMT3A/3B to the process of DNA
demethylation when interacting with TDG in vitro [22].
TDG is observed to inhibit the methylation activity of
DNMT3A while DNMT3A stimulates the glycosylase
activity of TDG. However, there have been follow up
studies which suggest that the sequential actions of
DNMT-mediated deamination and base excision repair
are not enough to achieve hormone-induced active
DNA demethylation [31]. The discovery of the role
the TET family of proteins in the DNA demethylation
pathway has brought these proteins to the forefront of the
demethylation process. Studies have shown that TET1 has
been found to be associated with promoter regions and
regulatory elements [32]. In line with these observations,
we have found TET1 to be present at the SGK1 ARE I.
This supports the notion that not only is TET1 involved
in DNA demethylation during cell lineage decisions and
development, but also may play a role in the transient
transcriptional response of hormone-inducible genes. The
presence of multiple cycles of TDG association with the
SGK1 ARE I in ChIP assays is consistent with previous
published data that have observed TDG recruitment [22],
and suggests TDG is dynamically recruited to mediate
transcription. Of note is the observation that NCOA3, a
common co-activator of the AR [33], binds TDG [34].
Furthermore, interference with the ability of NCOA3 to
bind TDG decreased the activity of AR signaling. This
supports a central role that AR may play in the temporal
recruitment of a putative protein complex that consists
of the enzymes involved in the DNA demethylation
process to initiate chromatin-remodeling processes for
transcription.
While the broad, inhibitory role that DNA
methylation plays in the regulation of transcription is an
accepted function of the epigenetic mark, the observation
that methylation patterns are dynamically changing to
regulate transcription in lineage committed cells is still
poorly understood. The current study reports for the first
time that hormone stimulation of AR has been linked to
these observations, and as a result, introduces potential
new pathways to consider for AR target gene regulation.
Consistent with published data, the methylation dynamics
that we observe occur at low density CpG regions [22,
25], which may be more likely to be involved in dynamic
gene regulation. Even for the TIPARP region showing
methylation dynamics, which is near the end of a CpG
island, the methylation is very focal with only few
specific CpGs showing methylation dynamics, therefore

The AR signaling axis governs and influences prodifferentiation transcriptional programs in normal prostate
biology. In the current study, we have demonstrated that
DHT stimulation of AR results in dynamic changes in the
DNA methylation patterns at biologically active AREs.
At select CpG sites, this dynamic methylation pattern
occurs inversely in phase with dynamic changes of the
transcriptional rate of target genes. These data show that
dynamic changes in DNA methylation also play a role in
transcriptional regulation. These data correlate with the
already-established dynamic histone modification patterns
that are observed with the recruitment pioneer factors,
nuclear receptors, nuclear receptor co-factors and the
transcriptional machinery, providing evidence that DNA
methylation also plays a dynamic role in the complex
process of transcriptional activation.
The CpG sites, which coordinate most closely with
the transcriptional pattern, are CpG sites that are located
near or within AREs. Notably, there are CpG sites that
surround the AREs that show little or no methylation
dynamics, suggesting that only select CpG may play a role
in transcriptional regulation. Most of the other regions that
did not show dynamics were either completely methylated
or unmethylated across the interrogated region. The TSS
region of SGK1 sits within a CpG island, which was
almost uniformly unmethylated at all CpG positions across
all time points. These observations fit with previously
published data that show regions where dynamics occur
are typically moderately methylated (anywhere from 1050% methylated) and in regions of relatively low density
of CpG [25, 26]. These findings suggest that the selective
methylation dynamics that occur specifically at the lower
CpG density AREs are essential for androgen-dependent
transcriptional activation.
Despite observed methylation dynamics, most
CpG sites not located directly at the AREs do not show
significant correlation between the methylation dynamics
and the transcriptional rate, suggesting that these CpG
sites do not play direct roles in regulation transcription,
but may influence chromatin remodeling, the binding of
other transcription factors, or other processes that may
be prerequisites to initiating or terminating androgendependent transcription. Support for this hypothesis
stems from previous reports which demonstrated that
transcription by nuclear receptors appears to be associated
with dynamic changes in DNA methylation [21, 22, 2729]. When we interrogated ENCODE ChIP-seq data, we
observed a plethora of other TFs that binds near to the
SGK1 ARE I and the TIPARP ARE II (data not shown),
which may explain the observed dynamics at these other
CpG sites. Furthermore, the presence of methylation
dynamics at distal regulatory regions as opposed to
promoter regions is consistent with data that links DNA
hypomethylation at enhancer regions to transcription

limiting the methylation density within the region. This
is in contrast to regions of the genome of high CpG
density, where high level methylation of these regions
are typically associated with stable gene silencing and
heterochromantinization [35]. Aberrant DNA methylation
and heterochromantinization at gene promoters, which
are commonly found to contain high CpG density regions
[15], are known epigenetic hallmarks of cancer. As such,
understanding the importance of DNA methylation in
these contexts in normal biology may shed light on how
DNA methylation patterns become distorted in cancer.

rotation, and then spun down at 12,000 g for 15 min at RT.
A second PCI extraction was performed afterwards. The
upper aqueous phase was retrieved. 20 µl of 3M sodium
acetate (NaOAc) pH 5.2, 2 µl of 1 mg/ml glycogen and
2.5x volumes of 95% cold EtOH was added to precipitate
the DNA. Samples were spun at 13,000 rpm for 15 min
at 4°C. The resulting DNA pellets were then washed with
100 µl of 70% cold EtOH and spun down again at 13,000
rpm for 15 mins at 4°C. DNA was resuspended in 50 µl of
1x TE buffer and stored at 4°C.

Nascent RNA capture

MATERIALS AND METHODS

HPr-1AR cells were treated with 10 nM DHT or
EtOH as a vehicle every 15 min for 4 hrs in biological
triplicates. The cells were pulsed with 0.5 mM 5-ethynyl
uridine (5-EU) (Jena Biosciences, Cat #CLK-N002-10)
for 30 min before harvesting in 1.0 ml Trizol® reagent for
RNA isolation. To biotinylate the RNA, a copper catalyzed
click reaction was performed. The reaction cocktail was
set up as follows: 1.0 µg of RNA, 4.64 µl 10 mM Biotin
Azide (Jena Biosciences, Cat #CLK-FA003-1), 6.96 µl
click reaction (1 part of 0.1 M Copper Bromide, 2 parts
0.1 M Tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]
amine (TBTA) in 3:1 DMSO/t-BuOH). The click reaction
cocktail was incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. 0.3 M NaOAc
and 1.0 ml 100% cold EtOH was added to precipitate
the RNA. Samples were incubated at -80°C overnight.
They were then spun down at 12,000 g for 20 min at
4°C. Nascent RNA pellets were washed with 70% cold
EtOH and spun at 12,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. Pellets were
resuspended in 50 µl of molecular grade water and stored
at -20°C until further use.
To capture nascent RNA, the following binding
reaction was set up: 2.0 µl RNaseOUT™ recombinant
ribonuclease inhibitor (Life Technologies, Cat #10777019), 1.0 µg biotinylated DNA, 250 µl nucleic acid
binding and wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0), and 25 µl streptavidin
magnetic beads (Solulink, Cat #M-1002). The capture
reaction was then rotated at RT for 1 h. The beads were
then washed with nucleic acid binding and wash buffer
(rotated for 5 min at RT) 5 times. After the final wash, the
beads were resuspended in 50 µl molecular grade water.
The First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific,
Cat #K1622) was used to generate cDNA using the
nascently captured RNA bound to the beads as template.
The manufacturer’s instructions were followed. cDNA
was stored at -20°C.

Cell culture
Human Prostate 1 (HPr-1) cells were grown in
Keratinocyte-Serum Free Medium (SFM) (1x) (Life
Technologies, Cat #17005-042), supplemented with
bovine pituitary extract (BPE) and 2 µg/ml epidermal
growth factor-1 (EGF1). The HPr-1AR cells which
stably overexpress exogenous AR [23] were grown and
maintained in the same conditions, along with 2 µg/ml
puromycin. For starvation conditions, HPr-1AR cells
were grown in Keratincyte-SFM without BPE or EGF1 for
48 h. For experimental conditions, HPr-1 and HPr-1AR
cells were treated with 10 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
(Sigma, Cat# A8380-1G) or ethanol (EtOH) as a vehicle.

RNA and DNA isolation
RNA and DNA were isolated from the same cell
pellet. RNA was isolated using Trizol® (Life Technologies,
Cat #15596-026), as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA was resuspended in molecular grade water and
stored at -80°C.
DNA was isolated using Trizol® reagent, with a
modified protocol. After the aqueous RNA-containing
phase was removed, all samples were spun down at 12,000
g for 5 min at 4°C. 750 µl of Back Extraction Buffer
(BEB) (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 50 mM NaCi, 1 M
Tris base) was added to all samples and then mixed for 10
min at room temperature (RT). Samples were spun down
at 12,000 g for 30 min at RT. The upper aqueous phase
was retrieved, to which 400 µl of isopropanol was added
for each 1 ml of Trizol® reagent. Samples were mixed and
incubated at RT for 5 min and then spun for 12,000 g for
15 min at 4°C. The resulting DNA pellet was washed with
500 µl of 70% EtOH. Samples were spun again at 12,000
g for 15 min at 4°C; the supernatant was removed and then
the DNA pellet was dissolved in 400 µl of 1x TE Buffer.
To further purify the DNA, 400 µl of phenol
chloroform isoamylalcohol (PCI) (25:24:1) was added to
each sample. Samples were mixed for 10 min at RT via
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

qRT-PCR
Quantitative PCR reactions were carried out using
Sybr Green reagent (Biorad, Cat# 172-5122). The reaction
was set up as per manufacturer’s instructions, using 1.5

µl of sample for each reaction. Statistical significance
was performed using the two-sided Student’s T-test (at
α=0.05). Primers used are in Supplemental Table 1.

10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.4% NP-40,
50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM NaOVa, 1 mM DTT) for
cytoplasmic protein extraction and in high salt buffer (20
mM HEPES, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,
50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM NaOVa, 1 mM DTT)
for nuclear protein extraction. Protein concentrations were
determined using the BCA assay (Pierce®, Cat #23227)
for whole protein lysates and the Bradford Assay (Thermo
Scientific, Cat #1856209) for cytoplasmic/nuclear lysates.
Both assays were performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
1 x 108 HPr-1AR cells were harvested for all ChIP
assays. Cells were crosslinked in 1.0% formaldehyde
(Sigma, Cat #F8775) and incubated for 10 min at RT
with gentle shaking. A final concentration of 0.125 M
glycine (VWR, Cat #97061-128) was added to stop the
crosslinking reaction. Cells were washed twice with cold
1X PBS and then harvested in 1X PBS supplemented with
protease inhibitors (Roche, Cat #11836153001). Cells
were pelleted at 2,000 rpm for 4 min at 4°C. After the
supernatant was aspirated, the cell pellets were lysed in 300
µl Szak’s RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5%
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) and
incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were sonicated
using a Biorupter® (Diagenode, Cat #B01010002). Lysates
were sonicated for 15 mins, consisting of 30 second on
pulses, followed by 30 seconds resting time. Chromatin
was sonicated to obtain an average smear ranging from
100-500 bps. Sonicated chromatin was spun down at
10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. For the immunoprecipitation
step, 700 µl of Szak’s RIPA buffer was added to each
sample to obtain a 1.0 ml lysate. Antibodies of interest (see
Supplemental Table 2) were then added to each sample
and incubated overnight at 4°C with slow rotation. 20 µl
of protein A or G magnetic beads (Diagenode, Cat #kch802-150, protein A; #kch-818-150, protein G) were added
for 2 hrs. Beads were then washed and resuspended in 250
µl of 1.5X Talianidas Elution Buffer (70 mM Tris-HCl pH
8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5% SDS) and incubated at 65°C for
10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, 13
µl of 4M NaCl was added and the samples were incubated
at 65°C overnight to reverse the crosslinks. The next day,
2 µl of 2 mg/ml Proteinase K (New England Biolabs, Cat
#P8102S) was added and samples were incubated at 45°C
for 1 h. DNA was precipitated using PCI extraction and
ethanol precipitation. ChIP DNA pellets were resuspended
in 50 µl 1X TE buffer and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Data
was analyzed as fold change over input. Fold change over
input was calculated as (2ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = ΔCt(DHT) ΔCt(EtOH), ΔCt = Ct(IP) - Ct(Input)). Primers used are
listed in Supplementary Table 1. Antibodies used are listed
in Supplementary Table 2.

Western blotting
Western blotting was performed using standard
protocols. PVDF membranes (Biorad, Cat #162-0177)
were used for the transfer of all proteins. All primary
antibodies (Supplementary Table 2) were incubated
overnight at 4°C, and secondary antibodies were incubated
for 1.5 h at RT. Pierce ECL western blotting substrate
(Thermo Scientific, Cat #32209) was used to detect HRPconjugated secondary antibodies via chemiluminescence
and exposed to film. Exposure times ranged from seconds
to hours, depending on the intensity of the signal.

Bisulfite treatment
750 ng of DNA was bisulfite-treated with the EZ
DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Cat #D5001),
following the manufacturer’s instructions, with the one
following modification. Final bisulfite-treated DNA was
eluted in 70 µl of elution buffer instead of 10 µl. Bisulfitetreated DNA was then stored at -20°C.

Methylation analysis
Methylation analysis was performed using
MassARRAY EpiTYPER analysis. This was performed as
described [36]. Targeted regions for methylation analysis
were amplified using specifically designed primers against
androgen response elements. Primers designed are listed in
the Supplemental Table 1.

Lucia reporter assay
The 450 bp upstream ARE of SGK1 was cloned
into the CpG-free lucia promoter vector (Invivogen, Cat#
pcpgf-prom). As the normalizing control, the pSELECTzeo-SEAP vector (Invivogen, Cat# psetz-seap) was
used. 3 x 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates to ensure
cells reach ~40% confluency in 24 h. Transfection using
LipoD293 reagent (SignaGen, Cat# SL100668) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
using a 96-well format, 0.25 µg of plasmid (both the lucia

test plasmid and the SEAP control plasmid) and 0.6 µl
of LipoD293 reagent were used for each transfection, and
transfections were performed in biological triplicates.
To detect both secreted lucia and secreted alkaline
phosphatase, Quanti-luc (Invivogen, Cat# rep-qlc1)
and Quanti-Blu (Invivogen, Cat# rep-qb1) were used
respectively, according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Lucia was measured using the Lmax luminometer machine
and SEAP was measured after overnight incubation at
37°C. Statistical significance was determined using the
two sided Student’s T-test.

Electromobility shift assay (EMSA)

Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Center Support Grant
to the Roswell Park Cancer Institute [CA016056], for
the Genomics Shared Resource at Roswell Park, where
the MassArray DNA methylation measurements were
conducted; and by the Roswell Park Alliance Foundation.

EMSA was performed as previously outlined [37].
Probes were annealed in oligonucleotide annealing buffer
(10 mM Tris, pH 7.5-8.0, 50 nM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA).
Equal volumes of complementary oligos were mixed
together and incubated at 95°C for 5 min. The mixture
was then slowly cooled down to 37°C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The SGK1 ARE I was PCR-amplified using the
primers listed in Supplemental Table 1. The primers
were designed such that they carried built-in restriction
enzyme cut sites for BamHI and SbfI. The PCR product
was then gel-purified (Qiagen, Cat# 28706) and cloned
into the pCR™2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Cat# K2040-01),
according to manufacturer’s instructions. One shot®
E.coli competent cells (Invitrogen, Cat# K2040-01) were
used for transformation, and ampicillin (Sigma, Cat#
A9393-5G) was used as the selectable marker. Restriction
enzymes BamHI (New England Biolabs, Cat# R0136S)
and SbfI (New England Biolabs, Cat# R0642S) were used
to cut out the SGK1 ARE I regulatory element from the
pCR™2.1 vector, which was gel purified and inserted
into the the CpG-free lucia promoter vector (Invivogen,
Cat# pcpgf-prom), using the same reaction conditions as
described above. The vector was transformed into E.coli
GT115 chemically competent cells (Invivogen, Cat# lyo115-11) and E. coli were cultured overnight at 37°C on
Fast-Media® Zeo agar (Invivogen, Cat# fas-zn-s).
