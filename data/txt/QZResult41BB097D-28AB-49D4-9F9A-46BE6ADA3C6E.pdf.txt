Abstract
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Dietary components
that reduce inflammation are associated with lower cancer risk. The long-chain omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is present in fish oil and has potent anti-inflammatory properties. The objective of this
study is to determine whether dietary fish oil enriched with DHA (DFO) could reduce experimentally induced
colitis and colon cancer risk in a mouse model. When SMAD3−/− mice are exposed to Helicobacter hepaticus,
mild colitis is observed 4 weeks postinfection. Mice were fed isocaloric diets modified to include corn oil,
safflower oil, or DFO (doses ranging from 0.75% to 6.00%) as the fatty acid source for 8 weeks. Mice were
gavaged with H. hepaticus; DFO feeding was continued; and mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after infection.
The colon and cecum were collected for histopathology. Spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected
and analyzed for T-cell populations using flow cytometry. Contrary to expectations, DFO induced severe colitis
and adenocarcinoma formation. DFO consumption was associated with decreased CD8+ cell frequency and
diminished CD69 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations. Mice consuming DFO also exhibited higher
FoxP3+ CD25+ CD4+ T regulatory cell frequency, FoxP3 expression, and altered L-selectin expression during
infection. We concluded that DFO-fed mice may be less equipped to mount a successful response to
H. hepaticus infection, increasing colon cancer risk. These results support the need to establish a tolerable
upper limit for DHA intake particularly in the context of chronic inflammatory conditions such as IBD.

Introduction
Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an
increased risk of developing colon cancer. Colorectal cancer is
responsible for mortality in ∼15% of people with ulcerative
colitis and Crohn's disease (1). Despite routine screening
procedures and the development of advanced treatments,
one third of patients with colon cancer will ultimately experience metastatic disease and most will die of uncontrolled
metastasis within a few years of diagnosis (2). In contrast to
colon polyps that can easily be detected through colonoscopy,
chronic colitis can result in dysplastic lesions that are difficult
to identify. Flat colorectal adenoma is associated with accelerated carcinogenesis (3, 4) and poor prognosis (5). Given the
negative outcome linked with colitis-associated colon cancer

(CACC), prevention strategies aimed at reducing inflammation in individuals with IBD may reduce cancer risk.
Several studies have shown the efficacy of dietary fish oil
(FO) consumption in IBD (6–10). Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA) and ecosapentaenoic acid (EPA), modulate
inflammatory responses through several mechanisms.
Increased consumption of dietary DHA and EPA results in
increased incorporation of these n-3 fatty acids in immune
cell membranes and occurs at the expense of arachidonic
acid (11–13). Specifically, EPA can compete with arachidonic
acid as a substrate for cyclooxygenase (COX), resulting in inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids
such as prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4. Increased
membrane PUFA content also influences the lipid raft composition and signaling properties of immune cells (14). DHA
is capable of influencing membrane fluidity, ion permeability,
fatty acid exchange, and resident protein function (14, 15).
Chronic inflammation creates an environment favorable to
tumor formation by inducing oxidative stress, inhibiting
apoptosis, and stimulating cell proliferation (16). The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) receptor is commonly
mutated in CACC (17). TGF-β is a cytokine with cytostatic
and apoptotic-inducing functions that plays an important
role in the control of mammalian cell proliferation and

(University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Homozygous males
and heterozygous females were mated to obtain SMAD3−/−
pups. Genotypes were confirmed by PCR. Animals were
housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in 60square-inch plastic cages with microinsolator lids in the
Research Containment Facility at Michigan State University

Committee on Animal Care and Use.

differentiation (18). Binding of the TGF-β receptor activates
the SMAD family of transcription factors, notably SMAD2
and SMAD3. The activated SMAD2 and SMAD3 then form
a complex with SMAD4, which migrates to the nucleus and
induces transcription of a targeted set of genes (19, 20).
Maggio-Price and colleagues (21) showed that SMAD3−/− mice
develop chronic colitis and cancer in response to gastrointestinal Helicobacter infection. Dysfunctional TGF-β signaling,
common in human IBD and colon cancer, supports the
physiologic relevance of the SMAD3−/− colitis model (22).
Hence, we selected this model to study the effects of FO
feeding on colitis and CACC outcome.
Although n-3 PUFAs have shown beneficial effects in
gastrointestinal inflammation, recent studies using animal
models and human studies provide controversial results
(23). Several studies have found no correlation between n-3
PUFA supplementation and IBD (24–28). In general, it seems
that FO supplementation may generate a depressed immune
environment through alterations in cytokine production,
T-cell proliferation, and T-cell–mediated cytotoxicity (23).
DHA can exclusively suppress T regulatory (Treg) function
(29). Interestingly, the immunomodulatory effects of DHA
+EPA may be beneficial under certain circumstances such
as chronic inflammation, but could be deleterious in acute
pro-inflammatory and immune responses to cancer.
Unexpectedly, we found that DFO feeding exacerbated colitis and colonic dysplasia, which may be mediated through
reduced CD8+ T lymphocyte populations, diminished CD69
expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and attenuated FoxP3
and L-selectin expression on Treg cells.

Diets
SMAD3−/− animals were fed isocaloric experimental diets
ad libitum beginning at 6 to 8 weeks of age. The composition
was based on the AIN-93G formulation of Reeves (30) and
modified as described previously (31). Control corn oil
(CO) diets contained 70 g/kg CO (Dyets); control safflower
oil (SF) diets contained 10 g/kg CO and 60 g/kg high oleic
acid SF (Spectrum Naturals). The DHA diets contained varying amounts of CO and DHA-enriched FO (DFO; 0.75–6%;
Ocean Nutrition Canada) as summarized in Table 1. DFO
contained 540 mg/g DHA and 50 mg/g EPA. The highest
dose of DFO at 6% was selected because it was shown to
suppress interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in previous studies
(32). Diets were freshly prepared every 2 to 3 weeks and
stored at −20°C. Food was placed in clean cups and replaced
daily to prevent oxidation.
Bacterial culture and infection
Helicobacter hepaticus strain 3B1 (American Type Culture
Collection) was kindly donated by Dr. Vince Young (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Isolates were aseptically
streaked onto blood agar and incubated at 36°C for 24 to
48 hours inside GasPak (BD Diagnostic Systems). Mice were
infected as previously described (21). Briefly, bacteria were
resuspended in tryptic soy broth at an optical density of

≥1.8. Animals were gavaged with 0.3 mL of fresh bacterial
suspension on 2 consecutive days.
Experimental design
Three separate diet studies were performed. In study 1,
male and female mice were fed either Harlan Teklad rodent
chow (CON), CO, SF, or 6.00% DFO for 8 weeks preinfection.
In study 2, mice received either SF or DFO (0.75%, 2.25%,
3.75%, or 6.00%; n = 16–20 mice per treatment). Mice consumed the assigned diet for 8 weeks before infection and
throughout 4 weeks postinfection when the experiment
was terminated. For study 3, mice were fed either 6.00%
DFO or CON and euthanized (see Table 1 for fatty acid
composition of the diets).
Tissue fixation and histopathology
Mice were asphyxiated with CO 2 and exsanguinated
through cardiac puncture. Tissue was removed, flushed
with PBS, and fixed in 10% formalin overnight and stored
in 70% ethanol. Tissues were then processed in paraffin and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Longitudinal
sections were graded for inflammation and dysplasia by a
pathologist using a blinded scoring system adapted from
Dr. Maggio-Price (21). Cecums and colons were scored on
a 1 to 4 scale both for inflammation (1, no inflammation; 2,
mild inflammation; 3, moderate inflammation; 4, marked
inflammation) and dysplasia (1, no dysplasia; 2, low-grade
dysplasia; 3, high-grade dysplasia; 4, high-grade dysplasia
with invasion/adenocarcinoma). The two scores for colon
and two scores for cecum tissue in each animal were combined such that a score of 4 indicated no inflammation or
dysplasia and a score of 16 reflected maximal inflammation
and dysplasia.
Tissue fatty acid analysis
To confirm DHA phospholipid incorporation after 8 weeks
of DFO consumption, hepatic lipid fractions were extracted
and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) as previously
described (33, 34).
Lymphocyte isolation
Spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes were aseptically
removed and placed in ice-cold RPMI at the time of necropsy. Spleens were processed with a dounce homogenizer,
pelleted, and washed in RPMI. Cells were resuspended in
ACK lysing buffer (Invitrogen) and washed twice in RPMI.
Mesenteric lymph nodes were passed through a 70-μm filter
and washed with RPMI. Cell counts were performed with
a hemocytometer by using trypan blue exclusion and resuspended to a concentration of 1 million cells per milliliter
of medium.
Flow cytometry
Cells from mesenteric lymph nodes or splenic tissue
were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting
buffer (FACS), 0.1% sodium azide, 1% fetal bovine serum,
in dPBS blocked with anti-Fc receptor γII/II [CD16/CD32
(clone 2.4G2)] for 10 minutes on ice, and incubated with

CD25 (PE), CD62L (APC), and FoxP3 (FITC or Alexa Fluor488)
for 30 minutes. Intracellular staining was performed using
FoxP3 staining buffer set as per the manufacturer's instructions (E-bioscience). Briefly, after surface staining, cells were
washed twice in FACS buffer, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 25 minutes, and permeabilized for 30 minutes. Permeabilization was followed by incubation for 30 minutes with the
appropriate antibodies diluted in permeabilization diluent.
Samples were then acquired on LSR II (BD Bioscience) and
analyzed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).
Statistics
Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software). All data were represented as mean ±
SEM. Two-way ANOVA were performed with Bonferroni's
multiple comparison test to determine differences between
two groups within a parameter unless noted otherwise.
P values <0.05 were considered significant.

Results
DFO-fed mice displayed increased intestinal
inflammation and dysplasia following
infection with H. hepaticus
Unexpectedly, we found that 4 weeks postinfection, mice
consuming 6.00% DFO had the highest degree of inflammation and dysplasia compared with the three control diets
(CO, SF, and CON; Fig. 1). The observed exacerbation in colitis was dose dependent as the 2.25% and 3.75% DFO groups

received a score falling between the 6.00% DFO and the three
controls; however, the difference in histopathology scores
between these was not statistically significant. The 0.75%
DFO group was not different from the control groups; how-

ever, it was significant when compared with the 6.00% DFO.
Because no significant differences in colitis scores were
found between the three control groups, the chow diet was
selected as a control for all remaining experiments.
Representative H&E stains of colon and cecum tissue
showed a greater number of inflammatory cells as well as epithelial proliferative lesions at 4 weeks postinfection as DFO
composition increased (Fig. 2). The control CO- and SF-fed
mice displayed increased inflammatory cell infiltration and
mild hyperplasia in the mucosa of both the cecum and colon.
These observations were expected in SMAD3−/− mice in response to infection with H. hepaticus. However, DFO-fed
mice had an even greater severity of inflammation accompanied by dysplastic crypts and mitotic figures (Fig. 2).
To confirm the presence of DHA in cellular phospholipids,
hepatic fatty acids from CON-, SF-, and DFO-fed animals
were extracted and analyzed by GC. As expected, mice consuming 6% DFO had a higher percentage of DHA-containing
phospholipids (25.38% ± 4.90, n = 4) compared with CON-fed
mice (5.71% ± 5.15, n = 5) or SF-fed mice (3.44% ± 1.68, n = 5;
P < 0.001).
DFO feeding increased postinfection mortality and
body mass loss
Mice consuming DFO had a higher mortality rate following
infection with H. hepaticus compared with the control diets
(CON, CO, SF; Fig. 3A). All mice in the CON and CO groups
and 92% of mice on the SF diet survived following infection with
H. hepaticus. However, only 82% of DFO-fed animals survived at
4 weeks, with mortality being observed as early as 1 week
postinfection in this group. The cause of mortality in the DFO
group was not further investigated as this was an unexpected
finding. However, we observed that animals in this group gained
less weight from weeks 0 to 4 after infection compared with
the CO- or SF-fed counterparts (Fig. 3B). These weight changes
were in accordance with survival data through week 4.

these proliferative alterations are accompanied by mild inflammation

variably branching dysplastic crypts (arrows), surrounded and separated
by moderately increased numbers of inflammatory cells (#). In the

an adenocarcinoma, composed of a single or nests of crypts lined by
relatively well-differentiated epithelium (arrows) and lakes of mucin that
extend into and beyond the serosal lining (*). In the colon, the wall is
thickened due to moderate inflammation and hyperplastic crypts (arrow)
that occasionally herniate into the submucosa (*).

DFO feeding modulated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell
populations in SMAD3−/− mice
The total cell counts in each group did not significantly
differ within either tissue (data not shown). CON treatment
induced kinetic differences across time in CD3+ cells whereas
DFO did not. Note the difference in CD3+ lymphocytes at day
3 postinfection in mesenteric lymph nodes of DFO-treated
animals (P < 0.05; Fig. 4A). DFO induced potent reductions
in the proportion of CD8+CD3+ cells in both tissues before
gavage and throughout infection (Fig. 4A). In addition,
DFO-fed animals exhibited increased CD4 + CD3+ splenic
T lymphocytes before infection and at day 7 (P < 0.001;
Fig. 4A). However, no differences were noted in the mesenteric lymph nodes. DFO resulted in greatly decreased percentages of CD4 + T cells from the mesenteric lymph nodes
expressing CD69 (Fig. 4B).
Regulatory T-cell populations and FoxP3 expression

from the surface of T lymphocytes upon activation (37), we
examined the proportion of CD62L− Treg cells in mesenteric
lymph nodes. An increased number of Treg cells from the
CON group did not express CD62L. Cell counts in the mesenteric lymph nodes of CON-fed animals increased significantly at days 7 and 28 postinfection, whereas no changes
occurred in the DFO group. Although the percentages of
FoxP3+ CD25+ CD4+ T differed only in the spleen and not
in mesenteric lymph nodes, the expression of FoxP3 in these
cells was altered by DFO feeding. DFO consumption resulted
in higher FoxP3 expression at days 0 and 28 postinfection in
both spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (P < 0.01 or P <
0.001), whereas DFO increased FoxP3 expression at day
7 postinfection in spleen alone (P < 0.05; Table 2).

response to DFO feeding both before infection (P < 0.05) and
at days 3, 7, and 28 postinfection (P < 0.001; Fig. 5A). No
differences in Treg cell percentages between CON and DFO
were found in mesenteric lymph nodes (data not shown).
Due to the discrepancy in Treg cells between tissues, we
examined the expression of L-selectin (CD62L), which is required for the migration of Treg cells (35) and can be altered
by n-3 PUFAs (36). A reduced percentage of the splenic
FoxP3 + CD25 + CD4 + Treg cells expressed CD62L in the
DFO group. At day 0, splenic Treg cells from CON- and
DFO-fed animals displayed no differences in CD62L expression. However, at day 28, an increased proportion of Treg
cells did not express CD62L compared with CON-fed animals. However, the numbers of Treg cells were significantly
reduced in mesenteric lymph nodes of DFO-fed animals at
day 28 postinfection (Fig. 5B). Because L-selectin is cleaved

This study investigated the effect of dietary DFO on
chronic colitis and CACC in SMAD3−/− mice in response
to infection with H. hepaticus. The results presented here
show that DFO feeding increases the severity of colitis and
mucinous adenocarcinoma in the SMAD3−/− model. The
exaggerated inflammation and carcinogenesis induced by
dietary DFO was associated with altered CD8+ T-cell populations, CD69 + activation, FoxP3 expression, and the
frequency of FoxP3+ CD25+ CD4+ Treg cells expressing Lselectin (Figs. 4 and 5). These findings implicate that
high doses of DHA consumed before and during active colitis
in SMAD3−/− animals may promote impaired immune
function.
The hyporesponsive environment elicited by FO may play
an adverse role in acute bacterial and viral infection. Dietary
FO increased mortality and impaired pathogen clearance in
response to Listeria monocytogenes (38). Similarly, fat-1 mice
with high levels of endogenous n-3 PUFAs are more susceptible to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection through diminished macrophage production of tumor necrosis factor-α,
IL-6, and IL-1β (39). A recent study by Schwerbrock and colleagues (40) showed that FO feeding had deleterious effects
on the immune response to influenza infection, which was
characterized by decreased CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes,
reduced neutrophils at the site of infection, and impaired
natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Taken together, these observations indicate that whereas FO supplementation may be beneficial in lowering the risk of some cancers (41), FO may act
differently in the etiology of infection-associated cancers.
The present studies clearly support the hypothesis that
altered immune dysregulation contributes to exacerbated colitis in SMAD mice. However, FO feeding studies in other
well-characterized murine colitis models have produced
conflicting results. One investigation reported that FO supplementation at 7% in IL-10−/− mice increased spontaneous
colitis score and colitis-associated neoplasia within 10 to
12 weeks (42). In contrast, another study reported that FO
supplementation at 4% was protective in the IL-10−/− model
when colitis development was accelerated with nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug treatment (43). These studies are difficult to compare due to differences in genetic background

and the undefined role of COX-2 inhibition in colitis. Although the majority of studies show efficacy of FO in chemically induced colitis (44), one study showed exacerbated
colitis in response to DFO feeding possibly through modified
adiponectin expression (45).
The FO dose, relative EPA and DHA content, and length
of feeding protocol are also other sources of variation. In
our study, the most severe colitis and CACC correlated with
the 6.00% DFO dose for a feeding period of 8 weeks (Fig. 1).
The dietary composition and feeding period are comparable
with other FO feeding studies, with the exception that our
DFO contained mostly DHA and only little EPA. Interestingly,
we observed that low-dose (0.75%) DFO consumption did
not ameliorate colitis score compared with control animals

(SF, CO, and CON). Furthermore, animals consuming intermediate doses of DFO (2.25% and 3.75%) experienced exacerbated inflammation and dysplasia that was comparable with
the 6.00% DFO diet (Figs. 1 and 2). Our results indicate that
DFO consumption as low as 2.25% aggravates colitis and
accelerates dysplastic tissue transformation.
Due to the potential role of impaired TGF-β signaling in
Treg cell response, we hypothesized that DHA feeding may further influence Treg cell populations. DFO-fed mice exhibited a
high proportion of splenic CD4+ T cells, and a high percentage
of this population was FoxP3+ CD25+ (Fig. 5). This suggests
that dietary DFO may be inducing a more pronounced splenic
Treg cell phenotype both under pathogen-free conditions and
during infection. Interestingly, although no difference was

across time (indicated by “a” or “b”) and at each time point between diet treatments (indicated by asterisks), n = 5 to 6 animals per group. A, CON treatment
induced kinetic differences across time in CD3+ cells whereas DFO did not. Note the difference in CD3+ lymphocytes at day 3 postinfection in mesenteric

CD8+CD3+ cells in both tissues before gavage and throughout infection. DFO-fed animals exhibited increased CD4+CD3+ splenic T lymphocytes before
infection and at day 7 (P < 0.001). However, no differences were noted in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Spln, spleen; MsLN, mesenteric lymph nodes.

found in FoxP3+ CD25+ populations in the mesenteric lymph
nodes, FoxP3 mean fluorescence intensity expression was
enhanced in both the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes in
DFO-fed mice (Table 2). Indeed, a recent study by Yessoufou
and colleagues (46) showed that dietary DHA increases FoxP3
expression in murine Treg cells possibly through inhibition of

SMAD7. The authors also noted that upregulation of FoxP3
did not necessarily correlate with the suppressive capacity
of Treg cells because Treg cells from DHA-fed animals failed
to suppress the proliferation of cocultured CD4+ T effector
cells also derived from DHA-fed animals. Hence, DHA may
induce a strong Treg phenotype through upregulation of

Figure 5. Frequencies of FoxP3+ CD25+ CD4+ Treg cell CD62L expression in spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes at days 3, 7, and 28 postinfection.
A, left, splenic percentages of double-positive FoxP3/CD25+ cells remained significantly elevated both at baseline and throughout the course of infection in
DFO-fed animals (*, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001). A decreased percentage of these Treg cells were CD62L+ in DFO-fed animals beginning at day 3 postinfection
(**, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; right). Representative splenic CD62L expression is shown on Treg cells at days 0 and 28 postinfection (gray line, CON; dark
line, DFO). No differences in the distribution between CD62L+ and CD62L− were noted at day 0. A greater proportion of Treg cells were CD62L− at
day 28 postinfection in the DFO group (dark line). B, left, FoxP3+ CD25+ CD4+ Treg cell counts from mesenteric lymph nodes were decreased in the DFO
group at day 28 postinfection (P < 0.01). The total number of CD62L− Treg cell was also decreased in DFO-fed animals at day 28 postinfection (P < 0.001;
right). Note that the cell number in mesenteric lymph nodes increased significantly at days 7 and 28 postinfection in CON (P < 0.05) but not in DFO.

FoxP3 expression; however, this population fails to initiate
suppressive action on effector T cells. Although we did not
examine the effect of DFO at doses <6.00% on Treg cells,
Yessoufou and colleagues observed similar effects on FoxP3
expression at roughly 2% FO.
Recent evidence suggests that Treg cells may promote tumor progression through the production of IL-17 (47). Under
poorly regulated pro-inflammatory conditions, Treg may fail
to inhibit and may instead contribute to a T helper (Th)-17–
driven procarcinogenic process (48). DFO may promote the
production of Treg cells with decreased suppressive capacity
and simultaneously accelerate adenocarcinoma development
during the later stages of infection. The exact mechanism for
these observations and their consequences are still unknown.
We observed that a significantly decreased proportion
of splenic Treg cells in the DFO group expressed L-selectin
at days 3, 7, and 28 postinfection (Fig. 5A). This observation
is consistent with previous studies showing decreased Lselectin expression in response to DHA (46). Because L-selectin
is important in lymphocyte migration to the mesenteric lymph
nodes and Peyer's patches (37), our data suggest that DFO may
decrease the ability of Treg cells to migrate to lymph nodes in
close proximity to the site of infection. Incorporation of PUFAs
into human cell membranes was recently shown to decrease
L-selectin expression (49).
It is noteworthy that the percentage of Treg cells in the
spleen remained elevated throughout infection. Although
the percentage was similar between CON and DFO in
mesenteric lymph nodes, we found that the number of Treg
cells was significantly decreased at day 28 postinfection.
Decreased Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes at
day 28 could contribute to the increase in inflammation
and dysplasia observed in DFO-fed animals. Moreover, a
decreased number of Treg cells were defined as L-selectin
negative (CD62L−) in the mesenteric lymph nodes of DFOfed mice. This indicates that in addition to fewer numbers
of Treg cells near the site of infection at day 28, the DFO
group had a decreased number of activated Treg cells at
day 28 as indicated by the loss of L-selectin (37).

H. hepaticus produces a virulence factor, cytolethal
distending toxin (CDT), which is required for extended colonization and inflammation of the murine gut (50). CDT enters mammalian cells and exhibits DNase I–like activity,
which results in double-stranded DNA breaks and G2 phase
cell cycle arrest before mitosis (51), induces apoptosis in
cultured T cell lines (52), and suppresses the function of
macrophages and dendritic cells (53). CD8 + cytotoxic T
lymphocytes are essential in eliminating infected and
transformed host cells. Thus, CDT promotes pathogenesis
by disabling immune response and impairing repair of
damaged tissue.
Recent studies reveal that DFO polarizes CD4+ T helper cells
toward a Th2 phenotype both through inhibition of the Th1
cytokine INF-γ (54) and direct suppression of IL-2–induced
autocrine proliferation of Th1 cells (43). We observed diminished CD8+ T-cell populations in DFO-fed mice before infection (Fig. 4C). Additionally, DFO feeding was associated with
decreased CD69 activation on CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes.
A recent study found that DHA supplementation in humans
specifically decreased CD69 expression on lymphocytes in response to stimulation with Concanavalin A. An increased
splenic CD4 to CD8 ratio resulting from both decreased CD8+
cell populations and increased CD4+ cell populations could in
part be accounted for by the increased predominance of FoxP3
CD25 CD4+ Treg cells in DFO-fed animals. Although we did not
characterize these cell populations postinfection, our data
suggest that DFO feeding creates an immunosuppressed host
environment, characterized by reduced numbers of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, decreased CD69 activation, and unfavorable
L-selectin expression on Treg cells. Compared with control
animals, DFO-fed animals may be less equipped to mount a
successful response to H. hepaticus infection. Further studies
are required to assess proliferative capacity, cytokine production, and migratory abilities of adaptive immune cell populations in DFO-fed animals before and throughout the course
of H. hepaticus infection.
These findings support a growing body of literature implicating deleterious effects of high-dose FO consumption and

certain disease states. Investigations regarding FO supplementation in human IBD have used FO doses ranging between
500 mg/d and 7 g/d (24). Our diets mimicked 1 g/d (0.75%),
3 g/d (2.25%), 5 g/d (3.75%), and 8 g/d (6.00%) DFO when
calculated as a component of a 2,000 kcal human diet. We observed inflammatory and dysplastic changes at the 3, 5, and 8 g
equivalent. The most dramatic increase was observed at the
8 g/d dose. Currently, efforts are under way to establish dietary
reference intakes for EPA and DHA due to substantial evidence supporting beneficial effects of FO consumption in
the prevention of common diseases such as coronary artery
disease and cognitive decline (55). Consumer intakes of DHA
and EPA continue to increase with growing FO supplement
consumption and addition of n-3 PUFAs to foods (i.e., functional food). Studies from our group and others' advocate

establishing a tolerable upper limit for FO consumption to
protect certain immunocompromised sectors of the population who may be at risk for pathogen-associated enteric
inflammation and gastrointestinal cancers.
