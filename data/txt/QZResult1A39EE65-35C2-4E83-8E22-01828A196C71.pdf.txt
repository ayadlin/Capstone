ABSTRACT:
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignant plasma cell disorder. We
have evaluated the counts of Multiple Myeloma Cells (MMCs) and normal plasma
cells (N-PCs), seven days after high-dose melphalan (HDM) and autologous stem
transplantation (ASCT). Two third of patients had detectable minimal residual
disease (MRD+) (71.7 MMCs/µL) after induction treatment with dexamethasone and
proteasome inhibitor. MMC counts were reduced by 92% (P ≤ .05) but not eradicated
7 days after HDM+ASCT. Post-HDM+ASCT MMCs were viable and bathed in a burst
of MMC growth factors, linked with post-HDM aplasia. In one third of patients
(MRD- patients), MMCs were not detectable after induction treatment and remained
undetectable after HDM+ASCT. Major difference between MRD- and MRD+ patients is
that N-PC counts were increased 3 fold (P < .05) by HDM+ASCT in MRD- patients, but
were unaffected in MRD+ patients. Possible explanation could be that clearance of
MMCs in MRD- patients makes more niches available for N-PCs. Thus, MMCs are not
fully eradicated shortly after HDM, are bathed in high concentrations of MMC growth
factors in an almost desert BM, are viable in short-term culture, which suggests
providing additional therapies shortly after HDM to kill resistant MMCs before full
repair of lesions.

INTRODUCTION

treatment with high dose melphalan (HDM) supported by
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Autologous
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are collected after 3
to 4 cycles of induction therapy, HSC being mobilized
into peripheral blood (PB) using granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) alone or in combination with
cyclophosphamide. The association of immunomodulatory
drugs (Thalidomide® or Revlimid®) to proteasome
inhibitor (Bortezomib, B) and high doses dexamethasone
improves the rates of complete responses after induction
and intensification treatment.[3] The major therapeutic
questions addressed by large ongoing clinical trials

Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the
accumulation of clonal malignant plasma cells (PCs),
primarily in the bone marrow (BM). It affects every
year 86000 new patients throughout the world.[1] MM
is still an incurable disease with a median survival in
excess of 5 years.[2] For patients below 65-70 years,
first line treatment includes 4-6 cycles of induction
therapy based on novel agents (proteasome inhibitor or
immunomodulatory drugs), high dose dexamethasone
(D) and DNA targeting drugs, followed by intensification

concern the remaining role of HDM and ASCT versus
novel agent combinations alone without intensification
and the place for consolidation/maintenance therapies.
In parallel to large randomized clinical trials, it could
be useful to carefully evaluate the effect of a reference
treatment option on malignant plasma cells (multiple
myeloma cells, MMCs) as well as on their normal plasma
cell (N-PC) counterpart in vivo. The use of multiparameter
flow cytometry (MFC) makes it possible to discriminate
and count MMCs and N-PCs in the BM or PB of patients.
[4] The opportunity to acquire and compute large numbers
of events (5 x 106 cells) allows the detection of 1 MMC
or N-PC in 105 cells.[5] Using a similar approach, Paiva
et al. showed that minimal residual disease (MRD)
assessed 3 months after HDM and ASCT, is the most
powerful independent prognosis factor for event free and
overall survival.[6] More recently, this group showed that
negative MFC immunophenotypic response is an earlier
marker than immunofixation to predict complete response,
at least with a 10-5 sensitivity.[7]
In this study, we address the question of the effects
of HDM and ASCT on MMCs and N-PCs. For two third
of the patients, MMCs were detected in the BM after BD
induction treatment. HDM and ASCT reduced but did
not eradicate these MMCs. These post-HDM MMCs are
viable and bathed in a burst of MMC growth factors, likely

induced by post HDM aplasia. This suggests providing
additional hits shortly after HDM to kill these resistant
MMCs before full repair of lesions.

RESULTS
Detection of viable myeloma cells 7 days after
high dose melphalan and autologous stem cell
transplantation in patients with residual multiple
myeloma cells one day before melphalan.
After induction treatment with 4-6 courses of
BD, MMCs could be detected in BM samples of 18/27
(67%) patients the day before HDM infusion. These 18
patients are termed patients with positive MRD (MRD+).
The median MMC count was 71.7 MMCs/µL (range 0.4285.5 MMCs/µL) (Figure 2A and Table 2). For 17 of the
18 MRD+ patients, MMCs could still be detected in the
BM 7 days after HDM and ASCT, however with a 92%
reduction in median MMC counts (5.5 MMCs/µL versus
71.7 MMCs/µL, P ≤ .001) (Table 2). Post-HDM residual
MMCs were viable cells, since they could survive for 6
days when cultured in vitro (Figure 2B). MMCs were
evaluated in the grafted stem cell products of 16 of the

18 MRD+ patients. For 11 of these 16 MRD+ patients, the
thawed stem cell products grafted to patients contained
MMCs (Table 3). The median MMC count was 0.03 x 106
cells/kg, range 0-1.2 x 106 cells/kg, 100 fold lower than
the median count of grafted CD34 stem cells (Table 3).
BM could be collected 3 months after HDM for 12 of the
18 MRD+ patients. MMCs were detected in 9 of these 12
samples with a median MMC count of 2.4 cells/µL at 3
months (Table 2).

harvested 7 days after HDM and ASCT. No MMCs were
detected in the thawed stem cell products of these MRDpatients (Table 3). Seven of the 9 MRD- patients could be
evaluated 3 months after HDM. Only in one patient, a low
count of BM MMCs was detected (1.3 MMCs/µL).

The count of peripheral blood multiple myeloma
cell is not a sensitive indicator of minimal residual
disease.

No detection of multiple myeloma cells 7 days
after high dose melphalan and autologous stem
cell transplantation in patients with no residual
myeloma cells the day before melphalan.

PB MMCs were undetectable in 6 of the 18 patients
with detectable BM MMCs one day before HDM and in
8 of 14 patients with detectable BM MMCs 7 days after
HDM and ASCT. Moreover 3 months after HDM, none of
the 11 patients with detectable BM MMCs had detectable
circulating MMCs (Table 2). No patients without
detectable MMCs in the BM one day before HDM had
detectable PB MMCs.

Thirty-three percent of the patients (9/27) had no
detectable MMCs (< 1 MMC/105 cells) in BM samples
the day before HDM infusion (Table 2). These patients
are named MRD- patients. Representative cytometry data
of one patient are shown in Figure 2C. No MMCs could
be detected either in the BM of these 9 MRD- patients

Figure 2: Assessment of Multiple Myeloma Cells and Normal Plasma cells in representative patients with Multiple
Myeloma before and after high dose melphalan. Using 7 color-multiparameter flow cytometry, multiple myeloma cells (MMCs)
and normal plasma cells (N-PCs) were assessed in bone marrow or peripheral blood samples of patients after induction treatment (1 day
before high dose melphalan, HDM), 7 days after HDM and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), 3 months after
HDM. MMCs and N-PCs were also measured in the thawed stem cell leukapheresis product grafted to the patients. (A) MMC and N-PC
evaluation in a representative patient with positive residual disease after induction treatment (MRD+). MMCs were identified on the basis
of aberrant CD56 expression and monoclonal lambda light chain expression. Data are the dotplots of CD56 and Lambda light chain
expressions. MMCs were undetectable 7 days and 3 months after HDM+ASCT in the peripheral blood. (B) Bone marrow cells from one
representative MRD+ patient out of 3 were harvested 7 days after HDM+ASCT and cultured for 6 days with 2 ng/mL of IL-6. Before
culture, bone marrow cells contained CD38high CD56+ MMCs (70% of CD38high cells) and CD38highCD56- N-PCs. After a 6-day, the CD38high
CD56+ MMCs were viable, being Annexin V- 7AAD-. (C) N-PC evaluation and lack of MMCs in a representative patient with negative
residual disease after induction treatment. MMCs of this patient aberrantly expressed CD56 and CD200 at diagnosis. After induction
treatment, only N-PCs could be detected in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and leukapheresis product.

the median N-PC count one day before HDM was 5.8
cells/µL, and was not significantly different from that
in MRD+ patients (Table 2). However 7 days after
HDM+ASCT, the median N-PC count in the BM was
3-fold higher than before HDM (17.2 N-PC/µL versus 5.8
N-PC/µL, P = .02). It was 5.2 fold higher in MRD- patients
compared to MRD+ patients (17.2 N-PC/µL versus 3.3
N-PC/µL, P = .02). The same holds true for peripheral
blood. In MRD- patients, N-PC counts after HDM were
significantly increased 2 fold compared to those before
N-PCs, whereas they were similar in MRD+ patients (Table

N-PCs were detected in all BM or PB samples

one day before HDM was 4.3 cells/µL and was not
significantly different from those measured 7 days and 3
months after HDM+ASCT (Table 2). In MRD- patients,

2 and Supplemental Figure S2). Interestingly, the stem
cell products collected from MRD- patients and grafted to
these patients contained a significant 3-fold higher N-PC
count (P < .05, 1.6 x 106 viable N-PCs/kg) than those from
MRD+ patients (0.5 x 106 N-PCs/kg). In MRD- patients,
the median N-PC count in the thawed stem cells product
grafted to patients was close to the median CD34 stem cell
count (1.6 x 106 N-PCs /kg versus 2.8 x 106 CD34+ cells/
kg) (Table 3). Three months after HDM, the median N-PC
count in MRD- patients dropped to 6.5 cells/µL and was
similar to that in MRD+ patients (6.1 cells/µL). Of note,
B lymphocyte counts (see Supplemental Figure S1) were
similar between MRD- and MRD+ patients 7 days after
HDM and ASCT, in thawed leukapheresis products as well
as before and 3 months after HDM (results not shown).

communication proteins were also investigated in paired
BM plasma of 17 patients harvested 1 day before and
7 days after HDM and ASCT. Concentrations of IL-6,
VEGF, BAFF, CCL2, IL-8, IL-15, and IL-5 significantly
increased respectively 4.8, 6.7, 119.4, 8.8, 9.4, 9.2 and
4.9 fold (P < .05) 7 days after HDM and ASCT (Figure
3). On the other hand, the concentrations of CCL3, IL12, and CCL5 decreased significantly 1.2, 2.1 and 2.1 fold
respectively (P < .05). The concentrations of other 13 cell
communication proteins, in particular of IGF1, IL-21,
and APRIL, were not affected by HDM treatment (data
not shown). The rise in G-CSF concentration observed 7
days after HDM+ASCT is hardly surprising since patients
received pegylated G-CSF on day 5 after autologous stem
cell graft (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
Several interesting observations were provided
by the current study investigating the early effects of
HDM+ASCT on MMCs and N-PCs. First, in 2 third
of patients, residual MMCs could be detected in the
BM after BD induction treatment in agreement with
previously-reported response rate[2], and HDM reduced
by 92% residual MMC counts but did not eradicate them.
Residual post-HDM MMCs in the BM are viable cells
and are bathed in high concentrations of MMC growth
factors, particularly IL-6, BAFF, VEGF, and CCL2.[8]

Twenty-three cell communication proteins could be
detected (above detection limits) in the BM plasma of MM
patients using Luminex or ELISA methodologies. Only
BAFF concentration was significantly different (P = .003)
between MRD- and MRD+ patients before HDM treatment.
It was significantly 2 fold higher in MRD- patients (1753.6
pg/mL) compared to MRD+ patients (910.3 pg/mL). Cell

Given the very low counts of residual MMCs post HDM
and ASCT, all BM sample had to be used to count MMCs
and N-PCs and it was not possible to investigate whether
these residual MMCs were in the cell cycle and underwent
DNA repair, and this in comparison with their normal
counterpart. But once flow cytometry methodologies to
measure cell cycle and genomic instability will improve,
this should be critical to investigate. An important point
is the location and the survival niche of these post HDM
residual MMCs. Primary MMCs are strongly dependent
on the BM environment and purified MMCs dye within
3 days in in vitro culture once separated from their
environment.[9] Niche cells supporting primary MMC[1012] survival include endothelial cells[13], stromal
cells[14-16], osteoblasts[17], osteoclasts[18-20], but also
a large number of differentiated short-living hematopoietic
cells: monocytes, myeloid cells[21] and megakaryocytes.
[22] Shortly after HDM, short-living niche cells are
cleared and the BM is almost desert. One can speculate
that part of HDM effectiveness to reduce MMC load could
be due to the clearance of short-living hematopoietic
cells supporting MMC survival. The residual MMCs are
likely bound to a few HDM resistant environment cells,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

at least endothelial cells, stromal cells, osteoblasts, and
osteoclasts. Because of bleeding risk, it was not possible
to perform bone biopsies early post HDM to identify
niche cells binding resistant MMC and promoting their
survival. The identification of these HDM resistant niche
cells should be useful to design strategies targeting MMC/
niche cell interactions for early post-HDM consolidation.
In particular, it should be interesting to investigate
whether residual MMCs are located far from the vessels,
suggesting exposure to lower melphalan concentration, as
documented for drug resistance in pancreatic cancer cells.
[23] Promising strategies might be to inject anti-MMC
monoclonal antibodies to kill post-HDM MMCs through
complement dependent cytotoxicity or antibody dependent
cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), providing these mAbs would
not target and kill HSCs. Since there is a huge rise of
activated monocytes during post ASCT hematopoietic
recovery, this window could be optimal to promote ADCC
to residual MMCs. Of note, MMCs express CS1/SLAMF7
[24-26], CD200 [27, 28], and CCR2 [19, 29] and mAbs
to these proteins are already being investigated in clinical
trials[30]. Anti-cytokine therapies could also be of
interest to block residual MMC survival. In particular, our

group has shown that anti-IL-6 mAb therapy is feasible
throughout HDM and ASCT with no adverse effects
regarding hematopoietic recovery.[31]
A second intriguing observation is that HDM and
ASCT resulted in a 3-fold increase in N-PC counts in
MRD- patients, whereas N-PC counts are unaffected by
HDM and ASCT in MRD+ patients. This increase was
found both in BM and PB samples. N-PC counts were
similar in the BM of MRD- and MRD+ patients before
HDM and 3 months after HDM and ASCT. This 3-fold
increase in N-PC counts in MRD- patients early after
HDM and ASCT could be due to higher counts of grafted
N-PCs. Indeed, the thawed leukapheresis products of
MRD- patients contained 3-fold more N-PCs (1.6 x 106
N-PCs /kg) than those of MRD+ patients (0.5 x 106 N-PCs
/kg), whereas CD34 HSC counts (2.8 x 106 CD34+ cells/
kg versus 2.9 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) or B cell counts were
similar. Given the known biology of N-PC, the current
observation suggests that the ability of the immune
system to produce N-PCs is more efficient in patients who
will respond better to BD induction therapy. In healthy
individuals, N-PCs are mostly long-surviving ones
accounting for 109 N-PCs in full body located in the BM
and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues.[32] New PCs
are generated in the lymph nodes[33], exit into the PB (2
N-PCs/µL)[34], and have to home to BM or mucosa to
find a niche providing survival signals.[32] Of note, some
mature N-PCs may be induced to recirculate into PB in
individuals vaccinated with tetanus toxoid likely due to a
competition between newly generated PCs and old ones
for a limited niche[35]. Similarly, mature N-PCs may be
also mobilized into PB similar to HSCs in individuals
receiving G-CSF.[36]
Providing niche cells available to support PC
survival mainly regulate N-PC count[32], the increased
N-PC count after high dose cyclophosphamide and
G-CSF treatment or after HDM and ASCT in patients
achieving negative MRD suggests the number of PC
niche is increased in these patients. One can speculate that
in MRD- patients, BD induction treatment clear MMCs
from a vast majority of PC niches making more niches
available for N-PCs.[37] Alternatively, one can speculate
that stromal cells from patients who will achieve negative
MRD are more prompt to support N-PC survival, whereas
those from MRD+ patients are more prompt to support
MMC survival. In particular, we and others, have shown
that BM stromal cells from patients with active MM have
a different gene expression profiling than those from agerelated healthy individuals.[14]
In conclusion, multicolor flow cytometry makes it
possible in each patient to visualize the effects of a given
drug combination on MMCs and also on their normal
PC counterpart. This was applied here to HDM and
ASCT treatment, which highlights a promising window
to understand some mechanisms of drug resistance, and
design new treatments to overcome it.

Patients, treatment, and response assessment
Twenty-seven consecutive MM patients from a
single center (University Hospital, Montpellier, France)
were included in this study (Figure 1). All patients had
symptomatic untreated MM. Patients’ characteristics at
diagnosis are shown in Table 1. Samples were collected
after patients’ written informed consent in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and institutional research
board approval from Montpellier University hospital (N°
DC-2008-417). According to the French standard first line
treatment, patients received an induction treatment of 4-6
cycles of BD followed by high-dose melphalan (HDM,
200 mg/m2) and ASCT. After the third BD cycle, patients
received 10 µg/kg/day of G-CSF or 10 µg/kg/day of
G-CSF plus 2 g/m2 cyclophosphamide in order to mobilize
and collect HSCs. Response to therapy was assessed
according to international criteria modified to include the
category of near complete response (nCR: electrophoresis
negative for M-protein, but immunofixation positive).[38,
39] Response assessment to BD induction (1 day before
HDM) showed 48 % complete remission (CR) or nCR,
22 % of very good partial responses (VGPR) and 22 % of
partial responses (PR). Three months after transplantation,
62% of patients were in CR/nCR, 21% in VGPR, and 8%
in PR.

Cell samples
PB and BM samples were harvested i) after
induction treatment (i.e. 1 day before HDM, ii) 7 days
after ASCT (i.e. 9 days after HDM), and iii) 3 months
after HDM+ASCT. An aliquot of the thawed leukapheresis
stem cell product grafted to the patient was also assessed.
Erythrocytes were lysed with NH4Cl (0.7 mol/L) and
leukocyte counts determined using ABX PENTRA 60
Analyzer (HORIBA ABX, Montpellier, France).

Antibodies
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) conjugated to
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE),
energy-coupled dye (ECD), PE-cyanin 5.5 (PE-Cy5·5),
PE-Cy7, Pacific Blue, and allophycocyanin (APC),
specific for human CD27 (clone L128), CD56 (N-CAM,
clone B159), CD117 (clone 104D2), CD138 (clone
MI15), lambda immunoglobulin light chain (Ig Lambda,
clone JDC-12), and kappa immunoglobulin light chain
(Ig Kappa, clone TB 28-2) were purchased from Becton/
Dickinson (BDi) Biosciences (San Jose, CA). CD19
(clone J3-119), CD20 (clone B9E9), CD34 (clone 581),

CD38 (clone LS198.4.3), CD45 (clones J33), and CD138
(clone B-A38) were obtained from Beckman Coulter
(Fullerton, CA). CD200 (clone OX104) was purchased
from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA).

Multiparameter
immunophenotyping

flow

10-5 in the bone marrow or peripheral blood one day before
HDM and 3 months post HDM, in line with previous
reports.[4, 5] It was 2 x 10-4 seven days after HDM and
ASCT due to the low leukocyte counts shortly after HDM.
An additional labeling was performed with anti-CD34
and anti-CD45. CD45+ cells were first gated, HSCs were
defined as [CD45+ and CD34+] cells, and the frequency of
HSC was evaluated. Data were analyzed with FlowJo 9.1
software (Tree star, Ashland, Oregon). For leukapheresis
product, the count of CD34+ HSCs was also measured
using a FC500 (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer.

cytometry

Multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotyping
was performed using a 7-color immunofluorescence
technique as indicated.[34] Erythrocyte-lysed bone
marrow, peripheral blood or leukapheresis samples were
labeled with anti-CD19, CD20, CD38 and CD45 mAbs in
all 7-color panels in association with either anti-CD138,
CD27, CD56, CD117, CD200 or isotype control, namely
CD138, CD27, CD56, CD117, CD200 or isotype control
panels. Isotype control panel allowed evaluating levels of
background fluorescence on plasma cell (PC) population.
Cells were then fixed and permeabilized with the
Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BDi Biosciences), and labeled with
anti-Ig Kappa and anti-Ig Lambda mAbs. Data acquisition
was performed with a Cyan flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter), driven by Summit 4.3 software (Beckman
Coulter). A two-step acquisition procedure was adopted.
In the first step, 5 x 106 nucleated cells were acquired from
the CD138 panel. This panel enabled the identification
and counts of B-lymphocytes and PCs. The second step
aimed at improving the sensitivity of PCs detection and
at precisely assessing the counts of normal PCs (N-PCs)
and multiple myeloma cells (MMCs). A broad “live-gate”
was drawn to select cells with high CD38 expression (i.e.
CD38hi events). They were recorded and stored for the socalled CD27, CD56, CD117, CD200, and isotype control,
7 color panels as described.[6]
The Supplemental Figure S1 describes the
multiparameter flow cytometry strategy used to
differentiate B-lymphocytes, N-PCs and MMCs.
Cell debris, platelets and doublets were excluded
in a first step. B-lymphocytes were defined as
[CD19+CD20+CD45+CD38-/+ and (Kappa+ or Lambda+)]
cells and PCs as [CD38high and (Kappa+ or Lambda+) and
(not B lymphocytes)] cells. MMCs were identified on the
basis of the monoclonal expression of Kappa or Lambda
light chains together with the aberrant expression of one
or several myeloma markers: expression of CD20 and/or
CD56 and/or CD117 and/or CD200, lack of expression of
CD19, and lack or weak expression of CD27 and/or CD45
(Supplemental Table S1).[4, 27, 28, 40] As MMCs in a
given patient can express several “myeloma markers”, the
MMC count was determined using the marker providing
the maximum MMC count. To define that MMCs were
detectable (i.e. positive MRD), a minimum of 100 MMCs
events acquired was required.[5] Based on the counts of
nucleated cells, which can be collected and processed by
flow cytometer, the minimal detectable MMC count was

Culture of primary myeloma cells
Erythrocyte-lysed BM samples (the day before
HDM and 7 days after HDM+ASCT) were cultured
for 6 days at 4 x 105 nucleated cells/mL in RPMI 1640
culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(Invitrogen) and rIL-6 (2 ng/mL) (AbCys SA). At the end
of the culture, cell count and viability were assayed using
trypan blue exclusion. MMCs and N-PCs were quantified
using flow cytometry as described above and apoptotic
cells detected using Annexin V-FITC / 7AAD (Beckman
Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Data were analyzed with Kaluza
1.1 software (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).

Assay for cell communication signals
The concentrations of 30 cytokines / chemokines
were measured in duplicates using multiplex bead based
Luminex® technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), with
the following sensitivity: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) (>15 pg/
mL), IL-1RA (>30 pg/mL), IL-2 (>6 pg/mL), IL-2R (>47
