Abstract
Tumors with mutant RAS are often dependent on extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling for
growth; however, MEK inhibitors have only marginal antitumor activity in these tumors. MEK inhibitors relieve
ERK-dependent feedback inhibition of RAF and cause induction of MEK phosphorylation. We have now identiﬁed
a MEK inhibitor, CH5126766 (RO5126766), that has the unique property of inhibiting RAF kinase as well.
CH5126766 binding causes MEK to adopt a conformation in which it cannot be phosphorylated by and released
from RAF. This results in formation of a stable MEK/RAF complex and inhibition of RAF kinase. Consistent with
this mechanism, this drug does not induce MEK phosphorylation. CH5126766 inhibits ERK signaling output more
effectively than a standard MEK inhibitor that induces MEK phosphorylation and has potent antitumor activity as
well. These results suggest that relief of RAF feedback limits pathway inhibition by standard MEK inhibitors.
CH5126766 represents a new type of MEK inhibitor that causes MEK to become a dominant-negative inhibitor of
RAF and that, in doing so, may have enhanced therapeutic activity in ERK-dependent tumors with mutant RAS.

Introduction
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is activated in
many human tumors including those with BRAF, RAS, and NF1
mutations and some with activated growth factor receptors.
The pathway has been shown to play a role in driving proliferation, suppressing apoptosis, and in mediating other aspects
of the transformed phenotype and is thought to be necessary
for the maintenance of the growth and viability of many tumors
(1). This has led to efforts to develop inhibitors of components
of this pathway as antitumor agents (2). Recently, inhibitors of
the MEK and RAF kinases have met with some success in the

treatment of melanomas with V600E or V600K BRAF mutations (3–5). RAF inhibitors only inhibit extracellular signal–
regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in cells with activating mutation of BRAF and activate ERK signaling in other cells (6, 7).
They therefore have a wide therapeutic index and remarkable
activity in patients with melanoma with mutant BRAF but
clearly cannot be effective in tumors with mutant RAS due to
paradoxical activation of RAF (7–9). MEK inhibitors have
signiﬁcant activity in patients with mutant BRAF melanoma
(3) and some activity in patients with RAS-mutant tumors
(10–12). However, the ability of MEK inhibitors to potently
inhibit ERK signaling may be limited by their toxicity and by
relief of ERK-dependent feedback inhibition of RAF, which
causes induction of MEK phosphorylation (13).
Here, we describe a novel allosteric MEK inhibitor
CH5126766 (RO5126766) that was generated by derivatization
of a drug identiﬁed in a screen for compounds that induces
p27Kip1 expression in tumor cells. CH5126766 inhibits MEK but
also suppresses feedback induction of RAF-dependent MEK
phosphorylation. In KRAS-mutant tumor xenograft models,
CH5126766 causes greater suppression of ERK pathway output
and antitumor activity compared with that elicited by a MEK
inhibitor that induces RAF-mediated MEK phosphorylation.

site fused to BRAF 417-766, ProQinase), B-RAF V600E (Nterminally GST-His6-thrombin cleavage site fused to BRAF
417-766 with a V600E mutation, ProQinase), and Raf-1 (Nterminally GST-tagged Raf-1 306-end with mutations Y340D
and Y341D, Millipore) were used. For MEK biochemical assays,
MEK1 S218E/S222E (N-terminally His6-fused full-length MEK1
with S218E and S222E mutations) and mitogen-activated
protein (MAP) kinase 2/Erk 2 (N-terminally His6-fused fulllength mouse MAP kinase 2/Erk2, Millipore) were used. For
biophysical analysis, N-terminally His6-tagged unphosphorylated full-length wild-type MEK1 kinase [1–393; MAP2K1
(MEK1) recombinant human protein, P3093] and N-terminally
GST-fused phosphorylated full-length wild-type MEK1 kinase
(1–393; MAP2K1, 07-141) were purchased from Invitrogen and
Carna Bioscience respectively. N-terminally GST-fused BRAF
kinase domain (433–726; GST-BRAF), N-terminal GST-tagged
CRAF kinase domain (306–648) Y340D/Y341D (GST-CRAF),
and N-terminal GST-tagged BRAF kinase domain (433–726)
with V600E mutation (GST-BRAF V600E) were purchased from
Carna Bioscience [BRAF (09-112), RAF1 (09-125) and BRAF
(V600E), respectively]. All cell lines except for human leukemic
monocyte lymphoma cell line U937 were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured under
the conditions that are described on the ATCC website (http://
www.atcc.org/). U937 is a kind gift from Dr. Y. Honma at
Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Saitama, Japan,
and was maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
High-throughput screening for compounds that induce
p27Kip1 expression
High-throughput screening to identify compounds that
induce p27Kip1 used a reporter gene assay with a human
p27Kip1 gene promoter region. The reporter plasmid p27PFLuc contained a DNA fragment comprising the XhoI site
(3,568) to SmaI site (12) of the p27Kip1 gene promoter
cloned upstream of the ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter gene in
pGVB21. This plasmid was transiently transfected into U937
cells by electroporation. The transfected cells were exposed to
10 mmol/L of individual 230,000 compounds from Chugai's
chemical library for 48 hours, the luciferase activity was
measured, and p27Kip1 protein induction was conﬁrmed with
p27Kip1 ELISA assay after 2-day incubation of tumor cell lines
with compounds.
MEK and RAF kinase enzyme assays
The inhibitory activities against CRAF, BRAF, or BRAF
V600E enzymes were measured by quantiﬁcation of phosphorylation of inactive K97R MEK1 [MEK1 (Millipore)] by recombinant RAF proteins [BRAF: B-RAF wt (ProQinase), BRAF
V600E: B-RAF V600E (ProQinase) or CRAF: Raf-1 (Millipore)]
with Europium-anti-MEK1/2 (pSer218/222) antibody (PerkinElmer) and SureLight allophycocyanine-anti-6his antibody
(PerkinElmer) by measuring time-resolved ﬂuorescence (TRF).
Alternatively, the inhibitory activities against the RAF enzymes
were measured by quantiﬁcation of phosphorylation of a
ﬂuorescein-labeled peptide corresponding to human MEK1
212-224 and human MEK2 217-229 (5-Fl-SGQLIDSMANSFV-

NH2, MEKtide) by using the IMAP ﬂuorescence polarization
(FP) Screening Express Kit (Molecular Devices).
Inhibition of MEK1 was evaluated by a coupled assay with
active MEK1 (MEK1 S218E/S222E, ProQinase) and unactive
dephosphorylated ERK2 (MAP kinase 2/Erk 2, Millipore). The
phosphorylation of a ﬂuorescent-labeled peptide substrate
(FAM-Erktide, IPTTPITTTYFFFK-5FAM-COOH) by ERK2 was
quantiﬁed by using the IMAP FP Screening Express Kit (Molecular Devices).
Surface plasmon resonance
All of the biosensor experiments were carried out on the
Biacore 2000 or Biacore T100 systems (GE Healthcare) at 15 C
with a ﬂow rate of 30 mL/min. For direct binding experiments of
test compounds to MEK, His6-MEK1 was minimally biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-LC-LC biotin (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and
then coupled to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (GE Healthcare). Solutions of test compounds were injected over the
surface for 1 or 2 minutes and then the ﬂow was switched to
a running buffer: Tris-based saline [50 mmol/L tris(hyroxyethyl)carboxymethane-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10
mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% P-20,
and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)].
For direct binding assays of test compounds to RAF, Nterminal GST-tagged BRAF or CRAF was captured on the
surface of a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) by anti-GST
polyclonal antibodies that were pre-immobilized on the chip
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, 10 mmol/L
of test compound solutions in 1% DMSO were injected over the
prepared sensor chip. Phosphate-based saline (10 mmol/L
phosphate, pH 7.4, 138 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl, 10
mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.01% P-20, and 1% DMSO)
was used as a running buffer.
The effects of CH5126766 and PD0325901 on the BRAF- or
CRAF-MEK1 interactions were determined using single-cycle
kinetics due to the slow dissociation of His6-MEK1 from RAF.
In these experiments, His6-MEK1 solutions at concentrations
of 0.0256, 0.064, 0.16, 0.4, and 1 mmol/L, were injected sequentially in order of increasing concentration over the sensor chip
in the absence or presence of 3 mmol/L of the test compounds
and then the dissociation constants of His6-MEK1 were calculated for the immobilized BRAF or CRAF for each condition.
In these experiments, 500 mmol/L ATP was added to the
running buffer.
The resulting sensorgrams were double-referenced, DMSOcalibrated, and ﬁtted to determine kinetic parameters by using
SCRUBBER2 (BioLogics), BIAevaluation ver3.1, T100 evaluation ver2.0, or T200 evaluation ver1.0 (GE Healthcare) software.
Coimmunoprecipitation of MEK1 and BRAF
The 293H cells transfected with 2 mg FLAG-tagged full-length
ARAF, BRAF, CRAF, or BRAF V600E plasmid DNA (8) or
HCT116 cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO or MEK inhibitors
(50 nmol/L PD0325901 or 250 nmol/L CH5126766 in 0.1%
DMSO) for 1 hour (293H-transfected cells) or 2 hours (HCT116
cells). Cells were lysed in 1% NP40 lysis buffer (50 mmol/L TRIS,
pH 7.5, 150 nmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmol/L EDTA)
supplemented with 2.5 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 10

mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF), and protease
inhibitor cocktail (EMD). For immunoprecipitation of FLAGtagged RAF proteins, agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody
beads (Invitrogen) were added to precipitate FLAG-tagged
proteins. For immunoprecipitation of intact BRAF proteins,
Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) and anti-BRAF antibody
mixed were incubated with the cell lysate for immunoprecipitation for 1 hour at 4 C. Immunoprecipitations were washed 3
times in the lysis buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis.
Efﬁcacy experiments in mouse xenograft models
All in vivo studies were approved by the Chugai Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Female BALB-nu/nu mice
(CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/CrlCrlj nu/nu) were obtained from
Charles River Laboratories Japan and maintained under pathogen-free conditions. These mice were given access to standard mouse chow and water ad libitum. A total of 5  106
(HCT116) or 1  107 (Calu-6 and COLO205) tumor cells per
mouse were injected subcutaneously into the right ﬂank of the
7- to 9-week-old mice. When tumor volume reached to 200
mm3 (day 0), the mice were randomized and vehicle [5% DMSO
and 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (HPCD) solution in
distilled water], CH5126766 or PD0325901 was administered
orally once a day at the indicated doses. For the drug administration, CH5126766 was dissolved in distilled water containing 5% DMSO and 10% HPCD, and PD0325901 was dissolved in
distilled water containing 5% ethanol and 5% Cremophor EL.
Drugs were administrated at the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD). The MTD was deﬁned as the highest dose that produced less than 20% weight loss and no mortality. Tumor
growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated using the following
formula: TGI ¼ [1  (T  T0)/(C  C0)]  100, where T and T0
were the mean tumor volumes on a speciﬁc experimental day
and on the ﬁrst day of treatment, respectively, for the experimental groups and likewise, where C and C0 were the mean
tumor volumes for the control group. The value of the 50%
effective dose (ED50) for each compound was calculated on the
basis of the formula for the straight line that connected the 2
points for which y was equal to 50%. Each treatment group
included 4 to 6 animals. Statistical analysis was conducted by
using Dunnett test or Wilcoxon test with SAS version 8.02 (SAS
Institute). The criterion for statistical signiﬁcance was P < 0.05.

Results
Discovery of CH5126766 and its inhibition of ERK
signaling
CH5126766 (RO5126766; Fig. 1A) was obtained by iterative
rounds of derivatization of a hit compound from a cell-based
high-throughput screen for compounds that induce expression
of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 in tumor cells. CH5126766
induced p27Kip1 protein expression and caused G1 arrest in a
human lung large cell carcinoma cell line NCI-H460 (KRAS
Q61H) and 2 colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines, HT29 (BRAF
V600E) and HCT116 (KRAS G13D; Supplementary Fig. S1A and
S1B). We attempted to determine the target of the drug by
using the COMPARE drug screening algorithm (14), which
analyzes the pattern of antiproliferative activity obtained in a

4052

panel of tumor cell lines exposed to different agents. Among
the 21 antitumor agents tested, including CH5126766, antimetabolites (5-ﬂuorouracil, gemcitabine and methotrexate), a
DNA-damaging agent (cisplatin), a DNA intercalator (doxorubicin), an alkylating agent (mytomycin C), and inhibitors of
MEK (CI-1040, PD0325901, and AZD6244), EGFR (erlotinib),
Bcr-Abl (imatinib and dasatinib), multiple kinases (sorafenib
and sunitinib), HSP90 (geldanamycin), proteasome (bortezomib), mTOR (rapamycin), PI3K (LY294002), topoisomerase I
(camptothecin), and microtubules (paclitaxel), only MEK inhibitors were associated with a pattern of inhibition similar to
that obtained with CH5126766 (correlation coefﬁcients greater
than 0.8, Supplementary Table S1).
MEK is a component of the cascade of kinases responsible
for the activation of ERK signaling. To determine whether the
effects of the drug were due to inhibition of MEK or RAF, we
assessed its effects on their catalytic activity in cell-free kinase
assays (Fig. 1B). CH5126766 effectively inhibited activation of
ERK2 protein by MEK1 and the phosphorylation of MEK1
protein by the RAF family of enzymes. Thus, the drug inhibited
the activity of both RAF kinase and MEK kinase in the in vitro
biochemical assays. In a KINOMEscan panel with 256 kinases
(DiscoveRx) at 10 mmol/L, CH5126766 was suggested to bind to
CRAF (82% inhibition of an ATP analog binding) and BRAF
(89% inhibition of an ATP analog binding) but not to 254 other
kinases (Supplementary Table S2). Because the initial KINOMEscan panel did not include MEK1 and MEK2, we separately
conﬁrmed the binding of CH5126766 to MEK1 and MEK2 with
KINOMEscan proﬁling. The Kd for MEK1 and MEK2 was 2.9
and 13 nmol/L, respectively (Supplementary Table S2).
To examine whether the drug also inhibits these targets in
cells, we investigated the effect of CH5126766 on phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in tumor cells. HCT116 KRAS-mutant
colorectal cancer cells were treated with CH5126766 for 2
hours, and the phosphorylation status of MEK and ERK were
analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1C, CH5126766 reduced the levels of
phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK to undetectable levels,
whereas other MEK inhibitors PD0325901 and GSK1120212
only inhibited ERK phosphorylation. When HCT116 cells were
treated with either of 2 RAF inhibitors (GDC-0879 and PLX4720), phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was induced as
previously reported in response to paradoxical activation of
RAF kinase (Fig. 1C). Thus, the effects of CH5126766 on ERK
signaling in HCT116 were different from those of both MEK
inhibitors and RAF inhibitors.
The effects of CH5126766 on ERK signaling were further
assessed in a panel of tumor cells with or as a function of
genotype (RAS/RAF wt, BRAF V600E mutant, mutant RAS) and
compared with those obtained with PD0325901. In tumors
with RAS mutation, CH5126766 effectively inhibited both
MEK and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). This differs from
the effects of PD0325901, which inhibited ERK phosphorylation
and induced MEK phosphorylation in these cells (Fig. 1D).
CH5126766 also inhibited MEK and ERK phosphorylation
in mutant BRAF tumors as well as WT RAS/BRAF cells,
whereas the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 inhibited ERK phosphorylation in these cells and had no apparent effect on MEK
phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Thus, the effects of CH5126766 on

CH5126766 and 0.2 mmol/L PD0325901 was not additive with
that obtained with 0.2 mmol/L PD0325901 alone in our SPR
analysis (Fig. 2). Thus, we conclude that CH5126766 binds to
the known site of binding (15) of the allosteric inhibitors MEK
inhibitors such as PD0325901. In our biochemical MEK kinase
assay, CH5126766 did not inhibit the kinase activity of phosphorylated GST-MEK1 on S218 and S222 (Supplementary Fig.
S3). This suggests that phosphorylation of S218 and S222 is
critical for the afﬁnity of CH5126766 for MEK1. This is consistent with the previous observations that this region is
important for MEK1 binding of other allosteric MEK inhibitors
(16).
In contrast, SPR analyses revealed no evidence for binding of
CH5126766 to immobilized GST-BRAF or GST-CRAF (Fig. 3A).
These data suggest that the inhibition of His6-MEK1 K97R
phosphorylation by CH5126766 (Fig. 1B) is not due to a direct
interaction of the drug with RAF kinases. Indeed, when a
peptide substrate for RAF [MEKtide, corresponding to human
MEK1 212-224 and human MEK2 217-229 (SGQLIDSMANSFVNH2)] was substituted for the MEK1 protein as the substrate in
an in vitro assay of CRAF kinase activity, CH5126766 did not
affect the peptide phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Given these data, we concluded our initial evidence that
CH5126766 bound to RAF proteins in the KINOMEscan

ERK signaling in tumor cells and in cell-free kinase assays differ
from those obtained with other inhibitors of RAF or MEK and
are consistent with ﬁnding that it inhibits both kinases in vitro
assays.
Mechanism of inhibition of MEK and ERK
phosphorylation
It seemed unlikely, however, that the effects of CH5126766
are due to its selective and independent binding to 2 kinases,
RAF and MEK, one of which is required for the activation of the
other.
We therefore used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses to assess whether CH5126766 binds directly to MEK,
BRAF, or CRAF. Our SPR analyses with immobilized
His6-MEK1 showed that both CH5126766 and PD0325901 bind
to His6-MEK1 (Fig. 2). In the presence of 50 mmol/L ATP, the
binding signal of CH5126766 or PD0325901 to His6-MEK1 was
additive with that obtained with ATP alone. These data suggest
that CH5126766 does not compete with ATP for binding to His6
-MEK but that instead it binds to another site in the protein.
This is consistent with our data that the KD of CH5126766 for
His6-MEK1 are similar in the presence or absence of 50 mmol/L
ATP (16 and 6.1 nmol/L, respectively). Moreover, the binding
signal obtained with His6-MEK1 in the presence of 0.2 mmol/L

theoretical curves obtained by the global ﬁtting of the sensorgrams are also shown (thin lines). Single-cycle kinetics method was used for the analysis,
where 5 different concentrations of MEK1 were injected sequentially in order of increasing concentrations. Further details of these experiments are described
in Materials and Methods. C, interaction of MEK and RAF family proteins in the CH5126766-treated cells. 293H cells transfected with FLAG-tagged

proﬁling (Supplementary Table S2) was an artifact of the
extremely high concentration (10 mmol/L) of drug used in this
assay compared with the much lower concentrations of drug
required to inhibit MEK phosphorylation in cells (0.01 mmol/
L, Fig. 1C).
These results suggested the hypothesis that CH5126766
inhibits RAF kinase by binding to MEK1. To test this idea, we
used SPR to determine whether the drug alters the interaction
between RAF and MEK. CH5126766 decreased the dissociation
rate of His6-MEK1 from GST-BRAF (Fig. 3B and Supplementary
Table S4). We observed similar effects when we substituted
GST-CRAF for GST-BRAF. In contrast, PD0325901 had no effect
on the kinetics of dissociation of this protein complex. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation analysis with lysates of 293H
cells engineered to express FLAG-tagged RAF proteins showed
that CH5126766 causes MEK1/2 to interact with all 3 FLAGtagged RAF proteins, including FLAG-tagged BRAF V600E,
whereas PD0325901 causes MEK1/2 to interact with FLAGtagged wild-type ARAF and CRAF but not FLAG-tagged wildtype BRAF and mutant BRAF (Fig. 3C). Whereas considerable
MEK2 was immunoprecipitated with each of the FLAG-RAF
from lysates of cells treated with CH5126766, the relative
amount of MEK1 pulled down with FLAG wild-type BRAF was
much greater than that pulled down with FLAG-CRAF or
FLAG-BRAF V600E. Whether this reﬂects differences in afﬁnity
of MEK1 and MEK2 to the different RAF proteins has not yet
been addressed. Similar results were obtained when we used
KRAS-mutated HCT116 cells and immunoprecipitated endogenous BRAF. In the cells treated with CH5126766, MEK and
CRAF were coimmunoprecipitated with BRAF, whereas in the
DMSO- or PD0325901-treated cells, only CRAF was coimmunoprecipitated with BRAF (Fig. 3D). The results suggest that
CH5126766-bound MEK binds to and inhibits RAF kinase
activity. To assess this possibility, the ability of CRAF to
phosphorylate the MEKtide in an in vitro kinase assay was
evaluated in the presence or absence of unphosphorylated
His6-MEK1 proteins and MEK or RAF inhibitors (Fig. 3E). The
pan-RAF inhibitor PLX4720 inhibited CRAF activity whether or
not His6-MEK1 was present and PD0325901 did not inhibit the
phosphorylation of the MEKtide by CRAF kinase in either
circumstance. In contrast, CH5126766 inhibited CRAF activity
in a His6-MEK1–dependent manner (Fig. 3E). Moreover, the
inhibition of CRAF activity by CH5126766 was dependent on
the concentration of His6-MEK1. These results suggest that
binding of CH5126766 to MEK causes MEK to bind to and
inhibit RAF and inhibit its kinase activity. Taken together, the
data suggest a model in which the drug binds to MEK and
causes it to adopt a conformation in which it binds to RAF but
cannot be phosphorylated by and released from RAF. As a
consequence, CH5126766 causes MEK to become a dominant
negative inhibitor of RAF.
Inhibition of ERK signaling and tumor growth by
CH5126766 in KRAS tumors in vivo
MEK inhibitors have recently been shown to have antitumor
activity in patients with mutant BRAF melanoma and modest
activity in patients with melanomas with mutant NRAS tumors
(3, 10–12). It is possible that the feedback reactivation of RAF in

4056

Cancer Res; 73(13) July 1, 2013

response to MEK inhibition reduces the antitumor effects of
these drugs by limiting their inhibition of ERK signaling. If this
is the case, MEK inhibitors like CH5126766 that prevent
induction of MEK phosphorylation by activated RAF could
have enhanced antitumor activity in RAS tumors. To examine
this possibility, we compared the antitumor effects of
CH5126766 with those elicited by PD0325901 in an HCT116
(G13D KRAS) mouse xenograft model. In this experiment, we
administrated CH5126766 or PD0325901 at their MTD in the
HCT116 model (1.5 and 25 mg/kg, respectively). These doses
inhibited pERK and ERK signaling output at similar degrees in
the tumors from the drug-treated mice at 4 hours from the ﬁrst
drug administration (Fig. 4B). Moreover, in HCT116 models,
the ED50 for CH5126766 and PD0325901 were 0.056 and 0.80
mg/kg, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, the
doses used for this experiment were 26.8- and 31.3-fold higher
doses than the 50% effective doses, respectively. As shown
in Fig. 4A, daily oral administration of either drug caused
signiﬁcant tumor regression of each these tumors. However,
whereas inhibition of tumor growth was maintained for the
entire 28-day treatment period in CH5126766-treated mice,
tumor models receiving PD0325901 became refractory after 10
days of treatment. We observed similar differences between
CH5126766 and PD0325901 in Calu-6, an anaplastic lung
carcinoma model with Q61K mutant KRAS, but not in
COLO205, a colorectal adenocarcinoma model with V600E
mutant BRAF (Fig. 5A).
To assess whether differences in the extent of ERK pathway
inhibition could account for the difference in efﬁcacy of the 2
drugs, the tumors in Fig. 4A were resected 4 hours after the ﬁrst
dose or 4 hours after the last of 34 days of daily dosing of the
drug. In the PD0325901-treated tumors, MEK was highly
phosphorylated (Fig. 4B). Although pMEK was induced by
PD0325901 treatment, this was not associated with an
increased ERK phosphorylation, which was undetectable in
tumors treated with either drug even after multiple doses. It
has been recently shown that pERK is a less quantitative
measure of pathway activation than expression of ERK-dependent genes (17). Whereas the levels of protein expression of 4
such genes, MKP2, MKP3, SPRY2, and SPRY4, were undetectable
in tumors treated with CH5126766, substantial levels of SPRY2
and 4 and MKP3 were detected in the PD0325901-treated
tumors after multiple dosing. These differences were not
observed 4 hours after the initial dose of these inhibitors.
Similar effects were observed in CH5126766-treated Calu-6
tumors with Q61K KRAS, whereas no downstream activation of
ERK signaling was noted in PD0325901-treated COLO205
tumors with V600E BRAF even after multiple dosing (Fig.
5B). The results suggest that CH5126766 is a more effective
inhibitor of ERK signaling output than PD0325901 in chronically treated tumors with RAS mutations.
We also examined whether the refractory tumors from the
PD0325901-treated mice would respond to CH5126766. The
tumors that became refractory to PD0325901 were treated
daily with either PD0325901 or CH5126766. As shown in Fig. 4C,
the growth of the refractory tumors ceased in the CH5126766treated group but continued to increase in the PD0325901treated group. These data suggest that resistance of these

The elevation of ERK output in tumors with RAS or BRAF
mutation and the sensitivity of such tumors to inhibitors of
components of the pathway suggest that this may be a useful
therapeutic strategy. RAF inhibitors selectively inhibit ERK
activation in tumor cells with certain BRAF mutants that
function as monomers. In other tumors, RAF inhibitors bind
to and transactivate RAF dimers and ERK signaling (8). Thus,
RAF inhibitors only effectively suppress ERK signaling in
tumors in which the target is mutated, so they have a wider
therapeutic index than MEK inhibitors. These drugs have
remarkable clinical activity in melanomas with V600E BRAF
mutation but they cannot be used to treat tumors in which the
pathway is driven by other oncoproteins. Of note, antitumor
activity in tumors with mutant BRAF requires very substantial
(>80%) inhibition of ERK output (18).
As opposed to RAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors inhibit ERK
signaling in all normal and tumor cells. They can therefore
be used to treat RAS tumors. However, these drugs have

noted in PD0325901-treated tumors and that the more prolonged growth inhibition with CH5126766 is due to more
effective inhibition of the pathway.

only marginal therapeutic effects in patients with these tumors
(10–12). RAS has been shown to activate more than 10 effectors
in model systems, of which 3—RAF, PI3K, RAL-GDS—have
been most strongly shown to mediate important aspects of
transformation (19). It is possible that inhibition of RAF/MEK/
ERK signaling alone is insufﬁcient to markedly affect transformation. It has been shown, however, that the development
of KRAS mutant–induced lung cancer in genetically engineered mice requires c-RAF (20). Because the dosage of MEK
inhibitor is limited by toxicity, it is also possible that not
enough can be administered to inhibit the pathway enough
to signiﬁcantly affect tumor growth.
Relief of ERK-dependent feedback inhibition of signaling
may prevent maximal inhibition of pathway output by MEK
inhibitors. Activation of ERK in cells is limited by ERK-dependent feedback inhibition of multiple upstream targets in the
pathway and by ERK-dependent expression of the ERK phosphatases (MKPs) and SPRY family of proteins (21–25). In
particular, activated ERK phosphorylates and inhibits CRAF
kinase. Inhibition of ERK signaling by MEK inhibitors relieves
ERK-dependent feedback inhibition of CRAF and induces MEK
phosphorylation in most cells (26, 27). It is conceivable that
phosphorylation of these sites (MEK S218 and S222) by RAF
could reduce inhibition of MEK activity by the drug and reduce

This idea is consistent with our observations that feedback
reactivation of RAF by conventional allosteric MEK inhibitors
is more pronounced in cells with activated RAS in cells with
mutant BRAF mutants or wild-type RAS and BRAF (Fig. 1D;
ref. 17).
We now report the generation of a novel allosteric MEK
inhibitor, CH5126766, that does not cause induction of MEK
phosphorylation, despite its potent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. This compound and PD0325901 compete for
binding to the same site on MEK1 (Fig. 2) to which they bind
with similar afﬁnity (KD for CH5126766 and PD0325901: 4.5 and

ever, as opposed to PD0325901 and other MEK inhibitors,
CH5126766 inhibits, rather than induces MEK phosphorylation
(Fig. 1C and D), a result that suggests that it directly inhibits
RAF activity. This turns out to be the case but only when fulllength MEK is present in the RAF kinase assay. Furthermore,
the drug does not directly bind to RAF (Fig. 3A).
The effects of the drug are explained by the demonstration
that it causes MEK to bind to RAF. In this complex, the drugbound MEK is not phosphorylated and its dissociation rate
from RAF is much reduced compared with that of unbound
MEK or MEK bound to PD0325901 (Fig. 3B–D). The dissociation of MEK protein from immobilized RAF protein was
retarded by CH5126766: koff value was changed with a 2-order

A Novel MEK Inhibitor Prevents Feedback Activation of RAF

MEK1) and from 1.58  102 to 1.62  104 (CRAF-MEK1) by
adding CH5126766. But it had no effect on the association of
MEK with RAF: kon value was almost unchanged from 2.25 
105 to 1.2  105 (BRAF-MEK1) and from 3.46  105 to 2.39  105
(CRAF-MEK1) by adding CH5126766 (Supplementary Table
S4). Thus, MEK bound to CH5126766 is a dominant-negative
inhibitor of RAF. This is consistent with a model in which the
binding of the drug to MEK causes the latter to adopt a
conformation in which it cannot be phosphorylated by RAF.
CH5126766 preferentially binds to nonphosphorylated
MEK1 rather than phosphorylated MEK1 in our cell-free MEK
kinase assay (Supplementary Fig. S3). Our current data strongly
suggests that CH5126766 only binds to the unphosphorylated
enzyme, inhibits it, and prevents its phosphorylation. It does
not inhibit the phosphorylated enzyme well but rather traps
the unphosphorylated enzyme so it cannot be phosphorylated.
This is why the afﬁnity for the unphosphorylated enzyme is
high (KINOMEscan and SPR assays) and the drug is a potent
inhibitor of MEK phosphorylation (RAF kinase in cells) but a
less potent inhibitor of phosphorylated MEK in a kinase assay
(Fig. 1B). Because the coimmunoprecipitated MEK proteins
with RAF proteins were not phosphorylated (Fig. 3C), it was
suggested that phosphorylation of MEK causes its dissociation
from RAF. From these lines of evidence, we speculate that the
drug binds selectively to the nonphosphorylated form of MEK,
locks it into the unphosphorylated conformation, and stabilizes MEK/RAF complex, The RAF/MEK drug bound complex
is inactive and stable, thus the drug suppresses the feedback
induction of MEK phosphorylation that occurs after ERK
pathway inhibition in tumors exposed to other MEK inhibitors
(Fig. 1C and D). The cellular effects of CH5126766 thus appear
to be those of a combined MEK and RAF inhibitor. Despite
inhibition of RAF by CH5126766, it does not induce paradoxical
activation of RAF kinases in cells in which active RAF is a dimer
because it does not bind to RAF directly.
Because CH5126766 suppresses induction of MEK phosphorylation, it can be used to determine whether feedback
reactivation of RAF reduces ERK inhibition by inhibitors such
as PD0325901. Indeed, CH5126766 effectively inhibited ERK
phosphorylation in vivo in RAS-mutant xenografts and was a
more potent inhibitor of ERK output and tumor growth than
PD0325901 (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). These data suggest but do not
prove that preventing induction of pMEK accounts for the
greater efﬁcacy of this drug.
GSK1120212 (trametinib, JTP-74057), another MEK inhibitor, has signiﬁcant therapeutic efﬁcacy in patients with melanomas with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation (3) as well as in
some RAS tumors (10). GSK1120212 was identiﬁed from a
screen similar to the one from which CH5126766 was obtained,
in this case, picking compounds that induced p15 expression
(29, 30). This agent binds to the same site in MEK proteins as

PD0325901 with higher afﬁnity to MEK1 than PD0325901 (30)
and induces phosphorylation of S222 but not S218 MEK1. In
KRAS-mutated cells, however, phosphorylation of MEK S222
was increased, although phosphorylation of S218 MEK1 was
prevented (16). It is possible that the signiﬁcant clinical activity
of this drug is due, in part, to partial suppression of feedback
reactivation of ERK. As a class, such MEK inhibitors may offer
the chance for enhanced pathway output inhibition and antitumor activity without necessarily increasing toxicity.
In the phase I clinical investigation of CH5126766, 2 partial
responses in BRAF V600E melanoma and in one Q61K NRASmutated patient with melanoma were reported (12). However,
the long plasma half-life of CH5126766 in human (60 hours),
and its continuous daily dosing were associated with a severe
rash (12). Further progress in the use of the drugs to potently
inhibit ERK signaling in tumors will require identiﬁcation of
the optimal doses and administration schedules to maximize
inhibition of signaling and antitumor activity without unacceptable toxicity.
