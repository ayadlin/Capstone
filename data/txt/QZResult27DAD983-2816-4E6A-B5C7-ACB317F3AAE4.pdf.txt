ABSTRACT
The androgen receptor (AR) is a driver of prostate cancer (PCa) cell growth and
disease progression. Therapies for advanced PCa exploit AR dependence by blocking
the production or action of androgens, but these interventions inevitably fail via
multiple mechanisms including mutation or deletion of the AR ligand binding domain
(LBD). Thus, the development of new inhibitors which act through non-LBD interfaces
is an unmet clinical need. EPI-001 is a bisphenol A-derived compound shown to bind
covalently and inhibit the AR NH2-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we demonstrate that
EPI-001 has general thiol alkylating activity, resulting in multilevel inhibitory effects
on AR in PCa cell lines and tissues. At least one secondary mechanism of action
associated with AR inhibition was found to be selective modulation of peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). These multi-level effects of EPI-001
resulted in inhibition of transcriptional activation units (TAUs) 1 and 5 of the AR
NTD, and reduced AR expression. EPI-001 inhibited growth of AR-positive and ARnegative PCa cell lines, with the highest sensitivity observed in LNCaP cells. Overall,
this study provides new mechanistic insights to the chemical biology of EPI-001,
and raises key issues regarding the use of covalent inhibitors of the intrinsically
unstructured AR NTD.

of molecular mechanisms [5]. Importantly, castrationresistant PCa (CRPC) tumors remain AR-dependent, as
evidenced by the increased overall survival of patients
treated with the second-generation androgen deprivation
therapies enzalutamide [6–8] and abiraterone [9]. Despite
these advances, resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone is
frequent and several AR re-activation mechanisms have been
reported as likely drivers [10–14]. Therefore, development
of novel AR-targeted therapeutics that are active in CRPC
remains an important area of investigation [15].

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly
diagnosed male cancer in the US with approximately
233,000 new cases and 30,000 deaths predicted in 2014
[1]. Normal and cancerous prostate tissues are dependent
on activation of the androgen receptor (AR) to support
cell proliferation and survival [2, 3]. Thus, inhibiting AR
activation serves as the basis for treating metastatic disease
[4]. However, these therapies ultimately fail via a variety

The AR is a modular steroid hormone receptor
transcription factor with the primary transcriptional
activation function mapping to Transcriptional Activation
Units (TAU)1 and TAU5 in the intrinsically unstructured
AR NH2-terminal domain (NTD) [16, 17]. The functional
importance of these domains is evidenced by the expres­
sion of AR splice variant proteins in CRPC, which are
constitutively active AR species composed of the AR NTD
and central DNA binding domain (DBD), but lacking the
regulatory LBD [18, 19]. This highlights the clinical need
for new therapeutics that exert action through non-LBD
interfaces on the AR protein [18, 19]. EPI-001, a Bisphenol
A diglicycyl ether (BADGE) derivative, was identified
as a specific inhibitor of the AR that bound covalently
to an undetermined structural motif in the AR NTD and
inhibited the growth of androgen sensitive PCa and CRPC
cells in vitro and in vivo [20, 21]. Here, we interrogated the
mechanism by which EPI-001 inhibits the AR NTD. We
show that EPI-001 is a general thiol modifier with myriad
effects on AR expression and activity, and selectively
modulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma (PPARγ) activity. Overall, this study provides novel
insights to EPI-001 chemical biology that will be critical
for ongoing development of AR NTD inhibitors.

residual androgen-independent ARGal4 transcriptional
activity in C4-2 cells remained responsive to EPI-001
(Figure 1D). To test the responsiveness of discrete AR
TAUs to EPI-001 directly, we tethered the entire AR NTD,
or TAU1 or TAU5 fragments to the Gal4 DBD (Figure 1B,
constructs 5–7). In all cell lines tested, EPI-001 inhibited
transcriptional activity of the NTD-Gal4 hybrid (Figures
1E, 1F, and Supplementary Figure S5). The Gal4-TAU1
and Gal4-TAU5 fusion proteins displayed cell line-specific
transcriptional activity, likely due to inefficient expression
in PCa cell lines (Figures 1E, 1F, and Supplementary
Figure S5). In 293T fibroblasts, transcriptional activity
of the Gal4-TAU1 and –TAU5 constructs was potently
inhibited by EPI-001 (Figures 1E and 1F). These data agree
with previous reports of direct AR inhibition by EPI-001,
but extend this knowledge by demonstrating the effects
could not be mapped to a discrete AR TAU. This indicates
two possible scenarios: 1) EPI-001 binds specifically to
both TAU1 and TAU5, or 2) EPI-001 has a more general
effect on transcriptional activities of TAU1 and TAU5.

EPI-001 inhibits endogenous AR mRNA and
protein expression
Interestingly, we observed that endogenous AR
protein levels were consistently repressed in PCa cell
lines treated with EPI-001 (Figure 1C). To explore
this phenomenon, we tested the effect of EPI-001 on
AR protein levels in a panel of androgen sensitive PCa
(Figure 2A) and CRPC (Figure 2B) cell lines. In these
cell lines, EPI-001 treatment decreased expression of fulllength AR protein to varying degrees (Figures 2A and
2B). AR protein loss occurred between 8 and 16 hours
of treatment and was independent of the proteasome
(Supplementary Figure S6). In line with this, AR mRNA
expression in LNCaP and C4-2 cells was reduced in
response to EPI-001 at time points preceding the observed
decreases in AR protein expression (Figure 2C). EPI-001
also inhibited the mRNA expression of AR and the AR
target gene PSA in LAPC4 cells (Supplementary Figure
S7A). EPI-001 treatment also decreased expression
of truncated AR variant (AR-v) proteins expressed in
the CRPC 22Rv1 cell line (Figure 2B). Interestingly,
AR mRNA (Supplementary Figure S7B) and protein
expression (Figure 2B) in CWR-R1 cells did not respond
to EPI-001, nor did EPI-001 inhibit the expression of the
AR target gene FKBP5 (Supplementary Figure S7B).
To test if the effects of EPI-001 on AR expression
were due to decreased AR mRNA stability, we treated
LNCaP with Actinomycin D alone or in combination with
EPI-001. Treatment with EPI-001 did not accelerate AR
mRNA decay following transcriptional blockade with
Actinomycin D (Supplementary Figure S8). Consistent
with this, we found that 50 μM EPI-001 reduced the rate of
nascent AR mRNA synthesis in LNCaP cells (Figure 2D).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that EPI-001 inhibits
transcription of the AR gene.

RESULTS
EPI-001 inhibits transcriptional activity of both
AR TAU1 and TAU5
LNCaP cells were treated with a range of EPI-001
concentrations to identify doses that effectively inhibited
AR-responsive luciferase reporters. Contrary to previous
reports showing that 10 μM EPI-001 achieved robust
AR inhibition [20], we observed that a 50 μM dose
was required (Supplementary Figure S4). To identify
the specific AR TAU through which 50 μM EPI-001
inhibited AR activity, we performed promoter tethering
assays with an ARGal4 hybrid wherein the AR DBD had
been replaced with the yeast Gal4 DBD (Figure 1A,
construct 2). As a negative control, we used bisphenol
A bis[2,3-dihydroxypropyl] ether (BABDHE), as it is
structurally similar to EPI-001 but contains a diol instead
of a reactive chlorohydrin (Figure 1B) [21]. EPI-001
inhibited ligand-dependent ARGal4 transcriptional activity
in LNCaP cells (Figures 1C and 1D), as well as aberrant,
ligand-independent ARGal4 transcriptional activity in the
CRPC C4-2 cell line (Figure 1D). Deletion of TAU5 from
ARGal4 increased androgen-dependent ARGal4 activity and
decreased androgen-independent ARGal4 activity, consistent
with previous reports [22], but this deletion did not affect
responsiveness to EPI-001 (Figure 1D). Conversely,
deletion of TAU1 decreased androgen-dependent and
–independent modes of ARGal4 transcriptional activity
in LNCaP and C4-2 cells (Figure 1D). This precluded
evaluation of EPI-001 effects on TAU1 in LNCaP, but

that inhibited expression of AR or AR-V protein levels
(Figure 3B). BABDHE also inhibited PCa and CRPC
growth and AR expression, although higher doses were
required than for EPI-001 (Supplementary Figure S10A
& 10B), indicating the EPI-001 chlorohydrin moiety is
important for inhibition of AR expression. Surprisingly,
EPI-001 also inhibited growth of AR-negative PC-3
and DU 145 cell lines (Figure 3C), as well as the T47D

Based on these findings, we reasoned that
inhibition of AR synthesis could be an important
component of the EPI-001 anti-AR mechanism. EPI-001

EPI-001 action in PCa cells is similar
to the PPARγ agonist, troglitazone

of AR transcriptional activity in promoter reporter assays
in LNCaP cells (Figure 4A) at doses that correlated
with inhibition of AR protein expression (Figure 4B).
Furthermore, treatment of LNCaP cells with troglitazone
or EPI-001 resulted in dose-dependent reduction of
AR protein levels as well as induction of p21 and p27
(Figure 4B). Troglitazone inhibited AR expression at lower
doses than observed in prior studies [28, 30], which may
be due to the absence of serum in the cell culture medium
during drug treatment in our study. Finally, troglitazone
treatment also inhibited the activity of ARGal4, as well as
the Gal4-tethered AR NTD, TAU1, and TAU5 (Figure 4C),
analogous to the effect of EPI-001 in these models (Figures
1D and 1F).

Bisphenol A Diglycidyl Ether (BADGE), which
is related structurally to EPI-001 but contains a bisepoxide, has been shown to act as a selective PPARγ
modulator (SPPARM) with diverse effects in different cell
types [23–25]. Given that PPARγ has also been shown
to play a role in prostate development and maintenance
[26], and PPARγ agonists such as troglitazone have been
demonstrated to inhibit AR expression and PCa cell growth
in vitro and in vivo [27–29], we reasoned that PPARγ
modulation may be an unanticipated activity of EPI-001 in
PCa cells. Indeed, troglitazone or EPI-001 caused inhibition

To expand these observations to clinical disease,
we treated fresh human PCa tissue maintained as explants
[31–33] with troglitazone and EPI-001 (Figure 5A). The
doses of EPI-001 and troglitazone used in this model were
increased 2- to 4-fold relative to in vitro experiments to
reflect the higher doses of drug that have been used for
in vivo [21] or ex vivo [34] experimentation. Importantly,
both EPI-001 and troglitazone effected decreases in AR
protein, AR mRNA, and AR target gene expression in PCa

reporter in LNCaP cells (Figure 6A). This SPPARM
activity was AR-independent, as troglitazone and EPI001 both induced mRNA expression of the PPARγ targets
CIDEC [35], TXNIP [30], and PDK4 [26] in the ARnull PC-3 cell line [27] (Figure 6B). However, in 3T3L1 cells that had been differentiated to PPARγ-positive
adipocytes, EPI-001 repressed expression of classical
PPARγ target genes aP2 and LPL (Supplementary
Figure S12A) and inhibited lipid droplet formation
(Supplementary Figure S12B). These effects are
consistent with previous reports of BADGE-mediated
repression of PPARγ activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes
at micromolar concentrations [23]. Taken together,
these cell type-specific PPARγ agonist/antagonist
effects support a SPPARM function for EPI-001, with
thiazolidinedione-like effects on PPARγ activity in
PCa cells.

To investigate the relationship between EPI-001mediated PPARγ activation and AR inhibition, we
knocked down PPARγ with siRNA in LNCaP cells.
Despite effective silencing of PPARγ expression, both
troglitazone and EPI-001 maintained robust inhibition
of AR protein expression (Supplementary Figure S13A).
This finding is consistent with a previous study showing
that troglitazone-mediated inhibition of AR expression is
due to PPARγ-independent degradation of the transcription
factor Sp1 [28]. However, EPI-001 had no effect on Sp1
levels (Supplementary Figure 13B). Conversely, siRNAmediated knock down of PPARγ partially rescued the
inhibition of AR transcriptional activity effected by EPI001, but not troglitazone (Figure 6C), demonstrating
that PPARγ participates in EPI-001-mediated inhibition
of AR transcriptional activity, but not inhibition of AR
expression.

solution [38], resulting in hydroxylated and halogenated
derivatives, of which EPI-001 (BADGE.HCl.H2O) is
one example [39]. Chlorohydrin moieties also have the
potential to spontaneously interconvert to epoxides in
aqueous solution [40]. Therefore, we used HPLC to
interrogate whether EPI-001 can convert to a BADGE-like
mono-epoxide in solution (Compound 2, Supplementary
Figure S2). Indeed, the epoxide was observed after 12h
incubation at neutral and basic pH (Figure 7A and 7B),
but not under acidic conditions (Supplementary Figure
S14A & S14B). The identity of compound 2 was
confirmed by co-injection with an authentic standard and
LC-MS analysis (Supplementary Figure S15). BADGE
has been shown to react with nucleophilic side chains
of food proteins in plastic-lined cans [41], which is the
same reaction proposed for the specific AR-binding
mechanism of EPI-001 [21]. In a previous study, nonspecific reactivity of EPI-001 with nucleophilic thiols was
not observed [21]. However, given our observation that
EPI-001 spontaneously converts to the epoxide at
neutral and basic pH, and that BADGE is reactive to
nucleophiles, we queried reactivity of EPI-001 with the
nucleophilic thiols glutathione, 2-mercaptoethanol, and
cysteamine at various pH conditions (Figure 7C). No EPI001:thiol adducts were formed under acidic conditions
(Supplementary Figure S16A & S16B, and Supplementary
Figure S17). However, reaction of EPI-001 with glutathione
resulted in a trace amount of thiol adduct formation at pH

EPI-001 forms covalent adducts with
thiols in vitro
Because SPPARM activity did not fully account for
the multi-level anti-AR effects of EPI-001, we considered
the fact that Bisphenol A (BPA) and BADGE are endocrine
disruptors used in the production of polycarbonate plastics
and epoxy resins [36, 37]. The epoxide rings in BADGE
and related compounds readily undergo hydrolysis and

DISCUSSION

7.4, and nearly complete conversion to the glutathione
adduct at pH 9.4 after 12 hours (Figure 7D). Similarly,
2-mercaptoethanol displayed limited adduct formation
at neutral pH, but underwent complete conversion to the
EPI-001:thiol adduct at basic pH (Figure 7D). Finally,
EPI-001 did not react with cysteamine at pH 7.4, but
displayed nearly complete adduct formation at pH 9.4
(Figure 7D). All EPI-001-thiol adducts were confirmed
by mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figure S18A–
S18C). Additionally, the monoepoxide, compound 2,
formed adducts with all thiols examined and displayed an
enhanced reactivity profile overall (Supplementary Figure
S19A–S19C). Collectively, these data indicate that EPI001 spontaneously converts to the more reactive epoxide
in solution at neutral and basic pH. Furthermore, EPI-001
extensively alkylates thiols under basic conditions with
appreciable amounts of EPI-001:thiol adducts observed
at neutral (7.4) pH. Our results suggest that EPI-001 is a
reactive electrophile which may display some selectivity
in modulation of proteins by virtue of local pH influence.

In this study, we describe unanticipated multilevel effects of EPI-001 on the AR and PPARγ pathways,
leading to inhibition of cell growth. In previous reports,
EPI-001 was shown to bind specifically to the AR NTD
through a nucleophilic substitution reaction with the
EPI-001 chlorohydrin group [21], thereby inhibiting AR
activity via occlusion of an unidentified CBP binding
domain [20]. We were unable to nominate a discrete AR
NTD motif that could account for a specific mechanism
of EPI-001-mediated AR transcriptional repression in
this study. Conversely, we found that EPI-001 inhibited
synthesis of AR in PCa cell lines and clinical tissues at
doses that corresponded with the inhibition of AR target
genes and PCa cell growth. The LNCaP cell line was
an exception to this general dose relationship between
AR expression inhibition and cell growth inhibition,
displaying the highest sensitivity to EPI-001- and
BABDHE-mediated growth inhibition. This is important,

as the majority of pre-clinical data supporting the efficacy
and specificity of EPI-001 for AR has been generated
using the LNCaP model [20, 21]. Moreover, we found that
EPI-001 inhibited the growth of AR-negative PC-3 and
DU 145 cells. These data conflict with a previous report
[20], but we propose that this discrepancy is due to two
key differences in experimental design. First, our study
incorporated longer-term (i.e. 7 day) growth assays as
opposed to early timepoint (i.e. 3 day) BrdU incorporation
readouts. Secondly, previous reports used 10 μM EPI001 to treat PC-3 and DU 145, a dose which was not
inhibitory to the growth of PC-3 and DU 145 in our study,
but inhibitory LNCaP cells. These data highlight the cell
line-specific responses to EPI-001, which supported earlier
conclusions of AR specificity.
Our data indicate that PPARγ activation represents
at least one AR-independent activity of EPI-001 in PCa
cells. However, EPI-001 displayed PPARγ inhibitory
activity in a classical 3T3-L1 adipocyte model, indicating
SPPARM activity as opposed to pure agonist activity.
SPPARM activity for EPI-001 is consistent with studies
demonstrating that the chemically-related compound,
BADGE, is a SPPARM that binds to the PPARγ LBD
[23] and exhibits distinct molecular effects in PCa and
3T3-L1 cells when compared with synthetic thiazoli­
dinedione PPARγ agonists [23–25] including troglitazone
[36–38]. Furthermore, our data from thiol reactivity
assays demonstrate that small molecule thiolates (e.g.,
glutathione, 2-mercaptoethanol, cysteamine) are readily
alkylated by EPI-001 and this reactivity is attenuated at
acid and neutral pH. Consequently, our data suggest that
any protein bearing an accessible nucleophilic residue
within a suitably basic binding pocket may be a target
for covalent modification by EPI-001. This is further
supported by the established reactivity of BADGE
in vitro [41], and our data that EPI-001 is converted
to an analogous epoxide (compound 2) in solution at
physiological pH. Collectively, these data suggest EPI001 and BADGE bear substantial proteome reactivity
features in addition to their reported interactions with AR
and PPARγ.
These new data indicate that structural changes
to the core bisphenol of EPI-001 as well as the
covalent warhead may be required to mitigate the ARindependent effects reported in this study and in the
toxicology literature [36–38, 41, 42]. However, this task
is complicated because no 3-dimensional structure has
been reported for the intrinsically disordered AR NTD
[43, 44], which impedes the rational design of improved
inhibitors. Nevertheless, EPI-002, the (2R, 20S) isomer of
racemic EPI-001, has been shown to display stronger AR
interactions and reduced toxicity in mice [21], indicating
this direction may be feasible. Our findings that EPI001-mediated inhibition of AR activity is associated with
inhibition of AR expression and activation of PPARγ in
PCa, coupled with the finding that EPI-001 can capture

nucleophilic thiols, will be important for ongoing
pre-clinical development of EPI-001 and other anti-AR
compounds that target functional domains independent of
the AR LBD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and growth assays
LNCaP, C4-2, DU 145, VCaP, 22Rv1, 293T, and
PC-3 cell lines were obtained from ATCC. The ATCC
validates the authenticity of these cell lines via short
tandem repeat (STR) analysis. CWR-R1 prostate cancer
cells were the generous gift of Dr. Elizabeth Wilson
(University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill,
NC). CWR-R1 cells were authenticated by sequencebased validation of two characteristic AR mutations:
a H874Y mutation in the LBD, and a 50 kb deletion in
AR intron 1 [45]. VCaP and 293T were maintained in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 10%
FBS. All other cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640
medium with 10% FBS, and all cell lines were maintained
in 100 Units/mL Penicillin + 0.1 mg/mL Streptomycin.
Cells were cultured in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 for
no longer than 15 passages after resuscitation of frozen
stocks. Cell growth was assessed by crystal violet staining
as previously described [46].

Reagents
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), mibolerone (MIB),
and BABDHE (Bisphenol A bis [2,3-dihydroxypropyl]
ether) were purchased from Sigma. Enzalutamide (ENZ)
was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Troglitazone was
purchased from Cayman Chemical. EPI-001 (Bisphenol
A [3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl] [2,3-dihydroxypropyl]
ether) was synthesized (See Supplementary Methods)
or purchased from commercial sources (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology or Sigma-Aldrich). EPI-001 was analyzed
for purity via HPLC and NMR (Supplementary Methods,
Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). EPI-001 dissolved
in DMSO was used for all experiments (Supplementary
Methods, Supplementary Figure S3). All other drugs were
suspended in DMSO with the exception of DHT, MIB,
and ENZ, which were prepared in absolute ethanol. Final
DMSO or ethanol concentrations did not exceed 0.1%
(v/v) in culture medium.

Plasmids
Plasmids encoding human AR (p5HBhAR-A),
ARGal4, NTD-Gal4, ARGal4∆TAU1, ARGal4∆TAU5, sPSALuciferase (also referred to as PSAenh(ARE)-LUC), and
sPSAGal4-Luciferase (also referred to as PSAenh(GAL4)LUC) have been described [22]. SV40-Renilla, CMVRenilla, and pG5-Luciferase were purchased from
3820

Oncotarget

pH stability and thiol reactivity studies

Promega. PPREx3-TK-Luciferase has been described
[47], and was obtained from Addgene. The Gal4 DBD
expression plasmid (pM) was purchased from Clontech.
Gal4-TAU1 (AR a.a. 101–360) and Gal4-TAU5 (AR
a.a. 361–490) were constructed as described in the
Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1.

Solutions of reduced l-glutathione, 2-mercaptoethanol,
and cysteamine in phosphate buffered saline were
adjusted to the desired pH (2.4, 7.4, or 9.4). EPI-001
or monoepoxide control (Compound 2, Supplementary
Figure S2) were added to thiol solutions and aliquots
of reactions were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC and
LC-MS at the indicated time points. To quantify the amount
of parent compound remaining, the area under the curve
(AUC) of the parent compound was divided by the AUC
of an internal standard. Further information regarding thiol
reactivity, HPLC, and LC-MS conditions are included in the
Supplementary Methods.

Cell transfection
LNCaP cells were transfected via single-pulse
electroporation as previously described [48]. C4-2
cells were transfected with Superfect reagent (Qiagen)
according to manufacturer specifications. 293T cells were
transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies)
according to manufacturer specifications. Treatment
of transfected cells with androgen and/or drug was
performed for 8 hours or overnight in serum-free medium
as indicated.

Data analysis and statistics
All statistical comparisons were made using the
two-tailed Student’s t-Test with a P value of 0.05 or less
considered significant.

Dual luciferase assays
Transfected cells were lysed in 1X Passive Lysis
Buffer (Promega) and subjected to dual luciferase
assays using a Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) as
previously described [48].
