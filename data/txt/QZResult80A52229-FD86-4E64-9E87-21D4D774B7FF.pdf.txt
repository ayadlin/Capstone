ABSTRACT
Activation of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAchR) is regulated
by prion protein (PrPC) expression and has a neuroprotective effect by modulating
autophagic flux. In this study, we hypothesized that PrPC may regulate α7nAchR
activation and that may prevent prion-related neurodegenerative diseases by
regulating autophagic flux. PrP(106-126) treatment decreased α7nAchR expression
and activation of autophagic flux. In addition, the α7nAchR activator PNU-282987
enhanced autophagic flux and protected neuron cells against PrP(106-126)-induced
apoptosis. However, activation of autophagy and the protective effects of PNU-282987
were inhibited in PrPC knockout hippocampal neuron cells. In addition, PrPC knockout
hippocampal neuron cells showed decreased α7nAchR expression levels. Adenoviral
overexpression of PrPC in PrPC knockout hippocampal neuron cells resulted in
activation of autophagic flux and inhibition of prion peptide-mediated cell death via
α7nAchR activation. This is the first report demonstrating that activation of α7nAchRmediated autophagic flux is regulated by PrPC, and that activation of α7nAchR
regulated by PrPC expression may play a pivotal role in protection of neuron cells
against prion peptide-induced neuron cell death by autophagy. These results suggest
that α7nAchR-mediated autophagic flux may be involved in the pathogenesis of prionrelated diseases and may be a therapeutic target for prion-related neurodegenerative
diseases.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s diseases [10-13]. Hung
et al. found that autophagy-mediated amyloid beta (Aβ)
clearance is regulated by activation of α7nAchR in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells [13]. Another study showed
that some α7nAchR agonists (AQW051 and PNU-282987)
protects the brain from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism [10,
14]. In addition, α7 nAChR antagonist, methyllycaconitine
blocked the nicotine-mediated neuroprotective effect
in differentiated PC-12 cells [15]. These data suggest
that activation of α7nAchR is regulated by PrPC
expression and may have a neuroprotective effect against
neurodegenerative disorders by interacting with PrPC
signals.
PrPC is normal prion protein distributed in various

Alpha-7
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptors
(α7nAchR), also known as α7 nicotinic receptors,
are a family of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that
regulate long-term memory and consist entirely of α7
subunits [1-3]. This receptor is distributed in the brain,
endothelium, muscle and lymphocytes [2, 4-6]. α7nAchR
are activated by post- and pre-synaptic excitation, mainly
by increased calcium permeability [7, 8]. Recent work
suggests that activation of these receptors is regulated
by stress-inducible protein 1 through cellular prion
protein (PrPC) signals [9]. In addition, activation of
α7nAchR has a neuroprotective effect against misfolded
protein-mediated neurodegenerative diseases, including

tissues, including the lung, intestinal tract, and brain and is
a glycosylated-phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane
protein involved with regulating neurosignals [16-20].
One study showed that PrPC may influence autophagic
flux, although the molecular mechanisms are unclear
[21]. Oh et al. suggested that PrPC protects hippocampal
neuron cells against autophagic cell death caused by
serum deprivation in PrnP−/− hippocampal neuron cells
[21]. Additionally, knockdown of PrPC expression in
various cancer cells increases autophagy-mediated cell
death [22]. However, one study suggested that PrPC
has a neuroprotective effect associated with induction
of autophagy against oxidative stress in hippocampal
neuron cells [23]. Moreover, Shin et al. found that the
increase of autophagic flux caused by depletion of PrPC
is correlated with age in the hippocampus compared to
that in normal mice [24]. The same study suggested
that a PrPC deficiency may disrupt autophagic flux by
blocking autophagosome-lysosomal fusion [24]. These
results suggest that PrPC is a key factor in the regulation
of autophagic flux in the brain, although the relationship
between PrPC and autophagic flux is unclear.
Autophagy is well known process for degrading
cytoplasmic components via the lysosomal pathway
[25-28]. During autophagy, LC3-I (cytosolic form)
is conjugated to PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) and
form LC3-II (LC3-PE conjugated form) [29, 30]. It is
composited to autophagosomal membranes, and which is
degraded by lysosomal digestion after the fusion of Avs
(autophagic vacuoles) with lysosomes [31, 32]. Thus,
increase of LC3-II indicated that activating autophagy.
But some paper showed that inhibition of autophagy
also increased LC3-II form [33]. A block of lysosomal
fusion with AVs inhibited degradation of LC3-II forms
[33]. Also, autophagic flux is inhibited, the level of p62,
an ubiquitin- and LC3-binding protein, is accumulated
[34, 35]. Thus, the comparative analysis about the LC3II/LC3-I ratio and p62 accumulation for the detection of
autophagic flux is necessary. And, some paper showed
that accumulation of p62 is detected in neurodegenerative
disorders including Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease
and Huntingtin aggregates in Huntington disease [36-38].
In addition, some studies have suggested that activating
this process plays a pivotal role in various conditions,
including adaptation to starvation and anti-cancer and
neuroprotective effects [39-44]. It is well known that
starvation stimulates the sirtuin family of deacetylases,
thereby activating autophagic flux [45-47]. In addition,
activation of autophagic flux increases Aβ clearance and
protects neuronal cells against Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity
by activating α7nAchR in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
cells [13]. However, a defect in α7nAchR signaling may
impair autophagic flux, thereby suppressing clearance
of Aβ, leading to increased neurotoxicity [13]. These
results suggest that the regulation of autophagic flux is
a key mechanism for preventing neural dysfunction. In

particular, activating autophagic flux through α7nAchR
signaling may prevent misfolded protein-mediated
neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s, and prion diseases. Our previous study
showed that overexpressing PrPC [48] and activating
autophagy protects neuron cells against PrP(106-126)mediated neurotoxicity [43, 44], respectively. However,
the relationship between PrPC and autophagy and prion
peptide-mediated neurotoxicity has not been reported.
Thus, the present study focused on the relationship
between PrPC expression and the regulation of autophagic
flux during PrP(106-126)-mediated neurotoxicity and
estimated the influence of α7nAchR signaling. The results
show that activating α7nAchR upregulates autophagic flux
and protects hippocampal neuron cells against PrP(106126)-mediated neurotoxicity. However, the protective
effect and upregulation of autophagic flux caused by
activating α7nAchR was suppressed by decreasing PrPC
gene expression. These results suggest that α7nAchRmediated autophagic flux may be regulated via PrPC
expression and that regulating PrPC expression is
applicable as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative
disorders including prion disease.

RESULTS
Regulation of α7nAchR activity influences
PrP(106-126)-mediated
neurotoxicity
by
upregulating autophagic flux in primary neuron
cells
Our previous study suggested that activating
autophagy protects neuronal cells against PrP(106-126)mediated neurotoxicity [43, 44]. Another study showed
that activating α7nAchR upregulates autophagic flux and
protects SH-SY5Y cells against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity
[13]. However, the influence of α7nAChR in prionmediated neurotoxicity has not been reported. Thus, we
determined whether activating α7nAChR upregulates
autophagic signaling during PrP (106-126)-induced
apoptosis (Figure 1). Primary cultured neuronal cells were
exposed to the α7nAChR inhibitor MLA or the α7nAChR
activator PNU-282987 for 12 hr and were treated with 50
μM PrP (106-126) for 24 hr. The Annexin V assay results
show that the number of apoptotic cells decreased after
PNU-282987 treatment in the PrP(106-126)-treated groups
(Figure 1A and 1B). Additionally, the number of Annexin
V-positive cells increased following MLA treatment in PrP
(106-126)-treated cells (Figure 1A and 1B). These data
show that activating α7nAChR signaling protects neuron
cells against prion-mediated neurotoxicity.
One study suggested that activating α7nAChR
may upregulate autophagic flux; thus, we determined
whether activating α7nAChR influenced autophagic flux

12 hr) and were then exposed to 50 μM PrP (106-126) for
12 h. that the results show that protein levels of α7nAChR
decreased and those of LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and p62
increased (autophagic flux inhibition marker) following
PrP (106-126) treatment. Additionally, MLA reinforced
the inhibition of autophagic signals caused by PrP(106126) treatment. However, PNU-282987 increased LC3-II/
LC3-I ratio and decreased p62 protein levels, indication
of activating autopagic flux, in the PrP(106-126)-treated

group, but α7nAChR expression did not change (Figure
1C). These results suggest that activating α7nAChR
signaling protects neuron cells against PrP(106-126)mediated apoptosis by upregulating autophagic flux.
To verify that α7nAChR plays a protective role
in PrP(106-126)-treated neuron cells via activation of
autophagic flux, we suppressed α7nAChR gene expression
using an α7nAChR RNAi oligomer in primary neuron
cells treated with PrP(106-126) and PNU-282987 as a
α7nAChR activator. The number of Annexin V-positive

treatment of PrP(106-126) increased apoptotic cells
populations in si-α7nAChR transfected cells compared to

(Figure 2A). In addition, the protective effect of PNU282987 against PrP(106-126)-mediated neurotoxicity
inhibited by knockdown of α7nAChR in primary neuronal
cells (Figure 2A). Additionally, Western blot analysis
showed that the treatment of si-α7nAChR inhibited

α7nAChR protein levels and increased LC3-II/LC3-I
ratio and p62 protein levels compared to those in negative
control RNAi oligomer (si-NC)-treated cells (Figure 2B).
Also, treatment of si-α7nAChR increased the inhibition
of autophagic flux in PrP(106-126)-treated cells (Figure
2B). Collectively, these data suggest that regulation
of α7nAChR signaling influenced to prion-mediated
neurotoxicity via modulation of autohpagic flux pathway.

PrP(106-126) treatment decreased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and
α7nAChR protein levels increased p62 protein levels in

Consistent with these results, fluorescence microscopy
showed that PrP(106-126) treatment or depleting PrPC

One study showed that depleting PrPC blocks
activation of α7nAChR signaling and inhibits autophagic

whether PrPC expression influences α7nAChR-mediated

To verify that PrPC plays a protective role in neuron

to overexpress the Prnp gene in PrP(106-126)-treated

resulted in PrPC overexpression compared to that in Adempty transfected cells (Figure 7A and 7B). Ad-Prmp and
Ad-empty transfected cells were pre-treated with PNU282987 (1 μM, 12 hr) and then exposed to 50 μM PrP

DISCUSSION
Our results demonstrate that activating α7nAChR
prevented prion-mediated neuronal damage by activating
autophagic flux and that inducing α7nAChR-mediated
autophagic flux regulates PrPC expression in neuron
cells. A Notably, activation of autophagic flux caused by
α7nAChR was related to PrPC expression in neuron cells,
which, in turn, conferred neuroprotection.
Some studies have reported that activating
α7nAChR regulates cholinergic signaling and may lead
to recover cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease
models [13, 49, 50]. Nicotine and A-582941, which are
α7nAChR agonists, protect neurons from Aβ-induced
neuronal damage by upregulating the α7nAChR signaling
pathway [50, 51]. ABT-107, which is a α7nAChR agonist,
also prevents neurotoxicity induced by l-dopa-induced

dyskinesia [52]. Neuronal cholinergic receptors are
reduced in patients with Alzheimer’s disease; particularly,
α7nAChR expression decreases 32% [53]. Consistent
with this finding, we showed here that PrP(106-126)treated cells had decreased viability (Figure 1A and 1B)
and α7nAChR protein expression in primary neuron
cells (Figure 1C). In addition, the α7nAChR agonist
PNU-282987 protected neuron cells from PrP(106-126),
whereas treatment with the α7nAChR antagonist MLA
enhanced PrP(106-126)-mediated neurotoxicity (Figure
1A and 1B), although the α7nAChR protein expression did
not change (Figure 1C). These data support the hypothesis
that regulation of α7nAChR may influence prion-mediated
neurotoxicity in neuron cells.
One study reported that α7nAChR activity
is regulated by PrPC expression [9], whereas other
studies suggest that PrPC has a protective effect against
neuronal damage [48], including prion peptide-mediated
neurotoxicity. Also, neuroprotection is associated with
autophagic flux signals [43, 44] and the protective
effect were inhibited by PrPC depletion in hippocampal
cells [23]. One paper showed that PrPC-depleted cells
show increased expression of LC3-II, autophagy marker
protein levels, and autophagosomes under serum starved
conditions [21]. This accumulation of LC3-II is inhibited
by transfecting the PrPC gene into PrPC knockout
neuron cells [21]. These results indicate that PrPC may
downregulate autophagic flux in neuron cells. However,
Oh et al. suggested that PrPC knockout neuron cells have
impaired autophagic flux caused by oxidative stress,
whereas wild-type neuron cells exposed to oxidative
stress increase autophagic flux [23]. The main mechanism
of misfolded protein-mediated neurotoxicity is oxidative
stress [54, 55]. Prion-mediated neurotoxicity is also
mainly related with oxidative stress [56-58]. Our results
show that the PrPC knockout Zpl 3-4 hippocampal neuron
cells increased PrP(106-126)-mediated neurotoxicity
compared to that of ZW 13-2 cells. In addition, Zpl 3-4
cells had increased p62 protein levels and LC3-II/LC3-I
ratio compared to those of ZW 13-2 cells, but PrP(106126) has no effect in Zpl 3-4 cells (Figure 3A and 3B).
Thus, we hypothesize that PrP(106-126) treatment or
depleting the PrPC gene inhibits autophagic flux and that
PrPC may prevent prion peptide-mediated neurotoxicity
by upregulating autophagic flux in neuron cells.
Autophagy is the main lysosomal catabolic pathway
for recycling and degrading old cell organelles [25, 59].
The main function of autophagy is facilitated adaption
of cells exposed to microenvironments, including caloric
restriction, tumor metastasis, immune reactions, ischemic
heart disease, and neurodegeneration [60-62]. One
study suggested that activating autophagy may play a
neuroprotective role in Alzheimer’s disease and is related
with α7nAChR signaling [13]. That same study showed
that inhibiting α7nAChR signaling or depleting ATG7
gene enhanced Aβ-induced neurotoxicity [13]. Consistent

with this finding, our results show that PNU-282987,
an α7nAChR agonist, increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and
decreased p62, a marker of activated autophagic flux, and
that α7nAChR antagonist or α7nAChR RNA oligomer
treatment inhibited autophagic flux in primary cultured
neuron cells (Figs. 1C and 2C). In addition, PNU-282987
protected neuron cells against PrP(106-12)-mediated
neurotoxicity and MLA enhanced PrP(106-126)-mediated
neurotoxicity (Figure 1A, 1B and 2A). These results also
similarly showed in ZW 13-2 cells (Figs. 4). However, the
α7nAChR-mediated autophagic flux and protective effect
disappeared in PrPC knockout Zpl 3-4 cells (Figs. 5 and
6). In addition, we found that depleting PrPC decreased
α7nAChR expression (Figure 3A and 3B). Thus, we
hypothesize that PrPC is a key factor in the regulation of
the α7nAChR pathway and is related with autophagic flux
and neuroprotection against prion-mediated neurotoxicity.
PrPC expression demonstrated that PNU282987 did not inhibit prion peptide-mediated neuronal
apoptosis and blocked autophagic signals, indicating that
activating the α7nAChR pathway has a neuroprotective
effect related with PrPC expression. In addition, PrPC
overexpression using an adenoviral vector increased PrPC
and α7nAChR protein expression levels. Overexpression
of PrPC upregulated α7nAChR-mediated autophagic flux
and activated α7nAChR signaling to prevent PrP(106126)-mediated neurotoxicity in PrPC knockout Zpl 3-4
cells. These observations support the hypothesis that
PrPC regulates α7nAChR signals and that activation of
α7nAChR signals protects neuronal cells from prionmediated neurotoxicity by regulating the autophagy
pathway.
This is the first report demonstrating that α7nAChR
signaling is regulated by PrPC expression and that
upregulation α7nAChR signaling may be related with
autophagy signals that protect against PrP(106-126)mediated neurotoxicity. These results suggest that
upregulation of PrPC and inducers of α7nAChR, including
nicotine and PNU-282987, may be useful neurotherapeutic
strategies for neurodegenerative diseases, including
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and prion diseases.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assay

Methyllycaconitine citrate salt (MLA) and PNU-282987
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA). The immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry
antibodies targeted LC3 and cleaved-caspase-3 (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), α7nAchR
(Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), p62 (Millipore,
Temecula, CA, USA) and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).

The TUNEL analysis was performed to measure
the degree of cellular apoptosis using the APOBrdU™ TUNEL Assay Kit (Invitrogen), following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed
with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and fixed in
paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were pre-incubated
with 50 μL DNA-labeling solution (10 μL TdT reaction
buffer, 0.75 μL TdT enzyme, and 8 μL Br-dUTP) for 1
hr at 37°C and then incubated with 5 μL anti-BrdU-FITC
antibody for 30 min at room temperature (20°C). Finally,
the cells were mounted with DakoCytomation fluorescent
medium and visualized under a fluorescent microscope
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The cells were counterstained
with propidium iodide to reveal cell nuclei.

Primary neuron cell cultures
BALB/c mice brains were isolated from E-15
mice embryos using surgical procedures approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chonbuk
National University. Brain tissues were isolated under
sterile conditions, rinsed in HBSS, and minced into small
pieces. After dissection, the brain tissues were dissociated
in trypsin and plated on poly-D-lysine-coated 24-well
plates in MEM, containing 10% FBS. The medium was
replaced with NBM supplemented with B27 and Glutamax
after 2 hr. All cell cultures were maintained at 37°C in 5%
CO2.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES;
pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1
mM DTT, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Proteins
were electrophoretically resolved by 10-15% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE), and immunoblotting was performed as described
previously. Equal amounts of lysate protein were resolved
by 10-15% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoreactivity was
detected through sequential incubation with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced
chemiluminescent reagents. Densitometry of the signal
bands was conducted using the Bio-1D densitometer
(VilberLourmat, Eberhardzell, Germany). The antibodies
used for immunoblotting were α7nAchR, p-62, LC3,
PrPC, and ß-actin. Images were examined using a FusionFX7 imaging system (Vilber Lourmat).

Cell culture
The mouse neuronal cell lines ZW 13-2 and Zpl
3-4, which were established from the hippocampus of
ICR (Prnp+/+) and Zürich I Prnp−/− mice, respectively, were
kindly provided by Professor Yong-Sun Kim (Hallym
University, Chuncheon, Kangwon-do, South Korea).
The cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS
and gentamycin (0.1 mg/ml) in a humidified incubator
maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2.

PrP (106-126) treatment
Synthetic PrP (106-126) (sequence, Lys-Thr-AsnMet-Lys-His-Met-Ala-Gly-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Gly-Ala-ValVal-Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly) was synthesized by Peptron (Seoul,
Korea). The peptide was dissolved at a concentration of
12.5 mM in sterile DMSO and stored at −80°C.

Immunocytochemistry
The cells were cultured on glass cover slips, washed
with PBS, and fixed in cold acetone for 90 s at room
temperature. They were washed again with PBS, blocked
with 5% FBS in Tris buffered saline with Tween, and
incubated with anti-mouse-p-62 (2 μg/ml) monoclonal
antibody and anti-rabbit-LC3 (2 μg/ml) polyclonal
antibody for 48 hr at room temperature. Unbound antibody
was removed by an additional PBS wash, and the cells
were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit FITC
(for the anti-LC3 and anti-α7nAchR antibodies) and
Alexa Fluor 546 anti-mouse (for the anti-p62 antibody)
IgG antibodies (4 μg/ml) for 2 hr at room temperature.
Finally, the cells were mounted using the DakoCytomation
fluorescent medium (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and

Annexin V assay
Apoptosis was assessed with the Annexin V assay
in detached cells using the Annexin V Assay kit (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Annexin V was quantified
by measuring fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of
488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525/30 nm using a
Guava EasyCyte HT (Millipore)
