BACKGROUND: Radiologic assessment of tumor response in pancreatic cancer is complicated by desmoplastic reactions within or around the tumor. The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation
between a decline in carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who received upfront chemotherapy. METHODS: CA 19-9 serum basal values were measured in
247 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who were enrolled in 5 consecutive trials between 1997 and
2007. Survival curves were compared among patients who had a predefined CA 19-9 nadir variation
(<50%. Group 1; 50% to 89%, Group 2; or >89%, Group 3). To eliminate guarantee-time bias, survival analysis was repeated using the landmark method. RESULTS: In both univariate and multivariate analysis, the basal CA 19-9 value significantly predicted survival. The median survival was 15.5 months for 34 patients who
had normal basal CA 19-9 values, 11.9 months for 108 patients who had basal values between 38 U/mL and
1167 U/mL, and 8 months for 105 patients who had basal values >1167 U/mL. At least 1 CA 19-9 follow-up
value was available for 204 patients who had baseline values greater than normal. A significant difference
in overall survival was observed in univariate and multivariate analyses between Groups 1 and 2, between
Groups 1 and 3, and between Groups 2 and 3. The results were confirmed using the landmark method.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, baseline CA 19-9 was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor for survival, and it may be considered as a stratification factor in trials in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Biochemical response may be used as a complementary measure to radiologic response to provide a
better assessment of chemotherapy activity and to drive treatment decisions in clinical practice. Cancer

Patients with stage III and metastatic pancreatic cancer1 have a dismal prognosis; and, despite the relevant number of prospective trials performed, the advantage in overall survival (OS) yielded by chemotherapy doublets over single-agent gemcitabine has been either absent2-6 or negligible and of marginal clinical
significance.7,8 Although combination chemotherapy with 4 agents9 more consistently improved the outcome in phase 3 comparisons with standard gemcitabine, and although the survival improvement was not
achieved at the cost of impaired quality of life,10 the purpose of treatment remained palliative. In this

context, a reliable assessment of tumor response to chemotherapy may assume a crucial role in driving treatment
decisions aimed at obtaining the maximum possible benefit, such as whether to continue an active therapy, to stop
an inactive therapy, or to change the regimen when effective second-line chemotherapy will be validated. In fact, it
may allow clinicians to distinguish patients who likely will
benefit from continuing therapy from those who may
avoid a futile treatment that unnecessarily exposes them to
the risk of quality-of-life impairment and who eventually
may be considered for salvage therapy or best supportive
care. Among the available tools for tumor response assessment, the evaluation of radiologic responses, even with
newer imaging techniques, is considered rather unreliable
because of the vigorous desmoplastic reaction, including
inflammation and fibrosis, within and around the
tumor.11
Among the surrogate markers of treatment efficacy,
a decrease in carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) has
been proposed. CA 19-9 is a sialylated Lewis blood group,
tumor-associated antigen that is not synthesized by individuals who lack the Lewis antigen glycosyl-transferase.
There have been several retrospective studies that identified a correlation between a decline in serum CA 19-9
value and prolonged survival.12-18 However, because of
the limited numbers of patients in those studies and the
various definitions of CA 19-9 response, a consensus was
not reached about the frequency with which tests should
be performed or about the meaningful cutoff level of
marker change. Furthermore, a recent retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from a randomized
phase 3 trial suggested that a decrease in CA 19-9 during
chemotherapy (analyzed by correcting for guarantee-time
bias) is not a valid surrogate endpoint for survival in clinical trials.19 Data from the latter trial are difficult to interpret because of the high percentage of missing values (72
of 247 patients; 29%) and because a decline in CA 19-9
concentration of 50% was related significantly to survival in the analysis that was not corrected for guaranteetime bias and in the Cox regression model.19 The objective of the current study was to assess the correlation
between a decline in CA 19-9 value and survival in a large
cohort of patients treated at a single institution and
pooled from 5 consecutive trials that examined the role of
first-line therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer.9,20-23

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
All chemotherapy-naive patients with cytologically or histologically proven stage III or metastatic adenocarcinoma
of the pancreas1 who were treated between April 1997
and January 2007 at our institution on 5 consecutive trials9,20-23 were considered eligible for the current study.
Patients aged 75 years who had a Karnofsky performance status (PS) >50; at least 1 measurable indicator
lesion; adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 1500 cells/mm3, platelet count
100.000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin 10 g/dL), kidney function (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL), and liver
function (serum total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL and serum
transaminases 3 times the upper limit of laboratory normal [ULN]) received either a 4-drug regimen (cisplatin,
epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and gemcitabine [PEFG];
cisplatin, epirubicin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine
[PEXG]; or cisplatin, docetaxel, capecitabine, and gemcitabine [PDXG])9,20-23 or gemcitabine alone.9 Cycles were
repeated every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses or
until there was evidence of either unacceptable side effects
or progressive disease. Patients with ampullary tumors or
other histologic variants of pancreatic carcinoma were not
considered for this analysis. CA 19-9 measurements were
performed immediately before the start of chemotherapy
and every 4 weeks thereafter. Jaundice, when present, was
resolved surgically or endoscopically before study enrolment and before repeating basal CA 19-9 measurement.
The ULN for CA 19-9 was 37 U/mL. Baseline and follow-up measurements for any given patient were performed at the same laboratory using the same testing
method. The CA 19-9 nadir was defined as the lowest
value measured at any time for each individual patient
compared with the baseline value. A computed tomography scan was obtained at baseline, every 8 weeks during
treatment, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Response to
treatment was assessed according to either the World
Health Organization24 for the earlier 3 studies9,20,21 or
according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors25 for the 2 most recent studies.22,23 Progressionfree survival (PFS) was calculated as the interval between
the initiation of treatment and the occurrence of progressive disease or death from any cause, and survival was
measured from the initiation of treatment to the date of
2631

either death from any cause or the last follow-up
assessment.

Statistical Analysis
In univariate analyses, OS and PFS curves were estimated
with the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared
among patients with an arbitrarily predefined CA 19-9
change at nadir with respect to the baseline value (<50%,
Group 1 [nonresponders]; 50%-89%, Group 2 [minor
biochemical response]; and 90%, Group 3 [major
biochemical response]) by using the log-rank test.
To eliminate guarantee-time bias, the survival analysis was repeated using the landmark method26,27 on Day
57 (7 days; ie, on Day 1 of the third cycle). In that analysis, patients who had disease progression or who died
before the date of the landmark evaluation were excluded,
and the response groups were defined on the basis of
response status at the landmark regardless of any subsequent shifts in tumor response status only for patients
who remained on the study. Then, OS was measured
from the landmark time to the date of either death from
any cause or the last follow-up assessment. Thus, probability estimates and statistical tests were conditional based
on the response status of patients at the landmark time.
Multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional-hazards model was carried out to estimate independent risk
factors that could affect OS. All probability (P) values
were from 2-sided tests. Clinical characteristics and
response rates were compared using the chi-square test
or the Fisher exact test for categorical variables, as
appropriate.

RESULTS
The final analysis was performed on May 19, 2008, when
235 of 252 patients (93%) had died and 17 patients who
remained alive had completed 13 months of follow-up
(median follow-up, 21 months; range, 13-50 months).
No patients were lost to follow-up. Patientsâ€™ characteristics are reported in Table 1. No significant difference
among patient subgroups was observed apart a significantly greater number of patients with stage IV disease in
the group with higher basal CA 19-9 values. Twenty
patients underwent previous curative surgery and had
2632

metastatic failure at the time of enrollment. Thirty-five
patients underwent previous palliative surgery.

Baseline Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 Value
Baseline CA 19-9 was detected in 247 of 252 patients in
the current study (98%) and was >1 time the ULN (>37
U/mL) in 213 patients (86%). Among patients who had
baseline values >1 time the ULN, the median CA 19-9
value was 35.4 times the ULN (1167 U/mL; range, 38368,450 U/mL). Patients who had baseline CA 19-9 <1
time the ULN (N Â¼ 34) had longer OS compared with
patients who had basal CA 19-9 values between 38 U/mL
and 1167 U/mL (P Â¼ .05) and compared with patients
who had basal CA 19-9 values >1167 U/mL (P Â¼
.00006) (Fig. 1A). Patients who had pretreatment CA 199 values between 38 U/mL and 1167 U/mL (N Â¼ 108)
had significantly longer survival than patients who had
CA 19-9 values greater than the median (N Â¼ 105; P Â¼
.0004) (Fig. 1A). In a Cox multivariate analysis that was
stratified for age, PS, stage, sex, and treatment arm, the
CA 19-9 value at baseline independently predicted OS
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.21-1.97; P Â¼ .0002).
Patients who had baseline CA 19-9 values <1 time
the ULN (N Â¼ 34) had a PFS similar to that of patients
who had basal CA 19-9 values between 38 U/mL and
1167 U/mL (P Â¼ .33) (Fig. 1B) and had longer PFS compared with patients who had basal CA 19-9 values >1167
U/mL (P Â¼ .002) (Fig. 1B). Patients who had basal CA
19-9 values between 38 U/mL and 1167 U/mL had a
longer PFS compared with patients who had basal CA
19-9 values >1167 U/mL (P Â¼ .003) (Fig. 1B).
Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 Nadir Response
to Chemotherapy
At least 1 CA 19-9 follow-up value was available for 204
of 213 patients (96%) who had baseline values >1 time
the ULN. Nine patients had no follow-up value because
of a protocol violation (N Â¼ 6) or a treatment interruption caused by clinical deterioration (N Â¼ 2) or refusal (N
Â¼ 1). Forty patients had only 1 CA 19-9 value after baseline. When considering the nadir value, an increase in the
CA 19-9 value or a decrease <50% was observed in 67
patients (33%; Group 1 [nonresponders]), including 49

To eliminate guarantee-time bias, survival analysis was
repeated by the landmark method at the time of the first
radiologic assessment (Day 57  7; ie, Day 1 of the third
cycle), as proposed previously.19,26,27 Survival data for the
3 groups are reported in Table 4. Twenty-five patients
had a missing value at this time point because of protocol
violation (N Â¼ 6) or treatment interruption because of
progression, toxicity, refusal, or death (N Â¼ 19). A significant difference in OS was observed between Groups 1 and
2 (P Â¼ .003), between Groups 1 and 3 (P Â¼ .003), and
between Groups 2 and 3 (P Â¼ .02).
In a Cox multivariate analysis that was stratified for
age, sex, PS, stage, CA 19-9 value at baseline, and treatment arm, CA 19-9 response to chemotherapy independently predicted OS (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.45-0.77; P Â¼

(5%; median survival, 15 months), a decrease between

(84%) had basal a CA 19-9 value >1 time the ULN and
at least 1 follow-up CA 19-9 measurement. In these
patients, an increase in CA 19-9 value or a decrease

DISCUSSION
The current analysis confirms that the CA 19-9 value at
baseline in patients with stage III and/or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is correlated independently with
survival and that there is a significant relation between CA
19-9 decline during chemotherapy and survival. The
prognostic value of baseline CA 19-9 value was reported
previously by many authors.5,18,19,28 The median value of

of patients with CA 19-9 basal levels below or above the
median (11.9 months and 8 months, respectively)
observed in our series were consistent with those reported
in previous series in patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer (958-2000 U/mL, 10.3-14.9 months, and 5.5-7.4
months, respectively).5,15,19,28 Accordingly, our findings
endorse the application of the pretreatment CA 19-9
value as a stratification factor for future trials in advanced
pancreatic cancer.
Several clinical trials analyzed the use of the CA 199 response to chemotherapy as a potential surrogate
marker of treatment efficacy.12,13,15-17,19,28 Usually, a
decline in the basal CA 19-9 level by 20%12,15,17 or by
50% is defined as biochemical response.13,16,28 In contrast to those studies, a recent series analyzing larger number of patients with more robust methodology and
statistical tools questioned the value of CA 19-9 response
at the nadir as a reliable surrogate endpoint for survival.19
In our current retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, a significant correlation of CA 19-9 response
both at the nadir and at a fixed time point (with adjustment for guarantee-time bias) with survival was observed.
Important strengths of this study are the large number of
patients; the small rate of missing follow-up values (11%
vs 29%-43% in previous series15,19); the completeness of
the Cox model (only 1 missing value); and the involve2636

ment of a single institution, which reduced the risk of heterogeneity in laboratory and testing CA 19-9 methods, in
clinical and radiologic criteria on which treatment decisions are based, and in patient management strategies at
the time of treatment failure. Apart from these factors, the
difference in results may rely on the more active chemotherapy regimens administered to most of our patients in
terms of both tumor response and disease control duration. The overall radiologic response rate was 44%, the
â€˜â€˜biochemical responseâ€™â€™ rate (a decline 50% in the CA
19-9 value) was 64% (137 of 213 patients who had initial
levels >1 time the ULN), and the median PFS was 6.2
months as opposed to radiologic and biochemical
response rates of 9% and 45%, respectively (112 of 247
patients), and a median PFS 4.1 months reported in other
series.19 The difference in activity also was suggested by
the time to CA 19-9 nadir (3.5 months vs 2 months in
previous series19), implying more enduring chemotherapy
activity. More active treatment may be better for addressing the validity of a candidate tool for tumor response
assessment. In the current analysis, a CA 19-9 decrease
90% was associated with a remarkable prolongation of
survival compared with decreases between 50% and 89%
(Tables 2, 4). The 90% cutoff level may be more appropriate than the 50% level for defining a â€˜â€˜biochemical
response.â€™â€™ This also was suggested by our analysis of the

ever, a â€˜â€˜major biochemical responseâ€™â€™ was associated with
longer survival compared with a â€˜â€˜minor biochemical
responseâ€™â€™ (median survival, 15 months vs 10.7 months).
Among those with stable disease, 67% to 71% of patients
in other series and 64% of patients in our current series
had a 50% tumor marker decrease.3,19,29,30 Again, a
major biochemical response was associated with a doubling of the median survival compared with a minor biochemical response (20.1 months vs 10 months), which
resulted in little improvement with respect to nonresponders (8.5 months). Finally, among patients who had
radiologic progressive disease, a tumor marker response
50% was reported previously in 30% to 48% of
patients.3,19,29,30 In our series, 18% of patients who experienced progressive disease had a biochemical response,
and only 1 of those patients had a major biochemical
response. The OS for patients with radiologic progressive
disease and a biochemical response, as previously reported
by others,16 was significantly better than the OS for
patients with a radiologic response but without a biochemical response.
The interpretation of the relation between biochemical response and survival is troublesome, because the hypothesis cannot be rebutted that response may represent a
prognostic marker only because it may select the patients
who would have survived longer even if the therapy had
no effect at all.26,27 In fact, patients who eventually
become responders must survive long enough to be evaluated as responders, whereas patients who die before
response assessment automatically are included in the
group of nonresponders.26,27 Thus, the risk of death is
overestimated for nonresponders and underestimated for
responders. In an attempt to limit the bias that response
may act as a selection mechanism of a prognostically
favorable subgroup of patients based on pretreatment
characteristics and to clarify whether survival depends on
response status, we used the landmark method by choosing a guarantee time that was as long as the time to the
first radiologic response evaluation, as proposed previously.19,26,27 The hypothesis that survival from landmark
depended on response status at landmark was confirmed
by both univariate and multivariate analyses that stratified
patients for known prognostic factors for survival. However, this observation does not exclude the possibility that
response is merely a marker of unknown prognostic factors. The causality of the relation between response and

survival can be proven only with randomized trials comparing treatments that differ both in terms of activity and
efficacy.26,27 Data from 5 prospective series, which used
the same inclusion criteria and included 1 randomized series comparing single-agent gemcitabine with the PEFG
regimen, were used in the current analysis.9,20,21-23 Treatment groups did not differ significantly in terms of baseline characteristics (Table 1). Single-agent gemcitabine
had significantly inferior efficacy compared with 4-drugâ€“
based chemotherapy combinations both in univariate and
multivariate analysis (Table 3, Fig. 3). Although the current analysis does not provide a level of evidence comparable to that obtained from a randomized trial, the
difference in terms of biochemical response between
single-agent gemcitabine and combination chemotherapy
reinforces the possibility that survival is influenced not
only by the chance that a patient is classified into 1
response group or the other but also by response to
treatment.
On the basis of the current findings, minor and
major biochemical response may be proposed as complementary measures to radiologic response, which is particularly troublesome in this disease because of desmoplastic
tissue within and/or around the tumor, for more appropriate assessments of the activity of new chemotherapy
agents and combinations. CA 19-9 represents an ideal
endpoint for clinical studies because it is quick, safe, and
easy to measure and allows the assessment of patients with
â€˜â€˜unmeasurableâ€™â€™ disease. CA 19-9 is not expressed in 10%
to 15% of patients with pancreatic cancer who are negative for the Lewis blood group antigen; therefore, the current considerations cannot be applied to this subset of
patients. The information provided by this tool also may
be useful in clinical practice to drive treatment decisions
in critical situations, such as whether to continue with

palliative chemotherapy in patients who have radiologically stable or progressive disease.
