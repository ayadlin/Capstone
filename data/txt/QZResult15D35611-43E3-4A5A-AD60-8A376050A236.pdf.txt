Abstract
AZD6244 is a small molecule inhibitor of the MEK (MAP/ERK kinase) pathway currently in clinical trials.
However, the mechanisms mediating intrinsic resistance to MEK inhibition are not fully characterized. To define
molecular mechanisms of MEK inhibitor resistance, we analyzed responses of 38 lung cancer cell lines following
AZD6244 treatment and their genome-wide gene expression profiles and identified a panel of genes correlated with
sensitivity or resistance to AZD6244 treatment. In particular, ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that activation of
the STAT3 pathway was associated with MEK inhibitor resistance. Inhibition of this pathway by JSI-124, a STAT3specific small molecule inhibitor, or with STAT3-specific siRNA sensitized lung cancer cells to AZD6244 and induced
apoptosis. Moreover, combining a STAT3 inhibitor with AZD6244 induced expression of BIM and PARP cleavage,
whereas activation of the STAT3 pathway inhibited BIM expression and elicited resistance to MEK inhibitors. We
found that the STAT3-regulated microRNA miR-17 played a critical role in MEK inhibitor resistance, such that miR17 inhibition sensitized resistant cells to AZD6244 by inducing BIM and PARP cleavage. Together, these results
indicated that STAT3-mediated overexpression of miR-17 blocked BIM expression and caused resistance to
AZD6244. Our findings suggest novel approaches to overcome resistance to MEK inhibitors by combining AZD6244
with STAT3 or miR-17 inhibitors. Cancer Res; 71(10); 3658–68. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The MEK (MAP/ERK kinase)/extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK) pathway is a critical downstream signal-transduction cascade of most growth factor receptors and is
essential for cell growth, survival, differentiation, and transformation. Consequently, MEK inhibitors have been actively
investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of various solid
tumors (1, 2). Promising results in disease stabilization with
the use of tolerable doses of MEK inhibitors have been
observed in some groups of patients with lung, pancreatic,
or colon cancers or with melanoma (3, 4).
Although MEK inhibitor treatment has produced clinical
responses in some patients, a subset of tumors is resistant to
this agent, indicating the presence of intrinsic resistance or
sensitivity to MEK inhibition. Some reports have shown that

BRAF mutations, especially the BRAF (V600E) mutation, are
correlated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in melanoma and
other cancer cells (5, 6). Other studies have indicated that
mutations in MEK1 or activation of the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) pathway due to mutations in the PI3K p110-a
catalytic subunit, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) predict resistance to
the MEK inhibitor in KRAS-mutated cells (7–11). However, the
molecular mechanism of MEK inhibitor resistance has not
been fully elucidated. Specific genetic mutations are good
predictors of sensitivity to MEK inhibitors; however, some
tumor growth may not totally depend on signaling caused by a
specific genetic mutation but rather on multiple signaling
pathways. More and more evidence indicates that activation
of functionally redundant pathways is responsible for resistance to targeted therapy and that identifying and cotargeting
those pathways may overcome resistance and induce synergistic antitumor effects (12). Recently, we and other groups
found that a high level of AKT activity is associated with
resistance to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 in lung cancer and
that simultaneous inhibition of the AKT and ERK pathways
induced increased antitumor activity by AZD6244 (8, 13).
Therefore, identifying the signaling pathway associated with
MEK inhibitor resistance will help determine the biomarkers
that predict responses to MEK inhibitor treatment and
develop potential combination strategies to overcome resistance.
In this study, we used genome-wide gene expression profiling followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and found

that activation of the STAT3 pathway was associated with
AZD6244 resistance. Thus, inhibition of the STAT3 pathway
sensitized resistant cells to AZD6244 treatment, whereas
activation of STAT3 induced resistance to AZD6244 in sensitive cells. We further observed that STAT3-mediated MEK
inhibitor resistance occurred through microRNA (miRNA)
miR-17. Our results suggest that miR-17, which is regulated
by the STAT3 pathway, mediated MEK inhibitor resistance by
suppressing BIM expression.

Array data were preprocessed with MAS5 (Affymetrix algorithm for probe summarization) and then quantile normalized
and log transformed.
Plasmids and anti-miRNA transfection
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for the transfection of plasmid DNA or anti-miRNA inhibitor. Forty-eight
hours after transfection, cells were treated with AZD6244
for response and apoptosis analysis, or cell lysates and total
RNA were prepared for Western blotting and real-time PCR.

Material and Methods
Chemicals and reagents
AZD6244 was synthesized in Dr. William Bornmann's
laboratory at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center. Antibodies against Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), interleukin-6
signal transducer (IL6ST), phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3),
phosphorylated JAK1 (p-JAK1), phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK),
phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK),
phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK), AKT, ERK, and
PARP were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against BIM were obtained from Calbiochem. Protease
inhibitor cocktail, b-actin antibody, and sulforhodamine B
(SRB) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Corporation. Plasmid pcDNA3–miR-17 was from Dr. Joshua Mendell (Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD).
MiR-17 inhibitor, anti–miR-17, and anti-miRNA negative control were purchased from Ambion. Reagents for the real-time
quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay of miR-17 were purchased from
Qiagen. Plasmid pcDNA-3.1-STAT3-CA was from Dr. James E.
Darnell (The Rockefeller University, New York; ref. 14). STAT3
siRNA was designed on the basis of work by Konnikova and
colleagues and synthesized by Qiagen (15).
Cell lines
All human lung cancer cell lines were from Hamon Center
for Therapeutic Oncology Research, The University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas. Cell lines were maintained in high-glucose RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS,
the cells were cultured at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 and 95% air.
Cell viability assay
The inhibitory effects of AZD6244 on cell growth were
determined using the MTS (Promega) or SRB colorimetric
assay, as described previously (16, 17). Each experiment was
carried out in octuplicate and repeated at least 3 times. The
relative cell viability (%) was calculated using the equation
ODT/ODC  100%, where ODT represents the absorbance of
the treatment group and ODC represents the absorbance of
the control group. Median inhibitory concentration (IC50)
values were determined using in-house software (DIVISA)
and plotted in dose-response curves.
Microarrays
Five micrograms of RNAs were labeled and hybridized to
Affymetrix GeneChips HG-U133A and HG-U133B according to
the manufacturer's protocol (http://www.affymetrix.com).

www.aacrjournals.org

Real-time qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). For analysis of JAK1 and IL6ST and BIM,
real-time qPCR was done using the First-Strand Reverse Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) followed by the Real Time PCR Kit
from Bio-Rad in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served
as the internal control. For miRNA expression analysis, realtime qPCR was done using the miRNA reverse transcription kit
(Qiagen) and miRNA assays kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocols. miRNA SNORD44 served as an internal
control. The sequences of the primers used were as follows:
JAK1, 50 primer (50 -GAATGACGCCACACTGACTG-30 ) and 30
primer (50 -GATGACAAGATGTCCCTCCG-30 ); IL6ST, 50 primer
(50 -GATGACAAGATGTCCCTCCG-30 ) and 30 primer (50 -AAA
GGACAGGATGTTGCAGG-30 ); and GAPDH, 50 primer (50 -ATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAG-30 ) and 30 primer (50 -ATGAGTCCTTCCACGATACC-30 ).
siRNA knockdown experiments
Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were treated
with AZD6244 for the dose-response assay and cell cycle
analysis. Cell lysates and RNA were prepared for further
analysis by Western blotting and real-time qPCR.
Western blotting analysis
Standard Western blotting was carried out using antibodies
described above in the reagent section and as described
previously (17). The immunoreactive bands were visualized
with the Odyssey Imager (Li-COR Biosciences).
Cell cycle and apoptosis assay
Our cell cycle and apoptosis assays have been described
previously (13). The cells were treated with AZD6244 alone or
combination with JSI-124 for 48 hours and harvested by
trypsinization. Cells were analyzed on an EPICS Profile II flow
cytometer (Coulter Corp.) using the Multicycle AV software
(Phoenix Flow Systems). Experiments were repeated at least 3
times.
Pathway analysis
The panel of genes significantly correlated with resistance
or sensitivity (P < 0.05) to the MEK inhibitor were imported
into IPA (Ingenuity Systems, http://www.ingenuity.com) to
analyze network interactions. Networks of these significantly

correlated genes were then algorithmically generated on the
basis of their connectivity.
Animal study
Female BALB/c nude mice (6- to 8-weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Animal experiments
were carried out according to the protocol (11-03-09933)
approval by the MD Anderson institutional review board
and in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health. A total of 2  106 H460 cells were inoculated
subcutaneously into the right dorsal flanks of the nude mice.
Treatments were started when tumors reached an average
volume of about 0.1 cm3, which was around 7 days after cells
were inoculated. Mice were randomly divided into control and
treatment groups (n ¼ 5 animals per group). The treatment
groups were administered 20 mg/kg AZD6244, 1 mg/kg JSI124, or combination of AZD6244 (20 mg/kg) and JSI-124 (1
mg/kg), all of which had been solubilized in a medium
containing 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and 0.1% polysorbate buffer. AZD6244 was administered once daily by oral
gavage. JSI-124 was administered intraperitoneally. The control group received the buffer alone. Tumor size was measured
by calipers every other day. The tumor volume was calculated
with the formula: length  width2  0.52. Mice were euthanized when their tumor volume was larger than 2000 mm3.
Immunohistochemical staining
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of animal tumor tissue specimens were used for immunostaining
with antibodies against p-ERK and p-STAT3 with AEC immunohistochemical staining kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analyses
Association between gene expression and responses to
treatment with MEK inhibitor was determined by calculating
log2 ratios of resistant versus sensitive cell lines, and its
significance was determined using Student's t test. Ingenuity
software was used to carry out signaling pathway analysis.
Pathways linked with correlated genes were identified as
described in the pathway analysis part. The significance of
the in vivo animal study data was determined by using the
Mann–Whitney U test.

Results
Gene expression profiling identified that activation of
the STAT pathway correlated with AZD6244 resistance
in lung cancer cell lines
To determine the molecular mechanism underlying MEK
inhibitor resistance, previously we have tested responses to
AZD6244 in 38 non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines.
Susceptibility to AZD6244 differed dramatically between the
cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 250 mmol/L
indicating that human lung cancer cells have a range of
degrees of intrinsic resistance or sensitivity to MEK inhibitor
treatment (18). Analysis of genetic gene mutations of the cell

lines did not find correlation between the gene mutation
status of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, or PI3K and the sensitivity to
AZD6244 (18). We then analyzed the gene expression profiles
and MEK inhibitor responses of the 5 cell lines that were the
most sensitive (Calu-6, H2087, H596, H2073, and H2887),
whose IC50 values ranged from 0.0287 to 0.519 mmol/L, and
of the 12 most resistant cell lines (H441, H1650, H1819, H1993,
HCC366, H460, HCC1359, H1155, H1299, HCC15, HCC95, and
HCC2450) whose IC50 values ranged from 50 to more than 100
mmol/L. Through this analysis, we identified many genes
whose expression levels correlated strongly (with normal
P < 0.05) with their sensitivity or resistance to AZD6244
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table 1). Further pathway analysis
of those genes showed that activation of the STAT3 pathway
correlated most strongly with resistance to AZD6244 (Fig. 1B).
Validate the correlation of gene expression with
sensitivity to AZD6244
To confirm that activation of the STAT3 pathway was
correlated with MEK inhibitor resistance, real-time PCR
was carried out to determine the expression of JAK1 and
IL6ST, which are related to STAT pathways and were higher in
resistant cell lines than that in sensitive cell lines, as determined by our gene expression mRNA array. We checked the
expression of these molecules in randomly selected sensitive
and resistant cell lines (4 each) using real-time qPCR and
Western blotting. Real-time qPCR results showed that expression of both JAK1 and IL6ST was much higher in resistant cell
lines than in sensitive cell lines (Fig. 2A and B). Western
blotting also confirmed that levels of p-STAT3. and IL6ST were
higher in resistant cell lines than in sensitive cell lines,
indicating that the STAT3 pathway was constitutively activated in resistant cell lines (Fig. 2C). Based on the database of
Cancer Cell line Project (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/
CGP/CellLines/), we did not find the correlation of EGFR,
BRAF, and KRAS mutation with sensitivity to AZD6244 (data
not shown).
STAT3 pathway regulates sensitivity of lung cancer cells
to MEK inhibitor treatment
To further test if STAT3 pathway mediated MEK inhibitor
resistance, STAT3 was knocked down in resistant cell lines
H460 and H226 (Fig. 3A), and the constitutively active form
of STAT3 was overexpressed in 2 AZD6244-sensitive cell
lines Calu6 and H1437 (Fig. 3B). However we did not observe
changes in JAK1 and IL6ST expression in the cells with
overexpression of the constitutively active form of STAT3.
Both p-STAT3 and total STAT3 were upregulated in H460
cells after treatment with AZD6244 at time points up to 72
hours (Fig. 3C). SRB assay were carried out to assess the
responses to AZD6244 in cells with STAT3 knockdown or
overexpression. The results showed that knockdown of
STAT3 in H460 and H226 cells significantly sensitized the
cells to AZD6244 (Fig. 3D). Knockdown of STAT3 decreased
IC50 values from more than 50 mmol/L to less than 1 mmol/L
in both the H460 and H226 cell lines. Activation of the STAT3
pathway in 2 sensitive cell lines, Calu6 and H1437, with the
constitutively active form of STAT3 induced resistance to

activation of the STAT3 pathway caused MEK inhibitor
resistance in lung cancer cells.
STAT3 inhibitor JSI-124 sensitized lung cancer cell to
AZD6244 in vitro and in vivo
To determine whether combining AZD6244 with a small
molecule STAT3 inhibitor could overcome MEK inhibitor
resistance, we tested inhibition of p-STAT3 in H460 cells
with different doses of JSI-124, a STAT3 inhibitor (19), and
results showed that 50 nmol/L JSI-124 inhibited p-STAT3
levels by approximately 80% (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, inhibition of the STAT3 pathway with 20 and 40 nmol/L JSI-124
significantly sensitized the resistant cell lines H460 and
H226 to AZD6244 (P < 0.05; Fig. 4B and C). We also tested
several other resistant cell lines, including H2882, HCC827,
HCC193, and HCC515, and in all cell lines tested, treatment
with a very low concentration of JSI-124 (40 nmol/L)
sensitized cells to AZD6244 (data not shown). To confirm
these results in vivo, a study was carried out in a mouse
human xenograft lung tumor model derived from the H460
cell lines. Combination treatment with AZD6244 and JSI124 significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to
treatment with each drug alone (Fig. 4D and E). We also
observed that JSI-124 alone has some effect on the tumor
growth inhibition, which was consistent with a previous
report (19). Immunohistochemical staining further confirmed that p-ERK and p-STAT3 were significantly inhibited in animal tumor tissue specimens treated with
AZD6244, JSI-124, or both compared with that treated with
vehicle, indicating that both targets of AZD6244 and JSI124 can be effectively inhibited with the combination
treatment in vivo (Fig. 4F).

Combination of JSI-124 and AZD6244 induced cell
apoptosis through BIM
To further analyze how JSI-124 sensitized the resistant
cells to AZD6244 treatment, cell cycle analysis was carried
out. The results showed that a substantial amount of cell
apoptosis was induced by combination treatment with
AZD6244 and JSI-124 and not by treatment with AZD6244
alone (Fig. 5A). JSI-124 (50 nmol/L) had no effect on the
levels of p-AKT, p-JNK, or pp38MAPK (Fig. 5B). Previous
studies indicated that induction of BIM expression is a
critical step in MEK inhibitor–induced cell apoptosis (20–
22). To determine whether apoptosis induction by combination treatment with JSI-124 and AZD6244 is also due to BIM
induction, Western blotting was carried out to assess BIM
expression in cells treated with AZD6244 alone or combination with JSI-124. The results showed that neither AZD6244
nor JSI-124 alone induced BIM expression in H460 cells,
whereas combination treatment with both dramatically
induced BIM expression, including BIM-EL, BIM-L, and
BIM-SL, in the H460 resistant cell line (Fig. 5C). BIM-EL
in particular showed the greatest upregulation in cells with
combination treatment. Results also showed that combination treatment with JSI-124 and AZD6244 induced cleavage
of PARP, the protein marker for cell apoptosis. However,
there was no induction of PARP cleavage in cells treated
with AZD6244 alone and only minimal induction of PARP
cleavage in cells treated with JSI-124 alone (Fig. 5C). In
addition, activation of the STAT3 pathway inhibited the
induction of BIM and PARP cleavage by AZD6244 in sensitive Calu6 cells (Fig. 5D). These results indicated that
activation of the STAT3 pathway induced resistance to
AZD6244 through inhibiting BIM induction, whereas blocking the STAT3 pathway overcame resistance to AZD6244 and

induced cell apoptosis through inducing BIM expression.
BIM is regulated by FoxO3A at the transcriptional level (23).
ERK also directly phosphorylates BIM at S69 and promotes
its degradation (24). However, inhibition of ERK alone in
MEK inhibitor–resistant cells could only induce minor BIM
expression in AZD6244 resistant cells, although p-FoxO3A
was inhibited (Fig. 5E). Inhibition of STAT3 alone had no
effect on the phosphorylation of FoxO3A and BIM (Fig. 5E)
or any effect on nuclear translocation of FoxO3A (Supplementary Fig. 1) suggesting that regulation of BIM by the
STAT3 pathway may not be through FoxO3A or phosphorylation of BIM.
STAT3 regulates BIM through miR-17
The results above showed that blocking the STAT3 pathway
sensitized resistant cells to AZD6244 by inducing cell apoptosis through BIM. However, how STAT3 cooperated with the
ERK-regulating BIM gene is unclear. One recent study found
that STAT3 regulated the expression of the miRNA cluster
miR-17-92 on the transcriptional level (25). Moreover, studies
with transgenic animal models indicated that miR-17-92
promotes cell proliferation and induces tumorigenicity
through targeting BIM expression. Thus, we hypothesized
that STAT3-mediated MEK inhibitor resistance might occur
through the upregulation of miR-17-92, which suppressed BIM
by targeting its 30 -untranslated region.

To test this hypothesis, real-time qPCR was carried out to
determine miR-17 expression in Calu6 and H1437 cells that
had overexpression of the constitutively active form STAT3
and its expression in H460 and H226 cells with STAT3 knockdown. The results of real-time PCR showed that overexpression of constitutively active STAT3 upregulated miR-17 in
Calu6 and H1437 cells, whereas knockdown of STAT3 expression in H460 and H226 cells downregulated the expression of
miR-17 (Fig. 6A). Consistent with the levels of miR-17 in cells
with STAT3 activation, BIM was downregulated at the mRNA
level (Fig. 6B), whereas inhibition of miR-17 with anti–miR-17
upregulated BIM RNA in resistant cells (Fig. 6B). To further
test whether miR-17 upregulated by STAT3 plays a role in
MEK inhibitor resistance, Calu6 and H1437 cells were transfected with miR-17 expression vector, then treated with
AZD6244 and assessed by SRB assay. The result showed that
overexpression of miR-17 in Calu6 and H1437 cells induced
resistance to AZD6244 (Fig. 6C). As it was expected, inhibition
of miR-17 with anti–miR-17 sensitized H460 and H226 cells to
treatment with AZD6244 (Fig. 6D). The result of Western
blotting further confirmed that overexpression of miR-17
inhibited the BIM expression induced by AZD6244 and inhibited the expression of PARP cleavage in MEK inhibitor–
sensitive Calu6 cells (Fig. 6E); whereas inhibition of miR-17
with anti–miR-17 combined with AZD6244 induced expression of BIM and PARP cleavage in MEK inhibitor–resistant

Discussion
In this study we tested the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 on a
panel of 38 NSCLC cell lines that have been characterized with
respect to gene copy number, gene expression, mutation, and
protein expression profiles. In our analysis of gene expression
profiles, we found one group of genes correlated with MEK

inhibitor resistance and another group of genes correlated
with MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Analyzing the genes that were
significantly correlated with sensitivity or resistance to MEK
inhibitors using IPA software, we identified that activation of
the STAT3 pathway was associated with MEK inhibitor resistance.
Recently, using a similar gene expression profiling
approach, Dry and colleagues also identified that higher levels
of IL6 correlated with resistance to MEK inhibition, indicating
that the STAT3 pathway may mediate AZD6244 resistance
(26). Although we did not find IL6 to be one of the genes

correlated with MEK inhibitor resistance in our study, JAK1,
IL6ST, and LIMO4, which are related to JAK-STAT3 pathways, were correlated with MEK inhibitor resistance. JAK1
and IL6ST are molecules directly upstream of STAT3. Overexpression of JAK1 and IL6ST can directly activate STAT3
(27, 28). LIMO4 can bind to and activate IL6ST, thus activating the STAT3 pathway (29). Higher levels of JAK1, IL6ST,
and LIMO4 might at least partly contribute to the STAT3
activation and thus induce MEK inhibitor resistance.
Another recent study by Yoon and colleagues showed that
feedback activation of STAT3 by MEK inhibitor in the KRAS
mutated lung cancer cells results in MEK inhibitor resistance, also indicating agreement with our study (30). We
further confirmed that inhibition of the STAT3 pathway with
STAT3-specific siRNA, or with JSI-124, a STAT3-specific

inhibitor sensitized lung cancer cells to MEK inhibitor
treatment in vitro and in vivo.
The STAT3 pathway has been shown to be activated in
many types of cancer and is associated with cancer transformation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis and with
immune system suppression (31, 32). In this study, we found
that the combination of AZD6244 and JSI-124 induced cell
apoptosis through inducing dramatic BIM expression and
PARP cleavage, whereas activation of the STAT3 pathway
by overexpression of constitutively active STAT3 in the sensitive cell lines blocked BIM expression and apoptosis induction. Induction of BIM by simultaneous inhibition of the ERK
and STAT3 pathways is consistent with previous reports that
induction of BIM expression is required for tumor suppression
mediated by MEK inhibitors (20, 33). BIM is regulated by both

the AKT and MAPK pathways on the transcriptional level
through FoxO3A (23, 34–36). ERK also can directly phosphorylate BIM and thereby promote its degradation (37, 38).
However our results showed that JSI-124, a STAT3 inhibitor,
has no effect on p-FoxO3A or p-BIM suggesting that STAT3
regulates BIM by other mechanisms.
Recent studies have shown that BIM was regulated not only
at the transcriptional and protein levels but also at the
posttranscriptional level. Several studies have indicated that
miR-17 promotes tumorigenicity by inhibiting cell apoptosis
through targeting BIM and PTEN (39–41). Importantly, miR17 has been reported to be highly expressed in lung cancer and
to promote the proliferation of cancer cells (42) and to be
regulated by STAT3 (25). Recent studies have indicated that

miRNAs are also involved in resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents and possibly to target therapeutic agents as well (43,
44). In this study we found that upregulation of miR-17-92 by
activation of the STAT3 pathway induced MEK inhibitor
resistance, whereas simultaneous inhibition of the MEK
and STAT3 pathways or miR-17 significantly sensitized resistant cells to AZD6244 treatment by upregulating BIM. Our
results not only provide insight into the molecular mechanism
of MEK inhibitor resistance but also indicate novel alternative
approaches for overcoming the MEK inhibitor resistance by
combining AZD6244 with miRNA inhibitors. Given that
STAT3 inhibitors have serious adverse effects, small-molecule
RNA-based miRNA inhibitors have the advantage of less
toxicity and will be promising in future cancer treatment

either as single agents or in combination with other therapeutic drugs.
In summary, using biochemical and biological methods we
identified that the activation of STAT3 pathways mediates
MEK inhibitor resistance. We further found that STAT3mediated MEK inhibitor resistance occurs through the inhibition of BIM by miRNA-17. Our results suggest that the
combination of a small molecule–based inhibitor with a
STAT3 inhibitor or a miR-17 inhibitor may be a productive
approach for lung cancer therapy.
