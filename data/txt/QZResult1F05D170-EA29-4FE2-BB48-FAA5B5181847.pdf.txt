ABSTRACT
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most leading causes of cancer-related
deaths worldwide. Although recent advances provide various treatment options,
pancreatic adenocarcinoma has poor prognosis due to its late diagnosis and ineffective
therapeutic multimodality. Gemcitabine is the effective first-line drug in pancreatic
adenocarcinoma treatment. However, gemcitabine chemoresistance of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cells has been a major obstacle for limiting its treatment effect. Our
study found that p70S6K1 plays an important role in gemcitabine chemoresistance.
MiR-145 is a tumor suppressor which directly targets p70S6K1 for inhibiting its
expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, providing new therapeutic scheme. Our
findings revealed a new mechanism underlying gemcitabine chemoresistance in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells.

scanty of clinically effects for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
In addition, only less than 20% pancreatic adenocarcinoma
patients are sensitive to gemcitabine treatment, remaining
the major challenge for pancreatic adenocarcinoma
treatments [5]. Thus, it will contribute to the development
of a novel therapeutic strategy to explore the mechanisms
underlying gemcitabine resistance and enhance the
efficacy of gemcitabine in pancreatic adenocarcinoma
treatment [6].
P70S6K1, one of the most important downstream
targets of mTOR, can be activated by the PI3K/PTEN/
AKT signaling pathway and functions as a key regulator
in various cellular functions such as cell cycle, cell
apoptosis and chemoresistance [7]. Given the significant
role of p70S6K1 in cellular functions, p70S6K1 is proven
to be the multifunctional hallmark in cancer therapy [8].
In addition, recent studies demonstrated that p70S6K1 is
involved in nucleotide synthesis via regulating enzymatic

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading
cause of cancer-related death around the world with
extremely poor prognosis [1]. The five-year survival rate
for pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients is approximately
6%, with a median survival of 4-6 months. Thus,
pancreatic adenocarcinoma is often diagnostic after it is
well-advanced because of its asymptomatic nature [2].
Less than 15% pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients are
suitable for operation at the time of diagnosis, which means
chemotherapy has been the major treatment for most of
the pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients [3]. Gemcitabine
(2’-deoxy-2’-difluorodeoxycytidine),
a
nucleoside
analog, has been confirmed to be the first effective drug in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma treatment by inhibiting DNA
synthesis and stimulating apoptosis of cancer cells [4].
The gemcitabine-related therapy is the medical treatment

[9, 10], indicating the potential role of p70S6K1 in
gemcitabine action.
MicroRNAs are small non-coding regulatory
RNAs that have been confirmed to participate in human
tumorigenesis by directly targeting tumor related genes
[11, 12]. Recent studies in pancreatic adenocarcinoma
show indispensable roles of miRNAs in various cellular
functions, for example, miRNA-21, miRNA-33a,
miRNA-155 and miRNA-218 exhibit important roles in
tumor proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis
[13]. However, only a few miRNAs were identified to
be involved in gemcitabine chemoresistance, such as
miR-21, miR-181b and miR-17-92 cluster [14–16].
MiRNA-145 has been known as a tumor suppressor which
is frequently downregulated in various types of cancer
including breast cancer [17], colon cancer [18], prostate
cancer [19], bladder cancer [20], and osteosarcomas [21].
Although some studies indicate the oncogenic potential
of miR-145 in SW620 cells showing increasing cell
proliferation/metabolic activity, miRNA-145 participates
in cancer development mostly by targeting significant
oncogenes and effectively suppressing their expression
in different signal pathways, thus inhibiting cancer cell
proliferation, invasion and metastasis or enhancing
chemosensitivity [22, 23]. Characterization of global
microRNA expression reveals anticancer potential of miR145 in metastatic colorectal cancer. Early evidence from
our lab demonstrated that miR-145 negatively regulated
p70S6K1 expression at the posttranscriptional level in
colon cancer [18]. Here we demonstrate that miR-145
increases sensitivity of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells
to gemcitabine treatment, providing new insights into
the role of miR-145/P70S6K1 in mediating gemcitabine
chemosensitivity.

study. When Bxpc-3 and Panc-1 cells were exposed
to gemcitabine treatment at different concentrations,
expression levels of miR-145 were increased in a dosedependent manner in Bxpc-3 cells, whereas there was no
significant change on miR-145 expression in Panc-1 cells
(Figure 1D and 1E), suggesting that miR-145 expression
was substantially up-regulated by gemcitabine treatment
in gemcitabine-sensitive cells and the block of miR-145
enhancement in gemcitabine-resistant cells may be a
potential mechanism for gemcitabine chemoresistance.

MiR-145 is involved in cell migration and
gemcitabine chemosensitivity in pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cells
Stable cell lines over-expressing miR-145 or
negative control miRNA (miR-NC) were established using
lentivirus carrying miR-145 or miR-NC, and verified by
detecting the expression of miR-145 levels in Bxpc-3 and
Panc-1 cells (Figure 2A). One of the key characteristics
of malignant tumor is migration, we next investigated the
effects of miR-145 over-expression on migration in vitro.
Forced expression of miR-145 dramatically inhibited 65%
and 50% cell migration capacity of Bxpc-3 and Panc-1
cells, respectively (Figure 2B and 2C). The miR-145overexpressing pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were
used to analyze cell viability upon gemcitabine treatment.
The results showed that over-expression of miR-145 in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells significantly increased
the sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment (Figure 2D and
2E). To examine the basal levels of miR-145 expression
in these cell lines, we found that compared with Panc-1,
Bxpc3 has higher expression levels of miR-145. Therefore,
we knocked down miR-145 in Bxpc-3 cells to further
verify the biological function of miR-145. We found that
miR-145 interference effectively increased the viability
of Bxpc-3 cells upon gemcitabine treatment (Figure 2F),
and cell proliferation was enhanced by miR-145 inhibition
under the treatment of gemcitabine in Bxpc-3 cells (Figure
2G). Furthermore, Transwell assay showed that miR-145
interference enhanced the migration of Bxpc-3 cells.

RESULTS
Gemcitabine treatment induces miR-145 upregulation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells
To identify miRNAs whose expression levels were
altered in pancreatic cells in response to gemcitabine
treatment, we used CCK8 assay to test the effective
concentrations of gemcitabine treatment in Bxpc-3 and
Panc-1 cells, and found out that Bxpc-3 was sensitive,
whereas Panc-1 was resistant to gemcitabine treatment,
with more than 100-fold higher IC50 in Panc-1 cells
(Figure 1A and 1B). After determining the appropriate
gemcitabine concentrations in these cell lines, we treated
Bxpc-3 cells with gemcitabine (2.5 μM) or vehicle control,
and quantified miRNA expression profile by using qRTPCR analysis. We observed that miR-145 was the most
significantly up-regulated miRNA upon treatment (Figure
1C), thus we selected miR-145 as a candidate miRNA
in tumor progression and chemotherapy for further

P70S6K1 is a direct target of miR-145
Growing evidence indicates that p70S6K1 pathway
is involved in cell growth, metastasis and drug resistance.
Bioinformatics program was used to predict targets of
miR-145, among which p70S6K1 was one of the putative
targets of miR-145. Next, we examined whether p70S6K1
is a direct target of miR-145. The sequences of p70S6K1
3’-UTR region with miR-145 potential binding site was
shown in Figure 3A. To verify whether miR-145 directly
targets p70S6K1, p70S6K1 3′-UTR sequences containing
putative binding sites of wild type (WT) or the mutant one
(mut) (Figure 3A) were cloned into pMIR-REPORTER
vector. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the wild

measured. Overexpression of miR-145 significantly
inhibited the luciferase activities of wild-type, but not
mutant p70S6K1 3'-UTR reporter in HER293T cells
(Figure 3B), suggesting that miR-145 targets p70S6K1
through the binding to the seed sequence of its 3’-UTR. To
determine whether p70S6K1 was down-regulated under
gemcitabine treatment, Bxpc-3 cells were treated with
gemcitabine for 48 h and the protein levels of p70S6K1,
p-S6, HIF-1α and GAPDH were examined. We found that
the levels of p70S6K1, p-S6 and HIF-1α were significantly
suppressed in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C). In
addition, miR-145 over-expression markedly suppressed
protein expression levels of p70S6K1, p-S6, HIF1α and VEGF in pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 3D),
confirming that miR-145 targets p70S6K1 and inhibits
relative signaling molecules in these cells. Consistent
with HIF-1α and VEGF protein down-regulation in miR145-overexpressing Bxpc-3 and Panc-1 cells, forced
expression also suppressed VEGF mRNA levels in these
cells (Figure 3E). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 3F,
we measured mRNA levels of miR-145 and p70S6K1 in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumor tissues and determined
the correlation between p70S6K1 levels and miR-145
expression levels (Figure 3F). Spearman’s rank correlation
analysis showed that expression levels of p70S6K1 and

inversely correlated (Spearman’s correlation r = -0.5361).

Overexpression of p70S6K1 reverses the
inhibitory effect of miR-145 on cell migration
and chemoresistance
To identify potential molecular mechanism of
miR-145 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma development
and treatment resistance, we determined whether
miR-145 inhibited cell migration and cell viability
under gemcitabine treatment though p70S6K1. The
overexpression of miR-145 decreased endogenous
p70S6K1 protein levels, whereas forced expression
of p70S6K1 without 3’-UTR dramatically increased
p70S6K1 expression levels (Figure 4A). Over-expression
of p70S6K1 rescued the ability of cell migration
which was suppressed by miR-145 over-expression in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines (Figure 4B and
4C). Furthermore, cell growth rate in the presence of
gemcitabine was assayed by CCK-8 proliferation assay
at different time points. Our results showed that the
restoration of p70S6K1 expression in the cells stably overexpressing miR-145 significantly increased gemcitabine
chemoresistance (Figure 4D). To further study whether
p70S6K1 is required for gemcitabine-resistance in
pancreatic cancer cells, we confirmed that knockdown
of p70S6K1 using its shRNA significantly increased cell

first-line treatment drug of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, is
widely used in clinical practice. Currently, some literatures
suggest that miRNAs can affect drug sensitivity of tumor
cells to gemcitabine treatment, including miR-218, miR33a and miR-223 [24–26], but the role and molecular
mechanism of miRNAs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells
to gemcitabine treatment have not been reported. We found
that compared with Bxpc-3, a much higher concentration
of gemcitabine was required to inhibit the cell viability of
Panc-1, confirming that Panc-1 is a gemcitabine-resistant
cell line. We also found that gemcitabine could up-regulate
expression levels of miR-145 in Bxpc-3, the gemcitabinesensitive cells, but not in Panc-1 cells, suggesting specific
role of miR-145 in gemcitabine chemosensitivity in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells.
MiR-145 is known as a tumor suppressor, which
plays an important role in tumor development. The
expression levels of miR-145 are found to be downregulated in many types of cancers, including pancreatic
adenocarcinoma [27–31]. The expression profiles and
biological role of miR-145 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma
has been reported [31, 32], but the role and mechanisms
of miR-145 in regulating drug resistance remain to
be elucidated. In this study, we found that in both
gemcitabine-sensitive cells Bxpc-3 and gemcitabineresistant cells Panc-1, overexpression of miR-145
significantly inhibited cell migration by directly targeting
p70S6K1. Moreover, overexpression of miR-145
increased chemosensitivity of cancer cells to gemcitabine
treatment in vitro, indicated by decreased cell viability.
Furthermore, p70S6K1 is a direct target of miR-145 in
pancreatic cancer cells. Forced expression of p70S6K1

MiR-145 inhibits VEGF transcriptional
activation through targeting p70S6K1 in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells
Previous studies have shown the importance of
p70S6K1/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway in the regulation of
angiogenesis and tumor progression. It has been reported
that HIF-1α activates the expression of VEGF gene by
binding to the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the
VEGF promoter region. To determine whether miR145 attenuates VEGF transcriptional activation through
targeting p70S6K1, we analyzed the effect of miR145 on the wild type VEGF promoter reporter plasmid
(pMAP11WT) containing the HIF-1α binding site or the
mutant plasmid (pMAP11Mut) with or without p70S6K1
over-expression. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, forced
expression of p70S6K1 restored miR-145-inhibited the
wild type VEGF reporter activity in Bxpc-3 and Panc1 cells, but did not affect the mutant reporter activity,
indicating that miR-145 inhibits VEGF transcriptional
activation by targeting p70S6K1.

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most
common digestive tract malignant tumors, which is
difficult in early diagnosis and treatment. In present,
distant metastasis, relapse, and drug resistance are still
very difficult problems in cancer therapy. Gemcitabine, a

reversed miR-145-suprressed cell proliferation and drug
resistance of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting
that p70S6K1 plays a central role in miR-145-induced
chemosensitivity to gemcitabine treatment. MiR-143 may
have similar effect and regulation mechanism as miR-145
in cells, which would also be interesting to be studied in
the future.
The activation of p70S6K1 affects the expression
levels of two important angiogenesis-related downstream
signaling molecules, HIF-1α and VEGF, which are
involved in tumorigenesis and cancer development [33–
37]. It has also been demonstrated that HIF-1α regulates
VEGF expression at the transcriptional level by binding to
its promoter [38]. In our study, overexpression of miR-145
suppressed the expression levels of HIF-1α and VEGF,
which is consistent with its inhibitory effect on p70S6K1.
Furthermore, forced expression of p70S6K1 in miR-145over-expressing pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells restored
the expression levels of HIF-1α and VEGF which were
inhibited by miR-145, suggesting that miR-145 controls
expression of HIF-1a and VEGF by targeting p70S6K1
in the cells.
In summary, our findings showed that Panc-1
resistance to gemcitabine is due to the down-regulation
of miR-145, suggesting that miR-145 may be an indicator
for the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Forced expression of miR-145 inhibited the cell viability,
migration, HIF-1α, VEGF expression and enhanced
the chemosensitivity to gemcitabine through its direct
target p70S6K1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These
results suggest that miR-145 may be a potential target
for adjuvant therapy to enhance the chemosensitivity
to gemcitabine in the future. Our findings provided a
new molecular basis for the application of miR-145 in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which may be helpful in
developing microRNA-based drug for treating pancreatic
adenocarcinoma in the future.

The 3’-UTR of p70S6K1 constructs containing
predicted miR-145 seed-matching sites from cDNA library
were amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase,
then cloned into pMIR-REPORTER vector (Ambion).
Primers of wide type (WT) and corresponding mutant
sites (Mut) used for reporter constructions were shown
in Supplementary Table S1. All the 3’-UTR products
were sequenced and verified. For reporter assays, HEK293T cells were transiently cotransfected with WT or
Mut plasmid, pRL-TK plasmid and miRNA-145 mimics
(GenePharma, Shanghai, China) or miRNA-negative
control (miR-NC) using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Firefly and renilla luciferase activities were measured
24 h after transfection using a dual luciferase assay kit
(Promega, Shanghai, China). The relative luciferase
activities were calculated and normalized to the control.
To detect the effects of miR-145 on transcriptional
activation of VEGF, the downstream of p70S6K1, VEGF
reporter plasmid pMAP11-WT or pMAP11-Mut was cotransfected into Bxpc-3 and Panc-1 cells with pRL-TK
plasmid and miR-145 mimics or miR-NC. Firefly and
Renilla luciferase activities were measured 24 h after
the transfection. Experiments were performed in three
independent replicates.

RNA extractions, reverse transcription PCR and
quantitative real time- PCR
Total RNAs were extracted from cells with TRIzol
(Invitrogen, CA, USA). The stem-loop RT-PCR assay was
performed to quantify the miRNAs expression levels using
the HiScript RT Reagent Kit (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
To determine the mRNA levels of VEGF, total RNAs
were reversely transcribed using HiScript RT Reagent
Kit (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China). RT-qPCR was
performed to detect mRNA expression levels using the
SYBR Premix DimerEraser (Takara, Dalian, China) on a
7900HT system. The expression levels of U6 or GAPDH
were used as internal control. The expression levels
of miRNAs in each group were calculated by relative
quantification (2-ΔΔCt). The primers used in this study are
shown in Supplementary Table S1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, Panc1 and Bxpc-3 were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle's medium with high glucose and RPMI-1640
medium with low glucose, respectively, and supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/
ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin). Cells were
incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Trypsin
(0.25%) solution was used to detach the cells from the
culture flask. P70S6K1 and VEGF antibodies were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). Antibodies against HIF-1α and GAPDH were
purchased from Bioworld Technology (Atlanta, Georgia,
USA). Gemcitabine was obtained from Sigma (St. Louise,
MO).

Cell proliferation
To detect the gemcitabine effects on the pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cell viability, cells were seeded into
96-well plates at 2000 per well. After cellular adhesion,
medium containing gemcitabine at different concentrations
was added to the cells. Cell viability was assessed using
the CCK8 Assay (CCK8 kit, Dojindo Laboratories,
Kumamoto, Japan) 48 h after the transfection. CCK8
reagents were prepared in fresh medium (100 μl medium
containing 10 μl CCK8 solutions) and applied to the cells.

Statistical analysis
Values were obtained from at least three independent
experiments and presented as means ± SEM. Comparison
between two groups was conducted using the t-test,
while comparisons between multiple groups of data were
performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). It was
considered to be statistically significant at P<0.05.

Cell migration assay
Transwell chambers (24-well insert; Corning, NY,
USA) were used to analyze cell migration in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were seeded in
the upper well of the chamber in DMEM or RPMI-1640
medium without serum, while the lower chamber well
contained DMEM or RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS to stimulate cell migration. After
incubation for 12 h, cells on the upper membrane surface
were removed while the bottom cells were fixed with
3% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet,
and 5-6 random fields were collected for quantification
for each well. The cells were finally extracted with 33%
acetic acid and detected quantitatively using a standard
microplate reader (at 570 nm). Three independent
experiments were performed for each experimental group.

cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Open
Biosystems, AL, USA). Stable Bxpc-3 and Panc-1 cells
over-expressing miR-145 or miR-NC were generated by
the infection of lentivirus (Open Biosystems), followed by
puromycin (Life Technologies) selection.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl,
100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100,
1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA, and 10 mM
NaF) supplemented with 1 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM
leupeptin, 2 mM aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM DTT, and 2 mM pepstatin.
Total proteins were collected by centrifugation at
12,000 rpm 4°C for 15 min. After quantification, 20
μg protein lysates were separated by SDS–PAGE
and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA),
membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk
for 2 h and incubated with primary antibodies. Protein
bands were detected by incubation with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and visualized with
