BACKGROUND: The effects of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition are limited by feedback reactivation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in phosphatase and tensin homologâ€“null tumors. Thus, this study tested the combination of mTOR inhibition
(everolimus) and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition (gefitinib) in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: In
phase 1, 12 patients (10 with CRPC and 2 with glioblastoma) received daily gefitinib (250 mg) with weekly everolimus (30, 50, or
70 mg). In phase 2, 27 CRPC patients received gefitinib with everolimus (70 mg). RESULTS: Phase 1 revealed no pharmacokinetic
interactions and no dose-limiting toxicities. In phase 2, 18 of 27 patients (67%) discontinued treatment before the 12-week evaluation
because of progression as evidenced by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (n 5 6) or imaging (n 5 5) or because of a grade 2 or
higher toxicity (n 5 7). Thirteen of the 37 CRPC patients (35%) exhibited a rapidly rising PSA level after they had begun treatment,
and this declined upon discontinuation. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 24 to 72 hours after the initiation of treatment showed a decrease in the standardized uptake value consistent with mTOR inhibition in 27 of the 33 evaluable patients (82%);
there was a corresponding rise in PSA in 20 of these 27 patients (74%). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of gefitinib and everolimus
did not result in significant antitumor activity. The induction of PSA in tumors treated with mTOR inhibitors was consistent with preclinical data showing that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway signaling feedback inhibits the androgen receptor (AR). This
clinical evidence of relief of feedback inhibition promoting enhanced AR activity supports future studies combining PI3K pathway

INTRODUCTION
A molecular profiling study of human prostate cancers showed that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling axis
was altered in 42% of primary tumor samples and in 100% of metastatic castration-resistant tumor samples.1 Therapies
directed at inhibiting the PI3K axis such as LY294002 and wortmannin have been limited by untoward adverse events,2
and this has led to the evaluation of agents that inhibit key downstream components of the pathway, such as mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR). Rapamycin binds to mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), 1 of the 2
protein complexes in which mTOR functions, and it has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in a variety of tumor
models, including those in which PI3K/AKT signaling is deregulated by phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss.3-5
Preclinical development of rapalogs with rapamycin-like mTORC1 inhibitory effects followed, but none induced tumor
regression in genetically engineered models of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. This lack of activity has been mirrored in
the clinic, where the effects of rapamycin-like TORC1 inhibitors in human prostate tumors in which a loss of PTEN is
prevalent have been modest at best.6-8
The lack of antitumor activity in prostate tumors treated with rapamycin and other PI3K pathway inhibitors may be
due in part to activation of upstream signaling pathways (Fig. 1). Activation of AKT and mTOR has been shown to

Figure 1. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway: relief of feedback inhibition on RTK signaling. Activation of AKT and mTOR has been
shown to feedback-inhibit the activation, expression, and signaling of a variety of RTKs, including members of the EGFR family,
IGF1R, HER2/3, and others.9 Rapamycin-like drugs can relieve this feedback and activate RTKs and thereby attenuate the antitumor effect of these drugs. Inhibition of PI3K can activate AR through the relief of negative feedback on RTKs. Conversely, inhibition of AR activates AKT by reducing levels of the AKT phosphatase PHLPP. AR indicates androgen receptor; EGFR, epidermal

feedback-inhibit a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs),9 but rapamycin-like drugs relieve this feedback
and activate RTKs. It has been suggested that this attenuates or prevents the antitumor effects of these drugs.
Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitors as monotherapy have been ineffective in patients
with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)10-12
because mTOR inhibition reactivates human epidermal
growth factor receptor kinase signals, we hypothesized that
inhibition of EGFR signaling might enhance the effects of
mTOR inhibition.13,14 This study tested whether combined inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR and EGFR signaling
pathways with everolimus and gefitinib would potentiate
the response for patients with CRPC.
It is worth noting that when this study was initially
designed, the reciprocal feedback relation between the
androgen receptor (AR) and PI3K signaling pathways was
not well defined; publications citing preclinical data for
this phenomenon came later.15,16 Our hypothesis at the
time of this trial was that a rising prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) level in the setting of mTOR inhibition would be
related to disease progression, potentially through relief of
negative feedback inhibition on the EGFR pathway,
3854

which prompted this combination study.13,14 We later
realized that in some instances, the paradoxical rise of PSA
in response to treatment was clinical evidence demonstrating the relief of feedback inhibition by everolimus on the
AR signaling pathway.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

This registered phase 1/2 study (NCT00085566 at ClinicalTrials.gov) was approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center institutional review board. All
subjects (patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer or progressive glioblastoma multiforme [GBM]) provided written informed consent.
Phase 1 consisted of a single-agent lead-in period to
assess the pharmacokinetics of everolimus and gefitinib
separately and in combination with a weekly oral dose of
30, 50 or 70 mg of everolimus (based on preclinical and
clinical analysis17,18) and a fixed oral daily dose of 250 mg
of gefitinib. Twelve patients (10 with CRPC and 2 with
GBM) were enrolled in phase 1; they received a single
dose of everolimus on day 1 of week 1 and then, beginning in week 2, received only gefitinib at 250 mg per day

for 2 consecutive weeks. Combination therapy began in
week 4. The 30- and 50-mg everolimus cohorts contained
3 patients each, whereas the 70-mg cohort had 6 patients.
Patients were monitored for toxicity for 28 days from the
beginning of combination therapy before the treatment of
a cohort began at the next everolimus dose level. The primary objective of the phase 1 portion was to define the
tolerability of everolimus when it was administered in
combination with a fixed dose of gefitinib. The probability of dose escalation depended on the dose-limiting toxicity. The 2 phase 1 GBM patients are included in the
toxicity and pharmacokinetic data reported later in the
Results section, but they are not included in the efficacy
data; their efficacy data have been reported separately.19
Phase 2 consisted of a combination of everolimus at
70 mg weekly and gefitinib at 250 mg daily on the basis of
the phase 1 results. It enrolled 27 CRPC patients and 20
GBM patients; the phase 2 GBM patients are not
included in this report because they have been reported
separately.19 For the prostate cancer cohort, the primary
objective of the phase 2 portion was to assess the efficacy
of the dose combination in patients with metastatic
CRPC. Efficacy was assessed by the proportion of patients
who showed no change (50% rise) or a decline in PSA
at 12 weeks with no radiographic20 or clinical progression.
A response rate of 25% was considered active, and a rate
of 10% was considered inactive. A Simon 2-stage design
was used in which initially 27 patients were treated; if 2 or
fewer responses were observed, the trial was to be terminated. If 3 or more responses were observed, another 13
patients were to be accrued, and the combination would
be considered worthy of further study if 7 or more
responses were observed among the 40 patients enrolled.
The design had a power of 0.90 if the population response
proportion was 0.25 with a 0.10 size test.
Patient Eligibility

Eligible prostate cancer patients had histologically confirmed metastatic CRPC with progression defined by 1 or
more of these criteria: 1) rising PSA levels showing at least
a 25% increase (minimum of 3 rising levels obtained
more than 1 week apart or 2 rising PSA values obtained
more than 1 month apart), 2) transaxial imaging showing
new or progressive (20% increase in the sum of the indicator lesions) soft-tissue masses on a computed tomography
or magnetic resonance imaging scan, and 3) bone scan
showing new metastatic lesions. Patients needed to meet
standard laboratory eligibility requirements to ensure
adequate bone marrow reserve and liver and kidney

function and a Karnofsky performance status  70%.
There were no restrictions on prior therapy for CRPC.
Patient Evaluation

Patients were assessed at biweekly intervals for toxicity
according to the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s standard
common toxicity criteria (version 3.0). Patients were provided with medication diaries, which were reviewed at
each physician visit. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as
any one of the following: 1) grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic
toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting, rash, and untreated
hyperlipidemia), 2) grade 3 diarrhea lasting more than 48
hours or grade 4 diarrhea, 3) grade 3 fatigue lasting more
than a week or grade 4 fatigue, 4) neutropenic fever, 5)
grade 4 hematologic toxicity, or 6) any toxicity causing a
treatment delay for longer than 2 weeks with one or both
agents.
Patients were assessed for efficacy at week 12 (in
phase 1, this represented week 9 of combined therapy)
and every 12 weeks thereafter (for phase 1 patients, every
8 weeks thereafter). Prostate cancer patients were assessed
with a combination of changes in PSA, measurable disease, and lesions identifiable on bone scans. The primary
endpoint was the proportion of patients who showed a
decline or no change (50% rise) in PSA at 12 weeks.
Pharmacokinetics (Phase 1 Only)

Blood samples for pharmacokinetic studies of everolimus
administered alone were obtained during the first week of
treatment on day 1: before treatment and 1, 2, 5, and 8
hours after treatment. A single blood sample for pharmacokinetic studies of gefitinib alone was obtained on week
3 day 1 (7 days after the initiation of gefitinib) to analyze
gefitinib in the steady state. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic studies of both agents were obtained on week 4
day 1 (the first day of combination therapy): before treatment and 1, 2, 5, and 8 hours after treatment. At each designated sampling time, a whole blood sample (2 mL for
everolimus alone, 4 mL for gefitinib alone, or 6 mL for
everolimus and gefitinib coadministration) was drawn
into a potassiumâ€“ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid Vacutainer tube and then centrifuged to obtain plasma, which
was shipped on dry ice to either Novartis or Avantix Laboratories for the drug concentrations to be measured. Liquid/liquid extraction of the blood samples was followed
by an analysis of the reconstituted extracts via highperformance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. The
lower limit of quantitation of the analytical method was
0.3 ng/mL with 500 mL of blood.

Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) Scans

A secondary study objective was to explore the association
between everolimus administration, clinical outcomes,
and serial FDG PET imaging. To demonstrate the pharmacodynamic effects of mTOR inhibition in the clinic
and to assess the predictive value of an early FDG PET
response with respect to the time to progression, we used
FDG PET imaging as an early measure of the on-target
effect of mTOR inhibition in tumors.21,22 A baseline scan
was obtained within the 30 days before the start of everolimus; an optional early posttreatment scan was obtained
within the 24 to 72 hours after treatment initiation; and a
third scan was requested at the week 12 response assessment or treatment discontinuation, whichever came first.
The definition of FDG PET for this trial followed the
European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer criteria, which describe a decline as a decrease in
the standardized uptake value (SUV) > 25% in comparison with prior SUV values and a progression as an
increase > 25%. In this case, we used an average of the
maximum SUV as the measured parameter; this was then
converted into a fractional decline by normalization of the
3856

SUV with respect to the baseline maximum SUV average
for each individual patient.21

Overall, 37 patients with progressive CRPC (10 in phase
1 and 27 in phase 2) were treated in this study at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between July 2004
and March 2006. Baseline characteristics are summarized
in Table 1. The majority of patients had bone metastases
(34 of 37 or 92%) and had received chemotherapy before
study entry (23 of 37 or 62%); they included 30% (11 of
37) with 3 or more prior regimens. In the phase 1 portion,
2 patients with GBM were enrolled (1 each in the 30- and
50-mg everolimus cohorts), and they have been included
in the toxicity and pharmacokinetic analysis reported
here. The 20 GBM patients participating in the phase 2
portion of the trial are not included in this article because
their data have been previously reported.19 All phase 2
patients reported here had metastatic CRPC (n 5 27).
Pharmacokinetics

The phase 1 portion of this trial had a 3-week single-agent
lead-in phase in which the individual pharmacokinetic
profiles of everolimus and gefitinib were measured. The
ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) for everolimus in
combination with gefitinib to the AUC for the same dose
of everolimus as a single agent was 1.32 for the 30-mg
everolimus dose (n 5 3), 0.99 for the 50-mg everolimus
dose (n 5 3), and 1.03 for the 70-mg everolimus dose
(n 5 6). Similarly, the ratio of the AUC for gefitinib in
combination with either 30- or 50-mg everolimus to the
AUC for the same dose of gefitinib as a single agent was
1.17 (n 5 6). These results suggest no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between everolimus and gefitinib.
Toxicity

There was no dose-limiting toxicity observed in phase 1.
Table 2 lists common toxicities for all 12 phase 1 patients
(10 with CRPC and 2 with GBM) as well as the 27
CRPC patients treated in phase 2. The most common
grade 2 or higher toxicities were fatigue (grade 2, 38%;
grade 3, 5%), which prompted 4 patients to discontinue
treatment early, and hyperglycemia (grade 2, 23%; grade
3, 8%), which did not require hospitalization.
There were only 2 episodes of grade 4 toxicity:
thrombocytopenia in a heavily pretreated patient with
advanced bone disease and renal failure likely related to
dehydration in another patient. Grade 3 nonhematologic
toxicities included renal failure attributed to dehydration

significance.
Patient Outcomes

More than half of the CRPC patients discontinued treatment early before the scheduled week 12 reassessment (23
of 37 or 62%; phase 2 only, 18 of 27 or 67%). The time
on study and the reasons for discontinuation (progression
vs toxicity) are given in Figure 2. In phase 2, 18 of 27
CRPC patients (67%) discontinued treatment before the
12-week evaluation because of disease progression as evidenced by a rise in PSA (6 patients) or imaging (5
patients) or because of grade 2 or higher toxicity (7
patients). Fifteen of the 18 patients who discontinued
treatment early in phase 2 had a rising PSA level. The median time in the study was 12 weeks (range, 6-23 weeks)
in phase 1 and 11 weeks (range, 1-21 weeks) in phase 2.
Notably, 13 of the 37 CRPC patients (35%) treated
in the study experienced an early and rapid increase in the
rate of rise in PSA on treatment; this declined after treatment was stopped (Fig. 3).
Overall, 14 CRPC patients in phase 1 and phase 2
remained in the study for at least 12 weeks, and 8 of these
patients (57%) showed a best response of stable disease on

imaging. Among these patients, 6 (2 in phase 1 and 4 in
phase 2) met the protocol criteria for a favorable outcome
of a decline or no change (50% rise) in PSA at 12 weeks
with no other signs of radiographic or clinical progression.
No patient had a >30% decline in PSA, and this was not
durable because 3 patients (2 in phase 1 and 1 in phase 2)
showed disease progression on a bone scan by week 23,
and 1 phase 2 patient discontinued treatment because of
rising PSA levels at week 13. The remaining 2 patients discontinued treatment by week 15 on account of toxicity.
Because the overall outcomes demonstrated limited antitumor activity with a best response of stable disease and
the majority of patients discontinued treatment before the
scheduled 12-week reassessment, a decision was made by
the investigators to terminate the study instead of expanding accrual.
FDG PET Scan Results

Because mTOR directly stimulates glucose uptake and glycolysis by enhancing both transcription and translation of
glucose transporter 1 messenger RNA, FDG PET scans
were performed as an exploratory pharmacodynamic
marker of mTOR inhibition.23-25 The FDG PET scans in
the trial were performed at the baseline, 24 to 72 hours after
the start of treatment to assess the pharmacodynamic effect
of everolimus alone, and at 12 weeks. The majority of
patients discontinued the study before the 12-week assessment because of disease progression or an adverse event.
Overall, baseline and 24- to 72-hour FDG PET
imaging was performed for 33 of the 37 patients, and 21
of these patients also had end-of-treatment FDG PET
imaging performed. At the 24- to 72-hour FDG PET
assessment, 27 of 33 evaluable patients (82%) showed
some degree of SUV decline; 20 of these 27 patients
(74%) with an early SUV decline demonstrated a rise in
PSA (Fig. 4). The early declines in FDG accumulation at
24 to 72 hours were consistent with mTOR inhibition,
but the declines were not durable because SUV increased
to the baseline or higher at the next imaging time point,
and they were not associated with favorable PSA outcomes
or an overall response. Both early responders (those experiencing SUV declines) and nonresponders remained in
the study for an average of 11 weeks.
DISCUSSION
This phase 1/2 trial of everolimus in combination with
gefitinib in patients with metastatic CRPC was based on
preclinical evidence demonstrating that resistance to
EGFR inhibition could be reversed through pharmacologic downregulation of constitutive PI3K/Akt pathway

Figure 2. Time on study, maximal percent PSA change from the baseline during the study, and reasons for discontinuation in
prostate cancer patients (n 5 37). Thirty-seven patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated during the study
(10 in phase 1 and 27 in phase 2). The median time in the study was 12 weeks in phase 1 and 11 weeks in phase 2. The majority of
the patients (5 in phase 1 and 18 in phase 2) discontinued treatment before the planned 12-week evaluation because of disease
progression, which was determined by imaging and/or a rise in the PSA level (15 patients: 4 in phase 1 and 11 in phase 2), or a
grade 2 or higher toxicity (8 patients: 1 in phase 1 and 7 in phase 2). We examined the greatest percent PSA change from the
baseline for each patient at any time during the study: this constituted a PSA rise for 31 patients (range, 10%-773%) and a PSA
decline for 5 patients (range, 23% to 236%). The maximal percent change could not be calculated for 1 patient who discontinued
treatment after only 1 week in the study. For the 5 patients whose maximal PSA change was a decline, the median time in the
study was 15 weeks. NA indicates not available; POD, progression of disease; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; TOX, toxicity.

activation. Although 6 patients in phase 2 met the
protocol-defined criteria for a favorable outcome of a
decline or no change (50% rise) in PSA at 12 weeks, in
the setting of limited antitumor activity with a best
response of stable disease in 8 patients (22%) and with a
high rate of treatment discontinuation before the 12-week
reassessment interval (62%), a decision was made by the
investigators to terminate the study early.
Early discontinuation of treatment was frequent and
most often due to disease progression in this heavily pretreated population (30% of the patients had 3 or more
prior chemotherapy regimens) rather than drug-related
toxicity; this offers some further evidence of a lack of clinical efficacy. It should be noted, however, that this trial was
conducted before the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2
recommendation that patients not be taken off therapy
for PSA progression alone26; in retrospect, it is clear that
our efficacy data were limited by the early discontinuation
of many patients due to PSA progression, and this may in
3858

part have been related to reciprocal feedback on AR in
response to mTOR inhibition.
Importantly, 13 of 37 CRPC patients (35%) exhibited a rapidly rising PSA level after they had started everolimus and gefitinib, and this declined upon discontinuation
of treatment (Fig. 3). The rise and fall of PSA in these
patients in response to treatment initiation and discontinuation suggest that the therapy caused an increase in tumor
growth and/or an increase in AR-dependent or -independent expression of PSA. After the generation of these clinical
data, we showed that AR transcriptional activity is repressed
in prostate tumors with PI3K activation.15 Moreover, in
preclinical models, we showed that this is due to PI3Kinduced feedback inhibition of AR, which is relieved by
inhibitors of PI3K signaling. In these models, mTOR inhibition reactivates AR activity and AR-dependent transcription in an RTK-dependent manner. The induction of PSA
seen in this study in response to treatment is consistent
with preclinical data showing that PI3K/AKT/mTOR

signaling feedback inhibits AR in prostate cancer, and it
suggests the potential efficacy of combining PI3K pathway
inhibitors and second-generation AR inhibitors.
Because the induction of AR activation in response
to PI3K inhibition is likely to prevent or weaken any antitumor response, the recent development of improved AR

for patients with CRPC. In addition, preclinical work by
our group has shown that reactivation of AR in tumors
exposed to PI3K pathway inhibition is mediated, at least
in part, by reactivation of RTKs.9,15,27 In this study, combining gefitinib with everolimus did not prevent PSA
induction, nor was the combination associated with antitumor activity. It is possible that inhibition of other, more
functionally important receptors alone or in combination
with EGFR inhibition will be more effective.
Recognizing the difficulty of obtaining metastatic
CRPC from bone for molecular analysis, the disease heterogeneity, and the lack of validation assays at the time of
this study for the targets of interest in bone specimens (ie,
PTEN), we performed FDG PET imaging to assess the
on-target effect of everolimus. During the FDG PET
assessment at 24 to 72 hours, 27 of 33 evaluable patients
(82%) showed some degree of SUV decline in comparison
with the baseline that was consistent with mTOR inhibition (Fig. 4), but this early SUV decline seen in the majority of patients was not durable and did not predict an
overall response. Twenty of these 27 patients (74%) with
an early decline in SUV had a corresponding rise in PSA
at the 4-week assessment, and this suggested the possibility of activation of compensatory pathways contributing
to cell survival in response to abrogation of mTOR signaling. However, our ability to collect and usefully interpret
the FDG PET data was limited by the large number of

Figure 4. FDG PET (% SUV) and PSA (%) changes from the baseline in cycle 1 of the treatment. FDG PET imaging was performed
24 to 72 hours after the initiation of treatment as a pharmacodynamic marker of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition. The
early FDG SUV declines in 27 of the 33 evaluable patients (82%) were consistent with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition
and corresponded to a week 4 rise in PSA in 20 of the 27 patients (74%). FDG PET data at 24 to 72 hours were not available for
2 phase 1 patients and 2 phase 2 patients. Week 4 PSA data were not available for 1 phase 2 patient. FDG indicates fluorodeoxyglucose; PET, positron emission tomography; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; SUV, standardized uptake value.

patients who stopped treatment early because of PSA
progression.
This study presents confirmatory evidence showing
that reciprocal feedback inhibition is a clinically relevant
phenomenon. Although the combination of everolimus
and gefitinib was ineffective, we postulate that
everolimus-induced relief of feedback inhibition
enhanced AR activity in a subset of patients; this supports
the need for rational combinations of targeted agents to
overcome compensatory signaling pathways and provide
meaningful antitumor activity. Future interventions targeting the PI3K axis in patients with CRPC include selective PI3K and AKT inhibitors, which are now in early
clinical development, mTOR kinase inhibitors that are
effective against both mTORC1 and mTORC2, and further exploration of combined AR/growth factor/AKT
pathway inhibition.
