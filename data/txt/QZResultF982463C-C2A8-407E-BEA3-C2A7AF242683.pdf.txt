ABSTRACT
Niacin, also known as vitamin B3 or nicotinamide is a water-soluble vitamin
that is present in black beans and rice among other foods. Niacin is well known as
an inhibitor of metastasis in human breast carcinoma cells but the effect of niacin
treatment on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is unknown. Here, we show that niacin plays
an important role in the regulation of autophagic flux and protects tumor cells against
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Our results indicated that niacin activated autophagic flux
in human colon cancer cells and the autophagic flux activation protected tumor cells
from TRAIL-induced dysfunction of mitochondrial membrane potential and tumor cell
death. We also demonstrated that ATG5 siRNA and autophagy inhibitor blocked the
niacin-mediated inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our study is
the first report demonstrating that niacin inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis through
activation of autophagic flux in human colon cancer cells. And our results also suggest
that autophagy inhibitors including genetic and pharmacological tools may be a
successful therapeutics during anticancer therapy using TRAIL.

apoptotic signaling has been implicated in a variety of
diseases [9, 10]. Apoptosis-related factors such as fas and
caspases enhance apoptosis, whereas several members of
the Bcl-2 family inhibit apoptosis [11, 12].
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL), a member of the TNF super family,
is a potential cancer therapeutic agent that can induce
apoptosis [13–15]. Recent studies found that binding of
TRAIL to death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5 induces DR
clustering, and subsequent recruitment of FADD and
activation of caspase-8 induces apoptosis [16]. TRAIL
also binds to decoy receptors 1 and 2, which inhibits
the induction of apoptosis [17]. Cell surface death
receptors, including DR4 and DR5, induce apoptosis
through DISC, which recruits the protease caspase-8
[18]. Increased death receptor expression is associated
with survival in patients with colon cancer [19, 20].
TRAIL has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death
in various cancer cells by binding to DR4 and DR5
to activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway [21]; in
contrast, most normal cells are relatively resistant to
TRAIL treatment [22, 23].

INTRODUCTION
Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, niacinamide
and nicotinamide, is a water-soluble vitamin that humans
are unable to synthesize in sufficient amounts [1].
Nicotinamide can block drug-induced apoptosis in human
cortical neuronal cells [2]. An absence of niacin causes
the deficiency disease pellagra, dementia, diarrhea, and
skin problems such as dermatitis [3]. Treatment with
niacin has the potential to impair genomic stability and
enhances the risk for cancer by regulation of intracellular
calcium signaling pathways [4]. Niacin enhances the
NAD+/NADH ratio and induces therapeutic normalization
of NAD+/NADH balance through autophagy in human
breast adenocarcinoma cells [5]. Moreover, treatment with
niacin activates the PI3K/Akt cascade in the A431 human
epithelial carcinoma cell line [6].
Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death
that occurs in multicellular organisms and is associated
with changes in cell morphology such as blebbing, cell
shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation,
and chromosomal DNA fragmentation [7, 8]. Defective

Treatment with TRAIL has been shown to induce
autophagy-dependent cell death in TRAIL-resistant cancer
cells [24, 25]. Beclin 1, a known key factor in autophagy, has
important roles in the crosstalk with anti-apoptotic proteins
such as BCL-2 [26]. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation
process that can mediate cell death and cell survival [27].
Autophagy prevents cell death during hypoxia, starvation,
growth factor deprivation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress, and microbial infection [28]. However, autophagy
can also be involved in cell death resulting from caspase
activation, lysosomal membrane permeabilization, and
dysregulation of the mitochondrial membrane potential
[29]. Autophagy occurs in all nucleated type cells and the
process of autophagic flux is essential in animal, plant,
and yeast cells [30–32]. Activation of autophagy has been
shown to prevent cell death in PCa cells whereas inhibition
of autophagy enhances reagent-induced cell death [33,
34]. Autophagic cell death induced by neurodegenerative
disease is characterized by the accumulation of autophagic
organelles such as autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes
[35–37]. Basically, autophagy plays an important role in
cellular homeostasis through the degradation of long-lived
proteins, intracellular organelles, and misfolded proteins
but excessive autophagy can induce cellular destruction
[35, 36]. Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex is associated with
formation of the autophagosome and Light chain 3 (LC3,
also known as ATG8) is an autophagy marker that is
lapidated during induction of autophagic flux and is
required for autophagosome formation [38, 39]. Another
autophagy marker, p62/SQSTM1, plays an important
role in the degradation of polyubiquitinated substrates by
autophagy flux, thus causing its own degradation [40].
Recently, TRAIL-resistant cells were shown to exhibit high
autophagic flux with increased clearance of p62 protein;
however, TRAIL-sensitive cells display low autophagic flux
and accumulation of p62 [41]. Furthermore, p62/SQSTM1
binds to DISC and enhances the activation, aggregation, and
processing of caspase-8, a known pro-apoptotic factor [18].
Here, we show that niacin treatment decreased
the expression of death receptors 4 and 5 and induced
autophagy flux in human colon cancer cells. In turn,
inhibition of autophagy flux by chloroquine sensitized cells
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and increased expression of
DR4 and DR5 proteins with niacin treatment. These results
identify a mechanism by which activation of autophagy
flux induced by niacin treatment inhibits the anticancer
activity of TRAIL in human colon cancer cells.

and viability using light microscopy, crystal violet assay,
and LDH release assay. The cells were pretreated with
the indicated doses of niacin for 12 h and treated with
TRAIL for an additional 2 h. TRAIL treatment alone
significantly increased cell death, indicating that HCT116
cells are sensitive to TRAIL treatment. However, niacin
inhibited TRAIL-induced cell death in a dose-dependent
manner. The both cell morphology data and crystal violet
showed that the combination of TRAIL with niacin
decreased the number of apoptotic cells compared with
TRAIL alone (Figure 1A and Figure 1B). The niacin
and TRAIL co-treatment increased cell viability and
decreased LDH release (Figure 1C and Figure 1D). As
shown in Figure 1E, niacin and TRAIL co-treatment also
decreased production of the activated forms of apoptotic
factors, including caspase-8 and caspase-3, compared to
treatment with TRAIL alone (Figure 1E). Overall, these
data demonstrated that niacin treatment inhibits TRAILmediated apoptosis in TRAIL-sensitive HCT116 cells.

Niacin decreases expression of death receptor
proteins
TRAIL interacts with specific receptors known as
death receptor 4 (TRAIL-R1 or DR4) and death receptor
5 (TRAIL-R2 or DR5) [17, 44]. To investigate the effect
of niacin on TRAIL-related expression of death receptor
proteins we treated HCT116 cells with niacin in a dosedependent manner for 12 h and a time-dependent manner
for 2–8 h. Cell lysates were subjected to western blot
analysis to determine changes in DR4 and DR5 protein
expression (Figure 2A and Figure 2B). Western blot
analysis and immunofluorescence staining revealed that
niacin treatment decreased expression of DR4 and DR5
protein compared to control (Figure 2B and 2C).

Niacin induced activation of autophagic flux
Recent studies found that autophagic flux is
involved in the activation of apoptotic signaling factors
such as cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-8 in
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis [18, 45, 46]. Therefore,
we evaluated expression of autophagic flux markers
including LC3 and p62 proteins by western blot analysis
and immunofluorescence staining (Figure 3). Western
blot analysis showed that the expression of p62 protein
decreased and that of LC3-II protein increased after niacin
treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). During
the autophagy process, microtubule-associated light chain
3 (LC3-I) is converted into the autophagosomal membrane
form of LC3-II, which is the most reliable marker for
autophagy activation [47]. p62 protein facilitates the
degradation of polyubiquitinated protein or organelles,
causing its own degradation; therefore, a decreased
level of p62 protein indicates activation of autophagy
and autophagic degradation [40]. Our western blot data

of niacin sensitized HCT116 cells to TRAIL-induced cell
death compared to niacin alone (Figure 4A–4C). And
also, chloroquine increased TRAIL induced apoptosis and
chloroquine alone was not affected cell viability (Figure
4A–4C). The activated form of caspase-3, which is known
to be a pro-apoptotic factor, was increased by chloroquine
in co-treatment with niacin and TRAIL. Furthermore,
death-receptor5 protein increased by chloroquine treatment
(Figure 4D). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that
chloroquine treatment increased production of the active
form of caspase-3(Figure 4E). These data indicated that
inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine increased TRAILrelated proapoptotic signaling in HCT116 cells.

treatment with niacin and chloroquine, a known autophagy
inhibitor, on TRAIL treatment. HCT116 cells were
pretreated with 50 nM chloroquine for 6 h and exposed

showed that ATG5 siRNA inhibited the effect of niacin
treatment on TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Figure 6A).
We further studied the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to
TRAIL-induced cell death using crystal violet and LDH
assays (Figure 6B–6C), and showed that ATG5 siRNA
down-regulated cell viability and increased LDH levels
(Figure 6B–6C). Functional knockdown of siRNA
was confirmed by western blot data showing downregulation of ATG5 protein by ATG5 siRNA (Figure
6D). Next, we investigated whether ATG5 siRNA affects
the expression of proapoptotic factors such as caspase-8
and caspase-3 protein using western blot analysis.
Expression of ATG siRNA in HCT116 cells increased
the induction of cleaved caspase-8 and cleaved
caspase-3 upon treatment with niacin and TRAIL,
and increased the expression of autophagy markers
including p62 and LC3 (Figure 6E). Furthermore,
ATG5 siRNA increased death receptor4 and 5 compared
to niacin treatment (Figure 6F). These results showed
that genetic inhibition of autophagy by ATG5 siRNA
enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis and inhibited
autophagic flux in HCT116 cells.

Genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes
TRAIL-induced cell death upon niacin treatment
To verify that niacin-induced autophagy plays
a protective role against TRAIL-induced apoptosis,
we used a genetic approach (ATG5 siRNA) to
study the effect of autophagy inhibition on TRAILinduced apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Atg5 is necessary
for autophagy because it’s role in autophagosome
elongation [47]. The cells were pretreated with 20 nM
ATG5 siRNA for 24 h and then treated with 800 μM

factor in cancer cells [48] (Figure 7C–7D). The intrinsic
apoptotic pathway is characterized by mitochondrial
permeabilization and involves activation of proapoptotic
proteins including BCL-2 and Bax [49]. Western blot
analysis data showed that niacin increased levels of BCL2 and decreased levels of Bax (Figure 7C). These data
indicated that niacin has a potential role in protecting
against intrinsic apoptosis signaling and increasing
survival.

Recent studies showed that niacin affects
mitochondrial complex 1 activity and enhances the
NAD+/NADH ratio [5]. Furthermore, niacin treatment
promotes activation of the PI3/Akt cascade in human
epithelial carcinoma cells [6]. Therefore, we examined
the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and expression
of p-Akt and mitochondria-related apoptotic factors
including BCL-2 and Bax. Cells were pretreated with the
indicated doses of niacin for 12 h and protein levels of
BCL-2, Bax, and p-Akt were examined by western blot
analysis. We examined mitochondrial dysfunction using
JC-1 and the data exhibited that niacin decreased TRAILinduced mitochondrial dysfunction but chloroquine
increased mitochondrial dysfunction upon niacin
treatment (Figure 7A–7B). Next, Our western blot data

DISCUSSION
The goal of this study was to investigate the effect
of niacin on TRAIL treatment in TRAIL-sensitive cells.
Our study suggests that niacin induces autophagic flux
in TRAIL-induced apoptosis through down-regulation of
death receptors proteins DR4 and DR5 and prevention of
mitochondria membrane depolarization.
Some studies have suggested that niacin treatment
activates AKT protein, a cell survival factor in human
epithelial carcinoma cell lines, and inhibits metastatic

activity by enhancing the NAD+/NADH ratio in cultured
MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 human breast
carcinoma cells [5, 6]. As a potential therapeutic drug,
TRAIL induces apoptotic programed cell death in various
cancer cells, and HCT116 colon cancer cells are known to
be sensitive to TRAIL [50].
However, until now the relationship between niacin
and TRAIL has not been studied in any cancer cells. Our
results showed that TRAIL treatment induced apoptosis
in HCT116 cells, and that niacin treatment inhibited
TRAIL-induced apoptosis and decreased expression of the
proapoptotic factors caspase-8 and caspase-3 (Figure 1).
Niacin is known to affect the activation of mitochondrial
complex 1 and increase the NAD+/NADH ratio in breast
cancer cells; therefore, we examined the effect of niacin
on mitochondria membrane potential in HCT cells. Niacin
treatment increased the expression of Bcl-2 protein, a
known anti-apoptotic factor, and decreased the expression
of decreased Bax, a known proapoptotic factor (Figure 7A).
Niacin also inhibited the induction by TRAIL of the JC-1
monomer forms, a marker of cell apoptosis (Figure 7D).
Furthermore, niacin down-regulated death receptor proteins
including DR4 and DR5 that are related to TRAIL in the
HCT116 TRAIL-sensitive cell line (Figure 3).
Recent studies have shown that TRAIL induces
autophagic flux in TRAIL-resistant cells and inhibits
autophagic flux in TRAIL-sensitive cells [41]. Niacin
decreases expression of the autophagy marker p62 in
breast cancer cells [5] but the relationship between niacin
and autophagy is unclear in a variety of cancer cells,
including HCT116 TRAIL-sensitive cells. We observed
that niacin markedly decreased the level of p62 protein
and increased that of LC3-II, indicating autophagy
induction (Figure 3). To confirm that niacin inhibited
TRAIL-mediated cell death via autophagic flux, we
showed that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of
autophagy promoted TRAIL-induced cell death compared
to niacin alone using chloroquine as a lysosomal inhibitor
and siRNA specific for the autophagosomal factor ATG5
(Figure 5 and Figure 6). Moreover, combined niacin and
chloroquine treatment inhibited JC-1 aggregation as a
survival marker and induced the JC-1 monomer form as
an apoptosis marker (Figure 7B).
Niacin (also known as vitamin B3 or nicotinic
acid) is known to be present in black beans and other
common foods, and has been shown inhibit metastasis
of breast cancer cells by modulation of NAD+ levels
[5, 51]. However, the relationship between niacin
and apoptosis induced by anticancer reagents such as
TRAIL protein has not been studied in cancer cells. We
found that niacin treatment inhibited TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis and induced autophagy flux in HCT116
human colon cancer cells. We examined that both niacin
treatment and niacin combined with chloroquine were
not affected death receptors of mRNA levels (data not

shown). These result indicated that autophagy induced
by niacin treatment influence on death receptor of protein
levels. Furthermore, autophagic pathway is associated
with lysosomal degradation of protein. Therefore,
niacin mediated autophagic flux effects death receptors
of protein expression. Inhibition of autophagic flux by
chloroquine and ATG5 siRNA decreased the protective
effect of niacin. These results demonstrate that niacin
inhibits TRAIL-induced cell death through regulation
of autophagic flux in TRAIL-sensitive HCT116 cells,
suggesting that niacin treatment might have adverse
effects on anticancer agents that function through the
induction of autophagy flux. So, TRAIL treatment has to
combine with autophagy inhibitor such as chloroquine in
human cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116
was maintained in RPMI1640 medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen-Gibco, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin in a
humidified incubator maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2.

Protein isolation and western blotting
Proteins were resolved by 10–15% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed
by western blotting as described previously [42]. The
antibodies used for immunoblotting were specific for
Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA); phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt), cleaved caspase-3,
caspase-8, p62 and LC3(Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA); DR4, DR5 and β-actin (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).

Crystal violet assay
Whole cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells/well in a
12-well plate and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The cells
were pretreated with chloroquine for 6 h and niacin for
12 h and further incubated with recombinant TRAIL for
an additional 2 h. Cell morphology was examined using
an inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan) and cell viability
was determined by the crystal violet staining method as
previously described [43]. Briefly, cells were stained for
10 min at room temperature with a staining solution (0.5%
crystal violet in 30% ethanol and 3% formaldehyde),
washed four times with water, and dried. Cells were then
lysed with 1% SDS solution and absorbance was measured
at 550 nm. Cell viability was calculated from the relative
dye intensity and compared to the controls.
