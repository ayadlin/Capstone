ABSTRACT
Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is frequently observed in
patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and is considered a major determinant of
CRC pathogenesis. CRC pathogenesis is particularly accompanied by epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) and survivin expression. Here, we investigated
the potential and mechanism of a novel Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor IWR-1 to
suppress tumor metastasis in relation with EMT and survivin expression.
We first determined the EMT reversal effects of IWR-1 in in vitro (HCT116
and HT29 cells) and ex vivo (specimens of CRC patients) CRC models. It was
shown that IWR-1 inhibited cell proliferation and EMT even in the presence of
TNF-α-induced cancer cell stimulation. IWR-1 also significantly suppressed
cell migration, invasion, and matrix metalloproteinase activities of CRC cell
lines. Furthermore, we showed the evidence that IWR-1 provides EMT reversal
effects by directly suppressing survivin expression by the followings: 1)
IWR-1 could not completely inhibit EMT in survivin-overexpressing HCT116 cells, 2)
EMT reversal effects of IWR-1 were more pronounced in survivin-suppressed cells,
and 3) Survivin promoter assay directly identified the survivin promoter region
responsible for inhibition of survivin transcription by IWR-1. Taken altogether, our
results demonstrate that IWR-1 has the potential to suppress tumor metastasis by
inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway as well as survivin expression. Therefore, IWR1 could be considered for future clinical use as a therapeutic agent to treat CRC.

enters the nucleus where it orchestrates the transcription of
several target genes responsible for cell proliferation [4].
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is the one of the key
elements inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) [5, 6]. During EMT, epithelial cells acquire the
characteristics of mesenchymal cells, such as lack of
polarization, increased motility and invasiveness, decreased
cell-cell junctions, and chemotherapeutic resistance [7, 8].
Thus, EMT is known to be essential for the initial and
overall rate-limiting steps of CRC invasion and metastasis
[7]. Furthermore, EMT is also considered a major
determinant of CRC prognosis because the deep invasion
and distal metastasis considerably worsen the prognosis of
CRCs [9]. In recent years, as the emphasis of EMT in the
tumor progression has been increased, anticancer strategies
against EMT have been widely investigated [10–12].

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is diagnosed in more than
1 million people worldwide each year, and is responsible
for the death of approximately half of these patients,
making it the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the
world [1]. Wnt/ β-catenin pathway serves critical functions
in CRC oncogenesis, especially for inducing proliferation
and differentiation in 90% CRCs [2, 3]. Without Wnt
stimulation, β-catenin is incorporated in the β-catenin
destruction complex with APC, Axin, and glycogen
synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and is to be phosphorylated
and processed to undergo proteasomal degradation.
However, when Wnt ligands bind Frizzled receptors,
Disheveled proteins are activated, and then β-catenin
degradation is blocked. Subsequently, excess β-catenin

IWR-1 effects in the TNF-α-induced EMT in
HCT116 cells

Survivin (BIRC5), a member of the inhibitor of
apoptosis (IAP) protein family, is a representative antiapoptotic protein which promotes tumor cell growth
[13]. Survivin is abundantly expressed during fetal
development in humans, but is rarely present in adult
tissues [14]; however, most human cancer cells express
survivin, including CRC cells which were reported to
express survivin up to 68% [15]. It has been reported
that survivin expression correlates with advanced
disease, poorer survival, and chemotherapy and radiation
resistance [14, 16–18]. Therefore, survivin is of increasing
interest as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit cancer
growth [19, 20].
Evidence has shown that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
one of the key factors inducing survivin expression
[14, 21, 22]. Despite the significance of the Wnt/βcatenin pathway in CRC, anticancer agents targeting
Wnt/β-catenin signaling have not been extensively
investigated. IWR-1 was first identified in 2009 as one
of the inhibitors of Wnt response (IWR) [23]. It has
been shown that IWR-1 promotes β-catenin destruction
in the β-catenin destruction complex by abrogating
Axin protein turnover and thereby inducing β-catenin
phosphorylation, a prerequisite for proteasome-mediated
β-catenin degradation [23]. However, the roles of IWR-1
in the CRC pathogenesis, especially in relation with EMT,
are still not fully understood and thus need to be clarified.
The aim of our work was to elucidate the role of IWR-1
in CRC dissemination, especially in relation with EMT
and survivin expression and to provide insights into the
potential and mechanism of IWR-1 to suppress CRC
invasion and metastasis.

It has been shown that TNF-α induces EMT in
human HCT116 cells and thereby promotes CRC invasion
and metastasis [24]. We were intended to investigate the
EMT-suppressive effect of IWR-1 in the presence of EMT
overstimulation. We thus analyzed the expression of the EMT
markers and Wnt component β-catenin in HCT116 cells after
stimulation with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 24 h. As expected,
TNF-α stimulation increased β-catenin expression, and
induced EMT-like expressional changes, such as increased
N-cadherin and Snail and decreased E-cadherin expressions
(Figure 2A). IWR-1, however, decreased β-catenin
expression, and inhibited the EMT-like expressional changes
whereby decreasing N-cadherin and Snail and increasing
E-cadherin expressions, even in the presence of TNFα-induced EMT stimulation (Figure  2B). Subsequently,
RT-qPCR demonstrated IWR-1 effect of inhibiting
EMT(increasing E-cadherin and decreasing Snail) in the
mRNA levels under the TNF-α-induced EMT stimulation
(Figure 2C). These observations were substantiated by
immunofluorescence microscopy, which also showed the
increase of E-cadherin and decrease of Vimentin and Snail
after the treatment of IWR-1, even in the presence of TNF-αinduced EMT stimulation (Figure 2D). Similar results were
obtained from the HT29 cell line (see the Supplementary
Figure S2A–S2D). We also have shown that IWR-1 equally
inhibits EMT of the colon carcinoma cell lines with (HT29,
SW480, and SW620 cells) or without (HCT116 cells) APC
mutation (see the Supplementary Figure S3).

IWR-1 effects on HCT116 cell migration and
invasion

RESULTS

To determine the IWR-1 effects on CRC invasion,
we conducted the Transwell invasion assay. Although
TNF-α enhanced the invasiveness of HCT116 cells,
IWR-1 significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced cell invasion
(P < 0.05) (Figure 2E). Subsequently, to determine IWR-1
effects on CRC migration, we conducted the wound healing
assay. Similar to cell invasion, although TNF-α enhanced
HCT116 cell migration, IWR-1 significantly inhibited
TNF-α-stimulated migration (P < 0.05) (Figure  2F).
Similar results were obtained from the HT29 cell line (see
the Supplementary Figure S4A–S4B). Taken together, we
clearly demonstrated that IWR-1 significantly inhibited
HCT116 and HT29 cell invasion and migration, even in the
presence of TNF-α-induced cancer cell stimulation.
To further investigate the role of IWR-1 in CRC
invasion, we measured matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
activities. MMPs, mostly MMP2 and MMP9, are known
to facilitate cancer cell invasion by degrading extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins, and are thus increased during EMT
[25, 26]. We determined MMP2 and MMP9 activities
in HCT116 cells by gelatin zymography followed by

IWR-1 effects on the HCT116 cell proliferation
and EMT
Human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells were treated
with increasing concentrations (5–50 μM) of IWR-1
(structure is shown in Figure 1A) for 24 h or 48 h and
analyzed for cell proliferation. The results indicate that
IWR-1 decreased the proliferation of HCT116 cells in a
dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 1B).
The epithelial marker E-cadherin and the mesen­
chymal markers N-cadherin, Snail, and Vimentin are
specifically used to monitor the EMT process. Expression
analysis of these markers in IWR-1-treated HCT116 cells
by western blotting revealed that IWR-1 dose- and timedependently increased the levels of the epithelial marker
E-cadherin, whereas it decreased the mesenchymal
markers N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail (Figure 1C–1D).
Collectively, our results indicate that IWR-1 effectively
inhibited the EMT process in HCT116 cells. Similar
results were obtained from the HT29 cell line (see the
Supplementary Figure S1A–S1B).

densitometry analysis. It was shown that although TNF-α
increased gelatin degradation by MMP2 and MMP9 in
HCT116 cell supernatants, IWR-1significantly reduced
the MMP2 and MMP9 activities in the cancer cells, even
in the presence of TNF-α-induced cancer cell stimulation
(Figure 2G).

To determine the precise effect of IWR-1 according
to the Akt activity, we measured the EMT-suppressing
effect of IWR-1 after Akt overexpression or suppression.
Akt overexpression and suppression were made by the
transfection with pcDNA3.1Myr-Akt and by the treatment
with 20 μM PI3K inhibitor LY294002, respectively.
It was appeared that Akt effectively suppressed EMT
processes regardless of whether Akt was overexpressed
or suppressed (Figure 3C, 3D). These results suggest that
IWR-1 does not directly affect Akt in suppressing EMT.

IWR-1 effects according to the Akt expression
status
Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling has been reported
in 60–70% of human CRCs and PI3K/Akt inhibitors have
been suggested as potential therapeutic agents [27]. We,
therefore, investigated the involvement of Akt activation
in IWR-1 inhibition of EMT in human CRC cells. It was
shown that IWR-1 effectively inhibited Akt expression in
a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 3A, 3B).

IWR-1 effects on the survivin expression
Next, we investigated IWR-1 effects on survivin.
Survivin is known as one of the Wnt target gene [28]
and a downstream of PI3K/Akt signaling as well [29].
Survivin, therefore, promotes tumor proliferation directly

The results show that IWR-1 effectively decreased
survivin expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Figure 4A–4B), suggesting possible effect of IWR-1 on
the survivin.
We further investigated the effects of IWR-1 on
EMT of HCT116 cells in which survivin expressions
had been increased and decreased, respectively. Survivin
overexpression was induced by transfecting HCT116
cells with pcDNA-survivin. The control group was
transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 vector. Interestingly,
IWR-1 could not effectively inhibit EMT in survivinoverexpressing HCT116 cells (Figure 4C). Next, survivin
suppression was made by the treatment with si-RNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

targeting survivin (si-Survivin). The control group
was treated with scrambled siRNA (si-Control). EMTsuppressing effects of IWR-1 was more pronounced in
survivin-suppressed HCT116 cells than in the control
HCT116 cells (Figure 4D). Taken together, our results are
consistent with the supposition that IWR-1 inhibits EMT
by decreasing survivin expression.
Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of IWR-1 on
MMP activities according to survivin expression status.
In survivin-overexpressing cells (pcDNA-Survivin),
IWR-1 could not effectively reduce gelatinase activities
of MMP2 and MMP9 (Figure 4E). By contrast, IWR-1
could significantly reduce MMP activities when survivin
was suppressed (si-Survivin) (P < 0.05) (Figure 4F).

Demonstration of IWR-1 effects in CRC tissues
We then performed comparative western blotting
analysis of paired surgical specimens (CRC tissues and
non-cancerous colorectal tissues from the same patients)
obtained from 13 patients that underwent treatment in
our institution. The median patient age was 71 years
(55–83). The median tumor size was 5.0 cm (1.5–12.0),
and the lesions were distributed in the cecum (n = 1),
descending colon (n = 1), sigmoid colon (n = 8), and
rectum (n = 3). Histopathology of CRC tissues revealed
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (n = 11) and
poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (n = 2). The patients
showed stage I (n = 2), stage II (n = 3), and stage III
(n = 8) CRCs.
Western blot analysis showed that CRC specimens
exhibited the increased survivin expression and EMTlike expressional changes (decreased E-cadherin and
increased N-cadherin and Snail expressions) compared
to the matched controls (Figure 6A). Subsequently,
immunohistochemical analysis showed the increase of
β-catenin, survivin, and Snail and decrease of E-cadherin
in CRC tissues (Figure 6B).
The effects of IWR-1 on the expression of EMT
markers and survivin were further investigated in the

Because we have shown that IWR-1 inhibits
EMT by decreasing survivin expression, we conducted
luciferase reporter assay to investigate whether
IWR-1 could decrease survivin transcriptional activity.
The control was the pGL3-Basic-transfected cells. The
luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that the activity of
the survivin promoter was dose-dependently decreased by
IWR-1 treatment (Figure 5A).
We then attempted to identify survivin promoter
region responsible for inhibition of survivin transcription
by IWR-1 (Figure 5B, 5C). Series of survivin promoterluciferase deletion constructs (–990/–479, –990/–694,
–469/–11, and –189/–11) were generated from pLuc979 using HindIII, HincII, SmaI, MluI, ApaLI restriction
enzymes. HCT116 cells were then transfected with various
survivin promoter–luciferase constructs and treated with
or without IWR-1 (10 μM) for 24 h after transfection,
followed by luciferase activity assays. A 979-bp survivin
promoter region from −990 to −11 was identified as
playing a major role in IWR-1-mediated inhibition of
survivin promoter activity. Next, we narrowed the minimal
responsive region in the survivin promoter using a set of

compared using western blot analysis. IWR-1 significantly

decreased the protein expressions of β-catenin and
survivin, and inhibited EMT of CRC tissues, even in the
presence of TNF-α-induced EMT stimulation (Figure 6C).

protein survivin. Survivin promotes tumor proliferation
by way of modulating multiple critical cell signaling
pathways. Therefore, IWR-1 is expected to provide
more powerful potential to suppress tumor invasion and
metastasis, representing as a promising strategy for future
CRC treatment.
In this study, we have shown that IWR-1 significantly
inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by decreasing
survivin expression. Akt, initially described as an oncogene
[31, 32], serves a variety of functions, including cell
survival, proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and EMT
[33]. A number of studies have indicated that Akt
activation in human cancer is a major determinant of
aggressive clinical behavior [34–41]. We have found
that IWR-1 inhibited Akt expression in a dose- and timedependent manner. However, interestingly, when Akt was
overexpressed by the transfection with pcDNA3.1MyrAkt, IWR-1 still exerted the EMT reversal potential.
Therefore, it can be postulated that IWR-1 acts on the
downstream molecule of Akt signaling in favor of EMT
rather than directly acting on the Akt itself. Survivin is a
downstream molecule of Akt signaling in favor of EMT
[42–44]. In this study, we showed the evidence that IWR1 provides EMT reversal effects by directly suppressing
survivin expression by the followings: 1) IWR-1 could
not completely inhibit EMT in survivin-overexpressing
HCT116 cells, 2) EMT reversal effects of IWR-1 were

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that IWR-1, an
inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, has the potential
to suppress tumor invasion and metastasis in both in vitro
(HCT116 and HT29 cells) and ex vivo (CRC patientderived tissues) CRC models: IWR-1 showed clear and
consistent inhibition of CRC cell proliferation, invasion,
migration, EMT process, and MMP activities. These
potentials to suppress CRC invasion and metastasis were
evident even after TNF-α-induced EMT stimulation. The
anticancer effect of IWR-1 has been attributed to the
enhancement of β-catenin destruction by way of blocking
Axin protein turnover. In addition to this, we have found
that IWR-1 reduces the expression of an anti-apoptotic

more pronounced in survivin-suppressed cells than in the
controls, and 3) Survivin promoter assay directly identified
the survivin promoter region responsible for inhibition of
survivin transcription by IWR-1. Taken altogether, it could
be concluded that IWR-1 inhibits EMT of CRC cells by
way of decreasing survivin (its downstream substance)
expression.
In this study, we also found that IWR-1 also
consistently reduced MMP activities of CRC cell lines.
The degradation of the ECM by proteolytic enzymes is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a prerequisite to invasion and metastasis in EMT [45],
and the principal ECM-degrading enzymes are MMP2
and MMP9. Metastatic cancer cells actively synthesize
MMPs, the higher levels of which reflect enhanced tumor
metastatic capacity [25, 46, 47]. We have shown that IWR-1
significantly reduces the MMP2 and MMP9 activities in
the cancer cells, even in the presence of TNF-α-induced
cancer cell stimulation. Furthermore, we have found that 1)
IWR-1 does not completely reduce MMP activities in
survivin-overexpressing HCT116 cells, and 2) IWR-1

reduces MMP activities especially when survivin
expression is suppressed. Collectively, these findings
suggest that IWR-1 reduces MMP activities by decreasing
survivin expression.
Survivin is preferentially and highly expressed in
cancer cells, and promotes tumor proliferation. Several
mechanisms by which survivin promotes tumor progression
have been proposed. First, survivin confers resistance to
apoptosis by directly suppressing caspase-3 activity [48].
In this signaling pathway, survivin binds to and inhibits
caspase-3 through the phosphorylation of Thr34 by the p34
(cdc2) kinase [49]. Second, survivin controls chromosome
spindle-checkpoint assembly, thereby ensuring normal cell
division [50]. It was evidenced by its maximal expression
during G2/M checkpoint of the cell cycle [51–53]. Finally,
survivin serves a critical function in tumor angiogenesis
as it is strongly expressed in endothelial cells during the
proliferative phase of angiogenesis [54–56]. Therefore,
survivin is highly expressed in patients with an increased
risk of tumor progression and chemoresistance in various
tumors [57–59].
Besides, several reports indicate that survivin favors
EMT based on the observation of increased survivin
expression during EMT [13, 60–62]. However, it has not
thoroughly investigated whether and how much survivin

is associated with the EMT process of CRC cells. Herein,
we clearly showed that survivin is increased during the
EMT process in both in vitro and ex vivo CRC models. To
determine the role of survivin in EMT with certainty, we
designed HCT116 cells which have been manipulated to
overexpress or suppress survivin, respectively. Whereas
survivin-overexpressing HCT116 cells increased EMT,
survivin-suppressed cells did not increase EMT. These
results strongly suggest that overexpressed survivin has a
detrimental effect on CRC prognosis by promoting EMT,
and therefore, controlling survivin would be one of the
possible strategies to prevent CRC progression.
Based on these results, we propose a mechanism by
which IWR-1 elicits its EMT reversal effect of CRC cells
(Figure 7A, 7B). We herein focused on the two pathways,
Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt, of which activations
have been shown to promote EMT. As reported, IWR-1
increases β-catenin destruction by way of blocking Axin
protein turnover, thereby resulting in exerting its EMT
reversal abilities. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is one of the
key signaling pathways triggering EMT, and survivin is
a known downstream target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
[21, 22]. Therefore, IWR-1, as a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor,
seems to decrease survivin in the process of inhibiting
EMT. Of note, survivin is also one of the downstream

complex. In this study, we have shown that IWR-1 can also inhibit EMT progression of CRC cells by directly suppressing survivin expression.

substances of PI3K/Akt signaling [19, 63]. In this study,
we have shown the evidence that IWR-1 inhibits EMT
process by way of directly decreasing survivin expression.
Because survivin is the downstream substance of both
Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways targeting
EMT, IWR-1 is expected to have higher EMT reversal
abilities.
In summary, we have shown that survivin serves
critical functions as a downstream substance of both Wnt/
β-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways triggering
EMT. IWR-1, as a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor, exhibited
strong potentials to suppress CRC cell invasion and
metastasis, especially in terms of suppressing migration,
invasion, EMT, and MMP activities of CRC cells. Besides
inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, IWR-1
was demonstrated to inhibit EMT by way of decreasing
survivin expression. This work thus lays the foundation
for a novel, IWR-1-based therapeutic approach to prevent
CRC progression. Clinical studies are required to identify
patient populations that will greatly benefit from IWR-1
therapy.

× 104 cells/well overnight and then treated with different
concentrations of IWR-1 (5, 10, 25, and 50 μM) for 24 h
or 48 h, respectively. Next, the reagent from the EZ-Cytox
kit was added to each well for 30 min; the plates were
then placed on a shaker for 30 s and the absorbance was
measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (model 680;
Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed using the EzRIPA Lysis kit (ATTO
Corporation; Tokyo, Japan), and quantified by Bradford
reagent (Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized by western
analysis using the following primary antibodies (1:1000
dilution) at 4°C overnight and then with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at 25°C.
Specific immune complexes were detected using the
Western Blotting Plus Chemiluminescence Reagent
(Millipore; Bedford, MA).

METHODS

Real-time quantitative PCR

Chemicals and reagents

Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Reverse transcription was performed
with 1 μg RNA using RT-Premix kit (ELPIS Biotech,
Daejeon, South Korea) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The primers used for SYBR Green real-time
quantitative (q) PCR were as follows: E-cadherin forward
5′-TACACTGCCCAGGAGCCAGA-3′ and reverse
5′-GGCACCAGTGTCCGGATTA-3′; Snail, forward
5′- GACCACTATGCCGCGCTCTT-3′ and reverse
5′-TCGCTGTAGTTAGGCTTCCGATT-3′;
GAPDH,
forward 5′- GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC-3′ and
reverse 5′-TGGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGA-3′ [24]. The
reaction was performed using an Applied Biosystems®
7500 96-Well Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). After normalization to the GAPDH
gene, the expression levels for each target gene were
calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method.
The data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation
(SD) from three independent experiments.

IWR-1 was obtained from ENZO (Farmingdale,
NY, USA), PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA), and recombinant
human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was from R&D
Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies
against E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, Survivin,
Vimentin, p-Akt (Ser473), t-Akt, β-catenin, and β-Actin
as well as secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (HRP), Alexa-594, and FITC were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).
Lipofectamine 2000, SYBR Green, and the total RNA
purification kit were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
CA, USA), and the RT-Premix Kit was obtained from
ELPIS Biotech (Daejeon, South Korea).

Cell culture
We obtained four colorectal carcinoma cells,
HCT116, HT29, SW480, and SW620 from KCLB
(Korean cell line bank). They were maintained in RPMI
medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
1% penicillin-streptomycin (GibcoBRL, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in a humidified
incubator.

Migration and invasion assays
HCT116 and HT29 cell migration was analyzed
using the in vitro wound healing assay. Cells were grown
to confluence in 48-well plates and changed to serum-free
medium for additional 24 h. Cell monolayers were scraped
with a micropipette tip and treated with 10 uM IWR-1.
The wound area was photographed under phase-contrast
microscopy before and 24 h after the treatment and the
percentage of wound closure was determined as: [(initial
area - final area)/initial area] × 100 [64].

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was evaluated by the water
soluble tetrazolium (WST-1) assay using the EZ-Cytox

Overexpression and silencing of the Akt and
survivin genes

Invasion assays were conducted using the
CytoSelect 24-Well Cell Invasion Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs,
San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, 300 μL of HCT116 and
HT29 cells (1 × 105cells/ml) in serum-free medium was
plated into the CytoSelect basement membrane chamber,
respectively, and 500 μL of 10% FBS-containing RPMI
was added to the lower well of the invasion plate;
both upper and lower chambers contained the 10 uM
IWR-1. The chambers were then incubated for 48 h at
37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, non-migratory cells were
removed, and migrated cells were stained, dissociated
from the membrane, and their absorbance was measured at
560 nm using the microplate reader (model 680; Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA) [65].

Human survivin cDNA and Akt cDNA were obtained
by RT-PCR using HCT116 and HT29 cell RNA and
primers based on GenBank sequences (accession numbers
U75285 [48] and NM-001014431.1, [66] respectively).
PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI (Takara
Tokyo, Japan), and ligated into the pcDNA3.1-myc vector
(Invitrogen). Transcription was specifically suppressed by
the introduction of the 21-nucleotide duplex siRNA, which
targeted survivin mRNA coding sequence. Briefly, HCT116
cells were plated in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and
transiently transfected with 100 nM per well of survivin
siRNA (Santa Cruz) mixed with the DharmaFECT siRNA
transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Silencer Negative
Control siRNA (Santa Cruz) was used as a negative control
and introduced into the cells under the same protocol. After
5-h incubation, the medium was changed to complete
culture medium, and the cells were incubated at 37°C in a
CO2 incubator for 48 h before harvesting.

Immunofluorescence
HCT116 and HT29 cells were cultured on LabTek chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized with
0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking with 0.2%
bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature,
the slides were incubated with the antibodies against
E-cadherin, Vimentin, or Snail (1:100 dilution) at 4°C
overnight. The slides were washed three times with PBS
and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor
594-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution)
for 1 h at room temperature; the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI-containing VECTASHIELD Mounting
Medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) for
1 min. The samples were then examined under a Laser
Scanning Microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) to analyze
the expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail.

Collection and culture of colorectal cancer tissue
Human colorectal tissue specimens (paired normal
and cancer tissues from each patient, n = 13) were
obtained after surgical resections performed at the Daejeon
St. Mary’s hospital, the Catholic University of Korea.
The ethics committee at our institution approved the use
of the tissue specimens for research. The tissue samples
(diameter, 3 – 4 mm) were washed three times, dissected
in cold PBS (Invitrogen) containing 2× penicillin/
streptomycin mixture (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and
cultured in 24-well culture plates with serum-free DMEM/
F12 containing 2× penicillin/streptomycin and 10 μM
IWR-1 to establish an ex vivo human cancer organ model.
The plates were then placed in a humidified incubator and
maintained for 24 h in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Thereafter, the tissue samples were collected for western
blot and fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution and
embedded in paraffin for histology, respectively.

Gelatin zymography analysis of secreted matrix
metalloproteinases
Cell culture supernatants were collected,
centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min, and mixed with
3× sample buffer (62 mM Tris-HCL, pH 6.8; 2%
SDS; 10% glycerol; and 0.05% bromophenol blue).
Zymography was performed using 10% polyacrylamide
gels impregnated with 0.2% gelatin. Following
electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice at room
temperature for 30 min in 2.5% Triton X-100, then in
buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl,
5 mM CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5, and incubated in
this buffer at 37°C for 24 h. Then, the gels were stained
with 0.5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 (BioRad) for 1 h and destained in methanol-acetic acid-water
(5:1:5 molar ratio). Gelatinolytic activity was identified
by clear bands appearing on the blue-stained background.
The gels were scanned, and the images were processed
by extracting the blue channel signal, converting it to
black and white, and inverting it to quantify gelatinolytic
activity based on integrated optical density.

Construction of the plasmid containing survivin
promoter
Genomic DNA was extracted from HCT116
cells using the DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA). Survivin promoter site (979 bp) in the 5′
flanking region of the survivin gene was amplified
by PCR using the following primers: forward primer,
5′-CTGGCCATAGAACCAGAGAAGTGA-3′ and reverse
primer, 5′-CCACCTCTGCCAACGGGTCCCGCG-3′.
Subsequently, the promoter region was excised using SacI
and HindIII, and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector
(Promega) cut with the above enzymes to generate the
pGL3-survivin plasmid. Thereafter, to identify survivin
