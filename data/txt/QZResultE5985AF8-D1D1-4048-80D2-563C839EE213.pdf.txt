BACKGROUND: The active metabolite of vitamin D 1a,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25D3) has exhibited broad-spectrum antitumor
activity in xenograft animal models. However, its activity against metastatic disease has not been extensively investigated. METHODS:
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or 1,25D3-resistant variant SCC-DR cells were treated with 1,25D3. Actin organization was examined
by immunofluorescence assay. Cell migration was assessed by ‘‘wound’’ healing and chemotactic migration assays. Cell invasion was
assessed by a Matrigel-based invasion assay and in situ zymography. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 expression and
secretion were examined by immunoblot analysis and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. E-cadherin expression
was assessed by flow cytometry, immunoblot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Knockdown of E-cadherin was achieved by small
interfering RNA. An experimental metastasis mouse model was created by intravenous injection of tumor cells; and lung tumor development in the mice was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, gross observation, and histology. RESULTS: SCC cellular morphology and actin organization were altered by 10 nM 1,25D3. 1,25D3 inhibited SCC cell motility and invasion, which were associated with
reduced expression and secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and 1,25D3 promoted the expression of E-cadherin. These findings were not
observed in SCC-DR cells. Knock down of E-cadherin rescued 1,25D3-inhibited cell migration. Intravenous injection of SCC or SCC-DR
cells resulted in the establishment of extensive pulmonary lesions in saline-treated C3H mice. Treatment with 1,25D3 resulted in a
marked reduction in the formation of lung tumor colonies in mice that were injected with SCC cells, but not in mice that were injected
with SCC-DR cells. CONCLUSIONS: 1,25D3 suppressed SCC cell motility, invasion, and metastasis, partially through the promotion of

INTRODUCTION
Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone that regulates calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization as well as several other
physiologic activities.1 1a,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D3), the active metabolite of vitamin D, has demonstrated broad
spectrum antitumor activities in numerous preclinical studies.2-7 1,25D3 exerts growth-inhibitory effects by a variety of
mechanisms, including the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation in cancer cells. We previously demonstrated that 1,25D3 inhibits the growth of murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell line SCCVII/SF in vitro and in
vivo.5,8,9 Apoptosis contributes to this growth inhibition, because 1,25D3 induces caspase 3 activation and poly(adenosine
diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in SCC cells.9 In addition, we have demonstrated that 1,25D3 enhances
paclitaxel, gemcitabine, cisplatin, and carboplatin-mediated antitumor activities.10-12 However, the activity of 1,25D3
against SCC metastasis has not been extensively studied.
Metastasis is a complex process that involves a series of steps, including the initial detachment of cells from the primary tumor; local invasion of the basement membrane; intravasation and survival in the circulation; extravasation, invasion, and survival; and proliferation in a distant site.13 Failure of any single step will lead to the suppression of systemic
metastasis formation. 1,25D3 or its analogs may affect these crucial steps. Sung and Feldman demonstrated that 1,25D3
inhibits prostate cancer cell migration and adhesion by down-regulation of integrins.14 Bao et al reported that 1,25D3
inhibits prostate cancer cell invasion by suppressing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and cathepsins.15 However, the mechanisms for the regulation of cell motility and invasion remain unclear. Conversely, vitamin D
deficiency promotes cancer cell growth in several metastasis models. In diet-induced, vitamin D-deficient mice, the
growth of human breast cancer cells, injected into the tibia of mice, was enhanced; and larger osteolytic lesions were
observed compared with the lesions observed in vitamin D-sufficient mice.16,17 Similarly, prostate cancer cell growth in

bone was enhanced in vitamin D-deficient mice.18 These
observations suggest that 1,25D3 may play a role in tumor
metastasis by multiple regulatory pathways and prompted
our current investigation.
In the current study, we investigated the role of
1,25D3 in the modulation of the morphology and behavior of SCC cells and cells from 1,25D3-resistant SCC variant (SCC-DR cells). The effect of 1,25D3 on cell motility
and invasion was evaluated. We studied the role of E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell adhesion in the regulation of
SCC cell motility by 1,25D3. Furthermore, the in vivo activity of 1,25D3 in suppressing lung colony formation after intravenous injection was evaluated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials

1,25D3 (Hoffmann-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ) was reconstituted in 100% ethanol (ETOH) and stored, protected
from light, under nitrogen gas at 70 C. Anti-MMP-2
and anti-MMP-9 were purchased from Biomol (Farmingdale, NY). Anti-E-cadherin was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, Mass). Anti-actin was
purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, Calif).
Cell Culture and Tumor Model System

A murine SCC cell (SCCVII-SF) tumor model and SCC
cells were used as described previously.19 1,25D3-resistant
SCC-DR cells were generated by continuously culturing
SCC cells in media containing 10 nM 1,25D3, as
described previously.20 SCC cells were maintained in
female C3H/HeJ mice ages 6 to 10 weeks (purchased
from Jackson Laboratory; Bar Harbor, Me). The mice
protocols used were approved by the Roswell Park Cancer
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay

SCC or SCC-DR cells were plated on glass coverslips and
treated with ETOH or 10 nM 1,25D3 for 48 hours,
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with
60% acetone/3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and
blocked with 25% normal goat serum at room temperature. Actin filaments were stained with rhodamine-labeled
phalloidin (1:500 dilution; Sigma Chemical Company,
St. Louis, Mo), and nuclei were stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:1000 dilution; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) for 1 hour. Fluorescent images were
captured using a Nikon TE2000-E inverted microscope
(Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with Roper
CoolSnap HQ charged-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, Ariz).

’’Wound’’ Healing Assay

A confluent monolayer of SCC cells was cultured overnight, and a scratch was introduced with a pipette tip.
Then, images of cell migration into the wound were captured at 0 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours using a light
microscope.
Chemotaxis Migration Assay

Chemotactic migration activity was measured by Boydenchamber assay using BioCoat Control Inserts (BD Biosciences, East Rutherford, NJ). SCC or SCC-DR cells
were plated in insert chambers in serum-free RPMI 1640.
The lower chambers were filled with RPMI 1640 with
5% fetal bovine serum. After 16 hours of incubation, cells
that did not migrate were removed from the upper chambers with a cotton swab, and cells that had migrated
through the pore membrane were identified by Diff-Quik
Stain Set (Dade Behring, Newark, Del), examined, and
counted under brightfield microscopy.
Invasion Assay

Invasion activity was measured by using a Boyden-chamber assay with BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers,
as in the chemotaxis migration assay, except that a longer
incubation time of 48 hours was used. The results are
expressed as follows: percentage invasion index ¼ (the
number of cells migrating through the collagen-coated
membrane/the number of cells migrating through the
uncoated control membrane).
In Situ Zymography

Glass coverslips were coated with 0.2 mg/mL Oregon
green 488-conjugated gelatin (Invitrogen), cross-linked in
0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 minutes at 4 C, and incubated with 5 mg/mL NaBH4 for 3 minutes. The coverslips were then sterilized with 70% ETOH for 15 minutes
and incubated in serum-free media for 1 hour at 37 C.
SCC or SCC-DR cells were plated on coated coverslips,
treated with ETOH or 10 nM 1,25D3, incubated at 37 C
for 24 hours, and processed by fluorescence microscopy
procedures.
Flow Cytometry

SCC or SCC-DR cells that had been treated with either
ETOH or 10 nM 1,25D3 for 48 hours were harvested
with Trypsin-ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, blocked
with 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 hour, then
incubated either with an immunoglobulin G isotype control or with rabbit anti-E-cadherin 5 lg/mL for 1 hour at
room temperature, and washed twice with PBS. Samples
were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat-antirabbit secondary antibody for 1 hour. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow

cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and
data were analyzed with FCS Express (De Novo Software,
Los Angeles, Calif).
Immunoblot Analysis

Cell lysates were prepared and immunoblot analyses were
performed as described previously.5
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay

The levels of MMP-2 (AbCam, Cambridge, Mass) and
MMP-9 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) secreted
into the culture media were assessed using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay kits according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Immunohistochemistry

For immunohistochemistry studies, SCC cells (4.5 
105) were inoculated subcutaneously into the flank of
C3H mice. Mice were treated for 3 days with single, daily,
intraperitoneal injections of either saline or 0.625 lg/
mouse of 1,25D3 when tumors were palpable. On day 4,
tumor tissues were harvested, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 microns. Slides
were deparafinized in xylene, rehydrated, and incubated
with 10% normal goat serum followed by avidin/biotin
block (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif) to block
nonspecific binding. Anti-E-cadherin antibody (1:500
dilution; catalog no. 610181; BD Biosciences) was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by
biotinylated horse antimouse secondary antibody (Vector
Laboratories) for 15 minutes. ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) was then applied for 30 minutes. To reveal endogenous peroxidase activity, slides were incubated with
3,30 -diaminobenzidine substrate (Dako, Carpinteria,
Calif) for 5 minutes and counterstained with modified
Harris hematoxylin (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, Mich) for 20 seconds. The slides were dehydrated,
and the coverslips were mounted with Permount (Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa).
Small Interfering RNA Transfection

siGENOME small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific
for E-cadherin, nonspecific siRNA (siRNA-NS), and
DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent were purchased
from Dharmacon (Lafayette, Colo). SCC cells were transfected with 50 nM siRNA-NS or siRNA-E-cadherin for
24 hours using DharmaFECT 1 according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Lung
Metastasis

Experimental MRI studies were performed using 4.7 T/
33-cm horizontal bore magnet (GE NMR Instruments,
Cancer

February 1, 2013

Fremont, Calif) that incorporated a removable gradient
coil insert (G060; Bruker Medical Inc., Billerica, Mass)
and generated a maximum field strength of 950 mT/m
with a custom-designed, 35-mm radiofrequency transmit-receive coil. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia
during imaging were achieved by inhalation of 2% to 3%
Isoflurane in oxygen (Abbott Laboratories, Abbot Park,
Ill). Animal body temperature was maintained at 37 C
during imaging using an air heater system (SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY). Animals were placed prone
on a magnetic resonance-compatible sled (Dazai Research
Instruments, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) within a carrier
tube and positioned to ensure placement of the thoracic
region of the mice in the isocenter of the magnet. Global
shimming was performed at the beginning of imaging to
ensure optimal field homogeneity. Preliminary scout
images were acquired on the sagittal plane for localization
and for determination of subsequent slice prescriptions.
Coronal T2-weighted (T2W) images were acquired with
the following parameters: field of view (FOV), 4.8  3.2
cm; matrix, 256  192; slice thickness, 1.00 mm; effective
echo time (TEeff), 41 msec; repetition time (TR), 2424
msec; number of averages, 4. In total, 21 slices were
acquired across the thoracic region to cover the entire lung
area. Axial T2W images were acquired using the same
sequence (FOV, 3.2  3.2; 25 slices). The duration of the
imaging session for each animal, including induction of
anesthesia, positioning, and set up, was approximately 20
minutes. After image acquisition, raw image sets were
transferred to a processing workstation and processed
using the medical imaging software Analyze (AnalyzeDirect, version 7.0; Overland Park, Kan). Tumor volumes
(mm3) were calculated from the manually traced tumor
area in each acquired slice and the slice thickness.
Ex Vivo Quantification of Experimental Lung
Metastasis

For experimental metastasis, 105 SCC cells or 3  105
SCC-DR cells were injected into tail veins of C3H/HeJ
mice (6 per group). Lung tumor development was monitored by MRI weekly. The mice with SCC tumors were
killed at 2 weeks after transplantation, and those with
SCC-DR tumors were killed 5 to 7 weeks after transplantation. The upper trachea was sealed using 4-0 silk, and
the lungs were removed and stained with intrathecally
administered 5% (volume/volume) India ink using a
blunt-end, 21-gauge needle; then, the lungs were fixed in
Fekete solution (100 mL 70% alcohol, 10 mL formalin,
and 5 mL glacial acetic acid), and metastases were scored
as surface lesions excluding ink.

Sample Sizes and Statistical Considerations

For in vitro studies, differences between control and treatment groups were analyzed for statistical significance
using 2-tailed Student t tests. For in vivo imaging studies,
a total of 29 animals underwent experimental MRI examinations for the quantification of pulmonary metastasis. In
the first set of studies, 14 animals were injected with SCC
cells and assigned to 1 of 3 groups: saline (n ¼ 8), 0.3 lg
1,25D3 (n ¼ 3), or 0.6 lg 1,25D3 (n ¼ 3). The MRI
examinations presented in the figures were performed
approximately 11 to 15 days after intravenous injection of
tumor cells to quantify pulmonary tumor burden. In a
second set of studies, 15 animals were injected with SCCDR cells and treated with saline (n ¼ 4), or 0.3 lg 1,25D3
(n ¼ 6), or 0.6 lg 1,25D3 (n ¼ 5), and MRI examinations
were performed approximately 40 to 50 days after injection. Differences in MRI-based tumor volume measurements were analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance using
the Bonferroni multiple comparisons test.
RESULTS
1a,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol Modifies
Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Morphology

To investigate the impact of 1,25D3 on the cellular processes involved in metastasis, we first characterized the phenotype of SCC cells by light microscopy. SCC cells
normally present a polygonal appearance, as indicated in
566

vehicle control ETOH-treated cells (Fig. 1A). However,
1,25D3 induced a different phenotype after 48 hours.
SCC cells were larger and had a flat morphology (Fig.
1A). 1,25D3 did not change the morphology of 1,25D3resistant SCC-DR cells, which were generated through
continuous culture of SCC cells in 1,25D3-containing
media20 (Fig. 1A). Cytoskeletal reorganization is essential
for changing cell shapes, cell migration, and other processes.21 Actin staining revealed a major reorganization of
cell cytoskeleton: Numerous actin stress fibers were
observed throughout cytoplasm of 1,25D3-treated SCC
cells, whereas control cells displayed disorganized actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 1B). In contrast, 1,25D3 did not change
the morphology or actin staining pattern of SCC-DR cells
(Fig. 1), indicating the critical role of 1,25D3 in cytoskeletal reorganization.
1a,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol Inhibits
Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Migration

Actin polymerization is a major factor involved in cell
migration.22 Therefore, next, we examined the ability of
1,25D3 to modify cell motility using the scratch
‘‘wound’’ healing and Boyden chamber-based chemotaxis
assays. In the wound healing assay, ETOH-treated SCC
cells covered at least 50% of the gap at 24 hours and covered almost the entire damaged area by 48 hours (Fig.

SCC cells. It is noteworthy that 1,25D3 inhibited the
migration of SCC-DR cells (P < .01), but the inhibition
was substantially less than that observed in SCC cells
(Fig. 2B). These results indicate that 1,25D3 suppresses
the motility of SCC cells.

1a,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol Inhibits
Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Invasion

To explore the effect of 1,25D3 on the invasiveness of
SCC cells, the Matrigel-based invasion chamber assay and
an in situ gelatin-degradation assay were performed.
1,25D3 significantly (P < .01) reduced the invasion of
SCC cells through Matrigel membrane (Fig. 3A). Gelatinase activity (indicating the activity of MMP-2 and MMP9) was assessed by in situ zymography. The ability of SCC
cells to degrade matrix in situ was markedly suppressed by
1,25D3 treatment, as indicated by the reduced Oregon
568

green-labeled gelatin-degradation areas that appeared as
black holes (Fig. 3B). In contrast, neither the invasiveness
nor the matrix-degradation potential of SCC-DR cells
was affected by 1,25D3 (Fig. 3A,B). The expression levels
of gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed by immunoblot analysis, and markedly reduced expression of
both was observed in SCC cells that were treated with
1,25D3 (Fig. 3C). Supporting these findings, the levels of
MMP-2 and MMP-9 secreted into cell culture media
were reduced by the treatment of 10 nM or 100 nM
1,25D3 in SCC cells (Fig. 3D).

E-Cadherin Contributes to
1a,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol-Reduced
Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Motility

E-cadherin is involved in cell polarity, structure, and invasion. Therefore, next, we investigated whether 1,25D3induced morphology and motility changes in SCC cells
were associated with changes in E-cadherin expression.
1,25D3 markedly induced the expression of membrane Ecadherin in SCC cells as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig.
4A). The expression of E-cadherin was not modified in
SCC-DR cells (Fig. 4A). In line with this finding, the
results from immunoblot analysis indicated enhanced Ecadherin expression upon 1,25D3 treatment in SCC cells
(Fig. 4B). To examine whether E-cadherin was modulated
in vivo, SCC or SCC-DR tumor-bearing mice were
treated with 1,25D3 for 3 days. Tumors were collected,
and E-cadherin levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The treatment with 1,25D3 markedly promoted the expression of E-cadherin in SCC tumors but
not in SCC-DR tumors (Fig. 4C).

To study whether E-cadherin plays a role in 1,25D3-regulated cell migration, siRNA/E-cadherin was used to
knockdown E-cadherin expression in SCC cells, as confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5A) and immunoblot
analysis (Fig. 5B). Knockdown of E-cadherin promoted
SCC cell migration, indicating that E-cadherin contributes to SCC motility (Fig. 5C). 1,25D3 treatment suppressed the migration of control siRNA-NS–transfected
SCC cells but to a lesser degree than it suppressed the
migration of siRNA/E-cadherin–transfected SCC cells
(Fig. 5C). This result indicated that siRNA-E-cadherin
rescued SCC cell migration inhibited by 1,25D3, which
could be observed more easily when migration was normalized to siRNA-NS control (Fig. 5D). Together, these
findings suggest that the 1,25D3-suppressed SCC cell
migration may be caused at least in part by increased
expression of E-cadherin.

1a,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol Inhibits the
Formation of Lung Metastases in Squamous
Cell Carcinoma Tumors

Because 1,25D3 markedly inhibited SCC cell migration
and invasion, we next examined the in vivo effect of
1,25D3 on metastasis using a lung tumor colony-formation mouse model. Noninvasive MRI was used to quantify tumor burden in the lungs after intravenous injection
of SCC or SCC-DR cells. Coronal and axial T2W images
provided adequate contrast for detecting the lesions in
relation to the healthy lung parenchyma. In saline-treated
control animals that were injected with SCC cells, multiple bilateral lesions were visible on multislice T2W images
(Fig. 6A, top left). In contrast, treatment with 1,25D3
resulted in a marked reduction (P < .0001) in pulmonary
570

tumor nodules (Fig. 6A). MRI studies of the animals that
were injected with SCC-DR cells revealed a distinct pattern of tumor formation with large masses visible in the
lungs (Fig. 6A, bottom left). Treatment with 1,25D3 did
not appear to result in any inhibition of tumor growth in
the SCC-DR model system. Ex vivo macroscopic analysis
of lungs was performed after intrathecal instillation of
India ink to permit the visualization of lung tumor colonies (Fig. 6B) and to validate imaging findings. Consistent
with the MRI data, a marked reduction in tumor colonies
was observed in 1,25D3-treated animals injected with
SCC cells compared with saline-treated controls. Histologic examination of lung tissue sections obtained from
saline-treated animals injected with SCC cells revealed

from animals that had been treated with 1,25D3 revealed
the presence of healthy lung tissue with fewer areas of malignant transformation. Conversely, 1,25D3 did not alter
the histology of lung tissues obtained from animals that
were injected with SCC-DR cells (Fig. 6C). These results
indicate that 1,25D3 strongly inhibits the formation of

DISCUSSION
There is growing evidence that 1,25D3 may have antitumor activity in several cancer types, including colorectal,
breast, prostate, ovarian, and skin cancers. In addition to

suppressing cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis,
1,25D3 affects angiogenesis and tumor metastasis.5,23-25
However, the mechanisms for these anticancer effects
remain unclear, and further investigations are needed.
In the current study, we demonstrated that 1,25D3
modulates the morphology of SCC cells from polygonal
to a larger and more flattened shape. Pendas-Franco et al
demonstrated that MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer
cells underwent different morphology changes upon
1,25D3 treatment, from a rounded shape to polygonal
and flattened.26 The assembly of actin stress fibers was
observed in both studies, indicating a role for 1,25D3 in
regulating organization of the cytoskeleton, which may
lead to changes in cell shape and motility.
Modulation of cell cytoskeleton organization may
affect cell motility. Further studies using ‘‘wound’’ healing
assay and chemotactic migration assay have demonstrated
that 1,25D3 inhibits the migration and chemotaxis of
SCC cells. The invasiveness of SCC cells also is markedly
suppressed by 1,25D3, as demonstrated in the Matrigel
Boyden chamber assay and by in situ zymography, which
is a unique and important technique for revealing proteolytic activity at specific sites in tissues or cell cultures. This
is associated with reduced expression and secretion of
MMP-2 and MMP-9 in SCC cells, as indicated in immunoblot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
analysis, respectively.
The mechanisms for 1,25D3-mediated inhibition of
tumor cell motility are not well understood. 1,25D3
reduced the invasion of the Lewis lung carcinoma cancer
cell line LLC-LN7 through matrix-coated membranes,
and this effect was associated with decreased protein kinase A activity.27 Young et al studied LLC-LN7 cells and
demonstrated that 1,25D3-suppressed tumor cell motility
was associated with the inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor production.28 1,25D3
also inhibited invasion of prostate cancer cell lines
LNCaP, PC-3 and DU145, as assessed by Matrigel invasion assay, and that inhibition was associated with
decreased MMP-9 and cathepsin activity and increased
activity of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 1.15
1,25D3 may play an opposite role in motility in normal
cells. Rebsamen et al noted the enhanced cell motility of
benign vascular smooth muscle cells in association with
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.29 The possible
differential regulation of cell motility may be beneficial in
cancer treatment, because it may spare normal cells from
adverse effects.
E-cadherin mediates cell-cell adhesion, and the disruption of strong cell-cell adhesion leads to the invasion
572

and metastasis of tumor cells.30 Loss of E-cadherin not
only causes deregulation of cytoskeleton and loss of cell
polarity but also leads to increased cell motility and invasiveness,31 possibly because E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell
adhesion promotes cell clusters and, thus, restricts cell
motility toward the extracellular matrix. Cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin often is lost with the development of invasiveness in epithelial cancer.32 E-cadherin
loss may be because of several mechanisms. MicroRNA 9
(miR-9) inhibits E-cadherin expression and enhances
mammary epithelial cell motility and invasiveness, and
the silencing of miR-9 in breast cancer cells suppressed
lung metastasis in an orthotopic implantation model.33
E-cadherin may be silenced by DNA hypermethylation
around the promoter region in premalignant situations.34
MMPs can proteolytically cleave and disrupt the function
of E-cadherin.31 Therefore, restoring the function of Ecadherin may inhibit tumor metastasis.
In the current study, we have identified a novel link
between 1,25D3-induced E-cadherin expression and
decreased cell migration. 1,25D3 promotes the expression
of E-cadherin in SCC cells and tumors, as demonstrated
by flow cytometry, immunoblot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. E-cadherin induction depends on the
vitamin D receptor gene (VDR), because 1,25D3 did
not affect E-cadherin levels in SCC-DR cells, which have
defective VDR signaling.20 In line with our data, another
study revealed that 1,25D3 induced the expression of Ecadherin in colon carcinoma cells.35 We have demonstrated for the first time that the silencing of E-cadherin
by siRNA rescues 1,25D3-inhibited SCC cell migration.
These data indicate that 1,25D3-enhanced E-cadherin
expression contributes to 1,25D3-mediated inhibition of
SCC cell motility.
With the observation that 1,25D3 strongly inhibits
SCC cell motility and invasion in vitro, next, we investigated the effect of 1,25D3 in vivo in an experimental
mouse model, in which SCC cells were injected intravenously into mice and tumor growth in lungs was monitored. By using in vivo MRI studies and ex vivo
macroscopic and microscopic analyses, we demonstrated
that 1,25D3 markedly suppresses the ability of SCC cells
to establish pulmonary metastases. It is noteworthy that,
compared with SCC cells, it takes much longer for SCCDR cells to form tumor colonies in lungs after being introduced intravenously in mice, and they form fewer colonies
than SCC cells. This may be because SCC-DR cells
express higher levels of endogenous E-cadherin compared
with SCC cells, as indicated by our flow cytometry and
immunoblot analyses, and thus have decreased ability to

migrate and invade. However, our experimental metastasis model has intrinsic limitations, because cancer cells are
introduced directly into the circulation; therefore, the
model cannot evaluate the initial metastasis processes
when cancer cells need to escape from the primary tumor
site, invade through the basement membrane, migrate
and invade through the surrounding tissue, and then enter
the circulation. Spontaneous metastasis models should be
used if feasible.
In support of our current findings, others have demonstrated that 1,25D3 inhibits metastatic growth in several tumor models. 1,25D3 suppressed spontaneous and
experimental pulmonary metastasis of B16 mouse melanoma.25 22-oxa-1,25D3 reduced lung colony formation
in an intravenous injection model and reduced angiogenesis in a basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis model.36 The vitamin D analog EB1089 suppressed
the occurrence of bone metastasis in a breast cancer metastasis model.37 1,25D3 or 22-oxa-1,25D3 treatment suppressed lung metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma cells in
an intravenous injection mouse model.36 Although preclinical models support an antimetastatic role for 1,25D3,
further studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that 1,25D3 modulates SCC cell morphology and actin arrangement. In
addition, 1,25D3 inhibits SCC cell motility, possibly
through the promotion of E-cadherin expression. 1,25D3
inhibits the invasiveness of SCC cells, which is associated
with decreased expression and secretion of MMP-2 and
MMP-9. In vivo, 1,25D3 suppressed SCC lung metastasis
in an experimental model approximating metastasis.
Although further mechanistic investigation into the regulation of metastasis by 1,25D3 is necessary, the observed
antimetastatic activity of 1,25D3 in multiple preclinical
model systems supports its evaluation in the clinical
setting.
