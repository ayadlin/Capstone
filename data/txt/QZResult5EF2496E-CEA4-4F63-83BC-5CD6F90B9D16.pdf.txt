ABSTRACT
Deletion of ovarian carcinoma 2/disabled homolog 2 (DOC-2/DAB2) interacting
protein (DAB2IP), is a tumor suppressor that serves as a scaffold protein involved in
coordinately regulating cell proliferation, survival and apoptotic pathways. DAB2IP is
epigenetically down-regulated in a variety of tumors through the action of the histone
methyltransferase EZH2. Although DAB2IP is transcriptionally down-regulated in a
variety of tumors, it remains unclear if other mechanisms contribute to functional
inactivation of DAB2IP. Here we demonstrate that DAB2IP can be functionally
down-regulated by two independent mechanisms. First, we identified that Akt1 can
phosphorylate DAB2IP on S847, which regulates the interaction between DAB2IP and
its effector molecules H-Ras and TRAF2. Second, we demonstrated that DAB2IP can
be degraded in part through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by SCFFbw7. DAB2IP
harbors two Fbw7 phosho-degron motifs, which can be regulated by the kinase CK1δ.
Our data indicate that in addition to epigenetic down-regulation, two additional
pathways can functionally inactivate DAB2IP. Given that DAB2IP has previously
been identified to possess direct causal role in tumorigenesis and metastasis, our
data indicate that a variety of pathways may pass through DAB2IP to govern cancer
development, and therefore highlight DAB2IP agonists as potential therapeutic
approaches for future anti-cancer drug development.

INTRODUCTION

ovarian carcinoma 2/disabled homolog 2 (DOC-2/
DAB2) interacting protein (DAB2IP), has been described
as a tumor suppressor in various types of cancer [59]. Furthermore, loss of DAB2IP expression during
tumorigenesis is associated with poor prognosis and
increased tumor metastasis [6, 8-11].
DAB2IP is often down-regulated by epigenetic
modification in multiple aggressive cancers. In prostate
cancer, DAB2IP expression was shown to be repressed by
promoter methylation and histone modification, primarily
through the action of the histone methyltransferase EZH2
[12, 13], whereas in breast cancer [6], lung cancer [8],
and gastrointestinal tumors [14], aberrant promoter
hypermethylation was shown to down-regulate DAB2IP.
Moreover, it was shown in prostate cancer that downregulation of DAB2IP expression results in resistance
to ionizing radiation [15], which initiates epithelial-to-

Tumor metastasis is a substantial setback
encountered during clinical anti-cancer treatments, leading
to increased mortality in cancer patients [1]. It has been
well established that for many types of human cancers,
tumor cells acquire the capability to metastasize to distant
organs that ultimately result in organ failure and death
[1, 2]. Therefore, elucidating the underlying molecular
mechanisms that drive tumor growth and metastasis will
provide further impetus for the development of more
effective therapies, in part by eliminating metastatic
cancer cells. Although the mechanisms remain largely
unknown, overexpression of certain oncoproteins [3]
or down-regulation of tumor suppressor proteins [4]
have been demonstrated to play important roles in the
process of tumor growth and metastasis. Deletion of

mesenchymal transition [11] and promotes tumor growth
and metastasis [16]. Mechanistically, DAB2IP is involved
in TNFα-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by
suppressing the ASK1-JNK and PI3K-Akt pathway [11],
and in endothelial cells via the ASK1-JNK pathway [17].
DAB2IP, located on chromosome 9q33.1-q33.3, is
a member of the Ras-GTPase activating protein family
(Ras GAP) that inactivates Ras largely by promoting
conversion of GTP into GDP [18]. Functionally, DAB2IP
serves as a scaffold protein involved in coordinately
regulating cell proliferation, survival and apoptotic
pathways [19]. Through interaction with various factors,
DAB2IP can modulate the activities of various pathways
including Ras-Raf-ERK, ASK1-JNK, and PI3K-Akt,
through which loss of DAB2IP can deregulate survival
and apoptosis pathways, leading to tumor development.
Specifically, DAB2IP inhibits the Ras pathway by directly
binding to and inactivating H-Ras and R-Ras through its
Ras GTPase activity [18], regulates the ASK1 pathway
by blocking interaction of ASK1 with its inhibitor 14-3-3
[17], and binds to and inactivates the Akt kinase [19].
Prostate cancer is largely curable if diagnosed early
in disease progression, however, there are no effective
therapies for metastatic disease. Recent studies have
identified loss of DAB2IP as a regulator of metastatic
prostate cancer, and is one of the few genes with a direct
causal role in driving prostate cancer metastasis. Loss of
DAB2IP has roles in both tumor initiation and metastasis,
whereby loss of DAB2IP controls primary tumor growth
through activating Ras and drives metastasis through
controlling NF-κB through regulation of TRAF2 [16].
Although DAB2IP is often epigenetically down regulated
in a variety of cancers through EZH2 activation, we set
out to determine if DAB2IP can also be functionally
inactivated through signaling or degradation pathways. To
this end, we have identified that DAB2IP is functionally
inactivated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation, controlling
DAB2IP activity on both the Ras and TRAF2 downstream
effector molecules. In addition, we have identified that
DAB2IP protein levels can be controlled by Fbw7mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.

these consensus sequences could serve as a bona fide
phosphorylation site in DAB2IP, we tested if any Akt
or similar kinases (Akt1, Akt2, SGK and ribosomal S6
kinase (S6K)) were able to phosphorylate DAB2IP. Using
a phospho-Akt substrate specific antibody, we found that
only Akt1 expression led to increased phosphorylation of
DAB2IP (Figure 1B). By mutating each phosphorylation
site within the two consensus Akt motifs, we found that
S847 was primarily phosphorylated by Akt1 (Figure 1C).
These data indicate that Akt1 can phosphorylate DAB2IP
in the carboxy terminus at S847.

RESULTS
DAB2IP is phosphorylated by Akt1

Previous studies demonstrated that DAB2IP is
epigenetically down regulated in many tumors through
the action of EZH2 or promoter methylation [6, 8, 12-14].
We set out to determine if there are additional mechanisms
functionally regulating DAB2IP. Scanning the DAB2IP
protein sequence, we identified two consensus Akt sites
(RxRxxpS/T) located in the carboxy terminus of DAB2IP
at Serine-847 and Serine-907 (Figure 1A). To test if

Phosphorylated DAB2IP blocks interaction with
H-Ras and TRAF2

and Ras is controlled in part through Akt1-dependent
phosphorylation in the C-terminus of DAB2IP.
In addition to TRAF2, DAB2IP has been shown to
regulate the Ras-ERK signaling pathway, where depletion
of DAB2IP leads to MAPK pathway activation (Figure
2C and [16, 19]). To test if phosphorylation at the Akt site
of DAB2IP is important for its ability to control MAPK
pathway activation, we assessed the MAPK activation in
PC3 cells, which have limited expression of DAB2IP. We
found that expression of wild-type DAB2IP resulted in
lower MAPK activation as measured by phosphorylation
of ERK (Figure 2D). Expression of the phospho-mimetic
mutant (S847D) of DAB2IP resulted in an increase in
MAPK activation (Figure 2D). Induced MAPK activity
that we observed with phosphorylation at S847D was
similar to what was observed for a catalytically inactive
RasGAP mutant of DAB2IP (R289L), suggesting that
the regulation of DAB2IP binding to Ras was important
for DAB2IP to control MAPK activity. Therefore, our
results indicate that phosphorylation at S847 of DAB2IP is
important for its downstream effector functions, and thus
regulation of the phosphorylation status at S847 may be
important for the tumor suppressor roles of DAB2IP.

Loss of DAB2IP was shown to trigger Ras, ERK
and Akt activation [16], and interact with TRAF2 via its
C-terminal domain [20]. Interestingly, our identified Akt1
phosphorylation site lies in the C-terminus of the prolinerich interaction domain in DAB2IP that is involved in
binding TRAF2 and ASK1. To test if phosphorylation at
S847 by Akt1 also influences the association of DAB2IP
and TRAF2, we tested the interaction of phospho-mimetic
(S847D) and non-phosphorylatable (S847A) DAB2IP
mutants with TRAF2. Notably, we found that the DAB2IP
S847A mutant bound more efficiently while the DAB2IP
S847D mutant had reduced binding to TRAF2 (Figure
2A). Likewise, we found that the ability of DAB2IP to
bind to Ras was also affected by the phosphorylation
status of DAB2IP as the non-phosphorylatable mutant
(S847A) showing increased interaction, while a
phosphomimetic substitution (S847D) showing reduced
binding (Figure 2B). These results indicate that the ability
of the scaffold protein DAB2IP to interact with TRAF2

DAB2IP interacts with Cullin-Ring E3 ligases

and Cullin-4A, while it did not interact with Cullin-2,
Cullin-3, or Cullin-5 (Figure 3A). Cullin-1 based E3
ligases are the most well studied Cullin-Ring complexes,
and are named SCF complexes due to the presence of
the components Skp1, Cullin-1 and an associated F-box
protein that directs substrate recognition. Consistent with
an interaction between Cullin-1 and DAB2IP, we found
that DAB2IP interacted with Rbx1 and Skp1, common
complex component of Cullin-1 based SCF complexes
(Figure 3B and 3C). Furthermore, depletion of cells with
Cullin-1 shRNA resulted in an increase in DAB2IP protein
abundance (Figure 3D).

Given that DAB2IP is a potent tumor suppressor,
and is down-regulated in a variety of human tumors, we
wanted to next determine if DAB2IP is actively regulated
by proteasome-mediated degradation in addition to being
functionally regulated by phosphorylation. To this end, the
ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays an important
role in the timely regulation of key cellular proteins and
thereby controlling many cellular processes including
cell signaling and cell cycle regulation [21]. Dysfunction
of the UPS is involved in the development of numerous
diseases including cancer [22, 23].
It is well established that Cullin-Ring complexes are
the largest family of E3 ligases. Therefore, we determined
whether a specific Cullin-Ring E3 ligase interacts with
DAB2IP. We found that DAB2IP interacted with Cullin-1

substrate recognition components of the SCF complex,
and dysregulation of these F-box proteins can contribute
to cancer development [24-26]. Scanning the DAB2IP
protein sequence, we identified two potential phosphodegron sequences (S15 and S578) that share partial
homology to the consensus Fbw7 substrate recognition
motif (Figure 4A). We found that Fbw7 interacted with
DAB2IP (Figure 4B), indicating a role for Fbw7 as the
F-Box protein involved in recruiting DAB2IP to the
SCF complex. Fbw7 is frequently mutated in T-ALL,
and plays a critical role in T-ALL cancer development
[27], where common mutations in Fbw7 found in T-ALL
abrogate interaction between Fbw7 and substrate proteins.
Consistent with DAB2IP being a substrate of Fbw7, we
found that three T-ALL associated mutations in Fbw7
(R465H, R479L, and R505C) no longer interacted with
DAB2IP (Figure 4B), providing further evidence that
DAB2IP interaction with Fbw7 is through the substrate
recognition domain of Fbw7. We next tested if mutation

of the Fbw7 phospho-degron motifs in DAB2IP would
influence binding between DAB2IP and Fbw7. Mutation
of Serine-15 and Serine-578 in DAB2IP resulted in loss of
binding between DAB2IP and Fbw7 (Figure 4C). These
results suggest that the substrate recognition F-Box motif
in Fbw7 binds to the Fbw7 phospho-degron motif in
DAB2IP.
Considering that DAB2IP interacts with SCFFbw7,
we wanted to next determine if this Cullin-Ring E3 ligase
controls the stability of DAB2IP. To test this, we depleted
Fbw7 and assessed protein abundance of DAB2IP. We
observed that knockdown of Fbw7 resulted in an increase
in DAB2IP protein (Figure 4D). Additionally, deletion of
Fbw7 in HCT116 cells also led to an increase in DAB2IP
protein abundance (Figure 4E). Our results indicate that
Fbw7 promotes the degradation of DAB2IP through
recruitment to SCFFbw7 complex.

degradation of DAB2IP

interaction

and

through additional downstream pathways dysregulated by
inhibition of DAB2IP. Therefore, targeting this feedback
loop through increasing DAB2IP protein abundance or
function could be a unique therapeutic possibility.
In addition to functional inactivation of DAB2IP
by Akt, we identified that DAB2IP is also targeted for
proteasome-mediated degradation driven by the SCFFbw7
E3 ubiquitin ligase. To this end, we have identified
that the SCFFbw7 E3 ubiquitin ligase interacts with, and

Fbw7-mediated degradation often depends on the
presence of a phospho-degron motif in the target protein.
Mutation of both of these serine residues led to a decrease
in binding between Fbw7 and DAB2IP (Figure 4C),
indicating that one, or both, of these motifs are important
for interaction between DAB2IP and Fbw7. To determine
which kinase is involved in regulating the phosphorylation
of the DAB2IP degron motifs, we tested whether CK1α/β,
CK1δ, GSK3, or ERK1 could alter protein abundance of
DAB2IP. We found that overexpression of CK1δ led to a
decrease in DAB2IP (Figure 5A). Furthermore, depletion
of CK1δ resulted in an increase in DAB2IP protein
abundance (Figure 5B). Our data is consistent with the
notion that degradation of DAB2IP by SCFFbw7 requires
phosphorylation within the degron motif in DAB2IP,
which is possibly carried out by CK1δ.

DISCUSSION
DAB2IP is an emerging tumor suppressor, which
is often epigenetically down-regulated in cancer. Given
a direct causal role of DAB2IP in regulating cancer
metastasis, we hypothesize that DAB2IP could be
targeted for functional inactivation through additional
posttranslational mechanisms. Here we identified two
independent pathways that can negatively regulate
DAB2IP function; inactivation through Akt mediated
phosphorylation and degradation through SCFFbw7mediated ubiquitination and degradation.
Although DAB2IP is often epigenetically down
regulated by EZH2 activation in many tumors, we defined
a novel pathway of functionally inactivating DAB2IP in
prostate cancer cells through Akt activity. We identified
an Akt consensus sequence in DAB2IP, and demonstrated
that this site is a possible target of Akt. Furthermore,
we have found that phosphorylation of this site directly
affects DAB2IP association with Ras and TRAF proteins,
implicating this modification in controlling DAB2IP
regulation of downstream effector pathways. This is of
particular interest as Akt is negatively regulated by PTEN,
suggesting that the loss of PTEN in prostate cancer could
possibly inactivate DAB2IP through Akt activation,
thereby perhaps leading to greater prevalence of prostate
cancer metastasis (Figure 5C)
Recent results have shown that DAB2IP can
suppress the Akt pathway through direct interaction
[19]. Therefore, in addition to Akt inactivating DAB2IP,
DAB2IP control of Akt can lead to a positive feedback
loop. Where increased Akt activity will further induce
itself through negative regulation of DAB2IP. This
feedback loop therefore leads to even greater Akt activity
in cell, which are also primed to undergo metastasis

promotes the degradation of, DAB2IP. Furthermore,
we have identified a phospho-degron motif within
DAB2IP that is commonly utilized by Fbw7 for substrate
recruitment to the SCF complex. We have identified CK1δ
as a potential upstream modifying kinase regulating the
phosphorylation of this Fbw7 phospho-degron motif
within DAB2IP. Overexpression and knockdown of CK1δ
leads to the loss and stabilization of DAB2IP, respectively,
suggesting a direct role for CK1δ in mediating the
degradation of DAB2IP by Fbw7. Identifying key
pathways regulating degradation of DAB2IP could prove
to be a potential therapeutic target by restoring DAB2IP
protein abundance through inhibition of its degradation.
Recent studies have indicated that DAB2IP downregulation has implications in resistance to ionizing
radiation [15], initiation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition [11] and promotes tumor growth and metastasis
[16]. Here, by identifying that the protein stability of
DAB2IP is regulated by the SCFFbw7 E3 ubiquitin ligase,
suggests that utilizing inhibitors of this E3 ligase complex
could serve as a mechanism to block these processes by
protecting DAB2IP protein levels in cellular contexts
where DAB2IP expression is suppressed.
Interestingly, Fbw7 is often referred to as a tumor
suppressor for its roles in regulating the degradation of
potent oncogenes such as Cyclin E, c-Myc, c-Jun, Mcl1, mTOR and Notch-1 [28]. Here we find that Fbw7 is
involved in the degradation of a tumor suppressor. This
has also recently been the case for another RasGAP
molecules, neurofibromin (or NF1), which is also a known
tumor suppressor [29]. The role of FBW7 regulating two
known tumor suppressors, both of which are RasGAPs, for
degradation, suggest a potential unifying role of DAB2IP
and NF1 being under the control of Fbw7-mediated
degradation which requires further studies of these
pathways and their stability control by Fbw7 to elucidate
the implications in cancer development and progression.
Given a causal role for DAB2IP in driving
progression of prostate cancer towards metastasis, and
the prevalence of PTEN loss early in prostate cancer
development, understanding how DAB2IP is regulated
is of critical importance. In summary, our results identify
two new pathways leading to the functional inactivation
of the tumor suppressor DAB2IP through Akt-mediated
phosphorylation and SCFFbw7-mediated degradation. Our
work further suggest that in part by restoring DAB2IP
expression to suppress cancer cell growth, proliferation
and metastasis, Akt inhibitors or Fbw7/CKI inhibitors may
be beneficial in treating various types of human cancers,
particularly metastatic cancers that are associated with
poor survival rates.
