The novel structural proteins (NSPs) are encoded
by a family of related but distinct cDNAs expressed
from a single gene [1]. This gene corresponds to locus
HCMOGT-1 on chromosome 17p11.2 and encodes
NSP5a3a and three other splice variants. NSP5a3a is
highly expressed in some tumor cell lines and in the
testis but not in other normal body tissues [1]. Further
studies revealed that NSP5a3a interacts with the nucleolar
phosphoprotein B23, which plays multiple roles in cell
growth and proliferation [2] and with hnRNP-L [3].
In this issue of Oncotarget, D’Agostino and Giordano
investigate the effect of over-expressing NSP5a3a in
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell
lines [4]. HNSCC is one of the 10 most common cancers
worldwide and the overall survival rate for HNSCC is
still low even with the latest innovations in both basic and
clinical research [5]. Thus, there is an urgent requirement
to identify novel targets for HNSCC. The present study
indicates that NSP5a3a may represent such a potential
target. When NSP5a3a was over-expressed in HN30
HNSCC cells, there was a robust induction of apoptosis.
The authors went on to investigate the molecular
mechanisms involved in the effects of NSP5a3a in HN30
and FADU HNSCC cells and found no changes in p53,
B23, Bax or caspase 3 but a possible involvement of p73.
These data raise some interesting questions: “could
NSP5a3a be a target for the therapy of HNSCC?” and
“could agonists of NSP5a3a be developed and used in
combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for
HNSCC?”. The development of such therapies likely
requires a more detailed elucidation of the mechanism
of action of NSP5a3a involving characterizing NSP5a3a
biochemically and the development of inhibitors/
agonists for the signal transduction pathways involved. In
conclusion, these data are an interesting starting point to
investigate the role of this protein in cancer in general and
HNSCC in particular.
