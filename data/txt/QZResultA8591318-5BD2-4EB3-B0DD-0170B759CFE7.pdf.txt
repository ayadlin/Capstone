ABSTRACT
Epigenetic alterations have emerged as an important cause of microRNA
(miRNA) deregulation. In Multiple Myeloma (MM), a few tumor suppressive miRNAs
silenced by DNA hypermethylation have been reported, but so far there are few
systemic investigations on epigenetically silenced miRNAs. We conducted genomewide screening for tumor suppressive miRNAs epigenetically silenced in MM. Four
Human MM Cell lines were treated with demethylating agent 5’azacytidine (5’aza).
Consistently upregulated miRNAs include miR-155, miR-198, miR-135a*, miR-200c,
miR-125a-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-483-5p, miR-663, and miR-630. Methylation array
analysis revealed increased methylation at or near miRNA-associated CpG islands in
MM patients. Ectopic restoration of miR-155, miR-198, miR-135a*, miR-200c, miR-663
and miR-483-5p significantly repressed MM cell proliferation, migration and colony
formation. Furthermore, we derived a 33-gene signature from predicted miRNA target
genes that were also upregulated in MM patients and associated with patient survival
in three independent myeloma datasets. In summary, we have revealed important,
epigenetically silenced tumor suppressive miRNAs by pharmacologic reversal of
epigenetic silencing.

INTRODUCTION

transcriptional silencing through imperfect pairing with
the 3’ Untranslated Region (3’UTR) of protein-coding
transcripts in animals. They are highly conserved across
different species and regulate most cellular processes.
Deregulation of miRNA is implicated in pathogenesis
and malignant progression of solid and hematological
malignancies.[5] Reduced miRNA expression is often
observed, suggesting that some of these miRNAs act
as tumor suppressors (TS).[6] The silencing of TSmiRNAs leads to activation of oncogenes and contribute
to carcinogenesis.[7] Although several mechanisms
contributing to abnormal silencing of miRNAs have
been discovered, repression of TS-miRNA by epigenetic
mechanism such as promoter hypermethylation and/or
inhibitory histone modification has emerged as a major
cause.[8, 9] A number of TS-miRNAs silenced in MM
have been identified, such as the miR-194-2-192 cluster,

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell (PC)
malignancy characterized by clonal accumulation
of plasma cells in the bone marrow.[1] MM usually
develops from an asymptomatic premalignant stage
called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance (MGUS). This benign condition can progress
to myeloma or related malignancies at a rate of ~1% per
year.[2] In a fraction of patients, tumor could also occur
in extramedullary sites such as blood, a condition called
plasma cell leukemia (PCL).[3] Despite considerable
improvements of patient survival and treatment options,
it remains largely incurable and novel treatment strategies
are needed.[4]

miR-34b/c and miR-203 whose promoters are frequently
hypermethylated.[10-12]
In this study, we conducted genome-wide screening
for TS-miRNAs in MM using 5’azacytidine (5’aza) which
induces DNA hypomethylation and gene reactivation
by inhibiting the action of DNA Methyltransferases
(DNMTs).[13] We identified miRNAs that were
consistently upregulated by 5’aza, including miRNAs
previously reported to be downregulated in MM patients
for unknown reason, and miRNAs with known tumor
suppressor functions in other cancers but had not been
reported in MM. These miRNAs showed increased level
of methylation in MM patients compared with normal
plasma cells. Synthetic mimics of these miRNAs reduced
MM cell proliferation, migration and colony formation. In
addition, these miRNAs were predicted to target mRNAs
upregulated in MM including a gene signature relevant to
patient survival.

upregulated. (Supplementary Table S1) Among the
miRNAs commonly upregulated by 5’aza, miR-125a3p, miR-135a*, miR-188-5p, miR-198, miR-200c and
miR-155 were reported previously to be under-expressed
in MM as compared with normal plasma cells.[14, 15]
MiR-135a*, miR-188-5p, miR-663 and miR-483-5p were
downregulated in plasma cell leukemia.[16] Moreover,
miR-483-5p, miR-663 and miR-630 had been reported to
have tumor suppressor properties in other cancers.[17-19]
These 9 miRNAs were selected as leading TS-miRNA
candidates. (Table 1) The result of miRNA array was
validated using TaqMan miRNA assay (Supplementary
Figure S1). To validate that the upregulation of miRNA
was due to demethylation, Methylation-Specific PCR was
conducted on representative miRNAs with clearly defined
CpG islands near the transcription start site (TSS) of the
miRNA or its host gene. Indeed, 5’aza treatment reduced
the ratio of overall methylated molecules to unmethylated
molecules (Supplementary Figure S2).

RESULTS

miRNAs consistently upregulated by 5’aza are
frequently hypermethylated in MM patients

Specific miRNAs are consistently upregulated by
5’aza

Hypermethylation of CpG sites within the promoters
(often marked by presence of CpG islands) of genes is
often associated with suppression of transcription, a feature
often found in human cancers.[20] Recent studies have
shown that not only in promoters, the hypermethylation
of CpG sites in CpG island shores as well as intragenic
and intergenic CpG sites can also lead to silencing.[21-23]
Therefore, the methylation status of CpG sites near the
TSS of pre-miRNAs, both upstream and downstream, and
host genes of the 9 TS-miRNA candidates was examined
in 17 clincal MM samples and 5 normal controls profiled

Four MM cell lines (H929, MM1S, OPM2,
8226) were treated with 5’aza or DMSO control, and
the expression profiles of miRNAs were generated by
miRNA expression profiling. 5’aza produced widespread
and consistent change in miRNA expression. 74 miRNAs
were upregulated by 1.5 fold or more, in at least 2 cell
lines. These miRNAs were scattered on all chromosomes
except chr17 and Y chromosome, with a few instances of
multiple miRNAs in close proximity being simultaneously

In silico functional analysis of predicted targets of
candidate TS-miRNAs

using Illumina methylation 450 array. Consistent increase
in methylation level was observed in all 9 TS-miRNA
candidates, as compared with healthy controls (Figure 1
and Supplementary Table S2).

To explore the mechanism of action for these
candidate TS-miRNAs, we next analyzed the predicted
mRNA targets of each miRNA. To reduce false positive
predictions, only those genes predicted by at least half of

1354 unique genes were predicted to be the targets of the 9
leading candidate TS-miRNAs. Among these targets, 215
were upregulated in MM compared with normal PCs in a
large public Myeloma Gene Expression Profile dataset[24]
(Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University
of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, GEO accession
number GSE2658; using a cutoff of 1.5 fold and corrected
P-value of 0.005). These 215 genes (Supplementary
Table S3) included oncogenes such as CCND1, BCL9,
and WHSC1. The details of their upregulation in MM
and their functional relevance in cancer were listed in
Supplementary Table S4.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)[25] of
Molecular Signatures Database V3.0 showed significant
enrichment of four gene sets in MM-normal phenotype
comparison using the 215-gene list, including “genes
downregulated in MM cell lines treated with demethylating
agent decitabine and HDAC inhibitor TSA”,[26] which
was consistent with miRNA target prediction since the
downregulation could be attributed to the re-expression
of miRNAs upon treatment, which in turn repressed the
expression of their targets (Supplementary Table S5).
KEGG pathway analysis[27] revealed significant
enrichment of the 215 predicted targets in Adherens
junction pathway (p=0.032) among others (Supplementary
Table S6), suggesting involvement of these genes in cell
adhesion and migration.

viable cells 48 and 72 hours after transfection, compared
with negative control (non-targeting sequence based on
C.elegans miRNAs) (Figure 2).
Migration assay was conducted to compare the
effect on migration of the miRNAs. The result showed
significant repression of MM cell migration by miR-155,
miR-198, miR-135a*, miR-200c, miR-483-5p and miR663 (Figure 3A), Furthermore, the effect of miRNA on
clonogenicity was examined using colony formation
assay. MiR-155, miR-198, miR-200c, miR-483-5p and
miR-663 significantly suppressed colony formation in
MM cells (Figure 3B). The result of functional study was
summarized in Table 2.

Gene expression signature of TS-miRNA target
genes is associated with patient survival
To assess the clinical relevance of the predicted
miRNA targets, the association between survival and
expression of the 215 genes was tested in UAMS dataset
(GSE2658). Of 33 genes independently associated with
survival (p<0.05, Cox regression, Supplementary Table
S7), 19 showed positive association such that higher
expression made patient riskier (C+ group) whereas 14
showed negative association (C- group). The survival
signature was constructed using all 33 genes. The risk
score (RS) for each sample was calculated as RS = U –
D where U = median (EC+) and D = median (EC-) where
EC+ is the median expression level of C+ group probesets/
genes and EC- is the median expression level of C- group
probesets/genes. The survival association was tested
by grouping RS values of a dataset in 4 equally-spaced
levels. As expected, the signature was strongly associated
with overall survival in the UAMS dataset (Figure 4A).
Two other independent myeloma datasets HOVON
(GSE19784) and APEX (GSE9782) were used to validate
the prognostic significance of the signature.[28, 29] Again

Restoration of miRNA expression reduced cell
viability, migration and colony formation
To directly assess the functional relevance of
these miRNAs, synthetic mimic of these miRNAs were
transfected into MM cells. Their re-expression was
confirmed by TaqMan miRNA assay. CellTiter-Glo assay
revealed significant, 10-20% decrease in number of

it was strongly associated with survival with Hazard Ratio
(HR) of 1.51, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of [1.25-1.82]
and p-value of 2.11 × 10-5 in HOVON dataset, and HR of
1.43, 95% CI [1.2-1.7] and p-value of 5.28 × 10-5 in the
APEX dataset (Figure 4B and 4C).

In myeloma, ectopic expression of miR-155 reduced cell
viability in MM1S and OPM2 cells but not H929 and 8226
cells. Moreover, we report tumor suppressor functions of
miR-198, miR-135a*, miR-200c, miR-663 and miR-4835p in myeloma, that they reduced cell viability, migration
and colony formation. These miRNAs are predicted to
target oncogenes such as CCND1, BCL9, HGF, and
WHSC1. CCND1 is a positive cell cycle regulator that is
frequently overexpressed in MM and other cancers;[37,
38] BCL9 confers enhanced proliferation and metastatic
properties to cancer cells;[39] HGF enhances migration
and survival of MM cells;[40] WHSC1 promotes cell
cycle progression and adhesion of MM cells.[41, 42]
Furthermore, we show that the predicted targets could
potentially be of prognostic significance, as it contains
signature that strongly associated with patient survival in
several myeloma datasets.
Zhang et al have recently reported global miRNA
suppression by methylation in myeloma, and specific
miRNAs upregulated by another hypomethylating
agent 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine.[43] However, miRNAs
discovered are different in the two studies. This apparent
discrepancy may be explained by two factors. First,
the platform used for miRNA expression profiling was
different. We used oligonucleotide probe based Agilent
array that covers all human miRNAs based on miRBase
V16, while the other study used a different system and
the miRBase coverage was not clear. Second, the other
study used relapsed/refractory patient samples whereas
our study used mostly newly diagnosed patient with higher
number of samples. Investigation using standardized
technology and larger patient cohorts may help addressing
the discrepancy observed.
MiR-29b is another established tumor suppressor
miRNA in myeloma.[44-47] The expression of miR29b varies widely in MM, PCL and HMCL with reasons
unclear.[48] We report that miR-29b can be consistently
upregulated by 5’aza. (Supplementary Table S1)
Moreover, increased methylation of mir-29b was observed
in MM patients compared with normal plasma cells, (data
not shown) suggesting that abnormal DNA methylation
may be responsible for lower miR-29b level in subgroup
of MM patients.
In summary, we show that pharmacological reversal
of epigenetic silencing uncovered TS-miRNAs that are
important for the survival and migration of malignant
plasma cells, many for the first time. Furthermore, these
epigenetically silenced TS-miRNA are clinically relevant
as they are hypermethylated and suppressed in patient
samples. Their predicted target genes are known to be
relevant to the biology of myeloma and was found in our
study to be important for prognosis. We acknowledge
that false positives cannot be ruled out for miRNA
targets predicted bioinformatically. Follow-up study on
experimental validation and functional characterization
of predicted miRNA targets is needed to elucidate the

DISCUSSION
Several studies have shown that miRNAs are critical
players in MM. A number of oncogenic and TS-miRNAs
have been identified. For example, miRNA-17 ~ 92 cluster
is overexpressed in MM patients and has oncogenic
properties [14], whereas the silencing of tumor suppressor
miR-194-2-192 miRNA cluster impairs the p53/MDM2
pathway and favors MM development. Epigenetic
silencing, primarily DNA hypermethylation, has been
established as a major cause for the repression of at least
half of the TS-miRNA identified so far in MM, including
miR-34 family, miR-194-2-192 cluster, and miR-203. In
this study, we adopted a systemic approach in identifying
TS-miRNAs epigenetically silenced in MM by treating
MM cells with pharmacological compounds that reverse
the silencing process. We show that hypomethylation
treatment induced consistent upregulation of miRNAs
in 4 HMCLs with distinct genetic background. These
miRNAs include known TS-miRNAs silenced by
hypermethylation, such as miR-192, miR-194 and miR215 (listed in Supplementary Table S8). At the same time,
many other miRNAs were unmasked, including miR125a-3p, miR-155, miR-135a*, miR-198, miR-200c,
miR-188-5p, miR-630, miR-663 and miR-483-5p. These
miRNAs were either downregulated in MM patients,
or had tumor suppressor functions in other cancers as
reported previously. These were therefore selected for
further analysis.
Human myeloma cell lines are mostly representative
of advance disease and those from extramedullary sites.
It is not clear whether these miRNAs were methylated in
newly diagnosed myeloma. Therefore, we investigated
the methylation status of the 9 candidate TS-miRNAs
in 17 clinical myeloma samples consisting of 16 newly
diagnosed and 1 relapsed case, comparing against 5
normal controls. Methylation array revealed DNA
hypermethylation of these candidate TS-miRNAs in
myeloma patients, suggesting that hypermethylation may
contribute to their suppression in the clinical setting.
Methylation of miR-155 is also identified in another recent
study, and higher miR-155 level is associated with longer
survival.[30]
MiR-155 is known to have oncogenic properties
in B cell lymphomas [31] and other cancers.[32, 33] At
the same time, it is also reported that miR-155 acted as
tumor suppressor in cancers such as gastric cancer,[34]
ovarian cancer [35] and melanoma,[36] suggesting that
miR-155 is a multifunctional miRNA depending on cancer
system. Consistent with its context-dependent function,

mechanism of action of TS-miRNAs.
Overall, our study provides further evidence
that many of the deregulated miRNAs in myeloma are
functionally relevant and epigenetic silencing is an
important mechanism mediating their deregulation. This
may have important therapeutic implications in two ways.
One this provides a basis for the utility of epigenetic drugs
in myeloma, both in derepressing epigenetically silenced
tumor suppressor genes but perhaps more importantly
because of the more extensive downstream effect, the
depression of TS-miRNA. Second, with the advent of
miRNA-based therapy, pharmacologic unmasking is an
effective strategy in uncovering tumor suppressor miRNAs
that may be novel therapeutic targets in myeloma.

without RNA degradation or DNA contamination. MiRNA
expression profiling was using Agilent Human MiRNA
Microarray (V16). Each array contained 60-mer probes
representing 1205 human miRNAs from the miRBase
(Version 16.0). Details of experimental procedure and
data analysis were described in supplementary methods.
Complete raw and normalized microarray data and their
MIAME compliant metadata have been deposited at Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under the accession
number GSE53850.

TaqMan miRNA assay
Real-Time RT-PCR quantification of mature
miRNAs were carried out using TaqMan miRNA assay
as previously described [50] using ABI 7300 Real-Time
PCR system. (Applied Biosystems) U6 snRNA were used
for normalization. All experiments were performed in
triplicate. Relative expression was calculated using the
comparative Ct method.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, 5’aza treatment and miRNA
overexpression

Methylation profiling of patient samples

Human MM cell lines H929, MM1S, OPM2
and RPMI-8226 were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM L-glutamine, 100
units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. H929
was supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol at a final
concentration of 50μM. All cells were grown at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. All cells were gifts
from Dr. Leif Bergsagel, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona,
and authenticated before use. 5’azacytidine was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louise, MO, USA) and was
diluted just before use. For miRNA microarray, MM
cells were treated with 5’aza at half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) which was determined with CalcuSyn
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom) as
previously described.[49] IC50 of 5’aza was 2μM for H929
and OPM2, and 1.5μM for MM1S and 8226 cells. Fresh
medium containing 5’aza was added every 24 hours and
cells were harvested at 96 hours after initial treatment. For
miRNA functional study, miRNA mimics and negative
control (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts,
USA) were transfected into MM cells using DharmaFECT
transfection reagent at a final concentration of 100nM.
The efficiency of transfection was validated by TaqMan
miRNA assay.

BM aspirates were obtained from 17 MM cases (16
newly diagnosed and 1 relapsed) with informed consent
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all
studies were approved by National University of Singapore
Institutional Review Board. CD138+ PCs were purified
as described previously.[51] DNA extraction was done
using QIAamp Mini kit (Qiagen). 5 normal control DNA
from CD138+ PCs were provided by Dr. Rafael Fonseca
and Dr. Gregory J Ahmann from Mayo Clinic, Arizona.
DNA methylation data were generated using the Illumina
Infinium Meth450K platform as per manufacturer’s
instructions. Illumina iDat files were imported in Partek
Genomic Suite 6.0 for SWAN normalization[52] and
subsequent analysis. Methylation data was presented as
β values, with 0 indicating 0% DNA methylation and β
values of 1 indicating 100% DNA methylation.

miRNA target prediction
The target genes of the leading candidate TSmiRNAs were predicted using two online databases
miRecords[53] and miRWalk.[54] These two databases
integrated the prediction result of different miRNA
target prediction algorithms including DIANA-microT,
miRanda, PicTar, TargetScan, RNAhybrid, miRDB,
RNA22, PITA, MicroInspector, NBmiRTar, miRWalk and
miTarget. For each miRNA, targets commonly predicted
by at least half of all available algorithms were selected
for further analysis.

RNA extraction and miRNA expression profiling
Total RNA, including small RNAs was extracted
using MiRNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purity
of RNA was assessed by Nanodrop spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and the integrity
was assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Tech,
Palo Alto, CA). All RNA samples showed high quality,

and miR16 at 13q14 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Proc
Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002; 99:15524-15529.

Two-tailed Mann Whitney U test was used to
determine statistical significance between two groups of
categorical variables. Cox regression was used to compare
survival in groups with different risk score (RS) values.
We also used Student’s t-test, when appropriate. P-values
less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistically
significant difference.
