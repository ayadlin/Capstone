ABSTRACT:
Depletion of POLQ (DNA polymerase theta) has recently been shown to render
tumour cells more sensitive to radiotherapy whilst having little or no effect on
normal tissues. This finding led us to investigate whether tumours that overexpress
POLQ are associated with an adverse outcome. We therefore correlated the clinical
outcomes of two retrospective series of patients with early breast cancer with the
expression levels of POLQ, as determined by microarray gene expression analysis.
We found that a significant number of tumours overexpressed POLQ and that
overexpression was correlated with ER negative disease (p=0.047) and high tumour
grade (p=0.004), both of which are associated with poor clinical outcomes. POLQ
overexpression was associated with poor relapse free survival rates on both
univariate (HR 5.80; 95% CI, 2.220 to 15.159; p<0.001) and multivariate analysis
(HR 8.086; 95% CI 2.340 to 27.948 p=0.001). Analysis of other published clinical
series confirmed that POLQ overexpression is associated with adverse clinical
outcomes. The poor prognosis associated with POLQ is independent of other clinical
or pathological features. The mechanism that causes this adverse outcome remains
to be elucidated but may in part arise from resistance to adjuvant treatment. These
findings, combined with the limited normal tissue expression of POLQ, make it a very
appealing target for possible clinical exploitation.

POLQ does not have a significant role in the
hypermutation pathway.
It has been suggested that POLQ has a role in base
excision repair (BER) but this also remains unresolved.
It has previously been shown in the DT40 chicken B
cell lymphoma line, that POLQ/POLβ mutants had
significantly
higher
sensitivity
to
methyl
methanesulfonate than either single mutant. Extracts
obtained from this cell line were used to show that
POLQ mutant cells have markedly reduced single
nucleotide BER capacity in vitro and that this reduction
was of a similar magnitude to cells deficient in POLβ

INTRODUCTION
POLQ (DNA Polymerase Theta) is a member of the
A family of DNA polymerases, which, unusually for
this class of polymerases, synthesizes DNA with very
low fidelity [1, 2]. The precise physiological functions
of this protein are currently unclear. It has previously
been suggested that mice deficient in POLQ had a
substantially decreased frequency of mutations in
immunoglobulin genes [3, 4]. However a recent study
found that mutation types and frequencies were similar
in wild type, POLQ-/-, POLH-/-, and POLQ-/- POLH/- mice [5]. Accordingly this group suggested that

investigations were conducted according to the ethical
standards and principles expressed in the Declaration
of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the
local research ethics committee.

[6]. These findings led to the suggestion that POLQ
and POLβ cooperate in BER.
Recent biochemical analysis has shown that cloned
full-length human POLQ as well as a C-terminal
fragment of POLQ, have 5’-deoxyribose phosphate (5’dRP) lyase activity. The full-length protein and the Cterminal fragment were shown to have BER activity in
vitro [7]. Although these findings have been used to
support the argument that POLQ may have a role in
BER in vivo, it should be noted that the rate of 5’-dRP
lyase activity of POLQ is approximately 40 fold slower
than that of POLβ. Cells with deficiencies in the BER
pathway have been shown to have increased sensitivity
to temozolomide [8]. Since cells depleted of POLQ do
not show hypersensitivity to this drug, it has been
questioned as to whether POLQ has any
physiologically significant role in BER [9].
We have recently published a siRNA screen that
aimed to identify molecular determinants of tumour
radiosensitivity [9]. This study demonstrated that
POLQ siRNA transfection resulted in radiosensitisation
of a panel of tumour cell lines but had little or no effect
on normal tissue lines. These differences reflect
previous work showing significant disparity in
expression between normal tissues and tumour cells
[10]. Normal tissue expression appears to be mainly
limited to lymphoid tissues such as the fetal liver,
thymus, and bone marrow. However POLQ is known
to be overexpressed in a large proportion of tumours
derived from patients with colon, lung, and gastric
cancer.
In view of the in vitro evidence linking POLQ
expression to tumour cell radioresistance, we
hypothesised that POLQ overexpression may increase
the likelihood of treatment failure in cancer patients,
and therefore confer an adverse clinical prognosis.
We therefore correlated the clinical outcomes of
two series of breast cancer patients (n=279 in total)
with the expression levels of POLQ as determined by
microarray gene expression analysis. We also analysed
the pathways associated with POLQ expression in vivo
by data-mining gene expression data from published
breast cancer studies (n=1015 samples). To the best of
our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate that
POLQ is overexpressed in breast cancer, that its
overexpression confers a significant adverse prognosis,
and that it is associated with key cancer pathways.

Patient Details
Individual tumour samples were obtained from
retrospective series of patients with early primary
breast cancer who were treated in Oxford, UK,
between 1989 and 1998. Patients received adjuvant
chemotherapy and/or adjuvant hormone therapy, or no
adjuvant treatment. Tamoxifen was used as endocrine
therapy for 5 years in estrogen receptor (ER) positive
patients. Patients who were 50 years of age, with
lymph node positive tumors, or ER– and/or a primary
tumor >3 cm in diameter, received adjuvant
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil
(CMF) for six cycles, in a three weekly intravenous
regimen. Patients 50 years of age with ER–, lymph
node–positive tumors also received CMF. Two series
of 152 (Series 1) and 127 (Series 2) samples
respectively were analysed. Series 1 has been described
previously [11]; this series had completed 7 years of
follow-up for all but 4 patients, and the median followup time for patients leaving the study alive and without
a relapse was 12 years. Series 2 is part of a published
series [12]; the published cohort had 93 cases in
common with Series 1, these have been excluded from
this study so that Series 1 and 2 have no overlapping
cases. Series 2 had completed 10 year of follow-up
apart from one case. Patient demographic details of
Series 1 and 2 as analysed in this study are summarised
in supplementary table 1.
RNA Extraction and Gene Expression Profiling
Total RNA was isolated by Trizol method
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. mRNA expression was
measured using Affymetrix U133 arrays for Series 1
and Illumina Human RefSeq-8 arrays (Illumina inc.,
San Diego, CA, USA) for Series 2. RNA was amplified
using Ambion Illumina Amplification Kit. Methods for
both protocols have been previously described [12, 13].
Affymetrix data were pre-processed using gcrma [14];
signal from Illumina arrays was background subtracted
with local background subtraction (BeadStudio). Data
from both series were quantile normalized in
Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org) and logged

concordant association with both seeds that was
significantly higher than observed by random
simulation were selected as POLQ co-/inversely
expressed genes. A pathway enrichment analysis was
thus performed using GeneCodis2 [19] to study the

(base 2). The target sequence of the probes that
corresponded to POLQ expression in Affymetrix and
Illumina arrays are shown in supplementary table 2.
Two additional published datasets of patients with
early breast cancer were accessed to validate the
findings observed in the Oxford datasets [15, 16].
Published Clinical Series

Expression
Omnibus
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) was searched for
gene expression studies in cancer, published in peerreviewed journals, where microarrays were performed
on frozen material extracted before treatment with
either chemotherapy, radiotherapy or endocrine
treatment. Five data sets [11, 15, 17] of 1015 samples
in total (supplementary table 3) were selected that used
latest generation Affymetrix 3’ array platforms
(Affymetrix U133 and plus2, www.affymetrix.com).
All handling and processing of the downloaded data
was performed as previously described [18].

Survival Analysis
Endpoints were relapse free survival for Series 1;
and distant-relapse free survival and recurrence free
survival as defined by the STEEP criteria [20] for
Series 2. Endpoints as published were considered for
the other datasets. Univariate and multivariate analysis
was performed. Cox multivariate models were reduced
using stepwise backward likelihood selection. In
univariate analyses, expression of POLQ and other
genes was considered either as binary variable, with
median expression as binary cut-off, or as continuous
variable, ranked and normalised between 0 and 1. In
multivariate analysis the latter was always considered.

Data-mining of Gene Expression Data
Seed-clustering with bootstrap resampling was
applied as previously described [18] to obtain genes
co- and inversely expressed with POLQ in the 1015
published breast cancer samples. In short, the two
probesets targeting POLQ (supplementary table 2)
were chosen as initial seeds. Transcripts on the arrays

RESULTS

POLQ is overexpressed in breast cancer compared
to normal breast tissue

In order to assess POLQ expression, we identified
two independent gene expression datasets that were
obtained using arrays from different manufacturers.
Series 1 and 2 were obtained using Affymetrix and

In order to identify genes which were co-expressed
with POLQ, a seed-clustering analysis was performed
on gene expression data obtained from five different
breast cancer data sets (details of datasets in
supplementary table 3). This identified a total of 97
genes that were strongly associated with POLQ
overexpression in breast cancer (supplementary table
5). Pathway analysis of these genes showed that genes
co-expressed with POLQ are involved in several
pathways that have been associated with cancer
development and progression such as cell cycle
progression, p53 signalling, Wnt signalling and DNA
replication (Fig 3A and 3B).

of the differences in RFS was conducted (Fig 2A).
POLQ overexpression was associated with a markedly
increased risk of disease relapse (HR 5.80; 95% CI,
2.220 to 15.159; p<0.001). We then correlated the
level of POLQ expression with multiple pathological
and demographic features such as patient age, tumour
grade and tumour size. We found that POLQ
overexpression correlated with both ER negative
disease (p=0.047) and high tumour grade (p=0.004)
(Fig 2B). As both of these features are recognised as
being associated with poor clinical outcomes [21-23],
we performed a multivariate analysis which showed
that POLQ expression confers a poor prognosis which
is independent of any other clinical features (HR
8.086; 95% CI 2.340 to 27.948; p=0.001). The
multivariate models contained POLQ as continuous
variable, ranked and normalised between 0 and 1, and
the following clinical features; ER status, lymph node
status, patient age, tumour grade, tumour size. To
confirm the validity of this finding we performed
further univariate and multivariate analyses on Series 2
and the two additional datasets previously described
(supplementary table 4). In total, three of the four
datasets analysed demonstrated that POLQ
overexpression was strongly associated with
significantly worse survival outcomes (Fig 2C).

suggests that the biological mechanisms by which
POLQ and CCNE2 confer a poor prognosis might be
independent of each other. These results could not be
confirmed in the other datasets considered, where
POLQ lost significance after inclusion of CCNE2.
However it should be noted that Series 1 is the only
one in which patients did not receive systemic
chemotherapy which is a potential confounding factor
for prognostic analysis.

previously been shown to be independently associated
with clinical outcome, it is interesting to note that
POLQ is included in both the GGI [25], and the ’76gene’ signature [16]. The correlation between POLQ
expression and tumour grade and prognosis (Fig. 2) led
us to assess whether genes that are co-expressed with
POLQ are included in these validated gene expression
signatures (Fig. 3C). Eighteen of the genes that are
significantly co-expressed with POLQ (supplementary
table 5) are components of the GGI index (Table 1).
The large number of genes that overlap between these
two groups may account for the clinical correlation
between POLQ expression and high tumour grade.

DISCUSSION
We have recently demonstrated that tumour cells
depleted of POLQ are rendered more sensitive to
radiotherapy and that its limited expression in normal
tissues made POLQ a potentially exploitable clinical
target [9]. In this study we have demonstrated that

POLQ overexpression confers a poor prognosis that
is independent of published prognostic signatures

As POLQ has several genes in common with the
GGI signature, and is itself part of the GGI and ‘76
gene’ signatures, we assessed whether POLQ
expression remained an independent predictor of
relapse when these signatures were included in a
multivariate analysis of the data from Series 1 (Fig 4A
and supplementary table 6). POLQ expression
remained a strong, independent predictor of disease
relapse after statistical consideration of these validated
expression profiles and reinforces the close association
between POLQ expression and adverse outcome.

is also co-expressed with POLQ. As cyclin E
overexpression has been identified as being
independently associated with an adverse outcome in
breast cancer patients [26], we considered whether the
adverse prognosis associated with POLQ expression
may simply be due to the observation that CCNE2 is
often co-expressed with POLQ. We therefore
performed a multivariate analysis of the data from
Series 1 that included CCNE2 expression and found
that POLQ and CCNE2 were both independently
associated with an increase in RFS (Fig 4A). It is
notable that tumours that overexpress both POLQ and
CCNE2 confer an extremely poor prognosis relative to
the other groups (HR 3.26; 95% CI 1.88 to 5.66;
p<0.001) (Fig 4B). Tumours that do not overexpress
either gene are associated with a good prognosis, and
those that overexpress only one of the genes are
associated with an intermediate prognosis. This data

POLQ is frequently upregulated in breast cancers.
Although POLQ overexpression has previously been

promotes a more aggressive phenotype, increasing the
likelihood of disease recurrence.
The clinical significance of tumour expression of
POLQ has not previously been examined in detail. A
previous study in colorectal cancer correlated the
expression levels of genes involved in DNA replication
with clinical outcomes in 74 patients with colorectal
cancer [27]. Although POLQ was not independently
associated with adverse outcome, its co-overexpression
with at least three other genes involved in DNA
replication ‘firing’ (from among CDC45, CDC6,
CDT1, SLD5, MCM2, and MCM7) was associated
with a worse overall survival. The overall significance
of POLQ on this finding is not clear since MCM7
overexpression was shown to independently be
associated with adverse survival rates. This group
suggested that the expression of these genes could
produce a more aggressive tumour phenotype by
contributing to ‘replication stress’. As POLQ is known
to repair DNA damage in an error-prone fashion [1, 2],
it would seem likely that the poor prognosis that we
have described in this study is partially due to POLQ
contributing to increased replication stress and
genomic instability.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first study
to demonstrate an adverse association with POLQ

demonstrated in lung, gastric and colorectal cancers
[10], to the best of our knowledge, this has not
previously been shown in breast cancer.
In this current study we have demonstrated strong
associations between POLQ expression and the
presence of other individual factors such as tumour
grade and ER negative disease that are known to confer
an adverse prognosis. We have also demonstrated that
POLQ overexpression is associated with markedly
increased rates of disease relapse, and using
multivariate analysis, that these increased failure rates
are independent of its association with features like
tumour grade and ER status.
The mechanisms by which POLQ overexpression
causes these adverse outcomes are not presently clear.
POLQ associated radioresistance is likely to contribute
to these findings and further work is required to assess
whether POLQ expression increases the tumour cell
resistance to the cytotoxic and endocrine treatments
typically used to treat breast cancers. The coexpression of POLQ with genes linked to pathways
associated with tumour progression, as well as several
genes that are contained within the gene expression
grade index, suggests that POLQ overexpression

expression in patients with breast cancer. In recent
years, attempts have been made to identify gene
expression signatures that are capable of predicting
patient outcomes with greater accuracy than is
currently achievable in routine clinical practice. It is
possible that specific gene expression profiles could
identify the likelihood of response to individual
therapies, enabling clinicians to refine the adjuvant
therapy offered to individual patients. The GGI
signature [25] identified 97 genes with differential
expression between low and high grade breast
carcinomas. This signature enabled a more accurate
and refined assessment of the risk of disease recurrence
in patients with intermediate grade disease. Subsequent
studies have confirmed the ability of the GGI signature
to accurately predict disease relapse [13, 28]. A
separate expression profile has been created to more
accurately identify patients at risk of developing
metastatic disease [16]. This study used tumours
derived from patients who did not receive adjuvant
systemic therapy, thereby eliminating potentially
confounding predictive factors occurring as a result of
systemic treatment. The resulting ‘76 gene’ signature
was shown to predict both distant failure as well as
overall survival. Further studies have reinforced the
prognostic accuracy of this gene signature [29, 30]. A
third gene expression profile utilising a 70 gene
signature has also been shown to predict clinical
outcome [24] and has also been subsequently validated
[31]. The prognostic effect of POLQ expression on its
own has not previously been assessed, but it is
interesting to note that POLQ is a component of both
the GGI and the ’76 gene’ expression profiles. Given
the large differences that we have shown in relapse
rates on the basis of POLQ expression, and that these
differences are maintained on multivariate analyses
that include these signatures, it is possible that POLQ
may be amongst the most important determinants
within these signatures.
Pathway analysis identified several genes,
including Cyclin E, that were frequently co-expressed
with POLQ. Cyclin E over expression has been
identified as being associated with an adverse outcome
in breast cancer patients [26]. It is the only gene that is
a component of all three gene expression signatures
and which is also frequently co-expressed with POLQ.
Cyclin E binds to cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (cdk-2),
permitting the transition from G1 to S-phase [32].
Increased cyclin E induces enhanced cdk-2 activity,
accelerating G1/S transition [33]. There is substantial
evidence to suggest that CCNE overexpression confers

a poor prognosis in breast cancer. A recent metaanalysis of 12 independent studies involving 2,534
patients, demonstrated that the combined HR estimate
for overall survival and breast cancer specific survival
was 2.98 (95% CI, 1.85–4.78) and 2.86 (95% CI, 1.85–
4.41) in univariate and multivariate analysis,
respectively [34]. Although there is ongoing debate as
to which fragments of cyclin E are important in
predicting outcome [35], the evidence supporting its
use in routine clinical assessment have led for calls for
large scale clinical trials [34]. In this study we have
again confirmed that cyclin E overexpression was
associated with a poor clinical prognosis on
multivariate analysis. In addition we have shown that
tumours expressing both POLQ and CCNE2 are
associated with an extremely poor outcome. This
suggests that these genes confer a poor prognosis
through separate mechanisms. Larger studies are
required to investigate whether the risk of relapse from
tumours overexpressing cyclin E could be better
assessed if further stratified by POLQ expression
levels.
Independently of its association with other known
poor pathological features, POLQ overexpression is
associated with increased relapse rates. This is the first
study to demonstrate that POLQ overexpression is
associated with an extremely poor outcome in breast
cancer on both univariate and multivariate analysis.
We believe that the poor prognosis associated with
POLQ expression, the known radiosensitivity induced
by its depletion, and its highly limited normal tissue
expression makes POLQ an extremely appealing target
for clinical exploitation.
