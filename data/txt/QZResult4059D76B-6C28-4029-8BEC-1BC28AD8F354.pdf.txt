Abstract
Slow-clearing, tumor-targeting proteins such as monoclonal antibodies typically exhibit high tumor accumulation but low tissue contrast, whereas intermediate-sized proteins such as scFvs show faster clearance but
only moderate tumor accumulation. For both, tumor targeting does not seem to improve further above an
optimal affinity. We show here that with very small high-affinity proteins such as designed ankyrin repeat
proteins (DARPins), these limits can be overcome. We have systematically investigated the influence of molecular mass and affinity on tumor accumulation with DARPins with specificity for HER2 in SK-OV-3.ip nude
mouse xenografts. DARPins with a mass of 14.5 kDa and affinities between 270 nmol/L and 90 pmol/L showed
a strong correlation of tumor accumulation with affinity to HER2, with the highest affinity DARPin reaching
8% ID/g after 24 hours and 6.5% ID/g after 48 hours (tumor-to-blood ratio >60). Tumor autoradiographs
showed good penetration throughout the tumor mass. Genetic fusion of two DARPins (30 kDa) resulted in
significantly lower tumor accumulation, similar to values observed for scFvs, whereas valency had no influence
on accumulation. PEGylation of the DARPins increased the circulation half-life, leading to higher tumor accumulation (13.4% ID/g after 24 hours) but lower tumor-to-blood ratios. Affinity was less important for tumor
uptake of the PEGylated constructs. We conclude that two regimes exist for delivering high levels of drug to a
tumor: small proteins with very high affinity, such as unmodified DARPins, and large proteins with extended
half-life, such as PEGylated DARPins, in which the importance of affinity is less pronounced. Cancer Res; 70(4);

Introduction
Therapeutic antibodies have been used in recent years for
the targeting of solid tumors (1–3) to overcome the lack of
specificity of classic anticancer drugs. Even though human
antibodies are now available through a variety of technologies (4), the clinical efficacy of even some marketed antitumor antibodies is limited (5, 6), suggesting that additional
effector mechanisms will be needed (1, 7). This argues for
the construction of novel robust targeting molecules which
can be engineered for enhanced efficacy, e.g., by facile linkage
to additional effector molecules. For any effector function
that could exert toxicity on normal cells, high tumor locali-

zation of the targeting molecule and sufficiently rapid elimination from healthy tissue is pivotal.
Tumor targeting proteins seem to be caught between two
constraints. Slow-clearing, tumor-targeting proteins such as
monoclonal antibodies with long half-lives typically exhibit
high tumor accumulation but low tissue contrast (8). Intermediate-sized proteins such as scFvs show faster clearance
but only moderate tumor accumulation (9, 10). It has been
suggested that very high affinities might not be beneficial
for increased targeting in either case (11, 12).
We show here that with very small high-affinity proteins
such as designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), these
limits can be overcome, and we present a systematic approach that establishes the observed tumor accumulation
and targeting contrast as a function of affinity, targeting
molecule size, and pharmacokinetics.
HER2-overexpressing breast tumors are well studied and
thus represent a suitable reference point for evaluating
alternative binding molecules in tumor localization studies.
The overexpression of HER2 is correlated with an aggressive
tumor phenotype (13) and it occurs in a broad range of human cancers, notably breast and ovarian cancers (14, 15).
HER2 is a 185 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein receptor
tyrosine kinase of the family of human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER; refs. 16, 17). It plays a key role in HER
ligand–dependent tumor growth and could form different

types of heterodimers with other family members, notably
HER3 (16, 18).
Recently, we have developed combinatorial libraries of a
new class of small proteins, termed “designed ankyrin repeat
proteins” (19, 20) that can act as an alternative to antibodies,
as they are particularly robust to engineering. They are based
on a very different structure (Supplementary Fig. S1) and are
built from consecutive 33-amino acid repeats, each forming a
β-turn followed by two antiparallel α-helices. In each repeat,
seven residues were randomized, and these internal repeats
are flanked by constant capping repeats, to give one contiguous polypeptide chain with a randomized binding surface.
The proteins contain no cysteine, can be expressed in soluble
form in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli at very high levels,
and are very stable and resistant to aggregation (ref. 21 and
references therein). By attaching a polyethylene glycol (PEG)
molecule (22), the hydrodynamic radius of DARPins can be
optionally increased dramatically, thus altering the pharmacokinetic profile of the DARPin to a longer half-life. DARPins
can also easily be engineered in the form of homodimers and
heterodimers, trimers, or even higher multimers (Supplementary Fig. S1), as well as in the form of other fusion proteins, all in soluble form and with the same high yield from
E. coli.4
High-affinity binders against a wide variety of targets and
in particular HER2-specific DARPins have previously been selected from our DARPin libraries both by ribosome and
phage display (23–25). From this latter work, we have isolated point mutants of a specific anti-HER2 DARPin (molecular
weight, 14.5 kDa) showing affinities between 90 pmol/L and
270 nmol/L. Here, we use these DARPins in tumor-targeting
experiments, showing that unmodified high-affinity DARPins,
having a very fast clearance, reach high values of tumor accumulation for an extended time with high tumor-to-blood
ratios, paralleled by high tumor-to-tissue ratios (except
in the liver and kidney, which are involved in excretion).
Tumor accumulation correlates with the affinity of these
DARPins, without reaching a plateau. With PEG-ylation of
the DARPins, even higher tumor accumulation could be
achieved, but the slower clearance reduces the tumor-toblood ratio, and the importance of affinity is significantly less
pronounced.
We discuss these results in view of previous studies with
antibody fragments of different formats, and also compare
them with DARPin constructs engineered to a similar size
as scFv fragments.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification. All details are described in the Supplementary Methods and Figs. S2 to S4.
Briefly, all DARPin constructs were expressed in E. coli
XL1-Blue and purified essentially as previously described
(24). For PEGylation of the DARPins, a cysteine was intro-

duced at the penultimate position and the protein was allowed to react with maleimide-PEG of 20, 40, or 60 kDa.
The scFv fragment 4D5 was expressed and purified in E. coli
SB536 as previously described (26). HER2 (first 631 amino
acids of the mature protein) was kindly provided by
Dr. Tim Adams and coworkers (CSIRO, Melbourne, Australia).
His-tag–specific 99mTc-labeling of the DARPins. The radioactive labeling of the DARPins with 99mTc(CO)3 at the
His-tag was performed essentially as previously described
(ref. 27; Supplementary Methods).
Tumor cell lines. For all biodistribution studies, the human
ovarian carcinoma cell line SK-OV-3.ip was used (kindly
provided by Ellen Vitetta, University of Texas, Dallas, TX).
For some cell binding experiments and control biodistribution
studies, SK-OV-3 (HTB-77; European Collection of Animal
Cell Cultures, Salisbury, United Kingdom) and BT474-cells
(HTB-20) were also used where indicated.
Affinity-determination of DARPins on human BT474
tumor cells. DARPin-superfolder-GFP fusions were constructed and binding to cells was measured by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting by following the on-rate and the off-rate
and calculating KD as their ratio (Supplementary Figs. S5-S6).
To minimize internalization, cells were preincubated with
0.2% NaN3 for 30 min at 37°C. To minimize rebinding during
the dissociation phase, a large excess (50 nmol/L) of unlabeled
DARPin G3 was added as competitor.
Biodistribution studies of DARPins. Female CD1-FOXn1/
nu mice (Charles River), 6 to 8 wk old, were engrafted with
human SK-OV-3.ip tumor cells subcutaneously injected at
the lateral flanks (106 cells, mixed with BD Matrigel Matrix
HC; BD Biosciences). The studies were started 2 to 3 wk
after tumor inoculation, when the tumors had reached a
size of 50 to 300 mg. Each mouse received a single dose
of 8 to 10 μg of 99m Tc(CO) 3 -labeled DARPin variant
(37 MBq/mouse) intravenously, administered in 100 μL. Mice
(n = 3 per time point and construct) were sacrificed after 1, 4,
24, 48, and 72 h after injection, organs were removed and
the accumulated radioactivity was measured in a gammascintillation counter (Supplementary Methods).
Tumor autoradiography. Twenty-four hours after 10 μg
(37 MBq) of the 99mTc(CO)3-labeled DARPin variant injection, the SK-OV-3.ip tumors (0.5 cm diameter) were cut into
three layers (rim, middle section, rim). The slices were put on
a Kodak X-Omat Blue film for 4 h and also analyzed with a
Packard InstantImager.
Single photon emission computed tomography imaging
studies. Single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) imaging experiments were performed with an
X-SPECT system (Gamma Medica, Inc.) with a single head
SPECT device and a computed tomography (CT) device,
24 h after injection of the 99mTc(CO)3-labeled DARPin. The
DARPin (370–555 MBq/200 μL = 10–15 mCi/200 μL) was administered via a lateral tail vein (further details in the Supplementary Methods).
For high-resolution images, tumors were scanned with a
pinhole collimator (tungsten-based collimator, 1 mm diameter). The SPECT field of view was reduced to 30 × 30 mm and
the acquisition time was increased to 4 h.

Influence of DARPin Affinity and Size on Tumor Targeting

Results
Constructs and labeling. In this study, we investigated
how efficiently DARPins could be enriched at a tumor site,
and determined their biodistribution as a function of affinity and hydrodynamic size. We used a previously described
DARPin specific for HER2, i.e., H10-2-G3 (24), or G3 in
short. It has a molecular weight of 14.5 kDa and consists of
an NH2-terminal capping repeat, two internal repeats carrying
the binding residues, and a COOH-terminal capping repeat
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Being derived from an affinity maturation experiment, we could construct the presumed progenitor and its evolutionary intermediates. We therefore had at
our disposal DARPins binding to the same epitope on HER2,
with affinities ranging from 90 pmol/L to 270 nmol/L. They
are named by indicating the amino acid(s) exchanged in G3
(ref. 24; Supplementary Fig. S1).
We expressed these DARPins in E. coli and purified them
as described (19, 20). They were monomeric on gel filtration
(Supplementary Fig. S2) and were labeled with 99mTc(CO)3 on
the NH2-terminal His-tag (27).
The proteins were also derivatized with PEG of different
sizes (20–60 kDa) at a unique engineered COOH-terminal
cysteine (Supplementary Figs. S3-S4). The PEG20-containing
proteins eluted at an apparent molecular weight of >300 kDa,
consistent with the well-known effect of PEG20 of greatly increasing the hydrodynamic radius (26, 28). PEGylation had
previously been shown to have no effect on the off-rate
and only a small effect on the on-rate (28). These PEGylated
proteins were 99mTc-labeled in the same way (27).
For a direct comparison to single-chain Fv fragments, we
created DARPins with similar molecular weight as scFvs
(∼25 kDa): the DARPin G3 was linked via a flexible linker
to a nonbinding DARPin, E2_5 (20), or alternatively, to anoth-

er DARPin G3 to create a bivalent DARPin (Supplementary
Fig. S1). These constructs, denoted G3-E2_5 and G3-G3, were
expressed, purified, and 99mTc-labeled as described above.
The stability of the DARPins was tested in PBS and serum.
Even after 4 weeks at 37°C, no aggregation, degradation or
loss of binding was detected (Supplementary Figs. S7-S10).
Affinities on cells. Previously reported affinities had been
measured on purified HER2 by surface plasmon resonance
(24). Because the epitope recognized by G3 is on domain-4,
proximal to the membrane (17), and because the measured
affinity of the monovalent trastuzumab scFv or Fab fragment
(also binding to domain-4) is significantly different between
purified HER2 and whole cells (28–30), we measured the affinity of the DARPins to whole cells (Supplementary Figs. S5-S6).
We used the mean fluorescence intensity of DARPin-GFP
fusions measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to
determine both on- and off-rates on BT474-cells (Supplementary Figs. S5-S6) under conditions in which receptor internalization is minimized, and from this, we calculated the
functional affinity. This approach can be used over a wide
range of affinities and allows accurate comparisons even
though an effect of GFP cannot strictly be excluded.
The values obtained very closely match those determined
with the pure HER2 by surface plasmon resonance (Table 1),
with only G3-D showing an ∼3-fold slower off-rate on cells.
Because the on-rates of the G3 mutants on cells are very similar to each other, affinities on cells are directly determined
by off-rates on cells.
The best binder, G3, has an affinity of ∼60 to 100 pmol/L
also on cells. The epitope on domain-4 of HER2, recognized
by the G3-derived DARPins, may thus be better accessible
than the one recognized by trastuzumab.
The bivalent DARPin G3-G3 shows a similar on-rate as
the monovalent DARPins, but its off-rate is too small to be

measured (<1 × 10−6 s−1; Supplementary Fig. S5), which directly
shows bivalent binding on cells. As a control, we also
measured G3-E2_5 (data not shown), and its dissociation
rate matches that of G3, as expected from its single HER2binding site.
Blood clearance in healthy BALB/c mice. For the unmodified DARPin G3, at 7.5 minutes, 90% of the radioactivity had
already disappeared from the blood (Fig. 1A), suggesting a
half-life of <3 minutes in which both tissue distribution
and clearance through the kidney occurs. There may be an
additional slow phase with only 5% amplitude and a half-life
of 80 to 90 minutes (Fig. 1A). The bivalent DARPins are
cleared almost as rapidly as well (Fig. 1A), suggesting, to a
large extent, first-pass clearance for these small DARPins.

The serum clearance of PEGylated DARPins shows two
slow phases. The initial phase (∼1 day) might suggest a tissue distribution phase, before the even slower terminal plasma elimination (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Tables ST4 and ST5).
The slowest phase correlates with the size of the PEG molecule (PEG20, ∼19 hours; PEG40 and PEG60, ∼50 hours).
Therefore, as with many other PEGylated proteins, the terminal half-life is mostly determined by the hydrodynamics of
the PEG molecule, preventing glomerular filtration and reducing the apparent volume of distribution at early times
(see Discussion).
Tumor localization of unmodified DARPins. The targe‐
ting properties of the various constructs were examined
in nude mice xenografted with human ovarian carcinoma
SK-OV-3.ip cells, subcutaneously injected at the lateral
flanks. Control experiments showed no significant differences with SK-OV-3 tumors (Supplementary Table ST1).
We first compared the biodistribution of 14.5 kDa DARPins after 1, 4, 24, and 48 hours (Fig. 2A, Table 2). Their
half-life was very short, consistent with the measurements
in BALB/c mice with shorter time points (Fig. 1A). Nonetheless, high tumor localization values were observed, ∼8% ID/g
for the construct with the highest affinity after 4 hours. Even
after 48 hours, this value was still ∼6.5% ID/g.
Because of the very low blood levels even after only
4 hours, very high tumor-to-blood values were reached (30 after 4 hours, >60 at 24 hours and beyond). The tissue distribution
of the unmodified DARPin G3 was measured in eight different
experimental series, all falling within 1 SD from the mean
(Fig. 2A).
For the other unmodified DARPins with lower affinity
(Table 1), tumor accumulation was lower, and proportional
to affinity (Fig. 2A; Table 2). There was no indication of a
leveling-off at high affinity, an effect which has been observed
with bigger targeting reagents (refs. 11, 12; see Discussion).
The control DARPin E3_5 (20) with no affinity to HER2
was also tested (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Table ST1), and after
24 hours, only 0.46% ID/g was located at the tumor, showing
that localization depends on specific binding to HER2.
Tumor localization of DARPin-linker-DARPin constructs.
Both the bivalent G3-G3 construct, and a monovalent G3E2_5 construct, in which the second DARPin had no affinity
with HER2, were investigated. In both cases, the amount
observed at the tumor was lower than for the monovalent
G3 (Fig. 2C; time course in Supplementary Table ST2).
Because G3-G3 and G3-E2_5 show essentially the same tumor uptake (Supplementary Table ST2), the higher avidity
of G3-G3 seems to neither contribute to additional tumor
retention nor could an additional barrier effect explain the
lower tumor accumulation. Instead, we propose this lower
accumulation to be an effect of the higher molecular weight
(see Discussion).
Tumor localization of PEGylated DARPins. Cys-containing
derivatives were made, giving equally high yields in production as their parent molecules, and coupling of PEG20 was
almost quantitative. Tumor accumulation for G3-PEG20 after 24 hours reaches 13.4% ID/g (Fig. 2B; Table 2; Supplementary Table ST3) and shows much slower tumor accumulation.

Influence of DARPin Affinity and Size on Tumor Targeting

Tumor values stay very high throughout the experiment
(Supplementary Tables ST3 and ST6). This slow accumulation
suggests that the protein in the blood acts as a reservoir from
which slow extravasation to the tumor occurs over a long
duration. The slow off-rates from HER2 allow a slow but
steady build-up.
The second difference to the non-PEGylated proteins is
that tumor accumulation seems to depend less on affinity
than for the non-PEGylated DARPins (Fig. 2B). Only the
lowest-affinity binder (KD = 270 nmol/L) is just slightly
above the background of a nonbinding control (see above),
illustrating that tumor enrichment is dependent on specific
binding to HER2. Due to the slower blood clearance, the
tumor-to-blood ratios at early times are much smaller, and
the highest values (∼20) are only reached after 72 hours
(Supplementary Table ST6).
We also compared the tumor accumulation of DARPin G3,
coupled to PEG20 and PEG60 (Supplementary Table ST3).
The PEG60 construct seemed to be retained slightly more
at the tumor site after 48 hours, suggesting a role of the
serum reservoir in an extended tumor loading phase.
Organ distribution. The distribution to liver and kidney
gives information about the preferred elimination pathway
of the DARPins. As expected, the small DARPins are eliminated predominantly via the kidney. 99mTc(CO)3 is a residualizing labeling reagent which remains in the kidney cells
following endocytosis (31, 32) due to the high stability of
the 99mTc label at the His-tag of the proteins (27) and the
inability of the cell to excrete this label. High kidney values
are observed for all monovalent DARPins (Table 2), as for
scFv fragments (27, 31, 32) and camel VHH domains (33).
For the constructs with two linked DARPins, predominant
elimination via the kidney is seen as well, but the values
are somewhat lower and the liver values correspondingly
slightly higher (Supplementary Table ST2), even though this
is not reflected in a significantly longer serum half-life.
The PEGylated proteins gave rise to a much lower percentage of label found in the kidney (Table 2). As expected from
similar studies with PEGylated antibody fragments (10, 26),
PEGylated DARPins are thus eliminated to a greater extent
via the liver.
Organ distribution in healthy BALB/c mice. After
24 hours, similar values for kidney accumulation and only
low liver accumulation were found as in tumor-bearing nude

NOTE: Biodistributions of unmodified and PEGylated DARPins and with different affinity were analyzed in nude mice, xenografted
with human ovarian carcinoma SK-OV-3.ip tumors. Mice (n = 3 per time point) were sacrificed and organs excised at the times
indicated after injection of the 99mTc(CO)3-labeled constructs. Data are given as the percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue
(% ID/g) and expressed as the mean ± SD.

mice (Supplementary Tables ST4–ST5). The same correspondence between BALB/c mice and tumor-bearing nude mice
was found for the biodistribution of G3-PEG20 derivatives,
showing that the nude mice phenotype has no influence on
the biodistribution of DARPins.
Imaging the distribution of radioactivity within the
tumor. We investigated the penetration of the highest affinity DARPin G3 by imaging slices of a SK-OV-3.ip tumor 24
hours after injection, using both X-ray film (Fig. 3A and B)
and a Packard InstantImager (Fig. 3C and D). Clearly, the
protein penetrates the whole tumor mass quite evenly, with
a potentially slightly stronger staining near the rim of the
tumor, which might have been expected for high-affinity
molecules (see Discussion).
SPECT/CT imaging studies. A whole-body SPECT/CT of a
mouse bearing tumors left and right of the shoulders was
performed with 99mTc(CO)3-labeled G3 (Fig. 4A) 24 hours after i.v. injection and compared with a scan of a mouse injected with 99m Tc(CO) 3 -labeled G3-PEG20 (Fig. 4B). For
both DARPins, high accumulation of radioactivity was detected in tumors localized on both shoulders. Significantly
less accumulation of radioactivity was found in the kidneys
of the mouse injected with the PEGylated DARPin.
A high-resolution SPECT/CT image (Fig. 4C) of a SK-OV-3.ip
tumor on the right hind leg, 24 hours after targeting with
DARPin G3, showed accumulation of the radioactivity in the
tumor with some preferential detection at the rim. Because
the field of view in this study is reduced to 30 × 30 mm,
the nonspecific accumulation in nontargeted organs such as
the kidney is not visible.

Discussion
The four goals of this study were to (a) quantitatively test
the ability of DARPins to target to tumors in mice, (b) exam-

www.aacrjournals.org

ine the optimal DARPin tumor targeting format, (c) evaluate
the dependence of targeting on DARPin affinity, and (d) examine the relationship between size, valency, and affinities
for the most effective tumor targeting, and to derive general
principles for targeting molecules by comparing the results
with other reports on targeting HER2.
We will argue in the following that the favorable uptake
values of unmodified DARPins are a combination of high
affinity and small size, which allows efficient extravasation
and retention at the tumor. These targeting properties also
capitalize on the lack of aggregation of DARPins (refs. 19,
21, 34; Supplementary Figs. S7–S10). Biophysical stability
has been previously shown to directly improve tumor
targeting (35).
Higher tumor accumulation values can be reached by IgGs
by virtue of their FcRn-mediated long serum half-life (36), but
with a correspondingly long tissue half-life and more limited
tumor penetration.
Influence of affinities on unmodified DARPins. The total
amount located at the tumor is directly proportional to
affinity, and there is no leveling off with affinity (Fig. 2A).
This was found over the whole time range measured. The
serum half-life seems to be, as expected, comparable
for the DARPin point mutants investigated, and thus these
higher tumor enrichments also parallel higher tumor-toblood ratios, proportional to affinity. Because the on-rates
are very similar among the DARPins, both on cells and on
pure proteins (Table 1; except for the binder with the
lowest affinity; ref. 24), total build-up and retention at the
tumor seems to be governed by the dissociation rates from
the target.
DARPin constructs with additional domains. The bivalent molecule did not show improved targeting over the monomeric one, but instead lower accumulation, despite its
extremely slow off-rate, in turn demonstrating that binding

particles, termed enhanced permeability and retention
(39, 40). However, because the PEGylated variant with
KD = 270 nmol/L (Fig. 2B) showed almost no tumor accumulation, we can conclude that specific binding with reasonable
affinity is essential and the enhanced permeability and retention effect is insignificant.
PEGylated monomeric and dimeric scFv constructs
showed similar tumor accumulation (26) as PEGylated DARPins, and thus, it is largely determined by hydrodynamic
properties of the PEG. However, because of their robustness
and the unique cysteine, PEGylated DARPins are easier to
prepare.
Comparison to antibody scFv fragments. We restrict our
discussion to targeting studies of HER2 in SK-OV-3 tumors,
and where the affinity on cells has been measured, because to
pure antigen, it is potentially different (28–30). With the scFv
4D5 (refs. 10, 26; KD = 9–29 nmol/L on cells), tumor accumulations of 1% to 1.77% ID/g were obtained after 24 hours.

with 99mTc(CO)3-labeled DARPin G3, 24 h after i.v. injection. The slices
were put on Kodak X-Omat Blue film and exposed for 4 h (A, rim;
B, middle section). The radioactivity was also recorded with a Packard
InstantImager (C, rim; D, middle section).

on cells is really bivalent. Tumor accumulation was equally
low for a two-domain DARPin with only one functional site.
This suggests that the lower accumulation was governed by
molecular size, and not by a barrier effect of this highavidity construct. For both DARPin-DARPin fusions (molecular weight, 30 kDa), tumor accumulations (<2% ID/g)
were very similar to those of monovalent anti-HER2 scFv
fragments (molecular weight 25 kDa) with affinities on
cells of 1 to 320 nmol/L in similar SK-OV-3 models (9, 10,
26, 37, 38).
The influence of PEGylation. The depot function of the
PEGylated molecules in serum, evidenced by their prolonged terminal half-life (∼19 hours), probably coupled with
slow extravasation and diffusion, leads to a slower build-up
on the tumor, and limits the achievable tumor-to-blood
ratios.
The importance of affinity for the extent of tumor accumulation is diminished for the PEGylated constructs, compared
with the underivatized constructs. Similarly, for whole antibodies, affinity did not seem to increase total tumor accumulation above a certain threshold affinity (11).
A pure physical effect has been proposed to contribute
to the tumor uptake of large macromolecules and nano-

Influence of DARPin Affinity and Size on Tumor Targeting

The scFv C6.5 (KD = 70 nmol/L on cells) was evolved to KD =
3.8 nmol/L, however, only marginally changing tumor
accumulation from 1.32% to 1.42% ID/g (41), or from 0.80%
to 1.48% ID/g (38). The nanomolar KD of these monovalent
scFv on cells, compared with the picomolar DARPin, might
contribute to the lower accumulation observed.
scFv fragments have been converted to bivalent and tetravalent miniantibodies by fusing self-assembling peptides to
the COOH terminus (10, 26), but tumor accumulation was
only moderately increased to 2.84% ID/g for the tetramer.
A 135 kDa trivalent molecule, made via barnase-barstar fusions and being above the renal filtration threshold, showed
a higher increase (7.04% ID/g; ref. 42) and a longer terminal
half-life.
When the scFv fragment C6.5 and its high-affinity derivative were converted to diabodies (functional affinity on
cells 3.4 and 0.49 nmol/L, respectively), 6.48% and 3.18%
ID/g were reported. Note that the higher avidity molecule
performed worse (41). The evolved monovalent C6.5 scFv
(KD = 3.8 nmol/L on cells) only lead to 1.42% ID/g on the
tumor. Size does not seem to be the crucial difference, however, because a monovalent scFv and the corresponding diabody with only one functional site showed the same tumor
accumulation (37). A more efficient internalization of the
particular bivalent diabody might lead to a better retention
of label, even at a similar functional affinity.
In mice with kidneys removed (12, 38), tumor accumulation of all fragments was increased. In this artificial
model, no further increase in tumor accumulation was
found beyond a functional affinity of ∼10−9 mol/L, with
even a drop for one data point at 10−11 mol/L. The highaffinity molecules predominantly localized at the periphery of the tumor, whereas the low-affinity molecules—at
the same total dose—localized diffusely throughout the
tumor.
This peripheral location is consistent with the “shrinking
core model” (8, 43), in which antigens are occupied starting
from the tumor outside and progressing to the inside. Every
antigen encountered is occupied and remains so, if the offrate is low, whereas the molecules dissociate and transiently
rebind further inward (but also leave the tumor), if the offrate is faster. This concept has been originally proposed for
whole antibodies in similar form (11).
Taken together, these studies with scFv monomers and
multimers have found increased tumor accumulation with
increasing valency, and in some cases, functional affinity.
The extent, however, varied significantly between constructs.
Higher molecular weight is favorable only if it brings the molecule above the renal filtration threshold by increasing the
terminal half-life. Nonetheless, the data have also suggested
that an increase in functional affinity beyond a certain
threshold is not useful for molecules the size of an scFv
and its multimers. We show here that some of these limitations are not found for smaller high-affinity molecules such
as DARPins.
Comparison to other scaffolds targeting HER2. Affibodies and other small scaffolds have also been selected to bind
to HER2 (44), and one such molecule with KD = 50 nmol/L

www.aacrjournals.org

has been affinity-matured to 22 pmol/L (measured on purified HER2). To our knowledge, the affinity on whole cells has
not been reported. The evolved affibody showed tumor uptakes reaching 8.6% ID/g after 24 hours (45).
The original monovalent affibody (KD = 50 nmol/L) was
also made bivalent (functional affinity ∼3 nmol/L), but bivalent binding on cells was not tested. The tumor uptake was
2.6% ID/g after 12 hours (46), significantly less than for the
evolved monomer, with the caveat that the labeling method
was not always the same.
Tumor localization of single-domain antibodies directed
against HER2 has not been reported. Two camel VHH domains, specific for epidermal growth factor receptor (KD =
2.3 and 5.7 nmol/L in vitro), were reported with tumor uptakes of 9.1% ID/g and 6.1% ID/g, measured 1.5 hours after
injection (33).
Taken together, these results support our hypothesis that
predicts favorable targeting properties for molecules which
combine high affinity with small molecular size.
The importance of molecular weight. The molecular
weight influences at least three parameters critical for targeting (a) capillary extravasation, (b) diffusion, and (c) renal
clearance (8, 36).
There may be a rather steep dependence of tumor vascular
permeability on molecular weight (47), with smaller molecules showing significantly greater permeability, even in tumor capillaries. This has been well known for normal
capillaries (48). For proteins with a Stokes-Einstein radius
of 40 Å, only very low levels are found outside the plasma,
whereas proteins of 20 Å almost completely equilibrate with
interstitial fluid or lymph. DARPins would probably behave
like the latter (49), and because of the measured steep molecular weight dependence, have significantly higher permeability than scFv fragments and other larger constructs. In
earlier work, permeability varied only 2-fold for substances
between 25 and 160 kDa (scFv to full IgG; ref. 50), but recent
work suggests much stronger trends when extending studies
to smaller molecular weights (47). The capillary permeability
may be the limiting parameter controlling the flow of antibodies reaching the tumor (8).
Because of the lack of lymphatic drainage in a tumor,
proteins are moving from the capillary to the tumor center
by diffusion, with negligible convection (8). The diffusion coefficient of an scFv and a PEGylated scFv differs only by a
factor of 2 (28), and the differences between DARPin and
scFv would be smaller still. Nonetheless, hindered diffusion through tumor interstitial space might augment this
difference.
The underivatized DARPins are cleared through the kidney, giving rise to a rather short serum half-life and an observable accumulation of radioactivity in the kidney, very
similar to scFv fragments or camelid VHH domains (see
above).
An increase in molecular weight seems to be beneficial for
tumor uptake only once the molecule is brought above the
renal filtration cutoff (42). The addition of a nonfunctional
binding site is neither beneficial for scFvs (37) nor DARPins
(see above).

Zahnd et al.

There are two modes of efficient targeting. Our conclusions are consistent with a mathematical model (36)
published after the submission of this article. First, DARPins
and presumably other small, very soluble proteins with picomolar affinity, also show high tumor accumulation with very
fast clearance through the liver and kidney. This is probably
due to high extravasation and tumor penetration, and requires
a very slow off-rate from the target, leading to efficient tumor
retention. Targeting is proportional to affinity and no plateau
with affinity was seen, suggesting that still higher affinities
might further increase tumor targeting.
Second, very large proteins such as monoclonal antibodies
or PEGylated DARPins achieve even higher tumor loads due
the long circulation and (slow) equilibration with the tumor,
but the elimination from blood and nontumor tissue is also
slow, and tumor-to-tissue ratios remain lower.
Intermediate size molecules (fused DARPins, scFv
fragments) show lower tumor accumulation because elimination through the kidney is equally rapid, but extravasation, and perhaps tumor diffusion, is diminished. The very
tight binding of a bivalent DARPin does not compensate
this effect.
