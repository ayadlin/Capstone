ABSTRACT
The ROS1 tyrosine kinase is activated in lung cancer as a consequence of
chromosomal rearrangement. Although high response rates and disease control have
been observed in lung cancer patients bearing rearranged ROS1 tumors (ROS1+)
treated with the kinase inhibitor crizotinib, many of these patients eventually relapse.
To identify mechanisms of resistance to ROS1 inhibitors we generated resistant
cells from HCC78 lung cancer cells bearing the SLC34A2-ROS1 rearrangement. We
found that activation of the RAS pathway in the HCC78 cell model, due to either
KRAS/NRAS mutations or to KRAS amplification, rendered the cells resistant to ROS1
inhibition. These cells were cross-resistant to different ROS1 inhibitors, but sensitive
to inhibitors of the RAS signaling pathway. Interestingly, we identified focal KRAS
amplification in a biopsy of a tumor from a patient that had become resistant to
crizotinib treatment.
Altogether our data suggest that the activation of members of the RAS family
can confer resistance to ROS1 inhibitors. This has important clinical implications as:
(i) RAS genetic alterations in ROS1+ primary tumors are likely negative predictors of
efficacy for targeted drugs and (ii) this kind of resistance is unlikely to be overcome
by the use of more specific or more potent ROS1 targeting drugs.

INTRODUCTION

prognoses, with a 5% 5-year survival rate [2].
The treatment and diagnosis of NSCLC has been
revolutionized by the development of targeted agents
for cancers harboring specific cancer promoting genetic
alterations. Thus, routine genetic testing for somatic
mutations/rearrangements from NSCLC biopsies is
becoming the standard for providing optimal patient care.
The identification of oncogenic mutations in receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as EGFR [3, 4] and, less
commonly, rearrangement of ALK, RET and ROS1 in

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer
related death, with about 1.6 million cases diagnosed
yearly worldwide, resulting in 1.4 million deaths [1].
Approximately 85% of lung cancer cases are nonsmall-cell lung cancers (NSCLC), most commonly
adenocarcinomas or squamous-cell carcinomas. Early
stage NSCLC can be treated with curative lung resection,
whereas advanced and metastatic NSCLC have very poor

adenocarcinoma [5], has influenced treatment strategies
by providing rationale for treatment with tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI) directed against these targets. This has
also contributed to the approval of erlotinib for mutated
EGFR tumors [6, 7] and crizotinib for ALK rearranged
neoplasms [8].
Preclinical and clinical data indicate that tyrosine
kinase inhibitors are generally effective only in subsets
of patients bearing tumors of a defined genotype. From
a genetic perspective, each organ-specific or histologic
tumor type is a collection of many relatively rare tumors,
carrying different genetic alterations and thus with a
likelihood of responding to different targeted inhibitors.
Therefore, a prerequisite for a successful targeted therapy
is a precise molecular annotation of tumors which allows
selection of patients that could benefit from that therapy.
Even with optimal patient identification, a fraction of
patients do not respond ab initio (primary resistance).
Moreover, after an initial clinical response, cancer
often recurs due to the development of drug resistance
(secondary resistance) [9]. Therefore, the challenges
associated with targeted therapies are to predict the
mechanisms that lead to resistance and to find treatment
strategies to circumvent these hurdles.
ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase closely related
to ALK and LTK [10, 11]. ROS1 oncogenic activation
has been observed in patients with different tumor types
such as glioblastoma, NSCLC, cholangiocarcinoma,
gastric, ovarian and colon carcinoma, angiosarcoma
and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) [12].
In all these cases, ROS1 activation is associated with
inter-chromosomal translocations or intra-chromosomal
deletions that result in chimeric genes, comprised of the
intracellular portion of ROS1 fused to a variety of different
partners [12, 13]. These genetic rearrangements lead to
protein fusions that exhibit constitutive kinase activity
and are associated with sensitivity to TKIs. The kinase
inhibitor crizotinib, which has been shown to negatively
affect proliferation of cells expressing ROS1 fusions [14],
has demonstrated clinical efficacy in ROS1 fusion positive
NSCLC and IMT patients [15; Ou SI, et al. Crizotinib
therapy for patients with advanced ROS1-rearranged nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), WCLC 2013 Meeting,
2013]. As seen with other kinase inhibitors used in the
treatment of solid malignancies, resistance to crizotinib
has been recently reported in patients bearing tumors
containing ROS1 fusions. Resistance was attributed to
either acquired mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain [16]
or activation of the EGFR pathway [17].
This study describes the identification of additional
novel mechanisms of resistance to ROS1 targeted drugs.

Establishment of cell lines resistant to ROS1
inhibitors
The HCC78 lung cancer cell line is the prototype
of “ROS1-addicted” cells, displaying the SLC34A2-ROS1
gene rearrangement that leads to constitutive ROS1 kinase
activation [11] and dependence on ROS1 for growth. We
confirmed this dependence as treatment with a ROS1
inhibitor resulted in a strong impairment of cell viability
and growth (Fig. 1A).
To determine potential mechanisms of acquired
resistance to ROS1 kinase inhibitors, we used the specific
inhibitor JNJ-ROS1i-A [Mevellec L, et al. Discovery of
potent and selective Ros1 inhibitors with a unique DFGout binding mode. 2014 AACR Annual Meeting. 2014].
This molecule inhibited the kinase activity of isolated
recombinant ROS1 with an IC50 of approximately 30 nM.
Growth of Ba/F3 cells engineered to express ROS1 and
dependent on its kinase activity was inhibited at a similar
concentration, as was ROS1 autophosphorylation in
HCC78 cells. At the 1 µM concentration this compound
inhibited less than 6% of kinases in a panel of 400. We
treated HCC78 cells with increasing concentrations of
JNJ-ROS1i-A for extended periods of time and thereby
generated cell lines resistant to several concentrations
of this inhibitor (1, 2, and 4 µM). The biological and
biochemical properties of these resistant cells were then
evaluated. The growth rate of the resistant cells was
only slightly different from that of parental cells, both
in the presence and in absence of the ROS1 inhibitor. A
representative example is shown in Fig. 1A.
ROS1 phosphorylation was substantially decreased
in these cells, while phosphorylation of AKT, MAPK
and S6 kinase, components of downstream oncogenic
signaling pathways, was maintained or increased (Fig.
1B). Interestingly, ROS1 protein and mRNA levels were
substantially lower in resistant cells (Fig. 1B and Suppl.
Fig. 1A) compared to the parental HCC78 cells. However,
decreased transcription was not due to the loss of ROS1
gene copies (Suppl. Fig. 1B).
To demonstrate that the growth of these resistant
cells was no longer dependent on ROS1, we transfected
the parental and resistant HCC78 cells with ROS1 specific
siRNAs (Suppl. Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1C, growth
of the parental cells was strongly impaired upon ROS1
silencing, while no substantial change was observed
in resistant cells. These results suggest that resistance
to the ROS1 inhibitor developed through a mechanism
independent of the rearranged kinase.

KRAS mutation confers resistance to ROS1
inhibitors

whose role as a negative predictor for the efficacy of
tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been clearly shown in nonsmall cell lung cancer [18] and colorectal cancer [19].
To confirm that the presence of mutated KRAS
could impair the response of HCC78 cells to ROS1 kinase
inhibitors, we introduced KRAS cDNAs harboring either
the G12C or the G12V mutation through viral transduction
(Suppl. Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2B, cells expressing
mutated KRAS were significantly less sensitive to JNJROS1i-A. We also performed the inverse experiment,
silencing KRAS in the resistant cells. Reduction of
KRAS expression restored sensitivity of the resistant cells
to JNJ-ROS1i-A (Fig. 2C and Suppl. Fig. 3). We also
tested whether the presence of this mutation could render
HCC78 cells resistant to other ROS1 inhibitors, such as
crizotinib and foretinib [16, 20-22]. As shown in Fig.
2D and 2E, JNJ-ROS1i-A resistant and parental HCC78

As described above, ROS1 inhibitor resistant
HCC78 cells showed sustained activation of MAPK and
AKT, despite the lower levels of ROS1 phosphorylation
compared to parental cells. To determine the reason for
this constitutive activation in the resistant cells, we looked
for the presence of mutations in signal transducers that are
frequently aberrantly activated in human tumors, such as
KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, and are responsible
for increased activation of MAPK and AKT. While no
changes were found in the previously described mutational
hot spots in NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA (Suppl. Table 1), a
mutation was detected in codon 12 (G12C) of KRAS (Fig.
2A). This mutation was not present in parental HCC78
cells. This is a well-known KRAS activating mutation,

cells expressing G12C KRAS were both insensitive to
crizotinib and foretinib.
Because resistant cells display a strong activation
of MAPK and AKT, we evaluated whether they were
sensitive to inhibitors of these two kinases. Therefore,
parental and ROS1 inhibitor resistant HCC78 cells were
treated with U0126 and MK2206 (MAPK and AKT
inhibitors, respectively), and their effects on growth were
evaluated. As expected, resistant cells were sensitive
to AKT and MAPK inhibitors (Fig. 2F), confirming
dependence for growth on these pathways. Altogether
these results point to KRAS activating mutations as a
mechanism of resistance to ROS1 inhibitors.

(NCT00585195). We obtained cells resistant to 0.72 µM
and 1.4 µM crizotinib (Fig. 3A). As was the case with
JNJ-ROS1i-A (Suppl. Fig. 4A), crizotinib resistant cells
displayed a reduction in ROS1 phosphorylation, decreased
ROS1 expression (both at the protein and mRNA level)
and sustained AKT and MAPK activation (Suppl. Fig.
4A, 4B). Sequencing did not reveal mutations in KRAS,
BRAF or PIK3CA in these cells (Suppl. Fig. 4C and Suppl.
Table 1). Interestingly, an NRAS activating mutation,
Q61K, was detected in crizotinib resistant, but not parental
HCC78 cells (Fig. 3B). Similarly to what was observed in
JNJ-ROS1i-A resistant cells, sensitivity to crizotinib was
restored upon NRAS silencing (Fig. 3C, Suppl. Fig. 3C).
Moreover, expression of Q61K NRAS rendered parental
HCC78 cells insensitive to crizotinib, JNJ-ROS1i-A and
foretinib (Fig. 3D).
It has been previously shown that cells resistant
to crizotinib as a consequence of mutations in the ROS1
kinase remain sensitive to the inhibitory activity of other
ROS1 inhibitors, such as foretinib. In the present study,
cells resistant to JNJ-ROS1i-A were cross-resistant to
crizotinib and the crizotinib resistant cells were cross-

lines were also resistant to foretinib (Fig. 4B).

resulted in strong up-regulation of SLC34A2-ROS1, both
at the mRNA and protein level, providing evidence for
RAS pathway dependent regulation of SLC34A2-ROS1
expression.

Activation of the RAS pathway leads to downregulation of SLC34A2-ROS1

Elevated KRAS expression confers resistance to
ROS1 inhibitors

As described above, we observed a decrease of
SLC34A2-ROS1 at the protein and mRNA level in both
the JNJ-ROS1i-A and crizotinib resistant cells (Suppl.
Fig. 1A, 4A). We hypothesized that this decrease could
be a compensatory mechanism that prevents signal
over-activation in cells with a constitutively active RAS
pathway. We therefore assessed whether SLC34A2-ROS1
was also decreased in HCC78 cells transduced with viral
constructs driving expression of constitutively active
mutated KRAS or NRAS, or wt KRAS. As shown in
Fig. 5A, cells with activated RAS pathway displayed a
strong down-regulation of SLC34A2-ROS1 mRNA. To
investigate whether RAS-dependent downstream signaling
pathways were involved in SLC34A2-ROS1 downregulation, we treated HCC78 cells resistant to either JNJROS1i-A or crizotinib with MAPK or AKT inhibitors.
Fig. 5B and 5C show that MAPK and AKT inhibition

As the role of RAS proteins in conferring resistance
to tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be due not only to the
presence of activating mutations, but also to amplification
and elevated expression of RAS genes [23, 24], we
wondered whether these mechanisms could also confer
resistance to ROS1 inhibitors. HCC78 cells (bearing a
normal KRAS copy number) were transduced with a wt
KRAS expression construct (Suppl. Fig. 5A, 5B). These
cells displayed a significantly reduced sensitivity to
crizotinib, JNJ-ROS1i-A and foretinib (Fig. 4C).
Altogether these data show that genetic alterations
(such as activating mutations and gene amplification)
leading to constitutive activation of RAS family proteins
can confer resistance to ROS1 inhibitors.
Based on our results, which demonstrate that RAS

activation can mediate resistance to ROS1 inhibitors in
vitro, we asked whether this pathway might also mediate
resistance in ROS1+ NSCLC patients that develop
acquired resistance to crizotinib. We therefore performed
fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes binding
to the genomic region of chromosome 12 harboring the
KRAS gene on tumor samples from four patients with
acquired resistance to crizotinib. One of these patients
had focal KRAS amplification with a mean KRAS signal
of 4.2 copies per cell and a mean KRAS/CEP4 ratio of

2.1 (Fig. 6A). Unfortunately, a crizotinib pre-treatment
sample was not available for comparative testing. The
tumors from the remaining three patients did not display
KRAS amplification (Fig. 6B-D). We also sequenced
KRAS, BRAF and NRAS in two patient samples, but did
not detect any mutations. Material from the remaining
two patient samples was insufficient for analysis or failed
quality control.

DISCUSSION

treated with ROS1 inhibitors are likely to become resistant
to therapy. Indeed, mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib,
such as acquired ROS1 mutations leading to steric
interference with drug binding [16] or EGFR pathway
activation [17], have recently been described.
As knowledge of possible mechanisms of resistance
could help in defining strategies aimed at either preventing
or overcoming resistance, we generated ROS1+ HCC78
lung cancer cell resistant to ROS1 inhibitors. In this
in vitro model we found that activation of the RAS
pathway, due to either KRAS or NRAS mutations or to
KRAS amplification, rendered the cells resistant to ROS1
targeting drugs. Activation of the RAS pathway has
been described as a mechanism of primary or secondary
resistance in colon cancer, where the presence of KRAS
activating mutations in the primary tumor is a negative
predictive factor of response to the anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab [29, 30]. Similar
mutations and KRAS gene amplification have been shown
to confer secondary resistance to anti-EGFR treatment in
the same tumor type [31, 32]. Moreover, RAS pathway
activation has been shown to predict primary resistance
to imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors [33] and to
confer secondary resistance to MET inhibitors in METaddicted cells [23]. However, the potential role of the
RAS family in driving resistance to ROS1 inhibitors
has not been reported so far. In this study we show that

ROS1 rearrangement was first described in 2003 in
a glioblastoma cell line [25] and later identified in a nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line [11]. Analysis of
tumors from NSCLC patients showed that approximately
1% display rearrangements of the ROS1 gene. In vitro
studies confirmed that the rearranged ROS1 kinase is
constitutively active and that it behaves as a tumor driver,
since cells are addicted to its continuous activation. These
observations implicated ROS1 as a candidate therapeutic
target in NSCLC. ROS1 is closely related to the ALK
kinase [26]; the tyrosine kinase domains of ALK and
ROS1 have 77% amino acid identity within the ATPbinding sites. Because of this high level of homology,
several ALK inhibitors are also active on ROS1 [27].
Preclinical studies demonstrating that the FDA-approved
ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, also inhibits ROS1 provided
rationale for its use in treatment of ROS1+ NSCLC
patients [28]. In an ongoing Phase I study, crizotinib
treatment resulted in a response rate of 60% (21 out of 35
patients) among patients with advanced ROS1+ NSCLC
[Ou SI, et al. Crizotinib therapy for patients with advanced
ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
WCLC 2013 Meeting, 2013]. However, as suggested by
the clinical experience obtained with drugs targeting other
receptor tyrosine kinases and by preclinical data, tumors

activation of the RAS pathway can confer both primary
and secondary resistance in ROS1 addicted cells.
Virus mediated expression of either wild type KRAS
or constitutively active KRAS or NRAS in HCC78 cells
resulted in decreased sensitivity to ROS1 inhibitors.
Additionally, silencing of mutated RAS proteins in ROS1
inhibitor resistant HCC78 cells rescued sensitivity to the
inhibitors. Interestingly, two different members of the RAS
family were found mutated in the same cell line rendered
resistant to two diverse inhibitors (NRAS in HCC78 cells
resistant to the non-specific ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib
and KRAS in HCC78 cell resistant to the specific
inhibitor JNJ-ROS1i-A). This selective mutation/drug
pairing (KRAS/JNJ-ROS1i-A and NRAS/crizotinib) was
observed in resistant cell populations that were generated
independently. This suggests that the drug might play a
role in selecting cells present in the original population,
harboring either KRAS or NRAS mutations and leading to
the activation of one of these two pathways, which are
similar but not identical. The differences in the spectrum
of kinases inhibited by crizotinib and JNJ-ROS1i-A might
influence this selective process.
To demonstrate that our findings in vitro are relevant
in the clinical setting, we examined tumors from four
ROS1+ NSCLC patients who relapsed upon crizotinib
treatment for the presence of KRAS/NRAS mutations
and KRAS amplification. Focal KRAS amplification was
detected in one tumor, but we could not determine whether
this event was present prior to crizotinib treatment or was
acquired following treatment due to the absence of a pretreatment sample.
Interestingly, we observed a decrease of ROS1
protein in the inhibitor resistant cells. This does not seem
to be restricted to RAS-mediated resistance as it has also
been found in HCC78 cells resistant to crizotinib due
to activation of the EGFR pathway [17]. Thus, downregulation of the ROS1 oncogene seems to be a common
feature of resistance resulting from bypass signaling
and is possibly due to a potentially detrimental effect of
excessive signaling in these cells.
As previously mentioned, one of the major goals
in the field of targeted therapy is to identify means to
overcome resistance to treatment. It has been shown
previously that foretinib, a potent inhibitor of oncogenic
ROS1 fusion proteins [22], retains activity on the
crizotinib resistant G2032R ROS1 mutation. However, in
our study foretinib was ineffective when resistance was
due to the presence of activating KRAS/NRAS mutations or
KRAS amplification. This can be explained by constitutive
activation of the RAS pathway downstream of ROS1
that renders inhibition of this tyrosine kinase irrelevant.
Concerning treatment, ROS1 resistant patients displaying
RAS pathway activation are unlikely to be responsive
to more potent and more specific new generation ROS1
inhibitors. As expected and confirmed in this study, these
resistant cells are instead sensitive to inhibitors of the RAS
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathway. Therapeutic options to efficiently target RAS
are currently not available, but interesting opportunities
have been recently reported [34]. One of these new drugs,
indeed, targets the KRAS G12C mutation that confers
resistance to JNJ-ROS1i-A [35].
The identification of RAS activation as a mechanism
of resistance to ROS1 targeted therapies has some
important clinical implications: (i) the identification of
RAS genetic alterations in ROS1+ primary tumors would
likely be a negative predictor of efficacy of targeted drugs;
(ii) the post treatment identification of the same alterations
would discourage treatment with new generation ROS1
inhibitors; (iii) the appearance of RAS mutations could be
monitored in the plasma through the analysis of circulating
DNA [31].

METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
HCC78 cells were purchased from the Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen
(DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) cell bank and were
cultured in RPMI medium 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.
293T cells were obtained from ATCC. The genetic identity
of the cell lines was confirmed by short tandem repeat
profiling (Cell ID, Promega, Madison, WI, USA), which
was last repeated in March 2014.
Crizotinib and foretinib were purchased from
Sequoia Research Products (Pangbourne, UK). MAPK
inhibitor (U0126) was purchased from Promega and
the AKT inhibitor (Mk2206) from Merck (Whitehouse
Station, NJ, USA). The ROS1 inhibitor JNJ-ROS1i-A was
provided by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV; Limited samples
of compound JNJ-ROS1i-A are available for academic
research from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, and, subject
to potential third party rights, can be made available to
qualified researchers for their own academic research
use, after the signature of a Material Transfer Agreement

Generation of HCC78 cells resistant to JNJROS1i-A or crizotinib
HCC78 cells were exposed to increasing
concentrations of JNJ-ROS1i-A or crizotinib, beginning
with concentrations that resulted in reduction of culture
growth by approximately 50 to 70%. The concentration
was progressively increased every 15 to 30 days during
5190

Oncotarget

a six month period, with changes in concentration taking
place when the cells regained a growth rate similar to that
of untreated cells. ROS1i-A-RES 1, 2, and 4 correspond
to distinct HCC78 cell populations resistant to different
concentrations (in µM) of JNJ-ROS1i-A; CRIZ-RES
0.72 and CRIZ-RES 1.4 indicate HCC78 cell populations
resistant to different concentrations (in µM) of crizotinib.
All the established resistant cell lines were maintained
in culture in the presence of the inhibitor at the final
concentration that was used to generate resistance.

Golden (Promega). PCR products were purified using
AMPure (Agencourt Bioscience Corp., Beckman Coulter
S.p.A, Milan, Italy) according to manufacturer procedures
and analyzed on a 3730 DNA Analyzer, ABI capillary
electrophoresis system (Applied Biosystems).
The SNaPshot assay for evaluation of multiple
oncogenic mutations in BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, and other
tumor-related genes was conducted by amplification
using 13 multiplexed PCR reactions followed by single
nucleotide base extension reactions. The products were
separated by capillary electrophoresis and analyzed using
GeneMapper 4.0 as has been previously described [36].

Patient samples

Western blot analysis

Tumor samples were tested following informed
written consent from each patient. Patient details are
provided in Suppl. Table 3.

Whole-protein extracts were prepared using LB
buffer (½ vol. H2O, ¼ vol. Tris HCl pH 6.8, ¼ vol. SDS
10%) and quantified using the BCA Protein Assay kit
(Pierce, Rockford, lL, USA). Protein extracts (60µg)
were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted and
analyzed using chemiluminescence ECL Western Blotting
(Promega). The inhibitors JNJ-ROS1i-A and crizotinib
were added 4 hours before cell lysis, where indicated.
The following antibodies were used: anti-ROS (C-20,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); anti–
phospho-AKT (Ser473), anti-AKT, anti–phospho-p44/42
MAPK, anti-p44/42 MAPK and anti pS6 Ribosomal
Protein (Cell Signalling, Beverly, MA, USA); antiKRAS and Vinculin (1931) (Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary
IgG HRP-Peroxidase antibodies were obtained from
Amersham (Uppsala, Sweden).
For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed with EB
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM
sodium chloride, 10% glycerol and 1% Triton X-100) in
the presence of 1 µg ml-1 leupeptin, 3 µg ml-1aprotinin,
1 µg ml-1pepstatin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl
fluoride and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. After
immunoprecipitation with the anti-ROS1 Ab (C-20), highstringency washes were performed. Phosphotyrosine was
detected with the anti-phosphotyrosine clone 4G10 mAb
(Millipore, Billerica, MT, USA).

mRNA and gDNA analysis
mRNA and gDNA analyses were performed with
standard techniques.
mRNA (500ng) extracted using miRNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands), was reverse transcribed into
cDNA using the Multiscribe MuLV retrotranscriptase and
random primers; cDNA (250ng) was amplified by Realtime qPCR using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Applied
Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time qPCR was
performed by using the following primers:
hROS1 Fw: 5’ -GCCTTATCCAGCTCATTCCA-3’;

Cell growth assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plastic culture plates
(1500/well), in the presence of the indicated drugs,
inhibitors or vehicle (DMSO). Cells were fixed in 11%
glutaraldehyde and stained with crystal violet at the
indicated days after seeding. The dye retained by the cells
was then solubilized in 10% acetic acid and the Optical
Density (570nm) was measured using a Multilabel Reader
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MT, USA).

KRAS Fluorescence in situ hybridization

lentiviral particles containing the empty vector, pRRL.
sin.cPPT.CMV.Wpre. G12C-KRAS was obtained by
mutagenesis of wt-KRAS using the QuikChange Lightning
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). Q61K-NRAS was purchased from
ADDGENE (Cambridge, MA, USA). KRAS and NRAS
mRNA expression levels of infected cells were evaluated
72 hours after cell infection.

FFPE tissue sections were incubated at 56oC for 2-4
h, dewaxed in CitriSolv (Fisher) for 5 min three times,
and dehydrated. Tissue permeabilization and protein
digestion were carried out by incubations in 2x SSC at
75˚C for 15-40 min and in Proteinase K solution (0.6mg/
ml in 2X SSC) at 45˚C for 20-48 min, respectively. After
ethanol dehydration, the probe was applied to the selected
hybridization areas, to which a coverslip was added and
sealed with rubber cement. DNA co-denaturation was
performed at 85oC for 15 min in dry oven. Hybridization
was allowed to occur at 37oC for 16 h in humid
chamber. Post-hybridization washes were performed by
sequential 2-min incubations in 2×SSC/0.3% NP-40 at
74oC and 2×SSC at room temperature. Chromatin was
counterstained with DAPI diluted in anti-fade reagent.
Analysis was performed on an epifluorescence
microscope using single interference filters sets for
green (FITC), red (Texas red), blue (DAPI), gold, aqua,
dual (red/green), and triple (blue, red, green) band pass
filters. For each interference filter, monochromatic images
were acquired and merged using CytoVision (Leica
Microsystems Inc). A minimum of 50 tumor nuclei are
evaluated per specimen.
To determine KRAS gene amplification, the
LSI KRAS SpectrumGold and CEP12 (D12Z3)
SpectrumGreen probes (Abbott Molecular) were used. The
classification was based primarily on the ratio between
mean copy number of the gene of interest and the mean
copy number of the control probe (CEP12). The specimen
was classified as positive for gene amplification when the
gene/control ratio was ≥2.0.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed
Student’s t tests. A P value of <0.05 was considered
significant.

Silencing

Financial support

The siRNA targeting reagents were purchased from
Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA), as a SMARTpool
of four distinct siRNA species targeting different
sequences of the target transcript. As negative controls,
scramble siRNAs that did not target KRAS and NRAS
were designed using the GenScript web tool. These
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as a pool.
Silencing of KRAS and NRAS expression was achieved
by reverse transfection of HCC78 cells with 20 nM
siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA).
