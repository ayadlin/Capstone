Abstract
Nanotechnology offers novel delivery vehicles for cancer therapeutics. Potential advantages of nanoscale
platforms include improved pharmacokinetics, encapsulation of cytotoxic agents, enhanced accumulation
of therapeutics in the tumor microenvironment, and improved therapeutic structures and bioactivity. Here,
we report the design of a novel amphiphilic molecule that self-assembles into nanostructures for intracellular delivery of cytotoxic peptides. Specifically, a cationic α-helical (KLAKLAK)2 peptide that is known
to induce cancer cell death by membrane disruption was integrated into a peptide amphiphile (PA) that
self-assembles into bioactive, cylindrical nanofibers. PAs are composed of a hydrophobic alkyl tail, a
β-sheet forming peptide, and a bioactive peptide that is displayed on the surface of the nanofiber after
self-assembly. PA nanostructures that included (KLAKLAK)2 were readily internalized by breast cancer
cells, in contrast to the (KLAKLAK)2 peptide that on its own was not cell permeable. (KLAKLAK)2
nanostructures, but not the peptides alone, also induced breast cancer cell death by caspase-independent
and Bax/Bak–independent mechanisms associated with membrane disruption. Significantly, (KLAKLAK)2
nanostructures induced cell death more robustly in transformed breast epithelial cells than in untransformed
cells, suggesting a degree of tumor selectivity. Our results provide proof-of-principle that self-assembling PAs
can be rationally designed to generate nanostructures that can efficiently deliver cytotoxic peptides to cancer
cells. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3020–6. ©2010 AACR.

pharmacokinetics. The enhanced permeability of tumor
vasculature results in passive accumulation of nanoparticles
in tumors. Therapeutic cargo, imaging agents, and tumortargeting epitopes can be multiplexed into single nanostructures, thereby engineering controlled tumor delivery of these
agents.
Recent studies have shown the utility of peptides designed
to activate cell death in cancer cells. One promising strategy
uses cationic peptides, such as (KLAKLAK)2 (abbreviated
“KLAK”), as membrane-disrupting agents. In the presence
of membranes, this peptide forms an amphipathic α-helix,
with the charged and nonpolar residues on opposite faces
(2). Because cells do not efficiently internalize KLAK peptide, it is typically fused with cell-penetrating moieties or
receptor ligands (3–6). With facilitated uptake, KLAK and
other cationic peptides disrupt mitochondrial and/or
plasma membranes and initiate caspase-dependent and/
or caspase-independent cell death, respectively, reducing
tumor burden in vivo (3–7).
Despite potential utility, peptides have several shortcomings, including poor cell penetration, immunogenicity, and
rapid in vivo degradation (8). We postulated that incorporating peptides into nanostructures might be an effective
strategy to overcome these deficiencies. To this end, we
incorporated the KLAK peptide into a novel class of peptide amphiphiles (PA) developed in our laboratory (9, 10).
PA molecules have three domains: a hydrophobic alkyl tail,
a β-sheet promoting sequence, and a bioactive peptide

domain. In biological fluids, the self-assembly of PAs into
high-aspect-ratio nanostructures is driven by electrostatic
screening of charged residues, hydrophobic collapse of alkyl tails into the fiber core, and intermolecular hydrogen
bonding, particularly in the β-domain. These nanofibers
surface-display peptide segments at high density and have
been found to be highly bioactive. PA nanofibers have
been used to promote functional recovery after spinal cord
injury and angiogenesis (11). Recently, the high aspect ratio of PAs was shown to exhibit greater bioactivity relative
to spherical aggregates of similar molecules (12). A major
promise of PA nanostructures is the potential for drugfree, biodegradable therapeutics. We report here that a
PA incorporating the KLAK peptide self-assembles into nanostructures that are readily internalized by cancer cells
and induce cell death, thereby supporting the potential
utility of PA-based cancer therapeutics.

Materials and Methods
Material synthesis and characterization. Peptides and
PAs were prepared using standard fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl
solid-phase peptide synthesis methods and were purified by
reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.
Amino acid analyses were done by Commonwealth Biotechnologies. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were
done on a Jasco CD Spectrometer J-715. PAs were imaged using a JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscope. A more
detailed description of the materials is included in Supplementary Data.
Cell culture and reagents. SKBR-3 cells (American Type
Culture Collection) were grown in α-MEM with 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillinstreptomycin, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 20 mmol/L
nonessential amino acids, HEPES, and 50 μmol/L β-mercaptoethanol. MDA-MB-231 cells (gift of Jennifer Koblinski,
Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) were maintained in
DMEM/F-12 with 2× nonessential amino acids, 5% FBS,
1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/L L -glutamine, and
100 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin. Wild-type and Bax−/−/
Bak−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), a gift of Craig
Thompson (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; ref.
13), were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 100 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin. MCF-10A
cells stably expressing H-RasV12 or empty vector (14) were
maintained in DMEM/F-12 with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/mL
epidermal growth factor (Sigma), 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone
(Sigma), 100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma), 10 μg/mL insulin
(Sigma), and 100 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin. All cells
were grown at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Unless otherwise
specified, reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Lexatumumab was provided by Robin Humphreys (Human Genome
Sciences, Rockville, MD; ref. 15).
Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Images were
taken with a Nikon C1 confocal microscope. Flow cytometry
was done using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur or a DakoCyomation CyAn.

Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, 0.1% SDS,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1%
NP40) containing 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Lysates were run
on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes, and proteins were detected by
immunoblotting using antibodies against cleaved caspase-3
(Cell Signaling) or tubulin (Sigma).
Cell viability. Cell viability was measured using the MTSbased CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation
Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Trypan blue (0.04%; Sigma) exclusion was also used to
identify viable cells with intact plasma membranes.
Annexin V assay. Annexin V–positive cells were identified
using the Annexin-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions except
that 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used.
Membrane potential assays. Cells were labeled with
50 nmol/L MitoTracker Red and DiOC5(3) (Invitrogen) to
stain mitochondrial and plasma membranes, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence was
measured at 25°C using a DakoCyomation CyAn.
Transmission electron microscopy. Images were obtained using a JEOL 1220 microscope. Cells were fixed in
2% glutaraldehyde/0.1 mol/L sodium cacodylate, treated with
2% osmium tetroxide, and stained with uranyl acetate/lead
citrate (Electron Microscopy Sciences).
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was assessed
by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests using GraphPad Prism 5.0b software.

Results and Discussion
The central component of this nanotechnology platform is
the KLAK PA (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1). KLAK PA
monomers self-assembled in PBS into nanostructures 100
to 900 nm in length and 8 to 10 nm in diameter (Fig. 1B).
Because the membrane-disrupting activity of the KLAK
peptide (Supplementary Fig. S2) depends on its α-helical
conformation (3), we examined the secondary structure of
KLAK-containing molecules. The CD spectrum of KLAK PA
showed helical structure, whereas KLAK peptide was predominantly random coil (Fig. 1C). We next examined the uptake of fluorescein-labeled KLAK PA (Supplementary Fig. S3)
and KLAK peptide (Supplementary Fig. S4) by SKBR-3 breast
cancer cells. KLAK PA, but not peptide, was internalized
(Fig. 1D). Hence, incorporating the KLAK epitope into a PA
stabilizes its helical conformation and facilitates its intracellular delivery.
To determine the cytotoxicity of KLAK PA, we treated
human MDA-MB-231 and SKBR-3 breast cancer cells for
24 hours with varying concentrations of KLAK PA or KLAK
peptide and measured cell viability by MTS assay (Fig. 2A).
The IC50 of the KLAK PA was 6.04 μmol/L (95% confidence
interval, 5.06–7.21 μmol/L) and 5.67 μmol/L (95% confidence
interval, 5.30–6.26 μmol/L) in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR-3
cells, respectively, whereas the KLAK peptide was inactive.

Standley et al.

A scrambled KLAK peptide sequence designed to partially
disrupt the amphipathic helix was incorporated into a PA
(Supplementary Fig. S5), which formed nanofibers with reduced helical structure (Supplementary Fig. S6) and diminished cytotoxicity compared with the KLAK PA (Fig. 2A).
To investigate cell death mechanism(s), breast cancer
cells were incubated with PBS, KLAK peptide, KLAK PA,
or scrambled KLAK PA for 18 hours. Consistent with the cell
viability results, KLAK PA, but not peptide, robustly induced
Annexin V–positive cells, whereas scrambled KLAK PA was
less effective (Fig. 2B). The majority of cells treated with
KLAK PA were both Annexin V and DAPI positive, even
when treated for only 1 hour (data not shown), suggesting
that these nanostructures rapidly compromise plasma membrane integrity. Within minutes of adding KLAK PA to cells,
the plasma and mitochondrial membrane potentials were

reduced, suggesting membrane disruption (Fig. 2C, left).
To assess the role of oxidative stress in KLAK PA–mediated
cell death, cells were pretreated for 1 hour with 3 mmol/L
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). NAC partly attenuated cell death
induced by KLAK PA but not that by the proapoptotic
TRAIL receptor-2 monoclonal antibody lexatumumab,
which served as a positive control (Fig. 2C, right; ref. 15).
Consistent with reports showing enhanced sensitivity of
cancer cells to cationic peptides due to increased negatively
charged membrane phospholipids (16), we observed that
MCF-10A breast cells transformed by H-RasV12 were more
sensitive to KLAK PA–induced cell death than were the untransformed MCF-10A-vector cells (Fig. 2D). These results
suggest that the KLAK PA has some tumor selectivity.
To determine whether KLAK PA–induced cell death was
caspase dependent, we incubated MDA-MB-231 cells with

MitoTracker Red CMXRos and TO-PRO-3, respectively. Bar, 20 μm. Internalization of fluorescein-labeled KLAK PA or peptide in SKBR-3 cells was
also determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (far right).

MDA-MB-231 and SKBR-3 cells were treated with PBS or 10 μmol/L KLAK peptide, KLAK PA, or scrambled KLAK PA for 18 h. Cell death was determined
by Annexin V labeling. C, SKBR-3 cells were treated with 10 μmol/L KLAK PA. Plasma membrane [DiOC5(3)] and mitochondrial membrane (MitoTracker
Red) potentials (normalized to PBS control) were determined over 60 min (left). MDA-MB-231 or SKBR-3 cells were incubated for 24 h with PBS,
10 μmol/L KLAK PA, or 1 μg/mL lexatumumab (Lexa) with or without 3 mmol/L NAC pretreatment. Cell viability was measured by MTS assay (right).

KLAK PA in the presence of z-VAD-fmk. Although z-VADfmk inhibited lexatumumab cytotoxicity, it had no effect
on cell death induced by KLAK PA or scrambled KLAK PA
(Fig. 3A and B). Consistent with these findings, lexatumumab, but not KLAK PA, induced caspase-3 processing to its
active subunit (Fig. 3C). Moreover, wild-type and Bax−/−/
Bak−/− double knockout (DKO) MEFs were equally susceptible to KLAK PA cytotoxicity (Fig. 3D). Thus, KLAK PA induces
caspase-independent and Bax/Bak–independent cell death.
To investigate ultrastructural changes, MDA-MB-231 cells
were treated with PBS, KLAK peptide, or KLAK PA and examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cells
treated with KLAK PA did not exhibit apoptotic morphology,

but rather had distorted plasma membranes, abundant
fiber-like structures (arrows), and lysosome-like structures
(arrowheads) and were largely devoid of mitochondria
(Fig. 4A). These changes were not observed in cells treated
with KLAK peptide (Fig. 4B) or PBS (Fig. 4C). We also observed that KLAK PA was much more efficient than the
scrambled PA at permeabilizing cell membranes as determined by trypan blue staining (Fig. 4D), confirming that
KLAK PA nanostructures induce cell death by disrupting
cell membranes.
We have shown that PAs can be rationally designed to selfassemble into nanostructures that deliver cytotoxic peptides
to cancer cells. Specifically, incorporating the KLAK peptide

into PA nanostructures stabilizes its bioactive α-helical
conformation and renders the peptide cell-permeable. Additionally, KLAK PA nanostructures potently induce caspaseindependent and Bax/Bak–independent cell death in breast
cancer cells by lysing plasma membranes, a finding consistent with some reports on the cytotoxic mechanism of cationic peptides (6, 7). Moreover, KLAK PAs induce cell death
more robustly in transformed breast epithelial cells than in

untransformed cells, suggesting some tumor selectivity. Although others have recently reported PA-based platforms
for cancer, the cytotoxic mechanisms of these nanostructures have yet to be fully characterized (17, 18). From a therapeutic standpoint, nanostructures will likely have to be
PEGylated and/or tumor targeted to maximize their efficacy
and reduce systemic toxicity in vivo. Having already shown
the feasibility of co-assembling PAs (19), we will focus future
