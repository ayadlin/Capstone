with the ER protein folding capacity and is termed the unfolded
protein response (1–3).
The unfolded protein response is fundamentally a cytoprotective response. However, excessive or prolonged unfolded
protein response results in apoptotic cell death. Although
caspase-12 in rodents and its human homologue caspase-4 are
thought to be key mediators (4–6), activation of other caspases,
including caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase9, has been reported to be involved in ER stress–induced
apoptosis (4, 7–9). Several recent studies have challenged the
role of caspase-12 and caspase-4 as ER stress was found to
induce similar degrees of apoptosis regardless of the presence or
absence of these caspases (10, 11). Nevertheless, we have shown
that ER stress induces apoptosis in human melanoma cell lines
by activation of caspase-4 when the MEK/ERK signaling pathway
is inhibited (12). The majority of melanoma cell lines are
otherwise relatively resistant to ER stress–induced apoptosis,
except that one line, Me1007, seems to be exceptionally sensitive
to apoptosis induced by ER stress inducers although the MEK/
ERK pathway is also constitutively activated in the cells (12).
This suggests that, besides activation of caspase-4, ER stress can
potentially initiate other apoptotic mechanism(s), which is less
sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the MEK/ERK pathway, but
nevertheless blocked in most melanoma cell lines.
Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is
an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis that was initially thought to
be primarily expressed in terminally differentiated cells, such as
cardiac and skeletal myocytes and neurons (13). ARC seems to be
distinct from most endogenous apoptosis inhibitors in that it
cannot only inhibit death receptor–mediated apoptotic signaling
by binding to and inhibiting caspase-8 but also block the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by physically interacting with
Bax and inhibiting its activation (13–15). Moreover, ARC can also
bind to FADD, Fas, and caspase-2, which protects cells from
apoptosis induced by varying stimuli (13, 14). Recently, ARC was
reported to be expressed by various human cancer cells and to be
largely located in nuclei (16, 17). However, the functional
significance of endogenous ARC in cancer cells remains to be fully
elucidated.
In the present report, we examined the mechanisms by which
ER stress induces apoptosis in the melanoma cell line Me1007
and explored the potential role of ARC in protection of the
majority of melanoma lines from ER stress–induced apoptosis.
We show that the ER stress inducer thapsigargin or tunicamycin
induced apoptosis of Me1007 cells by activation of caspase-8,
which was inhibitable by overexpression of ARC. In addition,
relatively high levels of endogenous ARC expression seemed to
play a role in inhibition of caspase-8 activation and apoptosis
induced by ER stress in most melanoma cell lines. In contrast to
previous reports, both endogenous and exogenous ARC in

Abstract
We have shown previously that most melanoma cell lines
are insensitive to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress–
induced apoptosis, but resistance can be reversed through
activation of caspase-4 by inhibition of the MEK/ERK
pathway. We report in this study that apoptosis was induced
by the ER stress inducer thapsigargin or tunicamycin via a
caspase-8–mediated pathway in the melanoma cell line
Me1007, although the MEK/ERK pathway was activated in
this cell line. The high sensitivity of Me1007 to ER stress–
induced apoptosis was associated with low expression levels
of the apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment
domain (ARC) protein that was expressed at relatively high
levels in the resistant melanoma cell lines. Transfection of
cDNA encoding ARC into Me1007 cells inhibited both
caspase-8 activation and apoptosis induced by thapsigargin
or tunicamycin. In contrast, inhibition of ARC by small
interfering RNA knockdown sensitized the resistant melanoma cell lines to ER stress–induced apoptosis, which was
inhibitable by blockage of caspase-8 activation. Both
exogenous and endogenous ARC seemed to predominantly
locate to the cytoplasm and mitochondria and could be
coimmunoprecipitated with caspase-8. Taken together, ER
stress can potentially activate multiple apoptosis signaling
pathways in melanoma cells in a context-dependent manner.
Whereas the MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in inhibiting ER stress–induced caspase-4 activation, ARC seems to be critical in blocking activation of
casapse-8 in melanoma cells subjected to ER stress. [Cancer

Introduction
A number of cellular stress conditions, such as nutrient
deprivation, hypoxia, alterations in glycosylation status, and
disturbances of calcium flux, lead to accumulation and aggregation
of unfolded and/or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) lumen and cause so-called ER stress (1–3). The
ER responds to the stress conditions by activation of a range of
stress-response signaling pathways to alter transcriptional and
translational programs, which couples the ER protein folding load

ARC Protects Melanoma from ER Stress–Induced Apoptosis

Figure 1. ER stress–induced apoptosis of Me1007 cells is caspase-dependent. A, left, thapsigargin (TG ) or tunicamycin (TM) induces the ER stress response.
Whole-cell lysates from Me1007 and Mel-RM cells treated with thapsigargin (1 Amol/L) or tunicamycin (3 Amol/L) for indicated periods were subjected to Western
blot analysis of GRP78 expression. The data shown are representative of three individual experiments. Right, kinetics of thapsigargin-induced or tunicamycin-induced

caspase-2 inhibitior z-VDVAD-fmk (50 Amol/L), the caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk (20 Amol/L), the caspase-4 inhibitor z-LEVD-fmk (30 Amol/L), the caspase-8 inhibitor
z-IETD-fmk (20 Amol/L), or the caspase-9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk (20 Amol/L) for 1 h before adding thapsigargin (1 Amol/L) or tunicamycin (3 Amol/L) for a further 36 h.
Apoptosis was measured by the propidium iodide method using flow cytometry. Columns, mean of three individual experiments; bars, SE. C, whole-cell lysates from
Me1007 cells treated with thapsigargin (1 Amol/L) or tunicamycin (3 Amol/L) for indicated periods were subjected to Western blot analysis of caspase-3, caspase-4,
caspase-8, and caspase-9. The lower parts of the caspase-8 and caspase-3 graphs were obtained from the same membranes with longer exposure, respectively, to
better visualize the cleaved forms of caspase-8 and caspase-3. The arrow-pointed bands in figures for caspase-4 and caspase-3 are presumably either nonspecific
bands or intermediately cleaved capsase-4 and caspase-3, respectively. The data shown are representative of three individual experiments.

Small RNA interference. Melanoma cells were seeded at 3.5  104 cells
per well in 24-well plates and allowed to reach f50% confluence on the day of
transfection. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs used were
obtained as the siGENOME SMARTpool reagents (Dharmacon), the
siGENOME SMARTpool ARC (D-015682-00), and the siGENOME SMARTpool
caspase-8 (M-003466-01-04). The nontargeting siRNA control, SiConTRolNontargeting siRNA pool (D-001206-13-20), was also obtained from
Dharmacon. Cells were transfected with 50 to 100 nmol/L siRNA in OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) with 5% FCS using Oligofectamine reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s transfection protocol. Efficiency
of siRNA was measured by Western blot analysis 24 h after transfection.

mouse IgG1 mAb purchased from PharMingen, and rabbit IgG from Sigma
Chemical Co.
Apoptosis. Quantitation of apoptotic cells by measurement of sub-G1
DNA content using the propidium iodide method was carried out as
described elsewhere (12, 18). 4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining
was performed according to the manufacture’s instructions (Molecular
Probes) as described elsewhere (18, 19).
Confocal microscopy. Methods used were as described previously with
minor modification (20). Melanoma cells were seeded onto sterile glass
coverslips in 24-well plates (Falcon 3047; Becton Dickinson) for 16 to 24 h.
Mitotraker Red CMXRos (50 nmol/L; Molecular Probes) was added to the
culture medium for 30 min before washing cells with PBS, followed by
fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were then
permeabilized in 0.05% saponin diluted in PBS containing 10% human
antibody serum, followed by incubation with primary antibodies, which
were then detected with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated antimouse or
antirabbit immunoglobulin. Coverslips were mounted with SlowFade Gold
medium (Invitrogen), and confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM
510 scanner fitted to an Axiovert 100 M microscope. Dual-color analysis was
performed with appropriate single-color controls with individual channels
recorded sequentially. Instrument settings were adjusted to obtain minimal
saturated pixels, and the settings were kept constant on where
semiquantitative comparisons were performed.
Caspase activity assay. Measurement of caspase activities by fluorometric assays was performed as described previously (12). The specific
substrates z-DEVD-AFC, Ac-LEVD-AFC, and z-LEHD-AFC were used to
measure caspase-3, caspase-4, and caspase-8 activities, respectively
(Calbiochem). The generation of free AFC was determined using Fluostar
OPTIMA (LABTECH) set at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an
emission wavelength of 505 nm.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was carried out as
described previously (12, 18). Labeled bands were detected by Immun-Star
horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescent kit, and images were captured
and the intensity of the bands was quantitated with the Bio-Rad VersaDoc
image system (Bio-Rad).
Immunoprecipitation. Methods used were as described previously with
minor modification (12). Briefly, 100 AL of lysates were precleared by
incubation with 20 AL of a mixture of protein A and protein G Sepharose
packed beads (Santa Cruz) in a rotator at 4jC for 2 h and then with 20 AL of
fresh packed beads overnight. Twenty micrograms of anti-Flag M2 antibody,
anticaspase-8 antibody, or control immunoglobulin was then added to the
lysates and rotated at 4jC for 2 h. The beads were then pelleted by
centrifugation and washed five times with ice-cold lysate buffer before
elution of the proteins from the beads in lysate buffer at room temperature
for 1 h. The resulted immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE
and Western blot analysis.
Reverse transcription–PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells by
using SV total RNA isolation system (Promega). One microgram of
RNA was subjected to reverse transcription. PCR was carried out in a
two-step protocol using Moloney murine leukemia virus transcriptase
(Invitrogen) and Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) according to the
manufacturers’ instruction. The primer sequences for caspase-8 are
forward, 5-TGCCCTCAAGTTCCTGTGCTTGGA-3; reverse, 5-GGATGCTAAGAATG-TCATCTCC-3. Twenty-five microliters of mixture were used
for reaction, which contains 100 ng cDNA sample, 3 Amol/L MgCl2,
400 nmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 400 nmol/L primer mix, and
5 units/AL Taq DNA polymerase for 35 cycles with the annealing
temperature of 60jC.
Plasmid vector and transfection. The pcDNA3-ARC-Flag was kindly
provided by Dr G. Nunez (University of Michigan Medical School) and was
described previously (13). Melanoma cells were seeded at 1  104 cells per
well in 24-well plates 24 h before being transfected with 0.8 Ag ARC plasmid
in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) with 5% FCS using Lipofectamine
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s transfection protocol.
After transfection for 6 h, cells were switched to fresh medium for another
24 h. Cells were then passaged at 1:10 into fresh medium for further
24 h followed by selection G418 (Invitrogen).

Results
ER stress–induced apoptosis in the melanoma cell line
Me1007 is caspase dependent. Our previous studies have shown
that, in contrast to most melanoma cell lines that are resistant to ER
stress–induced apoptosis, Me1007 is highly sensitive to apoptosis
induced by the ER stress inducers thapsigargin and tunicamycin
(12). To further study the susceptibility of this melanoma line to
apoptosis induced by ER stress, we treated the cells with
thapsigargin at 1 Amol/L or tunicamycin at 3 Amol/L for varying
periods. The resistant melanoma line Mel-RM was used as a control.
Figure 1A shows that whereas thapsigargin and tunicamycin
induced rapid up-regulation of the ER chaperon GRP78 in both cell
lines, indicative of activation of the ER stress response, they only
induced significant apoptosis in Me1007 cells, which could be
observed by 6 h and peaked at 36 h after treatment. This difference in
sensitivities between the two cell lines was further evidenced in
assays with DAPI staining (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We examined involvement of caspases in ER stress–induced
apoptosis in Me1007 cells by treating the cells with the general
caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and specific inhibitors z-VDVADfmk against caspase-2, z-DEVD-fmk against caspase-3, z-LEVDfmk against caspase-4, z-IETD-fmk against caspase-8, and
z-LEHD-fmk against caspase-9, 1 h before the addition thapsigargin or tunicamycin. As shown in Fig. 1B, z-VAD-fmk and the
inhibitors against caspase-8, caspase-4, caspase-9, or caspase-3
inhibited thapsigargin-induced or tunicamycin-induced apoptosis
to varying degrees. In contrast, the inhibitor against caspase-2
exhibited only minimal inhibitory effects on thapsigargin-induced
or tunicamycin-induced apoptosis in Me1007 cells but blocked
apoptosis of MM200 cells induced by TRAIL, which was used as
a positive control for the caspase-2 inhibitor (Fig. 1B and data
not shown).
Consistent with results in assays with the caspase inhibitors,
Western blot analysis showed that caspase-8, caspase-4, caspase-9,
and caspase-3 were activated by thapsigargin or tunicamycin in
Me1007, but not Mel-RM, cells (Fig. 1C and data not shown).
Whereas activation of caspase-8, caspase-4, and caspase-3 could
be detected as early as at 6 h, caspase-9 activation could only be
observed at or after 24 h. Of note, the proenzyme of caspase-8 was
detected at very low levels in Me1007 cells before treatment
but was markedly induced by thapsigargin or tunicamycin.
Up-regulation of procasapse-8 by the ER stress inducers was not
observed in Mel-RM cells (data not shown). Activation of caspase8 and caspase-4 by thapsigargin or tunicamycin in Me1007
cells was also shown in fluorometric assays detecting activities
of the caspases by specific substrates in whole-cell lysates
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
Caspase-8 plays an important role in ER stress–induced
apoptosis of Me1007 cells. We tested if activation of capasse-8 or

Figure 2. Caspase-8 activation is critical in ER stress–induced apoptosis of Me1007 cells. A, the caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk inhibited activation of caspase-4
induced by tunicamycin or thapsigargin. Me1007 cells were treated with z-IETD-fmk (30 Amol/L) or the caspase-4 inhibitor z-LEVD-fmk (30 Amol/L) for 1 h before
adding thapsigargin (1 Amol/L) or tunicamycin (3 Amol/L) for a further 16 h. Whole-cell lysates were harvested and subjected to fluorometric assays for caspase-4 and
caspase-8 activities. The values of activity in the cells without treatment were arbitrarily designated as 1. The values of activity in cells treated with tunicamycin or
thapsigargin were compared with those in cells without treatment and are expressed as the fold increases. Columns, mean of three individual experiments; bars, SE.
B, siRNA knockdown of caspase-8 inhibits its expression. Me1007 cells were transfected with the control or caspase-8 siRNA. Twenty-four hours later, cells were
treated with thapsigargin (1 Amol/L) or tunicamycin (3 Amol/L) for 6 h. Whole-cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis of the expression of caspase-8 and
caspase-4. The arrow-pointed bands in figures for caspase-4 are presumably either nonspecific bands or intermediately cleaved capsase-4. The data shown are
representative of three individual experiments. C, siRNA knockdown of caspase-8 inhibits apoptosis (left ) and activation of caspase-8, caspase-4, and caspase-3 (right )
induced by thapsigargin or tunicamycin. Me1007 cells were transfected with the control or caspase-8 siRNA. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with
thapsigargin (1 Amol/L) or tunicamycin (3 Amol/L) for a further 24 (left ) or 16 h (right ) before measurement of apoptosis by the propidium iodide method using flow
cytometry or Western analysis of caspase-8, caspase-4, and caspase-3. Columns, mean of three individual experiments (bars, SE; left ) or representative of three
individual experiments (right ).

siRNA pool in the cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the caspase-8 siRNA
significantly inhibited up-regulation of caspase-8 by thapsigargin
but had no effect on the levels of capsase-4. Figure 2C
shows that siRNA knockdown of caspase-8 not only inhibited
thapsigargin-induced apoptosis but also blocked activation of
caspase-4 and caspase-3. Thus, activation of caspase-8 seemed
to be an initiating factor in ER stress–induced apoptosis in
Me1007 cells.
We studied the mechanism(s) by which procaspase-8 is upregulated by examining caspase-8 mRNA expression in Me1007

caspase-4 is an upstream factor in ER stress–induced apoptosis in
Me1007 cells by monitoring caspase activation in the cells treated
with the caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk or the caspase-4 inhibitor
z-LEVD-fmk, followed by the addition of thapsigargin or tunicamycin. Figure 2A shows that the caspase-8 inhibitor significantly
blocked activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-4, but the
caspase-4 inhibitor inhibited only caspase-4 activity with minimal
effects on caspase-8 activation.
To further confirm the role of caspase-8 in ER stress–induced
apoptosis of Me1007 cells, we silenced caspase-8 by a specific

before and after exposure to thapsigargin or tunicamycin. The
results show that caspase-8 mRNA seemed to be low in Me1007
before treatment, but after exposure to thapsigargin or tunicamycin, there was an increase in the levels of caspase-8 mRNA, which
could be detected as soon as 3 h and reached a peak by 6 h
(Supplementary Fig. S3). This suggests that caspase-8 in Me1007
cells could be up-regulated by ER stress at the transcriptional level.

Endogenously expressed ARC contributes to resistance of
melanoma to ER stress–induced apoptosis. To understand the
mechanism(s) by which ER stress–induced caspase-8 activation is
inhibited in most melanoma cell lines but not in Me1007, we
studied the expression of ARC in a panel of melanoma cell lines. As
shown in Fig. 3A, ARC was detected at varying but generally higher
levels in melanoma cell lines in comparison with those in

apoptosis induced by thapsigargin or tunicamycin. This was
associated with induction of caspase-8 activation as shown in
both Western blot analysis and fluorometric assays (Fig. 3C and
Supplementary Fig. S4). Figure 3D shows that pretreatment with
the caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk partially inhibited induction of
apoptosis by thapsigargin or tunicamycin in Mel-RM and MM200
cells with ARC being knocked down by siRNA.
Exogenous ARC inhibits ER stress–induced apoptosis in
Me1007 cells. To study if the high sensitivity of Me1007 cells to ER
stress–induced apoptosis is associated with the low levels of ARC
expression, we transfected cDNA encoding Flag-tagged ARC into
Me1007 cells (Fig. 4A). The levels of thapsigargin-induced or

melanocytes. Of interest, the levels of ARC in Me1007 seemed to be
the lowest among the melanoma cell lines. Figure 3A also shows
that exposure to thapsigargin or tunicamycin did not cause any
notable change in the levels of ARC in Mel-RM cells but resulted in
a moderate decrease in ARC expression in Me1007 cells that could
be observed as soon as 6 h after exposure to thapsigargin or
tunicamycin.
To study if endogenous ARC plays a role in protection of
melanoma cells from ER stress–induced apoptosis, we inhibited
ARC with a specific siRNA pool in Mel-RM and MM200 cells. As
shown in Fig. 3B, siRNA knockdown of ARC markedly inhibited its
expression in both cell lines and resulted in an increase in

against caspase-8 in the whole lysates from Mel-RM and MM200
cells before and after exposure to thapsigargin or tunicamycin. In
contrast, the ARC protein was not precipitated from whole-cell
lysates using the isotype-matched control mouse IgG (data not
shown). These results indicate that ARC can bind to caspase-8 in
melanoma cells.
ARC in melanoma is located to the cytoplasm and
mitochondria. We studied the subcellular localization of ARC
using confocal microscopy as shown in Fig. 5A. The endogenous
ARC in Mel-RM and MM200 cells stained with an anti-ARC
antibody seemed to locate to the cytoplasm, with a proportion of
the protein showing colocalization with mitochondria labeled with
Mitotracker. A similar distribution was shown for exogenous ARC
in Me1007 cells transfected with ARC-Flag and detected by the
anti-Flag M2 antibody. No nuclear staining pattern of ARC was
observed in the cell lines. Exposure to thapsigargin or tunicamycin
did not cause any notable change in the subcellular localization of
ARC (data not shown).
We confirmed absence of ARC in the nucleus and its mitochondrial localization in melanoma cells by Western blot analysis of
isolated nuclear and mitochondrial fractions in Mel-RM cells and

tunicamycin-induced apoptosis in ARC-transfected cells were
significantly decreased in comparison with those in vector alone–
transfected cells (P < 0.05, two-tailed Student’s t test; Fig. 4A). As
shown in Fig. 4B, thapsigargin-induced or tunicamycin-induced
caspase-8 activation was also reduced in ARC-transfected cells.
ARC is physically associated with caspase-8 in melanoma
cells. To understand the mechanism(s) by which exogenous ARC
protects Me1007 cells from ER stress–induced apoptosis, we
carried out immunoprecipitation using the anti-Flag M2 antibody
in whole-cell lysates from Me1007 cells transfected with Flagtagged ARC before and after exposure to thapsigargin or
tunicamycin. As shown in Fig. 4C, ARC, but not caspase-8, was
detected in protein complexes precipitated with the anti-Flag
antibody before treatment. In contrast, caspase-8 was readily seen
along with ARC in the precipitates obtained from cells treated with
thapsigargin or tunicamycin. The antibody M2-matched isotype
control mouse IgG did not produce precipitates containing either
ARC or caspase-8 (data not shown).
We next studied if the endogenous ARC was associated with
caspase-8 in Mel-RM and MM200 cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, ARC
was detected in caspase-8 complexes obtained with an antibody

ARC Protects Melanoma from ER Stress–Induced Apoptosis

ARC was identified as an endogenous CARD containing protein
that inhibits apoptosis by selectively binding to and inhibiting
caspase-8 and caspase-2, but not caspase-1, caspase-9, and
caspase-3 (13). It can also interact with Bax and inhibits its
activation and subsequently mitochondrial apoptotic events
(14, 15). In addition, binding of ARC with Fas and FADD has been
reported to play a role in inhibiting death receptor-mediated
apoptosis (14). However, most of these observations were made in
terminally differentiated cells, such as cardiac and skeletal
myocytes, and neurons, which were initially believed to be the
only cell types that express ARC (13–15, 21–26). It was not until
recently that ARC has been found to be expressed in various
human cancer cells (16, 17). The present study seemed to be the
first to show that endogenous ARC has a functional role in most
melanoma cell lines.
The levels of ARC expression in the apoptosis sensitive Me1007,
but not those in the resistant melanoma lines, were rapidly
decreased by treatment with thapsigargin or tunicamycin. This
suggests that removal of the inhibitory effect of ARC may be
required to ensure optimal induction of apoptosis by ER stress
(14, 24, 27, 28). In support of this, degradation of ARC by the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been reported to be an
initiating event in apoptosis induced by varying stimuli (27, 28).
Alternatively, the decrease in ARC may be a consequence of
induction of apoptosis. ARC was found to be phosphorylated at
Thr149 by protein kinase CK2 and that this was required to target
ARC to mitochondria (29). We found in this study that ARC in
melanoma cells was predominantly located to the cytoplasm and
mitochondria, but it is not yet known whether ARC is phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 in melanoma cells. The cytoplasmic
and mitochondrial localization of ARC in melanoma cells seemed
to be different from previous reports that showed ARC to be mainly
localized to nuclei in cancer cells (16). This difference may be due
to the different types of cells used in the studies.
Involvement of caspase-8 in the ER stress–induced apoptosis of
Me1007 was unexpected, as we have previously found that this cell
line lacks caspase-8 expression (30). The latter is a frequent finding
in neuroblastoma due to hypermethylation of its promoter (31).
Inhibition of caspase-8 by gene hypermethylation has also been
reported in some melanoma cell lines (32). However, whether the
same applies in the Me-1007 line is not clear. The rapid kinetics of
caspase-8 up-regulation may argue against demethylation of its
promoter as a cause (31, 32). This is supported by the finding that
there was no notable change in methylation status of caspase-8
gene in Me1007 cells before and after exposure to tunicamycin or
thapsigargin using methylation-specific PCR (data not shown).
Caspase-8 has been proposed to undergo autoactivation by
proximity-driven dimerization (33, 34). Overexpression of caspase-8 is also known to induce apoptosis (13, 33). It seems in this
study that, although caspase-8 was expressed in most melanoma
cell lines, it was bound to by ARC, which prevented it from
autoactivation. In contrast, the relatively low concentration of ARC
in Me1007 would presumably allow caspase-8, when induced, to
undergo autoactivation. However, there was no general correlation
of the relative concentrations of ARC and capsase-8 with sensitivity
to ER stress–induced apoptosis in the panel of melanoma cell lines
(data not shown). This suggests that factors other than ARC may
also operate to control caspase-8 activation in melanoma cells
subjected to ER stress.
Many other mechanisms have been implicated in the induction
of apoptosis by ER stress, such as CHOP-mediated up-regulation

Figure 6. A schematic illustration of mechanisms responsible for resistance of
melanoma cells to ER stress–induced apoptosis. ER stress can potentially
induce apoptosis by activation of caspase-4 and caspase-8 in melanoma cells,
which are, however, inhibited by GRP78 and ARC, respectively. Another
mechanism that may involve in induction of apoptosis by ER stress in melanoma
cells is activation of BH3-only proteins, which can be inhibited by antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members (36, 38). In addition, ER stress can cause calcium flux.
The latter is conceivably bound by ARC and GRP78 and prevented from inducing
apoptosis (9, 25). Question marks at the arrow points indicate that more
mechanisms may be found to involve in ER stress–induced apoptosis in
melanoma cells, and accordingly more resistance mechanisms are yet to be
discovered.

Me1007 cells expressing ARC-Flag. As shown in Fig. 5B, ARC was
observed in the mitochondrial fractions, but not in the nuclear
fractions from both cell lines. This further confirms the presence of
ARC in mitochondria but not in nuclei in melanoma cells.

Discussion
As reported elsewhere, most melanoma lines are resistant to ER
stress–induced apoptosis, although cultured melanocytes and
fibroblasts undergo apoptosis under the same conditions (12). It
was therefore of much interest that the melanoma cell line Me1007
was highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by the ER stress inducer
thapsigargin or tunicamycin. This led us to a closer look at the
mechanisms involved. In the present study, apoptosis of Me1007
cells induced by thapsigargin or tunicamycin seemed to depend on
activation of caspase-8 that in turn gave rise to activation of
caspase-4, caspase-3, and caspase-9 as shown by kinetic studies,
experiments with specific caspase inhibitors, and knockdown of
caspase-8 by siRNA.
Investigation of factors known to inhibit caspase-8 led to studies
on ARC, which was found to be expressed at relatively high levels in
most melanoma lines but was at low levels in Me1007 cells and
cultured melanocytes. Moreover, when ARC was transfected into
Me1007 cells, they became resistant to ER stress–induced apoptosis
and activation of caspase-8 was also inhibited. The more general
importance of the role of ARC in protection of melanoma cells
from ER stress–induced apoptosis was shown by siRNA knockdown of ARC in two typical resistant melanoma lines, which
showed that these cell lines became sensitive to ER stress–induced
apoptosis that was dependent on activation of caspase-8.
Immunoprecipitation studies clearly showed that both exogenous
and endogenous ARC was physically associated with caspase-8.
These results indicate that ARC is involved in protection of
melanoma cells against ER stress–induced apoptosis.

another adaptive mechanism by which melanoma cells are
protected from ER stress–induced apoptosis and suggests that
targeting ARC may improve treatment results of clinically
available chemotherapeutic drugs and those in development for
clinical use that can induce ER stress in melanoma cells, such as
cisplatin and sorafenib (39, 40).

of TRAIL-R2 and/or down-regulation of Bcl-2 (8, 35), up-regulation
of the BH3-only protein PUMA, Noxa, and Bim (36–38), and
activation of caspase-12 in murine systems and its counterpart
caspase-4 in human cells (4–6). The present finding that ER stress
induces apoptosis of melanoma cells by activation of caspase8 when ARC is deficient, along with our previous studies showing
that ER stress can induce apoptosis of melanoma cells by
activation of caspase-4 when the MEK/ERK pathway is inhibited
(12), indicates that ER stress can potentially activate multiple
apoptosis signaling pathways. Other mechanisms involved may
include calcium flux and activation of BH3-only proteins, such as
PUMA, Noxa, and Bim (9, 25, 36, 38). It is conceivable that
melanoma cells may have adapted to ER stress by inhibiting
multiple apoptotic pathways as illustrated schematically in Fig. 6.
The present study reveals that expression of the ARC protein is
