BACKGROUND: The incidence and spectrum of acute toxicities related to the use of bevacizumab (BVZ)-containing regimens in children are largely unknown. This report describes the adverse events in a recently completed large phase 2 trial of BVZ plus irinotecan
(CPT-11) in children with recurrent central nervous system tumors. METHODS: Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium trial-022 evaluated
the efficacy and toxicity of BVZ (10 mg/kg administered intravenously) as a single agent for 2 doses given 2 weeks apart and then
combined with CPT-11 every 2 weeks (1 course 5 4 weeks) in children with recurrent central nervous system tumors. Children were
treated until they experienced progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or completed up to a maximum of 2 years of therapy. Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Patients
who received at least 1 dose of BVZ were included for toxicity assessment. RESULTS: Between October 2006 and June 2010, 92
patients evaluable for toxicity were enrolled and received 687 treatment courses. The most common toxicities attributable to BVZ
included grade I-III hypertension (38% of patients), grade I-III fatigue (30%), grade I-II epistaxis (24%), and grade I-IV proteinuria
(22%). Twenty-two patients (24%) stopped therapy due to toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of BVZ and CPT-11 was fairly

INTRODUCTION
Although there have been many advances in the treatment of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors, there
remains a significant proportion of patients with refractory, progressive, or recurrent disease for which there are no known
curative options. In fact, pediatric CNS tumors still account for the highest morbidity and mortality among pediatric
malignancies.1,2 In an effort to improve outcomes, a variety of novel targeted therapies have been tested, including antiangiogenic agents.
Angiogenesis is defined simply as the development of new vasculature, and it is understood to be critically important
for several physiologic and pathologic states including tumor growth, invasion, and metastases.3-8 Vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and its isoforms are perhaps the most important mediators of tumor angiogenesis, are overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, and may be associated with tumor progression.9-12 In addition to its role in tumorigenesis, VEGF regulates many normal physiologic processes. It is crucial to angiogenesis during embryogenesis and
throughout childhood and adulthood, and it is a regulator of vascular permeability.13,14 VEGF plays an important role in
maintenance of blood pressure, wound healing, osteogenic differentiation, and maintenance of cells within the immune

and nervous system.14,15 VEGF is also involved in glomerular endothelial integrity and renal protein handling
under normal and abnormal physiologic conditions.16
Finally, there are preliminary data to suggest that VEGF
may be important in helping to regulate the coagulation
cascade.17 These normal physiologic processes regulated
by VEGF are important in understanding many of the
toxicities observed with anti-VEGF or VEGF-receptor
therapies currently in clinical use.
Blocking tumor angiogenesis has become an increasingly attractive modality for anticancer therapy. Although
there are many agents currently in use, bevacizumab
(BVZ) (Avastin; Genentech Corp, San Francisco, Calif)
has been widely studied in both pediatric and adult
patients since its development in 1997.5,7,18-24 BVZ is a
humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody
against all human VEGF isoforms and their proteolytic
fragments.25,26 VEGF inhibition due to BVZ results in
decreased vascular permeability, changes in interstitial
fluid pressure, more orderly blood flow due to pruning of
unnecessary blood vessels, decrease in the number of
tumor-initiating cells due to disruption of their perivascular niche, and an increase in chemotherapy delivery into
the tumor.27,28 However, the concomitant inhibition of
endogenous circulating VEGF results in a predictable pattern of toxicities that has been well characterized in adults
with recurrent solid tumors treated with BVZ or BVZcontaining regimens. The most common BVZ-associated
toxicities in adults have included fatigue, epistaxis, hypertension, proteinuria, hemorrhage, poor wound healing,
and thromboembolic events.1,29 Although children often
have unique patterns of toxicities as compared to their
adult counterparts, BVZ-related toxicities in smaller pediatric studies have been similar to what has been reported
in the adult literature.20,30-33 Here, we report the observed
toxicities in the largest cohort of evaluable children, to our
knowledge, treated on a phase 2 trial of BVZ plus irinotecan (CPT-11) for recurrent CNS tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium trial 022
(PBTC-022) was a phase 2 trial in children with recurrent
CNS tumors using a combination of BVZ and CPT-11,
in order to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of this regimen. There were 5 separate strata comprising malignant
glioma (stratum A), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (stratum B), medulloblastoma (stratum C), ependymoma
(stratum D), and low-grade glioma (stratum E). Efficacy
data for patients enrolled on strata A, B, D, and E have
been previously reported.34-36 Stratum C was prematurely

closed due to slow accrual. All patients initially received 2
doses of BVZ at 10 mg/kg intravenously given 2 weeks
apart. The first dose of CPT-11 was given within 3 days
after the second dose of BVZ. For patients not on
enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs, the starting dose
of CPT-11 was 125 mg/m2. This was increased in subsequent courses to150 mg/m2 if tolerated. For patients on
enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs, the starting dose
was 250 mg/m2, which was increased by 25 mg/m2 increments every 2 weeks to a maximum of 350 mg/m2 as tolerated. The dose of CPT-11 was adjusted as previously
reported based on hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities in subsequent courses.34,37 According to the protocol, patients who could not receive CPT-11 due to
toxicity were able to continue treatment with BVZ alone
in the absence of severe thrombocytopenia. BVZ was held
for any grade III or higher toxicity at least possibly related
to its use, and it could be restarted when toxicity had
resolved to less than grade II. CPT-11 was not given if
BVZ was held for toxicity. In general, patients were
required to come off therapy if BVZ was held for toxicity
and could not be restarted within 4 weeks. Toxicities were
graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
CTCAE, version 3.0. There were no dose reductions
allowed for toxicities related to BVZ. Any patient who
received at least 1 dose of BVZ was included for toxicity
assessment.
Because of some of the specific known toxicities
associated with BVZ use, there were routine surveillance
laboratory testss and imaging required prior to and at designated time points throughout therapy. Because proteinuria is a known toxicity seen in adults and small pediatric
series, it was required that urine protein be monitored by
urine analysis for urine protein:creatinine ratio both prior
to initiation of protocol therapy and every 4 weeks while
on treatment. If the urine protein:creatinine ratio was
greater than 1, protein excretion was quantified in a 24hour urine collection and BVZ held if urine protein was
greater than 3.5 grams (greater than grade III) and not
restarted until it decreased to less than a grade III. If BVZ
was held for greater than 4 weeks due to proteinuria, the
patient came off study therapy. BVZ was discontinued
and patients taken off study treatment if they developed
nephrotic syndrome (grade IV proteinuria).
Also, due to the possible deleterious effects of epiphyseal growth resulting from VEGF inhibition by BVZ,
patients were required to have a baseline radiograph of the
left knee if they had not yet achieved their full growth
potential.38 This was repeated every 12 weeks thereafter
during therapy or sooner if they had new symptoms of

musculoskeletal pain. If any abnormalities were detected
on routine radiographs following treatment, MRI scan of
both knees and/or the affected area were performed.
Finally, given that the risk and the potential morbidity and mortality associated with a CNS hemorrhage, any
evidence of a CNS hemorrhage (except very small punctate lesions) required that patients be taken off protocol
therapy. Routine susceptibility-weighted and gradientecho MRI sequences were required both prior to initiation
of therapy and with each routine surveillance MRI scan
throughout treatment.
RESULTS
Between October 2006 and June 2010, 97 patients were
enrolled on the PBTC-022 study. Two patients were

ineligible; 1 in stratum B and another in stratum D. Three
other patients were eligible but not evaluable due to withdrawal before beginning protocol treatment (Table 1).
Therefore, 92 patients were evaluable for toxicity and
received a median of 4 courses (range, 1-26; 687 total
treatment courses). The median age of all patients was
10.3 years (range, 0.6-20.1 years). The distribution of
patients among the 5 strata is shown in Table 1. The most
common BVZ-attributed toxicities included hemorrhage
(mostly epistaxis), hypertension, fatigue, headache, and
proteinuria (Table 2).
Hemorrhage occurred in 35 patients (38%) (Table
3); 22 patients (24%) had grade I or II epistaxis that was
self-limiting. There were also 10 patients (10.8%) with
grade I CNS hemorrhage, 2 patients (2.1%) with grade I

grade I-II) of systemic hypertension occurred in 35 (38%)
patients (Table 2), of whom 3 also had episodes of grade
III hypertension. Treatment of hypertension was at the
discretion of the treating physician, but patients demonstrated good control of blood pressure with antihypertensive treatment, and no patient was taken off study for this
toxicity alone. One patient, however, came off therapy
due to a combination of hypertension and grade III/IV
proteinuria. There were 63 episodes of mild to moderate
fatigue among 28 (30.4%) patients with only one that
worsened to grade III and required coming off therapy
(Table 2; Table 4). Headache was reported in 17 patients
Cancer

December 1, 2013

(18.5%). One patient with recurrent ependymoma (stratum D) was taken off treatment due to persistent grade III
headache following 11 courses of BVZ. There were 62
episodes of proteinuria among 20 patients (21.7%) with 4
episodes (among 3 patients) of grade III or IV proteinuria
(Table 2). All patients with grade III/IV proteinuria were
taken off therapy. Urine protein normalized over a period
of 2 to 3 months following cessation of BVZ therapy in
most patients. Three patients suffered cerebrovascular ischemia (1 grade II and 2 grades IV) while on treatment.
One patient was asymptomatic with only surveillance
neuroimaging findings of ischemia. Two other patients
presented with neurologic deficits including hemiparesis,
and ischemia was later confirmed on neuroimaging. All 3
of these children were taken off protocol therapy.
There were 3 episodes (1 grade I and 2 grade II) of
osteonecrosis among 92 patients (3.3%).39 These events
occurred in the lunate bone of the wrist (1 patient) and in
the femoral heads (2 patients), which are unique locations
as compared with the adult literature, where most osteonecrosis due to BVZ occurs in the jaw bones.39-42 All 3
children came off therapy.39 One patient (1.1%) suffered
a grade II vascular access-associated thromboembolism.
Although no patients had delayed wound healing while
on treatment, 2 patients with recurrent low-grade glioma
who required a laminectomy and a shunt revision for hydrocephalus, respectively, were taken off therapy for concerns regarding the potential risk of delayed wound
healing and were classified as off treatment due to “other
complicating diseases” (Table 4). Another patient came
off therapy at the “physician’s discretion” due to skin
ulcers and potential for poor wound healing. Twenty-five
(27%) patients came off treatment due to toxicity or physician discretion. This included 21 patients (23%) who
came off treatment due to BVZ-related toxicity, 3 patients
who came off due to “other complicating diseases/physician discretion,” and 1 patient who came off due to pancreatitis attributed to CPT-11 (Table 4). BVZ-specific
toxicities were evaluated over time in an exploratory fashion to assess if duration of BVZ exposure had an impact

on the onset or severity of any toxicity. Only the incidence
of proteinuria suggested a possible association with duration of BVZ exposure (Table 5).
Toxicities that occurred in this study that were probably related/attributable to CPT-11 included emesis
(55.4%; n 5 51, including 12 patients with grade III or
IV), leukopenia (46.7%; n 5 43, including 2 patients
with grade III), neutropenia (43%; n 5 40, including 13
patients with grade III or IV), diarrhea (42.3%; n 5 39,
including 5 patients with grade III or IV), and lymphopenia (40.2%; n 5 37, including 14 patients with grade III
or IV) (Table 2). As mentioned above, there was also one
incident of pancreatitis that was attributed to CPT-11,
requiring the patient come off therapy. There were no
toxicity-related deaths.
DISCUSSION
Bevacizumab is being increasingly used in both adult and
pediatric patients with cancer, often in the setting of recurrent disease and in combination with other chemotherapeutic and biological agents. The early reports of its toxicity
profile in children were described among a small group of
patients, and it is unclear if they depicted the true range and
frequencies of BVZ toxicities.20,31,33 Here, we present the
largest prospective cohort of children with recurrent brain
tumors treated with BVZ in combination with CPT-11.
The pattern of toxicities in this study is very similar
to that observed in adult patients treated with BVZ.1
4184

Even the rarer BVZ-associated toxicities seen in our pediatric cohort such as cerebrovascular ischemia (3.3%),
osteonecrosis (3.3%), and thrombosis (1.1%) have been
described in adult patients.15,41-45 It is possible that there
were other contributing factors that led to these adverse
events in our cohort. For example, 2 of the 3 patients who
developed cerebrovascular ischemia had previous radiation exposure which is a known risk-factor for vascular
occlusion and strokes in childhood cancer survivors.46 In
a phase 2 study of BVZ given concurrently with radiotherapy and temozolomide in adults with newly diagnosed
malignant glioma, a higher risk of CNS ischemia was
observed with a pattern suggestive of involvement of small
vessels, including lenticulostriate perforating arteries and
potentiation of radiation-induced occlusive arteriopathy.47 Similarly, exposure to steroids in 2 of 3 patients
with osteonecrosis and the presence of a venous access device in the one patient with a subclavian vein thrombosis
are known predisposing factors for these adverse events,
even in patients not receiving BVZ. The radiographic
findings of osteonecrosis do not differ when induced by
steroids versus BVZ, so distinguishing which agent caused
or contributed more to the abnormality is not possible.
More than a third of the patients with low-grade gliomas
who were enrolled on stratum E had longer exposure to
BVZ than did patients on the pediatric phase 1 study.48 It
is possible that this prolonged exposure to BVZ may have
led to more frequent toxicities in our population.48

Fatigue occurred in approximately 30% of patients,
but only one patient came off of study treatment due to
this toxicity. Interestingly, a recent report showed that 7
of 30 children developed new-onset hypothyroidism
requiring thyroid hormone replacement after initiating
BVZ, although many of these patients had previously
received cranial radiation as well.33 Unfortunately, this
toxicity was not well established during the time period
our patients were accrued and not routinely tested for, so
the extent that undiagnosed hypothyroidism contributed
to our patients’ fatigue is unknown.
Most CNS hemorrhages, although commonly
observed, were only mild and asymptomatic. These small
CNS bleeds may have been recognized more readily due
to the frequency of imaging and use of routine
susceptibility-weighted and gradient-echo MRI sequences
that demonstrate smaller hemorrhages more readily.49 In
the patient with the grade 3 subdural hematoma, the event
occurred approximately 3 weeks after the patient underwent a surgical procedure for the insertion of a vagal nerve
stimulator to control seizures. The patient’s scheduled
BVZ was held prior to this procedure; however, both the
BVZ and the procedure itself may have added to the
patient’s risk for bleeding. The risk of hemorrhage (all
locations) is increased in adult patients receiving BVZ. In
a meta-analysis, BVZ significantly increased the risk of
bleeding when compared with controls, and there was a
significantly increased risk for epistaxis or pulmonary
hemorrhage in patients with cancer who receive BVZ.50
The risk of a fatal hemorrhage was low, but patients with
CNS tumors were not represented in the analysis.50 The
risk of CNS hemorrhage is of major concern for pediatric
brain tumor patients who receive BVZ. Although bleeding occurred in 38% of our patients, the vast majority of
these hemorrhages consisted of self-resolving grade I and
II epistaxis. It is unclear if there is a significant increase in
intracranial hemorrhages in patients with CNS tumors
who receive BVZ.50 In a randomized study evaluating the
efficacy of BVZ alone versus BVZ plus CPT-11 in adults
with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, intracranial
hemorrhage was seen in only 2 of 85 (2.4%) patients
receiving BVZ alone compared with 3 of 82 (3.8%)
patients receiving BVZ plus CPT-11.19 Although it is theoretically possible that BVZ could increase the risk of
CNS bleeding in patients with brain tumors, it is unclear
if the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage is significantly higher than the inherent risk of this complication
in the CNS tumor population, especially in the context of
prior radiotherapy and/or progressive disease. Still, serious
intracranial hemorrhages must be considered a potential

BVZ therapy.
Hypertension and proteinuria were no more common in children than in adults, and hypertension readily
responded to antihypertensive interventions in most
patients. Both proteinuria and hypertension have been
reported as dose-dependent within the adult literature
and seen among 41% to 63% of adult patients treated
with BVZ.51,52 Although the exact mechanism of these renal toxicities is not fully understood, thrombotic microangiopathy has been described in some adult patients who
have undergone renal biopsies.53 Despite the high incidence of proteinuria, most cases are asymptomatic and
not severe, with nephrotic range proteinuria reported in
less than 10% of adult patients.52 Although rare in our series as well, grade III or IV proteinuria did occur, and all
grades of proteinuria seemingly occurred more often in
patients who received BVZ for a prolonged duration
(Table 5). Because of these risks, all patients receiving
BVZ should be monitored carefully with quantitative
urine protein measurements at least monthly during therapy in addition to routine blood pressure assessments.
BVZ is increasingly being used in pediatric studies
to treat children with CNS tumors and non-CNS tumors
alike, both in the upfront and recurrent setting. A better
understanding of its toxicity profile is essential to not only
inform patients and their families of the risks but also to
detect and treat adverse events in a timely fashion, thereby
preventing late sequelae. Our experience within the confines of this study shows that BVZ in combination with
CPT-11 was fairly well-tolerated, and most adverse events
were manageable and quite similar to those described in
the adult population.
