BACKGROUND: Esophageal adenocarcinoma is often considered to arise from a clonal stem-like population of cells,
which is potentially responsible for its poor prognosis. Transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) and Notch
signaling pathways play important roles in regulating self-renewal of stem cells and cell-fate determination. Both
pathways are frequently implicated in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. However, their contributions to esophageal adenocarcinoma remain unclear. METHODS: We evaluated TGF-b and Notch signaling components in normal esophagus, Barrett’s esophagus, and adenocarcinoma tissues and cell lines via immunohistochemical analysis and
immunoblotting; Hes-1 transcription was assayed using a Hes-1 luciferase reporter. RESULTS: We observed loss of
Smad4 (P<.05) and b2 spectrin (b2SP) (P<.01) in 5/10 Barrett’s esophagus and 17/22 adenocarcinoma tissue sections.
Concomitantly, dramatically raised levels of Notch signaling components Hes1 and Jagged1 occurred in adenocarcinoma tissues and cell lines compared with normal tissues. In normal esophagus, Oct3/4-positive cells are located in
the basal layer (2-3 per cluster), representing a pool of progenitor cells. We observed an expansion of this pool of
Oct3/4 positive cells in esophageal adenocarcinoma (15 per cluster). Furthermore, a panel of SOXs proteins documented for stem cell markers exhibit increased expression in tumor cells, indicating expansion of putative cancer
stem cells. Finally, we observed growth inhibition in BE3 cells with a c-secretase inhibitor, but not in SKGT-4 cells.
Unlike SKGT-4 cells, BE3 cells have activated Notch signaling with disruption of TGF-b signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Our
findings demonstrated a potential therapeutic value for targeted therapy in esophageal adenocarcinoma in the setC 2011

Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the world. It represents 1% of cancers diagnosed in
the United States, with an estimated 16,640 new cases reported in 2010.1 The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a
type of esophageal cancer, has risen at an alarming rate in the United States and other western countries over the last 30
years.2,3 Esophageal adenocarcinoma is thought to arise through multiple stages of carcinogenesis, including the replacement of the normal squamous epithelial lining with a columnar intestinal metaplasia, Barrett’s esophagus.4 Barrett’s
esophagus is likely to be secondary to the chronic acid and bile exposure in gastroesophageal reflux disease.5 Patients with
Barrett’s esophagus are at higher risk of developing esophageal dysplasia and subsequently, adenocarcinoma, at a rate of
approximately 0.5%-1% per year.6 The prognosis for patients presenting with advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma is
poor, with a 5-year survival of 0.9%.7 The clonal/stem cell origin of esophageal cancer may be a reason for its poor

prognosis. Molecular signatures, identifying the transition
from normal esophageal stem cells into cancer stem/progenitor cells, are of paramount importance for developing
new therapeutics.
TGF-b signaling is implicated in cell cycle control,
differentiation, and modulation of several cancers, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract.8-10 TGF-b signals
through activation of type 1 and type 2 transmembrane
serine/threonine kinase receptors (TBR1 and TBR2).
These receptors then recruit intracellular molecules,
Smad2 and Smad3, which further complex with Smad4.
We have previously demonstrated that b-2 spectrin (b2SP
[or embryonic liver fodrin]) provides the crucial adaptor
functions for Smad2/3-4 complex.11 The Smad2-3/4
complex then translocates to the nucleus to target downstream gene activation, such as the up-regulation of p21,
p15, p16, and RUNX3 and down-regulation of CDK4
and c-myc.12,13 There is some evidence of dysfunctional
TGF-b signaling in Barrett’s associated adenocarcinoma.
Low mRNA levels of the TGF-b type 2 receptor (TBR2)
have been reported in 27% of Barrett’s-associated adenocarcinoma,14 whereas loss of heterozygosity of Smad4
(chromosome 18q21.1) was found in 45% of cases.
Smad4 messenger RNA expression was progressively
reduced in the metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma
sequence (P<.01) and Smad4 promoter methylation was
found in 70% of primary Barrett’s adenocarcinoma samples.15 Impaired TGF-b and Smad4 signaling prevents
cell cycle arrest and promotes invasion in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells via increased expression of urokinasetype plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 through mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.16 Moreover, RUNX3, a target gene of TGF-b
signaling, has been shown to be down-regulated in Barrett’s-related adenocarcinoma.17 In addition, we have
found that deletion of b2SP, the crucial adaptor for
Smad2/3 and Smad4, resulted in a dramatic and spontaneous formation of liver and gastrointestinal cancers,
including esophageal cancer. These studies suggest that
loss of TGF-b signaling is an important factor in Barrett’s-related adenocarcinoma. Thus, although disruption
of TGF-b signaling has been observed, its modulators
(especially b2SP) are not clearly delineated in Barrett’srelated adenocarcinoma.
Notch signaling pathway is implicated in stem cell
self-renewal, cell-fate determination, and terminal differentiation.18,19 Notch signaling is active in hematopoietic
stem cells self-renewal in vivo and is down-regulated as hematopoietic stem cells differentiate.20 Aberrant activation

of Notch signaling has been reported in some hematological malignancies and multiple solid tumors.20,21 The basic
molecular players of Notch signaling are its ligands Delta
and Jagged and the Notch receptors (Notch 1 to Notch
4).19 Cells expressing Delta or Jagged bind with cells
expressing the Notch receptor, which results in the release
of an intracellular domain of the Notch receptor (ICN1)
by a cascade of proteolytic cleavages by both alpha and
gamma secretases. ICN1 then translocates to the nucleus
and complexes with CBF-1 and CSL. This complex further recruits transcriptional cofactors, converting it from a
transcriptional repressor to activator.22 Canonical Notch
signaling may then activate the repressor Hes-1, whose
function is to maintain the undifferentiated paradigm
that directly opposes the differentiating signals associated
with TGF-b induced p21 activation.23 Notch signaling
has been indicated in cancer development, however,
has not been well studied for Barrett’s-related
adenocarcinoma.
We and others have recently observed multiple gastrointestinal cancers including gastric and esophageal in
mouse mutants of the TGF-b pathway; the tumors potentially arise from a clonal population of dysfunctional stem
cells with activation of oncogenic events. In this study, we
provide evidence that Barrett’s-related adenocarcinoma
could result from a dysfunctional population of stem cells
arising from disrupted TGF-b and subsequent activation
of Notch signaling.

kind gift from Peter Rabinovich, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, Washington, and supplied by XiaoChun Xu, MD Anderson Cancer Center) were grown in
MCDB-153 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 20 ng/mL endothelial growth factor (Gibco, Grand
Island, New York), 140 lg/mL bovine pituitary extract,
5 lg/mL insulin, 5 lg/mL transferrin and 5 ng/mL selenium (Sigma), as described previously.26 As an untreated
solvent control, cells were exposed to DMSO (Sigma) at
a final concentration of <0.1%. For trypan blue exclusion
analysis, cells were treated with TGF-b and GSIXXI
for the indicated time, mixed with 0.4% trypan blue
(1:1), and examined with a light microscope for dye
exclusion.

Cell Proliferation Assays
Cell proliferation assays were performed using the CellTiter 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay
(MTS) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega, Madison, WI). SKGT-4 and BE3 cells were
seeded onto 96-well plates (3  103cells/well). Twentyfour hours later, the cells were treated with TGF-b and
GSIXXI at the indicated dose and time in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium. As an untreated solvent control, cells were treated with DMSO (for GSIXXI control)
or 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin in 4 mM HCl in 1
phosphate-buffered saline (for TGF-b control) (Sigma).
The medium and reagents were changed once at 72 hours.
All assays were performed in triplicate and were repeated
at least 3 times.

Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis
Total cell lysates were prepared in 2% sodium dodecyl
sulfate lysis buffer containing 330 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.8), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, and 1
mini-tablet protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana). The protein concentration of
supernatant was determined using the BCA protein assay
kit (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois). Equal amounts of protein
(70 lg proteins per well) were loaded and subjected to
electrophoresis on 10% or 12% Tris-glycine gels. Western
blot analyses were performed as described previously, and
immunoreactive bands were visualized by way of chemiluminescence detection.27

Transient Transfection and Luciferase
Reporter Assays
Hes-1 luciferase reporter28 was kindly provided by P.
Zhang, (MD Anderson Cancer Center). Plasmid was prepared using the Genopure plasmid midi kit from Roche
Diagnostics. Renilla Luciferase Control Reporter (pRLTK Vector) (Amersham-Pharmacia, Arlington Heights,
Illinois) was used to normalize transfection efficiency.
For transient transfection, Cells were seeded at a
concentration of 4  105 cells per well in 6 well plates. After overnight culture, the cells were transfected with DNA
(1 lg of Hes-1 luciferase reporter and 0.2 lg of Renilla
vector) mixed with 3 lL of FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were
harvested for measurement of luciferase activity via a dual
luciferase assay system (Promega) with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, California). The
values represent the mean and standard deviation of at
least 3 independent experiments.
Tumor Specimens
Archival formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human
tissues from esophageal adenocarcinoma, Barrett’s esophagus, and normal esophagus were obtained from the
Department of Pathology, Lombardi Cancer Center,
Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington,
DC. Additional normal squamous esophageal tissues were
obtained from the Department of Pathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center. The patient population included 38
patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma with varying
risk factors, representing different grades and stages of disease, 16 patients with Barrett’s esophagus, and 9 patients
with normal esophagus. The former group included
patients with earlier stage (stage 1) and localized disease
(stage 2-3) to encompass the different stages of esophageal
adenocarcinoma. All of the specimens were collected after
endoscopy, esophageal resection, or autopsy. Immunohistochemical labeling was performed as described
previously.29
All human tissue procedures were approved by the
institutional review boards at Georgetown University
Medical Center and MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Immunohistochemistry and Histology
Antibodies against b2SP (or embryonic liver fodrin),
Smad4, and TBR2; Notch pathway members Jagged1,
Hes1, CDK4, RUNX3; and embryonic stem cell marker
Oct3/4 were used to determine the expression of these
proteins via immunohistochemical analysis as described

previously.29 b2SP, Smad4, TBR2, and CDK4 labeling
was measured in 3 different grades: þþ, intense labeling;
þ, moderate labeling; and , loss of labeling.
Statistical Analysis
A global chi-square test was used to test the hypothesis
that the coefficient of each variable was equal to 0. Tissue
sample sets of immunohistochemical data were compared
to assess significance. P<.05 was considered statistically
significant, and all tests were 2-sided. All tests were performed with SPSS version 10.1 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Loss of b2SP, Smad4, and TBR2 Expression in
Barrett’s Esophagus and Esophageal
Adenocarcinoma: Loss of TGF-b Signaling
To determine whether impaired TGF-b signaling occurs
in esophageal adenocarcinoma, immunohistochemical
analysis was performed on 57 human esophagus specimens; 38 samples represented esophageal adenocarcinoma, 16 represented Barrett’s esophagus, and 9
represented normal esophagus. In normal esophageal mucosa, b2SP is highly expressed in the transit amplifying
population. In these cells, which have a high proliferative
potential before progressing to terminally differentiated
keratinocytes, b2SP is found to be strongly expressed in
both the nucleus and the cytosol (Fig. 1a). b2SP expression is diminished, however, in both Barrett’s and esophageal adenocarcinoma (P<.004) (Fig. 1b, 1c).
Furthermore, 60% of Barrett’s specimens and greater
than 70% of esophageal adenocarcinoma specimens demonstrate no nuclear b2SP staining (Table 1). Similarly,
Smad4 is universally expressed in the nucleus of transit
amplifying cells of normal esophagus (Table 1; Fig. 1d).
Meanwhile, 40% of Barrett’s and greater than 75% of
esophageal adenocarcinoma specimens demonstrated
weak or absent Smad4 staining (P ¼ .013) (Table 1; Fig.
1e, 1f). Interestingly, TBR2 was expressed in 100% of
normal and 57% of Barrett’s specimens with decreased
expression in esophageal adenocarcinoma (P ¼ .004) (Table 1; Fig. 1g-i).
Hes1 and Jagged1 Expression in Barrett’s and
Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: Activation of
Notch Signaling
To evaluate the activation of Notch signaling, expression
of Notch target Hes-1 was studied via immunohistochemical analysis. Hes-1 represses the transcription of tissue-

3694

specific transcription factors, thereby maintaining stem or
progenitor (transit amplifying) cells via inhibition of differentiation.21 In normal esophageal tissue, Hes1 was
strongly expressed in the basal layer (Fig. 2A-a). This finding is consistent with previous studies indicating that cellular proliferation is limited to the basal layer and that
migration to the suprabasal layers is associated with initiation of differentiation. Thereby, canonical Notch signaling is activated mainly in the basal layer to maintain the
balance of stem and progenitor cells. Interestingly, in Barrett’s specimens, Hes1 expression is localized to columnar
cells, and in adenocarcinoma, nuclear Hes1 expression is
nearly ubiquitous (Fig. 2A-c).
The Notch ligand Jagged1 expression is used to
localize canonical Notch signaling via immunohistochemical analysis. Jagged1 expression in normal esophagus is found in clusters of cells in the basal layer (Fig.
2A-d). In Barrett’s specimens, Jagged1 expression is
localized to columnar cells, whereas in adenocarcinoma
both nuclear and cytoplasmic labeling for Jagged1 is
observed, indicating the activation of Notch signaling
(Fig. 2A-e, 2A-f). To further confirm the activation of
Notch signaling in Barrett’s and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) cells, we determined the Notch signaling
components via immunoblotting and found markedly
increased expression of Hes-1 and a slight increase of
ICN1 in all EA cells compared with Barrett’s cells
(CP-A, CP-C); Jagged1 was absent in both CP-A and
CP-C Barrett’s cells but was expressed in 2 out of 4
cell lines (50%) (Fig. 3B).
To elucidate the transcriptional activity of Hes-1 as
consequence of activation of Notch signaling, the luciferase reporter of Hes-1 has been used to characterize the
transcriptional activity of Hes-1. Barrett’s and EA cell
lines were transfected with Hes-1 luciferase construct, and
their activity was determined after 48 hours. We found
that increased Hes-1 transcriptional activity in EA cells
compared with Barrett’s cells, (CP-A, CP-C), with the
most activity in BE3 cells (Fig. 2C), which may due to
dysfunctional TGF-b signaling. This further emphasizes
that esophageal adenocarcinoma overexpress the Notch
signaling pathway, thereby maintaining an undifferentiated phenotype.
Oct3/4 Localization Indicates a Continued
Undifferentiated Pool of Cells
Given the undifferentiated pool of cells seen with Hes1
and Jagged1 immunohistochemical staining, we next evaluated the potential source of these undifferentiated cells.

Figure 1. Decreased expression of transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) signaling components in BE and adenocarcinoma tissues
is shown. Immunohistochemical analysis of TGF-b members b2 spectrin (b2SP), Smad4, and transforming growth factor b type 2
receptor (TBR2) expression were performed in human normal esophagus, Barrett’s esophagus (BE), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (ACa) tissues using b2SP, Smad4, and TBR2 antibodies as described in Materials and Methods. b2SP expression is demonstrated in normal esophagus, Barrett’s esophagus, and adenocarcinoma (a-c). Smad4 expression is shown in normal esophagus,
Barrett’s esophagus, and adenocarcinoma (d-f). TBR2 expression is illustrated in normal esophagus, Barrett’s esophagus, and adenocarcinoma (g-i). Insets show the respective images at higher magnification (scale bar, 50 lM); original magnification, 25 lM.

We labeled cells for the embryonic stem cell marker Oct3/
4. The Oct4 gene has been noted as being specifically
expressed in embryonic stem cells and in tumor cells, but
not in cells of differentiated tissues.30 In normal esophagus, Oct3/4 expression is localized to the basal layer and
confined to 2-3 cells that occupy the center of the basal
layer invagination (Fig. 3A-a). Oct3/4 expression in the
normal esophagus specimens is consistent with previous
studies localizing an esophageal stem cell niche. In esophageal adenocarcinoma, however, larger and more diffusely

Cancer

August 15, 2011

positive Oct3/4 cells are observed. Interestingly, the
Oct4-positive cells are no longer confined to a cluster of
cells (Fig. 3A-b). In summary, in normal tissue Oct3/4 is
localized to the basal layer in 2-3 positive cell clusters,
whereas in adenocarcinoma it is present in more than
12% of the total cells. Moreover, the Oct3/4 expression
pattern is very similar to Hes1 expression in both normal
and cancer tissue. These similar expression patterns may
indicate that esophageal cancer cells are a product of aberrant esophageal stem cells.

In addition, a panel of SOXs proteins including
SOX-2, SOX-4, and SOX-9 has been documented for
stem cell or amplified cell lineage markers and are essential
for pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem
cells.31-34 Correspondent to the Oct4 staining in tumor
tissues, we found that SOX-9 is highly up-regulated in all
adenocarcinoma tumor cell lines compared to Barrett’s
cells, and SOX-4 also increased in certain extent in all adenocarcinoma cells, whereas 50% of adenocarcinoma cells
express SOX-2 protein, which has been reported as a lineage survival oncogene in lung and esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma31 (Fig. 3B). Expression of b-catenin is
increased in all adenocarcinoma cells as well (Fig. 3B).
These data indicate that there is expansion of aberrant
stem cells named cancer stem cells in adenocarcinoma tumor tissues and cell lines compared with normal tissue
and Barrett’s cells.
CDK4 and RUNX3 Expression: Functional
Consequence of Disrupted TGF-b Signaling
Given the tumor suppressor activity of TGF-b signaling,
we decided to evaluate the functional consequence of its
disruption and evaluate RUNX3 and CDK4 expression.
The functional ability of b2SP to translocate Smad2 and
Smad3 to the nucleus may modulate the Runt domain
transcription factor RUNX3, which is involved in TGFb-mediated cell cycle arrest by inducing the up-regulation
of p21cip1/waf.35 In normal esophagus, expression of
RUNX3 is well localized to the transit amplifying population of cells. In Barrett’s and adenocarcinoma specimens,
however, expression of this transcription factor is absent
(Fig. 4A-d-f). Meanwhile, CDK4, a cell cycle marker of
proliferation, is weakly expressed or absent in normal
esophagus (Table 1; Fig. 2A), but strongly expressed in

3696

35% of Barrett’s and 75% of esophageal adenocarcinoma
specimens (Table 1; Fig. 4A-a-c). The cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) inhibitors p15, p16, and p21 are known to
be regulated by TGF-b signaling.36 We questioned the
status of these CDK inhibitors in Barrett’s and adenocarcinoma cells as a consequence of dysfunctional TGF-b
signaling. As expected, P21, P15, and P16 were lost in
CP-A and CP-C Barrett’ cells and in most of adenocarcinoma cell lines (Fig. 4B).
Inhibition of Notch Signaling Using a
c-Secretase Inhibitor Suppresses Proliferation
of BE3 Cells But Not SKGT-4 Cells
Two human esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines, BE3
and SKGT-4, were used to assess the impact of inhibiting
Notch signaling on cell proliferation using the MTS assay.
The BE3 cell line is TGF-b-deficient, whereas the SKGT4 cell line maintains intact TGF-b signaling. After stimulation with TGF-b at 1 ng/mL, neither cell line exhibited
cell proliferation inhibition compared with controls (data
not shown). When treating both BE3 cells and SKGT-4
cells with different dosage of GSIXXI, dose-dependent inhibition was shown only in BE3 cells with high Notch signaling (Fig. 2C, 5B) but not in SKGT-4 cells (Fig. 5A).
These results suggest that deficient TGF-b signaling in
the presence of constitutively active Notch are necessary
for effective treatment with a c-secretase inhibitor.

DISCUSSION
Disruption of TGF-b signaling is an important factor in
Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Loss
of the tumor suppressor function of TGF-b signaling
through Smad4 in esophageal cancer has been described
previously as a cause of tumor progression due to the loss

of the transcription factor RUNX3, loss of p16/p21, and
gain of CDK4.17,37 Moreover, TGF-b signaling exhibits
functional synergism with Notch signaling in the regulation of Hes-1, a direct target of the Notch pathway.38,39
Both Notch and TGF-b signaling also converge to regulate the CDK4 inhibitor p21. In addition to the effects of

stem cell biology with opposing functions to Notch signaling. Whereas the TGF-b pathway is required for stem
cell differentiation, Notch maintains the undifferentiated

Notch signaling could give rise to cells that are unable to

lower Notch signaling. Results from this study may yield
important new therapeutic strategies and will be a first
step toward the goal of personalized cancer treatment
based on molecular characteristics in both TGF-b and
Notch signaling in this lethal cancer.
Our results suggest that the presence of a dysfunctional stem cell pool is due to the loss of b2SP/TGF-b
and activation of Notch signaling (Fig 6). Barrett’s esophageal adecarcinoma has been thought to be a result of clonal evolution. Previously, we observed that loss of TGF-b

signaling via loss of the adaptor protein b2SP and TBR2
could result in dysfunctional progenitor/stem cells giving
rise to hepatocellular carcinoma.44 Similarly, in esophageal adenocarcinoma, b2SP expression was shown to be
absent. TBR2, however, was expressed in >30% of adenocarcinoma specimens (Table 1). Thereby, disruption of
TGF-b signaling in esophageal adenocarcinoma appears
after TBR2 activation and likely involves b2SP and
Smad4. Down-regulation of Smad4 is due to several dif-

3700

ferent mechanisms, including methylation, deletions, and
protein modification.15 Meanwhile, RUNX3 expression
has been evaluated in esophageal adenocarcinoma cell
lines, and it was found that the restoration of RUNX3
expression via transfection was able to produce robust inhibition of cell growth.45 Moreover, b2SP/Smad4 double
heterozygous mice develop multiple gastric tumors with
E-cadherin/b-catenin complexes in gastric epithelial cells
of these mutant mice.46
Furthermore, the presence of larger pockets of
Oct3/4-positive cells in esophageal adenocarcinoma suggests that this cancer may be stem cell-driven. These cancer stem cells are likely characterized by dysregulated
TGF-b and Notch signaling. Moreover, in normal esophageal tissue, TGF-b and Notch signaling components
were strongly expressed in the transit amplifying region,
whereas stem cells were localized to the basal cell layer. In
adenocarcinoma, however, Oct4 expression became ubiquitous. A panel of SOXs proteins has been documented
for stem cell or amplified cell lineage markers.31,32 SOX-2
is an amplified lineage survival oncogene in lung and
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.31 SOX4 is involved
in murine embryogenesis and is significantly up-regulated
in ApcMin adenomas and human tumor cell lines.47
SOX-9 is a target gene of Wnt/bcatenin signaling, and its
expression marks a subset of CD24-expressing small intestine epithelial stem cells.32,48 We demonstrated that
expression of SOX-2, SOX-4, and SOX-9 are increased in
Barrett’s esophageal cancer cell lines, further indicating
the expansion of cancer stem cells in tumor cell lines. This
expansion of cancer stem cells is likely further stimulated
by the loss of TGF-b-mediated suppression, leaving a
population of immortal cells primed for progression
through the metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma cycle
of esophageal adenocarcinoma progression.
The current study demonstrates for the first time a
role for adaptor protein b2SP in esophageal adenocarcinoma via loss of TGF-b signaling and activation of
Notch signaling. Loss of b2SP/Smad4, resulting in the
disruption of TGF-b signaling, could contribute to the
activation of Notch signaling via Hes-1, a Notch signaling molecule (Fig. 6). The interplay between the TGFb and Notch pathway is critical in the transformation
of esophageal stem cells. Moreover, rescue of TGF-b
signaling by restoration of b2SP-Smad4 or Notch inhibition by c-secretase inhibitors in the setting of dysfunctional of TGF-b signaling could hold promise for new
personalized therapeutic approaches in esophageal
adenocarcinoma.

Figure 6. Changes of the expression patterns of transforming growth factor b (TGFb) and Notch signaling components in switch
from normal esophagus to adenocarcinoma are shown. (A) Different layers of normal esophagus are shown with corresponding
expression patterns of Hes1, Oct3/4, Smad4, b2 spectrin (b2SP), and RUNX3. (B) Loss of normal hierarchy of esophageal epithelium in adenocarcinoma is shown. Hes1, Oct3/4, Smad4, b2SP, and RUNX3 are not expressed in gradients as in normal tissue.
Whereas expression of Hes1, Oct3/4, and SOXs proteins increased, the expression of Smad4, b2SP, and RUNX3 decreased compared with normal tissue. (C) Model shows the interaction between Notch and TGFb signaling pathways in maintaining the hierarchy of esophagus epithelium.
