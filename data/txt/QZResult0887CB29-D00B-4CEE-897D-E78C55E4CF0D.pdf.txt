Abstract
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDI) have exhibited some efﬁcacy in clinical trials, but it is clear that their most
effective applications have yet to be fully determined. In this study, we show that HDIs inﬂuence the expression of
a common polymorphic variant of the chemotherapy drug efﬂux transporter ABCG2, which contributes to normal
tissue protection. As one of the most frequent variants in human ABCG2, the polymorphism Q141K impairs
expression, localization, and function, thereby reducing drug clearance and increasing chemotherapy toxicity.
Mechanistic investigations revealed that the ABCG2 Q141K variant was fully processed but retained in the
aggresome, a perinuclear structure, where misfolded proteins aggregate. In screening for compounds that could
correct its expression, localization, and function, we found that the microtubule-disrupting agent colchicine
could induce relocalization of the variant from the aggresome to the cell surface. More strikingly, we found that
HDIs could produce a similar effect but also restore protein expression to wild-type levels, yielding a restoration of
ABCG2-mediated speciﬁc drug efﬂux activity. Notably, HDIs did not modify aggresome structures but instead
rescued newly synthesized protein and prevented aggresome targeting, suggesting that HDIs disturbed trafﬁcking
along microtubules by eliciting changes in motor protein expression. Together, these results showed how HDIs
are able to restore wild-type functions of the common Q141K polymorphic isoform of ABCG2. More broadly, our
ﬁndings expand the potential uses of HDIs in the clinic. Cancer Res; 72(14); 3642–51. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC) are energy-dependent transporters involved in absorption, distribution, and
excretion of drugs and in cancer drug resistance (1). ABCG2
is a member of the G subfamily of human ABC transporters and
is a half-transporter that must dimerize for function (2).
ABCG2 transports numerous anticancer agents including
mitoxantrone, etoposide, topotecan, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (3). In addition, ABCG2 substrates include antivirals,
antibiotics, and toxins, highlighting the apparent role of
ABCG2 transporters in normal tissue protection, including
the blood–brain and maternal–fetal barriers. It has also been
observed that ABCG2 may play a protective role with respect to
exposure to smoke or dietary carcinogens (4, 5).

The most studied ABCG2 polymorphism is the nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C421A, which
results in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid
141 (Q141K), localized in the ATP-binding domain. C421A
allele frequency is high in the Japanese and Chinese population (26%–35%), whereas it is 10% to 12% for Caucasians and
less than 1% in the African population (3). ABCG2 harboring
Q141K has impaired protein expression, incomplete trafﬁcking
to the plasma membrane, and decreased function. Clinically,
the Q141K polymorphism has been linked to reduced clearance of some ABCG2 substrate drugs including diﬂomotecan,
irinotecan, topotecan, geﬁtinib, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, ﬂuvastatin, simvastatin, and sulfasalazine (6). In addition to its
impact on pharmacokinetics, the Q141K SNP has recently been
linked to at least 10% of all gout cases, as the decreased ABCG2
function reduces urate elimination (7).
Because of the clinical signiﬁcance of the Q141K polymorphism in anticancer drug pharmacokinetics and potential
involvement in carcinogenesis, we studied processing and
trafﬁcking of the intracellular trapped variant protein and
ways of rescuing Q141K ABCG2 to restore it to its wild-type
(WT) phenotype. Previous studies have shown that the defective folding and trafﬁcking of some ABC transporter variants of
P-glycoprotein (Pgp) or the cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) could be partially rescued by
ligands that act as pharmacologic chaperones to correct the

folding defect (8–11). These compounds function by promoting interactions between protein domains during folding. In
the same way, previous studies in our laboratory showed that
mitoxantrone, a substrate of ABCG2, had the ability to rescue
ABCG2 mutant protein (12). Here, we screened various compounds: mitoxantrone, the microtubule disruptor colchicine,
and 4 different histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. HDAC
proteins were ﬁrst discovered for their involvement in gene
regulation via histone deacetylation. It appears, however, that
HDACs have broader activities than expected and have been
shown, for example, to deacetylate various transcription factors or proteins involved in cell growth, death, or cellular
transport. In recent years, clinical development of HDAC
inhibitors (HDI) has emerged in cancer therapy, and several
classes of HDIs have been explored in preclinical models and
reached the clinic (13, 14).
We found that HDIs induced ABCG2 variant rescue and we
attempted to elucidate the mechanism of action of HDIs on
ABCG2 processing.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Flp-In-293 cells were obtained from Invitrogen. WT and
Q141K ABCG2 sublines were created by transfection of the
pcDNA5/FRT/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) expressing
WT or Q141K ABCG2 into Flp-In-293 cells, an HEK293 subline
bearing a single integrated Flp Recombination Target site
(Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cells were authenticated by STR-DNA technology (RADIL)
after establishment of different ABCG2 sublines and then
aliquoted and frozen. After being thawed, cells were cultured
in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 mg/mL Hygromycin B (Invitrogen), 2 mmol/L glutamine,
and 100 U/L penicillin/streptomycin (BioFluids).
Chemicals
Mitoxantrone and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma; panobinostat, vorinostat, and 17AAG from ChemieTek;
valproic acid from EMD4Biosciences; and tubastatin from
BioVision. Romidepsin was obtained from the Developmental
Therapeutics Program of National Cancer Institute (NCI)/NIH
(Bethesda, MD).
Immunoﬂuorescence
Immunoﬂuorescence was conducted as previously described (12), and the following primary antibodies were used:
anti-ABCG2 BXP-21 (Kamiya Biomedical Company); anti-giantin, anti-TGN46, anti-HDAC6, anti-g-tubulin, or anti-vimentin
(Abcam). Nuclei were stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and cells were visualized on a Zeiss LSM510
META laser scanning microscope (Zeiss), equipped with an
Apo63  1.4 oil DIC II objective.
RNA extraction and quantitative PCR
Isolation of total RNA was carried out with High Pure RNA
Isolation Kit (Roche). cDNA synthesis was conducted from 1 mg
RNA in a reverse transcriptase reaction using MMLV enzyme
and random hexamers (Invitrogen). cDNA ABCG2 was ampli-

ﬁed in a LightCycler Thermocycler by LightCycler TaqMan
Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics) and probes from Roche Universal ProbeLibrary. The expression levels of ABCG2 were
normalized with rRNA.
Western blot
Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies:
anti-ABCG2, anti-GAPDH (American Research Products, Inc.);
anti-BiP (BD Biosciences); anti-Hsp90, anti-Hsc70 (Stressgen);
anti-Hsp70 (Cell Signaling); anti-acetyl-histone H3 (Santa
Cruz); and anti-dynamitin (Abcam). Secondary antibody
(LI-COR Biosciences) was used to visualize quantiﬁable results
with the Odyssey System (LI-COR Biosciences).
Endo H and PNGase F assay
Cell lysates were incubated with N-glycosidase F (PNGase F)
or endoglycosidase H (Endo H; ProZyme) at 37 C for 3 hours
and immunoblotted.
Processing experiments
Cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37 C with 3 mmol/L
MG132 (EMD4Biosciences), 10 nmol/L baﬁlomycin, or 2
mmol/L 3-methyladenine (Sigma). Proteins were then
extracted and immunoblotted.
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry examining ABCG2 with anti-ABCG2 antibody 5D3 (eBioscience) was carried out as previously described
(12). Cells were analyzed with a FACSort ﬂow cytometer with
CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Transport studies were
conducted as previously described (12) with 200 nmol/L
BODIPY-Prazosin (Invitrogen) with or without 10 mmol/L
fumitremorgin C (FTC; Developmental Therapeutics Program
NCI/NIH), an ABCG2 inhibitor. The rate of cell death was
measured via Annexin V/PI assay (BD Pharmingen), according
to the manufacturer's protocol.
siRNA
Cells were transfected with untargeted siRNA or siRNA
against dynamitin (SMARTpool, Dharmacon), according to
the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 hours, immunoblotting
was conducted to determine the efﬁcacy of the knockdown.
Statistical analysis
The Student t test was carried out for each experiment
represented with a bar graph and asterisks indicate a significant difference (P < 0.05) compared with control.

Results
Determination of Q141K ABCG2 trafﬁcking
Flp-In-293 cells were selected for this study, as one copy of
the vector is known to insert at a unique speciﬁc site, resulting
in comparable RNA levels. To evaluate ABCG2 WT and Q141K
variant localization in cells, immunoﬂuorescent experiments
were carried out. As previously reported (15–17), we saw that
Q141K ABCG2 proteins had incomplete trafﬁcking and cytoplasmic retention, whereas WT proteins were mainly localized

in the cell membrane (Fig. 1A). Also noted was staining of large
aggregates of proteins, suggesting that the Q141K ABCG2
variant was accumulated in a localized cellular area.
Although Q141K and WT ABCG2 mRNA levels were equal,
variant protein levels were 4-fold lower, suggesting that a
posttranslational mechanism regulates expression (Fig. 1B).
Accordingly, the Q141K variant showed 5-fold decreased surface expression compared with WT.
We hypothesized that Q141K variant underexpression was
due to protein degradation. To explore whether Q141K ABCG2
was degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome, the endosome–
lysosome, or the autophagic pathways, we treated the cells with
the proteasome inhibitor MG132; baﬁlomycin A1, which inhi-

bits lysosomal degradation; and 3-methyladenine, which inhibits autophagosome formation. Baﬁlomycin and MG132 treatment increased total protein expression (between 150% and
180%) for WT and Q141K protein (Fig. 1C). These data suggest
that in normal processing, a small portion of WT and Q141K
ABCG2 are degraded via the proteasomal pathway, whereas
the fully processed proteins that reach the surface are degraded
by the lysosome, as observed for other transmembrane proteins (18). Interestingly, the inhibition of the autophagic pathway induced a 3-fold increase in Q141K ABCG2 levels but
barely affected WT protein expression. This indicates that
autophagy is the main posttranslational mechanism, leading
to a loss of Q141K variant expression. To support this

HDI Impact on the Expression and Trafﬁcking of Q141K ABCG2

conclusion, we induced autophagy by starvation or rapamycin
and observed a further decrease in variant levels after 16- and
24-hour treatments (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also observed
that a higher proportion of Q141K variant is ubiquitinated than
in the WT protein (Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, whereas
ABCG2 is ubiquitinated when it is targeted to the proteasome,
it is not when it is targeted to the autophagosome.
To examine the processing of Q141K ABCG2, whole-cell
lysates from Flp-In-293 cells were deglycosylated with PNGase
F and Endo H. ABCG2 contains a polysaccharide chain on
asparagine 596 (19). PNGase F removes these glycans at any
stage of processing, whereas Endo H cleaves immature oligosaccharides. No change in molecular mass was observed after
Endo H digestion (Fig. 1D), suggesting that both WT and
Q141K ABCG2 were completely processed and not retained
in the endoplasmic reticulum.
We next evaluated the localization of the retained ABCG2
variant in Flp-In-293 cells by immunoﬂuorescent colocalization experiments. Two Golgi markers were used: giantin, a cis/
medial Golgi marker, and TGN46, a trans-Golgi network marker (20). Results showed that Q141K was not retained in Golgi
(Fig. 1E). We then asked whether Q141K ABCG2 proteins were
retained in aggresomes. These structures, localized around the
centrosome, are inclusion bodies where misfolded proteins
aggregate (21). In Fig. 1F, we observed that the intracellularretained ABCG2 variant was mainly localized around g-tubulin, a centrosome marker, a ﬁnding consistent with localization
in the aggresome (22). Thus, the major fraction of Q141K
variant accumulated in the aggresomes. While WT ABCG2
was mainly on the membrane, it was also discernable in the
aggresome.
Together, these results indicated that WT ABCG2 was
normally processed and mainly localized in the cytoplasmic
membrane, whereas a small fraction underwent proteasome
degradation or entrapment in the aggresome. The Q141K
ABCG2 variant reached its mature form but was mainly
sequestered in the aggresome and degraded via autophagy.
A small fraction of variant also reached the surface or underwent proteasomal degradation.
Impact of mitoxantrone on ABCG2 protein expression
and localization
Studies in CFTR or Pgp have identiﬁed compounds that
act as pharmacologic chaperones to promote folding and
trafﬁcking of mature proteins to the cell surface (8–11). We
previously showed that mitoxantrone increased the processing
of an ABCG2 mutant (12). The effects of mitoxantrone were
thus assayed in Q141K ABCG2 variant trafﬁcking. We ﬁrst
determined whether mitoxantrone exposure induced ABCG2
expression in Flp-In-293 cells by using quantitative PCR,
immunoblotting, and ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Treatment with
5 mmol/L mitoxantrone for 24 hours caused a small increase in
WT and Q141K total ABCG2 expression (around 125% for
mRNA and 120% for protein compared with untreated cells).
Surface expression showed a 160% induction in WT cells and a
250% induction in Q141K cells (Fig. 2A). The subcellular
localization of ABCG2 following mitoxantrone was evaluated
by immunoﬂuorescent confocal microscopy. Q141K variant

www.aacrjournals.org

showed a marked homogeneous staining pattern, with loss of
aggresome localization, whereas Flp-In-293 WT cells showed
no change (Fig. 2B). Finally, ABCG2 net efﬂux was determined
by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in Flp-In-293
WT and Q141K cells after mitoxantrone treatment (Fig. 2C).
Pretreatment with mitoxantrone for 24 hours caused a weak
increase of substrate net efﬂux (113% and 128% for WT and
Q141K ABCG2, respectively).
Taken together, these results suggested that mitoxantrone
stopped variant aggresome targeting, but recruitment to the
cell surface was still incomplete.
Impact of HDIs on ABCG2 protein expression,
localization, and function
We previously reported the ability of HDIs to increase
ABCG2 mRNA levels (23, 24). Four HDIs were evaluated for
their impact on ABCG2 expression and processing. Romidepsin affects primarily class I HDACs, whereas panobinostat,
vorinostat, and valproic acid are more broad-spectrum HDIs
(13). We ﬁrst determined the effect of HDIs on ABCG2 mRNA
and protein expression in the ABCG2 Flp-In-293 sublines
treated for 24 hours with 46 nmol/L romidepsin, 100 nmol/
L panobinostat, 10 mmol/L vorinostat, or 1 mmol/L valproic
acid (Fig. 3A). Following treatment with romidepsin, panobinostat, and vorinostat, ABCG2 mRNA levels showed a 250% to
350% increase, presumably due to transcriptional regulation
following altered histone acetylation (23). Total and surface
protein expressions were similarly increased (210%–310% for
WT ABCG2 and 260%–375% for Q141K ABCG2). Valproic acid
induced the weakest effect on mRNA and protein ABCG2
expression (150%–200% increase). The same experiments carried out in mock Flp-In-293 cells showed that endogenous
ABCG2 was not expressed, even after HDI treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3), assuring that we only studied the transfected
ABCG2.
Localization of ABCG2 was examined by confocal microscopy after HDI treatment. Again, basal plasma membrane
localization of WT far exceeded that in Flp-In-293 Q141K cells,
where ABCG2 was localized in aggresomes (Fig. 3B). After
exposure to HDIs, WT ABCG2 showed a minimal change in
localization, whereas a dramatic change was seen for Q141K
ABCG2. Panobinostat, vorinostat, and especially romidepsin
induced a signiﬁcant decrease in ABCG2 inside the cell and
increased staining along the cell surface. In Fig. 3C, we
observed in detail that in romidepsin-treated Flp-In-293
Q141K cells, the aggresome-localized ABCG2 had almost disappeared in favor of a strong surface localization. ABCG2speciﬁc efﬂux was then determined by FACS after HDI treatment in Flp-In-293 WT and Q141K cells. In Flp-In-293 WT cells,
24-hour HDI pretreatment led to a weak increase of substrate
net efﬂux compared with untreated cells (110%–120%). However, the change in transport ability following exposure to the
HDIs in Flp-In-293 Q141K cells was notably higher: 200% for
romidepsin, 163% for panobinostat, and 210% for vorinostat,
compared with untreated Flp-In-293 Q141K cells (Fig. 3D).
Increased Q141K ABCG2 function was conﬁrmed by a cell
death assay using the ABCG2 substrate, pheophorbide A (Fig.
3E). Indeed, Flp-In-293 Q141K cells pretreated for 24 hours with

romidepsin showed a decrease in cell death after pheophorbide
A treatment compared with cells not pretreated. Notably, it
appears that WT is also rendered more efﬁcient after HDI
treatment in the cell death assay, although the efﬂux assay
was not sufﬁciently sensitive to detect this increasing WT
ABCG2 efﬂux (saturating levels).
Altogether, these results indicate that romidepsin, vorinostat, and panobinostat induced an increase in WT and Q141K
ABCG2 expression that was associated with an improved
trafﬁcking to the cell surface in the Q141K variant. The increase
also came with a gain of Q141K ABCG2 function, indicating
that the surface variant was functional.
Transcriptional effects of HDIs on Q141K ABCG2 rescue
Our goal was to determine the mechanism by which HDI
treatment leads to improvement of ABCG2 mutant trafﬁcking.
We ﬁrst determined whether the increased ABCG2 expression
on the cell surface required new protein synthesis. We treated
cells simultaneously with HDIs and cycloheximide, an inhibitor
of protein biosynthesis. We veriﬁed that cycloheximide does
not affect the histone and a-tubulin acetylation, induced by
HDIs (Supplementary Fig. S4). We then observed, in both FlpIn-293 WT and Q141K cells, that the mitoxantrone- and HDIinduced increases in surface expression were abolished by

inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 4A), and the same results
were obtained with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D
(Supplementary Fig. S5). These experiments indicated that
HDI- and mitoxantrone-induced rescue require transcription
events. Whereas mitoxantrone did not induce increased protein expression, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
abrogated the mitoxantrone-induced variant surface increase.
This suggests that mitoxantrone only modiﬁed the trafﬁcking
of the neosynthesized ABCG2 and would not act on Q141K
ABCG2 already trapped in the aggresome.
We also monitored the effect of romidepsin on mRNA and
surface expression of ABCG2 over time. We observed that the
drug-induced increase in mRNA expression of the 2 proteins
was only detectable after 12 hours, and that the increased
ABCG2 surface expression appeared subsequently, after 16
hours of treatment (Fig. 4B). These results support the conclusion that the transporter cell surface rescue was more likely
due to a gene transcription–related event than to a direct
acetylation-induced cytoplasmic event.
We compared the data from mitoxantrone and HDI effect
on Q141K ABCG2 localization and function. We noted that
mitoxantrone induced a relocalization of the variant in a
homogeneous cytoplasmic pattern and weakly on the plasma
membrane, linked to a weak increase in ABCG2 function. HDIs

induced mainly Q141K ABCG2 trafﬁcking to the membrane,
accompanied by a greater increase in protein function. From
these results, we hypothesized that HDIs induced not only
ABCG2 expression but also genes encoding proteins that
enhanced ABCG2 folding and/or trafﬁcking.
To ﬁnd an ABCG2-folding partner, we focused on chaperone
protein expression after 24-hour HDI treatment. We did not
observe changes in Bip, Hsc70, Hsp70, or Hsp90 expression
(Supplementary Fig. S6), suggesting that HDI-mediated correction of trafﬁcking cannot be ascribed to induction of these
chaperones.
Nontranscriptional mechanisms of HDIs inducing
Q141K ABCG2 rescue
Considering ABCG2 acetylation as a possible mechanism of
rescue, we immunoprecipitated ABCG2 and immunoblotted
for acetylated lysine but saw no effect of HDIs on the transporter acetylation state (data not shown).

Q141K

We observed that Q141K ABCG2 was retained in aggresomes. The formation of aggresomes begins with the coalition
of small, unfolded protein aggregates, which are dispersed in
the periphery of the cytoplasm and travel on microtubules
toward the microtubule-organizing center region. There they
remain as stable particulate structures entangled with intermediate ﬁlaments such as vimentin, until degradation by
autophagy or by the proteasome (21). In several models,
HDAC6 has also been involved in retrograde transport by
binding both misfolded proteins and the motor protein dynein,
which then transports the misfolded protein-HDAC6 complexes toward aggresomes by traveling along microtubules
(21, 25, 26).
We asked whether HDIs disturbed aggresome maintenance.
In Fig. 5A, we observed that the microtubule-organizing center
(centrosome) and vimentin were not disrupted by exposure to
romidepsin, indicating maintenance of the aggresome
structure.

We then asked how HDIs could disturb retrograde transport.
To evaluate HDAC6 involvement in Q141K ABCG2 rescue, we
treated Flp-In-293 Q141K cells with the HDAC6 inhibitor
tubastatin (28). In Fig. 5D, we observed that the HDAC6
inhibition observed after 24-hour treatment with 2.5 mmol/L
tubastatin did not induce ABCG2 variant rescue. Moreover,
cotreatment of tubastatin with romidepsin (class I HDI) did
not induce an additional effect. No change was expected with
the other HDIs, knowing that they already inhibit HDAC6. We
concluded that HDAC6 inhibition was not involved in variant
rescue. We then evaluated the involvement of the motor
protein complex in ABCG2 rescue. It has been shown that
overexpression of dynamitin induces the disruption of dynein
from microtubules, leading to abrogation of aggresome formation (29). We studied dynamitin expression after HDI
treatment and observed that romidepsin, panobinostat, and
vorinostat, but not valproic acid, induced dynamitin overexpression (Fig. 5E). Knowing that valproic acid is the only
HDI that does not induce ABCG2 rescue, these results suggest
that HDIs might inhibit ABCG2 retrograde transport via dissociation of dynein from microtubules, due to dynamitin
overexpression. To conﬁrm these data, we conducted an siRNA
assay to inhibit the expression of dynamitin, and we assessed
the effect of HDIs on ABCG2 Q141K rescue after dynamitin
knockdown. As shown in Fig. 5F, dynamitin knockdown
blunted the effect of HDIs on Q141K ABCG2 rescue with a
signiﬁcant effect for romidepsin.

We next examined the role of microtubules, known to be
involved in retrograde transport, in ABCG2 localization. A
previous study has shown that romidepsin did not alter the
microtubule structure (27), but it is possible that HDIs
disturb the trafﬁcking along microtubules. To study the
involvement of microtubule retrograde transport in ABCG2
rescue, we used colchicine, a microtubule polymerization
inhibitor. Surprisingly, immunoﬂuorescent experiments
showed that colchicine induced a dispersion of the ABCG2
variant aggregates and a relocalization of ABCG2 to the
surface (Fig. 5B), much as observed with HDI treatment.
Total ABCG2 expression was unchanged after colchicine
treatment (Fig. 5C). On the basis of the colchicine results,
we concluded that HDI-induced ABCG2 rescue could
also involve inhibition of retrograde transport along
microtubules.

We saw that the Q141K variant was retained in aggresomes
and then degraded by the autophagic pathway. The aggresome
was discovered by Johnston and colleagues (21) as a cellular
area where misfolded undegraded CFTR molecules accumulate. They proposed that aggresome formation was a general
response of cells, occurring when proteasome capacity is
exceeded by misfolded protein production. Aggresome formation facilitates the capture of aggregated proteins by the
autophagic pathway (30–33), which we observed to be the case
for Q141K ABCG2. A previous study had shown in the same
Flp-In-293 cell model that Q141K ABCG2 was subjected to
ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal and lysosomal degradation,
with a 2-fold increase in expression after treatment with both
inhibitors (17). We also found that a fraction of ABCG2 variant
was degraded via the proteasome and lysosome, with a 1.8- to
1.9-fold increase after inhibition. The authors concluded that it
undergoes lysosomal and proteasomal degradations but did
not explore the possibility of an autophagic pathway.
It is interesting to note that the expressed WT and Q141K
ABCG2 variants are found in a fully mature form, contrary to
what has been observed with other ABC transporters. For
example, CFTR with the DF508 deletion results in a defectively
folded protein that fails to mature and is rapidly degraded (34,
35). In the same way, only WT Pgp is processed in mature form,
whereas some mutants are intracellularly retained in an
immature form (36).
We sought to rescue Q141K ABCG2 trafﬁcking using HDIs.
The HDIs induced ABCG2 mRNA, total, and surface protein

expression with a conserved ratio for WT as for Q141K variant.
More importantly, HDIs caused a strong relocalization of the
Q141K variant from aggresome to cell surface and increased
Q141K-mediated efﬂux. We sought to understand why these
HDI-induced Q141K proteins, instead of accumulating in the
aggresomes, were able to trafﬁc to the cell surface. The rescue
by the HDIs required protein neosynthesis and an approximate
16-hour delay. As suggested for mitoxantrone, these results
imply that HDIs improve neosynthesized transporter folding
rather than affecting the already aggresome-trapped variant.
They also implicate an increase in trafﬁcking mechanisms via
transcription regulation rather than by a more immediate
signaling or acetylation event. We observed that dynamitin
was overexpressed, probably leading to the inhibition of retrograde transport via the disruption of dynein from microtubules. The partial inhibition of the HDI effect on ABCG2
rescue after dynamitin knockdown suggested that inhibition of
retrograde transport is a part of HDI mechanism of action.

Other proteins involved in protein folding or trafﬁcking might
also be regulated. For example, Hutt and colleagues (37) have
shown that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)-induced
rescue of CFTR variant was also mainly due to gene transcription regulation. Interestingly, they showed, by siRNA screen of
all class I and II HDACs, that inhibition of HDAC7 restored
CFTR trafﬁcking and activity on cell surface. HDAC7 regulated
a set of genes involved in CFTR folding, maturation, trafﬁcking,
and channel activation. HDAC1 inhibition also restored CFTR
variant trafﬁcking but not its function.
We observed that colchicine was also able to rescue Q141K
ABCG2 trafﬁcking. This drug, which inhibits microtubule
polymerization, is already known to disrupt aggresome formation and retrograde transport (38). We deduced that HDIs
similarly inhibit Q141K retrograde transport toward the aggresome, likely via dynamitin overexpression. HDIs might also
directly inhibit HDACs involved in retrograde transport. For
example, Kim and colleagues (39) recently showed that during

an inﬂammatory stimulus, HDAC1 competed with the adaptor
proteins for binding to motor proteins that travel along the
microtubules, impairing axonal transport in neurons. This
suggests a new role for HDAC1 in protein trafﬁcking. Nawrocki
and colleagues (40) also showed that inhibition of HDAC6 led
to disruption of the aggresomes, but our experiments suggested that this deacetylase was not involved in the Q141K
ABCG2 rescue.
On the basis of our results, we propose a multipathway
mechanism for HDI-induced Q141K ABCG2 rescue to surface
(Fig. 6). HDIs induced Q141K ABCG2 surface localization by an
increase in ABCG2 transcription coupled to dynamitin overexpression, which reduced aggresome targeting by inhibition
of dynein/microtubule retrograde transport. Other protein
partners might also improve the neosynthesized variant folding and trafﬁcking, as observed with the CFTR variant (37).
HDIs are promising anticancer agents. They were initially
thought to simply reverse aberrant epigenetic changes associated with cancer, but it was soon observed that the inhibition
of HDAC activity led to pleiotropic activities via various cellular
and molecular pathways. These broad effects make it difﬁcult
to identify the key molecular events that determine the biologic
response to HDIs. Here, we highlighted a new molecular
mechanism, HDIs acting as modulators of protein trafﬁcking.
The use of molecules acting as "correctors" of variant protein
processing and "potentiators" of variant protein activity, largely
developed in vitro, has just shown its ﬁrst clinical success.
Ramsey and colleagues (41) observed in a phase III clinical trial
that the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor, used to treat CFTR variant
carriers, was associated with a sustained 17% relative improvement in lung function. These successful results highlight the
potential of this emerging treatment strategy in the clinic and
open doors to a new use of HDIs as ABCG2-defective variant

this study offers insights into the processing of a protein of
