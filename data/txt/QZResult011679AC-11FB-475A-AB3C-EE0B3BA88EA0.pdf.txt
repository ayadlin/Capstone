ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal malignancy with high mortality and
poor prognosis. Oncogenic transcription factor Late SV40 Factor (LSF) plays an
important role in promoting HCC. A small molecule inhibitor of LSF, Factor Quinolinone
Inhibitor 1 (FQI1), significantly inhibited human HCC xenografts in nude mice
without harming normal cells. Here we evaluated the efficacy of FQI1 and another
inhibitor, FQI2, in inhibiting endogenous hepatocarcinogenesis. HCC was induced in
a transgenic mouse with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of c-myc (Alb/c-myc)
by injecting N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) followed by FQI1 or FQI2 treatment after
tumor development. LSF inhibitors markedly decreased tumor burden in Alb/c-myc
mice with a corresponding decrease in proliferation and angiogenesis. Interestingly,
in vitro treatment of human HCC cells with LSF inhibitors resulted in mitotic arrest
with an accompanying increase in CyclinB1. Inhibition of CyclinB1 induction by
Cycloheximide or CDK1 activity by Roscovitine significantly prevented FQI-induced
mitotic arrest. A significant induction of apoptosis was also observed upon treatment
with FQI. These effects of LSF inhibition, mitotic arrest and induction of apoptosis by
FQI1s provide multiple avenues by which these inhibitors eliminate HCC cells. LSF
inhibitors might be highly potent and effective therapeutics for HCC either alone or
in combination with currently existing therapies.

in the incidence of HCC, especially in the US [2]. This
problem is compounded by the fact that HCC is a disease
with very poor prognosis with only 10% of patients
having 5 year mean survival rate using currently available
treatments [3]. The only FDA-approved drug, sorafenib,
for non-resectable HCC provides a survival benefit of

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the five
most common malignancies and the third leading cause
of cancer related deaths worldwide [1]. Despite a decline
in overall cancer incidence, there is a steady increase

only 2.8 months [4]. As such there is an urgent need for
developing new molecular targeted therapy for HCC.
We previously identified overexpression of the
transcription factor Late SV40 factor (LSF) in ~90% of
human HCC patients which could be significantly correlated
with the stages of the disease and ‘gain-of-function’ and
‘loss-of-function’ studies established the significance of LSF
in promoting hepatocarcinogenesis [5–9]. Furthermore, LSF
positively regulates all the major hallmarks of cancer in HCC.
First, LSF transcriptionally regulates osteoponin (OPN) in
HCC, which activates c-Met signaling, thereby mediating the
oncogenic function of LSF and promoting metastasis [5, 6].
Second, we identified matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
as a target gene of LSF, important for mediating LSF-induced
angiogenesis [8]. Third, LSF overexpression can contribute
to chemoresistance [7], since LSF transcriptionally regulates
expression of thymidylate synthase [10], a target of the
chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil [7]. Finally, nuclear
translocation of LSF upon overexpression of Snail can lead
to transcriptional upregulation of fibronectin expression,
contributing to induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) [11].
We previously identified Factor Quinolinone
Inhibitors (FQIs) as specific inhibitors of LSF DNAbinding and of LSF transcriptional activation [12]. The
prototype, FQI1, markedly inhibited proliferation and
induced apoptosis of human HCC cells at low micromolar
doses, without causing toxicity to normal immortal human
hepatocytes or primary mouse hepatocytes [12]. In a
subcutaneous xenograft model of human HCC in athymic
nude mice, FQI1 profoundly inhibited tumor growth
without causing toxicity to any other organs [12]. These
intriguing results suggested that FQIs might be effective
therapeutics for HCC, although requiring further stringent
evaluation.
We now demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of FQI1
and a related compound FQI2 in an endogenous mouse
model of HCC. We also document that FQIs cause mitotic
arrest and subsequent apoptosis. The lack of toxicity
combined with the targeting of this well-documented
vulnerability in cancer cells strongly support further
evaluation of FQIs in a Phase I/II clinical trial.

of the liver showed features of HCC in control animals
while FQI1- and FQI2-treated animals maintained normal
hepatic architecture (Figure 1A, lower panel). The liver
weight (Figure 1B) and number of nodules (Figure 1C) in
control mice were significantly higher than that in treated
mice suggestive of decrease in tumor burden upon FQI
treatment. Biochemically, the level of enzymes indicating
liver damage, such as Aspartate Aminotransferase
(AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Alkaline
Phosphatase, showed significant decreases upon FQI
treatment when compared to control (Figure 1D).
Immunohistochemical analysis of tumors revealed
significant increases in the HCC marker α-fetoprotein
(AFP), proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA), LSF target gene osteopontin (OPN) and
thymidylate synthase (TS) and angiogenesis marker CD31
only in control animals but not in FQI1- or FQI2-treated
animals (Figure 1E). Increased TUNNEL positive cells
(apoptotic cells) were observed in FQI1- or FQI2-treated
groups when compared to control animals (Figure 1F). No
obvious signs of toxicity, such as weight loss or changes in
behavior, feeding or grooming, were observed upon FQI1
or FQI2 treatment suggesting that these agents might be
potent and non-toxic HCC therapeutics.

LSF inhibitors decrease proliferation of human
HCC cells and induce G2/M cell cycle arrest
To obtain better insights into the mechanism of
action of FQI1 and FQI2, we performed a comparative
analysis of the effects of these two agents on human HCC
cells, QGY-7703 and Huh7. Cell proliferation analysis
by standard MTT assay showed that both FQI1 and FQI2
markedly decreased cell growth in a dose- and timedependent manner (Figure 2A). QGY-7703 cells showed
~90% reduction in cell growth by 48 hours while the
kinetics of killing in Huh7 cells was relatively slower. As
such for most of the studies we used 24 h treatment for
QGY-7703 cells and 48 h treatment for Huh7 cells.
LSF transcriptionally regulates thymidylate synthase
and we previously demonstrated that inhibition of LSF in
multiple cell types by expression of a dominant negative
LSF mutant induces a G1/S block or apoptosis in S phase
[10, 14], and in QGY-7703 cells induces cell cycle delay
in S phase [15]. To our surprise, treatment of serumstarved and released QGY-7703 and Huh7 cells with 2 μM
FQI1 or FQI2 resulted in potent cell cycle arrest in G2/M
phase along with an increase in sub-G1 peak suggestive of
apoptosis (Figure 2B). Quantification of distribution of cells
in each phase of the cell cycle is provided in Supplementary
Figure S1. FQI1 treatment showed an increased sub-G1
peak, compared to FQI2 treatment, in QGY-7703 cells,
prompting us to probe into this phenomenon in detail. Since
FQI2 is more potent than FQI1 in inhibiting LSF activity
and in inhibiting cell proliferation (10), we synchronized
QGY-7703 cells at the G1/S boundary by double thymidine
block and released the cells at 0 h in the presence of FQI1

RESULTS
Therapeutic efficacy of LSF inhibitors on
endogenous HCC
Alb/c-myc mice spontaneously develop HCC
and the kinetics of the hepatocarcinogenic process is
significantly accelerated upon treatment with DEN [13].
The chemotherapeutic efficacy of LSF inhibitors was
evaluated in Alb/c-myc mice harboring DEN-induced
liver tumors. The animals, treated with FQI1 and FQI2,
demonstrated marked decrease in tumor nodules (2 mm
or less in size) when compared to control (vehicle treated)
animals (Figure 1A upper panel). Histological examination

DNA content, vehicle-treated cells re-entered cell cycle in
G1 phase by 10 h after release, while FQI1-treated cells,
with both 2 and 5 μM concentrations, were arrested at G2/M
phase (Figure 2C). Interestingly, at 17 h post-treatment,
cells treated with 5 μM FQI1 maintained G2/M arrest
while cells treated with 2 μM FQI1 showed an increase in
sub-G1 peak. These findings suggest that dosage of the drug
determines cell fate and that FQI2 exerts a more potent cell

LSF inhibitory effect.

Induction of CyclinB1 upon FQI1 and FQI2

We checked the expression pattern of CyclinB1,
CDK1 and CDC25c, which function at the G2/M transition,
upon FQI1 and FQI2 treatment. CyclinB1 level was

significantly induced upon FQI1 and FQI2 treatment in HCC
cell lines (Figure 3A). While the level of CDK1 remained
unchanged, an increase in the mitotic form of CDC25c with
corresponding decrease in phospho-Ser216-CDC25c was
observed upon FQI1 and FQI2 treatment (Figure 3A).
The increase in CyclinB1 upon FQI treatment was
analyzed in more detail using a time-course analysis. Upon
release of serum-starved cells, CyclinB1 induction was evident
as early as 3 h after FQI1 treatment in QGY-7703 cells and at
12 h post-treatment in Huh7 cells with peak induction observed
at 24 h for QGY-7703 cells and 36 h for Huh7 cells (Figure 3B).
Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed increased expression
of CyclinB1 in FQI-treated QGY-7703 cells compared to
control cells (Supplementary Figure S2). Nuclear translocation
of CyclinB1 was observed at 12 h of FQI treatment especially
with FQI2 (Supplementary Figure S2). To determine whether

the kinetics of increase in Cyclin B1 levels corresponded to the
normal kinetics at the G2/M transition, CyclinB1 expression
levels were determined in QGY-7703 cells synchronization by
a double thymidine block and addition of 2 μM or 5 μM FQI1
at the time of release. At 7 h post-release, both vehicle-treated
and FQI-treated cells showed an increase in Cyclin B1 levels.
At 10 h post-treatment, when vehicle-treated cells returned
to G1 (Figure 2C), CyclinB1 level returned to base-line level,
as expected. In contrast, the increased level of cyclin B1 was
sustained in FQI1-treated cells (Figure 3C).

Inhibition of CyclinB1 or CDK1 protects from
G2/M arrest upon FQI treatment

with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX; 10
μg/ml) and performed cell cycle analysis. CHX treatment
markedly inhibited CyclinB1 induction upon FQI treatment,
as expected (Figure 4A). Correspondingly a profound
protection from FQI-induced G2/M arrest was observed
upon CHX treatment (Figure 4B and Supplementary
Figure S3). Inhibition of CDK activity by treatment with
a cell-permeable inhibitor Roscovitine (Rosc; 30 μM)
also abrogated CyclinB1 induction upon FQI treatment
(Figure 5A) and provided marked protection from G2/M
arrest (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure  S4). These
findings suggest a key role of CyclinB1/CDK1 in the
maintenance of G2/M arrest upon FQI treatment. The role
of CyclinB1 was checked by transfecting CyclinB1 siRNA
and analyzing cell cycle following FQI treatment. CyclinB1
siRNA provided significant protection from FQI-induced

cell cycle arrest (Supplementary Figure S5). However,
the magnitude of the protection was not as robust as that
provided by CHX or Roscovitine which might be due to
long kinetics of the assay using the siRNA.
Persistent CyclinB1 overexpression has been
identified as a marker for recurrent HCC [16]. We,
therefore analyzed DMSO and FQI-treated tumor samples
for CyclinB1 expression. While low level CyclinB1
expression was detected in vehicle-treated tumors, it
was barely detectable in FQI-treated normal liver tissue
(Supplementary Figure S6). These findings suggest that
proliferating tumor cells express low level of CyclinB1.
In FQI-treated cells, transient high induction of CyclinB1
in tumor cells leads to cell cycle arrest and eventual death.
As such at the end of the study CyclinB1 expression is not
detected in FQI-treated normal liver tissue.

maintain their functional attributes, which were initially
gleaned from in vitro and nude mice studies [12], in an
immunocompetent endogenous HCC model. It should
be noted that the treatment with FQIs was initiated at 22
weeks when tumors have already developed suggesting
that FQIs caused tumor regression rather than just
inhibition of growth. Further in vitro assays demonstrate
that FQIs exert a broad spectrum of anti-cancer effects
involving mitotic arrest, which significantly bolsters their
clinical relevance as HCC therapeutics.
The transition of cells from G2 to M phase of cell
cycle is controlled by members of the Cyclin/CDK family
[18]. The activation of CyclinB1/CDK1 is required for
progression of cells from G2 to M Phase in normal cells
[19]. The progression of cells to M phase requires stepwise
activation of CDK1 [20]. CDK1 can be deactivated by
phosphorylation at Thr14 and Tyr15 by Wee1 and Myt1
[21, 22]. Cdc25C is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates
Thr14 and Tyr15 of CDK1. Cdc25C can be inactivated
by phosphorylation at Ser216 by Chk1 and subsequent
sequestration of Cdc25C in the cytoplasm by binding of
Chk2 with members of the 14-3-3 protein family prevents
premature mitosis [23]. Many cytotoxic compounds
and DNA damaging agents are known to arrest cells in
different stages of the cell cycle and prevent proliferation
of cancer cells. These compounds often either deregulate
or inhibit the activation of Cyclin/CDKs resulting in cell
cycle arrest. We demonstrate that treatment with LSF
inhibitors induced a pronounced G2/M phase arrest with
a significant increase in CyclinB1. We also observed
an increase in the activity of Cdc25c phosphatase and
decreased levels of p-Ser216-Cdc25C which is an inactive
form of Cdc25c. This will in turn activate CDK1 leading
to activation of CyclinB1/CDK1 complex. Our results
therefore suggest that LSF inhibitors induce G2/M phase
cell cycle arrest, consistent with sustained activity of the
CyclinB1/CDK1 complex.
To check whether upregulation of CyclinB1/CDK1
complex is symptomatic of FQI-mediated mitotic blockage
and apoptosis, we inhibited cell cycle progression with
either roscovitine or cycloheximide. Treatment with
Roscovitine, a synthetic CDK inhibitor, has been shown to
induce a partial G2 cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells [24, 25].
We document that treatment with Roscovitine along with
LSF inhibitors greatly inhibited FQI-induced upregulation
of CyclinB1 expression. Flow cytometric analysis showed
that there was slight accumulation of cells in the G2/M
phase in Roscovitine-treated cells when compared to
control cells. However, Roscovitine plus FQI1 treatment
resulted in the same amount of G2/M phase cells, therefore
indicating that Roscovitine inhibited the mitotic defect
caused by FQI. Treatment with CHX prevented Cyclin
B1 induction, as expected, and also prevented the FQImediated G2/M phase defects. These results indicate that
induction of G2/M phase arrest by LSF inhibitor, which
is marked by upregulation of CyclinB1/CDK1 activity,
requires cell cycle progression into mitosis.

The induction of mitotic CDC25c upon FQI
treatment (Figure 3A) suggests potential mitotic arrest of
the cells. Staining of DNA in QGY-7703 and Huh7 cells
with DAPI clearly showed multinucleated cells upon FQI
treatment, which result from slippage after mitotic arrest
(Figure 6A, arrows). To capture the bulk of the cells shortly
after FQI-mediated cell cycle blockage, QGY-7703 cells,
synchronized by double thymidine block and released in
the presence of 2 μM FQI1, were harvested at 11 h postrelease. Cells were co-stained for α-tubulin and DNA
(using DAPI). Most of the cells in the vehicle group have
already undergone mitosis, although a few were imaged
still at metaphase or undergoing cytokinesis (Figure 6B).
In contrast, the FQI-treated cells remained in prometaphase
with condensed, but not congressed, DNA and spindle that
were either incomplete or disrupted (the latter indicated
with arrows) (Figure 6B). At later time-points (48 h),
multinucleation was also observed in H&E-stained QGY7703 cells (Figure 6C). A sustained activation of stressactivated kinase JNK, but not p38 MAPK, was observed
when the cells were treated with FQIs (Figure 6D).

LSF inhibitors induce apoptosis
We previously showed that FQI1 treatment of QGY7703 leads to apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL staining
[12]. To further these findings in the context of the mitotic
phenotypes, we characterized this apoptotic cell death upon
FQI treatment using a number of other molecular markers.
In QGY-7703 and Huh7 cells a significant increase in
Caspase 3 activity was observed upon treatment with
FQI1 or FQI2 (Figure 7A). Correspondingly, a significant
increase in apoptotic cells was observed upon Annexin V
staining followed by flow cytometry (Figure 7B). Cleavage
of PARP, another marker of apoptosis, was observed in
these cells when treated with FQI (Figure 7C). Although
the total level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL did not
change, an increase in phospho-Bcl-xL and a decrease in the
anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl1 and XIAP were observed in the
HCC cells upon treatment with LSF inhibitors (Figure 7C).

DISCUSSION
In the present study we report the chemotherapeutic
efficacy of LSF inhibitors on DEN-induced HCC in
Alb/c-myc transgenic mice. We previously documented
that the FQI1 inhibits human HCC xenografts in a nude
mouse model [12]. Here we document that treatment
with LSF inhibitors significantly reduced tumor burden
in Alb/c-myc mice accompanied by a significant decrease
in serum levels of liver enzymes that are markers of
liver damage [17]. In addition both FQI1 and FQI2
significantly inhibited proliferation and angiogenesis
and caused a significant decrease in the expression of the
LSF-target gene OPN [5]. These results confirm that FQIs

cell cycle histograms of the indicated cells upon 2 h pre-treatment with Roscovitine (Rosc) followed by treatment with FQI1 or FQI2.

Prolonged activation of CyclinB1/CDK1 during
mitotic arrest activity leads to phosphorylation of
numerous apoptotic regulatory proteins such as Mcl1,
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Caspase-9, Caspase-8, and stabilization of
survivin and/or maintenance of XIAP expression [26, 27].
Our results show that mitotic arrest upon treatment with
LSF inhibitors leads to sustained elevation of CyclinB1/
CDK1, with increased phosphorylation and degradation
of Mcl1 and Bcl-xL. The activity of JNK was also
increased which might mediate hyperphosphorylation
and degradation of Mcl1. Furthermore, XIAP expression
was decreased upon LSF inhibitor treatment. Proapoptotic
indicators, such as increased Caspase-3 activity and PARP
cleavage, were also observed. These findings provide a
mechanistic basis for why cells undergo apoptosis after
prolonged mitotic arrest induced by LSF inhibitors.
In summary, we document that the FQI family of
LSF inhibitors have multiple consequences. On one hand,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as previously shown, inhibition of LSF transcriptional
activity blocks induction of LSF target genes that mediate
downstream oncogenic signaling. Additionally, these
inhibitors cause mitotic arrest culminating into apoptosis.
These multiple targets exert profound anti-cancer activity
which is confirmed by marked reduction in tumor burden
in DEN-treated Alb/c-myc mice. The mechanism by
which LSF inhibitors induce mitotic arrest remains
to be fully elucidated, and is a focus of current efforts.
Lack of toxicity combined with multimodal anti-cancer
mechanisms support the hypothesis that LSF inhibitors
may prove to be clinically relevant and potentially
effective therapeutics for HCC. Since LSF promotes
both primary tumors and metastasis FQIs might be useful
for treating advanced metastatic HCC either alone or in
combination with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such
as sorafenib, thereby providing dual pronged attack for
successful elimination of the disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 μg/gm body weight
of N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) was given at 14 days
of age to male Alb/c-myc mice [13]. The animals were
divided randomly into 3 groups (10 mice per group) and
treated with i.p. injections of FQI1 or FQI2 (4 mg/kg).
The treatment started at 22 weeks of age with 3 cycles
of treatment (5 injections per week per cycle) over 6
weeks and the animals were sacrificed 2 weeks after the
last injection. Blood samples were collected for liver
enzyme analysis at the Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory,
Department of Pathology, Virginia Commonwealth
University. The liver tissue was fixed in 10% formalin and
used for histopathology and immunohistochemistry studies.

Chemicals
Small molecule inhibitors of LSF, FQI1 and its
achiral analogue FQI2, have been described previously
[12]. After initial titration, in vitro assays were performed
using either 2 or 5 μM FQI1 or FQI2. As indicated, cells
were pre-treated for 2 h with Cycloheximide (10 μg/ml;
Sigma; C7698) or Roscovitine (30 μM; Cell Signaling;
#9885) before treatment with LSF inhibitors. Control and
Cyclin B1 siRNAs were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech
(sc-37007 and sc-29284, respectively).

or Roscovitine experiments, serum-starved synchronized
cells were pretreated with respective agents for 2 h in
complete growth medium prior to FQI1 or FQI2 treatment.
Additionally, cell cycle synchronization of QGY-7703
cells was achieved by double thymidine block essentially
as described previously [29], followed by release at 0 h in
the presence of FQI1. At the end of the experiment cells
were harvested, fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with
propidium iodide followed by flow cytometry for cell cycle
analysis [30]. For siRNA experiments, QGY-7703 cells
were synchronized by serum starvation for 24 h following
which siRNAs were transfected. After 24 h, the cells were

a Zeiss AxioImager. Z1 microscope at 100x magnification.

Statistical analysis
Data were represented as the mean ± Standard Error
of Mean (S.E.M) and analyzed for statistical significance
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Newman-Keuls test as a post hoc test. A P value of < 0.05
was considered as significant.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was carried out using formalinfixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections as described [28].
The sections were blocked in phosphate buffered salinetween 20 (PBST) using 10% normal goat serum. The
primary antibodies were diluted in PBST containing 5%
goat serum. The primary antibodies used were: anti-AFP
(Santa Cruz; rabbit polyclonal; 1:50); anti-CD31 (Dako;
mouse monoclonal; 1:50); anti-PCNA (Cell Signaling;
mouse monoclonal; 1:100); anti-OPN (Millipore; rabbit
polyclonal; 1:500); anti-CyclinB1 (1:100, rabbit polyclonal;
Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBST
containing corresponding 2.5% blocking serum. The signals
were developed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complexes with
a DAB substrate solution (Vector laboratories). Images were
analyzed using an Olympus microscope.

Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence was performed as described
[28]. The primary antibody was anti-α-Tubulin (Cell
Signaling; mouse monoclonal; 1:2000) and the secondary
antibody was Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG
(Molecular Probes; 1:500). The slides were mounted in
VectaShield fluorescence mounting medium containing
4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories).
Images were analyzed using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning
microscope. Alternatively, cells were stained with α-tubulin
antibody (1:50, mouse monoclonal; Abcam) followed by
a CY5-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (1:200;
Abcam). The cover slips were mounted with Invitrogen Anti
Fade Mounting Medium containing DAPI and imaged using
a Zeiss AxioImager.Z1 microscope at 63x magnification.
