Abstract
p300/cyclic AMP–responsive element binding protein–binding
protein (CBP) are general coactivators for multiple transcription factors involved in various cellular processes. Several
highly conserved domains of p300/CBP serve as interacting
sites for transcription factors and regulatory proteins.
Particularly, the intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
activity and transactivation domains (TAD) play essential
roles for their coactivating function. Autoacetylation of p300/
CBP is commonly observed in cell-free HAT assays and has
been implicated in the regulation of their HAT activity. Here,
we show that six lysine-rich regions in several highly
conserved functional domains of p300 are targeted by
p300HAT for acetylation in cell-free systems. We show that
p300 is susceptible to acetylation in cultured tumor cells and
that its acetylation status is affected by histone deacetylase
inhibitor trichostatin A. We further show that either treatment
with deacetylase inhibitors or coexpression of Gal4-p300HAT,
which alone has no transactivation activity, stimulates the
activity of the COOH-terminal TAD of p300 (p300C-TAD). We
have defined the minimal p300C-TAD and show that it is
sufficient to respond to deacetylase inhibitors and is a
substrate for p300HAT. Finally, we show that acetylated p300
possesses enhanced ability to interact with p53. Taken
together, our data suggest that acetylation regulates p300CTAD and that acetylation of p300/CBP may contribute to the
dynamic regulation of their complex formation with various
interacting partners. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2256–64]

Introduction
p300 and cyclic AMP (cAMP)–responsive element binding
protein (CREB)–binding protein (CBP) interact with and serve as
coactivators for a variety of transcription factors, including MyoD,
p53, CREB, signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat)
family, GATA, nuclear factor-nB, Smad family, E2F family (1), and
hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1; ref. 2). They are involved in
multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation,
growth arrest, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cellular response to
stress environments, such as hypoxia, inflammation, and exposure

to chemotherapeutics (1, 3, 4). It has been proposed that p300/CBP
serve as integrators of various signals and coordinately regulate the
expression of multiple genes for a programmed cellular response to
these signals. How p300/CBP distinguish and integrate the various
signals and respond accordingly by selectively stimulating the
expression of a specific group of genes is not completely
understood.
It has been well documented that each molecule of p300 or
CBP possesses two transactivation activities [NH2-terminal (N-TAD)
and COOH-terminal (C-TAD) transactivation domains; refs. 1, 5–7]
and an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (8, 9).
These activities have been correlated with specific highly conserved
domains of p300/CBP. Although all these activities may play
essential roles in the regulation of gene expression, how these
activities are regulated by various signaling pathways remains
unclear. However, it has been well established that activation of
signaling pathways may induce posttranslational modifications of
either p300/CBP or their interacting partners. Posttranslational
modifications of the latter, mostly transcription factors, may affect
their interaction with p300/CBP, thus regulating the selective
coactivating activity of p300/CBP and turning on a cooperative
spectrum of genes to execute a programmed process (7, 10–15).
Protein kinase A–mediated phosphorylation of CREB and DNA
damage–induced phosphorylation of p53 enhance their interaction
with p300/CBP and turn on genes involved in energy metabolism
and DNA repair, respectively (16–18). The oxygen-dependent
hydroxylation of HIF-a by factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1; ref. 19)
effectively prevents the recruitment of p300 and subsequently
inhibits the activation of HIF-1, a transcription complex that
coordinates systemic response to hypoxic stress and controls
glucose metabolism and angiogenesis (14, 15). Importantly,
posttranslational modifications of p300/CBP also regulate p300/
CBP functions. Both phosphorylation and methylation have been
found to regulate p300 transactivation activity and its interaction with transcriptional factors, thus regulating gene expression
(1, 20, 21).
The acetylation of nonhistone proteins by p300/CBP, including
transcription factors, has been observed previously (1, 22, 23).
Similarly, histone deacetylases (HDAC), which were originally
named based on their ability to remove the acetyl group from
histones, have been found to deacetylate nonhistone proteins
(24–27). p300-catalyzed acetylation of transcription factors, such as
p53, has been reported to enhance their ability to recruit p300/CBP,
thus stimulating their transactivation activity (28). Autoacetylation
of p300 was also observed in cell-free systems (29) and it has been
reported that autoacetylation of the p300HAT region regulates
p300HAT activity in cell-free systems (30). We recently reported
that p300HAT acetylated p300CH1, which may be involved in the
regulation of HIF-1 activity (31). However, whether other regions of
p300 are subject to acetylation and the potential biological
significance of such modifications have not been investigated.

p300 Acetylation Regulates Its Functions

HDAC inhibitors (HDAI) have been intensively explored as new
therapeutics for cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and hematologic disorders (32–35). Particularly, in cancer trials, HDAIs
effectively repress tumor growth and angiogenesis. It has been
found that HDAIs enhance the transactivation activity of a variety
of transcription factors, but repress HIF-1 and HIF-2 (31), the
master regulators of tumor angiogenesis. In line with that,
FR901228 (also called romidepsin), an HDAI that is undergoing
clinical phase II studies in treating patients who have relapsed or
refractory multiple myeloma, has recently been shown to
negatively affect the HIF-1 pathway (36). The potential effects of
HDAIs on p300 or CBP function have not been well evaluated.
In this study, we investigated the p300HAT-catalyzed acetylation
of p300. We report here that multiple domains of p300 are subject
to p300HAT acetylation, and the acetylation status of p300 can be
enhanced by HDAIs. We further show that the acetylation status of
p300 regulates its transactivation activity and complex formation
with p53 tumor suppressor.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids and DNA recombination. pGEX-hp53 and pGEX-pCAFaa352832 were provided by Dr. S. Berger (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA;
refs. 32, 33). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FIH-1 was a kind gift from
Dr. G. Semenza (Johns Hopkins University MD; ref. 19). GST-TFIIB was
constructed by inserting the TFIIB coding fragment obtained from reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) into pGEX-2T vector. GST-p300aa1-596, GSTp300aa744-1571, GST-p300aa1572-2376, and GST-p300aa1709-1915 (KR6)
were provided by Dr. P.L. Puri (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) or Dr. S.
Bhattacharya (Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom; refs. 3, 34). Other
GST-p300 constructs (GST-p300KR1aa230-430, GST-p300KR2aa560-660,
GST-p300LK3aa954-1206, GST-p300KR4aa1196-1400, GST-p300KR5aa14011600, and GST-p300aa1000-1707) were made by PCR using wild-type p300 as
template (primer information provided as Supplementary Materials). All
PCR fragments were inserted into suitable pGEX vectors using compatible
restriction sites to fuse with GST in frame.
pGal4-p300 constructs ( full-length, amino acids 964–1,922, 1,737–1,922,
and 1,737–2,414) were described previously (5, 20). pGal4-p300aa1-596 was
generated by digesting pGal4-p300 with BamHI and NotI and followed by
blunt-end religation. All other Gal4 fusion constructs of p300 were made by
PCR amplification of corresponding coding fragments with designed
primers (Supplementary Materials) that were synthesized in the Nucleic
Acid Facility at Kimmel Cancer Center. PCR products were ligated into
EcoRI and XbaI sites on pcDNA3-DNA binding domain (DBD; ref. 37).
pcDNA3-flag-HDAC1 was provided by Dr. A. Giordano (Temple University,
Philadelphia, PA; ref. 38). pcDNA3-Sirt2 was constructed by insertion of the
coding human cDNA fragment (Genbank accession no. NM_012237), which
was obtained by RT-PCR. All constructs were confirmed by automated
sequencing analysis (Kimmel Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA).
Special reagents. Trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaB) were
purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO), respectively. Protein-A/G Sepharose beads were purchased
from Pierce (Rockford, IL). HAT assay kits, including biotinylated histone
H4 peptides and streptavidin beads, were purchased from Upstate Biotech
(Lake Placid, NY).
GST fusion protein expression and purification. Plasmids expressing
the indicated GST fusion proteins were transformed into competent
Escherichia coli (strain BL21, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the expression
was induced by addition of isopropyl-L-thio-h-D-galactopyranoside (Promega, Madison, WI) to 0.1 mmol/L. The induction was done at 25jC with
mild shaking for 3 to 6 h. The procedures used for purification were the
same as described previously (39). Briefly, the induced cells were collected
by centrifugation and lysed in NETN buffer (39) with sonication. After two
rounds of centrifugation at 13,000  g, the supernatants were collected
and incubated with glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads (Amersham,

www.aacrjournals.org

Piscataway, NJ). The immobilized fusion proteins were washed four times
with NETN buffer (39).
To release the expressed HAT from the GST beads, the protein amounts
were first estimated by sampling on SDS-PAGE with serially diluted bovine
serum albumin (BSA) standards. The fusion proteins were then equilibrated
twice in 1 PBS. Thrombin or factor Xa (Sigma-Aldrich), whichever was
applicable, was added in a ratio of 1:300 or 1:50, respectively, at 30jC for 5 h.
The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 13,000  g for 5 min.
Factor Xa was removed by immunoprecipitation, done with a removing kit
obtained from Sigma. If needed, the supernatant was finally concentrated
by microcentricons (Ambion, Austin, TX) by following the instructions
provided by the manufacturer. The HAT activity was estimated with a HAT
assay kit from Upstate Biotech, using biotinylated histone H4 peptides as
substrates.
Cell lines and transfection. All cell lines were maintained at 37jC in a
humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK 293 (human
embryonic kidney) and HeLa (human cervical cancer) cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/
mL), and streptomycin (100 Ag/mL; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transient
transfection was done with LipofectAMINE Plus or LipofectAMINE2000
reagents (Invitrogen) by following the low-serum protocol provided by
the manufacturer. The amount of DNA used in transfection was described
in each experiment. When needed, 0.5 Ag of plasmid expressing hgalactosidase was cotransfected to normalize the transfection efficiency, as
described previously (15). All transfected DNA amounts were balanced by
filling up with empty expression vector. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, the cells were trypsinized, pooled, and equally divided into
12-well-plate luciferase and h-galactosidase assays (at least in triplicate) or
into 60-mm dishes for immunoblotting analysis.
Luciferase and B-galactosidase assays. All cell extracts were prepared
and analyzed using the Luciferase Assay System purchased from Promega
following the manufacturer’s procedure. Luminescence was measured in a
TD20/20 Luminometer (Promega), and the results were expressed as
relative light units (RLU). Protein concentration was determined by the BioRad method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) when needed. h-Galactosidase assays
were done in 1 Z buffer (40) with a h-galactosidase Assay kit from
Promega.
Antibodies, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting analyses.
Anti–acetyl-H3 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotech. Anti-p300
and anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences,
Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). Anti–acetyl lysine antibodies were purchased
from Stressgen (Ann Arbor, MI) and Abcom (Cambridge, MA). Anti–acetylCBP/p300 was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-GAL4
DBD antibody was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA).
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–coupled anti-mouse IgG was purchased
from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-E1A antibody (M73) and immunoprecipitations were described previously (40). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 250 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton 100, 5 mmol/L EDTA,
50 mmol/L NaF, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 1 protease inhibitor mix (pH 7.5); ref. 40]. Cell lysates were
first incubated with nonspecific normal mouse serum and killed protein
A–positive Staphylococcus aureus cells (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN). The precleared lysates were incubated with 2 Ag of monoclonal
antibody on ice for 30 min followed by rocking with immobilized protein
A/G (Pierce, Rockford, IL) at 4jC for 45 min. For immunoblotting analyses,
samples were separated on a 4% to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad), if not
specified, followed by electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBST buffer
(15), sequentially incubated with specific antibody, washed in TBST, and
incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The membranes were
finally developed with the ECL plus system (Amersham).
Acetylation assays. Standard HAT assays were done as previously
described (40). Briefly, for each assay, 250 AL of reaction mixture containing
2.5 mg/mL of BSA, 5 AL of [14C]acetyl-CoA (0.25 ACi, 4 nmol) were set up in
1 HAT buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 protease
inhibitor cocktail] and incubated at 30jC for 30 min. Fifty microliters of
streptavidin-Sepharose beads were equilibrated in 1 HAT buffer first and

rocked with the reaction mixture to collect biotinylated histone peptide at
4jC for 20 min. Following four washes with 500 AL radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, the beads were resuspended in 100 AL of RIPA
buffer and transferred into vials for liquid scintillation counting. When
immobilized samples were examined for HAT activity, the reactions were
carried out with slow rocking at 30jC for 1 h followed by centrifugation.
The supernatants were collected and rocked with streptavidin-Sepharose
beads. When immobilized nonhistone proteins were used as substrates in
acetylation assays, samples were rocked with mobilized recombinant
p300HAT or pCAF in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA (Amersham) and BSA
(2.5 mg/mL) in 300 AL of 1 HAT buffer at 30jC for 1 h. Immobilized
protein samples were collected by centrifugation and followed by four
washes with RIPA buffer. Finally, the samples were separated on SDS-PAGE
gels followed by autoradiography.

Results
p300 and CBP possess six lysine-rich, highly conserved
regions in their functional domains. It has been observed that
p300 autoacetylates itself in acetylation assays in cell-free systems
(29). Analysis of the primary structure of p300 revealed six lysinerich regions (KR; Fig. 1A). These regions completely or partially
overlap with several important functional domains of p300/CBP
and have been shown to be essential for the coactivating activity of
p300/CBP (1, 7, 29). KR1 (amino acids 243–423) overlaps with CH1
and p300N-TAD (1, 5). This region also interacts with multiple
transcription factors (p53, HIF-1a, cited2, Ets-1, Stat2, etc.) and
MDM2 (3, 4, 20). KR2 (amino acids 569–654) coincides with KIX,
another domain that is important for protein complex formation

and is responsible for cAMP-mediated signaling that regulates
energy metabolism (1, 7, 16). KR3 (amino acids 970–1,180) overlaps
the bromodomain, which is important for binding to the
nucleosome and confers CtBP-mediated (41), as well as CtBPindependent repression (42). KR4 (amino acids 1,228–1,358) and
KR5 (amino acids 1,407–1,592) are the NH2-terminal and COOHterminal parts of the HAT domain (8, 9, 30). Finally, KR6 (amino
acids 1,674–1,832) encompasses CH3, which is an interacting site
for multiple transcriptional regulators (c-Fos, GATA-1, E2F, MyoD,
p53, etc.) and tumor viral proteins (SV40 Tag, adenoviral E1A;
reviewed in ref. 1). Further analysis shows that most of the lysyl
residues are conserved among p300/CBP identified from multiple
species, and some are among the most conserved residues in the
p300/CBP primary structure (Fig. 1B), suggesting that they may be
important for the functioning of these domains.
Multiple regions of p300 are susceptible to autoacetylation
by p300HAT in cell-free systems. We first determined which
region or regions were susceptible to acetylation by p300HAT.
Initially, we expressed three large fragments that spanned the
majority of full-length p300 as GST fusion proteins: GST-p300aa1596, which covers KR1 and possesses the CH1 transactivation
activity; GST-p300aa744-1571, which contains the bromodomain/
KR3 and KR4 and KR5, and GST-p300aa1572-2376, which covers the
KR6 and p300C-TAD (Fig. 2A). Acetylation assays in cell-free
systems using a recombinant p300HAT (Upstate Biotech) showed
that all these fusion proteins were susceptible to autoacetylation by
p300HAT, whereas GST alone was not (data not shown), suggesting
that multiple regions of p300 are potent substrates for p300HAT.

Figure 3. Transactivation activity of p300 is stimulated by TSA but repressed
by HDAC1. A, TSA enhances p300 acetylation in cultured tumor cells. HeLa cells
were exposed to 200 or 500 nmol/L TSA for 3 h before harvest. Cell lysates
were prepared and resolved through 4% to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE.
Immunoblotting assays were done with anti-p300, anti–acetyl-CBP/p300, and
anti–acetyl-H3. B, TSA stimulates p300 transactivation activity. A plasmid
expressing Gal4-p300 driven by a CMV promoter was cotransfected with
pCMV-LacZ and pFRLuc reporter into HeLa cells. Transfected cells were
exposed to increasing doses of TSA for 12 h before harvest. Luciferase activities
were determined and normalized to h-galactosidase activity. C, repression of
p300 activity by cotransfection of HDAC1 and Sirt2. The Gal4-p300 plasmid was
cotransfected with increasing amounts of plasmids expressing either HDAC1 or
Sirt2. Luciferase activities were determined and normalized to cotransfected
control plasmid pCMV-LacZ. Bars, SD.

To precisely map the acetylated regions, we inserted PCR
fragments encoding each KR region of p300 into pGEX-4T and
expressed the corresponding peptides as GST fusion proteins
(Fig. 2A). These proteins were purified as immobilized proteins on
beads and used as substrates for acetylation assays in cell-free
systems. To facilitate further studies, we expressed p300HAT
(amino acids 1,000–1,707) and pCAFHAT (amino acids 352–832),
which were subsequently purified and confirmed to have
satisfactory HAT activity by standard HAT assay with histone H4
peptides as substrates, whereas GST alone showed lack of HAT
activity. Because acetylation of p300 has been implicated in
repression of HIF-1, a confirmed HIF-1 repressor, FIH-1 (19) was
also tested but revealed no HAT activity (Fig. 2B). Not surprisingly,
we observed that all KR regions of p300 were acetylated by purified
recombinant p300HAT (Fig. 2C). Purified recombinant pCAFHAT
also acetylated some KR regions (data not shown). Because GST
alone was neither acetylated by p300HAT nor by pCAFHAT, we
concluded that these KR regions of p300 are susceptible to
acetylation by p300 and pCAF. Neither GST-HIF-1aaa530-826 nor
GST-FIH-1 was acetylated by p300HAT under identical experimental conditions (ref. 31 and data not shown), showing the substrate
specificity of the acetylation of KR regions. Consistent with these
data, the acetylation of CH1 (KR1; ref. 31), KR5 in the HAT domain
(30), and KR3 (43) was recently reported. However, in our assays,
the acetylation of KR5 was relatively weak (Fig. 2C).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

HDAIs enhance the acetylation and transactivation activity
of p300 in cultured tumor cells. Protein acetylation is a common
modification that regulates the transactivation activity of transcriptional factors and cofactors. Because both p300N-TAD and
p300C-TAD could be acetylated by p300HAT, we investigated the
effects of acetylation on p300 transactivation activity. In mammalian cells, the acetylation status of proteins is determined by a
balance between acetylases and deacetylases. To examine if p300 is
acetylated in cultured cells and to illustrate the effects of HDAIs on
total levels and acetylation status of p300, HeLa cells were exposed
to TSA for 3 h before lysate preparation. Although such treatment
enhanced the acetylation of p300 and histone H3, endogenous p300
levels did not change significantly (Fig. 3A), confirming that TSA
enhanced the acetylation of p300, but not p300 protein levels. To
further test if TSA affects the transactivation activity of p300, we
cotransfected a construct that expresses full-length p300 fused with
the Gal4 DBD together with a firefly luciferase reporter gene into
HeLa cells (38). In untreated cells, Gal4-p300 activated the
expression of luciferase activity, and exposure of transfected cells
to TSA significantly enhanced the expression of the reporter
luciferase in a dose-responsive manner (Fig. 3B). This enhancement
was not a consequence of elevated expression of Gal4-p300,
because we used the Gal4-p300 under the control of the
cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer-promoter, which is less affected
by TSA compared with other common expressing promoterenhancer combinations (31). More importantly, the relative
luciferase units (RLU) presented here have been corrected against

Figure 4. The p300C-TAD is affected by acetylation. A, effects of TSA on
the transactivation potential of p300aa1-596. Gal4-p300N-TAD (amino acids
1–596) was cotransfected (3 Ag) with the luciferase reporter (3 Ag) and
pCMV-LacZ (0.5 Ag). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split evenly
into 15 wells of 12-well culture plates and treated with various doses of TSA
in triplicate. RLUs were normalized to h-galactosidase activity and induction
factors are given. B, effects of TSA on p300C-TAD. Experiments were done as in
(A ), except that Gal4-p300C-TAD (amino acids 1,737–2,414) was used in
cotransfection. C, synergetic effects of p300HAT and TSA. The assay system
is outlined on the left. Plasmid expressing Gal4-p300C-TAD (2 Ag) was
cotransfected with indicated plasmid (2 Ag) in reporter assays. RLUs were
normalized first to h-galactosidase activity and calculated into fold of
enhancement for comparison. Data showed that corecruitment of p300
full-length (fl) or p300HAT domain to the Gal4 promoter enhanced the
transactivation potential (open columns ) and increased the sensitivity of
Gal4-p300C-TAD to TSA (solid columns , 150 nmol/L). Bars, SD.

minimal p300C-TAD, p300C-TADf, and
p300C-TADh, respectively, were
expressed in E. coli . These regions both
contain three lysyl residues as indicated.
Purified GST-p300C-TADf and
GST-p300C-TADh were used in
acetylation assays with p300HAT. GST
alone and GST-p53 were included as
negative and positive controls.

h-galactosidase activity expressed from cotransfected pCMV-LacZ,
which has the same enhancer/promoter elements. In the absence
of Gal4-p300, TSA showed no obvious effect on the reporter gene
expression (not shown). These data suggest that TSA enhances
luciferase reporter gene expression through Gal4-p300. Similar
results were obtained when NaB was used. Because both TSA and
NaB are inhibitors for the class I/II HDACs, the stimulatory effects
of TSA on p300 transactivation activity suggest that it is repressed
by a member of the class I/II HDACs. Consistent with this concept,
it has been recently reported that p300 interacts with HDAC1 (38).
We next examined the effect of overexpression of HDAC1 on p300
transactivation activity and observed that forced expression of
exogenous HDAC1 efficiently repressed p300 activity (Fig. 3C).
Overexpression of Sirt2, a member of class III HDACs, also
repressed p300 transactivation activity, but to a lesser extend
(Fig. 3C).
The C-TAD, but not the N-TAD of p300, is sensitive to HDAIs.
p300N-TAD and p300C-TAD involve KR1 and KR6, respectively.
In addition, KR5 in the HAT region is susceptible to acetylation
(Fig. 2; ref. 30), which may indirectly affect the transactivation
activity of p300. Effects of HDAIs on the transactivation activity of
p300N-TAD and p300C-TAD were evaluated separately. We
cotransfected either Gal4-p300N-TAD (amino acids 1–596) or

www.aacrjournals.org

Gal4-p300C-TAD (amino acids 1,737–2,414) with the luciferase
reporter (15). Both Gal4-p300N-TAD and Gal4-p300C-TAD were
shown to have stronger transactivation activity than the fulllength p300 fused with Gal4 DBD (data not shown), consistent
with previous reports (5, 6). The Gal4-p300aa964-1922, which
carries the HAT activity and contains the region reported to
interact with TFIIB (5, 6), showed no transactivation activity (not
shown). Upon exposure of the transfected cells to TSA, the Gal4p300N-TAD was only slightly stimulated (Fig. 4A), but Gal4-p300CTAD was strikingly enhanced (Fig. 4B). Next, we cotransfected
Gal4-p300C-TAD with either Gal4-p300aa964-1922 (bearing the
HAT) or Gal4-p300aa1737-1922 (no HAT activity). We observed
that coexpression of Gal4-p300aa964-1922 enhanced p300C-TAD
activity f3.5-fold in the absence of TSA (Fig. 4C). Gal4-p300
showed a similar effect, whereas transfection with Gal4-p300aa17371922, which lacks HAT activity, showed no effect (Fig. 4C). All
combinations of cotransfections reached maximal activity (f13to 20-fold compared with Gal4 DBD alone) when exposed to
300 nmol/L of TSA (overrange, not shown in chart), whereas
150 nmol/L of TSA markedly enhanced the transactivation and
showed synergetic effects with coexpressed Gal4-p300aa964-1922
(HAT). These data suggest that an acetylation event enhances the
activity of p300C-TAD.

Defining the minimal p300C-TAD and the HDAI-responsive
region. p300C-TAD has been generally described as amino acids
1,737 to 2,414, a fairly large region of 678 amino acids (5, 6).
Although various constructs have been used to represent the
p300C-TAD in different reports (5, 6, 20, 38), the minimal region for
this activity has not been precisely defined. In addition, KR6/CH3
has been reported to interact with TBP, TFIIB (5, 6), and HDAC1
(38), whereas its role for the transactivation activity of p300C-TAD
remains unclear. To explore the minimal domain requirement for
p300C-TAD, its responsiveness to HDAIs and the role of KR6/CH3,
we constructed a set of progressively truncated mutants of p300CTAD fused with Gal4 (Fig. 5A). Cotransfection assays revealed that
complete deletion of KR6/CH3 (C-TADe) did not impair, but
enhanced, the transactivation activity, suggesting that KR6/CH3
is repressive for C-TAD transactivation activity (Fig. 5A). The
enhancement caused by deletion of CH3 is consistent with the
report that this region interacts with HDAC1 (38). Of note,
immunoblotting assays showed similar levels of expression for all
constructs used (not shown). Further investigation showed that
deletion from the COOH-terminal side to amino acid 2,180 or from
the NH2-terminal side to amino acid 1,910 did not impair p300CTAD (p300C-TADf; Fig. 5B). However, deletion of the conserved I
domain abolished the transactivation activity. Therefore, the amino
acid 1,910 to 2,180 region is sufficient, and the I domain is
necessary for p300C-TAD transactivation activity.
Interestingly, all the tested constructs, including the minimal
transactivation domain (C-TADf and C-TADh), were stimulated by
TSA (Fig. 5A and B), suggesting that the minimal C-TAD could be a
direct target for p300HAT-catalyzed acetylation. To confirm this
possibility, we expressed C-TADf and C-TADh as GST fusion
proteins. Acetylation assays in cell-free systems with p300HAT
showed that p300HAT acetylated both fusion proteins (Fig. 5C).
Therefore, the minimal p300C-TAD is subject to autoacetylation by
p300HAT.
Acetylation regulates the complex formation of p300.
Because we observed that the major regions of p300 involved in
protein-protein interactions are susceptible to acetylation, we
examined if acetylation of p300 plays a regulatory role in the
regulation of p300 complex formation with p53 as a model
molecule. Indeed, TSA treatment enhanced the coprecipitation of
p300 with exogenously expressed p53 in HEK 293 cells without
affecting the endogenous p300 levels. Interestingly, complex
formation of p300 with E1A, the adenoviral oncoprotein expressed
in 293 cells, remained unchanged by TSA treatment, suggesting a
specific role for HDAC inhibition in complex formation between
p300 and p53 (Fig. 6A). Acetylation of Lys-382 of p53 has been
reported to enhance the ability of p53 to recruit p300 (44, 45),
making it difficult to determine the contribution of p300
acetylation in the regulation of p53-p300 interaction in cultured
tumor cells. To distinguish the effect of p53 acetylation from that of
p300 acetylation, we generated p53K382L mutant (Lys-382
substituted by leucine) and transfected it into HeLa cells. Coupled
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays revealed that
TSA enhanced the coprecipitation of p300 with both wild type and
p53K382L (Fig. 6B). Next, we expressed and purified p53 as GST
fusion proteins from E. coli. Although exposure of cells to TSA and
NaB did not affect the endogenous p300 levels, combined GST pulldown and immunoblotting assays showed that HDAIs enhanced
the ability of p300 to bind bacterially expressed GST-p53 that lacks
posttranslational modifications (Fig. 6C). HDAI treatment showed
limited effect on p300 interaction with GST-TFIIB. Taken together,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

these data indicate that p300 acetylation functionally contributes
to the regulation of p300-p53 complex formation.

Discussion
Autoacetylation of full-length p300 has been observed since the
first demonstration that p300 has intrinsic HAT activity (8). Our
study revealed that six lysine-rich regions of p300 and the minimal
p300C-TAD are susceptible to p300HAT-catalyzed autoacetylation.
We also found that HDAIs, which have been shown to be effective
in repressing tumor growth and angiogenesis, are able to induce
p300 hyperacetylation in cultured tumor cells. Of note, KR1, KR2,
and KR6 regions are important for p300 to form complexes with its
interacting partners. We propose that the acetylation status of
p300 might regulate p300 complex formation with interacting
partners. As a proof of principle, we provided data to show that the
acetylation status of p300 contributes to its interaction with p53. In
addition, the interaction enhanced by p300 acetylation may explain
a recent reported observation that HDAIs induce the function of
mutant p53 and cause cytotoxicity preferentially for tumor cells
with overexpressed mutant p53 (46).
Particularly, an acetylation event has been reported to be
repressive to the transactivation activity of HIF-a, which depends

Figure 6. p300 acetylation contributes to the regulation of p53-p300 complex
formation. A, HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type
p53, evenly split at 24 h posttransfection, and harvested 36 h after transfection.
Immediately before harvest, cells were treated with DMSO (none ), TSA (500
nmol/L), or NaB (5 mmol/L) for 3 h. Whole-cell lysates were prepared, separated
directly on a SDS-PAGE gel, or subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP ) with
anti-p53, anti-E1A, or anti-p300 antibodies. Immunoblots were detected with
anti-p300 antibody. B, plasmids expressing either wild-type p53 or p53K382L
were transfected into HEK 293 cells. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells
were split evenly and treated with either DMSO or TSA (500 nmol/L) for 3 h.
Whole-cell lysates (WCL ) were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was done
with anti-p53 antibody followed by immunoblotting to detect copurified p300.
C, HeLa cells were treated with DMSO, TSA (500 nmol/L), or NaB (5 mmol/L) for
3 h before harvest and lysate preparation. GST-p53 and GST-TFIIB were
purified from E. coli and incubated with the cell lysates in pull-down assays in the
presence of TSA. The pull-down complexes were resolved through SDS-PAGE,
followed by immunoblotting (IB ) to detect the associated p300.

p300 Acetylation Regulates Its Functions

on interactions with p300CH1/KR1 for activity (15, 31, 47). Because
the C-TADs of HIF-a are not acetylated by p300HAT (31), it has been
proposed that direct acetylation of CH1 or other p300KRs may be
involved in HDAI-induced repression of HIF function and tumor
angiogenesis (31, 48). We also studied if FIH-1 is involved in
acetylation-mediated repression of HIF-1 function. We previously
found that HDAIs have no effects on FIH-1 levels (31). We show
that recombinant FIH-1 has no HAT activity (Fig. 2B), and p300HAT
does not acetylate recombinant FIH-1 (not shown), suggesting that
FIH-1 is not a mediator for HDAI-induced repression of HIF-a
activity.
We noticed that the HAT domain is lysine rich (KR4 and KR5)
and can be acetylated in cell-free systems. The acetylation of the
KR5 region was recently reported to stimulate the HAT activity
(30). However, the effect of such acetylation on the HAT activity
was difficult to prove in our experimental setting. Immunoprecipitated p300 from HDAI-treated and nontreated cell lysates gave
similar HAT activity, even with a very short incubation (10 min;
data not shown). In addition, preincubation of p300HAT expressed
in E. coli with cell lysates and acetyl-CoA failed to enhance its HAT
activity. One of the possible explanations might be the rapid
autoacetylation of p300HAT when used in HAT assays. It was also
suggested that bacterially expressed recombinant p300HAT might
have been autoacetylated in bacteria (30). However, because
autoacetylation of p300HAT was clearly observed in acetylation
assays in cell-free systems, the recombinant p300HAT should not
have been completely, if at all, acetylated in bacteria.
Although it has been well demonstrated that p300HAT acetylates
itself and several other domains of p300 in cell-free systems, and
that HDAIs induce hyperacetylation of p300 in cultured cells,
whether the p300 acetylation in cultured cell results from
autoacetylation is difficult to determine. This is because p300
forms protein complexes with multiple partners, and some
interacting partners such as pCAF, TAF1, and SRC also have HAT

activity. The real acetylation status of p300 may be maintained by a
combination of multiple HAT enzymes and counterbalanced by
deacetylases. A recent report showed the interaction between Sirt1
and p300 and showed that acetyl-Lys-1020 and acetyl-Lys-1024 at
p300KR3 are substrates for Sirt1 (43), suggesting that the
acetylation status of p300 may be regulated by class III HDACs.
Because p300 hyperacetylation can be induced by inhibitors of
class I and II HDACs (Fig. 3A; ref. 31), the involvement of class I/II
HDACs in regulation of p300 acetylation status is also suggested.
The report of HDAC1 interacting directly with the p300KR6 region
supports this possibility (38).
HDAIs are currently in clinical trials for cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and hematologic disorders (17, 33–35). Our study
showed that HDAIs induce hyperacetylation of p300 in cultured
tumor cells. This hyperacetylation may involve multiple sites,
including the six KR regions. Because these KR regions are essential
for multiple functions, particularly for interaction with diverse
proteins, alteration of the acetylation status of these regions may
have complicated biological consequences. The diversity of p300
functions and the effects of HDAI-based therapies on p300/CBP
functions suggest that further investigation of the HDAI effects on
p300/CBP acetylation is essential to understand the molecular and
biochemical mechanisms underlying the pharmacologic effects of
HDAIs.
