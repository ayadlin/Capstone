Abstract
Diets enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA)
may protect against breast cancer but biochemical mechanisms are unclear. Our studies showed that the n-3 fatty acid
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) up-regulated syndecan-1 (SDC-1)
in human breast cancer cells, and we tested the hypothesis
that DHA-mediated up-regulation of SDC-1 induces apoptosis.
DHA was delivered to MCF-7 cells by n-3 PUFA–enriched lowdensity lipoproteins (LDL) or by albumin in the presence or
absence of SDC-1 small interfering RNA. The n-3 PUFA
induced apoptosis, which was blocked by SDC-1 silencing.
We also confirmed that SDC-1 up-regulation and apoptosis
promotion by n-3 PUFA was mediated by peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor ; (PPAR;). Using a luciferase
gene driven by either a PPAR response element or a DR-1 site
present in the SDC-1 promoter, reporter activities were
enhanced by n-3 LDL, DHA, and PPAR; agonist, whereas
activity of a luciferase gene placed downstream of a mutant
DR-1 site was unresponsive. Cotransfection with dominantnegative PPAR; DNA eliminated the increase in luciferase
activity. These data provide strong evidence that SDC-1 is a
molecular target of n-3 PUFA in human breast cancer cells
through activation of PPAR; and that n-3 PUFA–induced
apoptosis is mediated by SDC-1. This provides a novel
mechanism for the chemopreventive effects of n-3 PUFA in
breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2912–9]

Introduction
Although still controversial, several human epidemiologic
studies have shown that a high dietary intake of fish is associated
with a lower incidence of cancers, including breast cancer (1–3).
The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) contained in
fish oil are proposed to be the effectors of this protection. The two
main PUFA constituents are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3)
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), which are converted by
fish from a-linolenic acid (a-LNA; 18:3n-3) of ingested cold water
vegetation. Animal studies clearly support the idea that dietary
supplementation with fish oil or its constituent fatty acids not only
slows the growth of both xenograft (4, 5) and chemically induced
tumors (6, 7) but also increases sensitivity to chemotherapy (8, 9)
and inhibits metastases (4, 5). DHA in particular was shown to be a

potent enhancer of tumor cell chemosensitivity (10, 11). Biochemical mechanisms for the antitumor properties of n-3 PUFA are still
unclear but may include changes in eicosanoid metabolism,
reduction in oncogene expression, and modulation of lipid
peroxidation (reviewed in refs. 12, 13).
It is known that fatty acids can regulate gene transcription. We
have previously reported that the transmembrane heparan sulfate
proteoglycan syndecan-1 (SDC-1) is up-regulated by n-3 PUFA (14).
SDC-1 has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor molecule by
inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis (15, 16).
Proteolytic cleavage of the SDC-1 core protein at the cell surface
generates a soluble ectodomain that retains antigrowth properties
that depend on the presence of both core protein and heparan
sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains (15, 16). Growth inhibition has
been shown to require close proximity of SDC-1 ectodomain to the
cell surface and to involve delay of cell G1-S progression and downregulation of cyclin D1 (16). Although there are inconsistent reports
(17–19), the expression of SDC-1 is generally down-regulated in
malignant tumors (20, 21), and lower levels of expression have been
associated with high metastatic potential in malignant mesothelioma (22), invasive esophageal cancer (23), head and neck cancer
(24), lung cancer (25), and laryngeal cancer (26). SDC-1 expression
was markedly reduced in squamous cell carcinoma and there was
an inverse relationship between the level of SDC-1 expression and
tumor aggressiveness (27). Furthermore, survival rate was decreased in patients with SDC-1–negative colorectal cancer (28) and
was inversely associated with SDC-1 levels in gastric cancer (29).
In vitro studies have shown that SDC-1 inhibits the invasion of
tumor cells into type 1 collagen (30, 31) and that expression of
SDC-1 in myeloma cells suppresses matrix metalloproteinase-9
(32). A reduction in SDC-1 promoted normal murine mammary
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (31). Therefore, the decrease of
SDC-1 expression may be an important step from tumorigenesis to
the metastatic phenotype. However, there is little information on
factors that regulate SDC-1.
Insight into a potential mechanism underlying the effects of n-3
PUFA on SDC-1 gene expression was suggested by the finding that
the proximal promoter of the SDC-1 gene contains a specific
sequence termed a DR-1 element (33). This sequence is recognized
by several members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily,
including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR),
which participate in activating the basic transcriptional machinery
to regulate target genes. Fatty acids are known to bind and activate
PPARs (34–36). There are three PPAR subtypes (a, h/y, and g) with
different tissue distributions and physiologic involvements. Processes such as lipid and glucose homeostasis, inflammation, cell
growth and differentiation, and apoptosis have all been shown as
regulatory targets for the PPARs (reviewed in refs. 37, 38). In human
breast cancer cell lines, the activation of PPARa (39) as well as

n-3 PUFAs Promote Apoptosis through Syndecan-1

PPARh/y (40) stimulated proliferation, whereas ligands for PPARg
were growth inhibitory (41, 42).
In the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, n-3 PUFA not only
inhibited cell proliferation and increased apoptosis but also
promoted SDC-1 expression (14, 43). The SDC-1 response was
mimicked by the PPARg agonist troglitazone and blocked by a
PPARg antagonist. Present studies were undertaken to show a
novel pathway connecting n-3 PUFA, PPARg regulation of SDC-1,
and apoptosis. An important consideration in these studies was the
delivery of n-3 PUFA to the cells by a method designed to model
the in vivo process. Tumor cells obtain dietary PUFA by two major
pathways: uptake of fatty acid-albumin complexes that form after
lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and receptor-mediated
endocytosis of low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Therefore, we have
used LDL isolated from the plasma of monkeys fed a diet
supplemented with fish oil to examine a mechanism for n-3
PUFA–induced apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of LDL and fatty acids-bovine serum albumin complexes. LDLs were isolated from plasma of adult African green (vervet)
monkeys fed n-3 PUFA ( fish oil)-enriched diets for 3 to 5 y. Diets,
maintenance, and clinical measurements of the animals are published (43).
Animal care and procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and animals were
maintained by standard animal care procedures based on institutional
guidelines. LDL isolation and characterization procedures have been
previously described (43). To measure EPA and DHA concentrations in
n-3 LDL preparations, 100 AL LDL was added to 20.6 Ag C17:0
(as triheptadecanoate glyceride) and then saponified, extracted, and
derivatized by standard procedures. LDL fatty acid methyl esters were
quantified by gas-liquid chromatography, and EPA and DHA concentrations
were calculated relative to C17:0. Based on these measurements, in all
experiments when cells were treated with 100 Ag/mL n-3 LDL, they were
exposed to final concentrations of 52 Amol/L EPA and 21 Amol/L DHA from
the LDL. EPA and DHA were purchased as sodium salts (Sigma Chemical
Co.). Fatty acid–free bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) was prepared as a
125 Amol/L solution in DMEM/Ham’s F12. Fatty acid salts were solubilized
to 600 Amol/L stocks in the BSA medium as described (4:1 ratio of fatty acid
to BSA) and stored in aliquots at 20jC under argon (43). Tandem mass
spectroscopy analysis of the stock preparation of DHA showed <15%
peroxidation products. With regard to DHA stability, over a 48-h treatment
of cells, the DHA (as percentage of cell phospholipids) increased from
2.0 (time 0) to 3.7 (12 h), 5.7 (24 h), and 3.5 (48 h), indicating reasonable
persistence over the time periods studied.
Preparation of SDC-1 ectodomain. The SDC-1 ectodomain expression
construct was designed to encode a COOH-terminal polyhistidine fusion
protein and was created using a two-step cloning process as follows. The
SDC-1 ectodomain cDNA was amplified by PCR using the SDC-1 plasmid
(OriGene Technologies, Inc.) as the source of template, 5¶-gcagaattcggcagcatgaggcgcgcggcgctct-3¶ as the forward primer, and 5¶-gcaggatcctttcctgtccaggaggccctgtga-3¶ as the reverse primer. The resulting cDNA was cut with
BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases and ligated into the pTcam4
expression plasmid (44). In the second round of PCR, 5¶-gcaaagcttgaattcggcagcatgaggcgcgcg-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-gcaaagcttgaattcggcagcatgaggcgcgcg3¶ (reverse) primers were used to amplify the SDC-1 ectodomain cDNA from
the modified pTcam4 plasmid. The amplified cDNA was treated with
HindIII and XhoI and subsequently ligated into the pCEP4 (Invitrogen
Corp.) expression plasmid. The resulting plasmid was transfected into
293-EBNA cells and stable expressing cells selected by the addition of
200 Ag/mL hygromycin B. The cells were then amplified and grown to
confluence in T175 flasks. On confluence, the culture medium was replaced
with serum-free DMEM. Medium was then collected every 48 h and fresh
medium was added back to the cells. Under these conditions, the

www.aacrjournals.org

transfected cells remain viable for several weeks, allowing for the collection
of conditioned medium over an extended period of time. After collecting
several liters of conditioned medium, recombinant SDC-1 ectodomain was
purified using the following procedure. Conditioned medium was first
concentrated using a Millipore Pellicon 2 tangential flow system (Millipore
Corp.). Concentrated conditioned medium was then subjected to anion
exchange chromatography using an Amersham Biosciences ÄKTAexplorer
chromatography system equipped with a 5-mL HiTrap Q column and bound
SDC-1 ectodomain eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 2 mol/L sodium
chloride in a buffer consisting of 20 mmol/L Tris and 0.2% CHAPS (pH 8.0).
Cell culture. MCF-7 cell line was obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mg/mL porcine insulin (Sigma), penicillin/
streptomycin, and L-glutamine at 37jC in 5% CO2. In experiments
measuring mRNA, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) levels,
and PPARg protein synthesis, cells were seeded in six-well plates at a
density of 5  105 per well in growth medium. After 6 h, the medium was
changed to DMEM/F12 with 0.5% FBS for 18 h to up-regulate LDL
receptors. PPARg protein was determined after medium supplementation
with 100 Ag/mL n-3 LDL, 30 Amol/L DHA, 30 Amol/L EPA, or 5 Amol/L
troglitazone (Cayman Chemical) for 12 and 48 h.
Apoptosis assays. MCF-7 cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density
of 5  105 per well in DMEM/F12 with 0.5% FBS for 18 h and then exposed
to n-3 LDL, DHA, EPA, or troglitazone for 48 h or to SDC-1 ectodomain for
72 h. The SDC-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected cells were also
exposed to n-3 LDL, DHA, or troglitazone for 48 h. Apoptotic activity in
adherent cells was determined by cleaved PARP using Western blots.
Alternatively, apoptosis was measured with the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay in
which 30 AL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent were added to each well and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Luminescence was measured by a
Reporter Microplate Luminometer (Turner Biosystems). Treated cells were
also stained with trypan blue (Invitrogen), and percentage of dead cells was
counted by hemocytometer.
Real-time PCR. RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis and real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were as previously described (14). SDC-1
primers were 5¶-ggagcaggacttcacctttg ( forward) and 5¶-ctcccagcacctctttcct
(reverse). Peptidyl prolyl isomerase B (PPIB) housekeeping gene primers
were 5¶-gcccaaagtcaccgtcaa ( forward) and 5¶-tccgaagagaccaaagatcac
(reverse). Care was taken to design primers so as to minimize amplification
from any contaminating genomic DNA. The forward SDC-1 primer spans an
exon/intron junction. The PPIB primers are on different exons separated by
an f800 bp intron. Under the conditions of real-time PCR, we detected a
single PPIB product of 82 bp by gel electrophoresis, and melt curve analyses
performed at the end of the real-time PCR reproducibly show a single peak.
SDC-1 data were normalized to the housekeeping control PPIB and are
presented relative to control.
Western blot analysis. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS
and lysed for 10 min on ice; debris was then removed by centrifugation and
equivalent amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were
blocked with TBST [10 mmol/L Tris-base, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween
20 (pH 7.5)] containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature and
then washed thrice with TBST for 5 min, exposed to anti-PARP (Cell
Signaling Technology) and anti-PPARg (Abcam) antibodies in TBST
containing 3% BSA at 4jC overnight followed by three washes with TBST,
and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 h, washed with TBST, and developed using the SuperSignal
West Pico kit (Pierce). The band densities on photographic films were
analyzed using Quantity One software. For PARP cleavage measurement,
band densities were normalized to h-actin and presented as the fractional
change from control values.
SDC-1 siRNA transfection. Three SDC-1 siRNAs, 12432, 12527, and
142557, were purchased from Ambion. For transfection, 50 nmol/L siRNA
was added to 2.0  105 cells in six-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) and DMEM/F12 lacking serum and antibiotics. Control cells
were transfected with a negative control siRNA with no known mRNA target
designed by Ambion. At 6 h after transfection, each well was supplemented

with 2 mL of complete growth medium. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
the medium was replaced with 2 mL of DMEM/F12 containing 0.5% FBS
and cells were treated with n-3 LDL (100 Ag/mL), DHA (30 Amol/L), and
troglitazone (5 Amol/L) for an additional 48 h. Cells were prepared for
Western blot analysis as described above. Data are shown using SDC-1
siRNA 142557. Similar results were obtained with siRNA 12432, whereas
siRNA 12527 failed to silence SDC-1 mRNA and did not inhibit n-3 PUFA–
induced apoptosis.
Wild-type and mutant SDC-1 DR-1-luciferase constructs. The onecopy reporter construct DR-1 from the SDC-1 promoter [pGL3-(DR-1)WT;
ref. 33] was generated by annealing the oligonucleotides 5¶-cggttcttcccctttgctctctcggccgtttccgctacacccgagct-3¶ and 5¶-cgggtgtagcggaaacggccgagagagcaaaggggaagaaccggtac-3¶ before ligation into KpnI- and SacI-digested
pGL3-promoter vector (Promega). The one-copy mutant DR-1 reporter
construct [pGL3-(DR-1)] was generated using the same method and the
oligonucleotides 5¶-cggttctAGTActGCcCTcactcggccgtttccgctacacccgagct-3¶
and 5¶-cgggtgtagcggaaacggccgagTgagGGCagTACTagaaccggtac-3¶. Mutations

University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and pGL3-luc-DR-1
(wild-type or mutant) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche
Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected
cells were incubated with 0 Ag/mL n-3 LDL, 100 Ag/mL n-3 LDL,

30 Amol/L DHA, and 5 or 10 Amol/L of troglitazone for 8 or 24 h. Luciferase
activities were measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) in a TD-20e
luminometer (Turner Biosystems). h-Galactosidase activity was measured
using h-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay kit (Promega) in SpectroMAX.
Luciferase activities were normalized to h-galactosidase activity and are
presented as the percentage of luciferase activity measured in the presence of

Data analysis. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Student’s t test. The
assays were carried out in triplicate and the averages are shown together
with SE.

Results
DHA induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. We have previously
shown that n-3 PUFA–enriched LDL, but not n-6 PUFA–enriched
LDL, can induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (43). The n-3 LDL was
shown to contain two predominant species of n-3 PUFA, EPA and
DHA, and both were effectively delivered to the cells by the LDL. To
clarify the role of the individual n-3 PUFA in apoptosis induction,
MCF-7 cells were incubated with n-3 LDL, EPA-BSA, or DHA-BSA
for 48 h and apoptosis was measured by PARP cleavage. Consistent
with previous observations, n-3 LDL caused a 4- to 7-fold increase
in PARP cleavage product compared with control cells (Fig. 1A
and B). EPA-BSA was not effective in induction of apoptosis
(Fig. 1A), whereas a similar concentration of DHA-BSA resulted in

an increase in PARP cleavage similar to that of n-3 LDL (Fig. 1B).
Apoptosis was confirmed in cells treated with n-3 LDL and DHA by
Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Fig. 1C and D). As shown in Fig. 1D,
apoptosis induction by DHA was dose dependent, whereas no
apoptotic effect was observed with EPA at similar doses for 48 h or
in cells treated for up to 72 h (data not shown).
SDC-1 induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Consistent with the
effect on apoptosis shown in Fig. 1, previous studies have shown
that both n-3 LDL and DHA-BSA significantly up-regulated the
expression of SDC-1 in MCF-7 cells (14). To test the hypothesis that
n-3 PUFA–induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells is mediated by SDC-1,
studies were first conducted to show that SDC-1 is a proapoptotic
stimulant in this model system. Cells were cultured for 72 h in the
presence of human recombinant SDC-1 ectodomain, which
resulted, as shown in Fig. 2A, in a dose-dependent increase in
apoptosis of the cells as measured by PARP cleavage. To confirm
that SDC-1 is a mediator in n-3 LDL–induced and DHA-induced
apoptosis of MCF-7 cells, a SDC-1 siRNA was transfected into the
cells to silence SDC-1 expression. This reagent effectively inhibited
SDC-1 mRNA for up to 96 h after transfection (Fig. 2C). As shown
in Fig. 2B, the SDC-1 siRNA blocked the ability of n-3 LDL and DHA
to enhance PARP cleavage, which was markedly stimulated in cells
transfected with a control siRNA. It was also apparent that the level
of intact PARP was different in cells treated with SDC-1 and control

siRNA but further studies are required to determine the
significance of this. In any case, the absolute as well as relative
levels of PARP cleavage stimulated by n-3 PUFA were blocked by
SDC-1 silencing and the ratio of cleaved to intact PARP was
increased by n-3 LDL and DHA only in the presence of the
nontargeting siRNA (0.26 F 0.06 and 0.24 F 0.05 for control cells;
0.52 F 0.07 and 0.27 F 0.05, P = 0.03, for n-3 LDL–treated cells;
0.44 F 0.06 and 0.13 F 0.07, P = 0.02, for DHA-treated cells in the
presence of nontargeting and SDC-1 siRNA, respectively). Furthermore, a trypan blue exclusion assay confirmed that the SDC-1
siRNA inhibited n-3 PUFA–induced cell death (Fig. 2D).
PPAR; is a key factor in DHA or n-3 LDL up-regulation of
SDC-1 expression. In previous studies, we have shown that the
PPARg agonist troglitazone was an effective stimulator of SDC-1
expression, whereas the PPARy agonist GW610742 had no effect.
Moreover, the PPARg antagonist GW259662 blocked the effect of
n-3 LDL on SDC-1 expression (14). To directly implicate PPARg in
n-3 LDL and DHA regulation of SDC-1, MCF-7 cells were transfected
with a d/n PPARg cDNA or its vector pcDNA3. Figure 3A shows a
marked overexpression of PPARg protein in the transfected cells.
We then assessed the activity of the d/n PPARg construct by
determining SDC-1 mRNA level after stimulation with n-3 LDL and
DHA for 8 h (Fig. 3B). In cells transfected with the empty vector,
both n-3 LDL and DHA up-regulated SDC-1 expression. No such

(data not shown). Thus, it seemed that activation rather than
overexpression of PPARg by n-3 PUFA resulted in up-regulation of
SDC-1. To determine if n-3 LDL and DHA could activate a PPAR
transcriptional activity, MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with a
PPRE-TK-luciferase reporter plasmid and a control plasmid
containing the lacZ gene. Luciferase activity was determined after
treatment with n-3 LDL or n-6 LDL (100 Ag/mL), DHA or EPA

cDNA or empty d/n PPARg cDNA vector (pcDNA3 ). A, PPARg protein was
measured at 12 h by Western blot analysis. B, transfected cells were treated

response occurred in cells transfected with the vector encoding d/n
PPARg cDNA. These data indicate that n-3 LDL and DHA upregulated SDC-1 expression through PPARg.
PPAR; activation promotes apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. The
observations thus far have indicated that n-3 LDL and DHA induce
apoptosis of MCF-7 cells through up-regulation of SDC-1 in a
PPARg-activated transcriptional pathway. The next question
addressed the ability of PPARg to induce apoptosis in these cells.
To examine this, cells were treated with the PPARg agonist
troglitazone and cleaved PARP was measured by Western blot
analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, a dose-dependent increase in
cleavage product was observed in response to troglitazone
treatment. Thus, the PPARg ligand has a similar effect to n-3
PUFA in promoting apoptosis of the breast cancer cells. To explore
whether the activated PPARg induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells
through SDC-1, the cells were transfected with SDC-1 or control
siRNA and then were cultured in the presence of 5 Amol/L
troglitazone for 48 h (Fig. 4B and C). The apoptotic effect of
troglitazone was inhibited when SDC-1 expression was silenced.
These data indicate a critical involvement of SDC-1 in the
promotion of apoptosis by n-3 PUFA, troglitazone, and the
common target of these agents, PPARg.
PPAR; is activated by n-3 PUFA and regulates SDC-1
transcription via the DR-1 site. To further clarify the mechanism
whereby the PPARg pathway mediates n-3 PUFA up-regulation of
SDC-1, effects on PPARg expression were examined. Treatment
with n-3 LDL and DHA had no effect on PPARg mRNA level in the
cells, and furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that the level
of PPARg protein expression did not differ between control-treated
and n-3 PUFA–treated cells or in cells treated with SDC-1 siRNA

(30 Amol/L), or troglitazone (5 Amol/L) as a positive control. DHA,
n-3 LDL, and troglitazone significantly increased luciferase activity,
indicating a PPAR response that was blocked by cotransfection
with a d/n PPARg cDNA (Fig. 5A). To confirm the role of PPARg in
transcriptional regulation of SDC-1, the luciferase reporter gene
was placed under the control of either the wild-type [pGL3-(DR1)WT] or mutant [pGL3-(DR-1)Mut] DR-1 element from the SDC-1
promoter. MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with wild-type or mutant
SDC-1 DR-1-luciferase constructs and a d/n PPARg cDNA. The
result showed that pGL3-(DR-1)WT-luciferase reporter was activated by n-3 LDL, DHA, and troglitazone. Cotransfection of the
same reporter with d/n PPARg DNA blocked luciferase activity
(Fig. 5B). In addition, the transfected reporter gene containing
mutant SDC-1 DR-1 site completely abolished the effect of n-3 LDL,
DHA, and troglitazone. No significant effect on luciferase activity
was observed when the empty pGL3-promoter vector was transfected into MCF-7 cells and treated with n-3 LDL, DHA, or troglitazone (Fig. 5B). These data establish SDC-1 as a molecular target
for n-3 PUFA and PPARg.

Discussion
These studies have identified a novel pathway for the chemopreventive properties of n-3 PUFA in human breast cancer cells.
The most striking finding is that SDC-1, a key molecular target of
n-3 LDL and DHA, is a critical player in the ability of n-3 PUFA to
induce apoptosis in these cells. When SDC-1 expression was
silenced by siRNA, the ability of n-3 PUFA to induce apoptosis was
blocked. In addition, present studies have extended previous
observations (14) by more clearly defining the role of PPARg in the
n-3 PUFA up-regulation of SDC-1 expression. The studies reported
here delineate the pathway linking n-3 PUFA to cellular apoptosis
as follows: the n-3 PUFA DHA activates the nuclear transcription
factor PPARg, which results in transcriptional up-regulation of the
SDC-1 target gene, and the SDC-1 protein induces cell apoptosis.
Throughout these studies, we modeled two physiologic processes
of fatty acid delivery to the cells: by LDL and by albumin. Our
previous studies have shown that LDL, isolated from the plasma of
vervet monkeys fed a diet enriched in fish oil, contains two major
n-3 PUFA species: EPA and DHA (43). Incubation of MCF-7 cells
with this LDL showed that both EPA and DHA were efficiently
delivered to the cells and detectable in cell phospholipids by
24 h (43) and as early as 8 h.4 Proliferation of MCF-7 cells was
inhibited by n-3 LDL, which also induced apoptosis in the cells (43).
Neither of these effects was achieved by n-6 PUFA–enriched LDL.
What was puzzling was that EPA-BSA was ineffective in apoptosis
induction, a result confirmed by present studies. Evidence now
indicates that, by contrast, DHA-BSA is very effective in induction
of apoptosis and that DHA is likely to be the apoptotic stimulus in
the n-3 LDL.
DHA is synthesized from EPA by elongation and desaturation.
However, the conversion is not a straightforward one (see ref. 45 for
review). Specifically, EPA (20:5, n-3) is converted to docosapentaenoic acid (22:5, n-3) by elongase (Elovl)-5, and by Elovl-2 to 24:5,
n-3. The next step requires desaturation of the 24:5 at the D6
position to produce 24:6, n-3. This product is translocated from the
endoplasmic reticulum to the peroxisome where the h-oxidation
pathway exerts an acyl chain shortening of C2 to produce DHA
(22:6, n-3). Although our previous studies have shown that there is

driven by a PPAR response element (PPRE3-TK-luciferase reporter) and a
control plasmid containing the lacZ gene. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3-d/
n PPARg cDNA or empty d/n PPARg cDNA vector (pcDNA3 ) and treated with n-3
LDL or n-6 LDL (100 Ag/mL), DHA-BSA or EPA-BSA (30 Amol/L fatty acid,
7.5 Amol/L BSA), or troglitazone (10 Amol/L) and luciferase activity was measured
at 24 h. B, luciferase activity in MCF-7 cells cotransfected with a reporter
construct containing the DR-1 from the SDC-1 promoter linked to a minimal
promoter-luciferase reporter gene pGL3-(DR-1)WT or the same vector containing
the mutant DR-1 [pGL3-(DR-1)Mut] with or without the d/n PPARg cDNA.
Following transfection, cells were treated with n-3 LDL or n-6 LDL (100 Ag/mL),
DHA-BSA or EPA-BSA (30 Amol/L, 7.5 Amol/L BSA), or troglitazone (10 Amol/L)
for 8 h. Luciferase activity values are normalized to h-galactosidase activity
and presented as the percentage of luciferase activity measured in the presence
of stimulus relative to the activity of control cells with no stimulation. Basal activity
was reduced f2-fold by the d/n PPARg cDNA but not changed by mutant
DR-1. Values with different letters are significantly different (P < 0.05). *, P < 0.001.

some conversion of EPA to DHA in the MCF-7 cells, the inability of
EPA to induce apoptosis suggests either that the pool of DHA
derived from EPA may be less available to produce an apoptotic
response in the cell or that a critical threshold level of DHA needed
for activity cannot be achieved by this pathway. Our recent
unpublished studies have shown that, over a 48-h treatment with
EPA or DHA, the percentage DHA in MCF-7 cell lipids changes
from 1.8 at time 0 to 2.1 and 3.7, respectively, at 48 h. It may be
important to note that, in humans, studies have consistently shown
that increased consumption of either EPA or its precursor a-LNA
(18:3, n-3) does not result in a detectable increase in plasma DHA,
thus highlighting the inefficiency of conversion in this pathway
(46–48). Further studies are ongoing to clarify the metabolism of n3 PUFA in relation to apoptosis in these cells. One likely possibility
is that DHA is metabolized to a more active component that
becomes a key player in the pathway that we have identified.
We specifically showed effects of n-3 LDL and DHA on the level
and function of SDC-1. DHA and n-3 LDL significantly up-regulated

expression of SDC-1 in MCF-7 cells, whereas EPA was ineffective.
To connect the up-regulation of SDC-1 with apoptosis induction,
we showed that exogenous human recombinant SDC-1 ectodomain
stimulated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. This is distinct
from studies of Mali et al. (15), which showed cell growth inhibition
but did not show apoptosis with a similar reagent. To show that
SDC-1 was the target gene of n-3 LDL or DHA that was responsible
for the proapoptotic effect, SDC-1 siRNA was transfected into the
cells. SDC-1 gene silencing blocked the ability of n-3 LDL and DHA
to promote apoptosis, thus confirming a role for SDC-1 in n-3
PUFA–induced apoptosis in the breast cancer cells.
The present study verified SDC-1 as a novel PPARg target gene.
We had previously shown that PPARg agonist troglitazone, DHA,
and n-3 LDL were effective stimulators of SDC-1 mRNA expression,
whereas PPARy agonist GW610742 had no effect. A PPARg
antagonist, GW259662, blocked the effect of n-3 LDL on SDC-1
expression (14). To confirm and further clarify the involvement
of PPARg in n-3 LDL and DHA regulation of SDC-1, we first used
a d/n PPARg cDNA, which effectively eliminated the up-regulation
of SDC-1 mRNA by n-3 LDL and DHA. Second, studies were
undertaken to show that whereas the n-3 PUFA had no detectable
effects on PPARg message and protein levels, a significant increase
in PPARg activity was measured by reporter assays. To obtain direct
evidence for a coupling mechanism between n-3 PUFA and PPARg
in SDC-1 gene up-regulation, we constructed a luciferase reporter
gene under the control of either the wild-type [pGL3-(DR-1)WT] or
mutant [pGL3-(DR-1)Mut] DR-1 element from the SDC-1 promoter
and investigated whether the activity of PPARg was enhanced by
n-3 PUFA to regulate expression of SDC-1. DHA, n-3 LDL, and
troglitazone significantly increased activity of luciferase in cells
transfected with wild-type SDC-1 DR-1-luciferase genes. Cotransfection of the same reporter with d/n PPARg cDNA inhibited
activity and the transfected reporter construct containing a mutant
SDC-1 DR-1 site was not responsive to n-3 LDL, DHA, and

troglitazone. DHA, n-3 LDL, and troglitazone had no effect on
luciferase activity in MCF-7 cells transfected with empty pGL3promoter vector. Anisfeld et al. (33), using a similar strategy,
identified SDC-1 as a target gene for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)
in hepatocytes. Although FXR is not expressed in breast epithelial
cells, our data are consistent with those studies because the DR-1
element in the proximal promoter of SDC-1 is recognized by several
nuclear hormone receptors, including the PPARs. PPARg is directly
activated by fatty acids to regulate gene expression (49, 50);
however, our study is the first to show the functional coupling of
an n-3 PUFA and PPARg in up-regulation of SDC-1 and thence
SDC-1–dependent apoptosis.
PPARg ligands have been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety
of tumor cells, including human breast cancer cells (41). Thus, the
dose-dependent increase in apoptosis of MCF-7 cells caused by
troglitazone was not unexpected. The important new finding from
our studies was that transfection of the cells with SDC-1 siRNA
blocked apoptosis induction by both troglitazone and DHA or n-3
LDL. This indicates that the target gene SDC-1 is required for the
proapoptotic activity of PPARg and that n-3 LDL and DHA
promote apoptosis through a SDC-1–dependent pathway.
In summary, the data presented in this work highlight a novel
pathway in which n-3 LDL or DHA promotes apoptosis of human
breast cancer cells. Further studies are needed to delineate the
pathway by which SDC-1 promotes apoptosis of the MCF-7 cells
and to identify other participants in this process.
