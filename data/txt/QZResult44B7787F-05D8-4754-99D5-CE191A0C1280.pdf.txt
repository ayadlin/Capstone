Abstract
In non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, acquired
resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) can occur through a generation of bypass signals such
as MET or AXL activation. In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity of NPS-1034, a newly developed
drug that targets both MET and AXL, in NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to geﬁtinib or erlotinib (HCC827/GR
and HCC827/ER, respectively). Characterization of H820 cells and evaluation of NPS-1034 efﬁcacy in these cells
were also performed. The resistance of HCC827/GR was mediated by MET activation, whereas AXL activation led
to resistance in HCC827/ER. The combination of geﬁtinib or erlotinib with NPS-1034 synergistically inhibited cell
proliferation and induced cell death in both resistant cell lines. Accordingly, suppression of Akt was noted only in
the presence of treatment with both drugs. NPS-1034 was also effective in xenograft mouse models of HCC827/GR.
Although the H820 cell line was reported previously to have T790M and MET ampliﬁcation, we discovered that
AXL was also activated in this cell line. There were no antitumor effects of siRNA or inhibitors speciﬁc for EGFR or
MET, whereas combined treatment with AXL siRNA or NPS-1034 and EGFR-TKIs controlled H820 cells,
suggesting that AXL is the main signal responsible for resistance. In addition, NPS-1034 inhibited cell proliferation
as well as ROS1 activity in HCC78 cells with ROS1 rearrangement. Our results establish the efﬁcacy of NPS-1034 in
NSCLC cells rendered resistant to EGFR-TKIs because of MET or AXL activation or ROS1 rearrangement. Cancer

Introduction
The efﬁcacy of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), such as geﬁtinib and erlotinib, in
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy has been demonstrated (1, 2). Their clinical beneﬁts are clearly observed,
especially in patients with EGFR mutations, such as G719A on
exon 18, a deletion mutation on exon 19 and L858R on exon 21
(3, 4). The remarkable response of cancer cells with EGFR
mutations to EGFR-TKIs may be explained by their dependency on EGFR signaling for growth and survival, the so-called
"oncogene addiction" (5–7). However, despite an excellent

initial response, drug resistance eventually develops in the
majority of patients, limiting the mean drug–response duration to less than 1 year (8, 9).
Several resistance mechanisms, including the secondary
T790M mutation and MET ampliﬁcation, have been identiﬁed
to date. The T790M mutation induces conformational changes
in the ATP-binding pocket of EGFR, leading to reduced afﬁnity
for small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors or enhanced ATP
binding afﬁnity in oncogenic-mutated EGFR (10). MET ampliﬁcation contributes to the acquisition of resistance to EGFRTKIs (11) because it is a redundant pathway for the activation
of PI3K/Akt signaling that facilitates the survival of cancer
cells, thus by-passing the inhibition of upstream EGFR signaling in the presence of EGFR-TKIs. Interestingly, both mechanisms have been observed simultaneously in some patients.
Clinical studies have disclosed that the T790M EGFR mutation
is responsible for EGFR-TKI resistance in about 50% patients,
whereas MET ampliﬁcation is involved in an additional 5% of
patients (8, 11–13).
AXL belongs to the TAM (Tyro-Axl-Mer) receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) family and is characterized by 2 immunoglobulinlike domains, dual ﬁbronectin type II repeats in the extracellular domain. Its ligands are vitamin K–dependent proteins,
such as growth arrest-speciﬁc 6 (Gas6) and protein S (14). TAM
signaling is related to cell survival, proliferation, migration, and
phagocytosis (15–17) and may affect the downstream PI3K/

Akt and Janus kinase–STAT signaling pathways (18, 19).
Recently, AXL has been a focus of research in the ﬁeld of
targeted therapy after its identiﬁcation as a "tyrosine kinase
switch" that induces resistance (20–22). We showed previously
that AXL contributes to the survival of EGFR-mutant lung
cancer cells in a manner similar to that observed for MET (23).
Increased AXL expression was found in approximately 20% of
patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, as assessed by
comparison of pre- and post-TKI tumor samples.
In this context, we expect that a drug targeting both MET
and AXL would be very useful in patients with acquired
resistance to EGFR-TKIs not caused by T790M. This study
aimed to assess the efﬁcacy of NPS-1034, a newly developed
synthetic MET and AXL inhibitor, in NSCLC cells with
resistance to EGFR-TKIs via the bypass signals of MET or
AXL.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
The human NSCLC cell lines HCC827 and H820 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing
10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 100 units/mL of penicillin
and streptomycin, and maintained at 37 C in a humidiﬁed
chamber containing 5% CO2. Erlotinib, geﬁtinib, and PHA665752 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals.
Establishment of geﬁtinib- and erlotinib-resistant cell
lines
Erlotinib-resistant cell lines were established in a previous
study (23). Geﬁtinib-resistant variants of HCC827 were isolated
by exposure to stepwise increasing doses of geﬁtinib. Brieﬂy,
HCC827 cells were treated with 10 nmol/L (the approximate
IC50 dose) geﬁtinib for 72 hours in RPMI 1650 medium containing 10% FBS. Subsequently, cells were cultured in drug-free
medium until 80% conﬂuence. Cells were continuously
exposed to increasing drug doses up to 1 mmol/L more than
8 months. The established resistant cell lines were maintained
in medium containing 1 mmol/L geﬁtinib. For all in vitro
studies, resistant cells were maintained in geﬁtinib- or erlotinib-free medium for at least 2 weeks before experiments, to
eliminate the effects of the drugs. Geﬁtinib-resistant cells are
referred to as HCC827/GR.

for 24 hours. Absorbance at 595 nm was read spectrophotometrically using a microplate reader.
To validate the long-term effects of a combination of EGFRTKIs and NPS-1034, cells were treated with the indicated doses
of drugs for 72 hours, and the medium was replaced with drugfree medium. After incubation for 5 days, attached cells were
stained with a 0.2% trypan blue solution containing 50%
methanol. The plate was washed under running tap water and
allowed to dry. The viability (living and dead cells) of cells was
determined using an ADAM-MC automatic cell counter
(NanoEnTek), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The combination effect was evaluated by MTT assay at a 1:1
ratio of each drug. CI values were processed using the CalcuSyn
software (Biosoft). CI values <1, ¼ 1, and >1 indicated synergism, additive effect, and antagonism, respectively.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in buffer containing 137 mmol/L NaCl, 15
mmol/L EGTA, 0.1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 15 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mmol/L MOPS, 100 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, and 20 mmol/L leupeptin,
adjusted to pH 7.2. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes
(Millipore). Antibodies speciﬁc for p-EGFR (Tyr1173), EGFR,
MET, p-Akt (Ser 473), Akt, ERK, P-Tyr (PY99), and actin were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; those for p-MET
(Tyr1234/1235), p-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), caspase-3, and PARP1 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology; and those
for p-AXL and AXL were purchased from R&D system. To
evaluate the level of phosphorylated AXL, lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-AXL antibody and immunoblotted
with an anti-phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) antibody. Proteins were
detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Kinase inhibition proﬁle
The in vitro NPS-1034 proﬁle of inhibition of RTKs was
analyzed using DiscoveRx and Carna Bioscience RTK assay
kits according to the manufacturer's protocols (see also the
protocol described in Supplementary Materials and Methods).

Small interfering RNA transfection
Silencer-validated small interfering RNAs (siRNA) for EGFR,
AXL, MET, and control were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. H820 cells were seeded into 60 mm dishes and
allowed to attach overnight. A 10 mL (100 nmol/L) aliquot of
siRNA solution (10 mmol/L) and 5 mL of the Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen) were each mixed with 100 mL
of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Solutions were incubated
for 20 minutes at room temperature after combining the 2
mixtures and added to the cells. After transfection, the suppression of targeted proteins was determined by Western
blotting. The viability of cells was determined by trypan blue
staining using an ADAM-MC automatic cell counter.

Cell viability assays
To perform the MTT assay, cells (0.5  104/well) were plated
in 96-well sterile plastic plates and allowed to attach overnight.
Cells were exposed to varying doses of geﬁtinib, erlotinib, PHA665752, and NPS-1034 in medium containing 1% FBS. After 72
hours, 15 mL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each
well and plates were incubated for 4 hours. Crystalline formazan was solubilized with 100 mL of a 10% (w/v) SDS solution

In vivo study
Female severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID) mice (17–
20 g, 6 weeks of age) were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories. Tumors were grown by implanting 5  106 cells
in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) into the mouse ﬂanks. Treatment
of 5 mice per group was started when the tumors had reached
a volume of 50 to 100 mm3 with vehicle control, geﬁtinib (100
mg/kg, 5 days a week), NPS-1034 (10 mg/kg, 5 days a week),

PHA-665752 (12.5 mg/kg, 5 days a week), geﬁtinib plus PHA665752, or geﬁtinib plus NPS-1034. Geﬁtinib and NPS-1034 were
administered orally, and PHA-665752 was given intravenously
via tail vein injections. Treatment was stopped at the indicated
day and mice were followed-up for tumor recurrence. To
measure tumor size, the length (L) and width (W) of the tumor
were measured with calipers, and tumor volume (TV) was
calculated as TV ¼ (L  W2)/2. Immunohistochemical staining
was performed using a speciﬁc primary antibody (Ki-67; DakoCytomation), the EnVision Plus staining kit (DakoCytomation),
and the APO-Direct terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay kit (Millipore),
according to the suppliers' instructions. Quantitative analysis of
section staining was performed by counting immunopositive
cells in 5 arbitrarily selected ﬁelds at 40 magniﬁcation.

Results
Development of NPS-1034 and its kinase inhibition
proﬁle
We initially designed and synthesized NPS-1034 (Fig. 1) as a
MET inhibitor. However, we found that NPS-1034 also inhibited several other kinases, as assessed by the ATP competition
assay. As shown in Table 1, NPS-1034 showed signiﬁcant
inhibitory activity against AXL, CSF1R, DDR, FLT3, KIT,
MERTK, MET, MST1R, ROS, TIE1, and TRK in an assay that
used 1 mmol/L ATP. In particular, NPS-1034 inhibited AXL
(IC50, 10.3 nmol/L) and MET (IC50, 48 nmol/L, data not shown).
Using cellular phosphorylation assays, we conﬁrmed that NPS1034 inhibited other kinases, such as FLT3, KIT, and DDR1
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Although NPS-1034 has inhibitory
activity on various kinases, it may be most useful as a dual
inhibitor of AXL and MET.

continuous exposure of cells to geﬁtinib more than a period of
8 months. The resistant subline was designated HCC827/GR
and exhibited a 1,000-fold higher resistance to geﬁtinib than
the parental cells (geﬁtinib IC50, <0.01 mmol/L in HCC827 cells
and >10 mmol/L in HCC827/GR cells; Fig. 2A). Consistent with a
prior study, we also observed increased total MET protein and
gene ampliﬁcation in HCC827/GR cells (Fig. 2B and data not
shown). The combination of geﬁtinib and a MET inhibitor,
PHA 665752, effectively inhibited the growth of HCC827/GR
cells, whereas neither of the agents alone led to growth
inhibition (Fig. 2C, top). In addition, the combination of
geﬁtinib and NPS-1034 also effectively inhibited the growth
of HCC827/GR cells (Fig. 2C, bottom). A similar synergistic

phosphorylation, which was maintained in the presence of
geﬁtinib alone (Fig. 2D and E). Furthermore, treatment with a
combination of geﬁtinib and NPS-1034 induced caspase-3 and
PARP-1 cleavage, thus leading to enhanced cell death (Fig. 2F).
To evaluate further, the antitumor efﬁcacy of the combination of NPS-1034 or PHA-665752 with geﬁtinib, an HCC827/GR
tumor xenograft was established in SCID mice. PHA-665752
treatment was limited to 12 days to avoid the venous toxicity
associated with a longer administration of the drug (24).
Although a single treatment produced a slight decrease in
tumor growth, combined treatment resulted in substantial
growth inhibition (Fig. 3A). The efﬁcacy of tumor inhibition
was not signiﬁcantly different between geﬁtinib plus PHA665752 and geﬁtinib plus NPS-1034. Moreover, the inhibition of
tumor growth persisted in the combination groups for 10 days
after the discontinuation of the drugs. Consistent with the
observations about tumor size, the combination resume

(geﬁtinib plus PHA-665752 and geﬁtinib plus NPS-1034) led
to the inhibition of tumor proliferation and the induction of
apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, geﬁtinib plus NPS-1034
induced increased apoptosis to a greater extent than did
geﬁtinib plus PHA-665752.
Addition of NPS-1034 to erlotinib overcomes
AXL-mediated drug resistance
We reported recently that increased activation of AXL led to
EGFR-TKI resistance in HCC827/ER cells (23). This erlotinibresistant subline exhibited IC50 values for erlotinib that were
more than 1,000-fold larger than those of the parental HCC827
cells (Fig. 4A). The expression and activity of AXL was significantly increased in HCC827/ER cells, and NPS-1034 treatment
effectively inhibited its tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4B
and C). When HCC827/ER cells were treated with erlotinib
and PHA-665752 or erlotinib and NPS-1034; NPS-1034 restored

sensitivity to erlotinib, whereas PHA-665752 did not (Fig.
4D). Consistent with what was observed for HCC827/GR
cells, combined NPS-1034 and erlotinib treatment overcame
erlotinib resistance via the complete inhibition of signaling
downstream from EGFR (Fig. 4E and F). Although the
induction of cell death by the combination treatment was
not signiﬁcantly increased in this dose frame, a higher dose
of NPS-1034 (2.5 mmol/L) led to enhanced cell death (Supplementary Fig. S2).
NPS-1034 treatment enhances sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs
in H820 cells
A previous study showed that XL880 affected the viability of
H820 cells harboring a sensitizing deletion (del E746-E749)
mutation, the resistant T790M mutation, and MET ampliﬁcation (12). The role of MET in the resistance of H820 cells to
EGFR-TKIs was emphasized, as an irreversible EGFR inhibitor,
CL-387,785 (which has the capability to overcome T790Mmediated resistance), did not suppress the proliferation of
H820 cells. In agreement with a previous study (12), we also
observed that the H820 cell line was resistant to reversible
EGFR-TKIs (geﬁtinib and erlotinib) and to an irreversible
EGFR-TKI (afatinib; Supplementary Fig. S3). However, because
XL880 inhibited AXL as well as MET, we investigated whether
the overcoming effect of XL880 in this cell line was mediated by
suppression of MET. Unexpectedly, treatment with PHA665752, a relatively speciﬁc MET inhibitor, failed to overcome
the resistance to geﬁtinib or erlotinib, whereas a combination
treatment with NPS-1034 exerted signiﬁcant effects (Fig. 5A
and B). This differential effect led us to evaluate both MET and
AXL in H820 cells. The levels of expression and activation of
MET in H820 cells were consistent with data published previously (12). Interestingly, AXL was highly expressed and
activated in H820 cells, similar to what was observed in
HCC827/ER cells (Fig. 5C and D).
To identify the major factor involved in resistance to geﬁtinib or erlotinib, we transfected H820 cells with EGFR, MET, or
AXL siRNAs, followed by geﬁtinib or erlotinib treatment. As
shown in Fig. 5E and F, each siRNA effectively suppressed the
targeted gene, but did not result in signiﬁcant inhibition of cell
growth. However, we found that AXL siRNA-transfected H820
cells became the most sensitive to the effects of geﬁtinib or
erlotinib. NPS-1034 treatment inhibited MET as well as AXL
activity in H820 cells, and a combined treatment with EGFRTKIs completely suppressed EGFR downstream signaling and
led to enhanced cell death (Fig. 5G and H). These results
indicate that AXL makes the major contribution to the resistance to EGFR-TKIs observed in H820 cells.
NPS-1034 inhibits ROS1 activity and cell proliferation in
HCC78 cells
We observed that NPS-1034 inhibited ROS1 activity (Table
1). Therefore, we examined whether NPS-1034 can inhibit ROS1
activity and cell proliferation in HCC78 cells with a ROS1
rearrangement. As shown in Fig. 6A, NPS-1034 treatment
inhibited cell proliferation so that the degree of growth inhibition was similar to that produced by crizotinib. Although the
efﬁcacy of growth inhibition was not different for the 2 drugs,

www.aacrjournals.org

NPS-1034 exhibited more potent inhibition of ROS1 activity
than crizotinib (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that NPS-1034
is a candidate for clinical application to the treatment of
NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement.

Discussion
We observed that the resistance mechanisms to several
EGFR-TKIs share common pathways, such as the induction
of steric hindrance of drug binding by secondary mutations
and the activation of redundant pathways to maintain downstream signals in case of blocking main addicted signaling
pathway, although the speciﬁc mutations and bypass signals
may differ. Our study demonstrated that NPS-1034 is effective
in NSCLC cells with resistance to EGFR-TKIs via the bypass
signals of MET or AXL.
AXL was identiﬁed as a "tyrosine kinase switch" that causes
imatinib resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).
Imatinib-resistant GIST cells alter their survival signal from cKIT to AXL and overexpress its ligand, Gas6 (22). In addition to
preclinical evidence, downregulation of c-KIT and activation of
AXL were conﬁrmed in GIST patients displaying resistance to
imatinib. Furthermore, overexpression of AXL conferred drug
resistance in acute myeloid leukemia, and was induced after
exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs (20). Liu and colleagues
reported that AXL overexpression constitutes a novel mechanism of lapatinib resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer
cells. An siRNA against AXL restored the sensitivity to lapatinib
in these resistant cells (21). Thus, AXL seems to be an important redundant RTK that induces resistance to many targeted
agents, especially when we also consider that our previous
study demonstrated its role in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells with
acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
H820 cells harbor the sensitizing EGFR deletion mutation in
exon 19, the T790M mutation, as well as MET ampliﬁcation
(12). H820 cells are not responsive to EGFR-TKIs, although
these cells were isolated from a patient who had never been
exposed to that type of drug. Because irreversible EGFR-TKIs
were reported to be active against T790M, and H820 cells
exhibit resistance to both erlotinib and an irreversible EGFR
inhibitor (CL-387, 785), a previous report suggested that
T790M does not contribute to resistance in H820 cells (12).
This is possible, as we have observed that a low level of T790M
is not sufﬁcient to cause resistance, and that the T790M allele is
present at a frequency of only 7% in H820 cells, as assessed
using a scorpion-ampliﬁcation refractory mutation system,
compared with 55% in H1975 cells, in which T790M is the
main resistance mechanism (10). Furthermore, we showed
that speciﬁc inhibition of EGFR by siRNA had only a marginal
growth-inhibitory effect on H820 cells, indicating that these
cells may escape from EGFR dependency and use signals other
than EGFR.
However, H820 cells are sensitive to XL880, which has a
potent activity against MET (10). Based on studies of the
characteristics of H820 cells, Bean and colleagues concluded
that MET alteration is the main resistance mechanism, that it
occurs independently of T790M mutations, and that MET may
be a relevant therapeutic target in these cells. Although some of
these theories are valid, data from our experiments showed

Figure 5. Correlation between AXL activation and resistance to EGFR-TKIs in H820 cells. A and B, H820 cells were treated with geﬁtinib, erlotinib,
PHA-665752, NPS-1034, or a combination of the 2 drugs. Combined effects were measured using the MTT assay. C and D, the basal levels of proteins
and endogenous activities of AXL were determined by Western blotting. E and F, H820 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA and gene
knockdown was conﬁrmed by Western blotting (E). After transfection, cells were treated with the indicated drugs (100 nmol/L) for 48 hours and then
counted (F). Results are representative of at least 3 independent experiments, and the error bars signify standard deviations ( SDs).  , P < 0.01 and

cells were treated with the indicated drugs. After 48 hours, cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting using the antibodies described in
the ﬁgure (G). After 72 hours, cell death was assessed as described in Materials and Methods (H). Results are representative of at least three independent
experiments, and the error bars signify standard deviations ( SDs).   , P < 0.001 for the combination of geﬁtinib or erlotinib plus NPS-1034 versus

that H820 cell proliferation was not inhibited by a combination
of erlotinib and another MET inhibitor (PHA665752), raising
doubts about whether MET constitutes the main resistance
mechanism in these cells. We established another geﬁtinibresistant HCC827 cell line (HCC827/GR) with characteristics
similar to those generated by Engelman and colleagues (11).
This cell line displayed MET ampliﬁcation without AXL activation, and its growth was inhibited by a combination treat-

ment with geﬁtinib and PHA665752. This ﬁnding indicates that
PHA665752 is sufﬁcient to overcome the resistance induced by
the MET bypass signal. Therefore, the different effects of XL880
and PHA665752 on H820 cell proliferation do not seem to be
caused by their ability to inhibit MET. Rather, other targets of
XL880, such as AXL and VEGFR, may be the real cause of
resistance, considering that XL880 is a multikinase inhibitor.
We revealed for the ﬁrst time that AXL expression is also

AXL and MET Inhibition in Resistance to EGFR Inhibitor

doses of crizotinib or NPS-1034 for
72 hours. The viability of cells was

increased in H820 cells, and that cell proliferation is suppressed
by NPS-1034, but not by a speciﬁc MET inhibitor, which
provides additional evidence in support of a possible role for
AXL in resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
Interestingly, the majority of signals examined, including
EGFR, Her2, and Her3, were downregulated in HCC827/ER
cells (data not shown). Nevertheless, the EGFR signal seems to
be important, as the single inhibition of AXL via XL880 or
siRNA transfection failed to suppress cell proliferation sufﬁciently in erlotinib-resistant cells. Both inhibition of EGFR and
AXL effectively modulated cell viability and Akt phosphorylation, indicating that the signaling pathway involved in cell
survival is not completely switched from EGFR to AXL, and
that both signals may contribute to the survival and proliferation of erlotinib-resistant cells. Disappointingly, we failed to
establish a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model using
HCC827/ER cells. It is not certain whether the downregulation
of many signals led to engraftment failure of these cells in the
mouse.
As shown in Table 1, NPS-1034 is a multikinase inhibitor.
Among its targets, ROS1 was identiﬁed recently as an oncogenic driver of NSCLC in the case of fusion with TPM3, SDC4,
SLC34A2, EZR, and CD74 (25, 26). Lung cancer with ROS1
rearrangement represents a unique, clinically important subset, although its prevalence seems to be less than 5% of NSCLC.
Bergethon and colleagues reported a dramatic response in a
patient with ROS1 rearrangement to treatment with crizotinib,
which is a multikinase inhibitor that targets MET, AXL, and
ROS1 and is currently being used to treat NSCLC with ALK
rearrangement (27, 28). We found that NPS-1034 is more active

than crizotinib in inhibiting ROS1 activity, suggesting its
possible clinical application to the treatment of NSCLC with
ROS1 rearrangement.
In conclusion, NPS-1034 is a very active agent in EGFRmutant NSCLC with resistance to EGFR-TKIs via the bypass
signals of MET or AXL and in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC.
