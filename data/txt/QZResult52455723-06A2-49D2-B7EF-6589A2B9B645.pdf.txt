ABSTRACT
Both erbB3 and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) have been shown to play an important
role in trastuzumab resistance. However, it remains unclear whether erbB3- and IGF1R-initiated signaling pathways possess distinct effects on the sensitivity of lapatinib,
a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor against both EGFR and erbB2, in trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer. Here, we show that the trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3-pool2 and
BT474-HR20 breast cancer sublines, as compared the parental SKBR3 and BT474
cells, respectively, exhibit refractoriness to lapatinib. Knockdown of erbB3 inhibited
Akt in SKBR3-pool2 and BT474-HR20 cells, significantly increased lapatinib efficacy,
and dramatically re-sensitized the cells to lapatinib-induced apoptosis. In contrast,
specific knockdown of IGF-1R did not alter the cells’ responsiveness to lapatinib. While
the levels of phosphorylated Src (P-Src) were reduced upon IGF-1R downregulation,
the P-Akt levels remained unchanged. Furthermore, a specific inhibitor of Akt, but not
Src, significantly enhanced lapatinib-mediated anti-proliferative/anti-survival effects
on SKBR3-pool2 and BT474-HR20 cells. These data indicate that erbB3 signaling is
critical for both trastuzumab and lapatinib resistances mainly through the PI-3K/Akt
pathway, whereas IGF-1R-initiated Src activation results in trastuzumab resistance
without affecting lapatinib sensitivity. Our findings may facilitate the development of
precision therapeutic regimens for erbB2-positive breast cancer patients who become
resistant to erbB2-targeted therapy.

growth factor receptor (EGFR) and erbB2. Because
the majority of erbB2-overexpressing (erbB2-positive)
breast cancer cells express little or basal levels of
EGFR, lapatinib mainly inhibits erbB2 kinase activity
(intracellular domain) in erbB2-positive breast cancers.
Another erbB2-targeted therapy, trastuzumab (Herceptin)
is a humanized monoclonal antibody (Ab) binding to the
extracellular domain of erbB2. Both trastuzumab and
lapatinib have been successfully used in clinic to treat
early and metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with
erbB2-positive tumors [3–8]. However, both de novo and
acquired resistance to these agents frequently occurs,
representing a significant clinical problem [9–12].

INTRODUCTION
One of the most well characterized oncogenes
involved in breast carcinogenesis is erbB2 (or HER2/neu).
Gene amplification/overexpression of erbB2 is observed
in approximately 25–30% of invasive breast cancers and
significantly associated with a worse prognosis [1, 2].
The erbB2 receptor has no known ligand. It may become
activated by overexpression via either homodimerization
or heterodimerization with another receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK). ErbB2 is therefore an ideal target for
breast cancer treatment. Lapatinib (or Tykerb) is a small
molecule inhibitor, and dual targets both the epidermal

trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer observed by Zhang et
al [31] and Liang et al [33] affects lapatinib sensitivity.
Finally, both erbB3- and IGF-1R-initiated
signaling pathways have been shown to be involved in
trastuzumab resistance [39–41]. We previously reported
that the erbB2 receptor simultaneously interacted with
erbB3 and IGF-1R to form a heterotrimeric complex
in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells [42]. This
interaction enhanced activation of the PI-3K/Akt signaling
and Src kinase. Specific knockdown of either erbB3 or
IGF-1R significantly reversed this resistance capacity,
suggesting that both erbB3 and IGF-1R contributed to
trastuzumab resistance [42]. Here, we take advantage of
the same cell models to determine if the trastuzumabresistant breast cancer cells become refractory to lapatinib,
and to explore whether erbB3- and IGF-1R-initiated
signaling pathways differentially modulate lapatinib
sensitivity.

A number of studies suggest that lapatinib resistance
arises via mechanisms similar to those contributing to
trastuzumab resistance. For instance, activation of the
signaling pathways initiated by other erbB receptors, such
as EGFR and erbB3, can impair the anti-proliferative
effects of lapatinib [13–16]. Compensatory signaling
activation resulting from other RTKs outside of the
erbB family, such as AXL, may also cause resistance
to lapatinib [17]. In addition, upregulation of survivin,
the smallest member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)
family, has been identified as a contributor to lapatinib
resistance [18]. Some non-overlapping mechanisms
of resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib likely exist
in erbB2-positive breast cancers, as lapatinib has been
approved by the FDA to treat erbB2-positive MBC that
has progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy [19]. In
fact, increasing evidence suggests that lapatinib and
trastuzumab do not share common mechanisms of
resistance, since lapatinib has activity in trastuzumabresistant breast cancer [20–23]. These conclusions are
supported by clinical data showing improved outcomes
derived from inflammatory breast cancer patients [24].
For example, the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway is a major
determinant of trastuzumab resistance in breast cancers
[25], whereas its role in lapatinib resistance remains
controversial. One study has shown that loss of PTEN
and the resulting activation of PI-3K/Akt signaling lead
to lapatinib resistance, and this can be reversed by the
mTOR/PI-3K inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 [26]. Others report
that activation of PI-3K/Akt signaling confers resistance to
trastuzumab but not lapatinib [27, 28] and lapatinib exerts
anti-tumor activity in a PTEN independent manner [29].
Wang et al have shown that estrogen receptor (ER) and
erbB2 reactivation play important roles in the differential
resistance of trastuzumab as compared to lapatinib [30].
A recent report has identified the non-receptor
tyrosine kinase Src as a crucial mediator of trastuzumab
resistance in erbB2-positive breast cancers [31]. It
shows that loss of PTEN or overexpression of another
RTK, such as the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor
(IGF-1R), EGFR, or erbB3 induces activation of Src
and thereby promotes trastuzumab resistance in a
PI-3K/Akt-dependent or -independent manner [32].
These observations have been supported by the studies
indicating that administration of erythropoietin induces
Jak2-mediated activation of Src and PTEN inactivation,
reducing trastuzumab efficacy [33]. Thus, Src activation
appears to be a key mechanism of trastuzumab
resistance and predicts for poor prognosis mainly in
erbB2-positive/ER-negative breast cancer [34]. Several
studies have also found that activation of Src causes
lapatinib resistance [35, 36], more specifically activated
Src is upregulated in β1-integrin- and mTORC1-mediated
resistance to lapatinib in erbB2-positive breast cancer
cells [37, 38]. However, whether Src activation may cause
cross-resistance to both trastuzumab and lapatinib remains
unclear. It is not known whether the activation of Src in

RESULTS
Trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer sublines are
less sensitive than the parental lines to lapatinibinduced growth inhibition and apoptosis
To determine the lapatinib efficacy against
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells, we used SKBR3pool2 and BT474-HR20 sublines derived from SKBR3 and
BT474 breast cancer cells, respectively. As compared to
the parental lines, the trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3-pool2
and BT474-HR20 cells were significantly less sensitive to
lapatinib-induced growth inhibition (Figure 1A). The IC50
values of lapatinib were approximately 0.043 μmol/L ±
0.003 in SKBR3 cells vs 0.15 μmol/L ± 0.003 in SKBR3pool2 cells, and 0.054 μmol/L ± 0.009 in BT474 cells vs
0.12 μmol/L ± 0.006 in BT474-HR20 cells (P < 0.05).
While lapatinib induced profound PARP cleavage and
activation of caspase-3, the hallmarks of apoptosis, and
histone-associated DNA fragmentation in both SKBR3
and BT474 cells, less PARP cleavage and caspase-3
activation and significantly reduced DNA fragments were
observed in their trastuzumab-resistant counterparts upon
lapatinib treatment (Figure 1B & 1C). These data indicate
that trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells are refractory
to lapatinib-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis.

Specific knockdown of erbB3, but not IGF-1R,
inhibits proliferation of the trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer cells associated with cell
cycle G1 arrest and significantly promotes
lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis
We have reported that both erbB3- and
IGF-1R-initiated signaling pathways contribute to
trastuzumab resistance [42]. Thus, we examined whether
the two receptors might also modulate the inhibitory effects

of lapatinib on SKBR3-pool2 and BT474-HR20 cells. The
cells were infected with the lentivirus containing control,
erbB3, or IGF-1R shRNA for specific gene silencing.
We first performed western blot assays, showing that the
shRNA sequences we used were specific to knockdown
their corresponding receptors (Figure 2A, inserts). While
knockdown of erbB3 significantly reduced cell growth,
specific downregulation of IGF-1R had no effect on
proliferation of the cells (Figure 2A). Flow cytometry
analysis revealed that the erbB3 shRNA (erbB3shRNA)
increased cell population in G1 phase of the cell cycle
and decreased the percentage of cells in S phase, whereas
the shRNA for IGF-1R (IGF-1RshRNA) did not alter cell
cycle distribution as compared to control shRNA (Figure
2B). Furthermore, specific knockdown of erbB3 expression
was able to significantly re-sensitize the resistant cells to
lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition (Figure 3A). This
dramatic reduction might also be attributed to the significant
inhibitory effects-caused by specific knockdown of erbB3
expression (Figure 2A). However, specific knockdown
of IGF-1R expression showed no significant impact on
lapatinib-induced inhibitory effects on SKBR3-pool2 and
BT474-HR20 cells (Figure 3B).
We next investigated the influence of erbB3 receptor
and IGF-1R on lapatinib-induced apoptosis in trastuzumabresistant breast cancer cells. The efficiency and specificity of
the erbB3 shRNA and IGF-1R shRNA were demonstrated
previously [42] and further confirmed in the current study
(Figures 2A & 4A). While lapatinib treatment did not
affect the expression levels of IGF-1R, it clearly increased
erbB3 levels in both SKBR3-pool2 and BT474-HR20 cells
(Figure 4A). This observation is in agreement with a recent
report showing that lapatinib can induce a compensatory
upregulation of erbB3 in erbB2-positive breast cancer
cells [14]. More importantly, specific knockdown of erbB3
significantly enhanced lapatinib-induced apoptosis, evidenced
by increased PARP cleavage, activation of caspase-8 and -3,
and histone-associated DNA fragmentation (Figure 4A & 4B).
In contrast, IGF-1R knockdown had no effect on lapatinibinduced apoptosis. Additional studies with live/dead imaging
assays revealed that the erbB3 shRNA in combination
with lapatinib exhibited a profound cell killing activity as
compared to either lapatinib treatment or erbB3 shRNA
alone (Figure 4C). Collectively, our studies demonstrate that
erbB3 receptor and IGF-1R differentially modulate lapatinib
sensitivity in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells; and
specific knockdown of erbB3, but not IGF-1R, significantly
promotes lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis.

IGF-1R in SKBR3-pool2 and BT474-HR20 cells. Specific
inhibitors of either Akt or Src were able to abrogate the
trastuzumab resistant phenotype [42], consistent with
recent studies showing that both PI-3K/Akt signaling and
Src kinase are critically involved in trastuzumab resistance
[25, 31, 32]. We wondered whether erbB3 receptor and
IGF-1R equally initiated activation of the PI-3K/Akt
signaling and Src kinase, which might also influence the
lapatinib sensitivity of trastuzumab-resistant cells. We
found that specific knockdown of erbB3 dramatically
decreased the levels of P-Akt, and to a less extent P-Src,
in both SKBR3-pool2 and BT474-HR20 cells. In contrast,
IGF-1R knockdown only gave rise to a reduction of P-Src
(Figure 5). Treatment with lapatinib alone dramatically
reduced P-Akt levels in both cell lines, inhibited P-MAPK
(Erk1/2) in SKBR3-pool2 cells; and it had a minor
effect on P-Src. Interestingly, lapatinib combined with
downregulation of erbB3, but not IGF-1R, exhibited a
most profound inhibition on P-Akt, P-Src, and P-MAPK
(Erk1/2) in both cell lines. Our data suggest that erbB3 and
IGF-1R initiate distinct signaling pathways contributing to
trastuzumab resistance - erbB3 activates both PI-3K/Akt
signaling and Src kinase, whereas IGF-1R mainly elicits
Src activation.

Inhibition of Akt, but not Src, significantly
enhances lapatinib-induced growth inhibition,
long-term suppressive effects on colony
formation, and apoptosis in trastuzumabresistant breast cancer cells
We next focused on studying if the PI-3K/Akt
signaling and Src kinase also influenced the refractoriness
of lapatinib displayed by the trastuzumab-resistant cells.
Specific inhibitor of either Akt or Src was used. Our
previous studies [43] showed that the Akt1/2 kinase
inhibitor (Akti) at 0.5 – 1.0 μmol/L was sufficient to
reduce the P-Akt levels in SKBR3 cells with ectopic
expression of erbB3. Since we had no experience with
the Src inhibitor (Srci) Saracatinib, we first performed
preliminary studies and discovered that the Srci at 0.2
μmol/L clearly decreased P-Src, whereas it had no effect
on P-Akt (Supplementary Figure S1). Thus, 0.5 μmol/L
of Akti and 0.2 μmol/L of Srci were used in the following
studies. Treatment with lapatinib alone decreased P-Akt
levels in both BT474-HR20 and SKBR3-pool2 cells, and
reduced P-Src only in SKBR3-pool2 cells (Figure 6A).
Lapatinib in combination with Akti eliminated P-Akt
and had little effect on P-Src in both cell lines, whereas
lapatinib in combination with Srci abolished P-Src and
resulted in no further reduction of P-Akt than lapatinib
alone (Figure 6A). These data suggest that the inhibitors
we used were potent and specific. Interestingly, while Akti
or Srci alone had little effect on cell growth (Figure 6B),
Akti significantly enhanced lapatinib-mediated growth
inhibition and long-term suppression of colony formation

Downregulation of erbB3 mainly reduces the levels
of phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt), whereas IGF-1R
knockdown leads to a decrease of P-Src levels
Enhanced activation of the downstream signaling
pathways, including PI-3K/Akt and Src kinase, were
observed upon the hetrotrimerization of erbB2/erbB3/

the combinations of lapatinib and Srci elicited a similar
inhibitory effect as lapatinib alone on cell growth and

showed a concentration dependent additional inhibitory
effect, i.e. lapatinib plus various concentrations of Akti
dramatically shifted the cells’ responsive curves as

breast cancer biology, but also provide a basis for rational
design of precision medicines to overcome resistance. As a
dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor against both EGFR and erbB2
[46], lapatinib has been approved to treat the erbB2-positive
breast cancer patients that have progressed on trastuzumabbased regimens [19]. Lapatinib is able to inhibit the PI-3K/
Akt and MEK/MAPK signaling [47] and downregulate the
expression of survivin [48]. Unfortunately, the efficacy of
lapatinib is also compromised by resistance [10, 49]. The
molecular mechanisms of lapatinib resistance are not well
understood. We have shown that activation of erbB3 and
IGF-1R, the downstream PI-3K/Akt signaling, and Src
kinase contributes to trastuzumab resistance [42]. Here, we
utilized the same cell models and found that the erbB3/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, but not IGF-1R/Src activation,
influenced the efficacy of lapatinib. We noticed that the
concentrations of lapatinib we used were well below the
peak plasma concentration (~1.5 μmol/L) or steady-state
concentration (~0.5 μmol/L) of lapatinib detected in patients
[50]. We showed that, by comparison, the trastuzumabresistant sublines SKBR3-pool2 and BT474-HR20 were
significantly less sensitive to lapatinib than their parental
SKBR3 and BT474 cells, respectively. Our data simply
suggest that trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells may

DISCUSSION
Despite many important findings that have been
reported on the underlying mechanisms of resistance to
trastuzumab [11] and lapatinib [10], a number of dilemmas
remain [44, 45]: 1) It is unclear if resistance mechanisms
for all erbB2-targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab and
lapatinib, are similar; 2) There are no accurate methods
to identify which breast cancer patients may benefit
from, or be resistant to erbB2-targeted therapeutics
selected; 3) We lack reliable biomarkers to predict the
efficacy of trastuzumab and lapatinib against erbB2positive breast cancer. Thus, more detailed studies on
the underlying mechanisms of trastuzumab and lapatinib
resistances should not only further our understanding of

exhibit refractory to lapatinib at certain extend. In addition,
our studies were carried out under a 2-D cell culture system,
in which the cancer cells were directly exposed to lapatinib.
In the treatment of patients, it is difficult to tell how much of
the plasma lapatinib actually gets into the microenvironment
of solid tumors.
Our findings are consistent with the recent discovery
that compensatory upregulation of erbB3 may be
phosphorylated (activated) by residual erbB2, maintaining
signaling through P-Akt. This limits the antitumor activity
of lapatinib [14], and the PI-3K hyperactivation results in

lapatinib resistance which can be reversed by the mTOR/PI3K inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 [26]. Our data do not support an
earlier report showing that the cytotoxic effects of lapatinib
were further enhanced by the IGF-1R blocking Ab alphaIR3
[51]. To further confirm our data, we also tested an antiIGF-1R Ab - IMC-A12, a fully human monoclonal IgG1
Ab against human IGF-1R, which is currently under clinical
trials (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=IMCA12&Search=Search) to determine whether we could
obtain the same results with the IGF-1R knockdown assays
(Figure 3). We discovered that IMC-A12 (A12) as well as

the Srci were able to significantly enhance trastuzumabmediated growth inhibition in both BT474-HR20 and
SKBR3-pool2 cells, consistent with our previous report [42].
However, neither A12 nor the Srci altered the two cell lines’
responsiveness to lapatinib (Supplementary Figure S3). These
results support our current data (Figures 3 & 6). Our findings,
distinct from the earlier study [51], might be explained by
the different Abs used. Another possibility may be due to
the developmental process of the trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer cells. SKBR3-pool2 cells were developed by
Dr. Esteva at MD Anderson Cancer Center. His laboratory
first discovered that IGF-1R formed heterodimerization
with erbB2 and later found that the IGF-1R blocking Ab
alphaIR3 increased lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition in
the resistant cell line [41, 51]. At that time, SKBR3-pool2
cells were maintained at 4 μg/ml of trastuzumab in the cell
culture condition, which may represent as the “early stage”
of trastuzumab resistance. Since we obtained the cell line
from Dr. Esteva, we continuously cultured SKBR3-pool2
cells by increasing the concentrations of trastuzumab (in
order to retain the same condition with BT474-HR20 cells).
The SKBR3-pool2 cells are now grown at 20 μg/ml of
trastuzumab in our cell culture system. It is possible that
the phenotype of this “late stage” of trastuzumab resistance
may be distinct from that of “early stage” of trastuzumab
resistance, because we not only found that activation of
IGF-1R signaling and Src kinase did not alter the efficacy
of lapatinib against BT474-HR20 and SKBR3-pool2 cells
(Figure 3 & Supplementary Figure S3), we also reported
that the erbB2 receptor actually interacted with both erbB3
and IGF-1R to form a heterotrimeric complex in the resistant
cells [42]. Nonetheless, more detailed studies are needed to
carefully examine the characteristics of “early stage” and
“late stage” resistance. In addition, our data are also different
from a recent study showing that Src is involved in acquired
resistance to lapatinib, and Src inhibitor (saracatinib)
restores the sensitivity of the resistant cells to lapatinib [35].
The resistant cell line (SKBR3-Lap-R) used in this study
was established through long term selection of SKBR3
cells in the presence of lapatinib (gradually increasing the
concentrations); and upregulation of CXCR4 had also been
shown to play a role in lapatinib resistance of SKBR3-Lap-R
cells. No change of CXCR4 expression was found in our
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells (data not shown).
Additional studies with the Src inhibitor (saracatinib)
revealed that inactivation of Src enhanced trastuzumab-, but
not lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition in both BT474HR20 and SKBR3-pool2 cells (Supplementary Figure S3),
further confirming our findings (Figure 6 & see ref 42).
Thus, it is conceivable to hypothesize that the underlying
mechanisms of cross-resistance to lapatinib caused by
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells may be different
from those of acquired resistance to lapatinib directly.
It is clear that the erbB3/PI-3K/Akt signaling
pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of
resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib. The current clinical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitors of PI-3K/Akt cannot completely block the
signaling pathway [14], and PI-3K inhibition may induce
a feedback upregulation of erbB3 [52]. Thus, effective
inhibition of erbB3 is thought to be required for optimal
antitumor activity of erbB2-targeted therapy. Our recent
studies identified the class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat
(SNDX-275 or MS-275) as a special agent to selectively
inhibit erbB3 leading to a dramatic reduction of P-Akt in
erbB2-positive breast cancer cells [53]. It is interesting and
in clinical relevance to study if entinostat and lapatinib may
exert synergistic or additive anti-proliferative/anti-survival
effects on trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells.
In summary, trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer
cells as compared to their parental controls are refractory
to lapatinib. While inhibition of erbB3 or Akt significantly
re-sensitizes the cells to lapatinib treatment, inhibition of
IGF-1R or Src kinase does not alter the cells’ sensitivity
to lapatinib. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report experimentally demonstrating that erbB3and IGF-1R-initiated signaling pathways differentially
modulate lapatinib efficacy against trastuzumab-resistant
cells. Our data provide a basis for rational design of novel
effective combinatorial regimens to overcome resistance
and thereby improve the survival of breast cancer patients
whose tumors overexpress erbB2 and become resistant to
erbB2-targeted therapy.

Cells and cell culture

(mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes) as previously
described [42, 43, 53]. This enzyme immunoassay was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Human breast cancer cell lines SKBR3 and BT474
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). The trastuzumab-resistant sublines
BT474-HR20 and SKBR3-pool2, derived from BT474
and SKBR3, respectively, were described previously [41,
42]. Cell line authentication was confirmed with DNA
profiling by University of Colorado Cancer Center’s DNA
Sequencing & Analysis Core facility in July 2010. All cell
lines were free of mycoplasma contamination, which was
determined by the MycoAlert™ Mycoplasma Detection
Kit (Lonza Group Ltd. Basel, Switzerland) every three
months. Both BT474-HR20 and SKBR3-pool2 cells were
maintained in the presence of 20 μg/ml of trastuzumab.
All cell lines were cultured with DMEM/F-12 (1:1)
medium (Sigma) containing 10% FBS (Sigma) in a 37°C
humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2
and split twice a week.

Western blot analysis
Protein expression levels were determined by
western blot analysis [54–56]. Equal amounts of total
cell lysates were boiled in Laemmli SDS-sample buffer,
resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA),
and probed with the primary antibodies described in
the figure legends. After the blots were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West
Grove, PA), the signals were detected using the enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences
Corp., Piscataway, NJ).

Live/dead cell staining

Cell proliferation assay

Live and dead cells were visualized by Live/Dead
Cell Imaging kit (Life Technologies Corp., Eugene, OR)
based on a cell permeable dye for staining of live cells
(green) and a cell impermeable dye for staining of the
dead cells (red). Cells were seeded in a 24-well plate
overnight, treated with lapatinib for 24 hr, and freshly
stained with Live/Dead Imaging kit exactly following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell images were
subsequently acquired under a Nikon light microscopy.

The CellTiter96 AQ nonradioactive cell proliferation
kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) was
used to determine cell viability [42, 43, 53]. Briefly, cells
were plated onto 96-well plates for 24 hr, and then grown
in either DMEM/F12 medium as control, or the same
medium containing different concentrations of lapatinib and
incubated for another 72 hr. After reading all wells at 490
nm with a microplate reader, the percentages of surviving
cells from each group relative to controls, defined as 100%
survival, were determined by reduction of MTS.

Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle

Specific knockdown of erbB3 or IGF-1R
expression with a lentiviral system

Flow cytometric analyses were performed to define
cell cycle distribution for treated and untreated cells
[54]. Briefly, cells grown in 100-mm culture dishes were
harvested and fixed with 70% ethanol. Cells were then
stained for total DNA content with a solution containing
50 μg /ml propidium iodide and 100 μg /ml RNase
I in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell cycle distribution
was analyzed at the Flow Cytometry Core Facility of
University of Colorado Cancer Center with a FAC Scan
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Lentiviral production and specific knockdown
of erbB3 or IGF-1R expression with a shRNA were
carried out as described previously [42, 53]. In brief, the
lentivirus-containing either control shRNA or erbB3/IGF1R specific shRNA were produced in 293T cells following
the standard procedure. The virus in conditioned medium
were harvested, aliquot, and stored at −80°C freezer.
Prior to infection, the lentivirus-containing media were
thawed completely at room temperature, and mixed with
a same amount of fresh medium containing polybrene (8
μg/ml). The culture media of the candidate breast cancer
cells were then replaced with the lentivirus-containing
media. After 24 hr, the virus-infected cells were selected
with puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 48 hr, and then subjected to
required experiments.

Colony formation assay
Colony formation assays were performed as
described previously [57]. In brief, cells at exponential
growth phase were harvested with trypsin-EDTA and
counted by a hemocytometer. Cells were diluted and
seeded at about 1000 cells per well of a twelve-well plate.
After 12 hr incubation, cells were untreated or treated
with lapatinib, and then continuously cultured with the
fresh media, which were changed every 3 days, for 14
days in a 37ºC humidified atmosphere containing 95%
air and 5% CO2. The cell colonies were stained for 15
min with a solution containing 0.5% crystal violet and
