nerves are regulated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nAChRs)[10]. On the other hand, the neurotransmitter
GABA serves as the physiological inhibitor of β-AR
signaling by blocking the activation of adenylyl cyclase
via the inhibitory G-protein (Gαi)-coupled GABAB
receptor [15].
First evidence for a regulatory role of β-ARs in
cancer cells was provided in 1989 by an in vitro study
that showed a significant increase in the proliferation
of human lung adenocarcinoma cells in response to the
β-AR agonist isoproterenol with the general β-blocker
propranolol inhibiting this response [16]. Later
investigations revealed similar epinephrine-induced
effects in these cells that were blocked by propranolol and
were depended on β-AR mediated increase in intracellular
cAMP [17]. Discoveries that the nicotine-derived and
highly carcinogenic nitrosamine (4)-methylnitrosamino1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is a high affinity agonist
for β1-and β2-ARs [18] as well as for nAChRs [19]
provided a first etiological link between the activation of
nAChR-regulated β-AR signaling and the development
of smoking-associated cancers. It has thus been shown
that NNK stimulates the proliferation of human lung
adenocarcinoma cells and their normal cells of origin, small
airway epithelial cells, via a cAMP-dependent signaling
cascade that includes activation of the transcription factor
CREB as well as the PKA-dependent transactivation of
the EGFR pathway and the β-AR-mediated release of AA
[9, 18, 20]. This signaling cascade was not only stimulated
by direct binding of NNK to β-ARs [18] but additionally
by the α7nAChR-mediated production of noradrenaline
and adrenaline in small airway epithelial cells and lung
adenocarcinoma cells [21]. These in vitro findings
were further corroborated by reports that epinephrine
promoted while propranolol inhibited the development
of NNK-induced lung adenocarcinomas in hamsters
[22]. In addition, chronic nicotine-induced progression of
xenografts from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line
was associated with increased systemic levels of stress

In the current issue of Oncotarget, a 10-year followup study by Powe et al. reports that women receiving betablocker therapy for hypertension showed a significant
reduction in breast cancer metastasis, recurrence and
mortality. These findings provide first clinical evidence
in support of earlier in vitro findings by the same
research group reporting significant norepinephrineinduced stimulation of cell migration that was inhibited
by the beta-blocker propranolol or by the γ-aminobutyric
acid (GABA)-mediated reduction in cAMP-dependent
signaling in cancer of the colon, prostate and breast [14]. Additional breast cancer-stimulating mechanisms that
may have been inhibited by beta-blocker therapy include
beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)-mediated proliferation
of cancer cells and the β-AR-mediated activation of the
arachidonic acid (AA) cascade as well as β-AR-mediated
modulation of G-protein inwardly rectifying K+-channels
observed in vitro studies by another laboratory [5, 6].
Collectively, these findings identify signal transduction
pathways downstream of β-ARs as important positive
regulators of progression and metastasis in these cancers
and represent a promising new target for the therapy and
prevention of such malignancies.
Beta-ARs are a family of G-protein coupled
receptors that initiate multiple signaling cascades,
including the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA/CREB
pathway which transactivates the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, the Src/STAT pathway
as well as the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade [7-11]. The
catecholamine stress neurotransmitters noradrenaline and
adrenaline (synonyms: norepinephrine and epinephrine)
are the physiological agonists for β-ARs [12]. These
neurotransmitters are not only released from the adrenal
medulla as a response to psychological and physical
stress but also regulate cell and organ responses to the
sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system [13,
14]. In turn, the synthesis and release of noradrenaline
and adrenaline in the adrenal medulla and sympathetic

neurotransmitters and upregulation of nAChRs, cAMP,
p-CREB and p-ERK in the tumor cells while treatment of
the mice with GABA inhibited all of these responses. In
analogy to these findings, it was also shown that cell lines
from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas were stimulated
in their growth via NNK or isoproterenol-induced β-AR
signaling [23] and that the beta-blocker propranol inhibited
the development of NNK-induced pancreatic cancer in
hamsters [24] while inducing apoptosis in pancreatic
cancer cells in vitro [25]. Moreover, nicotine induced
significant progression of pancreatic cancer xenograft
growth that was associated with a significant systemic
increase in stress neurotransmitters and upregulation of
cAMP p-CREB and p-ERK in xenograft tissues. In turn,
GABA blocked xenograft growth and the associated
upregulation of cAMP-dependent signaling in response
to nicotine [26]. Cell lines from human gastric and colon
cancers also produced noradrenaline in response to nicotine
treatment and the resulting increase in cell proliferation
and angiogenesis was inhibited by propranolol [27-29].
It hence appears that the most common human cancers
are not only stimulated by stress neurotransmitters in the
systemic circulation but additionally produce their own
noradrenaline and adrenaline.
Emerging research additionally suggests an
important stimulating role of psychological stress in the
progression, angiogenesis and metastasis of numerous
cancers. It has thus been shown that social stress in mice
increased the metastasis of breast cancer xenografts
[30] and that stress induced by passive restraint as well
as treatment with epinephrine had similar effects on
ovarian cancer [31] while social isolation stress of mice
significantly increased angiogenesis and metastasis of
colon cancer xenografts [32, 33] . Interestingly, treatment
with propranolol significantly reduced these effects.
Moreover, recent studies with lung adenocarcinoma
xenografts have shown a significant stimulation of tumor
progression in mice exposed to social stress, an effect
associated with upregulation of nAChR subunits alpha7
and alpha4 and accompanied by systemic increase in stress
neurotransmitters, reduction of GABA and activation of
the cAMP/P-CREB/ERK pathway in tumor tissues [34].
Mechanisms such as this may contribute to the ethnic
and racial differences in the smoking-related risk of lung
cancer [35] while additionally providing a mechanistic
explanation for reports that psychological stress is a
significant predictor of lung cancer mortality [36] and
that lung cancer patients with a high rate of psychological
distress at the time of diagnosis also have a history of
pre-existing psychological stress [37]. In addition, the
anxiety of patients diagnosed with cancer represents an
additional form of stress that may counteract the efficacy
of cancer therapy. It has thus been shown in mouse models
of post-operative metastasis that propranolol and a COX2 inhibitor given before and after surgical removal of
primary melanoma cell or Lewis lung carcinoma cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

foot pad implants had significantly fewer post-operative
metastases than controls [38].
In summary, beta-blockers that have been safely used
as cardio-vascular therapeutics for decades, and GABA
that has been a safe nutritional supplement for many
years, significantly reduce the proliferation, progression,
angiogenesis and metastasis of the most common human
malignancies, including adenocarcinoma of the breast,
lung, pancreas, prostate, colon and stomach as well as
ovarian cancer [39]. These agents should therefore be
rapidly moved into clinical applications to increase the
efficacy of currently available cancer therapeutics and
cancer surgery. In addition, nutritional supplementation
with GABA should be explored for the prevention of
cancer in individuals at risk (e.g. current and former
smokers).
