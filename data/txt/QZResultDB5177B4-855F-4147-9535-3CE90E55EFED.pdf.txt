ABSTRACT:
Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly malignant brain tumor of adults and children, diffusely
invades within the non-neoplastic brain. Despite aggressive current therapeutic
interventions, improved therapeutic strategies are greatly needed. Interactions
between the tumor and constituents of its microenvironment are known to regulate
malignancy, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are important as they bind
diverse extracellular proteins, including growth factors and cell adhesion molecules,
regulating the activity of several ligand-mediated signaling pathways. Recent work
from our group described a mechanism by which GBM regulates PDGFR-alpha
signaling via enzymatic alteration of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in
the extracellular microenvironment. Blocking tumor-induced alterations of HSPGs,
which can be achieved by pharmacological strategies, would potentially inhibit
multiple oncogenic signaling pathways in tumor cells and disrupt critical tumormicroenvironment interactions. Here we examine HSPGs and the enzymes that
modify them in GBM. We compare their expression across tumor subtypes, their
potential roles in oncogenesis, and their potential as novel therapeutic targets in GBM.

INTRODUCTION

different tumor subtypes. This knowledge will propel the
development of novel therapeutic strategies and advance
our ability to target tumors and to predict response.
Aberrant activation of multiple receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) signaling pathways is a unifying feature
across GBM, promoting many aspects of tumorigenesis
including tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion,
and induction of angiogenesis. Indeed the most common
alterations in GBM include amplification of RTK
receptors, such as EGFR and PDGFRA, and increased
expression of ligands, such as PDGFB [5, 10-12].
Furthermore, overexpression of ligands such as PDGFB
can drive tumorigenesis in murine brain tumor models
[13-15]. Despite the role of RTKs in driving oncogenesis,
small molecule inhibitors targeting single RTK pathways
have been largely unsuccessful in improving overall
survival [16]. A potential explanation for the limited
efficacy of these targeted therapeutics is that GBM is
driven by the summation of multiple signaling inputs
[1, 17-19]. Simultaneous targeting of multiple abnormal
signaling pathways will likely be required for the
development of more effective therapies.

Primary malignant brain tumors make up one of
the deadliest forms of cancer in both adults and children.
Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary
malignant brain tumor in adults, is a highly malignant
diffuse astrocytoma that can present de novo or develop
from the progression of a lower grade tumor. Children also
present with GBM, although less commonly. For any age
group, GBM share a similar histopathologic appearance
between tumors, however GBM are highly heterogeneous
with respect to their biologic and molecular characteristics.
Using a combination of gene expression, genomic and
proteomic data to identify patterns between GBMs,
tumors can be stratified into potentially clinically relevant
subtypes [1-8]. Future stratification of patients into
subgroups based upon predicted responsiveness to specific
therapies will likely lead to improved therapy. Despite
these exciting advances, the current prognosis for patients
with GBM is poor and median survival remains less than
two years [9]. There is great need for improvement in our
understanding of factors driving tumorigenesis within

During normal development and tissue maintenance
ligand-mediated signaling is exquisitely regulated,
including the bioavailability of ligand in the extracellular
environment. A prototypical example is the extracellular
regulation of the Wnt family of secreted proteins.
Once released from the cell Wnt ligands bind and
are sequestered by proteins such as heparan sulfate
proteoglycans (HSPGs) in the extracellular environment.
Only after ligands are released from HSPGs can they bind
to and activate their Frizzled receptors [20, 21]. While the
mechanisms regulating ligand availability in the tumor
microenvironment are just beginning to be elucidated
in GBM, they likely play a role in driving oncogenic
signaling pathways. Blocking these mechanisms has the
potential to inhibit ligand-mediated activation of multiple
oncogenic pathways in tumors.

also act as a co-receptor and promote receptor signaling,
such as with FGF2 and VEGF [20, 29, 30]. HSPGmediated signaling is also critical for normal brain
development [31].
In GBM, the expression levels of multiple HSPG
core proteins and HSPG-modifying enzymes are
significantly altered relative to normal brain (Figure 2).
HSPGs consist of a protein core and heparan sulfate
(HS) chains consisting of linear carbohydrate chains of
repeating disaccharide units. Essential for their function
in cell signaling, the HS chains undergo extensive posttranslational modifications, including sulfation on the 6-Oposition of glucosamine [32]. Indeed, 6-O-sulfation of HS
is a critical determinant of growth factor binding and is
essential for normal development [33-37]. While a number
of intracellular enzymes regulate HSPG biosynthesis and
sulfation, the recently discovered extracellular sulfatases,
SULF1 and SULF2, reveal a novel mechanism for the
regulation of HSPG-dependent signaling. By removing
6-O-sulfates on HS chains and mobilizing protein ligands
from HSPG sequestration in the extracellular environment,
the Sulfs can activate multiple key signaling pathways
(e.g., Wnt, Shh, GDNF, and PDGF) [20, 29, 38-40].
Consistent with this ability, SULF transcripts are
overexpressed in GBM and in many human cancers,
including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, head and neck
cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, multiple myeloma,
and gastric carcinoma [40-42]. In GBM, we have found
that SULF2 protein is expressed in adult and pediatric
tumors (Figure 3) and, using knockdown and transgenic

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans and extracellular
sulfatases in GBM.
HSPGs present on the cell surface as well as in
the extracellular matrix, are a major component of the
extracellular environment in normal brain and GBM [22,
23]. They regulate cellular signaling via their ability to
bind diverse protein ligands including growth factors,
chemokines, morphogens, matrix proteins, cell adhesion
molecules, and proteases [24-28]. As illustrated in Figure
1A, HSPGs can bind and sequester ligands thereby
preventing engagement with their cognate receptor, as
discussed above with the Wnts for example. HSPG can

extracellular environment. (A) Dependent on the HSPG core protein, HSPGs are found at the cell surface, in the extracellular matrix,
or in secretory vesicles. HSPG function is critical for normal growth and development and includes regulation of ligand-mediated signaling,
cell adhesion, and formation of the extracellular matrix for cell migration. (B) Model for SULF2 regulated RTK signaling in glioblastoma.
SULF2 acts on HSPGs, present in the tumor microenvironment, to decrease 6O-sulfation, release sequestered ligands such as PDGF and
increase activation of the RTK PDGFR-alpha and downstream signaling pathways in tumor cells. RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.

approaches, we have demonstrated ablation of SULF2
results in decreased activity of several RTKs, including
PDGFR-alpha, decreased tumor cell proliferation,
and prolonged survival in vivo[40]. Interestingly,
SULF2 has also been directly implicated as a driver of
carcinogenesis in NSCLC [43], pancreatic cancer [44],
hepatocellular carcinoma [45], and a murine model for
oligodendroglioma [46], further supporting its importance.
The SULFs appear to regulate multiple signaling pathways
important in cancer, likely upstream to the interaction
of growth factors with RTKs and the activation of
intracellular kinases (Figure 4). Defining the extent
and timing of SULF2 function in tumorigenesis will be
important.
HSPGs are also the targets of heparanase (HPSE),
an endoglycosidase, which generates biologically active
fragments of HS chains. Heparanase is upregulated
in many cancers, including GBM (Figure 2 and [4749]). Increased expression of heparanase in tumors
has been implicated in increased tumorigenesis, tumor
angiogenesis, and invasiveness [47-49]. Together these
studies suggest that tumors actively enzymatically modify
components of the brain tumor microenvironment to help
drive oncogenic signaling and invasion. Disruption of this
partnership may be an important therapeutic strategy.
In addition to enzymatic alterations in HSPGs, the
identity and levels of the HSPG core proteins are also
important determinants of cell signaling. The core protein
specifies proteoglycan localization and can influence both
extracellular and intracellular signaling. For example,
the syndecans (SDCs), composed of four members, are

membrane bound HSPGs and contain a cytoplasmic
domain that binds cytoskeletal proteins and can serve as a
substrate in cell signaling [50, 51]. SDCs play important
roles in cell signaling, cell adhesion, and migration.
Manipulation of syndecan-1 expression has been shown
to alter HGF-Met signaling [52, 53] and Wnt signaling
[54] in cancer. In contrast, the glypicans (GPCs) composed
of six members, are GPI-linked to the cell membrane,
and these are typically involved in growth factor and
morphogen responses. Other HSPGs, such as perlecan
(HSPG2) are found within the extracellular matrix. For
those HSPGs associated with the cell membrane, the
extracellular domain can also be shed, resulting in the
release of biologically active proteoglycans. Indeed, shed
syndecan-1 has been shown to mediate removal of CXC
chemokines and facilitate resolution of inflammation
[55]. In multiple myeloma high levels of shed syndecan-1
correlate with poor prognosis and have been associated
with increased tumor growth in animal models [56, 57].
In GBM, both total and specific HSPGs core proteins
are altered (Figure 2), including increased levels of
syndecan-1 and glypican-1 as previously demonstrated
[23, 58].
Interestingly, alterations in HSPGs vary across tumor
subtypes suggesting there may be subtype-specific HSPG
functions in GBM, Figure 4. The proneural GBM subtype,
characterized by alterations in PDGFR signaling, has high
SULF2 expression [4]. In contrast, the mesenchymal GBM
subtype exhibits increased expression of multiple other
HSPG-related genes. This latter subtype has increased
expression of genes involved in interactions with the

extracellular environment, cell signaling, and the immune
response, and, consistent with gene expression data, the
number of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages is
significantly greater in the mesenchymal compared to the
proneural subtype (Mann-Whitney, p=0.042; J. Engler
and J. Phillips, unpublished observation). While the
mechanisms driving the increased inflammatory response
in the mesenchymal subtype are not fully elucidated,
proteoglycans have the potential to influence the immune
response in cancer [59]. Indeed, tumor-derived versican
has been shown to activate macrophages and increase
metastatic tumor growth in a model for lung carcinoma

[60]. Furthermore, targeting of HSPGs with a heparan
sulfate (HS) mimetic normalized myeloid-derived
suppressor cell levels in a murine mammary carcinoma
model [61]. Understanding the function of HSPGs and the
enzymes that modify them in a subtype-specific context
will be important for the optimization of future therapeutic
strategies. This has recently been illustrated by the report
of an immunogenic therapy in which patients with a GBM
of the mesenchymal subtype had a more robust immune
response than patients with a tumor of the proneural
subtype [62].

potential therapeutic targets in GBM.

efforts will be aimed at identifying the relevant tumormicroenvironment interactions that help drive GBM and
how to effectively target them therapeutically.

Accumulating data suggest the extracellular
HSPGs, and the enzymes that modify them, may regulate
ligand-mediated signaling pathways in GBM. Given
their role in disease combined with their accessibility in
the extracellular environment, they represent clinically
relevant, druggable therapeutic targets. In malignant
astrocytoma, we recently determined that knockdown of
SULF2 resulted in decreased activity of multiple RTK
signaling pathways including PDGFR-alpha, IGF1R-beta
and EPHA2 [40], three pathways known to be involved
in astrocytoma growth and invasion [10, 13, 14, 63-65].
Furthermore, ablation of SULF2, in a relevant murine
model for astrocytoma, resulted in decreased activation
of PDGFR-alpha, decreased tumor cell proliferation,
and prolonged survival [40]. These data, combined with
the high expression of SULF2 in a significant number
of human GBMs, suggest SULF2 may be considered an
upstream therapeutic target in the treatment of GBM and
other cancers in which it is overexpressed.
Since HSPGs regulate multiple upstream signaling
pathways, and some of these same pathways are critical
in malignancy, it is of great interest that a recent class of
compounds has been developed to inhibit some of these
oncogenic functions. Heparan sulfate mimetics are highly
sulfated oligosaccharides that inhibit heparanase, sequester
HSPG-binding factors, and inhibit SULF2 [66-68]. In
preclinical studies, HS mimetics have effectively targeted
multiple HSPG-dependent phenotypes and have resulted
in decreased in vivo tumor growth, tumor invasion, tumor
metastasis, and angiogenesis [61, 69]. Furthermore, a
human Phase II clinical trial demonstrated safety and
preliminary efficacy for a HS mimetic in recurrent
hepatocellular carcinoma [70], and a recent preclinical
study of a new rationally engineered HS mimetic, M402,
suggests additional potential as a therapeutic agent [61].
While HS mimetics have not yet been tested in GBM, they
are known to inhibit SULF2 activity [67] and represent a
promising strategy.
Currently the prognosis for patients with GBM is
challenging. With recent advances in imaging, genomic
sequencing and proteomics, there is great hope that we
are entering into a new era for detection and treatment
of GBM. Stratification of patients into therapeutically
relevant subgroups will likely be an essential component
for treatment. Large-scale analyses of bulk tumors
have revealed significant differences in expression of
genes involved in tumor-microenvironment interactions
between tumor subgroups, including proteoglycans and
immune response-related gene. Targeting HSPGs and
related components of the tumor microenvironment
has the potential to simultaneously inhibit multiple
oncogenic signaling pathways in tumor cells and to disrupt
critical tumor-microenvironment interactions. Future
