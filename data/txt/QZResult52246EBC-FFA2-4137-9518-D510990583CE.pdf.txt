Abstract
Several studies link disease progression, recurrence, and treatment failures to the cancer stem-like cell
(CSC) subpopulation within the heterogeneous tumor cell population. Myc is a transcription factor having a
central function in stem cell biology and in human cancers. Hence, Myc represents an attractive target to
develop CSC-speciﬁc therapies. Recent ﬁndings suggest that Myc transcription can be silenced using an RNA
interference (RNAi)–based strategy that targets noncoding promoter-associated RNA (paRNA) overlapping
the transcription start site. In this study, we investigated the effects of silencing Myc transcription on prostate
CSC in cell culture and xenograft models of human prostate cancer. Treatment with an effective promotertargeting siRNA reduced the fraction of CSCs, leading to reduced self-renewal, tumor-initiating, and
metastatic capability. Combined analysis of stem-like cells and senescence markers indicated that Myc
silencing triggered a phenotypic shift and senescence in the CSC subpopulation. Notably, systemic delivery of
the promoter-targeting siRNA in the xenograft model produced a striking suppression in the development of
prostate tumors. Our results support a pivotal role for Myc in CSC maintenance and show that Myc targeting
via RNAi-based transcriptional silencing can trigger CSC senescence and loss of their tumor-initiating
capability. More generally, our ﬁndings demonstrate the efﬁcacy of RNAi-based transcriptional strategies
and the potential to target regulatory noncoding paRNAs for therapeutic applications. Cancer Res; 73(22);

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common epithelial cancer and
the third leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the
western countries (1, 2). Considerable progress has been
made in the last decade to understand the disease at the
molecular and genetic level (3, 4). However, there has been
limited improvement in the treatment of advanced, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; ref. 5). There is
increasing evidence that most human cancers, including
prostate cancer, are driven by a rare population of cancer
cells that display stem cell–like properties, deﬁned as cancer
stem-like cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells (6). CSCs
within primary tumors are likely the main cause of metastasis and disease recurrence (6, 7). CSCs contribute also to
treatment failures by virtue of their intrinsic resistance to
standard treatment, including chemo- and radiotherapy

(8, 9). Indeed, the inability of the current treatments to
affect CSCs may explain their limited efﬁcacy. The development of new strategies for prostate cancer treatment must
take in consideration this biologic complexity and cellular
heterogeneity. Accordingly, agents that would effectively
target and eliminate the CSC component in human tumors
might have a considerable impact on treatment and patient
outcome (8, 10).
CSCs are characterized by an imbalance between self-renewal and differentiation potential, which leads to the enhanced
survival and expansion (6). The pathways controlling the
enhanced self-renewal capability and the reduced differentiation potential of CSCs could provide ideal targets for development of CSC-speciﬁc treatment strategies (10). Myc is a
transcription factor that is activated by multiple mitogenic
signaling pathways (11). Myc is involved in many biologic
processes, including transcription, replication, cell division,
protein synthesis, and metabolism (11). Ampliﬁcation, chromosomal translocations, and deregulated expression of Myc
are among the most common alterations occurring in human
cancers (11). Myc is upregulated in primary and metastatic
prostate cancers and has been associated with progression to
CRPC (12). Myc exerts multiple roles in tumorigenesis affecting
cell proliferation, survival, metabolic adaptation, and angiogenesis (11, 13, 14). Myc has also a central role in stem cell
biology controlling the equilibrium between self-renewal and
differentiation of hematopoietic and epithelial stem cells (11).
In normal prostate, Myc is detected mainly in basal epithelial

Myc Silencing in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells

cells, which are considered the main source of normal prostate
stem cells (12, 15). Furthermore, Myc along with other stem
cell genes, such as BMI-1 and POU5F1, is highly expressed in
prostate cancer cells having the CD44þ/CD24 phenotype,
which is considered a hallmark of cancer progenitor/stem cells
(16). Myc is overexpressed in the CSC subpopulation in other
tumor types, such as glioblastoma (17) and Myc knockdown
using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in glioma stem cells
decreases proliferation and induces cell-cycle arrest (17). Furthermore, Myc inactivation in conditional transgenic mouse
models results in tumor regression associated with proliferation arrest, differentiation, senescence, or apoptosis depending
on the cellular and genetic context (18–23). Notably, systemic
inactivation of Myc in mice affects transiently normal proliferating tissues, but the effect is well tolerated and fully reversible, suggesting that Myc inhibition could be an effective and
safe therapy for cancer (24). Together, these lines of evidence
suggest that Myc has an important role in ensuring tumor
development and maintenance of CSC component in human
tumors and could be an attractive target for development of
CSC-targeted therapies.
Like many other transcription factors, Myc is a difﬁcult
target to address directly with conventional small-molecule
drugs (25). Targeting upstream regulators of Myc expression or
downstream factors cooperating with Myc oncogenic functions is a valid and promising approach to explore (11, 26, 27).
In addition, we showed recently that Myc could be epigenetically silenced with high efﬁciency by promoter-targeting
siRNAs (28). Transcriptional silencing by promoter-targeting
siRNAs could provide an effective means to modulate gene
expression in addition to canonical posttranscriptional RNA
interference (RNAi) directed to mRNAs (29). Our approach was
based on the presence of a cis-acting noncoding promoterassociated RNA (paRNA) overlapping the Myc transcription
start site (TSS) and positively regulating transcription initiation (28). Interfering with this paRNA inhibited transcription of
Myc in a sequence- and gene-speciﬁc manner (28). The mechanism behind repression of Myc transcription by promotertargeting siRNA involved the RNAi protein Argonaute 2 and
interference with the formation of the preinitiation complex
(PIC) at the Myc TSS. This strategy resulted in profound and
prolonged repression of Myc transcription. Interestingly, a
single transfection of prostate cancer cells with the promoter-targeting siRNA induced long-lasting effects on cell proliferation and colony formation, indicative of persistent loss of
proliferative potential as a consequence of Myc silencing (28).
On the contrary, there was no effect in normal human cells (28).
This remarkable reduction of the proliferative capacity of
cancer cells led us to investigate the effects of this approach
on prostate CSCs in cell cultures and tumor xenografts. In this
study, we show that Myc silencing by promoter-targeting
siRNA impairs prostate CSC maintenance and tumorigenicity
and induces senescence in the prostate CSC subpopulation.
These results are consistent with the role of Myc in the
maintenance of CSCs in human tumors and identify induction
of cell senescence as a primary mechanism of reduced selfrenewal and loss of clonogenic, tumor-initiating, and metastatic capability in Myc-depleted prostate CSCs. These ﬁndings

also demonstrate that RNAi-based targeting of regulatory
noncoding paRNAs is an effective strategy to modulate transcription of genes involved in critical oncogenic pathways for
therapeutic applications.

Materials and Methods
Detailed methods are included in the Supplementary Data.
Cell culture and transfection procedure
Human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3 were
maintained in RPMI-1640 as described previously (30). PC3
cells constitutively expressing luciferase were a gift of Dr. M.
Cecchini (University of Bern, Berne, Switzerland). Immortalized human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and PrECs stably
expressing an ESE3-directed shRNAs were maintained as
previously described (30). Prostatosphere cultures were established as previously described (30, 31). Myc13 and control GL3
siRNAs were purchased from Ambion and transfected at the
concentration of 100 nmol/L with Lipofectamine 2000 as
described previously (28).
Tumor xenografts
Mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. Animal
experiments were approved by the Swiss Veterinary Authority
(No. 5/2011) and performed according to national and international guidelines. Mice bearing subcutaneous PC3 xenografts
were injected intraperitoneally with Myc13 and GL3 siRNA
formulated with in vivo-jetPEI (Polyplus Transfection) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a N/P ratio of 5.
RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription
PCR analysis
RNA was isolated using TRizol reagent (Invitrogen). mRNA
levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription
(qRT)-PCR as described previously (28, 32). For Myc13 siRNA
detection, total RNA was reverse-transcribed with customdesigned TaqMan Small RNA Assay (Applied Biosystems) and
U6 small RNA (RNU6b) was used as control.
DNA extraction and PCR analysis
Lung metastases after intravenous injection of cancer cells
were analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) based on ampliﬁcation of nontranscribed region in human and mouse genome
as previously described (33). Results are expressed as percentage of human cancer cells relative to the total amount of mouse
lung cells.
Gene expression data analysis
Prostate cancer gene expression datasets GSE14206 (34) and
GSE21034 (35) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA;
ref. 36) was performed using 13 predeﬁned embryonic stem
cell (ESC) gene sets derived from Ben-Porath and colleagues
(37) to assess the enrichment of ESC-like gene signatures on
the basis of Myc expression. The ESC gene sets represented
four functional groups: ES expressed genes; NANOG, POU5F1,
and SOX2 targets; MYC targets; and polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2) targets (37).

Results
Myc is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells with
stem-like and tumor-initiating properties
To establish the relevance of Myc as therapeutic target in
prostate CSCs and identify adequate experimental systems, we
examined the expression of Myc in PC3 and DU145 prostate
cancer cells cultured either in adherent condition or as ﬂoating
prostatospheres. These two cell lines are androgen receptor
(AR)–independent and represent widely used models of
CRPC. Despite the high level of Myc in monolayer cultures
of PC3 and DU145 cells, prostatosphere-forming cells exhibited signiﬁcantly higher expression of Myc compared with
adherent growing cells as indicated by qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and immunoblotting (Fig. 1A–C). Prostatosphere-forming cells had also higher expression of the stem
cell markers NANOG, KLF4, POU5F1, SOX2, and BMI-1,
consistent with enrichment of CSCs (Fig. 1D). Preferential

expression of stem cell markers compared with monolayer
adherent cultures was also reported in prostatospheres
derived from DU145 cells (30). Myc has been linked previously to activation of an ESC-like transcriptional program,
indicating that it could contribute to the stem cell–like
phenotype displayed by many human cancers (11, 38). To
establish whether Myc expression was also associated with
CSC features in clinical human prostate cancer samples, we
adopted a similar bioinformatic approach. To this end, we
used predeﬁned ESC-like gene sets (37) and performed GSEA
in two prostate cancer gene expression datasets comprising
52 and 131 primary tumors (34, 35). In both datasets, Myc
was signiﬁcantly upregulated in tumors compared with
normal prostate (Supplementary Fig. S1). In both cases,
Myc-overexpressing tumors were highly enriched of ESClike gene signatures, including targets of key ESC transcription factors POU5F1, NANOG, and SOX2 as well as Myc
target genes (Supplementary Table S1). Conversely, Mycoverexpressing tumors displayed negative regulation of
common PRC2 target genes. Thus, Myc expression was
functionally associated with a CSC phenotype and ESC-like
transcriptional features in human prostate cancer.

Myc Silencing in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells

Prostatosphere-derived cells from PC3 (Fig. 1E) and DU145
(30) cells maintained intact their ability to form prostatospheres when passed in prostatosphere-forming conditions
for multiple generations, which is indicative of their selfrenewal capability. On the other hand, when prostatosphere-forming cells were dissociated and plated in adherent
growth conditions in serum-supplemented medium, they generated monolayer cultures morphologically indistinguishable
from those derived from adherent cells, indicating that prostatosphere cells retained the ability to generate daughter cells
with a more differentiated phenotype. Notably, expression of
Myc and POU5F1 was reduced when prostatosphere-forming
cells were grown as monolayer (Fig. 1F). To further assess the
properties of prostatosphere-forming cells, we compared the
ability of prostatosphere-derived and adherent growing PC3
cells to form tumors in immunodeﬁcient mice. To this end, we
used PC3.Luc cells, which constitutively express the luciferase
reporter gene and can be monitored by in vivo bioluminescence
imaging. Prostatosphere-derived cells formed subcutaneous
tumors with higher efﬁciency than adherent growing cells,
consistent with an enrichment of the fraction of tumor-initiating cells. As low as 103 prostatosphere-derived cells were able
to form subcutaneous tumors (Fig. 1G and Supplementary Fig.
S2). On the contrary, adherent growing cells generated detectable tumors only when 105 were injected (i.e., > 100-fold
difference).
The cell surface markers CD44 and CD24 have been used to
identify cell subpopulations with different stemness capability
within established human cell lines and primary cultures of
normal and tumor-derived epithelial cells, with CD44þ/CD24

cells generally having the highest CSC capability (16, 39).
Consistently, we found that CD44þ/CD24 cells sorted by
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from monolayer
cultures of PC3 cells were able to generate tumors when
injected subcutaneously in athymic nude mice, whereas the
remaining CD44þ/CD24þ fraction did not (Supplementary Fig.
S3). Because primary prostatospheres are only partially
enriched of stem-like cells (40, 41), we characterized the CD44
and CD24 expression of the prostatosphere-forming subpopulation in PC3 cells. About 95% of prostatosphere-forming cells
were CD44þ/CD24 and 5% were CD44/CD24 (Fig. 2D),
conﬁrming the heterogeneity of prostatosphere-forming cells.
In addition, qRT-PCR conﬁrmed that CD24 mRNA was lower in
prostatospheres compared with monolayer cultures of PC3
and DU145 cells, whereas CD44 mRNA was slightly increased
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Furthermore, when isolated by FACS
from primary prostatospheres, CD44þ/CD24 PC3 cells generated secondary prostatospheres with high efﬁciency, whereas CD44/CD24 cells did not (Fig. 3A and B). Together, these
data indicate that prostatosphere-forming cells and the CD44þ
/CD24 subpopulation derived from human prostate cancer
cell lines have CSC properties and tumor-initiating capability
and provide an appropriate system to address Myc as candidate for CSC-targeted therapies.
Myc silencing affects stem-like properties of
prostatosphere-derived cells
We showed that Myc13 siRNA inhibited Myc transcription
by interfering with PIC assembly on the promoter (Fig. 2A) and
was effective in various prostate cancer cell lines independent

of their AR status (28). To assess the effect of Myc silencing
on human prostate CSCs, prostatospheres derived from PC3
and DU145 cells were dissociated, transfected with promoter-targeting (Myc13) and control (GL3) siRNA, and re-plated
in prostatosphere-forming conditions. We used cyanine 3–
tagged Myc13 (Cy3-Myc13) to ensure that siRNA uptake in
single-cell suspensions of prostatosphere-forming or FACSsorted cells was similar to that achieved in cells transfected
as adherent monolayer (Supplementary Fig. S5). Transfection of Myc13 siRNA dramatically reduced prostatosphere
formation in both cell lines (Fig. 2B). On the contrary, the
control siRNA did not affect prostatosphere-forming ability.
Notably, after treatment with Myc13 siRNA, isolated viable
ﬂoating cells were still present in the culture dishes (Fig. 2C),
indicating that Myc silencing arrested growth but did not
induce apoptosis in prostatosphere-forming cells, in agreement with the previous results with adherent growing cells
(28).
To determine whether phenotypic changes occurred in
prostatosphere-forming cells after Myc silencing, we assessed
CD44 and CD24 expression in prostatosphere cells after treatment with control and Myc13 siRNA. Control-treated prostatosphere cells contained 95% of CD44þ/CD24 cells and no
CD44þ/CD24þ cells were present (Fig. 2D). After treatment
with Myc13 siRNA, the number of CD44þ/CD24 decreased
(95% vs. 73%) and that of CD44þ/CD24þ cells increased
substantially (0% vs. 27%; Fig. 2D). Furthermore, using a
ﬂow-cytometric assay to detect senescent cells based on
senescence-associated b-galactosidase (SA-b-gal) activity and
the use of the ﬂuorescent substrate ﬂuorescein-di-b-D-galac-

6820

topyranoside (FDG; ref. 42), we found that the CD44þ/CD24þ
subpopulation induced by Myc13 siRNA was phenotypically
senescent (Fig. 2E). Essentially, 100% of FDG-positive cells
in the Myc13-treated sample were CD44þ/CD24þ, indicating
a link between Myc silencing, the CD44þ/CD24þ phenotype
and induction of cell senescence.
Myc silencing reduces prostatosphere-forming ability of
the CD44þ/CD24 cell subpopulation
To further investigate the function of Myc in prostate CSCs,
we isolated by FACS the two subpopulations present in prostatospheres derived from PC3 cells (i.e., CD44þ/CD24 and
CD44/CD24) and assessed their capacity to form secondary
prostatospheres after transfection with control and Myc13
siRNA. CD44þ/CD24 prostatosphere-derived cells transfected with control siRNA formed secondary prostatospheres
(Fig. 3A). Remarkably, silencing of Myc in CD44þ/CD24
prostatosphere-derived cells completely prevented formation
of secondary prostatospheres. CD44/CD24 cells derived
from primary prostatospheres were unable to form secondary
prostatospheres in control samples and Myc13 did not have
any effect. As shown by phase contrast microscopy, while
secondary prostatospheres formed in control CD44þ/CD24
cultures, isolated viable cells were present after treatment with
Myc13 and in CD44/CD24 cultures (Fig. 3B). FACS analysis
showed that control-transfected CD44þ/CD24 cells reproduced the original CD44 and CD24 phenotype (90% CD44þ/
CD24 and 10% CD44-/CD24-; Fig. 3C). CD44/CD24
cells failed to regenerate the original phenotype of prostatosphere-forming cells and remained prevalently CD44/CD24

Myc Silencing in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells

(80%). Remarkably, treatment of CD44þ/CD24 cells with
Myc13 siRNA reduced the CD44þ/CD24 subpopulation
(73%) and increased the fraction of CD44þ/CD24þ cells
(13%), conﬁrming the phenotypic shift seen as result of Myc
silencing in prostatosphere-derived cells. To deﬁne the mechanism causing the depletion of cells with stem-like properties
by Myc13 siRNA, cells from primary prostatospheres were
dissociated, sorted by FACS, and the CD44þ/CD24 fraction
was transfected with Myc13 siRNA. Interestingly, after 10 days,
we found that a relevant fraction of CD44þ/CD24 prostatosphere-derived cells (15%) was FDG-positive (Fig. 3D). Moreover, the majority of FDG-positive cells (80%) exhibited the
CD44þ/CD24þ phenotype (Fig. 3D). Therefore, Myc silencing
in the CD44þ/CD24 subpopulation derived from primary
prostatospheres was functionally linked to a shift toward the
CD44þ/CD24þ phenotype and cell senescence.

Myc silencing reduces the CSC component and induces
cell senescence in monolayer cultures of human prostate
cancer cells
To determine the ability of Myc transcriptional silencing to
affect the fraction of CSCs within the heterogeneous cancer cell
population of an established cell line, we transfected PC3 cells
grown as monolayer cultures with control and Myc13 siRNA.
As shown previously (28), transfection of adherent growing
prostate cancer cell lines with Myc13 siRNA efﬁciently
repressed Myc transcription (Fig. 4A). We reported previously
that this was associated with morphologic changes (i.e., cells
acquired a polygonal form and become larger and ﬂatter),
reduced proliferation, and induction of cell senescence (28).
Using the ﬂow-cytometric FDG assay we conﬁrmed that,
concomitant with Myc silencing, the percentage of senescent
cells increased substantially in Myc13-treated PC3 cells (Fig.

4B). In parallel, we found that the ability of Myc13-treated cells
to generate prostatospheres was signiﬁcantly reduced as compared with control cells (Fig. 4C). Moreover, Myc silencing
reduced the percentage of CD44þ/CD24 cells (90% vs. 78%)
and led to an increase of CD44þ/CD24þ (9% vs. 18%) cells in the
total cell population (Fig. 4D). This shift toward the CD44þ/
CD24þ phenotype is relevant as CD44þ/CD24þ cells showed
impaired tumorigenicity in mice (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Interestingly, in agreement with the data with CSC-enriched
populations, FDG-positive cells induced upon Myc silencing
in adherent PC3 cell cultures were almost exclusively CD44þ/
CD24þ (Fig. 4E). Similar results, (i.e., increased number of
CD44þ/CD24þ and concomitant FDG positivity) were
observed upon transfection of adherent growing DU145 cells
with Myc13 siRNA (Fig. 4F and G). We further validated these
ﬁndings using immortalized normal PrECs and the transformed and tumorigenic derivative ESE3kd-PrECs generated
by knocking down ESE3/EHF (30). Knockdown of this epithelial-speciﬁc transcription factor in PrECs resulted in acquisition of stem cell–like properties and tumorigenicity (30) and
was associated with increased Myc expression (Supplementary
Fig. S6). Transfection of Myc13 in ESE3kd-PrECs reduced Myc
expression and concomitantly prostatosphere-forming ability
(Fig. 4H and I). Moreover, Myc silencing was associated with
increased cell senescence (Fig. 4J). Importantly, knockdown of
Myc by Myc13 did not affect proliferation of normal PrECs
(Supplementary Fig. S7).
Targeting Myc reduces CSCs and prevents tumor
development in vivo
To determine whether Myc silencing and consequent
depletion of CSCs would inhibit tumorigenicity of prostate
cancer cells in vivo, we performed xenotransplantation
studies with in vitro–transfected PC3 cells. In these studies,
monolayer cultures of PC3 cells were transfected with control and Myc13 siRNA and, after 24 hours, equal numbers of
viable control- and Myc13-treated cells were injected subcutaneously in immunodeﬁcient mice. Growth of control
PC3 cells was not affected and was comparable with nontransfected PC3 cells (Fig. 5A). On the contrary, injection of
the same number of Myc13-treated PC3 cells resulted in
signiﬁcant delay of tumor growth. Remarkably, analysis of
Myc mRNA in tumor tissues by qRT-PCR showed lower
levels of Myc expression as compared with control tumors
still after 4 weeks from subcutaneous implantation (Fig. 5B).
Reduced tumorigenicity of Myc13-transfected cells was
conﬁrmed by using PC3.Luc cells transfected with control
and Myc13 siRNA and in vivo imaging (Fig. 5C). To assess
whether Myc silencing affected the metastatic capability of
prostate cancer cells, control- and Myc13-treated PC3 cells
were injected into tail vein of mice and lung metastases were
assessed after 4 weeks. Quantitative analysis using a previously described qPCR method (33) showed a signiﬁcant
decrease of human metastatic cells in lungs of mice receiving Myc13-treated cells compared with control cells (Fig.
5D). Histopathologic examination of lung tissue sections
conﬁrmed the presence of metastases in the control group
and none in mice injected with Myc13-treated cells (Fig. 5E).

The remarkable effect of the promoter-targeting siRNA on
tumorigenicity and metastatic capability was consistent with
inhibition of the CSC component in PC3 tumor xenografts as
result of the repression of Myc transcription. To verify this
hypothesis, tumors were explanted and single-cell suspensions
were obtained from control- and Myc13-treated xenografts and
analyzed by FACS. Notably, Myc13-treated tumor xenografts
had reduced content of CD44þ/CD24 cells (27% vs. 11%) and
concomitant increase of CD44þ/CD24þ cells (51% vs. 66%),
indicative of a reduction of CSC component analogous to the in
vitro experiments (Fig. 5F). To further assess the effects on the
CSC compartment in tumor xenografts, single cells derived
from tumors generated from in vitro–transfected PC3 cells
were re-plated in vitro in prostatosphere-forming conditions
(Fig. 5G). Notably, prostatosphere-forming capacity of Myc13treated and control xenografts was similar at the ﬁrst prostatospheres generation, likely due to transient expansion of ex
vivo–generated primary prostatospheres. However, there was a
sharp decline of secondary prostatospheres from Myc13-treated xenografts, consistent with reduced self-renewal capability.
Prostatosphere formation from the control xenografts at the
second generation was unaffected. To assess in vivo the CSC
capability of the cells derived from control- and Myc13-treated
xenografts, tumor-derived cells were reimplanted subcutaneously in athymic nude mice. Strikingly, cells derived from
control xenografts produced second-generation tumors with
100% efﬁciency (Supplementary Fig. S8A). On the contrary,
cells derived from Myc13-treated xenografts produced secondgeneration tumors with lower efﬁciency (Supplementary Fig.
S8B and S8C). In addition, second-generation tumors from
Myc13-transfected cells grew less than control tumors, indicating that the proliferative and tumor-initiating potential was
persistently impaired in Myc13-treated cells (Supplementary
Fig. S8D). Concomitant with the depletion of CSC capability,
we found that a higher fraction of FDG-positive senescent cells
in the primary Myc13-treated tumor xenografts compared with
control xenografts (81% vs. 57%; Fig. 5H). Strikingly, as seen in
the in vitro experiments, FDG-positive senescent cells derived
from Myc13 tumor xenografts were mainly CD44þ/CD24þ (Fig.
5H). Furthermore, tumor xenografts from Myc13-treated cells
exhibited increased expression of p21, a marker of growth
arrest and senescence (2% vs. 8%) along with reduced Myc
expression (50% vs. 0%; Fig. 5I). Collectively, these results
indicated that Myc silencing reduced self-renewal capability
and maintenance of prostate CSCs with a consequent decline
of the CSC subpopulation and of the tumorigenic and metastatic potential in vivo.
Systemic delivery of Myc promoter-targeting siRNA
inhibits tumor development in mice
Both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed consistent and
long-term effects on proliferative and tumorigenic potential of
prostate cancer cells as result of transcriptional silencing of
Myc. We next investigated whether systemic delivery of Myc13
siRNA could affect Myc expression and tumor growth in mouse
xenografts. Systemic administration of siRNAs is challenging
due to their poor stability and biodistribution (43, 44). For
delivery of Myc13 siRNA, we used in vivo-jetPEI, a cationic

polymer preparation successfully used in previous studies (45).
In cell culture experiments, this reagent was as effective as
Lipofectamine in transfecting siRNA and inducing Myc silencing (80% gene knockdown). To accurately assess the delivery
of Myc13 siRNA in tumor xenogratfs, we used a qRT-PCR
method with Myc13-speciﬁc primers and U6 small RNA as
control. Previous tests showed the speciﬁcity and accuracy of
this assay to quantify the amount of Myc13 siRNA taken up by
cells in cell culture experiments (data not shown). Furthermore, the amount detected by the qRT-PCR assay reﬂected
intact Myc13 siRNA accumulated within cells or tissues. To
determine dose and time dependence of siRNA uptake, mice
received a single intraperitoneal injection of increasing doses
of siRNA (0.5, 2, and 5 mg/kg) and were sacriﬁced after 2 days.
Myc13 siRNA uptake increased with the dose, although the
difference between 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg was minimal, probably
reﬂecting saturation of the uptake in the tissue (Fig. 6A).
Furthermore, in mice receiving a single injection of 2 mg/kg,
the amount of siRNA in tumors was similar after 1 and 3 days
from the injection and then declined at 7 days (Fig. 6B). In
parallel, we measured in these same samples the level of
human Myc mRNA and human b-2-microglobulin as reference
gene. After 2 days from a single injection of 2 and 5 mg/kg of

Myc13 siRNA, Myc mRNA was reduced by about 40%, whereas
no effect was seen at 0.5 mg/kg (Fig. 6C). The effect on Myc
mRNA level after a single injection of 2 mg/kg of siRNA
was similar at 1 and 3 days, whereas the effect was lost after
7 days, in line with the kinetics of siRNA uptake (Fig. 6D).
Therefore, detectable and biologically active amounts of
Myc13 siRNA were delivered by intraperitoneal injection at
doses 2.0 mg/kg. Remarkably, an effect on Myc mRNA was
seen after a single administration of siRNA and the effect
persisted for up to 3 days.
On the basis of the kinetics of siRNA uptake and pharmacodynamic data, mice with subcutaneous tumor xenografts
were treated with repeated intraperitoneal injections twice a
week. There were no signs of toxicity (i.e., loss of body
weight, behavioral changes, etc.) associated with repeated
administration of control and Myc13 siRNA. For accurate
measurement of tumor size, groups of control and Myc13
siRNA–treated mice were sacriﬁced to determine tumor
weight. The effect on tumor growth was evident after the last
cycle of treatment, when tumors in the control group expanded
and those in Myc13-treated group were almost completely
arrested (P < 0.005; Fig. 6E). At this time, immunohistochemistry showed a clear reduction of Myc protein and of the

Discussion
In this study, we show that RNAi-based transcriptional
silencing of Myc is an effective strategy to block maintenance
and propagation of prostate CSCs in cell cultures and tumor
xenografts. Myc silencing was associated with the induction of
phenotypic changes and senescence in the prostate CSC
subpopulation, leading to reduced self-renewal and tumorinitiating capability. In vivo, Myc silencing resulted in remarkable suppression of subcutaneous tumors and lung metastasis,
consistent with the impairment of essential tumor-initiating
functions and depletion of CSCs. This study also demonstrates
the efﬁcacy of the RNAi-based strategy for targeting regulatory
noncoding paRNAs and modulating transcription of genes
involved in critical oncogenic pathways.
Current evidence suggests that tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis in human cancers are supported by a
speciﬁc subpopulation of cancer cells with stem cell–like
properties (9). CSCs are operationally deﬁned as cells that
have high tumor-initiating capability in vivo, are capable of
self-renewal, and have partial differentiation potential (6).
Human prostate CSCs with these characteristics have been
described by various groups using speciﬁc cell surface
markers and a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays
(8, 16, 41). Experimental systems that allow to reproducibly
isolate, quantify, and functionally characterize cells with
stem-like features are essential to investigate the pathways
involved in self-renewal and identify CSC-speciﬁc therapeutic targets (6, 16, 41). In this study, we show that prostatosphere-forming cells derived from prostate cancer cell lines
had high self-renewal capability, maintained their characteristics through multiple passages in stem cell selective
conditions and, nevertheless, retained the capacity to reconstitute the heterogeneity of the original cell population when
re-plated in serum-supplemented medium. Prostatospheres
derived from PC3 and DU145 cell cultures expressed high
levels of Myc and other genes important for preserving stem
cell functions (Fig. 1). Furthermore, prostatospheres were
highly enriched of CD44þ/CD24 cells, a hallmark of progenitor/stem cells in many epithelial tissues (16). Consistently, CD44þ/CD24 cells isolated from prostatospheres
had the ability to form secondary prostatospheres in vitro
and to reproduce the original phenotypic heterogeneity.
Moreover, prostatosphere-forming cells and the CD44þ/
CD24 cell subpopulation derived from human prostate
cancer cell lines were able to form tumors in mice with
higher efﬁciency than the bulk cancer cell population, indicating that they behaved as bona ﬁde CSCs and tumorinitiating cells.
Myc is overexpressed at early and late stages of development
of many human cancers, including prostate cancer (11, 12, 15).
Among its many functions, Myc has an important role in
normal and neoplastic stem cells (11). Consistently, we found
that Myc overexpression was associated with enrichment of
ESC-like gene signatures in human prostate cancers (Supplementary Table S1). Myc is also implicated in the inhibition of

oncogene-induced senescence (46). Myc inactivation in Mycdriven transgenic mouse models induces tumor regression and
senescence, although the genetic and epigenetic context can
inﬂuence type and reversibility of the response (22, 46). We
described previously that transcriptional silencing of Myc
reduced proliferation and clonogenic capacity of prostate
cancer cells with high Myc expression, whereas growth of
nontransformed human cells was not affected (28). In the
present study, we investigated the consequences of Myc
silencing on the CSC subpopulation. We used prostatosphere-forming cells and the CD44þ/CD24 subpopulation
derived from human prostate cancer cell lines as model
systems to analyze the effects of Myc silencing on the CSC
component in human prostate tumors. Transfection of Myc13
siRNA in prostatosphere cells led to almost complete suppression of in vitro prostatosphere-forming and self-renewal capacity (Fig. 2). Interestingly, many cells in Myc13-treated samples
were still viable in prostatosphere-forming conditions, whereas the fraction of CD44þ/CD24 cells was reduced with
concomitant appearance of double-positive CD44þ/CD24þ
cells (Fig. 2). A relevant portion of cells treated with Myc13
siRNA was senescent and double-positive for CD44 and CD24
(Fig. 2). Notably, after continuous growth in prostatosphereforming conditions, Myc13-treated cells did not reacquire
prostatosphere-forming ability, indicating that they had irreversibly lost their stem-like properties. Similarly, Myc silencing
in CD44þ/CD24 cells blocked formation of secondary prostatospheres, reduced the fraction of cells having the CD44þ/
CD24 phenotype, and increased the fraction of CD44þ/
CD24þ and senescent cells (Fig. 3). Interestingly, this was
observed also in prostate cancer cell lines and transformed
PrECs cultured in adherent conditions (Fig. 4), underlying the
ability of this approach to affect the CSC compartment within
the heterogeneous bulk cancer cell population.
We showed previously that RNAi-based transcriptional
silencing produced a prolonged suppression of Myc expression
and function in vitro even after a single administration, resulting in persistent effects on the proliferative and clonogenic
capacity of prostate cancer cells (28). To investigate the
possibility to impair tumor growth and metastasis in vivo with
promoter-targeting siRNA, in vitro–transfected prostate cancer cells were implanted subcutaneously or injected intravenously in mice. Myc silencing had profound effect on both
subcutaneous tumors and lung metastasis (Fig. 5). Notably,
tumors derived from xenografts generated by Myc13-treated
cells had a reduced fraction of CD44þ/CD24 cells and
increased content of CD44þ/CD24þ cells. Consistent with a
depletion of CSCs, cells from Myc13-treated xenografts had
reduced ability to propagate ex vivo in prostatosphere-forming
conditions and to form secondary tumors when re-implanted
in mice. Strikingly, cells derived from Myc13-treated xenografts
had also a higher percentage of senescent cells compared with
control-treated xenografts and these cells were mainly CD44þ
/CD24þ, consistent with a phenotypic switch and increased
senescence. Furthermore, we found that systemic administration of Myc13 siRNA reduced Myc expression and led to
profound inhibition of the development of prostate tumor
xenografts (Fig. 6). Thus, depletion of CSC in response to Myc

silencing was associated with activation of a latent senescence
program and reduced tumorigenic and metastatic potential.
These ﬁndings are in agreement with the hypothesis that,
although perhaps less able to induce tumor regression, CSCtargeted therapies could be particularly advantageous in the
adjuvant setting or in combination with drugs directed to the
bulk tumor cell population to reduce disease recurrence and
metastasis (10). Moreover, our data suggest that this Myctargeting strategy might be equally effective in AR-dependent
and -independent prostate cancers and as well in other tumor
types with high Myc expression. Indeed, Myc expression, alone
or in combination with other CSC markers, could serve to
identify patients that might beneﬁt speciﬁcally from this
approach. Although many concerns still remain of the clinical
applicability of RNAi-based therapeutics (43, 44), the feasibility
of this approach has been demonstrated preclinically in mice
and non-human primates and, more recently, in human clinical trials (47–50). Notably, the doses used in these preclinical
and clinical trials are similar to those tested here for systemic
administration of Myc13 siRNA to mice. Collectively, our
ﬁndings therefore provide evidence of the efﬁcacy of this
approach to silence genes, like Myc, essential for prostate CSC
maintenance and of the feasibility of delivering effective doses
of Myc promoter-targeting siRNA to impair CSC functions and
tumor development in vivo.
