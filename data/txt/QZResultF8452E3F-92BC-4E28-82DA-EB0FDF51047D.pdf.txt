Abstract
Bag3, a nucleotide exchange factor of the heat shock protein Hsp70, has been implicated in cell signaling. Here,
we report that Bag3 interacts with the SH3 domain of Src, thereby mediating the effects of Hsp70 on Src signaling.
Using several complementary approaches, we established that the Hsp70–Bag3 module is a broad-acting
regulator of cancer cell signaling by modulating the activity of the transcription factors NF-kB, FoxM1, Hif1a,
the translation regulator HuR, and the cell-cycle regulators p21 and survivin. We also identiﬁed a small-molecule
inhibitor, YM-1, that disrupts the Hsp70–Bag3 interaction. YM-1 mirrored the effects of Hsp70 depletion on these
signaling pathways, and in vivo administration of this drug was sufﬁcient to suppress tumor growth in mice.
Overall, our results deﬁned Bag3 as a critical factor in Hsp70-modulated signaling and offered a preclinical proofof-concept that the Hsp70–Bag3 complex may offer an appealing anticancer target. Cancer Res; 74(17); 4731–40.

Introduction
The major heat shock protein Hsp70 (HspA1A) has also been
implicated in cancer. Hsp70 is a stress-inducible molecular
chaperone that participates in protection of the proteome from
aggregation and promotes refolding and degradation of damaged polypeptides (1, 2). The levels of this protein are highly
elevated in a variety of cancers, and correlate with tumor grade,
metastasis, chemotherapy resistance, and subsequently, poor
prognosis, suggesting that Hsp70 plays a speciﬁc role in cancer
(3, 4). Importantly, although Hsp70 is critical for survival of
cancer cells, it is dispensable for viability of nontransformed cells

(5). Accordingly, Hsp70 knockout mice are healthy (6), and the
inactivation of Hsp70 manifests serious problems only following
a challenge with stress (6, 7), or acute inﬂammation (8).
To leverage these observations into therapeutics, several
groups have explored the mechanisms by which cancer cells
become addicted to Hsp70. On their path to tumorigenesis, cells
must escape apoptosis (9), anoikis (10), and the harsh conditions
of the tumor microenvironment (11). Although elevated levels of
Hsp70 have strong antiapoptotic activity (12, 13), it is not yet
clear whether this function is important for its role in cancer.
Unlike apoptosis, the ﬁnding that Hsp70 suppresses cellular
senescence has established a clear connection to cancer.
Senescence is deﬁned as irreversible cell growth arrest that
is associated with assorted cellular changes in morphology and
gene expression (14, 15). Certain oncogenes may trigger senescence, oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), which provides
defense against cancer. We have demonstrated that depletion
of Hsp70 activates senescence in cells transformed by the
oncogenes Her2, PIK3CA, and RAS, but that it has minimal
effects in normal cells (16, 17). Accordingly, Hsp70 knockout
mice did not develop breast cancer upon expression of Her2
oncogene (5). Therefore, Hsp70 could be critical for the escape
of transformed cells from OIS, a property that deﬁnes its role in
tumor initiation.
These properties of Hsp70 suggest that it could be used as a
drug target. There have been several attempts to develop
inhibitors of Hsp70 for cancer treatment, including inhibitors
of substrate binding, for example, aptamers (18) or piﬁthrin m
(19–22), or compounds that interact with the ATPase domain,
such as VER155008 (23), MAL3-101 (24), and YK-5 (25). However, development of these inhibitors has not reached the
clinical trial stage.

To tailor inhibitor development to cancer, speciﬁc mechanisms underlying the effects of Hsp70 on tumor development
should be deﬁned. In search for these mechanisms, we focused
on a nucleotide exchange factor Bag3. This protein contains
the Bag domain that binds to a motif in the ATPase domain of
Hsp70 proteins (26), as well as PxxP and WW domains (26),
which may connect it to SH3 domains and PPxY motifs of
signaling proteins (27, 28). Bag3 has been implicated in macroautophagy and aggresome formation (29–31). In both processes, Bag3 was proposed to link complexes of Hsp70 with protein
aggregates to the autophagic and aggresome machineries.
Although it is unknown how Bag3 interacts with the latter, in
the process of autophagy, Bag3 uses its WW domain to interact
with one of the organizers of the autophagic vacuole SYNPO2
(30). In addition to its function in recruitment of the Hsp70bound cargo, it was demonstrated that Bag3 can interact with
signaling factors via its PxxP motif (e.g., with PLCg; ref. 32) or
WW domain (e.g., with components of the Hippo pathway
LATS1 and AMOT1; ref. 30). Because Bag3 has been implicated
in cancer cell motility and invasion (33–35), there is a possibility that these effects result from regulation of signaling
pathways by Bag3. Interestingly, in the previous studies, the
effects of Bag3 on signaling were not connected to effects of
Hsp70 on these pathways. Here, we hypothesized that Bag3
could serve as a scaffold with the potential for integrating
Hsp70 levels and multiple cancer signaling pathways, and thus
mediate effects of Hsp70 on cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures
MCF10A, HEK293, MCF7, HCT116, B16-F10, and HeLa
were from ATCC and initially frozen for storage upon
receipt. ATCC authenticates its cell lines using short tandem repeat analysis. Cells were resuscitated and passaged
for less than 6 months during use in experiments. MCF10A
cells expressing PIK3CA or Her2 were as described before
(5, 16, 17). MCF10A cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM)-F12 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, hydrocortisone (500 ng/mL),
insulin (10 mg/mL), cholera toxin (100 ng/mL), and epidermal growth factor (20 ng/mL). HEK293T cells were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). B16-F10, MCF7, and HeLa
cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS. HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy 5A medium
with 10% FBS. All cultures contained 1% penicillin/
streptomycin.
Mice and xenografts
For xenografts, 500,000 MCF7 cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio
with Matrigel, and 1 million cells were injected subcutaneously
in 6-week-old female NCR nude mice (Taconic). For the B16F10 melanoma allografts, 200,000 cells were injected subcutaneously in hind legs of 6-week-old C57BL6 female mice. Tumor
growth was monitored every other day using caliper and
calculated according to the formula L  W2  p/6, where L
is length and W is width.

Results
Bag3 mediates effects of Hsp70 on Src activity
To uncover the role of Bag3 and its association with Hsp70 in
cancer, we sought to identify SH3 domain-containing signaling
factors that can interact with the PxxP motif of Bag3. Accordingly, we performed pull-down experiments using a series
of recombinant SH3 domains of various proteins fused to GST.
GST-CD40 lacking the SH3 domain was used as a negative
control. Lysates with in vitro–translated S35-labeled Bag3
were passed over beads carrying various SH3–GST fusion
proteins, and bound Bag3 was detected. In the pull-down
experiment, Bag3 interacted with SH3 domains of PLCg, Src,
c-Abl, c-Grap, Nck, Crk, RasGAP, n-Grab2, and c-Grab2
(Fig. 1A). These proteins are components of cancer-related
pathways, highlighting the potential of Bag3 as a master
regulator of cancer signaling. Although any of these signaling
proteins may contribute to cancer development, to explore
mechanistically how Bag3 regulates signaling, we chose Src as a
model.
First, we conﬁrmed that the full-length Src protein interacts
with Bag3 in cells. FLAG-labeled Bag3 was coexpressed with
Src in 293T cells, precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and Src
was probed on the blot with anti-Src antibody. Figure 1B, left
shows that Src is effectively associated with Bag3. A similar
experiment was carried out in HeLa cells to detect association
of Bag3 with endogenous Src (Fig. 1B, right).
Because Bag3 is a cofactor of Hsp70, we further assessed how
the ability to interact with Hsp70 inﬂuences association of
Bag3 with the SH3 domain of Src. Various constructs of Bag3
were expressed, cell lysates were incubated with beads carrying
recombinant SH3 domain of Src, and bound Bag3 molecules
were detected by immunoblotting. Besides a full-length Bag3
construct, we tested deletions of the PxxP and Bag domains
(referred to as FL, DPxxP, and DB, respectively), as well as an
R480A mutation, which impairs Bag3 binding to Hsp70 (Fig. 1C;
ref. 36). The inability of the DB and R480A constructs to bind to
Hsp70 was conﬁrmed in the pull-down experiment (Fig. 1D).
The full-length Bag3 effectively interacted with the SH3
domain of Src, and binding was strongly reduced by deletion
of the PxxP domain, as expected (Fig. 1E). Importantly, both DB

coimmunoprecipitation of Bag3 with full-length Src in 293T cells. Relatively low abundance of Src in this cell line necessitated overexpression of Src for
immunoprecipitation as well as FLAG-tagged Bag3. Cells were collected and lysed 24 hours after transfection. Negative controls included GFP only
(control) or Src only (-FL-Bag3). Middle, FL-Bag3 had expression of both FLAG-tagged Bag3 and Src. Immunoprecipitation was done using FLAG antibody
and blot was processed with TrueBlot secondary antibody. Right, coimmunoprecipitation of full-length Src with FLAG-tagged Bag3 in HeLa cells. Cells

of Bag3 constructs with SH3 domain of Src. HeLa cells were transfected with indicated constructs, and after 24 hours, cell lysates were prepared and
incubated with the puriﬁed GST–SH3 domain (from Src) bound to agarose beads or GST beads alone for 4 hours. Bag3 associated with the Src SH3 domain
was analyzed via immunoblot with anti-FLAG antibody.

and R480A constructs also demonstrated reduced binding to
the Src-SH3 domain compared with the full-length Bag3, and
the effects of these mutations were comparable with the effect
of the PxxP deletion (Fig. 1E). Therefore, interaction with
Hsp70 seems to be critical for binding of the PxxP domain of
Bag3 with the SH3 domain of Src.
These ﬁndings, that the interaction of Bag3 with Src requires
the association with Hsp70, suggest that Bag3 may serve as a
scaffold, mediating the effects of Hsp70 on signaling pathways,
including Src. In line with this hypothesis, knockdown of
Hsp70 led to signiﬁcant activation of Src, as judged by its

www.aacrjournals.org

Y416 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, depletion of
Hsp70 increased phosphorylation of downstream Src targets
paxillin and p130Cas (Fig. 2B), conﬁrming Src activation.
Interestingly, knockdown of Bag3 did not activate Src; however, it prevented activation of Src upon depletion of Hsp70
(Fig. 2A). Therefore, (i) Hsp70 can regulate Src activity, and
(ii) this regulation requires Bag3.
To further investigate the role of Hsp70–Bag3 module in Src
regulation, we tested effects on Src of Bag3 mutants that are
unable to bind to Hsp70. Although overexpression of the fulllength Bag3 did not affect Src activity, overexpression of either

the model.
Hsp70–Bag3 module affects NF-kB
Upon establishing the general mechanistic principle that
Hsp70 and Bag3 can cooperate in direct regulation of signaling
factors, we further sought to identify a spectrum of cancercontrolling signaling factors regulated by the Hsp70–Bag3
module. We used a combination of two general criteria for
such regulation: the signaling factor should be affected (i) by
Hsp70 and Bag3 depletion, and (ii) by overexpression of the DB
or R480A Bag3 constructs but not of the normal Bag3.
In this search, we used our prior data, where we used
microarray analysis to compare gene expression in control
and Hsp70-depleted MCF7 cells (Supplementary Table S1),
followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The GSEAbased signal pathway analysis software was developed by the
Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA). According to their manual,
pathways that show a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.25
are signiﬁcant enough to warrant validation. Our analysis
indicated that a large number of pathways were predicted to
be up- or downregulated by Hsp70. For example, the proteasome and ubiquitin pathways were strongly upregulated and
received the highest scores (see Supplementary Fig. S1A).

4734

Cancer Res; 74(17) September 1, 2014

Another pathway that received a high score was the NF-kB
(Fig. 3A) and related pathways, such as the IL1R, or TNF
pathways (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Indeed, using a luciferase
reporter under the control of NF-kB, we conﬁrmed that NF-kB
activity was increased in Hsp70-depleted cells (Fig. 3B). Also,
levels of IkB were reduced, whereas phosphorylation of the p65
subunit of NF-kB was elevated (Fig. 3C).
Here, we tested if Bag3 is involved in regulation of NF-kB
by Hsp70. Accordingly, Bag3 was depleted in MCF7 cells
using shRNA, and the activity of NF-kB was assessed using
the luciferase reporter. Unlike Hsp70, depletion of Bag3 had
little apparent effect on the activation of NF-kB (Fig. 3B) or
the levels of phosphorylated NF-kB p65 subunit (p-S536)
and of IkB (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, in cells with Bag3
depletion, the ability of the knockdown of Hsp70 to activate
NF-kB was strongly reduced (Fig. 3B). Therefore, as with Src
regulation, the Hsp70–Bag3 module is critical for regulation
of NF-kB.
Notably, it was previously reported that that Bag3 regulates
NF-kB by controlling IKKg stability (37), but we were unable
to detect any change in IKKg levels following Bag3 depletion
(Fig. 3C). On the other hand, a recent proteomics study (38)
indicated that Bag3 can directly interact with IkB, which is
consistent with our ﬁnding that the Hsp70–Bag3 module
affects IkB levels (Fig. 3B and C).

Effects of the Hsp70–Bag3 module on other cancerrelated signaling factors
Because the unbiased approach with GSEA produced only
limited information about signaling network regulated by
the Hsp70–Bag3 module, in further search for factors regulated by this module, we used a more biased approach
based on hints obtained in our prior ﬁndings. Accordingly,
we decided to test if the regulation of previously identiﬁed
Hsp70-controlled signaling factors also involved Bag3. In
studies of the OIS and tumor initiation, we reported that
depletion of Hsp70 affects two important signaling proteins
that control growth of cancer cells: the cell-cycle inhibitor
p21 and the regulator of mitosis, survivin (5, 17). To test if
Bag3 is also involved in control of these factors, we investigated whether depletion of Bag3 in MCF7 using shRNA
affects levels of p21 and survivin. As with knockdown of
Hsp70, Bag3 targeting resulted in decreased levels of survivin, and accumulation of p21 (Fig. 3D, top). Similar effects of
Hsp70 and Bag3 depletion were seen in HeLa cells (Fig. 3E)
and the colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCT116 (Supplementary Fig. S2), demonstrating that these effects are related to
multiple cancer types. Bag3 depletion paralleled the effects
of Hsp70 knockdown in all three cell lines, further supporting the idea that Hsp70 and Bag3 are coregulators of these
pathways. In line with this suggestion, overexpression of the
DB and R480A Bag3 mutants, but not normal Bag3, in HeLa
cells mimicked effects of Hsp70 depletion on survivin (Fig.
3F). In this experiment, we were unable to assess effects on
Bag3 mutants on p21, because levels of this protein in HeLa
cells were undetectable.
Because both p21 and survivin have a common transcriptional regulator, FoxM1, we tested whether the Hsp70–Bag3
module can control this cancer-regulating factor. Indeed,
depletion of either Hsp70 or Bag3 led to strong downregulation
of FoxM1 (Fig. 3D, top) and upregulation of its distinct downstream target, the cell-cycle inhibitor p27 (39). Furthermore,
although the levels of FoxM1 were unaltered in normal Bag3
and empty vector control conditions, the DB or R480A Bag3
mutants caused strong downregulation of FoxM1 (Fig. 3F),
indicating the importance of Hsp70–Bag3 interaction in
expression of this major transcription factor. Because FoxM1
plays multiple roles in OIS, metastasis, and invasion (40), these
ﬁndings further support a broad role for the Hsp70–Bag3
module in tumorigenesis.
On the basis of our prior study that connected the stress
response to the translation factor HuR, another major player in
cancer development (41, 42), we also suggested that the
Hsp70–Bag3 module may affect this pathway. Depletion of
either Hsp70 or Bag3 led to signiﬁcant downregulation of HuR
(Fig. 3D, top). Furthermore, although the levels of HuR were
unaltered in normal Bag3 and empty vector control conditions,
the DB or R480A Bag3 mutants caused strong downregulation
of HuR, indicating that interaction between Hsp70 and Bag3 is
important for regulation of this major cancer regulator (Fig.
3F). In addition, we considered whether one of HuR's translational targets, Hif1a, which is yet another major transcription factor involved in cancer, might also be downregulated.
Because levels of Hif1a depend on the availability of oxygen,

4736

Cancer Res; 74(17) September 1, 2014

control, Hsp70-depleted, and Bag3-depleted cells were treated
with either hypoxia mimetic deferoxamine, or proteasomal
inhibitor MG-132, both of which stabilize Hif1a. Hsp70-depleted or Bag3-depleted MCF7 cells had signiﬁcantly reduced
levels of Hif1a compared with control cells (Fig. 3D, bottom).
Furthermore, Hsp70 depletion strongly reduced expression of a
major Hif1 downstream target gene VEGF (Fig. 3G). Therefore,
it seems that the entire signaling network that controls multiple processes in cancer development, including growth,
invasion, and angiogenesis, involving HuR, Hif1a, and VEGF,
is regulated by Bag3 and Hsp70. It should be noted that only
with Src did we identify a direct connection to the Hsp70–Bag3
module biochemically. With other pathways, genetic data do
not establish the direct interaction, and therefore these interactions could be mediated by additional factors that can bind
to WW or PxxP motifs on Bag3.
In summary, the Hsp70–Bag3 module is involved in regulating a complex network of pathways, including Src, NFkB, FoxM1, survivin, p21, p27, HuR, Hif1a, and most likely,
other pathways, all of which play a role in cancer development. When individually considered, these pathways could
have cancer-promoting or cancer-repressing effects. Nevertheless, we know that in breast cancer models, depletion of
Hsp70 suppresses both tumor initiation and progression (5),
indicating that the net outcome of this complex Hsp70Bag3–controlled signaling network to be prooncogenic.
Disruption of the Hsp70–Bag3 complex by a small
molecule mimics effects of Hsp70 depletion on signaling
and cancer
Here, we predicted that blocking interaction between
Hsp70 and Bag3 could mimic depletion of Hsp70 and have
anticancer effects. We focused on an inhibitor of Hsp70,
termed YM-1 (43, 44). To test if YM-1 might disrupt the
Hsp70–Bag3 interaction, we immobilized Hsp70 on beads
and measured its binding to ﬂuorescently labeled Bag3 using
a ﬂow cytometry protein interaction assay (FCPIA). YM-1
strongly inhibited the interaction between Hsp70 and Bag3
(IC50, 5 mmol/L; Fig. 4A). This activity was consistent with
the ability of YM-1 to bind to a conserved, allosteric pocket
in Hsp70, which traps the chaperone in an ADP-bound form
that has weak afﬁnity for Bag3 (43, 44). To test if YM-1 can
disrupt the Hsp70–Bag3 interaction in cells, Hsp70 was
immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells treated with YM-1 or
a vehicle control, and immunoblotted for Bag3. YM-1 almost
completely blocked binding of Hsp70 to Bag3 in cells (Fig.
4B), indicating that YM-1 is a good chemical probe for
addressing the importance of the Hsp70–Bag3 interaction
in cancer signaling.
Next, MCF7 and HeLa cells were treated with YM-1 and the
activities of signaling pathways were assessed. To determine
the appropriate dosage, a range of concentrations were tested
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The concentrations of YM-1 used for
testing effects on signaling pathways are described in the
legend to Fig. 4, but represent the minimal dose necessary to
see an effect in the appropriate cell line. As predicted, YM-1
diminished the FoxM1 and Hif1a pathways, while activating
Src (Fig. 4C), further supporting a role for the Hsp70–Bag3

interaction in cancer signaling. As a further test of this model,
we examined the effects of the small-molecule inhibitor myricetin, which inhibits Hsp70, through a different mechanism
that involves the Hsp40 family of cochaperones (45), and does
not hinder Bag3 binding to Hsp70. Unlike YM-1, myricetin had
no signiﬁcant effects on the signaling pathways (Table 1),
highlighting the speciﬁc role of the Hsp70–Bag3 interaction.
Because many of the Hsp70-Bag3–regulated pathways affect
cell growth and survival, and depletion of Hsp70 is detrimental

for cancer cells speciﬁcally due to oncogene signaling (5), we
compared effects of YM-1 on viability of nontransformed
MCF10A human breast epithelial cells and MCF10A derivatives
transformed with either Her2 or PIK3CA oncogenes (Fig. 5A).
Here, cells expressing oncogenes were more sensitive to YM-1
than untransformed MCF10A cells (Fig. 5A).
To test the effects of YM-1 in vivo, we used the xenograft
model with MCF7 cells, which we previously showed lose the
ability to develop tumors upon depletion of Hsp70 (5). MCF7
cells were transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice, and
when tumors reached the palpable stage, animals were
injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg YM-1 or saline. The
injections were injected three times every second day, and
tumor growth was monitored by caliper. Figure 5B shows that
administration of YM-1 dramatically inhibited tumor growth.
There were no apparent effects of the drug on the health and
vitality of the animals at the effective doses used. In fact, they
were more alert than untreated animals due to the lower tumor
burden. The inhibition of tumor growth by the drug closely
correlated with suppression of FoxM1, downregulation of
survivin, and induction of p21 (Fig. 5C and Supplementary

experiment because the levels of Hif1 were undetectable in
either na€ve or YM-1–treated animals. We also tested effects of
YM-1 on a distinct tumor model, allograft tumor of B16
melanoma cells. B16 cells were transplanted subcutaneously
into nude mice, and at day 7 posttransplantation (day 0 on the

with 25 mg/kg YM-1 or saline. The injections were injected
three times every second day, and tumor growth was monitored by caliper. As seen in Fig. 5B, administration of YM-1
signiﬁcantly reduced tumor growth. Therefore, YM-1 showed a
predictable response in animals, which correlated with strong
suppression of growth of two distinct tumor types with minimal normal tissue toxicity.

Discussion
Here, we investigated potential mechanisms of regulation of
cancer signaling by Hsp70. We speciﬁcally focused on Bag3, the
member of the Bag family proteins that functions in Hsp70
nucleotide exchange. The focus was deﬁned by prior reports
that Bag3 can interact with signaling molecules, via its PxxP
and WW domains. In other words, via its Bag domain, Bag3
may regulate the chaperone activity of Hsp70 by controlling the
ADP/ATP exchange, and via PxxP and WW motifs, it can also
regulate activities of important signaling pathways. Therefore,
Bag3 may potentially be able to integrate the Hsp70 chaperone
network with a network of signaling pathways. Using both
biochemical and genetic approaches, we demonstrated
that effects of Hsp70 in regulation of signaling are mediated

Hsp70–Bag3 and Cancer Signaling

by Bag3. Surprisingly, whereas depletion of Bag3 had similar
effects on some signaling pathways as depletion of Hsp70 (e.g.,
on FoxM1 or Hif1a), in other cases, depletion of Bag3 did not
affect signaling but was necessary for Hsp70 effects (e.g., with
NF-kB or Src). Therefore, in control of signaling pathways by
Bag3–Hsp70 pair, each individual target may be subject to
speciﬁc regulatory mechanisms. Although more work is needed, we suggest that these differences could be related to
speciﬁc ways in which the signaling modules interact with
Bag3. For example, whereas the Bag3 regulation of Src is
mediated by the PxxP domain, the interaction with other
pathways could be through the WW or M domains.
We undertook several unbiased and biased approaches to
dissect cancer-related pathways regulated by the Hsp70–Bag3
module. We observed that Hsp70–Bag3 controls activities of
multiple signaling factors that are involved in cancer development. The number of the factors was relatively large, consistent
with a broad "hub" role for Hsp70 in cancer. We validated a
subset of these pathways, and found that Hsp70 depletion
downregulates Hif1a and FoxM1, whereas upregulating the
NF-kB pathways. Interestingly, the former effects would presumably be anticancerous, whereas the latter is likely to be
cancer-promoting. These disparate responses to the same stimulus should not be very surprising because similar phenomena
have been observed with other anticancer treatments. For
example, radiation triggers the anticancer p53 pathway and
also cancer-promoting NF-kB and c-Abl (46, 47). In this case and
in the case of Hsp70 depletion, the net effect is anticancerous.
Previously, Hsp70 knockout was shown to prevent development of Her2-positive tumors in a mouse model by suppressing
OIS (5), indicating that Hsp70 plays an important role at the
early stages of tumor development. Our ﬁndings that the
Hsp70–Bag3 module affects pathways regulating angiogenesis
and invasion (e.g., Hif1a or FoxM1), suggest that Hsp70 may
play a broader role in cancer development. Although it has
been reported that Hsp70 is seen at elevated levels in low-grade
tumors (48) curiously, the levels of Hsp70 increase further in
high-grade cancers (3, 4), consistent with distinct role(s) of
Hsp70 in later stages of cancer progression, such as invasion.

Overall, this work pointed to a key role for the Hsp70–Bag3
complex in cancer, and suggests that this pair may represent a
promising drug target. Of the available Hsp70 inhibitors, YM-1
is a unique probe because it speciﬁcally traps the ADP-bound
form of Hsp70 (43). These observations suggested to us that
YM-1 might block the Hsp70–Bag3 interaction because Bag3
has a weak afﬁnity for the ADP-bound form of Hsp70 and it
normally favors client release (J.E. Gestwicki; manuscript in
preparation). Thus, although the known binding site for YM-1
is more than 20 Å from the contact surface between Hsp70
and Bag3, allosteric regulation of Hsp70 by YM-1 would be
predicted to interrupt nucleotide exchange factor binding.
Accordingly, YM-1 has a mechanism of action that is unique
among the known Hsp70 inhibitors, which positions it to
destabilize Hsp70–Bag3 activities in cancer cells, leading to
suppression of cancer-promoting signaling pathways. Consistently, YM-1 had anticancer activity in cells and in a xenograft
model. These results validate the Hsp70–Bag3 complex as a
potential anticancer target.
