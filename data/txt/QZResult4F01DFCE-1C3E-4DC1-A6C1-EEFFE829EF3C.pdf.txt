Abstract

Author Manuscript

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most frequent form of kidney cancer1, is
characterized by elevated glycogen and fat deposition2. These consistent metabolic alterations are
associated with normoxic stabilization of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs)3, secondary to von
hippel-lindau (VHL) mutations that occur in over 90% of ccRCC tumours4. However, kidneyspecific VHL deletion in mice fails to elicit ccRCC-specific metabolic phenotypes and tumour
formation5, suggesting that additional mechanisms are essential. Recent large-scale sequencing
analyses revealed loss of several chromatin remodelling enzymes in a subset of ccRCC
(polybromo 1 [PBRM1] ~40%, SET domain containing 2 [SETD2] ~15%, BRCA1 associated
protein-1 [BAP1] ~15%, etc.)6–9, indicating that epigenetic perturbations are likely important
contributors to the natural history of this disease. Here we utilized an integrative approach
comprising pan-metabolomic profiling and metabolic gene set analysis, and determined that the
gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1)10 is uniformly depleted in over six
hundred ccRCC tumours examined. Importantly, the human FBP1 locus resides on chromosome
9q22, whose loss is associated with poor prognosis for ccRCC patients11. Our data further indicate

that FBP1 inhibits ccRCC progression through two distinct mechanisms: 1) FBP1 antagonizes
glycolytic flux in renal tubular epithelial cells, the presumptive ccRCC cell of origin12, thereby
inhibiting a potential “Warburg effect”13,14, and 2) in pVHL-deficient ccRCC cells, FBP1
restrains cell proliferation, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway in a catalytic activityindependent manner, by inhibiting nuclear HIF function via direct interaction with the HIF
“inhibitory domain”. This unique dual function of the FBP1 protein explains its ubiquitous loss in
ccRCC, distinguishing FBP1 from previously-identified tumour suppressors (PBRM1, SETD2,
BAP1, etc.) which are not consistently mutated in all tumours6,7,15.

We performed pan-metabolomic analysis (Methods) on 20 primary human ccRCC tumours
and matching normal kidney tissues. Levels of metabolites involved in glycolysis,
gluconeogenesis, and glucose-related sugar metabolism were highly elevated in tumours,
suggesting that reprogramming of glucose metabolism is critical for ccRCC progression
(Extended Data Fig. 1a). Furthermore, metabolic gene set analysis16 on TCGA ccRCC
RNAseq data indicated that the “carbohydrate storage” group was the most significantly
underexpressed gene set in ccRCC tumours (Fig. 1a), including three genes controlling renal
gluconeogenesis17 (glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit [G6PC], phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase 1 [PCK1], and fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1 [FBP1]) (Extended Data Fig.
1b–c). Elevated HIF activity in ccRCC tumours stimulates aerobic glycolysis by increasing
the expression of glycolytic genes, including phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and lactate
dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and shunting glycolytic flux away from the TCA cycle by
activating pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1)3. However, our integrative analyses
identified suppression of gluconeogenesis as an additional component of glucose regulation
in ccRCCs. Next, we determined that the rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme FBP1 was
inhibited at the level of protein accumulation in almost 100% of ccRCC tumours examined
(n>200, Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c) compared to normal kidney tissue. Similar
results were observed for hepatocellular carcinomas and normal liver tissue (Extended Data
Fig. 2d–e). FBP1 inhibition is not mediated by ccRCC-associated HIF activation, because
HIF1α ablation failed to de-repress FBP1 expression in RCC4 ccRCC cells (Extended Data
Fig. 2f). Moreover, HK-2 proximal tubule cells (from which ccRCCs appear to be derived12)
exhibited HIF1α-dependent induction of FBP1 under hypoxia (Extended Data Fig. 2g–h).
Compared to FBP1, the other two gluconeogenic enzymes G6PC and PCK1 were either
modestly suppressed (G6PC), or exhibited no consistent change (PCK1) in ccRCC tumours
(Extended Data Fig. 3a–b). Interestingly, the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (liver
type, PFKL), which functionally antagonizes FBP1 in glycolysis (Extended Data Fig. 1c),
was expressed at equal levels in ccRCC and normal kidney tissues (Extended Data Fig. 3c).
In addition, lower FBP1 expression correlates significantly with advanced tumour stage and
worse patient prognosis (Fig. 1c–d), whereas PFKL expression does not (Extended Data Fig.
3d–e), suggesting that FBP1 may harbour novel, non-enzymatic function(s).
To investigate functional roles for FBP1 in ccRCC progression, we ectopically expressed
FBP1 in 786-O ccRCC tumour cells to levels observed in HK-2 proximal tubule cells
(Extended Data Fig. 4a). FBP1 expression significantly inhibited 2D culture (Fig. 1e),
anchorage-independent (Extended Data Fig. 4b), and xenograft tumour growth (Fig. 1f and
Extended Data Fig. 4c). Similarly, enforced FBP1 expression inhibited growth of RCC10

and 769-P ccRCC cells (Extended Data Fig. 4d–e), and A549 lung cancer cells preferentially
under hypoxia (Extended Data Fig. 4f and 4g). These results demonstrated that FBP1 can
suppress ccRCC and other tumour cell growth, an effect significantly pronounced when
coupled with HIF activation. In HK-2 cells, FBP1 depletion, but not G6PC ablation or
ectopic PFKL expression, was sufficient to promote HK-2 cell growth (Fig. 1g and
Extended Data Fig. 4h–j).

Since FBP1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis10, we manipulated FBP1
expression in renal cells and measured glucose metabolism. FBP1 inhibition increased
glucose uptake and lactate secretion in HK-2 cells cultured in 10 mM glucose, (Fig. 2a), an
effect augmented by lowering glucose levels to 1 mM (Extended Data Fig. 5a–b). To assess
glycolytic flux, we performed isotopomer distribution analysis using [1, 2-13C] glucose as
the tracer, which produces glycolytic and TCA intermediates containing two 13C atoms (M2
species), as well as corresponding M1 species from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP;
Extended Data Fig. 5c). We observed elevated M2 enrichment of four TCA intermediates
(malate, aspartate, glutamate, and citrate) in FBP1-depleted HK-2 cells (Fig. 2b–c). In
contrast, G6PC inhibition failed to promote glucose-lactate turnover (data not shown),
suggesting that FBP1, but not G6PC, is a critical regulator of glucose metabolism in renal
cells. Consistent with this result, ectopic FBP1 expression in a VHL-deficient ccRCC cell
line (RCC10) reduced glucose uptake, lactate secretion, and glucose-derived TCA cycle
intermediates (Fig. 2d–e). Reduced glucose-dependent TCA flux is known to increase
anaplerotic glutamine flux18, and we also observed elevated glutamine uptake and
enrichment of glutamine-derived TCA cycle intermediates (M4 species) in [U-13C]
glutamine-labelled RCC10 cells expressing FBP1 (Extended Data Fig. 5d–f).

Pan-metabolomic analyses of ccRCC tumours revealed a marked elevation of reduced
glutathione (G-SH)19 (Extended Data Fig. 5g). G-SH synthesis requires the reduced form of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), generated primarily though the
PPP in human cells19 (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Consistent with increased PPP flux, ccRCC
tumours display significant accumulation of G-SH and PPP-related metabolites (Extended
Data Fig. 5g), an effect partially recapitulated in FBP1-depleted HK-2 cells (Extended Data
Fig. 5h–j). Conversely, FBP1 re-expression in RCC10 cells significantly reduced NADPH
levels and PPP flux (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5k–l). Interestingly, FBP1-mediated
changes in PPP flux (Extended Data Fig. 5j and 5l) were comparable to the changes in
glucose 6-phosphate (G6P; Extended Data Fig. 5m–n), the entry metabolite of PPP pathway
(Extended Data Fig. 5c), suggesting that FBP1 affects PPP flux primarily through regulating
glycolysis. Surprisingly, the ability of FBP1 to reduce glycolysis and NADPH levels was
completely abolished in RCC10VHL cells (Fig. 2d and 2f), where wild-type pVHL was
introduced into RCC10 to exclude normoxic HIF expression (Extended Data Fig. 5o),
indicating that HIF proteins are required for FBP1-mediated effects on glucose metabolism
in ccRCC tumour cells.
To investigate a mechanistic link between FBP1 expression and HIF activity, we employed
two VHL-deficient ccRCC lines, RCC4 and RCC10, which express both HIF1α and HIF2α
(Extended Data Fig. 6a). HIF1α and HIF2α are induced at different stages of ccRCC and
play cooperating and contrasting roles in tumour progression3. HIF1α and HIF2α function

by binding hypoxia response elements (HREs) within target genes, including those
modulating cellular metabolism20. Interestingly, ectopic FBP1 expression suppressed HIF
activity (Fig. 3a) and promoted oxygen consumption in RCC4 and RCC10 cells (Extended
Data Fig. 6b–c). Furthermore, FBP1 expression in RCC10 cells restored PDH activity
(Extended Data Fig. 6d–f), which was otherwise inhibited by HIF1α3. Conversely, FBP1
ablation enhanced HIF activity in RCC10 cells, which express detectable levels of FBP1
(Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). This inverse correlation between FBP1 expression and
HIF activity was recapitulated in primary ccRCC tumours (Fig. 3b). In contrast, G6PC
expression did not correlate with HIF activity in ccRCC cells or tumour tissues (Extended
Data Fig. 6g–h). Interestingly, FBP1 also inhibited HIF activity in A549 lung cancer cells
cultured at 0.5% O2 (Fig. 3c), demonstrating that this effect is not specific to renal cells.
Moreover, FBP1 expression reduced canonical HIF target (PDK1, LDHA, glucose
transporter 1 [GLUT1, also known as SLC2A1], and vascular endothelial growth factor
[VEGF]) mRNA levels in RCC4, RCC10, and hypoxic A549 cells, but not in normoxic
RCC10VHL cells (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6i–k). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) analyses indicated that FBP1 was enriched at the HREs of PDK1, LDHA, GLUT1,
and VEGF promoters, but not in the non-hypoxia responsive ribosomal protein L13A
(RPL13A) promoter (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 7a). ChIP-reChIP analyses revealed colocalization of HIF1α and FBP1 at these HREs (Extended Data Fig. 7b), suggesting that
FBP1 directly inhibits HIF in the nucleus, a conclusion supported by cellular fractionation
and immunofluorescent staining of primary human kidney tissue (Fig. 3f and Extended Data
Fig. 7c–d). Furthermore, a nucleus-excluded form of FBP1 (FBP1 NES) containing a potent
nuclear export sequence21 fused to the FBP1 C-terminus (Extended Data Fig. 7e) failed to
inhibit HIF target gene expression as efficiently as wild-type FBP1 (Extended Data Fig. 7f).
Expression of FBP1 NES neither suppressed RCC10 cell growth nor altered glucose-lactate
turnover, in contrast to wild-type FBP1 (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 7g–h). Collectively,
these data demonstrated that nuclear FBP1 is required for inhibiting HIF and glucose
metabolism in VHL–deficient ccRCC cells (Extended Data Fig. 7i).

To determine whether FBP1 enzymatic activity is required to inhibit HIF, we expressed a
previously described, catalytically inactive FBP1 G260R mutant22,23 (Fig. 4a and Extended
Data Fig. 8a–b) in RCC10 and 786-O cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a and 8c). FBP1 G260R
inhibited cell growth to a comparable level of wild-type FBP1 at 10 mM glucose (Fig. 4b
and Extended Data Fig. 8d). FBP1 also inhibited glucose metabolism, NADPH production,
and HIF target gene expression to the same extent of wild-type FBP1 in RCC10 cells
(Extended Data Fig. 8e–h). These results suggest that FBP1 interferes with HIF function
through a catalytic activity-independent mechanism. In normoxic RCC10VHL cells (low
HIF activity), the ability of the FBP1 G260R mutant to inhibit cell growth, glucose
metabolism, NADPH production, and HIF target gene expression was abolished (Extended
Data Fig. 8c and 8i–m), further confirming that FBP1 impacts ccRCC cell metabolism and
growth by regulating HIF, independent of its enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, wild-type
FBP1 suppressed RCC10 and 786-O (Extended Data Fig. 9a–b) cell growth more potently
than the G260R mutant under low glucose conditions, presumably because the enzymatic
inhibition of glycolysis by wild-type FBP1 is more profound when glucose supply becomes
limited.

To explore the molecular mechanism(s) whereby FBP1 inhibits HIF activity, we separated
the FBP1 protein into an N-terminal regulatory (“R”) domain containing allosteric
regulatory sites and a C-terminal (“C”) domain containing the catalytic site (Fig. 4a).
Interestingly, ectopically expressing the FBP1 “R” domain in RCC10, RCC4, and 786-O
cells was sufficient to inhibit HIF activity, whereas expressing the “C” domain was not (Fig.
4c and Extended Data Fig. 9c–d). As 786-O cells express HIF2α but not functional
HIF1α24, we conclude that FBP1 inhibits both HIF1α and HIF2α, presumably through a
similar mechanism. To further map critical FBP1 regions for HIF recognition, we
systematically deleted each exon from full-length FBP1 (Extended Data Fig. 9e). All seven
FBP1 truncations exhibited minimal catalytic activity (Extended Data Fig. 9f), whereas only
the N-terminal Exon 1 and Exon 2 truncations significantly lost their ability to inhibit HIF
(Extended Data Fig. 9g).

We further demonstrated the association of FBP1 and HIF1α by co-immunoprecipitating
epitope-tagged and/or endogenous proteins from 293T or RCC10 cell lysates (Fig. 4d and
Extended Data Fig. 9h–i). FBP1 also associated with HIF2α (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig.
10a–b), but not with PHD2 or FIH1, two well-documented HIFα regulators3 (Extended Data
Fig. 10c). Interestingly, GST pull-down assays revealed that HIF1α or HIF2α proteins
bound directly to full-length FBP1 (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 10d), and the interaction
between HIF1α and FBP1 is dependent on FBP1 Exon 1 or Exon 2 (Fig. 4g). Furthermore,
FBP1 associates with the relatively uncharacterized HIF “inhibitory domain” (ID)25 (Fig. 4h
and Extended Data Fig. 10e). To examine whether FBP1 inhibits HIF activity through ID
recognition, we replaced the HIFα DNA binding domain with a GAL4 DNA binding
domain (GBD) and performed GAL4 transactivation assays (Extended Data Fig. 10e) (see
Methods for details). Consistent with HIF reporter assays (Fig. 3a, 3c, 4c and Extended
Data Fig. 9g), FBP1 suppressed full-length HIF1α-GBD activity by approximately 50%
(Extended Data Fig. 10f, red column). Importantly, removal of the HIF1α ID largely
relieved the FBP1 inhibitory effect (Extended Data Fig. 10f). In HIF2α, the critical region
mediating FBP1 inhibition extended to the entire C-terminus (Extended Data Fig. 10g).
Therefore, FBP1 suppresses HIF1α and HIF2α activity by interacting with their C-terminal
regions, especially the ID motif.

Apart from VHL loss, ccRCCs exhibit remarkable genetic heterogeneity26. Recent largescale analyses identified frequent mutations in three epigenetic genes PBRM1, SETD2, and
BAP1, all of which reside in a 43 Mb region on chromosome 3p that encompasses VHL6–9.
Histologically, ccRCC is characterized by the “clear cell” phenotype resulting from
glycogen and lipid accumulation2, suggesting that metabolic perturbations are a defining
feature of these tumours. Here we demonstrate that the gluconeogenic enzyme FBP1 is
ubiquitously depleted in ccRCCs, consistent with our previous copy number analyses27.
Moreover, FBP1 exhibits dual tumour-suppressive functions mediated by two separate
domains, explaining the universal loss of FBP1 expression in ccRCC tumours. Collectively,
our data reveal an intriguing regulatory relationship between FBP1 and hypoxic responses in
renal carcinoma, which has implications for the metabolic regulation of all gluconeogenic
tissues (Supplementary Discussion).

786-O, RCC4, RCC10, 769-P, A549 and 293T cells were tested to confirm they are
mycoplasma negative, and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. HK-2
proximal tubular epithelial cells were cultured in Keratinocyte-SFM medium supplemented
with human recombinant epidermal growth factor 1–53 and bovine pituitary extract (Life
Technologies). Hypoxic conditions (0.5% O2) were achieved in a Ruskinn in vivO2 400
workstation, by supplementing ambient air with balanced N2 and CO2. For metabolic
labelling assays, cells were maintained in glucose-free DMEM (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Gemini Bio Products) and 10 mM [1, 2-13C] glucose

10% dialyzed FBS and 2 mM [U-13C] glutamine (Cambridge isotope).
Constructs

An HRE (hypoxia response element) reporter construct was generated by introducing
triplicate HRE motifs derived from the human PGK1 promoter in front of a luciferase
expression cassette in the pGL2-TK vector. ShRNA plasmids targeting human FBP1, G6PC
and HIF1A mRNAs were purchased from Open Biosystems. The antisense short-hairpin
sequences against human FBP1 are 5’-ATGTTGGAAGATCCATCAAGG-3’ (SH-1) and
5’-AACATGTTCATAACCAGGTCG-3’ (SH-2). The antisense sequence against human
G6PC is 5’- TTCAAGGAGTCAAAGACGTGC-3’, and sequences against human HIF1A is
5’-TAACTTCACAATCATAACTGG-3’ (SH-1) and 5’ATTCGGTAATTCTTTCATCAC-3’ (SH-2). FBP1, G6PC, and PFKL expression plasmids
were constructed by cloning the open reading frame of each cDNA into the multiple cloning
site of PCDNA3.1-V5 vector. The FBP1 G260R mutant was generated using Stratagene's
QuikChange II mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). FBP1 NES was generated by linking an efficient
nuclear export sequence (LALKLAGLDIGS) to the FBP1 C-terminus of its expression
cassette. FBP1 exon truncations were generated by subcloning the following coding regions
from full-length FBP1 (1–338): ΔE1 (58–338), ΔE2 (1–57, 112–338), ΔE3 (1–111, 143–
338), ΔE4 (1–142, 189–338), ΔE5 (1–188, 236–338), ΔE6 (1–235, 276–338), ΔE7 (1–275).
Full-length FBP1, HIF1α, and HIF2α were cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector to create
GST-tagged protein constructs. Various GST-tagged HIF1α motifs were generated by
subcloning the following regions from full-length HIF1α (1–826) into the pGEX-6P-1
vector: bHLH (1–80), PASA (81–235), PASB (236–329), LINK (330–392), NODD (393–

HIFα sequences lacking the bHLH DNA binding motif were cloned into the pBIND vector
(Promega), which is in frame with a GAL4 DNA binding domain (GBD) at the N-terminus.
A series of GBD-HIF1α truncations were created by removing indicated HIF1α motifs.
Similarly, GBD-HIF2α truncations were generated by individually deleting the following
motifs from HIF2α sequences (1–870): PASA (80–236), PASB (237–331), LINK (332–
395), NODD (396–495), NTAD (496–581), ID (582–830), CTAD (831–870). GFP-FIH1
and GFP-PHD2 constructs were obtained from Dr. Eric Metzen via Addgene.
Plasmid transfection and virus infection

Author Manuscript

Expression constructs were transfected into cancer cell lines using Lipofectamine LTX
reagent (Life Technologies) by following the manufacturer’s protocol. Lentivirus was
produced by co-transfecting 293T cells with pRSV-Rev, pMD2.G, pMDLg/pRRE, and
pLKO.1-puro shRNA or pCDH-puro expression vectors. Virus was harvested after 48 hours
by filtering the virus-containing medium through 0.45 µM Steriflip filter (Millipore). Virus
infection was performed by incubating cells with medium containing indicated virus and 8
µg/mL polybrene (Sigma) for 24 hours. Cells were allowed to recover in complete medium
for 24 hours and then selected with puromycin for 24 hours (mRNA analysis) or 48 hours
(protein and phenotypic analyses). Surviving pools were subjected to indicated experiments.
Note that HK-2 cells undergoing virus infection and puromycin selection typically need 10–
14 days recovery time before subjected to experiments.
TCGA RNAseq analysis

Raw RNAseq data for 480 ccRCC tumour and 69 normal kidney tissues were downloaded
from the TCGA ccRCC project (http://cancergenome.nih.gov) on April 2, 2013. Data was
analysed for differential gene expression using DeSeq (Bioconductor Version 2.12).
Normalized counts, p-values, false discovery rate-adjusted p values (p-adj), and fold
expression change for each gene were exported. To perform the gene set analysis, a
comprehensive list of 2,752 genes encoding all known human metabolic enzymes and
transporters were clustered into functional sets according to the metabolic pathways
annotated by KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). The cut-off value of p-adj was set to 0.1
to exclude genes not consistently detected by RNAseq. To examine tumour-associated HIF
activities, raw data of each sequenced gene were rescaled to set the median equal to 1, and
HIF activities were quantified by averaging the normalized expression of 44 HIF target
genes including those encoding IGFBP3, EDN2, PFKFB4, FLT1, TFR2, BNIP3L, TGFA,
BNIP3, PGK1, EGLN1, LDHA, EGLN3, CP, TGFB3, PFKFB3, HK1, TFRC, EDN1,

NADPH or G6P levels were normalized to vector control cells by set the vector control
levels equal to 1. Pan-metabolomic analysis was performed on 20 primary ccRCC tumours
and 20 adjacent normal kidney tissues (obtained from Cooperative Human Tissue Network)
with the assistance of Metabolon. Specifically, sample preparation was carried out using the
automated MicroLab STAR® system (Hamilton). Standards were added prior to the first
extraction step for quality control purposes. Metabolite extracts were divided into two
fractions; one fraction was analysed by a gas chromatography – mass spectrometer (GCMS) and the other by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Samples for GC-MS analysis were dried under vacuum desiccation for 24 hours prior to
derivatization under nitrogen with bistrimethyl-silyl-triflouroacetamide (BSTFA) treatment.
The GC column was 5% phenyl and the temperature ramp was from 40 to 300 °C in a 16minute period. Samples were analysed by a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning
single-quadrupole mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization. The LC-MS/MS
portion of this analysis was based on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC and a Thermo-Finnigan
LTQ mass spectrometer, which consists of an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and linear
ion-trap (LIT) mass analyser. Sample extracts were split into two aliquots, dried, and
reconstituted separately in acidic or basic solvents. One aliquot was analysed in acidic
positive ion optimized conditions and the other in basic negative ion optimized conditions
using dedicated columns. Extracts reconstituted in acidic conditions were gradient eluted
using water and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid, while the basic extracts were eluted
using water and methanol containing 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The MS analysis
alternated between MS and MS/MS scans using dynamic exclusion. Compounds were
identified by comparison to an in-house metabolomic library with purified standards. More
than 3000 commercially-available standard compounds have been registered for
determination of their analytical characteristics. The combination of chromatographic
properties and mass spectra gave an indication of a match to a specific compound or an
isobaric entity. For studies spanning multiple days, a data normalization step was included to
correct variation resulted from instrumental tuning differences. To generate the end report,
raw data of each metabolite were rescaled to set the median equal to 1. For pair-wise
comparison of pentose phosphate pathway-related metabolites, Welch’s t-tests were
performed. A q-value is also reported to describe the false discovery rate in multiple testing.

To measure the 13C enrichment in TCA cycle intermediates, [1, 2-13C] glucose-labelled (48
hours at 37 °C) or [U-13C] glutamine-labelled cells (3 hours at 37 °C) were extracted by 4%
perchloric acid (PCA) as previously described29. Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS
and then incubated with 4% PCA for 30 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Cell extracts
were collected and neutralized using 5M KOH. After centrifugation, supernatants were
subjected to an AG-1 column (100–200 mesh, 0.5 × 2.5 cm, Bio-rad) for enriching the
organic acids, glutamate, and aspartate, which were then converted to t-butyldimethylsilyl
derivatives. Isotopic enrichment in 13C glutamate isotopomers was monitored using ions at
m/z 432, 433, 434, 435, 436 and 437 for M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 or M5 (containing 1 to 5 13C
atoms above M0, the natural abundance), respectively. Isotopic enrichment in 13C aspartate
isotopomers was monitored using ions at m/z 418, 419, 420, 421 and 422 for M0, M1, M2,
M3 and M4 (containing 1 to 4 13C atoms above M0, the natural abundance), respectively.

Isotopic enrichment in 13C lactate was determined using ions at m/z 261, 262, 263 and 264
for M0, M1, M2 and M3 (containing 1 to 3 13C atoms above natural abundance),
respectively. Isotopic enrichment in 13C pyruvate isotopomers was monitored using ions at
m/z 259, 260, 261and 262 for M0, M1, M2 and M3 (containing 1 to 3 13C atoms above

evaluated using ions at m/z 419, 420, 421, 422 and 423 for M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4
(containing 1 to 4 13C atoms above natural abundance), respectively, and 13C enrichment
in 13C citrate isotopomers was assayed using ions at m/z 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464 and
465 for M0, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6 (containing 1 to 6 13C atoms above natural
abundance), respectively. Isotopic enrichment in 13C ribose 5-phosphate isotopomers was
determined using a LC-MS system as previously described29. For ribose in MRM mode, we
measured ion-pairs 561-175, 562-175, 563-175, 564-175, 565-175 and 566-175 for
determination of M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5, respectively (containing 1 to 5 13C atoms
above natural abundance).
Quantification of the pentose phosphate pathway

Author Manuscript

Metabolic flux going through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was quantified based on
a previously-described method30, using [1, 2-13C] glucose as the labelling tracer. Briefly,
direct glycolysis of [1, 2-13C] glucose (without going through the PPP) produces M2
labelled lactate, while flux going through the oxidative portion of PPP removes the first
carbon from glucose and releases it in the form of CO2. The resultant M1 labelled
intermediates are recycled back to glycolysis to produce M1 labelled lactate through the
non-oxidative potion of PPP. The ratio of M1 to M2 labelled lactate indicates the ratio of
flux going through the PPP versus flux directly going through glycolysis. Therefore, PPP
flux was calculated based on the following formula: PPP flux = glucose consumption rate
(measured by YSI analyser as described above) × M1 lactate enrichment / (M1 lactate
enrichment + M2 lactate enrichment). Calculated PPP flux was then normalized to vector
control cells by setting the vector control flux equal to 1. An important assumption for this
model is that most PPP-generated M1 intermediates are recycled back to glycolysis, rather
than exported for nucleotide synthesis30. We have measured the isotopic distribution of
ribose 5-phosphate using LC-MS and found that the enrichment of M1 labelled ribose 5phosphate was undetectable, confirming that most M1 labelled intermediates generated in
PPP were recycled back to glycolysis.
Cell growth assay

Multiple cultures of ccRCC or A549 cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 5×104
cells/well supplemented with DMEM containing 1% FBS. For growth assays performed in
low glucose conditions, cells were maintained in glucose-free DMEM supplemented with
10% dialyzed FBS and 1 mM glucose. Each day one set of cultures was collected and
counted.

1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM NaVO4, 1 mM β-glycerol phosphate,
and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). For immunoprecipitation experiments,
cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 0.3% CHAPS instead of 1% Triton X-100 as
the detergent. 2 mg whole cell lysates were pre-cleared with 30 µL protein G beads (Life
Technologies), and then incubated with 2 µg isotype-matched IgG control or indicated
antibodies for 2 hours on a rocking platform. 50 µL protein G beads were added and mixed
for another 2 hours. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and then
resolved by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
and the filters incubated with indicated primary antibodies diluted in TBST (20 mM Tris,
135 mM NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin
(Sigma). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by exposure to ECL reagents
(Pierce).

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-reChIP assay

Author Manuscript

ChIP Assays were performed using Imgenex QuikChIP kit (Novus). Briefly, three million
RCC10 cells stably expressing V5-FBP1 were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde for 15 min
at 37 °C. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by glycine and cells were lysed in SDS
buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Cell lysates were sonicated to shear chromatin
DNA into fragments with 200–1,000 base pairs in size and then subjected to
immunoprecipitation with 5 µg IgG (Cell Signaling Technology), V5 (Life Technologies), or
Polymerase II (Imgenex) antibodies. After washing with a series of low salt and high salt
washing buffers, immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were de-crosslinked at 65 °C in high
salt condition, purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and then analysed by
qRT-PCR. For ChIP-reChIP assays, the first ChIP was performed using HIF1α antibody (5
µg, Novus), until the washing steps. The immunoprecipitated protein-DNA complexes were
incubated in ChIP-reChIP elution buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, and 20 mM
DTT, PH 7.5) for 30 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the isolated supernatant was diluted
at least 20 times and subjected to the second ChIP using 5 µg IgG or V5 antibodies. In both

Luciferase reporter and GAL4 transactivation assay

Author Manuscript

0.5 mg of HRE reporter construct was transfected into cells grown in 6-well plates together
with 0.05 mg Renilla luciferase and 1 mg indicated expression or shRNA plasmids.
Luciferase activities were measured 48 hours later using Dual Luciferase assay kit
(Promega). Reporter luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase, and then
rescaled to set the vector control signals equal to 1. In GAL4 transactivation assay, 0.3 mg
GBD-HIFα construct (using pBIND vector as backbone) was transfected into 769-P (GBDHIF1α) or A549 (GBD-HIF2α) cells together with 0.3 mg UAS (Upstream Activation

Protein purification

Author Manuscript

Constructs encoding indicated GST-tagged proteins were transformed into BL21-DE3
chemically competent E. coli (Life Technologies), grown in rocking LB media at 37 °C to
an OD600 value of 0.8. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG (Denville
Scientific) to the LB cultures, which were rocked at 37 °C for another 3 hours or at room
temperature overnight. After centrifugation, collected bacterial pellets were resuspended in
STE buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). GST-tagged proteins were further purified using the GST
inclusion body solubilisation and renaturation kit (Cell Biolabs) by following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
GST pull-down assay

Author Manuscript

Assay was performed using GST Protein Interaction Pull-Down Kit (Pierce) by following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Breifly,100 µg indicated GST-tagged “bait” proteins were
incubated with 50 µL prewashed glutathione agarose (Pierce) in 500 µL GST pull-down
buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, and 20 µg/mL BSA) for 1
hour at 4 °C. Meanwhile, 50 µg indicated “prey” proteins was precleared with 50 µL
prewashed glutathione agarose in 500 µL GST pull-down buffer for 1 hour at 4 °C.
Precleared “prey” solutions were combined with the “bait-agarose” solutions and mixed for
another 2 hours at 4 °C. Protein-bound agarose was washed 3 times and boiled in SDS
sample buffer. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.
Tissue immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Normal kidney tissue sections (from Cooperative Human Tissue Network) and tissue
microarray slides (KD801, KD208, BC07114, BC07115, LV804, LV208 from US Biomax)
were deparaffinized by baking slides at 60 °C for 30 min. The slides were rehydrated in
series of ethanol solutions and endogenous peroxidase activities were quenched by 3% H2O2
in distilled water for 30 min. After three washes in TT buffer (500 mM NaCl, 10 mM
Trizma, and 0.05% Tween-20), antigen retrieval was performed by boiling slides for 20 min
in a citrate-based antigen unmasking solution (Vector Labs). After cooling down to room
temperature, slides were incubated with 4% normal goat serum in TT buffer for 1 hour, and
then blocked with avidin and biotin solutions (avidin/biotin blocking Kit, Vector Labs).
Next, tissue slides were incubated with various primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. After
three washes in TT buffer, biotinylated secondary antibody was added onto these slides for 1
hour, following by 1 hour treatment of ABC reagents (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector Labs).
After three TT washes, the slides were processed with either chromogen (ImmPACT DAB
Substrate, Vector Labs) and hematoxylin solutions for immunohistochemistry staining, or
with Alexa Fluor 488 tyramide (TSA Kit #22, Life Technologies) for immunofluorescent
experiments. Finally, slides were either dehydrated and mounted with paramount solution
(for immunohistochemistry), or directly mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagents (Life
Technologies) supplemented with DAPI (for immunofluorescence).

Animal studies

Author Manuscript

Xenograft tumour experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at
the University of Pennsylvania. Briefly, five female NIH-III nude mice (Charles River, 4–6
weeks) were injected subcutaneously into both flanks with five million 786-O cells stably
expressing vector or FBP1. Before each injection, cells were resuspended in 150 µL DMEM
mixed with an equal volume of matrigel (BD Bioscience). Once palpable tumours were
established, tumour size was measured once a week with a digital calliper. After four weeks
mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and xenograft tumours were dissected and weighed.
Randomization and blinding are not applicable in this experiment.
Human subjects

Author Manuscript

Primary human kidney samples were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network
and handled at the University of Pennsylvania with the approval of its institutional review
board committees. All tissues are collected with the donor being informed and given
consent. Related procedures were performed in accordance with ethical and legal standards.
Survival analysis
Available patient survival data were obtained from the TCGA ccRCC project. Patients were
ranked based on their tumour expressions of indicated genes shown in TCGA RNAseq data.
The top half of ranked patients was defined as the “top 50% expression” group and the
lower half was defined as the “bottom 50% expression” group. Kaplan-Meier survival
analyses and log-rank significance tests were performed on these two patient groups
accordingly.
