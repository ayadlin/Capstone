BACKGROUND: Expression of DNA-repair proteins and activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) may differ according to
smoking status. The authors investigated whether p38 MAPK activity contributed to the viability of cisplatin in lung cancer cell lines
from never or light smokers and to ERCC1 mRNA expression. METHODS: Activated p38 MAPK was tested as a predictor for ERCC1
levels in 117 lung adenocarcinomas. Cell viabilities of NCI-H1975, NCI-H1793, NCI-H1650, and NCI-H1651 cell lines, derived from never or
light smokers, were measured after treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 and cisplatin. The role of p38a (MAPK14) and
p38b (MAPK11) isoforms and ERCC1 was evaluated using RNA interference. RESULTS: ERCC1 protein-level expression was predicted
by activated p38 MAPK in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. The p38-specific inhibitor SB202190 strongly decreased cell viability (43%63%). SB202190 plus cisplatin significantly decreased cell viability in every cell line, including cisplatin-resistant NCI-H1793. Genetic inhibition, targeting both MAPK11 and MAPK14, reduced the viability of the different cell lines: down-regulation of p38b accounted for
most of this effect. Cisplatin’s effect was greater after MAPK11 down-regulation for NCI-H1651, and MAPK14 down-regulation for NCIH1650. In addition, both SB202190 and MAPK11 inhibition reduced excision repair cross-complementing 1 mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer cells from never or light smokers rely on p38 MAPK signaling for survival. MAPK11 is involved in that pathway and
might contribute to ERCC1 expression. Sensitization to cisplatin can be achieved by pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK signalC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Smoking is, by far, the main contributor to lung cancer. Common treatments include surgery, cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In recent years, various targeted
molecular therapies, alone or combined with cisplatin, have been developed to treat advanced lung cancer. Drugs that target epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) are now used in the clinical setting. Lung cancer patients with no or minimal history of tobacco use show markedly better clinical outcomes when treated with these agents.1-3 Sensitivity to EGFR
inhibitors has been associated with EGFR mutations, which make cancer cells dependent on continued EGFR signaling
for proliferation and survival.4 Other differences in the genetic makeup of lung cancer cells from lung cancer patients who
have never smoked (never smokers) are important; however, nonsmoking status is the strongest predictor of benefit from
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.5
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), a class of serine/threonine kinases, are responsive to stress stimuli,
such as cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, heat shock, and osmotic shock, and are involved in cell differentiation and apoptosis.6 Four isoforms of p38 MAPK, p38a (MAPK14), p38b (MAPK11), p38c (MAPK12), and p38d (MAPK13), have
been identified. MAPK14 and MAPK11 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas MAPK12 and MAPK13 have more restricted patterns and are likely to have specialized functions.
The role of p38 MAPK in inflammatory disease has led to the development of a large number of small-molecule p38
inhibitors. Most of these compounds target MAPK14. Theoretically, they could be used to treat tumors that rely on
MAPK14 for progression, or could be combined with DNA-damaging chemotherapy to trigger the death of cancer cells
by impairing cell cycle arrest and DNA repair mechanisms.7
It is not clear whether p38 MAPK activity favors or inhibits cancer cell growth. A role for MAPK14 in increasing
cancer cell migration, tumor invasion, and metastasis has been supported by experiments that have used cancer-cell lines

where expression of matrix metalloproteinases and angiogenic factors are induced by p38 MAPK signaling.8-13
Conversely, direct evidence of a tumor suppressor role
for MAPK14 has been provided by knockout mice. Ventura et al reported that deletion of MAPK14 in adult
mice resulted in increased proliferation and defective differentiation of lung stem and progenitor cells, both in
vivo and in vitro.14 As a consequence, the inactivation of
MAPK14 leads to immature and hyperproliferative lung
epithelium that is highly sensitized to K-RASG12Vinduced tumorigenesis.
Chemotherapy induces p38 MAPK activity, which
contributes to the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin and other
chemotherapeutic agents.15 The effect of combining p38
inhibitors with cisplatin appears to depend to a large
extent on cell type. Studies are needed to determine which
types of cancer are likely to respond to therapies that target the p38 MAPK pathway.
Previously, we studied the expression of the p38
MAPK pathway in a large cohort of patients with lung
cancer.16 The results from our study showed that the p38
MAPK pathway was activated in a substantial proportion
of lung tumors (55%), a finding consistent with the
results reported by Greenberg et al.17 Importantly, by correlating the expression of activated p38 MAPK in tumor
cells with smoking status, we showed that it was strongly
associated with life-long nonsmoking, independent of
age, sex, and histological type.16
Many preclinical studies of cisplatin resistance have
reported the importance of cells’ abilities to repair DNA
damage. We and others have reported that the expression
of the ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementation
group 1) protein is a key predictor of the benefit of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in lung cancer.18,19 We have also
reported that the expression of ERCC1 in lung cancer cells
was higher in never smokers compared with smokers.20
Herein, we have studied the inhibition of the p38
MAPK pathway on the growth of lung tumor cells from
never smokers who had various mutational profiles and
sensitivities to cisplatin. We also explored whether
ERCC1 expression was related to p38 MAPK signaling in
both tissues and cell lines, and whether inhibition of p38
MAPK effected tumor cell sensitivity to cisplatin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Culture

All cell lines were purchased from the American Tissue
Culture Collection. H1793 and H1651 cells were grown
in DMEN/F12 medium, containing 2.5 mM L-glutamine, 0.02 mg/mL insulin, and 0.01 mg/mL transferrin,
5016

supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/
mL penicillin G sodium, and 100 lg/mL streptomycin
sulfate. H1650 cells and H1975 cells were grown in
RPMI-1640 with 2 mM L-glutamax, supplemented with
10% FCS and antibiotics, as above. Media and supplements for cell cultures were purchased from Gibco-Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif).
Cell Proliferation and Viability Assays

Cells were seeded at 3  103 per well, in 96-well microplates, in a final volume of 100 lL/well of culture medium and then grown for 24 hours. The cells were then
treated with 20 lM SB202190 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt,
Germany) for 30 minutes or with 20 lM cisplatin
(Merck, Frankfurt, Germany) for 3 hours, with or without 30 minutes of pretreatment with 20 lM SB202190.
Alternatively, cells were transfected with small interfering
(si)RNA (see below). Transfected cells were grown alone
or were treated 24 hours later with 20 lM cisplatin for 3
hours. After the treatments, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and supplemented with fresh complete medium. Measurements of viable cell mass were
performed 5 days later using a colorimetric-based reaction
by adding 10 lL/well of Cell Proliferation Reagent WST1 for 2 hours at 37 C, in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
Thereafter, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm
with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader.
Cell viability was expressed as viable cell mass after a given
treatment that was normalized to that of parallel cultures
of untreated cells (viable cell mass, %). Each experiment
was performed with at least 3 measurements for each condition. The results shown are the mean values of 3 such
experiments.
siRNA Transfections

SiRNAs for the down-regulation of the different p38
MAPK
isoforms
(Hs_MAPK14_5_HP
and
Hs_MAPK11_5_HP validated siRNAs), ERCC1
(Hs_ERCC1_4_HP), and negative control siRNA (AllStars Negative Control) were purchased from Qiagen
(Hilden, Germany). The sequences of the siRNAs used
for this study were as follows:
MAPK14 sense 50 -CUGCGGUUACUUAAACAU
ATT-30 , antisense 50 -UAUGUUUAAGUAACCGCAG
TT-30 ; MAPK11 sense 50 -GGAUGGAGCUGAUCCAG

24 hours, cells were transfected with the different siRNAs
to make final concentrations of 5 to 50 nM using Hiperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Control experiments were done in
parallel by transfecting the cells with the nonsilencing
control, siRNA (Qiagen), at equivalent concentrations to
the target siRNA. Vehicle containing Hiperfect alone was
applied to cells, and viable cells were considered as having
100% survival. Assays were performed in triplicate with at
least 3 measurements for each condition.

Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase
Chain Reaction

For real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, cells were seeded at 3
 104 cells per well, in 12-well plates, in a final volume
of 1 mL/well of culture medium. At 24 hours later, cells
were transfected with p38 siRNA or ERCC1 siRNA, or
the negative control siRNA, or were exposed to the p38
MAPK-specific inhibitor (SB202190) alone or combined with cisplatin, as described above. Cultures were
stopped after different time points (24, 48, and 72
hours) by adding 400 lL of RLT buffer (Qiagen). RNAs
were extracted using a RNeasy-micro kit (Qiagen).
cDNAs were synthesized using the M-MlV Rev transcriptase enzyme with random hexamers (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, Calif). Template cDNAs were
added to a Taqman PCR Universal Master Mix with specific primers (described below) and a probe for each
gene, to make a final volume of 25 lL (all reagents from
Applied Biosystems).
Primers for ERCC1 were GGGAATTTGGCGACGTAATTC (forward) and GCGGAGGCTGAGGAACAG (reverse), and 6FAM (carboxyfluorescein) 50 CACAGGTGCTCTGGCCCAGCACATA-30 ,
as
described previously.21 The endogenous reference genes
were PPIA (peptidylprolyl isomerase A) and RPLPO (ribosomal protein P0). Primers for MAPK14 (assay ID,
Hs00176247_m1)
and
MAPK11
(assay
ID,
Hs00177101_m1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Quantification of gene expression was performed
using the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression values
were calculated by the 2DDCt method using Sequence
Detection System 2.3 software (Applied Biosystems). The
amount of target gene was normalized to an endogenous
reference gene (PPIA, RPLPO RNAs) and was relative to a
calibrated sample (Human Ref RNA; Stratagene, La Jolla,
Calif).

Immunohistochemistry

The study initial cohort included a total of 188 chemonaive patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma, for
which formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples
were available.16,20 The immunohistochemical data had
been previously recorded separately for nucleotide excision repair protein ERCC1 and the phosphorylated forms
of MAPKs, including ERK, JNK, and p38. The present
analyses were limited to the subgroup of cases for which
ERCC1 and MAPK values were available. ERCC1
expression was categorized into high (positive expression)
and low levels (negative expression), and scores were
attributed to phosphorylated MAPK expression, using the
median as a cutoff point, as previously described.16,20 The
protocols for the immunostaining of the tumors samples
are shown in Table 1.
Statistical Analyses

Differences between subgroups were assessed using Fisher
exact test or the Mann-Whitney U test. The Kendall tau
statistic was used to measure the correlation between immunohistochemical variables. Differences between subgroups were assessed using Fisher exact test or the MannWhitney U test. The Kendall tau statistic was used to measure the correlation between immunohistochemical variables. The logistic regression model was developed with the
dichotomized levels of proteins to determine whether
ERCC1 expression was explained by the status of phosphorylated (p)ERK, pJNK, and pp38 after adjustment for
clinical or pathological variables linked to the smoking
status.16
The means of viable cell masses or ERCC1 relative
expression values were compared using 1-way or 2-way
analysis of variance, which was followed when appropriate
by Tukey-Kramer tests to compare 2 means, and by simple linear regression when the means were associated with
ordered variables, such as increasing concentrations of
siRNAs.
All tests were 2-sided, and a P value of <.05 was
considered statistically significant.

cases, 117 (62%) had a value for each protein (ERCC1,
pJNK, pERK, and pp38) and were included in the multivariate analysis. Patients who were included in the multivariate analysis (n ¼ 117) and validated cases based on
our population, (n ¼ 188) were comparable in terms of
demographic, clinical, and histological characteristics.
The median age at diagnosis of the included patients was
66 years (interquartile range, 51-72 years). Patients were
well balanced between men and women (58 of 59). The
majority of patients were smokers (84 of 117, 72%).
Examples of tissue immunostaining with phosphorylated p38 MAPK and ERCC1 antibodies are shown in
Figure 1A. The distribution of ERCC1-negative and

expression scores in tissues, is shown in Figure 1B. The

in multivariate models that were adjusted for the smoking
status and smoking status-related variables, including age,
sex, and histological subtype (Table 2).
These results suggest that ERCC1 expression might
depend on p38 MAPK signaling in lung cancer. Because
p38 MAPK signaling was generally higher in never smokers than in smokers, we selected 3 cancer cell lines (NCIH1975, NCI-H1793, NCI-H1651) from never smokers
and 1 cancer cell line (NCI-H1650) from a light smoker
(10 pack-years) for the following experiments.
Pharmacological Inhibition of p38 MAPK
Signaling and Cell Survival

p38 MAPK inhibition with the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB202190 (INH190), resulted in decreased viability of NCI-H1975, NCI-H1793, NCI-H1650, and
NCI-H1651 cell lines (referred to herein as H1975,

H1793, H1650, and H1651). The decrease in cell viability, expressed as a percentage of the control cell’s viability
(Fig. 3), was strong and significant (P < .01) for H1975
and H1650 (40% and 63%, respectively), and was modest
for H1793 (11%; P < .05) and H1651 (12%; not
significant).
Parallel experiments showed that cells were sensitive
to exposure to cisplatin at 20 lM, with the exception of
H1793 (decrease in cell viability of 24%, 7%, 48%, and
56% for H1975, H1793, H1650, and H1651, respectively). Cisplatin was only superior to SB202190 for
H1651.
When treatment with SB202190 was followed by
exposure to cisplatin, a significant decrease (P < .01) in
cell viability, compared with the control, was observed for
every cell line (52%, 29%, 76%, and 83% for H1975,
H1793, H1650, and H1651, respectively). The decrease
in cell viability using this drug combination significantly
exceeded (P < .01) the corresponding decrease in cell viability with cisplatin alone for H1793, H1650, and
H1651.

To verify the effect of SB202190 to target both MAPK14
and MAPK11, equimolar mixtures of siRNAs (sip38)
that targeted MAPK11 and MAPK14 mRNA isoforms
were used (Fig. 4). Although cells transfected with a
scrambled siRNA control at 50 nM did not show reduced
cell viability compared with cells treated with vehicle
alone, treatment with an equimolar mixture of sip38 at 5
nM was sufficient to significantly (P < .01) reduce cell viability in every cell line (12% for H1975, 43% for
H1793, and 42% for H1650 and H1651) compared with
the si control. Decreased expression of p38 protein after
the exposure of cell lines to p38 siRNAs was confirmed
in H1975, H1793, H1650, and H1651 cells by
Western blot.

At 25 nM of sip38 for H1793 and H1650, and at

of cisplatin was greater with 5 nM si11 compared with cisplatin plus the si control (P < .05); however, this response
plateaued at higher concentrations of si11 (decrease in cell
viability at 66%, 78%, 86%, and 85% at 0, 5, 25, and 50
nM si11, respectively).
si14 did not reduce the cell viability of H1975,
H1793, and H1650, whereas it significantly reduced (P <
.01) the cell viability of H1651 at 25 nM and at 50 nM
(45% and 44%, respectively). The sensitivity of H1650 to
cisplatin was significantly (P < .01) greater when cells
were pretreated with si14 at 5 nM compared with when
they were not pretreated, although the effect plateaued at
higher si14 concentrations (reduction in cell viability of
49%, 70%, 67%, and 68% at 0, 5, 25, and 50 nM si14,
respectively; P for the interaction ¼ .02).

H1975, H1793, H1651, and H1650 (A-D, respectively) cells were incubated with 20 lM SB202190 or without SB202190 (control
cells). Treated and control cells were grown without cisplatin. Cells were lysed for mRNA extraction at 24, 48, and 72 hours (H24,

H1793 and H1651, and at 48 hours for H1975 and
H1650 (Fig. 6).
The effects of si11 to target MAPK11 and si14 to
target MAPK14 on ERCC1 mRNA levels were also
recorded at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Transfection with si11
resulted in significantly decreased ERCC1 mRNA levels
for every cell line after 24 hours (H1651), or 48 hours
(H1975, H1793, H1650) depending on the cell line and
the siRNA concentration. The data for 25 nM and 50 nM
si11 are displayed in Figure 7 (data for 5 nM si11 are
available on request). The decrease occurred at 24 hours
after transfection with 50 nM si11, and at 48 hours with 5
nM and 25 nM si11 for H1651. It occurred at 48 hours
with 5 nM si11 for H1650, and with 25 nM si11 for
H1975 and H1793.
si14 had no significant effect on ERCC1 mRNA
expression for H1975 and H1793. However, a significant
decrease in ERCC1 mRNA levels occurred with 25 nM
si14 at 24 hours for H1651, and at 48 hours for H1650.
As a control experiment, transfection with siRNA
targeting ERCC1 (siERCC1) induced ERCC1 down-regulation in every cell line after 24 hours, which was maximal after 48 or 72 hours. The ERCC1 mRNA levels at 24
hours with siERCC1 were close to those recorded at the
same time as down-regulation with SB202190 for H1793
5022

and H1951, and with 50 nM of si11 for H1951. The
reduction in cell viability at 5 days after transfection,
which resulted in ERCC1 down-regulation, was similar to
that observed at the same time after transfection with si11
at 25 nM for H1975, H1793, and H1651, and with si11
at 5 nM for H1650.

DISCUSSION
The results of the present study provide evidence that p38
MAPK signaling can contribute positively to the viability
of lung cancer cells derived from never or light smokers.
The effect on cell viability was observed after pharmacological and genetic inhibition of p38 MAPK, although it
varied in magnitude with the type of inhibitor, its concentration, and the cell line. Although every cell line was sensitive to low concentrations of mixtures of siRNAs that
targeted both isoforms, the cell lines H1793 and H1651
were less sensitive to SB202190. Comparison between the
effects of cisplatin and p38 MAPK inhibition may be informative, as cisplatin was used at a concentration that
could discriminate between sensitive and resistant cell
lines. In most experiments, the effect of p38 MAPK inhibition was equal to or superior to that observed in cells
that were exposed to cisplatin alone. To our knowledge,

nM, or with siRNA to target ERCC1 at 50 nM (siERCC1), or with a negative siRNA control at 50 nM (si control). Transfected and
control cells with vehicle alone (control) were grown without cisplatin. Cells were lysed for mRNA extraction at 24, 48, and 72

this is the first report of the reliance of lung cancer cell survival on the p38 MAPK pathway.
SB202190 targets both MAPK11 and MAPK14.22
Interestingly, MAPK11 down-regulation reduced cell viability in every cell line, whereas a similar effect after
MAP14 down-regulation was only recorded for H1651,
suggesting that MAPK11 signaling is the main contributor to lung cancer cell survival in never smokers. Previous
studies have reported that MAPK11 and MAPK14 may
have opposite effects on cell differentiation, proliferation,
and survival. In cardiomyocytes, Jurkat cells, and HeLa
cells, MAPK14 induces apoptosis, whereas MAPK11
enhances survival.23-25 Other reports indicate that
MAPK14 can positively regulate proliferation and
enhance survival, for instance in hematopoietic cells and
several cancer cell lines.26 The effect of MAPK14 activity
seems to depend on cell-specific differences. Therefore,
the role of MAP14 or the interplay between the MAPK11
and MAPK14 isoforms in favoring survival of particular
lung cancer cells, such as H1651, should not be dismissed,
although it seems at variance with the tumor-suppressing
action that has been demonstrated for MAPK14 in mouse
models.14,27 The selectivity of the negative regulation of
Cancer

tumorigenesis may be an important aspect.28 MAPK14
antagonizes malignant transformations by N-Ras in fibroblasts or mutated K-RAS in colon cancer cells.29,30 The
proliferation of immature lung stem cells in MAPK14
knockout mice also facilitates K-RASG12V tumorigenesis.14 Of note, lung adenocarcinomas in patients who
have never smoked infrequently harbor K-RAS mutations,
which are common in smokers.31,32
Cisplatin is a major cytotoxic drug that is used to
treat lung cancer. However, not every patient with lung
cancer benefits from cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Interestingly, in 2 cell lines (H1793 and H1651), pretreatment
with SB202190 sensitized cells to cisplatin, that is, the
effect of their combination was superior to that of their
separate effects, indicating a synergy. As a result, the cisplatin-resistant cell line, H1793, became sensitive to cisplatin when pretreated with SB202190. In addition,
sensitivity to cisplatin was higher after MAPK11 downregulation of H1651, or after MAPK14 down-regulation
of H1650. These observations have potential clinical relevance, as current treatments for lung cancer with cytotoxic
drugs are only modestly efficacious. More studies are
needed to validate the combination of p38 MAPK

pathway inhibition and cisplatin, especially because in 2
other cell lines their combination has been inferior when
the drugs are used separately. However, our findings
should be validated by in vivo studies. Further efforts to
uncover the molecular alterations associated with p38
MAPK-mediated sensitization to cisplatin are warranted.
Some p38 inhibitor drugs are currently under clinical assessment, such as ARRY-614 from Array BioPharma
(Boulder, Colo; or ARRY-797, a potent inhibitor of p38a
enzyme), which is being currently tested in hematological
malignancies. In patients who are treated by surgery,
expression of the ERCC1 protein in tumor cells has been
shown to predict the benefit of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.18,19 We have reported that activated p38 MAPK
and ERCC1 are frequently expressed at high levels in lung
cancer in those who had never smoked, which was a reason for exploring the consequences of p38 MAPK inhibition for ERCC1 expression in lung cancer cell lines
derived from never smokers.16,20 Here, the additional
analysis showed that ERCC1 expression actually
depended on p38 MAPK activation state, independently
of smoking status. Although more frequent in tumors
from nonsmokers, activated p38 MAPK expression is not
specific to smoking status.
The ERCC1 gene contains AP-1 sites that are bound
by the transcription factors JUN and ATF2.33 In breast
cancer cells, Hayakawa et al reported that JNK was
required to activate the transcription of several DNA
damage repair genes, including ERCC1, ERCC3, MSH2,
XPA, and XPC, in response to cisplatin.34 In hepatocarcinoma cells, however, Andrieux et al reported that ERCC1
was up-regulated during proliferative signals in response
to stimulation with epidermal growth factor, which
involved ERK activity and binding of the transcription
factor GATA-1.35 We examined whether ERCC1 expression could be down-regulated by inhibiting MAPK p38
signaling. Our results suggest that ERCC1 mRNA levels
can be regulated by p38 MAPK, notably by MAPK11 in
cells from never or light smokers. However, we could not
demonstrate clear modifications in ERCC1 protein levels.
Furthermore, down-regulation of ERCC1 mRNA expression with ERCC1-specific siRNA was sufficient to reduce
cell viability. Thus, down-regulation of ERCC1 expression may account, in part, for the effect of p38 MAPK inhibition on cell viability. Crosstalk between p38 and JNK
pathways should be considered, as both MAPK pathways
share several upstream regulators, and multiple stimuli
simultaneously activate both pathways. The mechanistic
basis of the relation between p38 MAPK signaling and
sensitivity to cisplatin remains unknown.
5024

In conclusion, the results of our study support the
hypothesis that lung cancer cells derived from never or
light smokers rely on p38 MAPK signaling for their survival. Inhibition of p38 MAPK can also synergize with cisplatin in different models and results in decreased ERCC1
mRNA expression. These findings highlight the potential
of focused analysis of the cellular and molecular characteristics of lung cancers in nonsmokers to uncover new therapies for lung cancer.
