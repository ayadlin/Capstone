ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most lethal of brain cancer, and it comprises
a heterogeneous mixture of functionally distinct cancer cells that affect tumor
progression. We examined the U87, U251, and U373 malignant cell lines as in vitro
models to determine the impact of cellular cross-talk on their phenotypic alterations
in co-cultures. These cells were also studied at the transcriptome level, to define
the mechanisms of their observed mutually affected genomic stability, proliferation,
invasion and resistance to temozolomide. This is the first direct demonstration of the
neural and mesenchymal molecular fingerprints of U87 and U373 cells, respectively.
U87-cell conditioned medium lowered the genomic stability of U373 (U251) cells,
without affecting cell proliferation. In contrast, upon exposure of U87 cells to U373
(U251) conditioned medium, U87 cells showed increased genomic stability, decreased
proliferation rates and increased invasion, due to a plethora of produced cytokines
identified in the co-culture media. This cross talk altered the expression 264 genes
in U87 cells that are associated with proliferation, inflammation, migration, and
adhesion, and 221 genes in U373 cells that are associated with apoptosis, the cell
cycle, cell differentiation and migration. Indirect and direct co-culturing of U87
and U373 cells showed mutually opposite effects on temozolomide resistance. In
conclusion, definition of transcriptional alterations of distinct glioblastoma cells
upon co-culturing provides better understanding of the mechanisms of glioblastoma
heterogeneity, which will provide the basis for more informed glioma treatment in
the future.

tumor heterogeneity at the cellular and genetic levels is
mandatory.
Gene expression signatures were believed to more
accurately predict for the outcome of GBM patients than
histology alone [3]. Hence GBM were classified based
on their gene expression patterns, somatic mutations, and
DNA copy numbers as the proneural, neural, classical
and mesenchymal subtypes [4]. However, these subtypes

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal
of all of the brain tumors, because of its single-cell
infiltration into normal brain parenchyma and its local
recurrence. The median survival of patients with GBM
remains low, at 15 to 16 months, despite the development
of novel therapeutic modalities [1]. As stated by
Stieber et al. [2], to advance personalized treatment and
improve clinical outcomes, un understanding of intrawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

arisen through next generation sequencing analyses [5,
6] have still failed to sufficiently stratify patients and to
successfully predict their responses to therapy, due to
intra-tumor heterogeneity [7, 8].
Similar to other tumors, GBM contain heterogeneous
regions of cells that are highly proliferative or invasive,
with apoptotic and necrotic areas, as well as regions of
intensive angiogenesis [9]. This is due to the clonal
diversity within GBM, as has been confirmed by gene
expression profiling [10], FISH analysis, and comparative
genomic hybridization [11, 2]. According to ploidy, GBM
were recently sub-classified as mono-genomic or polygenomic tumors, with the former consisting of a pseudodiploid tumor cell clone admixed with normal stromal
cells, and the latter consisting of multiple tumor cell
clones mixed with pseudo-diploid cells [2]. Moreover,
epigenetic changes such as the O6-methylguanine DNA
methyltransferase (Mgmt) gene methylation patterning,
have been shown to modulate responses to temozolomide
in GBM [12]. It is thus clear that the overall combined
“omics” results from the analysis of this tumor tissue
cannot reliably explain the complex cellular processes
within the GBM tumor mass [13].
Different GBM subtypes might reflect different
histological origins of GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) [14].
Genetically divergent GBM cell populations might have
evolved from GSCs of different origins that expressed
variable patterns of stem-cell markers, such as CD133,
CD15, A2B5, and CD44, due to which they might harbor
different tumorigenic potential [2]. The heterogeneity of a
GBM might also arise from differences in differentiation
of the progenitors into the tumor cells under the pressure
of the tumor microenvironment, containing endothelial,
immune, and normal stem cells of mesenchymal and
hematopoietic origins [3]. Different tumor cell populations
might thus not be just inert bystanders; rather their
interactions with the tumor microenvironment and among
themselves might have an impact on the tumor growth and
its drug resistance.
Increasing numbers of studies are addressing the
intra-tumor heterogeneity, through investigations into the
interactions among various cancer cells. However, they
rarely address this at the molecular interactome level,
which might provide the best information regarding the
impact of tumor heterogeneity on tumor growth and
invasion, and on the prediction of treatment response.
Here, we used DNA microarrays to study the interactions
between genotypically and phenotypically distinct GBM
cell lines, and to investigate their impact on cellular
processes in direct and indirect co-cultures in vitro. As
the in vitro cellular models, we selected phenotypically
distinct cell lines that are often used as cell models to
study GBM: the rapidly proliferating U87 GBM cells;
and slowly proliferating U251 and U373 GBM cells. We
report that the U87 and U373 cells differ significantly in
their gene expression fingerprints and express phenotypes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that resemble the neuronal and mesenchymal characters,
respectively. Similarly, neuronal and mesenchymal
phenotypes were ascribed to GSCs by Denysenko [8].
Here, we are also reporting on cellular processes, such
as cell proliferation, colony forming, invasion, and
chromosomal instability, and on the resistance of these
cells to the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), which
was dysregulated in these co-cultured GBM cells. We
have associated these processes with their respective
transcriptomic changes in indirect co-cultures. To our
knowledge, this is the first in-depth analysis of interactions
between distinct GBM cell lines, and we show that GBM
clones within a tumor mass do not just co-exist, but rather
they cooperate with each other.

RESULTS
Established GBM cell lines show different
growth dynamics, cytokine expression and
morphology
U87, U251 and U373 GBM cells were initially
assayed for their proliferation under increased serum
conditions (Figure 1a), and for their cytokine expression
(Figure 1b). U87 cells showed superior growth to U251
and U373 cells, as they were more proliferative, when
grown under serum-deprived, normal (10% fetal bovine
serum [FBS]), and serum enriched conditions (Figure 1a).
High serum (i.e. 20%) inhibited the growth of all three of
these cell lines. Of the 79 cytokines measured, granulocyte
colony stimulating factor (GSCF), interleukin 6 (IL6),
chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), leukemia inhibitory factor
(LIF) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)
appeared to be differentially secreted from U87 and U373
cells (Figure 1b). Consistent with their proliferative and
secretory differences, different morphologies of these
GBM cell lines were noted (Figure 2b–2d). The rapidly
growing U87 cells appear morphologically distinct (Figure
2b) from the slowly growing U251 and U373 cells (Figure
2c, 2d). Both U251 and U373 cells had a mesenchymallike morphology, whereas U87 cells with their long thin
protrusions resembled a neuronal morphology.

Established cell lines differ in their stem-like cell
characteristics
Different glioma clones isolated from the same
GBM have previously been shown to have different
tumorigenic potential that correlated with their GSC
content. We therefore determined the cell-surface
expression of the prominin 1/CD133 antigen in U87, U251
and U373 cells, as compared to the positive control GSC
spheroids of the NCH644 cell line (Figure 2a–2h). The
percentage of CD133+ cells varied across all three of these
GBM cell lines, with U87 cells showing the highest levels
(0.33%) and U373 the lowest levels (0.20%) of CD133+

cells (Figure 2e–2h). The potential for self-renewal of
these tumor cells was measured according to their numbers
of colony forming units (CFU), whereby U87 cells showed
lower CFU compared to U373 cells (Figure 2i). As GBM
cells use paracrine signals for their cellular cross-talk, the
impact of U87 cell conditioned media (CM) on the CFU
of U373 and U251 cells, and vice versa, were analyzed.
CFU formation of all of these cell lines was increased in
cultures with CM (Figure 2i). U87 cells exposed to U373
CM showed an almost doubling of their CFU, whereas
with the slow-growing U373 cells there was only a 30%
increase in CFU upon exposure to U87 CM. The presumed
neuronal and mesenchymal characters of these cells
mirrored in the appearance of their colonies, with U87
cells forming relatively loose colonies, compared to the
U251 and U373 cells, which both formed compact and
evenly rounded colonies (Figure 2j–2l).

in U87 CM nor their indirect co-culturing with U87 cells
evoked any changes in their cell proliferation.

Invasion potential of GBM cells changes
in the co-cultures
The impact of paracrine mediators on cell invasion
was tested by using the 2D-Boyden chamber assay
(indirect co-cultures, CM cultures) and the 3D-spheroid
collagen embedding assay (CM cultures). There was
decreased cell invasion of U87 cells in the indirect cocultures with U251 and U373 cells, whereas again there
were no changes in U251 and U373 cell invasion (Figure
3c). The same was observed in the 2D-Boyden chamber
CM cultures (data not shown). Contrary to the indirect
co-cultures and the CM cultures in the 2D set up of the
Boyden chambers, invasion of all of the cell lines in the
3D set-up (collagen embedded spheroids exposed to
CM) was increased (compare Figure 3c and Figure 3d).
This might first be due to the different matrices used,
i.e. matrigel versus collagen in the 2D and the 3D set
ups, respectively, which might have affected both the
adhesion and invasion of the cells. Secondly, the multicellular structure of the 3D spheroids (with the mediators
secreted by the inner cells), might have influenced U87
cells differently, and enabled them to override the effects
of the paracrine mediators present in the CM of U251 and
U373 cells. As differences in the relative invasion were
observed between the control U87 and U373 cells, with
the relative invasion of the control U87 cells higher on day
1 and lower on day 5 (Figure 3d–3f) when compared to the
control U373 cells, this would imply on direct homotypic

Proliferation of GBM cells changes in the cocultures
The proliferation potential of GBM cells was
measured by Ki67 immuno-staining, which demonstrated
that U87 cells proliferated significantly faster than
U373 cells (Figure 3a, 3b), which was consistent with
the results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays (Figure
1a). The proliferation of U87 cells was decreased by
> 50%, when they were cultured either with the U251/
U373 CM or were indirectly co-cultured with the slowgrowing GBM cells (i.e. U251, U373 cells) (Figure 3a,
3b). However, for 251 and U373 cells, neither their growth

of micronuclei (MN), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and
nucleated buds (BUDs) in bi-nucleated cells (Figure 4a)
of the normally proliferating cells (Figure 4b–4c). U87
cells showed lower numbers of MN, NPBs, and BUDs
compared to both of the slow-growing U251 and U373
cell lines. Between these latter two cell lines, U251 cells
showed the highest numbers of MN, NPBs and BUDs
(Figure 4a).
When exposing these GBM cells to the CM of
the other cell type(s), the number of MN in U87 cells
decreased with exposure to U373 CM, whereas the
number of MN in U373 cells increased with exposure to
U87 CM (Figure 4d). This decrease in the chromosomal
instability in U87 cells correlated with the demonstrated

Genomic stability of GBM cell lines correlates
with their growth
To determine whether the genomic instability
that can lead to the evolution of aneuploid cells is
affected by the paracrine GBM cell-cell interactions, we
performed the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome
assay with U87, U251, and U373 cells exposed to CM

Sensitivity of GBM cells to temozolomide
changes between indirect and direct co-cultures

inhibition of proliferation of these U87 cells by U373
CM (compare Figure 3a with Figure 4d). U87 CM also
increased the number of apoptotic cells in both U251
and U373 cells, whereas no such effect was noted in U87
cells exposed to U251 CM or U373 CM (Figure 4e). This
implies that U87 cells have a higher apoptotic threshold
compared to U251 and U373 cells. Consistent with this,
the Bax (Bcl-2 associated X protein)/ Bcl2 (B-cell CLL/
lymphoma 2) ratio was decreased in U87 cells exposed
to U373 CM (Figure 4f). Conversely, and although not
significant, there was an increase in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio
in U251 and U373 cells exposed to U87 CM. Together,
these data imply that U251 CM and U373 CM act towards
increased genomic stability of U87 cells, whereas U87
CM might have opposite effects; i.e., it might decrease
genomic stability of U251 and U373 cells, and enhance
their apoptotic tendency.

Different clones within a GBM might acquire
different resistances against chemotherapy. Apart from
mutations known to change cellular resistance, our aim
was to measure the effects of co-culturing different
GBM cells on their resistance to TMZ over 72 h. The
sensitivities of U87, U251, and U373 cells to TMZ were
analyzed by measuring cell viability with the MTT assay
(Figure 5a–5c). The highest viability decrease (20%) was
observed for U87 cells at the highest TMZ concentrations.
Lower viability decreases for U251 and U373 cells
exposed to TMZ are consistent with their slow growth and
imply their higher intrinsic resistance to TMZ, compared
to U87 cells (compare Figure 5a with Figure 5b–5c). That
is consistent with the cell-cycle analyses of U87 and U373

cells exposed to TMZ (Figure 5d, compare the 4th columns
of each dataset), where fewer U87 cells in G1/S phase
were noted, when compared to U373 cells.
Moreover, in the indirect co-cultures of U87 and
U373 cells after TMZ treatment, more U87 cells remained
in G1/S phase, when compared to treated mono-cultured
U87 cells. In co-cultured U373 cells, the inverse response
was noted (Figure 5d, compare 4th and 5th columns of
each dataset for both cell lines). This suggested that in the
indirect co-cultures of U87 and U373 cells, the resistance
of U87 cells to TMZ increased, whereas it decreased for
U373 cells.
To determine whether these co-culture effects might
influence the cellular composition of the direct co-cultures
upon TMZ treatment, direct co-cultures of U87 and U373eGFP cells were set up at different ratios (Figure 5e).
These were then evaluated by flow cytometry (Figure
5f–5h) after 72 h exposure to TMZ, and for the control
(dimethylsulfoxide; DMSO). U87 cells decreased their
proliferation rates in direct co-cultures with U373-eGFP
cells at all of the ratios tested. Conversely, U373-eGFP
cells increased their proliferation rates in direct co-cultures
with U87 cells, which is consistent with the previous
proliferation measures (compare Figure 5 with Figure
3a–3b). As in the cell cycle analysis, TMZ increased
the proliferation rates of U87 cells in direct co-culture,
whereas it decreased the proliferation rates of U373 cells,
when compared to non-treated directly co-cultured cells
(Figure 5f–5h). This was most evident for 1:1 direct coculture (Figure 5g), which again implies that U87 cells
sensitize U373 cells to TMZ, and U373 cells protect U87
cells from TMZ toxicity, a concept that was also observed
in the indirect co-cultures (Figure 5d).
Taken together, we have demonstrated that this
cellular cross-talk has an impact on the resistance of
co-cultured cells in vitro, and we speculate that similar
interactions between different clones that co-exist in a
GBM in vivo might likewise influence the overall tumor
therapy response for alkylating agents.

GO terms in the Process (regulation of cell differentiation,
extracellular matrix organization), Molecular Function
(transmembrane receptor signaling receptor activity)
and Cellular Component (extracellular space, clathrincoated endocytotic vesicle membrane) domains as further
features in which U373 cells differ from U87 cells. These
appear consistent with the neuronal and mesenchymal
phenotypes, that were initially ascribed to these U87 and
U373 cells, respectively, in the above analyses.

Alterations in gene expression of co-cultured U87
and U373 cells support their phenotype changes
Comparative transcriptomics analyses revealed
differences between monocultured and indirectly cocultured U87 and U373 cells in terms of their differentially
expressed genes (Supplementary Tables S2, S3). U87
cells grown in indirect co-culture with U373 cells showed
significantly changed expression of 264 genes (p-value
< 0.01), compared to U373 cells, where 221 genes were
differentially expressed (p-value < 0.01) in co-culture.
This indicates that both cell types have an effect on
each other when in the co-culture. This became more
evident when high stringency criteria were applied (FC
> 1, adj. p-value < 0.01) [15], which generated only 21
differentially expressed genes in co-cultured U87 cells
(Table 1), and 60 differentially expressed genes in cocultured U373 cells (Table 2). The deregulation of Ccl20
(Chemokine C-C motif ligand 20), Dpp4 (Dipeptidylpeptidase 4) and Egflam (EGF-like, fibronectin type
III and laminin G domains) gene expression in cocultured U87 cells observed in the cDNA microarrays
was validated by qRT-PCR. In U87 cells, it confirmed
two-fold increases in Ccl20 and Dpp4 expression, and
two-fold decrease in Egflam expression, whereas their
expression did not change significantly in co-cultured
U373 cells (Supplementary Figure S2.a–S2.c). The qRTPCR results for Ccl20, Dpp4 and Eglfam in co-cultured
U87 cells were in agreement with the log2FC obtained
from the cDNA microarray data analysis. Moreover, the
most deregulated genes in indirectly co-cultured U87 cells
included those involved in proliferation and inflammation
(Gpr86, Dact1, Rgs2, Dpp4, Fap, Edn1, Il1A), migration
and adhesion (Csf2, F3, Ccl20, C1QTnf5, Cpa6, Egflam,
Plod 2, Fgd3, Hhex). In contrast in co-cultured U373 cells,
the genes that were identified as differentially expressed
were mainly associated with apoptosis and the cell cycle
(Fosl1, Txnip, Btg2, Rgcc, Efhd1, Ier3, Tnaip3, Myc),
or cell differentiation (Csf2, Gdf15, Il1B, Maff, Dlx5,
Krt8) and migration (Il8, Cxcl2, Ccl2, Ca12, Fgr, Gper,
Eps8L1). These co-culture gene expression data are in
line with the observed differences in cellular responses
relating to the proliferative and invasive behaviors in the
co-cultured cells, where down-regulation of migration
and adhesion genes is consistent with the decreased
invasion observed in U87 cells exposed to U373 CM.
Likewise, increased expression of differentiation genes

Transcriptomic analysis supports neuronal and
mesenchymal phenotypes of U87 and U373 cells,
respectively
Although both U87 cells and U373 cells were
derived from primary human GBM, they differ in their
gene expression patterns (Supplementary Table S1,
p-value < 0.01). Comparative gene expression analysis
[15] of U87 and U373 cells revealed that they differ in
the expression of 5275genes (absolute logFC > 1, adj. pvalue < 0.01). U373 cells showed increased expression
of surface markers associated with mesenchymal stem
cells, i.e. CD29 (integrin b1/fibronectin receptor), CD90
(Thy-1 cell surface antigen) and CD105 (endoglin,
TGF-b receptor), when compared to U87 cells. The Gene

to U87 cell gene expression.

explain their decreased proliferative index, as well as their

best representatives. However we agree with Li et al.
[18], who showed that there are discrete features of GBM
tumors that are conserved in the established cell lines,
and that by defining the divergence of the established cell
lines from the original tumor type, they concluded that
the established GBM cell lines can nonetheless serve as
clinically relevant glioma models for a given aim and
experimental design.
Although, previous transcriptomics analyses classified
GBMs into four subtypes, [4, 14, 19], Denysenko and coworkers [8] demonstrated that GSCs, derived from primary
GBM, belong either to a readily growing neuronal type of
cells with prevailing expression of neuronal development
genes [4] or to a slowly proliferating mesenchymal type
of cells with gene expression patterns underlying their
extracellular matrix synthesis/degradation activity [4].
Recently, a proneural-to-mesenchymal shift in gene
expression patterns was shown to occur in subpopulations of
GBM cells as a response to radiation [20]. The acquisition
of the mesenchymal phenotype not only enhanced cellular
resistance to radiation, but also increased the invasiveness
of the cells with the mesenchymal phenotype [8, 20, 21].
The known U87 and U373 cells appear to behave as
characterized cells of neuronal and mesenchymal types
respectively. They differ in their expression of genes

DISCUSSION
Knowledge of intra-tumor heterogeneity at the
genetic, cellular and functional levels is crucial for an
understanding of GBM resistance to treatment, and thus
for improvements in GBM therapies [2, 17]. Although
Steiber et al. [2] confirmed the existence of GBM cell
heterogeneity in vivo, through a systematic study of the
transcriptomic and genomic profiles of sorted primary
GBM cells, to the best of our knowledge, to date, the intratumoral interactions among different GBM clones have
not been studied at the molecular level. Here, we used the
established U87, U251, and U373 GBM cell lines as our
in vitro cellular models, to identify de-regulated genes and
the underlying phenotypic changes observed in indirectly
and directly co-cultured U87 and U373 cells, including
their responses to frequently used alkylating drug TMZ.
We are aware that established cell lines differ in their
gene expression signatures and ploidy from the primary
GBM clones in vivo [2], and as such might not be their

associated with developmental processes, cell differentiation
and extracellular matrix organization (Figure 6). Such a
distinction between two subtypes of GBM had already
been suggested [4]. Thus, we believe that the interactions
between these U87 and U373 (and similarly for U251)
model GBM cell lines might well mirror these two GBM
subtypes in vivo.
Clonal evolution of tumors is driven by the genomic
instability of tumor-initiating cells, which results in a
plasticity of GSCs and their malignant progenitors [22]
that is also reflected in the established tumor cell lines
[17]. Intercellular cross-talk might either accelerate or
counteract the genetic stability. We observed that higher
genetic instability was reflected in more numerous MN,
NPBs and BUDs in U251 and U373 cells versus U87
cells. The number of MN increased in U373 cells upon
exposure to U87 CM, whereas U251/U373 CM cells had
the opposite effect on U87 cells. This is consistent with
the anti-proliferative effect that U373 cells have on U87
cells. Similar correlations between increased MN and
proliferation were observed in pediatric SF188 GBM
cells [23]. Also, paracrine and direct interactions between
U87 and U373 cells resulted in decreased proliferation
of U87 cells, whereas proliferation of co-cultured U373
cells was not affected. Consistent with this, in co-cultured
U87 cells there was up-regulation of the genes Gpr84
(G-protein coupled receptor 84), Dact1 (Dishevelledbinding antagonist of beta-catenin 1) and Rgs2 (Regulator
of G-protein signalling 2). Expression of Gpr84 is known
to be enhanced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α and IL-1
[24], both of which also increased in co-cultured U373
cells. These two cytokines might up-regulate Gpr84
in U87 cells and decrease their proliferation, similar to
retinal cells [25]. Next, increased expression of Dact1
is known to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells
through inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling [26], while
increased expression of Rgs2 is known to suppress growth
of MCF7 and HEK293T breast carcinoma cells [27]. In
contrast, neither proliferation changes nor deregulation
of the above-mentioned genes were noted in co-cultured
U373 cells. This demonstrates that some cellular responses
might indeed be GBM cell-subtype dependent.
The increased number of cells with apoptotic
morphology among U373 cells exposed to U87 CM
implied their increased apoptosis. In contrast, decreased
numbers of MN and decreased Bax/Bcl-2 ratios in U87
cells exposed to U251/U373 CM indicate a higher
apoptotic threshold of U87 cells. Consistent with this,
we noted altered expression of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic genes in both U87 and U373 cells. Up-regulation
of the Ptgs2 (Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase
2) and Fap (Fibroblast activation protein, alpha); and
down-regulation of Hhex (Hematopoietically expressed
homeobox) gene in co-cultured U87 cells might have
protected these from apoptosis. Namely, Ptgs2 inhibits
apoptosis in glioma xenografts [28], while Fap overwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression increases astrocytoma resistance to FASmediated apoptosis [29]. Moreover Hhex down-regulation,
coinciding with down-regulation of Bcl-2 [30], might
explain the higher apoptotic threshold of co-cultured U87
cells. In contrast, expression of the Ier3 (Immediate early
response 3) gene, which enhances apoptosis in radiated
glioma cells via NFkB, MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt
signaling [31], was increased in co-cultured U373 cells.
The different responses of U87 and U373 cells
initiated by their paracrine interaction might be explained
by their differences in expression of the tumor suppressor
gene p53. The transcription factor P53 is a known
regulator of genes involved in the cell cycle, genetic
instability, proliferation, and apoptosis [32]. The wild type
p53 status of U87 cells [33] might underlie the observed
decrease in proliferation of U87 cells exposed to U251/
U373 CM. Their active P53 might have induced cell-cycle
arrest and DNA damage repair, which would be reflected
in decreased numbers of MN and increased apoptotic
threshold in these exposed U87 cells. On the other hand,
the mutated p53 gene status in U373 cells [33] might
underlie the increased genomic instability and apoptosis
in U373 cells exposed to U87 CM. The up-regulation of
G0s2 (G0/G1 switch 2) expression seen in co-cultured
U373 cells might have increased the apoptotic morphology
of co-cultured U373 cells, as when G0s2 interacts with
BCL-2, it promotes apoptosis by preventing formation of
the BAX/BCL-2 hetero-dimer [34].
These apoptotic threshold alterations might result
in changed sensitivity of the GBM cells to TMZ, a DNA
alkylating agent that is known to impair GBM cell growth
and increase survival of patients from 6 months up to 1
year. However, this only relates to GBM patients with
inactive (methylated) MGMT [12], as active MGMT can
correct for TMZ-induced DNA damage. The U87, U251,
and U373 cell lines are known to have a methylated MGMT
promoter and have been described as TMZ sensitive [35,
36]. We demonstrated that the neuronal-like U87 cells
are more resistant to TMZ than the mesenchymal-like
U373 cells after 24 h at low concentrations of TMZ,
which parallels the resistance of the same phenotypes
of GSCs reported by Denysenko et al. [8]. The TMZ
resistance of U87 and U373 cells changed in their (in)
direct co-cultures versus monocultures, possibly due to
their altered proliferation, as proliferative cells are more
sensitive to cytotoxic agents [17]. These data suggest
that mesenchymal-like U373 cells protect neuronal-like
U87 cells from TMZ cytotoxicity, and conversely, U87
cells appear to sensitize U373 cells to TMZ. Similarly,
the in vivo cross-talk between different co-existing clones
within a GBM might underlie the differential tumor therapy
responses observed. In agreement with the above, we
observed increased expression of the Ptgs2 and Egr2 (Early
growth response 2) genes in co-cultured U87 cells. These
reportedly promote resistance of lung cancer cells to cisplatinum [37] and colon cancer cells to 5′-fluorouracil [38].

and their co-cultures provide reliable in vitro models, as
these resemble the in vivo intra-tumor interactions of the
heterogeneous tumors that contain mixed cell phenotypes.
Thus, these in vitro models are particularly useful for
evaluation of drug response. The molecular markers that
were shown here to be up-regulated in our transcriptomic
and cytokine analyses can now be further studied and used
in anti-proliferative and anti-invasive therapeutic designs
for GBM treatments.

Gene expression changes observed in co-cultured
U87 and U373 cells resulted in altered invasiveness
of these GBM cells. Contrary to increased invasion of
U373 cells observed in both the 2D and 3D invasion
assays, invasion of U87 cells appeared to be highly
dependent on the matrix substrate and spatial set-up.
When exposed to U373 CM, U87 cell invasion decreased
in the indirect 2D co-cultures using matrigel, whereas it
increased in the 3D-collagen-embedded U87 spheroids.
As effects of similar matrices on gene expression have
been reported previously [39], the decreased migration
of U87 cells in indirect co-culture with U373 cells might
result from increased expression of the C1qTnf5 (C1q
and tumor necrosis factor related protein 5) gene, which
enhances adhesion of retinal epithelial cells [40], and
decreased expression of the Plod2 (Procollagen-lysine,
2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2) gene, which inhibits
sarcoma cell migration [39]. On the other hand, increased
invasion of U87 cells from spheroids in the 3D-collagenembedding CM cultures might be ascribed to increases in
the expression of the Ccl20 (Chemokine C-C motif ligand
20) and Csf2 (Colony stimulating factor 2) genes, and a
decrease in the expression of the Fgd3 (FYVE, RhoGEF
and PH domain containing 3) gene. Namely, Ccl20 and
Csf2 are both up-regulated in GBM in vivo, and even
correlate with shorter patient survival [41, 42]. Knockdown of Csf2 expression also reduces invasion of GL261
cells in vivo [41].
With the respect to GBM cell invasion, which is
known to be of mesenchymal type and to involve the
formation of cellular protrusions, or invadopodia [43],
some of the associated genes were also up-regulated
and down-regulated in co-cultured GBM cells.
Decreased Fgd3 gene expression is known to increase
migration of HeLa cells [44], and this might account
for the increased invasiveness of U87 cells exposed to
U373 CM. In U373 cells co-cultured with U87 cells,
the expression of Csf-2, IL8 (Interleukin 8) and IL6
(interleukin 6) increased, which is known to increase
MCF-7 cell migration [45]. The increased invasion of
U373 cells might also be due to decreased expression
of the Btg2 (BTG family member 2) and Vav3 (Vav 3
guanine nucleotide exchange factor) genes, which might
account for the pro-invasive morphology of U373 cells,
through the release of Btg2 and Vav3 inhibitory effects
on invadopodium formation [46, 47]. Taken together,
we speculate that the cross-talk between U87 and U373
cells is responsible for their increased invasion in the
3D spheroid assay, which is possibly mediated by their
paracrine and autocrine signals.
In summary, we have demonstrated that GBM cells
of distinct phenotypes and p53 gene status can indeed
significantly impact upon each other’s phenotype in vitro,
as shown by their altered proliferation, invasive behavior,
and TMZ resistance. This study also provides evidence
that the established U87, U251, and U373 GBM cell lines

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and conditioned media collection
The U87, U251 and U373 human GBM cell lines
(from ATCC , Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma USA)
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, USA), 100
U penicillin, 1000 U streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine,
Na-pyruvate and non-essential amino acids, and they
were plated at a density of 15 000 cells/cm2. This growth
medium was also used as the control medium in the direct
and indirect co-culturing experiments. U373-eGFP cells
were cultured in the growth medium with 1 mg/mL of
geneticin (Sigma, USA). NCH644 cells were grown in
neurobasal (NBE) medium (Gibco, Life Tech Corp.,
UK) with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U penicillin, 1000
U streptomycin (all PAA Laboratories, Austria), B-27
(Gibco, UK), 1 U/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany),
20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) in 20 ng/ml
β-fibroblast growth factor (Gibco, UK), and seeded at
1 × 105 cells/ml. All of the cell lines underwent DNA
fingerprint short tandem repeat analysis to confirm their
identity [48, 49, 50].
Conditioned media (CM) were obtained by
conditioning the growth media for 24 h with the specified
confluent cells immediately prior to passaging. CM were
centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min and mixed with fresh
growth medium at a 1:1 ratio prior to use.

Colony formation assay
Five hundred cells of each cell type were seeded
onto 100-mm dishes in duplicates with control or CM of
the relevant cell type added. The medium was changed
every 5 days. On day 14, colonies containing > 30 cells
were counted following staining with 0.4% Giemsa
dye (Sigma, USA). As a control medium, a medium
conditioned by the non-tumorigenic, normal bone marrowderived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was also used.
For collecting the MSC-CM, the MSCs (male, 33,
6F4085; Lonza Bioscience, Wakersville Inc.) were grown
in the above mentioned growth medium for 24 h, prior to
passaging. No significant increases of the CFU ability of
the GBM cells were noted when these were exposed to
MSC CM (Supplementary Figure S3).

well added. Similarly, CM was added to the cover slips
for the CM culture set-up. After 72 h, the cells were fixed
with 70% methanol for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton-X for 10 min, and left in 4% bovine serum albumin
for 15 min. These were incubated with the primary mouse
anti-Ki67 antibody (1:100 dilution, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) for 1 h, and then with the secondary anti-mouse
Alexa-Fluor 488 labeled antibody (1:1500 dilution,
Molecular Probes, Paisley, UK), together with Hoechst
(5 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 90 min. The cover
slips were then mounted with Antifade reagent (Life
Technologies, USA), and the ratios between the Ki67stained nuclei and the total nuclei (Hoechst staining) were
scored for each experiment in at least 500 cells.

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (6000 cells/
well). After 24 h and a wash with phosphate-bufferedsaline (PBS), the growth media containing 0%, 1%, 10%
and 20% FBS were added to the wells as five replicates.
After 48 h, the MTT reagent [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide; Sigma, USA]
was added. After 3 h incubation, the formazan crystals
were dissolved in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma,
USA) and the absorbance was measured as the change
in optical density (ΔOD 570/690 nm) using microplate
reader (Synergy™ HT, Bio-Tec Instruments Inc., USA).
To determine TMZ cytotoxicity with MTT, attached cells
were treated with media containing 7.5, 75, 150 and 750
μM TMZ for 24, 48 and 72 h. DMSO was used as the Kt
control.

Cell-cycle analysis of indirectly co-cultured U87
and U373 cells
The indirect co-cultures were set-up in duplicate
using 6-well Transwell inserts (Costar, Corning
Incorporated, NY, USA) with 0.4 μm pore size. On the
bottom of the well, 105 U87 cells were plated in 2 ml,
whereas 105 U373 cells were plated into the insert in 1
ml. Cells were left to adhere before being put together and
the growth medium with or without temozolomide (TMZ;
750 μM) added. Upon 72 h, the cells were harvested, fixed
with 75% ethanol, washed with PBS and resuspended
in 0.5 ml propidium iodide/RNase staining buffer (BD
Pharmingen, USA). The cell cycle analysis was performed
by FACS analysis (BD FACSCalibur™; BD Biosciences,
USA) using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences,
USA). The WinMDI and Cyclored software were used to
analyze the distributions of the cell populations across the
different phases of the cell cycle.

Detection of cytokine release
Fresh growth medium and media conditioned for
72 h by U87 and U373 cells were used to determine
the cytokine expression using RayBio Human Cytokine
Antibody Array (Ray Biotech Inc., USA), according to
the manufacturer protocol. Cytokine signals were detected
by chemiluminescence produced with ECL-Plus Western
blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences, UK)
and a 1-min exposure to X-ray film.

CD133 marker detection by flow cytometry
Cells were harvested (1 × 106), washed with PBS
and incubated with 10 μL CD133-PE antibody (clone
293C3; Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, USA), which recognizes
epitope 2 of the human CD133 antigen (CD133/2) and 20
μl isotype control (PE-IgG2b, BD Biosciences, USA), as
indicated by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences, USA).
Propidium iodide was added to the cell samples for
accurate live-cell analysis. The cells were incubated for
20 min, washed and subjected to fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) analysis (BD FACSCalibur™, BD
Biosciences, USA) using the CellQuest Software (BD
Biosciences, USA), to determine the percentages of viable
CD133+ cells.

Proliferation of directly co-cultured U87 and
U373-eGFP cells
Direct co-cultures of U87 and U373-eGFP cells
were set-up in 6-well plates, into which the cells were
seeded at the total density of 105 cells/ 3ml as five different
ratios: 1:0, 1:3, 1:1, 3:1, and 0:1. The growth medium was
changed the next day for the growth medium containing
TMZ at the final concentration of 750 μM, with growth
medium containing 0.5% DMSO as the TMZ control.
After 72 h, the cells were trypsinized and the viable
(attached) cells ratio determined by FACS analysis
(BD FACSCalibur™; BD Biosciences, USA) using the
CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, USA).

Proliferation assay using an anti-Ki67 antibody
The proliferation of indirectly co-cultured cells
was determined using 24-well Transwell inserts (Costar,
Cornig Inc, NY) with 0.4 μm pore size. Here, 5000 cells
were plated in a 50μl drop on poly-L-lysine coated (20
ng/ml, Sigma) cover slips. The co-cultured cells of the
relevant other cell type were plated onto the membrane
of the insert at a density of 10000 cells /200 μl and left
to attach for 2 h. There were then put above the cover
slip into 24-well plates, with 800 μl growth medium/

Cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay
U87, U251 and U373 cells were seeded into T25
flasks (Corning, NY, USA) at 450 000 cells/flask. The next
day, the medium was changed and the cells were exposed
to CM of the relevant cell type for 72 h, with cytochalasin

B (2 μg/ml) added to the cells after 48 h. After 72 h, the
medium was collected separately for later mixing with
trypsinized cells. After centrifugation the pelleted cells
were incubated in cold hypotonic solution (75 mM KCl)
for 5 min, and then fixed with methanol/ acetic acid (3:1,
v/v). The samples were then put on microscope slides, and
stained with acridine orange (20 μg/ml). The micronuclei
(MN), nuclear buds (BUD), and nuclear bridges (NPB)
in 1000 bi-nucleated cells, were counted per experimental
condition, at 400× magnification under a fluorescent
microscope (Eclipse 800; Nikon, Japan), according to
criteria published by Fenech [51]. Similarly, the numbers
of apoptotic/ necrotic cells were evaluated per 1000 cells
counted.

was defined as the distance covered by the invading cells
from the spheroid, divided by the spheroid radius.

Gene expression microarrays
Total RNA was isolated from three biological
replicates of monocultured and indirectly co-cultured
U87 and U373 cells using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen
Limited, Paisley, UK) according to manufacturer
instructions. The RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini
kit (Qiagen,UK) and the integrity of the RNA confirmed
using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
USA). The RNA samples were labeled with Illumina
TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Ambion) and hybridized
to the HumanWG-6 v3 Expression BeadChip (Illumina).
After scanning, image acquisition was performed using
the BeadStudio version 3.3.7 software (Illumina). The raw
data have been deposited with the NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) under the accession code GSE59634.

2D – Matrigel invasion assay
The invasion of U87, U251 and U373 cells, either
indirectly co-cultured with each other or exposed to the
CM (of the relevant cell type), was studied in Matrigel
coated Boyden chambers (12-well plates). The upper
surfaces of the filter inserts with 12 μm pores, (Costar,
Corning Incorporated, NY, USA) were coated with
Matrigel (50 μg/insert, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,
USA) in serum-free growth medium. The inserts were
dried overnight and reconstituted with 0.2 ml of serumfree growth medium. The cells were seeded in triplicate
either into the inserts at a density of 20 000 cells/insert
in 0.2 ml of medium, or into the wells in 0.8 ml growth
medium or CM. In the controls and when testing the
effects of CM, no cells were plated in the bottoms of the
wells. After 72 h, the cell inserts were transferred to fresh
growth medium, and MTT reagent was added to both
chambers. Three hours later, the formazan crystals were
collected separately from the upper and lower chamber
by centrifugation of the media, and they were dissolved
in 200μl of DMSO, pipetted in duplicate into 96-well
plates, with the absorbance measured as described above.
The invasion was calculated as the percentages of the
absorbance in the lower compartment per total absorbance
of the both compartments.

Quantitative real-time PCR
cDNA was generated from 1 μg total RNA using
High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kits (Applied
Biosystems, USA) in a 50 μl reaction volume, according
to the manufacturer protocol. Expression of Ccl2,
Ccl20, Dpp4 and Egflam was quantified using real-time
quantitative PCR (ABI 7900 HT Sequence Detection
System, Applied Biosystems, USA). Real-time PCR
reactions were performed using 1:10 dilutions (1 μl/
well) of each cDNA, TaqMan Universal PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the TaqMan Gene
Expression assays (all from Applied Biosystems, USA):
Ccl20 (chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20), Hs01011368_
m1; Egflam (EGF-like, fibronecting type III and laminin G
domains), Hs00794831_m1; Dpp4 (dipeptidyl-peptidase
4), Hs00175210_m1, Bcl2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma2),
Hs00608023_m1; Bax (Bcl-2 associated X protein),
Hs99999001_m1. Amplification of the GADPH probe
(pre-developed Taqman assay no. 4310884E) was
performed as the internal control. The SDS v2.2 software
was used to analyze the data according to the comparative
Ct method (∆∆Ct algorithm).

3D – collagen invasion assay
U87, U251 and U373 spheroids were generated
by hanging drops containing 600 cells in 20 μl medium.
Upon 3 days the spheroids were washed off and cultured
in 10-cm dishes for three more days to reach diameters of
150–300 μm. They were then embedded into 50 μl drops
of type I collagen matrix (1.0 mg/ml, BD Bioscience),
incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and then covered with 1
ml control growth medium or relevant CM. The spheroid
diameters and cell invasion distances were measured
under an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti; Nikon
Germany) using the NIS Elements software (Nikon,
Germany) after 1st, 3rd, and 5th day. The relative invasion

Statistical analyses
All of the above experiments were performed in
duplicate and were repeated independently at least three
times, unless otherwise stated. ANOVA tests (with posthoc Dunnett’s tests) were used to determine the effects
of co-cultures and CM on the GBM cells versus the
controls, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Data
are expressed as means ± standard error (SEM).
For the microarrays, the raw data were analyzed
using the R Project for Statistical Computing program –
version 2.13.2 [53] (http://www.R-project.org), using the
41014

Oncotarget

lumi [52] and limma [54] packages for data import and
quality control, and a robust spline normalization of log2
transformed data. For probe annotation, the Annotate:
Annotation for microarrays package, R package version
1.44.0. (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/
bioc/html/annotate. html) was used. Data were inspected
using hierarchical clustering (HCA) and the empirical
Bayes method [55] was used to detect differentially
expressed genes. Two lists of differentially expressed
genes were generated, one showing the differences
between U87 cells co-cultured with U373 cells and U87
cells grown alone (Supplementary Table S1) and the other
one showing the differences for co-cultured U373 cells
(Supplementary Table S2). Differentially expressed genes
(p-value < 0.01) of a third comparison between U87 cells
and U373 cells with both grown alone (Supplementary
Table S3) were functionally analyzed using the
Gorilla (Gene Ontology and enRichment anaLysis and
visuaLizAtion tool) [16]. BioMine data mining was also
performed for the genes of interest [56].
