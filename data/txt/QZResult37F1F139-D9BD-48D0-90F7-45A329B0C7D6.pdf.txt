ABSTRACT
RG7356, a recombinant anti-CD44 immunoglobulin G1 humanized monoclonal
antibody, inhibits cell adhesion and has been associated with macrophage activation
in preclinical models. We report results of a phase I dose-escalation study of RG7356
in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Eligible patients with refractory AML, relapsed AML after induction chemotherapy,
or previously untreated AML not eligible for intensive chemotherapy were enrolled and
received intravenous RG7356 at dosages ≤ 2400 mg every other week or ≤ 1200 mg
weekly or twice weekly; dose escalation started at 300 mg.
Forty-four patients (median age, 69 years) were enrolled. One dose-limiting toxicity
occurred (grade 3 hemolysis exacerbation) after one 1200 mg dose (twice-weekly
cohort). The majority of adverse events were mild/moderate. Infusion-related reactions
occurred in 64% of patients mainly during cycle 1. Two patients experienced grade
3 drug-induced aseptic meningitis. Pharmacokinetics increased supraproportionally,
suggesting a target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) at ≥ 1200 mg. Two patients
achieved complete response with incomplete platelet recovery or partial response,
respectively. One patient had stable disease with hematologic improvement.
RG7356 was generally safe and well tolerated. Maximum tolerated dose was not
reached, but saturation of TMDD was achieved. The recommended dose for future
AML evaluations is 2400 mg every other week.

INTRODUCTION

(16%) were previously untreated elderly patients unfit
for conventional chemotherapy. Twelve out of 43 patients
(28%) had unfavorable cytogenetics, and 11 out of 37
(30%) had FLT3 mutations. All 42 patients with available
pretreatment BM biopsy were positive for CD44 expression
on leukemic blasts by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most
common form of acute leukemia in adults, and its
incidence increases with age. With intensive chemotherapy
regimens, complete remission rates between 70% and 80%
can be achieved [1, 2]; however, the majority of patients
relapse and prognosis is very poor [3]. Treatment options
are even more limited in elderly patients because of the
high frequency of chemotherapy-resistant forms of AML
[2, 4], combined with the inability of the majority of these
patients to tolerate intensive treatments [5]. Thus, there
is a need to develop new therapies with more effective
mechanisms of action and lower toxicity as compared with
conventional chemotherapy.
CD44 is an adhesion molecule expressed on
hematopoietic precursors, including long-term cultureinitiating cells, colony forming unit–granulocyte
macrophages, and leukemic cells [6]. Its main ligand
is hyaluronic acid (HA), an extracellular matrix
glycosaminoglycan present in the bone marrow (BM)
microenvironment. Interactions between CD44 and HA are
essential to mediate the cellular adhesion and migration of
leukemic stem cells (LSC) to the stroma in the BM [7].
Consequently, administration of anti-CD44 monoclonal
antibodies (mAb) was associated with eradication of LSC
after serial transplants in immunocompromised murine
models of AML [8]. In addition, signal transduction
by CD44 regulates many cellular functions, including
myeloid differentiation [9].
The investigational drug RG7356 is a recombinant
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) humanized mAb that
specifically binds to the standard region of CD44 near
the HA binding domain. By blocking the interaction
between CD44 and HA, RG7356 inhibits cell adhesion
to HA-coated plates at nanomolar concentrations in vitro
[10]. In vitro, the RG7356-mediated disruption of the
tumor microenvironment triggers the release of specific
chemo-attractants (e.g. CCL2) that recruit and activate
macrophages, leading to the phagocytosis of RG7356opsonized tumor cells (Roche internal data).
Taken together, these data along with the known
CD44 biology and its role in leukemia supported the
rationale for clinical investigation of RG7356. We report
the results of a phase I dose-escalation study of RG7356
in patients with refractory/relapsed AML.

Safety and tolerability
RG7356 was investigated at 4 dose levels and 3
schedules (every other week, weekly, or twice weekly)
(Table 2). Median treatment duration was 23 days (range,
1–269 days), and 10 patients (23%) were treated for ≥ 60
days.
Eighteen patients were not evaluable for doselimiting toxicity (DLT) determination, owing to disease
progression prior to day 21 (n = 9), early event of aseptic
meningitis (n = 2), infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (n = 1),
incomplete dose on day 1 (n = 2), not allowed concomitant
medication (n = 1), early death due to unrelated fatal
pulmonary infection event (n = 1), and withdrawn consent
(n = 2). Only 1 DLT was observed—a grade 3 hemolysis
exacerbation occurring after 1 dose of 1200 mg twice
weekly. This patient had AML secondary to myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) with a history of long-lasting red blood
cell (RBC) transfusion dependence. Transfusion needs
had increased regularly in the weeks preceding RG7356
treatment, concurrently with several episodes of transient
increase of unconjugated bilirubin and appearance of
alloreactive anti-RhD antibodies. The baseline hemoglobin
level was 9.5 g/dL, total bilirubin was 42.3 μmol/L, and
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 134 IU/L. One hour after
the end of RG7356 administration, the patient presented
with unconjugated bilirubin increase (80.4 μmol/L) and
severe anemia (hemoglobin level, 6.8 g/dL), although
LDH level remained unchanged (137 IU/L). Direct and
indirect Coombs tests were positive, and no other markers
of hemolysis were present. Although not confirmed, a
relationship to RG7356 could not be ruled out.
Because CD44 is normally expressed on human
erythrocytes [11], we performed a systematic assessment
of direct and indirect Coombs tests in 23 patients. All
patients were closely observed for signs of hemolysis.
Indirect Coombs test was negative at baseline in all
patients for which a screening or pre-dose value was
obtained (n = 20) and was positive in 15 out of 18 patients
(83%) tested after the infusion of cycle 1. Direct Coombs
test was positive at baseline in 5 out of 21 patients (24%),
and was positive in 16 out of 18 patients (89%) tested after
the infusion of cycle 1. No other cases of hemolysis were
recorded, including in patients with positive Coombs tests.
No evidence of increase in transfusion dependency was
observed during the study and across the different cohorts.
The majority of treatment-related adverse events
(AEs) were transient and mild to moderate in severity
(Table 3). The most frequent treatment-related AEs were

Pharmacokinetics of RG7356

grade 1/2 IRRs, the majority of which occurred during
the first infusion (59%) compared with subsequent cycles
(16%). Incidence of IRRs decreased from 75% to 54%
after the slower infusion rate was implemented. There
was no apparent correlation between dose, schedule, and
incidence or severity of IRRs.
Two cases of drug-induced aseptic meningitis
(DIAM) were reported early after a dosage of 1200 mg
weekly on cycle 1, day 3. Peak concentration (Cmax) in
both patients was below the mean Cmax (369 μg/ml) of the
highest evaluated safe dose level (2400 mg), and increases
in blood cytokines were in the low range observed for
other patients, indicating no dose relationship. In 1
patient, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration was
0.8% of concomitant RG7356 serum concentration.
Although no baseline comparison was possible, we
observed high CSF levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10),
IL-1 receptor antagonist, macrophage inflammatory
protein-1 alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta
(MIP-1α, MIP-1β), IL-6, IL-8, and macrophage colony
stimulating factor-1 in this patient that were consistent
with DIAM. Both patients recovered spontaneously within
approximately 1 week, but were not rechallenged. No
additional cases of DIAM and/or associated neurologic
symptoms were recorded after intensification of steroid
premedication (methylprednisolone 100 mg was replaced
by dexamethasone 20 mg). Maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) was not reached for doses escalated up to 2400
mg every other week.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) data for cycle 1
demonstrated that the time to peak concentration (tmax)
occurred shortly after the end of the infusion (3–6 hours)
in all cohorts (Supplementary Table 1; Figure 1). For the
every-other-week regimen, there was a supraproportional
increase in mean exposure (Cmax and area under the curve
[AUC]) from the 300-mg to 1200-mg dose and less than
dose proportional from 1200-mg to 2400-mg dose. Total
clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution (Vd) were high
(relative to other IgG antibodies) at 300 mg, declined
with increasing dose, and plateaued at 1200 mg, at which
point target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) saturation
occurred. A similar PK profile was observed following
the weekly regimen at the same dose. Mean half-life
(t½) was 2–3 days and remained the same over the entire
dose range.

Responses
One complete response (CR) with incomplete
platelet recovery (CRp) and 1 partial response (PR)
were recorded. The responders had received RG7356
1200 mg every other day, had normal cytogenetics, and
no FLT3 or NPM1 mutations. One patient (CRp) was in
second relapse following chemotherapy, while the other
patient (PR) had previously untreated AML secondary
to MDS. Durations of response were 81 and 154 days,

DISCUSSION

respectively. One additional patient in the 600-mg everyother-day dose achieved stable disease with hematologic
improvement (HI; neutrophil improvement according
to 2006 International Working Group (IWG) Response
Criteria in Myelodysplasia [12]) that lasted for 26 cycles
(Figure 2). Disease control rate (CR + PR + HI) was 7%.
The majority of patients progressed, including 25% who
progressed during the first 2 cycles.

Increased expression of different LSC markers has
been associated with poor clinical outcome in patients
with AML treated with conventional chemotherapy [13],
and therefore, several of those cell surface antigens might
serve as therapeutic targets, such as CD123, C-type
lectin-like molecule 1 (CLL-1), CD47, T cell Ig mucin
3 (TIM-3), CD96, CXCR4, or CD33 [14-20]. For most
of these targets, mAbs have indeed been developed but
are still in preclinical or early clinical development. CD44
is a particularly attractive target in AML because its
expression on leukemic blasts has been confirmed in 100%
of 131 patients with various types of AML (F. HoffmannLa Roche Ltd, unpublished data). Furthermore, CD44
activation is capable of enhancing AML blast cell survival
and resistance to apoptosis [21]. CD44 also plays a key
role in LSC homing in the BM, and thus, disrupting the
LSC niche is a promising therapeutic approach given the
role played by these cells in the resistance to conventional
chemotherapy [22]. Our preclinical data show that
RG7356 can induce macrophage-mediated phagocytosis

Pharmacodynamics
During treatment with RG7356, we observed a trend
for increase of macrophages (CD68+) and decrease of stem
cell-like AML blasts (CD34+) in BM biopsies (Figure 3),
in agreement with preclinical data that suggested that
the mechanism of action of RG7356 involves active
macrophage recruitment and subsequent phagocytic
activity against tumor cells (Roche internal data). There
were no changes in the CD44 and HA expression pattern
in BM (data not shown). One patient with stable disease
and HI showed a decrease in CD34+ cells and an increase
in CD34−/CD38+ cells, suggesting blast differentiation
(Figure 2).

of target cells in vitro, which may account for most of its
direct antitumor activity (Roche internal data).
In this study, we have reported the first results of
the administration of RG7356, an IgG1 anti-CD44 mAb,
in patients with AML. Increased macrophage frequencies
were observed on BM biopsy specimens, as measured
by CD68 staining by IHC. Interestingly, this increase in
macrophages was paralleled by a decreased frequency
of CD34+ cells. In addition to this effect, 1 patient who
achieved an HI had increased frequencies of CD34−/CD38+
cells together with a reduction in CD34+ cells, suggesting
the induction of blast differentiation. This observation is
consistent with previous in vitro studies that showed that
anti-CD44 antibodies may trigger differentiation [23, 24].
The PK analysis indicated that the TMDD was
more pronounced in patients with AML (≥ 1200 mg)
compared with that observed in patients with solid tumors
(≥ 450 mg) (Roche internal data). The PK differed from

that expected for an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, with a
large Vd, high total Cl, and short t½ of < 4 days, justifying
the investigation of biweekly administration.
Overall, RG7356 administration was safe and well
tolerated. Only 1 DLT was observed, and MTD was not
reached at dosages up to 2400 mg every other week. The
most frequent AEs were moderate IRRs, which decreased
substantially after premedication intensification. Indirect
Coombs tests’ positivity was observed in 83% of the tested
patients following RG7356 administration; however, this
was not associated with hemolysis, except in 1 patient
who presented with hemolysis exacerbation after the first
infusion. In toxicology studies (in vitro blood compatibility
studies), RG7356 did not show any hemolytic potential
(F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, unpublished data). Based
on these data, the risk of hemolysis following RG7356
administration seems minimal, but the occurrence of falsepositive immunohematologic tests has to be anticipated

MATERIALS AND METHODS

for patients who may require RBC transfusions. This is
explained by the high expression of CD44 on erythrocytes
[25], which carries the Indian blood group system [26].
Two cases of DIAM were observed, both following
the first infusion of RG7356. Recovery was achieved
within a few days following steroid administration. As
a consequence, premedication using dexamethasone was
recommended by the protocol data safety monitoring
group, and no additional cases were recorded precluding
more extensive biologic analysis of suspected DIAM.
DIAM is a rare complication observed following the
administration of various drugs, such as nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, intrathecal chemotherapy,
antiepileptic drugs, and immunomodulatory/antiinflammatory agents, including intravenous Igs or mAbs
[27-29]. The pathophysiology of these 2 cases remains
elusive, and may include direct interaction of RG7356
with meninges, induction of an inflammatory response,
or hypersensitivity reactions. Recently, an increasing
number of DIAM cases following the administration of
various mAbs has been reported [30]. Overall, cases of
DIAM are probably underreported, and attention should
be paid to this rare complication in patients treated with
mAbs.
Altogether, our data show that the administration
of RG7356 doses able to saturate TMDD in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner was safe. Limited
clinical activity was seen with a disease control rate of
7% in a population of patients with advanced AML;
1 CRp, 1 PR, and 1 stable disease with HI that was
associated with reduced CD34+ cells were reported. It
is worth noting that the goal of an anti-CD44-specific
approach in AML is to target the LSC compartment. In
the context of this phase I trial, treatment activity was
evaluated by the response rate, which was tailored to
measure bulk tumor cell killing that did not necessarily
reflect the effects on LSC. Indeed, demonstration of an
effect on putative LSC in humans remains a challenge
using classic response criteria [31].
In conclusion, the administration of RG7356 is
safe at a recommended dose of 2400-mg every-otherweek, 1200 mg weekly, or 600 mg twice weekly. Based
on the observed short t½, a more frequent administration
schedule (e.g. 3 times a week) might also be worth
testing. The limited clinical activity seen here does not
support the use of RG7356 as monotherapy on patients
with florid AML; however, investigation in the context
of minimal residual disease might represent a means
to unravel selective effects on LSC. Furthermore, the
lack of clinical activity but favorable toxicity profile
of RG7356 as a monotherapy support the rationale
for further investigation as a combination therapy
with cytotoxic agents such as cytarabine or in another
clinical setting, such as consolidation or maintenance
therapy.

Patient selection
Key inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided in the
Supplemental Material. Briefly, patients were eligible if
they were diagnosed with AML according to the World
Health Organization’s criteria, and provided signed written
informed consent.
Patients were eligible regardless of CD44
expression. CD44 expression had previously been
evaluated by IHC staining in a series of 131 trephine
BM biopsies from patients with AML of all subtypes and
stages of disease; all samples were CD44+ (F. HoffmannLa Roche Ltd, unpublished data). Patients were classified
into favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable risk
groups on the basis of cytogenetics and/or molecular
abnormalities [32].

Study design
The study was conducted in 8 centers in France,
Italy, and Germany following approval by each
country’s Institutional Review Board and registration on
ClinicalTrials.gov (study identifier: NCT01641250), and
was performed in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Multiple doses and schedules
of RG7356 were assessed with the aim of determining
the MTD/optimal biologic dose (OBD). A standard “3 +
3” design was used. Cohorts of at least 3 patients were
enrolled in one of the RG7356 dosage levels administered
consecutively on an every other week, weekly, or twice
weekly schedule for each 14-day cycle.
The DLT period was defined as the first 21 study
days following first administration. The definition
of DLT is available in the Supplemental Material.
Hypersensitivity reactions and IRRs were not considered
dose-limiting.
In the absence of DLT, the RG7356 dose was
escalated by 100% increments until MTD or OBD was
reached. MTD was defined as the highest dose level below
which at least 2 patients in a dose cohort experienced a
DLT. The OBD was defined as the dose that demonstrated
the maximum/optimal pharmacodynamic activity and PK
properties.

Treatment
Based on the results of the phase I study in patients
with CD44+ solid tumors (NCT01358903) (Roche
internal data), the starting dose was defined as 300 mg
every other day. Flat doses were used. The RG7356
treatment schedule is provided in the Supplemental
Material. Premedication consisting of acetaminophen,
diphenhydramine, and corticoids (methylprednisolone

replaced by dexamethasone in the course of the study) was
mandatory for the first 2 infusions.

to thank the site and sponsor study management teams
and the patients who agreed to participate in the study.
Under the direction of the authors, editorial assistance
was provided by Tara Beers Gibson, PhD, of Envision
Scientific Solutions, and funded by F. HoffmannLa Roche Ltd.

Response and toxicity assessments
BM aspirates were performed every 14 days
provided that the patient remained in the study. IWG
response criteria were used [33]. For patients showing
no response, HI was defined as cytopenia improvements
according to the 2006 IWG Response Criteria in
Myelodysplasia [12]. All patients who received at least
1 dose of RG7356 were included for general safety or
efficacy evaluations. Toxicity was evaluated using the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events version 4.03.

Pharmacokinetic assessments
Samples were taken during cycle 1 on days 1, 2, 3,
and 8 and cycle 2 on day 1. Estimation of the PK parameters
were performed using standard noncompartmental (model
independent) methods in cycle 1. Actual sampling time
was used to calculate PK parameters. In all calculations, 0
was substituted for concentrations below the quantification
limit of the assay. Total clearance, Vd, t1/2, tmax, Cmax, AUC,
individual and mean serum RG7356 concentrations
versus time, and interpatient variability were assessed. To
determine the influence of antigen expression on actual
drug distribution and/or elimination, the TMDD was
determined. The PK analysis was performed using Phoenix
WinNonLin version 6.2.

Whole blood was sampled to assess routine blast
cell counts, circulating CD44+ leukemic blasts, and stem
cell population by multicolor flow cytometry. In addition
to routine AML markers on blasts, immunophenotyping
included the assessment of circulating LSC (CD44, CD34,
CD38, and/or additional markers), T cells (CD3, CD4,
CD8), B cells (CD19), NK cells (CD3, CD16/56), and
monocytes (CD14), and their respective CD44 expression
levels.
Serial BM aspirates were collected for
morphological routine assessments, CD44-expressing
blast cell counts, and stem cell population assessment
by multicolor flow cytometry. BM biopsy samples were
collected at pre-dose cycle 1, pre-dose cycle 3, and at
progression for routine assessments (cellularity, percent
blasts) and for exploratory markers including CD44, HA,
CD68, and CD34 assessment by IHC.
