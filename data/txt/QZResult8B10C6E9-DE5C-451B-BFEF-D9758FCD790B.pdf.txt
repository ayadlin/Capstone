ABSTRACT
Expression of the SASH1 protein is reduced in a range of human cancers and
has been implicated in apoptotic cancer cell death. This study investigated whether
increasing SASH1 expression could be a useful therapeutic strategy in breast cancer.
Ectopic SASH1 expression increased apoptosis in 7/8 breast cancer cell lines.
Subsequent in silico connectivity screening demonstrated that the clinically approved
antihistamine drug, chloropyramine, increased SASH1 mRNA levels. Chloropyramine
has previously been shown to have anti-tumour activity in breast cancer in part
through modulation of FAK signalling, a pathway also regulated by SASH1. This study
demonstrated that chloropyramine increased SASH1 protein levels in breast cancer
cells. Consistent with this the agent reduced cell confluency in 7/8 cell lines treated
irrespective of their ER status but not apoptosis incompetent MCF7 cells. In contrast
SASH1 siRNA-transfected breast cancer cells exhibited reduced chloropyramine
sensitivity. The prognostic significance of SASH1 expression was also investigated
in two breast cancer cohorts. Expression was associated with favourable outcome
in ER-positive cases, but only those of low histological grade/proliferative status.
Conversely, we found a very strong inverse association in HER2+ disease irrespective
of ER status, and in triple-negative, basal-like cases. Overall, the data suggest that
SASH1 is prognostic in breast cancer and could have subtype-dependent effects on
breast cancer progression. Pharmacologic induction of SASH1 by chloropyramine
treatment of breast cancer warrants further preclinical and clinical investigation.

INTRODUCTION

repositioned to augment SASH1 expression in cancer.
We found that the antihistamine chloropyramine induced
SASH1-dependent cell death in a panel of breast cancer
cell lines. In order to identify breast cancer subgroups that
could potentially benefit from such a strategy, we analysed
the relationships between SASH1 expression, genomic
status and clinicopathologic parameters in three large
breast tumour cohorts, identifying significant but subtypedependent relationships between SASH1 expression,
relapse and survival. These data suggest that further
studies investigating repositioning of chloropyramine are
warranted.

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer
worldwide, comprising 25% of all female cancers.
Current therapeutic strategies are based primarily on
primary tumour histopathology. Expression of hormone
(oestrogen (ER) and progesterone) and human epidermal
growth factor 2 (HER2) receptors is routinely assessed
in diagnostic practice, as these proteins are strongly
prognostic and predict responsiveness to hormoneand HER2-targeted therapies, respectively. Owing to
improved management strategies, the survival rate has
increased in the past few decades, however breast cancer
is still the second highest cause of cancer-associated
death in women [1]. For patients who experience distant
relapse, secondary disease becomes increasingly harder
to control with each line of therapy, with fewer treatment
options due to efficient clonal adaptation by the tumour
in response to new selection pressures. A key research
priority is to identify new tumour cell sensitivities and
drug targets, along with companion diagnostic markers
to enable further personalisation of therapy, achieving
maximal efficacy while minimising over-treatment.
Furthermore, deeper molecular and genetic understanding
of breast tumourigenesis is intensifying the focus on
drug repositioning as a means of capitalising on existing
resources, and fast-tracking clinical development of ‘new’
treatments.
SAM and SH3 domain containing 1 (SASH1) was
initially identified as a putative tumour suppressor gene,
based on detection of significantly lower mRNA levels
in lung, thyroid and colorectal cancers compared to
adjacent normal tissue [2, 3]. Low expression correlates
with poor prognosis in colon cancer [4] and glioma [5].
A tumour suppressive role would also be consistent with
studies demonstrating that SASH1 depletion increases
lung cancer cell line viability, proliferation and migration
[3, 6–8], and several recent studies demonstrated that
it opposes mesenchymal differentiation and invasive
cell behaviour in hepatocarcinoma, thyroid and ovarian
cancer cell lines [9–11]. The precise molecular functions
of SASH1 in normal tissues and cancer are still being
investigated, though it is known to localise to the nucleus,
and its SAM and SH3 domains imply signalling, adaptor
and/or molecular scaffold functions [12, 13]. Indeed, it can
regulate signalling through focal adhesion kinase (FAK)
and AKT/PI3K [9, 11] and overexpression promotes
apoptosis [3, 6]. SASH1 mRNA and protein levels are also
reduced in breast cancer compared to matching normal
mammary epithelia [2, 14], with one study suggesting that
promoter hypermethylation correlates with repression [14],
but the expression and prognostic significance of SASH1
have not yet been investigated in breast tumour cohorts
with appreciable clinical annotation or statistical power.
In this study we used in silico connectivity mapping
and in vitro modelling to identify drugs that could be

RESULTS
Increasing SASH1 expression is sufficient to
induce breast cancer cell line death
We initially quantified SASH1 protein expression
in eight breast cancer cell lines by immunoblot analysis.
This revealed variable expression, with three high
expressing cell lines, T47-D, BT-549 and MDA-MB-231,
two moderately expressing lines, Hs578T and SUM-315
and three low expressing lines MCF7, MDA-MB-361
and MDA-MB-468 (Figure 1A–1B). SASH1 has been
described as a tumour suppressor, with overexpression
resulting in an increase in cell death in lung cancer,
melanoma, osteosarcoma and glioma cell lines [3, 6–8].
To investigate this a SASH1-GFP fusion protein was
transiently over-expressed in breast cancer cell lines.
Overexpression resulted in cell death in 7 of the 8 lines
tested (statistically significant in 5 lines), with only the
Caspase 3-deficient MCF7 cells showing no response
(Figure 2).

Chloropyramine treatment is sufficient to induce
SASH1 expression and apoptosis in breast
cancer cell lines
Hypothesising that increasing SASH1 levels
may be a novel approach to cancer therapy, we utilised
a connectivity screen using the cmap database (Broad
Institute [15]) to identify drugs that lead to induction
of SASH1. This identified a direct correlation between
chloropyramine treatment and SASH1 mRNA expression
(p = 0.000005, z-score 2.431). Chloropyramine is a first
generation reversible H1-receptor antagonist that is
approved in several European countries for management
of allergic conditions such as conjunctivitis and bronchial
asthma.
After validating the chloropyramine-mediated
induction of SASH1 in breast cancer cell lines at the
protein level (Figure 3), we investigated whether this
treatment could mimic the effect of SASH1 overexpression on cell growth and survival. Treatment with
chloropyramine inhibited cell growth in 7 of the 8 lines

treated (Figure 4A–4H). To investigate whether this
was due to induction of apoptosis, we analysed posttreatment levels of Annexin V in the three most sensitive
cell lines, T47-D, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. All three
lines exhibited an increase in Annexin V (Figure 4I–4K),
indicating induction of apoptosis. To determine whether
the chloropyramine-induced cell death was SASH1dependent, we transfected T47-D, MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells with SASH1-targeted siRNA prior to treatment
(Figure 5A). This experiment demonstrated that SASH1
depletion partially rescued the cell death response in all
three lines (Figure 5B–5D), suggesting chloropyramineinduced cell death is at least in part dependent upon
SASH1 function.

Next, we analysed the relationships between SASH1
expression and breast cancer-specific survival by KaplanMeier analysis, separating the cohort into clinicallyrelevant subgroups. We found a strong association between
3+ nuclear SASH1 and favourable outcome in ER+ cases
(Figure 6B (i); p  = 0.008; HR 1.7 [1.16–2.67]). The
proportions of SASH1-high and –low cases were similar
in ER+ subgroups with high or low proliferative activity
(p = ns; data not shown), but stratification of outcome was
restricted to ER+ tumours with low proliferative activity
(low levels of Ki67, low mitotic score or low histological
grade; Figures 6B (i–iv)) and those co-expressing
progesterone receptor (Figure 6B (v)). Chi square analysis
showed that SASH1 was moderately associated with ER
status, but none of the other clinicopathologic parameters
available (Table 1), suggesting independent prognostic
value. Consistent with this, multivariate survival analysis
of ER+ cases using a stepwise Cox regression model
including HER2 status, Ki67 status, tumour size and
histological grade revealed that SASH1 expression was
independently associated with breast cancer specific
survival (BCSS) (Table 2; HR  =  0.45; 95% confidence
interval 0.27–0.77; p = 0.0037).
We also analysed relapse-free survival in ER+ cases
with high and low relative expression of SASH1 mRNA
by meta-analysis of breast cancer gene expression data
from the KM plotter database [18]. Consistent with our
IHC analyses, higher expression of SASH1 was associated
with better outcome in ER+ cases of luminal A molecular
subtype, but not luminal B (more proliferative) cases,

SASH1 mRNA and protein levels stratify
outcome in breast cancer
Reasoning that negative or low SASH1 expression
may be a predictive biomarker for chloropyramine, we
assessed its prognostic significance in the Queensland
follow-up cohort (n = 449 invasive breast tumours
sampled in duplicate on tissue microarrays (TMAs), with
clinical annotation including long-term survival outcome
[16, 17]). After immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of
the TMAs with a well-characterised SASH1 antibody, we
observed reasonably homogeneous nuclear staining of
breast tumour cells, and scored this as negative, weakly,
moderately or strongly positive (Figure 6A; 0, 1, 2 or 3+,
respectively).

Figure 3: Chloropyramine increases SASH1 expression in breast cancer cell lines. (A–H) Cells were treated with 25 or 50 μM
chloropyramine for 24 h, then lysates were prepared and SASH1 protein expression was analysed using immunoblotting. Immunoblot band
intensities were quantified relative to β-actin in three independent experiments. The reproducibility and significance of changes in SASH1
expression with treatment were assessed using two-tailed t-tests. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005.

and also in ER/PR+ but not ER+/PR- cases (Figure 6C).
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that this association
was independent of ERBB2 (HER2) or MKI67 (Ki67)
expression (Table 3; p = 0.0032; HR 0.74).
Interestingly, SASH1 mRNA expression was
inversely associated with relapse-free survival ER-negative
and triple-negative basal-like cases (TNBL; Figure 7A),
though this was not significant in a multivariate model
(Table 3). Similarly, SASH1 was inversely associated with
outcome in HER2+ disease (Figure 7B; p < 0.0001; HR
3.26), independent of Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) and
MKI67 (Table 3; p = 0.0002; HR 3.07). The relationship
was particularly striking for HER2+/ER+ cases where
low SASH1 was associated with nearly 100% survival
(p  =  0.0002; HR 0.06). TNBL and HER2+ subgroup
sizes in the QFU cohort were not conducive to statistical
analysis (n = 54 and 38, respectively).

cmap database (Broad Insitute [15]) and identified the
antihistamine chloropyramine as a candidate SASH1
inducer. Others have shown that chloropyramine reduces
survival of cell lines from melanoma, neuroblastoma,
breast and pancreatic cancers, involving inhibition of
FAK and VEGFR3 signalling [22–26]. Interestingly,
SASH1 has also been implicated in modulation of FAK
signalling [9]. Consistent with the connectivity screen,
chloropyramine induced SASH1 expression in seven
of the eight breast cancer cell lines tested, and reduced
the viability of six lines. Transfecting the three most
sensitive lines with SASH1 siRNA prior to treatment
partially rescued the cytotoxic response, suggesting that
chloropyramine-induced cancer cell line death is at least
partly mediated by SASH1. There is at least one existing
report suggesting that chloropyramine can reduce breast
cancer xenograft growth in vivo [26], though additional
preclinical studies are required to more comprehensively
characterise the anti-tumour activity of the agent.
If chloropyramine were to be considered for therapy,
it would be important to establish which patient group may
benefit. The prognostic significance of SASH1 expression
is less characterised in breast cancer compared with other
malignancies, so we investigated this using two clinicallyannotated tumour cohorts. Overall we found that SASH1
was associated with favourable prognosis, but stratifying
the cases based on ER status revealed that this was driven
by the more prevalent ER-positive cases (75–80% of the
cohorts analysed), and SASH1 expression was inversely
associated with outcome in ER-negative, TNBL and
HER2+ breast cancers. Thus although SASH1 has been
coined a tumour suppressor, our findings suggest that this

DISCUSSION
Based on its association with favourable prognosis
in multiple human malignancies [2–8, 19] and adverse
effects on cancer cell line viability and invasiveness
in vitro [3, 6–8], SASH1 has been proposed as a tumour
suppressor [2–4, 6, 8, 14, 20, 21]. Consistent with this, we
found that ectopic expression of SASH1 reduced breast
cancer cell line viability, and so we hypothesised it could
be involved in processes required for maintaining cancer
cell viability in vivo, and that increasing its expression
could be a novel treatment strategy.
To identify drug candidates with this capability,
we performed in silico connectivity mapping using the

may be oversimplifying its role and that context is critical.
Indeed, interrogating other KM Plotter cancer datasets
we found strong associations between SASH1 mRNA
expression and better overall survival in lung cancer but
very poor outcome in gastric cancer (data not shown).
Breast cancer management has improved
substantially over the last few decades, but in Australia,
the US and UK, 15–20% of patients still do not survive
10 years after diagnosis [27, 28]. This amounts to a large

proportion of cancer-related morbidity and mortality
and cost to the public health sector. Tumours that do not
respond to current first-line therapies are likely to be
more complex and heterogeneous. Disease control in the
future will depend on an increased understanding of the
molecular biology of the disease, leading to identification
of novel personalised medicine therapy approaches linked
to companion diagnostics. In silico connectivity screening
provides a means to fast-track the identification of

gene-drug associations and drug repurposing
opportunities. In silico mapping of associations between
induction of SASH1 and ‘off-the-shelf’ drugs identified
a novel candidate, chloropyramine, with antitumour
activity in vitro. Chloropyramine and other first-generation
H1 antagonists are sedating because they cross the
blood-brain-barrier, and were therefore superseded by
peripherally-acting agents for the treatment of allergy.
Given that brain uptake can be desirable in molecular

oncology and chloropyramine is otherwise well-tolerated,
the potential application for this or structurally related
agents for low toxicity treatment of breast and other
cancers deserves further mechanistic and preclinical
investigation. Furthermore, phase 0 and dose-finding
phase I, neoadjuvant, biomarker-driven clinical trials
could allow us to confirm pharmacodynamic induction of
SASH1 by chloropyramine that would underpin further
repurposing studies of the agent in the future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell death assay

Cell culture and transfection

Following incubation of cells with the indicated
treatments, propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) and Hoechst
(1 μg/ml) were added 30 min before imaging. Cells were
imaged on an IN Cell Analyzer 2200 (GE Healthcare;
10× objective). Live/dead cell analysis was performed
using IN Cell analysis software.

Breast cancer cell lines were cultured at 37°C
with 5% CO2 in RPMI with 10% FCS (MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-361, T47-D, and BT-549), DMEM with 10%
FCS (MCF7, MDA-MB-468, and Hs578T) or Ham’s
F12 with 5% FBS and 10 μg/ml recombinant human
epidermal growth factor (SUM1315). Insulin was
supplemented at 0.01 mg/mL for the MCF7, Hs578T,
BT-549, T47-D, and SUM1315 cell lines. Cells were
routinely passaged with trypsin and maintained at
low passage. Chloropyramine (Sigma-Aldrich) was
added to adherent cultured cells 24 hours after seeding
at the indicated concentrations (0–100 μM). Cell line
authentication by STR profiling was performed at QIMR
Berghofer, with comparison to Children’s oncology
group cell culture and Xenograft repository (http://www.
cogcell.org).
For siRNA experiments, esiRNAs (Sigma) targeting
SASH1 or non-specific control oligos were transfected
using RNAiMax (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Double-transfections were performed
24 hours apart and samples were analysed 72 hours after
the initial transfection where optimal SASH1 depletion
was observed. For overexpression studies, the fulllength SASH1 cDNA was cloned into the mammalian
expression vector pCMV6 (Origene). Three μg of DNA
(SASH1-GFP or GFP) and 6 μL of Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) were used to transfect cells in a T25 flask, as
per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested
24–48 h post-transfection for optimal overexpression and
death assessment as indicated in figure legends.

Cell confluency assay
Cells were seeded at 2,500 cells per well in 96 well
plates (Nunc). Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h
before chloropyramine addition and then imaged every
2 hours for 96 hours in an IncuCyte ZOOM® live cell
imager (Essen Bioscience) to calculate confluence.

Annexin V/Propidium iodide (PI) analysis
Annexin V/PI staining was carried out as described
previously [30]. Briefly, treated or untreated cells
(adherent and floating) were harvested using trypsin and
centrifugation, washed in PBS and then stained according
to the Promega Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection
kit protocol. Annexin V-positive (apoptotic) cells were
detected using a Gallios flow cytometer system and
quantified with Flow Jo software.

Drug screen with connectivity mapping
A gene expression connectivity mapping approach
was employed to identify candidate compounds that
may induce SASH1 expression. SASH1 was mapped
to Affymetrix HG-U133A probeset IDs to form a query
gene signature. This was compared to the reference drug
expression profiles in the CMap02 database using the
sscMap algorithm [31, 32]. Compounds with statistically
significant positive connection to the query gene signature
were selected as candidate SASH1 inducing drugs for
further laboratory validation as described.

Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was carried out as described
previously [29]. Briefly, cells were lysed (20 mM Hepes
pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2,
0.5 mM EDTA, 0.02% NP-40, freshly supplemented
with NaF, NaVO4, PMSF and protease inhibitors) and
sonicated. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and
protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad). Typically 50 µg of protein lysate was
resolved on Bolt 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and
proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad). Membranes were blocked in 2% fish skin gelatin,
1% tween-20 in PBS (Sigma) for 1 h and incubated
with primary antibodies overnight 4°C in the same
buffer. Following incubation with secondary antibodies,
membranes were visualised using a Li-COR Odyssey
infrared scanner. Fluorescence intensity was quantified
relative to a loading control (β-actin or Histone H3) using
Image J software.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tissue
microarray (TMA) analysis
SASH1 protein expression in breast cancer was
investigated by IHC analysis of the Queensland follow-up
(QFU) resource, comprising TMAs of 449 invasive breast
carcinomas (sampled in duplicate) and associated clinical
data, including survival outcomes of over 20 years [33].
The use of patient data and clinical samples in this study
were approved by human research ethics committees of
the University of Queensland and the Royal Brisbane and
Women’s Hospital (RBWH).
Four μm TMA sections were processed in a
decloaker for antigen retrieval in EDTA buffer (pH 8.8)

for 15 minutes, and then IHC was performed using an
anti-SASH1 antibody (Sigma Prestige HPA029947;
1:850), and the Mach 1 Universal HRP-Polymer Detection
kit (Biocare Medical). Haematoxylin-counterstained,
mounted sections were then scanned at 40 x magnification
on an Aperio AT Turbo slide scanner (Leica Biosystems).
Digital images of individual tissue cores were scored by
a qualified Pathologist (AMM) according to tumour cell
nuclear staining intensity. Using the maximum score of
duplicate tissue cores for each case, associations between
SASH1 expression and clinicopathologic variables were
investigated using chi-square and log-rank tests (GraphPad
Prism v6).

Statistical analyses
Most statistical tests were performed using Graph
Pad Prism V6. Associations between breast tumour
SASH1 expression and clinicopathologic variables were
investigated using chi square or Fisher’s exact tests.
Relationships between breast tumour SASH1 expression
and relapse-free or overall survival were represented with
Kaplan-Meier curves and analysed using the log-rank
test. Analysis of SASH1-mediated changes in apoptosis
and proliferation, and SASH1 expression following
chloropyramine treatment were investigated with students
two-tailed t-tests. For multivariate analysis of SASH1
mRNA prognostic significance was performed using the
parameters available (MKI67 and ERBB2 expression) and
inbuilt function in the KM plotter database [18].
For multivariate analysis of SASH1 protein
prognostic significance in ER+ breast cancer, we
performed stepwise Cox regression analysis using
MedCalc® software (v13.2) including HER2 status
(determined by SISH according to diagnostic criteria),
Ki67 status (nuclear staining in at least 20% tumour cells),
histological grade (assessed by an experienced Pathologist
(SRL) and tumour size (derived from clinical pathology
reports). These data were complete for 223 ER+ cases.
p Values > 0.05 were considered significant.
