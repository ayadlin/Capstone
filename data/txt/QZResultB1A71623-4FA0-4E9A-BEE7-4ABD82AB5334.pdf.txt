Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The mammalian host has developed a long-standing symbiotic relationship with a considerable
number of microbial species. These include the microbiota on environmental surfaces, such as the
respiratory and gastrointestinal tracks1, and also endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), comprising a
substantial fraction of the mammalian genome2,3. The long-term consequences for the host of
interaction with these microbial species can range from mutualism to parasitism and are not
always completely understood. The potential impact of one microbial symbiont on another is even
less clear. We have studied the control of ERVs in the commonly-used C57BL/6 (B6) mouse
strain, which lacks endogenous murine leukaemia viruses (MLVs) able to replicate in murine
cells. We demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of fully infectious ecotropic4 MLV (eMLV) in
B6 mice with a range of distinct immune deficiencies affecting antibody production. These
recombinant retroviruses establish infection of immunodeficient mouse colonies, and ultimately
result in retrovirus-induced lymphomas. Notably, ERV activation in immune-deficient mice is
prevented in husbandry conditions associated with reduced or absent intestinal microbiota. Our
results shed light onto a previously unappreciated role for immunity in the control of ERVs and
provide a potential mechanistic link between immune activation by microbial triggers and a range
of pathologies associated with ERVs, including cancer.
Retroviruses can establish germline infection and become part of the host genome2,3. Most,
if not all ERVs have become inactive due to mutations or transcriptionally silenced through
the action of diverse mechanisms2,3. However, RNA and protein expression of replicationdefective ERVs is frequently elevated in infection, autoimmunity and cancer2,3. Whether or
not the immune system defends against potential threats posed by ERVs is currently unclear.
To address the role of adaptive immunity in this process, we assessed ERV expression in B6
mice. We initially compared the transcriptional profiles of purified macrophages from B6
wild-type (WT) and T and B lymphocyte-deficient Rag1−/− mice. The transcripts with the

highest increase in expression levels in macrophages from Rag1−/− mice (Fig. 1a)
correspond to the env and gag genes, respectively (Supplementary Table 1), of an
endogenous eMLV locus, Emv2, a replication-defective single-copy ERV present in B6
mice5. Differential expression of eMLV was confirmed by qRT-PCR for spliced env mRNA
in macrophages (Fig. 1b), and in multiple tissues (Fig. 1c).

Other ERV families were also differentially expressed in macrophages, albeit less strongly
(1.7 – 2.1-fold) (Supplementary Table 1). Not distinguishing between members of multicopy families, expression of polytropic MLVs (pMLVs), xenotropic MLVs (xMLVs) and of
the MusD family of retrotransposons was also elevated in the lungs of Rag1−/− mice
(Supplementary Fig. 1). In line with increased MLV mRNA expression, 60-80% of total
splenocytes and all hematopoietic lineages analysed from Rag1−/− but not from WT mice,
expressed MLV surface glycoprotein (SU) (Fig. 1d, e).

Tcra−/− or Tcrd−/− mice, lacking TCRαβ and TCRγδ T cells, respectively, showed low
eMLV expression (Fig. 1f). eMLV expression was similarly low in H2-A,E−/− mice,
deficient in MHC II, MHC II-restricted T cells and T cell-dependent antibodies (Fig. 1f). In
contrast, mice lacking B cells (Ighm−/− mice) or only the ability to produce polyclonal
antibodies (Ighm−/− MD4 mice) expressed substantially higher eMLV levels than WT mice
(Fig. 1f), demonstrating that high eMLV expression characterised mice lacking antigenspecific antibodies. In addition to splenocytes from Rag1−/− mice (Fig. 1e), T and B cells
from Ighm−/− MD4, but not from WT control mice, expressed MLV SU (Fig. 1g), indicating
that eMLV can be highly expressed also in lymphocytes.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been implicated in the control of B cell responses, and both
Myd88−/− and Tlr7−/− mice have significantly reduced serum levels of natural antibodies
and a defective antibody response to immunisation or infection, including with
retroviruses6-9. Notably, expression of eMLV was dramatically elevated in Myd88−/− and
Tlr7−/− mice in comparison with WT mice (Fig. 1h). Similarly elevated eMLV expression
was observed in Tlr7−/−, but not Tlr9−/− mice housed in a different facility (Supplementary
Fig. 2).

To investigate the mechanistic link between antibody deficiencies and elevated MLV
expression, we examined the origin of eMLV transcription. The B6 genome does not contain
replication-competent eMLV proviruses and, although the Emv2 locus can produce mRNA,
it is unable to produce infectious virus due to an inactivating G to C mutation at position
3576 of the pol region5,10. In addition, Emv2 gag encodes an N-tropic capsid, which would
be restricted by the Fv1b restriction factor in B6 mice10. However, it was theoretically
possible that recombination between replication-defective Emv2 and non-ecotropic MLVs
resulted in an MLV with full infectivity11 that could spread in Rag1−/− mice. Remarkably,
plasmas of young and old Rag1−/− mice, but not of WT control mice, contained retroviruses
that were capable of replicating in murine cells in vitro (Fig. 2a), which we refer to as
Rag1−/− mouse-associated retroviruses (RARVs). Sequencing of the pol region
demonstrated repair of the Emv2-inactivating mutation in all RARV isolates
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Functional in vitro assays (Fig. 2b) and sequencing of the gag
region (Fig. 2c) showed that RARVs also exhibited B-tropism. Genome sequence
comparisons between RARVs revealed that young Rag1−/− mice harboured highly similar
viruses, which diverged substantially in old Rag1−/− mice (Fig. 2d). All RARVs were
recombinants between Emv2 and endogenous non-ecotropic MLVs (Supplementary Fig. 4).
The pol defect of Emv2 was likely restored in RARVs by recombination with Xmv43
(Supplementary Fig. 4), an ERV that contains a functional pol region but is unable to infect
mouse cells due to polymorphisms in the murine cellular receptor2. Recombination events
involving Xmv43 have also been found responsible for the emergence of leukaemogenic

MLVs in AKR mice12. However, the switch in capsid tropism resulted from recombination
with other endogenous xMLVs (Supplementary Fig. 4). Notably, the divergence of RARVs
isolated from old Rag1−/− mice was due to further recombination replacing the ecotropic env
with polytropic env either from Pmv1/5 or Pmv16 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Together, these
findings indicated the emergence of infectious eMLVs that could have infected Rag1−/−
mice and gave further rise to infectious pMLVs. Supporting this notion, the majority of gag/
pol eMLV mRNA detected in Rag1−/− mice seemed to be transcribed from integrated
RARVs, rather than the germline copy of Emv2 (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Emv2 and non-ecotropic MLV recombination events resulting in infectious eMLV
generation might occur de novo in individual Rag1−/− mice. Alternatively, these RARVs
might have been vertically transmitted through successive generations. To directly test the
latter possibility and assess the capacity of RARVs to spread in immunodeficient mice, we
established a colony of Rag1−/−Emv2−/− mice by firstly crossing an Emv2−/− male mouse13
with a Rag1−/− female mouse, and then intercrossing selected progeny to homozygosity.
These mice lack the germline copy of Emv2, meaning any infectious eMLV present would
have been vertically transmitted. Both eMLV spliced env mRNA (Fig. 2e) and MLV SU
expression (Fig. 2f) was readily detected in the spleens of Rag1−/−Emv2−/− mice in this
colony. Furthermore, analysis of eMLV env and pol DNA copies indicated extensive
replication of vertically transmitted RARVs in Rag1−/−Emv2−/− mice (Fig. 2g). In contrast,
sexual or in utero infection was not observed in separate crosses of either male or female
virus-positive Rag1−/−Emv2−/− mice with virus-free Emv2−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 6).
To further examine the potential of RARVs to replicate in Rag1−/− mice, we assessed the
frequency of tumours characteristic of retroviral infection2,3 in cohorts of Rag1−/− mice.
Notably, starting from 180 days and affecting 67% of the animals by 380 days, Rag1−/−
mice, but not WT control mice, showed signs of morbidity (Fig. 2h). Upon examination,
large tumours, often associated with anaemia, were observed in all morbid Rag1−/− mice
(Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 7). The pathogenic potential of infection with RARVs was
established in aged cohorts of vertically-infected Rag1−/− Emv2−/− mice, which developed
tumours at a comparable incidence rate (Fig. 2h).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Thymic or splenic tumours in Rag1−/− mice consisted mainly of a single MLV SUexpressing cell type, which differed between animals, and had the histological appearance of
lymphoblastic lymphosarcomas (Supplementary Fig. 8). Discrete chromosomal aberrations
were found in the majority of tumours analysed (Supplementary Fig. 8), suggestive of clonal
origin. Consistent with MLV production by tumour cells, we observed an abundance of
MLV-type particles in the extracellular space of tumour samples, but not in a spleen sample
from a healthy Rag1−/− mouse (Supplementary Fig. 9). Furthermore, a significant increase
in both eMLV env and pol DNA copy numbers was detected in all tumour samples, with one
exception where only pol DNA copies were increased (Supplementary Fig. 9), indicating
that RARVs had extensively infected the cells that gave rise to lymphomas. Together these
results support a model where multiple recombination events restore Emv2 infectivity,
leading to spontaneous retroviremia and vertical transmission to progeny, and eventually
drive an oncogenic process similar to that extensively described in mouse strains carrying
fully infectious ERVs2,3.
Our results associated lack of antibodies with establishment of infectious eMLVs in mouse
colonies. Next, we investigated the potential mode of antibody action. Antiretroviral
antibodies have a long-established role in limiting the spread of infectious endogenous
retroviruses14, both within and between animals. However, it was also possible that
antibodies were preventing a step prior to the emergence of infectious eMLV recombinants.
Rescue of Emv2 infectivity by recombination with a non-ecotropic MLV necessitates co-

expression of both proviruses in the same cell at sufficient levels for co-packaging into the
same virion. Low expression of these proviruses in WT mice could be a rate-limiting factor
in the emergence of infectious eMLVs. However, expression of certain endogenous MLVs
in mouse cells is known to be inducible, notably, by microbial products2,3,15. For example,
bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation activates non-ecotropic MLVs, and Xmv43
in particular15-19. To examine the responsiveness of ERVs and other retroelements (REs) to
microbial stimulation, we took advantage of probes or probesets in standard microarray
platforms that report ERV or RE expression. Analysis of a publicly-available dataset20
uncovered specific induction of non-ecotropic MLV transcripts by LPS and poly(I:C), and
suppression by Pam3CSK4 (Fig. 3a, b). Early Transposon (ETn) transcripts were also
induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 3a). These findings were confirmed by LPS stimulation, which
induced high MLV SU expression in WT and Emv2−/− mouse splenocytes, also in a
MyD88-independent manner (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 10). These in vitro conditions
did not significantly induce eMLV expression (Fig. 3a). However, ex vivo analysis revealed
higher expression of eMLV (Fig. 1c), as well as of other ERVs/REs (Supplementary Fig. 1),
specifically in the colon, suggestive of microbial involvement.
Antibodies have established roles in controlling intestinal bacteria and neutralising their
products, such as LPS, in the gut lumen or the systemic circulation, and antibody-deficient
mice are known to display increased microbial trasnslocation1,9,21-23. It was, therefore,
possible that antibody deficiency allowed microbial products to induce expression of MLV
proviruses in Rag1−/− mice, including the parents of recombinant RARVs (Supplementary
Fig 1). In support of this notion, and in agreement with the established role of natural IgM in
systemic clearance of bacterial LPS and protection from endotoxemia9,21,22, production of
non-hypermutated IgM alone was sufficient for eMLV control (Supplementary Fig. 11). If
antibodies required for preventing MLV expression were, indeed, against multiple microbial
products, then antibody deficiency should not result in elevated MLV expression in the
absence of microbial triggers (Supplementary Fig 12).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To begin to examine the contribution of microbial triggers, we measured eMLV expression
in specific pathogen-free (SPF) Rag1−/− mice from colonies that differed in intestinal
microbiota. Importantly, the use of embryo transfer for the rederivation of these independent
colonies removes adventitious organisms, including vertically-transmitted eMLVs.
Therefore, any RARVs found in these rederived Rag1−/− mouse colonies must be generated
de novo in the life-history of each colony. In stark contrast to Rag1−/− mice that were
maintained on neutral pH water at NIMR, colonies of Rag1−/− mice that were maintained on
acidified water expressed minimal eMLV levels (Fig. 4a). Water acidification reduced
overall bacterial diversity in the colons of Rag1−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 13 and
Supplementary Table 2) and is a common precautionary measure used in many animal
facilities that reduces bacterial colonisation within the intestinal tract and translocation into
the circulation24. Lack of eMLV expression was noted in Rag1−/− mice obtained from The
Jackson Laboratory (JAX), also maintained on acidified water (Fig. 4a). Furthermore,
minimal levels of eMLV were detected in Rag1−/− mice on neutral pH water at the Rodent
Center CHCI, ETH Zurich (RCHCI) (Fig. 4a), which harboured distinct bacterial genera in
comparison with Rag1−/− mice at NIMR (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table
2). Lastly, negligible levels of eMLV were expressed in Rag1−/− mice in germ-free facilities
at the University of Michigan (UMICH) and offered neutral pH water (Fig. 4a). The latter
two conditions also distinguished between effects of acidified water on intestinal flora and
effects on other physiological processes. Thus, high eMLV expression in independentlyrederived colonies of Rag1−/− mice correlated with the presence of the normal SPF
microbiota.

Husbandry conditions contributed to high eMLV expression also in independently-rederived
strains with distinct immunodeficiencies. Colonies of Ighm−/− and Tlr7−/− mice maintained
on acidified water at JAX expressed minimal levels of eMLV (Fig. 4b). Variable eMLV
expression levels were detected in Myd88−/− mice at JAX (Fig. 4b), likely because, once
generated, vertical transmission of infectious eMLVs was unaffected by water acidification.
Although defining the precise role of the microbiota on eMLV induction will require further
investigation, collectively our results demonstrate that the high eMLV expression
phenotype, in genotypes causing immunodeficiency, requires environmental interaction.
High eMLV expression in independently-rederived immunodeficient colonies reveals de
novo eMLV induction in each colony. It does not, however, indicate when or how often in a
colony’s life-history infectious eMLV may emerge. Adult RARV-free Rag1−/− mice,
previously on acidified water, maintained low eMLV expression following switch to neutral
pH water, indicating low probability of RARV emergence and spread in an individual
mouse. To examine if this probability is low in general or could be higher during early
mouse development, we monitored successive generations of Ighm−/− mouse colonies from
two independent rederivations, one of which was recent, into the NIMR SPF facility. This
analysis suggested that eMLV induction occurred during the first few filial generations (F)
(Supplementary Fig. 14). Moreover, eMLV-expressing Myd88−/− mice at JAX (Fig. 4b),
were at F5 of homozygous breeding. Thus, although low in individual mice, there is high
cumulative probability of infectious eMLV emergence, involving a sequence of
recombination events similar to those seen in Rag1−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 12), and
subsequent establishment in an antibody-deficient colony over a few generations.
The B6 strain historically dominated many research fields partly due to their resistance to
retrovirally-induced tumours. Our results demonstrate that this important attribute of B6
mice is conditional on their immune competence, with significant implications both for the
design and interpretation of mouse studies. Furthermore, our results also show that ERV
activation is determined by husbandry conditions, thus accentuating potential differences in
ERV expression between animal facilities.

Although well-established in the mouse2,3, an oncogenic potential of ERVs in humans has
not been observed25,26. However, non-LTR RE families have been documented to have
caused human cancers by insertional mutagenesis at the somatic level25,26. Interestingly, we
found that TLR stimulation of human cells induced expression of distinct ERVs and REs,
including the mammalian apparent long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon (MaLR)
family (Supplementary Fig. 15), previously implicated in the pathogenesis of human
lymphomas27. Transcription of human ERVs and REs can also be induced by physiological
activation of both adaptive and innate immune cells28. Moreover, increased risk of
lymphomas in humans is linked to infection or inflammation29 and also to antibody
deficiencies30. Thus, interplay between microbial symbionts, leading to ERV/RE activation,
may provide a mechanistic link between cancer and stimulation of the immune system by
microbiota or pathogenic infections.

All colonies of Rag1−/− mice tested in this study (NIMR, JAX, UMICH and RCHCI) were
established by rederivation of a common JAX stock into each of these facilities. This
process ensures the removal of adventitious agents, including infectious eMLVs, and leads
to colonisation of the newly-rederived mice with the specific microbiota of each facility (or
the lack of colonisation in the case of the germ-free facility). These independent colonies
were maintained by homozygous breeding for at least 12 and up to 45 filial generations
(F12-F45) prior to testing.
Colonies of Ighm−/− mice at NIMR and JAX were also established by rederivation. The
Ighm−/− mouse colony at JAX was at least the F15 of homozygous breeding prior to testing.

and conducted according to local guidelines and regulations.
Expression analyses
For transcriptional analysis, peritoneal exudate cells were isolated from B6 or Rag1−/− mice
and were subsequently purified by cell sorting, performed on MoFlo cell sorters (Dako, Fort
Collins, CO, USA), as CD11b+MHC-IIhiB220−Gr1− macrophages. RNA was isolated from
the cells using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, US), according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Purified RNA samples were checked for quality using the Agilent bioanalyzer
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Synthesis of cDNA, probe labelling and hybridisation
were performed using Affymetrix MouseGene 1.0 ST oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). Primary microarray data from triplicate arrays were analysed with
GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and deposited at http://

ERV/RE transcription was quantified in various tissues by real-time quantitative reverse
transcription-based PCR (qRT-PCR). Briefly, organs were removed from mice and placed in
TRI reagent or RNAlater reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at each animal facility.
For mice bred outside NIMR, tissues were then shipped to NIMR for further processing.
Total RNA was isolated with TRI reagent, precipitated with isopropanol and washed in 75%
ethanol before being dissolved in water. DNase digestion and clean-up was performed with
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cDNA produced with the High

RNase-inhibitor (Promega Biosciences, Madison, US). A final clean-up was performed with
the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). RNase-free water (Qiagen) and later nucleasefree water (Qiagen) was used throughout the protocol. Purified cDNA was then used as

sequences. Three separate stringencies were used in the screening: 90% (>90% length,
>90% nucleotide homology), 95% (>95% length, >95% nucleotide homology) and 100%
(identical matching required). For microarray platforms where single transcripts are
represented by multiple probes, an additional screen was imposed to ensure >75% of probes
gave appropriate BLASTn hits. Under this threshold, probes were assumed to be divided
across a RE-gene boundary and were excluded from further analysis. Probes were compiled
from the 90% stringency analysis for human and mouse REs and from the 100% stringency
analysis for low-copy C57BL/6J ERVs. These were used to produce a Python tool,
REsearch, which will be described in detail elsewhere, and the code of which is available
upon request, to mine RE expression from text-based microarray analysis output.
Emv2/eMLV copy number analysis
DNA copy numbers of Emv2/eMLV were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
on DNA samples isolated from the indicated organs or tumours using the following primers
(Eurofins MWG Operon):

Emv2/eMLV env DNA – 169 bp product. Primers modified from published sequences49.
Forward 5′-AGGCTGTTCCAGAGATTGTG-3′
Reverse 5′-TTCTGGACCACCACACGAC-3′

Emv2/eMLV pol DNA – 76 bp product. Primers previously described56.
Forward 5′-CACTTTGAGGGATCAGGAGCC-3′
Reverse 5′-CTTCTAGGTTTAGGGTCAACACCTGT-3′
Signals were normalised for the amount of DNA used in the reactions based on
amplification of the single-copy Ifnar1 gene with the following primers:

Ifnar1 DNA – 150 bp product
Forward 5′-AAGATGTGCTGTTCCCTTCCTCTGCTCTGA-3′
Reverse 5′-ATTATTAAAAGAAAAGACGAGGCGAAGTGG-3′
Copy numbers were calculated with a ΔΔCT method, using splenic DNA from B6 mice as
control, which was assigned a value of 1 copy per haploid genome, N.
Sequencing and sequence analyses
Bacterial genera diversity was determined in faecal samples from the large intestines of
mice, by high-throughput sequencing of amplicons of bacterial DNA encoding 16S
ribosomal RNA, using a the Roche FLX Genome Sequencer. Samples were either collected
at NIMR or at RCHCI and were subsequently transported frozen to NIMR, where DNA was
isolated, using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNA amplification, sequencing
and metagenomic analysis was performed by DNAVision (Gosselies, Belgium).
The region of the pol gene carrying the inactivating mutation in Emv2 was sequenced in
isolated RARVs as described below. A 708bp fragment spanning this region was amplified
from genomic DNA isolated from Mus dunni cells infected with the respective RARV using
the following primers (Eurofins MWG Operon):

PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and subjected
to sequencing at Source BioScience (Cambridge, UK).
Sequence analyses, comparisons and alignments were performed with Vector NTI v11.5
(Invitrogen). RARV contigs were aligned against B6 MLVs as previously defined54using
MAFFT within UGENE software57,58. Distance plots were calculated with RDP
(Recombination Detection Program) v4.16, using a 100 bp window and a 10 bp shift58.
RARV phylogenetic analyses were performed with PHYLIP (Phylogeny inference package)
v3.2 within UGENE software.
FACS

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cell suspensions from spleens, lymph nodes or peritoneal exudates were stained with
directly-conjugated antibodies to surface markers, obtained from eBiosciences (San Diego,
CA, USA), CALTAG/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA), BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA,
USA) or BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA). MLV SU was detected using the 83A25
monoclonal antibody59 (rat IgG2a, anti-MLV SU) as the primary reagent, followed by
staining with a biotinylated anti-rat IgG2a antibody (clone RG7/1.30, BD Biosciences) as
the secondary reagent, and a streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE) conjugate (BioLegend) or a
streptavidin-PE Texas Red conjugate (CALTAG/Invitrogen) as the tertiary reagent. Fourand 8-color cytometry was performed on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and CyAn (Dako,
Fort Collins, CO) flow cytometers, respectively, and analysed with FlowJo v8.7 (Tree Star
Inc., Ashland, OR, USA) or Summit v4.3 (Dako) analysis software, respectively.
Retroviral isolation and assays
For the isolation of infectious MLVs plasma samples obtained from Rag1−/− mice were
incubated with Mus dunni cells transduced with the XG7 replication-defective retroviral
vector, expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a human cytomegalovirus (hCMV)
promoter and a neomycin-resistance gene under the control of the LTR60. The presence of
infectious MLVs was examined after 10-14 days of culture by testing for the presence of
pseudotyped XG7 vector in culture supernatant. For this, culture supernatant of XG7transduced Mus dunni cells that had been incubated with plasma samples was subsequently
added onto untransduced Mus dunni cells, which were then assessed for GFP expression by
flow cytometry 3 days later. The Fv1 tropism of infectious MLVs was determined by adding
serial dilutions of culture supernatant of XG7-transduced Mus dunni cells that had been
incubated with plasma samples onto B-3T3 or N-3T3 cells. Infection was quantified by GFP

expression in these cells 3 days later. B-tropic and N-tropic stocks of F-MLV, obtained as
culture supernatant of Mus dunni cells chronically infected with these viruses, were used as
controls. Results were expressed as B:N ratios, which were the percentage of GFP+ cells in
B-3T3 cultures, divided by the percentage of GFP+ cells in N-3T3 cultures.
Histology

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For histological analysis, organs were collected in formalin immediately after culling of
donor mice. Histological sections were prepared and stained with haematoxylin and eosin
and assessed by Dr Mark Stidworthy at IZVG Pathology, Leeds, UK.
Transmission electron microscopy
Samples were immersion fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde and post-fixed
in 1% osmium tetroxide using 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.2. Aqueous uranyl
acetate was followed by dehydration through a graded ethanol series and propylene oxide.
Samples were then embedded in Epon and 50nm sections mounted on pioloform coated
grids and stained with ethanolic uranyl acetate followed by Reynold’s lead citrate. They
were viewed with a JEOL 100EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan)
equipped with an ORIUS 1000 CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA).
Statistical analyses
Statistical comparisons were made using SigmaPlot 12.0 (Systat Software Inc., Germany).
Parametric comparisons of normally-distributed values that satisfied the variance criteria
were made by unpaired Student’s t-tests. Pairwise comparisons of data sets that did not pass
the variance test were compared with non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney Rank Sum.
Bacterial diversity was compared with Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests with Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons. Tumour incidence rates were compared by Log-Rank
Survival analysis of Kaplan-Meier curves. ANOVA and statistical comparisons of
microarray data were made using GeneSpring GX, with Benjamini–Hochberg false
discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons.

Figure 4. eMLV activation in antibody-deficiency depends on husbandry conditions

a, eMLV spliced env mRNA expression in the spleens of Rag1−/− mice on neutral pH (SPF)
or acidified water (pH 2.5) at NIMR, on acidified water (pH 2.8) at JAX, on neutral pH at
RCHCI or in germ-free (GF) facilities at UMICH (p<0.016 between Rag1−/− mice at NIMR
SPF and all other groups; one-way ANOVA). b, eMLV spliced env mRNA expression in
the spleens of Ighm−/−, Myd88−/− or Tlr7−/− mice on neutral pH water (SPF) at NIMR or on
acidified water (pH 2.8) at JAX (p=0.005 and p=0.029 for Ighm−/− and Tlr7−/− mice,
respectively; unpaired Student’s t-test). Each dot is an individual mouse and values above
103 were considered high and are indicated with red-filled symbols.
