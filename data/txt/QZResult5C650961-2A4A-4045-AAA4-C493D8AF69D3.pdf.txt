Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BACKGROUND—Men who receive androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer
experience several side effects from this treatment. A few recent studies have examined the
cognitive implications of ADT and how they impact a patient’s treatment decision-making,
occupational pursuits, and quality of life. For this report, the authors explored possible
mechanisms for this association, reviewed research in animal studies and aging men, and
examined the growing literature focused on the relation between ADT and cognitive functioning
in patients with prostate cancer.
METHODS—A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Information
Sciences Institute Web of Knowledge-Web of Science databases to identify relevant studies that
investigated the relation between ADT in men with prostate cancer and its cognitive effects.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RESULTS—Testosterone and its derivatives may have an impact on cognition through several
mechanisms in the brain, as supported by studies of animals and in aging men. Studies that
researched the impact of ADT on cognition in patients with prostate cancer patients were designed
relatively well but suffered from small sample sizes. Between 47% and 69% of men on ADT
declined in at least 1 cognitive area, most commonly in visuospatial abilities and executive
functioning. Some studies reported contradictory results with increased functioning in verbal
memory.
CONCLUSIONS—There is a strong argument that androgen-ablation therapy is linked to subtle
but significant cognitive declines in men with prostate cancer. The authors believe that clinicians
should become aware of this correlation as the use of ADT increases and should inform and
monitor patients for this possible side effect of treatment.

Patients with prostate cancer who have early-stage disease can choose between 3 treatment
options (ie, surgery, radiation, or watchful waiting), which allow men to select treatments
with regard to quality-of-life implications. Men who are diagnosed with metastatic disease
do not have the luxury of choice; androgen-ablation therapy is the standard initial treatment.
It is well known that androgens drive the growth of prostate cancer cells.1 The most
common way to achieve androgen ablation is through chemical castration with the use of
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists. In the US, leuprolide (Lupron)
and goserelin (Zoladex) the 2 most widely used LHRH agonists to significantly decrease the
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in men with late-stage prostate cancer and to help
manage disease progression. Because LHRH agonists have little or no impact on adrenal
sources of androgens (which may account for 5% to 10% of testosterone), nonsteroidal
antiandrogens sometimes are combined with LHRH agonists to produce a combined
androgen blockage.2,3 Generally, these medications are effective at controlling the disease
for on average 18 to 24 months, after which time PSA levels may start to increase and
disease progression may develop.4 Despite this, men usually stay on the LHRH agonist for
the duration of their life, because these medications continue to slow disease progression.5

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For years, androgen-ablation therapy was indicated solely for patients with late-stage
prostate cancer. However, researchers have proven a survival benefit for androgendeprivation (AD) therapy (ADT) in certain situations for earlier stages of prostate cancer.
Several studies have indicated that androgen-ablation therapy in conjunction with primary
radiotherapy could lead to improved overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone.6,7
In addition, researchers are exploring the effectiveness of using ADT in men with rising
PSA. Using ADT in this group of men would lead to an increase in the percentage of men
with prostate cancer undergoing this form of therapy. In fact, the men in the rising PSA
group may use ADT for a longer duration than men with late-stage prostate cancer, such that
ADT for men with rising PSA may last for as long as 5 to 10 years or more.5 A detailed
description of the current practices regarding the administration of LHRH agonists is beyond
the scope of this report; however, interested readers are referred to the study by Loblaw et al
for American Society of Clinical Oncology practice guidelines.3
Several side effects and quality-of-life implications accompany ADT, including hot flashes,
osteoporosis, anemia, fatigue, sarcopenia, gynecomastia, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction,
risk of diabetes, risk of cardiovascular disease and fatal cardiac events, as well as possible
emotional distress.8–12 Recently, review articles discussing the side effects of androgenablation therapy have stated that this treatment also impacts cognitive functioning.8,10
Cognitive deficits can impact a patient’s ability to make informed treatment decisions,
occupational or intellectual pursuits, and overall quality of life. However, only a few
relatively small studies have investigated the impact of this treatment on cognitive
functioning, and some of those studies reported contradictory results. In this report, we

present the first review of these studies and attempt to summarize the results of this literature
to date. In doing so, we discuss the possible mechanisms for the relation between
testosterone and cognition, review the literature available from animal studies and studies in
aging and/or hypogonadal men, and discuss the existing research on ADT in men with
prostate cancer and its effect on cognitive functioning.

Potential Mechanisms of Action

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Researchers only recently have begun to clarify the mechanisms that explain the potential
association between testosterone and cognitive functioning.13 It is important to recognize
that 98% of testosterone circulates in the bloodstream bound to protein.14 In men,
approximately 40% of testosterone binds irreversibly to the hepatic protein, sex hormonebinding globulin. The remaining 60% of testosterone binds weakly to albumin and can
dissociate easily from protein.15 Thus, it is this ‘free’ testosterone that is available for
biologic activity. Once secreted, testosterone can undergo several biologic changes
peripherally, including conversion to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5αreductase and conversion to estradiol by the enzyme aromatase.16 In addition, both estradiol
and DHT are present throughout the male brain.17 Aromatase facilitates local conversion
from testosterone to estradiol in brain tissue,18 which is important because both testosterone
and estradiol appear to affect cognition in men.19

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Studies indicate that testosterone, estradiol, and DHT have activity in the brain that may
impact cognition in different ways. Testosterone may impact cognition through several
mechanisms. For example, activation of calcium channels in the brain occurs through rapid,
nongenomic methods of action on G-protein-coupled, agonist sequestrable testosterone
membrane receptors that initiate a transcription-independent signal pathway.17 Testosterone
also may impact cognitive performance directly through modulating neurotransmitters and
stimulating neuronal connectivity, decreasing β-amyloid peptide production, and preventing
N-methyl-D-aspartate excitotoxicity,20 mechanisms implicated in cognitive disorders such
as Alzheimer disease or dementia. Furthermore, some estrogen studies have highlighted
several possible mechanisms through which this hormone can impact cognitive
functioning.21 These include increasing cholinergic activity through its action of choline
acetyltransferase, maintenance of dendritic spine density on CA1 pyramidal cells of the
hippocampus and facilitating induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus,
increasing serotonergic and cholinergic activity to maintain neural circuitry, altering
lipoprotein, and decreasing risk of cerebral ischemia.22,23 On the basis of estrogen’s actions,
similar mechanisms may exist for testosterone but require further investigation.
The conversion from testosterone to DHT also is important. Androgen receptors have 4
times greater affinity for DHT than for testosterone, suggesting that DHT is a more powerful
androgen.17 However, its effects on cognition are less clear. In the brain, these androgen and
estrogen receptors colocalize in several areas that are important for learning and memory,
such as the thalamus, the hippocampus, and the cerebral cortex.23 In addition, CAG repeat
polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene may be associated with cognition.24

Effects of Testosterone on Cognition From Animal Studies
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Animal studies have demonstrated the effects of testosterone and/or its metabolites on
cognitive functioning. The studies discussed below have explored the effects of androgens
on the brain structures involved in cognition as well as the relations between testosterone
and cognitive performance. These animal studies indicate a strong association between
testosterone and hippocampal structures, thereby suggesting that testosterone may affect
working memory. In addition, although testosterone and estradiol both impact cognition,
they may influence cognitive functioning in different ways. The evidence suggests that,
whereas testosterone impacts working memory, estradiol has implications for the rate of
learning.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Several animal studies have suggested that testosterone may exert cognitive effects on the
hippocampus. Castration decreases hippocampal CA1 synapse density, which can be
reversed by the administration of testosterone or DHT.25,26 Testosterone and DHT appear to
help maintain normal spine synapse density by acting primarily on androgen receptors.
Androgen-induced changes in hippocampal structure may contribute to the effects of
testosterone on hippocampally mediated behaviors.26 Mechanistically, MacLusky and
colleagues observed that testosterone replacement in orchiectomized rats returned CA1
synapse density to levels comparable to those in intact males, indicating a possible
physiologic role comparable to that of estrogen in activating synaptogenesis in CA1 spine
synapses.27 Also, Edinger and colleagues observed that 5α-reduced androgens had
analgesic, anxiolytic, and cognitive-enhancing effects in the hippocampus.28,29
This association between testosterone and hippocampal changes suggests that these
hormones may affect tasks such as short-term or working memory. Castration or
orchiectomy causes impairment in working memory retention25 as well as in working
memory acquisition of a spatial maze task.30 Although the effects seem to be inconsistent,
the effects of hormone enhancement on cognitive performance in male rats appear to be
task-specific. For example, it has been demonstrated that estradiol enhances the rate of
learning as opposed to merely improving performance, and testosterone appears to improve
working memory in male rats. Similar to observations in female rats, gonadal hormones
appear to influence cognitive performance in males.31

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Initial evidence also suggests that maintaining a balance between serum testosterone and
estradiol levels may be critical to performance on memory tasks.32 The absence of testicular
hormones may increase the sensitivity of castrated male rats to the impairing effects of
scopolamine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist) and mecamylamine (a nicotinic receptor
antagonist) on working memory.30 In contrast, Johnson and Burk noted that loss of
circulating androgens did not make the animals more susceptible to challenges of the
cholinergic system. Rather, androgen levels in excess of physiologic norms seemed to
impair attentional processing.33 Testosterone actually may decrease activity of the
cholinergic system during nonspatial tasks and, thus, work in concert with the antagonism
produced by scopolamine.34

Decreasing levels of testosterone, pregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone are associated
with aging in mice and may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory.
Increasing the testosterone levels in aging mice appears to improve cognition.35 Treating
older mice with testosterone or DHT improves working memory and decreases circulating
levels of estradiol in aged rats. When applying this animal research to humans, testosterone
therapy in aging men may provide positive effects on cognition and on neural regions linked
to cognition (eg, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex).32

Testosterone Levels and Cognitive Functioning in Older Men
Although they are not entirely consistent, the findings from studies of older men and/or
hypogonadal men generally indicate that testosterone and estradiol impact cognitive
performance in men.14 In these studies, testosterone and estradiol seem to impact
visuospatial abilities, verbal fluency, memory, and working memory in a task-specific
manner.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The production of testosterone in men declines slowly and consistently after the age of 30
years. In a longitudinal study, Harman et al observed that the rates of hypogonadism in men
in their 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s were 9%, 34%, 68%, and 91%, respectively.36 The
implications of this decline on cognitive functioning still is relatively unknown because of
the great deal of inconsistency in the studies conducted in this area.37 Because the decrease
in testosterone levels in older men are similar to those observed in hypogonadal men, studies
in this area are conducted in both older men and/or hypogonadal men. This can cause some
confusion, and when we indicate ‘hypogonadal’ men, we do not mean ‘aging men’; instead,
‘hypogonadal’ refers to men who met the criteria to be defined as hypogonadal in the
specific study.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Sherwin hypothesized that declining testosterone would decrease visuospatial abilities and
that declining estradiol would decrease verbal abilities,14 because cognitive research
comparing men and women has consistently indicated that men score higher on visuospatial
tasks and that women excel in verbal abilities.38 Correlational studies indicating that
testosterone and estradiol levels are associated with cognitive functioning in older men
partially support this hypothesis; however, the impact appears to encompass more than
visuospatial and verbal abilities. A cross-sectional study demonstrated a positive association
between free testosterone and working memory, visual scanning, and perceptual
organization in elderly men.23 Testosterone also may correlate with mental control, longterm verbal memory, and spatial abilities.39 In terms of estradiol, older men demonstrated a
positive correlation between higher estradiol levels and spatial span performance.40 In a
longitudinal study, estradiol was correlated with improved scores on working memory in
elderly men (Table 1).41
A few studies also have examined the impact of the administration of testosterone to older
and/or hypogonadal men (Table 2). In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that studied the
effects of sex steroids on working memory, a group of older, hypogonadal men received
intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate and scored higher on working memory
after a month of treatment compared with hypogonadal men who received placebo.42 The

administration of testosterone in older hypogonadal men may improve verbal fluency,43
although a later cross-sectional study indicated that testosterone injection blocked the
practice effect in verbal fluency.44 Cherrier et al reported that a group of older healthy men
who were administered testosterone and estradiol scored higher on spatial memory, spatial
abilities, and verbal memory compared with a placebo group.45 A double-blind RCT
conducted by Cherrier et al indicated that healthy older men who were taking testosterone
could improve verbal memory but that this improvement depended on aromatization of
testosterone to estradiol. Enhanced spatial memory, however, occurred in the absence of an
increase in estradiol.46 In another double-blind RCT, Cherrier et al learned that, in healthy
older men, moderate levels of testosterone supplementation improved verbal and spatial
memory, whereas low or large increases in circulating testosterone demonstrated no
significant changes in cognition.47

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To summarize, the literature conducted in animals and older men supports the rationale to
investigate the impact androgen-ablation therapy in men with prostate cancer may have on
cognitive functioning. In addition, early research on the mechanisms that may explain
testosterone’s impact on cognition has provided the possible explanation for this association.
The findings from this research suggest that the depletion of testosterone may impact the
areas of working memory, verbal memory, and visual spatial ability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used a systematic literature search by using the PubMed database and the Information
Sciences Institute (ISI) Web of Knowledge-Web of Science to identify pertinent studies that
examined the relation between hormone therapy in men with prostate cancer and the
cognitive effects observed in these patients. Firs, wet used keywords ‘androgen deprivation
therapy’ and ‘cognition’ to perform the PubMed search. Then, we used ISI Web of
Knowledge-Web of Science to cross reference articles that cited the article identified
through PubMed. Because there are only a few relevant studies on this subject, all the
studies identified are reviewed below.
Cognitive Functioning and Androgen-Ablation Therapy in Men With Prostate Cancer

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The following studies are the first in a growing body of literature that has researched the
impact of androgen ablation on cognitive functioning. These generally are well designed
studies that use a longitudinal design with controls to examine these cognitive implications.
These studies, as often is true for initial studies, suffer from small sample sizes and, thus,
have reduced power. From these studies, we can draw the conclusion that androgen-ablation
therapy appears to have subtle yet significant negative effects on specific domains of
cognition as opposed to inducing gross cognitive changes that sweep across all cognitive
domains (Table 3). This is evident in the finding that most of these studies examined
multiple domains of cognition yet generally reported results in only 1 or 2 of these domains.
Animal studies and studies in hypogonadal men suggest that testosterone may correlate with
working memory, verbal memory, and visuospatial abilities. Thus, it is reasonable that the
cognitive domains that appear to be most susceptible to the impact of androgen ablation in
this research are visuospatial abilities (including visuospatial memory), working memory,

and executive functioning. It is noteworthy that studies have reported contradictory results in
the area of verbal memory, with some studies suggesting an improvement in verbal memory
and others reporting a decline in verbal memory.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Green et al were the first to systematically research the impact of androgen-ablation therapy
on the cognitive functioning of men with prostate cancer. Sixty-five men (mean age, 73
years) with advanced prostate cancer were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 groups: leuprolide
(N = 19), goserelin (N = 20), cyproterone acetate (N = 11), and monitoring without hormone
treatment (N = 15). All men participated in a battery of neuropsychological assessments at
baseline (ie, 1 week before treatment) and then 6 months later. PSA and testosterone levels
decreased significantly from baseline to 6 months for the 3 hormonally treated groups.
Conflicting results emerged in the memory domain; men in the goserelin group surprisingly
improved on 2 measures of memory (verbal [Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised] and visual
[Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test]) but declined in another measure of verbal memory
(Auditory Verbal Learning Test). The goserelin group also declined in a measure of
executive functioning (Trails B). Of the 50 men on active treatments, 24 men showed a
reliable decline (ie, >1 standard deviation) on at least 1 cognitive task, and 7 men showed a
reliable change on 2 tasks, whereas the monitoring-only group showed no decline on any of
the tasks.48
Cherrier et al studied the impact of intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) on cognitive
functioning in 19 men with increasing PSA after primary therapy for prostate cancer and
compared these men with 15 healthy community controls. Cases and controls underwent
validated neuropsychological assessments before the onset of IAS, at 9 months (the
conclusion of IAS), and at 12 months (3 months off IAS). The patients ranged in age from
51 years to 76 years. Mean testosterone levels decreased significantly for the IAS group
from baseline (3.6 ng/mL) to the 9-month assessment point (0.26 ng/mL), and then
significantly increased at the 12-month assessment (3.2 ng/mL). At the 9-month assessment
point, 69% of men in the IAS group demonstrated a clinically significant decline in a
visuospatial ability task (mental rotation), and, at 12 months, the control group outperformed
the IAS group on a measure of visuospatial memory (route test).49

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In a longitudinal study, Almeida et al followed 37 patients with prostate cancer who started
a 36-week course of androgen-ablation therapy.50 Those researchers assessed cognition with
the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly-Cognitive Battery
(CAMCO-G) and with tests of verbal memory, visual memory, and visuospatial ability.
They assessed the patients a total of 8 times over 1 year. At the end of the 36-week course of
ablation therapy, they observed an increase in performance on a test of verbal memory and
visual memory. At the 1-year follow-up assessment (18 weeks off of ablation therapy), there
was a significant increase in total CAMCO-G scores and verbal memory. These results
suggest that androgen-ablation therapy may have a positive impact on verbal and visual
memory and that the removal of the treatment has a similar impact. These results should be
reviewed with caution, because the extremely frequent administration of neuropsychological
tests leads to practice effects (ie, patients improve over time with practice), and no
comparison group was included in the study. It is quite possible that the results of this study
were artifacts because of practice effects.

Salminen et al researched the cognitive effects of ADT on 26 men who were diagnosed
recently with prostate cancer and who began ADT 2 months before radiotherapy.
Assessments occurred at baseline, at 6 months, and at 12 months. The neuropsychological
battery consisted of 14 tests that took 3 hours to administer. The average age of the sample
was 65 years, and all men reached castrate level at 6 months. From baseline to 12 months,
tests of visuomotor speed and of reaction time saw significant decreases. The decline in
testosterone coincided with a decline in visuomotor processing (digit symbol), reaction time
(10-choice reaction time), working memory speed (subtraction), sustained attention
(vigilance), and recognition speed (recognition of letters).13

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Salminen et al also conducted a prospective study of men with newly diagnosed prostate
cancer to investigate the association between ADT and estradiol decline and the impact of
ADT on cognitive performance. For that study, cognitive testing was conducted on 23 men
with prostate cancer (mean age, 65 years) at baseline, at 6 months, and at 12 months of AD.
An extensive, standardized, cognitive test battery was given at these time points. The
findings indicated a subsequent correlation between the cognitive domains of verbal fluency,
visual recognition, and visual memory and a decline in estradiol during AD. Other cognitive
domains appeared to be unaffected by estradiol decline during 12 months of AD. These
results suggest marginal but selective associations between testosterone decline, estradiol,
and cognitive performance.51

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Bussiere et al52 studied performance on several memory tasks in a group of 14 men who
were receiving ADT (mean age, 67 years; average, 1991 days on androgen-ablation therapy)
compared with an age-matched group of 16 healthy men. That study did not examine any
other domains of cognitive functioning. Twelve of the men from the study group received
leuprolide acetate, and the other 2 men underwent orchiectomy. The memory tasks included
3 parts: encoding, retention interval, and recognition. Retention measurements occurred at 3
intervals: immediate, at 2 minutes, and at 12 minutes. At each interval, the men were
presented with sets of words from the encoding phase to determine whether they recognized
them. AD did not affect encoding or retrieval significantly, but it did impair retention. There
was no significant difference between the study group and the control group at the
immediate condition. However, at the 2-minute and 12-minute intervals, the study group
could recognize words no better than chance, whereas the control group continued to
perform above chance.52
In a longitudinal study, Beer et al took a different approach and examined the effects of
estradiol administration in men with prostate cancer who previously underwent AD. The
study included 18 men with prostate cancer (mean age, 70 years; average, 1954 days on
androgen-ablation therapy) and 2 control groups. One group of controls consisted of agematched men with prostate cancer who were undergoing AD but not receiving the estradiol
treatment, and the other control group consisted of age-matched, healthy men. At baseline
and then 4 weeks later, the study used the immediate and delayed paragraph tests to test
long-term memory, Subject Ordered Pointing), and Trail tests to assess working memory.
The baseline results showed that men with prostate cancer (both groups) performed
significantly worse than the controls, specifically in their immediate and delayed verbal
memory scores. After the estradiol replacement treatment, the study group improved in

immediate verbal memory and delayed verbal memory, whereas there was no improvement
in the control groups. Further analysis indicated that only immediate verbal memory
improved significantly in the study group.53
In a pilot study, Jenkins et al assessed 32 men with standard neuropsychological assessments
at 3 time intervals: at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months. The average age of these men was
67.5 years, and they used androgen-ablation therapy for 3 to 5 months. Twenty-five healthy
men, similar in age, served as the control group. Although there was no overall group effect,
a greater percent of men in the ablation group reported a significant cognitive decline in 1
task (47%) compared with the control group (17%; odds ratio, 4.412; P < .05) at the 3month time point. There were no significant differences between the groups at the 9-month
time point. On specific domain analysis, the tasks most impacted at the 3 month time point
were spatial memory and ability.54

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Joly et al compared physical and cognitive function in a cross-sectional study of 57 patients
who were receiving ADT for nonmetastatic prostate cancer and 51 healthy, age-matched
controls. Thirty patients received ADT as adjuvant treatment after prostatectomy or
radiotherapy, and 27 patients received ADT for increasing levels of PSA. The median
duration on ablation therapy was 1.8 years (range, 0.4–7.4 years). To assess cognitive
functioning, the researcher administered the Sensitivity Cognitive Screen and a self-reported
assessment on cognitive deficits (the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Cognitive
Scale [FACT-COG]). In contrast to other studies cited above, Joly and colleagues observed
that, although men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer who received ADT experienced more
treatment-related symptoms, they demonstrated no differences in cognitive function on
either the High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen or the FACT-COG. The authors suggested that
the High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen may not be sensitive enough to detect the subtle
cognitive changes that occur after ADT. In addition, self-report of cognitive function has not
been correlated consistently with actual neuropsychological testing.55

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The research outlining possible mechanisms between testosterone and cognition, the data
from animal studies, and the results from studies researching cognition in older men support
a rationale to investigate the association between ADT and cognitive functioning. The
growing literature that has explored this question in men with prostate cancer also generally
supports the connection between AD and cognitive decline.
However, there are important points with regard to the results and to issues of methodology
that should be emphasized when drawing conclusions from this literature. In terms of the
results from the studies, the cognitive changes appear to be subtle and impact specific
domains as opposed to gross changes that sweep across multiple aspects of cognitive
functioning. For example, a large percentage of men (range, 47%–69%) reported a decline
in at least 1 task area; however, Green et al reported that only 14% of men experienced
declines in ≥2 areas. Also, it is significant that these studies generally tested multiple
domains of cognitive functioning yet observed differences in only 2 or 3 domains. The
specific domains that are most likely to be impacted are visuospatial abilities and executive

functioning. It is noteworthy that the studies reported contradictory results in verbal
memory.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It is also important to highlight issues of methodology within this body of literature. There is
significant variability in terms of the types of cognitive tests administered. Most studies used
comprehensive neuropsychological batteries; however, the tests that were used to assess
specific domains generally varied across studies. Second, only 3 of the 9 studies that we
reviewed defined ‘cognitive impairment,’ and the definition was not consistent across
studies. These issues make it difficult to compare results and develop firm conclusions from
the literature. In addition, these studies also have not proven a direct connection between
androgen ablation and cognition. Although there appear to be specific mechanisms for
testosterone to directly impact cognition, it is possible that the side effects of androgenablation therapy (eg, hot flashes, fatigue, and anemia) may contribute indirectly to impaired
cognition. Finally, all of these studies tend to use relatively small sample sizes (most likely
leading to reduced power), and the findings have not been entirely consistent across studies.
The most obvious example of this inconsistency occurred in the study by Joly et al, in which
no cognitive decline was reported after ablation therapy.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Despite these important considerations, when reviewing this literature as a whole, we
conclude from the data that androgen ablation does have implications for cognitive
functioning. Therefore, larger longitudinal studies are warranted. Larger studies should
explore the moderating/mediating implications of the side effects of ablation therapy (eg, hot
flashes, changes in mood, anemia) on cognitive functioning. In addition, future studies
should attempt to integrate brain imaging as a component of this research. In studies of the
cognitive effects of chemotherapy in women with breast cancer, brain imaging has provided
evidence of brain alteration; however, compensatory activation has allowed patients to
maintain performance on neuropsychological tasks.56 It is possible that neuropsychological
tests may not be sensitive enough to detect changes in cognitive functioning or may not test
the limits of cognitive function.56 Brain imaging may be useful to determine the extent of
the impact of androgen-ablation therapy on cognition. It is also important to consider the
clinical implications of these findings. It would be valuable for physicians who use androgen
ablation to treat men with prostate cancer to be aware of this relation so they can inform
patients and monitor them for possible side effects, as appropriate.
