Abstract
Leptin, a cytokine mainly produced by adipocytes, seems to
play a crucial role in mammary carcinogenesis. In the present
study, we explored the mechanism of leptin-mediated promotion of breast tumor growth using xenograft MCF-7 in 45-dayold female nude mice, and an in vitro model represented by
MCF-7 three-dimensional cultures. Xenograft tumors, obtained only in animals with estradiol (E2) pellet implants,
doubled control value after 13 weeks of leptin exposure. In
three-dimensional cultures, leptin and/or E2 enhanced cellcell adhesion. This increased aggregation seems to be
dependent on E-cadherin because it was completely abrogated
in the presence of function-blocking E-cadherin antibody or
EGTA, a calcium-chelating agent. In three-dimensional cultures, leptin and/or E2 treatment significantly increased cell
growth, which was abrogated when E-cadherin function was
blocked. These findings well correlated with an increase of
mRNA and protein content of E-cadherin in three-dimensional
cultures and in xenografts. In MCF-7 cells both hormones were
able to activate E-cadherin promoter. Mutagenesis studies,
electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that cyclic AMP–responsive element binding protein and Sp1 motifs, present on E-cadherin
promoter, were important for the up-regulatory effects
induced by both hormones on E-cadherin expression in breast
cancer MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, the present study shows
how leptin is able to promote tumor cell proliferation and
homotypic tumor cell adhesion via an increase of E-cadherin
expression. This combined effect may give reasonable emphasis to the important role of this cytokine in stimulating
primary breast tumor cell growth and progression, particularly in obese women. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3412–21]

Materials and Methods

Introduction
Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone (1) that, in addition to
the control weight homeostasis by regulating food intake and
energy expenditure (2, 3), is implicated in the modulation of many
other processes such as reproduction, lactation, hematopoiesis,

immune responses, cell differentiation, and proliferation (4, 5). The
activities of leptin are mediated through the transmembrane leptin
receptor (ObR; refs. 6, 7) by activation of the Janus-activated
kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)
and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (8, 9).
Epidemiologic studies show a positive association between obesity and an increased risk of developing different cancers (10, 11).
Several lines of evidence suggest that leptin and ObR are involved
in the development of normal mammary gland and in mammary
carcinogenesis (12–14). It has been recently reported that in
primary breast tumors, leptin was detected in 86.4% of cases
examined, and its expression was highly correlated with ObR (15).
This indicates that leptin can influence breast cancer cells not only
by endocrine and/or paracrine actions but also through autocrine
pathways.
In epithelium and epithelium-derived tumors, cell-cell adhesion
and tumor mass mostly depend on E-cadherin, a 120-kDa transmembrane molecule (16, 17). As it might be expected, E-cadherin
seems to have a major influence on primary cancer development
and evolution. Alteration in the function of E-cadherin and the
cadherin-catenin complex has been implicated in cancer progression (18), invasion (19–21), and metastasis (22, 23).
In this study, we explored a new aspect of the involvement of
leptin in initial steps of mammary tumorigenesis. Specifically, we
asked whether leptin can affect primary tumor mass either in vivo
in MCF-7 cell tumor xenograft or in vitro in MCF-7 threedimensional cultures. Our results showed that leptin is able to
promote tumor cell proliferation and homotypic tumor cell
adhesion via an increase of E-cadherin expression. These combined
effects may give reasonable emphasis to the important role of this
cytokine in stimulating local primary breast tumor cell growth and
progression, particularly in obese women.

Plasmids. The plasmids containing the human E-cadherin promoter or
its deletions were given by Dr. Y.S. Chang (Chang-Gung University, Republic
of China; ref. 24). pHEGO plasmid containing the full length of estrogen
receptor a (ERa) cDNA was provided by Dr. D. Picard (University of
Geneva). pSG5 vector containing the cDNA-encoding dominant-negative
STAT3, which is a variant of the transcription factor STAT3 lacking an
internal domain of 50 bp located near the COOH terminus (STAT ), was
given by Dr. J. Turkson (University of South Florida, College of Medicine,
Tampa, FL). pCMV5myc vector containing the cDNA-encoding dominantnegative extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 K52R (ERK2 ) was provided
by Dr. M. Cobb (Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX).
Site-directed mutagenesis. The E-cadherin promoter plasmid-bearing
cyclic AMP–responsive element binding protein (CREB)–mutated site
(CREB mut) was created by site-directed mutagenesis using Quick Change
kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). We used as template the human E-cadherin

promoter, and the mutagenic primers were as follows: 5¶-AGGGTGGATCACCTGAtacCAGGAGTTCCAGACCAGC-3¶ and 5¶-GCTGGTCTGGAACTCCTGgtaTCAGGTGATCCACCCT-3¶. The constructed reporter vector was
confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Cell lines and culture conditions. MCF-7, HeLa, and BT-20 cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MCF7 and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 containing 5% calf serum
and BT-20 cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1% Eagle’s nonessential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate
(Sigma, Milan, Italy). Cells were cultured in phenol red–free DMEM (serumfree medium), containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 24 h before each
experiment. All media were supplemented with 1% L-glutamine and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma).
In vivo studies. The experiments in vivo were done in 45-day-old female
nude mice (nu/nu Swiss; Charles River, Milan, Italy). At day 0, the animals
were fully anesthetized by i.m. injection of 1.0 mg/kg Zoletil (Virbac) and
0.12% Xylor (Xylazine) to allow the s.c. implantation of estradiol (E2) pellets
(1.7 mg per pellet, 60-day release; Innovative Research of America, Sarasota,
FL) into the intrascapular region of mice. The day after, exponentially
growing MCF-7 cells (5.0  106 per mouse) were inoculated s.c. in 0.1 mL of
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). Leptin treatment was started 24 h
later, when animals were injected i.p. with either solutions: recombinant
human leptin (230 Ag/kg) diluted in saline + 0.3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) or saline + 0.3% BSA only (control). The treatment was done for 5 days
a week until the 13th week. Tumor development was followed twice a week
by caliper measurements along two orthogonal axes: length (L) and width
(W). The volume (V ) of tumors was estimated by the following formula:
V = L  (W 2) / 2. At the time of killing (13 weeks), tumors were dissected out
from the neighboring connective tissue, frozen in nitrogen, and stored at
80jC. All the procedures involving animals and their care have been
conducted in conformity with the institutional guidelines at the Laboratory
of Molecular Oncogenesis, Regina Elena Cancer Institute in Rome.
Three-dimensional spheroid culture and cell growth. The cells were
plated in single-cell suspension in 2% agar–coated plates and untreated or
treated with 1,000 ng/mL leptin and/or 100 nmol/L E2 for 48 h. To block
E-cadherin function, the medium was supplemented with E-cadherin
antibody (1:100 dilution; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) or EGTA
to a final concentration of 4 mmol/L. To generate three-dimensional

spheroids, the plates were rotated for 4 h at 37jC. The three-dimensional
cultures were photographed using a phase-contrast microscope (Olympus,
Milan, Italy). The extent of aggregation was scored by measuring the
spheroids with an ocular micrometer. The spheroids between 25 and 50,
50 and 100, and >100 Am (in the smallest cross-section) were counted in
10 different fields under 10 magnification.
Cell number was determined, after trypsinization of spheroids, by direct
cell counting at 48 h of treatments.
E-cadherin adhesion assay. MCF-7 cells were pretreated with leptin
(1,000 ng/mL) and/or E2 (100 nmol/L) for 48 h and then plated on six-well
plates coated with 1.5 Ag/mL recombinant human E-cadherin/Fc chimeric.
Before the experiment, the wells were blocked with 1% BSA for 3 h at 37jC
and then washed with PBS.
After washing out nonadherent cells, adherent cells were incubated 3 h in
medium containing 500 Ag/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution. The reaction product was measured at 570 nm.
Total RNA extraction and reverse transcription-PCR assay. Total
RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA).
Reverse transcription was done using RETROscript kit (Ambion, Austin,
TX). The cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the following primers:
5¶-TCTAAGATGAAGGAGACCATC-3¶ and 5¶-GCGGTAGTAGGACAGGAAGTTGTT-3¶ (cyclin D1), 5¶-TGGAATCCAAGCAGAATTGC-3¶ and 5¶-TATGTGGCAATGCGTTCTCTATCCA-3¶ (E-cadherin), and 5¶-CTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTC-3¶ and 5¶-CAAATCCCATATCCTCGT-3¶ (36B4). The PCR was done
for 30 cycles for cyclin D1 (94jC for 1 min, 60jC for 1 min, and 72jC for
2 min) and E-cadherin (94jC for 1 min, 55jC for 1 min, and 72jC for 2 min)
and 15 cycles (94jC for 1 min, 59jC for 1 min, and 72jC for 2 min) to
amplify 36B4, in the presence of 1 AL of first-strand cDNA, 1 Amol/L each of
the primers mentioned above, deoxynucleotide triphosphate (0.5 mmol/L),
Taq DNA polymerase (2 units per tube; Promega, Madison, WI) in a final
volume of 25 AL.
Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of total protein were resolved on
an 8% to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the appropriated antibody. The
antigen-antibody complex was detected by incubation of the membrane at
room temperature with a peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse or antirabbit IgG and revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system
(Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).

Transfection assay. MCF-7 cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6
reagent (Promega) with the mixture containing 0.5 Ag of human E-cadherin
promoter constructs. HeLa cells were transfected with E-cadherin promoter
(0.5 Ag per well) in the presence or absence of HEGO (0.2 Ag per well) or
cotransfected with STAT3 or ERK2 dominant negative (0.5 Ag per well).
Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 1,000 ng/mL
leptin and/or 100 nmol/L E2 for 48 h. Empty vectors were used to ensure that
DNA concentrations were constant in each transfection. TK Renilla
luciferase plasmid (5 ng per well) was used. Firefly and Renilla luciferase
activities were measured by Dual Luciferase kit. The firefly luciferase data for
each sample were normalized based on the transfection efficiency measured
by Renilla luciferase activity.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared
from MCF-7 as previously described (25). The probe was generated by
annealing single-stranded oligonucleotides, labeled with [g32P]ATP and T4
polynucleotide kinase, and then purified using Sephadex G50 spin columns.
The DNA sequences used as probe or as cold competitors are as follows:
CRE, 5¶-TGGATCACCTGAGGTCAGGAGTTCCAGACC-3¶; Sp1, 5¶-ATCAGCGGTACGGGGGGCGGTGCTCCGGGG-3¶. In vitro transcribed and translated
CREB protein was synthesized using the T7 polymerase in the rabbit
reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The protein-binding reactions were
carried out in 20 mL of buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 8), 1 mmol/L EDTA,
50 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/mL BSA, 50 Ag/mL
poly(dI/dC) with 50,000 cpm] of labeled probe, 20 Ag of MCF-7 nuclear
protein or an appropriate amount of CREB protein or Sp1 human
recombinant protein (Promega), and 5 Ag of poly(dI-dC). The mixtures
were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in the presence or absence
of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. The specificity of the binding was
tested by adding to the mixture reaction–specific antibodies (anti-CREB
and anti-Sp1). Mithramycin A (100 Amol/L; ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa
Mesa, CA) was incubated with the labeled probe for 30 min at 4jC before
the addition of nuclear extracts. The entire reaction mixture was
electrophoresed through a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 Tris borateEDTA for 3 h at 150 V.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We followed chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) methodology described by Morelli et al. (26).
MCF-7 cells were untreated or treated with 1,000 ng/mL leptin and/or 100
nmol/L E2 for 1 h. The cells were then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde
and sonicated. Supernatants were immunocleared with sonicated salmon
DNA/protein A agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and
immunoprecipitated with anti-CREB or anti-Sp1 antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Pellets were washed as reported (26), eluted

Results
Effects of leptin on breast cancer cell tumor growth. To
determine in vivo the influence of leptin on breast cancer cell
tumor growth, we used 45-day-old female nude mice bearing, into
the intrascapular region, MCF-7 cell tumor xenografts with or
without estrogen pellets. Tumors were obtained only in animals
with estrogen pellet implants, which were in general larger in
animals treated with leptin at the dose of 230 Ag/kg (Fig. 1A).
Particularly, 13 weeks of leptin parenteral administration increased
the tumor volume to 100% the size of E2 treatment. Besides, leptin
significantly enhanced phosphorylation of tumor-derived MAPK
and STAT3, suggesting that concentration and dosing schedule of
leptin were appropriated for in vivo stimulation (Fig. 1B and C).
Leptin enhances cell-cell adhesion and cell proliferation. We
did three-dimensional MCF-7 cultures to evaluate in vitro the
effects of leptin on cell aggregation. It has been reported that
multicellular spheroid culture can more closely mimic some in vivo
biological features of tumors and improve the relevance of in vitro
studies (27–30).
Our results evidenced that leptin and/or E2 treatment for
48 h enhances cell-cell adhesion of MCF-7 cells compared with
untreated cells (Fig. 2A). The combined exposure to both hormones
switches cell aggregation towards the formation of spheroids
exhibiting prevalently a diameter larger than 100 Am (Table 1).
E-cadherin is a major type of adhesion molecule, which forms
Ca2+-dependent homophilic ligations to facilitate cell-cell contact
in epithelial cells (16, 17). Thus, to study whether E-cadherin was
responsible for leptin-enhanced cell-cell adhesion, we supplemented the cell culture medium with function-blocking E-cadherin
antibody or EGTA, a calcium-chelating agent. As shown in Fig. 2A,
in the presence of the antibody, MCF-7 cells formed small
aggregates showing limited intercellular contact, whereas EGTA
treatment prevented cell-cell adhesion, and cells remained rounded
and singled suspended.
In addition, the role of E-cadherin was confirmed using an
adhesion assay in which cells were allowed to adhere to Ecadherin/Fc protein–coated dishes. This assay showed a greater
binding of cells pretreated with leptin and/or E2 for 48 h with
respect to untreated cells (Fig. 2B). The adhesion was blocked using
either a function-blocking E-cadherin antibody or EGTA (data not
shown). Thus, the increased aggregation observed in the presence
of leptin and/or E2 was dependent on E-cadherin.
In three-dimensional cultures, we also observed a significant
increase of cell growth upon leptin and/or E2 treatment. The
leptin-induced cell proliferation was completely abrogated when
E-cadherin function was blocked (Fig. 2C).
Furthermore, in MCF-7 spheroids and in xenografts, we observed
an increase of cyclin D1, a regulator of cell cycle progression, in
terms of mRNA and protein content in the presence of leptin and/
or E2 (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Leptin up-regulates E-cadherin expression. To investigate if
an enhanced expression of E-cadherin occurred in the abovementioned conditions, we did reverse transcription-PCR and
Western blotting analysis. Our results showed that either leptin
or E2 and, in higher extent, the exposure to both hormones
increased expression of E-cadherin in terms of mRNA and protein
content (Fig. 3A). The latter results were also evident in MCF-7
xenografts (Fig. 3B).
To evaluate whether both hormones were able to activate Ecadherin promoter, we transiently transfected MCF-7 cells with
human E-cadherin promoter plasmid (p-1008/+49). A significant
increase in promoter activity was observed in the transfected cells
exposed to leptin and/or E2 for 48 h (Fig. 3C).
In contrast, we observed that leptin was unable to activate the
constructs containing different deleted segments of human Ecadherin promoter (p-164/+49 and p-83/+49) with respect to the
full length, whereas E2 induced activation in the presence of p-164/
+49 construct (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Leptin enhances CREB-DNA and Sp1-DNA binding activity
to E-cadherin promoter. The role of leptin and E2 on the transcriptional activity of the E-cadherin gene was explored analyzing
the nucleotide sequence of the E-cadherin gene promoter. We
evidenced, upstream to the initiation transcription site, one CRE
( 925/ 918) and two Sp1 ( 144/ 132 and 51/ 39) as putative
effectors of leptin and estrogens. For instance, in MCF-7 cells
transiently transfected with E-cadherin promoter plasmid-bearing
CREB-mutated site (CREB mut), we observed that the stimulatory
effect of leptin was abrogated, whereas the activation of E2 still
persisted, although in a lower extent with respect to the intact
promoter (Fig. 3D).
To characterize the role of these motifs in modulating E-cadherin
promoter activity, we did electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
Nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells, using as probe a CRE-responsive
element, showed two protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 4A, lane 1), which
were abolished by the addition of a nonradiolabeled competitor
(Fig. 4A, lane 2). Leptin treatment induced a strong increase in CREB
DNA-binding activity (Fig. 4A, lane 3), which was immunodepleted in
the presence of CREB antibody (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Using transcribed and
translated in vitro CREB protein, we obtained two bands migrating
at the same level as that of MCF-7 nuclear extracts (Fig. 4A, lane 9).
In the presence of the MAPK inhibitor PD98059, the complex induced
by leptin treatment was reduced (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 9). These
findings addressed a specific involvement of leptin signaling in the
up-regulation of E-cadherin expression.
Using a DNA probe containing an Sp1 site, we observed in MCF7 nuclear extracts, a specific protein-DNA complex that was slightly
enhanced by leptin, increased upon E2 exposure and furthermore
by the combined treatments (Fig. 4C, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). In the
presence of Sp1 human recombinant protein, we observed a single
complex that causes the same shift with respect to the band
revealed in MCF-7 nuclear extracts (Fig. 4C, lane 10). The addition

a double-stranded CREB-specific (A and B) or Sp1-specific (C and D ) consensus sequence probe labeled with [g-32P]ATP and subjected to electrophoresis in a 6%
polyacrylamide gel (lane 1). A, we used as positive control a transcribed and translated in vitro CREB protein (lane 9 ). Competition experiments were done by adding
as competitor a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe (lanes 2 and 10 ). MCF-7 nuclear extracts treated with 1,000 ng/mL leptin (Lep ) and/or 100 nmol/L E2
for 48 h incubated with probe (lanes 3, 5 , and 7, respectively). The specificity of the binding was tested by adding to the reaction mixture a CREB antibody (lanes 4, 6,
and 8). B, MCF-7 cells were serum starved overnight with 10 Amol/L PD 98059 (lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9). Lanes 11 (A) and 12 (B) contain probe alone. C, Sp1
human recombinant protein was used as positive control (lane 10). Competition experiments were done by adding as competitor a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled
probe (lanes 2 and 11). MCF-7 nuclear extracts treated with 1,000 ng/mL leptin and/or 100 nmol/L E2 for 48 h incubated with probe (lanes 3, 5, and 7 , respectively).
The specificity of the binding was tested by adding to the reaction mixture a Sp1 antibody (lanes 4, 6 , and 8 ). The formation of DNA-Sp1 complexes was blocked
by the addition of 100 Amol/L mithramycin A (lane 9 ). D, the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (1 Amol/L) was added in leptin-treated (lane 5 ) and/or E2-treated (lanes 7
and 9) MCF-7 nuclear extracts. Lane 12 contain probe alone.

of mithramycin A (100 Amol/L), which binds to GC boxes and
prevents sequential Sp1 binding, to nuclear extracts treated with
leptin and E2 blocked the formation of DNA-Sp1 complexes
(Fig. 4C, lane 9). The original band DNA-protein complex was
supershifted by Sp1 antibody (Fig. 4C, lanes 4, 6, and 8). In all
hormonal treatments done, the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780
reduced the Sp1-DNA binding complex (Fig. 4D, lanes 5, 7, and 9),
evidencing that leptin induced an activation of ERa, as we
previously showed (25).
Effects of leptin on CREB and Sp1 recruitment to the
E-cadherin promoter. To corroborate EMSA results, we did ChIP
assay. We found that the stimulation of MCF-7 cells with leptin
increased the recruitment of CREB to E-cadherin gene promoter
(Fig. 5A). Furthermore, we observed that leptin or E2 stimulated the
recruitment of Sp1 to the E-cadherin promoter, and the combined
treatment induced an additive effect (Fig. 5B). The latter event
suggests that leptin and E2 may converge in activating ERa to
recruit Sp1 on E-cadherin promoter.
Involvement of ERA in the leptin-induced up-regulation of
E-cadherin expression. Stemming from the data provided by
EMSA and ChIP assays, we evaluated the involvement of ERa in the
enhanced E-cadherin expression induced by leptin. Our results
showed that in three-dimensional cultures, in the presence of the
pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780, the up-regulatory effect of leptin on
E-cadherin protein expression still persisted, whereas the stimulatory effects of E2 was abrogated (Fig. 6A).
In addition, the specific role of leptin signaling in up-regulating
E-cadherin expression was also confirmed by functional studies in
ERa-negative HeLa cells. We evidenced that leptin was able to
activate E-cadherin promoter (Fig. 6B), which was abrogated in
the presence of ERK2 and STAT3 dominant negative (Fig. 6C),
sustaining furthermore the involvement of leptin signaling. It is
worth to note how the ectopic expression of ERa in HeLa cells
was able to potentiate the effect of leptin (Fig. 6B). To test the
activity of the transfected ERa, we did Western blotting analysis
for phosphorylated ERa, whereas for dominant-negative ERK2
and STAT3 genes, we evaluated the expression of c-fos, as target
of both pathways (31–33). Moreover, in BT-20 cells lacking of
ERa, leptin-enhanced E-cadherin protein content was reduced in
the presence of either ERK2 or STAT3 dominant negative. In the
same cells, cotransfected with ERa and ERK2 or STAT3 dominant
negative, E2 alone or in combination with leptin was unable to
maintain the up-regulatory effect on E-cadherin expression
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

Discussion
Leptin stimulates cell growth, counteracts apoptosis, and
induces migration and angiogenic factors in different cellular
cancer models (10). For instance, hyperleptinemia is a common
feature of obese women who have a higher risk of breast cancer
than women with normal weight (34), but the association between
circulating leptin and breast cancer is still not clear. It has been
reported that in interstitial fluid of the adipose tissue, leptin
concentration is higher than the circulating levels (35). Thus, we
may reasonably assume that in the presence of an abundant
adipose tissue surrounding epithelial breast cancer cells, the
paracrine leptin effects become crucial in affecting local and
primary tumor progression.
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether leptin can
influence local primary breast cancer development and progres-

immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies [i.e., anti-CREB for CREB
immunoprecipitates (A) or anti-Sp1 for Sp1 immunoprecipitates (B)]. E-cadherin
promoter sequences containing CREB or Sp1 sites were detected by PCR
with specific primers, as detailed in Materials and Methods. To determine input
DNA, the E-cadherin promoter fragment was amplified from 5 AL purified
soluble chromatin before immunoprecipitation. PCR products obtained at
30 cycles. ChIP with non-immune IgG was used as negative control (C ). This

sion, using an in vivo model of MCF-7 xenografts implanted in
female nude mice and an in vitro system represented by MCF-7
three-dimensional cultures. Our results showed in MCF-7 xenografts that leptin treatment significantly potentiated the E2increased tumor size. In the same view, in vitro studies revealed
that the combined exposure to both hormones enhanced cell-cell
aggregation with respect to the separate treatments.
E-cadherin is an intercellular adhesion molecule generally
implicated as tumor suppressor in several types of epithelial
tumors, based on findings that the expression of this homotypic
adhesion molecule is frequently lost in human epithelial cancers
(18, 20, 21). However, it has well been shown in ovarian epithelial
tumors that E-cadherin expression is much more elevated than
normal ovaries, suggesting that E-cadherin can play a role in the
development of ovarian carcinomas (36). For instance, it is worth
to mention that E-cadherin may serve not only as an intercellular
adhesion molecule, but it may also trigger intracellular activation
of proliferation and survival signals (37).

Leptin and E-cadherin Expression in Breast Cancer

In our study, the increased cell-cell aggregation, observed in
MCF-7 three-dimensional cultures upon leptin and/or E2 treatments, seems to be dependent on E-cadherin molecule that has an
indispensable role in this process. Indeed, the addition of a
function-blocking E-cadherin antibody or a calcium-chelating agent
(EGTA) blocked cell-cell adhesion induced by both hormones.
Besides, we showed by adhesion assay a greater binding of cells
pretreated with leptin and/or E2 on E-cadherin/Fc protein–coated
dishes.
In the same experimental conditions, an increased proliferative
rate was observed upon leptin or E2 exposure, which was
completely abrogated when E-cadherin function was blocked.
An important cell cycle regulator, such as cyclin D1, resulted to
be up-regulated in three-dimensional cultures and in xenografts.
Besides, in both models, we showed that leptin and/or E2
enhanced E-cadherin expression in terms of mRNA, protein
content, and promoter activity.
The analysis of E-cadherin promoter sequence revealed the
presence of CRE and Sp1 sites as potential target of leptin and E2
signals. It is well documented how leptin and E2 through
nongenomic effects are able to activate the MAPK pathway that
induces activation of CREB kinase, a member of the p90RSK family
that corresponds to RSK2 and thereby phosphorylates CREB Ser133
(38–40). This well fits with our functional studies showing that
leptin was no longer able to activate the E-cadherin gene promoter
mutated in the CREB site, whereas E2 maintained an activatory

effect although in a lower extent with respect to the intact
promoter. The latter data suggest that the activatory effect of E2
may persist through its binding to Sp1-DNA complex.
The important role of the Sp1-responsive element in activating
E-cadherin promoter was shown by EMSA and ChIP assays. Our
results evidenced that E2, as extensively documented, acts in a
nonclassic way through the interaction of ERa with Sp1 (41–45). It
is worth to note that upon leptin exposure, we also observed an
increase in Sp1-DNA binding activity, clearly reduced in the
presence of the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780, as well as an
enhanced recruitment of Sp1 to E-cadherin promoter. These
observations are supported by our previous findings reporting that
leptin is able to transactivate, in a unliganded-dependent manner,
ERa through MAPK signal (25).
A cross-talk between leptin and E2 has been well documented
in neoplastic mammary tissues and breast cancer cell lines (15, 25,
46, 47). For instance, E2 up-regulates leptin expression in MCF-7
cells (15), whereas leptin is an amplifier of E2 signaling through a
double mechanism: an enhanced aromatase gene expression (46)
and a direct transactivation of ERa (25). Thus, we investigated
whether the up-regulatory effect induced by leptin on E-cadherin
expression can be modulated by ERa. We found that E-cadherin
protein seems up-regulated still by leptin in the presence of the
pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780. Moreover, in HeLa cells, leptin was
able to activate E-cadherin promoter, which was abrogated in the
presence of ERK2 or STAT3 dominant negative, suggesting that

Figure 7. Hypothesized model of leptin signaling in modulating E-cadherin
expression in breast cancer. Interaction of leptin (Lep ) with its specific receptor
(ObR) induces, through MAPK activation, phosphorylation of CREB and its
transactivation. Leptin may potentiate the transactivation of ERa, which in turn
may interact with Sp1 and bind DNA in a nonclassic way. Both CREB and Sp1
transcriptional factors bind on E-cadherin promoter at specific responsive
sequences and induce an enhanced E-cadherin expression.

leptin signaling is involved in enhancing E-cadherin expression.
These latter data are supported by Western blotting analysis done
in BT-20 cells lacking of ERa in which ERK2 and STAT3 dominant
negative reversed leptin-enhanced E-cadherin protein content.
The up-regulatory effect induced by E2 on E-cadherin expression in
the presence of ectopic ERa seemed inhibited in the presence of
ERK2 and STAT3 dominant negative. The latter findings may be a

consequence of the enhanced expression of leptin receptor upon E2
exposure (15), which may have an impaired signaling on E-cadherin
expression. An additional explanation, which could coexist with
the previous one, may be that both ERK2 and STAT3 dominant
negative could interfere with ERa-Sp1 interaction at level of Ecadherin gene transcription (48).
A hypothetical model of the possible mechanism through which
leptin and E2 may functionally interact in modulating E-cadherin
expression in breast cancer is shown in Fig. 7. Leptin through
MAPK activation may phosphorylate CREB and induce its transactivation. For instance, CREB phosphorylated at Ser133 is often
reported not only as an index of PKA but also as an effector of
MAPK activation (49). Concomitantly, leptin in the presence of
E2 may potentiate the transactivation of ERa, which in turn may
interact with Sp1 and bind DNA in a nonclassic way. On the other
hand, it is well known that ERa, in the presence of its natural
ligand, interacts with Sp1.
Thus, we may reasonably propose that upon leptin exposure, the
increased E-cadherin–mediated cellular adhesion and activation of
proliferation signals may enhance the transformation of normal
epithelial cells to neoplastic cells and then stimulate the growth of
tumor mass. Distinct from its role as a tumor suppressor, Ecadherin may function as tumor enhancer in the development of
primary breast cancer.
In conclusion, all these data address how leptin and E2 signaling
may represent a target of combined pharmacologic tools to be
exploited in the novel therapeutic adjuvant strategies for breast
cancer treatment particularly in obese women.
