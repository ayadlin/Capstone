BACKGROUND. To the authors’ knowledge, there is no effective therapy for extrahepatic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In a pilot study, the results
of combination therapy of S-1, a novel oral dehydropyrimidine dehydrogenase
(DPD) inhibitor, and interferon-alpha (IFN-a) are reported for HCC patients with
extrahepatic metastasis.

METHODS. Twelve patients with extrahepatic metastasis of HCC were enrolled in
the pilot study. S-1 was administered orally at a dose based on body surface area,
twice daily after a meal, for 4 weeks. IFN-a was injected subcutaneously on Days
1, 3, and 5 of each week. One course consisted of consecutive administration for
28 days followed by 14 days rest.
RESULTS. An objective response was observed in 3 (25%) of 12 patients. The overall 1-year survival rate was 61.7%. Grade 3 leukocytopenia was observed in 1

ith over 600,000 new cancer cases reported per year, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer in
the world.1 In the U.S., cirrhosis is expected to develop in 20% to
30% of approximately 3 million carriers of hepatitis C virus (HCV),
and HCC is likely to develop in 3% to 5% each year in the latter
group.2 Recent progress in diagnostic modalities and several effective locoregional treatments can control intrahepatic recurrences
and improve survival, such as repeated hepatectomy, transcatheter
arterial embolization (TAE), percutaneous ethanol injection therapy,
microwave coagulation therapy, and radiofrequency ablation.3–8
However, longer survival may lead to increased incidence of extrahepatic metastasis; once extrahepatic metastasis occurs the prognosis is limited to extremely poor.9–11 Many clinicians do not routinely
offer chemotherapy for metastatic patients because nothing has
definitively been demonstrated to improve survival in this setting;
several investigators consider that any extrahepatic metastasis of
HCC is a contraindication for further treatment and prefer to use

palliative treatment only.11,12 In selected patients,
surgical resection for metastatic lesions might be
beneficial.13,14 Unfortunately, however, most patients
with extrahepatic metastases of HCC are not candidates for surgery due to multiple tumor spreading
and/or poor liver function caused by underlying
chronic liver disease. Although chemotherapy is often used for such advanced-stage solid neoplasms, a
large number of controlled and uncontrolled studies
have reported that the response rates were low and
the response duration was typically short for HCC
over a long time.15,16 At the 2007 American Society of
Clinical Oncology meeting, the result of the Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol (SHARP)
study was reported by Dr. Josep Llovet; the patients
who received sorafenib demonstrated a 3-month
benefit in overall survival for those with advanced
HCC without any severe toxicity. To our knowledge,
this study reported the first systemic therapy proven
to demonstrate a large survival benefit in HCC.17
Conversely, recently we and others reported the
clinical effects of combination chemotherapy of the
intra-arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and
subcutaneous interferon-alpha (IFN-a) injection for
HCC with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).18–22
However, this combined treatment would not be
expected to have a clinical effect on extrahepatic metastasis because 5-FU was given through the hepatic
artery. In this study, we tried the systemic combination therapy of S-1, a novel oral combination anticancer drug that consists of tegafur and 2 modulators,
and IFN-a for HCC patients with extrahepatic metastasis as a pilot trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients between 20 and 75 years of age with a radiologic or histopathologic diagnosis of extrahepatic
metastasis of HCC were eligible. The diagnosis was
based on serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) and serum protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II
(PIVKA-II) and imaging techniques including a computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cases with PVTT and/or
hepatic vein tumor thrombosis were excluded. The
patients who had history of psychologic disease were
excluded to avoid severe depression because of the
side effects of IFN in this study. Other inclusion criteria were 1) an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status (PS) 2; 2) a life expectancy of
12 weeks; 3) measurable or assessable disease; 4)
no prior therapy at least 28 days before registration;
5) adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobin 8.0

g/dL, leukocyte count between 2500 and 12,000/lL,
platelet count 80,000/lL); and 6) adequate hepatic
and renal reserve (total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase
100 IU/L, blood urea nitrogen 30 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL). All patients signed
informed consent approved by the Institutional
Review Board attesting to the finding that they were
aware of the investigational nature of the study and
were willing to try the combination therapy.

Treatment Regimen
S-1 (Taiho Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) was administered orally twice daily after a meal at a total dose
of 80 mg/m2. Three initial doses of S-1 were established according to body surface area (BSA) as follows: <1.25 m2, 80 mg/day; 1.25 to <1.5 m2, 100
mg/day; and 1.5 m2, 120 mg/day. IFN-a (OIF,
Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan; at a dose of 5
3 106 U [5 MU]/body) was injected subcutaneously
on Days 1, 3, and 5 of each week. One course consisted of consecutive administration for 28 days followed by at least 14 days of rest. Diclofenac sodium,
a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, was administered before IFN-a injection to alleviate fever, which
is a common adverse effect of IFN-a.
Assessment of Toxicity
Blood counts and biochemical profiles were performed at least once every 2 weeks. We monitored
patients for the occurrence of nonhematologic toxicities such as general fatigue, fever, nausea/vomiting,
stomatitis, diarrhea, skin pigmentation, eczema,
hand-foot syndrome, and especially depression. Toxicity during each course was evaluated according to
the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (vesion 2.0).
Assessment of Response
Lesions before and after treatment and once every 3
months thereafter were measured or evaluated by CT
and/or MRI. Objective responses were classified
according to World Health Organziation (WHO) criteria23 into complete response (CR), partial response
(PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease
(PD). In addition to serum chemistry, tumor markers
such as a-fetoprotein and protein induced by vitamin K antagonist or absence (PIVKA-II) were measured at least once every 4 weeks.
Statistical Analysis
Survival curves were constructed using the KaplanMeier method24 and compared using the log-rank
test. Significance was interpreted as P < .05.

DISCUSSION

TABLE 1
Patient Characteristics

Adverse Effects
All 12 patients were assessable for toxicity (Table 4).
With regard to the hematologic toxicity, toxicity
greater than grade 3 was observed in only 1 patient
(8.3%), and grade 3 leukocytopenia did not require
withdrawal or reduction of the dose of either drug.
None of the patients required treatment with granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor or other similar
therapies. Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent
adverse effect but it was grade 1 in all 3 patients.
Severe nonhematologic toxicities, including adverse
effects greater than grade 3, were not observed.
Grade 1 fever was noted in 4 patients (33.3%), but it
was well controlled with antipyretic agents. There
was no need for discontinuation of the combination
therapy because of adverse effect and no treatmentrelated deaths were reported during this study.

Clinical Response
The effect of combination therapy was evaluated in
all 12 patients. Table 2 lists the overall and site-specific responses to the treatment classified according to
WHO criteria. Three of the 12 patients (25%) demonstrated objective response, whereas another 3
patients were found to have SD over 6 months. With
respect to survival, the overall 1-year survival was
61.7% (Fig. 1). Change in tumor markers before and
after 2 treatment courses are listed in Table 3. All

Patient Characteristics
Twelve patients with extrahepatic metastasis of HCC
were enrolled in this pilot study between January
2003 and September 2006. Table 1 lists the patient
characteristics. Patient age ranged from 22 to 71
years. Ten of the 12 patients had viral hepatitis. Eleven patients had received prior therapies: combination chemotherapy of intra-arterial 5-FU infusion
and subcutaneous IFN-a injection (IFN-a/5-FU) in 7
patients, TAE in 4 patients, oral tegafur-uracil (UFT)
in 2 patients, combination of interferon-b and doxorubicin (Adriamycin) (ADR/IFN-b) in 1 patient, and
radiotherapy in 1 patient. These therapies were
stopped at least 28 days before treatment. All
patients had undergone surgery for HCC. The mean
number of treatment cycles was 3 (range, 2–12
cycles).

and subcutaneous injection of IFN-a was applied for
advanced HCC with distant metastasis. Recently, we
and others reported the clinical effects of combination chemotherapy of intra-arterial infusion of 5-FU
and subcutaneous IFN-a injection for HCC with
PVTT.18–22 In HCC, PVTT can cause liver failure and
most patients die within several months after diagnosis; no treatment is available for these patients.
IFN-a/5-FU therapy demonstrated excellent clinical
effect, with an approximately 50% response rate.
However, patients with extrahepatic metastasis of
HCC were not included in the indication of this combination therapy because they were not expected to
respond to such treatment. With regard to extrahepatic metastasis of HCC, we previously reported a
case with uncontrollable multiple lung and bone metastases that demonstrated nearly complete regression after treatment with UFT and IFN-a; the patient
remained alive for 7 years after the first occurrence
of extrahepatic metastasis.25 UFT is a combination
drug of 1M of 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-FU (Tegafur, a
prodrug of 5-FU) and 4M uracil, an inhibitor of
DPD.26 DPD is a metabolic enzyme of 5-FU and DPD
inhibitors are expected to result in long-term elevation of serum and tissue 5-FU concentrations and a
rise in the antitumor effect of 5-FU by RNA dysfunction and damage to DNA synthesis.
S-1 is a novel oral combination anticancer drug
that consists of tegafur and 2 modulators, 5-chloro-2,
4 dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium oxonate
(Oxo) at a molecular ratio of 1:0.4:1.27 CDHP is a
more effective DPD inhibitor than uracil (reported
approximately 200 times in vitro), and strongly blocks
5-FU metabolites.28 Oxo is a reversible competitive inhibitor of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and is
reported to concentrate selectively in gastrointestinal
tissues after oral administration and suppresses gastrointestinal toxicity induced by phosphoribosylation of
5-FU in the gastrointestinal tract without reducing

antitumor activity.29,30 These features provide S-1 with
high efficacy and low toxicity.30 Moreover, S-1 is an
oral anticancer agent, thus having a great advantage
for administration without the need for hospitalization. In Japan, S-1 is widely used for the treatment of
gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer,
neck cancer, cervical cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer,
and breast cancer, and excellent antitumor activity has
been reported.32,33
In the current study, 25% of the patients
responded to S-1/IFN-a combination therapy and
another 25% of patients demonstrated SD over 6
months. All patients who demonstrated PR/SD survived greater than 1 year, including 2 SDs achieved
over 30 months. These survival rates and times were
higher and longer than the other results previously
reported.10,11 The response rate and survival rate to
doxorubicin, a major anticancer agent for solid
tumors, were 3.3% and 10.6 weeks, respectively,
whereas those to capecitabine, another oral chemotherapeutic agent, were 11%.34,35 The reported
response rate in phase 2 studies of other systemic
chemotherapies, such as CPT-11, paclitaxel, and
gemcitabine were 7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively.36–38
Other therapies including combination chemotherapy were also considered ineffective or minimally
and of uncertain effectiveness.15,16,39 A clinical
response rate was not negligible, which might lead
patients to take a chance to receive further therapies,
such as a surgical procedure; these further therapies
might play a role in prolonging survival.
The exact mechanism of the excellent clinical efficacy of the combination chemotherapy of S-1/IFNa for HCC is not clear at present. First, the combination of fluorouracil, which is an antitumor component of S-1, and IFN-a demonstrated the strongest

synergistic antitumor effect in vitro among several
combinations of chemotherapies.40 Moreover, the
synergistic antitumor effect of fluorouracil and IFN-a
most likely involves several mechanisms such as
direct cell arrest effect, apoptosis, and immunomodulatory effect via TRAIL/TRAIL receptor or Fas/FasL
system.41–44 We also performed molecular analysis to
predict the clinical antitumor effect.45 In addition,
we have reported that the expression level of IFN receptor is important for the clinical effect of IFN-arelated therapy.22,46 In this regard the expression level
of the IFN receptor is higher in HCC cells than in
other gastrointestinal cancers.47 Finally, the concentrations of fluorouracil in peripheral circulation and
tumor tissue might be increased with the effect of a
strong DPD inhibitor, CDHP. In Cases 1 and 2, the

1770

CANCER

lesions in the remnant liver demonstrated complete
remission with S-1 and IFN-a, although both cases
were resistant to the combination treatment of intraarterial infusion of 5-FU and IFN-a.48,49 These observations suggest that orally administered S-1 could
maintain higher 5-FU concentrations than intra-arterial infusion of 5-FU alone.
The combination therapy was associated with
tolerable adverse effects despite the underlying
chronic liver disease. The myelosuppressive effects of
chemotherapy are particularly important in HCC.
This is not only because thrombocytopenia and/or
leukocytopenia are often present before the initiation
of anticancer therapy, but also because treatment often has to be discontinued because of these side
effects. In the present study, only 1 patient was
found to have grade 3 leukocytopenia but it was well
controlled without any treatment. Severe thrombocytopenia was not observed in these 12 patients,
although nearly all patients had liver dysfunction.
Thrombocytopenia was most likely the result of the
use of IFN-a. Previous studies reported that nonhematologic toxicity, fever, chilliness, and a flu-like syndrome were observed in 50% to 100% of patients
receiving IFN-a-related chemotherapy, and was 1 of
the reasons for treatment discontinuation.22,50 In our
study, such toxicities were well controlled with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs administration
before IFN-a injection. Other side effects were also
well controlled by conventional treatment. Depression
due to IFN-a is a very critical adverse effect because
it could lead to suicide, but it was not observed in our
patients. The relatively mild nature of the observed
side effects allowed continuation of treatment, and
may enhance the marked clinical effect because treatment was never interrupted because of adverse
effects. All patients could maintain their social life
while receiving S-1/IFN-a therapy.
All 12 patients enrolled in this study had undergone surgery and had preserved liver function; it is
difficult to determine whether this regimen would
work as well in those with more compromised liver
function. Because this study was experimental and a
pilot application, and patient safety must be promised, we set strict exclusion criteria, including liver
function, for the eligibility criteria. There was no
need for discontinuation of the combination therapy
because of adverse effects and no treatment-related
deaths in this study. To set the exact and appropriate
inclusion criteria, a phase 1 clinical trial is necessary.
In conclusion, the combination chemotherapy of
oral S-1 and subcutaneous IFN-a is a potentially promising strategy for patients with advanced HCC with
extrahepatic metastasis.
