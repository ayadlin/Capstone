Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells are potent immune effector cells capable of mediating antitumor responses. Thus,
during immunoediting, tumor cell populations evolve strategies to escape NK-cell–mediated recognition. In this
study, we report a novel mechanism of immune escape involving tumor cell shedding of B7-H6, a ligand for the
activating receptor NKp30 that mediates NK-cell binding and NK-cell–mediated killing. Tumor cells from
different cancer entities released B7-H6 by ectodomain shedding mediated by the cell surface proteases "a
disintegrin and metalloproteases" (ADAM)-10 and ADAM-17, as demonstrated through the use of pharmacologic
inhibitors or siRNA-mediated gene attenuation. Inhibiting this proteolytic shedding process increased the levels
of B7-H6 expressed on the surface of tumor cells, enhancing NKp30-mediated activation of NK cells. Notably, we
documented elevated levels of soluble B7-H6 levels in blood sera obtained from a subset of patients with
malignant melanoma, compared with healthy control individuals, along with evidence of elevated B7-H6
expression in melanoma specimens in situ. Taken together, our results illustrated a novel mechanism of immune
escape in which tumor cells impede NK-mediated recognition by metalloprotease-mediated shedding of B7-H6.
One implication of our ﬁndings is that therapeutic inhibition of speciﬁc metalloproteases may help support
NK-cell–based cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 74(13); 3429–40. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Natural killer (NK)-cell activation is determined by a delicate
balance of signals received via inhibitory and activating receptors (1–3). Inhibitory receptors mainly recognize self-MHC
class I molecules. Activating receptors, such as natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR), or NKG2D, interact with virus-,
stress-, transformation-, or senescence-inducible ligands
(1, 4, 5). These ligands are normally not expressed on the cell
surface of healthy cells. Tumor cells frequently express high
levels of activating NK-cell receptor ligands and low levels of

MHC class I rendering these cells highly susceptible to NK-cell–
mediated lysis (6).
The family of NCRs comprises three members, NKp30 (7),
NKp44, and NKp46, all of which are involved in the killing of
tumor cells (7, 8). Recently, B7-H6 (natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3 ligand 1, NR3LG1) was identiﬁed as a tumor
cell surface–expressed ligand for NKp30 (natural cytotoxicity
triggering receptor 3, NCR3; ref. 9). Neither NKp30 nor B7-H6
orthologues exist in mice. B7-H6 is a 454-aa-long type I
transmembrane protein with a predicted molecular weight of
51 kDa belonging to the B7 family (9). The extracellular domain
of B7-H6 comprises two immunoglobulin-like domains and
harbors several potential N-glycosylation sites (9, 10). The
interaction of B7-H6 on tumor cells with NKp30 on NK cells
leads to efﬁcient NK-cell activation and target cell killing (9). To
date, B7-H6 expression was found on tumor cell lines or
monocytes and neutrophils after inﬂammatory stimulation
and has not been detected on healthy cells (9, 11, 12). So far,
mechanisms regulating B7-H6 expression on tumor cells are
still poorly explored. To evaluate B7-H6 as a potential target for
tumor therapy, it is crucial to obtain an in-depth understanding about its expression and regulation.
Release of soluble ligands for the activating NK-cell receptor
NKG2D has been implied in immune escape mechanisms of
tumor cells from NK- or T-cell–mediated killing (13, 14). The
release of soluble NKG2D ligands was described to be either
mediated by proteases and/or by exosomal secretion (15–21).

Schlecker et al.

In several studies, soluble NKG2D ligands were shown to
downregulate NKG2D expression on effector T and NK cells
impairing their cytotoxic potential against NKG2D ligand–
expressing target cells (15, 22, 23). Elevated levels of soluble
NKG2D ligands were detectable in sera of patients with cancer
and were found to correlate with advanced disease (23–26) or
poor clinical outcome (23, 27) in certain malignancies.
Our initial observation that certain tumor cell lines
expressed comparably high B7-H6 mRNA levels but showed
only low cell-surface B7-H6 protein expression, led us to search
for posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of B7-H6
expression on tumor cells. In our study, we identiﬁed ectodomain shedding of B7-H6 by the metalloproteases "a disintegrin
and metalloproteases" (ADAM)-10 and ADAM-17 from the
cell surface of tumor cells as a crucial mechanism of expression regulation of B7-H6. After metalloprotease inhibitor
treatment, B7-H6 surface expression was increased, leading
to enhanced NKp30-dependent NK-cell degranulation. Finally, elevated amounts of soluble B7-H6 were detectable in sera
of a subset of patients with melanoma compared with healthy
individuals. Thus, our study uncovers a novel mechanism of
B7-H6 regulation on tumor cells involving metalloproteases
and might help to design more effective regimens for cancer
treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cells, sera, and melanoma samples
Cell lines AsPC-1, Capan-1 (pancreatic adenocarcinoma),
A375, SK-Mel-37 (melanoma), CaSki, SiHa, HeLa (cervical
carcinoma), HCT-116 (colon carcinoma), A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), MDA-231, MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), and HepG2
(hepatocellular carcinoma) were cultured in complete DMEM
supplemented 10% fetal calf serum, 1% L-glutamine (all from
Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich).
The pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines BxPC-3/VC and
BxPC-3/B7-H6, the melanoma cell lines SK-Mel28/VC and
SK-Mel28/B7-H6, and the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7/
VC and MCF-7/B7-H6 [retrovirally transduced with pMXneo
(Vector Control, VC) or pMXneo-CD8L-Myc tag-B7-H6, respectively, as previously described in ref. 28] were maintained in
RPMI 1640 (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% Lglutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 300 mg/mL G418
(Invitrogen). For the detection of soluble B7-H6 in cell culture
supernatants, cells were grown in OptiMEM I (1) þ GlutaMAX-I (Invitrogen). Before analysis, supernatants were 5
concentrated (BxPC-3/B7-H6) or 10 concentrated (all other
cell lines) using Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filters (Merck
Millipore). NK-92 CI were cultured as described (29). NK-cell
isolation from buffy coats of healthy donors was performed as
speciﬁed (30). NK cells were cultured overnight in CellGro Stem
Cell Growth Medium (CellGenix) with 10% human AB serum
(PAA) and 200 U/mL recombinant human interleukin 2 (IL2;
NIH). Cell lines were routinely tested for contamination by the
Multiplex cell Contamination Testing service at the German
Cancer Research Center. Serum samples from patients with
disease stage IV melanoma were selected from a deep-frozen
serum bank hosted by the Department of Dermatology at the
University Hospital Essen. All samples were obtained and

processed following a standardized protocol as previously
described (27). Serum was harvested and immediately frozen
at 20 C. Thereafter, all samples underwent none or only one
additional freeze–thaw cycle before the ﬁnal thawing for analysis. Selection criteria were histologically conﬁrmed melanoma,
documentation of medical history, and follow-up. Patient sera
and melanoma tumor tissue were obtained after written
informed consent and with approval of the local ethics committee (University Hospital Essen, approval number: 11-4715).
Reagents
For ﬂow cytometry, antibodies (Abs) speciﬁc for the following antigens were used: B7-H6 (1.18, produced as described; ref. 31), CD107a-FITC (H4A3; Biolegend), CD45-APC (HI30;
Biolegend), CD56-APC (HCD56; Biolegend), goat anti-mouse-PE
(Dianova), goat anti-human-PE (Jackson Immuno-Research),
and isotype controls mIgG1-FITC (MOPC-21; Biolegend),
mIgG2a (MOPC-173; Biolegend). CD99-FP (Control-FP) and
NKG2D-FP were obtained from R&D Systems. For ELISA the
following Abs were generated: clone 284 1.3 [generated against
the following peptide of B7-H6: WEKQTQKFPHPIEISC (aa177–
191)]; biotinylated 796 anti-B7-H6 [epitope LKLNSSQEDPGTVYQC (aa213–228), commissioned from Eurogentec]. The 797
anti-B7-H6 [peptide-puriﬁed rabbit anti-B7-H6 (epitope WEKQTQKFPHPIEISC, aa177–191), commissioned from Eurogentec]
was used for immunoblot analysis. In functional assays, NK cell
receptors were blocked with mAbs against NKp30 (P30-15;
Biolegend), NKG2D (BAT221; Miltenyi Biotech), or mIgG1 isotype control (11711; R&D) at a concentration of 5 mg/106 cells.
Batimastat (BB94; Calbiochem), Marimastat (M2699; Sigma
Aldrich), GI254023X, and GW208264X (kindly provided by
Andreas Ludwig, Aachen, Germany and Stefan Rose-John, Kiel,
Germany) were used as indicated. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin were purchased from Sigma.
ELISA
Plates were coated with 5 mg/mL mouse anti-B7-H6 mAb
(clone 284 1.3), washed and blocked by addition of 200 mL 10%
BSA in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. As standard, B7-H6Fc (a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of B7-H6 and an
Fc mutein) diluted 1:3 in normal serum was used. B7-H6-Fc was
produced in HEK 293 T cells from the construct pcDNA3.1(þ)-SPB7-H6-Fc mutein-SBP-tag as previously described (32). The standard and samples (diluted in 10% BSA/PBS/0.05% Tween20) were
added at 100 mL per well and the plates were incubated overnight
at 4 C. For analysis of patient samples, sera were prediluted 1:3
in PBS/0.05% Tween20. After incubation, plates were washed and
B7-H6 protein was detected with the biotinylated rabbit antiB7-H6 796 antibody at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg/mL in PBS/
0.05% Tween20 for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing,
streptavidin-HRP (1:200; R&D) was added for 30 minutes at room
temperature. Subsequently, plates were washed and developed
using 3,30 ,5,50 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) Liquid Substrate System (Sigma). The absorbance was measured at 450 nm.
Degranulation assay
Assays were performed with target cells pretreated with
batimastat or DMSO and washed twice to remove the

compounds. NK-92CI or healthy donor NK cells activated
overnight with IL2 were used as effectors after incubating
of NK-cell receptors with speciﬁc mAbs or respective isotype
controls. Targets and effectors were cocultured as described
(30). NK cells were analyzed for expression of CD107a
by ﬂow cytometry after gating on CD56þ or CD45þ 7-AAD
cells. The % speciﬁc degranulation was calculated as
follows: (% experimental degranulation)  (% spontaneous
degranulation).
Statistical analysis
Analyses of signiﬁcance were performed with Student t test
or Mann–Whitney U test using GraphPad Prism 5.

Results
Soluble B7-H6 is detectable in the supernatants of tumor
cell lines
To obtain a comprehensive understanding about the
expression of B7-H6, cell lines derived from different tumor
entities were analyzed for relative B7-H6 mRNA expression
(Fig. 1A) and B7-H6 cell surface expression (Fig. 1B). In
certain cell lines such as BxPC-3 and HepG2, comparatively
high mRNA levels but intermediate B7-H6 surface expression were observed. This suggests that B7-H6 might be
regulated on the posttranscriptional level in these cell lines.
Thus, we analyzed the possibility of shedding of B7-H6 from
the cell surface of tumor cells of various tumor entities with
different levels of B7-H6 expression. Western blot analyses of
concentrated supernatants harvested after 24 or 48 hours of
culture revealed the presence of B7-H6 with a molecular
weight of approximately 50 to 75 kDa (Fig. 1C). Because B7H6 harbors several predicted N-glycosylation sites (9, 10),
PNGase F treatment to cleave sugar residues was performed.
Indeed, after PNGase F treatment of cell lysates and supernatants from BxPC-3 pancreatic carcinoma cells that overexpress B7-H6 containing an N-terminal myc-tag a distinct
band of approximately 55 kDa in the cell lysate and of 30
kDa in the supernantant was detected (Fig. 1D). The 55 kDa
band corresponds to the size of full-length B7-H6 and the 30
kDa band to the size of the extracellular domain both
including the myc-tag. Similar results were obtained when
blots were developed with an anti-myc mAb (Fig. 1E). To
quantify levels of soluble B7-H6, we established a sandwich
ELISA (Fig. 1F, left). In concordance with the results
obtained in Western blots, soluble B7-H6 was also detected
by ELISA in the supernatants of these cell lines (Fig. 1F,
right).
Tumor cell supernatants modulate NKp30 expression
regardless of the presence or absence of soluble B7-H6
Previous reports demonstrated downregulation of the activating NK-cell receptor NKG2D by cell-bound and soluble
NKG2D ligands such as MICA (22, 24, 33). To investigate
whether soluble B7-H6 would have a similar effect on NKp30
expression, supernatants of B7-H6 overexpressing BxPC-3, SKMel28, and MCF-7 cell lines and their corresponding vector
control cells were tested for their impact on NKp30 expression.

www.aacrjournals.org

As expected, supernatants form BxPC-3, SK-Mel28, and MCF-7
vector control cell lines contained low or no soluble B7-H6, but
BxPC-3, SK-Mel28, and MCF-7 cells overexpressing B7-H6
contained high levels of soluble B7-H6 (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). NK92-CI cells that express high levels of NKp30 were
incubated with supernatants concentrated as indicated and
surface expression of NKp30 was analyzed. Supplementary
Fig. S1C shows that supernatants from tumor cell lines downregulated NKp30 expression regardless of the presence/
absence of soluble B7-H6, indicating that in these supernatants, other factors than B7-H6 were responsible for the
modulation of NKp30 surface levels.
Shedding of B7-H6 is inhibited by the MMP/ADAM
inhibitor batimastat
Because matrix metalloproteases (MMP) and ADAMs play
an important role in proteolytic shedding of cell surface
molecules from tumor cells such as NKG2D ligands (18–20),
we investigated the effect of metalloprotease inhibitors on
the release of B7-H6 from tumor cells. Batimastat is known
to inhibit shedding mediated by MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, and -9 as
well as ADAM-8 and -17, dependent on the applied amounts
(IC50 ¼ 3, 4, 20, 6, 4, 51.3, and 19 nmol/L, respectively) (34).
To determine whether proteolytic shedding was involved in
the generation of soluble B7-H6, we treated BxPC-3/B7-H6
pancreatic carcinoma with the indicated concentrations of
batimastat. Upon batimastat treatment, profoundly reduced
levels of soluble B7-H6 in the supernatants were observed in
Western blot analysis and ELISA (Fig. 2A). In parallel, cell
viability was not affected. To verify that shedding of B7-H6
by metalloproteases was not restricted to BxPC-3/B7-H6
cells, we treated additional cell lines that endogenously
express B7-H6 with batimastat (Fig. 2B). Similar results were
obtained with these cell lines, indicating that B7-H6 is
released from tumor cell lines derived from several tumor
entities by MMPs and/or ADAM proteases.
Batimastat upregulates B7-H6 surface expression on
tumor cells and leads to enhanced NKp30-dependent
degranulation of NK cells
The interaction of NKp30 with B7-H6 expressing targets was
shown to enhance degranulation of NK cells (9). Therefore, we
investigated whether treatment of tumor cells with batimastat
modulates NKp30-dependent NK-cell activation. Treatment of
BxPC-3/B7-H6 with batimastat reduced the amount of soluble
B7-H6 (Fig. 2). In parallel, cell surface levels of B7-H6 were
increased (Fig. 3A). Next, we asked whether batimastat-mediated upregulation of B7-H6 on target cells results in improved
recognition by NK cells. Pretreated target cells were cocultured
with NK-92 CI effector cells that mainly exert effector functions
via NKp30 (35). As shown in Fig. 3B, pretreatment of targets
with batimastat signiﬁcantly increased degranulation of NK-92
CI cells. Importantly, degranulation of NK cells was abrogated
by blocking with an anti-NKp30 mAb (Fig. 3C). In addition, we
assessed the impact of batimastat pretreatment of target cells
on degranulation of IL2–activated primary NK cells from
healthy donors. In concordance with previous studies (36),
batimastat treatment of tumor cells also enhanced cell surface

of target cells resulted in an enhanced effector function of
primary NK cells that was largely inhibited by addition of a
blocking anti-NKp30 mAb and was further decreased by a
blocking anti-NKG2D mAb (Fig. 3E). Together, these data
demonstrate that upregulation of B7-H6 by batimastat on
tumor cells increases NKp30-dependent activation of NK
cells.

ADAM-10/-17 are involved in the shedding of B7-H6
Because batimastat inhibits a broad spectrum of sheddases,
we aimed at identifying speciﬁc sheddases contributing to B7H6 shedding. Thus, we investigated the effects of additional
metalloprotease inhibitors including marimastat, an inhibitor
for MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, and -14 and ADAM-17 and GI254023X
that mainly targets ADAM-10 and GW208264X that inhibits

ionomycin-induced Ca2þ inﬂux (37, 38) or by PMA treatment
(39, 40), respectively, both ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 might be
also implicated in induced B7-H6 shedding. Thus, BxPC-3/B7H6 cells transfected with siRNAs directed against ADAM-10 or
ADAM-17 or control siRNA were treated with PMA or ionomycin for 2 hours. In this experimental set-up, similar induction of soluble B7-H6 by PMA or ionomycin were observed by
Western blot analysis upon ADAM-10 or ADAM-17 knockdown
compared with controls (data not shown). The disulﬁde isomerase ERp5 was described to be involved in the shedding of
MIC-A (17). Supplementary Fig. S2B shows that addition of the
disulﬁde isomerase inhibitors (5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitorbenzoic
acid) (DTNB) for 24 hours signiﬁcantly reduced soluble B7H6 in A375 and BxPC-3/B7-H6 cells. Of note, DTNB was not
toxic for both cell lines at the used concentrations as shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2A. Thus, ERp5 might be involved in B7H6 shedding.
Elevated levels of soluble B7-H6 are detected in sera of a
subset of patients with melanoma
So far, we demonstrated that tumor cell lines express B7-H6
mRNA and release B7-H6 as a soluble form in cell culture
supernatants. To extend these studies to malignant disease, we
analyzed B7-H6 mRNA in samples of patients suffering from
stage III and IV melanoma and healthy controls and determined the amount of soluble B7-H6 in sera. As shown in Fig. 5A,
mRNA levels of B7-H6 were increased in a subset of stage IV
melanoma samples compared with stage III melanomas and
healthy controls included in the tissue array. In sera of healthy
individuals levels of soluble B7-H6 were comparatively low/
absent (Fig. 5B). Most importantly, in a subset of patients with
stage IV melanoma signiﬁcantly elevated amounts of soluble
B7-H6 compared with healthy controls were observed. These
data indicate that in sera of a subset of patients with melanoma
soluble B7-H6 is increased corresponding to the B7-H6 mRNA
expression pattern in melanoma samples. To investigate
whether different levels of soluble B7-H6 correlated with the
protein expression of B7-H6 determined by immunohistochemistry in situ, tumor samples from three patients with
stage IV melanoma were analyzed. Indeed, expression of B7-H6
in tumor tissue was detected in samples from two patients with
melanoma containing high levels of soluble B7-H6 (37.04 and
28.54 ng/mL) in the serum (Fig. 5C; top and left bottom). In a
patient sample with low-soluble B7-H6 (5.67 ng/mL) in the
serum also low B7-H6 expression was detected in tumor tissue
(Fig. 5C; middle bottom). Thus, the amounts of soluble B7-H6
in sera of patients with melanoma correlated with the expression levels of B7-H6 in situ in the three patients analyzed. Of
note, B7-H6 was not detectable in normal epidermis (Fig. 5C;
right bottom).

Discussion
NK cells play a central role in the eradication of transformed
cells (41). However, multiple mechanisms of tumor evasion
from NK-cell–mediated antitumor activity, such as the release
of ligands for the activating NK-cell receptor NKG2D have been
identiﬁed (13, 14). Our study demonstrates that tumor cells

3436

Cancer Res; 74(13) July 1, 2014

release B7-H6, the ligand for the activating NK-cell receptor
NKp30, by ectodomain shedding, leading to decreased surface
levels of B7-H6 on tumor cells and reduced NKp30-mediated
recognition by NK cells.
B7-H6 was initially described as a tumor cell–expressed
ligand of NKp30 (9). B7-H6 is expressed on the cell surface of
many different tumor cell lines (9, 35) and on certain tumor
cells in situ but not on healthy PBMC or primary keratinocytes
(9, 35). In addition, B7-H6 has been detected on monocytes and
neutrophils after application of inﬂammatory stimuli (12).
Because we observed relatively high levels of B7-H6 mRNA in
several tumor cell lines with comparatively little B7-H6 cell
surface expression, we considered the possibility of posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms such as shedding of B7-H6
from the tumor cell surface. Indeed, in supernatants of tumor
cell lines of different origins, we detected B7-H6 with a molecular weight of approximately 50 to 75 kDa. Following PNGase F
treatment to remove sugar residues, a distinct band of 30 kDa
was observed resembling the protein core of the extracellular
domain of B7-H6 including the N-terminal Myc-tag. As
expected, in cell lysates B7-H6 was detected at a molecular
weight corresponding to the full length glycosylated protein.
Treatment with batimastat, a broad-range metalloprotease
inhibitor, reduced the amounts of B7-H6 in supernatants,
indicating that MMP/ADAMs are involved in ectodomain
shedding of B7-H6. In parallel, we observed elevated levels of
B7-H6 cell surface expression upon inhibitor treatment, leading to enhanced NKp30-mediated recognition of tumor targets
by primary NK cells. Accordingly, it was shown that also
shedding of certain NKG2D ligands such as MICA (20), MICB
(36), and ULBP2 (21) is mediated by metalloproteases and can
be inhibited by metalloproteinase inhibitors (19, 20, 36). Higher
levels of cell surface NKG2D ligand expression on target cells,
resulting in enhanced NKG2D-mediated NK cell activation,
were observed after inhibitor treatment. Thus, metalloprotease
inhibitor treatment not only increases surface levels of the
NKp30 ligand B7-H6 but also of NKG2D ligands, resulting in
NK-cell–mediated killing of tumor cells exerted by different
pathways.
Upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of ADAM-10 or ADAM17 in tumor cell lines, decreased soluble B7-H6 and augmented
B7-H6 surface expression was detected, demonstrating an
involvement of both ADAM-10 and ADAM-17. Upon silencing
of ADAM-10 or ADAM-17, B7-H6 shedding was not completely
inhibited. This partial inhibition might be because of incomplete knockdown of these proteases. It is also possible that
additional sheddases contributed to B7-H6 shedding. Matta
and colleagues demonstrated that monocytes and neutrophils
activated via inﬂammatory stimuli shed B7-H6 via exosomes
(12). In our study, tumor cell supernatants contained B7-H6 at
a molecular weight that corresponded to the B7-H6 ectodomain. Because proteolytic cleavage might also occur in exosomes (37), we cannot exclude that the B7-H6 ectodomain
might also be included in exosomes. Of note, the release of
soluble NKG2D-ligands was mediated by proteases (16–18, 20,
21, 36) and/or exosomal secretion (15, 16) depending on the
ligand and the cellular system used. B7-H6 shedding was
strongly induced by PMA or Ionomycin (Fig. 4F). Of note, the

Release of the B7-H6 Ectodomain by Tumor Cells

induced shedding of B7-H6 was not signiﬁcantly altered, when
ADAM-10 or ADAM-17 were knocked down (data not shown).
The knockdown was conﬁrmed in these experiments by Western blot analysis and ﬂow cytometry, but as shown in Fig. 4C it
was incomplete. Thus, we cannot exclude that a more efﬁcient
knockdown of ADAM-10/-17 would have affected the strong
induction of soluble B7-H6 by PMA or Ionomycin. The addition
of a protein disulﬁde isomerase inhibitor, DTNB, reduced
soluble B7-H6 (Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting that ERp5
might be involved in B7-H6 shedding. Because this inhibitor is
relatively unspeciﬁc, further analysis has to be performed to
address the relevance of ERp5 in B7-H6 shedding.
We observed signiﬁcantly elevated levels of soluble B7-H6 in
the sera of patients with melanoma compared with healthy
donors. Further studies with a larger cohort of patients have to
be performed to evaluate soluble B7-H6 as a potential biomarker correlated with tumor progression and patient survival. In fact, our mRNA analyses revealed higher B7-H6 mRNA
expression in stage IV melanoma compared with stage III. Our
ﬁnding that only a subset of patients with stage IV melanoma
expressed B7-H6 is intriguing. We are currently evaluating the

possible factors that might be responsible for the upregulation
of B7-H6 in these melanomas. In gastrointestinal stromal
tumors alternatively spliced NKp30 isoforms affect prognosis.
It would be informative to assess the NKp30 status of patients
with melanoma in the context of B7-H6 expression. Importantly, when we analyzed three melanoma samples matched to
sera containing high/low levels of soluble B7-H6, B7-H6 protein
expression that mostly colocalized with tumor cells correlated
with amounts of soluble B7-H6. Thus, the analysis of soluble
B7-H6 might help to select patients that could be suited for
therapies designed to target B7-H6. Of note, also sera of
individuals that did not report any obvious manifestation of
disease contained moderate levels of soluble B7-H6. In this
context, monocytes and neutrophils activated with inﬂammatory stimuli were shown to release B7-H6 (12). It is possible that
elevated sB7-H6 levels in so-called "healthy" individuals might
be because of certain inﬂammatory conditions including allergies or not documented infections.
In certain studies, soluble NKG2D ligands were shown to
downregulate NKG2D expression. Soluble MICA in sera of
patients with cancer downregulated NKG2D on the cell surface

of T cells and/or NK cells associated with impaired cytolysis of
tumor targets (22, 23, 33). However, in patients with melanoma
high levels of soluble NKG2D ligands in sera did not correlate
with low NKG2D expression on NK cells (27). In our study, we
incubated NK-92 CI cells with concentrated supernatants harvested from three different tumor cell lines transduced with
a B7-H6 containing vector or vector control that contained
soluble B7-H6 or showed no or very low levels of soluble B7-H6,
respectively. Regardless of the presence of soluble B7-H6,
NKp30 expression on NK cells was reduced in these cultures,
indicating that factors other than soluble B7-H6 in these supernatants modulated expression of NKp30. In this context,
TGFb that is often produced by tumor cells was shown to impair expression of NKp30 on human NK cells (42, 43). Neutralization of TGFb did not rescue NKp30 expression when added
to the supernatant of BxPC-3/B7-H6 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1D). Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) released by melanoma cells were shown to inhibit
expression of NKp30 (44). Again, treatment of BxPC-3/B7-H6
cells with IDO or PGE2 inhibitors did not rescue NKp30
expression when supernatant was transferred to NK-92 CI cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1E). Of note, BAG-6, a NKp30 ligand
without classical transmembrane domain, was not detectable
in the supernatant of BxPC-3/B7-H6 cells by speciﬁc ELISA
(data not shown). Thus, the factor responsible for NKp30
downregulation on NK92-CI cells in our experimental system
remains elusive. Recently, a soluble form of B7-H6 in sera of
sepsis patients was described that was associated with the
exosomal fraction (12). In the study by Matta and colleagues
(12), incubation of NK cells with B7-H6 positive pellets that
sedimented with the exosomal fraction led to an impairment
of NKp30 expression and function whereas B7-H6 negative
pellets failed to do so. Thus, it is possible that B7-H6 associated
with exosomes might have a different functional impact on
NK cells compared with soluble B7-H6 generated by ectodomain shedding. Accordingly, BAG-6 was shown to differently
affect NK-cell function in exosomal versus soluble form (45).
In summary, our results demonstrate that B7-H6 is released
from the cell surface of tumor cells by metalloproteases similar to NKG2D ligands such as MICA/B and ULBP2. Dysregulation of proteolytic shedding by ADAMs is associated with
autoimmune diseases (46), infection (47), inﬂammation (48),
and cancer (49, 50). Increased expression of certain ADAMfamily members has been described on tumor cells of different

origin (31). These ADAMs were critically involved in promoting
tumor growth and metastasis (51, 52) and their elevated
expression levels often correlated with a shorter survival rate
of patients (53). Because ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 are ubiquitously expressed in different tumors including melanoma
exhibiting tumor-promoting function (54), these ADAMs are
increasingly regarded as attractive targets for cancer therapies
(55). Treatment with metalloprotease inhibitors led to elevated
surface levels of B7-H6 on tumor cells, resulting in enhanced
NK-cell–mediated killing. Thus, combinatorial therapies incorporating a novel generation of MMP/ADAM inhibitors with
NK-cell–based therapies might represent promising strategies
for cancer therapies.
