BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab is part of the standard treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive breast cancer, but not all patients respond to trastuzumab. Altered microRNA (miR)
expression levels in cancer cells have been correlated with prognosis and response to chemotherapy. The authors of
this report hypothesized that altered miR expression levels in plasma are associated with sensitivity to trastuzumab
in patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer. METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze plasma samples, including samples from patients with breast cancer who were enrolled in a
clinical trial of neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. Expression levels of miR-210, miR-21, miR-29a, and
miR-126 were analyzed according to the type of response (pathologic complete response [n ¼ 18] vs residual disease
[n ¼ 11]). MicroRNA expression levels also were compared in trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant breast
cancer cells derived from BT474 cells and in an independent set of preoperative plasma samples (n ¼ 39) and postoperative plasma samples (n ¼ 30) from 43 breast cancer patients who did not receive any treatment. RESULTS: At
baseline before patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab, circulating miR-210 levels
were significantly higher in those who had residual disease than in those who achieved a pathologic complete
response (P ¼ .0359). The mean expression ratio for miR-210 was significantly higher in trastuzumab-resistant BT474
cells, and miR-210 expression was significantly higher before surgery than after surgery (P ¼ .0297) and in patients
whose cancer metastasized to the lymph nodes (P ¼ .0030). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating miR-210 levels were associated with trastuzumab sensitivity, tumor presence, and lymph node metastases. These results suggest that plasma
miR-210 may be used to predict and perhaps monitor response to therapies that contain trastuzumab. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is amplified in 20% to 30% of invasive breast cancers, and its
amplification is associated with poor patient prognosis.1 Since the advent of treatment with the anti-HER2 monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab, the survival of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer has improved significantly, and

trastuzumab is now part of the standard treatment for
HER2-positive breast cancer. Monotherapy or combination treatment with trastuzumab results in a 30% to 50%
response rate; however, most patients develop resistance to
trastuzumab within 1 year.2-5 Although 1 study revealed
that combining trastuzumab with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant setting resulted in a pathologic complete response
(pCR) rate >65%, almost 35% of patients who received
trastuzumab and chemotherapy still had residual disease.6
Although breast cancer can respond to chemotherapy, its sensitivity to a given drug regimen varies with each
patient. The identification of patients who would benefit
from specific chemotherapeutic agents before treatment
could increase the proportion of cancers that respond to
treatment and potentially may help patients avoid the toxicity of ineffective chemotherapy. Amplification and consequent overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer is
necessary for the cancer to respond to trastuzumab, but it
is apparently not the only factor involved: Approximately
70% of cancers with HER2 amplification fail to respond
to trastuzumab.7 One interesting study reported that
HER2 blockade (trastuzumab) improved tumor oxygenation in Her2/neu-positive tumors,7 and that study suggested that response to trastuzumab treatment correlates
with tumor hypoxia. Several studies revealed that tumor
hypoxia has been associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.8,9 In particular, the robust induction of microRNA 210 (miR210) in hypoxic MCF-7 cell lines in 1 study proved to be
a marker for hypoxia levels in tumors.10
It is known that microRNAs (miRNAs), which are
endogenous RNAs approximately 20 to 23 nucleotides in
length, play important regulatory roles in animals and
plants by targeting messenger RNA transcripts for cleavage or translational repression.11 The emergence of miRNAs as regulators of gene expression suggests that they
may be able to serve as novel diagnostic and prognostic
biomarkers for disease and as predictive biomarkers for
treatment. Although studies of miRNA expression in
breast cancer have suggested that some miRNAs are
promising candidates for these roles, most of those studies
used samples from tumor tissues,10,12-14 which frequently
are not available in the amounts necessary for detailed molecular investigation. Blood can be sampled much less
invasively than tissue, and studies have reported that levels
of miRNAs in blood from patients with cancer are detectable and remarkably stable.15 Many studies have sought
to identify miRNA markers in plasma or serum from
patients with cancer16-18; however, to our knowledge,

2604

none have examined miRNA levels in breast cancer as
they relate to drug resistance.
We hypothesized that expression levels of miRNAs
in plasma would be related to trastuzumab resistance in
patients with HER-2-positive invasive breast cancer. To
test this hypothesis, we measured expression levels of miRNAs in plasma from patients with HER2-positive breast
cancer before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy that
included trastuzumab, and we analyzed the relation
between mean relative miRNA expression levels and
response to treatment. In a separate analysis, we also
examined the relation between mean relative miRNA
expression levels and the presence of breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Treatment Response Analysis
After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval from
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MD Anderson) and written informed consent from participants, we collected whole blood samples from 29
consecutive patients with breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab at MD Anderson and from 28 healthy, age-matched volunteers women
who were recruited from MD Anderson and served as
controls. We collected the blood samples at baseline
(before chemotherapy) and 24 weeks after the start of
chemotherapy from patients in the treatment group, and
we collected blood samples at the time of study enrollment from healthy women in the control group. All 29
patients with breast cancer in this study had histologically
confirmed breast cancer and were positive for HER2 in
either fluorescence in situ hybridization or immunohistochemical analysis. Relevant demographic and clinicopathologic patient data were obtained from a prospectively
maintained breast cancer database (Table 1). The pCR
rate for this group (defined as no evidence of residual cancer in either breast or in the axilla) was 65%, as reported
previously.6 The median age of the 28 healthy volunteers
was 53.5 years (range, 22-71 years), which was not significantly different from that of the treatment group (median
age, 52.0 years; range, 21-70 years).
Each patient in the treatment group received 4 cycles
of paclitaxel followed by 4 cycles of combined fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC). Paclitaxel
was administered at a dose of 225 mg/m2 as a 24-hour,
continuous intravenous infusion, and cycles were repeated
every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. FEC consisted of 500 mg/m2
of intravenous fluorouracil on days 1 and 4, 500 mg/m2

neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gyeongsang National University Hospital, and informed consent
was obtained from all patients. All patients had histologically confirmed breast cancer. Plasma samples were collected preoperatively and in the second week
postoperatively. Among the 43 patients, 13 tested positive
for HER2 in immunohistochemical analysis (minimum
score, 3þ); fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses
were not performed in patients whose tumors were negative for HER2 on immunostaining (Table 2).
Plasma Collection
Up to 8 mL of whole blood were collected from each participant in an ethylene diamine tetracetic acid tube. Blood
samples were centrifuged at 1200 g for 10 minutes at
4 C to separate the blood cells, and the supernatant was
transferred into microcentrifuge tubes and then centrifuged a second time at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C
to completely remove the cellular components. Plasma
was aliquoted and stored at 80 C until use. Blood samples were processed and plasma was frozen within 4 hours
of collection.

Establishment of a Trastuzumab-Resistant
BT474 Breast Cancer Cell Clone
Wild-type BT474 cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va). These cells were
seeded into 6-well cell-culture dishes and were treated
continuously with trastuzumab (Genentech, South San
Francisco, Calif) at a concentration of 10 lg/mL for 6
months. Cultures were replenished with fresh medium
containing trastuzumab every week. After 6 months, the
cells were tested for sensitivity to trastuzumab based on
their levels of up-regulation of p27Kip1 protein and cellcycle arrest. Individual colonies that were resistant to trastuzumab (ie, those without p27Kip1 induction and cellcycle arrest at the G1 phase) were chosen microscopically,
expanded, and rechecked for resistance to trastuzumab.
Clone 65 (which we called BTR65) was the clone that
exhibited the maximal resistance compared with wildtype BT474 cells. Both wild-type BT474 and BTR65 cells
seeded onto 100-mm cell-culture dishes were treated once
with trastuzumab 10 lg/mL for 48 hours. More details
were published previously.19
RNA Extraction
Total RNA was isolated from plasma samples using the
Norgen RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek Corporation, Thorold, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, lysis solution was added to
100 lL of plasma, and then ethanol was added. The
lysates were then loaded onto the provided column, and
most of the contaminating cellular proteins were removed
as they flowed through it. The column was then washed 3
times with 400 lL of wash solution. The purified total
RNA was eluted into as much as 50 lL or as little as 20 lL
of elution buffer. Eluted RNA samples were quantified
using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, Del). The mean
amount of total eluted RNA in each sample was 182.39
ng (range, 111-378 ng).
Total RNA was extracted from BT474 cells and trastuzumab-resistant BTR65 cells using the TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). The concentrations of all
RNA samples were quantified using the NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer.
Quantitative Reverse
Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
for Evaluation of MicroRNA Expression
We selected a group of 4 miRNAs (miR-210, miR-21,
miR-29a, and miR-126) that were expressed abnormally

2606

in the initial study and in other studies that reported
altered expression profiles of some miRNAs in breast cancer.12,20-22 The miRNAs we chose also reportedly are
influenced by hypoxia in breast cancer cells, and high
expression levels of miR-21 have been correlated with
trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer.23,24
Expression levels of miR-210, miR-21, miR-29a,
and miR-126 were detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the
TaqMan MicroRNA Assay kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty nanograms of total RNA from each sample
were reverse transcribed using the TaqMan MicroRNA
Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). PCR
amplifications were carried out in final volumes of 10 lL
using the CFX384 real-time PCR detection system (BioRad, Hercules, Calif). Amplifications were initiated with
10-minute incubation at 95 C followed by 40 cycles at
95 C for 15 seconds and 60 C for 60 seconds. Each
amplification reaction was performed in duplicate wells
and was measured independently on 2 different days. To
normalize the expression levels of miRNAs, we used U6
RNA as an internal control. The relative expression of
each miRNA was calculated from the following equation:
relative expression ¼ 2 DCt, where Ct is the threshold
cycle for a sample, and DCt ¼ mean CtmiRNA  mean
Ctcontrol U6. The mean relative expression levels for each
miRNA were compared using 2-sided Student t tests
(P < .05).
Statistical Analysis
All values are expressed as means  standard deviations.
Independent sample t tests were used to compare
miRNA levels between patients with breast cancer at
baseline and healthy controls, between patients who
achieved a pCR and those with residual disease according
to trastuzumab treatment response, and between the
wild-type BT474 cell line and clone 65. Paired Korean
samples were analyzed with t tests for paired data analysis. We dichotomized miR-210 levels (low and high)
according to the median level for an analysis of the correlation between miR-210 expression and tumor size or
lymph node status. Corresponding distribution plots
were generated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, Calif). Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software package (version 16.0;
SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). All tests were 2 sided, and differences in miRNAs expression were considered statistically significant at P < .05.

RESULTS
Expression of MicroRNAs in Plasma From
Patients With Breast Cancer
First, we determined whether miR-210, miR-21, miR29a, and miR-126 were expressed in plasma from patients
with breast cancer in the treatment group (n ¼ 29) and
from healthy women in the control group (n ¼ 28) in the
MD Anderson cohort. In 2 baseline plasma samples, none
of the tested miRNAs were expressed; therefore, we analyzed miRNA expressions in 27 samples at baseline and in
29 samples at 24 weeks after the start of chemotherapy.
The mean Ct values for miR-210, miR-21, miR-29a, and
miR-126 in the treatment group were 34.97 (range,
31.94-38.01), 26.26 (range, 23.77-28.95), 31.36 (range,
27.59-34.38), and 27.45 (range, 25.09-30.23), respectively. In the control group, the mean Ct values were
35.96, 27.89, 32.89, and 28.26 for miR-210, miR-21,
miR-29a, and miR-126, respectively. These values indicate that the miRNAs were expressed in both groups. The
mean Ct values for U6 (internal control) in the treatment
and control groups ranged from 32.75 to 34.67, and differences in U6 Ct values between the treatment and control groups were not statistically significant (Fig. 1).
Next, we determined whether mean relative miRNA
expression levels differed between the treatment group
and the control group. The mean relative expression levels
for miR-210, miR-21, miR-29a, and miR-126 were significantly higher in baseline plasma samples (n ¼ 27) in
the treatment group than in the control group (P ¼
.0119, P ¼ .0430, P < .0001, and P < .0001, respectively) (Fig. 1), and the ratios of mean relative miRNA
expression levels in the treatment group to mean relative
miRNA expression levels in the control group (tumor:control expression ratios) were 2.42, 3.09, 4.28, and 2.82,
respectively (Table 3). Thus, we detected measurably
higher expression levels for the 4 miRNAs in the plasma
samples from patients with breast cancer than in the
plasma samples from healthy women of the same age.
Expression Levels of MicroRNAs in Plasma
From Patients With Breast Cancer Before
and After Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab-Based
Chemotherapy
To assess the relation between miRNA expression levels
and response to trastuzumab treatment, we measured
expression levels of the 4 miRNAs before and 24 weeks after the initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy that
included trastuzumab. Among the treated patients, 18
achieved a pCR, and 11 still had residual disease after

Cancer

May 15, 2012

chemotherapy (Table 1). Baseline miRNA expression levels were not available in 2 samples for technical reasons;
therefore, we analyzed 16 baseline samples from patients
who achieved a pCR. Among 29 patients, 10 patients had
residual disease in the breast, 3 patients had residual disease
in lymph nodes, and 2 patients had residual disease in both
sites. For miR-29a, the baseline mean relative expression
level was not related to patients’ ability to achieve a pCR.
For miR-210, miR-21, and miR-126, the mean relative
baseline expression levels were higher in samples from the
residual disease group than in samples from the pCR
group, but only the difference in mean relative expression
levels for miR-210 reached statistical significance (P ¼
.0359) (Fig. 2). Therefore, high baseline mean relative
miR-210 expression levels were associated with resistance
to treatment with trastuzumab in this set of patients.
Expression of MicroRNAs in
Trastuzumab-Sensitive and
Trastuzumab-Resistant Cell Lines
To determine whether variations in miR-210 expression
were related directly to trastuzumab resistance, we measured mean relative miR-210 expression levels in BTR65
cells (clone 65 derived from the HER2-overexpressing
BT474 breast cancer cell line), which exhibited resistance
to trastuzumab.19 Figure 3A indicates that the wild-type
BT474 cells were sensitive to trastuzumab, as evidenced
by up-regulation of the p27Kip1 protein. In contrast, trastuzumab did not induce p27Kip1 protein expression in the
BTR65 clone cells (Fig. 3A).
Next, we measured the ratio of mean relative expression levels after 48 hours of treatment with trastuzumab
to mean relative expression levels with no treatment (trastuzumab:control expression ratio) for each of the 4 miRNAs in wild-type BT474 cells and BTR65 cells (Fig. 3B)
For miR-21 and miR-29a, trastuzumab:control expression ratios were slightly higher in BTR65 cells than in
wild-type BT474 cells, although the difference was not
significant. For miR-126, the expression ratios did not
differ between BT474 cells and BTR65 cells. For miR210, the mean trastuzumab:control expression ratio was
significantly higher in BTR65 cells than in BT474 cells
(0.93 and 0.71, respectively; P ¼ .0075), suggesting that
high levels of miR-210, but not miR-21, miR-29a, or
miR-126, indicate trastuzumab resistance.
Circulating MicroRNA 210 Levels and

Figure 4. Plasma expression levels of microRNA 210 (miR-210), miR-21, miR-29a, and miR-126 are illustrated in patients with
breast cancer patients surgery (Pre-op) (n ¼ 39) and after surgery (Postop) (n ¼ 30). None of the patients received any type of
treatment for breast cancer. Only miR-210 expression was directly linked to the presence of tumor (P ¼ .0297). U6 was used as
an internal control. An asterisk indicates P < .05.

was no relation between mean relative expression levels of
miR-210 and tumor size (Fig. 5). A similar analysis of the
MD Anderson cohort did not reveal any relation between
mean relative expression levels of miRNAs and tumor
size, but the same positive trend was identified, although
it was not statistically significant, for the association with
lymph node status.

DISCUSSION
The current results suggest that high relative expression
levels of miR-210 in plasma from patients with breast cancer are associated with trastuzumab resistance and the
presence of tumor; furthermore, miR-210 expression levels were associated significantly with lymph node involvement in the preoperative group of Korean patients. We
also produced evidence of this in a nonclinical setting, in

which mean relative miR-210 expression levels were
higher in cells from a trastuzumab-resistant cell line than
in trastuzumab-sensitive cells. To our knowledge, this is
the first time a link has been identified between trastuzumab sensitivity and relative expression levels of miR-210
in patient plasma.
The identification of patients who may benefit from
chemotherapeutic agents is of great importance, because
the individualized selection of treatment may maximize
treatment benefit and minimize patient exposure to the
adverse effects of ineffective therapy. Therefore, largescale studies of the relation between relative miRNA
expression levels and chemotherapy response are needed.
In addition, as mentioned above, most studies of chemotherapy response-specific miRNAs have measured
miRNA levels in tumor tissues or cell lines rather than in
plasma.10,12-14 However, frequently, tumor tissues are not

Figure 5. Correlations between microRNA 210 (miR-210) expression levels are illustrated for (A) tumor size and (B) lymph node
involvement. Samples from patients in the preoperative Korean cohort who had positive lymph nodes had significantly higher
levels of miR-210 (P ¼ .0030), but variations in tumor size were not significant. The expression of miR-210 at baseline in samples
from the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) cohort also differed according to lymph node status, but the difference was not

available in the amounts necessary for detailed molecular
investigation, and blood can be sampled much less invasively than tissue. Thus, investigations focusing on relative
miRNA expression levels in plasma are particularly
warranted.
Several studies have focused on the identification of
miRNAs linked to the acquisition of a resistant phenotype
in cancer cell lines. An investigation in cancer cell lines by
Blower et al established the influence of 3 cancer-related
miRNAs (let-7i, miR-16, and miR-21) on anticancer
drug sensitivity. When testing 14 different anticancer
compounds, those authors observed that increased levels
of miR-21 reduced the efficacy of nearly half the tested
anticancer compounds.25 Meng et al demonstrated that
miR-21, miR-141, and miR-200b were highly overex-

2612

pressed in malignant cholangiocytes and that inhibition
of miR-21 and miR-200b increased the sensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma cells to gemcitabine.26
A recent article reported that high expression levels
of miR-21 were associated with trastuzumab resistance in
breast cancer.23 In our current study, instead, we observed
that plasma mean relative expression levels of miR-210
only, and not miR-21, were related to trastuzumab sensitivity. However, we were able to confirm our findings by
comparing the mean relative expression levels of each
miRNA in a trastuzumab-resistant cell line with the
expression levels in a trastuzumab-sensitive cell line.
Our finding of an association of miR-210 with tumor presence and drug resistance is not surprising given
the results from previous studies on miR-210 expression.

Recent clinical studies have reported higher expression
levels of miR-210 in patients with breast cancer, head and
neck cancer, and pancreatic cancer than in healthy controls and that high expression levels were associated with a
poor prognosis.10,27-29 A study of miRNAs as prognostic
markers in pancreatic cancer revealed that the overexpression of miR-210 and of 3 other miRNAs (miR-155, miR201, and miR-222) was associated with shorter survival.27
In fact, many reports on different types of cancer tissues
and blood have revealed that the overexpression of miR210 is associated with a poor prognosis.10,28-30 In a study
of plasma from cancer patients, Ho and colleagues
reported that circulating miR-210 levels may serve as a
diagnostic marker in pancreatic cancer.28
However, miR-210 is not always overexpressed in
cancer. Mean expression levels of miR-210 are lower in
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues and cell lines
than in healthy tissues, and this down-regulation is associated with poor differentiation.31 These results suggest that
expression patterns of miR-210 are specific to tumor type.
In our current study, we observed that mean expression
levels of all miRNAs tested—miR-210, miR-21, miR29a, and miR-126—were significantly higher in plasma
from patients with breast cancer than in plasma from
healthy women. However, when we compared plasma
mean expression levels of these miRNAs in preoperative
breast cancer patients with those in postoperative breast
cancer patients, miR-210 expression alone was significantly lower after tumor resection, suggesting that expression levels of miR-210 may be related directly to the
presence of breast tumor.
We also discovered that, in addition to predicting
the presence of tumor, high expression levels of miR-210
were associated with positive lymph nodes in preoperative
Korean patients and had the same trend (although it was
not statistically significant) in the MD Anderson cohort at
baseline. This can be explained by the smaller size of the
MD Anderson cohort; and, although these results were
obtained from a limited number of patients with different
tumor characteristics, the results were consistent and substantial. However, studies with large-scale cohorts are
needed to determine how well miR-210 may perform as a
predictive marker. In our small cohort, the finding that
mean expression levels of miR-210 were associated with
tumor presence but not with tumor size also suggests that
the expression levels potentially may indicate the early
presence of a tumor, but this finding also needs further
study.

The function of miR-210, which is directly regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, also may
depend on cancer type. MiR-210 inhibits apoptosis,
bypasses cell-cycle arrest, and promotes cancer cell survival when it is overexpressed; however, but when it is
under expressed, as it is in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, it represses the initiation of tumor growth by
inducing cell death and cell-cycle arrest.31-33 To date,
known targets of miR-210 in cancer include the receptor
tyrosine kinase ligand ephrin-A3, EF2 transcription factor
3 (E2F3), the DNA repair enzyme RAD52, and fibroblast
growth factor receptor-like 1.34 MiR-210 also may interact with genes involved in the trastuzumab-resistance
pathway. We searched miR-210 targets using RNA structure prediction software, including RNA22, miRanda,
TargetScan, and PITA, and identified greater than 5300
targets; among these targets, we identified well known
molecular targets for trastuzumab resistance, including
MET, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and membrane-associated mucin 4.35-37 Functional studies beyond
the scope of this article should be performed to clarify the
biologic role of miR-210 in the trastuzumab-resistance
pathway and to determine whether this miRNA also may
act after potential release from cancer cells.38
In summary, our results indicate that high mean
expression levels of miR-210 in plasma are associated
with the presence of tumor in patients with breast cancer
and with trastuzumab resistance in patients with HER2positive breast cancer. Although these results were
obtained from small cohorts, they provide an important
basis for larger, prospective, multi-institutional studies to
investigate the potential role of plasma miRNAs as prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic markers of invasive
breast cancer.
