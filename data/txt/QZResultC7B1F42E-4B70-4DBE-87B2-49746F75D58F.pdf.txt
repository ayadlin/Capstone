Abstract
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth
most frequent cancer worldwide, comprising f50% of all
malignancies in some developing nations. Our recent work
identified protein kinase CE (PKCE) as a critical and causative
player in establishing an aggressive phenotype in HNSCC. In
this study, we investigated the specificity and efficacy of
HN1-PKCE, a novel bifunctional cancer cell homing, PKCE
inhibitory peptide, as a treatment for HNSCC. HN1-PKCE
peptide was designed by merging two separate technologies
and synthesized as a capped peptide with two functional
modules, HN1 (cancer cell homing) and PKCE (specific PKCE
inhibitory), connected by a novel linker module. HN1-PKCE
preferentially internalized into UMSCC1 and UMSCC36 cells,
two HNSCC cell lines, in comparison with oral epithelial cells:
82.1% positive for UMSCC1 and 86.5% positive for UMSCC36
compared with 1.2% positive for oral epithelial cells. In
addition, HN1-PKCE penetrated HNSCC cells in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. Consistent with these in vitro
observations, systemic injection of HN1-PKCE resulted in
selective delivery of HN1-PKCE into UMSCC1 xenografts in
nude mice. HN1-PKCE blocked the translocation of active
PKCE in UMSCC1 cells, confirming HN1-PKCE as a PKCE
inhibitor. HN1-PKCE inhibited cell invasion by 72 F 2% (P <
0.001, n = 12) and cell motility by 56 F 2% (P < 0.001, n = 5) in
UMSCC1 cells. Moreover, in vivo bioluminescence imaging
showed that HN1-PKCE significantly (83 F 1% inhibition; P <
0.02) retards the growth of UMSCC1 xenografts in nude mice.
Our work indicates that the bifunctional HN1-PKCE inhibitory
peptide represents a promising novel therapeutic strategy for
HNSCC. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5829–34]

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth
most frequent cancer worldwide. Nearly 46,000 people will be
diagnosed with HNSCC in the United States this year and an
estimated 11,000 people will die of the disease (1). Although
improvements in local control and survival have been achieved
with the use of multimodality regimens, the overall 5-year survival
rate for HNSCC has not improved significantly over the past
20 years (2, 3). Local-regional relapse and distant metastasis after

definitive therapy remain the major causes of morbidity and
mortality in HNSCC patients. This clinical problem has prompted
substantial efforts in identifying genetic determinants that
contribute to aggressive HNSCC.
Evidence has shown that protein kinase Cq (PKCq), a member of
a family of serine/threonine protein kinases, is a transforming
oncogene and is involved in the development and progression of
skin, breast, and prostate cancer (4–6). Our recent results show
that PKCq plays a critical and causative role in establishing an
aggressive phenotype in HNSCC. We reported that PKCq is
upstream of and directly modulates the Rho GTPase signaling
cascade, specifically RhoA and RhoC, to control cell invasion and
motility (7). Moreover, specific inhibition of PKCq with RNA
interference in HNSCC cells with high endogenous PKCq levels was
sufficient to significantly inhibit cell invasion and motility (7). A
prospective study showed that elevated PKCq in the primary tumor
of HNSCC patients is associated with an increase in disease
recurrence and a decrease in overall survival (8). This observation
agrees with our work that PKCq promotes an aggressive phenotype
in HNSCC and suggests that targeting PKCq may be an effective
anticancer strategy for managing HNSCC patients.
In this study, we determined the effects of a novel cancer cell
homing, PKCq inhibitory peptide on HNSCC cells in vitro and
in vivo. The bifunctional HN1-PKCq peptide was constructed by
connecting two functional motifs, HN1 (cancer cell homing) and
PKCq (specific PKCq inhibitory), with a linker peptide. HN1-PKCq
preferentially penetrated HNSCC cells in vitro and in vivo and
blocked the translocation of active PKCq in HNSCC cells. In
addition, HN1-PKCq inhibited cell invasion, motility, and proliferation in vitro and significantly retarded the growth of HNSCC
xenografts in nude mice. Our work shows that HN1-PKCq is a novel
therapeutic agent with potent antitumor efficacy against HNSCC.

reaction vessel was covered in foil and left to react for 16 h. The resin was
washed thrice with DMF, thrice with CH2Cl2, and thrice with methanol. The
Cy5-labeled PKCq peptide was cleaved from the resin for 2 h in a mixture of
95/2.5/2.5 trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/triisopropylsilane/water. The crude
peptide was precipitated into cold ether and purified by reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography on a Waters C18 column using
water with 0.1% TFA as the A solvent and CH3CN as the B solvent (14%-31%
B over 17 min). Product molecular weight was confirmed by electrospraymass spectrometry in both negative ion mode (m-H+, 1,479.1) and positive
ion mode (M+2H+/2, 740.9).
PKCE translocation. UMSCC1 cells were untreated or treated with
HN1-control or HN1-PKCq for 48 h. Subsequently, cells were stimulated
with a general PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA;
10 nmol/L for 30 min), washed with cold PBS, scraped in homogenization buffer (9), passed through a 25-gauge syringe needle, and spun at
100,000  g for 30 min at 4jC. The cytoplasmic fractions were collected
and the pellets (particulate fractions) were resuspended in homogenization buffer with 1% Triton X-100. Western blot analysis using a PKCqspecific antibody (Millipore) was performed to assess the translocation
of PKCq.
Cell invasion and cell motility. Cell invasion was determined as
described from the cell invasion assay kit (Chemicon International). Cells
were harvested and resuspended in serum-free medium. An aliquot (1  105
cells) of the prepared cell suspension was added into the chamber and
incubated for 24 h at 37jC in a 10% CO2 tissue culture incubator.
Noninvading cells were gently removed from the interior of the inserts with
a cotton-tipped swab. Invasive cells were stained and counted. Random cell
motility was determined as described from the motility assay kit
(Cellomics). Cells were harvested, suspended in medium, and plated on
top of a field of microscopic fluorescent beads. After a 16-h incubation
period, cells were fixed and areas of clearing in the fluorescent bead field
corresponding to phagokinetic cell tracks were quantified using NIH
ScionImager.

Cell proliferation. Cells were untreated or treated with cis-platinum
(1, 3, or 10 Amol/L), cis-platinum and HN1-control, or cis-platinum and
HN1-PKCq for 3 d. Cell proliferation was assessed using the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent to
detect metabolic active cells (Sigma).
Preclinical efficacy of HN1-PKCE. UMSCC1-luciferase cells (1  106)
were implanted into the flank of 10-wk-old athymic nude mice and tumors
were allowed to develop without treatment. At 2 wk after implantation,
mice with established tumors of f40 mm3 in volume were imaged for
bioluminescence intensity using the Xenogen IVIS Spectrum System
(Caliper Life Sciences). Mice were randomly assigned to three treatment
arms, untreated (n = 9), HN1-control (10 mg/kg, thrice weekly, n = 8), or
HN1-PKCq (10 mg/kg, thrice weekly, n = 11), based on bioluminescence
intensity to achieve a statistically similar mean bioluminescence intensity at
the start of the treatment protocol. Tumor response was assessed on a
weekly basis using the in vivo bioluminescence imaging modality.
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed by Student’s t test. P values
of <0.05 were considered significant.

Results and Discussion
The excitement over PKCs as therapeutic anticancer targets
prompted the rapid development of drugs designed to specifically
inhibit PKCs. The drugs developed to date can be divided into two
main groups: inhibitors that target the C1 regulatory domain and
inhibitors that target the kinase domain. Overall, in numerous
clinical trials, PKC inhibitors have shown very modest activity, at
best, as single agent or in combination with standard chemotherapeutics (10, 11). Bryostatin-1, a PKC modulator that targets
the C1 domain, is the most extensively used in clinical trials. Recent
phase II clinical trials with bryostatin-1 in combination with
cisplatin for cervical squamous cell carcinoma or in combination

Figure 2. HN1-PKCq selectively homes to HNSCC xenografts in vivo. Nude mice
with established UMSCC1 tumors in the flank were untreated or treated

with interleukin-2 for renal cell carcinoma showed minimal
efficacy and perhaps even a possibility of therapeutic antagonism
(12, 13). One possible explanation is that C1 domain inhibitors are
not isoform specific because the C1 domain is well conserved in
the PKC family, with the exception of the atypical isoforms.

Therefore, C1 domain inhibitors likely inhibit desired oncogene-like
PKC isoforms but also have the undesired side effect of inhibiting
tumor suppressor–like PKC isoforms, resulting in no net response
or possibly a tumor stimulatory response. The kinase domain
inhibitors are not specific PKC inhibitors because the kinase
inhibitors target other serine/threonine kinases with higher
specificity. Taken together, there remains a critical need to develop
isoform-specific PKC inhibitors.
The activation of the PKCq signaling cascade is a critical genetic
event resulting in an aggressive HNSCC phenotype. Our laboratory
reported that RhoA and RhoC are directly phosphorylated by PKCq,
resulting in an increase in RhoA/RhoC activation (7). In addition to
regulation of RhoA and RhoC, other groups have published that
PKCq directly phosphorylates Akt and Stat3. PKCq phosphorylates
Akt at Ser473 leading to a full Akt activation state (14). A recent
report showed that PKCq phosphorylates Stat3 at Ser727, resulting
in an increase in nuclear translocation and transcriptional
activation of Stat3 (15). Elevated Akt phosphorylation (Ser473)
significantly correlates with a worse outcome in HNSCC (16, 17).
Nuclear Stat3 accumulation is associated with a decrease in
relapse-free and overall survival in HNSCC (18). Thus, targeting
PKCq is an attractive therapeutic strategy, as inhibition of PKCq will
result in dampening of multiple signal transduction pathways that
are dysregulated in HNSCC.
Protein-protein interactions are critical events in numerous
signaling pathways. However, because protein to protein interfaces
are usually extensive, shallow, and hydrophobic, the disruption of
protein-protein interactions has proven to be difficult targets for
small-molecule drugs. So, we decided to take a different approach
and rationally designed a bifunctional targeting peptide. We
merged two existing and published technologies and constructed
a peptide with two functional modules, HN1 and PKCq, connected
by a linker module. The HN1 module is a 12-mer peptide,

TSPLNIHNGQKL, reported to preferentially bind and internalize
into HNSCC cell lines in vitro (19). Moreover, HN1 was shown to be
stable in vivo and able to localize into HNSCC xenograft tumors
(19). The PKCq inhibitory module (qV1-2) is an 8-mer peptide,
EAVSLKPT, taken from amino acids 14 to 21 located in the pseudoC2 domain of PKCq (20). There is literature to show that the
pseudo-C2 domain of PKCq is required for binding to receptors of
activated PKC (RACK; refs. 21, 22). The PKCq-RACK interaction
allows for the proper trafficking and localization of active PKCq (21,
22). The RACK binding site on PKCq was reported to be a discrete
region located at amino acids 14 to 21 (20). A peptide (qV1-2)
corresponding to this sequence inhibited the translocation and
function of active PKCq through blocking the PKCq-RACK
interaction in cardiac myocytes (20). Moreover, qV1-2 was shown
to be a specific PKCq inhibitor and not able to block the
translocation and function of other PKCs, specifically PKCa,
PKCh and PKCy (20). Subsequent work has clearly shown that
qV1-2 is a specific PKCq inhibitor in other cell types, including
neuronal cells and pancreatic h-cells (23, 24). The control module
is a nonfunctional scrambled PKCq peptide, LSETKPAV (20). The
linker module consists of a 6-mer sequence of 6-aminohexanoic
acid to allow for proper spatial spacing to prevent steric
interference between the HN1- and PKCq-targeting modules.
To determine the efficiency and selectivity of HN1-PKCq for
HNSCC cells in vitro, oral epithelial cells (NOE), UMSCC1, and
UMSCC36 were untreated or treated with a series of different
FITC-labeled peptides (3 Amol/L for 48 hours) followed by

fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Fig. 1A). NOE
cells treated with FITC-labeled HN1-PKCq had minimal effect and
resulted in 1.2% FITC-positive cells with a mean fluorescence
intensity of 1.9. In contrast, FITC-labeled HN1-PKCq treatment of
UMSCC1 and UMSCC36 cells resulted in 82.1% and 86.5% FITCpositive cells, respectively. The mean fluorescence intensity was
15.9 for UMSCC1 cells and 18.3 for UMSCC36 cells with FITClabeled HN1-PKCq treatment. As expected, treatment with FITClabeled scramble-PKCq, a peptide with an inactive cancer cell
homing module, was not as efficient and resulted in 10.2% FITCpositive cells for UMSCC1 and 5.3% FITC-positive cells for
UMSCC36. It is clear that FITC-labeled HN1-PKCq is >8-fold more
efficient (P < 0.03) than FITC-labeled scramble-PKCq, providing
evidence that the addition of the functional HN1 cancer cell
homing module is a critical value-added feature to enhance the
uptake of the PKCq inhibitory module in HNSCC cells. Treatment
with FITC-labeled HN1-control had a similar effect as FITC-labeled
HN1-PKCq and resulted in 82.6% FITC-positive cells for UMSCC1
and 82.7% FITC-positive cells for UMSCC36. This is an important
observation and shows that modification of the amino acid
sequence order of the PKCq inhibitory module to a nonfunctional
scrambled control version does not alter the internalization
efficiency into HNSCC cells. Interestingly, FITC-labeled PKCq is
more efficient than FITC-labeled scramble-PKCq. A likely explanation is that the uptake of FITC-labeled peptides into HNSCC cells is
mass/size dependent because FITC-labeled scramble-PKCq consists of 26 amino acid residues and FITC-labeled PKCq consists of

only 8 amino acid residues. Nonetheless, the internalization
efficiency of FITC-labeled HN1-PKCq is superior to FITC-labeled
PKCq (P < 0.04). Lastly, as shown in Fig. 1C and D, a dose- and
time-dependent uptake of FITC-labeled HN1-PKCq was observed in
UMSCC1 and UMSCC36 cells.
Next, we examined if HN1-PKCq specifically localizes to HNSCC
tumors in vivo. We decided to use Cy5 as the fluorophore for this
experiment because Cy5 exhibits longer excitation and emission
wavelengths than FITC and, thus, enables deeper tissue penetration. Athymic nude mice with established UMSCC1 tumors in
the flank were untreated or treated with Cy5-labeled PKCq or
HN1-PKCq (10 mg/kg by i.p. injection). After 24 hours, mice were
euthanized and tumors and various organs were resected for
fluorescence intensity analysis using the Xenogen IVIS Spectrum
Imaging System (Fig. 2). Ex vivo analysis showed that the tumors
and various organs resected from untreated or Cy5-labeled
PKCq-treated mice exhibit minimal fluorescence. In contrast,
Cy5-labeled HN1-PKCq was selectively delivered to the HNSCC
tumor. Fluorescence intensity was >8-fold higher (P < 0.0001) in
the tumor compared with the various organs in Cy5-labeled
HN1-PKCq–treated mice. These results showed that HN1-PKCq
selectively homed to and penetrated into HNSCC tumors in vivo.
Our work corroborated the findings from Hong and Clayman
(19) and showed that the HN1 motif selectively homes and
penetrates HNSCC cells in comparison with immortalized oral
epithelial cells. Furthermore, we have evidence that HN1-PKCq
does not internalize into primary keratinocytes (data not shown).
Hong and Clayman (19) reported that HN1 did not internalize into
DU145 human prostate cancer cells, SW480 human colon cells, and
U373 MG human astrocytoma cells, suggesting that HN1 may be
specific to squamous cell carcinoma. However, this is not the case
as HN1-PKCq efficiently internalized into MDA-MB231 (70.1% FITC
positive; mean fluorescence intensity of 64.2) and SKBR3 (49.4%
FITC positive; mean fluorescence intensity of 27.3) human breast
cancer cells. Interestingly, HN1-PKCq penetrated MCF10A nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells with much lower efficiency
(8.8% FITC positive; mean fluorescence intensity of 5.9). These
results provide initial evidence that HN1 may be cancer cell specific
but not organ specific. Our observations do not detract from the
significance and utility of HN1 but rather expands the potential
clinical use of HN1 to other cancer types.
The PKCq inhibitory module was shown to selectively block the
translocation of active PKCq in numerous cell types, including
cardiac myocytes, pancreatic h-cells, and neuronal cells (19, 23, 24).
There is evidence to indicate that inactive PKCq is localized in the
cytoplasmic fraction and on activation translocates to the
particulate fraction (25, 26). To determine if HN1-PKCq can block
the translocation of active PKCq in HNSCC cells, UMSCC1 cells
were untreated or incubated with HN1-control or HN1-PKCq for
24 hours. Subsequently, cells were activated with PMA and cell
lysates were fractionated for cytoplasmic and particulate proteins.
As shown in Fig. 3A, active PKCq is dramatically lower in HN1PKCq–treated cells than in untreated or HN1-control–treated cells.
These results provide direct evidence that HN1-PKCq disrupts the
proper localization of PKCq, resulting in ‘‘normalization’’ of active
PKCq levels in HNSCC cells.
We determined the effects of HN1-PKCq on cell invasion, cell
motility, and cell proliferation. UMSCC1 cells were untreated
or incubated with 30 Amol/L HN1-control and HN1-PKCq for
72 hours. Subsequently, cells were trypsinized and replated in
appropriate experimental wells to assess for cell invasion and cell

motility. UMSCC1 cells treated with HN1-PKCq were significantly
less invasive and motile than untreated cells or HN1-control–
treated cells (Fig. 3B and C). HN1-PKCq inhibited cell invasion by
72 F 2% (P < 0.001, n = 12) and cell motility was suppressed
by 56 F 2% (P < 0.001, n = 5) in UMSCC1 cells. As shown in
Fig. 3D, the effects of HN1-PKCq on cell proliferation as
monotherapy or in combination therapy with cis-platinum were
assessed. As expected, cis-platinum (no peptide treatment)
inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, ranging
from 3 F 1% inhibition for 1 Amol/L to 49 F 2% inhibition for
10 Amol/L. HN1-control (30 Amol/L for 72 hours) had no effect
on cell proliferation as monotherapy, and no additional effect
was observed in combination with cis-platinum. Single-agent
treatment of HN1-PKCq (30 Amol/L for 72 hours) significantly
inhibited cell proliferation by 39 F 2%, and, moreover, used in a
combination treatment regimen, an additive effect is observed with
cis-platinum. Single-agent cis-platinum (10 Amol/L for 72 hours)
inhibited cell proliferation by 49 F 2%, whereas the combination
regimen of 30 Amol/L HN1-PKCq and 10 Amol/L cis-platinum for
72 hours inhibited cell proliferation by 72 F 4%. The combination
regimen resulted in a 47% increase in inhibition of cell proliferation
compared with single-agent cis-platinum treatment. This observation supports the notion that the combination regimen of a PKCq
inhibitor and cis-platinum is more efficacious than either singleagent therapy alone. It is critical to point out that the HN1
module does not have anticancer properties, as the HN1-control
peptide had no effect on cell invasion, motility, and proliferation.
These observations strongly indicate that the PKCq inhibitory
module is solely responsible for the antitumor effects as observed
in these phenotypic experiments.
The antitumor efficacy of HN1-PKCq was assessed in a
xenograft model of HNSCC. UMSCC1 cells were infected with a
lentivirus expression vector to drive constitutive Firefly luciferase
(pLentilox-Luc) to allow us to measure tumor response using a
highly sensitive and dynamic in vivo bioluminescence imaging
modality. UMSCC1-luciferase cells (1  106) were implanted into
the flank of 10-week-old athymic nude mice, and tumors were
allowed to develop without treatment. At 2 weeks after implantation, mice with established tumors of f40 mm3 in volume were
imaged for bioluminescence intensity. Mice were randomly
assigned to three treatment groups, untreated (n = 9), HN1-control
(10 mg/kg i.p. injection, thrice weekly, n = 8), or HN1-PKCq
(10 mg/kg i.p. injection, thrice weekly, n = 11), based on
bioluminescence intensity to achieve a statistically similar mean
bioluminescence intensity at the start of the treatment protocol.
At the end of the 4-week treatment protocol, mean tumor
bioluminescence intensity between the untreated arm and
HN1-control–treated arm was statistically similar (P > 0.05): 15.2
F 5.2 photons/s for the untreated mice and 11.0 F 3.9 photons/s
for the HN1-control–treated mice (Fig. 4B). Mice from the HN1PKCq treatment arm showed a dramatic difference and had a mean
tumor bioluminescence intensity of only 1.9 F 0.9 photons/s. Mean
tumor bioluminescence intensity was f5.8-fold higher in the
HN1-control arm in comparison with the HN1-PKCq arm (P < 0.02).
As shown in Fig. 4C, immunohistochemical staining indicated that
HN1-PKCq treatment resulted in a 71 F 8% decrease in the tumor
proliferation index and a 314 F 29% increase in the tumor
apoptotic index compared with HN1-control treatment (P < 0.001).
Additionally, pStat3 (S727) levels, a downstream target of active
PKCq, were markedly lower in the tumors from the HN1-PKCq
arm than from the untreated or HN1-control arm. These in vivo

results show a robust antitumor effect with HN1-PKCq treatment
in HNSCC.
The paradigm of molecularly targeted anticancer therapies is
beginning to take hold. To date, several molecularly targeted
anticancer therapies, such as bevacizumab and cetuximab, have
proven to be effective approaches for managing cancer patients.
Many of these molecularly targeted anticancer agents have shown
to be more selective for cancer cells and thus exhibit lower overall
toxicity profiles than standard chemotherapeutics. Nevertheless,
dose-limiting toxicities, most likely due to drug delivery to
nontarget cells and organs, remain a critical issue even with
molecularly targeted anticancer drugs. Development of a bifunctional anticancer drug consisting of a molecularly targeted
therapeutic and a tumor-targeting component will enable the
specific delivery of an anticancer therapeutic to tumor cells,
resulting in increased local efficacy while limiting peripheral
toxicity. HN1-PKCq was conceived with these two criteria in mind.
Our results clearly show that HN1-PKCq is functioning as designed
and selectively penetrates HNSCC cells to inhibit active PKCq
translocation. Systemic administration of HN1-PKCq significantly
retarded the growth of HNSCC xenograft as measured by a highly

sensitive in vivo bioluminescence imaging modality. There was no
apparent difference in the weight of untreated, HN1-control–
treated, and HN1-PKCq–treated mice during the active treatment
period, providing initial evidence that HN1-PKCq has a favorable
toxicity profile. Taken together, this study indicates that HN1-PKCq
has potent antitumor effects and further development of HN1PKCq as an anticancer therapeutic for HNSCC is warranted.
