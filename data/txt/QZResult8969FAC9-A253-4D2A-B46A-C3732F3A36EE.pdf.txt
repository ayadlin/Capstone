BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia has been associated with prolonged survival selectively in patients on a conventional schedule (combined 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin [FOLFOX2]) but not on a chronomodulated schedule of the same
drugs administered at specific circadian times (chronoFLO4). The authors hypothesized that the early occurrence of chemotherapyinduced symptoms correlated with circadian disruption would selectively hinder the efficacy of chronotherapy. METHODS: Fatigue and
weight loss (FWL) were considered to be associated with circadian disruption based on previous data. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (n 5 543) from an international phase 3 trial comparing FOLFOX2 with chronoFLO4 were categorized into 4 subgroups
according to the occurrence of FWL or other clinically relevant toxicities during the initial 2 courses of chemotherapy. Multivariate
Cox models were used to assess the role of toxicity on the time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The proportions of patients in the 4 subgroups were comparable in both treatment arms (P 5.77). No toxicity was associated with TTP or OS on
FOLFOX2. The median OS on FOLFOX2 ranged from 16.4 (95% confidence limits [CL], 7.2-25.6 months) to 19.8 months (95% CL, 17.722.0 months) according to toxicity subgroup (P 5.45). Conversely, FWL, but no other toxicity, independently predicted for significantly shorter TTP (P <.0001) and OS (P 5.001) on chronoFLO4. The median OS on chronoFLO4 was 13.8 months (95% CL, 10.4-17.2
months) or 21.1 months (95% CL, 19.0-23.1 months) according to presence or absence of chemotherapy-induced FWL, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Early onset chemotherapy-induced FWL was an independent predictor of poor TTP and OS only on chronotherapy.
Dynamic monitoring to detect early chemotherapy-induced circadian disruption could allow the optimization of rapid chronotherapy

INTRODUCTION
The correlation between chemotherapy-induced toxicity and efficacy has been investigated extensively in patients with
various cancers at different disease stages. Consequently, the current thinking is that adverse events are valid surrogate
markers of adequate chemotherapy exposure.1 Thus, clinical studies have repeatedly demonstrated that a lack of drugspecific toxicities is associated with poor survival outcomes.2-9 For instance, neutropenia was reported as an independent
predictor of prolonged survival in patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.5,10 We recently

confirmed this finding in patients who were receiving a
conventional schedule of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and
oxaliplatin (FOLFOX2) in an international randomized
trial.10 However, no positive relation between neutropenia and survival was observed in patients who were receiving a circadian-based schedule involving the
chronomodulated delivery of the same drugs at selected
times of day or night (chronoFLO4).10 Moreover, the
delivery of chronoFLO4 significantly prolonged overall
survival (OS) in men compared with FOLFOX2, but it
significantly reduced survival in women.11 These findings
were confirmed in a meta-analysis of 3 international
randomized trials.12 Experimental data indeed support
paying careful and specific attention to optimal circadian
dosing of anticancer drugs, and maximal antitumor efficacy usually results from chemotherapy administered near
the circadian time corresponding to best tolerability.13
Circadian rhythms are generated within each cell by molecular clocks, which consist of interwoven transcription/
translation feedback loops.13,14 The molecular clocks, in
turn, are coordinated by an array of physiologic rhythms
generated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei, a circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamus.13-15 The circadian timing
system encompasses these molecular, cellular, and physiologic components and generates 24-hour rhythms in anticancer drug metabolism and cellular proliferation.13,15,16
The circadian timing system in cancer patients has been
assessed with continuous rest-activity monitoring using a
wrist actigraph, which detected circadian disruption in
approximately 1 in 3 cancer patients.17,18 In a previous
work, baseline circadian disruption was associated
robustly with fatigue and appetite loss in 251 patients
with metastatic colorectal cancer.17-19 Fatigue and appetite loss also were observed in individuals who were suffering from jet lag or who were engaged in shift work—2
conditions that disrupt the circadian timing system.20,21
Moreover, fatigue and body weight loss, objective yet
unspecific measures of appetite loss, occurred more frequently in cancer patients who had circadian alterations
on chemotherapy.22 Body weight loss also was associated
with decreased physical activity in patients undergoing
actigraphy monitoring.23 For the current investigation,
we hypothesized that early onset fatigue and/or weight
loss reflect chemotherapy-induced circadian disruption, a
condition that interferes selectively with the efficacy of
chronomodulated chemotherapy. To probe this hypothesis, we performed a post hoc analysis of data prospectively
collected for an international, randomized, phase 3 trial
(European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer [EORTC] 05963) that was conducted in 564

chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer who were randomized to receive first-line chemotherapy with either chronoFLO4 or FOLFOX2.11
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Objectives

For the current study, we examined the primary hypothesis that early onset fatigue and body weight loss, occurring
during the initial 4 weeks of treatment, selectively indicate
a poor prognosis for the survival of patients who are
receiving a fixed chronotherapy schedule for metastatic
colorectal cancer. This symptom cluster was selected as
being related to the occurrence of circadian disruption in
cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy.10 Secondary objectives included the prognostic relevance of
other main, severe toxicities that have no known association with circadian disruption.10,17-19
Study Population and Chemotherapy Schedules

Patients with chemotherapy-naive, metastatic colorectal
cancer were enrolled in the EORTC 05963 trial between
October 1998 and February 2002.11 They provided written informed consent and were randomized to receive
first-line chemotherapy with combined fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin either as a chronomodulated
infusion (chronoFLO4) or with a conventional, non
time-stipulated schedule (FOLFOX2). Details of these
schedules have been described elsewhere.11
Study Population and Toxicity Evaluation

The landmark population in this study involved patients
who received at least 2 courses of chemotherapy according
to EORTC 05963. This time span covered the initial 4
weeks on chemotherapy. Clinical and hematologic toxicities were graded after each treatment course according to
the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria,
version 2.0. Fatigue and appetite loss were rated by the
physician. Whereas chemotherapy-induced fatigue was
reported after each course, appetite loss was not systematically assessed. However, body weight was measured systematically before each chemotherapy course and was
chosen as a surrogate quantitative indicator of decreased
appetite. We considered toxicity clinically meaningful if
the patient experienced either grade 2 fatigue or weight
loss 5% of baseline body weight over the initial 2
courses of chemotherapy. The clinical relevance of the
cutoff values selected a priori for our study has been
described elsewhere.8,22,24
The following toxicities were not considered to be
associated with circadian disruption: diarrhea, stomatitis,
2565

Original Article

mucositis, hand-foot syndrome, peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. To distinguish the respective
impact of each type of toxicity, patients in each treatment
group were categorized into 4 subgroups according to the
occurrence of no toxicity (subgroup 1), fatigue-weight
loss only (subgroup 2), fatigue-weight loss associated with
other grade 3 toxic events (subgroup 3), or other grade
3 toxicities only (subgroup 4).
Statistical Methods

The primary endpoint of the current study was the association between toxicity and OS, defined as the time
between the end (day 14) of the second treatment course
and the date of death irrespective of cause. Patients who
remained alive at the time the database was locked or who
were lost to follow-up were censored on the date of last information on vital status. At that date, after a median follow-up of 87 months (range, 68-108 months), 488 events
had occurred (89.9%).
The proportions of patients in each toxicity subgroup were computed for each treatment modality. The
rates were compared with a 2-sided chi-square test. Actual
dose intensities (per square meter per week) received in
the first 2 courses of chemotherapy and throughout the
whole treatment span were compared between the 4
patient categories with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney
U test. The survival functions of the 4 subgroups, as
defined by the occurrence of fatigue-weight loss and/or
other toxicities after the initial 2 treatment courses, were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared using a log-rank test separately in each treatment
arm. The hazard ratio (HR) of an earlier death associated
with the occurrence of toxicity was estimated using Cox
proportional hazards models separately in each treatment
arm. Multivariate prognostic models for OS included
other parameters that were force-entered, whereas toxicity
category was conditionally added. In the first step, parameters that predicted the occurrence of any clinically relevant toxicity (fatigue-weight loss and/or other toxicities)
were identified with a thorough screening of clinical features using a binary logistic univariate regression model.
The characteristics included sex, age, baseline body mass
index, World Health Organization performance status at
inclusion, the number of metastatic sites, the percentage
of liver involvement by tumor, dose intensities of 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin over the first 2 cycles, previous adjuvant chemotherapy, Duke stage at diagnosis, primary
tumor site, surgical resection of the primary tumor, previous surgery for metastases, baseline leukocyte count, and
2566

baseline alkaline phosphatase level. Upon verification of
the absence of colinearity (r  0.37), these parameters
were added in a block to the prognostic model. For the
second step, the subgroup category according to toxicity
occurrence was added to the multivariate model. The
same statistical procedure was performed to examine the
independent predictive role of chemotherapy-induced
toxicity on the time to progression (TTP), which was calculated from the end of the second course until documented disease progression, death, or last contact,
whichever occurred first. A similar multivariate Cox hazard regression model was performed separately using the
occurrence of fatigue-weight loss and the occurrence of
other toxicities as covariates to validate the specificity of
either toxicity on TTP and OS for each treatment modality. Further sensitivity analyses were performed excluding
patients with missing data. Because 2 independent models
were fitted for FOLFOX2 and chronoFLO4 modalities,
the threshold for statistically significant differences was set
at P  .025 according to a Bonferroni correction. The rate
of missing data per item for the parameters considered
(blood counts, clinical toxicities, and body weight) after
the first 2 courses of chemotherapy was of 1.3%. Sensitivity analyses performed that eliminated patients who had
at least 1 missing item yielded results that were strictly
comparable to those reported in the main landmark group
(data not reported). All analyses were performed using
PASW Statistics 18 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).
Study Population

Of 564 enrolled and randomized patients in the EORTC
05963 trial, 543 patients (96.3%) received at least 2
courses of chemotherapy and constituted the study population (Fig. 1). The clinical and demographic features of
the 272 patients who received FOLFOX2 and the 271
patients who received chronoFLO4 are presented according to the occurrence of fatigue-body weight loss and
other toxicities (data not shown).
RESULTS
Dose Intensities and Toxicities

The actual dose intensities of 5-fluororucacil and oxaliplatin over the initial 2 treatment courses varied according to
the toxicity category in the FOLFOX2 schedule
(P 5 .008 and P 5 .001, respectively), but not in the
chronoFLO4 schedule (P 5 .24 and P 5 .20, respectively). Fatigue-weight loss was encountered in 73 patients
(26.8%) in the FOLFOX2 group and 69 patients
(25.5%) in the chronoFLO4 group (P 5 .72), whereas
other toxicities occurred in 40 patients (14.7%) and 54

patients (19.9%), respectively (P 5 .11) (Fig. 2). The cooccurrence of fatigue-weight loss and other toxicities was
significantly more frequent in the chronoFLO4 group
(n 5 27; 10.0%) than in the FOLFOX2 group (n 5 14;
5.1%; P 5 .036). The relative proportions of patients in
each of the 4 toxicity categories did not differ according to
treatment modality with statistical significance (P 5 .07)
(Fig. 2). Women who received chronoFLO4 were significantly more likely to develop toxicity than men who
received chronoFLO4 (P 5 .003) (Table 1). Patients with
good baseline performance status displayed a significantly
reduced risk of experiencing toxicity after either treatment
schedule (Table 1). The regimen and dosing of supportive
medications, including steroids, were similar in both
treatment arms.11
Tumor Response and Progression-Free Survival

Objective response rates were similar in the 4 toxicity categories for patients in the FOLFOX2 group (P 5 .80)
(Table 2). Conversely, an objective response was achieved

toxicities on chronoFLO4 compared with from 40.5% up
to 51.9% of patients in the other toxicity subgroups
(P 5 .06) (Table 2).
The 4 toxicity categories displayed similar curves for
TTP for patients who received FOLFOX2 (log-rank test;
P 5 .11) (Fig. 3A). Conversely, a significant difference in
TTP was observed according to toxicity category among
the patients who received chronoFLO4 (log-rank test;
P < .0001). The patients with fatigue-weight loss displayed the worst outcome, irrespective of the association
of this symptom cluster with other toxicities (Fig. 3B).
This translated into a higher risk of earlier progression on
chronoFLO4 for patients with fatigue-weight loss, either
alone (P < .0001) or combined with other toxicities
(P 5 .001). No such relation was observed among patients
who had toxicities other than fatigue-weight loss
(P 5 .59). Fatigue-weight loss was confirmed as an independent prognostic indicator of the risk of earlier progression on chronoFLO4 using the multivariate Cox model
(P < .001). No such correlation was validated for the
patients who had toxicities other than fatigue-weight loss

results not shown) in the chronoFLO4 group. The multivariate Cox model ruled out other clinical toxicities as predictors of OS (P 5 .08; results not shown). However, the
fatigue-weight loss cluster remained a statistically significant predictor of poor survival in this analysis (P 5 .001).
DISCUSSION
This study revealed that the advent of fatigue or weight loss
during the initial 4 weeks on chemotherapy predicted poor
progression-free survival and OS on a fixed chronotherapy
schedule in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. No
such relation was observed between these symptoms and efficacy outcomes in patients who received conventional
chemotherapy. The current study also demonstrated no
predictive value of other severe clinical toxicities for any efficacy outcome regardless of the delivery schedule. Thus, the
current report constitutes the first clinical proof of a negative relation between toxicity and both TTP and survival in
2570

oncology. Prior studies consistently reported a positive association between specific toxicities and clinical outcomes in
patients who received various chemotherapies for many
kinds of malignancies.2-9 The specificity of the current finding for chronotherapy delivery supports a shared circadian
biologic mechanism correlating poor anticancer activity
with poor tolerability.13 Fatigue-weight loss was highlighted here as a critical symptom cluster that may impair
the efficacy of chronotherapy. Fatigue, anorexia, and body
weight loss are frequent chemotherapy-induced complaints
that often cluster and may share common mechanisms.19,22,25-28 Prior studies supported the hypothesis that
the fatigue-weight loss symptom cluster would result from
circadian disruption.19,22 Therefore, we chose the occurrence of this cluster of systemic toxicity as an indirect surrogate for chemotherapy-induced circadian disruption.
In the current work, no difference in overall toxicity
rates during the initial 2 courses of treatment was observed
as a function of treatment schedule (Fig. 2). However,
early toxicities on chronoFLO4 were almost twice as frequent in women compared with men. Hence, the higher
toxicity incidence in women may have been particularly
detrimental for the efficacy of chronomodulated chemotherapy, which is based biologically on a coordinated,

functional biologic clock.13-16,29 Thus, wrongly dosed or
poorly timed circadian chemotherapy could disrupt both
the central pacemaker and the peripheral oscillators,
resulting in symptoms of circadian disruption (fatigue,
anorexia, weight loss) and toxic effects in peripheral tissues, which are equipped with functional molecular
clocks.16,30,31

The current findings indicate that chemotherapyinduced circadian disruption, as estimated here with the
occurrence of fatigue or weight loss, may be detrimental
for the efficacy of circadian-based chemotherapy. This is
not be the case, however, for conventional chemotherapy,
in which the timing of administration varies both between
and within patients.13

Original Article

Two main limitations of the current study should be
acknowledged. First, patients were not randomized to develop toxicity. Therefore, it may be argued that other factors associated with fatigue-weight loss or other
toxicities would be the main determinants of the survival differences observed, and toxic events would
merely form a surrogate marker of a poor prognosis
related to other determinants. To rule out this possibility, we systematically proceeded with a thorough
screening of all parameters that possibly might account
for the induction of either toxicity. All factors were forcibly added to the Cox survival model, whereas the
toxicity subgroup category was added conditionally to
the model to explore whether it had independent prognostic value above and beyond the other parameters
considered. Indeed, the occurrence of chemotherapyinduced fatigue-weight loss remained an independent
prognostic factor for both TTP and OS in the chronoFLO4 group despite the adjustment for the other parameters and known prognostic factors. This analysis
confirmed the prognostic relevance of sex for chronotherapy12 along with the relevance of PS and alkaline
phosphatase for conventional chemotherapy32,33 (Table
3). Second, the grading of fatigue is subjective, with
uncertain reliability and reproducibility. However, in 2
large meta-analyses that included individual data
reporting subjective parameters, PS or patient self-estimated quality-of-life measures at baseline independently predicted OS.33,34 Thus, pertinent subjective
parameters added relevant prognostic information to
that derived from objective measures.
Furthermore, circadian function can be quantified
both noninvasively and objectively in cancer patients
using wrist actimetry monitoring.17,18,35 The early detection of circadian disruption indeed may readily help its
minimization through the modification of drug doses
and/or timing administration, resulting in personalized
rather than fixed chronotherapy schedules.
In conclusion, the patients who displayed fatigueweight loss within the initial 4 weeks of a fixed chronotherapy schedule were less likely to benefit from it. This
finding provides a clinically relevant tool for further treatment optimization, which also may benefit from a quantitative dynamic approach based on circadian rhythm
monitoring. A main implication of the current study,
which deserves prospective validation, is that circadianbased schedules should achieve low toxicity to optimize efficacy, a finding that also has been supported experimentally.13 This paradigm seems to be specific for
chronotherapy. It contrasts with the current concept of
2572

conventional chemotherapy, in which the maximum tolerated dose of an anticancer drug represents the optimal
therapeutic dose.
