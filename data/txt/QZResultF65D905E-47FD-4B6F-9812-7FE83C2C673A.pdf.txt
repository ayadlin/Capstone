ABSTRACT
TRAP1 is a HSP90 molecular chaperone upregulated in colorectal carcinomas and
involved in control of intracellular signaling, cell cycle, apoptosis and drug resistance,
stemness and bioenergetics through co-traslational regulation of a network of client
proteins. Thus, the clinical significance of TRAP1 protein network was analyzed
in human colorectal cancers. TRAP1 and/or its client proteins were quantified, by
immunoblot analysis, in 60 surgical specimens of colorectal carcinomas at different
stages and, by immunohistochemistry, in 9 colorectal adenomatous polyps, 11 in
situ carcinomas and 55 metastatic colorectal tumors. TRAP1 is upregulated at the
transition between low- and high-grade adenomas, in in situ carcinomas and in about
60% of human colorectal carcinomas, being downregulated only in a small cohort of
tumors. The analysis of TCGA database showed that a subgroup of colorectal tumors
is characterized by gain/loss of TRAP1 copy number, this correlating with its mRNA
and protein expression. Interestingly, TRAP1 is co-expressed with the majority of
its client proteins and hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the upregulation of
TRAP1 and associated 6-protein signature (i.e., IF2α, eF1A, TBP7, MAD2, CDK1 and
βCatenin) identifies a cohort of metastatic colorectal carcinomas with a significantly
shorter overall survival (HR 5.4; 95% C.I. 1.1-26.6; p=0.037). Consistently, the
prognostic relevance of TRAP1 was confirmed in a cohort of 55 metastatic colorectal
tumors. Finally, TRAP1 positive expression and its prognostic value are more evident
in left colon cancers. These data suggest that TRAP1 protein network may provide a
prognostic signature in human metastatic colorectal carcinomas.

treatments [4].
TRAP1 is a HSP90 molecular chaperone upregulated
in several human malignancies [5, 6] and, among others,
human CRC [7]. High TRAP1 levels have been proposed
as prognostic biomarker in this malignancy, being
associated with extensive lymph node dissemination [8]
and, together with high ERCC1, with poor overall survival
(OS) in metastatic disease [9]. TRAP1 is responsible
for several functions of cancer cells, i.e. protection from
stress and apoptosis, drug resistance, protein homeostasis,
maintenance of stemness, intracellular signaling, cell
migration, cell cycle regulation, and bioenergetics [5, 7,
10–19]. TRAP1 regulation of these cell functions depends
on the co-translational quality control of specific client
proteins and, thus, the modulation of the expression/
ubiquitination of a network of proteins [11, 12]. In such a
context, we previously suggested that human CRCs with
increased TRAP1 expression are characterized by selective
upregulation of specific TRAP1 network proteins [6, 13, 20,
21], even though the clinical significance of this regulation
is still largely unexplored [6]. Thus, this study was designed
to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the biological and
clinical relevance of TRAP1 protein network in human
CRC and to address the hypothesis that the coordinated
upregulation of TRAP1 and its client proteins may serve as
a prognostic signature in metastatic disease.

Since previous data in human ovarian carcinoma
suggest that TRAP1 expression is dependent on genetic
alterations regarding its gene copy number [22] the
hypothesis that TRAP1 modulation in human CRC
depends on transcriptional mechanisms was evaluated by
analyzing the TCGA database. Data from two independent
series (TCGA Cohorts 1 and 2) were used to establish
the relationship between TRAP1 copy number and its
mRNA expression (Figure 2). Interestingly, the vast
majority of human CRCs exhibited a diploid TRAP1
genotype, with a cohort (ranging between 18 and 23%
of cases) characterized by gain in TRAP1 copy number
and a small subgroup (ranging between 3 and 9%) by
TRAP1 gene shallow deletion (Figure 2A). The statistical
analysis of both datasets showed a significant difference
in TRAP1 mRNA expression levels according to TRAP1
copy number (Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.0001 in Cohort_1 and
p=0.0003 in Cohort_2; Figure 2B–2C) and a significant
correlation between TRAP1 mRNA expression and its
copy number linear level [Spearman, R=0.32 (95% C.I.
0.19 – 0.43) p<0.0001 in Cohort_1, Spearman, R=0.16
(95% C.I. 0.05 – 0.25), p=0.003 in Cohort_2; Figure 2D–
2E]. In addition, a statistically significant correlation was
observed between TRAP1 copy number linear level and its
protein expression in TGCA Cohort 2 (Spearman, R=0.31
(95% C.I. 0.1 – 0.48), p=0.004; Supplementary Figure
2). These data suggest that TRAP1 expression partially
depends on transcriptional mechanisms in CRCs.

RESULTS

TRAP1 is co-expressed with its client proteins

TRAP1 upregulation is an early event in human
colorectal carcinogenesis and is partially
dependent on transcriptional mechanisms

In further analysis, the expression levels of TRAP1
client proteins previously characterized by our group
(i.e., F1ATPase, TBP7, IF2α, EF1G, IF4A, IF4E, EF1A,
BRAF, AKT, 18kDa Sorcin, CDK1, MAD2, βCatenin)
[11–13, 18, 20, 21] were comparatively evaluated, by
immunoblot analysis, in the study cohort of 60 human
CRCs (Supplementary Figure 1). Interestingly, Spearman
Rank correlation test showed a statistically significant coexpression between TRAP1 and most of its client proteins
(Table 2), being the statistical significance lacking only for
F1ATPase and 18KDa Sorcin. In addition, a reciprocal coexpression was observed between the majority of TRAP1
client proteins (Supplementary Figure 3).

To address the relevance of TRAP1 in colorectal
carcinogenesis, its expression was analyzed, by
immunohistochemistry, in 9 colon adenomatous polyps with
different grading and 11 in situ carcinomas. Interestingly,
TRAP1 is upregulated at the transition between low- and
high-grade adenomas, being the latter characterized by
increased levels of TRAP1 in 4/6 cases (Figure 1A–1B)
and is upregulated in 7/11 in situ carcinomas (Figure 1C).
TRAP1 expression was further evaluated, by immunoblot
analysis, in 60 human CRCs at different stages and in the
respective non-infiltrated normal colon mucosa (study
cohort – Table 1). Indeed, TRAP1 upregulation was
observed in 63% of cases, being its expression unchanged
or downregulated in, respectively, 24% and 13% of tumors
(Figure 1D–1F and Supplementary Figure 1). No correlation
was observed between TRAP1 expression and TNM stage,
tumor grade and lymph node dissemination (Figure 1D
and Supplementary Table 1). In addition, TRAP1 protein
expression was analyzed, by immunohistochemistry, in
selective TRAP1-positive tumors in comparison with
respective lymph node and distant metastases and no major
differences were observed (Figure 1G–1H).

TRAP1 proteome network predicts poor
outcome in human metastatic CRCs
To analyze the prognostic significance of TRAP1
proteome, a hierarchical cluster analysis was used to
obtain the segregation of our study cohort in independent
clusters, according to the expression of TRAP1 client
proteins. Interestingly, the concomitant expression of
TRAP1 and eight clients proteins (concomitant up- versus
down-regulation of BRAF, βCatenin, CDK1, MAD2,
EF1G, EF1A, TBP7, IF2α) segregated CRCs in two

major clusters not showing any association with TNM
stage, lymph node involvement and grading (Figure 3A),
neither with overall survival (data not shown). Thus,
cluster segregation analysis was separately performed
in TNM stage II, III and IV tumors (Figure 3B–3D).
Noteworthy, TRAP1 proteomic signature segregated each
subgroup in two independent clusters (Figure 3B–3D),
and in stage IV mCRCs the concurrent positive/negative
expression of TRAP1 and six of its client proteins (i.e.,
βCatenin, CDK1, MAD2, EF1A, TBP7, IF2α) allowed the
segregation of tumors in clusters with different outcome.
Indeed, Kaplan and Maier analysis showed significantly
different OS curves in mCRCs with differential expression
of either TRAP1 and associated 6-protein signature (HR
5.4; 95% C.I. 1.1-26.6; p=0.037; Figure 3E–3F) or TRAP1

itself (HR 3.8; 95% C.I. 1.1-12.9; p=0.032; Figure 3G).
Interestingly, the upregulation of each TRAP1 client
protein separately identified tumors with worst OS, but
differences in OS curves did not reach the statistical
significance (Figure 4A–4E).
The prognostic significance of TRAP1 was further
validated upon analysis of a validation cohort of 55 mCRCs
treated with standard first line chemotherapy (oxaliplatinor irinotecan-based chemotherapy ± anti-EGFR or antiVEGF antibodies; Table 1). Thus, TRAP1 expression was
quantified by immunohistochemistry, yielding 80% of cases
with TRAP1 upregulation (Figure 5A). TRAP1 positive
expression identified a cohort of mCRCs with a shorter
PFS after first line chemotherapy compared to tumors with
negative/low TRAP1 expression, even though this difference

relevance of TRAP1 prognostic value was evaluated in a
combined cohort of 73 mCRCs, including all patients from
the validation cohort and the subgroup of mCRCs from
the study cohort. Interestingly, TRAP1 positive expression
is enriched in left versus right CRCs, even though this
difference is not fully significant (Figure 6A). In addition,
overall survival curves confirmed the prognostic value of
TRAP1 expression in the whole cohort (HR 3.0; 95% C.I.
1.1-8.1; p=0.03; Figure 6B) and in left colon CRCs (HR
3.03; 95% C.I. 1.05-8.7; p=0.04; Figure 6C). By contrast,
the statistical significance in overall survival between
TRAP1-positive and negative tumors is lost in right colon
cancers (HR 2.65; 95% C.I. 0.8-8.6; p=0.1; Figure 6D),
even though the lack of significance is likely due to the
low number of right colon cancers in our series.

Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease respect to
molecular profiles, drug response and clinical outcome [24].
Several attempts have been made to obtain gene expressionbased classifications of human CRC and facilitate their
clinical translation [2, 25]. However, at present, none of
them produced clinically meaningful tools to enter daily
clinical practice [3] and only the mutational status of specific
genes (i.e., KRAS, NRAS and BRAF) is routinely used for
treatment selection [24]. In such a context, we recently
reported that i) the HSP90 molecular chaperone TRAP1
is upregulated in human CRCs [7], ii) its gene signature
is associated to the stem like phenotype [18], and iii) its
silencing results in the loss of the stem-like signature with

acquisition of a more differentiated phenotype [18]. Since
these evidences suggest that TRAP1 upregulation correlates
with loss of differentiation and poor outcome in human CRC,
this study was designed to address the clinical relevance of
TRAP1 client protein network in human CRC. Our results
show that: i) TRAP1 upregulation occurs at the transition
between low- and high-grade adenomatous polyps, ii)
human CRCs with high TRAP1 levels show a concomitant
upregulation of TRAP1 client proteins network; iii) the

is prevalent in left colon carcinomas.
It is intriguing that TRAP1 upregulation occurs at
early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis, being already
evident in high-grade adenomas and in in situ carcinomas.
This evidence is consistent with previous studies showing
that TRAP1 is upregulated in both dysplastic and nondysplastic tissues of ulcerative colitis progressors, being
its levels lower in colon tissues from ulcerative colitis
non-progressors [26]. In addition, TRAP1-silenced colon

carcinoma cells exhibited lack of clonogenic ability in
vitro and tumor formation in mice xenografts [15], thus
supporting the relevance of TRAP1 in early phases of colon
carcinogenesis. It is also noteworthy that about 60% of
human CRCs with high TRAP1 expression are characterized
by the parallel upregulation of a network of proteins involved
in several cell functions, critical for colon carcinogenesis [5,
10, 11, 13, 14, 18, 27, 28]. Thus, it is intriguing to speculate
that TRAP1 upregulation may represent an early mechanism
used by colon cancer cells to adapt to unfavorable
environmental conditions and, thus, activate a number of
pathways responsible for malignant transformation and
tumor progression. This hypothesis is reinforced by previous
evidences suggesting a crosstalk between TRAP1 and RAF/
ERK pathway [13, 29] and TRAP1 regulation on Wnt/
βCatenin signaling [18], two key pathways activated at early
stages during colorectal carcinogenesis [31]. Altogether,
these data support the concept that TRAP1 network should
be acknowledged among signaling pathways responsible for
colorectal transformation and progression.
Noteworthy, a small subgroup of colon cancers is
characterized by TRAP1 levels below normal mucosa.
The biological relevance of this observation is unclear,
even though it is consistent with recent data showing
that selected human malignancies (i.e., ovarian, cervical

and renal carcinomas) are characterized by low TRAP1
expression [17] and that TRAP1 downregulation induces
activation of oxidative metabolism and cisplatin resistance
in ovarian carcinoma [30]. Thus, it is likely that human
CRCs up/downregulate TRAP1 to adapt their fate to
metabolic/environmental requirements, even though the
significance of TRAP1 downregulation in selected CRCs
is an issue that requires further investigation.
A major question is the mechanism used by cancer
cells to modulate TRAP1 expression. The analysis of
the TCGA database shows that the vast majority of
human CRCs are characterized by a diploid TRAP1
genotype, with a subgroup, ranging between 21 and
32%, characterized by loss/gain of TRAP1 copy number.
Interestingly, TRAP1 copy number variation correlates
with its mRNA/protein expression, suggesting that
genomic alterations may account for up/downregulation
of TRAP1 expression only in a subgroup of human CRCs.
Considering that TRAP1 protein level is upregulated in
about 60% and downregulated in 13% of human CRCs,
it is evident that posttranslational mechanism are also
responsible for TRAP1 modulation. In such a perspective,
a recent study demonstrated that S-nitrosylation is a major
posttranslational modification responsible for regulation
of TRAP1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma [32].

Thus, further study are required to address the relationship
between TRAP1 protein expression and gene copy number
and the relevance of posttranslational modifications in
TRAP1 regulation in human CRC.
The clinical relevance of TRAP1 signature in CRC
was addressed by analyzing two independent cohorts
of tumors. Indeed, TRAP1 expression itself as well as
TRAP1 and its associated 6-protein signature predicted
shorter OS in mCRCs in both the study cohort and in a
separate cohort of 55 mCRCs treated with standard firstline chemotherapy. Noteworthy, TRAP1 prognostic value
is significantly evident in patients who did not receive
surgical resection of distant metastases, this supporting the
hypothesis that the activation of TRAP1 network enhances
the malignant potential and the clinical aggressiveness of
human CRCs. Finally, TRAP1 capacity to predict poor
prognosis were shown to be conserved in left CRCs,
thus supporting the hypothesis that the upregulation of
TRAP1 protein network may represent a further biological
difference between right and left colon cancers.
These observations are consistent with previous
studies suggesting that high TRAP1 expression correlates
with lymph node metastases [8] and, together with
ERCC1, with poor OS in mCRC treated with oxaliplatin/5fluorouracil chemotherapy [9]. While our data did not
confirm the association between TRAP1 and lymph node
metastasis, they provide clear evidence that TRAP1 client
protein network may be regarded as prognostic biomarker
to drive clinical decisions in metastatic setting, even though
several issues still needs to be addressed/confirmed in this
perspective. Indeed, TRAP1 protein signature requires a
further validation in a prospective larger clinical trial respect
to specific therapy regimens (standard chemotherapy vs
chemotherapy combined with molecular-targeted agents). In
addition, the significance of TRAP1 prognostic value respect
to primary tumor site (left versus right colon) requires further
confirmation since our data do not rule out the hypothesis
that the lack of full significance in right colon cancer OS
curves may depend on the low number of right colon
carcinomas in our series. Finally, it is important to establish
whether the evaluation of specific client proteins together
with TRAP1 provides additional prognostic information
compared to TRAP1 alone.
In conclusion, this study provides the first
comprehensive proteomic evaluation of TRAP1 protein
network in colorectal tumors, showing the clinical
relevance of its activation as a mechanism to coordinate
a number of signaling pathway responsible for tumor
progression and clinical aggressiveness.

of 60 CRCs at different TNM stages and corresponding
normal, non-infiltrated peritumoral mucosa was obtained
from the General Surgery Unit of the University of
Foggia. Specimens were collected after surgical removal
of tumors and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The
validation cohort of 55 paraffin-embedded metastatic
CRCs (mCRCs) was obtained from the Pathology Unit
of the IRCCS-CROB. Paraffin-embedded colorectal
adenomatous polyps and in situ carcinomas were also
obtained by the Pathology Unit of the IRCCS-CROB.
Patient’s characteristics, including clinical data referring to
sex, age, tumor stage and grading, metastatic pattern and
medical therapies are reported in Table 1. All patients gave
their informed written consent to use biological specimens
for investigational procedures. Tumor stage was classified
according to TNM classification system [33].

Immunohistochemistry
Four-μm serial sections from formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded blocks were cut and mounted on polyL-lysine-coated glass slides. Immunohistochemical analysis
was performed using the Artisan Dako staining system
(Dako Italia srl, Milano, Italy) and streptavidin-biotin
horseradish peroxidase technique (LSAB-HRP), according
to the best protocol for the antibody previously tested in our
laboratory [14]. Mouse monoclonal anti-TRAP1 antibody
(sc-73604) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg,
Germany) was used from immunostaining. Sections
were counterstained with type-II-Gill’s haematoxylin,
dehydrated with ethanol and permanently coverslipped.
Results of the immunohistochemical staining were
evaluated separately by two observers particularly trained
for colorectal pathology and completely blind to the
histological diagnosis. The inter-rater reliability between
the two investigators examining the immunostained
sections was assessed by the Cohen’s K test, yielding K
values >0.70 in all instances. Immune-stained cells were
counted in at least 10 High Power Fields (HPF) analyzed
with an optical microscope (Olympus BX53; Olympus
Italia, Milan, Italy) at 40x magnification. TRAP1-positive
staining was defined as perinuclear (mitochondrial) staining
in tumor tissue. The number of TRAP1-expressing tumor
cells was estimated as a mean percentage of total number
of cells per section and grouped according to the percentage
of positive cells: 0 (no staining), 1 (1%-33%), 2 (34%-66%)
and 3 (67%-100%). The intensity of TRAP1 staining was
graded as 0 (no staining), 1 (weak/moderate), 2 (strong). A
combined numeric IHC score was calculated as the product
of staining intensity and percentage of stained cells [14].
TRAP1 staining was interpreted as positive in case of a
product > 1.

TCGA
Cohort_1
http://www.cbioportal.org/
study?id=coadread_tcga and Cohort_2 (Provisional) (level
3 data) were used to correlate TRAP1 mRNA expression
performed by total RNA sequencing and protein by mass
spectrometry with Copy Number Alterations data performed
by array methods and calculated with GISTIC statistics.
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare gene expression
between more than two groups (Deletion, Diploid and Gain/
Amplification). Post-hoc Dunn’s test was performed to
evaluate multiple comparison. The Sperman R (with 95%
confidence interval) was calculated to evaluate correlation
of gene expression with relative linear copy-number values.

Statistical analysis
The Sperman R (with 95% confidence interval)
was calculated to evaluate correlation between TRAP1
expression and its client proteins in the study cohort.
Unsupervised analysis of TRAP1 expression and its client
protein was performed to evaluate patients clustering
and grouping of signature. Heatmap and hierarchical
clusters were generated using dChip (DNA-Chip Analyzer
software), with inverse correlation as distance metric and
average linkage method.
Progression Free Survival (PFS) and OS curves
were estimated and plotted with the Kaplan-Meier method.
Hazard ratio (HR) and the corresponding two-sided 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated by Cox
proportional hazards models. Statistical significance
was defined as p <0.05. Analyses were performed using
package R version 3.2.3 (The R Project for Statistical
Computing). Continuous data were reported as means
and standard deviations or medians and range, meanwhile
categorical data were reported as counts and percentages.
