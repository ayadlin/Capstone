Abstract
Human CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL), in contrast with CD8+ blood cells, show impaired
IFN-γ secretion on ex vivo restimulation. We have attributed the impaired IFN-γ secretion to a decreased
mobility of T-cell receptors on trapping in a lattice of glycoproteins clustered by extracellular galectin-3.
Indeed, we have previously shown that treatment with N-acetyllactosamine, a galectin ligand, restored this
secretion. We strengthened this hypothesis here by showing that CD8+ TIL treated with an anti–galectin-3
antibody had an increased IFN-γ secretion. Moreover, we found that GCS-100, a polysaccharide in clinical
development, detached galectin-3 from TIL and boosted cytotoxicity and secretion of different cytokines.
Importantly, we observed that not only CD8+ TIL but also CD4+ TIL treated with GCS-100 secreted more
IFN-γ on ex vivo restimulation. In tumor-bearing mice vaccinated with a tumor antigen, injections of
GCS-100 led to tumor rejection in half of the mice, whereas all control mice died. In nonvaccinated mice,
GCS-100 had no effect by itself. These results suggest that a combination of galectin-3 ligands and therapeutic
vaccination may induce more tumor regressions in cancer patients than vaccination alone. Cancer Res; 70(19);

Introduction
Most cancer patients mount a spontaneous T-cell response against their tumor, and antitumor T cells can accumulate at metastatic sites (1–4). In several tumor types,
the presence of T-cell infiltrates, which may contain tumorspecific lymphocytes, seems to correlate with better prognosis (5–7). In patients with advanced cancer, tumors
progress despite the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphoAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and

cytes (TIL). This suggests that the antitumoral T cells become ineffective either because tumor cells have become
resistant to the immune attack or because TILs have become
functionally impaired (8, 9).
Despite this potentially adverse tumoral environment,
human TIL can easily be expanded in vitro and the resulting
T-cell lines and clones can lyse autologous tumor cells
(10, 11). However, reports on the ex vivo function of human
TIL are scarce. CD8+ T lymphocytes isolated from renal cell
carcinomas displayed no cytotoxicity in a redirected killing
assay, in contrast with blood CD8+ T cells of healthy donors
(12). CD8+ T cells, which were isolated from a metastatic
lymph node of a melanoma patient and recognized the modified Melan-AMART-1 peptide, failed to produce IFN-γ on
short-term restimulation with peptide, as opposed to anticytomegalovirus CD8+ T cells from the same tumors (13).
TILs were also shown to differ from blood T cells for gene
expression patterns and for several markers such as granzyme B and perforin, suggesting an impaired function
(5, 14–17).
We previously described a physical dissociation of T-cell
receptors (TCR) from coreceptors CD8 on human TIL and
CTL clones with impaired function (18). A galectin ligand,
N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc), restored the ability of nonfunctional T cells to secrete cytokines, and this increased
secretion was associated with an increased proximity of surface TCRs with the coreceptor CD8. We therefore attributed
the TCR-CD8 dissociation observed on nonfunctional CTL

clones to a reduced mobility of the TCRs, which are trapped in
a lattice of glycoproteins clustered by extracellular galectin-3,
a lectin abundantly secreted by macrophages and various
types of tumor cells (19, 20). Our data suggested that intratumoral galectin-3 could impair T-cell function and that
galectin-3 ligands could improve antitumor immunity in vivo.
Several galectin ligands, in particular galectin-3 ligands,
have been identified in the past decade, such as polysaccharides extracted from plants or fungi (e.g., ref. 21; a complete
list of references is available as Supplementary Data). Synthetic galectin-3 ligands were obtained by decorating lactose
and galactose cores with various moieties or by creating
branched structures such as glycodendrimers (reviewed in
refs. 22, 23). A few of them were reported to reduce the number of tumor metastases in mice (24–29). Only GCS-100, a
modified citrus pectin, and DAVANAT, a galactomannan
extracted from guar beans, have previously been used in clinical trials (30–32).
We here compared the effect of GCS-100 with that of
LacNAc on the cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion by CD8+
and CD4+ human TIL on ex vivo stimulation, and tested the
therapeutic potential of GCS-100 in a murine tumor model.

Materials and Methods
Cells, TILs, and reagents
Patient-derived solid tumor samples, tumor ascites, and
blood cells were collected after approval by institutional
review boards of all collaborating institutions. Cells from
ascites were concentrated by centrifugation and either frozen
at −80°C or resuspended in culture medium made of Iscove's
modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.24 mmol/L of L -asparagine, 0.55 mmol/L of
L-arginine, 1.5 mmol/L of L-glutamine (AAG), 100 μg/mL of
streptomycin, 100 units/mL of penicillin, 30 μg/mL of gentamicin (culture medium; Sigma-Aldrich), and 2% human
serum (HS) or ascitic fluid (ascites without cells). Ascitic fluid
was frozen at −20°C. Solid tumors were mechanically dissociated and either passed through a 0.1-mm sieve before cryopreservation in 10% DMSO/3.6% HS or incubated for 2 to
3 hours in culture medium supplemented with 0.14 units/mL
Liberase Blendzymes (Roche). Mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood of hemochromatosis patients, ascites,
or solid tumor samples using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield
PoCAS) and usually frozen at −80°C or −196°C. Cells were
thawed in culture medium supplemented with 2% to 10%
HS, 6 IU/mL of interleukin (IL)-2, and 5 units/mL of DNase
I (Sigma-Aldrich). T cells were isolated from mononuclear
cells by rosetting with sheep erythrocytes (BioMérieux) previously treated with 2(2-aminoethyl) isothiourea dihydrobromide (Sigma-Aldrich). CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were isolated
by a positive selection strategy (AutoMACS System, Miltenyi
Biotec) using magnetic beads coated with anti-CD8. For
samples LB2990, LB2974, and LB2912 in Fig. 1A, all the samples in Fig. 1B, sample LB2974 in Fig. 1C, and sample LB2991
in Fig. 2, a depletion strategy using the CD8 untouched isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) was used. The purity of the CD4+
or CD8+ T-cell samples was between 90% and 95%. Human

recombinant IL-2 was from Chiron Healthcare SAS, IL-7 was
from R&D Systems, LacNAc was from Carbosynth, and
unmodified citrus pectin was from Sigma. GCS-100 was provided by Prospect Therapeutics, Inc. (now Solana Therapeutics). All the cell lines were obtained several years ago in our
laboratory and described previously, but the cell lines were
not authenticated according to guidelines described in
http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/site/misc/ifora.xhtml.
Functional assays
Polyclonal stimulations were performed in roundbottomed microwells with 10,000 T cells in 200 μL of culture
medium, containing 0–6 IU/mL of IL-2, with 3,000 (ELISA
and Bioplex) or 10,000 (ELISpot) beads coated with antiCD3/CD28 antibodies (Dynabeads, Invitrogen). IFN-γ secreted after overnight coculture was measured by ELISA using
Biosource Cytoset reagents (Invitrogen) or by ELISpot (ELISpot PLUS kit ALP; Mabtech) using the AID-ELISpot classic
reader software 5.0 (Autoimmun Diagnostika). In the cytotoxicity assay, the target cells were murine P1.azar cells derived from mastocytoma cell line P815 (33). Target cells
were labeled for 1 hour with 50 μCi of Na[51Cr]O4, washed,
and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3, 1 μg/mL; Mabtech). CD8
+
T cells were added to the targets, and chromium release was
measured after 4 hours of incubation. For the degranulation
assay, CD8+ T cells (75,000) were stimulated for 5 hours in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium 2% HS AAG with 150,000
mouse cells (P815) incubated with anti-CD3 antibody or
75,000 CD3/CD28 beads. Brefeldin-A (GolgiPlug, Becton Dickinson) and FITC-coupled anti-CD107a and anti-CD107b
(1:100), or the control isotype (IgG1, Becton Dickinson), were
also added. After 5 hours of stimulation, cells were washed, labeled for 15 minutes at 4°C with peridinin chlorophyll protein
(PerCP)-coupled anti-CD3 (1:40, SK1; Becton Dickinson) and
allophycocyanin-coupled anti-CD8 (1:40, RPA-T8; Becton Dickinson) antibodies, washed, and fixed in PBS and 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur
(Becton Dickinson). The percentage of CD107+ cells was estimated for the CD3+CD8+ T cells.
Detachment of galectins
Cells from ascites were treated for 15 minutes at 4°C with
Fc blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec) before treatment with
anti–galectin-1 or anti–galectin-3 antibodies. Melanoma cell
line MZ2-MEL.43 and cells from ascites were incubated for
2 hours at 37°C under agitation with LacNAc (5 mmol/L),
GCS-100 (25 or 5 μg/mL), or B2C10 (mouse IgG1; Becton
Dickinson); fixed for 5 minutes at room temperature in
PBS with 0.5 mg/mL dithio-bis-succinimidyl propionate
(Thermo Scientific); washed; incubated for 20 minutes at
room temperature with 25 mmol/L of glycine; washed again;
and incubated with 5 μg/mL of either anti–galectin-3
antibody M3/38 (rat IgG2a; BioLegend) or polyclonal anti–
galectin-1 rabbit IgG (Abcam). Cells were further incubated
at 4°C for 15 minutes, washed, and incubated for 15 minutes
at 4°C with relevant anti-immunoglobulin secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen), together

final washing step, cells were fixed with 2% PFA in PBS

weight of 120 kDa (average) to GCS-100, according to the
molecular weight described for another modified pectin by
Miller and colleagues (34).

The following antibodies were used: anti-TCRβ (1:40, IP-26,

Mice vaccination and GCS-100
P815 clone 3 cells were expanded in DMEM supplemented with AAG, 10% FCS, glucose, and 75 μmol/L of mercaptoethanol (33). The recombinant adenovirus construct
contains the coding sequence of a fusion protein combining
the first 81 amino acids of the mouse invariant chain with
the first 83 amino acids of P1A, a protein containing an
antigenic peptide, which is a tumor rejection antigen of
P815 (35).

Results
GCS-100 boosts IFN-γ secretion by CD8+ and CD4+ TILs
CD8+ TILs were isolated to >90% purity from 18 tumors: 5
solid melanomas and 1 melanoma ascites, 1 breast carcinoma pleural effusion, and 11 carcinoma ascites from different histologic origins. The lymphocytes were incubated with
GCS-100 or LacNAc for 2 to 20 hours and then stimulated
overnight by the addition of beads coated with anti-CD3
and anti-CD28 antibodies (CD3/CD28 beads). IFN-γ secretion by nontreated TIL isolated from four of five solid tumors
was undetectable, whereas secretion by nontreated TIL
isolated from ascites was more variable. The presence of
GCS-100 boosted IFN-γ secretion by >3-fold in 13 of 18 cultures, and the average increase in IFN-γ secretion for all
cultures was 4-fold (Fig. 1A). Treatment with LacNAc instead
of GCS-100 had a similar effect (Fig. 1A). When the same
GCS-100 or LacNAc treatment was applied to blood CD8+
T cells isolated from patients with hemochromatosis, the
increase in IFN-γ secretion was marginal (Fig. 1B). We concluded that CD8+ TILs, compared with normal blood CD8+
T cells, are often impaired in their ability to secrete IFN-γ
on stimulation. However, this defect can be reverted, at least
in part, with the addition of GCS-100 or LacNAc.
In our previous report (18), CD4+ TILs were not analyzed.
CD4+ TILs were therefore isolated from 13 of the 18 TIL
samples shown in Fig. 1. They were also incubated with
GCS-100 or LacNAc and then stimulated by the addition of
CD3/CD28 beads. In the presence of GCS-100, IFN-γ secretion was increased by >3-fold in 6 of 13 samples (Fig. 1C).
We conclude that the impaired secretion of IFN-γ can be

corrected by GCS-100 and LacNAc not only for CD8+ TIL
but also for CD4+ TIL.
To estimate the number of IFN-γ–secreting T cells, we
performed ELISpot experiments with a few TIL and blood
samples. Isolated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were incubated
overnight with GCS-100 or LacNAc and then stimulated by
the addition of CD3/CD28 beads. After sugar treatment, the
number of IFN-γ–secreting cells increased by a factor of 2 for
the TIL, whereas the sugar treatment had a marginal effect
on the blood CD8 T cells (Fig. 1D).
To increase TIL function in patients, GCS-100 has to be
effective in a tumor environment, despite the presence of
suppressive factors found in ascitic fluid and cells that could
inhibit TIL, such as tumor cells or regulatory T cells. To mimic these situations, two types of experiments were conducted.
First, nine CD8+ TIL populations were incubated with galectin ligands as above and stimulated in medium supplemented with 20% to 25% of cell-free carcinomatous ascitic fluid.
IFN-γ secretion increased >3-fold in five of nine samples
(Fig. 2A). Second, the effect of LacNAc and GCS-100 was
tested on either CD2+ cells (including natural killer cells,
CD8+, and CD4+ T cells) or on the total cell population,
further containing macrophages and tumor cells. The cells
were resuspended either in culture medium or in ascitic
fluid. CD8 + TILs were purified after a first GCS-100 or
LacNAc treatment and then stimulated with CD3/CD28
beads in the presence of LacNAc or GCS-100 (Fig. 2B).
The results suggest that both LacNAc and GCS-100 can boost
IFN-γ secretion by CD8+ TIL even in the presence of either
carcinomatous ascitic fluid or other cells present in ascites
(Fig. 2B).
GCS-100 boosts other functions of CD8+ and CD4+ TILs
In addition to IFN-γ secretion, several other TIL functions
were also tested (i.e., secretion of other cytokines, cytotoxicity, and degranulation). In comparison with untreated cells,
GCS-100– and LacNAc-treated cells also secreted more IL-2
and tumor necrosis factor-α, but no IL-4 (Supplementary
Table S1). With some TIL samples, we observed slightly more
secretion of IL-10 and IL-17 after treatment. Cytokine secretion was similar for treated and untreated blood CD8+
T cells.
We estimated the cytotoxicity of CD8+ TIL using mouse
target cells coated with an anti-CD3 antibody (Fig. 3A).
Only the CD8+ TIL treated with GCS-100 had a significant
cytotoxicity, whereas the cytotoxicity of untreated CD8+
TIL was minimal. The cytotoxicity of CD8 + peripheral
blood lymphocytes (PBL) was higher than that of TIL,
but similar for treated and untreated cells. We also measured degranulation, a prerequisite for cytolysis. The percentages of degranulating cells were identified by surface
expression of CD107a and CD107b, which reside in cytolytic granule membranes within the cytoplasm and are mobilized to the cell surface following activation-induced
granule exocytosis (Fig. 3B). The percentage of CD107+
cells was much higher in treated TIL compared with untreated TIL, whereas this percentage was equivalent for
treated and untreated blood CD8 + cells. Finally, we

measured the intracellular content of perforin and granzyme B as phenotypic markers of cells that might have
a potential to kill. Both treated and untreated TILs have
a similar content of the two enzymes, indicating that the
boosting effect of GCS-100 and LacNAc treatment was not
due to an effect on perforin or granzyme content (Supplementary Fig. S1).

The toxicity of GCS-100 was evaluated with human melanoma cells and T-cell clones. Their proliferation was measured
for at least 4 weeks in the presence of various concentrations
of GCS-100. Growth inhibition was observed starting at day 7
at a concentration of 125 μg/mL (Supplementary Fig. S2). At
5 μg/mL, which was efficient in augmenting cytokine secretion
by TIL, GCS-100 had no effect on proliferation.

An anti–galectin-3 antibody promotes IFN-γ secretion
by stimulated CD8+ TILs
Our working hypothesis for impaired IFN-γ secretion by
CD8+ TIL on ex vivo stimulation is that galectin-3, which
can be secreted by tumor cells and macrophages, binds to
glycoproteins and oligomerizes on the T-cell surface, resulting in galectin–glycoprotein lattices that decrease TCR
mobility (36). This hypothesis was also based on the dissociation of TCR from CD8 coreceptors observed on nonfunctional CTL clones and the increased TCR/CD8 colocalization
after LacNAc treatment (18). However, because GCS-100 and
LacNAc could compete with several galectins, we tested the
effect of an anti–galectin-3 monoclonal antibody, B2C10,
which binds to the NH2-terminal domain of galectin-3 and
presumably affects the oligomerization of the lectin: blocking
this process should therefore decrease the T-cell inhibitory
activity of galectin-3 (37). CD8+ TILs were incubated and stimulated in the presence of either antibody B2C10, a control antibody as negative control, or GCS-100 as a positive control
(Fig. 4A). B2C10 boosted IFN-γ secretion to a comparable
extent as GCS-100.
Other galectins (i.e., galectin-1 and galectin-9) were detected in human and/or murine tumors and thought to play
a role in antitumor immunity (reviewed in ref. 19). We failed
to detect galectin-8, galectin-9, or MGL (a lectin implicated in
the regulation of T-cell function) on TIL (38). However, in
addition to galectin-3, we detected galectin-1 (Fig. 5). We
compared GCS-100 and LacNAc for their ability to detach
galectin-3 and galectin-1 from melanoma cells that carry
both galectins (Supplementary Fig. S3). The concentrations
of GCS-100 that were able to detach 50% (EC50) of the surface galectin-3 and galectin-1 were estimated at 1.3 μmol/L
(159 μg/mL) and 2 μmol/L, respectively. EC50s were estimated for LacNAc at 9 and 18 μmol/L, respectively. Different
modified citrus pectins and synthetic ligands were previously
shown to detach galectin-3 in a solid-phase assay with EC50
as low as 1 mmol/L (22, 39–42). The most effective synthetic
galectin-3 ligand seems to be a thiodigalactoside derivative
that has a Kd of 33 nmol/L (39).
Incubation of TIL for 2 hours with 5 mmol/L of LacNAc,
25 μg/mL of GCS-100, or 5 μg/mL of GCS-100 resulted in a
decrease of galectin-3 staining by 67%, 40%, and 24%, respectively (Fig. 5). Staining of galectin-1 did not decrease after
GCS-100 treatment, whereas it decreased by 38% after
LacNAc treatmen. Treatment with anti–galectin-3 antibody
B2C10 detached galectin-3 but not galectin-1 (Fig. 4B). We
failed to detach galectin-1 by treating TIL with three different
anti–galectin-1 antibodies, and these treatments did not
boost IFN-γ secretion either (data not shown). Because the
anti–galectin-3 antibody seemed unable to detach galectin-1
while boosting TIL function, we conclude that detaching
galectin-3 from TIL is sufficient to restore function while
not excluding the contribution of other galectins.
GCS-100 treatment promotes colocalization of TCR and
coreceptors CD8 or CD4

treated for 2 h with either 5 μg/mL of anti–galectin-3 antibody B2C10,
an isotype-matched control antibody, or 5 μg/mL of GCS-100. After
treatment, 10,000 cells were stimulated with CD3/CD28 beads as
described in Fig. 1. B, carcinoma ascites were treated for 2 h with B2C10
(5 μg/mL) before being labeled with anti-CD3 and anti-CD8 antibodies.
They were also labeled with anti–galectin-1, anti–galectin-3 (M3/38), or
isotype-matched control antibodies. Cells shown in the figures are
CD3+CD8+ cells. Data are representative of three experiments. After
B2C10 treatment, the decreased galectin-3 staining did not seem to be
due to competition between B2C10 and M3/38 antibodies because

Galectin-3 Ligand Corrects the Impaired Function of TIL

Figure 5. Galectin-3 can be detached from TIL with GCS-100. Carcinoma ascites from LB3081 were treated for 2 h at 37°C with GCS-100, LacNAc,
or medium and washed before being labeled with anti-CD3, anti-CD8, and anti–galectin-3 antibodies. Cells shown are CD3+CD8+ cells. Data are
representative of three experiments.

colocalization of TCR and CD8 at the surface of CD8+ TIL
compared with blood CD8+ T cells (18). We examined here
the effect of GCS-100 or LacNAc on this colocalization in
both CD8+ and CD4+ TIL using a microscopy-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer approach known as
“acceptor photobleaching.” TILs were treated for 2 hours
with GCS-100 or LacNAc, attached to coverslips, and labeled with an anti-TCRβ antibody coupled to an acceptor
fluorochrome and anti-CD8α or anti-CD4 antibodies coupled to a donor fluorochrome. Upon excitation at donor
wavelength, energy could be transferred from the donor
to the acceptor if closer than ∼10 nm. In these conditions,
full acceptor bleaching abrogates the energy loss, thus increasing donor emission. For each analyzed cell, three regions of the membrane were bleached and donor emission
increases were measured. Data are shown in Table 1 for
two CD8+ and two CD4+ TIL samples and for two cells
in each condition.
When CD8+ TILs were not treated with LacNAc or GCS100, no increase in donor emission was detected upon acceptor photobleaching, indicating poor TCR-CD8 colocalization (Table 1). For TIL VUB147, increases in donor
emission were 20% and 14% after incubation for 2 hours
with GCS-100 and LacNAc, respectively, thus indicating increased TCR-CD8 colocalization after treatment. Lower but
significant increases were observed with TIL LB3022. Although modest at first sight, these increases are well within
the reported range in the literature and similar to our
previously reported value (26%) with a functional CTL clone
(18, 43, 44).
For CD4+ TILs not treated with LacNAc or GCS-100, there
was also no increase in donor emission detected upon acceptor photobleaching (Table 1). After 2 hours of treatment
of TIL VUB129, increases were 11% with GCS-100 and 11%

with LacNAc. Comparable values were obtained with TIL
LB3022. For both CD4+ and CD8+ TILs treated with GCS100 or LacNAc, increased TCR/CD8 or TCR/CD4 colocalization was paralleled by increased secretion of IFN-γ upon
ex vivo restimulation (Table 1).
Vaccinated tumor-bearing mice that were also treated
with GCS-100 reject their tumors
We tested the therapeutic effect of GCS-100 in tumorbearing mice. Forty mice were injected s.c. in the flank with
2 × 106 P815 mastocytoma cells. On day 4, half of the animals
were vaccinated with an adenovirus encoding P815 tumor antigen P1A (Fig. 6A; ref. 35). On day 10, at which time all mice,
vaccinated or not, bore a tumor of ∼70 mm2, treatments
with either PBS or GCS-100 (200 μg s.c. close to the tumor
and 500 μg i.p.) were initiated. Mice were injected three times
a week. Three weeks later, the tumor had become undetectable in 6 of the 10 vaccinated mice treated with GCS-100, of
which 5 were still alive after another 3 months. Vaccine alone
had no effect on tumor growth, but slightly increased survival, with a median life span 10 days longer than in nonvaccinated mice. In nonvaccinated mice, GCS-100 had no
effect by itself, either on tumor size or on animal survival
(Fig. 6B and C).

Discussion
Our previous observations that human CD8 TIL increased
their secretion of IFN-γ after ex vivo treatment with
disaccharide LacNAc prompted us to test GCS-100, a polymeric galectin ligand approved for clinical trials. The results
reported here indicate that GCS-100 is as efficient as LacNAc
in boosting TIL to be cytotoxic and to secrete different cytokines, not only CD8+ but also CD4+ TIL. This effect was obtained

at concentrations (5 μg/mL) much lower than those used to
induce apoptosis of tumor cells (>100 μg/mL), the activity that
prompted its administration to cancer patients (30).
Why do galectin-3 ligands improve human TIL function?
Our working hypothesis is that TILs have been stimulated
by antigen recently and that activation could modify the
expression of enzymes of the N-glycosylation pathway and
change the structure of N-glycans exposed at the cell
surface, as shown for murine T cells (45). We surmise that
the recently activated TILs, compared with resting T cells,
harbor a set of glycans that are either more numerous or
better ligands for galectin-3. Galectin-3 is abundant in many
solid tumors and carcinomatous ascites and can form lattices

with surface glycoproteins that would thereby reduce TCR
mobility. This could explain the absence of colocalization of
TCR and CD4/CD8 coreceptors, the impaired function of TIL,
and the boosting effect of galectin ligands.
Several of our new results support this hypothesis. First,
treatment with an anti–galectin-3 antibody that was able to
detach galectin-3 from TIL is as efficient as GCS-100 in
increasing IFN-γ secretion by TIL. Second, both GCS-100
and LacNAc can detach galectin-3 from the surface of cells.
Third, treatment of TIL with GCS-100 or LacNAc increased
both IFN-γ secretion and colocalization of TCR with coreceptors CD8 or CD4. In this respect, the increased TCR-CD4 colocalization after GCS-100 or LacNAc treatment suggests a common

NOTE: CD8+ or CD4+ TILs were isolated from ascites of carcinoma patients, frozen, and thawed 2 h before the experiment. Cells
were subsequently incubated for 2 h at 37°C with medium containing 10% ascitic supernatant in the presence of 2 mmol/L LacNAc
or 5 μg/mL GCS-100. After washing, some cells were tested for IFN-γ secretion, and the others were attached to coverslips, labeled on ice with anti-TCR antibodies (acceptor) and anti-CD8 or anti-CD4 antibodies (donor), fixed, and stained with secondary
antibodies. For each of the two cells that were analyzed, in three regions of interest, five images were recorded before bleaching
and five others after bleaching of the acceptor fluorochrome. Three control regions were not bleached. Increase in donor emission
was calculated as follows: [1 − (donor intensity before bleaching/donor intensity after bleaching)] × 100. For CD8+ TIL, mean
increase in donor emission (in percentage) was −2.1 ± 1.6 for nontreated TIL, 14.5 ± 2.2 (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test) for
GCS-100–treated TIL, and 14.4 ± 1.5 (P < 0.001) for LacNAc-treated TIL. For CD4+ TIL, mean increase in donor emission was
0.1 ± 0.7 for nontreated TIL, 13.8 ± 2.6 (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test) for GCS-100–treated TIL, and 9.3 ± 1.3 (P < 0.001) for
LacNAc-treated TIL. Secretion of IFN-γ was analyzed as described in Fig. 1.

mechanism behind impaired function of both CD4+ and CD8+
TIL, at least for those cells responding to galectin ligands.
This hypothesis agrees well with data from two other
groups. Demetriou and colleagues observed that T cells from
mice deficient in N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase V, an enzyme of the N-glycosylation pathway, have a lower activation
threshold than T cells from wild-type mice. The authors were
the first to propose that reduced N-glycosylation, resulting in
looser glycoprotein/galectin lattices, could improve TCR clustering at the immune synapse (46). In addition, Kuball and
colleagues (47) observed an increased frequency of cells able
to secrete cytokines upon stimulation, if they were expressing
a transfected TCR lacking a glycosylation site. They proposed
therefore that N-glycosylation modifies TCR avidity.
Other galectins (i.e., galectin-1 and galectin-9) were detected
in human and/or murine tumors and thought to play a role
in antitumor immunity (reviewed in ref. 19). In humans, exposure to galectin-1 induced a shift from Th1 to Th2 cytokine response, promoted the expansion of CD4 +CD25high
FOXP3+ T cells, and increased the tolerogenic potential of
dendritic cells (41, 48–50). Galectin-1 was reported to induce
T lymphocyte apoptosis (48). In mice, tumor growth and
immune dysfunction correlated with the presence of galectin-1
(51). On the contrary, injections of galectin-9 were reported
to improve the survival of tumor-bearing mice (52). Here, we
show that, in addition to galectin-3, we also detected galectin1 on TIL. At the concentration used for treating TIL, LacNAc
but not GCS-100 was able to detach galectin-1 from treated
TIL. Because the anti–galectin-3 antibody did not detach
galectin-1 from TIL, we conclude that the mere detachment
of galectin-3 could result in a boosted secretion of IFN-γ by
stimulated TIL.
Impaired TIL function most probably results from a combination of mechanisms, all ultimately depending on tumor
cells. It is therefore remarkable that a few hours of treatment with GCS-100 or LacNAc was sufficient to strongly increase IFN-γ secretion by stimulated TIL. However, the
respective contribution of other galectins, transforming
growth factor-β, IL-10, PD-1/PD-L1, or regulatory T cells,
remains important to clarify in order to define whether different lymphocyte populations are impaired through different mechanisms and whether several inhibitory pathways
add up in the same cells.
The identification of antigens recognized by T lymphocytes on human tumor cells has resulted in numerous clinical
trials involving the vaccination of tumor-bearing patients
with defined tumor antigens. Among vaccinated metastatic
melanoma patients, ∼5% show a complete or partial clinical
response, whereas an additional 10% show some evidence of
tumor regression without clear clinical benefit. Analyses of
the T-cell responses of melanoma patients suggest the
following scenario (1, 53). Spontaneous tumor-specific T-cell
responses are frequent. Although they could control early
tumors, they eventually fail to do so and become impaired
in their function, most probably due to immunosuppressive
factors present in the tumor. Galectin-3 could be one of
them. Thus, the tumors of the patients about to receive
the vaccine already contain functionally impaired T cells di-

7486

Cancer Res; 70(19) October 1, 2010

rected against tumor antigens. It is therefore possible that, in
the few patients who show tumor regression following vaccination, some T cells generated by the vaccine reach the tumor
and succeed in reversing the local immunosuppression.
The relevance of combining vaccination and galectin
ligands is supported by the results obtained with GCS-100
in vaccinated mice bearing P815 tumors. Previous results
indicated that prophylactic vaccination with an adenovirus
encoding P815 tumor antigen P1A induced an anti-P1A T-cell
response that conferred protection against tumor challenge
in 57% of mice (54). However, therapeutic vaccination was
ineffective at inducing tumor rejection in tumor-bearing
mice.9 Injection in mice bearing a subcutaneous P815 tumor
of a Semliki Forest virus encoding P1A was therapeutic for
4 of 10 animals, provided that tumors were small (≤25 mm2)
and that intratumoral injections were used (55). In the present
report, injection of another P1A adenoviral construct conferred only a mild survival advantage. However, in combination with GCS-100 injections, half of the mice rejected their
tumor and appeared free of disease on day 130. The vaccination of tumor-bearing mice with P1A was essential for tumor
rejection, and we are tempted to believe that GCS-100 positively affected the anti-P1A T cells.
These experiments, however, do not provide any evidence
that GCS-100 exerts its therapeutic effects in mice by acting
on murine T cells or by disrupting galectin-glycan lattices.
Galectins were shown to play pleiotropic roles in tumor
metabolism. Myeloma cell growth was inhibited in vitro in
the presence of 500 μg/mL of GCS-100, which also triggered
apoptosis and decreased cell migration in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (30, 56). Modified citrus pectin inhibited the homoagglutination of melanoma cells,
adhesion of tumor cells to extracellular matrix and endothelial cells, as well as the formation of capillary tubes in the
presence of galectin-3 (reviewed in ref. 57). Although treatment of nonvaccinated, tumor-bearing mice with GCS-100
did not provide a survival benefit compared with control
mice, GCS-100 could have increased the apoptosis of tumor
cells and inhibited neoangiogenesis and metastasis formation and therefore participated in the therapeutic effect independently of an effect on the immune system.
It might seem risky to inject a galectin-3 ligand systemically, considering the pleiotropic role of galectin-3 (58, 59).
However, no life-threatening side effect was observed in a clinical trial with GCS-100. GCS-100 has been administered to cancer patients based on its potential to induce apoptosis of
myeloma cells in vitro (30). Twenty-four patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, who had relapsed after one or two therapies, received 160 mg/m2 of GCS-100 i.v. for 5 days every 21
days. Six of them experienced a partial clinical response. The
treatment was generally well tolerated with minimal hematologic toxicity. Skin rash was observed on two patients that
resolved with cessation of treatment or steroids.

Galectin-3 Ligand Corrects the Impaired Function of TIL

Taken together, our observations suggest that treatment
of cancer patients with galectin ligands could correct an
impaired function of TIL. As observed in mice, it is possible
that vaccination combined with local and/or systemic injection of a galectin ligand would be more effective at producing
tumor regressions than vaccination alone.
