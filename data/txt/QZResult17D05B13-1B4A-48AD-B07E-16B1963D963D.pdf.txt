Abstract
HHMI Author Manuscript
HHMI Author Manuscript

In most eukaryotes, the progressive loss of chromosome-terminal DNA sequences is counteracted
by the enzyme telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that uses part of an RNA subunit as template to
synthesize telomeric repeats. Many cancer cells express high telomerase activity and mutations in
telomerase subunits are associated with degenerative syndromes including dyskeratosis congenita
and aplastic anaemia. The therapeutic value of altering telomerase activity thus provides ample
impetus to study the biogenesis and regulation of this enzyme in human cells and model systems.
We have previously identified a precursor of the fission yeast telomerase RNA subunit (TER1)1
and have demonstrated that the mature 3′ end is generated by the spliceosome in a single cleavage
reaction akin to the first step of splicing2. Directly upstream and partially overlapping with the
spliceosomal cleavage site is a putative Sm protein binding site. Sm and Like-Sm (LSm) proteins
belong to an ancient family of RNA binding proteins represented in all three domains of life3.
Members of this family form ring complexes on specific sets of target RNAs and play critical
roles in their biogenesis, function and turnover. We now demonstrate that the canonical Sm ring
and the Lsm2-8 complex sequentially associate with fission yeast TER1. The Sm ring binds to the
TER1 precursor, stimulates spliceosomal cleavage and promotes the hypermethylation of the 5′
cap by Tgs1. Sm proteins are then replaced by the Lsm2-8 complex, which promotes the
association with the catalytic subunit and protects the mature 3′ end of TER1 from exonucleolytic
degradation. Our findings define the sequence of events that occur during telomerase biogenesis
and characterize roles for Sm and Lsm complexes as well as for the methylase Tgs1.

In eukaryotes, seven Sm proteins (SmB, SmD1, 2 and 3, SmE, SmF, and SmG) form a
heteroheptameric complex at U-rich Sm binding sites (AU4–6GR) of various small nuclear
RNAs (snRNAs) including the spliceosomal snRNAs U1, U2, U4 and U54,5. Assembly of
Sm proteins in vivo requires the help of SMN (Survival of Motor Neurons), mutations in
which result in spinal muscular atrophy6. At least two Sm-like complexes have been
characterized. The Lsm1-7 complex functions in mRNA degradation7,8 and the Lsm2-8
complex is involved in the maturation of various polymerase III transcripts9–11 and
ribosomal RNAs12. Purified Lsm2-8 binds to the 3′ terminal U-tract on U6, but not to the
internal U-rich Sm sites in U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs, illustrating that Sm and Lsm
complexes have different sets of target RNAs9.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Sm binding sites are also found near the 3′ ends of telomerase RNA subunits from diverse
yeasts1,13–16 and are important for RNA processing and/or stability1,2,15. Actual binding of
Sm proteins has been demonstrated for TLC1, the telomerase RNA from S. cerevisiae15, but
the functional consequences of this interaction have remained largely unexplored. The Sm
binding site in TLC1 is located several nucleotides upstream of the mature 3′ end13. In
contrast, spliceosomal cleavage of S. pombe TER1 truncates the putative Sm binding site by
one nucleotide2 which may compromise stable association of the Sm ring with mature
TER1. We therefore set out to examine which proteins bind to the 3′ end of mature TER1,
and to determine the function of the putative Sm site for TER1 biogenesis and stability.
A strategy was developed to examine the 3′ end of TER1 by massively parallel sequencing
to obtain a quantitative measure of 3′ end sequence distribution and to identify the most
abundant terminal sequences (Fig. 1a). This analysis revealed that following spliceosomal
cleavage over 60% of TER1 molecules have lost additional nucleotides at the 3′ end and
terminate in a stretch of 3 to 6 uridines (Fig. 1b). The 3′ end of the majority of TER1
therefore resembles the 3′ end of U6 snRNA, which is bound by the Lsm2-8 complex. To
test whether Sm or Lsm proteins associate with TER1, carboxyl-terminal c-Myc epitope tags
were inserted at the genomic loci of all Sm and Lsm proteins.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Immunoprecipitations were performed with a subset of strains that did not show overt
growth defects, expressed tagged proteins and maintained telomeres (Suppl. Fig. 1). The
snRNA U1 control specifically co-precipitated with Sm proteins confirming that the epitope
tags did not interfere with immunoprecipitation of RNP complexes (Fig. 1c). TER1 coimmunoprecipitated with all four Sm proteins tested (Fig. 1c, lanes 2–4 and Suppl. Fig. 2a),
including members of each of the three Sm subcomplexes4. Strikingly though, several-fold
more TER1 was recovered from Lsm IPs resulting in an ~80% depletion of TER1 from the
IP supernatant (Fig. 1c, lanes 5–7). TER1 precipitated with all subunits of the Lsm2-8
complex (Fig. 1c and Suppl. Fig. 2b), but not with Lsm1 (Fig. 1c, lane 8), the subunit
specific to the Lsm1-7 complex.
To determine whether Sm and/or Lsm are associated with active telomerase, direct in vitro
activity assays were performed on immunoprecipitates. Telomerase activity was detected in
all samples, but was 20-fold higher in Lsm3 and 4 compared to Smb1 and Sme1 IPs (Fig. 1d
and Suppl. Fig. 2c). In part this can be explained by the lower recovery of telomerase with
Sm proteins as judged by quantification of telomerase RNA on northern blots (Suppl. Fig.

2c, d). However, even after normalization to the amount of TER1 in each IP, Lsm-associated
telomerase activity was still 2.8-fold higher than the activity associated with Sm proteins.
The simplest explanation for this observation is that a fraction of Sm-associated TER1 is not
yet associated with the catalytic subunit of telomerase. Indeed, further experiments
confirmed that Sm binding precedes Trt1 binding to TER1.
To gain insights into the functions of Sm and Lsm binding to telomerase we initially focused
on the Sm association. For most characterized snRNAs, sequences downstream of the Sm
binding site are critical for Sm loading17. As the mature form of TER1 lacks such
sequences, we tested whether the Sm complex was loaded onto the TER1 precursor prior to
spliceosomal cleavage. RT-PCR confirmed that the precursor is indeed specifically
associated with the Sm complex, but is undetectable in Lsm immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2a).

HHMI Author Manuscript

As the spliceosome contains Sm complexes, the TER1-Sm interaction may reflect binding of
the spliceosome to the TER1 precursor. To test whether Sm proteins bind TER1 directly, we
generated constructs with either a mutant 5′ splice site or a deletion of the intron. Both
mutant RNAs co-immunoprecipitated with Smb1 (Fig. 2b). In contrast, replacing the Sm
binding sequence with a random sequence (ter1-sm6 mutant) reduced Sm association by 22fold (Fig. 2c). Similarly, Lsm association was undetectable for ter1-sm6 (Suppl. Fig. 3a).
We therefore surmised that Sm and Lsm proteins directly bind to the previously identified
site in TER1.
We next examined the effect of Sm binding on 3′ end processing by the spliceosome. Loss
of Sm binding in the ter1-sm6 mutant resulted in a 7-fold reduction in the processed form
(Fig. 2d). Furthermore, a series of deletion mutants within the Sm site caused progressive
inhibition of TER1 cleavage (Suppl. Fig. 3b), but not TER1 splicing (Suppl. Fig. 3c).
Finally, introducing an eight-nucleotide spacer between the Sm site and 5′ cleavage site also
impaired processing (Fig. 2e). In summary, weakening or abolishing Sm association with the
TER1 precursor reduces spliceosomal cleavage, indicating that Sm proteins promote 3′ end
processing of TER1.

A conserved feature among yeast and mammalian telomerase RNAs is the posttranscriptional hypermethylation of the 5′ cap into a 2,2,7-trimethyl guanosine (TMG)
form1,15,18. Sm proteins were first implicated in promoting cap hypermethylation on U2
snRNA in Xenopus extract19. It was later shown in vitro that TMG-capping of human U1
requires the presence of SmB/B′-SmD34,20. A screen for physical association with Sm
proteins led to the identification of Tgs1 in budding yeast21. To elucidate the roles of Sm
and/or Lsm in the hypermethylation of the 5′ cap on TER1, we tested which, if any, of these
proteins interact with S. pombe Tgs122 by two-hybrid. Smd proteins scored positive, with
Smd2 displaying the strongest interaction, and the other Sm proteins and all Lsm proteins
showing weak or no interaction (Suppl. Fig. 4a). We next examined whether preventing Sm
binding to TER1 affects cap hypermethylation. Whereas wild type TER1 was readily
precipitated with a monoclonal antibody against the TMG cap, ter1-sm6 recovery was at
least 25-fold reduced (Fig. 3a and Suppl. Fig. 4b). Only the cleaved form of TER1 was
recovered in TMG IPs from wild type cells, suggesting that spliceosomal cleavage precedes

hypermethylation (Suppl. Fig. 4c). TER1 was not TMG-capped in a tgs1Δ strain confirming
that Tgs1 is the enzyme responsible for TER1 cap hypermethylation (Suppl. Fig. 4d).

In light of the reported increase in telomerase RNA in tgs1Δ budding yeast 23, we were
surprised to observe a 5-fold reduction in TER1 RNA in tgs1Δ compared to wild type in S.
pombe (Fig. 3b). In addition, an increase in the precursor indicated a 3′ end processing
defect. The viability of tgs1Δ cells ruled out a major splicing defect, but we consistently
noted a small reduction in spliceosomal snRNAs isolated from tgs1Δ cells (Fig. 3b and data
not shown). To differentiate between a processing defect and a direct effect of the TMG cap
on TER1 stability, we mutated the spliceosomal cleavage site and inserted a hammerhead
ribozyme sequence to generate the mutant ter1-5′ssmut-HH (Suppl. Fig. 4e). In this
construct, processing of TER1 occurs independent of the spliceosome by ribozyme cleavage.
When comparing ter1-5′ssmut-HH levels between wild type and tgs1Δ cells, a 2-fold
reduction was observed (Fig. 3b). Taken together, these results show that tgs1Δ affects
TER1 processing by the spliceosome as well as TER1 stability. Consistent with the exquisite
dosage sensitivity for telomerase RNA in diverse species24,25, this reduction in TER1
resulted in shorter telomeres (Fig. 3c). Neither telomerase activity nor Lsm association was
reduced beyond the effects expected from the reduced steady-state level of TER1 (Suppl.
Fig. 4f, g).
The majority of TER1 post spliceosomal cleavage was bound by Lsm2-8, but a small
fraction was associated with Sm proteins (Fig. 1c). To investigate whether this was
indicative of a switch from Sm to Lsm binding, we examined the distribution of 3′ ends in
each IP by massively parallel sequencing. Around 70% of Sm-bound TER1 post-cleavage
terminated precisely at the spliceosomal cleavage site (Fig. 4a and Suppl. Fig. 5a).
Enrichment of this form in the Sm-bound fraction is consistent with Sm proteins binding the
TER1 precursor and remaining associated with TER1 until after cleavage and cap
hypermethylation have occurred. In contrast, Lsm-associated TER1 predominantly
terminated in U3–6 indicating that a switch between Sm and Lsm binding occurs after
spliceosomal cleavage and is associated with exonucleolytic processing (Fig. 4a and Suppl.
Fig. 5b). Consistent with the majority of telomerase activity being associated with Lsm2-8,
the TER1 3′ end distribution from Trt1 immunoprecipitates was indistinguishable from that
of Lsm-bound TER1.

HHMI Author Manuscript

The observation that loss of Sm binding coincided with the loss of terminal nucleotides led
us to speculate that Lsm2-8 may function in protecting the 3′ end of TER1 against further
exonucleolytic degradation. To test this hypothesis we attempted to generate Lsm deletion
strains. Whereas most Lsm proteins are essential, lsm1Δ and lsm3Δ cells were viable.
Consistent with a protective function for Lsm2-8, the levels of TER1 and U6 snRNA were
~5-fold reduced in lsm3Δ cells (Fig. 4b). No such effect was seen when deleting lsm1, nor
was the level of U1 snRNA reduced in lsm3Δ cells. The 3′ end sequence distribution for
TER1 from total RNA of lsm3Δ cells closely resembled the Sm-bound fraction in wild type,
whereas the Lsm-bound fraction was selectively lost in the mutant (Fig. 4c and Suppl. Fig.
5c). The viability of lsm3Δ cells further allowed us to confirm that cap hypermethylation is
unaffected by the absence of Lsm consistent with Tgs1 acting on TER1 prior to Lsm binding
(Suppl. Fig. 5d).

To independently verify a role for Lsm proteins in stabilizing TER1 we took advantage of
the observation that Lsm binding requires a stretch of consecutive uridines9. In contrast, Sm
binding tolerates other nucleotides in various positions of the binding motif, as exemplified
by the Sm binding site in human U1 snRNA (AAUUUGUG). When the TER1 Sm site was
mutated to reduce the number of consecutive uridines, the level of mature TER1 was
decreased (Fig. 5a). We next precipitated Smb1, Lsm4 and Trt1 from wild type and strains
containing the ter1-SmU1 mutant. As expected, the mutation had little effect on the binding
of Sm proteins (Fig. 5b). In fact, when normalized for the lower level of ter1-SmU1
compared to wild type, recovery of ter1-SmU1 with Smb1 was 1.6-fold increased. In
contrast, Lsm binding was diminished by more than 20-fold. Most surprisingly, the
interaction between the catalytic subunit Trt1 and telomerase RNA was also compromised in
the ter1-SmU1 mutant(Fig. 5b). The normalized recovery of ter1-SmU1 with Trt1 was 15fold lower than wild type, indicating that Lsm binding facilitates Trt1 - TER1 association,
possibly by inducing a conformational change in the RNA analogous to how binding of the
p65 protein facilitates telomerase assembly in Tetrahymena26–28. Consistent with the poor
recovery of ter1-SmU1 in Trt1 immunoprecipitations, in vitro telomerase activity was below
the level of detection (Fig. 5c).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Analysis of the 3′ end sequence distribution for ter1-SmU1 from total RNA revealed that
most of the mutant RNA ends at the cleavage site(Suppl. Fig. 6). This form constituted close
to 90% of ter1-SmU1 in Smb1 immunoprecipitates. In contrast, Lsm4 and Trt1 IPs
predominantly recovered RNA ending in –AUUU and –AUUUG (Suppl. Fig. 6). These
results further support that Trt1 preferentially associates with Lsm-bound telomerase RNA.
They also confirm the role of Lsm in protecting the 3′ end of TER1 from further degradation
as diminished Lsm binding coincides with an overall reduction in telomerase RNA and a
shift towards the form that is bound by Sm.
Taken together our observations demonstrate that distinct populations of TER1 molecules
associate with the Sm and Lsm complexes and suggest a sequence of events for TER1
biogenesis (Fig. 5d). The polyadenylated TER1 precursor is bound by the Sm complex
which promotes spliceosomal cleavage and subsequent 5′ cap hypermethylation by
recruiting Tgs1. The Sm ring is then replaced by the Lsm2-8 complex, which protects TER1
from exonucleolytic degradation and promotes binding of the catalytic subunit.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Despite their structural similarity and related binding motifs, Sm and Lsm complexes have
different modes of RNA binding and were thought to have distinct and non-overlapping sets
of target RNAs. The finding that the TER1 precursor is exclusively associated with the Sm
complex, whereas the majority of mature TER1 is bound by Lsm2-8 revealed that
biogenesis of telomerase RNA involves both Sm and Lsm complexes. Considering the
central roles that Sm and Lsm proteins play in RNA metabolism it will be important to
determine whether biogenesis of other non-coding RNAs also involves Sm and Lsm2-8
bound stages. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that several Sm/Lsm proteins have been
reported to co-purify with human telomerase (hTR)29,30 raising the possibility that they also
function in TMG cap formation and telomerase assembly.

Methods Summary

HHMI Author Manuscript

Myc epitope tags were integrated at the genomic loci and immunoprecipitations were
performed in whole cell extracts with anti-c-Myc antibodies. The different forms of
telomerase RNA were detected by northern blotting and RT-PCR. The distribution of 3′
ends was assessed at single nucleotide resolution by preparing libraries of oligo(A)-tailed
telomerase RNA and massively parallel sequencing.

Methods
Yeast strains and constructs
The genotypes of all strains used in this study are listed in table S1. Strains expressing cMyc-tagged Sm and Lsm proteins were constructed in strain PP138 as described31. Mutants
ter1-sm6, ter1-smΔG, ter1-smΔUG, ter1-smΔU2G, ter1-smΔU3G and ter1-5′ssmut-HH were
integrated at the ter1 genomic locus by gene replacement. Other ter1 mutants were
generated in the context of plasmid pJW10 using the QuikChange II XL site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and introduced into PP407, PP694 or PP695 as described1.

Yeast two-hybrid
Yeast two-hybrid was conducted using the Matchmaker GAL4 Two Hybrid System 3
(Clontech). Briefly, tgs1+ cDNA was cloned into the vector pGBKT7, and each full length
lsm and sm cDNA was cloned into pGADT7. Plasmids were co-transformed into the yeast
strain AH109 and positive transformants were selected on SD-Leu-Trp plates. Interactions
were analysed by plating 3-fold serial dilutions of overnight cultures onto SD-Leu-Trp-HisAde plates. Plates were incubated for three days at 30 °C.
Telomere length analysis and telomerase activity assay
Cells were propagated for at least 80 to 100 generations and telomere length was analysed
by Southern blotting as described32. Telomerase activity assays were performed on
sepharose beads as described1,33 following immunoprecipitation from cell extracts of strains
harbouring Myc-tagged Trt1, Sm or Lsm proteins.

Immunoprecipitation and RNA isolation
S. pombe cells were grown in YES (yeast extract supplements)32 and 6 litres of cell
suspension were harvested by centrifugation at a density of 5×106 cells ml−1. Cells were
washed in TMG(300) (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 10% (v/v)
glycerol, 300 mM sodium acetate), the pellet was resuspended in two packed cell volumes
of TMG(300) plus supplements (5 μg ml−1 chymostatin, 5 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 1 μg ml−1
pepstatin, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM PMSF) and the
suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed under liquid nitrogen in a 6850
cryogenic mill (SPEX CertiPrep) with eight 2 min cycles at an impactor rate of 10 per
second and a 2 min cooling time between cycles. The lysed cell powder was transferred into
a 50 ml tube and allowed to thaw on ice for 30 min. Cell extracts were cleared by two
rounds of centrifugation at 14,000g for 7 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80
°C. The concentration of proteins in the whole cell extract was measured by Bradford

protein assay. For c-Myc immunoprecipitation, monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (20 μg,
Sigma) was incubated with 150 μl protein A/G agarose slurry (Calbiochem) in phosphate
buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min. Beads were washed three times with
TMG(300) plus supplements and whole cell extract (1.2 ml) was added at a concentration of
5 mg ml−1 together with RNasin (40 U, Promega), Tween 20 (0.1%) and heparin (1mg
ml−1). For immunoprecipitation of TMG-capped RNAs anti-TMG antibody (3 μg,
Calbiochem) was bound to 50 μl proteinA/G agarose slurry (Calbiochem), washed with
TMG(300) and 150 μg total S. pombe RNA was added in 0.7 ml TMG(300). Samples were
incubated on a rotator at 4 °C for 4 hours and then washed three times with TMG(300) plus
supplements and 0.1% Tween 20 and once with TMG(50) (as TMG(300) but only 50 mM
sodium acetate). Protease inhibitors were omitted for TMG IPs. RNA was isolated by
treatment with proteinase K (2.0 mg ml−1 in 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 40 mM EDTA, 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5) at 50 °C for 15 min, followed by extraction with acidic phenol and ethanol
precipitation. RNA was then analysed by northern blotting, RT-PCR and 3′ end sequencing.
RNA analysis

HHMI Author Manuscript

RNA isolation and northern blotting were performed as described2 except that Biodyne
Nylon Transfer Membrane (Pall Corporation) was used and samples shown in Fig. 5a were
treated with RNaseH in the presence of oligo nucleotides BLoli1043
(AGGCAGAAGACTCACGTACACTGCAC), BLoli1275 and PBoli560
(GCGGAATTCT18)to obtain better separation of precursor and mature form. The TER1
probe was generated as described2; other RNAs were detected using 5′ 32P-labelled DNA
oligonucleotides as follows:
GCTGCAGAAACTCATGCCAGGTAAGT (snRNA U1),
CGCTATTGTATGGGGCCTTTAGATTCTTA (snoRNA snR101),
CTTCATCGATGCGAGAGCCAAGAGATCCGT( 5.8S rRNA), and
GCAGTGTCATCCTTGTGCAGGGGCCA (snRNA U6).

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously2 with primers BLoli1275
(CGGAAACGGAATTCAGCATGT) and BLoli1020 (CAAACAATAATGAACGTCCTG)
amplifying the intron-spanning region and PBoli918 (ACAACGGACGAGCTACACTC)
and BLoli1006 (CATTTAAGTGCTTGTCAGATCACAACG) amplifying a region in the
first exon. BLoli2051 (GACCTTAGCCAGTCCACAGTTA) and Bloli2101
(ACCTGGCATGAGTTTCTGC) were used to amplify snRNA U1. For quantitative realtime RT-PCR reverse transcription for input and immunoprecipitated RNA were performed
with antisense primer Bloli2860 (TGCTCAGACCAAGTGAAAAA) and Bloli2051. Realtime PCR was performed in triplicate 12.5 μl reactions using Power SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Bloli2860
and Bloli2859 (GGATCAAAGCTTTTGCTTGT) were used to amplify the first exon of
TER1. Bloli2051 and Bloli2101 were used to amplify snRNA U1. The qRT-PCR results
were imported into Excel and the average value and standard deviation of triplicate Ct
values were calculated. Enrichment of immunoprecipitation is represented by ΔCt (Ct value
(IP sample) minus Ct value (input)) relative to the untagged control samples. Error bars in
the graph represent the positive and negative range of the standard error of the mean.

DNase-treated total RNA samples (2.5 μg) or immunoprecipitated and purified RNA was
incubated with poly(A) polymerase (600 U, US Biologicals), RNase inhibitor (RNasin, 40
U) and ATP (0.5 mM) in 20 μl reactions at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction volume was
increased to 35.5 μl by the addition of the oligonucleotide Bloli2327
(CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA(T)18, 125 pmol) and dNTP mix (25 nmol), and
reactions were incubated at 65 °C for 3 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature.
The reaction volume was then adjusted to 50 μl with first strand buffer (Invitrogen),
dithiothreitol (5 mM), RNasin (40 U) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U,
Invitrogen), and reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 60 min. RNaseH (5 U, NEB) was
added and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 20 min. Aliquots (3 μl) of this reaction
were used in PCR with Taq polymerase (5 U, NEB) and primers
(GTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGATC##GCAAAATGTTAAAAGGAACG) and
Bloli2330 (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA) (200 nM each, ## represents a twonucleotide barcode used for multiplexing) under the following conditions: 3 min at 94°C
followed by 10 cycles of 30 sec at 94 °C, 45 sec at 55 °C and 60 sec at 72 °C, followed by 7
min at 72 °C. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit
(Qiagen) and eluted with 46 μl elution buffer. In the second round of PCR, 23 μl of the
eluted product was amplified with Bloli2329
(AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGA) and Bloli2330
(200 nM each) under the following conditions: 3 min at 94 °C followed by 29 cycles of 30 s
at 94 °C, 45 s at 55 °C and 60 s at 72 °C, followed by 7 min at 72 °C. PCR products were
separated by electrophoresis on 1.5 % agarose gels, and bands of the correct size were
excised and purified. The concentration of the PCR products was measured using the
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and further adjusted to 10 nM for
massively parallel sequencing using Illumina sequencing technology. Reads were analysed
using a custom script written in BioPerl to filter for those that contained the TER1 sequence
(GCAAAAN10AACG) and sort the reads into different bins based on the two-nucleotide
barcodes. The nucleotide sequence between GCAAAAN10AACG and the oligo(A) sequence
resulting from the poly(A) polymerase treatment represents the end of TER1 and was used
to determine the 3′ end sequence distribution at single nucleotide resolution. Further analysis
and graphs were prepared in Excel.

TER1 RNA associates with Sm and Lsm proteins. (a) Schematic of method used to map the
3′ end distribution of TER1 post spliceosomal cleavage. RNA is depicted in orange, DNA in
blue. Abbreviations: PAP, poly(A) polymerase; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase
chain reaction; bc, barcode. (b) Distribution of 3′ end positions in mature TER1 from wild
type cells. The average of four experiments is shown, error bars represent standard
deviation, a total of 23 × 106 sequences were scored. (c) Northern blot of RNA isolated from
immunoprecipitations with anti-c-Myc antibodies. Input and IP supernatant (s/n) represent
10% of the sample. An asterisk marks the position of the TER1 precursor. The lower band
corresponds to the mature form of TER1. (d) Telomerase activity assay performed on beads
following c-Myc immunoprecipitation of tagged proteins as indicated above each lane.
Activity was quantified relative to the Trt1 IP sample. A 32P-labelled 100mer
oligonucleotide was used as recovery and loading control (LC).

Sm proteins associate with TER1 precursor and promote spliceosomal cleavage. (a) RNA
from α-c-Myc IPs was analysed by RT-PCR using primers in the first and second exon
(primers represented by arrows in the schematic below the gel) to amplify the precursor
form (upper panel). The primer pair also amplifies the spliced form (lower band in Sm IPs).
A primer pair in the first exon was used to visualize all forms of TER1 combined (lower
panel). (b) Sm association does not require spliceosome assembly on TER1. RT-PCR was
performed on RNA purified from input (in) and α-c-Myc IP beads (IP). Primers that amplify
snRNA U1 were used as a positive control. (c) Schematic of the Sm binding site (upper
case) and 5′ splice site (5′ss, lower case) for wild type TER1 and the ter1-sm6 mutant.
Replacing the Sm binding site on TER1 (ter1-sm6 mutant) compromises Sm association.
RNA recovered from α-c-Myc IPs from untagged control and Smb1-myc strains was
quantified by real time PCR. Data is plotted as enrichment over the untagged control. The
error bars represent standard error of triplicate experiments. (d) Sm site mutation affects
TER1 spliceosomal cleavage. Total RNA samples were analysed by northern blot for TER1
and snRNA U1. (e) Increasing the distance between the Sm site and 5′ splice site in the ter1spacer mutant (AU6GgccauaugGU) impairs TER1 processing. Northern blot for TER1 and
snoRNA snR101 as loading control.

Tgs1 modifies TER1 and is required for normal telomere maintenance. (a) Loss of Sm site
compromises TMG cap formation. RT-PCR amplifying all forms of TER1 and ter1-sm6
from α-TMG IP samples, RT=reverse transcriptase, snRNA U1 served as control. (b)
Bypass of spliceosomal cleavage reveals functions of Tgs1 in TER1 processing and stability.
Northern blot analysis of TER1, snRNA U1, snR101 and 5.8s rRNA from total RNA
prepared from wild type and tgs1Δ strains harbouring either TER1 or the ter1-5′ssmut-HH
mutant. An asterisk marks the position of the TER1 precursor. (c) Deletion of tgs1+ causes
telomere shortening. Telomere length was analysed by Southern blotting of EcoRI-digested
genomic DNA from four independent tgs1Δ isolates and an otherwise isogenic tgs1+ strain.
A probe for the rad16 gene was used as a loading control (LC).

Lsm proteins replace Sm and protect the 3′ end of TER1. (a) 3′ end sequence distribution of
TER1 from IP samples. (b) Northern blot analysis from total RNA prepared from wild type,
lsm1Δ and lsm3Δ strains, quantified relative to wild type for each RNA. (c) Specific loss of
Lsm2-8 bound fraction of TER1 in lsm3Δ cells based on 3′ end sequence analysis from total
RNA samples. The wild type sample from Fig. 1b is included for comparison.

Lsm binding to TER1 promotes telomerase assembly and protects TER1 from degradation.
(a) Northern blot for TER1. The indicated ratios of mutant to wild type are normalized to the
loading control snR101 (LC). (b) Northern blot for TER1 and the ter1-SmU1 mutant using
RNA isolated from α-c-Myc IPs performed on extract from strains harbouring Smb1-myc,
Lsm4-myc or Trt1-myc as indicated. (c) Telomerase activity assay performed on Trt1
immunoprecipitates from strains harbouring either wild type or ter1-SmU1. An untagged
Trt1 strain was used as negative control. (d) Schematic of the sequence of events that occur
during telomerase biogenesis.
