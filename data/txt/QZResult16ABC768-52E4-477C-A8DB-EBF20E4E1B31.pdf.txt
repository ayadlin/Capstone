Abstract
There have been a number of clinical trials testing the efﬁcacy of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring a constitutively activating
mutation in FLT3. However, there has been limited efﬁcacy, most often because of inadequate achievement of
FLT3 inhibition through a variety of mechanisms. In a previous study, TTT-3002 was identiﬁed as a novel FLT3
inhibitor with the most potent activity to date against FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutations.
Here, the activity of TTT-3002 is demonstrated against a broad spectrum of FLT3-activating point mutations,
including the most frequently occurring D835 mutations. The compound is also active against a number of point
mutations selected for in FLT3/ITD alleles that confer resistance to other TKIs, including the F691L gatekeeper
mutation. TTT-3002 maintains activity against patients with relapsed AML samples that are resistant to sorafenib
and AC220. Studies utilizing human plasma samples from healthy donors and patients with AML indicate that
TTT-3002 is only moderately protein bound compared with several other TKIs currently in clinical trials. Tumor
burden of mice in a FLT3 TKI–resistant transplant model is signiﬁcantly improved by oral dosing of TTT-3002.
Therefore, TTT-3002 has demonstrated preclinical potential as a promising new FLT3 TKI that may overcome
some of the limitations of other TKIs in the treatment of FLT3-mutant AML. Cancer Res; 74(18); 5206–17. 2014

Introduction
FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine
kinase that is commonly mutated in acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). Approximately 23% of patients are found to harbor a
constitutively activating FLT3/ITD mutation that confers
poor prognosis (1). Kinase activating FLT3 point mutations
(FLT3/PM) such as those reported in the tyrosine kinase
domain are also frequently observed (7%–10% of patients;
ref. 2). Thus, mutant FLT3 is an attractive therapeutic target
in the treatment of this disease.
A number of clinical trials for patients with AML with FLT3
mutations have been performed using novel tyrosine kinase

inhibitors (TKI) that target FLT3 (3). However, there have been
limitations in the responses observed in patients on these
trials, often related to insufﬁcient achievement of thorough
FLT3 inhibition. An illustrative example is lestaurtinib (CEP701), an indolocarbazole that showed activity in phase I and II
trials, although only in those patients in which a high level of
inhibition of FLT3 signaling was achieved. It failed in a randomized phase III trial to improve remission and survival rates
for relapsed FLT3 mutant patients for those randomized to
chemotherapy plus CEP-701 versus those receiving chemotherapy alone in part because of failure to achieve inhibition in
a large enough fraction of patients (4, 5). A potential reason for
the failure of CEP-701 to effectively inhibit FLT3 signaling in
vivo was a high level of human plasma protein binding (6). This
shifts the IC50 against FLT3 from 2 to 3 nmol/L in assays
conducted in media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, typical
for most in vitro culture conditions) to 700 nmol/L in 100%
human plasma (reﬂective of in vivo binding in patients; ref. 7).
A number of FLT3 TKIs active against FLT3/ITD have little
activity against FLT3/PMs, such as the most frequently occurring D835Y mutation. Sorafenib is a biaryl urea compound that
targets multiple tyrosine kinases, including FLT3/ITD (8). The
results of clinical studies using sorafenib in combination with
chemotherapy are promising, demonstrating reduction in
bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) blasts as
well as increased CR rates in patients with FLT3/ITDþ AML (9–
11). Quizartinib (AC220) is another biaryl urea FLT3 inhibitor

TTT-3002 Overcomes FLT3 TKI Limitations

that has demonstrated signiﬁcant responses in patients with
FLT3/ITDþ AML in recent trials (12, 13). However, both
sorafenib and AC220 are inactive against many FLT3/PMs,
including the D835Y mutation, and thus do not beneﬁt patients
harboring this mutation (14–16).
Finally, treatment failure has also been observed because of
the selection for resistance-conferring point mutations that
have appeared in patients with FLT3/ITD-expressing AML
following TKI treatment. These mutations either occur in
residues within the ATP binding pocket or to residues
thought to affect protein structure in ways that also affect
the binding of the drug allosterically (3). Midostaurin
(PKC412) is a FLT3 TKI that demonstrated reduction of
blasts in a phase II trial of patients with relapsed or refractory
AML (17) and is moderately active against a number of known
FLT3/PMs (14). However, in a trial of patients with relapsed
or refractory AML, PKC412 selected for a mutation at residue
N676K in a FLT3/ITD patient that conferred drug resistance
(18). A number of initially responsive patients on AC220 and
sorafenib trials were also found to have selected for additional
resistance-conferring point mutations in the FLT3/ITD allele.
These frequently include a F691L mutation (analogous to the
T315I mutation in BCR/ABL that confers resistance to Gleevec) or D835 mutations (Y/F/V/H) in the kinase domain (19,
20). Crenolanib is a next generation FLT3 inhibitor that is
currently in phase II trials of relapsed AML with FLT3/D835activating mutations. This compound has demonstrated in
vitro and in vivo activity against FLT3/D835 mutations (Y/F/
V/H) and the dual FLT3-D835(Y/H)/ITD mutant receptors
(21, 22). However, it is unable to target the F691L mutation,
and therefore has the potential to select for this resistance
mutation in trials. Currently, the most potent activity against
the F691L mutation in vitro has been observed for the BCR–
ABL inhibitor ponatinib. However, ponatinib still shows a
nearly 20-fold shift in IC50 for the F691L mutation compared
with FLT3/ITD alone, and plasma samples from patients
show marginal levels of inhibition in the plasma inhibitory
activity (PIA) assay against the F691L mutation and no
activity against D835 mutations (23). Therefore, the search
for novel FLT3 TKIs that overcome some of the mechanisms
that result in persistent FLT3 activation is necessary to
improve the cure rate for this disease.
We sought to explore the ability of a novel FLT3 inhibitor,
TTT-3002, to overcome several mechanisms of drug resistance
associated with current FLT3 TKIs. We have previously
reported that TTT-3002 is the most potent FLT3 inhibitor
discovered to date, with picomolar IC50 values against FLT3/
ITD phosphorylation (24). Here we assess the activity of TTT3002 against a broad spectrum of known FLT3/PMs, as well as a
number of TKI resistance mutations within the FLT3/ITD allele.
Finally, the protein binding characteristics of TTT-3002 in
human plasma are explored to predict whether it is likely to
maintain activity against FLT3/ITD and FLT3/PM in patients.

Materials and Methods
Compounds
TTT-3002 was a generous gift of Hanno Roder from TauTaTis, Inc. CEP-701, AC220, sorafenib, and PKC412 were

www.aacrjournals.org

purchased from LC Laboratories. Compounds were dissolved
in 100% DMSO and prepared as 10 mmol/L stock solutions in
RPMI with 0.1% DMSO and stored at 80 C.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
Cells were cultured in the presence of inhibitor for 1 hour at
37 C, and FLT3 and phospho-FLT3 expression was analyzed by
performing immunoprecipitation of whole cell extracts for
FLT3 (S-18), followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as
described previously (24). Other proteins were detected from
whole cell lysates using the indicated antibodies and a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence.
Flow cytometry analysis
Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a BD FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences). The following anti-mouse
monoclonal antibodies and dyes were used for the staining of
cellular markers: CD135-PE, Annexin V-APC, 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD; BD Biosciences). For hematopoietic stem/progenitor staining, femur, tibia, hips, and spine were isolated
from Ba/F3-F691L/ITD Lucþ transplant recipient mice. BM
cells were isolated by crushing and stained with anti-mouse
CD135-PE (5 mL) for 40 minutes. Apoptosis was measured by
incubating treated cells with Annexin V-APC antibody and 7AAD for 10 minutes according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). All data were analyzed by FlowJo
analysis software (Tree Star).
Macromolecular modeling
To position TTT-3002, CEP-701, PKC412, AC220, and sorafenib on the FLT3 kinase structure (1RJB; ref. 25), the kinase
domains of the VEGFR2 kinase complexed with sorafenib
(4ASD; ref. 26) and the C-terminal Src kinase complexed with
staurosporine (1BYG; ref. 27) were superimposed on the FLT3
kinase structure. The program COOT (28) was used to generate
the N676K, F691L, and G697R substitutions by replacing the
native side chain with the most common rotamer of the
resistance variant.
Transplantation experiments
Transplantation of Ba/F3-F691L/ITD luciferase-expressing
cells was performed as described previously (24, 29). For
engraftment, 2  106 cells were injected by tail vein into female
BALB/C mice (day 0). Starting 7 days later, engraftment was
conﬁrmed by bioluminescence imaging of luciferase-expressing cells and mice were then treated with 6 mg/kg of TTT-3002
hydrochloride suspended by brief sonication 1 hour before
dosing in 1 mmol/L HCl twice daily or 10 mg/kg of sorafenib
suspended in 30% (w/v) Cremophor EL, 30% (w/v) PEG 400,
10% ethanol, and 10% glucose (all Sigma-Aldrich), as described
previously, once daily by oral gavage for 2 weeks (30). Mice were
imaged by injecting D-luciferin (3 mg intraperitoneally) and
visualized on an IVIS Spectrum imager (Caliper LifeSciences)
using Living Image software for analysis on day 7 post-inoculation in order to monitor engraftment. BM cells were harvested from the femur, tibia, and hips by crushing, and spleens
were harvested by mechanically ﬁltering through a 40-mm
nylon cell strainer (BD).

Results
TTT-3002 activity against FLT3-activating point
mutations
Many FLT3-activating point mutations have been observed
in patients with AML and the response of each FLT3/PM to
each FLT3 TKI varies widely (2, 3), (31–34). Notably, AC220 has
reduced potency against many FLT3/PMs, and is thus ineffective in treating patients with these mutations. To predict the
ability of TTT-3002 to inhibit FLT3/PM autophosphorylation,
we generated a panel of 12 stably transfected Ba/F3 cell lines in
which FLT3/PMs known to transform the cells to IL3 independence were introduced, and its activity was compared
directly to the cytotoxic activity of AC220 (Supplementary
Table S1). This panel included the most frequently occurring
D835 mutations (Y/F/V/H) and other D835 variants, as well as
I836 mutations and mutations in the juxtamembrane domain
(V579A and D593D). TTT-3002 is a potent inhibitor of all 12
mutants screened, with proliferation IC50 values in the low
nanomolar range, and is thus active against many FLT3/PMs
for which AC220 is completely ineffective (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1). Treatment with TTT-3002, but not
AC220, results in a marked induction of apoptosis of FLT3/
PM-expressing cells as determined by Annexin V binding,
reaching the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) by
10 to 50 nmol/L for all mutants. In contrast, activity against
FLT3/ITD-expressing cells is similar for the 2 compounds (Fig.
1B). TTT-3002 inhibits FLT3/PM phosphorylation in a dosedependent manner, achieving greater than 50% inhibition of
FLT3 signaling at a concentration of 0.5 nmol/L (Fig. 1C and D).
In contrast, AC220 failed to achieve thorough FLT3/PM inhibition even at 10 nmol/L concentrations (Fig. 1C). Therefore,
TTT-30020 s broad spectrum of activity against FLT3/PMs
increases its therapeutic potential in patients with this class
of non–ITD-activating FLT3 mutations.
TTT-3002 activity against FLT3 TKI resistance mutations
The phenomenon of drug resistance caused by selection
for FLT3 point mutations is occurring at increasing frequency as higher levels of inhibition by FLT3 TKIs are achieved in
clinical trials of patients with FLT3/ITD AML (19, 20, 35–37).

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

To test the ability of TTT-3002 to successfully treat some of
these resistance mutations, site-directed mutagenesis was
used to generate a series of FLT3/ITD TKI-resistant Ba/F3
cell lines (29, 38). The activity of TTT-3002 was then compared with that of a number of other FLT3 TKIs currently in
clinical trials. TTT-3002 is the most potent inhibitor against
the 6 FLT3/ITD TKI resistance mutants screened, with
proliferation IC50 values of approximately 1 nmol/L (with
the single exception of Ba/F3-G697R/ITD, IC50 ¼ 11 nmol/L;
Fig. 2A and Table 1). It effectively inhibits resistance mutations, against which other TKIs are ineffective. The activities
of CEP-701, sorafenib, AC220, and PKC412 against these
resistance mutants is similar to what has been reported
previously (21, 29). TTT-3002 inhibits FLT3 phosphorylation
in a dose-dependent manner in FLT3/ITD TKI resistant
cells, often with an IC50 of less than 250 to 500 pmol/L
(Figure 2B). The extent of inhibition is also signiﬁcantly
greater than the other TKIs at a ﬁxed concentration of 20
nmol/L, achieving 75% to 99% inhibition of FLT3 signaling
(Fig. 2C and D). TTT-3002 also inhibits phosphorylation of
downstream targets of FLT3 signaling, such as STAT5, AKT,
and MAPK (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore,
this compound's broad spectrum of activity against FLT3/
ITD TKI resistance mutations may enable it to successfully
treat patients with FLT3/ITD AML who have become resistant to other FLT3 TKIs.
Molecular modeling of the TKI-FLT3 binding interaction
To understand the patterns of drug resistance displayed by
different FLT3 TKIs in this study, the positions of staurosporine-like (TTT-3002, CEP-701, and PKC412) and sorafenib-like
inhibitors (sorafenib and AC220) bound to FLT3 were modeled
(Fig. 3). Although crystal structures of the FLT3 kinase bound
to these inhibitors have not been determined, crystal structures of the related VEGFR2 and C-terminal Src kinases bound
to sorafenib (PDB code 4ASD) and staurosporine (PDB code
1BYG), respectively, have been determined (25, 26). Assuming
that these drugs bind similarly to FLT3 kinase, we superimposed the kinase domains of the VEGFR2:sorafenib and
C-terminal Src kinase:staurosporine complexes on the FLT3
kinase structure to generate a model for how sorafenib and
staurosporine are likely to bind to FLT3. Inspecting these
models to investigate the likely effects of amino-acid substitutions in FLT3 known to confer resistance to TKIs in clinical
trials shows that substituting arginine for glycine at position
697 places side-chain atoms within 2.8 and 3.5 Å of atoms of
staurosporine-like and sorafenib-like inhibitors, respectively,
likely leading to steric clashes. Glycine 697 adopts main-chain
dihedral angles (phi of 60 , psi of 170 ) that are unfavorable
for non-glycine amino acids, and an arginine substitution at
this site would also lead to at least local changes in main-chain
conformation. It has been proposed that the F691 residue
forms a stabilizing p  p stacking interaction with AC220,
and thus a mutation to a Leu would result in reduced TKI
binding afﬁnity (20). TTT-3002 is predicted to bind FLT3
without making direct contact with the F691 residue, and thus
is unaffected by mutations at this site. Likewise, the closer
proximity of F691 and N676 to sorafenib compared with

staurosporine atoms likely underlies the trend for substitutions at these sites to confer resistance to sorafenib-like but not
staurosporine-like inhibitors.
TTT-3002 overcomes drug resistance in vivo
To assess the ability of TTT-3002 to overcome TKI resistance in vivo, a bioluminescent mouse model of leukemia
was utilized in which luciferase-expressing Ba/F3-F691L/
ITD cells (Ba/F3-F691L/ITD Lucþ) were transplanted into
syngeneic BALB/c recipients. The Ba/F3-F691L/ITD Lucþ
cell line is sensitive to TTT-3002 treatment in vitro with a
proliferation IC50 of <250 pmol/L for TTT-3002 versus >50
nmol/L for sorafenib (Fig. 4A). Engraftment was conﬁrmed
on day 7 by bioluminescence imaging of luciferase-expressing cells following tail vein injection of 2  106 cells in
recipient mice, which were then administered TTT-3002 and
sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose of 6 mg/kg twice a
day and 10 mg/kg every day, respectively, or vehicle control
(1 mmol/L HCl twice a day) for 14 days (n ¼ 4 per group; Fig.
4B; ref. 30). There was no signiﬁcant effect on hemoglobin or
platelet count with this drug administration schedule, with
counts in the normal range at the end of the treatment
period (11.0–15.1 g/dL and 592–2972 K/mL, respectively; Fig.
4C and D). Mice treated with vehicle or sorafenib succumbed
to disease at 21 days post-transplant with splenomegaly and
elevated CD135þ (FLT3) leukemic cells in the BM (Fig. 4E
and F). In contrast, spleen weights and the number of
leukemic cells (measured by their expression of CD135) in
the BM of TTT-3002 treated mice were signiﬁcantly reduced
(P < 0.01) and these mice seemed healthy at the time of
sacriﬁce (Fig. 4E and F). By comparison, both TTT-3002 (24)
and sorafenib are effective against Ba/F3-ITD Lucþ cells in
vivo under the same dosing schedule, indicating that the
presence of the F691L point mutation confers resistance to
sorafenib, but not TTT-3002.

To further provide proof-of-principle that TTT-3002 is active
against sorafenib-resistant cells in vivo, we utilized the Ba/F3F691L/ITD transplant model to simulate a clinical setting in
which a patient relapses while undergoing therapy with sorafenib with selection for a FLT3-F691L/ITD mutation and is
treated with TTT-3002 instead. Leukemic mice that received
sorafenib (10 mg/kg every day) for 2 weeks were administered a
single dose of sorafenib or TTT-3002 (6 mg/kg). Leukemic Ba/
F3-F691L/ITD cells from the enlarged spleens were harvested 2
hours later, and inhibition of pFLT3 was observed in vivo by
TTT-3002, but not sorafenib (Fig. 4G).
TTT-3002 activity against TKI-resistant relapsed AML
patient samples
Primary leukemic BM samples were obtained from patients
with FLT3/ITDþ AML who had initially responded to sorafenib
or AC220 on clinical trials but then had developed resistance.
They had relapsed with a dual D835/ITD mutation or D835
point mutation alone while on a FLT3 TKI (relapse AML1–3;
Supplementary Table S2). Leukemic blasts from these patients
were evaluated for their in vitro sensitivity to TTT-3002,
sorafenib, and AC220, along with a BM sample from a newly
diagnosed FLT3/ITD AML patient sample (AML1) for comparison. Signiﬁcant effects on proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and cell signaling were observed when each of these
samples was treated with TTT-3002 (Fig. 5A-C and Supplementary Table S2). The signaling changes were especially
prominent in pFLT3 (85%–99% inhibition) and pSTAT5
(71%–99% inhibition), with variable effects against pAKT
(80%–86% inhibition in 2/4 samples) and pMAPK (66%–73%
inhibition in 2/4 samples), dependent on their level and
alternative sources of activation. The proliferation IC50 for
TTT-3002 was 3 to 8 nmol/L for relapsed AML samples, and the
diagnostic sample (AML1) had an IC50 of 19 nmol/L. The IC50
for AC220 against relapsed AML samples, however, ranged

from 19 nmol/L to greater than 50 nmol/L, compared with
its low nanomolar IC50 against blasts from the newly diagnosed
FLT3/ITD patient (AML1). AC220 was moderately active
against blasts from AML1 and one relapsed patient sample
with a D835/ITD mutation (relapse AML1) with regard to
apoptosis, and was also able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation
in AML1 and relapse AML3. Sorafenib was active against only
AML1 cells and none of the three relapse samples, with
proliferation IC50 values greater than 50 nmol/L, the highest
concentration tested. Therefore, TTT-3002 maintains activity
against patient with human AML samples that have been
selected for resistance to the TKIs sorafenib and AC220 in
clinical trials.
Plasma protein binding properties of TTT-3002
Only free, non-protein bound levels of TKI are available to
bind to target and inhibit its kinase activity. To predict the
impact of human plasma protein binding on TTT-3002 efﬁcacy
in patients, we utilized the PIA assay, which we developed
previously to determine the extent of FLT3 inhibition being
achieved in clinical trials of multiple FLT3 TKIs (7). The PIA
assay is a valuable tool because human plasma contains the

entire array of proteins capable of binding to, and thus interfering with, a TKI's activity. Utilizing Ba/F3-ITD cells, we
compared the IC50 of TTT-3002 with regard to inhibiting FLT3
phosphorylation (1-hour treatment) in media supplemented
with 10% FBS (standard culture conditions) to that achieved in
100% mouse or 100% human plasma from healthy donors. We
found a 4-fold and 14-fold shift in IC50 values, respectively, in
mouse and human plasma (Fig. 6A and B and Supplementary
Table S3). This shift corresponds to approximately 75% and
93% protein binding, which is signiﬁcantly lower than the
binding observed for many other TKIs (7, 39). For example,
although the CEP-701 IC50 for FLT3 inhibition only shifts 6-fold
from RPMI with 10% FBS to 100% mouse plasma, the IC50
shifts greater than 100-fold in 100% human plasma (from 2 to
3 nmol/L to an IC50 of 700 nmol/L), which indicates plasma
protein binding of >99% (7). This was the major reason for the
failure of CEP-701 to show improved CR and survival rates in a
phase III clinical trial (5).
To explore the disparate plasma protein binding of TTT3002 and CEP-701, the impact of the two major human plasma
proteins known to bind many TKIs, a-1-acid glycoprotein
(AGP), and human serum albumin (HSA) was evaluated. AGP

is an acute phase plasma protein that is often elevated as much
as 4- to 5-fold in leukemia patients (5). To ascertain whether
TTT-3002 is signiﬁcantly bound by this protein, we treated Ba/
F3-ITD cells with TTT-3002 or CEP-701 at IC95 concentrations
ascertained under typical culture conditions (5 and 20 nmol/L,
respectively) in media supplemented with 0 to 2 mg/mL AGP
and measured the percentage of phospho-FLT3 inhibition
by Western blotting. Although CEP-701 almost completely
loses TKI activity with the addition of just 0.1 mg/mL AGP,
the lowest concentration tested, TTT-3002 was still strongly
active at physiological AGP concentrations, achieving greater
than 60% FLT3 inhibition at 2 mg/mL AGP (Fig. 6C). The
other major plasma protein capable of binding many drugs

is HSA. TTT-3002 and CEP-701 activities were not as greatly
affected by physiological levels of HSA, the most abundant
plasma protein (Supplementary Fig. 2A; ref. 40). Thus, TTT3002 should require lower doses than CEP-701 to achieve sufﬁcient concentrations of free drug in plasma because of lower
protein binding to AGP.
TTT-3002 activity in human leukemia patient plasma
To further assess the likely activity of TTT-3002 in a clinical
setting, human plasma samples were obtained from a panel of
patients with adult and pediatric AML at the time of diagnosis,
when AGP levels are known to often be elevated. Ba/F3-ITD
cells were then cultured in these plasma samples with the

AGP and HSA concentration ranges measured in the plasma
samples (0.5–2 mg/mL AGP, 2.5–4.0 g/dL HSA; Supplementary
Fig. S2B and S2C).

Discussion
TTT-3002 has been identiﬁed as a novel, potent small
molecule inhibitor of mutant FLT3 phosphorylation (24).
There are a number of mechanisms by which patients can
develop resistance to FLT3 inhibition by current TKIs. One
such clinical observation is the emergence of resistance mutations in FLT3/ITD-expressing cells, which render the cells
insensitive to TKI treatment. Other studies indicate that

10% of adult AML cases, provide a survival and proliferative
advantage to cells, and respond to many FLT3 TKIs differently
than do FLT3/ITD mutants. In this study, the potent in vitro
activity of TTT-3002 against a broad spectrum of FLT3/PMactivating mutations, as well as a variety of TKI resistance
mutations in the FLT3/ITD sequence was demonstrated. TTT3002 reduced cell viability and inhibited FLT3 autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner at low nanomolar to
picomolar concentrations. Although only the D835Y variant
in the FLT3/ITD allele was tested, inhibition of FLT3/D835F,
D835V, D835H, and other activating FLT3 point mutations was
also demonstrated. This implies that TTT-3002 would also
likely target these D835 TKI-resistant variants in a FLT3/ITD
allele.

selection for TKI resistance mutations in FLT3/ITD, is the
extensive protein binding for many TKIs that occurs in human
plasma. In the case of CEP-701, the compound is >99.9%
protein bound in plasma. Similar binding properties have also
been reported for PKC412 (>99%), sorafenib (99.7%), and
AC220 (99%; refs. 7, 39, and 41). This large amount of protein
binding limits the amount of free drug available to inhibit
target, reducing the efﬁcacy of some of these TKIs in clinical
trials. TTT-3002 shows more moderate protein binding in
human plasma (93%). This predicts that the shift in the
dose–response curve for TTT-3002 going from cell culture
conditions with 10% FBS to human patients should not be as
extreme as it is for some other TKIs. Thus, achieving a total
level of 30 nmol/L should achieve >90% FLT3 inhibition,
given the average IC90 of 2 nmol/L against FLT3/ITD phosphorylation by Western blotting. These are the approximate

drug and thus would help to determine dose and frequency of
administration in a future clinical trial.
The extensive preclinical studies highlighted both here and
in a previous manuscript (24) support the advancement of
TTT-3002 toward human clinical trials. Further studies will be
required to assess the safety and toxicity in nonrodent animal
models before moving this compound into human clinical
trials, where assessment of absorption, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics can be determined.
Drug dosing schedule and tolerance in humans will also need
to be determined in phase I trials before moving to trials in
patients with relapsed/refractory/resistant FLT3 mutant AML.
