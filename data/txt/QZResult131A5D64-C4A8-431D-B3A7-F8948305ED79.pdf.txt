Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Despite significant progress in the treatment of breast cancer particularly through the use of
targeted therapy, relapse and chemo-resistance remain a major hindrance to the fight to minimize
the burden of the disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that a rare subpopulation of cells
known as cancer stem cells (CSC), able to be generated through epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and capable of tumor initiation and self-renewal, contributes to treatment
resistance and metastases. This means that a more effective therapy should target both the
chemoresistant CSCs and the proliferating epithelial cells that give rise to them in order to reverse
EMT and attenuate their conversion to CSCs. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of AXL in
acting upstream to induce EMT in normal and immortalized human mammary epithelial cells in
an apparent positive feedback loop mechanism and regulate breast CSC (BCSC) self-renewal and
chemoresistance. Downregulation of AXL using MP470 (amuvatinib) reversed EMT in
mesenchymal normal human mammary epithelial cells and murine BCSCs attenuating selfrenewal and restored chemosensitivity of the BCSCs. AXL expression was also found to be
associated with expression of stem cell genes, regulation of metastases genes, increased
tumorigenicity, and was important for BCSC invasion and migration. Inactivation of AXL also led
to downregulation of NFκB pathway and reduced tumor formation in vivo. Together, our data
suggest that targeted therapy against AXL, in combination with systemic therapies, has the
potential to improve response to anti-cancer therapies and to reduce breast cancer recurrence and
metastases.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Most breast cancer deaths result from disease relapse with invasion and metastases.
Accumulated evidence suggest that breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), which show
resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, drive tumor initiation and disease recurrence.1–3
Recent evidence also suggests that breast cancer stem cells can be generated by epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT), a dedifferentiation program characterized by loss of
epithelial characteristics and adhesion proteins and the acquisition of mesenchymal traits
and invasive properties.4–8 EMT involves coordinated molecular, biochemical and cellular
change resulting in the loss of cell-cell adhesion, apical-basolateral polarity, and epithelial
markers, for acquisition of motility, spindle-cell shape, and mesenchymal markers.
Epithelial cells that undergo EMT lose their epithelial cell characteristics marked by
downregulation of E-cadherin in adherens junctions, occludins and claudins in tight
junctions to acquire a mesenchymal phenotype characterized by upregulation of
mesenchymal proteins vimentin, N-cadherin, fibronectin as well as activation of
transcription factors including Snail, Slug, ZEB1, Zeb2 and Twist.8–10 EMT can be induced
in vitro by treatment of epithelial cells with inducers such as EGF, HGF, PDGF or TGF-β,
matrix metalloproteinases, or through overexpression of Snail or Twist.9, 11

AXL is a member of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK),
originally identified as a transforming gene in cells of chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML) patients. AXL is activated through several mechanisms, including binding of its
ligand, growth arrest specific 6 (Gas6), and extracellular domain-mediated dimerization or
crosstalk with HER2/neu.12–14 AXL is overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers
with significant correlation with tumor stage in breast cancer patients and plays a role in
cancer progression and metastases.15–17 Activation of AXL regulates a number of signal
transduction pathways including NF-κB, STAT, Akt and MAP kinases. AXL is upregulated
by EMT induction and has been shown to mediate acquired resistance in lapatinib-resistant,
HER2/neu-positive and ER-positive BT474 cells.18, 19 However, it has not been shown
whether AXL is sufficient to directly induce EMT or to activate the breast cancer stem cell
phenotype. In this study, we show that AXL is constitutively activated in BCSCs and
induces EMT by regulating the expression of EMT markers such as E- and N-Cadherin,
Snail and Slug. We also show that downregulation of AXL using the tyrosine kinase
inhibitor MP470 (Amuvatinib) reverses EMT in both human and mouse mesechymal cells
which have been induced to undergo EMT, reduces the tumorigenicity of BCSC,
downregulates NFκB pathway and restores sensitivity of the BCSC to chemotherapy. We
also demonstrate that AXL is associated with expression of stem cell marker genes,
regulates metastases genes and plays a role in BCSC migration and invasion.

Results
AXL is unregulated and ligand-independently activated in breast cancer stem cells

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have shown that EMT-induced regulation of AXL plays an essential role in
breast metastases and correlates with poor patient survival.18 We have previously reported
the generation of BCSCs through immune induced EMT4 and have also observed
upregulation of AXL expression in the mesenchymal breast cancer stem cells (Figure 1A).
Here, we assessed whether AXL plays a direct role in EMT induction or regulates the
function of BCSCs. To determine the activation status of AXL in ANV BCSCs, we
measured its phosphorylation at Ser 744 which showed that AXL is activated in ANVs but
not in MMC cells. To determine if AXL activation in ANVs was dependent on GAS6
binding, we treated ANV5 and MMC cells with increasing doses of Gas6. Immunoblotting
of Akt phosphorylation, a downstream target of the AXL pathway, showed no change in Akt
phosphorylation and therefore no increase in AXL activation upon Gas6 stimulation (Figure
1B). In agreement with these results, treating ANV5 cell with increasing doses of Gas6
showed no change in the levels of activated AXL (Figure 1C). Furthermore expression of
Axl and Gas6 mRNAs showed that whereas AXL expression is upregulated in ANV
BCSCs, Gas6 expression was downregulated, confirming that constitutive activation of
AXL is independent of Gas6 binding 9 (Figure 1D).
AXL overexpression induces EMT in human normal and immortalized mammary epithelial
cells

EMT induction has been shown to regulate AXL expression.18 We observed an increase in
AXL expression in mesenchymal cell lines MMCTT and ANV5 cells compared to parental
epithelial MMC cells and MMCTTE epithelial cells derived through mesenchymal to
epithelial transition (MET) of MMCTT cells (Figure 2A, upper panel). We also observed
increased AXL expression in MCF10ATT cells generated from MCF10A treated with TGFβ
and TNF-α (Figure 2A, lower panel). To test whether AXL plays a role in EMT induction,
we assessed the effect of AXL overexpression on expression of EMT markers. The results
showed that AXL overexpression in HMLE cells.5, 20 strongly downregulated E-Cadherin
expression while the expression of mesenchymal markers such as N-Cadherin, Snail and
Slug were upregulated (Figure 2B). A similar result was observed by forced expression of
AXL in normal human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A (Figure 2C). Consistent with
the above results, silencing of AXL using viral mediated shRNA transfection led to
upregulated expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, fibronectin and Snail whiles E-cadherin
expression was downregulated (Figure 2D). Comparable results were found when AXL
expression was depleted in ETTM cells (Figure S1A).21 Change in cell morphology
consistent with MET was also observed in ANV5 and ETTM cells (Figure S1B–C). These
results demonstrated a novel role of AXL in EMT induction and suggest a potential
feedback regulation since AXL is in turn regulated by EMT.
Inactivation of AXL by MP470 reverses epithelial to mesenchymal transition
To further explore the role of AXL in EMT process, we assessed changes in gene expression
profile upon AXL inactivation using AXL inhibitor MP470 (Amuvatinib). MP470 is a
structure-based multi-targeted RTK inhibitor that targets mutant c-Kit, PDGFRα and AXL.

MP470 in combination with Erlotinib targets the HER family/PI3K/Akt pathway and
inhibits tumor growth in prostate cancer and sensitizes glioblastoma cells to
chemotherapy.22, 23 First, transient EMT was induced in MCF10A cells by TGFβ and TNFα
treatment21 to generate mesenchymal MCF10ATT cells followed by treatment with varying
doses of MP470 or DMSO. Pathway analysis using DMSO-treated control cells as a
reference showed differential regulation of EMT markers in mesenchymal MCF10ATT
cells, shown by downregulation of mesenchymal markers Foxc2, Snai1, FGFBP1 and BMP7
and upregulation of MMP9 and Oclnb (Figure 3A). Immunoblotting of protein expression
revealed dose-dependent upregulation of E-Cadherin, β-Catenin and downregulation of NCadherin, phospho-AXL, and Snail expression (Figure 3C). Since MP470 is known as a cMET inhibitor we also evaluated the impact of the inhibitor on levels of both c-MET and its
activated form phosphorylated at tyrosine 1002. As shown in Figure 3C, c-MET was
expressed, albeit weakly in MCF10ATT cells and activation is not detectable. Furthermore,
in parallel with upregulation of epithelial markers and downregulation of mesenchymal
markers, c-MET levels increased of which a small fraction remained activated despite
exposure to MP470. Downregulation of MET in epithelial cells should drive an EMT
phenotype and therefore would not be expected to be activated or expressed in the
mesenchymal MCF10ATT cells.

Author Manuscript

We also assessed the effect of AXL inhibition on mesenchymal phenotype of ANV5 cells.
Gene expression analysis of mRNA isolated from the ANV5 cells previously treated with
the AXL inhibitor showed differential regulation of EMT genes (Figure 3B). Consistent with
these results, immunoblotting of EMT markers showed downregulation of Snail, NCadherin, phosphoAKT as well as upregulation of E-cadherin and β-catenin in response to
treatment with MP470 (Figure 3D). The use of MP470 to inhibit AXL activity also resulted
in downregulation of AXL expression. This could be due to a feedback mechanism whereby
the reversal of EMT caused by AXL inactivation in turn drives down AXL expression since
EMT also functions as an upstream regulator of AXL expression (Figure 2A, lower panel).
It also possible that through a similar mechanism, inactivation of AXL pathway represses
pathways that maintain AXL expression since the pathway is no longer activated. Finally,
since MP470 also targets PDGFRα and c-Met, we assessed the contribution of PDGFRα and
c-Met downregulation on EMT by treating ANV5 cells with imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor
of PDGFR and c-Met, and found no change in N-Cadherin or E-Cadherin expression by
immunoblotting (Figure 3E), suggesting that the observed effect of MP470 on EMT reversal
was due to a combination of AXL activity inhibition and downregulation. Together, these
results show that downregulation of AXL using MP470 reverses EMT and supports the
finding that AXL plays a direct role in EMT induction.

Inactivation of AXL downregulates NFKB pathway
To elucidate the mechanism of AXL regulation of EMT induction, we focused on NFκB
pathway since this pathway acts downstream of Akt pathway and is also a downstream
target of AXL activation.24, 25 To assess the effect of AXL on NFκβ activation, we
determined the expression of components of the NFκB pathway in ANV5 cells treated with
varying doses of MP470 for 72 hours. Immunoblotting showed downregulation of NFκBp65, NFκB-p50 and IκKα as well as upregulation of IκBα kinases (Figure 4A). To confirm

that AXL downregulates NFκB pathway in our cells, we performed NFκB luciferase
reporter assay using viral-mediated transduction of NFκB reporter vector. ANV5 cells
transduced with NFκB reporter viral particles were treated with increasing doses of MP470
or TNFα and assayed for the expression of the luciferase gene. Compared to the controls,
MP470 treated cells showed substantial downregulation of NFκB pathway whereas
activation was increased by TNFα (Figure 4B). To confirm these results, a similar
experiment was performed using anti-AXL antibodies. As expected, cells treated with the
anti-AXL antibody downregulated NFκB pathway activation in dose-dependent manner,
suggesting that NFκB is a downstream target of AXL activation (Figure 4C). Figure 4D
confirms downregulation of both AXL expression and activity upon antibody treatment and
therefore underscores a direct role of AXL in regulating of the NFκB pathway. To show
further proof that NFκB pathway mediates the function of AXL in driving EMT,
MCF10ATT cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, a potent inhibitor of
NFκB and the effect on expression of EMT genes analyzed.26 The results showed that
treatment with MG132 led to increased expression of BMP2, MMP3, KRT14, IGFBP4,
OCLN and SERPINE1 as well as downregulation of ZEB2, COL5A2, AHNAK, SPARC,
WNT5A and CDH2 (Figure 4E) indicating that NFκB pathway may mediate the role of
AXL in regulating EMT phenotype.
AXL expression correlates with increased tumorigenicity in breast cancer stem cells

Author Manuscript

AXL plays a critical role in tumor growth, metastasis, and is associated with poor prognosis
in breast, lung and brain cancers.15–17 AXL was found to be aberrantly expressed in breast
primary tumors.17 To determine whether AXL expression is associated with increased
tumorigenicity, we stained and sorted ANV5 cells into AXL-positive and AXL-negative
populations and implanted into syngeneic mice using unsorted ANV5 cells as a control. The
results showed that ANV5 cells expressing AXL were more tumorigenic compared to AXLnegative population or unsorted ANV5 cells (Figure 5A–B). To validate these results, we
treated ANV5 cells with MP470 in culture to effectively target the BCSCs before injection
into mice. The results showed that inactivation of AXL reduced the tumorigenicity of the
BCSCs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5C). We also generated stable AXL knockdown
and control ANV5 cells for in vivo tumor formation in mice which confirmed the
observation that downregulation of AXL negatively impacted the tumorigenic capacity of
the BCSCs (Figure 5D). These results suggest that AXL also mediates the tumorigenicity of
BCSCs and therefore could serve as a target for modulating breast cancer.
AXL is important for BCSC motility and associates with expression of metastases and
stem cell genes

Author Manuscript

We then assessed the role of AXL in mesenchymal BCSC migration and invasion. Using
stable AXL knockdown and control ANV5 cells, we found that downregulation of AXL
reduced the migration and invasion of AXL depleted ANV5 cells compared to control cells
(Figure 6A–B). To determine whether AXL expression was associated with expression of
stem cell marker genes, we performed gene expression analyses of AXL-positive cells
compared to AXL-negative cells and found increased expression of several stemness genes
that were associated with AXL expression including Isl1, Cdc2a and Bglap1 (Figure 6C).
Despite that, other stemness genes such as Smad9, S100b, Mme, and Col1a1 appeared to be

down regulated. The effect of AXL on expression of metastases genes was also assessed by
gene expression analysis of AXL knockdown cells which also identified several genes to be
differentially regulated upon AXL downregulation (Figure 6D).
MP470 inhibition of AXL decreases self-renewal of BCSCs and restores sensitivity to
chemotherapy

Author Manuscript

Two important functions of BCSCs are their self-renewal capacity and resistance to
chemotherapy. BCSCs are believed to utilize a variety of mechanisms to evade eradication
by conventional therapy such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and radiation.27–30 To
elucidate the role of AXL in BCSC self-renewal, ANV5 cells were treated with MP470 and
then transferred to mammosphere media for anchorage independent growth. Treatment with
AXL inhibitor impacted the ability of the cells to form mammospheres compared to control
treated cells (Figure 7A). A quantification of the number of mammospheres formed is
shown in Figure 7B. We next assessed the effect of AXL inhibition on chemoresistance of
the stem cells. We compared ANV5 cells previously treated with DMSO or MP470
followed by treatment with Salinomycin and assessed cells proliferation and viability by
analyzing the slope of their growth curves. Compared to control treated cells, MP470 treated
cells showed increased sensitivity to chemotherapy (Figure 7C). Similarly, we determined
the effect of Etoposide and Paclitaxel on control and AXL inhibited ANV5 cells and
observed that AXL depleted cells were more sensitive to chemotherapy compared to control
cells (Figure 7D–E). These results together demonstrate that AXL is not only important for
BSCS self-renewal but also mediates the cells’ resistance to chemotherapy, and therefore
properly targeting this pathway could significantly block BCSC function and arrest disease
progression.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In spite of recent improvements in the breast cancer management, such as the use of targeted
therapy which has led to improved patient survival and reduced mortality, recurrence of
breast cancer due to resistance to conventional hormonal and chemotherapy remains a
serious clinical problem. Recent studies have shown that BCSCs, characterized by low
expression of CD24 and high expression of CD44 surface proteins, appear to mediate
resistance to chemotherapy. Although neoplastic transformation of putative tissue stem cells
could give rise to BCSCs, recent studies from several laboratories including ours suggest
that induction of EMT can generate mesenchymal cells with stem cell-like
properties.4, 5, 28–30 A review of the literature on EMT and BCSCs also show that EMT
phenotype in breast cancer cell lines correlates with CD44+/CD24− phenotype.31 It therefore
follows that identification of pathways and targets that are critical to EMT and regulate CSC
function could lead to the development of potent targeted therapy to manage specific
cancers.
The goal of this study was to delineate the role of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL in EMT
induction and regulation of BCSC function. Using AXL overexpression, RNAi mediated
inactivation and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor MP470, we have shown that AXL is
constitutively activated in BCSCs and induce EMT by regulating expression of EMT

markers such as E- and N-Cadherin, Snail and Slug. We also demonstrated that
downregulation of AXL using its inhibitor MP470 reverses EMT in mesenchymal MCF10A
and ANV5 cells, reduces the tumorigenicity of BCSCs, downregulates NFκB pathway and
restores sensitivity of BCSCs to chemotherapy. The results show that AXL expression is
associated with stem cell marker genes, regulates metastases genes and is important for
BCSC motility. AXL has been found to be overexpressed in a number of carcinomas and
malignancies including ovary, brain, lung, colon, breast, kidney, melanoma and
osteosarcoma.15, 17, 32–38 AXL expression also correlated with reduced overall survival and
recurrence-free survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Its expression in primary
breast cancers also independently predicted reduced overall survival with substantial
increased expression in metastases lesions.18, 39 Gjerdrum and colleagues recently showed
that AXL expression was upregulated during EMT, meaning that AXL is a downstream
target of EMT.18 Vimentin, a marker of EMT, has been shown to regulate AXL expression
and also mediate slug induced EMT.40 Our results extended these findings and identified a
novel function of AXL as an upstream regulator of EMT induction. Furthermore,
downregulation of AXL using a small molecule inhibitor MP470 reversed mesenchymal
phenotype of BCSCs, suggesting a possible feedback loop mechanism of regulation of
EMT. Although EMT inducers and AXL regulators such as Zeb1, Twist and Snail have
shown association with poor prognosis of breast cancer, no correlation was found between
AXL expression and E-cadherin in the study by Gjerdrum and colleagues despite both being
downstream targets of EMT.18, 41, 42 It is however not clear whether a homogenous patient
sample was used in that study which could affect the ability to detect any such association.

AXL has been shown to play an important role in invasion and cell survival in breast cancer,
malignant melanoma, glioma, and liver cancers. Downregulation of AXL in breast cancer or
pancreatic ductal carcinomas using siRNAs or Src/Abl inhibitor, bosutinib abolished Gas6dependent AXL activation of Akt resulting in decreased cell invasion, motility, and survival
of the breast and pancreatic cancers.17, 34, 39, 43, 44 A potent small-molecule AXL inhibitor
R428 also blocked AXL functions in Akt phosphorylation, cell invasion and cancer
metastases.45 AXL expression is also retained in metastases with strong correlation with
breast cancer mortality, suggesting that the expression of the kinase could be directly linked
to metastasis progression.18 Our results also show that AXL expression in BCSCs is
associated with differential expression of metastases genes and is important for BCSC
migration and invasion, which corroborates findings of similar roles of AXL in other
cancers. We also established that downregulation of AXL using MP470 reduced the
tumorigenicity of cancer cells and restored the sensitivity of BCSC to chemotherapy
suggesting an important role of AXL in chemo-resistance, particularly in cancer stem cells.
This is consistent with studies showing that inactivation of AXL using monoclonal
antibodies and RNAi interference attenuated tumor growth, reduced cell survival and
enhanced the effect of anti-cancer therapies.39, 46
In conclusion, we have shown that AXL is constitutively activated in BCSCs and induce
EMT through direct regulation of expression of EMT markers such as E- and N-Cadherin,
Snail and Slug. Furthermore, downregulation of AXL using its inhibitor MP470 reversed
EMT in mesenchymal MCF10A and ANV5 cells, reduces the tumor growth, downregulates
NFκB pathway and restores sensitivity of the BCSC to chemotherapy. We also demonstrate

that AXL expression associated with stem cell gene, regulates metastases genes and is
important for BCSC motility. These results demonstrate the potential of AXL as an
important therapeutic target capable of targeting not only the bulk of epithelial cells of the
tumor but also embedded CSCs responsible for resistance chemotherapy and recurrence.
This also means that a combinatorial therapeutic approach to blocking EMT induction of
epithelial cells and preventing CSC survival, chemoresistance, and tumorigenicity could be a
better approach than strategies targeting the epithelial tumor cells or CSCs alone.

horse serum, epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, hydrocortisone, and antibiotics, except
that HMLE media included MEGM in 1:1 ratio to DMEM/F12. ATCC conducted
authentication on the above cell lines through short tandem repeat profiling, karyotyping,
and cytochrome c oxidase I testing. Test for bacterial and fungal contamination was carried
out by ATCC by using current United States Pharmacopeia methods for viral testing
adhering to United States Code of Federal Regulation (9 CFR 113.53) guidelines,
mycoplasma testing via direct culture and Hoechst DNA staining and Limulus amoebocyte
lysate assay to measure endotoxin values. HMLE cells were validated in Dr. Weinbergs’
laboratory. Prior to being used in experiments, all cell lines were treated with Plasmocin
(InvivoGen) for two weeks to prevent mycoplasma contamination. Transient mesenchymal
MCF10A cells were generated by treatment of MCF10A cells with 100ng/ml of TGFβ and

For mammosphere formation, ANV5 and MP470-treated ANV5 cells were maintained in 4
mls DMEM/F12 media with 1:50 B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL EGF, 20 ng/mL, 10 µg/mL
insulin, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B in 12-well plates at a density of 5,000
cells/mL as described previously.47 Additional 0.5mLs of media were added every 3 days
for 15 days. The number of mammospheres formed were observed and counted under a
Leica DC 200 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL). Images of spheroids and
adherent cells were obtained with a Leica DC 200 microscope (Leica Microsystems) and
Fujifilm FinePix 6800 Zoom camera (Fujifilm, Valhalla, NY).

transwells (24-well inserts; pore size, 8 µm; BD Biosciences). About 5 × 104 cells suspended
in serum free medium were plated in the top chamber of the transwell and medium
supplemented with serum was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber. The invasion
assay was conducted as described for migration assay using 1.5 × 105 cells and matrigelcoated membrane (24-well insert, pore size, 8 µm; BD Biosciences). After 24 hrs of
incubation, cells remaining on top of the membrane and those that did not migrate were
removed using a cotton swab. Migrated cells on the lower surface of the membrane were
stained with Hema 3 Stain (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), photographed, and counted.
Chemotherapy and cytotoxicity assays

Author Manuscript

Chemo-sensitivity assays were performed using the Xcelligence unit (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN) as previously described21 or the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega). DMSO or MP470
treated ANV5 cells were counted and seeded in xCelligence E-plates (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN). The xCelligence plates measure impedance in real time generating a growth. Faster
growth leads to steeper growth curve slopes. After 18 hrs, MP470 treated and control cells
were then treated with 10µM salinomycin and the slopes of the growth curves calculated.
Stable AXL knockdown ANV5 cells (ANV5-AXL shRNA) and control ANV5 cells (PLKANV5) growing in E-plates were also treated with 10µM and 20µM Etoposide and the
growth of the cells recorded in real time followed by determination of slope. For CellTiterGlo assay, ANV5 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of MP470 for 48hrs
followed by paclitaxel treatment for another 48hrs. The number of metabolically active cells
was determined by measuring the amount of ATP produced after cell lysis which was
measured in relative luminescence units (RLU). The drugs Etoposide and Salinomycin were
purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA).
NFκB Luciferase reporter Assay
Lentiviral stocks of NFκB reporter vectors (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were transduced into
ANV5 cells for 24 hrs and then treated with varying doses (5µM, 10µm and 15µM) of
MP470 or treated with AXL antibody (1 to 6ug/ml). TNFα was added as a positive control.

After 6 hrs of incubation, equal volume (100µl) of Bright-Glow luciferase substrate
(Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and analyzed on a Victor 3 fluorometer.
NFκB pathway activation was determined by the luciferase activity measured in relative
luciferase units (RLU).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows,
GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, (www.graphpad.com). Two-tailed Student's
t-test, the Mann-Whitney Test, One-way analysis of variance or the Two-way ANOVA test
was performed followed by the Bonferroni post test to determine statistically significant
difference. p < 0.05 was considered as significant.
