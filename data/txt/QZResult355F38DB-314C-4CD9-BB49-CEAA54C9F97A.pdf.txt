Abstract
Eradicating cancer stem-like cells (CSC) may be essential to fully eradicate cancer. Metabolic changes in CSC
could hold a key to their targeting. Here, we report that the dietary micronutrient selenium can trigger apoptosis
of CSC derived from chronic or acute myelogenous leukemias when administered at supraphysiologic but nontoxic doses. In leukemia CSC, selenium treatment activated ATM-p53–dependent apoptosis accompanied by
increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Importantly, the same treatment did not trigger apoptosis
in hematopoietic stem cells. Serial transplantation studies with BCR–ABL-expressing CSC revealed that the selenium status in mice was a key determinant of CSC survival. Selenium action relied upon the endogenous production
of the cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins D12-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2. Accordingly, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs and NADPH oxidase inhibitors abrogated the ability of selenium to trigger apoptosis in leukemia CSC.
Our results reveal how selenium-dependent modulation of arachidonic acid metabolism can be directed to trigger
apoptosis of primary human and murine CSC in leukemia. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3890–901. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Leukemia is a hierarchical disease in which leukemia stem
cells (LSC) occupy the apex and give rise to bulk leukemia
cells that are responsible for the pathology of the disease.
However, unlike LSCs, bulk leukemia cells are unable to
initiate leukemia when transplanted into secondary recipients. Because of this property, LSCs represent a challenge to
current therapy in that they can actively resist chemotherapy regimens and cause relapse of the disease (1, 2). In
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the BCR–ABL1 fusion
protein generated from the 9:22 translocation is capable of
generating LSCs when expressed in hematopoietic stem cells
(HSC; ref. 3). Although current treatment using tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI) can block the production of bulk
leukemia cells and lead to remission of CML, these agents do
not affect LSCs (1). Therefore, new therapies are needed that
target LSCs to prevent relapse following traditional TKI
therapy.

Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (CyPG), D12-PGJ2 and 15dPGJ2, are derived from the polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid (ARA), via the sequential action of cyclooxygenases
(COX) and PGD2 synthases (PGDS) followed by nonenzymatic
conversion of PGD2 to D12-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2 (4, 5). We have
recently demonstrated the ability of D12-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2 to
selectively activate the p53-dependent pathway of apoptosis in
LSCs, without affecting the (normal) HSCs in a murine model
of CML and in an unrelated model of Friend virus–induced
erythroleukemia (6). The importance of the COX pathway in
leukemia has been highlighted in a few epidemiologic studies
in which increasing incidences of leukemia were associated
with non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAID) consumption (7, 8), which led us to study strategies to increase
endogenous CyPGs for treatment of leukemia. Previous studies
have shown supplementation of mice or macrophages with
selenium, a micronutrient that functions through insertion
into redox-active selenoproteins, led to enhanced production
of CyPGs as opposed to proinﬂammatory PGE2, TXA2, or PGF2a
through a process termed "eicosanoid class switching" (9, 10).
Therefore, we hypothesized that supraphysiologic levels of
selenium may play a key role in treating leukemia through
the ability of endogenous CyPGs to target LSCs. In fact, low
serum selenium levels have been noted in leukemic patients
(11–16). On the other hand, use of selenium-cystine (as diselenodialanine) in leukemic patients decreased total leukocyte
count, immature leukocytes in patients with CML and acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML; ref. 17). Antileukemic effect of
sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) was suggested to activate p53 to
cause apoptosis (18–24). However, the mechanism by which
selenium activates p53 is not well understood.
In addition to being the guardian of the genome, p53 also
regulates glycolysis and aerobic respiration through oxidative

Selenium Targets Leukemia Stem Cells

phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cancer stem-like cells (CSC;
ref. 25). This process is accompanied by an increase in the
expression of Tigar (TPp53-inducible glycolysis and apoptosis
regulator), Rm2b (Ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase subunit RM2B), and Sco2 (synthesis of cytochrome oxidase-2) that
induce cell-cycle arrest followed by reactive oxygen species
(ROS)–dependent apoptosis of irreparable cells (26–28). However, p53 also upregulated an antioxidant response through a
sestrin-dependent Nrf-2 activation pathway (29). Thus, by
establishing complex regulatory networks involving temporally segregated responses, p53 can cooperate with redox changes
to affect cellular metabolism and survival involving intricate
control of intracellular ROS levels, resulting in diverse outcomes. In fact, the sensitivity of LSCs to agents that target
aberrant antioxidant (glutathione) metabolism (30) further
highlight the importance of intracellular ROS as a means of
inducing apoptosis in LSCs.
Here, we show that selenium-dependent modulation of the
ARA pathway is central to the ablation of LSCs in vivo.
Treatment of selenium-supplemented mice with indomethacin, an NSAID, blunted the protective effects of selenium
implicating endogenous COX metabolites in the activation of
p53 and apoptosis of LSCs. In addition, treatment of blood
samples from human patients with AML and blast-crisis CML
with lipid extracts (LE) from selenium-supplemented macrophages induced apoptosis in CD34þCD38CD123þ LSCs,
which was blocked by NSAIDs. The proapoptotic effects of
selenium were, in part, related to exacerbated oxidative stress
in LSCs that involved NADPH oxidases, particularly Nox1. In
contrast, selenium treatment did not affect normal HSCs,
suggesting that LSCs are uniquely sensitive to changes in
intracellular ROS. These studies suggest a new mechanism
that underlies the selenium-dependent effects on the viability
of LSCs, which may open new opportunities for leukemia
therapy.

Materials and Methods
Differential selenium status in mice
Three-week-old male BALB/c mice (n ¼ 7/group) for polycythemic Friend virus (FVP) infection or C57BL/6 mice (for
BCR–ABLþLSC transplantation; n ¼ 5–7/group) were weaned
on semipuriﬁed diets (AIN76A; Harlan Teklad) that were either
selenium-deﬁcient (<0.01 ppm Se; Se-D), selenium adequate
(0.08 ppm Se as selenite; Se-A), or selenium supplemented (0.4
ppm Se as selenite; Se-S) for 8 weeks as described earlier (9). In
the FVP infection model, selenium was also used in the form of
an organo-Se compound, methylseleninic acid (MSA) that was
previously shown to be effective in a few in vivo cancer models
(31). Diets were provided ad libitum and mice were maintained
on Milli-Q water throughout the experimental period. Erythrocytes obtained from the retroorbital sinus of mice, maintained
on speciﬁc diets for 3 months, were used to test the expression
of GPX1 as a surrogate marker to conﬁrm the selenium
status (data not shown). All procedures were preapproved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and
Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at The Pennsylvania
State University (University Park, PA).

Induction of Friend erythroleukemia in mice
After completion of the diet-feeding schedule, Balb/c mice
were injected with FVP via the retroorbital sinus. On day 15
after infection, splenomegaly and changes in the hematologic
parameters were assessed as described earlier (32).
Expression of BCR–ABL fusion protein in HSC and
induction of CML in mice
Retroviral stocks were generated by transfecting HEK293T
cells with MIGR–BCR–ABL–IRESGFP or MIGR–IRESGFP
murine stem cell virus retroviral expression system (MSCV)
empty plasmid (kind gift from Dr. Warren Pear, University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) using Fugene 6 transfection
reagent (Roche). Isolation and transduction of HSCs with these
viruses were performed as described earlier (3, 6). LSCs
(GFPþKitþSca1þLin) were isolated from spleen and bone
marrow using FACS (BD Inﬂux Cell Sorter) as described
earlier (3, 6).
Serial transplantation assays
BCR–ABLþLSCs isolated from the bone marrow of a C57BL/
6 CD45.1 donor (as described above) were transplanted into SeA mice on a CD45.2 background. The LSCs (CD45.1þ) isolated
from the bone marrow of primary transplants were used for
secondary transplants in CD45.2þ mice maintained on Se-A or
Se-S diets. The LSCs sorted from the bone marrow (using ﬂow
cytometry) from Se-A or total bone marrow (unsorted) in the
case of Se-S mice were used in a tertiary transplant into
CD45.2þ Se-A mice. Leukocytosis and the presence of LSCs
in the bone marrow and spleen were examined using ﬂow
cytometry.
Histology and TUNEL staining
Formalin-ﬁxed spleens were parafﬁn-embedded, sectioned,
and used for hematoxylin and eosin or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
staining to examine gross anatomical changes or apoptosis,
respectively, following induction of leukemia as described in
the Supplementary Methods.
Gene expression analyses
Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) with TaqMan probes (from
Life Technologies) was performed to examine the gene expression in sorted BCR–ABLþLSCs and HSCs as described in the
Supplementary Methods. Data were analyzed according to the
method of Livak and Schmittgen (33) with normalization to
18S rRNA.
Inhibition of COX-dependent ARA metabolism
Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were administered indomethacin
(0.00325% w/v), a nonselective COX inhibitor, in drinking water
for 2 weeks before FVP infection or LSC (BCR–ABLþHSC)
transplantation, respectively, and continued for two additional
weeks. Apoptosis of LSCs in the spleen and bone marrow was
examined by ﬂow cytometry. For ex vivo experiments, splenocytes containing LSCs or MSCVþHSC–transplanted Se-D mice
were cultured in deﬁned Iscove's modiﬁed Dulbecco's medium
(IMDM; with a basal level of 7 nmol/L selenium) with

increasing amounts of selenium (as selenite; 0–500 nmol/L) in
the presence or absence of DMSO, indomethacin (20 mmol/L; a
general COX inhibitor), HQL-79 (25 mmol/L; H-PGDS inhibitor), CAY10526 (25 mmol/L; mPGES-1 inhibitor) for 36 hours.
Apoptosis of LSCs and HSCs were examined using ﬂow cytometry. To examine the effect of selenium-dependent eicosanoid switching in macrophages on the viability of LSCs, total
lipid extracts (LE) of the culture media from RAW264.7 murine
macrophages (1  106 cells) treated with inhibitors, including
NSAIDs (ibuprofen, 20 mmol/L; naproxen, 50 mmol/L; or aspirin, 2.5 mmol/L) in the presence or absence of selenium
(selenite; 250–500 nmol/L; 3 days), were isolated as described
earlier (6, 9, 10). LE was added to GFPþKitþSca1þLin sorted
murine CML LSCs, or to peripheral blood samples from a
patient with AML as well as a patient with blast-crisis CML for 6
hours. Apoptosis of murine CML and human LSCs (AML and
CML patient-derived; CD34þCD38CD123þ) was examined
using Annexin V staining by ﬂow cytometry. Human samples
were obtained from the University of Rochester (Rochester,
NY). All procedures were preapproved by the IBC and Institutional Review Board at University of Rochester. Western
immunoblotting was performed with sorted murine CML LSCs
or FVP spleen before and after treatments as described in the
Supplementary Methods.
Detection of oxidative stress in LSCs and HSCs
CD34þKitþSca-1þLinGFPþ LSCs and CD34þKitþSca1þLinGFPþ HSCs were isolated from the spleen of LSC- or
HSC-transplanted mice (primary donors) as described earlier.
A total of 5  105 cells were plated in 1 mL of media containing
IMDM supplemented with 15% FBS (ATCC; ﬁnal selenium
concentration of 7 nmol/L) containing 1% v/v BSA (Sigma),
insulin (Sigma; 10 mg/mL), transferrin (Sigma; 200 mg/mL),
L-glutamine (Cellgro; 2 mmol/L), SHH (Peprotech; 50 ng/mL),
SCF (Peprotech; 50 ng/mL), GDF15 (Peprotech; 30 ng/mL), and
recombinant murine IL3 (Peprotech; 10 ng/mL). Following
incubation with compounds for 24 hours at 37 C, 1 mL of
CellROX Deep Red Reagent (Invitrogen) was added to LSCs in 1
mL media to a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nmol/L CellROX
reagent and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. Cells were washed
and resuspended in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline
containing 2% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Cellgro). Oxidized CellROX was analyzed on a BD Accuri C6 ﬂow cytometer
in FL-4 channel.
Effect of NADPH oxidase inhibitors and antioxidants on
LSCs
Sorted CD34þKitþSca1þLin (GFPþ) cells were treated
with selenium (as selenite; 250 nmol/L) in the presence of
NADPH oxidase-1 inhibitors, DPI (diphenyliodonium; 100
nmol/L) or ML-171 (2-acetylphenothiazine; 1 mmol/L) for
24 hours. Similarly, LSCs were treated with NAc (1 mmol/L)
or ebselen (2 mmol/L) for 24 hours and the apoptosis of
GFPþ cells was estimated by ﬂow cytometry with Annexin
V–positive staining. DPI, ML-171, and ebselen were prepared
in DMSO. Final concentration of DMSO was 0.1% v/v. All
data shown were corrected for vehicle-dependent effects
that were minimal.

Results
Selenium supplementation alleviates splenomegaly and
development of leukemia
We investigated whether increased levels of selenium in the
diet affected the development of leukemia in a CML model. In
Se-A recipients, transplantation of BCR–ABLþLSCs led to
splenomegaly and leukocytosis in the peripheral blood that is
characteristic of leukemia (Fig. 1A and B). The CML mice on SeD or Se-A diets did not survive beyond 2 to 3 weeks after
transplantation compared with MSCV-GFPþ HSC–transplanted mice (data not shown). In contrast, transplantation
of BCR–ABLþLSCs into mice maintained on a Se-S diet failed to
cause splenomegaly or leukocytosis (Fig. 1A and B). Analysis of
bone marrow and spleen showed that the Se-S group lacked
detectable LSCs (GFPþKitþSca1þLin; Fig. 1C), which was
consistent with the lack of splenomegaly and leukocytosis (Fig.
1A and B). Similar results were also obtained with the FVP
infection model, in which mice on the Se-S diet were resistant
to FVP-induced erythroleukemia, whereas those on Se-D and
Se-A diet groups succumbed to the disease (Supplementary Fig.
S1). Changes in peripheral blood values of FVP-infected animals such as increased hematocrit (data not shown), leukocytes, reticulocytes, and decreased platelet levels in Se-D and
Se-A diet were consistent with the onset of leukemia (Supplementary Fig. S1). Complete blood count analysis performed in
the FVP-infected mice on Se-S diet exhibited signiﬁcantly
reduced WBCs and reticulocytes when compared with FVPinfected Se-D and Se-A mice. This effect was observed with
selenium supplementation in the form of both inorganic
selenite and organic (and bioavailable) MSA. Flow cytometric
analysis indicated that selenium supplementation with selenite (0.4 ppm) or MSA (3 ppm) signiﬁcantly ablated FVP–LSCs
in the spleen (Supplementary Fig. S1) and bone marrow (data
not shown). Furthermore, histologic examination of the splenic
sections suggested that selenium supplementation also
resulted in a complete return to normal splenic histoarchitecture in the FVP-infected group (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Together, these results support the notion that supraphysiologic levels of selenium speciﬁcally affect the proliferation of
LSCs, but not HSCs.
Supplementation of mice with selenium increases
apoptosis of LSCs
To demonstrate supranutritional levels of selenium in the
diet led to apoptosis of LSCs, we examined splenic sections
from the three diet groups transplanted with LSCs using
TUNEL assays. Increased TUNEL-positive staining in Se-S mice
transplanted with BCR–ABLþLSC was seen when compared
with Se-D or Se-A groups (Fig. 1D). TUNEL staining of the
MSCV-GFPþ–transplanted HSC controls did not show any
changes between the diet groups (data not shown). Increased

TUNEL staining of the splenic sections from FVP-infected Se-S
mice was also seen when compared with the FVP-infected mice
fed Se-D or Se-A diets (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, we
examined the sensitivity of LSCs from Se-D spleen in an ex vivo
analysis of apoptosis in response to exogenous selenium at
concentrations that reﬂect in vivo diet-derived levels. Inorganic
selenium (as sodium selenite) was added at concentrations
varying from 0 to 500 nmol/L to total splenocytes isolated from
Se-D mice transplanted with BCR–ABL–GFPþLSCs or MSCVGFPþ-HSCs. A dose-dependent decrease in GFPþ cells was
seen in the BCR–ABL–GFPþLSCs, whereas the GFPþ cells in
MSCV-GFPþ HSC–transplanted mice treated with identical
doses of selenium did not exhibit a similar response (Fig. 2A).
Interestingly, treatment of these splenocytes containing LSCs
with various forms of organoselenium compounds, such as
MSA, Se-Met, and p-XSC, showed differences in the ability of
these selenocompounds to target LSCs (Fig. 2B). Although not
as effective as inorganic selenite, MSA was relatively more
effective than Se-Met and p-XSC to cause apoptosis of LSCs.
Taken together, these ﬁndings demonstrate that the ability of
selenium to target LSCs for apoptosis is dependent on the form
and dose of selenium.

assay, we generated LSCs using congenic CD45.1 mice
(GFPþKitþSca1þLin). These LSCs from CD45.1 mice were
transplanted into Se-A or Se-S CD45.2 mice and the progression of the disease was followed (Fig. 3A). Only the secondary
transplants into Se-A recipients led to the development of the
disease, whereas bone marrow transplants from Se-A donors
into Se-S recipients failed to cause leukemia. Flow cytometric
analysis of the spleen in these secondary recipients showed
total absence of LSCs only in the Se-S group (Fig. 3B). Splenomegaly and leukocytosis was observed only in the Se-A recipients, but not in the Se-S group (Fig. 3C and D). LSCs in the
bone marrow of secondary transplant Se-S recipients could not
be detected, which is in contrast with those recipients that
were on Se-A diets (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, we performed
tertiary bone marrow transplants into Se-A recipients, in which
complete bone marrow was used. As expected, transplantation
from Se-A (secondary) donors led to the disease, as seen in the
form of LSCs in the bone marrow and spleen (Fig. 3F), whereas
total bone marrow from Se-S donor (secondary) failed to cause
leukemia in tertiary Se-A recipients (Fig. 3G and H). These
studies suggest that supraphysiologic levels (0.4 ppm) of
selenium limit the survival of LSCs.

Serial transplantation of LSCs from Se-S mice fails to
cause leukemia
Serial transplantation assays were used to further demonstrate that Se-S mice did not contain residual LSCs. In this

KitþSca1þLin LSCs; however, cotreatment with HQL-79 or
indomethacin completely blocked the proapoptotic effect of
selenium (Fig. 4A and B). In contrast, inhibition of mPGES-1
had no effect on the selenium-dependent apoptosis of LSCs
(Fig. 4A). To further validate the antileukemic role of endogenous eicosanoids, Se-S mice were pretreated with indomethacin followed by transplantation of LSCs. Consistent with the
in vitro results, transplantation of BCR–ABLþLSCs into these
indomethacin-treated Se-S mice blocked the protective role of
selenium, resulting in increased white blood cell count
(WBC), lymphocytes, and neutrophils (Fig. 4C and D). Flow
cytometric analysis of the bone marrow of these mice
showed a substantial number of GFPþLSCs that were not
observed in the BCR–ABLþLSC–transplanted Se-S mice
treated with the vehicle (Fig. 4E). The effect of indomethacin
was, however, abrogated by intraperitoneal injection of 15dPGJ2 (at 0.025 mg/kg/d for 1 week). 15d-PGJ2 was able to
signiﬁcantly decrease the LSCs in the bone marrow and
spleen (data not shown). Similarly, the antileukemic effects
of selenium were completely blunted by indomethacin in the
Se-S group infected with FVP. Indomethacin-treated Se-S
mice infected with FVP exhibited increased hematocrit,
WBC, and neutrophils in the peripheral blood along with
an increase in M34þKitþSca1þLin LSCs (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Finally, intraperitoneal administration by 15d-PGJ2
(at 0.025 mg/kg/d for 1 week) to the indomethacin-treated
FVP-infected Se-S mice rescued these mice and led to a
signiﬁcant decrease in LSCs in the bone marrow, whereas
treatment of leukemic FVP-infected mice with 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 (at 0.025 mg/kg/d for 1 week) had no effect on the
viability of LSCs (Supplementary Fig. S4). These data demonstrate a key role for the COX–PGDS axis in the proapoptotic effects of selenium in LSCs.
LEs from selenium-treated macrophages induce
apoptosis in CML and AML patient samples
We next tested whether selenium treatment of macrophages
could induce the production of lipid mediators that would

3894

affect LSCs in human blast-crisis CML and AML patientderived samples. Only the LE isolated from macrophages
cultured in selenium-supplemented media led to signiﬁcant
apoptosis of CD34þCD38CD123þ LSCs. In contrast, LE isolated from HQL-79–treated or NSAID-treated RAW 264.7
macrophages failed to induce apoptosis of LSCs in both AML
(Fig. 4F) and blast-crisis CML samples (Fig. 4G). Furthermore,
treatment of human AML and blast-crisis CML samples with
D12-PGJ2 (100 nmol/L) signiﬁcantly reduced their colony-forming ability in methylcellulose media (data not shown). Taken
together, these ﬁndings demonstrate that selenium-dependent
shunting of the ARA pathway, leading to the production of
CyPGs, effectively targets murine and human LSCs for
apoptosis.
Selenium induces oxidative stress in LSCs
ROS production was examined in sorted BCR–ABLþLSCs
and MSCV-GFPþHSCs upon treatment with selenium or LEs
from selenium-treated macrophages. When compared with
HSCs, BCR–ABL GFPþ LSCs expressed lower levels of ROS (Fig.
5A). Addition of selenium in the form of selenite (250–500
nmol/L) or LEs from selenium-treated macrophages signiﬁcantly increased ROS in LSCs. In contrast, cotreatment of
selenium (500 nmol/L) with NSAIDs (indomethacin and aspirin) or LEs from NSAID (indomethacin, aspirin, ibuprofen, or
naproxen)-treated selenium-supplemented (500 nmol/L)
macrophages decreased ROS in the LSCs (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, addition of increasing amounts of selenite failed to
increase ROS in HSCs and cotreatment of selenium (500
nmol/L) with NSAIDs had little effect on ROS levels in HSCs
(Fig. 5C). Treatment of BCR–ABLþLSCs with D12-PGJ2 or 15dPGJ2 (at 25 nmol/L) increased intracellular ROS in LSCs to
levels that were seen in LSCs treated with H2O2 or daunorubicin (Fig. 5D). LSCs treated with selenium showed a significant increase in the expression of NADPH oxidase Nox1, but
not Nox2 and, Nox3 was decreased (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Treatment of BCR–ABLþLSCs with NAc, an antioxidant prodrug, or NOX inhibitors such as DPI or ML171, blocked the

ROS in LSCs were accompanied by dose-dependent increase in
the expression of two important antioxidant genes, Sod2 and
Cat, whereas a similar treatment failed to increase such an
antioxidant response in HSCs (Fig. 5F). A similar trend was also
observed in LSCs from FVP-infected spleen in which the
expression of Cat and Sod2 was upregulated in the Se-S diet
fed groups (Supplementary Fig. S6). BCR–ABLþLSCs treated

(Fig. 5E). Indomethacin treatment of Se-S BCR–ABLþLSCs or
LEs from indomethacin-treated macrophages cultured with
selenium abrogated the increase in Sod2 and Cat. In addition to
these antioxidant genes, we analyzed the expression of a few
p53 target genes, particularly those that regulate glycolysis and
OXPHOS, in LSCs and HSCs following treatment with selenium.

suggest that selenium exacerbates the production of intracellular ROS, in part, by suppressing pathways that offer antioxidant protection while activating mitochondrial OXPHOSdependent ROS production that subsequently leads to apoptosis of LSCs.

(Fig. 6B), HQL-79, and other NSAIDs (Fig. 6C). In contrast
with the response in LSCs, treatment of HSCs with selenium
or LEs had no effect on p53 expression (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, pretreatment of splenocytes from BCR–ABL GFPþ
LSC–transplanted mice with an ATM kinase inhibitor
(KU55933; 10 nmol/L) followed by treatment with selenite
(250 nmol/L) blocked the proapoptotic effect of selenium
(Fig. 6D). As a consequence of ATM kinase activation,
phosphorylated Chk-2 and P-p53 (Ser15) were increased in
sorted BCR–ABLþLSCs supplemented with selenium (100
and 500 nmol/L; Fig. 6E). A similar trend was also observed
in the splenocytes of Se-S and Se-MSA fed groups infected
with FVP (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Increase in the levels of
activated caspase-3 and subsequent cleavage of PARP was
seen in the selenite-treated LSCs. Treatment of AML patient
cells with LEs from selenium-treated macrophages upregulated p53 expression, whereas those from NSAID-treated
macrophages blocked the effect of selenium (Fig. 6F). These
results suggest that selenium-dependent metabolic shunting
of the ARA pathway sensitizes murine CML and human CML
and AML LSCs for apoptosis via the activation of the ATM–
p53 axis.

Discussion
The anticarcinogenic activity of selenium has been demonstrated in many cancer cell lines. However, there are no reports
that speciﬁcally focus on the targeting of CSCs by selenium at
concentrations that are achievable through dietary supplementation without any apparent toxic effects. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism in which selenium supplementation, at supraphysiologic and nontoxic doses, enhances the
production of endogenous PGD2-derived CyPGs to trigger
selective apoptosis of LSCs by increasing intracellular oxidative
stress.
Previous studies have suggested that BCR–ABL expression
was associated with a temporally regulated increase in oxidative stress by modulating upstream signaling events that had a
bearing on cell fate decisions (34–37). This increase was also
associated with induction of self-mutations to encode imatinib
resistance. In contrast, comparison of the baseline ROS levels
in LSCs and HSCs from Se-D mice indicated that the HSCs
produced relatively higher ROS compared with the LSCs. The
explanation for the discrepancy could be attributed to the use
of a model system in which the selenium levels are well deﬁned
as opposed to the use of samples from cell lines or donors with
unknown selenium status (36), which could have a signiﬁcant
bearing on the intracellular ROS levels. In addition, BCR–ABLexpressing HSCs used here are primary cells that differ from
many hematopoietic cell lines previously used to suggest an
association between ROS and BCR–ABL expression (34, 35).
Regardless of the baseline differences in ROS, treatment of
LSCs with selenite or LEs exacerbated oxidative stress.
Although it is not clear how endogenous CyPGs increase ROS,
exogenous addition of high concentrations (mmol/L) of 15dPGJ2 has been shown to increase intracellular iron, possibly as a
bystander effect of electrophilic stress, to exacerbate ROS in
CG3 human thyroid papillary cancer cells (38). This angle is

www.aacrjournals.org

worthy of further investigation to examine whether a similar
mechanism holds good even with low endogenous levels of
CyPGs and/or increased cellular selenium. Needless to say, the
mechanisms by which selenium or endogenous CyPGs activate
the ATM–p53 axis of apoptosis in LSCs are currently being
investigated.
Our studies suggest that selenium in the form of selenoproteins and/or metabolites of selenium may play a critical role in
LSC apoptosis. Increased LSC expression of Sod2, Cat, and
Gpx4 to compensate for increased ROS corroborates well with
the increased expression of Nox1 in LSCs treated with supraphysiologic doses of selenium as reported earlier in other
cancer cells (39). In addition, the ability of two NOX inhibitors,
DPI and ML171, and glutathione precursor prodrug NAc and
ebselen to inhibit selenium-dependent apoptosis further
suggests that LSCs are endowed with a suboptimal antioxidant response system that favors apoptosis. It also seems
that excess selenium overrides these antioxidant defenses,
leading to increased ROS-dependent genomic instability and
apoptosis through an unknown mechanism. This idea is
consistent with the decrease in the expression of Sesn1,
Sesn2, and Gls2 coupled to an increase in the expression of
Sco2, Tigar, and Rm2b (P53r2). These observations point to
the ability of selenium to favor a decrease in aerobic glycolysis in LSCs through the increased expression of Tigar,
which may effectively inhibit glycolysis to activate NADPH
production through the pentose phosphate pathway.
Increased oxygen consumption and mitochondrial respiration as a consequence of upregulated Sco2 and Rm2b could
also contribute to higher levels of ROS to effectively reverse
the Warburg effect to favor apoptosis.
Our studies showed that organic forms of selenium, such as
Se-Met and pXSC, were not as effective as MSA in LSC
apoptosis. Inorganic selenite was more effective than MSA in
vivo (FVP model) and in ex vivo assays with CML LSCs. This is in
contrast with a mammary hyperplastic epithelial tumor model
in which MSA was shown to be more efﬁcacious (31). Such
model-speciﬁc differences in sensitivity could be due to the
inability of these compounds to skew pathways of ARA metabolism to the same extent as selenite (9).
Although our data presented here implicate macrophages as
one of the key producers of PGD2-derived CyPGs, the likelihood
of LSCs also contributing endogenous D12-PGJ2 (and 15d-PGJ2)
in a selenoprotein-dependent manner cannot be ruled out. In
fact, increased production of D12-PGJ2 was accompanied by an
increase in the expression of Hpgds and prominent selenoproteins, Gpx1, Gpx4, and Txnrd1 in LSCs (Supplementary Fig. S8),
which is in agreement with our previous reports in macrophages (9). Although much smaller in magnitude, D12-PGJ2
produced at approximately 6 (nmol/L)/1  106 LSCs in
response to selenite (500 nmol/L) still raises the possibility of
an autocrine mechanism of apoptosis of BCR–ABLþLSCs and
FVP-LSCs (6). However, with the possibility of LSCs being
outnumbered by monocytes, macrophages, and T cells, which
express COX-1/2 and H-PGDS (5, 40, 41) in the spleen and bone
marrow microenvironment, the role of the immune component as CyPG producers in response to selenium cannot be
ignored. Regardless of the origin of CyPGs, the ability of

selenoproteins to increase sensitivity of only the LSCs to
endogenous CyPGs is intriguing and needs to be probed
further.
The abrogation of increased sensitivity of LSCs to selenium with NSAIDs and HQL-79 suggests that the endogenous prostanoids, speciﬁcally PGD2-derived CyPGs, mediate
the selective eradication of LSCs. Interestingly, the role of
COX in leukemia has been implicated in epidemiologic
studies. An increased risk of adult leukemia was associated
with the use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs (7, 8). Hart
reported that indomethacin increased mortality of mice
bearing BCL1 leukemia (42). Thus, our studies suggest a
confounding role for NSAIDs in clinical trials, particularly
those involving supraphysiologic levels of selenium as in the
Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial for prostate cancer (43, 44), in which NSAID users were not excluded
from the study.
In conclusion, we report the ability of selenium to selectively
eradicate LSCs in two well-studied murine models of leukemia
and also in AML and blast-crisis CML patient samples. Our
data support endogenous eicosanoids, such as CyPGs, to be
critical in the proapoptotic function of selenium. The selectivity of endogenous CyPGs to target the LSCs for apoptosis
highlights the importance of redox-dependent pathways as
major determinants of LSC viability. Although these studies
suggest the use of selenium supplementation as an adjunct
therapy for CML, the success of this therapy will ultimately rest
on the efﬁcient expression of selenoproteins and their ability to
skew ARA metabolism to upregulate CyPG production.
