Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cell cycle checkpoints ensure genome integrity and are frequently compromised in human
cancers. A therapeutic strategy being explored takes advantage of checkpoint defects in p53
deficient tumors in order to sensitize them to DNA damaging agents by eliminating Chk1mediated checkpoint responses. Using mouse models, we demonstrated that p21 is a key
determinant of how cells respond to the combination of DNA damage and Chk1 inhibition
(combination therapy) in normal cells as well as in tumors. Loss of p21 sensitized normal cells to
the combination therapy much more than did p53 loss and the enhanced lethality was partially
blocked by CDK inhibition. In addition, basal pools of 21 (p53-independent) provided p53 null
cells with protection from the combination therapy. Our results uncover a novel p53-independent
function for p21 in protecting cells from the lethal effects of DNA damage followed by
Chk1inhibition. Since p21 levels are low in a significant fraction of colorectal tumors, they are
predicted to be particularly sensitive to the combination therapy. Results reported in this study
support this prediction.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

When exposed to DNA damaging agents, eukaryotic cells die, senesce or arrest their
division cycles to allow time for DNA repair. The p53 and Chk1 proteins mediate cell cycle
arrest in the G1-, S -and G2-phases of the cell division cycle under these conditions. p53
accomplishes this through transcriptional activation of downstream targets including p21 (1)
whereas Chk1 promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of the Cdc25A protein
phosphatase (2–7). TP53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers and
cells lacking a functional p53 pathway are unable to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell
division cycle. p53 deficient tumor cells maintain their ability to arrest in the Sand G2phases of the cell division cycle due to Chk1 activity. However, they are compromised in
their ability to sustain these arrests (1). Importantly, Chk1 inhibitors selectively potentiate
the cytotoxictiy of DNA damaging agents in tumor cells with nonfunctional p53 (8).
Treating p53 deficient tumor cells with a DNA damaging agent or anti-metabolite followed
by a Chk1 inhibitor causes tumor cells to move through the Sand G2-checkpoints with DNA
damage and ultimately to die (9–13). Thus, combining Chk1 inhibitors with agents that
induce genotoxic stress represents a therapeutic strategy to selectively target tumors with
intrinsic checkpoint defects while minimizing toxicity in normal cells. Importantly, lowering
Chk1 levels with Chk1-specific siRNAs, induces bypass of both the S- and G2-checkpoints
in p53-deficient cells thereby phenocopying effects observed with Chk1 inhibitors (4).
These studies validate Chk1 therapeutic target for treating p53-deficient tumors.

While performing studies to evaluate the dependency of p53 status on cellular responses to
the therapies that combine DNA damage with Chk1 inhibitors, it became apparent that
studies published to date relied on tumor cells cultured either ex vivo or as xenografts in
rodents. Under these conditions, the individual contributions made by p53 mutation to
experimental outcome cannot be directly assessed due to the plethora of additional
uncharacterized mutations and genomic alterations present in these established cell lines.
Furthermore, the transcriptional targets of p53 that protect cells from bypassing checkpoints
in the presence of DNA damage and Chk1 inhibition have not been identified. p53 maintains
checkpoint responses through transcriptional activation of several genes including p21,
14-3-3σ and Gadd45 (14). p21 loss has been reported in a majority of colon tumors (15) and
silencing of 14-3-3σ by methylation has been reported in several cancers (16). Hence, it is
important to determine how cells lacking p53 effectors respond to DNA damage coupled
with Chk1 inhibition in order to understand which of these targets play dominant roles in
locking down the cell cycle in the presence of DNA damage. To address these issues, we
employed genetically defined mouse models (wild type, p53 null, p21 null and p53/p21 null
mice) to assess whether DNA damage in combination with Chk1 inhibition selectively kills
cells that are null for p53 but otherwise normal and to determine the role played by both
basal and p53-induced pools of p21 in this process. Advantages of knock-out mouse models
include the ability to study checkpoint control in vivo and the ability to circumvent
mutational heterogeneity associated with tumor cells. Our studies identified p53 status as a
key determinant of how cells with DNA damage respond to Chk1 inhibition and identified a
role for p21, both basal- and p53 induced-pools, in protecting normal epithelial cells and
colorectal tumors from the lethal effects of DNA damage as a single stress or in combination

with Chk1 inhibition. These results indicate that p21 attenuators may sensitize tumors,
independent of their p53 status, to the lethal effects of DNA damage combined with Chk1
inhibition.

Results
DNA damage induced by irinotecan is independent of p53 status but enhanced by p21 loss

Author Manuscript

To specifically address the contribution made by p53 or p21 loss to the response of
otherwise normal epithelial cells to the combination of DNA damage and Chk1 inhibition,
wild type (WT) and p53 null mice were treated with vehicle (saline or DMSO); irinotecan
(DNA damaging agent); UCN-01 (Chk1 inhibitor); or the combination of irinotecan and
UCN-01. UCN-01 in combination with irinotecan is currently being tested in clinical trials
in patients with advanced malignancies (8, 17). Irinotecan specifically damages S-phase
cells by inducing single strand breaks that ultimately give rise to double strand breaks during
the course of DNA replication. This leads to cell cycle arrest in the S- and G2-phases of the
cell division cycle (18). Mice of 6 to 8 weeks of age were used as this is prior to the time
when p53 null mice exhibit signs of lymphoma. We also focused on crypt epithelial cells of
the small intestine owing to their rapid cell division cycles. Irinotecan treatment caused the
accumulation of p53 (Fig. S1A) and p21 (Fig. S1B) in crypt epithelial cells of WT mice.
Irinotecan also induced the accumulation of p53 in crypt epithelial cells of p21 null mice
(Fig. S1A) and p21 accumulation was shown to be p53-dependent (Fig. S1B).

Author Manuscript

DNA damage was assessed by monitoring for phosphorylation of H2AX (γH2AX) since
phosphorylation of this histone variant is one of the earliest events observed in cells with
DNA double strand breaks (19). γH2AX staining was observed within the proliferating
compartment of crypts (Fig. 1A) and at the base of the villi, which may represent
differentiating progenitors that experienced DNA damage as they replicated in the crypt
prior to their migration up into the villi (denoted by arrows in panel A). As seen in Fig. 1,
γH2AX staining was not detected in vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, ~ 42% of cells
stained positive for γH2AX in irinotecan-treated WT and p53 null mice. Even higher levels
of DNA damage were observed in small intestinal epithelial cells of p21 null mice, with
~60% of cells staining positive for γH2AX.

Author Manuscript

Mice were also treated with UCN-01 alone or in combination with irinotecan and small
intestines were isolated and analyzed for γH2AX. UCN-01 induced a mild DNA damage
response in cells derived from WT and p53 null mice as ~ 2% of these cells stained positive
for γH2AX. This DNA damage response was not unexpected, as partial loss of Chk1 has
been shown to lead to DNA damage in other experimental settings (20). However, in p21
null cells the percentage of γH2AX positive cells increased to ~20% upon UCN-01
treatment. These data demonstrate that the ability of irinotecan or UCN-01, as single agents,
to induce DNA damage in small intestinal epithelial cells is independent of p53 status but
enhanced by p21 loss. The number of γH2AX positive cells was similar between cells
treated with irinotecan alone or with irinotecan followed by UCN-01 (Fig. 1B).

Combination therapy induces apoptosis in p53- and p21-null cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Next, the ability of the combination therapy to cause epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis
was determined by examining small intestinal crypts for the presence of either cleaved
caspase-3 (Fig. 2) or cleaved PARP (Fig. S1C). Apoptosis was not observed in crypt
epithelial cells from vehicle-treated WT or p53 null animals. An occasional crypt epithelial
cell was observed to undergo apoptosis in vehicle treated p21 null mice. Irinotecan induced
apoptosis in ~1 cell per 2 crypts in mice that were WT for p53 (WT mice and p21 null mice)
but not significantly in p53 null mice. As a single agent, UCN-01 did not induce apoptosis in
WT or p53 null cells but a small number of p21 null cells were consistently observed to
undergo apoptosis in vehicle and UCN-01 treated animals (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the
combination therapy was able to induce apoptosis of p53 null cells and the effects were even
more striking in p21 null cells. We also tested a second more selective Chk1 inhibitor,
AZD7762 (13) for its ability to potentiate the effects of irinotecan in p53 and p21 null crypt
epithelial cells. As seen in Fig. S1D, AZD7762 had some activity as a single agent but
greatly enhanced the ability of irinotecan to induce crypt epithelial cells lacking either p53
or p21 to undergo apoptosis.
Bypass of DNA damage checkpoint in cells null for either p53 or p21

Author Manuscript

It has been proposed that DNA damage coupled with Chk1 inhibition induces cells to bypass
DNA damage checkpoints resulting in mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Therefore, we
monitored the ability of irinotecan to induce cell cycle arrest and UCN-01 to abrogate this
arrest. Irintoecan was expected to arrest cells in the S and G2 phases of the cell division
cycle thereby reducing BrdU incorporation and leading to higher levels of Geminin, a
protein specifically expressed in the S- and G2-phases of the cell cycle (21). In addition
levels of phosphorylated histone H3 (phistone H3) a mitotic marker (22, 23) were expected
to be lower in cells with DNA damage due to G2 cell cycle arrest. Crypt epithelial cells of
the small intestines have a high proliferative index in vehicle-treated animals, ~35–40% of
cells stained positive for BrdU (Fig. S2) and Geminin (Fig. 3A). As expected, there was
significant increase in the number of Geminin positive cells (Fig. 3A) as well as a significant
decrease in both the number of BrdU positive (Fig. S2) and phistone H3 positive (Fig. 3B,
C) cells in irinotecan-treated mice, indicative of cell cycle arrest. However, irinotecan was
less effective at inducing cell cycle arrest in p21 null cells compared to WT and p53 null
cells, as shown by the higher percentage of p21 null cells staining positive for BrdU (Fig.
S2) and phistone H3 (Fig. 3B, C) in the presence of DNA damage. At baseline, there were
50% more p21 null cells that stained positive for phistone H3 compared with WT and p53
null cells (Fig. 3B, C). The higher mitotic index in intestinal epithelial cells lacking p21
indicates that p21 loss perturbs normal cell cycle regulatory circuits.

Author Manuscript

It was predicted that when UCN-01 was administered to irinotecan-treated animals,
checkpoint bypass would be observed in p53 null but not p53 WT cells resulting in a
reduction in Geminin staining coincident with an increase in phistone H3 staining. As seen
in Fig. 3, checkpoint bypass was observed in p53 null but not WT cells. Interestingly, p21
null cells were even more sensitive than p53 null cells to the combination treatment as
indicated by the higher numbers of phistone H3 staining cells (Fig. 3B, C).

We next asked whether there was a coincidence of checkpoint bypass and apoptosis in p53
null cells exposed to the combination therapy. This was accomplished by looking for crypt
epithelial cells that co-stained for both phistone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. S3A, B). ~
2% of epithelial cells in crypts of p53 null mice and 8% in crypts of p21 null mice stained
positive for both phistone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 indicating that these cells bypassed the
G2 DNA damage checkpoint, entered into mitosis and engaged the apoptotic pathway (Fig.
S3B). However, there were many more cleaved caspase 3 positive cells than phistone H3
positive cells, suggesting that either apoptosis occurred independent of checkpoint bypass in
these cells or that the timing of organ harvest was not optimal to capture co-stained cells.
Cdk activation is required for combination therapy to induce checkpoint bypass and
apoptosis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Next, the phosphorylation status of Cdk1/2 was examined in lysates prepared from the small
intestines of treated animals (Fig. 4A). Tyrosine 15-phosphorylation (pY15) inhibits the
enzymatic activity of Cdk1/2 (24) and therefore can be used to indirectly assess Cdk activity
under a variety of conditions. As expected pY15 levels increased upon irinotecan-treatment
in each genotype, indicative of Cdk inhibition in response to DNA damage (lanes 2, 6, 10)
and Cdk1/2 became partially dephosphorylated on Y15 when mice were subsequently
treated with UCN-01 (lanes 3, 7, 11). This was an expected result because UCN-01 inhibits
Chk1 causing Cdc25A phosphatase levels to rise resulting in Cdk1/2 dephosphorylation (4).
Although the combination treatment resulted in Cdk1/2 dephosphorylation in all cases,
checkpoint bypass and apoptosis were only observed in crypt epithelial cells lacking p53 or
p21 (Fig. 2, 3). Next, experiments were carried out to determine if Cdk activity is needed in
order for the combination therapy to induce apoptosis (Fig. 4B, C). This was accomplished
by treating mice with purvalanol A, a potent Cdk inhibitor (25). A reduction of the number
of mitotic cells was observed in the small intestines of purvalanol A-treated mice
demonstrating that the drug was bioavailable (Fig. S3C, D). Mice were subjected to the
combination therapy followed by treatment with either vehicle or purvalanol A and small
intestinal crypts were examined for cleaved caspase 3. There was a significant decrease
(~50%) in the number of apoptotic (Fig. 4B, C) crypt epithelial cells in purvalanol A treated
animals compared with vehicle treated controls. Thus, the combination treatment induced
checkpoint bypass and apoptosis, at least in part, through Cdk activation.
Loss of p21 enhances combination treatment induced apoptosis in cells lacking p53

Author Manuscript

Crypt epithelial cells null for p21 but wild-type for p53 exhibited a robust apoptotic
response to the combination therapy (Fig. 2) relative to p53 null cells that retained basal
pools of p21. As expected, p21 was not induced by DNA damage in the absence of p53 (Fig
S1B). The enhanced sensitivity of p21 null cells relative to p53 null cells to the combination
therapy led us to ask if p53-independent (basal) pools of p21 played a role in protecting cells
from the lethal effects of the combination therapy. To do this, double knockout mice lacking
both p21 and p53 were treated with vehicle, irinotecan, UCN-01 or the combination therapy
(Fig. 5 and Fig. S4A–C). Approximately 50% of vehicle-treated cells stained weakly for
γH2AX indicating a significant amount of DNA damage in the absence of exogenous
genotoxic and irinotecan treatment increased both the number and intensity of γH2AX
positive cells (Fig. 5A, B and Fig. S4A, B). As expected, levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated

Cdk rose in cells of irinotecan-treated animals and fell in cells of mice treated with either
UCN-01 alone or the combination therapy (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrated that the
Chk1 pathway was active in these cells and the drugs were bioavailable in the small
intestinal crypts of p53/p21 null animals. Similar to p21 null cells, irinotecan treatment did
not significantly reduce BrdU incorporation (Fig. S4C, D) in p53/p21 double null cells,
suggestive of intrinsic checkpoint defects in these cells. Importantly, the combination
therapy induced checkpoint bypass in p53/p21 double null cells as evidenced by the increase
in the number of mitotic cells observed in cells exposed to the combination treatment
compared with cells exposed to irinotecan alone (Fig 5D, E). In addition, the combination
therapy was capable of driving p53/p21 double null cells into apoptosis (Fig. 5F, G) but not
to the same degree as that observed in cells null for p21 but WT for p53 (Fig. 2B). These
results demonstrated that both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms operate to
induce apoptosis under these conditions and that p53-independent mechanisms were
significantly enhanced in the absence of basal pools of p21. These results reinforce the
conclusion that basal pools (p53 independent) of p21 provide a protective function in p53
null cells.
Loss of p21 enhances ability of combination therapy to drive p53 deficient colorectal
tumor cells into apoptosis

Author Manuscript

Taken together, our results suggested that p21 deficient (p53 proficient) cells should be
more susceptible to cell killing by combination therapies than p53-deficient (p21 proficient)
cells. To test this and to determine the therapeutic efficacy of our findings, we employed an
orthotopic colon cancer model whereby parental and mutant HCT116 tumor cells (1) were
implanted directly into the cecum of immunocompromised mice as described previously
(26). Prior to establishing the orthotopic xenografts, parental and p53 null HCT116 cells
were transfected with plasmids expressing control (Ctrl) shRNAs or p21-specific shRNAs
followed by selection in puromycin. Although HCT116 cells null for p21 have been reported
(27), we detected endogenous p21 in these cells both at the protein and mRNA levels (data
not shown). As seen in Fig. 6A, parental HCT116 cells transfected with Ctrl shRNAs
maintained an intact p53 DNA damage signaling pathway as indicated by the accumulation
of p53 and p21 upon UV-treatment. We were able to achieve knockdown (KD) of p21 in
p53 null HCT116 cells (Fig. 6B, lane 3). Interestingly, when parental HCT116 cells (p53
WT) were knocked down for p21 and selected in puromycin, we observed a concurrent loss
of p53 protein (Fig. S4E). This was not observed in parental HCT116 cells transiently
transfected with plasmids encoding p21-specific shRNAs (Fig. S4F). Thus, p53 expression
was selected against in HCT116 tumor cells lacking p21 function and as a result we were
unable to obtain HCT116 cells that were WT for p53 but knocked down for p21.

Author Manuscript

Next, HCT116 cells (parental, p53 null and p53 null/p21 KD) were engineered to express a
reporter gene encoding click beetle red luciferase, cells were implanted into the cecum of
recipient mice and bioluminescence imaging was employed to demonstrate successful
implantation of tumor cells (Fig. 6C). Mice were then exposed to either vehicle, irinotecan,
AZD7762 (selective Chk1 inhibitor) or the combination of irinotecan and AZD7762.
Tumors were removed and analyzed for phistone H3 (Fig. 6D) and cleaved caspase 3 (Fig.
6E, F). A significant increase in phistone H3 staining was observed in p53 null and p53

null/p21 KD cells compared to parental cells following exposure to the combination therapy.
This indicates that cells deficient in p53 or both p53 and p21 bypassed the G2 DNA damage
checkpoint. The combination therapy induced significantly more apoptosis in cells lacking
both p53 and p21 compared with control and p53 null cells (Fig. 6E, F). Finally, p21 levels
were restored in p53 null/p21 KD HCT116 cells, cells were implanted into the cecum of
recipient mice and mice were treated as outlined above. As seen in Figure S5, restoration of
p21 in p53 null/p21 KD cells significantly reduced their sensitivity to the combination
therapy. These results validated the specificity of the p21-shRNA and confirmed that basal
pools of p21 provide partial protection to p53-deficient tumor cells from the lethal effects of
therapies that combine DNA damage with Chk1 inhibition.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The development of anti-cancer regimens that take advantage of the molecular differences
between normal and cancer cells is highly desirable. TP53 is one of the most frequently
mutated genes in human cancers and, as such, there is great interest in finding anti-cancer
regimens that selectively target p53 deficient tumors. Importantly, Chk1 inhibitors such as
UCN-01 and AZD7762 selectively potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA damaging agents in
tumor cells with nonfunctional p53 (11, 13, 28) and are currently being tested in several
clinical trials (8). In our study, we circumvented the heterogeneity of transformed cells, and
used mouse models to address the contribution made by loss of p53 and its effector p21 in
sensitizing cells to the combination of DNA damage and Chk1 inhibition. Irinotecan as a
single agent induced 10 fold more apoptosis of small intestinal epithelial cells in WT
animals compared with cells from p53 null animals. This was in spite of the fact that levels
of DNA damage induced by irinotecan were similar in WT and p53 null cells. Whereas
irinotecan as a single agent was ineffective at driving p53 null cells into an apoptotic cell
death, we found that treatment with Chk1 inhibitors was capable of enhancing apoptosis in
response to irinotecan in these cells. This result unequivocally demonstrated that p53 is a
significant determinant of how cells respond to DNA damage followed by Chk1 inhibition.

Author Manuscript

Intriguingly, crypt epithelial cells lacking p21 sustained more DNA damage than their WT
or p53 null counterparts following exposure to irinotecan and were more susceptible to cell
killing by the combination therapy. Given the large number of p53-regulated genes, it was
not necessarily expected that the loss of a single target (p21) would have such a profound
effect. These results demonstrated that Chk1 together with p53, largely through its
downstream effector p21, protects crypt epithelial cells from the DNA damaging effects of
irinotecan. In addition, this study demonstrates that p53-independent (basal) pools of p21,
together with Chk1, protect crypt epithelial cells from the DNA damaging effects of
irinotecan. Rodriguez et al. (2006) reported that HCT116 cells lacking p21 were sensitive to
the combination of excess thymidine and Chk1 inhibition and they noted that p21 is induced
when Chk1 is inhibited independent of p53 status. However, their study did not test the
importance of p21 induction in p53 null cells by deleting it nor did they investigate the
mechanism of cell death. Here we report the consequences of deleting p21 (in p53 null
mice) and knocking down p21 (in p53 null tumor cells).

Our results demonstrated that basal pools of p21 (p53-independent) protected crypt
epithelial cells from the DNA damaging effects of irinotecan as both p21 null and p21/p53
null cells exhibited higher levels of DNA damage following exposure to irinotecan than did
cells from WT animals or cells from mice that were null for p53 but WT for p21 (Fig 1B,
5A). Despite similar levels of DNA damage, a higher fraction of crypt epithelial cells null
for p21 (p53 WT) underwent apoptosis compared with crypt epithelial cells null for both
p21 and p53. This suggests that tumors that are proficient in p53 signaling and have low
levels of p21 will be the most susceptible to combination therapies that combine DNA
damage with Chk1 inhibition due to their ability to induce p53-dependent and -independent
forms of apoptosis. In addition, apoptosis observed in treated cells null for both p53 and p21
was higher than that that observed in treated cells null for p53 but WT for p21. Thus,
combining p21 antagonists with the combination therapy (DNA damage and Chk1 inhbition)
is expected to further sensitize p53 deficient tumors to the combination therapy.

p21 has many functions that might explain how p53-independent pools protect cells from the
genotoxic effects of DNA damaging agents and Chk1 inhibitors. p21 inhibits cell cycle
advancement by binding to and inhibiting CDKs (15). In addition to regulating cell cycle
progression, p21 binds to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a DNA polymerase δ
processivity factor, thereby blocking processive DNA synthesis (29). The cytoplasmic pool
of p21 has been shown to regulate apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting the activity of
proteins that induce apoptosis, including procaspase 3, caspases 8 and 10, and the protein
kinases SAPK and ASK1 (30). Paradoxically, low levels of p21 promote assembly of cyclin
D-CDK4/6 complexes and in this capacity has a positive role in promoting cell cycle
advancement (31). In order to distinguish between the these diverse functions of p21 (Cdk
regulator versus apoptotic regulator), we treated mice with the Cdk inhibitor purvalanol A.
Results demonstrated that p21 exerts its protective effect, at least in part, through its ability
to inhibit Cdk activation (Fig. 4C).

Author Manuscript

We also observed that crypt epithelial cells that were null for p53 but otherwise normal
exhibited more modest apoptotic responses to the combination therapy than did p53
deficient cancer cells. In addition, experiments performed with a variety of cultured p53deficient tumor cells have reported 50 to 100 fold more cell death with the combination
therapy than with the DNA damaging alone (18, 32, 33). We measured a ~10 fold difference
in the number of p53 null small intestinal epithelial cells undergoing apoptosis in response
to the two treatment regimens. The differential response of non-transformed p53 mutant
epithelial cells compared with transformed p53 mutant tumor cells to the combination
therapy may be due to oncogenic stress present in p53 mutant tumor cells. Oncogenic stress
activates the ATR/Chk1 pathway (34–36) and tumor cells depend on this signaling pathway
to maintain some semblance of genome stability (37). HCT116 cells, used in this study,
contain homozygous mutations in the mismatch repair gene hMLH1 and this may also
contribute to their sensitivity to the combination therapy. Thus, the differential response of
p53 mutant normal cells versus p53 mutant tumor cells was likely due to the presence of
additional mutations present in tumor cells that make them more vulnerable to cell death
when subjected to DNA damage followed by Chk1 inhibition and points to the usefulness of
this therapeutic strategy in treating cancers lacking a functional p53 pathway.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that p21 status is a significant determinant of how
cells with DNA damage respond to Chk1 inhibition and that p21 provides a protective effect
in response to combination therapies, in both p53 proficient and deficient backgrounds. A
major debilitating side effect of chemotherapy is GI-toxicity. Here we show that p21
protects intestinal epithelium from the toxicity associated with DNA damage and that Chk1
inhibition sensitizes p21 deficient tumors to DNA damaging agents. This is expected to
provide a therapeutic window that facilitates killing of p21 deficient tumor cells while at the
same time limiting G1 toxicity.

sulphoxide (DMSO) and were sacrificed 6h later. For single drug treatments, mice were
injected with either 100 mg/kg irinotecan (Hospira, diluted in saline) and sacrificed 24h
later, or 5 mg/kg UCN-01 (Sigma, dissolved in 30% DMSO) and sacrificed 6h later. For the
combination treatment, mice were injected with 100 mg/kg irinotecan on Day 1; 24h later
(Day 2) they received 5 mg/kg UCN-01 and were sacrificed 6h later. To inhibit Cdk1 in
vivo, mice received 100 mg/kg irinotecan on Day 1; 24h later (Day 2) they were injected
with 5 mg/kg UCN-01; 1h after receiving UCN-01, mice were injected with 68 mg/kg
purvalanol A (Tocris) or vehicle (PEG400: DMSO 50:50) and sacrificed 5h later (Fig 4C).
To ensure the bioavailability of purvalanol A and its ability to inhibit intestinal cell
proliferation, animals were injected with two doses of the drug. 68 mg/kg purvalanol A or
vehicle (PEG 400: DMSO 50:50) was injected followed by a second dose of purvalanol A
(34 mg/kg) or vehicle 1.5h later and sacrificed 1h after the second dose (Fig S3C). The
second dosing was administered because the half-life of purvalanol A in mice is ~1h (38).
For AZD7762 treatment, mice received either 20 mg/kg AZD7762 (Axon Medchem) or
vehicle (11.3% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin diluted in saline) and were sacrificed 5h

later. For the combination treatment, mice were injected with 100 mg/kg irinotecan on Day
1, and 24h later (Day 2) they were injected with 20 mg/kg AZD7762 and sacrificed 5h later.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)
All paraffin embedded intestinal sections were incubated with the following antibodies:
serine139 phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX, Cell Signaling Technology), Geminin (Santa
Cruz), BrdU (Serotec), serine 28 phosphorylated histone H3 (Sigma-Aldrich), cleaved
caspase-3 and cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling Technology). To assay for BrdU incorporation,
mice were injected with BrdU (Amersham) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations (2 ml per 100 g body weight) and sacrificed 30 min later.
Cell culture and transfection

Author Manuscript

Parental and p53 null HCT116 cells (human colon carcinoma cells) were transfected with a
pcDNA plasmid expressing Click Beetle Red Luciferase (CBRluc) reporter linked to EGFP.
Clones stably transfected with CBRluc-EGFP were selected by screening for zeocin
(Invitrogen) resistance. CBRluc-EGFP expressing parental and p53 null HCT116 cells were
transfected with pLKO.1 vector expressing either a p21 targeted shRNA or control shRNA
directed against firefly luciferase (provided by the RNAi consortium of Broad institute and
Children’s discovery institute at Washington University). Stably transfected clones were
selected by screening for puromycin (Invitrogen) resistance. To ensure stable knockdown,
cells expressing p21 shRNA or control shRNA were screened by Western blotting.
Implantation and treatment of orthotopic colon tumors

Author Manuscript

For establishing orthotopic colon tumors, 1.3 × 106 cells were resuspended in 30 μl DMEM
culture medium (GIBCO) and injected into the cecal wall of immunocompromised NOD/
SCID gamma mice (The Jackson Laboratory, NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ stock#
005557). Bioluminescence imaging was performed on days 3 and 7 post injection to monitor
success of tumor implantation and growth. Bioluminescent images were acquired using the
IVIS Lumina (Caliper). Images were analyzed using LivingImage software (Xenogen).
Seven to nine days post implantation; mice were subjected to the following treatment
schedule: t = 0h (Day 1) vehicle/irinotecan; t = 18h (Day 2) vehicle/AZD7762; t = 26h (Day
2) vehicle/AZD7762; t = 50h (Day 3) vehicle/irinotecan; t = 68h (Day 4) AZD7762/vehicle
and mice were sacrificed at t = 73h (Day 4). The following drug doses were used: 100
mg/kg irinotecan and 25 mg/kg AZD7762. 0.9% saline and 11.3% 2-hydroxypropyl-βcyclodextrin diluted in saline were used as the vehicle controls for irinotecan and AZD7762,
respectively.

Figure 7. Model to explain the differential sensitivity of p53 and p21 null cells to DNA damage
alone or combined with loss of Chk1 activity

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

(A) Small intestinal epithelial cells responded to irinotecan by activating a p53-dependent
response pathway leading to the transcriptional activation of genes encoding cell cycle arrest
(p21 and 14-3-3σ) and apoptotic (PUMA) proteins. Activation of cyclin-dependent protein
kinases (Cdks) was prevented by at least two mechanisms including p21 binding and
tyrosine phosphorylation (pY). Two pools of p21 were present in these cells (those that
existed prior to irinotecan-treatment (basal or p53-independent, teal colored) and those that
accumulated after irinotecan-treatment (p53-induced, salmon colored). Although equivalent
levels of DNA damage were observed in p53 proficient and null cells, only p53 proficient
cells underwent apoptosis, due to the accumulation of cell death proteins such as PUMA. In
p21 null cells, DNA damage failed to efficiently inactivate Cdks due to loss of p21 (both
p53-dependent and –independent pools) and cells did not efficiently arrest their cell division
cycles under these conditions. Higher levels of DNA damage and therefore apoptosis (p53dependent) were observed under these conditions. Cells lacking both p21 and p53 sustain
high levels of DNA damage (due to loss of basal and induced pools of p21) but underwent
less apoptosis (due to loss of p53-dependent apoptosis).
(B) Treating small intestinal epithelial cells with irinotecan followed by a Chk1 inhibitor,
resulted in the tyrosine dephosphorylation of Cdks due to the accumulation of the Cdc25A
phosphatase (4). However, both basal and induced p21 pools were able to maintain low Cdk
activity under these conditions. Thus, Chk1 inhibition did not synergize with irinotecan to
induce more DNA damage in normal intestinal epithelial cells. However, in p53 null cells
treated with the combination therapy, loss of tyrosine phosphorylation coupled with loss of
p21 synergized to induce apoptosis. Finally, levels of apoptosis were even higher in cells
lacking p21 because these cells lack Cdk tyrosine phosphorylation as well as basal and
induced pools of p21.
