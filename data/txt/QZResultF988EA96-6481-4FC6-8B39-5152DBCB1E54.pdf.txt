ABSTRACT:
The c-Myc (Myc) oncoprotein is a high-value therapeutic target given that is
deregulated in multiple types of cancer. However, potent small molecule inhibitors
of Myc have been difficult to identify, particularly those whose mechanism relies on
blocking the association between Myc and its obligate heterodimerization partner,
Max. We have recently reported a structure-activity relationship study of one such
small molecule, 10074-G5, and generated an analog, JY-3-094, with significantly
improved ability to prevent or disrupt the association between recombinant Myc
and Max proteins. However, JY-3094 penetrates cells poorly. Here, we show that
esterification of a critical para-carboxylic acid function of JY-3-094 by various blocking
groups significantly improves cellular uptake although it impairs the ability to disrupt
Myc-Max association in vitro. These pro-drugs are highly concentrated within cells
where JY-3-094 is then generated by the action of esterases. However, the prodrugs are also variably susceptible to extracellular esterases, which can deplete
extracellular reservoirs. Furthermore, while JY-3-094 is retained by cells for long
periods of time, much of it is compartmentalized within the cytoplasm in a form that
appears to be less available to interact with Myc. Our results suggest that persistently
high extracellular levels of pro-drug, without excessive susceptibility to extracellular
esterases, are critical to establishing and maintaining intracellular levels of JY-3-094
that are sufficient to provide for long-term inhibition of Myc-Max association. Analogs
of JY-3-094 appear to represent promising small molecule Myc inhibitors that warrant
further optimization.

INTRODUCTION

and clinical implementation have remained elusive for
several reasons. First, unlike the active sites of enzymes,
which typically accommodate inhibitors with high affinity
and specificity, the interacting surfaces of proteins to
which most PPI inhibitors are targeted are typically
large and featureless [1-5]. Moreover, the disruption or

Although small molecule inhibitors of proteinprotein interactions (PPIs) are of significant interest for the
therapy of cancer and other diseases, their identification

prevention of PPIs with small molecules requires that
the latter be able to overcome the high free energy of
association between the protein partners [2, 6, 7]. Despite
these challenges, some success has been obtained with
small molecules such as the nutlins, which disrupt the
interaction between the TP53 tumor suppressor and its
negative regulator HDM2 [8, 9] as well as ABT-737 and
various synthetic α-helix mimetics, which abrogate the
interaction between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members and accelerate programmed cell death [10, 11].
One prominent target of potentially high therapeutic
value in cancer is the c-Myc (Myc) oncoprotein, a bHLHZIP transcription factor that is over-expressed and/
or deregulated by many different tumor types [12-14].
Numerous studies have shown Myc to be necessary for
the sustained proliferation and/or survival of various
transformed cell types and that its inhibition promotes
tumor regression in vivo, even when the inciting
oncogenic stimulus is not typically associated with Myc
de-regulation [15-19]. That even long-term Myc silencing
in vivo is associated with surprisingly mild and generally
reversible side effects [19] further enhances the appeal
of direct Myc inhibition as a rational therapeutic option.
Such findings temper the concern that the pharmacologic
targeting of Myc, which is seldom mutated in cancer and
is expressed by virtually all proliferating cells, would lead
to unacceptable systemic toxicities[6].
We and others have identified small molecules
that perturb the interaction between Myc and its obligate
bHLH-ZIP heterodimerization partner Max. This leads to
a loss of sequence-specific DNA binding, transcriptional
regulation and various Myc-dependent phenotypes [6, 7,
20-28]. We have further demonstrated that some of these
so-called “Myc inhibitors” bind to short, intrinsically
disordered (ID) segments [29-31] within the bHLHZIP domain of the unstructured Myc monomer [32-34].
Ligand binding induces localized conformational changes
that inhibit subsequent heterodimerization with Max or,
in some cases, drive the ordered helical structure of the
Myc-Max ZIP domain into a more disordered state [3335]. At higher concentrations, Myc inhibitors also disrupt
pre-existing Myc-Max heterodimers both free and in
association with consensus E-box-containing doublestranded oligonucleotides [21, 23, 33]. Biophysical
techniques including fluorescence polarization, circular
dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy have provided direct
evidence for at least 3 Myc inhibitor binding sites on the
bHLH-ZIP domain with binding at each ID site occurring
independently of the occupancy status of the others [33,
34].
Whereas the Myc inhibitors we originally identified
tend to be quite specific, their in vitro affinities for Myc
are relatively low and their IC50s for Myc-over-expressing
cells are high [21, 23]. Moreover, in the two cases where
pharmacologic properties have been studied, rapid in vivo
metabolism and poor tumor penetration likely explain
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the lack of significant therapeutic benefit [36, 37]. This
has led to the development of analogs with improved
pharmacologic profiles, more potent Myc-binding and
greater specificity. For example, 10058-F4, one of the
originally reported parental Myc inhibitors [21], binds to a
ca. 10 amino acid ID segment of Myc spanning the bHLH
and ZIP junction (residues 402-412) [33, 34]. Nearly onethird of a large number of 10058-F4 analogs retained
Myc-binding activity, with several being significantly
more active than the parental compound. Improved
anti-proliferative activity of some of these against Mycover-expressing tumor cells generally correlated with a
reduction in intracellular Myc-Max heterodimers [23]. A
subsequent search employing a 3-D pharmacophore model
identified additional structurally diverse Myc inhibitors
some of which also showed improved binding to Myc and
greater potency against tumor cells compared to 10058-F4
[25]. The ease with which active 10058-F4 analogs were
identified in these studies was explained by subsequent
work demonstrating that the proposed models of Myc
inhibitors bound to their target sites [33] actually represent
the average of an ensemble of dynamic structures, each
with similarly low free energies of binding, that occur
as a result of the plasticity of the peptide binding site as
previously proposed for ID regions [29-31].
Another of our originally described Myc inhibitors,
10074-G5
(N-([1,1’-biphenyl]-2-yl)-7-nitrobenzo[c]
[1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-amine) [21] binds to a more
N-terminal region of Myc’s HLH domain ~35 residues
removed from the 10058-F4 binding site [34]. Because
the reported model of Myc-bound 10074-G5 is also
based on the average of multiple dynamic structures of
an ID domain [34], we predicted that, as in the case of
10058-F4, more potent analogs of 10074-G5 should
be attainable. To this end we have recently reported a
structure-activity relationship study of 10074-G5 [28]
that identified a new analog, dubbed JY-3-094, with a
nearly 5-fold improvement in its ability to perturb the
heterodimerization of Myc-Max recombinant proteins. In
testimony to its specificity, JY-3-094 had no effect on Max
homodimers [28]. However, it appeared to penetrate cells
poorly, with high growth inhibitory IC50s against cell lines
such as HL60 promyelocytic leukemia and Daudi Burkitt
lymphoma, which express high Myc levels and tend to be
quite sensitive to other Myc inhibitors [23, 28].
In the current study, we utilized JY-3-094 as a
starting point to investigate how to modify its structure
so as to optimize its cellular uptake and distribution,
its disruption of Myc-Max heterodimers and its antiproliferative effect. We found that esterification of
a critical para-carboxylic acid function of JY-3-094
significantly improved cellular uptake. While these
alterations tended to inhibit Myc-Max disrupting activity
in vitro, the compounds were converted to JY-3-094
following their cellular uptake, although this occurred
at highly variable rates. Live cell confocal imaging and

mass spectroscopic analysis of the intracellular fate of
these pro-drugs suggested that their ability to inhibit MycMax heterodimerization and proliferation was collectively
dependent on the extent to which they could be converted
to JY-3-094, their intracellular retention and their
accessibility to Myc. Together, these studies show that
directed chemical modifications designed to optimizing
cellular uptake and retention represent a useful strategy
for maximizing intracellular levels of Myc inhibitors.

lymphoma cells in a standard proliferation assay (IC50s
>50 μM, Table 1) [21, 23]. These results indicated that
the requirements for 10074-G5 binding to Myc are
more stringent than those for 10058-F4 and that further
modification was needed to optimize cell-based activities.
We reasoned that the ionizable carboxylic acid groups
of JY-3-094 and SF-3-103B might be responsible for
impeding cell entry.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Improved activities of esterified pro-drugs based
on JY-3-094

10074-G5 is highly sensitive to structural
alterations

In an effort to enhance the biological activity of
JY-3-094, we esterified its para-carboxylic acid moiety
with various blocking groups designed to facilitate
cellular uptake while allowing hydrolysis by intracellular
esterases back to JY-3-094 (Group B compoundsSupplementary Fig. S2). As expected, each of these
modified compounds inhibited HL60 and/or Daudi cell
proliferation (Table 1) to variable degrees although only
one, SF-4-017, also retained activity in EMSAs (Fig.
1I-L). Based on the extreme sensitivity of 10074-G5 to
structural changes (Supplementary Fig. S1), it was not
surprising that most Group B compounds also failed
to retain this latter property. Together, these findings
suggested that esterification of the carboxylic acid group,
while generally preventing the compound from disrupting
Myc-Max in vitro, facilitates its cellular uptake whereupon
intracellular esterase-mediated cleavage of the blocking
group regenerates JY-3-094 with its specific Myc-Max
disrupting activity.

Unlike the case of analogs of the Myc inhibitor
10058-F4 [21], a substantial fraction of which retain
the ability to disrupt Myc-Max heterodimers [23], only
2 of 24 tested 10074-G5 analogs, which we refer to as
“Group A” compounds, did so (Supplementary Fig. S1
and ref. 28). IC50s for these compounds (JY-3-094 and
SF-3-103B), determined in Myc-Max(S) EMSAs were
4.4- and 1.7-fold lower, respectively, than for 10074-G5
(Fig. 1 A–H and Supplementary Fig. S5). The specificity
of JY-3-094 and SF-3-103B for Myc-Max(S) heterodimers
was also demonstrated by showing that neither compound
appreciably affected DNA binding by Max(L) homodimers
(IC50s >100 μM) whose free energy of association is
actually less than that of Myc-Max heterodimers [38].
Despite these improvements over the parental 10074-G5
compound neither analog showed appreciable activity

To examine this more carefully, we next asked if
we could demonstrate intracellular disruption of MycMax heterodimers with select Group B compounds.
We therefore exposed HL60 cells to three of the
compounds, precipitated total cell lysates with an antiMax antibody and performed western blotting to identify
co-immunoprecipitated Myc protein[23]. In each case,
we observed reproducible, dose-dependent inhibition of
in situ Myc-Max heterodimer formation at compound
concentrations that correlated well with growth inhibition
assays (Fig. 2 and Table 1). These findings are consistent
with the idea that, while Group B compounds are generally
poor Myc-Max disruptors in EMSAs, they reacquire this
activity following intracellular hydrolysis to JY-3-094.

we used live cell confocal microscopy of adherent human
embryonal kidney (HEK) cells. As seen in Fig. 3 and
Supplementary video 1, an extremely low level of 10074G5 uptake was observed whereas the apparent uptake of
JY-3-094 was below the limits of detection. In contrast,
3 of the 4 tested Group B compounds were taken up
rapidly, persisted within cells at high levels and were
then quickly released and/or converted to non-fluorescent
metabolites following compound removal. Consistent
with them having been optimized for cellular uptake,
these compounds showed 2-3-fold greater fluorescence
intensities upon reaching equilibrium relative to 10074G5 and immeasurably better uptake relative to JY-3-094.
The exception to this behavior occurred with 3JC-91-5.
Although this compound was taken up as rapidly as the
others, and even attained ~7-fold higher peak intracellular
levels, its fluorescent signal rapidly dissipated during the
remainder of the uptake phase. This behavior suggested
that 3JC-91-5 was being converted to a non-florescent
compound and/or to JY-3-094 within cells, which, upon
release, would not be subject to re-uptake. To confirm that
the loss of 3JC-91-5 fluorescence during the uptake phase
of the above experiments was not attributable to a change

Live cell uptake of 10074-G5 and its analogs
We next took advantage of the fact that 10074G5, JY-3-094 and all Group B analogs are fluorescent
(Supplementary Fig. S6). This permitted a real-time
comparison of their cellular uptake and distribution as
well as their release and/or degradation to non-fluorescent
metabolites following their removal. For these studies,

in cellular behavior, the spent medium from cells treated
with this compound was removed after 4 hr. and placed
onto fresh cells. As seen in Supplementary Fig. S7A,
these cells failed to show any evidence for compound
uptake. In contrast, the same experiment performed
with 3JC-91-2, showed that the spent medium contained
sufficient residual compound such that its uptake by fresh
recipient cells could again be detected (Supplementary
Fig. S7B). These results suggest that 3JC-91-5 was being
rapidly metabolized. To investigate precisely where this
was occurring, we repeated the above uptake study with
3JC-91-5 in medium lacking serum. We observed the
same overall fluorescence pattern previously seen in the
presence of serum, namely the attainment of an initially
high peak level of intracellular fluorescence followed
by a decline in signal, albeit at a slower rate than seen
previously (Supplementary Fig. S7C). This suggested
that the more rapid decline of fluorescence in serumcontaining medium was due to the presence of serum
esterases. To address this directly, 3JC-91-5 was incubated
in serum-containing medium for 6 hr in the absence of
cells. We then utilized MS to determine whether any of
the compound had been hydrolyzed to JY-3-094. As
seen in Supplementary Fig. S7D, >80% of 3JC-91-5 was
hydrolyzed to JY-3-094. Together with the cell-based
assays, these results suggest that 3JC-91-5 is hydrolyzed
to JY-3-094 both intra- and extra-cellularly. The extreme

rapidity of the latter process, coupled with the apparent
poor uptake of JY-3-094 appears sufficient to explain the
rapid loss of the fluorescent signal following the addition
of 3JC-91-5 to cells (Fig. 3). That 3JC-91-5 also initially
attains higher intracellular concentrations than other
Group B compounds also likely contributes to its faster
intracellular hydrolysis.
Interestingly, all compounds that could be examined
by live cell confocal microscopy localized primarily to the
cytoplasm where they distributed both diffusely and in a
more concentrated or “speckled” pattern (Fig. 3 inserts).
This suggested that the primary site of interaction of
10074-G5 and Group B compounds with Myc is in the
former compartment where they associate with the
oncoprotein prior to its nuclear translocation. This does
not rule out the possibility that nuclear concentrations of
compounds, while presumably less than those attained in
the cytoplasm, are nonetheless also sufficiently high to
disrupt Myc-Max heterodimers in that compartment as
well.

Further mass spectroscopic evaluation of Group
B compounds
Based on the foregoing findings, we asked if
we could simultaneously detect intracellular Group B
prodrugs and JY-3-094, the common product of esterase-

the indicated concentrations of 3JC-91-2, 3JC-91-7 and SF-4-017. Total cell lysates were then incubated with an anti-Max antibody as
previously described [23] and precipitated with protein-G-agarose. Precipitates were boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF
membranes and probed with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Myc IP). Blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminesce
protocol. The lower panel of each blot shows the total input of Myc protein prior to co-IP. Chemical structures of each compound are shown
adjacent to their respective blots.

mediated hydrolysis. HL-60 cells were therefore cultured
in the presence of 10 μM of each prodrug for 72 h; its
intracellular concentrations and that of JY-3-094 were then
quantified by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 4). Since our aim was to
evaluate the extent of ester hydrolysis of each prodrug to
active JY-3-094, we did not search for other metabolites.
Given that different prodrugs may be internalized and
cleared at different rates, this approach also did not afford
the opportunity to correlate total amounts of prodrug with
total uptake. Exposure to 10 μM of the acetoxymethyl
ester 3JC-91-5 afforded 9.5 μM intracellular concentration
of metabolite (JY-3-094) with no detectable 3JC-915, suggesting 95% uptake of the prodrug, its complete
conversion to JY-3-094 and its long-term intracellular
retention in unmodified form. Similarly high rates of
conversion were seen with methyl and ethyl esters (3JC91-1 and 3JC-91-3, respectively), followed closely by
phenol ester SF-4-017 and then trifluoroethyl ester 3JC91-7. Similar degrees of conversion were observed when
the above studies were repeated in MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S8).
The rate of metabolism of an ester prodrug

depends on the structures of both the acid and the alcohol
component. A simple methyl ester may be metabolized
poorly if the acid portion is not well-accommodated in the
active sites of esterases. The virtually complete conversion
of 3JC-91-5 to JY-3-094 is consistent with the former
compound being a metabolically-active acetoxymethyl
ester as this side chain tends to be efficiently hydrolyzed
through a cascade reaction in which metabolism of the
terminal and sterically accessible acetyl group by esterases
is pursued by a spontaneous chemical reaction to liberate
formaldehyde and the drug [39]. Together with its poor
activity in EMSAs, this suggested that the cytotoxicity
of 3JC-91-5 as well as most other Group B members
was largely attributable to their intracellular conversion
to JY-3-094. On the other hand, given that SF-4-017 is
also modestly active in EMSA-based assays (Fig. 1J), its
cellular effects may be explained by a combination of the
prodrug and JY-3-094.
The finding that high intracellular concentrations
of JY-3-094 could be detected by MS following a 3 d
exposure to 3JC-91-5 initially appeared to conflict with
our prior observation that intracellular fluorescence of

semi-confluent monolayer cultures of HEK cells plated the day before. Myc inhibitors were added to cultures at final concentrations of 10
μM at 37C with quantification of uptake commencing immediately afterwards. Live cell images were obtained at least every 5 min. At the
end of the uptake period (200 min), monolayers were washed free of compounds and the incubation was then continued in compound-free
medium for the remainder of the study. Inserts show typical images of cells taken upon reaching peak compound levels.

3JC-91-5 persisted for only 2-3 hr following its addition
to cells (Fig. 3). In order to resolve this discrepancy, we
repeated the emission profiles of JY-3-094 in aqueous
medium rather than DMSO. As seen in Supplementary
Fig. S9 JY-3-094 lost virtually all its fluorescence in PBS
whereas compounds 3JC-91-2 and SF-4-017, included as
controls, retained this property despite some change in
the appearance of the fluorescence profile. Taken together
with our results obtained by MS, these findings indicate
that the rapid loss of fluorescence signals seen following
the removal of Group B compounds from cells (Fig. 3) is
likely due to the release of non-hydrolyzed intracellular
compound as well as to the lack of fluorescent signal
of JY-094 in an aqueous environment at physiologic
pH following its hydrolytic conversion. We believe this
differential fluorescent behavior of JY-3-094 results
from the ionization of its carboxylic acid group (pKa~5)
in PBS in a manner analogous to that which occurs with
compounds such as phenol and tyrosine upon ionization of
their respective hydroxyl groups at high pH [40].

incapable of being visualized in its aqueous environment.
Group B compounds are similarly susceptible to
intracellular esterases, thus further contributing to the
loss of signal. Group B compounds and JY-3-094 appear
to partition between a diffuse or “free” cytoplasmic state
and a more concentrated or “speckled” state, with Group
B compounds appearing equally prone to hydrolysis in
either state (Fig. 3 and Supplementary video 1). It seems
reasonable to speculate that the diffusely distributed JY3-094 represents the form that is the most available to
inhibit Myc. The degree to which this is achieved likely
reflects a complex combination of factors that includes the
extent of Group B compound uptake, its level and length
of persistence in the extracellular compartment, its rate
of both extra- and intra-cellular hydrolysis to JY-3-094,
its subcellular distribution and the extent to which JY3-094 can effectively interact with Myc. Another factor,
not examined here, includes the rate at which Group B
compounds are differentially metabolized within cells to
compounds other than JY-3-094.

A model for Myc inhibitor action

SUMMARY

The results presented here are most consistent with
the model depicted in Fig. 5 in which Group B compounds
are taken up and concentrated within cells or hydrolyzed
extracellularly to JY-3-094. Whereas the former process
occurs at similar initial rates in all cases (Fig. 3),
hydrolytic rates differ and are dictated by the identity of
the ester linkage. When hydrolytic rates are low, sufficient
extracellular Group B compound persists so as to establish
a longer-term equilibrium between freely interchangeable
intra- and extracellular pools. Alternatively, when ester
hydrolysis is rapid, as in the case of 3JC-91-5, the
extracellular pool is rapidly depleted and reduced to a
form (JY-3-094) that is both poorly taken up and rendered

The current study demonstrates that substantial
lead optimization of 10074-G5 can be achieved by a
combination of pharmacophore identification, which
yielded JY-3-094 [28] and cellular uptake optimization,
which yielded Group B members. By blocking the paracarboxylic group of JY-3-094 and thus neutralizing
a net negative charge that likely contributes to poor
cellular uptake, we greatly enhanced the activity of this
analog while sacrificing its ability to disrupt Myc-Max
heterodimers until being hydrolyzed back to JY-3-094.
Together, these approaches improved compound potency
by almost 5-fold when measured by EMSA and by as
much as 30-50-fold when measured by cell proliferation

assays (Table 1). Despite the difficulty of maintaining
activity in these assays following any modification of
the JY-3-094 core structure, its esterified analogs were
actually considerably more potent when compared to a
larger set of Myc inhibitors derived from 10058-F4, which
binds to a different site on the Myc bHLH-ZIP domain [21,
23, 25]. Our present results are particularly noteworthy
given that 10058-F4 contains a pan-assay interference
rhodanine moiety and an α,β unsaturated ketone group
that could function as a Michael acceptor [41, 42]. JY3-094 and its ester pro-drugs suffer from neither of these
potential drawbacks, thus suggesting that they may be
better candidates for more advanced pharmaceutical
development.
The rapidity with which 3JC-91-5 was hydrolyzed
to JY-3-094 underscores the importance of selecting
the most appropriate blocking group for the purpose
of esterification. Excessive hydrolysis, particularly by
extracellular esterases, can deplete the reservoir of prodrug by converting it to a form that restricts cellular

entry. Future attempts at compound optimization should
perhaps also focus on the generation of prodrugs that are
better retained following their intracellular hydrolysis.
Compounds with a more diffuse cytoplasmic distribution
might also afford better accessibility to Myc, thus raising
their effective intracellular concentrations.
Our combined results suggest that the ability of any
given Group B compound to inhibit cellular proliferation
via the disruption of Myc-Max association is the result of
several factors all working in concert, only some of which
have been quantified here. That most compounds are both
rapidly taken up and released by cells suggests that the
plateau phase represents an equilibrium state during which
time any compound that is released is subject to re-entry
as long as it remains in its pro-drug state. The period over
which this equilibrium is maintained is dependent both on
the total amount of available extracellular prodrug and its
rate of conversion to JY-3-094 within the cell.

Figure 5: Model for Group B compound activity. Esterification of JY-3-094 to yield Group B compounds greatly promotes cellular

uptake but eliminates Myc inhibitory activity. Group B compounds are preferentially concentrated in cells but are susceptible to esterases
(grey arrows) at rates that are determined by the identity of the ester group and the amounts and specificities of the esterases. Group B
compounds are also susceptible to extracellular serum esterases, with highly esterase-susceptible compounds such as 3JC-91-5 being
particularly prone to conversion to JY-3-094 (Fig. 3 and Suppl. Fig. S7). Upon entering cells, Group B compounds may either remain
free within the cytoplasm (f) or become localized in a speckled pattern (Fig. 3) that presumably reflects their binding to proteins (b). The
rates at which ester hydrolysis of free and bound compounds occur need not be identical although they are depicted as being so here.
The hydrolyzed product, JY-3-094, remains bound and unable to interact with Myc (thin arrows). It is not currently known how freely
interchangeable the free and bound states are (?). That virtually all of a compound such as 91-5 is converted intracellularly to JY-3-094 yet
is a relatively weaker inhibitor of proliferation (Table 1) supports the idea that the bound form of JY-3-094 remains unavailable for Myc
interaction despite its prolonged intracellular half-life. In contrast, the more efficient inhibition of Myc-Max heterodimers and proliferation
by compounds such as 3JC-91-1, 3JC-91-2 and 3JC-91-3, despite the lower total levels of JY-3-094 suggests that higher levels of the free
form of the latter compound are maintained by virtue of the persistence of an extracellular reservoir of the former compounds. (*) indicates
that the compound is fluorescent under aqueous conditions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell lines and growth inhibition assays
Human embryonal kidney (HEK) cells were
maintained in Dulbecco’s-modified Eagle’s minimal
essential medium (D-MEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), glutamine and penicillin/
streptomycin as previously described [47]. Human
breast carcinoma MDA-MB231 cells, obtained from
the American Type Culture collection (Manassas, VA),
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. Daudi Burkitt
lymphoma and HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells
[23] were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented
as described above for D-MEM. For growth inhibition
studies, 3 x 103 cells were seeded in 96 well plates in the
presence of serial dilutions of each compound. A total of
10 dilutions, ranging from 0.1 to 50 μM were performed
for each compound. MTT assays [23] were used to
quantify cell number 3-4 d later and compared to wells
exposed to DMSO vehicle only. Each point was assayed in
quadruplicate with the results being presented as the mean
+/- 1 standard error.

Chemical syntheses
Analogs of 10074-G5 shown in Supplementary Fig.
S1 and hereafter referred to as “Group A” compounds
were prepared as described previously [28], or in
Supplementary Materials and Methods. Pro-drugs derived
from JY-3-094, hereafter referred to as ”Group B”
compounds (Supplementary Fig. S2), were prepared as
shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. Briefly, commercially
available 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (compound 1:
Supplementary Fig. S3) was reacted with 4-aminobenzoic
acid to generate JY-3-094. The ester pro-drugs were then
obtained either by direct alkylation of the para-carboxylic
acid of JY-3-094 with the appropriate alkylating
agent, or through a condensation reaction mediated by
O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU). The structures of the
six Group B compounds (3jc-91-1, 3jc-91-2, 3jc-913, 3jc-91-5, 3jc-91-7 and SF-4-017) are given in full in
Supplementary Fig. S2.

Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays

Myc-Max electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSAs)

Co-IP assays were performed essentially as
described previously [23]. Briefly, 5 x 106 HL60 cells
(>90% viable) in log-phase growth were treated in
suspension for 4-6 hr with the stated concentration of
Myc inhibitor. As a negative control, samples exposed
to DMSO vehicle only were included and processed in
parallel. Treated cells were collected by centrifugation,
washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in IP Buffer [23].
300 μg of cleared lysate was then precipitated with a
1:200 dilution of anti-Max antibody [23, 44] followed by
subsequent precipitation with protein G-Sepharose using
conditions recommended by the supplier (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA). The precipitate was
washed three times in IP buffer, boiled in running buffer
and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrotransfer
of the proteins to a PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp.
Billercica, MA), the blot was probed with a 1:1000 dilution
of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Blots were developed
using a Pierce ECL Plus enhanced chemiluminescence kit
according to the directions of the supplier (Thermo-Fisher,
Pittsburgh, PA).

EMSAs were performed essentially as described
utilizing bacterially-expressed recombinant proteins
purified nearly to homogeneity[21, 23]. Experiments
with Max homodimers utilized the His6-tagged 160
amino acid isoform of the protein, termed Max(L) [43],
which homodimerizes and binds DNA well [23, 44]. For
studies with Myc-Max heterodimers, we used the His6tagged 151 residue isoform of Max [Max(S)], which
binds DNA well as a heterodimer with Myc but poorly
as a homodimer [23, 44, 45]. Recombinant Myc protein,
expressed in the pET151 vector, consisted of the His6TEV protease substrate-tagged 85 amino acid bHLH-ZIP
domain [23]. Each protein was purified by Ni-agarose
affinity chromatography as previously described [23,
44, 45]. The His6-TEV tag was removed from the Myc
protein by TEV protease cleavage followed by repurification using Ni-agarose affinity chromatography to
remove the His6-TEV protease and the cleaved His6-TEV
tag as previously described [23]. Binding assays were
performed with 30 nM of each protein and 30 nM of a
6-carboxy-2’,4,4’,5’,7,7’–hexachlorofluorescein (HEX)tagged double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a
consensus Myc binding site (IDT, Coralville, IA) [23, 46].

Live cell confocal imaging
6 x 105 human embryonal kidney cells (HEK293)
were plated in glass bottom 35 mm dishes (MatTek Co.,
Ashland, MA) and allowed to attach overnight at which
point they were generally 60-80% confluent and in log-

phase growth. Myc inhibitors were then added directly
to the medium to the final indicated concentrations.
Throughout the experiment, cells were maintained under
a controlled environmental enclosure at 37C and in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere. All images were taken with a LSM710
laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Munich,
Germany). The following settings were used for all Myc
inhibitors: objective: Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27;
Laser: Excitation 488 nm at 2%, Laser Pinhole 34 mm,
pixel dwell 6.4 mm; Detection filter: 490-735, Digital
Gain 1.0, Digital Offset 0.00, Master gain 740 (for
cmpd) 276 (for DIC); Image size: 1024x1024; Z stack
scan total: 20 µm for 12 stacks. Just prior to the addition
of each compound, images were obtained from which
backgrounds were subtracted from the signals obtained
following compound addition. Images were obtained at
least every 5 min. Image analysis and quantification were
performed with histogram and mean of ROI functions with
ZEN 2009 software.

5 µm) (Thermo Scientific) operated at 30°C. Solvents A
and B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water and CH3CN,
respectively. The gradient program was as follows: 0.00.25 min, 25% B; 0.25-1.25 min, gradient to 65% B;
1.25-2.5 min, gradient to 90% B; 2.5-4.25 min, 90% B;
4.25-4.75 min, gradient to 25% B; 4.75-6.0 min, 25%
B. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min during all separation
steps and injection volume was 10 µL. Detection was
performed in the negative-ion mode and the electrospray
ionization (ESI) source parameters were as follows: spray
voltage, 2750; capillary temperature, 320; sheath gas
pressure, 40; ion sweep gas pressure, 5; capillary offset,
-35; tube lens offset, 100. Selected reaction monitoring
(SRM) was used for mass detection with the following
transitions: 3JC91-1 (m/z 313.1 → 266.3), 3JC91-2 (m/z
389.1 → 342.3), 3JC91-3 (m/z 327.1 → 280.3), 3JC91-5
(m/z 371.1 → 324.3), 3JC91-7 (m/z 381.1 → 334.3), SF-4017 (m/z 375.1 → 328.3), JY-3-094 (m/z 299.1 → 209.3),
and 10074-G5 (m/z 331.1 → 284.3). Data collection and
analysis were performed by Xcalibur V 2.1 (Thermo
Scientific).

LC-MS/MS Method Validation

10074-G5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used
as an internal standard. LC/MS grade water, acetonitrile
(CH3CN), and formic acid were from Thermo-Fisher
Scientific. HL60 cells were grown in suspension to
approximately 106 cells/ml and MDA-MB231 cells were
grown in monolayer cultures to 70–80% confluency in 6
well plates. Fresh culture medium containing 10 μM of
the indicated compounds was then added for 72 hours.
Cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and re-suspended in RIPA buffer (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing 1% Na3PO4, 0.5%
Na-deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS, supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). After a 10
min incubation on ice, the crude cell extracts were quickfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C.

Calibration standards were generated by adding
known amounts of standards (range 0.05 µM to 25 µM)
into neat solution (Water/CH3CN 1:1 with 0.1% formic
acid) and blank cell lysates. The QC samples in the same
concentration as the calibration standards were prepared
separately. Calibration curves were obtained by plotting
the peak area ratio of the standard to the internal standard
against the concentration and linear regression curves
were calculated to check the linearity of the method.
Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ)
were determined as signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and 10,
respectively. Supplementary Fig. S4 shows calibration
curves with LOD and LOQ for each Group B prodrug and
metabolite.
