Author Manuscript

We previously characterized the link between WNT7A and the progression of ovarian cancer.
Other groups have identified FGF1 as a relevant risk factor in ovarian cancer. Here, we show a
linkage between these two signaling pathways that may be exploited to improve treatment and
prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. High expression of WNT7A and FGF1 are correlated in
ovarian carcinomas and poor overall patient survival. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
demonstrated that WNT7A/β-catenin signaling directly regulates FGF1 expression via TCF
binding elements in the FGF1-1C promoter locus. In vitro gene manipulation studies revealed that
FGF1 is sufficient to drive the tumor promoting effects of WNT7A. In vivo xenograft studies
confirmed that the stable overexpression of WNT7A or FGF1 induced a significant increase in
tumor incidence, while FGF1 knockdown in WNT7A overexpressing cells caused a significant
reduction in tumor size. Niclosamide most efficiently abrogated WNT7A/β-catenin signaling in
our model, inhibited β-catenin transcriptional activity and cell viability, and increased cell death.
Furthermore, niclosamide decreased cell migration following an increase in E-cadherin subsequent
to decreased levels of SLUG. The effects of niclosamide on cell functions were more potent in
WNT7A overexpressing cells. Oral niclosamide inhibited tumor growth and progression in an
intraperitoneal xenograft mouse model representative of human ovarian cancer. Collectively, these
results indicate that FGF1 is a direct downstream target of WNT7A/β-catenin signaling and this
pathway has potential as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. Moreover, niclosamide is a
promising inhibitor of this pathway and may have clinical relevance.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Ovarian cancer (OvCa) remains the most common cause of death from gynecological
malignancies and is the fifth leading overall cause of death from cancer in women. In 2014,
approximately 22,000 new OvCa cases and 14,500 deaths are estimated from OvCa in the
United States.1 The dearth of specific signs, symptoms, or efficient early detection markers
for this disease contributes to its diagnosis at advanced stages, resulting in low overall
survival. Indeed, more than 75% of OvCa cases are diagnosed when there is widely
metastatic disease in the peritoneal cavity.2 Therefore, it is important to identify therapeutic
targets and efficient drugs that can improve current OvCa treatment by preventing its
dissemination.

WNT genes encode secreted glycoproteins, acting through frizzled receptor (FZD), that
control cell fate, mortality, proliferation, differentiation and tissue growth.3, 4 Gene
mutations and changes in the expression of extracellular inhibitors and intranuclear
transcription cofactors within the WNT pathway promote tumor progression and
metastasis.5, 6 The canonical pathway of WNT signaling results in the nuclear accumulation
of β-catenin and transcriptional activation of target genes. WNT/β-catenin signaling plays a
role in ovarian tumorigenesis,7 as well as chemoresistance in cancer stem cells of all OvCa
subtypes.8 Our recent findings also suggest that the expression of WNT7A during the
malignant transformation of OvCa plays a critical role in tumor progression mediated by the
WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway.9
FGF1 is one of 23 members of the highly conserved polypeptide fibroblast growth factor
family. FGF1 has strong mitogenic effects on a variety of different cell types in various
stages of development, morphogenesis and angiogenesis in neoplastic or non-neoplastic
tissues.10, 11 FGF1 has been identified as a potential prognostic marker for OvCa.12 Genetic
variation of FGF1 has the most significant association with increased OvCa risk within the
FGF family.13 Furthermore, FGF1 expression is also a significant determinant of survival
and response to platinum-based chemotherapy.14 Thus, modulation of FGF1 by distinct
mechanisms in OvCa may be important in ovarian tumor progression.

Niclosamide is an efficacious and minimally toxic, FDA-approved drug for the treatment of
helminth parasites, specifically tapeworms, in humans. Several groups have reported that
niclosamide is active against cancer cells and targets WNT signaling.15–19 Niclosamide
inhibits solid tumor growth in a colon cancer model by promoting FZD endocytosis, leading
to the downregulation of DVL, β-catenin stabilization and TCF/LEF activity.17, 20
Niclosamide inhibits tumor growth by targeting S100A4, which is a transcriptional target of
WNT signaling,18 and by suppressing LRP6 in prostate and breast cancer cells.15 Given its
proven safety record and mechanisms that target WNT signaling raises the possibility of
repurposing niclosamide for OvCa treatment.

In the present study, we show that WNT7A and FGF1 expression are highly correlated in
ovarian carcinomas, and FGF1 is a direct transcriptional target of WNT7A/β-catenin
signaling. Niclosamide was an effective inhibitor of WNT7A/β-catenin signaling, including
FGF1 expression, and should be further explored as treatment for OvCa.

RESULTS
Analysis of FGF1 in OvCa

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

While analysis of FGF1 gene expression or variation has indicated an association with
OvCa risk,12–14 the expression pattern of FGF1 in ovarian cancer has not been
characterized. Therefore, immunoreactive FGF1 was examined using human OvCa tissues.
FGF1 was low in normal (Figure 1a) and benign (Figure 1b) ovary, as well as benign
fallopian tube epithelium (Figure 1c). FGF1 was highly detected in high grade invasive
serous epithelial carcinomas (Figure 1d, black arrows), and surface epithelial cells of low
grade serous carcinomas (Figure 1e, black arrows). Heterogeneous FGF1 was seen in the
tumor microenvironment, with lymphocytes positive in serous (Figure 1f), but not in
endometrioid carcinomas (Figure 1g). FGF1 was observed in fibroblasts of several
histotypes (Figure 1d, h, open white arrows). FGF1 was positive in clear cell carcinomas
(Figure 1h, black arrows). FGF1 was specifically detected in non-invasive cells lining the
basal membrane (Figure 1i, black arrows) and in the surface epithelial cells of mucinous
carcinomas (Figure 1j). Abundant FGF1 was also detected in epithelial fallopian tube
carcinomas (Figure 1k, black arrows). FGF1 was significantly higher in serous, clear cell,
mucinous and fallopian tube primary carcinomas compared to normal/benign ovarian and
fallopian tube tissues. Specifically, serous and fallopian tube carcinomas showed higher
levels of FGF1 than endometrioid carcinomas (Figure 1q). FGF1 was observed in metastases
from serous (Figure 1l, q), clear cell (Figure 1n, q), mucinous (Figure 1o, q) and fallopian
tube (Figure 1p, q) carcinomas, but not from endometrioid carcinomas (Figure 1m, q).
Correlation between WNT7A and FGF1 levels and overall survival

Author Manuscript

Since FGF family members have previously been identified as downstream targets of WNT
signaling,21 and a role for the specific ligand WNT7A was elucidated in tumor growth and
progression,9 we next examined whether WNT7A is associated with FGF1 in OvCa. A total
of 41 fresh-frozen ovarian samples including 5 normal/benign, 25 serous, 8 endometrioid, 3
clear cell and 0 mucinous were examined for WNT7A and FGF1 mRNA levels (Figure 2a).
The expression of WNT7A in serous carcinomas was correlated with high levels of FGF1
expression. Elevated WNT7A was correlated with moderately increased FGF1 levels in clear
cell carcinomas. Significantly higher WNT7A was observed in serous (1506-fold) and clear
cell (231-fold), but not in endometrioid carcinomas compared to normal/benign ovaries.
FGF1 transcripts were significantly higher (48-fold) in serous carcinomas compared to
normal/benign ovaries and slightly increased in clear cell carcinomas (6.26-fold), but
unchanged in endometrioid carcinomas.
Using previously generated cell lines,9 a correlation between FGF1 and WNT7A was
observed in cells with knockdown or overexpression of WNT7A, and in orthotopic tumors
that developed from these cells (Figure 2b). However, no other FGF family members, nor

FGF receptors, appeared to consistently follow WNT7A expression (Supplementary Figures
1 and 2). To further explore the correlation between WNT7A and FGF1 expression in OvCa,
we evaluated the prognostic and predictive impact of WNT7A and FGF1 using Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. A total of 961
primary ovarian tumors with completed data sets were selected for survival analysis. High
expression of both WNT7A and FGF1 was significantly correlated with poor survival as
determined by log-rank test (P=0.0304, Figure 2c). Furthermore, the 5-year (60 months)
survival rate was 34.2% in women with high WNT7A and FGF1 expressing tumors as
compared to 49.4% in women with low WNT7A and FGF1 expressing tumors. These
findings were similar to previously reported survival rates of advanced OvCa patients 5
years after initial diagnosis.22, 23
FGF1 is a direct transcriptional target of WNT7A/β-catenin signaling

Author Manuscript

To determine whether FGF1 is likely to be a direct rather than indirect β-catenin/TCF target
gene, we searched the FGF1 genomic locus and flanking DNA sequences for consensus
TCF/LEF-binding elements (WWCAAWG, W=A/T). We found several putative binding
sites at the 1A, 1B and 1C locus, but not at the 1D locus (Figure 3a). Therefore, we
performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using a TCF4 antibody to analyze
chromatin isolated from SKOV3.ip1, parental A2780 (lacking endogenous WNT7A), and
A2780 cells overexpressing WNT7A (Figure 3d). DNA from the anti-TCF4 ChIP of
SKOV3.ip1 was approximately 8-fold enriched in site 8, which contains the consensus
TCF4 binding site located in the 1C locus, when compared to IgG control. Interestingly, site
8 enrichment (5.5-fold) was observed in WNT7A overexpressing A2780 cells, but not in
control A2780 cells. TCF/LEF binding sites in the promoters of AXIN2 and SP5, wellknown direct β-catenin/TCF target genes, were used as positive controls. Irrelevant sites ~4
kb and ~500 kb downstream of the FGF1 locus (Non1 and Non2) and the RPL19 locus on a
different chromosome served as negative controls. Dominant negative (DN)-TCF4
expression in SKOV3.ip1 cells decreased FGF1, but not WNT7A levels (Supplementary
Figure 4a). Specifically, FGF-1C transcript expression was decreased in DN-TCF4
expressing cells (Supplementary Figure 4b), confirming the ChIP results in Figure 3d.
Collectively, these results suggest that at least one site within the FGF1 promoter is directly
regulated by WNT7A/β-catenin/TCF in OvCa.

The FGF1 gene is composed of a single protein isoform and has four alternative tissuespecific promoters subject to alternative splicing (Figure 3a).24, 25 Each promoter is coupled
with its 5′ untranslated exon, giving rise to four mRNAs with distinct UTRs, containing
exons 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D, respectively. Therefore, we examined specific FGF1 transcript(s)
in OvCa using 4 different forward primers designed in each untranslated exon and one
reverse primer designed in exon 1. SKOV3.ip1 cells, which express high endogenous
WNT7A and FGF1 (Supplementary Figure 3), show low or no expression of transcripts 1A,
1B or 1D, and high expression of the 1C transcript (12-fold higher than that of 1A and 1B
(Figure 3b)). The 1C transcript was reduced in WNT7A knockdown SKOV3.ip1 cells,
suggesting that 1C is specific to OvCa and possibly regulated by WNT7A. Similarly,
FGF1-1C was the most abundant transcript in human malignant ovarian tissues (Figure 3c).

WNT7A-FGF1 signaling promotes neoplastic transformation in OvCa

Author Manuscript

To understand whether FGF1 is necessary and/or sufficient for the effects of WNT7A in
OvCa tumor progression, we generated stable WNT7A or FGF1 overexpressing or
knockdown human OvCa cell lines (Supplementary Figure 5). Relative WNT7A and FGF1
expression in a panel of OvCa cell lines was determined (Supplementary Figure 3) and
A2780 cells were chosen for further analysis, as these cells have been widely used for gene
manipulation and xenograft study, and showed lack of or low endogenous WNT7A and
FGF1. The expression of FGF1 correlated with the upregulation of WNT7A in a genetically
manipulated A2780 line, whereas WNT7A expression was not induced by FGF1
overexpression. Therefore, stable FGF1 knockdown in WNT7A overexpressing cells and
their control cells were also generated.

Author Manuscript

Using these stable cell lines, we examined the in vitro effects of WNT7A and/or FGF1 on
cell proliferation and adhesion (Supplementary Figure 6), using these assays as indicators of
the roles of WNT7A and/or FGF1 in tumor growth in vivo. Cell doubling time was
significantly shorter and ability to adhere to plastic was significantly greater in WNT7A
overexpressing cells as compared to vector control cells. FGF1 overexpressing cells also
exhibited a significant increase in cell adhesion, but no obvious decrease in cell doubling
time was seen. However, FGF1 knockdown in WNT7A overexpressing cells showed that
the effect of WNT7A on cell doubling time and adhesion was attenuated in the absence of
FGF1.

Author Manuscript

Next, we examined the effects of WNT7A and/or FGF1 on tumor growth in vivo. Nude mice
were intraperitoneally inoculated with control, WNT7A overexpressing, or FGF1
overexpressing cells (n=6 each group, Figure 4a). After 5 weeks, a significant increase in
tumor burden, but not tumor number, was observed in mice injected with WNT7A or FGF1
overexpressing cells (1776.1 ± 555.3 mg or 1275.8 ± 396.2 mg, respectively compared to
pcDNA5, 151.8 ± 55.2 mg), suggesting that both WNT7A and FGF1 have potential roles in
tumor growth. The increased tumor growth by WNT7A overexpression was abrogated by
inhibiting FGF1 (n=6 each group, Figure 4b), confirming that FGF1 is downstream of
WNT7A signaling in OvCa cells. FGF1 knockdown in WNT7A overexpressing cells
resulted in reduced tumor burden (265.3 ± 106.5 mg) compared to mice injected with cells
overexpressing WNT7A and control shRNA (1372.8 ± 474.4 mg). We confirmed that
expression of WNT7A and FGF1 was maintained in orthotopic tumors.
Niclosamide can inhibit WNT7A/β-catenin signaling in OvCa

Author Manuscript

Several WNT inhibitors have been found to effectively block WNT signaling.26–29 To
determine whether WNT7A/β-catenin signaling could be a therapeutic target in the context
of OvCa treatment, we searched the LOPAC library containing 1280 pharmacological active
compounds (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to find compounds inhibiting WNT
signaling. A total of 14 small molecules were selected to determine WNT7A/β-catenin
inhibitory activity in OvCa cell lines (Supplementary Figure 7a). Half of the small
molecules significantly inhibited the activity of the TCF/LEF luciferase reporter in A2780
cells stimulated by WNT7A. Niclosamide exhibited the most significant inhibitory effect on
WNT7A/β-catenin signaling. Thus, we chose to focus on niclosamide for further study.

Next, we assessed the molecular targets of niclosamide within the WNT/β-catenin signaling
pathway in OvCa cells (Supplementary Figure 7bcd). Our results indicated potential
regulation of WNT7A production, as niclosamide dose-dependently inhibited WNT7A
levels. TCF/LEF reporter activity in cells stimulated by exogenous (A2780) or endogenous
(SKOV3.ip1) WNT7A was suppressed by niclosamide. We also confirmed that niclosamide
inhibited TCF/LEF activity stimulated by a constitutively active β-catenin (S33Y).
Niclosamide regulates OvCa cell functions and inhibits tumor growth and progression

Author Manuscript

To determine whether niclosamide has therapeutic potential in OvCa, control and WNT7A
knockdown SKOV3.ip1 cells 9 were used to assess cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
migration (Figure 5). Niclosamide dose-dependently decreased cell number in SKOV3.ip1
cells, whereas cells depleted of WNT7A were less sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects
of niclosamide (IC50=1.2 or 9.8 μM in SKOV3.ip1 or WNT7A knockdown cells,
respectively, Figure 5a). Similarly, cleaved-caspase 3 was increased up to 2.7-fold by
treatment with 10 μM niclosamide in SKOV3.ip1 cells, while WNT7A knockdown cells
were less sensitive to this effect (Figure 5b). This result was confirmed by immunoblot
analysis, showing that niclosamide increased cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, and decreased
total caspase-3 and PARP. Niclosamide inhibited invasive features in SKOV3.ip1 cells
(Figure 5c). It is well known that the SKOV3.ip1 cells primarily contain CDH1 (E-cadherin)
negative cells. Our results showed that niclosamide dose-dependently increased CDH1 and
decreased its transcriptional repressor SLUG in SKOV3.ip1, while niclosamide did not
affect CDH1 and SLUG in WNT7A knockdown cells. Consistent with these results,
migration was inhibited in WNT7A knockdown cells, and was dose-dependently decreased
by niclosamide in parental SKOV3.ip1 cells.

Author Manuscript

We next determined the effect of niclosamide on ovarian tumor growth and progression
(Figure 6). Five weeks after injection with SKOV3.ip1 cells, mice that received vehicle
treatment (n=6) developed disseminated abdominal disease mimicking OvCa in patients.
Niclosamide treated mice (n=6) had significantly fewer implants on the mesentery and
intraperitoneal region (13.8 ± 2.0 vs 78.5 ± 8.7 implants) and their total tumor weight was
172 ± 30 mg vs 936 ± 121 mg. Decreased tumor cell proliferation, as determined by Ki67
immunohistochemistry, was correlated with tumor growth and quantitatively significant.
TUNEL analysis revealed a significant number of apoptotic cells in the tumors of mice
treated with niclosamide.

Author Manuscript

While niclosamide reduced FGF1 expression in SKOV3.ip1 cells, FGF1 itself did not
influence the efficacy of niclosamide (Supplementary Figure 8). When FGF1 only was
overexpressed in A2780 cells, no differences in cell viability or death were observed
compared to control following niclosamide exposure, whereas cells overexpressing WNT7A
were more sensitive to the effects of niclosamide. Moreover, WNT7A overexpressing cells
with and without FGF1 knockdown were equally sensitive to the effects of niclosamide,
suggesting that niclosamide targets WNT7A/β-catenin rather than FGF1 directly. However,
because FGF1 is a downstream target of aberrant WNT7A/β-catenin signaling and abundant
WNT7A and FGF1 are observed in ovarian cancer, indirect downregulation of FGF1 by
niclosamide remains clinically relevant.

DISCUSSION
FGF1 has been identified as an adverse prognostic factor in OvCa risk.12–14 In the present
study, we show that FGF1 is a downstream target of WNT7A signaling via β-catenin
activation. First, FGF1 is abundant in OvCa, correlates with high WNT7A, especially in
serous carcinomas. High expression of both WNT7A and FGF1 is associated with poor
survival (Figures 1 and 2). Second, the FGF1 gene is directly regulated by WNT7A/βcatenin signaling (Figure 3). Third, FGF1 is sufficient to drive the tumor promoting effects
of WNT7A (Figure 4).

Author Manuscript

Our previous study demonstrated that WNT7A is the sole ligand activating β-catenin/TCF
signaling in OvCa.9 We found that the FGF1-1C transcript is specifically regulated in a
WNT7A and β-catenin/TCF-dependent manner in OvCa. The ChIP analysis indicates that a
single consensus TCF/LEF binding site at the 1C promoter locus is critical for WNT7Amediated TCF binding, while binding sites within the 1A and 1B loci are not occupied in the
context of WNT7A. It has been reported that 1C and 1D transcripts are potential markers for
cell proliferation, while 1A and 1B are specific for the maintenance and survival of cells.24
Although FGF1-1C specific functions in OvCa pathogenesis have yet to be determined,
FGF1-1C is directly transcribed from activation of β-catenin/TCF signaling stimulated by
WNT7A.

Author Manuscript

FGF1 binds receptors of FGFR1, 2, 3 and 4 with high-affinity.11 Two receptors, FGFR2IIIb
and FGFR4 have been implicated in OvCa progression,30, 31 and FGFR4 has been identified
as a potential therapeutic target in OvCa.31 Several studies have reported that other members
of the FGF family are WNT/β-catenin target genes. FGF9 and FGF20 are indirect and/or
direct transcriptional targets of β-catenin/TCF signaling in endometrioid OvCa, in which the
WNT pathway is often constitutively activated, usually via missense mutation of
CTNNB1.21, 32 However, no members of the FGF family or the FGF receptors, other than
FGF1, have been correlated with WNT7A expression in OvCa and none were directly
regulated by WNT7A in our model. These results suggest that FGF1 is an important
mediator of the tumor promoting events of WNT7A-dependent pathogenesis.

Author Manuscript

The importance of inappropriate WNT signaling for the development and progression of
many cancers, including OvCa, has been well documented.7–9 Therefore, it is plausible to
search for therapeutic drugs that target the WNT7A/β-catenin-FGF1 pathway. While several
small molecules that target this pathway have been identified33 and, for a few of them, a
precise mechanism of inhibition has been determined,27, 33, 34 niclosamide was selected as
the most efficient inhibitor of WNT7A-dependent TCF/LEF reporter activity. Niclosamide
has recently been identified to target stem-like OvCa-initiating cells by a drug screening
method, and gene expression array indicated involvement of WNT hyperactivity.35 In the
present study, we found that niclosamide could directly target β-catenin-TCF/LEF
transcriptional activity, specifically; the effects of niclosamide on cell functions are more
robust in WNT7A overexpressing cells. Our results also revealed that niclosamide reduced
tumor growth and progression. We show that WNT7A is highest in serous carcinomas, the
most common OvCa subtype,9 and recent studies suggest niclosamide is effective in OvCa
stem cells.35 While the importance of WNT7A in OvCa stem cells is not known, WNT7A is

one of the critical factors determining cell fate in female reproductive development.36, 37
The regulation of WNT7A in OvCa may lead us to understand the etiology and/or function of
stem cells in aggressive serous carcinomas.

Author Manuscript

Although our results demonstrated that niclosamide efficacy in OvCa depended on WNT7A,
but not FGF1 function, other signaling pathways could be additional targets. Niclosamide is
reported to target not only WNT signaling but also mTORC1, STAT3 and NFκB pathways
in several cancers.38–42 Furthermore, we showed that niclosamide increased E-cadherin and
decreased SLUG proteins. E-cadherin establishes cell polarity, mediates inhibition of
proliferation and inhibits tumor cell growth.43, 44 E-cadherin is often downregulated during
tumor progression, leading to increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis.45, 46 Therefore,
it is likely that niclosamide reduces invasive and aggressive features in OvCa. While the
potential interaction between these cascades and WNT signaling is an intriguing area for
future study, overall niclosamide has broad potential as an effective inhibitor to treat OvCa
patients.
In the present study, we determined that WNT7A-FGF1 signaling is capable of inducing
tumor growth, indicating a critical role in the aggressive progression of OvCa. Furthermore,
we found that niclosamide is an effective therapeutic inhibitor of WNT7A/β-catenin
signaling. New drugs are desperately needed to treat OvCa, and niclosamide is FDAapproved with a favorable safety profile. If niclosamide continues to hold promise in further
pre-clinical studies, repurposing may ultimately prove to have a tremendous impact on the
lives of OvCa patients in the clinical setting.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunolocalization of FGF1 in a total of 537 human specimens including 10 normal/benign
(8 ovaries and 2 fallopian tubes), 147 serous, 20 endometrioid, 22 clear cell, 7 mucinous and
32 fallopian tube primary tumors, and 299 metastases from 199 serous, 8 endometrioid, 15
clear cell, 4 mucinous and 73 fallopian tube tumors; and Ki67 in xenografts from nude mice
were examined in cross-sections (5 μm) of paraffin-embedded tissue sections using specific
primary antibodies and a Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA,

Cell proliferation, adhesion and migration

Author Manuscript

Cell proliferation, adhesion and migration assays were performed following our previously
described methods.9, 48 To assess cell proliferation, cells (2×104/well) were seeded in 24well plates. Doubling time of cells was calculated from the growth rate during the
exponential growth phase (0–72 h) using the formula, Td = 0.693t/ln(Nt/N0), where t is time
in days, Nt is cell number at time t, and N0 is cell number at the initial time.49, 50 To
determine the effect of niclosamide on cell viability, cells were treated with vehicle (0.1%
DMSO) or niclosamide (0–10 μM) for 48 hours before being harvested and counted by
trypan blue exclusion. To assess cell adhesion, cells (1×105/well) were seeded in 24-well
plates and harvested after 1 h incubation. Cell migration assays were performed using a
modified Boyden Chamber method with 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane 24-well
transwells. Cells were treated with vehicle or niclosamide for 24 hours before being
harvested, re-plated (75×103 cells per well in 100 μl of serum-free medium) into upper
wells, and placed in lower wells containing 500 μl serum-free medium in order to determine
unstimulated migratory ability.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
ChIP assays were performed using the Magna ChIP G-chromatin immunoprecipitation Kit
(Thermo Scientific) as described previously.51 Sheared chromatin from 1×106 cells was
immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal TCF4 antibody or control mouse IgG (Thermo
Scientific). Primers for the qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

Animal experiments
For in vivo animal studies, 7–8 week-old female nude mice (nu/nu BALB/c, Jackson
Laboratories) were injected with 1×106 cells i.p. in a total volume of 400 μl. Body weights
were monitored every 7 days thereafter. Mice were euthanized and necropsied 5 weeks after
injection. Niclosamide (200 mg/kg B.W.) or vehicle control (PEG400) was given daily by
oral gavage for 5 weeks. Harvested tumors were either frozen or fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for further analysis.
Statistical analyses

Author Manuscript

Quantitative data were subjected to least-squares ANOVA and differences between
individual means were tested by a Tukey multiple-range test using Prism 4.0 (Graphpad, San
Diego, CA, USA). QPCR data were corrected for differences in sample loading using the
RPL19 data as a covariate. Tests of significance were performed using the appropriate error
terms according to the expectation of the mean squares for error. A p-value of 0.05 or less
was considered significant. Data are presented as least-square means (LSM) with standard
error of the means (SEM). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the survival
rates and was evaluated by the log-rank test using GEO and TCGA datasets: GSE9891,52
GSE14764,53 GSE2671254 and TCGA-OV, that contained 285, 80, 195 and 570 samples of
normal and cancerous ovary, peripheral tissues and fallopian tubes, respectively. A total of
