Abstract
The effective induction of p21WAF1/CIP1/Cdkn1a (p21) expression in p53-negative cancer cells is an important
avenue in cancer management. We investigated the ability of various common chemotherapeutic drugs to
induce p21 expression in p53-negative cancer cells and showed that the induction of p21 expression by
oxaliplatin is caused by the derepression of a previously unrecognized negative regulatory element with a
Sp1/Sp3 palindrome sequence core at 216 to 236 of the p21 proximal promoter. Electrophoretic mobility
shift and antibody super-shift assays conﬁrmed the speciﬁc binding of Sp1/Sp3, and showed that the
oxaliplatin-mediated derepression of p21 transcription was associated with an increased Sp1/Sp3 phosphorylation and binding afﬁnity to the oxaliplatin-responsive element. A search of the ENCODE database for
vertebrate-conserved genomic elements identiﬁed the Sp1/Sp3 palindrome element as the only vertebrateconserved element within the 500-bp proximal p21 promoter region, indicating its fundamental importance.
In in vivo competition assays, transfected synthetic Sp1/Sp3 palindrome elements derepressed the cotransfected or endogenous p21 promoter in a dosage-dependent manner. This derepression was not seen in
oxaliplatin-treated cells, suggesting that the exogenous Sp1/Sp3 palindrome and oxaliplatin had the same
downstream signaling target. Taken together, our results revealed, for the ﬁrst time, this evolutionarily
conserved Sp1/Sp3 palindrome element in the proximal p21 promoter that serves as a regulatory repressor to
maintain p21 basal level expression. Cancer Res; 72(23); 6236–46. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
WAF1/CIP1

The tumor suppression function of p21
(CDKN1,
p21) has been shown not only in mouse models of p21
deﬁciency (1–3) but also in human cancers under certain
conditions (4–6). However, the expression of p21 is often
repressed in p53-negative cancer cells and the identiﬁcation
of chemotherapeutic drugs that effectively induce p21 expression in p53-negative cancer cells represents an important
element in cancer management (4, 7–8). p21 expression is
primarily regulated at the transcriptional level with p53-dependent and -independent activation. Both regulatory pathways
are critical in cellular housekeeping and environmental
response and are expected to be conserved during evolution
(9, 10). Therefore, promoter–reporter assays are broadly
accepted as an indication of p21 expression and are used to
identify responsive cis-elements for mechanism studies.
Indeed, p53 activates p21 transcription through 2 conserved

p53-responsive elements on the p21 promoter (11–13). p53independent p21 regulation is achieved through various transcription factors, including Sp1/Sp3, located in the well-studied p21 proximal promoter region. Sp1/Sp3 is a potent activator for the p21 promoter activity, and the 6 classic binding
sites within the 119 to 50 bp on the p21 promoter have been
found to be responsive to transcriptional activation or repression effects of various agents (13).
To complement experimental assays that identify speciﬁc
functional elements, the functional signiﬁcance of regulatory
sequences are often further assessed by examining evolutionary conservation across multiple species, because the
existence of consensus protein factor-binding sequences
may not indicate functional promoter sequences and many
of these predicted sites do not have function in vivo (14–16).
Although the evolutionarily conserved sequences may not
fully overlap with experimentally identiﬁed functional elements, the existence of highly conserved sequences within
an experimentally identiﬁed functional element suggests
that its fundamental functions are under evolutionary constraint (17). In addition, many of the bona ﬁde functional
elements may not show up in the conservation map because
of the limitation in calculation methods and species/functional speciﬁcity (18–20).
Further conﬁrmation of the functional element is usually
done by more precise experimental methods including
single nucleotide mutations in various testing systems
(21, 22).

Conserved Drug-Responsive Element of p21 Promoter

Here, we report the effective induction of p21 expression by
oxaliplatin, a third-generation platinum therapeutic anticancer drug, through a previously unrecognized and evolutionarily
conserved Sp1/Sp3 binding palindrome element, located
between 216 and 236 bp, further upstream of the 6 known
Sp1/Sp3 sites, in a p53-negative human ovarian cancer cell line
by transcriptional derepression. The functional signiﬁcance of
this Sp1/Sp3 palindrome element is assessed by evolutionary
conservation analysis and conﬁrmed by in vivo competition
assays.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Oxaliplatin, hydroxyurea, and cytosine arabinoside were
purchased from Sigma. 5-Fluorouracil and doxorubicin were
the gifts from the Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry. Antibodies to p21, Sp1, and HDAC1 were purchased from
Cell Signaling. Antibodies to Sp3, Zic2, Rb, pRb, and b-actin
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Creation of p21 promoter–reporter constructs
The p21-luciferase (pFL-luc) construct is a gift from Dr.
Thomas Benjamin, Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA). The
deletion panel pFL-D1 to pFL-D9 was constructed using KODplus-Mutagenesis Kit (Toyobo). The sequences of mutagenesis
primers are pFL-D1: 50 -AGGGTATGTGATCTGCCAGCAGATC30 and 50 -AGCTTATCGATACCGTCGACCTCG-30 ; pFL-D2: 50 CTGAAAGCAGAGGGGCTTCAAGG-30 and 50 -CAAGGACAAAATAGCCACCAGCCTC-30 ; pFL-D3: 50 -TTTCTGTGTCTGTCAGAAGAACCAG-30 and 50 -GACATTGTCTGTCTGTTTACTTTGG-30 ; pFL-D4: 50 -AGATCAGGTTGCCCTTTTTTGGTAG-30
and 50 -TGCTTTTAAAAAATTGCAGAGGATG-30 ; pFL-D5: 50 AACAGTGCTGTGTCCTCCTGGAGAG-30 and 50 -ACCTGAACAGAAGAAATCCCTGTGG-30 pFL-D6: 50 -GCACGCGAGGTTCCGGGACCG-30 and 50 -AGAATGAGCCCCCTTTCTGGCTCAC30 ; pFL-D7: 50 -TGGAGAGTGCCAACTCATTCTCCAAG-30 and
50 - GTTAGAATGAGCCCCCTTTCTGGCTCAC-30 ; pFL-D8: 50 GTGGGGAAATGTGTCCAGCGCAC-30 and 50 -TTTTACTTGGAGAATGAGTTGGCACTC-30 ; pFL-D9: 50 -TGCAGCACGCGAGGTTCC-30 and 50 - CCAGTCCCTCGCCTGCGTTGG-30 . To
generate pFL-GCrich, pFL-luc was digested with NheI and
PstI, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and religated. The
pGL3ctrlDEnh construct was generated from pGL3-Control
(Promega) with its enhancer deleted. To create pGL3ctrlDEnh141, the fragment between 212 and 352 of the p21 promoter
was ampliﬁed and cloned into the SmaI site of pGL3ctrlDEnh.
pGL3ctrlDEnh-2F3 was created by ﬁrst synthesizing complementary oligonucleotides representing the sequences in the
p21 promoter between bases 213 and 242. These oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the SmaI site of
pGL3ctrlDEnh.
Cell culture and transfection
SKOV3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. The cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma
contamination using 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
staining and, for p53 and p21 expression status, by Western
blots; however, they were not speciﬁcally authenticated. Trans-

fection was carried out using PEI (Polysciences, Inc.) according
to Cellntec's protocol with modiﬁcations. A 2-mg reporter
plasmid with 0.2 mg of pRL-TK (Promega) or 0.1 mg of
pCMV-b-gal (Clontech) served as an internal control, with
constant total amount of DNA adjusted with pGEX-4T1 (Promega). Between 4 and 6 hours after transfection, cells were
incubated in fresh Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(DMEM) for 16 hours, and then exposed to 100 mmol/L
oxaliplatin for 24 hours and were assayed for luciferase activity
using the Dual-Luciferase assay System (Promega). b-Gal
activity was measured by the b-Galactosidase Assay Kit (Stratagene). For pCMV-p53 and pFL-luc or pFL-D9 co-transfection,
1 mg of pFL-luc or pFL-D9, 0.1 mg of pCMV-p53, and 0.2 mg of
pRL-TK were used as an internal control. For oligonucleotide in
vivo competition assay, complementary oligonucleotides were
synthesized and annealed before use. For each well of a 6-well
plate, 1 mg of pFL-luc reporter plasmid, 0.2 mg of pRL-TK as the
internal control, and 0.2 pmol or 2 pmol oligonucleotides were
used.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR
Oxaliplatin-treated or untreated SKOV3 cells were used for
total RNA extraction using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms
of total RNA was converted into cDNA by reverse transcriptase
(Takara) according to the manufacturer's protocol and used for
p21 and GAPDH cDNA ampliﬁcation. The primers for p21 and
GAPDH were: 50 -TCACTGTCTTGTACCCTTGTGC-30 and 50 ACTGAGACTAAGGCAGAAGATGTAGAG-30 for p21 and 50 AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTG-30 and 50 -AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC-30 for GAPDH. PCR was conducted as follows:
denaturation at 95 C for 3 minutes and ampliﬁcation cycle
number for up to 26 cycles (for GAPDH) or 34 cycles (for p21) at
95 C for 30 seconds, 58 C for 30 seconds, and 72 C for 30
seconds. The ampliﬁed products from various cycle numbers
were separated on 2% agarose gels and quantiﬁed.
Western blot analysis
Cells or pieces of xenograft tumors were lysed in NP40 lysis
buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (EMD Biosciences). For
alkaline phosphatase treatment, cell extracts were incubated
with 10 U of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP; Invitrogen) and 10 mmol/L MgCl2 for 30 minutes at 37 C. Proteins
were separated by 10% [acrylamide (A):bisacrylamide (B) ¼
72:1] or 10% or 12% (A:B ¼ 30:1) SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane (PALL) for
antibody detection.
Immunoﬂuorescence studies
SKOV3 cells grown on coverslips were ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature and blocked with
goat serum (5% in 1  PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 minutes.
Coverslips were incubated with appropriate antibody for 2
hours and then for 1 hour with secondary antibody conjugated
with Dylight594 or Dylight488 (MultiSciences Biotech). Nuclei
were counterstained by DAPI (Invitrogen). For biotin-labeled
oligonucleotides, transfected cells were detected with streptavidin conjugated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC).

Nuclear extracts
Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were isolated from
SKOV3 cells using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic isolation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were conducted using Lightshift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Thermo
Scientiﬁc) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were analyzed on the BD LSRFortessa ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. Cell-cycle proﬁles were evaluated using Modiﬁt
3.0.
Xenograft tumor growth assays
SKOV3 cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in
PBS at 2  107 cells/mL. A dose of 100 mL cells were injected
subcutaneously into 4- to 6-week-old BALB/c athymic nude
mice. Mice were examined every 4 days until visible tumors
appeared. Subsequently, tumor volume measurements were
taken every 3 to 4 days. Tumor volume was calculated by the
formula: 1/2 (length  width2). The tumors were harvested

after 36 hours of the ﬁnal administration for Western blot
analysis.

Results
Induction of p21 expression in p53-negative SKOV3 cells
is positively related to chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy
We previously reported that the induction of p21 played a
major role in suppressing tumorigenicity of p53-negative
SKOV3 cells by SalL2 (23). We, therefore, tested whether the
induction of p21 expression by common chemotherapy agents
was positively related to efﬁcacy in reducing tumorigenicity in
these cells. Among the 6 chemotherapeutic drugs tested,
oxaliplatin, a DNA alkylation agent, showed effective transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter compared with other
drugs such as doxorubicin (Fig. 1A). The expression level of p21
mRNA was measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR; Fig. 1B), and a signiﬁcant increase in p21
mRNA level was detected after oxaliplatin treatment. In addition, both Western blot (Fig. 1C) and immunoﬂuorescent
staining (Fig. 1D) conﬁrmed the induction of p21 protein after
oxaliplatin treatment. The induction of p21 protein coincided
with the repression of phosphorylated Rb (p-Rb), indicating
reduced cell-cycle progression after oxaliplatin treatment in a
dosage-dependent manner, but no signiﬁcant change in HDAC

(HU, 10 mg/mL), oxaliplatin (Oxa, 100 mmol/L), and doxorubicin (Doxo, 0.2 mg/mL) for 24 hours. Data are shown as mean  SD (n ¼ 3;    ,P < 0.001, t-test).

control. C, representative Western blots showed p21, Rb, inactivated Rb (p-Rb), and HDAC1 levels in SKOV3 cells after treatment with oxaliplatin. D,

levels were seen, indicating this induction of p21 was not
through a decreased total HDAC level (Fig. 1C).
Flow cytometric analysis of oxaliplatin-treated cells
showed a marked S-phase blockage of the cell cycle consistent with DNA synthesis inhibition (Fig. 2A and 2B). Further
testing in a nude mice xenograft model conﬁrmed the
effective suppression of SKOV3 tumor by oxaliplatin compared with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin, an
ineffective p21 inducer (Fig. 2C and D). To verify the induction of p21 expression by oxaliplatin in xenograft tumors,
cell extracts from xenograft tumors were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2E). Data from the Western blot analysis were
quantiﬁed and showed a signiﬁcant induction of p21 expression in oxaliplatin-treated tumors compared with untreated
control and doxorubicin-treated tumors. These results were
consistent with the notion that the ability to induce p21
expression in p53-negative cancer cells is positively related
to the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs in treating
p53-negative tumors.
A vertebrate-conserved Sp1/Sp3 palindrome sequence is
the derepression target for the induction of the p21
promoter by oxaliplatin
There are abundant reports about p21 regulation (for a
review, see refs. 10, 24), but the mechanisms of p21 induction

www.aacrjournals.org

by chemotherapeutic drugs are still not fully understood. To
investigate the mechanism of oxaliplatin activation of the p21
promoter, we generated a series of scanning deletions using a
parental p21 promoter (2601 to þ51) linked with a luciferase
reporter and tested their inducibility by oxaliplatin treatment
(Fig. 3A and B). A promoter region between 353 and 211
(Fig. 3A; pFL-D6) was identiﬁed to be essential because deletion
of this fragment abolished the oxaliplatin induction. A comparison of results between pFL-D6 and full-length construct
pFL-Luc (Fig. 3A and B) revealed that the induction was largely
achieved through derepression rather than activation, as the
deletion of this region increased the promoter activity to a
similar level of drug induction compared with controls that
retained this region.
Further analysis of the region of 353 to 211 identiﬁed
several potential transcription factor-binding sites that separated this region into 3 fragments. Fragment 1 included a
NF-E2/AP1 site; fragment2, a TGF-b and an NF-E2 site; and
fragment3, a Zic1/Zic2 site and 2 inverted Sp1/Sp3 sites
forming a palindrome (Fig. 3A; bottom). Further promoter–
reporter analysis by deleting these fragments separately
indicated that fragment3 was critical for oxaliplatin derepression (Fig. 3B). To determine whether this fragment was
able to conduct oxaliplatin responsiveness independent of
its surrounding sequence context on a heterogeneous

research consortium ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements), which was speciﬁcally designed for the identiﬁcation
and analysis of functional DNA elements in the human genome

3 potential transcription factor binding regions (for fragment
sequences, see Fig. 3A and 3B) were used with nuclear extracts
from control and oxaliplatin-treated SKOV3 cells in EMSA.
Only F3 showed strong band shift with both control and
oxaliplatin-treated cell extracts (Fig. 4A). Antibody super-shift
assay identiﬁed the major binding factors on the top and
bottom bands as Sp1 and Sp3, respectively, but not Zic2, a
transcription factor also with a potential binding site in F3 (Fig.
4B and 4C). However, Sp1 and Sp3 showed little change in the
protein level or subcellular localization before and after oxaliplatin treatment (Fig. 4D and 4E). However, we did notice a
slightly reduced mobility of Sp1 band in Western blot after
oxaliplatin treatment (Fig. 4E) and, therefore, further analyzed
the Sp1 status by Western blotting. SKOV3 cells were treated
with or without 100 mmol/L oxaliplatin for 24 hours, and cell
extracts were used directly or treated with CIAP before Western blotting by antibody against Sp1 (Fig. 4F). Two distinct Sp1
bands were apparent in this blot where the top band is induced
by oxaliplatin treatment, and were conﬁrmed to be the phosphorylated Sp1 because treatment by CIAP removed most of it.
Oxaliplatin promoted an increased afﬁnity for Sp1/Sp3
binding to the conserved element while the 50 Sp1/Sp3
binding site of the palindrome was necessary for binding
efﬁciency
To characterize and delineate the effect of oxaliplatininduced phosphorylation on the binding of Sp1/Sp3 on the

6242

Cancer Res; 72(23) December 1, 2012

oxaliplatin-responsive element, we examined the binding afﬁnity of Sp1/Sp3 through a combination of super-shift and
competition assays (Fig. 5A–D), as well as mutation shift
analysis (Fig. 5E–G). Both unlabeled F3 and a Sp1/Sp3 consensus fragment competed with the labeled F3 sequence in a
dosage-dependent manner for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp1 super-shift
bands in both control and oxaliplatin-treated samples, thus
conﬁrming that the primary binding factors were Sp1 and Sp3
(Fig. 5A). However, comparison of the Sp1 and Sp3 shifts with
and without oxaliplatin treatment (Fig. 5C and 5D) revealed
markedly reduced competition efﬁciency for both unlabeled
Sp1/Sp3 consensus sequence and unlabeled F3, indicating
tighter binding of Sp1 and Sp3 protein to F3 after the drug
treatment.
There are 2 potential Sp1/Sp3 binding sites on the oxaliplatin-responsive element, with one forward sequence and the
other reverse forming a palindrome overlapping the vertebrate-conserved region (Fig. 5E). Four mutation sequences that
disrupt each or all Sp1/Sp3 binding sites within the conserved
region of the palindrome were synthesized and tested for Sp1/
Sp3 binding. Disruption of the 50 -most string of Gs in the
palindrome had the most impact on the binding efﬁciency,
whereas disruption of the 30 Gs had minimal effect for binding.
However, none of these single mutants completely abolished
Sp1/Sp3 binding unless all 3 sites were mutated simultaneously

Conserved Drug-Responsive Element of p21 Promoter

Sp1/Sp3 binding while the 30 half of the palindrome might also
play a minor role, correlating well with the position of the
conserved core sequence.
In vivo competition of Sp1/Sp3 palindrome element
activated p21 expression without oxaliplatin treatment
Our results showed that the oxaliplatin-responsive element was not functional on a chimeric SV40 promoter
(see Fig. 3) and the binding of Sp1/Sp3 could be competed
off with unlabeled fragment. We transfected free F3 in the
form of annealed double-stranded DNA to speciﬁcally compete in vivo for the inhibitory factor(s) recruited by Sp1/Sp3
with the same sequence located on cotransfected p21 promoter-luciferase reporter gene or with that of the endogenous p21 gene (Fig. 6). Transfection with free F3, but not
with nearby sequences F1 or F2, induced a derepression in
cells without oxaliplatin treatment (Fig. 6A, left) but not in
oxaliplatin-treated cells (Fig. 6A, right). In addition, cotransfected MU4, an F3 mutant deﬁcient in binding Sp1/Sp3, as
well as the Sp1 consensus oligo, did not activate the p21
promoter (Fig. 6B), indicating promoter activation by F3 is
sequence-speciﬁc and treatment status–speciﬁc. Immunoﬂuorescent staining of cells transfected with either F3 or F1
showed the induction of endogenous p21 gene expression
with F3 but not F1 (Fig. 6C). These results further conﬁrmed
that the repressor function of this oxaliplatin-responsive
element of the p21 promoter is general and independent
of drug treatment.
To determine whether the conserved oxaliplatin-responsive
element also functions in p53-dependent transcriptional reg-

ulation, we cotransfected a p53 expression construct and p21
promoter constructs to SKOV3 cells (Fig. 7A). Luciferase assay
results showed a great increase in p53-dependent p21 transcription that is dominant but additive to the derepression by
oxaliplatin. Therefore, p53-induced activation of p21 promoter
seems independent of p21 basal level derepression by oxaliplatin. Western blot analysis revealed a similar trend of independent induction of p21 by p53 from p21 basal level; the p53
effect is additive to oxaliplatin treatment at protein level
compared with oxaliplatin treatment alone (Fig. 7B). The
general location and the conserved regions are shown
in Fig. 7C.

Discussion
To investigate whether the ability of therapeutic drugs to
induce p21 expression in p53-negative cells is positively related
to the efﬁcacy in suppressing p53-negative tumors, we revealed
a previously unreported and evolutionarily conserved oxaliplatin-responsive element. This element contains a Sp1/Sp3
palindrome and is necessary for p53-independent derepression
by oxaliplatin and necessary for basal level transcriptional
repression of p21 promoter. The conserved element responsive
to derepression by oxaliplatin was also functional with similar
chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin (data not shown).
The regulation of the p21 promoter through Sp1/Sp3 binding sites is well documented (26, 29). There are 6 known Sp1/
Sp3 sites within the 119 bp proximal promoter that generally
enhance p21 expression (for a review, see ref. 9). Our results,
however, did not show a signiﬁcant oxaliplatin-induced change
in Sp1 level or the amount of Sp1 binding to the oxaliplatin-

Increasing amount of endlabeled DNA fragments were cotransfected with pFL-luc in SKOV3 cells. Oxaliplatin (100 mmol/L, right) or control blank (left) treatment was done 16 hours
after transfection. Luciferase activity was analyzed 24 hours after treatment and normalized to pFL-luc transfection alone (blank). B, transfection was
conducted as in A using the indicated unlabeled DNA probes. Forty hours after transfection, luciferase activities were measured and normalized to pFL-luc

SKOV3 cells were transfected without (blank) or with 2 pmol biotin-labeled F1 or F3. The transfected biotin end-labeled fragments were stained by
FITC–streptavidin (green) and p21 was detected by p21 antibody (red). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).

Figure 7. A, p53-dependent transcription of p21 was independent of oxaliplatin derepression mediated through the conserved element. SKOV3 cells were
cotransfected with pCMV-p53 (p53) and pFL-luc or pFL-D9 and treated with or without 100 mmol/L oxaliplatin for 24 hours. Luciferase activities were
assayed as indicated. Data are shown as mean  SD (n ¼ 5;  , P < 0.05; t test). B, Western blot analysis of vehicle and p53-transfected SKOV3 cells with

responsive element other than binding afﬁnity changes. However, an induction of Sp1 phosphorylation by oxaliplatin was
clear (Fig. 4F). Sp1/Sp3 mediates the regulation of a host of
genes involved in the response to cellular conditions that
require upregulation of one set of genes while repression of
others. Therefore, modiﬁcation, but not the amount of Sp1/
Sp3, is often the case in responding to changing signals (33).
Hyperphosphorylation has been reported in DNA damage by
radiation and hydroxyl urea (33, 34), but phosphorylation of
Sp1 by oxaliplatin has not been reported.
We showed in Fig. 3C that the function of fragment 3 is
content/position-dependent. This was not a surprise because
Sp1/Sp3 sites are common near the transcription initiation
complex and are regarded as the binding bases of various
transcriptional regulatory cofactors (33). These sites are often
position-dependent for complex transcriptional regulation
that requires proper interactions with nearby transcription
factors recruited to the transcriptional initiation sites (29, 35).
We speculate that the general repression by fragment3 is the
result of both a unique Sp1/Sp3-binding sequence that recruits
corepressors, such as HDAC, and the unique location that
enables the recruited cosuppressors to interact with and to

6244

suppress a cluster of downstream Sp1/Sp3 sites of the p21
promoter, consistent with known mechanisms of Sp1/Sp3mediated transcriptional repression (29, 35–37).
The signiﬁcance of the Sp1/Sp3 palindrome element was
further revealed by analyzing the 2.6-kb p21 promoter for
cross-species conservation to identify functional promoter
elements (17, 38; Fig. 3 and Fig. 7). Experimentally identiﬁed
F3 fragment containing the Sp1/Sp3 palindrome element is
well conserved in mammals and vertebrates with a log-odds
(LOD) score of 16 (Fig. 7), same as that of the 2 p53 binding
sequences (Fig. 7). In comparison, all 6 Sp1/Sp3 sites in the
proximal promoter region have little conservation. These
results indicate a fundamental function, such as the maintenance of a basal level expression for the Sp1/Sp3 palindrome
element that is under strong evolutionary pressure, whereas
the other Sp1/Sp3 sites may play more species-speciﬁc or
redundant roles in various species.
As a regulatory factor-interacting base and recruiter, Sp1
both positively and negatively regulates genes through
changing afﬁnity for these cofactors by posttranslational
modiﬁcation in response to environmental signals, including
iron deprivation (39) and DNA damage (34). We investigated

Conserved Drug-Responsive Element of p21 Promoter

and conﬁrmed the induced phosphorylation of Sp1 by
oxaliplatin treatment (Fig. 4F). HDAC may be one of the
Sp1/Sp3 corepressors that dissociates when Sp1 is phosphorylated by oxaliplatin, because treatment by sodium
butyrate, an HDAC inhibitor, totally abolished the Sp1mediated p21 repression (data not shown), consistent with
the known fact that HDAC inhibitor activates p21 expression
through Sp1 sites (26). However, there are many other
transcription factors and cofactors known to mediate Sp1
repression, and it is difﬁcult to rule out the involvement of
each of these factors (33). Moreover, because of the crowded
potential transcription factor binding sites, it is likely that
more than 1 factor may inﬂuence the oxaliplatin switch that
recruits repressive factors/cofactors to associate with the
unphosphorylated Sp1 and releases them when Sp1 is
phosphorylated.
Moreover, we investigated whether the conserved Sp1/Sp3
oxaliplatin-responsive elements are functional in p53-dependent transcription by using promoter assay and Western blot
analysis (Fig. 7A and 7B). Our results indicated that the p53
induction of p21 transcription was dominant but independent
of the oxaliplatin-responsive element-regulated basal level p21
expression. The discrepancy in p53 inductions between the
promoter assay and Western blot assay may be related to the
transfection efﬁciency of p53 and a more stable p21 protein
caused by oxaliplatin treatment.
Our data suggested that a previously unidentiﬁed, evolutionarily conserved Sp1/Sp3 element was required for maintaining p21 basal level expression and was responsible for the
derepression by oxaliplatin treatment though Sp1 phosphorylation. This element is strategically located about 100 bp
upstream from a cluster of 6 Sp1/Sp3 sites close to the TATA
box, with a unique palindrome structure. We speculate that by
locating the Sp1/Sp3 at this position and recruiting Sp1/Sp3
associated corepressors, including HDAC, this element "turns
off" the downstream Sp1/Sp3 sites to maintain p21 basal

transcription at a low level. Oxaliplatin treatment-induced Sp1
phosphorylation promotes the dissociation of these repressors
from this upstream Sp1/Sp3 location and derepresses the p21
promoter.
Our study uncovered a housekeeping function of a novel
evolutionarily conserved repressor element that responds to
oxaliplatin through Sp1 phosphorylation, independent of p53.
In addition, these results indicate an anticancer drug-screening strategy with the conserved element to identify p21-inducing drugs that may be useful in selecting clinical chemotherapy
drugs or for the research and development of new anticancer
compounds against p53-negative tumors.
