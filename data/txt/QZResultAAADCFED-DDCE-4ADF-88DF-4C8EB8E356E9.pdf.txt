ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of progesterone receptor
(PgR) as a biomarker for differentiating estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients who
fail to achieve a pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT)
with different prognoses. A total of 327 consecutive, locally advanced breast cancer
patients with ER-positive disease were included in this study. According to their
HER-2 and Ki-67 status, the patients were classified into the Luminal-A or Luminal-B
subtype. We evaluated the clinical and pathological response to NCT and relapse or
death occurring during follow-up according to PgR status in the different luminal
subtypes. In the Luminal-B subtype, patients with PgR- tumors had a relatively higher
pathological complete response (pCR) rate (29.5% vs. 4.7% pCR, P < 0.001) and
Miller-Payne grades (45.5% vs. 23.5% of grade 4-5, P = 0033) compared to PgR+
tumors. In Luminal-B patients with residual tumor after NCT, PgR loss was also
independently correlated with poor relapse-free survival (P = 0.017; HR = 0.430; PgRas a reference) and overall survival (P = 0.013; HR = 0.355; PgR- as a reference).
However, in the Luminal-A subtype, there were no statistically significant differences
between PgR+ and PgR- disease in response to NCT or survival. Our findings have
demonstrated the prognostic value of PgR loss in the neoadjuvant setting, indicating
that ER+/PgR- Luminal-B tumors warrant further attention due to their high risk of
relapse after primary treatment.

INTRODUCTION

primary treatment, the majority of patients still have a
high risk of relapse and death. In the last decades, various
approaches have focused on differentiating non-pCR
responders with different outcomes. Several prognostic
models have been reported, and some variables including
node status, residual tumor size, Ki-67, hormonal
receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
(HER2) have been shown to be potentially prognostic [3].
However, the results of these studies are not concordant,
indicating that the prognostic value of some markers might
not be consistent between different study populations.
In recent years, it has become widely accepted that

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) is the standard
of care for local control of local advanced breast cancer
(LABC), and allowing breast conservation. Most studies
confirmed that patients who achieved a pathological
complete response (pCR) after NCT were expected to have
a significantly more favorable outcome compared with
patients with residual disease in the breast and/or axillary
lymph nodes (known as non-pCR) [1, 2]. However,
because only 10%-30% of patients experience pCR after

breast cancer can be classified into multiple subtypes by
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of the estrogen
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), HER-2, and
Ki-67. Such an analysis is considered to be a surrogate
means for identifying molecular subtypes of breast cancer
with different prognoses across treatment settings [4].
Many common subtypes have been identified, including
two that are derived from hormonal receptor (HR)-positive
tumors (Luminal-A and Luminal-B) and two that are
derived from HR-negative tumors (triple-negative and
HER-2+ cancers). The Luminal-type breast cancers, which
are often associated with chemoresistance, have a better
outcome compared with non-luminal-type breast cancers,
as demonstrated by previous data [5, 6]. Moreover, recent
studies have suggested that in the neoadjuvant setting,
failure to achieve a pCR is clearly associated with worse
long-term outcomes in TNBC and HER-2+ breast cancer
but not in the majority of hormone receptor–positive breast
cancers [7, 8]. Therefore, the difference in the biological
features of HR+ and HR- tumors has resulted in different
recommendations for adjuvant systemic treatments and is
often attributed to the heterogeneity of biomarker studies.
Compared with ER, PgR is often considered to be
a weak prognostic marker for determining breast cancer

subtype [9]. The absence of PgR may be associated with
higher chemosensitivity and anti-estrogen resistance.
Recent studies have indicated that ER+, PgR- tumors
had more aggressive features that resulted in worse
outcomes compared with ER+, PgR+ tumors [10].
However, the prognostic value of PgR in the neoadjuvant
setting remains controversial. In the present study, we
investigated the relationship between PgR expression and
long-term survival in Luminal-type breast cancer patients
who received NCT, aiming to identify a distinct subset of
ER+ tumors.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics and response to NCT
The median age of the 327 patients was 49 years
(range: 25-70 years). All patients were diagnosed with
stage II or III disease, and 41.0% of them were postmenopausal at diagnosis. A total of 193 patients received
an anthracycline-based regimen, 114 received a taxanebased regimen, and 20 received both anthracycline

(both RFS and OS) in Luminal-B patients (P = 0.035 and P = 0.040, respectively), but not in Luminal-A patients (P = 0.229 and P = 0.542,
respectively).

and taxane as an NCT regimen. All the patients had
confirmed ER+ disease before NCT, and 225 of them
also had positive PgR expression in their primary tumors.
According to the expression of HER-2 and Ki-67 in
CNB tumor samples as determined by IHC analysis,
198 patients were classified into the Luminal-A subtype,
whereas 129 patients were classified into the Luminal-B
subtype (56 with HER-2+, 73 with HER-2-). The patient
characteristics and responses to NCT by breast cancer
subtype are shown in Table 1. Remarkably, patients with
Luminal-B disease were more likely to achieve a pCR
after NCT, with an observed pCR rate of 13.2%; on
the other hand, patients with Luminal-A disease had an
observed pCR rate of 5.1% (P = 0.009).
Furthermore, in Table 2 we show the distributions
of patient responses to NCT among the different
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

subtypes, demonstrating the relationship between PgR
and treatment response. In the Luminal-A subtype, there
were no statistically significant differences between
PgR+ and PgR- disease with respect to clinical response,
pathological response according to pCR rate, or response
scores according to the MP grading system. However, in
the Luminal-B subtype, patients with PgR- tumors had
a relatively higher pCR rate (29.5% vs. 4.7% pCR, P <
0.001) and MP grades (45.5% vs. 23.5% grade 4-5, P =
0033).

Correlation between PgR and survival
Overall, the observed 5-year RFS and 5-year OS of
the 327 patients were 68% and 81%, respectively, in the

Luminal-B subtype. Failure to achieve a pCR is clearly
associated with worse long-term outcomes in Luminal-B
breast cancer, although this negative prognostic
association is not statistically significant in Luminal-A
breast cancers. The 5-year RFS and 5-year OS of patients
with Luminal-A patients with pCR were 90.0% (compared
with 67.5% in non-pCR patients, log-rank test P = 0.168)

and 90.0% (compared with 80.4% in non-pCR patients,
log-rank test P = 0.476), respectively, whereas the 5-year
RFS and 5-year OS of Luminal-B patients with pCR were
94.1% (compared with 61.4% in non-pCR patients, logrank test P = 0.018) and 100.0% (compared with 75.9% in
non-pCR patients, log-rank test P = 0.023), respectively.
In non-pCR responders, univariate survival

and Luminal-B categories to detect the prognostic value
of PgR. PgR loss was significantly correlated with poor
survival (both RFS and OS) in Luminal-B patients
but not in Luminal-A patients. The distributions of the
survival curves are shown in Figure 1A-1D. Additionally,
multivariate survival analysis using the Cox regression
model was performed in Luminal-B patients. PgR status
(P = 0.017; HR = 0.430; PgR- as a reference), residual
tumor size (P = 0.003; HR = 1.690 for 2-5 cm, HR = 3.090
for > 5 cm; < 2 cm as a reference), residual lymph node
involvement (P = 0.014; HR = 0.843 for 1-3 positive node,
HR = 2.624 for ≥4 positive node; 0 positive node as a
reference), and Ki-67 (P = 0.015; HR = 2.245; < 15% as a
reference) were independent prognostic variables for RFS.
PgR status (P = 0.013; HR = 0.355; PgR- as a reference),
residual tumor size (P = 0.041; HR = 1.559 for 2-5 cm,
HR = 3.664 for > 5 cm; < 2 cm as a reference), and
residual lymph node involvement (P = 0.014; HR = 0.949
for 1-3 positive node, HR = 3.408 for ≥4 positive node;
0 positive node as a reference) were also independent
prognostic variables for OS. The results of the univariate
and multivariate survival analyses are shown in Table 3.
In addition, PgR had different prognostic values for
patient survival with respect to HER-2 status (Figure 2A,
2B). It was significantly correlated with RFS and OS in
HER-2- Luminal-B patients (P = 0.018 and P = 0.004,
respectively). However, in HER-2+ Luminal-B patients,
there was no significant difference in either RFS or OS
with respect to the PgR category (P = 0.562 and P = 0.794,
respectively).

different responses to chemotherapy [16]. Therefore,
breast cancer subtypes as defined by differential ER, PgR,
HER-2, and Ki-67 staining may display different response
rates and different prognoses in the neoadjuvant setting.
For ER+ breast cancers, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy
other than chemotherapy might be a more appropriate
choice for Luminal-A LABCs; however, there is a lack
of consensus on the threshold indication for inclusion of
NCT for the Luminal-B subtype. Compared to Luminal-A
breast cancer, the Luminal-B phenotype has aggressive
clinical and biological features and is characterized by
lower levels of ER-related genes, higher levels of HER2-associated genes, and higher levels of proliferative
markers [17, 18].
Given that HER-2 overexpression was only
observed in 30% of Luminal-B tumors, the Luminal-B
phenotype still represents a heterogeneous group of breast
cancers. A better understanding of this tumor phenotype
might allow better determination of appropriate diagnostic
and therapeutic strategies. Several approaches have
been undertaken to differentiate Luminal-B tumors with
different chemosensitivity and survival [19, 20]. Recently,
G. Cancello [21] reported a relatively good prognosis in
the PgR+ subgroup of Luminal-B patients and highlighted
the significant impact of PgR status on the outcome of
patients with early breast cancer. The author claimed to
consider more chemotherapy in the ER+/PgR−/HER-2−
subgroup and less radical therapy for the “triple positive”
subgroup in the primary setting. It is speculated that ER+/
PgR- tumors may display more aggressive features than
ER+/PgR+ tumors. In this study, we also found that PgR
was an important predictive and prognostic biomarker in
Luminal-B patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Compared
with PgR+ patients, patients with PgR- Luminal-B disease
had relatively higher pCR rates and MP grades. However,
among Luminal-B patients failing to achieve pCR, the loss
of PgR resulted in a high risk of relapse or death. This
paradox indicated that PgR status could be used to identify
a unique phenotype of Luminal-B breast cancers. This
group of tumors has higher response rates to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy; however, this advantage is not clearly
translated into survival benefit among non-pCR patients.
In this study, the discrimination of Luminal-A
and Luminal-B subtype were based on the criteria of
St.Gallen Consensus 2011. However, in 2013, some
experts suggested that ER+/PgR-low patients should
also be included in the Luminal-B subtype based on gene
expression profiling. Interestingly, in this study, PgR was
only prognostic in HER-2-/Luminal-B tumors but not in
HER-2+/Luminal-B or Luminal-A ER+ tumors, which
indicated that PgR-/HER-2- with low Ki-67 could not be
simply affiliated to Luminal-B subtype.
Considering their high response rate to
chemotherapy and poor survival, ER+/PR-/HER-2patients with high proliferation rates displayed biological
behaviors similar to those of patients with triple-

DISCUSSION
NCT, which downstages the disease and enables
surgery to be performed in those initially deemed
inoperable, has been widely accepted as a standard of
care for LABCs. Most published studies have affirmed
that patients who achieve pCR, irrespective of the initial
stage and molecular subtype, have a very low risk of
relapse and death [2, 11]. However, a pCR occurs in only
approximately 10%-30% of all cases and depends on the
biological features of the primary tumor to a large extent.
For patients who fail to achieve pCR, the response to
subsequent treatment and prognosis also varies between
different subgroups [12, 13].
Although gene expression profiling has led to a
better understanding of the biological phenotypes of
breast cancer, its technical complexity and high costs have
limited its clinical application. The combination of IHC
markers, including ER, PgR, HER-2, and Ki-67, has been
accepted as a substitute for molecular subtypes, although
the results obtained with gene expression profiling and
IHC do not exactly correspond [14, 15]. It is well known
that HER-2 overexpression, negativity for hormonal
receptors, and a high Ki-67 index are significantly
correlated with high chemosensitivity and result in

negative breast cancer [12]. Despite a better response
to neoadjuvant treatments compared to other subtypes
of tumors, the long-term prognosis of PR-/HER-2Luminal-B patients is worse overall than that of other
subsets, particularly in the first three years after treatment
(Figure 2). Thus, Luminal-B tumors that are resistant to
primary chemotherapy might exhibit aggressive behavior
and benefit little from further chemo-endocrine treatment.
The loss of PgR may be a surrogate marker of a
nonfunctional ER, and it also reflects aberrant growth
factor signaling that activates other ER functions other
than the PgR pathway [22]. Thus, lack of PgR may
contribute to endocrine resistance, which results in poor
outcome. Furthermore, ER+/PgR- tumors might also
express higher levels of HER-1 and HER-2, which are
associated with a significantly poorer outcome, whereas
in ER+/PgR+ disease, neither HER-1 expression nor
HER-2 overexpression is associated with outcome [22].
In this study, PgR failed to show prognostic value in HER2+ patients. Because trastuzumab was not given prior
to surgery in this study, HER-2+ patients who did not
achieve pCR could still benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab,
which might result in an unclear survival impact of PgR
loss in this specific phenotype. Thus, additional studies
examining ER+/HER-2+ patients treated with trastuzumab
prior to surgery are needed to clarify this issue.
In summary, although Luminal-type patients are
assumed to have a relatively good prognosis, different
permutations and combinations of biomarkers are
associated with variable tumor behavior, as we have
described for the ER+/PR−/HER-2- subset. Our findings
have demonstrated the prognostic value of PgR loss
in the neoadjuvant setting, indicating that PgR- high
Luminal-B tumors require greater attention due to their
high risk of relapse after primary treatment. Prospective
approaches regarding tailored treatment strategies should
be considered for this unique subset of Luminal-B tumors.

A total of 327 consecutive locally advanced
breast cancer patients met the above criteria. The NCT
regimens included anthracycline-based, taxane-based,
and anthracycline-taxane-based regimens for a median
of 3 cycles, as previously reported [23]. For all patients,
the surgical procedure included mastectomy and axillary
lymph node dissection upon the completion of NCT.
Additional cycles of chemotherapy were subsequently
performed to complete a total of 6–8 cycles followed by
radiation therapy at the discretion of the treating physician
and radiologist. Endocrine therapy was recommended for
all patients in the present study. Due to health insurancerelated limitations, trastuzumab was not utilized before
surgery in patients overexpressing HER-2.
Responses to NCT were evaluated clinically
and pathologically. Clinical response was based on
the reduction of tumor size and node status as detected
through MRI and ultrasound according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 [24].
Pathological response was evaluated according to the
Miller-Payne (MP) grading system [25]. A pathological
complete response (pCR) after NCT was defined as the
absence of invasive carcinoma in both the breast tissue
(MP Grade 5) and lymph nodes of the resected specimen.
Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only were
also considered as pCR responders.

Immunohistochemistry and intrinsic subtypes
Immunohistochemistry and/or fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) assays were used for the detection of
ER, PgR, HER-2 and Ki-67. The cut-off value for ER and
PgR positivity was 1% tumor cells with positive nuclear
staining. HER-2 was evaluated as 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+ using
circumferential membrane-bound staining, and positivity
(HER-2+) was considered as 3+ based a positive result
via IHC analysis or positivity via FISH; cases considered
as 0 to 1+ or 2+ without FISH positivity were regarded as
negative (HER-2-). The Ki-67 value was expressed as the
percentage of positive cells (at least 1000) with nuclear
staining in each case. The antibodies used were as follows:
ER (M7047, clone 1D5, Dako, Denmark), PgR (M3569,
clone PgR 636, Dako), HER-2 (A0485, polyclonal rabbit
antibody, Dako), and Ki-67 (M7240, clone MIB-1, Dako).
On the basis of the 2011 St. Gallen consensus [15], the
patient cohort of the present study was divided into two
intrinsic subtypes: Luminal-A (HER-2 negative and Ki67 < 15%) and Luminal-B (HER-2 positive, or HER-2
negative and Ki-67≥15%).

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study population
The patient cohort in the present study had ER+
primary breast cancer and received NCT followed by
surgery at Shanghai Cancer Center from 1999 to 2009. All
patients’ diseases were confirmed as invasive carcinoma
through core needle biopsy (CNB), and node status
was assessed through fine needle aspiration (FNA) of
palpable lymph nodes before NCT. Patients who had any
treatment prior to NCT were not eligible for this study.
Other exclusion criteria included metastatic disease before
surgery, bilateral breast cancer, male breast cancer, and
inflammatory breast cancer. Informed written consent was
obtained from all subjects prior to the study.

Statistical analysis
The chi-square test was used to evaluate the
distribution of patient characteristics and the relationship
between PgR and response to NCT among Luminal-A and
18180

Luminal-B subtypes. The Fisher exact test was performed
when necessary. Survival analyses were performed
using the Cox regression model. Statistically significant
prognostic variables in the univariate analysis were
tested in the multivariate model with forward selection.
The distributions of survival curves were shown using
the Kaplan–Meier method, and the differences were
measured using the log-rank test. Relapse-free survival
(RFS) was calculated from the date of surgery to the date
of disease relapse (local or distant relapse or death from
any cause). Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
date of diagnosis to the date of death or last follow-up.
Patients without events or death were censored at the last
follow-up. All P-values reported were two sided and were
calculated at a significance level of 0.05. All statistical
procedures were carried out using SPSS (version 13.0;
SPSS Company, Chicago, IL).
