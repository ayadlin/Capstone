ABSTRACT
The NADPH oxidase, NOX5, is known to stimulate cell proliferation in some
cancers by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). We show here that the long
form of NOX5 (NOX5-L) also promotes cell death, and thus determines the balance
of proliferation and death, in skin, breast and lung cancer cells. Moderate expression
of NOX5-L induced cell proliferation accompanied by AKT and ERK phosphorylation,
whereas an increase in NOX5-L above a certain threshold promoted cancer cell death
accompanied by caspase-3 activation. Notably, cisplatin treatment increased NOX5-L
levels through CREB activation and enhanced NOX5-L activity through augmentation
of Ca2+ release and c-Abl expression, ultimately triggering ROS-mediated cancer cell
death—a distinct pathway absent in normal cells. These results indicate that NOX5-L
determines cellular responses in a concentration- and context-dependent manner.

However, until now, most studies have focused on the
role of NOX as a mediator of cell proliferation and
thus tumorigenesis. For example, the roles of NOX1 in
tumorigenesis are well understood in colon [12] and gastric
cancers [13], and NOX4 is closely linked to tumorigenesis
in pancreatic cancer [14] and melanoma [15].
Compared with the contributions of other NOX
members, the function and regulation of NOX5 in
tumorigenesis are largely unknown, partly because
of limitations in experimental models, as rodents
lack NOX5 [16, 17]. Nonetheless, there is a growing
consensus that the level of NOX5 is an important factor in
certain cancers, such as prostate cancer [18], esophageal
adenocarcinoma [19], and melanomas [20].
There are two forms of NOX5 differentiated by
the presence or absence of Ca2+-binding EF-hands on
the N-terminus: the long form, NOX5-L, and the short
form, NOX5-S [21]. Notably, most NOX5 studies
have focused on NOX5-S as a mediator of cancer cell
proliferation [19, 21, 22].

INTRODUCTION
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were once considered
detrimental cellular byproducts; however, they are now
widely accepted as signaling molecules that can determine
whether cells proliferate or die [1, 2]. ROS stimulate this
proliferation switch through several mechanisms [3],
including AKT [4, 5] and Ras-ERK (extracellular signalregulated kinase) pathways [2, 6, 7]. In contrast, it is known
that a high level of ROS can trigger cell death by mediating
apoptosis through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38
MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways [2, 3].
These pathways are activated by antineoplastic agents that
elevate intracellular ROS [8, 9].
Members of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family
are the only enzymes that generate ROS as their main
product [10]. They reduce molecular oxygen in an NADPHdependent fashion to generate superoxide anion [11].
Considering the pleiotropic effects of ROS, NOX activity
might contribute to cellular death as well as proliferation.

In this study, we found that NOX5-L operates as a
central switch in the context of tumorigenesis, such that
NOX5-L–dependent production of moderate levels of
ROS triggers cell proliferation, whereas high levels of
NOX5-L promote cancer cell death.

cells is controversial because NOX has also been shown
to potentiate cisplatin resistance in glioma [26] and
renal cancer cells [27]. Therefore, the exact mechanism
by which cisplatin increases ROS and therefore cell
death in skin, breast, and lung cancers has not been
fully elucidated. We first found that cisplatin treatment
increased ROS production in G-361, SK-BR-3, and HOP92 cells by approximately 2-fold, but did not enhanced
ROS generation in WI-38 cells (Figure 2A). These results
suggest that cisplatin may kill tumor cells, but spares
normal cells because of differential ROS generation.
We next determined whether NOX increases
ROS production in response to cisplatin treatment.
Diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NOX, reduced
ROS in cisplatin-treated HOP-92 cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2B).
Unlike other NOX family members, NOX5
constitutively produces ROS by itself [28]. This is notable
because NOX5 expression levels can be an important
determinant of NOX5 activity. To determine whether
NOX5 levels are pivotal in cisplatin-induced ROS
generation, we examined NOX5 levels after cisplatin
treatment. We found that NOX5 levels were increased
in cisplatin-treated G-361 and HOP-92 cells (Figure 2C
and Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B). A further analysis
of these results in G-361, SK-BR-3, and HOP-92 cells
using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that NOX5 mRNA levels
were increased approximately 2-fold by cisplatin treatment
(Figure 2D). Consistent with this result, NOX5-L protein
levels were increased in cisplatin-treated cells (Figure 2E).
To confirm the role of NOX5-L in cisplatininduced ROS generation, we depleted NOX5-L in G-361,
SK-BR-3, and HOP-92 cells using small interfering
RNA (siRNA) targeting NOX5-L. Cisplatin treatment
induced significantly less ROS production in NOX5-L
siRNA-transfected cells than in control cells (Figure 2F),
indicating that NOX5-L is required for cisplatininduced ROS production in skin, breast, and lung cancer
cells. Finally, shRNA-mediated NOX5-L knockdown
experiments showed that cisplatin-induced cell death
required NOX5-L (Figure 2G). We note that NOX5-L
shRNA did not completely inhibit cisplatin-induced
cell death because cisplatin also triggers other signaling
pathways and NOX5-L depletion itself induced cell death
(unpublished data).

RESULTS
An increase in NOX5-L above a certain
threshold promotes cancer cell death
NOX5 expression has been observed in some cancer
cells, but it is rarely detected in normal cells, except those
of reproductive and vascular systems [17]. Here, we asked
whether NOX5-L overexpression promoted proliferation
of normal cells. As expected, NOX5-L overexpression
in WI-38 (normal human lung fibroblasts) and MCF10A
(normal human mammary epithelial cells) cells induced
cell proliferation (Figure 1A) and resulted in production of
ROS (Figure 1E). These findings suggest that generation
of ROS by NOX5-L promotes cell proliferation.
Next, we sought to identify the mechanism by
which NOX5-L induced proliferation in normal cells. To
this end, we examined the effect of NOX5-L expression
on the activation of the main downstream effectors of
tumorigenesis, AKT and ERK1/2, in normal cells. In WI-38
and MCF10A cells, NOX5-L expression led to the
phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 1B). We then investigated this effect in
cancer cells. Surprisingly, NOX5-L overexpression in
G-361 (skin malignant melanoma), SK-BR-3 (breast
adenocarcinoma), and HOP-92 (lung carcinoma) cells
inhibited cell proliferation (Figure 1C and Supplementary
Figure 1). This suggests that NOX5-L promotes cancer
cell death when its levels are increased above a certain
threshold. We next assessed the cause of cancer cell death
and found that increased amounts of NOX5-L promoted
apoptosis (Figure 1D). Additionally, NOX5-L expression
resulted in production of ROS in cancer cells (Figure 1E).
This is also consistent with the fact that high levels of
NOX5-L, and therefore high levels of ROS, trigger cell
death through apoptosis [2]. Taken together, these results
indicate that NOX5-L is a critical regulator of the balance
between proliferation and death in cancer cells.

ROS production via NOX5-L upregulation

Cisplatin induces CREB-mediated upregulation

Having demonstrated that NOX5-L overexpression
triggers cancer cell death (Figure 1), we sought to identify
conditions that increase NOX5-L expression. It has been
reported that cisplatin induces ROS production [8, 23]
and that NOX1 and NOX4 are responsible for cisplatininduced ROS generation and toxicity in normal
auditory [24] and kidney cells [25]. Nevertheless, the

We next sought to determine which transcription
factors are involved in NOX5-L upregulation by cisplatin
treatment. Although it has been reported that STAT5
activation contributes to susceptibility to cisplatin [29],
we found that STAT5A expression did not alter NOX5-L
levels in cisplatin-treated cells (Figure 3A). Notably,

cisplatin activates CREB (cAMP response element-binding

mediates acid-induced NOX5-S expression in esophageal
adenocarcinoma cells [19], although the promoter region
of NOX5-S is completely different from that of NOX5-L.

Therefore, we investigated whether CREB upregulates
NOX5-L expression after cisplatin treatment. We found
that CREB was activated in response to cisplatin treatment
(Figure 3B), and that overexpression of CREB(Y134F), a
constitutively active CREB [31], induced the expression

siRNA-transfected cells. These findings suggest that
CREB upregulates NOX5-L after cisplatin treatment in
skin and lung cancer cells.
Interestingly, the endogenous level of NOX5-L was
also decreased by CREB knockdown in G-361 and HOP92 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Thus, we thought it
possible that CREB might also upregulate NOX5-L in the
absence of cisplatin in skin and lung cancers; if so, this
would suggest that CREB is required for tumorigenesis
as well as cisplatin-induced cell death. However,
immunohistochemistry showed that only 8% of lung
cancer tissues (4 of 50) were positive for phosphorylated
(activated) CREB (p-CREB). In addition, even though
more skin cancer tissues were p-CREB positive, there
was no correlation between NOX5 and activated CREB.
Therefore, activated CREB is a critical regulator of
NOX5-L transcription in cisplatin-treated lung and skin
cancer cells, but not tumorigenesis in these cancers.

activate NOX5-L in cisplatin-treated cells. Interestingly,
imatinib, a c-Abl inhibitor, protects against cisplatininduced ovarian follicle loss [34] and suppresses cisplatininduced cell death in breast cancer cells [35]. Nevertheless,
the effect of imatinib on cisplatin-treated cancer cells is
controversial because imatinib has also been shown to
potentiate cisplatin sensitivity [36]. To clarify the effect
of imatinib on cisplatin-treated cells, we treated HOP-92
cells with both agents. We found that cisplatin-induced
ROS generation was decreased by imatinib (Figure 5B)
and siRNA specific for c-Abl (Figure 5C). We also asked
whether cisplatin-induced cell death requires c-Abl. Under
c-Abl–depleted conditions, cisplatin caused less cell death
compared with control conditions (Figure 5D), suggesting
that c-Abl stimulates NOX5-L-mediated ROS production,
and ultimately promotes cell death in cisplatin-treated
cells.
Finally, we considered the possibility that, as was
shown for Ca2+, c-Abl was required for upregulation of
NOX5-L levels and activity by cisplatin treatment. We
found that c-Abl knockdown decreased cisplatin-induced
expression of NOX5-L (Figure 5E). Thus, NOX5-L
activation after cisplatin treatment is at least partially a
consequence of a c-Abl–dependent increase in NOX5-L
levels.

Cisplatin triggers cell death by increasing
NOX5-L activity through augmentation of Ca2+
release and c-Abl expression
NOX5 can be activated by several factors, including
Ca2+ [32] and c-Abl [33]. Thus, we assessed whether
cisplatin treatment could stimulate NOX5-L activity
through these factors.
We first found that cisplatin treatment increased
intracellular Ca2+ levels (Figure 4A). Next, we assessed
whether ROS production, indicative of NOX5-L
activation, is increased by cisplatin-induced Ca2+
elevation. Chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTAAM and EGTA abolished ROS production in cisplatintreated HOP-92 and SK-BR-3 cells (Figure 4B).
Additionally, co-treatment with cisplatin and thapsigargin,
the latter of which induces Ca2+ release, activated NOX5-L
further, as demonstrated by ROS generation in HOP-92
cells (Figure 4B). Consistently, NOX5-L activation by
cisplatin-induced Ca2+ release was correlated with cancer
cell death. Ca2+ depletion reduced cisplatin-induced cell
death (Figure 4C); however, it did not entirely block the
cell death, likely because other mediators of cisplatin
stimulation might still operate even in the absence of Ca2+.
We then considered the possibility that cisplatin-induced
Ca2+ release increases NOX5-L levels as well as NOX5-L
activity. We found that Ca2+ depletion by BAPTA-AM
suppressed cisplatin-induced increases in NOX5-L
levels in association with decreased CREB activation
(Figure 4D), indicating that the increase in intracellular
Ca2+ concentration caused by cisplatin treatment acts
through CREB activation to upregulate NOX5-L.
Therefore, cisplatin-induced activation of NOX5-L is due,
at least in part, to Ca2+-dependent induction of NOX5-L
expression.
We next found that cisplatin treatment increased
c-Abl levels (Figure 5A), suggesting that c-Abl might

DISCUSSION
NOX isoforms have hitherto received attention as
regulators of cancer cell proliferation. Here, we focused
on a binary role of NOX5-L in both proliferation and death
of cancer cells that has not been previously reported. We
show that proliferation and death are promoted by two
different transcriptional regulators of NOX5-L in cancer
cells: STAT5A (unpublished data) and CREB, respectively.
In the case of cancer cell death, Ca2+ and c-Abl are critical
mediators of NOX5-L activation (Figure 6). Cisplatin
increased both the level and activity of NOX5-L in cancer
cells, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation.
Cisplatin exerts its tumoricidal activity through
DNA-damage–induced cell signaling [37]; however,
the selectivity towards cancer cells cannot be explained
by DNA damage because cisplatin causes the formation
of DNA adducts in both normal and cancer cells [38].
One possible explanation for this selectivity that
has been advanced is based on the observation that
Bcl-xL undergoes deamidation only in susceptible cancer
cells [38, 39]. In the current study, we provide another
basis for the selectivity of cisplatin towards cancer cells:
ROS production generated by NOX5-L. In response to
cisplatin, ROS were produced only in cancer cells and not
in normal cells (Figure 2A). Therefore, NOX5-L activity,
and thus ROS generation, might be used as a marker to
predict sensitivity to cisplatin.
Even though the initial response to cisplatin
treatment is usually outstanding, resistance becomes a

MATERIALS AND METHODS

major challenge. The typical approach for overcoming such
resistance is administration of combinatorial therapy [37].
Our findings suggest that the activity of NOX5-L
may be pivotal for decisions regarding combinatorial
anticancer therapy with cisplatin for a number of reasons.
(i) Cisplatin and antineoplastic agents that increase
intracellular Ca2+ may have additive effects on cancer
treatment. Because cisplatin-induced intracellular Ca2+
release activates NOX5-L, additional Ca2+ induced
by other antineoplastic agents would further activate
NOX5-L and thus enhance ROS-mediated cell death.
(ii) Anti-hypertension medications that antagonize Ca2+,
such as nifedipine and amlodipine, may decrease cisplatin
efficacy. Ca2+ antagonists can counteract the effect of
cisplatin-induced Ca2+ release, thus inhibiting NOX5-L
activation. (iii) Imatinib may inhibit cisplatin efficacy.
Although cisplatin induced an increase in c-Abl, which
activates NOX5-L, imatinib inhibited c-Abl and therefore
suppressed NOX5-L.
Although we have demonstrated that CREB, Ca2+,
and c-Abl are critical regulators of NOX5-L in cisplatininduced cell death, we do not exclude the possibility
that other mechanisms, including ubiquitination [40]
and phosphorylation [41], or other regulators also affect
NOX5-L levels and activity.

was
determined
using
2ʹ,7ʹ-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA;
Molecular Probes). Cells were incubated with 20 μM
H2DCFDA for 45 min at 37°C, trypsinized, washed,
resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and
immediately analyzed using a Victor X3 Multilabel Plate
Reader (Perkin Elmer; excitation 485 nm, emission 535 nm).
