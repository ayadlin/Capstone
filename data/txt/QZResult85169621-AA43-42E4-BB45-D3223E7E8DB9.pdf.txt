and treatment approaches often are limited by their toxicity. With the incorporation of targeted therapies, the number of options available for patients with
SCCHN is growing. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in
the development and progression of SCCHN and is associated with a poor prognosis. The anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (MoAb) cetuximab is the first targeted
therapy to be developed for SCCHN. Recent data confirmed a survival advantage
and enhanced locoregional control of SCCHN with cetuximab plus radiotherapy
(RT) in patients with locally advanced (LA) SCCHN. Single-agent cetuximab conferred clinical benefits for patients with platinum-refractory metastatic disease,
and a recent phase 3 trial demonstrated a survival benefit with cetuximab and
standard platinum-based therapy in the front-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic disease. Cetuximab has a toxicity profile milder than that of cytoxic agents
and does not exacerbate RT toxicity when it is used in combination. Small-molecule EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors also have shown promise in combination
with chemoradiotherapy or as single agents, although they are in earlier stages of
developmental. Other targeted approaches (eg, antiangiogenics) are also under
investigation. Ongoing clinical trials will further define targeted treatment roles in
all stages of SCCHN. Cancer 2008;112:2635–45.  2008 American Cancer Society.

quamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is a
challenging disease to treat successfully, and the median survival (MS) has changed little over the past few decades.1 Patients
with SCCHN are at risk of developing subsequent primary tumors
(constant incidence rate, 2%–4% each year)2 and have a high prevalence of comorbidities and problematic lifestyle habits (ie, smoking, alcoholism).
For most patients who initially are diagnosed with locally
advanced (LA) disease (stage III/IV),3 a multidisciplinary approach
incorporating chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy (RT), and surgery
often is required. Although distant metastases rarely are present at
diagnosis, eventual relapse is common in these patients.3–7 Those
with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN have a poor prognosis and few
effective treatment options other than palliative CT. The MS typically ranges from 6 months to 8 months (3 months for refractory
patients).3,8–11
Early-stage SCCHN usually is curable with definitive RT/surgery.
Surgery also may be the initial treatment for certain patients with

LA disease. For patients with postsurgical adverse
features or unresectable LA disease, combined CT/
RT, ie, chemoradiotherapy (CRT), is the current
standard. Numerous phase 3 trials and meta-analyses
have proven that CRT is superior to RT alone,
because it reduces the risk of locoregional recurrence
and improves survival.5,12–21
Among current refinements are altered RT fractionation schedules, which may improve overall survival
(OS) and locoregional control compared with conventional (once-daily) delivery.22 An ongoing trial (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG]-0123) may
provide a definitive answer, because that trial is comparing conventional delivery directly with altered-fractionation schedules.
Another recent advance—intensity-modulated RT
(IMRT)—uses multiple-shaped radiation beams,
which increase the doses delivered to tumor tissue
while limiting exposure/scatter to normal structures.23,24 Compared with a reference 3-dimensional
conformal therapy plan, IMRT demonstrated that
conformity was improved for all target volumes, with
statistically significant reductions in irradiation of
parotid glands and spinal cord (N 5 26; P < .001).25
Therefore, although technically it is more challenging
and time consuming, IMRT use in the United States
appears to be increasing.26
It also has been proposed that induction CT
before CRT may improve distant disease control
(which typically is stagnant in concurrent CRT or
altered-fractionation RT trials) and, thus, overall efficacy. Although induction CT has improved organ
preservation in patients with advanced laryngeal cancer,27,28 a meta-analysis of 63 randomized trials conducted in 2000 indicated that there was no
statistically significant benefit in OS or locoregional
control for induction treatment.17 Recent phase 3
studies, however, have demonstrated that docetaxelbased induction (docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) (TPF) was superior to the classic combination of cisplatin and 5-FU (PF) that was used in
earlier trials,29–32 with 3-year survival rates of 62%
and 48% for TPF and PF, respectively (P 5 .0058;
hazard ratio, 0.7). Although TPF now represents the
new standard in induction CT, it is not yet clear
whether adding TPF induction will improve the efficacy of full-dose CRT.31 Ongoing trials are comparing
sequential therapy (induction TPF followed by CRT)
with concurrent CRT alone (Table 1).33,34 Additional
trials are evaluating different RT-based regimens
(such as cetuximab plus RT; see below) after TPF.
For patients with recurrent/metastatic disease,
systemic CT is the standard treatment. Front-line
regimens are platinum-based; combinations of either

cisplatin or carboplatin with 5-FU or a taxane are
associated with a 30% overall response (OR) rate
(ORR), a 3- to 4-month median progression-free survival (PFS), and a median OS of 6 months to
9 months.3,11,35 For patients who have disease that
progresses after platinum-based therapy, options are
limited to modestly active agents or best supportive
care (BSC).36
More aggressive cytotoxic therapy in SCCHN,
however, is associated with heightened risk for both
acute and long-term adverse effects. Therapy-related
adverse events have particular impact in this patient
population, in which multiple physical/mental comorbidities (eg, tobacco/alcohol addiction; pulmonary,
cardiovascular, hepatic, and neurologic disorders)
complicate toxicity management, hinder treatment
compliance, and have an adverse effect on survival
rates.37 Acute grade 3/4 toxicities, particularly mucositis, occur more frequently with CRT compared with
RT alone.12,19,20 Cumulative and potentially irreversible
nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity diminish the clinical
usefulness of cisplatin in patients with SCCHN and
limit the options for treatment at relapse; excessive
toxicity has rendered high-dose/dose-intensified cisplatin delivery largely unsuccessful.38–40 Recent incorporation of targeted therapies into managing SCCHN
may improve current therapy options and allow more
tolerable treatment regimens.

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-based Strategies
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a
member of the HER family of tyrosine kinase (TK)
growth factor receptors, a group of proteins whose
aberrant activity plays a key role growth and metastasis of solid tumors.41 Binding to EGFR by its natural ligands—mainly epidermal growth factor (EGF)
or transforming growth factor (TGF-a)—results in stimulation of downstream signal-transduction pathways, ultimately leading to cell cycle progression,
reduced apoptotic capacity, angiogenesis, and meta-

Targeted Therapy in Head & Neck Cancer/Langer

static phenotypes.42 EGFR and its ligand TGF-a are
overexpressed in nearly all head and neck tumors43–46;
expression typically is associated with greater radioresistence/chemoresistance and shorter disease-free
survival (DFS) and OS in patients.45,47–50 The EGFR
appears to be associated specifically with adaptive
responses to radiation; after exposure to radiation,
the EGFR activation observed in radioresistant tumor
models is greater than in tumors that originally were
radiosensitive.51
Anti-EGFR agents are antiproliferative and have
been developed as promising therapeutic anticancer
treatments for several solid tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and SCCHN.52,53 EGFR inhibition
also has radiosensitizing and synergistic effects with
DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents in vitro.51,54–57 The
only anti-EGFR agent that currently is approved by
the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the treatment of patients with SCCHN is
cetuximab (ImClone Systems Incorporated, NY, NY
and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ),
which is a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed at
the EGFR extracellular domain. Other EGFR inhibitors (EGFRIs) include the MoAb panitumumab
(Amgen Pharmaceuticals, Thousand Oaks, Calif ) and
the TK inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib (Astra Zeneca, Inc.,
London, United Kingdom) and erlotinib (OSI Pharmaceuticals, Melville, NY) (Fig. 1).52

Cetuximab
Cetuximab is a chimeric human:murine MoAb that
binds competitively to the EGFR with a higher affinity than its endogenous ligands (ie, EGF and TGF-a),
preventing dimerization and activation of the intrinsic receptor TK.58 Cetuximab also affects ligand-independent EGFR signaling.59 In preclinical models,
treatment with cetuximab stimulated EGFR internalization/degradation,60,61 enhanced tumor-cell apoptosis, and inhibited proliferation, angiogenesis, and
invasiveness.54,62,63 Preclinical experiments also indicated that immune-mediated mechanisms, such as
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, may
contribute to cetuximab’s anticancer activity.64–66 In
addition to SCCHN, cetuximab has demonstrated
efficacy in the treatment of metastatic CRC
(mCRC)67,68 and currently is under investigation in
advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Combination Therapy in LA Disease
A phase 3, randomized, international trial compared
RT alone with cetuximab plus RT in 424 patients
with stage III/IV SCCHN. The radiation regimen was
determined by each participating institution and

consisted of either 1 or 2 fractions per day with or
without concomitant boost, although most patients
received some form of hyperfractionation. Cetuximab
was administered at an initial dose of 400 mg/m2
followed by 250 mg/m2 per week for the duration of
RT. The trial’s primary endpoint was duration of
locoregional control; secondary endpoints included
OS, PFS, OR, and safety. At median follow-up (54
months), duration of locoregional control increased
significantly from 14.9 months to 24.4 months (P 5
.005) in patients who received cetuximab plus RT.
The 1-, 2-, and 3-year locoregional control rates were
also superior for cetuximab plus RT versus RT alone
(P < .01). Overall, adding cetuximab to high-dose RT
reduced locoregional progression risk by 32% with a
26% reduction in the risk of death (Fig. 2). Cetuximab plus RT significantly increased median OS from
29.3 months to 49 months (P 5 .03) and increased
the 2- and 3-year survival rates (62% vs 55% and 55%
vs 45%, respectively).69
These efficacy results were achieved without the
prohibitive exacerbation of toxic effects often associated with CRT. With the exception of grade 3
acneform rash (17% with cetuximab plus RT vs 1%
with RT alone; P < .001) and infusion reactions (3%
vs 0%, respectively; P 5 .01), the incidence of grade
3 toxic effects, including mucositis, did not differ
significantly between treatment groups. This was the
first phase 3 study to establish that a targeted therapy could improve outcomes in SCCHN when com-

bined with RT and served as 1 of the justifications
for the FDA approval of cetuximab for patients with
SCCHN.70
Integrating targeted agents, such as cetuximab,
with CRT for the treatment of SCCHN also has been
studied actively. In a phase 2 study at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 22 patients with previously untreated SCCHN (86% stage IV) received
bolus cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, concomitant boost RT (70 grays [Gy]), and cetuximab at a
standard dose of 250 mg/m2 per week (loading dose,
400 mg/m2). At median follow-up (52 months), the
ORR was 94% and included 13 partial responses (PR)
and 2 complete responses (CRs). The 3-year OS rate
was 76%, and the PFS rate was 56%—unusually positive outcomes considering the disease status of
patients at enrollment. That study, however, was
closed early because of toxicity concerns, including 2
deaths, neither of which was considered treatmentrelated.71
Nonetheless, the promising efficacy results of
concurrent cetuximab plus CRT provided ample rationale for a more thorough investigation. Preliminary results from a phase 2 study of concurrent
cetuximab, paclitaxel (40 mg/m2 per week), carboplatin (area under the curve, 2), and RT (once daily;
72 Gy total) have indicated that this regimen is feasible with acceptable toxicity. All patients in the initial
cohort (N 5 21) completed their planned RT regimens, and no grade 4 toxicities were encountered.
The most relevant grade 3 adverse events included
mucositis (89% of patients), dysphagia (17%), leuco-

penia (17%), in-field skin desquamation (11%), and
fever (11%). The CR rate was 72%, which, together
with the additional 4 patients who underwent neck
dissection after therapy, rendered 95% of patients
disease free after the completion of all treatment.72
Two large studies recently initiated by the RTOG
are seeking to confirm the role of cetuximab plus
concurrent CRT. The first is a phase 3 trial that combines cisplatin and accelerated RT with or without
cetuximab (RTOG-0522); it will enroll >700 patients
with newly diagnosed SCCHN to evaluate whether
cetuximab plus CRT improves DFS. The RTOG has
chosen concomitant boost radiation as its ‘‘standard’’
for this study. To date (March 2008), >500 patients
have been enrolled. A phase 2 randomized study
(RTOG-0234), which has completed accrual, will evaluate adjuvant cetuximab plus weekly CRT in combination with either cisplatin or docetaxel in resected
SCCHN (Table 2). A second phase 2 trial (E3303),
orchestrated through the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), will evaluate cetuximab plus concurrent CRT in unresectable SCCHN followed by
cetuximab maintenance treatment. That study completed accrual in late 2006 with >65 enrollees; to
date, there has been only 1 treatment-related death.
Finally, several ongoing phase 2 studies, including
ECOG 2303, are investigating cetuximab-based therapy as part of an organ-preservation strategy and
cetuximab as part of adjuvant regimens.73

Cetuximab in Recurrent/Metastatic Disease
Single-agent cetuximab is active in patients with
SCCHN after failure on platinum-based therapy. Preliminary findings in 103 patients with documented
progression of metastatic disease demonstrated an
ORR of 13%; the disease-control rate (CR 1 PR 1
stable disease [SD]) was 46%. The median time to
progression was 70 days, and the median OS was 178

Targeted Therapy in Head & Neck Cancer/Langer

days. Treatment was tolerated well, with grade 1/2
rash the most common cetuximab-related adverse
event. One treatment-related death was caused by an
infusion-related reaction.74 Vermorken et al., compared data from this trial with data from a retrospective study of 151 patients with recurrent/metastatic
SCCHN treated who received a variety of therapies,
including CT, RT, and BSC. Cetuximab monotherapy
compared favorably to BSC, with an absolute
increase of 2.5 months in median OS compared with
historic controls (5.9 months vs 3.4 months); adding
platinum to cetuximab, compared with single-agent
cetuximab, did not improve survival further in that
analysis,36 a consistent finding in phase 2 studies.
The clinical activity of the combination with platinum appears to be similar to the activity of singleagent cetuximab (response rate, 6%–20%).74,75
Cetuximab also has been investigated as part of
front-line regimens for metastatic SCCHN. In a phase
3 study, 117 patients with metastatic SCCHN who
received no prior treatment for metastatic disease
were randomized to receive either cisplatin 100 mg/
m2 4 times per week or same-dose cisplatin plus
cetuximab (400 mg/m2 on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and
250 mg/m2 per week thereafter). Secondary endpoints in that ECOG study included ORR, OS, toxicity, and EGFR correlation with clinical endpoints.
Response significantly improved in the combination
group (26% vs 10%; P 5 .03); however, PFS and OS
were not statistically different. The median PFS was
2.7 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.9–
3.8) for patients who received cisplatin only and
4.2 months (95% CI, 3.71–5.55; P 5 .09) for patients
who received cisplatin plus cetuximab. An MS of
8 months (95% CI, 6.1–10.6 months) was observed in
the control group, and an MS of 9.2 months (95% CI,
7.1-12.1 months) was observed in the cisplatin plus
cetuximab arm (P 5 .21). Unfortunately, that study
was underpowered; a higher patient number would
have been required for the study to meet its endpoints. Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 90% of
patients who received cetuximab and in 73% of
patients who received cisplatin only. Patients who
received the combination treatment had a higher
rate of hematologic toxicity.76
More definitive findings to date have come from
a recently completed phase 3 trial—the Erbitux in
First-line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Head
and Neck Cancer (EXTREME) trial—which randomized 442 patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN
to receive either combined cisplatin (or carboplatin)
plus 5-FU and cetuximab (first dose, 400 mg/m2;
then, 250 mg/m2 per week), or identical CT without
cetuximab. Preliminary results indicate a significant

2639

OS benefit by adding cetuximab, with an MS of 7.4
months versus 10.1 months in the CT-alone arm versus the CT plus cetuximab arm, respectively (P 5
.036)—among the longest median survivals ever
reported in a phase 3 trial for these patients. The
most relevant toxicities were hematologic events and,
as expected, the presence of rash in patients who
received cetuximab. Analysis of secondary endpoints
is ongoing.77

TKIs
Locally advanced disease
Small-molecule TKIs act by binding the adenosine
triphosphate pocket within the kinase domain of the
EGFR and impairing its catalytic activity. Their antitumor activity in SCCHN has been demonstrated in
several preclinical studies.78–80 Gefitinib has been
investigated in different clinical SCCHN settings; and
as maintenance therapy after CRT for patients with
LA disease, gefitinib seems to be a feasible
approach.81 A phase 2 trial of gefitinib plus induction
CT (ie, combined docetaxel, carboplatin, and 5-FU)
and CRT for the treatment of LA/unresectable disease resulted in 11 CRs (32%), 18 PRs (53%), and
5 patients with SD or disease progression (15%). At
median follow-up (7 months), 9 patients (20%) progressed. The 1-year actuarial PFS and OS rates were
68% and 86%, respectively. Grade 3/4 myelosuppression was common, and grade 3/4 mucositis occurred
in all patients during combined-modality therapy.
Adding gefitinib did not substantially increase toxicity, but 1 treatment-related death occurred.82 Two
other TKIs—erlotinib and lapatinib (GlaxoSmithKline,
Research Triangle Park, NC)—have been studied in
combination with cisplatin-based CRT in phase 1
trials for LA disease. Both were tolerated well.83,84
Erlotinib plus docetaxel and RT similarly was feasible
in a recently reported phase 1 trial.85
Recurrent/metastatic disease
The most studied TKI in recurrent/metastatic
SCCHN is gefitinib, which has been tested as monotherapy both in pretreated patients and in treatmentnaive patients.86–88 After encouraging phase 2
results,89 gefitinib failed to yield a survival benefit in
the Iressa Versus Methotrexate study for patients
who were refractory to platinum therapy.90 In treatment-naive patients, however, in a phase 2 study,
combined gefitinib, docetaxel, and cisplatin produced a 62.5% ORR, a 75% disease-control rate, and
a 5.1-month PFS. Toxicities were those typically
observed with combination CT alone.91 A second trial
that included erlotinib with the same CT combination reported similar efficacy as front-line treatment

2640

for recurrent/metastatic SCCHN (ORR, 67%; diseasecontrol rate, 95%; median PFS, 6.01 months; median
OS, 11 months). Adding erlotinib did not increase
the expected toxicity of docetaxel or cisplatin. Grade
3/4 neutropenia was the most frequent severe event
(in 6 patients); other grade 3/4 adverse events
included dehydration (4 patients), diarrhea (3
patients), and gastrointestinal bleeding (2 patients).
The most common grade 1/2 toxicities were diarrhea, nausea, and rash.92 A small phase 1 study (n 5
19 patients) of the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib combined with gefitinib 500 mg per day
resulted in a 22% PR rate (4 of 18 evaluable patients)
and no dose-limiting toxicities.93 A phase 1/2 study
combining erlotinib (150 mg per day) and the MoAb
bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks; Genentech,
Inc., South San Francisco, Calif) in 45 patients with
metastatic/recurrent SCCHN resulted in 2 CRs, 3 PRs,
and 31 patients with SD. Toxicities included skin rash
(28 of 44 evaluated patients), diarrhea,15 fatigue,21 and
grade 4 hemorrhage in 1 patient.94
A phase 2 study of lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2
kinase inhibitor, enrolled patients who had recurrent/metastatic SCCHN with (n 5 15 patients) and
without (n 5 27 patients) previous exposure to
EGFRIs. All patients received lapatinib 1500 mg per
day. No ORs were observed in either arm. In an
intent-to-treat analysis, SD was the best response
observed in 37% of patients without previous EGFR
exposure and in 20% of previously treated patients.
Toxicity generally was mild, and there were no dose
reductions or patient withdrawals. Diarrhea (40% of
patients) was the most common toxicity.95

Antiangiogenesis With Bevacizumab
Tumors stimulate the abnormal development of
blood vessels to support their own growth, and the
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced
by tumors may play an essential role in angiogenesis.96 Bevacizumab is an anti-VEGF, humanized
MoAb that inhibits growth of new tumor blood vessels and normalizes tumor vasculature.97 It has been
proposed that bevacizumab may reduce new tumor
blood vessel formation and also normalize existing
vessels, thereby boosting drug delivery when used in
combination with cytotoxics.98 Bevacizumab is effective in mCRC, breast cancer, and NSCLC99–101 and
now is approved by the FDA for use in patients with
CRC and NSCLC.
The combination of bevacizumab plus erlotinib
is under investigation for treating metastatic SCCHN,
as discussed above. Another ongoing trial is investigating bevacizumab plus cetuximab in metastatic
disease. Combined bevacizumab plus CRT also is

part of an ongoing RTOG-sponsored study in
patients with LA nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Enrolled
patients receive standard RT and cisplatin every
3 weeks in combination with bevacizumab followed
by ‘‘consolidation’’ with 5-FU, cisplatin, and bevacizumab for 3 cycles.73

Applying Trial Findings to Clinical Practice
Although it has been demonstrated that CRT with
high-dose cisplatin is superior to RT alone in clinical
trials,18–20,102 the aggressiveness and toxicity of cisplatin-based CRT leads many practitioners to use
relatively less toxic regimens that have not necessarily been validated in randomized clinical trials. In a
recent survey of treatment patterns in community
and academic centers, 38% of patients with LA disease who were treated with CRT received singleagent cisplatin (within this group, 58% received lowdose cisplatin). Twenty-two percent of patients
received carboplatin/paclitaxel, 18% received cisplatin/5-FU, and 5.5% received single-agent carboplatin.102 Trial results now support the addition of
targeted therapies to this array of treatment options.
With their relatively milder toxicity profile, targeted
molecular therapies are an appealing therapeutic
choice for treating a disease in which therapy-related
toxicity and patient compliance are relevant concerns.
The phase 3 trial of cetuximab plus RT,69 as
proof of principle, was the first instance of a targeted
agent garnering approval on the basis of its interaction with definitive RT. In so doing, cetuximab has
yielded a meaningful advance in the management of
LA SCCHN, although the combination with RT has
not yet been compared directly with the current
standard, CRT. Nonetheless, the trial design allowed
several radiation schedules, facilitating the projection
of its results into standard practice settings. Most
patients were treated with concomitant-boost radiation, reflecting current practice patterns among
radiation oncologists. The efficacy observed with
cetuximab plus RT is the most striking finding of this
trial, because the therapeutic benefits observed with
the combination were not only statistically significant but clinically meaningful. It is also important to
note that, apart from the expected increase in dermatologic toxicity, cetuximab plus RT did not exacerbate mucositis or other relevant toxicities, nor was
there substantial impact on planned RT delivery. Toxicity associated with CRT may impose delays/interruptions in RT delivery, which often have a well
documented negative impact on RT efficacy.103,104
Incorporating targeted therapies, and cetuximab in
particular, into this paradigm potentially may
improve current rates of RT delivery, particularly

Targeted Therapy in Head & Neck Cancer/Langer

among patients who are at risk for more severe toxicity. Improved short- and long-term tolerability also
may reduce the need for major supportive measures,
such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)
placement, which is often the source of further complications.105 With these considerations in mind, targeted
therapies provide more options for individualized
treatment. Cetuximab plus RT has already been
adopted as a therapeutic alternative for patients who
have LA disease and compromised performance status
or for whom CRT delivery may be particularly problematic; until now, those populations often were
undertreated or were treated with RT alone. The wider
role of cetuximab as part of CRT regimens (either concomitant or as maintenance) will be shaped by
ongoing trial results.
In the metastatic setting, the results of the phase
2 trial led by Vermorken et al. are among the best
reported for the platinum-refractory patient population and represent a benchmark for future therapeutic developments. With all of the caveats of a
noncomparative study, the survival observed appears
to be superior to historic reports, and single-agent
cetuximab can be considered the standard for this
patient population. These results in previously treated patients and the positive trends observed in the
front-line setting provide a solid rationale for the
investigation of cetuximab as a first-line agent in
combination with standard platinum-based treatment. In addition, findings from the EXTREME trial
indicate that adding cetuximab to standard CT can
lead to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful survival benefit, with an MS difference of
2.7 months (10.1 months vs 7.4 months; P 5 .036).
Although full analysis of that trial is ongoing, these
encouraging findings may prompt a reconsideration
of standards of care and propel the incorporation of
platinum/cetuximab combinations into the front-line
treatment of metastatic disease. Panitumumab also is
under investigation in this setting.
Preliminary results obtained with TKIs indicate a
pattern of activity similar to that of cetuximab, at
least in metastatic SCCHN, although TKIs have not
been investigated as extensively. However, it is important to note that, in patients with SCCHN, an
infusional agent may be easier to give, although oral
treatments can be administered by PEG once they
are dissolved in water.
Much remains to be learned regarding the
rational integration of EGFRIs into treatment regimens for SCCHN; ongoing trials will help provide
clinicians with valuable information. The first open
question, which will be addressed by the RTOG-0522
trial, is to determine the role of cetuximab as part of

CRT strategies. Another intriguing strategy is to capitalize on the relative tolerability of these agents to
use them as maintenance therapy, which is the focus
of the nonrandomized ECOG-3303 trial investigating
cetuximab in patients with unresectable tumors.
Incorporating EGFRIs into reirradiation regimens for
patients with locally recurrent disease also should be
explored, because cetuximab plus RT already has
proven its value.
The identification of a predictive marker to help
select patients for treatment with HER1/EGFRIs would
enhance knowledge already derived from completed
and ongoing studies. However, biomarkers for individualizing treatment of SCCHN remain elusive. Screening for chromosomal abnormalities/markers, such as
EGFR, cyclin D1, and p53, have garnered potential interest, but few have been incorporated into clinical
practice. To date, there is no evidence that genetic
screening or biomarkers can assist in selecting treatment, predicting treatment response, or determining
clinical outcome in patients with SCCHN.106

Conclusion
Recent progress in the treatment of SCCHN is evident. Current outcomes, however, particularly in the
advanced-disease setting, still require more effective
approaches. SCCHN treatment designs must consider
achievable therapeutic goals at various disease stages
(Table 3). For LA disease, CRT and altered fractionation RT have helped to improve survival and to
increase locoregional control, but increased acute
grade 3/4 toxicities limit their use, particularly in
patients with comorbidities.37
Most recent progress in SCCHN has come from
the developing targeted agents, particularly EGFRIs.

Targeted therapy does not yet have a role in earlystage disease, and its utility in adjuvant therapy is
under study, but cetuximab has provided proof of
principle that a targeted agent can improve survival
and locoregional control when added to RT in locoregional SCCHN. Given the tolerability profile of
cetuximab in LA disease, it is often considered a
standard approach for patients with compromised
performance status or significant comorbidities that
preclude platinum-based therapy; its role in aggressive, concurrent CRT regimens still is under evaluation. Its effectiveness in second-line treatment for
recurrent/metastatic SCCHN makes cetuximab a
standard in that setting; and the benefits observed in
the EXTREME trial in combination with standard
platinum regimens suggest a critical role in the firstline, metastatic/recurrent setting.8,42,69,74,76,77,107,108
The anticancer activity of anti-EGFR TKIs as well as
bevacizumab in several SCCHN populations also currently is being studied.
