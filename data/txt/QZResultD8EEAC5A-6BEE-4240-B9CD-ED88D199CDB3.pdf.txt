Abstract
A major drawback of cancer chemotherapy is the lack of
tumor-specific targets which would allow for the selective
eradication of malignant cells without affecting healthy
tissues. In contrast with normal cells, most tumor cells
contain multiple centrosomes, associated with the formation
of multipolar mitotic spindles and chromosome segregation
defects. Many tumor cells regain mitotic stability after clonal
selection by the coalescence of multiple centrosomes into two
functional spindle poles. To overcome the limitations of
current cancer treatments, we have developed a cell-based
screening strategy to identify small molecules that inhibit
centrosomal clustering and thus force tumor cells with
supernumerary centrosomes to undergo multipolar mitoses,
and subsequently, apoptosis. Using a chemotaxonomic selection of fungi from a large culture collection, a relatively small
but diverse natural product extract library was generated.
Screening of this compound library led to the identification of
griseofulvin, which induced multipolar spindles by inhibition
of centrosome coalescence, mitotic arrest, and subsequent cell
death in tumor cell lines but not in diploid fibroblasts and
keratinocytes with a normal centrosome content. The inhibition of centrosome clustering by griseofulvin was not restricted to mitotic cells but did occur during interphase as well.
Whereas the formation of multipolar spindles was dyneinindependent, depolymerization of interphase microtubules
seemed to be mechanistically involved in centrosomal
declustering. In summary, by taking advantage of the tumorspecific phenotype of centrosomal clustering, we have developed a screening strategy that might lead to the identification
of drugs which selectively target tumor cells and spare healthy
tissues. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6342–50]

Introduction
Centrosomes are small cytoplasmic organelles which consist of a
pair of centrioles embedded in pericentriolar material and act as
microtubule organizing centers (1). During mitosis, centrosomes
function as spindle poles, directing the formation of bipolar

spindles, a process essential for accurate chromosome segregation
(2, 3). Centrosomes duplicate precisely once per cell cycle to assure
spindle bipolarity, with each daughter cell receiving one centrosome upon cytokinesis.
Centrosome amplification has been frequently observed in both
solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, and is linked to
tumorigenesis and aneuploidy (4–8). The extent of centrosomal
aberrations is correlated with the degree of chromosomal instability and clinical aggressiveness of the malignant neoplasias
(9–12). In mitosis, supernumerary centrosomes can lead to the
formation of multipolar spindles which are responsible for
chromosome malsegregation with subsequent aneuploidy and
which can be found in many tumor types (5). Multipolar spindles,
however, are antagonistic to cell viability. Most progeny derived
from a defective mitosis will undergo apoptosis, but few daughter
cells, receiving the appropriate chromosome complement and
gene dosage, will survive and contribute, via clonal selection, to a
population of aneuploid tumor cells. The survivors, however, must
overcome the condition of supernumerary centrosomes in order to
divide efficiently. To regain secondary karyotype stability, many
tumor cells have developed a mechanism termed centrosomal
clustering that prevents the formation of multipolar spindles by
coalescence of multiple centrosomes into two functional spindle
poles (13–15).
Centrosome positioning in the center of interphase cells is
accomplished by pulling forces applied to microtubules by dynein,
which serves to keep the centrosome away from the cell margin,
and microtubule pushing by actomyosin-driven forces directed
toward the cell center (16). Several pieces of evidence suggest that
the minus end–directed microtubule motor protein dynein is
involved in microtubule minus end–bundling for the establishment
of bipolar spindles (17–19). A current model suggests that the
function of dynein to tether spindle pole microtubules into bundles
requires NuMA, which might use the motor activity of dynein to
become localized to centrosomes (20). At the spindle poles, it forms
a matrix to hold microtubule minus ends together. Analogous, in
cells with multiple centrosomes, centrosomal clustering seems to
be mediated by dynein (14). Recent data show that only cells with
spindle-associated dynein were capable of coalescing multiple
centrosomes into two spindle poles. Spindle multipolarity, on the
other hand, was found to follow the overexpression of NuMA which
interferes with the spindle localization of dynein (14). With the
exception of the involvement of dynein and NuMA, the molecular
mechanisms responsible for clustering of multiple centrosomes
into two spindle poles of tumor cells are unknown.
The only known small molecules that specifically affect the
mitotic machinery target either tubulin (21) or the plus end–
directed motor protein Eg5, a mitotic kinesin required for spindle
bipolarity (22). Whereas Vinca alkaloids and taxanes disrupt

spindle function by inhibiting or increasing microtubule polymerization, inhibition of Eg5 activity by monastrol leads to impaired
microtubule-dependent centrosome separation and formation of
monopolar spindles. Both Vinca alkaloids and taxanes are used as
anticancer drugs and Eg5 is currently evaluated as a potential
target for antineoplastic drug development (23). However, neither
microtubule poisoning nor Eg5 inhibition selectively affects tumor
cells, explaining the side effects and dose limitations of antimitotic
drugs in clinical use.
Supernumerary centrosomes almost exclusively occur in a wide
variety of neoplastic disorders but not in nontransformed cells.
Therefore, inhibition of centrosomal clustering with consequential
induction of multipolar spindles and subsequent cell death would
specifically target tumor cells with no effect on normal cells with a
regular centrosome content. To identify cell-permeable small molecules that inhibit centrosomal clustering in cells with supernumerary centrosomes, we developed a cell-based screening strategy
founded on the visualization of microtubules and chromatin.
Natural products have proved to be rich sources of novel anticancer lead compounds during the past 20 years (24). Therefore,
we decided to screen a fungal extract library for compounds inhibiting centrosomal clustering. The fungal extracts were selected
based on a chemotaxonomic screening approach (25), in order
to increase the chemodiversity to be tested. An initial screening
effort using extracts from different Penicillium species led to the
identification of griseofulvin as an inhibitor of centrosome
coalescence in several different tumor cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. All cell lines were cultured in DMEM (PAA Laboratories)
supplemented with 10% FCS (PAA Laboratories). UPCI:SCC114 (SCC114)
cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)–a-tubulin were
generated by transfection (Fugene 6, Roche Diagnostics) of the transgene in
pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and maintained under selective pressure by the
addition of geniticin (Invitrogen). Primary normal human epidermal
keratinocytes (NHEK; PromoCell) were cultured in Keratinocyte Growth
Medium 2 (PromoCell). When indicated, griseofulvin (Sigma) was added to
the culture medium. Griseofulvin was dissolved in DMSO (Sigma). In all
experiments, the final DMSO concentration was 0.1%.
Preparation of fungal extracts. For fungal strains, preparation of fungal
extracts, fractionation of fungal extracts, isolation of pure compounds,
identification of griseofulvin by high-performance liquid chromatography–
diode array detection–mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS), and synthesis
of griseofulvin derivatives, full experimental details can be found in the
supplementary information accompanying this article.
Antibodies. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal
antibodies to Eg5 (Transduction Laboratories), a-tubulin (DM1A), g-tubulin
(GTU-88; Sigma), y-tubulin (A1), q-tubulin (H280), PARP (F-2; Santa Cruz),
dynein light intermediate chain (Chemicon International), and NuMA
(Calbiochem); rabbit polyclonal antibodies to g-tubulin, centrin (Sigma),
pericentrin (Covance), actin (I-19; Santa Cruz), and phospho-S10-histone H3
(Upstate Biotechnology). A mouse monoclonal antibody to centrin and a
rabbit polyclonal antibody to c-Nap1 were kindly provided by J.L. Salisbury
and E.A. Nigg, respectively.
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence staining was done as
described (26). The following fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were used: anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) and
anti-mouse Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Immunostained
cells were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope.
Images were processed with Photoshop software (Adobe).
Time-lapse video microscopy. For live-cell imaging, GFP-a-tubulin
expressing SCC114 cells were grown in CO2-independent Leibovitz medium
(Life Technologies, Invitrogen) on plastic dishes (A-dishes, Ibidi). Live-cell

imaging was carried out using a Nikon TE2000-U inverted microscope
equipped with differential interference contrast optics and an Orca AG
camera (Hamamatsu), driven by NIS-Element AR software (Nikon).
Individual GFP-a-tubulin expressing cells containing bipolar or multipolar
spindles were detected by immunofluorescence and followed using
differential interference contrast imaging.
Flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry including the
quantification of cells in mitosis by phospho-S10-histone H3 staining was
done as previously described (27).
Colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (tetrazolium) assay. The cytotoxicity assay was done as previously described (28).
Isolation and analysis of human centrosomes. Centrosomes from
SCC114 cells were isolated as previously described (26, 29).
Measurement of Annexin V–positive cells. Phosphatidylserine externalization was analyzed using the Apoptosis Detection Kit I from Becton
Dickinson according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.

Results
Screening procedure for the identification of small molecules that inhibit centrosomal clustering. To identify small
molecules that inhibit centrosome coalescence and thereby induce
multipolar mitoses, we first generated SCC114 cells that stably
express GFP-a-tubulin (Supplementary Fig. S1A). SCC114 is an oral
squamous cell carcinoma cell line showing pronounced centrosomal clustering (14). Despite the presence of supernumerary
centrosomes in 64.5% of SCC114 cells as detected by immunostaining against centrin and g-tubulin, only 3.6% of the cells in mitosis
harbored multipolar spindles (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C).
Because 13.6% of exponentially growing, unmanipulated SCC114
cells were in mitosis, sufficient mitotic cells for the evaluation of
the spindle polarity status were available. GFP-a-tubulin expressing
SCC114 cells were grown in 96-well plates to near-confluence,
treated with Penicillium extracts for 7 h, fixed, and examined by
fluorescence microscopy. Three hundred mitotic cells per well were
analyzed with the percentage of mitotic cells with multipolar
spindles being the read-out. Nine 4-fold dilutions of each extract,
covering a final concentration range from micromolar to nanomolar were analyzed. On each plate, three wells were treated with
DMSO only to generate a control population. Experiments were
done twice in parallel to provide a replicate data set. Extracts
producing a significant increase in the percentage of multipolar
mitoses were fractionated by HPLC into 24 fractions each.
Subsequently, all fractions were reanalyzed by the screening
procedure described above. In positive fractions, the detection of
compounds eluting from the HPLC column was done by UV
detection and subsequent mass spectrometry. Major compounds in
positive fractions were further purified for retesting using semipreparative HPLC.
Selection of fungal cultures for the natural product extract
library. To generate a natural product compound library
representing a chemodiversity as large as possible, only one or
few fungal strains of the same species should be included. This is
because strains of the same species usually produce very similar
metabolite profiles of up to hundreds of natural products, and
thereby represent the same chemotype (25). For this study, it was
therefore decided to include just two strains of each of the species
that previously had been analyzed and chemotyped by HPLC-DADMS profiling (data not shown).
Identification of griseofulvin from a Penicillium extract
library. Using the screening procedure described here, three
extracts from the fungal extract library were found to induce a

significant increase in the percentage of multipolar mitoses
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Two extracts originated from Penicillium
berlinense (IBT 18288 and 19440), strongly indicating that the
observed activity was due to the same compound(s) in the two
extracts. The third extract originated from Penicillium faroense
(IBT 22543). Therefore, extracts of IBT 18288 and IBT 22543 were
further separated by semipreparative HPLC, and single fractions
from a total of 24 fractions each were shown to account for the
induction of spindle multipolarity (data not shown). Analysis by
HPLC-DAD-MS of the positive fractions, as well as a further
purified fraction (Supplementary Fig. S3), identified griseofulvin as
the active compound.
Induction of multipolar mitoses by griseofulvin. Griseofulvin
(Sigma) induced multipolar mitoses in a concentration-dependent
fashion in four human cancer cell lines, but not in normal
fibroblasts or NHEK (Fig. 1A). After 24 h of treatment with 100
Amol/L of griseofulvin, >86% of mitoses were multipolar in SCC114,

depicted here, virtually all spindle poles in cells with multipolar spindles contained
two centrin signals.

HeLa, U2OS, and MCF7 cells. In contrast, 87% and 82% of mitotic
fibroblasts and NHEK harbored bipolar spindles, respectively. At
20 Amol/L of griseofulvin, multipolar spindles ranged from 20% in
MCF7 cells to 53% in SCC114 cells, whereas in BJ fibroblasts and
NHEK, only 3% and 10% of metaphases were multipolar.
Coimmunostaining of griseofulvin-treated SCC114 cells with antibodies to Eg5 and phospho-S10-histone H3 revealed that virtually
all multipolar cells were indeed mitotic (Fig. 1B). To prove that
each spindle pole in cells with multipolar spindles contains complete centrosomes and not only acentriolar centrosome-related
bodies (30), SCC114 cells stably expressing GFP-a-tubulin were
treated with griseofulvin and immunostained with an antibody to
centrin as a centriolar marker. Almost all spindle poles in cells with
multipolar spindles contained two centrin signals, clearly indicating that each spindle pole consists of a complete centrosome
(Fig. 1C).
Induction of mitotic cell cycle arrest by griseofulvin. To
examine the effect of multipolar mitosis induction on cell cycle
progression, griseofulvin-treated cells were stained with propidium
iodide and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. Treatment
with griseofulvin induced a concentration-dependent G2-M cell
cycle arrest in all cell lines examined (Fig. 2A, top; Supplementary
Table S1). However, whereas 91.2 F 3.9% and 65.6 F 7.6% of
SCC114 and HeLa cells were arrested in G2-M phase, respectively,
only 19.1 F 3.8% of BJ fibroblasts were in G2-M phase at 24 h after
treatment with 20 Amol/L of griseofulvin. To discriminate between
cell cycle arrest in G2 and M phases of the cell cycle, cells were
immunostained with an antibody to phospho-S10-histone H3 as
mitosis marker (27, 31). Two-variable flow cytometry analysis
revealed that treatment with 35 Amol/L of griseofulvin induced an
increase in the percentage of mitotic cells and a corresponding
gradual decrease in the percentage of cells in G1, S, and G2 phases
of the cell cycle (Fig. 2A, bottom). Whereas the percentage of
SCC114 and HeLa cells in mitosis increased from 15.0 F 8.9% and
4.0% prior to griseofulvin treatment to 67.3 F 8.3% and 35.6% at
24 h, respectively, only 5.5% of BJ fibroblasts were in mitosis
24 h after 35 Amol/L of griseofulvin as compared with 4.1% prior
to treatment. Importantly, the ability of griseofulvin to induce a
G2-M arrest closely paralleled its capacity to induce multipolar
spindles (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Inhibition of cell proliferation by griseofulvin. Next, we
determined the ability of griseofulvin to inhibit cell proliferation
in cancer cell lines and normal BJ fibroblasts. Again, the effect of
griseofulvin on proliferation closely paralleled its ability to induce
multipolar spindles and mitotic cell cycle arrest as shown in Figs. 1A
and 2A. Griseofulvin inhibited cell growth in a concentrationdependent manner, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at
35 Amol/L in SCC114 cells and 75 Amol/L in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B).
In BJ fibroblasts, even the highest griseofulvin concentration used
(100 Amol/L) led to only 38 F 1% growth inhibition. Thus,
concentrations needed for the induction of both multipolar spindles
and mitotic cell cycle arrest by griseofulvin correlate well with its
ability to inhibit proliferation in SCC114. Normal fibroblasts, on the
other hand, were less sensitive to griseofulvin-induced cytotoxicity,
paralleling our findings with multipolar spindle induction and
mitotic cell cycle arrest.
Induction of apoptosis by griseofulvin. Griseofulvin seemed to
induce apoptosis in SCC114 as indicated by the detection of a subG1 peak by flow cytometry after 48 h of treatment (data not
shown). Cell lysates were prepared from SCC114 cells treated with
35 Amol/L of griseofulvin and were evaluated for the induction of

35 Amol/L for SCC114 cells and 75 Amol/L for HeLa cells. For BJ fibroblasts,
the IC50 was not reached at the highest griseofulvin concentration used
(100 Amol/L).

apoptosis by detection of the p85 fragment of PARP, a downstream
target of activated caspase 3. PARP cleavage was detected at
24 h and strongly increased at 48 h (Fig. 3A). In addition,
phosphatidylserine externalization was measured by Annexin V
staining as another variable of apoptosis. In contrast to mocktreated SCC114 cells, 70.95 F 0.39% of the cells treated with
35 Amol/L of griseofulvin stained positive for Annexin V after
48 h of incubation (Fig. 3B). To show that cells treated with
griseofulvin do indeed die because of multipolar spindle formation,
we examined the effect of griseofulvin on the fate of bipolar versus
multipolar live SCC114 cells. Continuous time-lapse video microscopy of SCC114 cells treated with 35 Amol/L of griseofulvin

www.aacrjournals.org

revealed that 12 out of 15 cells (80%) containing multipolar
spindles died after prolonged mitosis by apoptotic blebbing
(Fig. 3C, top). In contrast, only one out of five (20%) SCC114 cells
with a bipolar spindle examined eventually exited from mitosis
despite the continuous presence of griseofulvin (Fig. 3C, bottom).
This difference was statistically significant (t test; P = 0.009).
Griseofulvin inhibits centrosome coalescence in interphase
cells. Like SCC114 cells, N115 mouse neuroblastoma cells contain
large numbers of centrioles, and yet undergo mostly bipolar
divisions (5, 13, 15). In these cells, multiple centrioles aggregate to
single, unusually large ‘‘compound’’ centrosomes during interphase
(Fig. 4A). To examine whether the inhibition of centrosomal
clustering is mitosis-specific or also occurs in interphase cells,
both mock- and griseofulvin-treated interphase N115 cells were
immunostained for g-tubulin. Analogous to mitotic cells, griseofulvin led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of centrosome
coalescence in interphase cells (Fig. 4A and B). After 24 h of
treatment with 50 Amol/L of griseofulvin, 68 F 1.5% of N115 cells
lacked clustering of centrioles. Instead, centrosomes were found
to be dispersed all over the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B).
To evaluate whether the inhibition of centrosomal clustering
in interphase cells was caused by the destruction of the
microtubule network, both mock- and griseofulvin-treated interphase N115 cells were immunostained for a-tubulin. Griseofulvin
inhibited the orderly formation of interphase microtubules in a
concentration-dependent manner. Whereas a less severe phenotype with dispersion of multiple centrosomes within a single
perinuclear a-tubulin meshwork predominated at lower griseofulvin concentrations (Fig. 4C and D), higher concentrations resulted
in widely separated centrosomes leading to multiple microtubule
nucleation sites with short and convoluted microtubules. Furthermore, a nuclear enlargement of cells treated with griseofulvin was
observed even though the DNA content, as analyzed by flow
cytometry, was not increased as compared with untreated control
cells (Fig. 4A; data not shown).
Griseofulvin depletes neither cytoplasmic dynein nor NuMA
from the mitotic spindle. Recently, it was proposed that
overcoming centrosomal clustering involved the dissociation of
cytoplasmic dynein from the mitotic spindle (14). In addition,
overexpression of NuMA has been described to induce spindle
multipolarity via delocalization of dynein from the spindle (14). To
determine the localization of dynein and NuMA, both mock- and
griseofulvin-treated SCC114 cells were immunostained for dynein
and NuMA (Fig. 5A and B). In mock-treated samples, 99.5 F 0.5%
and 100% of the bipolar spindles were decorated with dynein and
NuMA, respectively. However, a virtually identical percentage (99 F
1% and 99.5 F 0.5%) of multipolar spindles from SCC114 cells treated
with 100 Amol/L of griseofulvin were intensely labeled with
antibodies to dynein and NuMA. In addition, neither dynein nor
NuMA protein levels changed after a 24-h treatment of SCC114
cells with 35 Amol/L of griseofulvin (IC50) as determined by Western
blot analysis (data not shown). Also, when dynein activity was
blocked by the addition of 500 Amol/L of orthovanadate, multipolar
spindle induction in SCC114 cells by 35 Amol/L of griseofulvin was
not inhibited (data not shown).
Griseofulvin does not affect major centrosome constituents.
To evaluate whether the inhibition of centrosomal clustering by
griseofulvin was caused by interference with core centrosomal
proteins, centrosomal extracts were prepared from both mock- and
griseofulvin-treated SCC114 cells (26, 29). The levels and mobilities
of centrin, c-Nap1, y-tubulin, and q-tubulin remained unchanged

when assayed by immunoblotting in centrosomal extract preparations after 24 h of incubation with 35 Amol/L of griseofulvin
(Fig. 5C). Pericentrin and g-tubulin levels increased slightly after
griseofulvin treatment.
2¶-substituted derivatives of griseofulvin have an enhanced
capacity for multipolar mitosis induction. Recently, it has been
described that 2¶-substituted derivatives of griseofulvin display a
stronger inhibitory activity on microtubule formation as compared
with griseofulvin itself (32). To gain insight into the mechanism of
multipolar spindle formation by griseofulvin, we synthesized
griseofulvin derivatives with different 2¶-substitutions (Fig. 6A).
Whereas side chain elongation led to increased multipolar spindle
formation with 2¶-demethoxy-2¶-propoxygriseofulvin (compound 5)
being the most active compound and approximately 10 times more
potent than griseofulvin itself, reduction of the 2¶-substituent to a
keto group completely abolished the activity (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
The overall goal of the study presented here has been to
identify small molecules that induce the formation of multipolar
spindles by the inhibition of centrosomal clustering in cells with
supernumerary centrosomes. For that, we have developed a cellbased screening strategy employing squamous cell carcinoma cells
which harbor extra copies of centrosomes and nevertheless divide
in a strictly bipolar manner as a model system (14). Bipolar spindle
formation in tumor cells is accomplished by the coalescence of

multiple centrosomes into two spindle poles (13, 14). Because
multipolar spindles do not alert the spindle checkpoint controlling
the exit from mitosis (33) but aberrant cell divisions provoke
apoptotic cell death (34, 35), we have speculated that interference
with mechanisms leading to centrosomal clustering will force
tumor cells with supernumerary centrosomes to undergo multipolar mitoses and consequently apoptosis.
Using a fungal extract library, this approach led to the identification of griseofulvin from three independent Penicillium
extracts. Griseofulvin induced multipolar spindles by the inhibition
of centrosome coalescence, mitotic arrest, and subsequent cell
death in several tumor cell lines but not in normal fibroblasts.
The mechanism of action seems to be the disruption of the
interphase microtubule network by inhibition of microtubule
polymerization, resulting in the dispersion of supernumerary
centrosomes throughout the cytoplasm.
Griseofulvin, an orally active, nontoxic antifungal drug derived
from several species of Penicillium, has been used for many years
for the treatment of tinea capitis and other dermatophyte
infections (36, 37). Early studies showed that griseofulvin inhibits
mitosis in sensitive fungi in a manner resembling the actions of
colchicine (21). The antiproliferative and antimitotic effects of
griseofulvin in mammalian cells are weak, with inhibition requiring micromolar concentrations (38, 39). The question of whether
inhibition of mitosis by griseofulvin involves microtubule depolymerization or some other action on microtubules in human cells
has remained unsettled. Although griseofulvin is able to bind to

mammalian brain tubulin and is able to inhibit the polymerization
of microtubules in vitro, conflicting results regarding its ability to
interfere with the cytoplasmic microtubule network in vivo have
been published (32, 38–41). Depending on the cell lines used, the
griseofulvin concentrations necessary to disrupt microtubules
ranged between 10 and 100 Amol/L. Comparable concentrations
of griseofulvin led to mitotic arrest in several cell lines.
We have found that the griseofulvin concentrations necessary for
the induction of multipolar spindles are similar to those required
for the inhibition of mitosis and cell proliferation, suggesting that
multipolar spindles lead to aberrant cell divisions and subsequent
cell death. As a direct proof of this concept, we were able to show
that griseofulvin-induced cytotoxicity was limited to cells with
multipolar spindles; however, cells with bipolar spindles, despite
experiencing a prolonged mitosis, eventually divide and survive in
the presence of griseofulvin.
Multipolar mitosis induction by griseofulvin might be related to
an effect seen with low concentrations of microtubule-stabilizing
antimitotic drugs like paclitaxel, epothilone B, and discodermolide

(42). Analogous to our results with griseofulvin, the drug concentrations required for growth inhibition with paclitaxel and
discodermolide were close to the concentrations necessary for the
induction of multipolar mitoses. In contrast to microtubulestabilizing agents, microtubule-destabilizing drugs like vinblastine,
colchicine, and nocodazole have been found to be unable to induce
multipolar mitoses (42). Although griseofulvin formally belongs to
the group of microtubule-destabilizing agents, we have shown here
that it leads to a prominent induction of multipolar spindles.
If griseofulvin induces multipolar mitoses by inhibition of
centrosomal clustering in tumor cells with supernumerary
centrosomes, then no such effect should be seen in healthy cells
with a normal centrosome content. In keeping with this prediction,
griseofulvin did not induce multipolar cell divisions in normal
fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Importantly, as compared with the
tumor cell lines examined, the griseofulvin concentrations required
to kill fibroblasts were considerably higher. Nevertheless, similar
concentrations of the drug induced a G2-M phase arrest in both
tumor cell lines and fibroblasts. These data support the recent

suggestion that the mechanism underlying aberrant mitosis may
not be the same as that responsible for mitotic blockage, and that
the former determines the sensitivity of cells to griseofulvin and
paclitaxel-like drugs (42).
Supernumerary centrosomes in tumor cells are usually found in
close proximity to each other during interphase and become
separated to form multipolar spindles only at the onset of mitosis
(13). The mechanisms that hold multiple interphase centrosomes
together but allow for the formation of multipolar spindles in late
G2 phase are largely unknown but might be analogous to those
controlling centrosome positioning in normal cells with two
centrosomes (16). Drugs that interfere with centrosome coalescence might exert their action either during interphase or
specifically in cells approaching mitosis. Interestingly, inhibition
of centrosome clustering by griseofulvin was not restricted to
mitotic cells but did occur during interphase as well. As microtubules are critically involved in the positioning of centrosomes
at the center of interphase cells and griseofulvin binds to tubulin
in vitro, we reasoned that the declustering of multiple centrosomes
was caused by the destruction of the interphase microtubule
network. In keeping with this assumption, we found that
griseofulvin led to a concentration-dependent disruption of
interphase microtubules, with dispersion of centrosomes within a
single perinuclear a-tubulin mass at lower concentrations and

completely disorganized, short, and convoluted microtubules
surrounding widely separated centrosomes at higher concentrations. Importantly, the griseofulvin concentrations necessary for
the disruption of interphase microtubules were similar to those
needed for loss of interphase centrosomal clustering on one hand
and the induction of multipolar spindles on the other hand. These
findings suggest that in tumor cells with multiple centrosomes,
induction of multipolar mitoses by griseofulvin was brought about
by the suppression of centrosome coalescence via disruption of the
interphase microtubule network. In further support of this
hypothesis, we found that 2¶-demethoxy-2¶-propoxygriseofulvin, a
griseofulvin analogue which has recently been reported to display a
stronger inhibitory activity on microtubule formation as compared
with griseofulvin itself (32), was also significantly more active with
regard to the induction of multipolar spindle formation.
Although binding of griseofulvin to both the a- and h-subunits of
mammalian brain tubulin has been described (43), its mechanism
of interaction with tubulin is still poorly understood. Interactions
of microtubule-targeted drugs with centrosome-specific forms of
tubulin like g-, y-, and q-tubulin have long been debated (21, 42).
Because paclitaxel induces multipolar mitoses similar to griseofulvin and has been reported to preferentially bind to centrosomes
(44), interference with centrosomal tubulins may be an additional
mechanism responsible for the inhibition of centrosomal clustering

q-tubulin. Centrin was used as a loading control and to show the enrichment of centrosomes in centrosomal preparations as compared with whole cell lysates.

Griseofulvin Inhibits Centrosomal Clustering

in cells with supernumerary centrosomes. However, we did not find
a significant impairment of centrosome assembly by griseofulvin.
The levels and mobilities of major centrosomal constituents
including centrin, c-Nap1, y-tubulin, and q-tubulin, representing
components of centrioles, pericentriolar matrix, and centriolar
linker structures remained completely unchanged when assayed by
immunoblotting in centrosomal extract preparations. Pericentrin
and g-tubulin levels slightly increased after griseofulvin treatment,
fitting to the mitotic recruitment of these proteins to each
individual spindle pole (45). Therefore, although not completely
excluded, interference of griseofulvin with centrosome assembly
seems unlikely.
Recently, the microtubule-associated proteins NuMA and dynein
have been implicated as a critical part of the centrosomecoalescing machinery in cells with amplified centrosomes (14).

www.aacrjournals.org

Overexpression of NuMA has been described to perturb the ability
of tumor cells to coalesce supernumerary centrosomes into a
bipolar spindle (14). This effect seems to be mediated by delocalization of the motor protein dynein from the mitotic spindle as a
prerequisite of multipolar spindle formation (14). In contrast to
these findings, the induction of multipolar spindles by griseofulvin
was not associated with the depletion of dynein or NuMA from the
mitotic spindle or with changes in the expression levels of these
proteins. Also, the inhibition of dynein activity by orthovanadate
did not diminish the capacity of griseofulvin to induce multipolar
spindles. Together with our observation that inhibition of centrosomal clustering by griseofulvin was not restricted to mitotic cells
but could be observed in interphase cells as well, these data argue
for a mechanism of multipolar spindle formation that is independent from spindle-associated dynein.
In view of its ability to stabilize microtubule dynamics and to
inhibit microtubule polymerization in human cells, it is remarkable
that griseofulvin is well-tolerated when given to humans for the
treatment of fungal infections. However, in vitro griseofulvin
induces numerous chromosomal aberrations in all the systems
analyzed (36). In mice and rats, prolonged treatment with
griseofulvin provoked the development of multiple hepatomas
(36). Of note, in adult rats and mice, f90% of hepatocytes were
polyploid (46). In these animals, mononuclear 4N hepatocytes arise
from binuclear hepatocytes via clustering pairs of centrosomes at
opposing spindle poles and subsequent progression through a
bipolar mitosis (46). From this, aneuploidy induction and
formation of hepatocarcinomas would be predicted based on the
ability of griseofulvin to prevent centrosomal clustering and to
induce multipolar cell divisions. Apart from considerably shorter
treatment times, another reason for the lack of hepatocarcinoma
induction by griseofulvin in man might be the comparatively low
number of polyploid cells (20–30%) in the adult human liver (46).
In summary, by taking advantage of the tumor-specific
phenotype of centrosomal clustering and a chemotaxonomic
approach for maximization of chemodiversity to be tested, we
have developed a combined screening strategy that might lead to
the identification of new drugs which selectively target tumor cells
and spare healthy tissues. The identification of griseofulvin from
three independent Penicillium extracts proves the effectiveness of
the cell-based screening strategy described here. Together with a
recent report indicating that griseofulvin, either alone or in
combination with nocodazole, inhibits tumor formation in nude
mice (47), and in view of its lack of significant toxicity in humans,
the data presented here supports the notion that griseofulvin might
be useful for the treatment of cancer.
