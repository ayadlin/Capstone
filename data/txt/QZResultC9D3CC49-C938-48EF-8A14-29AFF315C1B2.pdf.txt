Comprehensive genomic characterization of head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas
The Cancer Genome Atlas Network *

Abstract
Author Manuscript

The Cancer Genome Atlas profiled 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) to
provide a comprehensive landscape of somatic genomic alterations. We find that human
papillomavirus-associated (HPV) tumors are dominated by helicase domain mutations of the
oncogene PIK3CA, novel alterations involving loss of TRAF3, and amplification of the cell cycle
gene E2F1. Smoking-related HNSCCs demonstrate near universal loss of TP53 mutations and
CDKN2A with frequent copy number alterations including a novel amplification of 11q22. A
subgroup of oral cavity tumors with favorable clinical outcomes displayed infrequent CNAs in
conjunction with activating mutations of HRAS or PIK3CA, coupled with inactivating mutations of
CASP8, NOTCH1 and wild-type TP53. Other distinct subgroups harbored novel loss of function
alterations of the chromatin modifier NSD1, Wnt pathway genes AJUBA and FAT1, and activation
of oxidative stress factor NFE2L2, mainly in laryngeal tumors. Therapeutic candidate alterations
were identified in the majority of HNSCC's.

Introduction
HNSCCs impact ~600,000 patients per year worldwide 1. They are characterized by
phenotypic, etiologic, biologic, and clinical heterogeneity. Smoking is implicated in the rise
of HNSCC in developing countries, while the role of HPV is emerging as an important
factor in the rise of oropharyngeal tumors affecting non-smokers in developed countries 2.
Despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, approximately half of all patients will die of
the disease. Risk stratification for HNSCC is by anatomic site, stage, and histologic
characteristics of the tumor. Except for HPV status, numerous molecular and clinical risk
factors that have been investigated have limited clinical utility.

Published genome-wide profiling studies of HNSCC3,4 are limited to single platforms. To
generate an integrated genomic annotation of molecular alterations in HNSCC, The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) has undertaken a comprehensive multi-platform characterization of
500 tumors with the a priori hypothesis of detecting somatic variants present in at least 5%
of samples. Here, we report the results for analyses from the first 279 patients with complete
data.
Samples and Clinical Data
The cohort is comprised primarily of tumors from the oral cavity (n=172/279, 62%),
oropharynx (n=33/279, 12%), and laryngeal sites (n=72/279, 26%) (Section S1, Table S1.1,
Data File S1.1). Most patients were male (n=203/279, 73%) and heavy smokers (mean pack

mapped RNA-Seq reads, primarily aligning to viral genes E6 and E7 (Section S1.2, Figure
S1.1). The HPV status by mapping of RNA-Seq reads was concordant with the genomic,
sequencing, and molecular data and indicated that 36 tumors were HPV(+) and 243 HPV(−).
(Section S1.2, Figure S1.1, Data File S1.2). Of 33 oropharyngeal tumors 64% were positive
for HPV, compared to 6% of 246 non-oropharyngeal tumors. Molecular HPV signatures
were identified using miRNA, DNA methylation, gene expression, and somatic nucleotide
substitutions (Section S1.2, Figures S1.1-S1.3). HPV(+) tumors exhibited infrequent
mutations in TP53 or genetic alterations in CDKN2A. We evaluated outcome by site, stage,
HPV status, molecular subtypes, and putative biomarkers (Section S1.3, Figure S1.4-5).
HPV(+) and interestingly patients with HPV(−), TP53 wild-type tumors demonstrated
favorable outcomes compared to TP53 mutants and 11q13/CCND1 amplified tumors.
DNA and RNA Structural Alterations

Author Manuscript

Most tumors demonstrated copy number alterations (CNAs) including losses of 3p and 8p,
and gains of 3q, 5p, and 8q chromosomal regions (Figures 1A and S2.1, Section S2)
resembling lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSCs) 5 (Figure 1A , S2.1, S2.2). HNSCC
genomes showed high instability with a mean of 141 altered CNAs (amplifications or
deletions) from microarray data and 62 structural aberrations (chromosomal fusions) per
tumor by “high coverage” whole genome sequencing (n=29) (Section S2.2). We observed
39 regions of recurrent copy number (CN) loss and 23 regions of recurrent CN gain (q < 0.1,
Data File S2.1,2). Both HPV(+) and (-) tumors harbored recurrent focal amplifications for
3q26/28, a region involving squamous lineage transcription factors TP63 and SOX2 and the
oncogene PIK3CA (Figures 1B, S2.3).

Author Manuscript

HPV(+) tumors were distinguished by novel recurrent deletions (n=5/36, 14%) and
truncating mutations (n=3/36, 8%) of TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) gene loss
(Figure S2.3,4, Data File S2.1). TRAF3 is implicated in innate and acquired anti-viral
responses 6 including Epstein-Barr, HPV, and HIV 7-9 while loss promotes aberrant NF-κB
signaling 10. While TRAF3 inactivation has been reported in hematologic malignancies and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma 11,12, this is the first evidence linking TRAF3 to HPV-associated
carcinomas. HPV(+) tumors were also notable for focal amplification of E2F1 and an intact
9p21.3 region containing the CDKN2A gene commonly deleted in HPV(−) tumors.

Author Manuscript

HPV(−) tumors featured novel co-amplifications of 11q13 (CCND1, FADD, and CTTN) and
11q22 (BIRC2, YAP1) which also harbor genes implicated in cell death/NF-κB and Hippo
pathways. HPV(−) tumors featured novel focal deletions in the Nuclear Set Domain gene
(NSD1) and tumor suppressor genes (e.g. FAT1, NOTCH1, SMAD4, and CDKN2A; Figure
S2.3). Recurrent focal amplifications in receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGFR, ERBB2 and
FGFR1) also predominated in HPV(−) tumors. Interestingly, unsupervised clustering
analysis of CNAs identified a mutually exclusive subset of predominantly oral cavity tumors
with reduced CNAs, a pattern recently described in cancer as “M” class (tumors driven by
mutation rather than CNA) (Figure 1B) 13. This subset in particular harbored a novel 3 gene
pattern of activating mutations in HRAS, frequently with inactivating CASP8 mutations, and
wild type TP53. We confirmed a previously reported favorable clinical outcome in tumors
with few CNAs 14. The three gene constellation of wild type TP53 with mutant HRAS and

CASP8 suggested an alternative tumorigenesis pathway involving RAS and/or alterations in
cell death/NF-κB 15. Unsupervised analysis also suggested that clustering was a function of
chromosome 7 amplification (including the EGFR locus) in a manner that largely excluded
HPV(+) tumors.

Author Manuscript

To detect additional structural alterations, we interrogated whole genome and RNA-Seq data
(Section S3, Data File S3.1, Figure S3.1). Known fusion oncogenes reported in solid tumors
including those involving the ALK, ROS, or RET genes were not observed in HNSCC.
Previously reported FGFR3-TACC3 fusions 5 were present in two HPV(+) tumors (Figure
S3.2). Only one of 279 patients showed evidence of the vIII isoform of EGFR, previously
described in HNSCC (Figure S3.3) 16. While our investigation did not identify additional
novel oncogenic fusions, several tumors demonstrated exon 1 of EGFR or FGFR3 fused to
non-recurrent partners, suggesting potential promoter swaps for the partner genes (Data File
S3.1). A low prevalence of an alternate MET transcript with skipped exon 14 was identified
in two HPV(−) tumors (Figure S3.4); this finding was reported to be an activating event in
non-small cell lung cancer 17. Structural alterations (homozygous deletions, intra- and interchromosomal fusions) were more commonly associated with loss of function in tumor
suppressor genes, most prominently CDKN2A (Figure S3.5-6), followed by TP53, RB1,
NOTCH1, and FAT1 (Figures S3.7-S3.9) than protein coding fusion events. RNA-Seq data
(Data File S3.3) demonstrated evidence of alterative splicing in genes not previously
described in HNSCC including kallikrein 12 (KLK12) (Figure S3.11), as well as genes such
as TP63 with known importance in HNSCC (Figure S3.12).

Author Manuscript

By DNA analysis, most HPV(+) tumors demonstrated clear evidence of host genome
integration, usually in a single genomic location per sample and almost always in
association with amplifications of the host genome (Figure S3.10, Data File S3.2).
Interrogation of RNA transcripts confirmed transcription across the viral-human integration
locus. However, none of the genes involved were recurrent which suggests a single driver
mechanism related to HPV integration. Similarly, none of the integration sites involved the
MYC gene as reported in HPV(+) cell lines18.
Somatic Mutations

Author Manuscript

Whole exome sequencing identified somatically mutated genes, many located in regions of
CNAs and annotated in the COSMIC database (Figure 2) 19. The mean sequencing coverage
across targeted bases was 95X, with 82% of target bases above 30X coverage. In 279
samples, 12,159 synonymous somatic variants, 37,061 non-synonymous somatic variants,
and 2,579 germline single base substitutions from dbSNP 20 were detected (Section S4).
Targeted re-sequencing of 394 unique regions (Figure S4.1) validated 99% of mutations.
Interrogation of RNA for expression of the mutated alleles confirmed the variant in 86% of
cases (S3.2, Figure S3.1). In contrast to prior reports, the mutation rates did not differ by
HPV status, although transversions at CpG sites were more frequent in HPV(−) tumors and a
predominance of TpCmutations were noted in HPV(+) cases (Figure S1.1) 3. Mutations
were statistically enriched in 11 genes (Figure 2). Among inactivating mutations (premature
termination of the protein by nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations), four genes
segregated exclusively or predominantly in HPV(−) tumors. Two were associated with cell

cycle and survival (CDKN2A (p<0.01) and TP53 (p<0.01)) and two were linked to Wnt/βcatenin signaling (FAT1 (p<0.01) and AJUBA (p=0.14)) 21,22. We observed TP53 mutation
among HPV(−) samples at rates higher (86%) than have been previously reported 23, while
only 1 of 36 HPV(+) cases had a non-synonymous TP53 mutation. Previously unreported
somatic mutations and deletions of AJUBA were primarily 5’ inactivating events and
clustered missense mutations in the functional LIM domain (Figure S4.2). AJUBA is a
centrosomal protein that regulates cell division, vertebrate ciliogenesis, and left-right axis
determination 24. Additionally, AJUBA is subject to EGFR-RAS-MAPK-dependent
phosphorylation and implicated in Hippo growth and regeneration pathways conserved from
Drosophila to mammals 25,26, in ATR-mediated DNA damage response, 27 and tumor
invasion and migration 28.

A frequently mutated novel gene, the nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1
(NSD1), was identified in 33 HNSCCs. Alterations included inactivating mutations (n=29)
and focal homozygous deletions (n=4). NSD1 is a Histone H3K36 methyltransferase, similar
to SETD2, which is frequently mutated in the clear cell variant of renal cell carcinoma, and
associated with DNA hypomethylation 29. Germline carriers of inactivating mutations in
NSD1 are associated with craniofacial abnormalities (Sotos syndrome), and malignancies
including squamous carcinoma, implicating NSD1 as a tumor suppressor gene 30.
Interestingly, NSD1 functions as an oncogene when fused to nucleoporin-98 (NUP98)
t(5;11)(q35;p15.5) in hematologic cancers with elevated H3K36me3 levels at HOXA genes
and accompanying transcriptional activation 31. Translocations involving other dedicated
H3K36 methyltransferase genes including WHSC1 / MMSET / NSD2 are reported in 20% of
multiple myelomas. In contrast NSD1 loss has been associated with sporadic non-melanoma
skin cancers 32. Significant inactivating mutations were found in genes linked to squamous
differentiation including in NOTCH1 (19%), and other non-significant (NS) family members
(NOTCH2 9%, and NOTCH3 5%, q>0.1, NS), and the TP63 target gene ZNF750 (4%,
q>0.1, NS) which falls in a significantly deleted peak at 17q25.3. The analysis identified
additional mutations including TRAF3, RB1, NFE2L2, among others with q-values <1(NS).
The frequently mutated apoptosis gene CASP8 displayed clustered missense and other
inactivating mutations in the first death effector, intron, and caspase peptidase domains.
Statistically significant mutations in KMT2D (aka MLL2) and HLAA could contribute to
defective immunosurveillance. Of known oncogenes, only PIK3CA achieved (q <0.01)
statistical significance. Approximately one-fourth of the mutated PIK3CA cases displayed
concurrent amplification, with an additional 20% of tumors containing focal amplification
without evidence of mutation. Seventy-three percent of PIK3CA mutations localized to
E542K, E545K, and H1047R/L hotspots that promote activation, with the remaining
mutations of uncertain function. Recurrent activating mutations of HRAS in the GTPase
domain in residues 11-13 approached statistical significance (q=0.2).
We extended our unsupervised genome-wide analysis of significantly mutated genes as well
as genes reported in COSMIC to a subgroup analysis by anatomic sites, tumor vs. normal
status, HPV status, and four previously validated gene expression subtypes (Section S5,
Figures S5.1-4, Data File S4.1, 5.1-4) 33,34 Additional mutations included TRAF3, RB1,
NFE2L2, among others with q-values <1, and we observed statistical evidence for mutations

of HRAS (q=0 in COSMIC subset) and other genes. Sporadic inactivating mutations and
deletions of TGFBR2 were identified primarily in oral cavity tumors, consistent with its role
in promoting squamous tumorigenesis in mouse models 35. Investigating COSMIC database
mutations focused attention on the significant deletion peak at 4q31.3 containing the gene
FBXW7, a ubiquitin ligase targeting cyclin E and NOTCH genes, in which we identified
mutations that included recurrent R505G/L substitutions (n=14). Genes with at least one
identical mutation previously reported in COSMIC include SCN9A, CHEK2, PTCH1, and
PIK3R1. We further focused on somatic alterations and protein expression that represent
plausible therapeutic targets (Figure 3) (Section S6, Figures S6.1,2, Data File S6.1,2, Section
S7).
Integrated Genome Analysis and Pathways

Author Manuscript

Correlative genetic alteration analysis identified numerous pairwise significant findings
(Section S7, Figure S7.1). In particular, co-amplification of 11q13 harboring CCND1,
FADD, and CTTN and a narrow segment of 11q22 harboring the genes with equal evidence
for YAP1 and BIRC2 was further characterized (Figure S7.2). Chromosome 11q22 was
focally but rarely amplified in the absence of co-amplification of 11q13. This novel finding
suggests that the selection pressure for this co-amplification stems from BIRC2's interaction
with FADD and the caspase cascade that inhibits cell death. Interestingly, the vast majority
of tumors with the 11q13 amplification had large deletions in the telomeric region of 11q22
including other genes known to be important in cell death in cancer including ATM and the
caspases 1, 4, 5, and 12. 11q13 amplification was anti-correlated with CASP8 mutations,
suggesting an alternate function of CASP8 and FADD in cell death/NF-κB activation 36.

We investigated whether clinical factors, single gene alterations and statistically significant
pairwise gene correlations (Figure S7.1, Data File S7.1) might segregate previously defined
molecular subtypes and/or anatomic sub-sites (Data File S5.1-4). We confirmed reported
gene expression subtypes (Atypical (24%), Mesenchymal (27%), Basal (31%), and Classical
(18%)), and assessed the subtypes for enrichment of somatic alterations (Data File
S7.1) 33,34. Notably, TP53 mutation, CDKN2A loss of function, chromosome 3q
amplification, alteration of oxidative stress genes (KEAP1, NFE2L2, or CUL3), heavy
smoking history (Table S1.1), and larynx sub-site co-occurred in the majority of Classical
subtype tumors (Figure 4A, Section S7.2), similar to LUSC (Figure S5.1, 2)5. Collectively,
these findings suggest that the NFE2L2 oxidative stress pathway is a tobacco-related
signature across anatomic tumor sites. In contrast, the Basal subtype demonstrated
inactivation of NOTCH1 with intact oxidative stress signaling and fewer alterations of
chromosome 3q. Analysis of the 3q locus highlighted a dramatic relative decrease of SOX2
expression in Basal tumors relative to all other HNSCC and tumor adjacent normal samples
(Figure S5.4) supporting the interaction of transcription factors SOX2, TP63, NFE2L2, and
NOTCH1 as driving differences between expression subtypes. Additionally, the Basal
subtype included most tumors with the HRAS-CASP8 co-mutation and the majority of coamplified 11q13/q22 tumors. These findings along with HRAS mutations implicate disrupted
cell death as a major alteration in this subtype (Figure S7.2) 37. The Atypical subtype was
characterized by a lack of chromosome 7 amplifications (Figure S5.3), enrichment of
HPV(+) tumors with activating mutations in exon 9 of the PIK3CA helicase domain. In

contrast, the Mesenchymal subtype showed high levels of alteration in innate immunity
genes, in particular high NK cell marker CD56 expression and a low frequency of HLA
class I mutations (Figure S7.3). Among the significantly mutated genes, TP53 (p<0.001),
CASP8 (p=0.01), NSD1 (p=0.01), and CDKN2A (0.06) were the most differentially mutated
across anatomic sites (Data File S4.1). The majority of CASP8 mutations (22/24, 92%) were
in oral cavity tumors, while TP53, NSD1, and CDKN2A demonstrated decreased mutation
rates in oropharyngeal tumors relative to other sites.

Unsupervised analysis of gene expression by HPV status and of reverse phase protein arrays
(RPPA, Section S6), DNA methylation (Section S8), and miRNA platforms (Section S9,
Table S9.1, Figure S7.4-9, Data File S7.1) showed high correlation across platforms
(p<0.01, Figure 4, S7.9, Data File S7.2) and coordinated alterations of genes including the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature (Figures S7.4, S7.7,8) 38. However,
within the broader cross-platform agreement, individual unsupervised clustering of miRNA,
RPPA, and DNA methylation data provided insight into the association of molecular
subtypes with single gene alterations. The most striking example was the detection of a
hypomethylation and loss of function mutations of NSD1, and wild type NOTCH1 in
Atypical and Classical gene expression subtypes (Figure 4B, Table S7.1).

Author Manuscript

Supervised analyses detected genomic features (miRNA, gene expression, and DNA
methylation) associated with anatomic site (Figure S5.5-8, Data File S5.1-4). A supervised
integrated analysis identified target genes that are inversely regulated by miRNAs in
HNSCC (Section S7.4). Among these miRNA-mRNA networks, let-7c-5p and miR-100-5p
exhibited a correlation between low copy number and expression. Let-7c-5p and
miR-100-5p were decreased in tumors compared to normal (Figure S7.10). For these
miRNAs, deletion was highly associated with increased expression of target genes,
including the cell cycle regulator CDK6, transcription factor E2F1 39 mitosis regulator
PLK1 40, and transcription factor HMGA2 (Figures S7.10, Tables S7.2, 3) 41.

Author Manuscript

Integrative bioinformatics analysis identified a limited number of pathways targeted by
frequent genome alterations (Figure 5; Section S7, Figure S7.11-15, Data File S7.3). Among
receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR/ERBB2 or FGFR1/3 alterations are the most frequent.
Among downstream targets of the RTK/RAS/PI3K pathway, PIK3CA dominates with
occasional HRAS and PTEN alterations. Further downstream, nearly every tumor has
alteration of genes governing the cell cycle. The tumor suppressors TP53, CDKN2A,
oncogenes CCND1, MYC, and the newly identified miR let-7c, are most often altered in
HPV(−) tumors, while viral E6/7 and E2F1 predominate in HPV(+) cases. In addition, we
report frequent alterations in genes involved in cell death, NF-κB-mediated survival, or
immunity pathways 15,36. Co-amplification of FADD+/−BIRC2, or CASP8+/−HRAS
mutations define exclusive HPV(−) subsets, while TRAF3 loss characterizes an HPV(+)
subset. These alterations along with PIK3CA and TP63 converge upon NF-κB transcription
factors that promote cell survival, migration, inflammation and angiogenesis 42,43.
Additionally, TRAF3 and/or HLA loss are implicated in deregulation of innate antiviral and
adaptive anti-tumor immunity 44,45. Further alterations of NOTCH, TP63, and other genes in
HPV(−) tumors (FAT1, AJUBA) recently linked functionally to beta-catenin (CTNNB1) are
also detected 21,22,46. Finally, we highlight a previously underappreciated role for a key

Conclusion

Author Manuscript

The TCGA study represents the most comprehensive integrative genomic analysis of
HNSCC. Loss of TRAF3, activating mutations of PIK3CA, and amplification of E2F1 in
HPV(+) oropharyngeal cancers point to aberrant activation of NF-κB, other oncogenic
pathways, and cell cycle, as critical in the pathogenesis and development of new targeted
therapies for these tumors. In HPV(−) HNSCC mutually exclusive subsets harboring
amplicons on 11q with CCND1, FADD, BIRC2 and YAP1, or concurrent mutations of
CASP8 with HRAS, also target cell cycle, death, NF-κB and other oncogenic pathways.
Recent studies predict that the inactivation of AJUBA, as well as FAT1 and NOTCH1 may
converge to uncheck Wnt/β−catenin signaling, implicated in deregulation of cell polarity and
differentiation. The 3q amplicon found in both HPV(+) and (-) HNSCC includes
transcription factors TP63, SOX2 and signal molecule PIK3CA, which are also implicated in
homeostasis of epithelial stem cells and differentiation. Among these, the biologic function
and agents targeting BIRCs, PI3K, Wnt/β−catenin and NOTCH are under investigation.
Collectively, these findings provide new insights into HNSCC and suggest that shared and
unique alterations might be leveraged to accelerate progress in prevention and therapy
across tumor types.
