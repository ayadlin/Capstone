ABSTRACT
Low grade serous ovarian tumours are a rare and under-characterised histological
subtype of epithelial ovarian tumours, with little known of the molecular drivers
and facilitators of tumorigenesis beyond classic oncogenic RAS/RAF mutations.
With a move towards targeted therapies due to the chemoresistant nature of this
subtype, it is pertinent to more fully characterise the genetic events driving this
tumour type, some of which may influence response to therapy and/or development
of drug resistance. We performed genome-wide high-resolution genomic copy number
analysis (Affymetrix SNP6.0) and mutation hotspot screening (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS,
HRAS, ERBB2 and TP53) to compare a large cohort of ovarian serous borderline
tumours (SBTs, n = 57) with low grade serous carcinomas (LGSCs, n = 19). Whole
exome sequencing was performed for 13 SBTs, nine LGSCs and one mixed low/
high grade carcinoma. Copy number aberrations were detected in 61% (35/57) of
SBTs, compared to 100% (19/19) of LGSCs. Oncogenic RAS/RAF/ERBB2 mutations
were detected in 82.5% (47/57) of SBTs compared to 63% (12/19) of LGSCs, with
NRAS mutations detected only in LGSC. Some copy number aberrations appeared
to be enriched in LGSC, most significantly loss of 9p and homozygous deletions

of the CDKN2A/2B locus. Exome sequencing identified BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, USP9X
and EIF1AX as the most frequently mutated genes. We have identified markers of
progression from borderline to LGSC and novel drivers of LGSC. USP9X and EIF1AX
have both been linked to regulation of mTOR, suggesting that mTOR inhibitors may
be a key companion treatment for targeted therapy trials of MEK and RAF inhibitors.

targeted therapies, in particular MEK and RAF inhibitor
trials for LGSC, there is an imperative to understanding
the molecular events underlying LGSC development as
well as those that may influence treatment outcome and
resistance mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION
Low grade serous ovarian carcinomas (LGSCs) are
an under-characterised histological subtype of epithelial
ovarian tumours. Although LGSC follow a relatively
indolent clinical course, they occur at a younger age than
high grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) and patients with
higher stage disease typically have poor overall survival
due to the inherent chemo-resistant nature of LGSCs [1].
With a < 5% response rate to chemotherapy [2], the
clinical behaviour of these tumours is in stark contrast to
the 80% response rate to primary chemotherapy observed
for women with HGSC.
Serous borderline tumours (SBTs) are considered
to be non-invasive precursor lesions to LGSC and a
significant proportion, particularly late stage, will recur
and progress to carcinoma given sufficient clinical
follow-up [3]. Some histological features have been
associated with a greater likelihood of progression and
recurrence, such as invasive implants and micropapillary
growth pattern [4]. It is currently unknown whether these
histological patterns are associated with specific molecular
events; if so, molecular profiling of borderline tumours
could offer significant improvements to predicting the
likelihood of progression and recurrence.
Little is known of the molecular drivers and
facilitators of tumourigenesis in SBT or LGSC beyond
the classic oncogenic KRAS and BRAF mutations,
and more recently ERBB2 and NRAS mutations [5, 6].
Approximately 40–60% of LGSC are RAS/RAF mutation
positive [6, 7], leaving a significant proportion with
unidentified drivers. In addition, RAS/RAF mutations
alone cannot explain the progression of SBT to carcinoma
as 70–80% of SBTs already carry oncogenic KRAS,
BRAF and ERBB2 mutations [5]. Thus, the molecular
events underlying the transition to carcinoma remain
undetermined.
To identify novel molecular drivers and molecular
features that might be predictive of clinical behaviour we
performed genome-wide high-resolution copy number
analysis on a large cohort of SBTs and LGSCs, as well
as exome sequencing of a subset of cases. We identified
recurrent oncogenic mutations and copy number
aberrations (CNAs) in the SBTs that were significantly
associated with clinical features, and CNAs and mutations
significantly associated with carcinomas that therefore
potentially underlie tumour progression. Through
exome sequencing we also identified somatic mutations
in a number of genes that have not been previously
associated with LGSC. With the current trend towards

RESULTS
RAS/RAF pathway mutations in SBT and LGSC
Mutation screening was performed on 57 SBT
and 19 LGSC (Table 1) by Sanger sequencing at
known mutational hotspots in the genes KRAS, BRAF,
NRAS, HRAS, ERBB2, and exons 5–8 of TP53 (Table
2, Supplementary Tables S1, S2). Overall, RAS/RAF
pathway mutations were identified in 82.5% of SBT
cases and 63% of LGSCs, similar to previous reports [5].
Of note, two SBTs were KRAS-BRAF double mutants
(Supplementary Table S1), with classic KRASG12 mutations
(p.G12D and p.G12V) and concurrent kinase activating
BRAF mutations (p.G464V and p.G469A) that occur
in the highly conserved P-loop. Frequent overlap of
BRAF P-loop mutations with KRAS mutations has been
previously reported in colorectal carcinomas [8].
Interestingly, activating p.Q61 NRAS mutations
were identified in 26% of the LGSCs but were absent
among 57 SBTs (p = 0.0006, Emmanuel et al. [6] and this
study) (Table 2). The mutation rate of other oncogenes was
not significantly different between the LGSCs and SBTs;
however there was a trend towards a lower frequency of
BRAF and KRAS mutants in the LGSCs and a higher rate
of “wildtype” tumours, where no oncogenic mutation was
identified (Table 2). No TP53 mutations were identified in
any SBT or LGSC cases.

Copy number aberrations are associated
with progression of SBT to LGSC but are less
frequent compared to HGSC
Genomic copy number aberrations (CNAs and
copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH)) were
identified in the epithelial component of 61.4% of
SBTs (Supplementary Table S1), and 100% of LGSCs
(Supplementary Table S2), similar to the frequencies
in previous reports [9, 10]. The most frequent CNAs
observed across SBTs and LGSCs involved loss of 1p
(20%), 9p (14%) and 19 (11%), and gain of 7/7q (18%),
8/8q (20%) and 12/12p (17%).
Significant enrichment of specific CNAs was
observed in the LGSCs compared to the SBTs (Figure 1A,
37664

event involved loss/LOH (loss of heterozygosity) of 9p
(2% of SBTs (1/57) versus 53% of LGSCs (10/19), p
< 0.0001, Supplementary Table S3). Sequencing of the
CDKN2A locus did not identify any mutations in the
LGSCs, however the single SBT with 9p LOH (IC508)
was found to have a 19 bp deletion that is predicted
to result in truncation of both p16INK4A and p19ARF
(Supplementary Table S1). Three of the LGSCs with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

LOH also harboured homozygous deletions targeting the
CDKN2A/2B locus at 9p21.3. We further evaluated p16
through immunohistochemical staining (Supplementary
Figures S1, S2). There was a trend towards weaker staining
in the LGSCs (n = 25) compared to the SBTs (n = 30)
(p = 0.12, Fisher’s Exact Test, FET), while HGSCs (n =
192) had a higher proportion of strongly staining cases (p
< 0.0001, FET) (Supplementary Table S4). A trend towards

Table S6) did not harbour any detectable somatic
CNAs or CNLOH. There was a trend for these
cases to have either a BRAF mutation (13/24, 58%,
p = 0.1744, FET) or an ERBB2 mutation (3/3, p =
0.0526, FET; Supplementary Table S6), but this did
not reach statistical significance. Considering mutual
exclusivity between chromosomal instability and
microsatellite instability (MSI) [14], reports of overlap
between BRAFV600E mutations with MSI in colorectal
tumours [15] and reports of MSI in SBTs [16], 14
tumours with BRAFV600E mutations were tested for MSI.
All 14 tumours tested were found to be microsatellite
stable (Supplementary Table S1). However, all three
BRAF mutant LGSCs identified in this cohort had
CNAs (Supplementary Table S2), perhaps suggesting a
requirement for copy number events for progression in a
BRAF-mutant context. In contrast to BRAF and ERBB2
mutations, activating KRAS mutations were significantly
associated with the presence of genomic aberrations in
SBT (p = 0.0199, FET; Supplementary Table S6) and a
larger FGA (Supplementary Figure S5, p = 0.04, twotailed t-test).
We then determined whether clinical features
were associated with oncogenic mutations. For SBTs,
bilaterality was found to be significantly more common for
KRAS mutant tumours (63.2% versus 26.5%, p = 0.0101,
FET; Supplementary Table S6), whereas the majority
of BRAFV600E mutant tumours (76.2%) were unilateral.
The presence of a KRAS mutation was also significantly
associated with a tumour stage > I (p = 0.0240, FET;
Supplementary Table S6). No statistically significant
associations were identified between micropapillary
changes or microinvasion and a single oncogenic mutation
or specific CNA. Intriguingly however, both BRAF-KRAS
double-mutant tumours had reported micropapillary
architecture (compared to 5/55 cases of remaining cohort,
p = 0.01, FET).
Associating clinical features with oncogenic
mutations or CNAs in the LGSC cohort was difficult due
to the majority of these tumours being bilateral and late
stage (Table 1). The presence of reported micropapillary
growth pattern was not enriched in LGSCs (3/19)
compared to SBTs (7/57) (p = 0.7040, FET), however,
based on pathology review of microdissected areas 4/19
LGSCs displayed a dominant micropapillary growth
pattern compared to 0/57 SBTs (p = 0.003, FET).
Micropapillary architecture appeared to be associated with
the presence of a NRASQ61 mutation in these LGSCs (3/4
of cases), however the numbers are small.

LGSC (p = 0.07, FET) was also observed (Supplementary
Table S5, Supplementary Figures S1 and S2).
Loss of chromosome 22 or gain of chromosome
13, was not observed in any of the SBT cohort, but these
aberrations were observed in 32% and 16% of the LGSCs,
respectively (Figure 1A, Supplementary Table S3). Losses
of 1p, 9q, 18q and X were aberrations observed in the
SBTs that was significantly enriched in the LGSCs (Figure
1, Supplementary Table S3). The most frequent copy
number gains observed in the SBT cohort (chromosomes
7, 8 and 12) were not significantly enriched in the LGSC
cases.
The LGSCs in this cohort were found to have,
on average, a greater fraction of their genomes altered
(FGA) compared to the SBT cohort (p = 0.0001, MannWhitney test; Figure 1B), however, a subset of the SBT
cohort had equivalent FGA to the LGSCs. LGSCs also
had more intrachromosomal breakpoints (p = 0.03,
Mann-Whitney-test; Figure 1C). The SBTs and LGSCs
were compared to a mixed cohort of grade 2–3 serous
carcinomas, including seven unique to this study, 33
previously published [11] and 316 from TCGA [12].
Comparison of rates of intrachromosomal breakpoints
and FGA revealed a broad range of genomic aberration in
all HGSC cohorts compared to the generally low rates in
SBTs and LGSCs (Figure 1B–1C). Considering FGA and
number of intrachromosomal breakpoints in combination,
as expected the SBT and LGSC cohorts clustered together
with low genomic aberration levels (Supplementary
Figure S3). HGSCs displayed a wide range of breakpoint
rates and FGA, but tended not to cluster with the SBTs
and LGSCs.
Seven reported HGSCs appeared to have a lowgrade pattern of genomic aberrations and clustered with
the SBT/LGSC (<18 breakpoints, Supplementary Figure
S3). These cases were enriched for RAS/RAF mutations
(4/7 had a RAS/RAF mutation compared to 4/348, p <
0.0001, FET) and had no detectable TP53 mutations.
These seven low grade-like tumours, part of the 2011
TCGA publication [12] were the centre of a recent
study [13] suggesting they have wildtype TP53 and
least four are likely to be SBT (n = 1) and LGSC (n =
3). The remainder were reported by Wong et al. [13] as
malignant mixed Müllerian tumour (n = 1) and HGSC
(n = 2). In contrast, four HGSC cases with RAS/RAF
mutations and > 18 breakpoints all had a TP53 mutation
(Figure 1C, Supplementary Figures S3 and S4).

sequencing in a validation cohort of SBT (n = 44, EIF1AX,
n = 23 USP9X) and 10 LGSC (EIF1AX, SF3B1, USP9X,
NCK1, RNASE1). No additional mutations in 10 LGSC
were identified in RNASE1, NCK1 or SF3B1, bringing
the aggregate frequency (including published exomes) of
mutations in these genes to 7% (2/27), 7% (2/27) and 4%
(1/27). Sanger sequencing of exons 1 and 2, including exonintron boundaries, of EIF1AX in a validation cohort of 44
SBT and 10 LGSC identified an additional three somatic
EIF1AX mutations in three LGSCs (Table 3), bringing
the overall frequency to 4/27 (15%) LGSCs and 1/60
(1.7%) SBTs. Additionally, a rare EIF1AX 5′ UTR SNP
(rs201653081) was identified in a single SBT (IC20T). All
44 coding exons of USP9X were screened in an additional
10 LGSC and 23 SBT and identified a nonsense mutation
in one LGSC. The aggregate frequency of mutations in
USP9X was 11% (3/27) LGSCs and 2.6% (1/39) SBTs
(Table 3). All splicing variants in EIF1AX and USP9X were
predicted to disrupt the coding sequence by Human Splicing
Finder (HSF v2.4.1).

pathway. Additionally, it is likely that ancillary events
alongside RAS/RAF mutations are required to initiate and
drive neoplasia and these are essentially unknown. In order
to address these knowledge gaps we undertook exome
sequencing of 13 SBTs (including three RAS/RAF mutation
wildtype), nine LGSCs (including three RAS/RAF mutation
wildtype) and one tumour with primarily low grade
histology but foci of grade 2/3 differentiation.
We identified a total of 396 somatic variants in the
23 tumours using stringent filtering, and an additional 19
somatic variants identified by Pindel only. We undertook
Sanger validation of 106/396 stringent variants, achieving
a validation rate of 91%, and 10/19 Pindel-only variants,
achieving a validation rate of 50% (Supplementary Table
S7). Mutation rates in SBT and LGSC cohorts were found
to be relatively low, but quite similar with ranges of 6–24
(median 15) and 9–27 (median 18) mutations, respectively
(Figure 2A). These rates are similar to those previously
reported in two small studies of SBT and LGSC [17, 18],
and 4–5 times lower than the average 1.8 mutations/Mb
reported for HGSC [12]. The carcinoma with mixed low
and high grade histology had the highest mutation rate
with 35 SNVs and small indels detected. Although the
low mutation rate limits the power of mutation signature
analyses, there was a clear trend towards C > T/G > A
transitions across the tumour cohort (Figure 2B), with an
enrichment in the context of NpCpG, with the exception
of TpCpG (Figure 2C).
Three of six “wildtype” tumours had identifiable
alternative RAS/MAPK or ERBB2 pathway mutations
– novel ARAF (p.(G11E)) and NCK1 (p.(E336del))
mutations in combination, PAK1 (p.(S57_I58insFFR))
and NF1 (p.(E1119X)) mutations in combination, and
an ERBB2 essential acceptor splice site mutation that
results in skipping of exon 16 (Supplementary Figure
S6A), which encodes part of the growth factor receptor IV
domain, in combination with a truncating TSC1 mutation
(p.(P141fs11X)). We also identified 17 novel recurrently
mutated genes (Figure 3). To increase the power of our
analysis to detect significant genes outside of the RAS/
RAF pathway, we analysed our data together with
validated variants from the published studies of Jones
et al. (n = 5 pure LGSC), Boyd et al. (n = 2 SBT) and
TCGA cases reported by Wong et al. [13] as SBT (n = 1)
or LGSC (n = 3); the results from the 34 tumours are
summarised in Figure 3. A number of the recurrently
mutated genes have been previously associated with
tumourigenesis (EIF1AX, USP9X, NCK1, RNASE1),
while other genes (DNAH3, DNAH10, DNA11) have no
clear role in tumourigenesis and are potentially recurrently
mutated by chance because of their large size. However,
DNAH3 mutations have been previously reported as
cooperative with mutant APC in colon epithelial cell
transformation [19] and cannot be completely discounted.
Mutation screening was performed for the genes
EIF1AX, SF3B1, USP9X, NCK1 and RNASE1 using Sanger

Pathway analyses
Pathway analyses identified MAPK/ERBB2
signalling pathways and regulators (Figure 4), and RAS/
RAF/ERBB2-dependent cancer-associated pathways as
significantly enriched. When these genes were removed
from the analysis, a variety of regulation of gene
expression mechanisms were found to be significantly
enriched based on mutations in the methyltransferases
and demethylases DOT1L, KMT2A, KDM5C, KDM5A,
and the SMRT complex component NCOR2 and the SWI/
SNF components SMARCA4. Other genes not identified
in this pathway analysis but with established roles in
transcription regulation, RNA pol II regulation or mRNA
regulation included HCFC1, MED12L, ANKRD11,
SMYD3 and DHX34.

DISCUSSION
BRAF, KRAS, NRAS and ERBB2 oncogenic
mutations are not biologically equivalent
In this study, the total number of samples with
a mutation in KRAS, BRAF, HRAS or ERBB2 was
significantly lower in LGSCs (7/19) than SBTs (47/57,
p < 0.001, FET). In contrast, NRAS mutations were not
observed in the SBT cohort, possibly indicating a much
greater oncogenic potential. NRAS mutations were
detected in 26% of LGSCs, in keeping with previous
reports [6]. Our findings support earlier observations
that BRAF mutations are less frequent in LGSC and are
associated with earlier stage, better outcomes and a lower
likelihood of recurrence in SBTs and LGSCs [7, 20, 21].
ERBB2 mutations have not been reported in LGSC, which
may indicate a lower oncogenic potential, but may simply
reflect under-investigation.

Bilaterality in SBTs has been reported in
approximately one-third of cases [22] and molecular
evidence supports a common clonal origin for the
cells of the majority of these bilateral tumours [9, 23].
Bilaterality is likely to be a direct result of tumour
spread, corresponding with stage, therefore bilateral
SBT or LGSC lesions should rarely be considered as
independent lesions. The RAS/RAF mutation status
of SBTs was found to correlate with tumour stage
and specific genomic aberrations, suggestive of
molecular subtypes within this group. The significant
and differential association of KRAS mutations with
bilaterality/tumour spread and BRAF/ERBB2 mutations
with genomic stability suggests that despite all of these
gene products being associated with the RAS/MEK/
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ERK pathway, mutant forms of these genes are not
biologically equivalent in this context. The tendency of
KRAS mutants to have genomic CNAs and the BRAF
mutants to have none or very few may be explained
in part by their respective relationships with RAF-1
(CRAF), since increased activity of RAF-1 is associated
with aneuploidy induction. Oncogenic KRAS and NRAS
have each been demonstrated to induce RAF isoform
switching to activate RAF-1, but not BRAF [24].
In addition to our LGSC cohort, we also report
here are a small number of serous carcinoma cases
with coinciding RAS and TP53 mutations, all of which
were high grade-like in their genomic characteristics
(Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). It is unclear whether
these high grade-like tumours followed the typical

Progression of SBT to LGSC may be associated
with distinct molecular events

or highly enriched in, the LGSCs, indicating a molecularly
identifiable transition from borderline tumour to carcinoma
and possible predictors for likelihood of progression.
However, our samples were not matched SBT-LGSC
pairs, thus at present our findings are correlative. For
some of these alterations, such as loss of 1p or 22, the
underlying driver gene is not known. Exome sequencing
did not identify any homozygously mutated genes in
these regions, so genes affected by haploinsufficiency or

The global level of CNA was higher in LGSCs
than SBTs, however a subset of the SBTs in this study

Figure 4: Molecular drivers of low grade serous ovarian tumours. Proteins circled in red indicate mutated genes identified in
this study. Along with the central components of the ERBB2/RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway, a number of tumours also carried concurrent
mutations in regulators of the pathway.

promoter methylation may be the targets. In contrast, 9p
LOH has a clear candidate gene in CDKN2A, particularly
given the highly focused homozygous deletions observed.
Only one of the 57 SBTs was observed to have
an LOH event targeting CDKN2A compared to 53% of
LGSCs. The increased rate of loss of 9p/9p21.3 in LGSCs
compared to SBTs suggests that loss of p16/ARF/p15
activity may be integral to progression from borderline
tumour to carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry for p16 does
not entirely reflect the relationship observed at the copy
number level for LGSC. Although a trend was observed
for decreasing p16 staining from SBT to LGSC, generally
the patterns observed in low grade tumours are highly
heterogeneous (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). This
staining heterogeneity may reflect some level of tumour

(epi) genetic heterogeneity or potentially indicates that it
is the combinatorial loss of p16/ARF/p15 that is important.
Our results are consistent with previous reports of p16
staining as a differential between LGSC and HGSC [25,
26]. It is clear from these results, however, that p16
IHC cannot be used to differentiate SBTs from LGSCs,
consistent with the findings of Altman et al. (2013).

Novel molecular drivers
Although LGSCs have long been known to be
characterised by KRAS and BRAF mutations, 20–30%
of SBTs and 55–75% of LGSCs are wildtype for these
archetypical mutations. In this and a previous study we
identified NRAS mutations in an additional ~20% of

be disease causing raising the possibility that germline
mutations in EIF1AX and other candidate genes could
potentially genetically predispose to this tumour type,
which may explain the typically younger age of diagnosis
compared to other subtypes of ovarian cancer.
USP9X (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9X) mutations
were identified in 2.6% SBTs and 11% LGSCs, and a focal
deletion in a mixed-grade carcinoma. USP9X has been
found to regulate the stability of a diversity of proteins,
and potentially as a result of this appears quite contextdependent in its function, sometimes with oncogenic
characteristics and sometimes tumour suppressive.
In prostate cancer cells USP9X has been found to
deubiquitinate and stabilise ERG [32], while increasing
expression of USP9X was found to correlate with higher
grade and poorer outcome in oesophageal squamous cell
carcinomas [33]. In contrast, USP9X was found to be
targeted by recurrent truncating mutations and deletion
in gingivo-buccal oral squamous cell carcinoma [34]
characteristic of a tumour suppressor gene, and reduced
expression has been associated with poorer survival
and increased metastatic burden in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma patients [35]. USP9X mutations have
been identified in several cancer types at significant levels
in the TCGA studies: 11% of endometrial carcinoma, 9%
of stomach adenocarcinoma and 9% of head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (cBioportal) [28]. USP9X
has been isolated as a component of both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 complexes, and potentially functions as a
negative regulator of mTOR [36] (Figure 4), with links to
anoikis resistance and chemotherapy response in multiple
cancer types [35, 37, 38] warranting further investigation
to assess the likely impact on new treatments being trialled
in LGSC.

LGSCs but still leaving a sizable proportion of cases with
no known mutation. It remains to be determined whether
other RAS/MAPK pathway members are mutated in these
“wildtype” tumours. Three tumours contained mutations in
ERBB2/RAS/RAF/MEK pathway members or regulators:
an ARAF mutation in combination with a NCK1 mutation,
a PAK1 mutation in combination with a NF1 mutation, and
an ERBB2 mutation in combination with a TSC1 mutation.
However, some of these and other potential alternative
driver genes identified in wildtype tumours such as
KMT2A, FANCC and ERC1 were also identified in many
of the RAS/RAF mutant cases (Figure 3). The drivers
of these wildtype tumours therefore remain unclear. It
is possible that mutations in genes outside of the exome
targeted here are responsible, or that larger-scale CNA,
inversions or translocations may be important, especially
given the trend towards wildtype tumours harbouring more
extensive CNAs. These possibilities would be best tested
by whole-genome sequencing of a larger cohort, however,
we did note that KRAS/BRAF/HRAS/ERBB2/NRASwildtype tumours were enriched for loss of heterozygosity
on 17q in both the SBT and LGSC cohorts (combined
p = 0.005 FET), which is potentially associated with an
alternative driver such as NF1 although only a single
truncating NF1 mutation was detected in this study.
Exome sequencing identified two novel candidate
genes, EIF1AX and USP9X, which are enriched in
LGSC compared to SBT, suggesting they may be key
contributors to carcinogenesis, although the biological
impacts of mutant EIF1AX and USP9X in ovarian tumours
remains to be determined. Mutations in these genes were
almost exclusively identified in BRAF/KRAS/NRAS mutant
tumours, suggestive of cooperative biological effects.
EIF1AX has recently been reported as recurrently
mutated in uveal melanomas, in mutual exclusion with
mutations in SF3B1 [27]. Through exome and targeted
sequencing we identified somatic EIF1AX mutations in
1.7% of SBTs and 15% of LGSCs, and one mixed grade
carcinoma. These mutations were mutually exclusive
with a single SF3B1 p.K700E hotspot mutation identified
in a LGSC. EIF1AX mutations have been detected at
low frequency in a variety of cancer types reported in
the TCGA studies (1.6% endometrial carcinoma, 1.5%
thyroid carcinoma, 1.4% low grade glioma, 1.3% lung
adenocarcinoma, 1.1% cutaneous melanoma (cBioPortal)
[28]. EIF1AX forms a core component of the eukaryotic
translation initiation complex [29] and a potential
promoter of mTOR activity as part of a complex with
14-3-3γ and RPS7 [30] (Figure 4). The functional effects
of EIF1AX mutation are unknown, but are anticipated to
have a global impact on protein production. Interestingly,
a rare EIF1AX 5′ UTR germline SNP (rs201653081) was
identified in one SBT case, the same SNP being recently
identified in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, which show
some overlap in their mutation spectrum with LGSC.
The 5′ UTR SNP is predicted by MutationTaster [31] to

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue samples and DNA extraction
Clinical features of the cohort of 57 histologically
confirmed SBT and 19 LGSC (of which two cases were
recurrences of prior SBTs) are summarised in Table 1.
Fresh-frozen tissue samples were used for copy number
and mutation analyses. All samples were collected with
the patient's informed consent and the study was approved
by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the Peter
MacCallum Cancer Centre. Patients with ovarian tumours
were identified through four primary sources: a) hospitals
in the Wessex Region, UK (n = 7 SBT, n = 41 serous
carcinoma) [39], b) the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study
(AOCS) (n = 50 SBT) [5], c) Prince Henry’s Institute,
Victoria, Australia (n = 4 serous carcinoma) and the
OvCaRe Tissue Bank, Vancouver, Canada (n = 12 serous
carcinoma). The AOCS (http://www.aocstudy.org) was
approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees at

Each case was independently reviewed by two
pathologists (RS, PM, CBG, PA). Pathology review
was conducted on cryosections adjacent to the tissue
from which DNA was extracted and where possible
from multiple other diagnostic formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tumour blocks. Microdissection and DNA
extraction were performed as previously described
[40], briefly, epithelial and adjacent stromal tissue
were needle microdissected from H&E stained sections
(Supplementary Figure S7, Supplementary Tables S1
and S2).

For each case 500 ng − 1 μg of microdissected
tumour DNA and matched lymphocyte DNA (in one case
stromal DNA was used) was sheared to < 1000 bp using a
Covaris® ultra-sonicator (Covaris®), libraries prepared using
the Illumina TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation procedure
(Illumina), and enriched for exome sequencing using the
SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v2.0 (Roche NimbleGen).
Exomes were sequenced with 100 bp PE reads in pools of
three per lane on a HiSeq2000 (Illumina), to a 140x mean
coverage of target bases, with > 90% of target bases covered
at 10x for all samples (average 95.6 %), and an average of
90% of target bases with 1/5 of the mean coverage.
Sequence reads were aligned to the human genome
(GRCh37/hg19) using BWA-MEM (v0.7.7-r441) [43];
duplicates marked using Picard (v1.77); local indel
realignment and base quality recalibration performed using
GATK (v2.7-2-g6bda569) [44]; indel detection performed
using GATK Unified Genotyper (v2.7-2-g6bda569), Indel
Genotyper, Pindel (v0.2.5a3) [45], and VarScan2 (v2.2.4) [46];
SNV prediction performed using GATK Unified Genotyper,
MuTect (v2.7-1-g42d771f) [47], SomaticSniper [48],
JointSNVMix2 (v0.8-b2) [49], and VarScan2 (v2.2.4); and
variants annotated using Ensembl variant effect predictor v73.
Variants were enriched for somatic events by filtering
for > = 0.05 alternate allele frequency in the tumour and
< 0.05 alternate allele frequency in the germline. Variants
were additionally filtered for those with >= 3 reads
supporting the alternate allele and called by >= 3 variant
prediction algorithms, and filtered against a database of
250 in-house exomes to remove common variants and
artefacts. This more stringently filtered list of somatically
mutated genes was subsequently used to identify potentially
recurrently mutated genes where additional variants had not
reached the stringent thresholds.
Pathway and functional mutation enrichment analyses
were performed using IntOGen Mutation Analysis v2.4.1
[50] and MetaCore™ v6.0 Enrichment Analysis Workflow
for genomic variants (Thomas Reuters).

Copy number data and analysis
SBTs and LGSCs were analysed using Affymetrix
SNP6.0 Human Mapping arrays according to the protocol
recommended by the manufacturer, with the exception
that the input was reduced from 500 ng to 250 ng and the
reaction volumes were reduced by 50% for all processes
prior to the SNP6.0 PCR step. Reduction in DNA input
does not result in any loss in data quality [41]. All
previously unpublished SNP data has been made publicly
available through Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE58579,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Copy number analysis
was performed as previously described [40], using Nexus
Copy Number™ 7.0 Discovery Edition (BioDiscovery,
Inc.) and Partek® Genomics Suite 6.5.

Mutation screening
Mutation screening was performed by Sanger
sequencing using whole-genome amplified DNA as
previously described [40]. All samples were assessed
at BRAF exons 11 and 15, KRAS codons 12, 13 and 61,
HRAS codons 12, 13 and 61, ERBB2 exon 20, TP53
exons 4–9, and CDKN2A exons 1 and 2 (LGSCs only).
NRAS mutation data for the 47 AOCS SBTs was derived
from Emmanuel et al. [6], the remaining 10 SBTs and the
LGSCs were all sequenced for NRAS codons 12, 13 and
61. Sanger screening was also performed for the following
candidate genes: SF3B1 (NM_012433.2) exons 14, 15
and 16; EIF1AX (NM_001412.3) exons 1 and 2; USP9X
(NM_001039590.2) exons 2–45; RNASE1 (NM_002933.4)
exon 2; NCK1 (NM_006153.4) exons 2–4. Primers were
designed using Primer3 [42] and are listed in Supplementary
Table S8. All mutations were validated in non-wholegenome amplified DNA.

Statistical analyses
Associations between mutations and CNAs or
histological features were determined using Fisher’s Exact
Test (FET). For the purposes of this study tumour stage
was considered as stage I or > stage I (stage II–IV). MannWhitney tests were used to assess the difference in mean
fraction of the genome altered (FGA) and intrachromosomal
breakpoints between tumour groups using GraphPad Prism
version 6.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA).

Microsatellite instability
Microsatellite stability testing was performed using
the NCI-recommended reference panel of five microsatellite
markers (BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346, D17S250)
and an additional four microsatellite markers (see
Supplementary Table S8 for oligonucleotide details).

CONCLUSIONS
We have identified a correlation between the specific
oncogenic activation and tumour spread beyond the ovary
in SBT. We also identified a number of genomic CNAs
and mutations in novel genes that are enriched in or unique
to LGSCs compared to SBTs, indicating that there are key
identifiable molecular events underlying this transition,
including novel mutations in EIF1AX and USP9X. These
findings suggest the possibility of using patient-specific
molecular events to improve treatment practices to best suit
the clinical behaviour of the tumour, although larger studies
with clinical follow-up are required. Long term clinical
management is an important consideration as although patients
have a very good short-term prognosis, over an extended
period recurrence and progression of SBTs to LGSCs can be
significant and later stage LGSCs are often chemoresistant.
