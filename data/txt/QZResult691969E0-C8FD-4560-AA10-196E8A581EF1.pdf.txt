Abstract
Heat shock protein (hsp) 90 is an ATP-dependent molecular
chaperone that maintains the active conformation of
client oncoproteins in cancer cells. An isoform, hsp90A,
promotes extracellular maturation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, involved in tumor invasion and metastasis.
Knockdown of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 6, which deacetylates lysine residues in hsp90, induces reversible hyperacetylation and attenuates ATP binding and chaperone
function of hsp90. Here, using mass spectrometry, we
identified seven lysine residues in hsp90A that are hyperacetylated after treatment of eukaryotic cells with a panHDAC inhibitor that also inhibits HDAC6. Depending on the
specific lysine residue in the middle domain involved,
although acetylation affects ATP, cochaperone, and client
protein binding to hsp90A, acetylation of all seven lysines
increased the binding of hsp90A to 17-allyl-amino-demethoxy
geldanamycin. Notably, after treatment with the pan-HDAC
inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589), the extracellular hsp90A
was hyperacetylated and it bound to MMP-2, which was
associated with increased in vitro tumor cell invasiveness.
Treatment with antiacetylated hsp90A antibody inhibited
in vitro invasion by tumor cells. Thus, reversible hyperacetylation modulates the intracellular and extracellular
chaperone function of hsp90, and targeting extracellular
hyperacetylated hsp90A may undermine tumor invasion and
metastasis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4833–42]

Introduction
Heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) is a constitutively and ubiquitously expressed, ATP-dependent molecular chaperone (1). It
exerts an essential role in proper folding and in maintaining the
active conformation, intracellular disposition, and proteolytic
turnover of a large number of the progrowth and prosurvival
substrate client oncoproteins in cancer cells (1). Therefore, hsp90
has emerged as a promising target in cancer therapy (2). Activation
of client proteins by hsp90-based chaperone machine involves an
ordered association with several cochaperones, e.g., p23, cdc37, and
Aha-1, linked to the ATPase cycle of hsp90, which may also direct
client protein specificity (3–5). Hsp90 exists predominantly as a
homodimer, with transient association between NH2-terminal
domains, thus functioning as a dimeric ‘‘molecular clamp’’ (6).
Each hsp90 monomer is modular with three well-defined domains.

These include the NH2-terminal nucleotide-binding domain, a
middle domain (MD) that completes the ATPase site and binds to
client proteins, as well as the COOH-terminal dimerization domain
(7, 8). ATP binding and hydrolysis triggers conformational change in
the hsp90 homodimer, which is crucial for its binding to the
cochaperones, as well as for its interaction with various client
oncoproteins in the cancer cells (1, 9, 10). The hsp90 chaperone
cycle includes (a) an open, apo, nucleotide-free conformation in
which each of the three domains in each monomer presents
hydrophobic surface to the large interdomain cleft, a conformation
most optimal for client protein binding; (b) an ATP-bound
intermediate state; and (c) a closed ADP-bound state (8). There
are two isoforms of hsp90, i.e., hsp90a and hsp90h, which are
encoded by two separate genes (11, 12). Only hsp90a has been
described to be extracellular, where it serves as a molecular
chaperone and activates matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 (11, 12).
In addition to cochaperone association as well as ATP binding
and hydrolysis, posttranslational modifications such as hyperphosphorylation (13–15), S-nitrosylation, and reversible hyperacetylation have also been shown to regulate the chaperone
function of hsp90 (16–18). Several serine-threonine phosphorylation sites have been identified in hsp90. Although hyperphosphorylation negatively regulates hsp90 chaperone function, the role of
site-specific phosphorylation in modulating hsp90 function has yet
to be fully elucidated. Lysine (K) acetylation is a reversible
modification mediated by opposing actions of acetyltransferases
(HAT) and deacetylases (HDAC) in which an acetyl group is
covalently linked to lysine residues of target proteins (19). After
treatment with a variety of pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors
(HDI), including the hydroxamic acid analogues vorinostat,
LAQ824, and panobinostat (LBH589), or after siRNA-mediated
knockdown of HDAC6, reversible hyperacetylation of hsp90 has
been documented (17, 18). Overall, hyperacetylation of hsp90 was
shown to inhibit the ATP, cochaperone p23, and client protein
binding to hsp90, directing the client proteins to polyubiquitylation
and proteasomal degradation (18). In a recent report, Scroggins
and colleagues (20) identified the K294 in the MD of hsp90a as a
discrete acetylation site. They also determined that the acetylation
status of K294 is a strong determinant of client protein and
cochaperone binding to hsp90a. Although they noted that hsp90 is
acetylated at more than one site, identification of these sites or
their functional significance was not determined (20). In the
present study, we determined the identity and functional
significance of the domain-specific seven-lysine residues that are
hyperacetylated, after treatment with pan-HDAC inhibitors that
also inhibit HDAC6. Remarkably, hyperacetylated hsp90a was
extracellular and acted as a chaperone for MMP-2, which promoted
in vitro invasion by breast cancer cells. Our findings also show that
treatment with antiacetyl lysine-69 hsp90a antibody markedly
inhibits the invasiveness of breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods

Table 1. Sequence of mutagenesis primers

Cell lines, antibodies, and plasmids. HEK293T, MDA-MB-468, MDAMB-231, and T47D cells were all purchased from American Tissue Culture
Collection. HEK293T and MDA-MB-468 cells were maintained in DMEM;
T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). The following antibodies used were purchased from
commercial sources: anti-CHIP (Abcam); anti-hsp40 (SPA-450; StressGen);
anti-hsp90a (SPA-840; StressGen); anti-hsp90a (polyclonal; GeneTex); antip23 (Alexis Biochemicals), anti-acetyl-lysine (monoclonal), and anti-AKT
(Cell Signaling); anti-Acetyl lysine (polyclonal; Upstate-Millipore); antiHA.11 (monoclonal; Covance), anti-cRaf, and anti-MMP2 (Santa Cruz
Biotech.); and anti-FLAG (M2 monoclonal and F polyclonal), ANTI-FLAG
M2 agarose, anti–h-actin (Sigma), and agarose conjugates (Upstate).
Plasmids expressing FLAG (F)-hsp90 and HA-p300 have previously been
described (21, 22). Hsp90 mutants were generated by site-directed
mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene (23). All mutants
were verified by sequencing at the DNA Core Laboratory of Medical College
of Georgia. The sequence of mutagenesis primers is provided in Table 1.
Acetylated-K69 hsp90A antibody. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody
against Ac-K69-hsp90a was generated by Alpha Diagnostic based on the
synthetic 12 amino acid peptide flanking K69 (acetylated) ETLTDPSKLDSGK.
Affinity-purified antibody was checked by performing an ELISA, using free
peptide containing acetylated lysine. The antibody specifically recognized
acetylated peptide but not nonacetylated peptide dotted on nitrocellulose
membrane (data not shown). The antibody also recognized increase in
hsp90a acetylation after HDAC inhibitor treatment and untreated acetylated
hsp90a (see Fig. 6B).
Transfections, immunoprecipitations, and immunoblots. After
culture in the plates for 24 h, cells were transfected by Lipofectamine
Plus following the protocol provided by Invitrogen. Transfected cells were
cultured in full medium containing drugs dissolved in DMSO or vehicle
for 24 h. Cellular extracts were prepared by directly adding lysis buffer
[25 mmol/L Tris-phosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mmol/L DTT, 2 mmol/L
1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N‘,N ’,N‘,N ’-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and
0.2% Triton X-100] to the cells on ice. For immunoprecipitations (IP),
2  106 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected and/or treated as described
above. Cellular extracts were prepared and IP was performed as described
(24). For immunoblotting, cellular extracts or immunoprecipitates were
separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed
with antibodies, and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence, as
described (24).
Purification of acetylated hsp90A. Using anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads,
F-tagged hsp90a protein was affinity captured from F-hsp90a–transfected
HEK 293 cells that had been treated with 100 nmol/L LBH589 (Novartis
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). This was followed by IP of acetylated F-hsp90a using
acetyl lysine agarose beads. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved
by 8% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized using Coomassie Blue stain.
Mass spectrometric determination of hsp90A acetylation sites. For
comprehensive detection of the acetylation sites, mass spectrometry (MS)
in combination with MS/MS was used (25). First, gel slices from SDS-PAGE
separation of cell lysates were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion to create
peptides whose mass can be searched against public data bases. For peptide
detection, we used an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer with
Mascot (Matrix Science) protein search engine. The sample was loaded
using a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid into the instrument according to
manufacturer’s instructions and run in a data-dependent MS plus MS/MS
mode. This allows for the documentation of the peptides creating a protein
fingerprint for protein identification as well as documentation of the
peptides for further analysis through postsource fragmentation. Once the
peptides were detected, the instrument was told to go back to each sample
and fragment the individual top 20 peptides creating fragments of different
lengths that can be reassembled by the computer to predict, in combination
with the identification from the fingerprint data, the sequence of the
peptide. The sequence data, in turn, was used to bolster the protein
identification call. The program allows for certain user input modifications
that will allow for missed cleavages as a result of enzyme inefficiency as well

as blocked sites. The software also allows for input of potential
modifications that might add additional mass to a peptide, allowing the
search engine to call the peptide in either its modified or unmodified state
and with or without missed cleavages resulting from any modifications or
enzyme inefficiencies. All of this information was amassed, and the call for
identification and of the potential modification at a certain site was
statistically calculated, and the highest probability calls are reported.
ATP-sepharose binding assay. Hsp90a in 200 Ag of cell lysates was
affinity precipitated using KinaseBind g-phosphate–linked ATP resin
(Innova Biosciences) at 4jC for 4 h. After washing three or four times
with the lysis buffer, the resin was pelleted and SDS-PAGE analysis was
performed (18).
Biotinylated-geldanamycin binding assay. Biotinylated-geldanamycin
(B-GA) binding to hsp90 was assessed as described previously (26). Briefly,
cell lysates were incubated with or without 17-allyl-amino-demethoxy
geldanamycin (17-AAG; Developmental Therapeutics Branch of Cancer
Therapy Evaluation Program/National Cancer Institute/NIH) for 1 h at 4jC,
and then incubated with B-GA to displace 17-AAG from hsp90 for another
1 h. GM-bound hsp90 was captured by biotin-GA linked to streptavidin
Mutein Matrix (Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h at 4jC. The unbound
supernatant was removed and the beads were washed thrice with lysis
buffer. The precipitates were immunoblotted for hsp90.
Isolation of hsp90A on cell surface. MDA-MB-231 cells transfected
with hsp90a expression constructs cultured in RPMI 1640 (without serum)
were harvested by centrifugation (1,000 g, 10 min at 4jC) and washed twice
with ice-cold PBS. Proteins on the cell surface were labeled following the
protocol supplied by the manufacturer (PIERCE). Briefly, cells were
resuspended in EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (0.25 mg/mL) at 4jC for
30 min. The biotinylation reaction was terminated by addition of Quenching
Solution. After biotinylation, the cells were washed thrice with TBS, pelleted
by centrifugation, and solubilized in Lysis buffer. The cell lysates were

further disrupted by brief sonication. Solubilized biotinylated membrane
proteins from same amount of cell lyastes were captured using Immobilized
NeutrAvidin Gel, extensively washed with Wash Buffer, and resuspended in
2 SDS sample buffer before immunoblot analysis.
In vitro invasion assays. In vitro invasion assay were performed, as
previously described (12, 27) by using the Cultrex Cell Invasion Assay kit
(RandD Systems). In brief, serum-starved cells in 50 AL serum-free medium
with or without antibody or IgG were placed in the top chamber and
allowed to invade for 24 hour. The lower chambers (assay chamber) were
filled with 10% FBS medium. After incubation, migrated cells on the upper
chamber of the membrane were dissociated with cell dissociation solution
containing Calcein AM at 37jC for 1 h and read the bottom plate at 485 nm
excitation and 520 nm emission.
In vitro protein acetylation assay. Protein acetylation assays were
performed as described previously (28). Briefly, reactions (30 AL) were
carried out at 30jC for 1 h with M2 beads bound F-hsp90a (25 AL M2
beads mixed with 10 AL of in vitro–translated F-hsp90a and washed
thrice with HAT buffer) and 50 ng of p300 protein (Upstate) in HAT
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L DTT,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, and 50 nmol/L
acetyl-CoA (Sigma)]. After washing thrice with HAT buffer, the samples
were then subjected to Western blot analysis with anti–acetyl-lysine
antibody.
Confocal microscopy. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in a chamber
slide in RPMI with 10% FBS or under serum-free conditions with or without
40 nmol/L LBH589 for 16 h and stained with anti-acetyl (Ac)-K69 antibody.
Briefly, after 16 h incubation, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After this, the slides were blocked with 3%
bovine serum albumin for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody at a
dilution of 1:100 in blocking buffer for 2 h. After three washes with PBS, the
slides were incubated in Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(Molecular probes; Invitrogen) for 1 h at 1:3,000 dilution. After three washes

with PBS, the cells were counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) using Vectashield mountant with DAPI and imaged using Zeiss
LSM510 confocal microscope.

Results
Hyperacetylation of hsp90A involves p300 as the acetyltransferase. We first confirmed that hsp90 is acetylated both
in vitro and in vivo, as well as determined the HAT responsible for
inducing hyperacetylation of hsp90a. In HEK293 cells with ectopic
expression of F-hsp90a, treatment with the pan-HDAC inhibitors
LBH589 (Fig. 1A) or vorinostat (Fig. 1B) resulted in hyperacetylation of F-hsp90a. To determine whether p300 acts as the
HAT for hsp90a, after incubation with p300 and acetyl-CoA,
in vitro–translated hsp90a was analyzed for its acetylation status
by Western analysis with anti-AcK antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C,
p300 was necessary for the acetylation of hsp90a in the in vitro
assay. Immunoprecipitated F-hsp90 from LBH589-treated cells was
used as the positive control. In HEK293 cells, it was determined
that p300 can be coimmunoprecipitated with hsp90a (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Coincubation with p300 was discovered to dosedependently stimulate the acetylation of hsp90a (Fig. 1D). This was
not seen with PCAF (data not shown). However, knockdown of
p300 using siRNA only partially decreased LBH589-induced
acetylation of hsp90 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Therefore, p300
seemed not to be the sole but one of the HATs both for the in vitro
and in vivo acetylation of hsp90a.
Identity and functional significance of lysine residues in hsp90a
hyperacetylated by pan-HDAC inhibitors. Next, we determined the
identity of the acetylated lysine residues in hsp90a induced by

Figure 1. Treatment with pan-HDAC inhibitor induces acetylation of hsp90a, and p300 is the HAT for hsp90a. A and B, HEK293 cells were transfected with
either F-tagged hsp90a (3 Ag) or empty vector pcDNA3 and treated with the indicated concentration of LBH589 (LBH; A) or vorinostat (B ) for 24 h. IP with anti-F (M2 )
antibody–conjugated beads were immunoblotted (IB ) with either anti-rabbit acetyl lysine (AcK ) or anti-rabbit FLAG (F ) antibody. C, p300 acts as a histone
acetyl-transferase for hsp90a in vitro. The in vitro–translated hsp90a was incubated with the combination of recombinant p300 and Ac-CoA followed by immunoblotting
with anti-AcK antibody. The lane labeled ‘‘control’’ contained LBH589-induced acetylated F-hsp90a. D, p300 promotes acetylation of hsp90 in a dose-dependent
manner. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with F-hsp90a and the indicated amount of HA-tagged p300 (Ag). Immunoprecipitates with anti-M2 antibody were
immunoblotted with either anti-AcK or anti-F antibody. Immunoblots with anti-HA.11 or h-actin antibody served as loading control for p300 levels.

Figure 2. The individual K/R or K/Q substitutions do not affect the overall acetylation level of hsp90 but affect the ability of hsp90a to bind ATP, cochaperones,

with or without K/R substitutions, were treated with or without 100 nmol/L of LBH589. After this, immunoprecipitates with anti-F antibody were immunoblotted with
either anti-AcK or anti-F antibody. C and D, transfectants of F-hsp90a with K/Q (C ) but not K/R substitutions (D ) affect ATP binding of hsp90a. Precipitates from the
mixture of cell lysates containing hsp90a and ATP-sepharose were analyzed with anti-F antibody. Also, after transfections of F-hsp90a, with or without K/Q or
K/R substitutions, immunoprecipitates with anti-F antibody were immunoblotted with anti-CHIP, anti-p23, anti-hsp40, anti-hsp70, anti–c-Raf, or anti-F antibody.

HDAC inhibitor LBH589. HEK293 cells transfected with F-hsp90a
were treated with 100 nmol/L LBH589, and the acetylated
F-hsp90a was affinity immunopurified using anti-FLAG–conjugated
M2 agarose, followed by agarose beads bearing immobilized antiAcK antibody. The enriched acetylated hsp90a was analyzed by
nano high performance liquid chromatography/MS/MS in a mass
spectrometer. Seven acetylated lysine residues were identified in
hsp90a: K69, K100, K292, K327, K478, K546, and K558. Figure 2A
shows a three dimensional space-filling molecular structural model
of hsp90a, which shows that all of the identified lysine residues that
are acetylated reside on the surface and, thus, accessible for
modification.
To assess the effect of acetylation at the various lysine residues
on hsp90a function, point mutations were introduced to create
acetylation-deficient (lysine to arginine, K/R) and acetylationmimetic (lysine to glutamine, K/Q) mutants on the (F)-tagged
hsp90a. First, we determined whether any of the K/R point
mutations affects the overall hyperacetylation of F-hsp90a induced
by either the cotransfected p300 or by treatment with LBH589.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

None of the individual K/R mutants showed any change in the
hyperacetylation induced by either the cotransfected p300
(Supplementary Fig. S2) or by treatment with LBH589 (Fig. 2B).
These mutants were also analyzed for their ability to bind ATP, as
well as for binding to cochaperones, client proteins, and the
biotinylated B-GA (26). Although none of the K/R mutants
compromised the ATP binding of F-hsp90a (Fig. 2D), all but one
of the acetylation-mimetic mutants (K/Q) showed decreased
binding to ATP (Fig. 2C). The exception was the K292Q mutant,
which showed increased binding to ATP (Fig. 2C). The significance
of this is unclear, although K292 is in the hinge region at the
beginning of the MD of hsp90a, a region that is well-conserved
from yeast to human hsp90 (20, 29). Increased acetylation of hsp90
by a pan-HDAC inhibitor or HDAC6 siRNA had been shown to
inhibit the binding of hsp90 with cochaperones, e.g., p23, and client
proteins (18). Here, we found that acetylation-mimetic mutants
(K/Q) of the lysine residues in the MD, i.e., K100, K292, K327, K478,
K546, and K558, displayed decreased binding with the cochaperones p23 and to a lesser extent hsp40 (Fig. 2C). Although binding of

Acetylated Hsp90a in Tumor Cell Invasion

K/Q mutants at K69, K100, K327, K478, K546, and K558 to CHIP
was decreased, binding of K/Q mutant at K292 was not affected
(Fig. 2C). Additionally, binding of K/R mutants was similar to the
binding of wild-type hsp90a to CHIP (Fig. 2D). Acetylation-mimetic
mutants of hsp90a also showed disrupted binding to hsp70 and
with its client protein c-Raf, except with the K327Q mutant
(Fig. 2C). Binding of hsp70 and c-Raf to K/R mutants seemed to be
not significantly altered (Fig. 2D). In contrast, notably, the
acetylation-mimetic K/Q mutants showed increased binding to
B-GA (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with the observation that
acetylation of the endogenous hsp90a due to treatment with
LBH589 was associated with increase in B-GA binding of hsp90a in
MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 3B). LBH589-induced hsp90 acetylation in
MDA-MB-468 cells also promoted 17-AAG binding to the
acetylated endogenous hsp90 because B-GA binding to hsp90
was reduced by 17-AAG treatment more in those cells exposed to

LBH589 compared with those that were unexposed (Fig. 3C and D,
top). Also, after treatment with LBH589, each K/R mutant of
hsp90a showed increased binding to B-GA, which could not be
displaced by cotreatment with 17-AAG, suggesting decreased
binding of K/R mutants to 17-AAG (Fig. 3D).
Role of lysine hyperacetylation in extracellular location of
hsp90A. Previous reports have shown that the inducible isoform
hsp90a, but not hsp90h, can be secreted and found on the surface
of cancer cells, although it lacks the classic signal sequence (12, 30).
Serum starvation, hypoxia, high concentration of glucose, as well as
oxidative stress have all been shown to promote the export and
extracellular location of hsp90a (30–32). Consistent with these
reports, our findings show that serum starvation of breast cancer
T47D cells promoted secretion and extracellular localization of the
endogenous hsp90a (Fig. 4A), as well as of the ectopically
expressed F-hsp90a (Fig. 4B). Notably, under both circumstances,

Figure 3. LBH589-induced acetylation increases B-GA and 17-AAG binding to hsp90a. A, individual K/Q substitutions increase hsp90a binding to B-GA. Cell
lysates from Fig. 2D were also incubated with B-GA, followed by streptavidin-coated agarose beads, and eluted proteins were analyzed with anti-F antibody.
B, LBH589 increases hsp90 binding to GA and induces hsp90 acetylation dose-dependently. MB-468 cells cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS were treated with the
indicated concentration of LBH589 for 16 h. After this, cell lysates were incubated with B-GA, followed by streptavidin-coated agarose beads, and eluted proteins
were analyzed with anti-hsp90a antibody. Acetylation and expression level of endogenous hsp90 were detected with anti-AcK and anti-hsp90 antibody, respectively.
C, LBH589 treatment preferentially increases hsp90a binding to 17-AAG. MB-468 cells ectopically expressing F-hsp90a were treated with 100 nmol/L of LBH589
for 16 h. After this, equal amount of cell lysates were incubated with the indicated doses of 17-AAG for 30 min at 4jC, followed by incubation with B-GA and streptavidincoated agarose beads. Precipitates from streptavidin-coated beads were analyzed with anti-F antibody. D, individual K/R substitution disrupted the affinity of
LBH589-treated hsp90a for 17-AAG. After treatment with either vehicle or 100 nmol/L of LBH589, cell lysates from HEK293 cells expressing F-hsp90 or K/R
substitutions were incubated with vehicle or 50 nmol/L of 17-AAG followed by incubation with B-GA and streptavidin-coated agarose beads. Precipitates from

hsp90a was acetylated (Fig. 4A and B). Notably, treatment with
LBH589, in a dose-dependent manner, also promoted and
increased the export and extracellular localization of hyperacetylated hsp90a from T47D cells into the culture medium
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). These data indicate that hyperacetylation stimulates the extracellular export of hsp90a. To further verify
this, we determined the export and extracellular location of
acetylation mimetic (K/Q) or acetylation-resistant (K/R) mutants
transfected into T47D cells that were cultured under serum-free
condition. As shown, K69Q, K100Q, and K558Q substitutions
promoted the export and extracellular location of hsp90a, whereas
K/R substitutions at the same residues markedly reduced the
export and extracellular location of hsp90a (Fig. 4C). Cotreatment
of cells transfected with K/R mutants with LBH589 increased the

export and extracellular location of K/R mutants of hsp90a to a
variable extent, with K100R and K558R mutants showing less
export than the other mutants (Supplementary Fig. S3B ).
Immunoblot analysis of the solubilized biotinylated membrane
proteins also showed that acetylation-mimetic mutants K69Q,
K100Q, K327Q, and K558Q exist more on the cell surface compared
with the wild-type hsp90 (Fig. 4D).
Extracellular hyperacetylated hsp90A binds MMP-2 and
promotes tumor cell invasion. In cancer cells, extracellular
hsp90a was shown to act as a chaperone and assist in the
maturation of the MMP-2 to its active form (12). Consistent with
this, our findings show that K/Q mutants expressed in MB-231
cells, especially K69Q, K100Q, and K558Q, which are preferentially
extracellular under serum-free culture conditions, bind MMP-2 in

Figure 4. Acetylation-dependent extracellular localization of hsp90a. A, serum starvation of T47D breast cancer cells promotes extracellular localization of hsp90a.
Concentrated extracellular medium or cell lysates from T47D cells, which were either serum starved or cultured in 10% FBS, were immunoblotted with anti-hsp90a
antibody. h-actin served as a loading control. A, right and B, under starvation, both endogenous (A, right ) and exogenous hsp90a (B ) are secreted from T47D
cells in the acetylated form. Extracellular hsp90a was immunoprecipitated with anti-AcK antibody and immunoblotted with either anti-hsp90a or M2 antibody. C, in
serum-starved T47D cells, K/R substitutions at K69, K100, and K558 decrease, whereas K/Q substitutions increase the level of extracellular hsp90a. Supernatants
of serum-starved T47D cells transfected with the indicated F-tagged hsp90a mutant constructs were concentrated and immunoblotted with anti-F antibody.
Coomassie-stained nonspecific proteins served as the loading control. D, K/Q substitution affects hsp90 expression on cell surface. MB-231 cells transfected with
the indicated constructs were cultured under serum-free condition for 24 h and followed by the labeling of surface protein with biotinylation. Biotinylated hsp90 on
cell surface was detected with anti-F antibody. Biotinylated actin on cell surface served as loading control. Supernatants of serum-starved MB-231 cells transfected with
the indicated F-tagged K/Q hsp90a mutant constructs were also concentrated and immunoprecipitates with anti-F antibody–conjugated beads were immunoblotted
with anti–MMP-2 antibody.

Acetylated Hsp90a in Tumor Cell Invasion

the extracellular medium (Fig. 4D). Overall, these data indicate that
acetylation promotes not only the extracellular location of
hsp90a but also facilitates its chaperone association with MMP2. Next, we determined whether following treatment with sublethal
concentrations of pan-HDAC-inhibitor–increased extracellular
levels of acetylated hsp90a increases invasiveness of cancer cells.
Figure 5A shows that treatment with LBH589 dose dependently
increased Matrigel invasion by MB-231 cells. This was associated
with increased extracellular binding of acetylated hsp90a with
MMP-2 (Fig. 5B). Similar increase in the invasiveness of MB-468
cells was observed after treatment with LBH589 or SAHA (Fig. 5C).
We next determined whether increased extracellular location of
K69Q, K100Q, or K558Q mutant promotes in vitro invasiveness of
breast cancer cells. For this, we created stable transfectants of MB468 cells expressing the wild-type hsp90a, or the K/Q or K/R
mutants of hsp90a at the residues K69, K100, and K558, and their
in vitro invasiveness in the Matrigel-based assay was evaluated. As
compared with the MB-468 cells expressing the wild-type hsp90a,
stable transfectants of MB-468 cells with K/Q but not K/R mutants
at K69, K100, and K558 showed increased in vitro invasiveness
(Fig. 5D).
Treatment with anti-AcK hsp90A antibody inhibits in vitro
invasion by breast cancer cells. The findings above raised the
possibility that treatment with an antibody to acetylated (Ac)
hsp90a would inhibit binding of hsp90a to MMP-2 that is involved
in tumor invasiveness. Therefore, the anti–Ac-hsp90a would
thereby inhibit invasiveness of breast cancer cells. To verify this,
first we compared the extracellular location of the ectopically
expressed K69Q mutant versus the wild-type hsp90a in the breast
cancer MB-231 cells. As shown, compared with the location of the
wild-type hsp90a, which is mostly intracellular (extracellular to
intracellular ratio of 13.1), relatively more of the K69Q mutant
hsp90a was extracellular (extracellular to intracellular ratio of 1.9;
Fig. 6A). Next, a polyclonal antibody was generated against the
acetylated K69-containing peptide of hsp90a (anti–Ac-K69). The
specificity of the antibody was confirmed by determining its ability
to detect the increase in the acetylation of the ecotopically
expressed (Fig. 6B, top) or endogenous hsp90a (Fig. 6B, bottom),
after treatment with the HDAC inhibitor LBH589. As shown, after
treatment of cells with LBH589, the anti–Ac-K69 hsp90a antibody
recognized the increase in the acetylated hsp90a (Fig. 6B).
Importantly, the anti–Ac-K69 hsp90a antibody selectively recognized acetylated hsp90a (Supplementary Fig. S4A). In contrast, the
commercially available polyclonal anti-hsp90a antibody nonspecifically recognized both the acetylated and unacetylated hsp90a,
without showing specific increase in the epitope detection after
treatment of the cells with serum-starved condition or with
LBH589 (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Therefore, this raised the
possibility that the anti–Ac-K69 antibody might be more selective
in attenuating the role of Ac-hsp90a in the invasiveness of cancer
cells. Figure 6C shows that, compared with the control IgG–treated
or untreated MB-231 cells, serum-starved MB-231 cells showed
surface location of the acetylated hsp90a when stained with the
anti–Ac-K69 antibody (Fig. 6C). Additionally, treatment of serumstarved MB-231 cells with LBH589 led to increased levels of the
membrane-associated acetylated hsp90a, as detected by the anti–
Ac-K69 antibody. Next, we compared the effect of anti-hsp90a with
anti–Ac-K69 hsp90a antibody on the in vitro invasiveness of
MB-231 breast cancer cells. Figure 6D clearly shows that, although
the control IgG had no significant effect and the commercially
available polyclonal anti-hsp90a antibody only modestly inhibited

www.aacrjournals.org

the in vitro invasiveness of MB-231 cells, treatment with the anti–
Ac-K69 hsp90a markedly inhibited the Matrigel invasion by MB231 cells (Fig. 6D). Thus, acetylation of K69 in hsp90a may play an
important role in extracellular location and chaperone association
of hsp90a with MMP-2. Additionally, exposure to anti–Ac-K69
hsp90a antibody could inhibit invasion of breast cancer cells.

Discussion
Recently, the hsp90 ortholog in the yeast was shown to physically
or genetically interact with at least 10% of the yeast proteome (33).
By analogy, hsp90 is increasingly recognized as a chaperone and
master regulator for the key cell signaling networks or cellular
transcription in human cells, especially in the transformed cells
(34). Hyperacetylation of hsp90 resulting from inhibition of HDAC6
has been shown to inhibit the ATP, cochaperone p23, and client
protein binding of hsp90. This directs the client proteins, including
several oncoprotein signaling kinases and nuclear hormone
receptors to polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation
(17, 18, 35–37). Although it is likely that not all of the known
hsp90 client proteins would be uniformly affected (38), posttranslational modifications of hsp90 such as phosphorylation and
acetylation influence the chaperone function of hsp90, thereby
affecting the signaling networks that govern the malignant
phenotype and response to therapy of cancer cells (39). By using
mass spectrometry on hsp90a isolated from HDAC inhibitor–
treated cells, we could document hyperacetylation of surfaceresiding seven-lysine residues in the NH2 terminus and the MD of
hsp90a. Unlike a previous report, in our study, under the
experimental conditions we used for mass spectrometry studies,
K294 was not found to be acetylated in hsp90a (20). Most likely this
is so because different tryptic digestion protocols and different
HDAC inhibitors were used in the two studies. Therefore, there may
have been preservation and detection of K294 acetylation in the
previous report and not of the other acetylated lysine residues
identified in our study (20). In the previous report, authors had
conjectured that lysine residues other than K294 may also be
involved in the acetylation/deacetylation modification (20).
Although other HATs may be involved, in the present studies, we
also determined that p300 is one of the HATs involved in
acetylating hsp90a.
In our studies, all but one of the acetylation-mimetic mutants
showed decreased binding to ATP. The exception was the K292Q
mutant, which showed increased binding to ATP. Most K/Q
mutants of the lysine residues in the MD, i.e., K292, K478, K546, and
K558, displayed decreased binding to p23, hsp40, hsp70, as well as
with the client protein c-Raf. Binding to CHIP, which is a COOHterminal–interacting protein of hsp70 (40), was also disrupted.
Conversely, the K/Q mutants showed increased binding to B-GA.
This suggests that charge neutralization at the lysine residues in
the MD of hsp90a decreases the ATP and cochaperone binding but
increases GA binding. Consistent with this, treatment with LBH589,
which dose dependently induced hyperacetylation of hsp90, also
increased the B-GA binding to hsp90a in a dose-dependent
manner. In a previous report, we showed that cotreatment with a
pan-HDAC inhibitor enhances antileukemia effects of 17-AAG
with greater depletion of hsp90 client proteins in the leukemia
cells (41). This strongly suggested that hyperacetylation of hsp90
could augment 17-AAG binding to hsp90 and inhibition of its
chaperone function, resulting in superior antileukemia activity of
the combination of HDAC inhibitor and 17-AAG. Indeed, in

invasion. Columns, average results of three independent experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05.

LBH589-treated cells, 17-AAG was able to more efficiently displace
B-GA, indicating increased affinity of the hyperacetylated hsp90a
for binding to 17-AAG. However, for unclear reasons, this was not
observed in LBH589-treated K/R mutants of hsp90a. Overall, these
observations create a rationale to determine the in vivo activity of
the combination of HA-HDI and 17-AAG against human leukemia
cells.
Recently, hsp90 was shown to be present on the surface of
metastatic melanoma cells (42). It is the inducible isoform hsp90a,
not hsp90h, which is secreted and present on the surface of cancer
cells (12). Serum starvation of breast cancer cells promoted
secretion and extracellular localization of the endogenous or
ectopically expressed hsp90a, which was notably hyperacetylated
under these circumstances. LBH589 treatment also promoted the
export and extracellular localization of hyperacetylated hsp90a
into the culture medium. Although it lacks the classic signal
sequence, the hyperacetylated hsp90a is extracellular. Our data
also show that K69Q, K100Q, and K558Q substitutions promote the
export and extracellular location of hsp90a, whereas K/R
substitutions at the same residues markedly reduce the export
and extracellular location of hsp90a. To a variable extent,
treatment with LBH589 was also able to induce the export and
extracellular location of the K/R mutants of hsp90a. Thus,
acetylation status of hsp90a at specific sites may influence the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

extracellular localization of hsp90a. Although hsp70, p23, cdc37,
and Hip (hsp70 interacting protein) have also been detected in the
extracellular environment of tumor cells, their precise function in
this location has not been elucidated (30, 43). Whether ATP
binding and hydrolysis is required for the extracellular chaperone
function of hsp90a remains to be determined.
Extracellular hsp90a acts as a chaperone and assists in the
maturation of the MMP-2 to its active form (12). Our data also
show that acetylation promotes not only the extracellular location
of hsp90a but also facilitates its chaperone association with MMP2. Acetylation-mimetic mutants K69Q, K100Q, and K558Q exist
more on the cell surface compared with the wild-type hsp90a.
Therefore, HDAC inhibitor mediated hyperacetylation of the
endogenous hsp90a at these residues most likely promotes binding
and maturation of MMP-2. This is supported by the observation
that K/Q mutants, especially at K69, K100, and K558 residues, bind
MMP-2 in the extracellular medium. Eustace and colleagues (12)
had clearly documented that the presence of hsp90a on the cell
surface was critical for the in vitro invasiveness of HT-1080
fibrosarcoma cells (13–30). We further elucidate that sublethal
concentrations of LBH589, which was associated with increased
extracellular binding of acetylated hsp90a with MMP-2, increased
invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Increased extracellular localization and chaperone association of K69Q, K100Q, and K558Q with

Acetylated Hsp90a in Tumor Cell Invasion

MMP-2 also promoted in vitro invasiveness by breast cancer cells.
Previous studies have shown that treatment with extracellularly
restricted GA beads, designed to inhibit extracellular chaperone
function of hsp90a, decreased active MMP-2 levels and inhibited
invasiveness of cancer cells by 80% (12). Here, we generated a novel
antibody against the acetylated K69 containing hsp90a peptide.
This anti–Ac-K69 hsp90a antibody specifically recognizes the
acetylated and not the unacetylated endogenous hsp90a on the cell
surface. Exposure to this antibody markedly inhibited the in vitro
Matrigel invasion by breast cancer cells, and this effect was
superior to the inhibition observed with the commercially available
anti-hsp90a antibody. This evidence supports that acetylation of
K69 plays an important role in extracellular chaperone association
of hsp90a with MMP-2, which may regulate invasion by breast
cancer cells.

Serum starvation, hypoxia, high concentrations of glucose, and
oxidative stress have all been shown to promote the export and
extracellular location of hsp90a (13, 16, 32). Under cellular stress,
the intracellular signaling events result in phosphorylation or
hyperacetylation of hsp90a. Under serum- and nutrient-depleted,
hypoxia-stressed environment, in the established primaries, hsp90a
is likely to be hyperacetylated and extracellular. Boyault and
colleagues (44) have recently shown that cellular stress and
increased levels of misfolded polyubiquitylated proteins in cancer
cells triggers the dissociation of a repressive HDAC6/heat shock
factor 1 (HSF1)/hsp90 complex and a subsequent HSF1 activation,
which induces the expression of major cellular chaperones.
Dissociation of the complex also induces hsp90a acetylation,
which would export hsp90a to the cell surface. Extracellularly, it
would bind and promote the maturation of MMP-2, thereby

antibody specifically recognizes acetylated form of both exogenous and endogenous hsp90a expressed in MB-231 cells. MB-231 cells were transfected with F-hsp90a
followed by the treatment with LBH589. Immunoprecipitates of F-hsp90a with anti–M2-conjugated beads were immunoblotted with anti–Ac-K69-hsp90a antibody for
the acetylation status and anti-F antibody for F-hsp90a expression. Cells transfected with empty vector followed the treatment with LBH589 served as control for
specificity. Acetylation of endogenous hsp90a induced by LBH589 was also detected with anti–Ac-K69-hsp90a antibody (bottom ). Immunoprecipitates of endogenous
hsp90a with anti-hsp90a antibody from cell lysates of MB-231 cells treated with or without LBH589 were immunoblotted with either anti–Ac-K69-hsp90a or anti-hsp90a

facilitating invasion and metastasis. Parenthetically, activation of
HSF1 and heat shock response by proteotoxic stress was identified
as a potent modifier of tumorigenesis and required for tumor
initiation and maintenance in cancer cells, highlighting a nononcogene addictive stress phenotype of cancer cells (45, 46). A
recent report showed that in a multivariate analysis, the level of
hsp90 expression was an independent prognostic factor of survival
in patients with breast cancer (47). Our findings raise the
possibility that, due to intratumoral stress in the primary breast
cancers, increased expression, hyperacetylation, and extracellular
location of hsp90a promotes MMP maturation, increased tumor
invasion, and metastasis. This may be responsible for the overall
negative effect of high hsp90a expression on the survival in
breast cancer patients. Therefore, perhaps it is the expression of
