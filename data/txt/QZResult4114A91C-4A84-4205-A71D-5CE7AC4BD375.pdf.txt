Mediates the Selective Radiosensitization Effect of
Parthenolide in Prostate Cancer Cells

Abstract
Cancer cells are usually under higher oxidative stress compared with normal cells. We hypothesize that introducing additional reactive oxygen species (ROS) insults or suppressing antioxidant capacity may selectively
enhance cancer cell killing by oxidative stress–generating agents through stress overload or stress sensitization,
whereas normal cells may be able to maintain redox homeostasis under exogenous ROS by adaptive response.
Here, we show that parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone, selectively exhibits a radiosensitization effect on prostate cancer PC3 cells but not on normal prostate epithelial PrEC cells. Parthenolide causes oxidative stress in PC3
cells but not in PrEC cells, as determined by the oxidation of the ROS-sensitive probe H2DCFDA and intracellular
reduced thiol and disulfide levels. In PC3 but not PrEC cells, parthenolide activates NADPH oxidase, leading to a
decrease in the level of reduced thioredoxin, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and consequent FOXO3a phosphorylation, which results in the downregulation of FOXO3a targets antioxidant enzyme manganese
superoxide dismutase and catalase. Importantly, when combined with radiation, parthenolide further increases
ROS levels in PC3 cells whereas it decreases radiation-induced oxidative stress in PrEC cells, possibly by increasing reduced glutathione levels. Together, the results show that parthenolide selectively activates NADPH oxidase
and mediates intense oxidative stress in prostate cancer cells by both increasing ROS generation and decreasing
antioxidant defense capacity. The results support the concept of exploiting the intrinsic differences in the redox
status of cancer cells and normal cells as targets for selective cancer killing. Cancer Res; 70(7); 2880–90. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Selectively killing cancer without harming normal tissue is
a fundamental challenge in cancer therapy. Elevated oxidative stress and aberrant redox homeostasis are frequently observed in cancer cells compared with their normal cell
counterparts. For example, prostate cancer cells often have
increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from mitochondria (1) or NADPH oxidase (2), and decreased antioxidant enzymes, such as manganese superoxide dismutase
(MnSOD), CuZnSOD, and catalase (3, 4). A small shift toward
an oxidizing condition in cells may lead to elevated proliferation and induction of adaptive response. However, a high
oxidizing condition often results in cell injury and cell death.
Persistent high ROS in cancer cells often leads to increased
cell proliferation and adaptive responses that may contribute
to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and treatment resistance. FurAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Graduate Center for Toxicology, 2College of

ther exposure to exogenous ROS is hypothesized as pushing
tumor cells, which already have high constitutive oxidative
stress levels, to cell death, whereas normal cells may still
maintain redox homeostasis through adaptive responses.
Therefore, regulating intracellular redox state may represent
an ideal strategy to selectively sensitize cancer cells to oxidative stress–inducing therapy, such as radiotherapy.
Parthenolide is a sesquiterpene lactone derived from the
traditional herbal medicine feverfew. The biological activity
of parthenolide is thought to be mediated through its αmethylene-γ-lactone moiety, which can react with nucleophiles, especially with cysteine thiol groups, in a Michael
addition reaction. Thiols (-SH) are important in integrating intracellular redox changes with cellular signaling transduction
pathways. Several regulatory proteins, such as kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors, have cysteines on their
active sites. Oxidation and reduction of cysteine thiols affect
protein functions or act as the molecular switch for their
downstream signaling cascades (5). The chemical properties
of parthenolide make it a good candidate for modifying cellular
redox signaling and give it great potential in cancer therapy.
Oxidative stress is a major mechanism for parthenolideinduced cell death (6). Our previous study showed that parthenolide sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to radiation
treatment by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway (7). However,

cells, and whether parthenolide differentially regulates intracellular redox state in cancer and normal cells are unknown.
NADPH oxidase is an important source of ROS, which
accounts, at least partially, for increased levels of ROS in prostate cancer (2, 8). The first discovered NADPH oxidase is
phagocyte NADPH oxidase. It is a multisubunit enzyme localized in cell membranes, consisting of membrane-bound components (gp91phox and p22phox) and cytosolic components
(p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac) that translocate to the
membrane upon activation. Homologues of gp91phox (Nox2),
including Nox1-5, Duox1 (dual oxidase), and Duox2, have
been identified and named Nox (NADPH oxidase) proteins
in nonphagocytic cells. Their activation requires p47phox paralogue Noxo1 (Nox organizer 1) and p67phox paralogue Noxa1
(Nox activator 1), or calcium binding (9). Nox proteins catalyze the transfer of an electron to O2 to generate O2. −, which is
then dismutated to H2O2. It has been shown that prostate tumor is more likely (86%) to have Nox1 staining compared with
benign prostate tissue (62%; refs. 8, 10) and that Nox-induced
ROS is an important contributor to X-ray radiation–induced
cell death (11, 12). Whether parthenolide activates NADPH
oxidase in prostate cancer cells is unknown.
In a previous study, we found that parthenolide activates
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in
prostate cancer cells (7). Although activated Akt is known
to inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival, recent studies
suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway may induce oxidative
stress and trigger cell death under certain conditions (13).
The mechanisms by which Akt induces ROS may involve
the stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and
reduction of antioxidant defense through FOXO suppression.
The FOXO transcription factors are mammalian homologues of DAF-16, which regulates longevity in Caenorhabditis
elegans. Among the four FOXO family members (FOXO1,
FOXO3a, FOXO4, and FOXO6), FOXO1 and FOXO3a are the
most highly expressed FOXO proteins in human prostate
(14). The downstream targets of FOXOs may be involved in cell
cycle and cell death regulation, differentiation and development, cellular stress response, and energy metabolism control
(15, 16). Overexpression of FOXO1 and FOXO3a in a prostate
cancer cell line provokes apoptosis (17). However, FOXOs also
extend mammalian life span by protecting cells against oxidative stress–induced cell death (18). As the cellular functions of
FOXOs are diverse and in some cases antagonistic, it is postulated that the activity of FOXOs is differentially regulated in
response to various types or intensities of external stimuli
(19). Phosphorylation of FOXO by Akt is inhibitory, which allows the chaperone protein 14-3-3 to bind to FOXOs in the
nucleus and enhances FOXO nuclear export, leading to cytoplasmic sequestration. On the contrary, phosphorylation of
FOXO by mammalian Ste20-like kinase and c-Jun-NH2-kinase
is activatory, which disrupts 14-3-3 binding and triggers FOXO
nuclear translocation. Radiation induces FOXO3a nuclear
translocation and activates FOXO3a activity (20, 21). Activation of FOXO3a by radiation may induce apoptosis by upregulating its targets, FasL and Bim (20); it may also protect cells
against oxidative damage and genotoxic stress by upregulating antioxidant proteins, such as MnSOD, catalase, peroxire-

doxin III, and sestrin 3 (13, 18, 22, 23), and promoting DNA
damage repair (21, 24, 25).
In this study, we explored how parthenolide differently
modulates intracellular redox status in prostate cancer and
normal prostate cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatment. Human prostate cancer cell
lines PC3 and DU145 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and were cultured as previously described
(7). Human normal prostate epithelial PrEC cells were purchased from Lonza and were maintained in PrEGM medium
(Lonza). Parthenolide, NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene
iodonium (DPI, Sigma), and PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Cell
Signaling) were dissolved in DMSO.
MTT assay. Cells were treated with parthenolide for 24 h
and exposed to radiation or were sham irradiated. Twentyfour hours after radiation, the parthenolide-containing medium was replaced with normal culturing medium for a total
parthenolide treatment of 48 h. After four cell doubling times
(∼4 d for PC3 cells and 8 d for PrEC cells; ref. 26), MTT assay
was performed as previously described (7).
Cell growth curve. Cells were treated as described above
for the MTT assay. The mean number of cells per well was
obtained every other day after radiation from the triplicate
average. The results were plotted on a log-linear scale and
fitted into an exponential growth curve.
Dichlorofluorescein assay. Dichlorofluorescein (DCF)
assay was performed using carboxy-H2DCFDA (sensitive to
oxidation; Invitrogen) and oxidized carboxy-DCFDA (insensitive to oxidation; Invitrogen) as optimized by Wan
and colleagues (27). The fluorescence in cells preloaded with
carboxy-H2DCFDA was normalized to that in cells preloaded
with carboxy-DCFDA (ratio of H2DCFDA/DCFDA) to control
for the cell number, dye uptake, and ester cleavage differences between different treatment groups.
Detection of reduced thiols and disulfides. Protein thiols
were labeled by 3-N-maleimido-propionyl biocytin (MPB) and
detected by avidin-biotin technology on the blots as previously described by Bayer and colleagues (28). To detect protein
disulfides, samples were first treated with N-ethylmaleimide
(Sigma) to block the free thiol groups. Then, 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) was added to reduce the disulfide bond. The Nethylmaleimide–blocked, 2-mercaptoethanol–reduced
protein was then treated with MPB for disulfide labeling. Labeled proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated streptavidin.
NADPH oxidase activity assay. This assay was performed
as previously described by Cui and Douglas (29). Photoemission generated by the reaction of superoxide radical and
lucigenin in terms of relative luminescence units (RLU) was
measured every minute for 15 min. Reaction velocity was
calculated as the change of RLU per minute per microgram
of protein.
Glutathione assay. Total glutathione (GSHt) and oxidized
glutathione (GSSG) were measured using the recycling assay
of the Glutathione Assay kit (Cayman Chemical). The

amount of reduced GSH was calculated by subtracting the
amount of GSSG from total GSH (GSHt − 2GSSG).
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (7) using corresponding antibodies against Akt and phospho-Akt (Ser473), FOXO3a and
phospho-FOXO3a (Ser253; Cell Signaling), actin (Sigma),
Nox1 (Santa Cruz), catalase (Santa Cruz), and MnSOD (Upstate). Representative blots and quantification from three independent experiments are shown.
Knocking down Nox1 using small interfering RNA. Cells
were transiently transfected with Nox1 small interfering RNA
(siRNA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and control siRNA by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the MnSOD promoter region
containing consensus FOXO3a binding element (DBE, Daf-16
family protein–binding element; 5′-TTCTGACGTCTGTAAACAAGCCCAGCCCTT-3′; ref. 18) were labeled with [ 32 P]
ATP. The assay was performed as previously described (7).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Cells were collected and processed using ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif). Fixed
protein/DNA complexes were sheared and precipitated using
anti-FOXO3a antibody (Cell Signaling). The MnSOD promoter fragment containing DBE was amplified. The sequences of
primer set were as follows: upper-strand primer, 5′-CACCCCAACACGTAGCCCTAGTTACATTC-3′; lower-strand primer,
5′-CTAGGCTTCCGGTAAGTGGAATGGGAAAAC-3′.
SOD mimetic treatment and colony survival assay. Cells
were treated with parthenolide or DMSO for 24 h before radiation exposure. Twenty-four hours after radiation, normal
culture medium replaced the medium containing parthenolide. SOD mimetic (MnTE-2-PyP5+) was added concurrently
with parthenolide and kept in the medium throughout. Colony survival assay was conducted as previously described (7).
FOXO3a transient transfection and determination of cell
survival by trypan blue exclusion assay. Cells were transfected with HA-FOXO3a-WT (wild-type), HA-FOXO3a-TM (triple mutant; Addgene; ref. 15), or pECE vector control plasmid
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). HA-FOXO3a-TM has
three mutations at Akt phosphorylation sites (Thr32, Ser253,
and Ser315), leading to constitutively active FOXO3a. After
transfection, the medium was replaced with complete medium
with or without parthenolide and incubated overnight. Cells
were then treated with 6 Gy radiation or were sham irradiated.
Forty-eight hours after radiation, cells were processed for trypan
blue exclusion assay and collected for Western blot analysis.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed
using either Student's t test (for two-group comparison) or
one-way ANOVA (for multiple-group comparison). Data were
reported as mean ± SEM.

Results
The radiosensitization effect of parthenolide is selective
to prostate cancer PC3 cells but not to normal prostate epithelial PrEC cells. Previously, we showed that parthenolide
synergistically enhances the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells

2882

to radiation treatment using colony survival assay (7). In the
present study, we compared the effect of parthenolide in prostate cancer PC3 cells and normal prostate epithelial PrEC cells.
Because PrEC cells did not form colonies in vitro, we performed MTT assay under the growth condition that provided
a relative cell survival comparable with the clonogenic assays
(7). PrEC cells are more resistant to parthenolide-induced cytotoxicity compared with PC3 cells (Fig. 1A). The subcytotoxic
dose of parthenolide (1 μmol/L) was chosen to study the combination effect of parthenolide and radiation on cell survival.
As shown in Fig. 1B, 6 Gy radiation decreases cell viability in
PC3 cells (by 53%) and in PrEC cells (by 41%). Parthenolide
(1 μmol/L) reduces cell viability and enhances radiationinduced cytotoxicity in PC3 cells but not in PrEC cells. Comparisons of growth curves for these two cell lines also reveal a
selective radiosensitization effect of parthenolide (Fig. 1C) in
PC3 cells. Radiation (6 Gy) decreases cell growth rate by ∼50%
in both cell lines (Fig. 1D). Parthenolide alone decreases cell
number without obvious change in growth rate in both cell lines.
A combination of parthenolide and radiation shows radiosensitization in PC3 cells by both decreased cell number and lower
growth rate. However, the growth rate in the combination treatment group is the same as the untreated group for PrEC cells.
Parthenolide induces oxidative stress in PC3 cells but
not in PrEC cells. We then explored potential determinants
for the selectivity of the effect of parthenolide. Because oxidative stress is the major mechanism for both parthenolideinduced (6) and radiation-induced cell death, we compared
the effect of parthenolide on cellular ROS level in PC3 and
PrEC cells by DCF assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, radiation significantly increases normalized carboxy-H2DCFDA fluorescence,
a general indicator of cellular ROS level, in both PC3 and PrEC
cells. However, parthenolide alone increases the ROS level in
prostate cancer PC3 cells but not in normal prostate PrEC
cells. When combined with radiation, parthenolide further
increases the cellular ROS level in PC3 cells, consistent with
the radiosensitization effect. Interestingly, in PrEC cells,
parthenolide decreases radiation-induced ROS level (significant at 5 μmol/L), suggesting an antioxidant response.
Parthenolide exerts its effect mainly by targeting thiol
groups, which may lead to the depletion of intracellular glutathione and protein thiols and induction of ROS (6, 30).
We therefore detected the presence of protein thiols and
disulfides in PC3 and PrEC cells by MPB labeling. As shown
in Fig. 2B, 5 μmol/L parthenolide significantly decreases reduced protein thiols and increases disulfide staining in PC3
cells. The decrease in the reduced protein thiols may result
from the direct reaction of parthenolide with protein thiols
or the oxidation of thiol groups due to parthenolide-induced oxidative stress. Interestingly, in PrEC cells, parthenolide does not significantly change the protein thiols and
disulfides levels, which is consistent with the selective induction of oxidative stress in PC3 cells.
Parthenolide activates NADPH oxidase in PC3 cells but
not in PrEC cells. Oxidative stress is the imbalance between
prooxidants and antioxidants. Both increased production of
ROS and decreased antioxidants can lead to oxidative stress.

is NADPH oxidase (2, 8). We measured NADPH oxidase activity
to probe whether it is involved in parthenolide-induced oxidative stress in prostate cancer PC3 cells. Our results (Fig. 2C)
show that parthenolide enhances NADPH oxidase activity
dose dependently in PC3 cells, which can be inhibited by DPI,
a NADPH oxidase inhibitor. However, in PrEC cells, NADPH
oxidase activity is not significantly affected by parthenolide.
Parthenolide decreases reduced thioredoxin in PC3 cells
as a downstream event of NADPH oxidase activation but
increases glutathione in PrEC cells. Because parthenolide
targets thiols, we also detected two important thiol-containing
small-molecule antioxidants, GSH and thioredoxin. As shown in
Fig. 3A, total GSH level is slightly increased in PC3 cells and significantly increased in PrEC cells by parthenolide. The reduced
GSH/GSSG ratio is not significantly changed by parthenolide in
PC3 cells but is increased 2.4-fold in PrEC cells, which may lead
to the protective effect against radiation-induced oxidative
stress observed by DCF assay. Our result is contrary to a report
that parthenolide can deplete intracellular GSH in cancer cells
(6). Because the reactivities of thiol groups are inversely related to their pKa, parthenolide may more readily react with protein thiols that have low pKa than with GSH, which has a high
pKa of 8.8. The induction of GSH may be due to the activation
of the Nrf2/ARE (antioxidant/electrophile response element)
pathway (31) because Keap1, the negative regulator of Nrf2,
contains numerous low pKa cysteines (32).
Globally decreased protein thiols have been observed in
PC3 cells but not in PrEC cells after parthenolide treatment
(Fig. 2B). We examined reduced thioredoxin, the active form
of thioredoxin, by using thioredoxin antibody to pull down

the thiol-labeled protein sample. Parthenolide significantly
decreases reduced thioredoxin in PC3 cells without altering
the thioredoxin protein amount (Fig. 3B). However, in the
presence of DPI, the decrease caused by parthenolide in
the reduced thioredoxin is abolished, suggesting that this is
a downstream event of NADPH oxidase activation. It is likely
that thioredoxin was oxidized by Nox-derived ROS.
Activation of NADPH oxidase by parthenolide is upstream of PI3K/Akt activation in PC3 cells. The PI3K/Akt
pathway has been known to be activated by growth factors
and oxidative stress (33), so we tested whether activation of
the PI3K/Akt pathway is a downstream event of NADPH oxidase
activation in PC3 cells. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin prevents
activation of Akt by parthenolide, as indicated by the decrease
of p-Akt/Akt ratio. However, activation of NADPH oxidase by
parthenolide is not affected (Fig. 4A). We then identified Nox1
as the major Nox isoform in PC3 cells by real-time PCR (data
not shown). Knocking down Nox1 by siRNA inhibits both
parthenolide-induced NADPH oxidase activation and Akt
activation (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Nox1-dependent NADPH
oxidase activation by parthenolide is upstream of PI3K/Akt
activation. This was further confirmed by using the NADPH
oxidase inhibitor DPI. In the presence of DPI, Akt activation
by parthenolide and phosphorylation of FOXO3a, the downstream target of Akt kinase, are both prevented (Fig. 4C).
Activation of Akt by parthenolide induces FOXO3a phosphorylation and suppresses its downstream targets, antioxidant enzymes MnSOD and catalase, in prostate cancer
cells but not in PrEC cells. FOXO3a is a main target of activated Akt. There are three conserved Akt phosphorylation

sites on FOXO3a: Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315 (34). Consistent
with our previous study (7), parthenolide increases Akt
phosphorylation in prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells
(Fig. 5A). Consequently, the phosphorylation on Ser253 in FOXO3a is increased by parthenolide in a dose-dependent manner.
Radiation only slightly increases Akt and FOXO3a phosphorylation. This may be explained by the fact that radiation only
induces transient activation of Akt, which peaks at 1 hour
after radiation and then drops at 6 hours after radiation (7).

Cancer Res; 70(7) April 1, 2010

In DU145 cells, the total FOXO3a level is increased after radiation treatment, consistent with Yang's observation in osteosarcoma cells (20). Parthenolide decreases total FOXO3a
level in DU145 cells, which may be due to Akt activation–
induced FOXO3a degradation by proteasome (35). Although
FOXO3a phosphorylation increases in prostate cancer cells, in
normal prostate epithelial PrEC cells, the combination of
parthenolide with radiation does not enhance but slightly
decreases FOXO3a phosphorylation.

Akt-mediated phosphorylation has been shown to induce

its DNA binding activity. This is confirmed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA; Fig. 5B). Radiation

Selective Radiosensitization by Redox Modulation

which is suppressed by parthenolide, consistent with the
EMSA result.
FOXO3a regulates a wide range of target genes. Because
radiation kills cells, in part through generation of ROS, we
detected FOXO3a targets—antioxidant enzymes catalase
and MnSOD—in prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells
(Fig. 5D). MnSOD protein level is increased after radiation
in both cell lines, but is suppressed by parthenolide.
Parthenolide also decreases catalase levels dose dependently in both cell lines. Consistent with FOXO3a DNA
binding activity, MnSOD and catalase levels in PrEC cells
are not changed by parthenolide.
Suppression of antioxidant enzymes by parthenolide contributes to its radiosensitization effect. To confirm the role
of antioxidant enzymes in the selective radiosensitization
effect of parthenolide, we treated PC3 cells with a SOD mimetic, MnTE-2-PyP5+. SOD mimetic partially abolishes the
radiosensitization effect of parthenolide in PC3 cells as determined by colony survival assay (Fig. 6A).
We then overexpressed FOXO3a in PC3 cells to investigate
whether overexpression of FOXO3a can rescue cells from
parthenolide-induced radiosensitization effect by induction
of antioxidant enzymes. Overexpression of FOXO3a-WT and
FOXO3a-TM decreases the survival of untreated cells, possibly due to the induction of apoptotic targets of FOXO3a (19).
We therefore normalized all untreated cell viability to 100% to
eliminate basal survival differences among three different
transfection groups. After normalization, we observed that
FOXO3a overexpression does not significantly affect cell sensitivity to radiation treatment. However, overexpression of
FOXO3a, especially constitutively active FOXO3a-TM, in
PC3 cells significantly confers cellular resistance to the effect
of parthenolide (Fig. 6B). The expression of exogenous HAFOXO3a was confirmed by Western blot. The basal levels of
the antioxidant enzymes catalase and MnSOD are higher
when active FOXO3a-TM is overexpressed (Fig. 6C). These data show that FOXO3a plays an important role in maintaining
the cellular antioxidant enzymes catalase and MnSOD, which
are involved in the radiosensitization effect of parthenolide.

Discussion
The selective cytotoxicity of parthenolide to cancer cells has
been reported in human acute myelogenous leukemia stem
and progenitor cells (36). Our current study confirms these
findings in prostate cancer cells and extends to show that
the radiosensitization effect of parthenolide is selective to
prostate cancer cells but not to normal prostate epithelial
PrEC cells (Fig. 1). Our results also indicate that parthenolide
“rejuvenates” irradiated normal prostate cells because cell
growth rate after radiation is restored to the untreated control
level when combined with parthenolide treatment. Parthenolide decreases radiation-induced ROS in PrEC cells (Fig. 2A),
which correlates with increased GSH levels (Fig. 3A). Thus,
the apparent antioxidant property of parthenolide in normal
prostate cells may be due, in part, to the increased GSH level
and may account for the rejuvenation of irradiated PrEC cells.

The selective targeting of cancer cells by parthenolide is of
great interest. Our study shows for the first time that differential modulation of intracellular redox state by parthenolide
in prostate cancer and normal prostate cells is involved in its
selective radiosensitization effect. Cancer cells and normal
cells have different redox status, which may be targeted for
selective cancer killing. Prostate cancer PC3 cells have higher
Nox1 and lower MnSOD, catalase (Supplementary Fig. S1),
and GSH levels (Fig. 3A) compared with normal prostate PrEC
cells, which may be responsible for the high oxidative stress
levels in prostate cancer cells. In response to the constitutively high oxidative stress in prostate cancer cells, elevated
proliferation and induction of adaptive response are observed; for example, higher thioredoxin levels in prostate
cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S2) and constitutively active
NF-κB (37), which may be involved in treatment resistance
(38–40). Parthenolide further increases oxidative stress in
prostate cancer cells by activating NADPH oxidase and suppressing the antioxidants thioredoxin, MnSOD, and catalase.
The redox imbalance in prostate cancer cells caused by
parthenolide enhances cellular sensitivity to oxidative
stress–inducing radiotherapy (Fig. 6D). However, in normal
prostate cells, due to high GSH (Fig. 3A) and glutathione Stransferase (GST; ref. 41) levels, parthenolide may more readily
conjugate with GSH under the catalysis of GSTs and then be
exported outside the cells, leading to cellular resistance to
parthenolide.
How parthenolide activates Nox remains unknown. Because
the amount of Nox1 is not increased (Fig. 4B) by parthenolide,
parthenolide may activate Nox by facilitating the assembly of
the multisubunit enzyme complex. The full activation of Nox1
requires p22phox, Noxo1, Noxa1, and Rac1 (9). It has been
shown that modulation of cysteine thiol can activate Ras (42,
43). Because Rac1 is a member of the Ras superfamily of
GTPases, it is possible that parthenolide may modify the cysteine thiol on Rac1 and increase its activity. In addition to direct oxidative damage, Nox-derived ROS plays an important
role in redox signaling due to its highly regulated activation.
Activation of Nox can activate PI3K/Akt by the oxidation
and inactivation of phosphatases that dephosphorylate PI3K
or AKT kinase by Nox-derived ROS. The PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a
cascade leads to downregulation of the antioxidant enzymes
MnSOD and catalase, which is also involved in the oxidative
stress induced by parthenolide.
In summary, our study shows that in prostate cancer cells,
parthenolide induces dramatic oxidative stress through
NADPH oxidase activation. On one hand, NADPH oxidase activation not only increases ROS generation but also decreases
reduced thioredoxin or acts as a second messenger to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to a decrease in antioxidant defense capacity through FOXO3a suppression. On
the other hand, parthenolide increases GSH levels but does
not activate NADPH oxidase in normal prostate epithelial
cells. Thus, the selective induction of oxidative stress by
parthenolide in prostate cancer cells accounts for its selective radiosensitization effect. Our results also imply that
modulating the intracellular redox state might be an ideal
way for cancer therapy to achieve selective cancer killing.
