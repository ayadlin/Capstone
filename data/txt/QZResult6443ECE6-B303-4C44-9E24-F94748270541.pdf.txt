ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play major roles in cancer initiation, progression,
and metastasis. It is evident from growing reports that PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Sonic
Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathways are aberrantly reactivated in pancreatic CSCs.
Here, we examined the efficacy of combining NVP-LDE-225 (PI3K/mTOR inhibitor)
and NVP-BEZ-235 (Smoothened inhibitor) on pancreatic CSCs characteristics,
microRNA regulatory network, and tumor growth. NVP-LDE-225 co-operated with
NVP-BEZ-235 in inhibiting pancreatic CSC’s characteristics and tumor growth in
mice by acting at the level of Gli. Combination of NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235
inhibited self-renewal capacity of CSCs by suppressing the expression of pluripotency
maintaining factors Nanog, Oct-4, Sox-2 and c-Myc, and transcription of Gli.
NVP-LDE-225 co-operated with NVP-BEZ-235 to inhibit Lin28/Let7a/Kras axis in
pancreatic CSCs. Furthermore, a superior interaction of these drugs was observed on
spheroid formation by pancreatic CSCs isolated from Pankras/p53 mice. The combination
of these drugs also showed superior effects on the expression of proteins involved
in cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis. In addition, NVP-LDE-225 co-operated
with NVP-BEZ-235 in inhibiting EMT through modulation of cadherin, vimentin and
transcription factors Snail, Slug and Zeb1. In conclusion, these data suggest that the
combined inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Shh pathways may be beneficial for the
treatment of pancreatic cancer.

treatment options for pancreatic cancer, therefore there is
an urgent need to develop novel and more efficient drugs.
Currently, there are very limited therapeutic options for
pancreatic cancer, therefore new drugs and novel treatment
approaches are urgently needed.
Despite the initial effectiveness of conventional
therapies against cancer, metastases recurrence and
emergence are major causes of therapeutic failure in cancer
patients. These therapies mainly target the differentiated

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer has very poor prognosis due to
its late diagnosis, silent nature, low surgical resectability
rates, and resistance to standard chemotherapy and
radiation [1]. Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignancy
with a 5-year survival rate less than 6% and is ranked
as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in
the United States [2]. Currently, there are very limited

and proliferative cells that comprise the bulk of the tumor.
The relapse of cancer is attributed to a small population
of cancer stem cells (CSC) residing within the tumor.
In addition to resistance to typical therapies, CSCs are
reported to have inherently high tumor-initiating potential,
which is implicated in tumor relapse, driving primary
tumor growth as well as establishment of metastases by
CSCs [3, 4].
Hedgehog (Hh) is an intercellular signaling
molecule (polypeptide) that was discovered in
drosophila [5]. Hh signaling pathway plays a crucial
role in embryonic development from invertebrates
to mammals [6, 7]. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is one of
the members of the Hh family [8], and studies have
demonstrated that abnormal activation of the Shh
pathway due to genomic alterations leads to an increase
in cell survival and metastasis in cancer cells [9, 10]. In
fact, higher Hh levels along with enhanced expression of
Hh pathway target genes has been identified in different
cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer,
upper gastrointestinal cancer, and prostate cancer [10].
Shh ligands bind to its receptor Patched (Patch) and
causes internalization Patch, which in its active form
inhibits Smoothened (Smo). Smo positively regulates
the activation of Glioma-associated (Gli) family of
zinc finger transcription factors, which ultimately
translocate to nucleus to induce gene transcription [11,
12]. Expression levels of Gli have been interrelated
with the expression levels of the Shh pathway all
together, suggesting Gli transcriptional activity
is a direct indicator of Shh pathway activity [13].
Oncogenic activating mutations in the components of
the Hh signaling pathway have been reported in several
cancer [14–16]. In contrast, inactivating mutations
have been found in Patch1 associated with GorlinGoltz Syndrome. Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome patients
develop basal cell carcinomas and have higher risk of
developing rhabdomyosarcoma and medulloblastoma
[17]. In agreement with the role of Hh signaling in tumor
development, a variety of drugs have been developed
in the recent years to block this signaling pathway
in cancer cells including Hh antagonist SANTs1–4,
Gli inhibitor GANT-61, and smoothened inhibitor NVPLDE-225 [18–20].
The Phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian
target of rapamycin (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) pathway
plays an important role in various cellular processes,
including growth regulation, and apoptosis [21]. This
pathway is a commonly hyper activated in cancer
and promotes cell survival, proliferation and cancer
progression [22]. mTOR is an important target of Akt
and exist in two distinct functional complexes, mTOR
complex I and mTOR complex II [23]. mTOR-Complex
I regulates the expression of ribosomal protein S6
kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E-binding-protein-1 (4E-BP1),which in turn regulate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the expression of Bad, cyclin D1, and Bcl-2 [23, 24].
Inhibition of mTOR alone results in cancer relapse due to
up-regulation of PI3K activity. Therefore dual inhibitors
of PI3K and mTOR may be beneficial for a long-term
treatment to inhibit cell growth. NVP-BEZ-235 is a
dual inhibitor of PI3K as well as mTOR complex I and
complex II and it has shown anti-proliferative effects in
various cancers [25, 26]. NVP-BEZ-235 has been shown
to radiosensitize prostate cancer cells under normoxic and
hypoxic conditions [27]. It is currently being tested in
phase I/II clinical trials in cancer patients [28].
miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs and have been
shown to regulate gene expression [29, 30]. It has been
shown that let-7 family of miRNAs plays an important role
in cell differentiation, development and tumor suppression
[31]. Lin28 is a developmentally regulated RNA binding
protein which regulates the biogenesis of let-7 micro-RNA
family [32, 33]. Lin28 acts as an oncogene and promotes
carcinogenesis [34–37]. The Lin28/Let-7 pathway
affects many cellular processes including the regulation
of CSCs, differentiation and glycolytic metabolism [34,
38–41]. Furthermore, Lin28/let7 axis may be exploited
to overcome the radioresistance of human cancers having
activated K-Ras signaling [42]. Overexpression of LIN28
correlates with poor outcome [43, 44], therefore drugs
that impact the Lin28/Let-7 pathway could be beneficial
in treating cancer patients.
The CSCs demonstrate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) program that has well-established
roles in promoting an invasive and metastatic cancer
[45, 46]. In the process of EMT, cancerous cells lose
contact with surrounding cells, undergo major changes
in their cytoskeleton, and acquire a mesenchymal-like
structure which assist them with increased invasive and
migratory abilities [47, 48]. The process of EMT occurs
through downregulation of the epithelial adhesion
protein E-cadherin (CDH1), which is repressed by the
transcriptional regulators Zeb1, Zeb2, Twist1, Snail
and Slug, which also regulate various other epithelialrelated genes [49–52]. Many signaling pathways regulate
the process of EMT including the Shh pathway [53].
The purpose of this study was to examine the
interactive effects of NVP-LDE- 225 and NVP-BEZ-235
on characteristics of pancreatic CSCs in culture and
inhibition of tumor growth in NOD/SCID IL2Rγ null
mice. Data obtained from this study demonstrate that
the combination of NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235
was superior than single agent alone in inhibiting the
self-renewal of pancreatic CSCs by suppressing the
expression of pluripotency-maintaining factors (Nanog,
Oct-4, Sox- 2 and c-Myc) and transcription of Gli.
These drugs also co-operated in inhibiting EMT by
suppressing transcription factors Snail, Slug and Zeb1.
The combination of these drugs was also superior in
inhibiting the pancreatic CSC tumor growth in NOD/
SCID IL2Rγ null mice than single agent alone. These data

treatment of pancreatic cancer by targeting CSCs.

pathched2 and smoothened (SMO) was decreased and
the expression of SuFu was increased by treating with
different concentrations of NVP-LDE-225. These protein
profiles clearly show that NVP-BEZ-235 inhibits PI3/
mTOR/Akt pathway, and NVP-LDE-225 inhibits Shh
pathway in pancreatic CSCs.

RESULTS
NVP-BEZ-235 inhibits the PI3/mTOR/
Akt pathway, and NVP-LDE-225 inhibits
the components of the Shh pathway in
pancreatic CSCs

NVP-LDE-225 cooperates with NVP-BEZ-235
in inhibiting cell viability and colony and
spheroid formation, and in inducing apoptosis in
pancreatic CSCs

PI3/mTOR/Akt pathway plays a significant role in
pancreatic carcinogenesis [62, 63]. We therefore examined
the effects of NVP-BEZ-235 on cell viability in spheroids
formed by CD44+CD24+ESA+ CSCs (Fig. 1A). Primary
spheroids were grown in suspension for one week,
whereas for secondary spheroids, CSCs from primary
spheroids were reseeded, treated and grown for another
week. NVP-BEZ-235 inhibited cell viability in primary
and secondary spheroids in a dose-dependent manner.
Similarly, NVP-BEZ-235 inhibited colony formation of
pancreatic CSCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B).
We first examined the effect of NVP-BEZ-235 on
the components of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in pancreatic
CSCs (Fig. 1C). Pancreatic CSCs treated with different
concentrations of NVP-BEZ-235 showed decrease in the
levels of phospho-PI3K, phospho-Akt, phospho-p70S6K,
phospho-GSK3Kβ, and phospho-4EBP1; whereas the
expression of total p70S6K was not altered in drug treated
samples as compare to untreated control of pancreatic
CSCs. Surprisingly, we have seen a slight decline in the
expression of total Akt, total GSK3Kβ, and total 4EBP1
levels at higher doses of treatment with NVP-BEZ-235,
which may be due to degradation of proteins during
apoptosis.
Shh pathway is constitutively active in pancreatic
cancer and plays a significant role in CSC’s survival [64].
We therefore examined the effects of NVP-LDE-225 on cell
viability in spheroids formed by pancreatic CSCs (Fig. 1D).
NVP-LDE-225 inhibited cell viability in primary and
secondary spheroids in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly,
NVP-LDE-225 inhibited colony formation of pancreatic
CSCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E).
We next examined the effects of NVP-LDE-225
on Gli reporter activity by luciferase assay, and Gl1
and Gl2 expression by q-RT-PCR (Fig. 1F and 1G).
NVP-LDE-225 inhibited Gli reporter activity. Gli is
a transcriptional target of its own, because Gli1 and
2 contain Gli binding sites. NVP-LDE-225 inhibited the
expression of Gli1 and Gli2 as measured by q-RT-PCR.
We next examined the effect of NVP-LDE-225 on the
components of Shh pathway by measuring the expression
of Gli1, Gli2, patched 1, patched 2, Smo and Sufu by
Western blot analysis. Pancreatic CSCs were treated
with NVP-LDE-225 (0–2  μM) for 48 hrs. As shown
in Fig.  1H, the expression of Gli1, Gli2, pathched1,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We first examined the interactive effects of
NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235 on viability of
pancreatic CSCs by XTT assay. As shown in Fig. 2A,
NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235 alone inhibited cell
viability in a dose-dependent manner. The NVP-LDE-225
cooperated with NVP-BEZ-235 in inhibiting viability of
pancreatic CSCs. The combination of NVP-LDE-225 and
NVP-BEZ-235 was superior than single agent alone.
In order to check the synergetic effect
of NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235 on the
induction of apoptosis in pancreatic CSCs, we treated the
cells with these drugs alone and with their combination
for 48 h, and analyzed apoptosis by PI staining assay
(Sub G0 cells) using flow cytometry. NVP-LDE-225 and
NVP-BEZ-235 alone induced apoptosis in pancreatic
CSCs (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, NVP-LDE-225 cooperated
with NVP-BEZ-235 in inducing apoptosis in pancreatic
CSCs. Quantitative analysis of apoptotic cells clearly
demonstrates that the combination of NVP-LDE-225 and
NVP-BEZ-235 was superior than single agent alone in
inducing apoptosis in pancreatic CSCs (Fig. 2C). Further,
the combination of NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235
was superior than single agent alone in inducing cleavage
of caspase3 into its active form (Fig. 2D). Poly-ADP
ribose polymerase (PARP) is a substrate of caspase
3 therefore; we next analyzed the cleavage of PARP by
Western blot analysis. These drugs showed co-operative
effects on cleavage of PARP as well. We next examined
the interactive effects of NVP-LDE225 and NVP-BEZ235
on colony formation of pancreatic CSCs. NVP-LDE225
and NVP-BEZ235 alone inhibited colony formation
of pancreatic CSCs (Fig. 2E and 2F), but when used in
combination these drugs inhibited colony formation to
a higher extent. These data demonstrate the synergetic
anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of NVP-LDE225
and NVP-BEZ235 on pancreatic CSCs.
Spheroid formation in suspension is one
of the characteristics of CSCs. We therefore
examined the interactive effects of NVP-LDE225 and
NVP-BEZ235 on spheroid formation of pancreatic CSCs.
NVP-LDE225 and NVP-BEZ235 alone inhibited spheroid
formation of pancreatic CSCs (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, the
combination of NVP-LDE225 and NVP-BEZ235 was
more effective in inhibiting spheroid formation than single

NVP-BEZ-235 alone inhibited the expression of Bcl-2,
Bcl-XL, cIAP1, cIAP2, and cyclin D1 in pancreatic CSCs.
NVP-LDE-225 and/or NVP-BEZ-235 upregulated the
expression of Bim in pancreatic CSCs. Furthermore,
the combination of NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235
was superior than single agent alone in inhibiting the

for modulation of genes which regulate cell proliferation,

apoptosis-related genes by NVP-LDE-225 and/or

the effects of NVP-LDE-225 and/or NVP-BEZ-235 on
the expression of Bcl-2, XIAP, BMI1 and CCND1 by
qRT-PCR (Fig. 2H). NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235

cooperated with NVP-BEZ-235 in inhibiting the
expression of these genes.

BEZ235 and LDE225 on Gli reporter activity in pancreatic
CSCs (Fig. 2J). The combination of BEZ235 and LDE225
was superior than single agent alone in inhibiting Gli reporter
activity. The expressions of Gli, Patched 1 and Patched 2 are
transcriptionally regulated by Gli. We therefore examined
the effects of NVP-LDE-225 and/or NVP-BEZ-235 on
the expression of Gli1, Gli2, Patched1 and Patched2 in
pancreatic CSCs. NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235

pancreatic cancer development in humans [60]. We have
recently reported that pancreatic CSCs isolated from
KrasG12D mice are phenotypically similar and also respond to
anticancer drugs as pancreatic CSCs isolated from humans
[54, 57, 58, 69–72]. Since CSCs play a major role in cancer
initiation, progression, metastasis and drug resistance, they
can be used to assess the response of anticancer drugs. We
next examined the effects of NVP-LDE-225, NVP-BEZ-235

Nanog, Oct-4, c-Myc and Sox-2 at transcriptional level
in pancreatic CSCs; further, even higher inhibition was
observed in the expression of these factors in samples treated

We further validated the data obtained from qRTPCR by the Western blot analysis, where NVP-LDE-225
co-operated with NVP-BEZ-235 in inhibiting the
expression of Nanog, Oct-4, c-Myc and Sox-2 in pancreatic

drugs inhibited the expression of Nanog, Oct-4, c-Myc and
Sox-2 in pancreatic CSC spheroids. These data suggest that
inhibition of the Shh pathway and PI3/Akt/mTOR pathways
can suppress the self-renewal capacity of pancreatic
CSCs by inhibiting the factors required for maintaining
pluripotency of pancreatic CSCs.

NVP-LDE-225, NVP-BEZ-235 and their combination on
EMT of pancreatic CSCs (Fig. 4). These drugs inhibited
cell motility and migration of pancreatic CSCs, and their
combination showed superior effects in suppressing
CSC’s motility and migration (Fig. 4A and 4B). We also
analyzed the expression of transcription factors involved
in the process of EMT (Fig. 4C–4E). NVP-LDE-225 and
NVP-BEZ-235 alone inhibited the expression of Snail,

hereditary disorder, cancer gastrointestinal disorder,
developmental disorder, metabolic disorder, cellular
growth and proliferation, cellular development, cell death
and survival, inflammatory disease, tumor morphology,
cell cycle, connective tissue disorders, cellular movement,

NVP-LDE-225 (NVP-LDE-225 vs control) induced
the expression of 5 miRNAs and inhibited the expression
of 16 miRNAs in Pancreatic CSCs (Fig. 5D). Based on
bio-function analysis, NVP-LDE-225 regulated those
miRNAs which control cancer, gastrointestinal disease,

The combination of NVP-BEZ-235 and

inhibited the expression of 4 miRNAs in Pancreatic
CSCs (Fig. 5G). Heat map demonstrated the differential
expression of miRNA expression in NVP-LDE-225 and/

together modulated those miRNAs which regulate
cancer, gastrointestinal disease, inflammatory disease,

BEZ235 and LDE225 regulate Lin28/Let7a/Kras
axis in pancreatic CSCs
Lin28/Let-7 pathway regulates several biological
processes, such as differentiation of stem cell, invasion
and metastasis, aerobic glycolysis, and tumorigenesis
[34, 38–40, 42–44]. We therefore examined whether
treatment of CSCs with NVP-BEZ-235 and/or
NVP-LDE-225 regulate the expression of Lin28, let7 and
Kras. NVP-BEZ-235 and NVP-LDE-225 alone inhibited
the expression of Lin28a and Kras, and induced the
expression of Let7a (Fig. 6A–6C). The combination of
NVP-BEZ-235 and NVP-LDE-225 was more effective in
inhibiting the expression of Lin28a and Kras, and inducing
the expression of Let7a. These data suggest that targeting
of Lin28/Let7/Kras axis by NVP-BEZ-235 and NVPLDE-225 may be a useful strategy for the treatment of
pancreatic cancer.

The combination of NVP-LDE-225 and NVPBEZ-235 was superior than single agent alone
in inhibiting pancreatic CSC tumor growth in
NOD/SCID IL2Rγ null mice
Since NVP-LDE-225 and/or NVP-BEZ-235
inhibited cell viability, spheroid and colony formation,
and induced apoptosis in pancreatic CSCs, we next sought
to examine their effects on pancreatic CSC xenografted
tumor growth in NOD/SCID IL2Rγ null mouse model.
Pancreatic CSCs were injected subcutaneously into NOD/
SCID IL2Rγ null mice. After tumor formation, mice
were treated with saline, NVP-LDE-225 (40 mg/kg),
NVP-BEZ-235 (20 mg/kg) or combination of both drugs
intraperitoneally 5 days/week for 4 weeks. NVP-LDE-225,
and NVP-BEZ-235 alone inhibited tumor growth (as
judged by tumor weight), and their combination had
superior effects on tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 7A).
Mice weight were also checked during the course of the
study, which remained normal and therefore these drugs
alone or in combination had no adverse effect on the
health of the mice (data not shown).
Since NVP-LDE-225 and/or NVP-BEZ-235
inhibited pancreatic CSC’s tumor growth in mice, we next
sought to examine the molecular mechanisms of action of
these drugs. We first measured the expression of proteins
involved in maintaining pluripotency of pancreatic
CSCs by the Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7B,
NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235 alone inhibited the
expression of c-Myc, Sox-2, Nanog and Oct-4 in tumor
samples. However, the combination of these drugs was
more effective in inhibiting the expression of these
proteins than single agent alone.

Furthermore, the E-cadherin expression was even
higher in tumor samples derived from mice treated with
the combination of NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235
(Fig. 7E). Conversely, the expression of Vimentin was
found to be lower in tumor samples derived from NVPLDE-225 or NVP-BEZ-235 treated mice, and even
lesser in tumors where combination of these drugs was
used. Since NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235 were
effective in regulating the expression of E-cadherin
and Vimentin. We also measured the expression of
EMT-related transcription factors Snail, and Slug. As
analyzed by the Western blot analysis, the expression
of both of these transcription factors was decreased
in the tumor tissue derived from NVP-LDE-225 and/
or NVP-BEZ-235 treated mice. These data from mice
tumor tissue indicate that both NVP-LDE-225 and NVPBEZ-235 can lower the potential of early metastasis
events, and combination of both drugs can lower this
process to even higher extant.

Further, we also analyzed the expression of Bcl-2
protein family in tumor samples by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 7C). The expression of Bcl-2 was reduced whereas
the expression of Bad, Bax, and Bak was found to
be higher in tumor samples treated with these drugs.
The amount of cleaved caspase 3, and cleaved caspase9
were also found to increase in tumor samples treated with
NVP-LDE-225 and/or NVP-BEZ-235 (Fig. 7D). These
data suggest that NVP-LDE-225 and/or NVP-BEZ-235
inhibited CSC’s tumor growth by modulating Bcl-2 family
members and activating caspases.
The process of metastasis initiation requires
invasion, which is enabled by EMT. Carcinoma cells
in primary tumor lose cell-cell adhesion mediated
by E-cadherin repression and break through the
basement membrane, and enter in bloodstream through
intravasation. Therefore, we examined the expression of
EMT-related proteins by measuring the expression of
E-cadherin, Vimentin, Slug and Snail. The expression
of E-cadherin was higher in tumor samples derived

DISCUSSION

The PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to regulating
a variety of extracellular signals and plays an important
role in tumor survival and cell proliferation and inhibition
of apoptosis [21]. Akt is shown to be active in human
pancreatic cancer tissues and Akt inhibitors such as
ZSTK474 inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth [73, 74].
NVP-BEZ-235 has been shown to inhibit both PI3K/Akt
and mTOR signaling and inhibits tumor growth in various
cancers [25, 26] and is undergoing in phase I/II clinical
trials for use in solid tumors [28]. The PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway is involved in providing stimulation for
cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis and it is has
been assessed that this pathway is dysregulated in at
least 50% of all cancer types. Our data from this study
clearly show that NVP-BEZ-235 specifically inhibits the
components of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by reducing
the expression of phospho-Akt, phospho-mTOR, and
phospho-p70S6 kinase.
The Shh pathway has many roles in developmental
processes; regulates tissue homeostasis, and maintains
stem cell populations. But in addition to its role in normal

Tumors arise from a small population of cancer
cells (usually less than 5% of cells of a tumor) that have
properties of adult stem cells, particularly the ability
to self-renew and multilineage differentiation. These
properties bring CSCs at the apex of tumor biology
architecture. The CSCs are quite resistant to standard
chemotherapy and ionizing radiation therapy, and play
a major role in relapse of cancer. Therefore, there is an
urgent need to develop new chemotherapeutic drugs
or develop unique combination of existing drugs to
achieve the inhibition on characteristics of CSCs. In the
present study, we have demonstrated for the first time
that combination of NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235
inhibits pancreatic CSCs characteristics and xenografted
tumor growth in NOD/SCID mice. Combination of these
drugs has synergetic effect in the induction of apoptosis
through caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of PARP.
Inhibition of Shh and PI3K/AKT pathways together may
be a novel strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

developmental processes, the Shh pathway dysregulation
has been shown to cause and sustain cancer growth [75].
Excessive amount of Shh ligand has been detected in many
tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract [76] and Shh has
been shown to be a critical mediator in the initiation of
pancreatic cancer, its progression, and metastasis [65].
Recently, we have revealed that various components of
Shh pathway are highly expressed in human pancreatic
cancer cell lines and pancreatic CSCs and anticancer
agents inhibited pancreatic CSC characteristics and
xenografted tumor growth in mice [57, 71]. In this study,
we verified that pancreatic CSCs consistently express
various components of the Shh signaling pathway,
including Gli1, Gli2, Patched-1 and Patched-2, suggesting
that the Shh pathway is one of the ‘core’ signaling
pathways in pancreatic CSCs.
In the present study, our data shows that NVPLDE-225/NVP-BEZ-235 alone or in combination inhibited
pro-survival proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and pro-apoptotic
proteins, Bak and Bax, in pancreatic CSCs. Bcl-2 family
proteins, which have either pro- or anti-apoptotic

activities, and regulate apoptosis, tumorigenesis and
cellular responses to anti-cancer therapy. XIAPs inhibit
apoptosis that is induced by overproduction of caspases,
and XIAP binds to caspase 3, 7 and 9 and inhibits their
activity [77]. Combination of NVP-LDE-225 and
NVP-BEZ-235 inhibited the expression of XIAP, survivin,
cIAP1 and cIAP2.
Panras/p53 mice have concomitant endogenous
expression of transgenic mutant KrasG12D and p53R172
in the pancreas. These mice (about 100%) develop
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas with metastasis in
the liver, lung, and adrenals [61]. Pankras/p53 mice mimic
pancreatic cancer development in humans with similar
genetic and morphological alterations. NVP-LDE-225
and NVP-BEZ-235, alone or in combination, inhibited
spheroid formation by pancreatic CSCs isolated from
Pankras/p53 mice, suggesting the inhibition of these PI3K/
Akt/mTOR and Shh pathways can be exploited in
pancreatic cancer harboring mutations in Kras and p53.

existence of a feedback loop involving NF-κB, Lin28/
Let-7 and TNF-α in transformed cells [79, 80]. These
studies suggest that Lin28/Let-7/Kras pathway may be
exploited to control pancreatic CSC characteristics and
tumor growth.
Metastatic growth requires the dissemination of
cancerous cells from the primary tumor, followed by
their reestablishment in a secondary site. The EMT is
critical for development of many tissues and organs
in the developing embryo, and numerous embryonic
events, carcinogenesis and metastasis. Signals within
tumor microenvironment trigger cancer cells to acquire
an invasive phenotype through EMT. Similar to cells that
undergo EMT during normal development, carcinoma
cells switch from a sessile, epithelial phenotype to
a motile by losing cell-cell contacts, changes in the
cytoskeleton, and acquire a mesenchymal-like phenotype
endowing them with increased invasive and migratory
abilities [47, 81]. Increasing evidence suggests that
EMT plays an important role during malignant tumor
progression. Various key molecules present in the tumor
microenvironment serve as cytosolic bridges between

and metastasis, aerobic glycolysis, and tumorigenesis
[34, 38–40, 42–44]. The tumor-suppressor let-7 miRNA
family has been shown to be universally down-regulated
in CSCs, because of abundant expression of the regulatory
gene Lin28. Low let-7 levels resulted in up-regulation
of oncogenes including MYCN, AURKB and Lin28
itself, the latter through a direct feedback mechanism.
Let-7 is required for normal gene expression in the
context of embryonic development and oncogenesis.
Lin28B/Let7 regulates key CSC properties by modulating
the expression of Oct-4 / Sox-2 and determines the
efficiency by which normal human oral keratinocytes
could be reprogrammed to iPSC [38]. The overexpression
of let-7a or inhibition of Lin28 suppressed expression of
K-Ras, and radiosensitized cancer cells [42]. We have
demonstrated that the Lin28/Let-7/Kras axis is regulated
by NVP-LDE-225 and NVP-BEZ-235 in pancreatic
CSCs. Let-7 may inhibit Kras, whereas Lin28 protein
could control the PI3k/AKT pathway [41]. Lin28 has
been implicated in the repression of Let-7 and mediates
both glucose metabolism and embryonic stem cell
differentiation [41, 78]. A recent study has reported the

and NVP-BEZ-235 inhibited the self-renewal capacity of
pancreatic CSCs isolated from human and Pankras/p53 mice
in vitro, and CSC’s tumor growth in NOD/SCID IL2Rϒ

drugs were used in combination. EMT inhibition was
associated with suppression of transcription factors Zeb1,
Snail and Slug, and mesenchymal marker vimentin, and
upregulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin in pancreatic
CSCs. In summary, our findings suggest that combined
inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Shh pathways will
be beneficial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer by
targeting CSCs, and further study of these pathway
inhibition in the clinical setting is warranted.

Where Yij represents the jth observation on the ith treatment
group, μ is the common effect for the whole experiment and
εij represents the random error present in the jth observation
on the ith category . The Fisher’s Least Significant Difference
(FSD) test was used to compare the group means of NVPBEZ-235, NVP-LDE-225 and the combined NVP-BEZ-235
and NVP-LDE-225, to the Control group. All samples were
analyzed in biological duplicates.

NVP-LDE-225, NVP-BEZ-235 and their combination
were added in the media. After 48 h of incubation, cells
were trypsinized, washed with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl
PBS with 10 μl RNAase (10 mg/ml) and incubated at 37ºC
for 30 min. At the end of incubation, 50 μl PI solution was
added and cells were analyzed for apoptosis using a flow
cytometry (Accuri C6 flow cytometer, BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA).

Motility assay
Cell motility assay was performed as described
elsewhere [55, 57]. In brief, pancreatic CSCs were grown
in monolayer and then a scratch was made with a pipette
tip. After washing twice with PBS, CSCs were treated
with or without NVP-LDE-225 and/or NVP-BEZ-235.
Pancreatic CSCs migrate into the scratch area as single
cells from the confluent sides. The width of the scratch gap
was viewed under the microscope in four separate areas.
Three replicate wells from a six-well plate were used for
each experimental condition.

Functional analysis
Biological functional and network analysis of the
miRNAs was carried out using the Ingenuity Pathways
Analysis software (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, version 7.6
(http://www.ingenuity.com)).

Transwell migration assay

Generation of KrasG12D; Trp53LSL-R172H/+ PDAC mice

Cell migration assay was performed as described
elsewhere [55, 57].

Pdx1-Cre mice (generated by Dr. Lowy, University
of Cincinnati) were purchased from the Jackson laboratory
(Bar Harbor, Maine). LSL-Trp53R172H and LSLKrasG12D/+ mice were obtained from MMHCC, NCI/
NIH. All of these genetically engineered mice were bred
and genotyped for the presence of Kras, p53, and Cre
[54, 60, 61]. Six-week-old breeding pairs of genetically
engineered mice, including transgenic Pdx1-Cre, LSLTrp53
R172H, and LSL-KrasG12D mice were used for breeding.
To produce compound transgenic Pankras/p53 mice, the double
transgenic LSLKrasG12D/+-LSL-Trp53R172/+ mice were first
generated, and then further mated with heterozygous Pdx1Cre transgenic mice [61]. Pancreatic CSCs were isolated
from the Pankras/p53 mice as we described elsewhere [54].

Tumor spheroid assay and
Immunocytochemistry
Tumor spheroid assay was performed as described
elsewhere [55, 57]. In brief, pancreatic CSCs were grown
in six-well ultralow attachment plates (Corning Inc.)
at a density of 1000 cells/ml in well-defined pancreatic
CSC medium at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere of 95%
air and 5% CO2. NVP-LDE-225 (5 μM), NVP-BEZ-235
(1 μM) or their combination was added to each well.
Similarly, for secondary spheroids, CSCs from spheroids
were reseeded and treated with drugs for another 7 days.
For tertiary spheroids, CSCs from spheroids were
reseeded and treated with drugs for another 7 days.
Immunocytochemistry of pancreatic CSCs was performed
as we described elsewhere [58].

Antitumor activity of NVP-LDE-225 and/
or NVP-BEZ-235 on pancreatic CSC’s tumor
xenograft in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ null mice

RNA isolation and mRNA expression analysis by
qRT-PCR

NOD/SCID/IL2Rϒ null mice were used in this
study because these mice are better predictor for the
biological response to therapy. Human pancreatic CSCs
(1 × 106 cells mixed with Matrigel, Becton Dickinson,
Bedford, MA, in 75 μl total volume, 50:50 ratio) were
injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 4–6 weeks old
NOD/SCID IL2Rγ null mice. After tumor formation,
mice were treated with NVP-LDE-225 (40 mg/kg
body weight), and/or NVP-BEZ-235 (20 mg/kg body
weight), by intraperitoneal injections, 5 times per
week for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, mice
were euthanized, tumors were isolated, measurements

RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis were
performed as described elsewhere [55, 57].

MicroRNA array analysis
The expression levels of expressed miRNAs were
measured using Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 arrays.
Only probe sets of human small-RNAs in the array were
used for the analysis. They constituted 1,733 human
mature miRNAs, 2,216 human snoRNAs and scaRNAs

Western blot analysis
Pancreatic CSCs treated with NVP-LDE-225 and/
or NVP-BEZ-235, and homogenized tumor samples were
lysed with RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail. Crude protein was resolved on SDSPAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). After
protein transfer, the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.2% Tween 20 in 1x TBS (TBST) for 1 h at
room temperature. The membrane was incubated with the
primary antibody (1:1000) at 4°C overnight with gentle
shaking and washed 3 times with TBST for 15 minutes
each. The membrane was incubated with secondary
antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then washed
3 times for 15 minutes. The blot was developed with by
the addition of ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockford, IL).
