Abstract
Identifying heritable genetic variants responsible for chemotherapeutic toxicities has been challenging due in part to
its multigenic nature. To date, there is a paucity of data on
genetic variants associated with patients experiencing severe
myelosuppression or cardiac toxicity following treatment with
daunorubicin. We present a genome-wide model using
International HapMap cell lines that integrate genotype and
gene expression to identify genetic variants that contribute to
daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. A cell growth inhibition
assay was used to measure variations in the cytotoxicity of
daunorubicin. Gene expression was determined using the
Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0ST Array. Using sequential analysis, we evaluated the associations between genotype
and cytotoxicity, those significant genotypes with gene
expression and correlated gene expression of the identified
candidates with cytotoxicity. A total of 26, 9, and 18 genetic
variants were identified to contribute to daunorubicininduced cytotoxicity through their effect on 16, 9, and 36
gene expressions in the combined, Centre d’ Etude du
Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH), and Yoruban populations,
respectively. Using 50 non-HapMap CEPH cell lines, single
nucleotide polymorphisms generated through our model
predicted 29% of the overall variation in daunorubicin
sensitivity and the expression of CYP1B1 was significantly
correlated with sensitivity to daunorubicin. In the CEPH
validation set, rs120525235 and rs3750518 were significant
predictors of transformed daunorubicin IC50 (P = 0.005 and
P = 0.0008, respectively), and rs1551315 trends toward
significance (P = 0.089). This unbiased method can be used
to elucidate genetic variants contributing to a wide range of
cellular phenotypes. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3161–8]

Introduction
Daunorubicin, an anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent, is
commonly used to treat leukemia, lymphoma, and advanced
HIV-associated Kaposi’s sarcoma (1, 2). The drug acts through DNA
and RNA synthesis inhibition by intercalating with DNA base pairs,
stabilizing the double-stranded DNA cleavage normally catalyzed
by topoisomerase II and causing inhibition of religation of DNA
breaks (3, 4). Daunorubicin also produces free radicals which have

been established as a cause of toxicity (5, 6). Despite its wide usage,
daunorubicin is associated with severe myelosuppression and can
cause cardiac toxicity (7–9). The incidence of daunorubicin
treatment–induced toxicities are highly variable and are associated
with both treatment dosage and patient age (10).
Our laboratory has used EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell
lines (LCL) derived from healthy individuals within 24 large Centre
d’ Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) pedigrees to show that
f29% of human variation in susceptibility to daunorubicininduced cytotoxicity is due to a genetic component (11). Thus,
genetics is likely to play a role in overall human variation in
daunorubicin-induced response and toxicity; however, only a few
clinical studies have evaluated the predictive value of genetic
variants. Wojnowski et al. have found significant association
between anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and genetic polymorphisms of the NAD(P)H oxidase and efflux transporters (MRP1
and MRP2) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with non–
Hodgkins lymphoma (6). In patients with either myeloma or acute
myelogenous leukemia who were treated with combination
chemotherapy that included daunorubicin, genetic polymorphisms
in GSTP1 and GSTT1 genes have been shown to associate with
clinical outcomes (e.g., progression-free survival or overall survival;
refs. 12, 13). Furthermore, it has been shown that African American
patients who received doxorubicin, a structural analogue of
daunorubicin, developed cardiotoxicity more frequently, indicative
of population-specific effects (14). There is a need to comprehensively elucidate the genetic variants important in daunorubicininduced cytotoxicity within and among populations.
Recently, our group developed a comprehensive, genome-wide
approach that integrates genotype, gene expression, and cytotoxicity
data to identify potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity
through their effect on expression (15, 16). The International
HapMap cell lines derived from individuals of African and European
descent allowed us to define a set of genetic variants unique to those
populations and common among both populations. Although we
recognize that there are limitations with the use of cell lines, these
studies will likely help direct further clinical studies by providing a
strong list of SNPs/candidate genes to evaluate in clinical trials. The
long-term goal is to identify genetic polymorphisms that influence
chemotherapeutic-induced toxicity in individuals and to identify
patients ‘‘at risk’’ for adverse events associated with this agent.

publication (17). Daunorubicin (NSC-82151) was kindly provided by the
Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment,
National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD).
Genotype and cytotoxicity association analysis. Cell growth inhibition
was tested in 175 LCLs as described previously (17). SNP genotypes were
downloaded from the International HapMap database5 (release 21) and
filtered. Details for the SNP filtration criteria can be found in our previous
publication (16). A total of 387,417 SNPs having a high minor allele
frequency and located in or near genes were included in the analysis.
Using Microsoft Excel software, an inverse normalization of the
percentile rank function was applied to the 175 combined IC50 values and
86 CEU or 89 YRI separate IC50 values for different testing populations,
respectively. The quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (QTDT) was
performed to identify any genotype-cytotoxicity association using QTDT
software (18).6 Due to the possible heterogeneity between and within each
population, we performed association studies in these two ethnic groups
separately using sex as a covariate, and together using sex and race as
covariates. P V 0.0001 was considered statistically significant. False
discovery rate was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction
method (19).
Genotype and gene expression association analysis. Baseline gene
expression was evaluated in 87 CEU and 89 YRI LCLs using Affymetrix
GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST array (Exon Array) as described previously
(16). A second QTDT test which integrated only those SNPs found from the
genotype cytotoxicity association was performed with mRNA gene
expression to identify possible genotype-expression association (16). A
Bonferroni correction (P < 0.05 based on the number of transcript clusters)
was used to adjust raw P values after QTDT analysis.
Gene expression and daunorubicin IC50 linear regression analysis.
To examine the relationship between gene expression and sensitivity to
daunorubicin, a general linear model was constructed with daunorubicin
IC50 (transformed using the inverse normalization of the percentile rank
function) as the dependent variable and robust multiarray average–
summarized log2-transformed gene expression level together with an
indicator for gender as the independent variables. Only gene expression
significantly associated with SNPs identified in the genotype and gene
expression associations described above were included in the analysis. A
detailed description of this model can be found in our previous publication
(16). P V 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The linkage
disequilibrium of significant SNPs within each population was evaluated
using Haploview version 3.32.7
Multivariate model to predict daunorubicin IC50 with genotypes.
To examine the overall genetic variant contributions to sensitivity of
daunorubicin, additional general linear models were constructed with
transformed daunorubicin IC50 as the dependent variable. The independent
variables included all the significant SNP genotypes (assuming an additive
genetic effect) that were selected from the three-way model in the
combined populations and the two populations independently. These SNP
genotypes were significantly associated with daunorubicin IC50 through
their effect on gene expression. Details on constructing the multivariate
model was described elsewhere (16).

used to evaluate the validity of using SNP genotypes to predict daunorubicin
sensitivity in CEU. IC50 was obtained for each LCL by performing
cytotoxicity assays as described above. Data was transformed using an
inverse normalization of percentile ranks. Genotype analysis for the
following SNPs: rs12052523, rs10083335, rs3750518, rs623360, rs2195830,
and rs1551315 was performed by single-base extension using the SNaPshot
Multiplex method (Applied Biosystems). All SNPs were amplified in separate
PCR amplicons using the following conditions: reactions were denatured
initially at 95jC for 15 min then cycled at 95jC for 30 s, at 57jC to 58jC for
30 s and at 72jC for 45 s for 40 cycles. Amplicons were pooled (20% of each
PCR product) and cleaned up by exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline
phosphatase treatment to remove excess primers and deoxynucleotide
triphosphates prior to the single-base extension reaction. SNPs were pooled
in duplex (rs2195830, rs1551315) and quadruplex (rs12052523, rs10083335,
rs3750518, rs623360) single-base extension reactions, respectively. The
single-base extension reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol (Applied Biosystems). The extension
products were separated on an ABI 3130 and analyzed by the GeneMapper
software version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems).
Multivariable model estimates daunorubicin sensitivity on validation sample set. To obtain a better genetic prediction effect for
daunorubicin IC50, we evaluated additive, dominant, and recessive models
for each of the six SNPs in the original HapMap CEU samples using the
same linear regression approach. The genetic effect that best fit the
transformed IC50 data was determined by computing R 2 for each univariate
model. After selecting the best genetic effect for each marker, the SNPs were
entered into a multivariable model to predict daunorubicin IC50 in the
validation samples using the same models.
Real-time quantitative PCR for CYP1B1 expression. CYP1B1 mRNA
expression was evaluated in 50 unrelated CEPH non–HapMap LCLs.
Exponentially growing cells were diluted at a density of 3.5  105 cells/mL
per flask. A total of 5  106 cells were pelleted and washed in ice-cold PBS
and centrifuged to remove PBS. All cell pellets were flash-frozen and
stored at 80jC until RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted using the
RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN Inc.) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA quality assessment and quantification were conducted using the
optical spectrometry (260/280 nm) ratio. Subsequently, mRNA was reverse
transcribed to cDNA using Applied Biosystems High-Capacity Reverse
Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). The final concentration of cDNA
was 50 ng/AL. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed for
CYP1B1 and an endogenous control (huB2M) using TaqMan Gene
Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) on the Applied Biosystems 7500
real-time PCR system. Total reaction was carried out in a 25 AL volume
which consisted of 12.5 AL of 2 TaqMan Gene Expression-master mix,
1.25 AL primers, and probe mix ( final concentration of 900 nmol/L
forward and reverse primers and 250 nmol/L of probe) along with 10 AL
of 1.25 ng/AL cDNA. The CYP1B1 TaqMan primers and probe were labeled
with the FAM reporter dye and the MGB quencher dye. huB2M primer/
probe mixture was labeled with the VIC reporter dye and the MGB
quencher dye. The thermocyler variables were 50jC for 2 min, 95jC for
10 min, and 40 cycles of 95jC for 15 s/60jC for 1 min. Each cycle
threshold (Ct) value obtained for CYP1B1 was normalized using huB2M
independently. A relative standard curve method was used to obtain the
relative CYP1B1 expression in our LCL samples (Guide to performing
relative qualification of gene expression using real-time quantitative
PCR),8 with the lowest CYP1B1 expression set as the calibrator for all
other LCLs. Each experiment was conducted at least twice and samples were
run in triplicate per experiment. Linear regression was then performed
between the inverse normalization of percentile ranks–transformed
daunorubicin IC50 and the relative CYP1B1 expression. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Genes Important in Daunorubicin Toxicity

Results
QTDT genotype-cytotoxicity association. Using the alamarBlue cytotoxicity assay, 86 and 89 cell lines derived from CEU
and YRI trios were exposed to increasing concentrations of
daunorubicin (0.0125–1 Amol/L) for 72 hours and the IC50 was
determined by curve-fitting the percentage of cell survival against
concentrations of the drug (17). Interindividual variation in the
IC50 was 40-fold and 54-fold with the median IC50 at 0.04 and
0.05 Amol/L in CEU and YRI cell lines, respectively (17). We started
by evaluating 387,417 SNPs, representing 22,667 genes, for
significant association with daunorubicin IC50. Using a P value
threshold (P V 0.0001), 207, 233, and 189 SNPs were found to
significantly associate with daunorubicin IC50 in the combined
CEU and YRI populations, and individual CEU and YRI populations,
respectively (Table 1). These SNPs were located in or within 10 kb
upstream/downstream of 115, 105, and 104 genes. Raw P V 0.0001
corresponded to a false discovery rate of 0.167, 0.145, and 0.184 in
the combined, CEU, and YRI populations, respectively.
QTDT genotype and gene expression association. To obtain
equally enriched gene expression data, we generated expression
data on 176 LCLs (87 CEU and 89 YRI) using Exon Array. The QTDT
association analysis was conducted between gene expression and
the SNPs that were significantly associated with daunorubicin IC50.
A total of 13,314 transcript clusters with a mean log2-transformed
gene expression intensity of >5, indicating expression in both
CEU and YRI samples, were included in the analysis. In terms of
expression, we found 15 cis- and 54 trans-acting relationships in the
combined populations, 9 cis- and 48 trans-acting relationships in
CEU, and 1 cis- and 47 trans-acting relationships in YRI (Bonferronicorrected P < 0.05 based on number of transcript clusters). Among
all observed cis- and trans-acting relationships, some SNPs were
significantly associated with more than one gene expression,
whereas some gene expressions were associated with more than
one SNP. Therefore, the final cis/trans-acting relationships were
represented by 38 SNPs that significantly associated with 36 gene
expressions in the combined population, 30 SNPs that significantly
associated with 17 gene expressions in CEU, and 20 SNPs that
significantly associated with 42 gene expressions in YRI (Table 1,
Supplementary Table S1).
Linear regression of gene expression and daunorubicin IC50.
We examined the correlation between gene expression and
daunorubicin IC50 using a general linear model that was
constructed to reflect the relationship among the trio structure
of samples in our data. Fourteen transcript clusters (representing
16 genes) had significant correlations with daunorubicin IC50 in the
combined populations (P V 0.05; Table 1). In the same manner, we
found 9 and 36 genes whose expressions significantly correlated
with daunorubicin IC50 in the CEU and YRI populations,
respectively (P V 0.05; Table 1).

When combining the results generated from association tests
between genotypes, daunorubicin IC50 and gene expression, as well
as the linear regression between gene expression and daunorubicin
IC50, we identified 26, 9, and 18 SNPs that were significantly
associated with daunorubicin IC50 through association with 16, 9,
and 36 gene expressions in the combined, CEU, and YRI
populations, respectively. One example was the significant
association between the genotype of rs10932125 (chromosome 2)
and daunorubicin IC50 (P = 1  10 4). This SNP was associated
with the expression of the CYP1B1 gene (P = 1  10 6), which
significantly correlated with daunorubicin IC50 (P = 3  10 5;
Fig. 1). This data indicates that CYP1B1 confers resistance to
daunorubicin. In the individual CEU population, we identified
rs3750518 (chromosome 9) to be associated with daunorubicin
IC50 (P = 8  10 5) and HNRPD gene expression (P = 3  10 6). We
also found an inverse correlation between the HNRPD expression
and daunorubicin IC50 (P = 5  10 4; Fig. 2). In the YRI population,
we identified a strong association between the genotype of SNP
rs6603859 and daunorubicin IC50 (P = 5  10 5). This SNP
genotype was also significantly associated with the expression of
the TAP2 gene located on chromosome 6 (P = 3  10 6). The GG
genotype of rs6603859 was associated with higher TAP2 gene
expression and higher daunorubicin IC50. This was further
indicated by the positive correlation found between TAP2 gene
expression and daunorubicin IC50 (P = 7  10 3; Fig. 3), which
indicates that this gene confers resistance to daunorubicin. In
addition, we identified a significant association between daunorubicin IC50 and the genotype of SNP rs7929521 in YRI (P = 5  10 5).
This same SNP genotype was significantly associated with the
expression of the IKBKE gene located on chromosome 1 (P =
2  10 6). The GG genotype of rs7929521 was associated with
higher IKBKE gene expression and higher daunorubicin IC50. This
was further indicated by the positive correlation found between
IKBKE gene expression and daunorubicin IC50 (P = 3  10 3;
Fig. 4).
Multivariate model to predict daunorubicin IC50 with
genotypes. To examine the overall contributions of our selected
genetic variants to the sensitivity of daunorubicin, additional
general linear models were constructed. In the combined
populations, 8 of the 26 tested SNPs were selected in the final
model (P < 0.04 for all SNPs). Specifically, rs10932125, rs17128525,
rs2053456, rs2664420, rs11743052, rs1412312, rs6859237, and
rs7704526 were all significant predictors of daunorubicin IC50.
Race is also a significant predictor of daunorubicin IC50 (P =
0.0042). This was in agreement with our phenotypic finding that
daunorubicin IC50 was significantly different between the CEU and
YRI populations (17). Computing a weighted sum of r 2 from each
group of unrelated individuals gives an overall estimate of r 2 = 0.47,
indicating that 47% of the variation in daunorubicin IC50 can be

CEU population, six of the nine tested SNPs were included in the
final model (P < 0.04 for rs10083335, rs12052523, rs2195830,
rs3750518, and rs623360; and P = 0.05 for rs1551315). When all six
SNPs were included in the model, the overall estimate was r 2 = 0.61,
indicating that 61% of the daunorubicin IC50 variation could be
explained by these six SNPs in the CEU population. In the YRI

(P < 0.04 for all SNPs). Specifically, rs9730073, rs12250538,

determined. Using the single-base extension method, we obtained
genotyping information for all six SNP genotypes. We tested
dominant and recessive effects for each of these six SNPs in the
HapMap CEU samples and used the same genetic model
assumptions for the non-HapMap CEU validation set. Upon
evaluation in HapMap CEU, rs1551315 best fits the data when
dominant genetic effects were assumed, rs12052523 best fits the

data when recessive genetic effects were assumed, whereas
rs2195830, rs623360, rs10083335, and rs3750518 best fit the data

SNPs was 0.29. Two markers, rs120525235 and rs3750518, were
significant predictors of transformed daunorubicin IC50 (P = 0.005
and P = 0.0008, respectively). One marker is trending towards
statistical significance in the replication set (rs1551315, P = 0.089).
The remaining three SNPs do not significantly predict IC50. The
validation step identifies which SNPs are more likely to be true
positives.
Effect of CYP1B1 on daunorubicin sensitivity. Our data shows
a significant correlation between CYP1B1 expression and daunorubicin IC50 (Fig. 1), we therefore set out to evaluate the effect of
CYP1B1 expression on the cellular sensitivity to daunorubicin in
the 50 independent CEPH non-HapMap LCLs. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed for CYP1B1 using expression of huB2M
as an endogenous control. A linear regression was performed
between the relative CYP1B1 expression and the inverse normalization of percentile ranks–transformed daunorubicin IC50. We
found a significant correlation between CYP1B1 expression and
daunorubicin IC50 in agreement with our findings in the HapMap
samples (Fig. 5).

Discussion
Using a genome-wide, unbiased approach that sequentially
evaluated whole genome association between genotype and
phenotype (sensitivity to drug), followed by the association
between genotype and gene expression, as well as linear regression
analysis between gene expression and phenotype, we successfully
identified 53 genetic variants (26 in the combined, 9 in the CEU, 18
in the YRI populations) significantly associated with daunorubicininduced cytotoxicity through the expression of 61 genes in CEU
and/or YRI cell lines. A multivariate model indicated that f47%,
61%, and 63% of the observed daunorubicin IC50 variations could
be explained by eight, six, and six SNPs identified through our
model in the combined, CEU, and YRI populations, respectively.
The CEU results were further tested in an independent set of 50
unrelated CEPH LCLs. Two of the six SNPs generated as predictors
from our HapMap samples were able to explain f29% of the
daunorubicin sensitivity in the validation set. Furthermore, in this
same independent set of samples, we found a significant
correlation between CYP1B1 expression and daunorubicin IC50
suggesting that CYP1B1 confers resistance to daunorubicin.

Until recently, few studies used LCLs to determine whether
genetic factors contributed to chemotherapeutic-induced cytotoxicity. Using LCLs derived from large pedigrees, our laboratory
found that 47% of the variations in susceptibility to cisplatin were
due to genetic factors (20). Variation in cellular susceptibility to
5-fluorouracil and docetaxel (21), and daunorubicin (29% of
variation in IC50 due to genetic factors, P = 8  10 7; ref. 11)
were also shown to have a significant genetic component.
We have previously described a linkage-directed association
approach to identify genetic variants that contribute to daunorubicin cytotoxicity (11). Although our previous approach is cellbased, the previous study differs substantially from the cell-based
model described herein. Differences include (a) in the previous
publication (11), 24 large pedigrees consisting of 324 individual cell
lines were used to perform linkage analysis followed by linkage
directed QTDT on a subset of samples (87 HapMap CEU samples).
The rationale for using large pedigrees was to determine regions
on the genome that harbored genetic variation contributing to
susceptibility to differing drug concentrations in the CEU
population. That approach allowed us to test if different genes
(upstream or downstream of the damage) contribute to variations
in the sensitivity to low versus high concentrations of daunorubicin. In the current study, we are evaluating genetic variants that are
associated with daunorubicin cytotoxicity through their effect on
baseline gene expression in CEU, YRI, and combined populations
using the IC50 as the cytotoxic phenotype. We further validated
experimental findings for the genetic predictors and gene
expression of CYP1B1 in a separate set of non-HapMap CEU LCLs.
Of the significant SNPs that were associated with daunorubicin IC50
through gene expressions using our current approach, five are
under suggestive linkage peaks. These SNPs are rs1831567 (13q32),
rs1412312 (13q32), rs6897941 (5q12.3), rs7704526 (5q35), and
rs12052523 (2q36.3), providing greater confidence in their importance in contributing to variation in sensitivity to daunorubicin.
One limitation of multiple testing is the resulting false discovery
rate. Stringent statistical cutoffs are used to decrease the false
discovery rates (22). We have a relatively small sample size (90 CEU
or YRI populations or 180 for the combined populations) to
perform genome-wide association tests on the complex trait (e.g.,
susceptibility to drugs). Our goal was to set a cutoff that would
detect genetic contributions to the trait, but also control for the
false discovery rate; therefore, a threshold of P V 10 4 was chosen
for the association between SNP genotype and daunorubicin IC50.
Theoretically, given the 387,417 SNPs tested, this cutoff would
produce 39 significant SNPs by chance, although our test found
207, 233, and 189 SNPs that met this cutoff and were associated
with daunorubicin IC50 in combined, CEU, and YRI populations,
respectively. Once these were identified, we narrowed down our
genetic variants list to 26, 9, and 18 SNPs that significantly
associated with the expression of 16, 9, and 36 genes that were
also significantly correlated with daunorubicin IC50 (P < 0.05) in
combined, CEU, and YRI populations, respectively. Given the
stringent statistical cutoffs, we did not observe any overlap of SNPs
between the CEU and YRI populations. This was not surprising due
to the heterogeneity between the CEU and YRI samples. Neither
did we observe SNPs that overlapped between the combined
populations and the individual populations. The larger number of
samples in the combined populations provides more power to
detect smaller genetic effects on cytotoxicity and gene expression;
however, the unique genetic findings in one population may be
masked by the noise produced by a lack of genetic effects in the

Genes Important in Daunorubicin Toxicity

other population. Thus, we interpreted the final results in each
separate population as population-specific genetic variants that
contribute to daunorubicin toxicity, whereas those in the combined
population were genetic variants important to drug-induced
toxicity regardless of population tested.
Our model allowed us to uncover previously unknown genetic
variants that are likely important in daunorubicin cytotoxicity. In
the combined population, we identified three SNPs located within
the ChGn gene on chromosome 8 that trans-regulated the
expression of ADD3 and also associated with daunorubicin IC50.
Gyorffy et al. showed a significant correlation between ADD3
expression and resistance of 30 cancer cell lines towards
doxorubicin (23). In addition, we identified a significant association
between the genotype of rs10932125 (chromosome 2), expression of
CYP1B1 (chromosome 2) and daunorubicin IC50. It has been shown
in rat liver microsomes that CYP2B1 may play a role in the
metabolism of doxorubicin (24); however, in the literature, evidence
for genes important in daunorubicin metabolism is sparse. Our
data in HapMap cell lines and in non-HapMap CEPH LCLs
supports the concept that expression of CYP1B1 confers resistance
to daunorubicin. We are studying the metabolic conversion of
daunorubicin by CYP1B1.
Significant associations between genetic variants of rs3750518,
HNRPD expression, and daunorubicin IC50 were found in the CEU
population. This SNP was significantly associated with the
expression of the HNRPD gene located on chromosome 4. The
protein encoded by HNRPD [heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1) or AUF1] is a
member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(hnRNP) subfamily, which are complexed with heterogeneous
nRNA and regulate the mRNA stability. Lapucci et al. have shown
that HNRPD can bind to AU-rich elements in the 3¶-untranslated
region of the bcl-2 gene and consequently induce apoptosis after
UVC irradiation in the transfected Jurkat T-cell leukemia cell line
(25). Furthermore, it has been shown that cell death–inhibiting
RNA inhibits apoptosis by acting as a competitive inhibitor of
AUF1, preventing AUF1 from binding to its targets (26). Our study
showed that the GG genotype of SNP rs3750518 associated with
higher HNRPD gene expression and greater sensitivity to
daunorubicin in agreement with evidence in the literature that
higher HNRPD expression increases apoptosis, and thus, could
potentially lead to higher sensitivity to cellular stress induced by
daunorubicin.
In the YRI population, we identified a strong association
between genetic variants of SNP rs6603859 (chr1) and the
expression of six genes (TAP2, chr6; OGDH, chr7; RASSF7, chr11;
PYGB, chr20; SAPS2, chr22; and LOC442582, chr22). This SNP was
also associated with the susceptibility to daunorubicin-induced
cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the expressions of all six genes were
significantly correlated with daunorubicin IC50. Interestingly, one of
the target genes, TAP2 [transporter 2, ATP-binding cassette,
subfamily B (MDR/TAP)], forms a heterodimer with ABCB2 in
order to transport peptides from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic
reticulum. Transfection of the TAP gene into TAP-deficient
lymphoblastoid T2 cells conferred mild resistance to etoposide,
vincristine, and doxorubicin (2-fold to 2.5-fold; ref. 27). Our study
showed that the GG genotype of this SNP was associated with
higher TAP2 gene expression and correlated with lower sensitivity
to daunorubicin.
Another interesting finding in YRI was the significant association
between genetic variants of SNP rs7929521, gene expression of

www.aacrjournals.org

IKBKE [inhibitor of n light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells,
kinase q] and susceptibility to daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity.
This SNP is significantly associated with the expression of five
genes (RPL7A, RASSF5, IKBKE, IDH3A, and SLC9A8). In most cells,
nuclear factor nB (NFnB) is trapped in the cytoplasm by InB. Under
stimulation, InB undergoes phosphorylation by InB kinase complex
(IKK or IKBK), ubiquitinylation, and degradation. Released NFnB
migrates into the nucleus and activates target gene expression
(28, 29). It has been shown that inhibition of NFnB activation can
result in increased sensitivity to anthracyclines (30, 31). Tergaonkar
et al. have shown IKKa-independent and IKKh-independent
activation of NFnB by doxorubicin (32). Buss et al. have indicated
that interleukin-1–inducible phosphorylation of p65 NFnB at Ser536
is mediated by multiple protein kinases including IKKa, IKKh,
IKKq, TRAF family member-associated–binding kinase 1 (TBK1),
and an unknown kinase (33). Moreover, Adli et al. have shown
IKBKE in controlling the proliferation of certain cancer cells
through regulation of constitutive NFnB activity (34). Our study
revealed that the expression of IKBKE was significantly associated
with daunorubicin cytotoxicity.
Candidate gene approaches have commonly focused on one
gene/pathway, the expression of which is associated with
sensitivity to the drug. For example, increased activity of drug
efflux transporter, i.e., ABCB1 (p-glycoprotein), ABCG2, and LRP
(35–38), and the decreased activity of topoisomerase II have been
shown to be associated with resistance to doxorubicin in cancer
cell lines (39). In addition, the expression of c-raf, bcl-2 (40), p53
(41, 42), and CYP2B1 (24) were also shown to correlate with
resistance to anthracyclines. Further studies to evaluate whether
genetic polymorphisms within these candidate genes were
associated with sensitivity to doxorubicin were negative (43–45).
This could be due in part to the multigenic nature of druginduced toxicity and the limited selection of genetic variants
within or close to the gene of interest. Recently, several groups
have shown that expression of a considerable number of genes is
directly controlled by trans-acting elements (22, 46–50). Limited
information is available on genetic polymorphisms associated
with daunorubicin; thus, our genome-wide approach giving equal
weight to all genes and identifying multiple genetic polymorphisms both cis and trans to the genes associated with
daunorubicin-induced cytotoxicity offers investigators genetic
variants worth further investigation. The final list of genes in
our approach only includes genetic variants that affect cytotoxicity through effects on gene expression but does not include
genetic variants that may change expression following drug
exposure or variants affecting protein structure, activity, and/or
degradation. However, the association test between daunorubicin
IC50 and genotype (the first step of our model) is inclusive of all
genetic variants that act through other means. In addition, we
used 387,417 very informative SNPs (located in or near genes) in
the genome-wide association to facilitate the most likely
candidates for follow-up functional validation studies. An
important caveat is that these SNPs are sparser than the full
HapMap genotypes; therefore, it is plausible that these SNPs may
only be ‘‘surrogate’’ genetic markers whereas other SNPs located
in other regions of the genome are the actual causative genetic
markers.
In summary, this genome-wide approach successfully integrated
genotype, gene expression, and sensitivity with drug information
to identify genetic variants that are important in drug cytotoxicity.
The model can be used to uncover important genetic variants
