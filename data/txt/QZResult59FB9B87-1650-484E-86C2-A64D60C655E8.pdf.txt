ABSTRACT
p21-Activated kinase 6 (PAK6) has been implicated in radiotherapy and docetaxel
resistance. We have further evaluated PAK6 as a predictor of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) treatment response in colon cancer. Here we report that in colon cancer PAK6
promotes tumor progression and chemoresistance both in vitro and in vivo. In the
clinical analysis, PAK6 was overexpressed in 104 of 147 (70.75%) stage II and III
patients who received 5-FU based chemotherapy after surgery. Multivariate Cox
regression analysis indicated that PAK6 was an independent prognostic factor for
overall survival (P < 0.001) and disease-free survival (P < 0.001). Colon cancer cell
lines showed increased PAK6 expression upon 5-FU treatment. In PAK6-knockdown
cells treated with 5-FU, cell viability and phosphorylation of BAD decreased, and
the number of apoptotic cells, levels of cleaved caspase 3 and PARP increased
compared to control cells. The opposite was observed in PAK6 overexpressing cells.
Short hairpin RNA knockdown of PAK6 blocked cells in G2-M phase. Furthermore,
Animal experiments results in vivo are consistent with outcomes in vitro. This study
demonstrates that PAK6 is an independent prognostic factor for adjuvant 5-FU-based
chemotherapy in patients with stage II and stage III colon cancer.

INTRODUCTION

especially for stage II and III colon cancer patients [3-5].
Recently, the development of 5-FU resistance during the
course of treatment, which is an important cause of colon
cancer therapy failure, has become more common [6-8].
However, laboratory studies investigating the molecular
biology of cancer initiation and progression have so
far provided little information regarding the molecular
mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance. In
order to more effectively target colon cancer treatment
in the future, it is important to identify patients who are

Colon cancer is the third leading cause of cancer
deaths worldwide [1]. Although surgical resection alone
is potentially curative, local or distant recurrences develop
in many patients. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based systemic
adjuvant chemotherapy has been suggested for patients
with a high risk of recurrence, and has been shown to be
beneficial in a number of trials [2]. Despite these advances,
the role of chemotherapy in colon cancer is still debated,

at risk of recurrence while receiving 5-FU-based therapy.
As such, exploring useful biomarkers for 5-FU-based
chemotherapeutic sensitivity in patients with colon cancer
is clinically important.
p21-Activated kinases (PAKs) are a family of
Rac/Cdc42-associated Ser/Thr protein kinases that
phosphorylate small GTPase effectors. They have been
implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular functions,
including actin reorganization, cell motility, gene
transcription, cell transformation, apoptotic signaling, and
more recently, radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistance
signaling [9-12]. PAK6 is the most recently identified,
and least well understood, member of the PAK family
of proteins. In recent years, PAK6 has been shown to be
principally overexpressed in the brain and testes, although
low levels have been detected in numerous tissues,
including the prostate and breast [13]. Knockdown of
PAK6 expression results in the inhibition of prostate
cancer growth and enhanced chemosensitivity to docetaxel
[14]. When combined with irradiation, inhibition of
PAK6 results in significantly decreased prostate cancer
cell survival [9]. However, in colon cancer patients who
receive adjuvant chemotherapy after tumor resection,
the role of PAK6 remains unclear. The aim of this study
was to evaluate whether PAK6 can influence 5-FU-based
chemotherapeutic sensitivity in colon cancer cells, and

determine whether PAK6 expression is a useful marker
for guiding 5-FU adjuvant therapy after curative resection
of colon cancer. In this study, we used quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blotting,
and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess PAK6
expression, and found that it was markedly increased in
colon cancer tissues relative to normal colon epithelium.
We subsequently sought to assess the effects of PAK6
expression on the 5-FU-based chemotherapy in colon cells
by downregulating and overexpressing PAK6 mRNA and
protein, and tried to elucidate the possible mechanisms
underlying PAK6 mediated chemotherapy resistance.

RESULTS
Aberrant overexpression of PAK6 in colon cancer
tissues
Of the 40 randomly selected paired cases that were
used to evaluate PAK6 mRNA and protein expression, 26
(65%) colon cancers had at least a 2-fold increase in PAK6
mRNA levels compared to the adjacent noncancerous
tissues. This difference in PAK6 mRNA expression was
significant (P < 0.001, Fig. 1A). Subsequent western

levels compared to noncancerous tissue was observed in 26 (65%) of 40 colon cancers. The logarithmic scale 2-ΔΔCt was used to represent

higher in the colon cancer samples than in the matched
adjacent non-tumor tissues (Fig. 1B). These results suggest
that PAK6 is upregulated in colon cancer.

localized in the cytoplasm of cancer cells, with strong
staining in the cancer mucosa. We found that PAK6 was
dramatically upregulated in 104 of 147 (70.75%) primary
colon cancer patients specimens, but was either absent or
only minimally expressed 9 of 147 (6.12%) in the adjacent
normal colonic tissue. The IHC staining quantitative
analysis is summarized in Table 1. We observed that the
level of PAK6 expression was closely correlated with
tumor differentiation (P = 0.002) and recurrence (P <
0.001) in colon cancer patients. Collectively, these data
indicate that PAK6 may be involved in colon cancer
progression.

Association between PAK6 expression and the
clinical features of colon cancer
To determine whether PAK6 expression correlated
with colon cancer progression, the expression of PAK6
was determined by IHC in 147 stage II and III patients
who accepted 5-FU-based chemotherapy after radical
colectomy. As shown in Fig. 1C, PAK6 protein was

High PAK6 expression is associated with a poor
clinical outcome in human colon cancer

5-FU induces upregulation of PAK6 expression
To investigate the role of PAK6 in mediating
sensitivity to colon cancer chemotherapy, we used 2
human colon cancer cell lines, HCT8 and HCT116.
Western blot analysis showed that both untreated cell lines
expressed PAK6 protein. Following treatment with 10 μM
5-FU, a gradual increase in the PAK6 mRNA levels was
observed in both HCT8 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 3A). To
examine whether PAK6 protein levels were also altered
after 5-FU treatment, western blot analysis was performed.
As shown in Fig. 3B, PAK6 levels increased following
5-FU treatment in both cell lines, which was similar to
our qPCR data. SW480 cells, which are less malignant
than HCT116 and HCT8 cells, showed very weak PAK6
expression before and after 5-FU treatment (data not
shown).

Results from the IHC analysis of 147 stage II and
III tissues indicated that there was a significant difference
between the PAK6-positive and PAK6-negative groups
in the number of patients who developed primary colon
cancer recurrence after 5-FU-based chemotherapy; more
of the patients with PAK6-positive tumors underwent
subsequent recurrence than the patients with PAK6negative tumors (P < 0.001). Positive PAK6 expression
(weak and strong) was associated with a 2.221-fold
increased risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.221;
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.532–3.220]; P < 0.001).
We used the Kaplan-Meier analysis to show that the
expression of PAK6 was significantly correlated with the
disease-free survival (DFS) of colon cancer patients (logrank test, P < 0.001; Fig. 2A). Patients with PAK6-positive
tumors had significantly lower 5-year overall survival
(OS) than those with PAK6-negative tumors (HR, 2.335;
95% CI, 1.203–4.535; P < 0.001; Fig. 2B). In multivariate
analysis using the clinicopathological variables such as
differentiation grade and vessel invasion, the expression
of PAK6 was an independent prognostic marker to predict
patient outcomes (Table 2); this suggests that PAK6 is
of clinical significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of
patients with stage II and III colon carcinomas who are
treated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy.

PAK6 increases cell viability
Western blot analysis was used to confirm the
efficiency of PAK6 knockdown (KD) and overexpression
(Fig. 3C and Fig. S1A). MTT cell viability assays were
performed following 5-FU treatment and, as shown in Fig.
4A and Fig. S1B, cell viability was reduced by 5-FU in a
dose-dependent manner. PAK6-KD with short hairpin (sh)
RNA shifted the survival curves for HCT8 and HCT116
cells downwards; conversely, PAK6 overexpression
in SW840 cells increased survival. To determine how
PAK6 inhibition affects cell viability, MTT assays were

showed a significant reduction in cell viability with all 3
incubation times (24, 48, and 72 h) compared to control
cells (Fig. 4B). In summary, targeted inhibition of PAK6
sensitized HCT8 and HCT116 cells to chemotherapy
while overexpression of PAK6 increased SW480
chemoresistance. These data indicated that PAK6 mediates
colon cancer cell chemoresistance.

compared to shNT control cells (Fig. 5B); conversely,
in SW480/ PAK6 cells, PAK6 overexpression lead to a
reduction in apoptosis compared with SW480/ vector
cells. (Fig. S1C). Together, these data indicate that
PAK6 overexpression in tumor cells is responsible for
resistance to 5-FU-induced apoptosis. To further explore
the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-apoptotic
role of PAK6, we examined 2 biochemical markers of
apoptosis, poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase
(PARP) and cleaved caspase 3, in the shRNA stable cell
lines. After a 48 h treatment with 10 μM 5-FU, cleaved
PARP and caspase 3 were detected in the PAK6-KD cell
lines (Fig. 6A); conversely, in the shNT cell lines, which
are resistant to apoptosis, the majority of the PARP and
caspase 3 proteins were uncleaved and remained fulllength. Similarly, the SW480/vector cells showed higher
levels of cleaved PARP and caspase 3 compared to the
SW480/PAK6 cells (Fig. S2A). These results suggest
that PAK6-KD may confer sensitivity to 5-FU-induced
apoptosis. The B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 family of proteins
are known to be closely associated with apoptosis. It has
been reported that when Bcl-2-associated death promoter
(BAD) protein is phosphorylated, it ceases to interact with
Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, which prevents the release of cytochrome
c and suppresses apoptosis [15]. As shown in Fig. 6B, a
significant decrease in phosphorylated-BAD (p-BAD) was
observed in PAK6-KD cells treated with 5-FU for 48 h;
in control cells a slight increase in p-BAD was observed
after 5-FU treatment, and similar results were obtained
in HCT116 cells (Fig. 6C). SW480/PAK6 cells showed
increased p-BAD compared to SW480/vector cells (Fig.
S2B). Taken together, these findings indicate that PAK6

PAK6-KD sensitizes cells to apoptosis
We proceeded to explore the role of PAK6 in
chemotherapeutic resistance. In both HCT8 and HCT116
cells, transduction with PAK6-shRNA resulted in a
significant increase in G2/M-phase cells, and a reciprocal
decrease in G0/G1-phase cells, compared to cells that
had been transduced with a non-targeting shRNA (shNT;
Fig. 5A). This effect was augmented by the addition of
5-FU. However, 5-FU treatment of the shNT control cells
increased the proportion of S-phase cells. These data
indicate that at the time of 5-FU treatment, the cells were
blocked in a more chemosensitive stage of the cell cycle
(Table S1).

PAK6 rescues cells from 5-FU induced apoptosis
Cell survival was assessed using annexin V and
propidium iodide (PI) staining after a 48 h incubation
with 10 μM 5-FU. In PAK6-KD HCT8 and HCT116 cells,
5-FU treatment induced a 2-fold increase in apoptosis

expression confers a more aggressive phenotype and
resistance to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in colon cancer.
Upregulation of PAK6 has previously been verified
in primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer, and has been
shown to be further increased in tumors that relapse after
androgen deprivation therapy [16, 17]. In addition, PAK6
expression has been found to be decreased in renal cell
carcinoma, but increased in hepatocellular carcinoma;
PAK6 expression is also thought to be a potentially useful
marker for the differentiation of human uterine cervical
adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma [1820]. In the present study, we initially measured PAK6
expression in fresh frozen colon cancer specimens and
found that PAK6 mRNA and protein levels were higher in
colon tumor tissues than in the surrounding noncancerous
mucosa. These data indicated that PAK6 was upregulated
at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level.
Further validation by IHC showed that PAK6 protein was
localized to the cytoplasm of cancer cells, and 104 of 147
(70.75%) primary colon cancers showed positive staining;
only 9 of 147 (6.12%) normal colonic epithelium were
immunoreactive for PAK6. Thus, we have provided the
first clinical evidence that PAK6 might play an important
role in the progression of colon carcinogenesis.
Until now, no valid prognostic biomarkers for colon
cancer chemotherapy have been established, although
several potential molecular predictors of recurrence risk
and chemotherapy benefit have been investigated (e.g.,
KRAS expression, levels of DNA mismatch repair,
and p53 expression) [21, 22]. However, so far, only
KRAS mutation analysis has been used clinically as
a predictive marker for the efficacy of anti-epidermal
growth factor receptor antibodies in metastatic disease

PAK6 promotes colon cancer growth in vivo
Based on the in vitro findings described above, we
proceeded to investigate the tumorigenicity of PAK6-KD
and shNT cells when subcutaneously injected into the
abdomen of nude mice that were/were not treated with
5-FU. All of the mice survived the transplantation and
appeared healthy. The tumor growth curves and harvested
tumor weights are shown in Fig. 7A and Fig. 7B. As
anticipated, the tumor growth and tumor weights were
significant decreased in the PAK6-KD group compared to
the control group. An even more significant reduction was
observed in the PAK6-KD group treated with 5-FU. These
in vivo data are consistent with the in vitro results, and
confirm that PAK6 overexpression promotes colon cancer
progress and 5-FU chemoresistance.

DISCUSSION
This is the first report showing evidence for PAK6
playing a critical role in colon cancer pathogenesis
and chemoresistance. The data presented support the
hypothesis that PAK6 could serve as a prognostic indicator
of colon cancer outcome in patients with stage II and III
disease treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy
following curative surgery. Furthermore, the presented
mechanistic evidence strongly suggests that dysregulated
PAK6 expression confers 5-FU chemoresistance in
colon cancer cells. Collectively, our novel clinical and
mechanistic data demonstrate that increased PAK6

[23]. The analysis of other known critical colon cancer
genes is neither recommended for screening nor used as
a prognostic indicator, in particular for stage II and III
patients [4, 5, 24]. Patients with stage II colon cancer are
considered for adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment if,
based on clinical and pathological evaluation, they are
deemed to be at a high risk of relapse [25]. According to
the recommendations of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology, adverse factors include an advanced T stage,
few examined lymph nodes, low tumor differentiation, and
tumor perforation [26]. However, these clinicopathological
risk factors do not clearly distinguish between patients
who have a high or low risk of disease recurrence, and do
not predict which patients are likely to specifically benefit
from chemotherapy [27]. In the present study, stage II and
III patients with high levels of tumor PAK6 expression
showed an increased risk of tumor recurrence when treated
with 5-FU-based chemotherapy after radical surgery.
Furthermore, for stage II and III colon cancer patients, high
PAK6 expression was an independent prognostic factor for
OS (P < 0.001) and DFS (P < 0.001). All of these results
indicate that PAK6 has the potential to predict 5-FUsusceptibility in patients with stage II and stage III colon
cancer. This information could help to inform clinical
decisions and target therapeutics to patient subgroups with
an increased likelihood of disease recurrence. However,
our current study is limited in that it was conducted
retrospectively and has limited generalizability because all
of the patients were Chinese. As such, further investigation
into the potential clinical application of our results to
colon cancer therapy should be conducted, especially in
regards to improving chemotherapeutic outcomes for stage
II and III colon cancers.
5-FU is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent
that damages DNA and inhibits cancer growth by initiating
apoptosis [6]. Anti-cancer drug resistance can result from
various causes, including alterations in drug influx and
efflux, enhanced drug inactivation, and mutation of the
drug target [28]. High levels of thymidylate synthase
expression [29], increased deoxyuridine triphosphatase
activity [30], and MLH1 gene methylation [31] have all
been reported to lead to 5-FU drug resistance; as such,
multiple factors appear to be able to contribute to 5-FU
resistance [32], and it is likely that many mechanisms
of 5-FU drug resistance remain to be demonstrated.
An effective method to identify potential therapeutic
targets associated with chemoresistance is to compare
gene expression in human colon cells before and after
chemotherapy [33]. The present study has shown that
PAK6 is significantly upregulated in both HCT8 and
HCT116 cells following 5-FU treatment. Therefore, PAK6
overexpression may influence the response of colon cells
to 5-FU chemotherapy. To clarify the functional role of
PAK6 in chemotherapy, we used an shRNA-based strategy
to stably downregulate PAK6 in colon cancer cells that
express high levels of the protein, and overexpressed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PAK6 in colon cancer cells that express low levels of the
protein. We showed that attenuation of PAK6 protein by
shRNA decreased cell viability, and overexpression of
PAK6 increased viability. Moreover, transduction of colon
cancer cells with PAK6 shRNA resulted in cellular arrest
in G2-M stage, a more chemosensitive stage of the cell
cycle. Therefore, at the time of 5-FU treatment, cells were
arrested in a more chemosensitive stage of the cell cycle.
A key mechanism through which cancer cells
become resistant to chemotherapy is by the disruption
of the pathways that lead to apoptosis [34]. In this study,
it was shown that in colon cancer cells, PAK6 inhibition
significantly increased the extent of 5-FU induced
apoptosis and increasing PAK6 protein expression
decreased apoptosis, supporting the notion that PAK6
plays a role in apoptosis evasion. To further explore the
mechanism by which PAK6 mediates chemoresistance,
we examined PARP and caspase 3 cleavage and BAD
phosphorylation. In PAK6-KD cells treated with 5-FU,
significantly more cleaved PARP and caspase 3 and
less p-BAD were detected compared to control cells; in
PAK6 overexpressing cells, the opposite was observed,
indicating that PAK6 may confer chemoresistance through
anti-apoptotic pathways.
In summary, our results indicate that a combination
of PAK6 inhibition and 5-FU treatment results in
significantly decreased survival in colon cancer cells,
which can be restored by PAK6 expression. These
findings highlight the potential role that PAK6 may play
in chemoresistance and indicate that PAK6 could be an
effective target for 5-FU sensitization in colon cancer,
although further research is required to confirm our
findings. Finally, we were able to confirm the role of
PAK6 in colon cancer progression in animal models. Our
study indicated that tumor growth and tumor weights were
significantly decreased in PAK6-KD tumor xenografts,
especially when treated with 5-FU. These results were
consistent with our in vitro results and suggest that
PAK6 is a critical protein responsible for 5-FU-based
chemoresistance.
In conclusion, our study indicates that PAK6
decreases 5-FU drug susceptibility in colon cancer cells
and is an independent prognostic factor for adjuvant 5-FUbased chemotherapy in patients with stage II and stage III
colon cancer. This suggests that at the time of an initial
colon cancer diagnosis, PAK6 expression might be used to
not only identify the optimal individualized treatment, but
also to distinguish patients who are more likely to benefit
from chemotherapy after surgery.

Establishment of PAK6-KD cell lines
Commercially available PAK6 shRNA constructs
were obtained (Genechem Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China)

HCT8 and HCT116 cells were transduced with 5
× 105 transducing units/mL of lentivirus particles. The
transduction efficiency was 87% and 92% for HCT8
and HCT116 cells, respectively. Antibiotic selection (1
µg/mL puromycin) was initiated for 7 days 24 h after
transduction. As a result, 2 HCT8 PAK6-KD stable cell
lines (HCT8 PAK6-KD1 and PAK6-KD2) and 2 HCT116
PAK6-KD stable cell lines (HCT116 PAK6-KD1 and
PAK6-KD2) were generated. Cells transduced with shNT
(HCT8 shNT and HCT116 shNT) were used as controls.

Patients and clinical database
This study used tumor specimens from 147 stage II
and III colon cancer patients, enrolled from January 2001
to December 2003, who underwent radical resection and
received 5-FU-based chemotherapy after surgery. The
clinicopathological factors of all the patients are presented
in Table 1. The patients were followed by history and
physical surveillance every 3 months for 2 years, then
every 6 months up to 5 years, and finally annually.
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient
before entering the study and all study protocols were
approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research
of Shanghai Jiaotong University affiliated Shanghai First
People’s Hospital Medical Center.

IHC
Immunostaining was performed using a GT
Vision III Kit (Genetech, Shanghai, China). After
antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min,
specimen slides were incubated overnight at 4°C with the
primary antibody against PAK6 (1:100, Cell Signaling
Technology, USA). The slides were then incubated with
the secondary antibody (Genetech, Shanghai, China)
for 30 min at room temperature. Tissue sections were
counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. The intensity
and extent of staining was independently evaluated by 2
pathologists who were blinded to patient outcomes. The
staining intensity was scored as 0 (no staining), 1 (mild
staining), 2 (moderate staining), or 3 (intense staining).
The staining area was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1%–25%), 2
(26%–50%), 3 (51%–75%), or 4 (76%–100%) according
to the percentage of positively-stained cells. The final
staining scores, calculated by the sum of the intensity
and area scores, were divided into 3 groups as follows:
0–2, negative expression; 3–4, weak expression; and 5–6,
strong expression. In cases where there was a discrepancy
between the pathologist’s assessments, the slides were
re-examined by both pathologists under a multi-head
microscope until an agreement was reached.

Establishment of PAK6 overexpressing cell lines
To restore the expression of PAK6 in SW480
cells, human full length PAK6 cDNA was inserted into
the GV230 vector (Genechem Co. Ltd., Shanghai,
China), which was transduced into SW480 cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s advised procedure. The empty vector was
transduced into control cells. The PAK6 expressing and
control cells were designated SW480/PAK6 and SW480/
vector, respectively.

qPCR analysis was performed on all of the cell
lines and on the 40 frozen tumor tissue and corresponding
normal tissue specimens. Total RNA was extracted and
qPCR was performed as previously described [35].
qPCR analysis of PAK6 expression was conducted
using 2 μL of cDNA. The forward primer sequence was
5’ atctgggagagaaggcgaac 3’ and the antisense primer
sequence was 5’ ggaggacaaggagacagcag 3’. β-actin was
used as an internal control. All of the experiments were
performed at least in triplicates.

Cell lines and reagents
The human colon carcinoma cell lines HCT8,
HCT116 and SW480 were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and cultured at 37°C with
5% CO2. 5-FU was purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO,
USA).

Nude mice xenograft models

Western blotting was performed as previously
described [35]. Briefly, membranes were incubated
with primary antibodies targeting PAK6, cleaved PARP,
cleaved caspase 3, serine112 p-BAD, total BAD, or
β-actin overnight (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology,
USA). Following overnight incubation with the primary
antibody, membranes were washed 3 times in tris buffered
saline-Tween 20 (TBST) for 10 min each. The membranes
were then incubated with the secondary antibody in 5%
milk in TBST for 1 h. Following the secondary antibody
incubation, membranes were washed for 30 min, and the
targeted proteins were detected by chemiluminescence
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). β-Actin
levels were used as loading controls.

Colon cancer xenografts were established in 4-weekold male BALB/C nude mice purchased from the Institute
of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences of Shanghai.
Briefly, PAK6-KD and shNT cells (3 × 106) were
suspended in 100 μL of PBS and injected subcutaneously
into the flank of the 4-week-old nude mice. The tumor
volume was calculated using the formula: length × width2
× 0.5. When the tumor volumes were approximately
0.2 cm3, the mice were divided into 4 groups: shNT,
shNT plus 5-FU, shKD, and shKD plus 5-FU. 5-FU
was dissolved in PBS and 20 mg/kg/day was injected
intraperitoneal twice a week for 3 weeks. The tumor
volume and body weight of the mice were measured once
a week and the mice were sacrificed after 5 weeks. All of
the animal procedures were conducted in accordance with
the Shanghai Jiaotong University Affiliated Shanghai First
People’s Hospital Animal Care guidelines. All efforts were
made to minimize animal suffering.

Cell viability assay
To analyze the viability of cells treated with 5-FU
and with altered PAK6 expression, 1 × 104 cells/well were
seeded in 96-well plates containing 0.2 mL of medium.
After treatment, MTT (5 mg/mL, Sigma, USA) was added
to each well (including the control well) and the mixture
was incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The culture medium was
then replaced with an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide
(Sigma, USA). After shaking at room temperature for
10 min, the 490 nm absorbance (A490) of each well
was determined on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA).
Cell viability was calculated according to the following
formula: cell viability (%) = A490 (sample)/A490
(control) × 100.

Statistical analysis
The significance of the in vitro and in vivo data was
determined using the Student t test (2-tailed). The 2-tailed
χ2 test and Fisher exact test were used to determine the
statistical significance of the covariate differences.
Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier
method and the log-rank test was used to compare the
survival curves. The Cox proportional hazards model was
used to calculate multivariate HRs for the variables. A P
value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant. All statistical analyses were carried out using
the SPSS 19.0 statistical software package (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL).

Flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle and
apoptosis
The cell cycle was analyzed using the Cell Cycle
Kit (BD, CA, USA). Cells were trypsinized and washed
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min prior to
collection by centrifugation at 1500 revolutions per minute
(rpm). Cells were then fixed with 2 mL of prechilled 70%
ethanol for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were then gently
centrifuged and resuspended in a solution containing
RNase A and PI. After 30 min incubations, the cells
were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Accuri C6, USA).
For the apoptosis assay, the cells were trypsinized and
washed with serum-containing medium. Cells were then
centrifuged for 3 min at 1500 rpm and the supernatant
was discarded. The cells were resuspended in 1 × Binding
Buffer at 1–5 × 106/mL. The cells were then stained for
10–15 min at room temperature using the Annexin V-APC/
PI Apoptosis Kit (eBioscience, CA, USA) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. The number of
apoptotic cells was analyzed using flow cytometry (BD
