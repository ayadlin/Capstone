Abstract
Current understanding of the p53 response is based mainly upon in vitro studies of homogeneous cell
populations. However, there is little information on whether the same principles operate within heterogeneous tumor tissues that are comprised of cancer cells and other cell types, including cancer-associated
ﬁbroblasts (CAF). Using ex-vivo tissue cultures, we investigated p53 status and responses to cisplatin in tumor
cells and CAFs from tissue specimens isolated from 32 lung cancer patients. By comparing cultivated tissue
slices with the corresponding tumor tissues ﬁxed immediately after surgery, we found that morphology,
proliferation, and p53 staining pattern were preserved during cultivation. Unexpectedly, when CAFs were
analyzed, p53 accumulation and induction of p21 was observed only in tumors with constitutively low p53
protein and accumulation upon cisplatin treatment. In contrast, in tumors with no p53 accumulation in
cancer cells there was also no p53 accumulation or p21 induction in adjacent CAFs. Furthermore, induction
of cisplatin-induced apoptosis in CAFs was selectively observed in tumors characterized by a parallel
induction of cancer cell death. Our ﬁndings reveal an interdependence of the p53 response in cancer cells and
adjacent CAFs within tumor tissues, arguing that cancer cells control the response of their microenvironment
to DNA damage. Cancer Res; 72(22); 5824–32. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
One of the major molecular players in cellular stress
responses is the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Under nonstressed conditions, p53 is rapidly degraded and, therefore, not
present at detectable levels in the cell. Upon various types of
cellular stresses, p53 gets stabilized and rapidly accumulates
within the nucleus (1–3). The tight regulation of the p53 system
is impaired in most if not all cancers (4). More than 50% of all
tumors carry TP53 mutations (5, 6). In many of the remaining
cancers p53 is thought to be inactivated, for example, through
loss of upstream regulators such as ARF (7) or overexpression
of p53 inhibitors such as Mdm2 or MdmX (8).
The vast majority of research on p53 activities upon genotoxic stress has been conducted in homogeneous 2-dimensional (2D) cultures of tumor cell lines. However, in intact

tissues a variety of different cell types interact with each other
(9) and might thereby inﬂuence their respective reactions to
stress. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that
activation of p53 in 1 cell can inﬂuence the response of
neighboring cells, particularly via transcriptional activation of
genes that encode for secreted factors. For instance, in mouse
xenograft models as well as in cell culture experiments using
conditioned medium, it has been shown that the p53 activity of
stromal ﬁbroblasts can reduce growth and enhance apoptosis
of epithelial cancer cells (10, 11). Therefore, attenuation of the
p53 response of carcinoma-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAF)
should support tumor growth. Moreover, facilitating the survival of CAFs by diminishing p53 function under stressful
conditions might also help maintain a favorable environment
for tumor progression.
Although mutations within the TP53 gene locus in stromal
cells have been described (12, 13), their existence remains
controversial (14–16). Alternatively, cancer cell–derived
mechanisms might exist by which the malignant clone suppresses p53 function in the adjacent stromal cells. Indeed,
experiments using conditioned medium from epithelial cancer
cells indicated that such cells can antagonize this stromal
activity by silencing p53 activation in their adjacent ﬁbroblasts
upon DNA damage (17). Yet, to date no studies have examined
the inﬂuence of cancer cells on the p53 response of stromal
ﬁbroblasts within the intact tumor tissue.
In the present work, we analyzed p53 responses to cisplatin
in 32 primary lung carcinomas using our previously described
tissue slice technology (18). This culture system allowed us to
analyze different cellular components (cancer cells and CAFs)

Coordinate Regulation of p53 in Cancer Cells and CAFs

for their sensitivity as well as for their p53 response within an
intact tumor microenvironment. Remarkably, we found a close
correlation between p53 accumulation and activation in cancer cells and in their adjacent CAFs. These results strongly
suggest that, within the intact tumor microenvironment, the
p53 response of cancer cells and CAFs is coordinately regulated
via a cross-talk between these 2 cell types.

Material and Methods
Tissue slice preparation and culture
Fresh tumor tissue was obtained from Klinik Schillerh€
ohe
immediately after surgery of lung cancer patients. The local
ethics committee approved the investigation (project number 396/2005V) and informed consent was obtained from
the patients. After arrival, the fresh material was incubated
in Oncostore (Oncoscience AG) containing 100mg/mL Colistin until the start of the experiment to avoid bacterial
contamination of tissue slices. Cores with a diameter of
5 mm were punched out of the tissue by hand and slices of
200 mm thickness were prepared using a Krumdieck tissue
slicer (Krumdieck, Alabama Research and Development
Corp., Munsford). The slices were then put in 24-well plates
containing Airway Epithelial Cell Medium þ Supplements
(PromoCell) and incubation was conducted for 96 hours in
a constant atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 37 C. Treatment
with cisplatin (13 mmol/L) started 24 hours after preparation of slices for additional 72 hours. Cisplatin was obtained
from the pharmacy of Robert Bosch Hospital at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Fixation was done using buffered
formalin before slices were embedded in parafﬁn for further
investigation.
Isolation, cultivation, and characterization of
carcinoma-associated ﬁbroblasts
Tumor tissues from 6 patients were enzymatically digested
using a tissue disaggregation buffer (120 mmol/L NaCl, 5.6
mmol/L glucose, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2  6H20, 5.4 mmol/L KCl, 1
mmol/L NaH2PO4, 20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.2) supplemented
with collagenase (167 U/mL), DNase (250 U/mL), and protease
(0.25 mg/mL) for 90 minutes at 37 C. The disaggregated
material was ﬁltered through a 70-mm cell strainer (BD Falcon)
and the ﬂow-through was seeded in cell culture ﬂasks. The
outgrowing ﬁbroblasts were cultivated with RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS.
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemical analysis, the embedded slices
were cut into 3 mm sections. Staining for Ki67 (anti-human
Ki67 Antigen, Clone MIB-1, 1:50) was done using the DAKO
Envision Kit on a DakoCytomation Autostainer (DAKO).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) staining was done according to the
manufacturer's instructions (ApopTag Kit S7100, Chemicon). Staining for p21 (anti-p21 WAF1 Ab-3, clone DSC60.2, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and p53 (anti-p53 DM082,
clone DO-7, ACRIS) was done using the DAKO Envision Kit.
Before staining epitope, retrieval was achieved by incubating
at pH6 (DAKO target retrieval solution pH6) for 15 minutes

www.aacrjournals.org

in a steam heater. The p21 and p53 antibodies were diluted
1:50 and 1:40 respectively using DAKO antibody diluent.
Visualization was done with the Leica DM 4000 B microscope (Leica Microsystems). Immunohistochemical assessment was conducted blinded independently by at least 2
observers. For all stainings, the percentage of positive cells
was determined using the 20 and 40 objectives. Discrepancies were resolved by simultaneous examination using a
double-headed microscope.
Protein expression
For total lysates the cellular pellet was resuspended in lysis
buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH7.6, 250 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1%
Triton x-100, 5 mmol/L EDTA) supplemented with complete
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).Western blot was conducted using following antibodies: anti-p53 clones DO1 and
1801 (Santa Cruz) and anti-b-actin (Sigma).
DNA isolation
DNA isolation from parafﬁn embedded material was done
using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Parafﬁn
blocks of tumor tissues from patients were obtained from the
pathology of the Robert Bosch Hospital and cut into several 10
mmol/L slices. Areas of high tumor content were chosen for
DNA isolation as determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining of an additional sequential section.
Sequencing
Before sequencing DNA, the exons of interest had to be
ampliﬁed via PCR. The same primers were used for the PCR
and sequencing reaction. The current primers of International
Agency for Research on Cancer were used: Exon 4: P-329 and
P330, Exon 5: P-312 and P-271, Exon 6: P-239 and P- 240, Exon 7:
P-333 and P-313, Exon 8: P-316 and P-319, Exon 8–9: P-314 and
P-315, and Exon 10: P-E10Li and P-562. Afterward PCR products were sent to GENterprise (GENterprise) for sequencing.
Software
Statistics were conducted using GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software (Graph Pad Prism Software Imcorp). Pictures of immunohistochemical stainings were taken using the Leica Application Suite and the DFC 245 camera (both Leica Microsystems). Sequences were analyzed using Chromas Lite 1.62
(Technelysium Pty. Ltd.) and Geneious (Biomatters Ltd).
X54156_dna from p53-knowledgebase (http://p53.bii.a-star.
edu.sg/index.php) was used as reference sequence for p53.

Results
Morphology, proliferation, and p53 staining in tissue
slices from primary lung cancer specimens are
preserved during cultivation
To study the p53 response within an experimental setting
that is as similar as possible to the intact tumor tissue, we used
lung cancer tissue slices cultured ex vivo. Immediately after
surgery, tissue samples were sliced on a Krumdieck tissue slicer
at 200-mm-thick slices. Tissue slices from 35 primary lung
carcinomas were cultured for 96 hours, then ﬁxed in formalin,
and embedded in parafﬁn as described previously (16, 18).

Three cases were excluded because of distinct necrotic areas in
control tissues (more than 50%).
As a quality control we compared morphology, Ki67, and p53
immunostaining in cultivated tissue slices with the corresponding tumor tissue material ﬁxed immediately after surgery (pathological routine material). As shown in Fig. 1 (representative cases in left), morphology was highly preserved
during cultivation. In addition, the range of Ki67 scores
obtained from cultivated tissue samples signiﬁcantly correlated to that of the corresponding tissues ﬁxed immediately after
surgery (Fig. 1A, right) and was also comparable to Ki67 scores
described in non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patient
studies (19). As shown in the representative examples in Fig.
1B, p53 staining pattern was also preserved during cultivation.
Furthermore, there was a signiﬁcant correlation between the
percentage of p53-positive cancer cells in cultivated tissues
and in the corresponding pathological routine sections (Spearman correlation ¼ 0.82; P < 0.0001).
TP53 mutations were detected in 18 of the 32 cases (56.2%)
with 12 missense substitutions and 6 deletions. The overall
distribution of missense mutations was comparable to the
dataset for NSCLC published in the International Agency for
Research on Cancer TP53 database (http://www-p53.iarc.fr).
TP53 status and patient characteristics as well as medication
are summarized in the Supplementary Table S1. We found a
nonsigniﬁcant but slightly higher number of Ki67-positive
cancer cells in tumors harboring mutated p53 compared with
wtp53 tumors (Fig. 1C).

Characterization of tumors by p53 status and Ki67
expression
We next examined the p53 response of cancer cells to
cisplatin in their intact tissue microenvironment. For this, we
incubated tissue slices from 32 individual lung cancer patients
with or without cisplatin and analyzed them for p53 protein
expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC; Fig. 2A). According to their p53 immunostaining characteristics, the tumor
samples could be divided into 3 categories. In 14 of 32 cases
(43.7%), we found constitutively low (less than 20% of cancer
cells) or undetectable p53 levels in cancer cell nuclei in
untreated samples and an accumulation of p53 in the cancer
cells upon cisplatin treatment (Fig. 2A, category I). Cases with
constitutively high p53 levels in the cancer cell compartment
(more than 20% of cancer cells), with no further p53 accumulation after cisplatin treatment (7 of 32; 21.9%) were deﬁned as
category II tumors (Fig. 2A). In a third subgroup (11 of 32;
34.4%), p53 protein was completely undetectable in cancer cell
nuclei both without and with cisplatin treatment (Fig. 2A,
category III).
The Ki67 score of category I and II tumors was comparable.
A trend toward lower proliferation rate was detected in samples with undetectable p53 (category III tumors) regardless of
the presence of cisplatin (Fig. 2B).
In all tissues (7 of 7) from category II tumors, TP53 mutations could be detected (Fig. 2B; mutant p53 indicated by red
squares). This result was expected since, within established tumors, p53 proteins produced by missense mutations are often

Tumor tissue slices were incubated with or without cisplatin for 72 hours
and evaluated for p53 (with and without cisplatin; A) and Ki67
(constitutive; B). A, representative examples of control samples (left) and
cisplatin-treated samples (right). According to their p53 positivity in
cancer cells before and after cisplatin treatment, the samples were
subdivided into categories. The 3 categories were deﬁned as follows:
category I (top), no detectable or low constitutive expression of p53
(<20% of positive cancer cells) with accumulation after 72 hours of
cisplatin treatment; category II (middle), constitutively high p53 levels with
no further accumulation upon cisplatin treatment; and category III

excessively stable, owing to escape for the posttranslational
mechanisms that otherwise promote rapid p53 degradation
(20–22). However, TP53 mutations could also be detected in
many tumors characterized by low or undetectable p53 staining
in untreated control samples from categories I (7 of 14 with TP53
mutation; indicated by red squares in Fig. 2B) and III (4 of 11
with TP53 mutation; indicated by red squares in Fig. 2B).
Response of cancer cells to cisplatin treatment
Response to cisplatin treatment in the cancer cells was
evaluated by reduction of Ki67 score by at least 10% (Fig.
3A) and by an increase of at least 20% in TUNEL-positive cells
(Fig. 3B). Five of 13 tumors harboring wtp53 (38%) responded
to cisplatin by reduced proliferation. Of note, 4 of those 5
responders were category I tumors (Fig. 3A, top). Of the 17
tumors harboring mutant p53, 4 responded to cisplatin by
reduced proliferation (23.5%). Interestingly, only 1 of those 4
tumors was of category I, whereas the remaining 3 were of
category II, characterized by constitutively high p53 protein
staining (Fig. 3A, bottom).
Signiﬁcant induction of cell death in response to cisplatin
was observed in both wt and mutant p53 tumors. However, the
proportion of responders was higher in wtp53 tumors than in
those harboring mutant p53. The responders in tumors harboring wtp53 were distributed among category I and III (Fig.
3B, top). Among the 4 responder tumors with mutant p53, 3
were from category I tumors and only 1 from category II (Fig.
3B, bottom). Irrespective of the p53 mutation status, we found
a trend toward higher sensitivity of category I tumors to
cisplatin when compared with the other 2 tumor groups
indicating that the observed differences in p53 response might
also have functional consequences (Supplementary Figure).
The response of CAFs to cisplatin mirrors the response of
their adjacent cancer cells
We next investigated p53 protein expression in both CAFs
and their adjacent cancer cells within the intact tumor tissue
samples, using p53 IHC and hematoxylin counterstaining
(representative examples in Fig. 4A). In the absence of cisplatin,
p53 was undetectable or low (<2%) in CAFs irrespective of the
different p53 levels in cancer cells of the 3 tumor categories
(Supplementary Table S2). Remarkably, upon cisplatin treatment we observed a strong correlation between p53 accumulation in the cancer cells and p53 accumulation in their
adjacent CAFs (Spearman correlation ¼ 0.88; P < 0.0001).
Strikingly, in category I tumors this correlation was seen
regardless of the p53 mutation status of the tumor (Fig. 4B,
left), and was mirrored by parallel induction of the p53 target
p21 in CAFs (Fig. 4B, right). In sharp contrast, tumor tissues
with no detectable induction of p53 accumulation in the cancer

percentage of Ki67-positive cancer cells in the tumor categories I to III.
Thirty-one of 32 tumor samples were available for KI67 staining. TP53
mutation status is indicated by black (wild-type) and red squares
(mutant). Horizontal lines indicate the mean percentage of Ki67-positive
cancer cells within the 3 groups. Group III shows the lowest mean
expression of Ki67, whereas there is only a slight difference between the
groups I and II.

cells (categories II and III) showed no p53 accumulation
(Fig. 4B, left) or p21 induction (Fig. 4B, right) also in their
adjacent CAFs. To analyze if this phenotype is preserved in
CAFs after disruption of the tumor tissue context, we used
CAFs isolated from 2 tumors of each category and cultivated
them in presence or absence of cisplatin. Importantly, induction of p53 accumulation was detected in all monocultivated
CAF strains to a comparable degree irrespective of the tumor
category (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the microenvironment
predominantly determines the observed differences in the
p53 response of CAFs to cisplatin. These results show for the
ﬁrst time a close correlation in p53 response between cancer

lung tumor tissues.
TUNEL IHC was next used to analyze induction of cell death
upon cisplatin treatment of tissue slices (Fig. 4D). Cisplatininduced increase of TUNEL positivity was observed in both
the cancer cell and stromal cell compartments (Spearman
correlation ¼ 0.65; P ¼ 0.0003). Notably, in 7 of 26 cases, a
parallel increase of TUNEL positivity (above 20%) was observed
in both cancer and stromal cells. In contrast, in only 4 of 26
cases, we found an apoptotic response to cisplatin in the
cancer cell compartment but not in their adjacent CAFs. All
cases with a response in CAFs showed also a response in the

cancer cell compartment. Together, these ﬁndings argue that
not only p53 induction but also induction of cell death upon
cisplatin was markedly correlated between cancer and stromal
cells.

Discussion
Understanding the response of complex tumor tissues to
DNA damaging agents might facilitate the rational design of
therapeutic regimens to treat cancer. Serial biopsies to
study such stress responses in vivo are not feasible in
cancer patients. Both 2D and 3-dimensional cell culture
systems aim to mimic the tumor, but it is likely that the
heterogeneity of primary tumor samples surpasses by far
the complexity of even advanced in vitro culture systems.
Cultivation of thin tissue slices prepared from freshly
resected primary tumors is probably the only suitable ex
vivo model system that adequately represents the complexity and heterogeneity of the individual in situ situation of
carcinomas in patients (16, 18, 23). Using this ex vivo model,

we were able to show a close correlation of the stress
responses of cancer cells and the nonmalignant CAFs in
intact lung tumor tissues: both accumulation of the major
stress regulator p53 and induction of cell death were found
to be coordinately regulated in the cancer and stromal
compartments.
Our data show that constitutive expression of p53 protein
as well as its accumulation upon cisplatin in cancer cells
show a high degree of variability among individual tumors,
which could not be completely predicted on the basis of the
mutational status of TP53. In most clinical studies of NCSLC
patient specimens, positive staining for p53 tended to be
associated with the presence of TP53 mutations (for review
see ref. 24). This is consistent with our ﬁndings, as we
detected TP53 mutations in all tumors with constitutively
high p53 levels in the nuclei of the cancer cells (category II
tumors). However, we also found TP53 mutations in approximately 50% of tumors with constitutively low or undetectable p53 levels (category I and III tumors). Interestingly, in

Schmid et al.

the majority of those latter cases we observed a signiﬁcant
induction of nuclear p53 staining in the cancer cell compartment in response to cisplatin treatment (category I
tumors). The imperfect correlation of constitutive p53 IHC
positivity and TP53 mutation status in our relatively small
patient cohort has also been observed in other studies (25–
27). Furthermore, analysis of a p53R172H knock-in mouse
model conﬁrmed that mutant p53 is inherently unstable in
normal mouse tissues (28), and additional tumor speciﬁc
alterations, such as altered Mdm2 or ARF expression, are
required for stabilization of mutant p53 (22). Importantly, it
could be shown in vivo that, similar to wtp53, mutant p53
protein can also be posttranslationally modiﬁed and stabilized in response to cellular stress signals (29); this is in
agreement with our study where 7 of 10 mutant p53 tumor
samples with constitutively low p53 levels responded to
cisplatin by p53 accumulation.
Numerous studies have assessed a possible relationship
between p53 protein expression and therapy outcome, and
the ﬁndings have been inconsistent across those studies (for
review see ref. 24). However, most studies do support a trend
toward enhanced resistance to platinum-based therapy in
NSCLCs with p53 IHC positivity, even if this association did
not reach signiﬁcance in a meta-analysis involving more
than 1,000 NSCLC patients (30). In accordance with these
clinical studies, we found that the majority of tumors with a
constitutively high expression of p53 did not respond to
cisplatin by induction of cell death (category II tumors; Fig.
3). This is in contrast to cases with p53 accumulation
induced by cisplatin treatment (category I tumors), where
a signiﬁcant proportion showed an induction of cell death
independent of the TP53 mutation status of the tumor.
There are 2 possible explanations for this phenomenon.
First, the mutational status of the cancer cells in cultured
tissues might differ from that in the parafﬁn embedded
material used for sequencing in our study. However, a
previously published report shows that despite a high degree
of variability in p53 IHC, the genetic TP53 alterations were
homogeneously detectable in tissue sections of lung cancer
(31). Therefore, a discrepancy between the cancer cells in
cultured tissues and the corresponding primary tumor
material used for sequencing seems unlikely. An alternative
explanation might be that induction of cell death by cisplatin is independent of p53 in TP53 mutated tumors with
low constitutive p53 levels, despite the observed increase of
p53 protein (category I tumors; Fig. 3). The enhanced
resistance of p53-mutated tumors harboring constitutively
high levels of p53 protein might be because of the same
mechanisms that cause increased stability of the mutant p53
protein, namely cancer-associated alterations in intracellular signaling pathways that enable those cancer cells to
adapt to constitutive high stress.
Despite the high degree of variability in the reaction to
cisplatin, both induction of p53 accumulation as well as
induction of cell death was coordinately regulated in the
cancer cells and in their neighboring ﬁbroblasts. These data
further show the central role of the microenvironment for
the response of the whole tumor, including neoplastic cells

5830

as well as noncancerous stromal cells, to cytotoxic drugs.
Furthermore, despite a presumably normal p53 genotype
(16), CAF-speciﬁc induction of p53 and p21 occurred only in
tumor tissues characterized by induction of p53 accumulation in the cancer cell compartment (category I tumors)
whereas in tumors with no p53 accumulation in cancer cells
(categories II and III) there was also no p53 accumulation or
p21 induction in adjacent CAFs. Importantly, this phenotype
seems to be dependent on the intact tissue environment, as
isolated CAFs in 2D monoculture showed cisplatin-induced
p53 accumulation independent of the tumor category they
were originated from. So far, mutual cross-talk of the p53
responses of cancer cells and their microenvironment has
been studied only in artiﬁcial cocultures. In such models,
p53 activity of normal ﬁbroblasts was shown to negatively
inﬂuence cancer cell proliferation via paracrine mechanisms
(32, 33). Furthermore, cancer cell proliferation was
repressed in normal but not in p53 null mice (10). These
observations suggest that tumors harboring a p53-deﬁcient
microenvironment may have a selective advantage. Indeed,
using a prostate mouse model, Hill and colleagues showed
that stromal ﬁbroblasts tend to lose their wild type p53
during tumor progression (34). Moreover, TP53 mutations
resulting in amino acid substitutions have been detected in
microdissected stromal compartments from parafﬁnembedded carcinoma samples (12, 13), even though the
latter results were challenged by subsequent studies, using
frozen tissues or fresh material (14–16). Therefore, if CAFs
indeed typically maintain a wild type p53 genotype, a
functional interaction between cancer cells and the p53
response of CAFs seems to be more likely. Indeed, such
interactions could be shown in simple 2D cell line models
(17, 35), where it was shown that epithelial cancer cells can
suppress CAF-speciﬁc p53 accumulation. Our data provide
for the ﬁrst time evidence that this inhibitory effect of
cancer cells on CAF p53 response may depend on the
functionality of the cancer cell p53 response: complete
abrogation of cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation in CAFs
was selectively seen in tumor tissue samples characterized
by lack of p53 accumulation in the cancer cell compartment.
This implies that, independent of the mutational status of
TP53, loss of the DNA damage-induced p53 response in
cancer cells is sufﬁcient to inhibit stromal p53 induction.
We also observed a trend toward enhanced resistance to
cisplatin-induced cell death in such tumors (Supplementary
Figure), indicating that this inhibitory effect might also have
functional consequences. However, because of the very
heterogeneous treatment regimens (summarized in the
Supplementary Table S1) and the relatively small sample
size, statistically signiﬁcant correlation between p53 functionally or mutational status and clinical outcome could not
be obtained.
In sum, our ﬁndings highlight a hitherto undescribed level of
cross-talk between the p53 response in cancer cells and in their
immediate microenvironment, which is only partly accountable by p53 mutation status. Furthermore, they highlight the
great potential of tissue slices for studying cancer-stroma
interactions in a setting that is more representative of the
