Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

TRAIL induces apoptosis in cancer cells whilst sparing normal tissues. Despite promising preclinical results, few patients responded to treatment with recombinant TRAIL (Apo2L/
Dulanermin) or TRAIL-R2-specific antibodies, such as conatumumab (AMG655). It is unknown
whether this was due to intrinsic TRAIL resistance within primary human cancers or insufficient
agonistic activity of the TRAIL-R-targeting drugs. FcγR-mediated crosslinking increases the
cancer-cell-killing activity of TRAIL-R2-specific antibodies in vivo. We tested this phenomenon
using FcγR-expressing immune cells from patients with ovarian cancer. However, even in the
presence of high numbers of FcγR-expressing immune cells, as found in ovarian cancer ascites,
AMG655-induced apoptosis was not enabled to any significant degree, indicating that this concept
may not translate into clinical use. On the basis of these results we next set out to determine
whether AMG655 possibly interferes with apoptosis induction by endogenous TRAIL which
could be expressed by immune cells. To do so, we tested how AMG655 affected apoptosis
induction by recombinant TRAIL. This, however, resulted in the surprising discovery of a striking
synergy between AMG655 and non-tagged TRAIL (Apo2L/TRAIL) in killing cancer cells. This
combination was as effective in killing cancer cells as highly active recombinant isoleucinezipper-tagged TRAIL (iz-TRAIL). The increased killing efficiency was due to enhanced formation
of the TRAIL death-inducing signalling complex (DISC), enabled by concomitant binding of
Apo2L/TRAIL and AMG655 to TRAIL-R2. The synergy of AMG655 with Apo2L/TRAIL
extended to primary ovarian cancer cells and was further enhanced by combination with the

proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or a SMAC mimetic. Importantly, primary human hepatocytes
were not killed by the AMG655-Apo2L/TRAIL combination, also not when further combined
with bortezomib or a SMAC mimetic. We therefore propose that clinical-grade non-tagged
recombinant forms of TRAIL, such as dulanermin, could be combined with antibodies such as
AMG655 to introduce a highly active TRAIL-R2-agonistic therapy into the cancer clinic.

Introduction

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can kill tumour cells in vivo without
harming normal tissues (1, 2), a finding that initiated the clinical development of TRAILreceptor (TRAIL-R) agonists. Current TRAIL-R-agonistic drugs were developed during a
period of concern about their potential hepatotoxicity (3). Hence, in comparison to highly
active recombinant forms of TRAIL such as leucine-zipper- (1) or isoleucine-zipper-tagged
TRAIL (LZ-TRAIL or iz-TRAIL) (4), the clinically used recombinant non-tagged TRAIL
form, dulanermin (5), is a relatively weak agonist of TRAIL-R1 (also known as DR4) and
TRAIL-R2 (also known as DR5, Apo2, KILLER, TRICK2), the two death-domain (DD)containing TRAIL-Rs. In addition to its limited agonistic capacity, dulanermin has a short
in-vivo half-life (5), and, like other recombinant forms of TRAIL, binds to the nonapoptosis-inducing TRAIL-Rs, TRAIL-R3 (DcR1), TRAIL-R4 (DcR2) and Osteoprotegerin
(OPG), which may attenuate the pro-apoptotic activity exerted by its interaction with
TRAIL-R1 and/or TRAIL-R2. Consequently, agonistic antibodies to TRAIL-R1 and
TRAIL-R2 with a longer half-life and more restricted receptor specificity than recombinant
TRAIL were also developed for clinical use (6). However, despite encouraging preclinical
studies (2, 7) very few patients responded to either dulanermin (5, 8) or TRAIL-R1/2targeting antibodies (9-11) in clinical trials conducted thus far. This suggests that the current
clinical approaches of targeting TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 should be re-examined before
further studies are undertaken in patients.
Interestingly, Fcγ receptors (FcγR) on immune cells were recently shown to be capable of
crosslinking antibodies against DD-containing TRAIL-Rs which rendered these antibodies
active in killing cancer cells in vivo (12, 13). We therefore tested whether we could identify
conditions under which a clinically used TRAIL-R2-specific antibody, AMG655, which has
so far not shown any significant clinical activity, could be rendered active by exploiting this
phenomenon. Because the tumour microenvironment in ovarian cancer is rich in FcγRexpressing immune cells (14) and because TRAIL may serve as a treatment for ovarian
cancer (6, 15, 16), we set out to investigate whether FcγR-expressing immune cells in the
ovarian cancer microenvironment would enable AMG655-mediated killing of patientderived ovarian cancer cells. Surprisingly, these experiments led us to discover a previously
unrecognised synergy between AMG655 and TRAIL in killing primary ovarian cancer cells
specifically which, importantly, is independent of the presence of immune cells.

Results and Discussion
Treatment of primary ovarian cancer cells with bortezomib or SMAC mimetics enhances
apoptosis induction by iz-TRAIL

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We first used iz-TRAIL, a highly active recombinant form of TRAIL which we previously
developed for preclinical studies (4), to determine whether primary ovarian cancer cells
were TRAIL-sensitive or -resistant and whether proteasome inhibitors or SMAC mimetics
enhanced their sensitivity to TRAIL. We obtained primary ovarian cancer cells from
chemotherapy-resistant patients (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S1)
and found that whilst treatment with iz-TRAIL was capable of killing these cells, this was
only true for 38% of the cases (Figure 1a). Co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib/PS-341 (Figure 1b) or the SMAC mimetic compound SM083 (Figure 1c),
however, rendered these cells sensitive to iz-TRAIL-induced apoptosis in 52% and 66% of
the cases, respectively. These results confirm those obtained by others (15, 17), implying
that a highly active clinical TRAIL-R agonist could be used to treat ovarian cancer patients,
preferably in combination with a proteasome inhibitor or a SMAC mimetic compound.
Primary ascites-derived human CD45-positive cells are inefficient enablers of FcγRdependent TRAIL-R2-mediated apoptosis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Considering that FcγRs on immune cells were proposed to enable apoptosis induction by
TRAIL-R-targeting antibodies by crosslinking them, in conjunction with the fact that the
ovarian cancer microenvironment, especially in ascites, often contains high numbers of
FcγR-expressing immune cells, we reasoned that TRAIL-R2 antibodies might be an
effective treatment for ovarian cancer. We therefore tested the efficacy of the TRAIL-R2specific antibody AMG655 at killing ovarian cancer cells in the presence of ascites-derived
immune cells. We first confirmed the presence of different immune cell subsets and overall
FcγR expression on CD45-positive (CD45) immune cells isolated from ovarian cancer
ascites (Figure 2a). Myeloid cells (macrophages and neutrophils) were abundant in ovarian
cancer ascites and expressed high levels of CD16 (FcγRIIIA), CD32 (FcγRIIA), and CD64
(FcγRIA) (Figure 2b). NK cells were found in lower numbers in ovarian cancer ascites and
expressed CD16 (FcγRIIIA) (Supplemental Figure S2a).
To determine the efficiency of FcγR-mediated TRAIL-R2-antibody crosslinking by ascitesderived immune cells and a potential increase in agonistic activity achieved thereby, we
employed the highly TRAIL-sensitive PEO4 cell line. However, even at the highest ratio of
ten immune cells to one PEO4 cell, the level of AMG655-induced apoptosis was modest
(Figure 2c). The results from individual patients were divided into three groups, low
(<10%), medium (>10% and <25%), and high (>25%), dependent on the capacity of their
CD45+ FcγR-expressing cells to induce FcγR-dependent TRAIL-R2-mediated apoptosis of
PEO4 cells (Supplementary Figure S3). This allowed the determination of the relative
contribution of the different FcγRs and immune cell subsets towards AMG655-mediated
crosslinking of TRAIL-R2. Higher expression of FcγRIIIA (CD16) and FcγRIA (CD64)
expression and macrophages (within the 10 to 1 ratio treated group) were associated with
enhanced AMG655-mediated apoptosis (Figure 2d, e). Although a polymorphism at
FcγRIIA131H/H versus FcγRIIA131H/R was reported to enhance TRAIL-R2-mediated

apoptosis (12), the polymorphism frequencies were similar between different patient groups
(Supplementary Table S3). In summary, the efficiency of apoptosis induction by FcγRcrosslinked AMG655 never reached the levels achieved by iz-TRAIL or a non-tagged
recombinant form of TRAIL that we synthesised according to known dulanermin
specificities which is referred to as Apo2L/TRAIL herein (Figure 2c).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Thus, human FcγR-expressing immune cells were unable to enhance anti-TRAIL-R2induced apoptosis in primary ovarian cancer cells to any significant level (Figure 2f). Yet,
Apo2L/TRAIL and, even more potently, iz-TRAIL were capable of inducing apoptosis in
primary ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that recombinant forms of TRAIL are more
effective at multimerising TRAIL-R1 and/or TRAIL-R2 and, consequently, at inducing
apoptosis than the TRAIL-R2-specific antibody AMG655 in these cancer cells. Although
these are in-vitro studies, the ratio of immune to cancer cells that was sufficient to drive
FcγR-dependent TRAIL-R2-mediated apoptosis was substantially higher than the most
favourable ratios we found in solid deposits of ovarian cancer (Supplementary Figure S4).
We therefore conclude that the concept of enabling TRAIL-R2-mediated apoptosis in cancer
cells via FcγR-expressing human immune cells is most likely not viable for the majority of
cancers.
AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL synergise to potently kill ovarian cancer cells via TRAIL-R2

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Based on these results, we hypothesized that the binding of AMG655 to TRAIL-R2 might
interfere with the binding of endogenous TRAIL to TRAIL-R2. If true, AMG655 treatment
might even be counterproductive by preventing the killing of cancer cells by endogenous
TRAIL (18). Unexpectedly however, when testing this hypothesis, we found that AMG655
did not block, but instead profoundly enhanced the capacity of Apo2L/TRAIL to induce
apoptosis in cancer cells. Together, AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL were as active in killing
ovarian cancer cells as iz-TRAIL (Figure 3a). AMG655 enhanced Apo2L/TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines treated with or
without SMAC mimetics (Figure 3a). The activity of iz-TRAIL was not inhibited but, in
contrast to Apo2L/TRAIL, also not increased by AMG655 (Figure 3b). This suggests that
there is most likely a maximum proapoptotic agonistic activity that is achievable by TRAILR-crosslinking which is reached by both iz-TRAIL alone and the combination of Apo2L/
TRAIL with AMG655. The synergism between AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL was observed
at concentrations of AMG655 as low as 100 ng/ml (Figure 3c), which is more than two
orders of magnitude below the levels achieved in patients (5, 19). Importantly, the TRAILR2-specific antibody AMG655 we employed here has been used clinically and the nontagged Apo2L/TRAIL form we employed mimics dulanermin which has also already been
tested in clinical trials (2, 4). Hence, this combination represents a highly active TRAIL-R2agonistic therapy that could be suitable for immediate use in patients.
Intriguingly, the synergy of AMG655 with Apo2L/TRAIL in killing cancer cells was unique
amongst three different TRAIL-R1/2-specific antibodies we tested (Figure 3d), indicating
that not all TRAIL-R2-specific antibodies synergise with Apo2L/TRAIL to kill cancer cells.
When examining the molecular basis for this specificity, we found that Apo2L/TRAIL
significantly reduced the binding of HS201, but not of AMG655, to TRAIL-R2 (Figure 3e).

Thus, Apo2L/TRAIL and HS201 appear to bind TRAIL-R2 at overlapping epitopes, thereby
preventing these two proteins from acting in synergy. AMG655 instead binds TRAIL-R2 at
an epitope that does not interfere with the receptor’s concomitant interaction with Apo2L/
TRAIL so that both proteins can bind TRAIL-R2 simultaneously, resulting in enhanced
TRAIL-R2 crosslinking and apoptosis-inducing capacity. In line with this, the combination
of Apo2L/TRAIL with AMG655, but not with HS201, was able to trigger effective DISCmediated caspase-8 activation with subsequent Bid cleavage (Figure 3f). We hypothesised
that the effect of AMG655 on Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis could be mediated by
concomitant binding to TRAIL-R2 which would lead to enhanced multimerisation of
TRAIL-R2 and, consequently, increased formation of the TRAIL death-inducing signalling
complex (DISC) (20). In line with this hypothesis, AMG655 significantly enhanced Apo2L/
TRAIL-mediated recruitment of FADD, Caspase-8 and cFLIP and, hence, TRAIL DISC
formation (Figure 3g). This indicates that the synergistic apoptosis-inducing activity of
AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL is due to increased TRAIL DISC formation as a consequence
of enhanced TRAIL-R2 crosslinking. Furthermore, synergistic cell death induction by
AMG655-Apo2L/TRAIL was blocked by caspase inhibition (Figure 3h) but not by
inhibition of JNK (21) (Supplementary Figure S6), indicating that the AMG655-Apo2L/
TRAIL combination induces apoptotic cell death (2).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

It was recently shown that some TRAIL-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines require activation
of the mitochondrial pathway for TRAIL-induced apoptosis (21). We therefore next
investigated whether the synergistic effect of AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL requires
activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by using a genetically defined system of
isogenic HCT-116 colon carcinoma cell lines which are either wild-type (HCT116-WT) or
deficient for Bax and Bak (HCT116-Bax/Bak-dko) (Supplementary Figure S7a). HCT116WT and HCT116-Bax/Bak-dko cells both expressed similar levels of TRAIL-R1 and
TRAIL-R2 on their surface (Supplementary Figure S7b). Whereas HCT116-WT cells were
sensitive to AMG655-Apo2L/TRAIL, HCT116-Bax/Bak-dko cells were resistant
(Supplementary Figure S7c), indicating that the AMG655-Apo2L/TRAIL combination
cannot overcome resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis that is due to a block in the
apoptosis pathway at the mitochondrial level. However, addition of bortezomib re-sensitised
HCT116-Bax/Bak-dko cells to AMG655-Apo2L/TRAIL (Supplementary Figure S7c),
indicating that the mitochondrial block to the novel TRAIL-R-agonist combination can be
overcome by bortezomib, as previously shown for other TRAIL-R agonists (22).
We next investigated whether the synergy between AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL was
mediated solely by TRAIL-R2 or whether there was a contribution of TRAIL-R1. To do so,
we performed transient knockdowns of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 since these were both
expressed on PEO4 cells (Supplementary Figure S8a). We found that suppression of
TRAIL-R2 completely reversed the synergistic effect of AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL
treatment on cell death (Supplementary Figure S8, b and c), whereas TRAIL-R1 knockdown
only resulted in a minor reduction which was most likely attributable to co-suppression of
TRAIL-R2 by TRAIL-R1 knockdown (Supplementary Figure S8b and c). These data show
that the synergy of AMG655 with Apo2L/TRAIL in inducing apoptosis depends on TRAILR2.

AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL synergise to kill primary ovarian cancer cells but not primary
human hepatocytes

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We next investigated whether AMG655 could also synergise with Apo2L/TRAIL in killing
primary ovarian cancer cells. Indeed, the combination of AMG655 with Apo2L/TRAIL was
as active as iz-TRAIL in killing primary ovarian cancer cells (Figure 4a). When used in
combination with SM083, we observed that the AMG655-Apo2L/TRAIL combination was
again as active as iz-TRAIL when combined with SM083 in killing primary ovarian cancer
cells (Figure 4b). Thus, the combination of Apo2L/TRAIL with AMG655 can kill patientderived primary ovarian cancer cells, and further combination with a SMAC mimetic drug,
and/or possibly other TRAIL-sensitising agents, may hold great therapeutic promise for
ovarian cancer.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

In mice, highly active forms of TRAIL and SMAC mimetic compounds can be combined
without causing overt toxicity (23, 24). Given that AMG655 binds to human TRAIL-R2 but
not to the only murine DD-containing TRAIL-R (mTRAIL-R/mDR5), the potential
toxicities of therapeutic combinations of AMG655 cannot be evaluated in mouse models.
Also, such xenograft models (2, 7) are not predictive of the potential clinical efficacy of
AMG655 and dulanermin. Because of these considerations and previous concerns regarding
the potential liver toxicity of TRAIL (3, 4, 25, 26), we next examined whether primary
human hepatocytes were sensitive to apoptosis induction by the AMG655-Apo2L/TRAIL
combination, either alone or in the presence of SM083 or bortezomib. As control we used
CD95L, a potent killer of primary human hepatocytes (4). We found that treatment with the
combination of Apo2L/TRAIL and AMG655 did not induce any significant changes in
cellular morphology (Figure 4c), loss of cell viability (Figure 4d), or increase in the death of
primary human hepatocytes (Figure 4e). None of the AMG655- and Apo2L/TRAILcomprising treatments resulted in a significant increase in liver enzyme production (Figure
4f). These results are in line with our previous findings regarding the effects of highly active
recombinant forms of TRAIL on primary human hepatocytes (4). Importantly, also further
combination with SM083 or bortezomib did not induce a significant decrease in the viability
of primary human hepatocytes (Figure 4d). Thus, combining AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL,
with or without SM083 or bortezomib, does not kill primary human hepatocytes.
Taken together, on the basis of our findings we propose that it should be possible to
overcome the limited efficacy of currently clinically employed TRAIL-R agonists, in a
cancer-cell-specific manner, either by combining two of them, AMG655 and dulanermin, or
by employing single-agent highly active forms of recombinant TRAIL (1, 4, 27), possibly in
combination with SMAC mimetics, proteasome inhibitors or other potent TRAIL apoptosis
sensitisers (28). We anticipate that our findings will contribute to the introduction of a
highly active TRAIL-R-agonistic therapy into the cancer clinic.

Treatment of primary ovarian cancer cells with bortezomib or SMAC mimetics leads to
enhanced iz-TRAIL-induced cell death. Primary ovarian cancer cells were isolated from 18
patients with advanced ovarian cancer (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure
S1). (a) Primary ovarian cancer cells were cultured in 50% RPMI and 50% ascites which
was 0.22 μm sterile filtered and supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin/gentamycin/
glutamine at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and subsequently treated with izTRAIL [100 ng/ml] in the absence or presence of bortezomib/PS-341 [20 nM] (Selleck
Chemicals) (b), or the SMAC mimetic SM083 [100 nM] (29) (c). Cell viability was
measured after 48 hours using the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega, Southampton, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data represent
the mean of 3 biological replicates (± S.D.) using cells from each donor.

Primary ascites-derived human CD45-positive cells are inefficient enablers of FcγRdependent TRAIL-R2-mediated apoptosis. (a) Flow-cytometric analysis (FACS) of
FcγRIIIA (CD16), FcγRIIA (CD32) and FcγRIA (CD64) on the surface of CD45-positive
immune cells obtained from ascites of 11 patients with ovarian cancer. Flow cytometry was
performed on a BD FACSCalibur and analysed using FlowJo software from Tree star. FcγR
expression was determined by staining cells for CD45, CD16, CD32, and CD64; B-cells
were identified via CD45, CD3, CD19; macrophages via CD45, CD68, CD14; T-cells via
CD45 and CD3; NK cells via CD45, CD16, CD56; neutrophils via CD45, CD66. All
antibodies were purchased from BioLegend, (London, UK). (b) A forward and side scatter
gate was used to identify macrophages (CD45, CD68, CD14) and neutrophils (CD45, CD66)
within ovarian cancer ascites (Supplementary Figure S2). FcγR expression was determined
by staining cells for CD45 and CD16, CD32, and CD64. (c) Ascites-derived primary human
CD45 immune cells were co-cultured with PEO4 cells and treated with AMG655 [500 ng/
ml], AMG655 and recombinant protein A/G, Apo2L/TRAIL [500 ng/ml], or iz-TRAIL [500
ng/ml]. Primary CD45 cells were co-cultured with PEO4 cells in RPMI supplemented with
10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/gentamycin/glutamine. Tumour-cell-specific
death was quantified from a mixed population of tumour and immune cells 24 hours after
TRAIL treatment and determined by detection of cleaved CK18 (M30 CytoDeath, Peviva,
Bromma, Sweden), a specific marker of epithelial cell death by FACS. Data shown are mean
(± S.D.) of 11 independent experiments using CD45 cells from 11 patients. (d) The relative
expression of CD16, CD32 and CD64 on immune cells between patients with low (<10%),

Differences between the immune cell profiles of patients with low, intermediate, and high
enablers of FcγR-dependent AMG655-induced apoptosis (within the 10:1 ratio-treated

Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (n.s = p>0.05,
*=p<0.05, **=p<0.01, ***=p<0.001). (f) Primary ovarian cancer cells were cultured with

patient-derived immune cells that had been determined to be capable of enabling AMG655induced apoptosis in PEO4 cells (Supplementary Figure S5), at a ratio of 10 immune cells to
1 ovarian cancer cell, in the absence or presence of AMG655 [500 ng/ml], AMG655 and
protein A/G, Apo2L/TRAIL [500 ng/ml], or iz-TRAIL [500 ng/ml]. Specific death of cancer
cells was determined flow-cytometrically after 24 hours by release of cleaved cytokeratin
18. Primary CD45 cells and EpCAM+ cells were cultured in 50% RPMI and 50% ascites
which was 0.22 μm sterile filtered and supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin/
gentamycin/glutamine at 37°C in humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Data are
representative of 2 independent experiments performed using cells from the same patient
and experiments performed using samples from other patients.

AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL synergise to potently kill ovarian cancer cells via TRAIL-R2.
(a) All ovarian cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% Foetal
Calf Serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. SMOV2, PEA1, and PEA2
cells were treated with AMG655 and recombinant protein A/G, Apo2L/TRAIL, iz-TRAIL,
or AMG655 [10 μg/ml] and Apo2L/TRAIL with (right panel) and without (left panel)
SM083 at the indicated concentrations. Cell viability was measured after 24 hours using the
CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. (n=3 ± S.D.). The production and purification of iz-TRAIL was
as described previously (4). Production and purification of Apo2L/TRAIL was performed as
previously described by Ashkenazi et al. (2). (b) PEO4 cells were pre-incubated in the
absence or presence of AMG655 [10 μg/ml] for 1 hour and then treated with Apo2L/TRAIL
or iz-TRAIL at increasing concentrations. Cell viability was measured after 24 hours (n=5 ±
S.D.). (c) PEO4 cells were treated with Apo2L/TRAIL [10 ng/ml] and increasing
concentrations of AMG655. Cell viability was measured after 24 hours. (d) PEO4 cells were
pre-treated with or without different TRAIL-R1- or TRAIL-R2-specific antibodies [10 μg/
ml], and then treated with Apo2L/TRAIL [10 ng/ml]. The TRAIL-R1- and -R2-specific
antibodies HS101 and HS201 are available from AdipoGen. (e) PEO4 cells were incubated
with Apo2L/TRAIL [1 μg/ml] for 1 hour on ice, and then were washed 3 times, and
incubated with HS201 [10 μg/ml] or AMG655 [10 μg/ml] or isotype control for 1 hour on
ice. The cells were washed, and the binding of HS201 and AMG655 to TRAIL-R2 was
determined by flow cytometry. (f) PEO4 cells were stimulated with control Apo2L/TRAIL
[1 μg/ml], AMG-655 [10 μg/ml], AMG-655 [10 μg/ml] + Apo2L/TRAIL [1 μg/ml], HS201
[10 μg/ml], or HS201 [10 μg/ml] + Apo2L/TRAIL [1 μg/ml]. After 14 hours the cells were
lysed, and equal amounts of proteins from lysates, as determined by the bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) protein assay (Pierce), were separated by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE) on 4-12% Bis-TrisNuPAGE gels under reducing conditions (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia). Membranes were subjected to
immunoprobing with antibodies against caspase-8 (clone C15, Enzo, Exeter, UK), Bid

(R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), caspase-3 (R&D Systems) and β-actin (Sigma, Gillingham,
UK). Proteins were visualised using the Western Lightning® Plus-ECL, Enhanced
Chemiluminescence Substrate ECL Western Blotting Detection Plus (GE Healthcare). (g)
PEO4 cells were treated with either AMG655 [10 μg/ml], Apo2L/TRAIL [100 ng/ml], or
Apo2L/TRAIL and AMG655 for 1 hour and then lysed. Either AMG655 [10 μg/ml] or
Apo2L/TRAIL [100 ng/ml] was added to the lysates of cells stimulated in the absence of the
respective substance before immunoprecipitation of TRAIL-R2 to ensure the observed
changes in the TRAIL-R2 DISC were dependent on TRAIL-R2 stimulation (IP,
immunoprecipitation. Protein concentrations of each lysate were determined as above.
TRAIL-R2 was immunoprecipitated via AMG655, which was added to lysates if not used
for stimulation, and uncoupled Protein G Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The beads were then
washed and proteins were eluted from the beads with LDS buffer (NuPAGE, Invitrogen)
containing DTT. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as above and analysed by Western
blotting as above. Membranes were subjected to immunoprobing with antibodies against
TRAIL-R2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), FADD (clone 1F7, Enzo), cFLIP (clone
NF6, is available from Enzo) and Caspase-8 (clone C15, Enzo). *, unspecific bands

(h) PEO4 cells were treated for one hour with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk [20 μM]
and subsequently with Apo2L/TRAIL [100 ng/ml], AMG655 [10 μg/ml] and Apo2L/TRAIL
[100 ng/ml], AMG655 [10 μg/ml], or AMG655 and protein A/G. Cell viability was
measured after 24 hours.

AMG655 and Apo2L/TRAIL synergise to kill primary ovarian cancer cells but not primary
human hepatocytes (PHH). (a) Primary EpCAM+ ovarian cancer cells, isolated from 6
patients with advanced ovarian cancer, were treated with iz-TRAIL, AMG655 and
recombinant protein A/G (A/G), Apo2L/TRAIL, or Apo2L/TRAIL and AMG655 [10 μg/
ml], either alone (a) or in the presence of SM083 [100 nM] (b). Cell viability was measured
after 48 hours (n = 6 ± S.D for (a) and n = 6 ± S.D. for (b). Data were analysed using
GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software) and two way ANOVA (non-significant
(n.s) = p> 0.05, *=p<0.05, **=p<0.01, ***=p<0.001). Individual patient data are shown in
Supplementary Figure S9. (c) PHH from 3 donors and PHH culture reagents were purchased
from GIBCO® Life technologies. After thawing, the PHH were seeded as per the
manufacturer’s recommendations and cultured in hepatocyte maintenance medium for 3
days. PHH were then treated with Apo2L/TRAIL [10 μg/ml] and AMG655 [10 μg/ml] with
or without SM083 [100 nM] or bortezomib/PS-341 [20 nM]. Fc-CD95L [1 μg/ml] was used
as a positive control. Fc-CD95L was produced and purified from HEK293T supernatant as
previously described (4). (c) Phase contrast microscopy (10 × original magnification) of
treated PHH from a representative donor (donor 3). (d) Viability of PHH was assessed 24
hours after the onset of treatment as in (a) (n=3 ± S.D.) using the CellTiter-Glo®
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
(e) PHH death was determined 24 hours after onset of treatment as in (a) by measuring
release of soluble keratin 18 (K18) using the M65® ELISA (Peviva) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (n=3 ± S.D.). (f) Presence of the liver enzyme AST in PHH
culture supernatants was measured 24 hours after onset of treatment. Release of intracellular
hepatocyte-specific AST liver enzymes was measured using the Reflovet plus instrument
