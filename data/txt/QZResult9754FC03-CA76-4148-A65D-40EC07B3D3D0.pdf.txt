Abstract
Estrogen-induced Syrian hamster tumors in the kidney
represent a useful model to gain insight into the role of
estrogens in oncogenic processes. We provided evidence that
early tumor foci in the kidney arise from interstitial ectopic
uterine-like germinal stem cells, and that early tumor foci and
well-established tumors are highly aneuploid (92–94%). The
molecular mechanisms whereby estrogens mediate this
process are unclear. Here, we report that estrogen treatment
induced significant increases in Aurora A protein expression
(8.7-fold), activity (2.6-fold), mRNA (6.0-fold), and Aurora B
protein expression (4.6-fold) in tumors, compared with agematched cholesterol-treated kidneys. Immunohistochemistry
revealed that this increase in Aurora A and B protein
expression was essentially confined to cells within early and
large tumor foci at 3.5 and 6 months of estrogen treatment,
respectively. Upon estrogen withdrawal or coadministration of
tamoxifen for 10 days, a 78% to 79% and 81% to 64% reduction
in Aurora A and B expression, respectively, were observed in
primary tumors compared with tumors continuously exposed
to estrogens. These data indicate that overexpressed Aurora A
and B in these tumors are under estrogen control via estrogen
receptor A. Aurora A coenriched with the centrosome fraction
isolated from tumors in the kidney. Centrosome amplification
(number and area/cell) was detected in early tumor foci and
large tumors but not in adjacent uninvolved or age-matched
control kidneys. Taken together, these data indicate that
persistent overexpression of Aurora A and B is under estrogen
control, and is coincident with centrosome amplification,
chromosomal instability, and aneuploidy, and represent an
important mechanism driving tumorigenesis. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Estrogen-induced Syrian hamster tumors of the kidney have
been intensively studied in an effort to gain a better understanding
of the role of estrogenic hormones in oncogenic processes (1–4).
Importantly, 100% tumor incidence is achieved in animals with a
relatively modest elevation in serum estradiol-17h (E2) concen-

trations (f2.3 F 0.4 nmol/L/mL) and very low E2 concentrations
in renal tissue (4.6 pg/mg protein; ref. 5). These E2 levels are
comparable with those reported in human breast tissue in cycling
women (f5.2–5.8 pg/mg protein; refs. 6, 7).
These E2-elicited tumors arise in the kidney from ectopic
uterine-like germinal stem cells found in the interstitium and
primarily located in the corticomedullary region, the earliest region
in kidney development (8–10). Moreover, complimentary cytogenetic techniques have clearly shown that both E2-induced early
tumorous lesions and primary tumors of the kidney are highly
aneuploid (92–94%; refs. 8, 11). They occur coincident with, and
may be downstream consequences of c-myc/MYC overexpression,
c-myc amplification, and deregulation of the cell cycle; i.e.,
overexpressed cyclins D1, E, cdk2 and cdk4, and MDM2 driven
by estrogen receptor a (ERa; refs. 12, 13). However, it is presently
unclear how E2-induced deregulation of c-myc and cell cycle
entities result in large-scale genomic instability and tumorigenesis.
Recently, it has been proposed that the elevated expression of
mitotic kinases, especially Aurora A and B, are crucial events in the
cascade leading to centrosome amplification, chromosomal
instability, and aneuploidy, thus, driving oncogenesis (14, 15). The
Aurora family of serine/threonine kinases is essential for the
orderly progression of mitosis (16, 17). Aurora A, the most
intensively studied mitotic kinase, localizes to centrosomes, has a
critical role in regulating centrosome duplication, maturation, and
separation, spindle assembly and stability, as well as chromosome
condensation, segregation, and cytokinesis (14–17). Importantly,
Aurora A overexpression has been shown to elicit neoplastic
transformation in mammalian cells, both in vivo and in vitro
(18–20), thus behaving as a bona fide oncogene. It is noteworthy
that Aurora kinase (A/B) expression is nominal in resting cells and
transiently detectable in normal proliferating cells (21, 22). The
levels of Aurora B mRNA and protein expression, like those of
Aurora A, peak at G2-M phase, and their maximum kinase activity
is attained at the transition from metaphase to the completion of
mitosis (14, 16). Present evidence indicates that Aurora B,
considered a passenger protein, targets the centromere at
metaphase to phosphorylate histone H3, regulates proper chromosome segregation, and translocates the inner centromere
protein (INCENP) and possibly survivin to the spindle mid-zone
required for the regulation of cytokinesis. Thus, Aurora B is a key
regulator of accurate chromosome segregation via the control of
microtubule-kinetochore attachment and cytokinesis (16, 23–25).
In the current study, we show for the first time a concerted and
sustained overexpression of both Aurora A and B and coincident
centrosome amplification in solely E2-induced early tumorous foci

Aurora A and B from Syrian hamster
kidneys treated with cholesterol (C ), E2 for
3 (E3 ), 4 (E4 ), 5 (E5 ), or 6 (E6 ) months, and
E2-induced kidney tumors (T1 and T2 ;
n = 6). The expression of Aurora A was
generally consistent in samples from
cholesterol-treated control and early
E2-treated kidney samples. After 6 months
of E2 treatment, there was a slight increase
in Aurora A expression followed by a
marked increase in E2-induced tumors. The
tumor samples displayed the presence of a
doublet, which may represent the native
and phosphorylated forms of Aurora A.
Aurora B expression was detected
only in E2-induced tumor samples.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

continuously treated with E2 (T1 and T2 ),
10-day withdrawal of E2 (T E), and 10-day

and in large, well-established tumors in the hamster kidney. These
findings further support the concept that E2-mediated oncogenesis
occurs by a common pathway via sustained Aurora kinase
overexpression, which in turn, generates amplified centrosomes,
chromosomal instability, aneuploidy, and tumor formation.

Materials and Methods
Animals. Adult castrated male Syrian golden hamsters (LAK/LVG),
outbred strain, weighing 90 to 100 g were purchased from Harlan SpragueDawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Hamsters were housed in facilities certified
by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care. They were acclimated for at least 1 week prior to use, maintained on a
12-h light/12-h dark cycle, fed certified rodent chow (Ralston-Purina 5002),
and tap water ad libitum. The animal studies were carried out in adherence
to the guidelines established in the ‘‘Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals,’’ U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources
(NIH 1985). Hamsters in the treatment groups were implanted s.c. with
20 mg E2 pellets as described previously (26). Age-matched control animals
were implanted with 20 mg pellets of cholesterol. To maintain constant
levels, new pellets were implanted every 3 months. Their mean daily
absorption was 96 F 4 Ag/d. The pellets were prepared by Hormone Pellet
Press (Shawnee Mission, KS). Over a 6-month period of E2 treatment, the
average E2 concentration in serum was 2.28 F 0.43 ng/mL, and 4.57 F 1.04

pg/mg protein in the kidney (5). Groups of five to eight castrated
cholesterol-treated and E2-treated hamsters were used for 3 to 8 months in
most of the studies described. For the withdrawal studies, hamsters bearing
tumors treated for 6 months with two 20-mg pellets of E2, were divided into
four groups (n = 3): animals in group 1 were maintained on E2 pellets; group
2 had their two pellets removed; and those in group 3 had the initial E2
pellet removed, whereas the second one remained and were additionally
implanted with two pellets of 20 mg tamoxifen citrate; group 4 included
age-matched cholesterol-treated controls. All animals were killed 10 days
after the removal of the E2 pellets and tamoxifen citrate treatment. Tumors
were individually harvested from groups 1 to 3 (and kidneys from group 4)
for subsequent analysis of Aurora A expression and centrosome amplification.
Western blot. Kidneys and tumors were homogenized in lysis buffer
containing 50 mmol/L of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 mol/L of NaCl, 2 mmol/L of
EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 50 mmol/L of NaF, 0.5 mmol/L of Na3VO4, 20 mmol/L
of Na-pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Ag/mL
of aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL of leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L of DTT. The supernatant
fractions were collected and their protein content determined with
bicinchoninic acid reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Proteins were separated
by gel electrophoresis on PAGEr Gold Precast Gels (Cambrex Bio Science
Rockland, Inc., Rockland, ME) and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. Primary antibodies against Aurora A BL656 (1:1,000; Bethyl

Centrin MCI (1:25,000; Salisbury, JL, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), and gtubulin MMR58 (1:10,000; Salisbury, JL), were incubated overnight at 4jC.
Appropriate secondary antibodies were incubated for 2 h and protein
expression was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Densitometry was done using Alpha Imager
2000 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).
In vitro protein kinase assay. Proteins were extracted as described for
Western blotting. Aliquots, 200 Ag of total protein extracts, were incubated for
2 h at room temperature with 1 Ag of Aurora A BL469 (Bethyl Labs) followed
by a 2-h incubation with 30 AL of A/G agarose slurry. Normal IgG was used as
a negative control. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed several
times with PBS and immediately used for kinase assays (Upstate, Inc.,
Charlottesville, VA) following the manufacturer’s standard protocol with
modifications. Immunoprecipitates were incubated for 30 min at 30jC with
5 reaction buffer [40 mmol/L MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mmol/L EDTA], 10 ACi/AL of
[32P]gATP (Amersham Biosciences) diluted in Upstate Mg/ATP cocktail.
Reactions were spotted onto P81 paper, subjected to a series of washes in
0.75% phosphoric acid and acetone, and counts per minute measured using a
scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).
Reverse transcriptase PCR and real-time PCR. All reagents for reverse
transcriptase and real-time PCR were purchased from Invitrogen Corp.,
Carlsbad, CA. Total RNA was extracted using the protocol supplied by Life
Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD) for Trizol Reagent. Aliquots, f100 mg of
hamster kidney tissue and E2-induced primary tumors were immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverized while still frozen. The pulverized
tissue was then placed into 3 mL of Trizol and homogenized using a
Polytron. All samples were centrifuged at 12,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. The
supernatant was then transferred to a fresh tube and incubated at room
temperature for 5 min before adding 0.2 mL of chloroform/1 mL of Trizol.
The tubes were capped, shaken vigorously, and incubated for 3 min at room
temperature. The tubes were centrifuged at 12,000  g for 15 min at 4jC.
Total RNA was then precipitated with 0.5 mL of isopropanol/1 mL of Trizol.
The tubes were incubated at 80jC for 30 min and then centrifuged at

12,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. The RNA pellet was washed in 1 mL of 75%
ethanol/diethyl pyrocarbonate and centrifuged at 7,500  g for 5 min at
4jC. After briefly drying, the pellet was resuspended in 100 AL of diethyl
pyrocarbonate water and stored at 80jC. RNA integrity was evaluated by
agarose gel electrophoresis and the concentration of the RNA was
determined by spectrometry.
Reverse transcription was done using 5 Ag of total RNA/5 AL. The RNA
was combined with 250 ng of random primers, 10 mmol/L of deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix, and sterile distilled water. This mixture was heated at
65jC for 5 min and quick-chilled on ice. 5 first strand buffer, 0.1 mol/L of
DTT, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was added
to each sample and the reverse transcription reaction was done using an
iCycler thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The thermocycling protocol consisted of 1 h incubation at 37jC followed by 10 min
incubation at 96jC. The samples were stored at 4jC until used for PCR
analysis.
The cDNA synthesized during the reverse transcription reaction was
used to perform the real-time PCR reaction. cDNA was amplified using the
Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG and gene-specific primers for
h-actin (FWD 5-CAGCCGAGAGGGAAATTGTG-3¶; REV 5-TCGTTGCCAATGGTGATGAC-3¶; 101 bp amplicon) and Aurora A (FWD 5-TGGGTGTGTGCCTCGAAA; REV 5-GATTGAAGGCCGGATGCA; 102 bp amplicon) in a 7300
Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Myc gene

baseline was set automatically, as was the threshold Ct value measured
during the exponential phase of the amplification. The thermocycling
protocol consisted of 2 min incubation at 50jC followed by 10 min
incubation at 95jC. Then, the samples underwent 40 cycles at 95jC for 45 s,
60jC for 45 s, and 72jC for 45 s. The specificity of the amplicon was verified
by running a dissociation step.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Kidneys were excised, trimmed, and
fixed in 5% paraformaldehyde, followed by a rapid paraffin-embedding
process. Tissue sections (6 Am) were prepared and dewaxed. Antigens were
retrieved (Dako Target Retrieval Solution; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) by heating
in a water bath set at 97jC for 20 min or a digital decloaking chamber
(Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) and treated with 3% H2O2 for 15 min to
block endogenous peroxidases. After blocking with 6% of the appropriate
serum in 1% bovine serum albumin, the primary antibodies, ERa clone 1D5
(Dako), progesterone receptor (PR) C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), Aurora A BL656 (Bethyl Labs), and Aurora B ab2254 (Abcam),
diluted 1:50 (1:1,000 for Aurora A), were applied to the sections overnight at
4jC. Appropriate secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at 25jC
followed by 1 h with Vector Laboratories Elite ABC (Burlingame, CA). As
negative controls, similar tissue sections were incubated replacing the
primary antibodies with the appropriate normal serum. The slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in alcohol, and mounted in
Permount medium (1:1 permount/xylene) before being examined under the
microscope.
Enrichment of amplified tumor centrosomes. The isolation of
amplified E2-induced tumor centrosomes was done according to Moudjou
and Bornens (27) with minor modifications. Primary tumors (8–10 g) from
the kidney were minced and brought to 50 mL in culture medium
containing 10 AL cytochalasin, 10 AL nocodazole, and 50 AL protease
inhibitor cocktail, all obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The minced
tumor was incubated for 30 min at 4jC, washed and then resuspended in
0.1 TBS/8% sucrose containing 2 AL of cytochalasin, 2 AL of nocodazole,
and 10 AL of protease inhibitor cocktail and pressed through a stainless
steel sieve and filtered through a 105-Am nylon mesh monofilament cloth
(Small Parts, Inc., Miami Lakes, FL). The resulting cell suspension was lysed
in a buffer containing 1 mmol/L of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% 2mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 protease inhibitors, homogenized in a glass dounce, and centrifuged at 2,500  g for 10 min. The lysate
was placed in a 50 mL tube, underlaid with 60% sucrose, and centrifuged at
10,000  g for 30 min. The upper 25 mL fraction was carefully aspirated off,
and the remaining sample was vortexed, overlaid onto a vegetable-dyed
sucrose gradient (70%, 50%, and 40% sucrose), and centrifuged at 40,000  g
for 1 h. The gradient was fractionated into 25 0.5-mL portions [Fraction
Collector and Econo Pump (Bio-Rad Laboratories) Fractionation System
(Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD)]. The fraction volumes were brought to 1.5 mL
with gradient buffer [10 mmol/L PIPES (pH 7.2), 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1%

2-mercaptoethanol], vortexed, and centrifuged at 50,000  g for 1 h. The
supernatant was discarded and the pelleted fractions were stored at 80jC
for further analysis.
Centrosome amplification: size and number. Centrosome size and
number were analyzed by confocal microscopy of paraffin sections
immunolabeled with a monoclonal antibody against the centrosomal
protein g-tubulin (28). Kidney tissues from age-matched control and E2treated hamsters for 3, 4, and 8 months were analyzed (n = 3/group). For
centrosome evaluation in tumor lesions, tumor foci were first identified in
serial sections stained with H&E and PR (C19) from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Once the foci were identified, subsequent serial sections
were immunolabeled with g-tubulin and Hoechst 33342, to label the
centrosomes and the nuclei, respectively (29). Confocal image stacks of
seven 5-Am/L-thick slices were captured with a Zeiss 510 confocal
microscope using a 63 oil immersion objective. Image stacks were then
processed to yield a single maximum intensity projection image. The
resulting image was imported into ImageJ (NIH Image) for analysis. The
g-tubulin signal was thresholded consistently for all the images collected for
each tissue. The thresholded images were then binarized and the area of
each g-tubulin–labeled spot measured and counted. Cells were counted
manually according to the number of nuclei present within an image. On
average, 500 cells per tissue category were analyzed; 106 cells was the
minimum number analyzed. The size of the epithelial cell centrosomes were
normalized against centrosomes in nearby fibroblasts. This normalization
process is based on the assumption that the size of fibroblast centrosomes
is consistent between the individual animals; therefore, it allows valid
comparisons of centrosome size among different tissues in separate animals
immunolabeled at various times, and among images captured in separate
microscopy sessions. Centrosome size per cell was calculated as the
combined region of all g-tubulin–labeled areas in the image divided by the
total number of cells present. Centrosomes in normal tissues are an order of
magnitude smaller than nuclei; therefore, this calculation returns a value of
>1 because sections through cells pass through the centrosomes less
frequently than sections pass through the cell nucleus. In the average cell,
the centrosome will appear in only 1/4 of the sections, whereas the nucleus,
on average, will appear in essentially all sections.
Statistical analyses. One-way ANOVA with Dunn or Tukey post hoc tests
were used for statistical evaluation of the data presented, with the exception
of the Aurora A kinase activity and the centrosome size and number that
were analyzed using t test. Values were expressed as the mean F SE.
Statistical significance was assumed when P < 0.05 were obtained.

Results
Western blot analysis of Aurora A and B in whole kidneys
and tumors during E2-induced oncogenesis. Protein expression
of Aurora A and B kinase was determined in lysates of whole
hamster kidney samples after 3, 4, 5, and 6 months, and primary
tumors after 6 months of E2 treatment (Fig. 1A). Although modest
increases in Aurora A protein were seen in early E2 treatment
periods, a significant 8.7-fold increase was detected in primary
tumors (Fig. 1B) when compared with control cholesterol-treated
kidneys. A slower migrating Aurora A band, presumably the
phosphorylated form of Aurora A, was observed only in E2-induced
tumors of the kidney. No detectable changes in Aurora B protein
expression (Fig. 1A) were seen after 3 to 5 months of E2 treatment.
A slight increase in Aurora B expression was detected in 6-month
E2-treated kidneys. However, a significant 4.6-fold increase in
Aurora B expression was seen in primary E2-induced tumors of the
kidney compared with age-matched cholesterol-treated control
kidneys (Fig. 1B).

Expression of Aurora Kinases during Estrogen Oncogenesis

Figure 5. Centrosomes and nuclei from serial sections of early tumor foci obtained from 3-, 4- and 6-mo E2-treated hamster kidneys (C, G, and K) and adjacent
uninvolved tissue (D, H , and L ) were observed by confocal microscopy labeled with an antibody against g-tubulin (red) and DNA dye Hoechst 33342 (blue ) in
areas corresponding to H&E (A, E, and I ) and PR (B, F , and J ) stained sections. Centrosomes in adjacent uninvolved kidney cells are apical to the nucleus and
often appear as a pair of adjacent spots. The size of the centrosome spots in these samples is uniform at all treatment periods. Many centrosomes in the tumor foci
sections at all treatment periods (C, G , and K) are much larger and more numerous than centrosomes in adjacent uninvolved tissue (D, H , and L).

or had either their E2 pellets withdrawn or concomitantly treated
with tamoxifen citrate for 10 days were analyzed for Aurora A and B
expression by Western blot. The withdrawal/treatment period was
selected because we have previously shown that 72 h are required to
completely clear estrogens from the serum of treated animals (5).
Compared with age-matched control cholesterol-treated kidneys, an
8.0-fold increase in Aurora A expression was detected in all tumors
receiving sustained E2 treatment (Fig. 1D). Upon 10-day estrogen
withdrawal, Aurora A expression was significantly reduced by 78%
compared with tumors continuously treated with E2. Similarly,
coadministration with tamoxifen citrate also resulted in a significant
79% decline in Aurora A expression in these tumors. Correspondingly, E2-elicited Aurora B overexpression also markedly declined
when E2 was withdrawn (81%) or tamoxifen citrate (64%) was
coadministered. Cell proliferation, assessed by Ki-67 labeling was
not significantly altered in any of the tumor groups (data not shown).
Although a significant decline in the expression of Aurora A and B
was observed upon E2 withdrawal and E2 + tamoxifen citrate
treatment, a corresponding reduction in amplified centrosomes was
not observed in any of these treatment groups.

Aurora A activity and mRNA levels in E2-induced tumors.
Additionally, the increased overexpression of Aurora A led to a
concomitant 2.6-fold increase in its activity as detected using a
synthetic construct kemptide as a substrate (Fig. 2A). Additionally,
Aurora A mRNA also showed a significant 6.0-fold increase in
primary tumors in the kidney compared with age-matched
cholesterol-treated control kidneys (Fig. 2B).
Overexpressed Aurora A and B in early tumorous foci. In
order to assess the precise cellular location of Aurora A and B
expression after various E2-treatment intervals, serial kidney
sections containing early tumorous foci (Fig. 3A) were examined
by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. Serial sections of 3.5month E2-treated whole kidneys show that the expression of both
Aurora A (Fig. 3B) and B (Fig. 3C) was confined essentially to cells
present in early tumorous foci. No positive stained cells were
detected in similar tumor foci sections in the absence of either
primary antibodies (Fig. 3D). Positive stained Aurora A (Fig. 3E)
and B (Fig. 3F) cells were also present in well-established large
tumor foci derived from 6-month E2-treated hamsters, but not in
adjacent uninvolved epithelial kidney cells.

Localization of Aurora A and centrosome proteins to
isolated amplified tumor centrosomes. Preparations of enriched
amplified centrosomes were obtained from tumors induced after 6
to 8 months of E2 treatment employing a discontinuous sucrose
gradient fractionated into 25 aliquots (Fig. 4). Western blot analysis
established that fractions 8 to 10 expressed high levels of g-tubulin
and centrin. Both centrosome proteins consistently exhibited the
highest level of expression in fraction 9, whereas their expression in
other fractions was variable and in reduced amounts. Notably,
Aurora A expression was expressed exclusively in fraction 9,
indicating that this mitotic kinase was associated solely with the
amplified tumor centrosome fraction. On the other hand, Aurora B
expression was distributed at least throughout fractions 6 to 10
(data not shown), as expected of a passenger protein kinase.
Centrosome amplification in early estrogen-induced tumorous foci. Small early E2-induced tumorous foci were first detected
in H&E-stained renal serial sections from hamsters treated with E2
for 3 (Fig. 5A) and 4 months (Fig. 5E). These cell clusters of
incipient tumor foci were characterized by their large pale-staining
nuclei (Fig. 5A and E), PR-positive staining (Fig. 5B and F), and
were not evident in age-matched cholesterol-treated kidneys. E2induced tumor foci, at all time periods examined (Fig. 5C, G, and
K), showed a markedly elevated number of centrosomes, which
were unevenly distributed in the cytoplasm compared with
cholesterol-treated, age-matched, and adjacent uninvolved kidney
cells (Fig. 5D, H, and L). In adjacent uninvolved kidney tissue
sections from 3-, 4- and 8-month E2-treated hamsters (Fig. 5D, H,

L), the pattern of immunofluorescence staining of the centrosomal
protein g-tubulin was confined to the pair of centrioles apical to
the nucleus. Similarly, cholesterol-treated age-matched kidney
samples showed comparable levels and location of g-tubulin
immunostaining (data not shown). When 3-month E2-induced
tumorous foci were compared with age-matched untreated control
kidneys, a significant 1.8-fold increase in centrosome number was
observed (Fig. 6). A further significant increase in centrosome
number (2.8-fold) was detected after 4 months of E2 treatment.
Well-established tumor foci also exhibited a 1.8-fold increase in
centrosome number per cell. When total centrosome area per cell
was determined, 2.6-, 5.4-, and 2.5-fold increases were found in
3- and 4-month early tumorous foci, and in large tumor foci after
8 months of E2-treatment, respectively (Fig. 6). An increase in the
number and total volume of centrosomes was indicative of
centrosome amplification.

Discussion
Tumors arising from interstitial uterine-like germinal stem cells
in the kidney are driven by estrogen interacting with ERa, and the
neoplastic progression occurs in the absence of any discernible
histopathologic stages (8). This E-ERa–mediated process is
completely prevented by concomitant administration of either
tamoxifen citrate, progesterone, or androgen competing with ERa
or respective hormone binding to their specific receptors (26, 30,
31). These findings strongly indicate that tumorigenesis is
mediated by an ERa-mediated process consistent with a uterinelike tissue behavior because progesterone opposes the action of
estrogen in the endometrium.
The detection of high aneuploid frequencies, employing
cytogenetic methodologies, nuclear image cytometry, G-banding
karyotyping, comparative genomic hybridization, and fluorescence
in situ hybridization in early tumorous lesions and in large, wellestablished tumors (8, 11, 13) have clearly established that
chromosomal instability and aneuploidy are early events in solely
E2-induced tumors. Moreover, non-random or consistent whole
chromosome gains and losses have been detected in primary
tumors with a frequency of 50% to 88%, depending on the specific
chromosome of all tumors examined (11). Interestingly, similar
high aneuploid frequencies have been detected in E2-induced
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and primary breast tumors in
female ACI rats, and in E2 plus androgen-induced primary tumors
in male Noble rats (32). Taken together, these findings indicate that
these molecular alterations represent a common early pathway in
E2-driven oncogenic processes.
Persistent overexpression of mitotic kinases, notably Aurora A
and B, has been associated with centrosome amplification, which
in turn, is believed to elicit chromosomal instability and
aneuploidy; key molecular changes leading to tumor formation
(14–17). Nevertheless, no definitive evidence has yet shown that
these events are in fact causally related. Persistent Aurora A and B
overexpression in concert with centrosome amplification in early
tumorous foci and in primary tumors elicited by E2, however, is
consistent with previous findings that these molecular events
invariably occur together (21, 33). The early detection of Aurora A
and B overexpression and centrosome amplification in 3-month
tumorous foci, as reported herein, provides additional evidence
that these mitotic kinases may be involved in the incipient events
leading to tumor development. The discovery that Aurora A and B
are persistently overexpressed in early tumorous foci in the kidney

Expression of Aurora Kinases during Estrogen Oncogenesis

and Aurora A in dysplasias and DCIS in female ACI rats (34), both
induced by E2, suggest that these kinases are under direct or
indirect estrogen control. This notion is now supported by our
finding that upon estrogen withdrawal or the coadministration of
tamoxifen citrate in the presence of E2, a marked decline in Aurora
A expression was found in tumors residing in the kidney compared
with corresponding tumors maintained only on E2.
Not unexpectedly, the relative brief period of E2 withdrawal, or
E2 + tamoxifen citrate treatment, did not result in a decrease in
centrosome amplification in tumors in the kidney, even though
Aurora A expression declined significantly. Centrosomes are
complex structures, and the g-tubulin and centrin present in
centrosomes are relatively stable proteins. Therefore, the tumor
cells likely require many cell cycles in order to deplete these
proteins from the centrosome structure. Moreover, when E2 is
withdrawn or blocked, the rate of cell proliferation will eventually
decrease, reducing the opportunity for changes in the contribution of these centrosome proteins to centrosome size and
number.
Because estrogens are the major causative agent in human
sporadic breast cancer, it is not surprising that our findings in two
E2-induced tumor rodent models replicate the high frequencies of
Aurora A overexpression (f94%) and amplified centrosomes
(f80%) reported in both human premalignant DCIS lesions and
primary invasive ductal breast cancer (22, 28, 35). The precise

relationship between the sustained overexpression of Aurora A and
B and the generation of amplified centrosomes leading to
multipolar spindle formation and unequal segregation of chromosomes both in E2-induced early tumorous focal lesions in male
Syrian hamster kidneys and in dysplasias/DCIS in female ACI rats
remains to be resolved. Combined Aurora A and B phosphorylate
more than 20 centrosomal and mitotic protein substrates (21), and
the phosphorylation of individual or cassettes of their substrates
might affect the deregulation of the centrosome cycle, particularly
centrosome duplication.
In summary, we have shown that Aurora A overexpression and
activity and Aurora B overexpression are linked to centrosome
amplification, leading to chromosome instability, aneuploidy, and
tumor development. These critical events occur during incipient
stages of E2-induced oncogenesis and indicate a possible common
mechanism whereby estrogens elicit tumor development in target
tissues.
