ABSTRACT
The persistence of androgen receptor (AR) signalling in castrate-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) highlights the unmet clinical need for the development of
more effective AR targeting therapies. A key mechanism of therapy-resistance is
by selection of AR mutations that convert anti-androgens to agonists enabling the
retention of androgenic signalling in CRPC. To improve our understanding of these
receptors in advanced disease we developed a physiologically-relevant model to
analyse the global functionality of AR mutants in CRPC. Using the bicalutamideactivated ARW741L/C mutation as proof of concept, we demonstrate that this mutant
confers an androgenic-like signalling programme and growth promoting phenotype
in the presence of bicalutamide. Transcriptomic profiling of ARW741L highlighted key
genes markedly up-regulated by the mutant receptor, including TIPARP, RASD1
and SGK1. Importantly, SGK1 expression was found to be highly expressed in the
KUCaP xenograft model and a CRPC patient biopsy sample both of which express
the bicalutamide-activated receptor mutant. Using an SGK1 inhibitor, ARW741L
transcriptional and growth promoting activity was reduced indicating that exploiting
functional distinctions between receptor isoforms in our model may provide new and
effective therapies for CRPC patients.

form, termed castrate-resistant PC (CRPC), that is largely
fatal. Importantly, the AR signalling axis is active in this
advanced stage of disease and thus remains a suitable
therapeutic target [2, 6]. Indeed, the development of
second generation anti-androgen and ADT therapies, such
as enzalutamide [7], ARN-509 [8] and abiraterone [9]
have shown promise in the treatment of CRPC. However,
response rates of just 50% and the development of
resistance has limited their success in the clinic [10–12].
Aberrant AR signalling is a hallmark of CRPC and
is driven by numerous mechanisms including AR gene
amplification [13], somatic receptor mutation [14, 15],
expression of AR splice variants [16] and de-regulated cofactor expression [17, 18] that facilitate receptor activity
in castrate conditions and contribute to treatment failure.
Post-translational modification of the AR represents an

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PC) is the leading cause of male
cancer deaths in the western world and remains a major
challenge to treat effectively [1, 2]. At presentation,
PC growth is androgen-dependent hence the mainstay
for treatment is hormone-ablation therapy using antiandrogens and/or androgen-deprivation therapies (ADT)
[3, 4]. These act to repress the androgen receptor (AR),
a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of
transcription factors that regulates expression of genes
involved in prostate growth and transformation. By
directly competing for androgen binding, anti-androgens
such as bicalutamide, prevent activation of the AR and
hence cause tumour regression [3, 5]. Unfortunately, the
cancer invariably re-appears in an androgen-independent

additional level of receptor regulation with acetylation of
key residues in the hinge region of the receptor playing
a pivotal role in contact-independent growth and tumour
development in vivo [19].
The acquisition of AR mutations during ADT, that
either facilitate transcriptional activity of the receptor in
the absence of androgens or switch anti-androgens to AR
agonists, is a well characterised mechanism of hormone
escape and has been reported to occur in upwards of 60%
of CRPC patients [3, 14]. Importantly, the frequency of
AR mutations in primary disease is low, but is elevated
in advanced disease through therapy-specific selection of
aberrantly functioning receptors [14, 15]. For example,
chronic treatment with the anti-androgens bicalutamide
and flutamide regularly drives selection of respective
ARW741L/C and ARH874Y/ART877A mutations that utilise the
agents as agonists to promote androgenic signalling and
tumour cell growth [1]. More recently, the identification
of an ARF876L mutation in patient samples refractory to
enzalutamide and ARN-509 therapies has indicated that
this is a phenomenon not limited to first-generation antiandrogens [20–22].
Modelling the function of CRPC-relevant AR
mutants in their native context is challenging with
most studies utilising non-PC cell lines, ectopicallyexpressed variant receptors and luciferase reporter-based
transcriptional assays [15, 23, 24]. Outside of LNCaP
cell studies, that express the ART877A mutant, there is a
paucity of information on the functional dynamics and
global transcriptomics of CRPC-associated AR mutants
in a physiological setting that is likely to provide key
biomarkers and additional treatment regimens for antiandrogen-resistant malignancies. Moreover, a major
consideration for the development of next-generation ARtargeted therapies is whether they will be effective against
pre-existing AR mutants in CRPC hence the development
of key research tools to facilitate these studies is of high
priority. To address this, we have developed a novel
RNAi-rescue approach that utilises stable expression
of specific AR mutants in LNCaP cells depleted of the
endogenous receptor to facilitate more robust analyses of
aberrant receptor signalling. Therefore, it is now possible
to assess global transcriptional activity and sensitivity of
CRPC-associated AR mutants to new receptor-targeting
agents in a more relevant cellular context. Using the
ARW741L variant as a paradigm, we demonstrate that this
mutant activates several endogenous AR-target genes,
including PSA and TMPRSS2, and promotes a hyperproliferative phenotype in the presence of bicalutamide; a
phenomenon that can be reversed by depletion of ARW741L.
Global transcriptomics identified a sub-set of ARW741Ldriven genes that are markedly up-regulated compared to
the endogenous receptor, including SGK1, TIPARP and
RASD1. Importantly, treatment with an SGK inhibitor
down-regulated bicalutamide-driven receptor activity and
cell growth, suggesting this could be a novel avenue of
treatment for bicalutamide-resistant patients. In all, we

have successfully applied a novel AR replacement strategy
to physiologically model the ARW741L mutation in disease
and highlighted key distinctions in receptor activity that
could be therapeutically-exploited for improved CRPC
treatment.

RESULTS
Generation of an RNAi-rescue strategy for
testing AR mutant activity
There is a paucity of physiologically-relevant
information on the distinct functionality of CRPCassociated AR mutants and how they drive aggressive
PC malignancy. Studies to date have primarily utilised
reporter-based assays incorporating ectopically-expressed
mutant receptors to assess activity and sensitivity to
receptor-targeting agents in AR null cell lines [14].
Although useful to demonstrate that specific CRPCassociated receptor mutants are activated by distinct
ligands and down-regulated by first- and second-generation
anti-androgens, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figures
S1A and S1B, the failure to assess global functionality
of these aberrantly functioning receptors in this context
is a major problem. Improved models for examining
CRPC-relevant AR mutations are therefore required. To
address this, we developed a more physiological readout for AR mutant activity using an siRNA-mediated
receptor replacement strategy in the androgenic
LNCaP PC cell line. Using the bicalutamide-activated
ARW741L as a paradigm for this study (Supplementary
Figure S1), in part due to its relevance in current clinical
practise, we generated an LNCaP derivative that stably
expressed FLAG-tagged ARW741L, called LNCaP-ARW741L
(Figure 1A). We next designed siRNA oligonucleotides
(termed siART877A) to discriminately deplete endogenous
ART877A (approximately 90% knockdown) by targeting the
3′-UTR of the AR transcript that is absent in ectopicallyexpressed ARW741L mRNA (see Supplementary Table
S2 for sequences). These oligonucleotides downregulated endogenous AR and PSA levels in LNCaP
cells (Supplementary Figure S2A) and attenuated DHTinduced ART877A recruitment to cis-regulatory elements of
the PSA gene (Supplementary Figure S2B). Importantly,
siART877A failed to reduce levels of ectopically-expressed
FLAG-AR in PC3 cells, while an oligonucleotide targeted
to the coding region of the AR (siAR) down-regulated
expression of this protein (Supplementary Figure S3A
and S3B). In the context of the LNCaP-ARW741L cell line,
as expected, siART877A reduced endogenous AR levels,
but did not affect expression of the ARW741L variant
(Figure 1A). Importantly, an siRNA targeted specifically
to the linker region between the FLAG-tag and translation
start site of the ARW741L transcript markedly depleted the
ectopically-expressed protein, but failed to impact on
endogenous ART877A.

To assess if expression of the bicalutamide-activated
mutant impacts on the behaviour of the LNCaP derivative
cell line, we firstly investigated the expression of known
AR target genes PSA, FKBP5 (Figure 1B), KLK2 and
TMPRSS2 (Supplementary Figure S4) in the presence
and absence of 1 nM DHT, 10 nM bicalutamide (proproliferative dose; see Supplementary Figure S5) or vehicle
control and compared to parental LNCaP cells. As expected,
AR-target gene expression was up-regulated by DHT, but
not bicalutamide, in LNCaP cells and this effect could
be negated by depletion of endogenous ART877A (Figure
1B and Supplementary Figure S4A). In contrast, both
DHT and bicalutamide enhanced transcription in LNCaPARW741L cells, and depletion of ART877A further increased
bicalutamide-activated FKBP5 and TMPRSS2 expression
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S4B), suggesting a
potential inhibitory role of ART877A when both receptors are
co-expressed. The effect of bicalutamide on these genes
was specific to the ARW741L variant as knockdown using the
siARW741L oligonucleotide abolished anti-androgen-driven
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transcription, but still enabled endogenous ART877A to drive
gene expression in the presence of DHT (Figure 1C and
Supplementary Figure S4B).

Bicalutamide-activated ARW741L is recruited to
AR-target genes and enhances cell proliferation
We next investigated recruitment of ARW741L to
endogenous cis-regulatory elements of the AR-target genes
PSA and TMPRSS2 in response to 1 nM DHT and 10 nM
bicalutamide using a FLAG antibody. In cells expressing
both AR variants (siSCR), DHT and bicalutamide activated
a subtle increase in recruitment of FLAG-ARW741L to these
loci (Figure 2A). Consistent with gene expression data
(Figure 1), depletion of endogenous ART877A markedly
elevated bicalutamide-activated ARW741L recruitment to the
PSA enhancer and TMPRSS2 promoter and this effect was
diminished upon ectopic ARW741L knockdown. Moreover,
ARW741L is also recruited to the promoter of the KLK2 gene
in response to bicalutamide and this can be attenuated with

ectopic receptor knockdown (Supplementary Figure S6).
Importantly, using a phospho-serine 5 RNA polymerase II
antibody as a marker of transcriptional initiation, we found that
DHT- and bicalutamide-activated ARW741L can facilitate the
assembly of the transcriptional machinery to drive expression
of endogenous PSA and TMPRSS2 genes (Figure 2B).
We next examined the effect of ARW741L on
proliferation of the LNCaP-ARW741L derivative cell line
in response to 1 nM DHT and 10 nM bicalutamide,
and compared to parental LNCaP cells. As shown in
Figure 2C, growth of LNCaP cells was increased by
DHT and this effect was reduced by siART877A, but not
siARW741L. In contrast, growth of LNCaP-ARW741L was
markedly increased in the presence of both DHT and
bicalutamide and only depletion of ARW741L abolished
bicalutamide-driven growth of these cells. To demonstrate
that these findings were not an artefact of this specific
clonal population of ARW741L-expressing cells, we tested
an additional selected derivative (Clone 2) against the
original (Clone 1; utilised in all previous experiments) and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a control transduced cell line (LNCaP-LacZ) that does not
overexpress ARW741L. Importantly, both Clone 1 and Clone
2 showed comparable growth stimulation in response to
DHT and bicalutamide and was distinct from LNCaP-LacZ
that only responded to DHT (Supplementary Figure S7).

ARW741L is inactivated by enzalutamide
Enzalutamide has shown great promise in the clinic
[25], but the fact that not all patients respond to the drug
may indicate the existence of a pre-determinant, such as
an AR mutant, that compromises enzalutamide efficacy
[20, 21]. Given that enzalutamide in many cases is given
as a second-line therapy post-bicalutamide treatment, it
is therefore important to establish if the ARW741L mutant
is sensitive to enzalutamide in our more robust CRPC
model system. To this end, we firstly assessed the effect
of 10 μM enzalutamide on bicalutamide-activated
ARW741L transcriptional activity in LNCaP-ARW741L cells.
As expected, bicalutamide up-regulated PSA and KLK2

LNCaP-ARW741L cells depleted of endogenous ART877A, the
expression profile of ARW741L in response to bicalutamide
was compared to vehicle treated controls and a total of
869 genes were identified as being upregulated >1.5 fold
(Figure 4A and 4B; siART877A). This threshold was chosen
as it fell within fold change cut-offs that have been used in
previous publications investigating AR signalling profiles
[26–28]. As a control, LNCaP-LacZ cells were treated
with 10 nM bicalutamide and the resultant transcriptome
was compared to the gene list identified in LNCaPARW741L cells. Importantly, no genes were identified in
the LNCaP-LacZ control line that exhibited >1.5 fold
up-regulation in the presence of bicalutamide, suggesting
that the identified set of bicalutamide-induced genes in
the LNCaP-ARW741L cells were specific to the ectopicallyexpressed receptor (Figure 4A and 4B). To refine the list of
core bicalutamide-induced genes further, we incorporated
an additional control in which the expression profile of
bicalutamide-treated LNCaP-ARW741L cells depleted of
ARW741L was examined relative to siART877A vehicle and
bicalutamide-stimulated experimental arms (Figure 4A

gene expression, and importantly, this was reduced to
basal levels upon administration of enzalutamide (Figure
3A). Furthermore, ChIP analysis using a FLAG antibody
demonstrated that enzalutamide markedly diminished
bicalutamide-activated ARW741L recruitment to cisregulatory elements of the PSA, TMPRSS2 and KLK2
genes (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S8).
In proliferation assays, we showed that enzalutamide
reduced growth of both parental and ARW741L-expressing
LNCaP cells (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure S9).
Importantly, enzalutamide attenuated bicalutamide-driven
proliferation of LNCaP-ARW741L cells (Figure 3D) indicating
that this second-generation anti-androgen is likely to be
effective in CRPC patients harbouring the ARW741L mutation.

ARW741L drives an androgenic signalling
programme similar to ART877A
We next tested the utility of this model to provide
much needed information on the global transcriptional
targets of the CRPC-relevant ARW741L mutant. Using

in expression following bicalutamide treatment in
ARW741L-depleted cells were deemed to be bicalutamideindependent. We identified 38 genes matching to the 869
core data set that were subsequently eliminated (Figure
4A and 4B); resulting in a refined gene set of 831 genes
whose expression were considered to be specifically
driven by bicalutamide-activated ARW741L. The full list of
bicalutamide-induced genes are listed in Supplementary
Table S4 and include characterised AR-target genes such
as PSA, KLK2, TMPRSS2, NKX3.1, KCNN2 and SPOCK1
We next compared the bicalutamide-driven
transcriptome of LNCaP-ARW741L with the DHTstimulated LNCaP-LacZ cell line derivative. In response
to 1 and 10 nM DHT, microarray analysis revealed
113 and 491 up-regulated genes, respectively, relative
to vehicle control (Figure 4C; Supplementary Tables
S5 and S6). Comparison of both gene lists found 86
common genes (76% and 17% of 1 nM and 10 nM DHT
up-regulated genes, respectively), highlighting a core
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

set of androgen-regulated target genes that are activated
in response to both 1 nM and 10 nM DHT (Figure 4C).
As expected, a greater number of genes were activated
in response to 10 nM DHT than 1 nM DHT, including
FKBP5 (Supplementary Figure S10).
Direct comparison of the bicalutamide-induced
LNCaP-ARW741L expression profile to the core set of
androgen-regulated genes in LNCaP-LacZ, found that
41 of the 86 genes (48%) were common to both lists
(Figure 4D). For example, PSA (KLK3) and KLK2,
which were found to be the most DHT-stimulated in
LNCaP-LacZ cells were also elevated in response to
bicalutamide in LNCaP-ARW741L cells and is consistent
with LNCaP-ARW741L gene expression data (Figure 1C).
We next compared the bicalutamide-activated ARW741L
transcriptome with two published androgenic gene
signatures acquired from LNCaP cells [27, 29]. Of the
respective 21 and 79 androgen-induced genes identified
in the two studies, 15/21 (71%) and 52/79 (66%) matched

important in the pathobiology of disease in CRPC patients
harbouring the bicalutamide-resistant mutation.
To address if the distinct gene-set of ARW741L could
be exploited to provide key targets for CRPC therapy, we
focussed on the potent up-regulation of SGK1 expression
by this mutant receptor. Given that a previous study
indicated that inactivation of SGK1 using the selective
inhibitor GSK650394 reduces SGK1 expression and
LNCaP cell growth [31], we hypothesised that the
LNCaP-ARW741L derivative may be sensitive to this agent
as they demonstrate markedly elevated SGK1 expression
compared to our LNCaP control cells (Figure 5B). To
this end, we assessed ARW741L-driven expression of SGK1
in the presence and absence of 10 μM GSK650395; a
dose demonstrated to down-regulate SGK1 transcript
levels in LNCaP cells [31]. As shown in Figure 6A,
treatment of LNCaP-ARW741L cells with GSK650395
reduced expression of SGK1 by approximately 50%
indicating that activity of the bicalutamide-activated
receptor is potentiated by SGK1 and attenuation of
the associated kinase activity down-regulates ARW741Lmediated transcription. Importantly, SGK1 inhibition
reduced LNCaP-ARW741L proliferation by approximately
70% (Figure 6B) indicating SGK1 is a key down-stream
effector of ARW741L-driven cell growth.
Finally, we conducted a systematic in silico
analysis of a comprehensive PC cohort containing 150
primary tumour samples [32] and identified one patient
biopsy expressing the ARW741C mutation. Consistent with
our findings from the LNCaP-ARW741L derivative and
KUCaP xenograft, SGK1 gene expression was found to
be significantly up-regulated in this sample compared to
all other samples suggesting that this may be a bona fide
biomarker for aberrant ARW741L function (Figure 6C and
Supplementary Figure S15) and manipulating activity of
this enzyme may provide an additional means of treatment
for CRPC patients resistant to bicalutamide.

Exploiting ARW741L-driven SGK1 expression to
inactivate CRPC cell growth
We next focused our attention on identifying
ARW741L-driven genes that were significantly elevated
in response to bicalutamide and distinct from our
DHT-stimulated LNCaP-LacZ transcriptome to define
biomarkers of this specific CRPC-associated AR
mutation and potentially highlight avenues for therapeutic
exploitation. Of the top 20 bicalutamide up-regulated
genes in LNCaP-ARW741L cells (Figure 5A), several were
well known AR target genes, including FKBP5 and
NDRG1, and are elevated in response to 10 nM DHT
treatment in our LNCaP-LacZ control line (Supplementary
Table S6). Importantly, array data indicated that TIPARP
(TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase), RASD1
(Ras dexamethasone-induced 1) and SGK1 (serum- and
glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1) were exclusively and
markedly up-regulated by bicalutamide in the LNCaPARW741L cell line compared to the DHT-stimulated control
LNCaP-LacZ derivative (data not shown). Robust
bicalutamide-mediated up-regulation of TIPARP (57-fold),
RASD1 (93-fold) and SGK1 (109.5-fold) was validated
by QPCR, and demonstrated to be exclusively mediated
by ARW741L as depletion of this mutant by siARW741L
completely abrogated gene expression (Figure 5B). In
contrast, treatment of LNCaP-LacZ cells with a doserange of DHT (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S12)
only modestly increased SGK1 (5-fold) and RASD1
(2-fold) expression and failed to elevate TIPARP transcript
levels while, as expected, PSA was greatly up-regulated
(Supplementary Figure S13). Moreover, analysis of an
additional LNCaP derivative that ectopically expresses
wild-type AR (LNCaP-wtAR) to levels comparable to
that of ARW741L (data not shown), demonstrated modest
enhancement of SGK1, TIPARP and RASD1 transcription
in response to DHT stimulation with respective 4.5-,
8.6- and 5.9-fold induction, indicating that the robust upregulation of the three genes in LNCaP-ARW741L cells is
not due to the phenomenon of elevated cellular AR levels
(Supplementary Figure S14).
To investigate further the discriminate enhancement
of TIPARP, RASD1 and SGK1 by ARW741L, we profiled
expression of these genes in the KUCaP xenograft CRPC
model. This xenograft was derived from a liver metastasis
present in a bicalutamide-resistant CRPC patient and
exclusively expresses the ARW741C mutation [30]. As shown
in Figure 5C, expression of TIPARP, RASD1 and SGK1
were markedly elevated in KUCaP cells compared to the
LNCaP line confirming that key distinctions exist between
transcriptomes of ARW741L and ART877A that could be

DISCUSSION
The selection of AR mutations during androgendepravation therapy is a well-defined mechanism of
therapy resistance that, to date, has been reported to occur
in upwards of 60% advanced CRPC patients [14, 15].
Although unclear, this figure may increase further due
to two key developments: (i) the utility of more sensitive
approaches for detecting mutations in both diagnostic and
basic research [32], and (ii) ease of access to disseminated
disease through the study of circulating tumour cells that
offers a non-invasive means for AR sequencing in CRPC
[33, 34]. Importantly, the presence of mutant AR in
CRPC poses particular clinical challenges as many of the
identified mutations promote promiscuous receptor activity
that enable androgenic signalling by non-conventional
ligands, including bicalutamide, flutamide [14], and more
recently, enzalutamide/ARN-509 [10, 21]; hence limiting

available treatment options in advanced disease. From a
biological perspective, our understanding of the global
functioning of these aberrant receptors is remarkably
limited. Outside of studies in the PC cell lines LNCaP,
that harbour the ART877A mutation, and CWR22RV1, that
express ARH874Y and also numerous alternatively spliced
AR isoforms, there is a reliance upon transient expression
of mutant receptors in non-androgenic cell lines to study,
in most cases, the transcriptional dynamics of these
proteins [23, 24]. Although useful, these experiments
offer little or no insight into global transcriptomics of
AR mutants and lack physiological context. Given the
prevalence of AR mutations in advanced CRPC, defining
their activity in more robust and disease-relevant models
is imperative to help improve our understanding of these
receptors and to potentially exploit their distinct activities
for the development of new PC treatments.
To this end, we developed a novel RNAi-rescue
system to enable the study of AR mutants in the
physiological background of LNCaP cells that have
been depleted of the endogenous receptor. Using the
bicalutamide-activated ARW741L as a proof of concept
mutation, that is also clinically-relevant, we generated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

an LNCaP cell line derivative that stably-expressed
this mutant receptor (LNCaP-ARW741L) and developed
key siRNAs to deplete either endogenous or ectopic
ART877A and ARW741L, respectively. Using this model, we
demonstrated that in the presence of bicalutamide, ARW741L
associates with cis-regulatory elements of several AR target
genes, including PSA and TMPRSS2, and facilitates their
expression. Significantly, these effects were attenuated
upon depletion of the ectopic receptor indicating that the
bicalutamide-driven functionality of ARW741L previously
characterised in AR null cell line studies (Supplementary
Figure S1 and [35]) has been phenocopied in LNCaP cells
with promotion of chromatin-binding and endogenous
target gene expression by the anti-androgen akin to the
DHT-activated endogenous ART877A isoform. Interestingly,
data from both chromatin immunoprecipitation and
candidate gene expression analysis (PSA, TMPRSS2,
KLK2) experiments demonstrated an inhibitory effect
of ART877A on bicalutamide-activated ARW741L when both
receptor isoforms were expressed (siScr control; Figures 1
and 2). We hypothesise that dimerization between the two
distinct proteins may occur in the presence of bicalutamide
and impact on their activity; homodimers of ARW741L

will be transcriptionally potent, while ART877A-ARW741L
heterodimers are likely to be functionally compromised.
By depleting endogenous ART877A from LNCaP cells, the
equilibrium is pushed toward the generation of active
ARW741L dimers to promote more robust AR-target gene
binding and transcription.
To further support the utility of this RNAi-rescue
system to model distinct CRPC-relevant AR mutations,
we demonstrated that the ARW741L mutant promoted
growth of the LNCaP derivative line in the presence of
bicalutamide. The pro-proliferative effect of bicalutamide
was solely driven by the activity of ARW741L confirming
that the ectopic receptor replaces the activity of ART877A
and illustrates the ability for this model to recapitulate
conditions of a bicalutamide-resistant CRPC disease state.
From these promising indications, we next tested
the impact of the second-generation anti-androgen
enzalutamide on mutant activity and growth of the
LNCaP-ARW741L derivative. This is a particularly important
experiment when one considers that new AR-targeting
compounds will be applied to advanced, ADT-resistant
CRPC that are likely to harbour pre-existing AR mutations
[3]; hence defining efficacy of agents toward CRPCrelevant receptor mutations in a physiological model
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

system is critical for optimal pre-clinical drug testing. In
both the presence and absence of bicalutamide, ARW741Lchromatin binding, endogenous target gene expression
and LNCaP-ARW741L growth was down-regulated by
enzalutamide indicating that this mutation is sensitive
to the second-generation anti-androgen. From this study,
it is therefore possible to predict that patients refractory
to bicalutamide through the selection of specific AR
mutations are likely to demonstrate a clinical response
to enzalutamide. However, given that up to 50% of
patients do not respond to enzalutamide [7, 25], it is likely
that other pre-determinants in advanced disease may
compromise AR-targeting agent efficacy; the selection
of other distinct mutations during first-line ADT could
represent one such mechanism of new treatment failure.
Importantly, our novel rescue system would enable
the robust modelling of other CRPC-relevant receptor
mutants that could facilitate patient stratification towards
those predicted to receive benefit from sequential anti-AR
targeted therapy and those that would not.
In keeping with the utility of this model as an
important pre-clinical tool to identify distinctions in
the functionality of disease-associated AR mutations,
we hypothesised that global transcriptomic profiling
26037

of ARW741L would provide key gene targets that could
be exploited for novel CRPC treatment strategies.
Examination of the bicalutamide-activated ARW741L target
gene-set against a control transduced LNCaP derivative
(LNCaP-LacZ) identified a series of bicalutamideinduced genes; many of which were known AR-target
genes including PSA, KLK2 and TMPRSS2. Furthermore,
although the number of bicalutamide-activated genes
were in excess of those controlled by DHT in our control
cells and those reported in Hieronymous et al., [29] and
Nelson et al., [27] there was considerable overlap in the
bicalutamide- and androgen-activated transcriptomes
supporting the concept that ARW741L maintains a common
androgenic expression programme. Importantly, a
number of robustly up-regulated bicalutamide-dependent
genes were identified by micro-array in LNCaP-ARW741L
cells that were not greatly enhanced by DHT in the
LNCaP-LacZ line, including TIPARP, RASD1 and
SGK1. Depletion of ectopic receptor in LNCaP-ARW741L
cells attenuated this bicalutamide-driven response
indicating that these genes are potentially discriminate
targets of ARW741L. This dramatic and selective activity
of the ARW741L mutant is intriguing and may be a
consequence of subtle allosteric re-organisation of the
receptor that permits hyper-activation of the receptor at
distinct genomic loci. By repositioning the C-terminal
activation function-2 (AF-2) domain of the receptor,
the leucine residue may enable more robust interaction
with selective co-regulators to drive acetylation
and methylation of the AR to enhance inherent
transcriptional activity [19, 36].
In contrast to our data, however, SGK1 has been
identified to be robustly up-regulated by endogenous
ART877A in LNCaP cells and the gene product found to
positively reinforce androgenic signalling [31, 37].
The discrepancy between our data and these findings
is intriguing and may reflect key differences in
experimental design and performance, as although we
did detect a 3-fold and 4.5-fold enhancement of SGK1
expression in response to 10 nM DHT by quantitative
PCR in the respective LNCaP-LacZ and LNCaP-wtAR
cell derivatives, it was significantly less than previous
reported.
Importantly, the same study provided evidence that
inactivation of SGK1 with the selective small molecule
inhibitor GSK650395 was able to attenuate LNCaP cell
proliferation in the presence of DHT [31]. Therefore,
given that LNCaP-ARW741L cells demonstrated marked upregulation of SGK1 expression in response to bicalutamide,
we speculated that they may also be sensitive to SGK1
inhibition. Consistent with the reported phenomenon in
parental LNCaP cells [31], we found that ARW741L-driven
SGK1 expression was down-regulated in response to
GSK650395 treatment, suggesting that ectopic receptor
function is dependent upon SGK1-mediated kinase
activity. Furthermore, proliferation of both LNCaP and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

LNCaP-ARW741L cells was significantly down-regulated
upon SGK1 inhibition; with similar IC50 values for both
cell lines in response to GSK650395 (Supplementary
Figure S16). Importantly, in the LNCaP-ARW741L cells,
this anti-proliferative effect was maintained in the
presence of a pro-proliferative dose of bicalutamide. We
have therefore identified a strongly up-regulated ARW741L
target gene that may offer an avenue for therapeutic
exploitation in bicalutamide-refractory CRPC. Although
these observations are based on our rescue model system,
evidence from the patient-derived KUCaP xenograft and
a single patient biopsy sample, that both harbour the
bicalutamide-activated ARW741C mutation [30, 32], is in
agreement with our findings of elevated SGK1 expression
and suggests utility of our RNAi-rescue approach to define
global functionality of the ARW741L mutation.
In all, we have established a novel LNCaP cell
line-based strategy to model CRPC-relevant mutations to
provide important information on receptor dynamics and
global gene signalling in response to distinct activating
ligands.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Luciferase reporter, quantitative PCR and
western analyses
Luciferase assays were performed in HEK293T
cells grown in steroid-depleted media as described in [38]
utilising the p(ARE)3 reporter and pFLAG-AR, -ARW741L
and –ARH874Y. Quantitative PCR was used to assess
expression of endogenous AR-and ARW741L-target genes
(see Supplementary Table S1 for primer sequences) using
cDNA generated from Trizol-mediated RNA extractions
as described in [39]. Western blotting was performed as
described in [40] using antibodies listed in Supplementary
Table S3.

Cell proliferation assays
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays were performed
according to [41]. Briefly, 5 × 103 LNCaP or LNCaPARW741L cells per well of a 96-well plate grown in
steroid-depleted conditions were transfected with siScr,
siART877A or siARW741L for 96 hours as described above
before fixing in trichloroacetic acid for 1 hour at 4°C.
Cells were washed and subsequently stained with 0.4%
SRB dissolved in 1% acetic acid. Plates were air dried at
room temperature, after which bound SRB was dissolved
in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 10.8. Absorbance was measured
at 570 nm using a 96-well plate reader (BioRad). For drug
treatments, 10 nM bicalutamide, 1 nM DHT, or increasing
doses of enzalutamide, were administered for 96 hours
prior to SRB assay.
