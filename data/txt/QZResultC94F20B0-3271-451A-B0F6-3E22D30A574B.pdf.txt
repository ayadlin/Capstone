Abstract
Integrin a5b1 is overexpressed in tumor-associated stroma and cancer cells, and has been implicated in
angiogenesis, tumor survival, and metastasis. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by immune
effector cells has been shown to contribute to clinical efficacy for several IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb)
therapeutics. Taking advantage of these two mechanisms, we generated a fully human, fragment crystalizable
(Fc)-engineered IgG1 mAb, PF-04605412 (PF-5412), which specifically neutralizes a5 and binds the Fcg receptors
(FcgR) with enhanced affinity. In vitro, PF-5412 potently inhibited a5b1-mediated intracellular signaling, cell
adhesion, migration, and endothelial cell (EC) tubulogenesis. PF-5412 induced significantly greater ADCC in a5expressing tumor cells and ECs compared with a wild-type IgG1 (IgG1/wt) or IgG2 of identical antigen
specificity. The degree of ADCC correlated with the abundance of natural killer (NK) cells in the peripheral blood
mononuclear cells but was independent of donor FcgRIIIa polymorphism. In animal studies, PF-5412 displayed
robust and dose-dependent antitumor efficacy superior to that observed with IgG1/wt, IgG2, or IgG4 of identical
antigen specificity. The degree of efficacy correlated with a5 expression, macrophage and NK cell infiltration,
and NK activity in the tumor. Depletion of host macrophages abrogated antitumor activity, suggesting a critical
contribution of macrophage-mediated antitumor activity of PF-5412. Combination of PF-5412 with sunitinib
significantly improved antitumor efficacy compared with either agent alone. The dual mechanism of action and
robust antitumor efficacy of PF-5412 support its clinical development for the treatment of a broad spectrum of
human malignancies. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10243–54. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Integrin a5b1 is a classic fibronectin (Fn) receptor that
plays important roles in vascular biology including embryonic
vasculogenesis, vascular remodeling, pathologic angiogenesis,
and inflammation (1–3). Its involvement in the function of
tumor-associated endothelium and stroma cells has also been
reported (4). In response to proangiogenic factors, a5b1

promotes endothelial cell (EC) adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation (5, 6).
a5b1 is frequently overexpressed in tumor cells and has
been associated with hypoxia, survival, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis (7–9). Various studies
have linked a5b1 upregulation with the progression of several
cancers (10–13). The overall survival in patients with lung
cancers and breast cancers was found to be inversely correlated with the degree of tumor a5 expression (8, 14), providing
a basis for targeting a5b1 for cancer therapy. Among the
several inhibitors against a5 is volociximab (M200; ref. 15). In
the clinic, M200 generated disease stabilization and a number
of partial responses in previously heavily treated metastatic
renal cell carcinoma patients (16).
Accumulating evidence suggests that antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) may play a significant role in
anticancer therapy (17). ADCC is a major immune effector
mechanism in which target cell–bound antibody–antigen
complexes engage innate immune effector cells via fragment
crystalizable g receptors (FcgR), resulting in the killing of
antigen-expressing target cells (18–21). Clinical proof of principle for ADCC was shown for rituximab in non-Hodgkin
lymphoma patients and trastuzumab in breast cancer

patients; in both cases, better therapeutic outcomes were
associated with high-affinity allele of FcgRs, FcgRIIIa/158V,
or FcgRIIa/131H (22–25). Additionally, in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab, the ones
harboring the high-affinity FcgRIIIa/158V allele survived significantly longer than those with 158F/F (26). Importantly, this
correlation was independent of mutant K-ras status, underlining a significant contribution of ADCC to the clinical benefit
from cetuximab.
Several technologies have been developed to improve the
binding affinity between the Fc region and the FcgRs on effector
cells (27, 28). Products through glycoengineering, GA101 (antiCD20), GA201 (anti-EGFR), and MDX-1401 (anti-CD30) have
shown increased ADCC and superior in vivo antitumor activity
in preclinical models compared with rituximab, cetuximab,
and MDX-060, respectively (29–31). XmAb5574, a humanized
anti-CD19 IgG1 monclonal antibody (mAb) with enhanced
ADCC via Fc mutagenesis, has entered clinical development
as a potential therapy for B-cell malignancies (32).
We developed a fully human, ADCC-enhanced anti-a5 IgG1
mAb PF-5412 via amino acid mutations in the Fc region (33).
In this report, we provide evidence of its robust in vitro and in
vivo activities through ADCC and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADPC).

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and compounds
The following mAbs were made at Pfizer: PF-5412 (an IgG1
with DLE mutations in the Fc region), wild-type (wt) mAbs
with identical variable domains but different constant regions
(a5-IgG1/wt, a5-IgG2, and a5-IgG4), negative control antibodies keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-IgG1 and KLHIgG1/DLE, and M200. Also generated at Pfizer are the following compounds: sunitinib [ref.34; a multi-targeted inhibitor of
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors, Kit and Flt3], axitinib (35),
and PF-0337210 (ref. 36; both are potent and selective small
molecule inhibitors of VEGFRs). Bevacizumab (anti-VEGF
mAb by Genentech) was purchased from Northeast Medical
Products, Inc. All antibodies were dosed subcutaneously once
a week (QW) at the indicated doses. Sunitinib and PF-0337210
were given orally once daily (QD), and axitinib was given orally
twice daily (BID).
Cells
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) were purchased from
Lonza. U87MG and A549 were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. M24met was described elsewhere (37).
A549-luc-C8 was purchased from Xenogen. Other luciferaseexpressing cells were made by transfection with vector pLPCX:
Luc-SH. To overexpress a5, parental MV522 cells were
infected with retroviral particles made in 293T cells with
vector pBabe-puro/a5. Human or monkey peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and maintained as
described previously (38). FcgRIIIa polymorphism genotyping
and natural killer (NK)% measurements by flow cytometry

were performed according to published protocols (39). The
generation of mouse, rabbit, and monkey a5-transfected cells
is described in Supplementary Materials.
Generation of fully human anti-a5 hybridoma and
antibodies from transgenic mice
Human transchromosomal/transgenic KM mice from
Medarex, Inc. were immunized with 1  107 NIH3T3 cells
overexpressing human a5. Sera from the immunized mice
were screened by flow cytometry for binding to a5 in a5/
NIH3T3 cells and to the parental NIH3T3 cells. Hybridomas
were generated according to the standard procedure (40).
Hybridomas expressing antibodies that bound a5/NIH3T3
cells, but not the parental cells, were cloned twice by limiting
dilution.
Integrin a5b1 and FcgR binding assays and affinity
determination
Antibody affinity for integrin a5b1 was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) using a Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare;
see Supplementary Methods for details). Human FcgRI was
purchased from R&D Systems. The other human and murine
FcgRs were produced by transient expression in HEK293 cells,
and purified using HisTrap FF columns (GE Healthcare). PF5412 was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using the standard
primary amine coupling protocol. FcgRs were infused followed
by a 2- to 3-minute dissociation phase. Data were fit to a 1:1
binding model (Langmuir) using Scrubber2 data analysis software (BioLogic software). Kinetic variables were used to calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD).
In vitro ADCC assay
A total of 1  104 target cells were preincubated with mAbs
at indicated concentrations. Human or monkey PBMCs were
added at effector:target (E:T) cell ratio of 50100:1. Assay
plates were incubated at 37 C for 4 hours. Cytolysis was
determined using either the LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit
(Roche) or the ToxiLight BioAssay Kit (Cambrex).
In vitro ADPC assay
Human donor monocytes were isolated using CD14 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech) and differentiated into macrophages with 10 ng/mL granulocyte macrophage colony
stimulating factor (R&D Systems) for 5 days. Macrophages
and U87MG target cells were labeled with PKH26 (Sigma) and
CMFDA (Invitrogen), respectively. Labeled U87MG cells were
incubated with mAbs for 30 minutes and then added to the
labeled macrophages. Four hours later, phagocytosis was
determined by counting double-labeled cells by FACS analysis.
In vivo angiogenesis models
To establish the high-density (HD) Matrigel-based human
angiogenesis model, a mixture of HUVEC (3  106) and NHDF
cells (1  106) in HD Matrigel (BD Biosciences, 10 mg/mL) was
implanted subcutaneously (0.8 mL/injection) in the flank of
mice. After 4 to 6 weeks, the Matrigel plugs were removed and
fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde at 4 C overnight, embedded in

ornithine carbamyl transferase, and sectioned for histology
analysis.
Another model is the human foreskin–severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mouse chimera based on the report
by Tahtis and colleagues (41). Briefly, a piece of 1 cm  2 cm
human neonatal foreskin was sutured to the back of a BALB/c
SCID mouse. After recovery (5–7 weeks), M24met cells (2  106)
were intradermally injected into the engrafted human skin.
When tumor volume reached between 50 and 100 mm3, the
mice were randomized to receive treatments. Human-specific
CD31 staining was then used to detect human vessels (42).
Human PBMC/U87MG-luc immunoxenograft model
A 100-mL mixture of human PBMCs (0.5  106) and U87MGluc (1  106) in 100 mL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was
subcutaneously injected to mice. Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and/or digital caliper
measurements.
Experimental metastasis model
A549-luc-C8 cells (3  106/100 mL) were injected intravenously into BALB/c SCID mice that had received a single
predose 2 days prior. The animals were treated with indicated
antibodies for 8 weeks. BLI was carried out once a week until
the end of the study.
In situ macrophage depletion in mice
Clodronate-liposomes (5.5 mg/mL) or PBS-liposomes (25–
200 nm in mean particle diameters) were purchased from
Dr. Nico van Rooijen's laboratory (Vrije University, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). One day before tumor implant, 2
injections of the liposome particles were given to mice (2.5
mg/g body weight, intravenously and 50 mL, subcutaneously,
near the site of tumor implantation). The particles were
subsequently given intravenously twice a week until end of
the study.
Immunohistochemistry staining and quantification of
NK cells and macrophages
Murine NK cells were stained with antimouse NK1.1 (Biolegend), and macrophages were stained using a rat antimouse
antibody for macrophage marker F4/80 (Abcam; ref. 43).
Tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) images were captured
using an Olympus MicroFire digital camera and PictureFrame
software. Percentage of positive staining was quantified using
the ChromaVision Automated Cell Imaging System.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance using Dunnett's multiple-comparison post-test with
GraphPad Prism software unless otherwise noted.

Results
Generation of PF-5412
The mAb PF-5412 was derived from a5-IgG1/wt by mutagenesis in the Fc region to introduce 3 mutations, S239D/
A330L/I322E (DLE), that have been reported to enhance ADCC

www.aacrjournals.org

activity (33), and by mutagenesis of the variable domains to
return several framework residues to those encoded in the
germ line (for details see Supplementary Methods).
In vitro antigen binding and neutralization activities of
PF-5412
SPR- and FACS-based assays showed that PF-5412 bound to
human a5b1 with nanomolar affinity (Table 1; Fig. 1A). The KD
values (2.7 nmol/L for PF-5412 and 2.2 nmol/L for a5-IgG1/wt)
indicated that Fc engineering did not alter antigen binding
affinity. Competition binding experiments using SPR indicated that PF-5412 and M200 bound at the same binding site
on a5b1 (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). In cellular assays,
PF-5412 blocked HUVEC cell adhesion to Fn with a similar
potency as a5-IgG1/wt, a5-IgG2, and M200 (Fig. 1B). In
addition, PF-5412 dose dependently blocked HUVEC migration (Supplementary Fig. S1C). In a coculture tubule formation
assay, PF-5412 exhibited a dose-dependent activity similar to
axitinib (Fig. 1C). PF-5412 also inhibited total and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK; Fig. 1D), a downstream
signaling molecule of a5b1. Consistent with a5b1's role in EC
survival, PF-5412 induced caspase 3/7–mediated apoptosis of
HUVEC with an EC50 value of 15.3 nmol/L (Supplementary
Fig. S1D). PF-5412 was found to bind to integrin a5 of
cynomolgus monkey and rabbit, but not to that of rat or
mouse (Table 1). Consistent with its binding affinity to cynomolgus a5, PF-5412 inhibited monkey monocyte adhesion to
Fn in an ex vivo assay (Supplementary Fig. S1E). These data are
summarized in Table 1.
In vitro FcgR binding and ADCC/ADPC activity
Compared with a5-IgG1/wt, PF-5412 showed enhanced
affinity for FcgRI, FcgRIIIa, and other FcgRs ranging from
6-fold to 122-fold as assessed by the SPR assay. In addition, PF5412 showed enhanced affinity for all 3 murine FcgRs tested
(Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S2A).
In in vitro ADCC assays using U87MG (target cells) and
human PBMCs, PF-5412 induced a 40% ADCC (EC50 ¼ 0.04
nmol/L), whereas a5-IgG1/wt induced a 15% ADCC (EC50 ¼
0.13 nmol/L; Fig. 2A, left). A similar result was observed when
HUVECs were used as target cells (Fig. 2A, right). In the same
assays, a5-IgG4, a5-IgG2, or M200, all of which have minimal
intrinsic ADCC capability, did not induce measurable cytolysis. An enhanced ADCC was also observed with monkey
PBMCs and U87MG cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The
maximum degree of ADCC (ADCCmax) observed with a given
human donor's PBMCs positively correlated with a5b1 receptor density on the various target cells (Fig. 2B, i; Supplementary Fig. S2C). Importantly, PF-5412, but not a5-IgG1/wt, was
able to induce significant ADCC in cell lines that expressed a
wide range of a5 (Fig. 2B, ii–iv).
When fully differentiated human macrophages were mixed
with U87MG cells, phagocytosis was observed in the presence
of PF-5412 and a5-IgG1/wt (0.1 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL), but not
the KLH control mAbs. At either concentration, PF-5412
induced a greater degree of phagocytosis than a5-IgG1/wt
(Fig. 2C). These data indicate that PF-5412 has a greater
potential to kill target cells through ADPC than a5-IgG1/wt.

To investigate if ADCC was influenced by FcgRIIIa polymorphism, ADCC assays were performed with PBMCs from 14
donors representing all 3 FcgRIIIa genotypes. There was no
correlation between ADCCmax and FcgRIIIa polymorphism
(Fig. 2D, left). However ADCCmax positively correlated with the
percentage of NK cells in PBMCs (Fig. 2D, right), indicating
that NK cells played an important role in target cell cytolysis.

3 mg/kg, and the 2 agents showed similar antiangiogenic
activity at 10 mg/kg (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
In the human foreskin–SCID mouse chimera model in
which human vessels were present and expressed human
a5 (44), single injections of PF-5412 dose dependently inhibited human CD31þ vessel formation (Fig. 3B) with an in vivo
ED50 of 1.2 mg/kg and ED90 of 4.6 mg/kg (Fig. 3B, inset).

In vivo antiangiogenesis activity
Because PF-5412 does not cross-react with rodent a5b1, in
vivo angiogenesis models containing human ECs were established. In the HD Matrigel-based human angiogenesis model,
PF-5412 reduced human CD31þ vessels compared with vehicle
or the isotype-matched KLH mAbs, a5-IgG1/wt and bevacizumab (Fig. 3A; *P < 0.05 in Supplementary Fig. S3A). In a
separate study, PF-5412 was more effective than M200 at

Antitumor efficacy
In CB17.SCID mice with functional NK cells and macrophages, weekly administration of PF-5412 at either 1 mg/kg or
10 mg/kg significantly delayed the growth of the U87MG
tumors (Fig. 3C, left). The degree of tumor growth inhibition
(TGI) by the high dose of PF-5412 (86%) was greater than that
by bevacizumab (69%). Antitumor efficacy of PF-5412, but not

bevacizumab, was associated with increased tumor infiltration of NK cells and macrophages (Fig. 3C, right).
We next assessed the TGI of PF-5412 in an immunoxenograft model in which U87MG-luc cells and human
PBMCs were coimplanted in CB17.SCID/beige mice (deficient in host NK). In this model, the human PBMCs served
as a source of neutrophils and NK cells, whereas the mouse
supplied macrophages. PF-5412 treatment induced tumor
regression at 3 and 10 mg/kg. M200 generated moderate
TGI (40%; Fig. 3D, left; Supplementary Fig. S3C). Compared
with a5-IgG1/wt and M200, PF-5412–treated tumors
showed increased NK cell activity (Granzyme B), a greater
number of macrophages, and a higher degree of tumor cell
apoptosis (Fig. 3D, right; Supplementary Fig. S3D). A
separate study showed that the extent of antitumor efficacy correlated with the number of human PBMCs coimplanted with the tumor cells (not shown). These results
indicated that human NK cells and potentially host macro-

www.aacrjournals.org

phages contributed significantly to antitumor efficacy of
PF-5412.
Host macrophages contribute significantly to efficacy
We then used tumor-bearing CB17.SCID/beige mice (NK
deficient) to address whether host macrophages alone could
play a significant role in the activity of PF-5412. We observed
that PF-5412, but not M200, significantly and dose dependently
inhibited U87MG-luc tumor growth (Fig. 4A); the TGI was
associated with a dose-dependent increase in mouse macrophage infiltration in the tumor (Fig. 4B). When the host
macrophages were depleted by clodronate-liposomes (45),
the TGI was significantly compromised compared with mice
treated with PBS-liposomes (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S4A).
The effect was not because of any intrinsic activity of clodronate as clodronate-liposomes alone did not affect tumor
growth (Fig. 4C). These data strongly suggest that the efficacy
of PF-5412 is dependent on ADPC from mouse macrophages.

Dual Functional Anti-a5b1 mAb PF-04605412

The influx of macrophages was detectable 24 hours after a
single dose of PF-5412 (10 mg/kg) and continued to increase
through 72 hours postdose (Fig. 4D). In a separate study,
elevated levels of macrophages in the tumor were observed
for as long as 7 days following a single dose of PF-5412 (data
not shown). A single dose of PF-5412 also induced a marked
reduction of phosphorylated FAK and total FAK in the tumor
(Supplementary Fig. S4B), suggesting a direct effect on a5b1
signaling in addition to or as a consequence of ADCC and
ADPC by PF-5412.
Macrophage-mediated ADPC and efficacy requires the
presence of a5
PF-5412 produced a greater TGI with MV522/a5 tumors
engineered to express a moderate level of a5 (clone 11),
compared with clone 1 that expressed a lower level of a5
(Supplementary Fig. S5A), or the parental cells (do not have
detectable a5; Fig. 5A). The TGI was associated with increased
intratumoral macrophage staining in MV522/a5 clone 11, but
not clone 1 (Fig. 5B).
Antimetastatic activity of PF-5412
In the lung metastasis model of A549-Luc-C8, an 8-week
treatment with PF-5412 and a5-IgG2 exhibited significant
antimetastatic efficacy with a TGI of 97% and 89% (week 8),
respectively (Fig. 5C, left). After dosing was stopped, tumors
in the PF-5412–treated group remained suppressed through
week 13, whereas those in a5-IgG2–treated group began to
regrow 2 weeks after dosing cessation. PF-5412 significantly
extended the median time-to-progression to 20 weeks or more
compared with 14 weeks and 10 weeks for a5-IgG2 and the
vehicle group, respectively (Fig. 5C, right).
Combination of low-dose PF-5412 with sunitinib or
bevacizumab significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy
We further assessed efficacy of combination of low-dose
PF-5412 with sunitinib, an agent with a different antiangiogenic mechanism of action than PF-5412. In the U87MG-luc
tumor model in CB17.SCID/beige mice, PF-5412 (1 mg/kg)
and sunitinib (30 mg/kg, a suboptimal dose) produced TGI
of 46% and 32%, respectively; the combination treatment
produced an 83% TGI, significantly better than either monotherapy alone (P < 0.05 versus PF-5412 and P < 0.001 versus
sunitinib; Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S5B). In the same
study, M200 (1 mg/kg) alone generated a 26% TGI, which
was improved to 41% when combined with sunitinib. This
latter TGI was significantly less (P < 0.01) compared with
that of PF-5412 in combination with sunitinib (Supplementary Fig. S5B).

Discussion
In this report, we showed that PF-5412, a fully human dual
functional mAb against integrin a5b1, potently and dose
dependently blocked EC adhesion, migration, tubule formation, and survival (Fig. 1). The mAb also inhibited angiogenesis
mediated by human endothelial cells/vessels in in vivo
models developed to harbor the human angiogenesis compo-

nents (Fig. 3A and B). More importantly, as a result of Fc
engineering to improve binding affinities to FcgRs, PF-5412
elicited enhanced ADCC/ADPC activity through host immune
effector cells resulting in superior target cell lysis (Fig. 2A and
C), robust antitumor and antimetastasis activities in a cohort
of xenograft tumor models compared with a5-IgG1/wt, a5IgG2, a5-IgG4, and M200 mAbs (Figs. 3C and D, 4A, and 5C).
These are consistent with reports for other antibodies carrying enhanced FcgR binding capacity (30, 31, 33, 46, 47). We
further provided evidence on the molecular and cellular
levels (Figs. 3C and D, 4B, and 5A; Supplementary Fig. S4A),
and pharmacologic level (Figs. 3D and 4C) that NK-mediated
ADCC and macrophage-mediated ADPC significantly and
positively impacted efficacy of PF-5412. Importantly, we
showed a rapid immobilization of macrophages in the tumor
(as early as 24 hours postdose; Fig. 4D) prior to measurable
TGI, suggesting an active role of macrophages in tumor
elimination. In addition, we showed that ADCC/ADPCmediated activity is dependent on the presence and density
of the antigen (a5b1) expressed on target cells (Figs. 2B and
5A). To our knowledge this is the first report with comprehensive in vitro and in vivo characterization of an ADCC/
ADPC-enhanced therapeutic antibody targeting solid tumors.
We observed that PF-5412 produced a similar ADCCmax
with donor PBMCs regardless of the allele variation of
FcgRIIIa (Fig. 2D). Cancer patients with the low-affinity allele
FcgRIIIa/158F have been associated with worse responses to
rituximab (23, 24), trastuzumab (25), and cetuximab (26). In
PF-5412, the binding affinities for the low-affinity FcgRIIIa/
158F and FcgRIIa/131R were more significantly enhanced
than for the higher affinity counterparts (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S2A). As a result, the impact of allelic variations of the
FcgRs on the degree of ADCC/ADPC was reduced. Similar
observations were also reported for a low-fucose variant of
rituximab (48). In addition, our in vitro data suggest that
effector function enhancement in PF-5412 lowered the target
density threshold required to produce cytolytic and antitumor
efficacy compared with a5-IgG1/wt (Figs. 2A and B, 3D, 4A
and B, and 5B and C). Given the prevalence of FcgRIIIa/158F
allele (40% V/F and 40% F/F) in the general population (33)
and the varying levels of a5b1 expression in patient tumors
(unpublished observation), we believe that an ADCC/ADPCenhanced mAb has the potential to impact a much larger and
heterogeneous patient population in the clinic than would a
wild-type mAb. It is also worth noting that although U87MG
cells were used in many of the experiments, the potential
indication of PF-5412 should not be limited to glioblastoma. In
this study, the selection of the preclinical models for proof-ofprinciple studies was mainly based on the expression of the
target in a model.
One of the strategies for rational combination is to simultaneously target multiple processes involved in cancer progression to provide meaningful benefit and circumvent
resistance. Indeed, in the aggressive U87MG-luc mode, where
single-agent sunitinib has not shown robust activity (unpublished data and ref. 49), combining a low dose of PF-5412 (1
mg/kg), but not M200, with a low dose of sunitinib (half of the
projected clinically equivalent dose) produced a robust and

greater than additive antitumor efficacy (tumor stasis;
Fig. 5D). One possible explanation for the synergistic antitumor
activity may be that sunitinib treatment induced tumor
hypoxia, which in turn upregulated a5b1 (7) and sensitized
a5b1-mediated tumor survival pathway. PF-5412 would be
able to disrupt these events by blocking the augmented a5b1
signaling and eliciting strong ADCC/ADPC. Another hypothesis may include phagocytic macrophage subclass sequestration by PF-5412 to mitigate the recruitment and activation
of bone marrow–derived immunosuppressive cells (including
monocytes and proinflammatory macrophages) known to
contribute to resistance to antiangiogenic therapies (50).
Research is underway to gain further understanding of the
observed synergism. In summary, our data imply that such a
rational combination strategy may be a safe and robust
approach for the treatment of aggressive tumors.
From a clinical development prospective, M200, an a5b1
neutralizing mAb, has shown that inhibiting integrin a5b1
in the clinic is safe and may provide incremental benefit
to some cancer patients. Given the observations from
this study, we believe that a5b1 neutralization may be
necessary, but not sufficient, to produce a robust and
sustained antitumor efficacy. Thus PF-5412 may represent

a new-generation integrin-targeting modality that as a
single agent or in combination may deliver a meaningful benefit to a broader cancer patient population in the
clinic.
