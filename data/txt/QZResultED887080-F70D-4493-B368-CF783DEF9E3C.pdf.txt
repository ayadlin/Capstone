Abstract
Tamoxifen therapy is a standard in the treatment of estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer; however, its efficacy
varies widely among patients. In addition to interpatient
differences in the tamoxifen-metabolizing capacity, there is
growing evidence that crosstalk between ER and growth factor
signaling contributes to tamoxifen resistance. We focused on
TC21, a member of the Ras superfamily, to investigate the
influence of the TC21 582C>T promoter polymorphism on
TC21 expression and treatment outcome. Immunohistochemical analyses of breast tumors revealed a higher TC21
expression in ER-negative compared with ER-positive tumors.
Expression in ER-positive tumors was higher in carriers of the
T allele in an allele dose–dependent manner. Quantitative
real-time PCR analyses showed that TC21 mRNA expression is
decreased after transfection of ERA in ER-negative breast
cancer cells MDA-MB-231, UACC893, and BT-20. In MCF7 ERpositive cells, TC21 expression decreased with 17B-estradiol
treatment and increased after treatment with tamoxifen
metabolites, 4-OH-tamoxifen, or endoxifen. In patients treated
with adjuvant mono tamoxifen, high cytoplasmic TC21 tumor
expression or the carriership of the 582T allele conferred
increased recurrence rates [n = 45: hazard ratio (HR), 3.06;
95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.16–8.05; n = 206: HR, 1.79;
95% CI, 1.08–3.00, respectively]. A combined analysis with the
data of the known tamoxifen predictor CYP2D6 showed an
improvement of outcome prediction compared with CYP2D6
or TC21 genotype status alone (per mutated gene HR, 2.35;
95% CI, 1.34–4.14). Our functional and patient-based results
suggest that the TC21
582C>T polymorphism improves
prediction of tamoxifen treatment outcome in breast cancer.

Introduction
Recent developments in breast cancer treatment point to
tamoxifen as a catalyst for the change to targeted therapy (1).
Although 50% to 70% of all estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors
are responsive to tamoxifen treatment, failure and tumor resistance

represent major clinical problems, thus limiting the usefulness of
tamoxifen therapy (2–5). Three possible mechanisms of drug
resistance are currently under debate: Either the patient can
influence the effectiveness of tamoxifen via alterations of drug
metabolism called metabolic resistance, or the ER-positive tumor is
or can become refractory to treatment called intrinsic or acquired
resistance (5). Although tamoxifen itself is a prodrug, 4-hydroxy
tamoxifen and endoxifen have been recognized as the clinically
potent metabolites due to their 100 times higher affinity to ER (6, 7)
and capability of breast cancer cell growth inhibition (8). To this
end, it has become increasingly clear that the hosts cytochrome
P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme activity, which is subject to variation
(9) is critical for their formation (6, 10, 11). Detrimental
pharmacogenetic effects have been reported in that individuals
with a genetically determined impaired metabolizer phenotype had
significantly less favorable recurrence-free time (RFT) and diseasefree survival (12–14). Although this can be explained by
interpatient differences in ER genomic activity, there is growing
evidence that also ER nongenomic or membrane-initiated steroid
signaling activities and crosstalk with growth factor signal
transduction pathways may contribute to tamoxifen resistance.
Activation of ER outside the nucleus leads to the activation of
surface tyrosine kinase receptors (e.g., IGF-IR, epidermal growth
factor receptor, and HER2) as well as interaction with cellular
kinases and adaptor molecules [e.g., c-Src, Shc, p85a regulatory
subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)], which in turn
lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and AKT pathways known to orchestrate cell proliferation and
survival (15–17). These signaling pathways in turn can activate ER
itself or its coactivators and corepressors, thereby increasing the
potential of genomic/nuclear ER activity (5, 18). The role of the
nongenomic steroid signaling calls for strategies for the identification of relevant factors of this intricate crosstalk that may add to
the understanding of disease outcome under tamoxifen.
Among the key components of growth factor signaling are the
Ras proteins for which an involvement in tamoxifen resistance has
been suggested (19, 20). TC21 also known as R-Ras2 is a member of
the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins, which are major
regulators of signaling pathways involved in cell division,
migration, adhesion, differentiation, and apoptosis (21–24). Analogous to the classic H-, N-, and K-Ras proteins, TC21 is the only
other Ras member mutated in human cancers (25, 26). Its role in
tumorigenesis and cell growth regulation has become evident from
the following in vitro observations: GTPase deficient TC21 mutants
showed transforming activities in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts and

other cells (26–28), injection of TC21-transformed fibroblasts into
nude mouse resulted in the formation of highly aggressive tumors
(27, 28), and overexpression of wild-type TC21 caused transformation of MCF10a human breast epithelial cells (29). Although TC21
mutations are infrequent in human breast cancer cell lines and
tumors (25), TC21 protein overexpression has been observed rather
frequently in breast cancer cell lines (29). The TC21 oncogenic
signals are mediated via the PI3K/Akt, nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB),
and Ral signaling pathway (30–33), whereas a role in the activation
of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/MAPK cascade is less
clear (32, 34–36).
The National Center for Biotechnology Information single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database holds numerous entries
of genetic variations at Ras genes of which the TC21 (RRAS2)
582C>T promoter polymorphism (rs11023197) is listed with a
minor allele frequency of 34% in Europeans. Due to the high
prevalence and a possible functionality, we considered it important
to follow-up this polymorphism. We performed functional analyses
to elucidate the effect of the TC21 582C>T polymorphism on
protein expression and conducted patient-based association studies
in breast cancer case collections treated with and without tamoxifen.
Our data provide evidence for the pharmacogenetic relevance
of a Ras protein in the endocrine treatment of breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cells, culture conditions, and transient transfections. MDA-MB-231,
UACC893, BT-20 (all ER negative), and MCF7 (ER positive) breast cancer
cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. ER-negative cells
were transfected with 0, 5, 25, 50, 100, or 200 ng of ERa expression plasmid
pCMV5ERa using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to
manufacturer’s recommendations. Empty pCMV5 plasmid was used to fill
up to a total amount of 200 ng of DNA per well. MCF7 cells were treated
with 1 nmol/L 17h-estradiol, 50 nmol/L 4-OH-tamoxifen, or 50 nmol/L
endoxifen for 24 h. In the case of estradiol treatment experiments, MCF7
cells were switched to medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped
serum for 48 h before treatment.
TC21 mRNA transcript quantification. RNA was isolated from cells
using the Total RNA Isolation Reagent (ABgene) 24 h after transfection or
treatment and reverse transcribed using the Promega M-MLV Reverse
Transcriptase (Promega) according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
Relative quantitative real-time PCR was performed by SybrGreen chemistry
(Eurogentec) using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was quantified in triplicates,
and each experiment was replicated at least twice. The relative mRNA
levels were calculated using the DDCt method, with the h-Glucuronidase
(GUS) as a normalizer. Primers were as follows: GUS (Fw: 5¶-GCTCATTTGGAATTTTGCCG-3¶, Rv: 5¶-ATCCCCTTTTTATTCCCCAGC-3¶); TC21 (Fw:
5¶-AAGTACCGGCTCGTGGTG-3¶, Rv: 5¶-GGTTGGATCATAATCCGTTACAA3¶); and ESR1 (Fw: 5¶-CGGCTCCGTAAATGCTACGA-3¶, Rv: 5¶-AACATTCTCCCTCCTCTTCGG-3¶). Statistical significance was determined using
unpaired t test with Welch correction by GraphPAD Prism version 3.03
software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in 150 AL 1 Laemmli buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris (pH 6.8), 100 mmol/L DTT, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol,
0.1% Bromphenolblue] 48 h after transfection or treatment. Lysates were
separated by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide gel) and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk/
TBST for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Immunostaining was done using
antibodies specific for TC21 [sc-883 (V-20); Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
1:1,000], ERa [sc-8002 (F-10); Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500], or h-Actin
[A-5441 (AC-15); Sigma; 1:5,000] in 1% skim milk/TBST at 4jC overnight,
followed by anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibodies
(1:10,000; 1 h at RT). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemoluminescence using the SuperSignal Western blot kit (Perbio Science) and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

quantified with AIDA software (Raytest). Protein band intensities were
normalized with h-Actin and statistical significance from three independent
experiments was determined using unpaired t test with Welch correction by
GraphPAD Prism version 3.03 software (GraphPad Software).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. DNA-protein interaction was
investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The nuclear
extract from MCF7 and MDA134 breast cancer cell lines was prepared as
described in Schreiber and colleagues (37). Double stranded oligonucleotides used were TC21
582C: 5¶-ggCTATTTTTCGCACACGCCGTC-3¶,
TC21 582T: 5¶-ggCTATTTTTCGTACACGCCGTC-3¶, consensus ERE: 5¶gatcGACAAAGTCAGGTCACAGTGACCTGATCAAG-3¶, and consensus E2F:
5¶-ggTGGAAGTTTTCGCGCTGATG-3¶. Experiments were performed as
described in Rokavec and colleagues (38).
Immunohistochemistry. A tissue array containing 73 breast tumor
samples (45 ER positive and 28 ER negative) was used to analyze the TC21
protein expression. Clinical characteristics of patients are given in Table 1
(expression collection). Immunostaining was done using 2 Ag/mL of specific
primary anti-TC21 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as
described elsewhere (39). Stained tissues were evaluated by an expert
pathologist and a scientist without knowledge of other sample characteristics including TC21 genotype. A cytoplasmic staining score was calculated
from the percentage of stained cells (0–100%) and staining intensity (0–3)
using the Remmele method (40). The cytoplasmic staining of tumor
tissues with scores 0 to 3 was considered negative/weakly positive, and with
scores 4 to 8 strongly positive. Nuclear staining was scored from 0 (no
staining) to 3 (strong staining). The differences in mean expression with
respect to the genotype were calculated using one-way ANOVA, and the
correlations between TC21 expression and genotype status were calculated
using nonparametric Spearman’s rank test. Statistical tests were done using
GraphPAD Prism 3.03 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Patients, DNA extraction, and genotyping. Formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tumor specimens of 486 patients diagnosed with primary invasive
breast cancer between 1986 and 2000 were obtained from the archival
database at the Robert Bosch Hospital Breast Center, Stuttgart, Germany.
This patient collection has been recently described by Schroth and
colleagues (12) who reported on adjuvant tamoxifen breast cancer treatment
outcome relative to the patients CYP2D6 and CYP2D19 genotypes.
The adjuvant mono-tamoxifen treatment group (mTAM) included 206
ER-positive cases. A group of 280 cases without tamoxifen treatment that
received either adjuvant chemotherapy or had no drug therapy served as
control (noTAM group). Clinical characteristics of mTAM and noTAM
patient groups are given in Table 1 (genotyping collection). A subset of this
patient collection (n = 73) was used to set up a tissue array for immunohistochemical analyses referred to as expression collection (Table 1).
The use of archival patient materials was approved by the local ethics
committee of the University Tübingen. After histologic inspection, DNA
was extracted from normal breast tissue using standard procedures. For
genotyping, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization timeof-flight mass spectrometry described by Jaremko and colleagues (41).
Statistical analyses of treatment outcome associations. We tested for
an association between TC21 expression or TC21 genetic variants and RFT
or overall survival (OS). RFT was defined as the time from surgery to the
occurrence of a breast event, i.e., local or distant recurrence, or contralateral
breast cancer and OS was defined as the time from surgery to death from
any cause. Patients who were alive and were without a breast event were
censored at the date of the last follow-up inquiry. Time-to-relapse and
survival data were analyzed by calculating Kaplan-Meier distributions. For
combined CYP2D6/TC21 analysis, we used the genotype-derived CYP2D6metabolizer status that categorizes patient’s metabolic capacity with
respect to the formation of active tamoxifen metabolites 4-OH tamoxifen
and endoxifen taken from Schroth and colleagues (12). Metabolizer
phenotypes are as follows: poor metabolizer (PM), intermediate metabolizers (IM), heterozygous extensive metabolizers (hetEM), and extensive
metabolizer (EM). CYP2D6 PM, IM, and hetEM were combined into the
variable CYP2D6_decreased. Statistical significance of a relationship
between outcome and polymorphism was assessed by log-rank test.
Cox regression analyses showed that tumor size and nodal status were

multivariate Cox regression analyses, these two prognostic factors were
used for adjustment and to test for an independent contribution of genetic

Statistical tests were run using SPSS software version 12.1.

Results
TC21 expression is regulated by ERA. First, we identified the
TC21
582 genotypes of the cell lines: MDA-MB-231, T/T;
UACC893, C/C; BT-20, C/C; MCF7, C/C. On RNA level, we compared
endogenous TC21 mRNA expression in ER-negative breast cancer
cells BT-20, UACC893, and MDA-MB-231 transiently transfected
with 200 ng control vector (pCMV5) or with 200 ng ERa pCMV5ERa
expression vector. TC21 mRNA expression was down-regulated
in cells expressing ERa (in BT20 to 60%; P = 0.042, in UACC893
to 67%; P = 0.0021, and in MDA-MB-231 to 73%; P = 0.21; Fig. 1A).
The control reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) gel images
show the expression of ERa after transfection with ERa expression vector. Next, we investigated the effect of estrogen and
tamoxifen metabolites on TC21 expression. Compared with
nontreated ER-positive MCF7 cells, the expression of TC21 was
reduced by 23% when the cells were treated with 1 nmol/L
17h-estradiol (P = 0.16; Fig. 1B). In contrast, TC21 expression
was 2.3- and 2.4-fold higher when treated with 50 nmol/L
4-OH-tamoxifen (P = 0.019) or endoxifen (P = 0.003), respectively
(Fig. 1C) for 24 hours.
Subsequently, we analyzed the regulation of TC21 expression on
protein level. In BT-20 and UACC893 cells (TC21
582C/C
genotype), the TC21 protein levels were down-regulated to 20%
and 15%, respectively, after transfection of 50 ng pCMVERa with no
further reduction with increasing amounts of pCMVERa (Fig. 2A).
However, in MDA-MB-231 cells ( 582T/T), the TC21 protein levels
were less strongly down-regulated to 40% only with higher
amounts of pCMVERa (Fig. 2A). TC21 protein quantification

revealed significant differences in the capacity of TC21 downregulation by ERa between MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 or UACC893
cells (P = 0.0083 and 0.0075, respectively; Fig. 2A). There was no
difference between the two C/C genotype cell lines BT-20 and
UACC893 (P = 0.22). After treatment of estrogen-deprived MCF7
cells with 1 nmol/L 17h-estradiol for 48 hours, the TC21 protein
levels decreased (Fig. 2B). When MCF7 cells were treated with
50 nmol/L 4-OH-tamoxifen or endoxifen for 48 hours, the protein
levels of TC21 increased (Fig. 2C). Of note, the normalized TC21
expression in all nontransfected ER-negative cells was f3 to 4
times higher compared with nontreated MCF7 cell line. We also
observed a strong reduction of ERa expression after treatment with
17h-estradiol (Fig. 2B), which may explain the weak nonsignificant
reduction of TC21 expression observed in Figs. 1B and 2B.
The TC21 582T allele is associated with elevated TC21
protein expression in ER-positive breast tumors. We analyzed
the TC21 expression in tumor tissues from 73 breast cancer
patients by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3C and D). Of these
specimens, 45 tumors were previously diagnosed ER positive and
28 ER negative. TC21 protein was observed as cytoplasmic and/or
nuclear staining. The cytoplasmic TC21 expression was higher in
ER-negative compared with ER-positive tumors; however, the
difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.09). With
respect to nuclear TC21 expression, there was no difference. In ERpositive tumors, the cytoplasmic TC21 expression was significantly
higher in carriers of the heterozygote 582C/T genotype and even
higher in carriers of the homozygous minor 582T/T genotype,
suggesting an allele dose-dependant effect (C/C versus C/T,
P < 0.05; C/T versus T/T, P < 0.01; C/C versus T/T, P < 0.001;
Fig. 3A). The correlation between protein expression and genotypes
was significant for percentage of stained cells (r = 0.52; P = 0.0006),
staining intensity (r = 0.46; P = 0.003), and expression score
(r = 0.55; P = 0.0003). There was no correlation between
cytoplasmic TC21 expression and 582 genotypes in ER-negative

tumors (Fig. 3A). With respect to nuclear TC21 expression, we did
not observe any significant correlation with -582 genotypes, neither
in ER-negative, nor in ER-positive tumors (data not shown). We
furthermore compared cytoplasmic TC21 expression between ERpositive and ER-negative tumors according to patients 582
genotype. In carriers of the C/C genotype, the TC21 expression was
significantly higher in ER-negative compared with ER-positive
tumors. No significant differences were observed in carriers of the
C/T and T/T genotypes (Fig. 3B).
No specific protein-DNA interactions were observed in
EMSA assays. We tested whether the observed variation of the
allele-dependent TC21 expression may be explained by direct DNA
binding of nuclear factors and performed EMSA assays using
nuclear proteins from ER-positive MCF7 and MDA134 cells.
Experiments were carried out with different binding buffers and
different nonspecific competitors, but no DNA-protein complexes,

neither with the C, nor with the T allele oligonucleotide probes
were observed (data not shown). Control reactions with ERE
consensus oligonucleotide probe showed a specific DNA-bound
ERa complex using identical conditions. Furthermore, in silico
analyses suggested that E2F proteins may bind to the TC21 582
region, a reason why we included control reactions with E2F
consensus oligonucleotides in which we observed a DNA-bound
E2F complex.
Breast cancer treatment outcome with adjuvant tamoxifen
is related to TC21 expression in breast tumors. High
cytoplasmic TC21 expression was observed in 17 tumors (44%) of
39 cases treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. These patients had
increased recurrence rates when compared with patients with low
or no TC21 expression (22 patients; P = 0.0053; Fig. 4A). Adjusted
analysis for the two prognostic factors tumor size and nodal status
showed a significant nonfavorable RFT [hazard ratio (HR), 3.06;

95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.16–8.05; P = 0.023] for patients
with high expression of TC21. No such association was observed in
patients not treated with adjuvant tamoxifen (Fig. 4B). In neither
group, we observed a significant association between TC21
expression and OS.
Breast cancer treatment outcome after adjuvant tamoxifen
is related to patients’ TC21 582 genotypes. In the total of
486 breast cancer patients, genotype frequencies were 38.9% for
C/C, 45.9% for C/T, and 15.2% for T/T, they were in HardyWeinberg equilibrium and matched those reported for populations of European descent. Genotype frequencies did not differ
between treatment groups. Patient and tumor characteristics are
shown in Table 1. In the mTAM group, the minor TC21 582T
allele was associated with a higher frequency of relapse (odds
ratio, 1.87; P = 0.018). Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a
significant allele-dose–dependent nonfavorable RFT for carriers
of the T allele compared with carriers of the major C/C genotype
(P = 0.022; Fig. 4C). Furthermore, adjusted analysis for the two
prognostic factors tumor size and nodal status showed a
significant nonfavorable RFT (per allele HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.08–
3.00; P = 0.025) for patients carrying the minor T allele.
No associations between genotypes and treatment outcome
were observed in ER-positive patients not treated with tamoxifen
(n = 141; Fig. 4D). This was also true for ER-negative patients. In

neither group, we observed a significant association between
genotypes and OS.
Analyses of the combined TC21 and CYP2D6 genotypes in
patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy. We
combined the TC21 genotypes with CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype
data previously reported for this patient collection by Schroth and
colleagues (12) for an extended analysis of joint effects on
treatment outcome. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a significant
nonfavorable RFT for carriers of mutated genotypes at both genes.
Patients with a TC21 582 C/T or T/T genotype who also were
carriers for CYP2D6 genotype predisposing to decreased enzyme
function (IM, PM, and hetEM) had a significantly nonfavorable RFT
when compared with patients with wild-type genotypes in both
genes. Patients with mutations in either one gene had less
favorable RFT when compared with patients being wild-type at
both genes but more favorable RFT when compared with patients
with both genes mutated. The RFT was similar between patients
with wild-type TC21 and mutated CYP2D6 and patients with
mutated TC21 and wild-type (EM) CYP2D6. Altogether, the
distribution of Kaplan Meier curves suggest an allele dose–
dependent effect of the combined TC21/CYP2D6 associated RFT
(log-rank P = 0.0022; Fig. 5). The combined analyses revealed that
patients that were wild-type at both genes (26%) had a relapse-free

of TC21 and CYP2D6 genotypes in our patient collection
showed that they segregated independently (P = 0.59). We did

and OS.

Discussion
This study focused on TC21, a member of the Ras protein family,
which may participate in membrane receptor signaling mediated
nongenomic ER action and, hence, potentially contributes to
tamoxifen resistance. We performed functional analyses of TC21
expression as well as patient-based investigations to provide
evidence that TC21 may be involved in ER/growth factor crosstalk
and influences disease outcome under tamoxifen.
Microarray analyses of breast tumors showed a consistent
association between TC21 mRNA levels and ER status in that TC21
expression was higher in ER-negative compared with ER-positive

tumors (ONCOMINE-CANCER PROFILING DATABASE).7 Our own
data showed that also on the protein level the TC21 expression is
higher in ER-negative compared with ER-positive tumors and cell
lines. These findings, together with our quantitative RT-PCR and
Western blot data, indicate that TC21 expression is repressed by
ER. Moreover, our observation of the 582 genotype based
interpatient variation of TC21 expression in ER-positive breast
tumors suggests that this repression is allele dependent. TC21
expression was significantly higher in carriers of the minor 582T
allele and the increase of expression followed an allele dose–
dependent manner. In a comparison of TC21 expression between
ER-positive and ER-negative tumors according to patients 582
genotype, we observed a significant difference only in patients with
the C/C genotype. In ER-negative cell lines carrying the C/C

genotype, TC21 protein levels were strongly decreased at low
amounts of ERa, whereas in a T/T cell line only, a modest decrease
was observed even in the presence of high amounts of ERa.
Altogether, these data suggest that ERa predominantly repress the
C allele but not the T allele.
The observed allelic difference in expression may have its origin
in variable binding affinities of ERa to C and T alleles. Yet, our
in silico search did not identify sequences reminiscent of estrogen
responsive elements (ERE) within the critical region, and on the
experimental level, specific EMSA experiments did not reveal
any ER binding even when using various nuclear extracts and
experimental conditions. It is well-known that in addition to direct
binding of ER to specific EREs, ER may transactivate target genes
by interacting with other transcriptional factors such as Sp1,
activator protein, and NF-nB. We performed EMSA experiments
with nuclear extracts of cell lines in which we observed ERmediated changes in TC21 mRNA expression, pointing to the
presence of proteins relevant to these changes. However, in the
light of EMSA being an in vitro method, there is a possibility that
we might have not been able to reproduce the in vivo conditions
under which the regulatory mechanisms of the TC21 promoter
may involve ER-dependent transcriptional regulation. An alternative explanation would be that the TC21 528C>T is not the
causative variant but rather is in linkage disequilibrium with
another functional polymorphism in the upstream promoter
region. We therefore examined linkage disequilibrium patterns
across the chromosomal region surrounding the 582C>T
polymorphism and performed in silico analyses to study transcription factor binding sites that could be altered by SNPs linked with
the 582C>T (Supplementary Table S1). We did not observe any
EREs in these SNP regions, but there are Sp1 and Oct-1 binding
sites, which could be indirectly regulated by ER. Future functional
and association studies therefore should address the biological
relevance of these linked SNPs.
Based on our hypothesis of TC21 being involved in ER/growth
factor crosstalk, we further asked the question whether TC21
protein expression and in particular the TC21 582C>T polymorphism hold the potential to improve breast cancer prognosis and
prediction of disease outcome under tamoxifen. In the adjuvant
tamoxifen patient group in which tamoxifen was the sole
anticancer drug treatment, patients with strong cytoplasmic

TC21 expression in their tumors had significantly less favorable
RF rates when compared with patients with no or weak TC21
expression. No such differences were observed among patients
without tamoxifen treatment. Our observation of TC21 expression
being a predictor of tamoxifen response is in line with data from a
microarray gene expression study by Ma and colleagues (42), which
is accessible at the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number
GSE1378).8 This study provided expression and clinical data of 60
ER-positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.
Upon calculation of Kaplan-Meier distributions, we observed a
significant nonfavorable RF probability for patients with high TC21
mRNA expression (log2 Cy5/Cy3 ratio, > 1) compared with
patients with low TC21 expression (log2 Cy5/Cy3 ratio, < 1).
Stratification of our adjuvant mono-tamoxifen–treated patient
collection by the TC21 582 genotype showed a significant less
favorable RF probability for carriers of the minor T allele. Again,
these differences were not observed in patients without tamoxifen
treatment. We conclude that the TC21 is a potential classifier of
tamoxifen treatment outcome, a notion that is in agreement with
the current literature (16, 43) on ER and growth factor signaling.
Based on our observation that the presence of tamoxifen
metabolites increases TC21 expression, we suggest that a
tamoxifen-mediated increase of TC21 levels may contribute to an
increase of growth factor signaling, thus promoting the adaptive
type of tamoxifen resistance. To this end, the crosstalk between ER
and growth factor signaling associated with resistance to tamoxifen
is contributed by ER nuclear and ER membrane–initiated steroid
signaling (17). Of note, the latter can be activated by both estrogen
and selective ER modulators such as tamoxifen (44, 45).
Accordingly, the survival of breast cancer cells even in the presence
of tamoxifen (46) has been attributed to the bidirectional crosstalk
between ER and growth factor receptor–initiated signaling
cascades, e.g., PI3K/Akt and MAPK. This self-stimulatory cycleintensifying ER activity may be contributed by TC21 at the level of
Ras signaling, which may be driven by ER-dependent TC21
regulation on the level of ER target gene expression.
In the light of our recent findings of genetically determined
impaired CYP2D6 activity being a predictor for nonfavorable

TC21 and Tamoxifen Treatment Outcome

tamoxifen treatment outcome of breast cancer (12, 47), we
extended the analysis of RF probability as a function of combined
TC21 and CYP2D6 genotypes. Importantly, the individual TC21
and CYP2D6 analyses were performed in the same patient
collection and both polymorphisms segregated independently;
therefore, the assessment of combined effects was reasonable. At
5-year follow-ups, patients with major genotypes at both loci
(TC21_wt/2D6EM) had an RF probability of 93% and this
remained at high level even on long term. Of note, the combined
data show a 12% to 14% improved RF probability compared with
CYP2D6EM or TC21_wt status alone. In contrast, the 5-year RF
probability was only 70% in patients with mutated genotypes in
both genes (TC21_mut/2D6decreased) and worsened over time in
that at 10 years, every other patient had experienced recurrence.
Patients with a mutated genotype in either TC21 or CYP2D6 had
less favorable RFT when compared with patients with both
regular genotypes but more favorable RFT when compared with
patients with both genes mutated. This pattern suggested a
compound TC21-CYP2D6 gene dose-dependent relationship.
Interestingly, RFT probability curves were similar, independent
of whether TC21 or CYP2D6 was mutated. Accordingly, a
nonmutated TC21 was capable to partially overcome the
disadvantage of an impaired CYP2D6 genotype. In contrast, a
mutated TC21 was able to partially override the favorable effect
of a CYP2D6EM genotype toward a less favorable effect on RFT.
Strikingly, the effect of TC21 on RF rates was most pronounced in
patients with CYP2D6-decreased genotype, suggesting an additive
effect of TC21 that modulates a patient’s constitutional resistance
based on CYP2D6 genotypes. For a judgment of the combined
pharmacogenetic relevance of both genes in tamoxifen resistance,
it is important to recall that although genotypes have been

established at the constitutional level, their functional consequences in case of CYP2D6 affect the hosts’ tamoxifen metabolic
capacity and, in case of TC21, the tumor bound ER growth factor
crosstalk. Our findings therefore support the notion that
tamoxifen resistance may depend on the level of both, host
genetic, and tumor-adaptive elements (5). We speculate that
complementary TC21 and CYP2D6 analyses will identify patients
likely to benefit from tamoxifen and those in need for alternative
treatment with a higher accuracy due to the different underlying
biological principles.
In summary, our TC21 functional and patient-based pharmacogenetic findings are congruent and in line with current views on
tamoxifen resistance. TC21 may therefore be regarded as a novel
candidate for the testing of its value in the prediction of tamoxifen
treatment outcome in larger studies and prospective clinical trials.
To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first time draws
attention to the relevance of a Ras protein in the context of
tamoxifen pharmacogenetics of breast cancer.
