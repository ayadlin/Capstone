ABSTRACT
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven oxidative stress has been recognized
as a critical inducer of cancer cell death in response to therapeutic agents. Our
previous studies have demonstrated that zinc finger protein (ZNF)32 is key to
cell survival upon oxidant stimulation. However, the mechanisms by which ZNF32
mediates cell death remain unclear. Here, we show that at moderate levels of ROS,
Sp1 directly binds to two GC boxes within the ZNF32 promoter to activate ZNF32
transcription. Alternatively, at cytotoxic ROS concentrations, ZNF32 expression is
repressed due to decreased binding activity of Sp1. ZNF32 overexpression maintains
mitochondrial membrane potential and enhances the antioxidant capacity of cells
to detoxify ROS, and these effects promote cell survival upon pro-oxidant agent
treatment. Alternatively, ZNF32-deficient cells are more sensitive and vulnerable to
oxidative stress-induced cell injury. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that complement
1q-binding protein (C1QBP) is a direct target gene of ZNF32 that inactivates the
p38 MAPK pathway, thereby exerting the protective effects of ZNF32 on oxidative
stress-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings indicate a novel mechanism
by which the Sp1-ZNF32-C1QBP axis protects against oxidative stress and implicate
a promising strategy that ZNF32 inhibition combined with pro-oxidant anticancer
agents for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.

intrinsic signals, including various cellular stresses or
cytotoxic drugs that may induce the activation of certain
pro-apoptotic proteins. Dysfunctional apoptosis has been
determined to be a unique trait of cancer development.

The mechanism by which cancer cells escape apoptosis
remains of great interest in oncological research, and
apoptotic signaling has become a major target of cancer
treatment. To date, multiple factors, particularly ROSdriven oxidative stress, have been found to induce
apoptosis [1, 2].
ROS, including the superoxide radical (O2−),
the hydroxyl radical (HO.), and hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2), are physiologically generated continuously as
byproducts of cellular processes such as mitochondrial
metabolism. Recent evidence suggests that intracellular
biological responses to certain levels of ROS vary greatly
[3–5]. At low to moderate levels, ROS act as essential
second messengers by which cytokines and growth
factors promote cell proliferation and survival [6–8].
Alternatively, excessive ROS levels exert serious oxidative
stress on cells, cause damage to cellular components
such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, and ultimately induce
cell death. ROS has been reported to be involved in
various aspects of cancer pathogenesis, including the
alteration of cellular signaling, gene expression [9, 10],
DNA mutations, genomic stability, [11, 12], and chronic
inflammation [13]. Although an increased level of ROS
has been observed in cancer cells compared with normal
cells, ROS homeostasis can be achieved in cancer cells
by elevating antioxidant-scavenging capacity to promote
cell proliferation and acquired drug resistance [14–16].
Based on these considerations, ROS homeostasis has been
demonstrated to be disturbed via the suppression of the
antioxidant system or the direct addition of ROS inducers;
these therapies synergistically enhance the cytotoxicity of
pro-oxidant-based anticancer agents and promote cancer
cell death. These findings implicate ROS homeostasis as a
potential target for cancer treatment [17–19].
Mitochondria perform critical functions in many
cellular processes, including ATP production, fatty acid
oxidation, apoptosis, and necrosis [20–22]. Mitochondria
represent both the primary source of ROS and the
primary target of ROS damage. Excess ROS generated
by mitochondria cause mitochondrial permeability
transition pore (mPTP) opening, which results in the
loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; increased
ROS production; mitochondrial rupture and dysfunction;
and, ultimately, cell death [23–25]. C1QBP, a conserved
eukaryotic protein that is predominantly localized to
mitochondria, is an essential component of the mPTP
complex that contributes to mitochondrial-dependent cell
death [26]. Notably, the mPTP, which has been shown
to be a causative factor in the pathogenesis of many
diseases, is another target for anti-cancer therapy [27–29].
For example, 2-methoxyestradiol has been shown to
inhibit the proliferation of and induce apoptosis in human
neuroblastoma cells by increasing the ROS levels and
abolishing the mitochondrial membrane potential [30].
Zinc finger protein (ZNF)32 is a newly identified
ZNF in Homo sapiens that belongs to the Krüppel-like
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

family of transcription factors (KLF). In our previous
study, we demonstrated that overexpression of the mouse
ZNF32 homolog Zfp637 markedly increased mTERT
expression and telomerase activity, maintained telomere
length, and inhibited both H2O2- and D-galactose-induced
cell death, which is accompanied by reduced ROS
production [31]. Moreover, ZNF32 inhibits autophagy
initiation by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway to protect
breast cancer cells from stimulus-induced cell death [32].
However, how ZNF32 transcription is modulated during
oxidative stress and the mechanisms by which ZNF32
influences cell viability in response to oxidative stress
remain unknown.
In this study, we show that the expression of ZNF32
is regulated by Sp1-mediated transcription in response
to oxidative stress. ZNF32 downregulation promotes
the apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells
exposed to the pro-oxidant agents, whereas ZNF32
overexpression protects against this effect. C1QBP is
recognized as a target gene of ZNF32 that is essential
for ZNF32 to sustain mitochondrial membrane potential
and enhance cellular resistance to oxidative stress. These
findings demonstrate that the Sp1-ZNF32-C1QBP axis
resists oxidative stress and implicate ZNF32 as a potential
target to enhance the efficacy of pro-oxidant agents in
cancer therapy.

RESULTS 
ZNF32 is regulated by Sp1 at the transcriptional
level in response to oxidative stress
Previously, we showed that the expression of
mouse ZNF32 homolog Zfp637 was significantly
altered in NIH3T3 fibroblasts when treated with H2O2,
indicating a potential role of ZNF32 in oxidative stress
[33]. To determine whether oxidative stress modulates
ZNF32 expression in humans, HepG2 cells were treated
with H2O2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
Interestingly, the expression of ZNF32 increased
following low-dose H2O2 treatment (0.1 or 0.25 mM) for
24 h but decreased gradually when treated with higher
doses of H2O2 (greater than 0.5 mM) (Supplementary
Figure S1A). Similarly, the expression of ZNF32
increased in response to acute exposure to 0.5 mM H2O2
for up to 2 h and then declined by 4 h (Supplementary
Figure S1B). To further clarity whether these responses
were redox-specific, HepG2 cells were pretreated with
the antioxidant agent N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or
butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Pretreatment with
either NAC or BHA significantly ameliorated the
decrease in ZNF32 expression induced by treatment with
0.5 mM H2O2 for 24 h as well as the increase in ZNF32
expression induced by treatment with 0.1 mM H2O2
for 24 h or with 0.75 mM H2O2 for 1 h (Supplementary
Figures S1C–S1E).

To identify potential transcriptional regulators of
ZNF32 under oxidative stress conditions, functional
5′-deletion analysis of an approximately 1.5-kb region of
the ZNF32 promoter was performed by generating a series
of deletion mutants fused to a luciferase reporter gene.
As shown in Figure 1A, the activities of the (−1443/+66),
(−1139/+66), (−386/+66) and (−178/+66) regions of
the ZNF32 promoter were significantly decreased by
0.5 mM H2O2 treatment. Next, we analyzed the ZNF32
promoter sequence and found two putative Sp1 response
elements, located at -1318/-1304 and -43/-27; each of
which was within an oxidative stress-responsive region

(Figure 1B). The transcription factor Sp1 has been shown
to mediate oxidative stress–induced gene transcription
[34–36]. Thus, we sought to determine whether ZNF32
expression is regulated by Sp1. As shown in Figure
1C, higher mRNA and protein levels of ZNF32 were
observed in Sp1-overexpressing cells than in control cells.
To locate the Sp1-binding sites, we sequentially
engineered luciferase reporter constructs that were mutated
at one or two sites from the corresponding wild-type
construct. As shown in Figure 1D, compared with wildtype ZNF32 (-1443/+66), functional loss of either of the
identified Sp1-response elements inhibited basal luciferase

activity at the ZNF32 promoter. Moreover, H2O2 treatment
significantly decreased the transcriptional activity of
the wild-type and each single Sp1 site-mutated ZNF32
promoter but not the mutant ZNF32 promoters in which
both Sp1 sites were disrupted (Figure 1D). In a parallel
experiment, H2O2 attenuated the increase in transcription
at the ZNF32 promoter via Sp1 overexpression (Figure
1E). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed
that nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells interacted with
each probe containing an Sp1 site derived from the ZNF32
promoter but that addition of 0.5 mM H2O2 decreased
the levels of the shifted complex (Figure 1F). Moreover,
overexpression of Sp1 increased the formation of DNAnucleoprotein complexes, but this effect was attenuated
by 0.5 mM H2O2 treatment (Figure 1F). Accordingly, a
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed
decreased binding of Sp1 to the endogenous ZNF32
promoter regions containing GC-rich boxes after treatment
with 0.5 mM H2O2 (Figure 1G).
As ZNF32 transcription was increased upon
treatment with a low dose of H2O2, we investigated
whether the expression of ZNF32 was also induced by Sp1
in response to 0.1 mM H2O2. As shown in Supplementary
Figure S1F, 0.1 mM H2O2 treatment elevated the luciferase
activity of ZNF32 (-1443/+66) but not the Sp1 site
double-mutant ZNF32 promoter. Notably, 0.1 mM H2O2
and Sp1 synergistically facilitated ZNF32 transcription
(Supplementary Figure S1F). Consistently, the binding
activity of Sp1 was augmented by 0.1 mM H2O2 treatment
(Supplementary Figure S1G). Taken together, these results
suggest that Sp1 delicately regulates the transcription of
ZNF32 upon oxidative stress, clearly implying a function
of ZNF32 in oxidative stress.

3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP),
were significantly increased in ZNF32-knockdown
cells, but this pro-apoptotic effect was largely reversed
by ZNF32 overexpression (Figures 2E and 2F). Taken
together, these results suggest that ZNF32 overexpression
protects against oxidative stress-induced cell injury but
that knockdown of ZNF32 renders cells more sensitive
and vulnerable to oxidative challenge. These findings
implicate ZNF32 as a negative regulator of oxidative
stress-induced apoptosis.

Overexpression of ZNF32 protects mitochondrial
membrane potential and the antioxidant system
upon oxidative stress
Next, we investigated the mechanisms underlying
the ZNF32-dependent modulation of H2O2 damage.
ZNF32-overexpressing cells showed a lower ROS level
than control cells following the exogenous addition
of H2O2 (Figure 3A). Conversely, the intracellular
concentrations of ROS were significantly increased in
ZNF32-depleted cells treated with H2O2 (Figure 3B).
Next, we measured the levels of malondialdehyde
(MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation damage, in cell
culture supernatants. Similar to the above results, a
protective effect of ZNF32 overexpression was observed
in cells exposed to H2O2 (Figure 3C), but oxidative
stress-induced MDA formation was significantly
increased in ZNF32-silenced cells (Figure 3D).
Mitochondria perform critical functions in oxidative
stress-induced apoptosis, and one mechanism by which
mitochondrial failure causes apoptosis involves the loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential and the generation
of ROS [39]. As ZNF32 overexpression suppressed the
ROS production and apoptosis induced by H2O2, we
further tested whether ZNF32 affects the mitochondrial
membrane potential under oxidative stress. Consistently,
ZNF32 overexpression greatly suppressed oxidative
stress-induced mPTP opening according to the
fluorescent JC-1 aggregation assay (Figure 3E), whereas
knockdown of ZNF32 greatly reduced the mitochondrial
membrane potential upon H2O2 treatment (Figure 3F).
To further clarity whether ZNF32 activates intracellular
antioxidant systems, we detected the activity of catalase,
which converts H2O2 into O2 and H2O. In agreement with
the above results, ZNF32 overexpression cells showed
higher catalase activity than control cells following
H2O2 treatment (Figure 3G). In contrast, catalase
activity was significantly decreased in ZNF32-depleted
cells following H2O2 treatment (Figure 3H). Similar
phenomena were observed in HepG2 cells treated
with PL (Supplementary Figure S3). In summary, our
results implied that ZNF32-deficient cells were more
sensitive to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis due
to mitochondrial dysfunction and antioxidant system
deficiency.

Overexpression of ZNF32 increases the threshold
for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis
To address whether ZNF32 plays a functional
role in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, we
altered the ZNF32 levels in HepG2 cells via ectopic
expression of ZNF32 cDNA or ZNF32-specific short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) using lentiviral technology
(Supplementary Figure S2). Cells were treated with H2O2
or piperlongumine (PL), a pro-oxidant drug that has been
well characterized to selectively kill cancer cells [37,
38]. We found that neither overexpression nor depletion
of ZNF32 significantly affected the viability of HepG2
cells (Figures 2A and 2B). However, when the cells were
treated with H2O2 or PL, increased cell viability was
observed in ZNF32-overexpressing cells compared with
control cells (Figure 2A), whereas ZNF32-silenced cells
exhibited significantly decreased cell viability (Figure
2B). These findings were confirmed by an Annexin
V/propidium iodide (PI) assay (Figures 2C and 2D).
Furthermore, when the cells were treated with H2O2 or
PL, the levels of two apoptosis markers, cleaved caspase

C1QBP is essential for ZNF32 to sustain the
mitochondrial membrane potential during
oxidative stress

the 10 selected genes were significantly correlated with
ZNF32. Next, 3 of these 10 genes were chosen for further
examination by immunoblot analysis. Consistently, ZNF32
overexpression induced elevated C1QBP and PGK1 protein
expression but repressed HSPB1 expression (Figure 4B).
Given the critical role of mitochondria in the regulation
of ROS homeostasis and apoptosis, we inferred that the
mechanisms by which ZNF32 suppression caused apoptosis
upon oxidant treatment involved the loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential, followed by increased ROS generation,
mitochondrial dysfunction and, ultimately, caspase cascade
activation. C1QBP, a substantial component of the mPTP
complex, is involved in regulating oxidative phosphorylation
and inner mitochondrial membrane permeability [40]. As
aberrant regulation of C1QBP is sufficient to induce mPTP
opening and subsequent mitochondria-dependent apoptosis
[41–43], C1QBP was selected for further mechanistic study.
To explore whether C1QBP is involved in resistance
to oxidative stress, we first determined the expression of
C1QBP upon treatment with increasing concentrations of
H2O2. Our data showed that lower H2O2 levels (0.1 and 0.25
mM) increased C1QBP expression but that higher levels
of H2O2 (0.5, 0.75 and 1 mM) treatment inhibited C1QBP
transcription (Supplementary Figure S5A). Moreover,
C1QBP knockdown promoted apoptosis and reduced the
viability of HepG2 cells treated with 0.5 mM H2O2 for 24

To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms
underlying the decreased susceptibility of ZNF32overexpressing cells to oxidative stress, two-dimensional
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE)-based proteomic
analysis was performed to identify the key responsive proteins
involved in this process. Representative paired gel images
from the 2-DE analysis are shown in Supplementary Figure
S4A. Detailed information for the 24 identified proteins is
provided in Table 1. The identified proteins were divided into
various groups based on their subcellular localization and
biological functions (Supplementary Figures S4B and S4C).
The intrinsic interactions of these proteins were analyzed
using the web-based tool STRING. The apoptosis-regulating
proteins and stress-responsive proteins were grouped into
specific clusters (Supplementary Figure S4D). Interestingly,
these proteins were linked together when MAPK1 (also
known as p38) and TNFα, two critical proteins involved in
ROS and cell death signaling, were added to the analysis
(Supplementary Figure S4E). Among the 24 identified
proteins, we selected 10 genes that were associated with cell
proliferation, metabolism and stress responses to validate
their correlation with ZNF32. As shown in Figure 4A, 8 of

h compared with endogenous C1QBP expression. However,
no significant alterations were observed in C1QBP-silenced
HepG2 cells treated with 0.1 mM or 0.25 mM H2O2 for 24
h (Supplementary Figures S5B and S5C). These results
indicate that C1QBP protects cells from oxidative stressinduced apoptosis.
Based on the structure and localization of ZNF32,
we inferred that ZNF32 may function as a transcription
factor and identified a consensus binding site in ZNF32
(GACTTT) based on cyclic amplification and selection of
targets (manuscript in preparation). The C1QBP promoter
sequence was analyzed, and one putative ZNF32-binding
site, located at -1067/–1062 bp, was found. We confirmed
that the GST-ZNF32 fusion protein formed protein-DNA
complexes with oligonucleotides derived from the C1QBP
promoter (-1081/–1048 bp) (Figure 4C). In agreement
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with the above results, the ChIP assay revealed that
ZNF32 directly binds to the promoter of C1QBP but that
this binding is decreased by H2O2 treatment (Figure 4D).
To address the role of C1QBP in the ZNF32-dependent
regulation of apoptosis in response to oxidative stress,
we depleted C1QBP using specific siRNA in ZNF32overexpressing HepG2 cells (Figure 4E). C1QBPdeficient cells exhibited increased ROS generation and
reduced mitochondrial membrane potential upon H2O2
treatment despite ZNF32 overexpression (Figures 4F
and 4G). Accordingly, the protective effect of ZNF32
overexpression against H2O2-induced toxicity was
reversed by the depletion of C1QBP (Figures 4H–4J).
These results indicate that the ZNF32-C1QBP signaling
axis regulates cell susceptibility to oxidative stressinduced apoptosis.

C1QBP knockdown facilitates the activation of the
p38 MAPK pathway in response to oxidative stress

C1QBP expression. Conversely, H2O2 further stimulated
the p38 MAPK pathway in C1QBP-silenced cells
(Figure 5B). To determine whether C1QBP functions
in apoptosis via a p38 MAPK-dependent pathway,
we pretreated cells with the p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB203580 prior to H2O2 treatment. Interestingly, the
inhibition of p38 MAPK significantly attenuated the
decrease the viability of C1QBP-silenced cells treated
with H2O2 (Figure 5C). Consistently, SB203580
treatment effectively suppressed the formation of
cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP in C1QBPsilenced cells following H2O2 treatment (Figure 5D).
Similar phenomena were observed in HepG2 cells
treated with PL (Supplementary Figures S6A–S6C).
To further determine the influence of ZNF32 on the
activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway,
ZNF32-overexpressing HepG2 cells were pretreated

As described above, C1QBP knockdown
accelerates ROS accumulation upon oxidant treatment,
and STRING network analysis demonstrates a link
between C1QBP and p38 MAPK (Figure 4F and
Supplementary Figure S4E). Moreover, a previous
study demonstrated that p38 MAPK acts as a sensor
of ROS during tumorigenesis and apoptosis [44].
To investigate whether C1QBP influences p38
MAPK pathway activation upon H2O2 treatment, the
phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and its downstream
target MAPKAPK-2 was measured by western blot.
As shown in Figure 5A, overexpression of C1QBP
inhibited the H2O2-induced phosphorylation of p38
MAPK and MAPKAPK-2 compared with endogenous

ZNF32 deficiency augments the anti-tumor effect

with SB203580, followed by treatment with 0.5 mM
H2O2 for 24 h. Interestingly, overexpression of ZNF32
combined with SB203580 pretreatment resulted in
reduced apoptosis and increased cell viability compared
with ZNF32 overexpression or SB203580 treatment
alone (Supplementary Figures S6D and S6E). Taken
together, our results show that oxidative stress further
activates the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in ZNF32and C1QBP-deficient cells and suggest that the ZNF32C1QBP axis participates in the regulation of oxidative
stress-induced apoptosis at least partially via the p38
MAPK pathway.

As the results presented above suggested that ZNF32
regulates cell survival upon oxidative stress in vitro, we
investigated whether ZNF32 influences the effect of the
pro-oxidant drug PL on HepG2 cells in vivo. Knockdown of
ZNF32 slightly accelerated tumor xenograft growth in DMSOtreated control mice (Figures 6A–6C). However, PL treatment
caused a remarkable reduction in tumor weight and volume
for xenografts derived from ZNF32-silenced cells compared
to those from control cells. These findings were confirmed by

in 19 paired samples (Figures 7A and 7B); these results
suggest that ZNF32 expression is positively correlated
with C1QBP expression. Moreover, our data indicated no
apparent association between ZNF32 expression and age,
sex, stage, HBV infection, or fibrosis. Intriguingly, the
expression of ZNF32 was lower in 14 out of the 15 HCC
samples exhibiting necrosis than in the matched normal
hepatic tissue samples (p = 0.003, Figure 7C). In addition,
increased expression of ZNF32 significantly correlated with
poor differentiation (p = 0.012, Figure 7D).

with C1QBP expression and is associated with

We next examined the expression of ZNF32 and its
downstream target C1QBP in HCC samples. A total of 50
paired primary human HCC and adjacent normal hepatic
tissue samples were collected. The clinicopathological
characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 2.
Compared to the matched normal hepatic tissues, the HCC
tissues displayed a significant decrease in ZNF32 and
C1QBP expression in 29 and 20 of the cases, respectively.
Notably, co-expression of ZNF32 and C1QBP was observed
in 39 of the 50 paired samples (78%), including coupregulation in 20 paired samples and co-downregulation

DISCUSSION
The regulation of redox homeostasis is fundamental
to maintaining normal cellular functions and promoting
cell survival. Accompanied with a higher ROS level
than normal cells, cancer cells characteristically develop
several adaptive responses to maintain ROS levels that

are compatible with cellular biological functions. Thus,
interferences in ROS homeostasis are believed to be
capable of disrupting cancer cell biological metabolism
and efficiently inducing cell death [17, 18]. For example,
PGC1α reduces the generation of mitochondrial-driven
ROS to promote survival under oxidative stress conditions,
and the pro-oxidant drugs PL and PEITC show markedly
increased potency in PGC1α-deficient melanoma
cells [45]. In the present study, we report that ZNF32
suppresses ROS accumulation and MDA formation and
rescues mitochondrial membrane potential and catalase
activity to enable cell survival under oxidative stress.
Conversely, ZNF32-deficient cells are more sensitive
and vulnerable to oxidative stress. In tumor xenografts,
knockdown of ZNF32 markedly increased the potency of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the pro-oxidant drug PL (Figure 6), leading to enhanced
tumor suppression.
KLF includes a set of zinc finger DNA-binding
proteins that are involved in cell proliferation and
apoptosis via the regulation of gene expression [46, 47].
ZNF32 was recently identified as a novel KLF, and its
downstream targets have rarely been reported in the
literature. Here, we demonstrate that ZNF32 regulates
C1QBP expression by directly binding to the C1QBP
promoter, where the transcriptional activity of ZNF32 is
suppressed by toxic doses of H2O2 (Figures 4C and 4D).
Moreover, depletion of C1QBP reverses the protective
effect of ZNF32 against H2O2-induced mitochondrial
dysfunction; this finding suggests that C1QBP is
essential for ZNF32 to sustain the mitochondrial
38118

Oncotarget

membrane potential and ROS homeostasis and to resist
apoptosis in response to oxidative stress (Figures 4F–4J).
In line with our findings, McGee and his colleague have
reported that neither overexpression nor knockdown
of C1QBP alters mitochondrial function at baseline.
However, overexpression of C1QBP in mitochondria
greatly suppresses oxidative stress-induced mPTP
opening and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas
depletion of C1QBP exerts the opposite effect and
instead sensitizes cells to H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and
cell death [40]. Further support for these conclusions is
based on the observation that the loss of C1QBP does not
significantly decrease cell viability but does negatively
impact the survival of cells treated with cisplatin, a
well-documented pro-oxidant agent [48]. Thus, our
data suggest that ZNF32 acts as a stress-responsive
factor to control intracellular ROS accumulation and
cell susceptibility to oxidative stress via the regulation
of C1QBP transcription and mitochondrial membrane
potential.
Despite the essential role of ZNF32 in ROS
homeostasis, it is necessary to understand the mechanism
by which ZNF32 is regulated in response to oxidative
stress. Here, we demonstrate that Sp1 specifically
and directly binds to two GC boxes within the ZNF32
promoter and that the binding activity of Sp1 is
regulated by different concentrations of H2O2 (Figure
1 and Supplementary Figure S1). Sp1 is a redoxregulated transcription factor that can act as an antideath transcription factor by regulating the expression of
various target genes, such as the Kv1.5 potassium channel
gene and insulin receptor substrate 2 [49, 50]. Notably,
low doses (0.1 and 0.25 mM) of or acute exposure (from
1 h to 4 h) to H2O2 increased the Sp1-mediated expression
of ZNF32, whereas high doses of H2O2 (0.5 mM for
24 h) repressed ZNF32 transcription by inhibiting the
binding activity of Sp1 (Supplementary Figure S1). This
phenomenon could be explained by the kinetics of Sp1
activation: Sp1-DNA binding is an “early” and protective
response to oxidative stress that is inhibited when cells
become irreversibly “committed” to the apoptotic or
senescence pathway [51–54]. Thus, ZNF32 acts as a
downstream target of Sp1 and mediates the protective
role of Sp1 under oxidative stress.
The evidence from our study provides the
basis for a model of ZNF32-dependent regulation of
apoptosis in response to oxidative stress (Figure 8).
Upon the elevation of ROS levels, Sp1 binds to the
ZNF32 promoter and augments ZNF32 transcription.
Subsequently, C1QBP expression is increased by ZNF32
to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential, activate
antioxidant defenses, and consequently reduce the ROS
levels to amounts that are not detrimental to cell survival.
However, when cells are subjected to excessive oxidative
stress above the critical threshold, the expression of
ZNF32 is repressed by decreased DNA-binding activity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of Sp1, leading to C1QBP downregulation, mitochondrial
dysfunction and antioxidant system impairment and
ultimately resulting in extreme ROS accumulation,
p38 MAPK pathway activation, and cell death. As
growing cancer cells in vivo are typically subjected to
mild oxidative stress, including hypoxia and altered
metabolism, ZNF32 performs an important function in the
protection of cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis,
and this function enables cell survival and proliferation.
Moreover, increased expression of ZNF32 was
significantly associated with poor differentiation in clinical
HCC samples, and these results suggest that ZNF32
contributes to the malignant progression of HCC. With
the development of tumors, insufficient vascular perfusion
causes injurious conditions, such as excessively low pH
and nutrient deprivation, and serious oxidative stress in the
local tumor microenvironment. These events may result
in the suppression of ZNF32 transcription, leading to the
impairment of the antioxidant system and, ultimately, cell
death. Consistently, we showed that low expression of
ZNF32 was significantly associated with the necrosis of
tumor areas in clinical HCC samples. Additional evidence
indicates that the pathways underlying stress adaptations
may represent the most critical weak point in most tumors.
Therefore, molecules that mediate such adaptations, rather
than oncogenes and tumor suppressors, could be the next
important targets for future anticancer drug discovery
studies [17, 55, 56]. ZNF32 increases the threshold for
oxidative stress-induced cell death. This finding suggests
that ZNF32 or one of its target genes could serve as a
therapeutic target for cancer treatment. For HCC patients
with high ZNF32 expression, ZNF32 inhibition combined
with agents that induce oxidative stress represent an
efficient strategy for killing cancer cells. Future studies
aimed at assessing which transcription factor partners
with ZNF32 to control mitochondrial metabolism, the
antioxidant system and the tumor microenvironment will
help us to more precisely elucidate the role of ZNF32 in
tumor progression and therapy.
In conclusion, our study delineates the molecular
mechanisms underlying the ZNF32-dependent regulation
of apoptosis in response to oxidative stress. The Sp1mediated transcriptional control of ZNF32 is strongly
associated with cell fate in response to the different
levels of ROS. The expression of ZNF32 protects against
oxidative stress-induced apoptosis via enhanced C1QBP
transcription, which maintains mitochondrial membrane
potential, followed by inactivation of the p38 MAPK
pathway. In contrast, depletion of ZNF32 increases the
oxidative damage caused by pro-oxidant agents and
enhances tumor suppression both in vitro and in vivo.
Taken together, our data suggest a novel mechanism by
which the Sp1-ZNF32-C1QBP axis resists oxidative
stress, and we propose that ZNF32 may serve as a
therapeutic target to enhance the sensitivity of cancer to
pro-oxidant agents.

Figure 8: A model for the ZNF32-dependent regulation of ROS homeostasis and apoptosis in response to oxidative
stress. (Left) Upon exposure to moderate oxidative stress, Sp1 binds to the ZNF32 promoter to increase ZNF32 transcription, which, in
turn, increases C1QBP expression, maintains the mitochondrial membrane potential and antioxidant capacity, and inactivates the p38 MAPK
pathway, consequently promoting cell survival. (Right) Under excessive oxidative stress, Sp1 is displaced from the ZNF32 promoter, which
prevents ZNF32 expression, followed by the suppression of C1QBP transcription, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, extreme ROS
accumulation, activation of p38 MAPK pathway and, ultimately, cell death.

Oxidative damage to lipids

Dual luciferase reporter assay
For cotransfection, HEK293 cells were transfected
with 0.25 μg of a ZNF32 promoter reporter construct and
0.05 μg of pRL-TK with or without 0.75 μg of pCGNSp1 using 2 μl of TurboFect per well in 48-well plates.
Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were rinsed
twice with PBS and incubated in medium containing 0.5
mM H2O2 for an additional 24 hours. The cells were then
lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer, and luciferase activity was
measured in the cell lysates. The dual-luciferase reporter
assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega) using a Multi-Mode Microplate
Reader (Synergy 2, BioTek).

MDA, a secondary product of lipid peroxidation,
was measured using the MDA assay kit (Jiancheng
Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). Cell culture
supernatants were used because it had been shown that
MDA is almost completely released into the culture
medium within 1 h after production [58]. Briefly,
the hydrolysate of lipoperoxides was reacted with
thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in a 95°C water bath for 40 min
to yield a red MDA-TBA adduct. Supernatants containing
the MDA-TBA adduct were measured at 532 nm using a
microplate spectrophotometer (uQuant MQX200, BioTek).
The concentration of MDA was calculated according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

EMSAs

Measurement of intracellular ROS

Nuclear protein extracts were prepared using NEPER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents
(Thermo) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Approximately 10 μg of nuclear extract was incubated in
5′-end biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides.
The binding reaction was performed for 20 minutes at
room temperature using the LightShift Chemiluminescent
EMSA Kit (Thermo). To resolve protein-DNA complexes,
the reaction mix was separated on a 5% nondenaturing
gel in 0.5 × Tris-borate EDTA. The gel was transferred
to a positively charged nylon membrane (Millipore), and
the membrane was developed using the Chemiluminescent
Nucleic Acid Detection Module (Thermo) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. For competition assays,
nuclear extracts were incubated in a 200-fold molar excess
of unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides.

To assess the generation of intracellular ROS, cells
were washed with DMEM twice and then incubated in
5 μM DCFH-DA (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute,
Nanjing, China) at 37°C for 30 min. The cells were
washed with PBS three times and lysed in lysis buffer after
incubation. Then, the fluorescence intensity was measured
using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL microplate fluorometer
(Thermo) with excitation and emission settings of 485 nm
and 530 nm, respectively.

Measurement of catalase activity
Catalase activity was determined using assay kits
for catalase according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).
The results were presented as specific activity, which was
calculated as the total activity per sample divided by the
total amount of protein per sample.

ChIP assays
ChIP assays were performed using the EZ-Magna
ChIP™ A kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Aliquots of chromatin immunoprecipitation
lysates were diluted and incubated in the indicated antibody
and protein A magnetic beads at 4°C for 2 h. The beads

Flow cytometric analysis
Apoptotic cells were quantified via Annexin V-FITC
and PI double-staining using a staining kit from KeyGEN
Biotech (Nanjing, China). Briefly, cells were trypsinized

2-DE and MS/MS analysis

with trypsin, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in
200 μl of binding buffer containing 2 μl of Annexin V-FITC
and 2 μl of PI and incubated at room temperature for 15
min. Then, the cell mixture was immediately analyzed
using a flow cytometer (FACSAria, Becton Dickinson).
The mitochondrial membrane potential was
measured using a mitochondria-specific dual fluorescence
probe, JC-1 (Beyotime), as described previously [59].
Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and loaded
with JC-1-containing solution for 30 min at 37°C. JC-1
fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry, in which
red JC-1 aggregates were gated in the FL2 channel and
green JC-1 monomers in the FL1 channel. Analysis of the
multivariate data was performed using FlowJo software.

2-DE-based proteomic analysis was performed
as described previously [61]. Briefly, the indicated cells
were dissolved in lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea,
4% CHAPS, 100 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2% pH 3–10
ampholyte) in the presence of protease inhibitor. Samples
were loaded on IPG strips (17 cm, pH3–10NL, BIO-RAD)
using a passive rehydration method and then subjected to
isoelectric focusing (BIO-RAD). Separation in the second
dimension was performed using 12% SDS-PAGE. The
gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250
(BIO-RAD). In-gel protein digestion was performed using
MS-grade trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Gel spots were destained
with 100 mM NH4HCO3/50% acetonitrile (ACN) and then
dehydrated with 100% ACN. The gels were then incubated
in trypsin, followed by double extraction with 50%
ACN/5% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide extracts were
dried in a speed-VAC concentrator (Thermo) and subjected
to mass spectrometric analysis using a Q-TOF mass
spectrometer (Micromass, UK) fitted with an ESI source.

Tumor xenograft experiments
For these experiments, 6-week-old BALB/c
nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated in the flank
region with either 5 × 106 shZNF32-HepG2 cells or
5 × 106 shNC-HepG2 cells. When the diameter of HepG2
tumors reached approximately 3 mm, the tumor-bearing
mice were randomly selected for treatment with DMSO
control or PL (2.5 mg/kg/day) via intraperitoneal injection
for 15 days. The tumor size was measured every 3 days
until the mice were sacrificed. The tumor volume was
calculated using the following formula: tumor volume
(mm3) = π/6 × length × width2. The tumors were weighed
after the mice were sacrificed. All animals received
humane care according to the Institutional Animal Care
and Treatment Committee of Sichuan University.

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the means ± SEM. To
evaluate the significance of the differences between two
groups, the means were compared using Student’s t test.
Multiple-group comparisons were performed via one-way
analysis of variance. The data were analyzed using SPSS
statistical software version 22.0. p < 0.05 was considered
to be significant.

TUNEL assay

Abbreviations

The in situ cell death assay was performed
using a TUNEL kit (Promega) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. The slides were observed
under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co.,
Hamburg, Germany), and a nucleus displaying bright
green fluorescent staining was recorded as a TUNELpositive cell. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was
counted in 5 independent randomly selected fields. These
values were expressed as the percentage of positive cells
relative to the total number of cells.
