BACKGROUND: Granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is effective in accelerating neutrophil recovery after
intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the optimal G-CSF dosage for patients with
AML has not been determined. To the authors’ knowledge, G-CSF dosages have not been compared in a randomized
AML study. METHODS: Patients who were enrolled on the St. Jude AML97 protocol and remained on study after window therapy were eligible to participate. The effect of the dosage of G-CSF given after induction chemotherapy
Courses 1 and 2 was analyzed in 46 patients who were assigned randomly in a double-blinded manner to receive either 5 lg/kg daily or 10 lg/kg daily of G-CSF. The number of days of G-CSF treatment, neutropenia (an absolute neutrophil count <0.5  109/L), and hospitalization; the number of episodes of febrile neutropenia, grade 2 through 4
infection, and antimicrobial therapy; transfusion requirements; the cost of supportive care; and survival were compared between the 2 study arms. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 arms
in any of the endpoints measured. CONCLUSIONS: The higher G-CSF dosage (10 lg/kg daily) offered no greater benefit than the lower dosage (5 lg/kg daily) in patients who were receiving intensive chemotherapy for AML. Cancer

KEYWORDS: acute myeloid leukemia, granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor, dosage, children, randomized trial.

Intensive chemotherapy1-4 and advances in supportive care5,6 have improved the rates of remission and long-term
survival in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is effective in
accelerating neutrophil recovery in patients who are receiving intensive chemotherapy for AML.7,8 In several adult AML
studies, prophylactic use of 5 lg/kg daily of G-CSF after induction and consolidation therapy reduced the duration of
neutropenia, infection, and antibiotic use.9-11 However, the duration of febrile episodes, the frequency of documented
infection, the duration of hospitalization, and overall survival were not affected. It is unknown whether higher doses can
extend the benefits of G-CSF beyond reduction of the duration of neutropenia.
G-CSF generally has been used at doses of 10 lg/kg daily or more in the setting of autologous bone marrow stem
cell collection12,13; however, to our knowledge, no studies to date have compared different dosages of G-CSF in patients
who are receiving chemotherapy for AML. Herein, we report the results from a randomized, double-blind trial that compared the effects of 2 different doses (5 lg/kg daily and 10 lg/kg daily) of G-CSF after induction treatment in children
with newly diagnosed AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between March 1997 and June 2002, 102 children with
previously untreated AML or myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) were enrolled on the single-institution AML97
protocol at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.3
Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were not
eligible. The protocol was amended in May 1999 to compare the effects of 2 dosages of G-CSF given after remission induction chemotherapy. Patients who were enrolled
on AML97 and remained on study after window therapy
were eligible.
The study design specified double-blind, random
assignment of at least 36 patients to receive G-CSF (filgrastim) at 5 lg/kg daily or 10 lg/kg daily intravenously
after induction Courses 1 and 2. This number would provide 90% power to detect a 5-day difference in the number of neutropenic days (primary outcome measure) at an
alpha level of .05 (1-sided test). Secondary outcomes that
were compared between treatment arms were the number
of days of G-CSF treatment and hospitalization; the cumulative number of febrile neutropenia episodes, episodes
of grade 2 through 4 infection, antibiotic therapy courses,
intravenous antibiotic therapy courses, and antifungal
therapy courses; the number of erythrocyte and platelet
transfusions; the cost of supportive care; and estimates of
event-free survival and survival. The study was approved
by the St. Jude Institutional Review Board, and signed
informed consent was obtained from patients, parents, or
guardians, as appropriate.

Therapy
The AML97 treatment protocol has been described previously.3 Briefly, patients who agreed to participate in
‘‘upfront window’’ therapy were assigned randomly to
receive either 5 daily, short infusions (2-hour) of cytarabine (500 mg/m2 daily; Arm A) or a 5-day, continuous
infusion of cytarabine (500 mg/m2 daily; Arm B); both
arms received 5 daily 30-minute infusions of cladribine (9
mg/m2). Induction chemotherapy Courses 1 and 2 comprised daunorubicin (30 mg/m2 daily as a continuous
infusion on Days 1-3), cytarabine (250 mg/m2 daily as a
continuous infusion on Days 1-5), and etoposide (200
mg/m2 daily as a continuous infusion on Days 4 and 5)
(DAV1 and DAV2, respectively). Patients with high-risk
AML (megakaryoblastic leukemia; refractory anemia with
excess blasts in transformation; secondary AML; AML
with -7, 5q-, or t(9,22) translocation; or persistent leuke-

1314

mia after DAV1) were eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after DAV2.
Patients with the t(8;21) or the inv(16) erase were classified with low-risk AML and were not eligible for allogeneic HSCT. All other patients were classified with
standard-risk AML and were eligible for HSCT if a
matched sibling donor was available. Patients who did not
undergo allogeneic HSCT received 2 courses of consolidation chemotherapy, which consisted of cytarabine (3 g/
m2 daily every 12 hours on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9) and L-asparaginase (6000 U/m2 after the fourth and eighth doses
of cytarabine) followed by mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 daily
on Days 1-5) and cytarabine (1 g/m2/ daily every 12 hours
on Days 1-3).
All patients received 1 intrathecal treatment with
cytarabine at diagnosis. Patients without central nervous
system (CNS) disease received 4 triple-intrathecal chemotherapy treatments with methotrexate, hydrocortisone,
and cytarabine (with doses adjusted based on age) beginning during DAV1. Patients with CNS leukemia received
triple-intrathecal therapy weekly until the cerebrospinal
fluid was clear of leukemia cells (minimum, 4 doses), and
then they received 4 additional doses.
Random Assignment to G-CSF Dosage
After May 1999, patients were assigned randomly before
the start of DAV1 to receive 5 lg/kg daily or 10 lg/kg
daily of intravenous G-CSF after DAV1 and DAV2.
Daily 30-minute G-CSF intravenous infusions began 24
hours after the last day of each chemotherapy cycle and
continued until the absolute neutrophil count remained
0.5  109/L for 2 days. The next chemotherapy cycle
was started at least 24 hours after discontinuation of GCSF. G-CSF was not administered to patients who were
scheduled to undergo HSCT after DAV2 or to patients
who had a poor response to DAV1 and, thus, were taken
off of the AML97 protocol.
Statistical Analysis
Patient features were compared between G-CSF treatment arms by using the exact chi-square test. Outcome
variables were measured during the period beginning
with the end of each DAV course and ending with the
start of the subsequent chemotherapy course. The median number of days of G-CSF treatment in the 2 arms
was compared separately for each induction cycle by
using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A repeated-measures,
mixed-effects model based on normal distribution was

used to analyze the effect of G-CSF dosage on the number of days of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count
>0.5  109/L) and hospitalization and on the cost of
supportive care, adjusting for chemotherapy course effect
and modeling the correlation with an autoregressive
structure.14 The supportive care charges in DAV1 and
DAV2 were divided into 6 categories: antimicrobial
agents, laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging tests, room/
procedure charges, transfusion charges, and other general supportive care. The charges during induction therapy were calculated and log-transformed. Proportional
means models were used to compare the cumulative
number of febrile neutropenia episodes, episodes of
grade 2 through 4 infection (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0),
antibiotic therapy courses, intravenous antibiotic therapy
courses, antifungal therapy courses, and erythrocyte and
platelet transfusions with G-CSF treatment as fixed
covariate.15
Event-free survival was defined as the time between
G-CSF randomization and disease recurrence, death, secondary malignancy, or last follow-up. Remission induction failure was treated as an event at Time 0. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the probability of event-free survival and survival; standard errors were
determined according to the method of Peto et al.16 Survival distributions were compared by using the MantelHaenszel log-rank test.17 All analyses were performed
using SAS software for Windows version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and StatXact for Windows version 7.1
(Cytel Corporation, Cambridge, Mass).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of 55 patients who were approached for enrollment, 5
patients declined, and 3 patients did not remain on the
protocol after window therapy. Forty-seven patients were
assigned randomly to receive G-CSF 5 lg/kg daily or 10
lg/kg daily. One patient was excluded from analysis
because of treatment with granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor at the physician’s discretion; 46
patients were analyzed for DAV1, and 36 patients were
analyzed for DAV2. The median patient age was 9.03
years (range, 0.05-21 years), and the median white blood
cell count was 12.3  109/L (range, 1.2-166.8  109/L).
Patient characteristics did not differ significantly according to G-CSF arm (Table 1).

Duration of G-CSF Treatment and
Neutropenia
There were no significant differences between the 2 GCSF treatment arms in the duration of G-CSF treatment
after DAV1 or DAV2 (Table 2). The number of neutropenic days also did not differ significantly in the 2 treatment arms (Table 2).
Episodes of Febrile Neutropenia and
Infection and Days of Hospitalization
There was no evidence that the number of febrile neutropenic episodes or episodes of grade 2 through 4 infection
differed significantly between the 5 lg/kg daily and
10 lg/kg daily G-CSF arms (Table 2, Fig. 1A,B). The
number of hospitalization days also did not differ significantly between the 2 arms (Table 2).
Episodes of Antibiotic and Antifungal
Therapy
There was no evidence that the 5 lg/kg daily G-CSF arm
differed significantly from the 10 lg/kg daily G-CSF arm
in the number of antibiotic therapy courses, intravenous
antibiotic therapy courses, or antifungal therapy courses
(Table 2).
Transfusions
The number of erythrocyte and platelet transfusions did
not differ significantly between the 2 G-CSF arms (Table
2).
Cost of Supportive Care
We observed no evidence that patients who received 5 lg/
kg daily G-CSF differed significantly from those who
received 10 lg/kg daily G-CSF with regard to total supportive care costs or any of the 6 categories of supportive
care costs (Table 2).
Event-Free and Overall Survival
We observed no significant differences between the 5 lg/
kg daily and 10 lg/kg daily G-CSF arms in the proportion of complete responses (Table 1) or in estimates of
event-free survival or overall survival. The 6-year eventfree survival estimate was 52.2%  10% for patients who
received 5 lg/kg daily G-CSF and 39.1%  9.7% for
patients who received 10 lg/kg daily G-CSF (P ¼ .43)
(Fig. 2). The 6-year survival estimate was 65.2%  9.6%
for patients who received 5 lg/kg daily G-CSF and
52.2%  11.4% for patients who received 10 lg/kg daily
G-CSF (P ¼ .45).

DISCUSSION
Our prospective, randomized trial of 2 dosages of prophylactic G-CSF (5 lg/kg daily vs 10 lg/kg daily) in children
who were receiving intensive induction chemotherapy for
AML indicated that there was no significant difference in
any of the outcomes measured. We acknowledge that statistical power for secondary outcomes may have been limited. However, to our knowledge, the current trial is
the first randomized study comparing different dose of
G-CSF in AML.
Several adult studies have demonstrated that G-CSF
can modestly reduce (by 5-6 days) the duration of neutropenia when it is started shortly after induction chemotherapy.9,10,18,19 However, it is not clear whether this
acceleration of neutrophil recovery is clinically meaningful. Endpoints such as duration of hospitalization and frequency of severe infection have been reduced only
occasionally and modestly. Furthermore, in the majority
of studies, growth factor therapy did not alter the likelihood of complete remission, disease-free survival, or overall survival.
The Berlin-Frankfurt-Munich (BFM) 98 study randomly assigned children with AML to receive G-CSF (5
lg/kg daily) or no G-CSF starting on Day 15 of the first
and second induction therapy courses.20 The duration of
neutropenia in their trial was significantly less in the GCSF arm after the first induction course (cytarabine, idarubicin, and etoposide; median, 18 days vs 23 days; P ¼
.02) and after the second induction course (cytarabine
and mitoxantrone; 11 days vs 16 days; P ¼ .0005), but
the duration of thrombocytopenia, the frequency of grade
3 and 4 infection, and 5-year event-free survival did not
differ significantly between the arms. In another pediatric
AML study, Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) 2891,
patients who received intensive chemotherapy and 5 lg/
kg daily of G-CSF were compared with historic controls
who received similar treatment but without G-CSF.21
Although the duration of neutropenia, number of hospital
days, and delays in planned therapy in that study were
reduced significantly, the frequency of severe infection
and estimates of event-free survival and survival were not
affected.
Studies in healthy hematopoietic stem cell donors
who received G-CSF suggest a correlation between the
G-CSF dose and the level of circulating CD34 positive
progenitor cells 4 to 7 days after administration.12,13 All
volunteers who received 10 lg/kg daily and underwent a
single leukapheresis mobilized more than the minimum
target number of stem cells, whereas volunteers who

received lower daily doses of G-CSF did not consistently
mobilize as many cells.12 However, the higher G-CSF
dose did not have a comparable effect in patients who
were undergoing autologous stem cell harvest after cytotoxic chemotherapy, probably because of their limited
number of progenitor cells.22 Similarly, higher daily doses
of G-CSF (range, 2-16 lg/kg) did not induce a greater
improvement in neutrophil recovery than lower doses in

our results, which failed to demonstrate any benefit provided by the higher G-CSF dose of 10 lg/kg daily.
Although we observed no statistically significant difference between the study arms in event-free survival or
survival, both estimates were lower in patients who
received 10 lg/kg daily. Increased relative expression of
the Class IV G-CSF receptor isoform in AML uncouples

the proliferative and maturational G-CSF receptor signaling pathways, and higher doses of G-CSF may enhance
this effect.26,27 In the BFM 98 study, patients with standard-risk AML that overexpressed the maturation-defective
G-CSF receptor isoform IV had a significantly higher
incidence of recurrence with G-CSF treatment.28 Further
studies of the function and expression patterns of G-CSF
receptor and its isoforms in AML cells are warranted.
Improved supportive care is likely to enhance treatment outcome in patients who are receiving AML therapy.1,5,6 The lower rate of early death in recent BFMAML trials than in previous trials probably reflects both
experience and improved supportive care.5 However, infectious mortality, particularly that caused by invasive
bacterial and fungal infections, remains unacceptably

high.29,30 We recently reported that the routine prophylactic use of 1) vancomycin, oral ciprofloxacin or
cephalosporin, and voriconazole or 2) cefepime and voriconazole reduced morbidity and dramatically decreased
the incidence of septicemia and the number of hospital
days.14 Improved 3-year event-free survival (63% 
4.1%) and survival (71.1%  3.8%) in our recent multiinstitutional AML02 study may be attributed in part to
better supportive care.31 Likewise, the excellent survival
rates in the Japanese Childhood AML Cooperative Study
Group (5-year event-free survival, 61.6%; survival,
75.6%) were associated with routine inpatient care
throughout the treatment course, allowing close patient
monitoring and ready access to antibiotics.4
In conclusion, we suggest that first priority be given
to the use of prophylactic antibiotics and close patient
monitoring (by inpatient care or frequent outpatient visits) and that growth factors (eg, G-CSF 5 lg/kg daily)
should be reserved for patients with extremely prolonged
neutropenia and/or clinically complicated infection,
ideally after confirming the expression pattern of G-CSF
receptor isoform IV in AML cells. A recent survey of
Children’s Oncology Group and BFM group institutions
revealed systematic differences in infection-related supportive care practices for pediatric AML patients.6 To
improve supportive care in AML, harmonized use and/or
randomized studies of antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis and criteria for growth factor use and for discharge after chemotherapy are needed.
