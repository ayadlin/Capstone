BACKGROUND. Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) functions as a drug efflux
transporter that mediates drug resistance. Topoisomerase I inhibitors, including
7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), are substrates effluxed by BCRP. However, it remains unclear whether the overexpression of BCRP induces drug resistance during chemotherapy. The objectives of the current study were to examine
a correlation of altered promoter methylation of BCRP with BCRP expression and
to investigate the correlation between methylation status according to methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) analysis and BCRP expression
levels in several small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.

METHODS. Non-BCRP-expressing PC-6 cells, which were sensitive to SN-38, were
treated with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor to induce BCRP re-expression by
means of reverse transcriptase-polymersae chain reaction, Western blot, and flow
cytometric analyses. Subsequently, bisulfite sequencing analysis in both PC-6

hemotherapy is the mainstay in treatment for various types of
advanced cancer. However, it has been recognized that even
highly sensitive cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and small
cell lung cancer, frequently exhibit drug resistance during the course
of chemotherapy. The development of resistance to a single anticancer drug is accompanied by cross-resistance to several anticancer
drugs and reduces the effectiveness of chemotherapy. This phenom-

enon is referred to as multidrug resistance (MDR).1
Thus, it is very important to overcome drug resistance and to elucidate its mechanisms, thus leading
to better treatment for various cancers. One of the
well known molecular mechanisms of drug resistance is to enhance extrusion of drugs and their
metabolites by overexpression of energy-dependent
pumps, such as adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.2–4 ABC transporters are
classified into 7 subfamilies (A through G), and it is
well known that several transporters are correlated
with drug resistance: P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the MDR 1 gene (MDR1),5,6 the MDRassociated proteins (MRPs),7,8 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).9,10
BCRP, a novel member of the G (white) subfamily of ABC transporters, was newly identified as an
over expressing molecule in MCF-7/doxorubicin-verapamil cells.9 BCRP is a 655 amino-acid polypeptide
at 72 kD and is localized at the plasma membrane.11,12 The anticancer drugs that are effluxed by
BCRP are mitoxantrone, anthracyclines, and topotecan-derived and topoisomerase I inhibitors, including 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) (an
active metabolite of irinotecan) and methotrexate.10,13–17 Moreover, because it is expressed physiologically in the placenta, bile canaliculi, colon, small
intestine, and brain microvessel endothelium, BCRP
may play a role in protecting the organism from
potentially harmful xenobiotics in normal and cancer
cells.9 In our previous study, BCRP was not expressed
in human small cell lung cancer PC-6 cells but was
overexpressed in the SN-38-resistant subline, PC-6/
SN2-5H, which was selected from PC-6 cells by continuous exposure to SN-38.15 In addition, the antisense oligonucleotide significantly suppressed BCRP
expression and enhanced the sensitivity to SN-38 in
PC-6/SN2-5H cells, indicating that BCRP re-expression directly confers SN-38 resistance.15 However, the
precise mechanisms underlying BCRP re-expression
during acquisition of drug resistance remain unclear.
DNA methylation is a covalent modification of
cytosine and is recognized as an epigenetic DNA
modification in mammalian cells. It occurs at CpG
dinucleotides by DNA methyltransferases. Approximately 70% to 80% of CpG sites are methylated with
the notable exception of CpG-rich sequences,
referred to as CpG islands, which generally are
unmethylated and are located in the promoter
region. It has been demonstrated that methylation of
CpG islands in the promoter region of certain genes
causes their transcriptional silencing in normal and
malignant cells.18–21 Demethylation of CpG islands in
the promoter region of MDR1 induces re-expression

1123

and overexpression of P-gp and demonstrates
the MDR phenotype.22–26 These findings indicate
that P-gp overexpression induced by demethylation
of the MDR1 promoter is a mechanism of acquisition
of drug resistance during chemotherapy.
From analogy to P-gp re-expression by demethylation of the MDR1 promoter, we hypothesize that
promoter demethylation of BCRP may induce BCRP
re-expression in drug-resistant lung cancer cells,
leading to SN-38 resistance. Therefore, the objective
of this study was to investigate whether altered
methylation status of CpG sites in the promoter
region of BCRP in PC-6 cells and PC-6/SN2-5H cells
is correlated with BCRP re-expression at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels and whether
methylation status analyzed by methylation-specific
polymerase chain reaction (MSP) method also is correlated with BCRP mRNA expression levels in both
small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
SN-38-resistant PC-6/SN2-5H cells were selected
from parental PC-6 human small cell lung cancer
cells by continuous exposure to SN-38, as reported
previously.27 All other unselected human nonsmall
cell lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H69, NCI-H358, NCIH441, and NCI-H460) were obtained from American
TypeCulture Collection (Manassas, Va). PC-6/SN2-5H
cells over express BCRP and have highly functional
efflux-pump activity, indicating high resistance to
SN-38.15,28 NCI-H358, NCI-H441, and NCI-H460 cells
have moderate expression and functional pump activity of BCRP and demonstrate moderate to low resistance to SN-38.28 Conversely, PC-6 and NCI-H69
cells never express BCRP and have high sensitivity to
SN-38.15,28 PC-6/SN2-5H cells have no mutations of
BCRP (for example, homozygous wild-type alleles at
codons 376, 421, and 482) and no 944-949 deletions,
which alter the substrate specificity of BCRP.29–32
Cells were cultured at 37 8C under a humidified
atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), 10% fetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen), 200 mM glutamine (Invitrogen),
and 250 lg/mL kanamycin (Meiji Seika, Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan). All other reagents were purchased from
Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, Mo).
DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor Treatment of PC-6 Cells
and BCRP Expression Analysis
PC-6 cells were incubated in RPMI-1640 with various
concentrations of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor,

Company). After culture for 24 hours, cells were treated with 0 lM, 0.1 lM, 0.5 lM, 1 lM, or 2 lM 5-azadC for 72 hours. Cells were harvested, and total RNA
was isolated from each cell by using ISOGEN (Nippongene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction
was performed on 3.5 lg of total RNA with random
hexamer by using the Thermoscript RT-polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) system (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR primer sequences for BCRP were described previously.15 The
human b-actin gene (ACTB) was used as an internal
control to normalize expression of BCRP. The PCR
primer sequences for ACTB were as follows: 50 AAGATGACCCAGATCATGTTTGAG-30 (sense primer)
and 50 -AGGAGGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTT-30 (antisense primer). PCR was performed in a 25-lL reaction
mixture
that
contained
aliquots
of
combinational DNA solution; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.4; 50 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl2; 200 lM dinucleotide
triphosphate (dNTP) (Promega, Madison, Wis); 0.6
lM each of the sense and antisense primers; and
1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with a DNA
thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9700; Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) according to the following protocol: for BCRP, initial denaturation at 94
8C for 2 minutes; 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 8C
for 90 seconds, annealing at 63 8C for 60 seconds,
and extension at 72 8C for 60 seconds; and final
extension at 72 8C for 5 minutes; and, for ACTB, initial denaturation at 94 8C for 2 minutes; 27 cycles of
denaturation at 94 8C for 30 seconds, annealing at 57
8C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72 8C for 30 seconds; and final extension at 72 8C for 5 minutes. PCR
products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose-ME
gel (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), observed with an
ultraviolet transilluminator (Alpha Innotech, San
Leandro, Calif) after ethidium bromide (Invitrogen)
staining, and photographed. The signal intensity of
each PCR product was estimated by using the Image
Gauge 4.0 program (Fuji Photo Film Company, Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan). To represent the relative BCRP mRNA
expression level, we used the following formula: the
signal intensity of BCRP divided by that of ACTB.

Western Blot Analysis of BCRP
Whole cell proteins from PC-6, PC-6/SN2-5H, and
PC-6 cells with exposure to 1 lM 5-aza-dC for 72
hours were obtained, and 15 lg of protein from each
lane were separated on a 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described
previously.28 By using BXP-21 (Kamiya, Seattle, Wash)
of antihuman BCRP antibody (1:500) and the ECL

detection system (Amersham, Bucks, U.K.), Western
blot analysis was performed as described previously.28

Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometric analysis was performed as described
previously.28,33 Because topotecan is one of the substrates that is effluxed by BCRP and has intrinsic fluorescent properties that are detectable by using a
conventional flow cytometer,28,33 cultured cells
(approximately 2 3 106) were exposed to 30 lM
topotecan for 15 minutes at 37 8C with or without
300 lM novobiocin, which is a good substrate for
BCRP and inhibits its function competitively (topotecan transport by BCRP was inhibited by 75% under
160 lM novobiocin),33 then washed twice in ice-cold
saline. Fluorescence of topotecan was measured
through a 488-nanometer (nm) band-pass filter at an
excitation wavelength of 585 nm by using a FACscan
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View,
Calif) equipped with a 15 megawatt argon laser,
because the detection of differences in retention has
been associated with various levels of BCRP expression.28 Topotecan accumulation after incubation for
15 minutes was expressed in fluorescence units. In
all fluorescence assays, cells without exposure to
topotecan were used as controls.
Bisulfite Modification of DNA From PC-6 and
PC-6/SN2-5H Cells
Genomic DNA was obtained from PC-6 and PC-6/
SN2-5H cells by using the QuickGene DNA Tissue Kit
S (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) with QuickGene-800 (Fujifilm) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA
was processed with the CpGenome DNA Modification Kit (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The promoter region
ranging from nucleotide (nt) 21381 to nt 1261 with
respect to the transcription initiation site of BCRP
(GenBank Accession no. AF151530)34 was divided
into 5 segments (A through E). Primer pairs for both
PCR and direct DNA sequencing were designed in
each region (Table 1). PCR was performed in a 25-lL
reaction mixture that contained 50 ng of bisulfitemodified DNA or unmodified DNA; 20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.4; 50 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl2; 240 lM dNTP;
0.4 lM each of the sense and antisense primers; and
1.5 U platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen).
Amplification was performed for bisulfite-modified
DNA with initial denaturation at 94 8C for 2 minutes;
35 cycles of denaturation at 94 8C for 30 seconds,
annealing for 60 seconds at each temperature for the
selected primer pair, and extension at 72 8C for 30
seconds; and final extension at 72 8C for 5 minutes;

and amplification was performed for unmodified
DNA with initial denaturation at 948C for 2 minutes;
35 cycles of denaturation at 94 8C for 30 seconds,
annealing for 30 seconds at each temperature for the
selected primer pair, and extension for at 72 8C for
30 seconds; and final extension at 72 8C for 5 minutes. A portion of PCR products was electrophoresed
on a 2% agarose-ME gel, and the remaining products
were used as a template for subsequent direct DNA
sequencing.

Direct DNA Sequencing Analysis
PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) to remove
primers and excess nucleotides and were sequenced
by using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
FS Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems). The
cycle sequencing was hot-started at 96 8C for 30 seconds; followed by 25 cycles at 10 seconds at 96 8C,
5 seconds at 50 8C, and 4 minutes at 72 8C; and
4 minutes at 60 8C. After sequencing reaction solutions were purified by using Sephadex G-50 superfine
columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), samples
were dried and sequenced with the ABI PRIAM 310
or 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

MSP for BCRP
To perform qualitative analysis of methylation of the
BCRP promoter by PCR, we designed primer pairs
for MSP35 on the basis of methylated and unmethylated DNA sequences in the promoter region of
BCRP as follows: methylation-specific sense primer
(M-BCRPf-s1): 50 -gcgtttcggttagtgacggc-30 (nt 2337 to
2318) and antisense primer (M-BCRPr-s1): 50 cccgcctccgaaatcgaacg-30 (nt 2213 to 2232); and
unmethylation-specific sense primer (U-BCRPf-s2):
50 -tagttttgttggtggtttagtgt-30 (nt 2147 to 2125) and
antisense primer (U-BCRPr-s2): 50 -aaccccaactaccaaaccaca-30 (nt 260 to 280). PCR was performed in
a 25-lL reaction mixture that contained 50 ng of
bisulfite-modified DNA from PC-6, PC-6/SN2-5H,
NCI-H69, NCI-H358, NCI-H441, or NCI-H460 cells;
20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4; 50 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl2;
240 lM dNTP; 0.4 lM M-BCRPf-s1/r-s1 or U-BCRPfs2/r-s2; and 1.5 U platinum Taq DNA polymerase
under the following conditions: for M-BCRPf-s1/r-s1,
initial denaturation at 95 8C for 2 minutes; 35 cycles
of denaturation at 94 8C for 30 seconds, annealing at
58 8C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72 8C for 30
seconds; and final extension at 728C for 5 minutes;

and extension at 72 8C for 30 seconds; and final
extension at 72 8C for 5 minutes. PCR products were
electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel (Nacalai Tesque). To evaluate the MSP
method for BCRP properly, we examined the correlation of promoter methylation analyzed by MSP with
BCRP mRNA expression in small cell lung cancer
cells (PC-6 and PC-6/SN2-5H cells) as well as other
nonsmall cell lung cancer cells (NCI-H69, NCI-H358,
NCI-H441, and NCI-H460 cells).

Statistical Analysis
A simple linear regression analysis was performed
with the relative BCRP mRNA expression as a
dependent variable and with the concentration of 5aza-dC as an independent variable by using Prism
4 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, Calif). A
P value < .05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
BCRP mRNA Expression in PC-6 Cells Treated
With 5-Aza-Dc
After non-BCRP-expressing PC-6 cells were treated
with 0.1 lM, 0.5 lM, 1 lM, or 2 lM of 5-aza-dC for
72 hours, the relative BCRP mRNA expression (the
BCRP/ACTB ratio) was increased to 0.0573, 0.0695,
0.0845, and 0.0980, respectively, in duplicate experiments (Fig. 1). These results indicate that 5-aza-dC

treatment induced BCRP re-expression in a dosedependent manner (r2 5 0.9550; P 5 .0228) and that
an alteration in the methylation status of the BCRP
promoter is correlated with the activation of BCRP
expression in small cell lung cancer cells.

BCRP Protein Expression and Efflux-pump
Activity in PC-6 Cell Panels
Treatment with 1 lM 5-aza-dC for 72 hours induced
PC-6 cells to express BCRP protein (Fig. 2). The
expression of BCRP protein in PC-6 cells that were
treated with 1 lM 5-aza-dC (Fig. 2, lane 2) relative to
the expression of BCRP protein in PC-6/SN2-5H cells
(Fig. 2, lane 1) was 0.19. However, in the parental
PC-6 cells (Fig. 2, lane 3), BCRP expression was not
observed. Moreover, the levels of BCRP protein
expression nearly coincided with the levels of BCRP
mRNA expression in PC-6 cells that were treated
with 5-aza-dC (Figs. 1, 2).
Subsequently, the intracellular topotecan accumulation (Fig. 3, green line) in PC-6/SN2-5H cells was
decreased remarkably compared with the accumulation in PC-6 cells (Fig. 3). Novobiocin, a competitive
inhibitor of BCRP, restored the intracellular topotecan
accumulation (Fig. 3, red line) in PC-6/SN2-5H cells
but had no effect on PC-6 cells (Fig. 3). In PC-6 cells
that were treated with 5-aza-dC, the intracellular topotecan accumulation was decreased to the levels
between those in PC-6/SN2-5H cells and in PC-6 cells
(green line), and novobiocin also restored the intracellular topotecan accumulation (Fig. 3, red line). These
results indicate that the functional efflux-pump activity
of BCRP almost corresponded to the level of BCRP
protein expression in PC-6 cell panels and in PC-6
cells that were treated with 1 lM 5-aza-dC.

at all 89 CpG sites (segments A through E) in the
promoter region of BCRP were methylated completely in PC-6 cells (Fig. 5). Conversely, in SN-38-resistant PC-6/SN2-5H cells, 79 CpG sites in the limited
region (segments C through E; nt 2720 to 1261)
were unmethylated at both alleles, but 10 CpG sites
in segments A and B (nt 21381 to 2721) were methylated (Fig. 5). These results suggest that unmethylation in the BCRP promoter is necessary for BCRP
expression in SN-38-resistant small cell lung cancer
cells.

Establishment of MSP for BCRP in Small Cell Lung
Cancer Cells
We have established an MSP method that readily can
identify methylated or unmethylated alleles in the
examined cells. A PCR product size of 125 base pairs
(bp) was detected in SN-38-sensitive PC-6 cells by
using only a methylation-specific PCR primer pair. In
SN-38-resistant PC-6/SN2-5H cells, a PCR product
size of 88 bp was yielded by using only an unmethylation-specific PCR primer pair (Fig. 6). These MSP
results were coincident with the results from the

Inverse Correlation Between Methylation of the BCRP
Promoter and BCRP Expression in Nonsmall Cell Lung
Cancer Cells
The relative expression of BCRP mRNA (BCRP/ACTB
ratio) was 1.00, 0.60, 0.42, and 0.22 in PC-6/SN2-5H,
NCI-H460, NCI-H441, and NCI-H358 cells, respectively (Fig. 6). In PC-6/SN2-5H cells in which BCRP
was highly expressed, both alleles were unmethylated. In moderately BCRP-expressing cells (NCIH460, NCI-H441, and NCI-H358 cells), 1 allele was
methylated, but another allele was unmethylated. In
non-BCRP-expressing PC-6 and NCI-H69 cells, both
alleles were methylated (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the unmethylation of 1 allele in the promoter region of BCRP induces BCRP mRNA expression
and that the MSP method we developed is useful for
detecting methylation status of the BCRP promoter.
Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between
methylation of the BCRP promoter and BCRP mRNA
expression in both small cell and nonsmall cell lung
cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we have demonstrated that
demethylation of the BCRP promoter induced BCRP
re-expression at the mRNA and protein levels in the
SN-38-resistant lung cancer cell line PC-6/SN2-5H.

This evidence was confirmed by bisulfite sequencing
analysis and the treatment of non-BCRP-expressing
PC-6 cells with 5-aza-dC, which acts as a DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor only after its incorporation into DNA and leads to irreversible binding of
methyltransferases to analog bases and to their
depletion.25,36 Moreover, BCRP was re-expressed by
5-aza-dC in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that promoter methylation is responsible for transcriptional silencing of BCRP in PC-6 cells
and that demethylation of at least 1 allele is necessary for BCRP re-expression and for BCRP-mediated
resistance to SN-38 in PC-6/SN2-5H cells. Thus, it is
likely that demethylation of the BCRP promoter may
be one of mechanisms of BCRP expression in both
small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer cells and in
multiple myeloma37 and renal carcinoma.38
However, the degree of BCRP expression at the
mRNA and protein levels in PC-6 cells that were treated with 5-aza-dC was far below the degree of
expression in PC-6/SN2-5H cells, as illustrated in
Figures 1 and 2. Although the 5-aza-dC treatment
may not induce demethylation of the BCRP promoter
generally and completely in all PC-6 cells that have
the hypermethylation, our results revealed that
demethylation of the CpG promoter motif may be
necessary in part but is not a sufficient condition for
gene transcription.37
BCRP is transcribed by a TATA boxless promoter
with multiple Sp1 sites and a CCAAT box.34,39 We
examined Sp1 mRNA expression by using semiquan-

predict BCRP expression by MSP for BCRP using
bisulfite-modified DNA. In addition, occasionally, it
is difficult to extract RNA from transbronchial lung
biopsy and microdissected specimens (because of
the small amount of tissues) and also to maintain
RNA quality, which depends on the length of time
frozen tissues are analyzed after biopsy. Conversely,
DNA facilitates the handling of extraction and the
maintenance of quality compared with RNA. Furthermore, because BCRP expression confers resistance to
several anticancer drugs, including irinotecan, topotecan, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, and
daunorubicin,10,13–17 which are substrates of BCRP,
assessment of BCRP expression is important for the
choice of these drugs before chemotherapy. Therefore, the presence or absence of methylation of the
BCRP promoter by MSP using DNA samples, and not
RNA samples, before chemotherapy may be useful as
a new biomarker in predicting drug resistance and
response to anticancer drugs that are effluxed by
BCRP to achieve an optimal treatment for each individual cancer patient.

titative RT-PCR in PC-6 and PC-6/SN2-5H cells. The
results indicated that the expression of Sp1 was
increased more in PC-6/SN2-5H cells than in PC-6
cells (data not shown), supporting the belief that Sp1
also contributes to BCRP re-expression.34 Thus, both
promoter demethylation of BCRP and overexpression
of transcription factors, including Sp1, may play a
role in the induction of BCRP re-expression in SN38-resistant lung cancer cells, although the former
may have a minor and partial role, and the latter
may contribute mainly and predominantly to BCRP
expression. It remains to be elucidated whether promoter demethylation of BCRP and activation of transcription factors contribute to the up-regulation of
BCRP expression in other cancer cell lines and tissues.
Gene silencing through hypermethylation of promoters has been studied with the MSP method in
various cancers.40–44 In those studies, the high sensitivity and specificity of MSP successfully allowed
accurate detection of the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. We also have developed the MSP
method to detect promoter methylation of BCRP.
Moreover, because promoter methylation is correlated inversely with BCRP expression in both small
cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer cells, it is easy to
