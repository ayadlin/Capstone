Abstract

Author Manuscript

Aneuploidy, referring here to genome contents characterized by abnormal numbers of
chromosomes, has been associated with developmental defects, cancer, and adaptive evolution in
experimental organisms1–9. However, it remains unresolved how aneuploidy impacts gene
expression and whether aneuploidy could directly bring phenotypic variation and improved fitness
over that of euploid counterparts. In this work, we designed a novel scheme to generate, through
random meiotic segregation, 38 stable and fully isogenic aneuploid yeast strains with distinct
karyotypes and genome contents between 1N and 3N without involving any genetic selection.
Through phenotypic profiling under various growth conditions or in the presence of a panel of
chemotherapeutic or antifungal drugs, we found that aneuploid strains exhibited diverse growth
phenotypes, and some aneuploid strains grew better than euploid control strains under conditions
suboptimal for the latter. Using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we show that
the levels of protein expression largely scale with chromosome copy numbers, following the same
trend observed for the transcriptome. These results provide strong evidence that aneuploidy
directly impacts gene expression at both the transcriptome and proteome levels and can generate
significant phenotypic variation that could bring about fitness gains under diverse conditions. Our
findings suggest that the fitness ranking between euploid and aneuploid cells is context- and
karyotype-dependent, providing the basis for the notion that aneuploidy can directly underlie
phenotypic evolution and cellular adaptation.

Whole-chromosome or segmental aneuploidy has been observed in a wide range of
organisms and conditions, from pathogenic and experimental fungal species adapting to
growth inhibition, to human diseases such as cancer and Down Syndrome2–10, but how
aneuploidy affects gene expression and cellular physiology remains unclear1,11–13. The
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with its 16-chromosome complement has been a
useful experimental model for addressing this question at a fundamental level. Experimental
evolution in yeast suggested a correlation between the emergence of aneuploidy and
adaptive phenotypes in response to various perturbations3–7,10. Transcriptome profiling
demonstrated that aneuploidy causes changes in mRNA levels mostly scaling with
chromosome copy numbers and well beyond for some genes7,10,11. On the other hand, two
recent studies concluded that aneuploidy reduces cellular fitness irrespective of the specific
karyotype11,12 and suggested that dosage compensation for proteins encoded on aneuploid
chromosomes correlates with a common stress response, dubbed “proteotoxic stress”11. This
raises the following conundrum: If net protein expression levels are insensitive to
chromosome stoichiometry and aneuploidy inevitably impairs fitness, how might aneuploidy
provide phenotypic variation and possibly fitness advantages under selective conditions?13
We aimed to resolve this conundrum using a panel of aneuploid yeast strains with a wide
range of karyotypes grown under diverse conditions. In particular, our experiments were
designed to answer these questions: 1) Can aneuploidy directly confer phenotypic variation
and possibly improved fitness? And 2) is the proteome proportionally affected by
chromosome copy number variation due to aneuploidy?

To generate fully isogenic and stable aneuploid strains, containing a wide range of
chromosome stoichiometries and without the need of any genetic selection, we induced
meiosis in yeast strains with an odd ploidy (3N or 5N), which produces aneuploid progenies
at high frequencies14,15 (Fig. 1a). To minimize other genetic variation, we generated the
starting triploid and pentaploid progenitor strains by cycles of mating type switching and
mating, from a single haploid S288c strain (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Absence of segmental
chromosome abnormalities in the resulting polyploid progenitors was verified by arraybased comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), although the pentaploid strain had
quickly lost one copy of chromosomes III and V (Supplementary Fig. 1b). To isolate
aneuploid strains with stable karyotypes, we used a multi-step approach (detailed in
Supplementary Methods). Briefly, each spore was first spread on a YEPD plate to form
single colonies (Fig. 1a). From each resulting plate displaying uniform colony sizes eleven
colonies were randomly picked and analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)
to identify those original spores producing colonies with uniform ploidy (Supplementary
Fig. 2a,b). Karyotype stability was further verified after freezing and revival (Supplementary
Fig. 2c). The karyotypes of the final aneuploid strains were determined by a novel
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based assay that allows accurate karyotyping
in high-throughput formats (Supplementary Methods; Fig. 1b–f; Supplementary Fig. 2d). A
subset of the karyotypes was also confirmed by aCGH (Fig. 1b–f; Supplementary Fig. 3). To
minimize accumulation of single nucleotide mutations, all aneuploid strains were passaged
no more than three times between initial derivation and experimental usage. Indeed, whole
genome re-sequencing of the five aneuploid strains used for the transcriptome and proteome
analyses (see below) revealed absence of mutations in coding regions that were not already

present in the parental strains (Supplementary Information). The above procedure yielded 38
isogenic stable aneuploid strains (12.5% of spores analyzed) with ploidy between 1N and
3N, harboring 35 distinct karyotypes, mostly with multiple chromosomes in aneuploidy
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Except for chromosomes II and IX, all 16 yeast chromosomes were
equally represented as aneuploid chromosomes in this collection (Fig. 1g). The chromosome
number distributions were skewed toward the left (lower number) from those expected from
random meiosis I segregation (Fig. 1h), suggesting that strains with larger numbers of
aneuploid chromosomes are either less viable or karyotypically unstable.

Growth comparison of the aneuploid strains with isogenic 1N, 2N and 3N euploid strains in
rich media at 23 °C confirmed the previous observation that most aneuploid strains grew
poorly compared with euploid controls11, although a few aneuploid strains grew similarly to
the euploids (Fig. 2a–c). Next we compared the growth under conditions divergent from that
optimal for euploid yeast cells, including environmental perturbations, such as extreme
temperature or pH or nutrient shortage, and the presence of chemotherapeutic or antifungal
drugs. Strikingly, while under every condition, most aneuploid strains grew slower than or
as poorly as the euploids, under several conditions, especially those severely retarding
euploid growth, some aneuploid strains showed improved growth in respect to euploids (Fig.
2e–h; Supplementary Fig. 5). Karyotyping at the end of the growth assays confirmed
persistent karyotype stability in most cases (Supplementary Information). For example,
several aneuploid strains grew significantly better than euploid strains in rich media at 16 °C
(Fig. 2e, f), or in the presence of drugs such as rapamycin (an immunosuppressant and
proposed anticancer agent), bleomycin (a chemotherapeutic compound), thiolutin (an
antibiotic) or fluconazole (an antifungal drug) at concentrations inhibitory to euploid growth
(Fig. 2g, h; Supplementary Fig. 5; Supplementary Table 3). The observed phenotypic
diversity was unlikely to be due to differences in mating type, as euploid strains with
different mating types grew similarly under the tested conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6).

To understand how phenotypes relate to karyotypes, we clustered the aneuploid strains
based on karyotypic similarity (Fig. 2i) and clustered the conditions used in the phenotypic
profiling based on their effects on growth (Fig. 2j; Supplementary Methods). This analysis
revealed that several pairs of aneuploid strains with identical (e.g. A26 and A27; A31 and
A33) or similar karyotypes (e.g. A8 and A17; A1 and A16; A20 and A21) exhibited similar
growth patterns across the different conditions. Second, along each growth condition
(column in Fig. 2j), divergent karyotypes can be observed that exhibited improved growth
compared to the haploid control under certain conditions. To pinpoint a specific mechanism
linking a specific aneuploid karyotype to a specific fitness improvement, we noticed that
strain A16, resistant to 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO, a tumorigenic compound), had
only chromosome XIII in aneuploidy. Chromosome XIII harbors the gene ATR1, encoding a
transporter protein known to confer 4-NQO hyper-resistance when overexpressed16. We
confirmed that an extra copy of chromosome XIII in strain A16 led to a proportional
increase in mRNA expression of ATR1 both in presence and absence of 4-NQO
(Supplementary Fig. 7a). Deletion of the extra copy of ATR1 from the 4-NQO resistant
aneuploid strains restored expression of ATR1 to levels comparable to euploid
(Supplementary Fig. 7a) and abolished their resistance to 4-NQO (Fig. 2d; Supplementary

Fig. 7b–c), demonstrating that the increased ATR1 copy number was required for 4-NQO
resistance. Furthermore, introducing one extra copy of the ATR1 gene expressed under its
own promoter into haploid or diploid euploid strains was sufficient to confer resistance to 4NQO (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Fig. 7b–c).

Immunoblot analysis of disomic yeast strains suggested that most proteins encoded on
aneuploid chromosomes may be dosage compensated11, raising a question as to how
aneuploidy might confer large phenotypic variation, as observed above. To investigate this
further, we performed parallel RNA microarray and quantitative proteomics analysis on five
aneuploid strains of the same mating type and exhibiting different growth rates and
chromosome stoichiometries. Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology
(MudPIT) analysis17 on the soluble fraction of whole-cell extracts identified ~2,000
different gene products per strain, representing ~33% of the yeast proteome with highly
reproducible quantification of protein abundances across the biological replicates and broad
coverage of all cellular components (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 4).
This analysis revealed that strains with similar karyotypes tend to have similar global
proteomic changes (Supplementary Fig. 8a) and that changes in chromosome copy numbers
due to aneuploidy lead to proportional changes in the chromosomal average protein
expression following the same trend as the transcriptome (Fig. 3a–c; Supplementary Figs 9
and 10a), indicating a direct gene dosage effect on the proteome. Dosage compensation was
also minimal and in most cases insignificant for core complex proteins18 encoded on
aneuploid chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. 10b).

The mRNA and protein levels of individual genes were modestly though significantly
correlated even after correcting for chromosomal copy number effect (Fig. 3d;
Supplementary Fig. 11), consistent with a recent proteomic analysis of haploid versus
diploid yeast19. However, among the genes with expression changes two standard deviations
away from their chromosomal average (referred to as ‘outlier’ genes), only a fraction (~3–
14%) were common between the microarray and the proteomics datasets (Fig. 3d;
Supplementary Fig. 11). As a result, mRNA outliers and protein outliers were enriched for
distinct classes of biological processes, and no specific class of genes was consistently found
to be significantly enriched across all aneuploid strains (Fig. 3e–f; Supplementary Fig. 12a–
b), suggesting a lack of a common gene expression response to aneuploidy. Because genes
of the “response to stress” category was enriched in neither the transcriptome nor the
proteome in any of our aneuploid strains, in contrast to the conclusion of the previous
study11, we further performed a more stringent analysis by only considering outlier genes
expressed more than three standard deviations from the chromosomal average in our
microarray data. Enrichment for either “response to stress” (Gene Ontology) or
“Environmental Stress Response” genes20 was found in three of the five aneuploid strains,
but interestingly this enrichment correlated with neither growth rates nor the number of
aneuploid chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. 12c). Taken together, the above results
indicate that aneuploidy has global and complex effects at both the transcriptome and the
proteome levels, and that an increase in stress gene expression is not a obligate property of
aneuploid strains.

Taken together, our analysis of a large set of isogenic and stable aneuploid yeast strains with
broad chromosome stoichiometries demonstrated that aneuploidy directly confers
phenotypic variation and sometimes growth advantage under conditions sub-optimal for
euploid cells. These observations suggest that aneuploidy does not inevitably result in
growth impairment, but rather that the impact of aneuploidy on cellular fitness is both
karyotype- and condition-dependent. The difference between our findings and the previous
observation of a common stress signature and proliferative disadvantage across disomic
yeast strains11 may be that in our study the naturally stable, multiple-chromosome
aneuploidy resulted in less protein expression imbalances than single-chromosome
aneuploidy maintained through continuous drug and nutrient marker selection. Furthermore,
our proteomic analysis, performed in quadruplicates and quantifying thousands of proteins
encoded on aneuploid chromosomes, in contrast to just 16 proteins analyzed by immunoblotting in the previous work, revealed a whole-sale chromosome dosage effect on the
proteome, consistent with a recent report of gene copy number effects on protein levels21.
These findings suggest that aneuploidy is a large-effect mutation profoundly altering gene
expression at the functional level. Under conditions to which euploid cells are well adapted,
the large phenotypic effects caused by aneuploidy are likely to cause a reduction in fitness
that could lead to rapid clearance of most aneuploid cells from the population. However,
under a strong selective pressure due to adverse environmental changes or clinical drug
treatments, the rise of aneuploidy, readily achieved through erroneous mitosis, can be a
highly effective mechanism to generate phenotypic variation and rapid adaptation.
