BACKGROUND. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) causes bone loss and fractures. Guidelines recommend bone density testing before
and during ADT to characterize fracture risk. The authors of the current report assessed bone density testing among men who received
ADT for  1 year. METHODS. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results/Medicare data were used to identify 28,960 men aged > 65
years with local/regional prostate cancer diagnosed from 2001 to 2007 who were followed through 2009 and who received  1 year of
continuous ADT. Bone density testing was documented in the 18-month period beginning 6 months before ADT initiation. Logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with bone density testing. RESULTS. Among men who received  1 year of ADT, 10.2%
had a bone density assessment from 6 months before starting ADT through 1 year after. Bone density testing increased over time (14.5%
of men who initiated ADT in 2007-2008 vs 6% of men who initiated ADT in 2001-2002; odds ratio for 2007-2008 vs 2001-2002, 2.29;
95% confidence interval, 1.83-2.85). Less bone density testing was observed among men aged  85 years versus men ages 66 to 69 years
(odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.89), among black men versus white men (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.610.86), and among men in areas with lower educational attainment (P < .001). Men who visited a medical oncologist and/or a primary care
provider in addition to a urologist had higher odds of testing than men who only consulted a urologist (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS. Few
men who received ADT for prostate cancer underwent bone density testing, particularly older men, black men, and those living in areas
with low educational attainment. Visiting a medical oncologist was associated with increased odds of testing. Interventions are needed to
increase bone density testing among men who receive long-term ADT. Data on bone density testing for nonmilitary populations of
prostate cancer survivors in the United States who have received long-term androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) have not been published. The current analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results/Medicare data suggests that few prostate cancer survivors
who receive long-term ADT undergo bone density testing; and several key populations, including African Americans and older men,

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous cancer in men in the United States.1 Although it is
also the second leading cause of cancer death in men, most patients with prostate cancer become long-term survivors of
the disease. Because of this, awareness of late complications of therapy is critical in treating men with prostate cancer.
Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is the most frequently used systemic therapy for men with prostate cancer.
Up to 50% of men with prostate cancer receive ADT during the course of their disease, and an estimated 600,000 American men with prostate cancer are receiving treatment with ADT at any given time.2,3 ADT improves overall survival when
given as adjuvant therapy for men with high-risk tumors and improves quality of life among men with metastatic prostate
cancer.4-6 However, its use is also high in other settings, for which benefits of treatment are less clear, although some evidence suggests that the use of ADT in these settings is declining.7
Although it is not as obviously toxic as chemotherapy, ADT is not without drawbacks.8 ADT causes a decline in
bone mineral density and increases the risk of treatment-related fragility fractures.9-14 Since 2008, guidelines of the National

Comprehensive Cancer Network have recommended routine bone density testing before and during treatment with
ADT to characterize a man’s risk of fracture.15 In addition,
the American College of Physicians 2008 guidelines for
osteoporosis screening among men recommend bone density testing for all men who are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis, including men who receive treatment
with ADT.16
Relatively few data are available describing rates of
bone density testing among men who receive ADT. Several single-institution studies of Veteran’s Health Administration practices have reported low rates of bone density
testing among men receiving ADT.17-19 To our knowledge, the frequency of bone density testing among men
with prostate cancer who were treated in nonmilitary
institutions in the United States has not been reported.
In the current analysis, we assessed bone density testing in a large, population-based cohort of older men with
prostate cancer in the United States who received ADT as
continuous treatment for at least 1 year. We also identified
patient, physician, and disease factors associated with testing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data

We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)/Medicare data for this analysis. The SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute collects uniformly
reported data from population-based cancer registries that
cover approximately 28% of the United States population.20 The information collected includes patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment with
surgery or radiation for each incident cancer.
Since 1991, SEER data have been merged with
Medicare administrative data using a matching algorithm
that successfully links files for over 94% of SEER
patients aged  65 years.21 The Medicare claims data
used in this study included the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file (inpatient admissions), the 100%
Physician/Supplier file (physicians’ services for comorbidity assessment and ascertainment of bone density testing and ADT), and the Hospital Outpatient Standard
Analytic file (outpatient facility services to identify
comorbidity and bone density testing and ADT).
Study Cohort

We identified all men with local/regional prostate cancer
(based on the SEER summary stage variable, in which
metastatic disease is defined as disease with distant site
involvement) diagnosed from 2001 to 2007 who were
aged  66 years at diagnosis and were enrolled in Parts A
864

and B of fee-for-service Medicare as of 1 year before diagnosis through 6 months after diagnosis (N ¼ 136,066).22
Men with metastatic disease were not studied because
bone density testing is not reliable in bone with metastatic
lesions; moreover, guidelines recommend bisphosphonate
therapy for metastatic disease without the need for bone
density testing. We excluded 1817 men who were diagnosed at autopsy and 3261 men who had no claims from
45 days before diagnosis through 195 days after diagnosis
(suggesting incomplete data). We then restricted to
118,839 men with locoregional prostate cancer who were
followed through 2009. Among these men, we identified
29,860 who had received ADT continuously for at least 1
year. ADT was ascertained based on claims for gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (Health Care Common
Procedure Coding System [HCPCS] codes J9217, J9218,
J9219, and J1950) or bilateral orchiectomy (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes 54520, 54521, 54522,
54530, 54535, 54690, and 49510; International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition [ICD-9] procedure codes
62.3, 62.4, 62.41, and 62.42). Men were considered
hypogonadal for 6 months after the date of their last injection with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy because it is known that treatment effects persist for
prolonged periods; thus, a man who received 6 months of
adjuvant ADT (for example, with two 3-month depot
injections of ADT) would be considered on therapy for 9
months and would not be included in these analyses.
Bone Density Testing

We assessed receipt of bone density testing (covered by
Medicare every 2 years), including testing with dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometry, ultrasound, or computed tomography bone density testing in the 18-month period from 6
months before the first dose of ADT through a 1-year period after the initiation of ADT (CPT codes 76070,
76071, 76075, 76076, 76077, 76078, 76977, 77078,
77079, 77080, 77081, 77082, 77083, 78350, and 78351;
ICD-9 procedure code 88.98; HCPCS code G0130; and
ICD-9 diagnosis code V82.81). This time frame allowed
us to capture baseline bone density testing before the initiation of ADT or up to 1 year after starting therapy.
Patient Characteristics

We characterized patients’ age, race/ethnicity, marital status, urban residence, SEER region, comorbid illness at the
time of initiation of ADT (based on the Klabunde modification of the Charlson Index23,24), year of initiation of
ADT, tumor grade (by Gleason score), primary treatment
(surgery, radiation, or neither), median household income
and proportion of high school graduates in the census

with 14.5% of men who initiated ADT during 2007 and
2008 undergoing testing versus 6% of men who initiated
ADT during 2001 and 2002 (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.832.85) (Fig. 1). Men aged  85 years were less likely than
men ages 66 to 69 years to undergo bone density testing
(OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89). There was not a statistically significant difference in testing rates between men of
other ages compared with men ages 66 to 69 years (Table
1). Black men were less likely than white men to undergo
testing (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.86), and men who
were not black or Hispanic had higher rates of testing
than white men (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.13-1.71). Men living in areas with higher educational attainment were more
likely to undergo bone density testing than those living in
areas with the lowest education levels. Testing rates did
not vary significantly by area-level median household
income (Table 1). Unmarried men were less likely to have
bone density testing than married men (OR, 0.82; 95%
CI, 0.72-0.93). Bone density testing was more frequent
among men who had 2 (vs none) comorbid medical
conditions. Testing also varied substantially by region,
with the highest rates in Los Angeles and Hawaii and the
lowest rates in Iowa and Connecticut.
The types of physicians with whom patients had visits
also were associated with bone density screening. Men who
had a medical oncologist or PCP or both involved in their
care were more likely to undergo testing than those who
visited a urologist but no medical oncologist or PCP (Table
1), with the highest odds of bone density testing for men
who visited a urologist, a medical oncologist, and PCP.
Hospitalization during the year after initiation of ADT was
not associated with receipt of bone density testing.

DISCUSSION
We examined bone density testing for a large, populationbased cohort of older men in the United States who were
diagnosed with locoregional prostate cancer and received
ADT for at least 1 year, and we observed that only 10.2%
of these men received bone density testing between 6
months before and 12 months after the initiation of
ADT. Rates of bone density testing increased over time,
although only 14.5% of men who initiated ADT during
2007 and 2008 underwent testing, despite guideline recommendations for testing that were published in
2008.15,16 Black men and elderly men were significantly
less likely than other men to undergo bone density testing.
Treatment by a medical oncologist or PCP in addition to
other providers was associated with a greater likelihood of
bone density testing.
Our finding of low rates of bone density testing
among prostate cancer survivors who received ADT is
consistent with previously reported evidence. Several
small, single-institution studies in Veteran’s Health
Administration settings indicated that 8.7% to 14% of
men who received ADT for prostate cancer of various
stages underwent bone density testing.17-19 A recent study
of Canadian men who received at least 6 months of ADT
for prostate cancer reported that the rate of bone density
testing during the 2 years after ADT initiation ranged
from 0.5 per 100 person-years in 1995 to 18 per 100 person-years in 2008.25 The lower rates of testing in our
study are likely related to our assessing bone density testing through 12 months after ADT initiation rather than
24 months, although differences in the US versus Canadian health care systems also may have contributed. Despite the low rates of bone density testing in our study,
rates were higher than in the general male population in
Medicare, in which the rates were 0.6% in 1999 and
1.7% in 2005, substantially lower than the rates for
women during the same periods.26
Our observation that black men had lower rates of
bone density testing than white men may have been the
result of physicians’ awareness that black men generally
have higher baseline bone density than white men.27,28
However, despite starting with a higher baseline bone
density, black men and white men on ADT lose bone at
867

an equivalent rate.29 Consistent with this, guidelines suggest that all men who receive ADT undergo baseline and
subsequent bone density testing to assist in determining
whether pharmacologic therapy to increase bone density
is necessary.30
Men aged > 85 years also were less likely to undergo
bone density testing in the current analysis. This finding is
consistent with other evidence suggesting less bone density testing in other settings as patients grow older.31
However, the risk of fracture increases with increasing
age. One study indicated that 98.8% of men aged > 80
years met criteria for treating bone loss to prevent fracture
based on recommendations using the World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) algorithm
treatment threshold.32,33 It is possible that we observed
lower rates of bone density testing in this group because
physicians assumed they should be treated for osteoporosis based on age and receipt of ADT alone, obviating the
need for additional radiographic data. We lacked data on
oral medications to assess bisphosphonate therapy. An
alternate explanation is that physicians recommend less
bone density testing for older men because they perceive
lower benefits to screening. It is also possible that physicians recommended testing, but patients elected not to
undergo testing.
Unmarried men and men living in areas with lower
educational attainment were less likely than other men to
undergo bone density testing. It is generally recognized that
married men’s health behaviors are influenced by their
spouses, and unmarried men with prostate cancer have
poorer overall survival.34 Unmarried men may not receive
additional encouragement to access health care resources in
general. Less bone density testing in men living in areas
with lower educational attainment may reflect the challenges of communicating the benefits of testing to men
who have less education or lower health literacy. Additional
resources may be needed to improve communication with
such populations about the benefits of testing.
Treatment by a medical oncologist and/or a PCP
versus a urologist without either of these providers was associated with higher rates of bone density testing. Medical
oncologists and PCPs may be more attuned to issues like
osteoporosis prevention than urologists. Alternatively, this
finding may reflect differences in the patients who seek care
from multiple providers, who may differ from individuals
who receive care from a single provider. These men may
have more time available for additional physician visits and
testing and may acquire more knowledge about the risks of
treatments because of care from an interdisciplinary team.
In addition, guidelines recommending routine use of bone
868

density testing before and during treatment with ADT are
published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American College of Physicians and may be
used more commonly by medical oncologists and PCPs
than by urologists. The American Society of Oncology has
not developed guidelines addressing bone density testing
for men with prostate cancer.
Men with more comorbidities were more likely to
undergo bone density testing than those who had no
comorbidities. Similar to men who have multiple practitioners involved in their cancer care, men who have more
comorbidities may have more opportunities for identifying a need for testing.
It is noteworthy that some of the factors we investigated were not associated with receipt of bone density testing in our study, including tumor grade, primary
treatment, area-level income, and urban/rural status,
although we observed large regional variations. Unlike an
analysis of bone density testing among men who received
treatment in a Veteran’s Health Administration hospital,
Hispanic ethnicity was not associated with bone density
testing in our study.17
Evidence about the adverse effects of ADT on skeletal health has been available for almost a decade; and,
since 2008, bone density testing has been recommended
by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.15,30 A
recent modeling study suggested that bone density testing
to guide treatment with bisphosphonates in men who are
receiving ADT for localized prostate cancer is a cost-effective approach to this aspect of survivorship care.35 Thus,
as efforts to improve the delivery of cost-effective preventive care increase, measuring and incentivizing the use of
bone density testing for this population may be an effective strategy.
Our study has some limitations. First, our study period started before evidence about ADT-associated bone
loss was widely available and ended in 2009. Thus, low
rates of bone density testing in the early years of this analysis may be explained by limited knowledge about the
effects of ADT on bone. However, the rates of testing
remained low throughout the study period, even after
guidelines were published. It is possible that practitioners
were unaware of the guidelines or disagreed with them
because they were based on trials that examined bone
mineral density, which is a surrogate endpoint, rather
than fracture prevention. Second, we lacked information
about physicians’ recommendations for testing and could
only determine whether testing was received. Third, we
studied only men aged > 65 years who were living in
SEER areas and were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare;

testing patterns may differ among younger men or men in
other parts of the United States. In addition, we did not
assess bisphosphonate use, because information on oral
medication was not available before 2006 and was available only for men enrolled in Medicare Part D after 2006.
We also did not examine visits with radiation oncologists,
who may prescribe adjuvant ADT. Finally, the current
study was exploratory, and our statistical analysis did not
adjust P values for multiple comparisons.
In conclusion, the current results indicate that few
prostate cancer survivors who receive long-term ADT
undergo bone density testing, and several key populations, including African Americans and older men, have
considerably lower rates of bone density screening.
Additional efforts are needed to increase screening for
treatment-associated osteoporosis to prevent fractures in
these men.
