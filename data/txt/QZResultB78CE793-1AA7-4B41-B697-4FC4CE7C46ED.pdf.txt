ABSTRACT:
Pancreatic carcinoma is one of the cancers with the worse prognosis, thus any
therapeutic improvement is imperative. Cytotoxic LH-RH analog, AN-152 (proprietary
designation, AEZS-108), consisting of doxorubicin (DOX) conjugated to D-Lys6LH-RH,
is now in clinical trials for targeted therapy of several sex hormone-dependent tumors
that express LH-RH receptors. We investigated LH-RH receptors in human pancreatic
carcinoma and the effects of AN-152 (AEZS-108) on experimental pancreatic cancers.
We determined LH-RH receptor presence in human pancreatic cancer samples by
immunohistochemistry and, in three human pancreatic cancer lines (SW-1990, Panc-1
and CFPAC-1), by binding assays and Western blotting. The effects of the cytotoxic
LH-RH analog were investigated on growth of these same cancer lines xenografted
into nude mice. We also analyzed differences between the antitumor effects of the
cytotoxic analog and its cytotoxic radical alone, doxorubicin (DOX), on the expression
of cancer-related genes by PCR arrays. LH-RH receptors were expressed in two
randomly selected surgically removed human pancreatic cancer samples and in all
three cancer lines. Cytotoxic LH-RH analogs powerfully inhibited growth of all three
tumor lines in nude mice; AN-152 was significantly stronger than DOX on Panc-1 and
CFPAC-1 cancers. PCR array showed that cytotoxic LH-RH analog AN-152 affected
the expression of genes associated with cellular migration, invasion, metastasis and
angiogenesis more favorably than DOX, however the changes in gene expression
varied considerably among the three cancer lines. Cytotoxic LH-RH analog, AEZS108, may be a useful agent for the treatment of LH-RH receptor positive advanced
pancreatic carcinoma.

is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in both males
and females. [1] Its incidence has increased in the white

population by about 1% per year between 1999 through
2008. [2] Ductal carcinomas of the pancreas are very
aggressive tumors, and because of the concealed location
of the gland, they are mostly detected in late stages of
development when surgical removal is not useful. Thus,
the 5-year survival rate is below 5% and the median
survival time after diagnosis is less than 6 months. [3]
There is not an accepted uniform standard therapy around
the world for pancreatic carcinoma; treatment methods
vary by location and economic circumstances. [4] Current
treatment modalities such as gemcitabine alone or in
combination with 5-fluorouracil, radiation or erlotinib,
(an EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor), provide
minimal palliation for patients with advanced pancreatic
cancers; latest reviews from around the world express
overall disappointment with these results. [5-8] Recent
trials showed that a combination regimen, FOLFIRINOX
(5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxiplatin),
showed superiority to gemcitabine monotherapy, but
the combination is highly toxic and is recommended
only for fit patients. [9-11] On the other hand, most
publications express the opinion, so far justified, that the
rapidly growing body of information on the molecular
pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer will provide new
therapeutic approaches for these patients. Because of
the poor survival rates and the low response rates to
chemotherapy, the NCI suggests that “Clinical trials are
appropriate alternatives for treatment of patients with
any stage of disease and should be considered prior to
selecting palliative approaches”. [12]
One possible way to increase the efficacy of therapy
is to target drugs to specific molecular components in
cancer cells, such as growth factors and their receptors,

or proliferation-promoting kinases etc. [13-16] Specific
receptors for hypothalamic peptide hormones, including
LH-RH, somatostatin and bombesin have been detected
in various cancers, and these receptors may serve as
targets for the peptide ligand linked to a cytotoxic agent.
[13, 15, 17-21] Thus we have developed new classes of
targeted antitumor agents by linking doxorubicin (DOX),
or its derivative, 2-pyrrolino-DOX (AN-201), to LHRH, somatostatin and bombesin. Since these cytotoxic
compounds are targeted to receptors for these specific
hormones on tumor cells, the concentration of the toxic
agent in tumor tissue is increased and normal cells are
spared from exposure to toxicity. We demonstrated that in
animal models, cytotoxic analogs of LH-RH, somatostatin
and bombesin may each have very powerful inhibitory
effects on cancers that express the corresponding receptors
for the carrier peptide; these hybrid compounds are more
effective and less toxic than the cytotoxic radicals alone.
[13, 15, 21]
Based on information that receptors for somatostatin
and bombesin are expressed in pancreatic cancers we
tested the effects of cytotoxic analogs of somatostatin
(AN-238) and bombesin (AN-215) on human pancreatic
cancer lines xenografted into nude mice. AN-238 and
AN-215 significantly inhibited growth of SW-1990,
Panc-1, CFPAC-1, Capan-1 and Capan-2 tumors each
of which expresses various subtypes of somatostatin
receptors and bombesin receptors. [22, 23] LH-RH and
its receptor are not confined to the hypothalamic-pituitary
axis. [24] In the periphery, the LH-RH system coordinates
gonadal functions and serves as a growth factor of benign
conditions [25-28] and various malignancies. [29, 30]

in pancreatic cancers in 1989, several other groups
have confirmed that receptors for LH-RH are present in
pancreatic tumors [15, 21] Based on these findings, in
the present study, we investigated the effects of cytotoxic
LH-RH analog AN-152 (AEZS-108), consisting of
[D-Lys6]LH-RH linked to DOX-14-O-hemiglutarate on
various human pancreatic cancers in nude mice. [13] This
analog has had strong inhibitory effects on experimental
prostate, breast, ovarian, endometrial, renal and colorectal
carcinomas, as well as non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas and
melanomas. [13, 15, 21] AN-152 (AEZS-108), is now in
phase I/II and III clinical trials for the treatment of human
ovarian, endometrial, prostate and bladder cancers. [31]

LH-RH receptor protein (38 kD), detected with
Western blotting, was present in all three tumor lines;
the amount of this protein was not significantly different
between treated and control samples (Fig. 2)
Earlier binding studies demonstrated moderateaffinity binding sites for LH-RH also in nitrosamineinduced pancreatic cancers in hamsters (13).

Effect of treatment on tumor growth in nude mice
In Experiment 1, AN-152 powerfully inhibited
growth of Panc-1 cancers in nude mice, while DOX had
only a moderate but not significant inhibitory effect (Fig.
3, Table 1). Neither treatment had an effect on body and
organ weights of the mice.
In Experiment 2, cysts containing clear yellowish
or brownish liquid developed in many tumors SW-1990
starting on treatment day 30. These cysts grew very
rapidly, making tumor volume results non-germane. Thus
the volumes of macroscopically cystic and non-cystic
tumors were calculated separately. Similarly, at autopsy,
the cystic tumors were weighed, the tumors cut, and the
fluid released, and the solid parts weighed again. Tumor
volume changes are shown in Figure 3, the numerical data
are shown in Table 1. Tumor volume was significantly
lower in both groups treated with cytotoxic compounds.
Weights of cystic tumor were significantly reduced by
treatment with AN-152 and solid tumor weights were
reduced by AN-152 and DOX. Weight ratio of cystic
versus solid tumors was highest in the groups receiving
AN-152 showing that the fluid amount was significantly
larger in this group than in the other groups. Body
weights and weights of livers, kidneys and ovaries were
significantly lower in the groups receiving cytotoxic

RESULTS
LH-RH receptor expression in clinical pancreatic
cancer specimens and in human cancer lines
Immunohistochemical investigation verified the
expression of LH-RH receptors in two randomly selected
archived samples of surgically removed human pancreatic
cancers (Fig. 1). Positive staining was observed in the
malignant epithelial cells, but not in stromal elements or
peritumoral tissues.
In untreated samples of the three human pancreatic
cancer lines, high affinity and low capacity LH-RH
receptors were detected. The dissociation constants and
maximal binding capacities of the receptors were as
follows: SW-1990: Kd= 4.51±0.51 nM, Bmax=624.3±24.3
fmol/mg protein; Panc-1: Kd=6.27±0.08 nM,
Bmax=495.3±17.4 fmol/mg membrane protein; CFPAC-1:
Kd=3.89±0.12 nM, Bmax=306.0±27.5 fmol/mg protein.

compounds but not in those treated with D-Trp6LH-RH.
In Experiment 3, volume changes of CFPAC-1
tumors are shown in Figure 3 and numerical data are
shown in Table 1. Tumor volume was significantly lower
in the groups treated with AN-152. Treatment with DOX
resulted in a moderate but not significant decrease in
tumor volume. Tumor weights were also reduced after
treatment with AN-152, but the differences from control
were statistically not significant. Body weights were the
lowest in the group receiving DOX, but the differences
from control were statistically not significant. Organ
weights were not changed by the treatments, except for
ovarian weights, which were reduced by DOX.

showed only decreases in CFPAC-1 cancers (all Fig. 4B).
To analyze the effects of AN-152 and DOX on
expression of apoptosis-related genes, the Human
Apoptosis RT Profiler PCR Array was used. Among the
pro-apoptotic genes investigated, several were increased
in Panc-1 and decreased in CFPAC-1 cancers, but were
changed in both directions in SW-1990 (Fig. 5A). Thus,
the expression of anti-apoptotic genes was mostly
increased in Panc-1 and SW-1990 and decreased in
CFPAC-1 tumors, similarly by both agents (Fig. 5B).

To discover differences in the effects of AN-152
and DOX on molecules important in cancer development
and progression, the Human Cancer Pathway Finder PCR
Array was used. The expression of genes in the treated
tumors compared to controls is shown in Fig. 4A,B.
Among the genes related to invasion and metastasis, both
decreases and increases in expression were observed in
all three tumor lines, with DOX causing the stronger
increases. Expression of angiogenesis-related genes varied
in different directions in the three tumors; mostly increases
were seen in Panc-1 and SW-1990 while mostly decreases,
in CFPAC-1. The decreases were caused mostly by AN152 and the increases by DOX. Expression of genes
associated with adhesion was decreased in Panc-1 and
CFPAC-1 cancers by both compounds, somewhat more
strongly by AN-152, and were changed in both directions
by both agents in SW-1990 tumors (all Fig. 4A). Both AN152 and DOX caused changes in expression of the genes
related to signal transduction molecules and transcription
factors; DOX caused considerable increases or decreases
in some. Increases and decreases in expression of
apoptosis-associated genes were variable in the three
tumors after both treatments. The genes associated with
cell cycle control and DNA damage repair were altered

DISCUSSION

we demonstrated that cytotoxic LH-RH analog, AN152 (AEZS-108), also has a strong inhibitory effect on
experimental pancreatic cancers.
PCR arrays have been successfully used in our
previous studies to detect molecular changes elucidating
the effects of our antineoplastic compounds. [37-39]
Using the PCR array method in the present study, we
also discovered some differences between the effects of
the cytotoxic hormone analog and the cytotoxic radical
moiety. The genes which were investigated encode
proteins that are involved in various biological pathways
important in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. The
changes were each relatively modest, probably because
the animals were sacrificed on the average of 3 weeks
after the last injection. Small changes add up however, as
many genes were affected. Differences between the effects
of AN-152 and the DOX moiety were demonstrated
mainly in genes associated with invasion and metastasis,
adhesion and angiogenesis. AN-152 affected MMPrelated genes more markedly than DOX; however, DOX
strongly increased TIMP3, which is an MMP inhibitor.
Metalloproteinases are responsible for extracellular matrix
and basement membrane degradation in tumors and thus
have a major role in invasion and metastasis. MMP1,
MMP2 and MMP9, as well as their inhibitors, TIMP1
and TIMP2, were detected in pancreatic cancers, and their
concentrations correlated with tumor grade, tumor size,
invasive characteristics, and metastasis. [40-42] Drugs
that inhibit the activity of MMPs in cancer progression
have been sought, developed and tested clinically, thus
the ability of AN-152 to decrease MMP levels may be an
important factor in its mechanism of tumor inhibition, and
its efficacy.
Both AN-152 and DOX decreased expression of
genes connected to adhesion in Panc-1 and CFPAC-1
tumors, with AN-152 having a slightly stronger effect. In
CFPAC-1 cancers, angiogenesis-related gene expression
was strongly decreased by AN-152 and strongly increased
by DOX. There was no major difference in the effects of
AN-152 and DOX on other gene expression categories,
including apoptosis-related genes. Consequently, it
is obvious that these effects depend not only on the
compounds used for therapy, but also on the type of
tumor. Thus, it is understandable that in these experiments
with pancreatic tumors the two compounds similarly
affected genes associated with apoptosis, while they acted
differently on these same genes in bladder cancers [43] or
glioblastomas [44] in other experiments.
Summarizing the results of our study, we can
state that receptors for LH-RH are expressed in human
pancreatic cancers, and that receptor-targeted therapy
with the cytotoxic LH-RH analog, AN-152 (AEZS108), has a stronger inhibitory effect on the growth of
human pancreatic cancer lines in nude mice than the
cytotoxic radical, DOX. In SW-1990 cancers, where
LH-RH receptor expression seemed to be the lowest, the

Recent advances in understanding the molecular
mechanisms involved in the genesis and progression
of pancreatic cancer have provided us with novel
therapeutic approaches. Among the new modalities,
which have become commercially available, some target
growth factors and their receptors, (e.g. EGF or PDGF)
and intracellular kinases (e.g. protein kinase C), and
some target pro-angiogenic molecules (e.g. VEGF or
interleukin-8). [14, 32-34]
Receptors for various peptide hormones are
present in pancreatic cancers and these receptors can be
utilized for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
[15, 21]. LH-RH receptors in experimental and human
pancreatic tumors were demonstrated long ago. [15, 21]
however, their function and importance is still unclear.
The combined detection of mRNA for both LH-RH and
LH-RH receptor in rat pancreatic cancer lines raised the
possibility of an autocrine/paracrine role of LH-RH in
these tumors. [35] The findings that both estrogen and
androgen receptors are likewise expressed in pancreatic
carcinoma indicate that sex steroids may also play a role
in the growth of these tumors. We have shown in several
experiments that treatment with an LH-RH agonist,
D-Trp6LH-RH, or antagonist, cetrorelix, inhibits growth
of nitrosamine-induced pancreatic cancers in hamsters.
[15, 21] This inhibition can be the result of the blockade
of the pituitary-gonadal axis or of a direct effect through
LH-RH receptors in tumors. Unfortunately, clinical trials
with LH-RH agonists have had disappointing results in
pancreatic cancer patients. [15, 21] The actual mechanism
of action of cytotoxic LH-RH analogs differs from those
of hormone agonists or antagonists however, as in this
situation the hormone performs only a delivery role,
carrying the cytotoxic moiety to tumor cells that express
specific receptors for that hormone. Thus, AN-152 (AEZS108) acts primarily as a cytotoxic molecule targeted to
tumor cells rather than as a hormonal agent. The inhibitory
effect of AN-152 (AEZS-108) on two pancreatic cancer
lines was recently demonstrated by others. [36]
In the present study we demonstrated the presence
of LH-RH receptors in clinical pancreatic cancer
samples as well as in three human pancreatic cancer cell
lines. Cytotoxic LH-RH analog, AN-152 (AEZS-108)
powerfully inhibited growth of all three of these lines
xenografted into nude mice. DOX alone also had an
inhibitory effect on growth of SW-1990 tumors, but AN152 acted significantly more strongly than DOX on Panc-1
and CFPAC-1 tumors.
In previous studies, various other of our cytotoxic
conjugates, such as cytotoxic analog of LH-RH (AN207), somatostatin (AN-238) and bombesin (AN-215),
powerfully inhibited growth in nude mice of human
pancreatic cancer lines that expressed the specific
receptors for those carrier peptides (17, 18). Herein,

difference between the effects of the two compounds was
the least. Because of the poor response to conventional
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, patients
with any stage of pancreatic cancer can appropriately be
considered as candidates for clinical trials with this agent.
Based on our results, AEZS-108 (AN-152) deserves to
be tried for treatment of patients with LH-RH receptor
positive pancreatic cancers.

Detection of LH-RH receptors in human
pancreatic cancer specimens
Two archived samples of surgical specimens
of human pancreatic cancers were used for the
immunohistochemical studies. These were formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded.  Three micrometer thick sections
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to confirm the
presence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Adjacent serial
sections were then utilized for the immunoperoxidase
procedure following standard protocol. Briefly, the
slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated and washed in
phosphate-buffered saline solution. Antigen retrieval was
performed in a pressure cooker with Dako Target Retrieval

the reaction was visualized using diaminobenzidine. The
slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Human
pituitary (anterior lobe), obtained from autopsy, was used
as positive control.

LH-RH agonist [D-Lys6]LH-RH (pyroGlu-His-TrpSer-Tyr-D-Lys-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2) carrier was synthesized
in our laboratory by solid-phase methods. DOX.HCl
salt was purchased from Chemex Export-Import GmbH
(Vienna, Austria). Cytotoxic LH-RH conjugate AN-152
was synthesized by AEterna/Zentaris (Frankfurt am Main,
Germany). Chemicals, unless stated otherwise, were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). For treatment,
the cytotoxic compounds were dissolved in 0.01 M
aqueous acetic acid and diluted with 5.5% (w/v) aqueous
D-mannitol, and 0.2 ml/20 g body weight of this solution
was injected into the jugular veins of the test mice.

Animals and Tumors

Molecular analysis

Female athymic nude mice (Ncr nu/nu) were
obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick
Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick,
MD), Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.
(Durham, NC) and Harlan Laboratories (Tampa, FL)
and maintained under pathogen-limited conditions. SW1990, Panc-1 and CAPAN-1cells were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas,
VA) and maintained in culture according to ATCC’s
recommendation. To produce tumor donor animals, 106
cells of each line were injected subcutaneously into 3 nude
mice and grown until well-developed tumors were grown.
The resulting tumors were removed, minced and 2 mm3
pieces of tumor tissue were transplanted subcutaneously
into each flank area of the experimental nude mice. When
the tumors became measurable, the mice were divided into
groups with nearly equal average tumor sizes. Control and
treatment groups were then selected at random.

After isolating total RNA and protein from tumor
samples from experiments 2, 3 and 4 by using the
NucleoSpin kit (Macherey-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA, USA),
the Human Cancer Pathway Finder Superarray and the
Human Apoptosis RT Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen Inc.
Valencia, CA, USA) were used to analyze 3 representative
samples from each group for mRNA levels of genes related
to cell adhesion, apoptosis, cell cycle, angiogenesis, signal
transduction, invasion and metastasis. Quality control of
RNA samples, synthesis of cDNA and RT-PCR arrays
were performed as described. [46] Gene expression
data were examined using Excel based PCR Array Data
Analysis Software provided by Qiagen; fold-changes in
gene expression were calculated using the ΔΔCt method
and five housekeeping genes (B2M, HPRT1, RPL13A,
GAPDH, and ACTB) were used for normalization of the
results.
The proteins isolated from three tumor samples
in Experiments 2, 3 and 4 were processed for Western
blotting to detect expression of LH-RH receptors as
described. [47] Briefly, isolated proteins were sonicated
and the lysates were adjusted to equal concentrations.
Primary antibodies for LH-RH receptor were purchased
from Abcam (ab-58561; Cambridge, MA, USA). The
immunoreactive bands were visualized with the Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System, and 3.0 software was used (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).

Experimental protocol
In Experiment 1, nude mice with Panc-1 tumors
were treated iv. on days 1, 8. 15, 22, 33 and 61 as follows:
Group 1: Control (vehicle only); Group 2: AN-152, 6.9
µmol/kg; Group 3, DOX, 2.5 µmol/kg. There were 8
animals in each group. The experiment was terminated on
day 82.
In Experiment 2, the treatment of mice with SW1990 cancers started 33 days after implantation as
follows: Group 1: Control; Group 2: AN-152; Group 3:
DOX, Group 4: D-Trp6[LH-RH]. All compounds were
administered iv.(at 6.9 µmol/kg) once weekly for 7 weeks.
There were 10 animals per group. The experiment was
terminated 65 days after the first treatment.
In experiment 3, the treatment started 87 days after
implantation of CFPAC-1 cancers as follows: Group
1: Control; Group 2: AN-152; Group 3: DOX. The
compounds were given iv. on days 1, 5, 8, 12, 15 and 30.
There were 8 animals per group, and the experiment lasted
to the 61st day of the treatment period.

Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA (Sigmaplot-11 software; Jandel
Scientific, San Raphael, CA) was used for statistical
evaluation of the data, and the groups were compared
using Dunnett’s method.

work was supported in part by a grant from the Urology
Care Foundation Research Scholars Program and the
AUA Southeastern Section (to FGR), and the Weeks
Endowment for Research (to NLB).

Receptor binding assay
LH-RH receptors were analyzed by the binding
of 125I-labeled [D-Trp6]LH-RH to tumor membrane
homogenates of control animals as described. [45] Four
analyses were done in all samples in duplicate or triplicate
tubes and binding characteristics were acquired from
12-point displacement experiments. The LIGAND PC
computerized curve-fitting program was used to determine
the type of binding, the maximal binding capacity of the
receptors and the dissociation constant (31).
