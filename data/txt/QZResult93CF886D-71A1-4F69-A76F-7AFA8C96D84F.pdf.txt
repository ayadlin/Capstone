ABSTRACT
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is widely overexpressed in
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and it results is associated with a poor
prognosis. Identifying the subgroup of ESCC patients who are sensitive to EGFRtargeted therapy is a key point to facilitate its medical use.
We retrospectively analyzed 32 ESCC patients treated with the combination of
nimotuzumab (h-R3) and radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Expression
of EGFR and phosphorylated proteins associated with EGFR signaling pathway, i.e.
p-Akt and p-Erk, were assessed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for all patients.
Correlations between these proteins’ expression levels and overall survival (OS) were
assessed.
High expression of EGFR, p-Akt and p-Erk was detected in 53.1% (17/32), 54.8%
(17/31) and 59.4% (19/32) of tumors respectively. No significant differences in
OS were found between high EGFR, p-Akt and p-Erk expression groups and their
respective counterparts. Of note, significantly better overall survival was observed
in patients with coexistence of high EGFR expression and low p-Akt expression (p =
0.030).
Our data allowed us to put forward a hypothesis that high EGFR and low p-Akt
expression may predict a clinical benefit of EGFR antagonists such as nimotuzumab
combined with RT or CRT. This can be discussed in the terms of oncogene addiction
and synthetic lethality concepts. This hypothesis can be further tested in larger groups
of patients.

INTRODUCTION

palliative benefits were reported in these difficult-totreat patients with short life expectancy [13]. Therefore,
identifying the subgroup of ESCC patients who are
sensitive to EGFR-targeted therapy represents the key
point to increase its efficacy.
Nimotuzumab (h-R3) is an anti-EGFR antagonist
humanized monoclonal antibody showing promising
performance in head and neck cancer and esophageal
cancer with excellent safety profile and limited side effect
[14, 15]. In a previously published retrospective study,
we found that combining h-R3 with radiotherapy (RT) or
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) resulted in moderate benefit on
OS in patients with advanced ESCC [16]. Subsequently,
the question whether the expression level of EGFR,
phosphorylated (p-) Akt or phosphorylated (p-) Erk could
be used as factors to predict the overall survival (OS) in
these patients was investigated. We hypothesized that
patients with high EGFR expression would have a better
overall survival with the EGFR inhibitor h-R3 antibody,
compared with the patients with low expression.

In 2012, an estimated 455,800 new esophageal
cancer cases and 400,200 deaths occurred worldwide. The
highest rates are found in Eastern Asia and in Eastern and
Southern Africa and the lowest rates are found in Western
Africa [1]. Although improved surgical techniques
and combined modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiotherapy) have been developed and introduced into
clinical practice over the last decade, the overall survival
(OS) for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
remains unsatisfying, with reported five-year OS rates
of only 20% to 47% [2-4]. In order to improve this
situation far from ideal, targeted therapy has been widely
investigated in ESCC.
It has been demonstrated that overexpression
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which
can be detected in 50%-70% of esophageal cancer
cases, is correlated with poor prognosis [5-8]. With a
ligand binding to its extracellular domain, EGFR can
be activated and subsequently promotes proliferation,
survival, angiogenesis, and resistance to radiotherapy and
chemotherapy mainly through two signaling pathways:
the RAS/RAF/MEK/Erk/MAPK and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
axes [7, 9-11].
It is certainly not unreasonable to assume that EGFR
blockage might be an effective therapy for ESCC, but no
improvement in clinical efficacy was found in unselected
esophageal cancer patients according to the results of
the randomized phase II/III SCOPE1 study in which
adding cetuximab (an anti-EGFR antagonist monoclonal
antibody) to standard definitive chemoradiotherapy was
evaluated [12]. Similarly, the clinical trial COG found
no improvement on overall survival for gefitinib as a
second-line treatment in esophageal cancer [13], however

RESULTS
Clinical characteristics and outcome
Pre-therapeutic tumor materials were available from
32 patients whose clinical characteristics were shown in
Table 1. Among these patients, 30 (93.8%) of them were
treatment-naïve while the other 2 (6.3%) had relapsed
disease after surgery or radiation. There were 25 patients
(78.1%) who received concurrent h-R3 and CRT and 7
patients (21.9%) received concurrent h-R3 and RT. Dose
of 100mg, 200mg and 400mg of h-R3 were given to 5, 22

p-Akt high, 6 patients were EGFR high/p-Akt low and 6
patients were EGFR low/p-Akt high. Furthermore, there
was not significant correlation between p-Akt expression
and age, gender, tumor length and tumor stage.
For p-Erk, 13 (40.6%) tumor samples exhibited
low expression and 19 (59.4%) samples showed high
expression. There were 8 patients EGFR low/p-Erk low,
12 patients EGFR high/p-Erk high, 5 patients EGFR high/
p-Erk low and 7 EGFR low/p-Erk high. Statistical analysis
did not show any significant correlation between p-Erk
and age, gender, tumor length, tumor stage and EGFR.

The percentages of stained cells (IHC scores) for
EGFR, p-Akt and p-Erk are shown in Figure 1. Median
values were 80%, 30% and 80% respectively. Studied
proteins showed different expression patterns in the
evaluated tumor samples. Among the 32 samples examined
for EGFR expression, 15 (46.9%) were classified as EGFR
low and 17 (53.1%) exhibited high EGFR expression. 4
out of 17 patients belonging to the EGFR-high subgroup
underwent radiation combined with h-R3 and the others
were treated with the combination of chemoradiotherapy
plus h-R3. No correlation was found between EGFR
expression and age, gender, tumor length, or tumor stage.
Assessment for p-Akt expression was performed
in 31 tumor samples, 14 (45.2%) of them were classified
as low expression while 17 (54.8%) exhibited high
expression. There was no correlation between the
expression of EGFR and p-Akt (p = 0.224), 8 patients
were EGFR low/p-Akt low, 11 patients were EGFR high/

Correlation between protein expression and OS
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate
the OS. As shown in Figure 2A, there was a trend (p =
0.289) that patients expressing high EGFR had better OS
compared with patients with low expression. In addition,
no significant correlation between the protein expressions
and OS for p-Akt (p = 0.897, Figure 2B) and p-Erk (p

inhibitors have been developed during the last ten years,
including monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab
and panitumumab, and small tyrosine kinase inhibitors
such as gefitinib and erlotinib. However, results less
favorable than expectations were observed in clinical trials
investigating the combination of cetuximab or gefitinib
and concurrent conventional chemotherapy in esophageal
cancer [12, 13]. Although no improvement in OS was
found for the entire population investigated, results of
these trials suggest that patients with certain clinical and/
or biological characteristics may do better with EGFR
inhibitors and these characteristics especially certain
molecular biomarkers may be useful for stratification and
outcome prediction.
Given that predictive markers for other epithelial
cancers such as mutations in KRAS, EGFR or BRAF are
rarely detected in esophageal cancers, EGFR expression
has been predominantly investigated for its potentiality
of predicting treatment outcome for esophageal cancers
[18-21]. However, Liang J et al demonstrated that EGFR
failed to predict the outcome in a phase II study combining
h-R3 and radiation therapy in ESCC [22]. Furthermore, no
correlation between EGFR expression and outcome was
observed in patients with gastroesophageal (GE) junction
and gastric adenocarcinoma treated with erlotinib or
cetuximab [23, 24].
As to p-Akt and p-Erk alone, a few clinical
researches had tested their contribution in regimens
containing EGFR inhibitors. In a Phase II trial of erlotinib
in gastroesophageal junction and gastric adenocarcinomas,
no correlation was found between p-Akt and clinical
outcome [24]. In experimental models, Fichter et al
reported in OE21 cells (ESCC cell line overexpressing
EGFR), a significant reduction of cell viability up to about
50% occurred upon treatment with erlotinib, gefitinib
or lapatinib. All three inhibitors reduced p-Akt level but
p-Erk expression remained the same as pretreatment
[25]. Mimura et al also demonstrated p-Akt expression
was enhanced to a large extent by EGF, whereas p-Erk

= 0.965, Figure 2C) was found. Results of multivariate
analysis (Cox regression) aiming to determine the
independent prognostic values of different variables,
including age, gender, with chemotherapy or not, tumor
stage, radiation dose, EGFR expression, p-Erk expression
and p-Akt expression, did not show statistically significant
findings.
In order to identify a patient subgroup that is most
likely to benefit from the treatment, combined effect of
biomarkers were evaluated. Given the possible trend that
patients with high EGFR expression might benefit more
from h-R3 treatment (Figure 2A), we further compared
the OS of patients with high EGFR expression and certain
p-Akt or p-Erk expression status with that of the rest of
the patients (e.g. patients with high-EGFR and high p-Akt
versus the entirety of other patients). As shown in Figure
3A and 3B, the patients with high EGFR and low p-Akt
had significantly better survival (p = 0.030) compared with
other sub-groups; this was not the case for patients EGFR
high/p-Akt high (p = 0.463). On the other hand, analyses
considering high EGFR expression and p-Erk status did
not show any statistically significant findings (Figure 3C,
3D).

DISCUSSION
In our study focusing on ESCC patients, we
measured the expression of EGFR and two phosphorylated
proteins respectively essential for the activation of its two
main downstream signaling pathways, ie p-Akt and p-Erk,
in order to assess their potentiality to predict the outcome
after treatment with nimotuzumab in these patients. Our
results suggest that coexistence of high EGFR expression
and low p-Akt expression in individuals may be associated
with better OS after being treated with h-R3 combined
with RT or CRT.
Overexpression of EGFR has been reported to
be associated with poor prognosis in experimental and
clinical settings [6, 10, 17]. Accordingly, several EGFR

expression was marginally increased in response to EGF
when the EGFR-overexpressing ESCC cell line KYSE30
was treated with EGF [26]. Hitherto, we may deduce that
the EGFR/p-Akt pathway is more crucial than the EGFR/
p-Erk pathway in ESCC cells.
Akt is a very common effector for numerous
upstream signals such as VEGF, and other HER family
members such as HER2 and HER3 [10, 25, 27, 28]. In
ESCC, certain membrane receptors other than the EGFR
may also be able to activate the Akt. Base line p-Akt level
has been demonstrated to have an inverse correlation with
patients’ survival [29]. Yoshioka A et al reported that low
expression of p-Akt was associated with a better prognosis
in the ESCC patients who received chemotherapy
combined with surgery [30].
Hitherto, we bring out a hypothesis about the
mechanism how h-R3 works on EGFR high/p-Akt low
patients (Figure 4). For tumors EGFR high/p-Akt low,
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) besides EGFR have
limited influence on activation of Akt (Figure 4A).
Subsequently, the blockage of EGFR by h-R3 reduces the
activation of Akt and result in tumor death (Figure 4B).
In contrast, if the tumor is EGFR high/p-Akt high, the
RTK signals besides EGFR may play important roles in
activating Akt (Figure 4C). Consequently, the Akt protein
can still be activated by other signals despite the EGFR
blockage by h-R3, and this may lead to tumor progression
(Figure 4D). All above can be explained in the terms of
oncogene addiction and synthetic lethality concepts, which
have been brought out in other cancers [31-34]. For EGFR
addiction, a fraction of primary ESCC cells apparently are
dependent on EGFR activity for survival. The cells die
when suddenly deprived of EGFR. On the other hand,
the weakness of RTKs and inhibition of EGFR resembles
synthetic lethality.
For EGFR high/p-Akt high patients, the activation of
PI3K-Akt-mTOR due to HER2 or HER3 overexpression
has been reported to be one of the possible mechanisms
causing resistance to EGFR blockage [35]. These results
are in agreement with the hypothesis postulated in this
paper. We can not exclude so far the possibility that
tumors EGFR high/p-Akt high would be sensitive to the
combination treatment using anti-EGFR inhibitors plus
either anti-HER2, anti-HER3 or anti-mTOR antagonists
[36].
It should be noted that this study had examined only
a group of patients, which were treated with h-R3 and
RT or CRT. We didn’t refer to the patients treated with
hR-3 only or RT/CRT only. However, we are currently
conducting a prospective, randomized and double-blinded
clinical trial (NCT01232374) to compare concurrent
chemoradiation and h-R3 to chemoradiation alone in
esophageal SCC that may distinguish effects from RT/
CRT from those of h-R3. Furthermore, our study just
included a small series of patients with a retrospective
study. So we just report the preliminary clinical result and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

bring out the testable hypothesis.
In conclusion, in the present study was found
a possible relationship between the expression levels
of EGFR, p-Akt, and p-Erk and the outcome after the
combination treatment of h-R3 plus CRT or RT for a group
of 32 ESCC patients. Patients with EGFR high/p-Akt low
tumors had better survival. The possibility of using two
potential protein biomarkers along for outcome prediction
might be a direct consequence of the complicated
phenomena associated with growth factor signaling
networks [37]. More clinical data are needed to confirm
this result and to determine the subgroup of ESCC patients
who would be possibly more sensitive to the treatment
with nimotuzumab or other anti-EGFR drugs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection
From December 2008 to September 2011, we
retrospectively analyzed 66 patients treated with h-R3
concurrently with RT or CRT, and corresponding safety
and 2-year OS data were published previously [16]. The
32 patients selected in the current study were a subset
of patients whose tumor samples (formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded) had been taken before the treatment.
As reported earlier, eligibility criteria for this study also
included the following: histological evidence of invasive
squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus, informed
consent to receive irradiation (RT) or chemoradiation
(CRT), at least one dose of h-R3 without prior treatment
with other targeted agents, white blood cell count of at
least 4.0×109/L, and platelet count of at least 10.0 ×109/L.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay 	
IHC assay was performed using conventional
methods. Briefly, after paraffin microtome sectioning
(4 micrometer) and deparaffinization, endogenous
peroxidase was blocked by 3% H2O2, and antigen
retrieval was completed after being heated in citrate
buffer using microwave oven. The sections were
incubated with primary antibody over-night, then with
secondary antibody. Finally the sections were processed
with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with
hematoxylin. Antibodies against EGFR (Cell Signaling,
USA; working concentration: 1:100), p-Akt (Cell
Signaling, USA; working concentration: 1:40) and p-Erk
(Abcam Ltd, USA; working concentration: 1:50) were
used.

For a semi-quantitative analysis of protein
expression, all stained slides were assessed by two
referenced pathologists (Li Y and Zhou XY, both are
Professors of pathology from and verified by Fudan
University Shanghai Cancer Center) who were blind to the
survival data. Tumor cells were scored by the percentage
of the stained cells from 0 to 100 in increments of 10.
For positive staining in the nuclei, the most intensively
stained region would be first selected with low-power
magnification. The percentage of stained cells would then
be calculated by counting 10 consecutive high-power
fields (×400). For positive staining on the cell membrane
or in the plasma, the percentage of cells stained was
obtained by microscopically examining/analyzing the
entire tissue at low magnification (×100). To evaluate
the relationship between protein expression levels and
OS, patients were classified into high or low expression
group based on whether the percentage of positive cells
(IHC staining) was higher or lower than the median value
obtained for each target protein, respectively[38].
