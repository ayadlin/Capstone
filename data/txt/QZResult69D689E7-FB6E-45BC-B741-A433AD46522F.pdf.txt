ABSTRACT
Neuroblastoma, a rapidly growing yet treatment responsive cancer, is the
third most common cancer of children and the most common solid tumor in infants.
Unfortunately, neuroblastoma that has lost p53 function often has a highly treatmentresistant phenotype leading to tragic outcomes. In the context of neuroblastoma,
the functions of p53 and MYCN (which is amplified in ~25% of neuroblastomas)
are integrally linked because they are mutually transcriptionally regulated, and
because they together regulate the catalytic activity of RNA polymerases. Didymin is
a citrus-derived natural compound that kills p53 wild-type as well as drug-resistant
p53-mutant neuroblastoma cells in culture. In addition, orally administered didymin
causes regression of neuroblastoma xenografts in mouse models, without toxicity
to non-malignant cells, neural tissues, or neural stem cells. RKIP is a Raf-inhibitory
protein that regulates MYCN activation, is transcriptionally upregulated by didymin,
and appears to play a key role in the anti-neuroblastoma actions of didymin. In
this review, we discuss how didymin overcomes drug-resistance in p53-mutant
neuroblastoma through RKIP-mediated inhibition of MYCN and its effects on GRK2,
PKCs, Let-7 micro-RNA, and clathrin-dependent endocytosis by Raf-dependent and
-independent mechanisms. In addition, we will discuss studies supporting potential
clinical impact and translation of didymin as a low cost, safe, and effective oral agent
that could change the current treatment paradigm for refractory neuroblastoma.

INTRODUCTION

function and highly resistant to apoptosis induced by
current therapies [12-14]. This has tragic consequences
for children with aggressive drug-resistant NB, including
high toxicity from chemotherapeutic regimens and high
rates of therapeutic failure. MYCN stimulates while
p53 inhibits the expression of multiple cancer stem-cell
genes, suggesting that targeting MYCN could overcome
the therapy resistant phenotype of recurrent NB [4, 12].
De-novo NB is a highly chemotherapy sensitive neoplasm
that rarely has p53 mutation suggesting that the ability of
amplified MYCN to confer poor prognosis is independent
of p53 [13]. In the highly treatment-resistant phenotype,

Among childhood malignancies, neuroblastomas
(NB) constitute the most common solid tumors in
infants and the third most common class of pediatric
malignancies [1-4]. Most cases of NB are highly curable
and chemo-sensitive, but treatments are significantly
less effective in NB that have increased MYCN activity
(MYCN gene, amplified in 20-25% of NB tumors) [511]. Patients with MYCN amplification often have
incomplete responses to therapy, which leads to relapse.
Furthermore, relapsed NB is frequently deficient in p53

functional loss of p53 amplifies the survival-promoting
effects of MYCN [12-14]. Because there are no effective
pharmacological agents that directly and specifically
inhibit MYCN, agents that can upregulate endogenous
inhibitors of MYCN expression or activity are attractive
for treating resistant NB.
One possible such agent is didymin, a citrus-derived
natural compound that kills NB cells regardless of their
p53 functional status and causes regression of NB tumors
in xenograft models when given orally [15]. Didymin was
not toxic toward either mature neurons or neural stem cells
in newborn mice, suggesting its potential safety for use in
young children, the group that is most frequently affected
by NB. Recently, it was reported that didymin can cause
cell death in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a p53independent manner [16]. The use of chemotherapeutic
drugs such as cisplatin, doxorubicin and vincristine is
highly limited in refractory and relapsed NB because
of frequent loss-of-function mutations in the tumor
suppressor p53 [17, 18]. Therefore, the identification of
signaling pathways through which didymin acts in NB
could potentially improve the effective management of
NB.
Raf-kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is a novel
protein that interacts with MAP/ERK kinases and acts
as an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway [19]. RKIP is an
established metastasis suppressor protein and, given
the role of the MAPK pathway in regulating cancer cell
survival and metastatic potential, RKIP has been the focus
of recent investigations assessing the effects of novel
anticancer agents [19-22]. Loss of p53 leads to increased
activity of multifunctional proteins, such as RLIP76,
which mediate enhanced proliferation, invasion and drug/
radiation resistance in NB [23, 24]. In recent studies, we
found that RKIP, which also regulates MYCN activation,
is transcriptionally upregulated by didymin and appears
to play a key role in the anti-NB actions of didymin [15].
RKIP can also inhibit G-protein coupled receptor
kinase-2 (GRK2), which activates a number of cancercritical pathways and broadly regulates ligand-receptor

signaling through clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE).
It can activate MYC through Raf-independent pathways
[22, 25-29]. Both RKIP and GRK2 can be regulated by
protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes that are active in
resistant NB [30, 31]. These three kinases, as well as
the MYCN-regulated Let-7 micro-RNA, can broadly
regulate down-stream of multiple peptide hormoneligand interactions by modulating CDE [26, 30-33]. The
importance of these pathways in mediating characteristic
apoptosis-resistance in p53-mutant NB or the mechanisms
of didymin action is not known. In this regard, an effective
strategy for targeting NB in genetically identified risk
groups should decrease the incidence of NB as well as
improve survival after initial diagnosis. Therefore, novel
therapeutic strategies to ameliorate the prognosis of NB
patients are required.

DIDYMIN
Didymin is a commercially available (Indofine
Chemical Company, Hillsborough, NJ; > 99% pure by
HPLC) dietary flavonoid glycoside that is derived from
citrus fruits (Figure 1) and has high therapeutic efficacy
in NB [15]. Our studies indicate that didymin inhibits
cell proliferation and induces apoptosis regardless of p53
status, making it a candidate novel therapy for aggressive,
relapsed, or refractory NB. Didymin is orally bioavailable
and highly effective, and does not cause significant toxicity
in normal tissues, including neural tissue and neural stem
cells. We have identified increased expression of RKIP
as a key effect of didymin [15]. RKIP directly inhibits
key cancer-promoting kinases such as GRK2, Rac, and
GSK3β, and these kinases can regulate MYCN expression
through Raf-independent mechanisms (Figures 2 and 3).
In this review, we discuss the role of these pathways in the
therapy-resistant phenotype of p53-null and/or MYCNamplified NB, the signaling mechanisms that mediate the
aggressive and treatment-resistant behavior of refractory
NB, the mechanisms of action of didymin, and key in

these consequences and responses to oxidative stress in
a concentration-dependent manner. Given the results
of our studies with RKIP [15], we expect that most
of the effect of didymin will depend on the presence
of functional RKIP. The possibility that RKIP effects
depend on reduced activity in the PI3K pathway, could
be examined by over-expression of constitutively active
Akt mutants. As an antioxidant, didymin should suppress
cellular levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) products,
resulting in anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic signaling
and transcriptional programs in NB cells (Figure 3). The
antioxidant properties of didymin [43] suggested that it
could have anticancer functions: oxidative stress is known
to inactivate anti-proliferative pathways, including the
tumor suppressor PTEN, and to promote pro-proliferative
kinase signaling through the PI3K, MAPK and Akt/mTOR
pathways [39]. One possible explanation for the effect of
didymin is its chemical structure. This structure could
allow didymin to rescue cells from oxidative damage by
directly scavenging free radicals through hydrogen atom
donation or indirectly by activating antioxidant enzymes.
Interestingly, didymin inhibited the growth of NSCLC in
a p53-independent manner with its predominant effects
mediated by the Fas/Fas L apoptotic pathway [16].

ANTIOXIDANT EFFECTS OF DIDYMIN
The general structure of flavonoids gives them
antioxidant activity through free-radical de-localization to
reduce the toxicity of reactive-oxygen species (ROS). In
addition, many fragmentation products of flavonoids are
substrates or regulators of drug-metabolizing and stressresponsive enzymes that can exert biological antioxidant
effects [34-38]. These enzymes include the p450 system,
glutathione-linked enzymes, drug-efflux transporters, and
associated regulatory proteins. Because PKC, Ras, PI3K,
Ral, p53, and MYC are activated by oxidative stress
[39-41], generalized suppression of oxidative stress by
didymin could reduce the activity or expression of these
cancer survival, proliferation, and invasion pathways.
Our findings that levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE),
a down-stream marker of oxidative stress, increased
in p53-mutated resistant NB cells [23] suggest that
generalized oxidative stress as characterized by increased
levels of OH• , such as O2-•, lipid-hydroperoxide radical,
mitochondrial membrane potential [42], glutathione levels,
catalytic activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxidedismutase, catalase, glutathione-peroxidase, glutathione
S-transferase) and membrane transporters (Ralbp1,
P-glycoprotein, multidrug-resistance associated protein)
should also be altered in p53-deficient cells. In addition,
oxidative-stress responsive signaling and transcriptional
regulatory proteins such as PKC, Ras, PI3K, Ral, p53,
and MYC should be increased. We predict that the
antioxidant function of didymin will reduce each of

analyses of our proteomic studies that focused on cancer-related pathways active in NB cells. The MAPK/ERK pathway (also known as
the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathways) is a cell-signaling pathway that plays a vital role in normal cell division and growth. Mutations that
result in constitutive activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway have been implicated in a broad range of solid tumors and are associated with
tumor resistance to standard cancer therapies. Inhibition of MEK, which is pivotal protein kinase in the MAPK/ERK pathway, may block
growth of solid tumors and interfere with development of resistance. Didymin inhibits MYCN through Raf-dependent and -independent
mechanisms by inhibiting CDE through RKIP, GRK, PKC, and the Let-7 micro-RNA.

AP1, or ATF2, it is possible that the changes in RKIP are
a consequence rather than a cause of MYCN depletion.
Although this is unlikely because RKIP knockdown
partially negates didymin activity, it cannot be ruled out
because the effect of Raf inhibition by RKIP was not
studied. In addition, RKIP interacting proteins including
STC2, PI3KR1, MED10 and TRAF6 are transcriptionally
regulated by MYCN and p53, and could modulate RKIP
activity. PPARγ has been shown to down-regulate MYCN
and regulate cell growth and differentiation in NB cells.
The transcription of AP1 and MYC are mutually regulated
[44-47]. ATF2 can regulate MYC transcription and vice
versa, and ATF may also regulate AP1 transcription
through activation by PKC.
GRK2 has been shown to be active in NB cell lines
[28, 29, 48, 49]. We predict that didymin-mediated RKIP
upregulation reverses apoptosis-resistance by inhibiting
CDE through effects on GRK2. Other pathways inhibited

by RKIP are NFκB, GRK2, Rac, and Wnt. RKIP may
inhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and
activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by inhibiting
NFκB in other cancers [50, 51]. Inhibition of EMT by
didymin suggests a possible role of NFκB, but there is little
evidence for a significant role of NFκB in NB. GSK3β in
the Wnt pathway, known to be active in NB, is mutually
regulated by MYC [51-53], but its role in NB or didymin
mechanisms is not known. Phosphorylation of RKIP at S153
promotes its dimerization, which switches its inhibitory
activity from Raf1 to GRK2 [28]. GRK2 activates MYC
through the Rac/PAK/MEK/ERK/Myc pathway and
may inhibit cell migration induced by didymin. GRK2
also directly activates ligand-receptor pair endocytosis
through CDE [29]. Blocking CDE by depleting RLIP76
causes apoptosis in both p53-wildtype and mutated NB
and leads to regression of NB xenografts [23]. RLIP76 is
a stress-responsive anti-apoptotic glutathione-electrophile

conjugate (GS-E) transporter that links the oxidative-stress
defenses to CDE and survival through peptide-hormones
[39-41]; thus, RKIP inhibition could also mediate
apoptosis and inhibit invasion by inhibiting the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) through phosphorylation
at S991 and Y998 [54]. EGFR is over-expressed in NB,
activating PI3K to promote cell proliferation in NB [55];
both EGFR and RLIP76 signaling ultimately feed to MYC
[39]. The Let-7 (lethal-7) micro-RNA is another MYCdependent pathway through which RKIP could inhibit
CDE and invasion [32]. Let-7 and MYC are mutually
regulated, and Let-7 inhibits metastasis through a pathway
consisting of BACH1 (a basic region-leucine zipper
transcription factor) which is regulated by endocytosis,
suppresses p53-mediated cell senescence, and regulates
oxidative-stress responses [22, 56]. Let-7 also regulates
MMP1, a pro-angiogenic matrix metalloproteinase that
regulates CDE [57]. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulated
by Let-7 [32, 58], but the mechanism underlying their
activity and their functional significance in NB is not fully
understood. Previous studies provide strong evidence for
a mechanistic role of RKIP induction in the actions of
didymin, but how the transcription of RKIP is regulated by
didymin is not known. We predict that the observed down-

regulation of MYCN by didymin will be due to complex
feed-back mechanisms that regulate the transcription of
MYCN through one or more of the above transcription
factors, and that defining these mechanisms could identify
novel targeting agents that would be synergistic with or
antagonize didymin. The significance and validity of these
findings could eventually be tested in human clinical trials.

TARGETING DIDYMIN TO TREAT P53NULL NB
Surgical resection of localized NB is effective only
in the initial stages; advanced and metastatic NB require
aggressive multi-modal treatment with chemotherapy
and radiation [59-62]. Although the vast majority of
NB are chemosensitive and curable, those with MYCN
amplification or p53-mutations are considered high-risk
because of their aggressive behavior, tendency to relapse,
and resistance to therapy. Children with high-risk NB
have a substantially lower cure rate despite treatment with
more aggressive and toxic therapies, and even the most
promising approaches are limited by side effects during
the course of treatment. There is no consensus regarding
optimal therapeutic agents for p53-mutant NB. Although
overall cure rates are high in NB, the ~20% children with

MYCN amplification have a poorer prognosis because
of intrinsic or acquired drug-resistance. Although p53
function is almost always normal at diagnosis and the
disease is quite sensitive to therapy, tumor cells from
recurrent NB are frequently deficient in p53 function due
to mutations or deletions. We hypothesize that didymin
will offer a highly effective, non-toxic approach to
treatment of MYCN amplified and/or p53-null NB that
will change the treatment paradigm for this therapyresistant disease and reduce treatment related toxicity,
morbidity and mortality.

upregulation of hemeoxygenase, catalase, and superoxide
dismutase antioxidant genes. Furthermore, these effects
were associated with reduced oxidative stress in SK-NSH cells in-vitro. These cell culture studies have provided
important insights but do not prove the in vivo efficacy
of any tested agent [68]. Citrus bergamia (bergamot) is
a small tree belonging to the family Rutaceae. Recently,
bergamot juice attracted attention because of its
remarkable content of flavonoids [69, 70]. Navarra et al.
evaluated the effect of bergamot juice in vitro and in a
spontaneous metastatic NB SCID mouse model. They
showed that bergamot juice significantly affected SKN-SH and LAN-1 cell proliferation and reduced cell
adhesiveness and invasion in vitro, but failed to reduce
primary tumor weight in vivo in NB xenograft model [71].
Human malignant NB is characterized by poor
differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation of immature
neuroblasts. Retinoids at low doses are capable of inducing
differentiation, while the flavonoids epigallocatechin-3gallate and genistein at relatively high dose can induce
apoptosis. Das et al. used a combination of retinoids and
flavonoids to control growth of SH-SY5Y NB cells, and
found that combinatorial treatment induced neuronal
differentiation concomitant with downregulation of
telomerase activity and N-Myc. But this treatment also
led to over-expression of neurofilament protein and
subsequently increased apoptosis in the differentiated
cells. Although these studies suggested that combining a
retinoid and a flavonoid worked synergistically to control
the growth of NB cells in-vitro, the combination was not
explored in vivo [72]. Thus, targeted therapeutics for NB
developed from phytochemicals (daucosterol, pectolinarin,
and astragalin), bergamot, or retinoids do not appear to
be as effective as didymin in comparable experiments in
vivo. The greater effectiveness of targeted therapy using
didymin can be understood in terms of a chemical as well
as biochemical signaling model (Figures 2 and 3).

DIDYMIN EXERTS ANTI-NEOPLASTIC
EFFECTS IN VIVO
Didymin was shown to have in vivo efficacy against
MYCN-amplified NB xenografts when given by oral
gavage at 2 mg/kg body weight on alternate days for
sixty days beginning 10 days after tumor inoculations
(at which time all animals had palpable tumor ~ 40
mm2). Treated mice had significantly smaller tumors
as compared to controls, which showed uncontrolled
tumor growth. Tumor weight was reduced by more than
50% at 60 days without overt toxicity. The final tumor
weight on day 60 was 0.91 g in the didymin-treated group
compared to 1.97 g in controls (p < 0.001) [15]. These
studies demonstrate sustained regression of NB xenografts
following treatment with the targeted agent, didymin.
Didymin caused no weight loss or significant changes in
blood counts or metabolic tests. The serum concentration
of didymin 1 h after an oral dose of 2 mg/kg was 2.1 +
0.3 µM, and LC-MS studies revealed a complex mixture
of degradation products, characteristic of other flavonoids
[63-65]. Histopathological examination of paraffinembedded tumor xenograft sections revealed lower levels
of a proliferation marker (Ki67), an angiogenesis marker
(CD31), and MYCN expression in didymin-treated
NB xenografts as compared to untreated, which further
supports the in vitro results [15].
The effectiveness of didymin-targeted therapy
compares favorably with other promising targeted agents
in NB. Plants have long been an attractive source of
novel anticancer drugs. Indeed, approximately 50% of
anticancer drugs are natural or semi-synthetic products.
Epidemiologic studies provided evidence that citrus
consumption is associated with reduced all cancer
incidence [66, 67]. Cirsium setidens and Aster scaber
are perennial edible plants that are rich in flavonoids
and grow wild in the mountainous regions of Korea.
Studies from the Kwon laboratory demonstrated that
the neuroprotective effects and mechanism of action of
three major phytochemicals (daucosterol, pectolinarin,
and astragalin) isolated from edible plants against H2O2induced cell death of human NB SK-N-SH cells occurred
through down-regulation of MAPK pathways and

RELATIVE EFFICACY OF DIDYMIN
Didymin is a flavone that is common in citrus fruits
like oranges, lemons, mandarin and bergamot. Given the
absence of any pharmacokinetic data on didymin in the
literature, it has been difficult to determine the appropriate
dosage of didymin for in vivo studies. Therefore, we
evaluated didymin at concentrations of 1-20 mg/kg
given orally on alternate days for 8 weeks in nude mice
bearing NB xenografts. Mice given 2 mg/kg didymin
had significantly smaller average tumor volumes when
compared to vehicle-treated control mice. All of the
didymin-treated mice survived to the end of our study. No
signs of toxicity, as judged by parallel monitoring of body
weight and tissue sections, were observed in didymintreated mice [15]. This degree of efficacy and concomitant
lack of toxicity compares favorably with other biologically
targeted preclinical approaches (Table 1).

RKIP is involved in several cell signaling cascades,
and is a specific inhibitor of the MAPK signaling pathway
[73]. It directly interacts with both Raf-1 and MEK and
disrupts the Raf-1/MEK interaction, thereby preventing
MEK activation and its downstream targets [74]. Hung
et al. demonstrated that didymin has an antiproliferative
effect in lung cancer cells. This work was supported
by xenograft studies that have shown that didymin
delays tumor growth in nude mice, and that the Fas/
FasL apoptotic system is involved in didymin-mediated
apoptosis [16]. Phthalates, including butyl benzyl
phthalate, di‑n‑butyl phthalate, and di‑2‑ethylhexyl
phthalate, are used as softeners and plasticizers [75].
Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure of
breast cancer cells to phthalate esters, may contribute to
the progression of cancer by enhancing cell proliferation,
migration, and invasion [76]. Didymin, a dietary flavonoid
glycoside present in citrus fruits, demonstrates antioxidant
and anticancer properties, and Hsu et al. revealed that
didymin was capable of preventing phthalate esterassociated cancer aggravation [77]. Lin et al showed
that didymin significantly ameliorated chronic liver
injury and collagen deposition and attenuated the
mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by
release of cytochrome C. These actions were mediated by
inhibition of the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways by
regulation of RKIP expression. These results also showed
that didymin significantly increased RKIP expression both
in liver tissues and HSC-T6 cells (rat hepatic stellate cells)
[78, 79]. A follow-up study from the same group revealed
that didymin treatment significantly reduced CYP2E1
activity, LPO levels, ROS generation, NO production, and
pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFα, IL6, and IL1β) in liver tissues and RAW264.7 cells (mouse leukemic
macrophage cells), but enhanced the activity of hepatic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

antioxidant enzymes. Further studies showed that didymin
significantly inhibited the NFκB and MAPK pathways,
representing a protective effect of didymin against CCl4induced hepatotoxicity [80]. Morelli et al. showed that the
antioxidant property of didymin stimulated superoxide
dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity
in neuronal cells exposed with H2O2. This suggests that
didymin may be a potential therapeutic molecule for the
treatment of neurodegenerative disorders associated with
oxidative-stress [81].

EFFECT OF DIDYMIN IN NORMAL
MOUSE BRAIN (NEURO-MORPHOLOGY
AND STEM CELL POPULATIONS)
Because the brains of children are still developing,
the effects of didymin on the brain must be evaluated
before it can be moved forward as a potential therapeutic
modality for NB. Singhal et al performed a preliminary
in vivo assessment of didymin’s effects in the areas of
the brain that have high rates of neural cell proliferation,
such as the dentate gyrus, and areas with stem cell
populations, such as the subventricular zone. Didymin
did not affect neural progenitor cell proliferation or
neuronal differentiation rates, as revealed by a lack of
any significant changes in expression of Ki67, DCX, or
NeuN in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone.
Normal neuronal tissue expresses low levels of N-Myc
and abundant levels of RKIP, a state that is reversed
upon oncogenic transformation after which tumor cells
display high N-Myc expression and low RKIP expression.
In wild-type mice, didymin treatment further increased
the expression of tumor suppressor RKIP and decreased
N-Myc levels. Therefore it is likely that didymin

contributes to a basal protective effect against oncogenic
transformation in normal tissue. That didymin had these
effects on N-Myc and RKIP expression in normal mice
brain without affecting the mature neuronal and neural
stem cell population, together with the ability of didymin
to exert similar effects in NB xenografts [15], strongly
indicate the mechanistic relevance of didymin for both
primary and tertiary management of NB. These findings
further support that didymin is unlikely to have toxic
effects on normal brain tissues, despite lowering N-Myc
and increasing RKIP expression.

effort can be saved in developing an effective means of
administration (i.e., it is unlikely taste modifying additives
will be needed for oral formulations for children). Instead,
it is likely didymin can be administered in milk or other
liquid diets or formulations for infants and children,
for whom it usually it not feasible to use derivatized
preparations such as pills and creams. Our studies have
revealed that didymin is highly effective against NB both
in vitro and in mouse xenografts in vivo [15]. Importantly,
we have demonstrated that didymin inhibits multiple
targets that are critical for driving NB (PI3K, N-Myc
and vimentin), but not related targets that are important
for neuronal homeostasis such as Sox2, Nestin, DCX,
and NeuN. Didymin treatment was tolerable and appears
to be non-toxic, as revealed by DCX staining of newly
formed neurons, NeuN staining of mature neurons in the
hippocampal dentate gyrus, Ki67 staining of proliferating
neural progenitors, and Sox-2 staining of neural stem
cells in the subventricular zone of brains in control and
didymin-treated mice. High-throughput proteomics
approaches have identified N-Myc and its regulator, RKIP,
as a strong candidate targets for the activity of didymin.
N-Myc is a growth-stimulating protein that is typically
overexpressed in NB. Therefore, we postulate that didymin
exerts its anticancer effects by suppressing N-Myc through
RKIP. We also anticipate that RKIP and N-Myc are
mechanistically linked to didymin, and didymin will cause
both N-Myc dependent and independent inhibition of the
growth of NB cells and NB stem cells.
Mechanistically, the inhibition of N-Myc by
didymin as shown through protein, mRNA, and promoterreporter assays was a hallmark of our studies [15].
Amplification and over-expression of N-Myc is associated
with both the incidence and refractoriness of NB [82-84].
Hence, the ability of didymin to inhibit N-Myc at both
the transcriptional and translational levels reflects its
potential utility as a novel interventional strategy for NB.
In addition, didymin has both fundamental mechanistic
and clinical- translational significance due to its potential
to regulate critical nodes of NB signaling that impact the
incidence and progression of NB (Figure 3). The overexpression of N-Myc represents a significant enabling
molecular event in the incidence and progression of
NB, whereas modulation of oxidative-stress impacts the
strength of signaling through phosphatases such as PTEN
and downstream kinases. Studies by Singhal et al. on p53wildtype and p53-mutant refractory NB have shown that
MAP is upregulated in p53-mutant NB, and contributes to
the regulation of the toxic effects of ROS and apoptosisresistance in these cells [23].
The present review collectively provides a strong
rationale for the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
properties of the novel flavonoid didymin in NB regardless
of the p53 status of a given tumor. These studies also
provide evidence that didymin is an orally bioavailable
non-toxic compound that could fill the need for effective

STRUCTURE-ACTIVITYRELATIONSHIP
STUDY
FOR
MECHANISM OF DIDYMIN AND N-MYC
INTERACTION
To better understand how didymin might exert
its effects on N-Myc-mediated transcription, Singhal et
al used structure- and ligand-based computer modeling
to investigate whether N-Myc interacts directly with
didymin. They sought to use a three-dimensional
homology model of N-Myc and didymin, generated using
the Schrodinger software suite, to validate the active
ligand binding mode, based on mutation analysis, in order
to better understand the mechanism of action of didymin
and to spur rational design for lead optimization (Figure
4).

DISCUSSION
The causes of NB incidence and progression are
topics of intensive investigation. NB is a developmental
tumor of young children arising from the embryonic
sympathoadrenal lineage of the neural crest, is the
primary cause of death from pediatric cancer for children
between the ages of one and five years, and accounts
for <15% of all deaths from pediatric cancer. Despite
recent progress in understanding the biology of NB,
there remains a paucity of effective treatments. Important
tumor-promoting pathways in NB include activation of
N-Myc, loss of the tumor suppressor p53, and cellular
acclimatization to elevated levels of oxidative stress [24, 14, 36]. Increased oxidative stress leads to generation
of ROS and inactivation of phosphatase such as PTEN,
which in turn leads to increased activation of intracellular
kinase signaling [36, 44-46]. Current treatments for NB
have major drawbacks, including lack of effectiveness in
p53-mutant tumors, lack of specificity for NB cells, and
severe side effects.
We have identified a citrus-derived flavonoid,
didymin that addresses each of these drawbacks. Didymin
is a palatable dietary flavonoid that is orally active,
making it a candidate for convenient oral administration
in children. Because didymin is non-bitter, time and

therapies for drug-resistant NB, and provide a generalized
method for overcoming resistance mediated by loss of p53
function. These findings have elucidated a role for RKIP
in the mechanisms of didymin action, but whether this
effect is mediated primarily through Raf-inhibition, the
activity of other down-stream pathways, or Rac, GRK2,
PKC is not yet known. We believe that the effects of RKIP
in these pathways represent multifaceted p53-independent
signaling mechanisms that can regulate MYCN through
interference with peptide-hormone signaling at the
level of CDE. Further studies would provide valuable
knowledge regarding the mechanisms through which p53
loss mediates drug-resistance in NB, potential strategies to
attack this problem, and crucial information regarding the
mechanisms of action, spectrum of in-vivo efficacy, and
basic pharmacology of didymin.

molecules like didymin that enhance RKIP expression [8991]. In our studies, we observed upregulation of N-Myc
after the knock-down of RKIP in NB [15]. RKIP is an
important mediator of the anticancer effects of didymin,
but the roles of various effectors of didymin, such as
Akt, PI3K, GSK3β, and N-Myc, in RKIP-positive and
-negative tumors remains to be established by further
studies involving knock-down or over-expression of
the respective proteins. Also, future studies are needed
to reveal whether the differential regulation of N-Myc
consequent to RKIP knock-down is mediated through
GSK3β in NB cells. Such studies would benefit the
rational development of didymin formulations as well
as personalized combinations of anticancer drugs with
didymin to achieve better clinical response in patients with
differing tumor genotypes and drug-sensitivity profiles.
Our findings regarding the novel, safe, and palatable
dietary flavonoid didymin have revealed its anticancer
properties irrespective of N-Myc amplification and p53
mutation status in NB. Thus, didymin represents a highly
promising flavonoid with potential clinical significance
to effectively prevent the incidence of NB and as an
innovative approach for new treatment strategies proposed
by the New Approaches for Neuroblastoma Therapy
Consortium.

CONCLUSIONS
Selecting appropriate compounds or agents for
study and development is a major challenge in evaluating
natural herbal compounds that may have inherent
anticancer properties. We have overcome this challenge
by developing in silico algorithms for predicting the
anticancer activity of natural compounds. Our algorithms
are based on the theory that cell cycle and receptor-ligand
signaling are linked by the mercapturic acid pathway
(MAP), because the rate of endocytosis-dependent
internalization of receptor-ligand pairs is directly
proportional to the rate of flux of metabolites in the MAP
[24]. Our model predicts the rate of flow of metabolites in
the MAP according to kinetic constants for the enzymes
in the pathway, the concentrations of intermediates, and
the inhibitory or stimulatory effects of key signaling
nodes. Using this model, we have successfully predicted
the anticancer activity of the novel and potent compound,
didymin in NB [15]. Our studies revealed that didymin
can effectively target NB, which prompted studies on
the effects of didymin on critical signaling proteins that
regulate cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and
apoptosis in NB. The mechanisms of action of didymin
could involve a number of downstream mediators
given that didymin has potential anti-oxidant properties
[43]. ROS stimulate the activation of critical signaling
pathways, including the MAPK pathway [85], and the
modulation of ROS can lead to a plethora of effects on
cellular proliferation and apoptosis [86, 87].
The differential regulation of RKIP and N-Myc was
a salient finding of our study given the opposing roles
played by these proteins in the incidence and progression
of NB [15, 86, 88]. Silencing of RKIP leads to partial
reversal of the survival of NB cells. Given evidence
pointing to the prominent role of RKIP in regulating
the central axes of proliferative and apoptotic signaling
through regulation of Raf, GSK3β, and cyclin D1, studies
by Al-Mulla et al. are important in directing the study of

RELEVANCE TO HUMAN HEALTH
NB is a prevalent but therapeutically challenging
pediatric cancer, accounts for 15 percent of all pediatric
cancers, and is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor
in children [59]. Amplification of N-Myc plays a role in the
pathogenesis of primary NB, whereas acquired mutations
of p53 lead to refractory NB. Identification of dietary
compounds that can target N-Myc and exert anticancer
effects independent of p53 status would be significant
in the management of NB. Therefore, we investigated
the anticancer properties of didymin in NB. Didymin
effectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis
irrespective of p53 status in NB. Importantly, didymin
inhibited N-Myc, as confirmed at the protein, mRNA, and
transcriptional levels by promoter-reporter assays. Our
studies also indicate that didymin is absorbed effectively
after oral administration [15]. Thus, didymin represents a
novel and relevant dietary agent for treatment of NB and
in this context, further studies on its mechanisms of action
should help to develop and test various didymin doses and
formulations for use in children. Success in identifying
novel mechanisms for regulating cellular levels of MYCN,
delineating the mechanisms of action and of resistance,
and eventual clinical deployment of a low cost, safe,
and effective oral treatment for drug-resistant NB can
change the current treatment paradigm, can help cure
children afflicted with this disease, and alleviate treatment
related toxicities and stress. Overall, our study of didymin
represents a “first of its kind investigation” toward
29436

developing an effective interventional strategy for NB
[15]. Importantly, didymin is well tolerated by both mature
neuronal cells and neural stem cells while being selectively
toxic for NB cells, which, along with its inhibitory effect
on the oncogene N-Myc and stimulatory effect on the
tumor suppressor RKIP makes it an ideal candidate for
targeting both primary and tertiary NB management.
The palatability, safety, and oral availability of didymin
further support its translational anticancer potential. Thus,
didymin represents a mechanistically sound flavonoid of
specific relevance for further development towards control
of human NB.

natural compound could be delivered on a long-term
basis or to susceptible populations. This type of approach
would fundamentally change the management of NB and
potentially open the door to preventative strategies in
high-risk populations.

HIGHLIGHTS
Didymin is a novel, non-toxic, and highly relevant
citrus flavonoid that has potential utility for effectively
targeting NB in children as it can prevent the growth of
NB that has both N-Myc amplification and mutant p53.
Didymin is not bitter, in contrast to most other
flavonoids. This gives great flexibility in developing
formulations that would be easy to orally administer to
children.
Didymin upregulates RKIP levels and inhibits
N-Myc at the protein, mRNA, and transcriptional level.
Thus, the anticancer potential of didymin likely arises
from its multi-specific anticancer mechanism of action.
Overall, didymin appears to be a palatable, welltolerated, and effective alternative to conventional
treatment approaches for NB.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
NB is the most common childhood solid tumor
originating outside the nervous system and the most
common tumor in infants. Despite advances in the
understanding of the molecular basis of NB, effective
interventional strategies have remained out of reach.
The amplification of N-Myc plays a primary role in
the pathogenesis of NB, and further acquisition of p53
mutations leads to refractory and relapsed NB tumors.
Based on a molecular modeling approach, we identified
the citrus-derived compound didymin as a potential antiNB agent. Our studies revealed that the potent anticancer
properties of didymin are mediated by down-regulation
of N-Myc and up-regulation of the metastasis suppressor
RKIP. The effects do not depend on p53 status of the tumor
cell, indicating potential broad efficacy of didymin [15].
Furthermore, these studies indicate that didymin is safe,
with no measurable effect on neurogenesis in the normal
brain. The palatability of didymin as compared to other
flavonoids, which are often bitter, together with its ability
to be absorbed following oral administration, further
support its potential translational impact as an anticancer
agent. Our further studies will evaluate the mechanism
by which didymin blocks the growth of NB, determine
the optimal dosing conditions, and further test its efficacy
against clinically relevant spontaneous NB tumor models.
These key studies will set the stage for clinical translation
of didymin, which has the potential to significantly lower
the morbidity and mortality associated with NB and
potentially to have utility against other cancers.
Loss of p53 function and increased cellular MYCN
are frequent characteristics of recurring NB that play a
pivotal role in mediating drug-resistance. Our further
studies will answer questions regarding the mechanisms
underlying this remarkable effect using state-of- the-art
technology to increase knowledge of cellular mechanisms
that regulate MYCN function in NB, and begin to
define the breadth of applicability in treatment as well
as secondary prevention of NB. Although didymin itself
represents a particularly innovative therapeutic angle, it
could also be easily combined with traditional therapies
as an adjuvant. If successful, this palatable non-toxic
