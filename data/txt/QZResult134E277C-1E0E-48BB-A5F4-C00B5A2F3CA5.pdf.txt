Abstract
The use of targeted therapeutics directed against BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma improves progression-free survival in many patients; however, acquired drug resistance remains a major medical challenge. By far,
the most common clinical resistance mechanism involves reactivation of the MAPK (RAF/MEK/ERK) pathway by
a variety of mechanisms. Thus, targeting ERK itself has emerged as an attractive therapeutic concept, and several
ERK inhibitors have entered clinical trials. We sought to preemptively determine mutations in ERK1/2 that confer
resistance to either ERK inhibitors or combined RAF/MEK inhibition in BRAFV600-mutant melanoma. Using a
random mutagenesis screen, we identiﬁed multiple point mutations in ERK1 (MAPK3) and ERK2 (MAPK1) that
could confer resistance to ERK or RAF/MEK inhibitors. ERK inhibitor–resistant alleles were sensitive to RAF/
MEK inhibitors and vice versa, suggesting that the future development of alternating RAF/MEK and ERK inhibitor
regimens might help circumvent resistance to these agents. Cancer Res; 74(23); 7079–89. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
BRAF is mutated in approximately 50% of melanomas,
resulting in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway
((B)RAF–MEK–ERK; ref. 1). Inhibitors targeting RAF and MEK
(a key downstream effector kinase in the pathway) improve the
survival of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, and are thus
used clinically for this indication (2–4). In particular, combined
RAF/MEK inhibition appears to improve progression-free
survival compared with RAF or MEK monotherapy (2, 5).
Despite these therapeutic successes, nearly all patients develop
progressive disease that shows resistance to these agents (2, 6).
Multiple studies describing mechanisms of resistance to
RAF/MEK inhibition have been published. Reactivation of the
MAPK pathway through a variety of means, including alternatively spliced BRAF, NRAS or MEK1/2 mutations, MAP3K8
upregulation, or receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, is the most
common clinical drug resistance mechanism (7–11). Because
all of these alterations converge on sustained activation of ERK,
the clinical development of small-molecule ERK inhibitors is of
considerable interest. More generally, ERK signaling represents a key downstream effector of RAS mutations in many
cancer types, suggesting that ERK inhibitors might eventually
have multiple indications in oncology.

ERK1 and ERK2 proteins are 84% identical and comprise
the only known substrates of MEK. MEK activity on ERK results
in dual phosphorylation on the Thr-Glu-Tyr motif of
ERK1T202/Y204 and ERK2T185/Y187 that fully activates ERK kinase
activity. Conversely, ERKs are negatively regulated by dephosphorylation, which is accomplished by dual speciﬁcity phosphatases (DUSP; refs. 12, 13). DUSPs also become induced by
ERK signaling, creating a negative feedback loop (14). Other
downstream ERK effectors include kinases such as RSK and
MSK, cytoskeletal molecules, nucleoporins, and transcription
factors (e.g., c-FOS, ELK-1, ETS-1, and MITF). Oncogenic
dysregulation of this ERK program may profoundly impact
cell proliferation and survival (15).
Several small-molecule ERK inhibitors have entered clinical
trials (16, 17). Given the importance of secondary kinase
mutations as resistance mechanisms in many oncogene-driven
cancers, we wished to discover mutations in ERK that confer
resistance to ERK inhibitors. We reasoned that at least some
such ERK mutations might also confer resistance to RAF/MEK
inhibitors. (In this regard, these studies might also identify
constitutively active variants of ERK, which have remained
elusive despite intensive study.) Random mutagenesis screens
have successfully identiﬁed clinically relevant resistance alleles
(18, 19) in multiple kinase oncogene-driven malignancies.
Thus, we employed random mutagenesis in BRAF-mutant
melanoma cells to identify mutations in ERK1 or ERK2 that
could confer resistance to MAPK inhibitors.

obtained from Chemietek. PLX4720 was obtained from Selleck.
SCH772984 was synthesized by J & W PharmLab. Lentiviral
production and infection were performed as previously
described (19).
Random mutagenesis
Mutagenesis screens were performed as described previously (19) with additional detail in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Drug screens with mutagenized libraries
A375 cells (8  106) expressing tet-inducible GFP, wild-type
ERK1/ERK2, or mutant library ERK1/ERK2 were plated in T150
ﬂasks with VX-11e (2 mmol/L), trametinib (3 nmol/L), or trametinib þ dabrafenib (1 nmol/L þ 10 nmol/L) and doxycyline
(DOX; 1 mg/mL) for 2 to 4 weeks until resistant cells emerged. At
that time, genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated (DNeasy kit;
Qiagen). Exogenous ERK1/2 was ampliﬁed by the PCR using
vector-speciﬁc primers (Supplementary Materials and Methods) and AccuPrime PFX supermix (Life Technologies). Individual colonies were collected and transferred into 96-well
plates and expanded. Genomic DNA was isolated, and PCR was
performed as above, then analyzed by Sanger sequencing.
Library generation and massively parallel sequencing
Massively parallel sequencing of PCR products from mutagenesis screens was performed as described previously (19).
Additional detail is provided in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Viability assays
A375, WM266.4, or SKMEL-19 cells were plated in 96-well
plates, with six replicates for each drug. VX-11e (2 mmol/L),
trametinib (3 nmol/L), dabrafenib (50 nmol/L), trametinib þ
dabrafenib (1 nmol/L þ 10 nmol/L), or SCH772984 (1 mmol/L
or 0.5 mmol/L) were added 24 hours later with or without DOX
(1 mg/mL). Drugs were diluted 1:1,000 from stock concentrations in DMSO. Viability was analyzed 72 to 96 hours later by
CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay
(Promega). The raw absorbance values were normalized to
vehicle-treated controls after background subtraction and
graphed as percent viability, with vehicle-treated cells at
100%. Heat maps were created from normalized viability values
using GENE-E (21).
Western blotting
A375 cells were exposed to DOX with or without VX-11e (2
mmol/L), or trametinib (3 nmol/L), then harvested in RIPA
buffer, and run on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were analyzed using the
following antibodies: phosphoERK1T202/Y204/ERK2T185/Y187,
ERK1/2, phosphoELK-1S383 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
phosphoRSKS380, RSK, tubulin, DUSP6 (Cell Signaling Technology), cyclin D1 (Thermo Scientiﬁc), and V5 epitope
(Abcam). Relative expression was calculated by dividing the
relative densities of each phoshoELK-1 band by total ERK (or
V5) using Image J. Values were normalized to untreated wildtype, which was set at 1.

Results
ERK1/ERK2 random mutagenesis
To discover mutations in ERK1 or ERK2 that may confer
resistance to MAPK inhibitors, a six-part random mutagenesis
screen was performed. Here, we mutagenized ERK1 and ERK2
within the pDONR223 vector using a mutator strain of E. coli
(22). The resulting mutagenized cDNA library was transferred
into a DOX-inducible vector (pCW57.1), which was infected
into A375 (BRAF-mutant) melanoma cells that are sensitive to
MAP kinase pathway inhibitors. These cells were cultured in
the presence of either the ERK inhibitor VX-11e (23), the MEK
inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212), or the combination of
trametinib and the RAF inhibitor, dabrafenib (GSK2118436),
in the presence of DOX. In all cases, drug-resistant A375
daughter populations emerged within 2 to 4 weeks. Genomic
DNA was isolated, and ERK1 or ERK2 cDNA was ampliﬁed by
the PCR followed by massively parallel sequencing (see Materials and Methods). In parallel experiments, a series of VX-11e–
resistant ERK2 colonies were isolated, and ERK2 cDNA was
analyzed by Sanger sequencing.
Overall, we identiﬁed 33 putative resistance variants spanning 28 amino acids in ERK1, and 24 substitutions affecting
20 amino acids in ERK2 (above a 5% massively parallel
sequencing false discovery rate; see Supplementary Materials
and Methods; Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1A–F; and Supplementary Table S1). Sanger sequencing of 23 VX-11e–resistant
colonies identiﬁed seven ERK2 mutations in ﬁve amino acids,
two of which were also identiﬁed in the mutagenesis screens.
We have no evidence that these mutagenesis screens were
saturating; therefore, additional candidate ERK1/2 resistance
mutations may remain to be identiﬁed. Nonetheless, our
screening results suggested that a diverse range of ERK mutations might be associated with resistance to these inhibitors.
We observed ﬁve analogous resistance alleles between
ERK1 and ERK2 in cells resistant to the ERK inhibitor in both
the screen and in isolated colonies (ERK1Y53H/ERK2Y36H/N,

relatively little overlap between the ERK inhibitor screens
and the RAF/MEK inhibitor screens (three overlapping

alleles of 67 total signiﬁcant nucleotide alterations), raising
the possibility that mutations identiﬁed through RAF/MEK
inhibitor treatment might be resistant to one or both of
these agents, but not to ERK inhibitors (and vice versa).
Several ERK codons had multiple distinct amino acid substitutions (these include ERK1Y53C/H, ERK1G54A/S,
ERK2Y36N/H, and ERK2P58L/S/T), suggesting the importance
of these residues for inhibition by ATP-competitive ERK
inhibitors.
In general, candidate ERK1/2 resistance mutations arising in
the ERK inhibitor resistance screen clustered within the ATP/
drug binding pocket, suggesting that these variants might
interfere with drug binding. In contrast, the RAF/MEK inhibitor resistance alleles were distributed throughout the ERK
proteins, although some mutations clustered in the aC-helix
and the common docking domain. The ERK aC-helix undergoes a conformational change when phosphorylated that is

necessary for kinase activation, whereas the common docking
domain represents one of the ERK substrate binding domains.
These observations suggested that ERK resistance alleles that
emerged under RAF/MEK inhibition might facilitate kinase
activation. In addition, several of these alterations have been
previously identiﬁed through DNA sequencing efforts. Alterations at ERK1R84, ERK1G186, ERK2D321, and ERK2E322 are listed
in the COSMIC database (24), and ERK2E322K is recurrently
mutated in cervical and head and neck cancers (25, 26);
however, none of these variants have been linked to drug
resistance.
ERK1 and ERK2 mutations confer resistance to ERK
inhibitors by interfering with drug binding
We ﬁrst characterized ERK1/2 mutations that arose in the
setting of ERK inhibition. To verify their resistance effects, we
engineered mutations into the DOX-inducible vector by site-

directed mutagenesis. The resulting constructs were stably
introduced into A375 cells and evaluated for growth in the
presence of VX-11e. In total, we tested 20 candidate DOXinducible ERK1/2 resistance alleles in cell growth inhibition
assays, of which 16 conferred >4-fold increased cell viability
compared with cells cultured without DOX (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Fig. S1G). In these experiments, wild-type ERK1 and ERK2 conferred a minor growth
advantage (1.5-fold) in the presence of the ERK inhibitor,
whereas kinase-dead ERK1 and ERK2 (27) and GFP had no
effect (Fig. 2A).
To determine whether these ERK1 and ERK2 resistance
alleles might confer cross-resistance to other ERK inhibitors,
we also performed cell growth inhibition assays using the ERK
inhibitor SCH772984. For ERK1, we chose four alleles that
conferred growth in the presence of the VX-11e, three of which
conferred maximal growth (>90%) and one that conferred
moderate resistance (>75%). We also included the three ERK2
alleles identiﬁed by the random mutagenesis screen. Indeed,
these alleles were also resistant to SCH772984, as measured by
>4-fold increases in viability following mutant allele expression. One allele, ERK1Y53H, showed only a 2.5-fold increase in
viability at 1 mmol/L SCH772984, but conferred a 5-fold growth
advantage at 0.5 mmol/L SCH772984, similar to the other ERK1
alleles (Fig. 2B). Conceivably, this difference may relate to
compound-speciﬁc differences in ERK binding associated with
this particular residue.
Next, we examined downstream ERK signaling from ten
validated alleles upon DOX induction. As a control, we included
wild-type ERK1 and ERK2, both of which produced robust RSK
phosphorylation and elevated DUSP6 expression in this setting
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, kinase-dead ERK1 and
ERK2 showed no increased RSK phosphorylation, but did
induce DUSP6 expression, suggesting a possible kinase-independent function (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the absence of
ERK inhibitor, all validated ERK resistance alleles examined
augmented RSK phosphorylation, DUSP6 expression, or both
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
Although the ERK inhibitor–resistant ERK alleles conferred
growth advantage in the presence of 11e, some alleles produced
discordant effects on ERK signaling. For example, both
ERK1G54A and the analogous variant ERK2G37S had minimal
effects on RSK phosphorylation following DOX induction, but
produced elevated DUSP6 expression (similar to the kinasedead ERK variants). In contrast, ERK1S74G, ERK1P75L, and the
orthologous allele ERK2P58L had modest effects on DUSP6
expression but robust upregulation of RSK phosphorylation.
Thus, although some ERK resistance alleles may only partially
augment downstream signaling, they may still confer a growth
advantage in the setting of ERK inhibition.
Next, we analyzed ERK signaling from these resistance
alleles upon addition of ERK inhibitors. All ten ERK inhibitor
resistance alleles enabled sustained ERK signaling based on
RSK phosphorylation, accumulation of DUSP6, or both (Fig.
2C). Cyclin D1, another downstream effector of ERK signaling,
was also maintained in the presence of drug compared with
controls. In addition, ERK signaling was maintained in the
presence of SCH772984 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). In contrast

7082

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

to VX-11e, which does not alter phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 2),
SCH772984 decreased phosphorylation of wild-type ERK1/2,
while having no effect on phosphorylation of the ERK2-resistant alleles (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Thus, these resistance
alleles can maintain ERK signaling in the presence of an ERK
inhibitor.
To determine whether the intrinsic kinase activity of the
ERK1/2 alleles was maintained with inhibition of ERK, we
examined the kinase activity of the ERK alleles via phosphorylation of an Elk-1 peptide using immunoprecipitation (IP)
kinase assays and immunoblotting (see Materials and Methods). As expected, VX-11e blocked wild-type ERK1- and ERK2mediated ELK-1 phosphorylation. In contrast, the ERK resistance alleles showed persistent ERK kinase activity in the
presence of either VX-11e (Fig. 3A and B) or SCH772984
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). As expected, kinase-dead ERK1/2
did not phosphorylate the ELK-1 peptide (Fig. 3A and B). Thus,
validated ERK resistance alleles maintained kinase activity
even with concomitant ERK inhibitor exposure.
Finally, we mapped the validated ERK1 and ERK2 alleles
within the three-dimensional crystal structure of ERK2 bound
to a structurally similar ERK inhibitor (VX-9a, PDB:3I60; ref. 23).
The resistance alleles lie in close proximity to the ATP/drug
binding pocket, albeit within distinct functional domains (Fig.
2D). In particular, they occupy the glycine-rich loop (ERK1I48N,
ERK1Y53H, ERK1G54A, ERK2Y36N/H, and ERK2G37S), an interval
between the b3-strand and aC-helix (ERK1S74G, ERK1P75L, and
ERK2P58L), the aC-helix itself (ERK1Y81C, ERK1C82Y, ERK2Y64N,
and ERK2C65Y), and the activation loop (ERK1G186D). Presumably, these substitutions interfere with engagement of the ATP
binding cleft by ERK inhibitors.
ERK mutations that confer resistance to RAF/MEK
inhibition preserve ERK activity despite MEK inhibition
Next, we validated a series of candidate ERK resistance
alleles that emerged from the RAF/MEK inhibitor mutagenesis
screens. After cloning and expressing these mutations as
described above, we performed cell growth inhibition assays
using the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the RAF inhibitor
dabrafenib, either alone or in combination. Of 17 mutated
alleles examined, 10 were conﬁrmed as resistant to each agent
and the combination, conferring >2.5-fold growth advantage
in the presence of the inhibitor(s) compared with controls
(Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S2). Of the 7 alleles that failed
validation, at least two may have been passenger mutations
that co-occurred with bona ﬁde resistance alleles during the
mutagenesis procedure (See Supplementary Materials and
Methods and Supplementary Fig. S4). Because we observed
robust growth advantage for two ERK1 alleles (ERK1A206V and
ERK1S219P), we engineered the analogous mutations within
ERK2 (because these were not observed in the primary screen).
The resulting alleles (ERK2A189V and ERK2S202P) also conferred
resistance to RAF/MEK inhibition (Fig. 4A).
The observation that validated ERK1/2 alleles conferred
cross-resistance to all RAF/MEK inhibitor conditions raised
the possibility that in contrast to the ERK inhibitor resistance
mutations (which may primarily interfere with inhibitor binding), these might represent activating events. This notion was

buttressed by the observation that the ERK2E322K mutation—a
known activating allele that occurs in cervical cancers (26)—
also arose in this context. Moreover, ERK1/2A206V/A189V and
ERK1/2S219P/S202P occur in the activation lip of ERK1/2 and
in close proximity to the two phosphorylation residues that
confer full ERK kinase activity when phosphorylated
(ERK1T202/Y204 and ERK2T185/Y187; Fig. 4B and Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Other validated RAF/MEK inhibitor resistance alleles
map to the aC-helix (ERK1C82Y, ERK1R84H, and ERK1Q90R) and
common docking domain (ERK1Y148H, ERK2Y131F, ERK2D321G,
and ERK2E322K). Also known as the D-site recruitment site, this
docking domain represents the means by which ERK1/2 binds
to some substrates. Mutations in the common docking
domains at ERK2D321N and ERK2E322K confer elevated activity
in vivo due to reduced DUSP binding (28, 29). Alterations at
ERK1/2Y148/Y131 have not been described, but may in principle
impair phosphatase and substrate binding considering their
three-dimensional localization near the common docking
domain (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Although our mutagenesis screens were unlikely to be
saturating, we only observed aC-helix resistance mutations
in ERK1, whereas common docking domain alterations
(ERK2D321G and ERK2E322K) were only found in ERK2 (Fig.
4B). Interestingly, the analogous common docking domain
mutations in ERK1 (ERK1D338N and ERK1E339K) did not confer
resistance to RAF/MEK inhibition in our hands (Supplementary Fig. S6). This suggests that although ERK1 and ERK2 are
highly homologous, "activating" variants of ERK1 and ERK2
may contain distinctive functional attributes, thus allowing
dissection of isoform-speciﬁc functions in the future.
Next, we analyzed ERK signaling after expression of the
validated alleles. As with the ERK inhibitor resistance mutations, DOX-induced expression of RAF/MEK inhibitor resistance alleles in both ERK1 and ERK2 activated ERK signaling,
as evidenced by RSK or DUSP6 expression (Supplementary Fig.

7084

S2). The common docking domain mutations (e.g., ERK2D321G
and ERK2E322K) did not induce RSK phosphorylation, consistent with published observations that such alterations may
disrupt RSK binding (30). When these same ERK mutations
were expressed in the presence of the MEK inhibitor, DUSP6
and cyclin D1 expression were maintained, whereas RSK
phosphorylation was more variable (Fig. 4C and D). Thus, ERK
mutations arising in the setting of RAF/MEK inhibition could
maintain ERK signaling, even in the presence of upstream
pathway inhibition.
To determine whether the intrinsic kinase activity of the
RAF/MEK inhibitor–resistant ERK alleles was maintained
despite MEK inhibitor exposure, we analyzed ERK kinase
activity by IP kinase assays. Here again, all ERK resistance
alleles examined maintained ERK kinase activity (as measured
by ELK-1 peptide phosphorylation) in the presence of MEK
inhibitor, even though MEK-dependent (and activating) ERK
phosphorylation was decreased (Fig. 5, input). ELK-1 binds to
both the F-site recruitment motif and the common docking
domain within ERK. Therefore, mutations conﬁned to the
common docking domain (ERK1Y148/ERK2Y131, ERK2D321G,
ERK2E322K) should not be sufﬁcient to abolish ERK-ELK-1
interactions (30, 31). However, we observed diminished residual kinase activity in the setting of trametinib exposure with
the common docking domain mutants compared with other
alleles (Fig. 5). Altogether, these results suggest that ERK
resistance alleles arising in the setting of RAF/MEK inhibition
maintain sufﬁcient kinase activity to rescue BRAF-mutant
melanoma cell growth—even in the presence of upstream
pathway inhibition.
RAF/MEK inhibitor–derived ERK resistance alleles are
sensitive to ERK inhibition and vice versa
Previous studies have shown that several clinically validated
genetic mechanisms of resistance to RAF and MEK inhibitors

remain sensitive to ERK inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S7A;
refs. 7, 8, 32). In our hands, RAF or MEK inhibitor–resistant
BRAF-mutant melanoma cell populations generated by continuous exposure to tool compound inhibitors (PLX-4720 and
AZD6244, respectively) following N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)
mutagenesis were also sensitive to ERK inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Because ERK resistance mutants arising
from ERK inhibitor screens were largely distinct from those
that emerged from the RAF/MEK inhibitor screens, we wished
to determine whether either category of ERK mutations might
confer cross-resistance to the alternative MAP kinase pathway
inhibitor(s).
To investigate this question, we performed cell growth
inhibition assays in the presence of RAF, MEK, or ERK
inhibitors. In general, ERK resistance mutations that arose
from RAF/MEK inhibitor screens were sensitive to ERK
inhibition. Conversely, the ERK mutations from ERK inhib-

itor screens remained sensitive to RAF and MEK inhibition
(or both; Fig. 6A). The same was true in two additional cell
lines (SKMEL-19 and WM266.4); however, the overall magnitude of resistance was lower in these lines (Fig. 6B and C
and Supplementary Fig. S8A). Interestingly, one ERK mutation (ERK1C82Y) conferred resistance to all MAP kinase
inhibitors tested—though the magnitude of the resistance
phenotype was more modest [45% (RAF/MEK inhibitors)
and 75% (ERK inhibitor) viability compared with untreated
controls]. Overall, ERK resistance mutations arising from
ERK inhibition remained vulnerable to combined RAF/MEK
inhibition, and the converse was also true.
ERK1/2 overexpression reduces the viability of some
BRAF-mutant melanoma cells
While performing these studies, we noticed that ERK overexpression was lethal to A375 cells in the absence of MAP

that these mutations enhance intrinsic or in vivo ERK kinase
activity. We observed similar viability defects in a second
BRAF-mutant melanoma cell line (WM266.4 cells; Supplementary Fig. S8). However, in a third cell line (SKMEL-19
cells), only the most active ERK1 resistance alleles (e.g.,
those with augmented kinase activity) reduced cell viability
(ERK1Q90R, ERK1Y148H, and ERK1S219P; Fig. 6B and C). These
data raise the possibility that excessive ERK signaling may
be detrimental to the growth of some BRAF-mutant melanoma cells, as observed by others (33, 34).

kinase pathway inhibition. Although this effect could certainly
result from nonspeciﬁc toxicities associated with ectopic
protein expression, it was also possible that "too much" MAP
kinase pathway activation might be deleterious to BRAFmutant melanoma cells—particularly in light of the "drug
holiday" effect that has occasionally been observed after RAF
inhibition in melanoma models (33). To test this possibility, we
assessed cell proliferation following ectopic expression of
validated ERK resistance mutations.
Overexpression of wild-type ERK1 and ERK2 indeed
decreased the viability of A375 cells (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, the growth-suppressive effect of
ERK overexpression was generally linked to kinase activity,
as kinase-dead ERK1/2 (ERK1K71R/ERK2K54R) had no effect.
Overexpression of ERK1G54A and ERK2G37S, which exhibit
reduced basal kinase activity compared with wild-type ERK
(Fig. 3), also had no effect on viability (Fig. 7A). In contrast,
ERK mutations arising in the setting of RAF/MEK inhibition
produced the greatest reductions in viability (Fig. 7B,

7086

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

In melanoma, clinical resistance to RAF/MEK inhibition
often involves reactivation of the MAPK pathway. Although
multiple distinct mechanisms to achieve this effect have been
described, ERK activation stands as their chief point of convergence. Thus, ERK represents an attractive therapeutic
target in MAP kinase–driven cancers, and several ERK inhibitors have entered clinical trials. However, even if ERK inhibitors are successful clinically, resistance to these agents will
likely emerge, as has been seen with most other kinase-based
anticancer therapeutics.
Secondary mutations within the kinase target represent a
common resistance mechanism for this class of therapeutics. The present study used random mutagenesis screens to
identify mutations in ERK1 and ERK2 that confer resistance
to tool compounds that bear structural similarity to ERK
inhibitors in clinical trials. Multiple resistance mutations
were identiﬁed in both ERK isoforms, and additional mutations could emerge in the future if such screens are carried
out to saturation. ERK mutations we identiﬁed using the VX11e compound were cross-resistant to SCH772984, suggesting that these resistance alleles might represent generalizable resistance mechanisms to ATP-competitive ERK
inhibitors.
In addition to identifying mutations in ERK that confer
resistance to ERK inhibitors, we identiﬁed several mutations
in both ERK1 and ERK2 that retain robust ERK signaling
despite pharmacologic RAF/MEK inhibition. Although we have
not formally proved that these represent bona ﬁde constitutive
active ERK isoforms, the mutations may nonetheless prove
useful for future biochemical studies.
One of the RAF/MEK inhibitor–resistant alleles detected in
our screen, MAPK1E322K (ERK2), was identiﬁed in cervical and
head and neck carcinoma (25, 26). Although ERK2E322K does
not exhibit increased basal kinase activity in vitro, our data are
consistent with the notion that this variant may remain
activated in vivo because of reduced DUSP binding and hence
loss of negative regulation (35), thereby conferring resistance
to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Conceivably, treatment of patients
containing this residue with RAF and/or MEK inhibitors may
prove ineffective.
Our results raise the possibility that tumors with somatic
ERK mutations arising in the setting of ERK inhibition might
still be sensitive to RAF/MEK inhibition. Reciprocally, ERK
mutations that confer resistance to RAF/MEK inhibition

could remain sensitive to ERK inhibitors. If such mutations
were to arise clinically, one could speculate that an alternative RAF/MEK and ERK dosing regimen might be
attempted to achieve more prolonged disease control.
Indeed, anecdotal reports of successful alternating targeted
therapeutic regimens have emerged for other oncogenedriven cancers, such as EGFR-driven lung cancer. Of course,
such speculation must be tempered by the fact that somatic
ERK mutations have not yet been described as a clinical
resistance mechanism to RAF/MEK inhibition in melanoma
or other cancers.
This work also implies that BRAF-mutant melanoma cells
must maintain tight control over ERK signaling to enable
optimal growth. On the one hand, if ﬂux through the MAPK
pathway diminishes too much, growth arrest or apoptosis
ensues. On the other hand, our results suggest that excessive

MAPK signaling (over and above that conferred by BRAFV600E)
can also reduce cell viability, at least in some cases. This result
is concordant with recent observations that "acute" withdrawal
of vemurafenib from a patient-derived xenograft tumor model
that had progressed to drug resistance produced a temporary
tumor regression (34). This has also been termed the "drug
holiday" effect (33). Presumably, the ﬂare of MAP kinase
signaling that ensues upon drug discontinuation is deleterious
to melanoma cells (of note, BRAF ampliﬁcation was a resistance mechanism in this study, making an acute signaling ﬂare
even more likely upon drug removal).
If this general phenomenon (e.g., lethality of acute drug
withdrawal) were broadly relevant at some point during the
treatment course, one could envision intermittent therapeutic
strategies for RAF/MEK inhibition in melanoma. Indeed, discontinuous vemurafenib allowed for disease stabilization in

the aforementioned study by Das Thakur, Stuart and colleagues (34). There have also been reports of successful rechallenge with vemurafenib in patients that initially relapsed on
the drug (36–38). Moreover, recent clinical trial results, in
which vemurafenib was administered chronically, while the
MEK inhibitor was given intermittently, suggest that intermittent MEK inhibition was no worse than chronic administration of both drugs, but MEK inhibitor toxicity may have
been reduced by intermittent dosing (39). The ERK resistance alleles identiﬁed herein may provide a useful set of
tools for detailed preclinical evaluation of intermittent ERK
inhibition alternating with "acute" ERK hyperactivation as a
novel therapeutic approach.
In summary, this study has identiﬁed a set of mutations in
ERK1 and ERK2 that confer resistance to MAP kinase pathway
inhibition at the level of RAF/MEK and ERK. These ﬁndings
may anticipate future resistance mechanisms, enable new
biochemical studies of ERK isoforms, and support preclinical
studies of novel therapeutic strategies. They could also inform
the development of "next-generation" ERK inhibitors that
could be developed for melanoma and many other MAP
kinase–driven cancers.
