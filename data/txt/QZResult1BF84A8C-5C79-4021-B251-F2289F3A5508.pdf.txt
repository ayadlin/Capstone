ABSTRACT
Claudins are essential for the formation and maintenance of tight junctions (TJ). The
altered expression of claudin proteins has been described in a variety of malignancies.
However, the alteration of these proteins in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) are poorly
understood. Therefore, we report, based on the protein expression analysis of a total of
275 patient samples, that claudin-3 (CLDN3) expression is significantly increased in ADC
tissues and is associated with cancer progression, correlating significantly with the poor
survival of ADC patients (p=0.041&0.029). More importantly, forcing CLDN3 expression
in ADC cells without endogenous CLDN3 expression resulted in significant increases in
the cell proliferation, anchorage-dependent growth, migration and drug-resistance. In
addition, epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling pathway modulates the expression
of claudins in a number of solid tumors. However, the mechanism of tight junction
regulation by EGF in ADC remains unclear. To investigate this mechanisms, ADC cell lines
were treated with EGF and its inhibitor. EGF unregulated CLDN3 expression via the MEK/
ERK or PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and was required for the maintenance of baseline
CLDN3 expression. Furthermore, downregulation of CLDN3 expression in ADC cell was
found to prevent the EGF-induced increase in cell proliferation. In conclusion, our results
demonstrate a novel role of CLDN3 overexpression in promoting the malignant potential
of lung adenocarcinoma. This function is potentially regulated by the EGF-activated
MEK/ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways.

Claudins are a family of the major integral
membrane proteins forming the backbone of tight
junctions, which has been identified by the date of
varying cell and tissue-specific expression level [4, 5].
The alteration of claudin expression has been reported
in tumors isolated from colon [6], breast [7, 8], ovary
[9], pancreas [10], prostate [11], stomach [12] and lung
tissues [13]. The certain member of this family affects the
development as well as the invasion and aggressive growth
of cancer cells. In lung adenocarcinoma patients, the
downregulation of CLDN1 was predicted a poor survival
[14]. Furthermore, the excessive expression of CLDN1

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer remains the major cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide [1]. Lung adenocarcinoma
is the most common histological subtype which is
increasing in prevalence [2]. Appearance of EGFR
tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors (TKI)had brought
a revolutionary change in non-small cell lung
cancer(NSCLC), such as gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib
and AZD9291, especially those with adenocarcinomas
[3]. EGF-driven cell signaling contributes to unregulated
progression and cancer malignancy.

attenuated the invasive and migrate properties of cultured
ADC cells lacking endogenous CLDN1 expression. In
lung cancer tissue microarrays, CLDN7 expression has
been found to be either down-regulated or disrupted in
its distribution pattern in cancerous tissue compared
to normal tissue [15]. The overexpression of CLDN7
inhibits cell migration and invasion in NCI-H1299 lacking
endogenous CLDN7 expression. CLDN2 expression in
lung adenocarcinoma tissue is higher than that in normal
tissue and other lung carcinomas. Ikari recently reported
that CLDN2 enhances cell colonization and migration in
lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, and CLDN2 may be
involved in the regulation of cancer cell motility [16, 17].
More importantly, CLDN3 is involved in the development
of acinus and the differentiation of alveolar epithelial
cells [18] and its levels varied in different subtypes of
lung carcinomas [13, 19]. Furthermore, compared to
lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), an increased
expression of CLDN3 was found in ADC [19–21]. There
might be an association between the overexpression of
CLDN3 and the carcinogenesis of ADC. CLDN3 and
CLDN4 are highly overexpression in all subtypes of
epithelial ovarian cancers, and these regulation enhances
angiogenic effects and invasive properties as well as
increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity [6]. In
addition, CLDN3 is one of the natural receptor for the
a cytolytic toxin, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin
(CPE), binding to its receptor to induce cell apoptosis [22].
However, the underlying mechanisms that regulate the
function and expression of CLDN3, particularly in lung
adenocarcinoma, are poorly understood.
The expression and localization of claudin protein
affect cell function, and EGF signaling pathway plays
a pivotal role in the regulation of claudin protein. For
instance, EGF was mediated the upregulation of CLDN1,
3 and 4, and downregulation of CLDN2, which increased
the force of intercellular barrier in MDCK-II cells [23,
24]. In addition, EGF may also regulate the expression
functions of claudins in ovarian and colon cancer cells
during cancer development via the EGF-activated ERK1/2
and PI3K-Akt pathways [25, 26]. However, its regulatory
mechanism in ADC remains unclear. Therefore, it is
important to understand the expression and function of
CLDN3 as well as molecular mechanisms regulating the
expression of CLDN3 in ADC.

higher in the adenocarcinoma specimens compared
with normal tissues (Figure 1A & 1B, **p<0.01). We
next performed immunohistochemical analysis in 261
ADC patients using an anti-CLDN3 antibody. The
intensity of CLDN3 staining was independently scored
by two pathologists, and low and high classification was
distinguished (see methods). CLDN3 expression was
lower in most of the normal lung tissue, but highter in the
ADC tissues (overexpression rate 10% vs. 55%, p<0.01).
Furthermore, The CLDN3 protein level was significantly
correlated with the CLDN4, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and
vimentin expression levels (p=0.006, p=0.023, p=0.021,
and p=0.017, respectively), except EGFR.
The correlation between the CLDN3 expression
status and the clinicopathologic features of 261 ADCs
was further evaluated, and the findings are summarized
in Table 1. A positive correlation was observed between
the CLDN3 upregulation and recurrence and/or metastasis
(Table 1). Furthermore, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
demonstrated that the 5-year survival rate was significantly
lower in patients with CLDN3 upregulation (n=144) than
in the patients with lower CLDN3 expression (n=117,
median DFS was 28-month vs. 52-month and median
OS was 36-month vs. 55-month) (pDFS=0.029; pOS=0.041,
Figure 1D). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that
the upregulation of CLDN3 (pDFS=0.020, pOS=0.018) was
an independent prognostic predictors for ADC patients
(Table 2).
Similarly, CLDN3 was also significantly upregulated
in 7/9 (78%) of the ADC cell lines (A549, PC9, CaLu3, NCI-H1299, LTEP-a 2, PG49, NCI-H358, NCI-H1650
and NCI-H1975, Figure 1E). Taken together, our data
demonstrates significant CLDN3 overexpression in
ADC tissues and predicts a potential correlation between
CLDN3 expression and cancer progression.

Alterations in CLDN3 expression affect the
proliferation, clonality, migration and protect
against the effects of cisplatin
As shown in Figure 2, in the CLDN3
downregulation condition (Figure 2A), we observed
decreases in proliferation both in the A549 (Cld3KD)
and PC9 (Cld3KD) cells (Figure 2C, & 2D; *p<0.05,
**p<0.01). Conversely, in the CLDN3 overexpression
condition(Figure 2A & 2B), we observed increased
proliferation in H358Cld3 compared to their respective
controls (Figure 2C & 2D; *p<0.05). It is well known that
cell transformation plays an important role in evaluation of
malignant potential [27]. In this context, we evaluated the
cell-transforming potential of CLDN3 in A549, PC9, and
NCI-H358 cells. As observed in Figure 2E, the CLDN3
upregulation group displayed more numbers of anchoragedependent colonies compared with control group, while
the downregulation of CLDN3 led to the reverse trend
(Figure 2D & 2E, **p<0.01; *p<0.01). Furthermore, the

adenocarcinoma, and CLDN3 overexpression significantly
increased the tumorigenicity and development of both cell
types under study.
Furthermore, we detected the effects of cisplatin, a
traditional lung cancer treatment drug, on the H1975Cld3,
H358Cld3 and control cells. Cells were exposed to a given
concentration of cisplatin (4μg/ml), and cell viability was
examined by EDU assay after 24 hours. As expected,
cisplatin decreased the cell viability, and the H1975Cld3
and H358Cld3 cells were significantly insensitive from the
cisplatin compared to the control groups (Figure  4A &
4B, **p<0.01). In addition, we determined that cisplatin
treatment inhibited proliferation while increasing
apoptosis (Figure 4C, **p<0.01) in both of the control
group cells, and increased caspase3 degradation in control
group cells compared with H358Cld3 cells.

CLDN4 was not changed in this same manner (Figure
5D–5G, **p<0.01). These results demonstrated that EGF
activation differentially regulates the claudin members
depending on the cellular context.

EGF-activated MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT
signaling pathways mediate the increase in
CLDN3 expression
EGFR-activated downstream signaling pathways,
ERK1/2 kinase, p38 MAP kinase and/or PI-3 kinase, play
key roles in the regulation of EGFR-dependent cellular
functions. We further made use of pathway-specific
inhibitors, for which cells were pretreated with either
SB239063 (p38 MAP kinase inhibitor), U0126 (MRK
kinase inhibitor), or LY294002 (PI -3 kinase inhibitor).
The SB239063 had no effect on either EGF-induced or
the baseline CLDN3 expression, while the LY294002
partially inhibited the EGFR- induced increase in the
CLDN3 expression (##p<0.01, EGF+LY294002 vs. EGFtreated). Notably, the U0126 inhibited the EGF-dependent
upregulation and basic line expression of CLDN3, which is
similar to EGFR inhibitor (Figure 5H; **p<0.01, compared
with control, ##p<0.01, EGF+PD153035 or EGF+U0126
vs. EGF treated, and *p<0.05 EGF+PD153035 or EGF
+U0126 vs. control). Taken together, our data indicated
the critical role of the EGFR and its downstream ERK1/2
kinase in the regulation of CLDN3 expression.

EGF mediated increasing the protein levels of
CLDN3 in NCI-H358 and NCI-H1975 Cells
Initially, we examined that EGF treatment
significantly induced the alteration of the protein levels
of EGFR downstream p-Akt and p-ERK1/2 in a timedependent manner (Figure 5A). In addition, EGF
treatment also mediated an increast expression of CLDN3,
which was inhibited by EGF inhibitor, PD153035. More
importantly, PD153035 treatment alone inhibited the
basal level of CLDN3 in ADC cells that did not receive
EGF treatment, suggesting that EGFR signaling pathway
activation is potential required for the maintenance of
CLDN3 expression (Figure 5B &5C, compared with
control cells, **p<0.01; compared with EGF-treated
cells, ##p<0.01). Furthermore, EGF-activated increase
in CLDN3 expression was dose-dependent both in the
NCI-H358 and NCI-H1975 cells, while the levels of

DISCUSSION

the 10 mice injected with the A549 (Cld3KD) cells and
the control groups, respectively (Figure 7A). Moreover,
the size of the tumors caused by the A549 (Cld3KD) cells
was significantly smaller than those tumors induced by
the A549 Con cells (** p<0.01, Figure 7B). Furthermore,
the downregulation of CLDN3 also had an impact on the
expression of E-cadherin and vimentin in vivo (Figure 7C),
and A549 (Cld3KD) cells showed a lower proliferation
rate compared with the control groups (Figure 7D, p
<0.01), consistent with the in vitro findings. These results
demonstrated that CLDN3 closely associated with tumor
proliferative capacity in vivo, and probably played a
pivotal role in EMT process.

CLDN3 belongs to a family of proteins important
in TJ formation and function. Like the tumors in other
organs, lung tumors also demonstrate variation in the
expression in TJ proteins [28]. For instance, CLDN5
expression was detected in most of adenocarcinomas,
but squamous cell carcinomas was detected CLDN1
overexpression [13, 29]. However, its expression pattern
and biological function remain largely unknown in the
context of human lung adenocarcinoma. Here, we showed
that CLDN3 was frequently upregulated in human ADC,
and its upregulation was significantly associated with

poor DFS and OS in ADC patients. We also observed that
the forced expression of CLDN3 increased the malignant
potential in ADC. Furthermore, We demonstrated that
EGF induced the overexpression of CLDN3 protein, an
event mediated by the EGFR downstream MEK/ERK and
PI3K/Akt pathways. Moreover, the genetic silencing of
CLDN3 also reduce the tumor burden in vivo.
Similar as CLDN3 overexpression in colonic [30]
and ovarian [22] cancers, CLDN3 expression is increased in
most of lung adenocarcinoma. Overexpression of CLDN3
predicts poor prognosis of ovarian serous adenocarcinoma
[31]. Consist with ovarian adenocarcinoma, this study also
show that the overexpression of CLDN3 is significantly
correlated with recurrence, metastasis and survival. We
also found that CLDN3 expression in ADC tissue and cells
was significantly correlated with E-cadherin, N-cadherin
and vimentin expression, and it thus may be involved in
the development of ADC. Such changes in EMT marker
have been observed in various cancers and experimentally
linked to increased cell motility, invasion and metastasis
[32]. Furthermore, CLDN3 knockdown decreased the
cell migration and proliferation of A549 and PC9 cells,
whereas CLDN3 overexpression increased H358 cell

proliferation, colonization, migration and chemotherapy
resistance. The silencing CLDN3 expression in the ADC
cells also decreased tumor growth in vivo. Similarly,
the upregulation of CLDN3 in ovarian epithelial cancer
enhances matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity and is
associated with tumor invasion and angiogenic effects
[6]. In contrast, the ectopic expression of CLDN3 in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells could inhibit tumorigenesis
and cancerous cells migration and invasion [33]. A
recent study revealed that downregulation of CLDN3 in
SqCC patients is an independent prognostic factor for
DFS, and correlated with an decreased expression of
E-cadherin and β-catenin and an upregulation of vimentin
[34]. However, compared to SqCC and normal tissue,
an increased expression of CLDN3 was found in ADC
[19–21]. In addition, CLDN3 expression was also having
versatility in breast carcinoma [35–37]. Resolving this
discrepancy in different types of tumor cells will require
a better understanding of the specific function of different
claudin member [29]. These reports suggest that CLDN3
expression may be involved in organ/tissue specifiity, and
the increased expression of CLDN3 participates in lung
adenocarcinoma tumorigenicity [13].

EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways
involving MEK/ERK, p38 MAPK, and PI3K/Akt play
key roles in the proliferation and differentiation of
normal epithelial cells and has been associated with the
development of tumor, especially lung cancer [3, 38].
EGFR signaling pathway also modulates fence and barrier
production. However, EGF mediated the alternation
of claudin protein expression are a great difference and
depend on the different cell type and tumor as previous
described. For instance, a recent study showed that
EGF induced downregulation of CLDN3 in mucinous
cystadenocarcinoma via the MEK/ERK or PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway by inducing degradation of the TJ
proteins with changes in structures and functions [25].
Conversely, upregulation of CLDN3 play fundamental role
to promote the development of colorectal cancer, which
is potentially regulated by the EGF-activated downstream
pathway, ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways [30].
More importantly, the EGF-induced overexpression of
CLDN3 in ADC cells was paralleled by speeding cell
proliferation. Furthermore, the cells were pretreated with

EGFR and its downstream signaling inhibitors before EGF
activation. Interestingly, pretreatment with the inhibitors
of EGFR, PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK decreased the level of
CLDN3 induced by EGF-activation, but not p38 MAPK.
The EGF-induced increase in CLDN3 was eliminated
completely upon inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling and
partially upon inhibition of PI-3 kinase. Activation of EGF
signaling pathway not only induced CLDN3 expression
but also appeared necessary to maintain the baseline
CLDN3 expression. More importantly, downregulation
of CLDN3 abolished this EGF-induced increase in
proliferation. These findings demonstrated that EGF
mediated the alteration of claudins in ADC cells via
the MEK/ERK or PI3K/Akt pathways as modulators of
CLDN3 upregulation-related tumor progression in ADC.
CLDN3 is one of the natural receptor for the
Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, a potent cytolytic
toxin. Therefore, CPE-based treatment for malignancies
increased CLDN3 expression, such as ovarian tumor,
chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer and other
aggressive solid tumors may be effective [22, 39, 40].

vimentin and N-cadherin expression D. Compared with the control group, the Cld3KD group demonstrated upregulation of E-cadherin and
a lower proliferation rate (Ki-67 and PCNA index).

Immunohistochemical analysis

As one of the most successful treatment in ovarian
cancer, CLDN3 is overexpressed in a majority of ovarian
cancer but not detected in normal tissues. Furthermore,
other target treatments for CLDN3, siRNA therapy or
recombinant shRNA plasmid and cisplatin, have been
shown to inhibit ovarian cancer progression and reduce
the amount of cytotoxic drugs [41–44]. Thus, our study
indicates CLDN3 may be as a molecular target for future
application in the ADC treatment.
Overall, we have indicated a consistent and
significant increase in CLDN3 expression in lung
adenocarcinoma and a causal association between
CLDN3 overexpression and prognosis of ADC patients.
Additionally, we have provided new function of CLDN3
in the regulation of ADC proliferation and invasion.
Importantly, we demonstrated EGF and its downstream
signaling pathway MEK/ERK or PI3K/Akt mediated the
upregulation of CLDN3 expression and maintain the basic
level of claudins. Furthermore, we showed that CLDN3
silencing can decrease the malignant potential and prevent
the EGF-induced proliferation. Most importantly, our
study contributes to a better understanding of the new
function of CLDN3 and the molecular mechanisms that
regulate the CLDN3 expression. Lastly, our study indicates
that CLDN3 became a potential molecular target for future
application in the treatment of ADC.

Tumors were removed, weighed, fixed in 5%
formalin, and prepared for histological analysis.
Immunohistochemical staining was carried out using
the ABC staining kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; CA,
USA) and a secondary biotinylated antibody to rabbit
IgG (Invitrogen). CLDN3, CLDN4, EGFR, E-cadherin,
Vimentin, and N-cadherin immunoreactivity were
assessed based on a combined score of the extent and
intensity of staining. Scores 0–3 were assigned according
to the percentage of positive tumor cells (0=0%; 1=<33%;
3=33–66%; 3=>66%) and the intensity of tumor staining
(0=0; 1=1+; 3=2+; 3=3+). The two scores were multiplied
to give an overall score of 0–9, for which 0 was considered
negative, 1–2 was considered weak, 3–6 was considered
moderate, and 9 was considered strong staining. Negative
and weak expression was considered to be low, whereas
moderate and strong expression was considered to be high.
Any discordant scores were reviewed together by both
scorers to obtain a consensus score.

Lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA
transduction
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral transduction
particles for the CLDN3 knockdown experiments were
obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO). Two of three
CLDN3-specific shRNA constructs (shRNA sequence
targeting CLDN3: CCGGCGACCGCAAGGACTACGT
CTACTCGAGTAGACGTAGTCCTTGCGGTCGTTTT
TG;CCGGGACTACGTCTAAGGGACAGACCTCGA
GGTCTGTCCCTTAGACGTAGTCTTTTTTG) and one
“nontarget” construct were transduced separately into
293T cells. The “nontarget” construct contained a shRNA
sequence that did not target any known human gene and
served as a scrambled negative control. Briefly, 293T cells
were transduced with the CLDN3 specific shRNA lentiviral
particles for 24 hours in the presence of hexadimethrine
bromide to improve the transduction efficiency. Afterward,
the medium containing viral particles was removed
and replaced with fresh medium containing 10 μg/ml
puromycin. Before lentiviral transduction, a puromycin
titration was performed that identified 10 μg/ml as the
minimum puromycin concentration to cause the complete
death of the 293T cells after a 5-day incubation. CLDN3
knockdown was confirmed using a Western blot analysis
based comparison to the nontarget shRNA cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and clinical specimens
Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, including
NCI-H1650, NCI-H1299, LTEP-a 2, NCI-H1975, CaLu3, A549, PG49, NCI-H358, NCI-H1299 and HEY-293T,
were obtained from ATCC. The cell lines were maintained
in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) -1640
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen,
USA).
The lung carcinoma tissues and clinical data
obtained from our institute were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of China (approval ID
81470137). We also subjected the cell lysates from the
clinical specimens to Western blot analysis.

Western blot
The total protein was extracted, and the
concentrations were determined using the Bradford Protein
Assay (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA). 50 μg of protein from
each sample was separated on 8–12% SDS PAGE and
transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio
Rad). Blots were detected by incubation with antibodies to
CLDN3, CLDN4 (Abcam), EGFR, E-cadherin, Vimentin,
N-cadherin, caspase-3, Akt, p-Akt, ERK1/2, p- ERK1/2
and GAPDH (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA).

wild-type cells with pCDH-Cld3 or empty vectors and
selecting successfully transduced cells with 7.5 mg/mL
puromycin for at least 5 days. The clones were isolated,
and the overexpression of CLDN3 and 4 was confirmed
by immunoblotting.

A 24-well Boyden chamber with an 8 μm pore size
polycarbonate membrane (Corning, NY) was used to
evaluate cell motility. 105 cells were seeded in the upper
chamber with 200 μl serum free medium. 600 μl medium
with 10% serum was added into the lower chamber as a
chemoattractant. 16 h after incubation, the membranes was
fixed with methanol and stained with a three-step staining
set (Thermo, UK). Five visual fields were randomly
selected from each membrane. All experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Fluorescence confocal microscopy
NCI-H1975 and NCI-H358 cells were transfected
with a control or pCDH-Cld3 for 72 h. Cells were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde and subjected to indirect
immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-CLDN3.
Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Olympus;
Tokyo, Japan) was performed using an Olympus confocal
microscope according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
magnification used was 40×.

Treatment with EGF and pharmacological
inhibitors
Cell cultures were treated with 100 ng/mL EGF, a
concentration consistent with that used in other studies
[26]. The effects of EGF treatment on the CLDN3 and
CLDN4 expression in A549 and H358 cells were assessed
in cells growing in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS after 48 h. For pharmacological inhibition,
cells were serum starved overnight, and selective inhibitors
were added to the cell cultures 1 h before EGF treatment
to inhibit the intrinsic kinase activity. The cells were
then incubated with fresh culture medium supplemented
with 10% FBS containing EGF and selective inhibitors,
which were maintained throughout the experiments. The
inhibitors were diluted in DMSO and stored at -20°C.
Each concentrated solution was diluted immediately
before each experiment to yield final concentrations of
0.5 μM (PD153035; EGFR inhibitor), 10 μM (U0126;
ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor), 20 μM (LY294002; PI -3 kinase
inhibitor) or 5 μM (SB239063; p38 kinase inhibitor) [26].

Cell proliferation assay
After cells were seeded in 24-well plate, EdU was
added to the culture medium at a concentration of 50 μM/
ml for 8 h to chase the DNA template according to the
instructions in the Cell Light EdU DNA cell kit (Apollo
488/567, RiboBio, China). Briefly, after being fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde and treated with 0.5% Triton X
for 15 min, cells were incubated in darkness with Apollo,
and their nuclei were stained by Hoechst 33342. EdUlabeled cells were counted manually in five fields of view
randomly selected from each well, and the percentages
were calculated.

Anchorage-dependent colony formation
For the anchorage-dependent colony formation
assays, A549(Cld3KD), PC9 (Cld3KD), NCI-H358Cld3
and the relevant controls were seeded in a six-well plate
at a low density (5×102) for 7 days. After 7 days, the
cells were fixed with ethanol for 6 min and stained with
a crystal violet solution (0.05% crystal violet and 20%
methanol). The cells were then washed twice with water
and solubilized with methanol. All experiments were
performed in triplicate.

In vivo tumorigenicity
1x107 stable A549 (Cld3KD) cells and control
cells were injected subcutaneously into the left groin of
6-week-old male BALB/c nude mice (n=7 per group).
The tumor diameter was measured every 3 days from
the 28th day after inoculation for 25 days. The tumor
volume was calculated by the formula V=0.5×L×W2.
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal
Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Tianjin medical
university cancer hospital and institute.

Wound scratch assay
Each group of A549 (Cld3KD), PC9 (Cld3KD),
NCI-H358Cld3 and the relevant controls were seeded into a
six-well plate. On the following day, when the cells were
approximately 90% or more confluent, each well was
scraped with a 20 μl pipette tip to create 3 linear regions
devoid of cells. Then, the cells in each well were cultured
with RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) containing
2% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) in a humidified
incubator. Photographs of the wounded area were taken
immediately after making the scratch (0 hour time point)
and after 24 hours to monitor the invasion of cells into the
wounded area.

Statistical analysis
Associations between the CLDN3 expression and
clinical and biological characteristics were analyzed by
x2 or Fisher’s exact test. Survival curves were drawn
using the Kaplan–Meier method. The Cox proportional
hazards regression (forward likelihood ratio model) was
used for multivariate survival analyses. All two-group
comparisons utilized Student’s t-test with the assumption
of unequal variance. Data are presented as the mean ±
