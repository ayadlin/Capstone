ABSTRACT
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer.
Despite response to chemotherapy, relapses are frequent and resistance to available
treatments is often observed in the metastatic setting. Therefore, identification of
new therapeutic strategies is required. Here we have investigated the effect of the
mithramycin analog EC-8042 (demycarosil-3D-β-D-digitoxosyl mithramycin SK) on
TNBC. The drug caused a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of a set of TNBC
cell lines in vitro, and decreased tumor growth in mice xenografted with TNBC cells.
Mechanistically, EC-8042 caused an arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, coincident
with an increase in pCDK1 and Wee1 levels in cells treated with the drug. In addition,
prolonged treatment with the drug also causes apoptosis, mainly through caspaseindependent routes. Importantly, EC-8042 synergized with drugs commonly used in
the therapy of TNBC in vitro, and potentiated the antitumoral effect of docetaxel in
vivo. Together, these data suggest that the mithralog EC-8042 exerts an antitumoral
action on TNBC cells and reinforces the action of standard of care drugs used in the
therapy of this disease. These characteristics, together with a better toxicology profile
of EC-8042 with respect to mithramycin, open the possibility of its clinical evaluation.

INTRODUCTION

mithramycin as an agent able to sensitize TNBC cells to
the antitumoral effect of taxanes [7]. Mithramycin is a
reversible DNA binding antitumoral antibiotic approved
since 1970 by the FDA, although severe side effects
have limited its use in the clinic. Recently, promising
in vitro and in vivo activity linked to specific modes
of action [8, 9] have triggered its clinical evaluation in
Ewing sarcoma, lung, esophagus and other thoracic
malignancies [10]. The mode of action of mithramycin
and several of its analogs involves a non-covalent
interaction with GC-rich DNA regions located at the
minor groove of DNA [11-13]. Several studies have
pointed out that the basis for the antitumor properties
of mithramycin and other analogs tested to date is the
inhibition of replication and transcription processes
during macromolecular biosynthesis by interacting with
GC-rich nucleotide sequences, especially the site of union
of Sp1 transcription factor [14-17]. As a consequence,

Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs)
comprise 15% of all breast tumors, and are defined at
immunohistochemical level as tumors lacking detectable
expression of hormone receptors, and no HER2 gene
amplification [1-3]. Treatment of TNBC is based on
chemotherapy, effective in these tumors because of their
rapid proliferation rates and frequent derangements in
DNA repair mechanisms [4]. Unfortunately, relapses are
frequent, and resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents is
often encountered in the metastatic setting [4-6]. These
facts, together with the relatively poor knowledge of
the driver molecular alterations present in TNBC have
stimulated research to identify aberrant signaling networks
that may be pharmacologically attacked [4].

that enhance paclitaxel activity in TNBC identified

proteins whose expression is affected by this drug
include various protooncogenes, proteins involved in
angiogenesis or antiapoptotic processes, p53-mediated
transcriptional responses, as well as multidrug resistant
gene 1 (MDR-1) [18]. All these facts have fostered interest
in the development of mithramycin analogs (mithralogs)
with improved properties, focusing on those with lower
toxicity, thus having better clinical chances than the
wild type natural product [19]. Demycarosyl-3D-β-Ddigitoxosyl-mithramycin SK (EC-8042) is a mithramycin
analog generated by combinatorial biosynthesis currently
under development as antitumor agent. EC-8042 is a
lead molecule in the quest for mithralogs with improved
therapeutic window, since it is 10 times less toxic than
mithramycin in vivo, while it is active both in vitro and
in cancer xenograft models [20]. Moreover, recent gene
expression array data have confirmed not only the role of
Sp1 inhibition in the mechanism of action of EC-8042,
but also other signaling networks relevant in cancer [21].
These precedents led us to explore the potential
antitumoral action of EC-8042 against TNBC. Here we
show that EC-8042 is active against a panel of TNBC
cell lines and exerts antitumoral properties in TNBC cells
xenografted in mice. Moreover, the drug augmented the
action of compounds used clinically in the treatment of
TNBC. Studies on the mechanism of action demonstrated
that the drug exerted its action by a complex mechanism
that involved cell cycle and proapoptotic effects. Together,
the data suggest that EC-8042 could be considered for
further development with the aim of being incorporated
to the armamentarium used in the therapy of the disease.

in non-TNBC breast cancer cell lines than in the case
of the TNBC cell lines, indicating that EC-8042 could
be better suited to be used in TNBC than in other breast
cancer subtypes.

EC-8042 provokes cell cycle arrest in G2
The decrease in MTT metabolization caused by EC8042 could be caused by reduction in cell proliferation,
increased cell death or a combination of both. To further
analyze the antiproliferative mechanism of action of
EC-8042 DNA stainings of MDA-MB231, HS578T and
HBL100 cells were performed. Addition of EC-8042 to
these cells increased the magnitude of the peak of the
histogram corresponding to cells in the G2 or M phases
(Figure 2A and 2B). A concomitant decrease of cells in
the peak corresponding to the G1 phase was observed.
In HBL100 cells, treatment with the drug also caused an
increase in cells accumulating in G2/M at 100 nM. At 500
nM, the drug provoked accumulation of cells in the subG1
region of the histogram, suggestive of induction of cell
death. This subG1 accumulation of cells treated at 500
nM of the compound was also observed in MDA-MB231,
although to a much lesser extent.
The biochemical effects of EC-8042 on cell cycle
regulatory proteins were evaluated in continuously
growing cultures of MDA-MB231 and HBL100 cells.
Western blotting analyses showed that treatment with
EC-8042 caused a substantial decrease in the phosphatase
cdc25C, together with an increase in Cyclin D3, Cyclin
E, Cyclin A, Cyclin B, CDK2, and the phosphorylation
of CDK1 at tyrosine 15. In MDA-MB231 cells the drug
also increased the levels of p27 and Wee1 (Figure 2C).
The above results confirmed that EC-8042 had an effect on
proteins involved in the control of cell cycle progression.
To more accurately define the cell cycle effects of
EC-8042 we performed cell synchronization experiments,
followed by release of the cells in the absence or presence
of EC-8042, and analyses of the cell cycle profiles as well
as markers of cell cycle progression at different times
after release. In MDA-MB231 cells, double thymidine
treatment caused accumulation of cells in G1 (Figure
3A). At three and six hours after release the cells moved
through S phase either in the absence or presence of
EC-8042. At twelve hours after release, while most of
the control cells have progressed through mitosis and
accumulated at G1, cells chased in the presence of EC8042 accumulated in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.
Biochemical analyses of Cyclins D1-D3 involved in G1
S cell cycle progression indicated that EC-8042 did
not substantially decrease their levels for up to 12 hours
(Figure 3B). At 24 hours of treatment, a decrease in Cyclin
D1 was observed in cells treated with EC-8042.
Sequential activation of CDK2 by Cyclin A and
then CDK1 by Cyclins A and B are required to maintain
Rb hyperphosphorylated to ensure cell cycle progression.

RESULTS
Effect of EC-8042 on TNBC cell lines
The structure of demycarosyl-3D-β-D-digitoxosylmithramycin SK (EC-8042) is shown in Figure 1A. To
analyze the potential antineoplastic effect of the drug
on TNBC, we evaluated its action on a panel of eight
representative TNBC cell lines using MTT metabolization
as readout of the effect of the drug on cell number. In
addition, we also explored the action of EC-8042 on six
additional breast cancer cell lines which belong to other
subtypes of breast cancer (two hormone receptor positive,
and four HER2+). Cells were plated and treated for 48
(Figure S1) or 72 hours (Figure 1B) with different doses
of EC-8042. Treatment with EC-8042 decreased MTT
metabolization of all the cell lines studied in a dosedependent manner. At 72 hours of treatment, the drug
IC50 values for all the TNBC cell lines were below 100
nM (Figure 1C), indicating that EC-8042 was a potent
inhibitor of the MTT metabolization in these cells. The
IC50 values observed for EC-8042 were in general higher

Then, when cells enter mitosis, the amounts of both
cyclins rapidly decrease [22]. Treatment with EC-8042
slightly delayed phosphorylation of Rb (Figure 3B).
In control cells, levels of Cyclin A and Cyclin B rose,
reaching a peak at 6 hours after release from the G1
blockade. At 12 hours after chase, the amounts of Cyclin
A and B decreased with respect to the levels present in
cells at 6 hours. In EC-8042-treated cells the levels of both
cyclins progressively increased and remained elevated for
up to 24 hours of treatment (Figure 3B).
Dephosphorylation of CDK1 at Y15, required for
entry in mitosis, is controlled by the balance between the
activity of the Wee1 kinase and the Cdc25c phosphatase.
In control cells, pCDK1-Y15 levels decreased at 12 hours.
In contrast, in cells treated with EC-8042 the levels of
pCDK1-Y15 were sustained along the duration of the
experiment (Figure 3B). Analyses of the phosphorylation
of histone H3, which is used as a marker of cells in
mitosis, indicated that cells treated with EC-8042 did not
efficiently progressed into mitosis. Similar results were
observed in HBL100 cells (Figure 3C and 3D).

With the purpose of evaluating whether a
relationship existed among the levels of the proteins
analyzed above and involved in the regulation of G2M
transition and the sensitivity of the TNBC cell lines
to EC-8042, the total amount of those proteins was
measured and plotted against IC50 values (Figure S2).
However, no correlation was found among the levels of
Wee1, pCDK1-Y15 and IC50 values for EC-8042. While
statistically significant correlation failed to be observed
in the case of SP1 and Cdc25c, a trend towards resistance
to the action of EC-8042 was found in cells expressing
higher levels of these proteins. On the other side, higher
levels of Cdc25a appeared to facilitate the action of the
drug.

EC-8042 induces cell death
The increase in cells in the subG1 phase of the cell
cycle, especially in HBL100 cells treated with EC-8042
suggested that the drug stimulated cell death. As shown

experiment repeated three times. C. IC50 values obtained in the different breast cancer cell lines after 72 hours of incubation with EC-8042.

in Figure 4A, treatment with 500 nM of EC-8042 for 48
hours augmented Annexin V staining of HBL100 cells,
and also increased Annexin V staining of MDA-MB231
cells, although to a much lesser extent (Figure 4A and
4B). Treatment with 500 nM EC-8042 resulted in loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential in both HBL100 and
MDA-MB231 cells (Figure 4C), although the effect was
substantially higher in the HBL100 cells, in line with the
increased apoptotic effect of EC-8042 on such cell line.
Members of the BCL2 family of proteins are known to
participate in the regulation of MOMP. We observed that
MCL1 and BCLX levels were down regulated in both cell
lines after treatment with EC-8042 for 48 hours (Figure
4D). We evaluated whether treatment with the drug
caused an increase in caspase activity. Treatment with
EC-8042 provoked an increase in caspase 3 and caspase 8
activities (Figure 4E). The drug also provoked a decrease
in the caspase inhibitor XIAP. Moreover, an increase in
PARP cleavage, indicative of activation of caspases,
was observed in both MDA-MB231 and HBL100 cells

(Figure 4D). To evaluate to which extent caspases were
responsible of the cell death induced by EC-8042 cells
were incubated with the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK before treatment with EC-8042. Addition of the
caspase inhibitor did not inhibit EC-8042-induced cell
death (Figure 4F) indicating that the effect of EC-8042
mainly occurred through caspase-independent processes.
In vivo antitumoral effect of EC-8042
The potential in vivo antitumoral effect of EC-8042
was next investigated. Mice injected with MDA-MB231
cells in the caudal mammary fat pad developed tumors
within two weeks from the date of injection. Once tumors
established and reached a mean volume of 100 mm3, mice
were randomized to receive vehicle or EC-8042 (12 mg/
kg), intravenously every four days. Pharmacokinetic
measurements of EC-8042 concentration in the tumors
at 6 hours after the last treatment indicated that the drug

accumulated at doses higher that those deemed active
in vitro (3.8 μg/g and 2.2 μg/g in two tumors from two
different mice). Treatment with the drug exerted an
inhibitory effect on tumor growth (Figure 5A). Body
weight showed a slight decrease initially in animals treated
with EC-8042, which recovered later (Figure S3).
The definition of the molecular consequences
of the treatment of EC-8042 on cell cycle regulators
reported above guided in performing a pharmacodynamic
assessment of the action of the drug in vivo. Tumors from
control or EC-8042-treated mice removed 6h after the last
treatment showed that tumoral samples from mice treated
with the drug had increased levels of Wee1, pCDK1-Y15,
p27, Cyclin A and Cyclin B (Figure 5B).

useful in TNBC such as the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235
or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib. These studies,
however, failed to indicate a synergistic antitumoral
effect of the combination of EC-8042 with any of them
(Figure S5). In vivo evaluation of the effect of EC-8042
in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin was also
performed. As shown in Figure 6C, the combination of
EC-8042 with docetaxel had a stronger antitumoral effect
than the individual treatments, despite the lack of schedule
optimization of the drug combination. In contrast, and in
agreement with the in vitro data, no potentiation of the
effect of carboplatin by EC-8042 was observed (Figure
S6A). Body weights of animals treated with these drugs or
their combination were not substantially modified by the
treatments (Figure S6B).

EC-8042 synergizes with standard of care drugs
in vitro and in vivo

DISCUSSION
In this paper, we report the antitumoral action of
the mithramycin analog EC-8042 in triple negative breast
cancer. The rationale behind our study is double. On one
hand is the recent identification that mithramycin shows
an antitumoral action on TNBC cells [7]. On the other,
the fact that mithramycin has a narrow therapeutic index
moved us to test a mithralog selected by its lower toxicity
and potentially higher therapeutic window [20].
EC-8042 exerted an antitumoral action both in vitro
and in vivo. In vitro studies carried out in eight TNBC
cell lines showed that the drug provoked a decrease in
MTT metabolization values in a dose and time-dependent
fashion. In vivo, the drug also caused a decrease in the

Antineoplastic treatments are often based on
combinations of agents. To explore whether EC-8042
potentiated the action of drugs used in the therapy of
TNBC, drug combination experiments were performed,
and the results analyzed by the Chou and Talalay
algorithm [23] which is used to determine whether a
drug combination is synergistic, additive or antagonistic
or has no effect. Synergy was observed with docetaxel
and gemcitabine (Figure 6A and 6B), while the action of
vinorelbine (Figure S4) or carboplatin were not clearly
augmented by EC-8042. We also tested the possibility that
EC-8042 favored the action of other drugs which may be

factors, including Sp1 [26], the putative cellular target of
mithramycin and analogs [27]. In addition to strong down
regulation of the levels of Cdc25c, the drug provoked
accumulation of Wee1 which altogether could inactivate
CDK1. These in vitro findings were coincident with the
accumulation of Wee1 and pCDK1-Y15 in tumoral samples
from mice xenografted with MDA-MB231 cells and
treated with EC-8042.
In addition the effects of EC-8042 on the cell
cycle, the drug also caused apoptosis, as indicated by
accumulation of cells in the subG1 region of the histogram
obtained by PI staining. However, the degree of apoptosis
induced by the drug varied among different cell lines.
In HBL100 cells, 500 nM of EC-8042 caused a strong
induction of cell death, while in MDA-MB231 cells the
effect was much lower. Evaluation of the mechanisms
responsible for the cell death induced by the drug
suggested that mitochondria could be involved in such
process, as loss in MOMP was detected in both cell lines
treated with the drug. Such loss in MOMP proportionally
correlated with the degree of cell death induced by the
drug. Interestingly, and even though clear differences were
observed in MOMP loss in MDA-MB231 and HBL100
cells treated with 500 nM of EC-8042, biochemical
analyses of caspase 3 and caspase 8 activation offered
quantitatively similar results. Moreover, cleavage of PARP

growth of tumors developed from TNBC cells implanted
in the mammary tissue of mice. Moreover, EC-8042 also
favored the efficacy of taxanes in vitro and in vivo, and
gemcitabine in vitro, two drugs currently used in the
TNBC clinic. The effects in mice were observed without
any significant effect of the drug on the weight of the
mice, suggesting that the drug was well tolerated.
The mechanism of the antitumoral effect of EC8042 was analyzed using flow cytometry as well as
biochemical techniques. Treatment with the drug induced
accumulation of cells with a diploid amount of DNA,
indicating a blockade in G2 or M. Cell synchronization
experiments using a double thymidine block, following
by chasing of the cells in the absence or presence of
the drug indicated that EC-8042 inhibited entry of cells
in the M phase. Moreover, these experiments showed
that cells treated with the drug evidenced a biochemical
pattern compatible with G2 arrest. In fact, the drug caused
accumulation of pCDK1-Y15. Phosphorylation of CDK1
at that residue inhibits its activity, therefore preventing
cells from entering mitosis [24]. Such phosphorylation is
controlled by the balance between the kinase Wee1 and
the phosphatase Cdc25c [25]. Importantly, treatment with
the drug strongly decreased the amount of Cdc25c, which
is required for the dephosphorylation of pCDK1-Y15. The
levels of Cdc25c are regulated by various transcription

which is often used as readout of caspase 3 activity was
induced by the drug in both cell lines. These data indicated
that activation of caspase cascades were analogous in both
cell lines and the differences in cell death induction by
EC-8042 in the two cell lines could not be explained by
the mere activation of caspases. In support of the latter
were the experiments carried out using the pancaspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. This compound only marginally
inhibited cell death induced by EC-8042 in both cell lines,
suggesting that large part of the proapoptotic action of the
drug was due to activation of caspase-independent routes.
The biochemical characterization of the effects
of EC-8042 on TNBC cells led to the identification of
proteins whose levels could be used to define sensitivity/
resistance to the action of the drug. Analyses of several
proteins involved in G2M cell cycle progression and of
SP1 indicated a certain degree of correlation among some
of them and drug sensitivity. In fact, increased levels
of Cdc25c and Sp1 appeared to confer resistance to the
antitumoral action of EC-8042. It will be interesting to
confirm such idea using genetic approaches to augment or
decrease the levels of these proteins in TNBC cell models.
In summary, we show that the novel mithralog EC8042 exerts antitumoral activity in TNBC. Moreover, EC8042 behaved safely in mice, and augmented the action
of some of the drugs commonly used in the therapy of
TNBC. These biological properties of EC-8042 make this
drug a worthy candidate for future development in the
TNBC clinic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blotting

Reagents and antibodies

MDA-MB231 and HBL100 cells were grown in
DMEM with 10% of FBS and at 80% confluence were
treated with EC-8042 for the times indicated. Cells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (NaCl, 137
mM; KCl, 2.7 mM; Na2HPO4, 8 mM; KH2PO4, 1.5 mM)
and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.0; NaCl, 140 mM; EDTA, 50 mM; 10% glycerol; 1%
Nonidet P-40; 1 μM pepstatin; 1 μg/mL aprotinin; 1 μg/
mL leupeptin; 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride; 1
mM sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were centrifuged at
10,000 xg at 4ºC for 10 minutes, and supernatants were
transferred to new tubes. Samples were then boiled in
electrophoresis sample buffer and run on SDS-PAGE gels
at varying acrylamide concentrations, depending on the
molecular weight of the proteins to be analyzed. After
electrophoresis, the proteins in the gel were transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF) (Millipore
Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). Membranes were

skimmed milk for 1-3 hours and then incubated with the
corresponding antibody for 2-16 hours. After washing
three times with TBST during 10 minutes, membranes
were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or antirabbit secondary antibodies for 30 minutes. After the
secondary antibody, the membranes were washed three
times with TBST and the bands were visualized by using
enhanced chemiluminescence [29].

mL PI. Cells were incubated for 15-30 minutes in the dark.
After adding another 400 µL of binding buffer, labeled
cells were analyzed in a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer.
Analyses of mitochondrial membrane potential in MDAMB231 and HBL100 cells lines have been performed as
described [33].

Caspase activity assay

Cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis assays

MDA-MB231 and HBL100 cells were lysed in
apoptosis lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM
EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% NP40, pH 7.0) supplemented
with protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was
determined by de BCA assay (Pierce) and 50 μg of cell
lysates were placed in 96-well plates in triplicate. The final
volume of the lysates was taken to to 100 μl by 1x Caspase
buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose). One hundred μl of 2
x caspase reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM
NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2% CHAPS, 20% sucrose, 20 mM
DTT and 10 μM fluorescently labelled caspase substrate
Ac-IETD-AFC or Ac-DEVD-AFC) was added to each
well containing cell lysates. The plate was shaken to mix
the solution and incubated at 37ºC for 1 hour from light.
Signals were measured at 400/505 nm in a fluorescent
reader (BioTek).

Cells were plated in 24-well plates at 10,00020,000 cells/well and cultured overnight in DMEM or
RPMI + 10% FBS. The next day medium was replaced
with DMEM or RPMI containing different concentrations
of EC-8042. Cell proliferation was analyzed 48 and 72
hours later by an MTT-based assay as described [30].
Unless otherwise indicated, the results are presented as
the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of quadruplicates of a
representative experiment that was repeated at least three
times.
To determine whether the combinations of EC8042 with BEZ235, dasatinib, carboplatin, docetaxel,
vinorelbine, or gemcitabine were synergistic, additive, or
antagonistic we used the CalcuSyn v2.0 software program
(Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) as described [31]. Results are
plotted as the mean ±SD values of quadruplicates from
two experiments.
For the analysis of the cell cycle profiles, cells were
treated with EC-8042 during 48 hours and subsequently
collected by pooling together the nonattached and
attached cells. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed
and permeabilized by ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight.
Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 500 µL of PBS
containing 250 µg DNase-free RNAase A (Sigma-Aldrich)
and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Then, 2.5
µg of propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich) were added.
DNA content and cell cycle analyses were performed
using a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer and the C6 software
(BD Biosciences).
To analyze the effect of EC-8042 on the different
phases of cell cycle, cells were synchronized in G1/S. To
enrich cells in G1/S, cells were treated with thymidine (2
mM during 14 hours) as described [32]. Then the cells
were treated with EC-8042 at different times and DNA
content and cell cycle analyses were performed using a
FACScalibur flow cytometer and the CellQuest software
(BD Biosciences).
For apoptotic analyses, MDA-MB231 and
HBL100 cells were treated with EC-8042 for 48 hours
and subsequently collected by pooling together the
nonattached and attached cells. Then, cells were washed
with PBS and resuspended in 100 µL of binding buffer
(10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4; 140 mM NaCl; 2.5
mM CaCl2) containing 5 µL of Annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC; BD Biosciences) and 5 µL of 50 µg/

Xenograft studies
Mice were manipulated at the animal facility of
the Centro de Investigación del Cáncer of Salamanca
following legal guidelines. Female BALB/c nu/nu
mice (7 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). A total of 5x106
MDA-MB231 cells in 100 μl of DMEM and 100 μl of
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected subcutaneously
into the right and left flank of each mouse. When tumours
reached a mean volume of 100 mm3, animals (n = 32)
were randomized into four groups (with equal average
tumour volumes) (vehicle n = 8, EC-8042 n = 8, docetaxel
n = 8, and EC-8042+docetaxel n = 8). Mice were treated
every four days intravenously with 12 mg/kg of EC-8042,
and weekly, intraperitoneally with docetaxel 15 mg/kg.
Tumour diameters were serially measured by calliper
twice per week and tumour volumes were calculated by
the following formula: volume = width2 x length/2. Mice
were sacrificed on day 41. For biochemical and drug
accumulation analyses, tumor samples were obtained
after sacrifice of the animals by CO2 inhalation, and 6
hours after being treated with the different drugs, and
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tumors were
minced, washed with PBS, and homogenized (Dispomix,
L&M Biotech, Holly Springs, NC, USA) in ice-cold lysis
buffer (1.5 ml/ 100 mg tumour). This homogenate was
centrifuged at 10,000 xg for 20 minutes at 4ºC, and the
