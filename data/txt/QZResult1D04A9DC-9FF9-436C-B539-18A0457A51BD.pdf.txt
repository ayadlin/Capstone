ABSTRACT
Activation of IκB kinase β (IKK-β) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling
contributes to cancer pathogenesis and inflammatory disease; therefore, the
IKK-β−NF-κB signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic target. Current drug
design strategies focus on blocking NF-κB signaling by binding to specific cysteine
residues on IKK-β. However, mutations in IKK-β have been found in patients who may
eventually develop drug resistance. For these patients, a new generation of IKK-β
inhibitors are required to provide novel treatment options. We demonstrate in vitro
that cysteine-46 (Cys-46) is an essential residue for IKK-β kinase activity. We then
validate the role of Cys-46 in the pathogenesis of inflammation using delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) and an IKK-β C46A transgenic mouse model. We show that a
novel IKK-β inhibitor, dihydromyricetin (DMY), has anti-inflammatory effects on WT
DTH mice but not IKK-β C46A transgenic mice. These findings reveal the role of Cys46 in the promotion of inflammatory responses, and suggest that Cys-46 is a novel
drug-binding site for the inhibition of IKK-β.

INTRODUCTION

causal link between hepatic IKK-β and NF-κB-accelerated
sub-acute inflammation that culminates in chronic disease,
such as obesity-induced insulin resistance [9, 10].
Suppression of the IKK-β-NF-κB signaling
pathway has become a trendy new strategy for drug
design. For example, several IKK-β inhibitors, such as
beta-carbolines, BMS-345541, SC-514, CHS 828, and
SAR113945, are currently in preclinical and clinical trials
[11-19]. Each drugs’ inhibitory activity varies depending
on its binding affinity to specific functional sites on IKK-β,
including the cysteine (Cys)-179 residue, the ATP binding
domain, the allosteric domain, and serine (Ser)-177/-181
residues [12, 14, 15, 20, 21]. However, many of these
sites, or other unidentified sites are variants in patients [7,
22-25], altering the effects of these drugs. Therefore, it is
important to develop IKK-β inhibitors with new binding

Disease pathogenesis, drug response, drug
resistance, and drug toxicity are all correlated with
the genetic background of individual patients [1-3];
therefore, personalized therapies targeting specific genes
or gene mutations are highly desirable [4, 5]. Activation
of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factors is
commonly involved in the pathogenesis of immune
diseases, inflammation, and cancer [6]. NF-κB activation
is stimulated by a kinase complex, IκB kinase (IKK),
which is composed of three core proteins: two catalytic
subunits, IKK-α, IKK-β, and one regulatory subunit,
IKK-γ (NEMO) [7]. Among these three subunits, IKK-β
promotes NF-κB signaling and the pathogenesis and
progression of inflammatory diseases [8]. There is also a

sites and/or tailor-make treatments for patients with IKK-β
mutations. As cysteine residues participate in the catalysis
and activation of IKK-β [26-28], the identification
and characterization of cysteine mutations in IKK-β is
essential to unravel the pathogenesis of IKK-β-related
diseases and broaden the spectrum of novel IKK-β-based
drug design [29-32].
In this study, we generated a new IKK-βC46A
transgenic mouse model with a Cys-46 mutation in IKK-β,
as well as a panel of IKK-β mutant constructs to investigate
the role of the Cys-46 residue in the inflammatory
process. We demonstrated that homozygosity for IKKβC46A increases IKK-β kinase activity both in vitro and in
vivo. We further showed that delayed-type hypersensitivity
(DTH) in the homozygous IKK-βC46A mutant mice
resulted in severe inflammation and diminished the antiinflammatory effects of dihydromyricetin (DMY), a
novel IKK-β inhibitor derived from the medicinal plant
Ampelopsis megalophylla. These results suggest that Cys46 is an important residue for the suppression of IKK-β
kinase activity and inflammatory responses. Moreover,
IKK-β Cys-46 mutant constructs and homozygous
IKK-βC46A transgenic mice may be useful tools for drug
screening and in vivo validation.

mg/ear) caused a 53.79% suppression of DNFB-mediated
ear edema in WT mice, whereas this suppression was
only 16.77% in IKK-βC46A mice (Figure 1D). By contrast,
dexamethasone (DEX), showed similar suppressive
effects in both WT and IKK-βC46A mice (Figure 1C & 1D).
These results suggest that IKK-βC46A are resistant to DMY
treatment.
Effector CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes are stimulated
in DNFB-induced DTH [33], and are increased in ear
sections of DNFB-treated IKK-βC46A mice when compared
to WT. While the number of CD8+ lymphocytes gradually
decreases in WT mice, this does not occur in IKK-βC46A
mice (Figure 1E & 1F & Figure S3), suggesting that CD8+
lymphocytes are involved in the anti-inflammatory actions
of DMY [4].
Topical application of DMY reduced ear edema
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A) by suppressing
p65 NF-κB signaling in ear tissues of the DMY-treated
DTH mice (Figure 2B). DMY treatment caused no adverse
effects to spleen or thymus and no loss of body weight
(Figure 2C & 2D), while adverse responses were observed
in DEX-treated mice. In the Collagen Induced Arthritis
(CIA) rat model [12], DMY reduced arthritic scores and
hind paw volume in comparison with vehicle-treated
CIA rats (Figure 3A & 3B). DMY also suppressed p65
NF-κB signaling in knee synovial tissues of the CIA rats
(Figure 3C), without impairment to the organ indexes
(Figure 3D) or body weights (Figure 3E). Taken together,
our data suggest that DMY binds to Cys-46 of IKK-β and
suppresses inflammation in vivo.

RESULTS
The small molecule dihydromyricetin (DMY)
binds to Cys-46 of IKK-β and suppresses
inflammation

DMY covalently binds the Cys-46 binding site of
IKK-β

Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that
mutation of IKK-β cysteine-46 to alanine (C46A)
increased kinase activity in vitro (Figure 1A). To
assess the function of this mutant kinase in vivo, we
generated homozygous IKK-βC46A transgenic (IKK-βC46A)
mice and examined their inflammatory response to
dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). When compared with wildtype (WT) mice, IKK-β protein immunoprecipitated from
IKK-βC46A kidneys had increased kinase activity (Figure
1B). IKK-βC46A mice treated with DNFB displayed stronger
inflammatory responses than WT mice, with increased ear
thickness (Figure 1C & 1D). Taken together, these results
indicate that cysteine-46 is a reactive residue that regulates
IKK-β kinase activity.
Given that reactive cysteines can bind with small
molecules via redox reactions or Michael addition
[28], we next examined whether the small molecule,
dihydromyricetin (DMY), could bind with cysteine-46
to exert an anti-inflammatory effect. DMY suppressed
IKK-β-NF-κB signaling, T cell activation, and cytokine
production in purified human T lymphocytes (Figure S1
& S2), but its anti-inflammatory effects were diminished
in IKK-βC46A mice (Figure 1C & 1D). DMY treatment (2

Computational docking analysis gave a docking
score of -14.06 to DMY with the binding domain of
IKK-β, but their binding mode was not facilitated by
hydrophobic, polar, or hydrogen-bond interactions.
Accordingly, DMY was predicted to form hydrogen
bonds with the backbone of Cys-46, Gln-48, Lys-53 and
Asn-54 in the proposed IKK-β binding domain (Figure
4A), indicating that Cys-46 might be a key residue to
facilitate DMY binding. To determine the nature of the
interaction between DMY and Cys-46 of IKK-β and detect
their direct binding, biotinylated DMY (DMY-biotin) was
synthesized as a probe (Figure 4B). Functional assays
showed that DMY-biotin suppressed PMA/ionomycin
(P/I)-activated T cell proliferation, NF-κB signaling, and
IKK-β kinase activity similarly to normal DMY (Figure
4C-4E), indicating that addition of the biotin moiety did
not impair DMY function. A competitive binding assay
revealed direct binding between DMY-biotin and IKK-β,
showing clearly formed DMY-biotin/FLAG-tagged IKK-β
adducts, whereas addition of unlabeled DMY reduced this
binding (Figure 4F). Furthermore, binding of DMY-biotin
to recombinant IKK-β was dose-dependently competed

away by unlabeled DMY (Figure 4G), suggesting that
the binding sites of DMY and DMY-biotin are conserved.
Although our computational docking predicted only the
hydrogen-bond interaction between DMY and Cys-46
of IKK-β, the DMY-biotin/FLAG-tagged IKK-β adducts
detected by SDS-PAGE suggested the covalent linkage of
DMY with IKK-β protein (Figure 4F).

(C) with alanine (A) (Figure 6C). Except C618A, all the
mutants retained their kinase activities, as determined
by phosphorylation of IκBα. Importantly, mutation of
Cys-46 (C46A) abrogated the inhibitory effects of DMY,
on IKK-β kinase activity and the formation of protein
adducts with DMY-biotin (Figure 6C, 6D, 6E). We
next derived embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from IKKβ-deficient (IKK-β-/-) mice. IKK-β-/- MEFs transfected
with WT IKK-β, but not with IKK-β (C46A) displayed
reduced TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65
and degradation of IκBα (Figure 6F), further confirming
that Cys-46 on IKK-β is the key residue for DMY-induced
suppression of NF-κB signaling.

DMY suppresses IKK-β activity via a novel drug
binding site
We next characterized the binding capability of
DMY with the known drug-targeted regions of IKK-β,
including the Cys-179 binding site for manumycin
A, butein, berberine and arsenite [21, 26, 27, 34], and
the homotypic dimerization residues Cys-662/-716 for
manumycin A [26]. Using an in vitro IKK-β kinase assay,
we found that DMY suppressed IκBα phosphorylation in
both WT and mutant (C179A and C662A/C716A) IKK-β
transfectants (Figure 5A). In addition, incubation of both
WT and mutant IKK-β proteins with DMY-biotin led
to the formation of IKK-β-DMY adducts (Figure 5B).
Thus, Cys-179, -662 and -716 on IKK-β are likely not the
binding sites of DMY. Other than these cysteine residues,
Phe-26 (F26) in the ATP-binding site of IKK-β is the key
residue for the ATP-binding competitor PHA-408 [35].
DMY effectively suppressed the kinase activity of an F26A
IKK-β mutant compared to the IKK-β WT (Figure 5C),
and the labeled DMY probe bound and formed protein
adducts with this mutant (Figure 5D), indicating that DMY
does not bind to Phe-26. Next, we used DMY-biotin in an
IKK-β displacement assay to compete with well-known
IKK-β inhibitors: SC-514, an ATP-competitive inhibitor;
berberine, a Cys-179-targeting inhibitor; BMS-345541, an
allosteric domain inhibitor; and BOT-64, a Ser-177/-181targeting inhibitor (Figure 5E). None of these inhibitors
competed with DMY-biotin (Figure 5F). Thus, DMY
suppresses kinase activity and decreases inflammation via
a novel drug-binding region on IKK-β.

DISCUSSION
Somatic mutations in target genes are major
impediments to successful targeted cancer therapies.
For instance, the survival rates of non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLCs) patients with EGFR mutations were
improved by first-generation epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib;
however, 50% of these patients will acquire resistance
and ultimately relapse due to a second mutation on EGFR
(T790M) [36, 37]. In 2009, WZ4002, a new mutantselective EGFR kinase inhibitor was identified which
selectively inhibits EGFR in patients with the T790M
mutation [38].
Nonsense and frameshift mutations of IKK-β have
been identified in patients who present with a severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) disease phenotype
[7, 22-25, 39-41]. Moreover, mutations in IKK-β and
its related genes, such as IκBα, IKK-β and IKK-γ are
commonly found in patients with immune deficiencies
and inflammatory diseases [7], suggesting that somatic
mutations often occur among patients with inflammatory
conditions. Among the known drug-binding regions
of IKK-β, mutations of Phe-26 at the ATP binding site
or Cys-179 in the kinase domain abrogate the kinaseinhibiting effects of PHA-408 [35] and other Cys-179targeting compounds [21, 26, 27, 29, 34, 42, 43]. Patients
suffering from inflammatory and autoimmune diseases are
usually treated with drugs possessing IKK-β inhibitory
effects, such as the ATP-competitive IKK-β inhibitor,
sulfasalazin [44] or Cys-179-targeting compounds
including xanthohumol [45] and TPCK [46]. Patients
with long-term treatment will develop drug resistance
due to IKK-β somatic mutations in drug binding sites [4750]. Therefore, to overcome drug-resistant phenotypes in
immune diseases caused by somatic mutations, we need to
discover novel IKK-β inhibitors with different inhibitory
mechanisms or new drug binding domains.
In our study, we found a new inflammationpromoting role for Cys-46 in IKK-β. We demonstrated that
DMY has an inhibitory effect on IKK-β kinase activity
and suppresses NF-κB signaling through direct binding to

The Cysteine-46 residue, a novel DMY binding
site on IKK-β is responsible for suppression of
IKK--β − ΝF-κB signaling
The thiol-containing cysteine residue of IKK-β is
bound and suppressed by cyclopentenone prostaglandins
and CDDO, and these interactions are abolished by
dithiothreitol (DTT) [28, 29]. DMY-induced suppression
of IKK-β-NF-κB signaling was reversed by DTT, as well
(Figure 6A & 6B), suggesting that DMY suppresses IKK-β
activity via the thiol-containing cysteine residues of IKK-β.
To further determine whether the cysteine residue(s) on
IKK-β are essential for the anti-inflammatory actions of
DMY, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate all
15 remaining IKK-β point mutants by replacing cysteine

ainsliadimer A, was found to selectively bind to the Cys46 residue of IKK-α/β and inhibit its activities through an
allosteric effect [51]. Our data is in line with their data,
and further supports that Cys-46 residue is a new drugbinding site for kinase inhibition. Importantly, DMY was

and

The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of DMY
was examined by using the mouse delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) test based on a previously
described method [52]. The ear samples of DTH mice
were fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formalin. Each
sample was cut longitudinally in half and embedded
in paraffin (Panreac), and then cut into 5 μm sections.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed on slides
according to a previous report [53]. In brief, sections were
deparaffinized in xylene, subsequently immersed in graded
alcohol (100%, 95%, 70% ethanol), rehydrated in ddH2O
before antigen retrieval by microwave. The sections were
incubated with antibodies against CD4 (1:20 dilution)
and CD8 (1:100 dilution) (BD Pharmingen Inc.) at 4ºC
overnight. The LSABTM+ system (Dako Com., CA) was
used to detect these antigens in tissues. The sections were
developed with DAB and lightly counterstained with
hematoxylin, then rinsed and immersed briefly in acid
alcohol. The slides were further rinsed and soaked in
Scott’s tap water for 5 min. Finally, slides were dehydrated
and mounted with Permount and covered with Fisherfinest
glass cover slips (Thermo-Fisher) for microscopic
observation and scoring.

and OKT3 were from BD Pharmingen Inc. (San Diego,
CA, USA). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and
ionomycin were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem,
respectively. All primary antibodies used in this study were
purchased from Santa Cruz, Calbiochem, Cell Signaling,
BD Pharmingen or Sigma. The expression plasmids of
FLAG-tagged IKKβ and its single mutant C179A and the
double mutant C662A/C716A were gifts from Professor
Tom Gilmore (Boston University). DMY was encapsulated
with hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin (HP-CD) (1:8.48) and
then dissolved in normal saline for administration at
dosages of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. To measure the acute
toxicity of DMY, the average LD50 of DMY was 1251.11
mg/kg/day in mice by intraperitoneal injection. Male ICR
mice weighing 22-30 g and female Wistar rats that were
5-6 weeks old were obtained from the Laboratory Animal
Services Center, Chinese University of Hong Kong (Hong
Kong, China). All animals were fed a standard diet ad
libitum. Housing conditions and all in vivo experiments
were approved under regulations of the Committee on Use
of Human and Animal Subjects in Teaching and Research
(HASC) of the Department of Health in Hong Kong.

Experimental arthritis induced by collagen II in
rats
Collagen II-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced
in female Wistar rats as described previously [54].
Dexamethasone (DEX, 0.1 mg/kg), methotrexate (MTX,
3.75 mg/kg, twice per week) and indomethacin (Indo, 1
mg/kg) were used as reference drugs.

Generation of IKK-βC46A transgenic mice

IKK-β competition and displacement assay

Data Bank (PDB ID code 3RZF [55]. The DMY structure
was then subjected to energy minimization and partial
charges calculation with an Amber99 force field. Energy
minimization was terminated when the root mean square
gradient fell below 0.05 kcal/(mol·Å). The docking sites
were identified using Site Finder in MOE software.
The identified binding sites, including residue Cys-46,
were chosen as the binding sites for molecular docking
according to our experiment. In molecular docking, the
Triangle Matcher placement method and London dG
scoring function were used. A total of 30 docking poses
were generated for the ligand, and the pose with the best
binding mode was selected for further analysis.

For the IKK-β competition assay, recombinant
IKK-β was incubated with 100 µM DMY-biotin with
addition of 100 µM or 200 µM unlabeled DMY at room
temperature for 1 h. The mixtures were then pipetted onto
nitrocellulose membrane, followed by BSA blocking
and PBS-T washing. For the IKK-β displacement assay,
FLAG-IKK-β (wt)-transfected human HEK293 cells
were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG
antibody, then incubated with 100 µM DMY-biotin in the
presence of DMY, berberine, SC-514, BMS-345541 or
BOT-64. The reaction samples were separated by SDSPAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using streptavidin
horseradish peroxidase antibodies.

IKK-β kinase assay and NF-κB luciferase reporter
assay

Cloning and expression

An IKK-β kinase assay was performed using a
K-LISATM IKKβ-Inhibitor Screening Kit (Calbiochem) as
described previously [56].

The FLAG-IKK-β (wt) construct was used as a
template to introduce the point mutations of cysteine (C)
or phenylalanine (F) replaced by alanine (A), including
C12A, C46A, C59A, C99A, C114A, C115A, C215A,
C299A, C370A, C412A, C444A, C464A, C524A, C618A,
C751A and F26A mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis
was performed using the Stratagene QuickChange
Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. IKK-β-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
were provided as a gift by Prof Michael Karin (University
of California, San Diego).

Synthesis of biotinylated DMY (DMY-Biotin)
Biotin (24.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) was suspended in
dimethylformamide/dichloromethane (1:1, 2 mL), and
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (20.6 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added.
After stirring at 60°C for 5 min, dimethylaminopyridine
(12.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) and DMY (48 mg, 0.15 mmol) in
dimethylformamide (0.5 mL) were added. After stirring
overnight, the mixture was poured into water (50 mL),
acidified with 3 M HCl to pH 3.0, and then extracted with
ethyl acetate (20 mL ×3). Residue of the organic layer was
subjected to silica gel chromatography (petroleum ether:
acetone from 4:3 to 1:3) to produce a yellow solid (25.1
mg, 46%). Negative HR-ESI-MS with m/z 545.1203 [MH]− was determined from biotinylated DMY (calculated
for C25H25N2O10S: 545.1230).

Human T lymphocyte isolation, purification,
stimulation and proliferation
Human peripheral blood T lymphocytes were
isolated from buffy coat blood and were activated
following previous stimulation protocols [57, 58]. Briefly,
the buffy coat provided by Macao Blood Transfusion
Centre or Red Cross Association of Hong Kong was
mixed with normal saline, and then added to 50 mL
centrifuge tube containing Ficoll-Pague plus (Amersham
Biosciences, USA). After centrifugation at 350 g for 35
min, the mixture was separated into several layers. The
layer of mononuclear cells was collected and purified by
magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACs) pan T cell kit
(Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). The purified T cells were
stimulated by 20 ng/mL PMA plus 1 μM ionomycin
(P/I) or OKT3 (5 μg/mL) plus CD28 mAb (1 μg/mL)
in the experiments with different time intervals for later
experiments. The effects of DMY on T cell proliferation
were investigated by the cell proliferation kit (Roche,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. In brief,
human T lymphocytes (1×105/well) were cultured in 96well plates in triplicate in RPMI 1640 media plus 10%
FBS, and then stimulated with 20 ng/mL PMA plus 1 μM

Binding of DMY-biotin to IKKβ
HEK293 cells were transfected with a WT or
mutant FLAG-IKKβ construct using Lipofectamine
PLUS LTX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Whole-cell lysates were
then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody
and then incubated with 100 µM DMY-biotin. The
immunoprecipitated FLAG-IKK-β-DMY-biotin ligands
were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 1%
BSA and washing with PBS-T [Tween-20 0.05%], the
membranes were incubated with streptavidin horseradish
peroxidase (Sigma) for 1 h and developed using ECL
Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Invitrogen).
