ABSTRACT:
Many types of mutations in tumor suppressor p53 are oncogenic through gainof-function. Therefore, targeting mutant p53 (mtp53) is a promising therapeutic
approach to fight against many types of cancers. We report here a small molecule
compound YK-3-237 that reduces acetylation of mtp53 and exhibits anti-proliferative
effects toward triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells carrying mtp53. YK-3-237
activates SIRT1 enzyme activities in vitro and deacetylation of both mtp53 and wild
type p53 (WTp53) in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Deacetylation of mtp53 resulted
in depletion of mtp53 protein level and up-regulated the expression of WTp53-target
genes, PUMA and NOXA. YK-3-237 also induces PARP-dependent apoptotic cell death
and arrests the cell cycle at G2/M phase in mtp53 TNBC cells. Taken together, our
data suggest that targeting acetylation of mtp53 is a potential target to treat human
cancers.

INTRODUCTION

originally described as a tumor protein (or oncoprotein)
and subsequent investigations have revealed that WTp53
has roles as a tumor suppressor and protects cells from
malignant transformation [5-8]. In general, mutation of
p53 results in stabilization and accumulation of mtp53
proteins in cells, while WTp53 is tightly regulated by
post-translational modification coupled with proteasomal
degradation. First reports appeared to support that
mutation of p53 simply causes a loss of tumor suppressor
function. Recent advances, however, have demonstrated
that mtp53 possess pro-oncogenic potential through
gain of functions such as transcriptional repression and
activation, coaggregation with other tumor suppressors,
and so on [5-8]. Therefore, targeting mtp53 pathways may
represent a promising approach in the development of
novel anti-cancer agents [4,6]. Because mtp53 has many
types of mutations and functions, distinct strategies will be
required for therapeutic targeting [6].
Silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) proteins,
or surtuins (SIRTs), are evolutionally conserved

TNBCs are immunohistologically characterized by
lack of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor
(PR) as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2) amplification, and ~20% of all breast cancers
are identified as TNBCs [1]. TNBC tumors are a group
of heterogeneous cancers and substantial overlapped
with basal-like breast cancer [1]. Although early TNBCs
have higher response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
patients with advanced disease show poor response and
rapid progression of disease than patients with other types
of breast cancers [2]. Currently, there are no therapies that
target TNBCs [2,3].
Breast tumors with p53 mutations were mostly
classified into basal-like or HER2-amplified subgroup,
while luminal subgroup of breast cancers almost
exclusively expresses WTp53 [4]. Tumor suppressor
protein p53 is a cellular guardian and mutations of p53
are found ~50% of human cancers [5-8]. In fact, p53 is

enzyme family acting as protein deacetylases/ADP
ribosyltransferases [9-12]. At least 7 enzymes of this
class have been identified in humans (SIRT1-7). Among
these proteins, class I sirtuins (SIRT1-3) and SIRT5
showed deacetylase activity [9-12]. It has been reported
that SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT6 appear
to act as tumor suppressors in certain conditions [13-

17]. Since varied reports on tumor suppressor function
of SIRT1 have been reported [18,19], SIRT1 activators
could be useful for treatment or prevention of certain type
of cancers [9-12]. In addition to resveratrol, a series of
compounds are reported as potent SIRT1 activators [2024]. More recently, years-long debates on the activation of
SIRT1 by these compounds [25-28] were resolved by two

YK-3-237 is originated as a boronic acid chalcone
analog of combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) [31]. Unlike CA4, YK-3-237 did not bind to tubulin in vitro [31] and
exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity toward a broad
range of NCI cancer cell lines with unknown mechanism
[31]. Here we report that YK-3-237 deacetylates mtp53
through SIRT1 and inhibits the proliferation of TNBC cell
lines carrying mtp53.

of mtp53 protein are much higher than that of WTp53. As
expected, expression of ERα was not detected in TNBC
cell lines (Sup Figure 2). Notably, no significant difference
in the level of SIRT1 protein was observed in our breast
cancer cell line panel (Sup Figure 2). To determine the
effect of YK-3-237 on the level of mtp53, western blot
analysis was further performed with cell lysates from
TNBC cells treated with 1 µM of YK-3-237 for 24 hr. We
found that YK-3-237 (1 µM) reduced the level of mtp53
protein in all TNBC cell lines tested after 24 hr treatment
(Figure 1D).

RESULTS

YK-3-237 deacetylates mtp53 in TNBC cell lines

YK-3-237 inhibits the proliferation of TNBC cells

Previously it has been reported that the stability of
WTp53 is post-translationally regulated by acetylation
at K382 residue [33]. Recently, mtp53 has also been
reported to be regulated by acetylation [34]. Based on
these findings, we further analysed the acetylation status
of mtp53 in TNBC cell lines treated with YK-3-237 by
western blot analysis. Twenty four hour treatment of YK3-237 reduced both the acetylation of K382 and the level
of mtp53 in a dose-dependent manner in mtp53 TNBC cell
lines (Figure 1E). We observed that treatment of YK-3-237
had little or no significant effect on the level of SIRT1,
one of the deacetylases for p53 [35, 36], in mtp53 TNBC
cell lines upto 10 µM (Sup Figure 3A). The deacetylation
of mtp53 was observed as early as 4 hr after treatment
of YK-3-237 without significant reduction in mtp53 level
(Sup Figure 3B).
Since SIRT1 is a well-known deacetylase for p53
on K382 residue, we further addressed whether YK-3-237
affects SIRT enzyme activity by in vitro SIRT assay with
a fluorophore-conjugated peptide substrate. As shown in
Figure 2A, YK-3-237 activated SIRT1 enzyme activities

Previously it has been reported that YK-3-237
(Figure 1A) exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity
toward a broad range of NCI cancer cell lines with
unknown mechanism [31]. To further determine the
anti-proliferative effects of YK-3-237, we performed
the cell viability assay with a panel of breast cancer cell
lines. Cells were treated with increasing concentration
of YK-3-237 up to 72 hr and viable cells were measured
by MTT assay. Notably, YK-3-237 exhibited the antiproliferative activities toward most of the breast cancer
cell lines tested at submicromolar concentration (Table
1 and Sup Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1B, YK-3-237
more preferentially inhibited the proliferation of breast
cancer cell lines carrying mtp53. As previously reported
[4], most of TNBC cell lines in this study are expressing
mtp53 (Table 1). Western blot analysis showed that the
levels of p53 protein (data not shown) are highly elevated
in TNBC cell lines carrying mutations of p53 gene (Figure
1C). Although cells with WTp53 such as MCF7 and ZR75-1 expressed detectable levels of p53 protein, the levels

in a dose-dependent manner. Under this condition, a
SIRT1/2 inhibitor suramin [37] antagonized YK-3-237mediated SIRT1 activation. Interestingly YK-3-237 was
more potent to activate SIRT1 activity than resveratrol
and maximal activation was observed at 10 µM (Sup
Figure 4A). Moreover, YK-3-237 effectively reduced the
survival of SUM149PT cells as compared resveratrol in
a long-term survival assay (Sup Figure 4B). YK-3-237
also activated the SIRT2 enzyme in vitro and enhanced
the deacetylation of α-tubulin (K40) in HS578T cells (Sup
Figure 4C and D).

To exclude potential artifacts from the in vitro
assay, we further confirmed SIRT1 activation by YK-3237 using a p53-Luc reporter gene assay (Figure 2B-C).
Since acetylation of WTp53 has been known to induce its
stabilization and transcriptional activation [33], we used
WTp53 to monitor deacetylase activity of SIRT1 by YK3-237. MCF7 cells were transfected with p53-Luc reporter
plasmid and WTp53 expression vector in the presence
or absence of SIRT1 or dominant negative (DN)-SIRT1
expression vector [38] and further treated with YK-3-237.
As expected, YK-3-237 repressed the WTp53-mediated

activation of p53-Luc reporter gene in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2B, lanes 1~4). Under this condition,
co-expression of SIRT1 reduced the p53-Luc reporter
activity induced by WTp53 and co-treatment of YK-3237 further enhanced the SIRT1-mediated repression of
p53-Luc reporter (Figure 2B, lanes 5~7). On the contrary,
DN-SIRT1 did not repress the p53-mediated reporter gene
activation. In addition, repression of the p53-Luc reporter
by YK-3-237 was limited in the presence of DN-SIRT1
(Figure 2B, lanes 9 and 10).
The effect of SIRT1 knockdown (SIRT1-KD) on the
WTp53-mediated transcription was also tested in MCF7
cells. MCF7 cells were transfected by either control- or
SIRT1-siRNA followed by transfection of p53-Luc and
further treated with increasing amounts (1~10 µM) of
YK-3-237. Under these conditions, SIRT1-KD slightly
induced p53-Luc reporter activity (Figure 2C). While YK3-237 reduced the p53-Luc reporter activity in controlsiRNA-transfected cells, SIRT1-KD antagonized YK-3237-mediated repression of p53-Luc activity. These results
suggest that the repression of WTp53 transcriptional
activity by YK-3-237 is, at least in part, dependent on the
presence of functional SIRT1.
SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of mtp53 was
further investigated in two mtp53 cell lines, HS578T and
SUM149PT. First, HS578T cells were pre-treated with 10

µM of suramin for 1 hr and further treated with 1 µM of
YK-3-237 for 23 hr. As shown in Figure 2D, pre-treatment
of suramin reversed both deacetylation of mtp53 (K382)
and reduction of mtp53 protein. Second, the effect of
SIRT1-KD on the YK-3-237 activity was determined in
SUM149PT cells. After transfection of either controlor SIRT1-siRNA, the cells were further treated with
increasing amount of YK-3-237 for 4 hr. Under this
condition, knockdown of SIRT1 increased acetyl-mtp53
in SUM149PT cells (Figure 2E). In addition, knockdown
of SIRT1 reversed deacetylation of mtp53 by YK-3-237
(Figure 2E). Taken together, these results suggest that YK3-237 activates the SIRT1 enzyme activity in vitro and
deacetylates both wild type and mutant p53 in cells in a
SIRT1-dependent manner.

YK-3-237 induces WTp53-target gene expression
in TNBC cell lines carrying mtp53
Previously, it has been reported that mtp53
reduces p63/p73-mediated transcriptional activation of
WTp53-target genes such as NOXA, GADD45, p21,
BAX, p53AIP-1, IGFBP3, p53R2, cyclin G1, hTERT,
and MDM2 [39-42] and knockdown of mtp53 activates
expression of WTp53-target genes in a cell type-specific

manner [40]. Specifically, knockdown of mtp53 was
reported to induce the expression of GADD45, PTEN and
PERP mRNA in a hepatoma cell line HUH-7, GADD45
and p21 mRNA in a breast cancer cell line T47D, and p21
mRNA in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE-2
[40]. Consistent with these reports, knockdown of mtp53
in two TNBC cell lines, HS578T and MDA-MB-468,
induced the mRNA expression of PUMA and NOXA
(Figure 3A). Quantitative real time-PCR analysis further
confirmed the YK-3-237-mediated induction of WTp53target genes, PUMA and NOXA in three different TNBC
cell lines, HS578T, MDA-MB-468, and SUM149PT
(Figure 3B). These results suggest that the reduction
of mtp53 level by YK-3-237-mediated deacetylation
functionally and specifically releases transcriptional
suppression of WTp53 target genes by mtp53 proteins in
these cells.

4A). TNBC cells treated with YK-3-237 were markedly
arrested at G2/M phase (Figure 4B). In addition, sub-G1
fractions were also drastically increased by YK-3-237
within 24 hr post-treatment in TNBC cells with mtp53
(Figure 4B).

DISCUSSION
In this study we found that the small molecule YK3-237 reduced the proliferation of a broad range of breast
cancer cell lines carrying mtp53. YK-3-237 reduced the
level of mtp53 by removing acetyl group from its K382
residue in a SIRT1-dependent manner. In addition, YK-3237 activated in vitro enzyme activity of purified human
SIRT1 more potently than resveratrol. In cells carrying
WTp53, YK-3-237 enhanced SIRT1-mediated repression
of transcriptional activation by WTp53. Similar to mtp53KD, YK-3-237 induced mRNA expression of PUMA and
NOXA and caused apoptotic cell death of TNBC cells.
Since more than 50% of human cancers possess
mutations of p53, mtp53 represents a potentially important
anti-cancer target [4,6]. More importantly, the active
oncogenic potential by gain-of-function of mtp53s stresses
this approach as a broad range therapeutic opportunity.
Many attempts, however, have failed because of the
diverse character of mtp53 [6]. Molecules that restore

YK-3-237 induces apoptotic cell death in TNBC
cells
It has been well established that induction of WTp53
target genes arrests cells to G2 phase of cell cycle and
finally leads cells to apoptotic cell death [43]. In fact, YK3-237 induced PARP cleavage, a hallmark of caspasedependent apoptosis, within 24 hr post-treatment (Figure

the wild-type conformation of mtp53 such as PRIMA-1
[44], MIRA-1 [45], CP-31398 [46], and P53R3 [47]
have effects on specific types of mtp53. More recently,
a HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG has been suggested as an
alternative approach to reduce the proliferation of a broad
range cancer cell lines carrying various types of mtp53
[48]. In this study, inhibiting HSP90 by 17AAG disrupted
the molecular chaperone complex to liberate mtp53 for
degradation by MDM2.
The mechanism of hyperstabilization of mtp53
is largely unknown. The stabilization of p53 proteins
are thought to be regulated by post-translational
modifications. For WTp53, acetylation of K382 residue
has been proposed as an important determinant to stabilize
the WTp53 protein [33]. Although mtp53 is known to be
acetylated [34], the roles of these acetylations of mtp53
still need to further investigation. We demonstrated in this
study that mtp53 is acetylated at K382 residue in TNBC
cell lines and a small molecule compound YK-3-237
reduced this acetylation of mtp53 and depleted the level
of mtp53. In addition, YK-3-237 activated SIRT1 enzyme
activity in vitro and the deacetylation of either WTp53 or
mtp53 was evidently dependent on SIRT1 activity, which
was demonstrated by overexpression of wild type or
DN-SIRT1, SIRT1-KD, and SIRT1 inhibition by a small
molecule inhibitor, regardless of mtp53 types. However,
the molecular mechanism of SIRT1 activation by YK-3237 needs to be further elucidated. As reported recently
[29], YK-3-237 could activate in vitro SIRT1 activity in
the presence of aminomethylcoumarin (AMC)-tagged
peptide derived from p53 protein. Contrarily, YK-3-237
could not activate in vitro SIRT1 activity toward nascent
p53 peptide (data not shown). Allosteric SIRT1 activator
such as STAC-1 has been known to require specific
hydrophobic motifs found in a subset of SIRT1 substrates
including PGC-1α and FOXO3a to facilitate SIRT1
activation [29]. To our knowledge, p53 has no such motifs.
Notably, SRT1720 was reported to reduce acetyl-p53 in
cells [22], in spite of it could not activate in vitro SIRT1
activity toward nascent p53 peptide [28]. How YK-3-237
activates SIRT1 to remove acetyl group from mtp53 in
cells needs to be determined in the future.
As we demonstrated, YK-3-237 also activated the in
vitro enzyme activity of human SIRT2. Additionally, YK3-237 reduced the acetyl-α-tubulin (K40) and the level
of α-tubulin in cells. Because YK-3-237 was determined
not to bind tubulin binding sites in vitro [31], it is less
plausible that YK-3-237 exerts its anti-proliferative effect
through inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Rather
decrease of α-tubulin through deacetylation by SIRT2
may contribute G2/M arrest in a cooperative manner with
depletion of mtp53.
In summary, we demonstrated YK-3-237 is a
small molecule activator of SIRT1. Activation of SIRT1
by YK-3-237 functionally reduces the level of mtp53
by deacetylation. The roles of SIRT1 in human cancers
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are controversial [18,19] and both SIRT1 inhibitors and
activators (such as resveratrol) have been reported to
inhibit growth of human cancer cell lines [19]. Although
several SIRT1 activating compounds have been recently
developed [20-23], the anti-cancer effects of these
compounds have not been reported. Because SIRT1 has
a deacetylase activity against broad range of substrates
acting as either tumor promoters or tumor suppressors
[18,19], activating its enzyme activity may be beneficial
for certain subtypes of cancers. Given increasing interests
of SIRT1 in many biological processes including cancer,
aging, diabetes, and neuronal diseases, YK-3-237
may represent a valuable tool for basic research and
pharmaceutical development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
The SUM149PT and SUM1315MO2 cell lines were
purchased from Asterand (Detroit, MI) and maintained
as recommended. All other cell lines were obtained from
American Type Cell Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) or

Cell viability was measured by MTT assay as
described previously [49]. In brief, cells were counted by
the Luna Automated Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems,
Gyunggi-Do, Korea) and subcultured in 96-well
plates. The day after subculture, cells were treated with
increasing amount of YK-3-237 and further incubated
for ~72 hr in triplicate. To measure the viable cells, 20
µl of 5 mg/ml MTT solution was added per 100 µl of
growth media. After 2-4 hr incubation at 37°C, the media
were removed and 150 µl/well of DMSO was added to
dissolve the formazan. The absorbance was measured by

in 6-well plates with density of 0.6~1 x 105 cells/well.
The day after subculture, 100 nM/well of siRNA was
transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen)
in serum free media. Four hours after transfection, equal
volume of normal growth media was added to each well
and the cells were further incubated for 3-days. The
siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette,
CO) with following sequences: control-siRNA,
5’-GACGAGCGGCACGUGCACAUU-3’;
SIRT1siRNA, 5’-CCACCUGAGUUGGAUGAUA-3’; p53siRNA, 5’-GAC UCC AGU GGU AAU CUA CUU-3’.

Cells were treated with either DMSO or 1 µM of
YK-3-237 for 24 hr. The attached cells were harvested
by trypsinization and combined with floating cells
in the culture media. After washing by phosphatebuffered saline, the cells were fixed with 70% ethanol at
-20˚C. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, CA) at
the Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Shared Resource at
Georgetown University Medical Center.

Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis

In vitro SIRT assay

qRT-PCR was performed as described previously
[50] with an Applied Biosystems-Prism Sequence
Detector System 7700 at the Genomics and Epigenomics
Shared Resource of Georgetown University Medical
Center. The primers were used with following sequences:
PUMA: forward, 5´-GAC CTC AAC GCA CAG TAC3´ and reverse, 5´-GCA TCT CCG TCA GTG CAC-3´;
NOXA: forward, 5´-TCC GGC AGA AAC TTC TGA
AT-3 and reverse, 5´-TTC CAT CTT CCG TTT CCA AG3´ ; GAPDH: forward, 5’-GTA TGA CAA CGA ATT TGG
CTA CAG-3’ and reverse, 5’-AGC ACA GGG TAC TTT
ATT GAT GGT-3’.

The Fluor-de-Lys-SIRT1 and SIRT2 deacetylase
assay were performed as manufacturer’s instruction (Enzo
Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY). For competition assay,
50 µM of suramin was added to reaction.

p53 reporter gene assay
Plasmid DNAs for reporter gene assay were
obtained from following sources: SIRT1 and DN-SIRT1
from Addgene (Cambridge, MA); Expression vector
for WTp53 from Dr. B. Vogelstein; and p53-Luc from
Promega (Madison, WI). MCF7 cells were transfected
with p53-Luc reporter plasmid with expression vector for
WTp53 in the presence or absence of SIRT1 expression
vector by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four
hour after transfection, the cells were further treated with
YK-3-237 for 24 hr and luciferase activity was measured
according to manufacturer’s instruction (Promega) using
Victor2 plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA)
at the Genomics and Epigenomics Shared Resource of
Georgetown University Medical Center and normalized
to β-galactosidase activities.

Statistical analysis
To compare two groups of interest, the two-tailed
Student’s t-test was applied for statistical analysis. *
indicates P < 0.05; ** indicates P < 0.01; and *** indicates
P < 0.001.

Conflict of Interest
Patent applications have been filed by Georgetown
University on the behalf of the inventors that are listed as
authors in this work.

Western blot analysis and antibodies
Preparation of cell lysates and western blot analyses
were performed as described previously [49]. Antibodies
were obtained from the following sources: Ac-p53 (K382;
#2525), Ac-α-tubulin (K40; #3971), phospho-ACC (S78;
#3661), and ACC (#3676) from Cell Signaling (Danvers,
