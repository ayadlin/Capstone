Abstract
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mediates cancer cell invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance,
but its impact on immune surveillance has not been explored. In this study, we investigated the functional
consequences of this mode of epithelial cell plasticity on targeted cell lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).
Acquisition of the EMT phenotype in various derivatives of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells was associated with
dramatic morphologic changes and actin cytoskeleton remodeling, with CD24/CD44þ/ALDHþ stem cell populations present exhibiting a higher degree of EMT relative to parental cells. Strikingly, acquisition of this phenotype also associated with an inhibition of CTL-mediated tumor cell lysis. Resistant cells exhibited attenuation
in the formation of an immunologic synapse with CTLs along with the induction of autophagy in the target cells.
This response was critical for susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis because siRNA-mediated silencing of beclin1
to inhibit autophagy in target cells restored their susceptibility to CTL-induced lysis. Our results argue that in
addition to promoting invasion and metastasis EMT also profoundly alters the susceptibility of cancer cells to
T-cell–mediated immune surveillance. Furthermore, they reveal EMT and autophagy as conceptual realms for
immunotherapeutic strategies to block immune escape. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2418–27. 2013 AACR.

system is often inefﬁcient (2), which accounts for the disappointing clinical activity of most cancer vaccines (3). Extensive
studies have shown that tumor cells themselves play a crucial
role in modulating the host immune response, such that they
maintain their functional disorder and evade immune surveillance (4). In this regard, it has been suggested that tumor cell
growth in vivo is not only inﬂuenced by cytotoxic T lymphocyte
(CTL) tumor cell recognition but also by tumor susceptibility
to cell-mediated death (5). While the resistance of tumor cells
to T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity remains a major impediment
for cancer immunotherapy, its molecular basis is poorly
understood.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental mechanism governing embryonic morphogenesis that has,
intriguingly, been documented to operate in carcinomas, with
the transition from an epithelial carcinoma to a mesenchymallike state potentially linked with increased stemness, therapeutic resistance, and escape from immune surveillance (6).
Snail 1 (SNAI1) is a transcription factor that induces EMT by
directly repressing E-cadherin expression (7). We previously
described the morphologic changes in lung cell carcinoma as a
mechanism of tumor escape that was partly involved in the
resistance of tumor cells to T-cell–mediated cytotoxicity (8).
Recently, autophagy has been proposed to play an important
role in tumor progression and in the promotion of cancer cell
death (9). Furthermore, it is shown that EMT involves the
activation of several important pathways that help tumors

survive and evolve into highly invasive and metastatic variants
(10). However, the relationship between EMT and autophagyinduced cell survival is unknown. Although evidence has
suggested that epithelial plasticity may interfere with tumor
susceptibility to cytotoxic agents, the functional consequences
of EMT on T-cell–mediated cytotoxicity remain undetermined.
In this study, we sought to examine the inﬂuence of EMT on
CTL-mediated lysis and its associated mechanisms and to
ascertain whether EMT-induced cell plasticity could interfere
with tumor cell susceptibility to this lysis. We show that EMT
has functional consequences on target recognition and lysis,
and we identify EMT-induced autophagy as a novel mechanism
by which tumor cells regulate CTL reactivity and impede their
cytotoxic activity.

Materials and Methods
T-cell clone, tumor cell lines, and culture conditions
The T-cell receptor (TCR)-Vb13.6þ Heu33 CTL clone was
derived from a patient's Heu tumor as described (11). MCF-7
and derivatives were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Media (DMEM):F12 medium supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Gibco-BRL), 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line
was transfected with wild-type Snail (SNAI1), constitutively
activated Snail (SNAI1-6SA) generated by mutation of Ser6 to
Ala and with an empty vector, as described (12). Transfected
cells were cultured in complete medium supplemented with
500 mg/mL of G418 (Life Technologies). TNF-resistant cells
(2101) were derived from the TNF-sensitive human breast
carcinoma MCF-7 cell line after continuous exposure to
increasing doses of recombinant TNF-a (13).

in blocking buffer, the membranes were probed overnight at
4 C with the primary antibodies. The labeling was visualized
using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and with
an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primary antibodies against SNAI1, E-cadherin and LC3B were from Cell
Signaling. Antibodies against SNAI2 and Twist were from
Abcam. Antibodies against vimentin, beclin 1, and N-cadherin
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies.
Data preprocessing of the breast cancer cell line panel
Two large breast cancer cell line datasets were established
using the Affymetrix U133A or U133plus2 platform: E-TABM157 (n ¼ 51 samples corresponding to 51 cell lines) and
GSE15026 (n ¼ 30 samples corresponding to 19 cell lines)
were downloaded from Array Express and Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO), respectively. Robust Multichip Average
(RMA) normalization was conducted for each dataset. The
normalized data were combined with the dataset from the
present study (n ¼ 8 samples from the parental MCF-7 cells, 2
Snail-expressing cell lines, and one TNF-a–resistant MCF cell
line variant), and subsequently standardized using ComBat
(14) to remove batch effect. The standardized data yielded a
dataset of 89 samples derived from 73 cell lines.

Cell morphology, actin cytoskeleton, and EMT marker
staining
Cell morphology images were acquired using 20 objective
by phase-contrast microscopy (Leica Microsystems). Actin
ﬁlaments were stained by Alexa Fluor 488–coupled Phalloidin.
EMT markers were stained with indicated antibodies and
nuclei with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; dihydrochloride; Life Technologies). Cells were cultured in IBIDI
chambers (IBIDI) and ﬁxed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20
minutes at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized
with 0.4% Triton X-100 and stained with indicated antibodies.
Cells were analyzed with a Zeiss laser scanning confocal
microscope, LSM-510 Meta (Carl Zeiss) and processed by LSM
Image Examiner software (Carl Zeiss).

Estimation of EMT score
An EMT scoring method was developed using ovarian
carcinoma cell line expression proﬁling. The ﬁrst step was to
establish an EMT signature comparing proﬁles of CDH1- with
CDH2-expressing cell lines using a binary regression method
(BinReg; ref. 15). In the second step, the BinReg ovarian cancer
EMT signature was applied to breast cancer cell lines to predict
their EMT status. In the third step, the top 25% (20 samples)
with the highest probabilities for the epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype were used to obtain epithelial- or mesenchymal-speciﬁc gene lists for the breast cancer cell lines using
Signiﬁcance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) q value of 0 and
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) value of 0.85. In the
fourth step, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA; ref. 16) was used to compute the enrichment score
of a cell line based on the expression of the breast cancer cell
line–speciﬁc epithelial or mesenchymal signature genes. EMT
score is deﬁned as the normalized subtraction of the mesenchymal from epithelial enrichment score. The EMT score is
a precise estimate of the cell line's status as an epithelial or
mesenchymal phenotype. A higher or lower EMT score indicates that the cell line exhibits a more mesenchymal or
epithelial phenotype, respectively (the detailed method is
submitted for publication, Tan, Huang, Thiery and Mori and
colleagues).

Western blotting
Adherent cells were lysed on the plate with lysis buffer (62.5
mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride, 25 mmol/L leupeptin, 5 mmol/L benzamidine, 1 mmol/L
pepstatin, and 25 mmol/L aprotinin). Cells lysates were
resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (30 mg/sample) and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation

Cytotoxicity experiments and TNF-b production assay
The cytotoxic activity of the CTL clone was measured by a
conventional 4-hour 51Cr release assay. Several effector:target
(E:T) ratios were used on 1,000 target cells per well. Supernatants were then transferred to LumaPlate-96 wells (PerkinElmer), dried down, and counted on a Packard TopCount
NXT. Percentage of speciﬁc cytotoxicity was calculated
conventionally.

TNF-b release was detected by measuring the cytotoxicity of
the culture supernatants on the TNF-sensitive WEHI-164c13
cells with an MTT colorimetric assay, as previously described
(17).
Confocal microscopy analysis of immunologic synapse
assembly
Tumor cells and CTLs were cocultured for 30 minutes at a 1:2
ratio. Cells were then ﬁxed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10
minutes and permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) SDS solution in
PBS for 10 minutes, followed by blocking with FCS 10% (v/v)
solution in PBS for 20 minutes. Fixed cells were stained with an
anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4G10 clone
(dilution 1:100, Millipore Corp.) and then with a secondary
mAb coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes.
Cell nuclei were stained with TO-Pro 3 iodide (2 mmol/L) for
15 minutes. Analysis was conducted by a Zeiss laser scanning
confocal microscope (LSM-510) and using LSM Image Examiner software (Zeiss). Conjugates formed between T cells and
tumor cells were scored by visual counting. Mean number of
active synapses/ﬁeld were counted in 10 different ﬁelds per cell
line randomly selected at 40 magniﬁcations. Quantiﬁcation
of phosphotyrosine intensity was conducted using the region
measurement function of ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda,
MD).
Autophagosome detection and autophagy ﬂux analysis
Cells were transiently transfected with 5 mg of LC3 cDNA
fused with GFP (kindly provided by N. Mizuchima, Tokyo
Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. After 48 hours, cells were cultured in IBIDI
chambers (Biovalley), and the formation of autophagosomes
was assessed by Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscopy
LSM-510 Meta. The autophagy ﬂux was assessed by treatment
of cells for 6 hours with chloroquine (40 mmol/L), an inhibitor
of the lysosomal activity, and the accumulation of the lipidated
form of LC3 (LC3-II) was analyzed by Western blotting using an
anti-LC3 Ab.
Immunohistochemical staining for Snail 2 and ATG5
expression
Mesenchymal and autophagic cells, respectively, were
detected by SNAI2 and ATG5 staining on human breast
cancer sections. Immunohistochemistry was conducted as
previously described (18). The samples were incubated with
mAbs against SNAI2 (Abcam) and ATG5 (MBL Japan). The
signal was revealed with the DAB HistoMouse-Max Kit
(Zymed Laboratories Inc.).
siRNA targeting of autophagy gene BECN1
Autophagy-defective cells were generated by transfection
with beclin1 (BECN1) siRNA. Brieﬂy, cells were transfected
by electroporation with 50 nmol of siRNA-targeting human
beclin1 (Qiagen). Luciferase (Luc) siRNA was used as a
negative control. The silencing of beclin1 was assessed by
Western blotting 48 hours after transfection using appropriate antibodies.

Data mining of microarray results
Signiﬁcantly regulated genes in SNAI1 or SNAI1-6SA transfectants as compared with the parental MCF-7 cells were
subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The Ingenuity
database was used to identify EMT-regulated genes, whereas
the dedicated autophagy database was used to extract genes
involved in and/or related to the autophagic process (19, 20).
IPA software was used to build a connection between EMT and
the autophagy-regulated genes.
RNA isolation and SYBR green real-time quantitative
PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the samples using TRIzol
(Invitrogen). A total of 1 mg RNA was converted into cDNA by
using Taqman Reverse transcription reagent (Applied Biosystems), and mRNA levels were quantiﬁed by SYBR-GREEN qPCR
method (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression was calculated by using the comparative CT method (2DCT).
Flow cytometry and ALDH activity
Cells were harvested with 0.025% EDTA and double-stained
with CD44 (PE) and CD24 (APC) mAbs (both from Miltenyi
Biotec). Labeled cells were analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur (BD
Biosciences).
ALDH activity was analyzed using the Aldeﬂuor Assay Kit
from StemCell Technologies, Inc. and following manufacturer's
recommendations.
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism. The Student t test
was used for single comparisons. Data were considered statistically signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.

Results and Discussion
2101, SNAI1, and SNAI1-6SA cells display similar EMT
phenotypes, but distinct EMT indicies and stemness
markers
We characterized the EMT phenotype of MCF-7–derived
cells that have undergone EMT following the overexpression of
either wild-type Snail (SNAI1) or constitutively active Snail
(SNAI1-6SA) or following the acquisition of TNF-a resistance
(2101 cells). Parental MCF-7 cells exhibited a characteristic
cobblestone epithelial organization with E-cadherin, b-catenin, and ZO-1 immunolocalization at cell–cell contacts that
were also closely associated with cortical actin microﬁlaments.
MCF-7 cells also expressed cytokeratin intermediate ﬁlaments,
some of which were localized at sites of desmosomes. In
contrast, SNAI1 and SNAI1-6SA cells displayed a spindle-like
morphology with ﬁlopodia and were characterized by reduced
cell–cell contacts (Fig. 1A). 2101 cells exhibited an even more
extensive mesenchymal phenotype with actin microﬁlaments
in the ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia (Fig. 1A). Immunoﬂuorescence analysis showed a dramatic downregulation of the
epithelial markers E-cadherin, b-catenin, ZO-1, and cytokeratin 18 in the MCF-7–derived cell lines undergoing EMT (Fig.
1A). These morphologic changes were also associated with a
gain of mesenchymal markers. Indeed, SNAI1 transfection

induced the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin and
decreased the expression of E-cadherin. SNAI1-6SA cells
expressed SNAI2, ZEB1, but not E-cadherin (Fig. 1B). Thus,
constitutively activated SNAI1-6SA cells are likely to exhibit a
more pronounced mesenchymal-like phenotype than SNAI1
cells. Figure 1B also shows that 2101 cells exhibited a more
complete EMT phenotype, with the expression of SNAI2, Twist,
ZEB1, vimentin, and N-cadherin.
To provide further evidence for the EMT features of these
cancer cell lines, we developed an EMT scoring method using
gene expression proﬁling. As shown in Fig. 2A, an EMT score of
0.84  0.008 was determined for the parental MCF-7 cells,
indicating its well-known epithelial phenotype. As expected,
SNAI1 cells acquired a mesenchymal-like phenotype; but the
EMT score of 0.16  0.007 instead indicated an intermediate
phenotype. Similarly, the SNAI1-6SA cells were found to have
an EMT score of 0.11  0.01. In contrast, the 2101 cells scored
a signiﬁcantly higher 0.6  0.02, which cannot be fully related to
the Snail signature (60% concordance, data not shown) as
other signatures, such as ZEB1, could contribute to this EMT
score. This result suggests that 2101 cells acquire EMT by
additional mechanisms that involve 2 or more transcriptional
repressors of E-cadherin. It is worth noting that the acquisition of a resistance to TNF-a and the high EMT score in
these 2101 cells suggest the existence of a level of complexity
in the EMT process in which multiple molecules act together
to mediate EMT, rather than the master regulators acting on
their own. This indicates that EMT can be induced to varying
degrees in epithelial cells to acquire intermediate mesenchymal-like states but also to display additional functional
features. In this regard, Kim and colleagues have recently
reported that p53 regulates EMT through miRNAs targeting
ZEB1 and ZEB2 (21). It should be noted that 2101 cells display
a mutated p53 and a loss of its transcriptional activity (13),
which may, at least in part, account for the acquisition of EMT
by these cells.
On the basis of the previously reported induction of stem cell
markers following induction of EMT (22), we next determined
the relationship between EMT score and stem cell characteristics such as CD44high/CD24low proﬁle and high ALDH activity.
As shown in Fig. 2B, a, 2101 cells were equally partitioned into a
CD44high and a CD44/low populations as compared with MCF7 cells, which displayed only a CD44 proﬁle. Furthermore,
measurements of ALDH activity showed a spectrum of high
ALDH activity, with levels increasing in parallel to the
estimated EMT score in MCF-7, SNAI1, SNAI1-6SA, and
2101 cells (Fig. 2B, b). Indeed, Fig. 2B(ii) shows that 2101
cells harbored the highest level of ALDH activity (92%
ALDHþ) and MCF-7 cells the lowest (56% ALDHþ). Additional experiments showed an increased exclusion of the
Hoechst dye, an increased expression of the stem cell
markers SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, as well as spheroid formation
and tumorigenicity in EMTed subclones (Supplementary
Data S1). Consistent with these results, ZEB1 has been
reported to link EMT activation and maintenance of stemness by suppressing stemness-inhibiting miRNAs (23). These
results suggest that our EMTed clone exhibit stem cell–like
properties.

Impairment of tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated
lysis upon EMT
To examine the functional consequences of target cell
plasticity on speciﬁc T-cell–mediated lysis, we used the Heu33
CTL clone, which is able to lyse the parental MCF-7 cell line in
an HLA-A2–restricted manner (11). As shown in Fig. 3A, a
signiﬁcant decrease in EMTed target cell susceptibility to CTLmediated killing was observed. To determine whether
impairment of T-cell–mediated lysis correlated with defects in
recognition of Snail1-expressing cells, we examined conjugate
formation between Heu33 CTL and MCF-7 cells or their derivative clones by confocal microscopy. The results shown in Fig.
3B, a indicate that MCF-7 parental cells were able to form stable
conjugates with the Heu33 clone and could induce T-cell
activation, as shown by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation
at the cell contact area. In contrast, a signiﬁcant decrease of
phosphotyrosine staining was detected when the CTL clone was
cultured with mesenchymal cells (2101, SNAI1, and SNAI1-6SA),
as conﬁrmed by statistical analysis (Fig. 3B, b). The decrease in
phosphotyrosine accumulation at the contact zone formed
between mesenchymal and CD8þ T cells reveals an alteration
in the signaling events occurring at the immune synapse that
may be potentially due to the expression of Snail. When
reported as the percentage of active conjugates, a signiﬁcant
decrease in conjugates with phosphotyrosine accumulation
was observed between the mesenchymal cells and CD8þ T
lymphocytes as compared with those observed between parental MCF-7 cell line and CTLs (Fig. 3B, c). As shown in Fig. 3C,
mesenchymal tumor cells were less efﬁcient in triggering
cytokine production by CTL clone, indicating an inﬂuence of
the EMT phenotype acquisition on T-cell reactivity.
Despite our increasing knowledge about tumor escape
mechanisms, the involvement of EMT in tumor resistance to
CTL-mediated killing and, in particular, how it counteracts
effector T-cell responses has not been well documented. Here,
we provide evidence that the acquisition of an EMTed phenotype results in the inhibition of target cell susceptibility to
TCR-dependent lysis. In a previous study, we showed that
resistance may be associated with morphologic changes (8).
Our ﬁndings conﬁrm that understanding the tumor behavior,
especially in the context of tumor cell plasticity, and its
interplay with effector cells will be key determinants in
providing a rational approach to tumor immunotherapy.
Accordingly, the various strategies aimed at the induction of
antitumor cytotoxic responses should therefore consider the
morphologic changes described in this report as an antitumor
mechanism of tumor escape that is partly involved in resistance of cancer cells to CTL-mediated cytotoxicity.
EMT-induced tumor cell resistance to CTL-mediated
lysis involves the induction of autophagy
We next asked whether EMT-dependent impairment of
target cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing is associated
with the activation of autophagy. Cells were transfected with
GFP-LC3 to monitor the formation of autophagosomes. While
no autophagosomes were detected in parental and control
MCF-7 (MCF-7 and MCF-7 empty vector), the formation of
autophagosomes (green dot–like structures) was observed in

that, in the absence of chloroquine, there was an increase in

both LC3-I and -II in the EMTed cells, suggesting autophagy
induction in these cells. When mesenchymal cells were treated
with chloroquine, there was an accumulation of LC3-II. Taken
together, these data provide compelling evidence that autophagy ﬂux is activated in cells undergoing EMT.

Interestingly, the expression of the autophagy marker ATG5
was detected in human breast cancer tissues expressing the
EMT marker SNAI2 (Fig. 4C, a and b). This ﬁgure shows clearly
that ATG5 is localized in SNAI2-positive areas of tumors. As
shown in Supplementary Data S5, the result of co-expression of
EMT and autophagy markers in human breast cancer tissues
was conﬁrmed using another autophagy marker (LC3B). These
ﬁndings suggest that EMT and autophagy markers co-express
in human breast cancer tissues.
Inhibition of autophagy by targeting beclin1 (Fig. 5A, a)
sensitized mesenchymal tumor cells to CTL-mediated killing
(Fig. 5A, b), which suggests that the process of EMT activates
autophagy-dependent mechanisms to maintain tumor cell

resistance to CTL. As EMTed ALDHþ-sorted cells were more
resistant to the CTL-induced cell lysis (Supplementary Data
S2), we suggest that the induction of autophagy and stem-like
properties by the EMT program is critically important for the
emergence of tumor cell resistant variants.
Data mining analysis was conducted to provide insight on
how EMT regulates autophagy. Gene array results showed that
the majority of autophagy core machinery genes (ATG) were
not regulated at the transcriptomic level in Snail-expressing
cells. BECN1 (ATG6) is the only ATG gene that was found to
be signiﬁcantly upregulated in 2101, SNAI1, and SNAI1-6SA, by
approximately 2-fold. This supports the notion previously

transcriptional level but mainly regulated by 3 types of posttranslational modiﬁcations (phosphorylation, ubiquitylation,
and acetylation; reviewed in ref. 24). As no transcriptional
regulation of ATG genes involved in the core autophagy
machinery was observed, we devoted more attention to the
genes involved in the regulation of autophagy and thus identiﬁed DAPK1, PTEN, and CDKN2A. While the involvement of
DAPK1 in the induction of autophagy is now well documented,
PTEN and CDKN2A genes can regulate several cell functions,
including cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy. Although much
remains to be learned mechanistically, our result discloses for
the ﬁrst time a functional link between EMT and autophagy via

investigations.
In conclusion, these data indicate that the acquisition of an
EMT phenotype is an additional immune escape mechanism in
tumor cells. Of interest, cells undergoing EMT acquired resistance to CTL-induced cell death, which reveals an insight into
the signiﬁcance of tumor cell plasticity and tumor resistance
pathways. More importantly, the present work shows a relationship between EMT, autophagy, stem-like characteristics,
and resistance of cancer cells to CTL-induced killing. This is the
ﬁrst report, using expression proﬁling, to show the molecular
link between EMT and autophagy in cells displaying an EMT

phenotype. The in-depth analysis of the precise contribution of
EMT transcription factors in autophagy regulation and how
this homeostatic process is mechanistically linked to the
maintenance of breast stem cell marker expression in tumor
cells may improve our understanding of the relationship
between EMT and tumor resistance to immune surveillance.
These results indicate that reversing EMT to avoid immune
resistance may represent a promising treatment strategy.
Unraveling autophagy, a pharmacologically targeted mechanism, as an EMT-induced process could help to sensitize
resistant EMTed cells to immunotherapy approaches.
