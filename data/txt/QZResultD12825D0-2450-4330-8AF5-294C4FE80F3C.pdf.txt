ABSTRACT
Inflammation is a double-edged sword with both detrimental and beneficial
consequences. Understanding of the mechanisms of crosstalk between the
inflammatory milieu and human adult mesenchymal stem cells is an important basis
for clinical efforts. Here, we investigate changes in the transcriptional response of
human adipose-derived stem cells to physiologically relevant levels of IL-2 (IL-2
priming) upon replicative senescence. Our data suggest that replicative senescence
might dramatically impede human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) function via global
transcriptional deregulation in response to IL-2. We uncovered a novel senescenceassociated transcriptional signature in human adipose-derived MSCs hADSCs after
exposure to pro-inflammatory environment: significant enhancement of the expression
of the genes encoding potent growth factors and cytokines with anti-inflammatory
and migration-promoting properties, as well as genes encoding angiogenic and antiapoptotic promoting factors, all of which could participate in the establishment of
a unique microenvironment. We observed transcriptional up-regulation of critical
components of the nitric oxide synthase pathway (iNOS) in hADSCs upon replicative
senescence suggesting, that senescent stem cells can acquire metastasis-promoting
properties via stem cell-mediated immunosuppression. Our study highlights
the importance of age as a factor when designing cell-based or pharmacological
therapies for older patients and predicts measurable biomarkers characteristic of an
environment that is conducive to cancer cells invasiveness and metastasis.

adaptive and innate immunity by the secretion of growth
factors and chemokines to induce cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, interactions with the immune system and
mediation of anti-apoptotic events [1, 2]. Based on these
remarkable properties, the MSCs are considered to have
therapeutic potential to treat broad spectrum of diverse
human diseases, including cancer [3].
The most favorable way of using the full potential
of MSCs as a therapeutic is the clinical utilization of
autologous (patient specific) or syngeneic (genetically
similar) cells. To date, little is known regarding the extent
to which the beneficial properties of MSC change with the
age of the patient or upon MSCs expansion and passaging
ex-vivo, where the length of expansion period, culture
methods and the patient’s clinical history can all lead to
a gradual accumulation of replicatively senescent cells.
Replicative senescence is characterized by a growth arrest,
apoptosis resistance, morphological and cell-size changes,
high levels of expression of the tumor suppressors P16,
P21, P53 and/or RB, increased activity of senescenceassociated beta galactosidase (SA-β-gal) and loss of the
ability to synthesize and repair DNA [4, 5]. Numerous
reports indicate that the replicative aging of stem cells
and MSCs, in particular, can influence their biological
properties, including their ability to secrete beneficial
factors [6-9].
The primary trophic property of MSCs is secretion
of mitogenic growth factors such as transforming growth
factor-alpha (TGF-α), TGF-β, hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), epithelial growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast
growth factor (FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). All of
these factors, when present in the systemic milieu, have
shown to increase fibroblasts along with epithelial and
endothelial cell division or differentiation [3, 10-13].
This provides evidence that the MSC-triggered cellular
communication circuitry is necessary for tissue or organ
remodeling and regeneration. Interestingly, the secretion
of a wide array of growth factor and anti-inflammatory
proteins by MSCs could also be modulated in response
to inflammatory molecules, such as interlukin-1 (IL1), IL-2, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)
and interferon-gamma (INF-γ) (see for review [3]),
thereby providing complex signaling guidance to many
inflammatory cells, including T-cells, natural killer
cell, B-cells, monocytes, macrophages and endritic
cells [3, 14-17]. Previous reports have demonstrated
that pro-inflammatory cytokines were able to increase
the migration of human MSCs as well as to induce the
production of chemokines and chemotactic factors that
permit MSCs to suppress immune reactions [18-20]. The
best documented immune-modulatory effect of MSCs is
their ability to impose G0/G1 phase arrest in the activated
T-cells, thus inhibiting T-cell proliferation [19, 20] [21,
22]. Despite the notion that the secretion by MSCs of a
number of the soluble factors (IL-6, IL-10, indoleamine,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

2,3-dioxygenase, iNOS and PGE2) could assist injury
through the modulation of the regenerative environment
via anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory pathways,
the exact molecular mechanism by which this modulation
takes place is only partially understood and seemingly
contradictive, in part due to lack of data that clearly
articulates how adult stem cell aging in-vivo or ex-vivo
contributes to immunomodulatory properties.
This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of
replicative senescence on the transcriptional activity of
human adipose-derived MSCs (hADSCs) in response to
IL-2 signaling. Our results uncovered significant changes
imposed by replicative senescence on biological pathways
related to stem cell response to IL-2 priming, and suggest
that such changes might dramatically influence outcomes
of clinical application of hADSCs by affecting their
immunomodulatory and migration properties as well as
their ability to influence the regenerative environment.

RESULTS
Characterization of the MSC senescent phenotype
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are mesodermderived cells that reside in the stroma of solid organs and
function as precursors of non-hematopoietic connective
tissues with the capacity to differentiate into mesenchymal
and non-mesenchymal cell lineages. Adipose-derived
MSCs (ADSCs) are more accessible, compared to bone
marrow BM-MSCs, more abundant, and equally capable of
differentiating into cells and tissues of mesodermal origin
[23]. ADSCs also share some of the immunomodulatory
properties that characterize BM-MSCs. Reported data
indicate that ADSCs could effectively down-regulate
excessive immunologic reactions and have a protective
effect on acute graft-versus-host disease, as well as in
animal models of experimental arthritis [24, 25]. hADSCs
were isolated and cultured as described in the Materials
and Methods and in [7]. Ex-vivo replicative senescence
led to decreased proliferation, accumulation of DNA
damage and observed typical morphological changes:
hADSCs became much larger with irregular and flat shape,
and nuclei became more circumscribed in phase contrast
microscopy with the granular cytoplasm appearance of
many inclusions and aggradations [6, 7]. The growth
curves of hADSCs obtained from two different patients
are shown in Figure 1A. Typical staining for senescenceassociated SA-β galactosidase activity for either hADSCs
in linear growth rate, self-renewing state (SR) or when
cell lines cease their proliferation, senescent state (SEN) is
shown in Figure 1B and described in detail in [7].

previously reported as potent chemo-attractants inducing
migration of different stem cell types [27, 28]. Our data
indicate that hADSCs at late passages have an increased
ability to migrate in comparison to early passages (Figure
1D), indicating that replicative senescence increases
the migratory properties of hADSCs in response to the
tested chemo-attractants. Interestingly, upon senescence
of hADSCs interleukin-2 (IL-2) became the most potent
chemo-taxis stimulant whereas the TNF-α is less potent
among the tested chemo-attractants in these experiments
(Figure 1D).
Collectively, these data indicate that replicative
senescence can modify the migratory properties of
hADSCs and may possibly influence hADSCs response
to the inflammatory environment as well as their
immunomodulation output ex-vivo.

abundant than the IL2Rβ isoform (compare 120 pg/ml of
IL2Rα and 350 pg/ml IL2Rβ to 150 pg/ml of IL2Rα and
440 pg/ml IL2Rβ upon replicative senescence ex-vivo)
as shown in Figure 2C. These data suggest that hADSCs
response to IL-2 stimulation occurs, by and large, through
the intermediate-affinity receptor dimer composed of
IL2Rβ (CD122) and the common IL2Rγ (CD132). These
data also caution against over-interpretation of receptorsignaling pathway dynamics based on transcriptional
assays only.
IL-2 signals via JAK1 and JAK3 to activate
STAT5A and STAT5B, and additionally uses Ras-MAP
kinase and phosphoinositol 3-kinase dependent signaling
pathways (Figure 2A) [33, 34]. The expression of
downstream target of IL-2, STAT5, is shown in Figure
3A and 3B and Supplementary Table 1. In hADSCs, both
STAT5A and STAT5B gene transcription follows the IL-2/
STAT5 signaling axis previously described for T-cells (for
review see [35]), thus prompting us to investigate in detail
how IL-2 and its downstream target STAT5 may effect
transcriptional outcomes in hADSCs upon their replicative
senescence ex-vivo.

Differential response to IL-2 stimulation in
human adipose-derived MSCs upon replicative
senescence
IL-2 is a ligand used by cells expressing either the
intermediate-affinity receptor dimer of IL2Rβ (CD122)
and the common IL2Rγ (CD132), or the high-affinity
trimeric IL2R comprising IL2Rα (CD25) in addition to
the IL2Rβ and IL2Rγ isoforms (shown in Figure 2A).
The intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor is more broadly
expressed on T-cells, natural killer cells and monocytes
[29]. The high-affinity IL-2 receptor is constitutively
expressed on regulatory T-cells (Treg). Information about
the role of IL-2 signaling in non-T-cells is limited, but
nevertheless suggests the existence of similar stimulatory
receptor representations in other cell types [30-32].
Currently, it is unknown how hADSCs are affected by
therapeutic doses of IL-2, and whether or not there are
changes that occur in IL-2 receptor composition or IL-2
receptor signaling upon ex-vivo replicative senescence of
this type of human MSCs.
Assessment of the IL-2 receptor isoforms expression
by qPCR demonstrated dramatic changes in expression of
the IL2Rα isoform in comparison to IL2Rγ and IL2Rβ upon
replicative senescence ex-vivo (Figure 2B). Notably, the
increased accumulation of the IL2Rβ and IL2Rγ transcripts
was recorded after IL-2 treatment in both SR and SEN
hADSCs, whereas IL2Rα expression was severely
abrogated when senescent cells were subjected to similar
treatments (Figure 2B). However, our data indicate that on
the protein level, the cellular membrane-associated IL2Rα
receptor shows the opposite pattern (Figure 2C). Although
the transcriptional status of IL-2 receptor isoforms does
vary between the two different cell states (SR and SEN),
it does not seem to be dependent upon IL-2 priming as
measured by the ELISA assay (described in the Materials
and Methods). Interestingly, our data also demonstrate
that protein encoding IL-2 receptor α chain is far less

Priming with IL-2 results in altered gene
expression in human ADSCs upon replicative
senescence
To address how the transcriptional response to
the IL-2/STAT5 axis changes upon replicative aging of
hADSCs ex-vivo, we performed RNA-seq transcriptome
analysis using the Ion ProtonTM System as described in the
Material and Methods and shown in Supplementary Figure
1A. We compared gene expression levels in hADSCs
across four conditions (libraries): self-renewal upon
normal ex-vivo culture (SR IL-2–), self-renewal upon 24
hrs recombinant IL-2 stimulation (SR IL-2+), replicative
senescence upon normal ex-vivo culture (SEN IL-2–),
and replicative senescence upon 24 hrs recombinant IL-2
stimulation (SEN IL-2+). Distributions of the total read
counts for the four libraries representing each condition
are shown in Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C.
We used beta-actin expression levels to normalize
gene expression levels between conditions (see Materials
and Methods). This approach was taken to allow for the
fact that overall gene expression levels are likely to change
upon IL-2 treatment, and using a global normalization
method to bring the overall expression distributions
for each condition into register would remove this
biological signal. Indeed, beta-actin normalized gene
expression distributions reveal overall up-regulation of
gene expression upon IL-2 treatment in both SR and SEN
states (Supplementary Figure 1D). However, comparison
of individual gene expression levels among the four
conditions suggests that IL-2 treatment more dramatically
affects senescent (SEN) compared to self-renewing

(SR) hADSCs (Figure 4A). The SR IL-2– and SR IL-2+
conditions group closely together when individual gene
expression levels are compared followed by the SEN IL2– condition. The SEN IL-2+ condition is a clear outlier
amongst the four conditions showing a substantially
divergent pattern of individual gene expression levels. This
suggests the possibility that the biological response to IL-2
treatment in hADSCs upon senescence might dramatically
impede MSC function via global transcriptional deregulation in response to IL-2.
Expression levels were further compared between
conditions in order to identify individual genes that are
differentially expressed, up- and down-regulated, in
response to IL-2 treatment in both SR and SEN states
(Figure 4B). There are far more genes that are upregulated (8,866) compared to down-regulated (2,296)
upon IL-2 treatment in both SR and SEN hADSCs. There
is also a substantially higher proportion of genes that
are up-regulated in both SR and SEN hADSCs (35%)
compared to genes that are down-regulated in both states
(4%). The greatest asymmetry is seen for genes that are
down regulated in SEN hADSCs upon IL-2 treatment
(1,739); there are many more such genes than seen for
the SR IL-2+ condition (649). This difference suggests
that the overall divergence of the SEN IL-2+ condition is
largely attributed to genes that are down-regulated upon
IL-2 treatment, which is an unexpected result given the
overall up-regulation across both SR and SEN upon IL-2
treatment (Figure 4B, 4C, 4D and Supplementary Figure
1D).
Taken together, these data suggest the possibility
that SEN hADSCs have lost the ability to generate a
response to IL-2 treatment to the same extent as actively
proliferating cells. The greater number of up-regulated
genes seen for SR IL-2+, compared to SEN IL-2+, is
consistent with this interpretation.

The secretion of a broad range of bioactive
molecules is now believed to be the main mechanism
by which MSCs achieve their therapeutic effects. MSCs
secrete an array of growth factors and anti-inflammatory
proteins with complex feedback mechanisms among
the many types of immune cells [3]. Our data indicate
that the expression of growth factors in hADSCs upon
stimulation with IL-2 is subjected to dramatic changes
upon replicative senescence ex-vivo. While the priming
of actively proliferating (SR) hADSCs with IL-2 results
in increased expression of mitogenic proteins such
as stromal cell-derived factor-2 (SDF2) and SDFL2,
and prostaglandin E synthetase-2 (PTGES2), both SR

transforming growth factors alpha and beta (TGFα,
TGFβ1 and TGFβ2), transforming growth factor beta
receptor TGFBR2 and transforming growth factor
beta receptor-associated protein TGFBRAP1, as well
as transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI),
which are known to increase fibroblast, epithelial and
endothelial cell division when secreted in systemic milieu
(Figure 5A and Table S1 ) [3, 36]. In addition, both SR
and SEN IL-2 stimulated hADSCs are marked by upregulation of colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), LIF,
IL-11, IL-17D, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (ligand)
superfamily TNFSF13B, a cytokine encoding gene that
stimulates B- and T-cell function (Figure 5A, 5B and
Supplementary Table1). Taking into account that paracrine
IL-17D induces expression of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF
genes in endothelial cells, and IL-1β stimulates fibroblast
growth factor activity (TGFα, TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 genes
are notably up-regulated in IL-2-primed hADSCs) in
autocrine and paracrine fashion, along with thymocyte
and B-cell proliferation and maturation by inducing
release of IL-2 from these cells, our data suggest that the
transcriptional status of both SR and SEN hADSCs may
point to enhanced immunomodulatory properties of these
cells after IL-2 priming via a complex regulatory feedback loop.
In addition, we also noted essential differences in
the IL-2 dependent expression of growth factors upon
senescence of hADSCs that have not been observed in
SR cells. This includes up-regulation of only a subset of
fibroblast growth factor family members (FGF1, FGF11,
FGF14) accompanied by down-regulation of other
members, such as FGF2, FGF5, FGF7, (Figure 5A and
Supplementary Table1). Surprisingly, IL-2 primed SEN
hADSCs are marked by EGF mRNA up-regulation, but
down-regulation of mRNA to its receptor EGFR, together
with decrease in expression of the serum response factor
SRF and the secreted modulator of WNT signaling
SFRP1. Interestingly, the expression of both a potent
mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin that promotes
wound healing, PDGFA, and its receptor, PDGFRA, is
drastically suppressed in SEN hADSCs in comparison to
SR cells subjected to IL-2 priming (Figure 5A, Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 1).
These data revealed essential senescence-related
differences in the nature of IL-2 mediated transcriptional
response in hADSCs that might impede their
immunomodulatory properties ex-vivo and, ultimately, invivo.

assigned to provide immunomodulatory properties
of hADSCs. Published data indicated that MSCs can
prevent proliferation and promote differentiation of
many inflammatory immune cells, including T-cells,
natural killer cells, B-cells, monocytes, macrophages and
dendritic cells through the secretion of paracrine factors
in response to inflammatory environment [20]. Our data
demonstrate that this capacity for immunomodulation
could be severely affected by replicative aging of the
human adipose-derived MCS during ex-vivo passaging
(Figure 5B) and Supplementary Table 1.
IL-2 priming in SEN hADSCs activates distinct
set of genes attributed to T-cell regulation. IL-2 priming
of self-renewing hADSCs results in up-regulation
of genes, such as TNFRSF21 (involved in T-cells
differentiation), IL12A (T-cell activator), ILF2 (potent
regulator of transcription of the IL-2 gene during T-cell
activation), IL33 (paracrine inducer of T-helper type 2
associated cytokines) and down-regulation of CCL28
(chemotactic factor for CD4+, CD8+ T-cells), CD320
(receptor molecule with autocrine and paracrine function
to augment the proliferation of plasma cells) shown in
Figure 5B and Supplementary Table 1. Contrary to that,
IL-2 primed senescent hADSCs are characterized by
drastic transcriptional up-regulation of CD320, a number
of integrins which could be involved in modulation
of T-cell function (ITG11, ITGAV, ITFG1), and genes
encoding important regulatory molecules such as: the
T-cell adhesion receptor (CD99), a factor attributed to the
maintenance of naïve T-cells (CHST3), T-cell activators
(HIVEP1 and HIVEP2), a gene involved in T-cell
signaling pathway (CMIP) and an autocrine/paracrine
factor, PTGER1, involved in inhibition of CD+ cell
proliferation (Figure 5B and Supplementary Table1). Our
data also demonstrate that SR hADSCs exposed to IL-2
trigger down-regulation of transcriptional activities of the
genes encoding surface receptors that play a role in B-cell
proliferation and differentiation (CD72) and homing
macrophages (CD68). Both of these genes are significantly
transcriptionally up-regulated in senescent cells upon
similar treatment (Figure 5B and Supplementary Table 1).
In addition, IL-2 treated SEN hADSCs are set
apart from similarly treated SR cells by transcriptional
down-regulation of the genes required for pro-B to
pre-B transitioning, the LRRC8A and PEAR1 genes, that
regulate a number of non-adherent myeloid progenitors. In
contrast, the genes involved in lymphocyte activation and
homeostasis (CD83 and TNFRSF25) as well as leukocyte
transmigration (CERCAM), and the genes responsible
for endothelial cell-leukocyte interaction (ESM1), and a
gene important for the control of monocytes/macrophage
mediated immunological process (TNFSF13), are upregulated in SEN hADSCs (Figure 5B and Supplementary
Table 1).

ESM1 (Figure 5D, Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1).
The vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, released
by MCSs enables recruitment of endothelial lineage
cells and initiation of vascularization as was previously
reported [43]. We have further demonstrated that upregulation of VEGFA gene expression in SEN hADSCs
can be detected by quantitative RT-PCR analysis and
IL-2 priming results in a statistically significant increase
of VEGFA gene transcription in SR and SEN hADSCs
(Figure 6). Interestingly, we further observed that in
response to IL-2 priming, a group of genes responsible
for cell motility, migration and invasive growth are
drastically up-regulated only in the hADSCs undergoing
replicative senescence: CGNL1, CGREF1, CRMP1,
FGD6, TNK2, PTGS1, TNFAIP8, CTSB, CTSO, FAP,
FERMT1, PLEKHA1, PLEKHA6, ROCK1, ROCK2. In
concert with this observation, our data indicate that a
set of genes promoting cell adhesion, such as CHD24,
CYR61, ILK, NEDD9, MYL9, PPAP2B, RELN and TLN2
are down-regulated (Figure 5D and Supplementary Table
1). These data further support the experimental evidence
for the enhanced migration capacity of senescent hADSCs
shown in Figure 1C and Figure 1D.
Equally important, IL-2 priming results in the
differential expression of a number of cytokines and
factors critical for chemotaxis (shown in Figure 5B). For
instance, SR hADSCs are marked by up-regulation of
IL-33, IL-12A, IL10RB, IL1RAP, IL7R, ILF2 and NOS3
genes, while IL-16 and CSF1R genes are down-regulated
in these cells. In SEN hADSCs treated under similar
conditions with IL-2, the genes encoding cytokines IL-32,
IL-6, IL1RN, IL20RB, IL21R and inducers of inflammation
TNFSF13 and TNFSF12, as well as the gene encoding
extracellular matrix remodeler PLAU are up-regulated

Another important clinical property of MSCs is the
ability to rescue apoptotic cell death induced by traumatic
exposures to hypoxia, chemicals/acidity, mechanical
damage and radiation. For example, MSCs have been
proven to assist reversal of apoptosis in cardiomyoblasts
after ischemia, as well as damaged neurons and lung
fibroblasts [37,38]. Recently, stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) was
identified as an essential factor capable of potent apoptotic
reversal in fibroblasts damaged by UV and acidity [39].
Our data indicate that IL-2 priming transcriptionally
upregulates both STC1 and STC2 genes, and such
activation is not dependent on the replicative aging of
hADSCs, at least ex-vivo (Supplementary Table1). In
addition, paracrine effectors such as VEGF and TGFβ1
have been implicated in the reversal of apoptosis in
endothelial cells [40]. The expression of genes encoding
both of these factors is up-regulated in SR and SEN
hADSCs upon IL-2 treatment (Figure 5C, Figure 6 and
Supplementary Table 1). However, transcriptional activity
of VEGFA is notably higher in senescence then in actively
proliferating cells as further verified by qPCR analysis
shown in Figure 6. Notably, the SIVA1 gene encoding a
pro-apoptotic factor and a potent inducer of T-lymphocytes
apoptosis [41] is significantly down-regulated in senescent
cells upon IL-2 treatment in comparison to proliferating
hADSCs (Figure 5C and Supplementary Table1). In
addition, recently published data indicate that SIVA1 is not
a strictly pro-apoptotic factor, but also a potent suppressor
of tumor metastasis [42]. Importantly, a number of the
factors responsible for invasive growth and metastasis are
significantly up-regulated in SEN hADSCs primed with
IL-2 in comparison with similarly treated SR cells (Figure
5C). This includes PLEKHA1, PLEKHA6, CTSB, CRMP1,
FERMT1 genes.
These data indicate that pre-treatment/priming
of hADSCs with IL-2 may enhance the anti-apoptotic
properties of these cells in general, and such enhancement
is effected by replicative senescence, at least in culture. On
the other hand, it should be noted that down-regulation of
specific genes, such as SIVA1 (and probably many others)
and up-regulation of genes encoding potent metastasiswww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DISCUSSION

(Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). At the same time,
several factors that are essential for cytokinesis such
as MYL9, KIF14, IRAC3, as well as the gene encoding
chemotactic factor that attracts monocytes and basophils
(CCL2) and the CLEC11A gene regulating proliferation
and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells, are
down-regulated (Figure 5B). Similar down-regulation is
also found for several interleukin receptor encoding genes
IL7R, IL1R1, IL15RA, and interleukin enhancer binding
factors ILF2 and ILF3. Interestingly, TNFSF13(APRIL), a
novel death-inducing secreted ligand, has been previously
reported as both a cell proliferation-inducing [44] and cell
death triggering ligand [45], thus cautioning that the role
of the individual factors should be further investigated in
a context-dependent manner.
All together, these data support the hypothesis
that senescent mesenchymal stem cells, when subjected
to inflammatory environment, might have decreased
retention at the delivery site due to increased mobility.
These same senescent cells may also play a role in tumor
progression by promoting angiogenesis and metastasis.
Our data also point to numerous biological targets
critical for these events that can be prioritized for further
experimental studies with in-vivo models and in clinical
settings.

hADSCs are currently one of the primary sources
of stem cells with direct clinical relevance [46]. Human
MSCs may be able to both sense and respond to their
immediate environment, which make these cells ideal to
tune the response to injury and/or inflammation. It has
been rightfully suggested that MSCs should be called
Medicinal Signaling Cells as it was suggested in [47, 48].
The emerging evidence from studies of autoimmune
disorders and models of tumorigenesis indicates that the
immunomodulatory properties of adult mesenchymal
stem cells can be susceptible to the presence of IL-2 in
an inflammatory environment [49]. In addition, MSCs
themselves can produce therapeutic cytokines, such
as IFN-β [50] and interleukin-2 [51, 52] to provide for
beneficial anti-tumor effects. IL-2 is a potent cytokine that
is also proven to boost the immune system to fight cancer.
There are several FDA approved therapies currently on the
market that make use of IL-2 to fight metastatic melanoma
and renal cell carcinoma [53]. However, intravenous
administration of IL-2 may have an impact on numerous
tissues and organs in the body, including MSCs. Indeed,
recent data indicate that MSCs in general, and MSCs
derived from the adipose tissue, in particular, possess an

intrinsic preferential property to migrate actively toward
some tumor types upon their systemic administration [5456]. What remains unclear is how adult mesenchymal stem
cells may be affected by therapeutic doses of IL-2 and
what, if any, changes in transcriptional outcomes occur
with aging in response to IL-2 signaling. Our genomewide transcriptomic analysis of hADSCS subjected to IL-2
exposure/priming ex-vivo demonstrates that senescence
of stem cells substantially effects their transcriptional
response.
IL-2 signals via specific receptors, with three classes
of cell surface receptors formed by various combinations
of three IL-2R subunits: IL2Rα (CD25), IL2Rβ (CD122)
and IL2Rγ (CD132) [57]. Our experimental results
indicate that hADSCs transcriptionally express all three
receptors, however protein expression of the IL2Rα
in hADSCs is far lower than seen for IL2Rβ. These
observations suggest that an IL-2 receptor composition
consisting of IL2Rβ and IL2Rγ isoforms might mediate
the predominant form of IL-2 cytokine recognition
by hADSCs. The receptor composition changes only
slightly upon replicative aging of the hADSCs (Figure 2),
indicating that responsiveness of hADSCs to IL-2 does
not change upon their senescence. Alternatively, a slight
increase in membrane-bound IL2Rα upon replicative
senescence may reflect the activation state or ability to
trans-present IL2Rα rather than responsiveness to IL2, similar to what was previously reported for myeloid
dendritic cells [58]. In our current study, we cannot
discriminate between these events. In addition, our data
also point out to the interesting phenomenon, that the
production of IL2Rα drastically declines on transcriptional
level with replicative senescence of adipose-derived
MSCs. In accord with a previous report that in addition
to cell surface IL-2Rα, IL-2Rα can exist in a soluble
form (sIL-2Rα), which could be released from the cell
surface [59], we speculate that our data might provide an
indication of a less available soluble form of IL2Rα upon
replicative aging of hADSCs.
In our current study, we also attempted to interrogate
biochemical gene signaling networks activated in IL-2
primed SR and SEN hADSCs in order to gain insights into
impact of the replicative senescence on adipose-derived
MSCs function. Differential gene expression analysis,
comparing IL-2 treated versus untreated SR and SEN cells,
allowed us to uncover a number of individual genes that
are up- or down-regulated upon IL-2 stimulation. However,
the biological response to IL-2 treatment of hADSCs is
not likely to be orchestrated by individual genes acting
alone. Rather, this response is more likely to be based
on multiple co-regulated genes that function together in
integrated pathways. Furthermore, the biological pathways
that are affected by IL-2 treatment are also likely to be
functionally interconnected in the sense that they work
together to execute cellular responses to stimulation by IL2. We analyzed genes designated as up- or down-regulated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in IL-2 treated SR and SEN hADSCs using an integrated
gene-set enrichment and pathway network approach in an
attempt to capture the biological reality of coordinated
cellular responses to IL-2 stimulation. To do this, we first
identified pathways that were statistically enriched for
up- or down-regulated genes, and then we related these
pathways based on the differentially expressed genes
that they have in common (Table 1 and Table 2). We also
weighted the pathway network representation based on the
numbers of differentially expressed genes in each pathway
and the extent to which different pathways share sets of
differentially expressed genes. This approach allowed
us to elucidate a highly connected network structure
with numerous functionally related pathways as well as
functionally relevant network substructures.
Notably, upon senescence of hADSCs IL-2 is less
stimulatory for the gene pathways promoting proliferation
(cell cycle pathway, q-value = 1.54 e-5), imposing
G2 checkpoint (G2 pathway, q-value = 5.94e-4), p53
pathway (q-value = 1.18e-2), major signal transduction
MAPK pathway (MAPK, q-value = 2.42e-4) and its
major subgroup ERK pathway (ERK, q-value = 2.62e2), which regulate important cellular function such as
survival, migration and proliferation [60]. Our analysis
further corroborates the previous finding that PDGFinduced AKT and ERK pathways regulate opposing fate
decisions of proliferation and differentiation in order to
promote MSC self-renewal [61]. Activation of the genes
representing these pathways was observed only after
ex-vivo IL-2 priming of actively self-renewing human
ADSCs but not their senescent counterparts (Table
1, left side). Apparently, a different arm of the AKT
pathway (including up-regulated FOXO1, FOXO3 and
FOXO4 genes) acts upon exposure of SEN hADSCs to
inflammatory environment (Table 1, right side), which
could potentially be tumorigenic. The AKT pathway may
be important to promote IL-6 secretion (both the gene and
its biological pathway targets are transcriptionally upregulated in senescence Table1 and Figure 5B), which in
turn has been shown to contribute to the establishment of
the inflammatory environment and promote the resistance
of fibroblasts to apoptosis [62-64].
Our data also provide insights into the functionality
of MSCs in carcinogenic settings. Both SR and SEN
hADSCs primed by IL-2 are marked by drastic increases in
expression of transforming growth factors alpha and beta
(TGFα, TGFβ1 and TGFβ2), transforming growth factor
beta receptor TGFBR2 and transforming growth factor
beta receptor-associated protein TGFBRAP1, as well as
transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI) genes
(Figure 5A). Secreted TGFβ is believed to be important
in regulation of the immune system by promoting
differentiation of CD4+ T-cells and inhibiting immunesurveillance, thereby imposing immunosuppression [65].
However, the higher level of TGFβ expression in hADSCs
after exposure to IL-2 might promote carcinogenesis.

Since parts of the TGFβ signaling pathway are shown to
be mutated in cancer cells (see for the details in [66]), this
allows cancer cells to escape TGFβ-induced cell cycle
block, differentiation or apoptosis, while the surrounding
stromal, immune, endothelial and smooth muscle cells
still read the TGFβ signaling as a potent suppressor
of proliferation and trigger of differentiation causing
immunosuppression and angiogenesis in the cancer cell
microenvironment. Cancer cells exploit this environmental
condition to their advantage. In the absence of the
effector T-cells, which normally attack cancer, cancer
cells become more invasive [66-68]. Based on these
observations, we speculate that therapeutic delivery of
MSCs subjected either to prolonged expansion in culture,
or into the patients burdened by chronic inflammation,
are likely to create a microenvironment conducive to
cancer progression and metastasis. Similarly, systemic
administration of IL-2 as the treatment for cancer [69,70]
should take into consideration the age of the patient, since
aging might diminish MSCs similar to what is seen for
their ex-vivo replicative aging.
In support of this hypothesis, in IL-2 treated SEN
hADSCs prominent up-regulated genes are enriched for
pathways associated with inflammation (IL-6 pathway,
q-value = 5.55e-3) and EGF signaling (q-value = 2.33e4) that have been proven to provide a survival advantages
to mesenchymal stem cells [71]. The SEN hADSCs
primed with IL-2 are also marked by increased expression
of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12 (Figure 5B), cytokines known
to stimulate IL-17 from lymphocytes [72-74]. Our
data also indicate that lymphocytes are the only source
of IL-17D production, and those mesenchymal stem
cells, particularly upon their senescence, display high
transcriptional activity of IL-17 when subjected to a proinflammatory environment (Figure 5A). We hypothesize
that the MCS-derived IL-17D together with MCS-derived
CSF-1 might induce systemic neutrophil expansion and
macrophages infiltration similar to studies indicating
a critical role for these factors in promoting cancer
progression and metastasis [75-77] as well as in a number
of inflammatory diseases including psoriasis [73].
The observed connection to the angiogenic VEGF
pathway (q-value = 5.24e-3) (Table 1, right side and
Figure 5D) and the enhanced capacity of SEN hADSCs to
migration (Figure 1C, 1D) may suggest that IL-2 primed
SEN mesenchymal stem cells could acquire properties
necessary to support a tumorigenic environment and
metastasis. In addition, up-regulation of the genes included
in nitric oxide synthase pathway (iNOS) NOS1 pathway
(q-value = 8.32e-2) in hADSC upon replicative senescence
once again support the hypothesis that mesenchymal stem
cells undergoing senescence can acquire metastasispromoting properties via immunosuppression.
In the current study, we further corroborated that
aging poses a significant threat to adult MSC function
[78-80] [7] by providing evidence that critical pathways
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

essential for support of proliferation and DNA repair are
down-regulated in hADCSs upon senescence: Cell Cycle
pathway (q-value = 2.52e-5), MCM pathway (q-value =
1.62e-8), RB pathway (q-value = 6.97e-5) ATM pathway
(q-value = 3.28e-2), p53 pathway (q-value = 1.86 e-2)
shown in Table 2. Overall, our data indicate that there
are more biological pathways subjected to IL-2 triggered
down-regulation in senescence then in self-renewal and
these biological pathways are interconnected (Table 2),
further linking together a physiological impairment of
IL-2 response upon replicative aging of hADSCs, thus
suggesting that such impairment might be an integral to
adipose-derived stem cell deviated function in vivo and
upon clinical applications.
Our results, in concert with previously published
data, should raise awareness that replicative aging
of adult adipose-derived stem cells can impair their
immunomodulatory, angiogenic and antioxidative
functions, and in part, can explain several contradicting
studies related to either tumor-promoting [81-83] or
tumor-suppressive properties [55,84] of adipose-derived
MSCs. Our data also help to define biological pathways
and gene targets for in depth exploration of functional
activities of adipose-derived MSC therapeutic approaches
and further refinement of their application in clinical
settings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation, culture and characterization of MSCs
MSCs used in this research were isolated from
human adipose tissues obtained from healthy adult female
donors age 32 and 45 undergoing routine liposuction
procedures at the UCSD medical center, San Diego, CA.
The MSC isolation protocol was approved by the local
ethics committee and performed as previously described
[7]. Isolated adipose-derived stem cell lines were grown in
DMEM/F12 medium (Life Technologies). In accordance
with the MSC minimal definition criteria set by the
International Society for Cellular Therapy [85], flow
cytometric analysis showed that hADSCs express CD29,
CD73, CD90 and CD105 but do not express CD11b,
CD14, CD19, CD34, CD45, CD80, CD86 (antibodies
from eBiosciense, USA). Morphological analysis showed
that the cells present a fibroblast-like morphology, were
plastic adherent and capable of adipogenic, chondrogenic
and osteogenic differentiation under in vitro conditions
using commercially available differentiation mediums
(Invitrogen, USA). Cumulative population doublings
(PD) were calculated as PD = log(N/N0) x 3.33 across
the multiple passages as a function of the number of days
of growth in culture as described in [7], where N0 is the
number of cells plated in the flask and N is the number

of cells harvested at this passage. hADSCs PD 4 or PD 6
for self-renewing populations (SR) and PD 41 and 38 for
senescent populations (SEN) were used in all experiments.
Treatment with recombinant IL-2 (Peprotech, USA) was
performed as described in [86]. 20U/ml of IL-2 was added
to the culturing media for 24 hours at 37oC.

(ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Measurements of the concentrations of IL-2
receptors alpha and beta were obtained using human
IL-2R alpha and human IL-2R beta ELISA kits #ELHIL2Ra and #ELH-IL2Rb (RayBiotech, Inc) respectively.
The optical densities for the standards (recombinant IL-2
receptors alpha and beta) as well as the experimental
samples were measured at 450 nm by SPECTRA Max Plus
(Molecular Devices) and concentrations were calculated
as described in the manufacturer’s protocol.

Senescence–associated SA-β galactosidase assay
The assay for monitoring the expression of pHdependent senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity
(SA-βGal) was performed as described in manufacturer’s
kit (BioVision) and previously published in [7]. The
cultured hADSCs were fixed with fixative solution for
15 minutes at room temperature, washed with twice
with PBS and stained with X-Gal containing supplement
overnight at 37°C. The cells were washed twice with PBS,
and the images were captured using a microscope (Nikons,
TE300, DXM1200 Digital Camera, Japan).

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was isolated from hADSCs using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). cDNA was then
synthesized using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, USA). Real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using
TaqMan instrument. The expression levels were calculated
as 2− ∆∆Ct, where relative expression was determined by
normalization to beta-actin gene expression. All assays
were conducted in triplicates and negative control samples
without cDNA were used.

Migration and invasion assay
Transwell filters were from Corning Incorporated
(Acton, MA, USA) and all the cytokines in use were
obtained from Peprotech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA).
The migration assay was performed as described in [27]
using 8mm thick Transwell chambers. For the Transwell
migration assay, 1.0 x 104 cells were suspended in 80μl
of serum-free α-MEM and seeded in the upper chamber
of 24-well Transwell plates containing 8 mm pore size
filters (Corning, Costar, USA). In the lower chamber, 600
μl of DMEM or medium containing cytokines: IL-2, IL6, IL-8, TNF-α, HMGβ1 was added. The concentrations
used were: 50ng/ml IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and HMGβ1; 30ng/
ml TNF-α as described in [27]. hADSCs were incubated
at 37°C for 16h. The cells retained in the upper chamber
were removed by swab and those that had migrated
through the filter were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 20 minutes at room temperature and stained overnight
with 5% toluidine blue. The cells were counted at the
lower side; in five different randomly selected 10x fields
using a bright-field microscope (NikonTE300, DXM1200
Digital Camera, Japan). These experiments were done
with hADSCs of two female donors age 32 and 45, either
self-renewing (SR) or senescent (SEN) populations, with
each donor sampled more than three times.

Transcriptomic analysis
Transcriptomic analysis was performed with
IL-2 treated and untreated (control group) SR and SEN
hADSCs as previously described in [86]. The two
genotypes shown in Figure 1A were used for the analysis
of four different conditions: self-renewal (SR), replicative
senescence (SEN) without or with IL-2 stimulation
respectively. Cells were seeded in DMEMF12 (106)
media for each experimental condition, and IL-2 treatment
was performed by adding 20U/ml of recombinant IL-2
(Peprotech, USA) directly into the media for 24 hours
as previously described in [86]. Total RNA was isolated

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
hADSCs (SR or SEN) were plated at a density of
105 cells per 10 cm2 dish and treated with 20 U/mL of
IL-2 for 24 hour, with untreated controls as previously
described in [86]. Then, cell membrane-associated protein
fractions were prepared using Mem-PER Plus #89842

from samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples
from two different patients were combined together for
the relevant conditions and RNA concentrations were
measured with the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer using the RNA
HS Assay kit (Invitrogen, Life technologies, USA).
100ng of total RNA from each sample was used to
construct the libraries for sequencing on the Ion ProtonTM
System (Life technologies, USA) following manufacturers
instructions. Prior to rRNA depletion and RNA-seq
library construction, the ERCC RNA Spike-In Control
mix (Ambion, Life Technologies) was added to total RNA
for quality control analysis. The ERCC RNA Spike-In
control mix contains 92 transcripts 250-2000 nt in length
that mimic natural eukaryotic mRNAs. According to the
protocol provided by manufacturer, for 100 ng of total
RNA was added to 2ul of Mix1 in dilution 1:1000 of
spike-in. Afterwards, rRNA depletion was performed with
the Low Input Ribominus Eukaryote System v2 (Ambion,
Life technologies, USA). cDNA libraries were constructed
with Ion total RNA-seq kit v2 (Ambion, Life technologies,
USA), and barcoded with Ion Xpress RNA-seq barcode
(Ambion, Life technologies). The size distribution and
quantification of the libraries were performed on a
Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent technologies, USA). Library
sequencing was performed on the Ion ProtonTM System
with P1 chip, and each library was sequenced 3 times.

between pairs of libraries was performed using the
program GFOLD v1.1.3 [87]. GFOLD was chosen based
on its demonstrated superior performance in characterizing
differentially expressed genes in the absence of replicate
data sets. GFOLD analysis yields a score that measures the
extent of differential gene expression between conditions;
the recommended GFOLD score cut-off of ±0.01 was used
to define differentially expressed genes here. Functional
enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes
between pairs of libraries was performed using the
program GSEA v2.1.0 [88]. Specifically, individual
pathways containing multiple genes that are up-regulated
or down-regulated upon IL-2 treatment in SR, SEN or
both were identified using GSEA. Individual pathways
for specific sets of differentially regulated genes (IL-2+
up-regulated in SR and/or SEN and IL-2+ down-regulated
in SR and/or SEN) were related using networks where the
nodes correspond to pathways and the edges correspond to
the presence of shared genes between pathways.

RNA-seq data analysis
RNA-seq reads from individual Ion ProtonTM
System sequencing runs were combined for each of
the four libraries. Sequence reads were mapped to the
reference human genome assembly hg19 (GRCh37)
using the Torrent Mapping Alignment Program (TMAP,
Life technologies). The quality of the four conditionspecific combined RNA-seq runs was evaluated by
comparing the expected counts of ERCC spike-in RNA
sequences, obtained from the manufacturer’s website,
against the observed counts of RNA-seq tags that map
to the same sequences (Supplementary Figure 2). Initial
gene expression levels were taken as the sum of exonmapped reads for individual NCBI RefSeq gene models
(c), and lowly expressed genes (read counts per million
< 1) were removed from subsequent analyses. For each
library, individual gene expression levels were normalized
using the beta-actin (ACTB) expression levels (cACTB)
and the total exon length l of each gene. For library j,
the beta-acting normalization factor sj was calculated
