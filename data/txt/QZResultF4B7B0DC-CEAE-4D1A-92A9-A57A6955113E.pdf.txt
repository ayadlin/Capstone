BACKGROUND. Currently, no consistently effective therapy is available to inhibit
cell proliferation or metastasis of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) disease. The
effects of 4 novel peptides were analyzed: a targeted cytotoxic analog of luteinizMD

ity. Proliferation of the GH-RH receptor expressing lung NET, NCI-H727 line, was
inhibited by both GH-RH antagonists, the effects being mediated through
changes in Ki67 expression, but not in caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. The small
intestinal NET, KRJ-I line, was 83 more sensitive to inhibition by AN-238 than to
2-pyrolino-doxorubicin, reflected by increased caspase 3 transcript as well as activity. AN-238-mediated growth inhibition culminated in complete G1 arrest.
CONCLUSIONS. The data demonstrate GH-RH antagonists or peptide-linked antineoplastic agents such as AN-152 and AN-238 are effective inhibitors of NET proliferation in vitro. Because peptide receptors such as those for GH-RH, LH-RH,
and SST subtypes are commonly expressed by NETs, the development of antineoplastic agents targeted to specific tumor receptors may provide a more efficacious strategy than systemic chemotherapeutic agents currently in use. Cancer

euroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a group of neoplasms that
originate in neuroendocrine cells and are part of the diffuse
neuroendocrine system that is spread throughout the gastrointestinal tract and the bronchopulmonary system.1 Overall, NETs are
diverse in their specific cells of origin (enterochromaffin, EC-like,
etc), secrete a variety of amines and peptides, and present a wide
variety of symptoms including flushing, sweating, and diarrhea.2
The SEER database demonstrates that NETs are increasing in
incidence at a rate of 10% per year and therefore represent a

substantial clinical problem.2,3 The majority of NETs
arise in the gastrointestinal tract (67.5%), but a considerable number is present in the bronchopulmonary system (25.3%).3
Although in the past these lesions were considered to exhibit a benign behavior, it is now apparent
that this is incorrect and, indeed, the vast majority
are metastatic at diagnosis.4 Initial therapy is therefore directed toward surgical removal of the primary
and ablation or resection of as much metastatic disease as is safe and feasible.5 Given the relatively indolent biological behavior, conventional radiotherapy
is of little value. Similarly, there is no specific chemotherapy and current clinical data indicate that objective tumor responses occur only in 10% of
patients.5 Novel cytotoxic agents including antiangiogenic drugs, growth factor inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been studied,6,7 but their utility
is limited and many patients exhibit substantial
adverse effects.5 Because the majority of these
tumors express somatostatin receptor subtype 2
(SSTR2), to date the best available approach has
been the use of long-acting somatostatin analogs
such as Somatuline, which are effective in the amelioration of symptomatology.8 Whereas this class of
pharmacotherapeutic agents inhibits the secretion of
bioactive agents and hence symptoms, it is ineffective in the inhibition of neuroendocrine cell proliferation.2,5
An approach based on targeted antineoplastic
therapy focusing on specific molecular pathways or
receptors expressed by malignant cells, while leaving
normal cells unaffected, has promise.9,10 Thus, the
observation of increased expression of SSTR2 by NET
cells has been proposed for a strategy to use cytotoxic peptide conjugates to selectively deliver specific
agents to NETS and their metastases. The linkage of
high-energy radioisotopes (111In, 90Y, 177Lu) to somatostatin analogs administered intravenously has
been used with some success to treat GEP-NETs.11
Although the ideal isotope remains to be identified
and issues with renal and bone marrow toxicity
require careful observation, it seems likely that this
concept will prove of therapeutic benefit.12
An alternative strategy to peptide receptor radiotherapy (PPRT) is the use of receptor-targeted chemotherapy using specific cytotoxins. The approach of
using peptides (eg, luteinizing hormone releasing
hormone, LH-RH), somatostatin or bombesin/GRP
that target the NET cell and are conjugated to chemotherapeutic agents (eg, doxorubicin) known to
have efficacy in NET management13 has been extensively investigated. Experimental studies in human
cancer cell lines xenografted into nude mice have

1405

indicated that this strategy is feasible and effective.12,14,15 Thus, the cytotoxic LH-RH analog, doxorubicin conjugated to AN-152, has been investigated
in a variety of cancers (breast, ovarian, endometrial,
and prostate cancers) with promising results16 and is
now in phase 2 clinical trials in Germany. Preclinical
evaluation of the cytotoxic somatostatin analog, AN238, has demonstrated it to be effective on a wide
variety of non-neuroendocrine tumors (melanoma,
hepatoma, glioblastomas, non-Hodgkin lymphoma
[NHL]).14 Another approach consists of antagonists
of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH),
which act on specific tumor receptors for GH-RH
and inhibit growth of a broad variety of human experimental tumor models (small-cell lung carcinoma,
prostate carcinoma, NHL).17–19 GH-RH antagonists
are thought to function through inhibition of autocrine/paracrine production of IGF-I and IGF-II in
tumors and/or the blockade of the stimulatory effect
of GH-RH in tumors.19 Little is known about the
effects of such agents on GEP-NETs.
In this study we investigated whether these peptide analogs might be effective in human neuroendocrine cells and examined the mechanisms by which
these classes of agents affect NET cells. We evaluated
the cytotoxic LH-RH analog AN-152 and the somatostatin analog AN-238 as well as 2 GH-RH antagonists
to assess the inhibition of cell proliferation in 3 NET
(carcinoid) cell lines. Our goal was to determine
whether GH-RH antagonists could be used for inhibition of NET cell lines and, if so, to assess whether
targeting specific LH-RH receptors, SSTR2, 3, and 5
receptors, as well as whether GH-RH antagonists
could be used for inhibition of NET cell lines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The studies were undertaken in 3 NET cell lines; an
atypical lung carcinoid (NCI-H720), a typical bronchial carcinoid (NCI-H727), and a small intestinal
carcinoid (KRJ-I).20,21 The receptor profile of each
cell line was first examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MTT uptake (after 72 hours
incubation with each agent: 1–100 nM) was used to
measure the efficacy of each cytotoxic-analog or GHRH antagonist to inhibit cell proliferation compared
with the cytotoxic radical alone. Inhibition of cell
proliferation by IC50 concentrations of each effective
agent was confirmed using real-time quantitative
PCR and the normalization of expression levels of
the target gene, Ki67, using geNorm and 3 housekeeping genes (ALG9, TFCP2, and ZNF410).22 Apoptotic pathway activation after treatment with the
IC50 concentrations of each agent was evaluated by

PCR analysis of caspase 3 transcript and measurement of caspase 3 activity using the PhiPhiLux
assay.23,24 Finally, flow cytometric analysis was performed and cell cycle alterations were examined in
response to IC50 concentrations of each compound
over a 72-hour period (2 population doubling times
for each cell line20,21). The requirement for trypsin
digest with the associated cell death in the adherent
NCI-H727 cell line precluded flow cytometric analysis.

Peptide Analogs
Cytotoxic LH-RH conjugate AN-152 consists of LHRH linked to doxorubicin (Dox).25 Dox hydrochloride
was obtained from Chemex Export-Import (Vienna,
Austria). The SST analog RC-121 was coupled with 1
molecule of 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin-14-0-hemiglutarate (AN-201) to form AN-238.26 AN-201 (Dox2) was
synthesized by a conversion of Dox to 30 -deamino-30 (200 -pyrroline-100 -yl) doxorubicin.25
The GH-RH antagonists MZ-4-71 and MZ-5-156
are based on the N-terminal sequence of 29 amino
acid residues of hGH-RH, but contain D-Arg2, Nle27,
and other modifications.27,28 All therapeutic analogs
were synthesized in the laboratories of one of us
(A.V.S.).
Culture Conditions
KRJ-I and NCI-H720 cells were cultured as floating
aggregates at 378C with 5% CO2. KRJ-I cells were
kept in Ham F12 medium (Gibco, Gaithersburg, Md)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, Mo), penicillin 100 U/mL, and
streptomycin (100 mg/mL).21,29,30 For NCI-H720, a 1:1
solution of Ham F12 and Dulbecco minimal essential
medium (DMEM) supplemented with final concentrations of FBS (5%), insulin (0.005 mg/mL), transferrin (0.01 mg/mL), sodium selenite (30 nM),
hydrocortisone (10 nM), b-estradiol (10 nM), HEPES
medium (10 mM), and L-glutamine (2 mM) was
used.20 The adhesive growing NCI-H727 cells were
kept at 378C in RPMI 1640 medium containing final
concentrations of FBS (10%), L-glutamine (2 mM),
sodium pyruvate (1 mM), and glucose (2.5 g/L).20 For
subculturing, NCI-H727 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before trypsin-EDTA was
applied.
Proliferation Studies
After centrifugation (5 minutes; 1500g) pellets were
resuspended in respective media to a concentration
of 5 3 105 cells/mL and seeded in 96-well plates at
100 mL with 5 3 104 cells/well (4 plates/experimental
condition).29,30 Lanes 1 and 2 contained negative
(medium only) and positive (cell suspension) con-

trols. Drugs were diluted in PBS and applied at final
concentrations from 1 nM to 100 nM (n 5 6 wells
for each concentration/plate).

MTT Assay
After 72 hours of incubation (378C; 5% CO2), MTT
(3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) was added to a final concentration of
0.5 mg/mL per well followed by additional incubation for 3 hours.29-31 The reaction was stopped and
the formazan dye solubilized by adding an equal volume (100 mL) of acid-isopropanol (0.01 N HCl-isopropanol). The optical density was read at 595 nm
using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad 3500, Hercules,
Calif).29,30 Values were averaged in each of the 6 treated wells and values for media alone (lane 1) were
subtracted. These values were then normalized to
control (unstimulated cells, lane 2) and used to calculate the effective half-maximal concentrations for
each drug as well as the percentage of cell death
(treated values, normalized to control 3 100).29,30
RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription
Total RNA was extracted from each cell line (n 5 4)
using TRIZOL (Invitrogen, La Jolla, Calif) and the
RNA quality assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif) to visually verify
the absence of genomic DNA contamination, integrity and ratio of 28S and 18S bands. Samples with
A260/A280 ratio 1.8 were used for PCR.22,29 Total
RNA (2 mg) from each preparation was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif).
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction (Q RT-PCR)
Q RT-PCR was performed using the ABI 7900
Sequence Detection System. Briefly, cDNA in 7.2 mL
of water was mixed with 0.8 mL of 20 3 Assays-onDemand primer (caspase 3, Ki-67, LHRH-R, the pituitary type GHRH-R and SSTR 1-5) and probe mix,
8 mL of 2 3 TaqMan Universal Master mix in a 384well optical reaction plate. The following PCR conditions were used: 508C for 2 minutes, then 958C for
10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles at 958C / 0.15 minutes and 608C / 1 minute.30 Data were normalized
using geNorm32 and expression of the novel housekeeping genes, ALG9, TFCP2, and ZNF410.22,30
Detection of Caspase-3 Activity by FACS
For the analysis of caspase-3 activity, cells were
plated in 12 well plates (1 3 106 cells/well in 1 mL)
and treated for 21 hours with IC50 values (from the
proliferation studies) of each agent of interest. Cas-

pase-3 activity was evaluated using the PhiPhiLux
G1D2 kit (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) as described.23,24 A
substrate of PhiPhiLux G1D2, which can penetrate
into the cell nucleus, is converted to the fluorescent
form when cleaved by the protease activity of caspase-3. The assessment was performed according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, cells
were incubated with 75 lL of PhiPhiLux G1D2 for
1 hour at 378C in 5% CO2, and caspase-3 activity
analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting
caliber flow cytometry as described.23,24

Cell Cycle Analysis
For the analysis of the cell cycle, cells were plated in
12 well plates (1 3 106 cells/well in 1 mL) and treated for 24, 48, and 72 hours with IC50 values (from
the proliferation studies) of each agent of interest. At
the end of the experiment cells were fixed in 1 mL
75% ethanol and maintained at room temperature.
For cell cycle analysis, fixed cells were resuspended
in PBS and stained with propidium iodide (PI, 5 mg/
mL) immediately before FACS analysis (BD FACS
Aria, Yale Cancer Center).33 Cell cycle alterations

were analyzed using FloJo Software (TreeStar, Calif)
and the Dean-Jett-Fox algorithm.33

Statistical Evaluation
All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, Calif).

RESULTS
Real-Time PCR Receptor Profile
Analysis of receptor levels by real-time PCR (Fig. 1)
in each of the cell lines demonstrated that the LHRH receptor (LH-RH-R) was detectable in the atypical lung carcinoid cell line NCI-H720 (Fig. 1B),
whereas the pituitary type GH-RH receptor (GH-RHR) was expressed only in the bronchial carcinoid cell
line NCI-H727 (Fig. 1A). Neither receptor was identified in the small intestinal KRJ-I cell line. Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) also demonstrated a variable
expression profile. NCI-H720 exhibited low expression of SSTR2 and R5 and no expression of SSTR1
and R3, whereas SSTR5 had the highest expression
level in NCI-H727, followed by SSTR1, R3, and R2.

KRJ-I
The LH-RH-doxorubicin analog (AN-152) and both
the GH-RH-R antagonists were ineffective in inhibiting KRJ-I cell proliferation (Fig. 2G,I). In contrast,
AN-238 was 83 as effective (0.5 nM vs 4 nM) as
Dox2 alone (Fig. 2H).

Effects of Inhibitors on Transcript Levels
of Ki67 and Caspase 3
NCI-H70
Both AN-152 and Dox significantly (P < .05) inhibited
transcript levels of Ki67 in NCI-H720 cells compared
with untreated cells (control), demonstrating that
decreased Ki67 transcription characterized inhibition
of cell proliferation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, caspase 3
transcripts were significantly elevated by both AN152 and Dox in NCI-H720 cells (Fig. 3D), indicating
that these agents activate this apoptotic pathway in
this cell line.

NCI-H727
MZ-5-156 significantly inhibited Ki67 levels compared
with both MZ-4-71 (P 5 .02) and untreated cells
(P 5 .01) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, neither MZ-4-71 nor MZ5-156 altered caspase 3 transcripts in NCI-H727 cells
(Fig. 3E), suggesting that this apoptotic pathway was not
activated by these GH-RH receptor antagonists.
KRJ-I
Both AN-201 and AN-238 inhibited Ki67 levels in
KRJ-I cells (Fig. 3C). Whereas AN-201 had no effect
on caspase 3 transcription, AN-238 significantly
(P < .05) elevated caspase 3 in KRJ-I cells (Fig. 3F).

the proportions of unstained cells (live cells) or the double-stained (PI and PhiPhiLux) cells between controls or
cells treated with either AN-152 or Dox cells.

KRJ-I
In KRJ-1 cells, treatment with AN-238 significantly
increased (P 5 .05) the number of caspase 3-positive

In NCI-H720 cells, AN-152 caused a decrease in the growth rate that was evident as early as 48 hours (B). Dox also slowed the cell cycle but this effect was

with any significant alteration in the cell cycle.

In KRJ-I cells, AN-238 caused a decrease in the
growth rate that culminated in a complete G1 arrest
between 48-72 hours (Fig. 5E,F). Dox2 was not associated with any significant alteration in the cell cycle.

DISCUSSION
Therapy for NETs is currently limited because no
specific therapy is available to inhibit neuroendocrine cell proliferation and metastasis. Our investigation of 3 human neuroendocrine cell lines
demonstrates that cytotoxic agents linked to analogs
that target specific NET receptors provide an effective
mechanism for inhibiting NET proliferation and
inducing apoptosis in vitro. It was notable that each
cell line responded to different agents. This suggests
that individual tumor receptor profiling may be
required to identify the most appropriate and relevant target in a particular lesion and to adapt the
appropriate therapy for each patient with NETs.

LH-RH Analog: AN-152
The atypical lung NET (NCI-H720) that expressed
LH-RH-R was more responsive to Dox linked to an
LH-RH analog (AN-152) than to Dox alone. The 2

other cell lines (a typical lung and small intestinal
carcinoid/NET) showed no significant inhibitory
response to this agent. This is consistent with the observation that neither of them expressed a transcript
for this receptor. AN-152 was twice as effective as
Dox alone (IC50 of 9.1 nM vs 24 nM) and killed more
NCI-H720 cells (30% cell death after 72 hours vs
20%). This was confirmed by real-time PCR, which
demonstrated a reduction of Ki67 transcript. The
increase in caspase 3 mRNA levels was mirrored by
an increased caspase 3 activity that demonstrates
that a mechanism of AN-152 cytotoxicity is induction
of apoptosis (Table 1). These effects were complemented by an overall decrease in the growth rate of
these cells (cell cycle analysis) confirming inhibition
of proliferation. AN-152 has previously been shown
to be an effective inhibitor of tumor growth in breast,
prostate, endometrial, and ovarian cancers.16 In addition, because LH-RH-R is known to be expressed at
very low levels on most normal tissues apart from
the pituitary,34 targeting this receptor, particularly in
NETs with high receptor expression, suggests that the
LH-RH analog is a potentially useful target for receptor targeted chemotherapy. Clinical phase 1 trials with
AN-152 in women with gynecologic tumors have been
completed and phase 2 is in progress.

SST Analog: AN-238
It has previously been reported that the antitumoral
effect of AN-238 is essentially equal in xenografted
human tumors that express either SSTR2 or SSTR5
(and produced a similar reduction in tumor volume:
67% vs 78%).35 The SST receptor expression profiles
we identified (Fig. 1) suggest that AN-238 would be
most effective on KRJ-I and NCI-H727 cells. NCIH720 expresses lower levels of the type 2 and 5 SST
receptors and does not express the other subtypes.
AN-238 was identified to be an effective inhibitor of
KRJ-I proliferation (83 as effective as doxorubicin
alone) and the degree of cell inhibition was substantially higher than for either NCI-H727 or NCI-H720,
which were not preferentially inhibited by this agent
compared with the chemotherapeutic radical alone.
In addition, AN-238 increased both caspase 3 transcripts and caspase 3 activity and caused a decrease
in KRJ-I growth that culminated in complete G1
arrest (Table 1). Doxorubicin is an anthracycline that
inhibits topoisomerase II by formation of a tripartite
complex with the enzyme, which prevents the religation of broken DNA strands and finally leads to
apoptosis.36 Doxorubicin is also known to disrupt the
S-phase of the cell cycle. Although somatostatin is
considered to activate cyclin inhibitors, particularly
P27KIP1, which is recognized to inhibit G0/G1 and
cause cell cycle arrest,37 the inhibition of KRJ-I proliferation probably reflects an effect only of targeted
doxorubicin because the dose of somatostatin analog
RC-121 contained in the conjugate was low (0.5 nM).
Clinical studies in patients with GEP-NETs have
provided only minimal evidence for an antitumorigenic role for somatostatin analogs.38 Whereas
somatostatin effectively regulates carcinoid symptomatology (through inhibition of secretory products),5,8 a role in inhibiting tumor growth in vivo
remains to be proven. Doxorubicin itself is of modest
and unpredictable efficacy (16%-20% objective therapeutic response) in the treatment of NETs.39,40 Our
current study indicates that a hybrid of a somatostatin analog RC-121 and doxorubicin targeted to SST

receptors may provide an effective mechanism for
treating GEP-NET cells.

GH-RH Antagonists: MZ-4-71 and MZ-5-156
GH-RH antagonists were developed for inhibition of
tumor growth because somatostatin analogs did not
have adequate oncologic activity.17,18,41 The findings
that extrapituitary tumors (eg, prostatic, mammary,
renal, NHL, lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers)
express GH-RH-R splice variants has extended the
types of neoplasia that could be treated by such
antagonists.42 We demonstrated that the typical lung
NET cell line, NCI-H727, transcribed GH-RH-R,
which suggested that the GH-RH antagonists could
potentially inhibit proliferation of these cells but
would have no effect on NCI-H720 or KRJ-I, which
do not express transcripts for the receptor.
Both MZ-4-71 and especially the more potent
MZ-5-156 had an inhibitory effect on NCI-H727 but
not on KRJ-I. Moreover, whereas MZ-4-71 had no
effect on NCI-H720, MZ-5-156 did inhibit cell proliferation (Table 1). This finding in a tumor cell line
that did not express transcripts for the pituitary type
of GH-RH receptor could be due either to the inability of real-time PCR to identify all splice variants of
the receptor or to potential crossreactivity with
another receptor. Because of the difference in primers, the expression of SV-type receptors in tumors
that bind GH-RH antagonists is more common than
that of pGH-RH receptors. Another splice variant of
the GH-RH receptor that cannot signal through the
cAMP pathway and acts as a dominant inhibitor of
wildtype receptor signaling has also been identified.43 The probes we used to identify GH-RH receptor expression do not detect these particular variants.
Given the difficulties with adherent cell subculturing
and the potential apoptotic effects from trypsin
digestion protocols, we were not able to evaluate
whether the effects of GH-RH-R antagonists were
due to apoptosis or to alterations in the cell cycle in
H727 cells. Our evaluation of transcripts for Ki67 and
caspase 3, however, suggested that an alteration in

NETs and Peptide Analogs Targeting Receptors/Kidd et al.

the cell cycle, rather than caspase 3-mediated apoptosis, was probably the inhibitory mechanism of
these agents in this cell line.
In summary, our data demonstrate that chemotherapeutics linked to peptides have the capability to be effective inhibitors of NET cell proliferation.
Thus, a NET cell expressing the appropriate receptor
for the peptide carrier provides a target that permits
the binding of the hybrid-containing chemotherapeutic agent to the tumor and makes it more effective than when delivered alone. It is thus feasible
that, given the presence of various peptide receptors
like GH-RH-R, LH-RH-R, and SSTR subtypes in
NETs, receptor targeted chemotherapy using a peptide vector based may offer a clinical advantage.
Such targeted therapy to neuroendocrine cells would
be predicted to have more efficacy and less toxicity
than the systemic chemotherapeutic agents currently
in use.5 Because appropriate receptors of individual
tumors can be selectively identified, an escalation of
dose may be achievable with predictably better outcome. To optimize such therapy, the cell biology of
individual tumors would have to be characterized
based on biopsy material, and once a profile was
established in a patient a tumor-specific cytotoxic
hybrid or GH-RH antagonist could be administered.
