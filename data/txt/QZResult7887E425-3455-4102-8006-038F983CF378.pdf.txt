ABSTRACT
The survival of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM), the most deadly
form of brain cancer, is compromised by the proclivity for local invasion into the
surrounding normal brain, which prevents complete surgical resection and contributes
to therapeutic resistance. Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis
(TWEAK), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, can stimulate
glioma cell invasion and survival via binding to fibroblast growth factor-inducible
14 (Fn14) and subsequent activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. To discover
small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the TWEAK-Fn14 signaling axis, we utilized a
cell-based drug-screening assay using HEK293 cells engineered to express both Fn14
and a NF-κB-driven firefly luciferase reporter protein. Focusing on the LOPAC1280
library of 1280 pharmacologically active compounds, we identified aurintricarboxylic
acid (ATA) as an agent that suppressed TWEAK-Fn14-NF-κB dependent signaling,
but not TNFα-TNFR-NF-κB driven signaling. We demonstrated that ATA repressed
TWEAK-induced glioma cell chemotactic migration and invasion via inhibition of
Rac1 activation but had no effect on cell viability or Fn14 expression. In addition,
ATA treatment enhanced glioma cell sensitivity to both the chemotherapeutic agent
temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation-induced cell death. In summary, this work reports
a repurposed use of a small molecule inhibitor that targets the TWEAK-Fn14 signaling
axis, which could potentially be developed as a new therapeutic agent for treatment
of GBM patients.

statistics for patients have not improved significantly over
the past three decades [3, 4]. This strongly highlights the
need to establish novel therapeutic strategies.
Therapeutic failure and the consequent morbidity and
mortality derive, in part, from the genetic heterogeneity and
invasive proclivity of this tumor [5, 6]. Surgical resection
eliminates the bulk tumor but the penumbra around the
tumor border is a critical and challenging prognostic factor
[7, 8]. Often following along myelinated white matter

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM), or grade IV astrocytoma, is
the most common primary malignant intracranial tumor
in adults [1]. The current standard of therapy for newly
diagnosed GBM is surgical resection with concurrent
radiation and chemotherapy [2]. Despite aggressive
treatment and recent clinical advances, the median
survival from diagnosis is only 15 months and the survival

tracts, the neoplastic cells disperse from the tumor border
and infiltrate the normal brain parenchyma [9–11]. This
invasive sub-population is inherently resistant to cytotoxic
therapy, which precludes effective clinical management
of GBM and results in tumor recurrence [5, 12, 13].
Improved clinical treatment ultimately requires a thorough
understanding of the signaling pathways that drive glioma
invasion and the development of small molecule inhibitors
specifically targeting the critical regulators.
Gene expression analysis of glioma cells migrating
in vitro and invading in vivo has identified several gene
candidates potentially involved in cell invasion and survival,
including the tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of
apoptosis (TWEAK) – fibroblast growth factor inducible 14
(Fn14) signaling axis [14, 15]. TWEAK is a multifunctional
member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily
of cytokines that is initially expressed as a transmembrane
glycoprotein but can be proteolytically processed to its
soluble form. TWEAK exerts its biological effects on cells
via binding to the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily member
Fn14, which is a type Ia transmembrane receptor lacking a
cytoplasmic death domain. The TWEAK-Fn14 signaling
axis plays an important role in regulating various aspects
of tumor behavior such as growth, survival, invasion and
angiogenesis [16–18]. Fn14 mRNA and protein expression
is minimal to absent in normal brain tissue but increased with
brain tumor grade and correlated with poor patient outcome
[15, 19]. Activation of Fn14 enhanced glioma cell invasion
and survival, which were mediated, in part, by Rac1 and NFκB [19–24]. Thus, Fn14 plays a critical role in cancer cell
invasion and survival and represents a potential therapeutic
vulnerability in GBM. Currently, only one small molecule
has been described in the literature that inhibits the TWEAKFn14 signaling cascade [25]. This molecule, L524-0366,
prevents TWEAK: Fn14 engagement via binding to Fn14.
However, L524-0366 is a tool compound and not suitable
for clinical use. Thus, we developed a high throughput
assay to screen for additional small-molecule inhibitors of
TWEAK-Fn14 signaling and identified aurintricarboxylic
acid (ATA) as a potent inhibitory compound. ATA inhibited
TWEAK-induced Fn14 activation of downstream signaling
pathways and suppressed glioma cell migration and invasion.
Moreover, ATA suppressed TWEAK-induced glioma survival
in the presence of genotoxic stress. Taken together, these data
demonstrate that ATA may be a potential therapeutic agent to
limit invasion and enhance chemotherapeutic drug efficacy
in GBM.

therapeutic efficacy in GBM [15, 19, 20]. TWEAKFn14 signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis
of multiple diseases, ranging from autoimmune disorders
to cancer; however, to date, only one small-molecule
inhibitor of TWEAK-Fn14 signaling has been reported
[25]. To identify drug-like inhibitors of the TWEAKFn14 pathway, we developed a cell-based assay for
high-throughput screening (HTS) using the LOPAC1280
library of 1280 pharmacologically active compounds.
Since parental HEK293 cells express low levels of Fn14
and exhibit a minimal cellular response to exogenous
TWEAK treatment [26, 27], we engineered HEK293 cells
to overexpress Fn14 as well as a NF-κB-driven luciferase
reporter. Stimulation with TWEAK is predicted to promote
Fn14 trimerization, TNFR-associated factor (TRAF)
recruitment to the Fn14 cytoplasmic tail, and downstream
NF-κB activation [16]. Activated NF-κB then translocates
to the nucleus and triggers firefly luciferase expression
(Figure 1A). This cell-based assay interrogates allosteric
modulators that can have a functional consequence
throughout the TWEAK-Fn14 signaling pathway. In
the preliminary drug-screening assay, we found that
aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) (Figure 1B) specifically
inhibited TWEAK-Fn14-mediated NF-κB activation.
Dose response curves of inhibitory activity of ATA in NFκB-Luc and NF-κB-Luc/Fn14 cells following TWEAK or
TNFα stimulation showed that ATA specifically inhibited
only Fn14-driven NF-κB activation, with an IC50 of 0.6
μM (Figure 1C). ATA did not demonstrate any cytotoxic
effects on NF-κB-Luc or NF-κB-Luc/Fn14 cells, which
indicates the effect of ATA on TWEAK-Fn14 signaling is
due to a specific pharmacological effect (Figure 1D).

ATA suppressed TWEAK-Fn14-mediated NFκB, Akt, and Src phosphorylation in GBM cells
Since ATA suppressed TWEAK stimulation of
NF-κB activity in HEK293 cells, we next investigated
the effects of ATA on signaling cascades downstream
of Fn14 using two established glioma cell lines (T98G
and A172) and the GBM patient-derived xenograft
(PDX) line GBM44. Prior to initiating these studies,
we first confirmed that ATA treatment of glioma cells
did not alter Fn14 mRNA (data not shown) or protein
(Figure 2A) levels. Treatment with ATA abrogated
TWEAK activation of downstream signals including
phosphorylation of the NF-κB family member p65, Akt,
and Src in all three GBM cell lines (Figure 2B). Together,
this data corroborates the role of ATA as an inhibitor of
TWEAK-Fn14 signaling.

RESULTS

aurintricarboxylic acid as a specific inhibitor of
TWEAK-Fn14 signaling

TWEAK-stimulated Rac1 activity and TRAF2

TWEAK-Fn14 signaling promotes the activation of
Rac1 to regulate glioma cell migration and invasion [19,

to examine the effect of ATA on TWEAK-induced Rac1
activation. ATA treatment effectively inhibited activation
of Rac1 by TWEAK in the A172 and T98G cell lines
(Figure 3A). TWEAK binding to Fn14 results in receptor
trimerization, TRAF association with the Fn14 cytoplasmic
tail, and the initiation of downstream signaling cascades
that result in pleiotropic cellular responses [16]. We have
demonstrated that a functional TRAF binding domain
and recruitment of TRAF2 is required for TWEAKdependent signaling, including activation of the NF-κB
and SGEF pathways [20, 23, 29]. Since we observed that
ATA decreases TWEAK activation of NF-κB, we next
investigated if ATA alters TRAF2 recruitment to Fn14.
A172 and GBM44 cells were stimulated by TWEAK
in the presence or absence of ATA and TRAF2 binding
to Fn14 was investigated via a co-immunoprecipitation

assay. Immunoprecipitation of TRAF2 after TWEAK
treatment showed an increased binding of TRAF2 to Fn14.
However, ATA suppressed TRAF2 binding to Fn14 in both
cell lines (Figure 3B). Co-precipitation of TRAF2 was
verified in immunoprecipitations with an Fn14 antibody
(data not shown).

ATA inhibited TWEAK-Fn14 mediated GBM
migration and invasion
Previous studies have shown that knockdown of
Fn14 or signaling axis proteins downstream of this receptor
inhibit TWEAK-stimulated glioma cell chemotactic
migration and invasion [15, 19, 22]. To corroborate these
results with pharmacological inhibition of Fn14 signaling,
we investigated if ATA suppressed TWEAK-dependent

Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. We observed that
ATA significantly repressed TWEAK-induced glioma cell
migration (Figure 4A) and invasion (Figure 4B) in T98G,
A172, and GBM44 cell lines in vitro without altering cell
viability (Figure 4C).

polymerase (PARP) cleavage as a marker of apoptosis.
TWEAK treatment abrogated radiation- and TMZinduced PARP cleavage. However, glioma cells treated
with TWEAK and TMZ or 2Gy radiation with concurrent
ATA showed elevated cleaved PARP levels compared to
cells treated with TWEAK and TMZ or radiation (Figure
5A). To further investigate if ATA could rescue TWEAKinduced glioma survival in the presence of TMZ and
radiation, we next treated cells with TWEAK and TMZ or
radiation for 24 hours in the presence or absence of ATA
and measured colony formation. Cells treated with ATA
displayed significantly impaired colony formation after
TWEAK and TMZ or radiation treatment as compared to
cells treated with TWEAK and TMZ or radiation alone
(Figure 5B and 5C). Taken together, these data validate
that ATA inhibited the pro-survival phenotype conferred
by TWEAK-Fn14 signaling following TMZ and radiation
treatment.

ATA sensitized glioma cells to TMZ and
radiation therapy
The invasive GBM cell subpopulation is radioand chemo-resistant and we have shown that TWEAK
stimulation of glioma cells in vitro suppresses apoptosis
induced by cytotoxic therapy [5, 20]. To test if ATA can
diminish the survival phenotype conferred by TWEAK,
we treated T98G, A172, and GBM44 glioma cells with
TWEAK and either TMZ or 2 Gy radiation in the presence
or absence of ATA for 48 hours and used poly ADP ribose

DISCUSSION

Fn14 depletion significantly improves glioma cell
survival in vivo

The aggressive invasion of glioma cells into the
surrounding brain parenchyma renders surgical resection
incomplete and ultimately results in tumor recurrence.
This invasive subpopulation is inherently resistant to
chemotherapy and radiation and represents a challenge
in the current clinical management of GBM. We have
demonstrated a vital role for the TWEAK-Fn14 signaling
axis in the regulation of GBM cell invasion and survival
in the presence of cytotoxic therapeutics. Thus, exploiting
or targeting TWEAK/Fn14 pathway components is an
area of active research [16, 18, 32, 33]]. TWEAK binding
to Fn14 activates the Src and Rac1 pathways that drive
GBM invasion [19, 28]. Additionally, the TWEAK-Fn14
interaction results in the upregulation of anti-apoptotic
Bcl family members and stimulates the AKT pathway to
confer chemo-and radio-resistance to cells [20, 24]. These
pro-tumorigenic phenotypes represent impediments to
the efficacy of the current standard of care, and therefore,
targeting this pathway may sensitize GBM cells to
cytotoxic therapy.
The TWEAK and Fn14 ligand-receptor pair has been
implicated in the maintenance and progression of multiple
cancers, and efforts have focused on either activating or
inhibiting this pathway [16, 18]. Preclinical and Phase I
clinical trials have tested the efficacy of agonistic anti-Fn14
or antagonistic anti-TWEAK antibodies for multiple tumor
subtypes, including breast carcinoma and melanoma [34–37].

The TWEAK-Fn14 signaling cascade induces
glioma cell invasion and survival [15, 19–21, 30].
TWEAK stimulation results in the Fn14-dependent
upregulation of BCL-xL and BCL-W proteins that confer
chemoresistant properties to GBM cells [20]. Activated
Fn14 also induces SGEF expression, which modulates the
function of the DNA damage response protein BRCA1
to augment glioma cell survival in the presence of TMZ
[21, 23]. Taken together, this data suggests that inhibition
of the TWEAK-Fn14 signaling axis may limit glioma
cell chemoresistance. To test if Fn14 depletion can act
synergistically with TMZ in vivo, we utilized the patientderived GBM44 cell line that is relatively resistant to
TMZ therapy [31]. We generated stable GBM44 cell
lines expressing a non-targeting shRNA or Fn14 shRNA,
injected the cells intracranially into athymic nude mice,
and monitored for survival in the presence or absence
of TMZ treatment. We found that Fn14 depletion in
conjunction with TMZ treatment significantly enhanced
survival when compared to TMZ treatment alone (p
< 0.0008; Figure 6A). Tumors with decreased Fn14
expression also showed significantly higher levels of
markers of apoptosis, including γH2AX and cleavedcaspase 3 (Figure 6B-6D). This data demonstrates that
inhibiting Fn14 expression, and thus function, can enhance
chemotherapeutic vulnerability in vivo.

TWEAK (100 ng/mL) in presence or absence of ATA (10 μM) for 2 min and lysed. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using TRAF2 or
IgG control antibody and then Western blot analysis was conducted using Fn14 and TRAF2 antibodies.

In most cancer cell lines, overexpression and activation of
Fn14 initiates pro-tumorigenic responses, not cell death [16,
18]. Thus, treatment with an agonistic Fn14 monoclonal
antibody may potentiate Fn14-dependent tumorigenesis.
Moreover, tumors with high expression of Fn14, including
GBM and melanoma, often express low levels of TWEAK

[15, 19, 32] (unpublished results). Fn14 overexpression may
initiate TWEAK-independent signaling and this notion of
TWEAK-independent Fn14 signaling presents a limitation
to anti-TWEAK therapy [16, 18, 38]. Therefore, a smallmolecule inhibitor that targets Fn14 or Fn14 downstream
signaling nodes may be a more effective mode of therapy.

Here we identify the compound ATA as a novel
inhibitor of TWEAK-Fn14 signaling. ATA selectively
inhibited TWEAK-Fn14-NF-κB signaling but did not
alter TNFα activation of NF-κB. Notably, ATA inhibited
TRAF2 recruitment to Fn14 after TWEAK binding, a vital
first step in the stimulation of downstream intracellular
cascades. These data suggest that ATA interferes with

an early step in the signaling process. Such possibilities
include an interaction at the receptor-ligand interface
that prevents TWEAK binding or an inhibition of ligand
induced receptor oligomerization. As such, ATA inhibited
TWEAK activation of the Src, AKT, NF-κB, and Rac1
pathways and suppresses downstream transcriptional
expression of pro-survival genes including Bcl-XL,

Figure 5: ATA suppressed TWEAK-stimulated glioma cell survival after TMZ and radiation therapy. A. T98G, A172,

and GBM44 glioma cells were treated with ATA (10 μM), TMZ (250 μM), ATA + TMZ, Radiation (2 Gy), and ATA + Radiation in presence

in 35 mm dishes and allowed to form colonies. At the end of the assay cells were fixed in PFA and stained with crystal violet, and number
of colonies were counted. Values are mean ± standard deviation of three separate measurements (**p<0.01)

Bcl-w, and SGEF (data not shown). However, ATA
treatment did not affect Fn14 or TRAF2 protein or mRNA
expression, suggesting that regulation of these proteins
is not the mechanism of action for ATA inhibition of the
TWEAK-Fn14 signaling cascade. Future studies will be
focusing on identifying the target(s) of ATA in modulating
the TWEAK-Fn14 signaling cascade, and how this
affects the DNA repair machinery after TMZ treatment.
Importantly, ATA inhibited TWEAK-stimulated glioma
cell chemotactic migration, invasion and chemoresistance.
These data demonstrate that ATA is a potent inhibitor of
the TWEAK-Fn14 signaling axis and can potentially be
utilized to enhance the therapeutic response in GBM.

Studies into the mechanism of ATA have revealed a
complex role in the regulation of signaling pathways that may
differ based on the concentration of ATA used [39–43]. In
lung carcinoma cells, ATA treatment inhibited HGF-induced
c-Met phosphorylation and subsequent cell migration [44].
Interestingly, depletion of Fn14 abrogates MET-driven
invasion in NSCLC and therefore inhibitors for both receptors
have been a proposed combination mode of therapy [45]. An
additional study identified ATA as an inhibitor of platelet
derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced signaling pathways
in neuroblastoma cells [39]. PDGF and its cognate receptors
play a vital role in the biology of GBM [46]. Therefore, ATA
may function as multi-receptor inhibitor in cancer.

Cell culture conditions

The identification of ATA as a potential therapeutic
agent for TWEAK/Fn14 –mediated GBM pathogenesis
presents a viable option to limit clinical evasiveness
of this lethal tumor. Fn14 is overexpressed in multiple
solid tumors, and therefore, its clinical utility may span
beyond GBM [16, 18, 33]. Future studies will focus
on the efficacy of ATA as part of a therapeutic regimen
in preclinical models of GBM, along with the use of
ATA chemical structure as a foundation for further
exploration of drug modification for improved GBM
therapy.

Human T98G and A172 glioma cell lines (American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained
in DMEM with high glucose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a 37°C, 5%
CO2 atmosphere at constant humidity. The primary glioma
patient derived xenograft (PDX) line GBM44 was derived
from a patient surgical sample and maintained as a flank
xenograft in immunodeficient mice [47, 48]. GBM44 flank
tumor was resected and brought to an approximate single
cell suspension via mechanical dissociation. The cells were
then maintained in DMEM with high glucose supplemented
with 10% FBS in a 37°C, 5% CO2 atmosphere at constant
humidity. In the experiments with TWEAK stimulation,
the cells were placed in serum reduced media (DMEM +
0.5% FBS) for 16 hr before stimulation with 100 ng/mL
TWEAK (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Screening of the LOPAC1280 Library
The LOPAC1280 library was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). To discover compounds
that can inhibit TWEAK-induced Fn14 signaling, the
LOPAC1280 library was screened against control and
Fn14-overexpressing HEK293 reporter cell lines that
express firefly luciferase upon NF-κB activation. These
cell lines have been described previously [25, 26].
For screening, NF-κB-Luc and NF-κB-Luc/Fn14
reporter cells were seeded in 384-well plates at 3 × 103
cells/well in 20 μL Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) and
incubated for 48 hr at 37˚C. After 48 hr incubation, 2.5
μL of each drug solution (250 μM and 500 μM stocks)
in DMSO was added to the designated wells at a final
concentration of 10 and 20 μM. After 1 hr of drug
incubation at 37˚C, 2.5 μL of recombinant TWEAK
(Peprotech Inc.; 300 ng/mL) in 0.1% BSA in PBS was
added to each well and incubated for 8 hr at 37˚C. DMSO
alone was used as a negative control whereas soluble
recombinant Fn14-Fc protein (R & D System Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN) was used as a positive control for the
assay. Luminescent signal was determined using BrightGlo assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and normalized to negative
control. Two separate counter-screen assays were carried
out using TNFα to stimulate NF-κB activity in NF-κB-Luc
and NF-κB-Luc/Fn14 reporter cells. The counter-screen
assays were performed similar to the drug screening
assay described above, except 2.5 μL of 10x purified
recombinant TNFα (R & D Systems; 300 ng/mL) in 0.1%
BSA in PBS was added to each well instead of TWEAK
for NF-κB activation. Small molecule inhibitors that
showed dose-dependent (10 μM and 20 μM) inhibition
of the luciferase signal following TWEAK stimulation
but not after TNFα stimulation were further validated by
performing a dose response analysis. The selected small
molecule inhibitors were tested at concentrations ranging
from 0.0002 μM to 100 μM for their ability to suppress
TWEAK-induced NF-κB activity in HEK293 NF-κB-Luc/
Fn14 cells.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in 2x SDS sample buffer (0.25 M
Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 25% glycerol) containing 10
μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, 20 mM NaF, 2 mM
sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride. Protein concentrations were determined using
the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin
as a standard. Thirty micrograms of total protein was
loaded per lane for SDS-PAGE. After 4°C transfer to
nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen), membranes
were blocked with either 5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA
in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Tween
20 (TBST) prior to addition of the following primary
antibodies: Fn14, phospho-NF-κB p65 (S536), NFκB p65, phospho-AKT (Y473), AKT, phospho-SRC
(Y416), SRC, cleaved PARP, α-Tubulin, and β-Actin
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and followed
with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit
IgG secondary antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were
detected using SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Thermo Scientific) with a UVP BioSpectrum
500 Imaging System (Upland, CA).

Immunoprecipitation
A172 and GBM44 cells were pre-treated with 10
μM ATA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or vehicle for
1 hr before stimulation with 100 ng/mL TWEAK for 2
min. Subsequently, cells were lysed on ice in a buffer
containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet
P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20
mM sodium fluoride, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, and 10 μg/
mL leupeptin. Equivalent amounts of protein (1 mg)

for 1 hr at 4°C, and then proteins were detected using
SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Glioma cells (5.0 × 105) were seeded in 100-mm
diameter culture dishes and incubated overnight at 37°C.
Subsequently, cells were incubated in DMEM, 0.5% FBS,
0.1% BSA for additional 16 hr at 37°C. For chemotactic
migration assays, cells were harvested and added in
triplicate to collagen-coated transwell chambers and
allowed to migrate towards TWEAK (100 ng/mL) and/
or TWEAK (100 ng/mL) and ATA (10 μM). For invasion
assays, cells were harvested, resuspended in growth factor
reduced Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) (1.0
× 105 cells/50uL), added in triplicate to collagen-coated
transwell chambers, and allowed to invade through
Matrigel towards TWEAK (100 ng/mL) and/or TWEAK
(100 ng/mL) and ATA (10 μM). After incubation for 24 hr
at 37°C, non-invaded cells were scrapped off the upper
side of the membrane and cells invaded to the other side
of the membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) and stained with ProLong® Gold Antifade reagent
with DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Nuclei of invaded
cells were counted in five high power fields (HPF) with a
20X objective.

Clonogenic assays and apoptosis studies
Observations of colony forming capacity following
cytotoxic insult were performed as described [49]. Briefly,
T98G, A172 and GBM44 cells were treated with TMZ
(500 μM) or radiation (2 Gy). In certain experiments,
cells were additionally treated concurrently with TWEAK
(100 ng/mL) or ATA (10 μM). Cells were trypsinized 24 hr
post-TMZ treatment and plated in triplicate in 6-well cell
culture dishes at 250 cells per well. Colonies were allowed
to grow (approximately 6-7 days) before being fixed
briefly in a 10% (v/v) methanol 10% (v/v) glacial acetic
acid solution, stained with a 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet
solution and washed with de-ionized water. Colonies were
counted and surviving fractions were determined relative
to the non-treated control for each cell line.
For apoptotic studies, T98G, A172, and GBM44
cells were treated with TMZ (250 μM), TWEAK (100 ng/
mL), and ATA (10 uM) for 48 hr and whole cell lysates
were analyzed for cleaved PARP by Western blot analysis.

Rac1 activation assay
Rac1 activity assays were performed according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL). Briefly, A172 and GBM44 glioma cells
(5.0 × 105) were seeded in 100-mm diameter culture
dishes and incubated overnight at 37°C. Subsequently,
cells were incubated in DMEM. 0.5% FBS, 0.1% BSA for
additional 16 hr at 37°C. Cells were then pre-incubated
with 10 μM ATA or vehicle for 1 hr prior to 10% FBS
stimulation for 2-10 min. Cell lysates were harvested and
equal concentrations of protein were assessed for Rac1
activation.

Cell viability assays
The CellTiterGlo® (Promega, San Luis Obispo,
CA) assay was used to assess the cell viability after
ATA treatment as previously described with minor
modifications [50]. Briefly, T98G, A172, and GBM44
cells were seeded at a density of 3000 cells/well (80
μL) in 96 well plates. Increasing concentrations of ATA
were added to the different wells (8 replicate wells for
each condition) and incubated for 72 hr in 37°C, 5%
CO2 atmosphere. Subsequently, CellTiterGlo® reagent
was added to each well and luminescence was measured
using Perkin Elmer Envision 2104 Multilabel Reader.
On all 96 well plates, wells containing vehicle only or
the positive control compound MG132 (a proteasome
inhibitor toxic to most cell lines at 2 μM) were also
included. Raw values were normalized on a plate-byplate basis such that 100% cell viability was equivalent
to the mean of vehicle wells and 0% cell viability was
equivalent to the mean of the MG132 positive control.
The normalized data was used to assess viability of
glioma cells after ATA treatment.

In vivo studies
Animal studies were approved by the Translational
Drug Development Management Animal Care and Use
Committee (Scottsdale, AZ). Glioma xenografts were
established in athymic mice (Taconic) as described
previously [51]. Briefly, 3 × 105 glioma cells (GBM44
glioma cells expressing control shRNA or Fn14 shRNA)
were intracranially implanted in the right striatum
of athymic mice. Mice with established tumors were
randomized into two treatment groups: vehicle control
(n = 10) and TMZ (50 mg/kg) (n = 10). Treatment was
given for 5 days through oral gavage. Mice were observed
daily and euthanized upon reaching a moribund state and
the brains were removed, rinsed, fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for 48 hours, and paraffin embedded
using routine procedures. The survival was evaluated

Immunohistochemistry
FFPE samples were sectioned using standard
procedures and adhered to charged microscope slides. Five
μM sections underwent heat induced epitope retrieval and
H&E and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of tissue
was performed using previously published procedures
[52]. Antibodies to γH2AX and cleaved caspase 3 were
purchased from Cell Signaling. Slides were scanned using
the Aperio system (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL)
and images collected at a magnification of 20×.
