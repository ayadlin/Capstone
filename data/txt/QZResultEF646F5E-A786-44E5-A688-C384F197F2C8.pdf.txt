ABSTRACT:

The molecular chaperone Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) is essential for the function
of various oncoproteins that are vital components of multiple signaling networks
regulating cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Hsp90 chaperone
function is coupled to its ATPase activity, which can be inhibited by natural products
such as the ansamycin geldanamycin (GA) and the resorcinol radicicol (RD). These
compounds have served as templates for development of numerous natural product
Hsp90 inhibitors. More recently, second generation, fully synthetic Hsp90 inhibitors,
based on a variety of chemical scaffolds, have also been synthesized. Together, 18
natural product and synthetic Hsp90 inhibitors have entered clinical trial in cancer
patients. To successfully develop Hsp90 inhibitors for oncology indications it is
important to understand the factors that influence the susceptibility of Hsp90 to these
drugs in vivo. We recently reported that Casein Kinase 2 phosphorylates a conserved
threonine residue (T22) in helix-1 of the yeast Hsp90 N-domain both in vitro and in vivo.
Phosphorylation of this residue reduces ATPase activity and affects Hsp90 chaperone
function. Here, we present additional data demonstrating that ATP binding but not
N-domain dimerization is a prerequisite for T22 phosphorylation. We also provide
evidence that T22 is an important determinant of Hsp90 inhibitor sensitivity in yeast
and we show that T22 phosphorylation status contributes to drug sensitivity in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

actively evaluated in the clinic (Table 1) [9].
Hsp90 is dimeric and each protomer can be divided
into three domains (Figure 1) [10, 11]: i) an N-terminal
domain, containing nucleotide, co-chaperone (proteins
that assist the chaperone activity of Hsp90), and drug
binding sites; ii) a middle (M) domain, which provides
binding sites for client proteins and co-chaperones; iii)
a C-terminal domain containing a dimerization motif,
a second inhibitor binding region and binding sites for
additional co-chaperones [12-14]. N and M domains
are connected by an unstructured charged-linker region
of significant but variable length, which provides
conformational flexibility to the protein [15, 16].
Hsp90 chaperone function is coupled to its ability
to bind and hydrolyze ATP, which in turn promotes an
ordered series of conformational changes known as the

Molecular chaperones are involved in protein
folding and homeostasis [1]. Hsp90 is an essential,
evolutionarily-conserved molecular chaperone that is
ubiquitously expressed both in normal and cancer cells
[2-5]. While Hsp90 has been shown to bind to and prevent
the aggregation of a wide range of proteins [6], the list of
proteins that require active chaperoning by Hsp90 is more
restricted (www.picard.ch/downloads/Hsp90interactors.
pdf), and is comprised primarily of key components of
numerous signal transduction pathways. In cancer cells,
Hsp90 plays a vital role in protecting selected mutated,
over-expressed and/or deregulated oncoproteins from
misfolding and degradation [7, 8]. Therefore it is not
surprising that multiple Hsp90 inhibitors are being

chaperone cycle that is necessary for Hsp90’s chaperone
function [17, 18]. Hsp90 inhibitors currently in clinical
evaluation all share the property of preventing the
chaperone cycle by occupying Hsp90’s N-domain ATP
binding pocket [19, 20]. The regulation of eukaryotic
Hsp90 function is complex and depends on several
factors, including the regulated interaction of specific cochaperones (e.g., Aha1 stimulates Hsp90 ATPase activity,
whereas p23/Sba1 and Hop/Sti1 inhibit ATP hydrolysis
[21, 22]), and various post-translational modifications [23,
24]. A more detailed understanding of the mechanics of
Hsp90 regulation in normal and cancer cells may provide
additional therapeutic strategies to effectively inhibit this
protein.

24], Hsp90 phosphorylation was first reported in the early
1980s [25].
Hsp90 is a substrate for several serine/threonine
and tyrosine kinases, including double-stranded DNAdependent protein kinase, Akt, B-Raf, Protein Kinase A
(PKA), Casein Kinase 2 (CK2), c-Src and Wee1 [3, 4,
26] (Table 2). These kinases are also clients of Hsp90,
suggesting the possible existence of complex feedback
loops whereby these kinases may modulate their own
chaperoning and functional activity. Indeed, others have
suggested that client binding to Hsp90 may directly
influence its chaperone activity [2, 27]. Previous work
has shown that brief exposure of cells to okadaic acid,
a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, leads to Hsp90
threonine hyperphosphorylation and is accompanied
by decreased Hsp90 association with its client kinase
v-Src [28]. These data suggest that Hsp90 threonine
phosphorylation is tightly regulated and therefore is likely
to impact chaperone function.
We reported recently that Wee1Swe1 phosphorylates
a conserved tyrosine residue (Y24 in yeast Hsp90 and
Y38 in human Hsp90α) in the N-domain of Hsp90 in a
cell cycle-dependent manner [29]. Interestingly, deletion
of Swe1 in yeast or pharmacologic inhibition of Wee1 in
cancer cells confers hypersensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition

HSP90

Hsp90 is subject to several post-translational
modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation,
and S-nitrosylation, that contribute to Hsp90 regulation,
although regulation of these processes within the cell is
not well understood [3, 4]. While Hsp90 acetylation and
S-nitrosylation have been identified more recently [23,

Figure 1: The Hsp90 chaperone cycle. Hsp90 is a dimer of two monomers, each containing an N-domain (“N”, blue); a charged

linker (“CL”, red); an M-domain (“M”, green); and a C-domain (“C”, brown). The ATP lid (purple) in the N-domain alters conformation
upon ATP binding to the N-terminal domains of the “open” conformation, promoting “lid” closure followed by transient dimerization of
the N-domains. Subsequent structural changes result in the “closed and twisted” conformation that is competent for ATP hydrolysis. The
co-chaperones Sti1 and Cdc37, and pharmacologic inhibitors such as those discussed in the text, slow or block, respectively, the chaperone
cycle at an early stage, while the co-chaperone Aha1 enhances the ATPase activity of Hsp90 by assisting the extensive and energy-intensive
conformational changes necessary to achieve competence for ATP hydrolysis. The co-chaperone p23 stabilizes a late Hsp90 conformation
and slows, but does not block, the rate of ATP hydrolysis. For more details, please see [4].

phosphorylatable alanine (T22A) did not affect its ATPase
activity, while phospho-mimetic mutation of this residue
to glutamic acid (T22E) reduced ATPase activity by 60%
compared to WT yHsp90. Nevertheless, both mutants in
yeast and the equivalent mutations in hHsp90α (T36A
and T36E) affected Hsp90-dependent chaperoning of
kinase (v-Src, Mpk1/Slt2, Raf-1, ErbB2 and CDK4) and
non-kinase (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator protein and GR) clients [33].
To explore further whether ATP binding is a
prerequisite for T22 phosphorylation, we examined the
ability of CK2 to phosphorylate two conformationally
distinct Hsp90 N-domain mutants. CK2 was able to
efficiently phosphorylate yHsp90-E33A, which binds ATP
equivalently to wild-type but, upon ATP binding, favors
a “closed” (N-domain dimerized) conformation (i.e., is
unable to hydrolyze ATP). However, CK2 was unable
to phosphorylate yHsp90-D79N, which cannot bind
ATP and thus favors an “open” (N-domain undimerized)
conformation (Figure 2A). Since T22 is not accessible
to solvent once ATP-dependent N-domain dimerization
has occurred [18], these data suggest that ATP binding
to the open conformation of Hsp90 sets in motion rapid

CK2 DEPENDENT PHOSPHORYLATION
OF HSP90
CK2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase and an
Hsp90 client [30] that phosphorylates multiple serine and
threonine residues in human Hsp90α (hHsp90α) and yeast
Hsp82 (yHsp90) [31, 32]. Recently, we used S. cerevisiae
to show that CK2 phosphorylates a single conserved
threonine residue (T22) in the N-domain of yHsp90 both
in vitro and in vivo [33]. T22 resides in helix-1 of the
Hsp90 N-domain that, together with other adjacent amino
acids, is involved in an important hydrophobic interaction
with the ATPase catalytic loop in the M-domain that helps
to establish Hsp90’s ATP hydrolysis-competent state.
The functional importance of T22 was uncovered
initially in a genetic screen, where its mutation to
isoleucine affected the chaperoning of v-Src and
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in yeast [34]. Subsequent
work demonstrated that the T22I mutant has 6-fold
higher ATPase activity compared to WT yHsp90 [35].
In contrast, we have shown that mutation of T22 to non-

conformational change within and adjacent to helix-1
that is a prerequisite for CK2-mediated phosphorylation.
Indeed, a recent study of the bacterial ortholog of Hsp90,
HtpG, confirms that this region of the N-domain undergoes
very rapid conformational change upon ATP binding
that significantly precedes ATP-induced N-domain
dimerization [35, 36] Since T22 phosphorylation slows the
rate of ATP hydrolysis without affecting ATP binding, it is
possible that eukaryotic cells utilize this post-translational
modification to adjust the rate of the Hsp90 cycle to meet
the optimal chaperone requirements of individual client
proteins.
We showed previously that phosphorylation of Y24
is a signal for Hsp90 polyubiquitination and degradation
by cytoplasmic proteasomes [33]. We explored the
possibility that T22 phosphorylation of yHsp90 may serve
a similar purpose. Yeast expressing WT Hsp90 as well as
the phospho mutants (T22A and T22E) were treated with
the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (50 µM for 1h). This
resulted in equivalent accumulation of polyubiquitinated

yHsp90 in each case (Figure 2B). Therefore, unlike Y24,
T22 phosphorylation is not likely to be a determinant of
Hsp90 degradation. Instead, one can speculate that T22
phosphorylation occurs dynamically to allow for the finetuning of chaperone activity in response to environmental
cues.

compromise its chaperone function, or Hsp90 inhibitor
administration, lead to strong induction of Hsf1 activity in
yeast, even in the absence of heat shock [38].
To examine the importance of T22 in Hsp90
modulation of the heat shock response, we measured Hsf1
activity in yHsp90 T22A (normal ATPase activity), T22E
(reduced ATPase activity) and T22I (elevated ATPase
activity)-expressing yeast cells by transforming them
with a heat shock element HSE-lacZ reporter plasmid. We
confirmed that yHsp90-T22I displayed a higher basal and
heat-induced (39˚C for 40 min) Hsf1 activity compared
to WT cells [39] (Figure 3B), while Hsf1 activity
was significantly diminished in the phospho-mimetic
yHsp90-T22E mutant. At the same time, Hsf1 activity
in yHsp90-T22A mutant yeast was equivalent to that of
yeast expressing WT yHsp90. These data suggest that the
ability of yHsp90 to regulate Hsf1 closely parallels its
inherent ATPase activity, but that temperature sensitivity
itself is not an accurate predictor of the impact of these
Hsp90 mutations on the heat shock response.

There are currently 18 Hsp90 inhibitors in various
stages of clinical evaluation as targeted anti-cancer agents.
Uncovering modifications to Hsp90 that might enhance
sensitivity to these inhibitors at the cellular level would
certainly aid their continued clinical development. To that
end, we have examined the sensitivity of T22 mutants
to Hsp90 inhibitors. We expressed non-phospho (T22A)
and phospho-mimetic (T22E) Hsp90 mutants, as well as
yHsp90-T22I, as the sole Hsp90 species in the PP30 yeast
strain lacking the pleiotropic drug resistance pump, Pdr5
[40, 41]. Although the S. cerevisiae genome contains 30
plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins
[42], Pdr5 has been identified as the major mediator of
Hsp90 inhibitor efflux [40, 41].
Yeast cells were grown to exponential phase and
were spotted at 107, 106 and 105 cells/ml on YPDA plates

Our data show that the drug sensitivity of y-Hsp90-T22Aexpressing yeast was equivalent to or less than that of
yeast expressing WT yHsp90. In contrast, yeast expressing
yHsp90-T22I were uniformly hypersensitive to all of the
Hsp90 inhibitors examined (Figure 4A, B). Interestingly,
yeast expressing the phospho-mimetic yHsp90-T22E
were also more sensitive than either WT or yHsp90-T22Aexpressing yeast to the four Hsp90 inhibitors (Figure 4A,
B). However, this increased sensitivity was evident only
at higher drug concentrations. These data identify T22 as
an important determinant of Hsp90 inhibitor sensitivity
in yeast and suggest that T22 phosphorylation status may
contribute to drug sensitivity in vivo.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

REFERENCES

Hsp90 phosphorylation has been known for nearly
30 years [25], however only recently are we beginning to
appreciate its significance in fine-tuning Hsp90 chaperone
activity [4]. Our recent work has demonstrated that the
Hsp90 client kinase CK2 phosphorylates a conserved
threonine residue (T22) in the N-domain of yHsp90.
This residue participates in a hydrophobic interaction
with lysine 378 of the catalytic loop in the Hsp90 middle
domain, helping to stabilize the ATPase-competent state
induced by ATP binding to the N-domain. Phosphomimetic mutation of this residue in both yeast and human
Hsp90 alters chaperone function (see Figure 5 and [33]).
Here, we have provided additional data showing that
mutation of this residue impacts both the heat shock
response and sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors.
It is unlikely that the regulation of Hsp90 function,
in all its complexity, is universal for all client proteins of
this chaperone. Indeed, a recent report [2] has suggested
that different clients and co-chaperone complexes
can be accommodated by subtly different Hsp90
conformational states. Perhaps phosphorylation of Hsp90,
