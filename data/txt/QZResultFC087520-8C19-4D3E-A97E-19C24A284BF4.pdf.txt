ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer treatment remains a challenge and targeting cancer stem cells
presents a promising strategy. Niclosamide is an “old” antihelminthic drug that
uncouples mitochondria of intestinal parasites. Although recent studies demonstrated
that niclosamide could be a potential anticancer agent, its poor water solubility needs
to be overcome before further preclinical and clinical investigations can be conducted.
Therefore, we evaluated a novel nanosuspension of niclosamide (nano-NI) for its
effect against ovarian cancer. Nano-NI effectively inhibited the growth of ovarian
cancer cells in which it induced a metabolic shift to glycolysis at a concentration of
less than 3 μM in vitro and suppressed tumor growth without obvious toxicity at an
oral dose of 100 mg/kg in vivo. In a pharmacokinetic study after oral administration,
nano-NI showed rapid absorption (reaching the maximum plasma concentration
within 5 min) and improved the bioavailability (the estimated bioavailability for oral
nano-NI was 25%). In conclusion, nano-NI has the potential to be a new treatment
modality for ovarian cancer and, therefore, further clinical trials are warranted.

INTRODUCTION

also showed a limited improvement in progression-free
survival (PFS) [7–9]. Therefore, there is an urgent need
to develop novel, effective, and safe agents for ovarian
cancer treatment.
Targeting cancer stem cells is an emerging concept
in cancer therapy [10]. Ovarian cancer stem cells play an
important role in chemoresistance and cancer recurrence
[11]. In particular, several “old drugs” have been used in
drug repurposing studies to inhibit cancer cell growth by
altering the metabolic pathways of cancer cells [12, 13].
We previously used a cancer stem cell-based drug
screening platform to demonstrate that niclosamide, an old
and safe antihelminthic drug, inhibits the growth of tumorinitiating cells by modulating their metabolic signaling
pathways [14, 15]. Furthermore, recent studies indicate

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic
malignancy in the world [1]. Most patients undergo
cytoreductive surgery and receive a combination of
paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy. However,
numerous patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage
and, therefore, have a poor prognosis due to distant
metastases and chemoresistance [2]. Although paclitaxel
represents a breakthrough in the treatment of ovarian
cancer, the overall 5-year survival rate of patients
with stage III disease is still approximately 40% [2–4].
Furthermore, the inclusion of targeted therapy for ovarian
cancer offers limited therapeutic advantages [5, 6]. The

that niclosamide exhibits anticancer effects against various
human cancer cells by acting on multiple cell signaling
pathways and inducing mitochondrial uncoupling [16–21].
Therefore, niclosamide is considered an “old drug” with
potential for inclusion in new multitargeted therapy for
cancer [17].
Niclosamide has a poor water solubility of 0.23 µg/mL
[22] and, therefore, has low systemic bioavailability
(~10%) when administered orally, which is beneficial for
treating local parasitic infections of the intestines while
minimizing systemic exposure [22]. However, poor
solubility is an obstacle to the further clinical development
of niclosamide as a novel anticancer drug. One approach
to improving drug solubility is a chemical modification,
and several water-soluble niclosamide derivatives have
been synthesized [23]. However, these derivatives
are new chemical entities that require comprehensive
preclinical and clinical studies to confirm their efficacy
and safety. Another approach is to reduce the particle size
of an approved drug by using emerging nanotechnology
[24–27]. This formulation-based approach is believed
to streamline the drug development process because the
pharmacological and toxicological profiles are already
known. We have successfully fabricated a nanosuspension
of niclosamide (nano-NI) with a greatly enhanced aqueous
dissolution rate, owing to its significantly reduced
particle size [28]. The novel nano-NI could have clinical
applications in the treatment of ovarian cancer; however,
before clinical studies, preclinical efficacy, toxicity, and
pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic studies are
required.
In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo
activity and toxicity of nano-NI in cell and animal
models as well as the effects of the novel formulation on
water solubility and ovarian cell metabolism. Then, we
determined the oral bioavailability and pharmacological
effects of the new formulation. The information obtained
from the present study should provide a foundation for
future clinical investigations.

SKOV3 cells were treated with the nano-NI and original
niclosamide formulations for 72 h. Nano-NI was found
to be significantly more cytotoxic to ovarian cancer
cells than the original form was, with IC50 values of 3.59
and 3.38  μM for CP70 and SKOV3 cells, respectively
(Figure  1B). The nano-NI demonstrated significantly
higher inhibitory effects on sphere formation than the
original niclosamide did (Figure 1C and 1D).

Nano-NI disrupts ovarian cancer cell metabolism
To explore the mechanism underlying the nanoNI-induced alteration of the ovarian cancer cell metabolic
phenotype, we measured glucose consumption in ovarian
cancer cell lines. The glucose consumption by the control
and nano-NI groups was 25 ±  7 and 50 ±  0.57 mg/dL,
respectively in CP70 cells and 10 ± 1.7 and 27.7 ± 3.2 mg/dL,
respectively, in SKOV3 cells (Figure 2A). The nano-NI-treated
group cells took up more glucose than control cells did. To
determine whether nano-NI affected ovarian cancer cell
energy production, we performed an ATP production assay
with or without nano-NI treatment. The nano-NI decreased
ATP production by 37 and 34% in CP70 and SKOV3 cells,
respectively (Figure 2B). The increased uptake of glucose with
decreased ATP production after nano-NI treatment suggests
that the cancer cells shifted to an inefficient energy production
mode. To assess the effect of nano-NI on the ovarian
cancer cell metabolic shift, we used a flux analyzer (XF24
Extracellular Flux Analyzer, Seahorse Bioscience, North
Billerica, MA, USA) to measure the oxygen consumption
rate (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of
the control and nano-NI-treated groups. The ovarian cancer
cells treated with nano-NI showed a decrease in the OCR
and a compensatory increase in the ECAR in both CP70
and SKOV3 cells (Figure 2C–2E). The shift from oxidative
phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis was observed in both
ovarian CP70 and SKOV3 cancer cell lines (Figure 2F). In
summary, the nano-NI formulation decreased the metabolic
activity of ovarian cancer cells and caused a metabolic shift
from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis.

To further assess the efficiency of nano-NI in
targeting ovarian cancer in vivo, we used non-obese
diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mice in a xenograft experiment in which
each group of mice was injected with 106 tumor
cells intraperitoneally. Nano-NI (100 mg/kg) was
administered via oral gavage five times a week.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan analysis of
the tumor growth after 2 weeks of treatment showed
significant differences between the control and drugtreated groups (Figure 3A). The mean standardized
uptake value (SUV) of the nano-NI-treated group was

In the present study, a colloid dispersion of
nanosized NI in PBS stabilized with 1% polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA), was prepared using an electrospray procedure [28].
While the coarse suspension of the original niclosamide
was turbid, the nano-NI colloidal dispersion was almost
transparent, with a yellowish color (Figure 1A). The
scanning electron microscope images revealed the
nanosuspension morphology, with an average particle
diameter and length of 105 ±  21 and 493 ±  151 nm

significantly lower than that of the CP70 cell control
group was (0.32 ± 0.14 mg/dL and 0.91 ± 0.24 mg/dL,
respectively, Figure 3B). The values were consistent
with those obtained in SKOV3 cells, which were
0.20  ±  0.11 and 0.83 ±  0.13 in the oral nano-NI and
PBS-treated control groups, respectively. The mice were

euthanized 3–4 weeks after the experiment commenced.
The tumor sizes are shown in Figure 3C while the
tumor weights of the treatment group were significantly
reduced (Figure 3D). Therefore, we demonstrated the
efficacy of a new oral nanomedicine in an ovarian
cancer model.

from the vital organs (the brain, kidney, intestine, and
liver) revealed no damage in either group (Figure 4G).
In addition to these tests, there were no significant
differences in blood cell counts, hemoglobin, and
platelet counts between the control and nano-NI groups

(Supplementary Figure S1). This toxicity evaluation
showed that oral nano-NI had no toxic effect on either
group of mice in terms of weight, plasma albumin levels,
and blood cell counts, and revealed no adverse effects on
vital organ function in the rodents, which suggests that
nano-NI is safe for animals.

(5 min), followed by a fast distribution phase. The data
indicate that the absorption of niclosamide was rapid
such that the absorption phase, typically observed in the
pharmacokinetic profile following the oral administration
of drugs, was not observed. To verify the peak absorption
time, an additional pharmacokinetic study was conducted
with more intensive sampling at early time points. The
peak appeared again at the first sampling time at 1 min
(for both oral and IV routes, Supplementary Figure S2),
suggesting that the drug reached the systemic circulation
almost instantaneously following oral administration
of the solution. It is interesting to note that the plasma
concentration peaked right after the distribution phase at
4 h for both the oral and IV routes (Figure 5). This finding
was consistent with that of a previous study in mice [16].
Considering that a second peak was also observed with
the IV route, this phenomenon may be attributable to an
enterohepatic recycling mechanism [29]. As shown in
Figure 5, the mean area under the concentration-time curve
(AUC) was calculated to be 669.5 and 1058 h/(ng∙mL)
for the oral and IV routes, respectively. Therefore, the
estimated bioavailability for oral niclosamide was 25%.

use in cancer treatment was described previously, and
successful examples include sodium stibogluconate. This
drug has been used for nearly 60 years to treat visceral
leishmaniasis in humans and was considered druggable for
combined use with interferon in cancer therapy in a phase I
study [30]. Other successful examples are the antimalarial
drug artesunate, which has proven effective in treating
human renal cell carcinoma alone or in combination with
other therapeutic agents [31]. Successful translation of
repurposed drugs for clinical use requires thorough in vitro
and in vivo preclinical investigations. Moreover, during
the drug development process, it is essential to understand
the physicochemical properties of a new molecular
entity and to develop a suitable formulation for drug
administration and delivery. Similar to drugs discovered
through traditional pathways, a repurposed “old” drug may
face some formulation problems that need to be addressed.
The drug niclosamide was approved for intestinal
parasite infection and has low water solubility and
oral bioavailability. The drug has been found to exert
growth inhibitory effects against many cancer cells by
acting on multiple pathways of cancer cell metabolism.
Previously, we showed the potential anti-ovarian cancer
activity of niclosamide. In the present study, for the
first time we report the preclinical efficacy, toxicity, and
pharmacokinetic properties of an orally administered
niclosamide nanosuspension (nano-NI) for ovarian
cancer treatment. Our findings indicate that nanoniclosamide suppressed ovarian cancer cell growth more
efficiently than the original form did in vitro and inhibited
energy production in ovarian cancer cells, leading to a
functionally altered metabolic phenotype. Furthermore,

DISCUSSION
Considering the widespread incidences of drug
resistance and toxicity, as well as selectivity for anticancer
therapy, old drugs remain a strong potential source of
alternative agents for cancer therapy. Recently, drugrepurposing studies have presented a promising strategy
for discovering new therapeutic agents for cancer
treatment. The concept of repurposing existing drugs for

our data also show that oral administration of nano-NI
inhibits ovarian tumor growth with minor hepatic and
renal toxicity in mice. In addition, nano-NI exhibits
improved oral bioavailability of niclosamide.
Nanotechnology is an area of science devoted
to manipulating particle size to obtain particles in the
nanometer scale range of 1–100 nm (or sometimes
up to 1000 nm). Nanosized materials have unique
physicochemical properties such as a large surface
area to mass ratio as well as high permeability and
solubility, which can be used to overcome the limitations
of traditional therapeutic and diagnostic agents [32].
Recently, nanodrug delivery systems (nano-DDS) have
been extensively studied to improve cancer treatment [33].
Nano-DDS currently in clinical use include liposomes,
nanoemulsions, lipid nanocarriers, and micelles [34].
Liposomal doxorubicin is the best-known nanoparticle
formulation for metastatic ovarian cancer therapy. For
solid tumor treatment, higher tumor accumulation is
anticipated with nanoparticles because of the enhanced
permeation and retention effect caused by the leaky
nature of the tumor vasculature [35]. Although liposomal
doxorubicin offers an advantage of reduced cardiac
toxicity, its use is limited by neurotoxicity and hand-foot
syndrome [36, 37]. In addition, liposomal doxorubicin has
technological and manufacturing issues that limit its largescale production and supply [38]. The use of the liposomal
formulations is still limited owing to the possible
promotion of tumor angiogenesis and inhibition of tumor
immunologic response [39]. In this study, a directly
fabricated nano-NI in PBS was investigated without an
adjuvant, which may be safer for clinical application.
Several cosolvents have been used to formulate
niclosamide solutions including polyethylene glycol
(PEG), cremophor, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
[16–18, 40]. All of these cosolvents show dose-dependent
toxicities. For example, a recent report revealed that the
long-term uptake of DMSO results in brain degeneration
and widespread apoptosis in the developing central
nervous system [41]. Previous studies on the oral
administration of niclosamide successfully proved that it
has antitumor activity against colon cancer in vivo, but
the studies were not without limitations. In the present
study, we found that nano-NI could be dispersed in
the PBS-based dosing solution without the addition of
organic solvents. The nano-NI overcame the poor watersolubility of niclosamide by minimizing its particle size,
thereby increasing the surface area of the original powder
without altering its chemical structure [25]. The reduced
use of a nonaqueous solvent is advantageous for further
developing clinically acceptable formulations. Our nanoNI with a nanosized suspension in PBS is a pure agent
without cosolvent toxicity.
To improve the treatment of ovarian cancer, it
is important to include new anticancer drugs that show
less toxicity, increased ease of production, and can be

administered orally to the currently available treatment
options. Niclosamide may be a next-generation antiovarian cancer drug because it targets cancer cell
metabolism and has a good safety profile. The drug is used
for treating parasitic intestinal infections; therefore, its site
of action after oral administration is in the intestine. Its
low aqueous solubility and poor oral bioavailability are
advantageous for its antiparasitic effect. Moreover, the
nanosized drug may exhibit better oral bioavailability. In
the present study, the oral bioavailability of our nano-NI
solution was 25%, which is a significant improvement over
the reported value of 10% [23]. However, as a potential
drug for ovarian cancer treatment, the bioavailability of
niclosamide needs to be improved, and its pharmacokinetic
properties, as well as efficacy and toxicity in the context of
improved absorption, should be characterized.
Considering the unique biology of cancer cells,
targeting their metabolism may be a possible therapeutic
strategy [41, 42]. Metabolism comprises the various
cellular chemical reactions that sustain life and is different
in cancer cells from that in normal cells. Therefore,
metabolism and could be a useful therapeutic target
[43]. For example, metformin and statins have been
associated with improved survival in cancer, which may
be attributed to their effects on glycolytic pathways and
lipid metabolism of cancer cells, respectively [12, 44–46].
In this study, the metabolic interruption induced by nanoNI may be one of the mechanisms underlying its effects
against ovarian cancer.
Niclosamide is approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) as an antihelminthic drug and
has been recently investigated for use in cancer therapy.
Fundamentally, the mechanism of action of niclosamide
involves uncoupling of the mitochondria of target cells.
The mitochondrion is vital for cellular bioenergetics and
plays a central role in the apoptotic process. Several lines
of evidence indicate that niclosamide inhibits tumor cell
growth by interrupting multiple pathways (Wnt, Notch,
STAT3, NF-κB, and mTORc1) and the generation of
reactive oxygen species in several cancer cells [16–18,
42–44]. Therefore, metabolic intervention by old drugs
could be a new approach to cancer therapy [45–47].
From the clinical point of view, cancer metabolism has
been proposed as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer
[48, 49]. In a previous study, we showed that niclosamide
downregulates several essential metabolism-associated
genes, and we proposed that it could inhibit ovarian
cancer cells by interfering with metabolic pathways [14].
In the present study, we show that nano-NI changed the
phosphorylation-to-glycolysis ratio of cancer cells, and
suppressed tumor growth, thereby providing evidence
supporting interference with metabolism as a potential
approach to therapy. Cancer cells possess a unique
metabolic status known as the Warburg effect, which
depends on aerobic glycolysis and diverges significantly
from that of normal cells [50]. The metabolic alteration

in tumor cells may confer sensitivity to some targeted
therapies and chemotherapeutic agents [50, 51]. Therefore,
our results support the testing of a combination of nano-NI
with these agents to improve cancer therapy.
The incorporation of this nanosuspension of an
old drug into current chemotherapy guidelines is a
challenge. The current standard therapy for ovarian cancer
includes taxanes and platinum-based chemotherapy after
cytoreductive surgery. Among treated patients, nearly 70
to 80% will experience disease recurrence [2, 52]. For
patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer,
chemotherapy with combined paclitaxel-carboplatin has
been shown to lead to a longer overall survival (OS)
than with platinum alone, but with more side effects
[52]. Combination therapy in patients with platinumsensitive recurrent ovarian cancer using carboplatin
and gemcitabine, with or without bevacizumab, may
prolong progression-free survival (PFO), but not OS
[53, 54]. For patients with platinum-resistant ovarian
cancer, the use of single agents such as the taxanes has
only a 22% response rate while pegylated liposomal
doxorubicin and gemcitabine may have a response
rate of 33% [55, 56]. Combined chemotherapy may
not prolong OS due to incidences of more side effects
than occurs with single-agent chemotherapy in patients
with platinum-resistance. Owing to its safety following
oral use, the future application of nano-NI combined
with other chemotherapeutic agents may warrant
further investigation. In the future, designs of clinical
trials using nano-NI alone or in combination with
other chemotherapeutic agents will lead to the clinical
application of this newly formulated old drug.
In conclusion, the newly developed nanosuspension
of niclosamide without adjuvants was water soluble,
effective, and safe in this preclinical study. Therefore,
future clinical evaluation is warranted.

The setup of the single-capillary electrospray system
has been described previously [28]. For the electrospray
processing, a stock solution of niclosamide was prepared
by dissolving 5 mg in 2.5 mL of a cosolvent (acetonitrile/
DMSO, 1/4, v/v). The collection substrate was a petri dish
filled with PBS solution containing 1% (w/v) polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) as a stabilizer (i.e., 1:1 mixture of a 2% [w/v]
PVA solution and 2 × PBS solution). The capillary tube and
collection substrate were approximately 3 cm apart, and the
applied voltage ranged from 5 to 7 kV. The collection time
was approximately 13.5 h, during which a nanosuspension
containing a maximum niclosamide concentration of
455.8 μg/mL could be obtained. The electrospray modes of
the system were monitored by viewing the liquid meniscus at
the exit of the capillary tube. The meniscus was illuminated
with a diffusing light, and its shape was observed using a
microscope system that consisted of a microscope lens
(Retro Zoom 65, Model: 30–43–10), a digital camera (STC620PWT, Sentech), and a high-resolution monitor. The
spray jet was recorded using a computer. The solvents were
evaporated during the electrospray process. The prepared
nano-NI formulations were further diluted to the desired
concentrations for use in subsequent cell and animal studies.
The UV-visible spectrum indicated that the previously
described organic solvents used for producing the nanoNI were almost completely evaporated during electrospray
processing (Supplementary Figure S3).

Cell proliferation and chemosensitivity assay
CP70 and SKOV3 cell viabilities were detected
using the MTS cell proliferation assay (Promega). Briefly,
CP70 and SKOV3 (1000 cells each) were seeded in
96-well plates containing 100 μL media/well overnight.
Then, they were exposed to nano-NI or niclosamide for
72 h. The MTS solution was prepared from the CellTiter
96R aqueous MTS reagent powder and kept at –20°C for
long-term storage, and at 4°C away from light before use.
Next, 20 μL of the MTS solution was added to each well,
where the viable cells generated soluble formazan. After
an incubation period of 45 to 60  min, the fluorescence
absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a 96-well
microplate reader (BioTek). Each reaction was assayed at
least thrice. The results are expressed as the ratio of the
absorbance of each sample to that of the untreated samples
with media alone. The proliferation assays were performed
in triplicate. All in vitro studies were conducted in triplicate
in two independent experiments in the different cell lines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Two human ovarian cancer cell lines were used in
this study. They were the SKOV3, which was purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,

Laboratory (University of Texas Health Science Center,
San Antonio TX, USA). CP70 and SKOV-3 cells were
maintained as monolayer cultures in RPMI-1640 medium
(Biological Industries Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Gibco), 0.1% NaHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich),
0.1% N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2'-ethanesulfonic
acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% non-essential amino acids
(NEAA), 1% sodium pyruvate, and 0.1% penicillinstreptomycin (all from Biological Industries Inc.) at 37°C
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. SKOV3 and CP70 cells were
passaged every 3 days for a maximum of 20 passages.

(DMEM) plus GlutaMAX™-I containing 5% FBS suitable
for use with human embryonic stem cells (ESCs, Biological

concentrations of niclosamide for 7 days. The cell culture
was examined daily for sphere formation.

3 μM. The OCR reading represented the OCR, whereas
the ECAR reflected lactate production and was used as an
index of glycolysis.

Xenograft test and positron emission
tomography (PET) scan analysis
All procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Defense
Medical Center. Female NOD/SCID mice were purchased
from the Laboratory Animal Center of the National
Taiwan University College of Medicine with health
reports confirming that they were free from contamination.
Next, 1 × 106 CP70 and SKOV3 cells were inoculated
intraperitoneally. Three days later, 100 mg/kg nano-NI was
administered to each experimental group, and the same
volume of PBS was administered to the control group
of NOD/SCID mice five times a week. After 2  weeks
of treatment, both groups (n = 4) of NOD/SCID mice
and a negative control group (n = 3) were injected with
0.20–0.25 mCi (7.4–9.25 MBq) of [18F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoroD-glucose ([18F]-FDG) via the tail vein.[57] After 30 min
to allow the distribution of the [18F]-FDG injection, the
mice were anesthetized, and animal PET statistic scanning
with BIOPET105 (Bioscan, Inc., Washington DC, USA)
was performed. The PET images were acquired for 30 min,
and the energy window was set at 250–700 keV. The
3D-ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM)
was used to reconstruct the images. The entire imaging
procedure was performed in the basement of the National
Defense Medical Center Laboratory Animal Center,
which is certified by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International
(AAALAC 2007). Imaging data were analyzed using the
AMIDE software v1.0.4 [58]. The tumor volume was
quantitated by calculating the SUV, which represents the
levels of the [18F]-FDG in a volume of interest (typically
of a focal tumor) relative to the average [18F]-FDG levels
in the entire body, detected using animal-PET statistic
scanning. The experiment lasted for 3–4 weeks. When the
tumor size reached 1.5 cm in diameter in each group, all
of the mice were euthanized (approximately 2 weeks after
the animal PET scan). The tumor tissue was collected,
weighed, and the vital organs including the liver, brain,
and kidneys were collected for hematoxylin and eosin
(H & E) staining.

Glucose consumption assay
The CP70 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines
were seeded at a density of 3 ×  105 cells per well in
24-well plates with fresh culture medium. Nano-NI was
added to each well to obtain a final concentration of 3 μM
in each well. The cell viability was also evaluated using
the CyQUANT cell proliferation kit assay (Invitrogen),
which measures the cellular DNA content via fluorescent
dye binding. First, we ensured that the cells were alive for
0 to 4 h (Supplementary Figure S4). The culture medium
was collected after 2 and 4 h to check the glucose level
under each condition. Fresh medium alone was used in
the control group. The glucose level was measured at the
Union Clinical Laboratory, Taipei, Taiwan (certified by the
College of American Pathologists). Glucose consumption
was expressed as the glucose level of the original medium
minus that of the sample.

ATP production assay
The CP70 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines
were seeded at a density of 2 ×  103 cells per well in a
96-well plate in fresh culture medium. Next, following a
scheduled time course, we added the nano-NI to each well
to obtain a final concentration of 3 μM in the test wells.
Then, the luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega)
was used to collect the supernatant for laminator analysis,
the measurements were performed after 15 min using a
microplate reader, and then calculated using the Gen5
software (BioTek).

Oxygen consumption rate and glycolysis
(extracellular acidification rate) test using XF24
Mitochondrial respiration in the CP70 and SKOV3
ovarian cancer cell lines was assessed using a Seahorse
XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience,
North Billerica, MA, USA). The CP70 and SKOV3 cells
were cultured on Seahorse XF24 plates at a density of
2 × 103 cells/well. Each well was filled with unbuffered
RPMI medium at pH 7.4 and incubated at 37°C before the
start of the experiment. Baseline measurements of OCR
were performed using the oxygen concentration change
while the ECAR was measured using the pH change before
the wells were injected with nano-NI (final concentration
of 3 μM). These agents were injected through the ports of
the Seahorse flux pak cartridges to a final concentration of

Mouse blood analysis
After 4 weeks, all the mice were euthanized for
the analysis of blood biochemistry and tumor sampling.
Whole blood was collected via heart puncture, and all of
the samples were stored at < 4°C on ice for biochemical
analysis. Each whole blood sample (200 μL, n = 3) was
collected in a K2 EDTA tube via heart puncture after the
mice were euthanized. Blood serum was sent for analyses

Pharmacokinetic animal study

Authors’ contributions

The surgical procedure used here was as described
previously [59]. Briefly, female Sprague-Dawley rats were
purchased from BioLASCO Taiwan Co. (Taipei, Taiwan,
Republic of China) and guaranteed to be specific pathogen
free. All the rats were bred and maintained under a 12-h
light-dark cycle at a temperature of 21 ±  2°C. Female
rats weighing 220–250 g were anesthetized with an
intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg).
Polyethylene catheters were implanted into the right jugular
vein and left carotid artery, and the distal end of the catheter
was externalized through an incision in the skin on the
back of the neck for drug injection and blood withdrawal
(Supplementary Figure S5). The cannulated animals were
allowed to recover under normal conditions overnight.
The nano-NI was dispersed in PBS (0.46 mg/mL),
and administered to rats by oral gavage or IV (5 or 2 mg/kg).
The blood samples (150 mL) were collected via the jugular
vein cannula at 0 (immediately before dosing) 1, 3, 5, 10,
15, and 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h (n = 3 and
5 in the IV and oral groups, respectively). Plasma samples
were collected by centrifugation (1500 g for 15 min at 4°C)
and stored at –20°C until the LC-MS/MS analysis was
performed (Supplementary information section for details).
The AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf) was calculated
as follows: AUC0-inf = AUC0-t + Ct/ λ, where AUC0-t is
the AUC from time 0 to the last sampling time (t), which
is calculated using the trapezoidal rule; Ct/ λ is the AUC
extrapolated from t to infinity and λ is the terminal rate
constant estimated by linear regression to the terminal loglinear portion of the pharmacokinetic profile [29]. Both the
oral and IV AUCs (AUCPO and AUCIV, respectively) were
calculated, and the absolute oral bioavailability (F) was
estimated as follows: F (%) = (AUCPO/AUCIV) × (DoseIV/
DosePO) × 100.
