for iron than healthy cells because they rapidly proliferate.
Exposure of cancer cells to some iron chelators has been shown
to elicit a G1-S cell cycle arrest (6, 7). The R2 subunit of
ribonucleotide reductase, a primarily S-phase protein, is dependent
on iron supply for its stabilization with the R1 subunit and the
subsequent activity of ribonucleotide reductase (8). Within serum,
iron is transported by the protein transferrin and taken up by cells
via binding of transferrin to transferrin receptor 1 (9). Cancer cells
show increased uptake and utilization of iron by virtue of
possessing significantly higher levels of transferrin receptor 1 than
healthy cells (10). These unique characteristics of neoplastic cells
have been exploited recently by the use of iron chelators that show
significant antitumor activity in vitro and in animal models (11, 12).
Targeting iron metabolism has resulted in compounds with some
antitumor activity such as desferrioxamine (desferal or desferrioxamine; refs. 13, 14) and dexrazoxane (ICRF-187; refs. 15, 16) when
used in combination with doxorubicin. The iron chelator
dexrazoxane (ICRF-187), a cell-permeable cyclic derivative of
EDTA, is Food and Drug Administration approved for reducing
the incidence and severity of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy
in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a
cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2, but it has no
appreciable antitumor activity of its own (17). Our previous work
and that of others have shown desferrioxamine to be capable of
inhibiting breast tumor growth without interfering with tumoricidal activity of doxorubicin (14). However, the short half-life and
low membrane permeability of desferrioxamine limit its antitumor
activity in clinical settings (18). Other newer iron chelators,
tachypyridine and triapine, are currently being evaluated for
antitumor activity in the clinic (19, 20).
A range of iron chelating di-2-pyridyl thiosemicarbazone
analogues have been developed (14) with greater cytotoxic and
iron chelating activities than desferrioxamine (21). One analogue,
di-2-pyridylketone-4,4,-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT),
was proposed to have selective antitumor activity in vitro and
in vivo (structure, Fig. 1A, inset; ref. 12). In previous studies,
Dp44mT as a single agent was capable of inducing apoptosis in
neuroepithelioma, melanoma, and breast cancer cells in contrast to
healthy fibroblasts. It also showed activity in etoposide (VP-16)–
resistant clones of MCF-7 breast and KB3-1 epidermoid carcinoma
cells. Short-term studies with low-dose Dp44mT have inhibited
lung, melanoma, and neuroepithelioma tumor growth in nude mice
without systemic iron depletion, changes in organ weights, or
differences in serum biochemical parameters, in contrast to
triapine (12). We are interested in understanding the activity and
mechanism of action of Dp44mT to determine whether it might
serve as a therapeutic adjunct to doxorubicin treatment of breast
cancer. Given the antitumor activity of Dp44mT by itself, we tested

Abstract
Di-2-pyridylketone-4,4,-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT)
is being developed as an iron chelator with selective
anticancer activity. We investigated the mechanism whereby
Dp44mT kills breast cancer cells, both as a single agent and
in combination with doxorubicin. Dp44mT alone induced
selective cell killing in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231
when compared with healthy mammary epithelial cells
(MCF-12A). It induces G1 cell cycle arrest and reduces cancer
cell clonogenic growth at nanomolar concentrations. Dp44mT,
but not the iron chelator desferal, induces DNA double-strand
breaks quantified as S139 phosphorylated histone foci
(;-H2AX) and Comet tails induced in MDA-MB-231 cells.
Doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity and DNA damage were both
enhanced significantly in the presence of low concentrations
of Dp44mT. The chelator caused selective poisoning of DNA
topoisomerase IIA (top2A) as measured by an in vitro DNA
cleavage assay and cellular topoisomerase-DNA complex
formation. Heterozygous Nalm-6 top2A knockout cells
(top2A+/ ) were partially resistant to Dp44mT-induced cytotoxicity compared with isogenic top2A+/+ or top2B / cells.
Specificity for top2A was confirmed using top2A and top2B
small interfering RNA knockdown in HeLa cells. The results
show that Dp44mT is cytotoxic to breast cancer cells, at least in
part, due to selective inhibition of top2A. Thus, Dp44mT may
serve as a mechanistically unique treatment for cancer due to
its dual ability to chelate iron and inhibit top2A activity.

Introduction
Iron chelators have historically been studied for treatment of
iron overload disease and for their potential to alleviate the
cardotoxic side effects of anthracycline chemotherapy (1, 2). The
essential nature of elemental iron is evident in a multitude of
cellular processes including proliferation, DNA synthesis, mitochondrial electron transport, and oxygen sensing (3, 4). Iron is also
critical for the functioning of ribonucleotide reductase, an essential
enzyme that provides deoxynucleotide triphosphates for DNA
synthesis and repair (5). Neoplastic cells have a higher requirement

Topoisomerase Inhibition by Iron Chelator Dp44mT

Figure 1. The growth inhibitory effect of Dp44mT in cancer cell lines and
primary normal breast epithelial cells. A, cell proliferation was measured using
a sulforhodamine B dye–based assay. MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) and
MCF-12A (healthy mammary epithelial) cells were incubated with increasing
concentrations of Dp44mT, desferrioxamine (DFO), or ICRF-187 for 72 h.
Results are expressed relative to control. Inset, chemical structure of Dp44mT.
B, exponentially growing MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated for 48 or 72 h with
0.1 Amol/L doxorubicin (horizontally striped columns ), 10 nmol/L Dp44mT,
15 Amol/L desferrioxamine, or 0.5 Amol/L ICRF-187 (vertically striped
columns). When tested in combination with doxorubicin, cells were incubated
with each iron chelator for 1 h before adding doxorubicin (crossed columns ).
Results are expressed relative to control cells (gray solid columns ). C, colony
formation assay was done on MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with Dp44mT
(1 nmol/L–10 Amol/L), doxorubicin (10 nmol/L and 100 nmol/L), or the
combination (10 nmol/L Dp44mT and 10 or 100 nmol/L doxorubicin). Cells
were preincubated with Dp44mT for 1 h, exposed to doxorubicin for 24 h,
washed, and then incubated for a period of 7 d. Representative of at least three
independent experiments. Bars, SD. * P < 0.05, between treatment with
combination and treatment with doxorubicin alone.

Members of the DNA damage response pathway are among the
first responders to genomic alterations produced by DNA-targeting
agents such as VP-16, doxorubicin, and camptothecin. The ataxia
telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–related kinase family, is autophosphorylated

low doses of Dp44mT in vitro and in vivo, with and without
doxorubicin, for potential cytotoxic activity and compared it to
desferrioxamine and ICRF-187. The distinctive cytotoxic activity of
Dp44mT led us to hypothesize that it may possess DNA-damaging
activity.

on Ser1981 and acts on downstream substrates responsible for DNA
repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Histone H2AX phosphorylated on Ser139, termed g-H2AX, is one of the earliest markers of
replication-associated DNA double-strand breaks that are induced
by inhibition of DNA synthesis (22, 23). g-H2AX is proposed to
anchor broken chromosomes together and recruit DNA repair
elements, including Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1. Other substrates of ATM
are the cell cycle checkpoint–associated kinases Chk1 and Chk2
(24). The Chk2 kinase undergoes a cascade of autophosphorylation,
including on Thr68, upon DNA damage induced by blockage of DNA
replication (25).
In this report, we present results that prove a unique DNAdamaging, topoisomerase IIa (top2a)–directed mechanism of
action for Dp44mT that may be partly responsible for its antitumor
activity.

previously (26). HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, cells were collected by trypsinization and cultured
in 96-well plates for 72 h, followed by a sulforhodamine B–based growth
inhibition assay.
Western blot analysis and antibodies. Whole cell protein lysates were
extracted and used for Western blot analysis as previously described (22).
Antibodies for pChk1-S345, pChk2-T68, a-tubulin, and pATM-S1981 were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies.
Top1- and top2-induced DNA cleavage assays. Topoisomerasemediated reactions have been described previously (27). The 161-bp
fragment from pBluescript SK( ) phagemid DNA (Stratagene) was 3¶-end
labeled with [a-32P]dGTP. For topoisomerase I (top1) cleavage assays,
labeled DNA (50 fmol/reaction) was incubated with 5 ng of recombinant
top1 with or without drug at 25jC in 10 AL of reaction buffer. MaxamGilbert loading buffer was then added to the reaction mixtures. Aliquots
were separated in 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 mol/L urea) in
1 Tris-borate EDTA for 2 h at 40 V/cm at 50jC.
For top2 assays, the same pSK fragments used for top1 assays or singlestranded oligonucleotides were 5¶-end labeled with [32P]ATP and T4
polynucleotide kinase. Labeling mixtures were subsequently centrifuged
through Mini Quick Spin DNA columns ( for pSK fragments) or Oligo
columns ( for oligonucleotides; Roche Diagnostics) to remove the unincorporated label. Annealing to the complementary strand of the oligonucleotides was done by heating the reaction mixture to 95jC and overnight
cooling to room temperature in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mmol/L
NaCl, and 1 mmol/L EDTA. DNA substrates (10 pmol/reaction) were
incubated with 500 ng of top2a or top2h in the presence or absence of
drugs for the indicated times at 25jC in 10 AL of reaction buffer. Reactions
were stopped by adding SDS ( final concentration 0.5%). Samples were
separated on 16% ( for pSK DNA) or 20% ( for the oligonucleotides)
denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 mol/L urea). Imaging and quantitation
were done using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).
Immunocomplex of enzyme assay. Topoisomerase-DNA adducts were
detected as described previously (27). Top1-DNA complexes were detected
using the C21 top1 monoclonal antibody (gift from Yung-Chi Cheng, Yale
University, New Haven, CT) following standard Western blotting procedures.
Top2a and top2h antibodies were obtained from Abcam. The pan-caspase
inhibitor z-VAD-fmk was obtained from Bachem.
Antibodies used for confocal microscopy of nuclear protein
localization. Cells grown in Nunc chamber slides (Nalgene) using 0.5 mL
of tissue culture medium were fixed and permeabilized as described
previously using 4% paraformaldehyde and ice-cold 70% ethanol (22, 28).
The rabbit anti–g-H2AX antibody was obtained from Dr. William Bonner
(National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). The phosphorylated S1981-ATM
was purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Line scans were done to
graphically represent the extent of colocalization using Image J software
(NIH).
Alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay for evaluation
of DNA damage. DNA damage was measured using the alkaline Comet
assay based on the modification described by Singh and colleagues (29). For
this assay, 5,000 MDA-MB-231 cells before and after the treatment were
mixed with 40 AL of 0.5% low melting point agarose in PBS at 37jC. The
mixture was layered onto a fully frosted microscope slide (Fisher Scientific)
coated previously with 100 AL of 0.65% normal agarose in PBS, followed by a
top layer of 80 AL of low melting point agarose. After solidification, the
slides were left in a lysis solution (2.5 mol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris,
100 mmol/L EDTA, 10% DMSO, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 10) at 4jC for 1 h.
The slides were then placed in electrophoretic buffer (1 mmol/L EDTA,
300 mmol/L NaOH, pH 13) for 20 min at 4jC to allow unwinding of DNA.
Electrophoresis was conducted for the next 20 min at 35 V (0.7 V/cm) and
300 mA. After the electrophoresis, the slides were washed with
neutralization buffer (0.4 mol/L Tris, pH 7.5) and stained with 25 AL of
20 Ag/mL ethidium bromide. Cells, 100 per treatment condition, were
analyzed under an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon). The raw images
captured were quantitated using CometScore software by Tritek Corp.
Cellular responses to DNA damage were expressed as the ‘‘tail moment,’’

Cell culture. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM:F12 (1:1)
containing 5% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mmol/L L-glycine, 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate, and 50 Amol/L h-mercaptoethanol at 37jC in 5% CO2 in air. MCF12A primary healthy epithelial cells were obtained from Biowhittaker

Colonies were counted manually. Counts were obtained from at least three
independent experiments. The number of colonies obtained from each
experiment was normalized to the untreated sample (n = 100). For
statistical analyses, the combination drug-treated values was compared
with each single agent alone. Asterisks are used to denote statistically
significant differences (P < 0.05) following an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s
t test.
Assessment of antiproliferative activity. Growth inhibition was
assessed by the sulforhodamine B (Sigma-Aldrich) assay as described
previously (27). IC50 was calculated using the software Prism 5 (GraphPad
Software, Inc.). Data were obtained from at least three independent
experiments. The absorbance values obtained from each experiment were
normalized to the untreated sample (n = 100). For statistical analyses, the
combination drug-treated values were compared with each single agent
alone. Asterisks are used to denote statistically significant differences
(P < 0.05) following an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test.
Flow cytometric analysis. For cell cycle analyses, cells were harvested
and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol for 30 min at 4jC (14). Cells were analyzed

relative DNA content therein (30). Ionizing radiation (1 Gy) was used as a
positive control.

population of cells with sub-G1 (apoptotic) DNA content. Dp44mT
alone caused a dose-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-231
cells and a 2% to 4% increase in cytoxicity (sub-G1 DNA) when
tested at 20 to 100 nmol/L. The percentage of G1 cells increased
from f47% to 78% with 100 nmol/L Dp44mT after 48 hours. The
ability of Dp44mT to induce G1-S cell cycle arrest in p53-mutantcontaining MDA-MB-231 cells is also indicative of its p53independent mechanism of action (31). The cell cycle modulating
activity of Dp44mT was distinct from that of the iron chelator
desferrioxamine (15 Amol/L; Fig. 2C), which, as shown previously,
had minimal effect on the cell cycle profile of MDA-MB-231 cells. In
addition, desferrioxamine did not inhibit the G2-M arrest induced
by doxorubicin but slightly increased the percentage of cells with
sub-G1 DNA content in the presence of doxorubicin. Overall, the
cell cycle studies with Dp44mT are in agreement with the
sulforhodamine B assay results and show that low concentrations
of the iron chelator Dp44mT enhance the breast cancer cell killing
activity of doxorubicin.
DNA damage and checkpoint activation induced by
Dp44mT. We tested the hypothesis that Dp44mT might be inducing
its cell cycle and growth inhibitory activity by causing DNA damage.
First, DNA damage was measured by confocal microscopy. The
phosphorylation of Ser139 (S139) in histone H2AX and the resultant
formation of nuclear foci of phospho-histone g-H2AX were used as a
measure of DNA double strand breaks, as previously described (23).
The autophosphorylation of the upstream kinase ATM at Ser1981
(S1981) was used to ascertain if the ATM kinase was colocalized
with g-H2AX. Such colocalization would confirm the activation of a
DNA damage checkpoint at the site of damage (25). As expected,
doxorubicin treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a
significant increase in nuclear foci for both g-H2AX and pS1981ATM (Fig. 3A). For g-H2AX, doxorubicin produced on average of
9.2 foci per nucleus with 46% of cells having at least one focus.
Interestingly, 20 nmol/L Dp44mT as a single agent caused a
significant increase in both the number of foci per nucleus and the
percentage of MDA-MB-231 cells with detectable foci after exposure
for 6 hours (quantitation, Fig. 3B), with an average of 4.6 foci per
nucleus (compared with 0.5 focus per nucleus in control cells) and
with 28% of the nuclei with at least 1 focus (compared with <7% in
control cells). The combination of Dp44mT and doxorubicin
resulted in an increased percentage of cells (68%) with DNA
damage. The number of foci per nucleus also increased to 19.1.
Desferrioxamine alone at 15 Amol/L did not cause any appreciable
foci formation, but it, too, modestly enhanced the level of DNA
damage caused by doxorubicin. The signal for g-H2AX and pS1981ATM was found to be colocalized, as confirmed by line scan analysis
(Fig. 3A, bottom). The induction of DNA strand breaks by Dp44mT
alone in MDA-MB-231 cells was confirmed by an alkaline Comet
assay (Fig. 3C). Appreciable DNA damage was measured with 100
nmol/L Dp44mT after a 24-hour exposure.
We further investigated the molecular events associated
with Dp44mT-induced cell cycle arrest by measuring the
phosphorylation/activation of Chk1 and Chk2, which are known
regulators of cell cycle checkpoints. The phosphorylation of Chk1
at Ser345 and Chk2 at Thr68 in MDA-MB-231 cells was measured by
Western blot immunoassay. A rapid activation of Chk1 and a
delayed, temporal activation of Chk2 were observed with
increasing incubation times following addition of 20 nmol/L
Dp44mT to the cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, Dp44mT activated a DNA
damage and cell cycle checkpoint marked by phosphorylation of
H2AX, ATM, and Chk1.

Results
Inhibition of tumor cell growth by Dp44mT. The antiproliferative activity of Dp44mT was first tested in various tumor
cell lines compared with healthy cells using the sulforhodamine
B dye–based assay and different concentrations of Dp44mT. The
growth inhibition in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 was compared with the effect on healthy human mammary
epithelial MCF-12A cells. The biological activity of Dp44mT was
compared with two other well-studied iron chelators, desferrioxamine and dexrazoxane (ICRF-187). As shown in Fig. 1, Dp44mT
was highly toxic to MDA-MB-231, showing 50% growth
inhibition (GI50 values) at f100 nmol/L Dp44mT. Much greater
concentrations of Dp44mT were required to inhibit the growth
of MCF-12A, with GI50 values >10 Amol/L. Desferrioxamine and
ICRF-187 had much less growth inhibitory activity on the
aggressive tumor cells and were relatively nontoxic to the
normal cells (Fig. 1A, middle and right), in agreement with our
previous report (14).
The goal of adjuvant chemotherapy protocols is to maximize
tumor cell killing while sparing healthy tissues from the toxic side
effects. Iron chelators have been tested for their chemotherapeutic
and cardioprotective potentials primarily in combination with
anthracycline drugs such as doxorubicin. For this study, we tested
the growth inhibitory activity of Dp44mT in combination with
doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Pretreatment of
MDA-MB-231 tumor cells with 10 nmol/L Dp44mT for 1 hour
significantly enhanced the growth inhibition caused by doxorubicin
(measured at 72 hours; Fig. 1B). In contrast, desferrioxamine did
not significantly enhance the antitumor activity of doxorubicin
at either 48 or 72 hours. Using ICRF-187 seemed to reduce
doxorubicin-induced growth inhibition at 72 hours, although this
effect was not statistically significant (P = 0.076). Overall, Dp44mT
seemed to have the greatest effect on enhancing doxorubicininduced growth inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells.
One of the hallmark traits of cancer cells is their ability to
undergo isolated clonal growth. The anticancer activity of Dp44mT
was further shown using a colony formation assay with MDA-MB231 cells. Dp44mT caused significant, dose-dependent inhibition
of colony formation at concentrations of z10 nmol/L (Fig. 1C).
Furthermore, the combination of 10 nmol/L Dp44mT with
doxorubicin resulted in significantly fewer colonies than seen with
either agent alone. Thus, Dp44mT has distinct anticancer cell
killing activity in breast cancer cells and is only toxic to healthy
mammary epithelial cells at higher concentrations.
Cell cycle arrest by Dp44mT as a mechanism leading to
growth arrest. The effects of Dp44mT on cell cycle progression
and cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells were analyzed by flow
cytometric analysis of DNA content using fixed, propidium iodide–
stained cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to doxorubicin alone
(0.1 Amol/L, 48 hours), Dp44mT alone (20–100 nmol/L, 48 hours),
or a combination of the two drugs at 48 hours (Fig. 2A and B). The
iron chelator desferrioxamine was tested for comparison. Doxorubicin (0.1 Amol/L) induced a G2-M arrest in MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells (Fig. 2A), as shown in previous studies (14). The
addition of Dp44mT (20 nmol/L) seemed to abrogate the G2-M
arrest caused by doxorubicin and significantly increased the

completion of their catalytic activity is inhibited. Whereas top1
induces single-stranded nicks, top2 is associated with doublestrand breaks. Topoisomerases are targeted by several established
clinical anticancer agents such as VP-16 and camptothecins. To
determine whether the mechanism of induction of DNA strand
breaks by Dp44mT involves the targeting of nuclear DNA

Top2A as a target for Dp44mT. Topoisomerase targeting is
one of the mechanisms by which DNA-damaging agents manifest
their cytotoxicity (32). DNA supercoiling during replication and
repair is relaxed by the topoisomerase enzymes (33), which can
then form interfacial covalent inhibitory complexes with the DNA
and topoisomerase inhibitors and cause DNA strand breaks when

Topoisomerase Inhibition by Iron Chelator Dp44mT

Because top2a is an essential gene (34), these top2a+/ isogenic
cells provided a useful model for testing the role of top2a in
cytotoxic signaling. In control experiments, the top2a+/ cells were
found to express f57% as much top2a enzyme levels as the wildtype counterpart cells (see ref. 26 for extensive characterization
data). The cytotoxicity of Dp44mT (at 100 nmol/L) was compared
in the three cell lines by flow cytometric analysis of propidium
iodide staining for sub-G1 DNA–containing cells (Fig. 4B). The
results shows that the top2a+/ cells are partially resistant to the
cytotoxic effects of Dp44mT compared with the wild-type (top2a+/+)
or top2h / cells (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S1A). After exposure
to Dp44mT (100 nmol/L), the top2a+/+ and top2h / cells showed
31.7% and 38.2% sub-G1 containing cells, respectively. In contrast,
the top2a+/ cells only had 9.4%. VP-16 (10 Amol/L) was used as a

topoisomerases, we first performed an in vitro DNA cleavage
assay. Radiolabeled DNA substrates were incubated with top1,
top2a, or top2h in the presence or absence of drug. Dp44mT at
concentrations of z100 nmol/L specifically targeted top2a
(Fig. 4A). The DNA cleavage pattern of Dp44mT was distinct
from that of VP-16, which was used as a positive control.
Dp44mT had no appreciable effect on 2h activity. Dp44mT also
did not show any top1-directed activity (Fig. 4A), for which
camptothecin (1 Amol/L) and MJ-III-65 (1 Amol/L) were used as
positive controls (32).
To determine whether top2a is associated with the cytotoxic
activity of Dp44mT, we used a set of isogenic Nalm-6 leukemic cell
lines heterozygous for top2a (denoted top2a+/+ or top2a+/ ) or
with a homozygous deletion of top2h (denoted top2h / ; ref. 26).

Topoisomerase Inhibition by Iron Chelator Dp44mT

may be able to serve as an anticancer agent by virtue of its ability
to inhibit cancer cell metabolism through iron chelation and its
novel ability to cause cytotoxic chromatin damage.
Inhibition of top2A activity by Dp44mT. In this report, we
show that Dp44mT causes DNA damage and inhibition of top2a
activity. Top2 alters DNA topology by catalyzing the passage of the
intact DNA double helix through a transient double-stranded break
made on another DNA double helix. This step is critical for
relieving torsional stress that occurs during DNA replication,
repair, and transcription (33). When top2 is prevented from
completing its catalytic cycle, DNA strand breaks ensue. Dp44mT
induces top2a-mediated DNA cleavage in vitro and has no
apparent effect on top2h or top1 (Fig. 4). The top2a-mediated
activity of Dp44mT was shown using Nalm-6 leukemia cells that
were heterozygous deficient for top2a, in which Dp44mT had only
half of the cytotoxic activity compared with wild-type cells. This
association was confirmed using a siRNA knockdown approach in
HeLa cells, in which top2a siRNA cells, but not top2h or control
siRNA cells, were partially resistant to Dp44mT. In addition,
Dp44mT is able to induce the formation of stable cellular top2aDNA complexes, indicative of top2a poisoning in cancer cells. To
our knowledge, this is the first report of a specific top2a-directed
activity for an iron chelator. In early studies, ICRF-187 (dexrazoxane) was shown to have the ability to inhibit topoisomerases, but
not top2a specifically and not at such low concentrations (16).
Dp44mT inhibits top2a activity at concentrations (100 nmol/L)
that are 10- to 100-fold lower than those used to show top2
inhibition by ICRF-187 (39). ICRF-187 is a prodrug that is
hydrolyzed or converted to an EDTA-like compound. Further
studies will be needed to ascertain the conversion of Dp44mT
in vivo and the activity of the metabolites for better comparison
with bisdioxopiperazines (ICRF-187/ICRF-193) activity (40, 41).
Other iron chelating analogues of di-2-pyridylketone isonicotinoyl
hydrazone have been tested for DNA cleavage activity and do not
inhibit top1 (42). No reports have provided data on top2 activity for
these analogues.
The top2a directed activity by Dp44mT is novel and may be
clinically advantageous for several reasons. First, proliferating cells
such as cancer cells express highly elevated levels of top2a
compared with healthy cells, making this isozyme a suitable target
for anticancer therapy (43). Second, the targeting of top2h for
cancer chemotherapy has been implicated in development of
secondary malignancies (44), thereby diminishing the utility of
top2h inhibition in the treatment of some cancers. Finally, one key
goal of iron chelation therapy is to use it in conjunction with other
chemotherapy drugs to limit the toxic side effects of drugs that
induce reactive oxygen species, as occurs in heart tissue exposed to
anthracycline drugs such as doxorubicin (45). ICRF-187 does not
itself inhibit the growth of tumors in animal models and thus is
viewed as a cardioprotective drug to be used combination with
doxorubicin (17, 39). Because cardiac cells do not express top2a
(46), Dp44mT may be able to serve as a cardioprotective agent
while also enhancing cancer cell cytotoxicity when administered in
combination with doxorubicin.
DNA-damaging activity of Dp44mT. To our knowledge, this is
also the first report of a DNA-damaging activity for Dp44mT.
Dp44mT caused a clear increase in number of g-H2AX foci along
with an increased colocalized signal for phosphorylated ATM when
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with nanomolar chelator concentrations. Induction of DNA breaks by Dp44mT was confirmed in
breast cancer cells by measuring Comet tails under alkaline

positive control. The reduced cytotoxicity of Dp44mT selectively
in top2a/ Nalm-6 cells was also confirmed using a direct
morphologic assessment following Hoescht-33342/propidium
iodide staining (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We then performed an
in vivo assay to measure cellular complex formation between top1,
top2a, or top2h and DNA following Dp44mT treatment of the
top2a/h wild-type Nalm-6 cells. The immunocomplex of enzyme
formation assay was done 6 and 24 hours after treatment with 0.1
and 1 Amol/L of Dp44mT. As shown in Fig. 4C, Dp44mT caused
covalent complex formation between top2a and the DNA. VP-16
(at 100 Amol/L) was used as a positive control. No complex
formation was observed when probed for top1 or top2h. To confirm
that the top2a-DNA complexes formed were not secondary to
apoptosis (35), we preincubated Nalm-6 cells with the pan-caspase
inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (100 Amol/L for 30 minutes) and tested for
top2a complex formation after 24 hours (Fig. 4D). Pretreatment
with caspase inhibitor failed to rescue the top2a complex
formation, confirming top2a targeting by Dp44mT. An orthogonal
approach was then taken to establish the association between
top2a and Dp44mT-mediated cytotoxicity. Transient siRNAmediated knockdown of top2a and top2h was carried out in HeLa
cells (26). A protein level reduction of f78% and 85% was observed
for top2a and top2h, respectively (Fig. 4E). Using the sulforhodamine B–based growth inhibition assay, top2a siRNA cells showed a
partial resistance to Dp44mT (0.1 and 0.3 Amol/L) when compared
with the top2h siRNA– or control siRNA–treated cells at 72 hours.
Taken together, these results show that top2a mediates, at least in
part, the in vivo biological activity of Dp44mT.

Discussion
Use of iron chelators for cancer therapy. Iron chelators are
being explored as anticancer agents largely because cancer cells
have an increased requirement for iron due to their increased levels
of metabolism as compared with normal cells. However, iron
chelators themselves have not met with clear success in the clinic,
although they have shown promise in some nonclinical models
(16). For example, the short half-life, low membrane permeability,
and lack of activity following oral administration of desferrioxamine have limited its antitumor activity in clinical settings (18).
Recently, triapine, a tridentate iron chelator, produced doselimiting toxicities in phase II trials in patients with non–small-cell
lung and prostrate cancer without clear therapeutic benefit
(36, 37). The hexadentate iron chelator tachypyridine, by arresting
cancer cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, showed antitumor and
radiation-sensitizing activity that remains to be extended to the
clinic (11). ICRF-187 has no appreciable antitumor activity in
animals (38) or in vitro unless it is used at very high concentrations
that are not pharmacologically achievable (e.g., see Fig. 1). The
reduction in cytotoxicity we observed with ICRF-187 in combination with doxorubicin is probably due to the intact bisdioxopiperazine acting as a catalytic inhibitor of top2 (both isozymes) and
likely preventing doxorubicin-induced poisoning of top2 (both
isozymes) as previously shown (39). Dp44mT is a newer, more
potent iron chelator that has been shown to have antitumor
activity in mice xenografted with a range of human tumors,
including tumors resistant to VP-16 (12). Here we show that low
concentrations of Dp44mT are selectively toxic to breast cancer
cells compared with normal breast epithelial cells. Whereas
Dp44mT is highly lipophilic and antiproliferative, its exact
mechanism of action has been unclear. We show that Dp44mT

conditions. The concentrations that caused g-H2AX formation are
within the same range as those that showed antiproliferative
activity by Dp44mT. In contrast, ICRF-187 has been shown to
enhance the formation of g-H2AX by VP-16 or ionizing radiation,
and there is no clear evidence that it can itself induce g-H2AX
formation (38).
Effects of Dp44mT on the cell cycle. The cytotoxic activity of
Dp44mT was associated with an ability to induce growth inhibition
and G1-S cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cell lines. The G1-S phase
arrest by an iron chelator is expected based on previous findings
with other agents that interfere with iron metabolism (6, 47). The
G1-S cell cycle arrest by Dp44mT may also indicate that the iron
chelating activity of Dp44mT is, in fact, its primary mechanism of
cancer cell growth inhibition because classic top2 inhibitors such
as doxorubicin and VP-16 induce a G2-M arrest in cancer cells (43).
Although we cannot rule out that Dp44mT can extend part of its
effect by interfering with DNA condensation during mitosis
(as with ICRF-187), this is unlikely because we observe a G1-S
arrest and no polyploidization by Dp44mT (41). We also found that
Dp44mT activates a cell cycle checkpoint via phosphorylation of
ATM and Chk1/Chk2. Following its autophosphorylation, ATM acts
as the upstream kinase for sensing and transducing the damage
signal to a range of substrates including Chk1 and Chk2. The
appearance of phosphorylated forms of both Chk1 and Chk2 is
possibly indicative of their redundant effect for downstream
inhibitory kinase activity on the Cdc25A phosphatase, which
normally allows cellular progression through the G1-S phase (48).
The early appearance of Chk1 and late temporal appearance of
Chk2 may indicate that Chk1 is the primary kinase responsible for
cell cycle arrest induced by Dp44mT. Recent work suggesting that
iron chelation can induce proteasome-mediated degradation of
cell cycle proteins underlines the more complicated nature of
downstream signaling following cell cycle arrest by an iron chelator
(7). Ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1
and p21waf1 has been described in response to iron chelation by
desferrioxamine and 311 (49, 50). The G1-S cell cycle arrest by
Dp44mT (and likely the escape from a G2-M arrest) could possibly
be explained by iron-mediated proteolysis of these and other
unknown cell cycle checkpoint proteins. Further investigations will
be needed to characterize the degradation of proteins that could
signal for a G1-S cell cycle arrest by Dp44mT, despite targeting
top2a.

Combination of Dp44mT and doxorubicin. The combined
treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with both Dp44mT
and doxorubicin enhanced all of the cytotoxic effects induced by
doxorubicin alone. This included growth inhibition and induction
of sub-G1 DNA–containing cells. Importantly for cancer treatment,
the combination of doxorubicin with Dp44mT completely inhibited
the clonogenic growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. In the presence of
Dp44mT, doxorubicin was also unable to induce a G2-M cell cycle
arrest. The abrogation of a G2-M checkpoint is likely the
mechanism by which Dp44mT exacerbates the cytotoxicity of
doxorubicin because checkpoint activity is required for the DNA
repair steps that permit cells to survive otherwise toxic DNA
damage. The DNA-damaging activity of doxorubicin was also
enhanced in the presence of Dp44mT as measured by induction of
S139 phosphorylated histone g-H2AX. The presence of g-H2AX
nuclear foci is currently being developed as a clinical biomarker by
the National Cancer Institute and might be of clinical utility for
evaluating Dp44mT (27). The increased g-H2AX–associated DNA
double-strand breaks induced by the drug combination may derive
from the combined inhibition of top2a by Dp44mT and of top2h by
doxorubicin (39).
In summary, the novel and multifaceted modes of action for
Dp44mT present a mechanistically advantageous agent for cancer
therapy, especially for cancers resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Further preclinical studies on Dp44mT are therefore
warranted to evaluate its clinical potential.
