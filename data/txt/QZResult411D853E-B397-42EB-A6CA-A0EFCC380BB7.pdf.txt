Abstract
Mounting evidence suggests that bone marrow–derived cells (BMDC) contribute to tumor growth,
angiogenesis, and metastasis. In acute reactions to cancer therapy, several types of BMDCs are rapidly
mobilized to home tumors. Although this host reaction to therapy can promote tumor regrowth, its
contribution to metastasis has not been explored. To focus only on the effects of chemotherapy on the
host, we studied non–tumor-bearing mice. Plasma from animals treated with the chemotherapy paclitaxel
induced angiogenesis, migration, and invasion of tumor cells along with host cell colonization. Lesser effects
were seen with the chemotherapy gemcitabine. Conditioned medium from BMDCs and plasma from
chemotherapy-treated mice each promoted metastatic properties in tumor cells by inducing matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In mice in which Lewis lung
carcinoma cells were injected intravenously, treatment with paclitaxel, but not gemcitabine or vehicle,
accelerated metastases in a manner that could be blocked by an MMP9 inhibitor. Moreover, chimeric mice
reconstituted with BMDC where MMP9 activity was attenuated did not support accelerated metastasis by
carcinoma cells that were pretreated with chemotherapy before their introduction to host animals. Taken
together, our ﬁndings illustrate how some chemotherapies can exert prometastatic effects that may confound
treatment outcomes. Cancer Res; 71(22); 6986–96. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
For the last several years, antiangiogenic therapy has
emerged as an additional treatment modality in clinical oncology for a number of malignancies that include colorectal (1),
non–small cell lung (2), hepatocellular (3), and renal cell (4)
cancers. However, the approval of antiangiogenic drugs by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been limited
because such drugs sometimes resulted in increased progression-free, but not overall, survival of patients with certain
tumors, for example, advanced metastatic breast cancer (5).
Therefore, doubts have been raised with respect to the overall
efﬁcacy of antiangiogenic therapy.

In addition to the local sprouting of tumor microvessels
from nearby vessels, endothelial precursor cells (EPC) were
also found to contribute to tumor angiogenesis, by incorporating to the luminal side of the blood vessel wall (6). Although
controversies arose with respect to the functional role of EPCs
in tumor angiogenesis (7), other types of bone marrow–derived
cells (BMDC; ref. 8), for example, hemangiocytes (9, 10), Tie-2–
expressing monocytes (11), and myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSC; ref. 12), were found to contribute to tumor
angiogenesis, by possible paracrine mechanisms.
We recently reported that acute and substantial EPC mobilization occurs in mice that were treated with either vascular
disrupting agents (VDA) or chemotherapy drugs, for example,
paclitaxel (13, 14). These treatments resulted in homing of
EPCs to the treated tumors, where they promoted angiogenesis
that was accompanied by rapid tumor cell repopulation and
subsequent tumor regrowth (13, 14). We also showed that the
treatment outcome was improved when the mice were treated
with an antiangiogenic drug that inhibits EPC mobilization (13,
14). However, an improved outcome was not observed when
the antiangiogenic drug was administered prior to chemotherapy such as gemcitabine, which does not affect mobilization
of EPCs (13). The robust recruitment of EPCs to tumors
induced by drugs, such as VDAs or paclitaxel, may be a
consequence, at least in part, of an attempt to repair damage
in the tumor vasculature caused by such drugs (15). These
results further suggested that antiangiogenic drugs may act as

Host Response to Chemotherapy Accelerates Metastases

chemosensitizing agents by inhibiting host systemic rebound
angiogenesis mediated by bone marrow–derived EPCs, in
response to cytotoxic drug treatment (13).
The role of BMDCs in tumors is not only limited to the
induction in angiogenesis but also to metastasis. The metastatic process depends on the interaction between disseminated tumor cells (termed "seeds") and their speciﬁc metastatic microenvironment (termed "soil"; ref. 16). Recent
evidence suggests that hematopoietic progenitor cells that
express the VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR1) are crucial for creating
the initial microenvironment for metastatic growth in the soil
of secondary sites (17). These cells are home to distant tumorspeciﬁc premetastatic sites, where they cluster to create "premetastatic niches" for tumor cell seeding (17). EPCs have also
been reported as being inﬂuential for promoting the growth of
tumor metastases. Speciﬁcally, Gao and colleagues showed
that EPCs are crucial regulators of the "angiogenic switch,"
which mediates the shift of micrometastases to lethal macrometastases (18). Thus, the formation of metastasis-permissive
niches for tumor cell seeding and their growth in other organs
depends, at least in part, on several types of BMDCs, and
therefore blocking their activity and/or mobilization by targeted drugs may improve treatment outcome.
Numerous molecular factors are also associated with metastasis spread. The initiation of metastases involves the invasion
of tumor cells into peripheral tissue, a process which requires
the crossing of several physical barriers, such as the endothelial
basement membrane. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have
been shown to promote metastases in a growing tumor by the
proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, as well as by activating
signaling pathways that are important for tumor cell migration
(19). MMP9, like other MMPs, belongs to a superfamily of zinc
containing proteases and has been shown to associate with
tumorigenesis (19). There is increasing evidence showing that
tumor-associated macrophages, following their invasion into
the primary tumor sites, support the motility of metastatic
cancer cell extravasation (20). However, the role of MMP9
expressed by BMDCs in mice treated with chemotherapy has
not been investigated.
In the current study, we hypothesized that chemotherapy
may not only increase angiogenesis but also accelerate the
metastatic process, the latter of which can be modulated by
BMDCs, which are acutely mobilized in response to therapy. To
test this hypothesis, we used non–tumor-bearing mice that
were treated with maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of either
paclitaxel or gemcitabine chemotherapy, to assess the effect of
the chemotherapy on the host, and the contribution of the
response of host on tumor and endothelial cell activity. The
results of our study reveal possible new pathways by which
acute reaction of the host to some cytotoxic drugs can induce
metastasis in mice.

nodeﬁcient (SCID) female mice (Harlan), 8 to 10 weeks of age,
were implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and LM2-4
breast carcinoma cells, respectively. The mice were treated
with the following drugs: 50 mg/kg paclitaxel, 500 mg/kg
gemcitabine, or 4 mg/kg MMP2–MMP9 inhibitor III. Detailed
protocols are available in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Cells and cell culture
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were
kindly provided by Dr. Neta Ilan (Faculty of Medicine,
Technion) and were cultured in gelatin-coated dishes, using
a previously described protocol (21). Cells were identiﬁed as
endothelial cells by the CD31 surface marker. MDA-MB-231,
LLC, HT1080, MCF-7, and HEK293-T cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and were
used within 6 months of resuscitation. LM2-4 tumor cells,
which were previously established from the MDA-MB-231
cell line, were kindly provided by Prof. Robert Kerbel (Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada),
and were used as previously described (22). All cells were
cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The SCp2 murine epithelial
cells were kindly provided by Prof. Israel Vlodavsky, Technion, and were cultured according to the work described
by Desprez and colleagues (23). All cells were passed in
culture for no more than 6 months after being thawed from
authentic stocks.

Single-cell suspension
Preparation of a single-cell suspension from the Matrigel
plugs was carried out using a previously described protocol
(27).
Flow cytometry
To identify the BMDC types that colonized the Matrigel
plugs, single-cell suspensions of the cells from the plugs were
ﬁrst prepared and were then immunostained for ﬂow cytometric analysis as described in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Immunostaining
The cell types in the Matrigel plugs, the tumor tissues, and
the cells from various cultures were identiﬁed by immunoﬂuorescence staining as previously described (14, 28). Detailed
protocols are available in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
A chimeric mouse model with inhibited MMP9
expression in their BMDCs
Transfection of MMP9 into BMDCs was carried out as
previously described for Id-1 (18). Detailed protocols are
available in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance of
differences was assessed by one-way ANOVA, followed by
Newman–Keuls ad hoc statistical test using GraphPad Prism
4 software (GraphPad). Differences between all groups were
compared with each other and were considered signiﬁcant at
values of P < 0.05.

Results
The plasma from chemotherapy-treated mice induces
endothelial cell invasion, migration, and vessel
sprouting
Our previous studies showed that certain types of chemotherapy drugs administered to non–tumor-bearing mice can
rapidly induce EPC mobilization, in part, by the overexpression
of numerous factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF) and stromal cell–derived factor 1-a (SDF-1a;
refs. 13, 29). We showed that these effects stimulated angiogenesis in treated tumors and contributed to tumor regrowth.
Thus, the host-derived response to chemotherapy may contribute to tumor angiogenesis and subsequent tumor regrowth
(13). Therefore, we further examined the effects of paclitaxel or
gemcitabine chemotherapy on the host and the effect of its
response on endothelial cell behavior. To this end, we ﬁrst
treated non–tumor-bearing mice with MTDs of either paclitaxel or gemcitabine. After 24 hours, their plasma was collected
and then used for assessing endothelial cell migration, invasion, and microvessel sprouting. Plasma from the paclitaxeltreated mice induced a signiﬁcant increase in migration and
invasion of endothelial cells, when compared with that caused
by plasma from the vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, plasma
from the gemcitabine-treated mice caused a signiﬁcant

6988

Cancer Res; 71(22) November 15, 2011

increase in endothelial cell invasion but not in endothelial
cell migration when compared with plasma from the vehicletreated mice (Fig. 1A and B). Furthermore, we found that
plasma from the chemotherapy-treated mice signiﬁcantly
increased microvessel sprouting, when compared with that
caused by plasma from vehicle-treated mice as was assessed by
aortic ring assay (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1). These results
provide evidence that the plasma from paclitaxel- and gemcitabine-treated mice can induce a spectrum of endothelial cell
activity following chemotherapy.
The plasma of chemotherapy-treated mice promotes
colonization of host cells in Matrigel plugs
To further elucidate the effect of chemotherapy on host
cells, we implanted Matrigel that contained 10% plasma,
which has been obtained from chemotherapy-treated mice
into the ﬂanks of C57BL/6 mice. The plugs were then
assessed for the number of host cells that colonized the
plugs. The number of host cells, such as the endothelial cells,
in the Matrigel plugs that contained plasma from the
chemotherapy-treated mice was higher than that found in
Matrigel plugs that contained plasma from the vehicletreated mice (Fig. 2A and B). We then prepared single-cell
suspensions from the digested plugs to determine the numbers of both hemangiocytes and MDSCs in the implanted
plugs because both are known to contribute to angiogenesis
(30, 31). We found that the numbers of both hemangiocytes
and MDSCs as well as CD45þ BMDCs colonizing the plugs
that contained plasma from the chemotherapy-treated mice
were signiﬁcantly greater than those in the plugs that
contained plasma of the vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2B).
These results indicate that the host reaction to chemotherapy may modulate the tumor microenvironment by recruiting host cells, some of which are hematopoietic cells known
to contribute to tumor growth and angiogenesis.
BMDCs that colonized in chemotherapy-treated tumors
express MMP9
We next asked whether chemotherapy promotes the migration and invasion of BMDCs into tumors. We therefore
assessed the migratory properties of BMDCs from chemotherapy-treated mice using the modiﬁed Boyden chamber assay.
Our results show that the extent of migration of BMDCs from
the chemotherapy-treated mice was greater than that of the
vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3A).
MMPs have been reported to be important regulators of
tumor cell dissemination (19), and promote the invasion of
BMDCs into tumors (20, 32). Therefore, we asked whether
the host response to chemotherapy may increase secretion
and activation of MMPs in BMDCs and/or tumor cells, hence
contributing to metastasis. To this end, we determined the
levels of MMP9 in conditioned medium of BMDCs from
chemotherapy-treated mice and in conditioned medium of
MDA-MB-231 cells preexposed to plasma from the chemotherapy-treated mice. The levels of active MMP9 in these 2
conditioned media were at least twice as high as those in the
medium in which BMDCs from the vehicle-treated mice or
the MDA-MB-231 cells preexposed to plasma from the

vehicle-treated mice. The levels of the proenzymatic form of
MMP9 in conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231 cells preexposed to plasma from chemotherapy-treated mice was
more than 10-fold higher than those levels found in MDAMB-231 cells preexposed to plasma from the vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 3B and C).
This increase in MMP9 expression in both BMDCs and
tumor cells in response to chemotherapy prompted us to
investigate whether an increase in MMP9 expression also
occurs in the primary tumor and its metastases following
chemotherapy. To this end, 500 mm3 LLC tumor–bearing
mice were treated with either paclitaxel or gemcitabine.
Three days later, the mice were sacriﬁced, and tumors and
lungs were removed for determination of the expression of
MMP9 in BMDCs that colonized the primary tumor and
lungs. A substantial number of MMP9-expressing CD45þ
BMDCs in the tumor and lungs of the paclitaxel-treated
mice, but not in the tumor and lungs of gemcitabine- or
vehicle-treated mice, was observed (Fig. 3D and E; Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Notably, the number of BMDCs
that colonized the gemcitabine- or vehicle-treated tumors
was lower than the number of BMDCs in paclitaxel-treated
tumors, in agreement with our previous publication (13).
Collectively, these results suggest that the host response to
paclitaxel chemotherapy increases MMP9 secretion by the
BMDCs that colonize the primary tumor and/or its
metastases.

www.aacrjournals.org

The plasma from chemotherapy-treated mice induces
tumor cell migration and invasion
Because the plasma from chemotherapy-treated mice
induced MMP9 secretion by tumor cells, we posited that
chemotherapy can induce tumor cell migration and invasion,
and as a result can promote the formation of new metastases.
Therefore, we assessed the migratory and invasive properties
of MDA-MB-231, LM2-4, LLC, and SCp2 cell lines. Plasma from
paclitaxel-treated mice, and to a lesser extent plasma from
gemcitabine-treated mice, enhanced the migration and invasion of all tested cells, when compared with that caused by
plasma from vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4A–D). An induction in
the migration and invasion properties of MDA-MB-231 cells in
the presence of plasma obtained from mice 72 hours following
chemotherapy was also observed (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Furthermore, we found that the motility of the MDA-MB231 cells was greater when these cells were exposed to plasma
from paclitaxel-treated mice than that caused by plasma from
gemcitabine- or vehicle-treated mice in the scratch wound
assay (Fig. 4E and F). To rule out the possibility that tumorderived effects following chemotherapy can contribute to the
migration and invasion properties of tumor cells in the presence of plasma from chemotherapy-treated mice, we obtained
plasma from 500 mm3 LLC-bearing mice 24 hours following
paclitaxel or gemcitabine chemotherapy. By using the modiﬁed
Boyden chamber assay to assess migration and invasion
properties of the MDA-MB-231 cells, we found that plasma

from chemotherapy-treated LLC-bearing mice induced tumor
cell invasion and migration, similarly to plasma obtained from
non–tumor-bearing mice (Supplementary Fig. S4). Collectively, these results indicate that the host reaction to paclitaxel,
and to a lesser extent to gemcitabine, can directly promote the

actively causing MMP9 secretion.

from the paclitaxel-treated mice, but it did not occur when the
cells were exposed to conditioned media of BMDCs from the
gemcitabine- and the vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5). Collectively,
the results provide additional support for the notion that
paclitaxel can induce tumor cells to migrate, invade, and then
transiently transform into mesenchymal cells as part of the
metastatic process.

Plasma from paclitaxel-treated mice induces epithelialto-mesenchymal transition
The results of recent studies have shown that epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells is essential for
cancer metastasis (33, 34). To examine this aspect, MCF-7 cells,
frequently used for EMT studies (28), were incubated with
conditioned medium of BMDCs from chemotherapy-treated
mice. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were ﬁrst ﬁxed and then
stained for E-cadherin (an epithelial cell marker) and vimentin
(a mesenchymal cell marker) to evaluate tumor cells that
undergo EMT (28). We found that EMT occurred in MCF-7
cells that were exposed to conditioned medium of BMDCs

The effect of chemotherapy on metastases in mice
We next investigated whether chemotherapy can induce
metastasis in mice. To test this possibility, C57BL/6 mice were
treated with either paclitaxel or gemcitabine. After 24 hours,
mice were intravenously injected with GFPþ LLC cells, and 45
days later, the mice were sacriﬁced and the number of metastatic GFPþ LLC cells in the lungs was determined by ﬂow
cytometry. In a parallel experiment, the survival of mice in
treatment groups was assessed. We found that the number
of metastatic lesions and GFPþ LLC cells in the lungs of
paclitaxel-treated mice were signiﬁcantly higher than those
found in the lungs of gemcitabine- and vehicle-treated mice

Figure 3. MMP9 expression in BMDC and tumor cells following exposure to chemotherapy. A–C, BMDCs from chemotherapy-treated mice (n ¼ 5 mice per
group) were placed on a modiﬁed Boyden chamber to assess invasion (A). The expression levels of pro-MMP9 and active MMP9 were determined by
zymography using conditioned medium of either BMDCs obtained from chemotherapy-treated mice (B) or MDA-MB-231 cells preexposed to 10% plasma
from chemotherapy-treated mice (C). Zymography gels were analyzed by densitometer, and results were plotted as fold increase from the vehicle control.
Conditioned medium of HT1080 cells was used as a positive control. Zymography experiments were carried out in triplicates. D and E, the MMP9 expression

(Fig. 6A–C). In addition, the mortality rate of the paclitaxeltreated mice was higher than that of the gemcitabine- and
vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 6D). Similar results were obtained in
a repeat experiment where we tested whether the host
response to chemotherapy was the sole cause of increased
metastasis. In this experiment, GFPþ LLC cells that had been
preexposed for 24 hours to plasma from the chemotherapytreated mice were used (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, to investigate
whether chemotherapy can accelerate metastases in a more
clinically relevant spontaneous metastatic mouse model as
well, we used the LM2-4 cells as a model of spontaneous
metastases as previously shown (22). Mice bearing metastatic
lesions in the lungs were treated with paclitaxel or gemcitabine
administered every 21 days for 3 sequential cycles. The results
in Fig. 6F show that as opposed to increased mortality rate
found in mice treated with chemotherapy followed by an
intravenous injection of LLC cells, mice administered with
chemotherapy in multiple cycles in this spontaneous metas-

tasis model revealed increased survival when compared with
vehicle-treated mice. Collectively, the host response to paclitaxel, but not gemcitabine, can accelerate tumor metastasis in
short-term rapidly administered chemotherapy but failed to do
so in mice bearing spontaneous metastasis following multiple
cycles of chemotherapy.
Inhibition of MMP9 can decrease metastasis following
paclitaxel treatment
Our ﬁndings that the host response to paclitaxel can
increase MMP9 expression in tumor cells and BMDCs
prompted us to further investigate the active involvement of
MMPs in metastasis following chemotherapy. We ﬁrst determined the effect of an MMP inhibitor (MMPi) on the invasion
of tumor cells exposed to plasma from chemotherapy-treated
mice. We found that the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells
exposed to plasma from the paclitaxel-treated mice was signiﬁcantly higher than that of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to

completely abolished by a speciﬁc MMP2–MMP9 inhibitor
(Fig. 7A). We did not observe changes in the migration properties of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to plasma from the
paclitaxel- or the gemcitabine-treated mice in the presence
of the MMPi (data not shown). Next, we investigated the effect
of MMPi on metastasis in the paclitaxel-treated mice. First,
paclitaxel or vehicle was injected into the mice, and 24 hours
later, they were intravenously injected with LLC cells with or

without the MMPi. Forty-ﬁve days later, we observed that mice
from the MMPi monotherapy treatment group succumbed to
metastases; however, survival of mice treated with MMPi and
paclitaxel was remarkably extended when compared with the
mice treated with paclitaxel monotherapy. The remaining mice
were sacriﬁced, and the metastatic lesions in the lungs were
counted. The number of metastases in the lungs of the combined paclitaxel and the MMPi-treated mice was smaller than
that in lungs of the paclitaxel-treated mice (Fig. 7B).

An additional experiment to test the effect of inhibiting
MMP9 expression in BMDCs on metastasis was carried out.
MMP9 expression in BMDCs of C57BL/6 mice was inhibited by
60% by short hairpin RNA technique (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Such BMDCs were transplanted into lethally irradiated mice,
and after BMDC reconstitution, mice were injected with LLC
cells preexposed to plasma from chemotherapy-treated mice.
Mouse survival was monitored. The inhibition of MMP9 in
BMDCs in mice injected with LLC cells precultured with
plasma from paclitaxel-treated mice resulted in extended
survival when compared with their control counterparts,
which were injected with the same LLC cells (Fig. 7C). Notably,
the inhibition of MMP9 in BMDCs in mice injected with LLC
cells preexposed to plasma from vehicle-control mice
increased mouse mortality when compared with their control
counterparts (Fig. 7C). Overall, our results suggest that the
inhibition of MMP9 in paclitaxel-treated mice can suppress the
metastatic-promoting action of paclitaxel, but reversed therapeutic effects were observed in mice in which MMP9 expression was suppressed in BMDCs after they were injected with
tumor cells preexposed to plasma from vehicle-treated mice.

Discussion
Chemotherapy is one of the most common treatment
modalities for cancer, and it has been used in neoadjuvant,
adjuvant, and advanced metastatic disease. The results of this
study provide insights into the effects of chemotherapy on the
host and its reaction on tumor cells. Yamauchi and colleagues
recently showed that an intravenous injection of HT1080, a
human ﬁbrosarcoma cell line which does not usually form
metastases, can nevertheless promote them when injected into

nude mice, which were previously treated with cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (35). We have previously reported that
both VDAs and chemotherapy can induce acute mobilization
of EPCs in non–tumor-bearing mice, therefore suggesting that
anticancer drugs can cause host effects that promote angiogenesis and tumor regrowth (13, 14). In this study, we further
investigated the effect of plasma from chemotherapy-treated
mice on both host and tumor cells. We showed that plasma
from chemotherapy-treated mice can induce endothelial cell
invasion, migration, and microvessel sprouting. We found that
MMP9 is increased in tumors and in BMDCs exposed to plasma
from the chemotherapy-treated mice and showed that conditioned medium of BMDCs from paclitaxel-treated mice, but
not from gemcitabine-treated mice, induced EMT of MCF-7
cells. All of these tumorigenic effects found shortly after the
administration of chemotherapy markedly increased the mortality rate of mice intravenously injected with tumor cells;
however, when chemotherapy was administered in multiple
cycles to mice bearing spontaneous metastatic disease, a more
clinically relevant tumor model, prolonged survival was actually observed in the chemotherapy-treated groups. Thus, longterm chemotherapy may overcome the tumorigenic rapid
effects of the host in response to drug administration.
An interesting question that arose from this study deals with
the fact that MMP9 inhibition following paclitaxel chemotherapy extended the survival of mice but the same treatment
strategy in vehicle-treated mice resulted in an increased mortality rate. Hiratsuka and colleagues showed that MMP9 is
induced by VEGFR1 and is expressed in both endothelial cells
and macrophages in premetastatic lungs (36). Kaplan and
colleagues showed that blocking VEGFR1 in premetastatic
mice can inhibit metastasis growth by disrupting the

premetastatic niche (17). These studies are not in line with our
results, in part, due to the fact that our experiments were
carried out on intravenously injected tumor cells, and therefore
premetastatic niches were not formed in such mice. Nevertheless, the combination of MMPi and paclitaxel chemotherapy in mice intravenously injected with tumor cells resulted in
enhanced survival when compared with mice treated with
paclitaxel monotherapy. The results of our study provide
additional important evidence that BMDCs can contribute to
metastasis, not only in unperturbed tumors but also following
acute cytotoxic drug therapy, despite the myelosuppressive
effects commonly found following chemotherapy (37). The

6994

suppression of MMP9 expression in BMDCs, using genetic
manipulation in a chimeric mouse model, resulted in increased
survival of mice following the injection of tumor cells preexposed to plasma from chemotherapy-treated mice. Therefore, blocking or attenuating the activity of BMDCs in the
primary tumor and/or its metastases may decrease the potential development of new metastases.
The host-derived factors that can contribute to metastases following chemotherapy were not studied here. It has
been shown that tumor cells instigate BMDCs prior to their
mobilization to distant micrometastatic sites and therefore
can contribute to metastasis growth (38); in our study, we

solely tested the effects of chemotherapy that are host driven
with no involvement of tumor cells. Numerous factors have been
shown to be induced following therapy and can therefore
promote angiogenesis and metastases (39, 40). We recently
showed that an increase in plasma levels of SDF-1a and G-CSF,
both of which promote the mobilization of EPCs (41), was
observed in certain chemotherapy- and VDA-treated mice
(13, 14). Escalating doses of sunitinib, an antiangiogenic receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in non–tumor-bearing mice increased
plasma levels of G-CSF, SDF-1a, stem cell factor, and osteopontin (40). Metastases were accelerated in mice that undergo
short-term treatment with sunitinib (39). Do all anticancer
drugs cause tumorigenic effects? It seems that the inhibition
of MMP9 expression in paclitaxel-treated mice causes a reduction in metastasis, but this may not be so in combination with
other anticancer drugs. Collectively, the induction of metastasis
may be due, in part, to an increase in numerous host-derived
factors following therapy and therefore necessitates the identiﬁcation of those metastasis-accelerating factors.
In summary, this study was not designed to address the
question whether chemotherapy can accelerate metastases.
The clinical scenario would suggest that it does not actually do
so. However, our results point out on some reasons for the
explanation of why anticancer drugs may not be as effective as
predicted. According to our results, it seems that some chemotherapeutic drugs, in addition to their antitumor effects,
may also induce protumorigenic effects that may apparently
result from the host reaction to such a therapy. These negative
"side effects" of chemotherapy can promote tumor growth and
metastases likely due to an upregulation of tumor-promoting
factors. Therefore, adequate combinations of targeted therapies that prevent the occurrence of such responses to chemotherapy in the host may improve treatment outcome.
