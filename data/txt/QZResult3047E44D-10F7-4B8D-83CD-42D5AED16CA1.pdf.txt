Abstract
Androgen receptors have been shown to play a critical role in
prostate cancer. We used ultrasound imaging techniques to
track tumor response to antiandrogen and rapamycin
treatment in a prostate-specific Pten-deleted mouse model
of cancer. Depletion of androgens by either surgical or chemical castration significantly inhibited tumor growth progression without altering the activation of Akt and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR). We also showed for the first time
that targeting mTOR along with antiandrogen treatment
exhibited additive antitumor effects in vivo when compared
with single agents. Our preclinical data suggest that combination of antiandrogens with mTOR inhibitors might be more
effective in treating androgen-dependent prostate cancer
patients. [Cancer Res 2009;69(18):7466–72]

Introduction
The prevalence of prostate cancer is particularly high in
developed countries and is the third most common cause of
cancer-related deaths in men. Prevalence is now also increasing in
developing nations (1). It was predicted by the American Cancer
Society that in the United States alone, f192,280 men would be
diagnosed with prostate cancer and 27,360 deaths would be
attributed to prostate cancer this year. Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in men in the United States
with more than two million currently suffering from this disease.
Although the death rate from prostate cancer is decreasing with
the advent of early diagnosis, it still remains a leading cause of
cancer-related death in men. Currently available treatment
modalities include radical prostectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and androgen ablation therapy.
The sex hormone testosterone plays a central role in the normal
development and growth of male sex organs, as well as the
abnormal growth of prostate cancer, through the androgen
receptor (AR) signaling pathway (reviewed in ref. 2). Although
the mechanism of androgen dependence in prostate tumor growth

is not fully understood, the primary goal of treatment for prostate
cancer in the clinic is to achieve suppression or inhibition of AR
activation by androgen deprivation through surgical castration,
estrogen, antiandrogens, or their combination (reviewed in ref. 3).
Androgen ablation by either surgical castration or by luteinizing
hormone–releasing hormone analogue strongly inhibits the growth
of localized advanced cancer by eliminating circulating testosterone (4, 5). However, within only a few years after androgen ablation
therapy, prostate cancer growth in these patients tends to become
more aggressive as well as androgen-independent (reviewed in
ref. 6). The mechanism of developed resistance to antiandrogens
remains unclear, yet cell-based studies indicate that regulation of
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway by androgens may
play a critical role in the development of androgen independent
prostate cancer (7–9).
The PI3K pathway plays an important role in regulating several
cellular functions including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Loss or functional alteration of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN activates downstream PI3K signaling, resulting
in increased cell proliferation and survival (10–14). More than 20%
of primary human prostate cancer is associated with deletion or
functional loss of PTEN, whereas >50% of human metastatic prostate cancer specimens harbor biallelic loss of this gene, suggesting
that PTEN might be responsible for the lethal form of the disease
(15–24). Conventional deletion of both alleles of Pten leads to embryonic lethality (25, 26), whereas heterozygous Pten-null mice
develop prostate intraepithelial neoplasia or PIN. These mice have
been crossed with a number of other genetically engineered mice
for further enhancement of the tumor phenotype [reviewed in
Majumder and colleagues (27)]. Loss of function mutations or
lowered expression of PTEN increases the activity of important
downstream targets of PI3K such as AKT in various cell lines and
engineered mouse models (reviewed in refs. 28, 29). Activation of
AKT1 in the prostate alone induces development of PIN but not
invasive prostate cancer, whereas activation of AKT1 in a p27Kip1 null
setting as well as prostate-specific deletion of Pten induces invasive
cancer in mice (30–32). To understand the role of androgen ablation
in the context of PI3K pathway activation, we have used a genetically
engineered mouse model where Pten loxP/loxP mice (33) were crossed
with ARR2-Pb-Cre+ transgenic mice (34). These mice spontaneously
develop prostate tumors that recapitulate most human prostate
cancer characteristics (32). However, selection and enrollment of
these animals into a preclinical study are difficult due to the fact that
the anatomic location of these tumors prohibits standard caliper
measurements. Therefore, monitoring the kinetics of tumor
response to a therapy in live animals is challenging. Here, we evaluated the use of the translational three-dimension ultrasound

imaging technology to visualize and follow tumor development and
response to androgen deprivation treatments. We show that this
model is androgen dependent and that androgen blockade does not
affect the activation of Akt or mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR). We also show that simultaneous inhibition of mTOR and
androgen signaling induces better antitumor effect in this model.

Materials and Methods
Animals. A conditional Pten-deficient model of prostate cancer
(Pten loxp/loxp/Pb-Cre4) in which Pten is homozygously deleted in the prostate gland due to prostate-specific expression of Cre recombinase (32) was
used for these studies. This model was obtained from Dr. Hong Wu’s laboratory at the University of California in Los Angles, CA. Both founder lines,
the ARR2Probasin-Cre (C+) transgenic mice (on C57BL/6xDBA2 background; ref. 34) and the Pten Loxp/Loxp mice (on a 129/BALB/c background),
were maintained in our contract facility. The heterozygous Pten Loxp/+;C/+
males were then bred to Pten Loxp/Loxp females to obtain the Pten Loxp/loxp;C/+
genotype. Male Pten Loxp/loxp;C/+ mice between 14 and 76 wk of age were used
for experiments. Mice were using an isolated barrier unit system on wood-chip
bedding and fed standard rodent chow ad libitum. All animal procedures were
reviewed and approved by the Merck Research Laboratories-Boston Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
3-Dimensional ultrasound imaging of prostate tumors. Mice were
anaesthetized with a continuous flow of 2% to 3% isoflurane in oxygen
mixture (2.5 liters/min) in an induction chamber using the Vevo anesthesia
system (VisualSonics, Inc.). Mice were placed on the Vevo Mouse Handling
Table (37jC) in the Vevo Integrated Rail System (VisualSonics, Inc.) with
continuous isoflurane anesthesia. Mouse fur was removed before ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound coupling gel AQUASONIC 100 (Parker
Lab oratories, Inc.) was applied directly to the skin. Mice were then
scanned transversely from ventral body wall using the 710B real-time
microvisualization scanhead (probe) and Vevo770 High-resolution In vivo
Micro-Imaging system (VisualSonics, Inc.). The 710B scanhead provides a
center frequency at 20 MHz with 70 Am axial and 140 Am lateral resolution at
the focal depth of 15 mm. The stepsize of scanning varies from 32 to 48 Am
dependent on the scanning distance. The maximal field of view of the
scanhead is 20.8  20.8 mm and the maximal scanning distance is 24 mm.
Animals were scanned twice due to tumor growth in both anterior lobes of
the prostate. A single scan was insufficient to cover both tumors in the same
field of view. Three-dimensional images were reconstructed from twodimensional section images using the Vevo770 system software following
acquisition. Tumor volumes were determined using the three-dimensional
Quantify Version 3.5 software (Robarts Research Institute).
Animal surgery and treatment. Animals were prescreened by
ultrasound three-dimensional imaging to obtain a baseline tumor volume
for enrollment and were randomized into groups based on tumor volumes.
For studies using androgen ablation by surgical castration, 20 animals with
tumors 324 to 739 mm3 were randomized into two groups. Ten animals
were castrated by removal of both testicles following the standard operation
procedure of Merck Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols.
The other 10 animals were kept as controls. Mice were imaged weekly. Nine
weeks following castration, slow-releasing testosterone propionate pellets
(100 mg of 90-day-releasing pellet purchased from Innovative Research of
America) were implanted s.c. and ultrasound imaging resumed after a period
of 2 wk. Testosterone pellets were then removed 5 wk following implantation
and tumor kinetics were tracked for an additional 5 wk. Chemical castration
studies were conducted with Casodex at the dose of 10 mg/kg, daily for 5 d a
week (Monday to Friday). Tumor-bearing mice were also treated with
Rapamycin (LC Laboratories) alone at the dose of 20 mg/kg, daily (Monday to
Friday), or with the combination of Casodex + Rapamycin at their above
indicated doses, daily (Monday to Friday) or by 0.5% methyl cellulose (as
vehicle) for 8 wk. Mice were imaged weekly throughout treatment. BrdUrd
(Roche) was administered i.p. at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Mice were euthanized
and tumors were dissected, weighed, and processed for further analysis at the
conclusion of studies.

End point tumor assessment. Mice were euthanized using CO2 and
entire tumors were collected and weighed. Due to the variable amount of
fluid that the tumors in this model contain, net tumor weight was also
measured after fluid removal. Animals were euthanized and tumor samples
were collected when tumor volumes reached 10% of body weight or tumor
size was out of range of the ultrasound transducer before study termination.
Tumor samples were collected for histologic and biochemical analysis.
Plasma concentration of testosterone. Mice were euthanized using CO2
and 500 AL of blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Plasma was separated
by centrifugation for 1 min at 12,000  g and stored at 20jC for further
analysis. Testosterone levels in plasma were determined by established ELISA
per manufacture instruction (kit #KEG010; R&D Systems).
Histology and immunohistochemical analysis. Formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissues were sectioned at 5-Am thickness. Tissue sections were
stained with H&E (Fisher) and analyzed for cell proliferation [BrdUrd, 1:500
(BD Bioscience); Ki-67, 1:500, Clone SP6 (Lab Vision)]. The status of
phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein (1:75; Cell Signaling Technology), PTEN
(1:50; Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-AKT (S473; 1:50; Cell Signaling
Technology), and AR (1:150; Lab Vision) were also measured. Automated
staining was done using the ChromoMap kit on the Discovery XT (Ventana
Medical System, Inc.) under standard conditions. Ki67 or BrdUrd-positive
cells insides the ducts (not in the stromal compartment) of entire prostate
sections were counted manually and number of positive cells/ducts was
calculated.
Western blotting. Tumor samples were collected, flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at 80jC until processed. Frozen samples were
thawed in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer [0.5 mol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 1.5 mol/L NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10% NP40, 10 mmol/L
EDTA; Upstate USA, Inc.] containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Diagnostics Corporation). Or tumor samples were minced and
subsequently homogenized with the Qiagen bead tissue lyser. Protein
concentrations in cell and tissue lysates were determined by the
Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. All proteins were detected by resolving
proteins on Criterion 4-15% Tris-HCL SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories)
and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Residual binding sites were
blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk and blotted with antibodies against
phospho-AKT (S473; 1:1,000), phospho-S6RP (1:1,000; Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.), Amyloid Precursor Protein (1:1,000; Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.), h-Actin (1:2,000; Abcam Inc.), and Tubulin (1:1,000;
Abcam Inc.). Detection of protein bands was done using SuperSignal West
Pico and Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology) after
incubation with the horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody
(1:5,000; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc.).
Statistical analysis. A repeated measure ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test was conducted to evaluate statistically significant
differences of antitumor effects between groups.

Results
Detection of prostate tumors in Pten loxP/loxP;C+ mice using
noninvasive ultrasound imaging technology. For prostate
tumor volume determination, we used both ultrasound and
microcomputerized tomography imaging techniques (Supplementary Fig. S1). Fifty-five mice between 19 and 52 weeks of age were
imaged with Ultrasound, and tumors were dissected and weighed.
The smallest tumor was determined as 103 mm3. However, we have
observed that this imaging technology can detect and measure
much smaller tumors (data not shown). Tumor volumes measured
by three-dimensional analysis of ultrasound images correlated well
with the weights of fluid-containing tumors (R2 = 0.85; Supplementary Fig. S1). However, large tumors contained significant
amounts of fluid and the volume of fluid varied markedly among
tumors. Therefore, final tumor net weights showed less correlation
with the ultrasound volumes at R2 = 0.65. H&E staining confirmed

that all tumors were late stage invasive adenocarcinomas (Supplementary Fig. S1). Additionally, we were able to detect the tumor
in the same mice using microcomputerized tomography (Supplementary Fig. S1); however, it was difficult to quantify the tumor
volume due to the poor contrast between tumor and surrounding
genitourinary organs.
Analysis of 234 Pten loxP/loxP;C+ male mice between 20 and 76
weeks of age by ultrasound imaging showed that tumor development in this model is age dependent (Supplementary Fig. S2). All
233 animals eventually developed tumors with a minimum ultrasound volume of 12 mm3 to a maximum of 5,410 mm3 and one
animal never developed tumor was confirmed to be misgenotyped.
Tumor growth kinetics of 23 male mice over time was found to be
heterogeneous (Supplementary Fig. S3). Rapidly growing tumors
(16 of 23 mice) displayed doubling times of f1.3 to 4.9 weeks, whereas
slow growing tumors (5 of 23 mice) showed a 5.5 to 11.5 week doubling
time. Two tumors seemed to be static with an extended doubling time
of f19 to 20 weeks.
Increased expression of phospho-Akt (S473) and phospho-S6RP
in both early and late stages of tumor was associated with

complete elimination of Pten expression in the luminal epithelial
cells by both immunohistochemistry and Western analysis (data
not shown; Supplementary Fig. S2), although other cell types
remained Pten positive. Consistent with published report (32),
these data suggest the PI3K pathway is activated in tumors
irrespective of their age and size.
Prostate tumors in Pten Loxp/Loxp;C+ mice are sensitive to
antiandrogens. Androgen ablation has been the most common
approach for late stage prostate cancer treatment in the clinic.
However, hormonal deprivation therapy only remains effective for
f2 to 3 years, after which tumors develop resistance and become
hormone independent. To determine androgen dependency in the
Pten-deficient tumor model, 44 Pten–deficient male mice between
22 and 52 weeks of age were prescanned for enrollment. Twenty
mice with tumor volumes ranging from 324 to 739 mm3 (ages ranged
from 26–46 weeks) were selected for the studies and were randomly
assigned into two groups. One group was castrated by surgical
removal of both testicles and the second group was assigned as
controls (no surgical removal of testicles). Plasma testosterone level
was measured and data showed an approximate 87% decrease upon

Figure 1. Pten-deficient tumors are sensitive to antiandrogens. A, tumor response to orchidectomy and testosterone replacement. Prostate tumors in Pten-deficient
mice were imaged and the mice randomized into two groups (n = 10/group) based on tumor volume (f480 mm3). Mice in group 1 underwent bilateral castration
and those in group 2 were kept as controls. Tumors were imaged and volume was measured weekly. Testosterone pellets were implanted 9 wk following castration.
Testosterone pellets were removed at the end of week 15. Few mice as indicated by a, b, c, and d (2, 4, 1, and 1, respectively) were removed from the study due
to large tumor size. Tumor volume data at the time of removal was included for the duration of the study in the data analysis. Tumor growth was significantly (P < 0.001)
different at week 9 compared with week 1 in control mice, whereas no significant (NS ) tumor growth progression was observed between week 1 and week 9 in
castrated mice. However, significant (P < 0.05) tumor growth progression was observed when testosterone was administered in castrated mice at week 9. B, mice were
enrolled into two groups (n = 10/group) as per their tumor volume (f840 mm3). Mice received either Casodex or 0.5% Methylcellulose (vehicle) and were imaged
weekly. Percent change in tumor volume normalized to their baselines is depicted. Only mice that reached week 7 were included in the final data analysis. C, tumor
weight was measured and compared with the final ultrasound measurement. *, **, and ***, statistical significances at P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001 compared

Combinatorial Effect of mTOR Inhibitor and Antiandrogens

tumor cell proliferation without affecting the
activation of Akt or mTOR. Tumor-bearing
mice were surgically castrated or treated
Casodex for 9 wk. A, tumor sections
from noncastrated (control ) and surgically

antibody against AR, and Ki67. B, tumor

and Casodex-treated were stained with

surgical castration compared with noncastrated control mice
(Supplementary Fig. S4), which is consistent with published data
(35). Mice were imaged weekly by ultrasound following enrollment
into the study to monitor tumor volume. Within the first 2 weeks
following surgery, we observed tumor growth in the castrated mice
followed by tumor regression (Fig. 1A). By week 7, tumor volumes in
the castrated mice were significantly smaller compared with the
noncastrated controls (Fig. 1A). In human prostate cancer, some
prostate tumors deprived of hormone-driven growth become
independent and bypass the requirement for testosterone. To
determine whether these tumors remained androgen sensitive, we
implanted slow released (90 days) testosterone pellets (100 mg) in
the surgically castrated mice at 9 weeks postsurgery. Androgen
complementation resulted in tumor growth in as little as 2 weeks
following testosterone implantation (Fig. 1A). Tumor volumes
significantly increased from 586 mm3 (week 9) to 1,147 mm3
(week 15) after 6 weeks of testosterone treatment and no statistically
significant difference was observed between the treatment and
vehicle groups (Fig. 1A). The testosterone pellets were subsequently
removed to further confirm androgen dependency of these tumors.
Tumor growth was again significantly inhibited 3 weeks after the
removal of testosterone pellets in castrated animals (Fig. 1A).
Tumors were harvested and the level of androgen target was
analyzed to determine the biological effects of androgens. Besides
down-regulation of AR, data also showed that the level of amyloid
precursor protein, another androgen target (36), was decreased
(f50%) in these tumors when mice were surgically castrated
(Supplementary Fig. S4; Fig. 2A).
To compare the effects of surgical castration to chemical
castration in this model, we used the AR blocker Casodex to
inhibit AR signaling. Animals with tumors ranging from 108 to
1,458 mm3 were enrolled and treated with either vehicle (n = 9) or
Casodex (n = 10) at 10 mg/kg. Due to significant tumor volumetric
variations, percent change of tumor volume was used to normalize
tumor growth. Additionally, as a result of unexpected animal death
(not related to the toxicity of Casodex) or tumor size out of range
of detection ( five each group) in first 3 weeks, only mice that
reached week 7 were included in the final data analysis. Data
showed that Casodex (n = 5) significantly inhibits tumor growth
progression (only 4% increase compared with base level), whereas
in the control (n = 4), tumor volume was increased 208% (com-

pared with the base level) in 7 weeks (Fig. 1B). Mice were euthanized at the end of both studies (surgical castrations and
chemical castration) and tumor weight was measured. Data
showed a tumor net weight reduction along with a significant
reduction in ultrasound measured volume following either surgical
castration or Casodex treatment (Fig. 1C).
Activation of Akt/mTOR pathway remained unaffected by
antiandrogens treatment. Androgen blockade significantly
inhibited the progression of tumor growth in this model, but did
not result in a complete tumor regression. To further explore tumor
signaling pathways in this model, we focused on the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling pathway. Published data suggests that androgen
blockade increases the activation of Akt and causes androgenrefractory status in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (37).
In contrast, Hara and colleagues (38) suggested that activated Akt
is not necessary for the invasiveness of androgen-refractory MDA-I
prostate cancer cells. We analyzed tumors treated with either
Casodex or surgical castration by H&E and immunohistochemistry.
Here, we find that residual tumors have less AR-positive cells or
lower level of nuclear AR in castrated mice compared with
noncastrated controls (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, BrdUrd labeling and
Ki-67 staining of these tumors suggested that these treated tumors
were less proliferative (114.82 Ki67-positive cells/duct in noncastrated prostate versus 44.06 Ki67-positive cells/duct in castrated
prostate; data not shown; Fig. 2A). However, no significant changes
in caspase activation or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end labeling–positive cells were observed
(data not shown). Adjacent tumor sections were also analyzed for
changes in phospho-AKT (S473) and phospho-S6RP. Results
revealed no change in the intensity of staining for either of these
proteins, suggesting that both Akt and mTOR remain activated
following androgen blockade by surgical castration (Fig. 2B). To
test whether surgical and chemical castrations have different
impact on the activation of Akt and mTOR, tumors treated with
Casodex were stained with phospho-AKT (S473) and phosphoS6RP. Results indicated that Casodex also had no effect on the
activation of Akt and mTOR in this model (Fig. 2B).
Combination of mTOR inhibitor and antiandrogen treatment
shows additive antitumor efficacy. AR signaling and PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathways are active in a subset of human prostate cancer.
Our data showed that AR and PI3K signaling pathways are

independently involved in tumor growth (Fig. 2), suggesting that
simultaneously inhibition of both pathways may result in a better
therapeutic response. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with either
vehicle, Casodex, Rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor), or a combination of Rapamycin and Casodex for a duration of 9 weeks. Tumors
were measured once per week and tumor volumes were calculated.
Significant antitumor effects of the combination group were seen
as early as week 7, whereas tumor volumes of vehicle, Casodex,
Rapamycin, and combination-treated mice were 1,154 + 112, 745 +
107, 637 + 128, and 417 + 129 mm3, respectively. At 9 weeks, tumor
volumes were further reduced in the combination group (411+138)
compared with vehicle (1,366 + 141), Casodex (805 + 137), and
Rapamycin (680 + 136) groups. Data show a significant additive
antitumor effect when mice were treated with the combination of
Rapamycin and Casodex (Fig. 3A and B). Mice were euthanized and
tumor weights were measured at the end of the study. Tumor
weight data correlated with ultrasound measurements and display
an additive effect when Rapamycin was combined with Casodex
(Fig. 3C). Similarly, combination of surgical castration and mTOR
inhibitor also reduced tumor burden compared with castrated
tumors (Fig. 3D). Together, these data suggest additive antitumor
efficacy is observed when antiandrogens are combined with mTOR

inhibitor. To verify that the resulting efficacy was in response to the
combination, we evaluated the effect of antiandrogens and mTOR
inhibitors on their respective targets by immunohistochemical analysis of tumors collected 4 hours after the last dose of the efficacy
study as shown in Fig. 3A. Casodex alone reduced nuclear AR levels
or less AR-positive cells, whereas mTOR activity remains unaffected
(Fig. 4, column 2). Rapamycin alone completely inhibited phosphorylation of S6RP, whereas AR was not affected (Fig. 4, column 3).
Combination treatment with Casodex and Rapamycin inhibited
both AR and phospho-S6RP levels (Fig. 4, column 4). BrdUrd staining
showed that inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by either antiandrogen or mTOR inhibitor was further enhanced by the combination (Fig. 4, row 4). Together, these data show that inhibition
of tumor cell proliferation by blocking both pathways enhanced
therapeutic efficacy.

Discussion
Application of more clinically relevant preclinical cancer models
will enhance the probability of success for identification, evaluation, and development of new drug candidates for the treatment of
cancer patients. Noninvasive imaging technology enable accurate

differences. Between-group tests always subtract baseline group difference. C, mice were euthanized and tumor weight was measured and mean + SEM is

(noncastrated ; n = 6) and castrated mice (n = 6) received vehicle for 8 wk and castrated mice (n = 6) received Casodex for 8 wk. Mice were euthanized and
tumor weight was measured and mean + SEM is plotted.

discovery programs. Ultrasound imaging technology was used to
detect prostate tumors in the TGMAP mouse model (39, 40).
However, these techniques have not been used in complex models
that recapitulate human disease (such as Pten null mice). Here, we
show that ultrasound measurements display significant correlations with actual tumor weights. We successfully show that high
frequency ultrasound imaging provides a unique tool for sensitive
detection of mouse prostate tumors that enables prestudy randomization based on tumor volumes and this is the first application of this imaging technique to monitor tumor progression and
response to a therapy.
Tumor heterogeneity is crucial for progression, metastasis, and
responsiveness to therapeutic modalities in the clinic and there
are few animal models that can accurately mimic the nature of
these tumors. With noninvasive imaging technologies, we have
shown that following deletion of Pten, tumors in this model
developed with heterogeneity and progression, which varied from
tumor to tumor (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). Intratumor
heterogeneity was also observed in this model by histologic
analysis. For instance, the ratio of epithelial and stromal
compartments in different sections of tumors varied and their
rates of proliferation and activation of Akt or S6RP are heterogeneous, which resembles the human disease (data not shown;
Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 32).
It has been reported that early stage microscopic invasive
adenocarcinoma can be detected at 16 weeks of age in the Pten
null mouse model and they respond to castration with increasing
apoptosis (32). However, residual invasive adenocarcinomas were
still evident 2.5 months (10 weeks) after surgical castration (32). It
has been suggested that Pten null prostate cancer cells can adapt
to their new environment and become androgen independent (32).
Our data suggest that tumors cells become less proliferative after

androgen ablation compared with control but they remain sensitive
to androgens (Figs. 1 and 2). When androgen was restored by
implantation of testosterone pellets in the surgically castrated mice,
the tumor growth progression resumed at a similar rate as the
control animals (Fig. 1A). However, it is possible that 9 weeks of
androgen ablation was insufficient to deplete the entire population
of androgen dependent tumor cells and the remaining androgendependent tumor cells were still sensitive to testosterone (Fig. 1A).
The molecular mechanism underlying the initiation of androgen
refractory prostate cancer is relatively unknown. PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling pathways play a major role in the initiation and progression of these tumors in many preclinical mouse models, and
cell-based data suggest that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
network is also responsible for the development of androgen
refractory tumors. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in
any relevant preclinical models. Here, we show that Pten null
prostate tumors are sensitive to antiandrogen treatment and remain androgen dependent without affecting the activation of Akt
and mTOR (Fig. 2B). However, it might be possible for some tumors
to escape after long-term treatment with antiandrogens in this model.
These data suggest that the activation of the Akt or mTOR signaling
network may not be the sole factor driving the development of an
androgen refractory state when treated with antiandrogens.
Antiandrogens or complete androgen blockade and conventional chemotherapeutic approaches are effective in androgendependent prostate cancer (41). However, these agents do not
result in complete tumor regression and clearance. Similarly, it
has been shown that mTOR inhibitors reverse Pten/Akt/mTORmediated neoplasia and reduce tumor volumes in engineered
mice (12, 13, 42). More recently, Kinkade and colleagues (43) and
Carracedo and colleagues (44) reported that the combination of
PI3K pathway inhibitor with extracellular signal-regulated kinase/
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling inhibitor might be
more useful in preclinical models of hormone refractory prostate

cancer. We have shown that combination of a PI3K pathway inhibitor
with antiandrogen shows an additive benefit compared with any
single agent alone in this mouse model of prostate cancer (Fig. 3). Our
data indicate a rationale for combinational strategies of androgen
blockade with either Akt and/or mTOR inhibition for further
exploration in clinic.
In summary, high frequency ultrasound imaging is a very useful
technique to randomize and monitor tumor growth progression of
prostate cancer in the Pten loxP/loxP;C+ model. Ultrasound as a method
of tracking tumor progression enables a generalized application of
these techniques in genetic mouse models for evaluation of
preclinical drug candidates. The Pten null prostate tumor model
resembles androgen-dependent prostate cancer in patients and
responds to complete androgen blockade. In addition, activation of
the Akt and mTOR pathway remained unchanged after chronic
