Abstract
Adenomatous tumors in the middle ear and temporal bone are rare but highly
morbid because they are difficult to detect prior to the development of audiovestibular
dysfunction. Complete resection is often disfiguring and difficult because of location
and the late stage at diagnosis, so identification of molecular targets and effective
therapies is needed. Here, we describe a new mouse model of aggressive papillary
ear tumor that was serendipitously discovered during the generation of a mouse
model for mutant EGFR-driven lung cancer. Although these mice did not develop lung
tumors, 43% developed head tilt and circling behavior. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scans showed bilateral ear tumors located in the tympanic cavity. These tumors
expressed mutant EGFR as well as active downstream targets such as Akt, mTOR
and ERK1/2. EGFR-directed therapies were highly effective in eradicating the tumors
and correcting the vestibular defects, suggesting these tumors are addicted to EGFR.
EGFR activation was also observed in human ear neoplasms, which provides clinical
relevance for this mouse model and rationale to test EGFR-targeted therapies in these
rare neoplasms.

INTRODUCTION

tumors.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is
a cell surface protein, and functions as a tyrosine kinase
to transduce signals across the plasma membrane into
the cytoplasm to promote cell growth and proliferation.
Somatic mutations of EGFR in exon 21 (e.g., L858R)
and exon 19 deletions have frequently been identified in
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are
frequently non-smokers [11]. These mutations are gainof-function and enhance autophosphorylation of EGFR,
which increases activation of downstream pathways
such as the PI3K/Akt pathway and MEK/ERK pathway.
EGFR-mutant lung cancers are highly sensitive to EGFRspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [12]. During the
generation of a mouse model for mutant EGFR-driven
lung cancer [13], we serendipitously discovered a new
genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of aggressive
papillary ear tumor. EGFR-directed therapies corrected
vestibular defects, induced ear tumor regression, and
inhibited EGFR. Combined with the detection of active
EGFR in human specimens of aggressive papillary ear
tumors, these studies identify EGFR as a new molecular
target for these rare ear neoplasms.

Adenomatous tumors in the middle ear and temporal
bone, especially mastoid and petrous portions, are rare [1].
Because of this rarity, they lack molecular characterization
and effective chemotherapies. The anatomic and cellular
origin of aggressive papillary tumors in the middle ear
and temporal bone has not been clear. In 1989, Heffner
proposed that temporal bone tumors that have low grade
papillary adenocarcinomatous features originate in the
endolymphatic sac [2]. Endolymphatic sac tumors (ELST)
are defined as non-metastasizing adenocarcinomas of
endolymphatic sac origin, but can often invade the petrous
bone even though they are slow growing [1]. At early
stages, ELSTs are typically confined within the region of
the vestibular aqueduct, whereas later stage tumors destroy
much of petrous bone including the apical part and invade
into the middle ear [1, 3]. Although sporadic cases of
ELST are commonly unilateral and occur with or without
somatic mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene
[4, 5], bilateral ELSTs are a frequent manifestation of VHL
disease [6]. Histopathologically, ELSTs are described
as variable papillary-glandular adenocarcinomas of low
histological grade, with cystic spaces and vascular papillae
[7].
Although ELSTs show petrous temporal bone
erosion, there are several reports that describe aggressive
papillary tumors as filling the tympanic cavity and mastoid
segment of the middle ear without involvement of the
petrous temporal bone [3, 8, 9]. Tysome et al. reviewed
24 previous reported cases of aggressive papillary tumors
in the middle ear and temporal bone. Twenty two cases
showed invasion of the apical petrous temporal bone on
imaging, suggesting that they arose from primary ELSTs.
On the other hand, both in Tysome’s case and the 2 others
reported, there was no involvement of the petrous temporal
bone at all, indicating the possibility that these aggressive
papillary tumors that are confined to the middle ear and
mastoid may be an entity separate from the ELSTs [3].
It remains controversial whether all aggressive papillary
middle ear tumors are classified as ELSTs.
Surgical resection is the primary treatment of
aggressive papillary tumors in the middle ear and temporal
bone [10]. Early diagnosis is essential for a curative,
complete excision. However, they are difficult to detect at
an early stage and may present with severe audiovestibular
or facial nerve dysfunction. In such cases, complete
resection is often difficult because of the anatomic site
and the late stage at diagnosis. The development of
effective chemotherapies or targeted therapies as adjuvant
or neoadjuvant treatments is desirable, because such
treatments could shrink the tumor prior to surgery or treat
patients with aggressive, unresectable tumors. This process
would be expedited by the development of a mouse model
that mimics human ear tumors and the identification of
the molecular drivers in the mouse model and human ear

RESULTS
A new mouse model of aggressive papillary ear
tumor
A human surfactant protein C (SP-C) was used as a
lung-specific gene promoter to drive tetracycline-inducible
expression of mutant EGFRL858R+T790M (mEGFRL+T) [13].
After 10 weeks, a subset of SP-C/mEGFRL+T mice
exhibited head tilt with or without circling behavior,
which was independent of doxycycline administration
(Figure 1A, Movies S1 and S2, and Figure S1A). As the
mouse colony expanded and this phenotype continued to
be observed, doxycycline was omitted. At a median age
25.3 weeks (range: 11.4-55.1 weeks), 108 of 251 SP-C/
mEGFRL+T mice (43.0%) developed head tilt (Figure 1B).
MRI scans showed bilateral ear tumors that were located
in the tympanic cavity posterior to the cochlea (Figure 1C
and Movies S3 and S4), which suggested the presence
of tumors of the middle ear or ELSTs. Micro-computed
tomography (CT) images of the chest from SP-C/
mEGFRL+T mice bearing ear tumors did not show lung
tumors (Figure S1B), which was confirmed by autopsy
and pathological analysis (data not shown).
Examination of a decalcified skull from a mouse
with head tilt showed bilateral ear tumors in the tympanic
cavity (Figure 1D). Histopathology revealed low-grade
(i.e., differentiated) papillary adenomatous ear tumors
that were characterized by papillomatous proliferation
with a single layer of cuboidal-polygonal epithelial cells

with a mucinous appearance in the apical portion of the
cytoplasm (Figures 1E and 1F), acinar formation (Figure
1G), and a highly vascularized stroma (Figure 1H).
Mitotic Figures were not seen, but the papillary tumors
had invaded the nerve sheath outside of the tympanic
cavity (Figure S1C), the cochlea, and the tympanic bulla
(Figure S1D), which are features of malignant tumors
(i.e., carcinoma). Mucin 1, also known as epithelial
membrane antigen (EMA), was expressed in the papillary
adenomatous ear tumors, indicating that these tumors
are epithelial neoplasms (Figure 1I). On the other hand,
thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1 or NKx2.1) was not
expressed in ear tumors, indicating that these tumors were

not metastatic from lung or thyroid tissues (Figure 1J).
To clarify if these tumors originate from the
endolymphatic duct/sac or epithelial cells in the tympanic
cavity within the petrous portion of temporal bone, high
resolution 3D-MRI scans of heads from asymptomatic
SP-C/mEGFRL+T mice were performed. As shown in
Figure S2, endolymphatic ducts were clearly followed
from the distal to proximal portion (Figures S2A to S2I)
without evidence of ELST. Next, serial histological
thin sections of ear tissues from asymptomatic SP-C/
mEGFRL+T mice were examined. Although ear tumors
were identified in the tympanic cavity, there was no
evidence of proliferating cells in the intraosseous part

of the endolymphatic duct/sac (Figure S3). These data
suggest that these epithelial ear neoplasms are primary
aggressive papillary adenocarcinomas that likely originate
from epithelial cells in the tympanic cavity, which cause
vestibular dysfunction manifest as head tilt and circling
behavior.

ineffective as single agents (data not shown). Cetuximab
alone decreased ear tumor volume by 32.9% (p< 0.0001;
Figure 3A). The combination of cetuximab with erlotinib
reduced tumor volume by 42.6% (p=0.0002; Figure 3B).
Afatinib in combination with cetuximab reduced tumor
volume by 67% (p=0.0004; Figure 3C) and normalized
head tilt and gait as shown in Movies S1 (before treatment)
and S5 (after treatment). These results indicate that FDAapproved agents such as cetuximab alone or combinations
of cetuximab with FDA-approved EGFR TKI can reduce
tumor volume and mitigate the phenotype in mice with
mEGFRL+T-driven ear tumors.
Because WZ4002 can inhibit EGFR and shrink
mEGFRL+T-driven lung tumors [13, 15], ear tumor-bearing
mice were treated with WZ4002. These mice had a 60%
reduction in ear tumor volume (p=0.0001; Figure 3D),
with improvement in their circling behavior as shown in
Movies S2 (before treatment) and S6 (after treatment),
which is similar to the effects of afatinib combined with
cetuximab. All mice treated with cetuximab and afatinib or
erlotinib, or with WZ4002 alone, showed partial responses
(PR), as well as 2/3 mice treated with cetuximab alone
(Figure 3E and Table S1), which correlated with the
inhibition of EGFR (Figure S5), whereas mice treated
with afatinib or erlotinib alone showed progressive
disease (PD). Taken together, these data indicate that
ear tumors in SP-C/mEGFRL+T mice are dependent upon
EGFR activation, and that EGFR inhibitors can have
pharmacodynamic effects in tumors that are located in the
middle ear.

Activation of EGFR and the downstream
pathways in ear tumors
Because ear tumors developed in SP-C/mEGFRL+T
mice, but not in lung Clara-cell CCSP-driven mutant
EGFR mice, we hypothesized that the expression of
both SP-C and mEGFRL+T might be involved in ear
tumorigenesis. To test this hypothesis, we resected
ear tumors macroscopically (Figure S4) and assessed
expression of both proteins by immunoblotting. Mutant
EGFR was selectively expressed in the ear tumors,
whereas SP-C was expressed in both ear tumors and
grossly normal lung tissue (Figure 2A), suggesting
that SP-C-driven rtTA induces mEGFRL+T-driven
tumorigenesis in the ear. To visualize SP-C expression
in ear epithelium, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis
was performed. Even at an antibody dilution of 1:10,000,
SP-C was clearly detected in ciliated cells in the tympanic
cavity and ear tumors, as well as alveolar epithelial
cells in the lung that served as a control (Figure 2B).
These findings suggest that expression of SP-C in ear
epithelium induces mEGFRL+T protein, which causes ear
tumorigenesis. Next, we evaluated activation of EGFR
and downstream pathways in the ear tumors. IHC analysis
showed expression of mutant EGFR in the tumors (Figure
2C). Increased phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream
components such as Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) and extracellular signal regulated kinase1/2
(ERK1/2: classical mitogen-activated protein kinase1/2)
was observed in tumors vs. surrounding stroma (Figures
2D to 2H), suggesting that ear tumor development was
dependent upon activation of EGFR and downstream
pathways, and that EGFR inhibitors might be beneficial
for ear tumor treatment.

Activated EGFR in human adenocarcinomas of
the middle ear and ELSTs
To assess the possible clinical relevance of our
preclinical studies, activation of EGFR was assessed
in human adenocarcinomas of the middle ear (Figures
4A and 4B) and ELSTs (Figure 4C). IHC analysis was
performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues
with phospho-specific and native antibody against EGFR.
Cell pellets from H1975 cells that have an EGFR T790M
mutation were treated with WZ4002 or vehicle and used
as controls (Figure 4D). These human adenocarcinomas
of the middle ear and ELSTs displayed EGFR activation.
Despite this activation, sequencing of exons 19-21 of
EGFR in the 2 human adenocarcinomas of the middle ear
did not reveal activating or resistance mutations (data not
shown), suggesting other mechanism for EGFR activation.
The detection of active EGFR in these specimens raises
the possibility that EGFR-targeted therapies might have
clinical efficacy in these rare ear neoplasms.

Regression of ear tumors by EGFR inhibitors
Although mice with lung tumors driven by
mEGFRL+T are resistant to reversible EGFR TKIs
used as single agents such as erlotinib or afatinib,
combinations of EGFR-directed therapies can decrease
expression of EGFR and tumor size [14]. Therefore, we
performed a series of studies with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved EGFR inhibitors
(erlotinib, a first generation TKI; afatinib, a second
generation TKI; and cetuximab, an EGFR antibody) or an
experimental third generation TKI (WZ4002) used singly
or in combination (Table S1). Erlotinib or afatinib were

that initiates and maintains the neoplastic process in our
mouse model, and is activated in human adenocarcinomas
of the middle ear and ELSTs. Although we demonstrated
that EGFR inhibitors can be effective in this model
system, the fact that the mutant transgenic EGFR in this
mouse model propagates EGFR activation to Akt, mTOR,
and ERK1/2, suggests that inhibitors of these kinases
might also have a role in these tumors. Thus, this mouse
model could be used to assess different therapies to treat
or prevent development of these ear tumors.
The SP-C/mEGFRL+T mice model the human
condition in several ways. First, mice become symptomatic
due to vestibular dysfunction, which is observed in
humans. Second, we found no evidence for metastasis of
the murine ear tumors, which is similar to human tumors
that rarely metastasize. Third, the cell of origin is unclear
in our model, which mimics the controversy regarding
cell of origin in human specimens. Finally, if additional
oncogenic drivers are discovered in human ear tumor
specimens, it is possible that relevant mouse models
could be generated by using the SP-C promoter to drive
expression of the human oncogenic driver.
The expression and activation of EGFR in this
mouse model is probably controlled at different levels.
For example, expression of mutant EGFR protein in ear
tumors from SP-C/mEGFRL+T mice was independent
of doxycycline administration (Figures 2A and 2C),
indicating that this genetic system has leaky expression
and/or that SP-C is expressed in ear epithelium. The
leakiness of the SP-C promoter system was demonstrated
by Perl et al., who assessed the inducibility of reporter
gene expression in transgenic mice bearing SP-C-rtTA
or Ccsp-rtTA ‘activator’ transgenes and a tetO-luciferase
‘target’ gene. Luciferase activity in the absence of
doxycycline was only detected in SP-C-rtTA/tetO-Luc
mice, but not CCSP-rtTA/tetO-Luc mice [16]. These
findings were consistent with their other observations that
doxycycline-independent expression of fibroblast growth
factor-7 (FGF-7) was observed in SP-C-rtTA/tetO-FGF-7
mice [17]. Although leakiness is possible in this system,
tumors were not observed in lung tissues or other tissues
in the absence of doxycycline, suggesting that local
expression of SP-C contributed to transgene induction.
Indeed, we found that SP-C protein was expressed in
ciliated cells of the mouse tympanic cavity and in ear
tumors (Figure 2B), even though expression of SP-C
was previously thought to be restricted to alveolar type
II epithelial cells [18], Expression of SP-C in middle ear
epithelium in our study is supported by the detection of
SP-C mRNA in adult rabbit middle ear tissue [19]. Taken
together, our results indicate that SP-C is expressed in not
only mouse alveolar epithelial cells but also in middle ear
epithelium, resulting in the induction of mutant EGFR and
ear tumorigenesis.
How is EGFR activated in these middle ear tumors?
Although this model is based on SP-C driven expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of a transgene with two different EGFR mutations (one
that confers sensitivity to first generation EGFR TKI
(L858R) and one that confers resistance (T790M)), it
is not clear that either or both mutations are required to
cause these tumors. Although other GEM models that
utilize overexpression of EGFR or other mutations driven
by SP-C might phenocopy this model, ear tumors have
not been reported in other murine models of EGFR-driven
lung tumors, including studies by Ohashi et al., who did
not report ear tumor development in their SP-C L858R
mice [20]. It is possible that the short latency of lung
tumors induced by mutant EGFR in these studies may
have masked development of ear tumors that would have
occurred had the mice lived longer. Although activated
EGFR was detected by IHC in human adenocarcinomas
of the middle ear (Figures 4A and 4B), we found no
mutations in EGFR, suggesting that other mechanisms for
EGFR activation. We were not able to perform gene copy
analysis of EGFR because of the limited sample volume,
but EGFR gene amplification is a potential mechanism for
EGFR activation, because amplification and activation
of EGFR has been reported in tumors from patients with
glioblastoma multiform (GBM), NSCLC, and breast
cancer [21, 22]. Human GBM xenograft tumors with
amplification of wild-type EGFR show overexpression
and higher activation of EGFR and invasive behavior
compared to these without amplification [23]. Ligand
dependent activation of EGFR could also contribute.
For example, although the mechanism of action by
which EGFR is activated in ELSTs from patients with
VHL remains to be determined, loss of VHL increases
levels of the EGFR ligand, TGF-α [21], and activates
EGFR in renal cancer cells [24]. Similarly, silencing of
EGFR decreases VHL-dependent renal cancer growth
[25]. To assess the status of VHL in ear tumors from
SP-C/mEGFRL+T mice, we sequenced exons 1-3 in the
mouse Vhl gene located on chromosome 6, and found no
evidence of Vhl gene deficiency in these tumors (data not
shown). These findings imply that a more comprehensive
approach could identify the mechanisms by which EGFR
is activated in human middle ear tumors, which could help
direct therapeutic approaches.
Regardless of the mechanism by which it is
activated, EGFR was effectively inhibited by a variety of
EGFR-directed therapies in our studies, which improved
the vestibular phenotype caused by the tumors. This has
clinical implications. Although complete resection of
aggressive papillary tumors of the middle ear or ELSTs
can be curative [10], there is a need for medical therapies
because the locally aggressive nature makes gross
resection difficult without jeopardizing critical structures
such as the inner ear, facial nerve, and great vessels at
the skull base. Combining medical therapies with partial
resection might allow for effective tumor control in
patients with large tumors. In our preclinical studies,
EGFR TKIs and/or an antibody against EGFR were

for ear tumor treatment with EGFR inhibitors, 3 mice
bearing ear tumors were prepared for each regimen to do
experimental replicates and analyze statistical data. The
efficacy of regimen was assessed by radiological approach
before and after each treatment, which was blinded to the
investigators before measuring ear tumor volume. The
primary end point was response rate assessed by criteria
to classify tumor responses to drug treatment as described
in Supplementary Materials and Methods. When mice
showed partial response (PR) or progressive disease
(PD), the treatment was stopped, and then the mice were
euthanized for further analysis. Once a mouse showed
severe vestibular dysfunction resulting in abnormal/
reduced mobility and/or drug-induced toxicity (e.g., rapid
weight loss or debilitating diarrhea), it was euthanized.
To confirm clinical relevance of our preclinical studies
in this project, a series of human ear neoplasms was
analyzed for phosphorylation of EGFR, which validates
our translational research.

effective against aggressive papillary adenocarcinomas
that were located into the tympanic cavity and bulla, which
correlated with inhibition of EGFR (Figure 3 and Figure
S5). This indicates that EGFR-targeted therapies can be
delivered to the complicated structures of the middle ear
and temporal bones, raising the possibility that ineffective
drug delivery might not limit human application of EGFRtargeted therapies for ear tumors. Our treatment studies
showed that combinations of cetuximab with afatinib
or erlotinib were superior to these single agents for the
treatment of mEGFRL+T-driven ear tumors (Figure 3E),
which is consistent with prior results for the treatment
of mEGFRL+T-driven lung tumors [14]. Combining
cetuximab with afatinib or erlotinib is well tolerated, and
the maximum tolerated doses of these combinations have
already been established in Phase I clinical trials [26, 27].
Moreover, our results confirmed that WZ4002, showed
similar efficacy to the combination of cetuximab with
afatinib (Figures 3C and 3D). If further analysis of clinical
ear tumor specimens shows non-mutational activation
of EGFR, it is possible that EGFR inhibitors that were
ineffective in our preclinical studies such as erlotinib
or cetuximab might be effective clinically. Use of such
drugs as single agents could mitigate toxicities associated
with other EGFR inhibitors. The availability of multiple
EGFR inhibitors for clinical trials might allow creative
trial design that could incorporate novel sequences and
combination of EGFR-directed therapies.
In summary, we characterized a novel mouse
model and human ear tumor specimens to identify EGFR
as a molecular target for aggressive ear tumors. The
effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors in this mouse model
supports clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors in humans
with aggressive ear tumors. Given the readily availability
of these FDA approved agents, EGFR inhibitors can be
repurposed to meet an unmet medical need for these
highly morbid but rare tumors.

EGFRL858R+T790M transgene; “L858R+T790M”) has been
previously described [28]. Mice with EGFRL858R+T790M
were subsequently crossed to surfactant protein C (SPC)-reverse tetracycline responsive transactivator (rtTA)
transgenic mice that were provided from Dr. Jeffrey A.
Whitsett (University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,
Cincinnati, OH, USA). Both transgenic mice were on an
FVB background. EGFR and SP-C-rtTA genotype was
assessed by PCR from tail clips [29, 30]. Bitransgenic
mice harboring both SP-C-rtTA and EGFRL858R+T790M
(SP-C/mEGFRL+T) were used in this ear tumor study.
The generation of mouse lung-specific tumor model
(harboring the Clara cell secretory protein (Ccsp)rtTA and tet-regulated EGFRL858R+T790M transgenes; “C/
L858R+T790M”) has been previously described [13, 28].
The expression of mEGFRL+T was assessed by IB and IHC
with an antibody to EGFR (L858R mutant specific, 43B2).
All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free housing
with NIH-31 regular diet and autoclaved water ad libidum.

MATERIALS & METHODS
Study design
The objective of this study was to develop a
therapeutic drug for non-surgical therapy to human
ear neoplasms. We performed preclinical studies with
molecular targeted anticancer agents using an ear tumor
mouse model, and evaluated a potential of molecular
targeted therapy in human adenomatous ear tumors. First,
we collected mice with head tilt or any sign of other
vestibule dysfunction and then assessed ear lesions by
radiological and histopathological approaches. Next the
ear lesions were characterized by immunoblotting (IB)
and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses to develop
a therapeutic drug. In a series of preclinical studies

Ear tumor treatment study
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were
performed on SP-C/mEGFRL+T mice with head tilt, and
then ear tumor-bearing mice were treated with EGFR
inhibitors. Afatinib and erlotinib were suspended in
vehicle (0.5% Carboxymethylcellulose: Sigma C4888) and
administrated by gavage at 20 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg once

a day, daily for 7 days, respectively. Cetuximab (1 mg/
mouse every 3 days for 7 days, i.e., day 1, 4, and 7) was
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) as described previously
[14]. WZ4002 was formulated in vehicle (10% 1-Methyl2-pyrrolidinone and 90% Polyethylene glycol-300 from
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and administrated by gavage
at 50 mg/kg twice a day, daily for 5 days as described
previously [13]. Combining cetuximab with afatinib or
erlotinib was administrated on each drug’s schedule. All
mice treated with EGFR inhibitors were rescanned by
MRI to assess ear tumor regression. Response rate was
evaluated by the criteria as described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods. To examine the effects of EGFR
inhibitors on biomarkers, ear tumor-bearing mice were
given one dose of vehicle or combining cetuximab with
afatinib or erlotinib, or given two doses of vehicle or
WZ4002 using the same doses described above. Mouse
skulls were extracted 3 hours after last administration.
Mice and the weight were monitored daily while on study
as well as diarrhea by visual inspection of fecal materials.
