BACKGROUND: The long-term efficacy of a combination of chemotherapy and dasatinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome–
positive (Ph1) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is not well established. METHODS: Patients received dasatinib with 8 cycles of
alternating hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone and high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate. Patients in complete remission (CR) continued maintenance dasatinib, vincristine, and prednisone for 2 years, which was followed by dasatinib indefinitely. Patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) received it during their first CR.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with a median age of 55 years (range, 21-80 years) were treated; 69 (96%) achieved CR. Among
them, 57 (83%) achieved cytogenetic CR after 1 cycle, and 64 (93%) achieved a major molecular response at a median of 4 weeks
(range, 2-38 weeks). Sixty-five patients (94%) were negative for minimal residual disease assessed by flow cytometry at a median of
3 weeks (range, 2-37 weeks). Dasatinib-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events included bleeding, pleural/pericardial effusions, and elevated transaminases. With a median follow-up of 67 months (range, 33-97 months), 33 patients (46%) were alive, and 30 (43%) were
in CR; 12 underwent allogeneic SCT. Thirty-nine patients died (3 at induction, 19 after relapse, 7 after SCT performed during first CR,
and 10 during CR). The median disease-free survival and overall survival were 31 (range, 0.3-97 months) and 47 months (range, 0.2-97
months), respectively. Seven relapsed patients had BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, including 4 with T315I. CONCLUSIONS: A
combination of chemotherapy with dasatinib is effective in achieving long-term remission for patients with newly diagnosed

INTRODUCTION
The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized the management of a number of hematological
malignancies and has changed the natural history of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.1 The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) is also detected in approximately a third of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with an
even higher incidence among older patients.2 Early trials demonstrated the high efficacy of TKIs in patients with relapsed
Ph 1 ALL even as monotherapy.3,4 However, it was clear that despite their potency, these agents were likely associated
with more durable responses when they were administered together with combination chemotherapy regimens designed
for patients with ALL.5-7 Dasatinib has been used for both salvage and initial therapy for patients with Ph 1 ALL.8
Preclinical studies have demonstrated the improved efficacy of dasatinib against BCR-ABL bearing leukemic cells in
combination with traditional ALL-specific chemotherapy agents.9 We, therefore, combined dasatinib with the hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) regimen for the treatment of
patients with Ph 1 ALL and previously reported the high efficacy and manageable toxicity of this combination in this setting.10 Important questions that remain are the durability of these responses and whether this regimen can omit the need
for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in patients without an available donor or those who are unable to undergo

transplantation because of advanced age or comorbid
medical conditions. The primary objective of this study
was the clinical efficacy, including the response rate, and
the duration of disease-free survival and overall survival.
The secondary objectives were toxicity and immunophenotypic and molecular response rates. Previously, we
reported on the response rate, minimal residual disease
(MRD) evaluation, and early follow-up of patients in this
study.10,11 Here we report the long-term outcomes of
patients treated with this regimen and discuss the potential ways in which this strategy can be improved further.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria

Newly diagnosed patients older than 18 years with a proven diagnosis of Ph 1 ALL based on the detection of the
cytogenetic abnormality and/or the fusion transcript
product of the translocation (BCR-ABL) were eligible for
participation in the study. Patients who had received 1 or
2 prior courses of chemotherapy (typically before the
detection of the Ph abnormality) were also eligible for
enrollment but were evaluable only for toxicity and outcome assessment. Patients had to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less as
well as adequate renal, hepatic, and cardiac function with
a serum creatinine level  3.0 mg/dL, a serum bilirubin
level  3.0 mg/dL (unless considered due to the leukemia), and no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure.
Patients were excluded if they had active infections that
were not controlled with antibiotics or if they were pregnant, had a significant history of bleeding disorders, or
had a clinically significant pleural or pericardial effusion
(unless it was directly related to the leukemia). All patients
had to sign an informed consent form approved by the
institutional review board of The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center, and the study was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Treatment Regimen

Initially, patients received oral dasatinib at 50 mg twice
daily for the first 14 days of each of 8 cycles of alternating
hyper-CVAD and high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate
(induction/consolidation cycles). After the demonstration
of their equivalence, the study was amended to replace the
twice daily dosing regimen with dasatinib at 100 mg
daily.12 After the enrollment of the first 42 patients, the
protocol was further amended to 100 mg of dasatinib
daily in the first 14 days of the first cycle followed by
70 mg daily continuously from the second cycle. Patients
achieving complete remission (CR) continued to receive

maintenance dasatinib (initially 50 mg orally twice daily
and, after amendment, 100 mg daily) as well as vincristine
and prednisone monthly for 2 years; this was followed by
dasatinib indefinitely. Patients could receive intensification courses of hyper-CVAD during months 6 and 13 of
maintenance according to their clinical status and the
presence of MRD. All patients received prophylactic intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy to prevent central nervous
system (CNS) relapse. Initially, the number of doses of IT
chemotherapy was determined with a previously reported
risk score, including the presentation lactate dehydrogenase value and the bone marrow proliferative index (6 for
patients with a low risk of CNS relapse and 8 for those
with a high risk).13 Later, all patients received 8 IT chemotherapy treatments administered twice per course.
Patients presenting with CNS disease received twice
weekly IT chemotherapy until the cerebrospinal fluid
became clear of blasts; they then received once weekly CNS
therapy for 4 more doses. Patients with cranial nerve palsies
received radiation therapy to the base of the skull. Full
details of the regimen and the doses of individual agents
have been previously published.5,14 Patients eligible for allogeneic SCT proceeded to it during their first complete
remission (CR1). All patients received standard supportive
measures based on the prevailing institutional guidelines,
including transfusions of blood products, prophylactic and
therapeutic use of antibiotics, and measures to prevent and
treat tumor lysis syndrome, as previously reported.10
Response Criteria

Standard, published criteria for determining responses
were used to assess the efficacy of the regimen.15 The
achievement of CR required a bone marrow examination
showing trilineage hematopoiesis with <5% blasts and
with the absence of circulating blasts and extramedullary
disease. Furthermore, an absolute neutrophil
count > 1.0 3 109/L and platelet counts > 100 3 109/L
were required. Remission of CNS disease was defined as
the presence of no lymphoblasts in the cerebrospinal fluid,
regardless of the white blood cell count. Relapse was
defined as the reappearance of lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow (>5%) or in any extramedullary site. Cytogenetic and molecular responses were
defined as previously reported.11
Follow-Up Assessments

Baseline evaluations included a full history and physical
examination as well as a complete blood count, full chemistry panel, bone marrow aspirate examination for morphology, flow cytometry, and detection of the Ph

abnormality with standard cytogenetics, fluorescence in
situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcription–
polymerase chain reaction for the BCR-ABL fusion transcripts. The complete blood count and the chemistry
panel were repeated at least weekly during the intensive
chemotherapy cycles and at least monthly during the
maintenance phase. The bone marrow examination,
including cytogenetics, and the quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction test for BCR-ABL were
repeated on days 14 and 21 of the first cycle, every 2 to 3
cycles during the intensive phase, and approximately every
3 months during the maintenance phase. The baseline cerebrospinal fluid evaluation was conducted on day 2 of the
induction course and at any other time when IT chemotherapy was administered. An MRD assessment was performed
for all bone marrow specimens as previously reported.10,11
Statistical Analysis and Survival Definitions

Overall survival was measured from the time of study
enrollment to the time of death or last follow-up. Eventfree survival was from the study entry to the time of
relapse, progression, or death. Disease-free survival was
calculated from the time of achievement of CR until
relapse or death from any cause. Survival outcomes were
evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared with the log-rank test. Differences between cohorts
were evaluated with the chi-square test for nominal variables and with the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher’s
exact test for continuous values.
RESULTS
Patients

Between September 2006 and March 2012, 72 patients,
including 63 patients with untreated Ph 1 ALL and 9
patients with 1 or 2 prior cycles of chemotherapy (before
the Ph1/BCR-ABL 1 status was known), were enrolled
and treated in the study. The median age of the patients
was 55 years (range, 21-80 years), with 46 patients being
older than 50 years. The median white blood cell count at
diagnosis was 12 3 109/L (range, 0.4-658.1 3 109/L).
Ten patients had CNS involvement at presentation.
Other pretreatment characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1.
Response and Survival

Patients received a median of 6 cycles (range, 1-8
cycles) of induction/consolidation. Fifty-three patients
received fewer than the intended 8 cycles of induction/
consolidation because of poor tolerance (particularly
older patients; n 5 31), early death (n 5 9) early relapse

(n 5 1), or allogeneic SCT (n 5 12). All patients were
evaluable for an assessment of response to induction;
69 (96%) achieved CR after the first cycle of protocol
therapy or were in CR at the start (5 of the 9 patients
with prior therapy before enrollment). Three patients
died from infection-related complications before their
response to induction could be assessed. After 1 cycle
of therapy, 57 of 69 evaluable patients (83%) achieved
cytogenetic CR; 5 had a major cytogenetic response (4
had 5% remaining Ph 1 metaphases, and 1 had 15%
remaining Ph 1 metaphases), 2 had insufficient metaphases for cytogenetic assessment, and 5 were unknown
(no cytogenetic examination for day 21 marrow). To
date, 45 patients (65%) achieved complete molecular
remission, and another 19 (28%) achieved a major (but
not complete) molecular response at a median of 4
weeks after the initiation of treatment (range, 2-38
weeks). The MRD assessment by flow cytometry was
negative for 65 patients (94%) at a median of 3 weeks
(range, 2-37 weeks).
With a median follow-up of 67 months for the surviving patients (range, 33-97 months), 33 patients (46%)
were alive, and 30 (43%) remained in CR1. Twelve
patients with a median age of 52.5 years (range, 23-63
years) underwent allogeneic SCT in CR1 with a median
of 5 induction/consolidation courses (range, 2-7 courses)
before transplantation. Among the 60 patients who did
not receive a transplant in CR1, 21 had no referral
(including 13 who were older than 65 years and deemed
unfit, 4 who had an early death, and 4 who declined).
Among the other 39 patients referred for transplantation,

only 10 had a suitable sibling or matched unrelated donor,
and only 1 received a transplant during the second complete remission (CR2). The preparative regimens for the
12 patients who underwent transplantation in CR1
included busulfan plus melphalan in 4 (2 with a sibling
donor and 2 with a matched unrelated donor), clofarabine
plus busulfan in 7 (5 with a sibling donor and 2 with a
matched unrelated donor), and fludarabine plus melphalan in 1 (cord blood donor). Thirty-nine patients died;
these deaths included 3 at induction, 19 after relapse, 7 after SCT performed in CR1, and 10 in CR (6 from infections, 1 from an unrelated cardiac event, 1 from unrelated
cancer, and 2 from unknown causes). The 7 deaths
occurring after transplantation in CR1 were due to pneumonia (viral for 1, bacterial for 1, Aspergillus for 1, and
an unknown pathogen for 1), graft-versus-host disease
(1), myocardial infarction (1), and an unknown cause in
(1). The relatively high transplant-related mortality was
likely related to the relatively advanced age of the cohort.
The median disease-free survival was 31 months (range,
Cancer

0.3-97 months), and the median overall survival was 47
months (range, 0.2-97 months; Fig. 1A,B). The median
event-free survival was 27 months (range, 0.2-97
months; Figure 1C). Figure 2 compares the outcomes of
patients who did undergo SCT and patients who did not
undergo SCT in CR1. According to a comparison of the
outcomes of patients above and below the age of 40 years,
it appears that patients younger than 40 years, but not
those older than 40 years, benefited from SCT in CR1,
although the numbers were very small (P 5 not significant and P 5 .02, respectively; Figure 2B).
An analysis of the outcomes based on the MRD
assessment at CR and at 3 months was limited because of
the small number of patients. During the initial CR, 21
patients remained positive for BCR-ABL fusion transcripts
according to polymerase chain reaction analysis; 4 patients
underwent transplantation in CR1. Overall, 7 patients
relapsed, and 11 died with a 5-year survival rate of 52%;
there was no significant difference between those who
received a transplant and those who did not. At 3 months,

the patient was off any therapy. Thirteen relapsed patients
underwent a mutational analysis, and 7 had ABL mutations
(4 with T315I, 1 with F359V, and 2 with V299L). They
were treated with a variety of regimens, including a singleagent TKI in 2 (9%), a combination of hyper-CVAD and
another TKI in 8 (36%), a single-agent monoclonal antibody in 2 (9%), and other in 2 (9%). The 8 patients with
CNS-only relapse received a combination of IT chemotherapy as well as radiation, systemic chemotherapy, and
alternative TKIs. Overall, 16 patients received a TKI for
salvage, including ponatinib for 4 (1 with T315I, 1 with
V299L, and 2 with no mutation), nilotinib for 2 (1 with
F359V), imatinib for 1 (V299L), and dasatinib for 9
(1 with T315I and 8 with no mutation); 6 patients did not
receive a TKI during salvage. CR2 was achieved by all 8
patients with CNS relapse (8 of 8 or 100%) and by 9 of 14
patients (64%) with systemic relapse; 5 (36%) had no
response or died during salvage. Ten patients underwent
allogeneic SCT during CR2. The outcomes of the 17
patients who achieved CR2 are summarized in Table 3.

Relapse Characteristics and Outcomes

Toxicity

Twenty-two patients relapsed; they included 8 patients
who had CNS-only relapse (Table 2). The median time to
relapse was 17 months (range, 6-72 months), and the
patients had received a median of 8 cycles of induction/
consolidation (range, 2-8) before relapse. The majority of
relapses occurred during maintenance cycles while they
were receiving dasatinib (n 5 16), although 3 occurred
after the use of an alternative TKI (imatinib in 2 patients
and nilotinib in 1 patient), 1 occurred during consolidation, 1 occurred after allogeneic SCT, and 1 occurred while

The median times to neutrophil and platelet recovery were
18 and 22 days, respectively, for cycle 1 and 15 and 20
days, respectively, for subsequent cycles. Grade 3 and 4
adverse events included bleeding (gastrointestinal, genitourinary, soft-tissue, and subdural hematomas), pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, reversible rises in creatinine,
deep vein thromboses, and pulmonary emboli as well as diarrhea, infections, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, and elevated transaminases.

encountered by the enrolled patients. Dasatinib was discontinued in 12 patients, and an alternative TKI was
started: imatinib in 8 patients, bosutinib in 1 patient, nilotinib in 1 patient, and ponatinib in 1 patient. One patient
did not receive further TKI therapy. Toxicities that led to
the discontinuation of dasatinib were pleural effusions in 6
patients, pulmonary artery hypertension in 2 patients, gastrointestinal bleeding in 2 patients, skin cancer in 1 patient,
and subdural bleeding in 1 patient.
DISCUSSION
The introduction of TKIs has been associated with a significant improvement in the outcomes of patients with
Ph 1 ALL.16 Several studies have demonstrated a significant benefit from the addition of imatinib to conventional
chemotherapy in both pediatric and adult patients.6,17,18
The introduction of second- and third-generation TKIs
able to overcome resistance to imatinib and to induce
responses in patients for whom imatinib-based therapy
Cancer

December 1, 2015

has failed raises the possibility of improving the outcomes
of these patients even further.4,19 Preclinical data suggest
that combining TKIs with chemotherapy is likely to be
beneficial and prevent the development of mutations responsible for resistance.9 This has been further corroborated by early data from trials in which TKIs were
administered with minimal chemotherapy.8 In the study
by Foa et al,8 all patients received dasatinib in addition to
steroids and IT chemotherapy, and although the achievement of CR was universal, almost half of patients relapsed
within 2 years. Relapses were more common in patients
with limited postremission therapy. Mutations in the ABL
kinase domain occurred in 13 of 17 relapsed patients who
underwent the analysis, and they included T315I in 12.8
In this report, we have demonstrated that durable
remissions and long-term survival can be achieved with
the combination of chemotherapy and dasatinib in
patients with Ph 1 ALL (in many without the use of allogeneic SCT during the first remission). Twelve patients
underwent allogeneic SCT in CR1, and 7 died from
transplant-related complications. Furthermore, 3 patients
died during induction, and 10 later died in CR1, mainly
from infectious causes. This can be partly attributed to the
advanced age of the cohort (median age, 55 years); this
population is less able to tolerate the intensive chemotherapy regimen.
Overall, 22 patients relapsed; they included 8 patients
(11%) with CNS relapse alone. This was comparable to the
incidence of CNS-only relapse among the patients treated
with our prior regimen of hyper-CVAD plus imatinib
(5 of 54 patients or 9%; unpublished data). Seven of these
patients had 6 to 8 IT chemotherapy prophylaxis treatments
(4 had 8, and 3 had 6), and the eighth patient presented
with CNS disease and had a total of 12 IT treatments. Only
1 underwent non–total body irradiation (TBI)-based allogeneic SCT in CR1. This relatively high incidence of CNSonly relapse suggests that the number of prophylactic IT
treatments may not be sufficient and may be a function of
more patients living longer and, therefore, being at a higher
risk of CNS relapse. We have instituted this practice in our
current regimens for Ph 1 ALL patients and have increased
the number of IT treatments to 12. It is also important to
note that all of the patients with CNS-only relapse and 9 of
the 14 patients (64%) with systemic relapse were able to
achieve CR2, and 10 underwent allogeneic SCT in CR2.
There are several potential ways that the outcomes
can be improved further with this regimen. Clearly, the
intensity of chemotherapy can be tailored to the patient’s
tolerability and age. This is likely to be more achievable
with the introduction of more potent TKIs: the reliance
4163

Original Article

on cytotoxic agents can be mitigated with a more powerful BCR-ABL inhibitor such as ponatinib able to suppress mutant clones such as T315I.20 The potential
cardiovascular toxicity of ponatinib should be weighed
against its potential benefit in this setting. Another
potential strategy is to tailor therapy on the basis of the
eradication or persistence of markers of MRD, including
multiparameter flow cytometry as well as quantitative
reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction for BCRABL transcripts and for patient-specific immunoglobulin
heavy chain gene rearrangements.11,21 We have previously reported that the persistence of MRD beyond 3
months of therapy with hyper-CVAD plus TKI-based
regimens can be associated with a lower likelihood of
long-term success.11 Younger patients with an available
matched donor should still be considered for allogeneic
SCT in CR1, particularly if they have persistent MRD.
However, posttransplant strategies, including resumption
of TKI treatment, should be studied further.22,23
