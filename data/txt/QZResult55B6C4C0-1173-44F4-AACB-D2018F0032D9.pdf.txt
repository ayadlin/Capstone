ABSTRACT
The molecular interactions between B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (pre-B ALL) cells and stromal cells in the bone marrow that provide
microenvironmentally-mediated protection against therapeutic drugs are not
well-defined. Galectin-3 (Lgals3) is a multifunctional galactose-binding lectin with
reported location in the nucleus, cytoplasm and extracellular space in different
cell types. We previously reported that ALL cells co-cultured with stroma contain
high levels of Galectin-3. We here establish that, in contrast to more mature
B-lineage cancers, Galectin-3 detected in and on the ALL cells originates from
stromal cells, which express it on their surface, secrete it as soluble protein and
also in exosomes. Soluble and stromal-bound Galectin-3 is internalized by ALL cells,
transported to the nucleus and stimulates transcription of endogenous LGALS3
mRNA. When human and mouse ALL cells develop tolerance to different drugs while
in contact with protective stromal cells, Galectin-3 protein levels are consistently
increased. This correlates with induction of Galectin-3 transcription in the ALL
cells. Thus Galectin-3 sourced from stroma becomes supplemented by endogenous
Galectin-3 production in the pre-B ALL cells that are under continuous stress from
drug treatment. Our data suggest that stromal Galectin-3 may protect ALL cells
through auto-induction of Galectin-3 mRNA and tonic NFκB pathway activation.
Since endogenously synthesized Galectin-3 protects pre-B ALL cells against
drug treatment, we identify Galectin-3 as one possible target to counteract the
protective effects of stroma.

C-terminal carbohydrate binding domain [1]. Galectin-3
is found extracellularly but is also present in the
cytoplasm, and in the nucleus. Its carbohydrate-binding
ability appears to be critical for extracellular functions,
whereas intracellular Galectin-3 has many effects and
molecular interactions that are largely carbohydrateindependent [2]. Importantly, elevated Galectin-3

INTRODUCTION
Galectins are lectins that specialize in the
recognition of galactose-containing structures. Galectin-3
(Lgals3) is a 30 kDa lectin that has cross-linking and
lattice-promoting activity, through combination of an
N-terminal domain that allows oligomerization with a

total = 48000/51000).
Using immunoprecipitation, we also assayed the
growth medium of murine and human stromal cells for
secreted Galectin-3. Figure 1B shows that OP9 and
MEFs secreted high amounts of this lectin, but human
mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC; bottom panel), in
comparison, secreted lower amounts. US7 ALL cells
secreted no Galectin-3, compared to medium + FBS.
However, there was approximately 1.5 fold more
Galectin-3 in the culture supernatants of co-cultures
of OP9 with human US7 ALL cells compared to
OP9 cells alone, indicating that Galectin-3 secretion
is stimulated by the interaction between these two
cell types.
We next compared Galectin-3 protein levels
in pre-B ALL cells harvested from co-cultures with
different stromal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed
that human BLQ1 ALL cells kept in suspension for
24 hours contain very low amounts of Galectin-3, and
that this was significantly elevated when they were
plated on MEF and OP9 stromal cells (Figure  1C).
Similar results were obtained with TXL2 and US7
human ALL cells (not  shown). Although hMSC
did express Galectin-3, there was little Galectin-3
detectable in ALL cells that were plated on them
(Figure 1D).

levels are associated with numerous types of cancer,
and frequently correlate with poor outcome [3–5]. In
addition, inflammatory processes often are associated
with elevated Galectin-3. However, the cellular origin
of, and the reasons for increased Galectin-3 levels are
poorly understood.
We recently showed that B-cell precursor acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) cells derived
from galectin3-/- mice are more sensitive to drug
treatment than wild type cells, and that overexpression
of Galectin-3 by retroviral transduction protects pre-B
ALL cells against drug treatment [6]. Pre-B ALL
can be subdivided into different categories based on
underlying genetic defects such as the presence of the
Bcr/Abl oncoprotein characteristic of Ph-positive ALL.
However all types of pre-B ALL develop by malignant
transformation of B-lineage precursor cells that
normally mature in a regulated fashion under control
of the bone marrow microenvironment by association
with stromal cells. Primary human pre-B ALL cells are
still largely dependent on stroma, and in patients who
have evidence of minimal residual disease after initial
chemotherapy, these cells are localized to the bone
marrow. We found that bone marrow plasma samples
of pre-B ALL patients contain elevated Galectin-3
levels as measured by ELISA [6]. Taken together, these
studies suggest that Galectin-3 in the microenvironment
may promote survival of pre-B ALL cells but did
not establish the cellular origin of Galectin-3. In the
current study, we show that Galectin-3 protein levels
are dynamically regulated and induced through a
reciprocal communication between leukemia cells and
protective stromal cells, and are further increased by
chemotherapeutic drug treatment. Interestingly, both
stromal cells and ALL cells generate exosomes, but
Galectin-3 is only present in microvesicles originating
from stromal cells.

Stromal exosomes but not ALL exosomes contain
Galectin-3
Although the extracellular localization of Galectin-3
is well-established, secretion does not take place through
the classical pathway, as Galectin-3 does not contain a
signal sequence. To our knowledge, the exact mechanism
through which it is exocytosed from stromal cells has not
been described [7] [8]. Interestingly however, Mehul and
Hughes [7] reported that murine macrophages produce
vesicles containing Galectin-3. More recently, proteomic
analysis on exosomes secreted by the bladder cancer cell
line HT1376 showed these contain Galectin-3 [9]. This
led us to consider the possibility that Galectin-3 may be
transported through extracellular vesicles produced by
stromal cells.
Galectin-3 is present in human serum and plasma,
and is used or is under consideration as marker for different
conditions ranging from cancer to acute heart failure [10].
To prevent possible contamination by Galectin-3 from
FBS (see Figure 1B, Gal3 IP from MEMα+FBS), we
used serum-free media to culture stromal OP9 cells, as
well as human TXL2 ALL cells, for exosome isolation.
Extracellular microvesicles secreted over a period of
48 hours into the culture supernatant were isolated, after
a low-speed centrifugation of the supernatant to remove
large cell debris and dead cells.

RESULTS
Stromal cells provide Galectin-3 to
pre-B ALL cells
When co-cultured with stroma, pre-B ALL cells
traffic dynamically between the stromal layer and the
culture medium. Human pre-B ALL cells in direct
contact with stroma contain Galectin-3 detectable by flow
cytometry, but ALL cells harvested from the medium lack
Galectin-3 [6]. To determine whether cellular contact of
ALL cells with stroma induces Galectin-3 in ALL cells,
we first performed flow cytometry to analyze Galectin-3
levels in stromal cells. As shown in Figure 1A, all cells
within OP9 and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)
populations were positive for Galectin-3, with Galectin-3
mainly expressed on the cell surface (Figure 1A; OP9

on these characteristics, we will refer to the microvesicles
as exosomes.
OP9-derived exosomes contained substantial
amounts of Galectin-3 compared to whole cell lysates,
whereas US7 cells, and their exosomes, lacked Galectin-3
(Figure 2A). Similarly, exosomes of TXL2 ALL cells
contained no detectable Galectin-3, and low levels of
a related Galectin, Galectin-1, whereas OP9 stromal
exosomes contained both Galectin-1 and Galectin-3binding protein, Gal3BP (Figure 2B). Selectivity of
incorporation was further confirmed by showing that
exosome lysates of lgals3-/- MEFs contained Galectin-1,
but not Galectin-3 (Figure 2C). The amount of Galectin-3
secreted by way of exosomes in OP9-conditioned medium
was smaller than the total non-cell bound extracellular
Galectin-3 measured in the medium (Figure 2D). We
also compared Galectin-3 levels in exosomes secreted by
OP9 stromal cells over a period of 24 and 48 hours into
the culture supernatant. Both preparations were TSG101
positive and contained Galectin-3 (Figure 2E).

OP9 cells are not malignant and therefore growth
factor-dependent. To assess the effect of growth factor
deprivation due to FBS starvation, we compared apoptosis
using FACS for Annexin V/PI in OP9 kept in serum-free
medium for 24 and 48 hours. At 24 hours, OP9 cells were
Annexin V negative (Suppl. Figure 1A), morphologically
normal and adherent (not shown). At 48 hours, more OP9
cells had become Annexin V/PI-double positive but the
human ALL cells essentially retained full viability even at
48 hours (Suppl. Figure 1B).
OP9 vesicles had an average size of 153 nm as
measured by Nanosight (not shown), which is similar
to sizes reported for murine bone marrow stromal cells,
U87-MG glioblastoma cells, HT1080 lung sarcoma cells
and glioblastoma multiforme (138–170, 196, 148 and
133 nm respectively) [11–13]. The OP9 microvesicles
are also much smaller than the 1000–4000 nm size range
reported for apoptotic bodies of endothelial cells [14].
Lysates from both OP9 and US7 microvesicle
preparations were positive for the typical exosome marker
TSG101 and were negative for calreticulin, an ER marker
expressed on the surface of apoptotic cells and absent
from exosomes [15, 16] (Figure 2A). Detection of the
exosome marker CD63 [17] was decreased (Figure 2B)
after treatment with the neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor
GW4869, which inhibits exosome production [18]. Based

Extracellular Galectin-3 is endocytosed and
transported to the nucleus

US7 or TXL2 ALL cells to them for 2 hours. As
shown in Figure 3A, confocal microscopy established
that stromal exosome content was transferred to
leukemia cells. Conversely, ALL exosomes were able
to attach to OP9 stromal cells and deliver their content
(Figure 3B).
To further investigate exosome-mediated
Galectin-3 transport, we cultured human ALL cells
without OP9 cells for 24 hours to remove stromaproduced Galectin-3 associated with the ALL cells.
Western blotting confirmed loss of Galectin-3 but the
cells retained endogenous Galectin-1 (Figure 3C, lanes
labeled ‘no’ -24). We then exposed the cells to ALL or
OP9 exosomes in the absence of serum. As shown in
Figure 3C, in ALL cells treated with OP9 exosomes,
Galectin-3 levels increased within 2 hours. Interestingly,
Galectin-1 levels also increased in US7 cells. Higher
levels of p100, p52 and p65 NFκB were also measured
in US7 cells exposed for 24 hours to OP9 exosomes,
compared the same cells exposed to US7 exosomes
(Figure 3D). Thus, our experiments present evidence
for a two-way communication exchange of materials
between ALL cells and their stromal support cells via
exosomes.

Exosomes from stromal cells contain proteins and
other macromolecules besides Galectin-3, including
lectins such as Galectin-1 (Figure 2, 3), which also binds
N-acetyl lactosamine-modified glycoproteins [1]. To
identify the specific signal generated in the ALL cells by
stimulation with extracellular Galectin-3, we first removed
the stromal-produced Galectin-3 associated with the ALL
cells. To this end, we cultured TXL2 cells without OP9
cells for 24 hours and confirmed Galectin-3 loss by flow
cytometry (Figure 4A, samples labeled control). We
then stimulated the ALL for 24 hours with recombinant
human GST-Galectin-3 and with recombinant GST as
additional control, in the continued absence of stroma.
The N-terminal GST tag enhances but is not predicted to
change the specificity of the natural lattice-forming ability
of Galectin-3. However, we also included Galectin-3
without the GST tag as comparison. Interestingly,
Galectin-3 was detected on the surface of ALL cells
that had been exposed to either Galectin-3 or GSTGalectin-3, showing that exogenously added Galectin-3
stably binds to structures on the surface of ALL cells

(Figure 4A). High-affinity carbohydrate ligands identified
for Galectin-3 include cell surface proteins containing
tri-and tetra antennary N-linked glycans that are N-acetyl
lactosamine modified. Therefore, inhibition of Galectin-3
binding by competition with lactose, although it is a loweraffinity ligand, can be used to determine if interactions
are partly carbohydrate-lectin dependent. Figure 4B
shows that the binding of GST-Galectin-3 to ALL cells
was reduced by lactose, demonstrating that docking of
Galectin-3 on the ALL cell surface is mediated at least
in part through binding to cell surface glycosylated
molecules.
Many studies support the concept that the function
of Galectin-3 depends on where it is localized. We
therefore treated pre-B ALL cells grown without stroma
with GST-Gal3 for 24 hours in the presence and absence
of lactose and prepared cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions
to determine if the exogenous Galectin-3 was endocytosed

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and transported to the nucleus, or if it was degraded. As
shown in Figure 4C, part of the GST-Gal3 had become
nuclear, and co-incubation with lactose decreased both
cytoplasmic as well as nuclear levels. Lgals3+/+ and
lgals3-/- pre-B ALL cells gave similar results, indicating
that endogenous Galectin-3 is not required for uptake or
nuclear transport of extracellular Galectin-3.
Treatment of T-cells with extracellular Galectin-3
was reported to stimulate apoptosis (reviewed in [19]) so
we asked if extracellular Gal3 treatment of pre-B ALL
cells also induces death in this cell type. In contrast to
the reported effects on T-cells, a 24 hour treatment with
the highest concentration of GST-Gal3 (25 μg/ml) only
marginally increased the percentage of apoptotic cells
compared to controls (Figure 4D).
We next examined if stimulation with soluble Gal3
activates intracellular signal transduction pathways in
pre-B ALL cells. However, stimulation with exogenous

Galectin-3 for 24 hours did not result in increased
activation of Erk1/2, p38 or Akt as compared to a positive
control consisting of US7 cells stimulated by plating on
OP9 stroma (Figure 4E).
We also evaluated NFκB pathway activation.
We found that a 24-hour stimulation of cells with
GST-Galectin-3 but not GST increased cytoplasmic
p100 and nuclear p100/p50, c-Rel and RelA/p65 in
TXL2 cells (Figure 4F). Although alternative NFκB
pathway activation involves proteolytic processing
of p100 to p52 with translocation of p52 to the
nucleus, increased p100 levels and the migration of

p100 to the nucleus have also been reported [20, 21].
We examined the kinetics of NFκB activation in
more detail by comparing cytoplasmic and nuclear
fractions of TXL2 cells stimulated for 1 hour and for
24 hours with GST-Galectin-3. As shown in Figure 4G,
GST-Galectin-3 was recovered both in the nucleus
and cytoplasm at the 1 hour time point, indicating
rapid endocytosis and transport. Increased cytoplasmic
and nuclear p100, and nuclear p65 increases in
GST-Galectin-3 stimulated cells were evident only after
24 hours, consistent with the typical kinetics of NF-κB
activation [22].

Auto-activation of Gal3 transcription

As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, the inclusion of lactose
reduced, but did not eliminate the induction of LGALS3
mRNA in both ALLs. This result is consistent with the
incomplete inhibition by lactose of GST-Galectin-3
cell surface binding (Figure 4B) and internalization
(Figure 4C), and suggests that Galectin-3 may have less
affinity for lactose compared to the natural carbohydrate
ligands on the cell surface. Alternatively, some of the
Galectin-3 binding, internalization and nuclear transport
may be carbohydrate-independent.

These results raise the question if stimulation
of ALL cells with extracellular Galectin-3 modulates
transcription. Since ALL + OP9 co-cultures have higher
Galectin-3 protein levels than OP9 cells alone, we
considered the possibility that Galectin-3 may be able to
stimulate its own transcription. To test this hypothesis,
we removed ALL cells from OP9 stromal support
for 24  hours, then stimulated them with exogenous
Galectin-3. RNA levels of human LGALS3 in the ALL
cells were quantified by real-time RT/PCR using humanspecific primers. As shown in Figure 5, ALL cells in
suspension (control samples) contained very low LGALS3
mRNA levels. Cycle threshold values for control US7
and TXL2 (Figure 5C, D) were 30.3 ± 0.2 and 28.6 ± 0.4,
respectively. However, compared to stimulation with
a molar equivalent of control GST protein, Galectin-3
and GST-Galectin-3 proteins highly stimulated the
transcription of endogenous LGALS3 mRNA in both US7
and TXL2 pre-B ALL cells (Figure 5A, B). To address
to which degree Galectin-3-stimulated transcription
is dependent on binding of Galectin-3 to cell surface
glycoproteins, we also performed this experiment in the
presence of competing, extracellularly added lactose.

Long-term drug treatment increases Galectin-3
in ALL cells in contact with stroma
Increased Galectin-3 protein levels are frequently
associated with inflammation. Since we previously found
that the development of environmentally-mediated drug
resistance (EMDR) in ALL-stromal co-culture models
correlates with a profile of increased expression of
genes typically associated with inflammation [23], we
investigated the effect of chemotherapy on Galectin-3
levels in co-cultures of stromal and leukemia cells. The
irradiation of OP9 cells causes minimal changes in overall
gene expression or Galectin-3 protein levels [24]. Also,
Galectin-3 levels in the medium of irradiated OP9 cells

that had been treated for 6 days with vincristine were
identical to those secreted by control cells not treated with
vincristine (Suppl. Figure 2A), and there were no changes
induced by a 6-day nilotinib treatment in MEFs or OP9
cells (Suppl. Figure 2B, C).
When stromal-dependent mouse 8093 pro/pre-B ALL
cells are co-cultured with MEFs and treated with nilotinib,
the viability of the leukemia cells decreases and their
proliferation is abolished (Figure 6 right panels d0–4).
As reported previously [23], upon prolonged treatment,
and in continued presence of stromal support, such cells
regain the ability to proliferate and developed tolerance
to the drug (Figure 6A, middle and right panels d4–8).
As shown in Figure 6A (left panel), when the ALL cells
were newly plated on MEFs they initially contained low
levels of Galectin-3 protein. After the ALL cells had been
in co-culture with MEFs for 6 days, while simultaneously
undergoing nilotinib treatment, Galectin-3 levels increased
approximately 4-fold in them compared to d0.
Human US7 cells developed tolerance to 2.5 nM
vincristine after 2–3 weeks of continued treatment when
provided with OP9 stromal support, as measured by
increased viability from d12 onwards (Figure 6B mid
panel), although vincristine continued to be cytostatic
as evidenced by the lower cell numbers (Figure 6B right
panel). Galectin-3 protein levels also increased in the ALL
cells during this period (Figure 6B left panel).
To determine if cell contact between stroma and
ALL cells was required for the observed drug-induced
increase in Galectin-3 protein, we measured Galectin-3
protein levels in ALL cells separated from the stromal
cells by a Transwell membrane during drug treatment.
Interestingly, the levels of Galectin-3 did not increase
under these conditions (Figure 6C). To demonstrate that
drug treatment increased Galectin-3 levels above those
induced by the presence of stroma, we performed a sideby side comparison. As shown in Figure 6D, nilotinib
treatment or contact with MEFs increased Galectin-3 in
ALL cells, and treatment with nilotinib in the presence of
stromal support resulted in the highest expression. Similar
results were obtained with human Ph-positive TXL2 cells
treated for 72 hours with nilotinib, in the presence or
absence of OP9 cells (Figure 6E).
To further demonstrate that ALL cells under stromal
cell support can produce endogenous Galectin-3 protein
when stressed by drug therapy, we treated mouse 8093
pre-B ALL cells with nilotinib over a period of 14 days
while in co-culture with lgals3-/- and +/+ MEFs. In nondrug treated cells (samples designated —), Galectin-3
protein was not greatly increased compared to levels
present in the input cells on d0. However, nilotinib
treatment highly induced Galectin-3 on d3 and d12 of drug
treatment, and part of this was produced endogenously in
the ALL cells since it was also measured in cells grown
with Galectin-3 -/- MEFs (Figure 6F).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We previously reported that the emergence of
environmentally mediated drug resistance (EMDR)
correlates with increased levels of pErk1/2 in mouse 8093
ALL cells on d11 of nilotinib treatment [23]. We found
similar results on d12 with 8093 cells co-cultured with
MEFs lacking Galectin-3, although pErk1/2 levels were
lower than in 8093 cells plated on +/+ MEFs (Figure 6F,
compare d12 + samples). We conclude that stromaldependent pre-B ALL cells can be induced to produce
endogenous Galectin-3 protein when they are stressed by
nilotinib or vincristine drug treatment.
To determine if Erk activation is involved in
Galectin-3 induction in ALL cells under drug treatment
we treated ALL cells with the Mek inhibitor trametinib.
Trametinib was able to reduce Erk activation seen in
long-term drug-treated cells on d9 and interestingly,
endogenous ALL Galectin-3 protein levels on d9 were also
suppressed (Figure 6G).

Induction of endogenous Galectin-3 mRNA in
ALL cells stressed by drug treatment
We complemented these experiments by
investigating Lgals3 mRNA levels in drug-treated mouse
and human cells. Lgals3 was highly increased in mouse
ALL cells on d10 of nilotinib treatment, when the culture
resumed proliferation (Figure 7A). LGALS3 mRNA
levels in human US7 ALL cells treated with vincristine
for 24  hours were significantly elevated compared to
vehicle-treated cells (Figure 7B). Higher expression was
also found in these cells on d5 and d12/16 of treatment
(not shown). Human TXL2 in co-culture with OP9 stroma,
treated for 24 hours with nilotinib or with vincristine,
also exhibited significantly elevated mRNA levels
(Figure 7C). Similar results were obtained using different
Ph-positive patient-derived human ALL cells including
US9 treated with vincristine or nilotinib, and UCSF02
ALL cells treated for 24 hours with vincristine or nilotinib
(Figure 7D, 7E). We conclude that induction of LGALS3
is a common characteristic of mouse and human ALL cells
when they are treated with chemotherapy while in direct
contact with stromal cells.

Inhibition of canonical NFκB signaling in pre-B
ALL cells
Since stimulation of pre-B ALL cells with soluble
Galectin-3 activates NFκB, and also induces Galectin-3
transcription, we investigated if canonical NFκB inhibition
would affect Galectin-3 expression. We used BMS345541
[25], an inhibitor which has been reported to affect CLL,
AML and T-ALL [26–28] but with unknown effects on
pre-B ALL.
We exposed TXL2 cells for 24 hours to 10 μM
drug with and without the presence of OP9 cells, and

Since these ALL cells were not in direct contact with
OP9 cells, they contained very low levels of Galectin-3,
consistent with results in Figure 6C. Interestingly, some

nuclear transport or levels. Reduction of total levels of
c-Rel and p65 was detectable within 24 hours of treatment
(Suppl. Figure 3A).
We further measured proliferation and viability
after 72 hours of BMS345541 treatment. BMS345541
was cytostatic at 1 μM for US7 (Figure 8B left panel)
and TXL2 cells (Suppl. Figure 3B left panel) even when
they were grown with stromal support. At 5 μM it also
was cytotoxic, reducing the viability of both ALLs
(Figure 8B and Suppl. Figure 3B right panels) over the
course of 3 days of treatment. In combination with 500 nM
nilotinib (AMN107), BMS345541 further suppressed
the proliferation and viability of TXL2 cells (Suppl.
Figure 3B). BMS345541 also eradicated mouse 8093 ALL
cells co-cultured with stroma at 5 μM concentrations (not
shown).
Assays for drug resistance promoted by stromal
protection require the use of moderate doses of drugs
that do not immediately eradicate the leukemia cells,
and EMDR typically evolves over a period of many
days in co-culture with protective stroma. For example,
treatment with 2.5 nM vincristine as single agent over a
28-day period allowed the detection of drug-tolerant cells
(Suppl. Figure 3C). However, 5 μM BMS345541 killed
the cells within 12 days (Suppl. Figure 3C). Therefore
we selected 2 μM BMS345541 as a lower dose for
longer-term treatment that is still able to reduce nuclear
c-Rel and p65 levels (Suppl. Figure 3D, 3E). As shown
in Figure 8C, monotreatment with 2 μM BMS345541
did not affect viability of the ALL cells and only was
cytostatic during the first 6 days of treatment, showing
that drug-tolerance against this inhibitor also developed
rapidly. Western blot analysis showed that c-Rel and p65
were affected on d3 of treatment, but on d22 levels were
indistinguishable from that of controls (Figure 8D d22
compare lanes ‘c’ and ‘b’). In the d22 cultures treated only
with vincristine or BMS345541, Galectin-3 levels in the
cytoplasm and in the nucleus were elevated compared to
controls (Figure 8D d22 lanes ‘v’ and ‘b’). Interestingly,
in the cultures treated simultaneously with vincristine
and BMS345551, drug tolerant cells did not emerge
(Figure 8C, vincristine + BMS345541 treated samples)
and all cells died.

pre-B ALL patients contain elevated Galectin-3. Here,
we have carefully analyzed the origins of Galectin-3
relevant to this type of leukemia. Surprisingly, B-cell
precursor ALL cells that depend on stromal support for
their growth and survival were found to synthesize little
or no endogenous Galectin-3. This in marked contrast
to a more mature B-lineage cancer, diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, which was reported to contain high levels of
endogenous Galectin-3 mRNA [31]. Similarly, we did not
detect any Galectin-3 in exosomes produced by pre-B
ALL cells. Thus some more mature B-cell cancers differ
from B cell precursor leukemia in that the former make
their own Galectin-3.
Pre-B ALL cells in the bone marrow are in close
proximity to stromal cells and are thought to make
physical contact via structures that, in one study [32], were
named stromal synapses in analogy to the immunological
synapse formed between antigen-presenting B-cells
and T-cells [32]. We found that stromal fibroblasts are
a major source of extracellular Galectin-3. These cells
express a high percentage of the total Galectin-3 on their
surface, and we found soluble and microvesicle-packaged
Galectin-3 in the culture supernatant of stromal OP9 cells.
We can not exclude the possibility that Galectin-3 in the
bone marrow is initially secreted in microvesicles that
release their content over time, as this was reported by
Mehul and Hughes for macrophage-produced vesicles [7].
However we argue that soluble Galectin-3 is biologically
significant, since we found elevated soluble Galectin-3
in the bone marrow plasma of pre-B ALL patients using
an ELISA [6]. Moreover, although ELISA-based assays
for soluble Galectin-3 are widely used for detection in
human peripheral blood serum/plasma, proteomics on
human plasma exosomes [33] report the presence of
Lgals3BP, but not Galectin-3. Thus it is unlikely that
Galectin-3 is an abundant component of human peripheral
blood exosomes. In agreement with this, in exosomes
from serum of control and ALL patient peripheral blood
(TSG101-positive microvesicles with an average size
distribution of 92 ± 2.6 nm and 98 ± 0.4 nm respectively
on Nanosight), Galectin-3 was not readily detectable
(results not shown). Thus it will be more of interest
to investigate if bone marrow of pre-B ALL patients
with minimal residual disease have different levels of
extracellular Galectin-3 compared to those who have no
detectable residual ALL cells.
The question arises how fibroblasts present
Galectin-3 to pre-B ALL cells. We found that close cellcell contact is important for efficient transfer of high
levels of stromal Galectin-3 to ALL cells, since ALL cells
that are not attached to stroma lost significant amounts
of Galectin-3 over a period of hours. This suggests that
Galectin-3 is presented to ALL cells in a concentrated
form through proximity to stromal fibroblasts, bound to
the fibroblast-secreted extracellular matrix, to the surface

DISCUSSION
Subsequent to its identification in 1989 as Mac-2,
a galactose-binding lectin and macrophage marker [29],
Galectin-3 has been implicated in a wide spectrum
of pathological conditions including cancer and
inflammation. Studies on Galectin-3 are complicated by
the finding that it is endogenously synthesized in some
cells, also exported by others, and can be moreover
found present in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm [30]. We
previously reported that bone marrow plasma samples of

of fibroblasts themselves, or concentrated in packages of
exosomes. Exosomes may be a vehicle of choice for some
types of cell-cell communication in which a ‘synapse’ is
formed that allows very precise local delivery of such
vesicles. Indeed, exosome-mediated communication
was recently shown to be an important component of
the immunological synapse between T-cells and antigenpresenting B-cells [34]. Chen et al previously placed
Galectin-3 at the immunological synapse, where it
negatively regulates TCR-mediated T-cell activation, and
identified Alix, which is involved in exosome biogenesis
[35] as a Galectin-3 binding protein [36]. Since exosomes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

only need to transverse a short distance between cells and
are prevented from dissipation because of the confining
boundary of the synapse [34], this is an attractive
model for stromal-produced Galectin-3 uptake by pre-B
ALL cells.
Alternatively, a recent study demonstrated that
exposure of cells to soluble recombinant Galectin-3
triggers the formation of clathrin-independent carriers
(CLICs) in the plasma membrane, promoting endocytosis
of specific cargo proteins such as CD44 and β1 integrin
[37]. Our studies showed that recombinant soluble
Galectin-3 (Figure 4C, 4F, 4G) as well as non-recombinant
11389

(Suppl. Figure 4). We note in this context that in human
patients, massive cell death due to chemotherapy may
generate inflammation in the bone marrow and could
increase levels of extracellular Galectin-3 and protective
intracellular Galectin-3 in pre-B ALL cells though an autoinduction mechanism.
Although inhibitors specific for Galectin-3 have not
yet been reported, our results suggest that Erk pathway
inhibition with trametinib, and canonical NFκB pathway
inhibition with BMS345541, reduce but do not eliminate
drug-induction production of Galectin-3 protein in ALL
cell co-cultures with stroma. Erk inhibitors (manuscript in
preparation) and BMS345541 also reduced pre-B ALL cell
proliferation when the ALL cells were co-cultured with
stroma and this effect could be partly through inhibition
of stromal Galectin-3 uptake by ALL cells and/or its
endogenous production.
BMS345541 cytotoxicity is unlikely to be mediated
only through Galectin-3. A short-term treatment with
varying drug concentrations produced a stochastic effect
on pre-B ALL viability, with cytotoxicity at concentrations
of 5 μM or higher, but with mainly a cytostatic effect at
concentrations of 2 μM when the cells were co-cultured
with stroma. This suggests that this compound may
have off-target effects in which the drug also inhibits
other targets at higher concentrations. However, the
combination of a relatively low BMS345541 dose with
vincristine was able to overcome EMDR, suggesting that
canonical NFκB pathway inhibition, and/or BMS345541
in particular, could be tested in combination with other
drugs for treatment of minimal residual disease of pre-B
ALL in the bone marrow.
Communication between pre-B ALL cells and the
stroma takes place through multiple contacts including,
among others, SDF1α with CXCR4, and α4β1 integrins
with VCAM-1 or fibronectin [48, 49]. Thus Galectin-3
is not the only mode of communication between these
cell types and our results using MEFs lacking Galectin-3
suggest that extracellular Galectin-3 is not absolutely
required for long-term drug tolerance of mouse pre-B
ALL cells (not shown). However, since MEFs also
produce Galectin-1, which is highly related, may have
overlapping functions with Galectin-3, and is moreover
constitutively expressed in ALL cells, the possibility that
lack of extracellular Galectin-3 is compensated for by
the presence of Galectin-1 can not be excluded. Further
studies will be needed to determine to which extent the
functions of these two lectins overlap.

OP9-stromal secreted Galectin-3 (Figure 8A) are
transported to the nucleus. Although the fate of CLICs has
not been tracked, Erbb3 may be transported to the nucleus
of prostate cancer cells through such a mechanism [38]
and we speculate that Galectin-3 and select cargo/client
proteins may make this journey together. Surprisingly, we
recovered Galectin-3 in the nuclear fraction of pre-B ALL
cells within one hour of its addition, suggesting that this is
a mechanism that allows the ALL cells to rapidly respond
to Galectin-3 produced by the microenvironment.
Exposure of some cell types to extracellular Galectin-3
results in programmed cell death. Treatment of CD4 CD8
double-negative T-cells, T-cell leukemia, diffuse large
B cell lymphoma and colon cancer cell lines for 4–48 hours
with 300–15000 nM Galectin-3 was reported to result in
apoptosis of the recipient cells [39–42]. However we found
that treatment of pre-B ALL cells with 25 μg/ml GST-Gal3
or 12.5 μg/ml Gal3 (corresponding to 463 nM Galectin-3)
for 24 hours did not promote apoptosis. We note that serum
Galectin-3 concentrations reported in cancer patients are up
to 32 nM [43–45], in line with our data on Galectin-3 levels
in bone marrow plasma from ALL patients [6]. Although
we can not exclude the possibility that Galectin-3 becomes
concentrated on the surface of cells, resulting in much higher
effective levels than 32 nM, our results do not support the
concept that the Galectin-3 produced by stroma has either
a pro-apoptotic (Figure 4D), or strong anti-apoptotic (not
shown) function. In concordance with this, we were unable
to detect changes in levels of Akt or Erk1/2 activation in
Galectin-3-stimulated cells.
Between 6 and 24 hours after stimulation of the
pre-B ALL cells with Galectin-3, we did detect activation
of NFκB. Also, stimulation of pre-B ALL cells with
extracellular Galectin-3 increased the levels of Galectin-3
mRNA in those cells. Since NFκB transcription factors
contribute to regulation of Galectin-3 expression in other
cell types ([46]; [47] and references therein) Galectin-3
transcription may be directly activated by NFκB.
However, because Galectin-3 protein also migrates to the
nucleus, where it can regulate pre-mRNA splicing [30], it
is possible that regulation of Galectin-3 mRNA levels and
NFκB activation are indirectly linked.
We found a surprisingly strong induction of
endogenous Galectin-3 mRNA and protein expression in
the pre-B ALL cells when they were in contact with the
stromal cells while subjected to the stress of cytotoxic
drug treatment. The de novo induction occurred over
the course of days, correlated with Erk activation and
the emergence of drug tolerance. Cells in suspension
did not induce Galectin-3 protein. Since we previously
showed that increasing levels of endogenous Galectin-3
protein by overexpression from a retroviral vector protects
pre-B ALL cells against drug treatment [6], we propose a
model in which the induction of endogenous Galectin-3
protein production requires cell-to-cell contacts between
stromal and ALL cells and is aided by chemotherapy

Human pre-B ALLs, mouse 8093 Bcr/Abl P190expressing transgenic ALL and mouse gal3-/- and +/+
pre-B ALL cells have been previously described
[49–53]. Galectin-3 null mutant mice on a C57Bl/6J
background (stock  006338) were purchased from The
Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor). Sex and age-matched
C57Bl/6J mice were used as source of WT cells. MEFs
were generated from E14.5 embryos as described
previously [54]. Human leukemia cells and OP9 cells were
co-cultured in MEM-α medium  supplemented with
20%  FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. In all experiments, stromal cells were
mitotically inactivated by irradiation. OP9 stroma
exosomes were purified from non-irradiated OP9 cells.

To measure mRNA levels during drug exposure,
US7, UCSFO2, US9 or TXL2 cells were held in MEM-α
medium with 20% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin for 24 hours without OP9 stroma,
then treated or not with 5 nM vincristine or 1 μM nilotinib
for an additional 24 hours. Parallel samples were kept
on OP9 for 24 hours, and then treated for 24 hours, or
not, with vincristine or nilotinib. To measure the effect
of exogenous Galectin-3 stimulation, human ALL cells
harvested from the medium of co-cultures with OP9 were
kept for 24 hours in medium without OP9 stroma. Cells
were then exposed to medium, or molar equivalent GST,
GST-Galectin-3 or Galectin-3 for an additional 24 hours
or plated on OP9 as positive control. Viability of US7 and
TXL2 cells kept without OP9 for 24 hours was > 90%.

Drugs

Exosomes

The Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib
(AMN107) was obtained from Novartis (Basel,
Switzerland) and was used to treat Ph-positive (Bcr/
Abl–expressing) mouse and human ALLs. Nilotinib was
dissolved in DMSO and stored at −20°C. Vincristine
sulfate obtained as a solution from Hospira Worldwide
Inc. (Lake Forest, IL, USA) was used to treat Ph-negative
ALLs. BMS345541 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St Louis, MO, USA) and Trametinib was obtained from
Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA).

Cells were cultured in MEM-α medium with
20% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
then kept for 48 hours in serum-free medium. Supernatants
were centrifuged 30 minutes at 1500 g to remove debris
and an Amicon 10  k filter was used to concentrate
the medium. Exosomes were isolated using either an
ExoQuick-TC kit (System Biosciences, Mountain View,
CA, USA) or an Exo-spin kit (Cell Guidance Systems LLC,
Carlsbad CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
from OP9, TXL2 and US7 culture supernatants. Quality
of a representative OP9 exosome isolate was determined
by Nanoparticle Tracking analysis using a Nanosight
instrument (Malvern Instruments). Mean particle size
distribution was 153 +/- 3.3 nm with a concentration of
14.11 +/- 1.14 E8 particles/ml. In some experiments, cells
were incubated with DMSO or 20 μM GW4869 (Cayman
Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) for 48 hours. Exosomes
were labeled using an Exo-Glow Exosome labeling
kit (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA,  USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Exo-Green
labeled OP9 exosomes were incubated for 2 hours with
TXL2 cells in serum-free medium. TXL2 cells were
seeded one day earlier at 1 × 106 cells/well of a 24-well
plate. After extensive washing with PBS to remove nonattached exosomes, a 5-minute incubation with CellMask
Deep Red (Life Technologies, Grand Island NY) as plasma
membrane stain was followed by fixing, permeabilization
and DAPI stain.
TXL2 or US7 cells were first cultured without OP9
stromal support for 24 hours, followed by treatment with
50 μg/ml exosomes isolated from OP9, US7 or TXL2
cultures for different time points in serum-free medium
as indicated in Figure 3C. For detection of NFκB pathway
activation, we stimulated 0.2 × 106 24-hr serum-starved
US7 cells without stroma in a 200 μl volume with 100 μg
OP9 exosomes for 24 hours. ALL cells were extensively
washed, then lysed in 40 μl 2xSDS-SB.

Galectin expression
Extracellular and total Galectin-3 levels by flow
cytometry were measured on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, USA). To measure total Galectin-3
using FACS, cells were first fixed and permeabilized
with permeabilization buffer (eBioscience, San Diego,
USA) before staining with PE-Galectin-3 antibodies. To
investigate Galectin-3 secretion, irradiated MEFs, OP9,
OP9 plus 3 × 106 US7 cells or hMSC were plated in a
6-well plate at around 3 × 105 cells/well. After 4 days,
medium (3 ml) was collected and concentrated to around
600 μl by centrifugation through Amicon centrifugal filter
units (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a 10 K molecular
weight cut-off. 250 μl was used for immunoprecipitation
using IgG or Galectin-3 antibodies.
Real-time RT-PCR was performed as described
previously [55] on RNA samples in triplicate. The
following primers were used for mouse galectin-3 (lgals3;
NM_001145953.1): TCAGGTGAGCGGCACAGAGA
(Fw)
and
TCCAGAGCCAGCTAAGGCATCGT
(Rv) to give an 80-bp fragment. Human LGALS3
(NM_002306.3) primers for real time RT/PCR
were: GGCCACTGATTGTGCCTTAT (Fw) and
TCTTTCTTCCCTTCCCCAGT (Rv) to give a 224-bp
