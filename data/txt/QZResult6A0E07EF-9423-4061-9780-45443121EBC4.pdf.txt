ABSTRACT
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major risk factor of chronic liver disease and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Random integration of HBV DNA into the host genome is
frequent in HCC leading to truncation of the HBV DNA, particularly at the C-terminal end
of the HBV X protein (HBx). C-terminally truncated HBx (HBx-ΔC) has been implicated
in playing a pro-oncogenic role in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the mechanism
whereby HBx-ΔC1 contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study,
we investigated the functional role of HBx-ΔC1 in regulating liver cancer stem cell
(CSC) properties. Using Tet-on inducible system, we found that HBx-ΔC1 enhanced
CSC properties including self-renewal, tumorigenicity, chemoresistance, migration and
expression of liver CSC markers, when compared with the full-length HBx counterpart
and vector control. Interestingly, HBx-ΔC1 conferred resistance in HCC cells towards
sorafenib treatment through suppression of apoptotic cascade. In addition, HBx-ΔC1
upregulated a panel of stemness genes, in which Nanog was found to be among the
most significant one in both trasnfected cell lines. Consistently, Nanog was upregulated
in human HCC samples which had HBx-ΔC1 expression. Furthermore, the induction of
CSC properties by HBx-ΔC1 was via the Stat3/Nanog pathway, as administration of
Stat3 inhibitor abolished the HBx-ΔC1-induced self-renewing capacity. In conclusion,
our data suggest that HBx-ΔC1 enhances liver CSCs properties through Stat3/Nanog
cascade, and provide a new insight for the therapeutic intervention for HBV-related HCC.

cell cycle progression, increasing cellular migration,
regulating apoptotic process, inactivating negative growth
regulators and inhibiting nucleotide excision repair of
damaged cellular DNA [3, 4]. Accumulating evidence
shows that random integration of HBV is detected in
80% to 90% of the host genome from HBV-infected HCC
cases, frequently leading to truncation of HBV genome,
especially on the HBx gene locus at the C-terminus [5,
6]. Our previous findings, together with other recent
studies, have demonstrated that C-terminally truncated

worldwide incidence [1]. Chronic infection with hepatitis
B virus (HBV) is one of the dominant etiological factors
of HCC in Asia, accounting to 76% of all HCC cases [2].
HBV X protein (HBx), encoded by HBV X-gene, has been

HBx (a major C-terminal truncated form reported with a
breakpoint at 130aa) (HBx-ΔC1) may contribute to more
aggressive behavior of HCC, which includes enhancing
metastasis and tumorigenicity [7–10]. However, the
molecular mechanism underlying HBx-ΔC1 contributes to
HCC remains largely unknown. This lack of knowledge
presents a hurdle to the identification of novel targeted
therapeutic strategies for this fatal disease.
Recently, increasing evidence has emerged in
support of the existence of cancer stem cell (CSC) /
tumor-initiating cell (T-IC) model in leukemia and a
wide range of solid tumors, including HCC [11]. CSCs
are believed to possess both cancer cell- and stem celllike characteristics, such as tumor initiation, self-renewal,
differentiation and chemoresistance [12]. These cells
are now regarded as the root of the tumor origin and
recurrence. Specifically, in HCC, integrative comparative
genomic analysis has established molecular similarities
between CSCs and normal tissue stem cells, suggesting
a role for liver CSCs in hepatocarcinogenesis [13].
Previously, we and others have demonstrated that CD24+
HCC cells functionally contributed to tumorigenicity and
self-renewal though STAT3/Nanog pathway [14, 15].
Recently, HBx has been implicated to induce stem celllike and CSC-like signatures in HCC [16, 17]. In addition,
HBx has also been shown to enhance the expansion and
tumorigenicity of hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) in HBx
transgenic mice [17], suggesting the importance of HBx
in regulating cancer stemenss. Since HBx truncation is
frequently observed in HBV-associated HCC, it is crucial
to examine the role of truncated HBx in regulating liver
CSCs in HCC.
In the present study, we revealed the functional role
of HBx-ΔC1 in regulating liver CSCs. Our data showed
that HBx-ΔC1 induced CSC properties including selfrenewal, tumorigenicity, and drug resistance through
the Stat3/Nanog cascade. Taken together, the current
findings provide a better understanding on the molecular
mechanism of HCC development associated with
chronic HBV infection, and will significantly improve
our knowledge of HCC pathogenesis with the goal of
developing a more effective management for this deadly
disease.

ranging from Day 5 to Day 27 and Day 6 to Day 9 in
Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 transfectants, respectively
(Supplementary Figure 1). We found a stepwise increase
in expression of stemness-related genes including Nanog
and Sox2 from Empty vector (EV), HBx-FL to HBx-ΔC1
transfectants derived from Bel-7402 from Day 23 onwards
(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 1). Similar effect
on expression of stemness-related genes was observed
in HBx-ΔC1 expressing SMMC-7721 transfectants with
shorter doxycycline incubation time from day 6 onwards.
(Figure 1B). To further verify this finding, we examined
the expression of Nanog and Sox2 in transfectants of EV,
HBx-FL, and HBx-ΔC1 in Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721
by western blot analysis (Figure 1C). However, only
Nanog was found to be markedly increased in HBx-ΔC1
expressing Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721, when compared
with EV and HBX-FL. Based on these data, it suggests the
possible link between HBx-ΔC1 and Nanog.

HBx-ΔC1 expressing cells were endowed with
enhanced tumorigenicity, self-renewal, and
expression of CSC markers
CSCs are believed to possess the stem/progenitor
properties of expression of CSC markers [18], selfrenewal [19], and tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice
[20]. Based on the results observed in Figure 1B and 1C,
all functional CSC assays were performed based from Day
23 and Day 6 onwards upon doxycycline administration
in Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells, respectively. First,
we found that overexpression of HBx-ΔC1 increased
the expression of liver CSC markers including CD133
and CD47 when compared with control and HBx-FL
expression in Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 (Figure 2A).
Accompanied with these changes, we found that HBxΔC1 transfectants exhibited increased self-renewal ability,
as evidenced by the increase in the number and size of
the spheres and their passages in sphere formation assay
(Figure 2B). Next, we examined whether C-terminal
truncated form of HBx was more tumorigenic than fulllength HBx in vivo by tumor forming assay with HBxFL expressing and HBx-ΔC1 expressing Bel-7402 and
SMMC-7221 cells. Cells at density of 5000, 10000 and
50000 were inoculated subcutaneously into NOD/SCID
mice. An increase in tumor incidence and size was
observed in HBx-ΔC1 expressing cells when compared
with control and HBx-FL expressing cells (Figure 2C).

RESULTS
HBx-ΔC1 expressing cells increased the
expression of stemness-related genes

HBx-ΔC1 conferred chemoresistance and
migratory properties to HCC cells

Using lentiviral based Tet-On overexpression
approach, we have successfully established inducible
expression of HBx-FL and HBx-ΔC1 [8] in Bel-7402 and
SMMC-7721 cells upon the addition of doxycycline at
1 μg/ml (Figure 1A). To determine the optimal time of
gene induction, we examined the effect of HBx-FL and
HBx-ΔC1 on the induction of stemness-related genes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our previous studies have demonstrated that liver
CSCs are more chemoresistant to chemotherapeutic drugs
[21, 22]. Thus, we assessed whether HBx-ΔC1 conferred
chemoresistance to HCC cells. For this purpose, we
treated the transfectants of EV, HBx-FL and HBx-ΔC1

derived from Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 with cisplatin
and doxorubicin and subjected them to Annexin V
staining assay. HBx-ΔC1 transfectants was found to be
more chemoresistant to cisplatin and doxorubicin when
compared with EV and HBx-FL transfectants in both Bel7402 and SMMC-7721 cells (Figure 3A). In our previous
study, we found that HBx-ΔC1 was significantly correlated
with more aggressive phenotype of HCC patients [8].
Consistent with that clinical observation, we found that
overexpression of HBx-ΔC1 conferred greater migratory

ability to HCC cells, when compared with control and
HBx-FL overexpression (Figure 3B).

HBx-ΔC1 preferentially conferred resistance
to sorafenib through suppression of
apoptotic pathway
Previously, we found that liver CSCs were enriched
upon sorafenib treatment, as evidenced by an increase
in the abilities in self-renewal and tumorigenicity in

Figure 1: HBx-ΔC1 expressing cells increased expression of stemness-related genes. A. Direct protein lysates of control

and HBx expressing Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells were collected after adding doxycycline for 23 and 6 days respectively and
confirmed that HBx-FL and HBx-ΔC1 proteins were successfully expressed in respective transfected Bel-7402 and SMMC cells, by
indirect immunoblotting using c-myc antibodies to detect myc-tagged-Hbx-FL and HBx-ΔC1 protein. B. qPCR analysis revealed HBx-ΔC1
expressing Bel-7402 had increased expression of stemness-related genes including of Nanog and Sox2 after adding doxycyclines for 23
days when compared with control (EV) and HBx-FL expressing Bel-7402. After adding doxycycline for 6 days, HBx-ΔC1 expressing
SMMC-7721 cells had increased mRNA expression of Nanog and Sox2 when compared with EV and HBx-FL expressing SMMC-7721.
C. Western blot analysis showed that Nanog was found to be preferentially expressed in transfectants of HBx-ΔC1, when compared with
those with EV and HBx-FL.

HBx-ΔC1 driven tumor initiation and selfrenewal through Stat3/Nanog signaling

sorafenib-resistant cells [22]. Since HBx-ΔC1 upregulated
the traits of liver CSCs as shown in Figures 2 and 3,
we hypothesized that HBx-ΔC1 conferred resistance
to sorafenib treatment. For this purpose, we compared
the sensitivity towards sorafenib among HBx-FL and
HBx-ΔC1 transfectants of Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721
and their controls. By Annexin V staining, HBx-ΔC1
transfectants was found to be more resistant to sorafenib
when compared with EV and HBx-FL transfectants in both
Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells (Figure 4A). To further
understand the underlying molecular mechanism for
sorafenib resistance conferred by HBx-ΔC1, we examined
the expression of apoptosis cascade proteins including
Bax, Bcl2, and cleaved forms of PARP, caspase-3 and 9
in the transfectants of EV, HBx-FL and HBx-ΔC1 derived
from Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 in response to sorafenib
treatment. As shown in Figure 4B, HBx-ΔC1 transfectants
demonstrated decreased Bax/Bcl2 ratio and expression of
cleaved forms of PARP, capcase-3 and -9, when compared
with EV and HBx-FL transfectants in both Bel-7402 and
SMMC-7721 cells.

Previously, we found that Stat3/Nanog pathway was
activated in liver CSCs contributing to tumorigenicity
and stemness [15]. In addition, Stat3 signaling activity
has been shown to be enhanced in HBx expressing cells
and HBx transgenic mice leading to carcinogenesis [17].
Therefore, we investigated if Stat3-mediated Nanog
regulation was involved in the enhancement of cancer
stemness by truncated HBx. By western blotting, we found
that HBx-ΔC1 preferentially induced the expression of
Stat3 (Y705) and stem cell transcriptional factor, Nanog,
in Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 (Figure 5A). We also
determined the Stat3 activity by quantifying the phosphoStat3 (p-Stat3 [Y705]) level using immunofluorescence
staining. Consistently, HBx-ΔC1 stimulated Stat-3
activity as indicated by higher percentage of p-Stat3
(Y705) staining when compared with control and HBx-FL
(Figure 5B). We also examined the expression of a panel
of stemness genes in the HCC clinical samples by qPCR

Figure 2: HBx-ΔC1 expressing cells possessed enhanced CSC properties. A. Flow cytometry analysis revealed increased

expression of CSC markers including CD47 and CD133 in HBx-ΔC1 clones when compared with control (EV) and HBx-FL clones in
both Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, Student’s t test). B. Spheroid formation after 8-10 days (10X objective) showed that
both HBx-ΔC1 expressing Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells had increased number and size of hepatospheres formed when compared with
respective control (EV) and HBx-FL expressing cells (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, Student’s t test). P1 and P2 = passage 1 and 2,
respectively C. Control, HBx-FL- or HBx-ΔC1 expressing Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells were injected subcutaneously at 4 sites (2 in the
right flank and 2 in the left flank) per NOD/SCID mouse in three different cell numbers (5000, 10000, 50000 cells). HBx-ΔC1 expressing
cells exhibited increased tumor-forming incidence and size when compared with EV and HBx-FL expressing cells. For SMMC-7721, no
tumor was formed in all three clones when 5000 cells were injected (data not shown).

when compared to respective EV and HBx-FL, (Cisplatin: Bel-7402: 47.5% vs 82.1% and 62.5%; SMMC-7721: 33.5% vs 40.9% and

(Supplementary Figure 2). Consistently, Nanog expression
was found to be up-regulated in the tumor samples with
detectable expression of HBx-ΔC1 when compared to
those with full-length HBx or without HBV infection
(Figure 5C). To further examine whether the HBx-induced
upregulation of Nanog was Stat3-dependent, we examined
the p-Stat3 (Y705) and Nanog expression in the presence
of a Stat3 inhibitor (S3I-201) in Bel-7402 and SMMC7721 cells. By western blot analysis, Nanog expression
was found to be downregulated upon S3I-201 treatment

(Figure 6A). Furthermore, addition of S3I-201 abolished
the HBx-induced self-renewal as indicated by sphere
forming assay (Figure 6B). Taken together, these findings
suggest that HBx-ΔC1 enhances liver CSCs properties
through Stat3-mediated Nanog upregulation.

DISCUSSION
HBV DNA is often integrated and highly rearranged
within the host DNA in HCC [23]. Among the four

proteins translated by HBV, the X-gene product (HBx),
active in transactivation assay [24], has been closely
associated with the HCC carcinogenesis. In the present
study, we demonstrated that the expression of HBx-ΔC1
contributed to cancer stemness and tumorigenicity of
HCC, providing novel evidence for the role of HBx-ΔC1
in HBV-infected liver cancer.
Recently, hepatitis B virus-infected hepatocytes
induced a CSC-like gene signature with EpCAM
upregulation [25]. In addition, HBx enhanced expression
of stemness and CSC markers including Oct4, Nanog,
Klf-4, and EpCAM in vitro and enhanced the expansion
and tumorigenicity of hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs)
in HBx transgenic mice [16, 17]. Consistent with the
previous findings, we found that HBx enhanced the
expression of stemness genes including Nanog and Sox2.
Since COOH-truncated form of HBx has been shown
to have more aggressive behavior in the development
of HCC [7–10], in this study, in addition to full-length

HBx, we also studied the role of COOH-truncated
HBx, with a breakpoint at 130aa (HBx-ΔC1) [5, 6, 8,
26] in the regulation of cancer stemness. Interestingly,
we demonstrated that HBx-ΔC1 enhanced the liver
CSC properties including increased expression of
stemness genes, self-renewal capacity, resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs and tumorigenesis, all these
effects being more prominent than the full-length HBx.
These results have demonstrated the distinct role of HBxΔC1 in promoting liver CSC properties.
Sorafenib is the only FDA-approved molecularly
targeted drug shown to improve the survival of
unresectable HCC. However, the survival benefit of
the sorafenib treatment arm was on average only 2-3
months longer [27], partly due to drug resistance.
In order to understand the molecular mechanism of
sorafenib resistance, we previously established sorafenibresistant HCC cells which were found to exhibit liver
CSC properties including enhanced self-renewal

Figure 5: HBx-ΔC1 regulated liver CSC properties through Stat3-Nanog signaling. A. Western blot analysis revealed
that HBx-ΔC1 expressing Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells had increased Stat3 phosphorylation (Y705) and expression of Nanog, when
compared to respective EV and HBx-FL expressing cells. B. Increased fluorescent nuclear staining of p-Stat3 (Y705) was observed in HBxΔC1 cells in both Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721when compared with respective EV and HBx-FL, as analyzed by immunefluorescence (IF)
staining (40X objective). Stained cells were classified into 4 groups as per the fluorescent intensity measured by Photoshop CS5. C. qPCR
analysis demonstrated that the expression of Nanog was up-regulated in HCC samples detected with HBx-ΔC1 (n=48) when compared with
those with HBx-negative and HBx-FL (n=59) (*p=0.03, t test).

capacity and tumorigenicity, when compared with their
mock counterparts [22]. Since HBx-ΔC1 was found to
upregulate liver CSC properties, we examined whether
it conferred resistance to sorafenib treatment though
enhancement of liver CSC properties. We found that
HBx-ΔC1 suppressed the apoptotic cascade and thereby
decreased the sensitivity of HCC cells towards sorafenib
treatment. In this regard, HBx-ΔC1 may be a potential
predictor for sorafenib response.
Stat3 activation has been found to be important
in the maintenance of survival of liver CSCs (14). We
and others have previously demonstrated that Nanog is
the direct downstream effector of Stat3 in the regulation
of tumorigenicity and self-renewal of liver CSCs and
glioblastoma stem cells [15, 28]. Nanog is a self-renewal
gene that maintains the pluripotency of embryonic stem
cells [29]. Recently, it has been identified as a novel
oncogene by a large-scale oncogenomics analysis
[30], and it is also crucial in regulating human tumor
development [31]. In addition, Stat3 signaling activity
has been demonstrated to be enhanced in HBx expressing
cells and HBx transgenic mice leading to carcinogenesis
[17, 32]. Consistently, we found the upregulation of
nuclear Stat3, p-Stat3 and Nanog expression in HBxexpression cells (Figure 4A and 4B). We found the Stat3/

Nanog signaling pathway was preferentially activated
in HBx-ΔC1 trasnfectants, which was indicated by the
enhanced activity of Stat3 and expression of Nanog
observed in HBx-ΔC1 expressing Bel-7402 and SMMC7221 cells, when compared with HBx-FL and control
cells. Furthermore, the role of HBx-ΔC1-induced selfrenewal was confirmed by the treatment with Stat3
inhibitor. We found that the inhibition of Stat3 activation
using a Stat3 specific inhibitor abrogated the effect of the
HBx-ΔC1-induced self-renewal capacity. These findings
suggest that Stat3-Nanog signaling plays a crucial
role in regulating the stemness properties mediated by
HBx-ΔC1.
In summary, the present findings demonstrated
that HBx-ΔC1 plays a critical role in HCC development
and progression via the regulation of cancer stemness,
which involves the preferential activation of the Stat3Nanog pathway. A better understanding of the molecular
mechanism of HBx-ΔC1 will improve our knowledge of
HCC pathogenesis with the goal of developing a more
effective management for this deadly disease. Our data
also give a new insight on developing targeted therapies
against HBx-ΔC1-induced Nanog and the identification
of novel markers to predict disease outcome and tumor
recurrence.

led to abolishment of HBx-ΔC1-induced self-renewal indicated by sphere forming assay where the number and size of sphere formed (4X
objective) were significantly reduced in HBx-ΔC1 expressing Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, Student’s t test).
