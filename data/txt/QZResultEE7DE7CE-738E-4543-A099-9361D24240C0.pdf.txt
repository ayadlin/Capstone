Abstract
Dietary genistein has been linked to lower prostate cancer
(PCa) mortality. Metastasis is the ultimate cause of death
from PCa. Cell detachment and invasion represent early steps
in the metastatic cascade. We had shown that genistein
inhibits PCa cell detachment and cell invasion in vitro.
Genistein-mediated inhibition of activation of focal adhesion
kinase (FAK) and of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)–heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) pathway has been
shown by us to regulate PCa cell detachment and invasion
effects, respectively. To evaluate the antimetastatic potential
of genistein, we developed an animal model suited to evaluating antimetastatic drug efficacy. Orthotopically implanted
human PC3-M PCa cells formed lung micrometastasis by
4 weeks in >80% of inbred athymic mice. Feeding mice dietary
genistein before implantation led to blood concentrations
similar to those measured in genistein-consuming men.
Genistein decreased metastases by 96%, induced nuclear
morphometric changes in PC3-M cells indicative of increased
adhesion (i.e., decreased detachment) but did not alter tumor
growth. Genistein increased tumor levels of FAK, p38 MAPK,
and HSP27 ‘‘promotility’’ proteins. However, the ratio of
phosphorylated to total protein trended downward, indicating a failure to increase relative amounts of activated protein.
This study describes a murine model of human PCa metastasis well suited for testing antimetastatic drugs. It shows for
the first time that dietary concentrations of genistein can
inhibit PCa cell metastasis. Increases in promotility proteins
support the notion of cellular compensatory responses to
antimotility effects induced by therapy. Studies of antimetastatic efficacy in man are warranted and are under way.

Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cause of
cancer-related death in American men (1). Death is caused by the
formation of PCa metastases (2). Therapy that could prevent the
formation of metastases would thus have the potential for high

clinical effect. There is currently no effective means to inhibit PCa
metastasis.
Cell detachment and cell invasion represent initial steps in the
metastatic cascade (3–5). The putative PCa chemopreventive drug
genistein was initially shown by us to inhibit human PCa cell
detachment (6, 7) and then invasion (8, 9). Cell detachment was
inhibited in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent
manner in several human PCa cell lines (6). Focal adhesion kinase
(FAK) mediates cell adhesion-associated signals in many cell types
(10–12) and was shown by us to do so in human PCa (7). FAK is upregulated during PCa progression, particularly in metastatic cells
(13, 14). Genistein was shown by us to inhibit FAK phosphorylation
(i.e., activation) in human PCa cells (15).
Through a series of related investigations, we have identified
several signaling pathways which cooperate to regulate PCa cell
invasion and have shown that genistein inhibits proinvasion
signaling through them (8, 9, 16–20). Our findings suggest
that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) seems to be
particularly important. Specifically, p38 MAPK was necessary for
phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), which in turn
was necessary for matrix metalloproteinase type 2 (matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2) activation, and PCa cell invasion (8, 16).
HSP27 is up regulated during PCa progression, particularly in
metastatic cells (16, 21–23). Genistein inhibits HSP27 phosphorylation, MMP-2 induction, and cell invasion, by blocking phosphorylation (i.e., activation) of p38 MAPK (8, 9). p38 MAPK is also
important because we have shown that it can activate Smad3
through signaling pathway cross-talk (17). We then showed that
Smad3 increased human PCa cell invasion and that genistein could
abrogate its proinvasion action (19, 20). Together, these studies
suggest that genistein inhibits initial steps in the metastatic
cascade of human PCa and indicate that inhibition of activation of
FAK and of the p38 MAPK-HSP27 pathway may be important.
Genistein is found in soy, and soy consumers have blood
concentrations f2 logs higher than nonsoy (i.e., red meat)
consumers (24, 25). Rates of PCa mortality (and thus metastasis)
correlate inversely with blood concentrations of genistein (26–28).
Soy-consuming Southeast Asians have PCa mortality rates
f10-fold lower than nonsoy-consuming Westerners but approach
Western rates after migration. Some studies suggest that the
prevalence of organ confined PCa (i.e., primary PCa) may be similar
(i.e., 2-fold lower or equal) across cultures (27, 29). If genistein were
inhibiting metastasis, one would expect to find the above
observations.
In the current study, dietary genistein is shown to inhibit human
PCa metastasis. Evidence is provided that this is associated with
inhibition of PCa cell detachment in vivo. While FAK, p38 MAPK,
and HSP27 proteins increased in response to treatment, genistein
effectively blocked their activation.

Genistein Inhibits Prostate Cancer Metastasis

Materials and Methods
Preparation of green fluorescent protein–PC3-M cells. The origin
and culture conditions for PC3-M human PCa cells have been described
(13). green fluorescent protein (GFP)–PC3-M cells were engineered by
selecting cells transfected with GFP under G418 growth conditions, as
described (18). For implantation, cells were suspended in 35 AL of RPMI
1640 (Life Technologies). For sham mice, no cells were added.
Animals and diet formulation. Four-week-old inbred male athymic
BALB/C mice from Charles River Laboratories were treated under a
Northwestern University IACUC–approved protocol, housed in a barrier
facility with 12-h light/dark cycles, and given food and water ad libitum.
One week before implantation, mice were fed soy-free Harlan Teklad 2016S
chow, to which 0, 100, or 250 mg genistein (ICN)/kg chow were added.
Orthotopic implantation of PCa cells. The prostate was delivered
through a lower abdomen midline incision, and the dorsal lobes were
exposed. Cells were injected under the capsule of the right lobe through a
30-gauge needle, thus forming a bleb that remained intact after needle
withdrawal. Using blue dye, separate studies confirmed this adequacy of
technique (data not shown). The peritoneum was closed with 4 to 0
polyvinyl, and the skin was stapled.
Gross and histologic examination of organs. All major organs,
including brain and bone ( femur and pelvic), and resulting body cavities
were grossly examined for metastasis. Organs were weighed and fixed in
10% formalin (bone was first decalcified). A portion of tissue samples were
snap frozen. From measures taken in two perpendicular dimensions, tumor
volume was calculated as 0.52  (width)2  (length).
All major organs were examined for microscopic evidence of metastasis.
Step sections of 1 to 3 mm were performed on formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissue, and 5 Am cuts were stained with H&E, as described (30).
Lungs were step sectioned in the sagittal plane in 30-Am cuts, followed by
5-Am cuts for H&E staining. All necropsies and tissue analysis were
performed by a single person (M.L.). H&E confirmation of metastasis was
required to score an organ as positive for metastasis.
Measurement of plasma genistein concentration. From blood
collected via cardiac puncture, as described (31), total plasma genistein
was measured as described, with modifications (32). Briefly, 100 AL of
50,000 ng/mL 4-hydroxybenzophenone in tert-butyl methyl ether were
added to 0.1 mL of plasma extracted with 3 mL of tert-butyl methyl ether,
the resultant organic layer was evaporated to dryness, and samples were
redissolved in 80:20 (v/v) 0.05 mol/L ammonium formate (pH 4.0)/
methanol. Separation was performed on a Waters Alliance high-pressure
liquid chromatography system, using a Nova-Pak C8 3.9  150 mm reversephase analytic column and a Nova-Pak C8 guard column (Waters Corp.).
Using a gradient mobile phase and a Waters 996 diode array UV detector,
total genistein standards were linear over 65 to 10,000 ng/mL, and assayto-assay and day-to-day variability was below 10%. Values below the lower
limit of quantitation (LLQ) were estimated as the mean of 0 and LLQ.
Immunohistochemistry. Tissues were stained for GFP expression, as
previously described, with modifications (33). In the current study, anti-GFP
antibody (clone A11122, Molecular Probes) was diluted 1:50 in 5% goat serum
and signal detected with the EnVision + System (DAKO). Positive (GFPPC3-M cells) and negative (antibody isotype) controls were always included.
Quantitative image analysis. For in vitro studies, PC3-M cells were
stained with rhodamine-phalloidinn and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) to visualize filamentous actin (i.e., the whole cell) and cell nuclei,
respectively, as previously described (15, 18). Cells were imaged on a Zeiss
Axioskop Microscope, and cell and nuclear morphology of actin and DAPI
images, respectively, determined with MetaMorph V6.0 software (Molecular
Devices, Inc.). For each time and genistein concentration treatment
condition, z10 cells or nuclei were evaluated.
In vivo analysis of nuclear morphology was performed as described, with
modifications, on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor and
metastatic lymph node tissue (34). Briefly, the nuclei of 7-Am tissue sections
were stained with Feulgen using an established protocol (35) and then
scanned on an ACIS II Quantitative Image Analysis Workstation (Clarient,
Inc.) using the Tissue Ploidy software protocol. From regions prospectively

www.aacrjournals.org

identified on adjacent H&E-stained sections, images of individual nuclei
extracted by the ACIS system are presented for ‘‘acceptance’’ or ‘‘rejection’’
by the operator. Reasons for rejection include overlapping nuclei or nuclei
from nonepithelial cells. We modified the program algorithm to include
nuclei of varying sizes, thus providing a ‘‘wide’’ filter setting so as to avoid
potential bias by sampling only larger cells. Morphometric variables of
accepted nuclei are determined by preset program algorithms and exported
into MS Excel files for further analysis. For each tissue type (i.e., primary
tumor or lymph node metastasis), within a given diet group (i.e., control or
genistein treated), z500 nuclei were evaluated (using tissue from five
different mice). All tissue was processed and evaluated at the same time, in
a blinded fashion, by a single person (V.A.).
Western blots. Protein isolation from tissue was performed as
described, with modifications (36–38). Briefly, snap frozen tumor tissue
was extracted with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing
protease (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and 1 mmol/L EDTA) and
phosphatase inhibitors (NaVO4, NaF, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails
1 and 2; Sigma). Immunoblotting for phosphorylated and total FAK (7), p38
MAPK (8), and HSP27 (16) were performed as described.
Statistical analysis. When more than one treatment group was
compared, differences were compared by means of one-way ANOVA. The
difference between two groups was compared using a two-sided t test. In
some instances, as indicated, prior experiments have shown us one direction
in which the change would be occurring, and therefore, we used a one-sided
t test. Differences were considered statistically significant for P values of
V0.05. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the
association between tumor weight and metastatic burden. Statistical tests
were performed with the statistical software package (SAS, V9.1).

Results
Growth and metastasis of PCa cells after orthotopic
implantation. The design of all animal experiments is outlined
in Supplementary Fig. S1. The extent and timing of metastatic
spread after orthotopic implantation of GFP-PC3-M cells was first
characterized. In study 1, cohorts of 10 mice in total for each time
point were implanted with 106 cells, and necropsy was performed
after 2, 3, or 4 weeks. The combined findings from two separate
identical experiments, performed at different times, involving a
total of 29 mice (one mouse died shortly after surgery), are
compiled in Supplementary Table S1A. At 2 weeks, microscopic
primary tumors were evident in 100% of mice. Macroscopic
tumors were seen at 3 weeks but did not increase further at
4 weeks (Fig. 1A). Tumor volume ranged from 0.52 to 3.12 cm3.
By 3 weeks, pathologically enlarged periaortic, periadrenal, and
axillary lymph nodes were found in 100%, 40%, and 0% of mice,
respectively. In all instances, the presence of tumor was confirmed
by histologic examination. Microscopic examination of major
organs found metastases in the lung in 70% of mice, whereas no
metastases were detected in any other organs. By 4 weeks,
metastases to periadrenal lymph nodes and lung had increased to
32% and 84%, respectively. No metastases were detected in liver,
bone marrow, kidney, brain, or axillary lymph nodes. Figure 1B
depicts representative histologic findings of cancer cells in
periaortic and periadrenal lymph nodes.
The affect of surgery and tumor growth, upon food intake and
body weight, were evaluated next. In this experiment, five mice
were sham-injected and five mice were implanted with 106 GFPPC3-M cells at the same time. This was repeated at a separate time,
giving 10 mice per cohort. Weekly food consumption was relatively
constant over the 4-week time course and was similar across
cohorts (Supplementary Fig. S2). Both cohorts were gaining weight
at 2 weeks, and this trend continued for sham mice (Fig. 1C). After
2 weeks, the implant cohort lost weight, and by 4 weeks, this was

>10% of presurgery weight. Future experiments did not exceed
4 weeks.
Study 2 examined the effect of cell number on metastatic spread.
Mice, in cohorts of 7, were implanted with 104, 105, or 106 GFP-PC3M cells. Findings from necropsy performed at 4 weeks are in
Supplementary Table S1B. Macroscopic lymph node metastases
and prostate tumors were found in 100% of mice in all groups. The
average weight of prostate tumors was comparable across cohorts.
Lung metastases were detected in 28%, 42%, and 100% of mice
implanted with 104, 105, and 106 cells, respectively. To evaluate
whether increased tumor size led to increased metastases, tumor
volume and number of lung metastases were compared for each
mouse. There was no correlation.
Characterization of lung metastases. A model wherein
metastases can be readily quantified, but do not saturate the
destination organ (in this case, lung), is well suited for evaluating
antimetastatic drugs. Therefore, the current model was further
characterized. Lung metastases were not associated with detect-

able surface nodules in any mouse or with an alteration of lung
weight (Fig. 1D). The abnormally large nuclei characteristic of GFPPC3-M cells were readily visible on H&E-stained tissue, thus
allowing easy detection (Fig. 1D). Detection of GFP by immunohistochemistry definitively identified them as GFP-PC3-M cells
(Fig. 1D). Staining for GFP did not detect additional GFP-PC3-M
cells when compared with histomorphometric-based methods
(data not shown).
As quantitative PCR (qPCR) using GFP-specific primers offered
the potential for easy quantitation of GFP-PC3-M cells within
mouse lung, a series of extensive experiments was performed to
evaluate the potential utility of this approach, Supplementary Fig. 3.
These experiments indicate that use of qPCR does not provide an
accurate means of quantitating metastatic cells to the lung in the
current model. Thus, further quantitation of lung metastasis was
performed histomorphometrically.
Genistein inhibits PCa metastasis. In study 3, the ability of
genistein to inhibit PCa metastasis was evaluated. Mice were

Figure 2. Genistein inhibits human PCa metastasis. Mice were fed chow containing 0 (for controls), 100, or 250 mg genistein/kg chow, implanted 1 wk later with
106 GFP-PC3-M cells, and tissue was harvested after 4 wk. Two separate and identical experiments were performed at separate times, involving a total of 10 mice

treated with 0, 100, or 250 mg genistein/kg chow implanted with
106 cells, and necropsy was performed after 4 weeks. In each of two
separate identical experiments performed at different times, there
were five mice per treatment cohort. Thus, 30 mice in total were
involved for the two experiments combined. In experiment 1, one
mouse in each cohort died postsurgery.
Plasma total genistein concentration was measured in each
mouse (Fig. 2A). For 0, 100, and 250 mg cohorts, the mean F SE
genistein concentration was below the LLQ, 290 F 72 and 1307 F
507 nmol/L, respectively. The mean steady-state plasma concentration of genistein in soy-consuming Japanese men was reported
by Adlercreutz et al. to be 276 nmol/L (25). The mean peak
plasma concentration in an older cohort of American men with
PCa, after prospective oral dosing with f2 dietary amounts of
soy-derived genistein, was shown by us to be 5,100 nmol/L (32).
Thus, the current study attains blood concentrations which
emulate those seen in both epidemiologic and prospective-based
human studies.
In experiment 1, the mean F SE percentage of control lung
metastases was 40 F 11% and 6 F 2% for the 100 and 250 mg
cohorts, respectively, Fig. 2B (ANOVA P = 0.0001). When compared
with control, the decrease was statistically significant (t test P V
0.05) for both the 100-mg and 250-mg cohorts. When compared
with the 100-mg cohort, the additional decrease in the 250-mg

www.aacrjournals.org

cohort was also statistically significant. In contrast to the
pronounced antimetastatic effect of genistein, tumor volume was
not significantly affected by genistein (ANOVA P = 0.66).
In experiment 2 (Fig. 2C), lung metastasis were 47 F 15% and
2 F 2% of control values for the 100-mg and 250-mg cohorts,
respectively (ANOVA P = 0.0064). Compared with control, decreases
in lung metastases were statistically significant for the 250-mg
cohort (t test P V 0.05) but not for the 100-mg cohort. Compared
with the 100-mg cohort, the additional decrease in the 250-mg
cohort was statistically significant. Tumor volume was not
significantly affected by genistein (ANOVA P = 0.47).
Given the identical nature of experiments 1 and 2, we performed
a combined analysis. Treatment with 100 and 250 mg genistein/kg
chow significantly decreased metastases to 44 F 9% and 4 F 1% of
control mice, respectively (ANOVA P < 0.0001; Fig. 2D). The
decrease was statistically significant (t test P V 0.05) for both the
100-mg and 250-mg cohorts when compared with control and for
the 250-mg cohort when compared with the 100-mg cohort.
Genistein had no significant effect upon tumor volume (ANOVA
P = 0.92). Note that all mice in all cohorts had macroscopic lymph
node metastases, and there was no difference in the weight of
lymph nodes between the cohorts (data not shown).
Genistein induces PCa cell flattening in vivo. The above
findings show that genistein inhibits PCa metastasis. Cell

detachment represents an initial step in the metastatic cascade
(3, 5). Genistein inhibits PCa cell detachment in vitro (6, 7). We
therefore investigated whether genistein could inhibit PCa cell
detachment in vivo. Cell morphology reflects the attachment status
of cells. Consequently, changes in cell morphology are used
to measure changes in cell adhesion (39). We have previously
shown that genistein-mediated increases in PCa cell attachment
are associated with cell flattening in vitro, in a time-dependent
and concentration-dependent fashion (6). The morphology of
whole cells residing within intact solid organ tissue cannot be
accurately quantitated. However, changes in cell morphology
induce changes in nuclear morphology, and the latter can readily
be assessed by quantitative image analysis in cells within tissue,
including prostate (40, 41). For genistein, in particular, we have
shown that its induction of cell flattening is associated with nuclear
flattening (6).
As our prior assessment of in vitro morphology was qualitative,
we first quantitated effects of genistein upon morphology in vitro.
PC3-M cells were treated with 1 to 10,000 nmol/L genistein
(0 nmol/L for controls) for 3 or 7 days, and cell and nuclear
morphology were quantitated. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, genistein
increased cell length (ANOVA P = 0.2 and 0.01 for 3 and 7 days,
respectively) and cell area (0.2 and 0.01), as well as nuclear length
(0.0007 and 0.0003) and nuclear area (<0.0001 and <0.0001), in a

time-dependent and concentration-dependent fashion. The effects
of genistein differed from control in a significant (t test P V 0.05)
and consistent manner at lower concentrations after 7 days,
compared with 3 days, for all variables evaluated. In addition, the
magnitude of the change was greater after 7 days compared with
3 days. Importantly, changes in nuclear morphology mirrored those
at the whole-cell level, particularly for the 7-day cohort. From
representative cells treated with 1,000 nmol/L genistein  7 days
(Fig. 3B), it can be seen that the ability of genistein to induce cell
and nuclear flattening are readily apparent visually.
The effects of genistein upon PCa cell nuclear morphometry
in vivo was next evaluated. The morphometric variables which
provide a measure of nuclear flattening are area, compactness,
feret X, and feret Y; compactness = (perimeter)2 / [4p (area)].
Maximum compactness is reflected by a value of 1, and is seen with
a perfect circle. Perturbations of the circular shape, such as those
induced by cell stretching, are reflected by an increase in the value
of the compactness number. Ferets X and Y are derived by
constructing the smallest box around a nucleus that will
completely encompass that nucleus. The length and width of that
box constitute ferets X and Y, respectively.
Metastatic lymph node tissue and primary tumor from the
prostate were evaluated, and GFP-PC3-M cell morphology was
compared between five control mice and five mice treated with

Genistein Inhibits Prostate Cancer Metastasis

Figure 4. Genistein alters human PCa
cell nuclear morphology in vivo. A, nuclear
morphometric analysis was performed on
GFP-PC3-M cells present within primary
tumor and lymph node tissue from five
control mice and five mice treated with
250 mg genistein/kg chow, as described in
Materials and Methods. B, representative
photomicrographs of Feulgen-stained

closed arrows indicate representative
lymphocytes and GFP-PC3-M cells,
respectively.

250 mg genistein/kg chow. The resultant nuclear morphometric
variables are depicted in Fig. 4A. They indicate that genisteininduced nuclear flattening. Specifically, genistein induced statistically significant (t test P V 0.05) changes in the following variables:
(a) increase in feret X in both primary tumor and lymph node, (b)
increase in area and feret Y in lymph node, and (c) decrease in
nuclear compactness (i.e., increase in the value of the nuclear
compactness number) in lymph node. Furthermore, there was a
trend toward an increase in the nuclear compactness number in
primary tumor with genistein (P = 0.13).
Overall, both the magnitude and the statistical significance of
genistein-induced nuclear flattening were greater in lymph node
tissue than in primary tumor. These changes in the lymph node
can be visually appreciated (Fig. 4B). In control tissue, GFP-PC3-M
cell nuclei (solid arrows) tended to be rounded and dense.
However, in genistein-treated tissue, cell nuclei tended to be less
rounded, to exhibit less intense staining with increased granularity,
and to be more spread out. The intensity of staining and
morphology of lymphocytes (open arrows) was similar between
the two tissues, thus providing a control.
Genistein increases expression, but not activation, of
promotility proteins. Through a series of prior in vitro
investigations, we have identified proteins which regulate PCa cell
detachment and invasion and have shown that genistein inhibits
their activation (7–9, 15, 16). Together, these studies implicate
genistein-mediated inhibition of phosphorylation of FAK and of
both p38 MAPK and HSP27 in genistein-mediated inhibition of cell
detachment and invasion, respectively.
To evaluate in vivo effect of genistein upon these proteins, their
level of expression was first measured in prostate tumor–derived
protein by Western blot. By histomorphometry, >95% of tumorassociated cells were GFP-PC3-M. We have previously shown that

www.aacrjournals.org

when measuring phosphorylated proteins, minimization of exposure to high intrinsic levels of prostate acid phosphatase is critical
(17). For current study, experience has shown5 that it is optimal
to split the protein extract from a given mouse: use one half to
exclusively measure total protein and use the other half to
exclusively measure phosphorylated protein. This was done for five
control mice and five mice treated with 250 mg genistein/kg chow.
Interestingly, genistein seemed to increase the expression of
these ‘‘promotility’’ proteins (Fig. 5). Specifically, increases in FAK
by 53% (P = 0.04) and p38 MAPK by 31% (<0.001) were significant,
whereas the 16% increase in HSP27 represented a trend (0.07).
Because genistein inhibits the promotility action of these proteins
by blocking phosphorylation on residues which can be recognized
by phosphorylation-specific antibodies (8, 15, 16), we next
measured the ratio of phosphorylated protein to total protein
(Fig. 5B). Importantly, this ratio was not increased by genistein and,
in fact, seemed to be decreasing. Specifically, decreases in this ratio
by 23% for p38 MAPK (one-sided t test P = 0.03) and by 12% for
HSP27 (0.05) were significant, whereas the 12% decrease observed
for FAK was not significant (P = 0.23). As we had previously shown
that genistein decreased the phosphorylation of these proteins, we
used a one-sided t test.

Discussion
We show for the first time that dietary genistein inhibits PCa
metastasis. If genistein was in fact an active PCa antimotility drug
in man, it would be expected that it should be effective in a variety

of relevant preclinical model systems. In this regard, it is important
to note that antimetastatic efficacy of genistein in mice in the
current study is consistent with our prior cell-based investigations
which show that genistein inhibits initial steps in the metastatic
cascade, namely, cell detachment and cell invasion (6–9).
Epidemiologic findings further support the notion that genistein
may be active in man. A number of studies associate dietary
consumption of genistein with a lower mortality from PCa, and of
particular interest, some suggest that there may be little effect upon
the incidence of organ-confined PCa (26–29). The clinical relevance
of genistein-mediated inhibition of PCa metastasis in the current
study is also supported by the fact that efficacy was observed at
genistein concentrations in the blood observed in man. The blood
concentrations attained in mice in the current study correspond to
those measured in men in epidemiologic dietary studies (25),
as well as those measured by us and others (32, 42) in men with
PCa after prospective dosing. The concentration of genistein is
a critical factor when considering mechanism. This is because
many mechanisms have been linked to genistein, but most require
concentrations >2 logs above those attained in the blood after
dietary intake (43, 44).
It was also shown for the first time that genistein induces
flattening of cell nuclei in vivo, a measure of increased cell
attachment. This represents a second measure of antimetastatic
action, independent from the actual measure of metastases.
However, given that cell detachment is an initial step in the
metastatic cascade, a causal linkage is implicated. The current
in vivo effects represent an extension of prior in vitro work, wherein
genistein-mediated increase in PCa cell adhesion was associated
with cell and nuclear flattening in several human PCa cell lines (6).
Because it is not possible to accurately quantitate prostate cell
morphology in intact tissue, nuclear morphology is routinely

measured (40, 41), as was done in the current study. As our prior
in vitro analysis of cell and nuclear morphology was qualitative, it
was important that we extended those findings in the current study
by quantitatively evaluating effects in vitro. In this manner, we
show that genistein-mediated effects upon nuclear morphology
mirror cellular effects.
Interestingly, both the magnitude and the statistical significance
of genistein-induced nuclear flattening were greater in lymph node
tissue than in primary tumor. Although additional studies are
necessary to elucidate the etiology of this observation, it likely
relates to the fact that cells interact with different extracellular
environments differently (in this case, the lymph node versus the
prostate gland environment), as put forth in the ‘‘seed and soil’’
hypothesis (45). This notion is further supported in the current
study by noting that differences in morphology exist between PCa
cells in the prostate versus those in the lymph node, even within
untreated mice (see Fig. 4A).
It was surprising to find that genistein increased the expression
of ‘‘promotility’’ proteins. In particular, total levels of p38 MAPK
and FAK were significantly increased, whereas the increase in total
HSP27 represented a trend. It was thus important that we showed
that genistein blocked the activation of these proteins in vivo. In
fact, the levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and phosphorylated
HSP27 were significantly decreased by genistein, whereas decrease
of phosphorylated FAK in genistein only represented a trend. This
is the first time genstein has been shown to inhibit activation of
these proteins in vivo. Importantly, the current in vivo findings are
consistent with our prior in vitro studies which show that
genistein inhibits phosphorylation of FAK (15), p38 MAPK (8), and
HSP27 (9), thereby inhibiting PCa cell detachment and invasion.
Given that each of these proteins individually plays a role in
regulating PCa cell motility, but together do so in a cooperative

mice and five mice treated with 250 mg genistein/kg chow, and Western blots were performed for total and phosphorylated FAK, p38 MAPK, and HSP27, as
described in Materials and Methods. B, the density of individual bands was determined. Columns, resultant mean ratio of total protein/GAPDH and phosphorylated

Genistein Inhibits Prostate Cancer Metastasis

fashion, it was of further importance that we evaluated them at
the same time in the same model system. This is because it
allowed us to determine that genistein led to relatively general
increases in promotility proteins while blocking their activation
and blocking cell motility. Together, these findings support the
notion that pharmacologic inhibition of cell motility may cause
the cell to mount a compensatory response. As distinct cell types,
by definition, have homeostatic regulatory processes, this finding
is not surprising. These points should be carefully considered in
the interpretation of molecular biomarkers of efficacy, typically
used in the conduct of human cancer chemoprevention trials (46).
A failure to consider this possibility may wrongly lead one to
conclude that a given chemopreventive agent is inducing an
‘‘undesirable’’ molecular phenotype, when in fact it is actually
inhibiting the process being targeted.
The novel model described in the current study is well suited for
testing the effect of agents upon human PCa metastasis. Its salient
characteristics relate to the facts that lung metastases can be
readily quantified, do not saturate the destination organ, and
develop in the relatively short time frame of 4 weeks. Furthermore,
it is a robust model and uses established cells directly from culture.
Other metastatic models of PCa require serial passage of cell lines
through mice, or implantation of solid tumor fragments, and
involve assay times in excess of 3 months. In addition, it provides
macroscopic primary and metastatic tumor. This allows the
conduct of mechanism-specific studies and the assessment of
growth inhibitory effects.
Genistein has estrogenic activity, and thus, some have implicated
it as a potential anti-PCa mechanism (43). Although estrogenic
activity of genistein is in fact very weak (47), we felt it important to
evaluate potential hormone-based effects and did so in prior
studies. Specifically, PC3-M cells have been shown by us to lack
estrogen receptors, are known to lack androgen receptors, and do
not respond to either hormone (13, 15). We have also shown that
estrogen does not alter genistein efficacy upon PC3-M cells (6, 15).
While the current study neither proves nor refutes an estrogenassociated mechanism for genistein in PCa, given these prior
findings, it is unlikely that estrogen plays a role in mediating
genistein effects in the current system.
The development of lymph node metastases seemed to require
at least 2 weeks but did not otherwise correlate with time nor
with the number of implanted cells. This likely reflects the fact
that some factors cannot be controlled, e.g., the effect of
hydrostatic pressure, induced by the surgical procedure itself
upon lymphatic flow. In support of this notion, others who have
used lymph node metastasis as a primary measure report that
genistein increases metastasis (48). Whereas this finding seems to
be in contrast to ours, it in fact provides another measure of
genistein’s ability to increase PCa cell adhesion. Specifically, PCa
cells suspended in lymphatic fluid would be expected to more
readily attach to regional lymph nodes in the presence of
genistein. In contrast to lymph node metastasis, the development
of lung metastases in the current study was dependent upon both

time and cell number. A number of factors suggest that
hematologic seeding during surgical implantation was not a
driving factor for the development of lung metastases. All
implantations were done under direct visualization to ensure the
formation of a stable subcapsular bleb. Also, uncontrolled
hematologic seeding would be expected to cause wide variations
in metastasis, and the associated loss of cells into the circulation
should correlate with decreased primary tumor volume. These
were not observed. Finally, given that genistein increases PCa cell
adhesion, increased hematologic seeding would be expected to
result in an increase in the number of metastases, at least in a
subset of mice. This too was not observed.
The current model does have inherent limitations. They relate
to the microscopic nature of lung metastasis (a barrier to
molecular analysis) and the rapid growth of primary tumor (limits
the assay time to 4 weeks). Measurement of metastases by use of
qPCR for GFP did not provide a linear quantitation of GFP
containing PC3-M DNA. We have extensive experience in performing qPCR on limiting amounts of tissue in a variety of different
systems and were surprised by this finding (33, 49, 50). It is
possible that further technical refinement can overcome this
limitation. Until that time, quantitation of lung micrometastases
should be performed by histomorphometry. Finally, the current
model only permits investigation of metastasis in lung and lymph
node tissue. In the particular case of genistein, which acts to
inhibit PCa cell detachment from the primary organ, there is no
reason to believe that efficacy would be limited to a single distant
organ, in this case, lung.
Collectively, our findings characterize a robust model of human
PCa metastasis suitable for testing the efficacy of antimetastatic
agents. In this model, dietary genistein was shown to decrease
human PCa metastasis in a dose-dependent manner. Associated
mechanistic studies implicate genistein-mediated inhibition of PCa
cell detachment. They also indicate that cellular compensatory
responses may in fact lead to increases in promotility proteins, but
further suggest that genistein inhibits their activation. These in vivo
findings corroborate in vitro studies, which together support the
notion that genistein-mediated inhibition of PCa metastasis may
be in part responsible for the lower mortality associated with
dietary genistein consumption. A more definitive linkage between a
genistein-mediated antimetastatic mechanism and epidemiologic
findings will require a dedicated analysis of genistein effects upon
human prostate cells in humans. We have completed a phase 1 trial
of genistein in men with PCa (32) and have implemented a phase 2
trial designed to evaluate genistein antimotility effect upon PCa
cells in man.
