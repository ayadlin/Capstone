Deguelin is known to suppress the growth of cancer cells; however, its anti-metastatic effects have
not been studied so far in any cancer model. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antimetastatic potential of deguelin in vivo and in TGFβ1-stimulated cells. Our results demonstrate
that tumor growth, peritoneal-dissemination and liver/lung metastasis of orthotopically implanted
PanC-1-luc cells were significantly reduced in deguelin-treated mice along with the induction of
apoptosis. Furthermore, deguelin-treated tumors showed increased epithelial signature such as
increased expression of E-Cadherin and cytokeratin-18 and decreased expression of Snail. Similar
observations were made when PanC-1, COLO-357 and L3.6pl cells were treated in vitro with
deguelin. Moreover, E-cadherin was transcriptionally up-regulated and accumulated in the
membrane fraction of deguelin-treated cells as indicated by increased interaction of E-Cadherin
with β-catenin. TGFβ1-induced down-regulation of E-Cadherin and up-regulation of Snail were
abrogated by deguelin treatment. In addition, deguelin inhibited TGFβ1-induced Smad3
phosphorylation and Smad4 nuclear translocation in PanC-1 cells. Furthermore, when TGFβ1induced NFkB activation was inhibited, TGFβ1-induced Snail up-regulation or E-Cadherin downregulation was blocked. Deguelin also significantly down regulated the constitutive
phosphorylation and DNA binding of NFkB in a dose dependent manner. Interestingly,
overexpression of either NFkB or Snail completely abrogated deguelin-mediated EMT inhibition,
whereas overexpression of NFkB but not Snail rescued cells from deguelin-induced apoptosis.
Hence, deguelin targets NFkB to induce reversal of EMT and apoptosis but downstream effectors
might be different for both processes. Taken together, our results suggest that deguelin suppresses
both pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting epithelial to
mesenchymal transition.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States of
America (1). Most of the patients with pancreatic cancer develop metastasis and die because
of the debilitating metabolic effects of their unrestrained growth (2). Several well-known
factors such as late detection and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy contribute to poor
survival rate. Pancreatic cancer commonly metastasize to the abdominal cavity, lymph nodes
and liver (3).

Author Manuscript

Emerging evidences suggest that EMT is a key process in tumor cell invasiveness and
metastasis. Previous reports have shown a close association between pancreatic cancer
progression and EMT (4). In fact several pancreatic cancer cell lines and surgically resected
pancreatic tumors have shown strong EMT characteristics (4-6). Interestingly, increase in
fibronectin or vimentin and decrease in E-Cadherin expression in tumors correlates with
poor survival (5). A recent report has shown that 43% (13/30) of primary pancreatic tumors
and 53% (8/15) of metastatic tumors have increased levels of N-Cadherin, indicating the
potential role of EMT in pancreatic cancer metastasis (6).

Tumor growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) can induce and maintain EMT during embryogenesis and
cancer progression (7). It induces EMT by canonical Smad signaling and/or non-canonical
TGFβ/TAK1/IKK/NFkB signaling, but both the pathways merges on Snail to repress ECadherin expression (8). The most important suppressors of E-Cadherin are Snail-related
zinc-finger transcription factors such as Snail, Slug and SIP-1/ZEB (9). Interestingly, Snail
knockout animals die at gastrulation stages and show defects in EMT indicating the role of
Snail in EMT induction (10). Recently, NFkB was identified as a central mediator of EMT
by regulating Snail expression (11, 12). Huber et al. have shown that the activation of NFkB
promoted the transition to a mesenchymal phenotype even in the absence of TGFβ (11).
Moreover, inhibition of NFkB in metastatic cells resulted in reversal of EMT suggesting that
the IKK-2/IkBα/NFkB pathway is required for induction and maintenance of EMT in
epithelial cancer cells (11).

Recognition of EMT as a potential mechanism for metastasis may offer new targets for
therapeutic intervention (13). Such therapeutic intervention might prevent tumor invasion
and block metastasis, if applied at an early phase of tumor growth. If a primary tumor has
already metastasized to distant sites, anti-EMT approach alone may not be sufficient.
Deguelin, a rotenoid isolated from Mundulea sericea Willd. (Leguminosae) has shown to be
a potential anti-cancer agent in various cancer models such as breast, colon and lung cancer
(14-16). Intravenous injection of deguelin showed a mean residence time (MRT) of 6.98 h
and terminal half-life (t1/2) of 9.26 h. About 58 and 14% of the deguelin was eliminated via
feces and urine, respectively, within 5 days of intragastric (i.g) administration of deguelin
(17). Previous reports have shown that deguelin inhibits the survival of various cancer cells

by targeting the key survival pathways such as AKT, Wnt, NFkB and cell cycle proteins
(14-16, 18-20). However, the anti-metastatic potentials of deguelin have not been
investigated in any cancer model. The present study was designed to elucidate the role of
deguelin on EMT and metastasis in pancreatic cancer.

Results
Deguelin inhibits primary tumor growth and spontaneous in vivo metastasis of pancreatic
tumors

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Previous reports have shown that deguelin inhibits the growth of cancer cells (18, 21, 22). In
the present study, we evaluated whether deguelin could inhibit the metastasis of pancreatic
cancer along with primary tumor growth. To determine the anti-metastasis potential of
deguelin in vivo, mice that were orthopically implanted with PanC-1-luc cells were treated
with 5mg/kg deguelin (1:1 corn oil:DMSO, daily, i.p) and tumor growth and metastasis were
monitored using IVIS Bio Imaging Station. Our results show that deguelin substantially
reduced the primary tumor growth by 73% (7.6×107vs 1.8×107 photons/sec; difference =
5.7×107 photons/sec, 95% Cl = 6.6×107 to 12×108 photons/sec, p>0.087), as compared to
control tumors (Fig. 1A&B). Primary tumor weight was about 63% lesser in deguelintreated mice, as compared to control mice (Fig. 1C). Deguelin was well tolerated by the
mice as depicted by no weight loss or signs of acute or delayed toxicity (Fig. 1D).
Interestingly, deguelin-treated mice developed much lesser metastatic lesions in peritoneum
(Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, control tumors migrated to an average of about 20mm away
from the pancreas, whereas deguelin-treated tumors migrated around 5-6mm, indicating
significant inhibition of tumor cell migration by deguelin (20.3 vs 6.6mm; difference =
13.7mm, 95% Cl= 7 to 20.8, p<0.0006). In fact, 8 out of 10 mice in treated group showed no
metastatic lesions whereas, in the control group, 8 out of 10 mice demonstrated metastatic
lesions (Fig. 2C). Compared to control, deguelin-treated mice exhibited reduced migration
of PanC-1 cells into various organs such as liver, lung, spleen, intestinal mesentery nodules
and abdominal cavity (Fig. 2C&D, indicating that deguelin inhibits the metastasis of
primary implanted tumors to liver and lungs. As liver is the preferential site of metastasis for
most of the pancreatic tumors, we imaged the luminescence in liver. Luciferin was injected
10 min before sacrificing the mice, livers were excised and luminescence was measured by
the imaging system. As shown in Fig. 2E, liver from deguelin-treated mice showed no or
modest luminescence, whereas control mice livers demonstrated strong luminescence
indicating that deguelin significantly inhibits the metastasis of pancreatic tumors to liver.
Deguelin inhibits Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in vivo

Author Manuscript

Since the primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the anti-metastatic potential
of deguelin, we focused further studies on metastasis. Inhibition of pancreatic tumor
metastasis and migration by deguelin in vivo prompted us to examine whether the antimetastatic effect of deguelin was due to the inhibition of EMT. Interestingly, our
immunofluorescence studies show that E-Cadherin expression was increased around 3 fold
and vimentin expression decreased by 80% in the tumors of deguelin treated mice, as
compared to control tumors (Fig. 3A&B), providing a critical clue that deguelin inhibits
EMT in tumors. Similarly, western blot analysis of tumors shows that E-Cadherin

expression was significantly increased, whereas N-Cadherin, vimentin and Snail expressions
were decreased by deguelin treatment. In addition, an increase in cleavage of caspase 3 and
PARP was observed in deguelin-treated tumors, as compared to control tumors (Fig. 3C).
Western blots were quantitated and presented as bar diagram (Fig. 3D).
Deguelin inhibits the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Migration and invasion are the critical steps in metastasis of primary tumors as these
processes help in escaping the primary tumor cells from either blood stream or lymph nodes.
Since deguelin inhibited in vivo migration of PanC-1 xenografts, we wanted to see whether
deguelin could inhibit the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Initially,
we evaluated the cytotoxicity of deguelin in pancreatic cancer cells and found that IC50
(24h) values for PanC-1, COlO-357 and L3.6pl were 62, 27 and 12μM, respectively (Fig.
4A). Cells were treated with sub-lethal dose of deguelin and migration and invasion were
evaluated. Our results show that control PanC-1 cells migrated into 92% of the wound area
by 36h; whereas deguelin treated PanC-1 cells migrated into 49% (Fig. 4B&C) of the wound
area showing 44% of inhibition by deguelin (859 vs 100μm2, difference = 759μm2, 95% Cl
= 625 to 893, p<0.07). Similar observations were made in COLO-357 cells (Fig. 4B&C).
Similarly, deguelin (10μM) also inhibited the invasion of PanC-1, COLO-357 and L3.6pl
cells (58, 77 and 59%, respectively) as evaluated by Boyden's chamber (Fig. 4D).
Deguelin inhibits EMT in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro

Author Manuscript

Since deguelin inhibited the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells from their
parental colonies as compared control cells, we next wanted to see whether deguelin
suppress mesenchymal (metastatic) properties of pancreatic cancer cells and induce
epithelial cell signature along with apoptosis induction. Similar to our in vivo observations,
our results show that deguelin significantly down regulated vimentin, up regulated
cytokeratin 18 and E-Cadherin expression and induced cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in
all the three cell lines in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A & B).
Since Snail is considered to be the main transcriptional repressor of E-Cadherin, we
monitored the expression of Snail in response to deguelin treatment. Interestingly, our
results show that Snail expression was significantly reduced in all the three cells lines in a
dose and time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A&B). However, Snail and E-Cadherin were not
altered by deguelin treatment in normal human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (HPDE-6)
(Fig. 5A, right panel).

Author Manuscript

To differentiate between the cytotoxic effects of deguelin with that of reversal of EMT, we
used gemcitabine, which is a known chemotherapeutic drug used in clinics against
pancreatic cancer. Our results show that gemcitabine treatment decreased the survival of
PanC-1 and COLO-357 cells similar to that of deguelin (Fig. 5C & Fig. 4A). However in
contrast to deguelin, gemcitabine treatment failed to induce E-Cadherin expression or reduce
vimentin expression in pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 5C). In fact, previous reports have
shown that gemcitabine and tamoxifen treated cells acquire EMT phenotype (23-25). Hence,
deguelin is unique as it not only suppresses pancreatic tumor growth but also suppress
metastasis by inhibiting EMT.

Deguelin suppresses TGFβ1-induced EMT

Author Manuscript

Next, we wanted to see whether deguelin induces E-Cadherin expression transcriptionally or
by altering the post-translational degradation. Our RT-PCR analysis shows that E-Cadherin
was transcriptionally up regulated in deguelin treated PanC-1 (Fig. 5D). Surprisingly, the
increase in E-Cadherin protein expression by deguelin treatment in the whole cell lysates did
not correlated exactly as mRNA levels (Fig. 5B & D). E-Cadherin is known to mis-localize
in various portions of the cell such as cytosol and nucleus hence, we wanted to see whether
deguelin alters the localization of E-Cadherin. Interestingly, our results show that membrane
bound E-Cadherin was significantly increased whereas, cytosolic E-Cadherin was down
regulated. However, nuclear E-Cadherin was unaltered in deguelin-treated PanC-1 cells
(Fig. 5D, right panel). Furthermore, β-catenin interaction was increased in deguelin-treated
cell lysates that was immunoprecipitated with E-Cadherin (Fig. 4E), indicating that ECadherin is accumulated in membrane fraction. Immunofluorescence studies further
confirmed the localization of E-Cadherin and its repressor Snail (Fig. 5E, right panel).

Deguelin targets TGFβ1 canonical signaling pathway to inhibit EMT

Family of TGFβ growth factors can initiate and maintain EMT in variety of biological
systems (26). Hence, we wanted to see whether deguelin would inhibit TGFβ1-induced
EMT in pancreatic cancer cells. As shown in Fig 6A, TGFβ1 (10ng/mL) treated PanC-1
cells showed elongated morphology including protruding lamellipodia (Fig. 6A, white
arrows) and scattered from parental colonies (Fig. 6A, black arrows), as compared to control
cells. However, deguelin treatment substantially reduced TGFβ-induced cell morphology in
PanC-1 cells (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, TGFβ1 enhanced the invasion of PanC-1 and
COLO-357 cells in Boyden's chamber by 2.12 and 1.7 fold respectively, as compared to
control cells. Nonetheless, deguelin treatment completely blocked TGFβ1-induced cell
invasion in PanC-1 cells, as compared to TGFβ1 alone treated cells (Fig. 6B).

Single dose of TGFβ (10ng/mL) for 72h significantly induced the mesenchymal signature in
PanC-1 cells (Fig. 6C). Nonetheless, deguelin treatment completely blocked TGFβ1-induced
Snail expression and restored TGFβ1-reduced E-Cadherin expression in both PanC-1 and
COLO-357 cells (Fig. 6C, right panel). In addition, deguelin reduced the phosphorylation of
Smad-3 (Ser-423/425) in PanC-1cells (Fig 6D). Interestingly, Smad-4 expression was not
altered by deguelin treatment however; deguelin treatment completely blocked TGFβ1induced shuttling of Smad4 from cytosol to nucleus (Fig. 6D, right panel).

Deguelin down regulates Snail expression by inhibiting TGFβ1 non-canonical NFkB
pathway
Interestingly, deguelin treatment increased E-Cadherin expression in L3.6pl, BxPC-3 and
MIA PaCa-2 cells (data not shown), which do not have intact functional TGFβ1signaling
due to mutation in Smad4 (L3.6pl and BxPC-3) or lack of TGFβ receptors (MIA PaCa-2)
(27). TGFβ1 is also known to induce EMT in various cancer types by Smad-independent
pathways such as, NFkB (28). Based on these facts, we hypothesized that deguelin could

also target non-canonical TGFβ pathway to inhibit EMT by modulating NFkB. To evaluate
the role of NFkB in TGFβ1-induced EMT, NFkB was silenced using SiRNA in PanC-1 and
COLO-357 cells. As expected, our results show that NFkB-silenced PanC-1 or COLO-357
cells were completely insensitive to TGFβ1-induced EMT (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, we
observed maximum NFkB phosphorylation (Ser-536) and nuclear accumulation after 2h of
TGFβ1 treatment in PanC-1 cells (Fig. 7A, right panel). Since NFkB was a prerequisite for
TGFβ1-induced EMT, we next wanted to evaluate the effect of deguelin on NFkB signaling
pathway. Our results show that deguelin significantly inhibit the constitutive IkB
(Ser-32/34) and NFkB (Ser-536) phosphorylation in pancreatic cells without affecting the
protein levels (Fig 7B). Similarly, TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation of IkB (Ser-32/34) and
NFkB (Ser-536) were also drastically reduced by deguelin treatment (Fig. 7B, right panel).
Furthermore, deguelin significantly reduced the transcriptional activity, DNA binding
activity (Fig. 7C&D) and nuclear localization (Fig. 7D, right panel) of NFkB in PanC-1 and
COLO-357 cells.
Ectopic expression of Snail or NFkB abrogates EMT inhibitory effects of deguelin

Author Manuscript

To confirm the role of NFkB and Snail in deguelin-mediated inhibition of EMT, PanC-1 and
COLO-357 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid-DNA encoding either NFkB or
Snail gene. As expected, over expression of Snail alone significantly diminished the
expression of E-Cadherin, cytokeratin and RKIP, whereas up-regulated the expression of
vimentin in PanC-1 and COLO-357 cells (Fig. 8A&B). However, when Snail
overexpressing cells were treated with deguelin, EMT inhibition mediated by deguelin was
almost completely blocked in PanC-1 and COLO-357 cells (Fig. 8A&B), indicating the
critical role of Snail in deguelin mediated EMT inhibition. Interestingly, NFkB was not
altered significantly by Snail over expression, indicating that NFkB may not be regulated by
Snail in our model (Fig. 8A&B).
Similarly, when NFkB was overexpressed in PanC-1 or COLO-357 cells, E-Cadherin
expression was reduced. On the other hand, expression of N-Cadherin and vimentin was
increased in both the cells (Fig. 8C&D), indicating the role of NFkB in EMT. Interestingly,
NFkB overexpression also resulted in the increased expression of Snail, providing direct
evidence on the role of NFkB in inducing EMT through Snail (Fig. 8C&D). Nonetheless,
when NFkB overexpressing PanC-1 or COLO-357 cells were treated with deguelin, ECadherin induction or vimentin and Snail down regulation was abolished (Fig. 8C&D).
Interestingly, Snail overexpression did not protected the cells from deguelin-induced
apoptosis, whereas NFkB overexpression significantly recued the cells from deguelininduced apoptosis (Fig. 8A-D).

Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the role of deguelin on pancreatic cancer tumor growth
and metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Our results show that deguelin significantly inhibits the
peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis of orthotopically implanted PanC-1-luc cells in
nude mice along with induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, deguelin significantly down
regulated the mesenchymal markers and increased the expression of epithelial markers in

vivo and in vitro, indicating that deguelin targets EMT to inhibit metastasis of pancreatic
tumors along with primary tumor growth. In the present study, we established that deguelin
targets TGFβ1 canonical Smad signaling and non-canonical NFkB signaling pathway to
down regulate Snail expression leading to the induction of E-Cadherin. Deguelin also
suppresses primary pancreatic tumor growth by targeting NFkB.

Author Manuscript

Since pancreatic tumors have high tendency to metastasize to peritoneal organs such as
liver, spleen and intestinal mesentery nodules, peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis
were used as parameters to measure pancreatic tumor metastasis. As compared to control
tumors, deguelin treated tumors reduced peritoneal dissemination and blocked metastasis to
liver. Interestingly, control tumors were more diffused and less compact as compared to
deguelin treated tumors. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that deguelin target
tight junction proteins, which are necessary to bind epithelial cells to each other, to prevent
tumor diffusion (metastasis). E-Cadherin is a tight junction protein that is differentially
expressed in compact and diffused tumors (29, 30), and plays a critical role in tumor
metastasis (31, 32). E-Cadherin expression was significantly increased by deguelin
treatment; whereas mesenchymal markers were decreased in vitro and in vivo confirming
that deguelin inhibits EMT in pancreatic cancer. It appears that up-regulation of E-Cadherin
by deguelin in our model was due to the inhibition of Snail, an endogenous repressor of ECadherin.

Author Manuscript

Surprisingly, the increase in E-Cadherin mRNA by deguelin did not exactly correlated with
the protein expression of E-Cadherin in PanC-1 cells. Furthermore, the extent of Snail down
regulation also did not correlated with E-Cadherin up regulation as expected. One plausible
reason could be that concomitant with Snail down regulation, deguelin might be activating
other E-Cadherin repressors such as Slug and Twist. However, both the repressors Slug and
Twist were down regulated by deguelin treatment (data not shown). Another possibility
which exists is the localization of E-Cadherin. Primarily, E-Cadherin is expressed as
transmembrane protein that interacts with β-catenin to maintain cell-cell adhesion (33).
Salahshor et al. have reported that 24% pancreatic tumors show abnormal localization of ECadherin in the cytosol and nucleus (34). Thus we hypothesized that overall increase in ECadherin expression by deguelin treatment was due to the increase in membrane bound ECadherin. In agreement with our hypothesis, deguelin significantly down regulated ECadherin expression in cytosolic fraction whereas increased its expression in the membrane
fraction of the cells. Our hypothesis was also strengthened by the observation that ECadherin and β-catenin interactions were increased in deguelin-treated PanC-1 cells,
confirming that more E-Cadherin was accumulated in membrane fraction.

EMT can be induced or regulated by various growth factors such as TGFβ1, FGF, HGF,
PDGF, Wnt and Notch (7). TGFβ is known to induce EMT by Smad-dependent (canonical)
and Smad-independent (non-canonical) pathways (28). It is possible that deguelin
specifically targets R-Smads to inhibit TGFβ1 signaling as Smad3 activation (Ser-423/425)
was significantly suppressed by deguelin in TGFβ1primed cells, without affecting the
protein levels of Smad4. TGFβ1 modulate NFkB activity in certain epithelial cells (8, 35)
and NFkB is essential for TGFβ1-induced EMT in certain cancers such as breast cancer
(11). Interestingly, when NFkB was silenced in PanC-1 and COLO-357 cells and treated

with TGFβ1, TGFβ1-induced Snail induction and E-Cadherin down-regulation was
completely prevented. NFkB overexpression induced Snail expression and down regulated
E-Cadherin in PanC-1 and COLO-357 cells. On the other hand, TGFβ1 treatment resulted in
the phosphorylation of IkB (Ser-32) and NFkB (Ser-536). Taken together, these
observations indicate that NFkB-Snail pathway is indispensable for TGFβ1-induced EMT in
pancreatic cancer cells. Interestingly, deguelin significantly inhibited both constitutive and
TGFβ1-induced activation of IkB (Ser-32/34) and NFkB (Ser-536) in PanC-1 cells and
orthotopically implanted tumors. Furthermore, overexpression of either NFkB or Snail
completely abrogated EMT inhibition by deguelin, indicating that deguelin targets NFkBSnail pathway to inhibit EMT in pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, ectopic expression of
NFkB induced Snail expression but Snail overexpression did not induced NFkB expression,
indicating that NFkB acts upstream and regulates Snail in our model.

Author Manuscript

There could be two possible mechanisms by which deguelin inhibit NFkB activation in
pancreatic cancer cells: (a) TGFβ1 induce NFkB nuclear localization by TGFβ Activated
Kinase (TAK1) dependent IkB phosphorylation (8), and (b) RKIP mediated inhibition of
NFkB activation by interacting with various up stream kinases such as NIK and TAK1
(36-38). Deguelin significantly inhibited TAK1-induced phosphorylation of IkB (Ser-32) in
TGFβ-treated cells. Inhibition of IkB phosphorylation by deguelin lead to stabilization of
NFkB-IkB interaction thus prevent nuclear translocation of NFkB and obligatory TGFβ1induced Snail induction. Since, deguelin treatment significantly induced RKIP expression, it
could lead to the inhibition of NFkB activation.

Author Manuscript

To evaluate whether deguelin-induced reversal of EMT and apoptosis induction were
through a common pathway, induction of apoptosis (Cl. Caspase-3 and Cl. PARP) was
evaluated in deguelin-treated NFkB or Snail overexpressing PanC-1 and COLO-357 cells.
Interestingly, deguelin-induced apoptosis was completely blocked in NFkB overexpressing
cells but not in Snail overexpressing cells. Nevertheless, EMT reversal by deguelin was
significantly blocked in both NFkB and Snail overexpressing cells. These results suggest
that upstream regulator, such as NFkB play significant role in both deguelin-induced
reversal of EMT and apoptosis process, however the downstream effectors are different. For
example, Snail overexpression failed to protect the cells from deguelin-induced apoptosis
but significantly prevented EMT reversal suggesting that Snail or EMT plays no role in the
apoptosis induction through deguelin in our model. A schematic diagram of deguelin targets
presented in Fig. 9.
In conclusion, deguelin suppresses both pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis by inducing
apoptosis and inhibiting epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

PanC-1-luc cells were orthotopically implanted in the pancreas of nude mice, as described
by us earlier (40). All the experiments involving animals were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Twenty 4-6 week old female athymic nude
mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were kept on an antioxidant-free AIN-76A diet
(TestDiet, Richmond, IN) during the experiment. The mice were used in each group to get
better statistical difference. Sample size was calculated using the software developed by
DuPont and Plummer. The following parameters were used to calculate the sample size: α
(0.1), δ (0.5), σ (0.5) and power (0.9) (41). Animals were anesthetized by KetamineXylazine-Acepromazine mixture and a small left abdominal flank incision was made.
Around 1×106 exponentially growing PanC-1-luc cells suspended in 20μL PBS were
injected into the subcapsular region of the pancreas. The peritoneum and skin incisions were
closed sequentially with absorbable suture. Animals were imaged on the next day of surgery
for basal luminescence using IVIS Bio Luminescent System equipped with Living Image
software (Caliper LifeSciences, MA). After seven days, mice were randomly separated into
two groups with 10 mice in each group. Mice in the experimental group received 5mg/Kg
deguelin (daily, i.p, 37 days), whereas the control mice received vehicle alone. Dose of the
deguelin was selected based on previously published literature (42-44). Tumor luminescence
and animal weight was measured twice a week for six weeks. At the end of the experiment
(Day 45), mice were sacrificed; tumors and pancreas were excised from each mouse
weighed and snap frozen for western blot, and immunohistochemical analysis. Tumor
migration from the site of injection was measured by Living Image software (Caliper
LifeSciences, MA).

TGF-β1 treatment

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in a 6-well plate at a density of 0.3×106 cells/well and left overnight. Next
day, cells were serum starved overnight and media was replaced with fresh media containing
10ng/mL TGF-β1. After 48h of incubation, various concentrations of deguelin were added to
TGF-β1-treated cells and co-incubated for additional 24h. Cells were collected and subjected
to either western blot analysis or immunostained and observed under microscope.
NFkB transcriptional activity and DNA binding (EMSA)
PanC-1 or COLO-357 cells were treated with deguelin (10μM) for 24h and nuclear and
cytosolic fractions were collected. NFkB DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity
was measured as described by us earlier (47).

Transient transfections
PanC-1 or COLO-357 cells were transiently reverse-transfected with either NFkB or Snail
over expressing plasmids using FuGene 6 (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, IN) transfection
reagent, according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, either 2μg of NFkB-plasmid-DNA
or 1.5μg of Snail-plasmid-DNA for PanC-1 and 3μg of NFkB-plasmid-DNA or 2μg of Snailplasmid-DNA for COLO-357 was diluted separately in Opti-MEM media to which FuGene
transfection reagent was added in a ratio of 1:3 (w:v) and incubated at RT for 1h in a 6-well
plate. After incubation, Panc-1 or COLO-357 cells were trypsinized and around 0.3×106cells
were added separately to DNA-FuGene complexes formed in the 6-well plates and
incubated for another 5h. Medium was replaced with fresh media and incubated for
additional 48h. Transfected cells were either treated with 0.1% DMSO or deguelin (10μM)
for 24h. Cells were collected and subjected to western blot analysis.

Author Manuscript

Western blot analysis
Treated and control cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitors by incubating on ice for 20 min. The protein concentration was
estimated by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Hercules, CA). Forty microgram of protein was
resolved on 10-12% SDS-PAGE and transferred on to PVDF membrane for western blot
analysis as described by us previously (45, 48).
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

All the statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5.0 software (Graph Pad software
Inc., San Diego, CA). Results were expressed as mean ± SD of the at least three independent
experiments. Data was analyzed by Student's t-test or one way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni's post hoc analysis for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered
statistically significant at p<0.05.

Figure 9. Deguelin targets canonical and non-canonical TGFβ1 pathway to inhibit EMT and
metastasis

Author Manuscript

TGFβ1 is known to induce EMT by both Smad-dependent and Smad-dependent pathways.
In canonical pathway, upon binding to its receptor TGFβ1 leads to the activation of RSmads such as Smad2 and Smad3. The activated R-Smads binds to co-Smads such as
Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus leading to Snail up regulation and eventually EMT.
In TGFβ1-non canonical pathway, TGFβ1 receptors activate various downstream molecules
such as NFkB and MAPK. TGFβ1 is known to activate TAK1, which in turn phosphorylates
NFkB inhibitor IkB leading to the proteosomal degradation of IkB. IkB-free NFkB
translocate to nucleus and induce Snail expression, which leads to E-Cadherin down
regulation.★ indicates deguelin potential targets.
