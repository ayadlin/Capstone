ABSTRACT
Precision oncology trials based on tumor gene sequencing depend on robust
knowledge about the phenotypic consequences of the genetic variants identified in
patients’ tumors. Mutations in AKT1-3 occur in 3-5% of human cancers. Although a
single hotspot mutation, E17K, is the most common, well characterized activating
mutations account for a minority of Akt variants that have been identified in large
tumor sequencing studies to date. In order to determine the potential clinical
relevance of both common and rare Akt mutations, we expressed a set of over twenty
recurrent Akt mutants in three different cell lines and evaluated activation of Akt
pathway signaling and effects on growth. We determined their relative sensitivity
to allosteric and ATP-competitive Akt inhibitors in clinical development. Most Akt
mutants did not activate pathway signaling compared to wild type Akt and did not
affect growth properties. In addition, the most common activating Akt mutations,
including Akt1 E17K, L52R, and Q79K conferred neither sensitivity nor resistance
to Akt inhibitors. Equivocal evidence was found that Akt1 D323H and Akt2 W80C
mutants are relatively resistant to the allosteric Akt inhibitor MK-2206, but not an
ATP-competitive inhibitor. Our results suggest that the vast majority of rare Akt
variants are passenger mutations with no effect on drug sensitivity. The hypothesis
that activating Akt mutations predict for Akt inhibitor sensitivity remains to be tested
clinically, but is not yet supported by our preclinical data.

INTRODUCTION

become apparent when one attempts to implement such
a program in clinical research or clinical practice. First,
tumor sequencing identifies genetic variants of unknown
significance—even when they occur in well accepted
oncogenes. One cannot assume that all variants in a known
oncogene are functionally activating. Passenger mutations
may occur even in a known oncogene, and the cancer may
not in fact be “addicted” to this mutant gene. Second, not
all activating mutations in an oncogene will confer the
same susceptibility to targeted inhibitors. For example, a
small percentage of B-Raf mutant cancers have non-V600
mutations which have been shown to result in a kinasedead form of B-Raf that nonetheless activates the MAPK
pathway via C-Raf [1]. Such mutants are not sensitive
to the B-Raf V600-specific inhibitors vemurafenib and
dabrafenib. For these reasons it is imperative to have as
much specific information about the functional activity of

With the recent explosion in knowledge of cancer
genetics and widespread availability of tumor whole
exome or targeted sequencing for clinical decisionmaking, large clinical trial efforts are underway to
implement personalized or “precision” oncology
approaches. In simplest form these approaches rely on
a tumor’s somatic mutation profile to determine which
mutations are drivers of tumor growth and the subset
of such mutations which are considered “actionable,”
meaning they are thought be drivers and are also
potentially targetable by an approved or investigational
drug available for use. Actionable mutations in a given
gene are used as the basis for selection of an appropriate
targeted therapy. Although there are clear examples
of the success of this strategy, several practical issues

these mutations as possible to optimally apply precision
oncology in the clinic. Although the highest level of
evidence is from actual patients who have these mutations
and are treated with targeted inhibitors, such information
will be difficult to collect for relatively rare variants.
Preclinical functional analysis may serve in the interim
to provide the best available evidence for matching gene
variants to targeted therapies.
Mutations in the highly homologous kinases AKT1,
AKT2, or AKT3 occur in approximately 3-5% of cancers.
A single hotspot mutation G49A:E17K occurs most often
in AKT1, but the corresponding E17K mutation has also
been found in AKT2 and AKT3 [2]. E17K accounts for
36% of AKT1 mutations in cBioPortal but is less prevalent
in AKT2 and AKT3. The majority of AKT1-3 mutations are
spread throughout the coding sequence at low frequencies
(Figure 1A) [3]. Two major classes of Akt inhibitors are
being investigated in clinical trials: allosteric inhibitors
and ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors. A number of
active or planned clinical trials use AKT mutations to
determine eligibility for these agents. Previous work
from our laboratory and others have identified additional
activating mutations in the PH domain of AKT1-3 [4-6].
Activating kinase domain mutations were also identified
by Parikh et al., who proposed that most activating Akt
mutations disrupted autoinhibitory PH-kinase domain
interactions [4]. Known activating Akt mutations have
not been extensively tested for sensitivity to different
classes of inhibitors being tested in clinical trials.
We therefore sought to determine whether a series of
recurrently mutated amino acids across Akt isoforms
were functionally activating and whether these mutations
conferred either sensitivity or resistance to allosteric or
ATP-competitive Akt inhibitors.

given residue were evaluated (e.g. Akt2 D32H and D32N,
although the former did not express well), whereas in
other cases a single variant at a given position was chosen
for study (e.g. Akt2 W80C). Although some of the mutants
chosen for study occur in AKT3, we used only AKT1 and
AKT2 for our analysis, since all of these AKT3 mutants
had a homologous mutant in AKT1 or AKT2. While there
are some data showing isoform-specific functions that
differ between Akt1 and Akt2, the signaling pathway is
highly conserved, and few functional differences have
been described for Akt3 versus Akt2. In order to observe
phenotypic similarities across different cellular contexts,
we expressed our mutant panel in IL-3-dependent BaF3
murine pro-B cells, Rat1a fibroblasts, and MCF-10A, an
EGF-dependent immortalized human breast epithelial cell
line. Akt1 L52R and Q79K mutants were not expressed in
BaF3, as we and others had previously demonstrated that
these mutants activated signaling in multiple cell types and
have transforming activity [4, 5].
We first investigated whether these mutations
activated Akt and Akt-dependent signaling by western
blotting. Known activating mutants of Akt cause increased
baseline phosphorylation at the S473/474 and T308/309
residues (of Akt1 and Akt2, respectively), which are
essential for full activation of the Akt kinases. This in
turn leads to increased phosphorylation of canonical
downstream Akt targets, such as PRAS40. As shown
in Figure 2, wild type Akt1 or Akt2 overexpression
could lead to modest increases in pathway activity in
IL-3 deprived BaF3 cells (Figure 2A) or serum-starved
Rat1 cells (Figure 2B). The known activating mutants
Akt1 E17K, L52R, Q79K, and D323H all demonstrated
increased Akt and PRAS40 phosphorylation compared to
wild type. None of the other non-hotspot Akt1 mutants
showed clear evidence of activation greater than wild type
Akt1. These same mutants exhibited similar activity when
overexpressed in the breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A;
however, the expression levels of the mutants were more
variable in this cell line, with lower expression of the
most strongly activating mutants (Figure 2C). This may
indicate an intolerance of the MCF-10A cells to such high
Akt pathway activity, a phenomenon we have previously
observed when MCF-10A PIK3CA mutant knock-in cells
are maintained in high-EGF culture media [9].
Similarly, for Akt2, the E17K mutant clearly
activated the pathway, but none of the other mutants
tested, with the exception of the PH domain mutant
W80C, showed pathway activity above wild type Akt2.
Akt2 W80C increased phosphorylation of Akt2 S474 and
PRAS40 in BaF3 and of Akt2 S474 alone in Rat1a and
MCF-10A, suggesting that this mutation may be weakly
activating.

RESULTS
Functional analysis of pathway signaling by low
frequency AKT mutants
We curated a dataset of mutations in AKT1-3 from
COSMIC, TCGA, and individual tumor sequencing
studies reported in the literature [3, 7, 8]. We also
considered reported mutations in mosaic overgrowth
syndromes which frequently involve PI3K pathway
genes. Mutations that occurred more than once at the
same conserved amino acid residue or homologous residue
across Akt isoforms, but which had not already been
functionally characterized, were chosen for study (Figure
1B). Full length cDNA of wild type or mutant AKT1 or
AKT2 were cloned into a retroviral expression vector with
an in-frame N-terminal HA epitope tag and infected into
several cell lines to generate stable expressing pools of
cells. In some cases, multiple variant amino acids at a

were not tested in BaF3, as we and others have previously
shown that they have oncogenic properties [4, 5]. We had
previously demonstrated that targeted knock-in of the
AKT1 E17K mutation in MCF-10A cells is insufficient
to cause EGF independence, but the possibility remained
that supraphysiologic expression of Akt mutants might
lead to growth factor independence [10]. MCF-10A cells
expressing the panel of Akt mutants remained completely
dependent on EGF for growth, however, although

To further characterize the oncogenic properties of
these mutants, we tested their ability to maintain survival
of BaF3 cells after withdrawal of IL-3. As shown in Figure
3A, only the Akt1 E17K, Akt2 E17K, and Akt1 D323H
mutants promoted BaF3 survival compared to wild type
Akt proteins. Note that the Akt1 L52R and Q79K mutants

PIK3CA E545K mutant knock-in MCF-10A cells grew
without EGF as expected (Figure 3B) [9]. Some groups
have reported that overexpression of activated forms
of Akt can lead to aberrant morphogenesis phenotypes
when MCF-10A cells are cultured in a three dimensional
basement membrane matrix (Matrigel), although our
MCF-10A AKT1 E17K knock-in cells resembled wild
type MCF-10A cells in this assay [4, 10]. We therefore

tested whether our panel of AKT mutants would lead to
aberrant acinar morphogenesis in Matrigel. Again, none
of the mutants, including known activating mutants, was
capable of transforming MCF-10A cells in this assay. All
acini showed normal morphology (data not shown).
Rat1a cells expressing the mutants grew with
similar kinetics to empty vector control and wild type Aktexpressing cells (Figure 3C). However, after becoming

can still modify pathway signaling through PH-dependent,
but kinase-independent, mechanisms, potentially affecting
drug sensitivity [16]. In theory then, a mutation could
affect drug binding or activity, which could allow the
mutant Akt protein to maintain Akt signaling despite not
itself being an activating mutant. We therefore tested
our entire panel of Akt mutants for effects on cellular
sensitivity to MK-2206 and GSK690693.
In all cell lines tested, the Akt1 E17K, Akt2 E17K,
Akt1 L52R, and Akt1 Q79K mutants showed similar
sensitivity to empty vector and wild type Akt-expressing
cells to both MK-2206 and GSK690693, indicating that
these PH-domain mutants do not confer either sensitivity
or resistance to these agents to a significant degree
(Figures 4, 5, 6 and Supplementary Figures 1 and 2).
Rat1a cells tested in full serum showed no sensitivity to
MK-2206 up to 3.3 microM, but then were completely
killed at 10 microM, with no separation of the curves,
indicating an insignificant degree of variation among
the different mutants (Figure 4). A subset of the mutants
was re-tested in low serum conditions, and again the
therapeutic response profile was similar with 70-80%
growth inhibition at 1 microM MK-2206 (Figure 6B).
Although Akt1 E17K, Akt1 D46H, and Akt1 D323H
differ significantly (P < 0.05) from wild type, the
observed differences in growth inhibition are small. The
only exceptions to this rule were the Akt1 D323H and
Akt2 W80C mutants, which were more resistant to MK-

Akt mutation effects on sensitivity to Akt
inhibitors
Two classes of Akt inhibitors in clinical trials
are allosteric inhibitors, such as MK-2206, and ATPcompetitive kinase inhibitors, such as GSK690693,
AZD5363, and GSK2141795 [11-14]. It remains uncertain
to what extent activating AKT mutations predict for
enhanced sensitivity to such agents. Some reports have
suggested that certain mutants such as E17K, L52R, and
D323H are more resistant to an allosteric inhibitor, Akt
inhibitor VIII, although we observed potent biochemical
inhibition by MK-2206 of Akt1 E17K in two knock-in cell
line models and equivalent growth inhibition compared
to isogenic wild type cells [4, 15, 16]. The Q79K mutant
has been shown to respond to MK-2206 in vitro, although
relative sensitivities of this and other mutants to various
inhibitors have not been established [6]. The artificial
W80A PH domain mutation has been reported to confer
resistance to allosteric Akt inhibitors, including Akt
inhibitor VIII and MK-2206 [16-19]. It has also been
shown recently that certain kinase-inactive Akt mutants

2206 when expressed in the MCF-10A cell line (Figure
5). However, the IC50 difference was significant only for
W80C after correction for multiple comparisons (p < 0.01;
Supplementary Figure 1). These two mutants did not cause
resistance to MK-2206 in Rat1a or BaF3 cells, however
(Figures 4 and 6 and Supplementary Figure 2). Both
mutants were as effectively inhibited by GSK690693 as
the rest of the mutant panel in both Rat1a and MCF-10A
cells (Figures 4 and 5).

their role may vary depending on the cell of origin, as well
as the genetic and epigenetic context of the tumor. Second,
the effects of many mutations (especially non-hotspot
mutations) in known oncogenes on protein function and
drug sensitivity are unknown, and all variants cannot be
assumed to be activating and drug-sensitizing.
AKT mutations highlight these issues for precision
oncology. Akt proteins are clearly oncoproteins, and
overexpression of activated Akt isoforms can transform
cells. The only true hotspot mutation in AKT1-3 is
E17K, however. Its high frequency (~15% of all AKT13 mutations in cBioPortal) suggests that it is a bona fide
driver, and multiple studies, including this one, have
shown that E17K activates the Akt signaling pathway
and can transform cells. However, non-E17K mutations
will account for the majority of AKT mutations identified
by clinical tumor exome sequencing, and there has been
little functional characterization of these rare mutations.
In this study we tested 23 different amino acid residues
for which we could find at least two mutation instances in
the literature and sequencing databases. Only the E17K
mutants of Akt1 and Akt2 and the previously validated
Akt1 L52R, Q79K, and D323H mutants showed clear
pathway activation compared to wild type Akt, and only
these mutants showed oncogenic activity in terms of
IL-3 independent survival of BaF3 or transformation of
Rat1a [4, 5]. L52R and Q79K mutations represent 1.2%
each of AKT1-3 mutations in cBioPortal, which is only

DISCUSSION
Large scale tumor sequencing studies have been
successful in identifying the landscape of driver oncogenes
in human cancers. Taken to the next level, clinical
sequencing of tumors is being used for personalized
oncology, with the notion that sequencing can identify
the likely drivers in an individual patient’s cancer. The
secondary assumption is that the presence of such a mutant
driver will predict clinical benefit when a drug targeting
that driver is used. As we show in this study, there are
important caveats to this approach. First, although
sequencing is good at identifying tumor drivers in general
(i.e., Akt proteins are clearly human oncogenes), clinical
sequencing is less robust for identifying the drivers in any
particular individual’s cancer. Certain oncogenic drivers
are clearly more potent, or more addicting than others, and

slightly higher than our threshold frequency, representing
occurrence at least twice in reported studies (equivalent to
~0.6%). Mutations in the R370/R371/R367 residues are as
prevalent in COSMIC as L52/L51 or D323/D324 (1.2%),
but these mutations do not appear to be activating. It is
likely that with the accumulation of more sequencing data,
we will have a better understanding of the true frequency
of these different mutations, and perhaps a clearer
distinction between potential drivers and passengers based

on frequency of occurrence will emerge. Another caveat
is that we did not test additional mutations with only a
single reported occurrence. We and others have identified
a few activating AKT1 mutants which have been reported
only once, so it remains possible that additional rare
activating mutations will be found. However, our study
suggests that the vast majority of such rare mutations will
be passengers.
It is difficult to rule out the possibility that some

of these Akt mutants have a gain of function and role in
transformation that is simply too weak to be observed in
the assays we performed, or which impacts a phenotype
that we did not study. The context-dependent phenotypic
effects observed by Parikh et al. for certain Akt mutants
suggest that there could be subtle aspects of oncogene
activity that vary with biological context. For example,
Akt1 K189N increased Akt phosphorylation in MCF-10A
but did not promote IL-3 independent growth in BaF3
in the study by Parikh. In our study we saw inconsistent
effects of overexpression of some of the mutants. Akt2
W80C increased phosphorylation of Akt2 S474 and
PRAS40 in BaF3 and of Akt2 S474 alone in Rat1a and
MCF-10A. W80C did not score as positive in our BaF3
proliferation assay, but it is possible that this mutation is
weakly activating. It is notable that W80 is adjacent to
other PH domain residues activated by mutation, including
C77 and Q79, and artificial mutation of T81 also activates
Akt [4].
An expectation of precision oncology is that
matching targeted therapies with driver mutations will
result in improved responses and survival for patients. The
common E17K mutant, and the rarer L52R, Q79K, and
D323H mutants are all clearly activating and capable of
driving transformation. None of these mutants render cells
more sensitive to allosteric or ATP-competitive inhibitors
compared to wild type Akt, however. In previous work
we showed that two different AKT1 E17K knock-in cell
lines were no more sensitive than their isogenic wild
type controls to MK-2206, and overexpression of E17K,
L52R, and Q79K did not sensitize BaF3, Rat1a, or MCF10A cells to either MK-2206 or GSK690693 in the current
study. A limitation of all of these studies is the possibility
that a cell engineered to express a mutation may not
become “addicted” to this driver in the same way that
an autochthonous driver mutation might. However, we
have shown that engineered knock-in of hotspot PIK3CA
mutations can indeed sensitize these cells to PI3-kinase
inhibitors [9, 10].
Another important clinical use of mutation data
for precision oncology is to avoid using drugs to which a
given mutation confers resistance. Our data suggest that
the most common functionally activating Akt mutations,
E17K, L52R, and Q79K, are not inherently resistant to
MK-2206 or GSK690693. The W80C and D323H mutants
did show resistance to MK-2206, but not GSK690693, in
a single cell line, MCF-10A. Our results with W80C agree
with those of Parikh et al. and Vivanco et al. who found
that the artificial W80A mutant was resistant to either Akt
inhibitor VIII or MK-2206 in different cell lines [4, 16].
However, we found MK-2206 to be effective against the
E17K and L52R mutants in multiple cell lines, whereas
Parikh et al. observed little to no growth inhibition in
NIH3T3 cells expressing these mutants when treated with
Akt inhibitor VIII. It is possible that the different results
with MK-2206 reflect structural differences between the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

two allosteric inhibitors. Recently Davies et al. also found
efficacy of MK-2206 against Akt1 E17K mutant cell lines
and xenografts[20]. Like Parikh et al., we found the Akt1
D323H mutant to be relatively resistant to an allosteric
Akt inhibitor; however, we only observed this effect in a
single cell line, and the shift in IC50 was not statistically
significant. It is possible that these mutants exhibit a
context-dependent resistance to allosteric inhibitors, which
may be clarified by further preclinical and eventual clinical
data. Until such data are available, caution is suggested in
using allosteric inhibitors for W80 and D323 mutations.
In summary, the “long tail” of low frequency,
uncharacterized mutations in the AKT1-3 genes in human
tumors is emblematic of challenges facing the field of
precision oncology. Our study highlights the possibility
that the majority of sequence variants identified in the
AKT genes will be passenger mutations without clear
functional consequences. Such mutations should not be
used to prescribe Akt-targeted therapies to patients. For
the subset of validated activating Akt mutations, including
E17K, the clinical utility of a precision oncology strategy
remains unclear. Preclinical data, including ours, has not
shown a clear signal of increased sensitivity of Akt mutant
cells to Akt inhibitors; however, this hypothesis remains
a valid one to be tested in clinical trials. Recent reports
have documented responses of a few Akt1 E17K mutant
tumors to Akt inhibitors in patient-derived xenografts
and phase I clinical trials [20, 21]. Ultimately more data
from patients with AKT mutant tumors will be required to
determine how well AKT mutations predict such clinical
benefit. Of course, Akt may still be a good therapeutic
target even if mutant proteins do not confer increased
clinical benefit over wild type; the implication would only
be that mutations need not be used for selection of Akttargeted therapies.

concentration. The following day, medium was replaced
with fresh complete medium containing DMSO vehicle
or MK-2206 or GSK690693 (Selleck Chemicals) at the
indicated concentrations. On day 6, medium containing
10% Alamar Blue (Invitrogen) was added, and plates were
incubated at 37oC for 6 hours before reading absorbance
on a plate reader (Omega). Rat1a cells were tested in both
complete medium with 10% FBS as well as low (0.5%
FBS) serum conditions. MCF-10A cells were grown in
complete MCF-10A medium containing 0.2 ng/mL EGF
(1% of standard EGF concentration in complete MCF-10A
medium). BaF3 cells were tested in medium containing
0.1 ng/mL IL-3.

Wild type and mutant versions of human Akt1
and Akt2 coding sequence were cloned by PCR either
directly from human cDNA or using PCR mutagenesis to
introduce the various AKT mutations. Primer sequences
are available on request. The cDNA inserts containing a
Kozak consensus sequence and stop codon were cloned
into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pBABEpuroL-HA
retroviral vector (derived from pBABEpuroL-PTEN,
Addgene plasmid 10785, by excising the PTEN coding
sequence). All sequences were verified by sequencing both
strands at the Johns Hopkins Synthesis and Sequencing
Facility. Constructs were packaged into VSV-G envelope
pseudotyped retroviruses by transiently transfecting 293T
cells using FuGENE 6 (Promega). Stable pools of cells
were selected and maintained in puromycin (Invitrogen).

Immunoblotting

Cell viability data were plotted using Excel
(Microsoft). For IC50 determination, the same data were
plotted using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows
(GraphPad Software; www.graphpad.com) and curvefit using a three parameter non-linear dose-response
least squares fit. Statistical comparison of IC50 values
was performed using one way ANOVA using Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test with Akt1 or Akt2 wild type as
control. A p < 0.05 was chosen as significant.

Whole-cell protein extracts prepared in Laemmli

medium at 5,000 cells per well in 24-well plates, which
were fixed and stained with crystal violet after three days.
