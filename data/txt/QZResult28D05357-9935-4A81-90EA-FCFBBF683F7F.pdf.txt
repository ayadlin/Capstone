BACKGROUND. Current salvage therapy for recurrent high-risk neuroblastoma is
rarely curative. Assessment of the effectiveness of new, primarily cytostatic agents
requires the redefinition of study endpoints to reflect disease stabilization rather
than tumor response or regression. The intervals of disease control in the
patients in the current study with recurrent neuroblastoma were characterized to

METHODS. Disease control intervals, disease-free survival, postrecurrence survival,

neuroblastoma protocols.

RESULTS. The estimated median time to disease recurrence was 18.3 months
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 15.9–22.4 months) for the first recurrence, 8.7
months (95% CI, 5.0–12.2 months) for the second recurrence, and 3.8 months
(95% CI, 2.5–5.4 months) for the third recurrence. The 5-year estimate of survival
after the first disease recurrence was 11%  4%. Patients with longer initial disease control had a postrecurrence survival advantage:the 5-year estimated postrecurrence survival was 15.3%  6.3% for patients with initial disease control 16
months and 8.1%  5.5% for others (P 5 .006). The median disease control interval was approximately halved after each disease recurrence.

CONCLUSIONS. The previous disease control interval should be considered in
stratification schemes for future phase 2 testing of new agents for the treatment
of neuroblastoma. For the optimal evaluation of new treatment strategies that
incorporate cytostatic agents, study design and selection of endpoints must take
into account the current patterns of recurrence or progression of neuroblastoma.

euroblastoma is advanced at the time of presentation in
approximately 50% of patients, and long-term survival rates are
suboptimal in these cases.1,2 Multimodal therapy incorporating intensive cytoreductive chemotherapy, surgery, irradiation, and subsequent treatment for minimal residual disease was found to improve
event-free survival in 2 recent large cooperative group studies.3–5
Retreatment with standard therapies after disease recurrence can
produce brief second or subsequent remissions, but many patients
have a poor response. Approximately one-third of patients have no
meaningful response to second-line therapy.6 The majority of
patients die due to recurrent neuroblastoma, and therefore new
approaches to treatment are needed.7,8
Several new agents that target specific signaling pathways or
cellular processes offer potential alternative postrecurrence therapies (either as single agents or in combination with standard cytotoxic agents). However, many of these new agents are primarily

cytostatic (likely to produce disease stabilization
rather than regression), and therefore tumor
response (regression) is not a useful criterion of their
efficacy. The accurate assessment of the activity of
these agents requires study endpoints based on
intervals of disease progression (or control). We
reviewed the records of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who were treated on 3 recent institutional protocols to characterize their disease-free
survival and postrecurrence survival intervals. These
intervals can serve as reference points for the evaluation of new agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment
We examined the records of all 91 patients with
newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma (defined
on the basis of age, stage, and biologic features) treated at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital between
January 1991 and June 2002 on 3 institutional frontline protocols (NB8814, NB91, and NB97). Details of
these protocols have been reported previously.9–12
Briefly, patients received induction chemotherapy
with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide (pharmacokinetically guided
dosing of topotecan began in the NB97 protocol),
surgical resection of the primary tumor after remission induction, locoregional radiotherapy as appropriate, and continuation chemotherapy (NB88
protocol) or consolidation with autologous stem cell
transplantation and maintenance with interferon-a
(NB91 protocol) or cis-retinoic acid (NB97 protocol).
Twenty-three patients were enrolled on the NB8814
protocol, 38 on the NB91 protocol, and 30 on the
NB97 protocol. One patient was excluded from this
analysis because of discrepancy in stage assignment.
Thus, a total of 90 patients are reported here.
Patients were staged at the time of diagnosis and at
the time of disease recurrence according to the
guidelines of the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS). Disease recurrence was confirmed by histologic findings (biopsy of bone marrow
or lesion[s]) or by unequivocal meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan findings. Clinical characteristics
(age, sex, race, primary tumor site, stage, and tumor
MYCN status) and outcome data were obtained.
The majority of the disease recurrences in this
patient population were systemic (bone marrow, skeletal, lymph node, central nervous system, or hepatic) and thus salvage attempts used primarily
chemotherapy. Twenty-eight patients in first disease
recurrence were treated with a regimen combining
ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE); 19 were

2797

treated with a topotecan-containing or irinotecancontaining regimen; 4 were treated with a taxanecontaining regimen; 2 received cyclophosphamide
and etoposide; and the remaining patients received
phase 1 agents (oxaliplatin or fenretinide).
Nineteen patients were treated for second disease recurrence with a camptothecin, 11 patients
were treated with an alkylator with or without an
anthracycline or platinating agent, 3 patients were
treated with an ICE regimen, and the remaining
patients were treated with various phase 1 agents
(tumor vaccines, hydroxyurea, interferons, etc) or
allogeneic- or -matched unrelated stem cell transplantation.
All protocols and this analysis were approved by
the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Institutional
Review Board (IRB) and informed consent was
obtained from patients, parents, or guardians for the
therapeutic protocols. The IRB waived consent
requirements for the retrospective review of the data
and for our analysis.

Statistical Methods
Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the time
interval between frontline study enrollment and first
disease recurrence, progression, or most recent contact. Postrecurrence survival (PRS) was defined as the
time interval between first disease recurrence and
death or most recent contact. The DFS and PRS were
estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier13;
standard errors were calculated using the method of
Peto and Pike.14 The median time to disease recurrence and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were
estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The
observed median time to disease recurrence was also
calculated for patients who experienced disease progression or recurrence, although the primary analyses were those based on time-to-event methods. The
exact log-rank test was used to compare PRS distributions by time to first recurrence. An event was
defined as disease recurrence, disease progression,
second malignancy, or death.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of the 90 patients, 66 (73%) had experienced disease
recurrence or disease progression at the time of last
follow-up (78%, 68%, and 77% of patients enrolled
on the NB8814, NB91, and NB97 protocols, respectively). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the
patient group overall and according to disease recurrence/progression status. MYCN status was available
for 85% of patients.

Follow-up
Only 5 (8%) of the 66 patients who had experienced
recurrent or progressive disease remained alive and
free of disease 13.7 years, 8.5 years, 6.0 years, 5.5
years, and 5.3 years, respectively, after frontline study
enrollment. All 24 patients who had not experienced
disease recurrence or progression were alive at a median of 10.0 years (range, 4.0–16.4 years) after frontline study enrollment. Of the 29 survivors, 24 (83%)
had been seen or contacted within the past year and
28 (97%) had been seen or contacted within the past
3 years.
Outcome
In the patient group as a whole, the first event was
disease recurrence or progression in 66 patients
(73%). The remaining 24 patients had no adverse
events. The 5-year DFS estimate for all patients was
26.7%  4.7%. The median time to first disease recurrence after frontline study enrollment was 18.3
months (95% CI, 15.9–22.4 months).

For the 66 patients who had developed disease
recurrence or progressive disease, the 5-year estimate
of PRS was 11.1%  4.3% (Fig. 1). Longer initial
disease control was significantly associated with longer survival after disease recurrence. As depicted in

Neuroblastoma Control Intervals/Santana et al.

FIGURE 2. Survival estimates after first recurrence according to timing of
first recurrence. Patients whose first recurrence occurred 16 months after
frontline study enrollment (broken line, n 5 29) had a significantly better
outcome after disease recurrence than patients whose recurrence occurred
sooner (solid line, n 5 37) (5-year survival estimates, 15.3%  6.3% vs
8.1%  5.5%; P 5 .006). Lines indicate recurrence <16 months (LT) versus
16 months (GE) after study enrollment.

Figure 2, the 5-year estimate of PRS was
15.3%  6.3% for patients whose disease recurrence
occurred 16 months after study enrollment and
8.1%  5.5% for patients whose recurrence occurred
sooner (P 5 .006). We used 16 months because it was
the lower boundary of the 95% CI for the median
time to recurrence after frontline therapy. Results
were similar when disease recurrence before versus
after 18 months was analyzed.
Of the 5 patients who remained alive after disease recurrence/progression, 4 had INSS stage 4 disease and 1 had INSS stage 3 disease. MYCN status
was available for 4 of these patients, none of whom
had amplified MYCN. The interval between study
enrollment and first disease recurrence for these 5
patients was 6.7 to 36.1 months (median, 18.6
months). At the time of last follow-up, all 5 patients
were alive with no evidence of disease, >5 years after
first recurrence.

Disease Control Intervals
In the study group overall, the median time between
frontline protocol enrollment and first disease recurrence was 18.3 months (95% CI, 15.9–22.4 months).
Of the 66 patients who experienced disease recurrence or progression, 58 had a second recurrence,
a median of 7.2 months (range, 0.4–29.0 months) after the first recurrence; 4 patients had not experienced second disease recurrence and were alive 11.8
years, 6.9 years, 4.8 years, and 3.0 years, respectively,
after first recurrence; and 3 patients had died the day
of (1 patient) or the day after (2 patients) first recur-

rence. The remaining patient died of neuroblastoma
4.6 years after first disease recurrence, but information regarding second or subsequent disease recurrences was unavailable because the patient did not
return to St. Jude for treatment. This patient was
excluded from the disease control analysis. The 3
patients who died at the time of first disease recurrence were censored at their times of death.
Among the 65 patients analyzed who had at least
1 recurrence, the estimated median time from first to
second disease recurrence was 8.7 months (95% CI,
5.0–12.2 months). Of the 58 patients who had at least
2 recurrences, 44 experienced a third recurrence at a
median of 3.5 months (range, 0.3–18.7 months) after
the second disease recurrence, 1 had a second malignancy after the second disease recurrence, 6 died at
the time of the second recurrence, 2 died within 2
weeks of the second recurrence (3 days and 12 days
afterward, respectively), and 1 was alive at the time
of last follow-up, 4.0 years after second disease recurrence (5.5 years after frontline study enrollment).
The remaining 4 patients died 4.7 months, 5.6
months, 9.2 months, and 13.2 months, respectively,
after second disease recurrence (information regarding a third recurrence was not available). Patients
who died before a third disease recurrence were censored at the date of death. The patient who had a
second malignancy after second disease recurrence
was censored at the date of the diagnosis of a second
malignancy. The estimated median time from second
to third recurrence was 3.8 months (range, 2.5–5.4
months).
Table 2 shows estimates of the median time to
first, second, and third disease recurrence (15.7
months, 7.2 months, and 3.5 months, respectively).
The disease control interval decreased by approximately half after each successive disease recurrence,
as illustrated by Figure 3.
All patients that died immediately before or after
first or second disease recurrence had rapidly progressive systemic tumor (epidural, hepatic, peritoneal, renal, central nervous system) and the parents
chose no further interventions.

DISCUSSION
Herein, we report the disease progression intervals in
a large cohort of children with advanced stage neuroblastoma who were treated on successive frontline
protocols at a single institution. These patients face a
very poor prognosis; only 5 of 66 patients in the current series experienced durable long-term remission
after disease recurrence. The 5-year estimate of survival after recurrence was 11%  4%. However, the

distribution of time-to-event profiles suggests that
the disease behaves differently in subsets of patients.
Recurrence of the original tumor is the leading cause
of late mortality in neuroblastoma patients, and 38%
of the deaths occurred within 1 year after the first
disease recurrence. However, 16 of 66 patients (24%)
were alive 3 years after the first recurrence. Similarly,
patients with a longer first disease remission (16
months) survived longer than others after disease recurrence. The duration of first disease remission
appears to be a powerful predictor of outcome in
patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well.
Five (8%) patients in the current series remained
alive >5 years after disease recurrence. These
patients may have been cured by salvage therapy or
may represent variant cases of ‘chronic neuroblastoma.’15 Such patients characteristically demonstrate
improvement of symptoms and may have prolonged

mixed responses to therapy, but the disease eventually progresses. A similar course typically follows
subsequent salvage attempts. To our knowledge, the
clinical features and biologic tumor characteristics
that uniquely identify this subset of patients currently are unknown. However, investigators designing
future salvage protocols should note that a subset of
patients will be ‘chronic’ survivors despite previous
treatment failures.
Disease progression data are of value in planning
the testing of new therapy agents for neuroblastoma.
Patients must be selected for these trials on the basis
of clinical characteristics at the time of disease recurrence and the anticipated subsequent disease control
or progression intervals. This information can be
derived from historic data such as that presented
herein, allowing studies to be stratified on the basis
of the number of previous disease recurrences and
by the estimated disease control intervals. In the absence of these considerations, phase 1 and 2 studies
of different agents might be conducted in study
populations that are not comparable, and agents
could be inappropriately discarded or considered
effective when the results are confounded by the natural course of the clinical disease.
Many of the newer molecularly targeted agents
are cytostatic and are unlikely to cause tumor regression (the current standard of response in pediatric
oncology drug development). Furthermore, they may
not show their effect until after the first 2 courses of
therapy (the conventional evaluation period in many
pediatric oncology phase 2 trials). Therefore, use of
the traditional phase 1/2 study response endpoints
may obscure the true activity of new antineuroblastoma agents. Recent data from trials of new agents
in adults suggest that progression-free survival may
be the most appropriate outcome for comparison of
new versus standard chemotherapeutic agents. For
example, sorafenib was found to significantly
improved progression-free survival in adults with

Neuroblastoma Control Intervals/Santana et al.

advanced renal cell carcinoma, despite having only a
2% partial response rate (and no complete
responses) by standard criteria.16 Sunitinib significantly reduced time to progression of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors yet had only a 7%
response rate (no complete responses).17 In addition,
neuro-oncologists have recently advocated progression-free survival at 6 months as a significant endpoint for assessing a new intervention for brainstem
glioma. The historic disease control (progression)
distributions must be defined for patients who have
had multiple recurrences of neuroblastoma so that
appropriate boundaries can be established for exploratory studies of new agents.
Many barriers stand in the way of neuroblastoma
clinical trials that incorporate new agents.18 It is difficult to choose the best agent to carry forward, the
population of patients available for study is small, the
profitability of clinical development is likely to be low,
and the endpoints for use in regulatory approval are
not well defined for this disease.19 Furthermore, at
most, only 1 large phase 3 neuroblastoma trial can be
conducted every 5 to 7 years; therefore, it is imperative
that phase 2 trials be designed optimally for selection
of the best agent (or therapy modality) to bring forward. A better understanding of the natural course of
neuroblastoma in patients undergoing salvage therapy
and the use of historic data to inform the design of exploratory phase 2 trials will help to serve this purpose.
In parallel, new validated imaging and laboratory
tools, such as positron emission tomography scans
with metabolic markers, may help to advance our
understanding of the effects of a given treatment on
the tumor and of whether the imaging changes reflect
a specific cellular response.20,21
In summary, we recommend that in designing
exploratory trials of new agents for neuroblastoma,
investigators and sponsors incorporate the historic
disease control intervals for the population and use
progression-free survival as a primary endpoint.
These steps may allow us to better distinguish the
clinical benefit of such agents and facilitate the regulatory approval process.
